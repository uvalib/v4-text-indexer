Oh kingly Jove, shall there be no more day?

There's my young hopeful too, he sleeps it through, Snug under five fat blankets at the least. Would I could sleep so sound! but my poor eyes Have no sleep in them; what with debts and duns And stable-keepers' bills, which this fine spark Heaps on my back, I lie awake the whilst: And what cares he but to coil up his locks, Ride, drive his horses, dream of them all night, Whilst I, poor devil, may go hang—for now The moon The term for enforcing payments and taking out execution against debtors, according to usage, was in near approach. in her last quarter wains apace, And my usurious creditors are gaping. What hoa! a light! bring me my tablets, boy! That I may set down all, and sum them up, Debts, creditors, and interest upon interest— [Boy enters with a light and tablets. Let me see where I am and what the total— Twelve pounds The Athenian pound was of the value of one hundred drachmas, and each drachma of six oboli. The pound may be computed at three of our's, which gives the price of the horse about 36l. to Pasias—Hah! to Pasias twelve! Out on it, and for what? A horse forsooth, Right noble by the mark In the original the mark is pointed out to have been that of the koppa, whence these horses were called koppatiæ, as those stamped with the sigma were named samphoræ. The bucephali had the mark of the ox's head, and probably Alexander's favorite charger was of this sort.—Curse on such marks! Would I had giv'n this eye from out this head, Ere I had paid the purchase of this jennet! Phidip. Shame on you, Philo!—Keep within your ring. Streps. There 'tis! that's it! the bane of all my peace— He's racing in his sleep. Phidip. A heat—a heat! How many turns to a heat? Streps. More than enough; You've giv'n me turns in plenty—I am jaded. But to my list—What name stands next to Pasias? Amynias Aminias was the archon when this comedy was acted, and the poet makes use of his name in the way of ridicule, spelling it however Amynias instead of Aminias. At length the persons of the archons were, by a special law, protected from ridicule and detraction.—three good pounds—still for the race— A chariot The chariot or curricle here alluded to was built extremely light, with a seat for the driver, and wheels of a stated construction, for the race. The price annexed to it bespeaks it to have been of slight and simple workmanship. mounted on its wheels complete. Phidip. Dismount! unharness and away! Streps. I thank you; You have unharness'd me: I am dismounted, And with a vengeance—All my goods in pawn, Fines, forfeitures, and penalties in plenty. Phidip. (wakes.) My father! why so restless? who has vex'd you? Streps.

Peace, self-tormenter, let me sleep! Streps. Sleep on! But take this with you; all these debts of mine Will double on your head: a plague confound That cursed match-maker, who drew me in To wed, forsooth, that precious dam of thine. I liv'd at ease in the country, coarsely clad, Rough, free, and full withal as oil and honey And store of stock could fill me, till I took, Clown as I was, this limb of the Alcmæon's, Strepsiades says he married his wife out of the family of Megacles, descended from Alcmæon, and one of the first nobility in Athens. This vain, extravagant, high-blooded dame: Rare bed-fellows and dainty—were we not? I, smelling of the wine-vat, figs and fleeces, The produce of my farm, all essence she, This is one of many passages in this author, where the language of translation cannot be made to embrace the full spirit of the original. Strepsiades, describing the character of his wife as contrasted with himself, says (in the phrase of Eretria) that she was ????????????????, lavish in the ornaments of her person as Cæsyra, made up by all the artifice of the toilette, (or in one word Cæsyrafied.) There were two ladies of this name, one the wife of Alcmæon, the other of Pisistratus, and as Strepsiades has already placed his wife in the family of the former, it seems most likely that his ridicule points at the elder Cæsyra, though both were examples equally apposite. Saffron and harlot's kisses, paint and washes, A pamper'd wanton—Idle I'll not call her; She took due pains in faith to work my ruin, Which made me tell her, pointing to this cloak, Now thread-bare on my shoulders—see, good wife, This is your work—in troth you toil too hard. [Boy re-enters. Boy. Master, the lamp has drank up all its oil. Streps. Aye, 'tis a drunken lamp; the more fault your's; Whelp, you shall howl for this. Boy. Why? for what fault? Streps. For cramming such a greedy wick with oil. [Exit Boy. Well! in good time this hopeful heir was born; Then I and my beloved fell to wrangling About the naming of the brat—My wife Would dub her colt Xanthippus or Charippus, In all these names of the wife's proposing she keeps her own family in view. Xanthippus and Charippus are proper names; the first was the father of Pericles: Callias was an Olympic victor, and that she ingeniously compounds. The name Phidonides, which Strepsiades contends for, is a compounded term, that implies a man addicted to parsimony; the compromise therefore for Phidippides is so contrived as to suit both parties. Or it might be Callipides, she car'd not So 'twere a horse, which shar'd the name—but I Stuck for his grandfather Phidonides; At last when neither could prevail, the matter Was compromis'd by calling him Phidippides: Then she began to fondle her sweet babe, And taking him by th'hand—lambkin, she cried, When thou art some years older thou shalt drive, Megacles-like, thy chariot to the city, Rob'd in a saffron mantle—No, quoth I, Not so, my boy, but thou shalt drive thy goats, When thou art able, from the fields of Phelle, A rocky district of Attica, which afforded pasturage only to goats. Clad in a woollen jacket like thy father: But he is deaf to all these frugal rules, And drives me on the gallop to my ruin; Therefore all night I call my thoughts to council, And after long debate find one chance left, To which if I can lead him, all is safe, If not—but soft? 'tis time that I should wake him. But how to soothe him to the task—Phidippides! Precious Phidippides! Phidip. What now, my father? Streps. Kiss me, my boy! reach me thine hand— Phidip. Declare, What would you? Streps. Dost thou love me, sirrah? speak! Phidip. Aye, by equestrian Neptune! Streps. Name not him, Name not that charioteer; he is my bane, The source of all my sorrow—but, my son, If thou dost love me, prove it by obedience. Phidip. In what must I obey? Streps. Reform your habits; Quit them at once, and what I shall prescribe That do! Phidip. And what is it that you prescribe? Streps. But wilt thou do't? Phidip. Yea, by Dionysus! The poet is duly attentive to character in these asseverations, which he puts into the mouth of his young man, making him first swear by equestrian Neptune, and when driven from that, resorting to Dionysus, the patron of the feast now in actual celebration, called the Dionysia: this was also the more apposite, as it was now this very comedy was in representation. I have therefore accorded to the original term, in preference to that of Bacchus, which Brunck and other translators have adopted. Streps. 'Tis well: get up! come hither, boy; look out! Yon little wicket and the hut hard by— Do'st see them? Phidip. Clearly. What of that same hut? Streps. Why that's the council-chamber of all wisdom: There the choice spirits dwell, who teach the world That heav'n's great concave is one mighty oven, And men its burning embers: these are they, Who can show pleaders how to twist a cause, How cunningly the poet slides in his satire before he betrays the personality attached to it! He exposes the doctrines, before he gives the names, of these philosophers, and those doctrines he describes to be of that species of sophistry, by which men are taught to evade the laws, and defraud their creditors, than which there cannot well be any greater offence against society. So you'll but pay them for it, right or wrong. Phidip. And how do you call them? Streps. Troth I know not that, It is worth a remark, that to this question of the son, the rustic father pleads ignorance, by which the poet artfully transfers the first naming of Socrates and Chærephon from that person, who must have spoken of them respectfully to him, who now announces them to the audience with all the contempt and obloquy peculiar to his character. This is one amongst many instances of the poet's address, which the critic cannot fail to discover in this opening scene. But they are men, who take a world of pains; Wond'rous good men and able. Phidip. Out upon 'em! Poor rogues, I know them now; you mean those scabs, Those squalid, barefoot, beggarly impostors, The mighty cacodæmons of whose sect Are Socrates and Chærephon. Had it happily so chanced, that the first comedy of The Clouds had been preserved, it would have been a most gratifying circumstance to have traced the author's contrivances for turning his experience of a past miscarriage to account in a second attempt. I think it highly probable that this of coupling Chærephon with Socrates was one of his expedients to avoid the shock of bringing him too abruptly before the audience; and though no management might serve for bringing over his determined supporters, yet by grounding his attack upon the principles of universal justice, and classing him with an associate so contemptible as Chærephone, nicknamed “the Bat,” he takes the likeliest means of interesting the audience in general for his comedy. Away! Streps. Hush, hush! be still; don't vent such foolish prattle; But if you'll take my counsel, join their college And quit your riding school. Phidip. Not I, so help me Dionysus our patron! though you brib'd me With all the racers that Leogarus Breeds from his Phasian Whether the ???????? are to be understood literally as pheasants, or as horses so described, is a disputed point with the grammarians. Leogarus was famous for his breed of horses; he was also a notorious glutton; his character of course accords to each interpretation. I have inclined to the latter, as thinking it more in character of the speaker, and as I find the country on the banks of the Phasis celebrated for its breed of horses, I prefer that construction to any other. stud. Streps. Dear, darling lad, Prythee be rul'd, and learn. Phidip. What shall I learn? Streps. They have a choice of logic; this for justice, The great aim of this comedy is to hold up to ridicule and detestation that Socratic mode of arguing by quirk and quibble, which is here termed the unjust, and elsewhere the new, sophistry. As this will be brought into full discussion in a subsequent scene, I shall postpone any further remarks for the present. That for injustice: learn that latter art, And all these creditors, that now beset me, Shall never touch a drachm that I owe them. Phidip. I'll learn of no such masters, nor be made A scare-crow and a may-game to my comrades: I have no zeal for starving. Streps. No, nor I For feasting you and your fine pamper'd cattle At free cost any longer—Horse and foot To the crows I bequeath you. So be gone. Phidip. Well, sir, I have an uncle rich and noble; Megacles will not let me be unhors'd; To him I go: I'll trouble you no longer. The poet in this opening scene exhibits a considerable share of dramatic skill and contrivance: it developes just as much of the fable, as is proper for the audience to be apprised of, and prepares them for the introduction of the principal character after a very artful manner. The intervention of the servant boy, first with the tablets, and next with his report of the lamp, together with the speakings of Phidippides in his sleep, are pleasantly and ingeniously thrown in to break the soliloquies of the old man, whose story, though humorously told, would else be too long in detail. The part, which the son holds in the scene, is also very characteristic, and his sallies in his dream (in which the author seems to have Æschylus in his eye) have a great deal of point and stage effect. The same may be remarked of the art observed in introducing the first mention of Socrates and his school, and the explanation Strepsiades gives of the purposes, for which he would have his son resort thither. The base nature of those purposes and the abhorrence of the young man are cunning preparatives for the introduction of Socrates, and for biassing the spectators in favour of the personal attack, which the poet is now meditating against that eminent philosopher. The attempt was daring, and had once already failed; warned by this miscarriage, he now lays his plan with more precaution, and it is not easy to conceive any better generalship than he displays upon this second attack. If there is any thing in this scene open to critical reprehension, I conceive it to be that the speakings of Strepsiades are of a higher cast here than in his succeeding dialogues with Socrates, where the poet (for the sake no doubt of contrasting his rusticity with the finesse of the philosopher) has lowered him to the stile and sentiment of an arrant clown. Of this the reader will be able to judge as he advances; but I dare say the humor of the dialogue will atone for any small departure from uniformity of character, if any such in fact does exist. [Exit. Streps. (alone.) He has thrown me to the ground, but I'll not lie there; I'll up, and with permission of the gods Try if I cannot learn these arts myself: But being old, sluggish, and dull of wit, How am I sure these subtleties won't pose me? Well! I'll attempt it: what avails complaint? Why don't I knock and enter?—Hoa! within there!— (Knocks violently at the door; a disciple calls out from within.) Disciple. Go hang yourself! and give the crows a dinner— What noisy fellow art thou at the door? Streps. Strepsiades of Cicynna, son of Phidon. A citizen of the tribe of Acamas. Disciple. Whoe'er thou art, 'fore Heaven, thou art a fool Not to respect these doors; battering so loud, And kicking with such vengeance, you have marr'd The ripe conception of my pregnant brain, And brought on a miscarriage. Streps. Oh! the pity— Pardon my ignorance: I'm country bred And far a-field am come: I pray you tell me What curious thought my luckless din has strangled, Just as your brain was hatching. Disciple. These are things We never speak of but amongst ourselves. Streps. Speak boldly then to me, for I am come To be amongst you, and partake the secrets Of your profound academy. Disciple. Enough! I will impart, but set it down in thought Amongst our mysteries—This is the question, As it was put but now to Chærephon, By our great master Socrates, to answer— How many of his own lengths at one spring A flea can hop—for we did see one vault From Chærephon's Chærephon was swarthy, and on that account, as well as for his shrill and querulous speech, nicknamed the Bat. Socrates was bald. black eye-brow to the head Of the philosopher. Streps. And how did t'other Contrive to measure this? Disciple. Most accurately: He dipt the insect's feet in melted wax, Which, hard'ning into sandals as it cool'd, Gave him the space by rule infallible. Streps. Imperial Jove! what subtilty of thought! Disciple. But there's a deeper question yet behind; What would you say to that? Streps. I pray, impart it. Disciple. 'Twas put to Socrates, if he could say, When a gnat humm'd, whether the sound did issue From mouth or tail. Streps. Aye; marry, what said he? Disciple. He said your gnat doth blow his trumpet backwards From a sonorous cavity within him, Which being fill'd with breath, and forc'd along The narrow pipe or rectum of his body, Doth vent itself in a loud hum behind. Streps. Hah! then I see the podex of your gnat Is trumpet-fashion'd—Oh! the blessings on him For this discovery; well may he escape The law's strict scrutiny, who thus developes The dramatic critic will see the point of this inference, and give the poet credit for it. The anatomy of a gnat. Disciple. Nor is this all; Another grand experiment was blasted By a curst cat. Streps. As how, good sir; discuss? Disciple. One night as he was gazing at the moon, Curious and all intent upon her motions, A cat on the house ridge was at her needs, And squirted in his face. Streps. Beshrew her for it! Yet I must laugh no less to think a cat Should so bespatter Socrates. Disciple. Last night We were bilk'd of our supper. Streps. Were you so? What did your master substitute instead? Disciple. Why to say truth, he sprinkled a few ashes Upon the board, then with a little broach, Crook'd for the nonce, pretending to describe A circle, neatly filch'd away a cloak. Streps. Why talk we then of Thales? It was a custom with Aristophanes to call a man, who was devoted to astronomical studies, a Thales. We are therefore to understand that Socrates is represented as engaging the attention of his pupils by some astronomical schemes, traced out on the table, whilst he took the opportunity of purloining a cloak. This would have been a very dangerous joke for the poet to have risqued, if some such idle stories had not been in circulation; but this was the case, and other authors are quoted as having made the same charge. Open to me, Open the school, and let me see your master: Aristophanes well knew how impossible it was for the friends of Socrates to stem the laugh of a theatre; he perfectly understood the use of that weapon, which in his hands was so formidable, and devotes the whole preceding scene to ridicule of that farcical kind, which was so well adapted to the false taste of the Athenians, to whom even the grossest buffooneries were acceptable. Having therefore in his first scene set out by stating the iniquitous sophistry of the Socratic school, he next proceeds to ridicule their frivolous inquiries and experiments, and with this view introduces a disciple, who, with much solemnity, is made to betray the secrets of his master, and to tell such tales to the disgrace of his philosophy, and even of his honesty, as are calculated, with the aid of the old man's comments, to raise a laugh against Socrates, just in the moment when he is prepared to open the scene of his academy, and exhibit his person in the most ridiculous attitude his fancy could devise. I am on fire to enter—Come, unbar! (The School is disclosed.) O Hercules, defend me! who are these? What kind of cattle have we here in view? Disciple. Where is the wonder? What do they resemble? Streps. Methinks they're like our Spartan prisoners, Captur'd at Pylos. What are they in search of? Why are their eyes so rivetted to th'earth? Disciple. There their researches center. Streps. 'Tis for onions He had before said they were like the Lacedæmonian prisoners, emaciated and half-starved, he therefore supposes them on the search for food and not for science. They are in quest—Come, lads, give o'er your search; I'll show you what you want, a noble plat, All round and sound—but soft! what mean those gentry, Who dip their heads so low? Disciple. Marry, because Their studies lead that way: They are now diving To the dark realms of Tartarus and Night. Streps. But why are all their cruppers mounted up? Disciple. To practise them in star-gazing, and teach them Their proper elevations—but no more: Come, fellow-students, let us hence, or ere The master comes— Streps. Nay, prythee let 'em stay, And be of council with me in my business. Disciple. Impossible; they cannot give the time. Streps. Now for the love of Heav'n, what have we here? Explain their uses to me. (observing the apparatus.) Disciple. This machine Is for astronomy— Streps. And this? Disciple. For geometry. Streps. As how? Disciple. For measuring the earth. Streps. Indeed! What by the lot? Disciple. No, faith, Sir, by the lump; Ev'n the whole globe at once. Streps. Well said, in troth. A quaint device, and made for general use. Disciple. Look now, this line marks the circumference Of the whole earth, d'ye see—This spot is Athens— Streps. Athens! go to, I see no courts are sitting; This is the same sort of reproach, which Demosthenes afterwards made use of. Their character, in short, was frivolous, and their caprice unpardonable. This whole scene is raillery of a serious sort, and in this place, where it was so much his interest to keep up the laugh, unsuitably applied. Therefore I can't believe you. Disciple. Nay, in truth, This very tract is Attica. Streps. And where, Where is my own Cicynna? Disciple. Here it lies: And this Eubœa—Mark! how far it runs— Streps. How far it runs! Yes, Pericles has made it Run far enough from us—Where's Lacedæmon? Disciple. Here; close to Athens. Streps. Ah! how much too close— Prythee, good friends, take that bad neighbour from us. Disciple. That's not for us to do. Streps. The worse luck your's! But look! who's this suspended in a basket? It is clear that the philosopher does not remain suspended in his basket during the preceding scene, because the disciple warns away his fellow-students, lest their master should discover them. If the poet had spared his politics about Eubœa and Lacedæmon, I should conceive his audience might have been in a better humor for receiving an incident of so singular and daring a sort, as the debût of the philosopher in a basket; but no doubt he knew the people he had to deal with. (Socrates is discovered.) Disciple. This, this is he. Streps. What he? Disciple. Why, Socrates. Streps. Hah! Socrates?—Make up to him and roar, Bid him come down; roar lustily. Disciple. Not I: Do it yourself; I've other things to mind. [Exit. Streps. Hoa! Socrates—What hoa, my little Socrates! Socr. Mortal, how now! To give the philosopher a mock sublimity, he elevates him above the heads of his fellow-creatures by the vehicle of a basket, and then makes him speak in a stile correspondent to the loftiness of his station, a language suited to the character of a demigod. Thou insect of a day, What would'st thou? Streps. I would know what thou art doing. Socr. I tread in air, contemplating the sun. Streps. Ah, then I see you're basketed so high, That you look down upon the Gods—Good hope, You'll lower a peg on earth. Socr. Sublime in air, Sublime in thought I carry my mind with me, Its cogitations all assimilated To the pure atmosphere, in which I float; Lower me to earth, and my mind's subtle powers, Seiz'd by contagious dulness, lose their spirit; For the dry earth drinks up the generous sap, The vegetating vigor of philosophy, And leaves it a mere husk. Streps. What do you say? Philosophy has sapt your vigor? Fie upon it. But come, my precious fellow, come down quickly, And teach me those fine things I'm here in quest of. Socr. And what fine things are they? Streps. A new receipt For sending off my creditors, and foiling them By the art logical; for you shall know By debts, pawns, pledges, usuries, executions, I am rackt and rent in tatters. Socr. Why permit it? What strange infatuation seiz'd your senses? Streps. The horse consumption, a devouring plague; But so you'll enter me amongst your scholars, And tutor me like them to bilk my creditors, Name your own price, and by the Gods I swear I'll pay you the last drachm. Socr. By what Gods? Answer that first; for your Gods are not mine. Streps. How swear you then? This whole dialogue, between two characters so forcibly contrasted, is conceived in the very best stile of the author. That this eminent philosopher was not an orthodox heathen, may well be believed; that the poet himself was not less of a free-thinker, may fairly be inferred from a variety of passages in his surviving comedies, where the Deities and even Jupiter himself are treated with so little ceremony, or rather with such sovereign contempt, that we must suppose no danger was attached to the avowal of these free opinions, and of course no serious design to entrap the life of Socrates by this raillery could be in the contemplation of Aristophanes at the time. It seems to be nothing more than a mere vehicle for introducing in chorus of fanciful beings, in like manner with those of his frogs, birds, and wasps, which are all cast in the same whimsical characters with this of The Clouds. It is, however, a very apposite allusion of the clown, when he asks him if he swears, as the Byzantians do, by the beggarly oath of their own base coining. As the Byzantians swear By their base iron coin? Socr. Art thou ambitious To be instructed in celestial matters, And taught to know them clearly? Streps. Marry am I, So they be to my purpose, and celestial. Socr. What, if I bring you to a conference With my own proper Goddesses, the Clouds? Streps. 'Tis what I wish devoutly. Socr. Come, sit down; Repose yourself upon this couch. Streps. 'Tis done. Socr. Now take this chaplet—wear it. Streps. Why this chaplet? Would'st make of me another Athamas, Rescued by Hercules, when on the point of being immolated to the manes of Phryxus. And sacrifice me to a cloud? Socr. Fear nothing; It is a ceremony indispensible At all initiations. Streps. What to gain? Socr. 'Twill sift your faculties as fine as powder, Bolt 'em like meal, grind 'em as light as dust; Only be patient. Streps. Marry, you'll go near To make your words good; an' you pound me thus You'll make me very dust and nothing else. (Anapests.) Socr. Keep silence then, and listen to a prayer, Which fits the gravity of age to hear— Oh! Air, all powerful Air, which dost enfold This pendant globe, thou vault of flaming gold, Ye sacred Clouds, who bid the thunder roll, Shine forth, approach, and cheer your suppliant's soul! Streps. Hold, keep 'em off awhile, till I am ready. Ah! luckless me, wou'd I had brought my bonnet, And so escap'd a soaking. Socr. Come, come away! Fly swift, ye clouds, and give yourselves to view! Whether on high Olympus' sacred top Snow-crown'd ye sit, or in the azure vales Of your own father Ocean sporting weave Your misty dance, or dip your golden urns In the seven mouths of Nile; whether ye dwell On Thracian Mimas, or Mœotis' lake, Hear me, yet hear, and thus invok'd approach! Chorus of Clouds. Ascend, ye watery Clouds, on high, Daughters of Ocean, climb the sky, And o'er the mountain's pine-cap't brow Towering your fleecy mantle throw: Thence let us scan the wide-stretch'd scene, Groves, lawns, and rilling streams between, And stormy Neptune's vast expanse, And grasp all nature at a glance. Now the dark tempest flits away, And lo! the glittering orb of day Darts forth his clear etherial beam, Come let us snatch the joyous gleam. Socr. Yes, ye Divinities, whom I adore, I hail you now propitious to my prayer. Did'st thou not hear them speak in thunder to me? After Socrates has performed his solemn incantation, the Clouds give sign of their approach by thunder, and, that ceasing, they chant their lyric ode in the stile of Archilochus, as they are supposed to be descending towards the earth, and as yet out of sight. The effect of this was probably very striking. Streps. And I too am your Cloudships' most obedient, And under sufferance trump against your thunder: Nay, take it how you may, my frights and fears Have pinch'd and cholick'd my poor bowels so, That I can't chuse but treat your holy nostrils With an unsavory sacrifice. Socr. Forbear These gross scurrilities, for low buffoons And mountebanks more fitting. Hush! be still, List to the chorus of their heavenly voices, For music is the language they delight in. Chorus of Clouds. Ye Clouds, replete with fruitful showers, Here let us seek Minerva's towers, The cradle of old Cecrops' race, The world's chief ornament and grace; Here mystic fanes and rites divine And lamps in sacred splendor shine; Here the Gods dwell in marble domes, Feasted with costly hecatombs, That round their votive statues blaze, Whilst crowded temples ring with praise; And pompous sacrifices here Make holidays throughout the year, And when gay spring-time comes again, Bromius convokes his sportive train, And pipe and song and choral dance Hail the soft hours as they advance. Streps. Now in the name of Jove I pray thee tell me Who are these ranting dames, that talk in stilts? Of the Amazonian cast no doubt. Socr. Not so, No dames, but clouds celestial, friendly powers To men of sluggish parts; from these we draw Sense, apprehension, volubility, Wit to confute, and cunning to ensnare. Streps. Aye, therefore 'twas that my heart leapt within me For very sympathy when first I heard 'em: Now I could prattle shrewdly of first causes, And spin out metaphysic cobwebs finely, And dogmatize most rarely, and dispute And paradox it with the best of you: So, come what may, I must and will behold 'em; Show me their faces I conjure you. Socr. Look, Look towards Mount Parnes as I point—There, there! Now they descend the hill; I see them plainly As plain as can be. Streps. Where, where? I prythee, show me. Socr. Here! a whole troop of them thro' woods and hollows, A bye-way of their own. Streps. What ails my eyes, That I can't catch a glimpse of them? Socr. Behold! Here at the very entrance— Streps. Never trust me, If yet I see them clearly. Socr. Then you must be Sand-blind or worse. Streps. Nay, now by father Jove, There is more play in this dialogue upon the introduction of the chorus than is generally to be found in the dry and simple conduct of the Greek drama. The magic powers and solemn style of the philosophy, the coarse rusticity and comic credulity of Strepsiades, with the chorus first heard in the air, then after a long and tantalizing expectation, brought personally on the stage as a troop of damsels, habited no doubt in character, and floating cloud-like in the dance, whilst the dialogue proceeds explanatory on the part of Socrates, are all contrived with much address, and with great attention to spectacle and stage effect. I cannot chuse but see them—precious creatures! For in good faith here's plenty and to spare. (Chorus of Clouds enter.) Socr. And didst thou doubt if they were goddesses? Streps. Not I, so help me! only I'd a notion That they were fog, and dew, and dusky vapor. Socr. For shame! why, man, these are the nursing mothers Of all our famous sophists, fortune-tellers, Quacks, The groupe Socrates here gives us of cloud-inspired worthies has great comic point; it is the reply of sophistry to common sense, which had struck upon the ruth in a very natural solution of their properties, supposing them to be fog and vapor. It is an answer so contrived as to recoil upon himself. med'cine-mongers, bards bombastical, Chorus projectors, star interpreters And wonder-making cheats—The gang of idlers, Who pay them for their feeding with good store Of flattery and mouth-worship. Streps. Now I see Whom we may thank for driving them along At such a furious dithyrambic This rant is glanced at the dithyrambic writers, and Suidas says it points particularly at Philoxenus, whose compound epithets are here retailed in ridicule of his bombast and turgid diction. The satire is fair, but perhaps the old clown is not strictly the person who should be the vehicle of it. rate, Sun-shadowing clouds of many-color'd hues, Air-rending tempests, hundred-headed Typhons; Now rousing, rattling them about our ears, Now gently wafting them adown the sky, Moist, airy, bending, bursting into showers; For all which fine descriptions the poor knaves Dine daintily on scraps. Socr. And proper fare; What better do they merit? Streps. Under favor, If these be clouds, (d'you mark me?) very clouds, How came they metamorphos'd into women? Clouds are not such as these. Socr. And what else are they? Streps. Troth, I can't rightly tell, but I should guess Something like flakes of wool, not women sure; And look! these dames have noses— Socr. Hark you, friend, I'll put a question to you. Streps. Out with it! Be quick: let's have it. Socr. This it is in short— Hast thou ne'er seen a cloud, which thou could'st fancy Shap'd like a centaur, leopard, wolf or bull? Streps. Yea, marry, have I, and what then? Socr. Why then Clouds can assume what shapes they will, believe me; For instance; shou'd they spy some hairy clown Rugged and rough and like the unlick't cub Hieronymus, the dithyrambic poet, son of Xenophantes, is here aimed at: The original passage specifies an unnatural vice, which the clouds very appositely mark under the appearance of libidinous centaurs. Of Xenophantes, strait they turn to centaurs, And kick at him for vengeance. Streps. Well done, Clouds? But should they spy that peculating knave, Simon, Simon the sophist is satyrized also by Eupolis for his great and notorious public frauds. that public thief, how would they treat him? Socr. As wolves—in character most like his own. Streps. Aye, there it is now, when they saw Cleonymus, Cleonymus had incurred the infamy of throwing away his shield in battle, and betaking himself to flight; the poet marks the affair as recent, and treats it with proportionable severity. That dastard run-away, they turn'd to hinds In honor of his cowardice. Socr. And now, Having seen Clisthenes, Clisthenes was a character so contemptibly effeminate and vicious withal, that the impurity of his manners became proverbial. We find him in a fragment of Cratinus, and in other passages of our author. In this place he is peculiarly well brought in, and helps Socrates to a very ingenious solution of the question put to him by Strepsiades, how his Clouds came to be metamorphosed into women. to mock his lewdness They change themselves to women. Streps. Welcome, ladies! Imperial ladies, welcome! An' it please Your Highnesses so far to grace a mortal, Give me a touch of your celestial voices. Chor. Hail, grandsire! who at this late hour of life Would'st go to school for cunning, and all hail, Thou prince pontifical of quirks and quibbles, Speak thy full mind, make known thy wants and wishes? Thee and our worthy Prodicus A famous sophist, native of Ceos, and a disciple of Protagoras, founder of the title, whose writings were condemned to the flames by decree of the Athenians: the fate of Prodicus was more severe, inasmuch as he was put to death by poison, as a teacher of doctrines which corrupted the youth of Athens. There was something prophetic in thus grouping him with Socrates. excepted, Not one of all your sophists have our ear: Him for his wit and learning we esteem, Thee for thy proud deportment and high looks, In barefoot beggary strutting up and down, Content to suffer mockery for our sake, And carry a grave face whilst others laugh. Streps. Oh! mother earth, was ever voice like this, So reverend, so portentous, so divine? Socr. These are your only deities, all else I flout at. Streps. Hold! Olympian Jupiter— Is he no god? Socr. What Jupiter? Here is a strong assertion grafted on the character of Socrates, but the levity it is introduced with, and the ridiculous comments Strepsiades makes upon it, argue no peculiar malice in the intention. what God? Prythee no more—away with him at once. Streps. Say'st thou? who gives us rain? answer me that. Socr. These give us rain; as I will strait demonstrate: Come on now—When did you e'er see it rain Without a cloud? If Jupiter gives rain, Let him rain down his favors in the sunshine, The scholiast in his note upon this passage, give us an allusion to a story of a certain Myscelus, who upon consulting the oracle, was directed to found a city in that very spot, where he should be caught in a shower whilst the sky was clear. Despairing of an event so unnatural, he had the address to interpret the tears of his mistress as the fulfilment of the oracle, and proceeded to complete his project accordingly. Nor ask the clouds to help him. Streps. You have hit it, 'Tis so; heav'n help me, I did think till now, When t'was his godship's pleasure, he made water Into a sieve and gave the earth a shower. But, hark'ye me, who thunders? tell me that; For then it is I tremble. Socr. These, these thunder, When they are tumbled. Streps. How, blasphemer, how? Socr. When they are charg'd with vapors full to th'bursting, And bandied to and fro against each other, Then with the shock they burst and crack amain. Streps. And who is he that jowls them thus together But Jove himself? Socr. Jove! 'tis not Jove that does it, But the ætherial vortex. The ætherial vortex, ???????? ????? is referable to the philosopher Anaxagoras, and it is a general remark, which the reader should bear in mind, that all the satire bestowed upon the character of Socrates in this comedy is not pointed personally, but through his vehicle at various sophists and philosophers, as they fall in the poet's way: Socrates was known to direct all his studies to morality, and to rescue his philosophy from abstruse researches, as Cicero testifies. Streps. What is he? I never heard of him; is he not Jove? Or is Jove put aside and Vortex crown'd King of Olympus in his state and place? But let me learn some more of this same thunder. Socr. Have you not learnt? I told you how the clouds, Being surcharg'd with vapor, rush together And in the conflict shake the poles with thunder. Streps. But who believes you? Socr. You, as I shall prove it: Mark the Panathenæa, where you cram Your belly full of pottage; if you shake And stir it lustily about—what then? Streps. Marry, why then it gives a desperate crack; It bounces like a thunderbolt, the pottage Keeps such a coil within me—At the first Pappax it cries—anon with double force, Papappax!—when at length Papapappax From forth my sounding entrails thund'ring bursts. Socr. Think then, if so your belly trumpets forth, How must the vasty vault of heaven resound, When the clouds crack with thunder. Streps. Let that pass, And tell me of the lightning, whose quick flash Burns us to cinders; that at least great Jove Keeps in reserve to launch at perjury. Socr. Dunce, dotard! were you born before the flood To talk of perjury, whilst Simon breathes, Lucretius has dilated this thought into two very fine passages, in his sixth book, v. 386.–v. 416. Theorus and Cleonymus, whilst they, Thrice-perjur'd villains, brave the lightning's stroke, And gaze the heav'ns unscorcht? Would these escape? Why, man, Jove's random fires strike his own fane, Strike Sunium's guiltless top, strike the dumb oak, Who never yet broke faith or falsely swore. Streps. It may be so, good sooth! You talk this well, But I would fain be taught the natural cause Of these appearances. Socr. Mark when the winds, In their free courses check'd, are pent and purs'd As 'twere within a bladder, stretching then And struggling for expansion, they burst forth With crack so fierce as sets the air on fire. Streps. The devil they do! why now the murder's out: So was I serv'd with a damn'd paunch, I broil'd On Jove's day last, just such a scurvy trick; Because forsooth, not dreaming of your thunder, I never thought to give the rascal vent, Bounce! goes the bag, and covers me all over With filth and ordure till my eyes struck fire. Chor. The envy of all Athens shalt thou be, Happy old man, who from our lips dost suck Into thine ears true wisdom, so thou art But wise to learn, and studious to retain What thou hast learnt, patient to bear the blows And buffets of hard fortune, to persist Doing or suffering, firmly to abide Hunger and cold, not craving where to dine, To drink, to sport and trifle time away, But holding that for best, which best becomes A man who means to carry all things through Neatly, expertly, perfect at all points With head, hands, tongue, to force his way to fortune. This speech, which, in the common editions, is given to Socrates, is very properly restored by Brunck to the chorus. Streps. Be confident; I give myself for one Of a tough heart, watchful as care can make me, A frugal, pinching fellow, that can sup Upon a sprig of savory and to bed; I am your man for this, hard as an anvil. Socr. 'Tis well, so you will ratify your faith In these our deities—chaos and Clouds And speech—to these and only these adhere. Streps. If from this hour henceforth I ever waste A single thought on any other gods, Or give them sacrifice, libation, incense, Nay, even common courtesy, renounce me. Chor. Speak your wish boldly then, so shall you prosper As you obey and worship us, and study The wholesome art of thriving. Streps. Gracious ladies, I ask no mighty favor, simply this— Let me but distance every tongue in Greece, And run 'em out of sight a hundred lengths. Chor. Is that all? there we are your friends to serve you: We will endow thee with such powers of speech, As henceforth not a demagogue in Athens Shall spout such popular harangues as thou shalt. Streps. A fig for powers of spouting! give me powers Of nonsuiting my creditors. Chor. A trifle— Granted as soon as ask'd; only be bold, And show yourself obedient to your teachers. Streps. With your help so I will, being undone, Stript of my pelf by these high-blooded cattle, And a fine dame, the torment of my life. Now let them work their wicked will upon me; Here some of the old editions make Socrates and the Chorus leave the stage, and throw the remainder of this speech into soliloquy. They're welcome to my carcase; let 'em claw it, Starve it with thirst and hunger, fry it, freeze it, Nay, flay the very skin off; 'tis their own; So that I may but fob my creditors, Let the world talk; I care not though it call me A bold-fac'd, loud-tongu'd, over-bearing bully; A shameless, vile, prevaricating cheat; A tricking, quibbling, double-dealing knave; A prating, pettyfogging limb o'th'law; A sly old fox, a perjurer, a hang-dog, A raggamuffin made of shreds and patches, The leavings of a dunghill—Let 'em rail, Yea, marry, let 'em turn my guts to fiddle-strings, May my bread be my poison! if I care. This torrent of terms, nearly if not quite synonymous, forms one of the most curious passages in this very singular author, and is such a specimen of the versatility and variety of the language, as almost defies translation. They are anapæsts in the original, and have been ignorantly thrown into soliloquy, which is property corrected in Brunck's edition, for which there is not only authority of the best MSS. but internal evidence of the strongest sort. I have struggled with the difficulty to the best of my power, and if the learned reader will take the trouble to compare my effort with the original, I flatter myself he will not think I have been unfaithful or unfortunate in the attempt. Chor. This fellow hath a prompt and daring spirit— Come hither, Sir; do you perceive and feel What great and glorious fame you shall acquire By this our schooling of you? Streps. What, I pray you! Chor. What but to live the envy of mankind Under our patronage? Streps. When shall I see Those halcyon days? Chor. Then shall your doors be throng'd With clients waiting for your coming forth, All eager to consult you, pressing all To catch a word from you, with abstracts, briefs, And cases ready-drawn for your opinion. But come, begin and lecture this old fellow; Sift him, that we may see what meal he's made of. Socr. Hark'ye, let's hear what principles you hold, That these being known, I may apply such tools As tally with your stuff. Streps. Tools! by the gods; Are you about to spring a mine upon me? Socr. Not so, but simply in the way of practice To try your memory. Streps. Oh! as for that, My memory is of two sorts, long and short: With them, who owe me aught, it never fails; My creditors indeed complain of it, As mainly apt to leak and lose its reck'ning. Socr. But let us hear if nature hath endow'd you With any grace of speaking. Streps. None of speaking, But a most apt propensity to cheating. Socr. If this be all, how can you hope to learn? Streps. Fear me not, never break your head for that. Socr. Well then, be quick, and when I speak of things Mysterious and profound, see that you make No boggling, but— Streps. I understand your meaning; You'd have me bolt philosophy by mouthfuls, Just like a hungry cur. He glances at the Cynic philosophers. Socr. Oh! brutal, gross, And barbarous ignorance! I must suspect, Old as thou art, thou must be taught with stripes: Tell me now, when thou art beaten, what dost feel? Streps. The blows of him that beats me I do feel; But having breath'd awhile I lay my action And cite my witnesses; anon more cool, I bring my cause into the court, and sue For damages. Socr. Strip off your cloak! prepare. Streps. Prepare for what? what crime have I committed? Socr. None; but the rule and custom is with us, That all shall enter naked. Streps. And why naked? I come with no search-warrant; fear me not; I'll carry naught away with me. Socr. No matter; Conform yourself, and strip. The humor of this, and every other dialogue between these characters, consists in the clown's continual misconstruction of the philosopher's meaning. The poet, who seems to hold all the superstitious ceremonies of the heathen religion in contempt, makes Socrates insist upon Strepsiades stripping himself naked before he can be admitted of his school, because such was the practice with those, who were initiated into the sacred mysteries. The clown, who does not see the drift of this injunction, excuses himself from obeying it, by saying, he does not come like those, who are sent upon the search for stolen goods, and who by law were obliged to enter all such houses naked, and so to go out of them, that their warrant might not be made a pretence for plundering the owners. Streps. And if I do, Tell me for my encouragement to which Of all your scholars will you liken me. Socr. You shall be call'd a second Chærephon. Streps. Ah! Chærephon is but another name For a dead corpse—excuse me. Socr. No more words: Pluck up your courage; answer not, but follow: Haste and be perfected. Streps. Give me my dole Strepsiades, though seemingly unconscious of the allusions to the sacred mysteries, is perfectly well versed in the ceremonials of Trophonius's cave, and asks for the honey-cake, which is an indispensible oblation to the prophetic dragon under ground. The circumstance of stripping naked applies equally to the candidate for admission to the cave, as well as to the mysteries, properly so called. Of honey-cake in hand, and pass me on; Ne'er trust me if I do not quake and tremble As if the cavern of Trophonius yawn'd, And I were stepping in. Socr. What ails you? enter! Why do you halt and loiter at the door? (Exeunt Socrates and Strepsiades.) Chor. Go, brave adventurer, proceed! May fortune crown the gallant deed; Tho' far advanc'd in life's last stage, Spurning the infirmities of age, Thou canst to youthful labors rise, And boldly struggle to be wise. Ye, who are here spectators of our scene, This address, it is presumed, was spoken by the Chorus on the part of the author, and probably by one wearing his mask. I think it is easy to understand his motives for the introduction of it here, whilst the action of the comedy is suspended, and in this stage of its progress rather than as a prologue before the opening of the play, when the minds of the audience might have been less favorably disposed to receive it. Depending upon the interest, which the preceding scenes would naturally create, he now ventures gently to expostulate with them upon the hard treatment his former comedy of the Clouds had met with, vindicating that performance, yet artfully charging its miscarriage upon a cabal, whose ignorance and injustice they had no share in. This is curious, as far as it gives us an insight into the mind and feelings of the poet, where we can at once discover a high sense and understanding of his own merit, and a keen resentment of the indignity he had suffered by what he calls a faction, from which however he exculpates his present audience, only because he fears to provoke them to a similar opposition, and finds it necessary to sooth them into good-humor, fully evincing by the compliments he pays them, how doubtfully he thought of his own situation, and of their disposition to support him in his present undertaking. Give me your patience to a few plain words, And by my patron Bacchus, whose I am, I swear they shall be true ones—Gentle friends, So may I prosper in your fair esteem, As I declare in truth that I was mov'd To tender you my former comedy, As deeming it the best of all my works, And you it's judges worthy of that work, Which I had wrought with my best care and pains: But fools were found to thrust me from the stage, And you, whose better wisdom should have sav'd me From that most vile cabal, permitted it; For which I needs must chide, yet not so sharply As to break off from such approv'd good friends: No, you have been my patrons from all time, Ev'n to my first-born issue: when I dropt My bantling at your door to hide the shame Of one, who call'd herself a maiden muse, You charitably took the foundling in, And gave it worthy training. Now, behold, This sister comedy, Electra-like, Comes on the search if she perchance may find Some recognition of her brother lost, Tho' but a relic of his well-known hair. Seemly and modest she appears before you; Not like our stage buffoons in shaggy hide To set the mob a roaring; she will vent No foolish jests at baldness, This is a retort upon Eupolis, who had taken occasion to ridicule Aristophanes for so poor a reason as his being bald-headed. I need not remind the reader that the Electra-like points at Æschylus. will not dance The sottish cordax; The cordax was a comic dance of a gross and indecent character, in which the performers counterfeited drunkenness. It became proverbial, and is alluded to by a variety of authors; see Meursius in Orchestra. we have no old man Arm'd with a staff to practise manual jokes On the by-standers' ribs, and keep the ring For them who dance the chorus: you shall see No howling furies Æschylus was mulct in a heavy fine for introducing his chorus of furies armed with fiery torches. burst upon the stage Waving their fiery torches; other weapons Than the muse gives us we shall not employ, Nor let ah me, ah me! He says (glancing at the hypochondriac philosophers) that he will not weary his audience with the mournful repetitions of ???, ???! Yet with these very words Strepsiades opens the very play we are upon. sigh in your ears. Yet not of this I boast, nor that I scorn To cater for your palates out of scraps At second or third hand, but fresh and fair And still original, as one, who knows When he has done a good deed where to stop, And having levell'd Cleo Cleo's death took place in the year following. to the ground, Not to insult his carcase, like to those Who having once run down Hyperbolus, Poor devil! mouth and mangle without mercy Him and his mother too; foremost of these Was Eupolis, who pilfer'd from my muse, And pass'd it for his own with a new name, Guilty the more for having dash'd his theft With the obscene device of an old hag Dancing the drunken cordax in her cups, Like her Phrynichus feign'd to be devour'd By the sea-monster—Shame upon such scenes! Hermippus next Hyperboliz'd amain, And now the whole pack open in full cry, Holding the game in chace, which I had rous'd. If there be any here, who laugh with these, It is curious, though not pleasing, to observe with what acrimony these contemporary wits pursue each other, and it is not unnatural to conclude, that wherever the practice shall obtain, as at Athens, of reviewing the dramatic productions of the year, and adjudging the prize of fame to one above all the rest, the consequences must ever be such, or nearly such, as we now contemplate. Those adjudications, we have authority to believe, were in many cases partial, or at least injudicious, and even at best they could not but be attended with murmurs and remonstrances, nor fail to aggravate the animosity and inflame the envious spirits of rival authors, high in their own conceit, and keenly jealous of each other's success. Let such not smile with me; but if this night Ye crown these scenes with merited applause, Posterity shall justify your taste. Semichorus. Great Jove, supreme of Gods, and heav'n's high king, First I invoke; next him the trident's lord, He follows the Homeric order in addressing Neptune next to Jupiter; and in his attributes seems to have the Prometheus of Æschylus in his eye. Whose mighty stroke smites the wild waves asunder, And makes the firm earth tremble; thee, from whom We draw our being, all-inspiring Air, Parent of nature; and thee, radiant Sun, Thron'd in thy flaming chariot, I invoke, Dear to the gods and by the world ador'd. Chorus of Clouds. Most grave and sapient judges, hear the charge, Which we shall now prefer, of slights ill brook'd By us your wrong'd appellants: for whilst we, The patronesses of your state, the Clouds, Of all the powers celestial serve you most, You graceless mortals serve us not at all; Nor smoke, nor sacrifice ascends from you, But blank ingratitude and cold neglect. If some rash enterprise you set on foot, Some brainless project, straight with rain or thunder, Sure warnings, we apprize you of your folly: When late you made that offspring of a tanner, That Paphlagonian odious to the gods, The general of your armies, mark how fierce We scowl'd upon you, and indignant roll'd Our thunders intermixt with flashing fires; The Moon forsook her course, and the vext Sun Quench'd his bright torch, disdaining to behold Cleo your chief, yet chief that Cleo was, For it should seem a proverb with your people, That measures badly taken best succeed: But if you'll learn of us the ready mode To cancel your past errors, and ensure Fame and good-fortune for the public weal, You have nought else to do, but stop the swallow In this period of the Greek comedy, these appeals to the theatre had a kind of Saturnalian privilege for personalities of the coarsest sort. It does not appear that Cleo's public character deserved these invectives, though his private one was far from amiable. The account of his public services will be found in Thucydides, lib. iv. and he died in battle; but Aristophanes bore him an inveterate grudge for opposing him in the matter of his naturalization. Of that wide-gaping cormorant, that thief Convicted and avow'd, with a neat noose Drawn tight and fitted to his scurvy throat. Semichorus. Thou too, Apollo, of thy native isle, Upon the Cinthian mount high thron'd, the king, Hear and be present! thou, Ephesian goddess, Whose golden shrine the Lydian damsels serve With rich and costly worship; thou, Minerva, Arm'd with the dreadful ægis, virgin queen, And patroness of Athens; thou, who hold'st Divided empire on Parnassus' heights, Lead hither thy gay train of revellers, Convivial god, and thus invok'd approach! Chorus. As we were hither journeying, in midway We crost upon the Moon, who for a while Held us in converse, and with courteous greeting To this assembly charg'd us—This premis'd, The tenor of our next instruction points To anger and complaint for ill returns On your part to good offices on her's. First, for the loan of her bright silver lamp So long held out to you, by which you've sav'd Your torch and lacquey for this many a night. More she could name, if benefits avail'd; But you have lost all reck'ning of your feasts, And turn'd your calendar quite topsey-turvey; So that the deities, who find themselves Bilk'd of their dues, and supperless for lack Of their accustom'd sacrifices, rail At her, poor Moon, and vent their hungry spite, As she were in the fault; whilst you, forsooth, Maliciously select our gala days, When feasting would be welcome, for your suits And criminal indictments; but when we When the poet, who is here speaking in his own person, indulges himself in such a vein of daring ridicule, it would be hard to suppose that he was seriously employed to fix the charge of impiety upon Socrates, for the purpose of bringing him to trial. That he was guiltless of this cruel intention, stronger internal evidence cannot be adduced than what this Chorus affords; and there must be a wondrous want of reverence for the gods amongst the people at large, or an unbounded privilege of lampooning them on the stage, when such passages as this could pass with impunity. As for the seemingly serious invocations of the Semichorus, them I regard as mere parodies upon the tragic poets, who carried them to excess; and it was only because Socrates was known to hold the licentiousness of the comic poets in contempt, that they were provoked to retort that contempt upon him and his doctrines. Keep fast and put on mourning for the loss Of Memnon or Sarpedon, sons of Heaven, Then, then you mock us with the savory odor Of smoking dainties, which we may not taste: Therefore it is, that when this year ye sent Your deputy Amphictyon to the diet, (Hyperbolus forsooth) in just revenge We tore away his crown, and drove him back To warn you how you slight the Moon again. Socrates, Strepsiades, Chorus. Socr. O vivifying breath, ethereal air, This is one of the passages where Aristophanes is charged with having paved the way for Anytus and Melitus in their attack upon Socrates; but referring to what we have repeatedly offered upon this subject, we leave it with the reader. The circumstance of the vermin, which annoy Strepsiades in his pallet, is ridicule of no very cleanly species, yet the affected poverty of habit, which many of the sophists put on, and their loathsome neglect of their persons, merited contempt and reproof. And thou profoundest chaos, witness for me If ever wretch was seen so gross and dull, So stupid and perplext as this old clown, Whose shallow intellect can entertain No image nor impression of a thought; But ere you've told it, it is lost and gone. 'Tis time however he should now come forth In the broad day—What hoa! Strepsiades— Take up your pallet; bring yourself and it Into the light. Streps. Yes, if the bugs would let me. Socr. Quick, quick, I say; set down your load and listen! Streps. Lo! here am I. Socr. Come, tell me what it is That you would learn besides what I have taught you; Is it of measure, verse, or modulation? Streps. Of measure by all means, for I was fobb'd Of two days' dole i'th'measure of my meal By a damn'd knavish huckster. Socr. Pish! who talks Of meal? I ask which metre you prefer, Tetrametre or trimetre. Streps. I answer— Give me a pint pot. There was a certain measure, as near as possible to our pint, which the Greeks dealt out daily of meal to their slaves. To this Strepsiades alludes when he says he was defrauded of two measures, and to this humorous mal-entendu he obstinately adheres through the whole scene, playing upon the pedantry of the philosopher by contrasting it with the rusticity of the clown, which, though difficult to translate into modern language, is surely a scene in the best style of the author. Socr. Yes, but that's no answer. Streps. No answer! stake your money, and I'll wager That your tetrametre is half my pint pot. Socr. Go to the gallows, clodpate, with your pint pot! Will nothing stick to you? But come, perhaps We may try further and fare better with you— Suppose I spoke to you of modulation; Will you be taught of that? Streps. Tell me first, Will I be profited? will I be paid The meal that I was chous'd of? tell me that. Socr. You will be profited by being taught To bear your part at table in some sort After a decent fashion; you will learn Which verse is most commensurate and fit To the arm'd chorus in the dance of war, And which with most harmonious cadence guides The dactyl in his course poetical. Streps. The dactyl, quotha! Sure I know that well. Socr. As how? discuss. Streps. Here, at my fingers' end; This is my dactyl, and has been my dactyl Since I could count my fingers. Socr. Oh! the dolt. Streps. I wish to be no wiser in these matters. This is an excellent answer on the part of common sense to all such unprofitable and pedantic trifling. It is not easy to conceive how the wit of man could devise means of exhibiting the character of a sophist in a more ludicrous light, than is done throughout the whole of this very extraordinary drama. Socr. What then? Streps. Why then, teach me no other art But the fine art of cozening. Socr. Granted; still There is some previous matter, as for instance The genders male and female If this same art of cozening was little else but that of quibbling upon words, the philosopher is not without reason made to lecture his pupil upon the genders of nouns; and as the meanest evasion language will admit of is that species of quibbling to which this lecture leads, severer ridicule could not be employed against the person it affects; whether it was well or ill founded we do not say, but, be that as it may, take it as a specimen of comic contrast, and perhaps no two characters were ever presented on the stage more humorously or more ingeniously opposed.—Can you name them? Streps. I were a fool else—These are masculine; Ram, bull, goat, dog, and pullet. Socr. There you're out: Pullet is male and female. Streps. Tell me how? Socr. Cock and hen pullet—So they should be nam'd. Streps. And so they should, by the ethereal air! You've hit it; for which rare discovery, Take all the meal this cardopus contains. Socr. Why there again you sin against the genders, To call your bolting-tub a cardopus, Making that masculine which should be fem'nine. Streps. How do I make my bolting-tub a male? Socr. Did you not call it cardopus? As well You might have call'd Cleonymus a man; He and your bolting-tub alike belong To t'other sex, believe me. Streps. Well, my trough Shall be a Cardopa and he Cleonyma; Will that content you? Socr. Yes, and while you live Learn to distinguish sex in proper names. Streps. I do; the female I am perfect in. Socr. Give me the proof. Streps. Lysilla, she's a female; Philinna, and Demetria, and Clitagora. Socr. Now name your males. Streps. A thousand—as for instance, Philoxenus, Melesias, and Amynias. Socr. Call you these masculine, egregious dunce? Streps. Are they not such with you? Socr. No; put the case, You and Amynias meet—how will you greet him? Streps. Why, thus for instance—Hip! holla! Aminia! Socr. There, there! you make a wench of him at once. Streps. And fit it is for one who shuns the field; This Amynias seems to have had his full share of abuse from the comic poets of his time: Eupolis, Crates, and our author, in various parts, bestow it very plentifully. A coward ought not to be call'd a man; Why teach me what is known to all the world? Socr. Aye, why indeed?—but come, repose yourself. Streps. Why so? Socr. For meditation's sake: lie down. Streps. Not on this lousy pallet I beseech you; But if I must lie down, let me repose On the bare earth and meditate. Socr. Away! There's nothing but this bed will cherish thought. Streps. It cherishes, alas! a host of bugs, That show no mercy on me. Socr. Come, begin, Cudgel your brains and turn yourself about; Now ruminate awhile, and if you start A thought that puzzles you, try t'other side And turn to something else, but not to sleep; Suffer not sleep to close your eyes one moment. Streps. Ah! woe is me; ah, woeful, well-a-day! Socr. What ails you? why this moaning? Streps. I am lost; I've rous'd the natives from their hiding holes; A colony of bugs in ambuscade Have fall'n upon me; belly, back, and ribs, No part is free: I feed a commonwealth. Socr. Take not your sufferings too much to heart. Streps. How can I chuse—a wretch made up of wants! Here am I penniless and spiritless, Without a skin, Heav'n knows, without a shoe; And to complete my miseries here I lie Like a starv'd centinel upon his post At watch and ward, till I am shrunk to nothing. Socr. How now; how fare you? Have you sprung a thought? Streps. Yes, yes, so help me Neptune! Socr. Hah! what is it? Streps. Why I am thinking if these cursed vermin Will leave one fragment of my carcase free. Socr. A plague confound you! Streps. Spare yourself that prayer; I'm plagu'd already to your heart's content. Socr. Prythee don't be so tender of your skin; Tuck yourself up and buff it like a man: Keep your scull under cover, and depend on't 'Twill make your brain bring forth some precious project For farthering your good-fortune at the expence Of little else but honesty and justice. Streps. Ah! would to Heav'n some friendly soul would help me To a fine project how to cheat the bugs With a sleek lambskin. Socr. Whereabouts, I trow, Sits the wind now? What ails you? are you dozing? Streps. Not I, by Heaven! Socr. Can you start nothing yet? Streps. Nothing, so help me. Socr. Will your head breed no project, Tho' nurs'd so daintily? Streps. What should it breed? Tell me, sweet Socrates; give me some hint. Socr. Say first what 'tis you wish. Streps. A thousand times, Ten thousand times I've said it o'er and o'er— My creditors, my creditors—'Tis them I would fain bilk. Socr. Go to! get under cover, Keep your head warm, and rarify your wits Till they shall sprout into some fine conceit, Some scheme of happy promise: sift it well, Divide, abstract, compound, and when 'tis ready, Out with it boldly. Streps. Miserable me! Would I were out! Socr. Lie still, This incident of the truckle bed, and all Socrates's instructions for soliciting the inspiration of some sudden thought, are a banter upon the pretended visions and communications with dæmons of the sophists and philosophers; tricks brought by them out of Egypt and the East, which served to impose upon the credulous and vulgar. and if you strike Upon a thought that baffles you, break off From that intanglement and try another, So shall your wits be fresh to start again. Streps. Hah! my dear boy!—My precious Socrates! Socr. What would'st thou, gaffer? Streps. I have sprung a thought, A plot upon my creditors. Socr. Discuss! Streps. Answer me this—Suppose that I should hire A witch, who some fair night shall raise a spell, Whereby I'll snap the moon from out her sphere And bag her Socr. What to do! Streps. To hold her fast, And never let her run her courses more; So shall I 'scape my creditors. Socr. How so? Streps. Because the calculations of their usury Are made from month to month. Socr. A gallant scheme; And yet methinks I could suggest a hint As practicable and no less ingenious— Suppose you are arrested for a debt, We'll say five talents, how will you contrive To cancel at a stroke both debt and writ? Streps. Gramercy! I can't tell you how off hand; It needs some cogitation. Socr. Were you apt, Such cogitations would not be to seek; They would be present at your fingers' ends, Buzzing alive, like chafers in a string, Ready to slip and fly. Streps. I've hit the nail That does the deed, and so you will confess. Socr. Out with it! Streps. Good chance but you have noted A pretty toy, a trinket in the shops, Which being rightly held produceth fire From things combustible— Socr. A burning glass, Vulgarly call'd— Streps. You are right; 'tis so. Socr. Proceed! Streps. Put the case now your whoreson bailiff comes, Shows me his writ—I, standing thus, d'ye mark me, In the sun's stream, measuring my distance, guide My focus to a point upon his writ, And off it goes in fume. Socr. By the Graces! 'Tis wittingly devis'd. Streps. The very thought Of his five talents cancel'd at a stroke Makes my heart dance for joy. Socr. But now again— Streps. What next? Socr. Suppose yourself at bar, surpriz'd Into a suit, no witnesses at hand, The judge prepar'd to pass decree against you— How will you parry that? Streps. As quick as thought— Socr. But how? Streps. Incontinently hang myself, And baulk the suitor— Socr. Come, you do but jest. Streps. Serious, by all the gods! A man that's dead Is out of the law's reach. Socr. I've done with you— Instruction's lost upon you; your vile jests Put me beyond all patience. Streps. Nay, but tell me What is it, my good fellow, that offends thee? Socr. Your execrable lack of memory. Why how now; what was the first rule I taught you? Streps. Say'st thou the first? the very first—what was it? Why, let me see; 'twas something, was it not? About the meal—Out on it! I have lost it. Socr. Oh thou incorrigible, old doating blockhead, Can hanging be too bad for thee! Streps. Why there now! Was ever man so us'd? If I can't make My tongue keep pace with your's, teach it the quirks And quibbles of your sophistry at once, I may go hang—I am a fool forsooth— Where shall I turn. Oh gracious Clouds, befriend me, This apostrophe to the Chorus, for which the old man is prepared by the reproaches of Socrates, is very artfully introduced. It not only gives them a timely interest in the scene, and breaks the long silence they had kept, but produces a new incident in the drama, on which the catastrophe is made to turn. It is also perfectly fit, that the thought of sending the son to Socrates in place of the father should be suggested by the Chorus, and not spring from either of the persons present on the scene. Give me some counsel. Chorus. This it is, old man— If that your son at home is apt and docile, Depute him in your stead, and send him hither. Streps. My son is well endow'd with nature's gifts, But obstinately bent against instruction. Chorus. And do you suffer it? Streps. What can I do? He's a fine full-grown youth, a dashing fellow, And by the mother's side of noble blood: I'll feel my way with him—but if he kicks, Befall what may, nothing shall hinder me But I will kick him headlong out of doors, And let him graze ev'n where he will for me— Wait only my return; I'll soon dispatch. [Exit. Chor. “Highly favor'd shalt thou be, “With gifts and graces kept in store “For those who our divinities adore, “And to no other altars bend the knee: “And well we know th'obedience shown “By this old clown deriv'd alone “From lessons taught by thee. “Wherefore to swell thy lawful gains, “Thou soon shalt skin this silly cur, “Whom thou hast put in such a stir, “And take his plunder for thy pains: “For mark how often dupes like him devise “Projects that only serve t'enrich the wise.” Such of the editions, as have arranged this comedy into acts, make the second to conclude in this place. The ridiculous lucubrations of Strepsiades in the philosopher's truckle-bed, with his scheme of the witch and the burning glass, which form the humor of the foregoing scene, had doubtless some temporary points of personality, which we are now at a loss to trace, further than in the project for arresting the moon, where he seems to glance at Pythagoras. The Clouds, in this comedy, are not merely those insipid, episodical personages, which only seem to interrupt and encumber the drama, but take an important part in the business of the scene, and put in motion the chief incidents of the plot. Strepsiades, Phidippides. Streps. Out of my house! I call the Clouds to witness You shall not set a foot within my doors. Go to your Lord Megacles! Get you hence, And gnaw his posts for hunger. Phidip. Ah, poor man! I see how it is with you. You are mad, Stark mad, by Jupiter! Streps. You swear by Jupiter! Why then I swear by Jove there's no such god— Now who is mad but you? Phidip. Why do you turn Such solemn truths to ridicule! Streps. I laugh To hear a child prate of such old men's fables; But list to what I'll tell you, learn of me, And from a child you shall become a man— But keep the secret close, do you mark me, close; Beware of babbling— Phidip. Heyday! what is coming? Streps. You swore but now by Jupiter— Phidip. I did. Streps. Mark now what 'tis to have a friend like me— I tell you at a word there is no Jupiter. Phidip. How then? Streps. He's off: I tell it you for truth; He's out of place, and Vortex reigns instead. Phidip. Vortex indeed! What freak has caught you now? Streps. No freak, 'tis fact. Phidip. Who tells you this? Streps. Who tells me? Who but that Melian atheist Socrates, He calls Socrates a Melian, insinuating that he is, like Diagoras of Melos, a professed despiser of the heathen Deities. When this very comedy furnishes so many passages in direct contempt of those Deities, the poet cannot be supposed to affix any great degree of criminality to his charge against him. The audience, that could endure the poet, might well excuse the philosopher. And Chærephon, the flea philosopher? Phidip. Are you so far gone in your dotage, sir, As to be dup'd by the profane opinions Of rancorous pedagogues? Streps. Keep a good tongue; Take heed you slander not such worthy men, So wise withal and learned, men so pure And cleanly in their morals, that no razor Ever profan'd their beards; their unwash'd hides Ne'er dabbled in a bath, nor wafted scent Of od'rous ungent as they pass'd along. But you, a prodigal fine spark, make waste And havoc of my means, as I were dead And out of thought—but come, turn in and learn. Phidip. What can I learn or profit from such teachers? Streps. Thou canst learn every thing that turns to profit; But first and foremost thou canst learn to know Thyself how totally unlearn'd thou art, How mere a blockhead and how dull of brain— But wait awhile with patience— [Exit. Phidip. Woe is me! How shall I deal with this old crazy father? What course pursue with one, whose reason wanders Out of all course? Shall I take out the statute And cite him for a lunatic, or wait Till nature and his phrenzy with the help Of the undertaker shall provide a cure? (Strepsiades returns.) Streps. Now we shall see! Lo! what have I got here? Phidip. A chicken— Streps. Well, and this? Phidip. A chicken also. Streps. Are they the same then? Have a care, good boy, How you expose yourself, and for the future Describe them cock and hen-chick severally. Phidip. Ridiculous! Is this the grand discovery You have just borrow'd from these sons o'th'dunghill? Streps. This, and a thousand others—but being old And lax of memory I lose it all As fast as it comes in. Phidip. Yes, and methinks By the same token you have lost your cloak. Streps. No, I've not lost it; I have laid it out Upon the arts and sciences. Phidip. Your shoes— They're vanish'd too. How have you laid them out? Streps. Upon the commonwealth—Like Pericles He alludes to the sums that Pericles had expended in bribing the Lacedæmonian ephori, Cleander and Plistianax. I'm a barefooted patriot—Now no more; Do as thou wilt, so thou wilt but conform And humor me this once, as in times past I humor'd thee, and in thy playful age Brought thee a penny go-cart from the fair, Purchas'd with what I had earn'd at the assize, The fee with my subpœna. Phidip. You'll repent, My life upon't; you will repent of this. Streps. No matter, so you'll humor me—What hoa! Why Socrates, I say, come forth, behold Here is my son; I've brought him, tho' in faith Sorely against the grain. (Socrates enters.) Socr. Aye, he's a novice, And knows not where the panniers hang as yet. Phidip. I would you'd hang yourself there in their stead! Streps. Oh monstrous impudence! this to your master! Socr. Mark how the ideot quibbles upon hanging, Driv'ling and making mouths—Can he be taught The loopholes of the law; whence to escape, How to evade and when to press a suit, Or tune his lips to that soft rhetoric, Which steals upon the ear, and melts to pity The heart of the stern judge? Streps. Come, never doubt him; He is a lad of parts, and from a child Took wondrously to dabbling in the mud, Whereof he'd build you up a house so natural As would amaze you, trace you out a ship, Make you a little cart out of the sole Of an old shoe mayhap, and from the rind Of a pomegranate cut you out a frog, You'd swear it was alive. Now what do you think? Hath he not wit enough to comprehend Each rule both right and wrong? Or if not both, The latter way at least—There he'll be perfect. The account here given by the old man of his son's early talents is perfectly in character, and extremely pleasant. It also prepares the audience for the introduction of the allegorical characters of the just and unjust man, that are about to enter on the scene. Socr. Let him prepare: His lecturers are ready. Streps. I will retire—When next we meet, remember I look to find him able to contend 'Gainst right and reason, and outwit them both. [Exit. (Dicæus It is generally supposed, that after the departure of Strepsiades, and before the just and unjust personages enter on the stage, the Chorus had a preparatory address in the original copy, which is now irretrievably lost. and Adicus enter. The interlude, which now ensues between these allegorical personages, contending for the possession of their pupil Phidippides, after the manner of the Choice of Hercules, forms a very curious passage in this celebrated comedy. It is in some parts very highly elevated, in others very pointedly severe. The object of the poet is to bring before his audience the question between past and present education into full and fair discussion, comparing the principles of the schools then existing with the pure and moral discipline of former times, and though the advocate for sophistry is allowed to triumph over the patron of reason in the event of this mock trial, yet the poet has contrived to elicit a juster verdict from the Chorus, than he is willing to credit the spectators for: and we must acknowledge it is not without cause that he is thus severe in his reproaches for their partiality to the reigning system, when we recollect that the magistracy of Athens had taken so strong a part with the philosophers against the stage, by silencing the comic writers to gratify the spleen of the Academies. To his own breast therefore, and to the breasts of the Chorus only, he appeals for justice, and obtains it; the rest he consigns to depravity of judgment and corruption of principle.) Dicæus. Come forth; turn out, thou bold audacious man, And face this company. Adicus. Most willingly: I do desire no better: take your ground Before this audience, I am sure to triumph. Dicæus. And who are you that vapor in this fashion? Adicus. Fashion itself—the very style of the times. Dicæus. Aye, of the modern times, and them and you I set at naught. Adicus. I shall bring down your pride. Dicæus. By what most witty weapon? Adicus. By the gift Of a most apt invention. Dicæus. Then I see You have your fools to back you. Adicus. No, the wise Are those I deal with. Dicæus. I shall spoil your market. Adicus. As how, good sooth? Dicæus. By speaking such plain truths As may appeal to justice. Adicus. What is justice? There's no such thing—I traverse your appeal. Dicæus. How! No such thing as justice? Adicus. No; where is it? Dicæus. With the immortal gods. Adicus. If it be there, How chanc'd it Jupiter himself escap'd These are strong words, and if the learned reader refers to the original, throughout the whole of these short speakings, I flatter myself he will credit me for as close an adherence to my author, as our respective languages will admit of. To the whole of this curious altercation I have given my best attention, as I doubt not but the poet himself did when he conceived it. A bolder sally of heathen blasphemy than this is no where upon classic record, and though he checks the speaker with a strong reproof, yet the risk of uttering it on the stage at all events, and the good reasons we have to presume the audience passed it off with impunity, is at least a proof that the friends of Jupiter were not very zealous to revenge his affronts. For his unnatural deeds to his own father? Dicæus. For shame, irreverent wretch, thus do you talk? I sicken at impiety so gross, My stomach kicks against it. Adicus. You are craz'd; Your wits, old gentleman, are off the hinges. Dicæus. You are a vile blasphemer and buffoon. Adicus. Go on! you pelt me—but it is with roses. Dicæus. A scoffer! Adicus. Every word your malice vents Weaves a fresh wreath of triumph for my brows. Dicæus. A parricide! Adicus. Proceed, and spare me not— You shower down gold upon me. Dicæus. Lead, not gold, Had been your retribution in times past. Adicus. Aye, but times present cover me with glory. Dicæus. You are too wicked. Adicus. You are much too weak. Dicæus. Thank your own self, if our Athenian fathers Coop up their sons at home, and fear to trust them Within your schools, conscious that nothing else But vice and folly can be learnt of you. Adicus. Methinks, friend, your's is but a ragged trade. Dicæus. And your's, oh shame! a thriving one, tho' late, A perfect Telephus, This is not the only passage in Aristophanes, nor is he the only comic poet who satirises Euripides for his character of Telephus, charging him with having exhibited a spectacle too beggarly and disgusting to be suffered on the tragic stage. How the delicacy of an Athenian audience might resent that spectacle, is no question of criticism at the present moment; certain it is, that the language of Telephus has not degraded the stage, but has graces that might have atoned for the indecorum of his exterior, if in fact there was any. What the poet adds with respect to the contents of his beggar's wallet, which in place of crusts and fragments of food he furnishes with what he calls Pandeletian scraps or sentences, this is figuratively said in allusion to his malignity, Pandeletus being notorious to a proverb for his malignant and litigious character, and accordingly held up to ridicule by the comic poets, particularly by Cratinus in his play of The Centaurs: the sense of this passage, therefore, which, in some copies is greatly corrupted, is, that he was as squalid as Telephus in his person, and as malicious as Pandeletus in his nature. you tramp'd the street With beggar's wallet cramm'd with hungry scraps Of Pandeletus—pettifogging fare. Adicus. Oh! what rare wisdom you remind me of! Dicæus. Oh, what rank folly their's, who rule this city, And let it nourish such a pest as you, To sap the morals of the rising age. Adicus. You'll not inspire your pupil with these notions, Old hoary-headed time! Dicæus. I will inspire him, If he has grace, to shun the malady Of your eternal clack. Adicus. Turn to me, youth! And let him rail at leisure. Dicæus. Keep your distance, And lay your hands upon him at your peril. Chor. Come, no more wrangling.—Let us hear you both; You of the former time produce your rules Of ancient discipline—of modern, you— That so, both weigh'd, the candidate may judge Who offers fairest, and make choice between you. Dicæus. I close with the proposal. Adicus. 'Tis agreed. Chor. But which of you shall open? Adicus. That shall he: I yield him up that point, and in reply, My words like arrows levelled at a but Shall pierce him through and through; then, if he rallies, If he comes on again with a rejoinder, I'll launch a swarm of syllogisms at him, That, like a nest of hornets, shall belabor him, Till they have left him not an eye to see with. Chor. “Now, sirs, exert your utmost care “And gravely for the charge prepare, “The well-rang'd hoard of thought explore, “Where sage experience keeps her store; “All the resources of the mind “Employment in this cause will find, “And he, who gives the best display “Of argument, shall win the day: “Wisdom this hour at issue stands, “And gives her fate into your hands; “Your's is a question that divides “And draws out friends on different sides; “Therefore on you, who, with such zealous praise, “Applaud the discipline of former days, “On you I call; now is your time to show “You merit no less praise than you bestow.” Dicæus. Thus summon'd, I prepare myself to speak Of manners primitive, and that good time, Which I have seen, when discipline prevail'd, And modesty was sanctioned by the laws. No babbling then was suffer'd in our schools, The scholar's test was silence. The whole group In orderly procession sallied forth Right onwards, without straggling, to attend Their teacher in harmonies; though the snow Fell on them thick as meal, the hardy brood Breasted the storm uncloak'd: their harps were strung Not to ignoble strains, for they were taught A loftier key, whether to chant the name Of Pallas, terrible amidst the blaze Of cities overthrown, or wide and far To spread, as custom was, the echoing peal. There let no low buffoon intrude his tricks, Let no capricious quavering on a note, No running of divisions high and low Break the pure stream of harmony, no Phrynis Phrynis of Mitylene, the scholar of Aristoclydes, is frequently alluded to by the comic poets for having introduced a new species of modulation in music, deviating from the simplicity of the ancient harmony. When Callias was archon, Phrynis bore away the prize for minstrelsy at the Panathenæa. Practising wanton warblings out of place— Woe to his back that so was found offending! Hard stripes and heavy would reform his taste. Decent and chaste their postures in the school Of their gymnastic exercises; none Expos'd an attitude that might provoke Irregular desire; their lips ne'er mov'd In love-inspiring whispers, and their walks From eyes obscene were sacred and secure. Hot herbs, the old man's diet, were proscrib'd; No radish, anice, parsley, deck'd their board; No rioting, no revelling was there At feast or frolic, no unseemly touch Or signal, that inspires the hint impure. Adicus. Why these are maxims obsolete and stale; Worm-eaten rules, coeval with the hymns Of old Cecydas and Buphonian feasts. Cecydas, a dithyrambic poet of very early times: Cratinus mentions him in his Panoptæ. The Buphonian festival, so called from the sacrifice of the ox, was a very ancient establishment. Dicæus. Yet so were train'd the heroes, that imbru'd The field of Marathon with hostile blood; This discipline it was that brac'd their nerves And fitted them for conquest. You, forsooth, At great Minerva's festival produce Your martial dancers, not as they were wont, But smother'd underneath a tawdry load Of cumbrous armor, till I sweat to see them Dangling their shields in such unseemly sort As mars the sacred measure of the dance. Be wise, therefore, young man, and turn to me, Turn to the better guide, so shall you learn To scorn the noisy forum, shun the bath, And turn with blushes from the scene impure: Then conscious innocence shall make you bold To spurn the injurious, but to reverend age Meek and submissive, rising from your seat To pay the homage due, nor shall you ever Or wring the parent's soul, or stain your own. In purity of manners you shall live A bright example; vain shall be the lures Of the stage-wanton floating in the dance, Vain all her arts to snare you in her arms, And strip you of your virtue and good name. No petulant reply shall you oppose To fatherly commands, nor taunting vent Irreverent mockery on his hoary head, Crying—“Behold Iapetus himself!” Poor thanks for all his fond parental care. Adicus. Aye, my brave youth, do, follow these fine rules, And learn by them to be as mere a swine, Driveler, and dolt, as any of the sons Of poor Hippocrates; Telesippus, Demophon, and Pericles, were sons of Hippocrates, proverbial for their stupidity. I swear by Bacchus, Folly and foul contempt shall be your doom. Dicæus. Not so, but fair and fresh in youthful bloom Amongst our young athletics you shall shine; Not in the forum loit'ring time away In gossip prattle, like our gang of idlers, Nor yet in some vexatious paltry suit Wrangling and quibbling in our petty courts, But in the solemn academic grove, Crown'd with the modest reed, fit converse hold With your collegiate equals; there serene, Calm as the scene around you, underneath The fragrant foliage where the ilex spreads, Where the deciduous poplar strews her leaves, Where the tall elm-tree and wide-stretching plane Sigh to the fanning breeze, you shall inhale Sweet odors wafted in the breath of spring. This is the regimen that will insure A healthful body and a vigorous mind, A countenance serene, expanded chest, Heroic stature and a temperate tongue; But take these modern masters, and behold These blessings all revers'd; a pallid cheek, Shrunk shoulders, chest contracted, sapless limbs, A tongue that never rests, and mind debas'd, By their vile sophistry perversely taught To call good evil, evil good, and be That thing, which nature spurns at, that disease, A mere Antimachus, Of this Antimachus I collect nothing more, than that he was generally marked with contempt for his effeminacy and profligacy. the sink of vice. Chor. “Oh sage instructor, how sublime “These maxims of the former time! “How sweet this unpolluted stream “Of eloquence, how pure the theme! “Thrice happy they, whose lot was cast “Amongst the generation past, “When virtuous morals were display'd “And these grave institutes obey'd. “Now you, that vaunt yourself so high, “Prepare; we wait for your reply, “And recollect, or ere you start, “You take in hand no easy part; “Well hath he spoke, and reasons good “By better only are withstood; “Sharpen your wits then, or you'll meet “Contempt as certain as defeat.” The poet having concluded his discussion of the ancient discipline, in a very eloquent harangue (though perhaps out of place according to the rules of comedy, and somewhat of the longest) and being conscious of having given all the argument to the advocate for times past, contrives, through the vehicle of the Chorus, to point out to the audience how their consciences ought, in moral justice, to decide. It is in this scene only, that his attack upon the sophists is of a grave and solemn cast, in every other instance he combats them with the weapons of ridicule, for which the character of Strepsiades is most ingeniously contrived, and though he makes the worse reasoner triumph over the better, and bear away his pupil from him, yet it is a triumph gained by such low and despicable quibbles, such palpable and bare-faced sophistry, that the success of the event is at once the severest satire he can vent upon the conqueror and his cause. Adicus. Doubt not I'm ready, full up to the throat And well nigh chok'd with plethory of words, Impatient to discharge them. I do know The mighty masters of the modern school Term me the lower logic, so distinguish'd From the old practice of the upper time, By him personified; which name of honor I gain'd as the projector of that method, Which can confute and puzzle all the courts Of law and jsutice—An invention worth Thousands to them who practise it, whereas It nonsuits all opponents.—Let that pass. Now take a sample of it in the ease, With which I'll baffle this old vaunting pedant With his warm baths, that he forsooth forbids. Harkye, old man, discuss, if so it please you, Your excellent good reason for this rule, That interdicts warm bathing. Dicæus. Simply this— I hold it a relaxer, rendering men Effeminate and feeble. Adicus. Hold awhile— I have you on the hook. Answer me this— Of all the heroes Jupiter has father'd, Which is for strength, for courage, and a course Of labors, most renown'd? Dicæus. I know none Superior in those qualities to Hercules. Adicus. And who e'er heard Herculean Tepid baths, according to fabulous legends, being the gift of Vulcan to Hercules, it became a fashion to term all such Herculean. baths were cold? Yet Hercules himself you own was strong. Dicæus. Aye, this is in the very style of the times; These are the dialectics now in fashion With our young sophists, who frequent the baths Whilst the palæstra starves. Adicus. I grant you this; It is the style of the times, by you condemn'd, By me approv'd, and not without good cause; For how but thus doth ancient Nestor talk? Can Homer err? Were all his wise men fools? They are my witnesses.—Now for this tongue, This member out of use by his decree, Not so by mine.—His scholar must be silent And chaste withal—damping prescriptions both— For what good fortune ever did betide The mute and modest? Instance me a case. Dicæus. Many—Chaste Peleus Peleus, having withstood the solicitations of Atalante, wife of Acastus, was rewarded for his continence by the gods, with a sword of celestial temper, the workmanship of Vulcan. But Atalante, having accused him to her husband, and stimulated Acastus to revenge a supposed attempt upon her honor, Peleus found himself driven to declare war against him, and to this Adicus alludes in his retort upon Dicæus. so obtain'd his sword. Adicus. His sword! and what did Peleus gain by that? Battle and blows this modest Peleus gain'd, Whilst mean Hyperbolus, whose wretched craft Was lamp-making, by craft of viler sort Garbel'd his thousands, solid coin, not swords. Dicæus. But continence befriended Peleus so As won the goddess Thetis to his bed. Adicus. And drove her out of it—for he was cold, Languid and listless: she was brisk and stirring, And sought the sport elsewhere. Now are you answer'd? Good sooth you're in your dotage. Mark, young sir, These are the fruits of continence: you see What pleasure you must forfeit to preserve it— All the delights that woman can bestow; No am'rous sports to catch the fair one's smile, No luscious dainties shall you then partake, No gay convivial revels, where the glass With peals of laughter circulates around; These you must sacrifice, and without these What is your life?—So much for your delights.— Now let us see how stands your score with nature— You're in some scrape we'll say—intrigue—adultery— You're caught, convicted, crush'd—for what can save you? You have no powers of speech—but arm'd by me You're up to all occasions: Nothing fear, Ev'n give your genius scope; laugh, frolic, sport, And flout at shame; for should the wittol spouse Detect you in the fact, you shall so pose him In his appeal, that nothing shall stick to you, For Jove shall take the blame from off your shoulders, Being himself a cuckold-making god, And you a poor frail mortal—Why should you Be wiser, stronger, purer than a god? Dicæus. But what if this your scholar should incur The catamite's correction, pill'd and sanded And garnish'd with a radish in his crupper, The scoff of all beholders—What fine quirk Will clear him at that pinch, but he must pass For a most perfect Ganimede? Adicus. What then? Where is the harm? Dicæus. Can greater harm befal him? Adicus. What will you say if here I can confute you? Dicæus. Nothing—my silence shall confess your triumph. Adicus. Come on then, answer me to what I ask. Our advocates—what are they? Dicæus. Catamites. Adicus. Our tragic poets—what are they? Dicæus. The same. Adicus. Good, very good!—our demagogues— Dicæus. No better. Adicus. See there! discern you not that you are foil'd? Cast your eyes round this company.— Dicæus. I do. Adicus. And what do you discover? Dicæus. Numerous birds Of the same filthy feather, so Heaven help me! This man I mark; and this, and this fine fop With his coil'd locks.—To all these I can swear. Adicus. What say you then? Dicæus. I say I am confuted— Here, wagtails, catch my cloak—I'll be amongst you. Here ends this famous episode, reversing the Choice of Hercules, and making the spectators parties in the criminality and injustice of the decision. This short speech has been given in some copies to Phidippides, but it properly belongs to Dicæus, whose action of throwing off his cloak alludes to Socrates's ceremony of stripping his disciples before they were initiated into his school. Socr. Now, friend, what say you? who shall school your son? Streps. School him and scourge him, take him to yourself. And mind you whet him to an edge on both sides, This for slight skirmish, that for stronger work. Socr. Doubt not, we'll finish him to your content A perfect sophist. Phidip. Perfect skin and bone— That I can well believe. Socr. No more—Away! Phidip. Trust me you've made a rod for your own back. (Manet Chorus.) Now to our candid judges we shall tell What recompence they may expect from us, If they indeed are studious to deserve it: First, on your new-sown grounds in kindly showers, Postponing other calls, we will descend. The bearing branches of your vines shall sprout, Nor scorch'd with summer heats nor chill'd with rain. This to our friends who serve us, but to him, Who dares to slight us, let that mortal hear, And tremble at the vengeance which awaits him: Nor wine nor oil shall that man's farm produce; For when his olive trees should yield their fruit, And his ripe vineyard tempts the gath'rer's hand, We'll batter him to ruin, lay him bare; And if we catch him with his roof until'd, Heav'ns! how we'll drench him with a pelting storm Of hail and rain incessant; above all, Let him beware upon the wedding night; When he brings home his own or kinsman's bride, Let him look to't! Then we'll come down in torrents, That he shall rather take his chance in Egypt, Than stand the vengeful soaking we will give him. (Strepsiades alone.) Lo! here's the fifth day gone—the fourth—the third— The second too—day of all days to me Most hateful and accurs'd—the dreadful eve, Ushering the new moon, that lets in the tide Of happy creditors, all sworn against me, To rack and ruin me beyond redemption. I like a courteous debtor, who would fain Soften their flinty bosoms, thus accost them— “Ah my good sir, this payment comes upon me “At a bad time, excuse me—That bill's due, “But you'll extend the grace—This you will cancel, “And totally acquit me.”—By no means; All with one voice cry out, they will be paid, And I must be be-knav'd into the bargain, And threaten'd with a writ to mend the matter— Well, let it come!—They may ev'n do their worst; I care not so my son hath learnt the trick Of this new rhetoric, as will appear When I have beat this door—Boy, boy! come forth! (Socrates comes forth.) Socr. Hail to Strepsiades! Streps. Thrice hail to Socrates! But first I pray you take this dole of meal In token of the reverence I bear you; And now, so please you, tell me of my son, Your late noviciate. Comes he on apace? Socr. He apprehends acutely. Streps. Oh brave news! Oh the transcendent excellence of fraud! Socr. Yes, you may set your creditors at naught— Streps. And their avouchers too?— Socr. Had they a thousand. Streps. Then I'll sing out my song, and sing aloud, And it shall be—Woe, woe to all your gang, Ye money-jobbing caitiffs, usurers, sharks! Hence with your registers, your cents-per-cent; I fear you not; ye cannot hook me now. Oh! such a son have I in training for you, Arm'd with a two-edg'd tongue that cuts o'both sides, The stay, support and pillar of my house, The scourge of my tormentors, the redeemer Of a most wretched father—Call him forth, Call him, I say, and let my eyes feast on him— What hoa! My son, my boy—Your father calls; Come forth and show yourself. (Phidippides enters.) Socr. Behold him present! Streps. My dear—my darling— Socr. Lo! you have your darling. Streps. Joy, joy, my son! all joy—for now you wear A face of the right character and cast, A wrangling, quibbling, contradicting face; Now you have got it neatly on your tongue— The very quirk o'th'time—“What's that you say? “What is it?”—Shifting from yourself the wrong To him that suffers it—an arch conceit To make a transfer of iniquity, When it has serv'd your turn—Yes, you will pass; You've the right Attic stamp upon your forehead. Now let me see a sample of your service, Forsooth to say you owe me a good turn. Phidip. What vexes you, my father? Streps. What! the moon, This day both new and old. Phidip. Both in one day? Ridiculous! Streps. No matter—'Tis the day Will bring my creditors upon my back All in a swarm together. Phidip. Let them swarm! We'll smother 'em if they dare so to miscal One day as two days. Streps. What should hinder them? Phidip. What, do you ask? Can the same woman be Both young and old at once? Streps. They speak by law: The statute bears them out. Phidip. But they misconstrue The spirit of the statute. Streps. What is that? Phidip. Time-honor'd Solon was the people's friend— Streps. This makes not to the case of new or old. Phidip. And he appointed two days for the process, The old and new day—for citation that, This for discharge— Streps. Why did he name two days? Phidip. Why, but that one might warn men of their debts, The other serve them to escape the payment; Else were they laid by th'heels as sure as fate On the new moon ensuing. Streps. Wherefore then Upon the former day do they commence Their doles and first fruits at the Prytaneum, And not at the new moon? Phidip. Because, forsooth, They're hungry feeders, and make haste to thrust Their greedy fingers in the public dish. Streps. Hence then, ye witless creditors, begone! We are the wise ones, we are the true sort; Ye are but blocks, mob, cattle, empty casks— “Therefore with ecstasy I'll raise “My jocund voice in fortune's praise, “And oh rare son!—Oh happy me! “The burden of my song shall be; “For hark! each passing neighbour cries— “All hail, Strepsiades the wise! “Across the forum as I walk, “I and my son the public talk, “All striving which shall have to boast “He prais'd me first, or prais'd me most— “And now, my son, my welcome guest, “Enter my house and grace my feast.” [Exeunt. (Pasias and a Witness.) Pasias. Should this man be permitted to go on At such a desperate rate? It must not be. Better for him to have brok'n up at once Than to be thus beset. Therefore it is That I am forc'd upon this hostile course, Empowering you to summon this my debtor For the recovery of my own—Good sooth, I will not put my country to the blush, But I must rouse Strepsiades— (Strepsiades re-enters.) Streps. Who's this? Pasias. The old and new day calls upon you, sir. Streps. Bear witness that this man has nam'd two days— And for what debt do you assail me thus? Pasias. For twelve good pounds that you took up at interest To pay for your son's racer. Streps. I a racer? Do you not hear him? Can you not all witness How mortally and from my soul I hate All the whole racing calendar? Pasias. What then? You took the gods to witness you would pay me. Streps. I grant you, in my folly I did swear, But then my son had not attain'd the art Of the new logic unconfutable. Pasias. And have you now the face to stand it out Against all evidence? Streps. Assuredly— Else how am I the better for my schooling? Pasias. And dare you, knowing it to be a falsehood, Take the great gods to witness to your oath, When I shall put it to you? Streps. What great gods? Pasias. Mercurius, Neptune, Jupiter himself— Streps. Yes, and stake down three-farthings as a handsel That I will take the oath, so help me Jove! Pasias. Insolent wretch, you'll perish in your folly, Streps. Oh! that this madman was well scrubb'd with salt To save his brains from addling! Pasias. Out upon't! Do you make game of me? Streps. —I warrant me He'll take at least six gallons for a dressing. Pasias. So may great Jove and all the gods deal with me As I will handle you for this buffoonery? Streps. I thank you for your gods—They're pleasant fellows— And for your Jupiter, the learn'd and wise Hold him a very silly thing to swear by. The exultation of Strepsiades upon receiving his son out of the hands of Socrates, the confidence with which he now faces creditors, of late so much dreaded, and the daring contempt he avows for Jupiter and the gods, are given with great comic spirit, and in the boldest strain of satire, through the whole of this and the preceding scenes. The pretences he sets up for parrying the lawful demands of his creditors are so strictly deducible from the lectures he had received from the philosopher, that every thing either said or done by father and son is by the cunning of the poet contrived to spring so pointedly and precisely from the dictates of their master, that nothing is allowed to escape, for which he is not made responsible, whilst the school of Socrates is held up to the audience as the source of every species of fraud, injustice, and impiety; and all this is done with a subtlety, that only makes the aim more certain and the stroke more severe. Pasias. 'Tis well, rash man, 'tis well! The time will come When you shall wish these vaunting words unsaid, But will you pay the debt or will you not? Say, and dismiss me. Streps. Set your mind at rest; You shall have satisfaction in a twinkling— (Steps aside.) Pasias. What think you of this chap? Witness. That he will pay you. (Strepsiades returns.) Streps. Where is this dun of mine? Come hither, friend, How do you call this thing? Pasias. A kneading trough, Or as we say, a cardopus— Streps. Go to! Dost think I'll pay my money to a blockhead, That calls this kneading-trough a cardopus? I tell you, man, it is a cardopa— Go, go, you will not get a doit from me, You and your cardopus. Pasias. Will you not pay me? Streps. Assure yourself I will not—Hence, begone! Will you not beat your march, and quit my doors? Pasias. I'm gone, but take this with you, if I live I'll sue you in the Prytaneum before night. Streps. You'll lose your suit, and your twelve pounds besides. I'm sorry for your loss, but who can help it? You may ev'n thank your cardopus for that. [Exit Pasias and Witness. (Amynias enters followed by a Witness.) Amynias. Ah me, ah me! Streps. Who's that with his—Ah me? Whom has Carcinus He glances at Carcinus, a very voluminous tragic writer, to the amount of 160 dramas. He introduced some of the immortals in ridiculous situations, using the like doleful expressions as he puts here in the mouth of the money lender. sent amongst us now— Which of his doleful deities?— Amynias. Alas! Would you know who I am? Know then I am A wretch made up of woes— Streps. A woeful wretch— Granted! pass on. Amynias. Oh inauspicious chance! Oh ye hard hearted, chariot breaking fates! Oh! Pallas my destroyer, what a crash Is this that you have giv'n me! Streps. Hah! what ails you? Of what can you accuse Tlepolemus? This is a parody upon some passage in one Carcinus's tragedies, or of his son Xenocles, in which Tlepolemus was probably the hero of the fable. Amynias. Mock not my miseries, but bid your son Repay what he has borrow'd. Streps. Take me with you— What should my son repay? Amynias. The sum I lent him. Streps. Is that it? Then your case is desperate; Truly you're out of luck. Amynias. I'm out of every thing— I overthrew my chariot—By the gods That's being out, I take it, with a vengeance. Streps. Say rather you are kick'd by an ass There is a play upon words in the original, which is not possible to transfuse into the translation. Then learned reader will understand the difficulty.—a trifle! Amynias. But, sir, my lawful money is no trifle; I shall not chuse to be kick'd out of that. Streps. I'll tell you what you are—Out of your wits. Amynias. How so? Streps. Because your brain seems wondrous leaky. Amynias. Look to't! By Mercury, I'll clap you up If you don't pay me. Streps. Hark'ye, one short question— When Jove rains on us does he rain fresh water, Or only vapors that the sun exhales? Answer me that. Amynias. I care not what he rains; I trouble not my cap with such conceits. Streps. And do you think a man, that has no wit To argue these rare points, will argue me Out of my money? Amynias. Let your debt go on, And pay me up the interest. Streps. What is that? What kind of thing is that same interest? Amynias. A thing it is that grows from day to day, And month to month, swelling as time rolls on To a round sum of money. Streps. Well defin'd! One question more—What think you of the sea? Is it not fuller now than heretofore? Amynias. No, by the Gods! not fuller, but as full: That is my judgment of it. Streps. Oh thou miser! That so would'st stint the ocean, and yet cram Thy swelling coffers till they overflow— Fetch me a whip, that I may lash him hence: Take to your heels—begone! Amynias. I will convoke My witnesses against you. Streps. Start! set off!— Do you take rest?—away! Amynias. Is not this outrage? Streps. Will you not bolt; will you not buckle kindly Into your geers, or must I mount and goad you Under the crupper, till you kick and wince For very madness? Oho! Are you off? A welcome riddance—All the devils drive You and your cursed chariot hence together. [Exeunt. Manet Chorus. “Mark here how rarely it succeeds “To build our trust on guilty deeds: “Mark how this old cajoling elf, “Who sets a trap to catch himself, “Falsely believes he has found the way “To hold his creditors at bay. “Too late he'll curse the sophists' school, “That taught his son to cheat by rule, “And train'd the modest lips of youth “In the vile art of torturing truth; “A modern logic much in use, “Invented for the law's abuse; “A subtle knack of spying flaws “To cast in doubt the clearest cause, “Whereby, in honesty's despite, “The wrong side triumphs o'er the right— “Alas! short triumph he must have, “Who glories that his son's a knave: “Ah foolish sire, the time will come The moral and prophetic Chorus again denounces punishment and repentance upon the infamous expedients which this old fellow has resorted to for defrauding his creditors, and the succeeding incident fully verifies the prediction. I am fully persuaded there is no Greek drama now in our hands, where the Chorus takes a part so intimately connected with the plot, as in this comedy: here it is essential, and delivers those sentiments, which reason dictates, and the poet wishes to inspire into the minds of his hearers— Oh! si sic semper dixisset! “You'll wish that son of your's were dumb.” Strepsiades, Phidippides, Chorus. Streps. Hoa there! What hoa! for pity's sake some help! Friends, kinsmen, countrymen! turn out and help! Oh! my poor head, my cheeks are bruis'd to jelly— Help by all means!—Why, thou ungracious cub, Thy father wouldst thou beat? Phidip. Assuredly. Streps. There, there! He owns that he would beat his father. Phidip. I own it, good my father! Streps. Parricide! Impious assassin! Sacrilegious wretch! Phidip. All, all, and more—You cannot please me better; I glory in these attributes. Go on! Streps. Monster of turpitude! Phidip. Crown me with roses! Streps. Wretch, will you strike your parent? Phidip. Piously, And will maintain the right, by which I do it. Streps. Oh shameless villain! can there be a right Against all nature so to treat a father? Phidip. That I shall soon make clear to your conviction. Streps. You, you convince me? Phidip. With the greatest ease: And I can work the proof two several ways; Therefore make choice between them. Streps. What do you mean? Phidip. I mean to say we argue up or down— Take which you like. It comes to the same end. Streps. Aye, and a precious end you've brought it to, If all my care of you must end in this, That I have put you in the way to beat me, (Which is a thing unnatural and profane) And after justify it. It is not easy to conceive any incident more pointedly severe than this, which the poet has employed for interesting the spectators in his attack upon the sophists. A son exhibited in the impious act of striking his father, and justifying the crime upon principle, is surely as bitter an invective against the schools of the philosophers as can be devised. Phidip. That I'll do By process clear and categorical, That you shall fairly own yourself a convert To a most wholesome cudgelling. Streps. Come on! Give me your arguments—but spare your blows. Chorus. How to restrain this headstrong son of yours Behoves you now, old man, to find the means, For sure he could not be thus confident Without some cause; something there needs must be, Some strong possession of himself within, That buoys him up to this high pitch of daring, This bold assumption; which that we may know, Give us distinctively the whole detail From first to last whence this contention sprang, So shall we hear, and hearing judge betwixt you. The interposition of the Chorus in this place is peculiarly apposite, in as much as it draws out the relation of what had passed between the father and son, which neither of them could else have given, and which it is, however, important for the audience to hear. Streps. So please you then I will the cause unfold Of this base treatment to your patient ears, And thus it stands—When we had supp'd together, As you all know, in friendly sort, I bade him Take up his lute and give me the good song Of old Simonides, Some popular ballad of Simonides, the lyric poet, of which I can discover no other record. who shear'd his ram; But he directly scouted my request— It was a fashion out of date forsooth— He would not sit twanging the lute, not he; 'Twas not for him to cackle o'er his wine, As if he were some wench working the hand-mill The women, whilst at work upon the hand-mill, were in the custom of cheering their labor with a song, and these ballads were thence called ????????? ????.— 'Twas vulgar and unseemly— Phidip. Grossly so; And was it not high time that I should beat you, Who had no better manners than to set Your guest a chirping like a grasshopper? Streps. These were his very words, and more than these; For by and bye he told me that Simonides Was a most paltry poet. This you'll own Was a tough morsel, yet I gulp'd it down, And pass'd it off with bidding him recite Some passage out of Æschylus, withal Tendering a myrtle wreath, as custom is, To grace the recitation—He forsooth, Flouting my tender, instantly replied— “I hold your Æschylus, of all our poets, “First of the spouters, incoherent, harsh, “Precipitous and turgid.”—Oh my friends, Was not this more than flesh and blood should bear? Yet, yet I smother'd rage within my heart And calmly said—“Call something else to mind “More to your taste and from some modern bard, “So it be good withal and worth the hearing—” Whereat, would you believe it? he began Repeating from Euripides—Great Jove, Guard my chaste ears from such another dose! A perilous long-winded tale of incest 'Twixt son and daughter of the same sad mother. Euripides formed a tragedy on the story of Macareus the son of Æolus, who violated his uterine sister Canace, for which crime he was put to death by his father. To this drama Ovid alludes in his Tr. 11. 384.— Nobilis est Canace fratris amore sui. (Brunck.) Sick to the soul I spurn'd at such declaiming, Adding, as well I might, all that my scorn Of such vile trash could add; till, to be short, Words begat words, and blows too as it prov'd, For leaping from his seat he sprung upon me, Struck, buffeted, and bang'd me out of measure, Throttled me, pounded me well nigh to dust— Phidip. And what less does that heretic deserve, Who will not praise Euripides, the first In wisdom of all poets? Streps. He the first! How my tongue itches!—but the rogue is ready; He'll beat me if I answer. Phidip. And with reason. Streps. What reason, graceless cub, will bear you out For beating me, who in your baby age Caress'd you, dandled you upon my knee, Watch'd every motion, humor'd all your wants? Then if you lisp'd a syllable I caught it— Bryn cried the bantling—straight I gave you drink: Mamman Bryn, Mamman, words of the nursery. it mew'd—and that forsooth was bread: Nay, I perform'd the nurse's dirtiest task, And held you out before me at your needs; And now in my necessity you show'd No mercy to the pressing calls of nature, But having pummel'd me till my poor bowels Could hold no longer, kept me fast imprison'd To struggle with occasion as I could. Chor. Now every young man's heart beats an alarm, Anxious to hear his advocate's appeal; Which if he can establish, the same right By him asserted will on all devolve, And beating then will be so much in vogue That old men's skins will be reduc'd to cobwebs— Now you, that hold up this new paradox, Look well how you defend it, for it asks No trivial reasons to enforce persuasion. Phidip. How gratefully the mind receives new lights, Emerging from the shades of prejudice, And casting old establishments aside! Time was but now, when every thought of mine Was centred in the stable; then I had not Three words upon my tongue without a stumble; But now, since I've been put into the way Of knowing better things, and the fine art Of subtil disputation, I am bold To meet this question, and convince my hearers How right it is to punish this old sinner. Streps. Mount, mount your chariot! Oh, that I could see you Seated again behind your favorite horses, Tho' 'twere with four in hand, so that you kept From driving me at such a pelting rate. Phidip. Now then I ask you, gathering up my thread Where it was broken off, if you, my father, When I was but a stripling, spar'd my back? Streps. No, for I studied all things for your good, And therefore I corrected you. Phidip. Agreed, I also am like studious of your good, And therefore I most lovingly correct you; If beating be a proof of love, you have it Plenteous in measure, for by what exemption Is your most sacred carcase freed from stripes And mine made subject to them? Am not I Free-born as you? Say, if the son's in tears, Should not the father weep? Streps. By what one rule Of equity? Phidip. What equity were that If none but children are to be chastis'd? And grant they were, the proverb's in your teeth, Which says old age is but a second childhood. Again, if tears are seen to follow blows, Ought not old men to expiate faults with tears Rather than children, who have more to plead In favor of their failings? Streps. Where's the law That warrants this proceeding? There's none such. Phidip. And what was your law-maker but a man, Mortal as you and I are? And tho' time Has sanctified his statutes, may not I Take up the cause of youth, as he of age, And publish a new ordinance for leave By the right-filial to correct our fathers, Remitting and consigning to oblivion All ex-post-facto beating? Look at instinct— Inquire of nature how the brute creation Kick at their parents, which in nothing differ From lordly man, except that they compile No laws, and hold their rights without a statute. Streps. If you are thus for pecking at your father Like a young fighting-cock, why don't you peck Your dinner from the dunghill, and at night Roost on a perch? Phidip. The cases do not tally, Nor does my master Socrates prescribe Rules so absurd. Streps. Cease then from beating me; Else you preclude yourself. Phidip. As how preclude? Streps. Because the right I have of beating you Will be your right in time over your son, When you shall have one. Phidip. But if I have none, All my sad hours are lost, and you die laughing. Streps. There's no denying that.—How say you, sirs? Methinks there is good matter in his plea; And as for us old sinners, truth to say, If we deserve a beating we must bear it. Phidip. Hear me—there's more to come— Streps. Then I am lost, For I can bear no more. Phidip. Oh fear it not, Rather believe what I have now to tell you Will cause you to make light of what is past, 'Twill bring such comfort to you. Streps. Let me have it: If it be comfort, give it me. Phidip. Then know, Henceforth I am resolv'd to beat my mother As I have beaten you. Streps. How say you? How? Why this were to out-do all you have done. Phidip. But what if I have got a proof in petto To show the moral uses of this beating? Streps. Show me a proof that you have hang'd yourself, And with your tutor Socrates beside you Gone to the devil together in a string; Those moral uses I will thank you for— Oh inauspicious goddesses, O Clouds! In you confiding all these woes fall on me. Chor. Evil events from evil causes spring, And what you suffer flows from what you've done. Streps. Why was I not forewarn'd? You saw me old, And practis'd on my weak simplicity. Chor. 'Tis not for us to warn a wilful sinner; We stay him not, but let him run his course, Till by misfortunes rous'd, his conscience wakes, And prompts him to appease th'offended gods. Streps. I feel my sorrows, but I own them just: This appeal to the Chorus, their reply to it, and the old man's acknowledgment that he merited the punishment he met with, are finely introduced, and impress a very just and natural moral on the catastrophe of the fable. Yes, ye reforming Clouds, I'm duly punish'd For my intended fraud.—And now, my son, Join hands with me and let us forth together To wreak our vengeance on those base deceivers, That Chærephon and Socrates the chief, Who have cajol'd us both. Phidip. Grace forbid I should lift up my hand against my masters. Streps. Nay, nay, but rather dread avenging Jove, God of your ancestors, and him revere. Phidip. You're mad, methinks, to talk to me of Jove— Is there a god so call'd? Streps. There is! there is! Phidip. There is no Jupiter I tell you so; Vortex has whirl'd him from his throne, and reigns By right of conquest in the thunderer's place. Streps. 'Tis false, no Vortex whirls but in my brain When in my ecstasy I fancied you An earthen deity, a farthing god. Phidip. Laugh at your own dull joke and be a fool! Streps. Insufferable blockhead that I was; What ail'd me thus to court this Socrates, Ev'n to the exclusion of the immortal gods? O Mercury, forgive me; be not angry, Dear tutelary god, but spare me still, And cast a pitying eye upon my follies, For I have been intemperate of tongue, And dearly rue it—Oh my better genius, Inspire me with thy counsel how to act, Whether by legal process to assail them, Or by such apter means as thou may'st dictate. I have it! Well hast thou inspir'd the thought; Hence with the lazy law; thou art not for it. With fire and faggot I will fall upon them, And send their school in fumo to the Clouds. Hoa, Zanthias, hoa! bring forth without delay Your ladder and your mattock, mount the roof, Break up the rafters, whelm the house upon them, And bury the whole hive beneath the ruins. Haste! if you love me, haste! Oh, for a torch, A blazing torch new lighted, to set fire To the infernal edifice.—I warrant me I'll soon unhouse the rascals, that now carry Their heads so high, and roll them in the dust. (The School is attacked, and the Disciples run out.) First Disciple. Fire! Fire! Streps. If fire is what you want, 'tis here; Torch, play your part, and you'll have fire enough. First Disciple. What are you doing, fellow? Streps. Chopping logic; Arguing a knotty point with your house-beams. Second Disciple. Oh horror! Who has set our house on fire? Streps. The very man whose cloak you nabb'd so neatly. Second Disciple. Undone and ruin'd—! Streps. Heartily I wish it— And mean you should so be if this same mattock Does not deceive my hopes, and I escape With a whole neck. (Socrates comes forth.) Socr. Hoa there! What man is that? You there upon the roof—What are you doing? Streps. Treading on air—contemplating the sun— Socr. Ah me! I'm suffocated, smother'd, lost— (Chærephon appears.) Chærephon. Wretch that I am, I'm melted, scorch'd, consum'd!— Streps. Blasphemers, why did you insult the gods? Dash, drive, demolish them! Their crimes are many, But their contemptuous treatment of the gods, Their impious blasphemies, exceed them all. Chor. Break up!—The Chorus have fulfill'd their part.</field>
