      <field name="fulltext">FAITH'S FRAUD. A Tragedy in Five Acts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Lord of Weilenberg and Rolandseck. Albert, Elector Palatine, and Count of Godesberg. Rudestein, A Soldier, and Kinsman of Weilenberg. Philip, Chaplain of Rolandseck. Screitch, Seneschal of Rolandseck. Hubert, Page to Count Albert. Baroness of Weilenberg and Rolandseck. Ellen, Only Daughter of the Baron and Baroness. Prioress of Rolandswerth. Barbara and Ursula, Ladies attendant on the Baroness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scenes are either in the Castle of Rolandseck, situated on a lofty rock above the Rhine, or in the Convent of Rolandswerth, built upon a large Island immediately below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Chamber in the Castle. Rudestein and Screitch. SCREITCH. He is unhappy, and we should forbear; I pray be patient with him. RUDESTEIN. Am I not? Though patience chafe me like a seal-skin boot, I groan and do endure the need of it. Lend thou thine oil to lubricate content. Thou hast thy purse and spurs, thy chain and batonâ What dost thou lack, unless it be a wife? My having is but blood, as old as his Who lords it o'er his kinsman thus. A wife! What need of that? SCREITCH. Who gibes me for my purse, Should render back the gold that made its glory. My spurs dost envy? hast thou not my horse? RUDESTEIN. I had thy horse. SCREITCH. The prodigal finds a home, Though neither son nor servant. Thou dost eat, Thankless, as well as chargeless. RUDESTEIN. Grant me patience! We never meet, but some such canticle; A starling might be taught it in a week: Repay my lendings!âgive me back my horse!â I do abhor to hear thee. SCREITCH. Then disburse. RUDESTEIN. Ten times I offered to redeem him for thee. Whose injury was it that I lacked the means? I prayed thee but for sixty crowns. SCREITCH. Thou hadst Six score already, and my horse was borrowed To go in search of payment. RUDESTEIN. Well, he went. SCREITCH. He did, long since; nor is he yet come back. RUDESTEIN. Why should we fast our youth with Seneca, And barefoot visit learning in her schools, If this be all age profits? Did he teach To mount thy soul's contentment on a horse? I brought another in his placeâgo to. SCREITCH. Of thrice his age; in stature, strength, and bulk, At most one third: goat-faced he was, dim-sighted, Hide-bound, and stridulous in his breath: his chine Had weals from end to end: being scant behind, His huge head found no equal balance there, But hung its slumbers on the horseman's arm. Reined up too much, he stopped; and back too little, He either stumbled, or did worse. RUDESTEIN. In flesh Thine did exceed, and mine as much in years. Is it wise to chafe at differences like these? Have I no grievances, no injuries? Who thrusts his knees for ever in my flank?â Who whispers prophesies for base advantageâ Extols his substance with comparisonsâ His wisdom, grace, and scholarship? SCREITCH. Ay, who? RUDESTEIN. Thou, seneschal! I say it of thyself; Before this simple wretchâthis Barbara! Wouldst tempt her love away by craft, and shake Thine ears at spendthriftsârise, by humbling others! SCREITCH. Thou didst disparage learning in her sight, Provoke the child to ignorant jests, and weigh My birth with thine and hers. Ah, ah! I have thee, Thy back 'twixt ditch and wall! Unlawful arms Against unlawful, in defence, are lawful. The jurists rule it so. RUDESTEIN. Her age I spake of. The maid is young and nobleâwe match better. SCREITCH. How old dost count thyself? I grant thee younger, Some six or eight years younger, perhaps. RUDESTEIN. No more? SCREITCH. Be it more or less, who cares? Well, ten then is it? Say peradventure twelve. RUDESTEIN. The same it is, As 'twixt our horsesâno great odds in either. Not old, yet art thou studious, seneschal, And one so wise might awe a child like her. I could yield much to him I loved indeed: But friends are kind, forbearing one another; They lend, divide, nor seek their own again. Is it not Tully writes so? Friendship, truly! Exacting crown for crown, and steed for steed! Nay, spurning peace with just equivalents! That niggard waywardness enthrals a spirit Which else were eagle-winged. SCREITCH. Thou thinkest to please me. RUDESTEIN. For what? for thwarting all I do? Henceforth Strive which may woo the best. Thou shalt not have her. I please thee?âI defy thee! SCREITCH. Hush! the Baron! Speak not in haste again. (Exit Screitch. Enter Weilenberg.) RUDESTEIN. Your lordship seeks me? Screitch told me of your lordship's haste. WEILENBERG. What else? RUDESTEIN. Of happy changes since last nightâsound sleep, And sweet refreshment. If my cousin may rest, She will gain strength. WEILENBERG. She woke refreshed to-day, And asked for Philip. Did he tell thee so? RUDESTEIN. He chose me for the messenger to find him. WEILENBERG. Well, shall we see this father? RUDESTEIN. If we wait. WEILENBERG. While others breathe with interrupted breath, Thou ever hast some straw to stop and stoop forâ A spaniel lost last night, the boats returning, Or cooler weather with the change of wind!â Hast found him, man? RUDESTEIN. An hour, or more, ago. WEILENBERG. Where? RUDESTEIN. Penned in his confessional at church; With ear inclining to the contrite sighs Of guilt exhaled 'midst garlic. 'Twas the wife Of Schwaile the ferryman who wept so much. I would have filled his place and sent him hither. WEILENBERG. Our haste must wait confessions. RUDESTEIN. Mine could not. He had his choice to come with me on foot, Or carried in his cage. WEILENBERG. Who gave such licence? RUDESTEIN. Your lordship blamed my tardinessâI his. WEILENBERG. Soâwill he come, then? RUDESTEIN. He is come already: Is goneâand if we tarry where we are, He may be looked for back again. Pray, patience! WEILENBERG. Gone whither? RUDESTEIN. To the baroness, no doubt. My younger cousinâthe fairy-footed Ellen, Found out and led him by the gallery stairs. But first apprised us of this change last night; Free breath and peaceful slumbers: we will hope That health comes with, or after them. WEILENBERG. She may, I would not if I could. RUDESTEIN. My playfellow Basks freely in the sunshine of her faith; And so do I in mine. Wisdom meanwhileâ If this blear-eyed and sickly slut be sheâ Creeps ever on the shady side of truth; Preferring owls to cuckoos. Providence! I humbly crave forbearance as a foolâ But how does foresight profit us? The best That best philosophy can teach is thisâ To make the wise man such by argument, As fools are made by instinctâeasy, careless. Our snail-horned ignorance scarce forefeels an inch: Yet are we happier than my politic lord Who borrows daily from to-morrow's news. Were I as he at such a time as this, I could find peace with little looking for. WEILENBERG. If nature keep her mysteries for the blind, And can indeed purge from them grief, or dread, Or both in oneâremorse; to be her scholar, And read, as ignorance points, the lore of foolsâ Extorting peace from all repugnancesâ Were worth a hundred-fold the names thou givest me, Whether miscalled or not. Now what wouldst teach? RUDESTEIN. To hold the present hard, if goodâto think, If good or not, the future will be better. The baroness slept last nightâshe is refreshed, And will be well again. WEILENBERG. But hope is bridled: She cannot slip the bit to range at will, O'erleaping sense and probability. Three times, despite of hope, I lost a son. RUDESTEIN. Still the chase cheers us while the game is up: When missed, we seek some other sport. If Heaven Have called my little cousins to himself, All is not carried with them. Should he ask One saintly spirit moreâabides there not Of this world's wealth sufficient for content? Two spacious baronies, the public awe, A name observed by kings, and such a daughter As kings might sue for? WEILENBERG. What we have repays not For what we lose, being part of what we had. RUDESTEIN. We should build up the breach mischance has battered, O'ermastering casualty. The swallow ceases Reproachful chattering on the chimney's top Against the last night's tempest, to repair Her broken tenement with better heed, Or hang a new one closer to the eaves. The bee flies fiercely round his rifled hive, Threat'ning awhile the spoilerâthen resumes His labor 'midst the yet untasted flowers New-blown since yesterday. Why should we men Strive to put out the stars when night is longest, And mount despair behind calamity? WEILENBERG. How point these ancient maxims? RUDESTEIN. Such as Iâ Supposing what we fearâI would address me To mend misfortune. WEILENBERG. How? RUDESTEIN. By raising up Three other sons, at least, as comfortersâ Providing first another baroness. My lord has time enough. WEILENBERG. We have not all These bestial privileges. Men must take What nature portions to humanity, Be it good or illâand heirs of life's estate Discharge life's debts. They feel as brutes do not: They have affections, passions, faculties, Oft to their own unhappiness. RUDESTEIN. The wise! These are the wise, heaven help them! Such as Iâ In life's dull lane an assâhave shade and sunshine, With mossy banks to browse upon: the spring Feasts me with violets: when the briar-rose fades, The thistle seems digestible enough. So nature wears her old simplicity, Unlaced, unfringed, unliveried. WEILENBERG. I used to find Such singleness of heart betokening mischief, Or else an empty purse. Simplicity! Is it kin to innocenceâor how? RUDESTEIN. In partâ To bestial innocence it is. Yet look, Your ass, in this, will differ from your kid. Wayward he is, and spiteful if misusedâ Inclined to sensualityâbut still A faithful servant little praised or cared forâ The better brute, at last, for being so brutish. Spring's sunshine will awake her flowersâthe wind Again blow southerly. At present, my lord Shoulders the blast which bites him to the bone, And winter's frost seems endless: but I look For happier nuptials, male posterity, And hospitable usages. Of late This house feels chill. WEILENBERG. Then seek a happier one! Another mistress shall not mock the first. Wouldst have me kill a second? RUDESTEIN. Kill! who kills? WEILENBERG. Ay, kill, sirâOne is dyingâI have killed herâ And by the hardest kind of deathâby sorrow! Lived here so long, and never heard of that? The grooms and scullions know it. RUDESTEIN. What, my lord? WEILENBERG. Why that her heart is breaking, man. They love The meek and graciousâall but thou and I. We two are kin indeedâbrutes, as thou saidst. I have not spared thy frailtiesâso speak outâ They would, but dare not, call me murderer. RUDESTEIN. Good sooth, these starts are pitiful! WEILENBERG. Begone! Leave off, I say. RUDESTEIN. Authority may edge The spirit too sharply for those silken bands Which love enchains his idlers with. Ah me! Such beings imperious should not wed the meek. WEILENBERG. They should not wed at all. RUDESTEIN. Perhaps notâfor love Suits simple natures less sublime, like mine. We kiss and quarrel fiercely while it lasts; And when it ends, we are but where we were: Heart-breaking there is none. Give me my choice, 'Twere better be the goat Silenus rides on, Than claw Jove's thunder backed by Ganymede. Men live on those who follow them. My lord Will choose a husband for his child, and thus Secure what nature grants not one in tenâ The son that pleases him. WEILENBERG. What son? RUDESTEIN. Count Albert. WEILENBERG. He does not please me. RUDESTEIN. No!âI grieve at that! WEILENBERG. Why shouldst thou grieve? RUDESTEIN. Because my cousin is pleased. Methinks she shows discernment. He is not Some ringlet-pated page, the thirteenth darling Of some poor gentlewomanâfortune's feather Blown from her wing when midway in the skies, To light, at last, and navigate a sewer: But loftier in his place than all of usâ In means, and name, and ancestry as great. The list of princely names holds his the highest: My lord will some time read it there. WEILENBERG. Till then, Spare thou to aid his suit against my will. Strain less a kinsman's privilege: bethink thee That both are guests, and one, at least, unwelcome. RUDESTEIN. Hear me a wordâbear with me! Is it just That hereâthat in my kinsman's houseânot mineâ I should apportion hospitality? That I should judge between his guests? dispense My grace as hisâgreet oneâfrown off another? The count, a stranger, seemed to claim my service The more because his host had graver cares Than forest sports and table cheer. WEILENBERG. He did so. I would not seem neglectfulâhe should not Stay loitering here till jostled out by death. His welcome was a forced oneâthis he knowsâ Besought by great and zealous friends of bothâ And, like our peace, reluctant. Honest it was, At least on my part, but disclaiming love. Why linger here at Rolandseck? RUDESTEIN. To gain My little cousin's gentler love instead. WEILENBERG. It would avail as nothing by itself. RUDESTEIN. Then all those friends, with all their charity, And mighty arbitrationâbacked by honor, High lineage, princely meansâthough both sides meet In years and bloodâ WEILENBERG. Will his mix well with thine? Our blood lies on the ground. RUDESTEIN. And let it lie! WEILENBERG. We may, and will, pass by it unrevenged, But not step on, or over it. Whence come These charities which live so far from home? His father slew thine uncle. RUDESTEIN. I forgive. WEILENBERG. And so do Iâmust we adopt him too? RUDESTEIN. Alas, my little cousin, then! WEILENBERG. She proves Her wisdom by obedience. Fancy's feverâ Which fools call loveâis less with her than duty; It does not spoil her for a nurse. RUDESTEIN. Why no: At seven years old her heart could scarce beat easier, Till this Count's courtship, and her mother's sickness Taught it sometimes a sigh or two. With such Grief bides not long. Her little wisdom is So far like mine still lessâbestial the one, The other bird-likeâhigh in air it hovers, On dewy wing midway 'twixt this green earth And that blue sky, as if uncertain which Should be its resting place, whether to go on, Or flutter down again. Here comes the father. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A terrace running along the foundation of the Castle, high above the Rhine. Baroness Weilenberg, supported by Ellen and Ursula. BARONESS. Now we may spare thee, Ursula; wait within, And bring us Barbara when we call. She is A careless nurse, halving her task unfairly. [Exit Ursula. Thou, child, canst prop me to the nearest bench. Stay, let us rest us here awhile. ELLEN. Take breathâ The air is yet too sultry. BARONESS. Some stray breeze Will soon be here, if any where. ELLEN. The boats Have dropped their sails for want of oneâlook down! BARONESS. The depth would make me giddy, child. I feel, Or fancy that I feel the river's freshness, Even here so high. ELLEN. My mother scarce had strength For such a journey, with so little help, A month, or more ago. BARONESS. It is her last. She will not stray so far as this again. Fie, babe! what, tears! We must be resolute, Or else be gone. ELLEN. That seat is still your favorite. BARONESS. I longed to visit it again. The sick Feed petty wishes till grown great. Nay, some Not sick have dainty spirits which loathe the hard But wholesome aliment of daily life. Here have I nursed thee, Ellenâhave played with thee, And taught the little that I knew. There needs No promise to return when I am gone. The places that we love have tongues and voices Which speak of those loved in them. LookâI grieve thee! But yet it is to warn and do thee good. Trouble disperses as my time grows less: One thought alone disturbs me. ELLEN. Tell it me. BARONESS. Beshrew my blushesâfor I scarce know how! They have been shameful hindrances too long. ELLEN. A secret, is it? BARONESS. Ay, child, yoursânot mine. Both need not feel thus maidenly. This guestâ This princely guest of oursâtreads hard on sufferance. I would make duty easier, if I could. Thou and thy father do not judge alike: His thoughts and mine agree. We both dare trust thee: Yet fancy young as thine may wreath its flowers To crown a tyrant with them unawares. Such airy gallantries, with love to help, May task obedience heavily, not vainly. ELLEN. I have no judgment to contend with either: Nor shall I have. BARONESS. None else can love so much, Nor half so holily, as he and I. Stern as this Father seems, and is, indeed, Thou hast been sometimes blessed beyond thy knowledge, His pride and playthingânay, I do thee wrongâ A gracious ministress to both of us, Thy steps were on the rainbow bringing peace. But now a child no more, the task is harder: Beware reproachful tears, and looks like dread! They hint at tyranny. The loftier spirits Range not with ours: pride stirred by self-reproach Augments injustice: consciousness of wrong, Revenging what it suffers, strikes again The wronged, whose silence plagues it. Even in love 'Tis easier to forgive than be forgiven. Because we loved, we both have been unhappy. ELLEN. Pray God forbear me if I sometimes lost Such reverence for him when I saw your tears! Nor thought how much he suffered too. BARONESS. He most! The impatient fret at their own fretfulness. In just proportion as he bruised its peace, He grew distrustful of my love. ELLEN. If so, What will become of me? BARONESS. As God shall please! It is to Him I give and leave thee, babe. ELLEN. My mother must be happy. BARONESS. I am so now. There may be promises we know not of, Till life has almost left us; and a time When sickliest breathings may suffice to turn The everlasting gate upon its hinge, And show those mansions which we seek within. ELLEN. Do you believe in this? BARONESS. Now, faithfully. ELLEN. And did not always? But we speak too much. BARONESS. Then peace a moment! Look beneath the sun. ELLEN. How steadily your sight endures his rays, While mine, though strong, is dazzled! BARONESS. Canst discern A tree stand singly? ELLEN. With a tower beyond it? I never noticed either there before. BARONESS. Nor I but once. ELLEN. It has been sport to count The towers and mountains which we see from hence: Few ever found their number twice the same. That which we mark is small, and far away. My mother, are those tears again? BARONESS. Mouse, mouseâ She is a child again, so bear with her! When thou hadst yet scarce words enough for comfort, Thy mother came to kneel where we rest now, And pray for patience with an end like this. She asked to see thee what thou art. The Rhine Ran down between his purple hills as redâ There was the same light over them. The sun Descended as I ceased: the tower and tree Before his radiance stood as they stand now. Why should I care for this? Though undiscerned, They and the mountains do not change their place! They have been always there:âbut welcome folly, Which makes remembrance thankful! ELLEN. There is moreâ Ask Ursula why I say so. Neither yet Has ever seen my mother's eye so clear: The voice is what it used to be: she woke With smiles, and has been happy all day long. BARONESS. I have beenâboth judged rightlyânow I am Even happier still. To tell thee why I was so I brought thee here. Joy gave me strength: there is Enough beside this sunset. If I see His rays no more, he leaves the best farewell. My wealth has made me prodigalâand the tongue Tires ere its tale beginsâremind me of it. I shall sleep well again through weariness. Come, let us try to walk without these girls. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Chamber in the Castle. Rudestein, Screitch, and Barbara. BARBARA. They should make haste who wait upon her hence. My lady's thread runs fine almost to breaking: She cannot tarry past a week. SCREITCH. Who says so? BARBARA. I, and the doctors too. SCREITCH. She slept last night? BARBARA. Ay, and is brisk upon her feet to dayâ But may not bide. Now for the blacker sort: Your bread-and-butter sprites are all set down. Canst reckon me the adverse part as truly? Such as do love combustion, vexing peaceâ Rudesteinâhobgoblins, mischief-machinists, Who twist unstable things, like me, awry? Or must these pass unnumbered to the priests? Was Pythius such? SCREITCH. And Merazin, and Circe: Some count their several nations up to nine. Psellus makes six alone beneath the moon; But leaves the Manes out, and doubts the LamiÃ¦: GazÃ¦us says they swarm. BARBARA. Has any seen them? SCREITCH. By his confession, Paracelsus oft. Agrippa's dog had one of them. All these Are ill to know, and worse the SuccubÃ¦. Most water-devils bear a foul report. Wood-nymphs are milder natured, Folliotts, Trulli, And some think Panâbut I judge otherwise. There needs no priest to deal with these. BARBARA. Who else? Couldst thou suffice? SCREITCH. I might. BARBARA. They yield to words? SCREITCH. Ay, so we speak with potency, they do. BARBARA. What thinkest thou, Rudestein? RUDESTEIN. Partly like GazÃ¦usâ That earth, at least, is one great hive of fools. Hog's eyes I lack, and cannot view the windâ The swarms I see I credit. BARBARA. Nothing more? RUDESTEIN. Scarcely so much at all times, simple one! BARBARA. Thou shalt be burnt! RUDESTEIN. For what? BARBARA. For heresy. RUDESTEIN. My faith is pure and steadfast, Bab, to thee. BARBARA. Dost not believe the privilege of thine house? RUDESTEIN. One half I do. BARBARA. Which half? RUDESTEIN. That we shall die. It ever has been so at Rolandseckâ The privilege is no narrow one:âbeing called, That we shall dieânot called, shall cease to live. BARBARA. How then? RUDESTEIN. Ask Screitch. SCREITCH. All wiser men believe it. BARBARA. Believe they what?âthat whoso dies the last Returns for him that is to dieâis it so? RUDESTEIN. I wave the privilege of mine house! The last May let me live forgotten. SCREITCH. So he will; Or pretermit. The good are visited, And by the goodânone else. RUDESTEIN. Why wait for guides, Whose road runs straight enough? SCREITCH. They need them not: But pass the happier to their place of rest, Being welcomed on the threshold. Such as thou Are outlaws from the charter of their blood; And grope their downward passage in the dark, Jostled by fear. BARBARA. There is a prophesy; Three called, and one called thrice, shall be the last? SCREITCH. Three calledâthe last before the first is buriedâ Shall leave the roofs of Rolandseck in ashes. RUDESTEIN. This ends our line! We must provide against it Both sons and daughters, Barbaraâthou and I. SCREITCH. Thy father died unblessed. BARBARA. Peace! What be these My lady looks so long for?âsensible sprites, Or airy substances? RUDESTEIN. How dost thou name them? The souls of our progenitors, or shades That ape their likenesses? BARBARA. Canst answer him? How teach the books? RUDESTEIN. Mark, Bab! BARBARA. What, not know that! RUDESTEIN. His well of learning is drawn dry! BARBARA. Fie, Screitch! SCREITCH. Each is a Soul's Eidolonânow art answered? RUDESTEIN. Ay verily! Thou dost exceed thy teachers; Thyself being what thou teachest. (Exit Rudestein.) BARBARA. Get thee gone! How near a fool he seemed, and yet escapes! SCREITCH. I fain would kiss thee, Bab, for speaking that. BARBARA. A Soul's Eidolon! foh! the saints forbid! Good sooth not Iâfirst clear thyself. SCREITCH. Of what? BARBARA. How should a man have grown so free with marvels? A christian man with SuccubÃ¦ and Fawns? I doubt this learning, if it all came straight. There was a maid, they say, who lived near Treves, Till married with some doctor from abroad, Whose eldest son had horns! SCREITCH. And not the doctor? BARBARA. These might have been inherited, past doubt: But strange in such a child! (Exeunt.) SCENE IV. Chamber in the Castle. Count Albert and Rudestein. RUDESTEIN. This love should sun itself abroad. Your Grace Has lost a salutary sight to-day. COUNT. What sight? RUDESTEIN. The Father Philip firstâbehind, Two of Saint Margaret's virgins from the isle, Veiled to the knee. He bare the altar-roodâ They looked nor right, nor left, nor straight before them; But bowed their tearful eyes upon the ground. COUNT. This seems extremity, indeedâgood lady!â What dost thou know about their eyes and tears, If veiled so closely as thou sayest? RUDESTEIN. Not much Touching the eyes of one of them. She hath A spacious foot, goes near above the groundâ Is scanty in the hams, long-flanked, and feeble: Wall-eyed, no doubt, or one-eyed. When I spoke She stumbled and stopped short. COUNT. What didst thou say? RUDESTEIN. âFair Lady! gentle sister!â with obeisance. The other stepped as lightly as a fawnâ From her, I begged a blessingâknelt before her, And called her âgracious mother.â Learn this, sir: In naming women ever misapplyâ Confound the epithet. Your fair one knows That she is fairâyour wise that she is wise: But each desires the other's attribute; And he who gives earns praise. This younger nun Was pleased with seeming gravity: the elder Discerned a right discerning gentleman. COUNT. What matters if it pleased or no, being nuns, And one being old? RUDESTEIN. Good catechist, take heed, Take special heed to please the old and homely! The fair are easily pleasedâtheir fairness pleases. Opinion rules the worldâboth love, and hate, And reason too, are all subordinate: Imagination leads them all. Thinkest thou These sisters whisper but to one another? Wouldst have the covey?âstrive to catch the hen. COUNT. Here comes a small and solitary chickâ One tamed without such methodâby the force Of simple fascination, was it not? RUDESTEIN. Mine own domestic sparrow, Barbara. Enter Barbara. BARBARA. What did he say of sparrows? COUNT. He called thee such, Thou bird of Venus, when her doves are chaste. But first about these sisters from the isleâ What brings them here so high? They would not make Mine Ellen a nun? BARBARA. They may make one of me. I tire of this ill world, its Counts and cousins! COUNT. But wherefore, good young maiden? BARBARA. Because if good, I have been better, and if young, been younger. RUDESTEIN. And if a maid?âgo on. COUNT. What cousins and Counts? BARBARA. One is a scornful mischief-making idler About mid-age, who whispered love most falsely: The other, sir, is mightyâfor he helps At times to make the mightiestâcount! elector! Prince Palatine! what not! his grace! his highness! And younger he, but worse. The first beguiled A simple heart to follyâhe has taught it How to betray the simple. COUNT. Whom? BARBARA. My lady: The lamb my mistress. Both together, teach me To drink, tell tales, and aid the impudent. RUDESTEIN. Hush now! be still! BARBARA. What dost thou harken at? RUDESTEIN. The father Philipâas I am a Christian! BARBARA. It will be ruin if he find me here! RUDESTEIN. Peace, child! BARBARA. I hear his sandal on the stairs: Where shall I hide me? RUDESTEIN. Lift thine apron upâ And stand before us tremblingâchoke thyselfâ Weep, Bab! weep bitterly!âIt is his work: (Enter Father Philip.) We have no power to pardon thee. Hush! peace! Father, we need thee much, and yet must grieve thee. Seest thou this maid? PHILIP. Ayâwhat do maidens here? Your highness sent to find me? COUNT. Thanks, good Philip. I would beseech a word or two apart. RUDESTEIN. 'Tis charitable seeking in his grace: She how she weeps!âbut let her weep! PHILIP. For what? RUDESTEIN. The maid has erred from truth, and should repent. PHILIP. What ails thee, child? I heard thy mistress call thee: What hast thou done? RUDESTEIN. My cousin! Did Ellen call her? The wretch is shamed, then! PHILIP. How? RUDESTEIN. She hath untied An ordinance of the Church to-day, and reached Her hand in theft! PHILIP. Alas!âhow knowest thou this? How happens it that trespasses like these Were found of thee so early? RUDESTEIN. I surprised her! The child does not deny it. PHILIP. What! in theft? RUDESTEIN. It being a vigil, and Saint Martin's eve, She ate of remnants which her mistress leftâ The boiled white of an egg! COUNT. And did excuse it! The day was not rememberedâand the egg In part was hersâher perquisite! RUDESTEIN. Behold She comes to crave of us her sin's remission! But do thou teach that theft is damnable; And all forgetfulness augments the sin! PHILIP. Go, get thee gone, child. Shun these scorners, Barbara. They practise on thine ignorance. It is not The vigil of Saint Martinâand the egg Was harmless, part or whole. RUDESTEIN. Then go thy way. Thy mistress calls thee: look, thou art forgiven! COUNT. Sweet Barbara, run, and bear my services. BARBARA. Needs tell my lady what I did amiss? RUDESTEIN. Being done unwittingly, it is not needed. (Exit Barbara.) PHILIP. Fie! fie! what silly pastime is this tyranny! O'er one so innocent too! RUDESTEIN. The Count in love Is meditative, melancholy, moody, Unsocial past companionship. Beseech thee Give countenance to a cup of wine? PHILIP. I drink No wine to-day. My counsel for his love, Is temperance, till it leave him. There will be No shorter remedies than sleep and patience. RUDESTEIN. His love will end in charity. What else Could make thyself the gracious man thou art? These nuns are near to lose their patroness: Yet may they find a better comforter. PHILIP. Not in this world. RUDESTEIN. If that which good men prayâ Unchristian enmities be all forgotâ The Count may join his substance with my cousin's, And so their means wax two-fold. PHILIP. They suffice. RUDESTEIN. He may augment their numberâmake more of them. COUNT. How are they called? RUDESTEIN. The nuns of Rolandswerth. Their office is to watch before the tomb Where Roland sleeps with all mine ancestors. The bones of twenty generations rest Safe in their care and sanctity. They live As willing prisoners in the isle below. COUNT. How came they hither, then, to-day? RUDESTEIN. Our house, Which founded, has protected and endowed; Not humbly, like their customs, but as suits Its own munificence. Yet they say no. They thank us only for our rain and sunshine, And claim priority, as planted first. Love perched us here, they say, to overlook them: For this we built our battlements so high. COUNT. How did he find them out?âhe blind, and they So thickly veiled? RUDESTEIN. Our Roland loved a maidâ The maid became a nunâthe nun dwelt here: And better in his eyes the roof above her, The chimney on that roof, or from that chimney The smokeâthough watery air, and far from pureâ Than all the realms he conquered with the sword. COUNT. What be their vows? They may come out, it seems? PHILIP. They do to tend on sickness, visit want, Or pray with misery. RUDESTEIN. Then send them hither. His highness makes me miserableâhe is Sick of celibacy, and wants a wife. COUNT. Is it true they see not one another's faces? RUDESTEIN. They keep no glass in which to see their own. Who knows what eyes may hide behind those veils, If they themselves do not! PHILIP. And who need care? RUDESTEIN. Iâas the twentieth in descent from Roland. PHILIP. Fie! Rudestein, fie! RUDESTEIN. Ay, fie! That fatherly face May not be hid from them, if theirs from thee. And this, at least, I do believeâ PHILIP. Say what? RUDESTEIN. Why, that it is a very goodly faceâ Has none of them confessed so much to thee? PHILIP. My lord, adieu! RUDESTEIN. Nay, pritheeâwhy so brief? The Baroness hath better health to-day: She will not die? PHILIP. Dost think so? RUDESTEIN. Ay, I do: And have a second hook to hitch belief onâ She is not called. PHILIP. Who told thee? RUDESTEIN. Then she is? COUNT. How called? RUDESTEIN. The good amongst us may not quit Till sent for by the one who went before them. The last defunct invites his follower. I look for special heralds some day soon. PHILIP. Again good night, my Lordâwith better health, And wiser company! [Exit Philip. COUNT. All he can tell Is that my love must find its ease in patience! No doubt but he can tell. Such watchers stand Aloft, like windcocks o'er our battlements, Surveying all beneath them and around them: They mark which way it blows! Dull wooing here, By snatches twice a week! RUDESTEIN. Then quit unmarried. Be gone in peace, a bachelor. COUNT. And wouldâ But that the dice are comforters. RUDESTEIN. Not mineâ I shall be soon a beggar from the deaf! COUNT. You take in gold the difference when you win: And pay your losses with the hope of Ellen. Bring purse as well as tables. RUDESTEIN. But your grace Slips not the reckoning day by dayâthere is A parchment history of our debts and duesâ The bond, the declaration, hand and seal. I am a church-porch beggar, save his dish! Two thousand crowns in debt! COUNT. The bride shall free thee. The day of payment is the wedding day. Till then, I must have tokens if I win. My stake is goldâthine mortgages on Roland; Some castle with its gates of chrysolite. RUDESTEIN. The Baron does not love theeâand he says His daughter shall not love thee. I endured Rebuke to-day, meddling on thy behalf. The father of your highness slew mine uncle! COUNT. Ayâso he did. RUDESTEIN. The Saints forgive him freelyâ I do, as one of them. COUNT. This daughter's love I have, and I will hold the while I may. RUDESTEIN. He frets against the friends who made your peace, And me who sing your praises. He will fright No second wife to deathâbut sad and single, Live all life long in solitude. We two Must quit his house! COUNT. A pestilence on his house! At least while his. How quit it, being in love? Pride still grows prouder, chained by benefits Which cannot be requited nor refused. Would I might blow the horn before his gates, And throw the gauntlet over them! RUDESTEIN. Be patient! Mine is a hateful need, repaid by hate. Fat Cupid buys not me with Baronies! COUNT. Caitiff! dost mock my love?âI own it was soâ But now, by all his wronged divinityâ This Vestal's fire has caught me and consumes me! Coy she was ever toward meâyet at first Gay, sisterly, suspicionless, and gentle. She blushes now and shuns meânay, her eyes Are filled with tearsâand therefore now she loves me. RUDESTEIN. Bah! what care I about her tears?âThis way. The dice are locked within, and cooler wine. My Barbara does not blush, but bite. Now Fortune! [Exeunt. SCENE V. Chamber of the Baroness. The Baroness on a couch. Ellen and Ursula. BARONESS. Take the lamp farther from me, Ursula, And set the hour-glass in its place. It is The good old moralist, no whit the worse For being so old. Mark when the sand is spent: We may not hear the clock. Our safer wisdom Is left behind in search of something strangeâ Not new, but lost awhile, and so forgot. This lesson is of both worlds, numbering time Rather for what it ends in, than itself. Still stands the image graven on our tombsâ And, if we trust the sculptor, it comprises Half of death's wealth and furniture. Who placed These pillows where I wished them?âBarbara? ELLEN. Are they uneasy?âit was I. BARONESS. No, childâ Sickness so nursed is kin to luxury. Then Barbara did forget them? ELLEN. Yes. BARONESS. I feared so. You two are not forgetful. Ursula, I shall release thee soon, so stay thou near meâ Be with me at the lastâbut keep her henceâ Let her not see me die. ELLEN. Forgive her this; She is unhappy that you love her not. We told her that she might be spared to-night, So far the fault is ours. URSULA. I told her so. ELLEN. Speak in the morning kindly to her. BARONESS. Wellâ Nay, God forbid that I should speak unkindly! Have I seemed harsh of late? URSULA. Even less than ever: Yet should I feel unhappy were I Barbara. BARONESS. She will be easily pacified! It is But little sign of charity to say soâ In truth I cannot love her. There appears No right agreement 'twixt her lips and eyes. Sickness is superstitious. ELLEN. We put by Something to be reminded of. BARONESS. Ay, now. ELLEN. When speech is easier I will ask again: Rest till to-morrow come. BARONESS. It never may. We must not wait for morrows. Watch in turns. I make the burden heavier through my scruplesâ Yet send me not this Barbara. Go, and sleep: God grant thee peace like mine, good Ursula! [Exit Ursula. I leave some signs of love for both these girls; But not alike, nor do thou trust alike. Thy mother's little wisdom still grows less: And yet she cares notâit will last while she does: 'Twere better risk ill thoughts of it, than hide What haply might bring comfort if believed. Sit nearer; let me see thee while I mayâ Last night I saw thy brothers, Babe. ELLEN. In dreams? BARONESS. Ay, dreamsâsick fool!âa babbler of her dreams! Yet such they were as well endured the waking. Day's brightest certainties grow dim beside them! Wouldst hear, to pity me? ELLEN. I know the less, Since tales which others told were hushed by you. My mother did not credit this before? BARONESS. At least she did not teach it thee. There is But One to fear, yet hope for. If there hide Aught else behind the veil which parts from death, We must not seek it yet. What I shall tell thee May be believed in, or may notâit bears No sacred warrant with itâtake or leave itâ It makes thy mother happier. ELLEN. Teach it me! BARONESS. What dost thou know already, Babe? Speak first. Tell me the truthâthou hearest it every day. It is the castle's whisper nowâthe text Whence Ursula draws her homilies. When death Is in, or near, the house, we all remember. ELLEN. Who dies at Rolandseck awakes the next Who is to die? BARONESS. Who dies in charity. Go onâWhat else hast learnt? ELLEN. The happiest they To whom the vision chances more than once. BARONESS. More than one message, or one messenger, Is blessed, but rareâas given in grace, not terror. There is, beside, a prophecyâwhat is it? ELLEN. Three called, and one called thriceâshall be the last. It ends our line. BARONESS. Thou hast been truly taught, Yet pay not Ursula back with what I tell thee. ELLEN. You saw my brothers? BARONESS. Ay, methinks I did. ELLEN. They died too young for visions. BARONESS. Who knows that? They died too young to tell us of them, child. Didst hear the priory clock strike twelve last night? I did, who slept. ELLEN. It struck, and loudly tooâ The casements were unclosed. BARONESS. Didst ever count So many, and so truly, in thy sleep? These were not dreamsâBring me some water, babe. At last this speaking wearies me. Sit nearâ Look to the hour-glass ere the sand run out; Let us both pray at midnight. ELLEN. It is gone! Midnight is passed already! while we spoke The sand is spent:âAsleep! so suddenlyâ I did not mark the clockâHow still she lies! The bosom rises with the breath, or else These slumbers would affright me! O my mother! Patience so meek as thine and charity Are surer guidance to the hope beyond Than aught in dreams. This weariness overcomes meâ I will not sleepâbut pray for bothânot sleepâ (She leans upon the couch above her mother and sleeps. A distant clock slowly strikes twelve. The chamber becomes lighterâthen soft music, as if in the air, and voices.) The heart of grief is breakingâcome to rest! Look back no more, since leaving what thou hast, Is not forsaking. Come, then, twice-called! the meek are blessed With calmer sleep when this is pastâ With happier waking. The veil is fallenâFaith's innocent fraud confessedâ All which life loves and loses lives at lastâ The heart is breaking! END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Hall of the Castle. Count Albert and Rudestein. COUNT. The lamps are burning; 'tis not midnight yet. RUDESTEIN. Whether or no, we are the last awake. COUNT. Thy chamber is too sultry, thou too choleric: Walk here awhile and cool. RUDESTEIN. I care not where. With larger room the devil may ease our elbows. We packed too close before. COUNT. His hap was hardest: It scarce could be his choice. RUDESTEIN. This is not skill, Nor luck, nor drink! COUNT. May he account for it? RUDESTEIN. He hath his partialities, no doubt; Nor fails to help his favoritesâstill the preference Were gross between your highness and myself. A hundred crowns! COUNT. 'Twere better ponder first The time to pay these debts, than how we made them. Nor I nor he can rightly guess at that. RUDESTEIN. I do abhor all mysteries! COUNT. Nevertheless This payment is a great one.âSo then ignorance Has marred thy better fortune? RUDESTEIN. I did not gain My learning from the conjuror, great or small; Nor how to shift the dice. A hundred crowns Escape me every night! COUNT. Canst tell me whither? Not one of them has passed this wayâthe first Should come to me. RUDESTEIN. Two thousand crowns in debt! What needs this everlasting prate of payment? Hast not mine obligation for so much? Let that suffice. COUNT. 'Tis lean sufficiency; And yet, I fear it must. RUDESTEIN. Vouchers, what not! Indentures clerkly penned! on front and back Both seal and signature! COUNT. Wouldst spare thy wax? Then bring the crowns instead. I should be pleased With liquidation better than the bonds. RUDESTEIN. Dost doubt mine honor, Count? COUNT. No whit beyond Thy means and willâthey all are much alike. RUDESTEIN. Speak out! no mysteries!âay or no, at once? COUNT. I do not doubt if thou be drunk or sober. But first this honor singly:âlet us say Some creditor should seem incredulousâ How then? RUDESTEIN. He might receive of neither kindâ Nor gold nor pledgeâand yet not lack his payment. COUNT. Why thou preposterous puttoc! what dost blink at? Canst not distinguish me from Screitch?âthine honor! With left hand gently tapped against its hiltâ That ancient household scowl, and eye askance, Grinning like Roland in the needlework! Hast lost both wits and money?ânay, not moneyâ Not gold, but obligations! RUDESTEIN. Ay. COUNT. Wouldst hear How is it that I win them? RUDESTEIN. Prithee say. The secret had been better worth my care A month ago; but stillâthis sleightâhow is it? How dost thou change the balls? COUNT. Dost doubt my honor? 'Twere better make this devil thy better friend, Or spare to tell me so. RUDESTEIN. He has his choice. I fear no mysteries! plucked and trussed by one, Then roasted by the other! COUNT. We should find The bird at last but little worth our pains: A sort of bastard hawkâhalf owl, half cuckoo. Get hence to roost! I will not lose my time Preparing scarecrows for some garden's gallows. Go, sleep this bravery off! RUDESTEIN. Were the dice honest? First tell me what was promised me. COUNT. To-morrow: Let us not quarrel here. Thou wilt sleep sounder Without a bloody napkin at thy flank. What mountebank has missed his foolâthat risks More than he ever had, in hopes to win More than he ever will haveâso is angry? Bah! get to bed. RUDESTEIN. Give me this secret first. COUNT. Lose all thou hast, the reckoning is but short: Thy two alternate suits, one on, one offâ A borrowed horse at pawnâa serving man, Paid, fed, and liveried at the Baron's chargeâ Three bows, some shafts, an ill-spliced fishing-rodâ And that hereditary sword to tap at! Thus armed against misfortune, why shouldst fear her? RUDESTEIN. I fear no fortune, Count, but trust elsewhere! The sword is mine at leastâwouldst see it naked? (Draws.) No shifts, no mysteriesâdaylight suits me best, But pull its fellow from thy sideâout with it! Try which is pointed sharpest. COUNT. Thou wouldst swear The devil was on my part againâseeing doubleâ Two swords for one. RUDESTEIN. I care not if I do, Unless the second were the abler soldier. COUNT. Wait till to-morrow come. RUDESTEIN. I thought so! wait! To-morrow's reservations may discern 'Twixt Counts and gentlemen. I would at once Discharge these bonds, and set my vouchers free: But noâ'twere better wait, and fight to-morrow! Come, try a fairer game, and look about thee! COUNT. My luck is quite as good as thisâat least It used to be. (They fight. Rudestein is disarmed as Weilenberg and Servants enter.) WEILENBERG. Rudestein, stand offâget back!â What drunken brawls are these?âbegone I say! Give me his sword, Count Albert. COUNT. Willingly. It is a drunkard's brawlâbut I, being sober, Have striven to keep the peace. His sword was out, And mine, preventing mischief, took it from him. RUDESTEIN. Lend it an hour to-morrow? COUNT. Ay, a month. RUDESTEIN. His father slew mine uncle! WEILENBERG. What of that? COUNT. Who told thee so? RUDESTEIN. It was my kinsman here. Our blood lies on the groundâbut what of that? Why, faith, not muchânor less to him than me. I had forgotten itâhe remembers better. But what of that? It is a mystery! We will make plain to-morrow what it is. WEILENBERG. The clearance must begin with me. RUDESTEIN. With bothâ The devil to boot! Let me stand steadilyâ Daylight and eyesight! What care I for uncles? 'Twas he reminded me. WEILENBERG. Get hence to bed! Take him away. RUDESTEIN. Our blood lies on the ground! But what of that? (Servants force Rudestein out.) WEILENBERG. Such pastimes, Count, are perilous, And ill adjusted to the hour. COUNT. They are so: But he, not I, preferred themânor had either Much space for choice. WEILENBERG. This is, in part, my faultâ And yet I scarce know it how is. Forgive If nearer cares have spoilt us here as hosts. Your highness sees our strait. COUNT. I do, and blush To find my present haste my best excuse That, needing one so long, the time is lost In which to choose a better. WEILENBERG. Let us wait Till happier hours shall make my shame the less, For grace so ill requited and deservedâ When grief and dread have left us all. COUNT. To-night? Will the gates let me out? WEILENBERG. To-morrow they will. COUNT. Forgetful as I was, and wished to be, There scarce required so hot a summoner As this contentious kinsman with his sword. WEILENBERG. By him I sent no summons. COUNT. Then he was Precipitate as studious how to please; Gleaning the sheaf of sense from straws dispersed; Made apt by hintsâSomething he said just now Of blood between our houses. WEILENBERG. Wellâwhat then? COUNT. Ay, truly; what of that?âwords dropped by chanceâ No matter what! Being drunk, the babbler spilt This new suggestion of his uncle's death. He let good counsel leak. WEILENBERG. He did not drink With me to-day, nor will I halve his quarrel. COUNT. You watched its issue near at hand, my lord: You and your servants might have interposed A step too late, had I been a loser in it. But what of that? WEILENBERG. You credit what you speak? Or is it said in haste, Count? COUNT. I believe That such close watchers watched expectingly. What did they hide for else? WEILENBERG. I have been rash: Shame on mine age, I may be so again. But now my blood is cool enough. You have No present power to quicken it. COUNT. He liedâ This kinsman lied, then? If he did, it was Before your face. He spoke of blood between us: The morning's lesson was not taught for mirth. Who chid his ill remembrance? WEILENBERG. I did, sir. He is my kinsmanâoften to my hurt: Most men have one, at least, for whom they blush. He talked to-day in honour of your graceâ Would make us kinâsupposed alliances. I spurned at trash like this; but not that peace Resumes its trust. COUNT. As shame is young and bashful, It should have blushed to hide amongst these knaves, And harken how a drunkard's task might speed. WEILENBERG. Count, for myself, at all times else but this, I shall not lack an answer when I need one. COUNT. Take time to find a betterâthis is naught. WEILENBERG. My servants love their mistress, nor would break The sleep which wakes, at most, but once again. Their silence was not taught them: what they feared, Was what they harkened for. Nor they nor I Expected brawls to-night.âWho waits? bring lights: Ulrick; tread softly! bear them with his highness. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Chamber. Screitch and Barbara. BARBARA. Who stepped between the quarrellers first? SCREITCH. Not I. It is a foolish thing to mix with quarrelsâ Wait ever till they end. The time for peace Is after strife, when men will honour reason. But while the swords are out, the ears are heedless; I never meddle then. BARBARA. Methinks thou art Less apt for war than council, Screitchâbeing agÃ¨d. SCREITCH. Believe me, no. BARBARA. Indeed? SCREITCH. I thought to fight A great deal once. BARBARA. Didst think of fighting much, Or much of fighting? He who thinks so greatly Before he fights, may fight at last but little. Whom didst thou quarrel with, and what about? SCREITCH. With Rudestein, and about thyself. BARBARA. Alas! But wherefore didst not fight him, then? SCREITCH. Because I thought that strife might yield thee no great praiseâ And me still less. It argues prideâpride, folly. BARBARA. Wellâthis is wise! SCREITCH. The wise leave well alone. BARBARA. Perfect on both sides, bearing and forbearing! I would not have thee fight. SCREITCH. Lest he should slay me? BARBARA. Fie! any fools may fight with swords who wear them. But why should wisdom cast her harness off, Weapons of proof and ancient masteryâ Or bare the reverend crown to blows? SCREITCH. So far This Rudestein's brains are safe enough, beyond The chance of lessening. Why does Barbara yield Her company to the sot? BARBARA. Didst not conspire so? To bridle lips which else might bruit abroad The love I bear thee? SCREITCH. Dost thou love me, Bab? BARBARA. Not I. SCREITCH. Ah, ah! BARBARA. Well, was it not agreed? SCREITCH. It wasâbut look, thy mistress leaves at last. In this I make my comfort. Bab, henceforth, Lives free to love and wedlock. BARBARA. I lose my mistress! SCREITCH. Thou shalt gain patience by mine aid: we two Will read what Rusmundanus lately left us, Myself interpreting the tongue. BARBARA. On patience? 'Twere better after marriage, when we need it. Teach Rudestein patience, too, for charity: He will lose all. SCREITCH. I yield the crowns he hathâ And horse; but lend no more. BARBARA. He may not ask; Else were it good to grant them him. SCREITCH. Why so? BARBARA. To prove whose state is happiest, wealthiest, wisest, Thine own, or his. To justify my choice. SCREITCH. The debt grows great, as love and reverence lessen. At first, his suit was urged with modesty. Himself he likened, then, to Philip's sonâ Me to the Stagyrite. BARBARA. He owns thee wiser. SCREITCH. I mean to prove his judgment right in this, And lend no more. BARBARA. Thus is advantage maimed! So must I suffer both ways! SCREITCH. How? BARBARA. There be Dues pertinent to wedlockâHymen's offeringsâ Rings, ear-rings, bracelets, buckles, stomachers, With chains of gold, and mantles made of fur. All these do suitors tender on their knees, And we, the sought, receive in gentleness. Thou, pressed by graver cares, art slack and slow; Rudestein, meanwhile, is poor withal. Through him Who hunts thy venison for thee, toil is spared. Do thou provide fit instruments for the chase, And send him duly furnishedâelse I look Direct to thee. SCREITCH. Well, do so. I will bring thee Gifts far beyond the worth of purest goldâ Wisdom, good sooth, which is a crown of glory, And meekness for a chain about thy neck; Chaste thoughts shall be thy stomacher, and love Thy mantle lined with fur! Come, kiss me, Barbara. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Anti-room to the Chamber of the Baroness. Ellen and Ursula. URSULA. Barbara is stirring; so is Screitchâbut he Is swift beyond my speed: his wisdom soars Past hope of following. ELLEN. Were they swords we heard? URSULA. Have they disturbed my lady? ELLEN. Noânot much: She stirred, but sleeps again. I pray thee, Ursula, Whence came those cries? URSULA. A drunken battle fought By two main friends when sober. ELLEN. Drunk to-night? URSULA. Ay, Rudestein every night: Count Albert's brains Are not so thin as his by half. ELLEN. The Count? URSULA. Trust me thus farâthat face of thine has lost More blood than both the combatants. Cheer up! 'Twas pale enough before. Alas, poor bird! I fright thee, flutterer! These have done no harm. Speak now, what ails thee? ELLEN. Was my father there? URSULA. He was, they say; but all are now dispersed. My lady stirred, but did not wake? Such sleep, A month ago, had saved her! ELLEN. Quarrel to-night! URSULA. Behold their reverence for the house of death! ELLEN. My mother's face is darker than it was? URSULA. It is the lamp which changes. Let me watch. ELLEN. I cannot sleep again. URSULA. Hast slept at all? ELLEN. Till these tongues woke meâlike a careless nurse, I slept and dreamed. URSULA. What didst thou dream about? ELLEN. Of what my mother told meâof my brothers. Hast ever thought on death as near thee, Ursula? I never did till now. URSULA. He is not near thee. ELLEN. But should we fear believing that he is? URSULA. A footstep!âhark, child! (Enter Weilenberg.) WEILENBERG. Does thy mistress sleep? URSULA. She has slept well till now, my lord. ELLEN. Look in. [Exit Ursula. WEILENBERG. I woke her, then? ELLEN. She stirred awhile ago. WEILENBERG. Is she in bed? ELLEN. She will not rest in bed. The couch is easier, and it may be moved. Such changes give her ease. URSULA re-enters. She is awake, And asks to see your lordship. [Exit Weilenberg. ELLEN. He looks faint. Would God my mother's peace might reach to him! URSULA. Men want humility, so suffer more. The pride which wars with nature may prevail; But she, though conquered, will not lack revenge. His daughter hath a share of it. ELLEN. Of pride?â The saints forbid! URSULA. Some tears would do her good. Would she not rather that their hindrance choked her, Than spend them on this Count? ELLEN. Ay, would she, Ursula. If every drop retained were fire, she would. Tears for a mother dyingâand for him! Cruel to mock me now! (Enter Barbara.) URSULA. Barbara, awake! BARBARA. Tears!âis my lady dead? URSULA. Tread carefully. BARBARA. There is no rest to-night: I must not sleep: This Count pursues me round the house with prayers. I dare not go to bed, lest he should follow! He kneels before meâhighness as he is! URSULA. Is he not soberer yet? BARBARA. Who? URSULA. What dost seek? BARBARA. Count Albert soberer?âhas he been otherwise? URSULA. Prithee, begoneâwhat is the Count to us? BARBARA. My lord is angry, and, I hear, unjust. ELLEN. Go somewhere else! I shall think worse of both. BARBARA. He fears soâthis it is which makes him mad! The strife was not his seekingâso he saysâ He swears itâyet my lord will chase him forth. URSULA. Bethink thee who may hear thee! BARBARA. Who? URSULA. My lord. BARBARA. He is not here? URSULA. He is. BARBARA. Then mercy, Ursula! This crazy Count will follow me, if we stay! URSULA. He will not dare! He must be crazed, indeed! ELLEN. You fright me, Barbara! He will not come here? BARBARA. His summons was to quit at break of day; And he will see you firstâif nowhere else, Why here he will. URSULA. He dares not! BARBARA. Heaven forbid That while their tempers are so fell and spiteful, My lord may find him here. What here!âgood saints, We shall have swords again! ELLEN. Barbara, where is he? Make haste to find him!âUrsula, come with me. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Chamber of the Baroness. Baron Weilenberg, and Baroness, on a Couch. BARONESS. Her cheeks have lost their freshness: I could wish This watching, night by night, were well at end; But now to thrust her back would fret impatienceâ I must not do it now. WEILENBERG. Keep her beside thee. She will be easier so, happier hereafter. Let us not both abhor ourselves. BARONESS. Let neither Think otherwise than peacefully of one Who is at peace. WEILENBERG. At lastâbut it was late! BARONESS. Let me die thankfully: I will believe That both have ever loved me. WEILENBERG. There have been These twenty years for me to tell thee soâ It were but mockery now! BARONESS. Peace, Weilenberg! WEILENBERG. I do not ask it. Peace returns no moreâ While here, at least, may God forbid it should! BARONESS. I wished a parting easier to us both. WEILENBERG. Forgive me, thenâI know thou wiltâthou hast Daily these twenty years! Had love been less, I should have made thee so much less unhappy. Once more forgive me! BARONESS. Never for an hour Did I retain the privilege to forgive. WEILENBERG. Yet say so. BARONESS. Ay, with all my heart I say it. What else was prayed for has been granted me; And much I dared not ask. But trust this child! Thou hast no power to make her love thee less; Trust her, for my sake, and believe her love. Our other children call their mother hence. This innocent girl is wiser than she seems, And will re-place us all. Now promise me! WEILENBERG. To promise that were one more injury. How should I trust her love who doubted thine? BARONESS. It is the last thing asked of thee! WEILENBERG. I promise! BARONESS. God grant his peace to both! Now send me Ursula, And leave me till to-morrow. I would sleep. SCENE V. Night.âCastle Hall. Count Albert, Ellen, Ursula, and Barbara. COUNT. This goodness brings me health again: I see That all are not unjust. ELLEN. Your highness sought me? COUNT. Ay, so I didâbut not these witnesses. URSULA. We have our cares elsewhere, and must go hence. COUNT. Ay, do so, mistress Ursulaâfare thee well! ELLEN. She stays as long as I do. COUNT. Hear me, Ellen! ELLEN. Then speakâwe may not tarry here. COUNT. Nor I. Has Barbara told you that I must be gone? Because I would not yield my throat to murder, But lightly took a drunkard's sword away, Must part at dawn from Rolandseck? ELLEN. The need Hardly foreruns another stronger still. My father's wishes are mine too. COUNT. Then needs it That you and he should think alike in this? ELLEN. It is becoming that we should. COUNT. That both Refuse to hear meâprove alike unjust? ELLEN. He is not so. COUNT. Nay, if in all things else, Why not in this? ELLEN. Who tells me that he is? COUNT. This change to frowns is needless, at the least. He drives me hence, and asks me why I tarriedâ But justly you cannot. URSULA. We shall be missed! COUNT. Promise me justiceâall may ask for that. ELLEN. I will not doubt the honor of your highnessâ If I shall pledge me farther than is asked, Promise in turn to leave without offence. COUNT. I do. ELLEN. To part from Rolandseck? COUNT. Twice promised. ELLEN. I will think justly, if I mayâI must Think kindly of your grace. That which was earned In happier hours, shall be my care to cherish. My peace requires so much: is this enough? COUNT. Enough to make me happier! You shall guide me. I will be patient, grateful,âwhat you please. ELLEN. Then point not misery sharper than it is. Do I lack patience less? COUNT. You have my pledge. We shall be happier when we meet hereafter. Let these two stand as witnesses. ELLEN. Of what? COUNT. My vows and yoursâof faith and love between us. Give me that hand. ELLEN. I never will, Count Albert. It is not said in anger, nor in haste. There is a mightier witness hears me too. I never will! We part without reproach; But, by his truth, one roofâwith my consentâ Shall never shelter both of us again. [Exeunt Ellen, Ursula, and Barbara. COUNT. Only a moment! Bless this little fool! She has made me a great one. Fade, ye willows! Now for a brook and garland! [Exit. SCENE VI. Chamber in the Castle. Rudestein and Barbara. RUDESTEIN. I will not see him till we meet elsewhere: Now prithee go and say so. BARBARA. To the rash, Wine is less perilous in its fumes at night, Than in its fogs to-morrow, child. It is The morning's fermentation that o'erthrows theeâ What Screitch calls crapula: hence desperate pride, Crazed pertinacity in wrongâor worse, Headlong repentance that exasperates sin, But never tarries long enough to mend. RUDESTEIN. We are not married yet, so peace! BARBARA. 'Tis well! Do thou and Screitch resign prÃ«occupanceâ This Count shall have my heart. RUDESTEIN. I yield my share. BARBARA. He soars above hate's archery and its cries, On wings proportioned to the weight they carry. Such grief as love's disasters, loss of friends, Or hoped alliance set asideâat most Flash some brief sparkles from his eyes, compress His lips a little closer, tinge his paleness, And shape his smiles the sharper. Sour or sorry He never seems, and least when most perplexed. RUDESTEIN. What ring dost rub and breathe upon? BARBARA. It is A gift, and not from Screitch. RUDESTEIN. Who gave itâhe? BARBARA. Dost see the little lamp a-blaze within? Look! look!âNay, hand and allâlet those sick eyes Draw lustre from it. RUDESTEIN. Babbler, was it his? BARBARA. Brawler, wilt fight with me? Let go, I say, And hear its history. It was the Count's: Ellen's it should have been, but fell to me. He gave it with a kiss. See how he mourns, Man's moods, and mortal mutabilities! Thou first didst quarrel with thy friendâand next, The Baron with his son-in-lawâand last, The gentle Ellen bade her love farewell! After the clock had stricken twelve last night, Thy crowns, his baronies, her favour, vanished: At one, his heart and brains were cool as ever; He kissed, and gave me this. RUDESTEIN. What said he since? BARBARA. Just now? RUDESTEIN. Ay, half an hour ago. BARBARA. He said He would come hither straight. RUDESTEIN. For what? BARBARA. Ask him. He bade me nurse thee, boil a posset for thee, Give thee a single flask of weakest wine, Put thee in temper, make thee wise and social, Then say that he will fight with thee no more. Lo! here he isâso peace. [Exit Barbara. (Enter Count.) RUDESTEIN. There scarce is time, Count Albert, for regrets. Last night, believe me, I was half drunk. COUNT. Believe me, thou wast quite. Why, I was half, nor did we drink alike. RUDESTEIN. Your highness was not ruined tooâat least We differ in this. COUNT. Faith, but I was! ask Barbara: As surely so as she is, by your doings! Past help, or hope, like her! Canst tell me whyâ Unless we needs must quarrel yet againâ These losses should afflict thee thus? RUDESTEIN. I have At present for their payment but the promise That sometime I will pay. COUNT. This is the growl Of thunder in the sunshine, long and low, So far away. Now that the storm is passed, Behold the rainbow! Let us talk awhile Wisely, as we were used to do. This sometime, Which shall eat up all promises at last, As Saturn ate his babes, though stones in hardness, How near dost think it is? Since yesterday My rights are mine by luck, and law, and battleâ Two thousand crowns are trebly due to me. Canst give a tithe in earnest of the whole? Canst find two score? RUDESTEIN. I may hereafter, perhaps. COUNT. Ay, doubtlessâor a dukedom! look about! Perhaps does, indeed, brings strangest things to pass! The imperial crown itself is findableâ All possibilities we grant. Such men As thou have been made popes. Bestir thyself! Awake! who knows? RUDESTEIN. What would your highness have? COUNT. Thine aid, thy brains, thy fellowship, and Ellen. And thou shalt have these vouchers back again; Two thousand crowns to boot. RUDESTEIN. My life is yours! COUNT. When will these yeasty wits have purged themselves? I must not wait thine head-ache. RUDESTEIN. It is gone. Haply this quarrel may be turned to use: We thrive but ill as friends. Before last night, My footing here was slippery at the best: Yet can I help no longer than I keep it. We may be better credited apart. COUNT. Alas, a day too late! I must be gone. It is a day too late! (bells tolls.) What bell is that? RUDESTEIN. Hark! from the chapel! 'tis the passing bellâ My cousin's farewell to a graceless world! COUNT. There is another farther offâdost hear it? RUDESTEIN. These nuns have waked their loudest. Every knee, Within a league, is bent but yours and mine. If prayers and sighs may waft a soul to bliss, Hers will not lack a gale. COUNT. Lend thine aid tooâ She was no kin to me. RUDESTEIN. She might have been, But would not wait. COUNT. Had death come yesterday, He might have turned me out, and saved offenceâ Saved us our last night's buffetâspared my sighsâ Left me the baron's debtor and his daughter'sâ Who must not find me here. RUDESTEIN. These bells still tolling, He scarce would feel a tug upon his beard. COUNT. I hope to find a time for giving that When he shall feel. RUDESTEIN. Our little Countess pouts? What did she say last night? COUNT. She has her caresâ She will think justly, kindly. RUDESTEIN. Good! all good! COUNT. I thought so too, and gave my promise bravely: Therefore she wishes me a long adieuâ Thenceforth she has renounced me! RUDESTEIN. Was it thus? COUNT. Bear witness that it was, her own saint Ursula, And thy saint Barbara! It was gravely thus! Majestically thus! RUDESTEIN. My pretty cousin! Last leaf above the rotten root of Roland! Our crabstock keeps its savour still! COUNT. The puppet! A bright-eyed laughter-loving simpleton, With rosier cheeks than Hebe's six weeks back! Now would she change their hue for Cynthia's paleness While he, who slept at Latmos, woke at last To wonder that the stars were almost gone, And feebly lighted by her waning moon. RUDESTEIN. The ill-digested wine has made me sadâ Or else, belike, this chapel-bell afflicts me! Pains plague the Sacristan! The stomach's qualms, And qualms of conscience are so near alike, I scarce know which is which. It rings the passing Of one who, though in thought she loved me little, Was little less, in deed, my friend for thatâ Quenching hot wrath, and covering frailties. Beside, she lent some crowns without a bond. She kept no vouchers, Count. COUNT. Till late last night My dreams were ever bestial! RUDESTEIN. What about? COUNT. Of flowery pastures, with this milk-white lamb, In which to graze at largeâthe bride, nor less The barony. But love prevails at last! Love pure as Tancred's, when he fought too well. Those cheeks must blush again, those eyes must sparkle, And laughter light upon those lipsâor else I rest no more. RUDESTEIN. We have a ready road To such repose, but rough withal. COUNT. Which way? Wilt follow? RUDESTEIN. Will your highness follow me? I should go firstâit suits a soldier's step: The politician's were a pace too slow. There is no danger but in drawing back. COUNT. Keep honor from beneath our feet, and then Which way you will. RUDESTEIN. Who bars us after reckonings? COUNT. I may do what I canâand what I wish I will do when I can, and how I can, With this brief reservation. Power content To rest unquestioned, smiles on me. RUDESTEIN. Whyâso I would be Emperor yet ere Lammas day: And in my realm there should be Empresses More numerous than the walnut trees! Pledge that, And I will give thee, for a summer grange, This castle where we areâits parks for sportâ Its farms for sustenanceâmy cousin's lordshipâ Old Roland's fortress for a hunting-lodge. Screitch shall be seneschal, and father Philip Thy guide to peace. COUNT. How soon? RUDESTEIN. Stay while I count. John Baptist's martyrdom comes Thursday next: Thou shalt sup here, then, on John Baptist's eveâ As heir, if this suffice and please thee best, Or else as lord. COUNT. Wooing the good old way, With shield and spear, Achilles-likeâor how? But what says honor? RUDESTEIN. Honor sees us chased Like dogs, to-day, with scourges at their tails: And honor will but laugh if, three days hence, We chase the scourger. Mount, sir, and look sad! Your highness tarries here too long. COUNT. I quit Both house and wife; do thou take care of them. RUDESTEIN. It is a two day's charge. COUNT. Where shall we meet? RUDESTEIN. Where the brook widens at the forest side: Look for me there at sunset. Now, adieu! SCENE VII. Chamber in the Castle. Baron Weilenberg and Father Philip. PHILIP. Self-tyranny in excess provokes rebellion: The ill-conquered spirit will break off its chains, And rage still worse! Remorse is surfeit's leech, Easing, by pain, the hot heart's plethora. Impatience we prohibitânot remorse; But gladly bid God-speed where grief is humble. For if she may do nothing by herself, Like faith who can do nothingâyet without her, Repentance never comes, nor that late peace With healthful tears half-dried upon her cheekâ Whose stern apparitor must sweep the house. WEILENBERG. Thou seest how dark it is, but not how foul! PHILIP. He sees it better still who pities allâ How mixed and moody, mad and miserable, Yet how mysterious are we tooâas good Till self-depraved, and may be good again. Our daily nature seems unnatural Once every day at least. He that would burn A metropolitan city in his wrath, To-morrow scatters crumbs before the birds. Use thou her scales to weigh thyselfâwho knew So well, yet loved so greatly. WEILENBERG. She forgave; The dying lamb complains not! With its breath No bleatings pass to shame the slaughterer! This damns an earlier murder. PHILIP. What, in war? War is not murder! Oft the strong are gentle, And iron-handed soldiership forbears, While palms, which might be peaceful, itch for vengeance. All should thus look on strifeâbut while some love it, The rest must learn it, and are justified. WEILENBERG. There is a curse called down upon myself By cursing lighter sins in other men. Answer as he should do whose office awes him, Speak, servant of the persecutedâthouâ Canst thou absolve it? PHILIP. Lord of Weilenberg, I need no adjurations! In His name, I say there is forgiveness. WEILENBERG. What! for murderers? PHILIP. Why else were murderers prayed for? Whom hast slain? WEILENBERG. A tyrant for his tyranny, and now The meek for being such! PHILIP. What tyrant was it? WEILENBERG. A fellow-soldier in the field when young, Ill-joined by common friends and services. One tent sufficed us, followed by one page, A widow's child, sickly and slow, but patient: Studious to please, he would have served alike, But loved the harshest least. Wretch, if he erred, It was through dread, when threats extorted tears, And tears provoked to stripes again! He grew Helpless through blowsâwas scourged for being helpless! I found him thus, and smote the murderer. We foughtâbehold the avenger! who consumed In doing that which he, at least, did brieflyâ These twenty years! PHILIP. The curses of our youth, Like arrows shot toward Heaven, at last fall down, To light upon our age! Peace be with bothâ For lo, a better comforter! (Exit Philip. Enter Ellen.) ELLEN. My father! WEILENBERG. Dost ask me for thy mother, child?âShe is Not as we are, but happy. She rests now! ELLEN. I should not be unhappy, were you not. WEILENBERG. You did not help to make her miserable. ELLEN. She bade us think her happyâand I do so. WEILENBERG. She is escapedâat least thank God for that. One of the two is free!âbut art not fearful? ELLEN. Of whom? WEILENBERG. Of meâthou hast none else to fear. ELLEN. What have I done? WEILENBERG. Why, what she did,âendured, And hid thy tears. ELLEN. You do affright me now! WEILENBERG. I have begun in timeâthrough me were lost A mother and a lover since the dawn! ELLEN. Let me but try to make my father happy, And I will love none else. WEILENBERG. How shouldst thou love me? ELLEN. Pray, father, for her sake grant this! It is The first prayer in her name! WEILENBERG. It was her last! ELLEN. Will you reject us both, then? WEILENBERG. Try to love me! Remind me daily of my vows last night. Teach me humility. I would excuse What must seem cruel, done at such a time. Let sorrow conquer shame, and both speak plainlyâ Count Albert's heart is harder than mine own! I never could have mingled wine with death, And drunken brawls with misery. ELLEN. I did not wait Till this was told me. WEILENBERG. Did not wait for what? I cause these tears! ELLEN. They are the last for him. Count Albert knows we shall not meet again. Before my mother died, I told him so. WEILENBERG. It is a vow which death has witnessed, then! Didst wish to see me less unhappy, Ellen? I am so now. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Chamber. Barbara bearing a large charger of silverâand Screitch. BARBARA. She sends me back to thank thee for thy love, But will not taste thy poly-balsamum:â Scarce she endures its sight. SCREITCH. Why not?âshe must! BARBARA. She would for thy sake, but she cannot, eat. SCREITCH. Months have been spared for study on the mess; Books searched by candle-light to make it healthfulâ But, lo, 'tis perfected a day too late! The lips are cold for which I toiled so much! Let her but taste it, Barbara. BARBARA. She abhors it. The will is with thee, but the sense eschews. SCREITCH. Didst thou recount its properties? BARBARA. At large; The just proportions might o'ertask my skill; But yet I named the meats. A molewarp brayed. A coney's kidneys stewed with juniper. The brain and fat of peacocks chased to falling. A running capon's legs; and swallow's oil. But chief the goat with no white hair about himâ His gall, his tongue, his marrow. SCREITCH. These for strength. BARBARA. A hedge-pig's lights and bristles; fennel, tansy, With ambergris, and yeast. SCREITCH. To quicken lifeâ Its spur and sharp propulsion. BARBARA. Gillyflowers. Hops plucked before the night-dews leave their clusters. Eft's eyes, dried cray-fish shells, and blindworm's eggs; With twelve white pebbles gathered from the brook When Sol declines from Scorpio. SCREITCH. What I missed Was moss from off a dead man's skull unburied, But trust I found the equivalent. BARBARA. She thanks thee. Such pains deserve so much, at least.âBut meats Which should have helped thy pottage heal her mother, How shall their virtues profit her? SCREITCH. The branch Is parcel of the tree, though broken from itâ The flower is nourished as its stalk. In this I worked with Nature heedfully, and mixed Dried thistle-beards, and pounded columbine, Seeds from the sunflower, and a rock-dove's trail. BARBARA. I saw thee chase a porker round about, And fight the ram, by moonlight, for his horns; No cost was spared! SCREITCH. I grudge nor toil nor chargeâ But needs must grieve that both are profitless! BARBARA. It grieves her more to seem unthankful toward thee. SCREITCH. 'Tis pity next to sin we waste it thus! BARBARA. Set by the charger till her loathing leave her. SCREITCH. I may not, child! The moon will wane at eve: Our herbs change with her from their wholesomeness. Who eats must make good speed. Bring spoons and napkinsâ We two will profit wisely by mischance. That vessel's sides are warmed with lusty health, And many days. BARBARA. To make our numbers equal, Thou shalt eat threefold more than I. SCREITCH. I will. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Border of a forest, with a brook in front. The Castle seen at some distance, backed by mountains. Count and Rudestein, meeting. RUDESTEIN. So far on foot? Stand back a little, Countâ A little farther, prithee, in the shade! That buckle on thy belt is seen a mileâ Or some such glitterer flashed the sunbeams off it, Ere I had reached midway. The time was sunset, But love outruns his promises. COUNT. Hast seen This widowed kinsman since his loss last night? RUDESTEIN. Doubtless I have, with proffered services. COUNT. What said he? RUDESTEIN. Not one word. COUNT. A fair escape! Grief tames the tamer. RUDESTEIN. As a she-wolf softens Unmilked since yesterday, whose cub is missing. I might have guessed the meaning of that scowl, If Screitch had held his peace. COUNT. Interpret it. RUDESTEIN. The dead must first be buriedâthen farewell To him and Rolandseck! Your highness keeps Some kinsman sleek at home to carve the meat, Draw off too tight a boot on hunting days, Or see the hawks well trained and wisely tended? The basest things serve best for common use. When state dismounts, and lays its housings by, A sheep-skin feels as soft. We ease your heels, And save the cost of boot-jacks. COUNT. Now, the moral? RUDESTEIN. I will not yield to eldership. I have No house but this. If one of us must quit, He can provide another, I cannot. Here dwelt mine ancestors, and I dwell here. COUNT. John Baptist's Martyrdom comes Thursday next! RUDESTEIN. No matter which is master, he or thou, Here will I build my nest. COUNT. Thou shalt. RUDESTEIN. I will. Our scuffle might have maimed the spirit's wings! COUNT. When will begin these obsequies? RUDESTEIN. To-morrow. At dawn the day which follows will begin This quittance that we wot of. COUNT. Not to-morrow? RUDESTEIN. We bear our dead no farther than the church, And leave them near the altar. Custom asks A ten days sepulture beside and after. Requiems are chaunted for the soul enlarged, Alms are dispensed, and masses multiplied. Religion perfects all her offices Ere shuts its mouth the pavement underneath. COUNT. Thy living lease at Rolandseck is less By just nine days to one. RUDESTEIN. I will not quit! Your highness is content to bide down here? Small faith in scaling ladders, Count, and swords Are sharp above. COUNT. My courage, matched with thine, Falls short a flask and half to-day. RUDESTEIN. If both Were fairly on the outside of the moat, We should be special climbers, or remain there. When will your highness take the equivalent, And give me back my bonds? COUNT. On Thursday next. RUDESTEIN. Then come to-morrow nightâbring companyâ As many friends and servants as you please. Let them not lose their stomachs by the way, And I will find the feast. COUNT. Nay, not to-morrow. RUDESTEIN. Then not at all. COUNT. It is Death's festivalâ I would not drink to Venus from the bowl Prepared for grief by him! RUDESTEIN. Well, we are quits. Behold, the effects we sealed upon are tenderedâ Revenge and Rolandseck with love and Ellen! Make ample riddance, and release the debtâ I do my part. COUNT. Dost grace these obsequies? RUDESTEIN. Not Iâmy duty aggravates offenceâ That stare was all its thanks. COUNT. Will Ellen be there? RUDESTEIN. Ellen will not be there; her father will. COUNT. Art sure? RUDESTEIN. Screitch says so, Philip, Barbaraâ She will not followâwomen are exempt. What hare is this a-foot we must not hoot at While doubt holds back the dogs? COUNT. We might shut up The mourners with their dead, were all togetherâ Lock the church doors behind them? RUDESTEIN. Bravely, Count! 'Midst all thy scruples, keep an eye to thrift! So might we save a second ceremonyâ Hold priest and people, bride and father ready! But woe the while! Our coupling, to be perfect, Wants just one-halfâEllen will not be there! COUNT. How is this church defended?âfourscore spears Might hunt the ancient otter in his isle? RUDESTEIN. Beside the generations sprung from Rolandâ His bones and theirsâtime, sanctity, remorseâ It will be garrisoned with flesh and blood Out-numbering fourscore spearmen four to one. Blind, deaf, maimed, crippled scarce may bide at home In twenty miles to-morrow! All her children Will mourn this mother of the miserable. They may not think to fight, indeedâbut oft Men fight the better for the want of thinking. Nor will a part lack armsâWhat! Sacrilege! True thou art skilful, valiant, fortunateâ As fresh as Mercury, and as light of footâ But spare to tempt this elder nevertheless: If thou must strike at all, strike first. COUNT. Not I. RUDESTEIN. Thou shalt fight none but Ellen, then. COUNT. There needs Long wings or ladders for a war with her. RUDESTEIN. The gates may let thee in, while Bab and I Do stand as porters to an empty house. COUNT. This song seems inspiration! RUDESTEIN. Fie, Count, fie! Repent the trespassing on sacred things! Let churches be! The child secures the sireâ And she bides there with meâa man disgracedâ A man put out of office! reprobate! And left behind as naught! By twos and threes, On foot and horseback, bring the best thou hast; Then tarry here till twilight. COUNT. Wellâwhat next? How shall we hide their weapons? RUDESTEIN. Yeomen's weapons! They need not hide them! Hundreds like themselves Will don such gear, and come as colts new harnessed. A woodman's crates may hide the better sort. Only shun ostentation. Mixed or not With humbler gazers, let them trudge this way By twos and threesâdo thou keep out of sight. Death's march begins not till the sun goes down; Thou mayest discern its torches whence we stand. Hold fast awhileâgive time enoughâbe wary,â Fright not the ferrymen by over haste. COUNT. And then? RUDESTEIN. Mount to the gate, sir! What forbids? My gentle cousin needs a comforter. COUNT. If we might gain the ferry-boats as well, We should consummate! Sisters, mourners, idlersâ Old Roland's isle thronged threefold, like a warren, Must yield or starve! RUDESTEIN. I will provide for that. But softly, sirâthe praises of your graceâ A careless eye, an easy-gaited conscienceâ Are precious gifts, no doubtâbut qualifiedâ Good gifts, I say, indeedâbut dashed with worseâ Such be that goatish honor, horned and bearded, Which looks so grave, and stands almost on nothingâ Punctilious pride, fantastic fickleness! Your grace may quit as lightly as you came, And leaving me behind to pay the rent, Ride forth elsewhere. COUNT. At this time yesterday The baron's wine was on my lipâlast night He and his daughter warned me out of doors: Now am I free to enter how I can. RUDESTEIN. Thou wouldst get back again, and I would tarry. My choice is 'twixt provision with the birds, Or fire-side drinking and two thousand crowns. COUNT. Two thousand in the purse, and one paid yearly. RUDESTEIN. Good night, then, to your highness. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Chamber in the Castle. Ellen, Prioress, Ursula, and Father Philip. PHILIP. The Prioress and myself are so far trusted As not to break, or change, but perfect order. We regulate the ancient rites of deathâ This were in custom's teeth. PRIORESS. What, veiled as we! Wouldst follow like a masker to the grave? Is this the time's sobriety! Disguised To walk with us? PHILIP. We cannot grant this prayer. Better bethink thee, child, or ask my lord. URSULA. He marked, to-day, how pale she looks, and then Thanked heaven that no such duty rests with her. ELLEN. Either he would refuse me what I prayed, Or yielding, grieve the more. I will not ask. PHILIP. Five such processions to the place of rest I can myself rememberâScreitch counts moreâ The females of the house were never with us. PRIORESS. Daughter, have patience; let it be forgot. PHILIP. All prayers, if faithful, meet aboveâand thine Will rise as swift from hence. ELLEN. Must usage rule Both life and death? PHILIP. Ay, wherefore should she not? When might she cast her decent mantle o'er us If not to hide our tears? ELLEN. You will be just. I know not how to strive with both so wise, And I so ignorant. Have I seemed hard to govern? PHILIP. As little lawless as a lamb at play; Harder to catch than hold. The more I marvel That three of us conjoined may scarce prevail Where each did singly. URSULA. Ellen, be advisedâ In this the mother will direct thee best. ELLEN. My mother has directed!âif I live, I will be there. PRIORESS. Thou shouldst have told us so. Nay, God forbid our scruples! what she willed Is sacred now. URSULA. When did my lady say so? ELLEN. Last night. PRIORESS. The night before? ELLEN. It was last night. PRIORESS. Daughter, you dream! The saint had passed to rest. ELLEN. I did dream thenâhave patience with me both! Scarce three days back I was incredulous too. My little wisdom seemed enough for that. Last night I slept, but thought that she awoke me: Upon my cheek I felt the breath of life. âChild, thou must haste to follow me,â she saidâ Then raised, and led me out. The court was full; Thou, father, 'midst the choristers, wast there. Behind the bier, I followed next but one, She first, with eyes which often turned upon me. The prioress and a sister either side meâ All three were veiled, and habited alikeâ Like theirs, my feet were bare. I wondered not, Although the coffin and the corpse were present, That she, as if in life, walked on before us. While many thronged us, for the crowd was great, My cousin Rudestein plucked the veil aside, And I awoke. Now, shall I tell my father? PRIORESS. Thou hast a better guidance from above, Than his or ours. Happy indeed, if so! If she who rests appoint such raiment for thee, It must be thine till death. ELLEN. Lend it to-night. PRIORESS. Not for disguiseâin aid of artifice! 'Twere profanation of a sacred thing, And might hereafter arm reproach against us. This dream of death foreshadows death to sin; The grave of pomp; the peace which walks with us. Brother, what sayest? PHILIP. There shall be no pledge given Constraining conscience for the time to come. If this our benefactress willed it thus, Why should we doubt? The earth contains no place More sacred to us than a mother's grave. Thither she goes to weep, and thence returns Unnoticed by the gazers of the world. Enjoined or not, it is an innocent purpose: Nor does that veil conceal a meeker brow, Or purer bosom. PRIORESS. We may trust thee, Ursula? Thou wilt not whisper in licentious ears Of what we do? URSULA. I am no whisperer, mother. PRIORESS. Nor now, nor in the time to come? URSULA. I promise. PRIORESS. Till we release thee, Ursula? Take thou this, And hold it to thy lips. (Gives the Cross.) URSULA. I swear! what else? PHILIP. Tell it not Barbara, then. I would impute No worse than mirth too free, and wildly-scatteredâ Ill chosen timesâcompanions ill assorted. Shew kindness, lady, but not trust. URSULA. 'Tis easy To shut her out from partnership in griefâ She seeks not mourners. Ellen, we have heard Counsel like this before. PRIORESS. The time needs hasteâ We must provide fit garments for thee, child. Look, this has grieved thee, brother! Come with me. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Chamber. Rudestein and Barbara. BARBARA. Screitch sits in judgment on a suit thrice pleaded; Nor will he leave before the court is up. RUDESTEIN. What suit? BARBARA. On three stray pullets claimed by Gueldt, Which Schqueel defends. Our seneschal to-day Is powerful with his precedents, and cites The Pandects to the sow-ringer. RUDESTEIN. In Latin? BARBARA. Nay, they who profit by them know the best: The parties seem content. RUDESTEIN. Do both? BARBARA. All three. Wouldst smooth or sharpen when he comes? We have Scarce time to night for jealousy. RUDESTEIN. What else? BARBARA. Call home thy wits and answer me at once. I hate this butting head to head with questions! Art sick of soberness so soon? Art grieved To miss the time of day for getting drunk? Art frighted at thy policy? Art sure This second master may exceed the first? That he will trust us better, feed us better, Or how?âWhat dost thou muse about? RUDESTEIN. Bab! Bab! I have outrun temptation. BARBARA. Dost repent? I partly know its shapeâ'twas bandy-legged. One kind, at least, was swift enough to catch thee. RUDESTEIN. But that escaped was worst. BARBARA. Than treachery? RUDESTEIN. If treachery, who will profit by it? BARBARA. He. RUDESTEIN. Why, thouâ BARBARA. Whatâwhat? RUDESTEIN. His pocket pouncet-boxâ His brimstone comfit-case. BARBARA. Awake at last. RUDESTEIN. I do feel sick about this change of lords, Whilst thou canst chirp so cheerily. BARBARA. More need. RUDESTEIN. Barbara is hard of heart! BARBARA. Who made me so? Wilt let me tell thee what I think thou seemest? RUDESTEIN. Ayâwhat? BARBARA. A fish. RUDESTEIN. What sort of fish? BARBARA. The kind Which loses heart when dryâis out of breathâ Almost a coward if he cannot drink. RUDESTEIN. I hate these masters old and newâI love Good cheer and Rolandseck. BARBARA. And Barbara? RUDESTEIN. This Count will hold his promises, at first; And I shall hold his crowns. He hath snake's eyesâ A cockatrice's eyes replete with malice! The while we talked, last night, about this treason, He kept his right arm free and farthest off. BARBARA. This helped thee to outrun the fiend, belike? RUDESTEIN. I would have risked it, Bab, if sure of grace: Safe in my pardon here, I would have tried it! The bonds were in his pocket. BARBARA. Be content! RUDESTEIN. I would have done it, and avowed it too. It must have seemed fair play. Our peace was known To none beside thyselfâour hate and challenge To all the house. This would have shown a purposeâ A meeting predisposed by both of us. It is but waterish wisdom to provide A nursery for his grace at Rolandseck! BARBARA. Being next of kin thyself? RUDESTEIN. The next to Ellen. Their son, though younger, disinherits ours. Yet must this Count come in, to keep us here; And we must eat. BARBARA. Our road is perilous! RUDESTEIN. Nay, wherefore is it perilous, child? These lords Shall buffet with each otherâhe who breaks His neighbour's neck, saves mine. BARBARA. Now peace! 'tis Screitchâ Do thou speak loud, and look the other way. RUDESTEIN. His learning is enough without a wifeâ They ever spoil each other. He is old. BARBARA. I care notâhe is wise and peaceable. RUDESTEIN. Dost hate me, Barbara? BARBARA. Perhaps I love him best. Hush! hush! the SeneschalâIs judgment ended? SCREITCH. As thine is ended, simple one, it is. BARBARA. And how is that? SCREITCH. Discreetly, Barbara. Dost love the wisest best? BARBARA. Not I. SCREITCH. Hush! hush! BARBARA. Or if I do, which is he?âHast adjudged These fowls, and how? SCREITCH. I gave a bird to eachâ Each bears his costs. BARBARA. But there were three of them! SCREITCH. Our civil statute turns not right nor leftâ But harrows irrespectively and widely: Our cannon ploughs too deepâ BARBARA. What was thy sentence? SCREITCH. One bird he takes who lost the threeâit is Retrievement of his right when right availed not. He one who stole the threeâhis recompense For restitution of the two surrendered. The third remains with us. RUDESTEIN. Why so? She stands On level footing with the rest? SCREITCH. Being sole, She stopped the way to peace. RUDESTEIN. We have at hand A harder case. SCREITCH. Propound it simply then. RUDESTEIN. Suppose two claimants, and a single pullet? SCREITCH. The owner takes her. RUDESTEIN. He must be declared. Stand forth between us, Barbaraâdost behold? While all dwell here, she may be neutral, commonâ To neither pertinent, or bothâbut soon I shall go hence. SCREITCH. She tarries, if she will. RUDESTEIN. The choice is hers, thenâif she will, she goes? SCREITCH. So she choose wisely for her good, it is: Else choice is impotent, must be revised, Falls back to equity. BARBARA. I will not chooseâ At best, a husband is an awful thing! But this seems past belief! SCREITCH. What marvellest at? BARBARA. Why, that while all beside are blind with tearsâ All standing still aghast, or running madâ Guests wondering, kinsmen whispering, servants sobbingâ That he, in whom resides the castle's peace, Should muse on love and pullets! RUDESTEIN. I am naught! I must sit still! BARBARA. My lord is lost in sorrow! How should he rule at such a time as this? Grief-poisonedâcare-confounded? RUDESTEIN. Screitch sustains The burden of his state and governmentâ Fills his high place, the prop of Rolandseck! BARBARA. The strongest might call out for help, to-night. RUDESTEIN. What hour dost think it is? BARBARA. The next to sunset. RUDESTEIN. Is it so late? BARBARA. Hast viewed the soldiers' scarfs? RUDESTEIN. Are all their bucklers cleansed and newly burnished! BARBARA. Hast loosed the castle ensign from its staff? RUDESTEIN. Who leads the household, now that I may not? BARBARA. What guests? RUDESTEIN. How many lances? BARBARA. Who rides first? RUDESTEIN. Better place all the trumpets by themselves: The men at arms show statelier undivided. BARBARA. Two knights support the banner, do they not? RUDESTEIN. Dost mount the heralds next? SCREITCH. I have o'erlooked These cares too longâcome with me, Barbara. RUDESTEIN. Why, mercy on us, man! is this to do? BARBARA. The castle warden bears the coronet? Six pennons of our ownâhow many strange ones? RUDESTEIN. Six of our own with those from Weilenberg. Take heed the horsemen jostle not the priests! SCREITCH. They go the first? RUDESTEIN. Dost hear him, Barbara? A skilful marshal! What art gaping at? Twelve men at arms, and then the pursuivants. How should my cousin order these things now? Come bustleâwouldst disgrace thyself and us? Good sooth, a learned Seneschal! BARBARA. He is Amazed, and in a strait! I pray thee aid us! RUDESTEIN. What dost thou weep forâwhy this passion, Barbara? Not Iâwho thanks me for mine aid?âdisgraced, Put out from trust! BARBARA. Thou dost not love me, then! RUDESTEIN. Wellâstir, and look about theeâcall the squiresâ Send every man that shames us not. SCREITCH. What!âall? RUDESTEIN. Lo, this is learning! he must thwart me still! Wilt do the work thyself?âthen set about it! All but the porter-grooms and prison-guardâ The more the statelier. I will place the watch. [Exeunt. SCENE V. NightâCastle Gates. The Porters, and a Crowd with torches. 1ST. PORTER. Drive them from off the drawbridgeâkeep it clear. 2ND. PORTER. Good people, stand aloof. 1ST. PORTER. Nay, good or not, They shall, or break my mace in twain. Hold now! Pray which may you be? 1ST. CLOWN. Faith, sir, pretty wellâ Some have been better, sir, but good enough! 1ST. PORTER. For what? Grimme, pitch him in the moatâoff with him! Being good, he shames his fellowsâdrown him firstâ Your very well draws envy. 2ND. PORTER. Let us halve them: Thou drown the good, and I the other sort. 1ST. PORTER. With all my heartâI shall have least to doâ Scarce one in twelve. So, sir, your quality? 2ND. CLOWN. Why middling, master. 1ST. PORTER. Stand between us hereâ Knock for his brains on thy side, I on mine. He shall declare his faction ere he swim. These neutrals side with either that is nearest: I hate a double face. Enter RUDESTEIN. RUDESTEIN. Thou dost abjure Thy mystery, then, and Janus. 1ST. PORTER. We maintainâ This simple Grimme and I, sir, do continue Our footing here, though neither out nor in; Ill perched upon the threshold, yet we tarry! While some there be left-handed, swivil-sighted, Smooth-spoken, supple-witted, seven-fold gifted, Who scarce can bide in peace, though locked and barred! RUDESTEIN. Dame, take those children farther backâdost hear? 1ST. PORTER. She should belong to meâa strange good woman! A widow too, and poor enough for grace. RUDESTEIN. Why dost not keep thy babes at home? WIDOW. They have none. 1ST. PORTER. Marry, I doubt her nowâshe is too briefâ The best have ever much to say. 2ND. PORTER. Poor soul, Her tears have choked her! Dame, be comforted! Thy benefactress is with God. WIDOW. I know it. 2ND. PORTER. He pities all, but most the fatherless. 1ST. PORTER. The buttery dole is stopped since yesterday. 2ND. PORTER. It will begin again. RUDESTEIN. Then what dost grieve for? 1ST. PORTER. Have patience, dame! WIDOW. I have. RUDESTEIN. We all lose friends. WIDOW. Hast lost thy best and last, as I have done? God grant thee patience too! RUDESTEIN. They comeâstand wide! Hark! 'tis the anthem! 1ST. PORTER. Take those bonnets off! Keep the way clear there!âforce them farther back! Music heard through the gateway. Soldiers on foot. Heralds and trumpets on horseback. The banner supported, and followed by Knights mounted. Priests, Friars, and Choristers, singing and carrying torches. Father Philip supported, bearing the cross. The bier under a canopy. Ellen habited and veiled as a Nun between two others. Weilenberg, supported by Pages. Knights, Squires, Pursuivants, Servants, succeeded by Soldiers. The Procession passes over the drawbridge and descends toward the river, followed by the multitude. Rudestein, Screitch, Barbara, and Porters remain. RUDESTEIN. Why dost not follow, Seneschal? 1ST. PORTER. He stands Beyond the confines of his kingdom now, Sinking his royalty. SCREITCH. Hast seen this foot Outside the drawbridge till to-night? RUDESTEIN. I have. SCREITCH. Not since my horse was borrowed. RUDESTEIN. I have seen No wise man look so like a satchel-carrier Descending from his martyrdom of birchâ A pocketer of pippins newly whipped. Thine eyes have drowned thy manhood! SCREITCH. Tully wept, And Naso, heavilyâthey both record it. 1ST. PORTER. Not for a nobler lady whosoe'er. BARBARA. Grimme's huge red head hangs dripping all awry, Like sun-flowers after thunder storms. 1ST. PORTER. Bethink thee, There fall no wardrobe legacies to usâ As mantles laced and lined with martin-skin: No, nor yet petticoats, nor smaller mattersâ Rings, chains, and claspsâbequeathments suaging sorrow. It will require a skin of last year's brightest To set my legs as stiffly underneath As they were this day week. BARBARA. The rest find hope, And hope finds comfort. 1ST. PORTER. Where may these be found? BARBARA. Where liquor runs the fastest. 1ST. PORTER. In the Rhine! My hope falls flat again. BARBARA. The hall, thou cuckoo. Our guests have left enough for temperance. RUDESTEIN. We bar excess. Ask thou the Seneschal. SCREITCH. There must be civil order every-where: I will observe these feeders in the hall. Do ye watch here. RUDESTEIN. Like skeletons in stoneâ The bare-ribbed guardians of some monument, Ill fed by gluttonous Death their seneschalâ Each at the archway grinning, stand apart, And watch who comes the next.âLook, this is learning! It makes men's hearts like mill-stones. BARBARA. Prithee, Screitch, Be sociable, and let us tarry here, While these two eat and drink awhile. RUDESTEIN. Begoneâ Beckon your fellows ere the pasties cool; Let every man be wise in liberty. We three will tarry for you here. 1ST. PORTER. Come in. Hoist up the drawbridge, Grimme. RUDESTEIN. What need of that? There may be messengers for things neglected; We will not quit the gate. 1ST. PORTER. Behold a sign! They last not long that grow so quick in grace. I look for his departure. Grimme, ask patience. [Exeunt Porters. RUDESTEIN. How fares thy gentle mistress, mistress Bab? She is unused to grief, but all must season. Who stays behind as comforter? BARBARA. Not one. Her face is paler than her mother's was! What should I speak? I know not how to speak, Nor what is wisely written to that end. RUDESTEIN. Who walks with sorrow, should tread tenderly. Now, where is Ursula? BARBARA. Ursula is a fool: No matter where she is. Well, so then, Ursula! And who, forsooth, is Ursula? Wonderful! Is Ursula's breeding clerkly more than mine? RUDESTEIN. Bab, thou art made of charity, but still Nature can profit little by herself. There needs, for grief and comfort, art and study. BARBARA. In all this house, there is but one that sees What counsel suits a Christian, what an owl: That knows the kinds, and forms, and rules of griefâ Nor, trust me, is that Ursula. RUDESTEIN. Who then else? Is it the Father Philip? BARBARA. Nor he, nor thou. Philip is great with Chrysostom and Catoâ But is he here at hand? RUDESTEIN. This Screitch were nought: His studies lie away from human letters; Nor be they deep elsewhere. SCREITCH. Who told thee so? Thou didst not sound my shallowness thyself. Are Philip's deeper? RUDESTEIN. Ay. SCREITCH. Bring out thy scales, Then hang thyself, with all thou hast, beside him, And see which kicks the beam. RUDESTEIN. Philip is chaste. Go, feed thyself and bacons in the hall! BARBARA. He shall not go! There may be prodigals As fain to eat 'midst swine, with greater need. SCREITCH. Bravely, sweet Barbaraâright upon the comb! His jest will shake its feathers, marry will it! BARBARA. Thou shalt go comfort EllenâI myself Will see to peace and order in the hall. (Exeunt Screitch and Barbara.) RUDESTEIN, alone. This were a merry world, were laughter mirthâ But part of it is treachery, more is scorn! Screitch has his learnÃ¨d triumphs every day; While Barbara laughs at Screitch, and I at Barbara. This baggage would be baroness!â'Tis strange That hearts exempt from fear should beat so hard! Is expectation stronger than remorse? I have, in childhood, ventured thrice as greatlyâ With one hand trusting to a wallflower's toughness, Ill-balanced o'er these battlements, hung down To thrust the other 'twixt the corbeils underâ Full three-score fathoms sheer above the Rhineâ All for a starling's egg or two:âhave climbed Some nook unthought of since the builders left it, To sit amidst their maze of masonry, Screamed at by daws. 'Twas slip and perish then! My kinsman's tyranny was but some dislike To some loose practices of mineâat times A sharp authority in his own houseâ Therefore I turn him out of it!âThis world Moves likes a Tartar waggon drawn by mares: The first are right and wrongâthen force and fortune. Who drives may change their order either way, And harness as he will. So now they come!â Count Albert first. Enter Count, Hubert, and Soldiers. COUNT. Stop here, and breathe awhile! RUDESTEIN. In absence of the baron, welcome, Sir! COUNT. We gain the castle, as you gained your Barbaraâ Almost too easily. Pass on and halt. Eustace, secure the gates. Where be these porters? RUDESTEIN. With Barbara in the hall. COUNT. And where is Ellen? Let us deal tenderlyâshe need not know Whose house she lives in yet. RUDESTEIN. Are all embarked? The rest is ordered so, we cannot err. Run, Gregory, up the streamâtake these behind theeâ Thou wilt find boats prepared within a mile: Get in, and let the current float thee back; Then land upon the isle, and bring the barges, But cut the flats and ferry-boats adrift. COUNT. Collect their oarsâmake haste! [Exit Gregory. RUDESTEIN. And now, sir page, Put fetters on the impatient in the hall. Suppose me dead, and say soâwhat dost wait for? I must be missed awhile. HUBERT. Your highness sends me? I serve none else. COUNT. Quick! quick, man! hold them fast. [Exit Hubert. RUDESTEIN. This cock must lose his spursâDivide the restâ One half may man the walls. COUNT. Lift up the bridge! Our numbers will be more by break of day: The horse are left below. Bring torches hither! Be watchful, Eustace!âNow I am at home! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Ante-room to Ellen's Chamber. Screitch and Ursula. URSULA. She will not hear thee, Screitch; she lacks the patience. SCREITCH. Then tell her that I come to make it more. URSULA. Thou ever dost diminish mine. SCREITCH. Because I turn my cares to Barbara, art aggrieved? Beware of jealousy! URSULA. Is Barbara meek? SCREITCH. By blood and nature, noâshe was as thouâ But is reclaimed by precept. (Enter Barbara.) BARBARA. Lost! all lost! SCREITCH. What ails thee, Barbara? BARBARA. Canst not ring the bell? Goat, buzzard, owl! URSULA. Thy scholar brings thee grace!â Art crazed? BARBARA. All lost! URSULA. What else beside thy wits? Is this a time for jests and fooleries? Bethink thee where we are! BARBARA. He was a man! He fought an hour upon his hands and knees! He would not live a coward! SCREITCH. What has chanced? Who is it? BARBARA. Rudestein! SCREITCH. What of Rudestein? BARBARA. Killed! SCREITCH. Be patient, childâno matter! URSULA. Who has killed him? BARBARA. Count Albert! URSULA. Where? BARBARA. Between the gate and bridge. URSULA. Count Albert at the gate?âShame on thee, Barbara! Wouldst fright thy mistress now? BARBARA. Then let her hide! The Count is in the castle! SCREITCH. Who is with him? BARBARA. Ten thousand thousand murderers!âWilt believe? [Enter Count, Hubert, and Soldiers. BARBARA. Screitch, what dost wear thy sword for? SCREITCH. Get behind! I too will fight an hour upon my kneesâ They shall not harm thee, Barbara! COUNT. Take his sword. We cannot spare the leisure, Screitch.âBe mute! Hold thou thy tongueâthy mother's tongueâdost hear! One word of latin hangs theeâWhere is Ellen? URSULA. Your highness would not fright her now? COUNT. Where is she? URSULA. Let her not learn these cruelties! COUNT. I am loath To part a second time without adieu.â Is Hubert here? O, wait till I shall call. Lady, I had no choiceâshe gave me none. Dost think to pelt me back again with words? That ere I came, I did not count the cost? We scarce shall yield to Ursula's eloquence. It is a cruel timeâso use it gently. She stands between her father and myselfâ Tell her she has the power to heal unkindnessâ And make all whole. URSULA. To-night, my lord? COUNT. Ay now. URSULA. Your highness will have patience! COUNT. She is wise: The baron's ease requires it more than mine: For his sake, she will shorten what offends him. Go, bear my services. Now, where is Hubert? Take Screitch for conduct with thee to the isle. Say that I sent thee to the baron there, In early quittance of his courtesiesâ But shall be better pleased with gentler dealings: He may regain his peace by healing mine. Go with him, Seneschal! SCREITCH. And Barbara too? Release me, Barbara. COUNT. Lady, wilt be gone? (to Ursula.) Or must I spare thy toil, and go myself? (Exit Ursula.) What need of Barbara? She remains with us. Thou shalt be free to tarry or return. SCREITCH. Be patient, Bab! END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Cloisters of the Priory at Rolandswerth. The Church, opening into them, seen lighted beyond. Weilenberg, Father Philip, Ellen veiled, Prioress, Nuns, and Attendants returning from the funeral. WEILENBERG. Thanks, lady, for these pains: believe them such, Not as they seem proportionless or faithless, But honest as they are. PRIORESS. We have put forth Our duties feebly measured by our will, Yet with what strength we had. WEILENBERG. Again, good night! As good as prayers or holier tears can make it. She thanks thee too whose heart is with us here. I pray make haste to visit her again. PRIORESS. We shall be with her yet before we sleep. Such vigils will not rob us of our rest! Brother, I promised for us both, with these (to Philip) To help our prayers. PHILIP. Who stops us at the gate? Move on! make way there! PRIORESS. Night comes earlier now: It is not late. PHILIP. We draw toward ten o'clock! I know not why we tarry thus. 1ST. ATTENDANT. Adrift? 2ND. ATTENDANT. Gone whither? 3RD. ATTENDANT. Down the stream. 1ST. ATTENDANT. Who says they are? 3RD. ATTENDANT. I do that saw them go. PHILIP. Saw what? 3RD. ATTENDANT. The boats. PHILIP. Well, bring us where they are, then. 3RD. ATTENDANT. They are goneâ The larger craft down stream unsteered and empty: The rest across. WEILENBERG. What hindrance stays us thus? PHILIP. Where be these boatmen? 2ND. ATTENDANT. In the pageant here: They left their charge, to follow with the rest. PHILIP. The boats are gone! 1ST. ATTENDANT. Make room! stand back! The Seneschal, my lord! PHILIP. Then send him in. 1ST. ATTENDANT. This other is a servant of the Count. PHILIP. Give place, and let them pass. Enter Screitch and Hubert. WEILENBERG. Who sent thee, Screitch? SCREITCH. Count Albert with his page, a foolish youth, Nor safely trusted by himself: he bears His message to my lord. WEILENBERG. From whom? SCREITCH. The Count. WEILENBERG. Count Albert sent it to me!âwhence? SCREITCH. The castle. WEILENBERG. He!âwhat does he there? SCREITCH. Much as if at homeâ And talks about the gallows masterlike. The castle was surprised an hour ago. WEILENBERG. Surprised? PHILIP. What says this babbler? WEILENBERG. Rolandseck! PHILIP. Do thou speak for him, son. HUBERT. He says the truth. WEILENBERG. Surprised, sir!âwho surprised it? HUBERT. May I speak? WEILENBERG. Ay, so thou speak at once. SCREITCH. The Count surprised it. WEILENBERG. Then who betrayed it,âthou? (Seizes Screitch.) PRIORESS. I pray release him! Think where we are, my lord! WEILENBERG. A traitor too! PHILIP. There was a vow to Godâand lo, he proves us! Have patience still. ELLEN. Remember what was promised! PRIORESS. Peace, daughter!âcome with meâdo thou remember! (She leads Ellen into the church and closes the door.) WEILENBERG. My child! pray speak!âNot thou, go drive him henceâ Let him not make me mad!âMy daughter, sir? (swoons.) PHILIP. Till he can better hear thee, peaceâGive help! This passion staggers life! HUBERT. Stand from him, Screitch; Leave room for air. PHILIP. Bring us a seatâhe wakes. WEILENBERG. Sirrah, where is she? HUBERT. She is safe, my lord. WEILENBERG. Is there no help?âHave mercy yet awhile! Then strike, and I will bear itânot this child! Surprised!âit could not be surprisedâhe bought itâ He tarried there so long to purchase treason: Now, where is Rudestein? SCREITCH. Slain before the gate: Count Albert slew him there. WEILENBERG. Who sold me, then? SCREITCH. Where didst thou find me, youthâand what about? PHILIP. This trifler chafes me too! HUBERT. The gates were wideâ We found the drawbridge as the pageant left it. WEILENBERG. This mantle chokes me!âWhom dost gaze at thus? Be gone! PHILIP. He will, my lord. WEILENBERG. Take off this cloakâ Thy master could not make me thusâhe liesâ Go, tell him so, and what thou wilt beside. I have slept ill of lateâhe could not do itâ The heat has made me faint. HUBERT. I have no will In bearing what I bring, my lord. It is The curse of such as I to blush and serve. 'Twere better live by beggary, and be spared The greater shame, than thus return a thief Where welcome was so liberal! WEILENBERG. Pray forgive! I wound the unoffending yet againâ And speak before a servant of his lord! Thou art not yet a father, gentle youth, Or I would ask no patience. What dost bring me? Now for this message from the Count?âbe brief! HUBERT. Chased out from Rolandseck, he so far makes The balance just, he says;âin what remains, He shall be better pleased with kinder dealings; And that your Lordship may regain your peace By first restoring his. WEILENBERG. Alas! ill-broke, And raw to basenessâwhat dost falter at? HUBERT. I do not love my harness. WEILENBERG. Tell the Countâ It is to him, not of him, that I speakâ He looked for traitors where he lived a guest; He chose an hour to strike whom Death had stricken; He mocks me at the grave.âWilt thou say this? HUBERT. I will, my lord. WEILENBERG. There has been hate enough, But still in honour, tell him: neither side Has hired from fraud its cowardice till now. Henceforth he must endure the names I send himâ Traitor, and traitor-maker, coward beside, Unless he cast his fortune from the scaleâ The difference which his fraud has made between usâ And like a soldier, meet me as I am; Of late grown old apace. Lend arms to-nightâ The thief that stole them should be so far justâ To-morrow I will hoot him at his gate; Coward, traitor, traitor-maker, say. PHILIP. Thine heart Is in thy mastery, though thy hands are not; Keep it from counsels such as these, my son! Where is the Lady Ellen? HUBERT. She is safe, And will be honoured. WEILENBERG. Will she be restored? SCREITCH. The Lady Ellen would not hear my counsel: But is it thrown away? I keep, and use it. The crumbs rejected serve to feed ourselves; Let us receive them humbly. Where didst find me? PHILIP. This haste may do us wrong. Give space to breathe. She would not hear thee, sayest? Let me go with them. Haply I shall find access where she is. My lord, let me go too! We scarce can mar What seems so ruinous, by awkward handling. There needs a comforter; but time let slip Is lost, with hopes mere precious than itself. What sayest thou, son, wilt take me there? HUBERT. I will. WEILENBERG. If so, make haste: be with her in my place. PHILIP. Now which way went the Prioress? Tarry for me. Expect me at the boat. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Church, lighted. A Coffin before the Altar. Ellen and Prioressâthe veils of both withdrawn. PRIORESS. To what thou seemest and art, the words were aptâ He marked them not. ELLEN. Then spare to chide me thus. PRIORESS. Ay, so I willâbut henceforth how to trust thee? Be patient yet. ELLEN. I am. PRIORESS. Be thankful too! Good guidance brought thee with us here. ELLEN. I know it, And have confessed it on my knees. Till now Her voice seemed near who taught me to endure. My steps to-night were steady as your own, The tears I shed as few. But this is hard, That he should prove so cruel who has left us No home to rest in coming from the grave!â Hard to have loved the hard-hearted! PRIORESS. Love! what now? For other thoughts I brought thee where we are. We blessed the All-merciful, and so He is: But yet his judgments follow one apace, And must outrun them both:âthey shall not prosper! ELLEN. My father? God forbid! what has he done? Judgment for what? PRIORESS. Askest thou for what?âlook there! [Points to the coffin. Hast lost remembrance of thy mother's tears? So soon forgot? I saw them on her cheek, Washing the freshness off it day by day, Till changed to what she is:âand still I see them! Judgment for what?âis one of these hard-hearted? Which was it broke her heart, if only one? ELLEN. She pitied the unhappy. PRIORESS. So did I. ELLEN. His misery is the more to need forgiveness. My mother, look upon me! leave me not! There is no bosom now to hide my tears! O, hear me still, my mother! PRIORESS. Hush! she doesâ This passion is of sinâI am thy mother. ELLEN. O, noânot thouâwe never have but one! Enter Philip. PHILIP. There is hope yet! PRIORESS. We need it. PHILIP. I must haste! PRIORESS. The hope of what? PHILIP. Peace, sister! hear me speakâ This Count has cast his net upon a stakeâ So far the purpose of his treason fails. He climbs so high to reach an empty nest: The bird is flown! Why tarry in the wind Rocked to and fro 'twixt hate and mockery? He cannot bide up there alone! He finds No hostage, as he hoped, nor plea for violenceâ No tenure but a thief's, who must appear At last, descending from the chimney's top, So much the blacker as he stays the longer. The page who brought this message, takes me back. PRIORESS. Is Ursula faithful, thinkestâor has he learnt That what is lost is here? PHILIP. He had not learnt, When these came from him, that he was a loser; But held the unopened casket in his hand, Nor doubted if the pearl were there or no. I run to mis-direct pursuit from us By asking access in her father's nameâ Demanding what is missed as if he hid it. Guile in defence is not injurious, When, like the lapwing's feignings of distress, It cries the loudest farthest from mischance. Count Albert must not look toward Rolandswerth!â The gods he served are desecratedâpraiseâ The majesty of honor. He that spurns His ancient worship, will deal worse with ours, Defenceless truth and innocence afraid. Our gates are weaker than the castle's were. PRIORESS. He will not seek her here? PHILIP. Sister, he will; If he shall hope to find her here, he must; Constrained by shame to darn his tattered treachery, And tack advantage as a fringe to fraud. Daughter, be prisoner to thy promise stillâ Lock up this secret, give the key to us!â Who leave their wits behind thrive ill abroad: Let me not doubt of mischief while away: Thou wilt not draw the veil from off thy face, Till I come back. ELLEN. To none beside my father. PHILIP. Thy father!ânone beside thy father, sayest? Marry, this cuts our counsel short enough! The mystery need not borrow of our brains. Tell thou thy fatherâlet me tell the Count! Lo, this is all I wished thee not to do! Whom else wouldst hide thee from? ELLEN. But why from him? He is as wise as we are. PHILIP. Not to-night. ELLEN. Philip, he will endure as he sees me. His knowledge cannot reach to Rolandseck. PRIORESS. Wouldst tell him,âwhy? ELLEN. To make his misery less. PHILIP. Child, he has sent defiance by this page; Proclaimed the Count a traitor, as he isâ And coward, which he is not. This must be hushed, Or will be answered. PRIORESS. What dost purpose, then? PHILIP. To humble both while each believes her lost, And waken hope, in both, to repossess. To keep their hate apart, then tread it out. They cannot tarry as they are. The Count Has sold his honor for an empty house, At last not his. My lord will fear to leave His child up there; and of his too great pride Abate a part to ransom her. ELLEN. Then goâ Make hasteâI will do any thing! PHILIP. Do this. ELLEN. Let me be veiled, and see him soâI will! Trust me, he shall not know me. PHILIP. We risk all! I must be goneâWell, kneel, childâlook this wayâ Swear by the altar, and by her before it! The baron shall not learn thy presence here Till I come back! PRIORESS. If thou shouldst not come back? PHILIP. Release her, in my name, at break of day. Do as thy wisdom teaches thee. ELLEN. I swear! PHILIP. It is a vow to Godâand by her soul Make it, and keep it, awfully! ELLEN. I will! PHILIP. The altar and the grave are witnesses. [Exeunt. SCENE III. On the Island. A boat and boatmen seen by moonlight at some distance. The Castle on the farther side of the Rhine. Screitch and Hubert. HUBERT. I may not tarry longer for this priest. The words we bear are winged like thunder-bolts: Their echo will be louder than themselves. Do thou stay here. SCREITCH. I mustâto gather breath. HUBERT. All spent so soon? How shalt thou reach the height Whence Barbara sends her sighs to meet and greet thee? With clearer wind-pipe sobs the sea-horse drowning! A leaden Cupid at a Dutchman's gate Might blush for such a worshipper.âCanst guess Why both these masters speed their errands thusâ The old and new one chuck thee to and fro? Canst tell me why? SCREITCH. I can. HUBERT. Then do. SCREITCH. The nurse Is seen to travel at her weanling's heels, With hand outstretched to pluck him from the dirt, And rod to stir remembrance of mischance. Now for this page's prate of Barbara! HUBERT. Wouldst learn her doingsâwhat she is about? She laughs, and lengthens yet her holiday. She sits with Rudestein and the Count at supper. She thinks and speaks of theeâthy love, thy learning, Thy vigilance to-night, thine embassy. All three have shining faces through thy means, But look for larger mirth at thy return. SCREITCH. It is a sin to lie if men will credit; A silly sin to lie when none believes. HUBERT. Thou sayest so, Seneschal, of whom? SCREITCH. A page Whose birth, breath, breeding, have none other use. Rudestein is dead. HUBERT. Then lies will be the less. He must have been a page, or page-begotâ Page-bred, page-principled, and propertied. We found him at the gateâand thou shalt find him With empty flasks and Bab on either hand. Haply she told thee of his death? SCREITCH. She did. HUBERT. Then Barbara is a page in petticoats. A Christian soldier lies? SCREITCH. Ay, many do. HUBERT. Art ready, Seneschal? SCREITCH. For what? HUBERT. For death. (Draws. SCREITCH. A Christian Seneschal is always ready. Once since the sunset have I thought me nearer, But now the readier if thou saidst the truth. My lord believes me faithlessâBarbara isâ Behold, child, I defy thee! HUBERT. Get thy breath: Unsheathe, and then stand fast. SCREITCH. I yield my neck, As Tullius did to those from Anthony. The sheath is all I have. HUBERT. 'Twas all I left thee. Yon bright moon sees me blush.âHere comes the Father. Enter Philip. PHILIP. The Seneschal is old in suffering wrongs, And like the old, forgets. HUBERT. Let there be peaceâ On my part love and honour, Seneschal. PHILIP. Make me partaker in this league. There is Enough of wrath elsewhere. HUBERT. With all my heart. PHILIP. We need not be the merchants of men's hate: Contention wants not us to speed its traffic. The peaceful lips are blessed. HUBERT. Father, thou hast No Lord but one who cannot be disgracedâ I keep aloof, mine may. PHILIP. Hast thou but one? And is he honoured best by doing ill? Best served by worst of services? Wouldst pick The straws which misery scatters in its haste, And bind them up as gleanings for the cruel? His honour who has robbed the house he dwelt in, Requires to slay his host! If such thy calling, It is accursed. HUBERT. And if dogs felt as men, I should run mad, to carry in my mouth No matter what, or what its filthiness. To chase my last kind feeder out of doors, And tear grief's freshest robes like beggar's rags. The Baron was a soldier onceâhe knows The shortest way to justice. Here, at least, He is not rash, but wise. SCREITCH. I fain would stake His white hairs now 'gainst this Count Albert's black, Were grief away which makes the helmet heavy, And care which dries the bones. PHILIP. It must not be. HUBERT. Father, it were the best for both of them! The loser gains. PHILIP. There is one more to think for: What hath she done amiss? Thyself art youngâ Youth should be pitiful. HUBERT. If all my blood Might save the shedding of but half her tears, It should run every drop!âDoes God forsake her, So fair and innocent as she is? Speak outâ I fear as little as thyself. The Count Has lost a princely name since yesterday; And some who serve him, blush for him. Foul love And this suggesting traitor, damn us all! This piebald Rudestein! Shall I tell him so? PHILIP. Tell truth, but wiselyâmake this challenge airâ The breath of wrath and rashness, as it was. HUBERT. Instruct me as we go. The boat there, Gregory! This way the bank gives safest footing, Screitch: Tread where the moon shinesâhere are steps of stone. SCREITCH. It is a youth whose breeding should be cared for: I will bestow some pains. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Night. Chamber in the Castle. Count Albert and Barbara. COUNT. Hast found her, Barbara? BARBARA. We have searched thrice through All places that are possible to hide in, And thrice as many that are not, my lordâ But still we cannot find her. COUNT. Where is Ursula? BARBARA. Safely locked up. COUNT. Her tears are passionlessâ I doubt this close composure. BARBARA. I do not. Her grief is sullen, as it used to be: Feebler she is in pride than heretofore, But else unchanged. COUNT. Then let us search again. Enter Rudestein. What comfort, Rudestein? RUDESTEIN. Worse than none at all! A hundred torches lend their light to find Despair instead of it. COUNT. Begin once more! She could not quite expend herself in sighsâ Fine as that body is, it must have substance. Walls such as these were partly built to hide in; What seemed compact of rock had caves scooped outâ Panting and listening, like a frighted fawn, She stoops in one of these. RUDESTEIN. How late didst see her?â And where, Bab, was it? BARBARA. When the sun went down: And in the chamber opening to her bed:â Not where she sleeps, but next this side of it. RUDESTEIN. She must have issued by the public stairsâ Or through the casement, like a lark uncaged! I have slept there before this bird was hatched. Her nest is in a tower on three sides naked, With slanting battlements, and foot advanced, As treading giddily on such a height. Its walls are solidâboth the lights one way. A mossy sort of ledge for briars and weeds, Where the rock mingles with the masonry Confounding which is which, is all beneath them From height to depth, between the daws and fishes. BARBARA. She has not ventured there! COUNT. Is it possible? BARBARA. She would not do it! COUNT. But could she if she would? Is the thought possible? RUDESTEIN. She dared not think it. Who searched that chamber first? BARBARA. I followed Ursula. RUDESTEIN. Were both the casements closed? BARBARA. Noâone was not. COUNT. How far beneath the window is that ledge? Could any venture on it? RUDESTEIN. With a rope, Or some such aidance, hanging from aboveâ Not else, though light as Harlequin. BARBARA. And yet The footing seems less perilous than it is, Benched out by briars and wall-flowers. RUDESTEIN. Trusting to it, The world were dear against a new-laid egg. And she!âa lamb at play were scarce so shy! BARBARA. At play she wasâin earnest, I have seen Her eyes look like her father's. COUNT. So have I The last time that I saw themâor shall see them If what we fear be so! BARBARA. It cannot be! COUNT. Else are we damned unprofitably, Bab! RUDESTEIN. Well, what says Ursula to it?âbring her in. [Exit Barbara. I could believe that one might take this leap, Who thought not of the next as sure to follow. The fearful are the desperate when pursued. The lion goes straight, the hare flies any where. This fawn has tried the brambles, perhaps! Enter Ursula and Barbara. We talk Of hares and hunting, mistress Ursula. But lookâsuch doublings as might mend our sport, With mirth and better leisure for the chase, Are dangerous now! Hast thought on what I said? COUNT. We that have gone so far, shall not turn back. RUDESTEIN. Wilt wipe thy tears, and tell us of thy mistress? URSULA. Barbara was with me, ask her where she is. RUDESTEIN. Wouldst rather have one husband, or a score? Speak, thou brine-sodden idiot! URSULA. We left togetherâ We two went out to see the guests assembleâ My lady staid behind us; Barbara knows it. COUNT. Behind you where? URSULA. The chamber next her bed. The door between was closed when I returned. How could I press on grief at such a season? The bells chimed still, the chaunt was heard up there! I have not seen her since. RUDESTEIN. How long didst wait? URSULA. Till Screitch and Barbara found me thereâthey first, And soon his grace. COUNT. But was the door closed still? URSULA. Your highness saw me knock, and made me enter. COUNT. Were both the casements shut? URSULA. But one of them. Barbara was with me, let her speak. COUNT. Could grief Have made thy mistress desperate? URSULA. Terror might. BARBARA. Shame on so base a thought! COUNT. Terror at what? URSULA. Your highnessâBarbara's cries to hide herselfâ So sick and broken-hearted as she was, The Rhine might seem the least unmerciful. RUDESTEIN. We give thee leave to follow. Take her backâ Lock the door fast, and set the casements open. [Exeunt Ursula and Barbara. COUNT. She speaks the truth! RUDESTEIN. Well, spur her to the leapâ Prick her on both flanks. Drown thee in the Rhine! Leap from thy love, my pretty peevish cousin! COUNT. Better the vessel perish than the freight! We pirates gain the wreck of Rolandseck, Its wealth washed out. Her father may reclaim it! RUDESTEIN. I prophesied so much. Enter Barbara, with Philip, Screitch, and Hubert. BARBARA. Your grace beholds The two ambassadors come back! RUDESTEIN. And this That dove-like bears his olive-branch between themâ Welcome thyself and tidings, father Philip! PHILIP. Who was it made thee host at Rolandseck? Which of the two is master here? I crave No larger welcome than sufficed for these. COUNT. What audience hadst thou, Hubert? Speak thou firstâ Hast seen the lord of Weilenberg? HUBERT. I haveâ And sealed your grace's faith beneath mine own For equal payment of the patience shown me. COUNT. Then he was patient? HUBERT. Sparingly at firstâ Awhile he seemed perplexed by what we told him, Confounding names, and hasty through mistakes. Which was his house he knew notâthat or this. He marvelled at a message dated hence, And carried from your highness by his guestâ For so far he remembered me:âhis friends, His kinsmen, people, followers, oddly mixedâ His daughter here, her mother in the churchâ He scarce could understand me. COUNT. When he did? HUBERT. He swooned, my lordâbut like a wrestler fallen, The first time shorn of victory by mischanceâ He blamed his heedlessness, the ground, the weather, Diminished rest in sleepâhis cloak was heavy, His thoughts distractâthe game was falsely played, The treachery manifest, he saidâbut chief He ill endured that we should see him thus. Some hasty words he dropped about your graceâ There had been hate between your house and his, But neither party sat the other's guests And ate them out a wider way to treasonâ Nor would they wait to strike whom death had stricken. RUDESTEIN. A clerkly page it is, and wise withal! I see the hallowed candlestick behind him Whence falls the illumination! COUNT. What beside? Hast lost the answer that I sent thee for? What said he of his daughter, boy? HUBERT. It was Of her he talked so giddily, my lord: And for her liberty would risk his age, Though hurried onward past its speed of late. Your highness is a soldierâso was he! RUDESTEIN. Good cheer down yonder, Screitch?âthese two are drunk! The Prioress gives her best?âWhat said thy lord? SCREITCH. Of thee? he thinks thee deadâI told him soâ As Barbara taught meâslain before the gate! Fie on thee, Bab! thou hast reported falsely! BARBARA. He fought as well as thou didst. Odds and chance O'erthrow the mightiest! What says Seneca? SCREITCH. He stood a traitor at his kinsman's gate! He sold his birth-place to the Count for gold! The inheritance of his fathers! RUDESTEIN. Stop awhile! Dost call me traitor? SCREITCH. Ay, a second time. Remount me on the horse thou borrowedst from me, And let me make it good. HUBERT. Stand off, and loose himâ He says the truth. SCREITCH. Be thou attorney for me: I loathe to lay mine hand upon a thief. COUNT. Give me this message, father, as it is: And shorten pity's rhetoricâto the pointâ Let slip the repetition of remorse. What would the Baron fight with me about? His house and child?âthe stakes are lost already. We shall be soon too near akin for strife: First let me ask his blessing. PHILIP. I will seek No pity toward my lord, nor from your grace: Both are too proud for that! Scorn scarce can reach So high as his grey head: the imperial crown Would rest henceforth unhonored on thine own. The Baron asks that I may see his child. RUDESTEIN. To licence fraudâsuggest obduracy. A triple twist, fool, priest, and priest's apprentice! Put them all three in ward. COUNT. See her for what? PHILIP. I needs must sink the privilege of my place. Our conference may be here, or where you please. COUNT. Hast thou not seen her once to-day? PHILIP. Three times. Such days come seldomâI have seen her thriceâ I saw her here at sunset. COUNT. Wait without. (Exeunt Philip and Screitch.). RUDESTEIN. This nursling politician, take him too! There may be gossip worth his gathering. The key-holes and his ears are ancient friendsâ Beware to leave the door ajar. HUBERT. I might List long, nor hear so foul a knave again. RUDESTEIN. I cannot seat thee in the stocks to-night. They and the whipping-post are out of doorsâ Tarry till breakfast time. HUBERT. I know the placeâ Between the gate and drawbridge, where we found thee A step this side the gallows. COUNT. Let him go! Hubert, stand from him. Strike who will again, My turn comes next. Boy, what has made thee mad?â Give me the sword, I sayâand get to bed. HUBERT. I will not serve in fellowship like this. The sight of those white hairs has made me madâ Of him so great, now friendless and betrayed! Shame makes me mad! (Hubert throws his sword on the ground, and exit.) COUNT. Place him in ward thereâgo! (The Count, Rudestein, and Barbara remain.) COUNT. The fiend that owns and helps thee, baulk and blast theeâ Then leave thee blacker then himself, thou beast! Art drunk to-night again?âWhose loss is perilled? What canst thou lose or hazard? honorâlove? What farther infamy can touch to harm thee? Why shouldst thou fear disgrace? Canst hear the hiss Which makes me giddy? Art thou damned, as I am, For being a fool alone? BARBARA. My lord, this page Called not your grace a traitor. COUNT. But he didâ Traitor and traitor-teacher, mistress Bab. Hast lost both wits and womanhood?âthine ears As well as honesty? He called me traitor! I lack the advantages of ancient use: I am not yet at ease, like you, with baseness! To me scorn's breath stinks still! RUDESTEIN. Discourse well timed, And eloquent withal, to teach me patience! Temperance sets forth its praises to the drunk!â Well, let us profit by it, mistress mine! Behold the great exemplar, Bab! Ten tongues Are telling all by this time: Father Philip Hath filled his scrip with news to marvel at. My cousin is lost, her father may defy usâ Let him go back and say so! COUNT. He bides here. We must do what we mean to do at once. Shall we prevent this rumour, and be gone? Our better choice is lost! The daughter safe, Love's wrongs had helped us with the vulgar sort, And pride been blamed which would not yield to tears. Now are we thieves and murderers! RUDESTEIN. Treat, then, treat! Affect the conquerorâhenceforth pity moves you; And so make peace, sir. Till the game is lost, I keep my cards. She may be found, perhaps, yet. Assure thee that my kinsman thinks her hereâ Search him, and sift him thoroughly. Take heed That not a whisper pass the gates before theeâ Hold these three fast awhile. COUNT. How treat? by whom? The envoys are locked up. He thinks thee dead. RUDESTEIN. But then I died with credit at the gate. Your highness slew me there. To this extentâ Half-killed, and sorely wounded for his sake, Thrust out of doors, your grace's challengerâ To this extent he might believe me faithful, Remembering how we hated one another. And if he disbelieved meâwell, what then? We are but where we were. I care not whichâ One needs must go, and presently. COUNT. Make haste! When servants shake their heads, our state looks sickâ I must not leave them here. It matters little, Now that the prize we played for falls to neither, Who wins the seconds takes. (Exit Count.) RUDESTEIN. They fall to me. Fiend-tempted I!âa foolâand drunk beside! This page may call me traitor! cuff me too! I looked for this, but scarce on this side Christmas. He pays us early in the oldest coin. BARBARA. Part that he said was true! RUDESTEIN. Of womanhood? I do not quarrel with him for its truth. BARBARA. This jostling of your blood and policy. Mark him when eyes are on him, how sedate! And yet, at heart, as mad as Hercules. RUDESTEIN. It is my turn to make thee marvel, Barbara. Do thou mark me, child.âJudge whose devil is wisest, Is boldest, nimblest, strongestâhis or mine. Now comes the consummation, mistress Bab! 'Tis time to serve ourselves. All hopeless is it? I never felt so pleased, or sped more surely. This girl is in the Rhineâher father is Where he shall rest a hundred years. The Countâ The love-sick Countâis sick of sin beside, And sick of solitude, and sick of usâ Marry, the Count is sick of Rolandseck! Quick! quick, childârun beside me to the boat! And study what I teach thee as we goâ Thou shalt be mistress here before we sleep. [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Chamber in the Priory. Ellen and Prioress. PRIORESS. The fruit is newly plucked, and we have bread. Let both appear officious when he comes. Place the wine this side, daughter: 'tis our bestâ His thirst may not discern how far from good. ELLEN. He promised what was asked of him? PRIORESS. At once, And will disperse his followers through the isle. Such patience grieves me for my thoughts of late. âThis house is yours; I come a guestââhe said, âAnd will not stain its sanctity with blood. There shall be no strife here.â ELLEN. Speak tenderlyâ His heart is softer than it was. PRIORESS. The change From pride to penitence were blessed of late, Till this new shame rekindled what was quenched. ELLEN. I would approach his holier thoughts, thus veiled Till I may show myself. PRIORESS. Be careful then! I must yield what was promised, yet I fear. Our brother's wisdom walks twixt scorn and hate, Whose sole assuagement is the dread to lose thee. Let us not mar these labours. ELLEN. I have asked The strength I need with more humility. Again my mother's voice is in mine earâ I shall not fail. PRIORESS. Beware! (Enter Weilenberg.) WEILENBERG. The crowd is gone; A portion scattered in the search of bread. We cannot aid the lostâand for myself, I stand where none like these may interpose.â A burden on your charity so long, My thoughts are how to ease it. PRIORESS. Our chief shame Is that we look so sparing of our duties, And cold in hospitality to-night: Like thankless children of the world shut out, We seem to learn ingratitude betimesâ Obsequious only when we cannot profit: It makes me blush to deal by measure now! The servants of my lord must bide elsewhere: Our rule gives refuge but to life pursued. WEILENBERG. I may crave entrance for my messengers? If any from the castle knock to-night, They shall come in? PRIORESS. It is directed so, And what we can, provided. WEILENBERG. Then adieu! PRIORESS. Let me beseech my lord to take good heedâ We stand behind the altar where we are: A grate divides us from the sanctuary Pannelled with this before it. (She opens a pannel in the waintscot.) God forbid That violence come thus near to sacrilege! If so, a step will place beyond its reach. I pray remember this, my lord. WEILENBERG. I will. PRIORESS. Daughter, stay thou till I come back again. Wait till I call or send. Watch well the door! A novice of the house, herself unhappy, Has learned to grieve with misery, though so young. Her patience shames our haste. The Saint deceased Loved her the best of all our younger sort: She found similitude in growth and voice To her we tremble for; but this poor child Is almost friendless now. WEILENBERG. Her own is quiteâ In this they differ. PRIORESS. Past eleven o'clock! The midnight service leaves me scarce an hour. [Exit. WEILENBERG. So young, and so unhappy, as she says? May God forbid! ELLEN. The Prioress leaves me here That I may learn to suffer. WEILENBERG. She forgets That grief speeds best and easiest out of sight. Ours cannot help each other. ELLEN. Then farewell: Your Lordship's thoughts are far too high for mine: Greatness may gain by scorn, what such as I Must ask with tears. WEILENBERG. What may it gain? ELLEN. Endurance. WEILENBERG. Thy means are safest, child. I have no tears. I that have caused them dailyâfor whose sake They fell so fast, have none. What else we learn, Is what I taughtâa task of twenty yearsâ To bear and hold my peace. I am hard-heartedâ The Prioress tells the truth. ELLEN. She says not so. WEILENBERG. Being good, she may forbear to say so now: But yet she loved her friend and patroness. ELLEN. Not more than I. WEILENBERG. Too proud for such endurance? Who was it told thee so, if she did not? ELLEN. I said too high, my lord. WEILENBERG. Couldst love so much, Yet spare to pity? Or didst see that faceâ Pale as the marble saints around it nowâ And not discern its tears? ELLEN. I pitied too. WEILENBERG. Pitied and loved?âdost know who grieved and killed her? Who brought her where she isâwho murdered her? She did not trust thee, or she told thee thatâ Who broke her heart? Heaven bless your charity! A gracious office this of tendering comfort! Old curses are too swift for such young prayers. Behold the tyrant in his cage at last! He has not one on earth who loves or pitiesâ The last that did, has left it. Why shouldst weep? I have no wife to grieve and persecuteâ No child to shame and frighten. God is justâ The roof above my head is not mine own; And she who hides me here, would hiss me out, But spares her breath awhile through charity!â Dost love my daughter too? ELLEN. Myself no more. WEILENBERG. She is as young, and now as miserable. Weep for them bothânot me. ELLEN. O, peace! WEILENBERG. Those tears Should make us friends for her sake. Canst believe That, cruel as I am, I loved her too? We talked of patience, art alone like her? ELLEN. The same, my lord. WEILENBERG. Not helpless as she is? ELLEN. Some pity meâ There is none left to help meâthey are lost Who loved me best. I have no friend but you. WEILENBERG. But me? ELLEN. You said my tears should make us friends. My father is as I. WEILENBERG. Thou hast one then? ELLEN. And so has she. WEILENBERG. The more her grief in having! ELLEN. Mine is so poor, he has no home for either. WEILENBERG. 'Twas wiser quit the world, than stay to hate it. ELLEN. They say that we should hate itâyet till now I knew not why we should. To me it seemed Like Him who made it, holy. I loved its flowersâ Its living creatures were my pleasant friends: The streams were fair, the mountains beautifulâ Nor knew I better than the birds in spring How to despise its gifts and be unhappy. They too have some who chase and persecute! Even what is ill, I knew not how to hate. WEILENBERG. Thou hast lived long in little time, and yet Been gently nursed, it seems? ELLEN. Alas, too gently! Met by fond smiles and open hands stretched out; Praised, watched for, waited on. I live to see How merciless is one who said he loved me. Let me confess so muchâI love the cruelâ My father's misery is through me. WEILENBERG. Alas! âBe patient, and he may forgive thee yet. The hard-hearted love their children. ELLEN. What forgive? WEILENBERG. That shame. ELLEN. It is not hisâsorrow I bring him, But ignorantly, not shame. Did I say shame? WEILENBERG. Methought you did. This swoon bewilders meâ The traitor's hand is hard upon my throat: The bell which brought us here, tolls farther off: My daughter's voice is on thy lips!âAll sounds Abuse me thus.âThou lovest this father still? ELLEN. So does your daughter you, my lord. WEILENBERG. Art sure? ELLEN. Why not? WEILENBERG. Be sure of nothing!âask no more. He has been always good? ELLEN. To me he has. WEILENBERG. Thou didst not tremble when his steps drew near; Nor think which way to hide thee? Why dost weep? He did not kill thy mother? ELLEN. Pray forbear! WEILENBERG. Why dost thou weep? I, that have been all this, And done all this, cannot! Enter Prioress. PRIORESS. Be gone, childâquick! There is a messenger whose haste knocks hardâ But neither of the two we waited forâ Your lordship's kinsman. WEILENBERG. Rudestein? I forget, But surely some one told me he was dead. PRIORESS. His arm is bandaged, and he speaks with pain. Go, hide thee, daughterâthat wayâby the grate. Remember where it leads. ELLEN. I shall stay there; And may be called, if needed. PRIORESS. Get thee gone! Exeunt Ellen and Prioress, different ways. Enter Rudestein. WEILENBERG. A double treason in one night? They lied Who said that death had shortened infamy: Both hope and faith die first. RUDESTEIN. And charity! I have outlived all three of them! Ah me, The greatest was but small! WEILENBERG. What price art sold for? RUDESTEIN. I stand upon my bargain with the Count, The payment follows when the work is done. I have earned nothing from him yet. WEILENBERG. For what? RUDESTEIN. For treacheryâI come hither to that end. Nothing is doneâthrough lack of means to do it. There was no trust, and therefore none betrayed. I gain but cuffs which laid my wits asleep, With here and there a hole beside. The same Who told that I was dead, believed his eyes: I thought so too. WEILENBERG. Count Albert sent thee hither? RUDESTEIN. He did. WEILENBERG. For what? RUDESTEIN. For treachery, as I said. He quits me of some crowns I lost and borrowed: He heals the wounds he gave me. Twice this week My life was in his hands. I shall have goldâ A large and careless rentalâwhat I please. Beside that all ingratitude is sin, There be some vanities, as wine, dice, women, Which my good lord of yesterday eschews, But free to him and me. WEILENBERG. What should these purchase? RUDESTEIN. Treachery, once moreâI say the third time, treachery. My mission hither is with line and hook. I shall be trusted now as one that hates himâ Been baffled by him, beaten, wounded, laughed at This second time, and all within a week. Behold the ambassador! I come for peace. The Father Philip preaches it up yonder. WEILENBERG. Peace suits his temper quite as well as thine. RUDESTEIN. It is from his suggestion. He is wise: Yet darkly sees the things which profit hereâ Calls silver drossâand when he needs must lie, Looks down ashamed. This dross is dear to me: Your lordship's son-in-law will furnish it. Concluding thus, he trusts me. WEILENBERG. What to do? RUDESTEIN. To catch and cage my cousin. The Count is thrifty! He will not squander more of his good name Than buys the equivalentâa maid through love, A barony through ambition. He would keep Possession in the Castle by consent: And silence cavils with your lordship's leave. The time for gathering eye-brows has passed byâ His choice is oursâwe choose by him as proxy. It is provided that you go with me. So stipulate that sorrow have its duesâ Rebuke impatience, put the wedding off, Provide the nuptial covenants ere the feast, Then fill a corner near the Christmas fire: Let loose authority, as weary of it. Withdraw thine age from care! Go softly with him, No doubt you shall be waited on. WEILENBERG. He says so? RUDESTEIN. This tarrying here is scandal to us all! WEILENBERG. What said he to the message by his page? RUDESTEIN. He hangs his mirth upon the challenge-bearersâ Is pleasant in comparisons between you: Shall be your son-in-law instead, he says: Proposes peace, which granted or refused, He makes alliance with you. WEILENBERG. Is this all? RUDESTEIN. Noâfor I have from Ellen a deal beside. You must go homeâbe housed, and clothed, and tendedâ Be comforted, and reconciled, and pleased, Whether you will or no. She would be grieved To see her father, head and heels across, Strapped on his saddle, like a butcher's calfâ In this guise carried home to Rolandseck. WEILENBERG. She will not see it. RUDESTEIN. Philip fills the time Till I go back, with reasonings on his office. He chides them both, and bravely lays about him: Calls Screitch an owl for letting mischief inâ He does indeed! WEILENBERG. Then Screitch did let it in? RUDESTEIN. He did not keep it outâso much appears. Our seneschal is honest, and he is In this like me, that I am like an ass. Screitch sent his porters to replace the guestsâ They feasted, while he watched with Barbara; And she sent him to speak of both the Plinies. The gate and bridge were as my cousin had left them. Wisely Screitch talked as comforter within, Till Albert stopped the argument. My Lord Must summon Cupid for his damages; The girls did what he taught. WEILENBERG. Did Barbara? RUDESTEIN. Ay, truly did sheâBarbara, Ursula, Ellen. Who wars with Love, will have the maids against him. Poor souls, they meant no harm. WEILENBERG. My daughter too? RUDESTEIN. Yea, though she be your daughterâhe has teazed, Ere now, the daughter of as great a man. WEILENBERG. They sold the child, and lie of her. RUDESTEIN. Perhaps so: The privilege of their calling is to lie, And lover's gold its fairest perquisite. My cousin is young and guilelessâboth excuse her. Bab owns her share outright, while Ursula weeps. WEILENBERG. The blessÃ¨d sacrament between their teeth, I would not credit either. RUDESTEIN. No!âwhy so? They reckoned not on doing aught of ill. It was Love's wile. The Count had been pushed out, Adieus prohibited, old forms cut short, No parting sighs allowed on either side, No tokens of celibacy for ayeâ No, not a tear. They thought to mend all this; Looked for the Count who should come in to weep, And so depart again. He came and laughs, Nor will he quit. They shall be sharply chidden. Why, what dost groan and break thine heart about? A scullery porringer is burst to sherdsâ Who cares, or frowns upon the penny-waster? Your crystal chalice is let fallâthe knave Must suffer stripes proportioned to its cost. But is this just? WEILENBERG. Get home againâbegone! RUDESTEIN. My fairy-footed cousin is in loveâ She must forswear, she will forswear her dear: But face to face, by rule and precedent. Could she foretell his lack of modesty? And now this love is so profuse of tears! She is so vehement in his chastisement! Good sooth! my little play-fellow! WEILENBERG. False, false! RUDESTEIN. Our tempest will abate its spite at lastâ The skies grow calm againâtherefore be merryâ Fight not with Cupid, or take better heedâ You quite forget his wings. (Weilenberg sits down and covers his face.) WEILENBERG. Could she deceive me? RUDESTEIN. Not for the sun and moon, in aught but love. Hast lived so long to trust, when maids eschew him? Ah! my good lord's philosophy! he strives To dam the current of five thousand years, And change all nature since the flood! WEILENBERG. So soon? Her mother's burial too! RUDESTEIN. Why, then or never. 'Tis pitiful to see her, how she weepsâ How passionate she is against the Countâ Nay, faith, imperious and disdainful too. She spares him not a whitâMy pretty cousin!â He shall not thrust her father out of doors; He shall not do so longer than is needed. WEILENBERG. Does she say this?âI know that it is neededâ But would not have her say so. RUDESTEIN. What is that? A cry! a sob!âthere must be listeners here. Hark, yet! Methought so.âWell, I will go back. Beware this Count, who laughs at all of us, With love to boot. A traitor's traitor I; The greater hangman's scrub and deputyâ Unnatural like himselfâa slip-shod villain, But worse and readier. He may cuff me thus, Disarm me, wound me, laugh at me, forgive me, And hire me when he wants me, after all. I have been partial toward myself sometimesâ Silver I love and need:âbut still, to tie My garter round thy neck, and hale thee home, 'Twixt kicks and kisses!âsee thee forced to give This speckled tiger-cat thy blessing too!â Set down to rock the cradle of young master, Then pensioned out as troublesome and peevish! To trap and tame thee!âthis were much indeedâ Too much for his behoof! If this miscarry, To drug thy drink, and poison thee outrightâ Thus ease his grace from all incumbrances, And spare the arithmetic of fresh accounts! Good sooth, not I, sir, truly. WEILENBERG. Poison me? RUDESTEIN. If obstinate in restiveness, not else. Look how this scandal must breed worse than noise! The Count at Rolandseck, thyself down here.â Two lords, two claimantsâsuch a cry abroad! Ten thousand tongues against him! What is this? (Takes the cup from the table.) These careful sisters placed it here? Is it wine? Fruit, bread, and what beside? WEILENBERG. I have not tasted. RUDESTEIN. With leave, I will taste first then. Verjuice brewed 'Twixt crabs and sourest Rhine-grapes mixed with Rhine. I need not call for drink as sick and feebleâ So far the means are furnished me. Now mark The sleight he taught so like a mountebank. I trifle with the cupâsip carelesslyâ Replace, resume, employ thine ears and eyes, Hiding the phial in my palm the whileâ Thou shouldst have watched me better, coz. WEILENBERG. For what? RUDESTEIN. The artifice he taught me. WEILENBERG. What hast done? RUDESTEIN. Have drugged the wine. WEILENBERG. Poisoned!âit is not poisoned? RUDESTEIN. Taste, then, and try, coz.âit is strongly poisoned! The mightiest fiends must turn him out of doors As he does us! He changed the dice, I know! His hand is easyâhe has practised this! The physic might have come without a label, Therefore I came myself. 'Tis mightiest poison! Now will I cast it out, and cleanse the cup. Beware his messengers, with what they bring thee; Or yield at once! I will not leave it hereâ Sorrow is careless. WEILENBERG. Let the cup stand! be gone! Dost think I trust thee? RUDESTEIN. It would kill a score! Whether or no, I will not leave it hereâ It shall not bide behind me! WEILENBERG. Get thee henceâ RUDESTEIN. Forbear to press my arm!âWellâgentlyâsoâ [Exit. Ellen advances from the gate. ELLEN. Is the cup poisoned? WEILENBERG. Whatâand if it be? ELLEN. Poisoned! WEILENBERG. He says it is. Go thou to bed! ELLEN. Think where we are. WEILENBERG. I do so heedfullyâ And feel content to tarry where I am. I need no nursingâif I did, there is Provision for it in my daughter's house. Go thou to bed! ELLEN. That cup has poison in it? WEILENBERG. Thou art not asked to drink with meâbe gone! Who taught to hide and listen? ELLEN. I meant no wrong; But thought my lord allowed of it. WEILENBERG. Hast heard What that man said? There are degrees of miseryâ Rest thou content with thine. ELLEN. Do you believe him? If so, be patient by the rule you give meâ There still is greater misery. WEILENBERG. Whose is so? ELLEN. Your daughter'sâshe is judged, and yet is guiltless! A father's curse is only less than God's: And you, who judge, will curse her! Trust her stillâ For her sake, and her mother's sake, forbear! O do not curse her, if she have done wrong! You two may meet no more. WEILENBERG. I judge and curse! Why thou fantastic foolâwho thought to curse her? Whatever she may do, I never will! One innocent spirit has fled the tyrannyâ The other changes in its just defence. This child was goodâI taught her to betray me. Even yet she pities me, and takes my part: She will not punish farther than is neededâ Her doors shall still be opened if I knock: I am shut out to humble me: she sees Her mother's tears. ELLEN. Would God you might see hers! WEILENBERG. Shouldst thou not wish me humbled? ELLEN. Not by her. WEILENBERG. By him through her. The worst, if others did it, Were light to what she doesâtherefore through her. ELLEN. She has not done it. WEILENBERG. Then she should have done. But this she shall not do, whatever else; She shall not nurse me, pity me, forgive meâ Receive me as an outcast home againâ Stand forth for intercession with the Count; Or chide his servants when they mock and brave me. I have been thought a man till late to-night: That traitor was the first who saw my tearsâ She works as nature teaches herâit is For retribution that she plagues me thusâ I killed her mother. ELLEN. You believe this kinsman? I dare not speak my thoughts, since that were sin. Your child must pray for those who wound to deathâ And so will IâMay God forgive his treachery! But still methought your lordship showed distrust? WEILENBERG. He is too vile for charity. ELLEN. Yet he is So much less wicked than this daughter is, That you believe in him? WEILENBERG. I am constrained To trust the aptitude of what he says, Not him. The gates might stand unwatchedâthey might By possibility at such a timeâ But who forewarned the Count to find them so? His entrance was no venture unpreparedâ He did not come till looked for. ELLEN. Whatâby her? Her mother's burial chosen for a fraud! A night to break her vows in! To betray Her promise then! The accuser knows 'tis false. Give me that cupâI ask it on my kneesâ For her sake who was blameless! WEILENBERG. Get thee hence! I thought thee wiser. ELLEN. Wait till Philip come! WEILENBERG. What art thou muttering ofââforbear!âbe patient!â Go, sleep these dreams away, and cease to tremble: What is that cup to thee?âBehold, I fright thee! ELLEN. Almost to death! Have pity! WEILENBERG. Leave me, then. ELLEN. If I may cast the poison from that cup, Or take it hence, I will. WEILENBERG. If thou do either I never will forgive theeâwhen it goes My curse goes with it. What afflicts thee thus? ELLEN. Because you change so soon from gentleness. WEILENBERG. Did I not tell thee so? Dost credit now? I said that I was cruel to the kind. The mother taught it to her child, and she, Who would have loved me, could not. ELLEN. Yet I know Her mother trusted to her love. WEILENBERG. I would trust too! It was my latest promise to them both! Thou pitiest herâI that have watched her sleep To earn the kiss she woke withâthat still hear Her little questions,âhow the flowers have thriven She planted yesterday, and when to feed The birds she tamed and nourishedâdost believe I leave her carelessly or love her less? I will retract injurious thoughts:âit is The cruel who makes the unfaithful. Thou wilt see herâ Say that I asked, not that I sent, forgiveness: Carry my blessing with theeâlet her think That needful grief has shamed and done me good. ELLEN. The wretch belies her! WEILENBERG. Hush, child! what is this? (Music is heard from the chapel.) ELLEN. The midnight service for the dead beginsâ I pray let both partake in it. WEILENBERG. Ayâhere. Its chaunt will reach me where I am. Wouldst teach To creep before the altar from these knavesâ Seek refuge in the sanctuary? ELLEN. Why not? WEILENBERG. The murderer would be found beside his workâ The dead lies there. Go thou, and pray for both. ELLEN. I dare not leave the cupâhave patience with meâ O father!âfather of that wretch, forbear! WEILENBERG. The drink is not my choice: 'twas sent, not asked for. Who gives it, will afford none else but shame: Shame first, and shortly bothâa shameful death. Away! I will not touch it till he come. Behold, so far is promised thee. (Exit Ellen.) Poor child! The best-beloved, because so like our own! This gentle creature is unhappy too; Our pride it is which makes our hearts so hard. I might have learnt to pity from the meek; Grief has been daily near enough! This chaunt, It wearies me; I have not slept of late. [Weilenberg sleeps. Enter Ellen. ELLEN. I am not needed, and I dare not stay. Asleep? or is this death? he has drunk, then! [She raises her veil. My father has deceived me!âyet he breathes! The cup seems still untasted. Change his heart, And O, be gracious, Thou that pitiest all! Now may I take it hence. [She removes, and then replaces the cup. His curse goes with it. Alas, his wrath pursues me if I do! He never will forgive me! yet to leave it! His curse, he said, goes with it! So to die!â Die cursed! I dare not take it hence! faint, sick! The table reels, or else my sight deceives me. (Ellen supports herself by leaning against the chair of her father, and sleeps. While the Priory clock loudly strikes twelve, the chaunt gradually dies away into music and voices more aÃ«rial.) Yield to sleepâfor sleep ye mustâ Neither counts that bell again. Earth to earth, and dust to dustâ The spirit takes its flight from pain. Three called, and one called thrice!âPrayer well has strivenâ Dread penitence at last prevailed. Come both with usâapproved, beloved, forgivenâ Tear-cleansed Remorse, and Faith unveiled. (The music is interrupted by loud knocking and voicesâthe Prioress entersâWeilenberg and Ellen start from sleepâ her veil drops.) WEILENBERG. O, tarry yet a moment!âbring them back!â Escaped!âart with us here?âthey all were here! ELLEN. My mother, help me! WEILENBERG. Child, we will go too. PRIORESS to Ellen. What now? Ah, fie upon thee!âhushâthine oath! WEILENBERG. I heard my daughter's voiceâshe called her mother. PRIORESS. Ay, my good lord, they always call me so. What ails thee, babbler? this wayâby the grate. [Pushes Ellen out. WEILENBERG. My daughter stood unveiledâthe rest around her! PRIORESS. We lack the time to speak of visions now. I pray take refuge till we see who knocks! WEILENBERG. No matter who it isâhe cannot harm us. They all were here! I heard my daughter's cryâ She stood beside me, and took hence the cup: I saw her tears. PRIORESS. It is that kinsman's voice. WEILENBERG. Then open to himâlet him in. A dream! [Exit Prioress. It was no dream, (he sees the cup) and yet the cup stands here! Enter Rudestein and Barbara. RUDESTEIN. Wilt fight or hide?âthis Count is at our heels. Then buckle well the cloak about thy neckâ Beware the river's fog, and catching cold! Late as it is, my cousin may sup at home. Nay, do thy message, simple oneâcome in! [He drags Barbara forward. What will avail this hanging of the head? My lady portress should have shut the gateâ Kept the Count out! BARBARA. If he deceived us all, Was the fault mine?âAm I as old as Ursula? RUDESTEIN. But who deceived the seneschal? Speak truth! My cousin's waiting maid beseeches grace: I met her where I landed from the boat, Augmenting Rhine with tears. Her mistress sends her Before the Count. WEILENBERG. What dost thou bring me from her? BARBARA. She prays remission, if she did amissâ For her your lordship's love, and for the Count More charitable thoughts than those of lateâ Release from blame for both. But first she asks That what is ill may not be cried abroad; And that your lordship will haste home again, Preventing what is threatened. WEILENBERG. What is that? BARBARA. Count Albert will be here the while I speak! I scarce outran him by the river's breadth. My lord shall sleep at home to night, he saysâ He swears it while he tarries for the boat! We have no time for choice of purer words; I speak my lady's sense in them. WEILENBERG. The rest Were near enough my wishesâbut those wordsâ I would not understand their sense!âTheir sound And that drugged cup awake me! Get thee back: I will not live a guest in mine own houseâ Tell thou thy mistress so. She turned me out To make me humblerâso far has been done. Now will I tarry where I amâhere rest Her mother, brothers, and, with them, myself. Yet would I live to see her once again; If but one moment, see her what she was, Or seemed to be, so late as yesterdayâ Believe her good, and think that still she loves me! RUDESTEIN. Now, by my soul, this house has hiding cavesâ Pit-falls and passages beneath the floor! I heard the same a second timeâsobs, criesâ Groans half-suppressed, yet audible! Look round; Behind the panel or beneath! What now? (A sudden tumult; loud voices heard, threats, and blows.) COUNT ALBERT, outside. I will come in. PRIORESS calls. My lord, the sanctuary! BARBARA. It is Count Albert! RUDESTEIN. He is come too soon! A breath too soon! Now what wilt do?âbe quick! Hold the door hard, Bab. WEILENBERG. Let the Count come in. RUDESTEIN. Drink first, or yield thyself: the bolts are burst! COUNT heard. Strike with the maces! break the panels in! RUDESTEIN. May everlasting curses light upon him! He ruins all! A coward!âdost fear to die? (to Weilenberg.) Drink! drink! wouldst live a spectacle? the cup! WEILENBERG. Away, thou traitor! let the Count come in. (While Weilenberg forces Rudestein and Barbara from the door, Ellen advances through the grate, takes the cup, drinks twice, the second time deliberately; then replaces it on the table, and sits in the chair which had been occupied by her father. Enter Count Albert, Philip, Hubert, Ursula, Prioress, and attendants.) WEILENBERG. I fain would see Count Albert face to face; He arms me 'gainst himself. [Weilenberg takes the empty cup, and gazes on Ellen. Hast thou done this? ELLEN. I neither took it hence, nor cast it out. Forbear to curse! WEILENBERG. What hast thou done? ELLEN. I drank That you might not drink. COUNT. Ursula, is this she? RUDESTEIN. A curse upon her meddling whosoe'er! 'Twas poison, fool. ELLEN. I know it. RUDESTEIN. Then let us see How well thy drink agrees with thee. [He snatches away the veil. WEILENBERG. My child! COUNT. What has she done? WEILENBERG. My daughter! PRIORESS. Poisoned! how? ELLEN. Father, I am not faithlessâlove me still! You prayed to see me once againâI knew No way but this. Ask Philip what I sworeâ The altar and the grave were witnesses: I did not dare to draw that veil aside. All night I have been with thee. COUNT. Poison! whence? ELLEN. The same you sent my father. COUNT. Poison! I! ELLEN. Let there be peaceâI am no hindrance now. COUNT. Who brought it hither? RUDESTEIN. I did, sirâI brought it; But warned my cousin that it came from you: Constrained I brought it. Help for Rolandseck! BARBARA. Help! rescue! help! (Rudestein draws, and attacks Count Albert, but is thrown down and disarmed by Hubert.) COUNT. Lay hold upon her too! PRIORESS to Weilenberg. My lord, I pray go hence. PHILIP. He hears thee not. His eyes are on that face which fades to death. I and mine oath have slain her! PRIORESS. Look, she smiles! WEILENBERG. Speak! canst not speak to me? URSULA. The dread of shameâ They forced the secret from me. ELLEN. Go not henceâ I do not see thee, Ursula; who is this? COUNT. Is there no help?âlook up. PRIORESS. Her sight is lost! ELLEN. My father, trust meâthat I always loved you. I am not faithlessâPhilip, speak for me. WEILENBERG. She says she loved meâyet one kiss, my child: Stand from herâlet her die. URSULA. Her breast is still: She breathes no more. PHILIP. Look, blood upon his lips! It floods and chokes him; help me, lest he fall. Murderer, not thouâstand off! (to the Count.) Move farther back! He would behold his daughter while he dies: [Weilenberg dies. His heart is burst. COUNT. I shall do one thing wellâ Better than better men might dare to do. Vengeance is justice here, if great enough. RUDESTEIN. The lord of Rolandseck defies thee still! I am myself such now. COUNT. The last thou shalt be. Place fetters on him, Hubert!âbind them both. This baron has a chamber built on highâ Its windows both one way, with briars beneath them, Where the rock mingles with the masonry. They shall lodge there locked in, the casements open. I will myself be chamberlain to-night, And walk before this Baron to his bed. Bear torches, Gregoryâlet the rest find wood, And drive the dwellers of the castle out. Set it on fire! [Exeunt Count, Rudestein, Barbara, and attendants. PHILIP. These two shall grieve no more! The sun will rise on roofless walls to-day! Terror has overcome me! Guileless lips Taught Faith its innocent Fraudâbut mine the vow Stronger than love or death! Their race is ended! THE END OF FAITH'S FRAUD.</field>
