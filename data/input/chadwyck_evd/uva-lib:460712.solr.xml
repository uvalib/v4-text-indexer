      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A Street in London. Enter Pembroke, Arundel, Wyatt, Jerningham, Bedingfield. BEDINGFIELD. Be well assured the King is sick to death. PEMBROKE. Tush, Sir, the King is young, and young blood fires Like flax. BEDINGFIELD. And dies as quickly. I repeat it, Even now the King lies at the point of death. WYATT. How can it be? But one short month it seems Since I beheld him on his jennet's back, With hawk on wrist, his bounding hounds beside, Charge up the hill side through the golden gorse, Swallowing the west wind, till his cheeks glowed out Like ripened pears. The whirring pheasant sprang From the hedged bank; and, with a shout, in air The bright boy tossed his falcon; then with spur Pressed to his jennet's flank, and head thrown back, And all the spirit of life within his eye And voice, he drew not rein, till the spent quarry Lay cowering 'neath the hawk's expanded wings. ARUNDEL. And what saith Sir John Cheke, his Grace's tutor? That one so apt to learn, mature in judgment, Ne'er hath o'erleaped the silken fence of childhood. WYATT. Too hotly from the deep well of his heart Boils up his fevered blood. BEDINGFIELD. You miss the mark! No fever pants upon King Edward's life; Nor natural decay hath drained his heart. PEMBROKE. Then, by the Rood! John Dudley must be questioned Wherefore he mews the King up thus at Greenwich, With beldams, herberers, and wizard quacks? BEDINGFIELD. Too late! the axe, henceforth, shall answer make To dangerous questioners. WYATT. He flies too high This modern Dedalus! ARUNDEL. O royal seed Of York and Lancaster, in Tudor blended, How are ye fallen, when this base minion churl, This felon-born, dares lift his ransomed hand Against your sacred houseâmisrules your peopleâ Usurps your sceptreâdecimates your peersâ Nay, holds the throne in his arbitrement! BEDINGFIELD. Ayeâthere you press the spring of his design. No child of the eighth Harry shall be Queen If Dudley's will be law. ARUNDEL. Pernicious Traitor! Much hath he dared! but with plebeian hand Dares he to clutch that crown the Norman rent From Harold's helmâand lion-hearted Richard Bore through the fields of Palestine redeemed, At Ascalon, in the Crusaders' van? O spirits of our old nobility! Rise from your tombs and blast this upstart carle! Mowbray is gone; but Thomas Howard lives! The suns of Bohun and de Clare have set; But Oxford's star beams brightly from his shield! Nevilles there be, though Warwick's veins are cold! Awake avengers! Bearders of kings arise! And crush the caitiff! BEDINGFIELD. One and all we join That cry, O Arundel! Well I remember When from the midst of English Gentlemen Great Somerset, the Uncle of the King, Was, like some stag, the captain of the herd, Torn down and throttled by this blood-hound Dudley! How flashed your eyes above your half-drawn sword, While muttered malisons hissed through your teeth! WYATT. Sirs, be ye calm, probing the kingdom's hurt. She whom this Dudley wills to wear the crown Descends, through Tudor, from Plantagenet: And the two Roses on so fair a cheek As Lady Jane's, the Duke of Suffolk's daughter, Have never blended. ARUNDEL. The Duchess' mother livesâ PEMBROKE. Nor sheânor any daughter of her houseâ Not my son's wife, shall ever be my Queen! WYATT. Beshrew King Harry! had he loved one wifeâ Or crowned no concubineâour course were plain. But nowâIn sooth I trow not if to marry One's brother's wife, be uncanonical, But this I know, howe'er legitimate, The Lady Mary's neither young nor fair, But black Papistical. The Lady Bess Loves the true Church, and is as fair withal As her frail mother Boleyn. BEDINGFIELD. There's the rub. Too sweetly Boleyn smiled on Harry's wooing Ere he was severed by sufficient warrant From the crowned Queen. But six short months divided The bridal and the birth. Elizabeth May not be hailed legitimately Queen: But who shall gainsay Mary? WYATT. That dare I? Unless the sacred charter of our church Be well assured. If not, the Suffolk line, The blood of Grey, aye, Dudley's, I prefer. JERNINGHAM. Sir Thomas Wyatt, you presume too far; Disparaging the royal Mary's claimâ Which I averâ ARUNDEL. O peace! the time needs union. Waste not in idle brawls your generous ardour. But lift your swords, and swear, kissing the hilts, That England shall not be a Traitor's preyâ Nor Tudor's heritage adorn a Grey! [Exeunt. Scene II. Greenwichâthe King's Bedchamber. King Edward on a Couch: Lady Jane reading. JANE. How fares your Highness now? EDWARD. Thy sweet voice, Jane, Soothes every pain. A film grew o'er mine eyes; A murmur, as of breezes on the shore, Or waters lapping in some gelid cave, Coiled round my temples; and I slept. JANE. Ah cousin! Not in my voice the charm. Within this volume A sanatory virtue lives enshrined, As in Bethesda's pool. EDWARD. By an angel stirred! I sleptâmethought the merry, chiming birds Were round me, and the bleating of the lambs, And cheerful harmony of hounds and horn. And murmuring winds, and waters among trees, Making the diapason of our Earth; While by my side dear Uncle Somerset Rode, stately with grave smile. Where is he now? Ah, fatal falsehoods! fatal credulity! Look at this hand! health withered in its veins Signing the unnatural warrant. JANE. Judge less hardly. You were the instrument, but not the doer, In that bad deed. EDWARD. I am too youngâtoo young For sorrow and remorse; yet both are here! I yearn for freedom, like some callow scholar Over his task perplexed; and it will come. Soon shall I leap forth like the lark at morn Into the pathless skyâand through the gates Of light, onâonâto heaven! Hark! some noise. Who thus disturbs the last rest of a King? Enter Northumberland and Cranmer. NORTHUMBERLAND. We come, my liege, deputed by the Council, To lay before your Grace the realm's sad state Thus widowed of your presence; and abashed By the frowns of coming wrong. Am I permitted? EDWARD. Permitted? ah my Lord, custom permitsâ You seldom tread the paths of ceremony. Say onâmy soul is sad, but I will hear you. NORTHUMBERLAND. My Lord Archbishop will explain how far Zeal strengthens us to stem the tide of evils Which, should it please high heaven to take your Grace, Your death would loose upon us. CRANMER. May I speak? We pray you judge, should harm befall your Grace, The dangers of the Church; no pious Prince, Versed in true doctrine of our Faith, succeeding. How ill the Lady Mary stands affected Unto the Church is known. Elizabeth Gives, peradventure, better hope; but here Their claims make up a tissue so perplexed The undoing of the woof destroys the web. We must eschew both, or hold fast to both. And thus by right of primogeniture The Lady Mary at our peril succeed. NORTHUMBERLAND. Mark well! to England's and the Church's ruin! CRANMER. Now well we know, a wise Prince and religious, God's glory and his kingdom's weal endangered, Will put aside all weak respects of bloodâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Else would God's vengeance mete out doom hereafter! CRANMER. But other hope remains. Three noble daughters Of Suffolk's bed are of the royal lineage: Most near, and by their virtues well commended. Through theseâ JANE. Nay! I must speak. My Lord Archbishop, I must protestâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Be silent: the church speaks! CRANMER. Through these nor persecutor of our faith, Nor foreign yoke, through marriage may be feared: For these have been brought up with spiritual food; Suckled with christian doctrine undefiled; And matched with husbands zealous for the truth. That these, firm pledged the true Church to maintain, Should be successively the kingdom's heirs Most humbly we advise: and for this Lady, Eldest of that illustrious house, Jane Grey, If all her virtues, which speak trumpet-tongued, Suffice not, we, her father, all the Council, The Peers of England, yea the Realm itself, Impledge our lives to back her constancy! JANE. O no! not me! This remediless wrong I have no part in. Edwardâyou have sisters: Great Harry's daughter'sâEngland's manifest heirs. Leave right its way, and God will guard His own! NORTHUMBERLAND. The manifest heirs of England! tush! you see not The very point at issue. Counsellors Learned in the laws, hold the king's heir to be Whom the king's testament shall nominate. Besides, the child of the incestuous Katherine May not be Queen: nor wanton Boleyn's daughter. CRANMER. Too harshly spoken! Hold him up! he faintsâ Soâhe revivesâSir, look upon this Lady, This Angel that shall win a crown in heaven, Worthier than all of Earth! King Edward! hear me! Uphold your people in her! EDWARD. God be my guide! Now and forever! Sense and thought forsake me. O sisters! ye desert me! yet I love yeâ How much I love! NORTHUMBERLAND. They come not at your bidding. Your People be your care. EDWARD. Ah yesâmy People! To them, and to my Godâbe duty done! NORTHUMBERLAND. Sign thenâ JANE. Sign not! EDWARD [signing]. Come weal, come woeâ'tis signed! Now take me, Lord, from this calamitous life! Yet if to live and suffer be thy will, And to thy chosen People serviceable, I am contented to abide, and serve. Enter from the side, the Princess Mary, followed by Bedingfield, Jerningham and Fakenham. At lastâand yet too lateâI bless thee, sister! Why comes not Bess? BEDINGFIELD. She lay, my Liege, too far From Framlingham, and time, so rumour ran, Pressed hardly on your Grace. MARY [kissing Edward]. How wan! how wasted! My dear, lost brother! [Northumberland attempts to pass out. BEDINGFIELD. Go not forth, my Lord, While here her Highness stays. NORTHUMBERLAND. How, Varlet, how? Who shall debar my way? BEDINGFIELD. I willâ JERNINGHAM. And I. EDWARD. What means this timeless brawl? Northumberland, I deemed my sister's visit due to thee: Whence then this heat? I am too weak to bear it. MARY. My Lord of Lisle! orâpardon meâLord Duke! (To such a height your style hath grown, I learn) Your message cameâand I am here! but not Without precaution that secures return. NORTHUMBERLAND. Madam, you err: know your friends better. MARY. Yes. I know them at their worth. NORTHUMBERLAND. Lady, you mark not His Grace's weak estate. I seek no brawlâ And fear no foe. MARY. God's death! my Lord, nor I! I bid you silence, Sir. NORTHUMBERLAND. What? menace me? BEDINGFIELD. Beware this swordâif you advance, it strikes! JANE. O peace, good father, peace! the King sinks fast. MARY. Perils beset meâscorning all I come: Shall I abide with thee? EDWARD. This gentle Jane Hath been a sister in my sister's absence. MARY. Why was I bade to go? He bade me fly,â Ah Traitor! [pointing to Northumberland. EDWARD. It is now too lateâtoo late! I have done what it were well had ne'er been done. JANE. O would to God that act might be recalled! MARY. What act? JANE. That makes me Queen. MARY. Thou Queen! O never Shall regal crown clasp that unwrinkled brow! Thou Queen? go, girlâbetake thee to thy mappets! Call Ascham backâphilosophizeâbut never Presume to parley with grey counsellors, Nor ride forth in the front of harnessed knights! Leave that to me, the daughter of a King. EDWARD. I have wronged thee to save the state from wrong. I had much to say; but faltering thought and tongue Forbid. Never shall foreign Prince or Prelate Bear sway in England. So my father willed. Cranmer, speak thou. NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, I speak now. The King Still, madam, proffers hope, on penitence. The crown may yet be your'sâthis act annulled; If here before this dying Saint, in presence Of this most holy Prelate, and this Lady Wise past her years, your errors you renounce. MARY. Sir, have you done? simply I thus reply. Not to drag England from this slough of treasonâ Nor save this lady's headânor your's, Archbishop;â Not even my brother's lifeâwould I abjure My faith, and forfeit heaven! CRANMER. Pause, proud Lady! The end hath come. Lo! one among us stands Chainer of every tongue! queller of Princes! One moment more, and penitence were vain. [All kneel by the King's couch. EDWARD. Lord! keep thy People steadfast in the Faith! I dieâbless allâJesus receive my soul. [Dies. CRANMER. He's dead!âand never passed a purer spirit, Stored with more graces of humanity, More fraught with truths divine, than this lost King. For he was grave, as well beseemed a King, Though joyous in his spirit as a child. Of wit so keen, that all expectancy Of nature was outstripped: and thus he dies Consumed in his own brightness. Had he lived The sweet conditions of ingenuous nature Had won all good men's love, as they have long The hope of all the learned: for he began To favour learning ere he knew it fully; And knew, ere time remained to use it well. Too soon he dies! yet not without memorials That shall be storied long and treasured fondly. He lacked but time to leave the world example Of all a King, so trained and graced, might be! MARY. And thou art gone! hast left me unforgiven!â O brother! was this righteous? gloomier now This dreary world frowns on me, and its cares. Womanly dreams, farewell! stern truths of life Stamp on my heart all that becomes a Queen! Dudley, you have dared much; yet, standing here By my poor brother's clay, I can forgive. Will you kneel, Dudley? NORTHUMBERLAND. Never to theeâbut hereâ To Jane, true Queen I kneel. God save Queen Jane! BEDINGFIELD. Ha! traitor! MARY. Sheath your swords! here, in Death's chamber, Blood must not flow. NORTHUMBERLAND. No traitor I. I spurn Your favour, even with these oddsâaway! Keep from my path, Fakenham and Bedingfield, Or by my surging hopes I strike you dead! Ho! Guards, without! Guilford! your wife to rescue! MARY. Again I sayâhere shed no blood for me! JERNINGHAM. I hear thick beating footsteps on the stairâ My liege, 'tis time to fly. NORTHUMBERLAND. I stay you notâ Begone! [Exit Mary attended. FAKENHAM. We meet hereafter! NORTHUMBERLAND. Out, vile worm! No deed of mine mates me with thee hereafter. FAKENHAM. I spake not of that judgement. We shall meet In this worldâby the scaffoldâat the grave. [Exit. Enter Lord Guilford Dudley, Pembroke, Guards. GUILFORD. What means this tumultâthy distracted bearing? NORTHUMBERLAND. The king is dead. GUILFORD. By you? NORTHUMBERLAND. He died by nature. The Queen hath scaped. GUILFORD. The Queen! my Jane is Queen. What mean you? NORTHUMBERLAND. Tushâthe tongue misquotes the mind. I spake of Mary Tudor. GUILFORD. Maryâhere? NORTHUMBERLAND. AyeâTraitors are within these gates: look round. I like not Pembroke's mienânor Winchester's. I am glad she stayed not here. Urge no pursuit. The eighth Harry's soul lives in her voice and eye. It were not well if she had stayedâand lived. [He muses for a time. [Aside.] We lack but timeâtime satisfies all scruplesâ Silence in treason is complicity:â Whoso connives conspires. [Aloud] You know, my Lords, The late King's testament. It pleased the Council. Pembroke, your son stands on the throne's first step. PEMBROKE. Which yours doth mount. NORTHUMBERLAND. Holding it safe for your's. We'll talk of this hereafter: now our cares Attend the late king's obsequies. My Lord Of Winchester, be pleased to marshal forth The sad procession to the Tower. Within The chapel lay the body, near the altar; Light tapers, and let solemn psalms be sung. Guilford, attend the Queen. Pembroke, we'll talk Of these things privily. Herbert already, As next of blood, is Captain of the guard: Suffolk Lord Constable: youâdear friend! choose. What Pembroke asks can grateful Jane refuse? [Exeunt severally. Scene III. Chamber in the Tower. Enter Northumberland. NORTHUMBERLAND. These branching passages, and tortuous stairs, And dark, low chambers (ghostly dens) confound me. Methought the way to Courtenaye's cell was plain. I have missed the clue: I'll rest me here awhile. The Race of Dudley mountsâHad Jane no scruplesâ Were Guilford wise as he is plausible, Then were this new-cemented fabric firm, And founded for endurance. Not so now. Yet 'twas a glorious sight! Jane crowned and plumed, On her proud palfreyâmy fair son beside herâ Scarce less even now than KingâEngland's broad banner Flouting the wind beforeâa goodly sight! But something lacked there: and that something grows Ghost-like on questioning thought. From that great host No greeting rose. Base hirelings only cheered. The pageant drew the people, brought no hearts. Therefore I seek young Courtenaye's cell; last heir Of the Plantagenets and line of York. He owes no grudge to me. Harry the Eighth Loved not so fair a kinsman near the throne; So slew his father, stout King Edward's grandson. With Courtenaye then make I compact alliance. The man is fair, nor overwise; and rumour Whispers that Mary Tudor likes him well. If Fortune fail, this princely fool my friendâ A woman for my foeâWhat light is that? [Pushes a door open: finds a Headsman sharpening his axe. HEADSMAN. Plague on youâyou disturb my trade. NORTHUMBERLAND. How now? HEADSMAN. God save you, good my Lord. I knew you not. NORTHUMBERLAND. Why look you on my throat so fixedly? HEADSMAN. Pardon, my Lord, it is a trick grew on me Long years agone: it came when I cut offâ NORTHUMBERLAND. What came, what came? HEADSMAN. Ah Sir! you'll not believe me. 'Twas but a double dealing of the eye, Feigning a red line round a shapely throat. I saw Anne Boleyn thus when she was crownedâ And she was done to deathâwas it not strange? So Katherine Howard seemed at her last feastâ And she was done to deathâand by this hand. So seemed, when standing by his nephew's throne, The great Protector Somersetâand heâ NORTHUMBERLAND. No more of this. I seek Lord Devon's cell. HEADSMAN. This way, my Lord. NORTHUMBERLAND. Portents and warnings mock usâ Away! light omens shake not this firm heart. [Exeunt. Scene IV. Exeter's Cell in the Tower. EXETER. Stepsânot my wardersâhearkenâtwo are coming, What next befalls? all day strange sounds were rise; Trumpets and ordnance. What's to me who reigns Or dies, or marries? all the sorry chances Of courtly life! mayhap a King is murdered: 'Tis probableâthe commonest accident! Or Queen beheaded: well, if none but Queens, I might not quarrel with the royal pastime. Enter Northumberland and Headsman. Ha! I should know that face; and lackeyed thus By yon grim doomster, guess my coming fate. NORTHUMBERLAND. I greet you well, Lord Marquess Exeter! Noble Plantagenet! EXETER. Hey! what means this? The half-forgotten nameâand fatal heritage! Sir John of Dudleyâbear and ragged staff!â Or memory fails me. NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, Northumberland. EXETER. Indeed? excuse me: prisoners limp behind The vaulting world. You are welcome. NORTHUMBERLAND. I would greet you With tidings of content. EXETER. Long strangers here! NORTHUMBERLAND. I take your hand: nor coldly, thus, hereafter Will you, perchance, vouchsafe it. I have power; (In Edward's time I only had the will) To serve you. EXETER. Ha! how well I guessed the truth! One King the more is dead! who now rules England! Chaste Boleyn's babeâor the Arragonian whelp? No beauty I'll be sworn, unless Time makes one. NORTHUMBERLAND. The House of Grey is of the royal lineage. To that King Edward's will bequeaths the crown. EXETER. My lady Duchess Queen?âNow God forbid! NORTHUMBERLAND. All cry amen to thatâHer Grace of Suffolk Yields to her wiser daughterâLady Janeâ My son, Lord Guilford's wife; now Queen of England. EXETER. O now I do begin to read the stars, And note what constellation climbs. My Lord, Excuse the stiffness of imprisoned knees. The obsolete posterity of Kings, Lowly should bend to Kings' Progenitors. Sir Headsman! art thou married? HEADSMAN. Nay, my Lord. EXETER. Get thee a wife then, in good haste: get sons! Full-bosomed honour, like a plant in the sun, Plays harlot to the hour. Lo! thistles burgeon Even through the red Rose' cradle! NORTHUMBERLAND. My good Lord, Unseasonable wit hath a warped edge, Whereby the unskilful take unlooked for scars. Good nightâmay fancy tickle you in dreams, In which nor Boleyn's babe (I quote your phrase) Nor whelp of Arragonâkind Heaven forfend! Nor our grim friend here, with uncivil axe, Dare mingle. Good night, Courtenaye! EXETER. Stay, Sir, stayâ NORTHUMBERLAND. If at your biddingâyet bethink you well, This trick of irony is dangerous. Had you not guessed me for a friend, 'twere fatal To have used it thusââThe whelp of Arragon!â âChaste Boleyn!â What if blood of these shall chance To grace, or blot,â(the thought was your's) the throne? Were Dudley not a friend, these words might slay you! EXETER. Be blisters on my lips! NORTHUMBERLAND. The rather salve them: And for your best physician know John Dudley. Henceforth we are as oneânayâmark me, Devonâ Or friends or foes! Are we as one? Why now, This hand I clasp, and to my living heart Fold it; in pledge of lasting amity. So for short space, farewell! I go to plead Your cause before the Council, and my daughter' Queen Janeâyour loving kinswoman. Good night! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. The Hall of Framlingham. Enter Queen Mary Tudor attended. MARY. Why is Elizabeth not here to greet me? Command her to the Presence. Bedingfield These midnight ridings, imminent escapes, Make the heart quiver, and flushed temples throb. To the chapel, Fakenham: I would fain disburthen This sinful heart, and tortured brain, of all The imp-like fancies of this perilous nightâ Night, that with penitence must be atoned. JERNINGHAM [entering]. Sir Thomas Wyatt craves immediate audience. MARY. Religion claims us first. Let Wyatt wait. JERNINGHAM. He will not move his power, until assured The Church as stablished by the late King's law, Shall be upheld. MARY. May God assoilzie him! And mend Sir Thomas Wyatt! Bid him wait. JERNINGHAM. My liegeâ MARY. Sir Henry Jerningham, I have said. Enter Elizabeth. ELIZABETH [kneeling]. Queen, Sister! MARY. To my arms! Pardie! sweet Bess, You daily grow more stately. Your great brows, Like our Cathedral porches, double-arched, Seem made for passage of high thought. ELIZABETH. Regard me Only as a sister: yet, if you need, or seek My counsel, it is thine, MARY. Nay, nay, fair girl, My counsel is with bearded warriours, And grey-cowled wisdom. ELIZABETH. Be it as you will. MARY. Yet never was kind counsel needed more By aching heart. Little you know my trials. The fleetness of my horse scarce saved my life; And I am Queen in nothing but the name! Go friendsâI would be lonely in my sorrowâ O Sister! canst thou love me? thou her childâ Beautiful Boleyn's daughter! who destroyed My motherâhapless Queenâdishonoured wife! Thou tooâmy brotherâspurned from thy throne, thy deathbed. O no! I shall go down into my earth DesolateâunbelovedâI wound thee, sister! Pardon! I raveâI raveâ ELIZABETH. Abate this passion! In very truth I love youâfondly pityâ MARY. Pity! not pityâgive me love or nothing! I hope not happiness: I kneel for peace. But no: this crown traitors would rive from meâ Which our great father Harry hath bequeathed Undimned to usâa righteous heritageâ This crown which we, my sister, must maintain Or die; this crown true safeguard of our Peopleâ Their charter's sealâcrushes our peace for ever. All crowns, since Christ wore his, are lined with thorns. Elizabeth! that book-demented Jane Dares mount our father's throne: these base new lords (Sprung from our house's fatal policy) Turn from our nurturing hand to kiss her feet! Elizabeth! though thousands back the upstart, With hundreds, only, round us, we will smite her! ELIZABETH. I love, and will maintain in front of battle, This spirit, as befits our house. MARY. Ha! ha! The cross shall lead our battle! In the van Shall flame the holy sign! Elizabeth! Thou shalt be with meâthou! albeit thy mother Bequeathed her misbelief to thee. Beneath The Cross Pontifical we'll tread to dust Those sordid Puritans: thou lov'st them not. Enter Fakenham. Lo, in good time thou comest to register My vow. ELIZABETH. This rage o'ermasters you: yet pause; Pause 'till with calmer reasonâ MARY. Am I mad? Think you I'm mad? I have been used to scornâ Neglectâoppressionâself-abasementâaye, My mother's scorching heritage of woe! Ha! as I speak, beholdâshe visits meâ With that fair choir of Angels trooping round her, And cherub faces, with expanded wings Upbearing her! O blessed saint! depart not! Breathe on my cold lips those still cherished kisses Which thine in death impressed! Sigh in my ear Those half articulate blessings, unforgotten, Which made my childhood less than martyrdom! I'll clasp theeâMother! [Totters forward and falls. ELIZABETH. Soft: she revives again. Give no alarm. Observed you this before? FAKENHAM. Not thus demented. ELIZABETH. You mistake. Her spirit Though masculine as well becomes a Tudor, Yet will her fragile body bend in storms. Already she revives: be prudent, Sir. MARY [recovering]. Good father, why this look of grief? My sister, A grave rebuke looks coldly from your eye. Ah well, you smile! you love me in my weakness. Give me your armâI need refreshmentâsleep. [Exeunt. Scene II. The Open Country in Suffolk. Enter Wyatt, Brett, and followers. BRETT. I tell thee, Wyatt, these my saucy knaves Of London City brook no tedious parleys. It addles clearer heads than ours to scan Your knotty quodlibets, with such a coil Of clerkly terms, and law-court jargonry, Citings of title, precedents and casesâ Here Janeâthere Maryâwell we've ta'en our part, And here we stand right manfully for Mary. You bid us wait. 'Sdeath, sir, have we not waited These twenty hours sans sleep, sans food, sans wineâ Scant welcome for substantial citizens! I pray you judge this matter reasonablyâ WYATT. The Queen, last night, care-worn and sad, perforce Declined our audience: in an hour she grants it. BRETT. The hours here lost were preciousâ WYATT. Well, they were soâ But here comes Jerningham. What news? Enter Jerningham before Mary, Elizabeth, &amp;c. JERNINGHAM. The Queen! MARY. We greet you well, our faithful Londoners! You, Master Brettâand you, Sir Thomas Wyatt. Why ask ye audience? time it were for action. WYATT. We come prepared for deeds; but first, frank speech. I am too bold I fear me. MARY. So fear I. WYATT. These men had godly training from their cradles; And, Madam, before all things they love God. That they stand here attests their loyalty. Your Grace's claim is rightful: Lady Jane's We, on deliberation, disallow. MARY. We are beholden to you: but our right Divine, needs not arbitrement of men. Say on. WYATT. I speak, my liege, as I am charged: The mouth-piece of these noble hearts, impledged To back you, but with conscience satisfied. We grieve to see the royal banner bear The holy cross with Peter's keys impaledâ An emblem which we dare not march beneath. I am bound to tell you, madam, we raise not Our weapons in a cause not wholly righteous: Wherefore we crave your royal gauge that all things Which touch the Church, rest as King Edward left them. MARY. Gentlemen!âyea, to English Gentlemen Your Queen, in her extremity of wrong, Is forced to make appeal. Ye press me hardly. Pleading your conscience, Sirs, think too of mine. You grasp at license: take it: but deny not The liberty ye crave. Little know ye By what vexations royalty is compassed; Or what my special trials. You, as yet Little enforced, are firm. I too am firm: And firm have stood in dire extremity; Perilling all for conscience' sake. For this Will Englishmen desert me? Something moves youâ Why murmur ye aside? BRETT. My Lady Queen? These men of mine, excuse their city habitsâ Make much of bargain and securities. They pray your highness for explicit pledges. MARY. Out on ye, men of pelf! shall loyalty Be measured out at price? with legal phrase Indentured, and set forth like some vile bond! You speak as though your Queen stood not on right, In panoply of arms and regal state; But, cap in hand, pleaded through her attorney.â I'll not be interruptedâsilence sir! I scorn to buy my rights. I'll hear no more! My Lord of Arundel, advance our banner! Follow for your hereditary faithâ To Londonâforward! ARUNDEL. Wyatt, be our guide: And Captain Brett shall guard the rear. BRETT. Lord Marshal, The city bands listen no voice but mine. MARY. God's death! you dare to parley, Master Brett? Obey our Marshalâorâ BRETT [sheathing his sword]. I march no farther! WYATT. Nor Iâyet on my knees, I pray you, Madam; Relentâyou will not? Even yet my prayers Shall be for your success, though in this quarrel I may not strike. MARY. False to thy God art thou, Deserting thus in presence of the foe! Yon bartering churls obey their natural instinct. But thouâof noble bloodâSir! yon's the road To our revolted Cousin. She, perchance May hedge her bauble crown with pageant peers. Go Sir! a coronet, or axe, awaits you. Begone! you bar our way. WYATT. Alas! my liege, How much you misconceive us time will show. Come, Master Brettâyet hear me, Arundel: We march, 'tis true, apart from your main battle, But yet so near your flank none shall assail it. [Turning to Elizabeth. I speak in honour; trust me. Gracious Lady Plead thou. ELIZABETH. Arise, I pray: what power have I? WYATT. Tell her how many thousand English babes, Now dancing on their father's knees, shall weep In orphanage for thisâhow many wives Shall tear their widowed locks o'er bloody graves, If this our Queen let loose upon her land The dogs of persecution, late chained down, Insatiate brood of Rome! MARY. Now, by the Rood! This is too much. Arrest him! ELIZABETH. Pardon, Sister: He knows not what he says. MARY. Traitor, begone! For once I spare. Advance, I say, our banner! Up Tudor Dragon in rebellion's face! Up, crowned Portcullis, guardian of the right! Strike for King Harry's memory, loyal soldiers! Strike for King Harry's daughter, grateful servants! Strike for the violated law, bold yeomen! And ye, the church's faithful champions, strike For the true Cross and the authentic Faith! [Exeunt Mary and Elizabeth. BRETT. Now, by all saints and martyrs calendared! I could half worship such a tameless woman; All shrewish though she be. With what a spirit Like thunder-riven cloud her wrath poured forth, And keen words flared! Ugly and old?âto that I shall say nay hereafter. Autumn moons Portend good harvests. Yet, that glance at parting Flashed, fierce as sunset through a blasted tree! But hey! look yonder, Wyatt: half your men Are scampering after her. WYATT. I marked, and blame not. I mar no fortune, and coerce no conscience. There is a fascinationâall have felt itâ When Royalty and Woman join in one; Austere allegiance softening into love; And new-born fealty clinging to the heart Like a young babe that from its mother's bosom Looks up and smiles. BRETT. Trust me, I am much minded To join her even yet. WYATT. It cannot be. I feel as you do: but I look beyond The tempting present. She goes forth to conquer: So strong a heart must conquerâthen, what then? Ah! know you not the indomitable spirit Which scorns all danger, spurns all compromise, Is born for stern resolve, deeds pitiless? All must be feared from spiritual despotismâ The axe, the stake, tortures, apostasy! BRETT. Wyatt, I hate you when you play the augur. WYATT. The weight is on my heart of coming doom! [Exeunt. Scene III. The Tower Chapel. King Edward's coffin lying in state. Priests, Heralds, Choristers, &amp;c. CHOIR. Woe, woe, unto the people! from our head The crown hath fallen; our laurel wreath lies dead! Our vine that yielded shade and fruit Hath perished from the root! ANTICHOIR. The Lord from out his temple spake in vain: Vainly his prophets threat, his priests complain! From wisdom all avert the ear; The froward will not hear! CHOIR. We preached God's wrath; and bade without delay, The carnal heart turn from his evil way. For surely God's avenging hand Smites every guilty land. ANTICHOIR. And He hath sternly smitten; as of old, When stout Josiah perished from the fold; And Jeremiah's deep lament With Israel's weeping blent. CHOIR. Woes have begun; our sorrows multiply; Our terrors and our penitential cry! For well we know we but begin To pluck the fruits of sin. ANTICHOIR. But oh! ye sorrow-laden! kneel in prayer That He, who once redeemed you, still may spare! The vials of thy wrath no more, Lord, on thy people pour! CRANMER. Weep, though in vain, poor hearts! cry forth your sorrow, Like mendicants that at the temple gates Compassion crave from every passenger! And ye who shroud your grief in your close hearts, The rather let it stream forth from your eyes; Eased by the general sympathy. Enter Northumberland. NORTHUMBERLAND. How's this? Why these desponding tones? Lives not the Queen? A VOICE. Long live the rightful Queen! NORTHUMBERLAND. King Edward dead, Queen Jane is Queen: I say the rightful Queen. Your lamentable passion was too loud, For sadness to lie deep; and ill comports With heedful loyalty. But be you joyful, Even in the honoured presence of the dead. It is the Living, not the Dead who reigns: Kneel not, then, to the coffin, but the throne. She comes! ye trumpeters, awake the air With cheerful clangour, and salute the Queen! A VOICE. Is this a place for cheer? O vanity Of vanities! NORTHUMBERLAND. Who twice thus dares my anger? FAKENHAM. Hereafter I shall speak more plainly. [Exit. NORTHUMBERLAND. Seize him! Enter Jane as Queen, led by Lord Guilford Dudley, attended by Duchess of Suffolk, &amp;c. &amp;c. JANE [suddenly stopping with a strong shudder]. What's this? who has done this? a sorry trick To fright me so! NORTHUMBERLAND. Why looks our Jane so pale? My Liegeâyour pardon! I forgotâbut why That blank look on the ground? JANE [rubbing her eyes]. 'Tis goneâ'tis gone! Yet noâ'tis there again! dread omen! NORTHUMBERLAND. Give me Your hand, my liege. [Aside] Arouse thee child! remember The eyes of thousands search thee through and through. Sleep-walker! must I lead thee? JANE [drawing back.] Noânot there! I step not there! NORTHUMBERLAND [aside]. Art mad? JANE. I think I amâ Mother! DUCHESS. My child! what means this terror? JANE. Mother! As I stand here and live, I saw it there. A bloody axeâthere on that floorâIt may beâ It was illusionâyesâI know 'twas soâ But I am sorely shakenâBear with my weaknessâ O Mother, O Northumberland! mark now The issue of your plots. Thou knowest, God! That I am innocent of this offence! This crown, this coffin-throne, this phantom-axe, I sought not,â NORTHUMBERLAND. Have a care. Pause ere you spurn them. Each backward step is to your husband's grave. You are moved: you yield: come on! JANE. God succour me! NORTHUMBERLAND. [Leading Jane to the head of the bier. Barons of England! Prelates of the Church! Accept Your Queen! God save Queen Jane of England! [Partial acclamations. The Queen is thankful for her people's greeting; As after deeds shall prove. At her command I lay, my lords, King Edward's Will before you. This noble deed, so fraught with prescient wisdom, Discreet discrimination of the Law, Regard for ancientness and precedent, Love for his people rather than his kin, And, above all, true zeal for holy church, Shall stand a monument, our christian charter, Pride of all English hearts. My Lords, I use No trope of phantasy, bombastic phrase, But speak plain truth in language plain, affirming The Nation's with the Church's weal bound up, Both with this Queen's succession. Take this deed, Lawfully drawn, authentically vouched; And here delivered to the assembled State In presence of the Dead, whom we adjure, And of the living Princess whom we serve. Peers, Knights, and Burgesses, behold your Queen! KING AT ARMS. Hear all ye people! Look upon your Queen! The high and mighty Princess, Lady Jane, Grand-daughter of your late King Henry the seventh, By right of blood, and by King Edward's will, Queen of this realm of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith! God save the Queen! CHAMPION OF ENGLAND. [Throwing down his glove. Which I avouch against all adversaries! NORTHUMBERLAND. And I make good against a host in arms! [Partial acclamations. FAKENHAM. Hear me, ye men of England! Hear, Jane Grey, One honest, faithful voice. NORTHUMBERLAND. Back, miscreant! darest thou Withhold her title from the Lord's anointed? FAKENHAM. Anointed notânor will be! a vain title, Blown like a bubble from the popular breath, Makes not a Queen: but lineal blood, liege love, And consecration by the Churchâthat Church Which on the rock stands firm, and holds the keys! I fear you not, Duke of Northumberland! My trust is Godâand, under God, this Lady; A victim, not a traitress! NORTHUMBERLAND. Seize, and slay him! What ho! the Captain of the Guard! PEMBROKE. Not soâ My son is not an executioner. Pause, good my Lord: this passion shakes her Grace. NORTHUMBERLAND. Bar not my way! PEMBROKE. The time, the place, the presence! A brawl of blood before the coffined King, And a throned Queen! [To Herbert] Remove the fanatic Make room for the regalia! Officers enter with the regalia; which they present kneeling. The Nobility then come forward, orderly, to perform homage. NORTHUMBERLAND [kneeling]. In the name Of England's Peerage, I salute the Queen; And, kneeling on this consecrated earth, Do swearâ PEMBROKE [sneeringly]. Not consecrated earth, my Lord! Her Grace's foot is on Anne Boleyn's graveâ And yours on the Protector Somerset's! NORTHUMBERLAND. Accursed night of omens! [Starting up. PEMBROKE. Pardon, my Lord,â Her Grace expects the interrupted oath. NORTHUMBERLAND. I'll have no more! break up the ceremonyâ What noise is that? PEMBROKE. Something hath moved the crowd. Silent it stood but late in street and court With upturned faces gleaming to the moon; So motionless and passive, their inaction Trust me, was awful. Now their coldness thaws; And, like a snow-slip down the mountain side, Thundering they rush, choking the narrow ways. NORTHUMBERLAND. Event treads down eventâShut gates! up drawbridge! Enter a Warder accompanied by a Courier. NORTHUMBERLAND. What slave thus startles our solemnities? Bird of ill omen, speak! COURIER. Sir Edward Hastingsâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha! what of Hastings? I much trusted Hastingsâ With manifold commissionsâ COURIER. He hath joined The Lady Mary, with four thousand men. NORTHUMBERLAND. Lay hands upon his brother Huntingdon! Enter a second Courier. NORTHUMBERLAND. Varlet! what evil croak is thine? SECOND COURIER. Your ships, Which lately buffeted the German sea, By stress of tempests driven to Yarmouth roads, Have yielded to Sir Henry Jerningham. Enter a third Courier. NORTHUMBERLAND. Whatâmore disasters? THIRD COURIER. The Lord Grey of Wilton Bade me report, the Earls of Bath, and Surrey, Joined to Sir William Drury, Sir John Skelton, And others, men of note, proclaim Queen Mary. NORTHUMBERLAND. Their heads shall wither on these towers for this!â Arm, arm, my Lords! Rebellion is in arms! And like a reptile must be trod to death. Suffolk! tis thine to lead thy daughter's battle, To victoryâto vengeance! PEMBROKE. Hear calm counsel. Madam, your father ought to guard your person. No heart so loving, and no faith so trusty, As is a father's. Furthermore, where arms In the ranged field must arbitrate, a Leader Of marked renown should guide: one whose known pennon Shakes terror from its folds. Northumberland Is Captain of the age. NORTHUMBERLAND. I go not. Madam, The soul of safety severs from its body If I depart. Within this city lurk Malcontent spirits, that will mount to mischief. Let Suffolk lead. SUFFOLK. Pembroke's advice seems wise. Guilford approves. GUILFORD. I ride forth with my father To smite this false Bellona! JANE. Spare me, Dudley! My judgement is at fault. Northumberland, The council's will be our's: Go forth to conquer; If conquest, in this cause, indeed be just. NORTHUMBERLAND. Are your eyes stricken with judicial blindness? Or masks this show of zeal some dark intent That dares not face me forth? So be it. I go! But ye who stay, remember, Dudley's sword, Two-edged, can smite false friend or open foe. PEMBROKE. Point you at me, Lord Duke? NORTHUMBERLAND. I point at no man. O, my good Lord! let not the unaccused By self-excuses seem as self accusedâ Madam, at your command I go. [Aside] Hark, Guilford!â Watch Winchester: and if you find him false, Chain him up like a hound. For Pembrokeâmarkâ If you suspect himâif you but suspectâ Crush himâas I this beetle! [Aloud] Peers of England! As I comport myself, guard you the Queen. [Exit Northumberland attended. JANE. I would be private, for brief space; to pray Beside these loved remains. [All retire except Lord Guilford, the Duchess and Fakenham, who kneels, unobserved at the bier. JANE [kneeling]. Poor pomp of woe! ghastly magnificence! Beneath that veil what fearful sight lies hidden? I dare not pry into thy depths, O grave! For oh! those eyes, so sweet, severe, are glazed; Those lips that were so eloquently wise, That brain so stored before its time, that heart Pure as a fountain of celestial love. Cold are they nowâdead, dead! Pardon, dear Shade! The feeble form that dares enact thy greatness. Not mine that choice, O brother of my soul! No lust of power unsexed, nor idle gauds Betrayed my woman's heart: the public weal, Thy will, alone, compelled; dragging me hither, To pine, a pageant QueenâorâGod have mercy! Sink an abortive traitor to these vaults Whose every pavement is the monument Of public crime avenged. GUILFORD. You rave, my Jane! These shadows vex your brain. FAKENHAM. I charge you, stay! Daughter, I heard, rejoicingâin my heart Thy passionate pleading sank, sacred as thoughts Breathed in confessional. Hear in return The voice of God. The Heaven to which I point Attests my truth, and I adjure the dead; Laying my hand upon his coffined dust! Treasonâand ye have overstepped its vergeâ Treason, the Judas crime, that, in itself, Includes all other horrors that deform The angelic guise of Manâthis sin strikes home To Heaven itself: for Majesty divine His own imperial type vouchsafes to earth! Ay, Kings are by God's ordination fixed On pedestals so fenced with faith and worship, Compassed with sacramental oaths and incense, That to deface, obstruct, or counterfeit Is of the Church accursed, by human law Banned without pity, and avenged by God. Hear me, fair child! more sinned against than sinfulâ Time yet remains for penitence. JANE [flying to her Mother]. O shield me! Re-enter Northumberland attended. NORTHUMBERLAND. How's this? Pernicious Priest! we meet again. You prophesied these vaultsâforesaw the scaffold. FAKENHAM. The spirit that was then, is now upon me. The block is near, but which shall be the victim, Which witness I discern not. NORTHUMBERLAND. Juggler, Wizard! The flames shall purge that spiritâJane, your handâ Your's, GuilfordâI must speak one hurried word Ere treacherous tasks part us, perhaps for ever. This soft hand, Jane, unaided, is too weak To uphold the sceptre; and this polished brow To bear an unsupported diadem. 'Twere well the matrimonial throne were shared. Young though he be, my son's strong temperament, And subtletyâthat's his inheritanceâ Boldly shall shield it. You speak notâKneel, Guilford! Kneel to your Queen for safety: supplicate Your wife for thus much love. JANE. Strengthen me, God! Support my fond, weak nature. No, dear husband! This may not beâno royal blood is thineâ No subject can ascend the throneâthe Law Forbids it as a crime. GUILFORD. Love can do muchâ Straining, not wresting law. Fathers of kings Are not unworthy crowns they can transmit. JANE. Guilford! I love thee fondly: but this thing I dare notâwill not do. FAKENHAM. O noble creature! NORTHUMBERLAND. Dog, if thou barkest I will strike thee dead. FAKENHAM. Strike, if it be permitted thee: if not, The angel of the Lord can burst these walls, And free his servant, as he freed of old The apostle Peter! I defy thee! NORTHUMBERLAND. Marry! They spoiled in thee a marvellous good player, Making a monk. Remove him! Queen! farewell! Lack-wits are castaways betimes. GUILFORD. Farewell! JANE. Abandoned by my husband? God have pity! NORTHUMBERLAND. Guilford, remain; or all is lost. I join Your hands. Forgive her. All may yet go well. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHOIR. Woe, woe, unto the people! from our head The crown hath fallen; our laurel wreath lies dead! Our vine that yielded shade and fruit Hath perished from the root! ANTICHOIR. The Lord from out his temple spake in vain: Vainly his prophets threat, his priests complain! From wisdom all avert the ear; The froward will not hear! CHOIR. We preached God's wrath; and bade without delay, The carnal heart turn from his evil way. For surely God's avenging hand Smites every guilty land. ANTICHOIR. And He hath sternly smitten; as of old, When stout Josiah perished from the fold; And Jeremiah's deep lament With Israel's weeping blent. CHOIR. Woes have begun; our sorrows multiply; Our terrors and our penitential cry! For well we know we but begin To pluck the fruits of sin. ANTICHOIR. But oh! ye sorrow-laden! kneel in prayer That He, who once redeemed you, still may spare! The vials of thy wrath no more, Lord, on thy people pour!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. A Street in Cambridge. Enter Northumberland. NORTHUMBERLAND. I have plunged too deep. The current of the times Hath been ill-sounded. Frosty discontent Breathes chilly in the face of our attempt: And, like the dry leaves in November winds, These summer-suited friends fly my nipped branches. What's to be done? Time, like a ruthless hunter, Tramples my flying footsteps! banned and baited By my own pack, dogs fed from mine own hand Gnash fangs and snarl on me! Palmer! what ho! Enter Sir John Palmer. Thine eyes are downcastâheavy falls thy stepâ Sure token of bad tidings. PALMER. Ah! my Lord, Let me adviseâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Advise me no advice! Let me know facts. Will our men fightâor march? At least will they disband? You shake your head. PALMER. Indeed, my lord, the signs of disaffection Are manifold. Some stalk with sullen brow Musing apart: some gather in pale knots Whispering with sidelong glances: some stride boldly, Attesting men and saints that you betray them. In vain have I assayed all flatteries: At threats they laugh. NORTHUMBERLAND. Good Palmer, threaten not: Sooth ratherâWe must change our course, my friend. PALMER. Too late! NORTHUMBERLAND. What other hope remains? I thought To loose a tempest on the Tudor's head: But like a summer shower it melts away. Too bright the sunshine of true loyalty Flames in our eyes. The sword fails: we must kneel. PALMER. You should have weighed this ere you goaded us To this alternative. The lion's paw Is terrible to those who fly, or grovel. Are you not moved? NORTHUMBERLAND. I have been Fortune's mate, So long, my friend, I trust not in her smilesâ Fear not her frown. I tell thee, Fortune's wheel O'er the subjected world of men and things Shall yet roll onward, bearing Dudley's Fates. If time hold out, at worst one friend remainsâ Our Adversary's madness! That shall avail More than our best of wit. I know this Mary: But the world, knowing not, made her an Idol. She shall be known ere long. I bide my time. Here part weâsave thyself. [Exit Palmer. Now wit befriend me! These Malcontents!âstill will I march their leader, And be the first to hail her Queen. If spared, With jibe for jibe I meet short-witted knaves: He who would rise bends while the tempest raves. Scene II. Wanstead Heath. Enter Mary, Elizabeth, Arundel, &amp;c. ARUNDEL. Heaven smiles, my liege, upon the righteous cause. Welcome thus far upon your prosperous way. Here rest your wearied footâyour foes disperse Frail as the dust before their giddy feet. MARY. How name you this fair prospect? ARUNDEL. Wanstead Heath: By Epping chase. MARY. How blest these breezy downs, With purple heath and golden gorse enamelled; Each bosky bank with dewy windflowers strewn, Each dell with cowslip and rathe violetâ And the sun-loving daisy on hill tops Drinking the light! Ah, happy shepherd's life! He this sweet solitude, without constraint, Explores, his chosen damsel at his side: Recounting tales of love and plighted faith: Or from his pipe pours such delicious song That the wild hare in the close bitten lane Pauses with ear erect, and timorous deer That down the labyrinthine forest glade Goes bounding, starts aside, and turns to gaze. ELIZABETH. Old times returnâdiscourse for ever thus. MARY. Beneath this chesnut canopy, sun-proof, Cool as a cavern on the ocean shore, I'll take my rest. ELIZABETH. Not new to me this scene. Oft have I chased the red deer through these wilds, With our loved Edward. MARY. Saints be with him now! He loved you, Bess: not me the unbeloved! ELIZABETH. He loved you well till traitors edged between. God pardon him. MARY. And them! Preserve me, Lord, From the vindictive Fiend that tempts my spirit. ELIZABETH. Forswear sad thoughts. In fancy let us rove These downs and coverts. From yon breezy brow, Like a monk's head close-shaven, with boscage fringed, Oft have I watched Paul's steeple, o'er the smoke Of the great City glistering like a pyre. Along the horizon spread the billowy tops Of Hainault's forest oaks: nor far uprears The Fairlop tree his huge trunk, grey and bossy; A mighty shade, where village maids at eve In dance and song with rural archers sport. [A distant Trumpet sounds. ARUNDEL. The hart is near the toils. Thoughtless of fate, I hear his wanton belling on the wind. Enter Winchester and Pembroke. MARY. You are welcome. PEMBROKE. On our knees we sue for pardon: For that, long hampered in false Dudley's meshes, We stood aloof, in mock disloyalty. Praise be to God! the summer Sun hath risen To dry our tearful cheeks. God save the Queen! MARY. Well have I known your hearts were dutiful Albeit your outward carriage was unliegeful. Let worthy posts, Lord Marshal, be assigned them! [Great shouting heard. ARUNDEL. Fortune comes bounding on a flowing tide. MARY. What means this tumult? ARUNDEL. Dudley's ill-sorted Bands Have flung their arms aside; and hither rush, Frenzied with loyal zeal. Enter Northumberland with Soldiery in disorder. NORTHUMBERLAND. Hold back! this ardour Shall fright the Queen, not please her! Thus, my men! [Throwing up his cap. God save Queen Mary! MARY. Down with your sword! what mean you? Me thou can'st neither frighten nor cajole. Kneel, traitor, kneel! NORTHUMBERLAND. Lowly to earth abased, A penitent sincere, I crave your mercy! I might have lived an exile; but prefer To stoop my forfeit head and trust your pity. Too well my momentary treason (yea Treason it seems till you have read my soul) Deserves death. Yet considerately judge Confessed infirmity; remembering mercy, That best prerogative of Royalty! The common herdâ [Pauses. MARY. Nay, let your say be said. You have license, Sir; proceed. NORTHUMBERLAND. I cannot harm youâ But can well serve. For I have piloted The state so long that all its perilous leaks And privy treasons are to me revealed, And shall to your Grace if this poor life be spared. MARY. My Lord, I muse much at your strange appeal: And shall take counsel on it. NORTHUMBERLAND. Not with my foes! So were I crushed to screen their double treason. Your gracious nature knows not to delude. Trust your own wisdom. Give me hope! MARY. To live In righteous hope needs hope beyond this world. They only who serve God in his true Church Partake that blessing. Sir, you should have hope: But you have served, till now, whom hope disowns. I shall revolve your suit. My Lord, retire. Keep him in ward, not rigorous, but observant. [Exit Queen Mary, attended. NORTHUMBERLAND. My title she withholds not. That is well. And when she lectured of the hope men feel Who serve in the true Church, her eye had meaning, Beyond her words. True Church? there's food herein For cautious meditation. ARUNDEL. Please you, my Lord, We must proceed. Time presses. Forward, my men! [Exeunt. Scene III. The Great Hall of the Tower. Enter Jane with Guilford. JANE. Midnoonâyet silent as midnight! my heart Flutters and stopsâflutters and stops againâ As in the pauses of a thunder storm; Or a bird cowering during an eclipse. Alone, through these deserted halls we wander, Bereft of friends and hope. Speak to me, Guilford. GUILFORD. Thy heart-strings, Jane, strengthened by discipline, Endure the strain. JANE. Say rather, my Religion Hath taught this good. Nor lacks our female nature Courage to meet inevitable woe With a beloved one shared. GUILFORD. I cannot bear this! Is no one near? My throbbing brain will burst! Not one of all those courtling servitors Who thronged this hall but yesternight? Heaven's curse Palsy their servile soulsâsmirkers and cringers! Where are they now? Gone like foul fogs to choke The morn they hail. JANE. Such is men's deem of us. We have obscured a dawn! If spared, God grant We may make bright the Queen's triumphant way Like clouds that glorify the wake of noon. GUILFORD. Away this specious wisdom! it but goads me! Kiss me, sweet Jane! Soothe me with loving wordsâ Breathing warm fancies, nectared as thy breath! One passionate embrace may stifle thought. But this cool meekness stings me. [Embracing her. JANE [withdrawing hastily]. Ah, for pity! Is this a time? We should concentrate thought, Not dissipateâmake strong our hearts, not weaken. GUILFORD. What would you have? JANE. Be all a man should beâ A Christian man, a loyal gentleman! GUILFORD. And you? JANE. I am content to die with you. GUILFORD. Jane! I'm not worthy of you. JANE. Nay, dear Love, Say not soâthink not so. I am too boldâ Indeed I was too bold: and 'twas not wife-like So to repulse youâSee, my father comes. What news, my father? Enter Duke and Duchess of Suffolk. SUFFOLK. Dudley too falls from us. He was the first of all that craven crew In Epping Chase to cry âGod save Queen Mary!â Foul Traitor! JANE. O my Husband! I forgive him. And thouâresent not that my Father chafes. SUFFOLK. Daughter, the time is come when you must doff This regal style and ill-beseeming state: The ceremonials, now the exequies, Of your departed greatness. JANE. Sir, far better Brook I this order, than my forced advancement. Too dutiful a daughter, I forgot A subject's duty, when, at your behest, Reluctantly, yea sinfully, I wore them. Take back the crown. Even yet a prompt submission May quit my great offence. Go then, my Father, Seek out the Council. In our names renounce This treason. Plead, while the Queen's gracious heart Melts in this summer solstice of success. DUCHESS. Simple as wise, thy counsels now shall guide us. Haste we! the growing tumult in the street Heralds the Queen. SUFFOLK. Beloved Jane! pray for us. For thou alone art fit to call on God! [Exeunt Duke and Duchess. Enter Fakenham, who approaches Jane. FAKENHAM. Daughter, your hand!âExcuse a poor monk, Sir, Who not unused to royalty, makes bold To pity one who must lay down a crown: To reverence one whose virtues would have graced it: To comfort one who, having worn it wrongly, Bows her meek spirit to the chastisement. I take your hand: andâwhat I would not do In your prosperityâwith bended knee, Kiss humbly; paying to your spiritual brightness That homage which your grandeur could not win. JANE. Fakenham! true minister of Christ art thou! Fearless of danger in discharge of duty; And to the mourner prodigally kind. FAKENHAM. Perhaps I can be serviceably kind. I am your witness that your will was thrall To ever-blinding love; mistaken duty. You both are very youngâyou and your husband: And he so wrought on that his dazzled eyes Saw haloes and mock suns where'er they turned. I who have known the world, and knowing, spurned it, Who for myself would dare, for others invoke, The worst of temporal suffering if thereby Fruition might be won of joys immortal, I warn you, by no quibble seek to ward Right judgement. Plead your kindred: sue for mercyâ God give you light and grace! JANE. My conduct, Sir, Shall be to your advice conformable. FAKENHAM. The council freed me; rendering all the captives Unto my charge. Ah, precious were those souls That pined so long for the pure air of heaven! These have I called to meet the Queen: and thus Make Liberty the first fruits of her reign. Enter Exeter, Gardiner, Bonner, Tonstall, &amp;c. O worthy gentlemen! I greet you well! GARDINER. Thee first, O Lord! we bless for this great mercy! Through intercession of good saints vouchsafed! To thee too, blessed Virgin! we give thanks, For life, for liberty, for heaven restored; And holy Church thus justified in us! Good Fakenhamâchosen instrumentâreceive The Church's benediction! FAKENHAM. I am thankful. Thine this peace-offering, Lady! May the Queen Accept the precious gift with spirit appeased! JANE. O Guilford, hope! GUILFORD. It may not be: this man Deceives himself, or us; the very captives, Whom we had spared, pass us with looks averted. Jane, we must brave the worst! JANE. Endure it, Guilford! A salute of trumpets: acclamations: the castle gate is opened. Enter Queen Mary in warlike habiliments, with Elizabeth: preceded by a large golden cross. Also Arundel, Winchester, Pembroke, Suffolk, with his Duchess. Other Lords, Heralds, and Soldiers. MARY. Here plant the Crossâstaff of our pilgrimage! The pillared cloud at noon, and flame by night, That cheered my fainting heart, and made me fearless. [She kneels before the Cross. Type of our Faith! awful expositor Of mysteries unspeakable! thou leading, Have I not followed with untiring hope, Taintless fidelity? Have I not dared Dangers from open foes, from friends estranged, Hateful suspect even on my household floor, Perils of death, perils of mine own heartâ And in my brainâthreatening my very soul? Yet do I not for this, O Virgin Mother! Arrogate glory. Honour to thee! who hitherâ Even to my Father's hall, hast led me victor; Calm, though much moved; exulting yet not proud: By triumph undebased. [Rising]. Fakenhamâgood father! Servant of the Most High, in his name, hail! These are thy liberated captives? Well Hast thou performed thy dangerous offices. Bid them come near. O venerable Prelates! Scarce less than Martyrs, ye I first salute. Gardiner! uplift the cross once more in Winton. Tonstall! take back thy staff to Durham. Bonner! Be mitred chief of this proud city again. My Lord of Norfolk, with much joy I greet you; First of our English Barons. You, fair cousin Of Exeter, come hitherâHa! long years Of durance have not dimmed thy soft brown eyes, Nor streaked with silver thread thy chestnut curls. I marvel at thy freshness, gracious youth, Young as thou art; for prisoned years count double. Lead me, dear cousin, to my throne: now kneel. Rise up, Sir Edward Courtenaye, Knight of St. George! Fakenham, what wouldst thou say? FAKENHAM. Receive, my Liege, These captives from a hand, that, seeming guilty, Is yet most pure. From this unhappy Lady Accept this priceless boon. JANE. Pardon, sweet Cousin! Pardon, wronged Queen! Let my compunction wake Pity, yet slumbering in your woman's heart. You turn away!âthen God be my support! FAKENHAM. Beware! JANE. Ah Sir! too gently have you judged me. Usurper of the consecrated crown, The sacred sceptre, how can I be pure? Welcome Adversity, lifter up of veils! Before me, naked as a soul for judgement, Stands up my sin. 'Tis well! the worst is o'er! Suffer I must; but I will sin no longer! Can you forget?âdare you forgive? If not I bow, a penitent resigned. FAKENHAM. Great Queen! At this most hallowed moment shed not blood! Do I presume? MARY. Sir, you presume. Your station Is our confessional. There, as a daughter, I stand submissâyour Sovereign here. These nobles, These prelates are my lawful council. These I can rely on, and my proper self. Who dreamed I was athirst for blood? God's death! An if I wereâor if the general wealâ Or if the people's cryâor if the Church, Uttering the voice of Heaven, demanded,âwho Should stay my hand? FAKENHAM. Alas! I say no more. MARY. You have said too much. Competitors for thrones For ever lose the rights of privacy. If tools of faction, what avail their virtues? They represent opinion; are its leadersâ And must confront the peril they provoke; The penalty that gnaws the heart of treason; Promethean pangs which the roused Majesty Of Heaven inflicts on those who grasp its fires! FAKENHAM [aside.] The demon wakes within her heart: yet hope. I wait a milder moment. MARY. Duke of Suffolk! Your caseâand yours, madam, my cousin, differ From your bad daughter's. We commit to you Her custodyâbeware you break not trustâ But separate from her husband. JANE [kneeling]. Part us not! MARY. Separate from her husband; and confined Within these walls. What grace soe'er we yield To you, extends not to this guilty couple. They answer their offence. No more. Depart. [Exeunt Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, Lady Jane, and Lord Guilford Dudley. Your hand, my Sister. Exeter, take this Your Sovereign's hand; and this her fairer sister's. Lead forward: be henceforth our chamberlain. [Exeunt. Scene IV. A Street in London. Enter Bedingfield and Jerningham. JERNINGHAM. The Queen hath won her own: the kingdom peace. May both wax prosperous! but to that end Means must be found agreeable to Heaven. I do not think her Grace assured in health. What if she dieâdie childless? BEDINGFIELD. Heresy Will triumph with reaction terrible. Not Jane, nor yet Elizabeth will spare. JERNINGHAM. She should be urged to marry. BEDINGFIELD. Whom? JERNINGHAM. I know not. Some English gentlemanâsay Exeter, From prisoned boyhood grown to gracious manhood. BEDINGFIELD. Her father slew his father. Blood cements not Fabricks of love. Besides, captivity Hath left him scant of knowledge. JERNINGHAM. Comely he is, And stately in his presenceâgracefully bowsâ Talks nothings airilyâis affableâ He lacks not what shall please a woman's eye. BEDINGFIELD. A Queen who loves her people, seeks in wedlock, A counsellor to guide her troubled hours. Will Exeter be such? JERNINGHAM. There is a man, Whose royalty of soul outstrips his birthâ Whose youthful graces pleased her maiden fancy Long years agone; ere yet an honest frankness Drove him, a fugitive, from Henry's hateâ Reginald de la Pole. BEDINGFIELD. The Cardinal? Alas that one word clips the wings of hope! JERNINGHAM. No. The last vow, which bars him from the world, He hath not ta'en. Pole would adorn a crown. BEDINGFIELD. Religion fills his heart. No room for love! Courtenaye is near; and opportunity Feathers Love's arrow. She will take the wound. JERNINGHAM. Has ta'enâif I see rightly. Marked you not Her mienâher eyesâher smilesâher gracious wordsâ When first they met. BEDINGFIELD. Yesâhe will be her choice. JERNINGHAM. What if he choose not her? Have you not marked His eyes are on the Princess, while his tongue Waits on the Queen. BEDINGFIELD. Thou hast the trick of courts. The double dealer still sees double meanings. JERNINGHAM. May all end well! But much my mind misgives me. Equals in age, Time, as it flies, endears; But pairs ill-matched, dispart with parting years. Scene V. The Queen's Cabinet. Enter Mary, Arundel, Gardiner. MARY. These orders expedite. I shall preside At this great trial. ARUNDEL. Doth it please your Grace That all shall be arraigned to-dayâor each Called separately to plead? MARY. Each separately: But all confronted. Hark youâthere are rumours Of tumults in the city; gatherings Of sottish malcontents in hostelries; And fanatick preachments in the Queen's highway. Let the Queen's Sheriffs look to this. I brook No nightmare wondermentsâno babbling brooders Over small plots: wring off the heads of such. It is reported that Sir Thomas Wyatt In Suffolk speaks great things: admonish him: And that one Captain Brett his mouth enlarges, Among swash-bucklers, prentices, and gownsmen, Against our rights. Cut me this license short. I know this Brett; a dangerous man, who parleys With treason, and consorts with hereticks; A man without respect for forms or persons. Your office puts into your hand a sword To smite such evils. Let it be done. GARDINER. Dread Madam, The voice that I shall speak with to offenders, Pitched at your tone, shall make the guilty tremble! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. Great Hall of the Tower, as a Court. Enter Queen Mary, attended by Gardiner as Chancellor, Norfolk as High Steward, Arundel as Earl Marshal, Cranmer, Pembroke, Winchester, &amp;c. After these, Jane Grey and Lord Guilford Dudley, with Duke of Northumberland, as prisoners, preceded by the Headsman carrying the axe with its edge from them. Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, &amp;c. MARY [from the Throne.] Open the court! Norfolk, High Steward presiding. GARDINER. I stand before your Highness and your Barons Accuser of these Lords, and this sad Lady, Of treasons, so notoriously sustained By overt acts and speech we need not witness. But something I must say touching the root Of these offences. I have somewhere read That in the Indian isles there grows a tree Of goodliest aspect, spreading to the sun A canopy of shade so redolent Of odours, and attractive in that clime By its inviting coolness, that the unwary Are tempted to their ruin: for within The beauty of that bower lurks Death: the air Draws poison from its bloom, and all its shelters Die! in that tree behold this criminal! He in young Edward's court fatally flourished! Our nobles sat within his shade, and perished! Witness for me that princely Somerset, The King's own uncle, noblest of the land! What need to sum his wiles, rapacities? Ye exiles, and extinguished hearths, make answer! Sprung from a tainted stock, behold him leap, As at a bound, even to the height of all! From knighthood to a dukedomâfavouriteâ Sole minister of the inexperienced King:â Managing all, responsible for allâ (Ah there we touch you, Sir,âresponsible!) Alone in power, alone you must account. But why waste breath on petty crimes like these? To mount the throne for him were past all compass: But Sire of Kings he might be. Therefore he matched His son to Lady Jane, a royal maiden; Threatening the throne with dangerous approach. The King might die? the royal sisters fall By monstrous fictions of wrenched law o'erpowered! The King might die! Alas! the King did die! Died opportunely!âBut I abstain. Not now Is that foul deed in questionâ NORTHUMBERLAND. Foully you strike! Hinting my life away, branding my fame With rumours vile, and lying as the lips That utter them! NORFOLK. You must be silent, Sir, You shall be heard in your defence. GARDINER. That question May well be pretermitted: but the fact Is not, and cannot be, denied, he made Or sought to make his son's wife Queen of England. How he so practised on the dying King I show not forth. The matter, not the manner, Was the sufficient crime. Nor moot we here The royal right to alter the succession. Enough, the late King was deceived, enforced; And, in the very agony of death, Knew not his acts. My Lord of Canterbury! You, who were present, know that this is true. But why to you, or meaner personages, Refer? The Queen saw; and can testify. MARY. I witnessed at the death-bed of my brother Scenes of foul fraud and force; the prisoner present, A busy agentâhe will not deny it. GARDINER. My Lords! Religion was the plea for this. Religion, a wide cloak for godless knaves! What, knew they not the apostolick rule That men are bound to obey even sinful Princes? Who dares insinuate that our Queen's right rule Shall be a snare for conscience? Hypocrites! Why claim ye toleration, yet refuse it? Faith your perpetual cry, yet would ye stifle That Faith which is the trust of other hearts. Your Bible is your Idol: all must bow Before your exposition of its sense, Or forfeit allâthe very throne!âblind plotters! To shun pretended dangers ye have plunged Into assured destruction. Now, behold! Irrevocable crime stands up for judgment! My Lords, I claim your sentence! NORFOLK. Lady Jane, And you, Lord Guilford Dudley, are you guilty? JANE. Strengthen me Thou who helpest all in trouble! Flush my pale lips with truthâlet fear not sully My royal blood, fount of perpetual sorrow! I wake from the vain dream of a blind sleep, Nothing to hide, nothing extenuate. My Lords, reverse to me this good hath brought, That I who dimly saw, now plainly see, And seeing loathe my fault, and loathing, leave it. The bolts of heaven have split the aspiring tower Of my false grandeur; and through every rent The light of heaven streams in. Bear with me furtherâ I am ashamed to speak in such a presenceâ But there is oneâmy dear, dear husband,âspare him! One victim should suffice. My great offence Needs expiation: I am here to make it. My Lords, this day shall stand in English annals For ever memorized; establishing The law's dominion and the rightful rule. In time to come it shall be known, ambition Was not my nature though it makes my crime. I waste your leisureâpardon meâI've done. One grace alone I craveâin mercy weigh My husband's sore temptationâspare my husband! FAKENHAM [aside]. She rises from the sea of her great trouble, Like a pure infant glowing from the bath! GUILFORD. I too, my Lords, am guilty. Nought but youth, And sad misguidance, and connubial love Extenuate my guilt. I kneel for mercy! NORFOLK. Does my Lord Duke plead as his son hath pleaded? NORTHUMBERLAND. No! he hath pleaded as his fate constrains: Albeit my limbs thereby are doubly shackled. Madam! to you I turn. Trial by peers Cannot to me be just. Of those who judge How many are my noted foes! PEMBROKE. Not I! NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha! the vexed adder hisses! Well, my Lords! If this be treason (which if rightly construed By motives, as sure documents shall prove, Might bear a milder name) shall men sit there, There on that bench, once my accomplices? It was no treason at the King's command, To stablish the King's will by force of Law! If treason, then it was not mine alone, Who joined what all approvedâ PEMBROKE. You prompting them! NORTHUMBERLAND. Are you both judge and witness? Sacred honour! Can such things be? That act of council bears Its attestation in its signatures. Give me the instrument. What names are here? Some before mine. Here Thomas Cantuar;â Here Marquis Winchester, Lord Treasurer,â HereâworthyâPembroke; and his son Lord Herbert, The captain of the guard to Lady Jane. Why, my Lords, sit you there, if I stand here?â The reverend Prelate, labouring with dark tropes, Spake of a poison treeâpointing at me His sorry wit: if he implies by this That in my heart this plot had origin, I will not say he liesâmy poor condition, His office, bar that tauntâbut I say this, He wrongs me. Fanatick I have not been; Nor disputant: too little versed am I Even in the grammar of the science divine, To make theology rebellion's text, Or for my flag hang out a preacher's gown! Too much my youth, devoted to my Prince, And later life to labours of the State Have turned my thoughts from heaven. Now on life's verge With aching heart I stand, bound to clear up Doubts that have long oppressed me. I have done. Well know I that these judges will condemn meâ But thou, most pious Queen, pity my soul! NORFOLK. Barons of England you have heard. How say you? Are these who stand accused before you guilty? PEMBROKE. Guilty, upon my honour! ALL. Guilty, guilty! NORFOLK. What doth her Grace award? MARY. The Law saysâDeath! JANE. O mercy for my husband! MARY. Jane, my Peopleâ This realm of Englandâmust have peace. Alas! Too clearly I foresee peace and thy life Are inconsistent things. Nathless, thy doom Shall not be hurried. Time for theeâfor meâ Must be reserved. Let sentence be recorded. Against this hapless pairâno warrant written. Sir John of Dudley! titles, wealth, domains, Henceforth you forfeit: which may yet be shared Among your worthier sons. That conscience-stricken You do repent your spiritual misdeeds We much rejoice to learn. The dean of Paul's Our confessor shall yield you ghostly counsel. Break up the court! you are released, my Lords!â Come hither, Exeter! I would confer With thee some half hour henceâin privateâtake My hand. Adieu! till then. [Exeunt Mary, Elizabeth, Nobles and others. NORTHUMBERLAND [aside to Guilford.] Did you mark that? My Lords, if one yet mindful of old times Can heed a fallen man's prayer, I crave short audience: Lord Exeter, you are no foe, I thinkâ Will you vouchsafe brief speech? EXETER. I am your servant. NORTHUMBERLAND. Courtenayeâyou owe no wrong to meânay, rather, Friendshipâwell, call it service, if you will. Service I claim, and you can yield. Observe me: I hailed you once Plantagenet; you are so; Heir of the house of York: and what of that? I move you to no treasonâstart not, Sir! We are watchedâstand nearer. The Queen loves you, Courtenaye! Tut man! I know it. Hear me patiently. EXETER. You try my patience, I confess. NORTHUMBERLAND. So be it. Yet had I marvelled, if the man I spake to In presence of yon headsmanâyou remember?â Had checked me harshly. You, Plantagenet, Loved by the Queen (ay, marry, and the Princess) Must blend your pure blood with her doubtful strain. EXETER. Sir, this is idle. NORTHUMBERLAND. Not a whitâif you Spurn not kind fortune: trample not your friends. Your ear. The Queen, I grant you, is âno beauty Unless age makes one!ââThe Arragonian wears A diadem, what though she be âa whelp!â You mark?âor say you, take âchaste Boleyn's babeââ She suits you best, and you affect her mostâ But she is not the Queen. Take Mary Tudor! EXETER. My Lord! I see your drift. NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha! ha! you speak With due respect once more. Fair be the omen! EXETER. What can I do? NORTHUMBERLAND. When, ere an hour hath passed, You shall receive her troth-plight, think of me. Obtainâshe'll not deny it thenâmy pardon. Thenceforth am I your serviceable friend. Farewell! I wait her Grace's confessor. Ere I unload my grief 'twere wise to send me Good tidings. On your conduct I mould mine. EXETER. I'll hope the best for you. NORTHUMBERLAND. And to the best? EXETER. I'll do it. NORTHUMBERLAND. Princely Exeter! For this These halls shall echo yet thy Dudley's shoutâ God save King Edward of that name the seventh! [Exeunt severally, Exeter &amp;c. and the prisoners, preceded by the headsman, carrying his axe's edge towards them. Scene II. The Queen's Cabinet. Enter Mary alone. MARY. But that my day hath passed its matin prime, And timeless sorrow withered all my bloom, I should not yield my heart to these blank doubts. How shall a subject dare approach his Queen With love unbid?âI cannot live alone. This heart, so long beset with panther passions, Yearns for the trusty countenance of love. I cannot live alone. Our woman nature Doth need support, and loves the hand that guides it. O miserable Motherâdoomed to creep, With blasted heart, to a dishonoured grave! Terrible Father! Must I from each inherit Your separate Nemesisâpredestined woes? And dare I dream of love? never for me Shall that sweet bud unfold its perfect flower. I have lovedâit is pastâO Reginald! Thou art avenged, my early love, my only! Yet why, why take the irrevocable vow? Fruitless repinings hence! In such a mood I must not meet this youth. Forgotten blush! Dost thou come back? let me consult thee, mirror. Plain-spoken Monitor! what dost thou teach? That eye alone retains its glance of power; Dark as a caverned well, profound, pelucid; Quick to flash back all gleams of angry light, Or softer radiance. But where hast thou fled, Bloom of young healthâlife's vernal tide, that like The sap, developes the sweet wealth of flowers? Those knitted browsâthat forehead scored with linesâ Those lips compressed and sternâthose pallid cheeksâ AyâTime, and blighting Care have done their work! I'll look no more! what if he loathâreject me! Orâfearful thought!âaccept and hate? or stoop In meretricious spirit to caress The hand that gives a sceptre? [She covers her eyes with her hands. After a pause enter Exeter, who kneels beside her. EXETER. Queen! sweet mistress! Your too presumptuous cousin dares approach This fair hand with a kiss. Hope, like the lark, Warbles too high for ears on earth to hear it. MARY. Too quickly, palled with courtly blandishments, Doth Royalty to dangerous power admit False favourites. What, Courtenaye, wouldst thou be? EXETER. Your true Knight: sworn to reverential love! MARY. You talk of love! Well know I that true love Visits not thrones. The lonely sitter there Finds flatterers, lip-worshippers, but not True love: true love must be baptized in tears; Must bow, and weep before the chastener Time; And grow by self-abasement purified. Being a Queen, I tremble at this loveâ Being a woman, tremble to refuse it. EXETER. Accept it, noblest lady! wanting love, We miss all hope of the chief blessedness Of life; all nuptial comforts; joys of offspring; The ornaments of youth, and props of age. Choose thenâbut worthily. MARY. Oh Edward, Edward! I know thy wishâ [Pauses. EXETER. Speak on, sweet Saint, speak on! MARY. At least what thou would'st have me think thy wishâ EXETER. Can you suspect? MARY. Suspicion comes of sorrow. Pain, wrong, oppression breed distrustful thoughts. I cast them from me! Can I have read in vain The language of thine eyes, thy lips, thy heart? Long since, and oft, thy prisoned sighs have reached meâ But then we met not. Were such sighs sincere? EXETER. Thy matchless constancyâthy fearless truth, Won love from all. MARY. From all? I wished but one! EXETER. Since we have met have not plain words been spoken? Have I dissembled? MARY. Then were I wronged indeed! EXETER. O Mary, doubt no more! MARY. Then, take me, Edward! To trifle were unworthy of a Queenâ Unworthier of a woman. Take me, Edward! I will be thine. I choose thee from the noblest, A fitting mate for England. Princely blood, Tempered by nurture, purified by sorrow, Should be the Nation's safeguard. Take me, Edward! [She drops her head on his shoulder. Let me look on thy faceâGod bless thee, Youth! A sad heart thou hast touched with new-born joy; And lured back self-esteem, so long estranged. Now part we for a space: yet ere thou goest, Ask'st thou no boon? I yearn to make thee happy! Some favour I shall find a grace in givingâ Thou, honour in receiving. EXETER. There is a manâ He served meâtherefore, loathing him as I do, I would serve him, though guilty, in return. MARY. What guilt would I not pardon at thy suit? EXETER. Then grant me Dudley's pardon. MARY. Dudley's pardon? Well, be it so! His doom shall be remitted. No more of him? This hand is yoursânow lead me To my sister's chamber. She must share our joy. [Exeunt together. Scene III. An Apartment in the Tower. Enter Mary and Exeter. MARY. Not here? then we must seek her in the pleasance. Go thouâour Chancellor claims audience first. Go seek my sisterâtell her what thou wilt. I follow, and shall ratify the tale. EXETER. Delay not, gentle mistress. Slowly creeps The sand of Time when watched by love-sick eyes! MARY. Send Gardinerâso adieuâadieu! [Exit Exeter. How noble His aspect! and how full of grace his port! I shall be happy yet!âNot here we'll dwell, Within these doleful turrets. Windsor's shade Suits happy lovers. There we'll stray together Unseen, but by the wild deer's timid eyeâ I shall be happy yet! This fluttering heart Shall ache no more with fearful expectation. No cares but wife-like cares shall cloud my browâ As thusâwhy lingers his wind-footed steed So long upon the chase? How in the tourney Fares his unshivered lance; his spotless plume? Wherefore his appetite is dullâcheek paleâ His spirit chafed? Or, peradventure, all That throng of sweet solicitudes that stir Maternal bosoms for their infant charge. Why woeful tears from ready laughter startâ And what caress can soothe such fragile hearts. Sweet cares! delicious dreams!âBut I awake! Enter Gardiner. Gardiner, I greet you well! My heart is light! Why look you graveâyou bring no heavy news? GARDINER. The christian mourns when but a sinner dies. I bear the warrant for a sinner's death: Dudley's. Wil't please you sign? MARY. I have changed my purpose. Prepare a pardon: traitor though he be. GARDINER. Pardon, my liege? Have you considered this? MARY. My Lord of Exeter hath shown good causeâ You smileâ GARDINER. I had forboded this. My Lord Is light of thought, and, so he gains his end, Weighs not the issue. MARY. Edward Courtenaye, Sir, Deserves not censure. GARDINER. Dudley visited Lord Exeter in prison. MARY. We know well He served him: therefore Courtenaye serves him now. GARDINER. After the trial they had private converse: And a quick ear caught wordsâtouching the Princessâ MARY. My sister? GARDINER. Yesâhis love for herâso said, Or seemed to say, this Dudley. MARY. Seemed to say? There's some mistakeâI tell thee, it is false! Give me a chairâ GARDINER. You are very pale, my liegeâ MARY. Sir, I am well. It is a lie, I say! As you shall learn. Report our grace to Dudley: Then join us in the gardens. There you'll find Our sister, and much cherished Exeter; Whom thou, Lord Chancellor, must learn to honour, Not to malign. GARDINER. Pardon my heedlessness. It was a fault. I shall be circumspect. MARY. Be so and prosper. Join us presently. [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. The Tower Gardens. Enter Elizabeth from an Arbour, hurriedly: followed by Exeter. He kneels. ELIZABETH. Miscreant! how have you dared to speak such language To a daughter of England? EXETER. Mercifully judge me. ELIZABETH. This is no case for mercy, but avengement. Dare you to trifle thus with royal hearts? You proffered love forsooth! ventured caresses! But, Sir, I checked you, as was your desertâ And spurn and trample on you as a scorpion. Begone, I say, once more! Enter from behind Mary with Gardiner unobserved. EXETER. Will you not pardon A victim, not offender? ELIZABETH. Not offender? What, wed a Queenâand privily woo her sister? Out on thee! hence! I spit upon thee, caitiff! EXETER. I had no choiceâstrangely she wrought on me. You know herâin her passions terribleâ Dared I repulse her? Madness held us both. I loving theeâthee only, pledged my trothâ Yea, pledged my troth, and must beâ ELIZABETH. King of England! EXETER. Have you no heart for pardon? ELIZABETH. None for thee! Elizabeth of England never pardons. A heart like hers, above the common shafts Of hope or fear, indifferently regards Unworthy suitors: treats them as light toys, To be cast aside, contemptuously forgotten. EXETER. Have you a heart? ELIZABETH. No heart, Sir, to betray me: No heart forgetful of my dignity: No heart the slave of sensuous weaknesses: No heart that blinds to duty! EXETER. Precious time Is passingâpromise me one boon, at leastâ If not forgiveness, silence. She whom I loatheâ Whom I must wedâwill soon be hereâ MARY [staggering forward]. Is here!â O God! O God! ELIZABETH. What have you heard? whate'er I said, I am prepared to reavow. No plotter Iâno spier out of plots! MARY. O God! O God! ELIZABETH. I spake in hasteâforgive me! My poor, poor sister! only be calm and hear me. Nay, pluck not at your throatâstare not so wildly! Will no one fetch some water? she will choke. MARY. What's this? where am I? the earth reelsâthe wind Howls through my earsâyour hand, Sir, or I fall! Elizabeth! you weepâsomething has happenedâ What? what? Has any one assailed my life? My brain is wounded. GARDINER [aside]. We must change her thoughtsâ Or she will straight go mad. I bring, my liege, False Dudley's pardon. MARY. Ha!âa pardonâDudleyâ Yes, I remember. Give itâquickly, quicklyâ Give itâThus, thus, like my poor heart, I rend thee! I crush thee! Thou shalt dieâO pandering Fiend! There was another paperâgive it to meâ Warrant of doom!âa penâthereâlet him dieâ [Signs the warrant. Stabber of hearts!âere sunset. Hear ye? vengeance! A vulture gnaws my heartâfood, food, for vengeance! Soft: there was yet anotherâwhere is he? And she, my loving sisterâBoleyn's child!â Seize on the false ones! GARDINER. She is innocent. ELIZABETH. My Lord, I pray you, peace. MARY. Who dares oppose me? Obey me, Sirâorâorâobstruct me notâ Or I will do such deeds as shall make pale The Angel of the Record! Ha! still hereâ Thou wretched, wretched man? yet, let me look One moment on the face I loved. [She catches Exeter's arm, gazes wistfully in his face, then suddenly kisses his forehead. The lastâ Passion's last weakness! I am weak no more! Henceforth I root all softness from my heart. Away with himâwith her! [Exeunt Elizabeth and Exeter, severally, in custody. Enter Page, bearing a cup. What's this? some wine? Ayâlet me tasteâI need itâI am faint. [She lifts the cup. I take this as a sacramental pledge! Henceforth am I a dedicated creature To my country; to my God! I rend all weakness Forth from my bleeding heart. Nor kin, nor love Shall warp me. If I live, I'll rule this land For pious ends severe, not happinessâ For dutyâfor my People, for the Church! [She drinks, making the sign of the Cross. The Church for England! England for the Church! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. A Prison Chamber, Tower. Northumberland at a table: Jane and Lord Guilford Dudley seated near. NORTHUMBERLAND. My soul is cheerful! fill the goblet high! And I will pledge thy fortunes, daughter Jane! In faith I'm joyous. Speak, my dainty Jane! Your husband is beside you, and I live. Ay, and shall liveâarch plannerâto rebuild Our tottering fortunes. Fair philosopher! Let me hear once again thy low, grave voice Disposedly conversing. Laugh, my Son! Waken these walls with jubilant acclaims! Still silent? does my mirth confound you? Jane, I tell thee thou shalt queen it yet. Thy babe Shall wear a crown. JANE. No crown but martyrdom's Will fit our brows. Indeed you are to blame, Sir. This morningânay, but one short hour agoneâ You waited certain death. Believe me, Sir. We all stand on the very brink of doom. NORTHUMBERLAND. So saith the preacher to the healthiest man: And yet the man lives on. Tush! you are blind. Do I not know my tool? this Exeter? And what enamoured Queens will yield to lovers? My head, be sure, was safe an hour ago: And now this scrawl secures me beyond fate. JANE. Direct him, God! to profitable thoughts For this great mercy! NORTHUMBERLAND. Rather let me learn To improve good fortune. When the crown is thineâ JANE. The crown for meâfor mine?ânever, Sir, never! Too heavy lies one sin upon my soul! I seek notânever soughtâwill wear no crown! NORTHUMBERLAND. Not seek it? Wellâ'Twill come unsought, I ween. GUILFORD. This morning, Father, you had messengers From Wyatt. Said they well? NORTHUMBERLAND. All doubts removed: All scruples satisfiedâhe's ours, our's only! GUILFORD. But how escape these wallsâhow join his power? JANE. O talk not of escape. We are spared: be thankful! Abjureâwhat I ne'er feltâthis false ambition: Unprofitableâthat I will not urgeâ But most unholy: do not heed your father. NORTHUMBERLAND. But he shall heed me; and thou too, despite Thy yea and nay. JANE. Have you no gratitude? The Queen, no matter why, remits your doom. NORTHUMBERLAND. And am I not beholden to her Grace? Good Mary Tudorâbeauteous Mary Tudorâ Wise Mary Tudor! I shall not forget. The time is comingâHa! my confessor! Enter Fakenham. And trusty counsellor! why look you grave? I'm in a merry mood. Bring you the warrant Her Grace vouchsafed? FAKENHAM. I bring a warrant, Sir. JANE. See, seeâhis face is sadâhis eyes are downcast. His words equivocalânot thus, not thus, Good tidings travel. NORTHUMBERLAND. What, man, know you not The Queen's late change? you have been kinder to me Than I had looked for, or deserved. Your step Is heavy, and your countenance distraught. I pray you, speak. FAKENHAM. Alas! unwillingly I witnessed the Queen's change: her lastâher saddest. NORTHUMBERLAND. Her lastâwhat dost thou mean? Is the Queen dead? Saddestâwhy then should Exeter be joyous? Look not so grave, fair Jane! fear nothing, Jane! Why speak you not? your mystery disturbs These fearful captives. What saith Exeter? How thrives he with the Queen? FAKENHAM. Let thoughts more serious Subdue your spirit, Sir. When last we spake Of sin and sorrow, and repentant hope, It seemed your heart was touched, hard reason shamed. Such my hope thenâsuch now your only hope. NORTHUMBERLAND. Dark Sayer! does this answer meet my question? What of the Queen? of Exeter? FAKENHAM. The Queenâ Body and soul are stricken to the earth. The Princess and that minion Exeter Shut up in prisonâwherefore you will guess. NORTHUMBERLAND. I'm lost, I'm lost! trapped in my own wild snare. FAKENHAM. Madam, may it please you to retire: the time Is short. NORTHUMBERLAND. What timeâmy time? Give me that paper. What's this? Death! Death! sudden, unnatural death! I'm blind! by heaven and hell I cannot die. I am not fit to dieâI dare not die! O hypocrite! this work is thineâthou hat'st meâ As I have hated theeâI'll not deny itâ Thou hast done this! FAKENHAM. You wrong me. I would fain Have saved thy life. Have I not saved thy soul? NORTHUMBERLAND. O pardon my distracted bearing, Sir! You reasoned eloquentlyâwhispered mercyâ FAKENHAM. God is a God of mercy. NORTHUMBERLAND. Torturer! Dost thou equivocate with pangs like mine? Thou palterest still: yet canst thou save me, Priest. Think of my soul! I cannot, unabsolved, Pass to the presence of my Judge. Hark! hark! [A sound of hammering is heard. What noise is that? you hear it? FAKENHAM. This, indeed, Would try the stoutest heart. NORTHUMBERLAND. The scaffold-workers!â I'm coldâOh very cold! Give me some wineâ Go, Jane! I shame that you should see me thus. FAKENHAM. Christian! be calm! yet all would stagger thus, If anchored not by certain hope in heaven. NORTHUMBERLAND. Fakenham! your tongue is gifted to persuadeâ Save me!âI will beâwhatsoe'er you wish. FAKENHAM. Can you speak thus upon the scaffold? NORTHUMBERLAND. Ayâ Much more!âYou museâIs there yet hope? even then? O say! I'll speakâI'll doâI know not what! Anythingâall you wishâspare but my life! This is too sudden. I'm not fit to die!â O for a death blow in the front of battle! The shout of victory, or kinsmen's wail, Above my dying head! It is not pangs, Nor death itself, but this reverse that shakes me. Despise me not, sweet Jane! can you not speak One word of comfort to a dying father? FAKENHAM. Horror hath almost choked her. Take her hence: This is no scene for women. [Guilford leads Jane away. NORTHUMBERLAND. Is there hope, Even on the scaffold, if I make profession Of the true Faith? FAKENHAM. I know not. But make clean Your heart by penitence. Prepare for death: So shall your future life, if life be spared, Prove worthier than the past. I seek the Queen. Put trust in God alone; and He will spare. [Exeunt severally. Scene II. The Tower Hill. A Scaffold at the end of the stage. A side porch through which enter Northumberland, guarded, preceded by Bedingfield, as Lieutenant of the Tower; Pembroke; and others. NORTHUMBERLAND. Something, ere yet I die, touching my faith I would make known. It is a privilege Precious to all, but specially to meâ Am I permitted? BEDINGFIELD. Without doubt. PEMBROKE. Your Lordship Will bear in mind, Sir Henry is enjoined To have this matter perfected ere sunset. The horizon's clouded: not to miss true time, He should be prompt. NORTHUMBERLAND. Why then abridge my time By this unseemly let? this gentleman Stands in commission: you but a spectator; Cruel, unmanly, and unnatural! PEMBROKE. False to the last! NORTHUMBERLAND. Protect me from this dastard, Who strikes me chained! I was a pardoned man An hour agone. This sudden change might scare The stoutest heart, the most obdurate soften. Let me not mount, with angry passions chafed, Yon fatal stage: but with an humble spirit Forgiving, seek forgiveness from my God. PEMBROKE. Think you all honest men are silenced here, While knaves speak free? NORTHUMBERLAND. Aspick avaunt! BEDINGFIELD. Be silent, My Lord of Pembroke: this is harsh. Sir John, Speak as you purposed. NORTHUMBERLAND. I must crave short pause Till the dean of Paul's return. I would pour forth My last prayers at his knees, my spiritual sponsor. Rightly you hear. This holy man hath shown My soul's dark errors: which I purpose here, By free confession somewhat to atone. PEMBROKE [Aside]. By Heaven he will recant, and win his pardon With neck upon the block! NORTHUMBERLAND. Hear me, good people! I do acknowledge my most grievous sin. Out of all bounds ambitious, I deserve This doom. Be warned by me. Hold fast that Faith Which your forefathers loved; consenting not To heresy, foul source of shame and sin! There grew my bane. I temporized with evilâ Basely partook with those false fanaticks Who daily trumpet forth spurious reformâ And, spite of the keen pricking of my conscience, Presumptuously stroveâ'tis goneâ'tis goneâ PEMBROKE. Ha, ha! NORTHUMBERLAND. That laugh was imped in hell! Strike, Fiend! Here at the breast that loathes, the mouth that bans thee! Cowardly stabber, strike! give me some pang Shall counterwork this torture of the mind! Look at him! see that man I made a man Shrink from Scorn's phantom finger like a houndâ What! not a look? then, thus, thou smitten hound! [Touching Pembroke with his finger who starts back and retires. Merciful Heaven! is this a mood to die in? O child! O babbling maniac! fool, fool, fool!â BEDINGFIELD. Keep out my Lord of Pembroke. NORTHUMBERLAND. I am thankful. Good people, pray for me! Enter Fakenham. Fakenham, am I saved? FAKENHAM. God grant salvation to thy sinful soul! NORTHUMBERLAND. The terrible âTo beâ is come! Time's past! Yet all's to doâan age crammed to a span! Time, never garnered till thy last sands ebb,â How shall my sharp need eke thy wasted glass, Or wit reverse it? my brain spinsâmy tongue Is palsied. I must have timeâI must have time! Hurl me not like a dog into the pit! FAKENHAM. Turn thee to God! forget this world! NORTHUMBERLAND. O Thou Great Being! who hast made me what I am, Crush not for ever this sin-leavened clay! Forget not mercy. Thou, not Judge alone, But just Redeemer! save me in my sin!â My voice is chokedâTime racks meâWorld, farewell! [Northumberland drops on his knees before Fakenham, bowing his head upon his hands; then starts up, and hurriedly ascends the scaffold. NORTHUMBERLAND. The block! the vault! thus are thy words fulfilled! BEDINGFIELD. Follow, my Lords; bear witness to the end. And you, Sir, recollect, as the head falls, Give fire to your great ordnance: that the Queen May know, thereby, the traitor is no more. [The scene closes: and, after a pause, a Cannon shot is heard. Scene III. The Council Chamber, Tower. Enter Fakenham in much agitation, followed immediately by Gardiner. FAKENHAM. 'Tis past! Thank God! the habitude to face All ordinary pangs steeled me not here. Terrible Conscience with unswerving eye Glared on him: and the bright edge of the axe Was as a fascination. Never before Had I beheld a soldier famed for prowessâ A statesman ever feared for daring counselâ So abject in reverse. He could not speak: Scarce seemed to hear; and when upon the block He laid his neck, his arms fell stiff and frozen: And there he layâlips blanched, eyes shut, cheeks ghastly; Insensible as when, a moment after, The severed head was held aloft blood-streaming. Pray God to spare me such another sight! GARDINER. I marvel not, friend Fakenham, thou wert shaken. But awful times are coming; when our eyes Shall be familiarized with woe. Time comes When the Church shall awake, and strike; inflicting Pangs that shall purify the sinful flesh, And save from everlasting flames the soul. Look youâthe very sorrows of the Queen Make her the fitting instrument. Mourn not Because the cleansing tempest in its path Meets and strikes down some tree of goodly fruitage. FAKENHAM. Alas! for poor Jane Grey! GARDINER. I grieve for her. But in her sure fate see preventive mercy: The infected air hath need of hurricanes. Jane living, last hope of these hereticksâ Sure pillar of their causeâgraced as she is With bodily perfections sweet as spring, And mental ripeness plentiful as harvest, Throws into shade our sad, though saint-like Queen. Both cannot live. One sun lights many spheres: But two suns for one sphere, nature prohibits. FAKENHAM. My Lord, I see too well it must be so. Jane Grey must die! GARDINER. And quickly. Linked events Envelope, drag her down. Sibylline lips Have opened; and a warning hath gone forth! Her creedâor oursâmust perish! Have we wisdom, And speed we not the march of prophecy? But hush! she comesâsad Mary Tudor comesâ Cold, but composed, marmoreally rigid! I have thought in vain, unprofitably read, If such a mien as that portend not fate. Enter Queen Mary attended. MARY. My Lord, we waited. GARDINER. Zeal for your Grace's service Be our excuse. MARY [to Fakenham]. You saw the traitor's end. Died he a Catholick? FAKENHAM. His last professions Bespoke true Faith. God, only, knows the heart. I hope he died in Faith. MARY. Such is my prayer. The strong hand then of treason is cut off. You hear, my Lords, that Wyatt, yesternight, Hath countermarched, and crossed the Thames at Hampton? He, and that lozel Brett, confederate, fill Our streets with outrage. Scouts from these have held Close conferences with Lord Guilford Dudley; Whom, lying under sentence, we had spared. Shall we still spare? GARDINER. So were your Grace imperilled: With you the Church; with both the Common-weal. MARY. Then let his sentence be fulfilled to-morrow. GARDINER. His wife? MARY. I will consider. GARDINER. She is proclaimed From street to street: the very walls are ciphered With traitorous scrolls, that hail her âJane the Queen.â Shall such wrong go unchecked? MARY. That is their folly; Not hers. The culpable shall smart for this. Enter Bedingfield hastily. Pardon my liege! it is no fault of mineâ As shall be provedâthe duke of Suffolk's fled; And joined with Wyatt. MARY. Suffolk fled? Jane's father? Henceforth let justice rule. Farewell, weak Pity! We cannot, Jane, both live: why then, die thou! [She takes a parchment from a cabinet and signs. 'Tis done! the royal rebel must abide Her doom to-morrow. First, let the husband die. FAKENHAM. Hear me! MARY. Beware, Sir! FAKENHAM. I but supplicate Permission to approach this hapless lady. A holier spirit may perchance awake; Worthy the sweet prerogative of mercy. MARY. If Jane abjures her heresy, I spare her. So will she be no longer to the Church A foul reproach, a canker in the State. No more. Break up the council. Gardiner! Be it again so ordered, at the moment Lord Guilford dies a cannon be discharged. Then lead to execution Lady Jane. [Exeunt severally. Scene IV. A Prison in the Tower. Lady Jane, alone, sewing a shroud. She turns an hour glass. JANE. I never more shall turn that glass. For me Time is fulfilled: and ere those sands run down, My trembling fingers must complete their taskâ Their final taskâor not in work of mine Shall his dear limbs, composed in death, be wrapped. With what a speed they haste! by mine own heart I count the flying seconds of his life. Oh what a task for wedded hands!â'Tis done! And now I fold and lay thee to my bosom, Which his espoused head so loved to press. Enter the Duchess of Suffolk. What noise is that? not timeâit is not time? Oh my dear Mother. [Falls on her neck. DUCHESS. Wretchedâwretched Mother! JANE. It is not much to die. Whoever faints Has tasted death, waking in pain to sorrow. Have comfortâDesolate I leave you not: My father near and other duteous daughters. DUCHESS. Thy father hath gone forth and raised his banner To dare the Queen. This act hath sealed thy doom. The father slays his child! JANE. God's will be done! How dark soe'er his ways or blind our eyes! My precious mother! weep notâleave me some strength! DUCHESS. Would I were dead! JANE. Live for my sister's sake. She needs thy counsel, and my sad example: For there is that in Herbert's father's heart, May move him to attempt the crown for her. DUCHESS. O let her rather labour in the fields, And spin for bread beside a cottage hearth, Than step unto a throne! Thou fatal Blood! Predestinated race! all who partake Thy veins must pour them forth on battle fields, Or the foul scaffold! Doomed Plantagenet! The Tudor follows in your steps. JANE. Our sands Have almost run. I must be quick. Will he See me once more? one last, last kiss bestow? DUCHESS. The malice of the Queen forbids. JANE. Say mercyâ Else were our hearts left beggared of all firmness. 'Tis best thus. We shall meetâyes, ere yon sun, Now high in heaven, shall from the zenith stoop, Together they will lay us in one coffin, Together our poor heads. Weep not, my mother! But hear me. Promise you will see this done. DUCHESS. I promise. JANE. So our bones shall intermingle; And rise together, when the angelick trump Shall lift us to the footstool of our Judge! What shall I give thee?âthey have left me littleâ What slight memorial through soft tears to gaze on? This bridal ringâthe symbol of past joy? I cannot part with it: upon this finger It must go down into the grave. Perchance After long years some curious hand may find it, Bright like our better hopes, amid the dust, And, piously, with a low sigh, replace it. Hereâtake this veil, and wear it for my sake. And take this winding sheet to him; and this Small handkerchief so wetted with my tears, To wipe the death-damp from his brow. This kissâ And thisâmy lastâprint on his lips, and bid him Think of me to the last and wait my spirit. Farewell, my Mother! farewell, dear, dear, Mother! These terrible moments I must pass in prayerâ For the dyingâfor the dead! farewell! farewell! [Exeunt severally. Scene V. The Queen's Cabinet in the Tower. Queen Mary alone. MARY. I have no thirst for blood; nor yet would shrink From shortening earthly life: for what is life That we should court its stay? a pearl of price In festal daysâbut mockery to mourners. What's life to theeâthy loved one deadâpoor Jane? What's life to me, by him I loved betrayed? I take from thee what is no loss to thee; And much infects the realm. Gladly would I My life on such conditions sacrifice. The time for thy short widowhood is come: But ye shall reunite above. For me The heart's blank widowhood must be for ever. Jane! on thy block the throned Queen envies thee! âI am not well: my brain is hot: around me Are flitting shapes unearthly. Sleep forgets me: And waking visions mock me, worse than dreams. âWho knocks? Enter Gardiner and Fakenham. What would you, Sirs? we would be private. Speak, quickly, quicklyâI am chafed and stung With troublous thought! GARDINER [aside]. 'Tis as I feared. Her eye Is restless; and the red spot on her cheek Looks angry. [Aloud] Captain Brett is ta'en, my liege, And Wyatt. MARY. Whom impeach they? are they questioned? Do they confess? GARDINER. Not yet: they had not time. MARY. See they confess: else, stretch them on the rack! This heart is rackedâmy guiltless heartâwhy not The limbs that trample down all covenants Of God and man? Ayâtorture, till confession! I who see visionsâhark you!âknow what you Who wake are blind to. Treason lurks beneath The blandest smile; the most obsequious bow. Trust none! the comeliest and fair-spoken least. Doubt most who most profess! O have a care Of youths and maids that in their girdles hide Dagger and poison!âwhat a man was Dudley! To tremble at the axe! why, I should laughâ Iâa weak woman! but there's cause for thatâ Hush! you shall hear anon. Then Exeter? But, we'll not talk of himâpoor fool!âI want To see Jane Greyâafter her widowhood. FAKENHAM [aside]. After?âshe then shall live. GARDINER [aside]. Observe, she raves. MARY. We'll sit together in some forest nook, Or sunless cavern by the moaning sea, And talk of sorrow and vicissitudes Of hapless love; and luckless constancy; And hearts that death or treachery divides! What's the hour? be quickâbe quickâI've much to do. GARDINER. Just noon. MARY. There will be death soon on the air, With outspread pinions making an eclipse. Ha! ha! brave work we Queens do! destiny Is in our hands: yea, in these very veins The spirit of the fatal Sisterhood Riots! the snakes of the Eumenides Brandish their horrent tresses round my head! FAKENHAM [aside]. This must be met. It hath been said that music, Some simple strain breathed forth by human voices, Can counterwork the venom of sick minds. If the choked fountain of her tears he cleansed, All shall end well. GARDINER. Throw wide the gallery doors, That open on the chapel. It is the hour For serviceâhark, the prelude hath begun. And now the Choir. [Fakenham throws open the folding doors of a Gallery, through which issue solemn strains of Musick. As the Musick proceeds the Queen's stupor relaxes, and her sensibility gradually revives. The Musick ceases. MARY. Airs fresh from heaven breathe round me! Sing on, bright angels! tears relieve my heartâ My brain is calmed. Sing on and let me weep! [A pause. Would they were saved! Alas poor widowed one! Can it not still be done? no, noâtoo late! [A death bell begins to toll. It is the hour: there is no time for thoughtâ She will be widowed while I speakâ [She speaks hurriedly and with much agitation. Seeâseeâ The dark procession issues from the gateâ And now they tread the courtsânow Guilford mounts The scaffoldânow the headsman kneels for pardonâ Now bares the comely throatâand now clasped hands Rise from the blockâwhile holy lips pronounce Slow absolutionânow he stoops his headâ And nowâand nowâ [After a short pause the signal gun is heard. He is no more!âGreat God! Have mercy upon both! GARDINER. Her thoughts are changed: Her brain relieved. FAKENHAM. Now plead for Jane. GARDINER. Too late! Hear yonder bell. MARY. What's that? again the death bell! Hark you! I would have speech with Jane. Fly, Fakenham! My foot is weak and slowâGardiner, attend me. Fly, Fakenham, fly! FAKENHAM. Too late! too late! too late! [Exeunt. Scene VI. The inner Court of the Tower. A Scaffold at the rear of the scene. Enter Jane Grey leaning on the Duchess of Suffolk, followed by Bedingfield, &amp;c. JANE. My Mother! we part here. DUCHESS. Tear her not from me! Was it for this, O martyred saint, I bore thee? Is my long travail's fruit thy bloody death? JANE. Here must we part. She faintsâso best for both! Gently remove her. Bless thee! bless thee, Mother! And give thee length of years, to me deniedâ Now lead me forward: I am ready. BEDINGFIELD. Madam, We fain would linger on the way. Our eyes, Blind though they be with tears, strain round to catch Some signal of reprieve. JANE. O seek it not! It cannot be. My life may not consist With the realm's safety. Innocent am I In purpose; but the object of great crimes. Good blood must still flow on till Jane's be shed. BEDINGFIELD. At least we may delay till the Dean comes To whisper spiritual comfort? JANE. Infinite Is the Almighty's goodness. In that, only, Place I my trust. My time, Sir, is too short For controversy: and that good man's duty Compels him to debate my creed. I thank himâ Pray you, Sir, say I thank him, from my heartâ For all his charities. In privacy My prayersânot unacceptable, I trust, To God my Saviourâhave been offered up. So must they to the end. BEDINGFIELD. At least permit me To seek the Queenâ JANE. Sir Henry, by no means. Her Grace is cumbered with affairs of state; And must no more be troubled for my sake. Think you I wish to live? Look on these weeds; This widow-garment! Life, to one like me, Is a drained vessel. As for death, being wholly Intent on the life to come, I disregard it. [A bier covered by a pall, is brought down from the scaffold: and carried across the stage. Ah! my poorheart!âstop, Sir! one moment stop! [She approaches the bier, lifts a hand from beneath the pall, wipes it with her handkerchief, kisses it; then rising, places the handkerchief in her bosom. Lie there, dear blood! over my heart, 'till death! Sir, pardon me this weakness. I am ready. Yet, hold! some words are due, before I die To the Queen's Grace, to Justice, and to England. My sentence hath been just; not for aspiring Unto the crown, but that, with guilty weakness, When proffered I refused it not. From me Let future times be warned that good intent Excuseth not misdeeds: all instruments Of evil must partake its punishment. Sir Henry, take my hand. Lead onâto heaven! [As she turns toward the scaffold, she starts, smiles, gradually looks upwards, raising her arms. I come, dear Love!âJesus, receive our souls! [As they ascend the scaffold the scene closes. Scene VII. Jane Grey's Prison in the Tower. An open window at the rear. Enter hurriedly, Mary, followed by Gardiner. MARY. She's goneâI come too lateâForgive me, God! Myself I neverâneverâshall forgive. Ha! from yon casement they may mark a signal! [She leans from the window. Hold! hold! [She draws back with a shriek. Great God! it isâit isâher head That demon lifts and brandishes before me! [She rushes from the window rubbing her eyes wildly. Pah! I am chokedâmy mouth is choked with bloodâ My eyesâmy nostrilsâswim in bloodâmy hair Stiffens with bloodâthe floor is slippery With bloodâallâblood! Mother and unborn babeâ Both slain!âMother and child!âThe cry of blood Rises to heavenâthe curse of Cain is launched Upon me! Innocent victims! at God's throne Already ye bear witness. Mercyâmercy! Spare one who knew not how to spare! [She kneels. Enter Fakenham. Ay,âkneel To heavenâand pray! lift up your hands to God! Lift up your voiceâyour heart! Pray, Sinner, pray! [The curtain falls. END OF PART FIRST.</field>
