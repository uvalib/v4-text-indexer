      <field name="fulltext">The King and Queenes Maiesty having signified their pleasure to haue a new Maske this New yeare, Master Inigo Iones and I were employed in the Invention And we agreed the subiect of it should be a Triumphe in ALBIPOLIS the chiefe City of ALBION. The Triumpher, ALBANACTVS, And ALBA this Ilands Goddesse. Names not improper, eyther for the Place, or for the Persons: ALBION being (as it once was) taken for England; ALBANACTVS, for the King, Quasi in Albanianatus: Borne in Scotland. And ALBA, for the Queene whose native Beauties have a great affinity with all Purity and Whitenesse. The Kings devoting himselfe to this Goddesse, is but the seeking of that happy Vnion which was preordeyned by the greatest of the Gods. IOVE therefore sends downe MERCVRY to ALBA, to acquaint her that he had decreed a Tryumph, which (a farre of) she might behold: Concealing his further Councells, vntill ALBANACTVS were subdued to Love and Chastity, by CVPID and DIANA, who descend, and having conquerd the Conquerer, They shew him the Queene. The King, yeilds, And presents himselfe a Suppliant, to the Goddesse ALBA. She embraces him, And makes him Copartner of her Deity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Description of the Scene. The first thing that presented it selfe to the eye, was the Ornament that went about the Scene: in the middest of which, was placed a great Armes of the Kings, with Angels holding an Emperiall Crowne, from which hung a Drapery, of crimson Velvet, fringed with gold, tackt in severall knotts, that on each side, with many folds, was wound about a Pillaster; in the freeze, were festones of severall fruites in their naturall colours, on which, in gratious postures lay Children sleeping; at each end was a double sheild, with a Gorgons head, and at the foot of the pillasters, on each side, stood two Women, the one young, in a watchet Robe looking vpwards, and on her head, a paire of Compasses of gold, the poynts standing towards Heaven: the other more ancient, and of a venerable aspect, apparreled in tawncy, looking downewards; in the one hand a long ruler, and in the other, a great paire of iron Compasses, one poynt whereof, stood on the ground, and the other touched part of the ruler. Above their heads, were fixt, compertiments of a new composition, and in that over the first, was written Theorica, and over the second Practica, shewing that by these two, all works of Architecture, and Ingining have their perfection. The Curtain being suddenly drawne vp, the first Sceane appeared, which represented a Romane Atrium, with high Collombs of white Marble, and ornaments of Architecture of a composed maner of great proiecture, enricht with carving, and betweene every retorne of these Collombs, stood Statues of gold on round pedestalls, and beyond these, were other peeces of Architecture of a Pallace royall. Over all was a serene skie, out of which a cloude began to breake foorth, and as it discended, a person was discovered, sitting in it, which by his Petasus and Caduceus, was knowne to be Mercury, the messenger of Iove. The first Song. Behold! I come not from above, To hyde, or hunt out wanton Love, Or doe what Man can doe: But to spred all my nimble wings, And like a God, doe Godlike things Gratefull, and Gratious too. Obserue! But see ye be not nyce, Prepare to give, and take advice, As wise-Menought to doe: Lest when your subtile witts haue done, Your Notes, like Motes, thought in the Sunne Proove farre beneath vs too. Admyre! but censure not their Powers, That sinke not with Times sandy howres, As mortall Creatures doe. And since the Shaft that is adrest, At Heaven may hurt the Shooters breast, Be pleas'd and please vs too. Orpheus, Amphion, Arion and three old Poets and Musicians more, rayled by this Charming Rod, reply from Earth. The first Chorus. Happy, thrice happy is that houre Wherein a God descends, Eyther in person, or in powre And Mans poore state befriends. MERCVRY descend to Earth, and attended by Orpheus, and the rest walkes vp, and drawing neere the person of the Goddesse ALBA, to a soft sweete Musicke that playes hehind him. In voce Recitativa, he declares the substance of his Commission. The second Song. Olimpian IOVE to the bright ALBA sends No vulgar God to beare his deare Commends. And with pure eyes, and a paternall hand, This Vniverse having survey'd, and span'd, In Councell with himselfe, he hath decreed, From fayre ALBIPOLIS shall soone proceede A Triumph: Mighty, as the Man design'd To weare those Bayes; Heroicke, as his mind; Iust, as his actions; Glorious, as his Reigne. And like his Vertues, Infinite in Treyne. Th' Immortall Swannes, contending for his Name, Shall beare it singing, to the House of Fame. And though at distance yet High IOVE is plea'd Your laboring eyes shall with his sight be eas'd, This from a God, vnto a Goddesse sent, A God Relates that could vse Complement: But when such States, negotiate by such meanes We speake in Acts, and scorne words trifling Scenes. Having delivered his Embassage MERCVRY gently retiring, Orpheus and his Poetick Quire Inspir'd with Divination sing. The second Chorus. Ye Powers Divine make roome, prepare a Seate On the Northside, for ALBAN ACT the Great, Earth is not fruitlesse: nor your nombers full, Ther's One to come will make some Starrs looke dull. Arrived at the Scene againe and meaning to reascend, MERCVRY finding some impediment by the way of question adresses himselfe to the Company. The third Song. MERCVRY. What mak's me so vnnimbly ryse, That did descend so fleete? There is no vp-hill in the skyes; Clouds stay not feathered feete. CHORVS. Thy wings are sing'd: and thou canst fly But slowly now, swift MERCVRY. MERCVRY. Some Lady heere, is sure too blame That from Loves starry skyes, Hath shot some Beame, or sent some flame, Like Lightning, from her Eyes. CHORVS. Taxe not the Starrs, with what the Sunne, Too neere aproch't (insens't) hath done. MERCVRY. I'le rowle me in Auroras Dew, Or lye in Tethis bed; Or from coole Iris begge a few, Pure Opale shewrs new shed. CHORVS. Nor Dew, nor shewers, nor sea can slake Thy quenchlesse heate, but Lethes lake. When MERCVRY is Re-assum'd into Heaven in Pompe. Here the Scene is changed into the Forum of the City of Albipolis, and Albanactus triumphing, attended like a Roman Emperor is scene a farre off to passe in pomp. The Scene is turned into an Amphitheater, with people sitting in it, a Patritian and a Plebeian come forth, &amp;c. Enter Platonicus and Publius. Pub. Though I have earn'd it with the sweat of my browes in Ianuary, yet I am glad I saw it, for there never was such a sight scene. Pla. What sight Publius? Pub. The Triumph. Pla. Whose Tryumph? Pub. The Triumph of ALBANACTVS. Pla. Didst thou see it? Pub. See it, yes, and feele it too. Every one there (I can assure you) went not vpon his owne feete. Pla. No, I thinke, some rid. Pub. They did so; for some rid me. Some trode on my toes. Some cryed, some kept it in; for my part, I confest all, for feare I should have beene prest to death. Pla. Though thy body was pincht, thine eyes were feasted. Pub. Were not yours so too? Pla. Yes. Pub. Where stood you? Pla. I stood not, Pub. You had the better friends sir, I pray where sate you? Pla. In my studdy. Pub. Is not your studdy backward? with a shop-light in it, where one can see nothing but the skye? Pla. I confesse it, what of that? Pub. Why then you saw no Triumph. Pla. But I did, and a true one, thine was but a shew. Pub. If what I saw was but a shew, what you saw was but a shadow, or at the most a Vision. For it seemes your body kept home, though your spirit walkt. Pla. It did so. And travelled to better purpose then most men doe, that goe, and see, and say, but know nothing. Pub. To confute that Heresie of yours, I have gone, and seene, and know, but I will say nothing. Pla. That's impossible; The meate thou hast lately fed vpon, is so windy, out it must, thou wilt burst else. Pub. Faith sir, I am very full indeede. Pla. Purge then, and tell thy Doctor all. Pub. ALBANACTVS CÃSAR from his sumptuous Pallace, through the high-streets of ALBIPOLIS rid Triumphing, on a Chariot, madeâ Pla. Of wood, perhaps guilt, perhaps gold. But I will save you all those charges, if you will goe on to the Persons and let the Pagents alone. Pub. Sir I saw him not as he was borne, naked, but since you affect such brevity, I saw the King and a great deale more, and so I turn'd my backe, and went away. Pla. Nay good Publius, now thou art too briefe. Pub. When you beginne to tell your dreames, I'le not iogge you, till you wake of your selfe. Pla. Nay prethee be not angry. Pub. I am not angry, but a little short-winded vpon occasion. Yet to give you some satisfaction because you have done me wrong. Before CÃSAR March't Captive Kings, with their hands bound. And Ladies, with their Armes acrosse, furious wild Beasts, great Giants, and little Dwarfes with Lictors, and Pictors, and a number of Priests that were as you would have them, In their shirts. These with certaine Princes that were behind him: made vp a Triumph too great to come out of any mortall mans mouth. Pla. That's most certaine. Pub. I meane in words. But as you hunt me you would hunt a Hare off her leggs. Pla. I confesse thou hast made more haste, then good speede: But for a supplement to thy lame Story, Know, I have seene this brave ALBANACTVS CÃSAR, seene him with the eyes of vnderstanding, vew'd all his Actions; look't into his Mind: which I finde armed with so many morall vertues that he dayly Conquers a world of Vices, which are wild Beasts indeede. For example Ambition, is a Lyon; Cruelty, a Beare; Avarice, a Wolfe. Yet He subdues them all. To be short, no Vyce is so small, to scape him: Nor so great, but he overcomes it: And in that fashion he Triumphes over all the Kings, and Queenes that went before him. All his Passions, are his true Subiects: And Knowledge, Iudgment, Merit, Bounty and the like, are fit Commanders, for such a Generall, These Triumph with him, And these are the Princes you saw about him. And this Publius, is more then you can finde in the streete. Pub. I graunt it, But yet graunt me one Request deare Platonicus? Pla. What's that? Pub. Goe but with me to the Amphitheater. Pla. To Gaze. Pub. Yes. Pla. Why beforehand I know there will be Gladiators, Saltators, and sights to please the People. Were not thou better stay here, and see CÃSAR present himselfe to this fayre Goddesse, seeking sweete rest, after all his labors. Pub. I should sleepe at such a sight. Pla. Then after a Play, thou art all for a Pryze. Pub. All together, and so (I hope) are you Pla. At this time, I am. For I will goe with thee, if it be but to teach thee to Reade in thy owne Booke. Outsides, have Insides, Shells, have Kernells in them. And vnder every Fable, nay (almost) vnder every thing, lyes a Morrall. Publius stumbles at a stone, and stoops to take it vp. What art thou doing Publius. Pub. Lifting vp the stone I stumbled at. Pla. To what ende? Pub. To see what lyes vnder it. Pla. What should lye vnder a stone, but a Worme, or a Hoglouse. Pub. If there lye not a Morall vnder it, then have you taught me false Doctrine. Pla. Such thankes have they that teach such Schoolers. Come away Foole, they beginne to throng to the Theater. Such kind of pastimes as Victorious Emperors were wont to present as spectacles to the People, are heere produced for Anti-Maskes vpon the stage. The Anti-Maskes enter. First, Fooles â 6 Secondly, Saltators or Tumblers. â 7 Thirdly, Pugili or Buffeters â 3 Fourthly, Satyrslike Dauncers â 2 Fiftly, One Giant, and Pigmies â 5 Sixtly, Gladiators or Fencers â 4 Seventhly, Mimicks or Morescoes â 7 This Enterlude being past, CVPID emulating the glory of an Invict Conquerer, descends; Invokes DIANA: And invites her to set upon these yet unconquer'd Conquerers. She appeares in her Chariot, and he in a Cloud. The Description of the Maskers and the Place. The Scene is changed into a pleasant Grove of straight Trees, which rising by degrees to a high place, openeth it selfe to discover the aspect of a stately Temple; All which, was sacred to IOVE; In this groue, satt the Emperour ALBANACTVS, attended by fourteene Consuls, who stood about him, not set in ranks, but in severall gratious postures, attending his commands: his habite, like a Romane Emperour in a Curase of yellow Sattin embrodered with siluer, his gorget clincant, cut round, and on his breast an Angels head imbost of gold, the Labells of the sleeues, and short Bases of watchet embrodered with the same, the vnder sleenes, and long stockings of white, on his head a Burgonet richly enchast with siluer, turn'd vp before in a scrowle, with an artificiall wreath of Lawrell, out of which, sprang rayes like a piked Crowne, the habite of the Consuls were after the same manner, excepting the rayes of gold, issuing from his Lawrell wreath. The Dialogue betweene Cvpid and Diana. Cvpid. Sit not secure, nor thinke in case Still vndispleas'd, your selues to please: Diana, Chast Diana stoope, And helpe to wound this warlike troope. Diana. Wants Love a Bowe, or shast of mine? This suit will make my Crescent shine. Cvpid. Love is grown wise, and meanes to bring To his smart Bowe, a double string. Behold our Marke? taks't thou not pride In such a Glory to devide? Diana. I doe, I doe, since I am sure, When we two ioyne, our flames are pure. Cvpid and Diana. As pure, and Cleere, as Albas skin, As her faire Fame, or thoughts within: Pure as my selfe; nay pure like Thee, Now Love is that which Love should be. They come vpon the Scene, and the Clowde and Charriot goe vp. The Chorus below sing. Bow bearing Gods, shoote, shoote, and hit, And make our CÃ¦sar greater yet: Yet leave him with vs, Let him shine Still heere; And make him all Devine Cupid and Diana shoot at the Maskers and ALBANACTVS yeilding to the Gods, mooves downe the steps in a stately pace to Musick made by the Chorus of Sacrificers, that sing as the Maskers descend. The fourth Song. Ye Worthies of this Ile, That led by your brave Chiefe, In an Heroick style, Have overdone Beliefe: Subdu'd by ALBAS eyes Come downe, Loves Sacrifice! It is no shame to yeild, Where t'is in veyne to strive: The Gods would quit the field, Should they these warres revive Or Conquerd, by her Eyes, Come downe Loves Sacrifice. Streight Cedar, that hast stood, The shock of many a wind: The top of this Tall wood, By a high hand design'd Subdu'd by ALBAS Eyes, Come downe Loves Sacrifice! When the Maskers are all come downe the steps, the High Priests and Sacrificers, treading a grave Measure walke vp toward the Queene singing. The fift Song. Great ALBA though eche Grande heere, At this High Court of thine, Like a true Liege Man doth appeere, And offers at thy Shryne: It is no Conquest for thine Eyes, When petty Princes fall, That are some single Beauties pryse, Or a lone Vertues Thrall: Heere comes the Trophe of thy prayse, The Monarch of these Iles, The Mirror of thy Cheerefull Rayes, And Glory of thy Smyles: The Vertues and the Graces all, Must meete in one, when such Starrs fall. The King and the Maskers dance the mayne Maske. Afterward taking his seat by the Queene. The Scene is varied into a Landscipt, in which was a prospect of the Kings Pallace of Whitehall, and part of the Citie of London, seene a farre off, and presently the whole heauen opened, and in a bright cloud were seene sitting fiue persons, representing Innocency, Iustice, Religion, Affection to the Countrey, &amp; Concord, being all Companions of Peace, and thus attired. Innocency, a woman in a pure white robe, with a garland of flowers on her head: Iustice, a woman in a yallow garment richly adorned, her mantle white, and on her head golden rayes, in her right hand a sword, and in the middest thereof an Emperiall Crowne: Religion, a woman in a short Surplusse of lawne full gathered about the neck, and vnder it a garment of watchet, with a short vale of siluer, and about her head, beames of gold like the Sunne, and in her left hand, shee held a booke open: Affection to the Countrey, a young man in a Coat armour of yallow, with a purple Mantle, his buskins adorned, his plumed Helme of siluer, and in his hand a Garland of long grasse: Concord, a man in a skie coloured Robe, and a yallow Mantle; on his head a Garland of wheate, and in his hand a bunch of arrowes tyed together with a white band, these moving towards the earth sing together as followeth. Praysing their Piety, and wishing they may perpetuate themselues by a Royall Posterity, Present them with severall Gifts. The sixth Song sung by the five Deities. Bles't Payre whose prayers like Incence rise, Opening, and pulling downe the Skies Take your Reward! Iust as yee mett, So hand in hand live many a Day, And may your Vertuous minds beget Issue that never shall decay, And so be fruitfull every way. May Plenty Proteus like appeare, Varying your Pleasures every yeare. Wee five come freely to impart, Such favors as we can afforde: One gives his Concord. Hand, the next his Affection to the Countrey. Heart, The third her Inocence. Robe, the fourth her Iustice. Sword, The fifth full many a Religion. Suppliant Word. And to fulfill your future Blisse, Sweete Peace salutes you with a Kisse. Then from the vpper part of the heauen, was seene to follow this: Another more beautifull cloud, in which alone triumphant sat Peace, a woman in a carnation Robe richly adorned, a vale of silver, and on it a Garland of Olive, and in her hand a branch of Palme, Proclaiming her large Benefits, And the Worlds Ingratitude. Peace Sings alone the seventh Song. Frighted by Day; And in the Night diseas'd, I fled to Heaven, and left the World displeas'd. Find Men that strive more for a Province there, Then looking vpward to possesse a Sphere: Yet vanquish't and Victorious, both at last, Their weary Limmes, on my soft Bed would cast. The Five in the lower Clowde confessing her great Bounty, Answere. The Five. Two 2 Lyons, and Lambs togeather lye, When Lovly Peace stands smiling by Two 2 Temples and Townes by thy stay'd hand, First learne to Rise, And then to Stand. All 5 'Tis not the Laurel Tree that brings, Anointing Oyle for sacred Kings: Those Princes see the happiest Dayes, Whose Olive Branches stand for Bayes. When the fiue persons which first descended were come to the earth, the cloud that bare them, was in an instant turned into a richly adorned Throne. And out of the foure corners of the Scene proceede 4. Gods, Neptune, Plutus, Bellona, and Cebele, complaining of ease and Plenty The eighth Song. Armes are layd by: Earely and late, The Traueller goes safe to Bed: Men eate and Drinke in Massie Plate, And are with Deinties dayly fed. Why should this Ile aboue the rest, Be made (great Gods) the Halcions nest? The 5. Deities thus resolue them. Imperious Peace her selfe Descends The foure Gods. Then here our search, and wonder ends, Wee'l steale away Peace. Earths Rulers, stay! The foure Gods. Doth soft Peace call? Peace. Yes: and will streight employ yee All. The foure Gods How, and wherein? The 5. in the lower Clowde. Give eare, your Charge doth now begin. Peace gives them their Charge. Neptune to Sea, And let no Sayle, Meete Albions Fleete, But make it veile. Bellona Arme, That Foes may see, Their Lillies kept by Lyons be. Their fruitfull fields (Cebele) make Pay Centuple for all they take. And let Both Indies (Pluto) meete, And lay their wealth at ALBAS feete. The foure Gods; reply When Peace commands such pleasing things, From Love and Time wee'l steale their wings. For a Conclusion, the Gods, Poets, and Priests ioyne, and sing a Valediction to Hymens Twin the MARY-CHARLES. The last generall Chorus. Loaden with Wealth and Honor may, These Gods returne to crowne this Day, And Mary-Charles whose mindes within, And Bodyes make but Hymens Twin, Long live they so, And Brest, to Brest, May Angels sing them to their Rest.
