      <field name="fulltext">À VICTOR HUGO. Comme un fleuve qui donne à l'océan son âme, J'apporte au lieu sacré d'où le vers tonne et luit Mon drame épique et plein de tumulte et de flamme, Où vibre un siècle éteint, où flotte un jour qui fuit. Un peuple qui rugit sous les pieds d'une femme Passe, et son souffle emplit d'aube et d'ombre et de bruit Un ciel âpre et guerrier qui luit comme une lame Sur l'avenir debout, sur le passé détruit. Au fond des cieux hagards, par l'orage battue, Une figure d'ombre et d'étoiles vêtue Pleure et menace et brille en s'évanouissant; Éclair d'amour qui blesse et de haine qui tue, Fleur éclose au sommet du siècle éblouissant, Rose à tige épineuse et que rougit le sang.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. DAVID RIZZIO. Time, March 9, 1566. Scene I. —Holyrood. Enter Darnley and Mary Carmichael. Darnley. But you will not believe me though you hear; You have no faith; you steer by sight, and see This fellow gilt and garnished with her grace Sit covered by the queen where lords stand bare And jet before them lordlier; and the sight Makes firm your faith that in his hand and eye This land is but a harp to play upon, Whose strings may turn to serpents or to swords To maim his hand or charm his eye to death. You have no faith to see this, or to read The sentence that ensuing shall write me king, And worth men's fears or faiths: lo, now you laugh, As though my hope were braggart, and myself A fool and mouthpiece of its foolish vaunt: You have no faith. Mary Carmichael. I have no wit nor will To choose between St. David for my lord And sweet St. Henry. Darnley. Nay, King David now, King David psalmist; but for all his song I doubt he hath lost the old trick of touch he had Once in the sword-play. Mary Carmichael. See you play not Saul, Who are something of his stature in our eyes, Much of his mighty presence; be it not said He hath snipt your skirts already. Darnley. Who said that? Who speaks of me so, lies to the blood and bone, To the heart and soul lies. I am no king mayhap— I do not say yet I shall die no king— God knows that, and is wise—but man I am, Look else, who love you— Mary Carmichael. Sir, be king for me, It shall content my will to youward, seeing I take you to be royal, and myself Honest. Darnley. Why honest? what a gibe is this! What make you of me? Mary Carmichael. Yea, what should I make? 'Tis time I were on service. Darnley. O, the queen's? She gets good service, excellent service done, And worthy servants hath she—a liberal queen. Well, if you will. [Exit Mary Carmichael. I would the month were out, If earth were easier by just one less knave, I might sleep well and laugh and walk at ease Enter Morton. With none to mate me.—Ah, my good lord and friend, I had somewhat I would say—but let words be. The man you know of—I would you had made him safe; I would have told you this much. Morton. Sir, the earl Murray being with us in the main thing here, Though he keep hand from the red handiwork, Shall enough help us. Darnley. Let him know it not then: Let him stand by: he must not know it. Why, well, It is the more our honour: yet would God He, being not with us, were not anywhere, But dead, sir, dead. I say, who hath eyes to see May see him dangerous to us, and manifest. Ye have no eyes who see not: for my part, I noted him at once. Sir, by this light, When I first saw him—and I have eyes to see— I knew what manner of meaning in his face Lay privy and folded up and sealed and signed. I would you lords had sight and heart like mine, He would not long live dangerous; yet, God wot, For my poor personal peril I would match This body against his better. Morton. There's no need Of iron words and matches here of men, Save this we meet upon; which being played out Leaves our hands full and henceforth peaceable. For the earl, he makes no part of men's designs, Nor would I have you keen to strive with him Who lies yet still and is well liked of men That are well-willers to this common state And the open peace of the people. Let him be; Keep your heart here. Darnley. Here is it fixed and set With roots of iron. 'Tis more honour to us, Being so more perilous, to have no help Of popular hands and common friendliness, But our hearts helpful only. I am sure of her, That she suspects not—I do surely think: But yet she is subtle and secret-souled and wise, Wise woman-fashion; look you be not caught Through too much trust in what of her is weak, In her light mind and mutability, For subtlety lies close in her light wit, And wisdom wantons in her wantonness: I know her, I know her; I have seen ere now, and am Not all to learn in women. Morton. I believe Your grace hath grace with women as with men, And skill of sense alike in those and these, I doubt not; which is well and profitable. For this, how shall she know it, except you slip And let her wring the truth out from your hand, Or kiss the truth out, hanging mouth on mouth? But if no pressure press from hand or lip The unripe truth, the fruit so soon so red, What can she to us, though doubting, help or harm? How, if she know not surely? Darnley. So I say. And we that do it, we do it for all men's good, For the main people's love, thankworthily— And this is matter of law we take in hand, Is it not, lawful? for the man is judged, Doomed dead and damned by sentence, in good deed, Though not by scruple and show of trial and test, By clearer cause and purer policy— We cannot stand toward any accountable As for a slaughter, a treasonable shame, To mark us red in the world's eyes? no man Can say our fame is blotted with his blood, No man, albeit he hate us, bring in doubt— Woman or man—our right, our absolute law, Giving us leave—nay, bidding us do so? So that we stand after the deed as now, In no more danger or fear? Morton. In less fear, you, And much more honour; now it might please you fear, Being overborne of woman and fast bound With feminine shame and weakness; the man's strength, The sinew and nerve and spirit of royalty, Hers, and all power to use her power on you Hers, and all honour and pleasure of high place That should make sweet your lips and bright your brows Hers, and the mockery of mismarried men Yours. Darnley. Nay, by God I said so; why, I knew it; I told you thus aforetime, did I not? Morton. Truly and wisely; if this content you thus, He is even our king. Darnley. Methinks he should be king, And I, God wot, content. Here came a man Some few days back, a goodly, a gentleman, An honourable, that for king knave's behoof Was stript out of the better of all his lands As I of what was best part of my wife, My place, and honour that grows up with hers— For of her love small fruit was left to strip, Few leaves for winter weather—but of these, These good things, am I stript as bare as shame, Even beggared as was this man. By God's light, It seems this is but justice, doth it not, And I so gentle and temperate—as, by God, I was not nor I will not. Morton. There's more need That you seem resolutely temperate then And temperately be resolute, I say, Till the hour to cast off temperance and put on Plain passion for the habit of your heart Which now it wears in darkness, and by day The cloak and hood of temperance. But these fits And gusts and starts of will and will not, these Blow you this side and that side till men see Too much, and trust too little. Darnley. O sir, you are wise, You are honourable, and a counsellor, and my friend, And I too light, too light—yet by this light I think I am worth more than your counsel is If I be worth this work here to be done— I think I am so much. Morton. It may well be, sir, And you much wiser; yet forbear your wrath If you would have it ready to your hand. Darnley. I will forbear nothing—nor nothing bear— Nor live by no man's bidding. This year through I have even been surfeited with wise men's breath And winds of wordy weather round mine ears— Do this, spare that, walk thus, look otherwise, Hold your head kingly, or wisely bow your neck— A man might come to doubt himself no man, Being so long childlike handled. Now, look you, Look she, look God to it if I be not man! Now is my way swept, and my foot shod now, My wallet full now for the travelling day That I fare forth and forward, arrow-straight, Girt for the goal, red battle-ripe at need— As need there is—you are sure—and utter need? Morton. Is my lord not sure? Darnley. Ay, as sure as you— Surer maybe—the need is more of mine— This grazes your bare hand that grates my heart: Your queen it is wrongs you, and me my wife. Morton. You see that sure, too? sharp sight, have you not? Darnley. I saw it, I first—I knew her—who knew her but I, That swore—at least I swore to mine own soul, Would not for shame's sake swear out wide to the world, But in myself swore with my heart to hear— There was more in it, in all their commerce, more Than the mere music—he is warped, worn through, Bow-bent, uncomely in wholesome eyes that see Straight, seeing him crooked—but she seeing awry Sees the man straight enough for paramour. This I saw, this I swore to—silently, Not loud but sure, till time should be to speak Sword's language, no fool's jargon like his tongue, But plain broad steel speech and intelligible, Though not to the ear, Italian's be it or Scot's, But to the very life intelligible, To the loosed soul, to the shed blood—for blood There must be—one must slay him—you are sure—as I am? For I was sure of it always—while you said, All you, 'twas council-stuff, state-handicraft, Cunning of card-play between here and there, I knew 'twas this and more, sir, I kept sight, Kept heed of her, what thing she was, what wife, What manner of stateswoman and governess— More than all you saw—did you see it or I? Morton. You saw first surely, and some one spoke first out— You had eyes, he tongue—and both bear witness now If this must be or not be. Darnley. Death, is that? I must kill—bid you kill him? Morton. Nowise, sir; As little need of one as the other is here; As little of either as no need at all. Darnley. You doubt or hand or tongue then, sir, of mine? I would not strike, if need were, or bid strike? Morton. Neither we doubt, nor neither do we need— Having you with us. Darnley. 'Twas but so you meant? I had else been angry—nay, half wroth I was— Not as I took it—I had else been wroth indeed. Morton. That had been grievous to me and perilous, This time of all times. Darnley. Ay, you need me, ay, I am somewhat now then, somewhat more than wont, Who thus long have been nothing—but will be? Well, so, I am with you. Shall he die—how soon? To-day I had said, but haply not to-day— There might fall somewhat, something slip awry, In such swift work, ha? Then, what day? Perchance 'Twere better he died abed—or were there charms, Spells—if himself though be not witch, drug-proof 'Tis like, and devil-witted, being a knave Born poisonous and bred sorcerous like his kind— We have heard what manner of plague his south land spawns, What sort of kith and kin to hell and him, How subtle in starry riddles and earth's roots The dog-leeches that kill your soul in you, Or only body, or both, as Catherine please, Mother that was to our Mary—have we not? We must look to it, and closely look. Morton. My lord, Of so much being so sure, of this be too; That surely and soon in some wise very sure We are quit of him with God's help or without. Darnley. Why, that were well. I hold you resolute; I pray you stay so, and all is well enough. We have talked our time out—you had all to say— All the thing's carriage—and my mind to take, Which with plain heart I have made you understand. My mind is, he must die then: keep you there. [Exit. Morton. Had God but plagued Egypt with fools for flies, His Jews had sped the quicker. Enter Mary Beaton. Is the queen risen, Lady? Mary Beaton. Not yet. Was not the king with you? I heard him high and shrill. Morton. Ay, he was here, If anywhere the king be. You are sad. Mary Beaton. I am not blithe of bearing, I wot well, But the word sad is sadder than I am. Is he not vexed? Morton. I have never seen him else, Save when light-heartedness and loose-hung brain Have made him proud and drunken: as of late He has been but seldom. There's one sad at least; If it be sad to hang the head apart, Walk with brows drawn and eyes disquieted, Speak sullen under breath, and shrug and swear, If any move him, and then again fall dumb; He has changed his fresher manner, and put off What little grace made his ungracious youth Fair in men's eyes a little; if this last, He will not long last in men's lordship here, Except by love and favour shown of the queen. Mary Beaton. There he sits strong in surety; yet men say He is discontent, disheartened, for distaste Of the like love and favour shown of her (Or not the like, yet too much near the like) Toward Rizzio; but such men, seeing visionary, Run wide in talk, and sleep with speech awake And sight shut fast: are you not of my mind? Morton. I am most of theirs whose mind is most toward hers, As whose should be most noble; but in truth Mine own is moved to hear her gracious heart Mismade of, her clear courtesies misread, Misliked her liking, her good-will maligned, Even of his mouth who owes life, breath, and place, Honour and title, even to that clear good-will, To that her grace, liking, and courtesy. Mary Beaton. You mean our lord and hers and King of Scots? Morton. As kingly a king as masterful a lord, And no less hers than ours; as strong each way. Mary Beaton. And he misreads so much the queen's pure heart As to mistake aloud her manner of life, And teach the world's broad open popular ear His graceless commentary on her mere grace And simple favour shown a simple knave, Her chamber-child, her varlet? a poor man, Stranger, skilled little in great men's policies —Which is strange too, seeing he hath had some chance To learn some tricks of courts and embassies, Being therein bred, and not so very a fool But one might teach him—yet no doubt a man, Save for such teaching, simple and innocent; Only what heart, what spirit and wit he has, Being hot and close as fire on the old faith's side And the French party's—if his wit were great, It might do more than simple service soon, Having her heart as 'twere by the ear which leans Still toward his saying or singing; but ye know There is no peril in him, and the king More fool than he a knave. Morton. Well, I know not; My skill is small in tunes, yet I can tell Discord between kings' ear and people's tongue, Which hearing as in spirit I forehear Harsh future music in a state mistuned, If such men lay but hand upon the keys, Touch ne'er so slight a string of policy With ne'er so light a finger: I would the queen, For the dear faith I bear her, saw but this, Or that the lords were heavier-eyed to see. Mary Beaton. Are they so keen of soul as of their sight, To slay wrong as to see wrong? Morton. Faith, with us The hand is matched against the eye for speed; And these no slower in stroke of sight and sword Than their sharp-sighted swift-souled forefathers. I say not this that you should gather fear Out of my saying to sow in the ear of the queen; But for truth's sake; and truly I do not fear That I have put fear in you, for you seem Not lightly fearful to me. Mary Beaton. I would not be, Where I might keep good heart and open eye Nor blind nor fevered with foolhardiness, As here meseems I may keep; for I see No hurt yet nor hurt's danger steer in sight, Save the mere daily danger of high-raised heads To be misspoken and misseen of men, Which is not for high-seated hearts to fear. Morton. Her heart is high enough, and yours as hers; You shall do well to hold your courage fast, Keeping your wits awake; whereof myself I make no doubt, howbeit men fear the queen, Having our bitter folk and faith to fight, Out of sharp spirit and high-heartedness May do such things for love's sake or for wrath's As fools for fear's sake: which were no less harm (Turning her wit and heart against herself) Than to be coward or witless. Fare you well; I will not doubt but she is well advised. [Exit. Mary Beaton. He is but dead by this then. I did know it; And yet it strikes upon me sudden and sharp, As a thing unforethought on. It is strange To have one's foot as mine is on the verge, The narrowing threshold of a thing so great, To have within one's eyeshot the whole way, The perfect reach of fate from end to end, From life to life replying and death to death. This is the first hour of the night, and I The watcher of the first watch, by whose lamp The starless sky that grows toward birth of stars And the unlit earth and obscure air are seen Pale as the lamp's self yet not well alight. Yet by the light of my heart's fire, and mind Kindled, I see what fires of storm, what flaws, What windy meteors and cross-countering stars, Shall be through all the watches to the dawn And bloodlike sunrise of the fire-eyed day. I am half content already; and yet I would This watch were through. Enter the Queen, Rizzio, and Mary Seyton. Queen. Nay, it is later, sure: I am idle, I am idle, and flattered; you say wrong, To find my sloth some pardonable plea, Which is not pardonable; a perfect sin, One writ among the sorest seven of all; Enough to load the soul past penitence. Am I not late indeed? speak truth and say. Rizzio. To watchers the sun rises ever late Though he keep time with summer; but your grace Keeps earlier than the sun's time. Queen. 'Tis but March, And a scant spring, a sharp and starveling year. How bitter black the day grows! one would swear The weather and earth were of this people's faith, And their heaven coloured as their thoughts of heaven, Their light made of their love. Rizzio. If it might please you Look out and lift up heart to summer-ward, There might be sun enough for seeing and sense, To light men's eyes at and warm hands withal. Queen. I doubt the winter's white is deeper dyed And closer worn than I thought like to be; This land of mine hath folded itself round With snow-cold, white, and leprous misbelief, Till even the spirit is bitten, the blood pinched, And the heart winter-wounded; these starved slaves That feed on frost and suck the snows for drink, Heating the light for the heat's sake, love the cold: We want some hotter fire than summer or sun To burn their dead blood through and change their veins. Rizzio. Madam, those fires are all but ashen dust: 'Tis by the sun we have now to walk warm. If I had leave to give good counsel tongue And wisdom words to work with, I would say Rather by favour and seasonable grace Shall your sweet light of summer-speaking looks Melt the hard mould of earthen hearts, and put Spring into spirits of snow. Your husband here, Who was my friend before your lord, being grown Doubtful, and evil-eyed against himself, With a thwart wit crossing all counsel, turns From usward to their close fierce intimacy Who are bitterest of the faction against faith, And through their violent friendship has become His own and very enemy, being moved Of mere loose heart to vex you. Now there stands On the other hand, in nowise bound to him, But as your rebel and his enemy Cast forth condemned, one that called home again Might be a bond between the time and you, Tying the wild world tamer to your hand, And in your husband's hot and unreined mouth As bit and bridle against his wandering will. Queen. What name is his who shall so strengthen me? Rizzio. Your father gave him half a brother's name. Queen. I have no brother; a bloodless traitor he is Who was my father's bastard born. By heaven, I had rather have his head loose at my foot Than his tongue's counsel rounded in mine ear. Rizzio. I would you had called him out of banishment. Queen. Thou art mad, thou art mad; prate me no more of him. Rizzio. He is wise, and we need wisdom; penitent, And God they say loves most his penitents; Stout-hearted and well-minded toward your grace, As you shall work him, and beguilable Now at your need if you but will he be; And God he knows if there be need of such. Queen. No need, no need; I am crowned of mine own heart And of mine own will weaponed; am I queen To have need of traitors' leave to live by, and reign By the God's grace of these? I will not have it; Toward God I swear there shall be no such need Rizzio. Yet if there were no need, less harm it were To have him easily on your royal side While the time serves that he may serve you in— Less harm than none, and profit more than less. Queen. He is a misborn traitor and heretic; And of his own side baffled, a flat fool, Who thought to have comfort of Elizabeth, Large furtherance of my sweet-souled sister's love, Grace and sure aid of her good plighted word, Her honourable and precious plighted word, And secret seal to help him; as she durst not, Yea, she would fain and durst not. Rizzio. Please you note— Queen. It shall not please me; I say she hath made him kneel, (And this does please me indeed) hath seen him down, Seen him and spurned him kneeling from her foot, As my born traitor and subject. David, nay, But hath thy careful love not made thee mad, Whose counsel was my sword against him once? Why, thou wast sworn his slayer, and all that while He held up head against us thy one word Bade strike him dead of all men. What, hast thou Fairly forgot his purpose, were I taken, To speed thee out of life? his secret bond, Sealed with himself in spirit, thou shouldst die? Wast thou not trothplight with that soulless boy Ere he might thee, to rid him out of life? Nay, and thou knowest how dear a cause I have, And thou, to slay him when the good chance comes, Which God make speedy toward us; by my hand, Too little and light to hold up his dead head, It was my hope to dip it in his life Made me ride iron-mailed and soldieress All those days through we drove them here and there, Eastward from Fife, and hither and forth again, And broken to the border; yea, all day I thought how worth his life it were to ride Within the shot-length of my saddlebow And try my poor a maiden soldiership. And now I am bidden, and you it is bid me, Reach my hand forth forgivingly and meek To strike with his for love and policy? He is beaten and broken, without help of hope, Who was mine enemy ever, and ever I knew How much he was mine enemy; and now maimed, Wounded, unseated from his power of place, Shall I raise up again and strengthen him, Warm and bind up his cold and o'erbled wounds With piteous cordials? nay, but when I do, May he have strength to wreak his will on me, And I be flung under his feet! beside, He was your mocking stock this short while since, You swore, men tell me, Daniot told it me, Your ghostly man of counsel—why, to him, He says, you swore the bastard should not bide With you in Scotland; it made anger at you, Put passion in their mouths who bear you hard, That you should threaten kinglike. Hath he moved you To change your heart and face toward him at once, Or do you mock, or are struck mad indeed, That now you turn to bid me cry him home, Make much of him and sing him to my side? Rizzio. For all this, madam, if I be not mad, It were well done to do it. He is a man Well-loved, well-counselled, and though fast in faith, Yet howsoever in strong opinion bound, Not so much over-ridden of his own mind As to love no man for faith's single sake; No fire-brained preacher nor wild-witted knave, But skilled and reared in state and soldiership. What doth it need you to misthink of me? Say it is but this jewel he sends me here That pleads his part before you; say I am his And not your servant, or not only of you Made and again unmakeable; 'tis truth, He hath given me gifts to be his counsel to you, And I have taken, and here I plead his part, Seeing my life hangs upon your life, and yours, If it be full and even and fortunate In spite of foes and fears and friends, must hang On his, unbound from these and bound to you. We have done ill, having so mighty a match, So large a wager on this turn of time, To leave the stakes in hand of a lewd boy, A fool and thankless; and to save the game We must play privily and hold secret hands. Queen. I will not have his hand upon my part, Though it were safe to sweep up gold and all. Rizzio. But till our side be strong; then cast him off, When he hath served to strengthen you so much You have no need of any strength of his. Bear with him but till time be and we touch The heart of the hour that brings our chance to catch Hope by the flying hair, and to our wheel Bind fortune and wind-wavering majesty, To shift no more in the air of any change, But hang a steady star; then, when the faith Sits crowned in us that serve her, and you hold The triple-treasured kingdom in your lap, What shall forbid you set a sudden foot Where it may please you, on their hearts or heads That in their season were found serviceable, And now are stones of stumbling? Time shapes all: And service he may do you, or else offence, Even as you handle this sharp point of time, To turn its edge this wary way or that; And for the land and state, why, having served, He may be seasonably stript out of these When you would do some friend a courtesy Who has still been found secret and Catholic, A lantern's eye of counsel in close dark, While he did blind man's service; but till then Let him keep land and name, and all he will, And blindly serve to the blind end in trust, To wake a naked fool. That this may be, I am firm in faith, may it be but with your will. Queen. He will not help us beat his own faith down; He is no hawk to see and then to unhood, Fly at strange fowl and pluck back blind again. Rizzio. Bethink you, madam, he only of all his kind Stood out against men hotter in heresy, Spake down their speeches, overbore Pope Knox, Broke with his cardinal's college of shrewd saints, In your free faith's defence, that would have barred you From custom of religion; and I wot, Save for his help, small help had found my queen From Huntley or Hamilton, her faith-fellows, Or any their co-worshippers with her. Queen. Thou art ever saying them wrong; they are stout and sure, Even they that strove for honour's sake with us: Their one least fault I am minded to forgive; True friends in faith, my dear own blood and kin, No birthless bastards nor mis-titled men. It pleased me bid him into banishment, And shall not lightly please me bid him back. Rizzio. Yet some men banished for no less a cause It has been known you have loosed from banishment. I tell you for true heart. Queen. Nay, I well know it; You are good and faithful to us, God quit it you, And well of us loved back; how much, you know, But more than is our fear of men's missaying. For me, I find no such foul faultiness In the lord Bothwell but might well be purged After long trial of English prison-bands And proof of loyal lips and close true heart Whereout no gaoler could pluck dangerous speech, And then with over-passing to and fro The strait sea wide enough to wash him white 'Twixt France and us: and all this jarring year You have seen with what a service, in full field, Oft in our need he hath served us; nor was it Such matter of treason and nowise pardonable To mix his wits with Arran's broken brain In their device to entrap mine hand with his For high state's sake and strong-winged policy, When he was matched with me in most men's mouths And found not yet for changeling or for fool. But howsoever, it pleased me pardon him; And a stout spear for warden have I won. I have holp myself in help of him, who now Hath with good works undone his dead misdeeds, And left their memory drowned in the under sea That swept them out and washed him in again, A man re-made; and fail me whoso fails, Him I hold fast my friend; but those cast out That rose up right between my will and me To make me thrall and bondslave to their own, Giving me prison and them swift banishment Whom I gave honour, and cast the crown away, And break the old natural heart of royalty, For foul faith's sake or craft of their miscreed; That smote with sword or speech against all state, Not through blind heat or stumbling hardihood, But hate of holiness and height of mind, Hateful to kingly truth, haters of kings; Them, though I pardon, I would not take to trust, Nor bind up their loose faith with my belief, For all assurances of all men born. Besides, I hate him, singly. Rizzio. I have said, and say; Do you as time will turn it; time turns all. Queen. I do believe there is no man's estate So miserable, so very a helpless thing, So trodden under and overborne as mine. For first the man that I set up for lord, For master of mine and mate of only me, Have I perforce put forth of my shamed bed And broken on his brows the kingless crown, Finding nor head for gold nor hand for steel Worth name of king or husband, but the throne Lordless, the heart of marriage husbandless, Through his foul follies; then in the utter world, In the extreme range and race of my whole life Through all changed times and places of its change, Having one friend, I find a foe of him To my true sense and soul and spirit of thought That keeps in peace the things of its own peace, Secret and surely; in faith, this frets my faith, Distunes me into discord with myself, That you should counsel me against my soul. I pray you do not. Rizzio. Nay, I will no more. But if you take not Murray again to trust At least in short sweet seeming for some while, So to subdue him as with his own right hand And all chief with him of his creed and crew, Then, cleaving to the old counsel, suddenly Have him attainted, and being so brought in By summons as your traitor, with good speed Have off his head; let him not live to turn; Choose you sure tongues to doom him, hands to rid, And be his slaying his sentence; for the rest, Make to you friends Argyle and Chatelherault And such more temperate of their faction found As may be servants to your pardoning hand If they be separable; but anywise In pardoning these forgive not half his fault With half their pardon; cut no branch of his But the root only; strike not but at heart When you strike him; he hath done and borne too much To live 'twixt that and this unreconciled, Having on this hand his conspiracy, On that your proclamation; his head priced, His life coursed after with hot hound and horn, His wife thrust forth hard on her travailing time With body soft from pangs and delicate To roam in winter-bound and roofless woods; These things not wholly with your grace wiped off And washed with favour and fair-faced love away Must work within him deadly and desperate. Queen. Now I find your counsel in you, no strange tongue But the old stout speech and sure; and this same day Will I set hand to it. I have chosen the lords That shall attaint in council these men fled Of mortal treason; and some two hours hence My tongue through their strange lips shall speak him dead Who is only my heart's hated among men. I am gay of heart, light as a spring south-wind, To feed my soul with his foretasted death. You know the reason I have, you know the right And he the danger of it, being no fool, For fool he is not; I would he were but fool. O, I feel dancing motions in my feet, And laughter moving merrily at my lips, Only to think him dead and hearsed, or hanged— That were the better. I could dance down his life, Sing my steps through, treading on his dead neck, For love of his dead body and cast-out soul. He shall talk of me to the worm of hell, Prate in death's ear and with a speechless tongue Of my dead doings in days gone out. Sweet lord, David, my good friend and my chancellor, I thank you for your counsel. Rizzio. May it be Prosperously mine! but howsoever, I think It were not well, when this man is put down, Though Lethington be wily or Melville wise, To make your stay of any other man. Queen. I would I had no state to need no stay; God witness me, I had rather be re-born And born a poor mean woman, and live low With harmless habit and poor purity Down to my dull death-day, a shepherd's wife, Than a queen clothed and crowned with force and fear. Rizzio. Are you so weary of crowns, and would not be Soon wearier waxen of sheepfolds? Queen. 'Faith, who knows? But I would not be weary, let that be Part of my wish. I could be glad and good Living so low, with little labours set And little sleeps and watches, night and day Falling and flowing as small waves in low sea From shine to shadow and back, and out and in Among the firths and reaches of low life: I would I were away and well. No more, For dear love talk no more of policy. Let France and faith and envy and England be, And kingdom go and people; I had rather rest Quiet for all my simple space of life, With few friends' loves closing my life-days in And few things known and grace of humble ways A loving little life of sweet small works. Good faith, I was not made for other life; Nay, do you think it? I will not hear thereof; Let me hear music rather, as simple a song, If you have any, as these low thoughts of mine, Some lowly and old-world song of quiet men. Rizzio. Then is the time for love-songs when the lip Has no more leave to counsel; even so be it; I will sing simply, and no more counsel you. Queen. Be not unfriends; I have made you wroth indeed, Unknowing, and pray you even for my no fault Forgive and give me music; I am athirst For sweet-tongued pardon only. Rizzio. If this be harsh, The pardon be for fault enforced of mine. Love with shut wings, a little ungrown love, A blind lost love, alit on my shut heart, As on an unblown rose an unfledged dove; Feeble the flight as yet, feeble the flower. And I said, show me if sleep or love thou art, Or death or sorrow or some obscurer power; Show me thyself, if thou be some such power, If thou be god or spirit, sorrow or love, That I may praise thee for the thing thou art. And saying, I felt my soul a sudden flower Full-fledged of petals, and thereon a dove Sitting full-feathered, singing at my heart. Yet the song's burden heavier on my heart Than a man's burden laid on a child's power. Surely most bitter of all sweet things thou art, And sweetest thou of all things bitter, love; And if a poppy or if a rose thy flower We know not, nor if thou be kite or dove. But nightingale is none nor any dove That sings so long nor is so hot of heart For love of sorrow or sorrow of any love; Nor all thy pain hath any or all thy power, Nor any knows thee if bird or god thou art, Or whether a thorn to think thee or whether a flower. But surely will I hold thee a glorious flower, And thy tongue surely sweeter than the dove, Muttering in mid leaves from a fervent heart Something divine of some exceeding love, If thou being god out of a great god's power Wilt make me also the glad thing thou art. Will no man's mercy show me where thou art, That I may bring thee of all my fruit and flower, That with loud lips and with a molten heart I may sing all thy praises, till the dove That I desire to have within my power Fly at thy bidding to my bosom, love? Clothed as with power of pinions, O my heart, Fly like a dove, and seek one sovereign flower, Whose thrall thou art, and sing for love of love. Queen. It sings too southerly for this harsh north; This were a song for summer-sleeping ears, One to move dancing measures in men's feet Red-shod with reek o'the vintage. Who went there? What, hear you not? Mary Seyton. My lord of Bothwell's foot: His tread rings iron, as to battle-ward. Queen. Not his, it was not. See if it be indeed. 'Twas a good song. Something he had with me— I thank you for your song—I know not what. Let him come in. Sir, be with us to-night— I knew it was late indeed—at supper-time. Rizzio. Madam, till night I take my loyal leave. God give you good of all things. [Exit. Queen. Doth he mock me? I care not neither; I know not. Stay with us. Enter Bothwell. Good morrow, sir: we bade you, did we not? Be with us after noon, 'tis not noon near, And you are truer than your own word; and that, 'Tis a true man's and trusty. Bothwell. True it should be, Madam, if truth be true, and I your thrall And truth's for your sake. Queen. I would know of you,— I know not what—something there was to know. I would you were not warden—as in truth I think to unmake you—of the marches there. 'Tis a fierce office. You have a royal sword, At least a knightly; I would not see it hacked rough In brawling border dangers. Bothwell. Anywhere Hand, hilt, and edge are yours, to turn and take, Use or throw by, you know it. Queen. I know it indeed. I have not many hearts with me, and hold Precious the hearts I have and the good hands. Ladies, we have somewhat with our servant here That needs no counsel and no ear of yours, So gives you leave. [Exeunt Maries. I know not why they are gone; I have nothing with you secret. Bothwell. Yea, one thing; You cannot help it; your face and speech and look Are secret with me in my secret heart. Queen. I know not that; I would I did know that. 'Tis yet not twelve days since I saw you wed To my dear friend, and with what eye you know Who would not, for all love that I might make And suit to you, give ear to me and be In mine own chapel at the holy mass Made one with her; for all the feast we kept, No jewel of mine bequeathed your wife might buy Consent of you to take her wedded hand After the church-rite of her faith and mine; And how much love went with your policy I cannot tell; yet was my will content That you should wed her name and house, to bring The race of Gordon on our side again, And have its ruin rebuilded and its might Restored to do us service; so you said, And so I thought I knew your mind to stand; Being so fast bound to me, I need not doubt She could but hold you by the hand, and I That had you by the heart need grudge not that, While time gave order, and expediency Required of us allowance; but in faith I know not whether there be faith or no Save in my heart wherein I know too sure How little wisdom is to trust in man. So comes it, as you see, for all my show, I am ill at heart and tired. Bothwell. 'Tis your own blame. Queen. Yea, now, what would you have me? I am yours to do it: But you say nothing; yet you say too much. My blame it is, my weary waste of breath, My wretched hours and empty bloodless life, My sleepy vigils and my starting sleeps, All by my fault—if it be fault to be More than all men loving, all women true, To hunger with the foodless heart of grief And wither with the tearless thirst of eyes, To wander in weak thought through unsown fields Past unreaped sheaves of vision; to be blind, Weak, sick and lame of spirit and poor of soul, And to live loveless for love's bitter sake And have to food loathing, and shame for drink, And see no cease or breach in my long life Where these might end or die; my fault it is, And I will kill my fault: for I that loved Will live to love no living thing again. Bothwell. As you will, then. Queen. Nay, do not tread on me; I am lying a worm out of your way, and you Turn back to bruise me. I am stricken sore enough. Do not worse wound me. I am hurt to the heart. You change and shift quicker than all good things, That all change quickly: I am fast, and cannot change. If you do hold me so, fast in your heart, You should not surely mock me. Bothwell. I mock you not. You are looser and lighter-tempered than the wind, And say I mock you: 'tis you mock yourself, And much more me that wot not of your mind, What would you have and would not. Queen. Nothing, I, Nothing but peace, and shall not. By my faith, I think no man ever loved woman well. You laugh and thrust your lips up, but 'tis truth, This that I think, not your light lewd man's thought, But in my meaning it is bitter true. By heaven, I have no heart for any on earth, Any man else, nor any matter of man's, But love of one man; nay, and never had. Bothwell. I do believe it, by myself I do, Who am even the self-same natured; so I know it. Queen. What heart have you to hurt me? I am no fool To hate you for your heat of natural heart. I know you have loved and love not all alike, But somewhat all; I hate you not for that. When have I made words of it? sought out times To wrangle with you? crossed you with myself? What have I said, what done, by saying or deed To vex you for my love's sake? and have been For my part faithful beyond reach of faith, Kingdomless queen and wife unhusbanded, Till in you reigning I might reign and rest. I have kept my body, yea from wedded bed, And kept mine hand, yea from my sceptre's weight, That you might have me and my kingdom whole; What have these done to take you, what to keep, Worth one day's doing of mine yet? Ah, you know, For all the shape and show of things without, For all the marriage and the bodily bond And fleshly figure of community, I have loved no man, man never hath had me whole, I am virgin toward you: O my love, love, love, This that is not yours in me I abhor, I pray God for your sake it may be false, Foolish and foul: I would not have it man, Not manlike, and not mine, it shall not be, Being none of love's, and rootless in my soul, Not growing of my spirit but my blood; I hate myself till it be born. Bothwell. Ay, sweet, You talk now loud of love, but ten days since Was I not bid love well your friend, and be True husband to her? what sweet-tongued preacher then Taught me how faith should best be kept by change Of passionate fear and pleasure and bright pain And all their strange sharp sweet solicitudes For such good gifts as wisdom gives and takes From hand to married hand of them that wed? Whose counsel was this wisdom? whose command This that set sorrow and silence as one seal On the shut lips of foolishness and love? Queen. I bade you not be wise; or if I bade, It was to be obeyed not. Bothwell. Then indeed I did obey not, who did foolishly To do your bidding. Queen. Mine? did I say, go? Did I say, love her? did I say, hate me? As you must hate to love her. Yea, perchance I said all this; I know not if I said; But all this have you done; I know that well. Bothwell. Indeed I have done all this if aught I have, And loved at all or loathed, save what mine eye Hath ever loathed or loved since first it saw That face which taught it faith and made it first Think scorn to turn and look on change, or see How hateful in my love's sight are their eyes That give love's light to others. Queen. Tell her so, Not me; I care not though you love your wife So well that all strange women's eyes and mine Are hateful to you. O, what heart have I, That jest and wrangle? but indeed I thought You should do well to love her not, but wed, And make you strong and get us friends—but, nay, God knows I know not what I thought, or why, When you should wed her: now I think but this, That if one love not she does well to die, And if one love she does not well to live. I pray you, go; not for my love who pray, But that for love's sake we thought well to part, And if we loved not it was well indeed. Go. Bothwell. To what end? and whither? whencesoe'er, I must come back. Queen. Not to my feet, not mine; Where should his end be for a married man To lie down lightly with all care cast off And sleep more sound than in love's lap? for sleep Between the two fair fiery breasts of love Will rest his head not oft, nor oft shut eyes, They say, that love's have looked on. Bothwell. By that law Mine eyes must wake for ever. Queen. Nay, for shame, Let not the fire in them that feeds on mine Strike fire upon my cheeks; turn off their heat, It takes my breath like flame and smothers me. What, when I bid? Bothwell. You have bid me do before What you have chid me doing, but never yet A thing so past all nature hard, nor now Shall chide me for obedience. Queen. Well—ah me!— I lack the heart to chide; I have borne too much And haply too much loved. Alas, and now I am fain too much to show it; but he that made Made me no liar, nor gave me craft with power To choose what I might hide at will or show. I am simple-souled and sudden in my speech, Too swift and hot of heart to guard my lips Or else lie lightly: wherefore while I may, Till my time come to speak of hate or love, I will be dumb, patient as pity's self Gazing from Godward down on things of the earth And dumb till the time be: would I were God, Time should be quicker to lend help and hand To men that wait on him. I will not wait, Lest I wait over long, no more than need, By my long love I will not. Were I a man, I had been by this a free man. Bothwell. Be content. If I have any wit of soldiership, 'Tis not far off from this to the iron day That sets on the edge of battle, the bare blow, All that we fight or fret for. 'Tis not like Men will bear long with their own lingering hopes And hearts immitigable and fiery fears That burn above dead ashes of things quenched Hotter for danger, and light men forth to fight, And from between the breaking ranks of war The flower must grow of all their fears and hopes, Hopes of high promise, fears made quick by faith, Angers, ambitions; which to gather and wear Must be our toil and garland. Queen. My heart's lord, I put my heart and hands into your hand To hold and help; do you what thing in the world Shall seem well to you with them, they content Live with your love or die. For my one part, I would I had done with need of forging words That I might keep truth pure upon my lips. I am weary of lying, and would not speak word more To mock my heart with and win faith from men But for the truth's sake of my love, which lies To save the true life in me. Bothwell. It may be You shall not long need to dress love in lies; This plighted plague of yours hath few men friends To put their bodies between death and his. Queen. Nay, I think not; and we shall shape us friends Out of the stuff of their close enmities Wherewith he walks enwoven and wound about To the edge and end of peril; yet God knows If I for all my cause would seek his death, Whose lips have stained me with report as foul As seem to mine their kisses that like brands Sear my shamed face with fire to think on them; Yet would I rather let him live, would God Without mine honour or my conscience hurt Divide from mine his star or bid it set And on my life lift up that light in heaven That is my day of the heart, my sun of soul, To shine till night shut up those loving eyes That death could turn not from it though the fire Were quenched at heart that fed them. Nay, no more: Let me go hence and weep not. [Exit. Bothwell. Fire, in faith, Enough to light him down the way of the worm And leave me warmer. She went suddenly; Doth she doubt yet? I think by God's light no— I hold her over fast by body and soul, Flesh holds not spirit closer. Now what way To shift him over the edge and end of life She laughs and talks of, yet keep fast my foot On the strait verge of smooth-worn stony things That we stand still or slide on? 'Tis a shoal Whereon the goodliest galleon of man's hope That had no burning beacon such as mine Lit of her love to steer by, could not choose But run to wreck. Re-enter Mary Beaton. Mary Beaton. Pray you, my lord, a word. If you know aught of any new thing here You will not be about the court to-night; If not, of my good will I counsel you, Make hence in speed and secret, and have hope Till the next day lighten your days to come. Bothwell. I had rather the close moon and stars anight Lit me to love-bed: what warm game is here That I must keep mine hand out? Mary Beaton. Such a game As you shall win and play not, or my wit Is fallen in sickness from me. Sir, you know I am your friend, I have your hap at heart, Glad of your good and in your crosses crossed; I pray you trust me, and be close and wise, For love of your own luck. Bothwell. Tell me one thing; What hand herein shall Master David hold? Mary Beaton. I think he will not hold the like alive. [Exeunt. Scene II. —The High Street. Burgesses and People. First Citizen. Was it not shown long since when she came in If God were glad of her? Two days and nights Ere she brought strife among us, and again Two nights and days when first we saw her face, We saw not once by day the sun's in heaven, The moon's by night, or any space of stars, But thick sick mist corrupting the moist air With drench of darkness, so that scarce at noon Might man spy man a bow-shot's length away; And in man's memory on that day of the year Was never a more dolorous face of heaven Seen so to scowl on summer, as to speak What comfort should come with her to this land; But then were most eyes blind. Second Citizen. These five years since Has God filled full of signs that they might see, And sent his plagues to open them; and most This year or twain what portents of his hand Have writ us down in heaven and trembling earth For fearful flatterers and for faithless friends Whose fear and friendship have no part in him, Who knows not or can read not? famine, frost, Storms of stars crossing, and strange fires in the air, Have these no tongues to chide with? Third Citizen. Why, at first A man that was no seer might see what end Should come on us that saw the mass come in And held our hand when man by man fell off And heart by heart was cooled of all its heat By sprinkled holy water of the court In five days' space, tempering the fervent edge That had been fieriest on God's side; Lord James, Whose heart should weep now for it, or burn again With shame to think how he made strong their hands Who have cast him out among the banished lords That lack their life in England, kept himself The chapel-door, that none who loved God's law Might slay the idolatrous and whorish priest In his mid sin; and after mass was said Lord Robert and Lord John of Coldingham, Who then had put not off our cause, but sat With faithful men as fellows at God's board, Conveyed him to his chamber: there began The curse that yet constrains us, and must fall On more than these; of whom ye know this John Is now before the face o'the fire of God, And ere he died in desperate penitence, Men say, sent warning to his sister queen To turn her feet from those unquiet ways Wherein they tread behind the Pope's to hell. First Citizen. His life was like his brother's of St. Cross, As foul as need or friar's or abbot's be That had no shameful part in a king's race, And made such end as he that lives may make, Whose bastard blood is proud yet, and insults As might a prince's or a priest's indeed, Being truly neither, yet with either name Signed as in scorn; these are our lords, whose lust Breaks down men's doors to fetch their daughters forth, Even as his townsmen vexed the doors of Lot Till God sent on them fire, who spares but these For our shame's sake, because we spare, being men, And let our hands hang swordless, and the wrath Faint in our hearts, that though God send none down Should be made fire to make a fire of them. Third Citizen. These fools and foul that with them draw the king To shame and riotous insolence which turns Past hope and love to loathing—these, though vile, Have in them less of poison than men's tongues Who for the queen's love boast in what brief while They will pluck down God and plant Antichrist, And pull out Knox by the ears: thus Bothwell did, And yet stands higher than any head save his Who in disdain of danger fills his hands As full of gold as are his faithless lips Of lies and bloody counsels, and requires No less than part in all their forfeit lands That live in exile, so to turn his name From loon to lord, from stranger into Scot, And next the Pope's exalt it: while this king Sets all his heart to fleshly foolishness, The beast-like body that eats up the soul, As a bird snared and eaten: and in fear Of God as Rimmon, with a supple soul, Crooks his lithe knee for craft and bows his back In either's house, yet seeks no prophet's leave, Nor hears his saying that God shall spew the like Out of his mouth. Second Citizen. Yet this good grows in him, That he has fallen in anger with the queen For her knave's sake that was his closest friend, Chief craftsman and main builder of the match; Yea, half his heart, brother and bedfellow, Sworn secret on his side. Third Citizen. There are who think They have changed beds in very and shameful deed, And halved more than their own hearts. First Citizen. He came here On the Pope's party, against our kindly lords, Against the duke, our first more natural head, Against the good will of all godliness; And hath he now cast their cords from him? nay, This is the stormy sickness of ill blood Swelling the veins of sin in violent youth That makes them wrangle, but at home and heart, Whatever strife there seem of hands abroad, They are single-minded in the hate of God. Did he not break forth into bitterness Being warned by Knox of youth and empty heart, Yea, rail aloud as one made mad with wine? Did he not lay devices with this knave That now ye say defiles him in his wife To rid the noble Murray from their way That they might ride with hotter spurs for hell? Second Citizen. God hath set strife betwixt them, that their feet Should not be long time out of their own snares. Here be the men we look for comfort from, Men that have God's mark sharp upon the soul; Stout Ochiltree, and our main stay John Knox. Enter John Knox and Ochiltree. Ochiltree. Have you yet hope that for his people's sake God will leave off to harden her hard heart, That you will yet plead with her? John Knox. Nay, I know not; But what I may by word or witness borne, That will I do, being bidden: yet indeed I think not to bring down her height of mind By counsel or admonishment. Her soul Is as a flame of fire, insatiable, And subtle as thin water; with her craft Is passion mingled so inseparably That each gets strength from other, her swift wit By passion being enkindled and made hot, And by her wit her keen and passionate heart So tempered that it burn itself not out, Consuming to no end. Never, I think, Hath God brought up against the people of God To try their force or feebleness of faith A foe than this more dangerous, nor of mood More resolute against him. Ochiltree. So long since You prophesied of her when new come in: What then avails it that you counsel her To be not this born danger that she is, But friends with God she hates and with his folk She would root out and ruin? John Knox. Yet this time I am not bidden of him to cast her off; I will speak once; for here even in our eyes His enemies grow great and cast off shame. We are haled up out of hell to heaven, and now They would fain pluck us backward by the skirt. And these men call me bitter-tongued and hard Who am not bitter; but their work and they Who gather garlands from the red pit-side To make foul fragrance in adulterous hair, And lift white hands to hide the fires of God, Their sweetness and their whiteness shall he turn Bitter and black. I have no hate of her, That I should spare; I will not spare to strive That the strong God may spare her, and not man. Ochiltree. Yea, both, so be we have our lost lords home, And the Pope's back-bowed changeling clean cast out And of a knave made carrion. John Knox. For your first, It grows as fruit out of your second wish; Come but the day that looks in his dead face, And these that hate him as he hates all good Shall have their friends home and their honour high Which the continuance of his life keeps low. Ochiltree. Surely, for that, my hand or any's else Were hot enough to help him to his end. Yet when this thing is through and this plague purged There stands a thorn yet in our way to prick— The loose weak-witted half-souled boy called king. John Knox. It is of him I am bidden speak with her, Having but now rebuked him backsliding In God's sight and his name. It may be yet, Whether by foolishness and envious heart Or by some nobler touch left in his blood, Some pulse of spirit that beats to a tune more high Than base men set their hearts by, he will turn Helpful to Godward, serviceable in soul To good men's ends in hate of that they hate: I cannot say; howbeit I fear not much Her love of him will keep him fast to her; If he be drawn in bonds after her wheels It will be but of subtle soul and craft The cords are woven that hold him. But, for me, Love they or hate, my way is clear with them; Not for her sake nor his sake shall our Lord Change counsel and turn backward; and save his What will or wit I have to speak or live He knows who made it little for myself, But for him great; and be you well assured Love of their love nor doubt of their dislike Hath upon me more power than upon God. For now I have seen him strive these divers years With spirits of men and minds exorbitant, Souls made as iron and their face as flame Full hard and hot against him, and their wits Most serpent-strong and swift, sudden of thought And overflowing of counsel, and their hands Full of their fortune, and their hearts made large To hold increase of all prosperities; And all these are not, and I poor man am, Because he hath taken and set me on his side And not where these were; I am content alone To keep mine own heart in his secret sight Naked and clean, well knowing that no man born Shall do me scathe but he hath bidden him do, Nor I speak word but as he hath set it me. First Burgess. Goes he to Holyrood? Second Burgess. Ay, sir, by noon. First Burgess. There is a kindling trouble in the air; The sun is halting toward the top of day; It will be shine or rain before he come. Ochiltree. What ails this folk to hover at our heel And hang their eyes on you so heedfully? John Knox. They should be naturally disquieted Seeing what new wind makes white the wave o'the time We ride on out of harbour. Sirs, ye have heard News of your scathe and of shame done to God, And the displeasure bites you by the heart, I doubt not, if your heart be godly given; Make your souls strong in patience; let your wrath Be rather as iron than as fuel in fire, Tempered and not consumed; heat that burns out Leaves the hearth chillier for the flameless ash Than ere the wood was kindled. First Burgess. Master Knox, You know us whereto we would and by what way; This too much patience burns our cheeks with shame That our hands are not redder than our face With slaying of manslayers who spill blood of faith And pierce the heart of naked holiness; It is far gone in rumour how the queen Will set on high and feed on gold that man Who was a scourge laid long since on the saints, The archbishop of St. Andrew's, and perforce, Dyed as he stands in grain with innocent blood, Will make him mightier for our scathe and shame Than ere the kindly people of the word Had made him bare of bad authority. Second Burgess. Likewise she hath given her seal imperial To a lewd man and a stranger, her own knave, Vile, and a papist; that with harp and song Makes her way smoother toward the pit of hell. John Knox. What needs us count and cast offences up That all we know of, how all these have one head, The hateful head of unstanched misbelief? For sins are sin-begotten, and their seed Bred of itself and singly procreative; Nor is God served with setting this to this For evil evidence of several shame, That one may say, Lo now, so many are they; But if one seeing with God-illumined eyes In his full face the encountering face of sin Smite once the one high-fronted head and slay, His will we call good service. For myself, If ye will make a counsellor of me, I bid you set your hearts against one thing To burn it up, and keep your hearts on fire, Not seeking here a sign and there a sign, Nor curious of all casual sufferances, But steadfast to the undoing of that thing done Whereof ye know the being, however it be, And all the doing abominable of God. Who questions with a snake if the snake sting? Who reasons of the lightning if it burn? While these things are, deadly will these things be; And so the curse that comes of cursed faith. First Burgess. It is well said. Second Burgess. Ay, and well done were well. Third Burgess. We have borne too long for God, we that are men, Who hath time to bear with evil if he would, Having for life's length even eternity; But we that have but half our life to live, Whose half of days is swallowed of their nights, We take on us this lame long-suffering, To sit more still and patienter than God, As though we had space to doubt in, and long time For temperate, quiet, and questionable pause. First Burgess. Let the time come. Second Burgess. Nay, we must make the time, Bid the day bring forth to us the fruit we would, Or else fare fruitless forth. Third Burgess. It is nigh noon; There will be shine and rain and shine ere night. Scene III. —Holyrood. The Queen and Rizzio; Mary Seyton and Mary Carmichael in attendance. Queen. Is he so tender-tongued? it is his fear That plucks the fang out from his hate, and makes A stingless snake of his malignant heart; He hath a mind, or had he a mind at all, Would have a mind to mischief; but his will Is a dumb devil. Rizzio. Why, fear then and no love Will make faith in him out of falsehood's self, And keep him constant through unstableness. Queen. Fear that makes faith may break faith; and a fool Is but in folly stable. I cannot tell If he indeed fear these men more than me; Or if he slip their collar, whether or no He will be firm on my side, as you say, Through very lightness; but I think not of him, Steadfast or slippery. Would I had been that day Handless, when I made one his hand with mine! Yet it seemed best. I am spirit-sick and faint With shame of his foul follies and loathed life, Which hath no part but lewdness of a man, Nor style of soulnor several quality, Dividing men from men, and man from beast, By working heart or complement of brain— None, very none. I will not see him to-night. I have given command to ensure our privacy. Is it past noon? Enter Darnley and Mary Beaton. Darnley. You say she hath asked for me? Mary Beaton. Ay, and complainingly, as though her love Were struck at by your absence. Darnley. Love! her love! It were a cunning stroke should print a wound In that which hath no substance, and no spirit To feel the hurt. Well, I will speak to her. Queen. How like a chidden bondman of his lord Looks my lord now! Come you from penance, sir? Has the kirk put you to no private shame Besides the public tongue of broad rebuke? We are blessed in your penitence; it is A gracious promise for you. Darnley. Penitence? Queen. You have a tender faith and quick remorse That will bear buffets easily; pray God It pluck you absolution from their hands Who are godly sparing of it. We have heard A priest of theirs cast for incontinence Hardly with thrice purgation of his shame Redeemed himself to kirkward. Darnley. I hear nought. Queen. Nay, but you hear when these rebuke you of sin In the full face and popular ear of men; You hear them surely, and patiently you hear, And it shows in you godliness and grace Praiseworthy from them; for myself, my lord, I have some foolish petulances in me And stings of pride that shut me out from grace So sought and bought of such men; but your course May teach me timelier humble-mindedness And patience to get favour: which till now I have never needed beg, and now should prove A very witless beggar. Teach me words, Pray you, to move men's minds with; such great men's As your submission purchases to be Good friends and patrons to you; for I fear Your Knox is not my friend yet. Darnley. So I think. Madam, I know not what you make of me, Nor if your jest be seasonable or no; I am no fool nor implement of theirs, Nor patienter of their irreverences Than the queen's self; if you endure such tongues, Why, I may bear them. Queen. Well and patiently; I praise your manhood's temper for it, and am The happier for your royalty of spirit That will not feel wrong done of baser men To be at all wrong done you. Darnley. Will you think it? Well then, I am so, I am just your thought, You read me right, and this our friend reads too, For I am plain and easy to read right. Queen. Have you made time to say so? Darnley. Ay, and this, That it mislikes me—it gives me discontent That men should— Queen. Ay? that men should—anything— Bear themselves manlike, or that men should be, It is offence done openly to you? Darnley. Nay, not offence, nor open; nought it is, Or to me nought. Queen. Nought as I think indeed. You were about to chide us? well it is You have so humble a wife of us and true, To make your chidings fruitful, that your words Bear and bring forth good seed of bettering change. I pray you, when you chide me, that you make Your stripes the gentler for my humbleness. Darnley. I have no mind to jest and jape, and will— And will not wrangle with you. Queen. Will, and will not? They say a woman's will is made like that, But your will yet is wilfuller than ours. Darnley. Not as I think. Queen. God better the king's thought,— And mind more tyrannous than is his place! Darnley. If I be king— Queen. And I be kingdomless, And place be no place, and distinction die Between the crown and curch—Well, on, our lord. Darnley. Why am I out of counsel with you? Whence Am I made show of for a titular fool And have no hand in enterprise of yours, Nor tongue, nor presence? Not alone my name That is rubbed out and grated off your gold, But myself plucked out of your register, Made light account of, held as nothingness, Might move me— Queen. Whither? Darnley. To some show of wrath More than complaint, if I were minded ill. Here is a breach made with the English queen, Our cousin of England, a wide-open breach, A great-grown quarrel, and I no part of it, Not named or known of. Queen. You are the happier man Heavenward, if blessed be the peaceable. Darnley. The happier heavenward, being the worldlier shamed; The less I like it. You have suddenly cast forth A man her servant and ambassador, With graceless haste and instance, from the realm, On barren charge of bare complicity With men now banished and in English bounds, But not attaint of treason toward us yet Nor deadly doomed of justice. Queen. Not attaint? Give not your spirit trouble for that; the act Is drawn by this against them, and the estates Need but give warrant to their forfeiture Now it has passed the lords of the articles; Take no care for it; though it be sweet in you And gracious, to show care of your worst foes You have on earth; that would have driven you forth A shameful rebel to your cousin queen And naked of our foreign favour here That clothed you with unnatural royalty And not your proper purple. Forth; you say I have done this wrong? Darnley. I do not say you have done Wise work nor unwise; but howbeit, I say I had no part in aught of it, nor knew With what a spur's prick you provoked her spleen Who is not stingless to requite it you, Nor with what scant of reason. Queen. 'Tis sad truth, She shows no less disquiet mind than yours Nor a less loud displeasure; she was kind, She says, well-willed to me-ward, but my sins, Unkindliness, and soul's obduracy, Have made her soft heart hard; and for this fault She will not ever counsel me again, Nor cease to comfort my dear brother's need With gold and good compassion: and I have Even such a sister as brother of her as him, And love alike and am like loved of them. He wills me well, she swears, as she herself, And, I'll re-swear it, she wills as well as he. Darnley. Ay, we know whence this well-spring of your will Takes head and current; who must have brave wars We know, fair field, broad booty to sweep up, Space to win spurs in; and what English gold Must after battle gild his heels with them, When he shall stand up in my father's stead Lieutenant-general for you of the realm: And who must have your brother's lands we know, Investiture must have, and chancellorship, And masterdom in council. Here he stands, A worthy witness to it; do you look on me? Is it not you must be the golden sir, The counsel-keeper, the sole tongue of the head, The general man, the goodly? Did you send Lord Bothwell hard at heel of him cast forth To make his wrong sweet with sweet-spoken words, And temper the sharp taste of outrage done And heat in him of anger, with false breath? Why made you not your own tongue tunable Who are native to soft speaking, and who hate With as good heart as any Scot that hates England? or is her messenger your fool To take blows from you and good words alike As it shall chance him cross your morning mood Angry or kindly? Queen. Sir, our chancellor, We charge you that you answer not the duke. Darnley. Duke? Queen. Ay, the duke of Rothsay; whom we pray Seek otherwhere some seemlier talking-stock To flush his hot and feverish wit upon. Darnley. Your chancellor? why went not such a man With you before the lords of the articles Now, an hour back, and yet but half day through, To help you speak the banished lords to death? Is't not the heart of the office, to see law Punish law's traitors, as you bid them be In the proof's teeth, who are honester than some You bid be law's justiciaries of them? Why went he not? 'twere no more shame nor praise Than here to swell in state beside your own. Queen. Must we crave leave to bid you twice take leave, Or twice to ask what would you? Darnley. Truly this, A mere mean thing, an insignificance, If you will once more hear—oh, nowise me, But just the man whose name you take in mouth To smite me on my face with—Master Knox. Queen. Are you his usher going before his grace No less than servant to his master-word? Or is it penitence and submission makes you In the holy way of honour and recompense So high in office with him? Say, this time For the usher's sake I'll speak with the usher's lord: Yet if I mind 'twas I bade send for him To speak of you his servant: for I hear You did not at first stripe submit yourself Nor take all penance with all patience, being Brought hardly in time to harsh humility Such as we see now; which thing craves excuse To make you gracious in your master's eyes, If it be true—I would not think it were— You brake in anger forth from the High Kirk, Being there rebuked, and would not sit at meat, But past away to hawking in pure rage After an hour or twain of high discourse Heard with plain show of sharp unthankfulness; Which that you now repent and would redeem I will bear witness for you to your lord To make your penitential peace with him. Let him come in. Darnley. I am no messenger. Queen. Where is my chamberlain? bid Marnock here— Let the man in and one man only more, Whoever it be; we'll see him privily. Our chancellor, and our no messenger, We have no need of to dispute with him. Darnley. If I go hence— Queen. Why then you stay not here. Darnley. But if I go at bidding— Queen. Why, you go: With the more speed, the less of tarriance made. Let me not hold you half-way back: farewell. [Exeunt Darnley and Rizzio. I have not begun so luckily, nor set So good a face on the first half of day, Now to keep terms with mere tongue-traitors more. Enter John Knox and John Erskine of Dun. So once we are met again, sir, you and I. Set him before us. John Knox. I am before your grace Without man's haling or compulsive word: Nor at these divers times you have sent for me Have you found need to use me forcefully. Queen. Well, let that be; as verily meseems 'Tis I find forceful usage at your hands, And handling such as never prince has borne Since first kings were; yet have I borne with it, Who am your natural princess, and sat by To hear your rigorous manner of speaking through As loud against my kinsfolk as myself; Yea, I have sought your favour diligently And friendship of my natural subject born And reconcilement by all possible means; I have offered you at your own choice and time Whenso it pleased you ever admonish me Presence and audience; yea, have shamed myself With reasonless submission; have endured The naked edge of your sharp speech, and yet Cannot be quit of you: but here to God I make my vow I will be once revenged. Give me my handkerchief. I should take shame That he can shame me with these tears, to make Mine eyes his vassals. John Knox. Madam, true it is There have been divers seasons of dispute Between your grace and me, wherein I have never Found you offended: neither now would find The offence I sought not; yea, I knew this well, If it shall please God break your prison-house And lighten on your disimprisoned soul, That my tongue's freedom shall offend you not. For surely being outside the preaching-place I think myself no breeder of offence Nor one that gives man cause of wrath and wrong; And being therein, I speak not of myself But as God bids who bids me, speaking plain, Flatter no flesh on earth. Lo, here I stand, A single soul and naked in his eye, Constrained of him, to do what thing he will, And dare and can none other. Hath he sent me To speak soft words of acceptable things In ladies' chambers or kings' courts, to make Their ways seem gracious to them? I wot, no. I am to bring God's gospel in men's ears, And faith therein, and penitence, which are The twain parts of it; but the chief o'the land And all the main of your nobility Give God no heed nor them that speak for God Through flattering fear and ill respect of you; And seeing if one preach penitence to men He must needs note the sin he bids repent, How should not I note these men's sin who choose To serve affections in you and wild will Rather than truth in God? This were lost breath, To chide the general wrong-doing of the world And not the very present sin that burns Here in our eyes offensive; bid serve God, And say not with what service. Queen. Nay, but so What is it to you or any saving me How this man married to me bears himself? With what sign-manual has God warranted Your inquisition of us? What am I That my most secret sanctuaries of life And private passages of hours should be Food for men's eyes or pavement for men's feet To peer and pasture, track and tread upon, Insult with instance? Am I only bound To let the common mouth communicate In my life's sweet or bitter sacrament, The wine poured, the bread broken every day? To walk before men bare that they may judge If I were born with any spot or no, And praise my naked nature? to subject Mine unsubmitted soul subordinate To popular sight and sentence? What am I That I should be alone debarred, deposed, From the poor right of poor men, who may live Some hour or twain unchallenged of the day And make to no man answer what they do As I to mine must render? who is this That takes in hand such hard things and such high? Sir, what man are you that I need account For this word said or that, or such things done, Only to you or mainly, of myself? Yea, what are you within this commonwealth? John Knox. A man within it and a subject born, Madam; and howsoever no great man, Earl, lord, nor baron to bear rule therein, Yet has God made me a profitable man, How abject I seem ever in your eye, No member of the same unmeritable. Yea, madam, this pertains not less to me Than any of all your noble-nurtured men, To warn men of what things may hurt the same, So as I see them dangerous: and herein My conscience and mine office with one tongue Crave plainness of me: wherefore to yourself I say the thing I speak in public place, That what great men soever at any time Shall be consenting to your lord's unfaith Or flattering furtherance of unfaith in you, They do what in them lieth to cast out Christ, Banish his truth, betray his liberty And free right of this realm, and in the end Shall haply do small comfort to yourself. And for him too, your husband, it may be That as he spares not to dishonour God For your delight, by service of the mass, God will not spare to smite him by your hand That faithlessly he fawns on to his loss. Queen. When was there queen so handled in the world? I would I could not weep; for being thus used I needs must never or now. Is this light day? Am I asleep, or mad, or in a trance, That have such words to beat about mine ears And in mine eyes his present face who speaks? Erskine of Dun. Madam, I pray your grace contain your mood, And keep your noble temperance of yourself, For your high sake and honour, who are held For excellence of spirit and natural soul As sovereign born as for your face and place, Kingdom and kingly beauty; to whose might The worthiest of the world, all Europe's chief, Her choice of crowns, might gladly bow themselves To find your favour. I beseech you think That here is no disloyalty designed Nor thing dishonourable; for were men mad Whose wits are whole, and false whose faiths are sound, The very mouth of madness would speak sense, The very tongue of treason would speak truth, For love and service of your royalty; Blind curses bless, and red rebellion bow, That came to burn and threaten. Do not dream That a man faithful Godward and well loved Can be to youward evil-willed, who have Power on your natural and your born unfriends To bind their good-will to you. Queen. Words, all words; I am weary of words: I have heard words enough To build and break, if breath could break or build, Centuries of men. What would they with me, sir? These my liege folk that love me to the death, Their death or mine, no matter—my fast friends Whose comfortable balms so bruise my head It cannot hold the crown up—these good hands That wring my wrist round to wrench out the staff God set into mine own—these loving lips That take my name upon them as to kiss And leave it rank with foam of hateful speech? Must I be dead deposed, or must I live Stript shameless, naked to the very name, A crestless creature and displumed, that feeds On charities and chances? will they give Me, their queen born, me, bread or dust to eat, With a mouth water-moistened or a dry, Beggared or buried? shall I hold my head In shameful fief and tenantry of these For their least wind of any wrath that blows To storm it off my shoulders? What were I That being so born should be born such a thing As bondsmen might bemock the bondage of And slaves contemn for slavery? Nay, no words: A word may wound and no word heal again, As none can me—whom all men's words may wound— Who am liable to all buffets of men's tongues, All stripes of all their scandals—and was born To no such fear—and have nor tongue nor wit To plead and gather favour—no such grace As may get grace, no piteous skilfulness— Only my truth and tears—and would to God My tears and truth for you were wind and fire To burn and blow corruption from the world, And leave pure peace to breed where you plant war And make the furrows fat with pestilence And the grain swell with treason—but, too sure, They too can hurt and heal not. I am soul-sick With shame and bitter weakness; yet, God's will, I may take strength about me to put off Some part of shame. Sir, you that make me weep, By these my tears and my sharp shame of them I swear you will not laugh to see me laugh, When my time comes: you shall not; I will have Time to my friend yet—I shall see you, sir, If you can weep or no, that with dry eyes Have seen mine wet—I will try that—look to it. John Knox. Madam, I speak in very eye of God, I never took delight in any tears Shed of God's creatures; yea, for my self-sake, I can but very hardly abide the tears Of mine own boys whom mine own hand and love Chastens, and much less can take any joy In this the weeping of your majesty. But seeing I have given you no offensive cause Nor just occasion, but have spoken truth After mine office as mine own place craves Lest I, God's man, be mansworn to God's truth, I must sustain, howbeit unwillingly, Rather these tears drawn of your majesty Than blood of mine own conscience stabbed to death Or through my silence of my commonwealth By my dumb treason wounded. Queen. A fair word— I thought it was forgotten of men's mouths And only lived in the inner heat of the heart Too sure to want the spelling of their speech. Sir, you shall find it in my very tears, This blood you fear for of your commonwealth, And in the hurts of mine authority The wounds it lies abed with; what, God help, Can the head bleed and not the body faint? Or wherein should the kingdom feel such maim As in the kingship stricken? there are you, If you be true man, and each true man born Subject and circled with the bound of rule, Hurt to the heart. But heartless things are words; Henceforth I will not mix my speech with yours In the way of disputation ever more, Nor set against your tongue the plea of mine To reason as its equal. Wait you here, Here in the chamber: you, sir, come with me To counsel in my cabinet somewhile; We will return his answer. [Exeunt Queen and Erskine of Dun. Mary Carmichael. She wept sore; I never saw her spirit, so chafed, so melt And thaw to such mere passion; this one time He is sure attainted. Mary Beaton. Ay, she fain would dare Upon the spur of the hour attaint him; yet What none dare else she durst not; they will put Force of fair words as bridle in the mouth Of her wild will and reinless. Mary Seyton. She is wise, And fights not wisdom, but being counselled well Takes truce with time and tongueless policy. What, will the man speak to us? he looks so hard With such fast eyes and sad—I had not thought His face so great, nor presence. John Knox. Ah, fair ladies, How fair were this your life and pleasurable If this might ever abide, and so in the end With all this gay gear we might pass to heaven: But fie upon that knave, Death, that will come Whether we will or will not: and being come, When he has laid on his assured arrest, The foul worms will be busy with this flesh, Be it never so fair and tender; and the soul, The silly soul shall be so feeble, I fear, It can bear with it neither gold nor pearl, Painting of face, garnish, nor precious stones. Mary Beaton. Sir, for myself, small joy this were to me That this life should live ever: nor would I Care much by praying to stretch my days of life Into more length, nor much to take with me Garnish or gold; but one thing I would fain Have to go gravewards with me and keep it safe, That you have cast no word or warning on, And yet women, whose hearts are worldly worn And by no creed of yours consolable Nor gladness of your gospel, love its name As dear as God's; and its name is but rest. John Knox. Rest has no other name but only God's. Mary Beaton. But God has many another name than rest: His name is life, and life's is weariness. John Knox. Ay, but not his; that life has lost his name; Peace is his name, and justice. Mary Beaton. Ah, sir, see, Can these two names be one name? or on earth Can two keep house together that have name Justice and peace? where is that man i'the world Who hath found peace in the arms of justice lain Or justice at the breast of peace asleep? Is not God's justice painted like as ours, A strong man armed, a swordsman red as fire, Whose hands are hard, and his feet washed in blood? It were an iron peace should sleep with him, And rest were unrest that should kiss his lips. What man would look on justice here and live, Peace has no more part in him. John Knox. Lady, nay, That only peace indeed which is of God Hath in the just man not a part but all, But the whole righteous life and heart in him Still peacefully possesses; who hath not Or loves not justice, he can love not peace, For peace is just; and that thing is not peace That such men love, but full of strife and lies, A thing of thorns and treasons. This were even As if a man loving a harlot should Praise her for maiden and himself for pure To love such maidenhood, when any says That he loves peace who loves not holiness, For peace is holy. Yea, and if one seek He shall find peace where bitterest justice is, In the full fire and middle might of wrath, Rather than where sloth sucks the lips of shame Or fear with her foul brother unbelief Lives in adultery; strife is that which springs, As a winged worm and poisonous, of their sheets; And in the slumberless and storm-strewn bed That very war's self spreads for righteousness Peace as a babe is born. Mary Beaton. Would God it were, For 'tis a bitter childbed: these long years We look for fruit and none comes forth of it, But yet more iron travail; and ourselves Desiring justice quite lose hold of peace And are distracted with our own fierce want And hungry need of right unreachable. Yet it may come, and then shall peace indeed. John Knox. You talk against your habit. Re-enter Erskine of Dun. Erskine of Dun. Master Knox, The queen will no more hear you at this time, But with good will and gracious mind will weigh Your worth and worthy meaning in your words. John Knox. It may be she will never hear me more. Farewell, fair ladies; may God look on you, And give you chiefly comfort, which is grace. [Exeunt John Knox and Erskine of Dun. Mary Seyton. Why did you prate so preacher-like with him? Mary Beaton. I cannot tell by asking of myself Nor answer for your asking. Which of you Shall wait at supper on the queen to night? Mary Carmichael. None but her counsel of close hours, Argyle. Mary Beaton. She sups with them—and in attendance there Some two or three I heard of—one of these No man of arms. Mary Seyton. What should they do with arms? More need of lips to sing with. Mary Beaton. Ay, to sing— It is no matter of state they meet upon? Mary Seyton. Are your wits lost indeed, or do you jest? Mary Beaton. True, it should be for no affairs of state They sup at nightfall in the lesser room— They three, and three to make the music up. Mary Seyton. What ails you at it? Mary Beaton. Nothing; I ail nought. I did but think what music he should make After this preacher. Let us to the queen. Scene IV. —Darnley's Lodging. Darnley and Sir George Douglas. Darnley. I think our friend of Morton had grown slack But for my spurring, uncle. Sir George Douglas. Nay, he is firm; You do him less right than you do yourself To think he should need quickening. Darnley. O, I know not, What should I know? what wit have I to know? I am a fool and have no forethought! Why, But for my resolute instance at this need— I said to him, be resolute—and since then, Some six or eight hours gone, I have heard such things As would put sense and passion in dead bones— By God I have; it shall be seen I have. But are you sure it should be done to-night? Sir George Douglas. Ay, surely. Darnley. Well, I see no surety in it— Methinks now every day we let him live Blows hot the popular wrath of all the land And makes us surer when we strike indeed That all men's hearts will stab him with our hands. Sir George Douglas. By which account he might live long and die An old white death and woundless. Is not this The man whereof you told me some while since How at close midnight, your wife's doors being locked, You burst them open, and gat hold of him Hid in a closet of her bedchamber, Save for furred gown and shirt about the knave Naked? and must you take him so again And he so twice get clear of you and laugh? You swore me that—what need to tell or swear, If he must live still? weeping, with clenched hands, You swore it, praying me for our shame's sake send Word to your uncle Ruthven; but what need, If there were no shame in the thing at all Or but so little, as now so little it seems, There is no haste to slay him? Darnley. Nay, you carp— 'Tis thus men ever catch at my good words To turn them on their tongues and spit them out Changed and discoloured. He shall die to-night. Sir George Douglas. Assuredly. Darnley. I say so—mark, I say it, I that have cause—how else could it be sure? But sure it is—I say he shall not live. Let us go seek Lord Morton out again And tell him it is sworn we strike to-night. How many of us have hands in it with me, Who cannot with mine own hand as I would Strike—it were shameful to me—were it not? For mine own hand's sake. Sir George Douglas. There are hands enough Without the shame done to your highness' hand: Sufficeth us we have it set to the bond That signs him dead; nor need we sum their names Whose hands will strike, not spare, for their own sakes. Darnley. Well, let us go to make my lord's faith sure That it shall be no later than to-night. Scene V. —The Queen's Cabinet. The Queen, Rizzio, Countess of Argyle, Lord Robert Stuart, Arthur Erskine, in attendance. Queen. Have I not done a queenlike work to-day? I have made attaint my traitors of myself, With no man at my hand to strengthen me Have gone before the lords of the articles And set my will upon them like a seal, And they for their part set on their old friends The bloody seal of treason signed of death And countersigned of burning ignominy. You were half fearful, you, lord chancellor, You my good servant; but I knew their necks Were made to take the impression of my foot, Their wills and souls the likeness of mine own, And I have used them for the things they are. Countess of Argyle. You have been right royal, madam, and your lovers Have joyful cause to praise you. Queen. Will you say it, Who bear as much part in his blood as I Of our dead father's giving? then I think No other tongue for love of Murray slain Shall sting me though mine own speak off his head, Once caught up out of England; nay, I think We shall get vantage of your lord's friend Knox Ere many days be. Countess of Argyle. Speed your majesty! The cord were hallowed that should silence him. Queen. Ay, though mine own hands twist it. To spin hemp For such a throat, so loud and eloquent, Should better please me and seem a queenlier thing Than to weave silk and flower it with fine gold. He hath a tongue to tame a tiger with, Fright into fierce and violent reverence The fearfullest earth's monsters. I do think I like him better than his creed-fellows Whose lips are softer toward me; 'tis some sport To set my wit to his, and match with mine The shrewd and fiery temper of his spirit For trial of true mastery; yet to-day He made me weep, weep mightily—by faith, If there be faith in any lips of earth, I think to live and laugh at his tears yet. Robert Stuart. I would the hand were on him that might make His eyes weep red and drop out of their rings, Looking on death. What reason gives him leave, What right makes room for him to take his way So past men's patience grown so masterful? Had I one half word's warrant of your grace His tongue should not be long inside his lips. Queen. I am no wife of Antony, to try My needle's point against his tongue's edge; yet I have cause as good as Fulvia's, though his speech Ring somewhat short of Roman. Here is one That has that southern honey on his lips Frozen as it seems up with this galling air And not a note left golden, but his tongue Nipt with the chill to death as with a knife That cuts us short of music. Countess of Argyle. Yea, my lord, Why will you so discomfort the good hour With tongueless sadness? we have cause to chide That having cause to sing find song to seek And thought to find it ready. Rizzio. I have been sad These two hours back; I know not what it was So struck me out of mirth, for I was merry, And knew not why. Queen. Nay, if you love me, sir, You had reason to be merry with my mirth Who am blithe to be found queen over my foes; I have been glad all this good day thereof Save some few minutes that my subject-saint Vexed even to mere intemperance; but few tears Wept out that little bitter part of day And left it sweet. Have you not heard men say This heaviness without a root of fear Goes oft before some good? now should there be Some new thing hard upon us that will make All good hearts glad. Have you no song to mock The doubt away that mocks you? Rizzio. At your will. I am something yet in tune for such a song As joy makes out of sorrow, when the thought Plays with false grief for joy's sake. Please you hear it With such light audience as its worth is light? Queen. Ay, such a note should fit me for this time: After the tuneless toil of talking day A light song lightly brings ill thoughts asleep. (Rizzio sings). Lord Love went Maying Where Time was playing, In light hands weighing Light hearts with sad; Crowned king with peasant, Pale past with present, Harsh hours with pleasant, Good hopes with bad; Nor dreamed how fleeter Than Time's swift metre, O'er all things sweeter How clothed with power, The murderess maiden Mistrust walks laden With red fruit ruined and dead white flower. How close behind him Ere man's faith find him, How strong to bind him With fears for bands, Lest once beholden Of man the golden God's face embolden All hearts and hands; For if doubt were not, Whose sore shafts spare not, Large life would care not For death's poor hour, Seeing all life's season By love's sweet reason Made wise would seem in his eyes a flower. Countess of Argyle. Did you hear that? Robert Stuart. What? Queen. Nothing but sweet words. Countess of Argyle. I heard a cry i'the wind as of one hurt. Arthur Erskine. There is no wind up, madam. Queen. Peace, I pray; It was your own sense mocked you. Hear it through; There should be more, and sadder. Countess of Argyle. Nay, I heard. Rizzio (sings). By Love's side flying As Time went crying Glad news and lying In all men's ears, With blind feet gliding She came deriding Their joyous tiding That ends in tears; From Time's side failing As Love sank quailing, Her strong wings sailing Made all heads cower, Her wings untethered, With fleet thoughts feathered, Made weak the summer and bleak the flower. Hope found no cover Wherein to hover, And Love no lover, And Joy no place; Till when Time creeping Had left him sleeping, Love knelt down weeping Before her face, And prayed, soul-stricken, One flower might quicken, Though spring should sicken And storm devour; She from her bosom Flung one sere blossom, Then passed him dead on the last dead flower. Robert Stuart. Hark! some one laughed there. Queen. What does death i'the song? Can they not let love live, but must needs make His grave with singing? 'Tis the trick of song That finds no way to end else. Rizzio. An old trick; Your merrier songs are mournfuller sometimes Than very tears are. Queen. Do you hear noises still? Enter Darnley. Who sent you to us? Darnley. My love to my sweet lady. [Kisses her. Queen. What feet are theirs behind you? Who stands there? Darnley. Nay, nothing, nay, sweet, nothing. Queen. I should know— Judas! [Seeing Ruthven in the doorway. Darnley. I tell you— Ruthven. Let that man come forth; He hath been here too long. Queen. What hath he done? Ruthven. So please your highness, how he hath done you wrong To offend the honour of your majesty I dare not boldly say; but this I dare, He hath done the king your husband's honour wrong In this past all the rest, to hinder him Of the crown matrimonial, which your grace Made his by promise; other wrongs than this Are more than I need speak of; for the lords, He hath caused you banish a great part of them And the most chief, and at this parliament Forefault them as for treason, that himself Who jets here in his cap and damask gown Might of your grace be made a lord, and tread On men more noble: wherefore with good cause For very love I pray your majesty Make not yourself his buckler who lacks heart Save to pluck forth his hanger and not strike, But cower behind and clasp your gown for shield. Stand from before the window, lest perforce I hale him hence by the hair. Queen. Help us, our friends! Thrust out this death-faced traitor. Arthur Erskine. Sir, give way. Robert Stuart. Out of this presence! Ruthven. Lay no hands on me; [Draws. Stand; I will not be handled. Enter Fauldonside and Sir George Douglas. Queen. Out with him! Rizzio. Save, save me, madam! Queen. You are within my ward. Stand from him, sirs; what! treason! Fauldonside. Nay, then, thus. [Putting a pistol to her breast. Queen. Do him no wrong; ye dare not murder me: If he have sinned let justice pass on him. Fauldonside. This cord shall justify him. Rizzio. Help me! help! Sir George Douglas. Let go the queen. Rizzio. Help me, my mistress! Fauldonside. Out! Queen. Have mercy! Rizzio. Mercy! nay, I am innocent! Save me, sweet lady! Queen. Will ye slay me too? Fauldonside. Drag him away; pluck his hands off her. Rizzio. Help! [They force him out. Queen. Why does that sheath sit empty on your side? Where is the dagger? Darnley. Why, I know not where. Queen. It will be known hereafter; it shall be Dear blood to some of you if David's here Be spilt, my faithful servant's; but may God, My poor true friend, have mercy on your soul! Ruthven. Here, take your wife into your arms, my lord, And bid her fear not. Madam, have no fear; We had sooner spend the blood of our own hearts Than you should suffer harm; and what we do Is but your husband's bidding. Let them pass: He shall be kept for this time safe enough In my lord's chamber here. Darnley. Ay shall he, safe— In that same chamber where you used of old Before this fellow grew so in your grace To come and seek me; but since he so fell In credit with you and familiar use, Even if I come to yours I find of late Small entertainment of you, save so far As David may sit third with us, and set To cards with you even till an hour or twain Be gone past midnight. Queen. I have heard not said It was a duteous gentlewoman's part To seek her husband's chamber, but the man's To seek the wife when he would aught with her. Darnley. Why came you to my chamber then at first, And ever till these few months back that he Became familiar with you? or am I In any part now of my body failed, To fall out of your grace? or what disdain Have you of me? or what offence of mine Makes you not use me at all times alike, Seeing I am willing to do all good things That may become a husband to his wife? Queen. My lord, of all the shame here done to me You have the fault: for which sake I henceforth Shall never be your wife nor lie with you, Nor ever shall have liking of my life Till I may make you bear as sore a heart As I bear now. Ruthven. Madam, for honour's sake, Be reasonably and timely reconciled To your wed lord; and with him take advice Of such good friends as love you. Give me leave: I am faint, and cannot stand to plead with you. [Sits. Bring me to drink, for God's sake. Darnley. Give my lord A cup of wine. Queen. Is this your malady? If ye shall slay me or my six months' child By this night's force and fear, my friends yet live To wreak me of Lord Ruthven. Ruthven. Be content. Queen. When word goes forth how I am handled here— What, am I kinless, think you, without help? Mine uncles and my brother king of France, All lords of all lands living, all heads crowned, Shall be one storm to shake you from the world; And the Pope with me, and the Catholic king, And all that live or of my faith or blood, Shall all make way upon you. Ruthven. I am too mean That these so many and mighty should take aim At one such poor man here as I am. See, If you will weigh it worthily yourself, This is no treason; never till this night Was so good service done you. For myself, I will make answer to God's charge and man's How I have served you in it. Queen. What have I done? What thing am I that ye should use me thus? O miserable and desertless that I am, Unkingdomed of mine honour! I that had Lordship of land and natural rule of men Am poorer here than any landless man And weaker than all women. Pray you, sir, By what law's sentence am I made man's thrall? What lord have I offended that can bid My face for shame be covered in your sight? Whom have I wronged? or who hath power on me, What thing soever I be, to do me wrong? Who hath given forth judgment on me? what man's right Calls me his servant? Nay, there is no slave Men strike without a sentence; and ye strike Your own right in me and your name to death With one self-ruinous violence. Ruthven. Be at peace; We strike but your own sickness off yourself Who cut off him to save you: the disease That dies of the physician leaves no cause That you should curse but thank him. Queen. Thank? ay, thank— God give me grace to give you thanks! be sure Ye shall not lack my memory to it, nor will To make me worthy of you. What, no more? [Exit Ruthven. I thought his wrath was large enough for me To find a murderous part in where to die And share it with my servant. Must I live? Sir, you that make death warm between your lips, And, silent, let fall murder from your mouth, Have you no kiss to kill me? no love left To give me poison? Why is he gone forth? Hath the hot falsehood eaten through your tongue? Speak. Darnley. Why, I bade him look to those your friends That might have risen upon us; hear you that? [Noise outside. There is a clamour of them in the courts, But nought to help or hurt now. He is gone To read our will out in the general ear, And by proclaiming of my share with them In this their new-born justice to make sure Men's hearts that hearken; and lest fear shake our friends, Or ill will toward us and good will toward you Make our foes strong in malice of design, To warn them of your brother's present speed, Who must be here with morning: my device, My trick to win all faiths that hang on him And tie them to my service with his hand. So have we all souls instant on our side, And you no way to wound us: for by this, Even with the hearing of my name given forth As parcel of the bond that writes him dead, Which is now cancelled with his blood-shedding, This your good town is with us, and your lords That stood for you with this man fled or dead, If they dare strike or stand yet. What shift now? What wit? what craft? Queen. My friends driven forth the court? No help upon my side? The town raised too? Darnley. We had no heart nor wit to work with, ha? We were your fools, and heartless? Queen (at the window). Help, all friends! All good men help your queen here! Ho, my lord, My lord the Provost! Darnley. He is raised indeed. Queen. Help for the queen! help, Provost! Darnley. Peace, I say; You may fare worse: these are wild hours. Voice without. Sit down; You shall be hewn in pieces if you stir And flung into the Nor-loch. Darnley. Nay, be wise; Pluck not their madness on you. Queen. O, your love! It shows now kindly in you. Re-enter Ruthven. Ruthven. All is sped; The lords of the adverse party being roused up And hearing with what large applause of men The reading of our sentence in the bond And names subscribed, and proclamation made Of Murray even at heel of the act returned, Was of all mouths made welcome, in fierce haste Forth of their lodging fled confusedly With no more tarriance than to bring their lives Clear of the press and cry of peril at hand, And their folk round them in a beaten rank Hurled all together; so no man being left, The earls of Huntley and of Bothwell gone, To lift a hand against the general peace, The townsmen, of their surety satisfied, Brake up with acclamation of content For the good comfort done them in this deed. Queen. What have ye made my servant? Ruthven. A dead dog. His turn is done of service. Darnley. Yea, stark dead? Ruthven. They stabbed him through and through with edge on edge Till all their points met in him; there he lies, Cast forth in the outer lodge, a piteous knave And poor enough to look on. Queen. I am content. Now must I study how to be revenged. Darnley. Nay, think not that way: make it not so much; Be warned, and wiser. Queen. Must I not, my lord? You have taught me worthier wisdom than of words; And I will lay it up against my heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. BOTHWELL. Time, from March 10, 1566, to February 9, 1567. Scene I. —The Queen's Chamber. Enter Darnley and Arthur Erskine, severally. Darnley. Is the queen risen? Arthur Erskine. She has not slept, my lord. They say she is in some peril of mishap Through the sore handling of this violent night; Mortal mishap it may be. Darnley. Ay! who say it? What should be mortal to her? she was not sick Nor near enough her danger. Arthur Erskine. I am no leech; Haply the fright of murderous menaces And noise of swords is held medicinal; The savour of a slain friend comfortable And his blood balm: if these be healthful things, You have given her weakness physic. Enter the Queen. Queen. Ah, our lord! Comes he with death about him? I could take it As readily as condemned men take reprieve, For of a life much deadlier than itself Death would reprieve me. Darnley. I am come to bring you help. Queen. You are ever helpful, even at all needs good, For stroke or speech, good always. I am weak; Let me have execution swift or soft; Here is no strength to suffer. Darnley. Sit, and rest. Queen. Nay, I can stand; or should I kneel, my plight Were one with my new fortune. You may go: I have but private penitence to do, And privy grace to get me; for indeed I were stark mad to hope by any mean For public pardon; I am condemned, and have No hope but of such pity as dead men gain Who living found no grace in the great world. [Exit Arthur Erskine. Now, what death, sir? Darnley. You think not as you speak; Your thought has other business than your tongue, And death has no part in it. Queen. I am assured I must not live. Darnley. Whose doom has passed on you? Not mine; I would not have you go in fear; You may be safe as I am. Queen. As you, my lord? I think I may, and yet may chance but find A little day of surety. Darnley. By mine honour, My word and place of sovereignty is pledged For your fair usage; they that unseat you Shall find no king in me. Queen. Nay, I think not. Darnley. As they would have me friend and firm to them, I told them, they should use you royally, No state or privilege plucked off you; nay, I have no thought by stolen strength of yours To increase myself out of your weakness; only I would have royalty re-made in you, And in your honour an honourable part; See the state in you and the name shine fair, And in your praise mine own praise perfected As parcel of it, and in your good fame Mine own fame stablished; as from your repute Shaken or sullied, my name too takes soil, And in your insufficience I wax weak, So would I have the grace I gain and strength Redound to youward; who being queen indeed, I cannot seem unkingly. Queen. 'Tis well thought. It was my curse to know not in good time How high a sense and royal of itself I had in you so near me. Darnley. That your thought, Misdeeming me worth no more weight with you, Hath brought us to this breach. Now lies it in you To make all whole; these lords that in my name And for mine ends and with my leave rose up To rid out peril and scandal from us all, And make red-handed witness of themselves Against the shame and scathe of royalty, Are not the traitors of your thought, but keep Faith flawless toward the personal empire here And spirit of rule, dishonouring not the law By forceful chastisement of secret breach That did it bloodless violence; this blood shed Must heal indeed the privy hurt of law And all but death of kingship, in such pass Wasted and wounded; but no hand of theirs Would stab through you your holy majesty, Cut off all life of law with yours, and make Authority die with you one visible death; No thought put out your office, though yourself Were found come short thereof, to leave this land A kingless kingdom; wherefore with good will I counsel you make peace with their designs And friends with mine intent, which for us both Is but all power and honour. Queen. So you see it; But were your eyes no flatterers of themselves The sight were other: yet for my poor part I cannot care though power be out of sight, Save that mine honour visibly is marred By wreck in you of either; for indeed Nor power nor honour shall hang on to you If you must wear them but at will of men And by strange leave of chance authority Reign or not reign; but all concerns me not; Rule as you may, be lord of that you can, I can contend not with your lords or you, Their master-servant. Pardon me; I am weak, A feeble simple woman, without stay, And witless of your worth; yet I might fear Their policies were no good friends of yours, Could we see all; men's hearts are manifold, Not made of glass like women's such as mine, At once transpicuous and perceptible To eyes like yours that look their faults through; yet Perchance you see more faults than lie there, spots That are not natural to us; or make too much Of our light thoughts and weakness; yet, your pardon: You have reason in it, being more wise than we And stronger in your regency of soul; It may be you do well to bear me hard, And I do ill who think to counsel you; 'Tis no great matter; for in no great while My weakness will be medicine to itself And end as I do: no default of mine But must by dying be curable; and God knows I little think to live. Darnley. Why, have no fear; You see I stand 'twixt you and all such threat. Queen. Nay, I see not; but though you be my friend, How far soever you stand out for me, There is one threat that no man's help in the world Can bring to nothing; here it speaks in me Mortal; I know the word inevitable That without breath or sound has called me dead; I would not plead against it. Darnley. Nay, you dream; You jest or dream. Queen. I do not; I am dead; What, have you slain in jest, or in a dream Have I seen death and felt him in my flesh, Felt my blood turn and my veins fill with death And the pang pass and leave me as I am, Dead? for my state is pangless, and my pain Perished; I have no life to bring forth pain, Or painful fruit of life; I think in pity God willed one stroke of sheer mortality Should kill all possible pain and fear in me, All after chance of ill; I cannot die Twice, and can live not with my dead self here Violently slain; I am sure I have no child; I would but pray, if I had breath to pray, For mere shame's sake and pity's, I might have My women with me; and was not born to want What our most poor bare natural womanhood Seeks not in vain of meanest people; more I seek of no man's mercy. Darnley. You shall have it; But this is fear and shaken heart in you— I trust not very danger. Queen. I that know Must bear the peril and the sense alike And patiently can bear, so but I have Hope of your heart made soft towards me; sir, Howe'er I have been untoward and confident In my blind state and sovereign folly, now God knows me if I have not need of love Who have so much of pardon. Darnley. Is this sure, Such instant and such perilous press of time— Or but your thought it may be? Queen. Nay, my thought! Is it my thought I am stricken to my death? Is it my thought you have no pity of me? Is it my thought I had looked at other time For other joy of childbed, and such pangs As bring glad women honour? not this death That sunders me from fruit of mine own years And youth and comfort, and mere natural hope, And love that looks on many a worse than me? Is it my thought that for small fault of mine, And little lack of love and duteousness, I am brought to shame and mortal chastisement? Is it my thought love is not dead in me For all this chastening? and my penitence Wherewith I weep on my least wrong-doings past, And faith wherewith I look for pardon yet, For grace of you—is all this but my thought? Darnley. By heaven, I will not have you wronged of them. You shall live safe and honourably. Queen. My lord, Who lives in such times honourably or safe, When change of will and violence mutable Makes all state loose and rootless? Think you, men Who have dipped their hands in this red act with you Will, as they wash them, so wash off their hearts The burning spot of raw malignity And fire and hunger of ambition made So proud and full of meat, so rank in strength, So grossly fed and fattened with fresh blood? Is it for love of your name more than mine These men that fought against my love of you, And made rebellious wars on my free choice, Smite now my very head and crown of state In this night's hot and present stroke? Be sure It is the throne, the name, the power in us That here is stabbed and bleeds from such a wound As draws out life of you no less than me If you be part of majesty indeed. Yea, howsoe'er you be now borne in hand, They will but use you as an axe to smite, A brand to set on fire the house of state And in the doing be burnt up of itself. Why, do but think with now more temperate blood What are they that have helped you to this deed? What friends to you? what faith toward royalty, And what good will and surety of sound mind, Have you found in them? or how put in proof? What bond have their loves given you to confirm Their hearts toward you stable? Nay, if this Be all my pledge for honour and safe life, They slide upon a slippery ground indeed. Darnley. The pledge is mine, not theirs; you have my word; No warrant of their giving, but of me; What ails you to go yet in fear of them? Queen. Alas, I know not whom I need yet fear. What men were they who helped you in this deed? Yet it avails not me to know. I think The fierce first root of violence was not set Of you nor of your uncles, though I know They of your mother's kinship love me not; But though their hearts, albeit one blood with yours, Be bitter toward me, yet being of your blood I would fain think them not so hard; and yet It was no gentle sight I had of them, Nor usage; I can see their eyes burn still, And their brows meet against me. Such a sight Again might wind all suffering up in me And give it full release. Darnley. It was their plot; That is, for love of me they felt the offence Eat at their hearts; I did not set them on; But wrath and shame's suspicion for my sake Edged and envenomed; then your policies too, And injuries done the popular weal, the state So far mishandled; this was all men's talk, Mine uncle's chiefly, Ruthven's, and his word Was hot in the ear of Maitland and Argyle, Showing the wrong done and the further fear, More wide in issue and large in likelihood Than all wrong done already; nay, and plain; You would have given the state up to strange hands, And for strange ends; no dreaming doubt of mine, But very vision, proof; they held it so; And, by my faith, I with them. Queen. Morton too? Was not his wit part of your wisdom? Darnley. Ay; Why, all heads highest, all subtlest, could not choose But be one judgment and one counsel here, In such a biting need; yea, common fools, Poor senseless knaves might see it. Queen. Yea, visibly. The sharpest wits and hands put armour on To go forth strong against me; little doubt But fools and ignorance and the common mouth, The very dust o'the street, the dross of man, Must needs take fire with blowing of such wind And stir at such men's passage: their mere feet Moving would raise me up such enemies From the bare ground. Ruthven—you said his breath Was first to heat men's hearing with strange words And set their hearts on edge—and at his touch The quick-eyed Maitland and loose-souled Argyle, Keen to catch fire or fear from other men's— And the full-counselled Morton—by my life, (That's but a little oath now) I think strange To be at all alive, and have such men So sore unfriends and secret, and their wits So sharp to set upon so slight a thing. How grew this up amongst you? Darnley. Why, you see it; No need to set men on; their swords were made To your own follies; yet have comfort; I, That was so little made of, so less worth, In your late judgment, will alone be guard And buckler of you; come what counsel may, It shall not hold against you with my will, And cannot work without. Queen. Nay, that were hard. I thank you; but what counsel will they take, Think you, which way to deal with me? my soul Is womanly distempered and distract With doubts of them—no fear of your good mind, Or your firm love and fruitful—but, alas, I am no strong man as you my guard, and ache With new faint fear of their fresh angers: then, This watch on me, my ways and rooms barred up, No help nor issue, shakes and sickens me With pangs for every stroke in the hour, that says I am so much more time prisoner. Darnley. For your guard, It must be later taken off; the rest I will find mean of help for. They are now In council with your brother, new brought home With seal from me of pardon to reverse Your fresh and rash attainder, in my name Now cancelled and made strengthless; and I think There must three judgments be debated of; Whether for hurt done to the common state And treason to succession you must bear Penance of death or life's imprisonment, Which fear not I will have them put in form Nor see it pass upon you; the third mean Is for some season that you be in ward In Stirling Castle, till your warrant given And free consent to this late justice done, And to the new faith stablished in the realm By right and rule of law, religiously, And to mine own investiture as king. Now for no fear at all or doubt of them But very love and good desire toward you I will go plead your part and take them sign Of seasonable submission; with which word I doubt not but to reconcile their thoughts And bring their loves back bounden to your feet. Queen. Neither do I doubt. Let them draw this bond, I will set hand to what they will of me; To seal you king needs now no grace of mine, Hardly my leave; and for their faith, it has Too firm a foot for my poor power to shake, Had I the will now molten in me strong As ere the fire of fierce necessity Had made it soft and edgeless; for their deed, Say, if they hold my word of pardon worth More than mere scorn, I am bound to thank them, being Masters of me and of my wrath or will, And needing show me no such courtesy; And if it please them take mine oath and hand To sign them safe and mark them from all charge Sackless and scatheless, let them take it; alas, I thought well they might rather take my life, And yet I think well they would take indeed But for your safeguard of me; would they not Slay me? nay, by your honour tell me—nay, I know they would, had I no guard in you, Slay me defenceless. Darnley. Have no fear; I have sworn They shall not touch you roughly. Queen. Swear again, That I may quite rest confident; and yet Swear not; I would not seem to hold you fast To your own peril; better were I dead Than you fell in their danger for my sake. Ah, and I know not, I may hardly think I have you surely on my side. Darnley. By heaven, You shall want nothing of my help or love. Queen. How had you heart to go so near my death? Darnley. I had no mind to hurt you. Queen. None? well, none— I will not think it; yet I was nigh dead. You saw my very death here at my breast Where your child is not yet—I did not think To feel instead there murder's iron lips For his soft suckling mouth. Darnley. Come, think not of it. Queen. I had not time to think of it indeed. But I think now you will have hardly power To match your will to save me, if their will Shall yet be mortal to me; then I saw You had not power or had not will; and now I know not which you have yet. Darnley. They shall find I have power enough and will to turn them. Queen. Well— I lean then on your hand. If you were mine, Though they were subtler and more strong in hate, They should not hold me here in peril. Darnley. How? Queen. No matter, so their guard were less on me. Darnley. You would take flight then? Queen. Ay, with you for wing To lift me out of prison. Darnley. Whither? Queen. Nay, I am but the fool of your keen flattering wit, Who let you see my little hope that lives To see my some day sunnier: yet God knows Without light of you it were lustreless. I can look forth not or heave up my hand But with your help to stay me. Darnley. Surely no, As you stand now you cannot; and I were A faithless fool to mine own fortune, if I loosed you out of sight for wantonness, Who have you now in hand: but for all this It may be flight were no such unwise mean To assure our free and mutual power on them And show them simply subject; as it is, They have some show of hold on us which makes Our reign and freedom questionable and slight: I see some reason in it. Queen. Why, do you think That you being here their gaoler in their eye Can be their king too, or not rather they Lords both of gaol and warder? they will hold you But as the minister of their power on me, Of no more office than a door-keeper Nor honour than their headsman: but fled hence You are very king indeed, by your own hand, Lord of the life you give and majesty, By no man's furtherance and no grant of theirs Made pensioner and proxy for their reign Who should bear rule and you the semblance, worn As mask of all their faces, glove of hands, And hollow trumpet blown of all their mouths, But mine and all their free and sovereign king. Darnley. Why, so I say; they must be borne in hand; Look you, we must not set their fears on edge, They shall suspect not: I will take them word, And bring them to you for your bond. Queen. Meantime, I will but walk an hour here hand in hand With my good brother; let me speak to him While they shall draw the schedule. Darnley. I will bid him Attend you, and your women; but be sure You take him not to counsel: he is wise, And full of malice: let him not be part Of our new mind. Queen. He shall not. Darnley. But you smile— What should he do to know it? Queen. He shall not know. Darnley. Well, you shall see him, and they take off your guard; I will make sure: but when and by what means Think you to fly? Queen. To-night. Darnley. God help your wit! To-night? Queen. Before the change of watch; I have said; Weak as I stand, and burdened, and soul-spent, I will be hence. Mistrust me not for strength; My soul shall make my body like itself, A servant armed to wait upon my thought And page my purpose as its minister Till the end be held in hand. This guard removed, I will find ways out to win forth to-night, Fear not, and servants. Go now to the lords With all submissive mild report of me, And bring them to receive my word and hand To confirmation of what bond they please For pardon and possession of their will; And for your kingship—sir, assure yourself That in few hours it shall be seen and sure You shall need never seek their loves again Or hands to help you to it or tongues to cry, Nor be called king by will of any man Nor lord by choice of any friend on earth. Darnley. Nay, I would need no voices. Queen. And be sure You shall not build your power on loves of theirs Nor live by their election. Go, and thrive: Think how my faith and hope and love in you Find all their rest and stronghold, and on them Set up your trust and standard of your strength. [Exit Darnley. So much is done; go thou then first to death; For from this hour I have thee. Heart, lie still, Till I may make those mightier traitors mine That shall be swords for me to smite him with, And then be free as fire. Enter Mary Beaton. Hast thou no news? Mary Beaton. The lord of Bothwell lies at secret ward To bear you forth of peril here by force; He has gathered up his men beyond the walls To break this guard upon you when you will, If at your suit it shall not be withdrawn; Here is his token brought me privily For your own hand. Queen. No, in my heart it is, My love and lord, thy token; this poor heart That ere mine ear is smitten with thy name Hears it and turns to springing fire. What thanks Would I not rather pay than these of words For this thy loving speed? Yet send him these, And bid him, I would fain say come, but wait Till I have tried my traitors; if my tongue Win them to slack their hold on me to-night, We may speed surelier; if their hands hold fast, Then let him smite and slay and set me free. I would have all their heads here in my lap, Tell him, not one or two slain suddenly, That their blood shed may seem not split by chance Nor lost and won in hazard of affray But sacrificed by judgment, and their names Who would have made of royalty in me Ruin, and marred the general name of king, Shall with their lives be perfectly put out, Royally ruined; wherefore if I may I will steal forth with subtle help of words, Not break their bonds with violence; in which hope Bid him watch close. [Exit Mary Beaton. And when his watch is done It will be morning, and the sun shall break As fire for them that had their hour by night And light for wrath to see them and to slay. Re-enter Arthur Erskine, introducing Murray. Arthur Erskine. Madam, my lord of Murray. Queen. Ah, my brother, Had you been here they had not used me thus. Murray. I am sorry, madam, such things should be done As even the strain of sharp necessity Can make but fierce and bitter. Queen. Is this all? Nay, it was necessary then and just, Or I must seem and strive to think it was, If you say so. But in my present sight, Now when a feather's or a flower's weight borne Might make life stoop within me, sense break down, All strong capacities of nature fail; Now when the hardest heart with iron bound Might turn to very mercy for my sake, Here in mine eye to do my friend to death— For howsoe'er ye hold him, yet being dead I will not say but he was friend of mine Who lies now dead and slaughtered—nay, by heaven, I will not cast that name of friend away Because the man my friend is slain for me— I say, to kill him at my knee, to stain An unborn child's brow with his murdered blood, To affray with sanguine hands, shake with sheer blows, The weak and holy warders of the womb, The reverence and remembrance of us all For that which bare us hidden before birth And after was called mother—O, this deed, This, though all law were cast out of the world, All grace forgotten—this, you will not say But they did ill who did it. What, you weep? These tears are made of our dear father's blood, Who left in each of us such part of him As must yearn each toward other, and divide At need their mutual suffering: I knew well I need not fear to find not in your heart Some natural seed of comfort. Murray. That I weep I take no shame, to see you; but mine eyes Receive more comfort than their tears can give To see, for all this rash and ruthless night, Yet you stand up unwounded, and your heart Is left you to put spirit in your speech Not like a sick man's; if you have no hurt, No hurt is done though they did violently: For this man's life was as a present death To the well-being and peace of all your state, Which by the force of justice done on him Stands now in surety. I would pray you make Your profit of your pain herein, being wise, As you well may; for this was not the man That you saw slain, but the man's policy, Stabbed through with all their daggers; and you see How it lies dead and outcast. I beseech you, For your own love and honour of high rule, Set not your heart toward it to raise it up That men would bury, lest the graveyard reek Of dead men's craft and strange men's creeds brought back Prove poison to you. Queen. I will do what men will. I must not die then? Murray. There are those would have it, For scandal and offence cast on the realm By shame done to the popular commonwealth In majesty made shameful; as they say Through you it hath been, and your dealings known With this dead friend; some that would leave you life Spake of life spent in sharp imprisonment Unto your death's day; but by mine award You are quit of either danger; you must live But under guard till you by word approve This man's despatch for necessary and just, Submit yourself to call your husband king, And own the true faith rooted in this realm For lawful and for sovereign here of rule. So much you shall. Queen. Nay, I will more than this. I will seal now what you will have me seal, What bond soever: let them come to me Who wrought this murderous matter but last night That I may sign their pardon with my tongue Ere they can crave or threaten. Let them come; So shall my perfect purpose be more plain Freely in all things to submit myself— I have your word already—to their will: Ay, even with all my new submissive heart, As else I cannot choose; for what am I That I should think much to submit myself? Murray. You shall do wisely to keep faith with them And make your word your action's measure; so Shall hearts now loosened from you be made fast And love reclaimed wait on you loyally Through all your land's length. See, the lords are come. Enter Darnley, Morton, and Ruthven. Queen. Good morrow, sirs; ye gave me no good night, Yet are you welcome even as life or death Were welcome to me, coming with your will; For without love of my good lords my life Were scarce worth holding out against their will, But if it please them I should die not yet, For their love's sake I give it welcome. Sirs, I have heard what terms ye lay upon mine head, And bow beneath them willingly, being sure It is but meet I should submit myself, It is but fit mere majesty bow down To take the burden by good men and wise Imposed upon it; nor shall this be hard; For what ye did so suddenly and swift, If there be power of pardon in me, here With as good heart even as ye did the deed Do I forgive it; nay, I should give you thanks That ye vouchsafe of me to be forgiven; For what am I among you? Let the bond Be drawn between us presently to sign, While for an hour's space I will walk and wait Here with my noble brother, hand in hand, And heart reposed on heart, eyes answering eyes, With pure plain faith; for what now in the world Should lies or dumb dissembling profit me Though I were natural liar? as I do trust Ye shall not find me but most faithful; yet, If I were falser than the foam of the sea And wilfuller than wind, what should I do, Being yours, to mock you and myself, and lie Against mine own life? for ye see me, sirs, How I stand bare between you, without strength, At your mere mercy, with no friend on earth If ye will be mine unfriends; and I think To live but by your grace and leave, who might If ye were minded speak me out of life Or sign me dead with smiling; I were mad To play with lies, who feel your hands on me So heavy as they are, and have no hope Save to be pitied and believed of you. I pray you then have faith in me, who live In your faith only, and if it fail me here Must die the lowliest death in all the world, And no man's hand to help me. Darnley. She says truth; There is no hand. Morton. Madam, though faith stand fast, Yet fear hath something here to say of you, And wisdom to remember; we must think That what is done in service of yourself You cannot hold good service when it comes So masked in blood, so vizarded like death, As this of ours doth; and that yet in time You may find mean to wreak your wrath on us For having strangely served you, and perforce Given desperation and the dangerous time So desperate a deliverance from despair. We have saved you in this service done the state, Who must have else been broken in the breach Of the state's order and the popular law By this man living violently misused; But cannot hope yet for such thanks of you As even the deed deserves whose fierce despatch Has shaken you with thunder, and its flame Still makes your eyes blind to the good work done And sharp need felt of it; so must this be, And so must we take heed lest being yet blind We give you scope and mean to hurt yourself. Queen. I did not think the thing was yet alive That could fear me. Darnley. Nay, look you, she says right; We have no room to fear her. Queen. Lo, my lords, How dangerous and how strong a thing it is That threatens here your state and safety; see, It is no less than woman, and unarmed, Half dead, unfriended, hard on childbearing, Naked of arms or means; it were not wise To leave unguarded, without spies or swords About her path, so great a danger; yea, Wise men would rather fear her force too much Than good men show compassion. Do your wills; I am well content to know you wise, and so To bear what hard or lighter weight ye please; How sore soever, God knows, I believe It shall not long afflict me. Murray. In my mind It now shall less distract the general eye With apprehension of strange times and strife To see the ways again made clear, and gates Not crowded up with guard. Darnley. Why, so I said. Ruthven. So I say not. Bear with me though I seem Less confident or free of heart than men, Whose minds are gentle as their names, should be In things of common care; what hurt may come By fault of us we know not, but we know It is no private peril; if we err, Not we nor ours must only ache for it, But the whole popular heart of this great land Must bleed and break for our false friendship shown And confident remission of our cause And very duty toward her, through mere wish To be called gentle toward her enemies. Queen. I am her enemy then: where lies my strength? What field? what weapon? how shall we make war, Take truce and break it, with what equal face Stand brow to brow for battle? By this hand, I knew not yet how strong it was, nor worth How many hands of swordsmen; were this true, I might wax proud to be so terrible, Seeing in such great men's eyes so great a fear And only mine own fearful face therein As in a mirror shadowed. Darnley. 'Tis mere truth; We should be shamed to seem in fear of her, Yea, made a mockery in men's eyes and mouths For base and blind misgiving. Ruthven. You, my lords And equals with me in the proof of years, In the age of counsel and experience borne Of common service done our natural state, Shall best pass judgment if in hate or fear I speak for mine own ends or enmities To turn your hearts from honour; for the queen, As she shall be toward God, so I toward her Would be fast friend and servant; but wherein She is not friend with heaven nor with the state I were no friend to serve her, nor to say There were no danger and no sin to serve. Ye must all think I think not to live long; And being so signed of sickness for my grave With such a mortal seal, I speak alive As one being dead that speaketh; if ye lose The grace of God here won by your own hands, The power ye have to serve him, and the effect Of his good hour, through negligence of will Or pride or pity, ye shall see the state Break from your hands, and for one devil cast out Seven entered in its body. Sirs, take heed; The least thing lightly overlooked or done May undo all things wrought. Keep fast your guards; By the king's counsel if they be withdrawn, Upon his head that bade them go shall rest What bloodshed ever follows; yet in time Think nothing weak that is not with us; each May have some sting or weapon of itself That till sloth feel it sees not. Queen. A wise rule: So should the wary wolf pen up the lambs, The falcon set good guard upon the wren, For fear of teeth or talons. Murray. We will give To the king's hand the bond for yours to sign; Meantime all ease and reverence shall you have, And freedom for your household folk to serve As best your need may bid them. Queen. Sirs, farewell. I will not pray you do but what ye will, Which shall seem wisely to me. Let me have Word of their instant sentence. [Aside to Darnley. Darnley. With all speed. [Exeunt Darnley, Murray, Morton, and Ruthven. Queen. Where are my servants Standen and Traquair? Arthur Erskine. At hand to serve your highness. Queen. Ah, to serve! My highness is brought low, too low to claim Service of men; if I may find but love Or only pity of any, this shall be All utmost service I desire of them. I have but my sorrows to my subjects left, And these rebellious; yet I keep what state And rule I may upon them. Tell those twain I pray their patience lend me but the time To hear what I would have them, and to choose If they will do it for pity. Arthur Erskine. Think them here And your will done already. [Exit. Queen. Yea, my will! What knowest thou may my will be? by this light, I feel a heat and hurry of the heart That burns like joy; my blood is light and quick, And my breath comes triumphantly as his That has long laboured for a mountainous goal And sets fast foot on the utmost cliff of all. If ere the race be run my spirit be glad, What when it puts the palm of peril on And breathes clear air and conquers? Nay, I think The doubt itself and danger are as food To strengthen and bright wine to quicken me And lift my heart up higher than my need, Though that be high upon me. Re-enter Erskine with Traquair and Standen. Now, my friends, Ye come unlike to courtiers, come to serve Me most unlike a queen: shall I think yet I have some poor part in your memories safe, And you some care of what I was, and thought How I fare now? Shall I take up my hope, That was cast down into the pit of death, To keep the name God gave me, and the seal That signs me royal, by your loves and faiths Recrowned and reinstated? Say but no, Or say but nought, this hope of mine and heart Are things as dead as yesterday: my cause Lies in your lips, to comfort or confound, As ye see reason. Yet, as power is yours, So let remembrance in you be for light To see the face of the time by; so let faith, Let noble pity and love be part of you, To make you mindful what a cause it is That ye must put in judgment, and what life For fame or shame to you through all time born Ensues upon your sentence; for ye choose If ye will match my dangers with your faiths And help me helpless with your hearts, who lie By grief and fear made heartless; or lend hand To make my weakness weaker, and break down My broken wall of sovereignty; which now Ye wot were no sore labour. Standen. Let him die As heartless toward the grace of God, who hath No heart in him to give its blood for yours! So say we all your servants. Traquair. Did I know it? Queen. Methinks I knew when I bade send for you Ye should so say. Ah friends, I had no fear But I should find me friends in this fierce world, Or I had died unfriended. Shall I thank you For being the true men and the kind ye are, Or take your service thankless, since I thought Ye could not else, being young and of your kinds, But needs must be my help? ye have not hearts To strike but at men weaponed; ye would not Lay hard hand on a woman weak with child, A sick sad woman that was no man's queen Of all that stood against her; yet her son, The unborn thing that pleads again with you As it could plead not with them, this dumb voice, This sightless life and sinless, was their king's, If ever they would let it come to life. Lo, here their aim was; here the weapons went That should have stabbed to death the race of kings And cut their stem down to the root; here, here The pistol's mouth that bruised my breast, the hand That struck athwart my shoulder, found their mark, Made here their point to shoot at; in my womb By them the bud of empire should have died That yet by you may live and yet give thanks For flower and fruit to them that saved the seed. Standen. They shall die first. Traquair. Command us what next way There is to serve you, though the way were fire We would be through it. Queen. To-night then at first watch I purpose with the man's help—nay, what name Shall his be now? king, husband, or, God help, King's father?—with the man that you called king As I called husband, to win forth of bonds By the close covered passage underground That by strange turns and strait blind working ways Winds up into the sovereign cemetery Whose dust is of my fathers; therewithout Wait you with horse; and when you see us rise Out of the hollow earth among the dead, Be ready to receive and bear us thence. Some two hours' haste will speed us to Dunbar, Where friends lie close, and whence with sudden strength I trust to turn on these good lords again. Do this for such poor love's sake as your queen's, And if there be thanks worthy in the world, Them shall she give; not silver, sirs, nor gold, Nor the coined guerdon that is cast on churls To coin them into service; but a heart, If not worth love, yet loving, and a faith That will die last of all that dies in me And last of all remembrances foregone Let your names go. God speed you, and farewell. Scene II. —Ruins of the Abbey of Holyrood. Enter Arthur Erskine, Traquair, and Standen. Standen. It must be time; the moon is sick and slow That should by this be higher. Arthur Erskine. It is your eye Whose sight is slow as sickness; for the moon Is seasonable and full: see where it burns Between the bare boughs and the broken tombs Like a white flower whose leaves were fire: the night Is deep and sharp wherein it hangs, and heaven Gives not the wind a cloud to carry, nor Fails one faint star of all that fill their count To lend our flight its comfort; we shall have Good time of heaven and earth. Traquair. How shall the steeds Be shared among us? Arthur Erskine. If she keep her mind, My English gelding best shall bear the queen, And him the Naples courser. Hark, they come. Standen. It was a word said of the wind to hear What earth or death would answer. These dead stones Are full of hollow noises though the vault Give tongue to no man's footfall; when they come It will speak louder. Lo how straight that star Stands over where her face must break from earth As it hath broken; it was not there before, But ere she rise is risen. I would not give The third part of this night between us shared For all the days that happiest men may live Though I should die by morning. Traquair. Till she come, I cannot choose but with my fears take thought, Though all be after her sweet manner done And by her wise direction, what strange ways And what foul peril with so faint a guard Must of so tender feet be overpast Ere she win to us. Arthur Erskine. All these with laughing lips Shall she pass through; the strength and spring of soul That set her on this danger will sustain Those feet till all her will and way be won. Her spirit is to her body as a staff And her bright fiery heart the traveller's lamp That makes all shadow clear as its own light. Enter from the vaults the Queen and Darnley. Queen. Here come the wind and stars at once on us; How good is this good air of that full heaven That drives the fume back of the sepulchres And blows the grave away! Have no more fear; These are no dead men. Darnley. Nay, I fear no dead; Nothing I fear of quick or dead but God. Shall I not go before you? Queen. Not a foot. See you, my friends, what valiant hearts are here, My lord's and mine, who hardly have crept forth, In God's fear only, through the charnel house, Among the bones and skulls of ancient kings That thought not shame to stand for stumbling stones In their poor daughter's way, whose heart had failed But that his hardier heart held up her feet Who even if winds blew did not shrink nor shake For fear of aught but God. The night is kind, And these March blasts make merry with the moon That laughs on our free flight. Where stand your steeds? Arthur Erskine. Madam, hard by in shadow of the stones; Please you, this way. Queen. I will to horse with you. Darnley. No, but with me. Queen. It is not my good will. Ride you alone, and safer. Friend, your arm. Scene III. —Murray's Lodging in Holyrood. Enter Murray, Morton, and Ruthven. Morton. There is no present help; the violent speed Of these fierce days has run our chances down. It is found certain she comes back to-day; Soon as their flight drew bridle at Dunbar, Yet hot from horse, she sends for Bothwell in With all his border thievery, red-foot knaves, The hardiest hinds of Liddesdale; next him His new bride's brother, Huntley, more in care To win the land back than revenge the blood His father lost for treason; after these Caithness with Athol, and the queen's chief strengths, The earl marshal and the archbishop; in few days Eight thousand swords to wait on that sweet hand Was worth so little manhood; then Argyle, Who should have been a sea-wall on our side Against the foam of all their faction, he, Struck to the heart with spite and sharp despair Through proof late made of English faith—as you, My lord of Murray, felt it when ye twain Sought help and found false heart there—casts himself Over upon her side; with him two more Her last year's rebels, Rothes and Glencairn, And pardon sealed for all that rose with them Who were not of our counsel in this death. Thus fare we without help or hope of these, And from the castle here of Edinburgh The hot Lord Erskine arms in our offence His mounted guns, making the queen more strong Than had her flight won first its darkling walls And for a free camp in the general field Set up her strength within the fortress here Which serves her now for outwork, while behind The whole force raised comes trooping to her hand. In this deep strait that our own hands have dug And our own follies channelled, to let in Storm on our sails and shipwreck on our hopes, My counsel is that whoso may stand fast Should here in harbour bide his better day, And we make land who may not; you, my lord, As by James Melville she solicits you, May honourably assure your peace with her, Being speckless in her sight of this man's blood; We that dipped open hand in it must hence, And watch the way of the wind and set of storm Till the sea sink again. Ruthven. Sir, so say I; You serve not us a whit nor change our chance By tarrying on our side. Let no man fly For our deed's sake but we that made our deed The witness for us not to be gainsaid By foe of ours or friend we have on earth. It was well done; what else was done, and ill, We must now bear the stroke of, and devise Some healing mean in season. This is sure, That faith or friendship shall leave no long life Where friendship is engraffed on breach of faith; But shame, despite, division, and distrust Shall eat the heart out of their amity, And hate unreconcile their heartless hands Whom envious hope made fast or cunning fear. This cannot be but nigh: and ye that live Shall see more sure for this blind hour's default And hold more fast and watch more heedfully The new chance given for this chance cast away. I shall not see it, how near soe'er; and yet The day that I shall die in banishment Is not much nigher than must their doom's day be Whose trust is in the triumph of their hour. Mine is now hard on end; but yours shall last, I doubt not, till its service be all done And comfort given our people. Take the lairds Grange and Pittarrow with you to the queen; Ye shall find peace and opportunity With present welcome as for proffered love; Make swift agreement with her; this shall be The surest staff that hope may take in hand. Farewell. Murray. I would not say it, if ye not knew My faith departs not with me from your side Nor leaves the heart's bond broken of our loves; But in this trust, though loth, I take farewell, To give you welcome ere the year be dead. Ruthven. Me shall you not, nor see my face again, Who ere the year die must be dead; mine eyes Shall see the land no more that gave them light, But fade among strange faces; yet, if aught I have served her, I should less be loth to leave This earth God made my mother. Murray. Then farewell, As should his heart who fares in such wise forth To take death's hand in exile. I must fare Ill now or well I know not, but I deem I have as much as you of banishment Who bear about me but the thought of yours. Scene IV. —Holyrood. The Queen and Sir James Melville. Queen. Am I come back to be controlled again, And of men meaner? must I hold my peace Or set my face to please him? Nay, you see How much miscounselled is he, strayed how far From all men's hope and honour, and to me How strange and thankless, whom in self-despite You will me yet to foster: I would live Rather the thrall of any hind on earth. Sir James Melville. I would but have your wisdom hide somewhile The sharpness of your spirit, whose edge of wrath There is no man but now sees manifest; As there is none who knows him that hath cause To love or honour; yet great pity it is To see what nobler natural mind he had And the first goodness in him so put out By cursed counsel of his mother's kin, The bastard Douglas, and such ill friends else As most are unfriends: but this fire in you Who chose him, being so young, of your own will, Against the mind of many, for your lord, Shall rather burn yourself than purge his mood, And the open passion of your heart and hate Hearten in him the hate he bears not you But them that part you from him. Twice, you know, Or now my tongue were less for love's sake bold, Twice hath it pleased your highness charge me speak When time or need might seem for counsel; then That thus you charged me, now such need is come, Forgive that I forget not. Queen. I might well, Did you forget, forgive not; but I know Your love forgot yet never any charge That faith to me laid on it; though I think I never bade you counsel me to bear More than a queen might worthily, nor sought To be advised against all natural will That with mine honour now is joined to speak And bid me bear no more with him, since both Take part against my patience. For his hate, Henceforth shall men more covet it than fear; My foot is on its head, that even to-day Shall yield its last poor power of poison up, And live to no man's danger till it die. Enter Darnley and Murray. Welcome, dear brother and my worthy lord, Who shall this day by your own word be clear In all men's eyes that had ill thoughts of you. Brother, to-day my lord shall purge himself By present oath before our councillors Of any part in David's murdered blood, And stand as honourable in sight of all Whose thought so wronged him as in mine he doth Who ever held him such as they shall now. Murray. Must he swear this? Darnley. Who says I shall not swear? Queen. He has given his faith to swear so much to-day, And who so shameless or so bold alive As dare doubt that? Murray. Not I: in God's name, no; No more than any other. Darnley. Nay then, well. I am not angry. Queen. 'Tis the noblest mood That takes least hold on anger; those faint hearts That hold least fire are fain to show it first; The man that knows himself most honourable Fears least or doubts if others hold him so; But he that has small honour in himself Is quick to doubt what men may deem of him And thence most swift in anger as in fear Of men's imagined judgments; praised be God, Our lord is none such. Is the deed not drawn That gives into our servant Bothwell's hand The forfeit lands of Maitland for his own That by his former fault stand forfeited? Murray. Is it your purpose he shall have those lands? Queen. It is my very purpose. Murray. I grieve at it. Queen. Grieve or be glad, it stands my purpose yet. We should be gone to meet our councillors; My heart thinks long till it shall know my lord Held of the world as noble as of me. Darnley. It is not time. Queen. No, but much more than time. Come with me, brother. [Exeunt Queen and Murray. Sir James Melville. I am sorry for your grace. Darnley. You must not think I know not all this while That she doth mock me. Sir James Melville. Nay, her mood may change. Darnley. Never for me. I had been much better dead Than cast off thus, who cast mine own friends off And knew not for whose sake. She hath slain the men Who kept that night the gates while he was slain; I would she had rather taken too my blood Than put my life to shame; yet I may live To put that off upon her; had I friends, Shame should go back from me to her, who thinks To lay it on her wedded lord and laugh; As I may one day laugh yet. Hear you news Of Morton and mine uncle? Sir James Melville. They are fled; I hear but this, not whither. Darnley. As they brewed, So let them drink; the hands were none of mine That mixed that cup to them; so much I swear, And may so much with honour. Yet would God I had not chosen to lose their loves for hers, And found so cold her favour. Scarce escaped, Scarce out of bonds, half breathless yet with flight, No mind was in her of my help, my love, My hand that brake her prison; for all this, My kin forsaken, mine own wrongs and griefs Forgotten, mine own head imperilled, mine For hers that I delivered and perchance To leave within their danger had done well, No thought or thanks I get of her: and these That had I stood by them might stand by me When I shall need, may mock me for her fool And curse me for their traitor. Yet I think, Were I once clear of her as now of these, Please God, to make mine own strength by myself, Being both ways free; I know not well yet how, But I will take mine own part yet or die. [Exeunt. Scene V. —A Street. Enter Two Burgesses. First Burgess. What is this news that flies so in the dark Like a night-bird whereof we know it is But of what wing we know not? Second Burgess. This that comes From the exiled lords in England, to make bare The face of Darnley's falsehood, with what lips He swore his deed away and damned himself? They had no sooner knowledge of such shame Than word was sent of him through all the land, Large witness of his full complicity And conscience with them of the work to be For which they groan in barren banishment While he crawls here before the scornful queen, And has betrayed the blood of his allies To the axe's edge of unjust judgment. First Burgess. One By treason of his tongue already slain Now speaks of him with breathless mouth to God; And Maitland and two more lie under doom Through but his witness: yet for all this shame It seems he has won small guerdon save the shame, But hath his treason for his treason's fee; And this more comfort, to behold the man That by his lips and nobler hands than his Was done to righteous death, and thrust in earth Before the main door of this Abbey church, Unearthed again and nobly reinterred Hard by the grave's edge of Queen Magdalen, That men may judge how near he grew alive To the queen's side yet living; where instead A worthier stay now in her brother stands For her false lord to look upon and loath No less than David, and much more to fear, Whom with that David he laid trains to slay Aforetime, and again made vaunt but now In the queen's sight to slay him; or so herself Gave word to the earl, and willed him make demand Of the king's own false fearful mouth; but he, Whom thus perchance she sought to make the sword To pierce her husband, modestly bespake Before her face this caitiff like a friend, And was put off with faint excuse; and yet Heart-wrung to see him stand or any man Fast in her favour, like one sick with grief The king flies forth to Glasgow, where apart His father's head is hidden; and there as here He sits not in men's sight now royally, But with some six or eight goes up and down Even where he lists, and none takes note of him; While the miscounselled queen, grown high in mind, Holds privy commerce with the brood o'the Pope Whose plots corrupt the northward English air, And with the murderous Irish, to put out The live light of our God from sea to sea With insurrection of the fires of hell And smoke of slaughter; meantime she reclaims Of the English queen for prisoners to her hand The death-doomed lords in exile; and men say They find scant countenance of the southern court; Yet they think not she will deliver them. Second Burgess. One is there hath found sure deliverance; No chain of man's can mark him prisoner more, Nor whence he rests can any banish him; Ruthven is dead. First Burgess. God hath his friend then safe; For God's friend he was ever; and hath died Most fortunately; seeing not what we live Too soon to see. Second Burgess. He was a nobler man Than his own name was noble; no Scot born More true to the old love of his natural land Nor stouter-hearted on the gospel side Of all that stood to serve it. Yet have these As valiant servants; Morton, though cast out, Lives secret yet in England, whence the queen Dares not I think for shame's sake yield him up To this queen's bloody judgment, or for fear And hostile heart she will not. We shall know Shortly what upshot God will bring of all; Whate'er this be, there will be none again That shall do Darnley good. First Burgess. I saw him swear That day before the council; he was pale As one half drunken, stammering as in wrath, With insolent forehead and irresolute eyes, Between false fear and shameful hardihood, With frontless face that lied against itself, And trembling lips that were not yet abashed For all their trembling. Second Burgess. Ay, good cause was there To shake him to the soul, having cast off Friendship and faith of good men, yet being still Signed with their enemies' blood too plain and broad To gain the good will of unrighteousness. When his day comes that men are weary of him, God shall strike home. First Burgess. Then should that stroke be swift; For evil and good alike are weary of him. Scene VI. —Castle of Alloa. Murray and Darnley. Darnley. Shall I not see her? but if I see her not I will be wroken of you that shut me out, By God I will. What, are ye not combined, You, my false-blooded brother, demi-prince, And Bothwell, and the trustless fool Argyle, With her to unmake me? I shall foil you though, Yea, were all three made each a triple man With thrice your heart and wit. Murray. You strike too high And shear but air in sunder: there's none yet That wills you so much evil as yourself, Would you but think it. Turn your wrath on me, It cannot wound or fright out of its peace A soul that answers not your hate, nor works By night or light against you. Darnley. Swear me that, And if a devil there be I am rid of you Whom he will gripe at once and hale to hell; You took not word to Melville from my wife Of warning with rebuke for his past pains To reconcile us, and with charge to be No more familiar with me for her sake; You were not of her counsel to lie in At Stirling, whence she fled from sight of me, Who following hither was again cast off, And till our child was born in Edinburgh Might scarce have sight of her, and may not now When scarce a month delivered she comes back To take by sea and land her pleasure here Of hunt or sail among the firths and hills In such fair fellowship as casts out mine; It was not you that knew this and approved; I pray you swear it. Murray. You are lesser than a child That, being as simple, yet by innocence Exceeds you naturally. What cause have I Or power to wrong you? what good thing of yours Should I desire to strip from you and wear, What gold or grace to gird myself withal And stand up clad in thievish ornament To take your place thrust out? Conspiracy Should have some gain for warrant of itself, With vantage of some purpose; none lays wait To slay or steal save what may profit him; So sit you safe enough. Darnley. I shall not see her? Murray. If you will be well counselled, no; her mood Is hard and keener since your child was born, And she, new-risen from childbed, hither came To taste the savour and sweetness of the sea, I think, with no mind you should follow her; Nor am myself, howbeit you hold me hers, And of one counsel to put down your hopes, More near her favour; one man's eye alone Sees her face favourable, one only ear Hears her speak soft; if he be friend of mine, You know as I know. Darnley. Why, ye are reconciled; I have heard what care she had to appease both parts, When you before her face had braved him, saying, Ere he rest Maitland's forfeit land and state Some score as honourable as he should die, And she had cast herself across your wrath With reconciling passion; ay, my lord, Take note we are not so dull of ear or brain But we hear word of you and understand The traitors that ye all are, all, to me, The false heart and the lying lips that serve The murderous meaning of your will, and hers The first and worst. What, will ye have my life? Is it my helpless blood that she would take To serve for christening water to her child, And for the font no gift of English gold Though bright and hollow and void as English love, But the strait coffin, the vile shell of death, That hides and bears me graveward? but I live, To save myself and to revenge I live, And will not die for all you. Enter the Queen and Bothwell. Queen. What is this That makes such wrathful or such woful war Even on our ears, and here? We bade you not Come brawl before us like a groom, and break Our breath of peace with cries of contumely. Here is not room enough for rioters' threats To ring through and return; in Edinburgh You have leave to brawl and wail and swear and cry, Feed where you list, and love; here I would rest, With thus much leave yet by your gracious grant, That I may somewhile sit apart, and think What man I have to husband. Darnley. I will go: I would I had not come between your eyes Nor now nor ever. Queen. Then they had never learnt What makes or makes not man worth looking on. Darnley. Am I not worth your eye? Queen. I pray, go back; I would not say what you are worth or no. Darnley. I am yet worth two bastards; and this man, If he shall do me less than right, by heaven, Shall wear the proof upon him. Murray. Sir, your words Are as swords drawn of drunkards' hands, which first Feel their edge bite; me can they make not shrink, You they may pierce, and slay your own good name, If any man be that gives ear to you. Darnley. You will not fight with me? Queen. What, in our face? Hath fear gone after shame? Murray. Let him pass hence; He hath said truth once; we shall not fight. Queen. I charge you Make straight atonement; else, though shame be dead, I will find means to raise up fear alive. Darnley. Nay, I spake hot and hastily; my lord, You know I bear no bitter heart toward you; I am more of quick tongue than of evil will. Murray. Sir, so I hold you. Darnley. So you do but right. Nor will I stay to chafe your majesty That has all power to bid me to and fro, Who yet was called your lord once of the priest, And am no lord but servant. [Exit. Queen. Said you, once? Not once but twice he hath spoken truth to-day. Yet sits it strange upon his lips. Murray. I would He had come not hither, or you not bidden him back. Queen. What, should he stay? Fair brother, wot you well, I had rather touch in the dark a serpent's flesh And with its body and breath confound mine own Than with his breath and body. Never more, By Mary Virgin, while these limbs are mine And these my living lips, never will I Pollute myself with him; by kiss nor touch Shall ever he defile me. Nay too, see, (You have not seen) what privacies he hath With what strange friends; here have I to my hand Letters of his to Philip and the Pope, That they should know I am slacker toward the faith Than Rome would have me, or Spain; he swears I am cold, I have cast off care (God wot) to serve the church, And he it is, my lord, being strong in faith, Expounds mine unfaith to them. Bothwell. Hath he sworn To sleep for their sakes in a naked grave? If this were blown among the popular folk Scant time there were to sew his shroud, I ween, Ere earth were shed upon him. Murray. Ay, but, sir, They must not know it; it were not well they knew; Nor shall it be put forth among them. Bothwell. No! It shall not? Murray. By my will it shall not be. Bothwell. His will! and shall not! Is it queen or king That holds the rod of rule in Scotland here? Madam, what says your sometime majesty Of such a kingly will? since, for your own, It has no power, it shall not fight with his, Shall not have way, nor shall not be at all, Except it swim with his will. Murray. This is nought. Bothwell. Yea truly, nought shall be this will of yours, This potent will that shall not tread us down; Yea, what you will or will not, all is nought, Nought as your name, or title to bear rule Within the realm possessed more royally. Murray. 'Tis not a score as big-voiced men as this Shall make me weak with wagging of their tongues That I should loose what lies into my hand. Madam, what faith I bear you and goodwill, If that you know not, let the time and proof, Not mine own lips, be witness; in this realm I have some power to serve you, by no craft Unjustly purchased nor by force of hand Won masterfully: and for God's love and yours That which I may I will do to keep fair In the open eye of all men your good name And power which if that name be blown against With windy whispers of ill-minded folk, Or such as see your marriage-bed lie cold And know not wherefore, dies out of your hand And is no more for ever. Therefore is it I would not the worst cause of strife you have Were opened to the people; for himself, You know if ever love between us were Since first I fell under your stroke of wrath For his sole sake, whose match then made with you I would betimes have broken, but being made Would not now see rent shamefully in twain That men should speak you wrong. Queen. You are honourable; But yet the whole worst cause you know not of, That even his father Lennox writes me here Letters to put the charge thereof away And clear himself of fellowship therein, Assuring his own honesty, albeit His word is worthless with his son my lord And his name held not as a father's name. This letter will I lay before the lords That they may see what manner of cause he hath To plead against us with what likelihood, When his own father shall forswear his cause. I am assured he hath set his lewd light mind, Out of what fear I know not or what shame, To flee forth of the kingdom and take ship For the islands westward of that southern cape Where the out-thrust heel of England cleaves the sea— But God knows how to live there, if by spoil Or what base mean of life; only thus much In parley with the French ambassador He hath avowed, and wept to tell of wrongs That as he swears have driven him down to this. Murray. He is a fool, and vile; yet let not him Be the more dangerous to you even for this, That he is vile and foolish; there should be Wise means to curb and chain the fool in him Without the scandal of the full-mouthed world. Queen. Such have I sought; and presently I think To have him brought again in Edinburgh Before the lords in council, even those men Who stood in arms against him with yourself When first there grew debate upon our match (Which I could pray now with too tardy tongue That God had given you force to break indeed), And were of counsel with him afterward In David's bloodshed, and betrayed of him Into mine hand again for perfect fear, Fear and false heart; even before these, I say, Whose threefold memory of him so must knit Their hearts to his, there shall he plead, and say If he have aught against me blameworthy, Or what he would; so shall he be displayed And we in the eyes of all men justified That simply deal with him and honourably, Not as by cunning or imperious hand, But plain as with an equal. Bothwell. By my head, Your counsel, madam, is more than man's poor wit. Murray. It may do well: would all were well indeed! I see no clearer way than this of yours Nor of more peaceful promise. I will go To bid my friends together of the lords Who will be counselled of me, and to show Your purpose righteous: so I take my leave. [Exit. Queen. Is not that light red over sea? Bothwell. Blood-red. Queen. The wind has fallen; but there the clouds come up; We shall not sail to-day. Bothwell. No; here will be No woman's weather. Queen. Yet I had in mind Either to sail or drive the deer to-day. I fear not so much rainfall or sea-drift That I should care to house and hide my head. I never loved the windless weather, nor The dead face of the water in the sun; I had rather the live wave leapt under me, And fits of foam struck light on the dark air, And the sea's kiss were keen upon my lip And bold as love's and bitter; then my soul Is a wave too that springs against the light And beats and bursts with one great strain of joy As the sea breaking. You said well; this light Is like shed blood spilt here by drops and there That overflows the red brims of the cloud And stains the moving water: yet the waves Pass, and the spilt light of the broken sun Rests not upon them but a minute's space; No longer should a deed, methinks, once done Endure upon the life of memory To stain the days thereafter with remorse And mar the better seasons. Bothwell. So think I. Queen. If I were man I would be man like you. Bothwell. What then? Queen. And being so loved as you of me, I would make use of love, and in good time Put the scythe to it and reap; it should not rot As corn ungarnered, it should bring forth bread And fruit of life to strengthen me: but, mark, Who would eat bread must earn bread: would you be King? Bothwell. Nay, but servant ever to my queen. Queen. Let us go forth; the evening will be fair. Scene VII. —Edinburgh. The Parliament-House. The Queen seated in state; near her Du Croc and Murray; Darnley in front, as at his arraignment; on the one side the Lords of the Congregation; on the other those of the Queen's party, Bothwell, Huntley, Caithness, Athol, and the Archbishop of St. Andrews. Queen. My lords, ye hear by his own word of hand How fair and loyally our father writes, To purge his name that had indeed no soil Of any blame to usward; though he have No power upon our wedded lord his son To heal his heart's disease of discontent: Which, for myself, before God's face and yours I do protest I know not what thing done Hath in my lord begotten or brought forth, Nor of what ill he should complain in me. Nay, here in very faith and humbleness I turn me to him and with clasped hands beseech That he would speak even all his mind of me, In what thing ever I have given my lord offence, And if before him I stand blameworthy Would lay my blame for burden on my head In this high presence; which to bear shall be At once for penance and instruction to me Who know not yet my lightest fault by name. Ochiltree. So would we all be certified of you, Sir, that your cause may stand forth visibly, And men take cognizance of it who see Nor root nor fruit now of your discontent; We pray you then make answer to the queen. Du Croc. My lord, you have held me for a friend, and laid A friend's trust on me; for that honour's sake For which I am bounden to you, give me now But leave to entreat you in all faith of heart Dishonour not yourself nor this great queen By speech or silence with a show of shame; Let it be seen shame hath no portion here, But honour only and reconciled remorse That pours its bitter balm into the wound Of love somewhile divided from itself And makes it whole; I pray you, be it so now. Queen. An honourable petition, my good lord, And one that comes reverberate from my heart. Darnley. I will not stand the question. Are ye set To bait me like a bondslave? Sirs, I think There is no worthier man of you than I, Whom ye would chide and bait and mock; howbeit, Ye shall not wring out of my smitten lips, As from a child's ye scourge till he speak truth, One word I would not; rather being thus used I will go forth the free man that I came, No nobler, but as noble. For your grace, I have stood too near you now to fall behind And stand far back with vassal hat plucked off To bow at bidding; therefore with free soul For a long time I take farewell and go, Commending you to God; and if as seems I was or nought or grievous in your eye, It shall not take offence this many a day At this that here offends it. So I have done; Enough said is said well. Bothwell (aside to the Queen). I never saw Such heart yet in the fool. Madam, speak now; I wot he hath made a beard or two of them Nod favourably. Queen. What should I say? not I. Bothwell. Speak to the ambassador; bid him take heed This feather fly not shipward, and be blown Out of our hand; speak to him. Queen. Have no such fear; He will not fly past arm's length; the French lord Will hold him safe unbidden. Look, they talk. Bothwell. And yet I would he had spoken not so high. I did not think but he would bend, and mourn Like a boy beaten. Queen. With what sorrow of heart, My lords, we have heard such strange and harsh reply To our good words and meaning, none of you But must be as ourself to know it well. But since nor kindliness nor humble speech Nor honest heart of love can so prevail Against the soul of such inveteracy, But wilful mind will make itself more hard Than modesty and womanhood are soft Or gentleness can speak it fair, we have not One other tear to weep thereon for shame. So without answer, yea, no word vouchsafed, As all ye witness, no complaint, no cause, No reason shown, but all put off in wrath,— I would not say, ourself in you, my lords, Mocked with defiance,—it were but a scorn To hold our session further. Thus in grief Will we fare hence and take of you farewell, Being southward bounden, as ye know, to hear At Jedburgh what complaint of wrong there is Between our own folk and the bordering men, Whose wardens of the English side have wrought us Fresh wrong but late; and our good warden here Shall go before us to prepare our way. Scene VIII. —Hermitage Castle. The Queen and Bothwell. Bothwell. I did not think you could have rid so fast. Queen. There is no love in you to lift your heart, Nor heart to lift the fleshly weight, and bear Forward: I struck my love even as a spur Into the tired side of my horse, and made it Leap like a flame that eats up all its way Till I were here. Bothwell. Why came you not before? Queen. What, am I now too slow? Bothwell. Ay, though you rode Beyond the sun's speed, yea, the race of time That runs down all men born. Forgive it me That I was wroth and weary for your love, Here lying alone, out of your eyes; I could not But chafe and curse, sending my spirit forth From this maimed flesh yet halting with its wound To move about you like a thought, and bring me Word of your works and ways. Queen. I could not come. Bothwell. Was there so much work worthier to be done Than this, to give love and to take again Thus? but for my part, of all things in the world I hold this best, to love you; and I think God never made your like for man to love. Queen. You are my soldier; but these silk-soft words Become your lips as well as mine, when love Rekindles them; how good it is to have A man to love you! here is man indeed, Not fool or boy, to make love's face ashamed, To abash love's heart and turn to bitterness The sweet blood current in it. O my fair lord! How fairer is this warrior face, and eyes With the iron light of battle in them left As the after fire of sunset left in heaven When the sun sinks, than any fool's face made Of smiles and courtly colour! Now I feel As I were man too, and had part myself In your great strength; being one with you as I, How should not I be strong? It is your deed, By grace of you and influence, sir, it is That I fear nothing; how should I lift up Mine eyes to your eyes, O my light o'the war, And dare be fearful? yours but looked upon, Though mine were timorous as a dove's affrayed, For very shame would give them heart, and fire To meet the eyes of danger. What were I To have your love and love you, and yet be No more than women are whose name is fear And their hearts bloodless—I, who am part of you, That have your love for heart's blood? Shall I think The blood you gave me fighting for my sake Has entered in my veins and grown in me To fill me with you? O, my lord, my king, Love me! I think you cannot love me yet, That have done nought nor borne for love of you; But by the eye's light of all-judging God That if I lie shall burn my soul in hell, There is not in this fierce world anything, Scorn, agony, stripes, bonds, fears, woes, deep shame, Kingdomless ruin, but with open hands, With joyous bosom open as to love, Yea, with soul thankful for its great delight And life on fire with joy, for this love's sake I would embrace and take it to my heart. Bothwell. Why, there should need not this to love you well; What should you have to bear for me, my queen, Or how should I more love you? Nay, sweet, peace, Let not your passion break you; your breast burns, Your very lips taste bitter with your tears. Queen. It is because—O God that pities us!— I may not always lie thus, may not kneel, Cling round your hands and feet, or with shut eyes Wait till your lips be fast upon my face, And laugh with very love intolerable As I laugh now—look, now I do not weep, I am not sad nor angered against heaven That ever he divides us; I am glad That yet I have mine hour. Sweet, do not speak, Nor do not kiss me; let mine eyes but rest In the love's light of yours, and for a space My heart lie still, late drunken with love's wine, And feel the fierce fumes lessen and go out And leave it healed. O, I have bled for you The nearest inward blood that is my life Drop by drop inly, till my swooning heart Made my face pale—I should look green and wan If by heart's sickness and blood-wasting pain The face be changed indeed; for all these days Your wound bled in me, and your face far off Was as a moving fire before mine eyes That might not come to see you; I was dead, And yet had breath enough, speech, hearing, sight, To feel them strange and insupportable; I know now how men live without a heart. Does your wound pain you? Bothwell. What, I have a wound? Queen. How should one love enough, though she gave all, Who had your like to love? I pray you tell me, How did you fight? Bothwell. Why, what were this to tell? I caught this reiver, by some chance of God, That put his death into mine hand, alone. And charged him; foot to foot we fought some space, And he fought well; a gallant knave, God wot, And worth a sword for better soldier's work Than these thieves' brawls; I would have given him life To ride among mine own men here and serve, But he would nought; so being sore hurt i'the thigh I pushed upon him suddenly, and clove His crown through to the chin. Queen. I will not have you Henceforth for warden of these borders, sir: We have hands enow for that and heads to cleave That but their wives will weep for. Bothwell. Have no fear; This hour had healed me of more grievous wounds; When it shall please you sign me to your side, Think I am with you. Queen. I must ride—woe's me! The hour is out. Be not long from me, love; And till you come, I swear by your own head I will not see the thing that was my lord Though he came in to Jedburgh. I had thought To have spoken of him, but my lips were loth To mar with harsh intrusion of his name The least of all our kisses. Let him be; We shall have time. How fair this castle stands! These hills are greener, and that singing stream Sings sweeter, and the fields are brighter faced, Than I have seen or heard; and these good walls That keep the line of kingdom, all my life I shall have mind of them to love them well. Nay, yet I must to horse. Bothwell. Ay must you, sweet; If you will ride thus fifty mile a day, But for your face you should be man indeed. Queen. But for my face? Bothwell. If you will make me mad— Queen. I dare not dwell with madmen; sir, farewell. Bothwell. But for your love and for its cruelty, I would have said, you should be man. Queen. Alas! But for my love? nay, now you speak but truth; For I well knew there was no love in man. But we grow idle in this our labouring time; When we have wrought through all the heat o'the day, We may play then unblamed, and fear no hand To push us each from other; now farewell. Scene IX. —The Queen's Lodging at Jedburgh. The three Maries. Mary Carmichael. What, will she die? how says this doctor now? Mary Seyton. He thinks by chafing of her bloodless limbs To quicken the numbed life to sense again That is as death now in her veins; but surely I think the very spirit and sustenance That keeps the life up current in the blood Has left her as an empty house for death, Entering, to take and hold it. Mary Beaton. I say, no; She will not die of chance or weariness; This fever caught of riding and hot haste Being once burnt out, as else nought ails her, will not Leave her strength tainted; she is manly made, And good of heart; and even by this her brain, We see, begins to settle; she will live. Mary Carmichael. Pray God she may, and no time worse than this Come through her death on us and all her land Left lordless for men's swords to carve and share; Pray God she die not. Mary Beaton. From my heart, amen! God knows and you if I would have her die. Mary Seyton. Would you give up your loving life for hers? Mary Beaton. I shall not die before her; nor I think, Live long when she shall live not. Mary Seyton. A strange faith: Who put this confidence in you? or is it But love that so assures you to keep life While she shall keep, and lose when she shall lose For very love's sake? Mary Beaton. This I cannot tell, Whence I do know it; but that I know it I know, And by no casual or conjectural proof Not yet by test of reason; but I know it Even as I know I breathe, see, hear, feed, speak, And am not dead and senseless of the sun That yet I look on: so assuredly I know I shall not die till she be dead. Look, she is risen. Enter the Queen, supported by attendants. Queen. What word was in your lips? That I must die? Mary Seyton. Heaven hath not such hard heart. Queen. I think I shall not, surely, by God's grace; Yet no man knows of God when he will bring His hour upon him. I am sick and weak, And yet unsure if I be whole of mind. I think I have been estranged from my right wits These some days back; I know not. Prithee tell me, Have I not slept? I know you who you are; You were about me thus in our first days, When days and nights were roseleaves that fell off Without a wind or taint of chafing air But passed with perfume from us, and their death Had on it still the tender dew of birth. We were so near the sweet warm wells of life We lay and laughed in bosom of the dawn And knew not if the noon had heat to burn Or the evening rain to smite us; being grown tall, Our heads were raised more near the fires of heaven And bitter strength of storms; then we were glad, Ay, glad and good. Is there yet one of you Keeps in her mind what hovers now in mine, That sweet strait span of islanded green ground Where we played once, and set us flowers that died Before even our delight in them was dead? Now we are old, delights are first to die Before the things that breed them. Mary Seyton (aside). She roams yet. Mary Beaton. I do remember. Queen. Yea, I knew it; one day We wrangled for a rose' sake and fell out With tears and words protesting each 'twas she, She 'twas that set it; and for very wrath I plucked up my French lilies and set foot On their gold heads, because you had chafed me, saying Those were her flowers who should be queen in France, And leave you being no queen your Scottish rose With simpler leaves ungilt and innocent That smelt of homelier air; and I mind well I rent the rose out of your hand and cast Upon the river's running; and a thorn Pierced through mine own hand, and I wept not then, But laughed for anger at you and glad heart To have made you weep, being worsted. What light things Come back to the light brain that sickness shakes And makes the heaviest thought that it can hold No heavier than a leaf, or gossamer That seems to link two leaves a minute, then A breath unlinks them; so my thoughts are: nay, And should not so; it may be I shall die, And as a fool I would not pass away With babbling lips unpurged and graceless heart Unreconciled to mercy. Let me see That holy lord I bade be not far off While I lay sick—I have not here his name— My head is tired, yet have I strength at heart To say one word shall make me friends with God, Commending to him in the hour of unripe death The spirit so rent untimely from its house And ere the natural night lay hold on it Darkly divided from the light of life. Pray him come to me. Mary Beaton. It is my lord of Ross The queen would see? my lord is at her hand. Enter the Bishop of Ross. Queen. Most reverend father, my soul's friend, you see How little queenlike I sit here at wait Till God lay hand on me for life or death, With pain for that gold garland of my head Men call a crown, and for my body's robe Am girt with mortal sickness: I would fain, Before I set my face to look on death, Mine eyes against his eyes, make straight the way My soul must travel with this flesh put off At the dark door; I pray you for God's grace Give me that holy help that is in you To lighten my last passage out of sight. For this world's works, I have done with them this day, With mine own lips while yet their breath was warm Commending to my lords the natural charge Of their born king, and by my brother's mouth To the English queen the wardship of her heir, And by the ambassador's of France again To his good mistress and my brother king The care of mine unmothered child, who has No better friends bequeathable than these: And for this land have I besought them all, Who may beseech of no man aught again, That here may no man for his faith be wronged Whose faith is one with mine that all my life I have kept, and fear not in it now to die. Bishop of Ross. Madam, what comfort God hath given his priests To give again, what stay of spirit and strength May through their mean stablish the souls of men To live or die unvexed of life or death, Unwounded of the fear and fang of hell, Doubt not to have; seeing though no man be good But one is good, even God, yet in his eye The man that keeps faith sealed upon his soul Shall through the bloodshedding of Christ be clean. And in this time of cursing and flawed faith Have you kept faith unflawed, and on your head The immediate blessing of the spouse of God. Have no fear therefore but your sins of life, Or stains and shadows such as all men take, In this world's passage, from the touch of time, Shall fall from off you as a vesture changed And leave your soul for whiteness as a child's. Queen. I would have absolution ere I die, But of what sins I have not strength to say Nor hardly to remember. I do think I have done God some service, holding fast Faith, and his Church's fear; and have loved well His name and burden set on me to serve, To bear his part in the eye of this thwart world And witness of his cross; yet know myself To be but as a servant without grace Save of his lord's love's gift; I have sinned in pride, Perchance, to be his servant first and fight, In face of all men's hate and might, alone, Here sitting single-sceptred, and compel For all its many-mouthed inveteracy The world with bit and bridle like a beast Brought back to serve him, and bound down to me Whose hand should take and hale it by the mane And bend its head to worship as I bade, I, first among his faithful; so I said, And foolishly; for I was high of heart; And now, behold, I am in God's sight and man's Nothing; but though I have not so much grace To bind again this people fast to God, I have held mine own faith fast and with my lips Have borne him witness if my heart were whole. Bishop of Ross. Therefore shall he forget not in your hour Nor for his child reject you; and shall make The weight and colour of your sins on earth More white and light than wool may be or snow. Queen. Yea, so my trust is of him; though as now Scarce having in me breath or spirit of speech I make not long confession, and my words Through faintness of my flesh lack form; yet, pray you, Think it but sickness and my body's fault That comes between me and my will, who fain Would have your eye look on my naked soul And read what writing there should be washed out With mine own heart's tears, and with God's dear blood, Who sees me for his penitent; for surely My sins of wrath and of light-mindedness, And waste of wanton will and wandering eyes, Call on me with dumb tongues for penitence; Which I beseech you let not God reject For lack of words that I lack strength to say. For here as I repent and put from me In perfect hope of pardon all ill thoughts, So I remit all faults against me done, Forgive all evil toward me of all men, Deed or device to hurt me; yea, I would not There were one heart unreconciled with mine When mine is cold; I will not take death's hand With any soil of hate or wrath or wrong About me, but being friends with this past world Pass from it in the general peace of love. Mary Beaton. Here is some message from the world of friends Brought to your brother: shall my lord come in? Queen. What lord? ye have no lord of any man While I am lady of all you. Who is this? Message? what message? whence? Enter Murray. Murray. From Edinburgh, Your husband new alighted in sharp speed Craves leave of access to your majesty. Queen. By heaven, I had rather death had leave than he. What comes he for? to vex me quick or dead With his lewd eyes and sodden sidelong face That I may die again with loathing of him? By God, as God shall look upon my soul, I will not see him. Bid him away, and keep Far off as Edinburgh may hold him hence Among his fellows of the herded swine That not for need but love he wallows with To expend his patrimony of breath and blood In the dear service of dishonouring days. Murray. Let him but bide the night here. Queen. Not an hour; Not while his horse may breathe. I will not see him. Murray. Nay, for the world's sake, and lest worse be said; Let him sleep here and come not in your sight. Queen. Unless by some means I be freed of him I have no pleasure upon earth to live. I will put hand to it first myself. My lord, See how this ill man's coming shakes my soul And stains its thoughts with passionate earth again That were as holy water, white and sweet, For my rechristening; I could weep with wrath To find between my very prayer and God His face thrust like a shameful thought in sleep. I cannot pray nor fix myself on heaven But he must loose my hold, break up my trust, Unbind my settled senses, and pluck down My builded house of hope. Would he were dead That puts my soul out of its peace with God. Comfort me, father; let him not have way; Keep my soul for me safe and full of heaven As it was late.—See that you rid him hence, I charge you, sir, with morning. Murray. Yea, I shall; 'Twere best he saw you not. Queen. I think so. Hark! Who is there lighted after him? I heard— Nay, he is sick yet, wounded; yet I heard— Pray God he be not risen too soon, to ride With his wound's danger for my sickness' sake. Mary Beaton. It is my lord the warden. Queen. What, I knew it— So soon so far, and with such speed! ay, never Had queen so ill befriended of her own So fast a friend and loving. I will see him; I am stronger than I was. Give me your hands; I can stand upright surely. Come you in And help to attire me like a living queen; These are as grave-clothes. One go bring me word How he looks now, if weak or well indeed; If stout of cheer or tired. Say, for his coming And care unbidden of me, I thank him not If he have done his own wound hurt thereby. I will but rest, and see him: bring me in. [Exeunt. Scene X. —Craigmillar. The Queen, Murray, Bothwell, Maitland, Huntley, and Argyle. Queen. If it must be, or all without it break, I am content to have Lord Morton home; Nay, all of them ye will, save two I keep To be the food of justice and my wrath, Now hunger-starven; his red hand who set To my child-burdened breast the iron death, And the uncle of my caitiff; they shall bleed, As Ruthven should, but for death's hastier hand That plucked him up before me: for his son, Let him come back too. Maitland. It is nobly judged, And shall content the lords and land alike With such good counsel and such fair consent To see your highness moved to rid yourself Of their disease and yours, with all men's will Purged from you by the readiest mean we may. Queen. Ay, by divorce: I have then your tongues to that, Yours, both my friends now that were ill friends once But handfast here in common faith to me And equal-hearted; and my brother's voice, Joined with these good lords present: but you said, Was it not you said, sir, that by divorce, Though leave were given of them that might withhold, And the priest's word that bound unbound us, yet Some soil might fall from lips of evil will On our son's birth-name? Maitland. Yea, from ill men's mouths And all that hate you such rebuke might fall, Which were foul shame to suffer and be dumb, Though made by your divorce unanswerable. Queen. In sooth, I thought so; and howbeit yourself, My lord of Bothwell, by the judgment given That loosed your mother's from your father's hand Stood undespoiled in fair inheritance, It may be where the cast is of a crown, And such a crown as in contention shakes Two several-storied kingdoms, even the chance Should stand not questionable; and friend nor foe Have word to throw against it. Maitland. So I said. Bothwell. Yet must the queen be freed; and for the fear Lest England for his sake be moved, I know not What hold it has upon us, who but now Saw what good heart and loyal will they bear To the right heirship of your majesty Who bide on our south border, when their guns From Berwick hailed you passing hither, and made The loud mouthed crags cry to their batteries back, And tell the sundering Tweed and all green hills, And all the clamorous concourse of the sea, The name that had the lordship of both lands In heritage to bind them fast in one. There heart and tongue outspake of the true north That for his caitiff sake should not be moved Nor alter from its faith though he were cast, With haltered throat or millstone round his neck, From a queen's bed into the naked sea. Maitland. Madam, we are here for service of your grace, Chief of your council and nobility: We shall find mean whereby without wrong done To your son's title, you shall well be quit Of your ill-minded husband; and albeit My lord of Murray present here be one As scrupulous of his faith a Protestant As is your grace a Papist, he will look As through his fingers on the work we do And say no word, I am well assured, of all His eye may wink on. Queen. Nay, I cannot tell; I would not have mine honour touched, nor buy My peace with hurt of conscience; being so wise As silence proves you or as speech proclaims, Ye shall do well to let this be; perchance The good ye mean me being untimely done Might turn to my displeasure, and your hands Leave me more hurt than holpen. Murray. You say well; For none but honourable and lawful ends Have I desired this council, to procure Your just and honest freedom, and repeal The banished Morton, whose advice thereto Shall not be fruitless; for no further aim To no strange mean have I put hand. Farewell. [Exit. Argyle. He will not know of us enough to thwart; And so not least may serve us; but if here These hands whose help would hurt you not be set To such a bond as may put forth our cause And bind us to sustain it with one soul, Shall they more hurt than help you? Queen. Nay, ye are wise; I know not; but I think your helpful hands Could not be set but to my service. Huntley. Then Should we set down what reason of resolve We have to make it manifest and sure That this young fool and tyrant by our will Shall bear no rule among us, and thereto For divers causes shall he be put forth One way or other, and what man soe'er Shall take this deed in hand or do it, all we Shall as our own and general act of all Defend and fortify it. Queen. Must all set hands To one same bond for warrant? Bothwell. Who should fail? Not we that shall devise it, nor Balfour, My kinsman here and friend. Queen. Must you sign too? Bothwell. How must I not? am I not fit to serve As being or coward or faithless or a fool, Or all or any? or what misdoubt of yours Should wash my writing out or blur my name? What faith a faithful servant of his hands May freely challenge of the king they serve, So much I challenge of your majesty. Queen. Nay, my fair lord, but for your known faith's sake And constant service the less need it were To have your hand here on our side; lest men Should lay the deed but on mine ancient friends, Whose names not all men love yet for my sake, And call it but our privy plot and hate Which is the judgment of all wisest lords And equal sentence of the general land. Maitland. So we that were not counted with your friends Should bear the whole deed and its danger up, We whom you have loved not, madam, for the stand We made against the perilous loves and hates That loosened half your people's love from you. Yet must we have his hand too. Bothwell. Ay, and shall. I wear no glove when hands are bared to strike. Queen. Be it as you will; I am nothing in your count; So be it; my council shall not cumber you. Do all ye list. Maitland. And all that shall be done Will be the more strength to your majesty And comfort to your cause: which now we go With all our help to hearten. Queen. Go, and thrive. [Exeunt Maitland, Huntley, and Argyle. I would we had no need of such men's tongues. Bothwell. He has the wisest name on all their side; And by the tether that holds fast his faith We lead their lesser wits what way we will. Sharp-spirited is he surely, deep of soul, Cunning and fearless; one that gives, men say, Small heed or honour to their faiths or fears And breath of holy custom; undistraught By doubt of God's hand paddling in our clay Or dream of God's eye slanted on our sin; As one that holds more worthily of God, —Or would not hold at all—whate'er he be, Than of a sidelong scrupulous overseer That pries askance upon our piteous lives To judge of this and this, how ill or well, And mark souls white or black with coal or chalk For crowning or for burning, palms or fires; One therefore that through all shut ways of life Lets his soul range, even like the all-winnowing wind, And ply her craft in all life's businesses Not like a blind man burdened; sure of hand And great of counsel, like an under fire That works in the earth and makes its breach by night And leaps a league's length at the first stride forth Of its free foot, blackening the face of men; So strong and keen and secret is his soul. Queen. So he keep trust, I care not if his creed Be faced or lined with craft and atheism, His soul be close or open; but what bond Shall bind him ours so sure that fraud nor force May serve against us more? Bothwell. Doubt me not that; By hilt, not edge, we hold him as a sword That in our hand shall bend not till we break, If we would break it when our work is done. Queen. Have we the strength? I doubt not of this hand, That holds my heart, if it be strong or no, More than I doubt of the eyes that light mine eyes, The lips that my lips breathe by—O my life, More than I doubt of mine own bitter love, More than of death's no power to sunder us, Of his no force to quench me who am fire, Fire for your sake, that would put all these out To shine and lighten in your sight alone For warmth and comfort, being to all eyes beside Or fear or ruin more fleet of foot than fear. I would I had on breast or hand or brow In crown or clasp the whole gold wrought of the earth, In one keen jewel the store of all the sea, That I might throw down at your hand or foot Sea, land, and all that in them is of price, Or in the strong wine of my piercing love Melt the sole pearl of the earth, and drink dissolved The cost of all the world's worth. Bothwell. Yea, my queen? Have then no fear what man shall deem or do; For by this fire and light of you I swear That is my sunlight and my fire of day We shall not walk as they that walk by night Toward our great goal uncertainly, nor swerve Till we strike foot against it. Kiss me now, And bid me too speed on my way with them To bring back all their hands here to the bond Set fast as mine, or as your heart is fast Set on his death whose life lies nigh burnt out, Half brand half ash already in the heat Of that bright wrath which makes as red as flame Your fearful and sweet splendour; nay, by heaven, It flushes all the light about your face With seven times kindled colour of pure fire, And burns mine eyes beholding, as your lips And quick breath burn me kissing. My sweet fear, Had you not been the sweetest, even to me You must have been the fearfullest thing alive. Queen. For love is so, and I am very love, And no more queen or woman; have no heart, No head, no spirit or sense at all of life, Save as of love that lives and that is I, I that was woman, and bore rule alone Upon myself; who am all diskingdomed now, Made twice a slave, mine own soul's thrall and yours Who wield the heart that wields me at your will. I can but do as wills the spirit in me Which is your spirit's servant. Ah, my lord, My one lord every way, my poor heart's blood, Breath of my lips and eyesight of mine eyes, How did I live the life that loved you not? What were those days wherein I walked apart And went my way and did my will alone And thought and wrought without you in the world? Then I did evil and folly; the more need I purge me now and perfect my desire, Which is to be no more your lover, no, But even yourself, yea more than body and soul, One and not twain, one utter life, one fire, One will, one doom, one deed, one spirit, one God; For we twain grown and molten each in each Surely shall be as God is and no man. Bothwell. God speed us then till we grow up to God! Me first, who first shall clear our way to climb By carving one weed's earthly coil away That cumbers our straight growing: pray for me! I will have all their hands to it in an hour. Scene XI. —Courtyard of a Hostelry at Whittingham. Bothwell and Morton. Morton. Fled in pure fear of me? well, he knows best. Towards Glasgow, said you? Bothwell. Soon as came the word You were brought home with welcome of the queen, He spurs from Stirling with all heat of speed Even from her arms new-reconciled and face That favourably had received him; leaves the feast Half made and his unchristened yeanling there Not yet signed God's and dewy from the font Long waited for, till the English golden gift Was grown too strait to hold and hallow him; Flies from all sight and cheer of festal folk, And on the way being smitten sick with fear Cries out of poison working in his flesh Blue-spotted as with ulcerous pestilence, Weeps himself dead and wails himself alive, As now he lies, but bedrid; and has lain This Christmas through, while the queen held her feast At Drummond Castle. Morton. Yea, I heard so; and you At Tullibardine likewise, or men lie, Kept the feast high beside her. Well, my lord, Now have you time and room to say for each What ye would have of me, the queen and you, Who are hand and tongue at once of her design; Here am I newly lighted, hot from horse, But fresh come forth of exile and ill days To do you service; let me have her hand For warrant of what dangerous work she will, And mine is armed to do it; but till I have, Expect of me, who have seen times strange as this, Nothing. Bothwell. I have her warrant in my lips; By me she speaks you safe in serving her. Morton. Let that secure yourself; I must have proofs. Bothwell. You shall have all, and written; but your hand Must be in this with ours. Morton. I have cause enough, Good reason and good will to see it performed; But will not strike through mine own side at him. Make your mind sure of that. Bothwell. Well, you shall have it; Myself will fetch your warrant from her hand That from my mouth assures you not; and then— Morton. Then shall my hand make answer to her own. [Exeunt. Scene XII. —Callander. The Queen and Lady Reres. Queen. I do not feel as at past partings; then My heart was sick and bitter, and mine eye Saw not beyond the grievous hour at hand; Now when of all time I should be most sad, Being parted at love's highest of height from love And bound to meet love's poison and my plague, My life's live curse yet married to my life, Yet am I light and fuller of sweet hope Than even sweet memory fills me. Lady Reres. It is well When dawn discomforts not the whole sweet night. Queen. There be stars sure that die not of the day, Or in this hoariest hour of dusk and dew How should my heart be warm with last night's fire? Enter Bothwell. What, risen so soon, my lord? Bothwell. What, not yet forth? That was the question laughing on your lips, And this my plea to kill the question with. (Kissing her.) I must ride now. There waits a messenger From our wed lord in Glasgow. Queen. Ay? would God He had slipt his saddle and borne his charge to hell! Must we part here? I ask but what I know, Only to have a breath more of your mouth, A smile more of your eye, turn of your head, Before you kiss and leave me. Why should love, That can change life, seat and disseat the soul In heaven or hurl it hellward, break and build, Root and unroot the very springs o'the heart, Have not the force to pluck but twelve hours back, And twice consume and twice consummate life, Twice crowned and twice confounded? I would give All but love's self, all hope and heat of life, But to have over this scant space again, Since yesterday saw sunset. Bothwell. You shall win A better prayer than this; for one poor hour Caught from the gripe of all good-grudging time, An hundredfold in long-lived happiness, Secure and scathless of all change or fear. Queen. Yet this joy waited on by fear and doubt, Plucked casually, a flower of accident, On the rough lip and edge of danger's breach, How sweeter is it than the rose to smell We gather from our garden with gloved hand, And find nor thorn nor perfume! You must go, And I part hence; yet all through life and death I shall have mind of this most gracious place, Poor palace of all pleasure, where I found Brief harbourage in long travel of my life. Now take farewell of me. Bothwell. Fair lips, farewell, And love me till we kiss again and sleep. [Exit. Queen. So may my last sleep kiss me at your lips, And find me full of you as heaven of light When my time comes of slumber.—Bid this man Come in that waits: he shall bear word of me Before I stand in his lord's sight again. Enter Crawford. What message from our lord your master, sir? Crawford. Madam, with all his heart my lord commends His heart's excuses to your majesty For the great grief and doubt wherein it stands Of your unstanched displeasure; of which fear He lies soul-sick, and sends that heart by me To crave its pardon of you, and for grace From your dread lips some comfortable word That may assure him who now lives in pain Through the evil news he hears from all winds blown, In all mouths open; whence as one distraught, And knowing not how to bear himself secure Or dare put forth to meet you, for the words He hears you have said, though fain, I know, to come And clear himself of aught that you suspect By present inquisition—this I know, Though now he laid no charge on me to say— He hath writ you word already of his grief, And finds no answer but of bitter sound, Nor any light of pity from your face, Nor breath of healing; wherefore on my knees He kneels before you to require his doom. Queen. I have no remedy for fear; there grows No herb of help to heal a coward heart. Fears were not rank were faults not rank in him. Crawford. It is no caitiff doubt that pleads with you, No rootless dread sprung of a craven mood That bows him down before your highness' foot To take the sovereign sentence of your eye And bide and bear its judgment given as God's: He knows, he says, by proof and speech of men What cause he has what friends of yours to fear. Queen. What, must I ride alone to comfort him? Tell him he may sleep sure then though I come; Lord Bothwell is bound back to Edinburgh; There is no man to affright him in my train But grooms and lacqueys; and for all I hear He never feared my women. Crawford. Please it you, My master doth but wish all hearts of men Were on their faces written with their faith. Queen. Hath he no more than this, our lord, to say? Then let him hold his peace; and bear him word That of our grace we come to cherish him With not a man's face to procure his dread. Tell him so much and bid him keep good heart, If heart he have, even for my sake who swear He shall not long live in this fear of me. Scene XIII. —Darnley's Lodging in Glasgow. Darnley on a couch, as sick; Crawford in attendance. Darnley. She is come in then? Crawford. Presently she comes. Darnley. You found her yet more sharp of eye than tongue? Crawford. Ay. Darnley. Would I had but strength to bring myself Forth of this land where none will pity me, No, not the least of all you, though I die. Who comes with her? what household? I would speak With Joachim her French fellow there, to know Why she should come—you cannot show me—ay And if for good—and if they come with her, Her outland folk and Bothwell's—or at least If she have mind yet to send off or no Joseph, her dead knave's brother? Are you sure Himself shall come not? wherefore being come in Should she not lodge beside me? Nay, I hear More than she wots of, and have spies that see What counsels breed among the crew of them. What talk was that of marriage that should be Between her fiddler and no maid of hers, To what fair end? Would God I might take ship, I would make speed for England; there at least They durst not lay their nets about my life: Here every wind that blows hath smells of blood. I am lost and doomed; lost, lost. Crawford. Have better thoughts. Take hope to you, and cheer. Darnley. Ay, ay, much cheer! Ye are all in one to abuse me, snare and slay— Ye are all one heart to hate, one hand to smite; I have none to love nor do me good, not one, One in the world's width, of all souls alive. I am dead and slain already in your hearts: By God, if ever I stand up strong again, I will be even with all you. Doth she think I fear her? there is none that lives I fear. What said she to you? Crawford. With her last breath she said You should no longer live in fear of her. Darnley. Why, so I do not: nay, nor ever did. Let her come now and find I fear her not, What shall she say? (Without) Make way there for the queen. Enter the Queen, attended. Queen. How is it with our lord? Darnley. Ill is it, ill, Madam, and no lord but your servant here. Will you not kiss me? Queen. Nay, you are sick indeed. Let me sit here, and give me but your hand. I have a word with you to speak for love, And not for chiding. Darnley. I beseech you, no: I have no force to hear man's chiding now, Being sick, and all my sickness is of you, That look so strange and heavily on me; Howbeit I could now die, I am made so glad, For very joy to see you; if I die, Look, I leave all things to your only will, And of my pure love make no testament, Nor lay no charge on any else for love. Queen. I will rebuke you not but tenderly, As a right wife and faithful woman; sir, What word was that you wrote me, and wherein And wherefore taxing some for cruelty, Of what suspicion misconceived and born, That came forth of your hand to strike my heart? You that have found no cause, and will not say You have found or shall find ever cause of fear, So to misdoubt me—what could sting you so, What adder-headed thought or venomous dream, To make you shoot at this bared breast to you Suspicion winged and whetted with ill thoughts? What words were these to write, what doubts to breed, Of mere mistrust and stark unfriendliness? Nay, and I know not, God can witness me, So much as what you doubt or what misdeem Or wherein hold me dangerous or my friends, More than I know what source your sickness hath, Whereof I would fain think all this is bred And all ill fears grown but of feverish nights. What cause most ails you? or what think you on? Darnley. I think how I am punished—ay, God knows I am punished that I made my God of you. What should I mean of cruelty but yours That will not look on my sore penitence For my least sin, as God would look on all? Though I confess wherein I have failed indeed, Yet never in worse kind than was avowed, And many a man for such revolt as mine Hath had your pardon; in this kind I have sinned, Not in such wise as ever I denied, And am yet young; and though you should cast up How often being forgiven I have gone back And fallen in fresh offence of you that late Forgave me, may not any twice or thrice So slip that is none older than I am, Or slack his promise plighted, yet in the end, Repenting, by experience be chastised? If my weak years and grief may get but grace, I swear I never shall make fault again; And this is all, and honest, that I crave, To have again my wife to bed and board, Which if I may not by consent of you Out of this bed I never will rise more. I pray you tell me whereof you resolve, That I may die or live, who have no thought But only of you; and at such luckless time As ever I offend you, even the offence Grows of yourself; for when I am wronged or wroth If I for refuge might complain to you Of any that offends me, I would speak Into no ear but yours; but being estranged, What now soe'er I hear, necessity Binds me to keep it in my breast, and hence I am moved to try my wit on mine own part For very anger. Now, being at your foot, Will you forgive me? that for love indeed And fear of you have trespassed, being so young, And had no good man's counsel, and no guard, No light, no help, no stay,—was yet scarce man, And have so loved you whom I sinned against. Queen. Why would you pass in the English ship away? Darnley. I swear by God I never thought thereon; I spake but with the men; but though I had, I might have well ta'en hold on such a thought, To hear much less things than the least I heard. Queen. What inquisition was it that you made To hear such things as fright you? Darnley. Nay, by heaven, I have made none; I never sought man out To speak with any; I swear I see no spies. Queen. Must I return to your own ear again The very words were spoken? Darnley. I did hear There was a letter brought you to subscribe By certain of the council, to the intent I should be cast in prison, and with power To slay me by your warrant, should I make Resistance; Highgate said so; I confess I spake with him; my father that first heard Brought him to speech of me. Queen. Spake he so much? But Walcar, that at Stirling brought me word Of this man's speeches here, had heard of him That you with certain of our lords had laid A plot to take our son, and having crowned Reign for him king of Scots; whereon the man Being had before our council with good speed Swore he knew no such tale, and had but heard Some rumour blown of your imprisonment, But nothing of your slaying; to which again His witness summoned gave him straight the lie. Yet would I not conceive the tale for true That being incensed with some our loyal lords Who were not of the faction that should lay Such regency upon you for your son, You had threatened them aloud with wrath to come; What say you to it? Darnley. I say you do me wrong To speak to me of him that as you say Belied me to you; who saith so of me lies, And I will pluck his ears from off his head, The knave whose tongue so misdelivers me. And I beseech you think he lies that saith I would be wroth with any man your friend, Or would not rather give away my life Than by despite toward such displease you; yet I have heard strange things here of a trustier tongue; The Laird—you know him—of Minto, my fast friend, If any friend be fast on earth to me, He told me to what bond what hands were set; Yea, and more hands than those that signed me dead, He swore, were set to slay me; but God knows I gave no faith to it—would not dream or doubt You could devise, that were my proper flesh, To do me any evil; nay, I said It was well seen you would not, by their writ Against my life that you subscribed not; else, Could I think once you hungered for my death, God knows I would not hold you hungering long, But make mine own throat naked for your knife As readily as your hand could pluck it forth: Howbeit the best man of mine enemies else Should buy me dear—ay, any of all but you, Except he took me sleeping; as indeed Were now not hard to take me: had I but A hand to help my heart, and health to go, A foot to stand against them, God and you, Madam, should oversee us and judge; but now You see what power I have, what hope of help, What strength to serve my will and my best heart Lies in my broken body; ay, these know that, What force is left to second my good will They know who durst not else devise or do, Had I the natural might yet of my limbs, What now—but you, if you have pity of me, Seeing me how faint I am and how sore sick, And cannot eat for weakness, though I faint, That makes me loathe my meat—but will you not Feed me, and kiss me? surely I could live, Being quickened of your hands and piteous lips, So sweet you are and strong and large of life. Nay, do but kiss me once though I must die, Be it but lest all men say you loved me not. Queen. I have a pain here takes me in my side— I pray you—where my sickness left it sore, And liable to swift pains yet—pardon me. Darnley. 'Tis I you cannot pardon, I, woe's me, You cannot love or pardon; but I swear, So be it you will not leave me, I will go, So but I may not lose you out of sight, Borne in a litter, such as here I lie, So weak, so full of sickness, where you will, Be it to Craigmillar, though death went with me, Or to the world's end, going in sight of you. Queen. Have here my hand then and my faith to it, sir, When there the healing springs have washed you whole As they shall surely, with cold cleansing streams Whose medicinal might shall bathe your veins And kill the fire that feeds upon their blood, I will once more dwell with you as your wife, In all the lovely works and ways of love And dues of duteous life and unity That man may claim of woman. Tell me now, Ere we go thither, where the leech and I May help you, nor be far off from my son, What are those lords you are wroth at? since I hear Some are there that you threaten, as in doubt Their minds are bitter toward you; shall I say You stand in fear of Maitland? Darnley. Him? not I— I pray you speak not of him for my sake— I stand in fear of no man; I beseech you, Speak me not of him; I will see no man, To be our makebate and your talebearer; I have heard too of your brother, how he says I spake with him at Stirling, where I swear I came not in his chamber, spake not half Of all whereof he has rounded in your ear That I made plaint to him concerning you; For all my faults are published in your eye, And I deny not one, and nought put off; What should it boot me to deny my speech? But there are they that think the faults they make Shall to all time lie still unspoken of, Yet will they speak aloud of small and great And tax alike all faults of other folk, The least fault as the worst, in men like me That have not craft to hide or most or least; God save you from such friendship: it is thought, Through power upon you of such evil tongues, Yourself have not your power upon yourself, As by your slight still of my proffered love I would believe you have not; such a friend Rode with you hither—or unfriend as I doubt— I like her not—the Lady Reres, your friend; I pray God she may serve you, if she be, To your own honour; it runs through all men's mouths She was Lord Bothwell's harlot, who stands marked For a lewd liver above all men alive; She and her sister both lie side by side Under the like report of his rank love— Foul concord and consent unsisterlike In such communion as beasts shun for shame. Nay, for you know it, it lives on common lips, Cries from all tongues, you know it; but for my part I will love all that love you, though they were But for that love's sake shameful in men's eyes. Why will you wake not with me this one night, But so soon leave me, and I sleep so ill? Queen. Nay, though this night I may not watch with you, I leave you not till you turn back with me; But for the lords' sake must it not be known That if you change not purpose ere that time When you are whole we shall be one again; Lest when they know it, remembering your loud threat To make them find, if ever we agreed, What small account they had made of you, and how You had counselled me to take not some of them To grace again without assent of yours, They fall in fear and jealousy, to see The scene so broken and the play so changed Without their knowledge, that contrariwise Was first set up before them. Darnley. Think you then They will for that the more esteem of you? But I am glad at heart you speak of them, And do believe now you desire indeed That we should live together in quietness; For were it otherwise, to both of us Might worse fall than we wot of; but I now Will do whatever you will do, and love All that you love; and I have trust in you To draw them in like manner to my love; Whom since I know they aim not at my life I will love all alike, and there shall be No more dissension of your friends and mine. Queen. It was by fault of you all this fell out That I must heal. For this time fare you well; When I get rest I will return again. [Exit with attendants. Darnley. What say you now? she is gentler in mine eyes Than was your word of her. Crawford. Ay, sweet to sight, Exceeding gentle. Wherefore, could one tell, Should she desire to lead you so in hand Just to Craigmillar? whence report came late Of no good counsel toward you or good hope, Except the hope be good, there to be healed Of all life's ill for ever, once being bathed In the cold springs of death: and hence meseems More like a prisoner than her wedded lord Are you borne off as in her bonds. Darnley. By heaven, I think but little less, and fear myself, Save for the trust indeed I have in her And in her promise only; howsoe'er I will go with her and put me in her hands, Though she should cut my throat; and so may God Between us both be judge. I have been men's fool That were but tongues and faces of my friends; I see by mine own sight now, and will stand On no man's feet but mine. Give me to drink; I will sleep now; my heart is healed of fear. Scene XIV. —The Queen's Apartment in the same. The Queen and Paris. Queen. Here is the letter for your lord to know I bring the man on Monday, as is writ, Hence to Craigmillar. Say too this by mouth, The Lady Reres can witness, with mine oath, I would not let him kiss me. Bid our lord, Mine and your lord, enquire of Maitland first If our past purpose for Craigmillar hold Or if the place be shifted, and send word To me that here await his will by you. Be of good speed; I say not of good trust, Who know you perfect in his trust and mine. Farewell. Paris. I am gone with all good haste I may, And here come back to serve your majesty. Hath it no further counsel or command To be my message? Queen. Tell him, night and day And fear and hope are grown one thing to me Save for his sake: and say mine hours and thoughts Are as one fire devouring grain by grain This pile of tares and drift of crumbling brands That shrivels up in the slow breath of time, The part of life that keeps me far from him, The heap of dusty days that sunder us. I would I could burn all at once away And our lips meet across the mid red flame Thence unconsumed, being made of keener fire Than any burns on earth. Say that mine eyes Ache with mine heart and thirst with all my veins, Requiring him they have not. Say my life Is but as sleep, and my sleep very life, That dreams upon him. Say I am passing now To do that office he would have me do Which almost is a traitor's; say, his love Makes me so far dissemble, that myself Have horror at it; bid him keep in mind How were it not to obey him I had rather Be dead before I did it; let him not Have ill opinion of me for this cause, Seeing he is alone the occasion of it himself, Since for mine own particular revenge I would not do it to him that I most hate; My heart bleeds at it. Say, he will not come But on condition I shall cleave to him Hereafter, and on that word given of mine Will go where I would have him go: alas, I never have deceived yet any man, But I remit me to my master's will In all things wholly; bid him send me word What I shall do, and come what may thereof I shall obey him; if some new subtler way By medicine may be thought on when I bring The man here to Craigmillar, that as yet May not this long time of himself go forth Out of the house, let him advise himself How to put this in hand: for all I find, This man I here endure to play upon Lives now in great suspicion; yet my word Hath credit with him, but not far enough For him to show me anything; but yet I shall draw forth of him what thing I will If my lord bid me be more plain with him; But I will never take delight to wrong The trust of any that puts trust in me; Yet may my lord command me in all things. And though by checks and hints of that I feared This man sometimes even touch me to the quick With words dropt of mine honour and my power On mine own self, whereby I surely know That he suspects him of the thing we wot And of his life, yet as to that last fear I need but say some three good words to him And he rejoices, and is out of doubt. He was seen never as gay of mood as now When I make show of grace and gentle heart, And puts me in remembrance of all things That may assure my faith he loves me well. Let not my love suspect me for his sake, Who take such great joy of his love-making That I come never where he is but straight I take the sickness of my sore side here, I am vexed so with it; wearied might he be, This poisonous man that gives me all this pain When I would speak of things far sweeter; yet He is marred not overmuch of form or face Though he have borne much, and his venomed breath Hath almost slain me though I sit far off. He would have had me watch with him, but I Put off the night; he says he sleeps not sound; He never spake more humbly nor more well; And if I had not proven his heart of wax And were not mine cut of a diamond Whereinto no shot ever can make breach But that which flies forth of mine own love's hand, I had almost had pity of him; but say I bid the captain of my fortressed heart Fear not; the place shall hold unto the death. And bid my love in recompense thereof Let not his own be won by that false kind That will no less strive with him for the same. I think the twain were trained up in one school, For he hath ever tear in eye, and makes Most piteous moan to arouse men's pity, yea, Humbly salutes them all, even to the least, To make their hearts soft toward him; and desires That with mine own hands I would give him meat; But let my lord, where he is, give no more trust Than I shall here. Tell him all this; and say I am in the doing here of a work I hate Past measure; and should make him fain to laugh To see me lie so well, or at the least So well dissemble, and tell him truth 'twixt hands. Say, by the flatteries I perforce must make And prayers to him to assure himself of me, And by complaint made of the men designed, I have drawn out of him all we list to know Yet never touched one word of that your lord Showed me, but only wrought by wiles; and say With two false kinds we are coupled, I and he, My love; the devil dissever us, and God Knit us together for the faithfullest pair That ever he made one; this is my faith, I will die in it. Excuse me to my lord That I writ ill last night, being ill at ease, And when the rest were sleeping was most glad To write unto him, who might no more, nor could Sleep as they did and as I would desire, Even in my dear love's arms; whom I pray God Keep from all evil and send him all repose. And being so long my letter hindered me To write what tidings of myself I would, Who had wrought before for two hours of the day Upon this bracelet I would send to him Though it be evil made for fault of time, I have had so little, and I can get no lock, Though that mine hands might end it yestereve I would not see the man; but this mean time I think to make one fairer; let him not Bring it in sight of any that was here, For all would know it, seeing it was wrought for haste In sight of them; yet might it bring some harm And may be seen if he should chance be hurt; Let him send word if he will have it, and say If he will have more gold by you, and when I shall return, and how far I may speak; For this man waxes mad to hear of him Or of my brother; and when I visit him His friends come all to be my convoy, say, And he desires me come the morn betimes And see him rise. This letter that I send, Bid my lord burn it, being so dangerous, With nought in it well said,—for all my mind Was on this craft I loath to think upon— And if it find his hand in Edinburgh, Let him soon send me word, and that I doubt Be not offended, since to doubts of him I give not o'er-great credit; but say this, That seeing to obey him, who is my dear heart's love, I spare nor honour, conscience, hazard, state, Nor greatness whatsoever, I beseech him But that he take it in good part, and not As his false brother-in-law interprets, whom I pray him give not ear to nor believe Against the faithfullest lover he ever had Or ever shall have; nor cast eye on her Whose feigned tears should not be esteemed so much Nor prized so as the true and faithful toils Which I sustain but to deserve her place: Whereto that I despite all bonds may climb, Against my nature I betray them here That may prevent me from it; God forgive me, And God give him, my only love, the hap And welfare which his humble and faithful love Desires of him; who hopes to be to him Ere long a thing new-named for recompense Of all her irksome travails. Tell him this; Say I could never stint of hand or tongue To send love to him, and that I kiss his hands, Ending; and let him think upon his love And write to her, and that oft; and read twice through Mine evil-written letter, and keep in mind All several sayings writ of the man therein. Say for delight I have to send to him I run twice over all the words I send, And that each word may fasten in his ear As in his eye, and you may witness me That hand and tongue and heart were one to send, Put all my message in your lips again That here was written. Say—I know not what; I can say nought but with my silent hands, Speak with the lips of deeds I do for him. Paris. Shall I say nothing of Lord Darnley more? Queen. Say, when I did but speak of Maitland once, His caitiff flesh quaked in each joint of him, Each limb and bone shivered; even to the feet He shook, and his shrunk eyes were stark with fright, That like a live thing shuddered in his hair And raised it ruffling from the roots for dread. Let him mark that: though coward the man be, and fool, He has wit and heart enough to know the worst Of his wrongdoing, and to what manner of man, Being fool, he did it, and discerning him Think whether his cause of dread be small or no For less or more of peril So to horse, And lose no word sent of my heart to him. Scene XV. —Kirk of Field. Enter Bothwell. Bothwell. This is the time and here the point of earth That is to try what fate will make of me. I hold here in my hand my hand's desire, The fruit my life has climbed for; day on day Have I strid over, stretching toward this prize With all my thews and spirits. I must be glad, If I could think; yet even my cause of joy Doth somewhat shake me, that my sense and soul Seem in their springs confused, even as two streams Violently mingling: what is here to do Is less now than the least I yet have done, Being but the putting once of the mere hand To the thing done already in device, Wrought many times out in the working soul. Yet my heart revels not, nor feel I now The blood again leap in me for delight That in the thought grew riotous and beat high With foretaste of possession unpossessed. Is it that in all alike fruition slacks The shrunk imagination? in all deeds The doing undoes the spirit to do, the joy Sickens, the lust is swallowed as of sand? Why, yet the stream should run of my desire Unshrunken, and no deserts drink it up, Being unfulfilled; no satiate sluggishness Gape with dry lips at the edge of the dry cup For the poor lees of longing. I am here Not royal yet, nor redder in the hand Than war has dyed me fighting; the thing done Is but for me done, since I hold it so, Not yet for him that in the doing must bleed; I that stand up to do it, and in my mind Behold across it mightier days for deeds, Should not be way-sick yet nor travel-tired Before I drink fulfilment as a wine; And here must it restore me. Enter Paris. Ha! so soon? What news of her? Paris. The queen commends to you Her best heart in this letter, and would know How yet your purpose toward Craigmillar bears, Whether to train him thither by her hand Or what choice else. Bothwell. Say, the device is changed By counsel and consent of whom she wots; Here must they come; James Balfour and myself Have waked all night to see things well begun, For that bond's sake whereto his hand was set With mine here at Craigmillar; all things now Stand apt and fit in this his brother's house To entertain the kingship of its guest; We have seen to it, Maitland with us. Paris. I was sent From the town hither, finding you set forth, But why folk wist not. Bothwell. Carry to my queen This diamond; say too I would send my heart, But that she hath already, and no need To pluck it forth and feel it in her hand. Bid her be swift as we have been for love, And the more surety quickens our design: The rest unsaid shall tarry till she come. Scene XVI. —The Queen's Lodging in Glasgow. The Queen in bed; Lady Reres and Paris attending. Queen. What was his word at parting? let it kiss Mine ear again. Paris. Being horsed, he bade me say, Madam, he would be fain for love of you To train a pike all his life-days. Queen. Please God, It shall not come to that. Ere this month die That has not half a week to live, we stand In Edinburgh together. He will go Without more word or fear; and being well hence— How looked my love? Paris. Madam, as one uplift To the height of heart and hope, though full of cares, And keen in resolution. Queen. I grow strong To hear of him. Hath he not heart enough To fill with blood a hundred of our hearts, Put force and daring, for the fear cast out, In all our veins made manlike? Prithee, Reres, Was he thus ever? had he so great heart In those dead days, such lordliness of eye To see and smite and burn in masterdom, Such fire and iron of design and deed To serve his purpose and sustain his will? Hath he not grown since years that knew me not In light and might and speed of spirit and stroke To lay swift hand upon his thought, and turn Its cloud to flame, its shadow to true shape, Its emptiness to fulness? If in sooth He was thus always, he should be by now Hailed the first head of the earth. Lady Reres. It cannot be But in your light he hath waxed, and from your love, Madam, drawn life and increase; but indeed His heart seemed ever high and masterful As of a king unkingdomed, and his eye As set against the sunrise; such a brow As craves a crown to do it right, and hand Made to hold empire swordlike, and a foot To tread the topless and unfooted hill Whose light is from the morn of majesty. Queen. When mine eye first took judgment of his face It read him for a king born: and his lips Touching my hand for homage had as 'twere Speech without sound in them that bowed my heart In much more homage to his own. Would God I could so read now in that heart I serve What thought of me moves in it, hear what word Now hangs upon those lips; if now his eye Darken or lighten toward mine unseen face, Or his ear hearken for my speech unheard. Why art thou now not with him, and again Here the same hour to tell me? I would have More messengers than minutes that divide Mine eyes from their desire, to bring me word With every breath of every change in him, If he but rest or rise; nay, might it be, Of every thought or heart-beat that makes up His inner hours of life: yet by mine own, If he so loved me, should I know them not? I will rise now and pass to see how soon We may set forth to-morrow. Lady Reres. Can it be He shall have strength? but let your highness heed That pretext be not given for knaves to say You had no care to wait on his good time, But vexed and harried him, being sick, with haste And timeless heat of travel. Queen. Fear not you: I will make means to bring him in my hand As a tame hound, and have his thanks and love For bringing him so wifelike on his way. It is the last pain I shall take for him, The last work I shall do for marriage-sake And wifehood well-nigh done with duty now. I have not much more time to serve my lord, And strife shall fall between us twain no more. Scene XVII. —Darnley's Chamber in Kirk of Field. Darnley and Nelson. Darnley. Thou hast the keys? This house is strange and chill, As chill as earth: I have slept no better here. Those two days that we halted on the way There at Linlithgow, I could see the haste That burnt in her to be in Edinburgh, And here being come she sets me in this grange, And till her chamber be made ready sleeps In Holyrood apart, and here by day Hath still by her that face I warned her from, That woman's that I spake of, plays and sings There in the garden with none else—by God, I like not aught of it. I am sick again, Sick-hearted, or my will should be a sword To sunder them. I would I were away. I have ill dreams, man. Nelson. Please your highness— Darnley. Ay! Is majesty gone out of all men's mouths? Is my state dead before me, even the name Dead of my place, then? Nelson. There is come from court Lord Robert Stuart to see your majesty. Darnley. Let him come in. Robert? he was my friend; I think he held me dear till David died: He supped with them that night. I found him once A quick-souled fellow that would quaff and kiss The glow of woman's or of wine-cup's mouth, And laugh as mine own lips that loved the like Can now no more this long time. Let him come. Enter Robert Stuart. My holy lord of Holyrood-house, good day; You find a fit man for a ghostly rede. Robert Stuart. I am glad you have a jest yet; but I come On graver foot than jesters run, my lord. Darnley. How, graver than your ghostly name? nay, then 'Tis matter for a grave-side. Robert Stuart. Sir, it may: I would be secret with you. Darnley. What, alone? Why should we talk alone? what secret? why? Robert Stuart. I will put off my sword and give it your man, If that will ease you. Darnley. Ease me? what, by God, You think I fear you come to kill me? tush, I am not the fool—and were that all, being thus, 'Faith, you might end me with your naked hands. Leave us. [Exit Nelson. What is it? you make me not afraid— Sir, I fear no man—what, for God's sake speak, I am not moved—in God's name let me have it. Robert Stuart. I came to do you such good service, sir, As none has done you better nor can do. There is an old phrase in men's mouths of one That stands between the devil and the deep sea; So now stand you; the man that toward a reef Drives naked on a thund erstricken wreck And helmless, hath not half your cause of fear; The wretch that drops plague-eaten limb from limb Crumbles to death not half so fast as you: The grave expects not the new-shrouded man More surely than your corpse now coffinless. Darnley. Who put this in your mouth? what enemy? How have you heart, or whosoe'er he be, Albeit ye hate me as the worm of hell Who never harmed you in my hapless days, To use me so? I am sick— Robert Stuart. Ay, sick to death, If you give ear not to me that am come In very mercy, seeing I called you friend, For pity's sake to save you, or at least To stretch your days out for some brief span more Of life now death-devoted. Darnley. What, so soon? God would not have it done, so young I am,— What have I done that he should give me up? So comfortless,—who hath no help of man, They say, hath God's; God help me! for God knows There is none living hath less help of man. Nay, and he must, as I have faith in God, Hang all my hope upon him,—For God's sake, Whence got you this? Robert Stuart. No matter. Darnley, At whose hand— O me, what hand! who is it shall touch me? Robert Stuart. Hark. From beneath is heard the Queen's voice, singing. Qui se fie À la vie À vau-l'eau va vers la mort; Et que l'onde Rie ou gronde, Elle entraîne loin du port. Darnley. She sings I know not what—a jesting song, A French court rhyme no graver than a flower, Fruitless of sense—this is no threat—a toy— Queen (from beneath, sings). Sur l'opale Du flot pâle Tremble un peu de jour encor; Sur la plage Au naufrage Le haut vent sonne du cor. Darnley. What is it she sings now? nay, what boots to hear? I will not hear; speak to me—pray you, speak. Queen (from beneath). La mort passe Comme en chasse, Et la foudre aboie aux cieux; L'air frissonne, La mer tonne, Le port se dérobe aux yeux. Plus d'étoile Que ne voile L'orage âpre au souffle noir; Pas de brise Qui ne brise Quelque vaisseau sans espoir. Noire et nue Sous la nue, La nef brisée à moitié Tourne et vire Où l'attire La sombre mer sans pitié. La nuit passe, Et la chasse S'est éteinte au fond des cieux; Mais l'aurore Pleure encore Sur les morts qu'ont vus ses yeux. Ce qui tombe Dans la tombe Coule et s'en va sans retour; Quand sous l'ombre Plonge et sombre Ou la vie ou bien l'amour. Robert Stuart. Why do you shake and hide your eyes? take heart; Let fear not be more swift to slay than hate. Darnley. I said, what hand—you bade me hearken—well, What say you now she sings not? Robert Stuart. I have said. Darnley. I will not be your baiting-stock; speak plain; Whence had you word of any plot on me? Robert Stuart. If you will heed me, well; if not, for me I will take heed yet that it be not ill. Weigh how you will my counsel, I am sure If my word now lie lightly in your ear It would not lie the heavier for my oath Or any proof's assurance. Whence I had This word you have of me, I am not bound To put the knowledge into trust of you Who trust not me in asking. Darnley. What, I knew There was no plot but yours to scare me, none— Your plot to get my favour, stay yourself On me as on a staff—affright me sick With bloodred masks of words and painted plots, And so take hold upon me afterward Having my strength again and state and power— A worthy friend and timely,—Nay, but, nay, I meant not so—I am half distraught—I meant I know you for my friend indeed and true; For one thwart word in sickness cast not off Your friend that puts his trust in you, your friend That was nigh mad a minute, being sore sick And weak and full of pain and fear, and hath No friend to help and bear with him if you Will help nor bear not—by my faith and life I do believe you love me, and in love Came, and in faith to me—if I believe not God give me death at once and hell to boot. I pray you pardon. Robert Stuart. Sir, your faith and life Have neither weight enough to poise an oath As now they hang in balance. If you will, Take to your heart my words; if not, be sure It shall not grieve me though you trust me not, Who never think to give you counsel more. [Exit. Darnley. Nay, but one word—how would you have me fly? He goes and mocks me—would my hands had strength To dig his heart out for my dogs to feed! He flies and leaves me weaponless alone In the eye of peril, coward and false heart— Should not the tongue be false too? If he came To affright me only with a fearful face, Blow but a blast of danger in mine ear, And make my faith as wax that in his breath Might melt and be reshapen of his hands— Nay, I will see the queen, and in her eye Read if his tongue spake truth, and from her lips Draw forth his witness; if she mean me ill I cannot now but see it. Nelson!—She hath No trick to keep her from mine instant sight, Knows not his errand to me; and at once I take her unawares and catch her soul Naked, her mind plain to me, good or ill. Queen (sings from below). Lord Love went Maying Where Time was playing, In light hands weighing Light hearts with sad; Crowned king with peasant, Pale past with present, Harsh hours with pleasant, Good hopes with bad; Nor dreamed how fleeter Than Time's swift metre, O'er all things sweeter How clothed with power, The murderess maiden Mistrust walks laden With red fruit ruined and dead white flower. Darnley. What sting is in that song to smite my heart And make the blood and breath come short in me? O God, I know it—his last year's song of death— They struck it on his lips who struck him through. Nelson! I will not see her—I will not die— Enter the Queen. Queen. I heard your call from under and came in— What ails you, sir? why stare you thus askance? Darnley. I had a pang of sickness that passed by While you were singing. Queen. Is my brother gone? Darnley. There was none here—your brother? what, the earl? Doth not his wife lie at St. Andrew's sick, Where he is gone to visit her? Queen. For love, Why will you lie to me in jest? you know Here was my brother Robert. Darnley. Ay, but now— I did not say he was not here but now. Queen. Has he not moved you? Darnley. Why should I be moved? I am not lightly shaken of men's breath; What think you that he came to move me for? Queen. In faith, I guess not. Darnley. Nay, though I be weak, I am no reed yet for him to blow and make What music of me shall best please his mouth. Queen. I think you are not, but for all winds blown Of fears and threats fixed and unshakeable. What said he to you that has moved you not? Darnley. Nothing. Queen. What, you were moved then of his words? Darnley. I say I was not. Queen. He said nothing then? You held discourse but of days foul or fair, Skies wet or dry, seasons and accidents, All things and nothing? Darnley. Would you not know that? Queen. Even as you list or list not, so would I. Darnley. What if it please me you should know this not? Queen. Why, you do wisely, seeing I love you not. Darnley. I did not say so; I may hold my peace, Yet not for doubt that irks me of your love. Queen. Surely you may; good reasons may stand thick As buds in April in your judgment's sight To cover both your counsels from mine eye That has no lust to invade your secrecies. Darnley. And if it please me show it, as now it shall, You will not dread I doubt your love of me. Queen. I have not heart to dread the doubt I know You have not heart to harbour of my love. Darnley. Why, he came here to warn me of my life. Queen. Your life? Darnley. Ay, mine; and what now say you to him? Queen. I say he spake as your good friend and mine. Darnley. Ay? Queen. What more kindness could be shown of man Than in your ear to warn me of your life If it so stand in peril? Darnley. What, you think He told it me to have me tell it you? Queen. It was done gently, brother-like, for fear The word of danger being first heard by me Should strike too sharp upon my slighter soul And pierce my woman's sense with such quick pangs As might dethrone my judgment, shake my wits To feminine confusion, and by force Disable my swift thoughts, now maimed with dread, From their defence and office; he did well And my heart thanks him, showing you first his fear, Who are manlike of your mood and mould of mind And have but for your own life to take thought, Not for one dearer; as, I know you well, By mine own heart I know, to have heard of me Endangered would have killed your heart with fear, That in your personal peril beats at ease With blood as perfect as I see you now, With pulse thus changeless and with cheek thus calm. Indeed I thank him for it, and twice I thank, That he would serve you and would scare not me. Where said he was this danger? Darnley. Nay, by God, That would he not say; that I nothing know; Save by some hint of shoulder or writhed lip That seemed to shoot at you; and when you sang He bade me hearken, and would speak no more. Queen. At me! but if such fire be on his tongue, It should be forked and set on fire of hell. At me! but if he be not mad, to you He shall approve it, instant face to face, Eye to confronted eye, word against word, He shall maintain or mark himself for liar, With his own fire and iron brand the brow That burned not to belie me. Darnley. Sweet, not here— Would I could fight with him! but being o'erthrown Of my disease already, to what end Should he come back now save to insult on me Who have no hand to strike at him again In championship of you? Queen. He shall come back, And twice shall oversay the word he said In your own ear, or else unswear it. What, Shall I be put to shame of mine own blood, To mine own lord in mine own love maligned, Stricken with slanderous fangs of speech, and stabbed In my heart's core of honour, yet lie still And bleed to death dumb and dishonourable? Rather let come the deadliest of my kin, Mine enemies born, and bind and burn me quick, Or ever I die thus; rather let all The false blood of my father in strange veins Be set on fire against me, and its heat Consume my fame with my frail flesh, and make My scaffold of my kingdom; rather fall My naked head beneath the mortal axe, And with my blood my name be spilt and shed, Than this charge come upon me. Darnley. You are stirred Beyond all right of reason; be not moved: You see how I believed him. Queen. And to see Is my soul's comfort; but this wound that bleeds Here in my heart's heart cannot well be stanched Till by the tongue that smote me, as men say That by the anointing of the sword that hurt The wound it made finds comfort, I be healed. Darnley. Nay, let him come; I will maintain it to him, Here, to his face, he warned me of my death Or present danger in you. Queen. He shall come. But lie now down and sleep; I have wearied you. Darnley. I pray you sing me something then; indeed I am weary and would forget; but now you sang— Doth that French song break where you broke it off? Queen. No, there is more. Sleep, I will sing it you. [Sings. Sur la grève Rien ne rêve Aux naufragés de la nuit; À la trombe, Gouffre et tombe, Au flot qui frappe et qui fuit. Apaisée Et baisée Par les brises sans souci, Brille et vibre Au jour libre La belle mer sans merci. Tant que dure La nuit dure Sur la grève où rit la mort, Sous l'orage Flotte et nage Le jour qui lutte et qui sort. Pas de brume Que n'allume L'astre ou l'éclair des amours; Pas de flamme Qui dans l'âme Brûle ou luise tous les jours. À l'aurore Tout se dore, Tout se fane avant la nuit; Et que l'heure Chante ou pleure, Dans une heure tout s'enfuit. Cœur sans crainte, Œil sans feinte, Quand l'amour met voile au vent, Sur la plage Sans naufrage Est-il revenu souvent? L'ombre emporte La nef morte, Et la joie, et le beau jour; Trop profonde Était l'onde Et trop faible était l'amour. [The scene closes. Scene XVIII. —Behind Kirk of Field. Bothwell, Ormiston, Hepburn of Bolton, and Hay of Talla. Bothwell. If it be done to-morrow, we shall stand The surer that the queen slept here to-night. Cousin, bring you my knaves from Holyrood At nightfall to that hinder gate wherethrough We three shall give you passage with your charge To the strait garden-plot beyond the walls Whereto the door that opens from beneath Shall stand unbolted, and you entering spread Along the blind floor of the nether vault The train that shall set all these walls on wing. Ormiston. How said you, that his groom here had the keys? Bothwell. That under door which lets us down lacks none, There is no lock to palter with; it needs But leave the bolt undrawn; and yesterday By the queen's order was the door removed At bottom of the stair, to be instead A cover for his bath-vat; so there stands But the main door now. Hepburn of Bolton. That was well devised: She sleeps beneath his chamber here to-night? Bothwell. Ay, to the west. Hay of Talla. She has the stouter heart. I have trod as deep in the red wash o'the wars As who walks reddest, yet I could not sleep, I doubt, with next night's dead man overhead. Bothwell. We are past the season of divided wills; Where but one thought is, nothing to be done Has power to hurt the heart that holds it fast Or leave the purpose weaker by a wound Given it of doubt or afterthought: we have One thing to do, one eye to see it, one hand To pluck it from the occasion; what he wills None but a fool would mix his will to achieve With pain and fear; the mind once shaped and set That works and yet looks back and weeps to do Is but half man's; and all a man's hath she. Hepburn of Bolton. Yet woman-moulded outward, clothed upon As 'twere with feminine raiment, touched with thoughts Of female-coloured fashion, woman's craft: She sees and thinks on what could touch not us Nor graze in passing even our skirts of sense: Takes order for the hangings of his bed Whom we must kill to her hand, lest water soil The sable velvet from his bath, and bids Pluck down and save them; such slight things and strange As take the thought and hold the eye of girls Her soul, as full of great things as it is, As large and fiery, bright and passionate, Takes no less thought for, and hath heed of these No less than of high deed and deep desire Beyond where sight can scale or thought can dive Of narrower eye and shallower spirit than hers. Bothwell. Most royal is she, but of soul not all Uncurbable, nor of all shafts that fly Scathless, nor of all shots invulnerable; She had no part else and no power in us, No part in all that mingling makes up man, No power upon our earth who are earthlier made; She has the more might on men's ways of soul Not being almighty, nor from all man's moods Divided, but as passion-touched and mixed With all such moods as men are; nay, not these, But such as bear the rule of these and lead Which way they will—women's; and being so mixed She is even the more entire, more whole and strong, Herself and no self other. She nor I Live now on thoughts and words; the deed it is, Our deed alone we live by, till being done It leave us time for life that deals with these. I will be with you ere night fall again Within the town-wall; thither get you now, And doubt not of us. Ormiston. Doubt not you to find All ready by the night and need: farewell. [Exeunt all but Bothwell. Bothwell. The time is breathless; earth sees heaven as chill In the after air declining from high day. I would the winds would muster, or the sun Show half an eye-blink of his face that hangs Now downward to the sea, curbed in with cloud, And with a brief breath fire the rack that flies. Why should not flame break over Arthur's Seat This hour, and all the heaven with burning tongues Cry from the world's height to the under line That ends it for us gazing? If the sky Had speech as it hath fire, or night or day Voice to declare God's pleasure or his wrath With their dumb lips of light, from moon or sun Or the mute mouths of stars, would earth that heard Take thought and counsel of the cause, to stir Men's hearts up for our deed's sake here? I am wrought Out of myself even by this pause and peace In heaven and earth, that will not know of us Nor what we compass; in this face of things, Here in this eye of everduring life That changes not in changing, fear and hope, The life we live, the life we take, alike Decline and dwindle from the shape they held, Their import and significance; all seem Less good and evil, worth less hate and love, Than we would have them for our high heart's sake. How shall this day when all these days are done Seem to me standing where it sets my feet? Nay, whence shall I behold it? or who knows What crest or chasm, what pit or pinnacle, Shall feel my foot or gulf my body down, Bear up or break me falling? Fall or stand, At least I live not as the beasts that serve, But with a king's life or man's death at last Make all my travails perfect; and a queen, The fairest face I have loved and fieriest heart, Shines with my star or sets. Enter Paris. What sends she now? Paris. I came to know if you stand fixed indeed, Sir, for to-morrow. Bothwell. For to-morrow, man; What ails him at to-morrow? Paris. My dread lord, Nought ails me but as part of your design; But I beseech you by your trust of me, What says this while my lord of Murray? Bothwell. He! He will nor help nor hinder—but all's one. Paris. He is wise. Bothwell. But is it to tell me he is wise That you bestow your own wise tongue on me? Came you to advise me or to show my trust How cracked a casket I have closed it in Who trusted in so white a heart as yours? Paris. I have a message— Bothwell. Well, the message, then; And as you are wise, make me not wroth to-day, Who am but foolish. Paris. Sir, the queen by me Wills you to know that from her husband's mouth She is assured there came here yesterday To him her brother, Abbot of St. Cross, To warn him of some danger. Bothwell. From his mouth! Had ever mouth such hunger to eat dust? Well, it shall soon be filled and shut; what else? Paris. She has taxed hereof her brother— Bothwell. What, by word? Paris. No, but by note she let him wist she knew it. Now he denies again his word aloud— Bothwell. He does the wiselier; there your tongue struck right; She has wise men to brethren. Paris. And desires To prove it on the accuser's body, being Once whole again to meet him. Bothwell. A fair proof: Doth either sword seek mine for second? Paris. Nay; But the queen bade me tell you he should go To her lord's chamber for his challenge-sake And do that thing ye wot of. Bothwell. Tell the queen I will speak to him. We must not mar our hand; Say I will see him before the morrow morn. Howbeit, it shall be well but for a night To put our present purpose back, and see If chance or craft will mend our hand again. Who strikes most sure strikes deepest; say I go To try this brother's edge; if he be sure, He shall well serve us as a glove to wear And strike, and have the whiter hands to show. [Exeunt severally. Scene XIX. —Darnley's Chamber. Darnley and Nelson. Darnley. I never had such evil dreams as now; Save for the terror of them and after pain, I durst well swear I had not slept to-night. Nelson. You have slept seven hours. Darnley. I have been seven years in hell; Mine eyes are full yet of the flames, my flesh Feels creep the fire upon it; even my heart Is as a sere leaf shrunken. Nelson. Being awake, Let not it move you. Darnley. Nay, it shall not move. Yet were they dreams to shake with waking fear A sounder state than mine is. Nelson. Sir, what dreams? Darnley. No matter what: I'll tell thee yet some part, That thou may'st know I shrink not for no cause. I dreamed this bed here was a boat adrift Wherein one sat with me who played and sang, Yet of his cittern I could hear no note Nor in what speech he sang inaudibly, But watched his working fingers and quick lips As with a passionate and loathing fear, And could not speak nor smite him; and methought That this was David; and he knew my heart, How fain I would have smitten him, and laughed As 'twere to mock my helpless hands and hate. So drove we toward a rock whereon one sat Singing, that all the highest air of heaven Was kindled into light therewith, and shone As with a double dawn; stars east and west Lightened with love to hear her, and the sky Brake in red bloom as leaf-buds break in spring, But these bore fires for blossoms: then awhile My heart too kindled and sprang up and sang And made sweet music in me, to keep time With that swift singing; then as fire drops down Dropped, and was quenched, and in joy's stead I felt Fear ache in me like hunger; and I saw These were not stars nor overhead was heaven, But a blind vault more thick and gross than earth, The nether firmament that roofs in hell, And those hot lights were of lost souls, and this The sea of tears and fire below the world That still must wash and cleanse not of one curse The far foul strands with all its wandering brine: And as we drove I felt the shallop's sides, Sapped by the burning water, plank from plank Severing; and fain I would have cried on God, But that the rank air took me by the throat; And ever she that sat on the sea-rock Sang, and about her all the reefs were white With bones of men whose souls were turned to fire; And if she were or were not what I thought Meseemed we drew not near enough to know; For ere we came to split upon that reef The sundering planks opened, and through their breach Swarmed in the dense surf of the dolorous sea With hands that plucked and tongues thrust out at us, And fastened on me flamelike, that my flesh Was molten as with earthly fire, and dropped From naked bone and sinew; but mine eyes The hot surf seared not, nor put out my sense; For I beheld and heard out of the surge Voices that shrieked and heads that rose, and knew Whose all they were, and whence their wrath at me; For all these cried upon me that mine ears Rang, and my brain was like as beaten brass, Vibrating; and the froth of that foul tide Was as their spittle shot in my full face That burnt it; and with breast and flanks distent I strained myself to curse them back, and lacked Breath; the sore surge throttled my tongueless speech, Though its weight buoyed my dipping chin, that sank No lower than where my lips were burnt with brine And my throat clenched fast of the strangling sea, Till I swam short with sick strokes, as one might Whose hands were maimed; then mine ill spirit of sleep Shifted, and showed me as a garden walled, Wherein I stood naked, a shipwrecked man, Stunned yet and staggered from the sea, and soiled With all the weed and scurf of the gross wave Whose breach had cast me broken on that shore: And one came like a god in woman's flesh And took mine eyes with hers, and gave me fruit As red as fire, but full of worms within That crawled and gendered; and she gave me wine, But in the cup a toad was; and she said, Eat, and I ate, and Drink, and I did drink, And sickened; then came one with spur on heel Red from his horse o'erridden, smeared with dust, And took my hand to lead me as to rest, Being bruised yet from the sea-breach; and his hand Was as of molten iron wherein mine Was as a brand in fire; and at his feet The earth split, and I saw within the gulf As in clear water mine own writhen face, Eaten of worms and living; then I woke. Nelson. It was a foul and formless dream, my lord, With no soul in it. Darnley. Nay, I think it had not. And I did mind me waking how the queen Sang me a song of shipwreck, and strange seas, And love adrift by night, and fires burnt out That shine but for a song's length; I did think It was this singing made up half my dream. For there was talk of storms in it, and stars, And broken ships, and death that rode in the air: So was there in my dream. What step comes here? Enter Robert Stuart. Robert Stuart. I come to change less than a word with you, And take my leave for all your rest of life. Darnley. I will not speak alone with you again: Stay by me there. Robert Stuart. Have you not armour on? You should not sleep with sword ungirt on thigh, Lest one should fall upon you. For this time I come indeed to see if you be man Or ever knew beyond the naked name What grace and office should belong to man Or purpose to his sword. Reply not yet; I know you are sick, weak, pitiful, half dead, And with the ingrained infection of your soul Its bodily house grown rotten; all you will; You cannot swear yourself that piteous thing That I will not believe you wretcheder; No flesh could harbour such a worm alive As this thing in you taken for a soul, And 'scape corruption; but if you shall live To stand again afoot and strike one stroke For your own hand and head, you shall fight with me Or wear the lie writ red upon your face With my hand's buffet, that you spake who said I had given you note of danger from the queen. Darnley. Is it a plot, her plot upon me? Sir, By God, I never said so; what I said I have heart and sword to uphold against all swords, And kill you if I might as many times As you shall iterate on me this for true Which is most false. When I may stand and go— Robert Stuart. Yea, then shall we see fighting. But as now You can but swear you said not this of me? Darnley. I am not bound to swear it or unswear At any bidding; but so much I will— That you may see no hot foul words of yours Have quenched in me the old thought of fellowship— As swear again I said but what I might With honour and clear heart: I spake no word To bring you in suspicion, or to turn Thwart eyes upon you of men's jealousies Or cast you out of favour with the queen; I said but you did warn me of my life, As being my fast friend still, I thanked you for it— I know not what she says I said—but this I know, I spake no treason of you. See, This is a foolish wind of wrath that shakes And wrecks your faith in me, mine own in you Being firm and flawless; what you have said, you have said; And what I have spoken of you was no more Than I had right to speak and rest your friend. Robert Stuart. Will you fight with me to maintain so much? Darnley. If I might rise I would put off my state To stand against you equal; you did say it, That I was even as one the law damns dead And she was parcel of my peril. Robert Stuart. Ay! You said so to her? Darnley. She will not say I did. Robert Stuart. Plight not your faith to that; I am assured You said so, and so lied; and this last time I bind you yet to meet me on this cause Or bear the lie about you as a badge. Darnley. By God, I will grow strong to fight with you. Robert Stuart. If I shall see your living face again, It shall be as mine enemy's; foot to foot And hand to mortal hand we twain will meet, Or ere the day dawn I shall see you dead. Darnley. I am like to die, then? and your warlike words Have so much iron in them, and your heart Such daring to provoke one wellnigh dead? I wist your tongue would move more tenderly If I had now my strength of natural hand And body to bear arms: but these shall come, And you change face and lower your look to see. Robert Stuart. I will abide my peril; do you the like, You shall do wisely; should I say farewell, It were to bid you fare not as they do Who are of your kind or of your fortune; yet I bid you, sir, fare better than I think. [Exit. Darnley. Ay, you think venomously. What hour to-day Should the queen come? Nelson. To-night your highness knows Her man Sebastian weds a maid of hers, And she makes feast for them in Holyrood With masque and music; having early supped, She will be here somewhile with certain lords To visit you, and so pass back ere night. Darnley. She shall not make so much, when I am revived, Of outland folk and fiddlers, who should have Too much of them by this. I would she had come To see me turn the lie back on his lips. I did not answer as I might, being whole, But yet not like a sick man, ha? like one Whose wit and heart lie sick too with his flesh? Nelson. Nay, with your natural spirit of speech you spoke, With the same heart and tongue you have in health. Darnley. I think I did; I would she had come betimes. Scene XX. —The Garden behind Kirk of Field. Bothwell, Ormiston, Hay. Bothwell. Did I not bid them spare no speed? the devil I think has maimed their feet in my despite, To keep a knave so piteous out of hell. By God, it will be moonrise ere they come. Ormiston. Tush, man! the night is close. Bothwell. Ay, close and safe As is the lock of a girl's maidenhood When the gold key turns in it. They halt like jades; God plague their laggard limbs with goads of fire! Must they fall spavined now? Hay. Here come they three, And with charged hands; be not so outward hot, But as their charge is ere we give it fire. Bothwell. Teach your own tongue to take your tune, not mine. Enter Hepburn with Servants. Have you some devil's cramp in your bones, to crawl At this worm's race? Set down your load and go. [Exeunt Servants. What lamed these knaves' feet or belated you, To hold us here thus till the moon were up? Hepburn. 'Tis not yet risen; and your own word it was Withheld us till the west should cast off red. Bothwell. Well, we have time. Ye three are hands enough To bear this down and strew it within the vault While I go help the queen here bide her hour Till you send Paris to me for a sign. Take heed there be no noise. Let but two stay To fire the train; you, cousin, for my love Shall be one hand thereto. Pass in, and see Ye go down sure and softly. From this gate Ye know the passage under; go, and speed. [Exeunt. Scene XXI. —Darnley's Chamber. The Queen, Darnley, Earls of Cassilis, Huntley, and Argyle. Queen. But I must chide you for one thing, my lord, That you would hold your servant Duram here Though it be for love you bear him; he is sick, And should not sleep nor watch with you to-night; You do not well to keep him from the town Against his health, who should take physic there And come back whole to serve you. Darnley. Let him go. I did but bid him leave me not alone; I will have one for service at my hand. Queen. Have you no more but just this young man gone Whom I bade go even where was best for him? Let your page lie at hand here. Darnley. Nay, I will. You sent off Alexander? Queen. He was sick; We should show care of them we take to grace More friendlike than by cherishing ourselves With their forced company; the grace is more To take thought for them whom we hold in trust Than still to exact their service, tax their faith, Whose faith and service we that lean thereon Should put to no more toil and pain than needs, Requiting love with labour. Darnley. You say well; But what should ail him? save that yesterday He found his bed-straw here by chance afire And flung it out at window; on which plea He would not lie to-night here, till I bade him Sleep with me as aforetime, being of all The man bound closest to my love and trust; Then first he spake of sickness, as you heard Who sat between us. Nay, but let him go; The boy shall serve to sleep here. Queen. Sickness makes All wills to serve it like necessity; Witness my will to keep my brother here Whom his wife's sickness at St. Andrew's now Parts from our feasts and counsels, caught up hence As if a wind had rapt him. Darnley. She is sick too— The Lady Murray? Queen. Nigh to death, he says; I know not: who knows how near death he walks Who treads as now most upright in the sun? Argyle. Why have we death and sickness in our mouths Who come forth of a feast not ended yet That in good time recalls us? Queen. Presently. I would you were in health to dance me down To-night but for the bride's sake; for the groom, He may live easier that you grace him not Nor gall with favour or with jealousy. Darnley. We twain shall see this night out otherwise. Queen. I am sure you shall see more of rest than I. Darnley. Except I watch for sickness' sake all night. Queen. That shall you not; I charge you on my love Sleep sound for my sake. Enter Bothwell. Are not you the bell That strikes the hour to sunder us, my lord? Bothwell. Madam, I strike not yet. Queen. The better; sit, And make no sound of parting till your hour, No timeless note of severance. My fair lord, Have you no fair word for your noble guests? Darnley. I pray you, sirs, of your own gentleness, Lay it not to my discourtesy for shame That I can but thus sickly entertain The grace ye do me; that I meet it so, Impute not to my will that is myself But to my weakness that is none of me Save as our enemy may be part of us, And so forgive it. Huntley. Sir, we are fain to see Even in your gracious words that speak you ill Some spirit of health already. Cassilis. I would pledge My name and word you shall not long lie sick Who bear yourself thus lordlike. [Noise below. Queen. Ah! my heart— It wrings me here in passing; pardon me. Bothwell. God's lightning burn them! will they mar me now? [Aside, and exit. Darnley. Heard you no noise? Argyle. Where? Queen. Some one stirred below; A chair thrown down or such-like. Darnley. Nay, I caught A rush and rattle as— Cassilis. Of pebble-stones? Darnley. Where is my lord gone forth? Queen. Why are you moved? Darnley. I am not moved; I am no fearful fool To shake and whiten as a winter tree With no more wind than this is. Queen. Do you think It is your counsellor come back in wrath To warn again and threaten? Darnley. Nay, for him I think he hath learnt a lesson of my rede To vex his soul and trouble me no more. Re-enter Bothwell. Queen. What deadly news now of what danger, sir? Bothwell. Some fellow bearing faggots for the fire Slipt at the threshold: I have admonished him What din his knaveship made even in our ears As if he had the devil there in his hands. Queen (aside). It was of them? Bothwell (aside). Ay, hell take hold on them, It was their din, God thank them for it with fire, Our careful helpers; but I have made them safe: The train is wellnigh laid now: what remains To strew I have charged them shed without more sound Than where the snow strikes. Darnley. Must you part indeed? Queen. They look for us ere long. Darnley. Now know I not What I would give to hold you here a night, Even half my life I think, and know not why. Queen. That were too much. I slepthere yesterday; Were you the better for me? Darnley. Ay, and no; I deemed I was the better till I slept, And then— Queen. Why, did my being here break your sleep? It shall not break to-night then. Enter Paris, and stands at the door. Bothwell (aside to Argyle). Time is come; Touch him, and give the sign. Darnley. The air turns sharp; There came a wind as chill as from the pit. Why do you fix your eyes so fast on me? Queen. Not out of mind to mar your sleep again. Darnley. I will not sleep alone. Queen. Ay, will you not? The town looks like a smoke whose flame is out, Deformed of night, defaced and featureless, Dull as the dead fume of a fallen fire. There starts out of the cloud a climbing star, And there is caught and slain. Darnley. Why gaze you so? Queen. I looked to see if there should rise again Out of its timeless grave the mounting light That so was overtaken. We must part; Keep with this kiss this ring again for me Till I shall ask it of you; and good night. Darnley. A good night it may be to folk that feast; I see not how it shall be good to me. Queen. It may be better. I must be some hour Again among the masquers: you that sleep Shall hear no noise and see no company. Enter Nelson. For this one night here comes your chamberlain: Good rest with you. 'Twas just this time last year David was slain. Darnley. Why tell you me of that? Queen. This very time as now. Good night, my lord. [Exeunt all but Darnley and Nelson. Darnley. What folk remain by me? Nelson. Sir, four of us: Myself and Seymour, Taylor and his boy. Darnley. Let Taylor sleep here in my room to-night, You three in the south gallery. Nelson. Well, my lord. Darnley. I am left here very lonely. She was kind; Most kind she was; but what should make her speak Of David's slaying? Nelson. A word that shot by chance; A shaft of thought that grazed her and flew by. Darnley. Why should she tell me of it? My heart runs low; As if my blood beat out of tune with life, I feel the veins shuddering shrink in, and all My body seems a burden to my soul. Come, I will think not that way. Re-enter Paris. Paris. Sir, the queen Having forgot for haste in parting hence Her outer cloak of fur, hath sent me for it, Lest this night's weather strike her blood acold. Darnley. Take it and go. (Exit Paris.) I do not like their eyes, These foreign folk's that serve her. Is it cold? I feel cold here. Nelson. A fair sharp night, my lord; And the air less cumbered than it was with cloud. Darnley. I find no night of all nights fair to me; I am sick here at my heart all the dark hours. Give me the book there. Ay, my book of psalms? What day is this? Nelson. The ninth of February. Darnley. How says it of God's foes, they were afraid Where no fear was? That am not I: my fear Dies without food. I am not as were these. I prithee tell me, of thine honest heart, Think'st thou I have no cause to feed my fear, Or keep the bitter life in it alive? Nelson. I know not, sir; but what you give it of food Is so much taken from your health of heart That goes to starve your spirit of likely life. Darnley. Why then I will not feed it with false thoughts. Call here my chamber-fellow. If the heart Enter Taylor. Be but the servant of chance cold and heat, And the brain bear not rule upon the blood, We are beasts who call us men. Thomas, good night. [Exit Nelson. What, shall we watch awhile? Taylor. So please your grace. Darnley. I have more mind to sleep than power to sleep; Some unrest in me fights against my rest. Come hither, Will. Of all thy fellows here I think thou lov'st me; fain am I to think; I would not live unloved of all men born; I hope I shall not. Dost thou feel to-night Thy living blood and spirit at ease in thee? Taylor. Surely, my lord. Darnley. I would thy lord did too. This is a bitter writing where he saith How in his prayer he mourns, and hath his heart Disquieted within him; and again, The fear of death is fallen upon him, see, And fearfulness and trembling, as is writ, Are come upon him, and an horrible dread Hath him o'erwhelmed: O that I had, saith he, Wings like a dove! then would I flee away, And be at rest; would get me then far off And bide within the wilderness, it saith, I would make haste to escape. Lo, here am I, That bide as in a wilderness indeed And have not wings to bear me forth of fear. Nor is it an open enemy, he saith, Hath done me this dishonour: (what hath put This deadly scripture in mine eye to-night?) For then I could have borne it; but it was Even thou, mine own familiar friend, with whom I took sweet counsel; in the house of God We walked as friends. Ay, in God's house it was That we joined hands, even she, my wife and I, Who took but now sweet counsel mouth to mouth And kissed as friends together. Wouldst thou think, She set this ring at parting on my hand And to my lips her lips? and then she spake Words of that last year's slaughter. O God, God, I know not if it be not of thy will My heart begins to pass into her heart, Mine eye to read within her eye, and find Therein a deadlier scripture. Must it be That I so late should waken, and so young Die? for I wake as out of sleep to death. Is there no hand or heart on earth to help? Mother! my mother! hast thou heart nor hand To save thy son, to take me hence away, Far off, and hide me? But I was thy son, That lay between thy breasts and drank of thee, And I thy son it is they seek to slay. My God, my God, how shall they murder me? Taylor. I pray you, comfort your own heart, my lord; Your passion drives your manhood out of you. Darnley. I know it doth; I am hare-hearted, for The hunters are upon me. There—and there— I hear them questing. I shall die, man—die, And never see the sun more; ay, this hour Will they come in and slay me. O great God, Sweet Jesus, will you have me die this death, Such death as never man before has died? See how they will not let me pray to you To take my soul out of their fangs and hell— Will you not make the sun rise for my sake That I may see you in the dawn and live And know the grace that God hath ere I die? Taylor. Sir, for God's love— Darnley. I say I hear their feet— Thou hast no ears—God hath no ears for me Nor eyes to look upon me—hands he hath, Their bloody hands to smite with, and her heart Is his toward me to slay me. Let them come; How do men die? but I so trapped alive— O, I shall die a dog's death and no man's. Mary, by Christ whose mother's was your name, Slay me not! God, turn off from me that heart— Out of her hands, God, God, deliver me! END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. JANE GORDON. Time: from February 10 to June 11, 1567. Scene I. —Bothwell's Apartment in Holyrood. Bothwell, Ormiston, Hepburn of Bolton, and other Gentlemen. Bothwell. Is my knave sent for to me from the queen? Hepburn. Ay, my good lord. Bothwell. I had happier thoughts of him Who served us but unhappily last night: This Paris had been faithful, and his tongue That might have struck a sting into my fame Had done me loyal service, and let fly No word to bring me in disgrace of men When I stood friendless; for which cause ye know I gave him place with the queen's chamberlains And promise of more furtherance; but this thing Has turned his six years' service into dust And made his faith as running water slip Between my hands that held it for a staff; For since I first brake with him of the deed He hath been for fear besotted like a beast. Ormiston. Faith, he was heavy enough of cheer last night, When you came forth, and the queen parted thence And hither to the bridal. Bothwell. By this hand, I came upon him glooming and withdrawn Up in a nook with face as of one hanged, And asked what ailed him to put on that gloom Or make such countenance there before the queen? And I would handle him in such sort, I said, As he was never in his life; by God, I had the mind to do it; and he, My lord, I care not what thing now ye do to me, And craved he might get thence to bed, as sick, But that I would not: then as ye twain saw When came the wind and thunder of the blast That blew the fool forth who took wing for death, Down my knave drops me flatlong, with his hair Aghast as hedgehogs' prickles, and Alas, My lord, what thing is this? and He had seen Great enterprises, marry, and many of them, But never one that scared him so as this; And such a thing would never have good end, And I should see it; by God I had a will To have set my dagger here into him, but yet I drew it not forth. Ormiston. I doubt you did not well; 'Tis of such stuff that time makes talebearers. Bothwell. I would not strike him for old service' sake, Were he more dangerous to me; but, God help, What hurt here can he do us? I tell you, sirs, I think my star that was not swift to rise But hung this long time strangled in dead cloud Is even by this a fire in heaven, and hath The heat and light in it of this dead man's That it hath drunk up as a dew-drop drawn Into the red mid heat of its own heart; And ye that walk by light of it shall stand With morning on the footless mountain-tops Crowned. Hepburn. There are crags yet slippery to be clomb, And scaurs to rend their knees and feet who rise. Bothwell. I have my hand here on the throat of time, And hold mine hour of fortune by the hair. Had I let slip this season I had fallen Naked and sheer to break myself on death, A cragsman crushed at the cliff's foot; but now Chance cannot trip me, if I look not down And let mine eye swim back among slain fears To reckon up dead dangers; but I look High up as is the light, higher than your eyes, Beyond all eagles' aeries, to the sun. Ormiston. You will be king? Bothwell. Was I not crowned last night? The hand that gave those dead stones wings to fly Gave wings too to my fortune, and the fire That sprang then in our faces, on my head Was as the gold forefigured on a king's. Enter Paris. What says the queen? why shak'st thou like a cur? Speak, beast, or beastlike shalt thou fare with me; Hast thou not seen her? Paris. Ay, my lord. Bothwell. Ay, dog? What said she to those gaping eyes of thine? Paris. My lord, I found her in her mourning bed New-hung with black; her looks were fresh and staid; Her fast being broken only with an egg, Ere she addressed herself again to sleep She spake but three words with me of yourself, How might you fare, and when she rose by noon You should come to her; no more. Bothwell. So let her sleep; There are that watch for her. For thine own part, I charge thee tell me one thing: in thy life Didst thou pledge ever promise or plight faith To that dead mask of kingship? Paris. Nay, my lord. Bothwell. Seest thou not now these gentlemen my friends? Not one of them but for troth's sake to me And loving service hath cast all things off To do as I shall and to fare as I; And if thou think'st, whom no faith bound nor love To serve that fool or come 'twixt hell and him To buckler him from burning—if thou think'st, That art my servant, thou hast sinned toward God In our offence, this lies not to thy charge But mine who caused thee do it, and all the lords' Who with me took this work in all their hands. And if now thou have will to go thy way, Thou shalt depart right soon with recompense; But for all pains that can be put to thee Thou must not take this on thy tongue again. Paris. My lord, I will not. Bothwell. Sirs, with me it rests To take some order for the burial soon When the queen's eye hath dwelt upon him dead, As shall be, lest men say for shame or fear She would not see him; then with all privy speed He shall by night be given here to the worms. His raiment and his horses will I take By the queen's gift; for being now highest in place I will present me kinglike to the time And come before men royal, who shall know I stand here where he stood in all their sight; So seeing at once if I be lord or no He that shall hate me risen shall need take heart To strike betimes, or strike not. At this hour Bold heart, swift hand, are wiser than wise brain. I must be seen of all men's fear or hate, And as I am seen must see them and smite down Or lie for ever naked underfoot Down in the dark for them to triumph on. That will I not; but who shall overthrow Must kill me kingly, sworded hand to hand, Not snared with gin or limetwig as a fool, Nor hurled by night up howling into heaven, But in the sun's eye weaponed. Some of you Go forth and find what noise is in the streets, What rumours and how tempered on men's tongues: When I pass out among them I will take Some fifty with me to my guard, and ride As might their king ride. Be it proclaimed abroad In mine own name and Maitland's and Argyle's Two thousand pounds shall pay that good man's pains Who shall produce the murderers of our king For just and sudden judgment. In few days, If Mar be not mine unfriend and his own, Who holds the keys of Stirling, we shall pass With some of counsel thither, and there bide Till the first reek of rumour have blown by, Then call in spring our parliament again. Hepburn. Your heart of hope is great; with God to friend, A man could speed no better than your hope. Bothwell. I tell thee, God is in that man's right hand Whose heart knows when to strike and when to stay. I swear I could not ask more hope of heaven Than of mine own heart which puts fire to me And of mine own eye which discerns my day. And seeing the hope wherein I go now forth Is of their giving, if I live or die, With God to friend or unfriend, quick or dead I shall not wake nor sleep with them that fear Whose lives are as leaves wavering in a wind, But as a man foiled or a man enthroned That was not fooled of fortune nor of fear. [Exeunt. Scene II. —Another Room in the same. The body of Darnley lying on a bier. Two men in attendance. First Attendant. There is no wound. Second Attendant. Nor hath the fire caught here; This gown about him is not singed; his face Is clenched together, but on hair nor cheek Has flame laid even a finger; each limb whole And nothing of him shattered but the life. How comes he dead? First Attendant. Tush, tush! he died by chance. Take thou no pain to know it. For mine own mind, I think it was his sickness which being full Broke as a plague-spot breaks and shattered him And with his fleshly house the house of stone Which held him dying; his malady it was That burst the walls in sunder and sent up A ruin of flaming roofs and floors afire. Second Attendant. Was not his chamber-fellow's corpse as his? First Attendant. Ay, woundless as they say and unconsumed; I know not surely. But the blast that made The good town ring and rock here through her streets Shook not all sleepers in the house to death; Three souls have crept forth of the wreck alive That slept without his chamber. Second Attendant. What say these? First Attendant. What should they say, with thanks for their own hap, But that this chance is dire and this man dead? There is no more yet for sage lips to say, That would not timeless be stopped up with earth. Enter the Queen and Bothwell. Queen. Leave us, and after take your charge again. First Attendant. We must forbear her till her moan be made. (Aside.) [Exeunt Attendants. Queen. Let me look on him. It is marred not much; This was a fair face of a boy's alive. Bothwell. It had been better had he died ere man. Queen. That hardly was he yesterday; a man! What heart, what brain of manhood had God sown In this poor fair fool's flesh to bear him fruit? What seed of spirit or counsel? what good hope That might have put forth flower in any sun? We have plucked none up who cut him off at root, But a tare only or a thorn. His cheek Is not much changed, though since I wedded him His eyes had shrunken and his lips grown wan With sickness and ill living. Yesterday, Man or no man, this was a living soul; What is this now? This tongue that mourned to me, These lips that mine were mixed with, these blind eyes That fastened on me following, these void hands That never plighted faith with man and kept, Poor hands that paddled in the sloughs of shame, Poor lips athirst for women's lips and wine, Poor tongue that lied, poor eyes that looked askant And had no heart to face men's wrath or love, As who could answer either,—what work now Doth that poor spirit which moved them? To what use Of evil or good should hell put this or heaven, Or with what fire of purgatory annealed Shall it be clean and strong, yet keep in it One grain for witness of what seed it was, One thread, one shred enwoven with it alive, To show what stuff time spun it of, and rent? I have more pity such things should be born Than of his death; yea, more than I had hate, Living, of him. Bothwell. Since hate nor pity now Or helps or hurts him, were we not as wise To take but counsel for the day's work here And put thought of him with him underground? Queen. I do but cast once more away on him The last thought he will ever have of mine. You should now love me well. Bothwell. Ay should I, sweet. Queen. I think you shall; it were more hard than death You should not love me. Bothwell. Nay, not possible. Queen. I think God never set in flesh of man Such heart as yours would be to love me not. Bothwell. Will you give order for his funeral? Queen. Ay. But if you loved not—I would know that now That I might die even this day, and my hands Shed no more blood nor strive more for your sake; For if I live whose life is of your love I shall take on them more of toil and blood, To stain and tire them labouring all their life. I would not die bloodguiltier than is need, With redder hands than these and wearier heart, And have no love to cleanse and comfort them. For this man, I forgive him. Bothwell. For which fault? Queen. That he touched ever and defiled my life With life of his and death. I am fain to know You do not love me for his sake the less Who so have soiled me with him. Bothwell. Shall I not Swear it with him for sponsor to mine oath? Queen. Kiss me before his face here for a sign. Bothwell. You have strange doubts and dreams. Queen. I will not have. When part we hence, and whither? Bothwell. I have word Your careful warden, the grave lord of Mar, Will hardly give my followers at your prayer Place to come in to Stirling at our back. Here now the streets begin to sound and swarm So that my guard is now for more than pride; Wherefore I hold it well we take with us Some friends of our own counsel, as Argyle, Huntley, my brother-in-law that shall be none, With Maitland and the archbishop, and set forth To the lord Seyton's, who shall give us house Till this loud world fall stiller than it is. Queen. Be it where you will, and how; do you but lead, Would I not follow naked through the world? For him of whose dead face mine eyes take leave As my free soul of shameful thought on him, Let him have private burial some fit night By David whom he slew. I mind me now 'Tis not a year since I fled forth with him Even through the graves where he shall lie alone, And passing through their dusty deadly ways For some few minutes of the rustling night I felt his hand quake; he will quake not now To sleep there all night long. See you to that. [Exeunt. Scene III. —Seyton Castle Lord Herries and Sir James Melville. Herries. So stands it, sir; she hath put into his hands Besides the lordship of the port of Leith The castle's government of Edinburgh, Of Inchkeith and Blackness, three master keys That keep the doors o'the kingdom; in Dunbar He sits now lord, and gathers men to hold By her next gift Dumbarton: while she sends A privy message for a priest to plead With the French king, that by his mother's mouth And his own hand hath warned her, if her lord Sleep unrevenged, she being so shamed henceforth Must hold them for her enemies, and put off All thought to flee for fear into their guard From peril of her subjects—even to him She sends for payment of her dower foregone Wherewith to levy hireling bands in France With but her babe for captain called, and be Fenced round at least with all of these she may, Of whose despatch none here must know before, Nor, if these fail her, of her frustrate aim; Then, ere her mourning month be here played out With hound and horn and soldierlike delights To recreate her natural heart and life, She must repass to Holyrood and meet The ambassador from England, Killegrew, Who comes to find folk sorrowing and in fear With counsel for our peril and our grief, And falls upon us feasting; and to him She plights her faith that by this parliament Shall Bothwell have his trial, and the cause Be sifted clear in the eyes of all good men; Wherewith content he parts, or discontent, I know not, but is gone; and she come back Takes heed no more than of a harp unstrung What plaint or plea, what charge or menace comes From her lord's father, but to his demand For convocation of the nobles made Returns her word their house shall meet in spring, And puts his charge by lightly as she may. Of all this nothing in my mind goes well. Melville. Nor aught in mine. Your fellows of her faith Who stand as yet in England on her side Will fall off from her, hearing what I doubt All ears will hear too soon: I have shown it her By letter sent me from a faithful Scot That long hath wrought among them on her part And freely thence wrote all his fear for me To lay before her, and his grief to hear Such bruit of her intent as could but slay The opinion of her judgment, who must lose By such design God's favour and her fame, And in each kingdom that should kiss her hand Each man's heart born her heritage, and miss The noble mark she shot at; I, adjured Of him that wrote to bring this in her eye, Gave her to read it, which she gave again, Silent; then came the secretary to me A short while thence, and took me by the hand Desiring me as by the queen's desire To let him see it, who had given him late to know I had shown her a strange letter, and devised By mine own counsel for Lord Bothwell's wreck; And having read, What thing was in my mind, He said, to do this, which being known to the earl, As shortly there was need to fear it should, Would cause him surely seek my life? and I, It was a sore thing for true men to see So good a princess run on utter wreck And no man be so far concerned in her As to forewarn of peril: he replied As one who had newly left her wroth, I had done More honestly than wisely; bade me fly Ere the earl came up from dining; and being flown I know he sought to slay me, who lay hid Till his main rage was slackened; and the queen, Who had made him swear to seek no scathe of mine When at their meeting next she showed it him, Chid him as who would cause her to be left Of all her servants; then he swore anew I should receive no harm; whereof again Being advertised I spake with her, and showed She had never done me so much wrong as this, To make the letter a device of mine Which came even whence I had given her word; and yet Had it not come, I had held me bound to speak Freely, with reverence and humility, My thought as did that letter, being of mind At one therewith; but she would give no ear; Nor is there force in counsel or man's wit To avert this ill she binds upon herself, Who breaks the bonds in twain that hold her friends, And fetters her own feet with gyves of steel, When she hath need of them to stand or flee Before the face of peril multiform That lightens on us flamelike: you, my lord, Whose love she hath proven, are not of me to learn The immediate feature of it. Herries. Alas, not I; I have taken too much note thereof, and stand Too near its fangs to live of them unscathed, Except I make haste hence. Melville. What haste, my lord? Herries. I have spoken with her of their purpose blown From lip to lip already on men's breath, To loose the bonds that bind her lover yet By witness of the lady of Buccleugh, Who shall proclaim herself his paramour And precontracted to him by promise-plight, To prove his wife no lawful wife, but bound, Will she or no, and love him not or love, To sue divorce from him; if all this fail, Then by remonstrance of their kindred blood Found some four cousinships away, this bond Shall melt or break that parts him from the queen. Melville. Why, ere his marriage with the Lady Jane She had her dispensation from the Pope For the blood mixed between them, of all bars Which might have maimed it with impediment. Herries. So had she, but they think to cover it As with a veil of invalidity Pretexted for pretence, or with dumb show Darkly disclaimed; this shall not cumber them; And they will buy compliance and goodwill Of Huntley to his sister's putting off By restoration of his forfeit lands. Melville. All tongues i'the land will as one mouth of fire Cry death and shame again. Herries. So said I. Melville. So said you to her? Herries. I said so; whereat she, As 'twere half smiling in a wondering shame, Half mourning to be guiltlessly misjudged, With fervent eyes' fall and with scornful lips Protests me, never had she thought of it. Wherefore I hold it ill to tarry here. Melville. Your wisdom shall do well to spare no speed, But get it gone from eyeshot of them both. Herries. I know it; yet would I plead again with her, For pity and honour of the imperilled state, That should be shaken with her fall to death And the crown shattered into shards of gold. For as a wolf anhungered and awaked That long hath slept and starved, with foodless dreams Assuaging its blunt fangs through bloodless hours, The common people, that in dumb dim rest, With heartless hopes assuaging its blind heart, Hath fed for ages on itself asleep, Shows now the keen teeth and the kindled eyes Of ravening heads innumerable, that gape And glare about the wide ways of the world, Seeking their meat of God; and if he fail, Then of the devil that burns in minds of men Rebellious, whom their heat of heart eats up Till the fire fasten on authority To lay red hands of ruin on all state And leave in ashes empire; as of late This Ket in England, and his like that swarm At heel of the new creeds in Lutheran lands To pluck the sun out of the heaven of rule, And leave men dark and kingless. Hath not Knox Struck with his fangs of speech on monarchy No less than on the Church that first was stung, Preaching for all men knowledge equally And prostitute and perilous freedom shared With all blear eyes, brute mouths, and unwashed hands, That lust for change and take all fires for light, Except the sun's wherein their fathers walked? And shall not these at any breach break in That flaws the sea-wall which forbade their sea To drown all banks that bound it? She will make Of all that lived in Scotland hers and ours A ruin and republic of strewn wrecks, Ranks rent, bonds broken, all things orderless, A commonwealth of dead men's bones and dung, Dust, mire, and blood, and one red rank of beasts That rage and revel in equality. Melville. 'Tis true, the commons are as waters chafed Since this wind blew amongst them: wave by wave It lifts their heads up, and the murmuring air Breathes hard and blackens with the blast of change. Herries. And were none touched with danger but herself, This yet were pity enough for tears of blood, So fair she is and less by place than kind Royal, so high and so assured of spirit, So full of all things all men love or fear, Heart's light and fire, a soul born winged, with eyes That mate the sun's eye and the lightning's; yea, It were past count of pity, past men's thought, That she should fall for love's light sake self-slain. Melville. There were one way to serve her that would be Most thankless, being thankworthiest; but none else. Herries. That were no way for feet that would not walk Red as her enemies' did, whose passage shook With its near sound her life and fame; such ways Let Morton take or Maitland's weaponed wit, Whose words are swords. Melville. It may be so they will. Herries. Death? Melville. Nay, who knows when death may come? Herries. Why, they Who strike the spur into his fleshless side, Who prick him forward with their craft for goad, Or put for sword their hatred in his hand. They have done deeds of deadlier policy Than make submissive show toward Bothwell here, Then snare and slay him or put the queen in ward: Would they do this they might be serviceable But perilous must be, putting hand to work That treads nigh treason though for loyalty. Melville. Whoso may know their mind, it is not I. Herries. She hath sent for Murray hither; in his eye We may take note which way their faction looks. If yet toward violence and red-handed craft, This mood of hers will strip her for their strokes Naked, and leave us handless that would fight On her just side against them. God mend all! Enter the Queen, Bothwell, Seyton, the Maries, and Attendants. Queen. The wind has moved my blood like wine; I am full Even to the heart's root of its spirit of life. Flew not my hawk the last flight well, that sent The tumbling hern down from her highest? I think You have none better. Is our brother come? Seyton. He is now alighting, madam. Queen. By this hand, I would when we must 'light from horse we might Take wing instead, and so what time we live Live ever at glad speed save when we sleep. It points and edges the dull steel of life To feel the blood and brain in us renew By help of that life lifting us, and speed That being not ours is mixed with us and serves. I would hold counsel and wage war and reign Not in walled chambers nor close pens of state, But or in saddle or at sea, my steed As a sea-wave beneath the wind and me, Or the sea serving as a bitted steed That springs like air and fire. Time comes, they say, When we love rest, house-keeping sloth, and calms; To me I think it will not come alive. Herries. Madam, I would change yet one word with you Ere I go hence or others take your ear. Queen. So shall you, sir; yet is my heart too light, And its live blood too merry from the chase, And all my life too full of the air of joy Whereon it mounts up falcon-like for prey And hovers at its wings' width ere it strike, To give wise words wise welcome; yet what grace I may to your grave counsels will I show And modesty of audience. Tell my brother I shortly will receive him. [Exeunt all but the Queen and Herries.] My good lord, It is for that old honour and true love I bear your high name and your flawless faith That yet mine ear makes way now for your words, In trust they will not wound it for its pains With any tuneless or intemperate breath. Herries. Had I no heart, or in the heart I have No love to serve you, madam, and no faith, I had parted hence without more toil of tongue Or strife of speech unpalatable and harsh In ears made wide for music; but in me Is heart enough to burn with fire of pain, If not to lighten with that fire their eyes For whose sake it consumes me, when I see Danger and death masked as true men and bold Attend about them with sheathed knives in hand And shut mouths as of serpents. Let me not Incense again your flame of spirit and scorn With faint and void reiterance of dead words That spent in vain their spirit before: I speak Not now so much to move you as would God I had the might to move, but of myself Rather to save my soul of faith alive And my deep heart of duty toward your grace By speech though fruitless and by love though lost That will not pass forth silent and give way To loud-tongued ruin that shall speak too high For ears to close against it. Queen of Scots, Lady that have the loftiest life in hand Even yet that ever was of queen on earth, Last hope of men that hope through you in God, Last comfort of his Church, light of his lamp That men have nigh blown out with blasts of night; O you to whose fair face and hand uplift The treble-kingdomed islands should turn back Out of the shadow of storm to follow them And in the shadow of faith instead lie down Beneath the wings that covered your crowned head, Even hers that brood above her fold and yours, The Church your mother's, that by no hand else Looks yet to gather three lands in and save— Who have the heart and the eye and the hour for this Which to none other God may give again So as you have them—you that should be writ In all the royal records of the world Saviour, the light and the right hand of God Shown in a woman, to bring back and build What was blown down or shed as dust on the air— You that have spirit and mind to apprehend And to that apprehension put swift hand, Nor slow of soul nor fearful—you, our queen, And England's heir, that should make higher on earth The name of Scot than any star in heaven, And on the cleft growth of two thorny stems Bid one rose flower of Catholic royalty Not to be plucked or trampled—O, will you, So great, so fair and fearless as you are, That were you no queen, or such other one As no such high cause calls on, you would seem Not less a thing made to heroic end, A creature crowned and armed by God to bear His witness to his work, and in man's eye Stand signal-wise lighting the beaconed sea,— Will you put all this as a garment off And change it like a vesture? By your life Which is the life of this land's majesty, And your high soul which is our spirit of hope, Slay not all these; help them that trust in you; Help God, lest we believe him for your sake Ill-minded toward us for our sin, to turn This empire to a populous wilderness, A riotous desert where things vile are crowned, And high made low and low things set on high, And rule trod under with foul feet and bare, And kingdom parcelled by hard hands and red; Pity this people; give not up your realm To its own madness that takes fire at yours And lights its ruin at your own ruin, to run By that blind light darkling to death and hell; Cast not your name down under foot of men For such ill cause as loveless love that is Light lord of foolish women, or such will As wherewith men self-slaughtered gird themselves. For shame and pity and peril shall be they Who shall attend and wed you to your will, And the ring broken of the kingdom's peace That is yet whole and circular as a crown Shall be the new ring on your wedded hand. Queen. Have I not said I never thought of it? Herries. I but beseech you keep from thought of it, Or from such show as puts it in men's minds. Queen. If this be all your counsel or your care, You crave but what you have; I have given no cause By favour shown to faith and loyal hearts For the evil-witted world to tax me of love. Twice have you had mine ear now to this tale, And thrice I pray you that you seek it not. Herries. I shall no more. God keep your grace in joy! Enter Bothwell and Murray. Queen. Good morrow, brother; and you my lord, good day, Since you go hence. Bothwell. Goes my lord from us yet? Herries. Even now I take my leave. Farewell, my lords, And God be with your counsels. [Exit. Bothwell. Nay, he shall. The queen was fain to have your voice, my lord, Ere she go back to the distempered town. Murray. That shall she have, sir. Queen. Brother, we hear word How the good town is troubled of lewd men With libels writ and hung about the streets That in our servants' name deface our own With fierce invention: wherefore I desired Your counsel with my lord here and good help For satisfaction of well-willing men. Murray. Even such will tell you it mislikes the town That Lennox, as they say, should be debarred From entrance save with six men and no more To hold his cause up on the trial day, And the main witness on his part refused As under charge of treason for his words Set forth in writing on the Tolbooth gates: This makes them doubt of justice to be done And brood or babble of devised delay, With tongues and minds diverse and dangerous. Queen. What, Shall one proclaimed our traitor pass unscathed To bear again false witness, for whose sake The ports are guarded, and the skipper marked For death who helps him from this kingdom forth To mock the judgment whence he stands attaint Of foregone treason, and must now stand free, And the law loose him and receive his word As a true man's and taintless? What are they Whom by such witness Lennox would impeach Besides my lord here who shall answer him? Murray. James Balfour, and your outland serving-folk, Sebastian, Joseph Rizzio, with two French, John of Bordeaux, and Francis, of your train. Queen. They shall have trial, and answer it. Murray. 'Twere best They did so soonest; time grows full of tongues; There was one late went through the streets by night With four or five accompanied for guard That would let none take knowledge of him, crying Of his own guilt most lamentably on God, Lord, open heaven and pour down of thy wrath Vengeance on me and them that have cut off The innocent blood; whom the chief magistrates Have seized and cast into the four thieves' pit; But still his cry hangs in the common ear. Queen. Some traitor hired or madman: but I sent To seek the comfort of your hand and help For weightier cause than of such tongues. Murray. What cause? Queen. That shall he show who bears most part therein; Yet are you parcel of it, and I myself For love of both and honour toward you. Speak. [To Bothwell. Bothwell. My lord, I doubt not but your heart conceived Never that thing whereto being done you feared To set your hand in sign; I therefore pray you To look upon the charge for which I stand In the land's eye accountable, as one That was consenting with the rest our friends To what for my poor profit was not done Nor only plotted for no end but mine; And for the part your honour has herein To underwrite the bond that writes me safe And set your name for seal upon my side. Queen. So much would I beseech you too; the bond By you subscribed here in my lord's defence Shall be the signet of your faith and love Set on my heart and his that honour you. Murray. I would my duty might in all things serve No less your honour than maintain mine own; But I will set no hand to any bond Shall bind me to defence or fellowship Of deeds whereof I know myself no part. I gave consent to no more than divorce Between two hands mismated, king's and queen's, Whereby the kingdom's heart was rent in twain, And reconcilement found not where to stand; But of no red and secret bond of blood Heard I the bruit before the deed took fire. Bothwell. Will you so swear? what, none? Murray. I have said; and you That reft your kinsman Balfour by device Out of my hand and thwarted judgment, see Your heart be set not now to climb too high A stair whereon the foot that slips grows red And stumbling once in blood falls whence nor wing Nor hand can lift it from the pit again. Queen. Vex not yourself lest he should fall or stand With whom you stand or fall not. Bothwell. My desire Was toward no help of riddling counsellors, But of such friends as speak with hand for tongue And acts for parables; your wit, my lord, Is nothing of the queen's need nor of mine. Murray. It may be, no; but to make trial of that, Ere I take ship for France, the ways being barred By force and strife through Flanders to the south And those fair towns that with her highness' leave Shall call me guest awhile in Italy, I am bound for London, where I fear and hope My tongue may serve her more than here your hands If it make fair her cause in English eyes. Bothwell. What hath her cause to do with their bleared sight, Or with her name their judgment? who need care What colour we that breathe with our own lips Wear in the mist made of their breath far off? Murray. The ambassador that bore her last word back Hath but made way for one at point to come Whose message, carrying weight as in wise ears It needs must carry, will take form and force From present witness of his eye that reads What mind is borne here and what work is done, What judgment or what counsel most bears weight; Which it imports us for this land's great sake That the English queen misknow not nor misread For fault or fraud of darkling evidence. Bothwell. And you it is must give those blind eyes sight, Shape to the shadows of that ignorance, form To their loose judgment of us? What have we, What hath our Scotland here or queen of Scots To do with English tongues? can we not strike Nor stand nor walk alone, but for our need Must use their hands and feet, their wits and eyes, To help us live or live not? By my life, Which is not held in pawn yet of their leave, I had rather be an English horse or ass Than on these terms a Scot, to square my will By their inscribed conditions. Murray. At your will Lies your own way of life; not yet this land's, Nor theirs that living should be lords of it. Madam, to God's care I commend your grace Who take with careful heart my leave of you, Lest you too much should lack the care of men. Queen. Be not too careful for my sake; your leave Was given ere you could take it. Sir, farewell. Murray. Farewell, as you shall will it. [Exit. Bothwell. God be with you! Your wisdom shall not be so hot of foot But it may be outspeeded. If it lay Plots with the stranger, our prevention here Must pluck the fangs out of its craft; and first With his own hand shall Huntley draw the bond Whereto will we set ours in pledge ere long To make them fast by contract, I being free To plight mine own, as by consent unbound From hers that was my wife pretended; you, Being by this troublous time bent and inclined To seek some stay in wedlock and put off The weak estate of widowhood, yet loth For worthy reasons of grave strength to choose Again a stranger subject, have made choice Of me desertless for my fair deserts, And purpose even on heel of my divorce For their good cause to wed me; this subscribed Shall in my keeping be laid up, and straight Thence must we back to that loud town of yours And take our danger by the throat; proclaim At once my trial; if it be possible, Before word come from England; let the post That brings you counsel of Elizabeth's Find the cause judged and the cry fallen again And no link hanging of the gyves of law Round our free feet and steadfast. Queen. Ah, not mine, That are fast bound and yet can stand not fast Except my love's strength hold them up, and strike These iron toils in sunder. If the bond Could bind and loose indeed, knit and unknit Hands that must part from hands that are to meet, With force of more than writing, all my heart Should bleed glad drops to sign and seal it. Sir, Here was again our enemy in mine ears Forewarning me of marriage; the same tongue That was before a serpent at your heel Shot out anew to sting it; but you know The craft of this state horseleech, that by fraud Takes pleasure to bear all the world in hand That no one can be sure of him, and we May least of all be by such lips allured To trust and find them dangerous. Bothwell. Nay, by God, I mind me how he left his neighbour friends In his faith's name to hang for hostages Whose necks paid forfeit of his broken bond, And made his oath a halter for the Lairds Of Lochinvar and Garlies. By my life That this keen tongue would strike at, in my mind It were the best work worth a good man's hand To quit them on Lord Herries. Queen. No, let be; You will unpeople me this land of friends; Mine he must live, or lose his name, and yours For my name's sake he shall be. Bothwell. So might I Find at his hands such friendship as they twain Whose throats for him were writhen; and such a friend Is he that stands behind our deed, and says He never heard of manslaying, fie, not he, Our darkling brother with close lips and clean, The blood was no part of his bond, he says, That his eyes winked on while his hand was dry; He will not bear us witness nor take part With me that have done more than blink at blood. He will to London, but to speak for you, That will he, being a kindly man of kind, Whole-blooded in his love and faith to you, God wot, no bastard in his brotherhood. I would give God a year out of my life That I have kinglike hope to live with you For one sweet breath of time to strike at him And let my sword's lip drink his body dry And with one deep kiss drain his flesh of blood. Who smells not by the savour of his faith On what close nest of foul and fledgling hopes His trust sits brooding to build up himself By overthrowing of that crowned head which keeps His misbegotten forehead bare of gold— And with my hand shall keep it? Queen. Ay, though all That breathe on earth mine enemies at his beck Rose by the light of his ambiguous eyes With his sheathed hand to strike, and leave ungirt This forfeit head with empire: but I know A stronger hand bared for my help and stay, This that I touch, this that I love; the star That points my feet on pilgrimage, the staff That stays my steps back to that troublous town Whereof they are weary, yet would halt not now, But tread more fleet than fire their fiery way To that fair end where they were fain to be. We will set forth to-morrow. Bothwell. Ere we go, I will take order that men's tongues be clipt Who show too broad their conscience of remorse; There was a knave of Balfour's in our trust That hath by this, being found unsure of mouth, Resigned it to the counsel-keeping worm. If more there be that live not stingless yet, The same dumb mouth that has nor lips nor tongue Must open for them privily; the grave Hath gorge enough for all such secret food, And will not babble of the hands that feed. For them that being in blood of our own kind Will stand elsewhere against me than in court, I will make present proffer of myself To answer them in arms. Queen. You shall not fight. Bothwell. Not if no need be. Queen. There shall be no need. Not in this cause, you shall not need to fight. We will set on the trial presently, And after we may sleep with no blood more. Scene IV. —The Upper Chamber in Holyrood. The Queen and Mary Beaton. Queen. Is it not hard on ten? Mary Beaton. At point to strike. Queen. This forenoon will outlast the night for length. How looks the morning? Mary Beaton. Like the time of year; The heaven is red and full of wind; the clouds Are rent and routed of the striving sun Like a lost army. Queen. Is there no noise abroad? Mary Beaton. The throngs grow thick in rumour; faces scowl, Eyes burn, brows bend, and all the cry o'the crowd Waits to break forth but till a fire-flaught fall To make the dumb brands speak and shoot out flame When he shall pass for whom it waits to burn. Yet have I seen as great a throng from hence As frets there now. Queen. I would he had thought to-day To ride with doubled guard. What brawl is there? Mary Beaton. The messenger from Berwick, as I think, That would have entrance to you, and is thrust back By the lord Bothwell's kin that keep the gates. Queen. What, here so soon? I will not see him till night. I am asleep; if there be brawls i'the court, Call out the troopers, bid my French guard forth To quell all rioters. Mary Beaton. They are of your own part That make the brawl, my lord's men and your guard That press about the gateway. Queen. The cry sinks; Is he not come, that so their noise is fallen? Mary Beaton. And Maitland with him; he signs them silent, takes From the English messenger a letter sealed, And leaves all still. Queen. I prayed him see me first Before he rode to trial. All will be well, If he have stayed their storm, and keep his heart High as his fortune. Enter Bothwell. Is that brawl at end? Bothwell. Here is a letter by a hot-foot post Brought from Sir William Drury, that his queen Through him commends her counsel in to you And bids you, or my thought belies it, show All favour and furtherance to your enemy's plea, Lennox, whose cause she finds most fair, and would not For your own sake see slighted or put by Lest your fame bleed; look if she say not so; Else I know nothing of her maiden mind, Who sometime lived her prisoner. Queen. Let that rest; But tell me what the spring was of this noise That shook our hearing; would he speak perforce, This English post, though bidden back, with me? Bothwell. But that our fellows thrust him from the gate; My captain of the castle, a stalwart guard, The Laird of Skirling, that I put in charge, Called to the guide aloud, he should be hanged For bringing English villains through to us here, And hands were there to reive the rope to him; Then drew your guard together and our troops, Whose musters line the straitened streets with steel That holds embanked their muttering multitudes Till I ride through; and those within the gates Hurtled together with blind cries and thrusts, But at my sight fell silent as a sea Settling, that growls yet with the sunken wind, And holds its peace with unslaked wrath; then I Took from the pressed and labouring messenger His letter for your hand, who were not risen And should ere night receive him; so I said, And thus it shall suffice you do, so be it We bear the bell to-day in parliament, Where I should be by this at bar, to stand And make mine answer. Queen. I am not sick of fear, Yet my heart loathes its burden of this hour And beats and drops like a bird wounded. Nay, I do not hold you; go; 'tis but my hand Fastens on yours; my heart would have you gone, And here again to assure me of good speed. Whom have we of the judges on our side, Tell me once more, whom doubtful-coloured, whom Our enemies certain? let me know it again, That I may read the bede-roll of their names Here over in my heart while you are gone To make it sure and strong, come evil or good, That neither find me heartless. Bothwell. Of our part The lord of Arbroath for the Hamiltons Is as his father's person, Chatelherault, And Cassilis a mainstay safe as steel; Caithness and Herries are such friends of yours As love me less for your sake, yet I think Must strike to-day beside us; one man most I would we might have razed out of the roll, Which is the assessor, Lindsay; who shall be As poison to us; and evil is our chance That Morton being of kin to your dead man Should not sit here to help, as but for this I would perforce have bound him to our side; But let this be; we shall bear bravely through For all their factions and fierce policies As knives ensheathed against us, or being foiled Find surer issue than they wot of. So, With such good hope as grows of a good heart, Give me God-speed. Queen. God speed you as I pray You may speed ever; all my prayer is spent, I can no more of wishing; what I would, That must you will, having my heart in you, That beats but with your blood, thrills with your sense, Thinks with your thought, desires with your desire, And lives upon your living. Where you go You bear me with you; where your face is set Mine eye takes outlook, and where falls your foot I tread beside you silent. O, this day Shall be to us as the crown o'the wave that turns And bears inshore the lading of our lives With all the might of its great heart that breaks And brings us into harbour; we shall stand High on the beach where it was spent, and praise The faithful hour that served us; yea, even this Shall be a dear one to us, held fast at heart When all the pain and doubt of it is dead, And lovingly remembered; you shall look From your high place beside your humble love With kingly eye on this dead day, and think How she that set her crown about your head And put her own beneath your foot, as now Bade you fare forth, and kissed you. Bothwell. I am returned, Ere I pass forth, already in my heart, With my cause crowned; I cannot doubt of speed Who have your face before mine eyes as fire And keep your words' heat in mine ear to burn If I should shrink, and sting my spirit alive For love's and shame's sake. When we meet at night, A king's kiss will I set upon these lips That seal me royal ere I part. Farewell. [Exit. Queen. I would mine eye were in my heart to go With that beside him; but the heart it is Sits now in the eye and follows where it may, But a street's length; then part they, and the sight Turns back, but not the thought; such wings it hath As the sight hath not, and is subtler nerved Than the swift spirit of the eye. O my life's light, This is not I that looks forth after you To feed her eyesight, but who leaves you not, Who rides beside you, breathes out of your lips, Looks through your eyes and triumphs in your heart, That unseen and inseparate thing is I. Look, he is up; how royally he rides, As no king else on earth! and waves to me As who should say, Be glad; and glad I am, Who have the lordliest lover in the world And the most heart to love him. Ay, that steed Should be the higher of heart that feels him stride And moves the merrier-mettled; by none such Was it before bestridden. Mary Beaton. Was not this Lord Darnley's horse? Queen. Ay, when Lord Darnley was. Mary Beaton. The horse he loved of all the rest and fed Ere he bestrode it ever? Queen. Like enough; What ails it yet to have eaten of his hand? It bears not now the worse a better man. Mary Beaton. Nay, so it seems: it bounds not as in wrath, For aught I see, beneath him, but heaves up A sidelong head toward his new hand, and turns The light back on him of a joyful eye. So is it with only beasts that are beloved; They have not hearts like ours. Queen. What need they have? I would have nothing love him as I love, And had it heart it would; yet I do think All beasts and men are mad that love him not As I should surely were I beast or man. He can no longer see my handkerchief; Let us go in: I will not sit and wait With the street's hustling faces in my sight. [Exeunt. Scene V. —The High Court of Justice in the Tolbooth. Bothwell, with Ormiston and others attending, at the bar; Argyle presiding as Lord Justice; Lindsay as assessor; Caithness, Cassilis, Rothes, Ar broath, Maxwell, Herries, and others, as jury; Robert Cunningham as spokesman for Lennox. Ormiston (aside to Bothwell). Fie, look not down so at your feet, my lord; What devil is this that irks you? in your face A fool might read you what you are; why, so Might a man look that were now going to death. Hold up your face for God's sake and look blithe; Alas and aye woe worth them that devised The thing that shall make all us mourn, I trow, For you that now look sadly. Bothwell. Hold your peace; I would not yet it were to do; I have An outgate any way whereby to pass, As ye shall know, and soon. Trouble me not. Argyle. My lords, ye have heard how to the indictment read The accused who stands at his own instance here Returns his plea of guiltless; and thereon The accuser next invoked to approve his charge, Nor answering nor appearing, leaves no cause For us to judge; but here in his default Is risen his servant to sustain his part And unawares among us unrequired Take up this charge here fallen, or stretch at least, Some form across or pretext wide enough To cover with excuse this lack of charge, Which else might seem with emptiness of cause To mock your judgments; wherefore, if ye will, He stands to plead before us. Caithness. We are content. Robert Cunningham. My lords, I am here but in my master's name, The earl of Lennox, to declare what cause This day constrains his absence; which in brief Is first the brief time given for so great work, Next that he stands now naked of his friends And fellowship of servants to maintain His honour with the surety of his life; And having help of no friend but himself, He hath laid on me commandment to desire A day sufficient for that weight of cause Which he shall have to keep it; and if hence Your lordships at this present shall proceed, Here I protest that if the assize to-day, By their twelve persons that upon this charge Shall enter now on panel, speak him clear Who stands accused for murder of the king, It shall be wilful error in men's eyes And not abuse of ignorance, by this cause That all men know him for murderer; and hereto Upon this protestation I require Of your high court a document to stand And set my lord's right here on register And those men's wrong who put it by to-day. Argyle. This is some reason if the ground be good Whereon his protest is built up, to excuse Default of witness by defect of time; But here that ground is shaken, that we find, By letters of his own writ to the queen, My lord of Lennox earnest to bring on With forward expedition as of fire This cause for trial, and by all pleas intent To enforce this court make haste, and being convoked Despatch with breathless justice and short stay The work wherein he seems to accuse us now For too much heat to move too fast, and mar The perfect end of trial with force of speed, Preventing him of witness. Wherefore then Was his own will so keen, his plaint so loud, So strong his protestation, to procure The speed too late reproached, too soon required? Here are we met for judgment, whom himself Bade the queen summon, with insistent heat And sharp solicitation urged of wrong, Nay, with the stroke of an imperative tongue, As though to impel some loth or laggard heart, And found instead a free and forward will In her to meet his own; here sits the court, There stands the man of him or his impeached To give them loyal answer; where sits he? Where speaks his proof? where stand his witnesses? What sentence of what judges shall be given Where none stands forth to accuse? Here are but words, Surmises, light and loud and loose, that blow In the air of nameless lips and babblers' breath From ear to ear about the wide-mouthed world; These are not for our judgment. Caithness. We sit here To find if there be proof or likelihood More than of common tongues that mark a man Guilty, and know not why this man or that, But some name they must have to feed upon; And in my mind where witness there is none Nor prosecution of a personal cause, Even should we err to find the accused man free, It were no wilful error, nor this court In any just man's sight accountable As for unrighteous judgment, being cut off From evidence that it was met to hear; Which we reject not, but require indeed, Yet can by no solicitious mean procure. Moreover, sirs, one flaw there is to note More evident than these proofs invisible Even in the letter of the charge, which bears, Ye see, the ninth day's date of February, When all we know that on the tenth it was This violence, by what hand soe'er, was done: So that I see not, for my simple part, How any man, for that which no man did, Should stand condemned; for at this date assigned Was no such deed as this done in the world. Maxwell. Why, let the charge be drawn again, and straight; The court is mocked in this. Caithness. How mocked, my lord? It is necessity of law, to keep Pure hands by perfect heed of flawless words; And that you stood the dead man's friend alive Gives you not right nor reason to rise up And tax the reason or the right of law. Maxwell. Right! where is right in all this circumstance, Or aught but wrong and broken judgment? where Justice or shame or loyalty, to try The truth whereon red fraud and violence tread And smother up the tongueless cry of blood? Are we not here to judge of murder done, And either from an innocent brow take off The spot of its suspicion, or convince The branded forehead of bloodguiltiness? Is there no counsel on the part accused Nor answer of defensive argument But of close-lipped evasion? and the court In this forsooth is mocked not! We shall stand The shameful signs of laughter to the world And loathing to men loyal, if this pass With no more trial but mockery, and the land Sit silent and attaint of innocent blood Before the face of all men that expect For our own sake what justice we shall show Or be defamed for ever. Arbroath. Sirs, meseems Where no charge is that no response can be, Where none impeaches, none can stand accused: And of what mouth what challenge is put forth, And on what witness what impeachment hangs, To implead of guilt the man we sit to try? Herein I say it is the court is mocked, Even all of us, and all the baffled land, And most this noble man that unaccused Stands at our bar and finds not to confront One witness, nor one enemy to beat back, But only as 'twere a wind that sounds, a breath That shifts and falters in the face of proof, A blast that envy blows and fear breaks off, Disabled of its nature, by itself Frustrate and maimed of its own evil will. Lindsay. Who talks of envious or of fearful heart? We hear the general judgment of the land Cry out for trial, and from foreign tongues Reproach cast on us that we cast off heed; What should we do for shame if in this cause, For doubt of one man's friends or of what power Might stand behind to buckler him at need, We durst not move, nor, though the world looked on, Show but a face of justice? Cassilis. Must we set Our judgments by the common tongue that strikes And knows not what the hour is? or become Thralls to the praise and bondmen to the blame Of men by no tie blood-bound to our love, To make our lives look in their foreign sight Fair, lest they speak us evil? By my head, No Scot I hold him, but a strange man's knave, Whose spirit is shrunk or swollen by their breaths. Argyle. Well, let the votes be given, and each man's doom Affirm if in his true and equal mind The charge be proven upon my lord or no. How go the voices? Lindsay. By one half their dooms The lords here of the jury speak him free With clear acquittal of bloodguiltiness; One half is voiceless. Argyle. He then is proclaimed Of this high court not guilty, and the charge On trial stands not good against him. Sir, The court upon this plea declares for you You are found free of blood. Bothwell. My noble lords, Being proved thus in your judgments clear of crime, Here on this door will I to-day set up My personal challenge in mine honour's right To meet in arms, before what judge he will, What gentleman soever undefamed Should take upon him to confront my cause. For their lewd mouths who threat and wear no sword, Your judgment given to acquit me shall abash The malice it puts power into mine arm With might of right to baffle. Sirs, good day. [Exit with Ormiston and his followers. Argyle. Break up the court; the cause is judged. Maxwell (to Lindsay). Is judged? I know not of such seed what stem will spring, But that fruit sour as gall and red as blood For men's false mouths must of this judgment grow I would I saw less surely than I see. Scene VI. —The High Street. Burgesses and People. First Citizen. What more of shame is laid up for us? when Will heaven put forth a hand to touch with fire These naked sins and shrivel? Have you heard What last lies bare for judgment? Second Citizen. Why, the last Is not this half-hour's shame; each stroke each day Strikes out a fresh one, that five minutes old Dies of the next forgotten. Yesterday Some talk was of the challenge yet, which now No man casts thought on, though by two good swords Was battle proffered: by the stout laird first Of Tullibardine, in that brother's name Whom they for fear have taxed of treason, so To eschew his proof and peril; he defies The challenger to combat, and requires England and France for judges of the field In person of their sovereigns; this refused, On such new plea as craven craft may find, With his queen's leave the ambassador himself Of England gladly with his own heart's will Would take the personal cause upon him. First Citizen. What Is it for fault of Scots to match and mate The pride in Bothwell swoln with innocent blood None but Sir William Drury may be held Worth his sword's wrath that walks by night? Third Citizen. Perchance As for his queen he stands here deputy, And for our own her champion opposite Afield with swords' play or abed with lips', They hold the match more equal. Fourth Citizen. Nay, this news Is grey of beard already; hear you not How by this priestly parliament of ours, That to beguile us and for no good will Hath in the queen's name passed its act to affirm God's present gospel 'stablished in this realm, The murderer lives now twice absolved of blood And has by voice of prelates and of earls The assize allowed for good that purged him first, And shall be loosened of his marriage bond That twelve months since was tied? his brother-in-law Shall have again his forfeit lands, and see His sister from her married bed thrust out, And stir no finger; then without more stay Who sees not where the adulterer's foot shall climb And by what head his own be pillowed? nay, These papers hung against our walls by night Are tongues that prophesy but truth; ye saw That likeness of a hare enringed with swords And of a mermaid crowned with burning eyes Who drove the hounds off with a two-thonged scourge That coursed him trembling; and her hand indeed Is found not slow to smite; a law now lives Denouncing on his head no less than death Who shall set up, or seeing shall pluck not down, Such placards writ: the first soe'er who finds And leaves the writing that defames her friend To pass among the people, at her will Shall lie in bonds; but if this brand herself, Then must the man that spared it or that set Die; so the fire-eyed queen of shipwreck sings Death in their ears who sail this dangerous sea Whereon the ship reels of our staggering state, And with the flame shot from her eyes puts out The light of theirs that were as lightnings turned On her hare-hearted lover. Third Citizen. Yet they lack The power with boast or menace to seal up The lips of poor men; but three days ago As she rode through the Grassmarket I heard How from their stalls the women cried on her, God save your grace! but with this added word That smote the smile upon her lips to death, If ye be spotless of the dead king's blood. Second Citizen. Such words and souls mount nigher God's ear and eye Than theirs who lent this man their hands to slay And tongues to purge him of their general sin, He of St. Andrew's and his under priest, Bishop of Ross, Leslies and Hamiltons Whose lips are bloody, and that double soul Argyle, that steers their faction; and this crew Masked here as mouthpiece of the loathing land Must hide the people's heart and true men's truth With craft of prattling prelates; yet such mouths As are unlocked and locked again with gold But gape till God shall pluck their tongues out. Fifth Citizen. Yea, Ye hear but this, and have to burn your ears No hotter news of these men, or what bond Bears written broad and brave such names as these Of earls and bishops? this is strange yet, sirs, That fires my cheek to tell you? Second Citizen. Why, men said There was a knot that met of these to sup Shut in with Bothwell's hackbutters for guard That drew round Ainslie's Tavern where they sat Like a strait hoop of steel to bind them safe And hold them fast from starting; and some bond Of these his guests at Bothwell's prayer subscribed There was that bound them to him, against all foes That might impeach him of the crime discharged By the open court's acquittal, from this day To take his part upon them and stand fast As to their own cause, being made subject all To slander and suspicion that but grows Of honour and high credit held with kings: So much we heard, and found not strange. Fifth Citizen. Nay, this Was but the grace that served their banquet in Of meats as strong as poison; there ensued A pledge more mortal of a bond more base; Considering this time present, how the queen Stood husbandless, and how the general weal Might let her not long live so, should her mind By thought of his true services be moved To take the earl Bothwell to her loving lord, They and each man there met of them should plight His honour, truth, and heart's fidelity To advance this marriage with all furtherance given Of counsel, satisfaction, and good help As soon as law might give it leave to be, And as their common enemy should esteem What man soever of evil will to them Might seek its hindrance; and to this were set More than those names ye spake of; be it for fear, For craft or vantage, none of these fell off Save Eglinton that slipped for shame away, And Morton with the secretary, that gave Their voice yet for this marriage, but would seal No general bond of service on his side: Save these, no priest or peer of them but lives His servant pledged; their hands, tongues, counsels, hearts, His or not theirs, and all they mansworn men. Third Citizen. I have assurance of a true man's faith That word was writ of this confederacy To the English council from the laird of Grange, Desiring knowledge with what ear their queen Shall take these tidings; and albeit of late In all our trouble being found slow to help She lost the love here borne her, if her grace For this late murder will pursue revenge, She shall win all the hearts of all the best Again, he says, in Scotland; who should be, With her good help and favour, swift to take This vengeance on them, and redeem from fear Their prince's life now trembling in the reach Of hands that slew his father; for our queen Hath sworn she cares not for her lover's sake To lose France, England, and her natural land, And would go with him to the wild world's end Stript to her smock ere leave him. Second Citizen. Has he writ So much to the English court of her? being ours, He should let shame keep silence of her shame. First Citizen. What shame or silence can shut up for shame That which at noon walks clamorous of itself And boastful to be naked? They will wed, Though thunder sound forth sin, and while God speaks Will kiss in sight of lightning. Fourth Citizen. Was there not Some noise of strife arisen for fault of pay Among their crew of Bothwell's villains here That hold by force of hand the palace gates? Second Citizen. Such rumour was, for certain; and himself Strode in among the middle mutiny Like a thieves' captain, and being braved of them Caught by the throat one that was lord o'the brawl And would have slain but for the throng that cried And drove upon him shouting, till for fear He was even fain to stop with promises Their mouths who clamoured; which to see fulfilled Needs must he sit no lower than doth a king. Third Citizen. So then the gates are open, and the queen By leave of these her guards and him their chief May part in peace for Stirling now to see Her son in ward there of the castellan? Where we, God knows, may give him thanks that one So wise as the earl of Mar and stout of heart Hath our born king in covert, who might sleep On that sweet breast that bore him not so safe As in a hand so honest. First Citizen. Ay, God help, There is no surety in such housekeeping As thunder comes forth of the sky by night To fall upon and burn it, yet no storm Save of men's making seen, nor fire in heaven Save what rose up from under. Verily, Our good lord Bothwell spake but truth who said To good James Melville how so strange a thing On earth was never known of: pity 'tis He could not come to look upon the corpse Though Bothwell bade him, seeing it was removed; It was his hapless chance to find it gone And in safe keeping of some secret hand That waited on it living; such things are: The worse hap his. They say it had no wound; So if by some mischance, as God forbid, The prince were reft unluckily of life, I think he should have none for eye to see That might read evil. Third Citizen. Who shall ride with her? Second Citizen. Why, no great train, lest being within the walls She take the child into her hand and give For better care to Bothwell's, with the keys That keep this castle too; but yet I think His hand nor hers shall put God's judgment back That waits to take them triumphing, and turn To tears their laughter and our grief to joy. Scene VII. —Stirling Castle. The Queen and Huntley. Queen. Will you go back from us? Huntley. I like it not; I do not see how this may be made good. Queen. There is no flaw but in your fainter heart; The way is fair and even; I cannot think What seed is in men's hearts that brings forth fear Out of all season. Why are you so sad? The thing is no more dangerous than it was When our first plot was laid; nay, so much less By how much these are ours whose names and bonds Speak on our side inscribed. Huntley. Madam, not so; The earl of Sutherland, whose forfeiture Your grace but now remitted with mine own, When we shall meet my brother's men in arms, Will die before he yield you to their hands. Queen. My lord, you have no brother of him now That was your sister's husband. I will write To bid him bring up men enough to outmatch All that ride with us homeward, and so far That none the hardiest shall but think on fight. Three hundred hath your earl? then in his rank There shall be more than of our company, That I to spare men's blood may yield myself. Huntley. It is too gross and foolishly devised; When I spake last with him, he laid on you The charge to say where we should meet and when, And what should by contrivance plead for me, To save my name though you be yielded up Who ride with me for escort; all this charge He lays on you, and bids me write again What you shall say by letter; of himself He moves not yet; and I beseech you think, Before you move him, in what enterprise You put to pledge your honour, that can never With honour wed him who being wedded man By force and violent hand hath borne you off; Nor will my folk endure it, I wot well, But it must come to trial by hap of fight With doubt and accident of answering arms; Where if we fail on our part, then on his Shall be the blame and bloody note of war Made on your personal guard; but if we win That ride with you as followers, then is he The most forlorn of men revolted; else, I shall be called of all that sin on earth The most unthankful traitor, who being now But newly of your grace remade your man Shall yield you up by treason without blows Into a rebel's handling; and the lords, I doubt, when they shall see you in his hold, Will think not much to unswear their oaths, deny Their words and hands as given through force or fear, And signed not of their hearts; I pray, think of it, And take some other counsel to your mind. Queen. My lord, if you bear back my word to him, It shall be this: that seeing I am come so far, If of his own will he withdraw him not, For no persuasion nor for death itself Will I be brought to break my faith with him. For this you say of them that follow you And of your fear to bear a thankless name For my supposed betraying, you should by now With him have taken counsel of the chance, And not have thrown it here across my way Who have no choice to pass not over it, Seeing I may turn not back for life or death, For fear or shame or love of any man. As for the place, he doth not well to cast On me too even the election; let him choose, And send me word, with pardon that herein I tax my lord of too much negligence. For those your followers whom you most misdoubt, You shall be wise to weed our train of them If any wise mean be to draw them forth. This is my counsel, of a simple wit And womanish, but not so vile at heart As to go back for danger from its faith. I pray you so report of me, and say When he shall ask you of my mind again, No more but this word only; and farewell. [Exit Huntley. This faint-heart honesty with half a hand Is falser found at need than falsehood's self, And ever was of me more hated. O, That I might take these hours as in my hand And men that yet divide us, with one grasp To gripe them dead and pluck his fang from time That waits to fasten on us unawares And make love mortal with the kiss that kills! A day and night are as a long life's length That part the hungering from the perfect hour, The void from the fulfilling.—Nay, come in. Enter Mary Beaton and Paris. Mary Beaton. Here waits my lord of Bothwell's messenger To bear your word back of Lord Huntley's mind. Queen. Ay, that I found it trustless. Tell my lord He makes me mad to put his faith in him And to mistrust that which is wholly his, Even her true heart to whom he should have sent Word every day what she should do for him, And hath done nothing of it. I did say He should take heed of that false brother-in-law, Of whom his negligence and heedless faith Have put us in the danger; on my part There has lacked nothing toward the work in hand, And had he not more changed his mind than I Since I went from him, he should need not now By stranger's lips inquire of my resolve. Say how you see me, and till he send me word That I will here lie sick, as God he knows What health I have at heart; would I were dead, For all I see goes ill; but tell your lord This was not in his promise that I find, Nor no such matter; but he lets me see What power has absence on him, to whose bow His hand has yet another string than mine. And look you warn him of this brother-in-law That he hath babbled of our enterprise Wherein he puts but forth a heartless hand, And in what great men's ears he well may guess Who knows which most are dangerous; yet methinks If still we have need to flatter them, so much Might naturally be pleaded on his part, That his good service and long amity Might well deserve his pardon and their love If past a subject's duty he put forth, Not to constrain me but assure himself Of such place nigh me that no foreign tongue May by strange counsel hinder my consent To that whereto he trusts his service shall Make him one day to attain; with such excuse Shall he persuade them that he stands compelled To make pursuit against his enemies: And he may find fair words at will to say To Maitland most of all, through whose keen tongue We hold the rest by the ear; but if at last The deed of our device mislike him now, Let him send word and leave not on my head The blame of all; and if it like him yet, Say I beseech him for the honour of God To come with no less force accompanied Than of three hundred men; rather with more, For that is all the main part of my care; Seeing as for Huntley, I assure myself He in our play shall henceforth bear no part But of an honest and a fearful man Whose thought and all his toil of heart it is To keep the load of treason from his name. Therefore I would not have my lord in all Trust or mistrust him, but be circumspect And take more power unto him. Paris. So shall I say; Your highness hath no message more for me? Queen. God wot no time it is for us to change Tokens and toys of love; yet I would send For very sorrow something but in sign That of my heart's grief I accuse not him For his cold writing or forgetfulness, His little memory of me and little care, And least of all his promise-breach, being now So far made his that what thing pleases him Is acceptable to me, and all my thoughts To his so willingly subdued, that all That comes of him proceeds of no such root, In mine esteem, as loveless negligence Nor any love's lack, but such only cause As I desire, being just and reasonable, Which is the final order he should take For his own surety and honour, who alone Is my life's stay for which I only will Preserve it, and without which in this world My soul desires not but a sudden death. Bear therefore to him for testimony of me How lowly I submit me to his law In sign of homage this that I take off Of my head's ornament, which is the chief And guide of other members, as to say How being possessed of that as of a spoil Which is the principal he needs must have The remnant subject to him with heart's consent. And for that heart, that seeing I have left it him Long since I have not now in hand to give, This stone instead I send him, painted black And sown with tears and bones, a sepulchre Whereto my heart is likened, being as it Carved like a tomb or certain receptacle To harbour his commandments in, and hold More fast than all his memory and his name Therein enclosed as in the ring my hair, To come forth never till the grant of death Shall let him rear a trophy of my bones, As is the ring full of them, set therein For sign he has made full conquest of my heart, That even the bones must be to him bequeathed For memory of his victory and my loss That was so sweet to me: tell him but this, And say that by the enamelling of black He shall discern her steadfastness who sends, And by the tears my fears innumerable Lest I displease him, and those tears I shed For his dear absence and for heart's disdain That I may not in outward shape be his As with full strength and heart and spirit I am, And with good cause; for were my merit more Than hers of all born ever for men's love Found worthiest and most perfect, and as much As I desire it might be in his eye, Well might I so rest ever, and shall strive Still to maintain me in his government As worthily as I may. Say, I beseech him That is mine only good, in as good part To take it at my hand as I at his With extreme joy received our marriage bond, That till the marriage of our bodies be Made publicly shall part not from my breast, Which keeps it now in sign of all the bliss I can or hope for or desire on earth: And that my letter here brake off for dread Lest this as much should weary him to read As I took joy to write it; therefore, say, Here did I set a kiss as on his hand With such devotion as I pray to God To give him long and blessed life, and me That only good of all which I desire And only may pretend to in the world, His love and his good favour who doth hold Alone my life up; and this trust I showed To you in whom I know the trust he hath As I shall for his sake whose wife I am, His humble and obedient lawful wife, To whom my heart and body are dedicate And shall in no wise unto death be changed Nor good nor evil make me go from it. So tell him, and despatch. [Exit Paris. What said Lord Mar Touching the child's charge to you? Mary Beaton. But thus much; That he would never let it from his hand Save with assent of the three several states, And on condition there shall be proclaimed Some honest lord and worthy such a charge. As captain of the castle of Edinburgh, Where only may the prince, he says, lie safe From them that slew his father. Queen. Ay, so brave? There speaks a man of trust, found honourable; I had as lief be dead as see such men Stand so at point to thwart me: by my life, I hold it not a straw's worth in the scale If I must live so shackled. What, and now, When my life trembles on the top of fate, And all my days hang from this edge of time 'Twixt night and light suspended, whence one hour May hurl all hopes down breathless to the pit And cast me broken at the mountain's foot Or set me sure and steadfast in the sun, To be so crossed of cozening honesties, And honours made of craft, and fraudulent faith, Would spur a blood more sluggish than my sleep And prick a drowsier passion. Well, let be; Our time will come to take all these in hand. What may doubt deem then I would do with him That am his mother? Nay, I know their thought; It is their fear and hatred of my lord That glares askant on me; and the child's self, I think, as little loves me as he need, Knowing in what love I held his father. Come, I will yet see, before I take my leave, If there be such a nature in our blood As can command and change the spiritual springs And motions of our thought, advance or check The pulse of purpose in the soul that moves Our longings and our loathings to their end By mere control and force unreasonable Of motionless compulsion; if such blind And sensual chances of the stirring veins That feed the heart of child or mother may Divert and dull the mind's design, or turn The conscience and the current of the will From its full course and action. I believe, Albeit I would not hurt the life I bare Nor shed its blood, it is not possible Such love should live between my child and me Who know what source he came of more than mine, And how that part of me once mixed therewith Was sullied thence and shamed in mine own sight, That loathes to look upon it, yet must see In flesh and blood the record writ and sealed As oft as I behold him: and you saw He would not lie within mine arm, nor kiss, But like a fox-cub scratched and strove, to be Free of my hands again. Mary Beaton. I see no need In heaven or earth why you should love him. Queen. No? They say such law there is to enforce such love On either part; I know not: but I think Love should but flower from seed of love, and this Was but a tare sown timeless and in hate; Yet so much am I mother in my mind That, be it for love or loathing, from my heart, When I perforce commend him to that care Which will not yield him naturally to mine, Fain would I parting know if soon or late Mine eyes shall turn upon that face again Which out of me was moulded, and take note, When each on each looks equal-eyed, and sees His crown a shadow that makes mine a shade, What king must this be and what queen shall I. Scene VIII. —Dunbar. A Room in the Castle. Maitland and Sir James Melville. Melville. What, have you seen them since we came from horse? How looks she now? Maitland. Disquieted and strange; And he so hot and high of mood, I think We have no safeguard from him but in her; And Huntley that at Stirling spake with me Of this their counsel, and must now suspect It was by me discovered to the lords, Will turn perforce his fear of Bothwell's wrath Into a sword to strike as straight as he Even at my life, it may be; which her grace Shall easilier from fear of them redeem Than her own fame from evidence of men, That seeing her prisoner see too if she came By force or no, and led by heart or hand, To bonds indeed or freedom. Melville. Nay, myself Was warned of him that rode in charge of me, The Laird here of Blackadder, how his lord Was of our lady's counsel; and but now As they rode in I heard him swear, and laugh, Who would soe'er or would not, in their spite, Yea, though herself she would not with her will, Yet should the queen perforce now wed with him. Maitland. The deed has flushed his brain and blood like wine; He is wroth and merry at once, as a man mad. There will no good come of it. Melville. Surely, sir, Of such loose crafts there cannot: all this land Will cry more loud upon her than on him If she be known consenting. Maitland. If she be! How shall not all ears know it on earth that hear? But two miles out of Edinburgh at noon, Accompanied of all her guard and us, She, meeting in mid road at Almond Bridge The unthought-on Bothwell at his horsetroop's head, Who with twelve men lays hand upon her rein, Yields herself to him for fear our blood be spilt, Or theirs or ours, for tenderness of heart Submits her to his violent masterdom, Forbids our swords, ties up all hands with words, And doglike follows hither at his hand For pure surprise and suddenness of fear That plucks the heart out of resistance; then, Riding beneath the south wall of the town, On show of summons to the castle sent For help of us enforced thus of our foes, We get but fire of guns charged full of sound With hay stuffed in for powder; and God knows Balfour knew naught of this, the governor, Who was forewarned not first of their design, How by no means to cross but further it With forecast of his office; nay, all this Was undevised and on the sudden wrought To take her by swift stroke of simple hand; And so astonied were we all, and so The castellan, and most of all the queen. Why, though the world be drunk with faith in lies, Shall God make this too gospel? From this day Shall she begin her ruin; with rent heart I see the ways wherethrough her life shall lie, And to what end; for never henceforth more Shall she get good or comfort of men's love, Nor power nor honour that a queen should have, Nor hap nor hope renewed in all her days. She has killed herself to take her kingdom off And give into strange keeping. Enter the Queen, Bothwell, and Huntley. Bothwell. Here he stands; This was the knave that was to baffle me; He shall die here. Huntley. I will not lose the part My sword should have in him: this hour and hand Shall cut off craft and danger. Stand, and die. Maitland. Is it the queen's will that pursues my life? Then let it strike, and end. Queen. I charge you, hold; I will not foully twice be forced of men To stand and stain mine eyes with sight of blood Shed of a friend, and guiltless. Hold I say. Bothwell. Stand by, for I will slay him. Queen. Slay me then, For I will fling my body on their points Before your swords shall find him; hark you, sir, [To Huntley. Whose father died my traitor in my sight, If one hair perish of my servant's head, You that had back your lands and goods but now Again shall lose them with your forfeit life For boot of this man's blood. Bothwell. Woman, give way. Queen. Give all your swords way toward me; let me bleed Ere this my friend that has been true to me: I swear he shall not. Maitland. Madam, for God's love Come you not in their peril; I am armed, If both not run upon me. Bothwell. Fool, I say, Give place, or I shall know not what I do; Make me not mad. Queen. I cannot fear you yet. Will you strike now? Bothwell. I should but do you right. Why thrust you in between me and this man Whom your heart knows for traitor, and whose tongue Crossed and betrayed our counsel to the lords? Had he his will, we should not stand to-day Here heart to heart, but you in ward of them, And I divided from you. Queen. My sweet lord, Let not your wrath confound my happiness; Stain not my fair and fortunate hour with blood Shed of a good man who shall serve us yet. It shall more help to have him live our friend Than fiftyfold slain of our enemies. Bothwell. Have your will's way: he cannot cross us now; I care not if he live. Maitland. I am bounden to you For so much grace. Queen. Vex not his mood again. To-morrow shall all friends be reconciled; To-night rest here in surety. Bothwell. Be it so. [Exeunt. Scene IX. —The same. The Queen, Bothwell, and the Archbishop of St. Andrew's. Queen. What counsel, father? if their league be made So soon and strong at Stirling, we had need Surely by this be fast in Edinburgh; We have sent thither freely as our friends Lord Huntley and James Melville, who were here As in our ward, not prisoners; every day Here lingering makes our enemies bitterer-tongued And our strange state more hazardous; myself More taxed for willing bondage, or my lord For violence done upon me. Archbishop. In my mind There is no mean of policy now but speed Nor surety but short counsel and stout heart. The lords at Stirling, while you put off time, Athol and Mar, and Morton with Argyle, Are sworn to crown the prince, and of his name Make to their cause a standard, if you cleave Still to my lord here, from whose violent hand With your own leave they fain would pluck you forth And keep your honour hurtless; but they see You will have no deliverance at their hands From him who, as they say, doth boast himself, If he may get your child once in his ward, To warrant him for ever in good time From all revenging of his father's death. Nay, it is bruited of them all about How you at parting would have given the boy An apple poisoned, which he put away, And dogs that ate it after swelled and died. Bothwell. The devil is in their lips; had I free way, Fire should seal up and sear them. Archbishop. So they talk; The very children's tongues are hot on you, And in their plays your shadowy action staged And phantoms raised of your presented deed; Boys that in Stirling's streets had made their game To act again the slaying of Darnley, so Were rapt with passion of the pastime feigned They well nigh slew the player that took on him Your part, my lord, as murderer, and came off Halfhanged indeed and breathless; this I hear, And more much weightier daily from that part Pointing the same way on you; sure it is, From France and England messengers desire To have the prince delivered to their charge As to be fostered for his surety's sake Of one or other, safelier so bestowed In foreign harbourage of a stranger court Than at the rough breast of his natural land; Such offer comes there of Elizabeth To those unquiet lords, but other aid They must of her not look for to their part Who stand against their sovereign. Now, since these Are dangers evident, and every day Puts more in them of dangerous, best it were, I think, to meet them warlike point to point, Your hands and powers made one, and multiplied By mutual force and faith; or you must part And each lose other, and yet be neither saved, Or presently with one sole face confront The many-mouthed new menace of the time, With divers heads deformed of enmities That roar and ravin in the night of state Made dim with factions; only majesty With light of bared and kindled brows and eyes Can face them to consume; do you but show Your soul as high as is your crown, and power As plain as is your cause, you shall enforce By resolution and a forthright will The obedience and the allowance of these men That would constrain you by the fear of them Within the limit of their leave. I say, Proclaim at once the fore-ordained divorce Between his sometime lady and my lord And hard thereon your marriage, as compelled By perilous instance of necessity At once to assure you of a husband's help And present strength in this your need, who stand Fenceless and forceless with no man for stay, And could desire none truer and worthier trust Than him whose service done and valiant name May warrant your remission of such fault As men lay on him for the seeming force With which unwillingly he stood constrained To save you even for love's sake from their hands Whence had not he redeemed you as by might They had done you worse wrong than he seemed to do. This shall excuse the speed that you put on And leave their hands no time to rise that would Prevent you, being unmarried; and your own, Forestalling them, shall take again and steer The helm of this land's general weal, else left To their cross guidance and false pilotage. Bothwell. By God, well said and counselled. Queen. All is well, Or shall, if but one thing be; and in you That lies alone of all men. Nay, you know it; Wrong me not now to ask. Bothwell. Wrong you not me, To cross my wit with riddles, which you know From no man's lips I love. Queen. I know not yet If there be nought on any lips that live Save mine that you love better: I can tell Too little of your likings. Bothwell. Be not wroth That thus much of them I desire you learn, And set your heart to it, once being schooled—fair queen, These are no chambering times, nor sit we here To sing love's catches counter-changed with words That cross and break in kisses: what you will, Be swift to speak, or silent. Queen. What I will? I will be sure there hangs about your heart No thought that bound it once to one cut off And yet may feed it with desire to share What is my treasure and my right to have With her most undeserving; which in you Were more than Jason's falsehood was, that gave To his new wife such vantage of his old As you give her of me, whose narrower heart Holds not a third part of the faith and love That my obedience bears you, though she wear Against my will such vantage in your sight, By my hard hap; yet would I think not so, Nor liken you to such a trustless man And miserable as he was, nor myself To one so wronged a woman, and being wronged In suffering so unpitiful as she. Yet you put in me somewhat of her kind That makes me like unto her in anything That touches you or may preserve you mine To whom alone you appertain, if that May be called mine by right appropriated Which should be won through faithful travail, yea, Through only loving of you as God knows I do and shall do all my days of life For pain or evil that can come thereof: In recompense of which and all those ills You have been cause of to me, and must think That I esteem no evils for your sake, Let not this woman with her heartless tears Nor piteous passion thrust me out of door Who should sit sole and secret in your heart. What hath she borne or I not borne for you, And would not bear again? or by what gift Have I set store or spared it that might go To buy your heart's love to me? have I found Empire or love of friends or pride or peace Or honour or safe life or innocence Too good things to put from me, or men's wrath, Terror or shame or hatred of mine own, Or breach of friends or kingdom's wreck or sin, Too fearful things to embrace and make them mine With as good will and joyous height of heart As hers who takes love in her prosperous arms And has delight to bridegroom? Have I not Loved all these for your sake, and those good things, Have I not all abhorred them? Would I keep One comfort or one harbour or one hope, One ransom, one resource, one resting-place, That might divide me from your danger, save This head whose crown is humbled at your foot From storm that smote on yours? Would I sleep warm Out of the wind's way when your sail was set By night against the sea-breach? Would I wait As might your wife to hear of you, how went The day that saw your battle, and hold off Till the cry came of fallen or conquering men To bid me mourn or triumph? Hath my heart Place for one good thought bred not of your good Or ill thought not depending on your ill? What hath she done that yours hath place for her Or time or thought or pity? Bothwell. What have I, That yours should fix on her untimely? Nay, Last year she was my wife and moved you not, And now she is turned forth naked of that name And stripped as 'twere to clothe you, comes this heat, And fear takes fire lest she turn back or I To thrust you forth instead: you are fair and fool Beyond all queens and women. Queen. There spake truth, For then you said, most loving. But indeed This irks me yet, this galls with doubt and fear, That even her plea to be divorced from you On some forepast adulterous charge, which proved She wins her asking, leaves your hand not loose By law to wed again, but your same deed Frees her from you and fetters you from me; Then stand we shamed and profitless; meseems God's very hand can loose not us and join Who binds and looses; though Buccleugh makes oath She was contracted to you first, and this No righteous marriage; though she plight her soul As she made proffer for our hope's sake; yea, Though you should bring a hundred loves to swear They had the firstlings of your faith, who kept No faith with any, nor will keep with me, God knows, and I, that have no warrant yet In my lord's word here which unweds you, being Matched with your cousin in the fourth degree, And no proof published if the Church's grace Were granted for it, or sought; no help of this, If your love give not warrant; and therein If she hath half or I have less than all, Then have I nothing of you. Speak to him; Bid him not break his faith, not this now mine; Plead for me with him, father, lest he lie And I too lose him; God shall pardon, say, What sin we do for love, or what for wrath, Or to defend us from the danger of men, But to me, me, say, if he be forsworn, That God shall not forgive it him nor I. Archbishop. Be not too careful to confound yourself; Those bonds are broken by God's leave and law; Make no fresh bonds of your own fears, to do What harm these do no more; he hath put her off: Rest there content. Queen. Nay, why should I then trust He shall not put off me in heart for her? Bothwell. Why, have your choice then, and mistrust; God's death! I had deemed I had learnt of women's witlessness Some little learning, yet I thought no more Than that it was but light as air, snow, foam, And all things light, not lighter. I would know What men hold foolish yet that hold you wise, If not your fear. Queen. Doth she not love you? Bothwell. Ay. Queen. Hath she not cause to hate, and doth not hate, Who sues to be put from you, for your fault Craves leave to be cut off, as I crave leave To take you from her hands, her gift? Bothwell. God knows; She may love, hate, or hate not neither love, Or both alike; I know not. Queen. But I know That you can love not. Nay, then help me, God! If I did know this I would kill myself. Yet to more proof I would I had put your heart Ere I gave up to it all the might of mine— Which is but feebleness. Well, we will go; There is no better counsel. Pardon me If my fear seem to wrangle with my faith; They are parts but of my love, that with itself Strives to be master of its grief and joy Lest either overbear it, and therewith Put out my life. Come; all things shall be well. Scene X. —Holyrood. Enter Herries and Sir James Melville. Herries. Is the work done? Melville. They are wedded fast; and now I think would one of them to free herself Give the right hand she hath given him. Herries. What, so soon? Came she as loth into the council-hall Or were her answers as compelled and strange? Melville. I have not seen for any chance till now So changed a woman in the face as she, Saving with extreme sickness. She was wed In her old mourning habits, and her face As deadly as were they; the soft warm joy That laughed in its fair feature, and put heart In the eyes and gracious lips as to salute All others' eyes with sweet regardfulness, Looked as when winds have worn the white-rose leaf; No fire between her eyelids, and no flower In the April of her cheeks; their spring acold, And but for want of very heart to weep They had been rainier than they were forlorn. Herries. And his new grace of Orkney? Melville. The good duke Was dumb while Adam Bothwell with grave lips Set forth the scandal of his lewd life past And fair faith of his present penitence, Whose days to come being higher than his past place Should expiate those gone by, and their good works Atone those evil; hardly twitched his eye Or twinkled half his thick lip's curve of hair, Listening; but when the bishop made indeed His large hard hand with hers so flowerlike fast, He seemed as 'twere for pride and mighty heart To swell and shine with passion, and his eye To take into the fire of its red look All dangers and all adverse things that might Rise out of days unrisen, to burn them up With its great heat of triumph; and the hand Fastening on hers so griped it that her lips Trembled, and turned to catch the smile from his, As though her spirit had put its own life off And sense of joy or property of pain To close with his alone; but this twin smile Was briefer than a flash or gust that strikes And is not; for the next word was not said Ere her face waned again to winter-ward As a moon smitten, and her answer came As words from dead men wickedly wrung forth By craft of wizards, forged and forceful breath Which hangs on lips that loath it. Herries. Will you think This was not haply but for show, to wear The likeness as of one not all constrained Nor all consenting, willingly enforced To do her will as of necessity? That she might seem no part yet of his plot, But as compelled by counsel of those lords Who since her coming have subscribed by name The paper of advice that in his cause Declares what force of friends has Bothwell here In Lothian and on all the border's march To keep good order, and how well it were She should for surety wed him whom she needs Must wed for honour or perforce live shamed By violence done upon her. Melville. No; there hung Too much of fear and passion on her face To be put off when time shall be to unmask; The fire that moved her and the mounting will While danger was and battle was to be, Now she hath leapt into the pit alive To win and wear the diamond, are no more; Hope feels the wounds upon its hands and feet That clomb and clung, now halting since the hour That should have crowned has bruised it. No, 'tis truth; She is heart-struck now, and labours with herself, As one that loves and trusts not but the man Who makes so little of men's hate may make Of women's love as little; with this doubt New-born within her, fears that slept awake, And shame's eyes open that were shut for love, To see on earth all pity hurt to death By her own hand, and no man's face her friend If his be none for whom she casts them off And finds no strength against him in their hands. Herries. Small strength indeed or help of craft or force Must she now look for of them; and shall find, I fear, no stay against men's spirits and tongues Nor shelter in the observance of their will That she puts on, submitting her own faith To the outward face of theirs, as in this act Of marriage, and the judgment now enforced Against the allowance of the mass, albeit With a bruised heart and loathing did she bow That royal head and hand imperious once To give so much of her soul's trust away; And little shall it stead her. Melville. So fear I; 'Tis not the warrant of an act affirmed Against the remnants of her faith, nor form Of this strange wedlock, shall renew to her Men's outworn love and service; nay, and strife Lies closer to her than fears from outward; these Whose swords and souls attend on her new lord, Both now for fault of pay grown mutinous, From flat revolt they hardly have redeemed With the queen's jewels and that English gift Of the gold font sent hither for the prince That served him not for christening, melted now To feed base hands with gold and stop loud throats, Whose strength alone and clamour put such heart In Bothwell that he swore to hang the man Who would not speak their banns at first, and now But utters them with lips that yet protest Of innocent blood and of adulterous bonds By force proclaimed, and fraudful; and this Craig The townsmen love, and heed not that for craft Each day will Bothwell hear men preach, and show To them that speak all favour, and will sit A guest at burghers' boards unsummoned; yet Men's hate more swells against him, to behold How by the queen he rides unbonneted And she rebukes his too much courtesy; So that their world within doors and without Swells round them doubtfully toward storm, and sees This hot-brained helmsman in his own conceit Even here in port, who drifts indeed at sea. Herries. Short time will wind this up: the secretary, Whose blood the queen would see not shed of him, Is slipped away for Stirling, there to join With Lindsay and the lords ere this combined, From whom I may not now divide myself, On the child's party. Not a hand will stay Nor heart upon this side; the Hamiltons, For their own ends that set this marriage on, Will for those ends with no sad hearts behold At others' hands her imminent overthrow. Melville. This was the archbishop's counsel, that annulled Last year's true marriage to procure the queen's And even therein betray her. God mend all! But I misdoubt me lest the sun be set That looked upon the last of her good days. Scene XI. —The same. The Queen and Bothwell; Mary Beaton and Arthur Erskine in attendance. Queen. Are you yet wroth? Bothwell. Are you yet wise? to know If I be wroth should less import than this Which I would fain find of you. Queen. By my life, I think I am but wise enough to know That witless I was ever. Bothwell. Ay, but most, You mean, to wed me, that am graceless more Than witless you that wedded, in men's eyes Who justliest judge of either; yet, by God, Had I not grace enough to match with you, I must have less than in their minds I have And tongues of them that curse me; but what grief Wrings now your heart or whets your tongue, that strikes When the heart stirs not? Queen. Nay, no grief it is To be cut off from all men's company, Watched like a thief lest he break ward by night, My chamber door set round with men-at-arms, My steps and looks espied on, hands and feet Fettered as 'twere with glances of strange eyes That guard me lest I stray; my ways, my words, My very sleep their subject. Bothwell. You were wont To walk more free; I wot you have seen fair days When you lived large i'the sun, and had sweet tongues To sing with yours, and haply lips and eyes To make song sweeter than the lute may; now 'Tis hard that you sit here my woeful wife, Who use you thus despitefully, that yet Was never queen so mated with a groom And so mishandled; have you said so? Queen. I? Bothwell. Who hath put these words else in men's mouths, that prate How you lie fast in prison? I did know A woman's tongue keen as her faith was light, But faith so like the wind spake never yet. With tongue so like a sword's point. Queen. No, my lord? 'Tis well that I should hear so first of you Who best may know the truth of your worst word. Bothwell. Is it no truth that men so speak, and you, By speech or silence or by change of face, By piteous eyes or angry, give them cause To babble of your bonds? What grace you show Toward others is as doubt and hate of me In these our enemies' sight, who see it and swear You are kept in ward here of my will, and made, Out of no trust or love but force and fear, Thrall to my hand. Why, being but two days wed, Must there be cause between us of dispute For such a thing as this man, in whose name I am crossed and slighted of your wanton will? Queen. If he be worth no more than you conceive, What grace I do him can hurt you? Bothwell. I conceive! Why, what worth is he with you, that I should Conceive the least thought of him? Were I hurt, Assure yourself it would be to his death; Lay that much to your heart. Queen. My heart is killed. I have not where to lay it. Bothwell. Pray you, no tears; I have seen you weep when dead men were alive That for your eye-drops wept their hearts' blood out; So will not I. You have done me foolish wrong And haply cast your fame for food to hounds Whose teeth will strip it hour by hour more bare Whereon they have gnawed before. Queen. What have I done? Speak. Bothwell. Nay, I will, because you know not: hark, You are even too simple and harmless; being man's wife, Not now the first time, you should buy more wit Though with less innocence; you have given a gift, Out of your maiden singleness of soul And eye most witless of misconstruing eyes, Where you should not: this is strange truth to you, But truth, God help us! that man's horse who was Your husband, and whose chattels, place, and name Lie in my hold I think now lawfully Whence none is like to wring them, have you given Out of my hand to one of whom fame saith That by the witness of a northland witch He when I die must wed you, and my life Shall last not half a year; for in your bed Must lie two husbands after me, and you Shall in your fifth lord's lifetime die by fire. Now, being but third and least in worth of these, I would not have you die so red a death, But keep you from all fresh or fiercer heat Than of my lips and arms; for which things' sake I am not blithe, so please you, to behold How straight this lay lord abbot of Arbroath Sits in your husband's saddle. Pardon me That with my jealous knowledge I confound Your virginal sweet ignorance of men's minds, Ill thoughts and tongues unmannerly, that strike At the pure heart which dreams not on such harm; It is my love and care of your life's peace Makes me thus venturous to wage words with you And put such troublous things in your fair mind, Whereof God wot you knew not: and to end, Take this much of me; live what life you may Or die what death, while I have part in you None shall have part with me; nor touch nor word Nor eye nor hand nor writing nor one thought The lightest that may hang upon a look Shall man get of you that I know not of And answer not upon him. Be you sure I am not of such fool's mould cast in flesh As royal-blooded husbands; being no king Nor kin of kings, but one that keep unarmed My head but with my hand, and have no wit To twitch you strings and match you rhyme for rhyme And turn and twitter on a tripping tongue, But so much wit to make my word and sword Keep time and rhyme together, say and slay. Set this down in such record as you list, But keep it surer than you keep your mind If that be changing: for by heaven and hell I swear to keep the word I give you fast As faith can hold it, that who thwarts me here, Or comes across my will's way in my wife's, Dies as a dog dies, doomless. Now, your pleasure; I prate no more. Queen. Shall I be handled thus? Bothwell. You have too much been handled otherwise; Now will I keep you from men's hands in mine, Or lack the use of these. Queen. What, to strike me? You shall not need; give me a knife to strike That I may let my life out in his eye, Or I will drown myself. Bothwell. Why, choose again; I cross you not. Queen. Give me a knife, I say. Arthur Erskine. Make not our hearts bleed, madam, as they burn To hear what we hear silent. Bothwell. Comfort her; You were her chamber-knight on David's day. Arthur Erskine. My lord, the reverence that the queen's sight bears And awe toward her make me thus slow to set My hand to do what work my heart bids; else I would not doubt to stand before your grace And make such answer as her servant may. Queen. Forbear him, Arthur; nay, and me; 'tis I On whom all strokes first fall and sorest smite, Who most of all am shieldless, without stay, And look for no man's comfort. Pray you, sir, If it be in your will that I cast off This heavy life to lighten your life's load That now with mine is laden, let me die More queenlike than this dog's death you denounce Against the man that falls into your hate; Though not for love, yet shame, because I was A queen that loved you: else you should not seem So royal in her sight whose eyes you serve, Nor she when I am dead with such high heart Behold you, nor with such glad lips commend As conqueror of me slain for her love's sake And servant of her living in your love. Let me die therefore queenlike, and your sword Strike where your tongue hath struck; though not so deep, It shall suffice to cleave my heart and end. Bothwell. Hear you, my queen; if we twain be one flesh, I will not have this daintier part of it Turn any timeless hand against itself To hurt me, nor this fire which is your tongue Shoot any flame on me; no fuel am I To burn and feed you; not a spark you shed Shall kindle me to ruin, but with my foot Rather will I tread out the light that was A firebrand for the death of many a man To light the pile whereon they burnt alive. What, have I taken it in my hand to scorch And not to light me? or hath it set fire To so few lives already that who bears Needs not to watch it warily and wake When the night falls about him? Nay, the man Were twice the fool that these your dead men were, Who seeing as I have seen and in his hand Holding the fire I carry through the dark To be the beacon of my travelling days And shine upon them ended, should not walk With feet and eyes both heedful at what hour By what light's leading on what ground he goes, And toward what end: be therefore you content To keep your flame's heat for your enemies' bale, And for your friend that large and liberal light That gave itself too freely, shot too far, Till it was closed as in a lantern up To make my path plain to me; which once lost, The light goes out for ever. Queen. Yea, I know; My life can be but light now to your life, And of no service else; or if none there, Even as you say, must needs be quenched; and would The wind that now beats on it and the sea Had quenched it ere your breath, and I gone out With no man's blood behind me. Bothwell. Come, be wise; Our sun is not yet sunken. Queen. No, not yet; The sky must even wax redder than it is When that shall sink; darkness and smoke of hell, Clouds that rain blood, and blast of winds that wreck, Shall be about it setting. Bothwell. What, your heart Fails you now first that shrank not when a man's Might well at need have failed him? Queen. Ay, and no; It is the heart that fired me fails my heart, And as that bows beneath it so doth mine Bend, and will break so surely. Bothwell. Nay, not mine; There is not weight yet on our adverse part, Fear not, to bend it. Queen. Yet it fails me now. I have leant too much my whole life's weight on it With all my soul's strength, and beneath the fraught I hear it split and sunder. Let me rest; I would fain sleep a space now. Who goes there? Mary Beaton. A suitor to behold your majesty. Queen. I will not see him. Who should make suit to me? Who moves yet in this world so miserable That I can comfort? or what hand so weak It should be now my suppliant, or uplift In prayer for help's sake to lay hold on mine? What am I to give aid or alms, who have No alms nor aid at hand of them to whom I gave not some but all part of myself? I will not see him. Mary Beaton. It is a woman. Queen. Ay? But yet I think no queen; and cannot be But therefore happier and more strong than I. Yet I will see what woman's face for grief Comes to seek help at mine; if she be mad, Me may she teach to lose my wits and woes And live more enviable than ye that yet Have wit to know me wretched. Enter Jane Gordon. Who is this? Are you my suitor? Jane Gordon. I am she that was Countess of Bothwell; now my name again Is that my father gave me. Queen. Ay, no more; You are daughter yet and sister to great earls, And bear that honour blameless; be it enough; And tell me wherefore by that name you come And with what suit before me. Jane Gordon. Even but this, To look once on you and to bid farewell Ere I fare forth from sight. Queen. Farewell; and yet I know not who should in this world farewell. Is the word said? Jane Gordon. A little leave at last I pray you give me: that I seek it not For love or envy toward my sometime lord Or heart toward you disloyal now my queen, Let me not plead uncredited. I came Surely with no good hope to no glad end, But with no thought so vile of will as this, To thrust between your hearts the care of me Claim right or challenge pity, melt or fret Your eyes with forced compassion: I did think To have kissed your hand and something said for sign I had come not of weak heart or evil will, But in good faith, to see how strong in love They stand whose joy makes joyless all my life, Whose loving leaves it loveless, and their wealth Feeds full upon my famine. Be not wroth; I speak not to rebuke you of my want Or of my loss reprove you, that you take My crown of love to gild your crown of gold; I know what right you have, and take no shame To sit for your sake humbled, who being born A poor mean woman would not less have been By God's grace royal, and by visible seal A natural queen of women; but being crowned You make the throne imperial, and your hand Puts power into the sceptre; yea, this head Of its gold circlet takes not majesty But gives it of its own; this may men see, And I deny not; nor is this but just, That I, who have no such honour born or given, Should have not either, if it please you not, That which I thought I had; the name I wore, The hand scarce yet a year since laid in mine, The eye that burned on mine as on a wife's, The lip that swore me faith, the heart that held No thought or throb wherein I had no part, Or heaved but with a traitor's breath, and beat With pulse but of a liar. Bothwell. Ay, swore I so? Why, this was truth last year then. Queen. Truth, my lord? What does the fire of such a word as this Between such lips but burn them, as mine ears Burn that must hear by your device and hers With what strange flatteries on her prompted lips This dame unwedded lifts her hand unringed To abash me with its show of faith, and make Your wife ashamed at sight of such a love As yet she bears you that is not your wife? Bothwell. What devil should prick me to such empty proof And pride unprofitable? I pray you think I am no such boy to boast of such a spoil As chamberers make their brag of. Let her speak And part not as unfriends. Queen. Madam, and you That thus renumber and resound his vows, To what good end I know not, in our ear, What would you have of him whom your own will Rose up to plead against as false, to break His bonds that irked you and unspeak the word That held you hand in hand? Did you not pray To be set free from bondage, and now turn To question with the hand that you put off If it did well to loose you? Jane Gordon. Truly, no; Nor will I question with your grace in this, Whether by mine own will and uncompelled I only would have put that hand away That I will say would yet have held mine fast But for my frowardness and rancorous mind; Let all this even be so; as he shall say Who will say nought but with your queenly will, Why, so will I. Yet ere I am gone, my lord— O, not my lord, but hers whose thrall am I— My sometime friend and yet not enemy, If this thing not offend you, that I crave So much breath of you as may do me right, I pray you witness for me how far forth And for what love's sake I took part with you Or gave consent to our devised divorce, And if this were for hate; for you should know How much of old time I have hated you, How bitter made my heart, what jealous edge Set on mine envy toward you; spare not then To say if out of cold or cankered heart I sought, or yielded shamefully for spite, To be divided from you. Nay, forbear; Speak not, nor frown on me; you cannot say I was your loveless or disloyal wife, Or in my void bed on disconsolate nights Sought comfort but of tears: nor that I held Mine honour hurt of that which bruised my heart, And grudged to help you to mine own most wrong And lend you mine own hand to smite myself And make you by mine own mouth quit of me. This that I did, and wherefore I did this, And if for love's or hate's sake, verily You shall not say you know not, and the queen Shall blame me not to put you yet in mind, Nor think it much that I make record here Of this that was between us: wherefore now I take no shame at this my leave-taking To part as one that has not erred herein, To love too little; this shall not be said When one bethinks him such a woman was, That with poor spirit or with contracted heart I gave myself to love you, or was found Too mean of mind or sparing of my soul To cast for love the crown of love away, And when you bade refuse you for my lord, Whom, had you bidden, with my whole heart's blood I had thought not much to purchase for my love: But seeing nor blood nor all my body's tears Might buy you back to love me, I was fain That you should take them and my very life To buy new love and life with. Sir, and now Ere we twain part— Queen. What, are ye parted not? Between his lover and my lord I stand And see them weep and wrangle ere they part, And hold my peace for pity! Jane Gordon. God shall judge If with pure heart and patience, or with soul That burns and pines, I would have said farewell; I crave but this much of your grace and God's, Make me at last not angry. Queen. Have you held No counsel or communion with my lord Since—I am shamed that take upon my lips Such inquisition. If you have aught yet, speak; I bid not nor forbid you. Jane Gordon. Nought but this; To unpledge my faith, unplight my love, and so Set on his hand the seal by touch of mine That sunders us. Queen. You shall not take his hand. Jane Gordon. I think not ever then to touch it more, Nor now desire, who have seen with eyes more sad More than I thought with sorrowing eyes to see When I came hither; so this long last time Farewell, my lord; and you, his queen, farewell. [Exit. Queen. Hath she made end? while I have part in you, None shall have part with me, was this my lord, Was this not you that said so? Bothwell. Come, enough; I am bound not to be baited of your tongues. Queen. Bid her come back. Bothwell. What, are you foolish? think You twain shall look in either's eyes no more. Queen. Why should I look in yours to find her there? For there she sits as in a mirror shown By the love's light enkindled from your heart, That flashed but on me like a fen-fire lit To lure me to my grave's edge, whence I fall Deep as the pit of hell; but yet for shame Deny not her to me as me to her, Me that have known this ever, but lacked heart To put the thing to use I knew; and now For both our sakes who have loved you, play not false But with one love at once; take up your love And wear it as a garland in men's sight, For it becomes you; if you love me not You have lied by this enough; speak truth, shake hands, Loose hearts and leave me. Bothwell. Vex not me too long, Vexing your own heart thus with vanity; Take up your wisdom that you have at will, And wear it as a sword in danger's sight That now looks hard upon us. Mine you are, Love me or love not, trust me not or trust, As yours am I; and even as I in you, Have faith in me, no less nor further; then We shall have trust enough on either part To build a wall about us at whose foot That sea of iron swayed by winds of war Shall break in foam like blood; and hurled once back, The hearts and swords of all our enemies fallen Lie where they fell for ever. Know but this, And care not what is unknown else; we twain Have wrought not out this fortune that we have Nor made us way to such an hour and power To let men take and break it, while as fools We kiss and brawl and cry and kiss again, And wot not when they smite. For these next days, We will behold the triumph held at Leith And pageant of a sea-fight as set forth With open face and spirit of joyousness To fix this faith in all men's eyes and minds, That while life lives we stand indissoluble: Then shall you send out for your child again Forth of Lord Mar's good keeping, that your heart May here have comfort in his present sight; So shall all these who make his name their sword Lie weaponless within our hand and hold, Who are drawn in one against us, or prepare, While we delay, for Stirling; where by this, I am certified on faith of trusty men, Argyle is met with Morton, our good friends That served us for their turn, with some that helped To make our match and some that would have marred, Once several-souled, now in their envies one, As Lindsay, Athol, Herries; and to these Maitland is fled, your friend that must not bleed, Your counsellor is stolen away and lives To whet his wit against you; but myself, When we have shown us to the people, and seen What eye they turn upon our marriage feast, Will ride to Melrose, and raise up from sleep Their hardy hearts whom now mine unfriends there Hold in subjection; Herries nor Lord Hume Nor Maxwell shall have power to tie them up When I shall bid them forth, and all the march Shall rise beneath us as with swell o'the sea And wash of thickening waters when the wind Makes the sea's heart leap with such might of joy As hurls its waves together; there shall we Ride on their backs as warriors, and our ship Dance high toward harbour. Put but on the spirit You had in all times that beset your peace, Since you came home, with danger; in those wars That made the first years clamorous of your reign, And in this past and perilous year of ours Where you lacked never heart. Be seen again The royal thing men saw you; these your friends Shall look more friendly on our wedded faith Seeing no more discord of our days to be, And our bold borderers with one heart on fire Burn in your warlike safeguard, once to strike And end all enemies' quarrel. When we part, At Borthwick Castle shall you look for me, Where I will gather friends more fain of fight Than all our foes may muster. Queen. Sir, so be it; But now my heart is lower than once it was, And will not sit I think again so high Though my days turn more prosperous than I deem. But let that be. Come, friends, and look not sad Though I look sadder; make what cheer we may, For festival or fight, or shine or shower, I will not fail you yet. God give me heart, That never so much lacked it; yea, he shall, Or I will make it out of mine own fears And with my feebleness increase my force And build my hope the higher that joy lies low Till all be lost and won. Lead you, my lord, And fear not but I follow; I have wept When I should laugh, and laughed when I should weep, And now live humbler than I thought to be; I ask not of your love, but of mine own I have yet left to give. Come, we will see These pageants or these enemies; my heart Shall look alike on either. Be not wroth; I will be merry while I live, and die When I have leave. My spirit is sick; would God We were now met at Borthwick, with men's spears And noise of friends about us; friend or foe, I care not whether; here I am sore at heart, As one that cannot wholly wake nor sleep Till death receive or life reprieve me. Come; We should be glad now; let the world take note We are glad in spite and sight of enmities That are but worth the hour they take to quell. Scene XII. —Stirling Castle. Maitland and Lindsay. Lindsay. Is there such breach between them? why, men said, When they would ride through Edinburgh and he Bare-headed at her bridle, she would take By force and thrust his cap upon his head With loving might and laughing; and at Leith They saw the false fight on the waters join And mid-May pageants that shone down the sun, As with glad eyes of lovers newly wed Whose hearts were of the revel; and so soon Are hearts and eyes divided? Maitland. Not an hour May she draw breath but in his eye, nor see But whom he shall give entrance: in her sight He thought to have slain me, but she came between And set for shield her bosom to his sword In her own chamber; so each day and night By violent act or viler word than deed He turns her eyes to water-springs of tears, Who leaves not yet to love him; such stronghold By flesh or spirit or either made one fire Hath such men's love on women made as she, For no foul speech I think nor strokes nor shame Would she go from him, but to keep him fast Would burn the world with fire; and no force less Shall burn their bonds in sunder. Lindsay. We will bring And kindle it in their sight. They are southward fled To meet at Borthwick; thither we design, To raise the Merse with Hume, and with Lord Mar And with the Douglas' following bind them round And take them in one snare, whence one of these Shall creep not forth with life or limb that feels No hound's fang fasten on it; and his mate Shall see their feet smoke with his slaughtered blood. Scene XIII. —Borthwick Castle. The Queen and Bothwell; Mary Beaton in attendance. Queen. You should be hence again: since you came in From Melrose with no levies at your back, We have heard no news of friends, and hear but now That we are ringed with Morton's folk about; How shall he not have laid unhappy hand Upon your messenger that bare our word Of summons to the archbishop and your friend Balfour to be with Huntley at our side? Bothwell. Ay, he is trapped that bore my letters hence, I doubt not; none have feet to run aright, Eyes to see true, hands to bring help, but they That move them to our ruin. This Balfour, Whom I laid trust on since our fiery night As on a true man bound of force to me, Has fallen in conference and device of plots, I hear, with that lean limb of policy That loves me not, James Melville, by whose mouth Being warned I meant to take out of his hand The castle-keys of Edinburgh and give To one my closer kinsman for more trust, He has made him friends of ancient foes, and seeks, By no less service than pursuit of them Who slew the king your husband, to deserve Their favour who are risen of honest heart But to chastise these slayers, of whom God wot Themselves were none, nor he that hunts with them Upon the trail of treason. O, your lords Are worthy friends and enemies, and their tongues As trusty as their hands are innocent, When they see time to turn. Queen. I would their lives Lay all between my lips, and with one breath I might cut all their off! nor tongue nor hand Should rise of them against us, to deny Their work disclaimed when done. What slaves are these That make their hands red with men's secret blood And with their tongues would lick them white, and wash The sanguine grain out with false froth of words From lying lips that kissed the dead to death And now cry vengeance for him? But, my lord, Make you haste hence to-night ere they be here That if we tarry will beset us; I Should hang but as a fetter on your foot, Which should pass free forth to Dunbar, and raise With sound even of its tread and forward speed The force of all the border. Bothwell. Where I go, There shall you not be far to find; to-night I will sleep here. Queen. God give you rest and strength, To make that heart which is the lord of mine Fresh as the spirit of sunrise! for last night You slept not well. Bothwell. No; I had dreams, that am No natural dreamer; I will sleep apart, With Cranston's son to lie at hand, or wait If I lack service. Queen. Nay, let me be there; I will not weary you with speech, nor break Your sleep with servile and officious watch, But sit and keep it as a jewel is kept That is more dear than eyesight to its lord, Or as mine eyes can keep not now their own, Now slumber sits far from them. Let me wake. Bothwell. No, not with me. Queen. What, lest I trouble you? Should my being there put dreams in you again, To cross your sleep with me? Bothwell. Belike it might. Queen. Nay, I was no part of your dreams, I think; You dream not on me waking nor asleep, But if you dream on no face else nor mine, I will be yet content. Bothwell. Well, so it was, I dreamt at once of either; yet I know not Why I should tell my dream; your lord that was, They say, would prattle of his fears by night And faces of false peril; I was never So loth by day to face what fear I might As to be sick in darkness; but this dream I would not see again. Yet was it nought; I seemed to stand between two gulfs of sea On a dark strait of rock, and at my foot The ship that bore me broken; and there came Out of the waves' breach crying of broken men And sound of splintering planks, and all the hull Shattered and strewn in pieces; and my head Was as my feet and hands, bare, and the storm Blew hard with all its heart upon me; then Came you, a face with weeping eyes, and hair Half glimmering with a broken crown that shone Red as of molten iron; but your limbs Were swathed about and shrouded out of sight, Or shown but as things shapeless that the bier Shows ready for the grave; only the head Floated, with eyes fast on me, and beneath A bloodlike thread dividing the bare throat As with a needle's breadth, but all below Was muffled as with cerecloths; and the eyes Wept; then came one we wot of clad in black And smiling, and laid hands on me more cold Than is a snake's kiss or the grave's, and thrust Between that severed head, weeping and crowned, That mourned upon me, and mine eyes that watched, Her own strange head wrapped widow-like and wan In habit of one sorrowing, but with lips That laughed to kiss me; and therewith at once Your face as water flowed out of my sight, And on mine own I felt as drops of blood Falling, but if your tears they were or hers Or either's blood I knew not; on mine eyes The great dead night shut doorwise like a wall, And in mine ears there sprang a noise of chains And teeth ground hard of prison-grates that jarred And split as 'twere with sound my heart, which was As ice that cleaves in sunder: for there came Through that black breathless air an iron note Of locks that shut and sounded, and being dumb There left me quick entombed in stone, and hid Too deep for the day's eyeshot; then I woke With the sea's roaring and the wind's by night Fresh in my sense, and on my travailing heart A weight of walls and floors and upper earth That held me down below the breach o'the sea Where its tide's wash kept witness overhead How went the scornful days and nights above Where men forgot me and the living sun As a dead dog passed over. Queen. What, alone? She went not with you living underground To sit in chains and hear the sea break? nay, She would not cast you off. This was your love, Your love of her and need of her sweet sight, That brought her so upon your sleep, and made Your sense so fearful of all things but this, And all else heard and seen so terrible But her face only: she should comfort you, Whom I should bring to wreck; why, so she said, Saying how she had loved you whom I loved not; yea, Her eyes were sad, she said, that saw forsooth So little love between us: this sweet word, This word of hers at parting, this it was Of which your dream was fashioned, to give sign How firm she sits and fast yet in your heart, Where I was never. Bothwell. Well, how be it soe'er, I would not dream again this dead dream out For less than kingly waking: so good night, For I will sleep alone. Queen. No, with my heart, That lies down with you though it sleeps not. Go, And dream of no less loving prayer than mine That calls on God for sleep to comfort you And keep your heart from sense of aught more hard Than her great love who made it. [Exit Bothwell. 'Tis a night That puts our France into my mind; even here By those warm stars a man might call it June, Were such nights many: their same flower-bright eyes Look not more fair on Paris, that mine own Again shall hardly look on. Is it not strange That in this grey land and these grievous hours I should so find my spirit and soul transformed And fallen in love with pain, my heart that was Changed and made humble to his loveless words And force as of a master? By my faith, That was till now fixed never and made as fire To stand a sunlike star in love's live heaven— A heaven found one in hue and heat with hell— I had rather be mishandled as I am Of this first man that ever bound me fast Than worshipped through the world with breaking hearts That gave their blood for worship. I am glad He sometime should misuse me; else I think I had not known if I could love or no. If you could love man with my heart as now, You would not mock nor marvel. Mary Beaton. No, not then. Queen. It is not in your heart: there lies not power In you to be for evil end or good The strange thing that is I. Mary Beaton. There does not, no, Nor can lie ever: could I love at all, It were but as mean women, meanly; so I do the best to love not. Queen. Hark! what noise? Look forth and see. Mary Beaton. A sound of men and steeds; The ring is round us; hark, the cry of Hume, There Lindsay, and there Mar. Queen. Call up my lord: I will not go to vex him; but do you Haste and awake them. [Exit Mary Beaton. Be it not in mine eyes That he first sees death risen upon his sleep, If we must die; being started out of rest, If he should curse me, were my heart not slain With the opening of his eyes in wrath on mine? Re-enter Mary Beaton. Mary Beaton. My lord is raised and fled; but in the press The lord of Cranston's son that slept with him Is fallen by flight into the enemy's hands, Who cry out for him yet as hounds that quest, And roar as on their quarry. Queen. Fled, and safe? Mary Beaton. Ay, past their hands' reach that had rent him else; Be sure he is forth, and free, or you should hear More triumph in these cries. Queen. God, thou art good! Fling wide the window: I will know of them If they be come to slay me.—What, my lords! Are all these men of mine that throng by night To make such show of service, and present Strange offices of duty? Where are ye That are chief ushers to their turbulent love Who come thus riotously to proffer it? Which is first here? a bold man should he be That takes unbidden on him such desert— Let me not say, a traitor. Lindsay (without). Where is he, The traitor that we seek? for here is none But in your bosom. Queen. Here then ends your search, For here am I; and traitors near enough I see to pierce the bosom that they seek, Where never shall be treason till its blood Be spilt by hands of traitors that till now Durst never rise so near it. Lindsay. Give him forth, Or we will have these walls down. Queen. What, with words? Is there such blast of trumpets in your breath As shook the towers down of the foes of God At the seventh sounding? yet we stand and laugh That hear such brave breath blown and stormlike speech Fly round our ears: is it because your war, My lords, is waged with women, that ye make Such woman's war on us? Mar (without). Madam, we come To take you from his hand that is your shame, And on his shameful head revenge that blood Which was shed guiltless; hither was he fled, We know, into your shelter: yield him up, Ere yet worse come than what hath worst come yet. Queen. There is none here to die by you but I, And none to mock you dying. Take all your swords It is a woman that they came to slay, And that contemns them; go not back for fear; Pluck up your hearts; one valiant stroke or twain, And ye are perfect of your work, and I For ever quit of treason; and I swear, By God's and by his mother's name and mine, Except ye slay me presently, to have Such vengeance of you and my traitors all As the loud world shall ring with; so to-night Be counselled, and prevent me, that am here Yet in your hands; if ye dare slay me not, Ye are dead now here already in my doom: Take heart, and live to mock it. Mar. He is fled. Here boots us not to tarry, nor change words With her that hath such vantage as to know We have missed our prize and purpose here, which was To take the traitor that is fled, and bring Whither we now ride foiled, to Edinburgh, Thence to return upon them. Lindsay. Hear yet once; You, madam, till our day be set of doom, Look to the adulterer's head that hence is flown, Whose shame should now stand redder in your face Than blushes on his hand your husband's blood, And cleave more fast; for that dead lord's revenge Will we make proclamation, and raise up The streets and stones for vengeance of your town That sits yet sullied with bloodguiltiness Till judgment make it clean; whose walls to-night Myself for fault of better ere I sleep Will scale though gates be fastened, and therein Bring back and stablish justice that shall be A memory to the world and unborn men Of murder and adultery. Queen. Good my lord, We thank you for the care you have and pains To speak before you smite; and that so long, The deed can follow not on the swift word For lack of spirit and breath to mate with it; So that they know who hear your threat betimes What fear it bears and danger, and for fear Take counsel to forestall it. Make good speed; For if your steed be shod but with fleet speech Ere you shall stride the wall of our good town Its foot may trip upon a traitor's grave. Mary Beaton. They ride fast yet; hear you their starting cry? Queen. For each vile word and venomous breath of theirs I will desire at my lord's hand a head When he shall bring them bound before my foot. If thou hast counsel in thee, serve me now: I must be forth, and masked in such close wise As may convey me secret to his side Whence till our wars be done I will not part Nor then in peace for ever: in this shape I should ride liable to all eyes and hands That might waylay me flying; but I will play As in a masque for pastime, and put on A horseboy's habit or some meaner man's That wears but servant's steel upon his thigh And on his sleeve the badge but of a groom, And so pass noteless through toward Haddington Whither my lord had mind to flee at need And there expect me. Come; the night wears out; The shifting wind is sharper than it was, And the stars falter. Help me to put off This outward coil of woman; my heart beats Fast as for fear a coward's might beat, for joy That spurs it forth by night on warriors' ways And stings it with sharp hope to find his face That shall look loving on me, and with smiles Mock the false form and cheer the constant heart That for his love's sake would be man's indeed. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. JOHN KNOX. Time: June 15 and 16, 1567. Scene I. —Carberry Hill. The Queen, Bothwell, and Soldiers. Queen. I would this field where fate and we must cross Were other than it is; but for this thought, On what ill night some score of years ago Here lay our enemy's force before that fight Which made next day the face of Scotland red And trod her strength down under English feet, I would not shrink in this wide eye of dawn, In the fair front of such a summer's day, To meet the mailed face of my traitors' host And with bared brows outbrave it. Bothwell. Keep that heart, For fear we need it; look beyond the bridge There at this hill's foot on the western bank How strong they stand under the gathering light; I have not seen a battle fairer set Or in French fields or these our thirstier lands That feed unslaked on blood. Queen. They grow now green, These hills and meadows that with slain men's lives Have fed the flocks of war; come ten years yet, And though this day should drench them with more death Than that day's battle, not a stain shall stand On their fresh face for witness. Had God pleased To set a strong man armed with hands to fight And on his head his heritage to keep, Sworded and crowned a king, in my sad stead, To fill the place I had not might to hold, And for the child then bitterly brought forth. Unseasonable, that being but woman born Broke with the news her father's heart, who died Desperate in her of comfort, had he sent The warrior that I would be, and in time To look with awless eye on that day's fight That reddened with the ruin of our hopes The hour that rocked my cradle, who shall say The scathe of Pinkie Cleugh and all that blood Had made the memory so unfortunate Of that which was my birth-time? Being a man, And timelier born to better hap than mine, I might have set upon that iron day Another mark than signs it in our sight Red with reproach for ever. Bothwell. Ay, my queen? These four nights gone you met me soldierlike Escaped from Borthwick, whence I brought you in, Three darkling hours past midnight, to Dunbar, Where you put off that sheath of fighting man For this poor woman's likeness yet you wear, Wherein you rode with your six hundred men To meet at Haddington but two days since These sixteen hundred border folk I led And pass with me to Seyton; did you find Your life more light in you or higher your heart Inside that habit than this woman's coat That sits so short upon you? Queen. By my life, I had forgot by this to be ashamed Of the strange shape I ride in, but your tongue Smites my cheek red as is this scanted weed Wherein I mask my queenship; yet God knows I had liefer ride thus forth toward such a day Than hide my sick heart and its fears at home In kinglier garments than this mask of mine, Thus with my kirtle kilted to the knee Like girls that ride in poor folks' ballads forth For love's sake and for danger's less than mine. Yet had I rather as your henchman ride At your right hand and hear your bridle ring Than sit thus womanly to watch men strike. Bothwell. There will be parleying first; I have word of this, That they set forth at heaviest of the night From Edinburgh to cross our march betimes, And by the French ambassador your friend At Musselburgh were overtaken, whence We look for news by him what hearts they bear, What power and what intent; he hath ta'en on him To stand between our parts as mediator And bear the burden of our doubtful peace; We must fight mouth to mouth ere hand to hand, But the clean steel must end it. Queen. Now would God I had but one day's manhood, and might stand As king in arms against this battle's breach A twelve hours' soldier, and my life to come Be bounded as a woman's; all those days That must die darkling should not yet put out The fiery memory and the light of joy That out of this had lightened, and its heat Should burn in them for witness left behind On those piled ashes of my latter life. O God, for one good hour of man, and then Sleep or a crown for ever! Bothwell. By God's light, The man that had no joy to strike for you Were such a worm as God yet never made For men to tread on. Kiss me; by your eyes And fiery lips that make my heart's blood hot, I swear to take this signet of your kiss As far into the fight as man may bear, And strike as two men in mine arm and stroke Struck with one sense and spirit. Queen. If I might change But this day with you in your stead to strike And you look on me fighting, as for me You have fought ere this last heat so many a prize, Or for your own hand ere your own was mine, I would pray God for nought again alive. But since my heart can strike not in my hand, Fight you for me; put on my heart to yours, And let the might of both enforce your arm With more than its own manhood and that strength Which is your natural glory. Bothwell. Sweet, I think, When we have rid through this day's wrath, if God Shall give us peace and kingdom and long life And make them fruitful to us, we shall bring forth A brood of kings as lions. Now in brief If this shall be or shall not may we know, For look where yonder facing to the sun Comes up to usward from the under field One with a flag of message; in mine eye It is the Frenchman. Queen. I will meet him here; Here will I sit upon this rock for throne And give such audience as my fortune may; Either the last that shall salute me queen Or first of my new reign, that from this day Shall fearfully begin for them whose fear Till now has held me shackled, and my will Confined of theirs unqueenly. Bothwell. I meantime Will see our line in order; for this truce Must hold not long; I would our hosts should meet Before the heat strikes of the middle day And this June sun drop on our soldiers' heads Or shoot their eyes out. [Exit. Queen. If God give us peace! Yet though he give and we twain see good days, I would not lose for many fortunate years And empire ringed with smooth security The sharp and dangerous draught of this delight That out of chance and peril and keen fear Springs as the wine out of the trampled grape To make this hour sweet to my lips, and bid My dancing heart be like a wave in the sun When the sea sways between the sun and wind As my sense now between the fears and hopes That die to-day for ever. O, this doubt That is not helpless but has armour on And hands to fight with, has more joy withal And puts more spirit into the flesh of life, More heart into the blood and light in the eyes, Than the utter hour of triumph, and the fight More than the prize is worth man's prizing; yea, For when all's won all's done, and nought to do Is as a chain on him that with void hands Sits pleasureless and painless. I had rather Have looked on Actium with Mark Antony Than bound him fast on Cydnus. O my hour, Be good to me, as even for the doubt's sake More than safe life I love thee; yet would choose Not now to know, though I might see the end, If thou wilt be good to me; do thy work, Have thine own end; and be thou bad or good, Thou shall nor smite nor crown a queen in heart Found lesser than her fortune. Enter Du Croc. Now, my lord, What is their will who by such sovereign show Should be my lords indeed? if you that came 'Twixt crown and crown ambassador pass now Between our camps on message: but this day Shall leave in Scotland but one sovereignty To see that sun sink. Du Croc. Madam, from the lords I come on errand but for love and fear That move me toward your highness; on whose part I reasoning with them of their faith to you And bond wherein their loyalties should live, By counsel of the laird of Lethington, Was charged to bear you from them present word For what they stand against your sight in arms, And will not but by force of yours dissolve Till it be granted. Queen. Speak, my lord; I know Your heart is whole and noble as their faith Is flawed and rotten; no disloyal word Shall make your tongue disloyal in mine ear, Speaking for them. Du Croc. This is their whole demand; That from the bloody hand which holds your own You pluck it forth and cast him from your sight To judgment who now stands through you secure And makes his weapon of your wounded name And of your shame his armour; and to him They offer fight with equal hand to hand Of noble seconds in what sum he will To match in blood and number with his own, If so he list to meet their chosen of men In personal battle, backed with less or more Or singly sworded; but this much they swear, They had rather make their beds in the earth alive Than yet sit still and let this evil be. And on your own part I beseech your grace Set not your heart against the hearts of these Lest it be broken of them, but betimes Call yet to mind what grief and shame will be Among your friends in France and all our part To see you so with this man's hap inwound That in his fall you cast yourself away And hand in hand run on with him to death. Queen. They are all forsworn that seek his death; all they With these blown tongues now questing for his blood By judgment set him free as innocence, And now take back the doom they gave, and turn On their own heads the lie: devise such shame As lewd folk loathe, to gird themselves withal And wear it for a jewel; seek and set The name of liar upon them like a crown, And bind about them as a coat and cloak Plain treason and ungilded infamy, Bare as a beggar; let them sue for grace, Kneel here and ask me favour; save as thus I treat not with them. Say how I sit here In this mean raiment, on this naked stone, Their queen to judge them, and with heart to weigh Their fault against my mercy; which yet once, Though hardly their submission may deserve, Say, haply they may find. Re-enter Bothwell. Bothwell. Good day, my lord. You look far off upon me; by your brow And strange-eyed salutation I may read The burden of your this day's embassy. Is it but I whom all these ranked in arms Are come against to battle? Du Croc. Ay, my lord; No hand is raised there dangerous to the queen Nor thought of heart not loyal. Bothwell. Why to me? What hurt have I done to them? none of these But would be gladly in my place, who had The heart to seek it; 'tis the braver man That ever fortune follows: what I hold I have won not basely, but from forth her hand Have ta'en it manlike, and with spirit as good Have girt me to maintain it. For my part, I seek no bloodshed, but in single field Will meet with whom their lot shall fall upon That shall be found fair champion on their part To bear the general quarrel; and to this My state and present name shall be no bar, But the queen's consort as her man shall fight In any good cause simply with God's help With any sword that shames not mine to meet. Queen. It is my cause; me must they strike or none; Myself am all the quarrel; let them yield Or give me battle. Bothwell. Then, no need of words; Let but your excellency stand here by And see the show as once that envoy bound 'Twixt Hannibal and Scipio; by God's grace This too shall be worth sight and good report If he not fail us. Du Croc. Madam, with rent heart Must I take leave then of you. Queen. Sir, farewell: I pray you say not that you saw me weep; These tears are not to turn the sword's edge soft Nor made of fear nor pity; but my heart Holds no more rule on my rebellious eyes Than truth on those my traitors; yet I trust Again to bring both under. [Exit Du Croc. Bothwell. We must fight; Yet had I rather take it on mine hand Than dare the general field. Queen. No, for God's love. Bothwell. God hath not so much love of us to serve; Nor would I wager on his head to-day That he shall fight upon our side. Look there; They are at point to cross; even now you see The first glint on them stirring of the sun. As they set forth to make by the eastern bank Along the meadows edgeways towards Dalkeith Before they turn in wheel and take the hills; I see their bent of battle; yet we keep The slopes and crest here with our covering lines If they stand fast. Queen. What, have you fear of that? Bothwell. I cannot tell; the day grows fiery hot: I would we might close in at once and strike Before the noon burn; all the pause we make Who stand here idle watchers till they join Takes off some heart from us for weariness And gives us doubt; I would the field were set. Queen. Why should not we that wait for them and chafe Break rather on them coming, and brush off Their gathering muster from the hillskirts there With one sheer stroke of battle as from heaven Right on them hurling down with all our host Out of these heights ere they made head below? Bothwell. No, my sweet captain; we must hold this fast, This height of vantage, and keep close our ranks As I have ranged in order: see again, How they sweep round and settle fast in file There on the ridge of Cowsland, with their backs Turned on the sun that climbs toward noon too fast, And in their front that hollow gap of hill Three crossbow-shots across; so far apart We look upon each other for a breath And hold our hands from battle; but you see How soon both sides must lash together: yea, I would we might not hold off yet an hour But close at once and end. Queen. That burgh below, Is it not Preston Pans? These hills are set As stages for the show of such high game As is played out for God's content on earth Between men's kings and kingdoms; yet I think He that beholds hath no such joy o'the game As he that plays, nor can the joy be known Save of man only, that man has to play When the die's throw rings death for him or life. How clear the wind strikes from the mounting sun— I am glad at heart the day we have of fight Should look thus lively on both sides that meet Beneath so large an open eye of heaven. The wind and sun are in my blood; I feel Their fire and motion in me like a breath That makes the heart leap. Dear, I too have read The tale of Rome whence lightly you chose out A likeness for us; but the parts we bear, We are to play them with a difference, take A fairer end upon us though we fall Than they that in their hazard were most like To this our imminent fortune: had I been She for whose lips love let the round world fall And all man's empire founder, on that day When earth's whole strengths met on the warring sea And side with side clashed of the kingdomed world, I had not given my galleys wings for fear To bear me out of the eye of battle, nor Put space of flight between me and my love, More than I think on this wave's edge that foams To leave our chance unshipwrecked, or forsake My more imperial Antony. Bothwell. Would that now We stood less near their hazard; on our part I fear to see the lines already melt If we hold longer off, and this firm front Unfix itself and with no stroke dissolve As snows in summer: half my folk by this For thirst are fallen upon the wine-casks there We brought from Seyton; and for those that stand, We have not half their hearts upon our side Whose hands are armed to uphold it. I must fight With whom they choose, and take upon my hand The day with all its issue: if our cause Be set upon the general cast of fight, It is but lost. Let messengers be sent To know of the enemy if his challenge hold Which I stand armed to answer; but no Scot Shall bear the message and betray our need: Two Frenchmen of your guard shall cross, and bring Their fighter's name back that my sword must know And we twain meet and end it in fair field Between these ranks; and for my single part, I am glad the chance should hang but on my hand And my sole stroke determine the dim war That flags yet in the dark and doubt of fate Till mine arm fix it fast, and in God's sight Confirm and close the chapter of it. Come, Choose you your envoys. Queen. Nay, choose you the man That you will fight with; let him be not one Who had no part with us in Darnley's blood, So God shall strike not on his unjust side Who fights against you. Bothwell. 'Faith, if God were judge, He should not do us right to approve their cause Who helped us to that slaying, and in its name Take on them now to accuse us, and appeal As guiltless to him against their proper deed And this right hand that wrought but with their will; Wherefore so far forth as it hangs on God From such a champion I should bear the bell, If he be righteous; which to assure you of, That even for God's sake you may feel no fear, Let Morton meet me. Queen. O, that two-tongued knave! The worst of all my traitors, whom I spared And should have slain when you had brought him home To help despatch his friend that had been! nay, Him shall you meet not: he shall die no death So brave as by your sword; the axe thinks long To clasp his cursed neck; your hand, dear lord, Shall not redeem it. Bothwell. Come, content you, sweet; Him I must meet, or other; and myself Care not if one that struck with us it be Or one that struck not; only for your ease, To make you trustful for God's judgment's sake And confident of justice, I thought well To choose a man of counsel with us then And on this challenge fight with him, that God Might witness with us of his treacherous cause If I should win the field; but by this hand, I put more trust in it and in my sword Than in God's hand or judgment. Have no fear; What is our cause you know, and in what right We stand here armed; vex not your constant heart To seek for help or warrant more than this, Which if it cannot stand us yet in stead It shall avail not to devise fresh means To underprop with prayer and trust in God And stay our souls with footless faith or hope That other might will aid our right than ours. Here shall we try it: and you, sustain your spirit Still at its height and poise of fortitude Firmly to front this infirm face of things That changes on us gazing, and each hour Shifts as the wind that shapes it; fear nor hope, Bethink yourself, shall make or unmake fate, Nor faith unbuild or build it, but that end Will be at last that will be. So, keep heart; Choose you two messengers for trust and speed, While I go form again these lines of ours That break and loosen in the enemy's sight, If time shall let reshape their ranks, and mend The breach of their defection; in short space Shall we have answer back whom I must meet, And then my sword shall take this day's chance up And ease us of its trouble. Nay, make haste; Too long I stand yet here; send off at once Our message, and bid speed their word again Before our battle melt out of our hands And we be ta'en with no man at our back. Scene II. —The Camp of the Lords. Morton, Lindsay, Du Croc, Kirkaldy of Grange, and others. Morton. Will she not let him fight? Kirkaldy. With no mean man, Or lesser than himself; he shall not mate With me nor Tullibardine; we must find One equal to make proffer of his hand, And by these messengers again returned That brought her first word and took back our own Himself now bids you forth by name to take This justice on your sword. Morton. And by my hand, I am as glad as of his present death That I should be the man of all chosen out To lay his death upon him. Let him know I am armed by this for answer. Lindsay. Nay, my lord; Who fights with Bothwell on this general plea For all the land's sake, should not only bear The right upon his sword of this large cause, But stand in the eye of all the land so far From all men's charge or any man's conceit That might repute him touched or mixed at all With Bothwell's works, or once but on his part Suspected in time past or glanced upon Of enemies' eyes as parcel of his act, That no sharp tongue on earth might find the mean To tax his victory with unrighteousness If he should conquer,—as were yours the sword I doubt not it should surely—nor dispute The justice and pure truth that on our side Took up this challenge. You, they know, were one Of that dead man once wronged, and sworn, they say, To turn his treacheries on his head alive And with his own lie pierce him as a sword; He never did me wrong, nor gave men cause To deem his death a thing that I should seek As just and natural part of my desire; So shall none hold it questionable or strange If I should stand against his slayer in arms As to do battle on the dead man's part That was toward me no traitor. Morton. Well, my lord, Take you then this upon you; to your hand I shall not grudge to yield that honour up Which none more noble in the world might wield Nor heart more true deserve; in sign whereof Here from mine own side I ungird the sword Which was my grandsire's, whose two-handed stroke Did such-like service as shall you to-day To Scotland, in his hand that belled the cat, When other slaves that clung about the throne Made the land foul as this doth; to which end I gird you with it, that its edge again May lop as high a dangerous head away And shear a weed as poisonous. This it was That drove to death even with its lift and flash The crew of Cochrane, as in scorn to smite Their necks that craved the halter, and were bowed Before the light and wind but of its stroke Down to the dust and death; and this again Struck with one blow to hell by Fala brook Spens of Kilspindie, who being overblown With favour and light love of the fourth James Gave with his life all these to Douglas up At the first change of sword-play; from such hand By heritage I have it, as from mine You now, my lord, by gift; and I well think That in those great dead hands of Bell-the-Cat It did no worthier work than ere we sleep This land in your shall see it. Lindsay. Sir, with glad heart I take the burden to me thankfully That this great gift lays on; as with my hands I strip this armour off and take from yours To gird my body left else weaponless This the most prosperous and most noble steel That ever did truth right, so from my soul God witness me that I put off all thought Save of his justice to be served and shown, And keep no memory more to enforce my hand That he for whose dead sake I am girt to fight With one that slew him was of my kindred blood, Nor this mine own foe that I seek to slay, But only that I stand here single-souled For this land's sake and all its noble brood, To do their judgment on his murderous head Who is their general traitor; and I pray Here on my knees before these warlike lines (Kneeling) That God on whom I call will equally This day preserve and punish in men's sight The just and unjust that he looks upon, With blameless hand dividing their just doom To one and other; yea, as thou art Lord, With eye to read between our hearts, and hand To part between us punishment and grace, Hear, God, and judge: and as thy sentence is So shall man's tongue speak ever of this day And of his cause that conquers. Morton. Laird of Grange, While these that twice brought message from the queen Bear now this last news back of what they hear, Lest when the traitor knows whom he shall meet His foul heart fail him and his false foot flee By what way forth is left him toward Dunbar, Take you two hundred horse, and with good speed Cross to the right beyond this hollow ground And cut him off; so though he fain would fly And she stand fast or follow, yet we hold As in one toil the lioness and the wolf That clomb by night into the lion's bed, Who stand now staked about with nets and ringed With pikes and hounds of hunters, glare at bay With eyes and teeth that shine against us yet, But the fierce feet are trammelled in our toils Nor shall the tongues lap life again of man. Du Croc. Ay, lion-like, my lord, she bears herself, As who should shake all spears or shafts away Like leaves that fell upon her, and all fears As grains of dust brushed off; but he too makes Such gallant show at need of such good heart As in this utter peril where he stands Might win for one that had no unjust cause Pity and praise of enemies, and for him At least such mingled and discoloured fame As falls not on a coward; nor can men Report him in his end and sore extreme But as a soldier tried of hand and brain, Skilful and swift, with heart to match his eye And wit to serve them; could these yet avail To ransom him by spirit of soldiership And craft with courage tempered as with fire To wield with fiery cunning the wide war, He should not fall but mightily, nor cease But with a strife as earthquake. Morton. Well, my lord, With no such strife we think to win him.—Go, And if they send again to treat with us Speak you with her and bring us once more word. Scene III. —The Queen's Camp. The Queen and Bothwell. Queen. Are we quite lost? Bothwell. Ay, if I fight not: but I will not die and fight not. Queen. What, no help? Is there not left a score of manlike men To stand and strike round us that in their ring May fight enclosed and fall where none shall fly? Are all our strengths slid from us? not one troop That has not piecemeal dropped with shame away? Not some twelve friends to back us yet and die As never men died nobler? Bothwell. No, not three: My levies there of Lothian and the Merse Are slipped away like water; of your men Not yet four hundred lie along the heights, Nor half will stay of these a half-hour hence. Look too where yonder rides about the hill The Laird of Grange between us and Dunbar As to make onset with two hundred horse Thence where the way is smooth, while those in front Charge up the hill right on our unfenced camp And their trap's teeth shut on us. This remains Of all our chance, this one way to make end, That while they yet refuse me not a man To bear the day's weight on his sword and mine I go to meet whom they soever choose With no more question made; and this I will, If yet they grant me but their meanest man For opposite as equal. Queen. Have they hearts, That have you for their fiery star of fight To see and not to follow? That I could But give mine own among all these away And with the parcels of it portioned out Divide myself into a hundred hearts Of manlier-spirited blood, to raise us up For these a tribe of soldiers! Speak to them, And they will hear and hunger to go on Full of your words to death; yea, all as I Will thirst to die around you. Omy God! What is their blood that it can kindle not To be so called of such a chief to die, To hear his words and leap not? Hast thou made Such stuff of man's flesh as we take for man, And mixed not soul enough to serve the hound Who gives for love his life up? These go back, These that might die, they start aside from death, They have no joy to close with it, but fear, These that I deemed, come what might worst on us, Should fall with face and heart one fire of joy To ride on death and grapple him and die. Have I not heard of men once in the world? I see none only but mine only love, Who finds not one to follow. You shall fight, And if we thrive not shame them with your end As I with mine ensuing. That I might stand Your second, and my sword be page to yours, As on your death my death should wait at need And halt not after! No, you shall not die. O miserable white hanging hands, that rest Baffled and bloodless! let your kingdom go, Let all things pass together; what of price Should ye keep back that could not fight for him Who falls for lack of seconds? Nay, the fault Comes all of me that fail him, I it is Bring down that high head to the earth with mine, That helmless head, for my sake; O, for love's, Kiss me, and kill me! be not wroth, but strike, For if I live I shall but deal more death And where I would not shall the more destroy, Living and loving; yea, whom I would save, Him shall I slay the surelier; save then me, Lest I do this and dying abhor myself, Save me and slay; let not my love again Kill more than me, that would have shed my blood To spare the blood I shed; make me now sure; Let me cease here. Bothwell. Peace, and give heed; you see Whither the day has brought us, and what hope Holds anywhere of rescue; this one lot Lies in my hand by fortune to be drawn, That yet by God's and by our enemies' grace I may fight singly though my whole world fail And end no less than soldier. Now, my queen, As you are highest of women's hearts that live And nobler than your station stands your soul— As you had never fear, and in this past As ever you have loved me—by such sign And in such name I charge you, put me not In this great need to shame; let me go forth As should yourself being king, had you the cause That our linked loves put on me; by that heart That is so fain within you to be man's, Make me not meaner than the man I am Nor worthless of the name; think with what soul Would you stand up to battle in my stead, And wrong me not to pluck that prize away Which were you I you would not yield to me Nor I would ask of you; desire not this, To have me for your sake so vile a thing, When I should rise up worthiest, that no man Could bear such name and live; bid me not be, Because you love me that are first on earth And crowned of queens most royal, such a slave As might not seek and be not spit upon The foulest favour that is given for gold From lips more vile than all things else but I Who durst not fight for you; make me not this; Let me die rather such a man as might, Having your love, had fortune loved him too, Have lived beside you kinglike, and not left Less memory than a king's. Queen. O, you shall go: Look how I hold you not; yes, you shall fight, And I sit strengthless here.—You shall not yet; If I did know that God were with my heart, Then should you go indeed; could I sit sure My prayer had power upon him, and my cause Had made him mine to fight for me, and take My charge and this field's issue in his hand, I would not doubt to send you. Nay, myself Will speak to those my soldiers; they will fight; They shall not choose for shame who hear me speak But fear to fight not. O, for all this yet, If they were men about me, they would sweep Those traitors from the hill-side as a wind And make me way to live. What, if I speak, If I kneel to them, each man by his name, Bid him fight for me though I be not king, His king to lead him—as, had I been born My father's son, they should have fought, and found A king to fight for and a sword to lead Worth many a good sword's following—nay, but these That will not fight for you whose sword they see Worth all their swords to follow, for no king's Would they take heart to strike. Love, you shall go; Send out a flag to bid one come and say Who dares of all fight with you. Why, methought This march-folk loved you and your sword's bright name That burned along their borders; is there left No such fierce love of theirs and faith at need To do us soldier's service? Bothwell. Look, and see; Their ranks unknit themselves and slide more fast From the bare slopes away whereon they stand Than the last leaves or the last snows that fade From off the fields or branches: and this thaw Speaks not our spring, but winter. Let them pass; If I may stand but in mine enemy's face, One foot of ours shall slip not, and one hand Be reddened on our side. Iwill go send Word with your flag of truce by Ormiston, To bid their spokesman to us. [Exit. Queen. What am I worth, That can nor fight nor pray? my heart is shut As a sealed spring of fire, and in mine ears This air that holds no thunder but fair day Sounds louder than a stricken brazen bell That rings in a great wind, or the blown sea That roars by night for shipwreck. Re-enter Bothwell with Kirkaldy. Bothwell. Here is he That bring our lords' will with him, and shall show But in your private ear; I while you please Will wait apart upon you. [Retires. Queen. Is it you, Is it my friend of France, my knight and friend, Comes on such errand in mine extreme need To me that honoured him? Sir, time has been That had one asked me what man most on earth I would for trust have sought the service of In such sore straits as this, I had found no name But yours to leap the first upon my lips, On whom I have seen my father the French king Point with his hand, saying, Yonder goes there one Of the most valiant men in all our age, And ever would he choose you on his side In all his pastimes for your manhood's sake And might in jousts of men and gallant games, And when they shot for mastery at the butts Would make you shoot two arrows still for one, And took delight beyond all shots of theirs To see how far forth would your great shaft fly, Sped for his pleasure; and my heart grew great For my land's sake whereof your strength was made, That bore such men for honour; and the best Who served my father Henry in his wars Looked reverently upon you horsed at head Of your brave hundred men that rode with you, And never the great constable of France Would speak to you uncovered as to one Less than his own place worthy; and your hand Here on these marches hath not lost its praise For many as fair a stroke as overthrew Between our ranks and the English in mid field Lord Rivers' brother, fighting for this land That with a tongue as true and serviceable You strove in speech to save the freedom of, That by no policy it should be subdued To a French province; so for faith and love, For valour, wisdom, and for gentleness, I wist no Scot had worthier name alive: Shall I say now I have no deadlier foe? [Kirkaldy kneels. I do not bid you kneel; speak, and stand up; I have no help or comfort of men's knees, Nor pleasure of false worship; well I know, For all knees bowed, how hearts and hands are bent Of mine own men against me. Speak, I pray; I am as their servant bound who speak in you And open-eared to hear them. Kirkaldy. From the lords, Madam, no word I have to bring but one, That from this field they will not part alive Without the man in bonds they came to seek; Him will they take, or die: but on your part They have no thought that is not set to serve And do you honour, would but you forsake The murderer of your husband, who to you Can be no husband, being but lately wed To the earl of Huntley's sister and your friend By your own mean and favour. Queen (to Bothwell). Hold, my lord; Let not your man give fire.—Sir, guard yourself; See you not where one stands to shoot at you?— You will not do me this dishonour, seeing I have given my faith he should come safely through And go back safe? Bothwell. Why, let him then, and say That I will yet maintain my proffered cause To fight with any that shall challenge me Of the king's murder. Kirkaldy. Sir, the first was I To let you wit myself would fight with you Upon that quarrel; and the first refused, As being nor earl nor lord nor mate of yours, But a poor baron only; the like word You sent to Tullibardine; in whose place Stands now my lord of Lindsay, if your heart Yet fail you not to meet him, as it seems Now to grow cold in shadow of his sword That hangs against you in the air advanced, Darkening your sight and spirit. Bothwell (to the Queen). Shall this be said, This shame go forth for ever through the world Of one that held you by the wedded hand And loosed it even for fear? Now, let me go: There is no way now but the best, and this You shall no more forbid me: one last time I do implore you make not of your love The branding-iron that should sign me slave In sight of all men always, and on you Stamp the vile name of wife to no true man But harlot of a coward: who shall spare To throw that name and shame on such a love As came to such an end as ours shall come If here its sun set bloodless, but more red With shame than blood could brand it? Queen. I have thought And set my heart against all chance to come Of blame or blood that ever shall mark me; Alone I take it on mine only hand, And will not yield this one thing up to yours, Who have yielded all things else, and this I would, But that I may not with my soul alive. Sir, if my lords within whose hand I am Shall stand content to let my husband go, Into their ward will I give up myself On what good terms shall please them to call good, So he may pass forth freely with such friends Of these that have not hands enough to fight As shall cleave to him; I pray you make good speed, And let this day have end. Kirkaldy. Madam, I go. [Exit. Queen. Do not speak yet: a word should burst my heart; It is a hollow crystal full of tears That even a breath might break, and they be spilt And life run out with them; no diamond now, But weaker than of wax. Life of that heart, There is but one thing hath no remedy, Death; all ills else have end or hope of end And time to work their worst before time change; This death has none; there is all hope shut fast, All chance bound up for ever: change nor time Can help nor comfort this. You shall not die; I can hold fast no sense of thought but this, You shall not. Bothwell. Well, being sundered, we may live, And living meet; and here to hold the field Were but a deadly victory, and my hand The mockery of a conqueror's; we should pass No less their prisoners from the field thus won Than from these lists defeated. You do well; They dare not urge or strain the power they have To bring me prisoner where my witness borne Might show them parcel of the deed and guilt For which they rise up to lay hold on me As upright men of doom, and with pure hands To hale me to their judgment. I will go, Till good time bring me back; and you that stay, Keep faith with me. Queen. O, how does one break faith? What are they that are faithless? by my love, I cannot tell or think how I should lie, Should live and lie to you that are my faith, My soul, my spirit, my very and only God, My truth and trust that makes me true of heart, My life that feeds and light that lightens me, My breath and blood of living. Doth God think How I shall be without you? what strange breath Shall my days draw, what strange blood feed my life, When this life that is love is gone from them And this light lost? Where shall my true life go, And by what far ways follow to find love, Fly where love will? Where will you turn from me? Bothwell. Hence will I to Dunbar, and thence again There is no way but northward and to ship From the north islands; thence betimes abroad By land or sea to lurk and find my life Till the wheel turn. Queen. Ah God, that we were set Far out at sea alone by storm and night To drive together on one end, and know If life or death would give us good or ill And night or day receive, and heaven or earth Forget us or remember!—He comes back; Here is the end. Bothwell. But till time change his tune; No more nor further. We shall find our day. Queen. Have we not found? I know not what we shall, But what hath been and is, and whence they are, God knows if now I know not. He is here. Re-enter Kirkaldy. Kirkaldy. Madam, the lords return by me this word, With them must you go back to Edinburgh And there be well entreated as of friends; And for the duke, they are with one mind content He should part hence for safe and present flight; But here may tarry not or pass not free. This is the last word from them by my mouth. Queen. Ay is it, sir; the last word I shall hear— Last in mine ear for ever: no command Nor threat of man shall I give ear to more, That have heard this.—Will you not go, my lord? It is not I would hold you. Bothwell. Then, farewell, And keep your word to me. What, no breath more? Keep then this kiss too with the word you gave, And with them both my heart and its good hope To find time yet for you and me. Farewell. [Exit. Queen. O God! God! God! Cover my face for me: I cannot heave my hand up to my head; Mine arms are broken. Is he got to horse? I do not think one can die more than this. I did not say farewell. Kirkaldy. My lord is gone. Queen. Whom spake I to? I have no woman here. All these men's eyes have seen my naked face Wrung without tears for anguish, and no hand Hide my blind eyes if haply they might weep Great drops of blood and fiery.—Laird of Grange, I yield myself upon such terms to you As in these lords' name you rehearsed to me; Have here my hand for sign. Kirkaldy. Upon this hand I lay the loyal witness of my lips For duteous heart and service, and crave leave That I may lead your highness through these ranks Where at the hill's foot we may find your friends Who shall come forth to meet you as their queen With all fair reverence. Queen. Lead me to my lords; For one so poor a servant as I am Here are too many masters. I could pray, But that they lack my service and should chafe If I dwelt long upon my prayer and let My duty sleep or slacken toward them; else I could pray God to shut up from these lands His hand and eye of favour, that no dew Might breed herefrom and no bloom break again Nor grass be glad for ever; rain nor sun Comfort their cankered face and hardening heart, Nor hand that tilled or foot that trod of man Pass and not curse them. Let me look but once Upon this hill whereon till this ninth hour Mine enemies' hands have crucified my heart. The sun burns yet and the stream runs; nor eye Nor ear have these nor pity. Come, I talk, Who had no mind; God will not heed me; come. [Exeunt. Scene IV. The Camp of the Lords. Morton, Hume, Lindsay, &amp;c. Morton. What, is the Frenchman gone? Lindsay. With heavy cheer, By this to set sad foot in Edinburgh. Morton. There should we be by nightfall; and you see How the day reddens downward, and this hill Hath all its west side fiery; he hath done The queen and us small service, to put off The hour of yielding. Look, the last spears left Begin to move in sunder; there he flies, The traitor, with his heartless handful backed That yet for fear cling to him: and on this side Grange leads her down the hill between our horse, Who comes not like one captive. Enter the Queen and Kirkaldy. Queen. Tell me, sirs, Are they my doomsmen whom I come to find And those your headsmen who stand sworded there And visored soldier-like, that cry on me To burn and slay me? let me have quick doom And be beyond their crying. Morton. Madam, I think You cannot fear of us a deadly doom Nor shall you find. Silence those throats, I say. Queen. I have not said I feared; nor shall there come For you that lying breath upon my lips. What will ye do with what of me ye have If not what these tongues cry for? Morton. Some man ride— You, Laird of Grange, with two or three at back, And with the flatlong stroke of your good swords Smite their mouths dumb. Madam, take you no heed; They shall not hurt you. Queen. Sir, no heed have I; I think these common haters shall not hurt Indeed, nor smite me but with tongues; 'tis you, My good lords only, from whose noble hands I look to take my death, who would not lose Nor lack this royal office. For my sake Do them no hurt, I pray, who are but your mouths As you their hands; I see no choice of you, Or them the lesser traitors. Hume. I will go: Ride you that way, sir, by their ranks who shout, As I this side; for every way men hear How the field rings that all the hills roar back With noise of names and cries to burn the whore And murderess of her husband: spare no strokes To shame or smite them silent. Queen. You, my friends, Good servants that have care of my good name, And loyal lovers—of your love and grace, May it please you show me whither I must go To find what face of death? or if yet none, And yet ye have not the hardy hearts to slay, To uncrown and slay me, I require you then Deliver me into my kinsmen's hands Of the house of Hamilton, in whose good ward I am content to abide men's evil will With honourable surety; which refused, Of life nor honour shall I hold me sure For all your vows and voices, but esteem My life to be as all your honours, dead. Morton. Madam, with mocks you cannot make us mad, To bring you to their trustless hands whose ward Should be to you but dangerous, and to us And all this kingdom's hope in heritage And all men's good most mortal. You must go With us to Edinburgh, and, being made safe, Abide the judgment there that shall not fall By fierce election of men's clamorous mouths Whose rage would damn you to the fire-clad death, But by their sentence who shall do no wrong, If justice may with honour make them sure And faith defend from error. Queen. Ay, my lord? I shall be doomed then ere I die, and stand Before their face for judgment who should kneel To take my sentence as a scourge, and bear What brand my tongue set on them? Nay, ye are mad; Kings have been slain with violence and red craft Or fallen by secret or by popular hands, But what man heard yet ever of a king Set to the bar of his own men to plead For life with rebels' reasons, and wage words With whoso dare of all these baser born Rise up to judge him? Surely I shall die, Be rent perchance in pieces of men's fangs, But of their mouths not sentenced: in fair field That only steel that bids a king's neck stoop Is the good sword that in a warlike hand Makes his head bow and cuts not off his crown But with the stroke of battle; who hath seen By doom of man a king's head kingdomless Bow down to the axe and block? so base an edge Can bite not on such necks. Let me bleed here, By their swift hands who ravin for my blood, Or be assured how if ye let me live I live to see you die for me as dogs: Ye shall be hanged on crosses, nailed on rows, For birds to rend alive; ye shall have doom, A dog's doom and a traitor's, and the cord Strangle the sentence in your labouring lips And break the plea that heaves your throat and leaves Your tongue thrust forth to blacken; ye shall wage Words and try causes with the worms and flies Till they leave bare your bones to sun and wind As shame shall leave your titles. Was it you [To Lindsay. That were to fight before me with my lord? Give me your hand, sir; by this hand of yours I swear for this thing yet to have your head, And so thereof assure you. Morton. Bid the camp Strike and set forth behind us. Sirs, to horse; And, madam, be not yet so great of speech As utterly to outwear your spirit of strength With pain and passion that can bear no fruit But wind and wrath and barren bitterness. Vex not yourself more than your foes would vex, Of whom we would be none that ride with you From them to guard you that would lay red hands On you yet faint and weak from this fierce day. Queen. My body and head wax faint, but not my heart; I have yet there fire enough for all of you, To burn your strengths up that my feebler limbs Can make my heart not yield to nor bow down, Nor fear put out its fires. Come, worthy lords, And lead me to my loving town again That bears your heads not yet above its gates Where I shall see them festering if I live. [Exeunt. Scene V. Edinburgh, A Room in the Provost's House. Enter Maitland and Provost. Maitland. Are the gates fast? Provost. Ay; but the street yet seethes With ebb and flow of fighting faces thronged And crush of onset following on her heel Where she came in and whence at her own call You drove them off her; and above the ranks Flaps the flag borne before her as she came Wrought with the dead king's likeness; and their cry Is yet to burn or drown her. It were but A manlike mercy now for men to show That she should have some woman's hand of hers To tend her fainting who should be nigh dead With fear and lack of food and weariness. Maitland. Nay, if she die not till she die for fear, She must outlive man's memory; twice or thrice As she rode hither with that sable flag Blown overhead whereon the dead man lay Painted, and by him beneath a garden tree His young child kneeling, with soft hands held up And the word underwritten of his prayer Judge and avenge my cause, O Lord—she seemed At point to swoon, being sick with two days' fast, And with faint fingers clung upon the rein And gaped as one athirst with foodless lips And fair head fainting; but for very scorn Was straightway quickened and uplift of heart, And smote us with her eyes again, and spoke No weaker word but of her constant mind To hang and crucify, when time should be, These now her lords and keepers; so at last Beneath these walls she came in with the night, So pressed about with foes that man by man We could but bring her at a foot's pace through Past Kirk of Field between the roaring streets, Faint with no fear, but hunger and great rage, With all men's wrath as thunder at her heel, And all her fair face foul with dust and tears, But as one fire of eye and cheek that shone With heat of fiery heart and unslaked will That took no soil of fear. Provost. What shall be done When sentence shall pass on her? Maitland. By my will She shall not die nor lose her royal name, Wherein the council only shall bear rule And take to its own hand the care to wreak On her false lord now fled our general wrong, Who being but overtaken of its sword Shall be divorced at once from her and life. Provost. But this shall not content the common will, Nor theirs who bind and loose it with their tongues And cry now for her blood; the town is loud With women's voices keener than of men To call for judgment on her and swift death Sharp as their anger. Maitland. Ay, the time is mad With noise of preachers and the feminine spleen That of mere rage and blind mobility Barks in brute heat for blood; but on these tongues The state yet hangs not, nor the general weal Is swayed but by the violent breath of these. Here sits she safe. Provost. I would I knew it; her mood Is as a wind that blows upon a fire, And drives her to and fro: she will not eat, But rages here and there and cries again On us for traitors, on her friends for help, On God for comfort of her cause and crown That of his foes and hers is violated, And will not stint her clamours nor take rest For prayer nor bidding. Maitland. I will speak with her Ere I go hence; though she were mild of mood, The task were hard with Knox for opposite To bend the council to such policy As might assure her but of life, which thus She whets the weapon in his tongue to take. [Exeunt. Scene VI. —Another Room in the same. The Queen and an Attendant. Queen. Wilt thou be true? but if thou have not heart, Yet do not, being too young to sell man's blood, Betray my letter to mine enemies' hands Where it should be a sword to smite me with; If thou lack heart, I say, being but a boy, Swear not and break thine oath; but if thou have, Thou shalt not ask for this mine errand done The thing I will not give thee. At Dunbar Bring but this letter to my husband's hand; Spare for no speed; if it were possible I would it might be with him ere day dawn On me condemned of men. I have no hope, Thou seest, but in thee only; thou art young And mean of place, but be thou good to me And thou shalt sit above thy masters born And nobles grey in honour. Wilt thou go? Have here mine only jewel, and my faith That I plight to thee, when my hand may choose, To give thee better gifts. Haste, and so thrive As I by thee shall. [Exit Attendant. Though thou play me false, Thou dost no more than God has done with me And all men else before thee: yet I could not But write this worthless one word of my love Though I should die for writing it in vain, And he should never read it. Enter Maitland. Come you not To tell me of my commons and your friends That by their will despite you I must die? It were no stranger now than all things are That fall as on me dreaming. Maitland. Madam, no; I come to plead with you for your own life, Which wrath and violent mood would cast away. Queen. What is my life to any man or me As ye have made it? If ye seek not that, Why have ye torn me from my husband's hand, With whom ye know that I would live and die With all content that may be in the world? Maitland. For your own honour have we sundered you; You know not him, who late writ word—myself Can show this letter—to the Lady Jane, She was his wife and you his concubine, No more but sport and scandal in his sheets, And loved for use but as a paramour And for his ends to rise and by your lips Be kissed into a kingdom; and each week Since they were first but as in show divorced And but of craft divided, on some days Have they held secret commerce to your shame As wedded man and wife. Queen. There is one thing That I would ask of even such friends as you— To turn me with my lord adrift at sea And make us quit of all men. Maitland. For yourself, You drive on no less danger here of wreck, Seeing for your life if England take no care France will nor strike nor speak; and had you not In your own kindly kingdom yet some friends Whose hearts are better toward you, these wot well You had none left you helpful in the world. Yet what we may will I and all these do To serve you in this strait; so for this night Let not your peril, which can breed not fear, For that breed anger in you; and farewell. [Exit. Queen. None but such friends? O yet my living lord, O still my comfort, hadst thou none but me As I save thee have no man, we would go Hand fast in hand to dreadless death, and see With such clear eyes as once our marriage-bed Fire, or the sword's light lifted to make end Of that one life on both our lips that laughed To think he could not sunder them who smote, Nor change our hearts who chilled them; we would kiss, Laugh, and lie down, and sleep; but here in bonds I will not tamely like a dumb thing die That gives its blood and speaks not. If I find No faith in all this people, yet my curse Shall through this casement cry in all their ears That are made hard against me.—Ho there, you, All that pass by, your queen am I that call, Have I no friend of all you to turn back The swords that point on this bare breast, the hands That grasp and hale me by the hair to death, By this discrowned rent hair that wore too soon The kingdom's weight of all this land in gold? Have I no friend? no friend? Voice without. Ay, here was one; Know you yet him? Raise up the banner there, That she may look upon her lord, and take Comfort. A Woman. What, was not this that kneels the child Which hung once at that harlot's breast now bare And should have drunk death from its deadly milk? Hide it for shame; bind up the wanton hair, Cover the poisonous bosom; here is none To kiss the print of that adulterer's head Which last lay on it. Another voice. Whither is he flown, Whose amorous lips were bloody, and left red The shameless cheek they fed on as with shame? Where is your swordsman at your back to guard And make your sin strut kinglike? where his hand That made this dead man's child kneel fatherless And plead with God against you for his blood? Where is your king-killer? Queen. The day shall be That I will make this town a fire, and slake The flame with blood of all you: there shall stand No mark of man, no stone of these its walls, To witness what my wrath made ruin of That turned it first to smoke, and then put out With all your blood its ashes. Enter Provost. Hear you, sir, How we are handled of our townsfolk there, Being yet in ward of you? but by my head, If now by force it fall not, you as these Shall buy this of me bloodily, and first Shall bleed of all whose lives will pay not me. Provost. Madam, as you desire to see that day, Contain yourself; this flame whereon you blow Will fasten else untimely on your hand And leave it harmless toward us. I beseech you, Though but for hate of us and hope to hurt, Eat, and take rest. Queen. I will not; what are ye That I should care for hate of you to live Who care not for the love's sake of my life? If I shall die here in your hateful hands, In God's I put my cause, as into them I yield the spirit that dares all enemies yet By force to take it from me. Die or live I needs must at their bidding; but to sleep, Eat, drink, weep, laugh, speak or keep silence, these They shall not yet command me till I die. [Exeunt. Scene VII. —The High Street. A crowd of Citizens. First Citizen. Who says she shall not die? Second Citizen. Even he that stands First in this city, Morton; by his doom, Death shall not pass upon her. First Citizen. Will he say it? Yet is this man not all the tongue or hand That Scotland has to speak or smite with. Third Citizen. Nay, When he so spake against their honest voice Who called for judgment, one arose that said— I know not who, but one that spake for God— That he who came between God's sword and her Should as a stayer of justice by the sword Be stricken of God's justice. First Citizen. What said he? Third Citizen. No word, but frowned; and in his eye and cheek There sprang a fire and sank again, as 'twere For scorn that anger should have leave to speak Though silently; but Maitland writhed his lip And let his teeth grin doglike, and between There shot some snarling word that mocked at God And at the servants of his wrath, who wait To see his will done on her, and men's hands Made ministers to set it forth so broad That none might pass and read not. Second Citizen. Why, by this Part hangs of it already in men's sight; I have word here from Dunbar of one that was An officer of Bothwell's, and alive Laird of Blackadder, whom they seized at sea Flying from death to deathward, and brought back To be nigh rent in pieces of their hands Who haled him through the streets to hang, and left Not half a man unbroken or unbruised To feel the grip o'the gallows. First Citizen. They did well; Shall we do worse, that have within our hand The heart and head of all this evil, her By whom all guilt looks guiltless till she die A whore's death or a murderer's, burn or drown, And leave more free the common doom of man To pass on lesser sins? While she doth live, How should it speak for shame to bid men die For what sin done soever, who might say She lives and laughs yet in God's face and eye And finds on earth no judgment as do these Whose bloodiest hands are whiter than her soul? Let her die first. Third Citizen. Ay shall she, if God put Upon those lips that never lacked it yet His fire to burn men's hearts, and make that tongue His sword that hath been ever. Yesternight Came Knox to Edinburgh, and here should speak By this among us of the doom to fall On us or her, that if it bruise her not Must glance aside against us. Second Citizen. He is here. Draw nigh, but make no noise. Enter John Knox. First Citizen. Nay, all the press Heaves round about him silent. Others. Sirs, give place; Make way for Master Knox to stand and speak Here in your midst; here is it higher; give way. Make room to hear him. Peace there, and stand still. John Knox. What word is this that ye require of man? Ye that would hear me, what speech heard of mine Should lift your hearts up if they sit not high, If they lack life, should quicken? for this day Ye know not less than I know that the Lord Hath given his enemy to you for a prey, His judgment for a fire; what need have ye, Or he what need of other tongues to speak Than this which burns all ears that hear on earth The blast of this day's justice blown in heaven— As where is he that hears not? In your hand Lies now the doom of God to deal, and she Before your face to abide it, in whose mouth His name was as a hissing; and had I The tongues in mine of angels, and their might, What other word or mightier should I seek Than this to move you? or should ye wax cold What fuel should I find out to kindle you? If God ye hear not, how shall ye hear me? Or if your eyes be sealed to know not her, If she be fit to live or no, can I With words unseal them? None so young of you But hath long life enough to understand And reason to record what he hath seen Of hers and of God's dealings mutually Since she came in. Then was her spirit made soft, Her words as oil, and with her amorous face She caught men's eyes to turn them where she would, And with the strong sound of her name of queen Made their necks bend; that even of God's own men Those were that bade refuse her not her will, Deny not her, fair woman and great queen, Her natural freedom born, to give God praise What way she would, and pray what prayers; though these Be as they were, to God abominable And venomous to men's souls. So came there back The cursed thing cast forth of us, and so Out of her fair face and imperious eyes Lightened the light whereby men walk in hell. And I that sole stood out and bade not let The lightning of this curse come down on us And fly with feet as fire on all winds blown To burn men's eyes out that beheld God's face, That being long blind but now gat sight, and saw And praised him seeing—I that then spake and said, Ten thousand men here landed of our foes Were not so fearful to me on her side As one mass said in Scotland—that withstood The man to his face I loved, her father's son, Then mastered by the pity of her, and made Through that good mind not good—who then but I Was taxed of wrongful will, and for hard heart Miscalled of men? And now, sirs, if her prayer Were just and reasonable, and unjust I That bade shut ears against it—if the mass Hath brought forth innocent fruit, and in this land Wherein she came to stablish it again Hath stablished peace with honour—if in her It hath been found no seed of shame, and she That loved and served it seem now in men's sight No hateful thing nor fearful—if she stand Such a queen proven as should prove honourable The rule of women, and in her that thing Be shown forth good that was called evil of me, Blest and not curst—then have I sinned, and they That would have crossed me would have crossed not God: Whereof now judge ye. Hath she brought with her Peace, or a sword? and since her incoming Hath the land sat in quiet, and the men Seen rest but for one year? or came not in Behind her feet, right at her back, and shone Above her crowned head as a fierier crown, Death, and about her as a raiment wrapt Ruin? and where her foot was ever turned Or her right hand was pointed, hath there fallen No fire, no cry burst forth of war, no sound As of a blast blown of an host of men For summons of destruction? Hath God shown For sign she had found grace in his sight, and we For her sake favour, while she hath reigned on us, One hour of good, one week of rest, one day? Or hath he sent not for an opposite sign Dissensions, wars, rumours of wars, and change, Flight and return of men, terror with power, Triumph with trembling? Hath one foot stood fast, One head not bowed, one face not veiled itself, One hand not hidden? Was this once or twice That ye beheld, this brief while of her reign, Strong men one day make mouths at God, the next Lie where his foes lie fallen? or since she came Have ye seen raised up of them and cast down But one or two that served her? Which of these, Which of them all that looked on her and loved, And men spake well of them, and pride and hope Were as their servants—which of all them now Shall men speak well of? How fared he the first Hailed of his own friends and elect her lord, Who gave her kinsmen heart and godless hope By him to reign in her and wield this land, Yet once with me took counsel and sought grace, And suddenly God left him, and he stood Brain-smitten, with no bride-bed now nor throne To conquer, but go senseless to his grave, The broken-witted Hamilton—what end, Think ye, had this man, or what hope and hap The next whose name met on men's lips with hers And ballads mourned him in his love's sight slain, Gordon, that in the dawn of her dark day Rose northward as a young star fiery red, Flashed in her face, and fell, for her own breath Quenched him? What good thing gat they for her sake, These that desired her, yet were mighty lords, Great in account of great men? So they twain Perished; and on men meaner far than these When this queen looked, how fared they? folk that came With wiles and songs and sins from over sea, With harping hands and dancing feet, and made Music and change of praises in her ear— White rose out of the south, star out of France, Light of men's eyes and love! yea, verily, Red rose out of the pit, star out of hell, Fire of men's eyes and burning! for the first Was caught as in a chamber snare and fell Smiling, and died with Farewell, the most fair And the most cruel princess in the world— With suchlike psalms go suchlike souls to God Naked—and in his blood she washed her feet Who sat and saw men spill it; and this reward Had this man of his dancing. For the next, On him ye know what hand was last year laid, David, the close tongue of the Pope, the hand That held the key of subtle and secret craft As of his viol, and tuned all strings of state With cunning finger; not the foot o'the king Before God's ark when Michal mocked at him Danced higher than this man's heart for confidence To bring from Babylon that ark again Which he that touches, he shall surely die, But not the death of Uzzah; for thereon God's glory rests not, but the shadow of death, And dead men's bones within it: yet his trust Was to lift up again and to relume The tabernacle of Moloch, and the star Of Remphan, figures which our fathers made, That such as he might go before, and play On timbrels and on psalteries and on harps, On cornets and on cymbals; and the Lord Brake him; and she being wroth at God took thought How they that saw might call his place of death The breach of David, and her heart waxed hot Till she should make a breach upon his foes As God on him, and with a dire new name And a new memory quite put out that name And memory of his slaying; yea, all this land That hath seen evil of many men before And sins of many years, hath seen till now No sin as hers, nor on her forefathers Whose hands were red and their hearts hard hath seen The note of such an evil as in her heart Became a fire conceiving, and brought forth The deed that in her hand was as a sword New tempered in that fire; for no such deed Was this as all theirs who play false or slay, Take gifts for whoredom or lay snares to kill, But she gave gifts to hire her lover's knife That it might pierce her husband; even this land, This earth whereof our living limbs are made, This land renewed of God, this earth redeemed, With all souls born therein to worship him That call it mother, was the hire she gave To see the adulterer's hand when it should rise Against her lord to slay him; yea, all of you, And each part of this kingdom, and each man That but draws breath within her range of reign, Were parcel of this hire, as counted coins To make the sum up of her goodly gift. And he that of their hands was bought and sold, Her wedded husband, that had bowed his head Before her worshipped idol—think ye not That by her hand God gave him all his wage Who was a less thing in his eyes than she And viler than her service? for the fire Fell not from heaven that smote him, yet not less Was kindled of God's wrath than of man's hate And in a woman's craft his will put forth To make her sin his judgment; but of these, The slain and slayer, the spoiler and the spoiled, That each have lain down by her wedded side, Which will ye say hath slept within her bed A sleep more cursed, and from more evil dreams Found a worse waking? he that with a blast Which rent the loud night as a cry from hell Was blown forth darkling from her sheets, or he That shared and soiled them till this day whereon God casts him out upon the track of Cain To flee for ever with uncleansed red hands And seek and find not where in the waste world To hide the wicked writing on his brow Till God rain death upon him? for his foot, Be sure, shall find no rest, his eye no sleep, His head no covert and his heart no hope, His soul no harbour and his face no light, But as a hound the wolf that bleeds to death God's wrath shall hunt him through the dark, and fear Shall go before him as a cloud by day, By night a fire, but comfort not his head By day with shadow, nor with shine by night Guide lest his foot be dashed against a stone, But in fair heaven before the morning's face Make his air thick with thunder, and put out All lamplike eyes of stars that look on him Till he lie down blind in the dust and die. Or if God haply give his lightnings charge They hurt him not, and bid his wind pass by And the stroke spare him of the bolted cloud, Then seeing himself cast out of all that live But not of death accepted, everywhere An alien soul and shelterless from God, He shall go mad with hate of his own soul, Of God and man and life and death, and live A loathlier life and deadlier than the worm's That feeds on death, and when it rots from him Curse God and die. Such end have these that loved; And she that was beloved, what end shall she? What think ye yet would God have done with her, Who puts her in our hand to smite or spare That hath done all this wickedness? for these What were they but as shadows in the sun Cast by her passing, or as thoughts that fled Across her mind of evil, types and signs Whereby to spell the secret of her soul Writ by her hand in blood? What power had they, What sense, what spirit, that was not given of her, Or what significance or shape of life Their act or purpose, formless else and void, Save as her will and present force of her Gave breath to them and likeness? None of these Hath done or suffered evil save for her, Who was the spring of each man's deed or doom And root for each of death, and in his hand The sword to die by and the sword to slay. Shall this be left then naked in the world For him that will to stab our peace to death? What blood is this drips from the point, what sign, What scripture is enamelled on the blade? Lo, this fair steel forged only to divide This land from truth and cut her soul in twain, To cleave the cords in sunder that hold fast Our hope to heaven and tie our trust to God, Here by the hilt we hold it, and well know That if we break not, this now blunted edge Being newly ground and sharpened of men's hands That watch if ours will yet loose hold of it Shall pierce our own hearts through. Ay, be ye sure If we bid murder and adultery live, They live not stingless; not a Scot that breathes, No man of you nor woman, but hath part In each her several sin and punishment That ye take off from her. But what are these That with their oaths or arms would fence her round And hide her from God's lightnings? Know they not, —Or if they know not, will ye too be blind,— What end that Lord who hath bowed so many a head, So many and mighty, of those her former friends, Hath power to make of these men? Shall they stand, Because they have done God service while they would, And cease to serve him? or their good deeds past Who served not God as Job forsooth for nought Sustain their feet from falling? Strength nor craft, Nor praise nor fear nor faith nor love of men, Shall be for buckler to them, nor his name A helm of vantage for the Douglas' head If he make stiff against the yoke of God Too proud a neck, that for the curb cast off May feel the weight and edge that iron hath To check high minds and chasten; nor his wit Nor subtle tongue shall be for Lethington But as a pointless and unfeathered shaft Shot heavenward without hurt, that falls again In the archer's eye to pierce it; and his lips That were so large of mockery when God spake, By present organ of his works and wrath And tongueless sound of justice audible, Shall drink the poison of their words again And their own mocks consume them; and the mouth That spat on Christ, now pleading for his foes, Be stricken dumb as dust. Then shall one say, Seeing these men also smitten, as ye now Seeing them that bled before to do her good, God is not mocked; and ye shall surely know What men were these and what man he that spake The things I speak now prophesying, and said That if ye spare to shed her blood for shame, For fear or pity of her great name or face, God shall require of you the innocent blood Shed for her fair face' sake, and from your hands Wring the price forth of her bloodguiltiness. Nay, for ye know it, nor have I need again To bring it in your mind if God ere now Have borne me witness; in that dreary day When men's hearts failed them for pure grief and fear To see the tyranny that was, and rule Of this queen's mother, where was no light left But of the fires wherein his servants died, I bade those lords that clave in heart to God And were perplexed with trembling and with tears Lift up their hearts, and fear not; and they heard What some now hear no more, the word I spake Who have been with them, as their own souls know, In their most extreme danger; Cowper Moor, Saint Johnston, and the Crags of Edinburgh, Are recent in my heart; yea, let these know, That dark and dolorous night wherein all they With shame and fear were driven forth of this town Is yet within my mind; and God forbid That ever I forget it. What, I say, Was then my exhortation, and what word Of all God ever promised by my mouth Is fallen in vain, they live to testify Of whom not one that then was doomed to death Is perished in that danger; and their foes, How many of these hath God before their eyes Plague-stricken with destruction! lo the thanks They render him, now to betray his cause Put in their hands to stablish; even that God's That kept them all the darkness through to see Light, and the way that some now see no more, But are gone after light of the fen's fire And walk askant in slippery ways; but ye Know if God's hand have ever when I spake Writ liar upon me, or with adverse proof Turned my free speech to shame; for in my lips He put a word, and knowledge in my heart, When I was fast bound of his enemies' hands An oarsman on their galleys, and beheld From off the sea whereon I sat in chains The walls wherein I knew that I there bound Should one day witness of him; and this pledge Hath God redeemed not? Nay then, in God's name, If that false word fell unfulfilled of mine, Heed ye not now nor hear me when I say That for this woman's sake shall God cut off The hand that spares her as the hand that shields, And make their memory who take part with her As theirs who stood for Baal against the Lord With Ahab's daughter; for her reign and end Shall be like Athaliah's, as her birth Was from the womb of Jezebel, that slew The prophets, and made foul with blood and fire The same land's face that now her seed makes foul With whoredoms and with witchcrafts; yet they say Peace, where is no peace, while the adulterous blood Feeds yet with life and sin the murderous heart That hath brought forth a wonder to the world And to all time a terror; and this blood The hands are clean that shed, and they that spare In God's just sight spotted as foul as Cain's. If then this guilt shall cleave to you or no, And to your children's children, for her sake, Choose ye; for God needs no man that is loth To serve him, and no word but his own work To bind and loose their hearts who hear and see Such things as speak what I lack words to say. First Citizen. She shall not live. Second Citizen. If by their mouths to-day She be set free from death, then by our hands She dies to-morrow. Voices in the crowd. Nay, to fire with her! Fire for the murderess! cast her bones in the lake! Burn, burn and drown! She shall not live to-night. Scene VIII. —A Room in the Provost's House. The Queen, Athol, and Morton. Queen. I will not part from hence; here will I see What man dare do upon me. Athol. Hear you not How the cry thickens for your blood? this night Scarce has time left to save you. Queen. I will die. Morton. Madam, your will is no more now the sword That cuts all knots in sunder: you must live, And thank the force that would not give you leave To give your foes the blood they seek to spill. Here every hour's is as an arrow's flight Winged for your heart; if in these clamorous walls You see this darkness by the sun cast out, You will not see his light go down alive. Queen. What men are ye then, that have made my life Safe with your oaths, that walled it round with words, Fenced it with faith and fortressed it with air Made of your breaths and honours? When ye swore, I knew the lie's weight on your lips, and took My life into mine hand; I had no thought To live or ride among you but to death, And whither ye have led me to what end Nor I nor God knows better than I knew Then when ye swore me safe; for then as now I knew your faith was lighter than my life, And my life's weight a straw's weight in the wind Of your blown vows. Pledge me your faith to this, That I shall die to-night if I go forth And if I stay live safe, and I will go In trust to live, being here assured to die. Morton. We swore to save you as you swore again To cast the traitor from you, and divorce Your hand for ever from the blood on his; And with that hand you wrote to him last night Vows of your love and constant heart till death As his true wife to serve and cleave to him. The boy that should have borne your letter lacked Faith to be trusty to your faithless trust, And put it in our hand. Queen. Why, so I thought I knew there was no soul between these walls Of child or man that had more faith than ye Who stand its noblest; nor shall one soul breathe, If here ye put not out my present life, When I come back, that shall not burn on earth Ere hell take hold of it. Morton. It is well seen, Madam, that fear nor danger can pluck forth Your tongue that strikes men mad with love or scorn, Taunted or tempted; yet it shall not wrest Death from men's hands untimely; what was sworn, That you should live, shall stand; and that it may, To-night must you part hence; this lord and I Will bring you through to Holyrood afoot And be your warders from the multitude As you pass forth between us; thence to Leith, And there shall you take water and ere dawn Touch at Burntisland, whence some twenty miles Shall bear you to Lochleven and safe guard On the Fife border; he that has your charge Is one not trusted more than tried of us, Sir William Douglas, in whose mother's ward At Kinross there shall you abide what end God shall ordain of troubles: at this need No kindlier guard or trustier could secure The life we pluck out of the popular mouth That roars agape to rend it. You must go. Queen. Must I not too go barefoot? being your queen, Ye do me too much grace: I should be led In bonds between you, with my written sins Pinned to my forehead, and my naked shame Wrapt in a shameful sheet: so might I pass, If haply I might pass at all alive Forth of my people's justice, to salute With seemly show of penance her chaste eyes Whom ye have chosen for guard upon her queen And daughter of the king her paramour, Whose son being called my brother I must call, Haply, to win her favour and her son's And her good word with him as mediatress, My father's harlot mother. Verily, Ye are worthy guardians of fair fame, and friends Fit to have care of reputation, men That take good heed of honour; and the state That hath such counsellors to comfort it Need fear no shame nor stain of such reproach As makes it shrink when with her lords' good will, Advised of all tongues near her and approved, A queen may wed the worthiest born of men Her subjects, and a warrior take to wife One that being widowed of his hand and help Were such a thing as I am. From my lord I held my kingdom; now my hand lacks his, What queen am I, and what slaves ye, that throng And threat my life with vassals, to make vile Its majesty foregone with abject fear Of my most abject? yet though I lack might Save of a woman friendless and in bonds, My name and place yet lack not, nor the state And holy magic that God clothes withal The naked word of king or queen, and keeps In his own shadow, hallowed in his hand, Such heads unarmed as mine, that men may smite But no man can dishallow. In this faith, Not to your faith I yield myself for fear, But gladly to that God's who made of me What ye nor no man mightier shall unmake, Your queen and mistress. Lead me through my streets Whose stones are tongues now crying for my blood To my dead fathers' palace, that hath oped On many kings and traitors; it may be I shall not see these walls and gates again That cast me out; but if alive or dead I come back ever to require my part And place among my fathers, on my tomb Or on my throne shall there stand graved for aye The living word of this day's work and that Which is to wreak me on it: and this town Whence I go naked in mine enemies' hands Shall be the flame to light men's eyes that read What was endured and what revenged of me. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. THE QUEEN. Time: from July 20, 1567, to May 16, 1568. Scene I. —Holyrood. Morton and Maitland. Morton. I know not yet if we did well to lay No public note of murder on the queen In this our proclamation that sets forth But the bare justice of our cause, and right We had to move against her; while her act Stands yet unproven and seen but by surmise, Though all but they that will not seem to know May know the form and very life of it, She hath a sword against us and a stay In the English hearts and envious hands that wait To strike at us, and take her name to gild And edge the weapon of their evil will Who only are our enemies, and stand Sole friends of hers on earth; for France, we see, Will be no screen nor buckler for her, though Fire were now lit to burn her body, or steel Ground sharp to shear her neck: from Catherine's mouth Had Murray not assurance, and from him Have we not word that France will stir no foot To save or spill her blood? England alone By her new-lighted envoy sends rebuke Made soft and mixed with promise and with pledge Of help and comfort to her against our part Who by this messenger imperiously Are taxed and threatened as her traitors; this Must we now answer with a brow as free And tongue as keen, seeing how his queen in him Desires the charge and wardship of our prince Which we must nowise grant. Maitland. For fear's sake, no, Nor for her threats, which rather may pluck on More present peril, of more fiery foot, To the queen's life; yet surer might we stand Having the crown's heir safe and girt about With foreign guard in a strange land, than here Rocked in the roar of factions, his frail head Pillowed on death and danger; which once crushed, And that thin life cut off, what hand puts forth To take the crown up by successive right But theirs that would even now dip violent hand In the dear heart's blood of their kinswoman, That it might take this kingdom by the throat When she was slain? and rather by our mean Would they procure her slaying than by their own Make swift the death which they desire for her, And from our hands with craft would draw it down By show of friendship to her and threat of arms That menace us with mockery and false fear Of her deliverance by their swords, whose light Being drawn and shining in our eyes should scare Our hearts with doubt of what might fall if she Stood by their help rekingdomed, and impel Even in that fear our hands to spill her blood That lag too long behind their wish, who wait Till seeing her slain of us they may rise up Heirs of her cause and lineage, and reclaim By right of blood and justice and revenge The crown that drops from Stuart to Hamilton With no more let or thwart than a child's life Whose length should be their pleasure's: and with these Against our cause will England league herself If yet the queen live prisoner of our hands And these her kin draw swords for her; but they, Though England know not of it, nor have eye To find their drift, would mix their cause with ours, If from the queen's head living we should pluck The royal office, and as next in blood Instate them regents; who would reign indeed Rather by death's help if they might, and build On her child's grave and hers their regency, Than rule by deputation; yet at need Will be content by choice or leave of us To take the delegated kingdom up And lack but name of king: which being installed I doubt they think not long to lack, or live Its patient proxies ever. So the land, Shaken and sundered, looks from us to these, From these again to usward, and hears blown Upon the light breath of the doubtful hour Rumours of fear which swell men's hearts with wrath To hear of southern wars and counsels hatched That think with fright to shrink them up, and bind Their blood's course fast with threats. Let England know, Her menace that makes cold no vein of ours May heat instead the centre and the core Of this land's pulse with fire, and in that flame The life we seek not and the crown it wears Consume together. France will rest our friend Whether the queen find grace to live in bonds Or bleed beneath our judgment; he that comes On errand thence to reconcile with us Her kin that stand yet on the adverse part Hath but in charge to do her so much good As with our leave he may, and break no bond That holds us firm in friendship; if we will, She may be held in ward of France, and live Within the bound there of a convent wall Till death redeem her; but howe'er he speed Who hath commission with what power he may To make of our twain factions one such league As may stand fast and perfect friend with France, And in what wise by grace of us he may To do our prisoner service and entreat That grace to drop upon her, this main charge He needs must keep, to hold allied in one Scotland and France, and let our hand not plight Fresh faith instead with England; so for us From France looks forth no danger though she die, For her no help; and these void English threats, That bring no force to back them but their own And find not us unfriended, do but blow The embers that her life still treads upon Which being enkindled shall devour it. Morton. Ay, And each day leaves them redder from the breath That through the land flies clamorous for her blood From lips which boast to bear upon them laid The live coal burning of the word that God Gives them to speak against her; the south towns Are full of tongues that cry on our delay To purge the land plague-stricken with her life; He first who never feared the face of man, John Knox, and Craig his second, fill men's ears With words as arrows edged and winged to slay; And all the wide-mouthed commons, and more loud The women than their men, stretch their shrill throats With cries for judgment on her: and herself, As parcel of the faction for her death, Takes part with them against her friends, and swears To the English envoy who was charged by stealth To plead with her for mercy on her life And privily persuade her, as we find, To cast out Bothwell from her secret thought, She would die first ere so divorce her soul From faith and hope that hangs on him and feeds Her constant spirit with comfort which sustains His child alive within her; for she thinks Haply to move men's hearts even by the plea That hardens them against her, being believed, For the false fruit's sake of her fatal womb, The seed of Bothwell, that with her should burn Rather than bring forth shame, and in this land Become a root of wars unborn and fire Kindled among our children. Maitland. Nay, this plea Can be but somewhile to defend her life And put back judgment; never could she think, Though love made witless whom the world found wise, His seed might reign in Scotland. Morton. We are not So barren of our natural brood of kings As to be grafted from so vile a stock Though he were now cut off who grows yet green Upon the stem so shaken and pierced through With cankers now that gnaw the grain away; Nor if the child whom whatsoe'er he be We for the kingdom's comfort needs must seem To take for true-begotten, and receive As issued of her husband's kingly blood, Should live not to take up with timely hand The inheritance whereto we hold him born, Should the crown therefore by his death derive To the queen's kin, or hand of Hamilton Assume the state and sway that slides from his His father hath a brother left alive, The younger son of Lennox, wko might put More hopefully his nephew's title on Than leave it for the spoil of hungry hands That would make war upon our present state, Unseat the rule of stablished things, unmake The counsel and the creed whereby we stand, And Scotland with us, firm of foot and free Against the whole face of the weaponed world: But this boy's crown shall be a golden ring To hoop and hold our state and strength in one And with the seemly name of king make sure The rent bulk of our labouring commonwealth And solder its flawed sides; his right of reign Is half our gift who reign in him, and half His heritage of blood, whose lineal name Shall not by note of usurpation strike With strangeness or offence the world's wide ear That hears a Stuart our prince's uncle crowned In the dead child's succession, and this state Made safe in him and stable to sustain What chance abroad may range or breed at home Of force to shake it. Maitland. While the child lives yet, A nearer hope than of his father's kin Looks fairer on us; yet in that life's wreck This rope might hold at need. Morton. Ay, or we fall, Who stand against the house of Hamilton In this man's name; his kinsman Ruthven, Mar, Myself and Athol, who sustain his cause Against their part alone. Maitland. So do you well; Yet had I rather on the queen's appeal, In her dead father's and her young child's name Pleading for life, with proffer to resign Her kingdom to the council's hands or his Whom it may mark for regent, she might live Even yet our titular queen, and in her name The council govern of our trustiest heads, While in safe ward of England or of France Far from his kindred might her son grow safe, And under strange and kindlier suns his strength Wax ripe to bear a kingdom; to this end Save Bothwell's life I see no present let, Who lives her shame and danger, but being slain Takes off from her the peril of men's tongues And her more perilous love that while he lives It seems will never slacken till her life Be made a prey for his, but in his death Dies, or lives stingless after; wherefore most It now imports us to lay hand on him And on that capture to proclaim divorce Between them ere he die, as presently His death should seal it and his blood subscribe. So might she live and bring against our cause No blame of men or danger. Morton. In my mind Better it were to crown her son for king And send her for safe keeping hence in guard To live in England prisoner while we stand As safe from her as blameless of her blood Who reigning but in name on us should reign Indeed on all our enemies' hopes, and turn From us the hopeless hearts of half our friends For the bare name's sake of her seeming reign And mask of false-faced empire. Maitland. As I think, The main mind of the council will not bend To any reason on our parts proposed For her removal hence or titular reign, Nor with the breath of our advice be blown Beside their purpose; if the queen consent That her son's head be hallowed with her crown And hers be bare before him, she shall live, And that close record of her secret hand, The proofs and scriptures in her casket locked That seal her part in Darnley's bloodshedding, Shall yet lie dumb in darkness; else, I dread, She shall be tried by witness in them writ And each word there be clamorous on men's tongues As the doom uttered of her present death. And not more instant should her judgment be Than her swift execution; for they think, I know, to find no safety while she lives; So that in no case shall she pass alive Out of this realm while power is in their lips To speed or stay her. Morton. They shall never think To set before all eyes the whole tale forth In popular proof and naked evidence To plead against her; Balfour, that betrayed Her counsels to us, should then have done more scathe Than ever he did service; they must know It were not possible to let this proof Stand in the sun's sight, and such names be read For partners of her deed and not her doom As Huntley's and Argyle's. Have they not heard What should suffice to show if there be cause To seal some part yet of this secret up, How dearly Bothwell held those privy scrolls Preserved as witness to confound at need The main part of his judges, and abash Their sentence with their clear complicity In the crime sentenced? yea, so dear a price He set on these, that flying for life he sends Dalgleish his trustiest servant from Dunbar To bring again from Balfour's hands to his The enamelled casket in whose silver hold Lay the queen's letters and the bond subscribed Which at Craigmillar writ a live man dead. This was a smooth and seasonable hour For one of so soft spirit and tender heart To send and seek for love of good days gone A love-gift that his lady brought from France To hold sweet scents or jewels; and the man That to his envoy so delivered it And sent our council warning to waylay And where to intercept it, this was one Meet for such trust and amorous offices, Balfour, that yielding us the castle up Yields likewise for a sword into our hands To take by stroke of justice the queen's life His witness with what words she tempted him From her own lips, how lovingly and long, To kill her husband; yet he durst not; then How at her bidding he might well take heart, She said, to do it; yet he stood fearful off; Whereat she brake into a glimmering wrath That called him coward and bade him live assured If his tongue ever let this counsel forth By her sure mean and suddenly to die. Maitland. This were a sword to drink her life indeed But that my hope is better of the lords Than that their heart is fixed upon her death; And for the commons and their fiery tongue, The loud-lipped pilot of their windy will, This famine of their anger shall feed full And slake its present need but with the spoil Made of the piteous remnants of her faith By the stout hand here of their friend Glencairn, Who from this chapel of her palace rends All holy ornament, grinds down with steel The images whereon Christ dies in gold, Unsanctifies her sovereign sanctuary, Unmoulds her God and mints and marks him new, And makes his molten chalices run down Into strange shape and service; this should ease, Meseems, the hunger of the hate they bear That creed for which they held her first in hate; And for the secular justice to be done For his death's sake whom all these loathed alive, It should content them that the trial has past On those we held in hand, and by this test The man whose marriage masque on that loud night Was pretext for the queen to lie apart From the near danger of her husband's bed, Sebastian, stands approved as innocent And no part of her purpose; while the twain Who bore the charge that was to load with death The secret house, and to their master's hands Consigned the mean of murder, have endured The perfect proof of torture, and confessed In the extreme pang of evidence enforced The utmost of their knowledge. Morton. These may serve To allay men's instant angers; but much more His face should profit us whom France detains With suit and proffer from the queen-mother With all their force and flower of war or craft To help him to the crown of his own land Or throne at least of regency therein, If he will but take France for constant friend And turn our hearts with his from England: this Would Catherine give him for his friendship's sake Who gives her none for all this, but his hope Cleaves yet to England, though for fraud or fear Again it fail him; so being foiled and wroth, He hath, she tells him, a right English heart, And in that faith withholds him craftily From his desired departure and return, Which should be more of all this land desired Than of himself; this Elphinstone that comes For him from Paris, in his master's name To plead as in her brother's for the queen, Bears but the name of Murray in his mouth, Whose present eye and tongue, whose spirit and mind, Our need of him requires. When their intent Shall by the lords in council be made known To him that stands here for Elizabeth, How in her name will he receive the word That but from Murray's lip she thinks to hear, And then determine with what large response For peace or war she may resolve herself? Maitland. If she shall find our council one in will To shed by doom of judgment the queen's blood, Even by Throgmorton's mouth I am certified That she will call on France to strike with her For this their sister's sake, and join in one Their common war to tread our treason down; Or if she find not aid of France, from Spain Will she seek help to hold our French allies With curb and snaffle fast of Spanish steel, For fear their powers against her lend us might That would not lend against us; she meantime, While Philip's hand hath France as by the hair, Shall loosen on us England, to redeem That forfeit life which till the day of fight Her trust is but in Murray to preserve, Seeing he spake never word in English ear Against this queen his sister. Morton. Being returned, He shall bear witness if his heart be bent Rather to this queen's love or that queen's fear Than to the sole weal of his natural land That hath more need he should take thought for her Than one of these or the other. If the lords Be purposed, as I guess, to bid the queen Ere this month end make choice of death or life, To live uncrowned and call her young son king Or die by doom attainted, none but he By her submission or her death must rise Regent of Scotland; and each hour that flies With louder tongue requires him, and rebukes His tardiness of spirit or foot to flee By swift and private passage forth of France To where our hearts wait that have need of him. Scene II. —Lochleven Castle. The Queen and Mary Beaton. Queen. I would I knew before this day be dead If I must live or die. Why art thou pale? It seems thou art not sad though I sit here And thou divide my prison; for I see Thine eye more kindled and thy lip more calm And hear thy voice more steadfast than it was When we were free of body; then the soul Seemed to sit heavy in thee, and thy face Was as a water's wearied with the wind, Dim eye and fitful lip, whereon thy speech Would break and die untimely. Do these walls And that wan wrinkling water at their foot For my sake please thee? Thou shouldst love me well, Or hate, I know not whether, if to share The cup wherein I drink delight the lip That pledges in it mine. Mary Beaton. If I be pale, For fear it is not nor for discontent Here to sit bounded; I could well be pleased To shoot my thoughts no further than this wall That is my body's limit, and to lead My whole life's length as quiet as we sit Till death fulfilled all quiet, did I know There were no wars without nor days for you Of change and many a turbulent chance to be Whence I must not live absent. Queen. Hast thou part, Think'st thou, as in time past, predestinate In all my days and chances? Mary Beaton. Yea, I know it. Queen. If thou have grace to prophesy, perchance Canst thou tell too how I shall fare forth hence, If quick or dead? I had rather so much know Than if thou love or hate me. Mary Beaton. Truly then My mind forecasts with no great questioning You shall pass forth alive. Queen. What, to my death? Mary Beaton. To life and death that comes of life at last; I know not when it shall. Queen. I would be sure If our good guardian know no more than thou; I think she should; yet if she knew I think I should not long desire to know as much, But the utmost thing that were of her foreknown Should in mine eye stand open. Mary Beaton. She is kind. Queen. I would she were a man that had such heart; So might it do me service. Mary Beaton. So it may. Queen. How? in her son? Ay, haply, could I bring Mine own heart down to feed their hearts with hope, They might grow great enough to do me good. I tell thee yet, I thought indeed to die When I came hither. 'Tis but five weeks gone— Five, and two days; I keep the count of days Here; I can mind the smell of the moist air As we took land, and when we got to horse I thought I never haply might ride more, Nor hear a hoof's beat on the glad green ground, Nor feel the free steed stretch him to the way Nor his flank bound to bear me: then meseemed Men could not make me live in prison long; It were unlike my being, out of my doom; Free should I live, or die. Then came these walls And this blind water shuddering at the sun That rose ere we had ten miles ridden; and here The black boat rocked that took my feet off shore, And set them in this prison; and as I came The honey-heavy heather touched my sense Wellnigh to weeping; I did think to die And smell nought sweeter than the naked grave. Yet sit we not among the worms and roots, But can see this much—from the round tower here The square walls of the main tower opposite And the bare court between; a gracious sight. Yet did they not so well to let me live, If they love life too; I will find those friends That found these walls and fears to fence me with A narrower lodging than this seven feet's space That yet I move in, where nor lip nor limb Shall breathe or move for ever. Mary Beaton. Do you think You shall not long live bound? Queen. Impossible. I would have violent death, or life at large; And either speedy. Were it in their mind To slay me here and swiftly, as I thought, Thou wouldst not here sit by their leave with me; They get not so much grace who are now to die And could not need it; yet I have heard it said The headsman grants what sort of grace he may— A grievous grace—to one about to bleed That asks some boon before his neck lie down; Thy face was haply such a boon to me, Being cradle-fellows and fast-hearted friends, To see before I died, and this the gift Given of my headsmen's grace; what think'st thou? Mary Beaton. Nay, That I know nought of headsmen. Queen. Thou hast seen— It is a sharp strange thing to see men die. I have prayed these men for life, thou knowest, have sent Prayers in my son's and my dead father's name, Their kings that were and shall be, and men say One was well loved of the people, and their love Is good to have, a goodly stay—and yet I do not greatly think I fear to die. I would not put off life yet; if I live, For one thing most shall these men pay me dear, That I was ever touched with fear of death. Thou hast heard how seeing a child on the island once Strayed over from the shore, I cried to him Through the pierced wall between five feet of stone To bid my friends pray God but for my soul, My body was worth little; and they thought I was cast down with bitter dread of heart; Please God, for that will I get good revenge. I dream no more each night now on my lord, And yet God knows how utterly I know I would be hewn in pieces—yea, I think— Or turned with fire to ashes for his sake: Surely I would. Enter Lady Lochleven. Lady Lochleven. Good morrow to your grace. Queen. Good madam, if the day be good or no Our grace can tell not; while our grace had yet The grace to walk an hour in the sun's eye With your fair daughters and our bed-fellows About your battlements that hold us fast, Or breathe outside the gateway where our foot Might feel the terrace under, we might say The morn was good or ill; being here shut up, We make no guesses of the sun, but think To find no more good morrows. Lady Lochleven. Let your grace Chide not in thought with me; for this restraint, That since your late scarce intercepted flight Has been imposed upon me, from my heart I think you think that I desired it not. Queen. Ay, we were fools, we Maries twain, and thought To be into the summer back again And see the broom blow in the golden world, The gentle broom on hill. For all men's talk And all things come and gone yet, yet I find I am not tired of that I see not here, The sun, and the large air, and the sweet earth, And the hours that hum like fire-flies on the hills As they burn out and die, and the bowed heaven, And the small clouds that swim and swoon i'the sun, And the small flowers. Now should I keep these things But as sweet matter for my thoughts in French, To set them in a sonnet; here at home I read too plain in our own tongue my doom, To see them not, and love them. Pardon me; I would have none weep for me but my foes, And then not tears. Be not more discontent Than I to think that you could deem of me As of one thankless; who were thankless found, Not knowing that by no will or work of yours I sit suppressed thus from the sun; 'tis mine, My fault that smites me; and my masters' will, Not mine or yours it is, that for my fault Devised this penance; which on me wrought out May fall again on them. Lady Lochleven. Madam, alas, I came on no such errand to your grace As lacked more words to make it sad than those It was to speak; and these have I put back Too long and idly. Here are now at gate Three messengers sent from the parliament To speak with you. Queen. With us to speak? you know, Nor chamberlain nor herald have we here To marshal men before us. Let them come, Whom all our kingdom left could keep not out From this high presence-chamber. Stay; I would not Be stricken unaware, nor find in you That which I thought not; it were out of kind, Unwomanlike, to give me to their hands Who came to slay me, knowing not why they came; Is it for that? Lady Lochleven. God's grace forbid it! nay— Queen. I ask if they bring warrant for my death? I have seen such things and heard, since leaves bloomed last, That this were no such marvellous thing to hear. But if this be, before I speak with them, I will know first. Lady Lochleven. Let not your highness dread— Queen. I do not bid you put me out of dread. Have you not heard, and hear? The queen desires To know of her born subject till she die And keeper of her prison, if these men Be come to slay her. Lady Lochleven. They come to bid your grace— Queen. Bid my grace do their bidding? that is like: That I should do it were unlike. I must live, I see, this some while yet. What men are these? Lady Lochleven. The first, Sir Robert Melville; then the lords Ruthven and Lindsay. Queen. Bid my first friend in, While one friend may be bidden; he, I think, Can come but friendlike. [Exit Lady Lochleven. What should these desire? One head of theirs I swore last month to have, That then beheld me, some day, if that hand Whereon I swore should take not first my life. And one the son of him that being nigh dead Rose from his grave's edge to pluck down alive A murdered man before him—what should he Bring less than murder, being his father's son, In such a hand as his that stabbed my friend? Mary Beaton. Perchance they come to take your crown, not life. Queen. What, my name too? but till I yield it them, They have but half the royal thing they hold, The state they ravish; and they shall not have My name but with my life; while that sits fast, As in my will it sits, I am queen, and they My servants yet that fear to take my life; For so thou seest they fear; and I did ill, That in first sight of present-seeming death Made offer to resign into their hands What here is mine of empire: I shall live, And being no queen I live not. Enter Sir Robert Melville. Welcome, sir; I have found since ever times grew strange with me Good friends of your good brother and yourself, And think to find. What errand have you here? Sir R. Melville. Let not your majesty cast off the thought Which calls me friend, though I be first to bear An evil errand. 'Tis the council's mind That you shall live, and in their hand the proofs Shall die that plead against you— Queen. Is this ill? I know not well what proof that man could show Would prove men honest that make war on faith, Show treason trusty, bleach rebellion white, Bid liars look loyal; and much less I know What proof might speak against me from their lips Whose breath may kill and quicken evidence, Or what good change of mind rebuke the lie That lived upon them; but that I must live, And of their proofs unspotted, sounds not worse Than if a friend had come to bear me word That I must die belied. Sir R. Melville. Upon these terms Are they content for you to live in ward; That you yield up as with free hand the crown And right of kingdom to your son, who straight At Stirling shall receive it from their hands; Else shall your grace be put to trial, and bear The doom ensuing, with what of mortal weight May hang upon that sentence. Queen. Sir, methought This word of doom for shame's sake now was dead Even in their mouths that first it soiled, and made Even shamelessness astonished; not again We thought to hear of judgment, we that are, While yet we are anything, and yet must be, The voice which deals, and not the ear which takes, Judgment. God gave man might to murder me, Who made me woman, weaker than a man, But God gave no man right, I think, to judge, Who made me royal. Come then, I will die; I did not think to live. Must I die here? Sir R. Melville. Madam, my errand— Queen. Ay, sir, is received Here in my heart; I thank you; but you know I had no hope before; yet sounds it strange That should not sound, to die at such men's hands, A queen, and at my years. Forgive me, sir; Me it not comforts to discomfort you, Who are yet my friend—as much as man on earth— If any, you—that come to bid me die. Sir R. Melville. Be not cast down so deep: I have an errand From the English queen, your friend, and here ensheathed By my sword's secret side, for your fair hand A letter writ from her ambassador Praying you subscribe what thing my comrades will, Since nought whereto your writing was compelled Can hang hereafter on you as a chain When but for this bond written you stand free. Queen. Ay, I know that: how speaks Elizabeth? Sir R. Melville. She bids you at all times account of her As a sure friend and helpful; has, I know, Indeed no mind to fail you. Queen. This your comfort Is no small comfort to me; I had rather Be bounden to her than any prince alive. Is it her counsel then that I subscribe My traitors' writing? I will do it. But, sir, Of those that sit in state in Edinburgh Which was it chose you for my comforter? I know my lord of Morton would send none; It was the secretary? Sir R. Melville. Madam, the same. Queen. Did I not well then, think you, when I cast This body of mine between him and the swords That would have hewn his body? I did think He was my friend. Bid now mine enemies in, And I will sign what sort of shame they will, And rid them hence. Enter Lindsay and Ruthven. 'Tis five weeks gone, my lord, [To Lindsay. Since last we looked on you; for you, fair sir, [To Ruthven. A year I think and four good months are sped Since at that father's back whose name you bear I saw your face dashed red with blood. My lords, Ye come to treat with us ambassadors Sent from our subjects; and we cannot choose, Being held of them in bonds from whom ye come, But give you leave to speak. Lindsay. Thus, briefly, madam. If you will live to die no death by doom, This threefold bond of contract that we bring Requires your hand; wherein of your free will First must you yield the crown of Scotland up To your child's hand; then by this second deed The place and name of regent through this realm To the earl of Murray shall you here assign, Or, if he list not take this coil in hand, Then to the council; last, this deed empowers The lords of Mar and Morton with myself To set the crown upon the young king's head. These shall you sign. Queen. These I shall sign, or die. But hear you, sirs; when hither you brought these, Burned not your hearts within you by the way Thinking how she that should subscribe was born King James's daughter? that this shameful hand, Fit to sustain nor sword nor staff o'the realm, Hath the blood in it of those years of kings That tamed the neck and drove with spurs the sides Of this beast people that now casts off me? Ay, this that is to sign, no hand but this Throbs with their sole inheritance of life Who held with bit and bridle this bound land And made it pace beneath them. What are ye That I should tell you so, whose fathers fought Beneath my fathers? Where my grandsire fell And all this land about him, was there none That bore on Flodden, sirs, such names as yours, And shamed them not? Heard no men past of lords That for the king's crown gave their crown of life For death to harry? Did these grieve or grudge To be built up into that bloody wall That could not fence the king? Were no dead found Of that huge cirque wherein my grandsire lay But of poor men and commons? Yea, my lords, I think the sires that bred you had not heart As men have writ of them, but sent to fight For them their vassals visored with their crests, And these did well, and died, and left your sires That hid their heads for ever and lived long The name and false name of their deeds and death. How should their sons else, how should ye, being born, If born ye be, not bastards, of those lords Who gat this lying glory to be called Loyal, and in the reek of a false field To fall so for my fathers—how, I say, Dare sons of such come hither, how stand here, From off the daughter's head of all those kings To pluck the crown that on my fathers' heads Ye say they died to save? I will not sign; No, let some Flodden sword dip in my blood; Here I sit fast, and die. Good friend that was, [To Sir R. Melville. Tell my great sister that you saw my hand Strive and leave off to sign; I had no skill To shape false letters. Ruthven. Madam, no man here But knows by heart the height of your stout words And strength of speech or sweetness; all this breath Can blow not back the storm yourself raised up Whose tempest shakes the kingdom from your hand, And not men's hate. You have been loved of men; All faith of heart, all honour possible, While man might give, men gave you. Now, those deeds Which none against your will enforced you do Have set that spirit against you in men's minds That till you die (as then your memory may) Nor your fair beauty nor your fiery heart Can lay with spells asleep. Sir R. Melville (aside). I pray you, madam, Think on mine errand. Queen. Wherefore should I sign? If I be queen that so unqueen myself, What shall it profit me to give my foes This one thing mine that hallows me, this name, This royal shadow? If I be no queen, Let me bleed here; as being uncrowned I know That I shall die of all your promises. Lindsay. We came not, madam, to put force on you, And save your life by violence; but take note [Laying his hand on her arm. As in this hand your own is fast, and hath No power till mine give back its power again To strive or sign, so fast are you in ward For life or death of them that bid you live And be no queen, or die. Queen. I thank you, sir, That of your love and courtesy have set This knightly sign upon my woman's flesh For proof if I be queen or no, that bear Such writing on my body of men's hands To seal mine abdication. Sirs, read here; What need I sign again? here may men see If she be queen of Scotland on whose arm Are writ such scriptures as I wist not yet Men's eyes might read on any woman born. Yet will I write, being free, to assure myself This is my hand indeed that wears the sign Which proves it vassal to the stronger. Sirs, Take back your papers; and albeit, my lord, The conquest you have made of me henceforth Lift up your heart with pride, I pray you yet Boast not yourself on women overmuch, Lest being their conqueror called and praised for that Men call you too their tyrant. Once and twice Have we grasped hands; the third time they shall cross Must leave one cold for ever. Nay, I pray, Who may command not surely, yet I pray, Speak not, but go; ye have that ye came for; go, And make your vaunt to have found so meek a thing As would yield all, and thank you. [Exeunt Lindsay, Ruthven, and Sir R. Melville. Hast thou read Of sick men healed with baths of children's blood? I must be healed of this my plague of shame, This sickness of disgrace they leave with me, Bathing in theirs my body. Mary Beaton. In such streams You have washed your hands already. Queen. What, in war? Ay, there I have seen blood shed for me, and yet Wept not nor trembled; if my heart shrink now, It is for angry pity of myself That I should look on shame. Mary Beaton. What shame, my queen? Queen. Thy queen? why, this, that I, queen once of Scots, Am no more now than thine. Call back the lords; I will unsign their writing, and here die; It were the easier end. Mary Beaton. It is your will— Forgive me, madam—on this cause again To grapple with Lord Lindsay? Queen. True, not yet; Thou thought'st to make me mad, remembering that; But it hath made me whole. My wits are sound, Remembering I must live. When I have slept, Say I would gladly see the kindlier face Again of our dear hostess with her son To put those angry eyes out of my sight That lightened late upon me; say, being sad, And (if thou wilt) being frighted, I must find The comfortable charities of friends More precious to me. 'Tis but truth, I am fain, Being tired, to sleep an hour: mine eyes are hot; Where tears will come not, fire there breeds instead, Thou knowest, to burn them through. Let me lie down; I will expect their comforts in an hour. [Exeunt. Scene III. —Holyrood. Maitland and Sir Nicholas Throgmorton. Throgmorton. Why would your council give no ear to me Ere they rode hence so hot to crown their prince? Why hear not first one word? Maitland. One threat the more From your queen's lips bequeathed by rote to yours, Or one more promise? If we run her course, This queen will leave us in the briars, we know, There to lie fast or labour till the thorns Have rent our flesh and raiment. Throgmorton. Sir, take thought If help were sent not at the siege of Leith, When France had grasped you by the throat, and sea To land gave battle, from that sovereign's hand Whom now ye trust not. Maitland. Ay, for her own ends She cast the French out and flung back their power Which here was deadly to her, and of that deed Had recompense with surety: but what aid Must we now look for of her, on whose will Hang all our enemies' hopes? I would I had been Banished seven years my country, and your queen On that condition had but as a friend Dealt freely with us. Let her now proclaim, Her own seed failing, this our prince her heir, And England shall no less have care of him Than we his lineal servants; else, if hence We yield him to your keeping, men will say We have given our natural master to be kept As among wolves a sheep, and made our hope The fosterling of danger: and small trust Should we put in her that has newly dealt By secret message to subvert our state, We know, with those indeed of our queen's kin From whose report we know it. Throgmorton. What have they said? Maitland. That you brought proffers of her aid and love To incite their arms, to quicken the slow snake Whose sting lies cold yet in their policy, But watched and warmed of her with hand and eye The perfect poison should put forth, and thrust At once the hot and cloven tongue of war Even in our face and bosom; but for fear, It may be, or being yet at heart's root Scots,— For this or that cause, through false heart or true, So is it, that in doubt of your good mind Toward them or Scotland, in whose breast you sought To make the mutual swords of her own sons Clash as they crossed once more, drinking her blood, They sent us word of all your embassy. Throgmorton. But you, whate'er these thought or feigned to think, Think no such foolish evil as fools may, Deem not of England as the Scot who deems She hath no will, no line of life, no hope, No thought but Scotland's ruin, and our queen No sense of aught here done—her sister's doom, The people's rage, the council's purpose—nought But where to find in these a guileful mean To strike at Scotland? why, these fears are old, White-bearded dreams, suspicions long grown grey, Dangers and doubts toothless and eyeless now That fright nor babe nor dotard; and your thought Finds room for such? What profit should she have To turn your swords against each other's throats And pick some privy chance of vantage up That fell between your factions at her feet? Such chance indeed of vantage might there fall For your own queen, who nowise has been slow To nurse the chance and wait on it and serve, From strifes rekindled and requickening claims Set each at each in England, whence or craft Or force might filch or seize for Scotland's sake Some no less jewel than her eye ere now Was fixed so fast on, even the crown that hangs In doubt yet of unsure inheritance, As hangs not yours for us to pluck at, who, Reign whoso may when this queen's life is quenched, In Scotland shall reign never. Maitland. That I know, And this no less; that he who reigns shall reign Never by right of England's leave or love, Her ward or servant; as, this queen removed, Haply ye hope her lineal heir might be, And in that hope work with these Hamiltons To strike at us in Mary's name, and pluck Death from our hands upon her; you, your queen, And they her kinsfolk, all ye seek her death; No word but of her freedom in your mouths, No end than this less looked for in your hearts. Speak to the council as but now to me, Defy them in her cause, not all the world For three days' space shall save her. Throgmorton. Nay, not we Desire the queen's death at your hand provoked, But here from Tullibardine's mouth I know Her kin at secret heart desire no less, And will ye but allow their house its right By heritage to reign, no need, they say, To take more care for her, who privily May be put out of life, and no man more In that dead name be troubled; and again, If they with no such promise being assured Shall not join hands with you, and England then Shall bring the queen back whom ye spared to slay, Ye are lost and they not winners. Therefore is it, That of Lord Mar and of yourself I seek Help for the queen's deliverance, who being dead Can profit no man but your foes and ours That love not England more than they love you Nor you than they love England: shall not both With their own cause take part? Maitland. It is too late; What part should we take with you, to what end, Since all the council knows your traffic now With their chief foes, and how being there betrayed You can but bring us such a friendship back As they would none of? Throgmorton. Sir, if yet you fear, If you suspect yet that our queen desires To speed the death of yours or make it sure By pleading for her, or by threat of war Denounced for her sake, let this letter be The seal and warrant of our single heart, Wherein she threatens war—but smile not yet— If in his mother's name for him discrowned Ye crown the child that has but wailed one year. This should the lords have seen; but even for doubt Lest it should set their spirits on such fire As but her blood shed presently could slake, And this be deemed its aim indeed at heart And privy purpose of her hand who writ, Your eye alone must read that reads it now And the lord Murray's; for they know that send And with it send me this for secret charge, They know the truth and heat of fiery will That urges our queen's heart upon this war, And for no end but for her sake who sits Held fast in bonds of her own subjects born, And with her all the majesty on earth That walks with monarchs, and no king alive But wears some shameful parcel of her chain. Maitland. Though this be truth, yet they that hold it false Will join in wrath with them that hold it true, Even for the threat's sake and for shame, will join To write red answer in the slain queen's blood Back to the queen that threatens. Nay, herself Who sits in bonds yet of us will not yield To come forth singly safe, nor give consent That Bothwell should fare worse than she, or have More harm or danger; and being thus incensed, A three-edged weapon in the council's hand Is drawn to smite at need, a treble charge Whereon to impeach her; on that statute first Made of this land's religion seven years since, Which though she signed not, yet its breach in her Shall stand for guilt before them; and thereto Shall she be challenged of incontinence With more than Bothwell, who by noteless nights Have made her bed adulterous; and of each The proof that seals her shame in him, they say, Lies in their hand; last, of her murdered lord Their warrant cries against her; and from these No man may think to quit her nor secure, Save he that here comes timeliest for such toil As none beside may take upon his hand. Enter Murray. Welcome, my lord, and to a land that lacks As never yet it lacked or looked for you. What comfort bring you for her wounds from France Besides that present help of hand and head We heard returned an hour since? Murray. Sir, thus much; All of our faith in France will in our cause Live or die fighting; gold and men in arms Will flow thence on us in full stream and free If Scotland set but open hand or breast To greet them coming; they will buy our love At what best price they may. Throgmorton. But you, my lord, That have loved England ever, and that know The worth and unworth weighed of either friend, French faith or English, will not surely buy With heavy hate of England the light love That France and fraud would sell you, nor for this Cast off the fortune and the peace unborn That may bind fast in one strong ring of sea Two jewels become one jewel, one such land As from the stout fort of a single heart Fixed like a sea-rock might look forth and laugh Upon the under wars of all the world And see not higher the heads of kingdoms risen Than of small waves in summer? will you pluck This hope out of the hopeful hand of time Ere he can gather, this good fruit that grows On the green present branch of time's grey tree To feed the future where the hungry past Could get but blood for bread, and with bare steel Died starved and smitten? Murray. Sir, when I came in By secret flight from France, out of the guard Wherein I lived inwalled with watch of men That the court set about me to withhold My foot from England—when an English boat Had borne me oversea by secret night From privy port to port, at the long last I saw your queen's face darken on mine own As on a servant favour-fallen, that came To take rebuke and speak not; in her speech I found no note of favour, no good word, Nor honour such as late in France I found And finding fled from: sharply with strange eyes She glanced against me; taxed me with the bonds Wherein men held my sister; half a threat Was all her promise: I returned but this, I would be still a Scotsman, and this land I had more mind to serve and do her good Then either of these queens; so parted thence Unfriendlike, yet with no breach openly Proclaimed of friendship; and being here my mind Is yet to serve no mistress but alone This earth my bones were bred of, this kind land Which moulded me and fostered; her strong milk Put manhood in my blood, and from my heart If she that nurtured need it now to drink I think not much to shed it. If those lords In whom her power now stands shall with one mouth Bid me put on this weight of regency, For no man's fear shall I deny them; she, Your queen that threatens me with ignominy If I obey their choice and call, must know That to God only and my heart, those twain That are one eye to know me and to judge, Will I refer it; and of them being known That with pure purpose and no soiled intent I take this charge up, I will bear it through To the right end. Yet ere my mind be fixed, I will behold her that was queen, and see How sits the spirit within her; but howe'er, Till Bothwell in our hands lie trapped and dead She must not pass forth free; and we will hold No traffic for the bear's skin merchant-like Before the bear be caught; but if your queen Proclaim against us therefore war, be sure We will not lose our lives, yield up our lands, And bear repute of rebels through the world, Who might, how loth soe'er, in all men's eyes Make our cause clear as righteousness; the proofs Which in our hands lie darkling yet, but bear The perfect witness of those ill deeds past That bring her thus in danger of our doom And righteous peril of all-judging law, Must to the world's eye nakedly set forth What cause is hers, and ours; when if I stand In the king's likeness of the state elect, To him in me shall all knees bend and hearts Kneel subjected; for them that hold apart, No head shall stand of any Hamilton That shall not bow before my sword or me. Scene IV. —Lochleven Castle. The Queen and George Douglas. Queen. Will he be here to-day? Alas, my friend, I made my hope of this till he should come, And now he comes I would not look on him. I know not what put hope into my fear That this your mother's and my father's son Should do me good for evil. George Douglas. Madam, I think The mind can be but good that marshals him To your fair presence; nay, though even his soul Were damned so deep as to desire your death, He durst not come to show us his purpose here Who were not chosen for murderers at his hire But guards and servants that would shed their lives Ere yours should look on danger. Queen. That we know, And have no better wage than love to give, Which more to give we grudge not, being so poor, Than from your queen's hands you disdain to take: But what knows he? for aught our brother knows, Your mother and yourself are envious guards That hate me for my faith as for my fault And hold your hands but till he bids you slay Or yield me to my slayers. Ah my last knight, You shall do well to leave me at my need; He will command you; when this brother knows I am not hated, think you then my friend Shall not be chidden from me? George Douglas. When my life Is bidden from my body; not till then Shall I be found obedient. Enter Lady Lochleven. Queen. Be but wise, And wisdom shall not let you disobey. Our noble hostess, you have borne a son, I dare not say more noble, but I dare More simple than his elders; one whose heart Stands fast when fortune stands not, and requires, As other men do power and glory and gold, No guerdon but the memory writ of him To have been most true when fortune was most false, And most to have loved whom she most hated: this Shall not of them be written. Come you not To bring one to me that shall never sin As he by faith and folly? I would say Of my great brother and your kingly son Nothing but good; yet can nor you nor I Say that he loves me and my fallen estate More than the power he comes to take from me, Or rather from their hands that ere he came Had rent it out of mine. Nay, look not sad; You should be merrier than my mother might, Were she now living. Lady Lochleven. God shall witness me What joy I have of such a guest, or pride To be so stricken, madam, of your tongue Chastising me for triumph; if my heart Exalt itself for this day's sake, God knows, Who hears you mock me. Queen. Nay, I said no scorn; I had rather need to pray you in his name Scorn not at me. Let him come in; I know What ceremony my masters should put on Were but to mock their servant. Enter Murray, Athol, and Morton Sirs, you twain That brought me two months since between you safe Out of the town by night that sought my blood Myself bid welcome; but she is not I That in this presence should make welcome here My father's son; nor shall my speech usurp For modesty that office: yet indeed I am glad, my lord, to see your face, that must Bring comfort, or an end of all this life That yet needs comfort. Murray. What I may, I will; Yet haply shall you find not in my words Or death or comfort; as you give them heed, Shall they prove comfortable or deadly. Sirs, I have that to speak and hear that but requires The Lady Mary's ear and mine; I pray you, Take not offence that I crave leave to say We must for some space lack your company. Morton. My lord, the land that puts her trust in you Bids us obey, well knowing that love nor fear Shall bend you from her service. Lady Lochleven. Sir— Murray. Your will? Lady Lochleven. I am no parcel of the sovereign state That gives you of its greatness, nor have right To speak commandingly; yet ere I go I would desire you by what name I may, Look on this lady with such equal eyes As nor the wrath and hate of violent men, Nor sense of evil done to this land's peace By her mischance and evil counsellors, Nor (what I would not fear to find in you) Desire of rule with pride of station, may Divert to do her wrong or glance aside From the plain roadway of that righteousness Whose name is also mercy. This at least Surely by me may be of you required, That in this house no wrong by word or act, By deed or threat, may touch her. Murray. Be assured No wrong shall ever touch her by my hand; And be content to know it. Queen. Madam, these lords Know that I thought ere this to find of you A mediatress between me and your son; I have my hope, and with a humble heart I take your intercession thankfully. [Exeunt all but the Queen and Murray. Murray. I would I had another cause to speak Or you to listen, than this bitter theme That brings us back together, though for that I had died a foreign man. Queen. I thought not, sir, When we last parted ere the break of spring, To meet you thus in summer; but these months Have wrought things stranger on me. Murray. Say, yourself Have made of them more strange and perilous use Than is the fruit they bear. I am not come To flatter with you; that I seek your death I think you fear not, yet should surely know The man that seeks were now more like to speed Than he that would preserve it. Heaven and earth As with the tongue of one same law demand Justice against you; nor can pity breathe But low and fearful, till the right be weighed That must in pity's spite and fear's be done, Or this land never thrive. For that right's sake And not for hatred or rebellious heart Do men require that judgment pass on you And bring forth execution; the broad world Expects amazedly when we that rule Shall purge this land of blood, which now looks red In the world's eye, and blushing not for shame Blushes with bloodshed; in men's general mouths The name of Scot is as a man's attaint Of murderous treason, or as his more vile That for base heart and fear or hire of gold With folded hands watches the hands that slay Grow great in murder; and God's heavy doom Shall be removed not from us, nor his wrath, Well may we fear, shall lighten, till the deed That reeks as recent yet toward the fair heavens Be thoroughly cleansed with judgment. Queen. Must I too Bleed to make Scotland clean of baser blood Than this she seeks of mine? Murray. If you shall die, Bethink you for what cause, and that sole thought Shall seal your lips up from all pride of plea That would put in between your deed and doom The name of queen to cover you. No age That lived on earth red-handed without law Ever let pass in peace and unchastised Such acts as this that yet in all men's ears Rings as a cry unanswered. When your lord Lay newly murdered, and all tongues of friends Were loud in prayer to you to save your name From stain of accusation, and yield up That head to judgment which the whole world held Blood-guilty, first with subtle stretch of time Did you put back the trial, then devise To make it fruitless save of mockery; next, I cannot say for shame what shame foregone Moved you to put upon this loathing land That great dishonour to behold and bear The man your lover for its lord, and you Queen of all Scots and thrall of one most base, While yet the ring was from his finger warm That sealed it first, and on his wedded hand The young blood of your husband, ere the print Had cooled of marriage or of murder, you In the hot circle of his amorous arms A new-espoused adulteress. Will you say You were enforced or by false counsels bent To take him to your bosom? In what eye Was not the foregone commerce of your loves As bare as shame? what ear had heard not blown His name that was your sword and paramour, Whose hand in yours was now as steel to slay, Now as a jewel for love to wear, a pledge Hot from your lips and from your husband's heart? Who knew not what should make this man so proud That none durst speak against him of your friends But must abide for answer unaware The peril of the swords that followed him? Went he not with you where you went, and bade Men come and go, do this or do not, stand Or pass as pleased him, ere that day had risen Which gave the mockery of a ravished bride To the false violence of his fraudful rape That hardly she could feign to fear, or hide The sweetness of the hour when she might yield That which was his before, and in men's eyes Make proof of her subjection? Nay, forbear; Plead not for shame that force was put on you To bear that burden and embrace that shame For which your heart was hungry; foe nor friend Could choose but see it, and that the food desired Must be but mortal to you. Think on this, How you came hither crowned these six years gone In this same summer month, and with what friends Girt round about and guarded with what hopes, And to a land how loving; and these years, These few brief years, have blown from off your boughs All blossom of that summer, though nor storm Nor fire from heaven hath wrecked nor wind laid low That stately tree that shadowed a glad land, But now being inly gnawn of worms to death And made a lurking-place for poisonous things To breed and fester at its rotten root, The axe is come against it. None save you Could have done this, to turn all hearts and hands That were for love's sake laid before your feet To fire and iron whetted and made hot To war against you. No man lives that knows What is your cause, and loathes not; though for craft Or hope of vantage some that know will seem To know not, and some eyes be rather blind Than see what eyeless ignorance in its sleep, If but it would, must needs take note of; none Whose mind is maimed not by his own mere will And made perforce of its own deed perverse Can read this truth awry. What have you done? Men might weep for you, yea, beholding it The eyes of angels melt; no tide of tears Could wash from hand or soul the sinful sign That now stands leprous there; albeit God knows Myself for very pity could be glad By mine own loss to ransom you, and set Upon your soul again the seal of peace And in your hand its empire; but your act Has plucked out of men's hearts that fain would keep The privilege of mercy; God alone Can lose not that for ever, but retains For all sins done that cry for judgment here The property of pity, which in man Were mere compliance and confederacy With the sin pardoned; so shall you do best, Being thus advised, to entertain the hope Of nothing but God's mercy, and henceforth Seek that as chiefest refuge; for in man There shall no trust deliver you, nor free Body nor soul from bonds. Weep not for that; But let your tears be rather as were hers That wept upon the feet of God, and bought With that poor price her pardon. Queen. So should I, If grief more great may buy it than any of theirs That had sinned more than I; nay, such have been And have been pardoned. I have done ill, and given My name for shame to feed on, put mine honour Into mine enemies' keeping, made my fame A prey and pasture for the teeth of scorn; I dare not say I wist not by what mean I should be freed of one that marred my life, Who could by no mean else be quit of him Save this blind way of blood; yet men there were More wise than I, men much less wronged of him, That led me to it and left me; but indeed I cite not them to extenuate by strange aid Mine own rash mind and unadvisedness That brought forth fruit of death; yet must you know What counsels led me by the hand, and whence My wrath was fostered; and how all alone, How utterly uncomforted, and girt With how great peril, when the man was slain, I stood and found not you to counsel me, And no man else that loved; and in such need If I did ill to seek to that strong hand Which had for me done evil, if evil it were To avenge me of mine enemy, what did they That by their hands and voices on his side Put force on me to wed him? yet I say not I was indeed enforced; I will not mock With one false plea my penitent heart, nor strive With words to darken counsel, nor incense By foolishness your wisdom, to provoke A judgment heavier than I wait for; nay, You have not said that bitter thing of me That I may dare unsay; what most I would, I must deny not; yet I pray you think, Even as might God, being just, what cause I had, What plea to lighten my sore load of sin, Mismated and miscounselled, and had seen Of my sad life not wholly nineteen years When I came hither crowned; as yet would God Your head, my brother, had endured for mine That heaviness of honour, and this hand The weight of Scotland, that being laid in mine Has fallen and left it maimed, and on my brows A mark as his whose temples for his crime Were ringed with molten iron. Take them now, Though but for pity of me that pray you take, And bear them better than I did; for me, Though no plea serve me in the sight of man Nor grace excuse my fault, I am yet content, If I may live but so much time in bonds As may suffice for God to pardon me, Who shall not long put off to pardon, then Shut eyes and sleep to death. Murray. I had thought to-night To speak no more with you, but let that hope Which only in God's name I gave you bear What fruit it might with prayer and watching; yet Take comfort, and assure yourself of life, And, if it may be, honour; one of these I may take on me to redeem, and one So as I may will I preserve from death Dealt of men's tongues that murder it; but you, Keep these things in your heart; that if you raise Within this realm a faction, or devise To break these bonds, I shall not keep an hour This power I have to save you; nor shall keep, If France or England be by word of yours Stirred up to strike at our frail peace; nor yet If you shall cleave to him that should for shame As from this land be cast out from your heart; But if toward God your faults be faithfully In good men's sight acknowledged, and that life You led with your false lord and all sins past Loathed and lamented, and in days to be The living purpose in you manifest Of a more modest habit and a life More nobly fashioned—if the slaughter done On your dead husband seem of you abhorred And those ill days misliked wherein your fame Drank mortal poison from his murderer's hand— If this be seen, and that your mind lives clear From counsel of revenge upon those lords Who sought your reformation, nor with hope Nor dangerous forethought of device to be Renews itself to do them some day wrong; Then may you now sit safe, and unreproved Expect an end of bondage; for at large You cannot think to live yet, who in time May haply by repentance be restored And for your prison somewhile here endured Find yet your throne again, and sit renewed More royal than men wist who saw the ship Put in from France that bore you. Queen. O my friend, O brother, found now father to me too, Who have raised and rebegotten me from death, By how much less I thank you for my life Think so much more for honour I give thanks That you raise up the hope in me to have Which was nigh dead for shame. O, let me hold [Embracing him. My comfort in mine arms, and with dumb lips Kiss you my thanks; I looked for less than this, But yet for comfort of you. One thing more, Having so much, will I require, and cease— Even for my son's sake and mine own to lay The charge upon you of this regency Which none might bear so noble, nor bring back Her peace again to Scotland, as I know Your hand shall bring; and had I known betimes I had not started from its curb aside Nor set against its strength in no good hour The feebleness of mine: but if your heart Be large enough to let forgiveness in Of my wrongs done and days of wanton will, Take this charge too, to keep for me the forts Of all that was my kingdom; I would have Nothing of mine lie now not in your hand; Keep too my jewels; all I had of worth, What help without you should I have of it, What profit or what surety? let your heart Cast her not out who prays you of your grace Take these in trust and me. Murray. I may not these, But you that put yourself into my trust I will not fail. Queen. Nay, you shall keep them too. Murray. I would not put my hand forth uncompelled To take for life and death the burden up That burns as fire and bows the back that bears As with an iron load; and certainly He that shall take this kingdom on his hand I think shall live not long; nor pride nor hope But very love and strong necessity Could only bow me down to obey their will Who should enforce on mine the task to bear This grievous office, that if Scotland bid I for her sake must bear till I may die. But if I be not bidden, for no love Or fear or lust of kingdom will I seek The labour and the grief of that great charge That I may live and feel not. Queen. By my lips, That have no royal right to speak for her Now, think that yet she bids you, seeing none else To undo mine evil done on her, and heal The wounds mine enemies and myself have made In her sweet peace: she hath no stay but you; Whom other should she seek to? and for me Again I dare not urge you, but my heart Is turned into a prayer that pleads with yours To lend its weakness comfort of your strength By taking off its fears; these that break mine Can bow not yours: O, take from me that weight Which were to you but sport and ornament, The natural honour of a hand so strong And spirit elect of all men's souls alive To do a work imperial. Murray. If not else, But by me only may this land find peace, By me then shall it; for your private charge, Impute not to me for default of love That I beseech you lay no more on me Than public need enforces; in my trust Your treasures were no safer than they stand Now that I keep them not, and no man's tongue Can tax me with them as detained from you By fraud or usurpation; which mine ear Were loth to know was muttered. Queen. But you see Nor they nor I have surety save in you; Let it be seen of them that else may doubt How thankfully I trust you; even for that Do thus, to do me good in men's report When they shall see us at one; from mine own hand Except you take them shall they not be rent By craft or force of hidden or harrying hands That could not wrest from yours what mine must yield For fault of you to help me? Murray. As you will. I would not cross you where I might content, Yet willingly I cannot take on me More charge than needs of privy trusts to keep That bring men's blame about them; but in this My will shall be your servant. Re-enter Lady Lochleven and George Douglas. For this time I take farewell; be patient, and seek peace Whence God may send it.—To your gentler hand, While yet the Lady Mary lives in ward, Behoves not me commend her, being but bound As reverently as may beseem your son In the state's name to charge you that she find At all men's hands that guard her now about Good usage with safe keeping; which to assure Shall hardly need this young man's service here, For whom the state has other use, and I A worthier work than still to keep such watch As porters use or pages. Lady Lochleven. He and I Stand at your bidding; yet were nowise loth The state that gave should take this charge away It laid upon us. Queen. Sir, the grace you brought And comfort to me sorrowing and afraid Go ever with you; and farewell. Murray. Farewell. [Exeunt Lady Lochleven and Murray. Queen. Will you not go? George Douglas. Whither you bid, and when, I will go swiftly. Queen. With your lord and mine, I would have said; yet irks it me to say My lord, who had none under heaven, and was Of these my lords once lady. Said I not You should do well to cast off care of me Whom you must leave indeed now at command More powerful of more potent lips than mine? I would not have you set your younger will Against his word imperial; nor, I think, Doth he fear that who bids us come and go And whose great pleasure is that you part hence And I sit here: be patient, and seek peace, You heard him bid me; patience we must have If we would rest obedient; and for peace, So haply shall we find it, having learnt What rest is in submission. George Douglas. Bid me stay, And that my will shall part not hence alive What need I swear? Queen. Alas, your will may stay, Your will may wait on me to do me good, Your loves and wishes serve me when yourself Shall live far off; our lord forbids them not; It is the service of your present hand, The comfort of your face, help of your heart, That he forbids me. George Douglas. And though God forbade Save by my death he should compel me not To do this bidding; only by your mouth Of all that rule in heaven and earth will I Be willingly commanded. Queen. You must go. Nay, I knew that; how should one stay by me? There was not left me, by God's wrath or man's, One friend when I came hither in the world; And from the waste and wilderness of grief If one grain ripen—from the stone and sand If one seed blossom—if my misery find One spring on earth to assuage its fiery lip— How should I hope that God or man will spare To trample or to quench it? George Douglas. I am here While you shall bid me live, and only hence When you shall bid me but depart and die. Queen. There was a time when I would dream that men There were to do my bidding; such as loved And were beloved again, and knew not fear Nor hope but of love's giving; but meseemed That in my dream all these were cast away, And by God's judgment or through wrath of men Or mine own fault or change and chance of time, I lived too long to look for love in vain. Many there are that hate me now of men; Doth one live yet that loves? George Douglas. If one there were That for your love's sake should abhor his life, Hating all hope save this, to die for you, What should he do to die so? Queen. If I bade That for my love's sake he should love his life And use its strength to cherish me, who knows If he would heed? or say I gave command To do some ill thing or of ill report— Were it to slay our brother now gone hence— Would one do that? I would not have it done, Though I should bid him. Do not answer me, As though I questioned with you seriously Or spake of things that might be thought upon, Who do but jest with grief as with my friend That plays again familiarly with me, And from the wanderings of a joyless wit Turn to clasp hands with sorrow. You must go. George Douglas. Ay, when you bid; but were my going from you Part of your grief, which is more grief to me Than my soul's going from forth my body were, I would not set my face from hence alive. Queen. I hold it not for no part of my grief To bid you from me; yet being here bound in As I with walls and waters, we should find Less help than yet I hope for of your hand Being hence enlarged. We will take counsel, sir, And choose, with no large choice to make of friends, To whom we shall appoint you, by what mean To deal for our deliverance: as with one Once of my household and this lady's kin Who here of all my Maries the last left Partakes my bonds: the laird of Ricarton, My husband's kinsman; and what readiest friends Once more may be raised up, as when I fled From shame and peril and a prison-house As hateful as these bonds, to find on earth— Ah, no such love and faith as yours in man. Scene V. —Holyrood. Murray and Morton. Murray. I am vexed with divers counsels, and my will Sees nor its way nor end. This act proclaimed That seals the charge of murder on the queen To justify our dealing had to it hands That here first met; Kirkaldy with Glencairn, Balfour with Maitland, Huntley with Argyle, True man with traitor, all were as one mind, One tongue to tax her with complicity, Found art and part with them that slew her lord; Men praised the council for this judgment given As from a single and a resolute soul; Scarce one withstood save Herries, and his voice Was as a wind that sings in travellers' ears Unheeded; then the doom that gives to death All that in act maintain the former faith And writes for Catholic traitor, should have purged The state of treacherous or of dangerous friends Such as made protest then against this law And fled from our part to the Hamiltons, Caithness and Athol, with the bishop called Of Murray, whom the Assembly met to judge By one same doom has with Argyle condemned To stand in sackcloth for adulteries past At Stirling through the time of service held Within the chapel royal; such men's stay It irks not me to lose, who by their loss Were fain to win their enemies for my friends More fast and faithful: but men's sundering minds Nor council nor assembly can reknit, Though Knox there sit by Maitland, and Balfour Touch sides with Craig; and while the state as now Lives many-minded and distraught of will, How shall its hope be stable? Morton. Some there are Have all their will, or more than we that rule By secular wit and might; the preachers reign With heavier hand than ours upon the state, Who in this late assembly by their doom Bade your fair sister of Argyle partake The sackcloth penance of her slippery lord For scandal to the Kirk done when last year At the font's edge her arms sustained our prince For baptism of such hands as served the mass; If it have leave long to sit lawgiver, Their purity will pinch us. Murray. Have no fear; It shall not Douglas: and we lack their help Who sway the commons only with their breath, Now most of all when our high counsels fail And hopes are turned as 'twere to running streams That flow from ours to feed our enemies' hands With washings of our wreck, waifs of our strength, That melts as water from us; those chief twain Whose league I sought by marriage, and had hope To bind them to us as brethren, when Argyle With me should knit himself anew, to wed His brother to the sister of my wife With happier hope than he espoused mine own, While Huntley's son should lead my daughter home, And with this fourfold knot our loves be tied And fortunes with each other's growth ingraffed— Both these look back now toward the Hamiltons To mingle factions with them, being assured Our hands now lack the secret sword we had To draw at need against them, since their names Set at Craigmillar to the bond of blood Are with that bond consumed, and no tongue left To wag in witness of their part of guilt Now Bothwell's knaves are hanged that laid the train And Hay with them, and one most near his trust, His kinsman Hepburn, from whose mouth condemned And Ormiston's we have confession wrung That marks with blood as parcel of their deed More than Balfour that in the assembly sit And must partake his surety; this, my lord, Craves of us care and counsel, that our names Be writ not fool or coward, who took in hand Such trust to work such treason. Morton. Nay, no Scot Shall say we fell from faith or treacherously Let men's hopes fade that trusted us, and sank Through feebleness of ours; yet have we strength To lower the height of heart and confidence That makes their faction swell, who were but late Too faint of spirit, too fearful and unsure, To be made firm with English subsidies; Three thousand marks that Scrope by secret hand Sent from Carlisle to Herries could not serve To give or shape or sinew to their plots Who are now so great their house's heir must need No lowlier than a queen, and Bothwell's wife, For this divorced or widowed. Murray. Ay; we know The archbishop his good uncle with this youth Hath in Dumbarton fortified himself, And while they there sit strong and high in hope Our prisoner and our penitent late, we hear, Grows blithe of mood and wanton; from her sight Have I dismissed my mother's youngest born, Lest in her flatteries his weak faith be snared And strangled with a smile; and for her hand I have found a fitter suitor than Arbroath When she shall wed again, within whose veins Some drops of blood run royal as her own; Methuen, whose grandsire was the third that set His ring on that queen Margaret's wedded hand From the seventh Henry sent ambassadress To our fourth James, to bring for bridal gift Her father's love and England's to her lord And with the kiss of marriage on his lips To seal that peace which with her husband's life Found end at Flodden from her brother's hand That split the heart of Scotland. So the queen, If she wed Methuen, shall espouse a man Whose father of the same queen's womb was born That bore her father; and whose blood as hers Is lineal from the seed of English kings Through one same mother's sons, queen once of Scots And daughter born and sister, though unqueened, Of those twain Henries that made peace and war With Scotland and her lord; and by this match The Hamiltons being frustrate of their hope Could yet not tax us with a meaner choice Than they would make for her, who while she lives Must stand thenceforth far off from their designs And disallied from all that in her name Draw now to head against us; and some help We need the more to cross them now, that France, To whom I thought to seek as to my friend And thence find aid in this necessity That else finds none, since England's jealous craft Puts in our enemies' hands gold for a sword More sharp than steel—France, that would send at need The choice of all her sons that hold our faith To live and die beside us here in arms, Grows chillier toward us than the changing wind That brings back winter: for the brood of Guise, Our prisoner's friends and kinsmen of Lorraine, Prevail again on Catherine's adverse part, Whose hate awhile gives way to them, and yields Our cause into their hands that were more like To help this daughter of their dangerous house Take up the crown resigned and through their strength Renew this kingdom's ruin with her reign, Than send us aid and arms to guard its peace From inroad as from treason: which I doubt We shall hear news of from my brother's tongue Enter Sir William Douglas. Who comes without a herald. Sir W. Douglas. Sir, the news Is dashed with good and evil equally That here I bring you; for the treasons laid Have missed their mark and left unwounded yet My house's honour that retains in trust So great a charge. You had word ere this of me By what strange fortune was their plot made known Who thought to fall upon us unaware And find a ferry for some seventy swords To cross the lake in mine own barge surprised And smite those thirty guards that hold the walls And make a murderous passage for the queen To come forth free with feet that walked in blood; And how by one a Frenchman of her train Who being not in their counsel heard some speech Of such a preparation, and conceived This was a plot to take her from your hand Laid by the fiercer faction of the Kirk That sought to snare and slay her in your despite, To me was all discovered; and betimes I gave command no barge thenceforth should pass Between the main shore and mine island walls, But a skiff only that with single oars Might be rowed over. Baffled thus, her friends Were fain to buy the boatman's faith with gold, Whom on suspicion I dismissed, but since Finding less trust and service in the knave That had his place, called back and bade take heed Of these that would have won to their device A foundling page within my castle bred And called by mine own name; who by this plot Should have seduced for them my sentinels And oped the gate by night; but yet I find For all toils set and gins to take their faith In him and them no treason; yet so near Was treason to us, that not long since the queen Had wellnigh slipped beyond our guard by day In habit of a laundress that was hired So to shift raiment with her; but being forth Betimes as was this woman's use to come In the low light by dawn, at such an hour As she was wont to sleep the morning out, The fardel in her hand of clothes brought forth And on her face the muffler, it befell That as she sat before the rowers and saw Some half her free brief way of water past, By turn of head or lightning of her look For mirth she could not hide and joyous heart, Or but by some sweet note of majesty, Some new bright bearing and imperious change From her false likeness, so she drew their eyes That one who rowed, saying merrily Let us see What manner of dame is this, would fain pluck down Her muffler, who to guard it suddenly Put up her fair white hands, which seeing they knew And marvelled at her purpose; she thereat, A little wroth but more in laughter, bared Her head and bade stretch oars and take the land On their lives' peril; which regarding not, They straight put back as men amazed, but swore To keep fast locked from mine of all men's eyes The secret knowledge of this frustrate craft, So set her down on the island side again With muffled head and hidden hands, to wring And weep apart for passion, where my watch Looks now more strict upon her; but I think, For all her wrath and grief to be by chance From her near hope cast down and height of mind Wherein she went forth laughingly to find What good might God bring of her perilous hour, She hath lost not yet nor changed that heart nor hope, But looks one day to mock us. Murray. So I think; And in that fear would have you keep fast watch By night and day till we take off the charge Laid on your faith, and or enfranchise her Or change her place of ward; which, ere the spring That holds in chase this winter's flying foot Be turned to summer, haply shall be done. What fashion holds our mother with the queen? Sir W. Douglas. As she was ever tender of her state And mild in her own office, so she keeps Observance yet and reverence more than meet Save toward a queen, toward this her guest enforced Who smiles her back a prisoner's thanks, and sighs That she should smile in prison; but 'twixt whiles Some change of mood will turn to scorn or spleen Her practised patience, and some word take wing Forth from her heart's root through her lips that hath The gall of asps within it; yet not this Turns the heart hard or bitter that awaits Her gentler change, pitying the wrong it bears And her that wrongs it for the sorrow's sake That chafes and rends her. Murray. Pity may she give And be praised for it; but to entertain Hope or desire that wars against her trust Should turn that praise to poison. Have you seen Since George went thence, or noted ere he went, In her no token of a mingled mind That sways 'twixt faith and such a faithless hope As feeds a mother's love with deadly dreams Of prophesying ambition? for in him I spied the sickness of a tainted heart And fever-fired from the most mortal eyes That ever love drank death of. Sir W. Douglas. No, my lord. Murray. I would fain trust her mind were whole in this And her thoughts firm; yet would not trust too far, Who know what force of fraud and fire of will In that fierce heart and subtle, without fear, That God hath given so sweet a hiding-place, Make how much more the peril and the power Of birth and kinglier beauty, that lay wait For her son's sake to tempt her. We will hold More speech of this; here shall you rest to-night. [Exeunt. Scene VI. —Lochleven Castle. The Queen and Mary Beaton. Queen. Is it not sunset? what should ail the day To hang so long in heaven? the world was blind By this time yesternight. The lake gleams yet; Will the sun never sink, for all the weight That makes this hour so heavy? Mary Beaton. While you speak, The outer gate that stands till nightfall wide Shuts on the sundown; and they bring the keys That soon the page shall put into our hand To let in freedom. Queen. I could weep and laugh For fear and hope and angry joy and doubt That wring my heart. I am sick at once and well: Shall I win past them in this handmaid's dress If we be spied? My hood is over broad; Help me to set it forward; and your own Sits loose; but pluck it closer on your face For cloak and cover from the keen moon's eye That peers against us. Twice, thou knowest, yea thrice, God has betrayed me to mine enemies' hands Even when my foot was forth; if it slip now, He loves nor kings that hold his office here Nor his own servants, but those faithless mouths That mock all sovereignties in earth or heaven. If here he fail me and I fall again To sit in bonds a year—by God's own truth, I swear I will not keep this wall of flesh To cage my spirit within these walls of stone, But break this down to set that free from these, That being delivered of men's wrongs and his It may stand up, and gazing in his eyes Accuse him of my traitors. Mary Beaton. Keep good heart; Your hope before was feverish and too light, And so it failed you: in this after plot There is more form and likeness than in those That left you weeping; let not passion now Foil your good fortune twice, or heat of mood From keen occasion take the present edge And blunt the point of fortune. Queen. If I knew This man were faithful—O, my heart that was Is melted from me, and the heart I have Is like wax melting. Were my feet once free, It should be strong again; here it sinks down As a dead fire in ashes. Dare we think I shall find faith in him, who have not found In all the world? no man of mine there is, None of my land or blood, but hath betrayed, Betrayed or left me. Mary Beaton. Nay, too strange it were That you should come to want men's faith, and look For love of man in vain; these were your jewels, You cannot live to lack them; nay, but less; Your common ornaments to wear and leave, Your change of raiment to cast off, and bind A fresher robe about you: while men live And you live also, these must give you love, And you must use it. Queen. So one told me once— That I must use and lose it. If my time Be come to need man's love and find it not, I have known death make a prophet of a man That living could foretell but his own end, Not save himself, being foolish; and I too, I am mad as he was, now to think on him Or my dead follies. Were these walls away, I should no more; ay, when this strait is past, I shall win back my wits and my blithe heart, And make good cheer again. Enter Page. Page. Here are the keys; I had wrought instead a ladder for our need With two strong oars made fast across, for fear I had failed at last from under my lord's eye To sweep them off the board-head; here they ring, As joy-bells here to give your highness note The skiff lies moored on the island's lee, and waits But till the castle boats by secret hands Be stripped of oars and rowlocks, and pursuit Made helpless, maimed of all its means; the crew Is ready that shall lend us swifter wing Than one man's strength to fly with; and beyond Your highness' friends upon the further bank Wait with my master's horses; never was A fairer plot or likelier. Queen. How thy face Lightens! Poor child, what knowest thou of the chance That cast thee on my fortunes? it may be To death ere life break bud, and thy poor flower The wind of my life's tempest shall cut off, And blow thy green branch bare. Many there be Have died, and many that now live shall die, Ere my life end, for my life's sake; and none There is that knows, of all that love or hate, What end shall come of this night's work, and what Of all my life-days. I shall die in bonds Perchance, a bitter death; yet worse it were To outlive dead years in prison, and to loathe The life I could not lose. This will not be; No days and nights shall I see wax and wane, Kindled and quenched in bondage, any more; For if to-night I stand not free on earth As the sun stands in heaven, whose sovereign eye Next day shall see me sovereign, I shall live Not one day more of darkling life, as fire Pent in a grate, bound in with blackening bars, But like a star by God hurled forth of heaven Fall, and men's eyes be darkened, and the world Stand heart-struck, and the night and day be changed That see me falling. If I win not forth, But, flying, be taken of the hands that were Before laid on me, they shall never think To hold me more in fetters, but take heart To do what earth saw never yet, and lay By doom and sentence on their sovereign born Death; I shall find swift judgment, and short shrift My justicers shall give me; so at least Shall I be quit of bondage. Come, my friends, That must divide with me for death or life This one night's issue; be it or worst or best, Yet have ye no worse fortune than a queen, Or she than ye no better. On this hour Hang all those hours that yet we have to live: Let us go forth to pluck the fruit of this That leans now toward our hand. My heart is light; Be yours not heavier; for your eyes and mine Shall look upon these walls and waves no more. [Exeunt. Scene VII. —The Shore of Loch Leven. George Douglas, Beaton, Ricarton, with Attendants. George Douglas. I hear the beat of the oars: they make no haste: How the stars thicken! if a mist would take The heaven but for an hour and hide them round— Ricarton. How should they steer them straight? we lacked but light, And these are happy stars that sign this hour With earnest of good fortune; and betimes See by their favour where the prize we seek Is come to port. Enter the Queen, Mary Beaton, Page, and a Girl attending. Queen. Even such a night it was I looked again for to deliver me, Remembering such a night that broke my bonds Two wild years past that brought me through to this; The wind is loud beneath the mounting moon, And the stars merry. Noble friends, to horse; When I shall feel my steed exult with me, I will give thanks for each of your good deeds To each man's several love. I know not yet That I stand here enfranchised; for pure joy I have not laid it yet to heart; methinks This is a lightning in my dreams to-night That strikes and is not, and my flattered eyes Must wake with dawn in bonds. Douglas, I pray If it be not but as a flash in sleep And no true light now breaking, tell me you, That were my prison's friend; I will believe I am free as fire, free as the wind, the night, All glad fleet things of the airier element That take no hold on earth; for even like these Seems now the fire in me that was my heart And is a song, a flame, a burning cloud That moves before the sun at dawn, and fades With fierce delight to drink his breath and die. If ever hearts were stabbed with joy to death, This that cleaves mine should do it, and one sharp stroke Pierce through the thrilled and trembling core like steel And cut the roots of life. Nay, I am crazed, To stand and babble like one mad with wine, Stung to the heart and bitten to the brain With this great drink of freedom; O, such wine As fills man full of heaven, and in his veins Becomes the blood of gods. I would fain feel That I were free a little, ere that sense Be put to use; those walls are fallen for me, Those waters dry, those gaolers dead, and this The first night of my second reign, that here Begins its record. I will talk no more Nor waste my heart in joyous words, nor laugh To set my free face toward the large-eyed sky Against the clear wind and the climbing moon, And take into mine eyes and to my breast The whole sweet night and all the stars of heaven, But put to present work the heart and hand That here rise up a queen's. Bring me to horse; We will take counsel first of speed, and then Take time for counsel. Beaton. Madam, here at hand The horses wait: Lord Seyton rides with us Hence to Queen's Ferry, where beyond the Forth We reach Claude Hamilton, who with fresh steeds Expects us; to Long Niddry thence, and there Draw rein among the Seytons, ere again We make for Hamilton, whose walls should see The sun and us together. Queen. Well devised. Where is the girl that fled with us, and gave These garments for my surety? she shall have Her part in my good hour, that in mine ill Did me good service. Ricarton. Madam, she must stay; We have not steeds enough, and those we have May bear no load more than perforce they must, Or we not hope to speed. Queen. Nay, she shall go, Not bide in peril of mine enemies here While we fly scatheless hence. Girl. Most gracious queen, Of me take no such care: I am well content They should do with me all they would, and I Live but so long to know my queen as safe As I for her die gladly. Ricarton. She says well; Get we to horse. I must ride south to rouse My kinsfolk, and with all our Hepburn bands Seize on Dunbar; whence northward I may bear Good tidings to your lord. Queen. God make them good That he shall hear of me, and from his mouth Send me good words and comfort! You shall ride Straight from Lord Seyton's with my message borne To all good soldiers of your clan and mine And wake them for our common lord's dear love To strike once more, or never while they live Be called but slaves and kinless: then to him For whom the bonds that I put off to night Were borne and broken. Douglas, of that name Most tender and most true to her that was Of women most unfriended, and of queens Most abject and unlike to recompense, Take in your hand the hand that it set free, And lead me as you led me forth of bonds To my more perfect freedom. Sirs, to horse. [Exeunt. Scene VIII. —Hamilton Castle. The Queen, Argyle, and Huntley. Queen. I ever thought to find your faiths again When time had set me free; nor shall my love To my good friends be more unprofitable Than was my brother's, from whose promised hand Both have withdrawn the alliance of your own To plight once more with mine: your son, my lord, And, noble sir, your brother, will not fail Of worthier wedlock and of trustier ties Than should have bound them to a traitor's blood, His daughter, and the sister of his wife, Whom he so thought to honour, and in them Advance his counsels and confirm his cause Through your great names allied, who now take part More worthily with one long overthrown And late re-risen with many a true man's more And royally girt round with many a friend's; Nor need we lay upon our kinsmen here All our hope's burden, nor submit our hand To marriage with our cousin's of Arbroath For fault of other stay. For mine own mind, I would stand rather on Dumbarton rock Walled in with Fleming's spears, than here sit fast With these six thousand ranged about the walls That five days' suns have brought to strengthen me Since I fled hither in these poor same weeds That yet for need I wear. Now, by the joy I had that night to feel my horse beneath Bound like my heart that through those darkling ways Shot sunwards to the throne, I do not think Thus to sit long at wait, who have the hands Subscribed here of so many loyal lords To take no thought but of their faith to me Nor let dissension touch their hearts again Till I sit crowned as arbitress of all When the great cause is gained. Each bloodless day Makes our foes greater; from Dunbar Lord Hume, Who thence with hand too swift cut off our friends, Brings now six hundred to my brother's flag Who hangs hard by us, and from Edinburgh Grange leads his hundreds; all the Glasgow folk, For love of Lennox, with the Lothian carles, Draw round their regent hither; and God knows These are no cowards nor men vile esteemed That stand about him; better is he served Of them than we of Herries, whose false wit Works with an open face and a close heart For other ends than live upon his tongue And fill with protestation those loud lips That plead and swear on both sides; he would stand My counsellor, yet has not craft enough To draw those enemies hence that watch us here By tumult raised along the border side For none to quell but Murray, who was bound From Glasgow where he lies yet to Dumfries, But halts to gather head and fall on us When we set forth; which by my private will I would not yet, but that my kinsmen yearn To bid him battle and with victory won Seize to themselves the kingdom by my hand, Which they should wield then at their will, and wed To their next heir's; so should ye have their seed For kings of Scotland, who were leagued ere this With our main foes, and to their hands but late By composition and confederacy Would have given up my life to buy their ends Even with the blood whose kinship in their veins They thought should make them royal. Argyle. We must fear These days that fleet and bring us no more strength Bring to the regent comfort and good hope From England of a quiet hand maintained Upon the borders and such present peace As fights against us there upon his side While he stands fast and gathers friends, who had But common guard about him when your grace Fled hither first, yet would not at the news For dread of our near neighbourhood turn back With that thin guard to Stirling; and by this The chiefs of all his part are drawn to him, Morton and Mar, Semple with Ochiltree, And they that wrung forth of your royal hand The writing that subscribed it kingdomless: All these are armed beneath him. Queen. These are strong, Yet are our friends not weaker; twain alone, You twain with whom I speak, being on my side, I would not fear to bide the feud of these; And here are Cassilis, Eglinton, Montrose, Ross, Crawford, Errol, Fleming, Sutherland, Herries with Maxwell, Boyd and Oliphant, And Livingstone, and Beaumont that was sent To speak for France as with mine uncle's tongue Pleading with those my traitors for that life Which here he finds enfranchised; and all these As one true heart to me and faithful hand, In God's name and their honour's leagued as friends Who till mine enemies be cast down will know Nought save their duty to me, that no strife Shall rend in sunder, and no privy jar Rive one from other that stands fast by me. This have they sworn; and by my trust in them, I will not doubt with favour or with force To quell the hardiest heart set opposite. Have I not sent forth word of amnesty To every soul in Scotland free save these, The top and crown of traitors, Morton first, And Lindsay, from whose hand I took a pledge To be redeemed with forfeit of his head; Semple, that writ lewd ballads of my love, And that good provost whom I swore to give For one night's prison given me in his house A surer gaol for narrower resting-place Than that wherein I rested not; and last Balfour, that gave my lord's trust up and mine? Upon these five heads fallen will I set foot When I tread back the stair that mounts my throne; All others shall find grace; yea, though their hearts Were set more stark against me and their hands More dangerous aimed than these; for this God knows, My heart more honours and shall ever love A hardy foe more than a coward friend; And Hume and Grange, mine enemies well approved, Could love or recompense reknit their faiths To my forsworn allegiance, in mine eyes Should stand more clear than unrevolted men Whose trustless faith is further from my trust Than from my veins the nearness of their blood. I am not bitter-hearted, nor take pride To keep the record of wrongs done to me For privy hate to gnaw upon, and fret Till all its wrath be wroken; I desire Not blood so much of them that seek mine own As victory on them, who being but subdued For me may live or die my subjects: this I care not if I win with liberal words Or weapons of my friends, for love or fear, Or by their own dissensions that may spring And blossom to my profit; and I hold Nor fear nor grief grievous nor terrible That might buy victory to me, for whose sake Peril and pain seem pleasant, and all else That men thirst after as I thirst for this, Wealth, honour, pleasure, all things weighed therewith Seem to my soul contemptible and vile. Nor would I reign that I might take revenge, But rather be revenged that I might reign. For to live conquered and put on defeat, To sit with humbled head and bear base life, Endure the hours to mock me, and the days To take and give me as a bondslave up For night by night to tread on—while death lives And may be found or man lay hold on him, I will not have this to my life, but die. I know not what is life that outlives hope, But I will never; when my power were past, My kingdom gone, my trust brought down, my will Frustrate, I would not live one heartless hour To think what death were gentlest; none so sharp But should be softer to my bosom found Than that which felt it strike. Huntley. You speak as ever Your own high soul and speech; no spirit on earth Was ever seen more kinglike than lifts up With yours our hearts to serve you for its sake As these have served that here would speak with you, Enter Beaton and Mary Beaton. To whom our loves yield place. [Exeunt Argyle and Huntley. Queen. My chance were ill If to no better love your loves gave way Than that which makes us friends.—You are come betimes, If you come ready now to ride; here lie The letters you must bear: the cardinal's this, Mine uncle's of Lorraine, to whose kind hand Did I commend the first news of my flight Sent from Lord Seyton's while our horses breathed; By this shall he receive my mind writ large And turn his own to help me. Look you say Even as I write, you left me in such mind As he would know me, for all past faults done Bent but to seek of God and of the world Pardon; as knowing that none but only God Has brought me out of bonds, and inly fixed In perfect purpose for his mercy shown To show a thankful and a constant heart, As simple woman or as queen of Scots, In life and death fast cleaving to his Church, As I would have him that shall read believe My life to come shall only from his lips Take shape and likeness, by their breath alone Still swayed and steered; to whom you know I look For reconciling words that may subdue To natural pity of my labouring cause The queen that was my mother and her son My brother-king that in my husband's seat Sits lineal in succession. Say too this, That without help I may not hold mine own, And therefore shall he stand the more my friend And do the kindlier the more haste he makes With all good speed to raise and to despatch A levy of a thousand harquebusmen To fill the want up of my ranks, that yet Look leaner than mine enemies'. This for France; And this to the English queen delivering say, I look being free now for that help of hers That in my last year's bonds not once or twice I had by word of promise, and not doubt This year to have indeed: which if I may, When from her hand I take my crown again, I shall thenceforth look for no other friend And try no further faith. This private word In London to the ambassador of Spain Fail not to bear, that being set round with spies I may not write; but he shall tell his king The charges that men cast on me are false, And theirs the guilt that held me in their bonds Who stand in spirit firm to one faith with him From whom I look for counsel. I well think My sister's love shall but desire to hold A mean betwixt our parties, and pronounce On each side judgment, as by right and might 'Twixt mine and me the imperial mediatress, Commanding peace, controlling war, that must Determine this dark time and make alone An end of doubt and danger; which perchance May come before her answer. Haste, and thrive. [Exit Beaton Now, what say you? shall fortune stand our friend But long enough to seem worth hope or fear, Or fall too soon from us for hope to help Or fear to hurt more than an hour of chance Might make and unmake? This were now my day To try the soothsaying of men's second sight Who read beyond the writing of the hour And utter things unborn; now would I know, And yet I would not, how my life shall move And toward what end for ever; which to know Should help me not to suffer, nor undo One jot that must be done or borne of me, Nor take one grain away. I would not know it; For one thing haply might that knowledge do, Or one thing undo—to bring down the heart Wherewith I now expect it. We shall know, When we shall suffer, what God's hour will bring; If filled with wrath full from his heavy hand, Or gently laid upon us. I do think, If he were wroth with aught once done of me, That anger should be now fulfilled, and this His hour of comfort; for he should not stand, For his wrath's sake with me, mine enemies' friend, Who are more than mine his enemies. Never yet Did I desire to know of God or man What was designed me of them; nor will now For fear desire the knowledge. What I may, That will I foil of all men's enmities, And what I may of hope and good success Take, and praise God. Yet thus much would I know, If in your sight, who have seen my whole life run One stream with yours since either had its spring, My chance to come look foul or fair again By this day's light and likelihood. Mary Beaton. In sooth, No soothsayer am I, yet so far a seer, That I can see but this of you and me, We shall not part alive. Queen. Dost thou mean well? Thou hast been constant ever at my hand And closest when the worst part of my fate Came closest to me; firm as faith or love Hast thou stood by my peril and my pain, And still where I found these there found I thee, And where I found thee these were not far off. When I was proud and blithe (men said) of heart, And life looked smooth and loving in mine eyes, Thou wouldst be sad and cold as autumn winds, Thy face discomfortable, and strange thy speech, Thy service joyless; but when times grew hard, And there was wind and fire in the clear heaven, Then wast thou near; thy service and thy speech Were glad and ready; in thine eyes thy soul Seemed to sit fixed at watch as one that waits And knows and is content with what shall be. Nor can I tell now if thy sight should put More faith in me or fear, to trust or doubt The chance forefigured in thee; for thou art As 'twere my fortune, faithful as man's fate, Inevitable; I cannot read the roll That I might deem were hidden in thy hand Writ with my days to be, nor from thine eyes Take light to know; for fortune too is blind As man that knows not of her, and thyself, That art as 'twere a type to me and sign Incognizable, art no more wise than I To say what I should hope or fear to learn, Or why from thee. Mary Beaton. This one thing I know well That hope nor fear need think to feed upon, That I should part from you alive, or you Take from me living mine assurance yet To look upon you while you live, and trace To the grave's edge your printed feet with mine. Queen. Wilt thou die too? Mary Beaton. Should I so far so long Follow my queen's face to forsake at last And lose my name for constancy? or you Whose eyes alive have slain so many men Want when death shuts them one to die of you Dying, who had so many loving lives To go before you living? Queen. Thou dost laugh Always, to speak of death; and at this time God wot it should beseem us best to smile If we must think upon him. I and thou Have so much in us of a single heart That we can smile to hear of that or see Which sickens and makes bleed faint hearts for fear; And well now shall it stand us both in stead To make ours hard against all chance, and walk Between our friends and foes indifferently As who may think to see them one day shift From hate to love and love again to hate As time with peaceable or warlike hand Shall carve and shape them; and to go thus forth And make an end shall neither at my need Deject me nor uplift in spirit, who pass Not gladly nor yet lothly to the field That these my present friends have in my name Set for the trial of my death or life. Thou knowest long since God gave me cause to say I saw the world was not that joyous thing Which men would make it, nor the happiest they That lived the longest in it; so I thought That year the mightiest of my kinsmen fell Slain by strong treason; and these five years gone Have lightened not so much my life to me That I should love it more or more should loathe That end which love or loathing, faith or fear, Can put not back nor forward by a day. [Exeunt. Scene IX. —Langside. Murray, Morton, Hume, Lindsay, Ochiltree, Sir William Douglas, Kirkaldy, and their Forces. Murray. They cannot pass our place of vantage here To choose them out a likelier. Let our lines Lie close on either side the hollow strait Flanked as the hill slopes by those cottage walls, While here the head of our main force stands fast With wings flung each way forth: that narrow street Shall take them snared and naked. Sir W. Douglas. I beseech you, If you suspect no taint or part in me Of treason in our kin, that I may have The first of this day's danger. Murray. No man here Of all whose hearts are armed for Scotland hath First place in this day's peril, no man last, But all one part of peril and one place To stand and strike, if God be good to us, In the last field that shall be fought for her Upon this quarrel. Who are they that lead The main of the queen's battle? Kirkaldy. On their left Lord Herries, and Argyle in front; with him Claude Hamilton and James of Evandale Bring up their turbulent ranks. Lindsay. Why, these keep none, That crowd against us; horse and mingled foot Confound each other hurtling as they come Sheer up between the houses. Murray. Some default That maims the general strength has in their need Held them an hour delaying: our harquebusmen, Two thousand tried, the best half of our foot, Keep the way fast each side even to this height Where stands our strength in the open. We shall have, If aught win through of all their chivalry, Some sharp half-hour of hand to hand at last Ere one thrust other from this brow. Lord Hume, Keep you the rear of our right wing that looks Toward Herries and his horsemen; Ochiltree, Stand you beside him; Grange and Lindsay here Shall bide with me the main front of their fight When these break through our guard. Let word be given That no man when the day is won shall dare Upon our side to spill one drop of blood That may be spared of them that yield or fly. [Exeunt. Scene X. —Another part of the Field. Enter Herries and Seyton, with their soldiers. Herries. If they of our part hold the hill-top yet, For all our leader's loss we have the day. Seyton. They stand this half-hour locked on both sides fast And grappling to the teeth. I would to God When for faint heart and very fear Argyle Fell from his horse before the battle met The devil had writhed his neck round; whose delay At point to charge first maimed us; else by this We had scattered them as crows. Make up again And drive their broken lines in on the rear While those in front stand doubtful. Charge once more, Enter Ochiltree and Hume, with soldiers. And all this side is ours.—Lord Ochiltree, Yield, in the queen's name. Ochiltree. In the king's I stand To bid his traitors battle. [They fight; Ochiltree falls. Herries. Stand thou too, Or give us place; I had rather have to-day At my sword's end thee than a meaner man To try this cause. Hume. This edge of mine shall try Which side and steel be truer. [They fight; Hume is wounded. Seyton. God and the queen! Set on; this height once ours, this day is too, And all days after. Herries. Halt not yet, good friends, Till with our bright swords we have crowned the hill Whereon they stand at grapple. Close again, And we ride lords at large of the free field Whence these fall hurled in sunder. Seyton. To the height! Our fellows are fast locked yet with our foes; Make up there to their comfort. Enter Lindsay, Kirkaldy, Sir William Douglas, young Ochiltree, with soldiers. Lindsay. Sirs, not yet; Ere ye win through there be more spears to break Than there in fight are fastened. Stand, or yield. Herries. The Highland folk that doubtfully held off Are fallen upon our flank; hear you the noise? Back, sirs, bear back: we are sped. [Exit with his followers. Seyton. The day is gone; Let life go after; for I will not fly To meet my queen's face as a beaten man. Enter Murray, Morton, etc. with soldiers. Murray. Charge once, and then sheathe swords; the field is ours; They fly now both ways broken. Some one spur To bid those knaves that howl upon the rear Cut short their quest of blood; they were too slack Who are now so hot, when first the hunt was up; They shall not flesh those fangs on flying men That in the fight were bloodless. Seyton. Men, stand fast; Let not the currish cry of Highland hounds Bark on your fugitive quarry: here a man May fall not like a stag or harried hare, But die more soldierlike than in the toils With their loud pack upon him. Young Ochiltree. Die then here And pay me for my father, if God please My life with his shall lie not on thy hand, But thine on mine as forfeit. [They fight; Seyton falls. Murray. Slay him not; I say, put up your sword. Young Ochiltree. Sir, pardon me; There bleeds my father yet: he too shall die. Murray. Young man, nor he nor any of his part When I say, Live. Take up your sword again; And by this hand that struck it from your own Be ruled and learn what loyal use it hath, Which is not on its prisoner. Send forth word That none take life of any man that yields; Pursue, but slay not; for the day is won; And this last battle ended that shall see By Scottish hands the reek of Scotsmen slain Defame the face of Scotland. While I live, If God as on this day be good to her, Her eyes shall look on her own blood no more. [Exeunt. Scene XI. —The Heights near Langside. The Queen, Mary Beaton, Fleming, Boyd, and young Maxwell. Queen. This is the last time I shall look on war: Upon this day I know my fate is set As on a sword's point. Does the fight stand still, That we see nothing on that hill's brow stir Where both sides lashed together? Fleming. If the light Tell mine eyes truth that reel with watching, both Stand with spears crossed and locked so hard, and points So fast inwound with such inveteracy, That steel can thrust not steel an inch away Nor foot push foot a hair's breadth back that hangs On the hill's edge and yields not. Hark! the noise Grows sharper and more various in its cry Than first it was; there comes upon the day Some change for good or ill; but for my charge, I would not say Would God my hand were there, But take its chance upon it. Queen. Be content To stand this day our soldier at her side Who will not live to lay such charge again On them that love her. Lo there, on the left They charge again from our part. Maxwell. There it is My father fights; his horse are they that make The hill's length rock and lighten as a sea; Look where the waves meet as that wind of steeds Sweeps them together; how they reel and fall There with the shock from under of the storm That takes in rear and breaks their guard and leaves The right wing of the rebels cloven in twain, And in the cleft their first men fallen that stood Against the sea-breach. O, this gallant day Shows us our fortune fair as her fair face For whom we came to seek it, and the crown That it gives back more glorious. Queen. If we knew How fares our van—Nay, go not from me one, Lest we be scattered. Boyd. Hear you not a cry As from the rear, a note of ruin, sent Higher than the noise of horsemen? and therewith A roar of fire as though the artillery there Spake all at once its heart untimely out; Pray God our powder be not spent by chance And in its waste undo us. Queen. My heart is sick, Yet shall it not subdue me while my will Hath still a man's strength left. I was not thus— I will not think what ever I have been. The worst day lasts no longer than a day, And its worst hour hath but an hour of life Wherein to work us evil. Mary Beaton. Here comes one Hot-spurred with haste and pale with this hour's news: Now shall we know what work it had to do And what the next hour may. Enter George Douglas. George Douglas. The day is lost. There is but one way with us; here we stand As in death's hand already. You must fly, Madam, while time be left or room for flight, As if there be I know not. Fleming. Is the van Broken? George Douglas. Look up where late it stood so fast That wellnigh for an hour the grappling ranks Were so enlinked in front, the men behind That fired across the rank of them before And hurled their pistols in their enemies' face Above their comrades' heads that held the van Saw them yet reeking on the spear-shafts lodged That caught them flatlong fallen athwart the staves Fixed opposite and level, till a shot Slew him that led behind the artillery up As the first round was ended on our part, And straight a gunner's linstock dropped, and gave Fire to the powder-waggon. Maxwell. But the horse— We saw my father's with Lord Seyton's horse Hurl up against the left side round the hill And break their right wing in the rear. George Douglas. Ye saw? But not who brought them rescue, and bore back Your father's force with might and ruin; Grange And Lindsay, with my brother third, who fights With the more bitter heart and hate to-day For our name's sake to purge him of my deed And wreak him on my friends; and would to God, But for the service' sake I had to do, He had met me whom perchance he sought, and slain, Ere I had borne this news out of the fight To bid you fly. Queen. Where will God set mine end? I am wearied of this flying from death to death That is my life, and man's: where'er I go, From God and death I fly not: and even here It may be they must find me. Mary Beaton. Nay, not yet; Take heart again, and fly. Queen. O, this I knew, Even by thine eyes I knew it a great while since As now by mine. Our end of fear is come, That casts out hope as well. Let us make hence. Perchance our help is in Dumbarton yet Upon the rock where I would fain at first Have set my feet; how say you, Fleming, now? May we there make us fast? George Douglas. The ways are thronged With arms and noise of enemies; everywhere The land is full of death and deadly cries From throats that gape for blood; the regent's horse Hold all the highway; and the straiter lanes Stand thick with peasant folk whose hands are armed With staves and sickles in their rage caught up To strike at you for fault of sword or pike Wherewith to charge us flying: no way is left But south to Galloway and Lord Herries' land, Where you may breathe but for a doubtful day In the sea's sight of refuge. Maxwell. In God's name Take his good counsel, madam; as you know The noble Douglas wise and true, believe So shall you find my father's men and mine In this great need. Queen. Come, help me then to horse; If I must ride some hundred miles to breathe, As we must fly no less, I think, or fall Among our foes that follow, in my mind The worst it were not nor the unkindliest death To die in saddle. I will not give again, So please it God, into mine enemies' hands My body up for bondage; twice or thrice I have ridden hard by stars of March or May With false or true men to my left and right The wild night through for death or kingly life, And if I ride now with few friends at hand I have none false of them; or if as once One ride with me that had my hate alive Who rode with me to his own grave, and now Holds me in chase toward mine—O, thou that wast My hate and husband, whom these men to-day Take on them to revenge, and in thy name Turn all men's hearts against me that were born Mine and all swords that served me, if thou be A shadow at hand, a ghost unreconciled, That waits to take his triumph, hear and see If in this hour that smites me, which is thine, Thou find one thought in me that bows my heart, One pang that turns it from the thing it was, One pulse that moves me to repent or fear For what was done or shall be; if thou have But so much power upon me to be called Less hateful or more fearful, and thy death With aught of dread have clothed the thought of thee That thy life had not; if thou seest me fly, Then must thou see too that thou shalt not see In death or life one part of spirit or sense In me that calls thee master. To God's hand I give the rest; but in mine own I hold The perfect power for good or evil days To keep the heart I had, and on myself Lose not one jot of lordship; so may God Love me no less and be no slower, I think, To help my soul than theirs more vile than mine And made for chance to mar, whereon their fate Has power as on their bodies. If he will, Now should he help, or never; for we have A field more fatal to us and day more foul Than ever cast out hope. I am loth to go More than to die; yet come what will soe'er, I shall no more. Thou told'st me not of this, [To Mary Beaton. But yet I learnt it of thee. Come; we have One dark day less of doom to see and live Who have seen this and die not. Stay by me; I know thou wilt; if I should bid thee go, It were but even as if I bade thee stay Who hast as far to flee from death as I. [Exeunt. Scene XII. —Dundrennan Abbey. The Queen and Herries. Queen. Talk not to me of France; this man it was That gave his tongue to serve my kinsmen's plea Who fain had seen me plight at Hamilton To their Arbroath my hand and kingdom; nay, I will not seek my fate at Catherine's hand, Nor on those lips that were my mother's watch My life hang weighed between a word and smile, Nor on that sleek face of the Florentine Read my doom writ, nor in her smooth swart cheek See the blood brighten with desire of mine. I will not live or die upon her tongue Whose hate were glad to give me death or life More hateful from her giving; and I know How she made proffer to my last year's lords To take me from their bondage to her own And shut my days up cloistered; even such love Should France afford me now that in men's sight I stand yet lower, as fallen from this year's hope To live discrowned for ever. Tell him this Who rode with you behind me from the field, And bid him bear his mistress word of me As one that thinks not to be made the mean For them to weave alliance with my foes, And with the purchase of my bartered blood Buy back their power in Scotland. Herries. I shall say it; Yet this man's friendship, madam, might find faith Who by so wild a way has followed you To this third day that sees your flight at end, Where you may sit some forty days secure In trust and guard of mine. Queen. Ay, here I might, Were I well weary with my two nights' sleep On this hard earth that was my naked bed Whom it casts out of kingdom; but, my lord, For thirty leagues and more of ridden ground And two days' fare of peasants' meal and milk I am not yet nigher but by two days to death, Nor spent in spirit for weariness or fear Nor in my body broken, that my need Should hold me here in bonds, or on your faith Lay a new charge of danger. Here, you say, And Beaumont with you, I may bide awhile The levy of my friends whose rallying force May gather to me, or in their default Hence to Dumbarton may I pass by sea Or forth to France with safer sails, and prove What faith is there in friendship. Now my mind Is nowise here to tarry; your true love Shall not for guerdon of its trust and care Be tried again with peril, that as well May be put by for your faith's sake and mine So mutually made much of; nor shall they, Whose wounds run red yet from their regent's hand That on this border laid so sore a scourge As late their blood bore witness, for my sake Or give their blood again or lose their faith That should for me be proven, and being found true Bring them to death should we twice fail, or false Turn their safe life to shame. This shall not be; But I, content to make no trial of these, Will hold them true and leave them unessayed To live in honour. Friends I yet should have Whose peace and life lie not in those men's hands That would make prey of mine; their faith is firm And their hearts great as mine own hope in them Who look toward me from England; all the north No less desires me than I need their love, To lift our creed and cause up that lies low, But wounded not to death. I have their names Who first I think will meet me face to face And lay their loyal hands in mine and pledge Their noble heads for surety; lord and knight Whose fathers yielded up their lives for faith Shall fail not now to seek me cast out hence And gird me fast with all their following round And stalwart musters of their spearmen raised To do me service of stout heart and steel For these lords' sake that call me lady; names That bear the whole might of this northern land Upon their blazon, and the grace and strength Of their old honour with them to that side That they shall serve on; first the two great earls, Then Dacre, Norton, Swinburne, Markinfield, With all their houses, all the border's flower Of ancient faith and fame; had I but these To rise up when I call and do me right I were not poorly friended, with no more Than this for trust to lean on; but I think To find not such friends only as their name And cause should make in danger fast to mine, To link our names in all men's eyes that read Of faith in man for ever; even the queen My sister's self shall fight upon my side, Being either found my friend for whom she swore If I were slain to fill this land with fires, Or casting off my cause and me stand up As much their enemy that partake my faith As mine who lack not friends in all her land That in this cause cast off will strike at her For God's sake on my party. But indeed I look to find not such a foe of her As should have heart or wit to fight with me Though she had will who has not; for her mind Still moving like a blown and barren sea Has yet not ever set so far toward storm Or so much shifted from its natural tide As to seem safe or prosperous for their sails Who traffic for my ruin; and I fear No wind of change that may breathe sharp on me When once I stand in mine own name to speak Before her face and England's. If she will, By her shall I come back to reign her friend; If not by her, then by their loves and hands Who shall put off her sovereignty for mine. There is not and there needs no better way Than here lies fair before my feet, which yet Are not so tired but they may tread it through To the good end. My heart is higher again Than ere that field it was, I know not why, Which sent me hither. You shall write for me Word to the warden of Carlisle, and say Your queen seeks covert for her crownless head With him the first in England; and thereon Ere he send answer or to-morrow set Will I pass over. Herries. I would fain believe His queen were true of heart, and all your friends As strong to serve as faithful; yet may she Have better will than she has power to make, As it would be, your servant; and the land Is many-minded, rent with doubt in twain, And full of fears and factions; you may pass Even in this hope that now builds up your heart To find less help at no less need than here On darker ways and deadlier: yet your will Shall if it hold be done. Queen. Despatch, and write; To stand before the gate of days to be And beat their doors for entrance is more pain Than to pass in and look on life or death. Here will I sleep within your ward to-night, And then no more in Scotland. Nay, make haste; I would those hours were past that hold me here. Scene XIII. —The Shore of Solway Firth. The Queen, Mary Beaton, Herries, George Douglas, Page and Attendants. Queen. Is not the tide yet full? Herries. Come half an hour, And it will turn; but ere that ebb begin, Let me once more desire your pardon, though I plead against your pleasure. Here you stand Not yet dethroned from royal hope, not yet Discrowned of your great name, whose natural power Faith here forgets not, nor man's loyal love Leaves off to honour; but gone hence, your name Is but a stranger's, subject to men's laws, Alien and liable to control and chance That are the lords of exile, and command The days and nights of fugitives; your hope Dies of strange breath or lives between strange lips, And nor your will nor only God's beside Is master of your peace of life, but theirs Who being the lords of land that harbours you Give your life leave to endure their empire: what Can man do to you that a rebel may, Which fear might deem as bad as banishment? Not death, not bonds are bitterer than his day On whom the sun looks forth of a strange sky, Whose thirst drinks water from strange hands, whose lips Eat stranger's bread for hunger; who lies down In a strange dark and sleeps not, and the light Makes his eyes weep for their own morning, seen On hills that helped to make him man, and fields Whose flowers grew round his heart's root; day like night Denies him, and the stars and airs of heaven Are as their eyes and tongues who know him not. Go not to banishment; the world is great, But each has but his own land in the world. There is one bosom that gives each man milk, One country like one mother: none sleeps well Who lies between strange breasts; no lips drink life That seek it from strange fosters. Go not hence; You shall find no man's faith or love on earth Like theirs that here cleave to you. Queen. I have found And think to find no hate of men on earth Like theirs that here beats on me. Hath this earth Which sent me forth a five-years' child, and queen Not even of mine own sorrows, to come back A widowed girl out of the fair warm sun Into the grave's mouth of a dolorous land And life like death's own shadow, that began With three day's darkness—hath this earth of yours That made mine enemies, at whose iron breast They drank the milk of treason—this hard nurse, Whose rocks and storms have reared no violent thing So monstrous as men's angers, whose wild minds Were fed from hers and fashioned—this that bears None but such sons as being my friends are weak, And strong, being most my foes—hath it such grace As I should cling to, or such virtue found In some part of its evil as my heart Should fear, being free, to part from? Have I lived, Since I came here in shadow and storm, three days Out of the storm and shadow? Have I seen Such rest, such hope, such respite from despair, As thralls and prisoners in strong darkness may Before the light look on them? Hath there come One chance on me of comfort, one poor change, One possible content that was not born Of hope to break forth of these bonds, or made Of trust in foreign fortune? Here, I knew, Could never faith nor love nor comfort breed While I sat fast in prison; ye, my friends, The few men and the true men that were mine, What were ye but what I was, and what help Hath each love had of other, yours of mine, Mine of your faith, but change of fight and flight, Fear and vain hope and ruin? Let me go, Who have been but grief and danger to my friends; It may be I shall come with power again To give back all their losses, and build up What for my sake was broken. Herries. Did I know it, Yet were I loth to bid you part, and find What there you go to seek; but knowing it not, My heart sinks in me and my spirit is sick To think how this fair foot once parted hence May rest thus light on Scottish ground no more. Queen. It shall tread heavier when it steps again On earth which now rejects it; I shall live To bruise their heads who wounded me at heel, When I shall set it on their necks. Come, friends, I think the fisher's boat hath hoised up sail That is to bear none but one friend and me: Here must my true men and their queen take leave, And each keep thought of other. My fair page, Before the man's change darken on your chin I may come back to ride with you at rein To a more fortunate field: howe'er that be, Ride you right on with better hap, and live As true to one of merrier days than mine As on that night to Mary once your queen. Douglas, I have not won a word of you; What would you do to have me tarry? George Douglas. Die. Queen. I lack not love it seems then at my last. That word was bitter; yet I blame it not, Who would not have sweet words upon my lips Nor in mine ears at parting. I should go And stand not here as on a stage to play My last part out in Scotland; I have been Too long a queen too little. By my life, I know not what should hold me here or turn My foot back from the boat-side, save the thought How at Lochleven I last set foot aboard, And with what hope, and to what end; and now I pass not out of prison to my friends, But out of all friends' help to banishment. Farewell, Lord Herries. Herries. God go with my queen, And bring her back with better friends than I. Queen. Methinks the sand yet cleaving to my foot Should not with no more words be shaken off Nor this my country from my parting eyes Pass unsaluted; for who knows what year May see us greet hereafter? Yet take heed, Ye that have ears, and hear me; and take note, Ye that have eyes, and see with what last looks Mine own take leave of Scotland; seven years since Did I take leave of my fair land of France, My joyous mother, mother of my joy, Weeping; and now with many a woe between And space of seven years' darkness, I depart From this distempered and unnatural earth That casts me out unmothered, and go forth On this grey sterile bitter gleaming sea With neither tears nor laughter, but a heart That from the softest temper of its blood Is turned to fire and iron. If I live, If God pluck not all hope out of my hand, If aught of all mine prosper, I that go Shall come back to men's ruin, as a flame The wind bears down, that grows against the wind, And grasps it with great hands, and wins its way, And wins its will, and triumphs; so shall I Let loose the fire of all my heart to feed On these that would have quenched it. I will make From sea to sea one furnace of the land Whereon the wind of war shall beat its wings Till they wax faint with hopeless hope of rest, And with one rain of men's rebellious blood Extinguish the red embers. I will leave No living soul of their blaspheming faith Who war with monarchs; God shall see me reign As he shall reign beside me, and his foes Lie at my foot with mine; kingdoms and kings Shall from my heart take spirit, and at my soul Their souls be kindled to devour for prey The people that would make its prey of them And leave God's altar stripped of sacrament As all king's heads of sovereignty, and make Bare as their thrones his temples; I will set Those old things of his holiness on high That are brought low, and break beneath my feet These new things of men's fashion; I will sit And see tears flow from eyes that saw me weep And dust and ashes and the shadow of death Cast from the block beneath the axe that falls On heads that saw me humbled; I will do it, Or bow mine own down to no royal end And give my blood for theirs if God's will be, But come back never as I now go forth With but the hate of men to track my way And not the face of any friend alive. Mary Beaton. But I will never leave you till you die. THE END.</field>
