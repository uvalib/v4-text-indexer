      <field name="fulltext">THE FAWN. A DRAMATIC SCENE. The story of this little Drama is taken, with some variation in the scene and catastrophe, from the beautiful ballad entitled Fause Foodrage, in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Countess Lindorf. Bertha. Leopold. Conrade. Frederick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a Forest in Bohemia;âa Castle in the background.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leopold alone. Leopold. Lie there, dark murderous weapon! I renounce thee! Farewell, ye barbarous sports! Alas, poor fawn! Enter Bertha. Bertha. Did I not hear a gun? The poor, poor fawn Licking its bleeding mother! This is cruel. Leopold. Oh cruel! cowardly! Never againâ I hate my treacherous skill; I hate myself. Bertha. Look how the poor fawn with his nudging nose And pretty stamping feet, dabbled in blood, Tries to awake his dam! How piteously He moans, poor spotted thing! Art thou quite sure The doe is dead? I thought I saw her move. Leopold. Too sure. 'Twas not her motion; that fond thing StrivingâI cannot bear to look on them! She is too surely dead; when I came up I found her dying; her fine delicate limbs Trembling with the death-shiver. She scarce breathed; But the pure instinct of maternal love Struggled to keep in life. She fixed her sad Affectionate eyes upon her young one's face, Then moaning over her as now he moans, Stretched out her feet, and died. Oh, lady Bertha, Man is the wilder brute! Bertha. But thou art grieved And knew'st notâNo, I'm sure thou ne'er didst dream Of this poor fawn? Leopold. No; it lay sleeping there Behind the bushes. But a savage heart Was mine, that could even hereâLook round thee, lady! There is not in the forest such a spot As this. Look how the wood-walks hither tend, As to a centre: some in vistas green, Pillared and overarched, as the long aisles Of an old proud cathedral; others wandering In lovelier mazes through a various scene Holly or copse-wood; scarce the eye can trace Their coy meanders, but all meeting here Beneath this monarch oak, through whose thick boughs The sun comes flickering. How the indented leaves Of brightest green cut clearly the blue sky And the small clouds! And how this tiny spring Bubbles and sparkles round the moss-grown roots, Winding its silver thread along the short Elastic turf, so thickly set with flowers, And mixed with fragrant herbs, till it is lost Amongst the bowery thickets! Not a spot In all the forest can compare with this, Nature's own temple! And that delicate thing Made up of innocence, and love, and fear, And trembling happiness, most beautiful Of all this beauty, she, who stood enjoying, With a sweet peaceful spirit, drinking in This flood of bliss,âthat IâI hate myself! And thou must hate me, lady. Bertha. Oh! no; no; Thou art so sorry! Leopold. 'Tis my father's fault: He keeps me here, waging unequal war With these poor harmless deer, when I should be Armed in the desperate strife, stemming the tide Of glorious battle, winning death or fame. Bertha. That were a strange place to learn gentleness! Leopold. The only place for me. Oh, I must forth Into the stirring world! I have wild dreams Which I would fain make real; daring thoughts Which must be turned to action; hopes which soar High as the eagle's wing; all madness nowâ ButâLady Bertha, I have basked too long In the bright blaze of beauty; I have gazed Unseen, unknown as our poor forest cot Looks upward on thy castle. I must gain A name, or die. A glorious name! Bertha. Nay, Leopoldâ Leopold. She knows me! Bertha. Leopoldâ Leopold. Oh now that name Is precious to my heart! Thou know'st me lady? Bertha. Think'st thou I thus had spoken with a stranger? I've often seen thee at our early mass, And sometimes from the ramparts; and besides My own dear mother oftimes talks of thineâ Her faithful favourite maid. Leopold. She was her maid; Her favourite maid. Oh I had not forgotten. Bertha. And of thy father, her kind faithful friend That old and reverend man, whose shining hairs, Whiter than ermine, so become his bright And healthful cheek. How much I love to see him! How much I wish to know him! My dear mother Talks oftentimes of him. Aye, and of theeâ Oftenest I think of all. Dost thou not know That I'm thy foster-sister? That one breastâ Alas, that breast is cold!ânourished us both? And that we should be friends? Oh I have longed, Even in the holy chapel, to say this; But my stern uncleâ Leopold. Kindest, loveliest maid! How well that heart is mated to that face! And does the gentle Countess speak of meâ That beautiful grief? Yes, I have often seen, Have often felt those dewy eyes where love Mixes with pity as in angel's looks, Fixed upon mine, as she would read my soul. Oh! she would find it full of deep respect For herâand for her daughter. Bertha. Leopold, Look! the poor fawn hath moaned himself to sleep! Give him to me, I, captive though I be, Or little better in those frowning walls, Yet have I there a lone deserted nook Which long neglect hath made a sort of garden; All clothed with moss, and grass, and trailing plants And decked with gorgeous weeds. The wild vine there, And white veined ivy form a natural arbour; And I have mingled odorous shrubs, and sprinkled Bright showers of garden blossoms. It is now A bower fit for the fairies; and unclaimed Of any other I still call it mine; And there my pretty fawn shall dwell with me And feed on roses;âmy poor dappled fawn! No; not in thine arms. Give him into mine. Leopold. Nay, let me carry him! Bertha. Oh! no, no, no; I must not; dare not. Leopold. Only to the gate. Bertha. The gate! Then I must tell my truant tale, Must own my wanderings. First put down the fawn. I know not whyâbut, Leopold, I feel As if I had done wrongâas ifâand yet I'm sure I meant no harm. Let us sit here On these soft mossy roots. It is, indeed, A chosen spot! Well, Leopold, thou know'st That my good father died ere I was born, A luckless girl! and that his castle, lands, Titles and vassals, to his brother fell, And I, amongst the rest, his infant ward. With my dear mother I have lived with him In a most strict seclusionâprisoners In every thing but name! For eighteen years, All my short life, we ne'er have passed the gate. Leopold. Villain! base cowardly villain! Soon a time Shall comeâGo on sweet lady! Bertha. She still mourning Her lord's untimely death; and Iâ Leopold. Oh villain That drink'st the orphan's tears! A time shall comeâ Bertha. Nay, peace; I prythee, peace; I still contentâ Content is not enough!âI still as happy As a young bird. Leopold. Happy! with that fierce tyrant, That stern oppressor! Bertha. He was sometimes kind And my dear mother always. All the house Was good and kind to meâtoo good! too kind! Oh! there is in man's heart a fathomless well Of goodness! I had nought but gratitude, And yet how kind they were! Content and happy Was I; yet sometimes an unbidden thought Sprang upâa hopeâa wishâan earnest wish! A powerful passionate hope! We had a maid Bred in the forest,âa young innocent girl, Who pined for trees, and air, and liberty, Even till she sickened, and her round red cheeks Grew thin and pale; and books, dear books! they all Of freedom spake and nature; and the birds That eddied round our windows, every song Called me to lovely nature; till I longed Intensely, as the schoolboy yearns for home, To cast aside only for once the walls Of our old castle, and to feel green leaves About me, and to breathe the pleasant air, Freshened with wilding flowers and dewy grass And warmed by the bright sun. Leopold. And did the Count Refuse thee, lady? Bertha. Yes. Leopold. But they, his vassals? Surely one only man of all the world Could utter no to thee? Bertha. I asked them not. Have I not said that they were good and kind,â Kindest to me? And could I tempt them on To possible punishment. Leopold. Punished for thee! Oh! what a bliss!âBut thou art here? Bertha. I found The lone deserted court I called my garden, And dressed my bower, and tried to trifle thus My bootless wish away:âBut still it clung! And one day following, with my eye, my heart, A ring-dove hastening to her woodland nest, Wishing I too had wings, I marked how low In that dark angle was the ruined wall, Covered with clustering ivy and o'erhung By an old ash. And almost with the thought, The ivy boughs my ladder, and the ash My friendly veil, I climbed the wall and came Down on the other side, a safe descent, Propped by the uneven trunk;âand there I stood Panting with fear and joy at liberty! Yet was I so o'ermastered by my fear, That for that day I could not move a step Into the forest; but crept trembling backâ And wept as if for grief. Often since then, When the Count Lindorf is abroad, as now That he lies sick at Prague, I venture forth As fearless as a dove. Leopold. And still unmarked? Bertha. The sheltering forest reaches to the wallâ Look, 'tis close by!âI never have seen trace Of man but once; then thou wast reading here: I had resolved if ever I should meet Thee, or thy good old father, to accost ye; Yet when I saw thee hereâI know not howâ But my heart failed me, and I fled. I wonder At to-day's courage; but the poor, poor fawnâ I only thought of him. Well, I must hence; My mother else may miss me. Leopold. Then the Countess Knows not this path? Bertha. No; her sweet gentle spirit Is cast in a too anxious mould; she fears For all she loves. No; I have never told her. But now that weâand she must see my fawn! Ayeâand she ought to know. Leopold. And when she knowsâ Oh, lady, I shall never see thee more! Bertha. Yet I must tell herâSurely I must tell her! She is my own most dear and loving mother:â Ought I not, Leopold? Leopold. Lady thou should'st; Though it will root from out my heart a hope Deeper than life; thou should'st. Bertha. Give me the fawn! And, Leopold, stay here. I thinkâI hope That she will wish to see thee. If she shouldâ Come not with me. Be sure to stay just here. Farewell!âNay, struggle not, my pretty fawn! Thou must along with me.âFarewell! [Exit Bertha. Leopold. Farewell, Loveliest and most beloved! Well might she wish To tread the woodland path,âlight-footed maid! How beautiful she is, with her white arms Wound round her innocent burthen, and her head Bent over his so lullingly! Even he, That wild and timorous creature, feels the charm, And is no more afraid. She disappears;â I scarce distinguish now her floating veil And her brown waving hair. How beautiful! How graceful! Most like one of Dian's nymphs But full of deeper tenderness. Her voice, Her words still linger round me like the air, The dewy sunny air of which she spake, Glowing and odorous. Oh! that I wereâ And I will be. Yes, loveliest, most beloved, I will deserve thee! I will make my name, My humble lowly name, worthy to join With thine, sweet Lady Bertha!âHapless thing, Thy gay compeers may bound at peace for me; I shall seek braver fields. For thee, poor doe, I will go bury thee deep in yon dell. Should she return,âand will she then return? How my heart throbs to know. Enter Conrade. Conrade. Surely I saw Some bright and lovely maiden flitting by Close to the castle wall. Along this path She must have come. Or was it but the vision That fills my dreams by night, my thoughts by day, The bright and lovely form?âHa, Leopold! Hast thou seen here a woman, a fair woman? Leopold. She has just parted hence, the Lady Bertha. Conrade. Bertha! Oh I must see, must follow her! Leopold. Nay, 'tis too late. Ere now she's in the Castle. She will return. Conrade. Oh, wondrous, wondrous chance! The Lady Bertha!âDid she speak to thee? What seems she, Leopold? Gay, gentle, kind, Her mother was. Oh, tell me of her, boy! Leopold. Father, I must to the wars. Conrade. Tell me of her! Leopold. I must go win a name. Conrade. Well! Well! thou shalt. Talk to me now of Bertha! Leopold. This is Bertha! Why war and fame and life they are all Bertha! Nothing but Bertha!âOh, I love her, father, Madly and wildly. She is my whole world, Rip up my heart and you will find all Bertha; And I will wed her. I must to the wars And earn her love. Nay, shake not thus thy head. Though she be great and I be lowly, father, I tell thee I will make a glorious name, Or die. Conrade. This is most wondrous. But the Countâ Count Lindorf? Leopold. Oh! true love is strong and mighty; Pride bends before it. Conrade. Were it pride alone! Count Lindorf, as I hear, would rather see The Lady Bertha in a convent cell Than wedded. He is dark and dangerous, And full of fears. Men sayâ Leopold. Speak on, speak on. What say they, father? Conrade. Dark and dangerous A fierce and gloomyâNay, no more of this. Whither dost drag that doe? Leopold. To bury it Far from her sight; she will be here anon. She fain would know thee, and she speaks of thee So reverently! In truth she is as humble As a poor village maiden; yet as gracious As a born princess. I shall soon return. Stay, dearest father, lest she come the while; She fain would see thee. [Exit Leopold. Conrade. Oh if she could know, Could feel, could shareâBe still, my beating heart! Thou shalt not master me, be still!âShe comes, The beautiful! the kind!âOh, that I daredâ Enter Countess Lindorf and Bertha. Bertha. This is the spot I'm sure; but where is he? Conrade. These are the first words I have heard her speak In all my life! How mine ear drinks her voice! The Countess too! Countess. Conrade, my kindest friend! My faithfullest! my best! How many cares Have made me old since in thy parting tears I said Farewell to truth and honesty! Conrade. My gracious lady! Countess. Conrade, where is he? Conrade. In yonder dell. She hath caught sight of him. Bertha. Ah, there he is burying the poor, poor doe! I must go help him. Countess. First come hither, Bertha. This is my faithful friendâ Bertha. Leopold's father, I know him well. He is no stranger, mother: Why I have love him ever since I saw Those reverend hairs; and he I'm sure loves me. Dost thou not, Conrade? See, he looks at me With such a kindly gaze. Conrade. How beautiful She is! What a bright smile lives in her eyes! And see! her soft white hand is dimpled o'er Like a young babe's. Oh, take it not away, That soft and dimpled hand! Countess. No, rather give Both hands, my Bertha. He's thy foster father. Bertha. May I not call him father? I, alas! Have never known one. Conrade. Blessings on thy head, Beloved child! Countess. Now, my own Bertha, go And seek young Leopold, and bring him hither. Nay, let her go!â [Exit Bertha. Yes, Conrade, she is more Than thy heart paints her: through these long, long years My only comfort. She is all made up Of sweet serene content; a buoyant spirit That is its own pure happiness. If e'er Count Lindorf chide herâand, in sooth, even he Can scarcely find a fault to blame in Berthaâ But should he chide her, she will meekly bend For one short moment, then rise smiling up, As the elastic moss when trampled on By some rude peasant's foot. Never was heart Stronger than her's in peaceful innocence. Now speak of him. Conrade. First, Madam, he loves her. I knew it but to-day. Countess. So! She loves him, And knows it not. But tell me of his temper. Conrade. Kind, noble, generous, but all too hot: Just like those bright black eyes, whose fiery flash Kindling with living light, I've seen thee watch With such a painful joy. Countess. I have gazed on him Till my eyes ached, till every sense was dazzled. Yet with that fire there was a gentleness, A softer, tenderer look. And still he knows notâ Conrade. I dare not trust him, lady. He already Abhors Count Lindorf; he already longs For war, for danger, for renown, for aught That at the risk of life or limb may win A name, a noble name. Countess. A noble name! He pants for that! And I, that with a wordâ Oh, may I? dare I? Conrade. Noble lady, no. The Count is dangerous, and this rash youthâ Countess. True; true. And I expect my powerful kinsman The Baron Zutphen; he shall hear my story, My sad, sad story, Conrade. Oh, the strife Of love so long pent in, so strong, so deep, So gushing through the heart with bitter fear! And I that ne'er have known the dear delight To give him pleasureâOh, to think that I Could with a word, one wordâI must away; I dare not trust myself. Good Conrade help me Back to the Castle. Conrade. Rest thee here awhile, Dear lady!âHow she trembles!âNay, sit down: Command thyself. Re-enter Leopold and Bertha. Bertha. Mother! Countess. Who called me mother? Leopold. Let me support her. Lady, lean on me. Countess. His very tone! Bertha. How art thou, deares mother? Countess. Better. Bertha. But still thou tremblest, and so pale! Leopold. Oh, do not rise. Thou art too weak! Countess. A strong And a kind arm supports me. Leopold. Never, Madam, Was it so honoured. Would that all my life Might pass as this brief moment! Countess. Leopold I think. Leopold. And for my father's sake, perhapsâ Countess. Thy father! Aye indeed thy father! Leopold, I have a boon to ask of thee. Leopold. A boon! Say, Madam, a command. Countess. Well! a command. Conrade hath told me thou wilt to the wars; I have a powerful kinsman, young and brave, High in the Emperor's favour; I expect him At Lindorf in the autumn. Be content To wait his coming, and my first request Shall be that he will guide thee in that path Of stainless honour which himself hath trod. Say, wilt thou wait till then? Leopold. How can poor Leopold, The humble lowborn Leopold, deserve This wondrous bounty! Not for the wide world, Not even for her would I deceive such goodness. Madam, all poor and lowly as I am, Yet I have dared to loveâOh pardon me! Even if thou banish, pardon!âWho could see Thy Bertha and not love her? Countess. And what says My Bertha to such love? Bertha. My dearest mother, What is that proud word rank? What hath it been But the stern prison-bolt that barred me out From air, and sunshine, and the song of birds, And the sweet scent of flowers? And must it now Excludeâ Enter Frederick. Frederick. Thank Heaven she's found! I have sought thee, Madam, Every where vainly. I have that to tell Which may not brook delay. Countess. Is the Count Lindorf Returned? Frederick. My gracious lady, he is dead. Conrade. Dead! Frederick. Even so. Last night Count Lindorf died. Countess. No, no, he lives! the real Count Lindorf lives! My son! my son! my own, my very son! Thou for whose sake I have endured to live In prison and in sorrowâthou art mine, My Leopold! In the face of all the world I will proclaim thee rightful Count of Lindorf. Leopold. Mother! I do not ask if this be real, My heart hath always claimed thee. Yes; I am Thy son, thy very son. Bertha. And the poor Berthaâ What then is she? Countess. My daughter, still my daughter. Leopold. Bertha my sister? Countess. No; thy wife. Will that Please thee as well? And our dear Conrade's child. Conrade. My own sweet child! Countess. My son, thy speaking eyes Demand my story. Briefly let me tell A grief which eighteen years have left as fresh As yesterday. Thy father was a man Born to lead all hearts captive. Such he was As thou art now. Look at the features, Frederickâ The shape, the air. Frederick. It is his very self. Countess. I loved himâwe were in our bridal yearâ Oh how I loved him! So did all the world Except his envious brother. They went forth Together, at the break of day, to hunt Here in this very forest; and at eve Oneâonly oneâreturned. MineâmineâO God! The agony, the frightful agony When he at last was broughtâO God! Leopold. My mother! Countess. Some tale was told of direful accidentâ Would that I could believe! But from that hour Peace, rest, and appetite and natural smiles Forsook the conscious fratricideâOh guilt Hath well avenged us! But, ere yet the flush Of bold triumphant crime had paled to fear, And dark remorse, did Conrade overhearâ For I was great of thee, my Leopold, And grief and horror had brought on my pains,â This Lindorf bribe a ruffian to secure My infant, if a male. Thou, sweetest Bertha, A new-born innocent babe wast in the castle; And he, and my kind nurse, and she the kindest And faithfullest of all, thy blessed mother, Contrived, I scarcely conscious, to exchange My boy for his fair girl.âA boundless debt We owe thee, Conrade. Conrade. Pay it to my Bertha. Leopold. She is herself that debt! What was the life Of fifty such as I, compared to Bertha? A paltry boon, scarce worth my thanks, dear father! She is the treasure! Sheâ Bertha. Cease, flatterer, cease! I must go tend my fawn. Countess. My son, I long To see thee in thy castle. Frederick. Ye will find The Baron Zutphen there to greet ye, Madam. He came to proffer succour and protection To thee and Lady Bertha; he will now Welcome his brave young kinsman. Not a heart, Vassal or servant but will feel the joy Of this discovery. Countess. Leopold, my sonâ How proud I am of that unwonted word! Let us go meet the Baron. Bertha, Conrade, Daughter and friend, come with me; this kind cousin Must see how rich I am! Mine own dear son!</field>
