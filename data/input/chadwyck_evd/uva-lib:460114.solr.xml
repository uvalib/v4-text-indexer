      <field name="fulltext">A HINT TO HUSBANDS: A COMEDY, IN FIVE ACTS,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE READER. The favourable manner in which the Town was pleased to receive this Comedy, has encouraged me to commit it to the Press, and to lay it before the Reader divested of those aids, which were probably its best recommendation to the spectator. In its pilgrimage to the Stage, it has encountered some adventures, which I could not relate with pleasure; and others, which I cannot consistently with gratitude pass over in silence. It was written under the auspices of Mr. Graham, and cast for the performers of Drury Lane Theatre. I clearly understood it to be positively accepted for immediate representation, till a short note from that gentleman informed me, âthat a material change in the property of Drury Lane Theatre had taken place, and that all thoughts of my Comedy for the present season were given up.â As I knew not where to look for that material change to which Mr. Graham alludes, I received it in silent submission as the pass-word for my discharge; and tendered my Play to Mr. Harris, in whose word there is no change. His candour disdained to find any motives for the rejection of my manuscript, except what his judgement might suggest upon the perusal of it; and when he had accepted it, I am certain that no precedent whatever could have tempted him to find a plea for returning it upon my hands. For many of the defects, which I do not doubt that Mr. Graham's sagacity discovered in my composition, the friendly zeal and judgement of Mr. Harris suggested remedies, and prescribed amendments. I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to mark my obligations to him, and pay to him my sincerest thanks,â not only because they are justly due, but because I think it a duty which I owe to my brethren of the Drama, to add my instance to the numbers upon record of the liberality and honour of that gentleman, who has for so long a period conducted the interests of the Theatre he directs, with an unquestioned character for generosity to Authors and good faith in his engagements. To the rehearsals of this Play Mr. Kemble, as Manager, paid an unremitted attention. To him, therefore, and to the Performers, I beg leave to return my most cordial acknowledgements. I wrote the part of the Irishman expressly for Mr. Johnstone of Drury Lane Theatre, whose abilities in that cast of acting are of unrivalled excellence. It was with difficulty that Mr. Blanchard could be persuaded to undertake a character so entirely new to him, and attempt a dialect to which he had never accustomed himself. I am therefore in a peculiar manner bound to pay my thanks to that modest and meritorious actor; and had our public papers vented all their spleen and ill-nature upon me, and spared him, there would have been less injustice in their dealings: for I am fair game, as a voluntary offenderâHe is not. I am going out of their reach, and shall soon receive my lasting respite from their ceaseless persecution. This, although I feel and suffer by as an author, I can overlook and pardon as a gentleman; because my heart assures me, that having written more for the Stage than any one of my nation ever did, I have constantly studied the propriety of that Stage, nor ever aimed to catch applause by those arts which are a disgrace to it. I have been consistent in opposing myself to the eccentricities of the modern Drama. These diurnal Critics have professed to think with me, and combined to act against me: but there are understandings which they cannot influence; and times, to which I appeal, when they will be no longer remembered. RICHARD CUMBERLAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Written by Sir James Bland Burgess, Bart. If yet a play, by pageantry ungrac'd, In its plain dress can suit the public taste, Our bard, perhaps, may venture to appeal, From those who only gaze, to those who feel. Bred in the old and half-forgotten school, He does not quite renounce the Drama's rule; He boasts no pantomimic skill, nor tries To make his audience hear him with their eyes: Whilst Nature prompts, his moral scene imparts And speaks some honest truths to British hearts. The first, the noblest purpose of the Stage, Is to reflect the manners of the age; By fair example, folly to reclaim; To guide the thoughtless, and the base to shame. Experience proves, that many, who refuse Cold Caution's precepts, listen to the Muse; That many a heart, in Fashion's vortex caught, By her to calm reflection has been brought. If such success our Author should attend; Should he instruction with amusement blend; Should from his scene one thoughtless Husband learn A Wife's neglected merit to discern; Or, when temptation revels in his soul, Derive an aid, rash passion to control; Your gen'rous sanction will applaud his art, Confirm'd, enhanc'd, by conscience and the heart.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âA Library. Lord Transit is discovered. He rises and advances. LORD TRANSIT. Sated with guilty pleasures, which had sapp'd My health, my fortune, and my peace of mind, I took an humble unspoilt girl to wife; And here I hop'd with her, and with my books, Which taste and education had endear'd, To lead a calm, sequester'd, virtuous life; Her mind was ductile, and her genius seiz'd With apt advantage what my lessons taught. The task was charming: but I soon perceiv'd It was the charm of novelty; each day Took something from it, every month impair'd, A year extinguish'd it; and now the world Spreads all its gaudy colours in my view, Whilst virtue, like a shadow, fades away. Lady Transit enters. LADY TRANSIT. May I come in? No answerâThat means yes, Does it not? Still no answerâThat's consent Seal'd with a double silenceâAh, my lord, My dear Lord Transit, now your humble scholar Is become gay and happy, you are silent, Grave, and reserv'd. That is not as it shou'd be. LORD TRANSIT. Come, come, no trifling. You and I have pass'd Some hours of late, which make it much too clear That these fond levities are out of place. LADY TRANSIT. Oh, if you think you've set me up too high, Pray take me down againâdown to the groundâ I hope that reverence is profound enough. [Curtsies very low. LORD TRANSIT. You're spoilt, you're spoilt.âThese mockeries disgust; They don't become you. LADY TRANSIT. Nor do those cross looks, And proud rebuffs, my lord, sit well on you, Or any one that has a manly feeling For a defenceless, unoffending woman. LORD TRANSIT. Go, go, I've done with you. I dreamt of happiness: I have it notâI am a wretched man. LADY TRANSIT. You make yourself a wretched man, my lord. LORD TRANSIT. Yes, I am marriedâSo far, it is true, I am a wretched man of my own making. And yet, take notice, I will own to faults; Aye, faults by thousands, undomestic humours, Wandering desiresâ LADY TRANSIT. Do I reproach you with them? LORD TRANSIT. No, no, not much; but tacitly enough To make me urge this question on myselfâ Why did I marry you? Can you resolve it? LADY TRANSIT. Nay, I can't tell,âunless it was in kindness, To love me, to inform me of your pleasure, And teach me how to please you. LORD TRANSIT. Either I Have fail'd to teach, or you to learn, that art. No more of this! You answer like a child. LADY TRANSIT. When you, my lord, forget to be a man, 'Tis well that I, with all a woman's feelings, Can answer like a child. I have told you What shou'd have been the motives for your marriage: Now, if you're not asham'd of the confession, You may inform me what those motives were. LORD TRANSIT. You're lively, madam, and retort upon me; And when the creature, I have rais'd, does that, This is my only answerâWe must partâ You must go to your father. LADY TRANSIT. Must, my lord! Who but the husband must maintain the wife While she is honest? Must go to my father! LORD TRANSIT. Aye, madam, 'tis my pleasure. LADY TRANSIT. Hold, my lord: Your pleasure, that is absolute with me, May not be such with him. I would not wish you So to mistake my father, as to think him Less than your equal in the quickest sense Of any insult, that shall touch his honour. LORD TRANSIT. Oh, if he feels so finely, I must think To send him a right honourable daughter Is the best compliment that I can pay him. I took you as the veriest child of poverty; I send you back appointed as my wife, Ennobled, and enrich'd. Of what can he, Or you, or any of your kin complain? Farewell! You'll be provided for your journey. LADY TRANSIT. Farewell, my lord! I'm ready for my journey. [Exit. LORD TRANSIT. I do her wrongâby Heaven I do her wrong! Well, well, well, well! I must not think about it. The man, who hurries on as passion drives, Must never put this question to his conscience, Where am I going, or why go at all?â Pass on, pass on; take your own way with me, Dame Nature; on my conscience I believe Where you lead one man right you puzzle thousands. Where are my people? Here! who waits? Dogherty enters. DOGHERTY. Myself. What is your lordship's pleasure to be wanting? LORD TRANSIT. My pleasure does not centre in my wants; Take that for granted. Let my chaise be ready. DOGHERTY. Oh, never fear the chaise; I'll answer for it; I am not quite so sure about the horses. LORD TRANSIT. Sirrah, your quibbling sometimes may amuse, Here it is out of place. Away, begone! Servant enters. SERVANT. Your lordship's equipage is at the door. [Exit Servant. DOGHERTY. There now, he speaks as a good servant shou'd; I'm but a quibbling blockhead, an old fool, A worn-out piece of lumberâThrow me by: I'm good for nothing. LORD TRANSIT. Listen, and don't talk. I'm setting off for town:âwhen I am gone, I shall keep no establishment at the castle. DOGHERTY. What will my lady do? LORD TRANSIT. Go to her father. I've order'd her away. DOGHERTY. What! then 'tis clear You will keep no establishment at the castle; For, by my faith, all that she don't take with her, Will take themselves away. LORD TRANSIT. And you amongst them, If your long service hangs so light upon you. Go where you will, or go with herâI care not. DOGHERTY. With her, so please your lordship; for I'm sure That Heav'n's good providence will still be with her; And I shall be right glad to take my chance For making one in such good company. LORD TRANSIT. I do believe you've made the wiser choice. The dye is castâCommend me to your lady. [Exit. DOGHERTY. Commend you! Troth, there's little to commend In or about you. You have had a taste Of peace and purity; if that don't serve, 'Faith, you must e'en take up with dirty company, And dirty dishes of the devil's providing. Mrs. Ruth enters. RUTH. Oh Tim! DOGHERTY. Stop there,âTimotheus is my name, Timotheus DoghertyâI would avoid Too much familiarty with the wicked. RUTH. Do you call me the wicked? Give that name To your own lord; he merits it most richly For his base treatment of the best of ladies. Ah! Mr. Dogherty, would you believe it? He 'as turn'd her off, and sent her to her father. DOGHERTY. Yes, and there's one will send him to his father: Make yourself sure of that. RUTH. Well, for my part, The sooner we are out of this bad house The better. DOGHERTY. Right! it is an ugly house, And, when your lady goes, the devil may enter: I'll not be one to stop him. RUTH. So say I. Would you were going with usâWou'd you were! DOGHERTY. You're a good creature, are you not, to wish it? Now I should guess, by the short time you spare For conversation, you're extremely hurried. RUTH. Oh yes, I'm packing up my lady's things As fast as possible. DOGHERTY. I see you are; But at the pace you go 'twill soon be done: And when you've pack'd your lady, Mrs. Ruth, Look out a tight portmanteau for my rags, And thrust 'em in, d'ye mind meâneatly now By neck and shoulders, as you do your own. RUTH. You're going with us? DOGHERTY. You may say all that. RUTH. Oh, I'm so happyâand so very busyâ And here's the coachmanâHe'll be bawling out For trunks and bandboxes, and all the while I'm slaving, as you see, to get things ready. [Exit. Coachman enters. DOGHERTY. So, honest Joe! you are like Mrs. Ruth, Slaving and toiling to get all things ready For your good lady's going. COACHMAN. Master Dogherty, 'Tis a foul job;âI say it, and don't care Who hears meâand, what's more, I am the man That will not eat the bread of any master Who wrongs so good a lady. DOGHERTY. Why, that's honest. But servants must not talk. COACHMAN. Well! they can feel. DOGHERTY. Why, so they can, and so can horses too: Now recollect that, Joe, when next you drive. Here comes my ladyâGo, go, get you gone! [Exit Joe. Lady Transit enters. LADY TRANSIT. So, friend! it seems that you and I must part. DOGHERTY. Not soâI'm going by my lord's commands To pay my duty to you at your father's; And, as I know no one step of the road, I'm thinking, after all, that to go with you Will be the readiest way to meet you there. LADY TRANSIT. Did my Lord Transit recommend this to you? DOGHERTY. Yes; and what's more, I recommended it To my own self. That makes the business easy. LADY TRANSIT. My lord is kind in sparing me a servant Of such tried honesty. DOGHERTY. I have all that. A willing mindâI boast of nothing else. LADY TRANSIT. You will repent of it. My father's house Is not like this great castle. DOGHERTY. I believe it: Less in its bulk, but bigger in content. LADY TRANSIT. Make yourself ready for the journey thenâ With my lord's leave I do accept your service. DOGHERTY. Oh then, I'll go and saddle old blind Bob; He never starts, he only tumbles down. All our hacks else do both. I despise pomp; And study nothing but my ease and safety. [Exit. Servant enters. SERVANT. Sir Charles Le Brun, to wait upon your ladyship. LADY TRANSIT. Sir Charles must pardon meâI see no visitors. SERVANT. He bade me say he had a message for you Of much importance. LADY TRANSIT. From my lord, perhaps. Admit Sir Charles. [Exit Servant. A high-flown gentleman, Blest with the most high-flying wife in England. Sir Charles Le Brun enters. SIR CHARLES. Ah, I was sure my goddess would not turn The humblest of her votaries from her door. LADY TRANSIT. Well, you are not turn'd from my door, you see. Now, then, lay by your stilts, and tell me plainly, As suits an humble mortal, and no goddess, What is your business. Have you any message From my lord to me? SIR CHARLES. Oh! don't name him to me. Transit has lost me quite. I can't speak of him With common patience. What! forsake an angel, The brightest effort of creative nature! Why, Paradise could not content that fellow. LADY TRANSIT. Come, come, your business. SIR CHARLES. What I hear is shocking. You're going to your father. LADY TRANSIT. Does that shock you? SIR CHARLES. Unspeakablyâthe very surest course To slur the credit of the purest fame. A father's house is, in the world's construction, The last sad refuge for a ruin'd daughter. If you fly thither, either you must prove In public court your husband's brutal treatment, Or else submit, and leave the world to put Their own interpretation on the measureâ Which Heaven forbid! LADY TRANSIT. It may be as you state; But I have not another friend on earth, To whom I can resort. SIR CHARLES. Ah! say not so! You have a friend, a tender, feeling friend, Pure, spotless as yourself. She sends me to you; She begs you, as you prize your fame, to make Her house, her heart, her honour, your asylum. LADY TRANSIT. And she isâwho? SIR CHARLES. My wife. LADY TRANSIT. Lady Le Brun! Nay now, my good Sir Charles, you must excuse me, You certainly say this by way of jest; I'm sure you do. I hardly know your lady To curtsey to her. Recollect withal, How should your lady, who is now in Town, Know an event, which only came to pass Within this hour? SIR CHARLES. Why, that's a natural question: It struck me you would ask it. LADY TRANSIT. I dare sayâ It don't strike me that you will answer it. SIR CHARLES. Have patience, goddess! I foresaw your danger, And I appris'd my wife. LADY TRANSIT. Did you? It shows How cautiously you guard my reputation: And how munificent! to make your house A hospital for unprotected wives, And be the keeper of their consciencesâ Heavens! what a blest assembly will that be! Of rival goddesses, and you the Paris To keep us all in humour! SIR CHARLES. Nay, but hear me! If you turn friendship into jest, I've done. That any man can be insensible To Lady Transit's charms, is out of nature: If I should boast myself to be that man, It were a lying boast.âMy greatest pride Will be, to guard those charms that I admire, And, by convincing a censorious world That you are not less virtuous than fair, Bar those suspicions that may else attach To your unsullied fame. LADY TRANSIT. I rather doubt, My good Sir Charles, if you are quite the man For such an office. SIR CHARLES. Can you doubt my honour? LADY TRANSIT. Oh, not your honourânobody doubts thatâ But very many people would doubt mine, If I should make that transfer of myself Which you advise. But let me see your ordersâ Show me your lady's letter. SIR CHARLES. Be content: I have it not about me. LADY TRANSIT. Search your pockets. SIR CHARLES. I never carry letters in my pockets. LADY TRANSIT. Oh yes, on such occasions, when you come Express on a commission, you would bring it. SIR CHARLES. Now why should you desire to see a letter Which 'tis so natural for a man to burn As soon as he has read it?âA mere start Of fond effusion from a doting wife To a devoted husband. LADY TRANSIT. Ah, that's true, That's very true:âYou are so fond a husband, And your dear lady such a darling wife;â Upon my word, Sir Charles, I will not be Your goddess any longerânot, at least, Your household goddess. There you must excuse me; And so, good morning! When I see your lady I'll pay my thanks to her. [Exit. SIR CHARLES. The vengeance! will you? That will be perfectly mal-Ã -propos. Confound her cunning! she has found me out: She's not that soft submissive thing I thought her. Transit, methinks, may have some other cause Than mere caprice for acting as he does; Therefore, I'll not despair, but still pursue:â For where the husband's harsh neglect is felt The lover's assiduity may triumph. [Exit. SCENE II. âAn Apartment in the Castle. Servant enters followed by Trevor. SERVANT. My lady, sir, can see no company. TREVOR. I am no companyâI am her cousin; Her father's nephew. SERVANT. May I beg your name? TREVOR. My name is Trevor. SERVANT. Here my lady comes. [Exit Servant. Lady Transit enters. LADY TRANSIT. Ah! is it you? Why do you stand aloof? Give me your hand, George! We have been old friends And play-fellows.âDon't think I can forget you! TREVOR. Oh! had I found that lovely nature chang'dâ Had you received me haughtily, I think It would have broke my heart. LADY TRANSIT. Why shou'd you doubt me? But I am all impatience for your news. Is my dear father well? TREVOR. In health most perfect, In manner not less rugged than he was. LADY TRANSIT. Well, well, we know his humour, and his heart. TREVOR. I have a letter from him to your lord; I think I cross'd upon him at the door. LADY TRANSIT. 'Twas not my lord: it was Sir Charles Le Brun. TREVOR. I'm glad I pass'd him. Where shall I deliver This packet I am charg'd with? LADY TRANSIT. Give it me. My lord is not at home. Do you suppose That I may read it? TREVOR. I am sure you may. LADY TRANSIT. 'Tis not my father's hand. TREVOR. His lawyer wrote it; He set his name to it. So, that's enough. Read, read it! The contents will not displease you. LADY TRANSIT. [reads] âMy Lord!âA considerable property having fallen to me unexpectedly, I must desire you will permit my daughter to come to me in London without delay, having business to adjust, in which she, as my only child, is materially interested. âI am, my Lord, your very humble servant, âPhilip Fairford. P. S. âI have sent my nephew with this letter, who will conduct her to my house in the City.â TREVOR. Yes; that's all true: it is a princely fortune. Old Gallishoff, the Russian merchant, will'd it To your good fatherâand your father earn'd it; Got him a world of money; made four voyages To RussiaâI was with him on the last. You married in his absenceâI must tell you It did not please him; but you'll find a pardon. LADY TRANSIT. When such good fortune falls upon my family I must not murmur. TREVOR. Rather say you will not; And true it is, you need not; for I trace The fountains of affliction in those eyes, Whose mute expression words could never mend. Ah, my Louisa!âlet me still address you By that dear nameâI know you are unhappy. LADY TRANSIT. How can you know that? Since I was a wife We've never met. TREVOR. Think not, because I'm banish'd From these proud doors, which have denied access E'en to your father, that no voice hath told A tale of secret sorrows in my ear: Yes; I have heard themâfelt them. LADY TRANSIT. Stop, my friend: If I have sorrows, they shall be my own; If I am arm'd in innocence, and clear And bold in conscience, I want no defender. TREVOR. Well, if that day shall come, and I am living, You will remember that there is a creature Who lov'd you as a brother;âhow much better Is not for me to say. LADY TRANSIT. Doubt me not, George! 'Tis not a title can estrange my mind From its remembrance of those happy days, When kindred nature twin'd our hearts together. But 'tis not now of moment to look back And dwell on scenes like these. I must depart. My lord's command confirms my father's call; I scarce can bid you welcome to the castle: So instant we must be upon our journey. TREVOR. I may attend upon youâ? LADY TRANSIT. Oh, no doubt; My father sent you hither for that purpose: You'll be my sole companion; I shall take No equipage of Lord Transit's, and one servant Of either sex; no more. TREVOR. Can you be serious? This is not going as becomes your rank. LADY TRANSIT. If it becomes my duty so to go, I'll ask no leave of rank, but go without it; And when you find me slighted and forsaken By him whose wife I am, make no appeal, But let him go, till conscience in his heart Shall fix that hook by which to draw him back To his domestic peace; for sure the fruits Of virtue are not of that tasteless sort, That the pall'd appetite should feel disgust At her pure regimen, and turn aside To snatch at pleasures, by experience found Productive only of remorse and shame. [Exeunt. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âLondon.âAn apartment in Lord Transit's house. Lord Transit, Pliant, Sir Harry Sumner, and Hardiman. Heartright follows, sits down to a table in the back scene, takes up a newspaper and reads. PLIANT. Your lordship comes amongst us in good time; A little more philosophy had marr'd you. LORD TRANSIT. Well, spare your railleryâit is confest We country-people do but crawl through life: The world, I see, gallops apace with you; 'Tis a free tit, my masters, and you ride As if you meant to make it a short race. PLIANT. Yes, we go off at score, and trust to bottom. LORD TRANSIT. You're men of penetration, I perceive, And calculate most truly of yourselves. You are not of the sort that carry weight; Mere feathers in the scale. PLIANT. We have no wives; We don't ride double, as your lordship does. SIR HARRY. Come, Pliant, Pliant, you have got your charge; Keep your pan down, nor let your priming flash. LORD TRANSIT. Oh! stop him not.âHe is exceeding pleasant; There is much argument in his discourse; For what escapes so fast as pleasure does? And wou'd not you, who chase it, be thrown out, If you pull'd up for breath? PLIANT. Truly, my lord, We do not often stop to moralise, And make profound remarks upon the practice Of other men, as you make upon ours. LORD TRANSIT. It speaks well for your candour, worthy sir; And by the same rule I must plead my humour For having married, though you all prefer A life of singleness and liberty. SIR HARRY. Come, gentlemen, we'll drop these disquisitions. HEARTRIGHT. And you'll do well; for you have much more wine Than wisdom in your heads. [sitting at the table.] SIR HARRY. And now, my lord, What kind of neighbours have you in the Country? LORD TRANSIT. But few, Sir Harry; and of those, perhaps, The only man you know is Charles Le Brun. PLIANT. He is a damn'd honest fellow. LORD TRANSIT. I shou'd doubt If he has honesty enough to damn him. PLIANT. You can speak well of no man. LORD TRANSIT. Yes, of him: For, with your leave, I hold it worth some praise âTo affect a virtue, though you have it not.â That merit I allow him. PLIANT. He's my friend. LORD TRANSIT. Well, if you choose your friend shou'd be a saint, He can be one, whene'er it suits his purpose. I hope that satisfies you, Mr. Pliant. PLIANT. Not at all satisfies me, not at all: I must insist upon it with my lord, My friend Sir Charles Le Brun shall have all dues, Rights and prerogatives, pertaining to him,â That he's no saint, that he has not a virtue, But all those graceful eccentricities, Those high-bred aberrations from decorum, That sit so well upon a fort-esprit, And (what I style him) a damn'd honest fellow. HARDIMAN. Come, pr'ythee, Pliant, let us have no more. Sir Harry, let us wish my lord good night. LORD TRANSIT. Who waits? Attend upon the gentlemen. PLIANT. I satisfied! I'm any thing but that. [Exeunt Pliant, Sir Harry, and Hardiman.â Manent Lord Transit and Heartright. Heartright rises and speaks. HEARTRIGHT. So! these are the agreeable companions For whose society you have renounc'd Tedious tranquillity, and those dull virtues That want the zest of vice to recommend them. I think this specimen may be enough To recreate your genius with a taste Of those soft pleasures which this Town supplies. LORD TRANSIT. I see you hold by your old humour still; Bitter and blunt as ever. HEARTRIGHT. Yes: I see No cause to sweeten my morality To the pall'd palate of a libertine. For you, my lord, whom I have train'd at school, At university, abroad, at home, Ever your friend, I'm not dispos'd to smooth My bluntness down to such a silvery edge As cannot penetrate the steel, in which That heart is cas'd, which can revolt from virtue When all her blessings were shower'd down upon you. LORD TRANSIT. What have I done, that like a chidden boy You school me at this rate; which when I bear, You are beholden to your age? HEARTRIGHT. My age! If you can say I have no other claim Upon your patience, let your anger looseâ I fear it not. LORD TRANSIT. Hold, holdâI do remember That the last words my dying father spoke Bequeath'd me to your friendship, to your care. Give me your pardonâI am calm. HEARTRIGHT. Enough! You have dismiss'd your wife.âThat is a deed, Which if you cannot justify by fact, No sophistry can palliate. What induc'd you So to disgrace the woman of your choice? LORD TRANSIT. Unless I cou'd lay open to your sight The movements of my heart, I cou'd not answer Why, for no crime committed on her part, No fault, no failing, I dismiss'd my wife. But as the sailor sickens in the calm, So did the tame serenity, in which I liv'd, deprive my spirits of their spring, And made me sigh for change. HEARTLIGHT. And what a change! Lady Le Brun, for instanceâGracious Heaven, Cou'd such a change as that be worth a sigh? LORD TRANSIT. It costs me many. HEARTRIGHT. It will cost you more. Go on, go on. LORD TRANSIT. I see you know my weakness. HEARTRIGHT. Consult those casuists who have just now left you; They'll find a salvo to excuse your weakness. LORD TRANSIT. Hang 'em, dull rascals! HEARTRIGHT. Well! I grant 'em rascals: Yet are they the prime spirits of the time, Whom the men copy, and the women court. To undermine the virgin's chastity, The parent's peace, the wife's fidelity, The husband's honourâThese are modern arts, Events too trivial to create surprise, And crimes too common to extort a blush. LORD TRANSIT. My conscience hardly will subscribe to that. HEARTRIGHT. Hardly, I grant; for you have made of late A kind of cautionary truce with Virtue, Which tho' you've cancell'd, still your nature feels Some small repugnance to be all at once The monster that such wickedness will make you. But Vice, when once admitted to the heart, Soon grows familiar, talks reflection down, And from a rubric of her own can quote Lessons, to teach that passion is a plea For every crime that can defile the soul. [Exit. LORD TRANSIT. I cannot bear his lectures. They disturb me. His graceless manner mars his good intent, And checks, not turns me; puzzles, not persuades. [Exit. SCENE II. âA street. Pliant meeting Sir Charles Le Brun. PLIANT. Oh, by Olympian Jove, I'm charm'd to see you! Where are you going? SIR CHARLES. What is that to you? You're tipsy, my gay fellow. PLIANT. Well, I'm tipsy; That's granted.âWhat do you infer from that? Wine mends the memory; props the body up When the legs flinch their duty; makes the heart Beat a quick march upon the ribs, and scares Blue devils offâthat, else, would come at night In shape of owls, and hoot us into megrims. Wine gives us courage to defend our friends; And that I've done for you. SIR CHARLES. Who has assail'd me? PLIANT. Oh, as for that, leave me to tell you who. You have been rattled off at no allowance; Lord Transit is your man. SIR CHARLES. Hold! say no more: My house is close at handâWe are too publicâ This way, and recollect yourself the whilst. PLIANT. Give me your arm! So! that helps recollection. How is your beauteous lady? SIR CHARLES. What of her? PLIANT. By the nectareous gods, we pledg'd her health In brimmers of rich Burgundy, my boy! SIR CHARLES. Did my Lord Transit put that toast about? PLIANT. Did he? He did; and merrily it went, For no man stopp'd the bottle. Heh! what ails you? Ah, baronet, if you would start a quarrel With every man that shall admire your wife, You may turn out with thousands. SIR CHARLES. Come, this gabble Rouses no curiosity in me; I must hear graver mattersâCome along! [Exeunt. SCENE III. âA room in Fairford's house. Trevor and Lady Transit. TREVOR. And now, my noble cousin, welcome home. LADY TRANSIT. I've been a sad companion to you, George. TREVOR. Not so, not so. Your patience was so lovely, I am convinc'd it is a female virtue, Which I can never learn. LADY TRANSIT. 'Tis, as you say, A female virtue, for it springs from fear And awful dread of man's superior power: Ev'n now I tremble to approach my father. TREVOR. Why shou'd you tremble? Tho' he may come down As fierce upon you as a hungry bear, You know his nature.âHark, I hear him coming! Courage, sweet cousin! meet him without fear. [Exit. Fairford speaks as he is entering. FAIRFORD. Where is this child, this disobedient child? Come hither, hussey! You, my Lady Transit, Down on your knees, and ask your father's pardon, (She is about to kneel.) Hold! you sha'n't kneel to meâTake notice, child, Though I embrace, and press you to my heart, 'Tis not a certain proof that I forgive you. No, no; nor are these tears a mark of fondnessâ 'Tis fury, anger, rage, that wring them from meâ Are you not frighted? LADY TRANSIT. No, my dearest father. What can I fear from you, whose heart o'erflows With human kindness, not alone to me Your grateful daughter, but to all the world? FAIRFORD. You're wrong, you're wrong. It is not so. I'm chang'd: I've a new nature. Not one spark of pity Lives in my heart; 'tis frozen. LADY TRANSIT. Can it freeze And melt at the same time? FAIRFORD. How dar'd you marry Without my leave? LADY TRANSIT. You were in Russia, sir. My mother gave consent. FAIRFORD. Your mother! Yesâ Your motherâAh, she's gone; she is no more. Fierce, unforgiving as I am by nature, I will not speak of her, but as of one Who had the goodness of an angel in her, And now is gone where angels will receive her. In her 'twas a mistake;âin you a sin. LADY TRANSIT. I never sinn'd against you in my heart: Heav'n knows I never did. FAIRFORD. Come, don't tell meâ Your eye was caught with colours, and you took A painted pheasant for your tawdry mate, When you had match'd yourself, with better hopes Of lasting comfort, with an honest equal. And where's this lord of yours? No matter where; No matter where he is. I've nothing for him; No, not a shilling, though I'm monstrous rich, Rich to a surfeit:âI'll have no concern With lords or ladiesâI'll repair no castles, Buttress no broken fortunesâI'll endow And build an alms-house. LADY TRANSIT. Ah! I now perceive The reason why you call'd me up to Town; I am to lay the first stone of your alms-house. Your letter to my lord is now explain'd. FAIRFORD. I wrote no letter. 'Twas a fool that wrote it. LADY TRANSIT. He was no fool that sign'd it. FAIRFORD. Hold your tongue. Perhaps some little trifle I may give you To answer your expenses on the road, Because I'll take no favour from your lord. Here, here! You'll never have a farthing more. (Gives her a packet of bank bills.) LADY TRANSIT. And if I never have, 'tis great, 'tis noble.â Oh, my too generous, too indulgent father, How can I merit this excess of goodness, This unexampled bounty?â'Tis too much! FAIRFORD. I give thee nothing as Lord Transit's wife; To him or his I would not deal out bread; But to my darling child, to the dear image Of her blest mother, I will give my heart, My life, my allâFor thee alone I live, For thee, my child! [He embraces her, holds her in his arms for a time, then breaks from her, and speaks: There! now you've made me angryâ Leave me! I will not hear another word. LADY TRANSIT. Heav'n in its providence protect my father! [Exit. FAIRFORD. Poor thing, poor thing! That lord has us'd her ill, I know he hasâOh! had she but been happy, And proud, and prosperous, I had shut my heart As hard against her, and as icy cold As the warp'd Neva, when the fur-clad Russ Sleds o'er its glassy surface:âbut to tread The humbled and afflicted spirit down Is cruelty of so sublime a pitch, My nature is not quite prepar'd to reach it. Tim. Dogherty enters to Mr. Fairford. DOGHERTY. The blessing be about you, worthy sir, And long life to enjoy the goodly fortune That tumbles in upon you, so commodious! Troth, 'tis a lucky chance, when rascals scramble, If honest men get any of the booty. FAIRFORD. To whom am I indebted for this greeting? I do not recollect you. DOGHERTY. That may be, Seeing I've been a lodger forty years In yonder castle, where you've never been. FAIRFORD. What castle do you speak of? DOGHERTY. Ah, what castle? Why, that big house, where your sweet daughter dwelt, Blessing and blest by all, inside and out. Troth, you did well, when you had her, to stop; You hardly would have father'd such another Out of a hundred, if the Lord had sent them. FAIRFORD. You're an odd fellowâbut I now perceive You are my lord's domestic. DOGHERTY. Not at all. I'm not domestic with him. I belong To your sweet daughterâAh, there's nothing like her, I tell you so in plainnessâand moreover, I'm proud to let you know your own good name Is up among your people. FAIRFORD. Pooh! my people! What do they know of me? DOGHERTY. I'll tell you what. They know you for a crabbed shell without, But sound at heart, and wholesome. FAIRFORD. Who believes them? DOGHERTY. Whugh! who believes them! Take your own course then; And if you think they speak too well of you, Turn 'em away, and get another set To know you better, and to praise you less. FAIRFORD. You've got your nation's nimble wits, I see, And dare say you could make up a good story For your own lord. DOGHERTY. My nation you may know, But me you do not. I don't deal in stories, And when I can't speak well, can hold my tongue; Therefore, when you are nam'd, I shall be silent. FAIRFORD. Give me your hand! You and I must be friends. A Clerk enters. CLERK. A gentleman attends, whose name is Heartright. FAIRFORD. What is his business? I know no such person. CLERK. I think he is an agent of Lord Transit, And comes about the interest of your mortgage Upon that lord's estate. FAIRFORD. Well, let him pay it, And go about his business. DOGHERTY. Why, he comes About his business; can he come and go At the same moment? Ah, now, if you knew This worthy Mr. Heartright, as I know him, You'd throw your two fond arms about his neck, And hug him as your daughter's dearest friend. A better man don't breathe the breath of life; And would you have an honest gentleman trot From Hyde-Park Corner clear to Wellclose-Square, Only to see the outside of your house? FAIRFORD. Well, get you gone. I can't be angry with you. Tell Mr. Heartright I'll be glad to see him. [Exit Clerk. DOGHERTY. Why, now you answer like a British merchant. If you drive on a trade with all the world, Why, you must be at home to all the world. [Exit. Heartright enters. HEARTRIGHT. Your clerk has kept me waiting a good while: Perhaps I come unwelcome? FAIRFORD. By no means. HEARTRIGHT. I understand, old Gallishoff is dead: My business was with him about a mortgage, The interest of which is over-due From the Lord Transit. FAIRFORD. Have you brought the money? HEARTRIGHT. Truly, I have not: and my lord requests From the executors a little patience. FAIRFORD. I'm the executor. HEARTRIGHT. Well, if you are, You are the very man to do our business, If you have but the patience that we want. FAIRFORD. I'm not dispos'd to accommodate your friend. HEARTRIGHT. I guess'd as muchâIf I had brought the cash, Perhaps your patience would have serv'd to count it. You must foreclose. FAIRFORD. Perhaps I sha'n't do that. Lord Transit has enough, with management; But nothing is enough for dissipation. HEARTRIGHT. You're right. It play'd him but an ugly trick, When dissipation laid him at your mercy. FAIRFORD. I like your plainness. You may know your lord, But me you do not know. HEARTRIGHT. Nor do you know The lady of my lordâElse you would know, Though dissipation reign'd before her time, She brought good order. FAIRFORD. Pooh! she brought no fortune. HEARTRIGHT. True; in your sense of fortune, she brought nothing: In my sense, every thing that's rich and precious; Virtues above all price; and charms, that wealth Tenfold what you inherit could not purchase. FAIRFORD. You're warm in her applause. HEARTRIGHT. Because I know her. FAIRFORD. I know her too; and do not only pardon, But thank you for your warmth. I pray excuse me For a few moments. I will soon return. [Exit. HEARTRIGHT. Something has greatly mov'd him, I perceiveâ There is a feeling heart in that rough case; Therefore, by sympathy of soul I'm bound To bear with his coarse manners. I forgot To inform me of his nameâWhat do I see? My dear, my honour'd lady! How is this? Fairford returns with Lady Transit. LADY TRANSIT. Even as you see, my good and worthy friend! Give me your hand, and let me introduce you To my beloved father. HEARTRIGHT. Hah! your father! [They embrace. LADY TRANSIT. Yes; take him, sir, and wear him in your heart, As I in mine.âHe merits your esteem. [to her father. FAIRFORD. When you bestow'd such praises on my daughter, I was resolv'd to bring her face to face, And shame you for your flattery. Had you seen her, As when I left her, in the prime of youth And virgin bloom of beauty, then indeed You might have truly said, no wealth could reach The worth of charms like hers. I thought so tooâ And now behold a base injurious lord, A titled tyrant, first despoils those charms Of their pure lustre, and then turns away To whet his sated appetite afresh With profligate incitements. LADY TRANSIT. Hold, my father! Spare him, spare me, devoutly I implore, And take good heed you do not urge too far This aggravated charge beyond the bounds Of justice, truth, or mercy. Hear him first Before you strike so deep; examine well How far, though innocent of purpos'd ill, I, your own daughter, may have brought upon me The loss of his affections, from my want Of grace and judgment how to keep alive And fan that passion I had once inspir'd. Ah, sir, there's much allowance to be made For human errorsâWho can else abide it? HEARTRIGHT. There, there is patience in its fairest form! Put out your hand, and reach it. Who would keep So sweet an inmate in his family, And make no court to gain it? FAIRFORD. Who but you Would doubt my patience, when it stands the trial Of your rough sparring buffets? But I see You drive in your philanthropy head downwards; A clumsy workman: but as I am sure Your zeal is honest, and your love sincere For genuine virtue,âhere! I leave her with you. [Takes his daughter's hand, gives it to Heartright, and goes out.] Manent Lady Transit and Heartright. LADY TRANSIT. I'm glad we are alone. Oh sir! my friend, The friend of my lost lord; I don't accuse him. I pray you still to love him, to protect him, To guard him with your counselâThere is need. I only call Heav'n's truth to witness for me, That nor in deed, nor word, nor meditation Have I, unless in ignorance, giv'n him cause To treat me thus unkindly. HEARTRIGHT. I believe you: Nay, he himself acquits you. LADY TRANSIT. You have seen him?â HEARTRIGHT. I have. LADY TRANSIT. Then there is hopeâfor him, I mean. For me, my only wish is to enjoy That triumph, that revenge, which mercy feels When it redeems and pardons an offender. I know my lord, just now, is bare of money; And this new course of life may plunge him deeper, And drive him upon desperate resources. I cannot bear the thought. I brought him nothing: My father's bounty now has made me rich; Take him this money. HEARTRIGHT. What should I do with it? LADY TRANSIT. Tell him you've found an easy creditor; Yourself, for instanceâ HEARTRIGHT. That will never pass. LADY TRANSIT. Nothing so easyâLet him only find His wants supplied, he'll not be over curious To know from whom the obligation springs. HEARTRIGHT. If you supply his wants, you feed his wishes, And they are in no worthy train, believe me. LADY TRANSIT. I fear they are not; but he is no gamester. HEARTRIGHT. Lady Le Brun is. LADY TRANSIT. There! ah, there indeed You probe the wound, that rankles in his heart Unheal'd, untended!âThere you sound the depth Of my profound affliction! Hear me, now! I am resolv'd to see this dangerous fair one So fatal to my peace. I shall not play The clamorous Statira with my rival; Therefore mistake me not.âSir Charles Le Brun Upon my lord's departure found admission, And had, or feign'd, a letter from his lady To tender the asylum of her house. This is the plea for my intended visit. HEARTRIGHT. Are you determin'd on this rash adventure? LADY TRANSIT. Not to be mov'd. HEARTRIGHT. Then I will bear your message; For better 'twere for both, that you should meet Prepar'd for the occasion. Ah, dear lady! You take much pains for an unhappy man, Who is environ'd by a set of wretches Whose swords are at his throat, and push him on To ruin, to perdition. LADY TRANSIT. Save him then; For Heav'n's sweet sake redeem him; bid him fly The snares of that fair syren; set before him The horrors of his crime, the avenging sword Of an insulted husband.â'Tis an act Blessed for ever, that now calls upon you. [Exeunt. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âAn elegant apartment. Lord Transit and Lady Le Brun. LADY LE BRUN. Let go my hand, Lord Transit! Don't be tiresome. I tell you, once for all, I will be drawn Into no ambushes, no holes and corners. LORD TRANSIT. Stop here, then.âHere is room for all your virtue. LADY LE BRUN. Keep yours, then, at its proper distance from it, For I suspect they are scarce cater-cousins. LORD TRANSIT. Lady Le Brun, by heavens it makes me mad To see a woman, born to be the charm Of all mankind, devote herself so wholly To a vile crew of gambling sharks and tabbies, As if you had no soul but in your cards! LADY LE BRUN. Perhaps I do not wish to charm mankind. The most immediate jewel of my soul Is reputation. Now, then, you are answer'd, And in your own heroic style, methinks. LORD TRANSIT. Well, madam, I don't want to steal your jewels. Cards are more likely to purloin that treasure Than I am. LADY LE BRUN. I have heard enough of cards. What else have you to say? LORD TRANSIT. You gave me hopes That you would let me see Sir Charles's letter. LADY LE BRUN. Oh! aye; his letter about Lady Transit.â How can that int'rest you? You have dismiss'd That speculation, and are come to Town, In hopes to find that London husbands care As little for their wives as you for yours. LORD TRANSIT. You are sarcastic, madam. LADY LE BRUN. No; I think You have endur'd your matrimonial spell As long, at least, as any one who knows you Could have suppos'd; and when you broke the charm, You did not turn your charmer out of doors, As some less gentle husbands would have done, But civilly dismiss'd her to her father. Now that was so considerate, so kind, So careful of the jewel reputation, That every wife, who values her good name, Will hold Lord Transit henceforth and for ever In all due estimation and regard! LORD TRANSIT. Your wit, fair lady, carries a keen edge; And you can smite and smile at the same time. I know not how I have deserv'd this from you. LADY LE BRUN. I really think you can deserve no less From every woman, who has fellow-feeling For a much-injur'd, guiltless, virtuous wife. Ask not to see the letter from my husband; It would not flatter you,âunless, indeed, You hold it for a salvo to your conscience To put a pledge into his hands as sacred As that you would inveigle out of them. LORD TRANSIT. What pledge do you allude to? LADY LE BRUN. Let this billet By you, a married man, address'd to me, A married woman, show you to yourself. What have I done to warrant this affront? Here, take it back again!âMy only reason For not exposing it and you, my lord, To my vindictive husband, is because I abhor duels, and despise the writer. LORD TRANSIT. Why all this tragic fury?âI suspect You've lost at cards, my lady? LADY LE BRUN. If I have, It was my money only; not my mind, My character, my conscience, as you have. And what is there in me, which you can't find Fresher and fairer in your own pure wife? She loves not cards; has not consum'd her time, Or tainted the sweet lustre of her bloom, With a vile crew of gambling sharks and tabbies, As you say I have done. In slighting her For such a Town-complexion'd face as mine,â Upon my word, my lord, I think in taste You err as widely as in principle. LORD TRANSIT. You bear me down with words.âHear my defence. I do confess, from the first time my eyes Glanc'd on your form, I've been the slave of passion. I married, and believ'd I had subdued That dangerous enemy to my repose. Again I saw you, and again desire Seiz'd on my truant heart. I turn'd aside, From peace, from truth, from honour, to pursue you, And mark how I am punish'd! LADY LE BRUN. Not by me. I am not form'd, my lord, to make you happy. Look at Sir Charles; his temper is more placid, More mild than yours: he slights me; he has reason: I am not worthy to be call'd a wife, Being a thoughtless, undomestic creature; A woman of the world, as it is call'd, And not averse, as truly you observe, To the destructive desperate love of play. Is it not madness, then, to fly from her, Whose faultless heart was form'd to make you blest, And sigh for me, who would have made you wretched? LORD TRANSIT. Your self-accusing candour is so charming, The more you labour to extinguish hope The more you charm me and exalt yourself. LADY LE BRUN. Go home, go home. I tell you, as a friend, You never will succeed with me, my lord; And in the mean time others may succeed With your neglected lady. She's no more Than a mere woman, and I'm much mistaken If frailty be not moulded with the clay Of which we all are made. LORD TRANSIT. What do you mean? Your hints alarm me. LADY LE BRUN. Lay them to your heart: And recollect, that if she falls from virtue The guilt is yours, for you are her destroyer. [Exit. LORD TRANSIT. I thought I was a hard, unfeeling wretch, Whom no remorse could touch. I now perceive I am a thinking, conscientious villain, That never can know peace, and know myself The base destroyer of an injur'd wife, In whose arms I have slept and dreamt of virtue. (Pliant is passing the stage.) Stop, sir, a word with you. PLIANT. Hah! my dear lord, Ever well met. My eyes have been so dazzled With the bright blaze of beauty in that room, I do protest I did not see your lordship. LORD TRANSIT. You have said quite enough about your eyes; I hope you have not lost your memory. PLIANT. No, no; your lordship glances at what pass'd When last I din'd with you. LORD TRANSIT. Exactly that. PLIANT. Gay, lively, free, delectable discourse; Much wit, much humour, and some repartee; I thought your lordship made a pleasant run Upon my friend Le Brun:â'Faith, 'twas so good, I told it to him in my raillying way, Just to keep up the jest.âWhat ail'd the man, I cannot for the soul of me conceive; He couldn't taste the joke, but knit his brow, And gnaw'd his lips, and in a peevish fit Desir'd that I would give your lordship notice That he would wait on you to-morrow morning. This I have now the honour to perform. LORD TRANSIT. Yes, and the honour to create the cause Of his unfriendly visit.âTell him, therefore, Come when he will, from day-break to broad noon, He'll find me at his call. PLIANT. Spoke like yourself, With elegance and spirit, well becoming Your rank and fashionâDay-break to broad noon! [Exit. Lady Le Brun enters. LADY LE BRUN. My lord, my lord,âthe company's broke up. I'm going home. Take courage! I shall send you An invitation, which you'll not refuse; And we will bury all unkindness past, And seal a peace.âCome! see me to my coach. LORD TRANSIT. You puzzle meâI cannot comprehend you. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âThe street. Sir Charles Le Brun meeting Dogherty. SIR CHARLES. Well met, friend Timothy! what news with you? DOGHERTY. There now! to see how thoughts will sometimes jump, And justle one another in by jerks. Just as I met your honour, I was thinking What I should say, if any body ask'd me What news, friend Timothy? SIR CHARLES. Well, let us hear What you will say. DOGHERTY. Long life to your kind honour! It is good news if you are well in health. Health is a blessing, and the only one Which the poor have in common with the rich. SIR CHARLES. You serve the Lady Transit, I believe?â Pray, my good fellow, is she now in Town? DOGHERTY. Troth, sir, to say where any lady is, When she is out of sight, is above me. SIR CHARLES. But you can tell me if she was in Town When last you saw her. DOGHERTY. As I cannot speak To time and place correctly to your question, I humbly beg to waive it altogether. SIR CHARLES. You're dumb; but wine will make a dumb man speak. Will you accept a trifle to procure it? DOGHERTY. Sweet sir, most thankfully. Good wine's a jewel, And whisky punch, and whisky its ownself In its own naked innocence and beauty, As we enjoy it in our blessed nation; All these are harmless wholesome recreations. SIR CHARLES. Take this,âand now direct me to your lady. DOGHERTY. Ah, noble sir, I hope I'm better taught Than to lose any time in seeking out A comely public-house to drink your health in; And when I've done that handsomely, good chance If I am able to direct myself. Good day to your good honour! Ah! a guinea! [Exit. SIR CHARLES. The murrain light upon that Irish pagan! He has fobb'd me of my guinea, and gone off. But see! as sure as can be, 'tis the youngster That came to London with the Lady Transit. Trevor enters. Sir, your most humble servant! With your leave A few words, if your business is not pressing. TREVOR. Sir Charles Le Brun? SIR CHARLES. The sameâat your command. I think I saw you with the Lady Transit? TREVOR. 'Tis very possible. SIR CHARLES. You live, perhaps, In this part of the town? TREVOR. Yes, with my uncle. SIR CHARLES. And who is he? TREVOR. My mother's father's son. SIR CHARLES. That does not edify. TREVOR. I'm sorry for it. If in the way of business you wou'd know him, You'll trace him by the firm of Gallishoff As readily as you can find the Bank. If your inquiry only tends to ask Where Lady Transit may be visited, I have the honour to inform you, sir, That lady can receive no visitors. [Exit. SIR CHARLES alone. If she receives me, I shall little care How few besides may visit her. These citizens Give full instruction on their corner houses To lead us to their execrable shops, But not one finger-post that points to love. [Exit. SCENE III. âAn apartment in Fairford's house. A table with papers, parchments, &amp;c. Fairford, and Codicil his lawyer, discovered at table. FAIRFORD. There, there, friend Codicil, dash on! dash on! My meaning's clear enough till you explain it, And talk yourself and me into a puzzle. CODICIL. Who talks but you? And whilst your clack is going Thirteen to the dozen, who the plague can write? FAIRFORD. Call you this writing? Foh! your curst law scratches Won't give the honest alphabet fair play. Look how you crook your rs, and twist the necks Of your poor half-hang'd es, that look behind 'em As if you'd set your bailiffs at their heels! Come, where's this doughty deed of separation? CODICIL. Why, here it is; but what use is it of? You'll not enforce it. FAIRFORD. Yes, I will. CODICIL. You won't, I know you won't, and so I plainly tell you: You let that Heartright fob you of your mortgage: Every man draws a needle through your nose. FAIRFORD. What's this you've given me? This is not the deed; This is my will. You've caught the unclean beast By the wrong ear; you're puzzled. CODICIL. Well I mayâYou are enough to puzzle any man, Blustering and bouncingâHere! we're right at lastâ Give me your willâThat may come into use Some time or other, when you're dead and gone; For die you must. (They rise and come forward.) FAIRFORD. I do believe I must. You're right, friend Codicil, you're very right; You bring the pleasant recollection home: And when the time comes, which you kindly hint at, The will, perhaps, may be of use to some folks,â Yourself, amongst the rest, if you survive me. For I have tack'd a little rider to it, In your behalf, for old acquaintance-sake; Something to make your winter evenings merry. So there is codicil for Codicilâ That is but fair, you'll say. CODICIL. I'll not say that. I'm not of your opinion, Mr. Fairford. I do not hold it for a lawyer's honour To have his name found in his client's will. Leave me your snuff-box, or your walking-stickâ I'll take a token from youânothing more. FAIRFORD. I wou'd I had my walking-stick just now; You well deserve it. CODICIL. I don't care for that. You've ever been my friend, and that's enough. FAIRFORD. I was all that when I was nothing else; It wou'd be shameful were I less your friend When I've more means to be so. But, no matter; You are a mule, a veritable mule, And, thanks to Nature, generation stops; None of your cross-grain'd progeny will plague us. Whence come you, sirrah? Trevor enters. TREVOR. From my agent, sir, Thanks to your bounty! Here is my commission. I'm Ensign Trevor now. FAIRFORD. Pshaw! Ensign Trevor! I would have put you in a way to thriveâ Made you a merchant.âWould you think it, sir? This fellow had no taste for Russia duck, Hemp, pot-ash, pickled sturgeon, linen rags, And such nice wares as wou'd have quickly made him A prancing trader. He must be a soldier, And honourably starve on ensign's pay. So, let him go! I've done with you for ever: Go to your cousin; put on your red coat, (I know you have your regimentals ready) And let her see how clownish and how clumsy A Russian bear shows in a lion's skin. TREVOR. Very well, uncle! You and I have fac'd The north-sea storm, when not a rag of sail Clung to the yard; you did not find me then A man unfit for service, or afraid To look upon a sight more terrible Than armies can present: so launch your joke; Your Russian bear may with the lion's skin Possess the lion's heart. This I will promise, Go where he will, your bear sha'n't shame his leader. [Exit. CODICIL. That's a brave boy; he charms me, and behold! He pumps the water up into your eyes. FAIRFORD. No, no; they're weak, they're wat'ry. Come, I'll go And see Louisa.âPshaw! what ails my eyes? [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âAnother apartment. Lady Transit and Dogherty. DOGHERTY. Ah, gracious lady, how it glads my heart That you approve of your poor servant's answer To that Sir Charles Le Brun! I took his money, 'Tis true; but why? becase I scorn a bribeâ Whereby I neither laid it out, nor kept it: I gave it to a poor old beggar woman Of my own kindred, Judey Doghertyâ Quite an old creature. Troth, it did her good, For she was mighty boozy when I met her But a few minutes after. LADY TRANSIT. I should doubt If that could do her good. DOGHERTY. Oh yes, oh yes. It oil'd the springs and hinges of her heart, And made her dance and roll about for joy. LADY TRANSIT. She made herself a beast. DOGHERTY. How so, my lady? To get drunk is the privilege of reason; Beasts never find it out. LADY TRANSIT. That's truly said. DOGHERTY. Oh yes; I always like to say the truth, Whether of man or beastâwhereby, d'ye see, I trusted to my wits with that Sir Charles To keep clear of the truth, and tell no lie. Ach! I am good at that. Sir Charles, says I, 'Tis not for me to prate about my lady, Whether she's here or there, or no where else. LADY TRANSIT. Well, Tim, I've heard it once. We'll not repeat it. DOGHERTY. Your will is mine; but, by my faith I think 'Twould bear repeating! LADY TRANSIT. Tell it then to Ruth; It will be new to her. In the mean time I hear my father coming.âYou may leave me. DOGHERTY. The blessings of a thousand years be with you! Fairford enters. Sir, I'm your most devoted humble servant. Humph! not a word.âHe could not well say less. [Exit. FAIRFORD. There! there's a sickener for the queazy lord; Let him digest that paper as he can; I hope 'twill choke him. LADY TRANSIT. What does it contain? FAIRFORD. A list of his bad actions, and your good ones, About an equal quantity of each Fairly divided; and in this account No errors are excepted, I can promise. LADY TRANSIT. What does it lead to? FAIRFORD. What but separation? Where else should I lead, when he drives so hard? Does it surprise you? LADY TRANSIT. No, not much, not much; But it is rather sudden. FAIRFORD. How we differ! I thought it rather slow, and hurried on Old snail-pac'd Codicil into a gallop, That shook him in his saddle. What! a fellow To take my only child without my leave, And send her back without my leave or license!â Too much, too much! LADY TRANSIT. I am a woman, sir; I am a wife. FAIRFORD. Aye, so you areâa wife To one of the worst husbands in existence. But you've a father, who won't see you wrong'd. LADY TRANSIT. Sir, that I am your daughter is, I trust, Warrant enough that I have sense to feel, And spirit to resent the wrong that's done me. But separation is a serious act, And you will not refuse a little pause For meditation.âSpare me till to-morrow, And you shall have my answer. FAIRFORD. Pshaw! to-morrow! I hate to-morrow. A long sleepless night Lies between it and me. LADY TRANSIT. Kind Heaven forbid! The guardian spirit that protects the good Will watch your couch, and, with his balmy hand Laid on your aching temples, give you rest. Your dreams shall be compos'd of those pure thoughts Which only in untroubled bosoms spring, Whilst the good angel whispers to the soul Joys of hereafter, which to th'waking ear Cannot be told by tongue of mortal man. Go, goâBenevolence like yours, my father, Will need no rocking. FAIRFORD. Oh, that any fool Could own a gem so rare, and cast it from him! [Exit. LADY TRANSIT alone. That he has basely, cruelly renounc'd me, Without a shadow of pretence, is true; And that his treatment justifies the measure My father dictates, cannot be denied: Yet there is something at my heart, which pleads That time and healing leisure be allow'd To the relapse of virtue, and reminds me, Lest execution should too closely tread Upon the heels of judgment. I would act With all the dignity that's due to virtue, And not forget what charity prescribes. Let me with candour recollect myself:â When Transit married meâah! had I then Or wit to fascinate, or grace to charm, Or beauty to surprise? No, no, not I; Nothing beyond the common dole of nature To all her unsophisticated broodâ Freshness and health, simplicity of soul, And modesty innate:âSuch and no better He found and wedded me; such and no worse I still continued, and he put me from him. Trevor, in his regimentals, enters. TREVOR. Well, cousin, here I am, fresh boil'd and bright. How do you like me? LADY TRANSIT. Oh, to admiration! I think you'll do prodigious execution. TREVOR. I think I shallâabroad eventually; At home particularly. My uncle calls me A Russian bear: if so, you know, sweet cousin, I can plead instinct, if I'm tried for hugging. LADY TRANSIT. I am afraid, friend George, your uncle thinks You choose a poor trade, and forgo a rich one. TREVOR. I think I choose well, when I take a trade Which puts me on a par with any man Who dares to wrong a lady, of whose honour By fair succession I'm the avow'd defender. My King has slung a sword upon my thigh, (I thank His Majesty) and I take credit For a bright forethought, when I learnt to use it: In that accomplishment I yield to none. LADY TRANSIT. I'm sorry you're so learned in that art. TREVOR. I think I could not learn a better art, Than to protect the feeble and opprest Against the strong and brutal. LADY TRANSIT. Then go forth; Find my Lord Transit out; be my averger; Not against himâbeware! He is my husbandâ But against those seducers who distract And warp his virtues from their natural bent. TREVOR. Beware how you employ me with your lord, Who, by insulting you, has given to me A stab, which, if he does not well atone for, Will never heal in my flesh; never, never, Till I have made reprisals upon his. LADY TRANSIT. George, George! why will you terrify me thus, And breathe defiance whilst I sigh for peace? TREVOR. I cannot help it. I have dearly lov'd you From infancy to youth, from youth to manhood, And shall love to the last-drawn breath of life. But I was poor, and never did my heart Cherish a hope of you; for you had charms To claim the prospect of a match as noble As this which you have gain'd. When fortune shower'd These riches on your father, and I heard Of the injurious treatment you receiv'd, All other views but the redressing you Vanish'd at once; and I besought my uncle To make me what I amâhis lordship's equal, And the declar'd avenger of your wrongs. LADY TRANSIT. I know your generous motives, and can trace them To that pure source of brotherly affection Which you have nourish'd from your earliest years. But though your spirit may be still awake, Your sword, I hope, will sleep. TREVOR. It shall, it shall. I'll see your lord, and for your sake be calm. I know there is a luxury in mercy, Which to your soft sensations gives delightâ Though I don't feel it, nor does he deserve it. LADY TRANSIT. Ah! if we stay to calculate his merit, We shall outstay the time to save his life. Treat men as they deserveâmake it your rule To deal no more than rigid justice claims, To your frail fellow-creatures,âwhat becomes Of those sweet charities that give the soul Its conscious foretaste of unfading bliss, Make the day cheerful, and our nightly couch A bed of roses redolent of heaven? [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Lord Transit alone. LORD TRANSIT. So heavily my sleepless hours have pass'd, That though 'tis morning to the world, to me It comes in darkness like another night. Dogherty enters. DOGHERTY. My lord, my lord! I hope you'll not be angry, If poor old Dogherty peeps in upon you Just to sayâWhat's your pleasure?âCan I serve you? LORD TRANSIT. Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you, Tim. DOGHERTY. That's mighty good and gracious in your lordship. Forty long years of service in your family Have made your house, as 'twere, my nat'ral home: And though I serve a sweet and kindly lady, (Ah, Heav'n be with her!) still, I know not why, I feel myself a stranger at her father's; And my old heart will cherish a fond hope That we are not cut off, but I may live To stand behind your lordship's chair once more, And see your lovely lady grace your table. LORD TRANSIT. Is she in health? Does she support her spirits? DOGHERTY. In truth, my lord, her spirits want support; But still an easy conscience can do much: And now, but that I fear to give offence, I should have ask'd your lordship the same question: I'm cruelly afraid you are not well. LORD TRANSIT. I've had a restless night. DOGHERTY. Ah, there's the case. I thought as muchâYour looks betoken it;â No rest at night!âThis Town air does not suit you. LORD TRANSIT. I'm sick at heart, old man. Nothing can suit me; Nor air, nor hours, nor any thing that throws One gleam of comfort on the human heart, Is now in store to cheer me. DOGHERTY. Ah! my lord, Your castle stands exactly where it did. The road is open. LORD TRANSIT. Yes, the road is open That I must travel. It takes in creation: All that have life must tread it. Servant enters. SERVANT. Please your lordship, An officer, who says his name is Trevor, Desires to see your lordship. LORD TRANSIT. Show him up. I shall be glad to see him. [Exit Servant. DOGHERTY. And you'll see As brave and bright a boy as walks the earth; Ay, and a pretty swordsman, a neat hand.â I took a thrust or two with him at foils, In faith, I had it in my stomach quickly: I was but as a child with him. LORD TRANSIT. He comesâ Leave us together. [Exit Dogherty. Trevor is introduced. TREVOR. As I've not the honour To be known to your lordship, I must hope My near alliance to the Lady Transit Will plead in my excuse. LORD TRANSIT. I understand You are her near relation, and am happy To show you all respect on her account. TREVOR. It is on her account I wait upon you; At her request, whose generous heart yet feels An interest in your safety, I consent, Ev'n at my honour's risk, to warn your lordship What peril you are in. LORD TRANSIT. Do you allude To any thing about Sir Charles Le Brun? TREVOR. I've no connection with Sir Charles Le Brun. LORD TRANSIT. Has Lady Transit seen him? TREVOR. Never, never. But as I see to what your question leads, I beg, my lord, you'll put none such to me, As in the slightest manner tends t'impeach The spotless purity of my relation. LORD TRANSIT. You're very quick, and I am not aware That any thing I've said can give offence. TREVOR. If I am over zealous in this cause, Your lordship hardly will complain of me, Seeing I now by right of kindred fill That honourable post which you have quitted. LORD TRANSIT. Sir, do you recollect to whom you're speaking? TREVOR. Yes, to Lord Transit, who, by happy choice, When he had worthily bestow'd his hand Upon a creature form'd to crown his days With envied blessings, haughtily withdrew it, And threw the slighted virtue from his arms To beg protection at her father's door. LORD TRANSIT. Am I so lost to virtue? No; you wrong me. Awe-struck, I mark how strong her pulses beat, Ev'n in the arteries of a beardless boy; How high in energy sublime she lifts Your swelling spirit up, and tramples down My coward conscience grov'ling in the dust. Servant enters. SERVANT. My lord, Sir Charles Le Brun, and Mr. Pliant. [Exit Servant. Sir Charles Le Brun and Pliant enter. SIR CHARLES. Lord Transit, may we speak to our affair Before this gentleman? LORD TRANSIT. He'll answer that. TREVOR. If there is no objectionâ SIR CHARLES. None whatever. Your lordship has been pleas'd to treat my name With undue liberty before my friends Sir Harry Sumner and this gentleman, Who has reported to me what you said, And what no man of honour can put up with, Unless by revocation most express, And unequivocal, you shall recall it. LORD TRANSIT. Sir Charles Le Brun, our conference will be short; For if that gentleman sits at my table, And chooses, in defiance of the rights Of hospitality, to recollect Words utter'd in the heedlessness of talk, I am not careful to correct my speech Under the terror of his information, Nor shall recall one syllable I spoke. PLIANT. Recall it! No, my lord, sooner than that I'm ready to recall my recollection. SIR CHARLES. How, sir! do you equivocate? Take care. PLIANT. Yes; I am very careful to avoid A quarrel any how, with any body. When I am tipsy, 'tis another thing: But soberly I think the words of man Should not be weigh'd against the life of man. Egad, for my part I would sooner eat them. SIR CHARLES. Then you must eat them. PLIANT. Well, and so I will, Give me but wine enough to wash 'em down. Lord love you both! two of my dearest friends! What harm could I intend to either of you? The wine was in my head; I met Sir Charles; Went home with him, and told him our discourse, As a good joke:âBut he, brim-full of honour, Took it in dudgeon, brew'd it in his mind, Bottled it up in secrecy, and stor'd it Where it fermented,âwhilst I fell asleep, Unconscious of the folly I committed. Now, my good lord, and sir, shake hands, I pray you; And don't let a poor devil hang himself, For doing mischief which he never meant. LORD TRANSIT. Sir Charles, how say you? For my part, I think Friend Pliant's plea is irresistible. SIR CHARLES. I think so too, my lord; but as I see A gentleman of the army has been present At the discussion of this point of honour, Let us refer it to his arbitration. LORD TRANSIT. With all my heart. PLIANT. Now, dear good sir, for once, Though I don't know your name, take to your heart A little harmless wholesome recollection; And as you are a fine young hopeful cub Of the old British lion, copy him, Whose honest gallant heart abounds in mercy: I'm at your feet. He always spares the fallen. Odslife! how eloquent it makes a man, When he is pleading to the heart of man! SIR CHARLES. Now, sir, we wait your judgment. TREVOR. 'Twou'd be rash, And ill becoming me, to interpose My feeble judgment, were it not a case Too plain for a mere novice to mistake. I think Lord Transit shou'd assure sir Charles There was no malice in the words he spoke; And I am very certain there is due A full apology from Mr. Pliant To the Lord Transit, for a breach of trust.â This being done, I see no cause for quarrel. SIR CHARLES. Fairly decided! All is past, and over: All words that have been said, are done away; All that should still be said, I will suppose Are said; and so, good morning to your lordship. [Exit. PLIANT. Now, that's too brief for meâI rather like To make my exit with a handsome speech. My good Lord Transit, I've a shallow head, And a fool's tongue; but I've an honest heart! And honestly I ask your lordship's pardon. [Lord Transit gives his hand.] Sir, I pray Heav'n no bullet may annoy you, But that your enemies will let you live To be a blessing to your friends, and sit Content with glory, and replete with years, A fine old prosing grave gray-headed General, And fight your battles in your easy-chair. [Exit. Heartright enters. TREVOR. Your lordship will allow me now to leave you. [Exit. HEARTRIGHT. The merchant will accommodate your lordship About the interest due upon the mortgage. LORD TRANSIT. I scarce expected it. HEARTRIGHT. You'd no great right To expect it, give me leave to say, Seeing that merchant is your lady's father. The rich old Russian Gallishoff is dead, And has bequeath'd his wealth, a boundless mass, To a plain, honest, well-deserving man, The father of your lady, who is now One of the richest heiresses in England. LORD TRANSIT. Then Providence has made its work complete. Nature had giv'n her charms, Heav'n had endow'd Her heart with charity; and Fortune now, Who had withheld her boon, at length relents, And largely recompenses past unkindness. HEARTRIGHT. If you've occasion for a sum of money In making up your balance with the world; And a few thousands can accommodate, I have them for you. I have found a person That lends on easy interestânothing more Than a demand upon your heart at sight. LORD TRANSIT. She has my heart, she has my full contrition Unpurchas'd and sincere.âSo tell your sender; So tell my injur'd wife; and say withal, This self-accusing scroll, in which she'll read The anguish of my heart, and trace my tears, Was dictated by conscience, by remorse, By zeal to vindicate her spotless fame: In this, when ign'rant of what now has chanc'd, To raise the humble state in which I found her, I give her all that I have power to give. HEARTRIGHT. Well, I will take your olive-branch in charge; And may it prove the emblem of a peace At length concluded 'twixt your heart and Heaven! LORD TRANSIT. I have receiv'd much good instruction from you, And paid you hitherto with little else But disappointment, sorrow, and vexation. Now, from this moment you shall blush no more For pains mispent, and kindness ill-applied. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA chamber in Fairford's house. Dogherty enters. DOGHERTY. So, there's no fight at last! Well, let it go. Some folks, I see, can quarrel without fighting; My countrymen can fight without quarrel. 'Tis mighty neat and natural for a gentleman, Who makes a pastime in that kind of sport, And loses nothing when his life is lost; But not quite so commodious for a lord, Who occupies a castle,ânot like those Which some of my good friends build in the air, But solid brick and stone on the dry ground. Ruth enters. RUTH. Ah, Mr. Dogherty, wou'd you believe it? My lady is gone out. DOGHERTY. I believe that, Because I saw it. RUTH. Nay, but hear me outâ As sure as can be, she will make it up With her false lord.âWere I so fine a lady, Aye, and so rich withal, wou'd I do that? No: I wou'd bring him down upon his knees, That's what I wou'd; and so I tell my lady, And so I say to every one. DOGHERTY. Stop there! I wish to breathe a secret in your ear, Which, if you blab it, shall remain a secret; For I will never tell it you again. RUTH. Oh, Mr. Timothy, I am so happy To hear you talk! DOGHERTY. Then you must hold your tongue. Observe me nowâThere are two kinds of silence: One is a silence that don't talk at all; That's not your methodâT'other is a way To keep all folks from talking but yourself: Now in that sort of silence you are perfect. RUTH. Well! I have done; I've done. DOGHERTY. Recollect then, That damsels of the bed-chamber like you, Who are a virgin (if I'm wrong, correct me), Shou'd never prate about their lords and ladies. It is not seemlyâShut your lips, sweet Ruth, And don't be cackling to betray your nest. There, there; that's all. Here's Mr. Heartright comingâ Good b'ye, sweet Ruth! RUTH. Ah, you're a cunning creature; You twist and turn me just which way you will. [Exit. Heartright enters, meeting and stopping Dogherty. HEARTRIGHT. Where is your lady? DOGHERTY. Not at home just now. HEARTRIGHT. Gone out? DOGHERTY. You've hit upon it, worthy sir: She is gone out, and therefore not at home. HEARTRIGHT. Is Fairford in the house? DOGHERTY. Aye is he; close With that old Codicil, driving the quill To separate these poor creatures from each other; Which you know may be law, but is not gospel. HEARTRIGHT. I think of it as you do. DOGHERTY. To be sure. 'Tis strangulation to my lord at once; And under favour, I'm not rightly sure 'Twou'd be quite wholesome in my lady's case. And where's the use of battering their brains For slight-of-hand tricks now, to slip the knot That blessed Mother Church had tied too tight For all their botheration to undo? HEARTRIGHT. Fear nothing, my good fellow: I'm persuaded I have a weapon to defeat their purpose. DOGHERTY. You have indeed, if you've a stout shelelah To carry with you into consultation. It splits a difference in no time at all, And beats all heads into the same opinion. HEARTRIGHT. I bear the olive, Tim, and not the sword. DOGHERTY. If you take one without the other, sir, Ev'n tie the olive branch about your neck, And ask the next stray friend to tuck you up. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âAn apartment in Lady Le Brun's house. Lady Le Brun speaking to a Servant. LADY LE BRUN. When Lady Transit comes, you will admit her. Take notice, I'm at home to no one else. [Exit Servant. Well, I protest I am so greatly taken With my new character, I really think I shall lay by my old one.âSir, you playâ Madam, you dealâMy lady, you have lost. Ah! that's a dull tune, and has tir'd my ears; I'll e'en leave them to sing it out, that like it. Gaming! good b'ye! you never was my friendâ Prudence! your servantâPretty miss, how prim And proper you are dress'd! you wear deep tuckers, And keep good hoursâWell! I won't promise either. But come, sweet Pity! whom I always lov'd, Celestial Charity, whom I adore, Come, ye kind Virtues, I am all your own! Servant enters. SERVANT. The Lady Transit, madam. [Exit Servant. Lady Transit enters. LADY LE BRUN. My dear lady, I'm honour'd by this visit. You seem faint; My tedious stairs have tir'd youâWill you sit? LADY TRANSIT. You're very kind. I'm sensible I can't conceal my weakness; But I persuade myself that you can pity it. LADY LE BRUN. A woman to a woman needs not blush To own her weakness; and perhaps there needs No great sagacity to guess the cause. Ah, madam, I am not without experience How little trust can be repos'd in husbands, And cou'd, if needful, tell as bad a tale Of my good man, as you can do of yours. We, who are wives, shou'd make it common cause: Therefore confide in me; I sha'n't betray you. LADY TRANSIT. I was a girl obscurely, humbly bred, And little grac'd with those attractive powers, Which you possess, to charm the hearts of men, And draw them back again if they attempt To escape from your allurements. LADY LE BRUN. My dear lady, I see that you mistake me, and are seeking To find a by-path to an open heart. Do me more justice, and believe for once A woman of the world can be sincere. Had I those fascinating charms you speak of (Which, by the way, my glass could never show me), I might perchance have sent a random glance At some pert heartless coxcomb for my sport, And teas'd him with a little cat-like play; But to alarm the wife, allure the husband, And do unholy mischief with my eyes,â Sooner than that, I'd rather be a mole, Condemn'd to grope in darkness all my life. LADY TRANSIT. Ah, now I see how much I am undone; For if I hear you talk a little longer, And see you smile, I shall acquit my husband. LADY LE BRUN. Aye; but I do not smile upon your husband; And when I talk, 'tis only with a view To talk him out of his absurdity. The silly man, because I lost my money, Thought I must be a loser every way. LADY TRANSIT. Then you have seen him?â LADY LE BRUN. Oh, yes, I have seen him, And, till he married, saw him every where, Prowling from place to place, and making eyes At each stray missâmyself amongst the many. He call'd it love. It made no way with me; For my sage mother bade me set my cap At none but marrying men. He was not that; And now he is that, be assur'd his lordship Is further off than ever. LADY TRANSIT. You console me. LADY LE BRUN. Ah! you may draw that consolation, madam, From nineteen fellow-sufferers out of twenty. I laugh my cares away; for ridicule Puts melancholy down as it does pride. Your lord is gone, as those sage persons go Who hunt for butterflies,âon a short tour, To seek about for what he'll never find. Nay, more; I know he's jaded, sicken'd, sham'd Out of his freak already.âCome to me This afternoon, you'll see him at your feet. LADY TRANSIT. How can that be expected? LADY LE BRUN. I'll secure it. I will apprise him he shall meet you here And seal a peaceâI'll answer for his coming. LADY TRANSIT. At what hour shall I come? LADY LE BRUN. At eight precisely. LADY TRANSIT. Is there no chance that I shall meet Sir Charles? LADY LE BRUN. Sir Charles is off, and whirl'd away as fast As four lean post-horses can scour the road. Yet, you are right to guard against that chance. Sir Charles is mischievous, I fairly tell you; And if a man of his aspiring sort Once sets his foot though on the lowest streak Of sly seduction's ladder, let the virtue Which he assails beware. I ask your pardon: I know this caution don't apply to you. LADY TRANSIT. In truth, it does not. LADY LE BRUN. Then you'll come this evening? LADY TRANSIT. Yes, I will comeâI cannot, will not doubt her. (Lady Le Brun rings the bell.) LADY LE BRUN. Who waits? Call up the Lady Transit's coach. LADY TRANSIT. Lady Le Brun, my fate is in your hands; And I must hope, that one by Heav'n endow'd With such sweet graces, such persuasive powers, Would not employ them but to those good ends For which they were bestow'd. LADY LE BRUN. No; I can mix With a bad world, and be the friend of virtue: Of course your friendâAt eight I shall expect you. Now where is that provoking creature Pliant? [Exit Lady Transit. Pliant enters to Lady Le Brun. PLIANT. Oh! here I am. LADY LE BRUN. Aye; you're a dear good soul! I've tir'd your patience out. PLIANT. No; I am us'd to't. Nobody lets me in till they've let out All others, and are weary of themselves. My whole life through has been a waiting job: I've waited for preferment; it don't come: I've waited for the death of a rich aunt; The old girl is immortal: I have waited For promises, for friendships, for the favours Of the fair sex.â LADY LE BRUN. Aye, there you wait in vain. PLIANT. Well, but I look'd to have snapt a dainty widow: Seven years her husband was a dying man. He died at last: I staid her mourning out; So did not she:âShe married in six months. I wait for every one; no one waits for me, Except my creditors. LADY LE BRUN. Now, stop your tongue, And listen to th'instructions I shall give you. Find out Lord Transitâfind him, do you mind me, Let him be where he will; take no denialâ Be sure of that. PLIANT. I will, I will be sure. I have a way of dealing with denials; They don't daunt meâI'm too well us'd to them. LADY LE BRUN. Now you must tell him I have had a visit From his afflicted lady. PLIANT. What afflicts her? She's a fine womanâI should like to comfort her. LADY LE BRUN. Oh, thou tormenting wretch! I'll trust no message To such a windmill-headed thing as thou'rt. I'll write a letterâyou can carry that. Come, follow meâI'm going to my closet. PLIANT. Aye, so am IâI'm very fond of closets. [Exeunt. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âThe Green Park. Sir Charles Le Brun alone. SIR CHARLES. Lady le Brun believes me out of town. It is not much amiss sometimes to try These small deceptions on our loving wives, Merely to mark how harmlessly they pass Their melancholy hours when we are absent. My lady is a miracle of goodness; Devotes best portion of her time to play,â Yet finds some hours to moralise, no doubt, With the Lord Transit. Pliant appears. Hah! your servant, sir! Your very humble servant, Mr. Pliant! Are you not now of all mankindâ PLIANT. The best.â I know you meant to say it: but don't praise me; Your praise confounds me: I can bear my own, I'm us'd to that. SIR CHARLES. You will have none from me. Why did you trap me into a discussion With Transit, and then turn about, and leave me To be a laughing-stock, for my credulity? PLIANT. Why did I turn about?âWas it not time? Cou'd I be too respectful of a life So infinitely precious to the world? Who wou'd have led the fashions of the Town, Had we lost you? How many brilliant eyes Wou'd have been blind with weeping! SIR CHARLES. Come, no raillery. I think my wife, for one, wou'd have surviv'd it. PLIANT. Oh such an angel woman! such a heart! SIR CHARLES. What do you know of her? PLIANT. What do I know? Enough to canonize her for a saint. SIR CHARLES. To which of all her numberless perfections Has she made you the confidential witness? PLIANT. You'll seeâyou'll see. SIR CHARLES. I shall be glad to hear What I'm to see. PLIANT. You're going out of Townâ SIR CHARLES. Within this hour. PLIANT. Go, go! you safely may. Her time will be most blessedly employ'd; She is the most benevolent of beings: Your house will be the scene of reconcilement. I've been to Transit with your lady's letterâ Oh! such a peace-maker! SIR CHARLES. A perfect saint. PLIANT. You see that I know something. SIR CHARLES. Yes, I see it. You saw the letter too? PLIANT. I saw her write it. SIR CHARLES. You took it to him? PLIANT. To be sure I did. SIR CHARLES. Quite right, quite right. It was an invitation? PLIANT. At eight o'clock this evening.âAh, my friend, You are the happiest manâ SIR CHARLES. You make me so, By telling me the virtues of my wife. At eight this evening? PLIANT. Yes. SIR CHARLES. Before that hour I shall be fifty miles upon my way. Good b'ye! I must make ready for my journey. [Exit. PLIANT. There, there now! Sure I am the luckiest fellow At making people happy with each other! It is a giftâby Heav'n, an actual gift! It can be nothing less. There is he gone As gayly out of Town, as free from care, As if he had no wife at all to think of. My lady may be virtuous, nay, she is so For aught I know; but if I were her husband, I should not take that letter quite so coolly: I watch'd her as she wrote it, and can swear To more than one tear that the writing cost her. Well, wellâI'm but the bearer of the letter; And be it what it may, by this manÅuvre I've made all parties safe. Trust me for that. Yes, yes; I take that credit to myself. [Exit. SCENE II. âAn apartment in Lord Transit's house. LORD TRANSIT reading a letter. âI have appointed your afflicted wife âTo come to me this night at eight o'clockâ âIf your heart feels compunction, meet her here, âAnd take her pardon; take her to your arms, âAnd let her intercession turn aside âThat wrath which Heav'n will else discharge upon you.â âClara Le Brun.â Yes, Clara, I obey Your anxious summons. Now I understand Your promise, as I led you to your coach, Of an appointment. All which then appear'd Dark and equivocal, is bright and clear. Why did I suffer my dishonest thoughts To build unfair presumptions on the chance That Gaming had expos'd you to seduction? Virtue, I see, can take so bright a polish, That e'en that dÃ¦mon's touch cannot defile it. Servant enters. SERVANT. My lord, some gentlemen in company With Mr. Fairfordâ LORD TRANSIT. I am not at home. SERVANT. I told him so; but he'll take no refusal. LORD TRANSIT. What is the hour? SERVANT. Just on the stroke of eight. And see! he has follow'd me to the very door. [Exit Servant. Fairford enters, followed by Heartright and Codicil. LORD TRANSIT. Well, Mr. Fairford, since you won't be answer'd By any apology, behold me present. FAIRFORD. You are the man I wanted to behold. And here's your paper, that friend Heartright brought;â A handsome recantation, I acknowledgeâ All written with your own hand, is it not? LORD TRANSIT. It is my writing, and it was my paper. FAIRFORD. It was your paperâRight! It is mine now: And in return for paper, there is parchment. (pointing to the mortgage deed in Codicil's hand.) That was your mortgage to old Gallishoff; It came to me, and now it goes to you. Take it, I've nothing more to do with it. You've clear'd my daughter, I clear your estate. LORD TRANSIT. Hold, Mr. Fairford: 'tis not yet the time That honour will allow me to receive itâ I beg you will release me. FAIRFORD. Heh! release you? Egad, I rather think we shou'd confine you: You're in a high delirium, a brain-fever. LORD TRANSIT. Well, be that as it may, I must decline it: Imperious reasons force me to decline it. FAIRFORD. Imperious reasons! Let me tell you, sir, I've reasons as imperious as yours can be, Aye, and resentments too. LORD TRANSIT. I cannot help it. Lady Le Brun invited me this evening To meet my wife, and to receive my pardon. My heart with joy embrac'd the blest occasion To pour out all its penitence, its thanks, Its hoarded transports of returning love, And vow eternal truth in her dear arms; When lo! with all my passions Alive, and kindling fire in every vein, You come, you cross me in the very hour, The instant of my fateâ'Sdeath! cou'd you offer The wealth of worlds, I wou'd not stop to take it. [Exit. FAIRFORD. Oho! that gives the case another colour: Those are imperious reasons, I confess. I'm not so angry now, nay I must own My anger was for once in the wrong place. HEARTRIGHT. Every man's anger is in the wrong place. FAIRFORD. I'm satisfied; I'm calm; my heart's at rest. CODICIL. So is your mortgageâI may take this home. FAIRFORD. No, give it me. CODICIL. 'Tis safer in my keeping; Your pocket burns, my friend. FAIRFORD. Well, if it does; Methinks I take the ready way to quench it. CODICIL. I don't care what you do. When you were poor, I lik'd you most; and when you're poor again, I shall not like you less. I only say, Give to the worthy man, and you give well; But give to every man for giving's sake, When your whim's over, you will find yourself With empty pockets in a thankless world. [Exit Codicil. HEARTRIGHT. There's no great flattery to mankind in that; But there's a plaguy deal of truth, I fear. FAIRFORD. Hear, and then judge. Amongst my dead wife's papers I have discover'd letters that have pass'd Betwixt this lord and her; and it appears That in my absence, when the best of beings (She for whose sake I wou'd have sluic'd my blood) Was pincht by poverty, even to want Of common necessariesâOh my God! ....... Sir, I perceiv'd myself his lordship's debtor For sums, not great perhaps in their amount, But greatly, nobly, delicately giv'n, Without parade or vaunting.âNow, by Heav'n! I were a dog, not fit to feed on scraps, If I cou'd hold a claim upon his purse, Though thousands hung to it, whose hand was open To the necessities of that dear saint When cruel want oppress'd her.âAm I right? HEARTRIGHT. I think you are, and do believe you'll find, When every heart is search'd, you have been right. Let us withdraw. FAIRFORD. Aye, aye; we'll give them time For reconcilement, and then share their joys. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âLady Le Brun's chamber. Lady Le Brun ushers in Lady Transit. LADY LE BRUN. This way, dear madam! You're before your timeâ But never mind; my lord will soon be here; I'm sure he will. I show you to this chamber, Because it is my private sacristy, Which nobody approaches. Shall I stay, Or be at hand to usher in your lord? LADY TRANSIT. Stay a few minutes, but till I recover My flutter'd spirits. LADY LE BRUN. Come, come, be compos'd; I can ensure your perfect reconcilement. LADY TRANSIT. Indeed!âI feel as if it cou'd not be. I won't detain you longer. I'll attend And wait my lord's arrival. LADY LE BRUN. I obey you. Alas, poor thing! (aside). [Exit. LADY TRANSIT. What did that look imply? It seem'd like pity; it might be contempt; They are allied too nearly. Did I not Come here unsanction'd by my father's leave? And can I wonder if chastising Heaven Provides a punishment for disobedience? O Trevor, gallant friend, what wou'd I give That thou wert now beside me! Ha! who's that? Sir Charles Le Brun appears. SIR CHARLES. A friend as gallant, and not less dispos'd Than Trevor to protect you. Fear me not! Whilst you are silent, you are in no danger; If you cry out, you bring destruction down On all around you, and perhaps this chamber Shall float with your unworthy husband's blood. LADY TRANSIT. Sir Charles Le Brun, I set you at defiance. I find that innocence can feel no fear; That conscious virtue buoys my spirit up, To meet your menaces with firm contempt. Why should I cry, when there are none to hear? When you, whose heart no pity can approach, Have barr'd your doors from them who might have felt it? SIR CHARLES. You do me wrong: you wrong the truest friend That ever sacrific'd his heart's best feelings To pity, to respect, to love for woman. Your faithless husband spurn'd you from his doors, I open'd mineâYou've enter'd, and are safe. LADY TRANSIT. Then let me pass. SIR CHARLES. Stop! you must hear me firstâ I felt your wrongs, and seiz'd the first occasion To vent my vengeance on the man who wrong'd you: His insolence soon gave me fair pretenceâ My sword was ready; but you stay'd my hand. LADY TRANSIT. Did I? Your conscience will have cause to bless me. SIR CHARLES. I sheath'd my sword at Trevor's intercession, Who spoke, as I believ'd, by your commission. Now will you tell me I am not your friend? Now will you spurn me, set me at defiance? Now will you turn my fury on your husband? Or hear me plead my passion at your feet, And let me seize this unopposing hand, And press it to the fondest, truest heart That ever beat within a lover's breast? LADY TRANSIT. Thou wretch! thou murderer, if this be death That now comes over meâdark, dark, and coldâ (She faints, and Sir Charles supports her.) SIR CHARLES. Heav'ns! I have gone too farâShe faintsâshe falls. Here after a pause, Lord Transit enters unseen by Sir Charles, and stands horror-struck, while Sir Charles proceeds: Oh, let my arms support you! let my breast Be Beauty's pillow, lovelier in its paleness Than when its roseate lustre glow'd so bright That my rapt eye cou'd hardly rest upon it. LORD TRANSIT. I'm petrified with horrorâNo! Go on; Stir notâbut what you have subdued, support, And prop the ruin that records your triumph! SIR CHARLES. Hear me, my lord! LORD TRANSIT. I will not hear you, sir; Nor will I stay to look upon that wreck Of all that was divine, and pure, and lovely. Alive we never part. I shall wait for you. [Exit. Lady Le Brun runs to the assistance of Lady Transit. LADY LE BRUN. My lord, my lord, return! Sir Charles, you've kill'd her; Inhuman wretch, you've kill'd herâHence, away! Go, hide yourself for everâI'm your wife, And cannot speak the word that fits your crime. Trevor rushes in, and draws his sword. TREVOR. I canâa villain! With that word I stamp you, And with my sword am ready to confirm it. LADY LE BRUN. Put up your sword! For Heav'n's sweet sake forbear! Cease your loud anger! She revives! she lives! TREVOR. Louisa, I am with you. LADY TRANSIT. Raise me up. George, something terrible, I know, has happen'd; But I am innocentâWhere is my lord? Send for him! Madam, if you are sincere, You can explainâ LADY LE BRUN. And willâalthough the truth Will strike conviction to that heart, whose honour Shou'd be as dear to me as is my own. Lord Transit, followed by Fairford and Heartright. LORD TRANSIT. Bay not me, sir, with your outrageous din; Come in, and see your daughter in the arms Of her triumphant lover. FAIRFORD. No, not she; She is in no man's armsâ'Tis false, 'tis false. You have defam'd my daughterâThat I see, And, by defaming, seek to screen yourself: That I can understandâMy child is wrong'd; And this your charge is false and foul as hell. LADY TRANSIT. George, calm his anger. (To Trevor.) TREVOR. Uncle, hear me speak. FAIRFORD. Aye, and I'm glad you're here, my gallant boy! TREVOR. Lady Le Brun, when I appeal to you, I know you can expound this dark affair; And as I think your motives were sincere In bringing this much-injur'd lady hither, By justifying her you'll clear yourself. LADY LE BRUN. As truly as I can attest to Heaven, That I invited Lady Transit hither For no one purpose but to meet her lord, And seal his pardon,âso can I declare She came for that sole purpose, being told By me expressly, that Sir Charles Le Brun Was gone from Town. For this I had his word; And why he broke it, why he came by stealth, By robber-like surprise (for other name I cannot give it), to insult this lady, Under his own roof, let Sir Charles account; I cannot. LORD TRANSIT. Nor can he devise a tale To overthrow the evidence of sight. I saw my wife encircled by his arms, Claspt in his fond embraceâAghast I stood Rooted with horrorâHe the whilst exclaim'dâ âOh, let my arms support you! Let my breast âBe Beauty's pillow!ââMore he said; but this Will serve his character, the favour'd lover. SIR CHARLES. Lord Transit, when I call'd on you to hear, I wou'd have utter'd from my heart the truth You wou'd not hear: proudly you turn'd away, Threw me your challenge, threaten'd me with death, And thought to force confessions from my fear, Which from my conscience I had freely made. I know the duty that I owe to truth, To innocence, to justiceâand I'll pay it; But not at your command, nor till I see That letter which my wife was pleas'd to write, And sent by Mr. Pliant to your lordship. LADY LE BRUN. Lord Transit, if you have that letter with you, I solemnly adjure you to produce it. LORD TRANSIT. Here is the letterâLet your husband read it. (Gives it to Lady Le Brun.) Pliant enters. PLIANT. Ah! here I am, the source of all confusion! Ah, my sweet lady, if you want to know Who 'twas betray'd your letter to Sir Charles, 'Twas IâI did itâI do all the mischief, And never mean itâThat is my misfortuneâ LADY LE BRUN. And every body's else, that has to do with you. PLIANT. I know it; I acknowledge it for truth. No sooner do I fasten on a man My curst left-handed friendship, down he goes Plump as the whale does when the Thresher rides him. SIR CHARLES. Lady Le Brun, I'm satisfiedâYour letter Does honour to your heart. I ask your pardon. LADY TRANSIT. I now desire Sir Charles will recollect, That I stand here and silently endure Unjust suspicions to attaint my honour. 'Tis time for innocence to speak, when crimes Black and detestable are on the point Of being shifted from their real author, And fasten'd upon me. Sir Charles, confess! SIR CHARLES. If Honour ever harbour'd in my heart, Or Truth e'er found a passage to my lips, 'Tis nowâwhen solemnly I do aver Myself the hateful cause that casts a doubt Ev'n for a moment on that spotless wife, Who, when expecting to receive her husband, Was by my rude, profane assailance struck With indignation, terror, and surprise; And fainting, nay, expiring, as I fear'd, Was so discover'd senseless in my arms. FAIRFORD. Ay, vengeance light upon you! well she might. SIR CHARLES. Now, if my lord has any other doubt, Let him propound it. LORD TRANSIT. You was at the castle, And visited my Lady Transit there The instant I had left it. SIR CHARLES. I was there, And only found admission to your lady On the surmise that I might be encharg'd With some kind message from you; some farewell That look'd like pity, which you never felt. FAIRFORD. There, my Lord Transit, have you heard enough? Will that content you? HEARTRIGHT. Come, no more of this. His heart is wounded deep, and deep enough; Your acids will but agonize it more. Look, look! the load-star that directs his course Beams in your daughter's eyes. See where he moves, And follows as its soft attraction draws, To its safe haven, there to rest for ever. (Lord Transit during this speech fondly advances towards his wife, and in conclusion falls into her arms.) FAIRFORD. There, there! All's over!âHeartright, I cou'd hug you, 'Sdeath, I cou'd strangle you, but that I love you. Oh, you can smileâEgad, I'm pleas'd to see it. HEARTRIGHT. Yes, 'tis a sympathy my muscles have, A kind of trick, when I see others happy. Jests are not apt to move them. FAIRFORD. Nephew George, I won't say much to you. I feel the more. LORD TRANSIT. When Mercy and Forgiveness are gone forth, The moment is auspicious to offenders. May it not then be time for us, who feel And own our imperfections, to prefer The only plea that we presume to urgeâ A zeal to profit, and a wish to please? END OF THE COMEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Will a Hint do for every Husband? No: Here and there one deserves a knock-down blow. The surly chuff, whose malice can abuse His gentle dame, will hardly hear the Muse; Whilst you, whose untir'd patience still survives Our curtain lecture, may endure your wives. But, is the fault for ever with the men? Not alwaysâabout nine times out of ten. Why then, you'll say, do they expound the laws So much in favour of the husband's cause? Why did a certain Judge prescribe a stick, Provided only 'twas not over thick? Aye, why, indeed? I hope that learned brother, When he took one stick, gave his wife another. The sooty Hymen, who beside the Tweed Rivets love's fetters on with holy speed, Case-harden'd as his steel, heeds no complaints, Nor cares what father fumes, what mother faints. His rattling anvil stops Compassion's ears, And the hot forge exhausts his source of tears; Nothing to him, what future ills betide The tricking bridegroom, or the truant bride: When craft and folly play their desp'rate game, If the knave cheats, the dupe must share the blame. But when true love in equal union binds Harmonious tempers and congenial minds,â If Time's cold hand shall wither beauty's bloom, And the gay features deepen into gloom,â That is the husband's sacred hour to prove The strength of honour, and the truth of love; That is the time to guard, support, and raise The drooping partner of his happier days,â Like the firm oak, whose branches wide and strong Shield the fond vine, that clung to it so long: Then if his past experience can impart A Hint to Husbands,âit will reach the heart.</field>
