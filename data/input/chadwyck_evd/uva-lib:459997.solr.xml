      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Arcas to Euribates, who is waiting at the King's Pavilion. EURIBATES. Who's there? Arc. A Soldier, and a Greek, Euribates. Eur. Say what important Care has rais'd you thus Before the Sun, do the Winds swell our Canvass, Shall these Confed'rate Kings, whose valiant Bands Lye here extended on the Strand of Aulis, Leagu'd against Troy, shall they at last Embark, And visit like a Storm that Pride of Asia? Arc. No, no, all Sleep; the Camp, the Fleet is husht, Th'imprison'd Winds without a Murmur rest; And not a Zephyr curls the drowsie Flood. 'Tis a dead Calm. Eur. All rest, but Agamemnon; Distracting Passions rend his mighty Breast, Alone he sits, alone in yon Pavilion, Sustains his Grief, his Hands support his Head, A winking Taper only his Companion; Which now and then just lifts a quivering Flame, And darts a melancholly Gleam around: Thy Heart would bleed to see him. Wert thou sent for? Arc. By his Commands, I wait thus early here: But my Soul feels his Sorrows ere I know 'em. Say what Afflictions have o'erta'en the King, Whom I believ'd the happyest of Mankind? âThe Gods with every Blessing crown his Hopes; A happy Prince, a Father, and a Husband; He Rules in Peace the fruitful Realm of Argos. âDoes the Desire of Power, Ambition fire him? Lo, twenty Kings, our Grecian Empire's Chiefs, Inrol their Royal Names to serve beneath him; And ask his Conduct in this glorious War, Their God in Arms, sprung from immortal Jove. Eur. Repeat his Glories, sum his Blessings up; Recount what late he was, and you shall see From what a height this King of Kings is fall'n. Arc. Was; is he not belov'd, rever'd by all? Achilles courts his Friendship, young Achilles, The Pride of Oracles, and Boast of Fate, The Darling of the Gods, their promis'd Hero, Impatient asks his Daughter Iphigenia, And vows to light his Bridal Torch at Troy. âShe too, the Joy and Wonder of all Eyes, Doubly her Father's Joy, lives in his Heart. I've seen the mighty Monarch drop his Sceptre, While yet her Infant Years, her Infant Manners, Foretold her Virtues, and her Beauty's Progress. I've seen him busily employ'd, and pleas'd To trifle with his Child; attend her Prattle, And watch her artless Smiles; then grasp her hard, And catch her to his Breast; while drops of Joy Came sudden from his Soul into his Sight, And all reveal'd the Father. Eur. Oh no more! You touch his Griefâmy Heart is torn, to think That Iphigenia was his Soul's Delight. Arc. Is she not still the same? has not his Love Increas'd ev'n as her Years; is she not still Dear as his Glory? as his Fame unsully'd? Eur. Attend, and you shall hear the mournful Cause. âYou may remember, Arcas, when our Fleets, Here summon'd by the Winds, hoisted their Canvas, The flattering Gales blew briskly from our Shores To distant Troyâwhile all the chearful Host Stood eager to Embark, and with loud Shouts Proclaim'd their Hostile Joyâwhen suddenly Some Power unseen recall'd the Breath of Heav'n, The busie Air was still, the Waters silent, The flagging Sheet clung to the sturdy Mast, Our useless Oars weary'd the quiet Deep In vain; in vain the hardy Seaman toil'd: Our valiant Cheifs all upward turn'd their Thoughts, To deprecate the Vengeance of the Gods. Sage Nestor, Menelaus, wise Ulysses, Each offer'd at Diana's Silver Shrine Their private Vows, and begg'd a Wind for Greece; King Agamemnon last approach'd her Altar, He bow'd, and paid his Tributary Victim; When lo; the Flame in a thick Cloud of Smoak Was choak'd, the Altar rent, the ample Dome Of the high Temple shook, the frighted Preists Fled from their ChargeâCalchas alone remain'd, And to the prostrate King, with Horror dumb, Thus spoke the Virgin Deity's Decree. âYou Arm against proud Troy these Powers in vain, âUnless a mighty Sacrifice be slain; âUnless a Daughter, sprung from Helen's Seed, âOn chast Diana's holy Altar bleed. âWould you recal those Winds the Gods deny, âAppease the Gods; let Iphigenia die. Arc. His Child! Eur. The Fondling of his Soul, his Daughter. Arc. Immortal Gods! how transient are our Joys! They only serve to heighten our Misfortunes, And give our Minds a quicker Sense of Woe. How did he bear this shock? Eur. Ev'n as a Man. Nature, at once Rebellious to his Will, Fixt him a Statue on the Marble Pavement, His Blood congeal'd; a dewy Sweat distill'd From his pale Faceâwhen thro' a thousand Sighs His broken Accents burstâwith thoughtless Rage He curs'd his rigid Fate; then hasten'd hither, Resolving to dismiss the Troops; since that The Conflict of his Passions racks his Soul. âBehold him, Arcas; see the King, the Father, Alternately contending which shall Rule. Enter Agamemnon from his Pavilion; a Letter in his Hand. Agam. The public Policy demands her Life; Shall I then Sacrifice my Child, or People? They are my Children too; let private Int'rest, Let Nature's Call yield to the general Good; But Nature will return; I am a Man By human Passions sway'd; I feel her Loss, And feel it as a Father, not a King. Arc. Hail to the King of Kings, great Agamemnon. Agam. Yes, she must die; Ulysses has my Word. Hah; Arcas, do the Gods delight in Blood? [To Arcas. Arc. Too deep Reflection wounds your generous Mind, High Heav'n may yet Reverse the dire Decree. Agam. At first the cunning Statesman sooth'd my Rage, And gave the Torrent of my Passion way; But soon the artful Orator appear'd, He represented me a King, a General: Will you, said he, grow old, and rust at Home, In ignominious Ease doat on your Houshold, Or Reign a King; the Sovereign Lord of Greece? âOh I confessâwith guilty Shame I own, Charm'd with my Power, that mighty, sounding Name, The King of Kings, and General of Greece Wrought on the haughty Weakness of my Soul. âYet moreâthe Gods in Dreams pursu'd my Mind, There they reproach'd my sacrilegious Pity, And threaten'd to Avenge their slighted Altars; âThus vanquish'd by the Cunning of Ulysses, And thus attack'd by Heav'nâEuribates; Oh Arcas;âI resolv'd my Child should bleed, I wrote to hasten her Arrival here On this Pretence, that young Achilles press'd To wed her here, before he sail'd for Troy. Arc. Achilles, fir'd with Love and just Resentment, Will never tamely see his Mistress bleed. Eur. Achilles then was absent from the Camp, To check a Neighbouring State's increasing Pride. All thought the War would cost both Blood and Time; But what can stop th'impetuous Hero's Course? Achilles fought, and triumph'd, and return'd, And late last Night rejoin'd our Troops in Aulis. Arc. Has he yet heard the fatal Oracle? Agam. I dare not tell him what the Gods decree. On what shall I resolve? inform me, Arcas. âMy Daughter comes; she comes to meet her Father, Her Father and her Loverâhapless Virgin! She comes to meet inevitable Fate. âI mourn not for her Youth, or that my Blood Glides thro' her VeinsâAh no, my Friend, I mourn Ten thousand Virtues join'd; our mutual Love, Her Piety for meâmy Tenderness for her. âNo, no, I'll not believe it. Heav'n, thy Justice Cannot approve this dismal Sacrifice: Thy Oracles would only tempt my Faith, And my Obedience would be impious here. Arc. Then how will you discharge your solemn Word, Your Promise to Ulysses, that the Day She here appear'd the Royal Maid should die? Agam. Therefore I sent for thee, my faithful Arcas; This Charge will both thy Zeal and Prudence prove. Haste to Mycene, stop my Daughter's coming, Give Clytemnestra this, and let her know My Daughter must not yet prepare for Aulis. Inevitable Death must meet her here; If she appears, no human Art can save her. Haste, save her from the Gods, Oh save her from her Father âStay Arcas, let not Clytemnestra know; Hide from my Child and Wife the fatal Secret: Hurt not their tender Minds with the sad Tale. Oh, Arcas, I am forc'd to feign Excuses, Why I revoke those Orders which I gave; Tell 'em, for so I write, the Son of Peleus, Achilles, cools, and would defer the Rites Of Marriage, 'till he comes from Troy victorious. Tell 'em (so I pretend) the sudden Cause Of this quick Change, proceeds from a new Mistress: The fair Eriphile, his Lesbian Captive, With a new Passion warms the Heroe's Heart. Euribates, attend him, let him know What better may be done, what further said. [Exeunt Eur. and Arcas. But lo, Achilles and Ulysses entring. Enter Achilles and Ulysses. Agam. That you return, swifter than rapid Fame [To Achilles. Can bear your Triumphs on her loaden Wings, I gratulate the Grecian State, and you Her growing HopeâHail Son of mighty Peleus! All Thessaly is conquer'd or appeas'd, And Lesbos new to Chains, a Virgin Conquest, Beholds her youthful, her victorious Lord. Ach. Unworthy Victory! they shamed our Arms, Submitting to their Fears, and left our Valour An idle Gazer onlyâyet ere long A nobler Scene of Glory will appear. Troy; Troy, with all her haughty Towers shall shake, And Hector's Check turn white, when he beholds The loosen'd Winds drive on their promis'd Vengeance Our fearless Bandsâwhile the divided Waves Yield to a thousand ProwsâBut Iphigenia; She, she's the Warrior's Meed: I thank you, General, That you prevent my Wishes; there's a Whisper Runs through the Camp which says, the Queen and Princess Are on their Journey hither; my full Heart Receiv'd the welcome News with Joy, with Transport! Agam. What said you? that my Daughter and my Wife Are on their Way to Aulis, to this Shore? Achil. To Aulis; wherefore are you thus surpris'd? Agam. Good Heav'n, does he too know the fatal Secret? [To Ulysses aside. Ulys. My Lord, the King may justly be surpris'd. Is this, is this a time for Joy, for Love, When a dead Sea strikes Horror thro' our Camp, Diseases waste the Soldier, angry Heav'n Calls for Atonement, Sacrifice and Prayer? And will Achilles, will the Son of Thetis, When every Knee bends to the Gods for Mercy, Will he alone reproach their pious Sorrow With ill-tim'd Joys, insult the publick Grief, And give his Passions scope?âSay, is it fit, At such a time as this, that Agamemnon Urge on the publick Fate with Festivals? âDivine Achilles, yet reflect and feel Your Country's GriefâAnd then your Love for her, Like mine for you, will chide your eager Joy, And say 'tis out of Season. Achil. Wise Declaimer; The Fields of Troas, and Scamander's Flood, Shall witness who's the better Greek, Pelides Or talkative UlyssesâBut till then Load every Altar with a Sacrifice, Open the bleeding Victim's Breast, there guess The Reason of your Fears, there search the Cause Of accidental Ills, and raise new Doubts With pious FraudsâBut, Sir, for me, for me, Who neither know, nor care to know from Juglers, My Joys or Fears, let me pursue a Marriage That neither can concern the Gods nor you. âYet think not that inactive I'll consume My ardent Youth; the Rites of Love perform'd, Then I'll Imbark for Troy, and think I'm wrong'd If any Grecian treads that Strand before me. Agam. Why should the Gods, if Gods can know no Envy, Shut up their Seas, imprison all their Winds, And stop the burning Hero's Course to Asia? âYet so it isâPrinces, we must retire, Each with his Royal Host, and break this League; 'Tis vain, 'tis impious to contend, when Heav'n Declares against us. Achil. Ha! what says the King? Ulys. What means our Chief? Valiant Atrides speak. Agam. Princes, we must retireâLead off your Troops, The Winds too long have weary'd out our Wishes, Abus'd our HopesâHeaven is the Shield of Troy. The angry Gods, by numberless Presages, Forbid our Way to Asia. Achil. What Presages? What Omens shew the Anger of the Gods? Agam. For that consult the Gods; their Oracles Declare your Life's the Price of conquer'd Troy: Yes, Troy may fall, but the young Son of Thetis, Achilles, in the very Spring of Youth; Must pay the Purchase of so dear a Triumph. Achil. And must these Kings, assembled to revenge The Rape of Helen, to revenge your Wrongs, In shameful Inactivity disband, While Paris insolently boasts his Flame, And unchastis'd enjoys your Brother's Wife? Agam. Your glorious Heat anticipates the War; Your Arms have doubly satisfy'd our Wrongs; When swift, as the blue Fire or Bolt from Heav'n, They spread their Horrors thro' th'Ãgean Sea; While the swoln Waters roll'd into the Ports Of trembling Troy, the Wrecks of ruin'd Lesbos, A ravag'd City and a Captive Beauty, Have amply well aveng'd the Rape of Helen: Eriphile, your Pris'ner, vainly strives To hide her noble Birth, her Silence speaks her: In sullen Majesty, with Pride she mourns, Her haughty Grief reveals what it would hide. Achil. Your Arts, your Menaces are vain and weak: 'Tis true, the Fates foretold my Mother Goddess, When she receiv'd a Mortal to her Bed, Her Son might either chuse, with many Years A Life inglorious, or Immortal Fame And Death in blooming Youth.âShall I descend To count my Hours by the slow Waste of Sands? Shall I extinguish all I boast Divine To save my Father's Part in me?âthis Flesh âAway, away.âLet Oracles be dumb; 'Tis Honour calls, Honour's my Oracle; The Hero's Soul knows no Command but Glory; My Life's the Gods, my Honour is my own. âWhy do we vainly vex our selves with Laws And doubtful Tales from PriestsâTo Arms, to Arms. Our Ancestors are Gods, let us pursue The Paths their Virtue ledâshake off this Load, Plunge into deathless Fame, and rise Immortal. âYet Agamemnon, 'tis reserv'd for you; The Action and the Glory shall be yours, I only ask the Honour to obey; Let us prepare for Troy, I'll straight review The sick'ning Troops, And with my Presence raise their drooping Spirits. [Exit Achil. Agamemnon and Ulysses. Ulys. You see he's still resolv'd to sail for Troy. His eager Heart pants after Arms and Glory; Thirsty of FameâWe fondly thought his Love Would hold him backâBut Love inflames the Fire, Provokes and animates his native Ardour. Agam. Oh Iphigenia! Ulys. Wherefore broke that Sigh? Do you yet feel the Pangs of strugling Nature? Call up superior Reason to your Aid, Exert her Force, and loose this Woman's Weakness. Agam. Oh, 'tis a heavy Task, at once to stifle, With our weak Reason, the strong Throws of Nature! Must I then see her bleed, and be deny'd A Sigh; a Groan! I am a Man, Ulysses. Ulys. Think Iphigenia is no longer yours; By solemn Vows devoted to the Gods: Think, when the Grecians know this Oracle, And that you (doating on your Child) refus'd To satisfie the Gods: Whatever Ills, Whatever Plagues, or Heav'n or Nature sends, Will all be charg'd on you; the Priests will urge it, Call you their chosen Curse, their impious Scourge, Remember too your sacred Honour suffers; Honour, a Jewel plac'd in Crowns, to light And animate Mankind to virtuous Glory; Made to distinguish and adorn Desert. Agam. Your Heart, at distance from the Woes I feel, Appears intrepidâMake my Cause your own. Suppose your Son Telemachus to bleed, Behold the fatal Bandage round his Temples, See the Priest leads him trembling to the Altar; Your Child now weeps and turns his begging Eyes On his hard FatherâSee the fatal Knife Directed to his Throatâthis dreadful Image Should make you shudder at the Pangs I bear, And melt your haughty Language into Tears. âEnough of thisâMy fatal Word is given, And if my Daughter comes to Aulis here. Thus I confirm my PromiseâShe shall die, Ulys. See where the King of LacedÃ¦mon comes, Your Brother Menelaus comes in haste, And wears the Weight of Business on his Brow. Enter Menelaus. Mene. Chief among Kings, Atrides, valiant Prince, All hail!âYou have perform'd your sacred Word. The Queen and Iphigenia both are come: They had arriv'd before, but that they wander'd, Lost in those Woods which shade the Strand of Aulis. Agam. Hah! what says my Brother? Mene. In the Camp, Your Daughter, and her Mother Clytemnestra, Receive the welcome Shouts of the glad Soldier; And with 'em young Eriphile, the Lesbian, Comes to Sollicit here her Destiny; And know of our wise Calchas, who's her Father: I think these Beauties have alarm'd us all, For every Tongue is busy'd in a Question, And every Eye is pleas'd with my fair Niece; Some ask the Reason of their Journey hither; While others Pray the Gods long to preserve 'em; But with united Voices they proclaim Your Name aloud, call you their glorious King, Their Leader to immortal Fame and Conquest. Maintain your Character, and let 'em know, Your People are much dearer than your Child. Ulys. He is determin'd now, urge him no farther, We'll haste to Calchas, and prepare the Altar; Our Chief declares, the Gods shall be obey'd. Agam. The jealous Gods have thus secur'd their Vengeance, And broke the secret Wheels of my vain Wisdom. Were I permitted to indulge my Grief, With Tears they might relieve my swelling Breast; Hard Fate of Kings, we are but Slaves in Purple, Expos'd to rigorous Chance, while every Act Is censur'd and condemn'd by vulgar Tongues, Besieg'd with Spiesâwhat an oppressive Weight, Is smother'd Grief; how heavy at the Heart? Ulys. I am a Father, Sir; I too confess The weakness of fond Nature; now I feel The Blow that shakes youâsee, my swimming Eyes Have catch'd the growing Grief from yours, and shed Their social Drops in friendly Consort with you; âYes, while we may enjoy your mighty Sorrow, Weep o'er your dying Childâwe'll aid your Tears. âBut what will Tears avail? no, let us cease This helpless Sorrow; let us mourn in Blood, In Phrigian BloodâLet Hector's swelling Veins Shed purple DropsâThink on your rising Glory; Behold our Ships o'er-spread the Hellespont, And whiten, with their Prows, the foamy Surge! Behold proud Troy in Flames, her Citizens, And haughty Priam bending at your Feet; Helen restor'd, by you restord to Greece; Our Navy now, crown'd with victorious Garlands, Triumphant cut their liquid Way to Aulis; While the bold Trumpets Eccho to the Shores Of distant Greece, great Agamemnon comes: Fame will, from Age to Age, deliver down, And keep alive in her eternal Records, The never-dying Name of Agamemnon. Agam. I yieldâand leave to Heav'n the Care of Virtue: Their Victim shall attend the dreadful Shrine; Let Calchas yet preserve the fatal Secret; Oh, let not Clytemnestra know her Child Must die, cut off in the gay Morn of Life; Hard Fate!âare these my promis'd Hopes, my Joys! Have I for this with Culture form'd her Mind? For this alone, to lose her in her Bloom? The Florist thus, when Winter's Rage is o'er, When Frosts and Snows, and Tempests are no more, To the kind Soil commits the future Flower. Now genial Heats unbind the teeming Root, Swell it with Life, and make the Fibres shoot: He sees the rising Vegetable rear The tender Stalk, and trust it self in Air; Now Western Gales breath thro' the vernal Skie, Unfold the Bud, and shew its various Die, Secure, he views his Labour with Delight; When unexpected, in one piercing Night, His promis'd Joys are curs'd by a disastrous Blight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Eriphile and Doris. Eri. Let us begone, and while that happy Maid Receives her Father's and her Husband's welcome, While Iphigenia, that triumphant Beauty, Possesses every Joy her Heart can wish, Let me retire, thus covetously hoard My mighty Griefs, and keep alive my Sorrows. Doris. Why do you urge your cruel Memory, Oh why provoke it to renew your Tears? 'Tis true, Captivity imbitters Life; Yet when the Victor Homicide in Chains Led you to Argos then you seem'd to bear Less heavily the weight than now; when Fortune And lovely Iphigenia smile upon you. Eri. Think'st thou 'twill mitigate my Pain, to see All smiling Joy around, while I am fixt, Amidst this Happiness, the Mark of Fate? Nor have the partial Gods permitted me To know who gave this Being to a Wretch. And when I ask the dreadful Oracle, When I wou'd search the Source from whence I sprung, It tells me, I shall perish when I know it. Doris. All Oracles in doubtful Meanings hide, Or in dark Mysteries obscure the Truth; Your Name, your Parents are alike conceal'd, And you must wait 'till Time unravels all. Eri. Thy Father, all the Witness I e'er had, Wou'd never suffer me to ask my Birth. But when my curious Tongue inquir'd too far, In Troy, said he, you'll find your Royal Parents; There you'll retrieve your Family and Name: But when I hop'd to visit that fam'd City, Achilles, the fierce Mirmidon, led on His dreadful Troops, and sack'd our trembling Lesbos. And thus I only keep the pompous Name, Of what I ne'er shall prove, a Royal Birth. Doris. We both shou'd hate the Hand that gave the Blow, The pitiless AchillesâCalchas, Madam, Calchas, who knows the Secrets of the Gods, Will soon discover all that you can ask, And Iphigenia's Marriage with the Victor Will both confirm and strengthen your Protection. Eri. Curse on that Marriage! the swift Lightning blast it! That, that, of all my Woes, sits heavy'st on me. Doris. How, Madam! Eri. Doris, thou hast shook my Soul; Attend, and thou shalt hear my countless Griefs, And be amaz'd I bear 'em all, yet live; Captivityâmy Parents lostâmy Countryâ Thy Father's Deathâsit lightly at my Heart. âDespair and Love rack my distracted Soul. Is there a Burthen, Maid, like hopless Love? Yes this Destroyer of Mankind, Achilles, This bloody Author of my Woes, with shame I own is dearer to my Eyes than Light. Doris. Tyrannic Love! where will this Passion end? Eri. I thought to hide in everlasting Silence This weakness of my SoulâBut oh, my Heart, Unable to contain the swelling Secret, Thus breaks a Passage thro' my Eyes and Tongue. Ask me not how, or where, my Hopes were founded; Whether the Hero's Tenderness inflam'd The growing Passion, when he sooth'd my Cares, And with Concern beheld my Chains and Tears. Doris. When was your Heart first sensible of Love, Tell me, how came the cruel Victor there? Eri. Shall I recount the Horrors of that Day, That dreadful Day, when the fierce Warrior's Sword Unpeopled LesbosâSpeechless, void of Life Awhile I layâBut when my trembling Eyes Return'd to LightâI saw the Victor's Hand Had rais'd me from the EarthâHe bad me cease To weepâthe Fair (said he) are ever sacred. I sigh'dâand durst not lift my Eyes, to see His dreadful Faceâhis bloody Hand grasp'd mine; He led me to imbarkâyet still my Eyes Cast down avoided the detested sight; At length I saw him, Doris, I beheld This dreadful Soldier, then I saw Achilles; But, oh, his Form had nothing terrible, I found my Heart, my Tongue, my very Thoughts At once conspir'd, and took the Conqueror's Side. Pleas'd; yes, transported with my Chains, I follow'd My lovely Guide, my glorious dreadful Leader. Doris. Then Iphigenia still attempts in vain. Eri. Yes, Iphigenia courts in vain my Friendship, And loads me every Hour with hateful Favours, She is my Hero's joyful promis'd Bride, My happy Rivalâall her Joysâare Pangs, Are Daggers here, ev'n now they pierce my Heart. Doris. How can your powerless Hate prevent this Marriage? Had you remain'd within Mycene's Walls, You might have combated these struggling Passions. At least, have sav'd a jealous Heart the Pangs Your happy Rival's sight must hourly give. Eri. A secret Impulse carry'd me away, Hurry'd by Fate I cameâIn hopes I here Shou'd heal my Love-sick Mind, and loose my Sorrows: These hapless Nuptials will conclude my Fate. If they succeed, Eriphile must die; The silent Grave will hide my Love and Shame. âNo, Doris, no; they must not, shall not meet, I'll step between their Hymeneal Joys; I'll part 'emâIf Despair, or Jealousie, Or hopeless Love, have any Rage or Power. Doris. Compose your selfâBehold the happy Father, And the more happy Daughter, both appear. Enter Agamemnon and Iphigenia. Iph. Why will you leave me, Sir? Oh, cou'd you see How satisfy'd, with what a full Content My Heart enjoys your Presence, you'd indulge, Yes, you wou'd give a little to my Fondness: Lay by awhile the weightier Cares of State, And deign to waste an Hour with Iphigenia; But now you sigh, and turn away your Eyes, While thus with Joy I run to meet your Blessing. Why are you alter'd thus? Or how have I Offended, that I lose my Father's Love? Agam. My ChildâI love thee dearer than my Life. Iph. Here let me cherish, and with tender Care Preserve that Love; 'tis as the circling Blood That beats in every Vein, my Warmth, my Health. âBut all Mankind are Rivals for your Love; The Grecians Ã¦mulously strive to raise Your Fame, and place you in their highest Honours, Their Princes all obey you; every Blessing Attends your Wish unaskt, and I may now Call you with pleasing Pride my happy Father. Agam. Daughter, you merit a much happier Father. Iph. What is there wanting to your distant Wishes? Your Fame, your Dignity stands high, unequal'd; The brightest Glories that can grace a Throne Are yours, the bounteous Gods can grant no more. Agam. Which way shall I prepare herâOh she sinks My Soul! her Tenderness unmans me; yet I must, âI cannot speakâ Iph. Why do you stop your Sighs? You seem to hide with pain some rising Passion. Have we without your Orders left Mycene? Agam. You never disobey'd me, Iphigenia; Our Joys have always some alloy of Sorrow, And Dignities are ever mixt with Cares. Iph. You shall not know a Care while I am here; Blush not to be a Father for a Moment. What will the Princess say, this Royal Maid, When she beholds you thus neglect my Love? Oft have I glory'd in my Happiness, And promis'd some Relief to fair Eriphile, From Agamemnon's Goodness and Protection. How will she take this cold Indifference? Alas! she sees I have deceiv'd my self With flattering Hopesâ Agam. Oh DaughterâIphigenia! What shall I sayâmy labouring Heart will break. Iph. Give me your Grief, my Fatherâlet me feel And share your Sorrow, whatsoe'er it be. Agam. Ye partial Powers!âOh, give me Strength and Virtue. Iph. Perish th'adulterous Author of this War. Agam. His Death will cost the Conqueror some Blood, Iph. The Gods for ever guard your sacred Life. Agam. The Gods, my Child, are deaf to all our Prayers, Iph. But Calchas now prepares a Sacrifice; They say that Sacrifice will make us happy. Agam. May Heav'n before 'tis offer'd be appeas'd. Iph. When will this Sacrifice be made? Agam. Too soon. Iph. Shall we with mutual Prayers assist the Priest, And jointly offer up our Vows for Greece? Agam. Yes, Daughter, yesâyou will assist the Priest; Yes; you must offer up yourâVows for Greece. [Breaking from Iph. Iphigenia, Eriphile, and Doris. Iph. What can thus shake his Mind? I feel his Fears, And tremble ere I know his Sorrows Cause, Ye never dying Guardians of the Just, Ministring Angels, save, defend the King From this impending Ill, whate'er it be. Eri. Some Business of the State rolls in his Mind And breaks his Thoughts; all will be calm again. If you thus feel imaginary Pains, How wou'd you bear my Burthen; I, who know No Parents, no Protector, no Relief? If Agamemnon shou'd neglect your Piety, Your Royal Mother wou'd repay that loss With double Fondness; if they both forsake you, Your Hero, your Achilles will receive And cherish with eternal Love your Beauties. Iph. Oh fair Eriphile, that Godlike Hero Will soon relieve our Cares, and ease my Heart; His mighty Soul is fill'd with Love and Glory, In Arms he rushes dreadful to the War, Impetuous, rapid as contending Winds, Rough as the wintry Storm that plows the Deep. âIn Peace he mildly drops the boisterous Warrior, Then he's all Love, soft as the balmy Air That gently bends the Herbage, calmly breathes The Morning Sweetsâ Eri. You are all Rapture, Madam. Iph. All Tongues are eloquent, all Eyes are pleas'd, And every Heart is warm'd with Joy to see him, The general Wonder, and the general Love; Yes, he is all that Woman's Wish can fancy, To satisfie her Pride, or please her Eyes. Eri. With what transporting Joy her busie Tongue Dwells on his Praise! 'tis worse than Death, than Shame; Her Words are Tongues of Adders, Tails of Scorpions. [Aside. Iph. His Fame, his Love, my Parents, and my Duty, Gave him the full Possession of my Heart: And now, my Friend, our Lives, like joining Streams, Unruffled by Adversity or Strife, Shall flow into Eternity together. Eri. No, no: I'll raise a Storm shall rack your Peace. Oh Rage! oh Jealousie!âyet hold my Heart, My tortur'd Heart!âCurse on their happy Loves. [Aside. Iph. You seem disturb'd, Eriphile; the Blood Glows in your FaceâWhat has disorder'd you? Eri. A sudden Pain shot like a Dagger thro' me, I thought I shou'd have faintedâPray go on; You say this Lover, this Achillesâ Iph. Yes; Is he not more than half Divine, Eriphile? âAnd yet I wonder he so long is absent. He must have heard of our Arrival here: My jealous Heart fears ev'ry thing, ev'n you, My Father, and AchillesâAll avoid, Or coldly meet my Love. Doris. Madam, your Mother, The Queen appears, the Royal Clytemnestra. Enter Clytemnestra with a Letter. Clyt. Daughter, we must again revisit Argos, Haste, let us fly and save us from Dishonour. I now no longer wonder, Agamemnon Gave us so cold a Welcome to the Camp. [Gives Iph. the Letter. Behold this Letter, which was sent by Arcas, Sent to prevent our Journey; but the Message Miscarry'd, while our Chariot stray'd last Night In Aulis Woods. Iph. Alas! What do I see? He writes us here, the mighty Son of Peleus, [Reads. Achilles cools, and wou'd defer the Rites Of Marriage, till he comes from Troy victorious? Eri. What do I hear? Oh my exulting Heart! [Aside. Iph. And that this Change, this unexpected Coldness [Reads. Proceeds from young Eriphile, his Captive. [Looking stedfastly on Eriph. âOh faithless and unkind! Eri. What can this mean? Am I alive, or is it all a Dream? A pleasing Vision? No; I wake, I live: And yet the Hero never yet discover'd, To me his Loveâhow my Transported Soul Feels the surprizing News! Clyt. Arm, arm your Mind; Oh steel with generous Pride your noble Spirit: I see you Blush, and are concern'd to bear His PerfidyâBut think, my Child, a Soul That can be false, must be unworthy too; Stay not to feel the Shame of slighted Love. Conduct your self, worthy your Royal Birth. The King shall know our Resolution's fixt, For our Departure from the Camp this Night. Madam, we will not press your Company [To Eriphile. Back to MyceneâWe shall leave you here, In better HandsâFalse Maid, we know your Wiles; Your base Designs are now expos'd to Day; It is not Calchas that you seek in Aulis. [Ex. Clyt. Iphigenia and Eriphile. Iph. Yes, Iphigenia, guard thy Fame, thy Honour; Tho' thy Heart bleeds, let him not know thy Weakness; The Tales of faithful Love are Fictions all; Our Fancies work, a fairy Land, a Bubble, That with its borrow'd Lights pleases a Moment, And then expands to empty Air again. Eriphile, you're grown a happy Captive: It seems you hold your Conqueror in Chains. Eri. Madam, this strange Discourse surprises me. Iph. 'Tis I shou'd be surpris'dâbut since you know not, I'll tell youâYou were once my faithful Friend; Eriphile, Fate robs me of a Husband; Will you abandon me, and must I lose A Friend?âNo, no; you will be ever faithful; You wou'd not leave me, when I came to Aulis, My Company was your Delight, your Life: I know you will attend me back again. Eri. I should consult the Priest, before I go. Iph. Consult him thenâand let us go this Moment. Eri. Perhaps my Business here requires some stay. Iph. I will no further press you to be gone; I know your pleasing Business, here in Aulis. Oh, cou'd I ever think Eriphile! Oh, cou'd I ever think Achilles false! Eri. Can you believe I love that furious Man, Who never met my Eyes, but bath'd in Blood? Lesbos in Ashes, Fire, and Flame, and Death, All the dread Storms of War, fore-ran his March. Then when I saw him first, I saw him fierce, Unlovely, terrible, and full of Horrour: Cou'd he then make Impressions on my Heart? Iph. Eriphile, you love this dreadful Man; You know not with what Joy I see you Paint The Hero bath'd in Bloodâthis burning Lesbos, This dreadful Storm of War, this Fire, this Fury, And all the raging Horrors of that Day Which your fond Tongue with feign'd Concerns repeats, Point out the Traces of a settled Passion Imprinted on your Soul:âYour Memory, Pleas'd with his Deeds, preserves the fatal Tale. How have I sigh'd to hear your fond Complaints, And aided all your Counterfeited Grief! You love him.âYes; the bloody Warrior still Dwells in your MindâPerdious! and Unworthy! I see th'ill natur'd Pleasure in your Eyes; Your haughty Looks insult my injur'd Love. Eri. Then let me greatly thus avow my Passion: I love this Demi god, this Man immortal. Who is there, so insensible of Glory, So dead to all Ambition, and the Charms Of Power and Rule, that cou'd resist Achilles? Ask your own Heart, whence sprung these fond Emotions; Did they not lift your Soul, and swell your Breast With extasie, while you believ'd him yours? Forgive me, Madam, while I own a Pleasure Too great to be conceal'd,âYou urg'd it from me. And while you call'd him mine, th'unruly Joy Broke thro' all Bounds, and with uncommon Ardour Grac'd every Motion, spoke in every Look. Iph. DoâGlory in thy Crime, be fond of Guilt; False to thy Friend, and Trustâbe greatly false, And loudly boast thy Shame!âthe Son of Thetis, And false Eriphile, have Hearts alike. Eri. If there's a Joy on Earth, beyond the Rapture Of two united Hearts, 'tis to behold A slighted Rival's Pangs.âYes, my Achilles Is all; he shall, he will be ever mine; I rule with absolute Command his Heart. Iph. Yet oh! remember, insolent, proud Woman, This perjur'd Man will be forsworn again; Remember, I shall see your Hero's Vows Paid to another Shrine,âFor be assur'd, The Man, who once was false, can ne'er be true. Perhaps this Wanderer may return to me: You may, with jealous Rage, behold these Charms Victorious, as my Honour; while with Pride, With virtuous Pride, I see you both despair. For your weak Mind, dispirited with Vice, Knows not the Fortitude to Suffer Ills. Eri. Accuse your feeble Charms, which wanted Strength To Fix a Heart, they only faintly warm'd. My pointed Eyes, with animated Fires, And Force unerring, Conquer'd all the Hero. When I appear'd, your languid Beauties dy'd: My Absence only gave 'em Light and Being. âSo when from Western Hills the burning Sun âDescends, and leaves his Empire to the Moon, âFalse Meteors glare, and scatter'd Drops of Light, âWith glow-worm Spangles, dress the gloom of Night: âBut as the Radiant God remounts his Carr, âThe borrow'd Vapours swiftly disappear; âThey fly the Force of his celestial Ray, âOr their pale Lights are lost in Floods of Day. Iph. Cou'd I believe a perjur'd Lover's Loss Worthy my Care, I might, secure to Conquer, Arm these neglected Eyes with killing Charms; And show thee how thy arrogant, vain Soul O'er-rates thy trifling Form,âBut learn from me, The Virgin's lashing Beauties are her Blushes; And she who can descend t'insnare her Lover, Will lose him when the poor Deceit is known. Yet more to mortifie thy daring Pride; Remember, Agamemnon Rules in Greece. My Father here bears Sway.âYes, your Achilles, And you the Minion of his fond Addresses. May find, that Wrongs like mine demand Redress. Achilles Enters. Eri. He comesâHe comesâthe fluttering Guest within Fears, least her Jealousies should all prove false. âMy doubting Heart is on the Rack: My Life, My Death depends on this important Moment! Achil. Fair Iphigenia, welcome to the Camp. I am surpriz'd with equal Joy and Wonder, To find you, thus unlook'd for, here in Aulis. Iph. Be not surpriz'd, my Lord; I'll soon be gone, [Going. And make your Wonder sink below your Joy. Achil. Illustrious Maid, say how have I offended? [Holding her. You shall not goâGive me to know the Cause Why thy bright Eyes shoot those disdainful Fires, Why all thy Beauties redden thus with Anger; What unknown Crime have I committed?âSpeak. Iph. How hard 'tis to dissemble well, Achilles! I can't so readily relate the Story, Your Lesbian Captive will inform you all. [Exit Iph. Eriphile, Achilles, Doris. Achil. She flyes me! Doe I wake? or is this all Illusion only, and the Sport of Fancy? Alas! I feel it here, I cannot bear it. How have I merited, oh Charming Maid, How has my faithful Heart deserv'd thy Scorn? Eri. Oh Heav'n! He loves her still!âBehold! He sinks, Unable to support her dreadful Anger. Ah short-liv'd Joy! Once more I am undone. [Aside. Achil. Madam, if yet you can behold Achilles, Without remembring he was once your Foe, Permit me to petition you, to know Why Iphigenia meets my Eyes with Scorn. Oh fair Eriphile, if e'er you lov'd, If e'er your tender Hear was sensible Of that soft Passion, think what I endure. Pity, assist me, tell me what's the Cause; For you, I'm sure, must know her inmost Secrets, Th'accursed Cause why Iphigenia frowns Eri. Yes, Sir, my Soul is sensible of Love, And I can pity Lovers fond Distresses. âBut you and Iphigenia both are happy. Achil. How, happy! Did you not regard her Eyes, With what Disdain they shot their beamy Fires? Wou'd she endure my Sight, or hear me speak? Eri. I see your Soul is rapt in Iphigenia. Achil. Eriphile, she rivals my Ambition, Dear to my Soul as the Desire of Fame; Oh she's divinely Fair, divinely Good, More beautiful than the bright Cyprian Goddess, Chast as the Virgin Huntress of the Woods. Eri. Thrice happy Maid, thrice happy Iphigenia, Cou'd she repay with mutual Love this Passion. But know, young Son of Thetis, Virgins Hearts Receive with Warmth and Force their first Impressions. Suppose her Heart engag'd.âWhat if her Duty At first oblig'd her to admit your Vows, While for some happier Youth she still reserv'd The secret Wishes of her Maiden Love; And now she sees these hated Nuptials near She starts, she trembles, and beholds with Horror Th'Approaching HourâPerhaps, these are the Reasons Why she receives you thusâObserve her Eyes, Her Sighs, her Tears; they openly declare, She thinks you the dire Cause of all her Woe. Achil. Hah! thou hast rous'd my sleeping Jealousy. Were all her Vows the cold Effects of Duty? No, no; I'll not believe it, Her chast Mind Is pure and guilelessâthy Suspicion's base. âYet something stirs the Campâthe Grecian Prince Behold Achilles all with hostile Eyes: Ev'n now proud Menelaus and Ulysses Both arm'd their Eloquence to cross my Love. They told me that my Honour too must suffer, If I shou'd press this Marriage with the Princess. What dreadful Enterprize have they in View? Why do they thus obscurely half reveal, What both concerns my Honor and my Mistress? I'll know this Secret; instantly I'll know it: I'll force it from 'em. My distracted Soul Burns in suspense between my Love and Glory. [Exit Achilles. Eriphile, Doris. Eri. Gods, who behold my Shame, conceal it too. Proud Rival, thou hast all my Hero's Love. Must I for ever live to be thy Triumph, Insulted by thy Happiness?âYet tell me, Say Doris, have we yet one Hope?âthere is, A louring Cloud yet blackens o'er their Heads; Yet Iphigenia thinks her Lover false: Achilles is deceiv'd, and Agamemnon Sends from his labouring Bosom secret Sighs. I'll wait th'Event. What, tho' my rigid Stars Shou'd still frown on, Despair will guide my Hand, And Animate my Soul to part these Lovers. Thus when, with jealous Rage, the Wife of Jove Saw his stoln Loves in the Nonacrian Grove, In vain the Conscious Virgin urg'd a Rape, The Thunderer's Power, and Cynthia's borrow'd Shape: Rash Maid, she cry'd, 'tis Criminal to please; Thy Ruin only can my Wrath appease. Thy Beauties shall no more my Fears allarm. The Goddess spoke, with Indignation warm, And let her Vengeance loose on every Rival Charm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. Clyt. Yes, we prepar'd, my Lord, to leave the Camp, The Camp and false Achilles; Iphigenia Felt all the Pangs, that ever lovesick Maid Receiv'd from faithless Manâher Noble Heart Yet struggled to conceal th'unworthy Flame; But Sighs, and secret Tears, and sudden Blushes Reveal'd the sad Disorder of her Mind. âWhen the young Hero, wondring at our Flight, And her Resentment, fell upon his Knees, And fir'd with just Disdain, to hear his Love Prophan'd; Confirm'd it with the warmest Vows, And press'd the sacred Rites might be perform'd, This very Day perform'dâTo your Pavilion He bends his Course, the Marriage must be now, That will for ever silence base Reports. Agam. Enough! I do believe Achilles true. WellâWe'll perform this Marriage instantly. Calchas shall join their Hands before the Gods: But be you absent from this nuptial Sacrifice, And leave to me alone the sacred Care. Clyt. My Lord, I cannot justifie my Absence; I must be there; behold the pleasing Pomp With Transport, see the blissful Union made, And give the blushing Bride to her fond Lover. Agam. You're now not in the Palace of Atrides, But in a Campâ Clyt. A Camp where you Command, Where Asia's Fate depends upon your Arms, Where the great Son of Thetis calls you Father: What Pomp, what Splendor, what Magnificence Can Atreus' Palace give exceeding this? Agam. Now in the Name of those Immortal Gods, Who gave us Being, from whose Race we spring, Grant my Request; Do not attend this Marriage. I have my Reasons why you shou'd be absent. Clyt. How can you rob me of the pleasing Sight? Why shou'd you blush to see your Clytemnestra Give Agamemnon's Daughter to Achilles? Agam. I hop'd I might prevail by mild Persuasion; But since the Force of Reason stirs you not. Know 'tis my Will you come not to the Altar. 'Tis my Command; reply not, but obey. [Exit Agam Clytemnestra alone. Why shou'd the King detain me from the Altar? Am I unworthy, since this Dignity, To share his Honours and partake his Glory? Or does he fear his new unsettled Rule, And dares I not shew the Grecians Helen's Sister? Does he for this avoid me? 'tis unjust He shou'd reflect my Sister's Shame on me, But 'tis his Will, and therefore I obey. Behold Achilles; see th'impatient Bridegroom. Enter Achilles, Achil. All things succeed, and answer to our Hopes. Madam, the King is satisfy'dâHe knows, He sees, he trusts the Transports of my Love: And when I wou'd have spoke to clear my Honour He clos'd me in his Arms, and call'd me Son. The Camp is all in Joy; Did you not hear What Blessings have attended you to Aulis? Clyt. Is there a Blessing dearer to my Soul, Than what I now enjoy in this Alliance? Achil. When you arriv'd, Calchas aloud proclaim'd The Wrath of all the Gods wou'd be appeas'd: Neptune will hear our Prayers, and the loud Winds Be summon'd from their Caverns to our Aid. And now the busy Mariners unfurl Their slackend Sails, and now they wait the Signal To call our Troops on Board, and weigh their Anchors. For me, if Heaven wou'd so indulge my Love, I wish the Winds might not so soon return. 'Tis with Regret that I, so young a Bridegroom, Shall be oblig'd to leave this pleasing Shore. But when the Trumpet speaks, 'tis Honour's Voice, Nor must we lose the glorious great Occasion To punish, to chastise this Ravisher Of Clytemnestra's SisterâAll your Wrongs Are by this great Alliance made my own. Enter Iphigenia, Eriphile, Doris and Ãgina. Achil. to Iph. Oh thou my future Happiness and Life, Illustrious Maid, let us attend the Priest; There, in the Presence of th'auspicious Gods, Profess eternal Unity and Love. Iph. Before we tye this ever-hallow'd Knot, I hope the Queen will suffer me to ask A Pledge of all your promis'd Faith and Love. âI here present before you a young Princess, Heaven on her Face imprints her Royal Birth, Her Eyes have all her Days been wet with Tears. You know her Miseries, she's yours by Conquest; Ev'n I my self, transported with blind Rage, This Morning added to her many Griefs; What can I less than by my readiest Aid Repair the Wrongs she suffered from my Words? She is your Captive, Sir, I ask her Freedom: Begin this happy Day to bless Mankind. Eri. Her Cunning wou'd remove me from his Presence. Oh counterfeited Love!âOh female Friendship! [Aside. Iphi. The Hero does not only draw his Sword To tame and conquer a Rebellious World, But like the Gods, whose mighty Stamp he bears, To succour and relieve th'Unfortunate. Eri. My Burthen is too great for Life to bear. My Lord, at Lesbos I became your Slave; 'Tis too too much to load me thus with Sorrow. The Torments that I here endure are more, Are more than Words can tell, or Tears express. Achil. How Madam! tho' Captivity's a Burthenâ Erip. Cou'd you Impose on me a harder Law, Than thus to make my Eyes mournful Spectators Of all my cruel Foes Felicity? Where-e'er I look I see a numerous Host, Prepar'd with Fire and Sword to sack my Country: This Marriage too strengthens your strict Alliance, And makes our Fate inevitably certain. Permit me then, at distance from the Camp, At distance from this hated Camp and you, To seek some melancholy lone Retreat, Ever unfortunate, ever unknown. Achil. Enough, fair Princess; Follow to the Altar. There, in the sight of the whole Grecian Army, I'll give thee, beauteous Pris'ner, Liberty. That happy Moment which for ever joins My Hand and Heart to Royal Iphigenia, Shall be the happy Moment of your Freedom. [As they are going Arcas meets 'em. Arc. All things are ready for the pious Pomp: The King awaits his Daughter at the Altar. Iâin his Name demand herârather, Madam, [To Clyt. Let me implore your Royal Aid against him. Cly. What say'st thou, Arcas? wherefore dost thou kneel? Arc. You only can defend her. [To Achil. Achil. Against whom? And whom should I defend? Collect thy Spirits, And speak th'important Message fully to us. Arc. I name and I accuse him with Regret; Yet while I cou'd I kept his fatal Secret: But now my Love, my Duty bids me speak. âThe Knife, the Fillet, and the Pyle are ready; Stern Calchas stands prepar'd to give the Blow, While on each side the busie Priests attend, To mix the sacred Wine with flowing Bloodâ Clyt. Why dost thou Pause?âexplain thy self, good Arcas. Achil. Whatever 'tis, speak boldly; fear not, Soldier. Arc. You are her Lover, Sirâand you her Motherâ Oh Save, Preserve the Princess from her Father. Clyt. What dost thou say? Preserve her from her Father? Achil. What shou'd we fear from Agamemnon, Arcas? Arc. He now attends Diana's holy Shrine, And now, ev'n now, expects the Virgin Sacrifice? Achil. Whom wou'd he Sacrifice? [Pointing to Iph. Clyt. His Child! Iph. My Father! Eri. Just Heav'n, what do I hear? Oh Doris, Doris, A glimm'ring Dawn of Happiness strikes thro' The Gloom of my Despair!âMy Rival dies! [Aside. Achil. What frantick Rage arms him against his Child? Thy Story, Arcas, chills my Blood with Horror. Arc. The Priests cry out, the Grecian Empire's Weal, And the whole Fate of Troy, depend on this: Our Oracles by Calchas loudly call For Iphigenia's Blood; the Gods demand her. Iph. Ye Righteous Gods, what is my Crime unknown? Clyt. I now no longer wonder that the King Forbad me to approach these sacred Rites. Eri. Haste, let us fly before 'em to the Altar: We'll see this dreadful pleasing Sacrifice! [Aside to Doris. What tho' the Son of Thetis ne'er be mine, The most Consummate Joy my Soul can taste, Will be to see her forc'd from her fond Hero. Iph. Are these our marriage Rites, Oh my Achilles! Arc. The People think, as first the King declar'd, Our Altars were adorn'd to grace your Nuptials. Clyt. My Lord, thus low before your Feet I fall: Oh let our Tears provoke your ready Aid: She is your Bride; with pleasing Haste she came From Argos, to receive her promis'd Hero. With Tears of Joy you met her fond Embraces: And will her Godlike Master tamely see The Darling of his Soul torn from his Arms? Shall she Embrace their Shrines with Suppliant Hands, And vainly beg the rigid Gods for Mercy? Oh Sir, you are her only Hope, her Help, Her Father, Husband, Altar, and her God. Oh save, defend her from the bloody Priest. You do, you will: I see you feel our Wrongs. I'll instantly attend their horrid Pomp, And know what Oracle has thus proclaim'd My Daughter's Fate; Guard her till I return. If nothing can divert the fatal Blow, The Cruel King shall see me perish with her [Exit. Iphigenia and Achilles. Achil. The Horror of this dreadful Incident Had struck me dumb and motionless; I saw Your Royal Mother bending at my Feet, And begging with her Tears my speedy Aid. âWho has more Interest in your Life than I? Shall Iphigenia bleed, and Thetis' Son With Unconcern behold the Butcher Priest Bath'd in his Mistress Blood?âNo, Madam, No: Repose your selfâI'll answer for a Life Much dearer than my ownâYour Happiness Is interwoven, struck into my Being, 'Tis mingled with the vital Stream that rolls Thro' all this FrameâBut I'll revenge my Wrongs. 'Tis not enough that I defend my Love, No! the Contrivers of this bloody Stratagem, Who durst thus arm my Name against your Life, Shall dearly pay the Purchase of their Fraud. [Is going. Iph. Oh stay, my Lord, and deign to hear me speak. Achil. Inhuman Agamemnon! was not I Prepar'd to vindicate your Sister's Wrongs? Why this Affront to me? this cruel Outrage? I first of all the Princes gave this Man, This barbarous Man, my Suffrage to command: I Nam'd him Chief of all the Twenty Kings Who rival'd him in EmpireâYes, I rais'd, I first created him this God on Earth, And now he levels all his Bolts at me. Iph. Consider yet, my Lord, that Agamemnonâ Achil. My Love, my Anger and my just Disdain Call loudly for RevengeâOh Iphigenia! Had I remain'd one Moment more in Lesbos, Who cou'd have sav'd thee from their bloody Rage? In vain thou wou'dst have sought thy Husband here; For thy Inhuman Father, not content To violate the Laws of Love and Nature, Cloath'd and disguis'd his savage Purposes With the soft Name of MarriageâAs my Bride, He wou'd have led you to the pompous Altar. âGods! I'll be satisfy'dâMy Name's abus'd, The Grecian Princes shall command Redress, And heal my wounded, my insulted Honour. Iph. Alas! if once you lov'd, you wou'd restrain These unkind Words, and ere you speak, reflect, This Barbarous, this Inhuman, Cruel Man, Whate'er he is besides, is still my Father. Achil. No, he has forfeited that pious Name; He's your Assassin now, your Murtherer. Iph. 'Tis with the utmost Pain you wound my Soul, When thus you call him Cruel and Unkind. And wherefore is he Cruel? Why Unkind? Do not his Groans incessantly proclaim The weighty Grief that loads his suffering Mind? What Father thus wou'd lose a Child he lov'd? Oh, I beheld the Tears stream down his Cheeks, When first he found he cou'd not save my Life. âAccuse him not, till you have heard his Reasons. Add not, to all the Horrors of this Day, The Loss of your AllianceâAgamemnon Will satisfie your DoubtsâWhen I am dead, Your Friendship may continue, to reform And bless Mankind; If Iphigenia's Memory Raises a pious Sigh, or kind Reflection, 'Twill be a grateful Tribute to her Love. Achil. How, Madam! then, amidst these Dangers round you, Your Fears are only least you shou'd Offend This Cruel Man! What can I call him less, Who thus demands your unoffending Life? And when I would oppose my timely Hand To stop his Rageâhis Quiet, his Repose, Is all your Care! Oh Rigid and Unkind, Both to your self and meâOh Iphigenia, Does faithful Love merit this cold Return? Iph. Injurious Man, can you suspect my Love? How brightly has it shone? how have I prov'd It? You saw me now receive the dreadful Summons To sudden Death, unshaken and resolv'd. Say, did my Eyes drop one reluctant Tear? Have I yet murmur'd out a Sigh, or trembled? âYet when the News of your Inconstancy Arriv'd, it planted Daggers in my Heart. To what a height did my Despair arise? And when I found you true, what were my Joys? 'Tis therefore, therefore 'tis the Angry Gods Devoted me to Dye; I fondly thought (So greatly, so excessively I lov'd) Immortal Happiness below my Wish. Achil. Oh thou kind tender Partner of my Life, Live for my sakeâlet me Petition thee To save my LoveâMy Soul is bound in thine. Enter Clytemnestra and Ãgina. Clyt. All's lost, my Lord, without your timely Aid; The King with care avoids and fears my Presence; He has refus'd to see or hear me speak; The Guards, by his particular Command, Surround the Altar, and defend each Avenue. Achil. 'Tis wellâthis stubborn King rules absolute. Madam, Atrides shall both see and hear me; I'll open you a Passage through his Guards. [Achilles leading off Clytemnestra. Iph. Yet stay, Achilles: what would you attempt? Oh whither would your generous Passion drive you? Achil. Whate'er you ask against your self is vain; We must oppose you, to protect your Life. Clyt. What wouldst thou, Iphigenia! say, my Child. Iph. Restrain the Passion of a furious Lover; Let not my Father and Achilles meet. Achilles, full of Fire and deep Resentment, Will aggravate his Sorrows with Reproaches. My Father's justly jealous of his Power, And full of HeatâNo; let us gently try By softer Means to work upon his Soul; He'll come himself, surpriz'd at my delay, To lead me, to conduct me to the Altar. Then he'll behold an oppress'd Mother's Grief; I know he'll feel our Sorrows, and remit The fatal Sentence of offended Heav'n. âYet should he still pursue, with Constancy, The dire Decrees aboveâOh my Achilles, I'll ask;âwhat, yet I never did intend, I'll ask, with Tears, my LifeâI'll strive to pay The mighty Debt I owe, and live for you. Achil. Go, plead thy moving Cause, thou suffering Maid, Recal his Reason, his Humanity, His Love, his Duty; say 'tis my Request, For yours, for my Repose, and for his own. âBut if our Words succeed not, we must Act. Madam, I wholly am dispos'd to serve you, [To Clyt. Let me conduct you to your own Apartment. Your Daughter shall not die, you have my Word, Her sacred Life is guarded by my Sword; The Subtle Priests shall find, her Destiny Is not in them, nor in their Gods, but me. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Eriphile and Doris. Eri. No, never, never was my Soul as now Disquieted, and torn with wild Distraction. With envious Eyes I see her glorious Danger, Behold her Great, triumphant in her Woe. Didst thou not mark her Pride, when she perceiv'd Achilles greatly mov'd with her Misfortunes? This Heroe, terrible to Humankind, Who never weakly melted into Softness, Bred in his Youth, and harden'd to Destruction, Who first receiv'd, as busie Fame reports, His Food from Savages, while in a Desart The Infant-God was nourish'd by a Tygress; âYes, he relentedâGods! I saw his Eyes Shed the big Drops; yes, his whole Soul relented, And all the Heroe sunk into the Lover. âWhat Racksâwhat Tortures would I not indure? What lingring Ages of Despair and Death, To draw one Tear from this immortal Man? Doris. Let her enjoy her fruitless Pride, and die. Eri. No, no, she will not die; her haughty Lover, Achilles, will remove all Obstacles. Her gentle Resignation to Heav'ns Will, Her pious Tears, her Heart that bleeds to part With Life and him, and all this Pomp of Grief, Will more indear her to his Soul than ever. Doris. He dares not rob the Altar; haughty Calchat Will arm the People and the Gods against him. Eri. Dost thou not see how cautiously they act? The fatal Sentence is with Care conceal'd, Nor does the Camp yet know their Royal Victim. Yet Agamemnon doubts, and feels his Blood Rebel against the Dictates of the Gods. Oh Doris! how, how will his staggering Mind Sustain th'Attacks of Nature?âhis Wife's Rage?â His Daughters Tears?âand fierce Achilles' Wrath? No, no; the Gods in vain doom her to die. I am, and I alone must still remain Unfortunateâand yet, if I must perish, Why should I fall alone!âit shall be done. Doris. What horrid Image strikes your feverish Mind? Why does your troubled Fancy raise new Terrors? Eri. I'll instantly proclaim, through all the Camp, The Gods demand their Victim, Iphigenia, That still their impious King keeps back the Sacrifice; That dreadful Vengeance waits to punish all For Agamemnon's SacriledgeâI'll blow The murmuring Soldier into mad Sedition. Doris. Think cooly, Madam, think what Consequence. Eri. Troy will inrol my Name among her Gods, And all her Domes breathe Clouds of grateful Incense, If thus I can disturb their Peace, thus break Their strong Alliance, cherish their Divisions; Arm proud Achilles against Agamemnon, And turn their sharpen'd Points to civil Fury. Doris. I apprehend your rash Design; but see Where Clytemnestra comesâlet us avoid her. Eri. Yet Doris, let us still with care consult What further must be done to make secure This Sacrificeâ'tis pleasing to the Gods; 'Tis seconding and aiding their Commands. [Exeunt Eriph. and Doris. Clytemnestra and Agamemnon meeting. Agam. Why, Madam, are my Orders disobey'd? I sent by Arcas, to demand your Daughter; Do you with-hold her from the sacred Rites; Why will you still dispute my just Commands? Clyt. Sir, you shall be obey'd; but is there not Some kind fore-warning Power that moves within you, And bids you wish these Rites might be delay'd? Agam. The sacred Shrine is dress'd; the Priest prepar'd. Clyt. But where's the VictimâCruel Agamemnon. Agam. Hah!âthen the fatal Secret is reveal'd. Clyt. Come forth my Child, attend your pious Father; Enter Iphigenia, and kneels to Agamemnon. Kneel, kneel, and thank him for his tender Love; He comes himself to lead you to the Altar. Agam. Rise, IphigeniaâWherefore dost thou kneel, And weep, and sigh? Why are thy mourning Eyes Dejected, fix'd on Earth? Oh! 'tis too plain, Arcas, perfidious Arcas, has betray'd me. Iph. Complain not, Sirâyou shall not be betray'd, Your Will shall be submitted toâI'll dye. My Life is yours, you but recal your own. With the same Heart contented and resign'd, With which I thought to find my promis'd Lord, You shall behold your Victim meet the Blow. Agam. Fairest Example of exalted Virtue: Oh glorious Maidâmy Child, my Iphigenia! Iph. And yet if this respectful Love, this Duty Appears to Merit any Recompence; Might I not wishâsurrounded thus with Honours, Not to be torn away by sudden Death? So sudden, I can hardly say, Farewel; Or call you by the much lov'd Name of Father. Yes, I have been the Pleasure of your Eyes. Once prodigally kind you lov'd your Child; How ofen have you held me in your Arms, And thank'd the Gods in transport for the Blessing? Nor wou'd you blush to own the honest Weakness; âOh, with what Joy, what Fondness wou'd you hear My Infant Tongue presage your glorious Battles; How often did I then foretel the Fate Of haughty Troyâand dress my Victories In childish EloquenceâI little thought That I must first fall by my Father's Hand, And pay with Agamemnon's Blood the Triumph. Agam. Oh, why dost thou repeat this moving Tale? Iph. Not that I fear the Blow, or shake at Death, Do I remind you of your former Goodness; My Heart is truly jealous of your Honour. Believe me, were my Life alone concern'd, I wou'd not thus recount your former Love; Nor wound you with the tender dear Remembrance, âBut on my Fate, the Weal, the Happiness Of an indulgent Mother's Life depends: And that brave Prince, the Godlike Son of Thetis, A Prince who might, if the just Gods had pleas'd, Have given new Honours to your deathless Name: For your permitted me to hear his Passion, And favour all his faithful Vows of Love; He knows your Purpose, be the Judge your self, How his unconquer'd Spirit beats and rages, Lost in a wild of Passion and Despair. âOh Pardon, Sir, these strugglings of my Soul, To save a tender Mother and a Lover. Agam. Daughter, 'tis true; I know not for what Crime The mighty Gods ask from our House a Victim,; But you are pointed out; the Blood of Helen Must stain their Altars, and prevent their Judgments: âOh think not, Iphigenia, that my Love Waited 'till you petition'd for your Life. What have I not endeavour'd to preserve you? This Morning I recall'd those fatal Orders Which summon'd you to Aulisâbut in vain. Some Power unseen broke thro' my weak Attempt, Deceiv'd the Care of an unhappy Father, Who impiously protects what Heav'n condemns. Iph. Let us then yield to Heav'nâlead on, my Father, The Gods and Agamemnon ask my Life, âLead onâ'tis impious to contend or grieve. Agam. Greatly resolv'dâOh thou brave Child of Virtue, In thee our high Alliance with the Gods Shines forth;âyet I applaud with Pain, With Torture, thy Heroic Resolution. âWe must obeyâthe dreadful Hour is come; Go then, resign thy dear important Life, To intercept the Vengeance of the Gods, Least it shou'd fall on Greeceâthere let 'em know 'Tis Agamemnon's Blood that saves his Country. Clyt. Inhuman you confess your guilty Race, Sprung from the Blood of Atreus and Thyestes: Is this the happy pleasing Sacrifice, With so much Care, such Artifice prepar'd? Think'st thou with Tears to moderate thy Crime? This Oracle it seems calls for her Life. Will Heav'n be honour'd by a barbarous Murther? âIf for the Crime of Helen, Helen's Race Must bleed; recall Hermione from Sparta: Let Menelaus with his Daughter's Life Absolve, and so redeem his ravish'd Spouse: This Helen, who disturbs Europe and Asia, Is she a Prize worthy your great Contention? A shameless Woman; Theseus stole her first From LacedÃ¦mon, long ere Menelaus Espous'd her: Yes, we all have often heard Calchas declare, a Princess then was born By that stoln Marriage, who is still unknown. Agam. Wilt thou presume with Arguments to stop, Or contravert the Dictates of the Gods? Against high Heav'n, our Reason and our Power Are weaker than autumnal Leaves, blown off And scatter'd by the WindsâVain Arrogance. Clyt. It must not, shall not be; no, Agamemnon; I will preserve my Child, or offer up A double Sacrifice to angry Heav'n. âYes, Iphigenia, if I cannot save thee, The cruel King shall never part us more, For if we must not live, we'll dye together. [Exit Clytem. leading Iphigenia. Agamemnon alone. Just Heav'n! why am I not divested, stript Of Nature, Reason, and Humanity, And harden'd to perform your bloody Laws? Oh, wherefore have I yet a Father's Heart? 'Tis too too much;âAnd yet Heroic Virtue Is wrought in Fire, and he must bravely bear The Storms of Life, who works his Way to Glory. Enter Menelaus. Mene. Oh, Son of Atreus, haste and save your People, Your Glory, and your Duty to high Heav'n: Calchas, incens'd at your Delays, demands Why you detain the Victim of Diana. New inauspicious Omens fright the Priests, No other Sacrifice will be receiv'd; The lockt-up Winds do yet refuse their Aid. Oh, think your lingring Army here must perish, Must perish all; our Wrongs be unreveng'd. Agam. Oh, Menelaus! Brother! Helen's Rape Will amply be reveng'd; the rigid Gods O'er-rate yon Asian Towers; tho' Victory Crown all our Toils, the Victor is undone. âMust Iphigenia dye for Helen's Crime? Is Virtue made the Martyr of Dishonour? Men. Not for the Crime of Helen, but the Wrongs Of Greece, we armâhad they return'd, or punish'd The lawless Ravisher, they had not broke The sacred Laws of NationsâNor had then These glorious Chiefs assembled here in Arms, Drawn forth in dreadful bright Array of Battel? âWhy are those awful Powers above concern'd To give our Arms Success? why do they ask This spotless Victim, but to purifie The Grecian Camp, and give a Wind for Troy? Agam. Wherefore shou'd Iphigenia's Life aloneâ Men. What Blood is worthy chast Diana's Altar, But Iphigenia's? Who but Agamemnon Shou'd vindicate his injur'd Subjects Wrongs? Oh, King of Men, which of us wou'd not bleed To save, or to augment his Country's Glory? Agam. Oh, dangerous heighth! oh, Glory to be pity'd! Men. Away, Atrides; think no longer; Act. We climb on high with Labour, the Ascent Is steep and arduous to consummate Virtue. Agam. Shall I then, Menelaus, must I see The Butcher Priest, surrounded by the Croud, The barbarous Multitude, slaughter my Child, Open her bleeding Breast, and while the Heart Yet beats, with Horror see the streaming Blood Gush in tumultuous Torrents from the Wound? While with erected Eyes, and crimson'd Hands, Calchas consults the Gods, grown exorable, And satiated with Blood, inclin'd to Mercy. Men. And can your obstinate, hard Disobedience? Can all your Fears, or Menaces, or Arms, Now Heav'n demands her Life, preserve your Child? Agam. Suppose these Priests abuse the Name they Worship. At first Beasts only bled, now Human Gore. With frequent Sacrifice distains their Shrines: In holy Leading-strings the Infant Bigot, Like the devoted Brute, follows his Priest, And bleeds, to magnifie the pious Pomp. O Luxury of Pride!âOh impious Pagentry! Men. Take heed of impious Thoughts; when Heavenly Wrath Descends in sweeping Plagues, and thins your People; When you and all your Race, to future times, Accurs'd, shall groan beneath its Iron Rod; It will be then too late to call for Mercy. Agam. It may be soâPerhaps th'offended Gods, To satisfie their Justice for my Crimes, Command her DeathâPerhaps the subtle Priests Have forg'd this rigorous SentenceâOh, my Soul! How shall I act?âthe struggling Passions meet, Distract, divide, and tear me from my selfâ âNow pleading Nature strikes my Soul with Horror, And cries aloud; O murther not thy Child, By a too hasty Zeal and credulous Fear! âAnd now the Conscience of my Royal Duty, And what I owe to Greece, returns, and checks My tender Fear, and calls it Sacrilege. âImmortal Orb! bright Source and vital Spring! [Kneeling. Diffusive Being!âAnd thou, Father Jove, Father of Gods and Men, inlighten me, That I may know and execute thy Laws. Men. I see your Nature's stirr'd, I see, I feel With you, your Soul is fond of Iphigenia. Ayam. In her I had laid up Treasures for my Age, And hoarded Joys to bless the calmer Evening Of busie LifeâI know no other Comfort: Let me confess a Father's Weakness to thee: [Falls on Menelaus's Neck, and weeps. Support me, Gods!âNow all my Soul is open, Oh, let me thus, thus let me speak her Loss! âBut 'tis the Will of Heav'n, and I obey: I know you'll say these Tears are most unmanly. I've doneâAnd yet 'tis the last tender Debt I e'er shall pay her pious Love and Duty. Men. Now, on my Soul, the Chords of his big Heart Are tortur'd on the RackâOh, Son of Atreus! Think you are yet a King, supreme of Men. Agam. Had I been bless'd with humble Poverty, Freed from this Yoak, this haughty Yoak, Ambition, And cover'd by Obscurity from Danger, I had possess'd in Peace my Iphigenia. Merciless Gods! take back your Purple Glories, Strip me of Subjects, Titles, Power and Rule: Oh, give me only, give me to preserve My virtuous Child! Men. My flowing Eyes, my Heart, With Sympathic Sorrow feel thy Grief: Let all our Wrongs be unreveng'd; for mine I give 'emâI release 'em to thy Sorrows: âRepose your selfâWe will at least defer This bloody SentenceâI'll return in haste To Calchas, and oblige the angry Priest To wait a second Order from the Gods: Yet we shall gain one Day, and that improv'd, With ardent Prayer, may soften or avert The Wrath of Heav'n, and save your Child and Honour. Agam. Words are too poor to thank thee; haste my Friend, Intreat good Calchas, too severely good, That till to Morrow's Sun revisits us, He will defer this awful Sacrifice. Mene. Calchas this Morn seem'd much concern'd, and mourn'd This dreadful unrelenting Call of Heav'n. Agam. Haste then and try to move him; tho' I doubt it; The Pity of that Priest is Cruelty; His pious Zeal mourns and destroys at once. In Ãgypt thus, from the fermented Mud, The genial Sun raises a monst'rous Brood; Th'amphibious Wonder quits his watry Den With hideous Rush, and sweeps the trembling Plain, Destroys all round; yet then with pious Tears He mourns, he murthers, weeps, but never spares. [Mene. and Agam. part. Agamemnon meets Achilles. Achil. My Lord, an idle Rumour flies abroad; It hardly yet has gain'd on my Belief; 'Tis said, (it shakes my Soul when I repeat it,) 'Tis said that Iphigenia dies this Day By your CommandâThat, deaf to all the Cries Of Nature, of Humanity and Blood, You will your self deliver her to Calchas; That she was summon'd in my Name to bleed, And that these Nuptials only were suppos'd, To blind and cover the detested Purpose. Agam. Oh, what a Season has he chose t'insult [Aside. My tortur'd Heart, and load me with Reproaches? Achil. What am I now to think?â'Tis for your Honour To silence these inglorious base Reports. Agam. Young Prince, I never render an Account Of what I doâor publish my Designs. My Daughter has not yet my last Commands; When she's inform'd, if it concerns the Camp, Or you, you'll know my Pleasure in your Orders. Achil. I know too well your barbarous horrid Purpose. Agam. Then wherefore do you ask me what you know? Achil. Why do I ask?âOh, Heav'n! can I believe That thus you dare avow your barbarous Zeal? My Faith, my Love, my Honour must oppose you. Agam. But you, who thus in Menaces pronounce Your haughty Will, forget to whom you speak. Achil. 'Tis you forget my Loveâ'Tis you forget; Achilles neither does, nor suffers Wrongs. Agam. And who committed, Sir, this Trust to you? Which way are you concern'd to interpose Between my Honour and my Family? Say? Am I not her Father? Or are you Her Husband?âWhence this busie Insolence? Achil. By Heav'n she's mine, intirely, wholly mine: Your Word has made her so, and this right Hand Shall guard my sacred Title to her Heart: Did she not come to Aulis, to conclude, By your Command, this Marriage? Faithless Man! Agam. Complain of Heav'n, be angry with the Gods; Accuse their Priests, the Camp, the Grecian Princes; Accuse Ulysses, Menelaus, Nestor; But first and chief of all, accuse your self. Achil. Oh, give me Patience, Heav'n! am I concern'd? Do I partake in your unnatural Guilt? Agam. Yes you! Who, grasping at yon Eastern Conquest, Murmur'd at Heav'n and this destructive Calm. And when I would have here dismiss'd the League, You spread th'infectious Fury thro' the Camp, And ruin'd all my labour'd Care to save her; For then you only talk'd and thought of Troy, Conquest and TroyâHaste thenâPrepare to sail: Her Death opens our CourseâGo satisfie, If ought can satisfie, your mad Ambition. Achil. Gods! must I suffer! must I bear all this? And dare you add, to all your Perjuries, The boldness to impose on me your Crime? Agam. Keep down your swelling Heart; and know that Pride, That fiery Thirst of Fame, has ruin'd all; My Child is sacrific'd to your Ambition. Achil. For me! For my Ambition!âBut I'll curb This rising Heat, and reason cooly with you. âTell me thenâTell me calmly, Agamemnon, Which way was I concern'd for Helen's Rape? Why, from the peaceful Fields of Thessaly, Have I led on my faithful Mirmidons, Deaf to the Voice of my Immortal Mother, And careless of my dying Father's Words? Why do I fondly seek that Destiny, To which they say I am foredoom'd in Troy? What Fleets have sail'd from swift Scamander's Flood To pillage Thessaly?âWhat Ravisher Has stole my Wife or Sister from Larissa? Agam. 'Twas not for me you arm'd, but Asia's Empire. Achil. Barbarian! Am I not in Arms for you? Why do those Troops cover th'extended Strand Of Aulis?âBut to vindicate the Wrongs Of injur'd Hospitality and Loveâ âAnd shall I see the Mistress of my Soul Torn from my Bridal Bed, and not revenge Her Wrongs and mine?âOr will you, can you think, That Menelaus only holds the Right To justifie his injur'd Love and Honour? For me the beauteous Maid mourns her hard Fate, Her Life is mineâher Happiness my Glory! To her my Vessels, Soldiers, Arms, my self, Are all ingag'dâAnd not to Menelaus; Let him pursue, let him redeem his Wife, And gain a Conquest, which the Gods proclaim Is to be purchas'd only with my Bloodâ âI know not Helen, Priam, Hector, Paris; Bright Iphigenia is the sacred Prize I claimâthe Prize I will for ever guard. Tho' Human Race rise in embattel'd Hosts, To force her from my ArmsâOh, Son of Atreus! By that Immortal Power, whose deathless Spirit Informs this EarthâI will oppose 'em all. Agam. Hence thenâReturn to ThessalyâDraw off Your PowersâAnd by your Absence, let us gain Order and DisciplineâGo, Leave the Camp; I disengage, I free you from all Ties To me, or to my DaughterâBy the Gods, We shall have Heros numberless to fight For injur'd Greeceâtho' the proud Son of Thetis Be never heard of moreâTroy will afford Immortal Laurels for the Victor's Brow, And Dangers worthy the brave Warrior's Toil: For you, I find we should have dearly bought Your haughty AidâBut who created you The Arbitrer of Greece?âAway, rash Youth, Give Laws to Slaves, command your Mirmidons, They'll march, and bend, and tremble at your Nod; Hence then, and let your Subjects feel your Rage; I ask less Courage, Sir, and more Obedience; I break, I cancel thus the sacred Bonds That held us in Alliance. Achil. Thank those Bonds That tie my Hands, and now, even now, restrain My RageâYou are my Iphigenia's Father, Or else, by Jove, Immortal Jove, I swear, This Chief, this boasted Chief of twenty Kings, Had never brav'd the Son of Thetis more! But I am CalmâRemember, Agamemnon, I have my Love, my Glory to defend; And when you aim at Iphigenia's Life, The bloody Passage only lies thro' mine. [Exit Achil. Agamemnon alone. Agam. Thy Folly has destroy'd what it would save; My Daughter was too powerful while alone Thy Love; thy Insolence has ruin'd all, And hastens the dire Blow that thou would'st stop: I must not pauseâNo, I must meet his Force; My Glory thus is thrown into the Ballance; Achilles' Threats have fix'd my wav'ring Heart, My Pity now wou'd seem th'Effect of Fear. âEuribates. Enter Euribates. Eur. My Lord. Agam. What would I do? Can I at last pronounce these bloody Orders? Troy, Victory, Revenge, the Grecian Welfare, Are promis'd the Rewards of my Obedience: But all these Glories, these triumphant Laurels, Must spring from Iphigenia's Blood alone. âShe shall not dieâI yield to Love, to Nature; Nor will I blush to own my generous Pity; But then Achilles, arrogantly vain, Will claim the Merit of his haughty Rage; Yes, he'll believe I give her to his Threats, And tremble at the Terror of his Arms. âNo, no, I'll humble the proud Mirmidon; He loves herâShe shall liveâBut not for him; I'll give her to anotherâLet his Rage, His Jealousie redoubleâHaste, Euribates, And let the Queen and Princess both attend me; Bid 'em dismiss their Fears. [Exit Euribates. âOh, righteous Heav'n! If yet, if yet it be your rigid Will, My Child should die, I know my fond Endeavours Are weak and powerlessâBut forgive my Love, That forces me to wait till 'tis confirm'd, Till you demand your Victim once again. Enter Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Eriphile, Doris, Ãgina, Euribates, and Officers. Agam. Go, Clytemnestra, go, secure her Life; I render you your Daughter, take her hence, Remove her far, far from this fatal Shore; Arcas commands the Guards that shall conduct you: I have remitted his OffenceâThis Charge Demands your Secresie and Diligence: Neither the busie Priests, nor yet Ulysses, Suspect our Purposes; be swift and silent, Conceal her so, the Soldiers may believe That I retain her hereâWhile you alone Return to ArgosâGuards, attend the Queen. [To Officers waiting. Clyt. Oh, Sir! Iph. Oh, Royal Father! Agam. No Words, no Thanks; we must not part in Form. Haste; fly; prevent the speedy Call of Calchas; I'll favour your Escape, and feign some Reasons To make him, for one Day at least, suspend The fatal PompâFarewelâThe Gods defend you. [Exeunt Clytemnestra, Ãgina, Euribates, and Officers at one Door, and Agamemnon at the other. Eriphile, Doris. Eriph. This, this way, Doris, let us follow 'em. Doris. Where would your restless Passion hurry you? Eriph. I'll instantly reveal their Flight to Calchas: The Priests, the Princes, and the People, all Shall know their FraudâWhat, shall she live to hold Achilles in her Arms?âWhile I despair. Distracting Thought! it is not to be born: Thou know'st not half the Torments I endure. The restless Stone, the Vultur, and the Wheel, Whate'er the Damn'd, or the Despairing feel, The sharpest Punishments of angry Jove, Are all contain'd at once in jealous Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter Iphigenia and Ãgina. Iph. Away! Return to my distracted Mother. Behold, the mighty Gods will be obey'd, They vindicate their Claim; didst thou not see The general Camp in Arms oppose our Flight, While all their glittering Javelins pointed round us Deny'd a Passage, and repuls'd our Guards? What, shall I wait till the licentious Soldiers Drag their Unwilling Victim to the Shrine? âMy Father tooâAlas! tho' Heav'n remits The fatal Sentence, he demands my Life. Ãgi. Your Father! Iphigenia? Iph. Yes, the King. Achilles has offended him, and I Must punish the brave Prince with my Disdain; Thus I am doom'd a double Sacrifice. He sent by Arcas to explain his Wishes, That I wou'd ne'er receive Achilles more, Or favour with a Word that faithful Lover. Ãgi. What, not One Word, One tender last Farewel, E'er the sharp Steel divides you both for ever? Iph. Ah Cruel Sentence!âRigorous Cnmmand! The Gods, more gentle, only ask my Life. Dye then;âObey;âBut see, Ãgina, see, Achilles comesâSupport me, or I faint. [Rests on Ãgina's Arm. Enter Achilles. Achil. Haste, Iphigenia; Follow me your Guide; Fear not the Noise of those tumultuous Crouds, Which gather round the Tent in pressing Swarms; Appear, and you shall see those dastard Troops Open before our Arms a ready Passage. Patroclus, and some chosen Leaders, wait To Execute whate'er Commands I give. My Troops all watchful, ready to their Arms, And rang'd beneath their Standards, wait my Orders. My bold Thessalians, wedg'd in close Array, The firm Embody'd Phalanx, Foot to Foot, And Target lock'd in Target, shall oppose The Barrier of their Ranks invincible. From that Assylum who shall dare to Force thee? âWhat! dost thou only answer me with Tears? Already hast thou try'd their feeble Aid. How did they move th'inexorable Father? What other hope, what help canst thou expect? Iph. I have no hope, but from that Mortal Blow, Which will for ever end my Hopes and Fears. Achil. Cease, cease this melancholy Talk of Death Think how we are oblig'd; how both engaged: Oh think, if nothing else can move your Heart, My Happiness depends upon your Life. Iph. Your Happiness depends upon my Death. Consider yet what Harvests of full Fame The Goddess Victory presents your Arms; Those glorious Fields, which your aspiring Soul, Impatient for the War, burns to possess, Are barren, if not sprinkled with my Blood: Such is the Law of Fate; so to Atrides The Gods, the People, and the Priests proclaim. âFarewel, brave Prince; thank those immortal Powers, Who thus remove that fatal Obstacle Which barr'd your Arms, and check'd your rising Glories. Achil. I'll hold 'em bothâMy Mistress and my Glory Divide my SoulâNor Gods nor Men shall part us. Iph. Go, signalize this promis'd Grecian Hero, Turn all your Vengeance on your Country's Foes. Priam is pale with Fear, all Troy alarm'd, Shakes at my Nameârepays your Grief in Blood, And drops a Citizen for every Tear. âTho' Heav'n denies me what of Earthly Blessings My Heart cou'd most desire, to live your Bride, I shall dye satisfy'dâwhen I believe. My Deathâthe Source of your Immortal Glory, Will open to the World the Deathless Hero. âOnce more FarewelâFarewel, immortal Man, Worthy the Godlike Race from whence you sprung. Achil. I cannot, must not take this dreadful Farewel. In vain with artful Words you strive to elude My tender Love, thus obstinate to die. How can my Fame be built upon your Ruin? These Laurel Harvests, Honours, Conquests, Glories, Are all preserv'd in saving her I love. With what Contempt will all the Grecian Princes Regard my Arms, when they behold me suffer, With Coward Tameness, this most horrid Rape? My Love, my Glory only live with you: Trust to my Guidance, let me guard and lead you [Offering to lead her. Iph. What? shall I then Rebel against my Father? I shou'd deserve the Death I strove to shun. Oh where wou'd be that Duty, that Obedience? Ach. 'Tis due to me, your promis'd LordâYour Husband I boast that glorious TitleâAgamemnon Shall never rob me of the sacred Promise. Canst thou, severely Dutiful and Just, Refuse Obedience to thy Father's Will In this alone; and yet with rigid Piety Receive his absolute Commands to die? [Takes her Hand. âHaste, the Time flies, my Princess; and I fearâ Iph. Achilles, wou'd you force me from my Duty? Warm'd with the guilty Transports of your Love, You know not how you load my suffering Heart. Away, rash ManâMy Glory and my Honour Ought to be dearer to you than my Life. âIf this seems Cruel, Oh forgive a Wretch Oblig'd to Laws which all the Just obey. âI have been Guilty but to hear you speak; Oh carry your unjust Success no farther, Lest I should fall, shou'd bleed by my own Hands, To free my self from these Extremities, These dangerous Succours which your Love presents. Achil. 'Tis well!âno more! Obey their bloody Call: Haste, satisfie your strange Religious Glory. âHah! since for Human Sacrifice they thirst, The Funeral Pyle shall float in human Blood, The lying Priests shall fall the foremost Victims: I'll Sacrifice a Hecatomb of Priests. Their Temple too shall flame; the Hive and Drones Consume at once.âAnd while the mingled Blaze Shoots thro' the Vaulted Dome, I shall behold, My Vengeance full, and riot in Destruction. âWhat is not lawful to Despair and Rage? And if, amidst these Horrours, these Disorders, Your Father too shou'd perish in the Croud, Know 'tis the Effect of your too rigid Duty; Your obstinate Obedience ruin'd all [Exit Achilles. Iphigenia alone. Iph. My Lord! Achilles, Oh ReturnâHe's gone. Determine, ye just Gods, my Life and Fears: Let all your Vengeance be compleated here. Enter Clyt. Ãgina, Euribates, and Officers as Guards. Clyt. Yes, I'll oppose the World to save my Child. What, Traitors, would you then betray your Queen? Eur. Command us, Madam, you shall see us die To prove our FaithâBut what can we perform Against those numerous Crouds that pour upon us? 'Tis not the Rage of a disorder'd Rout; The Camp is all inflam'd with fatal Zeal; Calchas commands, Calchas is King in Aulis. Atrides, dispossess'd of all his Power, Yields and is born away by the swift Torrent. Achilles, tho' Unconquerable, here Will find the Work too mighty for his Courage. Clyt. Here let 'em point their impious Zeal on me, Take the Remainder of a wretched Being; Yet I'll defend her Life, I'll grasp her hard, And in the Pangs of Death, protect and save her. My separating Soul may leave this Body, But never part from herâOh! my dear Child, [Seeing her. Do I behold again my Iphigenia? Iph. What Cruel Planet rul'd my mournful Birth? Why was I born to aggravate your Sorrows, And make you feel th'extremity of Woe? âYet let us learn with patient Meek Indurance To bear our FateâOh, Clytemnestra, think, How vainly we contend with Gods and Men. Would it avail me, to behold my Mother Left to the Rage of a Rebellious People; And with unworthy Treatment drag'd about As a Despiser of the Gods and Justice? Goâlet the Greeks perform their pious Work? And leave, for ever leave this bloody Shoar. My Funeral Pile will soon in Flames arise; That dreadful Sight must break your tender Heart. âBut one Word more, the last Request I make, I beg you by your Loveâby your Indulgence, Reproach not my dear Father with my Death. Clyt. What, shall I not reproach thy Murtherer? Iph. He gave me to your Fearsâthe Hand of Heav'n Stopt his Endeavours, and restrain'd our Flight. Clyt. Oh, how the cruel King deceiv'd my Hopes. Iph. He but restores the Gods that Life they gave: Alas! my Death cannot deserve this Grief. Your mutual Loves have yet a living Pledge; Orestes, young Orestes, my dear Brother; Oh, may he prove (not like his hapless Sister) The Comfort, the Support of all your Sorrows! [Shouting within. Hark! the loud Peoples Voice impatient call Their Victim forthâFarewelâFarewel for ever! [Embracing. Euribates, lead to Diana's Temple. [Ex. Iphigenia. Clyt. I'll follow her; unhand meâYes, we'll die TogetherâWherefore do these Traitors stop me? [Guards advance their Javelins at Clytemnestra. Here, plunge your Jav'lins, strike 'em to my Heart, And satisfie your burning Thirst of Blood. Enter Ulysses. Ulys. Where would you run?âWhere would your pious Rage Find its Relief?âReturnâand calmy hear What Comfort your Afflictions may admit. Clyt. Curse on all Comfort! and on him that brings it. Ulys. If you would curse, curse that malignant Serpent You nurs'd within your Bosom, false Eriphile; Eriphile, whom you conducted hither, Reveal'd your Flight to the whole Grecian Army. Clyt. Oh, Monster! whom MÃ¦gÃ¦ra, Hell and Night, Ingender'd to destroy my Peace and Comfort. Ulys. Your Grief mistakes its Mercies for its Judgments; Is not the Glory of the Grecian Arms, Supported by this pious Offering? Clyt. Revenge me War, ye Winds, ye Seas, revenge me! Oh, punish 'em with Plagues, with Fire and Sword! Make all their Princes Slaves in Foreign Lands, There let 'em eat the Bread of Care and Sorrow, And linger out in Chains the Days of Shame! âAnd thou, Eternal Orb, who once before Stopt in thy Course, shot from the bright Horizon Thy rising Beams, disdaining to behold Or light that horrid Banquet of Thyestes; Here, here again, the dreadful Son of Atreus Prepares another Feast of Blood and Horror. âWithdraw the DayâLet utter Darkness dwell For ever here, and hide their impious Murther. But now, ev'n now my Child is crown'd to Dye, The fatal Garland's wreath'd about her Temples; Her Father leads her up, the Priests receive her. Merciful Gods! prevent the coming Blow. Ah! now she bleeds! the fatal Wound is given! Farewel, Farewel for ever, Iphigenia! [She sinks into the Arms of her Attendants, and they bear her off. Ulys. Support her hence; as she revives, Ãgina, With gentle Words relieve her heavy Griefâ [Exeunt. Ulysses Alone. The People are fermented by the Priesthood, And will be sick 'till they are cur'd with Sacrifice; The zealous Ideots must be curb'd by Zeal. Our feeble Maids, like Children in the Dark, Create the very Mischiefs that we fear. Suspicion, Melancholly, black Despair And numerous Ills, which our weak Minds o'erbear, Are oft the gloomy Fruits of superstitious Fear. SCENE the Inside of a Temple: At the Upper End an Altar, the holy Fire burning, &amp;c. Iphigenia at the Lower End of the Stage in white, the sacred Fillet round her Head, adorn'd with Flowers, her Hands bound: Agamemnon next his Daughter: Menelaus, Nestor, and Ulysses, on the same side. On the other side, Eriphile, Doris, Arcas, and Euribates, Priests; a Chorus on each side the Altar, and Calchas behind it. CHORUS. We Bend, Diana, to thy Shrine, Spotless Goddess: Power Divine, All Nature shall with us thy Praises join. CALCHAS. You who at the Altar bow, Waiting for the dreadful Blow, The fatal Word shall soon be heard. Diana's Priests, is all prepar'd? CHORUS. All's prepar'd. CALCHAS. Hence ye Prophane, far hence be gone: Our sacred Rites are now begun. Diana's Priests, let this be done. CHORUS. All is done. CALCHAS. Then let every hallow'd Tongue Assist us in the solemn Song. CHORUS. Behold, Diana, thy Commands we wait; Thy Power is shown in Iphigenia's Fate. By her untimely Fate, we learn to know Nothing but Death is certain here below. [After the Vocal Musick, a solemn Call by Instrumental Musick to the Altar. Agamemnon leads up Iphigenia, and as he delivers her to Calchas, a sudden Darkness as if the Day were eclips'd; it Thunders and Lightens, and Calchas comes forward, and speaks. Cal. Whence, and what mean those inauspicious Omens, Sinister all, and adverse to our Vows? The Planet of the Day withdraws his Beams, And reddens as he sinks; while thro' the Gloom Pale Meteors dart their subtile Fires: The Gods In dreadful Thunder speak; the shaking Earth Is torn with strong Convulsions; Nature trembles. âOh, Virgin Goddess of fair Chastity, Let us again consult thy sacred Oracle. [Thunder again. Eri. Oh Doris, a cold Sweat stands on my Brow In Beds of Dew; each tortur'd Sinew shakes With sudden Horrorâwhence this Agony, Now when my promis'd Hopes are all in view? Why do they not perform these bloody Rites? How slow the Drones proceedâNow Doris, now Calchas comes forward, now my Rival diesâ Cal. Hear, hear, ye Grecians; 'tis the Goddess speaks, [Now the Fire on the Altar suddenly breaks into Flame. By me she speaks; my labouring Bosom swells; Enthusiastick heat warms every Nerve: Hear her Commands, and live: thus she declares Her Will, she thus explains her Oracleâ A Princess sprung from Helen's Blood, by Theseus, [Looking stedfastly on Eriphile. Is destin'd for the Victim of this Day; Another Iphigenia, whom her Mother Conceal'd in LacedÃ¦mon, here must bleed. I saw, I saw my self their stoln Embraces, I saw the Fruit of their unlawful Loves; Then I foretold her dreadful Destiny. In vain wer't thou disguis'd, Eriphile, Under that borrow'd Name; the Rage of Heav'n With fatal Impulse drove thee on this Shore. âLo, where she stands! see, she confronts our Eyes! Seize, seize, ye holy Ministers, the Victim: [Two Priests offer to seize her. With pious Zeal approach Diana's Shrine, And expiate with her Blood the Crimes of Greece. Eri. Stand offâno nearer, as you love your Safety, Or I shall die your whiten'd Robes in Crimson. What? shall the Blood of Hero's be prophan'd By vulgar Hands?âNo! thus I Rob your Altar: Thus, thus I bleed the Victim of Achilles. The Son of Thetis strikes the pointed Steel Thro' that fond Heart, which only liv'd for him. A noise of Swords without. Enter Achilles, Patroclus, and Officers with Swords drawn. Achil. Where are these pious Murtherers, these Priests, That thirst for Blood, for Blood of Innocents, And on the Gods impose their barbarous Crimes? Destroy, Patroclus, cut 'em from the Earth. Agam. Restrain your AgeâBehold, all gracious Heav'n Has sav'd our Iphigenia; see, she lives. [Interposing. Achil. Oh my Soul's Joy and Transport! do I hold thee Once more? And shall I live to call thee mine? What interposing God redeem'd thy Life? âWhat do I see? Eriphile!âand bleeding! Agam. The Goddess has reveal'd her Will by Calchas; Eriphile's the Victim Heav'n demanded. Eri. Take, take Libation from the Royal Veins Of TheseusâConsecrate your nuptial Joys In Helen's BloodâHah! my Prophetick Soul Looks downwardsâand behold my rising Vengeance. I see the cursed House of proud Atrides Falls by it selfâbehold, the King of Kings Bleeds by the Partner of his Bed and Throne. Now mad Orestes, with his Mother's Blood, Expiates his Mother's Crimeâthe Gods pursue him. Haunt him, ye Furies, seize his guilty Mind, Let Love, Despair and Love urge him, like me, To seek Relief from inexpressive Tortures In an untimely Grave. [Dies. Iph. See, see, my Lord, she dies; Oh hapless Maid! Men. Oh virtuous Iphigenia! Her Joys are dash'd with Sorrow for her Rival. Agam. Oh Prince! oh glorious Youth! this joyful Day, The Gods have fought the Cause of Love and Virtue; Receive her then from Agamemnon's Hand, A just Reward of the most generous Passion. Achil. Oh Father! General!âmy bounding Heart. Leaps at the Gift, transported, and inlarg'd; May this august Alliance never break, May we pursue the Paths of virtuous Glory, 'Till our great Acts, like Theseus, Hercules, Or Castor, Lift the Grecian Name to Heav'n. [Shouts. Ulys. Hark! the loud Winds are free, the joyful Sailors Welcome the springing Breeze, and in glad Shouts Eccho their ThanksâAway, to Troy, to Troy. Agam. Hence let us learn none can be truly happy, But they who constantly obey the Gods, Who firm to Virtues Laws, strive to excel In all her Works, and labour at Perfection. Oh Virtue, Daughter of Immortal Love! Bright Image, Representative of Jove; For thee we pant, to thee with active Fires, Unclog'd by Flesh, the lab'ring Soul aspires; There she finds Rest, whatever Lot is given. A brave Submission raises her to Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. WILKS. While we, by Verse, and powerful Numbers, Charm The savage Mind, and Passion's Rage disarm; Words are too faint to speak the pleasing Pain, That strikes the Soul, and pierces every Vein. Letters, by Time and slow degrees refin'd, Imbellish'd Life; and smooth'd the rugged Mind: While yet the World to polish'd Arts was new, Greece from the distant Nile her Learning drew; In time, Rome's conquering Eagles proudly bore The Grecian Muses to the Latian Shore; From thence they pass'd the barrier Alpes, to shine. In colder Climates, water'd by the Rhine: In Britain next the Julian Standards rose, And we were cultivated first by Foes: Where e'er the Tow'ring Roman Virtue mov'd, Whate'er their Legions conquer'd, they improv'd. Long has this Island been the Muses Seat, And Cam and Isis their belov'd Retreat; Old Chaucer whileom tun'd his Gothick Chime, And first subdu'd our stubborn Prose to Rhyme; Shakespear and Spencer next enrich'd our Tongue; And Dryden finish'd what they labour'd long. Our Author backward looks with grateful Eyes, And on his Fathers Shoulders strives to rise; Anxious to please, he now revives the Dead, And raises Iphigenia's mournful Shade; From Grece, and France, with equal Care and Toil, Transplants her to Britannia's happy Soil: Athenian Maids, two thousand Years ago, With weeping Eyes beheld this Virgin's Woe; Attend; and you may drop a generous Tear, Blush not that suffering Virtue is your Care; Indulge the rising Sorrows in your Breast; 'Tis great to Grieve for Innocence distrest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. CIBBER, and Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD. Criticks, a Truce: 'Tis true, I just now dy'd: What then! why now I walk, and so you're satisfy'd, For Form, I could have meal'd my Face, and chose In Peals of Thunder through the Stage t'have rose; But troth! I had rather spoil the Jest, than dawb my Cloaths. A Hole but two Foot wide! Sure Bays must doat! I'm ribb'd with nine wide Whale-bone Yards of Petticoat. Beside, my own way (take my Word's) as good, I full as well shall please in Flesh, and Blood: Thus having fairly told you my Condition, I now proceed to open my Commission. Know then, a friendly Shade from Realms below, To you, that live, I'm sent a Plenipo, To warn both Sexes to reform their Lives, As Lovers, Husbands, Virgins, or as Wives: For, when I tell your Punishments reserv'd, You'll rue the Hour, that e'er from Truth you swerv'd. As for Exampleâ W'have got a Prude, you've seen that Box adorn, Who with her Lovers Merit rais'd her Scorn, And now (to shew to what her Ghost is fated) Sh'as nine plump Daughters by the Man she hated. Coquettes, and Beaux innumerable, Swarm; But they (dear Souls!) do very little harm, Living and Dead the same; the happy Elves Unrivall'd still love nothing but themselves. Just as with you, in ten Days after Billing, Bright Goddess proves a Fury; Swain a Villain. In every other State we differ far, 'Twere endless to be so particular, Therefore in gross, 'tis proper you should know, All Vices are revers'd with us below. Young Heirs are Sharpers there; late Sharpers, Culltes; Our Soldiers Stock-job, and our Cits are Bullies. Our Rakes turn Puritans, our Courtiers Quakers, And Aldermen most furious Cuckold-makers. Merit's so sure to Thrive in our dark Nation, And to relieve Distress so much the Fashion, Ev'n States-Mens Hearts are mov'd by soft Compassion. Our Priests are humble, and our Lawyers honest, Our Great Menâpay such Debtsâyou'd be Astonish'd! Poets you'll own much better pass their Time, For all our Bills of Cash are drawn in Rime; Each Bard's a Banker there, and Fancy coins Our Standard Bullion in Immortal Lines: But since, while here, this Passive Author must His Muse's Value to your Judgment trust, If on Poetick Fame too fast he draws, Pay him at least Subsistance in Applause. FINIS.</field>
