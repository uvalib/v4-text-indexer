      <field name="fulltext">The Scene. VENICE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Enter Malipiero, who knocks at a Doore, to him a Servant. Mal. Where is my Uncle sirra? Ser. Not within. Mal. Come hither, tell me truth. Ser. Hee's gone abroad. Mal. He has commanded your officious rogueship. To deny him to me. [Mal. kicks him.] Ser. What do you mean sir? Mal. To speak with my Uncle sirrah, and these kicks Shall fetch him hither. Ser. Help. [He runns in] Mal. Your howling will Be his kue to appear. Enter Cornari. Cor. What insolence is this? Mal. No insolence: I did but correct your knave, Because I would not lose my labour sir, I came to speak w'ee. Cor. Shall I not be safe Within my house? hence. Mal. I ha not done yet. Cor. You were best assault me too. Mal. I must borrow money, And that some call a striking; but you are My very loving Uncle, and do know How necessary it is, your Nephew should not Want for your honor. Cor. Hence; I disclaim, And throw thee from my blood; thou art a bastard. Mal. Indeed you do lie Uncle, and 'tis love, And reverence bids me say so, it would cost Dear, should the proudest Gentleman of Venice Have call'd my Mother whore, but you shall onely By the disbourse of fifty Duccats take My anger off, and I'le be still your Nephew, And drink your health, and my good Aunts. Cor. Drink thy Confusion. Mal. Heaven forbid your Heir should so Forget himself, and lose the benefit Of such a fair Estate as you have Uncle; Shall I have Gold for present use? Cor. Not a Zechine. Mal. Consider but what Company I keep. Cor. Things that lie like Consumptions on their Family, And will in time eat up their very name; A knot of fooles and knaves. Mal. Take heed, be temperate, A hundred Duccats else wil hadly satisfie, The Dukes own Son Signior Thomazo wo'not Blush to be drunk sir in my company. Cor. He is corrupted Amongst diseases like thy self, become His Fathers shame and sorrow, and hath no Inheritance of his noble nature. Mal. You Were best call him bastard too, the money I modestly demanded, and that quickly, And quietly, before I talk aloud, I may be heard to'th Palace else. Cor. Thou heard? i'le tel thee, Were treason talk'd, I believe thy testimony Would hold no credit against the hangman, but I lose too pretious time in dialogue with thee, To be short therefore know.â Mal. Very well, to'th point. Cor. I will consume all my estate my self. Mal. You do not know the waies without instruction. Cor. I will be instructed then. Mal. I doe like that, Let's joyn societies, and ile be satisfied; Let me have part in the consuming of The mony, that does mould for want of Sun-beams Within your musty Coffers, I'le release you. You have no swaggering face; but I can teach Your very lookes to make a noyse, and if You cannot drink or game, wee'l ha' devices; You may have whores, I that but live in hope After your death, keep twelve in pension, They wear my Livery, I'le resigne the Leverets, I can ha more, I have a list of all The Curtezans in Venice, which shall tumble And keep their bugle bowes for thee dear Uncle, Wee'l teach thee a thousand waies. Cor. It shannot need, I shall take other courses with my wealth, And none of you shall share in't. I have a humour To turn my mony into Hospitalls; Your riots come not thither. Mal. But we may, Drink, and diseases are the waies to that too, But will you turn a Master of this Colledge You talk of Uncle? this same Hospitall? And lay out mony to buy wooden leggs For crippl'd men of War, invite to your cost Men that have lost their noses in hot service? Live and converse with roten bawdes &amp; bonesetters, Provide Pensions for surgery, and hard words That eat like Corrosives, and more afflict The patient? but you'l save charges, I consider My Aunt, your wifeâ Cor. How darst thou mention her With thy foul breath. Mal. May be excellent at composing Of Med'cines for corrupted lungs, impostumes At making plaisters, dyet drinks, and in charity Will be a great friend to the pox. Cor. Thou villain. Mal. And you'l be famous by't, I may in time As I said before, if lust, and wine assist me, Grow unsound too, and be one of her patients; And have an office after in her houshold To prepare lint, and searcloths, empty veines, And be controller of the Crutches, oh The world would praise the new foundation Of such a Pest house, and the poor soules drink Your health at every Festivall in hot porredge. Cor. Art thou of kin to me? Mal. I think I am, As near as your brothers eldest Son, who had No competent estate from his own parents. And for that reason by wise nature was Ordain'd to be your heir that have enough Uncle. The fates must be obeyed, and while your land Is fastned to my name for want of males, Which I do hope, if my Aunt hold her barrennesse You will never bang out of her Sheaf, I may Be confident to write my self your Nephew. Cor. Thou hast no seeds of goodness in thee, but I may find waies to cross your hopefull interest. Mal. You'l find no seeds in my Aunts parslybed I hope, and then I'm safe, but take your course, Supply me for the present, for your honourâ The Duccats come. Cor. You are cosened. Mal. As you would not Have me pull down this house, when you are dead And build a stewes, the Duccats come. Cor. Thou coward! Mal. Because I do not cut your throat, that were The way to disinherit my self queintly. Cor. Canst thou not steal? &amp; so deserve a hanging? Mal. Yes I can, and am often tempted, but I wo'not Do you that mighty wrong, to let what you have So long, and with so little conscience gathered, Be lost in confiscation by my fellony. I know a way worth ten on't; yet thus much I'le bind it with an oath, when I turn thief, Your Gold shall be the first I will make bold with, In the mean time lend me the trifling Duccats, And do not trouble me. Cor. Not a Muccinigo To save thee from the Gallies. Mal. No? the Gallies! Must I shift still? remember, and die shortly I'le live, I will, and 'rather then not be Reveng'd on thy estate, I will eat roots Course ones I mean, love, and undoe an herbwife With eating up her sallets, live and lap Onely in barly water, think on't yet, I am now for wine, you know not what that heat May do, the injury being so fresh, I may Return, and you'l repent. Cor. 'Tis more then I Can hope of thee, go to your rabble sir. Mal. You a Gentleman of Venice? but remember, A pox 'a your wealth, I will do something To deserve the halter, that I may disgrace The house I came on, and at my Execution Make such a speech, as at the report, thou shalt Turn desperate, and with the remnant of My Cord go hang thy self, and that way forfeit All thy Estate when I am dead, i'le do Or this, or something worse to be reveng'd. Exit. Mal. Enter Servant. Cor. Hee's lost, this doth new fire my resolution; See if your Mistris be yet ready sirra, Say I expect her. Exit Servant. My blood is almost in a fever with My passion, but Claudiana may cure all, Whom I have wrought with importunity To be spectator at the exercise This day 'ith Academy, here she comes, Enter Claudiana. Art ready? Clau. Ever to obey you sir, But if you would consider yet, you may Be kind, and let me stay, I dare not think You are less careful of my honor, but You gave once Command with my consent too, Not to be seen too much abroad. Cor. I did. I must confesse Claudiana, I had thoughts And scruples which thy innocence hath clear'd, And though our nice Italian every where Impose severely on their wives; I should Be unjust to make thee still a prisoner to Thy melancholly Chamber, take the aire, 'Tis for thy health, and while I wait upon thee, Thou art above the tongue, and wound of scandall. Clau. I know your presence takes off all dishonor, Butâ Cor. No more, I charge thee by thy love, And to convince all arguments against it; I have provided so, thou shalt observe Unseen the bold contentions of art, And action. Clau. I'm not well. Cor. I shall be angry If my desires be plai'd withall, pretend not With purpose to delude me, I have blessings Stor'd in thy health, but if you practise any Infirmity to cross my will, that almes At the security of thy health and honourâ Clau. Sir, you shall steere me. Cor. This becomes Claudiana, I will thank thee in a kiss, prepare The Gundelo. Ser. It waites [Within] Cor. And I on thee, The treasure of my eyes, and heart. Exeunt. Enter Roberto, Ursula, Georgio. Rob. Where is my son Giovanni sirra? Geo. Hee went two hours agoe to the Academy, To see the exercise to day. Urs. How's that? What business has he there, pray 'mongst Gentlemen? He does presume too much. Ro. Patience good Ursula. Urs. You give him to much reine; 'twould become him To follow his profession, and not look after Those gentlemanly sports. Ro. No tempest wife, No thundring Ursula, am not I the Dukes Chief Gardiner, ha? and shall I make my Son A drudg; confine him here to be an earth-worm, Live like a mole, or make it his last blessing To plant, and order quickset; let him walk, And see the fashions. Urs. He has cost you sweetly To bring him up, what use had he of learning? What benefit, but to endanger us, And with his 'poring upon books at midnight, To set the house on fire, let him know how To rule a spade, as you ha done. Ro. He does so, And knowes how to inoculate my Ursula, My nimble tongue, no more: because he read The story of Zantippe to'ther night That could out-talk a drum, and sound a point Of War to her husband honest Socrates, You took a pet; he shall abroad sometimes And read and write till his head ake. Go to Urs. So, so, the Dukes Garden shall be then Well look't to, he deserves a Pension, For reading Amadis de gaule, and Guzman, And Don Quixot, but i'le read him a lecture. Ro. You will? offer but to bark at him, And I will send him to the University To anger thee, nay he shall learn to fence too, And fight with thee, at twenty severall weapons Except thy two edged tongue, a little thing Would make me entertain a dancing master, Peace, or I will destroy thy Kitchin Ursula, Disorder all thy trinkets, and in stead Of brasse and pewter, hang up Violl de Gambos, I'le set an Organ up at thy beds head, And he shall play upon't: what tyrannicall To thy own flesh and blood, to Giovanni? My heir, my onely boy? fetch me a taylor, He shall have new cloaths, and no more be warm With the reversion of your peticoates, Do not provoke me, what imperious? Get you in, or I will swinge you go, and weed. Vrs. Now for vexation could I cry my heart out. Exit. Ro. Sirra stay you, and is Giovanni gone To'th' Academy saist? Geo. Yes sir, they say, There is an English Gentleman, that winns The Garland from 'em all at every exercise, One of the Court told my young master on't, (As he enquired of every Gentleman Comes in to'th' Garden, what's the newes abroad) Ro. And does he not tell thee tales &amp; dainty stories Sometimes? Geo. Oh, of Tamberlain, and the great Turk, &amp; all His Concubines, he knowes 'em to a hair, He is more perfect in the Chronicles Then I am in my prayers. Ro. I do believ't Geo. And talkes a battell, as he were among 'em, He tickles all your turbants, and in a rage, Wishes he had the cutting of their Cabbages To shew what house he came on. Ro. Ha my boy! Geo. Oh sir he has a pestilent memory, He told me to'ther day there was another World in the Moon, and that the world we live in Shines like to that, to people that live there, How many miles it is about the Earth, How many to the starrs, I fear he will Be mad, if he read much, 'tis just like ravening, And such hard words would choak me to repeat 'em. Ro. He never tells me this. Geo. We are familiar. You are his Father, and he dares not lie To you, to me he may talk any thing, He knowes my understanding to an inch. Would you would speak to him though, to take a little More paines, 'tis I do all the droile, the durtwork: When I am digging; he is cutting Unicornes, And Lyons in some hedge, or else devising New knots upon the ground, drawing out Crowns And the Dukes armes, Castles and Cannons in 'em, Here Gallies, there a Ship giving a broad side, Here out of turfe he carves a Senatour With all his robes, making a speech to Time That grows hard by, and twenty curiosities, I think he meanes to embroider all the Garden Shortly, but I do all the course-worke; here's My Mistris agen. Enter Vrsula. Ro. What, is the storm laid? Vrs. I must be patient: your sonne's not come yet Ro. Why now thou art Vrsa Maior, love thy whelp, And we are friends. Vrs. Was not the Dukes Son here? I fear he is sick, that I have not seen him These two daies in the Garden. Geo. There's a Gentleman. Vrs. I, there's a Gentleman indeed. I dream't on him last night, pray heaven he be In health, I prethee make enquiry, There's a Gentleman, and you talk of a Gentleman. Geo. Signior Thomazo? Ro. Where is hee? Geo. I know not, but my mistris would send me To know the state of his body. Ro. Why, how now Vrsula? sirra about you businesse, And spare that inquisition, what hath Your impudence to do with the Dukes Son? Vrs. Have not I to do that gave him suck? I hope I was his nurse, and it becomes me To enquire of his health, he is the very pearl Of curtesie, not proud nor coy I warrant you, But gentle as my Sunday muffe. Ro. Your conny skinne. Vrs. I am the better when I look upon him, There' a gentleman, and you talk of a gentleman, So compleat, so affable, a scholar too, If I could understand him, prethee sweet heart, Get me with child that I may long a little. Ro. For a piece of the Dukes Son? Vrs. I shall nere forget how pretily He took the niple, and would play, and prattle himself Asleep I warrant you, but hee's now a man, A great man, and he remembers me still: There's a gentleman, and you talk of a gentleman. Ro. The woman dotes. Exit. Enter Marino meeting Candiano a Senatour. Mar. Whither so fast? Can. To the Academy. Ma. Spare Your hast, all's done. Can. Who has the vote to day? Mar. The English Gentleman is still victorious All praises flow upon him, he ha's depos'd Our City, which hath now resign'd her Lawrell. Enter Florelli and other gentlemen. Can. Is not this hee? Mar. The same, in's face the promise Of a most noble nature. Flo. Gentlemen, Pray give me leave, to understand your language, For this, so much above me, scarce will be, (When I'm lesse ignorant), worth my thanks. 1. Gent. This is We know pretence of modesty, we must Congratulate your triumph. Flo. For this time I'le be content your praises shall abuse me. Who are these? Mar. Friends and Honorers of your worth. Flo. I see that courtesie is native here, All the reward I can return, must be To speak abroad the Noblenesse of Venice For so much grace to an unworthy stranger. Can. The Duke himselfe. Enter Duke, Thomazo, Senators, Malipiero. Du. We must resolve to send new forces And speedily, the flame will else endanger Venice it self. Sen. This town lost will encourage The insulting Genowese. Du. Thomazo! Tho. Sir. Du. I look when you will ask me leave to traile A pike, and purchase honor in these Warrs. Tho. I have not been well since I was last Let blood, and therefore if you please, I would Be excus'd till the next warrs, and then have at 'em, By that time I shall be a better rapier man. Du. This fool is the dishonor of my blood, He declines all that's noble, and obeyes A base and vulgar appetite, he dwells Like a disease within my name, but 'tis Heavens punishment, what are they? Mari. All strangers, but among them one In whom you may read something worth your grace, An English Gentleman. Du. He, to whom fame Gives the honor of our exercises, nature With such an active heat might have built up My Son, but hee's curst to live a shadow, Marino fetches Florelli to kiss the Dukes hand. Welcome sir to Venice. Tho. He shall kiss my hand too, I am the Dukes Son. Flo. You honor me. Du. Thomazo give that gentleman A box 'oth ear. Tho. He wo'not take it kindly, He is oneâ Du. Will strike agen, is not that it? Tho. I would not use a stranger so discourteously, or elseâ Du. Embrace him then, and make your self worthy of His friendship and converse, you'l gain more honor Then the empty title of your birth can bring yee: But to the great affair; the War, your Counsells. Exeunt Duke, Senatour and Marino. Tho. My father bids me embrace you sir. Flo. I shall Be proud when I can do you any service. Tho. Gentlemen, pray know me every one, I am the Dukes Son, my name's Signior Thomazo. Gent. You do us too great honor. Mal. We had no object worth our envy sir Till you arriv'd, you have at once dishonored, And made our Venice fortunate. Tho. Malipiero, let's bid 'em welcome in rich wine. Mal. I attend you sir. This fellow must not live to boast his trophees, He may supplant me too, if he converse Too freely with Thomazo, whose course wit Is all the stock I live by, please you gentlemen To walk. Gent. We follow. Tho. I would not have the way But that you are a stranger. Gen. it becomes you. Ex. Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Enter Cornari and Claudiana, as in the Duke Garden. Cla. I I have obey'd you sir. Cor. Thou hast done well My Claudiana, very well, who dare Traduce thee for't? am I not carefull of thee? I prethee give me thy opinion Who deserv'd best of all the gentlemen? Cla. I have not art enough to judge. Cor. But thou Hast fancie, and a liberall thought, that may Bestow thy praise on some or other, tell me If thou hadst been to give the garland, prethee Whose head should wear it? though wee ha not judgement To examine, and prepare our justice; yet Where men contend for any victory, Affection may dispose us, and by some Secret in nature we do still incline To one, and guard him with our wishes. Cla. I hope This is but mirth. Cor. By my regard to thy. Fair honor, nothing else, it shannot rise To a dispute, who ha's the vote to day Of all the gentlemen? I must know. Cla. They are To me indifferent. Cor. So is my question, but I must have more, It cannot be but some man must deserve More print and poize in thy opinion, Speak as thou lov'st me Claudiana. Cla. Sir, Your inquisition is not without change Of lookes upon me, and those smiles you ask with, Are not your own I fear. Cor. Nay, then you dally, And undoe that obedience, I so much Commended. Cla. Dear Cornari. Cor. Yet agen? The man, tell me the man? Cla. What man? Cor. The gentleman That best deserves in thy opinion. I shall be angry: what deny to give me This triviall satisfaction? the expence Of a little breath? why do you tremble so? Cla. Alas, I know not what to answer, this Must needs engender fears in my cold bosome, That my poor honor is betrai'd, and I Stand in your thoughts suspected of some guilt I never understood, if the report Of malice have abus'd me to your ear, (For by your self I am all innocent) Cor. What do you mean Claudiana? Cla. Sir, your question Hath frighted me, 'tis strange, and killing to My tender apprehension. Cor. Y'are a fool To be thus troubled, and but that I know The purity of thy faith to me, this language Would make me jealous, 'tis an ill dress't passion, And palenesse, that becomes not Claudiana To wear upon her modest cheek, I see Thy heart sick in thy eyes, be wise, and cure it, My question was but mirth, without the sence Of the least scruple in my self, or meaning To discompose one chearfull look. Cla. Your pardon. Cor. And you as safely might have answered me, As I had casually ask't the time o'th day; What dressing you delight in, or what gown You most affect to wear. Cla. Once more I ask you pardon, you restore me, And I am now secur'd by your clear goodnesse, To give my weak opinionâ Cor. Of the man That did appear in thy thoughts to deserve Most honor. Cla. You'l excuse a womans verdict, My voice is for the stranger sir. Cor. Why so! You like him best; what horror was in this Poor question now? you mean the English man? Cla The same, most gracefull in his parts &amp; person. Cor. 'Tis well, I'me satisfied, and we both meet In one opinion too, he is indeed The bravest Cavalier, what hurt's in all This now? I see you can distinguish, wert thou A virgin Claudiana, thou would'st find Gentle and easie thoughts to entertain So promising a servant; I should be Taken with him my self, were I a Lady, And lov'd a man. Cla. How's this? my feares return. Enter Bellaura and Georgio. Cor. Madam Bellaura the Dukes charge is entred The Garden, let's choose another walk. Ex. Bel. Why you are conceited sirra, does wit Grow in this Garden? Ge. Yea, Madam while I am in't, I am a slip My self. Bel. Of Rosemary or time? Ge. Of wit sweet Madam. Bel. 'Tis pitty, but thou shouldst be kept with watering. Ge. There's wit in every Flower, if you can gather it. Bel. I am of thy mind. But what's the wit prethee of yonder tulip? Ge. You may read there the wit of a young Courtier. Bel. What's that? Ge. Pride, and shew of colours, a fair promising, Deare when 'tis bought, and quickly comes to nothing. Bel. The wit of that rose? Ge. If you attempt Madam to pluck a rose, I shall find a moral in't. Bel. No Country wit? Ge. That growes with pot-herbes, and poor roots, which here Would be accounted weeds, course things of profit, Whose end is kitchin Physick, and sound health; Two things not now in fashion. Bel. Your wit dances. Where learn't you all these moralls? Geo. I but glean From my young master Giovanni Madam, Hee'l run division upon every flower, He ha's a wit able to kill the weeds, And ripen all the fruit in the Dukes Orchard. Bel. Where is Giovanni? Geo. He went betimes to'th Academy, He is at all the exercises, we Shall ha such newes when he comes home. Bel. Why does Your master (being rich) suffer his son To work i'th garden? Geo. My master? hee's an honest mortall man Madam, It is my mistriss, that commands him to't, A shrow, and loves him not, but 'tis no matter; I ha' the better company, hee's here. Enter Giovanni. I'le leave him to you Madam, I must now Water my plants. Exit. Bel. Why? how now Giovanni, you frequent I hear The Academies. Gio. When I can dispence Madam, with time, and these employments, I Intrude a glad spectator at those schooles Of wit and action, which although I cannot Reach, I am willing to admire, and look at With pitty of my self lost here in darknesse. Bel. By this expression I may conceive How much you have improv'd, &amp; gain'd a language Courtly, and modest. Gio. Madam, you are pleas'd To make my uneven frame of words your mirth. I professe nothing but an humble ignorance, And I repent not, if by any way (My duty and manners safe) it may delight you. Bel. Indeed Giovanni I am pleas'd, but not With your suspition, that my praises are Other then what become my ingenuous meaning, For if I understand, I like your language, But with it I commend your modest spirit. Gio. It is an honour Madam, much above My youths ambition, but if I possesse A part of any knowledge you have dain'd To allow, it owes it self unto this school. Bel. What school? Gio. This Garden Madam, 'tis my Academy, Where gentlemen, and Ladies (as your self, The first and fairest, durst I call you mistris,) Enrich my eare, and observation With harmony of language, which at best I can but coldly imitate. Bel. Still more courtly! Why how now Giovanni, you will be Professor shortly in the art of complement, You were best quit the Garden, &amp; turn Courtier. Gio. Madam, I think upon the Court with reverence, My fate, is to adore it afar off, It is a glorious Landschape, which I look at As some men with narrow optick glasses Behold the starrs, and wonder at their vast (Though unknown) habitable worlds of brightness: But were my eye a nearer judge, and I Admitted to a clearer knowledge Madam Of the Court life, there I might find the truth Of mans best Ideas, and enjoy the happinesse, Now onely mine by naked speculation, I think how there I should throw off my dust And rise a new Creation. Bel. The Court Is much beholding to you Giovanni. Gio. It is a duty Madam I owe truth. Bel. A truth in supposition all this while. Gio. I should be sad if any experience should Betray an error in my faith, and yet So soft and innocent a trespasse, Madam, Might well expect a pardon. Bel. Some that have Freely enjoy'd the pleasures, or what else You so advance in Court, have at the last Been weary, and accus'd their gay Condition, Nay, chang'd their state for such an humble life As you professe, a gardiner. Geo. I despise not What I was born to Madam, but I should Imagine the disease lay in the mind, Not in the Courtier, that would throw away So spacious a blessing to be servile. Bel. You know not Giovanni your own happiness, Nor the Court sinnes, the pride and surfeits there Come not within your circle, there are few Pursue those noble tracts your fancy aims at, It is a dangerous Sea to launch into, Both shelves and rockes you see not, I, &amp; mermaids. Gio. What are they Madam? Bel. You have heard of Mermaides. Gio. You mean not women I hope Madam? Bel. Yes. Gio. Oh do not by so hard an application Increase the Poets torment, that first made That fabulous story to disgrace your sex, Y'are firm, and the fair seal of the great maker, A print next that of Angels. Bel. We are bound t'ee If our cause want a flourish, you have art To make us shew fair. Gio. And you are so, 'Tis malice dares traduce you; or blind ignorance That throws her strains, which fall off from your figures, For those which weaker understandings cal Your spots, are ermines, and can such as these Darlings of heaven, and nature, women, shoot At Court an influence like unlucky planets? They cannot sure, why you live Madam there, That are enough to prove all praise, a truth, And by a sweet example make 'em all Such as you are objects, of love and wonder, Oh then how bles't are they that live at Court, With freedome to converse with so much virtue; As your fair sex embraceth. Enter Ursula. Bel. Here's your mother. Gio. Shee was too hasty. Vrs. Madam I hope you'l pardon my sons rudeness To hold discourse with your Ladiship. Bel. 'Tis a courtesie, And he talkes well to passe away the time, Exceeding well, but I must to my Guardian The Dukeâ Exit. Vrs. Happinesse attend your Ladiship. Now sir what are you thinking of? Gio. Your pardon, nothing. Vrs. Nay stay, I must talk with you my self, But first what talk had you with my Lady? Gio. She was pleas'd to ask some questions. Vrs. What were they? Gio. I ha' forgot. Vrs. You ha' forgot y'are a leud And sawcy boy, go to, your father spoiles you; Enter Roberto. Vrs. But if you use me sirra 'oth this fashion I'le break your pate, I will, the Dukes owne sonne (My blessing upon him) would not answer me With I ha' forgot, I warrant you, but youâ Ro. Why, how now Vrsula, what? perpetuall clamours? Vrs. Oh here's your stickler. Gio. Nothing unkind to me, she was angry With your servant Georgio, and threatned to break His head, awayâ Geo. My head? come heeles.â Exit. Ro. Was it but so? she shall, she shall do that, With all my heart, and I will break it too. Vrs. Nay, then I will be friends with him. Ro. Where's the knave? Vrs. I wo'not be compell'd to break his head, And you were twenty husbands; fare you wel. Ro. 'Tis such a wasp, but she shannot wrong thee. Gio. I know she wo'not sir, she is my mother, She comes agen. Enter Thomazo, Malipiero, Barnardo and Marcello. Vrs. My heart does leap to see you. Ro. The Dukes son, and a troop of gallants, but I alwaies have sore eyes to see one there, That Signior Malipiero, he does owe me Already forty Crownes, and I forgive him. Mal. Signior Roberto, remember that I owe Your forty Crowns. Ro. Pray, do you forget 'em. Mal. I never pay till it come to a hundred. Ro. Never pay! it is no matter Signior. I were best be gone before he borrow more, It is a trick he uses to put on With his rich clothes, I'le vanish. Exit. Mal. Strange this English-man appears not? Vrs. I was afraid you had been sick my Lord. Tho. I was never sick in my life, but when I had a feaver, or some other infirmity. I'le call thee nurse stil. Giovanni. Gio. Sir. Tho. Thou lookest like a changling. Gio. The more's my misfortune. You are the Dukes son. Exit. Tho. Who can help it? nurse, Vrs. He was never courteous to women. Here's a gentleman, and they talk of a gentleman, Now could I weep for joy. I must take my leave sir. Tho. I must make bold with my nurse. Vrs. Blessings upon thy heart, how sweetly he kisses. Here was a touch for a Lady. Exit. Tho. Go thy waies, An admirable twanging lip, pitty thou art A thought too old: ha wagtaile! Ber. Does he come alone? Mal. Alone, be you resolute When you see me draw, shoot all your points Into his heart. Ber. Be confident. Mar. Unlesse He be steel-proof, he shannot boast abroad Much victory in Venice. Enter Florelli, and Giovanni. Gio. Signior Thomazo sir, is there. Flo. I thank you. Gio. You pay too much sir for no service. Tho. Here he is. We were wagering thou wouldst not keepe thy promise. Flo. I durst not make that forfeit of your grace, I most consult my own, when I am carefull To wait upon your honor. Mal. You are noble. Flo. Your humble servant gentlemen. Tho. Where didst supp? Flo. I was not willing to engage my self Abroad, lest I might trespasse on your patience. Tho. What shall's do this evening? Mal. Walk a turn, And then to a bona roba. Ber. A match. Tho. Giovanni! Thy spade, and hold my cloak. Mal. What's the device? Tho. I have 'great mind to dig now, do'st think I cannot Handle a spade, i'le make a bed with my Gentlemen now For a hundred Duccats. Mal. 'Tis a base employment, Fit for such a drudge as Giovanni. Gio. Sir! Mal. A drudge? I said, dee scorne your little dunghill breed? Gio. This is not noble. Mal. How mole-catcher? Flo. Forbear he is not arm'd. Mal. You were best be his champion. Tho. Are you good at that? I do not love to wear my doublet pink'd. Exit. Gio. Three against one? Giovanni recovers a sword, having first us'd his spade to side with the Englishman: Bernardo having lost his weapon flies. Mal. Hold. Gio. I am no drudg you'l find To be commanded sir, you painted flies, And onely fit for troutes. Flo. Let's give 'em play, and breath. Mal. Lost our advantage? is Thomazo fled? Mar. And Bernardo, we were best retire, that Gardiner Will stick me into ground, else for a plant. Exit. Mal. Expect wee'l be reveng'd. Exit. Gio. Let's prevent 'm. Flo. They are not worth it Giovanni, so I heard you nam'd. Gio. My name is Giovanni. Flo. Thou hast reliev'd, and sav'd my life, I find Their base conspiracie, what shall I pay Thy forward rescue? Gio. 'Tis but what I owe To justice, with the expence of blood and life To prevent treachery, reward I have Receiv'd i'th act, if I have done you service. But 'twas your innocence that made such hast To your own valour, not my sword preserv'd you. I am young, and never taught to fight. Flo. I prethee Accept this trifle, buy a sword, and wear it, Thou hast deserv'd to thrive a nobler way Then thy condition shewes. Gio. Though some would call This bounty, urge it not to my disgrace, I scorn to sell the motion of my arme! I fear you are not safe yet, there may be Danger in following them, and it grows dark. Have patience while I fetch a key, that shall Befriend you with a private way. Exit. Flo. Th'art noble, Though I am carelesse where the termes of honor Engage my life, 'tis wisdome not to lose it Upon their base revenge, but I must study Some other payment for this young mans courage. How ere his body suffer in a cloud, His spirit's not obscure, but brave, and active. Enter Cornari and Brano's arm'd. Cor. If my intelligence faile not, he must be Here still. This evening hath put on a Vizard To conspire with me, there he walkes, surprize him. They seize upon him, bind his armes and feet, and blind him with a bagg. Flo. Villaines, Cowards, Slaves, my sword. Bra. If you be lowd, wee'l strangle you. Cor. Dispatch. Bra. We ha done sir, is he for the river now? Cor. No, follow me. Exeunt. Enter Giovanni. Gio. These shew like officers, Alas hee's apprehended on their base Complaint, I cannot help; thy cause and innocence Must now befriend thee! base world! yet I may Injure, the parts abroad; 'tis onely Venice Is sick with these distempers, then, i'le leave it, And instantly pursue some other fate I'th warrs, it may cure something too within me, That is deny'd all remedy at home, Some bodies for their Physick, are design'd To change of aire, i'le try't upon my mind. Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Enter Malipiero and Thomazo. Tho. Not this Englishman to be found? Mal. Hee's not above ground Where I could suspect him in the Cityâ Tho. Let him goe, may be his hast topled him Into the river, and we may eat his nose In the next haddock. Mal. Wherefore did you fly? Tho. Do'st think 'twas fear? Mal. 'Twas something like a will, To keep your skin from oilet-holes. Tho. I grant you, What had I to do to bring up a fashion? Mal. We might ha' gone a sure and nearer way To ha' kill'd him in a right line with a bullet, But let him goe, so he quit Venice any way. Tho. Hee would spoile our mirth, but I much wonder Bernardo is not come yet, whom I sent Embassador for money to the Merchants. Mal. Nor Marcello, whom I employ'd to the same end, To my most Costive Uncle for some goldfinches. Tho. Why should the state have an Exchequer, and We want? Mal. For pious uses too, to drink their health; And see the Common-wealth go round In mutuall commerce of mirth and spirit, Which phlegme and usury hath almost stifled, Sobriety and long gownes spoile the City. 'Tis we would keep the body politick From stinking, ulcer'd with long obligations, And notaries, which now stuffe the Rialto, And poyson honest natures, that would else Live freely, and be drunk at their own charge. Tho. I would make new lawes, and I were Duke of Venice. Mal. We would not sit i'th chimney corner then, And sing like Crickets. Tho. We would roare like Trumpets, And deaf the Senators with, give us your moniesâ Mal. Their's? give us our own, their states, their wives, And wardrobes Scanderbeg. Tho. And their pretty daughters, My valiant Turk, who should feed high o'purposeâ Mal. To keep the wanton blood in titillations. Tho. It should be a Law, no maid should be in fashion. Mal. Yes let 'em be in fashion, but not hold. Tho. Not after fourteen be it then enacted. Mal. Wee would banish all the Advocates that refus'd To pimp, and prove it Civill Law. Tho. No scribe should dare to shew his ears in our Dominions Mal. Hang 'em, they are labells of the Law, and stinke, Worse then a fish-shambles in lent. No Iew Should turn a Christian upon perill of A Confiscation. Tho. Why? Mal. The slaves are rich, To turn 'em Christians were to spoile their Conscience, And make 'em hide their mony, 'tis lesse evill In state to cherish Jewes, then Christian Usurers. Tho. I will have every Citizen a Jew then. Mal. We have built no Seraglio yet. Tho. That's true, What think you of the Universities? Would not they serve? Mal. O excellent, They have severall schooles for severall games. Tho. And scaffolds For the spectators when we keep our acts. Mal. The Colledge rents would find the wenches petticoates, And the revenues of a score of Abbies Wel stript, would serve to rowl 'em in clean linnen, And keep the toyes in diet. Tho. excellent! But when we have converted to the use The Monasteries, where shall we bestow The Fryers, and the thin religious men? Mal. You may Keep them with little charge, water is all The blessing their poor thirst requires, and taylors Wo'not be troubled for new clothes, a hair shirt Will outwear a Copy-hold, and warm 4 lives, Or if you think 'em troublesome, it is A fair pretence to send 'em to some wild Country to plant the faith, and teach the infidells A way to Heaven, for which they may be burn't Or hang'd, and there's an end o'th honest men. There be a thousand waies to quiet them. Tho. My admirable Counsellor, thou shouldst be My supreme officer to see Justice done. Mal. You cannot honour men of worth too much. Tho. Wee'l ha the bridges all pull'd down, and made Of silver. Mal. Drosse! Gold is our orient metall. Enter Bernardo. Here is Benardo, welcome, where's the mony? Ber. Not a gazet: the merchants are all sullen, And say you owe too much already. Mal. These are Dogbolts. 'Tis time we had new lawes and they wo'not trust. Tho. But we must build No golden bridges at this rate with sun-beames. Mal. They were best content themselves with honest stone, Hard as the heart of your ungodly Merchants. Tho. Prethee let's leave our dream of frighting Sailors, And say, what hope hast thou of getting money For this daies mirth? Mal. Some hope there is, if my Uncle have but faith Enough, to credit what I never mean, Thrift and submission, and holy matters; 'Tis all the waies are left to cozen him And creep into his nature, I have pawn'd All my religion that il'e turne Fryer. Tho. Hast pawn'd thy religion, much good do him, Let him take the forfeit, so he send thee moneyâ Mal. For present use, and howl, and hang himself. I care notâohâhere's Marcello. Enter Marcello. Did'st speak with him? Mar. Yes. Mal. That's well. Mar. He doe's commend him to you, and with it thisâ Mal. I knew t'would take, his tender conscience Tho. Hast thou prevail'd? Mar. This halterâhe ha's tyed the knot himself, And saies next the Philosophers stone, hee knowes not What thing of nobler value to present you: And rather then you should delay for want Of a convenientâyou know what, you should Once more peruse his Orchard, there's one tree He would have bear no other fruit. Mal. I thank him. For his fine noose, would I had his neck in't, The Devill should not conjure him from this circle. Is this the end of all? Tho. No, not of all. Mal. I prethee try how it will holdâd'ee hear Let's lay our heads together. Which of you Is best acquainted with the Turk? Tho. What Turk. Mal. The great and mighty Sultan, the grand Signior. Or have you but a Christian correspondence With any of his heathen officers. Tho. What to doe? Mal. No rogue that lies purdue here for intelligence! Ber. What then? Mal. I would make a bargaine with him now and sell This City to the Pagan instantly. Venice is a Jewell, a rich pendant; Would hang rarely at the great Turkes eare. Tho. No doubt. Mal. Or at one horne of his half Moon. Mar. I think so. Mal. I would betray if I knew how, the state Or any thing for half a hundred Duccats To make one merry night, though after I Were broke upon a wheel, or set upright To peep through a cleft tree like a pole-cat In the high wayâno money from the Mungrells? Well if I live. I will to Amsterdam, And adde another schisme to the two hundred Fourscore and odd; I am resolv'd. Tho. What? Mal. To cry down all things That hang on wit, truth, or religion. Tho. Come, thou art passionate, is there no trick? No lewd device? let me see?âI have thought Away to raise us my dear Tully, a project Shall raise us, or i'le ventureâ Mal. What? Tho. My neck For hanging is the end of my device, Unlesse I thrive in't: go to the randevouz, To Rosabella's O' the grand Cavale, Kiss her and call for wines, my bullyrookes, A dish of dainty fidlers to curvet too, And drink a health that I may prosper, tumble And shake the house, I'le fetch you off. Mal. But signiorâ Tho. No more words, cannot you be gone, be drunk, And leave me to the reckoning, i'le return With Indian spoiles like Alexander. Exit. Mal. Spoken Like a true Macedonian, we are gone. He's right, and may in time, and our good breeding Be brought to something, may deserve the Gallies. Follow your leaders Mirmidons. Both. We attend. Exeunt. Enter Giovanni and Georgio. Ge. But will you venture Signior Giovanni Your body to the warrs indeed? Gio. I mean so. Ge. And leave me to be lost, or thrown away Among the weeds here! Gio. Try thy fortune wo'me. Ge. Yes, and come hopping home upon one legg. Will all my pay then buy a handsome halter To hang my arm in, if it be but maim'd, Yet I endure a battail everyday, My mistris hath a mouth carries whole Cannon; And if you took that engine to the warrs, You would find it do rare service. Gio. What? Ge. Her tongue; Make her but angry, and you'l need no more Artillery to scoure them with a breach. What spoile her breath would make in a market place? Gio. Be lesse satyricall; I must not hear this, she is my mother. Geo. She is my mistris, and thats worse, but I'me resolv'd, I'le to the warrs w'e, do not tell her on't, My prentiship is worse then killing there. My hand, i'le w'ee. Gio. In the mean time buy yee a sword, and belt, And what is fit. Gives him money. Ge. No more, i'le be a souldier; And kill according to my pay, this will Suffice to vamp my body, I may rise If I grow rich in valour, that will do't, Mony and a tilting feather make a Captain. Exit. Gio. There is no other way to quiet the Afflictions here, beside 'tis honorable, And warre a glorious mistris. Enter Bellaura, and Roberto. 'Tis Bellaura and my Father. Bel. I know Madam you may break his resolution, If you be pleas'd, you may command; hee's here. Bel. I'le try my skill. Ro. Blessings attend your Ladiship. I'le waite for the successe. Exit. Bel. How now Giovanni, What with a sword, you were not us'd to appeare Thus arm'd, your weapon is a spade I take it. Gio. It did become my late profession Madam; But I am chang'd. Bel. Not to a souldier. Gio. It is a title Madam will much grace me, And with the best collection of my thoughts I have ambition to the warrs. Be. You have? Gio. Oh 'tis a brave profession, and rewards All losse wee meet with double weight in glory, A calling Princes still are proud to own, And some do willingly forget their crownes To be commanded, 'tis the spring of all We here entitle fame to, Emperors And all degrees of honors, owing all Their names to this imployment, in her vast And circular embraces holding Kings, And making them; and yet so kind as not To exclude such private things as I, who may Learn and commence in her great arts. My life Hath been too uselesse to my self and Country, 'Tis time I should imploy it to deserve A name within their Registry, that bring The wealth, the harvest home of well bought honor. Bel. It is an active time I must confesse, And the unhappy scene of war too nere us But that it should enflame you on the suddain To leave a calm, and secure life, is more Then commonly it workes on men of your Birth, and condition, besides I hear Your Father is not willing you should leave him, To engage your self in such apparent danger. Here you will forfeit your obedience Unlesse you stay. Gio. I cannot despair Madam Of his consent, and if by my own strength Of reason I incline him not, it was In my ambition to addresse my humble Suite to your Ladiship to gain it for me, At worst it is no breach of duty Madam, If I preferre my Country and her cause Now bleeding, before any formall ties Of nature to a soft indulgent father. For danger, let pale soules consider it, It is beneath my fears. Bel. Yet I can see Through all this resolution iovanni? 'Tis somthing else hath wrought this violent change. Pray let me be of counsel with your thoughts, And know the serious motive, come be clear, I am no enemy, and can assist Where I allow the cause. Gio. You may be angry Madam, and chide it as a sawcy pride In me to name, or look at honor, nor Can I but know what small addition Is my unskilfull arme to aide a Country. Bel. I may therefore justly suspect, there is Something of other force that moves you to The warrs, enlarge my knowledge with the secret. Gio. At this command I open my heart, Madam I must confesse there is another cause Which I dare not in obedience Obscure, since you will call it forth, and yet I know you will laugh at me. Bel. It would ill Become my breeding Giovanni. Gio. Then, Know Madam, I'me in love. Bel. In love with whom? Gio. With one I dare not name, shee's so much Above my birth and fortunes. Bel. I commend Your flight, but does she know it? Gio. I durst never Appear with so much boldnesse to discover My hearts so great ambition, 'tis here still, A strange and busie guest. Bel. And you think absence May cure this wound. Gio. Or death. Bel. I may presume; You think shee's fair. Gio. I dare as soon question your beauty Madam, The onely ornament, and starre of Venice, Pardon the bold comparison, yet there is Something in you resembles my great mistris She blushesâ Such very beames dispearseth her bright eye Powerfull to restore decrepit nature, But when she frownes, and changes from her sweet Aspect (as in my fears I see you now Offended at my boldnesse) she does blast Poor Giovanni thus, and thus I wither At heart, and wish my self a thing lost in My own forgotten dust, but it's not possible At last (if any starres blesse but high thoughts) By some desert in war, and deeds of honor.) (For mean as I, have rais'd themselves to Empire) That she without a blush to stain her cheek May own me for a servantâI am lost In wandring apprehensions. Bel. Poor Giovanni, I pitty thee, but cannot cureâI like Thy aspiring thoughts, and to this last of love, Allow the warrs a noble remedy. Enter Roberto and Ursula. I have argu'd against your sonns resolve, but find His reasons overcome my weak dispute. And I must counsell you to allow 'em too. Urs. Nay, I was never much against it Madam. Ro. She loves him not, but does your Ladiship Think fitting, he should go? Bel. Yes, yes 'tis honorable; And to encourage his forward spirit, The Generall is my kinsman Giovanni, What favours he can do you, you shall have My letters to entreat, and at my charge You shall be furnish'd like a Gentleman, Attend me at my lodgings. Gio. You bind all My services; why this will make a shew yet. Ro. Nay, then take my consent and blessing too. Urs. And mine: the Duke. Exeunt. Enter Duke and Marino. Du. Bellaura, I must speak to you. Bel. I attend. Du. You have my purpose, and return me clearly How he bestowes himself, and what society Withdrawes him from his duty thus. Mar. I shall With my best care. Du. I fear that Malipiero, [with Bellaura] But let me find your diligence: Bellaura. Exit. The Scene adorn'd with Pictures amongst the rest Claudiana's Enter Bravos with the Englishman, they unbind him and Exeunt. Flo. I am all wonder: shall I trust my sences, A fair and pleasant gallery; was I Surpriz'd for this? or doe I dream, I did Expect the end of my conveyance should Have been more fatal, No tract appears, or signe of those that brought me, The place is rich in ornament, sure these Are Pictures, all things silent as the Images, And yet these speak, some do inhabit here, This room was not ordain'd onely for air And shadowes, 'tis some flattering Prologue to My death, some plot to second the affront Of Malipiero with more scorne to ruine me. Enter Cornari with a case of Pistolls. What art? Cor. A friend. Flo. That posture and presentment Promise no great assurance, yet there's something Within that noble frame would tempt me to Believe thou art. Cor. What? Flo. A black murderer. Point not thy horrid messengers of death Upon a man disarm'd, my bosome is No proof against those fiery Executioners. How came I to deserve from thee unknown So black a purpose, as thy lookes present me? I never saw thy face, nor am I conscious Of any act, in whose revenge, thou hast Put on this horror, let me know my guilt Before I die, although I never liv'd At that poor rate to fear a noble death; Yet unprepar'd, and thus to die, doth something Stagger my soul, and weaken my resolve To meet thy Execution, thou hast Too good a face to be a Mercenary Cut-throat, and Malipiero would become The hangmans office better. Cor. You believe then, How easily I can command your destine, I have no plot with any Malipiero, And thus remove thy fear. He carries in the Pistolls and returnes. Flo. Is he gone? Cor. Y'are still within My power, but call your selfe my guest, not prisoner, And if you be not dangerous to your self Nothing is meant but safety here and honor. Flo. This does amaze me more; but do Italians Compell men to receive their courtesies? Cor. I must not give you reasons; yet for your Surprize, you may receive a timely knowledge And not repent. I am a Gentleman, And by that name secure thee, if you can Fancie a peace with this restraint, 'tis none But something that may please you above freedom, If your unruly thoughts tempt a resistance, Death is let in, at every thing you look at. Flo. I'le leave my wonder and believe, what now Must I obey? Cor. First walk away your fright. Flo. 'Tis off. Cor. How do you like this gallery? Flo. 'Tis very handsome. Cor. And these pictures. Flo. Wel. Cor. Your eyes are yet too carelesse, pray examine 'em. Flo. They cannot answer. Cor. Now your opinion. Flo. Very good faces. Cor. Have your eyes ever Met with a substance that might reflect On any of these shadowes sir in Venice? Flo. Never. Cor. Look a little better, is there nothing Of more then common curiosity, In any of these beauties. Flo. I have seen Fair ones, what should this mean? Cor. But pray tel me, Of these (which some have prais'd for handsomness) Which doth affect you most? I guesse you have By frequent view, and the converse with Ladies Ariv'd at excellent judgement: Flo. I did not Expect this Dialogue, yet i'le be free, I profess stranger to 'em all, but this [pointing to Claudiana] I should elect the fairest and most worthy A masculine Embrace. I build upon The promise of your Honour, I should else Be nice in my opinion. Cor. You are just, And I prefer that too, what will you say To call that Lady Mistris, and enjoy her? Shee's noble to my knowledge, but enough At this time. I must pray your kind excuse If (whilst) you walk into this room. Opening the hanging. Flo. A fair one. Cor. Which is design'd your lodging, I become Your jailour, and make sure this Gallery Til my return; be constant to your temper, There shall be nothing wanting to procure You safe, and pleasant hours. Flo. Distrust falles off. I will expect to find you noble, though My faith bind not to all, and enter. Exit. Cor. So. I tread a maze too, but must not resign My office, till I perfect my design Exit. Enter Malipiero with Rosabella dancing, Bernardo, Marcello. [Dance] Ber. Active Malipiero. Mar. Excellent They move as they had nothing else but soul. Mal.

Ro. What hath advanc'd your brain thus Malipiero? You were not wont to talk at such a height, There is some mighty fortune drpoping, is Your Uncle sick, whose heir you hope to be? Mal.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Enter Cornari, after him Claudiana. Clau. Your pleasure sir; you did command my presence. Cor. Are you come? you and I must not be Interrupted Claudiana. Claud. Why do you shut your Chamber? Cor. Wee must be private. How does my life? Clau. Well sir, if you be so. Cor. I have a sute to thee, my best Caudiana. Clau. To me? it must be granted. Cor. That's well said, But 'tis a businesse (sweet) of mighty consequence, More pretious then my life. Cla. Goodnesse forbid I should not give obedience to the least Of your commands, but when your life requires My service, I should chide my heart, and thoughts Unlesse they put on wings to shew their duty. Cor. Nay, 'tis a businesse sweet will speak thy love. Cor. Thou knowest how many years since the Priest tyed Our holy knot, with what religious flowing Of chast and noble love our hearts have met, How many blessings have I summ'd in thee, And but in thee, for unto this, Heaven gave not (That which indeed doth Crown all Marriage,) Children, thou hast been fruitfull Claudiana In all that's good, but onely fruitfulnesse; And when I think who in my want of that Great blessing of thy womb, must be my heir, A base and impious villain, to possesse And riot in my spacious fortunes, I Forget that other happinesse in thy person, And let in a vexation to consume me. Cla. I know not what to fear, it is heavens will And not my fault. Cor. Oh no, the fault is mine, All mine Claudiana, for thou art not barren 'Tis I, a man prodigious and mulcted By nature, without faculty of man To make our marriage happy, and preserve This fair; this lovely figure, be at peace And let me blush, a thing not worth the love Of such a bounteous sweetnesse. Cla. Let me fall [Kneeles] Beneath that which sustaines me, ere I take In a beleef, that will destroy my peace, Not in the apprehension of what You frame to accuse your self, but in fear My honour is betraid to your suspition; Oh kill me sir, before I lose your thought, Your noble thought. Cor. Rise, with thy tears I kisse Away thy tremblings; I suspect thy honor? My heart will want faith to believe an Angel, That should traduce thy fair name, thou art chast. As the white down of heaven, whose feathers play Upon the wings of a cold winters gale, Trembling with fear to touch the impurer earth. How are the roses frighted in thy cheekes To palenesse, weeping out of transparent dew: When a loose story is but nam'd? thou art The miracle of a chast wife, from which fair Originall, drawn out by heavens own hand, To have had one Copie, I had write perfection To all my wishes here, but 'tis denyed me, Nor do I mock thee with a fable, while I miserably complain, convinc'd, and lost In my own Masculine defect; but yet I love thee Claudiana, dost not think so? And after so much injury, I bring Not my repentance onely, but a just And noble satisfaction. Cla. You oppresse My sences with the weight of new amazement. Cor. I must be clear, thou must embrace anotherâ Another in my bed, whom from the world I have made choice to know thee, be not frighted This way is left, and this alone to recompence My want, and make both happy. Cla. I embrace Another in your bed? Cor. Dost think I would Attempt, or wish thee to't, without a care In every circumstance to both our fames? Cla. Fame? are you master of your reason? dare you Provoke heaven thus? Cor. Heaven onely shall be witnesse, Whose secresie i'le trust, but not anothers. Beside the principall agent, to get heaven. Cla. Y'are no Italian sure. Cor. Yes, and thy husband, A just one to thy memory, that would Cancell his faith, rather then be a strict Idolater of words, and severe lawes, To the destroying of so sweet a figure; I would not have thee flye like birds i'th aire, Or shippes that leave no tract, to say here was, So rich a blessing, rather like a plant Should root, and grow, and bloom, &amp; bear for ever. Cla. I'me lost for ever. Cor. Be wise and meet my wishes, 'tis my love That hath 'orecome all nice considerings To do thee justice. Nor will I intrude Upon thy bosome one shall be unwelcome, Hee's honorably born, of comely person, But has a soule addes glory to 'em both, A boy from him, born to my name and fortunes Leaves not another wealth to my ambition. To raise thy free consent my Claudiana, 'Tis he, Whom thou dost think worth thy owne praise, The gentleman victorious for his parts, So late in Venice, the English Cavalier. Cla. I am undone. Cor. To be short, I have surpriz'd his person for this use, He hath been many daies an obscure guest Within the lodgings next the Garden, for I must confesse I have had struglings in My nature, and have sate in Councell 'gainst My selfe sometime, touching this great affair, But I have answer'd every thing oppos'd it, And took this time to acquaint thee. Cla. Good sir kill me. Cor. I will, And him too, if ye mingle not and make The project as I cast it, be not obstinate, Why, he shall nere discover who thou art, If thou be faithfull to thy self, thou maist Pretend thy self some pleasant bona-roba. Or take what name, and shape thou wilt. Cla. There's none Can hide my shame, or wash the stain away. Cor. What shame or stain is in't when it is kept A secret darker then the book of destinie From mankind? Cla. Am I practis'd in those arts? Of sin that he should take me for a Curtesan? Nay, rather let me be known your wife, It will oblige him more to use me well, And thank your loving paines that brought me to him. If I must be a whore, and you aâ Cor. Stay, and I aâwhat? I bleed within me. Cla. This key will make the Chamber free, I follow. Consider sir, I'me else undone for ever Ex. Cor. Why if he know me for her husband, 'tis Without a name, I can secure my honor, And send him quickly to eternall silence. I'me resolv'd they must obey, proceed, A little blood will wash away this deed. Ex. Enter Duke, Senators, Attendants, Letters upon a Table. Duke Our City drooping with the wounds so late Receiv'd, is now to study with what joyes To entertain so great a victory. Treuiso is return'd to our obedience, Almost without a losse, how many fell On the adverse part, those papers signifie, And must enlarge our tryumph: but is't not Strange what our generall writes of Giovanni, Whose spirit he admires, and forward valour, Referring to his bold attempt, our Conquest, That he advanc'd his head and sword first on The enemies walls, which inflam'd our army To second him with courage, and that after With his own hands he slew their generall, Whose fall shot death and trembling through their Army. Can. Where is Giovanni? Du. He is by direction of our generall Now marching hither, to his onely conduct. The Captives are remitted, and his act By us to be considered, but we have Sent order for the placing of his Prisoners Securely, and commanded he should here Attend our pleasure Can. The young Gardiner? Du. The same, whose early valour takes away The prejudice of humble birth, and ought To be encourag'd nobly. Can. 'Tis but justice. Enter Marino. Is't possible the Gardiners Son should so Behave himself in war, He will deserve some honor for't. Du. Why may not Our power dispence, and though his low condition By our rule exempt him (for his gallant service Done) now create him gentleman of Venice, With a noble pension from our treasury To bear his title up? Can. We give it strangers, Whose birth we not examine, He deserves it. Du. Let him receive no favour For his relation to me, but take His place and punishment with the rest, away I cast him from my thought. Exit Marino. Can. Why comes not Our Generall himself? Du. Reasons of war May yet compell his stay, hee's to repair Some breaches which our Souldiers made, &amp; wisely By some new fortification, secure The Town if the Enemy should reinforce. Att. Signior Giovanni waites. Enter Mar. Du. Hath he dispos'd By our direction those prisoners were Sent by our Generall? Atten. He hath and please your excellencie. Du. Admit him. Enter Giovanni plum'd and brave Georgio his servant Gio. All health and honor to the Duke and Senate. Du. We thank thee Giovanni, and will spare Your trouble to relate what we have gain'd I'th war; Our General writes how much our Venice Doth owe to you, whose maiden yet bold valour Hath wrought our safety, and supprest the late Insolent Genowese. Gio. Your bounty makes That mine, which I want merit sir to challenge, But if my will to serve my Country (for Beside that name and warm desires, I dare Call nothing mine) y'are pleas'd to accept and cherish A young mans duty, you will teach me in The next employment to deserve indeed. Till when, you lose not, to have built upon This humble pile, a monument of your goodnesse, To tell the world, although misplac'd on me, You love a growing vertue. Du. This Giovanni? His words tast more of courtier then the Garden. To shew we understand, and to that knowledge Have will to recompence the desert, Giovanni The Senate bidds you ask, what in your power Your thought can aim at, to reward your service, And you shall soon possesse it. Geo. Ask, ask quickly, A hundred thousand double double duccats. 'Twil serve us both, do't, beggars must be impudent. Gio. Now you destroy what else might live to serve you, This grace will make me nothing, when I call My airy worth to ballance, keep those glorious Rewards for men borne, and brought up in honor? That may be great and able Columnes to Your ever envyed state; alas I rise Like a thin reede beneath this Common-wealth, Whose weight, an Atlas must sustain like heaven, This favour is too mighty, and if you Command me, ask a just reward, 'tis nothing. Geo. You had as good ha said nothing, I blush for you, You know many Souldiers So modest, to refuse pay, or preferment? They cannot have it sometimes, after many Petitions to the State, and now their mindes Are soluble and apt to powre out favours, You to be so maidenlyâ Gio. May I credit With pardon of your wisdomes, that you mean To encourage thus the low born Giovanni? Geo. Now he makes question of their honesty too, Oh simple souldier. Du. We look not at thy root, but at thy blossom, And as a preserver of our Country We offer up a gratitude, consult With thy best judgement, (though beside this act Of his abroad) I can give no account [Aside] Why I should love this young man, or prefer him, I know not by what mystery, I have Had thoughts to wish him more then common fortune, And this occasion of his merit offered. I will pursue. Geo. Do as I counsell you, and remember, I Have left my fortunes, and my trade to serve you. Gio. Call it not pride if I be willing to Believe your excellence, that I have done Somthing your goodnesse prompts you to reward, And the grave Senate, I have thought. Du. Be free. Geo. Now do I expect to be half a Senator at least. Gio. And since you raise my act to such a merit, I will not ask a thing too much beneath it. Geo. Well said Vannij. Gio. And shame your bounty; yet I may fear You will not grantâ Geo. Agen? Du. Name it with confidence. Gio. I look at no reward of gold. Geo. How's that? hee's out on's part. Gio. I know not, By what fate I contemn it, nor at titles Of honor, or command, or what can trench On state or wealth. Geo. I thank yee heartily, I must to dig agen. Gio. Employ such gifts, To pay some slight, and mercenary soules, That make their end of good, reward, and not It selfe, but since you have impos'd I should Make choyce of somwhat know my ambition aims. Du. At what? Gio. It is too great a happinesse, but I now Consider I have pratled to the wind, What I desire is not within your power, And what you may command, not in my wishes, For I would ask Bellaura: can you make Me fit for such a blessing? no, you cannot, Unlesse I were unborn, and should agen Come forth, not Giovanni, but the Son Of some bright name, and this world-taking honor. Du. Bellaura? strange request. Enter Marino and Bellaura. Mar. Madam I dare not Be seen, if you prevail, I shall attend, And put his mercy into act. Exit. Du. Shee's here. Bel. I have a suit to your highnesse. Du. Me Bellaura? Bel. About your son, whom men to your dishonor Lead like some base offender. Du. I must speak The cause into your ear. [Whispers to her] Gio. I was too blame To mention her so publick, but my heart Grew sick with silence, and their proposition To ask what I desir'd most, prevail'd Against my reason: Du. Leave him to me, Bellaura. Do you observe that gentleman? Bel 'Tis Giovanni. He does become the souldier. Du. He has done wonders Abroad, and quit our gratitude, to be Onely by you rewarded, can you love him? Bel. I understand you not. Du. And marry him? Bel. How have I lost my self, since I became Your charge, a legacie bequeath'd your care By my dead father, the late Duke of Venice, That you should think I can descend with such Forgetfullnesse of my self, my birth or fortunes To place my love on one so poorly born. Du. You blush. Bel. 'tis anger in my blood to hear him nam'd. [To Giovanni] You pay me coursely for my charity. Learn modesty hereafter to be gratefull. I ha done we'e sir Exit. Geo. Do you heer the tit? be wise, And look at ready money, 'tis a better Commodity then any Lady in Christendom; Gio. Pray dismiss, And pardon Giovanni. I am satisfied. For your own honor let not my ambition Be told abroad, i'le check and punish my Aspiring thoughts hereafter. Du. You have leave, Come gentlemen, He is in love. Du. I pitty him. Exit. Duke and Senator. Geo. What shall become of us now by your folly? Gio. Wee'l to the Garden George, and there begin Another grouth, for what we have's despis'd. Geo. I knew I should return to my dear dunghill. Gio. I prethee see the armour which Bellaura Bestow'd on me, brought home. Geo. Your armour? yes We might have worn soft natur'd silk, and you had Been rul'd by me, a pox of love for my part, 'Tis good for nothing, but to make things dear. Gio. I'le be reveng'd upon my starrs, that made Me poor, and dye forgotten in my shade Ex. A Table prepar'd, two tapers. Enter Florelli. Flo. I find no great devotion in this Monastick life, the Maior Domo promis'd A Mistris here of that complexion, But I like not this solitude, And tedious expectations, I shall nere do things handsomly, Give me freedome and fair play, And turn me to a harpy, but to be thus Compell'd to an imbrace (for thats the meaning Of my slie Signior, if it be not worse) Fed high to encounter with an Amazon, I know not? tis not well, nor conscionable In my opinion: I hear some busie About the lock. Enter Cornari. My Jaylor? What now fellowes? Sir, if I must ha my throat cut, as much Better I do not hope, though I deserve not That bounty from your hands, I live so dully, I would request you set a time, and't be A day or two, to pray and think of matters, And then turn me loose to the other world! Cor. Read that. [gives him a paper] He shannot see my blushes, I must pitty Thee Claudiana, but my stubborn fate Will have it so, it is to make thee live Although we both must suffer, and I like A father thus, whose child at play upon A rivers bank, is faln into the stream, Leap in, and hazard all to save a little, But I must on. Exit. Flo. Amazement Circles me, Such wonders are not read in every Marriage, What shall I doe? madnesse to question it. I must resolve or die? since there's no help, Tis something if she be but like that face To comfort my proceeding. Enter Cornari leading his wife Veild. Cor. Behold, and take as lent this treasure from me, I must expect it back agen with interest. locks the door and Ex. Flo. The dore is fast agen, here is a president For husbands that want heirs to their estate. A goodly person. Please you Lady, to Unveil; a rich and most inviting beauty. [she unveils] I am all flame, shall I take boldnesse, after My duty paid your white hand, to aspire And touch your lipânow could I wish to dwell here. [he kisses] Can you read Lady? She takes the paper &amp; turns. She turnes away her face. I hope my Signior Has taken paines to bring her to the businesse, And not left me to break her: can she speak? Those lines (I know not how you like 'em Madam) Were none of my invention, the character, I guesse to be your husbands. I am here A prisoner to his will, to which unlesse You give obedience, I have took leave Of day for ever, destin'd by his vow To an eternall shade. Exit Claudiana. She leads the way; Conscience be calme, no grumblings now of piety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Giovanni. The pieces of Armour hung upon severall trees Roberto, Ursula. Gio. These were the excellent Bellaura's gift, Of no use now to me, but to keep fresh The memory of my dreams and that I lov'd her. I see how passion did blind my reason, And my prodigious hopes vanish'd to air Have left me to contemplate my own vanity. Ro. I know not, but if I may credit Georgio That did wait on thee to the Senate, thou Hast lost an opportunity, that might Have made us all Clarissimo's Giovanni. I might have kept my reverend Mules, and had My Crupper worshipped by the Plebeians, And Ursula here been Madam heaven knowes what, And did you wisely to refuse? Ur. Nay, nay I know He was not born to do us good, not stoop To take preferment from the Duke and Senate? Ro. Well, 'twas his modesty. Ur. He learn't it not from me. Ro. No moreâ Ur. You wil be alwaies taking his part against me, But I know, what I know, and that's a secret, Here comes the t'other Dunderhead. Enter Georgio. Geo. The armour is hung up already, this We must all come to. Ro. What to the Gibet Georgio? Pointing to the Helmet. Geo. Master look here. If you had but this hole to put your head in, It would be a great preservative to your hearing, And keep out all the noise, of my Dames Culvering, Within this fortification well lock'd up. You would think her loudest scolding a meer whisper. Urs. What's that you talk of your Dame sirra? Geo. Oh dame, I have newes for you. Urs For me? what is't? whom does your new's concern? Geo. One that you love with all your heart. Ro. Who is't knave? Geo. Knave? call your word in, and eat it, I'le advise, You may fare worse: you do not hear the news then? Urs. I shall when you'l find utterance. Geo. The newesâ We are all of one Religion? Ro. Out with it. Ge. Every thing is not to be talk'd on. Ro. So it seems by your concealment. Urs. Shall we hear it? Geo. Yes? Signior Thomazoâ Urs. What of him? Geo. There's a gentleman, and you talk of a gentleman. Urs. What of Thomazo? now am I longing. Geo. I heard, as I came hitherâ Vrs. What? Ro. Let us hear too. Urs. What? be brief. Geo. That he is to lose his head Mistrissâ Urs. Now a thousand blisters upon that tongue. Geo. But you do not know for what, mistrisse there's it, You are so angry still at half a businesse. Urs. For what is he to suffer? oh my heart! Geo. For nothing but high treason. Ro. How? Geo. You ha'not patience, to hear a story out. Ro High treason said he? that's a shrewd business. Urs. Thomazo lose his head? Ro. So it seems. Urs. Better thy generation were headlesse. Geo. I told you but in good will, because I knew You lov'd him. I ha done. Exit. Urs. Passion O my dear heart! i'le to the Duke My self, and beg his pardon. Ro. You'l make Your self a party in the treason, will you? You'l beg his pardon, you'l beg a halter, And sooner 'twill be granted. Urs. Giovanni, Sweet Giovanni, there's a sunshine word. Deere child go with us. Ro. Us? dost think i'le goe And run my head into the hempe? Vrs. Best hony-suckle! One word ohine will strike the pardon dead. Gio. Ide rather go a pilgrimage. Urs. Thou shalt go a pilgrimage, another time To the worlds end, I charge thee on my blessing, And husband you must go too. Ro. No, no not I. I thank you Ursula, i'le not have my foot Nor hand in any treason. Urs. Is it so much to kneel? you shall say nothing. Unlesse you please, leave all the talk to me, Ro. I wo'not go, though the Duke send for me. Urs. How? that's a piece a treason. Ro. So, if I go not, Shee'l betray me too; well Giovanni shall go too, Where is he? Vrs. Let me alone to conjure him. Shall we go presently, delaies are dangerous. The rascall George is gone too, all forsake me In my distresse. Ro. What will you say Vrsula, When you come there; what will the Dukes think on you? Or who shall suffer for your impudence? And what? that is considerable, I have No mind to go agen. Vrs. Then I'le spoile the Garden, Break up the hedges, and deface the works Your darling Giovanni made; i'le let in A regiment of swine, and all their Officers To undermine the Castle he made last, And fortified with Cannon, though I dye for't. Ro. More treason, well I will go, but I hope You wo'not trudge this evening, if we must Resolve upon't, let us do things discreetly. Vrs. That was well said, nay, I am for discretion For all my hast. Ro. I think it most convenient To wait his businesse, coming forth his Chamber To morrow morning Vrsula, and then let Good natures work, to nights no time, We must consult our Pillowes; what to say; And how to place our words. Vrs. Now 'tis my best Pigeon, let's home instantly. Ro. A sober pace goes far, not too fast Vrsula, Remembring the Proverb, and what followes; We should march slow to save me from the gallows. Exit. Enter Cornari with a Pistoll and a rapier. Florelli. Cor. You have had your time of pleasure, can you pray? Flo. Pray, what do you mean Signior. Cor. The Lady whom you have enjoy'd, commanded I should present one of these two, or both In token of her gratitude. Flo. This cannot Be earnest sir. Cor. These are the Jewells Which you must wear sir next your heart: how de'e Affect the lustre of this toy? 'tis bright, But here's a thing will sparkle. Flo. I am lost. Is this the promise of my safety? Cor. Yes, This will secure all, thou dull Ilander, 'Cause you can dance, and vault upon a hobbihorse, De'e think to mount Madonas here, and not Pay for the sweet Carreere Fool, to thy prayers, For when these messengers salute thy heart, Thy soul shall find, I'm an Italian, And wo'not trust a life to him, whose tongue Commands my honor. Flo. Art a Christian? Cor. As much as comes to a Venetians faith, That believes no man is more to fit die Then he, that has been capering with my wife. Flo. Ye cannot sir forget I was betrai'd, Awake thy conscience, and let that answer I have obey'd a dire necessity, And was brought hither by a stratagem. Cor. 'Tis all one Signior; I presume you gave Consent to the deere matter of delight, Which is not held convenient you should talk of. Flo. Hold. Cor. Hope not to breath ten minutes, gather up Those thoughts you would have wait upon you to Another world. Flo. Then 'tis high time to think Of other matters, though you have cruelly Resolv'd there is no safety for your fame, To let me still be numbred with the living. (Which if your scattered reason were collected, I could refute,) but I'le not hope it now,) Since most ignobly 'gainst the rules of honor, And faith already forfeit, you will make This undefenced pile your sacrifice, Yet do not kill me twice. Cor. Twice? Flo. Such a rage Were infinite; practise not cruelty Upon my second life, by murdering my Eternity, allow to my last breath, Leave to discharge the weight of many sinnes Into the bosome of some confessor. Cor. This may be granted, 'tis not much unreasonable. Flo. Your charity will think it fit to allow Some minutes to collect my self. Cor. To shew My design has no malice in't, i'le do Your soul that office, though our bodies must not Enjoy this aire together many howrs. I'le send one to you. Exit. Flo. The innocence of a Saint, Wod not secure his life from an Italian When his revenge is fixt. In what black hour Did I salute the world, that I am thrown Upon so hard a fate? it is not fit To expostulate with heaven, or I could say Something in my defence, (as I am man) To keep this mighty rock from falling on me, My tutelar Angell be at counsell with My thoughts, and if there be a path of safety Direct my trembling steps to find, and tast it. Enter Cornari in a Friers habit. Has kept his word, and 'tis no time to trifle, As y'are a Priest, and by that sacred order And scapular you wear, not onely hear me But use your pious art to save from ruine A man condemn'd for that which heaven and you Call vertue, for not doing a black deed Would damn three soules at once, &amp; if your power Cannot prevail for mercy to my life, I challenge you when I am dead, to be A witnesse of my innocence. Cor. This has No shape of a confession. Flo. Nor do I Under that holy seal discourse a story, Yet Father I must throw my self upon Your Charity. Know therefore I am betraid, And by the plot of him that owes this Palace (Whose name is never like to meet my knowledge) Snatch'd up, one fatall evening, and forc'd hither By some dark ministers he had employ'd (I know not which way) to this fatall chamber. I shudder but to name what impious act Against his own, and his dear Ladies honor He had design'd for me; Her chaster soul Should have been stain'd, in his distrust of heaven, To blesse him with an heir, and her white treasure. By me a stranger rifled, had not providence. Chain'd up our blood, so that the hours he gave To serve his black ambition, and our lust, We onely spent in prayers for his conversion. Cor. Ha. Flo. This yet he knowes not, and it is not safe To appear in our own vertue, since the justice We did our peace, in crossing his expectance May improve his rage to both our ruines. This Sad story frights you, there is horror in't, But 'tis an hour, the last, without some miracle To rescue me (a man disarm'd) from violence, Nor dare I mock heaven now, or hang upon My soul the burden of a lie, when tis Taking her last eternall flight, It is not A fear to dye afflicts me, with my faith And innocence about me; I have look'd Death in the face, and be it thought no boast To say, I have taught others by example To march up to the ugliest face of danger. But to die thus dishonorably, to be Sent out o'th world i'th dark, without a name Or any account to those, to whom I owe My blood, and birth? persons that carry names Of honor in my Country? This doth stagger me To quit my life, and may excuse my addresse To you, who have Authority from heaven To take his fury off, whom otherwise I expect my violent executioner. I have some tremblings for his Lady, whose Most holy tears, stream'd through my soul compassion, And charm'd my blood, tears, if he durst have patience Were powerfull enough to beg from heaven That blessing which he fondly thinks to hasten, With losse of his eternity. Cor. No more. Exit Conrari hastily, having thrown off the habit Enter again with Claudiana. Forgive me, oh forgive me Claudiana, And if my sin of forcing thy obedience Beyond the rules of honor, and of marriage Have not quite murd'red thy affection; Wish me a little life for my repentance. Cl. I joy to hear this from you. Fl. There's work within me, and so deep a sense Of my own shame and sorrow, that I feel My heart already weeping out a bath To make thee white agen. Cla. Sir, in what best I understand, I must ask you forgivenesse. Cor. Ha mine, for what, betraying thee to darknesse? Cla. For disobeying your command. Cor. Thou didst The impious act by my design, which takes Thy guilt away, and spreads the leprosie Upon my self. Cla. Although you kill me sir, I must remove the cloud, and let you see Me as I am, not chang'd from my first innocence. Cor. Possible? Cl. Most easie, where there is A chast resolve, and I must tell you sir, Although I wanted courage to oppose Your passion, when your reason, and religion Were under violence of your will, my heart Resolv'd to try my own defence, and rather Then yeeld my self a shamefull spoile to lust, By my own death to quit my name from scandall; But providence determin'd better for me, And made me worth a strangers piety, Whom your chice meant the ruine of my honor; If this want entertainment in your faith, 'Tis peace to my poor heart that I have many White witnesses in Heaven. Cor. You have done no feats then? My wife is chast. Flo. I cannot sir engage My last breath to a nobler truth. Cor. 'Tis soâ Ex. Cla. You may withdraw Claudiana; by what Has been exprest, though I am satisfied, You are not guilty in the fact, as I Expected, 'tis not safe, when I consider My own fame in the story, that you live sir. I must not trust you longer with a secret That by my tamenesse may hereafter spread The infamy abroad: there's no avoidingâ Flo. Then I must die. Cor. Perhaps you have some hope This engine may deceive me, and my fortune Not coming better arm'd, give you the advantage To use your strength, upon my single person! I know you are active, but i'le make sure work. Ex. Flo. Till now I did not reach the precipice. My heart would mutinie, but my hands are naked, And can do nothing. Enter Cornari with Bravos arm'd. A knot of murderers! arme me with a sword, And let me die fighting against you all. I'le say y'are noble hangmen, and not throw One curse among you. Cor. I've one word to say sir. Let none approach, The fatall doom I threatned is revers'd; Throw off your wonder, and believe you may Live long, if not in Venice, and your safety Is more confirm'd at Distance, you are noble, An honor to your nation. Here is gold, I know not how you may be furnished sir For travell hence, bills of exchange may fail. These will defray a present charge; betray No wonder, take it. Flo. I'le accept your bounty, And will not ask to whom I owe all this, Forgive me that. I thought you not so honorable. So when you please, i'le take my leave. Cor. Not yet. By such attendants ss you came to me, I have provided sir for your departure. Your duties gentlemen. You know my purpose. The Bravos blind him, and bind him as before. Exeunt. Enter Claudiana. Cor. Resume thy place within my soul Claudiana, When I have done my sorrow for what's past Weel smile, and kisse for ever. Exeunt. Enter a Servant. Ser. A letter sir. Cor. From whence? Ser. Your Nephew now a Prisoner. Cor. Let him rot, and give 'em back the paperkite. Ser. The messenger is gone. Cor. Then he expects no answer. [Cor. ready] Cla. You may read it. Cor. Sir, I send not to you for reliefe, nor to Mediate my pardon. I have not liv'd after The rate to deserve your bread to feed me, Nor your breath to save me. I onely beg That you would put me into your prayers, And forgivenesse, and believe, I do not wish life, But to redeem my self from past impieties, And satisfie by a repentance the dishonors Have beene done to you, by the worst of men. Melipiero. This is not his usuall stile. Cla. This miracle may be. Cor. I do want faith. Cla. And sent a blessing to reward our penitence. Heaven has a spacious charity. Cor. Thou art all goodnesse. Ex. Enter the Bravos, they lay him down, and Exeunts Florelli recovers. Flo. Sure this is gold. Enter 3. gentlemen. Omnes. Florelli. Flo. The same. 1. Thy looks are wild. 2. Where in the name of wonder hast thou been? Flo. I am drop'd from the Moon. 3. The Moon. Flo. I was snatch'd up in a whirlwind, And din'd and sup'd at Cynthia's own table, Where I drank all your healths in Nectar gentlemen, Do yee want money? if you have a mind To return viceroyes, let's take shipping instantly. 1. And whither then? Flo. For new discoveries, A cloud will take us up at Sea. 2. 'Tis morning. Flo. To drink, and then aboord, no matter whither I'le keep this for a monument. 3. That bag? Flo. Do not profane it, 'twas Endimions pillow Stuffd with horne shavings of the Moon, it had The vertue when she clap'd it ore my head To bring me thence invisible through the air; The moon does mobble up her self sometime in't. Where she will shew a quarter face, and was The first that wore a black bag. 1. But dost hear? Flo. No inquisitions if you will leave Venice. Let's drink and spoon away with the next vessell. A hundred leagues hence, I may tell you wonders. Here is a chime to make Ring Oberon Queen Mab, and all her fayries turn o'th toe boyes. 2. Hee's mad I think. Exeunt. Enter Vrsula, Roberto, Giovanni. Vrs. I could not sleep all this night for dreaming, O' my poor suckling. Ro. peace I say and wait In silence Vrsula. Gio. You may excuse me yet. I wo'd not see his excellence. Vrs. 'Tis not my meaning boy, thou shouldst appear Unlesse there be necessity, you may stay, ith'e next Chamber. Enter a Courtier. Vrs. I beseech you Signior, is this grace coming forth. Cor. Not yet. Vrs. I have an humble sute, I must deliver A paper to his graces own hand, I hope his grace can read. Ex. Cl. Ro. Why how now bagpiper. Vrs. Nay, theres no harm in't what if he can, You will be talking, did not I say I would speak all my self. Ro. But Vrs. what do you think now will become on's When you have told your tale, though I am innocent. It will be no great credit, nor much comfort To see you whipt my Vrsula, I would Be sorry for my part to peep through a Pillory And have an even reckoning with my ears, Having no more hair to keep warm, and hide The poor concavities. Vrs. Never fear it husband. Ro. I will so curse you Vrsula, and once A day, bind your body to a pear tree, And thrash your hanches till you stink agen; For ought I know thou hast committed treason, Look to't, and bring me off with all my quarters If I be maim'd or cropt, I'le flea thee Vrsula, And stuffe thy skin with straw, and hang thee up To keep the fruit from Crowes, and after burn it. To kill the Caterpillars, come, be wise in time, And let Thomazo quietly be hang'd, Or headed yet, and talk no more, he is But one, and has a young neck to endure it. We are old, and sha'not shew with half the grace Without our heads, 'twill be a goodly sight To see our faces grin upon two poles, To tell the gaping world how we came thither To perch, and stink in unity, be wise, And leave Thomazo to the Law. Vrs. Can you be so uncharitable, oh Tyrant! Enter Duke, Marino. May it please your excellence, my husband and Myself. Ro. She has put me in already. Vrs. Humbly beseech a pardon for our son. Du. Your son Giovanni, where is he? Vrs. He waites in the next Chamber. Du. Call him in. What is the fact? It must be an offence next treason, if we Deny him pardon. Ro. I fear 'tis much about the matter. Du. What is the fact? Enter Giovanni. Vr. We do beseech you grant a pardon first, And then you shall know all. Du. That were preposterous justice. Why dost thou kneel Giovanni? Gio. To beg your mercy sir To him, for whom my mother kneeles Du. She askes thy pardon. Gio. Mine? Let me offend first. Du. Hee's innocent. Vr. No matter what he saies, my husband knowes it. Ro. Shee'l make sure of me. Vr. And if your highnesse will but grant the pardon, Your grace shall not repent, but thank me for The best discovery; i'le not bribe your excellence, But I will give you for it, what you'l hold As pretious as your Dukedome. Du. The old woman Raves, you had best send her to the house Of the insani. Ro. So shee's to be whip'd already, Du. What do you say Roberto! Ro. I say nothing, But that I think my wife will hardly mend upon't. Du. Upon what? Ro. On whipping, if it like your highnesse, She cannot feel those small corrections. I have taw'd hunting Poles, and hemp upon her, And yet could do no good. Ur. Let not your grace mind him, give me a pardon, And if I do not make good all my promise, You shall hang my husband, and flea me alive. Du. What's that paper? Ro. Ge't him, thou shouldst have done this afore. I am prepar'd, more bone and flesh upon me If the businesse come to hanging, were a curtesie. Urs. Nay 'tis there in black and white, you'l find it, Giovanni is your son, that was the Gardiner, And he that is in prison poor Thomazo My lawfully begotten. Du. Chang'd in their infancie. Urs. And since conceal'd out of ambition To see my own a great man. Ro. I feel the knot under my ear. Vr. I durst not trust my husband. Ro. That was not much amisse. Vrs. He has not wit enough to keep my secrets. Ro. Oh what a blessing has that man whose wife Knowes when to hold her peace. Mar. Sir, if we may compare their tracts of life, I shall believe your noblenesse liv'd there In Giovanni, not supprest in poverty, And their rude course condition, notwithstanding The helpes of Education, which seldome Do correct nature in Thomazo's low And abject spirit. Du. I'me too full, I must Disperse my swelling joyes or be dissolv'd, Summon our friends, invite Bellaura hither. Art thou my son? Gio. I would I were so blest. I ow'd you duty sir before, and now My knees encline with double force to humble The doubtfull Giovanni. Du. Let that name Be lost, take all my blessings in Thomazo. Vrs. What think you of this Roberto. Ro. Why? I think The Duke is mad, and when he finds his wits Hee'l hang us both yet. Du. Now I find the reason. And secret of my nature: but tell me What after so long silence, made you now Open the cloud that had conceal'd my son? Ro. I know not sirânow Ursula. Vr. The weaknesse of a woman, and a mother That would be loath to see her naturall child Dye like a bird upon a bough for treason, Nature will work, a mother is a mother, And your son, by the opening of this riddle Restor'd, I hope all shall be well agen. Ro. Would I were fair wash'd, yet out of my pickle. Vr. What think you now? Ro. I wish, I wish I could not think. Enter Senators, Cornari. Cor. We hear of wonders sir. Du. This is my son. Cor. With our most glad embraces let us hold you. Gio. Ever a servant to your gravities. Ro. The skie clears up. Enter Bellaura, Marino. Du. Bellaura, now receive not Giovanni, But Contarini's son my deer Thomazo. Bel. My heart hath wings to meet him. Tho. Oh my happinesse! Du. Pause a little. Ro. I melt agen Vrsula, the Duke points at us, And carries fireworks in his eyes, Du. Though we did grant a pardon for your son, You are subject to the censure of our lawes For this imposture. Ro. I knew 'twould come, now telltale, will you beg The favour we may hang till we be dead? Sweet Giovanni Thomazo speak for us, Not guilty my Lord, I am not guilty, Spare me, and let my wife be burn'd or hang'd, Or drown'd, or any thing you shall think fit, You shall find me reasonable, Who shall beg our pardon? Vr. Mercy oh mercy. Tho. Let me beseech you for their pardon sir. They alwaies us'd me civilly. Bel. Let me joine. Sen. And all of us, this is a day of triumph. Du. It shall be so. Ro. A Jubile, a Jubile, here comes Thomazo, I shall speak treason presently. Vrs. Now heaven preserve your sweet graces. Enter Thomazo, Malipiero. Gio. Mercy, oh mercy, my indulgent father. Vrs. Art thou come boy? Gio. Boy? stand away good woman. Vrs. I have procur'd thy pardon, mary have I child. Gio. I wo'd 'twere true, thou wert ever a loving Crone. Ro. You may believe her son. Gio. Son, the old fellow's mad. Urs. I say thou art pardon'd, You must kneel to me now, and this good Old man, and ask us blessing. Mar. Your name is prov'd Giovanni now, the Duke Has found another son. Gio. What shall become of me? Du. You shall be onely punish'd to return, And dig as he hath done, and change your name To Giovanni, nature was not willing You should forget your trade, where's my Thomazo? Gio. Are you my father? Ro. So my wife assures me. Gio. Are you my mother? Vrs. I my deere child. Gio. And you Signior Thomazo, that was I? Tho. And you Giovanni, with the inside outward Gio. And must I be a Gardiner? I am glad on't. Pray give me a couple of blessings, and a spade, And fico for this frippery. I'le thank My destiny that has yet kept my thread To a better use then hanging. Corn. Let nothing Of punishment profane this day, I must Implore your mercy upon this young man, Whose future life may recompence his past Impieties, and make him serviceable To honor and good men. Du. You shew a charity, If I have heard a truth in some sad stories, Hee's yours and pardon'd. Ma. Y'are a miracle Of goodnesse, 'tis too much to look upon, Whom I have with such impudence offended. Command me sir abroad untill by some Years well emploid, a pennance for my crimes I may be thought one worthy to be own'd Your Kinsman. Du. Agen; welcome my Thomazo, My dearest pledge, till now I was no father; In him, the want of hope my thoughts opprest, In thee my fortunes, and my name are blest. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
