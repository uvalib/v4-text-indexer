      <field name="fulltext">Act First. SCENE FIRST. The Antichamber to the Queen of Castile's Presence-Chamber, to which it opens by the Scene's dividing. DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA; (Enter opposite sides). D. LEONORA. Hail to my darling Child! This smiling morn Rises auspicious to behold my joy; This is the birth-day of thy regal power: And my child mounts this Day her Father's Throne. Revolted Arragon now courts thy sway, And with repentant heart, wrenching thy sceptre From Garcia's grasp, repairs its long rebellion. The Deputies ere noon will here arrive, From exile to recall thee, and restore, With signal honours, thy long ravish'd Kingdom: To swear allegiance, and to hail thee Queen. D. ELVIRA. Oh! may that Crown, which Heaven, this Day, restores me, Add to my Mother's bliss, as to her power; Though Queen, I still her subject shall remain. Her prudent counsels, and her wise resolves, Will sway and safely guide my youthful mind. This is indeed a Day of high import; Alike distinguish'd by eventful fate, To fix for Arragon, and rich Castile, A future Monarch on their envy'd Thrones. This Day the beauteous Isabella names The Husband of her choice, and crowns him King. D. LEONORA. O my Elvira! wouldst thou fix thy choice, And now select a partner of thy Throne; From anxious care my mind would be reliev'd. Troubles, from long misrule, will rise in Arragon; And I am all thy counsel, or defence: And can I on that Throne protect my Child, Which all her Father's valour fail'd to guard? A valiant Husband's arm would prop thy state; Disperse the mutinous, and quell rebellion. Let prudence plead the cause of love, Elvira! Reward the godlike passion of Alvarez, Who sought thy hand, whilst hopeless of a Crown. Now emulate the worth thy soul esteems; And generous in thy turn, be grateful too: Let thy first act, as Queen, be nobly just, Ascend thy Throne, and name Alvarez King. D. ELVIRA. Heaven well rewards his virtuous deeds to me. A Throne, more splendid far than mine, now courts him, With Isabella, in Castile to reign. The brave Castilians name him of the Three From whom they wish their Queen to chuse a Consort. First, my dear Mother! let me mount my throne, Before I fix with whom, that Throne to share. D. LEONORA. Ah! my foreboding fears! Your choice is made. Reflect, my Child! whilst yet the power remains, What grief, what dangers may await your love. Resist this fatal impulse of your heart, Which will embitter all your future life. Could my maternal bosom yield consent, Yet would the Nobles of your Realm submit To bow the knee to one, plebeian born? Too much, alas! the valiant Carlos charms you. But what avails his matchless worth? His blood Springs from some base, contaminated source, Which he, through pride, with conscious shame, conceals. D. ELVIRA. Yet, though conceal'd, its source may be most pure. For have not princes, men of high renown, Disguis'd themselves, their names, and birth deny'd. Whose swords alone have signaliz'd their fame; Subduing kingdoms, and bestowing crowns: Singly the fate of empires, and of kings. D. LEONORA. Is this the flattering hope your heart has cherish'd? And the distinction which you pay to Carlos, Is it then love, grafted on hope fallacious? Ah! my dear Child! give not such room for censure, Nor cherish sentiments, you must subdue. Avoid the converse which destroys your peace, And lends the venom'd tongue of slander, speech. D. ELVIRA. Such rare endowments, and such gallant worth, As Carlos owns, in noble minds, excite Esteem, complacent friendship, and urbanity. I but that tribute of regard bestow, Which his transcendent virtues justly claim; Chaste as a sister's innocent affection. Can this reflect upon my virgin fame, Or draw the breath of calumny against me? D. LEONORA. Beauty and youth, with princely rank combin'd, Winning admirers, draw observers too. The storm, unheeded, deluges the weed, Whilst, on the garden's pride, the peerless lily, And the sweet, opening rose, not unobserv'd Hang, e'en the freshning dew-drops of the morn. Carlos commands respect from ev'ry heart; And, did his merits less conspicuous shine, Your gentle soul uncensur'd might esteem him. But to each virtue, that adorns the man, A warrior's valour, and a hero's fame, He adds each striking, each attractive grace; Commanding, awful, yet inspiring love; In port a monarch, and in mind a god. When he appears, each eye with pride surveys him; All seem to take a fashion from his mien, And with complacent hope, admire their model. Though ev'ry lady courts him by her smiles, Whom has he yet distinguish'd but yourself? Save when he pays his duty to his Queen. In his attention you such pleasure take, That you betrayâmore than esteem for Carlos. D. ELVIRA. That homage which queens claim, does Carlos offer; He pays his court like others, who approach me; Worth, such as his, knows no temerity. D. LEONORA. With you to Arragon does Carlos go, Only to pay his court, as here he pays it? The worth he owns may make his thoughts aspire; And he, who guards your Throne, may hope your love. D. ELVIRA. War is the element of souls like his; From victory to victory they fly; Glory their idol, and their wish distinction. Seville dismantled, and the Moors defeated, Castile, triumphant, wants his arm no more. His great ambition, thus without an object Offers his sword against our Rebel, Garcia. His valour will achieve, what, with success, Our subjects have begun; chase this Usurper, And bid fair peace, and safety, grace my Throne. D. LEONORA. But, when his conqu'ring sword has fix'd your reign, Your subjugated Vassals at your feet, Will Carlos quit your Realm, to seek fresh toils; Nor hope that Crown, his valour may have sav'd?â D. ELVIRA. Madam! the Queen approaches to give audience. SCENE SECOND. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE. D. LEONORA. This Day then, Madam! this distinguish'd Day, You will reward some happy lover's flame? D. ISABELLA. I, at my People's prayer, proclaim a King: A Husband chuse, a partner of my Throne. D. ELVIRA. Alas! methinks my royal friend appears With more than usual sadness in her eye. Long has her heart conceal'd a load of grief, Refus'd to make me partner of the cause, And shunn'd my converse, save in hours of state. My joy, on this eventful Day, believe me, Will want its charms, if Isabella mourn; With such delight she hail'd my change of fortune, I thought, last night, that all her griefs were fled. D. ISABELLA. Still, my Elvira! does my heart rejoice In thy recover'd Crown; e'en whilst I sigh To lose the friend, I from my cradle lov'd. Thy joy alone can gladden my sad soul, Oppress'd, and harrass'd by corroding care. I sacrifice my peace this fatal Day; But to the State's repose, I yield my own. All the Grandees, ambitious of the Crown, Embroil, by their intrigues, the public peace. To terminate their feuds, I name a King: Castile, through all her States, conjures me to it. And, by my order, three Grandees elects, To one of whom, I this hour give my Throne. D. LEONORA. Three most renowned Heroes they elect; Don Manrique, Lopez, and the brave Alvarez, Though not of royal blood, are worthy thrones. D. ISABELLA. Ah! what to me avail the shouts of fame, Which hail them idols of the public choice, If of my heart, the gallant Don Alvarez, Lopez, nor Manrique, be the chosen lord? D. LEONORA. Though nam'd, to them your choice is not confin'd; Speak your heart's wish, your Vassals will obey. D. ISABELLA. Though born my Subjects, yet I am their Slave; And bound by laws Kings tremble to infringe. A royal rank imposes stern restraints; The hearts of Kings must neither love nor hate. I am less free than e'en my meanest subject; Chain'd by fastidious glory to her car, Which nice, imperious, jealous, honour guides: My heart must feel for others, not myself, Each wish ungratify'd, each grief disdain'dâ (Stops short.) (To Blanche, who speaks to an Attendant.) Are the States met? (Aside.) Oh! could this fatal Choice Be still delay'd, or never, never, made! Calm, gracious Heaven! this conflict of my soul, Direct my actions, and inspire my thoughts! (The scene dividing gives entrance into a magnificent Presence-Chamber. A royal throne under a canopy. Two chairs of state in a line with the throne. At the right-hand of the throne a small ornamented stand, higher than a table, upon which the Sceptre and Regalia are placed. Seats ranged on each side of the throne to the front of the stage: the Grandees &amp; Officers of the Spanish Court standing before them. The Royal Guards standing behind the seats. The Grandees take off their hats, and remain uncovered till the Queen has walked to the platform of the throne; and when she turns round and speaks, they put them on. Carlos only remains uncovered.) SCENE THIRD. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE, DON MANRIQUE, DON ALVAREZ, DON LOPEZ, CARLOS. Grandees, Officers of the Court, Guards, &amp;c. &amp;c. (The Queens go towards the throne, the Queen of Castile in the middle. At the foot of the platform, the Queen of Castile turns &amp; addresses the Court.) D. ISABELLA. Lopez, Alvarez, Manrique! whom my States Have nam'd as worthy to ascend my Throne! Before I grant their prayer, and name a Sovereign, Brave Counts! a solemn Oath, I ask from each. Swear, uncontested, to accept my choice; That the rejected Two, nay, all the Three, (If 'tis my pleasure to reject them all) Will, whom I name for King, own as his Master. My Right to chuse, my Lords! you must now recognise And swear to guard that Right inviolate, When I shall name my Husband and your King. Both of my Crown, and Self, I may dispose: I hold my State's Election as no law; Nor shall it subjugate my royal Will: Well pleas'd I view their justice to your worth, Showing their high esteem of your exploits; Which, though it shall not rule, may guide my choice. May Heaven's Omniscient Will illume my mind! Make me the agent of its high behests, That my now choice the worthiest may reward. (To the Grandees.) Ye Nobles of Castile! my People's Delegates! I grant their prayer. Own ye my royal Rights, That in myself alone resides the Power To chuse my Husband, and divide my Rule? (The whole Court, each having his right hand on his heart, bow assenting.) (To the Counts.) These Rights, thus recognis'd, swear Counts! to guard. D. LOPEZ. Unquestion'd, unoppos'd, I swear to guard them. Your States but supplicate, nor mean restraint; And in obedience solely to your Will, Have they made known their sentiments of us. Not from their favour, but your own free choice, Do I presuming think to gain your hand: An honour which I scarcely dare to hope, But as a bliss unmerited is hop'd for. I own your Power to give, without control, That hand, which monarchs proudly might dispute, E'en to the meanest subject in Castile. Yet this unprecedented grace I trust, Will on the least unworthy be conferr'd: Justice and prudence must inform your judgment, That to use all your power may not behove you. Such, Madam! are my thoughts. D. ISABELLA. Speak yours, Don Manrique! D. MANRIQUE. Though, madam! your discourse schools us to fear, And inly breeds suspicion in our minds, Yet, I attest your Right, and own your Power, To chuse a Husband, and to bid him reign. Long ere you grac'd a Throne, my soul ador'd you: The King your Brother, my lamented Master, Deign'd on my love to smile, and bade me hope. Fondly my heart the flattering thought has cherish'd, That four whole years of anxious, constant love, At last, may win your pity and regard. Yet if, in this sweet hope, my mind deceive me, I swear, since you demand this test of fealty, Though to despair you doom my faithful heart, That He, whom your free choice pronounces bless'd, I, as my King, and Master, will obey, Protect his person, and support his power, With warmest zeal, and constant, firm allegiance. D. ISABELLA. Brave, Don Alvarez! what is your resolve? D. ALVAREZ. I will not be importunate in speech: Chuse of us Three, or make another choice, I swear, implicitly, t'obey your will. D. ISABELLA (smiling). Beneath this deference, this profound respect, We spy the leaven of conceal'd indifference; And as your heart sighs for another's charms, 'Tis thus, on both sides, that you homage pay. D. ALVAREZ. Madam! D. ISABELLA. A truce, my Lord! (Donna Isabella mounts the step of the platform, and seats herself upon the throne. The Queens of Arragon mount the platform, and seat themselves. The Dowager Queen Leonora on the righthand side of the throne, and Elvira on the left. D. ISABELLA. Let each take place. (The Three Counts, and the Grandees, who form the Court, seat themselves on the seats prepared for them. Don Lopez on the right-hand side of the throne, Don Alvarez and Don Manrique on the left. Carlos, who stands on the right-hand side of the throne, in a line with the Grandees, but below them, nearest the audience, seeing a place unoccupied, next to Don Lopez, near to whom he stands, seats himself. Don Manrique rising, steps from his rank, and speaking, Carlos rises. Don Lopez rises, the instant Carlos attempts to seat himself. D. MANRIQUE. Rise, Carlos, rise! Whence such audacity? D. LOPEZ. What title have you to assume this rank, And seat yourself with the Grandees of Spain? CARLOS. Vacant the place, my Lords! and as in camps, So oft in council, with my King, I sat, I thought in courts to fill a place as well. D. MANRIQUE. A Soldier! to usurp the rank of Count? The favours of your Prince make you forgetful. CARLOS. Think me not, Count, asham'd of what I am; Nor yet forgetful of what first you knew me. Soldier's a title for a Prince to boast. Carlos, though now he holds a General's truncheon, Remembers, that five years are not elaps'd Since, as a Soldier, in the common ranks, He fought unnotic'd, and without distinction: One of that mass whose valour gains the war; Whilst he who leads, claims all the wreath of fame. The late good King, your royal Master, Lords! Who knew my deeds, from rank to rank promoted me. He thought, that I had earn'd my General's staff. If otherwise you judge, the time is come, When Sovereign Power may give you to reclaim it. D. MANRIQUE. Presumptuous Carlos! how dares your arrogance A second time offend? Was't not enough To rank yourself with our Nobility, That, when rebuk'd, you dare our justice question? Had I, or brave Don Lopez, now the power, We should disdain to take your honours from you. Deeds, which will grace our history's future page, Deeds, but acknowledg'd, not rewarded yet, Your godlike arm, invincible, has done. The Royal Standard of Castile was taken In the King's sight; your youthful arm redeem'd it. This perilous action turn'd the tide of battle, Inspir'd our troops with courage to drive back The conqu'ring Moors, e'en to their rocky fastness; Till from the vanquish'd, we became the vanquishers. CARLOS. My Lord! I ask you not to word my deeds; A Soldier glories more to act, than vaunt them. D. MANRIQUE. Unask'd I speak them; to convince your pride, I bear no envy to the worth I value. From chains you sav'd the King in Andalusia: When pierc'd with wounds, upon a heap of dead, Your body was so long his shield, his troops Gain'd time to rally; those foes, who hemm'd him in, Were sacrific'd; and the same squadron, which went To rescue him, a victor brought him back, And you almost expiring. You mounted first Upon the walls of Seville, slew Roderigo, And maintain'd the breach, whilst the Castilians enter'd; Then, at their head, storm'd the strong citadel, And forc'd its gates. Of many great exploits These are but some. Don Lopez and myself, To you indebted stand for life and liberty: For, when surrounded by triumphant Moors, Then, when we trembled, prisoners to their arms, By you our Guardian Genius bade them fall, Fate to our foes, and providence to us; You conquer'd numbers, to redeem us bled. CARLOS. My soul rejoic'd to aid the valiant's cause. 'T was but a Soldier's part I did, brave Count! And, had your fate been mine, yourself or Lopez, Would have done more, to guard my life or liberty. D. MANRIQUE. To speak your worth is due to my own honour, Lest I be thought invidious of your glory. Your rank, and not your courage I dispute; I think your valour has not had its meed; The late King promis'd to reward it further, But death surpriz'd him just as he resolv'd it. D. ISABELLA. I, Carlos! who his crown inherit, take His debt on me; and amply will repay you. My Brother held you high in his esteem; He thought few equal, in his court, to Carlos, For valour in the field; or in the council, For wisdom, prudence, and distinguish'd vigour.â Counts! let this difference end! Be seated, Carlos! D. LOPEZ. Ere he takes Rank with the Grandees of Spain, First, Madam! order him to name his Family. We, in no wise, contest his bravery, Supernal power hath nerv'd his youthful arm, To achieve such deeds, as would become a god: Let him declare his race and genealogy; His lineage state; for valour without birth, Had never right to occupy such place. CARLOS. Let him who wills boast honours others earn'd. I will owe nought to those who gave me life. I'd rather equal CÃ¦sar in the field, Than trace my lineage to the Julian Race. What do we know of Macedonia's Kings, Worthy record, till Philip rose in arms, And Alexander triumph'd o'er the world.â Hereditary honours I disdain; And know, proud Counts! I would not give the name My sword has earn'd, to be Medina's Duke, E'en though Don Manrique's blood enrich'd his veins. I claim no parents, but my past exploits; My valour be my Race. My arm my Lineage. D. LOPEZ. The proof is clear, that Carlos is not Noble. D. ISABELLA. Then I, whose Son soe'er he be, or what His Race, ennoble him. Contest no more! D. MANRIQUE. Permit me yet one wordâ D. ISABELLA. Not one, Don Manrique! For this audacity assumes too much. Must I have leave from you to ennoble Carlos? D. MANRIQUE. No!âbut that place is due to highest dignities; And, though ennobled, Carlos cannot take it, 'T is sacred to the High Grandees of Spain; One less than Count, or Marquis, would profane it. D. ISABELLA. Henceforth then, Carlos! Marquis of Santillane, Count of Pennafiel, and Governor of Burgos, Your titles claim. Don Carlos! I create thee One of the High Grandees. Assert your Privilegeâ (He puts on his hat.) And take your Rankâ (He seats himself.) Is this enough, Don Manrique! To give him privilege to take that place? Does there remain one scruple in your mind? D. MANRIQUE. Madam! complete your work, and make him King. To grace him by such dignities, is less To equal him to us, than to exalt Carlos, To your own Rank. Your skilful prelude, Princess! And those exacted Oaths, we have just sworn, Show that your heart has made its choice of Carlos: We, bound by vows, must ratify that choice; I shall obey, nor aught attempt against it. To him, I here resign, You and your Kingdom: I quit your presence, ere you make him King; Not as one jealous at it, but through fear, Lest for You, Queen! I blush, when you shall name him. (Going.) (The Queen rises precipitately from her throne, and descends from the platform; the whole Court rises. The Queens of Arragon remain standing upon the platform. Donna Elvira is much agitated during the last speech; when risen, she leans for support upon her chair, her Mother observes her very attentively.) D. ISABELLA (with anger). Stay, Insolent!â (D. Manrique returns.) (Recovering her temper.) Your Queen forgives you, Manrique! What an unworthy fear, imprudently suspects; To silence which, I condescend so far, As to declare, that in my States' just choice, I acquiesce; that youâstill hold the rank You held in my esteem; and I attribute, This fiery transport to excess of love. Injurious as it is, I pardon it; Ere your reflection pleads for love's offence. D. MANRIQUE. Your conduct, Queen! gave rise to my offence. Honours so lavish'd, warranted suspicion: Excuse too, Madam! some antipathyâ D. ISABELLA. Forbear, to justify your insolent pride! Though pardon'd, Manrique! it shall learn humility. My sacred Rights, as woman, and as Queen, You have profan'd with impious disrespect; Slander'd my conduct, and my power insulted. Grant that I Carlos love; or that I solely, Through pure esteem, pay tribute to his worth; Raising his Rank above your lordly scorn; Whate'er be my design, you should respect, Either, the choice my heart has made; or what My power creates; and, will support, proud Vassal!! To curb your scorn, still higher will I raise him, Grant him prerogative beyond my own; Myself and Crown, I to his power intrust; I made Him Marquis, He shall name a King. You own his merit, he shall judge of yours. (To Don Carlos.) Twice has your arm redeem'd my throne and kingdom: Now let your wisdom like your valour shine, And worthily bestow the Crown you sav'd. (Advancing a step or two towards Don Carlos, and presenting her ring to him.) Lord Marquis! take my Ring. And, as your testimony, On the most worthy of these Three bestow it, And hail him King.âWhat of this Day remains Is yours, to weigh their merits, and reward them. Ambitious Rivals! pay your court to him: He who presents me with my Ring from Carlos, Shall instantly receive my hand and Crown. Queens! let us go, and leave them to determine, To whom, in preference, I would give my Kingdom. (The Queens retire; the scene closes upon the Court, leaving the three Counts and Carlos at the front of the stage.) SCENE FOURTH. DON MANRIQUE, DON ALVAREZ, DON LOPEZ, DON CARLOS. D. LOPEZ (ironically). Will, my Lord Marquis! deign to inform his suppliants, What may be requisite to win his favour? He is our judge, he therefore must be soften'd. D. CARLOS. This ill-plac'd raillery is most unseemly. D. MANRIQUE. To supplicate You, Carlos! is unseemly. D. CARLOS. A truce with raillery, or supplication, Lords! Let us continue friends. Well will I use The trust, the Queen has in my hands repos'd; Nor shall you, Counts! complain of my decision; For I refuse to be the Judge myself. I give you one, that it will be dishonour, But to suspect. The impartial Sword, brave Lords! A Queen and Kingdom on this Ring depend; Both are well worth the contest, you have courage;â I guard this Ring. (Carlos puts it upon his finger.) D. LOPEZ. And, for whom guard it, Carlos? D. CARLOS. My vanquisher.âHe who can take it from me, Pledge of his worth, shall to the Queen present it. The order, time, and place, amongst yourselves Agree; I will await your summons, and obey it. SCENE FIFTH. DON MANRIQUE, DON ALVAREZ, DON LOPEZ. D. MANRIQUE. Think of his arrogance! D. ALVAREZ. 'T is thus a soul, By valour nobly form'd, repels an outrage. D. MANRIQUE. If he expect to measure Swords with us, His pride has most egregiously deceiv'd him. D. ALVAREZ. Refuse a challenge? D. MANRIQUE. Yes: beneath our rank. Grandees of Spain, all jealous of their honour, Do not expose their lives to bold adventurers. D. ALVAREZ. How can you thus degrade a valiant warrior? Nay, were he what your hatred has presum'd, We ought to treat him, as the Queen has rank'd him. D. LOPEZ. When the Queen braves us, nor regards our blood! But dares the lustre of our Rank to tarnish, Raising this Minion to an equal rank? D. ALVAREZ. Are Kings accountable for whom they title? Our equals flourish, or neglected fade, Just as their pleasure wills. D. MANRIQUE. My Lord! you're politic, In the respect you pay to majesty: But own your thoughts, do you not judge she loves him, That, had she dar'd, she would have nam'd him King? Were not her speeches artful, and mysterious? D. ALVAREZ. You show'd such high disdain of valiant Carlos, And, with such contumacy, brav'd the Queen, Arraign'd her conduct, and her power disputed, She was constrain'd to go the lengths she did; Or yield her dignity, forego her power, Desert the brave, and side with his high scorners. You piqued her pride, her sex's niceness wounded; Your speech indelicate, and haughty carriage, Were more than Queen, or Woman, ought to bear. Would you, my Lord! be by your vassal brav'd, Having the power to humble him to earth? Would you not use that power, till his pride yielded, Subordinate to reason and respect? D. MANRIQUE. My Lord! you are a warm apologist: But are you friend, or lover, in this cause? Do you indeed pretend to Isabella? 'T is said, that Arragon's fair Queen has charmsâ D. ALVAREZ. Her charms are not the subject of discussion. My Country honours me with that esteem, To think me worthy to become its King; Grateful for this, and my own fame respecting, I will not, Counts! refuse the grace it shews me. I therefore with the Marquis, brave Don Carlos, Will measure swords; nor think my Rank dishonour'd. If, from his valour, I can win the Ring, Then, Lords! with you, I will contest the Crown. D. LOPEZ. Gladly with you, we shall dispute this prize, You are a rival worthy of our swords; But for this Marquis, he must seek his equals. (Exeunt severally. Don Alvarez the same way that Don Carlos went; Don Carlos went; Don Manrique and Don Lopez at the opposite side.) End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act Second. SCENE FIRST âA ROOM OF STATE. DONNA ISABELLA, BLANCHE. D. ISABELLA (seated on a sofa). I pray thee, Blanche, retire! BLANCHE. Insist not, Madam! I cannot leave you thus. D. ISABELLA. Why wilt thou stay?â I blush that mortal should behold my tears, Or view the pangs, that rend my anguish'd heart. Thy feeble pity cannot change my fate, Nor thy calm reason argue me to peace: (Rising.) For I am doom'd to feed a hopeless flame. Is this to be a Queen? Ah! dear-bought greatness! A Queen! A wretch in state! chain'd down by prejudice; A pageant slave! a vassal to a throne, Great but for others, powerless for myself. BLANCHE. Madam, control this grief! think of your Rankâ D. ISABELLA. Rank! can it root out passion from my soul, And change my mould of mind? annihilate The softness from my heart, the cherish'd thoughts, The oft-recurring hopes of fabled bliss, I have so fondly form'd, but must not share?â Pride, guard my mind! and apathy, my heart! And let my feelings with my fate agree. BLANCHE. O Madam! how I trembled for your glory; For, from the Oath you made your lovers swear, I thought you fix'd to give your Crown to Carlos. But you have nobly conquer'd your own heart, Whilst you sustain'd your regal dignity. D. ISABELLA. Say rather, Blanche! that Love usurp'd my throne, And with a monarch's wrath aveng'd my lover. I thought that I was master o'er my heart; I had not plann'd to act, as thou hast seen me, Although I mean'd to honour Carlos highly: I only will'd to try the Counts' respect, And to secure my power, and royal Rights. For, as, alas! this choice was dreaded by me, It seem'd like a relief, a sort of pleasure, To lose a little time, to loiter lingering, Thus to retard my doom, and put off fate. Yet I was going to nameâI had no choiceâ And could Don Manrique have restrain'd his pride, Castile perhaps, ere this, had hail'd him King. He urg'd my temper to its utmost bearing; And scarcely I refrain'd from naming Carlos, To gall his pride, for daring to insult me. BLANCHE. I marvel not that you chastise his insolence, Which on you cast such shame, and rude reproach. D. ISABELLA. Under the specious plea, to avenge my power, Love found a fair pretence to scatter favours. I have made Carlos, Marquis, Count, and Governor; Oh! with what joy could I have hail'd him King! How my heart pleaded! Yet by these profusions, I thought to satisfy and silence it; For to pronounce against him much distress'd me; And, when I bade him give away my Crown, 'Twas only, that he might himself exclude. I parley'd with my power to soothe my heart; And did an outrage, where I seem'd to honour. BLANCHE. Fearing to make him King, you make him more. D. ISABELLA. My heart, indifferent to all the Three, Thought, that it best could like, whom Carlos chose; This sudden fancy sway'd my conduct, Blanche. But now I wish I had repress'd the thought, And humbled Manrique by some other means. For I have err'd in making Carlos Judge; He bids the sword decide. Ah! does he hope To gain me thus himself? Does he then love me?â I dare not trust my thoughts that dangerous length. I must prevent the sword from being drawn, And, by my choice, stifle these dreaded feuds. BLANCHE. 'Twill be an arduous task to wrench the sword From valour's hand, when custom bids it grasp it. He who retracts is ignominious held, And honour, to great souls, is more than life. D. ISABELLA. I would not so disgrace my power to affront, That valour I admire. For when obedience Is by dishonour stain'd, kings go too far, And undermine their own omnipotence. Feigning to grant, I will prevent this combat: If they remit it, then I hold it broken. See, Carlos, to obey my order, comes. (Exit Blanche.) SCENE SECOND. DONNA ISABELLA, DON CARLOS. D. ISABELLA. Marquis! Castile has by your arm been sav'd: Its gratitude I till this Day reserv'd, To make its favours more conspicuous shine, Granted in full assembly of my States. Much has it griev'd me, when I mean'd reward, But to stand forth the champion of your worth: And, ere my purpose to yourself was known, To have those honours, to your merit due, Extorted as an act of justice from me; As if I wanted soul, in virtue's cause, Freely to pay, where I indebted stood, For services almost beyond reward.â Yet, whilst I own no recompense can reach them, I trust that I have shown I prize your virtues. Spite of that envy which pursues your merit, I, unsolicited, have rais'd your fortune: Yet, if not equal to your just ambition, If other recompense you hop'd, or wish for, Speak! to your own content I will oblige you. D. CARLOS. My Queen's exalted spirit has bestow'd Such high, such full-blown honours, as my soul Dar'd not in thought conceive: far less expect. Troubled, amaz'd, confus'd, o'erwhelm'd, with bounty, Let her not think, I have one wish ungratify'd. D. ISABELLA. Yet, when above your hopes I raise your fortune, Grace and distinguish you with all my favour, Lean on your judgment, with a sister's confidence, You give me, Marquis! reason for complaint. D. CARLOS. How, Madam! have I sinn'd? D. ISABELLA. Your sword is rais'd Against the State's repose, and against mine. The strongest pillars of the State, are Manrique, Lopez and Alvarez; in them you undermine it; In them you seek to shed its purest blood. Think to what height my people prize these Counts, Since worthy, each is deem'd, to share my Throne. D. CARLOS. Madam!âthis blameâ D. ISABELLA. My Lord! when thus I censure you, And to yourself, whate'er complaint I make, Such frankness tells in what esteem I hold you; I would prevent you from incurring blame; Guarding your honour thus, I mean you favour.â Your pride, against the Counts; has arm'd your vengeance; There was no need, my Lord! to draw your sword; I had aveng'd the insult you sustain'd, Nor did I leave your triumph incomplete, When I deputed you to give my diadem. I made you the Counts' Judge, but not their foe; Bidding the sword decide, you much mistake me. D. CARLOS. Then has my judgment, not my duty err'd: Only my courage do the Counts allow me; Therefore in that I humbly put my trust, To prove who worthiestâ D. ISABELLA (interrupting him). Did you then hope, If o'er all Three your prowess gave you 'vantage, It would be said, chusing Castile a King, The State could find none to compare with you?â If thus presumptuous, and thus vain, I thought youâ (Stops short.) D. CARLOS (kneeling, after a moment's pause). Oh! spare the injurious accusation, Madam!â If you repent your favours, Gracious Queen! My ruin is no difficult achievement. Yet do not charge me with unthought-of crimes; Nor arm your anger with unjust suspicions. (The Queen signs to him to rise.) I love you, Queen! but with a flame as pure, As from the hallow'd sacrifice ascends: As we love honour, virtue, Heaven itself.â And if the matchless lustre of my Sovereign Dazzles a moment my enchanted soul, Sudden it back returns, and downcast shrinks Into itself. Ambitious sighs, vain hopes, And criminal desires, I never breath'd. D. ISABELLA. 'Tis well:âI find myself mistaking, Carlos! D. CARLOS. I, Madam; only as a Queen can love you. For, should unhallow'd passion, rise within My guilty breast, should you (O, pardon, Princess! The impious thought) should you, so far forget Your sacred self, and what you owe your rank, As to partake the passion you inspir'd, And suffer me to breathe my vows before you; If, by some fatal fascination curs'd, Your sensibility should so degrade you, As to descend, e'en from your Throne, to me, Know my esteem would instantly decrease; And my love, rais'd on that, would soon expire. D. ISABELLA. Marquis! your thoughts are worthy a great soul. D. CARLOS. Your glory, Madam! is my heart's first object. In combating the Counts I have no wish, But to make known him, who deserves you most. Ill should I answer your high confidence, If only on my judgment I depended, To chuse your Spouse and partner of your Throne.â All-seeing power! direct the sword of him, Who best deserves her, through my ready heart! D. ISABELLA. Carlos! forbear; nor interest Heaven itself, Against my peace!âWhy must the Sword decide?â âBlushing with shame, at weakness unsubdu'd, I own I love one of the purpos'd combatants. Yet should I not have nam'd whom I prefer; For though I love, my Country's good outweighs My tenderest thoughts, my heart foregoes its choice, And seeks the Hero who deserves to reign; And by my subjects' will be most approv'd. After Don Manrique's most opprobrious insolence, Fearing my partial heart might sway my judgment, To yours I trusted, and consign'd my Crown: Not thinking you would bid the sword decide, And harrass, with new woes, my wounded peace. Carlos! respect his life whom I esteem: Reflect how hard his fate to lose a Throne. Respect the sufferings of my sorrowing soul, Torn, for my People's good, from him I love; Let me not have to mourn his hapless death, With poignant anguish, never-ending tears. D. CARLOS. O Queen! I would not dare to wrest your confidence, Guessing the secret which your scruples veil; Nor solve the mystery hidden beneath your words. Yet hear your faithful Servant, gracious Princess! Trust me, such equal heroes are these Counts, On your heart's choice you safely may rely.â Why then reject, with cruel heroism, The good which Heaven has plac'd within your reach? Let not the thirst of glory now deceive you; It soon will pall; and to vacuity Will leave your heart, or else a prey to grief. Did virtue claim the purpos'd sacrifice, That motive, in full force, would constant last, And lenient sooth at once, and heal your mind. O! dread the agony of hopeless passion! It steeps the warrior's manly cheek in tears, And makes him joyless, though with laurels grac'd. Brave not this ceaseless torment of the soul: It is the baleful poison of sweet peace, No balm can medicate, no time assuage; To which, night brings no sleep, nor day-spring joy. âO Heaven! instruct me in which happy lover, I may revere my gracious, royal Mistress, That by an easy, and a sudden victoryâ D. ISABELLA. It must not be.âIf through respect for me, One of the Three you spare, you give the prize; You make me Judge.âI dare not, must not chuse.â You urge me, Carlos! to the brink of fate;â You add fresh conflicts to an o'ercharg'd heart:â Your eager valour hazards all my peace, Heedless you pierce my heart with wounds immedicableâ (Turns from D. Carlos to hide her emotion.) I would avoid discussion on this subjectâ âThough, as a Queen, I might forbid these combats, I will not wound your honour, nor the Counts; The Lists shall be prepar'd, the challenge held: Who of the Three is first to try his fortune? D. CARLOS (observing the Queen). Alvarez, Madam! D. ISABELLA. He for another sighs! D. CARLOS. Yet He alone the glorious prize contests. D. ISABELLA. Gallant Alvarez! first, though thou lov'st me not? To-morrow shall his courage be display'd. D. CARLOS. This day, the challenge of Alvarez names. D. ISABELLA. If I consent not, what avails his challenge? On your allegiance be it then deferr'd. Carlos adieu!âRespect my prohibition! SCENE THIRD. D. CARLOS (alone). Defer the fight! Is not my valour stain'd By this command? And will not honour blush? Has the Queen right to give me law? Am I Her Subject? No: I was born in Arragon.â Heavens! I remember that, and dare stand here, Count,âMarquis,âGovernor of Burgos too,â Yet know myself born of the meanest race; Only the Son of a poor, peasant Shepherd; Taught by a pious Priest through charity; Till learning made me wild with mad ambition, To act the heroic deeds, I joy'd to read. Oh! should these Lords discover my mean birth, With what insatiate scorn would they exult: How would my royal Mistress blush disdainful; And sweet Elvira then reject my sword, Nor own my arm to prop her tottering Throne. Cruel remembrance of my original self! Cease! cease! to haunt, and terrify my mind!â Kings were once chosen from victorious soldiers: Who serves his Country needs no ancestry; For, like the Sun, He gives, not borrows, light. My Cottage blood has been exhausted all, In glory's field, no drop of it remains: But it has bought me all my soul holds dear, The palm of victory, and the wreath of fame. Behold she comes! my rightful unown'd Queen! SCENE FOURTH. DONNA ELVIRA, DON CARLOS. D. ELVIRA. Ah! Carlos! scarcely can I call you Marquis, (Although you merit your exalted rank, But then I wish'd myself to raise you to it); Why have the charms of glory, thus seduc'd Your wavering honour, to desert that cause, To which your faith was pledg'd, your sword devote? Your valour should compel the rebel Garcia To yield obedience to my sovereign sway: Your sword held ready till I bade it strike, To place my long-lost sceptre in my hand. Yet, Count! and with that self-same sword, your faith To me engag'd, you undertake to fight Three single combats, which are not for me. You have forgotten, Count! what Carlos promis'd. Back to the Queen resign Penafiel, Burgos, and Santillane. For, trust me, Arragon Shall grateful give you more than you refuse. D. CARLOS. Either as Carlos, or as Marquis, Madam! I, nor forget, nor will desert your rights; The traitor Garcia shall your victim fall. Yet, though this sacrifice I owe to you, The Queen, in gratitude, first claims my sword; And highly it behoves the favour'd Marquis, To pay the mighty debt of humble Carlos, And to resent the outrage done the Queen. D. ELVIRA. Did she intrust her ring with that intent? D. CARLOS. When your bright Sex, insulted, wants a champion, Forbid it honour, glory, courage, manhood, That they should need to stoop to ask for aid; Or intimate the means to right their cause. D. ELVIRA. I think these combats might have been avoided, Unless the Counts had challeng'd you in arms. D. CARLOS. Then had I been ungrateful, and dishonour'd. Could disrespect assume an air more taunting, Than to assert, with scornful insolence, That her high heart indulg'd a secret passion, Unworthy of herself? Manrique averr'd it; And infamy would blot my name with cowardice, Not to stand forth in her most sacred cause, When duty, honour, gratitude, command it. My royal Mistress, in protecting me, Incurr'd this insult by her noble spirit; Sdeigning submission still the Count defy'd her, Forcing her new restrictions to invent, Or tamely shrink, insulted on her throne. I must protect her rights, assert her power, Maintain her cause, her injuries avenge; That done, my sword, with heartfelt zeal, is yours. D. ELVIRA. Carlos! I comprehend, from this excuse, That the Queen's service is preferr'd to mine; Because her subject, you break faith with me. D. CARLOS. For her, or you, I feel an equal zeal; Your cause, or hers, is mine. Nor have I seen Aught yet, of sleepless toil, or perilous hazard, But what for either I would wish to encounter. Nay, though engag'd to fight for her to-morrow, Sustain'd you wrong, which this day call'd for vengeance, Instant would I expose my breast, to more Than Three such combats in your cause, Elvira! Without reflecting what I ow'd the Queen. Misconstrue not the conduct which I hold, Nor wound my soul by undeserv'd reproaches. Know the high rank to which the Queen has rais'd me, Has but One charm for Me. But as your champion, Donna Elvira! are those honours priz'd, Which, in the eye of undiscerning crowds, Will give respect to him who fights your battles, Beyond what unplum'd courage ever meets. D. ELVIRA. To grace my cause, I wanted but your valour; I can invest you with still higher honours, Them, Marquis! you disdain, and me betray. D. CARLOS. I wish'd but one reward from bright Elvira; I thought it mine;âbut find myself deceiv'd. D. ELVIRA. Deceiv'd, my Lord! by whom? D. CARLOS. My own vain thoughts;â For, from your gentle manners, I presum'd, That in esteem you held the humble Carlos; That in your breast such hallow'd friendship dwelt, As pure Religion, with all-healing balm, Tells us the blest, in the next world, enjoy; Where all distinctions cease of earthly rank. But I was mock'd with visionary joy; The Queen of Arragon suspects my zeal, Changes the sweet complacence of her temper, For dark distrust, anger, and keen reproach. My mind feels anguish, all unknown before; A comfortless dismay subdues my spirit; Joyless, forlorn, and desolate I seem; As if my Guardian Angel left his charge, And ev'ry cheering passion join'd his flight. D. ELVIRA. If I be chang'd, your conduct wrought the change: Anger, suspicion, and reproaches, Carlos! Are not the natives of Elvira's breast. Your instability excites them all; Glory allures you to forget your faith, Which, uncondition'd, Marquis! Carlos promis'd. My friendship brooks not this, nor my esteem.â I hear Alvarez enters first the Lists: You know the history of his faithful love. D. CARLOS. Over Alvarez' soul I know your power; His virtues make him worthy of your heart. D. ELVIRA. When you fight with him, think of whom I love; And be his blood respected as your own. D. CARLOS. Do you command me then to make him King? D. ELVIRA. I only ask, that you would think of me. I go, in hopes of justice from the Queen; And, if I can, these combats to prevent. (Exeunt severally.) End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act Third. SCENE FIRST. DONNA ELVIRA, DON ALVAREZ. D. ELVIRA. Forbear, my Lord! and chuse some other theme. How dare you to pretend you love me still, When in the Lists you fight to gain the Queen? What star malevolent thus rules your fate, Making your arm a traitor to your heart? D. ALVAREZ. Imperious honour claims excuse from love. D. ELVIRA. A lover's honour is fidelity. My Lord! you now can have no hopes from me: To what does your ambitious heart pretend? D. ALVAREZ. That you should pity a poor wretch's fate, Your cruelty involves in such distress. Oh! could my faithful love have won your heart, This fatal honour never had been mine: The States would not have nam'd me as a suitor, Nor forced me, by their choice, to woo the Queen. Oh, would to Heaven! that I may either die, Or win the Queen, but to acquire Elvira. D. ELVIRA. Vain are your prayers to wish for miracles. Embrace the glittering prize which fortune offers; So much to your advantage is the change, That it wipes off, that censure, and disgrace, Which levity and fickleness excite. But yet beware, Alvarez! that brave Carlos, Does not avenge me, to your glory's downfall; And make your pride repent of this desertion. D. ALVAREZ. Princess! this forc'd desertion more befriends me, Than have whole years of persevering love: When honour forces me to break my chains, How I rejoice to be so much esteem'd, As to excite your anger, and resentment. D. ELVIRA. Count! you mistake the source of my displeasure. Much it offends me, that you still persist To persecute my heart, when you forsake me: And, that you term my coldness cruelty. Hope, gave I none, nor sought to gain that love, I fear'd my unwilling heart could never share. I own, with gratitude, your generous services, When Heaven's inflictions did most sore beset me. My best esteem must be your sole reward: A heart magnanimous expects no more; Nor seeks it to enslave, whom it has serv'd. D. ALVAREZ. Ah! think me not so mean of soul, to plead Those services, your sacred Sex commands From valour's arm; which I triumphant paid you. All the poor merit, that Alvarez claims, Is from try'd love, and constant adoration: Too happy had I been, could these have won you. D. ELVIRA. No Consort will I chuse, till I am Queen. The nuptial tie, no hero shall involve In my disastrous fortunes, to his ruin. Europe, through all her States, has no alliance For Isabel, or me; no King, nor Prince, Whose power might safely combat for my Kingdom. And, should my present shining prospects fade, Had I the meanness to accept your hand, My Wars would drain the treasures of your House: For when contending Monarchs play for Empires, The noblest fortune scarcely pays one stake.â An undisputed, and more splendid Throne Presents itself to your unsteady love; Willing, perhaps, it found your heart to share it. D. ALVAREZ. No! 'T was your cruelty expos'd me to it. When on a rock you drive me to destruction, Then you revile the shipwreck you have caus'd. D. ELVIRA. I blame you not, that you accept this fortune; More favour'd lovers might have listen'd to it. Yet, be what will the motives of your conduct, With much less warmth it might have been embrac'd: But you fight first, and, this impatient zeal, Proclaims, with how much joy, you break the chains, Of ill-requited love, and gain your liberty. D. ALVAREZ. How! could you bear the people should behold Your lover, the most cowardly of the Three? Not daring to attack this glorious Carlos, Till first his rivals had his force exhausted? D. ELVIRA. Those rivals come, with them, my Lord, I leave you! (Exit D. Elvira.) SCENE SECOND. DON MANRIQUE, DON ALVAREZ, DON LOPEZ. D. MANRIQUE. Which treats you best, Alvarez! Love or Fortune? Can the Queen charm so near the bright Elvira? D. ALVAREZ. When I have won the Ring, I will declare. D. LOPEZ. 'T is thought, that Carlos rivals you in both; And gives you cause for jealousy's keen pangs. D. ALVAREZ. He makes more jealous than myself, I fear.â D. LOPEZ. Through pity, he should yield you one, or t'other, Ending the contest, who shall make him King. The fair Castile, and Arragon both wish it; Two Queens, in beauty's prime, both sigh for Carlos. D. ALVAREZ. Then let that thought our lofty spirits humble: Though pride, and honour, storm with giant strength, Love gives the palm, where justice might decree it. D. MANRIQUE. Yet you defy this idol of your praise. D. ALVAREZ. My Lord! my honour is distinct from pride: Honour impels me to demand the Lists; And pride alone could make me scorn brave Carlos. D. MANRIQUE. The Queen has order'd us to meet her here: But, on what subject to confer, we know not. This is a day of wonders and caprice; But you, Alvarez! patient bear each change, With calm indifference, and stoic apathy: Whilst various torments rack my burning soul, And love and pride, by turns, my bosom rule. SCENE THIRD. DONNA ISABELLA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ, DON ALVAREZ. D. ISABELLA. Leave us, Alvarez! I, to these Counts, would speak, On matters of concernment to myself. Your interest shall obtain my best regard, You shall find all the favour you can wish. D. ALVAREZ. When you command, I know but to obey. (Exit D. Alvarez.) SCENE FOURTH. DONNA ISABELLA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ. D. ISABELLA. I will remove all cause of discontent; And, since my choice more honour will confer, I will reclaim my Ring; and chuse myself. But, from my choice, Alvarez I exclude; Yet, the sole cause of this exclusion, Lords! Is, that I know he loves the Queen of Arragon.â In one of you, I view the future King.â D. MANRIQUE (kneeling). O Madam! how your words transport my soul! E'en whilst I tremble between hope and fear. If Lopez win you, I shall be less wretched, Resigning you to such a worthy Lover. Speak, Madam! my impetuous soul, eager With hope, demands to know my bliss or woe. D. ISABELLA. Rise!âEre I speak my choice, fain would I see, Some certain proof, that 't is myself you love; And not the splendour of my sovereign Rank. Counts! I shall think myself most lov'd by him, Who can my sentiments and thoughts adopt; Like whom I like, and, whom I hate, despise. D. LOPEZ. Lest we mistake your will, speak plainly, Madam! D. ISABELLA. If I have liberal been to valiant Carlos, Let me behold in you a like esteem; Honour his virtues, do his merit justice. For ne'er presume, I will a Consort chuse, To have the King, I make, my work destroy; Reclaim my favours, or disgrace my friends. Therefore, let neither hope to share my Throne, Till something worthy, on your parts, confirms What I have done for Carlos: that by such act, I may remain assur'd, the structure which My gratitude has rear'd, shall not be raz'd: For I must know it safe, from storm, or stratagem. D. MANRIQUE. Don Carlos, Madam! is most highly honour'd; His happiness so much employs your thoughts, Ours is to his inthrall'd: yet since to honour him, Is to please you, instruct us how to act.â The Palm of Victory, nor the Trump of Fame, Ne'er gave renown to one more brave than Carlos. He is most worthy your munificence; And well deserves to be, what you have made him. Our gratitude to him indebted stands, And we wish'd largely to acknowledge it. D. LOPEZ. But after you, we can do nothing for him: Carlos is rais'd above our power to favour. What is there in our power, left to propose, That would not be a degradation to him? D. ISABELLA. Gifts, in your power there are, he might accept; Gifts, that would clear your names from black ingratitude, And free my anxious mind from its disquiet; Gifts, which, without disgrace, he might possess. D. LOPEZ. Then name them, Madam! Power, and not will, we lack, To clear us from this charge of black ingratitude. D. ISABELLA. Counts! you have each a Sister. 'T is my will, That He, whom I shall please to chuse for King, When he receives my hand, at the same Altar, Shall, to the Warrior Carlos, give his Sister. (The Counts testify by their looks much surprise.) Embrace him, as his Brother, and his Friend; And thus secure him from my Husband's enmity. Not that I need to fear his hate to Carlos; As in Castile I shall be always Queen. For the new King, whate'er his project be, Will, though inthron'd, be only my first subject. But to exert my plenitude of power, Over the heart to which I gave my own, Would pain my inmost soul in the extreme. I urge this union as of strife preventive, Then answer? Will ye give your full consent? D. MANRIQUE. Yes, Queen! our full consentâto doom us both To the most cruel death, rather than see, The bright, pure honours of a thousand years, By such a marriage, in one moment tarnish'd.â Too dear an Empire at a price like this! D. ISABELLA. Thus then, audacious Count! thus then you testify, That Carlos is most worthy my munificence; And well deserves to be, what I have made him. Thus to except against the Rank I give, Proud Manrique! is to scorn my sovereign power. D. MANRIQUE. I do not, Queen! dispute your power to exalt Carlos, or whom you please, e'en to our Rank. No Sovereign stands accountable for dignities, Which he confers, or gifts his liberality Bestows. If he support, or raise, the unworthy, 'T is his own work, and the shame all his own. But to disgrace, by misalliance, blood, Which, from my Ancestors, unsully'd flows, No Monarch ever shall, by my consent; First be it on a Public Scaffold spilt, Rather than know such vile contamination;â Mine, from inheritance, I owe account of it To my brave Ancestors, and all Posterity: Pure, from my great Forefathers I receiv'd it, Pure, shall it still remain, or cease to flow. D. ISABELLA. Then, Manrique! I, who owe account to no one, Will of your vaunted, noble blood dispose. Be mine the shame of its contamination. What mad extravagance makes you presume To think, I should propose, what would dishonour you? How dare you to suspect me of such turpitude? What law of rectitude, or nicest honour, Have I infring'd, throughout my Life, proud Lord? Or what disgrace incurr'd? I know of none, But what I now incurâbeing forc'd to wed,â Degrading thought,âthe Vassal of my Crown; Who,âwhilst I thus descend,âscorns to intrust His honour to my care.âSay! in what character, Subject, or Lover, dare you to treat me thus? D. LOPEZ. Pardon the ardour, which infatuates him, And makes him disrespectful in his speech: In marriage, both our Sisters are betroth'd. D. ISABELLA. To whom? D. MANRIQUE. His Sister, Madam! is to me affianc'd. D. ISABELLA (to Manrique). To whom is yours engag'd? D. MANRIQUE. To Lopez, Madam! D. ISABELLA. Then I am wrong in making either King. Go, happy Lovers! go to your chosen Mistresses: And to enhance the value of your love, Tell them, with what contemptuous, galling scorn, You have a Queen insulted, and disdain'd A throne.âRetire! We hold no further conference. D. LOPEZ (kneeling). Yet hear us, Madam! D. ISABELLA. And what have you to urge? To speak in praise of constancy in love; And that no earthly grandeur should seduce it? If 't is a crime to violate this virtue, I too, perhaps, my Lords! may learn to practise it. D. LOPEZ. Practise it, Madam!âBut permit us first To explain ourselves; that you may fully know Don Manrique's heart, and mine, where you reign absolute; As Queen respected, and ador'd as Mistress.â Your choice will make the one, on whom it falls, Supremely bless'd, the other doom to woe. But to prevent all jealous feuds between us, A mutual promise binds us in one interest. If he be chosen, then I wed his Sister; If I obtain you, mine with him unites: Thus, Carlos cannot to the King be brother. D. ISABELLA. And know you not, that, being what you are, The feudatory Vassals of my State, Your Sisters are my Subjects, and on me Depend?âWithout my order, and expressly Against my will, in marriage to engage them, Is to usurp my Throne, and give me law. D. MANRIQUE. Assert your high prerogative as Sovereign, Command us, as the Vassals of your State: Do not request, unless we may refuse. Command, we, at our peril, must obey. D. LOPEZ. But, Queen! remember,ânever will consent.â D. MANRIQUE. And yet, in deference to your election, Thus far we will recede, through love and duty; Carlos is generous and he knows his birth; Let him in secret judge upon that knowledge. And, if his blood be worthy of such union, To us let him this marriage then propose; And we the alliance shall an honour deem. He has free choice to wed one of our Sisters; If, after knowing these strict terms, he dare. 'T is at his peril if his birth be mean.â Thus far we stoop to gain our royal Mistress. Modest let Carlos be; or else this marriage, Must in innumerable evils plunge him. D. ISABELLA. Yourself take care, lest him too much disdaining, I teach you what a Queen should do, how reign. Retire, my Lords!âI wish to be alone. SCENE FIFTH. DONNA ISABELLA (alone). Whence this mysterious mutiny in both, When their obedience would a Throne obtain? Does it arise from pride, from envy springs it? Is it malignity, contempt, defiance? Or can it be that noble, generous spirit, Which wrestles with the power its fortune wants, Fearing complacency might falsely seem Like a vile parasite, through interest courteous? Perhaps 't is Heaven's high hand that interferes; Yet wherefore?âMy weak sense searches in vain.â Why wars affection with my fame and glory? If only by these cruel, ceaseless conflicts Of reason, pride, and shame, love is control'd, Grant me the fortune, Heaven! I dare not take: And, since for me thou hast not made a King, To the most worthy of my Subjects give me: Inspire my people! let them name Don Carlos. SCENE SIXTH. DONNA ISABELLA, BLANCHE. D. ISABELLA. I have mispent my time. The haughty Counts, At such a price, refuse the Diadem. BLANCHE. I, Madam! am return'd successless too; For Carlos, on such terms, rejects all fortune. D. ISABELLA. What! Is he bent to render hate for hate, And for contemptâcontempt? BLANCHE. Oh! no, far otherwise. The Sisters of the Counts he much esteems; Thinks them deserving of a Monarch's love. D. ISABELLA. Why does he then reject this high alliance? BLANCHE. Some secret obstacle obstructs your plan: For, though obscure and all confus'd his speech, I could perceive a something, from his words, As if some vow of constancy were made; And his whole soul were wedded to the object. D. ISABELLA. Ah!âdoes he love elsewhere? BLANCHE. I judge so, Madam! D. ISABELLA. Whom does he love? BLANCHE. One of exalted Rank. ISABELLA. Alas!âbut tell me whom? BLANCHE. He loves a Queen. D. ISABELLA. He loves a Queen!âElvira is his choice. He quits Castile, and goes with her to Arragon.â Love, and not Glory, makes him quit my Court. BLANCHE. You should desire his absence, as the means To root this fatal passion from your heart. D. ISABELLA. Have I, to lose him, aggrandiz'd him then? And shall a Queen, in the same cradle nurs'd with me, Rear'd, and protected, by my Royal Parents, Castile her refuge, and her sole defence, Shall she,âungrateful as this traitor Carlos,â Rob me of what I priz'd the most; of Carlos Of ungrateful, artful Carlos rob me?â âI will not take such pains to save his life: No; let the ingrate fight, and let him die. BLANCHE. Why should his love, or his retreat offend you? I know not which he loves, you or Elvira; Nor can I comprehend your wrathful Jealousy. D. ELVIRA. Then thou hast never love's disquiet known. Stormy and fearful does it make my mind, And tempest every feeling of my heart. Elvira has no loftiness, no pride; More generous, more exalted, than myself, She, with the noble spirit of a Queen, Bestows her Crown; she is belov'd, ador'd; Whilst I amâleft, scorn'd, hated, and renounc'd. My pride, that dares not chuse him King, yet, brooks not His desertion. BLANCHE. Since you respect your honour Too much to chuse him King, why wish his heart? D. ISABELLA. I love him.âCan I bear to be disdain'd? No; let him doating to distraction love me: Yet, so respect me, never to break silence. BLANCHE. Respect Your Self.âCombat, conceal, this passion. D. ISABELLA. Carlos contemns me, he can reign without me; He loves Elvira, hence his false respect, That dar'd not love me, but as Heaven is lov'd. She loves him too, and to a Throne will raise him. The Queen, her Mother, is indulgent, Blanche! And her consent will sanctify their union; A Parent's Judgment justifies the Child. Elvira loves him, and will make him King. BLANCHE. Madam! 't is said, she will not now be Queen. For Fame reports that yet her Brother lives. D. ISABELLA. It cannot be; he died in early infancy. BLANCHE. I but declare the rumour, which I heard, That this Prince is not dead, and that he comes Now with th'expected Deputies from Arragon. D. ISABELLA. The Queen of Arragon believes him dead. But in a Son restor'd to prop her state, How will her sorrowing, widow'd heart rejoice; Let mine, though lost to ev'ry hope of bliss, Expand benevolent to greet her joy. (Exit followed by Blanche.) End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act Fourth. SCENE FIRST. DONNA LEONORA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ. D. MANRIQUE. Accept our joint congratulations, Madam! That Heaven restores a Son you mourn'd as dead. For though a Throne and Queen, in beauty's bloom, Were never yielded, but with strong regret; Although, to one of us, they both are promis'd, We, seeing a King competitor, resign them; Before the States revoke their choice of us. The Prince, your Son, back to your arms restor'd, Shall find us faithful Subjects. Till he claims These his high rights, accept for him our homage. D. LOPEZ. We mourn as Lovers, but rejoice as patriots; Our faithful hearts are to the State devoted; Therefore we ardent wish Castile with Arragon, To be united firm by this Alliance: That their leagu'd forces may the Moors subdue. Unblushing we resign this glorious fortune; Which, whilst it honour'd us, our Queen degraded. Let Isabella and Don Sancho reign. D. LEONORA. My Lords! this gen'rous resignation flatters Too soon my new rais'd hopesâAlas! what hopes? My princely Son in infancy expir'd: And this report, excites my grief, and wonder, Opens the sources of my woes afresh, Renews my sorrow for my first-born hope, With all the yearning anguish mothers know, Who mourn an only Son's untimely death. Oh! did he live! now might his arm protect His own, his Sister's and his Mother's cause. D. LOPEZ. Doubtless for this Heaven has preserv'd your Son. D. LEONORA. Alas! my Lord! He has not been preserv'd.â Nineteen long years I o'er his tomb have wept. He cannot be aliveâunless some miracle, From Heaven's high hand, compels the yawning grave To yield its prey.âAll that concerns my Son, I will relate: then judge, if this report Have aught, on which a Mother's hope may build.â I will not trace my troubles to their source: For Arragon's revolt, and Garcia's usurpation, From my long biding here, must be well known. D. MANRIQUE. Oft from our Fathers have we heard your woes; How Ferdinand was from his Kingdom driven; And you, ere eighteen summers' suns had grac'd Your brow, were forc'd to seek for shelter here, Before the fair Elvira saw the light. Thus much we know; in what remains instruct us. D. LEONORA. Just as Don Ferdinand beheld the Rebel Garcia Ready to mount his Throne, my Son was born: Don Sancho was my hapless infant nam'd. From barbarous Garcia's fury to protect him, My royal Husband urg'd me to consent To his conveyance to a safe retreat. The place where Ferdinand conceal'd my Child, I never knew. D. MANRIQUE. Had you no clew to trace him, That so one Day you might reclaim your Son? D. LEONORA. My husband with our Infant tokens sent: Mine and his Portrait, with a braid of hair, Pledge of my love, ere yet my bridal day; And a deed, written by Ferdinand himself, That own'd and that identify'd our Son. These in an iron Casket were inclos'd; Its secret spring known but to him, and me.â Ah! these precautions prov'd but useless care. Twelve Moons had scarcely wan'd when my Child dy'd; Ere I again had clasp'd him to my breast. D. LOPEZ. Perhaps some false report might then deceive you; We came expecting you could solve our doubts, And realize the hope and wish of all, To find your Son in a most valiant hero. Fain would I hope this rumour may prove true; And that your Son still lives to glad your eyes. D. LEONORA. Oh! 't is impossible! His Father, he himself, Told the dire tale. He saw my babe expire,â Catch'd his last breath,âand clos'd his beamless eyes. D. MANRIQUE. Would we could doubt the truth of his report! D. LEONORA. A Year of woe, and bloody contest pass'd, Then Ferdinand rejoin'd his son in death. Within my arms he died. His last words were,â âDon Raymond has in charge, when time shall be, âA most important secret for thy ear; âFly to Castile, live for our unborn Infant.ââ Long did I hope this secret was my Son: But Raymond never gave me hope it was. Raymond is lost, and I shall never know it; Five years are pass'd since he was prisoner made, By Garcia's spies. I fear they murder'd him; Too faithful to my cause, brave Raymond perish'd. SCENE SECOND. DONNA LEONORA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ, DON ALVAREZ. D. LEONORA. Hast thou learn'd, Count! whence this report arises? D. ALVAREZ. Don Raymond lives; by me he greets you, Madam! D. LEONORA. For my true Servant's life, kind Heaven! I thank thee! D. ALVAREZ. More joy awaits you, Queen!â D. LEONORA (with wild ecstasy). Have I, a Son? D. ALVAREZ. Don Sancho lives.â D. LEONORA. Oh, lead me!âlet me see him!â Weep on his neck, and clasp him in my arms!â My Son!!âmy Son!!âYet can it be, Great God! Oh! bring me to him! make me know he lives! (Going.) D. ALVAREZ (staying the Queen). Don Raymond seeks him.â D. LEONORA. Seeks him? Oh! all is falseâ (Leans half-fainting upon D. Manrique.) I hop'd him come with Raymond, this the secret, Which, dying Ferdinand declar'd, he knew. D. ALVAREZ. Madam, it is. And Raymond seeks Don Sancho Here, in this Court. D. LEONORA. Ah! vain research, Alvarez! Will you conduct Don Raymond hither to me. D. ALVAREZ. He to the assembled troops is gone, in hopes To find Don Sancho midst their Captains. Don Raymond join'd the Deputies from Arragon, After their messengers were sent to announce To you their near approach. Then he declar'd That their Prince liv'd; that here, he hop'd to find him, As in the armies of Castile he long has serv'd.â I will seek Raymond, Madam! but so eagerly, Do your brave Arragonians press around him, Their Prince demanding, that I doubt, to bring Him hither, I must bring the whole wild multitude. SCENE THIRD. DONNA LEONORA, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ. D. MANRIQUE. As here Don Raymond seeks him, I believe, Either that Heaven has torn Don Sancho from you, Or that he lives in the Illustrious Carlos. D. LEONORA. Carlos, my Lord?âAnd thinks Don Manrique thus? D. LOPEZ. This is the thought, and wish of a whole People:â When it was known that here your son was sought, All with one voice exclaim'd, âHe must be Carlos!â We judg'd that you could have explain'd the mystery. And therefore sought your presence to explore it. D. MANRIQUE. Madam! though envious of Carlos deem'd, I own that his whole life, since we have known him, Throughout its wondrous course, appears one miracle: Himself and fortune almost supernatural. His high strung virtue that enchants all minds; His lofty valour, which transcends my praise, His port majestic and his winning mien, Give him access, beyond a Subject's reach, To thrones: Two Queens, all emulous, strive, Who shall esteem and honour him the most; Nay, e'en from love, can scarce defend their hearts. The prompt respect of an adoring People, Who, like some god, gaze at him as he passes, All, with resistless evidence, evinces That valiant Carlos is your long-lost Son. D. LEONORA. In such a Son, how might a Mother triumph? But yet beware, my Lords! how you inspire The thought, that Carlos is my long-mourn'd Child; Lest I mistake a woman's conscious pride, That would exult to own a Son like him, For Nature's sacred voice within my breast. He has a Prince's spirit, not his birth; Himself, by his own conduct, this attests, Leaving the Queen to chuse, amongst her Subjects, The Partner of her royal bed and Throne. D. MANRIQUE. See you not, Madam! that his princely spirit Prepares to gain this conquest o'er all three. Have you forgotten what he said before you? âI will owe nought to those who gave me lifeââ Nobly his heart resigns that high advantage, To owe his greatness only to his courage. D. LOPEZ. Behold him! we shall know from him the truth. SCENE FOURTH. DONNA LEONORA, DON CARLOS, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ. (Carlos enters with precipitation. Donna Leonora flies to him with open arms; Carlos retreats.) D. LEONORA. Am I so bless'd to have a Son like Thee? A mother's happiness,âa widow's joy, Hangs on thy answer;âCarlos! art thou my Son?â Speak, ere a Mother's exstasy of hope O'ercomes my soul, and my arms clasp thy neck. If thou be alien to my blood, O speak! But let my long-lost Son come to my arms. D. CARLOS. O Queen! I grieve to find this errour spread; Reserve these transports for your happy Son; I am not he.âI sought you to complain; And beg release from an offensive honour.â The People obstinately bent to take Away my name, declare I am Don Sancho, And Prince of Arragon. His presence soon Will prove how much mistaking they have been, In thinking me that Prince. I am rais'd up The phantom of an hour. Such cruel mockery Abases you, O Queen! as well as Carlos. D. LEONORA. Oft is the People's voice the voice of Heaven: Impulsively at once it bursts inspir'd. D. LOPEZ. My Lord! we know, from well-confirm'd report, That, in the armies of Castile, Don Sancho serves, Unknown 't is true, save to himself alone. Therefore all eyes are fix'd on you, as one, Whose dazzling merit, speaks exalted Rank. No longer, Prince! deny what Heaven proclaims. You have obliged us to transgress against you, When you should not have forc'd our disrespect. Our high esteem for Carlos was well known; Our pride warr'd not with him, but with his birth. Though Carlos we disdain'd, yet we respect Don Sancho, will accept him for our Monarch, When to our Queen he deigns to own himself. Quit your disguise, my Lord! and as Don Sancho, And our chosen King, receive our loyal homage. (They take off their hats, and with their right hands upon their hearts, they bow.) D. CARLOS. This false respect, with which you have surpris'd me, Is more injurious, Counts! than your contempt. I thought this strange report the work of chance; Not doubting any bold enough to dare, To make a pageant King of me for sport. Is this the jest of your exuberant spirits? Then learn, gay Lords! that the brave honour valour; And that your equals, in the field, respect, Nor make of mine a mockery, a may-game. If this be your intent, first vanquish, then Deride me; victorious, you may railly me With grace: Now you anticipate your privilege. The Queen's Ring still I guard; and this derided Carlos, his family, and race unknown, The sceptre of Castile from you withholds. This arm which from captivity redeem'd you, May still control, and humble your ambition. D. MANRIQUE. Your speech is that of Monarch, not of Carlos. Your mien assumes the prince, though you deny it: We still defend the honour of our rank; Though prompt to pay what we hop'd due to yours. Madam! we leave to you to explain this mystery, A secret charm for Carlos pleads most strongly; But you can best develop Nature's voice. We go; lest, by his pride, Carlos should force us To lay aside that high respect we owe you. SCENE FIFTH. DONNA LEONORA, CARLOS. D. CARLOS. Madam! you see with what contempt they treat me. D. LEONORA. Leave this dispute; and speak we of Don Sancho. These Lords, though proud, yet generously declare, That in this Court, no Stranger, but yourself, Has, of a Prince disguis'd, the port and virtues; That, if Don Sancho live, he lives in you. Say, are you well acquainted with your birth? D. CARLOS. Alas! I am.âWere I some Infant, winds And waves had spar'd, some little wretch forlorn, By parents in a desert left,âto milder beasts Expos'd,âthrough hatred, fear, or cruel shame; By hazard found, and from kind pity nurtur'd; My pride, at this report, would rise to hope, Beholding you, thus doubtful, thus distress'd. For I am high of heart and most ambitious. Sceptres and diadems transport my soul; And my presumptuous mind impetuous soars Beyond all bounds, in useless, idle flights. Whilst a few warlike deeds sustain vain thoughts;â Sudden my eyes cast inward, they are dash'd From godlike heights to deep humiliation.â âI know my Parents.âI am not Don Sancho.â He with your Deputies perhaps is come; And a few hours will bring him to your arms. D. LEONORA. The Counts have lighted in my mind a hope, I fain would cherish.âAlways I esteem'd you; A secret movement, in despite of me, Inclin'd me ever to admire, nay love you. And something now, intuitively strong, Within my breast, disowns your words; and says, You are deceiving me, or else deceiv'd. What animates me thus I cannot tell; Whether the ardour of a Mother's love, Or admiration for transcendent merit; Whether the sacred voice of Nature speaks, Or my esteem pays tribute to your worth; Whether my heart, drawn by mysterious instinct, Thus owns its blood, or my soul makes a choice. D. CARLOS. Such thoughts as these deceive their followers, As the night-meteor travellers misleads; They are delusions all. Then, Queen! resist them. If the least gleam of dawning hope could rise Within my breast, that I your Son could be, Think with what towering joy, what exultation, I, at your feet, should fall, and claim your love. The lofty pride of my aspiring mind, Would glory to be Master of a Throne; But, with a dearer triumph would rejoice In such a Mother; whose exalted rank, Is less conspicuous than her long-try'd virtues. Again,âwith solemn truth,âI re-assure youâ I know my Parents:âI am not Don Sancho. D. LEONORA. With pain my heart relinquishes the thought.â O God of Heaven! hadst thou for me preserv'd A Son like this, how would my widow'd heart Exult with joy, and praise thy wondrous mercy! How should I glory if thou wert my Son! D. CARLOS. Would that I were! but I am not so bless'd.â D. LEONORA. Since you deny it, you are not my Son: No longer hide your Birth; reveal this mystery. However high your thoughts may have aspir'd, Carlos! my condemnation fear not. So great is my esteem, that in your favour, My prosperous fortune, and my regal power, I will exert to honour and distinguish you, E'en to the height of most ambitious thoughts. I think your virtues worthy of a Throne: If noble blood flow in your veins, Don Carlos! A fate awaits you will reward your merits. D. CARLOS. The secret of myselfâmust rest with me: Never, to mortal ear, to be reveal'd. D. LEONORA. If, with this secret, you will not intrust me, At least, refuse me not another boon; Which, as a Mother, earnestly I crave. D. CARLOS. Name it. For you, Elvira, and the Queen, I live, and, in the cause of each, had I Ten thousand lives, I would expend them all. D. LEONORA. The boon I ask, is, to withdraw your services. We now can reign without your succour, Carlos! The death of Garcia has repair'd his crimes; And renders Arragon back to its Sovereign. A child of mine, in peace, now mounts its Throne: Don Sancho if he live; or else my Daughter. No longer then prepare to follow us; Constrain us not that honour to accept. With candour, Carlos! does a Mother own, That, with such dazzling virtues, much she fears you. To judgment such as yours this may suffice. D. CARLOS. Why must I thus be treated in extremes? Lov'd as a Son, or hated as a foe? In what do I offend? Whence your disdain? Why, of the only joy I had, bereave me? D. LEONORA. Brave youth! I see with grief the pain you feel. Your birth conceal'd, commands this conduct from me: In me 't is prudent, and to you most friendly. I but prevent the wretchedness of all; Forbidding hopes, which never must be answer'd. I am constrain'd your service to relinquish. D. CARLOS. I thought my griefs had reach'd their worst extreme: But this rejection of my humble aid, Wounds with a pang, I never thought to feel. The last, bright ray, that cheer'd my lonely mind, It is your pleasure to obscure for ever;â The Sun will never rise for me again. D. LEONORA. Farewell! grateful I thank the zeal you shew'd To serve our cause. I hold you, generous Carlos! In high esteem:ârespect youâbeyond words. Accept a friend's best wishes, who regrets you: May ev'ry blessing Heaven reserves for virtue, Your portion be; may peace, content, and honour, Make your life happy, and long flourish round you. When next your happy Mother's arms shall clasp you, Tell her, she has more joy, than Thrones can give, A joy, I would were mine, a Son like you.â âSpeak not!âThis moment rends my heartâmay Heaven!â (The Queen retires with precipitation much agitated.) SCENE SIXTH. DON CARLOS, BLANCHE. BLANCHE. What can thus agitate the Queen, my Lord! D. CARLOS. Her just rejection and disdain of me. BLANCHE. Disdain a hero! who is own'd for King. D. CARLOS. Fair Lady! aid not envy thus to mock me; I have no claim to such a glorious title. BLANCHE. The Queen herself believes you Prince of Arragon. To her your silence has been most ungrateful; Her generosity to valiant Carlos, Deserv'd the instant thanks e'en of Don Sancho. I came to summon your attendance on her. And see, she comes to give you audience here. (Exit Blanche.) SCENE SEVENTH. DONNA ISABELLA, DON CARLOS. D. ISABELLA. Why has Don Sancho thus conceal'd himself? I dare not offer gratulations to him, Those he despises, since he would not claim them, Rejecting his advantages as King. D. CARLOS. I have no claim to gratulations, Madam! You are deceiv'd in thinking me Don Sancho.â Permit me instantly to quit Castile, And shun the gathering storm, that threats my head. D. ISABELLA. What can you fear? What thus appals you, Marquis? Because a Monarch deem'd are you offended, When your own virtues force us to presume it? If not Don Sancho, tell me who you are? Though you disdain'd, when brav'd, to name your race, Yet, I entreat you, now confide in me. D. CARLOS. Already is my secret half betray'd; In vain I hid my country and my race, In vain assum'd another name, disdainful, Hating the one fate gave me at my birth. My Name and Country are discovered both; I am of Arragon,âthere Sancho nam'd.â Thus much this fatal errour has unravell'd, I fear Fate's malice will disclose the rest; And soon reveal with shame, and dire disgrace, What Count, what Marquis, you have deign'd to make. D. ISABELLA. Have I nor power, nor courage to protect The structure I have rear'd? Who shall destroy it? Then trust me, Carlos! trust me with this secret, As to a chosen and most zealous friend; And I who wrought your fortune will maintain it. D. CARLOS. Let me depart, ere I a victim fall To the dire fate, that menaces me here; And screen myself from what its wrath prepares. D. ISABELLA. Count, you deceive me! this weak, idle fear, Is love's pretence to quit my Court and Kingdom. Hence your disdain of the fair Bride I offer'd you. Go into Arragon. Your Princess follow;â Go openly! nor thus descend to counterfeit. Since your proud heart is by her charms enslav'd, Do not abase yourself to ask my leave; Depart triumphant, in despite of me. To go, without my knowledge, is less insult, Than to depart against my prohibition. D. CARLOS. In mercy, Madam! add not to my woes, Your cruel scorn, and undeserv'd reproach. D. ISABELLA. Why then delude me with evasive art, Act from one motive, and another own? For such deceit is most ungrateful, Carlos! You love Elvira,âtherefore quit my Court. D. CARLOS. No, Madam, no! I love not bright Elvira: Though I would fight her cause, and die to serve her. Death is my only wish, 't is the sole good, Heaven has in store for meâ D. ISABELLA. Whence this despair? Art thou not grac'd by fortune's richest gifts? And has not Nature, with a lavish hand, Endow'd thee amply, with her choicest blessings? Who is more envy'd, Carlos! than thyself? Then why repine, and whence this strange despondency? Is it within the compass of my power To cure thy griefs?âSpeak! for I wish thee happy. D. CARLOS. Canst thou reverse the stern decrees of Heaven; And by a miracle change nature's course?â Annul the past, from memory's fix'd record; And change the future destiny of things? D. ISABELLA. I understand a sorrow in your words, But not their purport, Carlos! What afflicts you? D. CARLOS. A cureless grief which I must never speak. Which, till it almost bursts, my heart has borne. For pity's sake, O Queen! no more reproach me; But grant me leave, to spend in solitude, My rest of days.âI must notâcannot stay.â D. ISABELLA. Though to a friend's entreaties you are silent; Yet surely to a Queen some reason 's due, For quitting thus, her service and her Court. How can you justify this sudden conduct, So strange, and so unlike the intrepid Carlos? D. CARLOS (wildly). Adoring you, I cease to be myself. No more I wish for fame, nor value life.â Oh! must I see you in another's arms? My mind is fir'd to phrenzy at the thought: Love, envy, and despair, uproot my soul.â I thought to hide this secret in the grave; I sought to die, without offending you. But love, this day, dethrones my feeble reason.â(Kneels.) Can you forgive a wretch, who, on the rack, Has fail'd in firmness, and breath'd forth one sigh, Which, though repented, cannot be recall'd. For you my heart felt the first pulse of love. A heaven inspir'd emotion, undebas'd By self regard, or thought of due return: Hopeless I sigh'd, nor one fond wish dar'd form.â I go for everâmust I go unpardon'd?â (The Queen turns weeping to him.) Madam! you weep! Oh! whence proceed those tears? D. ISABELLA. Carlos!â(stops, unable to speak.) D. CARLOS. O Isabella!âO my royal mistress! What have I done? Have I fresh cause for anguish? Those tears!âburst they from aught but indignation? Scorn were less poignant to my tortur'd mind, Than to have griev'd your heart, or caus'd one tear. And can I ask?âYes:âpity me and frown! Your anger, that will lacerate my heart, Will glad my soul, when reason reigns again. D. ISABELLA. 'Gainst one, who so unwillingly offends, I feel no anger.âCarlos! you are pardon'd. (Signs to him to rise.) D. CARLOS. That pardon is more dear, than all your gifts. Madam! receive your Ring; revoke your trust. I must depart, and hide my guilty head.â D. ISABELLA (irresolute, after a pause). Stay till the Prince of Arragon appears: Give him my Ring. A Queen, for all the favours She has bestow'd, entreats that one from you. D. CARLOS. O Madam! let me shun impending fate. If I obey you, I incur its wrath.â The haughty Counts seek to dishonour me; I would preserve my honour to my grave; Let my heart burst with grief, but not with shame. D. ISABELLA. Stay till Don Sancho comes, ere you depart. Let me in this command;âoblige me, Carlos! D. CARLOS. Oh! fatal mandate! but your will is law. You doom me, Queen! to what is worse than death; To contumelious scorn from those who hate me. Yet,âif you wish it,âwhy should I repine.â I'll stay, and brave the malice of my fate: When you command, I have no self-regard. D. ISABELLA. Why art thou not Don Sancho! hapless Carlos! O Heaven!âbelieve me notâwhat have I said? (Going.) D. CARLOS. What, with strange magic, tortures and delights, Consoles me, whilst it wounds my aching sense, What, has charm'd all the horrours of my fate; What, I most joy to hear, yet grieve to know. (Exeunt severally.) End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act Fifth. SCENE FIRST. DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA. D. ELVIRA. Has aught appear'd to justify the rumour, That Heaven, in Carlos, sends you back a Son? D. LEONORA. The haughty Counts, and the whole Court agree, That Carlos is Don Sancho, and my Son.â D. ELVIRA. He is my brother then?â D. LEONORA. No, my Elvira! Carlos that name disowns. I have just seen him, And 't was an interview that pain'd my soul. SCENE SECOND. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA. D. ISABELLA. Let me not interrupt, but share your converse If it regard your Son; what have you learn'd? D. LEONORA. No more enlighten'd are we than yourself; But wait, with doubtful wonder and impatience, To have this fateful mystery unravell'd. D. ISABELLA. But from whom comes the news of Garcia's death, And this report, so widely spread, so eagerly Receiv'd, that your Son lives? The different couriers, Who for this month arrive, come but with Treaties, From Arragon revolted in your favour; Its Deputies by your appointment come, This Day, to swear Allegiance to their Queen: But of Don Sancho's life, or Garcia's death, Why has the information been delay'd? D. LEONORA. Nor my Son's life, nor Garcia's death, were known, Till Raymond join'd, last night, the Deputies. When first from Saragossa they departed; Our party were besieging, in their last fortress, The traitor Garcia, and his rebel Son; They being slain, the garrison surrender'd: And Raymond, who was prisoner there, set free. He instantly proclaim'd that their Prince liv'd; And he set out, with speed, to seek Don Sancho; Thinking, with him, to o'ertake the Deputies, Who, of his Life, or Garcia's death, were ignorant. Last night he join'd them, after their Messengers To me had been dispatch'd: and he inform'd them, That their young Prince resides, here, in your Court. All anxious as I am, no more I know. I have not yet seen Raymond, so intent Is he in searching for my Son throughout Your hosts. But here, each moment, I expect him. D. ISABELLA (going). I hope he comes to bring you certain tidings.â Fearing to interrupt, I leave you, Madam! D. LEONORA. Remain! For this report concerns us equally. If my Son live, a Monarch claims your hand; And heaven rewards you for your Fathers virtues. That Crown he strove to gain for my Elvira, Shall by his Child be worn. Thus, whilst he toil'd For others good, he aggrandiz'd his Race. D. ELVIRA. My Friend! henceforth my Sister, and my Queen, Heaven has decreed my Diadem to you: Reign with my Brother! and be happy long. SCENE THIRD. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE. D. LEONORA. What news brings Blanche, with that astonish'd look? Is my Son found? BLANCHE. No, Madam! no!â D. ISABELLA. What agitates thee thus? BLANCHE. O cruel fate!âOh! Why did Carlos stay? D. ISABELLA. Speak! What of Him? BLANCHE. Dishonour'd! and undone! D. ELVIRA. Dishonour'd, Blanche!âCarlos dishonour'd?â It cannot be! BLANCHE. His Father is arriv'dâ A peasant Shepherd is the Sire of Carlos. D. ISABELLA. Who told thee this? BLANCHE. I saw their meeting, Madam! And all the court is witness to the fact. D. ISABELLA. I scarcely know to credit thy report. D. ELVIRA. Ah! fortune, how unjust! D. ISABELLA. Unjust indeed! Is this great soul and virtue so sublime, Sprung from a beggar's race?âWhat then is blood? If Carlos, He, whose high, heroic worth Deserves the Throne, his prowess oft has guarded, Was in a cottage born, from shepherd parents? Has Manrique's blood, or my own royal stream, E'er form'd a hero that transcends this Carlos? And, though he sprung in an ungenial soil, His vigorous soul throve midst its scanty nurture, And pair'd with princes nurs'd by fortune's hand. D. ELVIRA. And must this true-born Eagle be disdain'd, Because his aÃ«rie was not plac'd on high? Men should take rank, not from their birth, but virtue. D. ISABELLA. But how did Carlos bear this sad reverse? BLANCHE. Oh! with deep anguish, and exalted courage. Along the audience-hall he graceful walk'd, And, ever and anon, with courteous speech, Check'd the false rumour, as he pass'd the crowd: But all your court was bent to change his name; And murmur'd round, âDon Sancho, Prince of Arragon.â When a poor, mean, old, man, in shepherd's garb, Burst through your guards, and clasp'd him in his arms. âWhy didst thou leave me in my age?â he cried. Carlos turn'd pale; then blush'd from pride and shame. But duty triumph'd, and the hero wept; He clasp'd his aged Parent to his breast; And âO my Father!â âO my long-lost Son!â Echo'd responsive, midst their sighs and tears. D. ISABELLA. Disdainful of his birth, he loves his Sire; Nature and Virtue, rule his noble soul. BLANCHE. Though strange to tell, these cries of grief and joy Were disbeliev'd. The court around them gather'd, And this poor, peasant Shepherd, spite of Carlos, Is deem'd dishonest, torn from his arms, And roughly treated. 'T is a cheat they cry, A dark impostor, by the Counts suborn'd, To throw disgrace on Carlos, and excuse Their proud refusal of the proffer'd combat. D. ELVIRA. 'T is surely so! D. ISABELLA. We must examine this; And, if the Counts be guilty, they shall find, Such malice sins beyond a Prince's mercy. BLANCHE. The Counts themselves deserve your admiration; With pains this incredulity they strengthen, And generously attest the whole a cheat. Not, Madam! that they take this mean, low malice Upon themselves; but they declare, that one Of their domestics is the guilty author; Who, hoping thus to please them, has instructed This poor, mean wretch, how to affront brave Carlos. Each, with avidity, believes this tale; The Counts, to gain more credence to their story, Have caus'd this aged man to be imprison'd. D. ISABELLA. What must we think of this? BLANCHE. In vain does Carlos Witness against himself; no one believes him, He storms, he menaces, he raves, and, wild With anger, loudly claims his Father's liberty. All tremble at his wrath, yet disbelieve it; And think he cannot be a Shepherd's Son. But, see! he comes to make complaint to you. SCENE FOURTH. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE, DON CARLOS, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ. D. CARLOS. Behold the fruit of my obedience, Madam! The fatal secret of my birth is known; Your will expos'd me to this dire mischance. My aged Father from my arms is torn, Falsely accus'd, unjustly led to prison. D. MANRIQUE. Carlos! this Shepherd's claim disgraces you. We think him one suborn'd to stain your honour; He is to prison led for this injustice. D. CARLOS. I am this Shepherd's Son. He is no cheat, No infamous impostor; though mean of blood, He is not vile of soul. And I renounce More willingly, the names of Count and Marquis, Than a Son's sentiments of love and duty. Nought can efface the sacred character Of Nature's ties, within an honest breast. I left my parents, I disclaim'd my name: My soul for honour sigh'd, for glory panted, E'en in that cottage where my fate had cast me. Your courtly maxims warr'd against my hopes; The road of Honour, and the course of Glory, Were open but to Lords. I had no means To rise, but to conceal my birth. I learn'd To blush at what, in other courts, would be My praise,âThat in five years a peasant youth Rose from the Ranks, distinguished by his Sword, To be, though so contemn'd, what now I am. (To the Queen.) Madam! command that they should free my Father. I claim your justice, though I stand degraded. That I am known, I think disgrace enough, To satisfy the hate of my proud scorners; Let them not vilify my honest Parent. D. MANRIQUE (to the Queen). Force this great heart still to preserve his glory; Prevent him from attesting his own tale. We cannot bear that this exalted Carlos, Beneath whose arm the Moors so oft have trembled, To whom this Kingdom so indebted stands, Should, from his birth, receive a stain indelible. A higher rank his godlike valour merits, Than custom gives to such ignoble blood. I now must own such custom is unwise, Alike impolitic, unjust, and cruel. The man, whose deeds merit a princely rank, Though in a cottage born, that rank should grace. D. LOPEZ. Most true.âBut as that custom is inveterate, We must our conduct shape to the now exigence. In our deceit deign, gracious Queen! to aid us. The people love their errour, they all think This peasant Shepherd a suborn'd impostor. This errour authorize, in spite of Carlos. In justice to his great exploits, defend His Honour, and preserve his Rank and Glory. Alvarez strives this Father to persuade To shew his love, by now disowning Carlos; Sustain this artifice our pity rais'd. D. CARLOS. How am I fallen! If I excite your pity!â Retain your scorn, resume your enmity! Now my ill fate your envy gratifies, It soothes your pride to pity my disgrace. But ostentatious shew is this your virtue, Which may some ambush haply plan for mine. The glory Heaven has will'd that I should reap, Has made my name deserving of remembrance. My Honours, Count! would be too dearly purchas'd, If, by an act of baseness, I retain'd them. Though I conceal'd my birth, because 'twas mean, Yet know, proud Lords! I'll not disown my Father; Nor criminate him, e'en to guard my rank, And shield my pride, from your contemptuous scorn. D. MANRIQUE. Noblest of minds!âYield to those rigid maxims, Which custom has establish'd firm as laws: Preserve your honour, and disown your birth. D. CARLOS. Since known to you, I care not, Lords! who knows it. Who tells the meanness of my birth, must tell, That Sancho, a poor, honest peasant's Son, From bondage sav'd two Counts: and lately held In tribulation two illustrious rivals On their Queen's choice. Sancho, a peasant's Son, Holds in his hand the power to seat a Sovereign Upon that Throne, his arm has propp'd, his sword Has twice redeem'd.âSpite of himself, this Sancho, Though but a shepherd's Son, was thought a Prince. Hence learn what mind and courage can achieve, And contemplate the building they have rear'd.â That want of birth must raze this goodly fabric, Is an unwholesome maxim in the state, Which saps its vigour, and enslaves its people. Virtue or in the Peasant or the Prince, Should meet the same impartial, just reward. Yet, notwithstanding this unjust disgrace, All noble minds will value me the more, When they reflect, how much from nothing, (after High Heaven's example) my bold heart has made. D. LOPEZ. This generous pride proclaims a nobler birth; It testifies against your own report; And wraps again, in mystery's dark veil, What we thought fully clear'd. No, valiant Carlos! A shepherd's son such sentiments ne'er spoke. Your haughty soul is so sublimely form'd, That I believe the errour we have spread, Rather than your account. And, I maintain, That you are not the Son of shepherd Nuna. D. CARLOS. All-powerful instinct witnesses I am: Else would my filial love curb pride, and shame. Which like a whirlwind rage within my soul. D. MANRIQUE. Thou dost mistake thy nobleness of spirit, Which scorns the vice of a mean, low-soul'd pride, For force of blood. This fancy'd instinct, Carlos! By thy own self, is all fallacious prov'd. Thou stand'st internal evidence against it. (To the Queen.) Repent not, Madam! of those dignities With which you have rewarded his rare merits; No Monarch could more justly favours place; Virtues like his adorn and heighten honours, And will support them with becoming soul; Superiour e'en to fate, which bows before them. D. ISABELLA. I know not which, my Lords! I most admire, His noble nature or your generous minds, Thus rendering honour to illustrious worth. (To Carlos.) And you, miraculous Hero! whose great soul Disdains to take advantage of the errour Of a whole people, who themselves deceive; Say! if amidst the griefs, which you experience, I can in aught console your mind, or mitigate That destiny, your spirit nobly braves? I, in detaining, have disgrace brought on you;â Through my whole life, I shall regret your fate; And wish your birth had equall'd your high merit, That I no bounds might set to its reward. D. CARLOS. I bow resign'd to what just Heaven ordains; But consolation I can never know;â Yet, it relieves my fate, that you lament it.â D. ISABELLA. So lowly born, I think you most unfortunate; Yet, in the most supreme degree, I hold you Estimable, that being from such Parents sprung, Unblushing, and undaunted, thus you own them. Astonish'd, I your heart and mind revere; Which, in the balance plac'd against your birth, Have far uprais'd your lowly cottage blood; Which mounts ennobled by high Heaven's award. Kings, who give titles, cannot merit give; Virtue's a gem their power cannot create; They can but set, and bid its splendour blaze, When plac'd on high, with more conspicuous lustre: Ungrac'd it still retains its native worth, On earth neglected, it has Rank in Heaven, Angels proclaiming there its just reward.â Aid us, O Carlos! to preserve your Honours; Concede to custom's strict, establish'd laws: Do not proclaim your birth. Preserve my favours. D. CARLOS. I thank you, Madam!âbutâI must forego them.â (D. Carlos takes his sword from his belt, and, kneeling, presents it to the Queen.) This from your Royal Brother I receiv'd,â I now resign it for some worthier hand.â D. ISABELLA. Oh! pain me not to this extreme degreeâ Carlos!!âretain your sword!âfor my sake use itâ D. CARLOS (rising, and half-drawing the sword). With transport, Madam!âfor your sake I'll use it. (Going.) D. ISABELLA. Stay, Carlos! stayâI understand your purpose;â 'Tis self-destructionâ D. ELVIRA. O Carlos! let me plead!â D. LEONORA. Why art thou not my Son! For pity's sake!â D. CARLOS (with assumed composure). What cause for this alarm?âthese trembling fears? Madam! I must retire,âI, to your goodness, My Father's safety earnestly commend. D. MANRIQUE. On one condition only, grant it, Queen! (To Carlos.) Swear no attempt to make against your life. D. ISABELLA. I value much thy life.âOh! be entreated! Summon thy Virtue, and control despair; Above all praise remain a bright example, Subdue thyself, and be the first of Heroes. Carlos! I pray thee,âgive me thy word to live!â(After a pause.) Plant not eternal thorns within that heart, Which loves thy virtues, and esteems thy valour; Add to the Hero's fame the Saint's submission; And patient bear the present torturing hour. Thy death would darkly cloud my future days; And ev'ry hour embitter with regret. O, hapless Carlos! promise me to live!â D. CARLOS. Till my heart breaksâHere let the cordage crack!â SCENE FIFTH. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE, DON CARLOS, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ, DON ALVAREZ. D. ISABELLA (to Alvarez). Say, what success?âHast thou obtain'd thy suit? And will this Peasant quit his claim to Carlos? D. ALVAREZ. Nor prayers, nor bribe can win this wretched Shepherd, To aid in our design. I strove in vain, By every argument, to make him feel How irksome his ungracious presence was. That he disgrac'd a generous, valiant Son, Ruin'd his fortune, stigmatiz'd his honour: That if he lov'd him, he must now declare, 'T was a mean trick he had been brib'd to play him. To all the reasons I could urge, I added menacesâ D. CARLOS. My Father's virtue has withstood them all?â D. ALVAREZ. Unshaken, unseduc'dâHe claims his Sonâ And for his loss of fortune, or of honour, He says that he can make him a great Lord. Simple and credulous he this believes; Because his wife a hundred times has told him, That at the sight of a poor paltry token, The Queen of Arragon will Carlos aggrandize. I, won by the old man's tears, and earnest prayers, Present this homely pledge, this Iron Casket. (Don Alvarez presents an Iron Casket to Donna Leonora; who starts at the sight of it, and leans for support upon her Daughter.) D. ISABELLA. What trouble, at this sight, shakes your whole frame? D. LEONORA. Well may my soul be shaken to behold it. That Casket, Queen! is mine: and it contains The marks by which I am to know my Son, E'en by the King his Father testified. Whether he lives, or not, this may declare. Enter Guard. GUARD (to Donna Leonora). Madam! Don Raymond begs an audience of you. D. LEONORA. Swift let him come. (Exit Guard.) (To Isabella.) Forgive my impatient ardour. Raymond alone can clear this mystery. SCENE SIXTH. DONNA ISABELLA, DONNA LEONORA, DONNA ELVIRA, BLANCHE, DON CARLOS, DON MANRIQUE, DON LOPEZ, DON ALVAREZ, DON RAYMOND. D. LEONORA. Oh! welcome, Raymond! Hast thou found my Son? D. RAYMOND. I hope he lives; yet, where he is I know not. For from five years of bondage just releas'd, I've vainly sought him, where, by the late King's order, I with such happy secrecy had plac'd him. His foster Father thought him his own Son; For, being absent when a dead child was born, Your living Son was by his wife receiv'd; And with kind care was nurtur'd as her own. A Priest, by me intrusted, form'd his mind, As 't were through friendly charity and love: And from this pious Pastor have I learn'd That your Son fled, at Sixteen years of age, As he imagin'd, bent to follow arms, From which no prayers could win his princely soul. D. LEONORA. But whither went he, Raymond! Can they tell? D. RAYMOND. Large sums of gold were oft mysteriously From him receiv'd; but no trace given to find him. Anxious, uncertain of his fate, five years Did his false parents mourn. When by a neighbour, Just from Castile return'd, they were inform'd, That he had seen their son, but in such glory, And credit, at this Court, that his heart fail'd him, He neither dar'd accost him, nor declare, That he had known him once a cottage resident. The Sire, with joy transported, at such news, Set out to seek this boasted Son, two days Before I reach'd his dwelling, where I thought To find Don Sancho safe. Hither I bent My course, o'ertook the Deputies from Arragon, And told all this to them. In vain I seek To trace this Peasant, or to find your Son. D. LEONORA. Look round this presence, if amongst these Lordsâ D. RAYMOND (at the feet of Carlos). My royal Master! hail! D. LEONORA. My Son! My Son! (She makes an effort to go to Carlos, but sinks greatly agitated upon Blanche.) D. LOPEZ. Hail, King of Arragon!âPrince! we exult With heart-felt zeal, and homage pay your virtues. D. CARLOS. Still do I fear some strange reverse of fortune. But let us see, if the King's testimony Agree with what Don Raymond has declar'd; I dare not think such happiness awaits me. D. LEONORA (recovering and turning to Carlos). Are you alone incredulous? Ope we This Casket. Manrique and Lopez both well know What it contains. (Lopez presents and holds the Casket: its contents seen, the Queen, Leonora, takes out a writing.) D. LEONORA. Raymond! whose writing's this? D. RAYMOND. Don Sancho's Father's; Royal Ferdinand's. D. LEONORA. Don Manrique! read, and force him to believe. D. MANRIQUE (reads). To Leonora, Queen of Arragon and Wife of Ferdinand. âFearing to trust maternal tenderness, âWhich takes not wisdom's counsel for its guide, âYou are deceiv'd by a fictitious tale, âThe more securely to deceive the tyrant. âThat Son, whose death you now in anguish mourn, âI hope will to your bosom be restor'd, âAnd your now grief be chang'd to rapturous joy. âThe wife of Shepherd Nuna tends your child; âShe has adopted him, his birth unknown, âAnd, with a Mother's tender care, will foster him. âShe has been told a dark, mysterious tale; âAnd, on her secrecy, promis'd reward: âIf, when the Child has number'd twenty years. âShe, with this Iron Casket, send him forth âTo seek for Leonora Queen of Arragon, âWho knows the sacred treasure it contains, âAnd can alone unlock the secret spring; âAnd who will make this, her adopted Child, âA powerful Lord, who kindly will maintain her âIn peace and plenty in her hoary age: âIf, faithfully from him, and all the world, âShe keep the secret till the appointed time. âDeign, Leonora! when this meets your eye, âHowe'er high Heaven has of my fate dispos'd, âTo own in Nuna's Son, who this presents, âYour Son and mine, my rightful lineal Heir. âHail him as lawful King of Arragon, âAnd may he worthy prove to wear my crown, âOr never mount his wretched Father's Throne. âFerdinand, King of Arragon.â D. LEONORA (to Carlos, who kneels to her). Thy mind, thy courage, all attest my Son. O! teach me to deserve this blessing, Heaven! This more than all a Mother's hopes could ask, This ecstasy of joy, too great for wordsâ O! bless my Son, and guard his virtues still. (She raises Carlos.) D. CARLOS. No longer can I doubt my birthâMy Sister (Embraces D. Elvira.) (To D. Isabella.) Thus grac'd, and thus distinguish'd, still I sigh, As incomplete my bliss, if you forbid My hopes. D. ISABELLA. He is to hope superiour, Prince! Who can command his wish. The power to name A Monarch for Castile, I with my Ring Bestow'd. I begg'd you to remain, to give That pledge into Don Sancho's hand; too much I him esteem, e'er to revoke that prayer. D. CARLOS. I thank you, Madam! with a grateful heart. I feel the bliss of this ecstatic moment; My heart pent up, and bursting through despair, Heaven has reliev'd by an unheard-of grace. No more I wonder at my high ambition, My Queen, and Sister shar'd my hopeless heart; The voice of love, and nature undistinguish'd. D. ELVIRA. My Heart, respecting still my rank, repaid That love, which kindred blood inspires and owes, D. CARLOS. If as a Brother then you love and honour me, You will accept a husband from my hand. D. ELVIRA. If on Alvarez, Prince! your choice is fix'd, To all men I preferr'd him, save yourself. D. CARLOS (to D. Leonora). This fair alliance has your sanction, Madam? (D. Leonora bows assent.) (To Alvarez, presenting D. Elvira.) Accept the brightest gem I can bestow, My darling Sister for your bride, Alvarez! (To Manrique and Lopez.) And you, my Lords! though you disdain'd my birth, Yet when these doubts arose, judged in my favour, With such generous warmth; by that have shown, That your disdain from honour sprang, not pride; Your maxims wrong, but virtuous your intent. Accept my friendship, and receive my thanks. D. RAYMOND (to Isabella). Permit the Arragonians to behold him. Our Deputies impatient wait for Audience; And burn with eagerness to see their King. D. ISABELLA (to Leonora). Let us in public give them audience, Madam! That All may hear this miracle explain'd. But let the honest Shepherd share the joy, His coming with that Casket makes complete. (To D. Carlos and D. Leonora.) The trials of your hearts now end in transport. That virtue, which our Duties all enjoin, Though strongly tried, still meets its sure reward; A peaceful Conscience, and approving Heaven. Firm midst the Storm, the good Man steers his way; Whilst frustrate lightnings innocently play; He views their baffled rage with generous scorn; Or gild his triumph, or his fall adorn.
