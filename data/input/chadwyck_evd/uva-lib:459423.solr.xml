So! the world is calm, now busie Action Her Theater hath left, wrapt in the vaile Of night, whose silent Issue hath, e're this, The stupid Soul beguil'd with empty Hope, While I do mine confirm, enlightned with The watchfull flames of Love and Sov'ranty: Whose active tempers strugling to engross Seems troubled in his mind. My yeelding fancy soly to each other, Frustrate, in their division, the design My suspend Resolution should put on To form and finish both their purposes. Pauses. Y'unruly Fires! who frame and guide the world! Why thus disagree your transferr'd beams in Fraile humanity? If for the order, Of your Ministry; pleade your preheminence! Yet least declining age in favour should, Of thy concurrent over-partial prove, Exalt thy lights, thou still prevailing Love! Raise here th'Exemplar of th'ensuing work, To shew th'Incredulous how from crippled Time Thou wilt extract the last Perfection: And thou, the splendid glory of my Age! To whose high neigb'ring Summet I am come By secret paths; maintain thou still thine own! Thy gaudy train attracts the wanton Eye Of woman more, than all the flourishing Grace Of Youth Fix here m'intentive thoughts your strength, And on the fabrick of Ambition Frame Iove a Temple; where if his Object may No prove Loves pledge; she may prove Honours Prey. Casts his eye on a Letter he held in his hand. First here's a swelling cloud must be remov'd, Whose progress threatens to eclips your Lights. Castrophilus Death is crown'd in victory, Whose Glories, still surviving, in his Sonn, The People rule more powerfully than Law: And by Ambigamor his friend pretends To wed fair Orgula. So fooles conclude E're they consult those powers do them preside. I am their Fate; 'tis fixt in my Decree, In Love and Rule there must no Rival be. Nefarius!âHow dull a thing is passive Man, Whom ev'ry giddy vapour uncreates, Fittest my use. 'Tis Pollicies defect, T'imploy such spirits may their wayes detect. Ho! Nefarius? Nefarius ent. N. My Lord. S. Holds Castrophilus Funeral Triumph this day N. Such is the voice of Fame my Lord: S. See that perform'd, as you finde order'd there. Delivers im a Paper. N. I shall, with diligence equal to your trust. exeunt Scene 2. The Princess Eumena with Zisania and other waiters above at a window. Castrophilus Funeral Triumph attended by Ludaster, Ambigamor, Gratianus, Libranus, Serverus, Fidelius and others. Eu. Is that Ludaster follows next the Hearse? Zis. Madam it is: The Ornament of our Age: Eu. Th'excellence of his Form and Grace compar'd Unto his Fame, could hardly be mistook By whom ne're seen; Both are so singular. Zis. Hath not your Highness seen him formerly? Eu. Not within bounds of perfect Memory. Zis. So Time in me had slight Impressions rac'd, To her self. Had not ev'n then, Love plac't his Figure here. Lu. What silent Extasie hath seiz'd this place: Can Joy nor Grief expresse a sense of Life? Amb. Sure the security we bring hath rac't The Mem'ry of Past, and fear of Future Ills, And, now, as useless hath intomb'd them both Without a monument, in Neglect and Ingratitude. Gra. Where are those glittering Pageants, who were wont With fauning Ceremony to come and gaze On her with wonder they durst never seem To court, but with a distance of reproach? Is the Aborde of victory become Less agreeable, exposing thus the path That to her leads in this sad Testimony. An Attend. Your faith in me, my Lords, may plead excuse For them you seem to blame, when I shall shew 'Tis not their inclination doth restraine The Peoples Hearts to publish their Respects, But a severe injunction from the Lord Protector. Lu. My jealousie craves pardon, Obedience is the ground of civil Rule, Which, thus prevailing 'bove Affection, Formes them both worthy and susceptible Of their ensuing greatness. Serjeant at Armes ent. meets the Hearse. Ser. In our Dread Soveraigns name, authorized By vertue of our Lord Protector's Order, Castrophilus of the Segusian Force Late General, I do Arrest for Treason. Lu. With a more powerful guid possess me Heav'n! Than what but meerly doth distinguish man From Beast! I may restrain the wildness of My Passion, which swells to a Distemper, High as their Fury: Reason is too weak. Or if not for our Safety, for your Truth, Least vainly we conclude ye have forsook Unguarded Innocence. Draws his Sword. Gra. Shall we have toyl'd his Honour to preserve When yet alive, not vindicate his Fame Now Dead? Lu. This nor becomes your Duty, nor your Love; Guilt puts on force: Vertue waves violence. Our wrongs to the Prescription of the Laws Prin at a window. Must here give place. Gra. It is the curse of Arms to raise a pow'r Puts up his Sword. In Form, must suppress theirs in Right: Sr. my rudeness will be I hope excus'd By my Integrity. Which would advise To provide timely for security. Indignities are offered to the Dead Obliquely but reflect upon the Living. Eu. What mystery masks this disorder? To Lud. An Attend. The Princes Sr. To the Pr. Lu. With a respect low as my obedience, Madam, your vassal doth present your Grace, From this sad Relique of Fidelity, A Balsome to preserve your Beauty fresh Against th'assaults of Age; smoothing your thoughts With soft tranquility; which else perhaps The anxious burden of your State would with Their churlish Summons soon precipitate; A work so laden with fertility, The feeble stock sunk under the support, Whose Monuments Epitaph him dignifies Your Peace and Glories grateful sacrifice. Eu. How powerfully work the charms of Love. To her self. Ludaster. Acceptance and Acknowledgement, Too meanly speak my Gratitude in thanks. Maturity of time shall it invest With fairer Ornaments I'th' interim know I must divide my Interests with yours, And in th'exchange participate of both; You of my Glory to moderate your Grief; I of your Grief to moderate my Glory. Whose price with a new Triall I'de redeem, Though the Event were to be doubtfull made By his declining from the Action. But why, Ludaster, this interruption Of your Obsequies? Lu. Madam, the wayes of mischief are Too crooked and obscure for erect thoughts To penetrate; and leaves who should inform Lost in a silent Labyrinth of wonder. Yet thus much doth th'Infancy discover; Mallice endeavours to stir up a cloud Might smother vertues memory, Seising the sacred Ashes of the Dead For a pretended crime of Treason. Eu. This subject might an anger have provok't, Had not thy Fathers long approved Faith Shook off the levity of this ground, with scorn In every mans belief that hath but heard The empty Accents of his name. Lu. Yet bears the charge an appearance of Guilt, Till by your Laws 'tis clear'd, for whose free course I must appeal your Grace, the Sanctuary Of Innocence. Eu. Though my youths Immaturity as yet, Suspend me from th'advantage of my Birth: I must procure, what Justice cann't deny, To punish the suggestors of this infamy, For which attend our Order Lu. Your Highness Birth and Goodness doubly do Intitle you to our Obedience. Ex. Scene 3. Senevero. 'Tis wisdom's property to frame redress To each repugnance of our doubtfull Fate, We may evade her Lawes necessity, And wrest her Power to our purposes, By the plurality of means we form To guide us to our ends: To which effect I must attempt to fortifie my Branch, His tender youth may cherish and sustain Our fortunes flourishing fertilitie. Filathes ent. Filat. encounterd in a discontented posture. Filathes! How! So full of thought, alone? What noble subject entertains thy Soul Can justifie so firm a solitude? 'Tis not the idle dreams of Schooles, take on The specious title of Philosophy, Can do't: Nor yet those Gyves Morality Hath forg'd to force the functions of the Soul To Rule: As she were to dimension Subject. Ease hath those useless trifles wrought T'excuse the sloth of Natures vacant works, She in the world superfluously hath cast: Thy Birth and Fate call thee to greater things. I am surpris'd.âSr. if the Restriction To himself. Of my thoughts hath figur'd to your sense An unbecoming sadness; 'twas only The care to be in Action responsive To their Summons. I might be worthy held Those happy Beings, I extract from You, And your fair Industry. Which Intention With success to make good; I must request The matter from your hand in some imploy, On which I may a lasting glory raise. My name may be no blemish to your story. Si. The fervour of thy youth I like, but not Approve; be wise, and vainly not pursue The inessential appearance of things: Tast of the fruit, and glut thee with the food Of Greatness: Leave the Ayery Pompe to those Who fondly toyl their servitude to frame. Let my experience trace thee out a way Securely leads to thy Felicity. All those endowments grace thy youth, are wont To make Loves pursuit happy in success: Prove their attaints on this fair Object we Intitle to our Soveraignty. Loves rules Regard not Policies distinctions. Be Bold, Attempt and Thrive. Fi. How indiscreet a sence my secret flame To himself. Would, unrestrained, to this purpose vent. NefÃ¦rius enters. Si. Nefarius! Turns to Nefa. Filathes attend me on the Terrace. Turns to Fila. exit Fila. And how Nefarius? did the Souldiers Plumes Couch their exalted heads? who swell'd with rage? And who, with a more suff'ring dislike shrunk His intelligent shoulders? whose shaking head His wary Reservation, next, implyed? Who with erected or reverted eye, Dispenc't the cautions of his Jealousie? These Notions are of consequence, Nefarius. Ne. Your Honour shall know ev'ry circumstance In fitter time. The Princes, now at hand, Expects your conference on this subject: Si. How comes it to her ear so suddenly. Ne. To the proceeding she a witnesse was. Si. My Order then was not observ'd with care, Which charg'd you to divert her by some slight. Ne. Such motives, often prest, were oft repulst. Ex. Ne. Si. Return, I come, who would unblamed strike, Must what he seems to do, not seem to like. Ex. Si. Scene 4. Libranus Serverus. Lib. Sad! Serverus? Dejection ill becomes The Demeanour of a Souldier. Ser. Not so Libranus, When fram'd o'th useles sense of others wrongs: True valors object solely seated is On others Interests, to which unblemisht she Yeelds up her self, though not unto our own. Lib. But thus opprest, is to betray our cause To an ill Omen; we immov'd have stood The Chance of war; and far more firmly should Expect faire vertues Triall. Ser. The Chance of War Lesse fatall is to Arms, than slights of Peace, Wherein, our open plainnesse doth expose Our carelesse lives to ev'ry Artifice Of close Supercherie. But see they come, Lets wait the Issue. In great solemnity the Judge with the Court of Justice, Officers goes before the Hearse, whom Nefarius busily entertains, as also two Advocates, the one as Plaintiffe being Atturney Generall for the State, the other as Defendant for Castrophilus. Next the Hearse, Ludaster, Ambigamor, Gratianus, Fidelius and others. Lib. Hah! so busie in obsequiousnesse! Open Corruption unsuspected slides Into the hearts of Men, under the form Of Ceremony: So Custome gelds the Law. Ser. Thou err'st Libranus, in that thou think'st not The Introduction more material. The Judges set. Judge. Exhibit the Charge. Reg. Castrophilus of the Segusian Force The Court Register reads. Late General, refused his Commission To yeeld up to our Protectors Order, By which inhibited to fight, provokt The Enemy to unsought Encounter, To th'hazard of the State. Att. Gen. Crimes, in their nature clear Require no further Sense to give them weight; On such t'enlarge with Circumstance or Art Were not t'enlighten, but to aggravate: In which suggestion, Justice, weakly fenc't, Might be too soon surpris'd with appearance. Which to avoid; my Honourable Lords, I shall with Artless brevity relate Th'inormity of the Offence, exposed To your Judgements. First, to your considerations I present Th'Indignity to our Soveraignes Substitute, In contempt of his Order, whose only will Bore weight enough to lend it consequence. Had not th'obscured Glory of that State, To whom our better Fate hath joyned ours, (Ev'n in her fullest pride) by her example (Effectual as her transferr'd Laws) prescib'd A certain Course to our security From her suff'rings, in continuation Of her Offices. Which dangerous step To Ambition, her first Innovator, Cesar, in his own personal practice sound, And remedied, at his return to Rome, Perfixing tearms unto the PrÃ¦torie And Consulate. This onely for the ground Of the Injunction which followed With disobedience, the overthrow Of government: intrudes a president (The supplement to all defective Laws) From our preceding Pattern; Who sentenc'd to be whipt his Ingenier, For that he rather chose to fail this Rule Of Rule; then that Rule of his Art, which held A known repugnance to his Masters will: To which ensues, yet a more weighty crime, The hazard of our Liberties and Lives Rashly thrust on one moments doubtfull trial, In opposition to Authority. Changes in States, 'specially succeeded By minoritie, are held no seasons fit To tempt th'incertitude of Arms: wherein Faults irrepairable are seldome twice Committed: whose issues, though succesful, when Inhibited that Romans censure merrit; Which to his son triumphs applause denies, And crown'd the victor but for Sacrifice. Ad. De. My honoured Lords, In Decimo Sexto Patravis. Lud. Forbear vain babler, Lu. puts the Ad. by with his hand from the Bar. Sullie not a Cause with thy impertinence Needs no defence from mercinary form; Her purity to blemish were a Cryme, Great as the Charge suggest's,âHow suddenly Pause. Incensed wrongs become licentious: Against the Order of the Court, I fear, I do transgresse; thus rudely to assume A Liberty; but by your grace allow'd, Ju. Proceed. Bows to the Judge Lu. T'omit the ground pretended to revoke, The progresse of our Arms, though in it self Disputable: since he but once remov'd Successor to the President alledg'd, More subtle far than he, it practised With success, as the immediate means T'establish his security. But this, With common Preservation ballanced, Will easily, with your assent, admit A contradiction in the consequence. And though the works necessity appear, Not to each vulgar eye, Experience And Observance, hath confirm'd the Master Of the Mystrie therein, for whose account He onely is responsible to heav'n. The Function of General, solely being To Soveraignty inherent; whose presence Heretofore authoris'd all proceeding, Till a corrupter Age, through ease and lux, Induc't a substitute, who still retains Th'essentiall marks of his Original; Exacts the Rites of National Laws abroad; Supports the course of civill laws at home; And with his moving Commonwealth transports A Law peculiar to his Ministrie: Which he reforms, or abrogates at Will; Dispenseth Honour, from his proper source; Divides the spoyle as freely as his own. Nor can the nature of his Action Agree with order, limit; or restaint; Which Subject are, to method time and place, From whose varying occurrents he by eye Takes new advice, to guide his purposes. Whence expeditions of this qualitie, Prove seldome happy but in silence seal'd. Nor can th'objected Presidents be of force Inferring only, how far this pow'r, now In question, extends it self o're others, Not how far others power over it. Which may in fairer evidence appear, To justifie our Cause (if presidents Be received) when you shall recollect, How Fabius first the Cimmian Mountains past. Divide the Roman from the Thoscan Coast, Without the Senates consent or advice, From whom their Tribunes and their Deputies Beeing sent with strict Defence to stop his course, He not desisted from his enterprise, Which happily he finished, without A farther Contestation. Judg stands up. Ju. Whereas the littr'al sence of Laws do not Exactly touch the Nature of th'offence; We may from Presidents receive advice; But yet no Rule, in that the circumstance Of their depending Causes are to us Not published. In which Case, our recourse Must to the light of Nature be; Reason, Laws Principal; who from her self should erre, Should she great Crimes neglect, &amp; yet the small Suppresse; for in her silence so she should, Were not great crimes forbidden in the less. Which, cautious, she forbore to specifie, Seing mans froward frailty still did take New violence from restraint: Jealous t'awake His faculty, in her invention. Such is the subject now in difference, Our Laws i'th letter not precisely mark, But from the Relative and Comparative sence We may disclose the full necessity Of her Intention in the consequence. Which cannot be the Branches to preserve, And leave the Root affords them nourishment: Which here the Person, and his Act transgrest, Do truly represent: For of what use Are Magistrates, their Head being disobeyed, Or in their mouths the Laws, if who them fram'd May in their own Injunctions be gainsayd With impunity. Yet farther th'offence In the dependance doth extend it self: Exposing the security of the State, Without necessity, to a doubtfull chance; Which in well-govern'd Common-wealths are shunn'd To 'th last extremity: And then not past, Without a gen'ral Consultation, Whose advise slighted or contraried, In such important actions, doth deserve (What e're the issue he) the punishment Of high Treason, Whereof I do pronounce Castrophilus guilty. Yet least the rigour O'th Law should seem in vengeance to delight, Who strikes but by example to correct; His body fre'd from our community, We undisturbed leave to Funeral Rites; But what of him remains with us must suffer: His Honours are in degradation loft, His goods to'th publique Treasure forfeited. His Son and Allies judg'd to Banishment, Not as Complices to the present Crime, The Souldiers seem to weep. But as to further Crimes prevention. Dissolve the Court. Exit Judg. and their Attend. Lud. How soon affection doth communicate To others sufferings. Thus feeble sorrow Doth un-man the soul. Why thus dejected? Do you vainly think, that valour only Is the practice of the field? The Subject Of your displeasures is impassible; Or if in being still, he would again His innocent life, with cheerfulnesse, yeeld up, In favour of the course of Justice, Without a secret murmur. Gra. His vertue of too frequent usage was Amongst us all, to doubt the excellence, Whose glorious Mem'ry our Ages malice May vail awhile, but can extinguish never. This, nor the scandal to our Industry, As subsequent to His; moves an excess In our just sufferings, though either may, Without Reproach, a just resentment challenge. But the expansion of his worth cut off, From us and Action, in your weightier wrongs. Lud. Their relation to you, but make them such Seems to yeeld to passion. To me. Th'effects of love more strongly move Than of Enmity. Lib. Our swords are the best speakers of our loves And wrongs: whose use, each man that hath a sense Of vertue, must without reserve, yeeld up To the defence of yours. Lud. Reserve your valours for a worthier cause, Your Interests and the States must never be Oppos'd by mine, Thare friendship never was S'indiscreet, to prejudice the Owner, Nor my Faith my Country. Amb. Come; I have salve for all thy sufferings, Embraces Lud. Whose splendour shall through these disorders move True satisfaction from the sphear of Love. Scene 4. Orgula, Vergena, Amasia. One with a Cabinet of Jewels, another a looking-glass. Or. So! now the distance of your servitude Suspend a while. And to be free as thought; Say, whose beauty holds the loudest Tennor In the voice of Fame? Ver. Madam! the question in it self implies More than the Resolution can admit; Propension in the quality. To dispute The preheminence of your beauty; is to raise A doubtfull concurrent to its glory, And make th'excellence of anothers form, More considerable i'th' comparison, Than in their own perfection. Or. This to Eumena were but passible: Obsequiousnes the true attendant is Of Greatness. Amb. Under your Honours favour, the Homage Of beauty far more universal is, Than that of Majestie: by so much ods, As natures bounds doth Policies extend. And if th'excess of praise, from servile thoughts, Be licenc'd, as the badge of Soveraginty, Although conducing but to its reproach: The ornaments of our Expressions (From a delightfull Rapture issuing) May be authoriz'd as the grace of love, Which tendeth but t'exalt the lustre of His object. Or. From whence I may collect, you would infer My beauty must receive addition From your flatteries. Am. Pardon me, Madam, not so; perfection doth admit No alt'ration; increase, implies defect. But yet the satisfaction which doth spring From the applause we give, may animate The hidden sources of its influence Which reflects on us. Or. My Faith is not so powerfull to make use Of this conclusion to the advantage Of mine. Amb. It moves not in his proper Element From the equality of Sex: But when By your pretenders it is published, Th'effects will be more sensible. Or. Well! Not to resist the nature of our Sex, Who soonest credit, what we covet most. Agreement shall this controversie close; And move another from your last evasion. Distinguish the pretenders you propound, And presse th'advantage you conceive they held Over each other to make good their ends. Amb. Madam, Amongst the number of your unsought spoiles, Two only are considerable. The one With Wealth and Power fully dignified, (Two strong motives to a womans Temper.) The other with Vertue and true Valour As amply qualified: Which with the former Paralel'd, doth no proportion hold In their true values, to dispute their worths. Divest but the Coloss of Wealth and Power From their ostentive Bulks and limit them To their peculiar use, they will appear But Ministers to Necessity and Right, Whose functions, bounteous nature, &amp; good men Make useless. If as they are in common Usage taken, they will be found but aids To Wantonness and Oppression. Whose yoke They doubly suffer, that to them submit; Of Greatness ev'n the endearments are but Insulting suffrages. While Vertue doth Erect a Bower, Love in Repose to Throne And Valour from licentious tongues protects Our Fame, Uer. A meer Platonick Rapture, Madam, Deduc't from the first Infancy of Time, When Innocent man yet hardly knew the use Of his own natural faculties. Vertue is but the Fable now of Schooles; Nor Valour but the hardinesse of Fooles; Whose ends should be from evill us to free, Not with neglect to tempt them to our ruine, 'Gainst which they potent safeguards are, she slights In the comparison. And most of all To us important. For the Soul ev'n from The nature of her first extraction, holds A strong desire of Rule. From which our Sex, Excluded in the Politick Body, gains In the Natural, by the advantage Of our Beauty. Whose vigour were more pow'rful And legitimate, I will grant, then that Of violence: since to us Inclination Rendreth our Subjection voluntary. And farther succour we should never want Our Empire to confirm, did not the Rites Of time too suddenly prevaile against, The Rites of our Prerogative; whose Pow'r To frustrate, least it ours supplant, to it We timely must a counter-party raise (While yet we have the means it to procure) May our failing Authority support. Which to us more assured cannot be Than to acquire an opulent Dignity. Or. A pretty slight to free us from th'contempt Of Age, whose unwelcome approaches make Our beeings uselesse, oft ridiculous. Mundola with Ambigamor and Ludaster Enters. Mun. Madam, Your Honours Brother. Amb. Sister, Salute I joy to finde the Messenger of fame, Though glorious, yet too mean a Speaker Of thy Form: It meets the expectation Here at the full, Her flatteries else where, Leave void, ev'n in the first examination, And yeelds an evidence of thy modesty, More powerfull, than are those Virgin stains Revert the Guilt upon the loose Attempter: In that we may from thence conclude, thy care Nor studied was, nor vain, too lavishly Those Graces to communicate to each Lascivious sense, with Arts affetterie Which bear the Figure of Divinity. Or. Brother, Those attributes you give, if plac't in me, Have found a happy way to please th'Owner, If you in them be satisfied. Amb. I am, and shall more perfectly, when they Are placed here. Amb. presents to Or. Ludaster. My thoughts can to themselves propound No safer guides, than your Intensions. Lud. Madam, they are not fair to you in this, I must be, thought to my own affliction, Their dilatour. Since they can onely make. M'happy, but with the brand of treachery, T'would, in each vulgar eye, too ill become The Honour of our friendship, to betray The Myracle of Nature to th'possession Of a thing so mean, it wants a sense To signifie its being: Man; is too high A dignity to qualifie my essence; To him inherent are Habitations, Distinctions, possessions, in all which, I Can no way find, the smalest Property Beast; though th'unruly motions of my thoughts Approach their Nature, have a happier sense, For of them all they know no difference. Amb. Forbear you wrong our amitie; Our beings individual are. Or. Sir, Whence this distemper, flows, I cannot guess; But far unsutable, I'm sure, it is To Lu. The Character both good and knowing men Deliver of you. Man without reproach Can safely speak himself in no extream. Amb. Thy innocence frees thee fro'th suspect of guilt; Thou would'st not else suppose vertue could be Without Oppression: Orgulea, I more Plain must be with thee; In my long absence, My thoughts incessantly have toyled more Under the anxious burden of my care To see that beauty in an happy Porte, Then t'acquire the glory of a Souldier. M'Eye hath been nice, as wantonnesse of youth; My judgement wary, as jealousie of Age, In search of Him, might my endeavours crown. Which that a happy period might ensue, When sound, I in my letters figured Him to thee, as Fancy would a Fable, Yet swerv'd not from the truth, I might not lead But mark thy inclination out, the which Thy Love in thy obedience had giv'n ore To mine: veiw here the true originall. From whom, malice her self can naught detract, Though she his Honours and Possessions hath, Cut off from him, &amp; whats worse, him from us. Or. Your resolutions do beget new doubts. Amb. Hath not the rumour of our sufferings Preceeded us? Mischief is conscious When she dares but whisper. Why? Orgeula, Our glorious victory is, by the Law, To Him we ow for it, imputed Treason; And as such punished in Him and His. Or. It can not be, You would but sport with my credulity. Amb. I'm serious; on my integrity. Or. You'de astonish me. Amb. Shake of thy trouble and thy doubts; we will Seek out a clime, where goodness shall live free From Injury. Or. Women Travellers are held no members fit For new discoveries; as I conceive, The title of a Lady errant will Unto our Honours no addition be. Amb. But that of Pilgrim doth grace Piety. Or. The Zeal Of my Devotion not so fervent is. Amb. Thy words do into errour prompt my sense, Yet rain I would mistake, explain thy self; Let vertue be thy guide. Or. Our lives have other props then speculation Amb. Reflect not o'th breaches of His fortunes, They are made good in mine. Or. Twill but ill become your fathers daughter To be said your Pentionarie. Amb. Hast thou thy appearance so suddenly Cast off? Awake, and reassume thy Temper. Or. Did the Conjecture of my worth extend But to your bare Esteem, it would have taught Simplicity, so far to prize it self, As to preserve the Rites of Woman-hood. We women are not wonn with the Reports Of glory: Our accesses have degrees. Why? Had you met my wishes in your choice, He must, with the observance of a slave, Have ages waited but for my Admittance, Have kist my Hand, he must have thrice redeemed With hazzard of his life, my fame; not from Reproach alone, but from Preheminence. Facility is beauties Infamy. Amb. Nay, then I, must conclude, that Beauty is From Heav'n amongst us onely cast, as a Misplaced light, but to seduce the world. Lu. Madam! Disfigure not that Character you bear: O're Mis'ry to insult, those graces will Devest of their Divinity: and leave Them smothered in a cloud of Horrour. I do not come to violate the Rites Of Love; But those of Friendship to preserve, Which tendered; I take my leave. Amb. Farewell thou Maquery of Nature. Ex Lu. Amb. Uer. These Souldiers have not learnt the patience yet T'attend the issue of a Seige, I see. They are so hot on the Encounter. Am.

Alone? Madam? Where are the fluent Concourse of our youth, Should with inspired zeal exalt their vowes To your Divinity? are they from this Sequestred, in that they have of it A Prophanation made to meaner Dieties? Or of those Charming Graces do thou thus Into their center recontract their force? They may with greater violence effuse Their light, by this sought Intermission, And so each time they are disclos'd, possesse The world with a new Miracle? Madam, Affect a meaner way to propagate The glory of your beauty: t'will involve The world with lesse amazment, but with more Delight: which fully to beget, there must Be more equality betwixt th'Object And the Faculty. Or. Y'ave taught me Sir, a pretty Art, in your Reproof, to fill that disproportion In my own defects: Sin. Madam! The Splendour of your Arms subdues, You need not ad their force: yet you my words To their contrary Sense do thus invert: Whose truth to justifie; witness all eyes, Save such as shame and envy do corrupt; Your own Glasse, and my Captivity. Or. Your Captivity! Sure the prescriptions have a large extent. Sin. That, Madam, I must learn of your consent Offers to kiss her. Or. How, Sir, forbear; y'ave learnt the mystery Of equivokes, I see; yet you mistake she puts him by Ver. is staid by Sin. who gives her a Ring. This freedome marks not my intention; But that which gives you license to be gone. Sin. Her wit yet adds a lustre to her form: Or. &amp; Amb. Ex. This Ring to help me to another view Of your fair Lady. Ver. As fit as it were made for me, in truth. Sir, I accept your proffer, yet must doubt You buy your Pennance at too dear a rate. I will attempt if you dare undertake. Sin. Fear not; the danger of her eyes (If I In vain must burn) is but Loves Sacrifice. Ver. Hast to the farther Galery, I'le lead her that way to her Chamber. Ex. sundry wayes. Scene 4. Lizania. The Conflict of my minde devides it self, Yet in Loves favour must suspend Loves Rite; The troubles of his hazzard whom I love, Oppress my thoughts more than my love's successe; Which yet so doubtfull is, I cannot say, When he shall know it, doth my passion sway. Wayt. Madam, the Lord A Wayt. Ent. Ambigamor desires your Conference. Liz. Attend him hither. How unwelcome are to us the Summons Of misplac't affection; when as our thoughts T'other Object are equally engag'd. Th'excess of Love, when it not ours meets, Afflicts as doth the want of what we seek. Yet I perhaps of him may somewhat learn To pacifie my apprehension. The Wayter after some intermission conducts him in and returns. Ambigamor Ent Amb. As day springs from the bosome of the night, With comfort, to the wandring traveller. So from my absence flows to me this light, Whose fair Idea hath unblemisht here Been kept alive in that obscurity, By the refulgence of the flames of Love, That to you Madam, now do come to prove, Which is more fatall, Contention or Love. Liz. 'Tis well y'ave scap'd the greatst hazard, Sir, The force of Love was never mortal thought, To such especially, whose heart diverts The violence in a division Of his strength, 'twixt a Mistress and a Friend. Amb. The Passion for my friend serves but to form Ant receptacle to install my Love, Whose Rites (though it your censure should confirm) Must somwhats intermit in favour of His Interests; which yet may happy prove If you vouchsafe to be their Advocate. Liz. As how, I pray? Amb. Madam, the rigour of the Law this night Expels Ludaster forth his Country's bounds, She seems troubled. Unless you by our Soveraigns means procure His Reaple, This silence, Madam, speaks Your trouble more than your consent. Liz. The cause of vertue should universal be In well affected minds; and sure in mine Not with such sense receiv'd might question My Agreement to the succour, to which I will addresse my self forthwith, and e're The Evening close inform you the successe. Amb. I wish the glory of your undertaking May not rest onely in your fair intention.

T'was enforced to awake the one To lend the other Faculty. Eu. My thoughts have, since thy absence, strangely wrought Pause OnâI know not, what unform'd purposes. Liz. Under your Highnesse favour, this is but The last dimension to the Appearance; The growth is of a longer Beeing; I Have watch't to the progression the degrees, Your speech abruptly intermits and flows: The Offices of Night and Day in you So strangely intermixed are of late, I know not when you slumber, when you wake. Pardon my Curiosity, if it Too nighly hath approacht your Privacy. The freedome formerly you used me to Hath been in fault; which never did admit A secret so long hid. Eu. Alas! Lizania, 'tis yet such to me, I am not well acquainted with my own Distempers; which insensibly, I finde, Do grow upon my yeelding Nature. Liz. My own sufferings are my best informers, To her self Madam, if I might have the liberty. To judge, I truly should affirm it Love. Witnesse the rising tincture on your cheek, Which masks it self in guilt, unwittingly To have disclos'd more than I should have known. Eu. Thy rashness hath a bolder title given To my Passion, than yet my Virgin thoughts Durst to themselves a vouch: which now become More hardy are by their discovery. And press to move thy succour and advice. Liz. Your Power over mine may challenge both, Which in the int'rim, I must intercede For the Protection of the innocent: Then waite th'enlightning of your purposes Eu. Alas! mine fails me in my own Interests. Yet shall not that form an excuse to thee, Might figure a denial: whose is the Cause? Liz. Ludaster's Exile moves for Reaple. Eu. The first report thereof was thereto my Direction: which to thy Father often I in vain have prest, whereto still h' objects, I know not what, hid mysteries of State. Not knowing that on his depends my Fate. Eu. Why starts thou? Liz. starts. To her self. Liz. How sudden and unruly is the sense Of Love: Madam, the apprehension Of the Consequence. If your Fate follow His, ye both are to us lost. Eu. Not lost to thee; nor, yet from thee divided; Thy amity assures me that thou wilt Participate with me in any change. Liz. That were the smallest triall of my Faith. Eu. Know then I am resolv'd, only with thee, This Night (since I his exile can not stay) To follow by my flight: which to secure, As we the fresh ayre of the Ev'ning take, We of the Forest will our Covert make. Liz. Your Highness sought my advice with my Ayd, Yet you conclude without it. Eu. That in the sequell I perhaps may use; But where Necessity hath left no choice, Counsel is vain. Liz. Yet Madam your attention let me crave, I shall submit to your Election. Eu. What canst thou say? Liz. Under your Graces favour, you to chance Precipitate, what time infallibly Must without hazzard ripen to your hand; And leave you Pow'r to cancell this Edict, As it had never been. Eu. My thoughts are fixt, prepare thee to their aide, Attempt no more my Passion to or'esway. Time hath many Changes: Love brooks no delay. Eu. Ex. Liz. How full of opposition is my Fate. Each Accident begets a new repugnance To my Hopes: And to extend my suffrings, Endeavours me to frame their Instrument. So wills the duty to my Soveraign.

Ziz. Sir, My fear perswades me I already have Disclos'd thereto an obstacle, greater, Than time or prudence can remove. Sin. What may that be? The discovery may in your censure Blemish me with the reproach of levity, So facilly to break a trust impos'd By the affection of my Soveraign, Which no violence should have wrested from me, Were not the ruin of the state engaged In the privacy.

Whereby she of her Non-age had the term Anticipated: Me of my dignity And Pow'r devested: My Enemy Brought in with triumph to take full revenge On me and my Complices. To this is The influence of those erring Lights preside The Offices of Nature directed: But well digested Reason, who us frees, From the subjection of the sense: In which Fraile Element their Empire onely moves, Propounds a fairer Issue to my Hopes, In the Conversion of their fatall Order.

More noble far, Though not so Popular; whose fame is rais'd Not on the loud voice of the multitude; But on the secret approbation Of the Good. A Glory stable, 'cause not Envied. A Tryumph not enriched With the Spoils of others: the price whereof Is not the Widows nor the Orphans tears. Alas! the happy issue of this strife Tends not t'extinguish, but reforme a life, Which Man too vainly seeking to cherrish, Dissipates, catching at things unusefull, Or superfluous, with such a greedy toil, As his Existence meerly did depend On his own Industry: to which he wades Through any difficulty: meets the vastest Limmits of the Sea: Laies ope' the secret'st Shadows of the Deep; And to each end his Servile thoughts put on a several form, And like a desperate Gamester casts at All; As if the spacious world for All was fram'd, Too little were for one. How sweet a change my thoughts already prove! Here no Alarum breaks a calm Repose, Which gently slides but to discharge the debt Of Nature, and without starts discloses As the Day; invited with the cheerfull Notes of the Hu'n neighbouring Quire to view The smooth face of Nature, which even smiles With an affected flattery to charm The soul in her deep speculation: In which immoved with a future care, She waits her flight, till she almost forget Her Mansion's ministry.

Tis but the fervor of thy will lends thee Abilitie. The strictnesse of thy Love Must not oppresse thy Nature; be advis'd. Fi. If your Intention tend to cast me off? Proceed yet more directly; let me know The Cause; My vanity, as yet, was ne're So indiscreet to think I might not err: Nor yet my frailty so indocile, as To render a Correction frivolous. If my Attendance, too Officiously, Prest with untimely duty, interrupt The secret entertainment of your thoughts; I will restrain it to a Modesty, Indifferent as neglect; though it will be More difficult then assiddutie To me. Or if, as improfitable, You would discarde me, a superfluous charge; I will inure these hands, though yet unapt, To make my service usefull. Lu. How! infinitly beyond all Art extends The Innocence of thy expressions! I could stand Ages here, still as the Night, To hear thee plead to have; what, Nations fight To shun. Thy servitude. In troth, 'tis well Thy happy Nature guides thee to be good. Thou hast a native faculty would else All justice have corrupted. I must yeeld. Thou shalt henceforth receive no Rule beyond Thy own direction. Do as thou wilt. Yet I would have thee secretly depart From hence, to find Ambigamor my Friend, Him only of my being here inform. And farther let him know, I lately have Intelligence of some disorders sprung, 'Mongst our disbanded troups; which to appease (If yet their fury start beyond their murmur) I here am plac't at hand in this disguise: And shall be succour'd, when occasion calls, By some dispersed troups Gratianus Holds in hand with hope of new Imployment. Fi. I strictly shall observe your will; And with a speedy diligence return. Lu. Not so, Fidelius, I would have thee stay Sometime with him, the better to direct His Messages to me; and cautious be When thou return'st of thy Discovery. Fi. Though naught in me pretendeth to avail, Save Prayer. My absence of your safety will Be jealous. Heav'n be your safeguard Sr. Lu. Farwell, my pretty Boy farewell. Ex. Fi. Such Love would melt an unrelenting Heart. All my misfortunes, fluent as they are, Have not forc't from me so much woman yet: Seems to weep. Gratianus Ent. Gratianus! so suddenly, thou preced'st My Expectation: what news abroad? Gra. strange news Sir, news Will awake all that is Man about us. Lu. Thy earnestnes doth intercept thy hast: What is't? Gra. The Princess, Sir, is given out for lost. Lu. Good heav'n forbid! as how? Gra. Fled, as pretented is; a hood for fools. But those that have but half their senses, Sir, Must judge there's jugling in't. The Fox's train Grows rank; and I prepare me for the Chase. Lu. Temper thy Ardour to a soft restraint, Thy rashness will ore-throw our purposes. Gra. Why? can you to them e're expect to find A fairer Introduction? Lu. Thou dost mistake, I question not the ground To be sufficient to declare our selves; But think it wanteth time to ripen it. Perhaps the Princess is thus privately Retyred onely to some holy Place For her devotion. Perhaps sequestred From the importunate tumult of the Court, To make her pleasures more agreeable. Perhaps this rumour may suggested be But to intrap a blinde Temerity. Gra. You say well; or this, or that may be; In womens ways is little certainty. Y'are better read in Politiques, than I; I know no vertue, but Fidelity; Nor vice, but want of courage: what is, Sir, To be done? Lu. Time will bring truth to light; wait yet a while, Set Spies to gather perfect Evidence: Dispose your troups in readiness: and then Repair to me, we on the manner will Deliberate. Gra. This shall be done immediately; but how If in th'interim you should discover'd be? Lu. In case I should; I fear no violence, But from the County Officers Since I Assure my self, no Souldier will attempt Th'Attachement of my Person. Gra. You may, upon my life, be confident On their Loves. But how resist the other? Lu. I have th'advantage of the Hill, and on The least emotion will a signall give By flag, by day; by fire in the night. Gra. I shall be vigilant, and certain in My succour: Heav'n favour our Endeavours To repair your wrongs. Lu. Thanks, honest, Gratianus; make no stay; As haste is dangerous, so may prove delay.</field>

My Fears pursue me still; each noise awakes The terrour of another violence More hatefull than the former. Certainly The mark of theft should be Necessity, Which here seems smother'd in a vast excesse, To lodge no force, if not of wantonness. Yet here misfortunes threatnings do not stay, Sure if they did my Plaints were vain; since I Have resolution to escape their malice. Ills are scarce such which have their remedy: Which wanting is, alas, to Loves restraint, Whose jealous visions evils multiply On every empty possibility.

It can be but some idle Rumour sprung From the distemper'd heat of wine: when as The giddy Fantasie works high upon Each slight Impression to make the tongue Licentious: It is impossible! Admit it true: what would vain Hope infer? That I agreeing to Sinevero, Stand fairest to succeed her Dignity. Love interdicts that fond Reflection. Tush! Beauty, if not joyn'd with Majesty, Is honour'd but for sensuality. 'Tis well attempted to suppresse my flame, Yet vainly do my thoughts avouch to what They cannot frame, and with a false apparrell Palliate my wound. Mundelo Enter. Mu. Madam, the Princes is, for certain, lost. Or. For certain then another must be found. The Practice of the world hath made thee wise, Mundolo, which teacheth thee to value All publique dammages, no farther than Our private Interests do on them depend. Mu. 'Twas your Command that chang'd the Property. Or. Which errour now my second thoughts have found, And blame that troubled curiosity. Which to overpass, tell me, Mundolo, What youth is that come lately to my Brother? Or in what quality received? Mu. His business speaks him a Messenger; His Privacy a friend, beyond both which, I yet have nothing learnt particular Of him. Or. Thou hast then lost thy sensuall faculty. Mu. What means your honour to conclude of mine Beyond the information of your own? Or. Can any Eye, if not defective, See and not judge him Natures miracle. Mu. So far from that, mine cannot judge in what: Or. Is not his form exactly excellent? Mu. More than the bashfull smoothness of his years, Which reach not yet to the distinction Of his Sex; I can not see. Or. Thou stupid art beyond credulity. Mundolo, while yet I was an Infant, My Father, of a slave, designed thee To my Attendance: since I have found thee Diligent and faithfull to my Purposes. Mu. Your honour's Testimony is The End and Glory of my Servitude. Or. In that belief Mundolo, I intend T'impart the secret of my Love to thee. Mu. It is the gen'ral Subject of each tongue, Which now prepare to publish through the world Their vows to your obedience, as joyn'd To him extracts a Soveraigne Right from that Of our Protection. Or. The vulgar voice is a meer bable grown, Which reacheth but to the first appearance Of things to involve the world in Errour; In which, Mundolo, thou art also faln, If thy words truly figure thy Belief. The Object of my Love the Subject is Of our last difference, which thy sense finds Not out because it not distinguisheth. Mu. Means your Honour the youth you spake of last? Or. The same. Mu. The grounds of Love in their dependencies Are imperceptible even to them That suffer the Effects to which it may Become the meanness of my Condition To be an Instrument, no Counsellour. Or. I do approve thy modesty, and will So far make use thereof. Mu. My obedience waits on your Direction. Or. Which is at present but to find the means I may have private Conference with him. Mu. The occasions fair, he being now without Viewing intentively those Pictures sent From Rome. I'le use some slight unwittingly May guide him hither. Or. Do, make tryall of your Art. Ex Mundolo How Imperious is the force of Love! What are these glorious trophies which the world Admire in their Captivity, since they Waves her hand with a slighting gesture to her face.

Seems surprised, seems to retyre. Hah! this fellow hath abused me, Your Honours Pardon. Or. If your Intention guide you hither, Sir, Here is no object will oppose your course. Fi. It was but errour Madam, which Were multiplyed in the continuance. Or. The Errour lyes but in your own dislike, Nor wants but your own satisfaction To repair it. Fi. It is your bounty, so to censure it, Extended it no farther, he deserv'd To bear his guilt that would not clear it so, Or. If farther, 'tis in your own conjecture Meerly, not in mine. Fi. It is against the Rule of civill tyes, To use their faculty to overthrow Their Rites. Or. Those truly are superfluous ceremonies, Which custom hath induc'd to blind the world, Shee might those freedoms steal, Nature hath seal'd To us, ev'n in our first Production. Fi. Without some order were no decency. Or. Order is but a sluggish method form'd To shrow'd the subtilty of the Cautelous. Fi. The Nature of my errour to confirm, If I desist not, will beget another. In this your opposition Madam Or. It is but musicall in our discourse, Not reaching to th'aversion of our wils. Fi. Your Honours is so pow'rful, it must find Concurrence ev'ry where in all that have The Lights of Nature free. Or. To which I doubt your own will scarce agree. Fi. The fault is then in my Capacity Or. Who moves anothers, may thereto conform His own. Fi. It must be when th'Effects of both are known. Or. Where the Cause is infallible th'effects Are manifest: which thus is farther prov'd, Fire must burn, and Beauty must be lov'd. Fi. When they do meet fit Subjects to receive Those their Impressions. Or. Not yet; this difficulty hath too much Art To be simplicity I must be plain. To her self What defect can you finde in me not to Receive the latter? Fi. In Excellence your own Supremacy. Or. That in th'effects against your own is found An Impropriety: since mine in vaine Inviteth: yours with successe enforceth Love. Fi. This onely is in supposition, Not in evidence Or. That to each sense appears which not dverts It self from this oreflowing Passion Of my heart: by a disguis'd neglect. Those blushe yeeld a lustre yet untaught To her self By Art: which though they seem t'oppose with blame My loves accesse; they cherish still the flame. An Attendant Att. Sir, my Lord Ambigamor desires to speak with you. Fi. I'me happily delivered: To himself. I'was ev'n at my last evasion Your Pardon, Madam. Or. Mine submits to your will, ev'n so, who Love, Not by their own, but by anothers move. Exit Or. Scene 2. Filathes. Women in their own Nature gen'rally Deceitfull are. 'Tis the defensive Arm Of their security, fram'd to supply The deffect of their own Ability. But when this innate disposition meets With a fit instrument of wit: 'tis then Women outstrip the common reach of men. The justest ground of my suspition, is This sudden change, so long pursued in vain. My Signet perfectly agrees with this, The Letter. And may without a blemish it reclose. Sits down at a table. Opens the Letter and reads. My Lord Ambigamor. The Messenger hereof delivers you A false pretence, but to delude the hand Directs it, with th'assistance of my Brother, A passionate Party in your Int'rests: I thus advise you to restore your Friend. The Princess (since her intercepted flight, Occasion'd onely by Ludasters Love. For whose Reapeal she often mov'd in vain) Intends the Evening that succeeds this date, To meet him at the Forest holy Oake: Disguis'd alone, arm'd with the assurance Of his vertue: Friendship confirms you best Know how to yeeld him this Intelligence; With which to joyn, your diligence to move; Receive a farer title to my Love. Zizania These are new mysteries, whose progress would Prove fatall to us in their Consequence. Sister, you are a trusty Advocate Is then Ludasters Interests become More prevalent with you, than mine? I must Suppress the issue, though with grief my Friend Ambigamor must be depriv'd thereby Th'advantage which it brings unto his Hopes: Lost in his Mistress scornâThere is a mean pause May favour his and farther yet my Ends. To thy Example be propitious Jove! Ayde my deceit in LoveâIt shall be so. pause With little Art I may protract the Date Hereof, whereon depends their meeting: whil'st I, in the Intr'm, at the appointed time, Vayl'd with th'approach of Night, may personate My Rivall with success: I'le fetch a Pen, And alter it, with ease, it shall not be Distinguisht by the Eye that framed it. Exit Fi. Leaving the letter on the Table. Sinevero Ent. Sin. Filathes! gone so suddenly; he was Intermission reads the letter left on the table. But now they told me in his ClosetâHow! What this? with the assistance of my Brother. A passionate party in your Interestsâ Ludaster at the Forest Holy Oakeâ The Evening that ensues this dateâ Lets fall the letter from his eye that is To Night. Must then my children conspire Against my safety, and th'immediate means I have contrived to enlarge their Fates? Tis time I should provide another stock, To graft a more obedient Issue on. Flings the letter carelesly on the Table again. I'le not oppose their course, their ways shall be Their Snare: my care rests onely on my own Security: which to ensure, and these My doubts confirm with farther certainty, I must set Spies on the Delivery. Ex. Sin. Filathes reent with a Pen. looks on the letter. Fi. This unite, if converted into two, Defers the present, till to morrow night. seems to write, closes it and seals it. Tis done most perfectly. I will dispatch The Messenger; then Heav'n put out your light; Loves sense is clearest in the darkest night. Ex. Fi. Scene 4. Orgula, Mundolo. Or. To night, Mundolo, saist thou? M. Madam, this Night Fidelius must depart. Or. What is the Reason of his sudden hast? Mu. Unless a letter lately sent my Lord Ambigamor, my Observation Can suggest no other. Or. Must the malignance of my stars at once Precipitate my Hopes, their rigour yet Had taught me sufferance, if the change had But flatter'd me to a suspence of Doubt, Though it ne're reacht to farther certainty. Mu. Be not so mov'd. A fertile industry Makes easie paths through ev'ry difficulty: Mine, as in Duty bound, presents it self To th'undertaking. Or. Endeavours happy that pretend to be, Must work on Subjects have capacity. Mu. Madam, this falls within that quality, Though your fears lend it other appearance. Were my life free (though far too mean a pledge For your displeasure) it most willingly Should ballance the Event. Or. What can be done on such an Exigent? Mu. His journey may protracted be. Or. Those purposes do many hazards run Are grounded but on Possibilitie. Where is the means? Mu. To that, Occasion is the fairest Minister, Leave to my vigilance the Charge. Or. Thy subtlety I know still equall is To thy Fidelity. And neither shall Return from my Imployment empty. Mu. Your honors bounty is my providence. Or. How fleeting are th'impressions of my minde: Were this successful my distracted thoughts Would in themselves a new division finde. This innate passion of Supremacy, Which the Soul holdeth from the Excellency Of her own Nature; scarce will intermit To her self To the Repugnance of anothers force. Were but the Motions of Ambition trac'd, Each President would shew; ev'n wantonness, (When her Rites were in question) lost the use Of sense: yet were these flames springs of delight, If but one object could them both unite Mu. Madam, your thoughts seem overcast again With trouble: Appease them in assurance Of my trust. Or. Mundelo, thy faith hath ever been, Without reserve, the closet of my brest. To limmit it with a Restriction now, Were to offend thy Intrest, and betray My own: know then Mundolo, I do finde A contradiction in my own desire, And cannot reconcile the difference: One part we have concluded on; th'other Remains without in Expectation Of my last Resolution. Mu. Do's your Honour mean my Lord Protector. Or. I do; He with new violence pursues His Pretences to a sudden Issue. Mu. What obstacle In this can move you to deliberate? Or. Is it not apparently repugnant To my Love; to yeeld my self unto Another End? Mu. To this your fairest way, If I might be Your guide: This youth is of condition mean, And can not meet your wish, without reproach, Which shrouded with anothers title might Be done: custome makes it warrantable. Wealth moves the world, yet is Loves Minister: First we contract with this, then joyn with that. Husbands are us'd, as Properties in Scenes, To keep the inward motions undiscover'd. Or. We 'gainst our Reason easily conclude When oversway'd by sense: Admit this were To her self As you would figure it. It must distaste A Virgin to yeeld up the passion Of her first Embraces, from him she loves Deservedly, to Age and Impotence. Mu. Nor that, nor this, if you relie on me; That Brain is shallow, which is onely led By common consequence, wisdom creates New means, where none to sense was visible; And fashions subjects were irregular Directly to her Purposes. Or. Such is the force of wisdome, I must grant; But not as plac'd in our Humanity. Mu. Distrust is onely our Infirmity: Our faculties oft fail us in their use, Wanting assurance to support their strength: Yet to confirm your thoughts, I will disclose The manner: My Father was an Artist, Madam, honoured in his time, though since, The ignorance of every mounting Jack, Hath made the Function infamous. Of his I have a Lodanum, so rarely mixt, One scruple giv'n in any liquid thing, Holds with so dull a vapour ev'ry sense, No force can wake them from its violence, Till the course of the Operation pass. This but infus'd upon your wedding night Into his Cup you seemingly do yeeld, The more agreeing Object I will bring Unto your Bed. Or. How bold are servile mindes, To her self. Upon the least discov'ry of our ills, To tempt us unto greaterâI obey: âIntermission. Love and Ambition must work any way. Mundolo, to warrant thy endeavours, The Law allows me power of thy life; To gratifie them, if successfull, I Will raise thy Bondage 'bove thy Liberty. Mu. I finde it so already, Madam, Or. It shall have larger proofs; I'th' interim, Give the direction to your own advice. Mu. Your honour then should suddenly conclude Your Marriage with Sinevero: which done, The rest lies in my execution. Or. Follow thy course; be to thy self thy Fate, Procure me Love; or to thy self my Hate. Ex. Orgula Mu. The true Reward of forward Servitude, I have too farr proceeded to look back: My safety now must be the nighest end. Ambigamor, Fidelius, Ent. Mu. Hah! so nigh! withdraws behind the hanging Amb. I must lye close for new discovery. Amb. This to thy Master give with diligence; Tell him the time and place inscribed shall gives Fi. two letters. Present me to his succour: to which add My Love.

So Dull, The image scarce can be distinguished. From what it represents. Ver. No violence can move a sense of life, More than he breaths. Or. Tis strange, perhaps some lassitude of spirit. See, yee disturb him not. Am. A Trumpet or a Cannon will not do't. Or. It works, Mundolo, vanisht are my fears. Mu. Your honour will have firmer confidence In my Proceedings. To Mun. privately to whisper. Or. I shall, and truly value them: The waiting women one to the other Ver. We shall not need, Amasia to steal Away the Bride to Night. Am. Nor she, Vergona, to protract the loss Of her Virginity with pretended Vows. Ver. Twill save her Artificiall modesty From such constraint. Am.

Mundolo, now My joys have freedome to declare themselves, And yeeld to thee their due acknowledgement. A double vigour animates my sense: The flames of Love I finde more active prove, When they approach their sphear, onely to thee Lays her hand on Mun. Their union must their mediation owe. How fortunes malice labours to suppresse The light of Nature; her beauties casting In obscurity: had they but agreed In thy Production, thy wit had rais'd A glorious title to thy memory. Mu. Yet to your Honours Testimony far Inferiour. Or. I shall finde means to lend it Action Worthy thy capacity: I'th' interim, Proceed to perfect my intention, Occasions ripe, and time doth speedy grow, Yet in his flight, to answer Love, too slow. Mu. My diligence with like alacrity Shall meet them both. Exit Mun. Or. Contract thy dullest vapour gloomy night, Thou fully may'st thy right anticipate: Vaile every gaudy spangle of thy Robe, Thy Beautie lies in thy obscurity. With thy deep Lethargie charm ev'ry sense, No Spye may intercept Loves Privacie. Throughout thy silent Region, no breath move, May once divert the Fancie of our Love. And when thou must withdraw, least us thou should'st Betray; precipitate not thy Course; but slide By degrees away. Scene 3. Zizania. in a Foresters disguise. What Law, so tyrranous, doth us enjoyn With the first Rites of Nature to dispence? Our common preservation should prevaile, Ballanc'd against all other consequence. Yet I unhappy must such ties inflict Upon my self, as no Law would impose, To save another, I my self must lose This goodly light, whereof we so much boast, Serves but to us our thraldome to install: No sooner we do Reasons use attain, But what, who want her, do with liberty; Her strict prescriptions do to us deny. Madam, where is your Highnesse? Eumena Ent. disguis'd in a Foresters habit. Eu. Here, Zizania, here. Ziz. I fearfull am to lose you; this distance Will too much endanger our division. You seem not forward in your own desires; What makes you slack your preintended speed? If fear; Love hath his resolution lost: If lassitude; repose your self on me. Eu. Neither: Zizania. I stay'd to gather somewhat I let fall. Ziz. By your long silence, Madam, I should judge, Your thoughts do suffer some distraction. This your escape would else be some degree Unto your satisfaction. Eu. Which is not figur'd soly in discourse, Such entertainments now would onely serve But to diclose what our disguize conceals. Ziz. Here are no witnesses, believe, but such, Whose simple Nature can distinguish nought We utter: or, if they did, the freedome which They happily enjoy, would not betray Our Liberty. Eu. Are we yet far remote from whence we came, Or whether we intend? Ziz. From both past all distinguishing. Eu. Thou hast so many winding turnings trod, I fear our unknown course should backward lead. Ziz. This path doth guide us to a little Plain, Would perfectly to either us direct. Eu. From which I gather what I have to shun, to her self Zizania, hark, I hear some noise at hand; Step thou before and make discovery. Ziz. Twas but your Highness apprehension. Eu. Think'st thou my fears so vain to agitate Beyond the true direction of my sense. Ziz. Your satisfaction moves my diligence. Eu. I have at length attempted with success, Who by one Party twice betray'd will be, The Author is of his own mysery, Had but my thoughts reflected at the first On the extraction of this infamous Betrayer of my trust; I had not now Been forced to expose my wandring steps To the uncertain chance of Night; nor yet The fury of each savage Beast. Nature In the firm Rule of her Productions would Have taught me, she, according to each kinde, Doth seldome fail in figuring of the minde. The Fathers high Ambition I have found, Which travels indirectly to supplant Me of my Right: whose Pow'r to oresway, Both Love and Wisdome traceth out one way Ex. Eu. Ziz. Twas but the Image of your jealousie. Ziz re-ent. Madam! Madam! I am not surely come Unto the Place I left her in. Heav'n guide My course aright, night may not us divide. Ex. Ziza. Scene 4. Voracho, Spuratro. Encounter. Spu. Voracho! Vo. Spuratro! Spu. What booties are abroad? Vo. I rounded have the Forest; but can finde Naught worth the undertaking. Spu. Hast thou seen any? I am honest grown For want of practice; Thieves, like misers, should Seek for great gains, but not neglect the small. Vo. Two Forresters I oft accosted have, Who by their course seem but to lodge some Dear. Spu. No matter what: Are their cloths good they wear: Vo. Give ear a while; I hear some one draw nigh. Spu. A certain prize, close to our Ambush ply. They hide themselves. Eumena ent. Eu. I have outstript the accents of her voice, And should by her expressions have escap'd The hazard of encounter or pursuit. But whether my Intention should direct, If my sense could distinguish where I am, Is not yet form'd in Resolution: Fear hath till now usurpt that faculty, And happily conducted nature so, As the next means to preservation. Difficulty is sooner overcome, Than treachery: Thus this evasion past, I should proceed to free me from the next: But in this obscure Labyrinth I finde The more to disingage me I insist, The more in errour I my self involve. These unfrequented shades, approaching night, My senses seise with horrour, captivate My fight: benum'd with lassitude my limbs Forget their use: yet when to me the cause Presents it self, Love sweetens ev'ry clause. Oh! cruell Villain! shout, Eu. falls. Spu. Twas well directed, sirrah! he is fall'n. Uo. Quickly advance, and finish him, Ile wait The Coast. Eu. What seek you of me? if my life, It is already to your hand betray'd; A thing so vain, they would not it defend, Had tryed the evils hath attended mine. Spu. So willing to depart? had we but known Your minde, you longer might have liv'd, we seek Anothers life, but to secure our own. Spu. goes about to rifle him: whistles. Tis money is our End. Gratianus Ent. Spu. withdraws. Gra. The cry I heard upon the shot, was here, If my sense err not: hah! a handsome youth Lyes weltring in his blood: what art thou? speak. Eu. I shall not be, while I can let you know, Without the help of charitable hands. Gra. raises Eu. Gra. To your first succour, Sir, accept of mine. So, so, gently rest hardly on me. Why gaze you still with terrour round about? Eu. Least my unhappy suffrings should betray Your charity to the hands, by which I fell. Gra. What were the Villains? Eu. By their intension, I should judg them thieves Gra. Take courage sir, I have at hand more ayd, If need require, which wait but on my Call. Your wound, I do perceive, not mortall is, Yet least your travell, and th'ensuing cold Of Night should farther hazard it, I will Conduct you to a holy man, resides Not far from hence, whose Piety and skill Shall to your succour certain safety bring. Eu. Your goodness sir, hath taught me to believe The gods, as yet, have not abandon'd me. Nor shall my gratitude be wanting to Their Providence, or your humanity. Gra. Mine, if successfull, hath his recompence. Strain not your self, but rest upon my arm. Eu. Heav'n many times to good doth turn our Harm. Ex. Scene 5. Ludaster. Man in himself should a new Nature form To entertain himself without dislike, Or lassitude: so many breaches hath Our frailty to repair, no sooner we Step to supply the one, but suddenly Another calls us to their succour, leaving The vain industry of man both fruitlesse And unsatisfied: such is the burden Of my anxious thoughts, which on their own Reflection vainly toyle to raise their own Perfection, whose incapacity Resists the Pow'r ev'n of Divinity: And by conversion, in the passive sense, Doth seem to limmit that omnipotence. Gratianus, Eumena Ent. Gra. Whilst there is change in things, though from the world She hide her self, vertue will be found out To make her being usefull unto others, And in despite of her repugnant malice, Fortune at length is forced to become Her Minister: See here the Exemplar Presents it self to yours. Lu. How? wounded? Your Stars good, sir, too meanly have, I fear, Directed you, those tender years, I judge, Will prove unapt to meet th'inconvenience Of this sterrile place: But if such defects May be supplyed by my Industry; Expect an issue equall to your Hopes. Eu. Goodness hath surely quite abandoned The sources of Civility. And now, Retracting back to the Original Of her first Reformation, hath forsook The affluence of society, in this Wilde Desart to take up her being. Next under Heav'n, to your Humanities I owe my second being: may the Gods Afford success to lend me gratitude. Lu. Exchange of words will but exasperate Your grief, which rest perhaps may mitigate, Conduct him gently in They lead him in. Lu. Gra. return after a little intermission. Lu. So, Gratianus, the Remedy applyed Twill not be now impertinent to ask, What this youth is? or by what accident Thus wounded? Gra. More than the unaffected grace appears In his demeanour, language and Aspect, As certain marks of his Nobility, I nothing farther can instructed be; As through the Forest hither I was bent, I from the hands of theeves delivered him. Lu. An action becoming well your vertue. Gra. Yet seeks to be, made good in yours. Lu. The gods propitious prove to both our works. But what new change abroad? Gratianus. Gra. Nuptials, sir, which must solemniz'd be In Funerals; the Fox this night is wed To Orgula the Proud, and harbour takes Where he, of late, hath made the Rape of all Our Hopes, in our fair Soveraign.

You inverst Eyes of Night, Who on our easie Nature work our Fates, Concur in your auspitious Ministry To crown a flame, As bright and lasting as your Essences: Attract some vapour, that your light may be Doubtfull to us, as your uncertainty.

Force not, or force permit; if that thy Eye Be onely placed in the phantasie; My fear and thy Restraint are void. This shade Translates me to the Image of her thoughts, Where high consent shall meet in equall Fires, And when the guilty blushes of the Morn, Hasten'd by hers, betray the fallacy, Her prepossessed fancy will reflect, Upon the first Impression of delight, Which will her ravisht senses so suspend, They will not find or not dislike th'Errour: While strugling Honour, finding not a Name To stile the Act, is forced to assume Those Rites may yeeld it priviledge.

Work onâChance is a weak foundationâ Yet doth the light of Nature captivate, And by co-herence of her links drags on The worlds important Agitation: While ev'ry new occurrent she, but forms Supplants the Fabrique of Resolution, And in a Minute scatters what Reason Hath many Ages toiled to erect. Chance past, since not sought, not attaints my will: Succeeding blames not, if the same fulfill. Assenting Love sayes force I can not suffer: And passive Nature force I cannot act: Without impulsion guilt is not in fact: Yet if so far chance reach not, or their leave, She others may, but shall not me deceive. Hope is abandon'd: what chance hath begun, I leave the sequell by her to be done. Ex. Ziz. Nefarius and a band of Villains. Ne. Fate is our handmaid, th'are met neer to part.

Fidelius seems strook with wonder after some intermission. A SONG Repugnant Powers long have sway'd My will, obscurely clos'd; What Love design'd Honour gainsay'd; What Honour, Love oppos'd. Neither prevayling, now agree, Love lies disarm'd; And Honour charm'd By his affected Cer'mony. Wait all you Graces, happy How'rs! To crown approaching joy; And all your sense-refining Powers, To fill delight, Imploy! At once let each sense captive be, Vicissitude May not intrude Envy to eithers Ministry. Fi. What means the flatt'ries of this gaudy Scene? Mu. The charming preludes to a glorious Love. Fi. My years reach not to the capacity, Or to distinguish, or to relish them: Mu. Our facile natures easily receive The Elements of that Philosophy, Which in our pleasure plac'd the chiefest good. Fi. If grounded o'th sense: A false position, The which another Sect abandons quite. Mu. A rigid, Tenent, nature would distort From her first purity her Functions Making uselesse. Fi. I question neither, since neither approve; But sure I am, so high a subject can Not settle on the base of an extream. Mu. Nor doubt of that which is in evidence. Let others search for that, which you, enjoy. These Arguments admit no solÅcisme shews him the banquet To cheat the sense. Their excellence perswades And satisfies: See here how splendid Lux Hath rifled Natures Treasury, Not onely to restore, but to exalt Her faculties; which when dispenced, shall Replenisht, flow from inexhausted Springs. See how th'industrious hand of wanton Art, Contracted hath, in this smal Epitom, The scatter'd peices o'th worlds perfections. These Virgin Spangles guild Nights sable robe, Whilest from their Orbs we hear Exclusive Harmony; not judging where. Here Aromatique odours which perspire In their immortall Essences. If yet Thy years extend to be Opinion sick. Shews him a Cabinet of jewels and gold. See, what beauty, use or difficulty Hath made pretious in esteem: Here find none, If honoured not in yours, to whom they are Presented. Yet on these trifles, why should I insist? Since she, to whom these glories hommage owe, Is yours. She'fore whom their beauties vanish, As things too mean to entertain the sense. She adds fresh lustre to th'exalted Day, The Object of all vows; of all desires, Who moves more sprightly influence in her grace, Than all those Dames Antiquity recites To have made captive the worlds Conquerors. Yet she, with equall spoils invested, is Become your Captive, Sir, why suffer you Those your distracted looks to speak repulse In trouble. Those years and beauty promise A more relenting Nature: To whose Rites, If inclination will not yeeld: Be wise, Comply, and to your fortunes minister. Fi. Mine are already framed to my wish, And find lesse agitation in their seat, Though humble, shelter'd by anothers care, Than if more high, erected by my own: Nor can you Nature blame, she answers not To what her immaturity withholds. Mu. Art hastens that we see in fruits and flowers: Nor will this all-informing light of Love Act less when you approach her Orb. Advise, And be more flexible; let not your will Transport your Reason to a stubornness. If the enlargement of your Fate move not; Yeeld to secure your present safety Sir, Fi. starts Start not: I now speak but the resentments Of another, not my own: yet figure To your self the Rage of Love neglected, High in Expectation, as desire, Met in a Subject, high in her own esteem, And others; whose power, for an offence, Hath no bounds, but her will to act vengeance. Fi. Though high discourses in me cannot frame A Resolution to remove my Fears, The Office is supply'd by Innocence, And I, immoved, must the issue wait. Mu. Nay, then I beat the ayre; and cast away, That time grows ripe to hasten my own ruineâ pause Mu. Awake dull temper! can'st thou only act For others Interests, and not for thy own?â pause Rise high you struggling spirits, and cast off The servile badges of this supprest mind, Fear and respect, with this their Livery. casts off his cloak I have let in a flame, wilde as the worlds Embracement, when that proud Boy miscarried In his Rule: And must pursue it, though it Meet his Fate: Who falls in attempts are high, Into Org. bedchamber. Erects his Fame unto Eternity. Ex. Mu. Fi. How strange a labyrinth am I involved in! So full of errour, Hope cannot figure An Evasion: Why sport you so, you Pow'rs That guide our Fates, with our Infirmities? If they offend, it is enough that you Abandon them, to work their punishment. My being so inconsiderable is, Imagination could not once suggest So weighty a dependance, as might move For preservation; were it not engag'd In his peculiar interests: who doth, In his onely bosome, vertue preserve Alive in her unblemisht purity. May be, these new disorders you produce, By farther opposition, yet to make This his admired life more glorious: And shewing how far one mans strength may reach, From others all excuses take away Of humane frailty; Give me leave to say Tis already at this height so penible, The soon reputed will is easily Induc'd to think't past imitation: Or if it yet want proof, 'tis in that part, Might shew undoubted Moderation, Not his Constancy. Afford it matter; Raise him to that height of Felicity, Wants onely durance but to equall yours; Twill neither prove miscognisant to you; To others insupportable; nor yet Unto Himself obnoxious. For this, My prayers shall never want or fervency, Or perseverance to become successfull. Mundolo re-ent. unbutton'd in a loose posture. Mu. In this circumference of our Lives, I see, Extreams meet in one point; delight will force A breach to let out life, as well as grief; to himself In which swelling excesse, but now, I felt My Soul ev'n floating o're these shallow banks. Hah! 'tis with'n; hence sear; my Fate is full, noise, looks behind Mu. stinks behinde the hanging, while Org. enters in a night Robe, and dressing amorously accosting Fid.

Which offer'd is with so much Ardency, As it enricht the greedy tenderer. Why shifts those Scenes of Beauty in thy Face? Unlesse to take with new variety: Let no motion raise, or retract thy bood, Unlesse it be the Passion of thy Love. Why so much distance, where Loves mysteries Fi. seems to withdraw from her Already frame an union? Let our souls Meet in their faculties, as their Organs have In theirs: Hang not thy head down like a flower Drooping for a timely show'r.

And is not that enough to stile it just, Confirm'd by my Election? Fi. A fraile one 'tis, which will not hold the tryall. Or. Thou art not so inconstant sure, art thou?

But my sollicitous Passion will admit No Object, but her own; or if it do, Tis but as a predominant quality All differing humours doth convert into Their proper Aliment: oft it o're flows To such distemper, that my Pious host Seems to discover, in his suffering, A civill notice of't, which flatters so My sense; I often prompted am to poure The Rest in his religious bosome. And crave thereto his farther charity. Which see, how vigilant o're my safety still! Ludaster ent. Lu. Too long emotion yet brings accident By inflammation or debility. Retire your self, good Sir, to your repose; On happy nature you too much presume. Eu. Unto your charity and skill her bounty And my errour Sir, do their beings ow, The one restor'd encouraged th'other. Lu. I joy to finde such symptoms of success, Which must be cherisht in their Infancy, Till time confirm their issues evident. Besides, excuse o're busie observation, If it judge, this lonelinesse may foment Your mindes distemper to the prejudice Of your recovery, be not abash't; My rudenesse doth affirm I have disclos'd. What those blushes assure, they would have hid. A reverent fear intrusion shall restrain From a more nigh distinction. Eu. So indiscreet a jealousie, in me, Might question my integrity and yours, The former I assure you, onely can Be impeacht of Natures Infirmities, Which I presume the latter hath convinc'd, And challenge rather might the overture Of mine, but for their safe direction. Lu. Yours are not so remote from that instinct Conducteth them in their first purity, To want so fraile a Ministry as his, Whose more corrupting years hath given o're To the digression of a froward will. Eu. Which is to such conformity reduc'd By an industrious prudence, that in you, Vertue is now become a proper Habit, Which in our undiscerning youth remains A fleeting accident. Lu. I rather will assume this vanity The Errour to confute of your belief, Then farther to extend this Argument To the hazard of your present welfare, By too much thus effusing of your spirits, Which for their Restitution must exact Your rest. Eu. Of your judgement I've proofes too sensible, To question your prescriptions. I obey. ex. Eu. Ludaster conducts Eu. in. Lu. returns. Lu. So excellent a temper in a minde So young, I have not found; nor yet opprest With so much Anxiety; which he endears With so severe a privacy, as if He on his trouble were enamored. But time must be his better medicine. Day waxeth old Trouble hath seis'd my thought, I've from Gratianus no intelligence: I fear his unrestrained courage should Too high tempt danger to his overthrow. Fi. en. Fidelius! Welcome. Embraces him. Sweet reconciler of distractions! Of Gratianus hast thou nothing learn'd. Fi. Let not th'inquiry of his safety Sr Leave yours in hazard with the circumstance. He is secure. This lettr, Sr, ere this, gives him a let. Should have been guided to your hand by me, But my unhappy Starres have in my course Made frustrate my Endeavours. Lu. Thy safety shall excuse their opposition. Fi. Nor judge the freedome you have us'd me to, So insolent as to forerun your hand In the unclosure, 'twas a violence My life escaped narrowly. Lu. What need'st thou plead thy innocence, as I Had any secret were not safe in thee, Or from thee would not learn, if yet unknown. Returns the letter. Thy lips shall give it evidence; Read out. Let. read by Fi. according to the contents of the former only signed Ambigamor. Fi. Sr. Not to blemish with suspect your choice, Nor so farre to presume as to intrude My self your Counsellor. Give duty leave To move your caution in the enterprise. Lu. 'Tis strange. Nay, ev'n incredible. Yet that hand sign'd it yields it certainty. Friend, is a powerful charm 'gainst all distrust, What he adviseth, that pursue I must. Fi. Yet Sr. I must crave one request of you, Since yo' are resolv'd the issue to attempt, This masque of your disguise you would retain; And suffer me but to become your scout, While you at distance follow, that thereby If treachery intended be, you may Secure your person. Lu. Thy Love is Zealous of my safety still. Be it my guide. Who steareth by such light Shall find no errour ith' obscurest night. ex. Lu. Fi. Eu. re-ent. Eu. If my sense well distinguish, I o're heard Them name the Princess. I'le follow unseen: That I my self my own affairs may know. Who's lost t'her self needs fear no overthrow. ex. Eu. Scene 5. Ambigamor ent. This is th'appointed place, and this the Hour. Groaning heard within. What doleful groan lends horror to a night Whose flatt'ring calmness but inviteth love. Again, 'twill scarce be charity to wait Groaning again. Another Summon; yet stay Her Order Draws his sword Wills us first our selves secure. 'Tis this way The voice directethâ Intermission. Withdrawing a while returns drawing as it were to the light, the body of Zizania. Thou glorious Plannet lends lustre to the rest! Revert th'expansion of thy beams a while; Sense may distinguish what but sense suspends, The inarticulate accents of these groans Awake a terrour without evidence. What art thou? speak, or who this fact hath wrought? Ziz. Oh! Ludaster! In a languishing tone. Kneeling on his knee bends her forward in raising her. Am. Zizania! confirm my sense again, My tortur'd soul may with thee take her flight. Speak yet again; art thous Zizania, My lov'd Zizania? Ziz. Zizania raiseth himself destractedly. Am. That very sound's enough t'extinguish life, By preying on my languishing spirits, Had love a temper to spin out my Fate. Why trifle I with passion to unman My self; and let shame with distraction play. Resolution is but cheated by delayâ Offers to kill himself. Holdâ pause. Due Rights must first be tender'd to her Ghost, Puts up his sword and kneels to raise and bow her as before. Whom I shall fear to meet yet unreveng'd. Pardon! thou Innocent Object of my vows, If I disturb thy rest, yet once again, To lend direction to just sacrifice, My Honour, Love, and Vows have me engaged, To offer to thy horrid sufferings. Speak, and declare the barbrous instrument. Ziz. Oh! Bends her and chases her temples. Am. Lend so much vigour to her spirits yet, You higher Powers! as may mark out your justice. Speak, oh speak. Who wast that wrought this bloody cruelty? Ziz. OhâLudaster! Am. Forbid it Heav'n! and be my safer guide! Confirm't again; who was thy Murderer? Speak! Ziz. Oh! Ludaster. Am. Why mock you thus our frailty with a Name Would charme a dying Testimony? Yet lend it but the next assertion, And I pursue the tenor of my vows Without a scruple to relation. Speak who thus hath spilt thy guiltless blood, speak. Ziz. Oh! Ludaster. Straining her forward. Am. Enough, farewell my souls delight! my stay Shall make our meeting more agreeable, Kisses her. And thou Religious union of my soul, Like a declining shadow vanish hence; Nor leave behind the least Impression, Since that light is extinguisht formed thee. Mundolo ent. mufled. Spying Mu. withdraws. Hah! more spies abroad still roving; I must Obscure my self for new discoveries. Mu. Precipitate thy course dull Night! take on Thy deepest tinctures: Such, as when with spels The Canting Hagg frights nature from her seat To masque the tracts of Mischief and confound The world in errour. oh! how much should ow Th'inferiour Kingdome to thy Ministry. Were fear but an Authentike Evidence To truth. The worlds Philosophy stiles Ill, What they would shun to suffer, not what they Shun to act: Which practice makes good, where they Are no relatives. Oh! th'abusive world! Whose well known Mysteries instruct my sense, That ills are none which want their Evidence. Fancy works high o'th Object of delight, Yet let not joy elate the spirits; least Thus rarified, they should effuse themselves Before they reach to Action. Hah! who's this? Fidelius ent. If doubtful light may yeeld a Certainty, This is the Stripling that escap'd my fury, Whose bosom only can disclose the deed I have already done; or yet pervert What I intend to act; this both secures. stabs him. Fi. Oh! oh! cruell villain! Falls to the ground. Ludaster ent. Wounds Mu. who falls being hurt in the arm, the dagger drops from him. Lu. So swift be justice in thy punishment, And in the progress lasting, till it meet A measure equal unto thy desert. Hadst thou of man so little left in thee, To violate such tender innocence. Speak, what art thou? or why this mischief wrought? Is insolence swell'd up to stubbornness In thy mouth, and daring in thine eyes? Speak. That little life thou hast shall be reserv'd, binds and ties him to a tree with his girdle. To make exemplar farther sufferings.â Now my Fidelius what hopes of safety? Fi. Little where yours is yet in hazard Sr. Lu. 'Tis but the figure of thy jealousie. kneels &amp; raises Fi. Fi. Withdraw good Sr, and timely yet provide For your security. Lu. Thou would'st not have me yet more infamous? Thus to involve thee in an accident, Speaks nothing louder than my own dishonour, And to abandon thee in this extream. Fi. Your presence Sr, may prejudice your being Mine not support; past the capacity Of succour. Lu. Heav'n is more gracious to my misery. Nor let the fear of me suggest thy ills To be more great than thou conceivest them. Humanity enjoynes us ne're to leave The means so long as there is motive to't. Try if thy strength will suffer thee to be Transported. So, gently. raises him. Fi. Oh! I faint; My soul is sliding from her mansion. Sets him gently on the earth again. Restore me to the earth: Thither I must, Our frail Original: where set, I may Spin out but so much breath as may remove Doubt and dishonour from my memory.â pause. Will you remember me when I am dead? Lu. Else must forget my self. Fi. 'Twere needful thereto that you knew me first. Lu. Know thee! why so I do. I know thou art Fidelius. My faithful lov'd Fidelius. Fi. I would not rob you of his memory, Who gave me access to your knowledge Sr, Yet pardon me if I must say you erre. Lu. Erre! in what my sweet Fidelius? Fi. When you affirm me him you name. Lu. Why, art thou not? Fi. No. Although our souls had but one motion, Our bodies still held their distinction He died when he departed from you sick; With so much passion to your vertue Sr, That I became transported with th'admir'd Idea, and took the advantage which Nature had lent me in similitude, I might succeed to his relation. Yet with a flame so pure did never reach To the distinction of my hidden Sex; Which was the only difference made us known Unto the womb that bore us. Lu. Wonder hath captiv'd ev'ry faculty, To the detention of their offices; And but suspends a grief will soon or'eflow Her shallow Continent, to pay the Rights To double Interests: Yet say how must They be distinguished. Fi. Fidelia, twin'd sister to Fidelius. Lu. As if nature had but one only frame And Constellation, to produce so rare And exact a moddell. Fi. Oh! Lu. Courage! thou miracle of Nature. Fi. Oh! the cloud of death hangs o're my senses, And steals away my Spirits; yet I dy Content, in the belief I have receiv'd The fatal stroak directed unto you. Lend me your hand thereon my vows to seal. Be all united here, which man calls weal. Kissing his hand and languishingly uttering his last words dies. Lu. They are divorc'd, fairwell the loveliest pair, That ever made one happy union! Kisses her cheek. Accept this offering to your vertuous loves weeps. Though too too mean, Yet strugling nature nere could force them forth The tainted source of proper interest. Ambigamor discouers. Amb. If yet in thy exterior part thou hast Thy self but truly figur'd unto me, That habit and this place speak thee Ludaster. Lu. Ambigamor! Thou welcome balsome to my wounded soul! Open thine Arms that I may slide into Thy bosom, where mutual imbraces may Translate our Members to an union. Lu. running to imbrace him, Amb. puts him by with his hand. Amb. Forbear. Lu. What new disorder hath disguis'd thy love In this sullen Austerity? Amb. Such as that name of Friend thus casteth off, Like a despised trifle, and bids the Waves his hand &amp; draws his sword. To be such unto thy proper safety. Lu. How strangely art thou wandred from thy self! Collect thy thoughts to a becoming temper. stands amaz'd. Amb. Play not with Rage. Be sudden in defence, I east my distraction this proceeding judge More grace than thy guilt deserves. Lu. Let me first know the nature of my crime? Amb. Persevere not herein. Ask me not why. Who knows ills t'act, knows how them to deny. Lu. I shall suspect the Base whereon I rais'd That holy Title keeps my hand in Aw; If thou insistest thus. Amb. No more those vain illusions, Draw. Lu. I will not, do thy worst, since thy folly Hath cast away the last thing I held dear: Chance hath left nought for chance to work upon. Amb. Tempt not thy Ruine, from which this hand restrains, But to take off the blemish of the manner. Lu. Hold! Casts off his disguise. Perhaps the cloud of this disguise resists The influence of our Amity. Vainly He's hid from others, to himself is lost. Doth thy wild sence perceive thy errour yet? Amb. Those were the masques but to conceal thine own. Draw, or the lightning is not swifter than My execution. Lu. Hold! I to my self may prove an Homicide: Who doth betray his being by neglect, Is guilty of his own destruction. What Nature first commands, see, I obey, Draws his sword. What friendship, though contemned, thus I may. Letting the point of his sword fall on the ground. breaks off the point with his foot. Amb. A handsome flourish, but I must not vie, Revenge is not restrain'd by Gallantrie. They fight. Lu. only defends himself. Eumena ent. Lu. Oh! thou hast thy will, he's but half guarded I see, stands only on his own defence. Eu. Hold, I enjoyn by your Allegiance, hold. By all those ties are strictest to your soul, If there rest any unattainted yet to Amb. In this your violence. Amb. It is the Princess voice. Eu. And such her person, though misfortune hath Transfigur'd it in shew as it hath you In truth. Sharper Rebukes I should insist upon; But that my love suspends my Ire a while, Nor shameth it my frailty to assume That Attribute, which may a mind indue Without distemper, by such object form'd: Why shifts those secret signals of thy thoughts to Lu. So oft their Scenes, as they gave place to trouble? Lu. To find a ruder Sov'raign intercept The Rights I ow to that fair Majesty By his untimely tribute. Eu. Speak not my fears in mystery. What hurt? Mine eye may find the proof without reply. Approaches him as 'twere to search. Takes of her scarff to bind his wound, and closes it with her handkerchif. Unhappy conducts of our destinies! Why mock you thus our frailty. Whom I sought You led me to by errour. Whom I had By errour you took from me. Whom I find, By errour unrepar'd, is to me lost For ever. Oh! Erring Ministry! O're which you prudent Powers that preside! Instruct our incapacities, and shew, Why you from man exact ought in his own Direction; since thus subordinate Unto Others Rule, those faculties Intangle in their Exercise, wanting Of the Superiour Clear Intelligence. How find you Nature yet dispos'd in you? Lu leaning on his sword she supports him on t'other side. Lu. Like to an Artificial fire to Heav'n Aspires, whose frail composure being unapt Thereto; by his own violence consum'd, Toucheth his height, and drops to Earth again: Such is the active and aspiring flame Your Grace, and Graces have inspir'd in me, Which meeting in a Subject farre too mean To reach so full proportion of Felicity, Falls from't at Distance through his own defects. Eu. The wide worlds fleeting Glories are too mean. Dignities but to instile thy Attributes, And her vast Theater a receptacle Too narrow to present the Action Of thy Immortal vertues, whose only light If rightly plac'd might free her course from Errour. Lu. Your happy fortunes, and more Glorious Life Will certainly make good all these in yours: While mine rests doubtful in Opinion. Eu. You Powers! of whose most Glorious Essences These fair Ideas we admire, are thought, But the imperfect shadows! if not for ours For your own Interests. If we you concern, Restore your Beauties fairest Continent, Least shallow man too suddenly conclude You have your proper cause abandoned. Or else inform us, why vertue y'have rais'd To vertues overthrow. This valiant hand Had power and cause sufficient to pursue Their Ruine, who his shamefully procur'd. Unhappy wretch! How art thou lost in shame! turns to Ambig. they raise him &amp; set him up.
