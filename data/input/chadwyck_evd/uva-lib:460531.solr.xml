      <field name="fulltext">THE CUP OF WATER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âEarth's young significance is all to learn.â Robert Browning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Almund, a young King. Hubert, Almund's Friend. Reuben, an old Gardener. Cara, a woodland Girl. Millicent, a Princess, betrothed to Almund.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene. A Woodâtwice removed to the Garden of Millicent's Castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. The Wood. Enter Almund and Hubert. Almund. The woods are leafless, but the hazel-twigs Are sprouting; if one hangs one's head aside, 'Tis green against the sky. Our callow spring Is chilly, wild, and petulant so often I am not much surprised to feel this ice Among the pushing buds. Hubert. Surprisedânot you! The even tenour of your disposition Will never own a marvel; while for me There's novelty in every change of day; Faces distract my humour, and the tunes A minstrel strikes up one upon another Ring through my blood and take away my breath With simple fascination. Almund. Yes, dear lad; It is your gaiety and bubbling youth That keep our bond so fresh. Hubert. Oh, I am sure There is no sweeter fervour in the world Than that of early friendship, when it flows From childhood's fount, and two unhindered spirits Shake the same gusty tempests from their brows, Welcome the same soft sun, and face together Each day's new, yet familiar, circumstance. With women it is different; they keep So far apart, and do not care to listen Unless one speak of love. Almund. They choose a theme, The sole to which God deigns to lend an ear. The racking terror one is not beloved Once laid to rest, the deeper aim of speech Attains its goal, and one may give one's tongue To gaiety, as yonder babbling brook, Babbling of nothing. Ah, we reach its source Beside this wretched hut; the moss is trodden Around, the starry spurges of the spring-time Grow gold about it, and the withered leaves Crackle above the runlet. Yonder stoops A maiden with her cup,âand I am thirsty, Although I did not know it. [Enter Cara at a distance.] Hubert. What a frigid And lonely look the little figure has! Almund. A starving daisy!âGirl, you have a cup, And I am thirsty. Will you give me drink? Hubert. Ay, catch this bankside dribble for us, lass. Cara [to Almund]. Yes, sir. [Going to the fountain.] Almund. Oh, Hubert, watch how she is bending, As if her ear were open to some secret Among the mouldered ferns. Hubert. She's lovely, lovely, Provokingly demure. Almund. The cup is full. Hubert [to Cara]. Serve me the first, and I will hand it on. Why do you pause and tremble? Cara. He shall have it. [Pushing past Hubert.] No, no! He asked me. Almund. Gently, child! I'll kiss The edge, and then my friend shall have his draught. Cara. But you shall drink. It is for you. Almund. What, first, When a dear comrade asks? Where were my manners, My charity? Cara. He tried to snatch the cup; He has not drunk, I pulled it from his lips. You said that you were thirsty, and for you I caught the rill. Drink, drink! Hubert. How laughable! Almund. My friend before me! Take the cup to him.â [Aside.] What passion in the hazel eyes! O God, I am betrothed; I know it like a curse That has begun to work. She turns away With piteous submission; as a blast I bend her spirit. Hubert [to Cara, taking the cup]. Bravely offered now, You pretty scold! Why, Almund, there are tears Splashed on her cheekâa tempest in a second. Almund [aside]. To comfort her, enfold her to my heart, And keep her! Hubert. Jove! I ever was esteemed A scoffer at the ladies: this bright wildness Of sudden crying washes off my guilt, And I am all for love.âUp with your apron, And dry your eyes; we only want the water You gathered from the bank. Where do you live? Cara. Close by. Hubert. Within that hovel? Cara. Yes. Hubert. How shortly You answer, such a nipping tongue you have! [Passing the cup to Almund.] Almund. You do not live alone? Cara. Sir, with my father, But quite alone. By day he fells the trees; A great way off I sometimes hear his axe, When I am sitting lonely; and at night He sleeps within his cabin. [Coming up to Almund.] Drink again! Almund [drinking]. All that is left; yet all was meant for me. Cara. Give me the cup. I'll hold it to the stone, And bring it running over. Hubert. What a bound! As freakish as a February lamb's. Cara. Full, full as ever. Almund. I will drain it, child. No passing on,âyou see, the very cupful You meant for me at first, at last I drink, No jot abated. Hubert. You are talking now Above her head. Almund. Her soft look understands. Hubert. I love that gentleman, I am his friend; Will you not turn, and give me but a smile? There's a gay, little woman. Now a kiss! [Snatching one.] How swift a change! Her childhood is all gone; Adorably a girl, she shrinks and flushes The wild-wood red of yonder whortle-blooms. Ah, I have kindled love with just a touch, And stung the bud with light. Oh, joy! Oh, love! Almund. Come, let us go. I will no longer wait; The wind is keen among these boughs. Good-bye. Hubert. Farewell, delicious hermit. [To Almund.] That is cruel! Note her sly modestyâshe waves to you, And only you. It is a lovely method That virgins have of hiding what they hope To turn the other way in all they do. [Almund, unperceived by Hubert, throws a kiss to Cara.] And, hark, that is her little trill, a spirt Of song, the early bird. [Exit Cara.] Almund. She's immature, And like the very month of March,âas tart, Impetuous, provoking. It is sweet When Spring is thought about, and is not here. Hubert. Almund, I love her, love her! You were moved; I saw her charm strike inward. Do not wince; If you are plighted, you are yet too young To have no idle fancies. She is worthy My love, although she is a cottager? Almund. That's nothing; burn up all such circumstance If you would love indeed. To ashes with it! Hubert. How vehement your tone! Almund [abstractedly]. To be beloved Even from the very fountain of the heart, To touch the well-head of a maiden-passion, The bright spring from the rock; in the cool draught To feel the virgin, solitary years, And win access to the deep flow and current Of the dark water-bed among the hills;â It is a miracle one fears to greet, A sign that does not modify events, But re-adjusts the soul. Hubert. You brood on love Too solemnly; it is a simple joy. Almund. I talk at random. How these catkins dust One's velvet! You are happy? Hubert. Oh, I feel That all my merriment of disposition Was but a childish matter; the man's rapture Steadies me and ennobles. Yet I swear She much preferred you till I took that kiss, And all my fervour crept into her face. I must not tease my wayward anchorite, Or she will run to you; that brow of yours Seems to extend protection. Almund [aside]. She is mine. The water came not straighter from the earth, Than she herself to me. Hubert. You are unmindful; I vainly prate to one in reverie,â Indifferent to my fortune. Almund. May you win her! You are my friend. Hubert. I doubt not she will listen; The small, cold cheek grew ruddy. We shall wed, When you espouse your Millicent. Almund [aside]. Thus God Severs, without the clemency of death. [Exeunt.] SCENE II. The Wood, Next day. Enter Hubert. Hubert. How my heart throbs, and how philosophers Would laugh to see me hurry to this inlet Of winding turf amid the rusted leaves; For love, they say, is like the pretty dint In the green pasture that, with use, becomes A beaten, dusty road! Oh, not with her!â She has such moods to follow; she is changeful As this tempestuous morning. What a wreck Of spring's bright sheddings on the ground amid The pine's red autumn-refuse! Broken life! I will not moralize; I'll call her name. What syllables will bring her? She's a darling, Miniature's self, the point of space, yet all I can conceive, all that my heart requires. Is there no means to bring her? Hark! Be quiet, All treble voices of the meagre season; Here's a wild catch a-singing. Oh, the glee! Cara [singing afar]. Where winds abound, And fields are hilly, Shy daffodilly Looks down on the ground. Rose-cones of larch Are just beginning; Tho' oaks are spinning No oak-leaves in March. Spring's at the core, The boughs are sappy. Good to be happy So long, long before! [Running to him.] Where is your friend? Hubert. To-day I come alone. You must not fancy, little maid, that I Am but another's shadow. Let me keep These restless fingers [tries to kiss her]. Ah, it comes again, Your colour of the bilberry's flowering tufts. My kiss is not forgotten? 'Twas to warm Your icy cheek my lips grew pitiful; But when they rested there, and chased the frost, They longed to lead up summer to your face By kissing, ever kissing. Do not look So harshly coy. O little, woodland girl, I'm making love. Cara. I love, I love. I made it As droplets from the great earth filled my cup; I made it yesterday. I love, I love! Hubert. How shrill the passion of this tiny throat! You loved me at first sight; so I loved you, And shall. . . Oh, now I know there is for ever To make room for such loving. Cara. Do you think That he can love like that? Hubert. You mean the king? Cara. No, not the king. My lover is a man Who tells me he is thirsty; I have never Seen anything so noble in my life. He bade me give you drink. He is not proud, He did not make me humble in my heart,â I leapt within. Hubert. Hush, hush! I shall be angry. How dare you speak of loving him? It is A fearful treason. What, a tiny subject,â The least, sure, that he governs,âto presume, As if she were a princess, to call lover Her sovereign lord! There, there! You did not know It was a king who showed you courtesy. Now you will understand. You see those fences,â The flowers that grow inside you never touch. Cara. Oh, yes; I climb the paling for the clumps Of juniper, and for the jay's blue plume, That glitters so with the black bars across: I never heed what's written to forbid; It is all made for me on either side The bit of mossy fencing: that I know. Hubert. Well, you may snatch the flowers; but there are things Quite out of reach, that it is wickedness Even to want. You must be dutiful, And glad to fill your pitcher for the king, When he rides down the forest; but to dream That you could marry him! His mate is chosen In Millicent, a noble lady, honoured By all the people. Do not grow so black Across this forehead,âsuch a withered sadness, Such bleak despair! Cara. Why, you have nearly killed All in my bosom. Hubert. Sit upon these logs, Against my arm, and let me tell you, child, As you have loved in silly ignorance One who could never give the least return, Who dare not, and who would not; I have loved Less madly, but with passion like to yours, You, only you. Cara. I hate her. Hubert. God above! You startled me with that short virulence, Those grinding teeth. Be silent, wicked lass. Cara. Cara would slay her. Hubert. Oh, is that your name? How lovely and enticing; why, the winds Are heart-tied to the sound. Cara, be gentle, Put by this dreary wrath, and let me kiss The loathsome curses from your lips. Come, come, Ripple the mouth to beauty, let these eyes Take on their vanished glances. Cara. He is mine; A thief has hold of him, my own, my own, My king, my love, my love! Hubert. He never was, Never will be your love. This is the nonsense That women, who know nothing of the world, Prate to their narrow souls. The king would laugh To hear you chirp such folly. Cara [springing from Hubert, and standing apart]. It's more wicked Than anything that's done. I know what hurts. I plucked once a big bough of apple-bloom; I wanted it to hold down in my frock, And smell; they said it was too good for me, I should have let the apple-tree alone To be of use in autumn. All my pleasure Was robbed,âthey tried to snatch the bough away; I ran and buried it, for I was glad It should be wet and grimy in the soil. It is so dreadful to make anything That springs up in the heart seem black and wicked; And it is such a lie! The king would laugh? He had a still, grave face; I am quite sure That he would never laugh at anything So terrible and sudden. Why, the oak Has a white, bony bough amid the leaves; That's where the lightning struck. I do not laugh, I think what it must suffer 'neath the green, So scathed and ugly. Hubert. Cara, do not put Such hatred in your eyes; if the great lady Who loves the kingâ Cara. Great ladies cannot love. You must be poor and famished to be hungry; No crust at home, and all the whortles picked Before you reach the commonâthen the tears Come choking. It's when everything is gone! Why should I live? Hubert. O Cara, for his friend. Remember, I am here; and if you love The king, would live for him, you must include His cherished comrade Hubert in affection, For I am half of Almund, and would die To do him service. Cara. Then you are not spiteful? I thought you snatched the cup away to keep My lover thirsty. Hubert. Dearest, but to plague, And daunt your pretty eagerness, that seemed Excessive to a stranger. Cara. But I knew All through me that I loved him. Hubert. See, this cloak, And ring, blood-red, were his. Ah, swiftest kisses Light on these senseless objects. Will you, Cara, Touch what he never cared for, and refuse The least caress to what he holds most dear, His living friend, myself? [She kisses him.] Divine the freshness, The firm assault, the intrepidity Of this short kiss! Until I marry her, 'Twill be a smarting memory. Cara. He loves you, Have you not all you want? Hubert. No; for I long To take you to my arms. Cara. Are you not filled With everything you need? I want and weary Simply because you said he did not love, And could not love me. Hubert. Terrible the tears That cannot gather, but are in the look! Child, will you take this ring he used to wear, And think of me as giving it? Cara. Oh, sir, I'll never lose it. Hubert. Hold the finger out; Now you are my betrothed. Love, are you faint? Cara. I felt it like his grasp, his claim; my body Was frightened with its joy. Hubert [aside]. Only his chiding Can end this strange distraction. On her hand The crimson jewel, like the winkling red Upon the hazel, seems familiar, settled Where it should fitly be.âThink you are mine Now that I leave you lonely. [Going.] Cara. Gentlemanâ Hubert. No, Cara, I am Hubert. Cara. If you meet him, Oh, tell him I am his, a weary child, Tired out since yesterday. [Exit Hubert mournfully.] I'll go along The wood, and say it over to myself, He cannot, cannot love me; but I know Deep in my heart he does. There was a giftâ The king had something for me in his eyes; And when he waved good-bye. . . I am quite sure God made him for me; he will come again. [Exit.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. A Terrace-garden. Enter Almund. Almund. Not all at once! It comes too suddenly To learn one's youth from the sharp cry of love. There was no preparation,âmy whole body Answers that eager girlhood. Love, love, love, Without which we are made of the mere clay Of the world's agÃ¨d floor! Not all at once!â Such news of honour and of joyâto be Chosen of God to add the master-touches To His unfinished work: He gives the lover His coy girl Eve to make a woman of, To warm, to waken. Ah, those changeful eyesâ To fill with love's imperishable light; That cheek to alter,âsuch an obdurate, Untempered cheek,âand a red mouth that never Has learnt its heavenly use. I think I see her What I would make her; I am called to it As tiller to his toil. And ignoranceâ The bonds I made in ignorance, before I knew there were such powers, this youth, this loving; Bonds senseless as the winter covenant Of frost-bound forest that, at rise of sap, Breaks into red and oliveâmust avail For life's suppression! I am still a boy, Young as they figure Cupid, so my Hubert Hath often carolled. Ah, the sunny lad, I could not be his rival; and the fact, That must be nailed through flesh and bone to fasten My unsubmitting senses to the cross, Is this: I am betrothed. [Enter Hubert.] Hubert. Almund, the darling, That with her wildness and her storms has made Such wreck of my astonished heart, refuses To listen to my importunity. Almund. Then do not urge her, Hubert, 'tis a nature That must not be distressed. Hubert. But she is certain, Sweet fellow, that you love her: to prevent Vain hope, I told her that you could not love, Being betrothed. Almund. Oh, Hubert, you said justly. [Aside] Birds make no covenant; they sing and build; There's no before and afterâ Hubert. And I think That I can comfort her. Almund [turning away]. Stiff promises And resolutions, and yon fleeting clouds Grow golden as they travel. Hubert. You will speak, And make her understand? For, were you free, I think that I could move you, in compassion To woo her for yourself. To see her suffer Is just like speaking to a child that's lost; One cannot help, one cannot show the way, And she keeps sobbing. Almund. I will go to her. Hubert. You must not break her heart. Almund. By noon to-morrow I'll yield her to more tender guardianship. Oh, Hubert, it is sweet to be belovedâ 'Tis to be born again, and find the world Waiting the senses' pleasure, at one's feet. It never hath been known how women love; But those unpractised lips let fall a secret Most terrible, transforming. Can you bear The pressure of such passion? Hubert. You forget, Dear Almund, that she gave the cup to you. Tis not for Hubert to be much beloved, Nor is he covetous; 'tis but to soothe her I ask your intervention. Did I think That you would bruise her, with harsh, tyrannous, Will-breaking wordsâ Almund. I shall be just and patient. Come to the woods, and you will find it quelled, This pitiful rebellion. Hubert. Plead with her! To you, love is a duty; but your friend Is bold to promise summer to his wife, That shall creep lingering round the agÃ¨d years And recreate them golden. Almund. I will offer No blandishments;âan error to correct, An ignorance, and mischief to remove, And then my task is ended. Seek your bride By that lone well amid the bulrushes, Where I so often wanderâ Hubert. And none drink! A cheerless place, blocked by the meadow-sweet, And willow-herb in autumn; I remember Your moody haunt by the mud-stifled stream, That now must be half-spectral with the stalks Of skeleton, grim reeds. I hate the aspect Of that neglected well where everything Is put from its right purpose, or forgotten. Bring me the lass where yesterday she stooped Her pitcher in the spring. Almund. Just at its source! You shall have all your pleasure. [Exit Hubert.] How unconscious In his beseeching and perplexity! 'Tis blessÃ¨d that he craves her, otherwise I could be wild and wanton. [Draws out tablets and writes.] [To an old gardener who approaches.] Reuben, take This letter to your mistress. Reuben. Ay, sir, and happy; but she hasn't left the terrace-walk an hour. It's my belief she spied you coming through the shrubs, for, bless you, sir, she was off, leaving her pruning-knife under the rose-tree,âher hair was a bit blown on her forehead, and her hands sort o' sticky. She likes you, sir, to see her in her best; and I shouldn't wonder if she isn't putting on that lavender gown took your fancy last June, with fresh sprigs at her bosom. I say to her, the taste of young gentlemen will change. I've worked for the great families,âthey like carnations one year, and the next nothing but pansies will please them. I'll be up the teep in no time; for, sir, she'll think more of this [holding up the letter] than of the buds on the tree that's named after you, though she smells at the pink blossoms as if they were lilacs in full bloom. It's all sweet, I reckon, when one is young, and of a warm climate inside like the vine-house. [Exit.] Almund. So it should be in youthâall sweet. How hateful Become the creatures that one ought to love, What heathendom our past with them! That day When we stood peering down into the stream Together, and I smiled: Look, Millicent, How Heaven mates us! we had brought our books To learn by heart; but even then I feel I could not bear her touch upon my shoulder, And when we read of dire Necessity I thought she had that form. She shared my studies, The noble woman-scholar, and I fancied, [Enter Millicent. I fancied that I loved her. Oh, my Hubert, Gleeful and foolish in yon purple copse, How you will mock my wisdom! Down the beeches The lady paces in that blemished gown I hate the long, limp folds of. I remember The child wore a blue, spotted skirt, and apron Sprinkled with berries. Well, there are three yards Betwixt us still. Better at once begin. Now she is nearer I discern a smile Irrelevantly silver on her brow; I hate such unwooed shining.âMillicent, There is not any reason in the world Why we should not be married? Millicent. But this query, Abrupt, and so impulsive, furnishes Sufficient reason. I would have you wait Until you are a man. Almund. To love you better? Oh, that can never be! You ask too much; For the boy's adoration cannot wear On into manhood. Millicent. But I dreamed, beloved, That something fairer would remain, a rose Of June, when all spring's flickering flowers were shed. I have so watched you. Almund. And the vigilance Were pardonable in maternal eyes, But in a wifeâ Millicent. Almund, if I believed The noble spirit you have made my own Would not grow riper 'neath my wifely care, I never would ensheath it in my love. Dear, I must foster you. Almund. I shall not answer Your foolish dreams; put by your expectations, And let me play my part: we lived retired, But my year's kingship has already taught me I cannot be a vessel to be moulded By any woman's will. I shall become Another being as the years increase, And your fond worship of my youth will vex As any ancient, lapsed idolatry. You too must change. Millicent. The stream will darken, dear, Infallibly, if there are clouds o'erhead. Almund. I mean, I do not ask you to desire Always my highest goodâyou must remember If you are married to me, we shall meet Not in elected moments, but in moods Often discordant; you will find me sullen, Morose, reserved, and must not diet me With simples from your herbal: ask no questions, Imagine nothing: let me find you merry, If I need merriment, sad, when I grieve. I speak thus frankly to prevent mistake, And disappointment after we are married, As we must be at once. The northern tribes Have broken on us. I would leave a queen To guard my kingdom. Millicent. Whom you will not trust To rule your heart. Almund. Not the despotic way; I must be free and irresponsible. Is it so slight a thing that I can leave you Sole regent of my kingdom? Would you rather Sway my caprices than be made the mistress And governor of all that I possess? 'Tis an unqueenlike choice. Millicent. I have not made it; We must no more interpret what the other Suffers, or fails to suffer. Almund. Many things Disturb me. Hubert, my supremest soldier, Is changed and petulant. Millicent. What ails your Hubert? Almund. He's deep in love. Millicent. For the three thousandth time? Almund. Once, as death strikes; one cannot tell before!â The difference 'twixt innocence and guilt, 'Twixt peace and wildest ferment! Hubert loves A forester's young daughter, and to-morrow I go to bid her marry him: she's wilful. Millicent. You speak from knowledge; you have looked on her. Almund. She gave us drink as we rode down the wood. To see his pride fall off him! He forgot She was a peasant; the bright, naked feet Were beautiful to him, and the wild hair, That brushed one as she stooped,âno pony's mane Is rougher, and our Hubert loves to see A lady's tresses subject to her art; Yet when this woodland lassâ Millicent. You do not name her. Almund. She has no name, one does not think of that; She carols like a birdâto Hubert's ear; One holds one's breath to listen. He neglected To ask her name. Millicent. Almund, you are quite certain That she will love him? Almund. 'Tis enough for woman To be beloved; she never must put forth Her powers of loving; 'tis not to be borne. Millicent. Yea, if she love her husband, tho' he slight her, Unconscious of her worship, she can spend Her unwooed kisses on her babes, and give Her womanhood's crown jewels as an alms. 'Tis nobler surely than to wed unloving, And hate the very moulding of the lip One feeds from one's own bosom. Almund. You forget How Hubert dotes; the glory of great dames Grows cloying and monotonous to one Who once has seen a girl's breast heave with passion, And watched her wonder at the miracle That love was working in her. He is changed, Humbled and changed; but we will do him honour; He shall be made an earl. Millicent. Simply for winning His heart's desireâsuch conduct needs reward? Nay, if the king himself had coveted This girlâsuppose it possibleâand yet, For sake of his pre-contract with a princess, Renounced her, I indeed should count him worthy Of gravest admiration. 'Tis not noble To stoop from our conditions, which involve Our duties; to forego, for sake of them, Some pleasure that would tempt us from our place, Would give a kingly impress to an action Worthy a woman's deepest reverence, And worship of a queen. Our bright-lipped Hubert Is but indifferent to external things; Yet this is somewhat: let us give to him The title he despises.âAnd our weddingâ You wish to speak of itâaffairs of state Demand the form; but for the sacrament? Almund. The bond, my princess, never shall be formal. I leave you for these wild, uncertain wars, My wife, to be the mother of the son Our kingdom craves: there is no greater trust. Millicent. Than that of regentâguardian too and nurse, Protective of your treasure? You are weary To-night and anxious; had I been your lady, I should have begged you to disburthen, now You crave but my queen's wisdom I retire, And leave you to self-healing. Almund. Millicent, 'Tis as you took the heliotropes away, I love the scent of. There are fierce temptations, And troubles of such sort as candour's self May not give tongue to; this must be:âthe maiden Is reticent, for nature drops a secret Most precious in her bosom; but the boy Turns to wild conflict with the fiends. Millicent. A husband Fights with a strong-armed angel at his side; You seek such safeguard 'gainst your enemies? My Almund, it is yours. O lovely brows! [Stooping and kissing his forehead.] 'Twixt welcome and farewell there is but little In woman's life, except she be a queen, As you will make me. Then all's different. [Exit.] Almund. How sweet a majesty is in her steps, How undeserved a grace! Now she is gone 'Tis as the ordering sunlight were withdrawn, And each unguided action perilous. Yet she approves my course, my Hubert's marriage, Even our ownâI am the more confirmed To keep our contract. Just that little figure To frighten to conformity. Ah me! [Exit.] Scene II. The Wood. Enter Almund and Cara. Cara. My dear is come, is come! [They clasp in a long, silent embrace.] Almund. O little love, My woman, pre-elected from the hour I was conceived a man, yet lost, forbidden! All the great, germinating force that pushes A leaf-bud forth has bounded to your mouth To form that kiss. Cara. Down in my heart it lay, Panting to reach you all this long, long while, My king, my lover. Almund. Ah, to join these names, As this frank voice is able!âBy and bye I'll face the severing hour. God, we may hold For just a moment what we may not keep, And thus conceive our sacrifice. Cara. But listen: I ran and gathered the white, blinking sallows, The shoots of cuckoo-pint, and fallen cones, To dress my fountain ready. Almund. Is it true You put these dabbling bunches round the spring For me? Then they are dearer than the banners That hailed me king. Cara [stooping over the spurges]. I told you he would come, You tiny flowers, and you would not believe; Now look at him, and love him. You dear man, I wonder what I had to think about Before I saw you. Now I have no time For sleep; I dare not go to bed at all, Lest I should find it altered in my heart When I awake; and sometimes in my bosom I lose all breath, and dare not think of you, The world is grown so large. Almund. It is the freedom Of love, that breaks all puny bonds, and rushes Clean through our being to God's crystal sea. Kiss me again. Cara. But it is not good-bye. I put my musk-pot in the window-sill, And all is sweet and warm there in the sun For hours; and I must do this every day, If the young plant's to thrive. Again to-morrow, And every day for ever you will come; It never will be ended. All the birds Are singing in me, and the crowds of flowers Are tossing in my joy. You must not watch me As you were putting by this happiness, To think about hereafter. Thousand kisses Keep growing for my lover; up they spring, And I could dance to feel them. Almund. Little mouth, Your love were perfect if it kissed to death; But I am strong; all voices wail in me I cannot die. The glory of this moment Is fearful, for it shows how black and small We are in common life, when Memory Makes gossip in our ears. Shall she be called The mother of sweet poetry who fetters All aspiration, drags us down to earth, And makes us mortal, petty, scrupulous, Slaves, cowards, fatalists? I must remember Hubert will soon be here. Oh, Cara, Cara, Did he not tell you that I am a king, And you must never love me? Cara. Your false friend, He said you had a lady. Almund. It is true. Oh, what is hell but truthâa fiery candour! [Breaks from her.] Cara. Why do you cast me out into the wind? You were my lover. Are you now the king, The cruel king? Almund [throwing himself on the ground and burying his face in the grass]. I cannot bear to hear The foot-fall of her voice. God! she will come, And bleat for me;âlambs wander over graves, And stop, and bleat, and shake their woolly heads.â I will be buried from her sight. Cara. It hurts Too much to leave off loving suddenly. That is an early wasp,âthey used to sting me When they settled on my arm. How hard I feel! I knew it must be terrible to freeze, And broke the brookâit ached so underneath; I know now how it ached. I must not love him! I shall not any more: it is as certain As that no breath can issue from the dead. [Shaking Almund.] Turn back your face. Oh, you are old and changed; And yet you look as you would live for ever. I cannot understand. Almund. You raised my head Too soon, before the penal change was over; It was the moment of my sentence, dearest, And it was more than I could bear to see The buds, the ruby twigs, the darting light, And your loved, early face. Cara. You have put death Far off. . . . I feel that I can never reach So many miles away. I'm but a child, And you have left me nothing. Almund. God, I know The pain to come is cruel, brutal, vile. Cara. You do not know; you took the cup of water, And gave it to your friend. You do not love me. Almund. I love you far beyond all kissing's pace, Faster than thought, with every breath I draw. Cara. Then keep me, keep me! Almund. Little life, I cannot. There is a lady, who for many years Has loved me, not like you, but with affection As strong as the unswerving confidence She places in my honour. Cara. And you love her? Almund. Nay, Cara, not a whit. I do not love her, Yet she shall be my wife. Cara. Poor lady! Almund. Cara, If you can feel for her who keeps me from you, Who severs us, a loving, unloved woman,â Be yet a little kinder still, and pity The man who cherishes, and longs for you, My noble Hubert, who with thoughtless ardour, As delicate as rash, has yet a way Of touching like a nurse. My little, wounded, Piteous Cara, let him take your hand, And shelter you from loneliness. Cara. Oh, cruel! So base you spoil my love, you hurt it all, Till I must cry for shame. I am too young, Too mere a slip, to understand your wishes; But they are cruel, cruel, and so wicked That you will talk in vain. Almund [aside]. Her chaste resentment Lashes me like a wind.âOh, Cara, Cara, If I can yield to Hubert my dear passion, My whole delight in you, while you, for me, Will to my friend resign yourself in marriage, Shall we not be united? He will join Together our best goodness on the day He marries you and owes you to my loss. Could you but understand! Cara. It is too bitterâ All that you say; it falls like flakes of snow. I'm numb and hopeless, and my merry joys Are dropping off for ever. Almund. O my God! Can it be rightly doneâwithin her blood To kill the blessÃ¨d life, and make its promise A scattered vanity? Yet Hubert comes, And Millicent awaits me, and the power To gather joy unmerited belongs In no-wise to my nature. Will you then Receive from me my friend to be your husband, To comfort you, to foster? Come, the tears Are staunched at last; but do not clasp your hands, And knot them like the little oak above. Speak to me, Cara. Cara. I am humble now. Almund. What do you mean? Cara. I will obey you, king. Almund. How hard and cold your words! Cara. For I am dead, Dead to the spring, and hope, and mating-time. Almund. Both blasted, both deformed, God looking on, And April in the earth! We each are spoiled For nature's stainless function; but the blight Is deeper in my girl; for I am strengthened By bonds and conscience. Hubert comes at last. [Enter Hubert at a distance.] Cara [springing up at Almund]. I'll kill myself unless you promise me, I'll curse you like a ghost unless you ask him To let me give you water once a year, To let me grasp your face into my being, And hear your wintry voice. I'll curse your wife, Your friend, and all you love so preciouslyâ Listen, you king, I'll curse them all unless You make him vow. Almund. Hubert will grant this favour. [Aside.] Then there will be one day of resurrection, One day the grave-clothes will be tenantlessâ Oh, heavenly condition! Hubert. Have you won, My Almund? Almund. She is yours. Hubert. Then come to me, My king-wooed joy! Almund, she does not stir; You misinterpret. Almund. No; she does but pause To hear me ask a boonâthat you and I Shall meet her once a year upon the spot Where first we saw her, by the creeping rill, And she shall give to me alone a cup Of the slow-dropping water. Will you grant This wish of hers and mine? It is some comfort For her new-aching grief. You understandâ I have been harsh and lofty. Hubert. This is little, A thing scarce worth the asking from a friend, Who loves you, and who owes you everything, Even his treasured bride. My Cara, rise, Come to my arms. I do not ask a smile, Until we know each other, and are friends Well-learnt in love. Say, with your woodland voice, That you are mine. Cara. I'll marry you. Hubert. Dear child, You startle me; your voice has lost its tones Of waking bird-songs; if indeed you care No tittle for me, I may pine with grief, But I will leave you happy. Cara. Do not go; Make me your wife. Hubert. God witness that I will; For I have loved these tiny lips, these eyes, Thrilling with shadowed impulse, and a light Of new-year sunbeams, loved them hour by hour, Day after day, have thought of them at dawn, At noon, and eve. Almund [aside.] I loved her so entirely I never saw her beauties one by one. Cara. When I am married . . . I will be good and gentle. Hubert. Darling! Cara. Do not Believe I shall be disobedient. Hubert. I never fear it, and your waywardness Is lovelier than submission. Put aside This anxious scanning of your new estate. Cara. I will be meek and dutiful. Hubert. Hush, hush! You mind me of a bird whose nest is stolen: An anguish of re-iteration pours Sharp on the air. Do not be frightened, Cara, To leave your home. My friend has given me This tract of trees, and a lone castle near; There shall you dwell, and freely as of yore Shall haunt the spring, and pluck the shady flowers. A piercing sunbeam strikes across your face; Trust me, my love, we'll have no formal manners, But roam the forest, you a woodland countess, And I a rustic earl. Come, I have won Your father, while the king was winning you. You are my bride: bring with you all your graces, And do not fear men's looks more than the glance Of jays or critic squirrels; let your movements Keep their alert caprices, and your voice Its acrid key, and sudden songfulness. Be all you were, and be my own besides, But do not change. Cara. I will be good. Hubert. Come, come! No more of that, it pains me. Like a child, Kiss me to heal the hurt. Cara. I will. Hubert. The flavour, The fine, elastic pressure of these lips Is gone; but I forget, I must have patience, Till you link Hubert's name with happiness, With gifts, and life, and bounty. Do not trouble That I should know how you have set your heart Unwitting on the king; so loyally I love him, I could give him even you, Were he not plighted. We will only live, Dearest, to do his pleasure. Almund. Once a year,â Never meanwhile,âI meet in frosty March The good earl's wife. [Aside, kissing her brow.] God seals upon their foreheads Those whom He chooses, His elect. Farewell. [Exeunt.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. The Terrace-Walk. Enter Millicent. Millicent. I have not seen my terrace-walk two years. Now that the rumour reaches me my husband Is coming home, I have put by my rule, And left the busy city for a day, To see if the young sycamore he planted Be grown, and all the bosky paths kept clear. He used to love the garden. In my absence There have been changes, the great storm has broken That row of poplars that shut out the country; We can see Hubert's lodge; the woody fringe Is full of gaps. How fares the lady Cara? [Enter Reuben at a distance.] There's my old man to gossip with; but yet It were more queenly to await events, And give them quiet audience. [To Reuben.] This ivy,â Reuben, your master likes it clipped in March; It overtops the wall. Reuben. Now what an eye! There has not been the time, though I'm a rare one For clipping; you can scarcely tell the nature Of any of these trees, I've twisted them So to my pattern. You, I recollect, Were always for a garden a bit wild; The weeds, you thought, were pretty on the walks Where they could do no harm. Millicent. But the king likes The even gravel; you can give me pleasure Only as you content him. Reuben. That's the point. I never saw a lady like yourself So anxious; all would now be apple-pie, If you had a fresh colour. When I wheeled you I' my barrow down the walks, and made you wreaths Of hen-and-chicken daisies every day, Save Sunday, when you whimpered,âwhy, you were A pretty one, and no mistake, with solid, Round, rosy cheeks; you've fallen off in flesh, And lost that placid look the master liked;â Come now, I know he liked it, for one day, When you were but a princess, he was standing And looking toward your lattice, while I cursed The bitter, grating wind: Ah, there's fair weather For you, I doubt not, Sir, I saidâbit riled To see him staring so; but when I looked, And saw you like a balsam at the pane, I did not wonder. Millicent. Is his friend arrived, The good lord Hubert? All our preparations Are vain, if he be absent. For two summers They have been kept apart by these long wars, My husband in the north, and his dear captain Striving to quell the western tribes. No rumour Has reached you, Reuben, of the earl's return? Reuben. Not a word; but his lady must be missing him. It's lonely for a woman when her child dies, and she has to look after his burial. We can put the little things in their coffins. It is not fit a mother should do that,âshe's too warm and tender. Millicent. A child, a child! And did you say a son? But the babe's dead and blasted! Reuben. Well, I own I never thought good luck would come of it After the christening.âSeemed presumptuous Of a young wench that might have been my daughter To make her brat a namesake of the king. Millicent. The lady Cara had then a fair babe? Would it had lived! Reuben, you misconstrue; 'Twas duteous of the mother to remember Who raised her husband to nobility. Most gladly had the king been god-father To our dear Hubert's son. Reuben. But Almund, Almund! To hear the common children shout his name! For she would take the little fellow down To paddle in the spring and sail the flowers; And all the villagers were fond of her, And the boy too. You must not take it ill;â I think it right that you should know;âthe women All said he was the image of the king. I went myself to have a look at him One day, and it was wonderfulânot like!â Why, the blue larkspurs come up blue this year, And last;âhe'd got the lashes, and the eyes, And the high forehead. It had been more decent To call him Hubert. Taking all in all I think it is as well he's with the Lord, Where he can do no mischief with his looks, Poor innocent! Millicent. O Reuben, you forget His mother. Reuben. But if she'd no rights to him? Lord, how you startle me with that hot face; 'Tis like the day of judgment,âflame of hell, Before one gets a hearing. Millicent. You remember Your master when he courted me,âhis aspect Might well seem god-like to a peasant girl. One day, at hunt, grown thirsty in the wood, He asked for drink: Lord Hubert loved the child Who filled the cup, and, at the king's command, She married him, but never has forgotten Her bright, brief day of honour. Once a year She offers tribute from the spring by which She first obeyed her king. If her sweet son Were like him, it is hard to think he died, Being the only creature in the world Who might have brought some comfort to your mistress. Let the truth travel like a cleansing frost Through all the country side. You promise me? Reuben. Why, lady, it's too much to remember, and you knock it so into my head with your sharp, clanging voice,âit bewilders me. But I take it you're satisfied with the young master; leastways, whatever you think, you won't have tongues wagging. I'll quiet 'em, I'll say no man can tell the colour of a bloom before it opens. It doesn't depend on the seed. And they won't contradict me. So, good even. [Exit.] Millicent. A barren wife, and the young boy born like him Not hisâso much dishonour and no sin; All faithful to their vows! [Looking towards Hubert's castle.] The sun breaks out After the gusty rain, and rims yon towers. Ah, Hubert's wife can take him to a grave, Where they can weep together. [Buries her face in her hands.] [Enter Almund.] Almund. Millicent. Millicent. You are not unexpected, though you come More suddenly than looked for. All your fields Are sown for harvest, and the river dammed Just where you thought to stop the current's rush; Old Reuben has been singing many a day Over the rose-shoots and the trim arcade. O husband, why so sudden a return? I scarcely have prepared . . . Almund. You are too noble For ghastly fooling, for this weary talk Of preparation. Ready for my coming! Yes, ready with your sobs. Millicent. A little weeping That I was desolate. Almund. I have not heard Ill news; I feel it in the air, and see it Now in your face. Why did you weep? I thought It was because you could not lift a son To give that heart-deep greeting that a wife No other way can utter. Tell me all: The pulses of my heart are muffled bells That toll and shiver:âgive me utmost truthâ This pausing is unworthy. [Grasping Millicent's arm.] Millicent. Hubert's wife Bore him a son, a lovely boy that died Just as he prattled Mother. He was nursed Beside a forest-brook; the peasants say He had your stamp on every lineament, His eyes your very ownâand I rejoice. Almund. Immeasurable faith! You hold my name Unspotted by my people's vile suspicion; You love the likeness that another wrought In pure idolatry? I thought you cold, Too cold to be a mother, and a softness, A joy has crept into your face as though You answered a babe's cry. We draw together; My Millicent, weep on. Millicent. The little lad Was christened Almund. Almund. But the mother lived? Millicent. She lives for you to comfort her. Almund. Not deadâ Millicent. There is another remedy than death; It shall be given her. This is a moment When speech takes on its full reality, And says the whole within us. You have loved This cottage-girl as God would have a man To love a woman; you fulfilled His dream. I have upheld you in your covenant To me, and made you break the holy law Of perfect, human passion. O my king, You were a noble boy, and year by year The beauty goes from off you. Almund. Millicentâ Millicent. We each have sinned; but I, because I love you, 'Scape inner ruin: you, my tortured husband, Are cramped by loveless honour, straitened, spoiled, Grown hard and bitter, though your conquering lips Keep violent mastery o'er pain and want. Almund. O God, you can befriend my agony, You suffer with my passion? Noble wife, I, who can never love you, from henceforth Worship with all my soul. Millicent. I have confessed, My Almund, and committed to my voice The silences of womanhood, that you Might hear the love that you can never see, Because I have no child. My lips present A gift of such devotion as no travail Hath ever brought to birth: a solemn gift To hold forth to a husband. Take the vows, Given in marriage, back again. How pale You stand, as if misjudging me! I know That you are pure as I in the fulfilment Of our unblessÃ¨d bond. Almund. Oh, I could curse My tongue that will not say what still I feel, That troth should be for ever. Millicent. Would you keep me The thing I am, a wife, and the eternal Thou shalt not to a man's felicity, That he perforce must hate? Almund. I do not, hating Myself alone. Millicent. I will deliver you. Your voice grates on me,â'tis a voice in irons. Almund. O fearful love! But you forget my Hubert Has he no rights? Millicent. Almund, I do not think Of Hubert; I will answer for no man In such a coil as ours. What I have said Lies between you and me; I loose the fetters That make your home a prison. You shall speak All in your writhing heart, renew its passions, And fear no impious jealousy, no pride Of injured claims. I pray you to entrust Your pain, your deathless love for Hubert's wife, To me, who, self-divorced from you, shall give No mis-becoming comfort, no unchartered Compassion and relief. Almund. Then be my friend, Not the dishonoured wife whom I shall never Forgive myself for wedding. Millicent, As no young bridegroom dare, I lay my soul Naked before your eyes. I thought I loved you; Suddenly passion leapt in me,âpure fervours Of life; I strove to quell them, and I could not, But whelmed them in suppression, till my brain Was mad with evil. O my woman-friend, I know the deeps of sin as none can know Who do ill acts, for I have spent my days Looking down, down into the pit of hell, Because my love lay drowning in the slime, And I must watch, in agony that often Pressed through my flesh as dew, yet dried the tears For ever from my eyes. Millicent. You pause; my pity Stretches beyond all horror. Almund. Then it is For her, not me. The anguish of my guilt, My holy love polluted, were as nothing In misery beside the pressing thought Of how she suffered,âsuch a child, and yet All womanhood was waiting in her heart, Till I should wed her. The first year I went, And with her husband met her by the spring, She looked at me until I only saw Great, busy eyes that seemed to use my face As yarn to fasten on a spinning-wheel. I nearly died; upon my horse's neck I fell unconscious. Millicent. You are trembling now. Almund. With weakness at the outrush of my secrets From loneliness and burial: 'tis like The passage of an earthquake. Millicent. Let me press This burning forehead, for my hands are cold, While the divulging torrent of your voice Takes heed of nothing, but that I attend, Too merciful to comfort. Almund. I am freed, But all in ruins. Now you know the worst And best of my despairâits lustful madness, Its rooted love to her. As if I knelt Beside Christ's mother I am not ashamed, For your compassion, fouled by no reproach, Stings not my blood. Millicent. And once again this brow Is frank as in your boyhood, just as open, Thank God! Almund. I like to feel your touch, it seems To know me, and to soothe each painful throb Close to its source. But, Millicent, to-day According to my promise I should enter The forest. Millicent. Yes, I know, and you must hasten; The day wears on. Nay, do not start so wildly, For if you are ungentle, you will scare The little, childless mother, and may kill her Who is your Hubert's wife. Almund. I will be tender. Touch me again! Farewell, my great, new friend, The guardian of my soul. I kiss these hands, These saving hands. Your eyesâhow beautiful! Scene II. The Wood, by the Spring. Enter Cara. Cara. The little face Grew hard, I dared not kiss it any more; And now, unless he comeâIt is the day. How the birds quarrel!âI must just return, And dig the little grimy body up. All night I listened close down on the turf If he should call me; but he cannot call With those hard, alien lips. He seems to hate me, And I hate him,âI hate, I hate the dead, I do not want to see them any more, They are such changelings. When the neighbours came And looked at the stone image, with no trace Of want or feebleness, they called it like The little, tender, playful, tottering lad I stooped to steady. God could never mould A baby's dimpling cheek;âit's tears, tears, tears! He shapes the dead, and alters all the lines O' the lids and mouth; one cannot find the old, Sweet spots for kisses. Hubert will return And pet me. I have seen a dog some stranger Passes his hand across; it gives no pleasure, The creature feels it's kind, and then walks off More wretched. Ah, the baby did not know, He never tried to comfort. There's no use For Cara in the world: the old are useless, But then they are half-dead. I cannot cry, I know if once I sobbed that I should never Catch the sweet air again. The leaves are budding, These chestnut-leaves. Oh, they have woolly wraps, They're youngâquite little ones. [Enter Almund.] Almund. A widowed creature, With strange, snow-sprinkled hair, and empty eyes. I dare not startle her,âshe stands too nigh The precipice of death for me to thrill her With joyful news. Cara [turning and springing to him]. Why, he is grown a man! O Almund, Almund. This is wonderful! It hurts so at my heart. It must be years Since it all happened. Do not let me loose; If you will only stay a little while 'Twill be all over; you can settle then Whether it's wrong or right. Pull down your curls For me to play with. Silky, summer hair! I made his fine like this. Oh, I am happy. Don't speak, and change it. Almund. Cara, listen! Hush! I am not married to the queen. I'm free. Cara. And I am Hubert's wife! It makes me laugh; It is not true, and a wise king knows better Than make believe. I had a little son; God knew the truth; He built him step by step Like youâa perfect miniature, and yet With hair less auburn. I was glad to give him Cara's own hazel threads. He's yours and mine. You'll see him when you bury me; break open The tiny coffin; let us lie together. Almund. I dare you speak of death; you shall not die Till you are mine. What is your woman's hunger? You faint with it; but when a man must fast His appetite grows eager for revenge. Now, Cara, you must pay to me the debt Of love's long-rankling score. Come, cuddle close; Each stir and change you make is chronicled Through all my body, and the blessedness Repeats that I have got you in my arms, Till I can just believe it. These long years My life has been a barren sea-shore washed By surging floods of passion; nothing grew there, Nothing took root, there was no food, no shelter. Don't travel far away with those soft eyes! You're thinking of the child; it maddens me. Cara, I'm thirsty; give me of love's drink! Have you forgotten? Cara. No, for I remember A lady loves you. Almund, it is fearful . . . Almund. Call me the king. Cara [smiling]. I'm used not to the name. I shouted to my little lad so often On the brow of the big field where there's the echo, Simply to hear the name. O Almund, Almund, There must not be this misery again; We women cannot bear it. Once I saw her; She could not speak, but she just pressed my hand, And kissed me. I will give you back to her, If you will only stay a little while. Now say it over to me like a hymn, How you have always loved me. Do not promise That you will not forgetâI have no fear; It's graven in your eyes. But those three years You did not comeâbefore too he was born; I must not think of it. . . . It hurts again Here at my heart. O Almund, Almund, Almund! Something shrieks in me; I must call the child Across the fields. . . . [She shrieks and falls back dead. Almund. O God, she is a mother. The small, bleak spirit shrills out in the air A cry for love, and I am starving here: 'Tis death's strange irony; and once she stood The red lips kissing me as fast as dew Is shaken from a thorn. Oh, I shall find All the great years of hell inadequate To mourn this mighty error and defeat.â To put such gift away, and youth and manhood Stirring within me! I refused her love, And must cohabit now with lust for ever. She does not heed me. She is soft, maternal, And full of heavenly cares. I cannot touch her, I can but stand here damned and impotent, Most bitterly aloof, and unremorseful Of everything save virtue. [Enter Hubert.] Take her, Hubert; Though whether she be yours or mine, I know notâ An ancient gift come back upon my hands While you were at the wars. I gave her once; You begged her of me: women are not chattels To deal with as one's generosity May prompt or straiten. . . . Hubert. Almund, she is dead! Cara, my little wife,âoh, she has broken Her tender heart with grieving for our boy. No babe to fondle, no poor, clumsy Hubert To light the piteous smile for,âso you asked Grim death to take you where you might have rest, You little, weary creature. Why, 'tis something To see you lying, love, the pretty mouth Freed from all struggle, and the hazel eyes Fallen asleep,âthey were the dearest eyes In all the world,âbut when they looked so dumb, When nothing happened in them, and they grew A prison for the tears, I could but pray To fall in battle, and forget the pain; Yet all this while you have been happy, sweet, And singing with the child. You promised me You would be happy when the babe was born. This wavy hair! O Cara, we must smooth it; You must remember, love, that you are dead, And we must have some state; the king himself Will lift you. Almund, I could never rid her Of that poor, superstitious, fond belief You loved her: it would please her now to think You helped to bury her [looking up]. What have you done? You have not murdered her? I thought you came To comfort her, to drink the promised cup, And found her lifeless: but some guilty deed Is written on your brow. Almund. Death came between, Or you had found me an adulterer. Now, Hubert, judge me. Hubert. Hush, for there are devils This sweet face must not wot of. You accuse her To me, her husband, who am sure she loved you Heart-brokenly as God would have a sinner Yearn for His favour. Could you misinterpret? You have fierce, flaming eyes. Oh, it is cruel To think they fell on her. Almund. Yes, I have lusted; Yet, Hubert, she died quiet in my arms. I have not wronged you. Hubert. But your face is flint, As when I trusted you to plead for me, And found my Cara crouching and subdued, And you a moody tyrant. You've no touch For such fine natures. You have told her nowâ Have you?âthat she was wicked and unfaithful, For loving you. Almund. It is irrational To try to ope one's being to the dead; And, Hubert, you have never known your friend. You do not even call by their own names My sins and my temptations. I must back, Back to life's dreary offices. Farewell. [Going.] Hubert. The straight, gaunt figures! And how sharp a look He fixed on the poor outlines! Nay, I'll buy One more last grace for her. Almund, come back, And seal these eyes with kisses; they will purge you Of every evil thought. You stumble.âAlmund, What secret are you hiding from your friend? Could you not bear her importunity? It was most innocentâsuch as the princess, I mean the lady Millicent herself, Had scarcely blamed. Almund. What, do you lead me to her? Can she be mine now 'neath the coffin-lid, And will you never touch her any more, Nor look upon the face of her young son, Who bears my features? Will you make a place For me to lie beside her when I'm dead, And never come between?âI am her lover. Hubert. O Almund, you look youngâan exaltation, A glory in your face; the past unfolds In all its miracle,âfor, ah, how dearly If you have loved her, have you loved your friend. Take the brown head to rest upon your knee, For mine has simply been the nurse's part. The little one bore piningly, and now We've found where she belongs. Almund [folding Cara in his arms]. Oh, she had drink For a man's deepest thirst. Hubert. Poor, broken trifleâ All that is left to offer to my friend Amid this cursÃ¨d, senseless sacrifice. How dared you keep your love from her? Almund. The princess, My troth-plight; there were others. Hubert. I forgot, My Almund, you are born that none can live Without your love; there is no little weed But will proclaim its birthright to the sun; You hid from this sweet vetchling, and the leaves Lost all their sturdy twine.âAy, there were others. This blessÃ¨d heart, she could not understand That love can have no empery on earth, There are so many others. 'Tis but little That we can do for them, and yet to ease Their pain there hath been all this tragedy. I know not if 'tis well. Almund. She has the kisses Of three long years ago; my Hubert knows How dearly Almund rates him; Millicent Will in deep-bosomed friendship be my own; And things are settled on this blithe, green earth Almost as it were heaven, where happy souls Ne'er vex themselves with marriage. The young kingcups Are sprouting lustily, and golden nature Is full of her fresh joys. Oh, we must learn To drink life's pleasures if we would be pure, Deep, holy draughts, and the girl-cupbearer Must not be set aside.</field>
