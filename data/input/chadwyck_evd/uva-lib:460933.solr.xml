      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. It came to pass that when Agamemnon led the host of the AchÃ¦ans against Troia, his wife, Clytemnestra, the daughter of Tyndareus, fell away from her faithfulness, partly because she was wroth, or feigned to be so, with her husband, for having sacrificed their daughter Iphigeneia to turn aside the wrath of Artemis, and obtain a favouring breeze for the ships of the AchÃ¦ans; and partly because Ãgisthos, son of Thyestes, the brother of Atreus, father of Agamemnon, had gained her to his will. And when Agamemnon returned from Troia to MykenÃ¦, Ãgisthos and Clytemnestra slew him, and reigned over the Argives in his place, but Electra, his daughter, saved her brother Orestes, and sent him secretly in charge of a faithful servant to Strophios of Phokis, his father's friend. And when eight years had passed, and Electra had sent and received from him many secret messages, Orestes at last came, with his faithful friend Pylades, the son of Strophios, and the servant who had watched over him, to MykenÃ¦, that he might do as the God at Delphi had bidden him, and take vengeance on his father's murderers. And it chanced that when he came, his mother, Clytemnestra, had had a vision, which filled her with fear, and she sent her younger daughter, Chrysothemis, with funereal offerings to the tomb of Agamemnon. Electra meanwhile had never ceased to bewail her father's death, and because of this, her mother and Ãgisthos had dealt harshly with her.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENEâMykenÃ¦. On one side the entrance of the Palace; on the other, in the background, the funeral mound of Agamemnon; Agora and Temples in the centre, Argos in the distance. Enter Orestes, Pylades, and Attendant. Attend. Now, son of Agamemnon, who of old Led our great hosts at Troy, 'tis thine to see What long thou hast desired. For lo! there lies The ancient Argos, which, with yearning wish, Thou oft did'st turn to; here the sacred grove Of her who wandered, spurred by ceaseless sting, Daughter of Inachos: Io, daughter of Inachos, beloved by Zeus, and driven over land and sea by Hera, was one of the special deities of Argos, and the country was sometimes distinguished from other districts bearing the same name by the epithet Inacheian. and this, Orestes, Is the wide agora, Lykeian named In honour of the God who slew the wolves; Of the many conjectures as to the meaning Lykeian, Sophocles adopts that which connected it with the idea of Apollo, as clearing the country from the wolves that troubled it. Here on the left, the shrine of Hera famed; The temple of Hera lay between Argos and MykenÃ¦, about a mile and a half from the former city. And where we stand, MykenÃ¦, rich in gold, Thou look'st upon, in slaughter also rich, The house of Pelops' line. Here, long ago, After thy father's murder, I received thee, At thy dear sister's hands, to kindred true; And took thee, saved thee, reared thee in my home, To this thy manhood, destined to avenge Thy father's death. Now, therefore, O my son, Orestes, and thou, Pylades, most dear Of all true friends, we needs must quickly plan What best to do. For lo! the sun's bright rays Wake up the birds to tune their matin songs, And star-decked night's dark shadows flee away; Ye, then, before ye enter, taking rest, The roof of living man, hold conference; For as things are, we may not linger on: The time is come for action. Ores. Dearest friend, Of servants found most faithful, still thou giv'st Clear tokens of thy nobleness of heart In all that touches us. For as the steed, Though he be old, if good blood flows in him, In danger's hour still loses not his fire, But pricks his ears, so thou dost urge us on, And tak'st thyself thy station in the van. Wherefore, I tell thee what my mind approves, And thou, give heed, full heed, to all my words; And, if I miss the mark in aught, correct: For I, when I had reached the Pythian shrine, That I might learn by what device to wreak My vengeance on my father's murderers, Heard this from PhÅbos, which thou too shalt learn, That I myself, unarmed with shield or host, Should subtly work the righteous deed of blood. Since then we heard an oracle like this, Do thou go in, whene'er occasion serves, Within this house, and learn what passes there, That, knowing all, thou may'st report it well; Changed as thou art by age and lapse of years, They will not know thee, nor, with those grey hairs, Even suspect thee. And with this pretence Go in, that thou a Phokian stranger art, Come from a man named Phanoteus; for he Of all their friends is counted most in fame, And tell themâyea, and add a solemn oathâ That some fell fate has brought Orestes' death, In Pythian games, The mention of the Pythian games must be noted as an anachronism. The date assigned for their institution is B. C. 586. from out the whirling car Rolled headlong to the earth. This tale tell thou; And we, first honouring my father's grave, As the God bade us, with libations pure And tresses from our brow; will then come back Bearing the urn well wrought with sides of bronze, Which, thou know'st well, 'mid yonder shrubs lies hid, That we with crafty words may bring to them The pleasant news that my poor frame is gone, Consumed with fire, to dust and ashes turned. Why should this grieve me, when, by show of death, In truth I safety gain, and win renown? To me no speech that profits soundeth ill, For often have I seen men known as wise, Reported dead in words of idle tales, Orestes may be supposed to refer to Odysseus, who appeared and triumphed after the report of his death. There may possibly be a reference, intelligible to those who heard the play, to the story of Pythagoras, who, after an apparent death, returned to life, and preached the doctrine of the metempsychosis. And then, when fortune brings them home again, Gain more abundant honours. So I boast That I, from out this rumour of my death, Shall, like a meteor, blaze upon my foes. But oh! thou fatherland, ye Gods of home, Receive me, prosper me in this my way; And thou, my father's house, (for lo! I come, Sent by the Gods to cleanse thee righteously,) Send me not back dishonoured from the land, But lord of ancient wealth, and found at last Restorer of my race. So far I've said: And now, old friend, 'tis thine to watch thy task: We twain go forth. The true, right time is come, That mightiest master of all works of men. Elec. [Within.] Woe, woe is me! O misery! Attend. [To Orestes.] I thought, my son, but now I heard a cry As of some hand-maid wailing within doors. Ores. And can it be Electra, helpless one? Shall we remain and listen to her plaint? Attend. In no wise. Let us not attempt to do Aught else before what Loxias bade us do, And start from that, upon thy father's grave Pouring the lustral stream. For this shall bring Our victory, The two words, âvictory and strength,â habitually went together in the Pythian oracles and in formulÃ¦ of prayer. They were to an Athenian audience what âgrace and mercy,â âglory and honour,â would be to us. and strength in all we do. [Exeunt Orestes, Pylades, and Attendant. Enter Electra, followed by a train of Maidens. O holy light of day, And air with earth commensurate, Many the wailing songs, Many the echoing blow, On bosom stained with blood Thou heardest, when the night Of murky darkness ceased; And how, in all my vigils of the night I wail my hapless sire, It knows, the loathÃ¨d bed of hated house;â My sire, whom Ares fierce and murderous, On alien shore received not as a guest, But she, my mother, and her paramour, Ãgisthos, with the blood-stained hatchet, smote, As those that timber fell Smite down the lofty oak. And thou, my father, hast no pity gained From any one but me, Though thou a death hast died So grievous and so foul to look upon. But I at least will ne'er Refrain mine eyes from weeping, while I live, Nor yet my voice from wail; Not while I see this day, And yon bright twinkling stars; But, like a nightingale Of its young brood bereaved, Before the gates I speak them forth to all. O house of Hades and Persephone, O Hermes of the abyss, and thou, dread Curse, Hermes was the God who had led the soul of Agamemnon to Hades; the Curse, that which he had uttered, when dying, against Clytemnestra. And ye, Erinnyes, daughters of the Gods, Ye dreaded Ones who look On all who perish, slain unrighteously, On all whose bed is stealthily defiled, Come ye, and help, avenge my father's death; Send me my brother here, For I alone must fail, Sorrow's great burden in the balance cast. Chor. O child, Electra dear, Child of a mother guilty above all, Why dost thou ever wear thyself away In ceaseless, wailing cry, For him thy father, Agamemnon, slain, Long years ago by godless subtlety, Thy mother's, steeped in guile, By coward hand betrayed? May he who did the deed (If this my wish be right) Perish for evermore! Elec. Offspring of noble souls, Ye come to soothe my woes; I know it, yea, I comprehend it all, Nothing escapes my ken; And yet I will not leave my task undone, Nor cease to wail my hapless father's fate. Yet then who give me every token kind Of true affection's bond, Leave me, I pray, ah! leave To vent my sorrow thus. Chor. And yet with groans and prayers, From Hades' pool, where all that live must go, Thy sire thou can'st not raise, but passest on, Lamenting ceaselessly, From evil one might bear To woe that baffles every remedy, Where respite from our sorrows there is none. Why, why, I ask, dost thou Still in thy spirit seek Those evils hard to bear? Elec. Childish and weak is he Who learneth to forget The parents that have perished miseraby; Far better pleaseth me The wailing one who âItys, Itys,â The cry of âItys,â which the Greek ear found in the song of the nightingale, connected itself with the story of Tereus, king of Thrace, who married Procne, daughter of Pandion, king of Athens. Then doing violence to her sister Philomela, he tore out her tongue and imprisoned her, that she might not tell of the outrage. She, however, found means to tell her sister Procne by a piece of tapestry-work, and she, wroth with Tereus, slew his son Itys, and gave his flesh to his father that he might eat it. And then Zeus put forth his power, and changed Philomela into a nightingale, and Procne into a swallow, and Tereus into a hoopoo, and so the nightingale ever flies from the hoopoo and wails for Itys. Sophocles had dramatised the history in his Tereus, probably before the date of the Electra. mourns, The bird heartbroken, messenger of Zeus. Ah, Niobe! Niobeâcomp. the note on Antigone, 823. with all thy countless woes I count thee still divine, Who in thy tomb of rock Weepest for evermore. Chor. Not unto thee alone, My child, of those that live Have grief and sorrow come; Nor sufferest thou ought more than those within With whom thou sharest home and kith and kin, Iphianassa and Chrysothemis; And one is mourning in a youth obscure, Yet happy, too, in part, Whom one day the Mykenians' glorious land Shall welcome as the heir of noble race, Coming to this our soil, As sent by grace of Zeus, Orestes, come at last. Elec. Ah! him I wait for with unwearied hope, And go, ah! piteous fate! Childless, unwedded still; My cheeks are wet with tears, And still I bear an endless doom of woe. And he, alas! forgets All he has met with, all that I had taught. What message goes from me That is not mocked? for still he yearns to come, And yet he deigneth not, Yearn though he may, to show himself to us. Chor. Take heart, my child, take heart; Mighty in heaven He dwells, Zeus, seeing, guiding all: Resign to Him the wrath that vexes sore. And as for them, the foes whom thou dost hate, Nor grieve too much, nor yet forget them quite; Time is a calm and patient Deity: For neither he who dwells Where oxen graze on far KrisÃ¦an shore, The boy who sprang from Agamemnon's loins, Lives heedless of thy woe; Nor yet the God who reigns By Acheron's dark shore. Elec. And yet the larger portion of my life Is gone without a hope, And I am all too weak, Who waste away in orphaned loneliness, Whom no dear husband loves, But, like an alien stranger in the house, I do my task unmeet, And tend the chambers where my father dwelt, In this unseemly guise, And stand at tables all too poorly filled. Chor. Sad was his voice in that his homeward march, And sad when that sharp blow (There in his father's couch,) Of brazen axe went straight; Guile was it that devised, And lust that struck the blow, Engendering foully foulest form of sin, Whether it was a God, Or one of mortal men, That did the deed of guilt. Elec. Ah, day of all that ever came to me, Most horrible by far! O night! O sufferings, strange as wonderful, Of banquets foul and dark! Dread forms of death which he, my father, saw Wrought out by their joint hands, Who, traitorous, murdered him who was my life, And so brought death to me. May He who dwelleth on Olympos high, God, the Almighty One, Give them for this to groan all grievously; And ne'er may they in prosperous days rejoice, Who did such deeds as this. Chor. Take heed, take heed, and utter speech no more. Hast thou no thought from whence, Into what evils dread, Sorrows thou mak'st thine own, Thou fallest piteously? For thou hast reaped excess of misery, Still brooding over war In thine unquiet heart; With kings 'tis ill to strive. Elec. I was sore vexed with evils dire, yea, dire; I know it well; my wrath escapes me not. Yet in this hard, hard fate, I will not cease from uttering woe on woe, While life still holds me here. For who is there, companions kind and true, From whom to learn the speech that profiteth, Whose thoughts befit the time? Leave me, oh, leave me, friends that fain would soothe, For these my woes as endless shall be known, And never from my wailings shall I cease, Nor pause to count my tears. Chor. And yet, in pure goodwill I speak to thee, As mother faithful found, Not to heap ills on ills. Elec. What limit is there then to misery? What? Is it noble to neglect the dead? Where has this custom grown? May I ne'er share their praise, Nor, should I come to any form of good, Dwell with it peaceably, If I should stay my wailing sorrow's wings, And leave my father shamed? For if the dead, as dust and nothing found, Shall lie there in his woe, And they shall fail to pay The penalty of blood, Then should all fear of Gods from earth decay, And all men's worship prove a thing of nought. Chor. I came, my child, in earnest zeal for thee And for myself. But if I speak not well, Have thou thy way, and we will follow thee. Elec. I feel some shame, ye women, if I seem To over-weary you with many tears: But hard compulsion forces me to this, Therefore bear with me. What maid nobly born, Seeing a father's sorrows, would not do As I am doing,âsorrows which, by night As well as day, I see bud forth and bloom, In nowise wither,âI who, first of all, Have on my mother's part, yes, hers who bore me, Found deadliest hate; and then, in this my house, Companion with my father's murderers, I bow to them, and at their hands receive, Or suffer want. And next, I pray thee, think What kind of days I pass, beholding him, Ãgisthos, sitting on my father's throne, And seeing him wear all his kingly robes, And pouring forth libations on the hearth Where his hands slew him; last, and worst of all, I see that murderer in my father's couch, With her, my wretched mother, if that name Of mother I may give to one who sleeps With such an one as he; and she is bold, And lives with that adulterer, fearing not The presence of Erinnyes, but, as one Who laughs in what she does, she notes the day In which she slew my father in her guile, And on it forms her choral band, and slays Her sheep each month, as victims to the Gods That give deliverance; The monthly festival which Clytemnestra kept was after the pattern of new-moon feasts or others regulated by them. I, poor hapless one, Beholding it, (ah misery!) within Bewail, and pine, and mourn the fatal feast, The âfeast of Agamemnonâ had become proverbial as the type of treacherous hospitality, and it seems probable that the poet so framed Electra's words as to call up that association in the minds of his hearers. Full of all woe, that takes my father's name,â I by myself alone. I dare not weep, Not even weep, as fain my heart would wish; For she, that woman, noble but in words, Heaps on my head reproaches such as these: âO impious, hateful mood! Has death deprived Thee only of a father? Do none else Feel touch of sorrow? Evil fate be thine, And never may the Gods that reign below Free thee from wailing!â So she still reviles; But when she hears one speak Orestes' name, As one day coming, then in maddened rage She comes and screams, âAnd art not thou the cause? And is not this thy deed, who, stealing him, Orestes, from my hands, hast rescued him? But know that thou shalt pay full price for this.â So does she howl, and he too eggs her on, That spouse of hers as noble, standing near, That utter coward, that mere mischief, he Who with the help of women wages war. And I, who wait Orestes evermore To come and stop these evils, waste away; For he, still ever meaning to effect Some great achievement, brings to nothingness All my hopes here, and all hopes far away. At such a time, my friends, there is no room For self-control or measured reverence; Ills force us into choosing words of ill. Chor. Tell us, I pray, if thus thou speakest out, Ãgisthos being near, or gone from home. Elec. From home, most surely; do not dream that I, If he were near, had ventured out of doors; But, as it happens, he is gone a-field. Chor. So much the more would I take heart to hold My converse with thee, if indeed 'tis so. Elec. Yes, he is gone. Ask thou whate'er thou wilt. Chor. Well, then, I ask thee of thy brother first, Comes he, or stays he still? I fain would know. Elec. He speaks of coming; yet he nothing does. Chor. One who works great things oft is slow in them. Elec. I was not slow when I did save his life. Chor. Take heart. Right noble he, to help his friends. Elec. I trust, or else I had not lived till now. Chor. Not one word more; for coming from the house I see thy sister, of one father born, And of one mother, fair Chrysothemis; And in her hand she brings sepulchral gifts, Such as are offered to the souls that sleep. These commonly consisted of milk, honey, and oil. Comp. 896. Enter Chrysothemis, bearing funeral offerings. Chrys. What plaint is this thou utterest, sister dear, Here at the outlet of the palace gates? And wilt not learn the lessons time should teach To yield no poor compliance to a wrath That is but vain? This much myself I know; I grieve at what befalls us. Had I strength, I would show plainly what I think of them; But now it seems most wise in weather foul, To slack my sail, and make no idle show Of doing something when I cannot harm; And on this wise I wish thee too to act; While yet I grant that what thou think'st is just, Not what I say. But if I wish to live In freedom, I must bow to those that rule. Elec. Strange is it thou, who callest such a man Thy father, should'st forget him, and should'st care For such a mother. All this good advice Thou giv'st to me is not thine own but hers, Thy lesson learnt by rote. Take then thy choice; Or thou hast lost thy reason, or, if sane, Thou hast no memory of thy dearest friends, Who said'st but now, that, had'st thou strength enough, Thou would'st make plain the hate thou hast for them; And yet when I am working to avenge Thy father, wilt not join me, and would'st fain Turn me aside from action. Is there not In this, besides all else, a coward's heart? Tell me (yea, hear) what profit should I have Were I to cease from tears? Do I not live? In evil case I own, and yet for me Enough; and these I vex, and so I give Due honour to the dead,âif they can be Or pleased or thankful. Thou, with that thy hate, Hatest in words, and yet in act dost live In friendship with thy father's murderers. Never would I, no, not though one should bring To me the gifts which thou rejoicest in, Give way to them. No! Let thy board be spread With dainties rich, and let thy life be full; My only food be this, to spare myself What most would pain. I covet not thy place, Nor, wert thou wise, would'st thou. But, as it is, When thou might'st be the child of noblest father, Choose to be called thy mother's. Thus shalt thou To most men seem contemptible and base, Forsaking thy dead father and thy friends. Chor. By all the Gods, I pray thee, cease from wrath; In both your words, some profit may be found, If thou from her would'st learn, and she from thee. Chrys. I, O my friends, am somewhat used to hear Her words; nor had I now recurred to them, But that I heard of evil drawing near, Which soon shall stop her long protracted wails. Elec. Tell then this dreadful evil. Hast thou aught To tell me more than what I suffer now, I will resist no longer. Chrys. All I know Myself, I'll tell thee; for their purpose is, Unless thou ceasest from thy wailings loud, To send thee where thou never more shalt see The light of day, but in a dungeon cave, Immured alive, beyond our country's bounds, Shalt sing thy song of sorrow. Take good heed, And do not, when thou sufferest, all too late, Cast then the blame on me. Be wise in time. Elec. And is it thus they have decreed to treat me? Chrys. Beyond all doubt, when home Ãgisthos comes. Elec. If this be all, would God he may come soon. Chrys. What evil prayer is this, poor sister mine? Elec. That he may come, if this his purpose be. Chrys. What would'st thou suffer? Whither turn thy thoughts? Elec. To flee as far as may be from you all. Chrys. Hast thou no care for this thy present life? Elec. A goodly life for men to wonder at! Chrys. So might it be, if thou would'st wisdom learn. Elec. Teach me no baseness to the friends I love. Chrys. I teach not that, yet kings must be obeyed. Elec. Fawn as thou wilt; thy fashion is not mine. Chrys. Yet is it well through rashness not to fall. Elec. If fall we must, we'll fall our father helping. Chrys. Our father, so I deem, will pardon this. Elec. These words will win due praises from the vile. Chrys. Wilt thou not yield and hearken to my words? Elec. Not so; ne'er may I be so reft of sense. Chrys. I then will go the way that I was sent. Elec. And whither goest thou? Whose the gifts thou bring'st? Chrys. Mother to father bids me pour libations. Elec. How say'st thou? To the man whom most she hates? Chrys. âThe man she slewââ'Tis that thou fain would'st say. Elec. Who gave this counsel? Who has this approved? Chrys. 'Tis, as I think, some terror of the night. Elec. Gods of my fathers! Be ye with me now! Chrys. And does this terror give thee confidence? Elec. If thou would'st tell the vision, I should know. Chrys. I know it not, but just in briefest tale. Elec. Ah, tell me that; brief words ere now have laid Men low in dust, and raised them up again. Chrys. A rumour runs that she our father's presence (Yes, thine and mine) a second time to light Saw coming, and he stood upon the hearth, And took the sceptre which he bore of old, The words of Homer (Iliad, ii. 101) had given a special fame and import to the sceptre of Agamemnon. Which now Ãgisthos bears, and fixed it there, And from it sprang a sucker fresh and strong, And all MykenÃ¦ rested in its shade. This tale I heard from some one who was near When she declared her vision to the Sun; The prayer is told to the Sun, as the great dispeller of the dreams of darkness. Comp. 637. There is, perhaps, also a special reference to the local worship of the Sun at Argos. An altar to the Sun-God, Helios, stood on the way from Argos to MykenÃ¦. But more than this I heard not, save that she Now sends me hither through that fright of hers. [Electra, wild and impassioned, is about to speak. And now by all the Gods of kith and kin, I pray thee, hearken to me; do not fall Through lack of counsel; if thou turn'st me back, In trouble sore thou'lt seek me yet again. Elec. Ah, sister dear, of what thy hands do bear Put nothing on the tomb; for nature's law Forbids it as unholy thus to bring Funereal offerings, lustral waters pour, From wife unfriendly, on a father's grave. No! cast them to the rivers, hide them deep In dust where never aught of them shall come To where my father sleeps; but when she dies, Let them be stored below as gifts for her. For, surely, were she not the boldest found Among all women, ne'er would she have poured These hateful offerings o'er the man she slew. Think, if the dead who sleeps in yonder tomb Will welcome kindly gifts like these from her, By whom, most foully slain as hated foe, His feet and hands were lopped off shamefully, Who wiped upon his head the blood-stained knife, As if to purge the guilt. The words bring before us a curious phase of superstition. To mutilate the corpse of a murdered man was to deprive him of the power to take vengeance. To wipe the murderous weapon on his hair was not merely a symbol, but a charm. His blood was to be on his own head. And dost thou think To bring these gifts redeeming her from guilt? Not so. Nay, put them by, and then do thou, Cutting the highest locks that crown thy head, Yea, and mine also, poor although I be, (Small offering, yet 'tis all the store I have,) Give to him, yes, this lock, untrimmed, unmeet For suppliant's vow, and this my girdle, decked With no gay fringe. And ask thou, falling low, That he will come to us in mood of grace, From out the earth, a helper 'gainst our foes, And that his son, Orestes, with a hand Victorious, trample upon those his foes, In fullest life returning, so that we Hereafter may with gifts more bounteous come To deck his grave than those we offer now. I think, for one, I surely think that he Has sent these dark, unsightly dreams to her; But be this as it may, my sister, come And do this service, for thyself and me, Nor less for him, of all men most beloved, Our father, now in Hades slumbering. Chor. The maiden speaks with filial reverence; And thou, dear friend, if thou art wise, wilt do What so she counsels. Chrys. I will do it then. It is not meet with two to wrangle still, Debating of the right, but haste and act. But if I thus essay this enterprise, By all the Gods, my friends, be hushed and still; For if my mother hears it, well I trow That what I dare will end full bitterly. Chor. Stroph. If wisdom fail me not, As seer misled by doubtful auguries, And wanting counsel wise, She comes, true augur with foreshadowing tread, Vengeance, with hands that bear The might of righteousness: She comes, my child, full soon, in hot pursuit: And through my veins there springs a courage new, Hearing but now these dreams That come with favouring gale; For he, thy father, King of all Hellenes, Will not forget for aye, Nor will that hatchet with its double edge, Wrought out in bronze of old, Which laid him low in death With vilest contumely. Antistroph. And She shall also come, Dread form, with many a foot, and many a hand, Erinnyes shod with brass, Who lieth still in ambush terrible: For there has come to those For whom it was not right, The hot embrace of marriage steeped in blood, Of evil omen, bed and bride alike; But, above all, this thought Fills heart and soul, that ne'er The boding sign will come unblamed to those Who did the deed, or shared; Lo! men can find no prophecies in dreams, Nor yet in words divine, Unless it gain its goal, This vision of the night. Epode. Ah, in the olden time, Thou chariot race of Pelops, perilous, How did'st thou come to this our father-land In long-enduring gloom? For since he slept beneath the waters deep, Poor Myrtilos, Here, as in the case of âItys, Itys,â (l. 148,) we have a reference to myths, which Sophocles had taken as the subjects of his own dramas. The story of Myrtilos was briefly, that he enabled Pelops to win the chariot-race against Ånomaos, and so to gain his daughter Hippodameia and become king of Pisa; that then Pelops, unwilling to give him his reward, or suspecting him of loving Hippodameia, threw him headlong from Cape GerÃ¦stos. Myrtilos, as he died, uttered a curse on Pelops, and this was the starting point of all the evils of his house. who fell, Cast headlong from the chariot bright with gold, Both root and branch destroyed, There has not left our master's lordly house All shame and ignominy. Enter Clytemnestra, followed by an Attendant. Clytem. Thou, as it seems, dost take thine ease abroad, Ãgisthos being absent, who has charged That thou should'st not, being seen without the gates, Disgrace thy friends. But now, since he is gone, For me thou little carest. Yea, thou say'st Full many a time to many men, that I Am over-bold, and rule defying right, Insulting thee and thine. But I disclaim All insult, and but speak of thee the ill I hear so often from thee. Evermore, Thy father, and nought else, is thy pretext; As that he died by me .... By me? Right well I know 'tis true. That deed deny I not, For Justice seized him, 'twas not I alone; And thou should'st aid her, wert thou wise of heart, Since that thy father, whom thou mournest still, Alone of all the Hellenes had the heart To sacrifice thy sister to the Gods, Although, I trow, his toil was less than mine, And little knew he of my travail-pangs. And now, I ask thee, tell me for whose sake He slew her? âFor the Argives,â sayest thou? They had no right to seek my daughter's death; But if he killed mine for another's sake, His brother Menelaos', should he not Be righteously requited? Had not he Two sons, In Homer, (Iliad, iii. 175; Odyss. iv. 112,) Helen appears as bearing one child only, Hermione, to Menelaos. Sophocles follows a later form of the legend. who it was fit should die far more Than this my daughter, seeing they were born Of father and of mother for whose sake The armament went forth? Or was it so That Hades had a special lust to feast Upon my children rather than on hers? Or was it that her father cast aside, Cold-blooded, hard, all yearning for my child, Yet cared for Menelaos? Was he not In this a reckless father found, and base? I answer, Yes, though thou refuse assent; And she that died would say it, could she speak. I then feel no remorse for what is done; But if I seem to thee as base in heart, First judge thou right, then blame thy next of kin. Elec. This time, at least, thou wilt not say that I, Being first to vex, then heard these words from thee; But, if thou giv'st me leave, I fain would plead For him who died, and for my sister too. Clytem. I give thee leave. Had'st thou thus spoken always, To list to thee had given me less annoy. Elec. Thus speak I then to theeâThou say'st thy hand Did slay my father! Is there aught of shame Than this more shameful, whether thou can'st urge, Or not, the plea of justice? But I say Thou did'st not justly slay him, but wast led By vile suggestion of the coward base Who now lives with thee. Next, I pray thee, ask The huntress Artemis what guilt restrained The many winds in Aulis; or my voice Shall tell thee; for from her thou may'st not learn. My father once, as I have heard the tale, Taking his sport within the holy grove The Goddess calls her own, had raised a deer, Dappled, and antlered, and in careless mood Boasts loudly at the death. As the legend ran, the special form of the boast was, that he had surpassed Artemis in skill of chase. And therefore she, Leto's fair daughter, in her wrath detained The AchÃ¦ans that my father might perforce Slay his own daughter, in the balance weighed Against that quarry. Thus the matter stood As to that offering. Other means were none To free the army, or for homeward voyage, Or yet for Ilion. Therefore sore constrained And struggling, hardly at the last he wrought The act of sacrifice, and not through love For Menelaos. But had it been so, Had he done this with wish to profit him, (For I will take thy premiss,) ought he then To die by thine hand? Why, what right is this? See to it, giving men a law like this, If thou but cause fresh trouble to thyself, And change of purpose bringing late regret; For, should we evermore take blood for blood, Thou would'st fall first, if thou did'st get thy due. See to it well, lest thus thy vain pretence Be found as nought. For tell me, if thou wilt, In recompense for what dost thou now do Deed of all deeds most shameful, who dost sleep With that red-handed felon who with thee Murdered my father, and to him dost bear New children, while thou castest out from thee Those born before, right seed of righteous sire? How shall I praise these deeds? or wilt thou say That thus thou takest vengeance for thy child? Basely enough, if thou should'st say it. Lo! It is not good to wed an enemy, E'en in a daughter's cause. But since to speak A word of counsel is not granted us, Though thou dost love to speak all words of ill, That âwe revile a mother;ââyet I look On thee as more my mistress than my mother, Living a woeful life, by many ills Encompassed which proceed from thee, and him, The partner of thy guilt. That other one, My poor Orestes, hardly 'scaped from thee, Drags on a weary life. Full oft hast thou Charged me with rearing him to come at last A minister of vengeance; and I own, Had I but strength, be sure of this, 'twere done. For this then, even this, proclaim aloud To all men, as thou wilt, that I am base, Or foul of speech, or full of shamelessness: For if I be with such things conversant, Then to thy breeding I bring no disgrace. Chor. I see she breathes out rageâbut whether right Be on her side, for this no care I see. Clytem. And why should I give heed to one like her, Who thus her mother scorns? And at her age! Does she not seem to thee as one prepared To go all lengths, and feel no touch of shame? Elec. Know well, I do feel shame for all I do, Though thou think'st otherwise, and well I know I do things startling, most unmeet for me; But thy fixed hate and these thy deeds perforce Constrain me still to do them. Still it holds, Base deeds by base are learnt and perfected. Clytem. Thou shameless creature! I then, and my words, And my deeds too, they make thee prate too much. Elec. Thou sayest it, not I; for thou dost do The deed: and deeds will find their fitting words. Clytem. Now by my mistress Artemis, I swear, For this thy daring thou shalt pay in full When back Ãgisthos comes. Elec. Now look you there! Thou'rt swayed by fury, though thou gav'st me leave To speak whate'er I would, and can'st not learn To play a listener's part! Clytem. And wilt thou not Give leave to do my rites with clamour hushed, Seeing that I let thee speak thy whole mind out? Elec. I let thee, bid thee, do them. Charge not thou My lips with folly. Now, I speak no more [Retires to the back of the stage. Clytem. Do thou then, my attendant, bring the gifts Of many fruits, that I may breathe my prayers To this our King for respite from the fears Which now possess me. Hear, O PhÅbos, Thou Our true deliverer, hear my secret speech; For this my prayer is not among my friends, Nor is it fit to bring it all to light, While she is near me still, lest in her mood Of envy, and with cry of many tongues, She spread the vain report through all the town; But hear thou me; for thus I make my prayer; The vision which I looked on in the night Of doubtful dreams, grant me, Lykeian king, If they are good, their quick accomplishment; If adverse, send them on mine adversaries; And if there be that wish, by craft and guile, To hurl me from the wealth I now enjoy, Suffer them not, but ever let me live With life unharmed, and sway the AtreidÃ¦'s house, And these their sceptres, dwelling with the friends Whom now I dwell with, passing prosperous days With all my children, who nor hatred bring Nor bitter sorrow. This, Lykeian king, Apollo, hear all pitiful, and grant To all of us, as we implore thee now; All else, though I be silent, I will deem Thou, being a God, dost know. One well may think The sons of Zeus see all things. Enter the Attendant of Orestes. Attend. Might I know, Ye ladies, if these dwellings that I see Are those of King Ãgisthos? Chor. Even so! Thou guessest well, O stranger. Attend. Am I right In once more guessing that his wife stands here? For sure her mien bespeaks her sovereignty. Chor. Right, more than ever. Lo, she standeth there. Attend. All hail, O queen; I bring thee tidings good, Thee and Ãgisthos also, from a friend. Clytem. I hail the omen; but I fain would know This first, what man has sent thee here to us. Attend. The Phokian Phanoteus, discharging thus A weighty task. Clytem. And what its nature, pray? Tell me, O stranger; for right well I know Thou from a friend wilt bring us friendly words. Attend. Orestes .... He is dead. That word tells all. Elec. O wretched me! This day I perish too. Clytem. What say'st thou, stranger? What? ... Heed not her words. Attend. Orestes .... He is deadâI say again. Elec. Ah me! I perish utterly. All's lost. Clytem. Look thou to what concerns thee. But do thou, [To Attendant of Orestes.] O stranger, tell us truly how he died. Attend. For this end was I sent; and I will tell All as it happened. He then journeyed forth To those great games which Hellas counts her pride, To join the Delphic contests; Historically there is an anachronism here. The earlier contests at Delphi were confined to music, and the date given for the first Pythian games is, Ol. 47. 2, (B. C. 586.) So, too, the four-horsed chariot, and the presence of Greeks from Libya, belong to the poet's own time rather than to the Homeric period. and he heard The herald's voice, with loud and clear command, Proclaim, as coming first, the chariot race: And so he entered radiant, every eye Admiring as he passed. And in the race He equalled all the promise of his form In those his rounds, and so with noblest prize Of conquest left the ground. And, summing up In fewest words what many scarce could tell, I know of none in strength and act like him; But one thing know, for having won the prize In all the five-fold forms of race which they, The order of the Delphic games was as follows:âEarly in the morning the umpires (HellanodikÃ¦) sent the herald to proclaim their opening. They began with foot races, long and short; about noon came the pentathlon, (leaping, foot-race, discus, spear-throwing, wrestling,) later the chariot-race. The âfive-fold forms of raceâ (if the reading be correct) refer to variations in the rules or length of the course, not to the pentathlon, strictly so called. The umpires, had proclaimed for those that ran The ground's whole length and back, he then was hailed, Proclaimed an Argive, and his name Orestes, His son who once led Hellas' glorious host, The mighty Agamemnon. So far well. But when a God will injure, none can 'scape, Strong though he be. For lo! another day, When, as the sun was rising, came the race Swift-footed, of the chariot and the horse, He entered there, with many charioteers; One an AchÃ¦an, one from Sparta, two From Libya, who with four-horsed chariots came, And he with these, with swift Thessalian mares, Came as the fifth; a sixth with bright bay colts Came from Ãtolia; and the seventh was born In far Magnesia; and the eighth, by race An Ãnian, with white horses; and the ninth From Athens came, the city built of God; Last, a BÅotian, tenth in order, came, And made the list complete. The choice of nations mentioned by the poet was doubtless far from being capricious. Some are named (the AchÃ¦an, Magnesian, Ãnian, Thessalian, BÅotian, Argive) as conspicuous in the Amphictyonic league. The Spartan, as the rival of the AchÃ¦an, though having a more favourable start, falls into the background. The Libyans and Ãtolians are named as famous for their chariot-races, and so enhancing the glory of the Athenian victor. And so they stoodâ When the appointed umpires fixed by lot, And placed the cars in order; and with sound Of brazen trump they started. Cheering all Their steeds at once, they shook the reins, and then The course was filled with all the clash and din Of rattling chariots, and the dust rose high; And all commingled, sparing not the goad, That each might pass his neighbour's axle-trees, And horses' hot, hard breathings; for their backs And chariot-wheels were white with foam, and still The breath of horses smote them; and he, come Just where the last stone marks the course's goal, Turning the corner sharp, and, letting go The right hand trace-horse, pulled the nearer in; And so at first the chariots keep their course; But then the unbroken colts the Ãnian owned Rush at full speed, and, turning headlong back, Just as they closed their sixth round or their seventh, Dash their heads right against the chariot wheels Of those who came from BarkÃ¨. And from thence, From that one shock, each on the other crashed, They fell o'erturned, and Crissa's spacious plain Was filled with wreck of chariots. Then the man From Athens, skilled and wily charioteer, Seeing the mischief, turns his steeds aside, At anchor rides, and leaves the whirling surge Of man and horse thus raging. Last of all, Keeping his steeds back, waiting for the end, Orestes came. And when he sees him left, His only rival, then, with shaken rein, Urging his colts, he follows, and they twain Drove onward both together, by a head, Now this, now that, their chariots gaining ground; And all the other rounds in safety passed. Upright in upright chariot still he stood, Ill-starred one; then the left rein letting loose Just as his horse was turning, unawares He strikes the furthest pillar, breaks the spokes Right at his axle's centre, and slips down From out his chariot, and is dragged along, With reins dissevered. And, when thus he fell, His colts tore headlong to the ground's mid-space: And when the host beheld him fallen thus From off the chariot, they bewailed him sore, So young, so noble, so unfortunate, Now hurled upon the ground, and now his limbs To heaven exposing. Then the charioteers, Full hardly keeping back the rush of steeds, Freed the poor corpse so bloody, that not one Of all his friends would know him; and his body They burnt upon the pyre; and now they bear, The chosen of the Phokians that have come, In a poor urn of bronze, a mighty form Reduced to these sad ashes, that for him May be a tomb within his fatherland. Such is my tale, full sad, I trow, to hear, But unto those who saw it as we saw, The greatest of all evils I have known. Chor. Woe, woe! So perish, root and branch, it seems, The race of those our lords of long ago. Clytem. O Zeus! What means this ... Shall I say, good news? Or fearful, yet most gainful? Still 'tis sad If by my sorrows I must save my life. Attend. Why does my tale, O queen, thus trouble thee? Clytem. Wondrous and strange force of motherhood! Though wronged, a mother cannot hate her children. Attend. We then, it seems, are come to thee in vain. Clytem. Nay, not in vain. How could it be in vain? Since thou bring'st proofs that he is dead, who, born Child of my heart, from breasts that gave him suck Then turned aside, and dwelt on foreign soil In banishment; and since he left our land Ne'er came to see me, but with dreadful words, His father's death still casting upon me, Spake out his threats; so that nor day nor night I knew sweet sleep, but still the sway of Time Led on my life, as one condemned to death. But now, (for lo! this day has stopped all fear From her and him, for she was with me still, The greater mischief, sucking out my life, My very heart's blood: now, for all her threats, We shall live on and pass our days in peace. Elec. Ah, wretched me! for now I can but mourn, Orestes, at thine evil case, thus dying, By this thy mother scorned. Can this be well? Clytem. Not so with thee. For him what is is well. Elec. Hear this, thou Power, avenging him who died! Clytem. Right well she heard, and what she heard hath wrought. Elec. Heap scoff on scoff; thou'rt fortune's darling now. Clytem. Thou and Orestes, will ye check me now? Elec. We, we are checked, and far from checking thee. Clytem. [To Attendant.] Thou would'st deserve much praise, if thou hast checked, O stranger, that loud cry of many tongues. Attend. And may I then depart, my task being done? Clytem. Nay, nay; thou would'st not then fare worthily Of me, or of the friend that sent thee here; Come in, and leave this girl to cry without, And wail her own misfortunes and her friends'. [Exeunt Clytemnestra and Attendant. Elec. And does she seem to you, that hateful one, As one who grieves in bitter pain of heart, To wail and weep full sorely for her son Who died so sadly? Nay, (ah, wretched me!) She wends her way exulting. Ah, Orestes! Dear brother, in thy death thou slayest me; For thou art gone, bereaving my poor heart Of all the little hope that yet remained, That thou would'st come, a living minister Of vengeance for thy father and for me, Me miserable. Now whither shall I turn? For now I am indeed alone, bereaved Of thee and of my father. Now once more I must live on in bondage unto those Of all mankind most hateful far to me, My father's murderers. Goes it well with me? But I at least through all the time to come Will not dwell with them, but at this their gate, All reckless, friendless, waste away my life; And then, if one of those that dwell within Is wroth with this, why, let him slay me straight; I'll thank him, if he kill me; should I live There is but sorrow; wish for life is none. Chor. Where then the bolts of Zeus, And where the glorious Sun, If, seeing deeds like these, They hold their peace, and hide? Elec. [Sobbing.] Alas, ah me, ah woe! Chor. My child, why weepest thou? Elec. Fie on it, fie, ... Chor. Hush, hush, be not too bold. Elec. Thou wilt but break my heart. Chor. What meanest thou? Elec. If thou suggestest any hope from those So clearly gone to Hades, then on me, Wasting with sorrow, thou wilt trample more. Chor. And yet I know that King Amphiaraos Amphiaraos, seer as well as warrior, knowing by his art what would be the issue of Polyneikes's expedition against Thebes, at first refused to join, but afterwards yielded to the persuasion of his wife Eriphyle, whom Polyneikes had bribed. When the Argives fled, he and his four-horse chariot were smitten with the thunderbolt of Zeus, and the earth opened and swallowed him up. The Chorus speaks of him as still reigning, in reference to the fact that many oracles were supposed to be inspired by him; and suggests the thought that Agamemnon, too, in the unseen world of the dead, may yet be reigning, and so may work out vengeance on the evil-doers. Was taken in the toils of golden snare, By woman's craft, and now below the earth .... Elec. [Sobbing.] Ah me! ah me! Chor. He reigns in fullest life. Elec. Fie on it, fie. Chor. Yes, fie indeed; for she, Fell traitress .... Elec. Perished, you would say? Chor. E'en so. Elec. I know, I know it. One was left to care Amphiaraos, before leaving Argos, had charged his sons, AlcmÃ¦on and Amphilochos, to take vengeance on their mother, and this AlcmÃ¦on did. Here, as before, Sophocles refers to a subject that he himself had dramatised in his tragedy of Eriphyle. For him who suffered. None is left to me; For he who yet remained is snatched away. Chor. Most piteous thou, and piteous is thy lot. Elec. That know I well, too well, In this my life, which through the months runs on, Filled full of grievous fears, And bitter, hateful ills. Chor. We saw what thou dost mourn. Elec. Cease, cease, to lead me on Where now not one is left .... Chor. What say'st thou? What? Elec. Where not one helper comes, From all the hopes of common fatherhood And stock of noble sire. Chor. Death is the lot of all. Elec. What? Is it all men's lot In that fierce strife of speed, To fall, as he fell, by an evil fate, In severed reins entangled? Chor. Wondrous and dark that doom. Elec. I trow it was, if in a strange land, he, Without my helping hands .... Chor. Oh, horror! horror! Elec. Was buried with no sepulture from us, Nor voice of wailing. Enter Chrysothemis, running eagerly. Chrys. In pure delight, dear sister, thus I rush, My maiden grace abandoning, to come With swiftest foot; for lo! I bring great joy And respite from the ills thou long hast borne, And still did'st wail. Elec. And whence can'st thou have found Help for my woes where healing there is none? Chrys. Orestes comes at last. Count this as sure, Hearing my words, as that thou see'st me here. Elec. What! Art thou mad, poor wretch, and so dost mock At thine own sorrows, and at mine as well? Chrys. Nay! By our father's hearth, I do not speak These things in scorn, but say that he is come. Elec. Ah, wretched me! And whose word is it then That thou hast heard with such credulity? Chrys. I, of myself, no other, clearest proof Have seen, and therefore I believe this thing. Elec. What hast thou seen, poor soul; what caught thy gaze, That thou art fevered with this flameless fire? Chrys. Now by the Gods! I pray thee, list to me, That thou may'st know if I be sane or mad. Elec. Tell then thy tale, if thou find joy in it. Chrys. And I will tell each thing of all I saw; For when I came where stands our father's tomb Time-honoured, âTime-honouredâ as the sepulchre of the house of Pelops. on the summit of the mound I see the marks of flowing streams of milk New poured, and lo! my father's bier was crowned With garlands of all flowers that deck the fields; And, seeing it, I wondered, and looked round, Lest any man should still be hovering near; And when I saw that all the place was calm, I went yet nearer to the mound, and there I saw upon the topmost point of all A tress of hair, fresh severed from the head. And when poor I beheld it, in my soul A once-familiar image stirs the thought That here I saw a token true from him Whom most I love, Orestes. In my hands I take it, uttering no ill-omened cries, But straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy; And then and now I know with equal faith This precious gift can come from none but him; Whose task is this but either mine or thine? And I, I know, have had no hand in it, Nor yet hast thou; how else, when thou'rt forbid E'en to the Gods to go from 'neath this roof Except at cost of tears? Nor does her heart, Our mother's, love to do such things as these; Nor could she, doing it, have 'scaped our view. Noo! These tomb-offerings from Orestes come. Take courage, sister dear! The same drear fate Stands not for ever to the same men comrade: Till now it frowned on us; but lo! to-day Shall be of countless good the harbinger. Elec. Ah me! How much thy madness moves my pity! Chrys. What! Speak I not a thing that gives thee joy? Elec. Thou know'st not where thou art in fact or thought. Chrys. How can I not know what I clearly saw? Elec. He, thou poor soul, is dead, and with him goes All hope of safety. Think no more of him. Chrys. Ah, wretched me! From whom hast thou heard this? Elec. From one who stood hard by when he was killed. Chrys. And where is he? Strange wonder thrills through me. Elec. Within, our mother's not unwelcome guest. Chrys. Ah me! And yet what man was it that left These many offerings at my father's grave? Elec. I for my part must think that some one placed them Memorials of Orestes who is dead. Chrys. Ah me! I hastened, joyous, with my tale, Not knowing in what depths of woe we were; And now, when I have come, I find at once My former woes, with fresh ones in their train. Elec. So stands it with thee. But if thou wilt list To me, thou shalt cast off this weight of woe. Chrys. What! shall I ever bring the dead to life? Elec. I meant not that: I am not quite so mad. Chrys. What bidd'st thou, then, that I can answer for? Elec. That thou should'st dare to do what I shall bid. Chrys. Well! If it profit, I will not refuse. Elec. See! without labour nothing prospers well. Chrys. I see, and I with all my strength will work. Elec. Hear, then, what I am purposed to perform. Thou knowest, e'en thou, that we behold no more The presence of our friends, but Hades dark Has snatched them, and we twain are left alone. And I, as long as I still heard and deemed My brother strong and living, still had hopes That he would come to avenge our father's death; But now that he is gone I look to thee, That thou flinch not, with me thy sister here, From slaying him, Ãgisthos, whose hand wrought Our father's murder; for I may not hide Aught of my mind from thee. How long, how long Dost thou wait dully, looking to what hope As yet remaining, when for thee is nought But grief, as robbed of all thy father's wealth, And sorrow that thou waxest old till now, Without or marriage-bed or marriage-song? And cherish thou no hope that thou shalt gain Or this or that. Ãgisthos is not blind, To let our progeny, or mine or thine, Spring up or grow, to be his certain harm. But, if thou wilt to my advice give heed, First, thou shalt gain the praise of reverence due Both from our father, who now sleeps below, And from our brother; next, thou shalt be called, As thou wast born, free, noble, and shalt gain Befitting marriage. All men love to look On deeds of goodness. Dost not see full clear All the fair fame thou'lt gain for thee and me, If thou obey my counsels? Who, seeing us, Or citizen or stranger, will not greet us With praises such as these? âBehold, my friends, Those sisters twain, who saved their father's house, And on their foes who walked in pride of strength, Regardless of their lives, wrought doom of death! These all must love, these all must reverence; These in our feasts, and when the city meets In full assemblage, all should honour well, For this their manly prowess.â Thus will all Speak of us, so that fame we shall not miss, Living or dying. Do but hear me, dear one, Toil for thy father, for thy brother work, Free me from all my evils, free thyself, Knowing this, that living basely is for those Who have been born of noble stock most base. Chor. Forethought at such a crisis is for those Who speak and those that hear, the best ally. Chrys. And she, O women, ere she spoke, had kept (Had she not chanced to be of mind diseased) That cautious reverence which she keeps not now. What hast thou seen that thou dost arm thyself In such foolhardy rashness, and dost call On me to help thee? Wilt thou never see? Lo, thou wast born a woman, not a man, And art less strong than those thine enemies. And their good fortune prospers every day, While ours falls off, and doth to nothing come. Who, plotting to attack a man like that, Shall pass unscathed, unvexed by bitter woe? Take heed lest we who fare but badly now Should fare yet worse, if any hear thy speech; For nothing does it help or profit us, Gaining fair fame, a shameful death to die; [Yet death is not the worst, but when one seeks To die, and fails e'en that poor gain to win.] Come, I implore thee, and before thou work Our utter ruin, and our house lay waste, Restrain thine anger. What thou now hast said I will keep secret, and no ill result From this shall come. But thou, be wise at last, Powerless thyself, to yield before the strong. Chor. Yes, hearken thou! No gain that men can reap Surpasses forethought and wise-counselled mind. Elec. Thou hast said nought unlooked for. Well I knew That thou would'st none of all I urged on thee. Well! I alone, with my own hands, must do This deed: for void we will not leave it now. Chrys. Would thou had'st had this spirit then, when he, Our father, died! Great things thou then had'st wrought. Elec. My nature was the same, though weak my mind. Chrys. Strive, then, to have such mind for evermore. Elec. Thou giv'st advice as one who will not help. Chrys. 'Tis fit that they who do ill, ill should fare. Elec. I praise thy wit; thy cowardice I hate. Chrys. Soon I shall have to hear, while thou dost praise. Elec. Thou at my hands shalt never suffer that. Chrys. The long, long future must on this decide. Elec. Away! away! Thou hast no power to help. Chrys. I have; but thou hast lost the power to learn. Elec. Go, then. Tell all to that thy mother there. Chrys. I do not hate thee with a hate like that. Elec. Yet think to what a shame thou leadest me. Chrys. No, 'tis not shame, but forethought for thy good. Elec. Must I then follow what thou deemest just? Chrys. When thou art wise, then thou shalt take the lead. Elec. 'Tis strange one speaking well should err so greatly. Chrys. Thou hast said well the ill thou mak'st thine own. Elec. What? Seem I not to thee to speak the right? Chrys. There is a time when even right may harm. Elec. I do not choose to live by laws like that. Chrys. If this thou dost, thou'lt one day give me praise. Elec. And I will do it, nothing scared by thee. Chrys. And is it so? Wilt thou not change thy plans? Elec. Not so; than evil counsel nought is worse. Chrys. Thou seem'st to care for nought of all I speak. Elec. Long since I planned it; 'tis no new device. Chrys. I then must needs depart; thou darest not To praise my words, nor I these moods of thine. Elec. Go, then, within: I ne'er will follow thee, No! not though thou should'st wish it eagerly. To hunt a shadow is a madman's sport. Chrys. Nay, then! If thou dost think thou reasonest well, So reason. When thou find'st thyself in grief, Then thou wilt praise my counsels. [Exeunt Electra and Chrysothemis. Chor. Stroph. I. Why, when we see on high The birds for wisdom famed The âbirds for wisdom famedâ are here the storks. Building their nests on the roofs of houses, their habits came under men's notice, and they had come to be proverbial as presenting the pattern of filial reverence. Caring to nourish those from whom they spring, From whom they found support, Why fail we to requite Like boon on equal scale? But, lo! by Zeus' glaring lightning flash, By Themis throned on high, Not long shall we escape our chastisement. Ah, Voice that to the central depths of earth The feeling that tidings from the world of the living reached the dead in Hades was expressed in the personification of a Voice, Message, Fame, whose dwelling was below the earth, and whose function it was to bear them. Dost bear our human deeds, Lift up thy wailing speech To those of Atreus' sons who sleep below, Telling of foulest shame, Unmeet for choral song. Antistroph. I. Long since their house is sick With sorrow's pain, and now Their children's strife no more may be appeased By kindly intercourse. Electra, left alone, Sails on a troubled sea, Still wailing evermore, with piteous cry, The father whom she loved, Like nightingale whose song is fraught with woe, Nor has she any shrinking fear of death, Ready to close her eyes In darkness as of night, If only she the Erinnys pair The Erinnys pair are, of course, Clytemnestra and Ãgisthos, looked on as intensely evil, and yet the instruments of a divine vengeance. destroy. Who lives there true in soul To noble stock as she? Stroph. II. None of the great and good Would lose his ancient name, And stain his glory by a wretched life. So thou, my child, my child, did'st choose the fate, The fate which all bewail, And, having warred with ill, Did'st gain, in one brief word, The good report of daughter wise and best. Antistroph. II. May'st thou, in might and wealth, Prevail o'er those thy foes, As much as now thou liv'st beneath their hands; For I have found thee, not in high estate Wending thy way, yet still, In love and fear of Zeus, Gaining the foremost prize In all the laws that best and greatest are. Enter Orestes and Pylades, followed by two or three Attendants bearing a funeral urn. Ores. And did we then, ye women, hear aright? And do we rightly journey where we wish? Chor. What dost thou search? And wherefore art thou come? Ores. This long time past I seek Ãgisthos' home. Chor. Thou comest right, and blameless he who told thee. Ores. And which of you would tell to those within The longed-for coming of our company? Chor. [Pointing to Electra.] She, if 'tis fit to call the nearest one. Ores. Go then, O maiden, go and tell them there, That certain men from Phokis seek Ãgisthos. Elec. Ah, wretched me! It cannot be ye bring Clear proofs of that dire rumour which we heard? Ores. I know not of thy rumour; Strophios old Charged me to bring the news about Orestes. Elec. What is it, stranger? Fear creeps through my veins. Ores. We bring, as thou dost see, in one small urn, All that is left, poor relics of the dead. Elec. Ah, me! And this is it! 'Twould seem I gaze On that same burden, clear and close at hand. Ores. If thou dost weep Orestes' hapless fate, Know that this urn doth all his body hold. Elec. Ah, stranger! Now by all the Gods, I pray, If this urn hold him, give it in mine hands, That I my fate and that of all my kin May wail and weep with these poor ashes here. Ores. [To his Attendants.] Bring it, and give it her, whoe'er she be: At least she does not ask it as in hate, But is perchance a friend, or near in blood. Elec. [Taking the urn in her hands.] O sole memorial of his life whom most Of all alive I loved! Orestes mine, With other thoughts I sent thee forth than these With which I now receive thee. Now, I bear In these my hands what is but nothingness; But sent thee forth, dear boy, in bloom of youth. Ah, would that I long since had ceased to live Before I sent thee to a distant shore, With these my hands, and saved thee then from death! So had'st thou perished on that self-same day, And had a share in that thy father's tomb. But now from home, an exile in a land That was not thine, without thy sister near, So did'st thou die, and I, alas, poor me! Did neither lay thee out with lustral rites And loving hands, nor bear thee, as was meet, Sad burden, from the blazing funeral pyre; But thou, poor sufferer, tended by the hands Of strangers, comest, in this paltry urn, In paltry bulk. Ah, miserable me! For all the nurture, now so profitless, Which I was wont with sweetest toil to give For thee, my brother. Never did she love, Thy mother, as I loved thee; nor did they Who dwell within there nurse thee, but 'twas I, And I was ever called thy sister true; But now all this has vanished in a day In this thy death; for, like a whirlwind, thou Hast passed, and swept off all. My father falls; I perish; thou thyself hast gone from sight; Our foes exult. My mother, wrongly named, For mother she is none, is mad with joy, Of whom thou oft did'st send word secretly That thou would'st come and one day show thyself A true avenger. But thine evil fate, Thine and mine also, hath bereaved me of thee, And now hath sent, instead of that dear form, This dust, this shadow, vain and profitless. Woe, woe is me! O piteous, piteous corpse! Thou dearest, who did'st tread (Woe, woe is me!) Paths full of dread and fear, How hast thou brought me low, Yea, brought me very low, thou dearest one! Therefore receive thou me to this thine home, Ashes to ashes, that with thee below I may from henceforth dwell. When thou wast here I shared with thee an equal lot, and now I crave in dying not to miss thy tomb; For those that die I see are freed of grief, Chor. Thou, O Electra, take good heed, wast born Of mortal father, mortal, too, Orestes; Yield not too much to grief. To suffer thus Is common lot of all. Ores. [Trembling.] Ah, woe is me! What shall I say? Ah, whither find my way In words confused? I fail to rule my speech. Elec. What grief disturbs thee? Wherefore speak'st thou thus? Ores. Is this Electra's noble form I see? Elec. That self-same form, and sad enough its state. Ores. Alas, alas, for this sad lot of thine! Elec. Surely thou dost not wail, O friend, for me? Ores. O form most basely, godlessly misused! Elec. Thy words ill-omened fall on none but me. Ores. Alas, for this thy life of lonely woe! Elec. Why, in thy care for me, friend, groanest thou? Ores. How little knew I of my fortune's ills! Elec. What have I said to throw such light on them? Ores. Now that I see thee clad with many woes. Elec. And yet thou see'st but few of all mine ills. Ores. What could be sadder than all this to see? Elec. This, that I sit at meat with murderers. Ores. With whose? What evil dost thou mean by this? Elec. My father's; next, I 'm forced to be their slave. Ores. And who constrains thee to this loathÃ¨d task? Elec. My mother she is called, no mother like. Ores. How so? By blows, or life with hardships full? Elec. Both blows and hardships, and all forms of ill. Ores. And is there none to help, not one to check? Elec. No, none. Who was ... thou bringest him as dust. Ores. O sad one! Long I pitied as I gazed! Elec. Know, then, that thou alone dost pity me. Ores. For I alone come suffering woes like thine. Elec. What? Can it be thou art of kin to us? Ores. If these are friendly, I could tell thee more. Elec. Friendly are they; thou'lt speak to faithful ones. Ores. Put by that urn, that thou may'st hear the whole. Elec. Ah, by the Gods, O stranger, ask not that. Ores. Do what I bid thee, and thou shalt not err. Elec. Nay, by thy beard, of that prize rob me not. Ores. I may not have it so. Elec. Ah me, Orestes, How wretched I, bereaved of this thy tomb! Ores. Hush, hush such words: thou hast no cause for wailing. Elec. Have I no cause, who mourn a brother's death? Ores. Thou hast no call to utter speech like this. Elec. Am I then deemed unworthy of the dead? Ores. Of none unworthy. This is nought to thee. Elec. Yet if I hold Orestes' body here. Ores. 'Tis not Orestes' save in show of speech. Elec. Where, then, is that poor exile's sepulchre? Ores. Nay, of the living there's no sepulchre. Elec. What say'st thou, boy? Ores. No falsehood what I say. Elec. And does he live? Ores. He lives, if I have life. Elec. What? Art thou he? Ores. Look thou upon this seal, My father's once, and learn if I speak truth. Elec. O blessed light! Ores. Most blessed, I too own. Elec. O voice! And art thou come? Ores. No longer learn Thy news from others. Elec. And I have thee here, Here in my grasp? Ores. So may'st thou always have me! Elec. O dearest friends, my fellow-citizens, Look here on this Orestes, dead indeed In feignÃ¨d craft, and by that feigning saved. Chor. We see it, daughter; and at what has chanced A tear of gladness trickles from our eyes. Elec. O offspring, offspring of a form most dear, Ye came, ye came at last, Ye found us, yea, ye came, Ye saw whom ye desired. Ores. Yes, we are come. Yet wait and hold thy peace. Elec. What now? Ores. Silence is best, lest some one hear within. Elec. Nay, nay. By Artemis, The ever-virgin One, I shall not deign to dread Those women there within, With worthless burden still Cumbering the ground. Ores. See to it, for in women too there lives The strength of battle. Thou hast proved it well. Elec. [Sobbing.] Ah, ah! Ah me! There thou hast touched upon a woe unveiled, That knows no healing, no, Nor ever may be hid. Ores. I know it well. But, when occasion bids, Then should we call those deeds to memory. Elec. All time for me is fit, Yea, all, to speak of this, With wrath as it deserves; Till now I had scant liberty of speech. Ores. There we are one. Preserve, then, what thou hast. Elec. And what, then, shall I do? Ores. When time serves not, Speak not o'ermuch. Elec. And who then worthily, Now thou art come, would choose Silence instead of speech? For lo! I see thee now unlooked, unhoped for. Ores. Then thou did'st see me here, When the Gods urged my coming. Elec. Thou hast said What mounts yet higher than thy former boon, If God has sent thee forth To this our home; I deem The work as Heaven's own deed. Ores. Loth am I to restrain thee in thy joy, And yet I fear delight o'ermasters thee. Elec. O thou who after many a weary year At last hast deigned to come, (Oh, coming of great joy!) Do not, thus seeing me Involved in many woes, ... Ores. What is it that thou ask'st me not to do? Elec. Deprive me not, nor force me to forego The joy supreme of looking on thy face. Ores. I should be wroth with others who would force thee. Elec. Dost thou consent, then? Ores. How act otherwise? Elec. Ah, friends, I heard a voice Which never had I dreamt would come to me; Then I kept in my dumb and passionate mood, Nor cried I, as I heard; But now I have thee; thou hast come to me With face most precious, dear to look upon, Which e'en in sorrow I can ne'er forget. Ores. All needless words pass over. Tell me not My mother's shame, nor how Ãgisthos drains My father's wealth, much wastes, and scatters much; Much speech might lose occasion's golden hour; But what fits in to this our present need, That tell me, where, appearing or concealed, We best shall check our boasting enemies, In this our enterprise; so when we twain Go to the palace, look to it, that she note not, Thy mother, by thy blither face, our coming, But mourn as for that sorrow falsely told. When we have prospered, then shalt thou have leave Freely to smile, and joy exultingly. Elec. Yes, brother dear! Whatever pleaseth thee, That shall be my choice also, since my joy I had not of mine own, but gained from thee, Nor would I cause thee e'en a moment's pain, Myself to reap much profit. I should fail, So doing, to work His will who favours us. What meets us next, thou knowest, dost thou not? Ãgisthos, as thou hearest, gone from home; My mother there within, of whom fear not Lest she should see my face look blithe with joy; For my old hatred eats into my soul, And, since I've seen thee, I shall never cease To weep for very joy. How could I cease, Who in this one short visit looked on thee Dead, and alive again? Strange things to-day Hast thou wrought out, so strange that should there come My father, in full life, I should not deem 'Twas a mere marvel, but believe I saw him. But, since thou com'st on such an enterprise, Rule thou as pleases thee. Were I alone, I had not failed of two alternatives, Or nobly had I saved myself, or else Had nobly perished. Ores. Silence now is best; I hear the steps of some one from within, As if approaching. Enter Attendant of Orestes from the palace. Elec. [Aloud.] Enter in, my friends, On many grounds, and chiefly that ye bring, What none will send away, yet none receive With any touch of pleasure. Attend. O ye fools, And blind, bereaved of counsel, care ye now No longer for your lives? or is there not Your mother-wit still with you? Know ye not Ye standâI say not on the very verge, But in the illsâthe greatest ills themselves? Had I not chanced long since to keep my watch Just at the gate, your doings had been known There, in the house, before your forms were seen. But, as it is, I guarded against this; And now, set free from all this flood of talk, Free from this girl's insatiate burst of joy, Go ye within. In such a deed delay Is evil, and 'tis time to end with it. Ores. How stand things there for me to go within? Attend. Right well! for none is found who knows thee there. Ores. 'Twould seem that thou hast told of me as dead. Attend. Know thou art here as one to Hades gone. Ores. Do they rejoice in this? What words were said? Attend. When all is o'er, I'll tell thee. As it is, All is well with them, even what is ill. Elec. Who is this, brother? Tell me, by the Gods. Ores. Dost thou not know? Elec. I call him not to mind. Ores. Know'st thou not him whose hands thou gav'st me to? Elec. To whom? What say'st thou? Ores. Even he, who brought me, Through thy wise forethought, to the Phokian plain. Elec. What? Is this he, whom only, out of many, I faithful found when they our father slew? Ores. 'Tis he: waste no more words in questioning. Elec. O blessed light, O thou preserver sole Of Agamemnon's house, how cam'st thou here? And art thou he who then did rescue him And me from many sorrows? O dear hands, And thou that did'st thy feet's glad ministry, How was it that so long thou stayed'st with me, And yet did'st 'scape my ken, did'st not appear, But did'st in words destroy me, bringing acts Most full of joy? Hail, O my father, hail, (For sure, I think I see a father's face,) Hail, once again, and know that this one day Above all men I hated thee and loved. Attend. This is enough, methinks. What lies between Full many a day and many a circling night Shall show thee plain, Electra. But you twain, There standing by, I call to act, for now The time is come. Now Clytemnestra sits Alone. Now no man is within. Think well, If ye hold back, that ye will have to fight With these and others craftier far than they. Ores. No longer is it time for lengthened speech, My Pylades, but with swift foot to press Within, when first we have adored the shrines Of all the ancestral Gods who guard these gates. [Exeunt Orestes and Pylades into the palace. Elec. O King Apollo, hear them graciously, And hear me also, who of what I had Have stood before thee with a liberal hand; And now Lykeian king, Apollo, hear; With all I have I kneel, pray, supplicate; Be Thou the gracious helper of our plans, And show to all men how the Gods bestow Their due rewards on all impiety. [Exit. Chor. Stroph. See ye, where Ares, breathing slaughter still, Speeds on his onward way, Slaughter that none may check; E'en at this very hour, beneath the roof, They go who track all evil deeds of guile, The hounds whom none escape; And lo! my soul's dream doth not tarry long, Floating in wild suspense; Antistroph. For now beneath the roof-tree he has passed, The avenger of the dead, Treading with subtle feet, E'en to his father's high ancestral halls, And in his hands bears slaughter newly edged; And Hermes, Maia's son, Hiding their counsel, leads them to the goal, Leads on, and tarries not. Enter Electra from the palace. Elec. Now, dearest friends, the men stand there within, And do their deed. But hush: in silence wait. Chor. How is't? What do they? Elec. She prepares an urn For sepulture, and those two stand hard by. Chor. Why did'st thou rush without? Elec. To stand on guard, That so Ãgisthos, if he home return, May not escape our notice. Clytem. [Within.] Woe! oh, woe! O house bereaved of friends, And full of them that slay! Elec. A cry goes up within; friends, hear ye not? Chor. I heard what none should hear, ah misery! And shuddered listening. Clytem. [Within.] Ah me! Ah me! Woe, Woe! Ãgisthos, where art thou? Elec. Ha! List again, I hear a bitter cry. Clytem. [Within.] My son, my son, Have pity on thy mother! Elec. Thou had'st none On him, nor on the father that begat him. Chor. O land! O miserable race! Thy doom Each day is âperish, perish utterly.â Clytem. [Within.] Ah! I am smitten. Elec. Smite her yet again, If thou hast strength for it. Clytem. [Within.] Ah! Blow on blow! Elec. Would that Ãgisthos shared them. Chor. Yes. The curse Is now fulfilled. The buried live again; For they who died long since now drain in turn The blood of those that slew them. Enter Orestes and Pylades. See! They come; And lo! their crimsoned hands drip drops of gore Poured out to Ares; and I dare not blame. Elec. How fare ye now, Orestes? Ores. All within Is well, if well Apollo prophesied. Elec. And is she dead, vile wretch? Ores. Yes. Fear thou not Thy mother's mood shall e'er shame thee again. Chor. Hush! for I see Ãgisthos full in sight. Elec. Back, back, ye boys! [Thrusts Orestes and Pylades behind the scene. Ores. [As he goes.] And see ye where this man ...? Elec. He from the suburbs comes upon us now, Rejoicing. Chor. Go, full speed, behind the doors, That ye, one work well done, may yet again .... Ores. Take courage, we will act .... Elec. Now speed thy plans. [Pushing him off. Ores. I then am gone. [Exeunt Orestes and Pylades. Elec. What meets us next is mine. Chor. 'Twere good to speak to this man in his ear But few words, very gently, that he rush Into the hidden struggle of his doom. Enter Ãgisthos. Ãgis. Who knows of you where they, from Phokis come, May now be found, who bring, they tell me, news That our Orestes has breathed out his last, In wreck of chariot-storm? Thee, [To Electra,] thee, I askâ Yes, thee, still wont to be of old so brave. As I suppose it touches thee the most, So thou, knowing most, may'st tell me what I seek. Elec. I know. How else? Could I then stand aloof From that dear chance of those who most are mine? Ãgis. Where are the strangers, then? Tell this to me. Elec. Within; for they have found a loving hostess. Ãgis. And did they say distinctly he was dead? Elec. Ah no! They showed him, not in words alone. Ãgis. And is he here, that we may see him plain? Elec. 'Tis here, a most unwelcome sight to see. Ãgis. Against thy wont thou giv'st me joy indeed. Elec. Thou may'st rejoice, if this be ground of joy. Ãgis. I bid you hush, and open wide the gates, That all of Argos and MykenÃ¦ see. So, if there be that once were lifted up, With hopes they had, vain hopes they fixed on him, Now seeing him dead, they may receive my curb, And, finding me their master, sense may gain, Without coercion. Elec. Yea, my task indeed Is done; for I at last have wisdom gained, To work with those more mighty. [The doors are thrown open, and disclose Orestes and Pylades standing by the dead body of Clytemnestra, covered with a sheet and a veil over the face. Ãgis. Lo, I see, O Zeus, a form that lies there, fallen low, Not without wrath of Heaven (should that word stir Heaven's jealousy, I wish it all unsaid.) Withdraw the veil which hides the face, that I To kindred blood may pay the meed of tears. Ores. Do thou uplift it. 'Tis thy task, not mine, To look on this, and kindly words to speak. Ãgis. Thou giv'st good counsel, and I list to thee: And thou, if yet she tarries in the house, Call Clytemnestra. Ores. [As Ãgisthos lifts the veil.] Here she lies before thee! Seek her not elsewhere. Ãgis. Oh, what sight is this! Ores. Whom fearest thou? Who is't thou dost not know? Ãgis. Into whose snares, whose closely-tangled mesh, Have I, poor victim, fallen? Ores. See'st not yet That thou did'st greet the living as the dead? Ãgis. Ah me! I catch thy words. It needs must be This is Orestes who now speaks to me. Ores. Wert thou then tricked, who dost divine so well? Ãgis. I then am lost, woe's me! yet let me speak One little word. Elec. Give him no leave to speak, By all the Gods, my brother, nor to spin His long discourse. When men are plunged in ills, What gain can one who stands condemned to die Reap from delay? No, slay him out of hand, And, having slain him, cast him forth, to find Fit burial at their hands from whom 'tis meet That he should have it, far away from view. Thus only shall I gain a remedy For all the evils of the years gone by. Ores. [To Ãgisthos.] Go thou within, and quickly. Now our strife Is not of words, but for thy life itself. Ãgis. Why dost thou force me in? If this be right, What need of darkness? Why not slay at once? Ores. Give thou no orders, but where thou did'st slay My father, go, that thou too there may'st die. Ãgis. Is it then doomed this house should see the ills Of Pelops' line, both present and to come? Ores. Yes, thine: of that, at least, I'm prophet true. Ãgis. The skill thou boastest came not from thy sire. Ores. Still thou dost bandy many idle words, And length'nest out the way. Move on. Ãgis. Lead thou. Ores. Not so. Thou must go first. Ãgis. Dost think I'll flee? Ores. Thou must not die the death thou would'st desire; I needs must make it bitter. Doom like this Should fall on all who dare transgress the laws, The doom of death. Then wickedness no more Would multiply its strength. Chor. O seed of Atreus, after many woes, Thou hast come forth, thy freedom hardly won, By this emprise made perfect!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX OF RHYMED CHORAL ODES AND LYRICAL DIALOGUES. 86â250.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Electra. O holy light of morn! O air that dost the whole earth compass round! Oft have ye heard my cries of grief forlorn, And oft the echoing sound Of blows the breast that smite, When darkness yields to light; And for my nightly vigils they know well, Those loathÃ¨d couches of my hated home, How I upon my father's sorrows dwell; To whom in no strange land did Ares come, Breathing out slaughter dread; But she, my mother, and her paramour, Ãgisthos, smote him dead With axe of murderous power; As men who timber hew Cut down a lofty oak, so him they slew; And from none else but me Comes touch of sympathy, Though thou wast doomed to die, My father, with such shame and foulest ignominy. And, lo! I will not fail To weep and mourn with wailings and with sighs, While yet I see the bright stars in the skies, Or watch the daylight glad,â No, no, I will not fail, Like sorrowing nightingale, Before the gate to pour my sorrows free, My woe and sorrow at my father's doom. O house of Hades and Persephone, O Hermes, guide of dwellers in the gloom, Thou, awful Curse, and ye, Erinnyes, daughters of the Gods, most dread, Whose eyes for ever see Men foully slain, and those whose marriage bed The lust of evil guile Doth stealthily defile, Come, come, avengers of my father's fate! Come, send my brother back! For I the courage lack, Alone to bear the burden of this evil weight. Chorus. Stroph. I. O child, Electra, child Of mother doomed to all extremest ill, Why thus in wailing wild Dost thou unceasing pour thy sorrows still For him who, long ago, Caught in thy mother's base and godless cheat, Fell by the fatal blow, Our chieftain, Agamemnon? Yea, may he Who planned this vile deceit (If so to speak is meet) Perish most wretchedly! Electra. O daughters of the brave and true of heart, Ye come to comfort me in all my woe; I know your love, yea, know its every part; And yet I have no wish to stop the flow Of tears and wailings for my ill-starred sire; But, O my friends, who meet, With true affection, all my heart's desire, Suffer me thus, I pray, To pine and waste away. Chorus. Antistroph. I. And yet thou can'st not raise Thy father, nor with wailing nor with prayer, From Hades' darkling ways, And gloomy lake where all that die repair; But thou, thus grieving still, Dost pass, brought low, from evil one might bear To that worst form of ill, In which for deepest woe is no relief. Ah me! why striv'st thou so For such increase of woe, Still adding to my grief? Electra. Ah, weak as infant he who can forget His parents that have perished wretchedly; Far more she pleaseth me that mourneth yet, And âItys, Itys,â wails unceasingly; The bird heart-broken, messenger of Heaven. Ah, Niobe, most sad! To thee, I deem, high fate divine was given, For thou in cavern grot, Still weeping, ceasest not. Chorus. Stroph. II. Ah, not for thee alone Of mortal race hath come the taste of woes. What cause hast thou above those twain to moan, In whom the self-same blood of kindred flows, Iphianassa and Chrysothemis? And one in youth obscure and sad doth live, Yet blest, at least, in this, That unto him MykenÃ¦ famed shall give Its welcome as the son of noble sire, Beneath the care of Zeus' almighty hand, Returning once again, Orestes, to our land. Electra. Yes, he it is for whom I waste away, Wailing for him, in vain, unweariedly; And in my sorrow know no bridal day, But weep sad tears from eyelids never dry, Bearing my endless weight Of dark and dreary fate: And he remembers not All that I did for him, and all he knew. What message comes, yea, what, That is not cheated of fulfilment true? He yearneth still for home; Yet yearning will not come. Chorus. Antistroph. II. Take heart, my child, take heart; Still mighty in the heavens Zeus doth reign, Who sees the whole world, rules its every part: To Him do thou commit thy bitter pain, Nor be thou over-vexÃ¨d, nor forget Those whom thou hatest sorely evermore; Time is a kind God yet; For neither he who dwells on Crisa's shore, Where feed the oxen, Agamemnon's son, Unheeding, there lives on; Nor yet the God who reigns By Acheron's waters o'er his dark and drear domains. Electra. Nay, but the larger half of life is gone, And all hope fails, and I no more can bear; No parents left, I waste my days alone, And no true husband guardeth me from fear; Like one of alien race, I, in my sore disgrace, My father's chambers tend, In this unsightly and unseemly dress, And still as slave attend, And wait on tables in my sore distress, Tables that empty stand, No friends on either hand. Chorus. Stroph. III. Sad was thy father's cry, When home he came, and sad when, as he lay, The stern, keen blow came nigh Of brazen hatchet sharp to smite and slay; Guile was it that devised the murderous crime, And lust that slew him there, Strangely strange form begetting of old time; Whether a God it were, Or one of mortal race, Who wrought these deeds of darkness and disgrace. Electra. O day of all the days that ever came, Most hateful unto me! O night! O woes of banquets none may name, Which he, my sire, did see! Foul death which their hands wrought, The two that took by basest treachery Him who my life's joy brought, And so destroyed, destroyed me utterly. May He who dwells in might, On yon Olympian height, Give them to grieve with guilt-avenging groan, And ne'er may they whose souls such deeds have known Share in good fortune bright! Chorus. Antistroph. III. Take heed, and speak no more; Hast thou no thought from what high, prosperous state Thou now art passing o'er, Into what sorrow lorn and desolate? For thou hast gained a burden infinite Of woe and wretchedness, Still cherishing thy wrath in sore despite, Fierce war and bitterness; And yet it were ill done To come in conflict with a mighty one. Electra. By sufferings dire, most dire, I was constrained: I know it, wrath blinds not; And yet I will not hide, though direly pained, The misery of my lot, Not while in life I dwell. Ah me! from whom, my friends, companions dear, From whom that thinketh well, Shall I a word in season hope to hear? O ye, who fain would cheer, Leave me, oh, leave me here, For these my woes as endless shall be known; Nor will I cease to make my wailing moan, And weep full many a tear. Chorus. And yet of mere good will, As mother fond and true, I bid thee this vain toil no more pursue, Still breeding ill on ill. Electra. Nay; but what bounds are set to baseness here? Come, tell me this, I pray, How can it e'er be right Those who are dead to slight? Where did that law appear? May I ne'er walk in honour in their way, Nor if aught good be mine, Dwell with it happily, Should I the wings confine That rise with bitter cry, And bid them cease to pay Due reverence to my father past away! If he who dies be but as dust and nought, And poor and helpless lie, And these no vengeance meet for what they wrought, Then truly awe will die, And all men lose their natural piety. 472â515.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Chorus. Strophe. Unless I be a brainstruck, erring seer, Wanting in wisdom true, Right doth her course pursue, With dim foreshadowing: She in her hands doth righteous victory bring, And will ere long appear. Yes, courage comes to me, Hearing but now the tidings that they bring, These visions breathing forth sweet hope and glee. For never shall thy father, Lord and King Of all the Hellenes' race, Forget the dire disgrace, Nor that sharp brazen axe of yon far time, Which slew him with all shame of foulest crime. Antistrophe. And so with many a foot and many a hand, Lurking in ambush dread, Shall come with brazen tread, Erinnys terrible; For lo! the clasp of blood-stained marriage-bed Came in foul wedlock's band On those who might not wed; And now, in face of these things, I must deem That those who did or shared the deed of guilt Shall have good reason to mislike their dream: Yea, oracles are vain, In dreams or prophet's strain, Unless this shadowy phantom of the night Shall reach its goal, victorious in the right. Epode. O chariot-race of old, Full of great woe untold, From Pelops' hand; How did'st thou come, yon time, Dark with the guilt of crime, To this our land! For since the ocean wave Gave Myrtilos a grave, Out of the golden car Hurled headlong forth afar, With shame and foul despite, No shame hath failed to light On this our dwelling-place, Bringing most foul disgrace. 1058â1096.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Why, when we see on high The birds whose wisdom is of noblest worth, Still caring to supply The wants of those from whom they had their birth, Who fed their nestling youth, Why do not we like boon with like requite? Nay, by the lightning bright Of Zeus, and heavenly strength of Law and Truth, Not long shall we live on unpunishÃ¨d. O Fame! for us poor mortals wont to bear Thy tidings to the region of the dead, Lift up thy wailing drear, And to the AtreidÃ¦, as they sleep below, Report the shame, the discord, and the woe. Antistroph. I. Tell them those ills of old, yea, tell again, And add that now the hot and bitter strife Of these their children twain Yields to no charm of fellowship in life. Electra, now forlorn, Deserted sails upon a stormy sea, And in her misery, Her father's fortune ceaseth not to mourn, Like nightingale that waileth evermore; She little recks if death be in the way, And stands prepared to sleep and wake no more, If only she those two Erinnyes slay: Who of all souls that are, with her can vie For fair repute of filial loyalty? Stroph. II. No, none of all that boast a noble fame Would wish his fair repute to stain and spot, By living basely, stript of honoured name; And thou, my child, did'st choose thy dreary lot, Thine evil lot, bewept with many a tear, Arming against the thing that right defies; And these two glories in one word dost bear Known as true daughter, excellent and wise. Antistroph. II. Ah, may'st thou live and be as much above Thy foes in might and wealth as now below Thou dwellest ruled by those thou can'st not love! For I have seen thee on thy sad path goâ No pleasant pathway thatâbut gaining still The meed of praise for all the holiest laws, Which highest place in heavenly order fill, By this thy reverence winning God's applause.</field>
