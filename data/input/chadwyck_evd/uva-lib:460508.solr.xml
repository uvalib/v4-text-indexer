      <field name="fulltext">HENRY TALBOT. A DRAMATIC SCENE. They who are acquainted with the neighbourhood of Marlow, may perhaps recognise Seymour Court as the scene of this little drama. It is scarcely necessary to say that the characters and the story are altogether fictitious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Henry Talbot. Sir Francis Mordaunt. Eleanor, Talbot's Sister. Louisa, his Ward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, An elegant Drawing-room, with windows to the ground, opening on a Terrace, ornamented with roses, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eleanor and Mordaunt entering. Eleanor. Sir Francis Mordaunt, to a mournful house I bid you welcome! But you bring us comfortâ His truest friend, his dearest! only you Would he rejoice to see. When I first heard Your late return from Italy, there rushed Over my heart a gladness, a strange feeling, That glowed like hope. Mordaunt. This is a sad, sweet welcome. He is no better, then? Eleanor. Oh, no! Mordaunt. And what Is his disease? Eleanor. A settled melancholy, That doth consume his body; a decay Even at the noble heart. Mordaunt. The cause? Eleanor. I know not. Mordaunt. Oh, it must be some rooted malady That works thus in him! Never can I join Sadness and Henry Talbot. When we parted, One little year ago, I gazed on him As he stood on the sea beach, in all the pride Of youth and manly beauty, his bright glance Pursuing the swift vessel, and I thought, If ever happiness find rest on earth, She dwells in that fine form. High birth, high fortune, High talent, high pursuit, the general praise, The general love,âfor his sweet graciousness Commanded hearts,âand, better still than this, Domestic bliss, affection, friendship, love, And such a power to feel and give delight; Such deep humanity, such a fine sense Of beauty and of virtue! Set aside His one infirmity of sudden anger, As suddenly forgotten and redeemed By instant penitence and generous shame, And he might be the ideal of a man, The standard all look up to. Eleanor. Such he was: You paint him to the life. How proud was Iâ Too proudâof that dear brother! You will find A sadly altered man. Mordaunt. He used to be The very model of true cheerfulness; A gay and open spirit, which did feed Upon its own pure thoughts. All mirth, all smiles! Eleanor. He hath forgot to smile. Mordaunt. Withal so kindâ So exquisitely kind! Eleanor. That he is still; Kindness and he are so incorporate, That death alone can part them. My dear brother! Mordaunt. Such love as thine would once have soothed all ills. How long hath this change been. Eleanor. Oh, many months! Ever since that summer evening on the Thamesâ That fatal August evening,âwhen their boat Upset, and Lionel Grey, his foster-brother, Was most unhappily drown'd. My brother, too, Striving in vain to save him, almost lost His life. He dived for the corse, and with the corse Was brought out motionless. A fever follow'dâ A fever on the brain:âOh the black horrors Of that long dream! Those horrors passed away! But a dark cloud remains. Mordaunt. The consequence Of a long fever. He must change the scene; Must woo the sweet breath of the south; must go To lovely Italy. I will return With him, with you. Eleanor. Nought can persuade him hence; And surelyâ(it is terrible to say, To think, to feel!)âtoo surely this disease Is of the mind, the heart. Something doth weighâ Thou art my brother's friend, and I to thee Speak as a brotherâsomethingâoh, it breaks My heart to think of it! Mordaunt. I'd stake my life That he is blameless. Eleanor. Just so have I felt A thousand times. But then he speaks wild words, And my wild fearâoh, free me from that fear, And I will worship thee! And comfort him, I do beseech thee, comfort him, whate'erâ Do not desert him, evenâI cannot speak: But love him! Comfort him! Forsake him not! Mordaunt. Never. But his best comforters must be His sisterâand one other. Dare I ask, Was there not one still dearer, whose true love, Whose faith, whose sympathyâI mean his ward, The lovely orphan, his bethrothed bride. Eleanor. Poor, poor Louisa! Yes, she still is here. Poor, poor Louisa! Mordaunt. Eighteen months have passed Since I last saw her. Never did I see A maid so sweet, so fair, so delicate, Or so devotedâliving in his smiles, As the butterfly in the sunbeam. And so young, So made for peace and rest and happiness, As if she were herself some airy creature, Whom the first storm would shatter. Through this grief What hath sustained her? Eleanor. The deceiver. hope. She watches Henry's cheek, and if a flush Of the bright treacherous hectic chance to cross it, Then is she happy; hangs upon his words; And if one flash burst from the clouded spiritâ One tone of the old loveâpoor, poor Louisa! Would that she were afraid! When it does come, The stroke will kill her. Mordaunt. Have you then no hope? Eleanor. Hark! That's his step. Nay, do not rush to meet him; He cannot bear surprise.âHark to that step, So slow, so feeble! He is pausing now For breath. Alas! alas! is not that step The very knell of hope? Enter Talbot. Here is our friend, Brother! Mordaunt. Dear Talbot! Talbot. Mordaunt, this is kindâ Too kind! Eleanor. First let us place you on your couch; Then will we join to thank this kindest friend For his kind visit. Henry, he is come To nurse you, to usurp my office, Henry. Mordaunt. Rather to share it with you. Dearest Talbot, You must be well. Talbot. Oh this is kind, too kind! I am not worthy, I was never worthy Of such a friend. And nowâoh go! go! go! Fly me! Mordaunt. And wherefore? Talbot. Why, to have thee stay Would be a joyâand joy is not for me. Forgive me, Mordaunt; I am sick and waywardâ Sick at my soulâbut it will soon be o'er. Eleanor. I will not have thee talk so; good my brother, This is no gentle welcomeâ (Advancing towards the window with Mordaunt, and speaking to him apart.) For a while Seem not to observe him. This strong passion then Will pass away. Mordaunt. Is't frequent? Eleanor. Yes. (aloud) Sir Francis, Your coming is well timed. Do you remember, When you last honor'd us, 'twas at the close Of a most glorious autumn. Our beech woods Own'd every tint of gold, from deepest red To palest yellow. Often would you praise Their woodland beauty, and as often I With a proud boastful spirit bade you come And gaze on them in May, and see the sunbeams Wandering across them, with such wondrous charm Of light and shadow, bringing into life The unspeakable beauty of their fresh green tops. This is the very height and prime of May:â Said the proud boaster sooth? Go to yon windowâ Look on the distant woods. Mordaunt. To me this view Is always lovely; loveliest as it is, Whate'er the season. This smooth sloping lawn, Sprinkled with odorous shrubs, suddenly sinking Into a steepness so abrupt; the hills Sweeping away so finely; and between, Deep in the bottom, the gay pretty town, Mingled with trees and gardens; the church spire Lifting its white and taper head amidst The woody heights that bound the various scene; And underneath those woods, round that fair town, Between those hills, the ever-winding Thamesâ Talbot. Ah! Mordaunt. Glides, like a glittering snake,â Talbot. Oh true! true! true! Mordaunt. Coyly, by snatches, at rare intervals Seen, but diffusing a perpetual sense Of his bright presenceâprince of streams! Talbot. Oh fatal! Mordaunt (to Eleanor). Alas! is that the grief? Talbot. Oh fatal! fatal! Fatal as man's wild passions, as the worm That never dies! The mirror where black thoughts And blacker deedsâWhat have I said? Eleanor. My Henry, Art thou in pain? Did'st call me? Would'st thou aught? No, did'st thou say? Well, I will leave thee, Henry! (Apart to Mordaunt.) Approach him not:âalone he will o'ermaster The pang that shakes him. Make as though you heard Nought that he says. Talk on. Mordaunt. My heart is full. Eleanor. And mineâOh God! But I have learnt this sad Hypocrisy, this necessary hardness. See, he is calmer! I beseech you, talkâ He listensâ(Aloud). Then you grant that May is fair Even as October in our prospect here? Mordaunt. The picture is as bright. And yet I miss The autumnal beauty of this arching roof Of trellis, richly hung with clustering vines, Tendrils and leaves and fruit, a gorgeous frame For the fair picture. Sweet it was to gazeâ And sweet it is. You look down on the world From this calm seat, as from her lofty nest The ring dove. Talbot. Ay, it is an apt resemblance, My own sweet sister bird. Eleanor. Nay, dearest brother, My nest should be more lowly; I would build On the ground, and look still upward. There's a farm Close byâoh we must show it you, Sir Francisâ Which is almost my envy. And it is The prettiest walk! Through a beech-wood the path, A wild, rude copse-road, winds, beneath the light And feathery stems of the young trees, so fresh In their new delicate green, and so contrasting With their slim, flexile forms, that almost seem To bend as the wind passes, with the firm Deep-rooted vigor of those older trees, And nobler,âthose grey giants of the woods, That stir not at the tempest. Oh! that path Is pleasant, with its beds of richest moss, And tufts of fairest flowers, fragrant woodroof So silver white, wood-sorrel elegant, Or light anemone. A pleasant path Is that; with such a sense of freshness round us, Of cool and lovely light; the very air Has the hue of the young leaves. Downward the road Winds till beneath a beech, whose slender stem Seems toss'd across the path, all suddenly The close wood ceases, and a steep descent Leads to a valley, whose opposing side Is crown'd with answering woods; a narrow valley Of richest meadow land, which creeps half up The opposite hill; and in the midst a farm, With its old ample orchard, now one flush Of fragrant bloom; and just beneath the wood, Close by the house, a rude deserted chalk-pit, Half full of rank and creeping plants, with briars And pendent roots of trees half covered o'er, Like some wild shaggy ruin. Beautiful To me is that lone farm. There is a peace, A deep repose, a silent harmony Of nature and of man. The circling woods Shut out all human eyes; and the gay orchard Spreads its sweet world of blossoms, all unseen, Save by the smiling sky. That were a spot To live and die in. Mordaunt. Beautiful it must be; But fancy makes the charms she tells, as the sunbeams, Tenderly wandering o'er those distant woods, Bring out their exquisite tints. Eleanor. Nay, if you doubtâ Brother, the sun and air to-day are join'd In a rare compact; 'tis the warmth of June, With April's balmy breath. Come forth, dear Henry! We'll put my poney in the garden-chair, And soon convert this unbeliever. Come! It will revive you. Let us lead him thither. You will enjoy this air. Talbot. I am not worthy To breathe it, Eleanor. That innocent joy Belongs to the innocent. Eleanor. Nay, you must come. I'll call Louisa, and prepare the chaise. You will not fail us, Henry? [Exit Eleanor. Mordaunt. Beautiful Is sisterly love; divinely beautiful In yonder noble maid. How firm, how gentle, How like the purity of some old marble Is she in form and mind! Even her young beauty, The very language of her lofty brow, Is queen-like, till she bends to speak to thee, With such affectionate softness, and a look So touchingly sweet. Alas! I have no sister. How blest ye are together! Talbot. Blest we were; But nowâthe word is mockery; yet we were Once blest. You know that we were twins and orphans Alone in the wide world, and all the world To one another. I so proud of her! And she so fond of me! Mordaunt. You still so proud; She still so fond. Talbot. Ay; but the joy is gone, Once we were call'd alike: look on me now, And look on her. A red and withering hand Hath past over my youth, and turn'd my blood To fire. Her care, her grief, her misery, Am I. 'Twill soon be past. Mordaunt. Nay, you must live For that twin sister's sake; to pay her care; To bless her love. Talbot. I have no right to love; I am infected. That which was my bliss Is now my punishment. I have no right To kindness, hers or yours; or that of one Whose deeper tenderness doth pierce my heart As with a dagger. One so patiently, So exquisitely true; so trusting, yet So fearful; all made up of the fond hope That trembling sits and smiles. What agony To look upon that smile, and watch that hope, And know how false, how hollow! I've deserved Even that bitterest drop. Mordaunt. This is, indeed, A sickness of the soul. Henry, we two Have been, from boy to youth, from youth to man, Friends; not of such as borrow friendship's name To gild the flimsy band that knits gay striplings In light companionship, or the politic league Of subtle selfish man; but friends of the old Heroic cast, such as forbear, and bear, And serve, and love, and die, and trust their lives To the proved faith of friendship. Talbot. Such we were, And if a spirit so fallenâ Mordaunt. Such we are; And being such, I do conjure thee, Henry, By that old friendship, by the gushing tears Which fill'd our eyes at meeting, by the love Which even now is working in our breasts, Confide in me. Disclose the fatal secret Which weighs upon your soul. Talbot. What! cast the shade Of guilt on thy white honour? Tell to thee, To thee that deadlyâNever! never! never! Here let it die!âHere! here! Even though it swell My heart to bursting. Mordaunt. Henry, you are ill; And your sick fancy in the wayward mood, Turns error into crime. A purer mind, A nobler heart, and, set aside the rare And momentary flash of sudden wrath, A kinder temperâ Talbot. Momentary! Ay, So is the thunderbolt. Mordaunt. I do implore, Even as I would sue for present life, Brood not upon this tale. Or tell it me, Or chase it from thy memory. Talbot. Listen, then, Since thou wilt share the load,âsince thou wilt wrest The murderer's story, listen! Mordaunt. Murderer! Talbot. Why, I have said it. Didst thou think that I Was dying for some trivial larcenyâ Some poor man's common crime? Sir, thou shalt find I am a braver villain! Mordaunt. Talk not thus. I pray you, talk not thus. Be calm! Be calm! Talbot. And he would still a breaking heart with words, As Canute talk'dâHe weeps! Forgive me, friend! Truest and best, and dearest, pardon me! For I am near bestraught with misery, And know not what I say. Forgive me, Mordaunt, And listen. Didst thou e'erâFirst reach that water, And sit down here by me; for I must speak Names that will shake my very soul, and then The voice may falter. Interrupt me not; For I have now a passing hour of strength, A gleam of parting light, and I would fain Pour into thy kind bosom my remorse, My agony. So! Did you ever see Lionel Grey? Mordaunt. Never. Talbot. Nor his dear mother, The widow Grey? Mordaunt. Your nurse? That kindest woman! Often. Talbot. She was, indeed, the kindest woman, The simplest, gentlest, sweetest-spirited woman That ever trod the earth;âmy foster-mother, Who look'd around on all her little world With the indulgent softness that she felt For the infant at her breast; for me, whom most She loved; for me, who most loved her; my refuge In every childish grief, the joyful sharer Of every childish joy! Oh how I loved That dear and smiling face, made beautiful By the warm heart, and the soft pleasant voice That never spake but true and gentle words! That neverâShe is dead! And Iânay, fear notâ This pang will pass away. She had a son, An only child;âthe milk which nourish'd me Was stolen from him.âPoor Lionel! so soon Did IâHe was a lovely youth; most richly Deck'd with all lighter graces, music, painting, And poesy; and, as he grew to manhood, His talent grew finer and stronger. Proud Was his dear mother of his pretty songs, When Ellen Talbot sang them. Mordaunt. I have heard her. A queen might have been proud had such lips sung The lays of her king-son. Talbot. Poor Lionel Was with us long and often. In our house And in our hearts he held a brother's place, Till he at length forgot the unequal rank Which we would not remember. Rash and vain, And most presumptuous in his love!âAlas! And dare I blame him?âI!âMy sister saw His passion for Louisa, and she strove To check his hopes; but I saw nought, till all FatallyâfatallyâIt was a day Of sultry August, Lionel and I At sunset sought the river, and embarked Alone upon the waters. Oh how calm, How beautiful they were! How made for peace! The golden clouds shone into them, and there The soft and bright blue sky, fringed in by trees. My soul was lapp'd in the calm loveliness, The balmy silence. When, all suddenly, Lionel, heated as I think by wine, Demanded my Louisa's hand. Louisa! Mine own affianced bride! I told him this Calmly and soothingly; and he replied That I might force her hand, but that her heart Was his. Then the strong frenzy mastered me, And with the oar I dashed him overboard, Stunn'd, stupefied! I too stood motionless, Stunn'd, stupefied, till I saw the drowning wretch Rise on the waters. Then the sense returned; The fear, the hope, the breathless agony, The desperate struggle. How I toiled to save Whom I had murdered! How I rowed and swam, And dived, and all but died! We were drawn out Together; he a breathless corse, and I A wretch that could not die, doomed to live on, With the new, aching, gnawing consciousness Of deadly crime here at my heartâhere! here! Now, am I not a murderer? Mordaunt. Surely, no. It was a frenzied impulse; an unhappy, But unintended homicide. Thy will Was innocent of the deed. Talbot. Oft have I tried To think so; but I recollect too well I had a murderer's feelings when I raisedâ Seek not to palliate. Mordaunt. Yet be comforted. Whate'er the crime, surely the penalty May expiate; thy bitter sufferings, Thy deep and true repentance! Talbot. Oh, if tears Could wash out blood, no day hath passed but I Have thus embalmed his memory! Grievously Have I been punished; here, in my heart's core; In undeserved respect; in praise; in love; In poor Louisa; in my noble sister; In all the tears I cause. All lovely things Combine to punish me; the golden evening, The sunny waters, and the calm blue sky, They are my scourges! Oh the agony That I have felt at kindness! Most at hers, The mother's. After that most wretched night, My mind and body sank, alike subdued, For many weeks. A merciful pause it was Of misery! I woke again to suffer, And the first person by my couch was she In her deep mourning habit; her pale face Covered with tears, yet trying for a smile; And that voice, once so pleasant, low and hoarse, Yet striving still, in sweet and gentle words, To speak of love, and care, and gratitude To meâGreat God! to me!âfor all I dared To save her son! She thanked me, and she blessed me! She blessed me! Never curse struck to the soul Like that kind woman's blessing! Mordaunt. And she died? Talbot. She died. For Many weeks I watched her bed, And then I closed her eyes, and followed her, And saw her laid by him! That was my death-stroke. Then, when the earth fell cold on both my victims, My doom was sealed. Mordaunt. Oh say not so, dear Henry! Live for us all. For poor Louisa, live!â For thy own Eleanor!âfor me! Talbot. My heart Is lighter. When I die, if Eleanor Should grieve, as well I think she will, oh! tell her My story; she will then be comforted That I am in my grave. Poor, poor Louisa! When the oak falls, the ivy dies with it; And sheâBut I am better, lighter, easier In body and in soul. There is no balm So healing as a good man's pity. Mordaunt. Say His love, his deep respect. Thou hast well practised The painfullest and noblest of all virtuesâ Repentance. Comfort thee! Look forward, onward: Think in thy being how much happiness Is lapt. Talbot. Oh, my true friend! Hark! She comes here! I know her tread afar,âher nymph-like tread, So light and quick. The graceful greyhound scarce Can match her graceful speed. Enter Eleanor and Lousia. Louisa. Sir Francis, welcome! This is indeed a happiness.âHow well He looks! How much revived! Eleanor. His face is flushed; But thatâ Louisa. Look at his eye! and see! see! see! He smiles again! Oh blessings on his head Whose coming caused that smile! Mordaunt. Why such a blessing Might draw a man from Afric. Louisa. I could chide him That he did not come sooner, the dear friend, Bringer of health and comfort. Talbot. My Louisa, I do begin to hope. Louisa. Oh blessed sound! Talbot. When shall we forth into the woods, fair Ellen? Eleanor. First, dearest brother, rest awhile. The sun Is overcast. Wait till the clouds disperse. Rest thee. Ay, so. Now, shall I read to thee? Talbot. No. All this day, an old and favourite strain Hath echoed in mine ear. Wilt thou not sing it For me, Louisa? Louisa. Yes! oh yes! Eleanor. But listening To her sweet voice is not repose. Mordaunt. What then? Eleanor. Pleasure, exciting, searching, rapturous pleasure! Yet sing to him, Louisa! See how pale, How shiveringâHenry, thou art ill again? Talbot. No; 'twill pass off. Dearest and kindest sister, Believe, 'twill pass away. Now sing. Louisa. What song? Talbot. That which is ringing in mine ears. The strain, Which, by the old tradition of our house, Was wont to usher in the nuptial morn Of all the Talbotsâwhich I used to call Our bridal song, Louisa. I would fain Hear that song once again. Louisa. Not that! not that! Eleanor. Yes. 'Tis a pleasant and a ringing air, And suits thee well; thy springy form, thy voice, Young, lively, clear, thy blushing smile. Thou seem'st At once the quaint musician, the light nymph, Strewer of flowers, and the fair bride. Sing! Sing! Let's hear that pleasant strain.âStill paler!âSing! Louisa sings. Forth the lovely bride ye bring: Gayest flowers before her fling, From your high-piled baskets spread, Maidens of the fairy tread! Strew them far, and wide, and high A rosy shower 'twixt earth and sky! Strew about! Strew about For the burthen of this âStrew about! Strew about!â I am indebted to a song in Thomas Campion's âMemorable Masque.â! Bright jonquil, in golden pride, Fair carnation, freak'd and dyed, Strew about! Strew about! Dark-eyed pinks, with fringes light, Rich geraniums, clustering bright, Strew about! Strew about! Flaunting pea, and harebell blue, And damask-rose of deepest hue, And purest lilies, maidens, strew! Strew about! Strew about! Home the lovely bride ye bring: Choicest flowers before her fling, Till dizzying steams of rich perfume Fill the lofty banquet-room! Strew the tender citron there, The crushed magnolia proud and rare, Strew about! Strew about! Orange blossoms, newly dropp'd, Chains from high acacia cropp'd, Strew about! Strew about! Pale musk-rose, so light and fine, Cloves, and stars of jessamine, Strew about! Strew about! Tops of myrtle, wet with dew, Nipp'd where the leaflets sprout anew, Fragrant bay-leaves, maidens, strew! Strew about!â Eleanor. Oh help! he faints! Help! help! His breath is gone. Mordaunt. Alas! alas! he ne'erâI cannot find A pulseâalas! he's dead! Louisa. Dead! dare not say it! 'Tis but a swoon. He's better. He'll be well. Did he not say so,âhe whose voice was truth? And dost thou dareâOh rouse thee, my own Henry, And I will sing to theeâ Eleanor. Oh hush! hush! hush! Louisa. Will sing to thee the song thou lov'st so well. (Sings) Pale musk-rose so light and fine, Cloves, and stars of jessamineâ Eleanor. Cease! cease! Oh this is horrible! Weep! Weep! Weep for thy Henry! He is gone! the kindest, The tenderest, the best!âHer brain is wandering. Louisa (sings). Home the lovely bride ye bringâ I cannot sing. I have no breath. I tremble At my own voice. And heâhe listens not. Henry! He hears me not. He's dead! he's dead! Eleanor, he is dead! Eleanor. She, too, will die; That other dearest thing! And I alone, And desolateâ Mordaunt. No Ellen, not alone! Eleanor. Oh tell me, thou his friend, what load of griefâ Mordaunt. He died a penitent. Eleanor. For that, thank Heaven! All else may be endured. My kindest brother! My tenderest! my best! Farewell! Farewell!</field>
