      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 1. Scena. 1. Polina in a blewe Gowne, shadowed with a blacke Sarcenet, going to the Temple to praye, vpon Andrugios Tombe. Promise is debt, and I my vowe haue past, Andrugios Tombe, to wash with daylie teares: Which Sacrifice (although God wot in waste) I wyll performe, my Alter is of cares. Of fuming sighes, my offring incense is, My pittious playntes, in steede of Prayers are: Yea, woulde to God in penaunce of my mys. I with the rest, my loathed lyfe might share. But O in vaine, I wish this welcomde ende, Death is to slowe, to slaye the wretched wight: And all to soone, he doth his forces bende, To wounde their hartes, which wallowe in delight. Yet in my care, styll goes, my passing Bell, So ofte as I, Andrugios death doo minde: So ofte as men, with poynted fingers tell, Their friendes, my faultes, which by my weedes they finde. But O the cause, with Death, which threates me most, I wysh to dye, I dye through wretched woe, My dying harte, desires to yeelde the ghost, My traunces straunge, a present death foreshowe. But as the reede doth bow at euery blast. To breake the same, when rowghest stormes lackes might, So wretched I, with euery woe doe waste, Yet care wants force, to kyll my hart out ryght. O gratious God and is my gilt so great. As you the same, with thousand deathes must wreake? You will it so, else care I could intreate? With halfe these woes, my thryd of lyfe, to breake. But what meanst thou Polina, most accurst, To muse, why God, this pennaunce ioynes thee to? Whose correction, although we take at worst, To our great good he doth the same bestow. So that, syth greefe can not relyue my friend, Syth scorching syghes my sorrowes cannot drye: Syth care himselfe, lackes force my lyfe to ende, Syth styll I lyue that euery howre doe dye: Syth mighty God appoyntes my pennaunce so, In mornefull song I wyll my patience show, Polinas Song. Amyd my bale, the lightning ioy, that pyning care doth bring, VVith patience cheares my heauy hart, as in my vvoes I sing, I knovv my Gilt, I feele my scurge: my ease is death I see: And care (I fynde) by peecemeale vveares, my hart to set mee free. O care, my comfort and refuge, feare not to worke thy vvyll, VVith patience I, thy corsiues byde, feede on my life thy fyll. Thy appetyte with syghes and teares, I dayly vvyl procure, And wretched I, wil vaile to death, throw when thou wilt thy Lure. Exit, Polina, Scena. 2. Enter a Messenger from the King. I haue at length (though weery come in troth) Obtaynd a sight of Iulios stately walles, A Kings message, can not be done with sloth: Whome he bids goe, must runne through myre and dyrt, And I am sent, to Lord Promos in post, To tel him that the king wyll see him strayght, But much I feare that Promos needes not bost: Of any gayne by his soueraygnes receyte, But Holla tongue of lauysh speeche beware, Though subiects oft in Princes meaning prye, They must their words, and not their myndes declare, Unto which course I wyll my tongue apply, Lord Promos shall my princes comming know, My prince himselfe, the cause thereof shall show. Exit. Scena. 3. Rosko Lamias man. Ros. Ist possible that my Mistris Lamia, Ouer the shooes should b'yn loue with Phallax? Why by Iesus (as she her selfe doth saye,) With pure good wyll, her harte doth melt lyke waxe: And this I am sure, euery howre they themselues, By their sweete selues, or by their letters greete. But the sporte is to see the louing elues, Byll together when they in secret meete. She lowres, he lauffes, she syghes throwe pure loue. The strumpets and Crocodiles teares alyke. Nay, nay, sayes he (good pugges) no more of this: Well, sayes shee, and weepes, my griefe you do not proue. Then strayght this storme is cheared with a kys, And then aboth sides, three wordes and a smouch: Within hir eare, then whispereth this flouch, And by the way he stumbleth on her lyppes. Thus eyther stryues most louing signes to show, Much good doo it them, syth they are both content, Once I am sure, how so the game doth goe, I haue no cause their lyking to repent: I syldome doe betweene them message beare, But that I haue an Item in the hande, Well, I must trudge to doe a certaine chare, Which, take I tyme, cocke for my gayne doth stand. Scena. 4. Phallax. Dowson a Carpenter. Phal. Dispatch Dowson, vp with the frame quickly, So space your roomes, as the nyne worthyes may, Be so instauld, as best may please the eye. Dow. Uery good, I shall: Phal. Nay soft Dowson, stay: Let your man at saynt Annes crosse, out of hande, Ereckt a stage, that the Wayghts in sight may stande. Dow. Wyll you ought else? Phal. Soft awhyle, let mee see, On Iesus gate, the fowre vertues I trow, Appoynted are to stand: Dow. I syr, they are so. Phal. Wel, then about your charge, I wyll fore see, The Consort of Musick, well plast to be. Dow. I am gone syr. Exit. Scena. 5. The Bedell of the Taylers, Phallax. Be. Heare you maister Phallax? The Wardens of the Marchantaylers axe, Where (with themselues) they shall their Pageaunt place? Phal. With what strange showes, doo they their Pageaunt grace? Be. They haue Hercules, of Monsters conqueryng, Huge great Giants, in a forest fighting, With Lyons, Beares, VVolues, Apes, Foxes, and Grayes, Baiards, Brockes. &amp;c. Phal. O wondrous frayes, Marry syr, since they are prouided thus, Out of their wayes, God keepe Maister Pediculus. Be. You are plesaunt syr, but with speede I pray, You aunswere mee, I was charged not to stay. Phal. Because I know, you haue all things currant, They shall stand where they shal no viewers want: How say you to the ende of Ducke Alley? Be. There all the beggers in the towne wilbe. Phal. O, most attendaunce is, where beggers are, Farewell, away. Be. I wyll your wyll declare. Exit. Scena. 6. Phallax, Two men, apparrelled, lyke greene men at the Mayors feast, with clubbes of fyre worke. Phal. This geare fadgeth now, that these fellowes peare, Friendes where waight you? First. In Iesus streete to keepe a passadge cleare, That the King and his trayne, may passe with ease. Phal. O, very good, Second. Ought else Syr, do you please? Phal. No, no: about your charge. Both. We are gone: Exeunt. Phal. A syr, heare is short knowledge, to entertayne a kyng, But O, O, quid non pecunia? yea, at a dayes warning? The king in prouision that thought to take vs tardy, As if we had a yeare bene warnd, shall by his welcome see: I haue yet one chare to do: but soft, heare is Rosko, I must needes delyuer him a messadge before I goe. Scena. 7. Rosko, Phallax. Ros. I fayth, I haue noble newes for Lamia, Phal. Nay soft, friend Rosko, take myne in your way. Ros. Mayster Phallax, O syr I cry you mercy, Phal. Rosko with speede tell thy Mistris from mee, The King straight wayes wyll come to the Cytie: In whose great trayne there is a company, Within her house with mee shall mery be. Therefore, for my sake, wyll her to foresee, To welcome them, that nothing wanting be, This is all I wyll, for want of leysure. Exit. Ros. I wyll not fayle syr, to show your pleasure: Mary, in fayth, these newes falles iumpe with the rest, They shalbe welcome and fare of the best: But although they well fyll their bodyes thus, Their purses will be dryuen to a non plus: No force a whyt, each pleasure hath his payne, Better the purce then body starue of twayne. Well, I wyll trudge, my welcome newes to tell, And then abroade, good company to smell. Exit. Scena. 8. Coruinus the King, Cassandra, two counsellers. And Vdislao, a young noble man. Kyng. Cassandra, we draw neare vnto the Towne, So that I wyll that you from vs depart: Tyll further of our pleasure you doe heare. Yet rest assur'd, that wycked Promos, Shall abide such punishment, as the world, Shal hould mee iust, and cleare thee of offence. Cas. Dread soueraigne, as you wyl, Cassandra goeth hence. Exit. King. I playnely see, it tendes to great behoue, That Prynces oft doo vayle their eares to heare, The Misers playnt: for though they doe appoynt, Such as they thynke will Iustice execute, Aucthority is such a commaunder, As, where as men by office beareth sway, If they their rule by conscience measure not, The poore mans ryght is ouercome by might. If loue or hate from Iustice leade the Iudge, Then money sure may ouerrule the case. Thus one abuse is cause of many moe: And therefore none in Iudges ought to be, How Rulers wrong, fewe tales are tould the King: The reason is, their power keepes in awe Such men as haue great cause for to complayne. If Cassandra her goodes, nay, lyfe preferd, Before reuenge of Promos trechery: I had not knowne, his detestable rape, The which he forst to saue her brothers lyfe. And furthermore, Andrugios raunsome payde, I had not knowne he put him vnto death: For when (good soule) she had this treason tould, Through very shame her honour so was spoyld: She drewe her knyfe to wound her selfe to death. Whose pytious plyght, my hart prouockt to wrath, At Promos wyles: So that to vse indifferency to both, Euen in the place where all these wronges were done: My selfe am come, to syt vpon the cause. But see where Promos and the Mayor waight, To welcome mee with great solemnity: With cheereful showe I shadowe wyll the hate, I beare to him for his insolency: Perhaps I may learne more of his abuse, Whereby the more his punishment may be. Come my Lords, to the Towne haste we apace: All speake. We all are prest, to wayght vpon your Grace; Scena. 9. Promos, Maior, three Aldermen, in red Gownes, vvith a Sworde bearer, awayghtes the Kinges comming. Promos, his briefe Oration. Pro. Renowned King, lo here your faithful subiects preast to show The loyall duetie, which (in ryght) they to your highnesse owe. Your presence, cheares all sorts of vs: yet ten times more we ioye, You thinke vs stoarde, our warning short, for to receyue a Roye. Our wyll, is such, as shall supplie, I trust in vs all want, And where good wyll the welcome geues, prouision syld is scant. Loe, this is all: yea, for vs all, that I in wordes bestowe, Your Maiestie, our further zeale, in ready deedes shall knowe. And first, dreade King, I render you, the swoorde of Iustice heare, Which as your Liuetenant I trust, vprightlie I dyd beare. The King delyuers the Sworde, to one of his Counsell. King. Promos, the good report, of your good gouernment I heare, Or at the least, the good conceyte, that towards you I beare: To incourage you the more, in Iustice to perseauer, Is the cheefe cause, I dyd addresse, my Progresse heather. Pro. I thanke your Highnesse. The Maior presentes the King, with a fayre Purse. Ma. Renowned King, our ready wylles to showe, In your behalfe, our goodes (nay lyues) to spende: In all our names, I freelie here bestowe On your Highnes, this Purse: vnto this ende, To possesse your most Royall Maiestie, In all our wealth, therto bounde by duetie. Kin. Your great good wyls, and gyfts with thanks I take: But keepe you styll, your goodes, to do you good. It is inough, and all that I do craue, If needes compels for your and our safety, That you in part your proffers large performe: And for this time as outward showes make proofe, It is inough (and all that I desire) That your harts and tongues (alyke) byd me welcome. All. Lord preserue your Maiesty. Fiue or sixe, the one halfe men, the other vvomen, neare vnto the Musick, singing on some stage, erected from the ground: During the first parte of the song, the King faineth to talke sadlie vvith some of his Counsell. The Kings Gentleman Vsher. Forewards my Lordes. They all go out leysurablie vvhile the rest of the Song is made an ende.</field>

Se. Nay mary, the same I would gladly pay, But my bonde for the forfeyt he doth stay. Vl. Summum Ius, I see, is Summa Iniuria: So these wronges must be salued some other way. First. Yea, more then this, most men say: Vl. What? First. To be playne, he keepes Mistris Lamia. Vl. Admyt he doe, what helpe haue you by this? Se. Yes mary, it prooues, a double knaue he is: A couetous churle, and a lecher too. Vl.

These cunning Theeues, with lawe, can Lordships steale, When for a sheepe, the ignoraunt are trust: Yea, who more rough, with small offenders deale, Then these false men, to make themselues seeme iust? The tirant Phallaris, was praysed in this, When Perillus the brasen torment made: He founde the wretch, strayght wayes in some amys, And made him first, the scourge thereof taste: A iust reward for such as doe present An others fault, himselfe, the guiltyest man. Well, to our weale, our gratious king is bent, To taste these theeues, to vse what meanes he can. But as at Cheastes, though skylfull players play, Skyllesse vewers, may see, what they omyt: So though our king, in searching Iudgement may, Gesse at their faultes, which secret wronges commit: Yet for to iudge, by trueth, and not by ame, My selfe in cheefe, his highnesse doth auctorise, On proofe for to returne who meryts blame, And as I fynde, so he himselfe will punish: So that to vse, my charge indyfferently, My Clyents wronges, I wyll with wytnesse trye.

Enter the King, Promos, Vlrico, Maior, Gonsago, Phallax, with two other attendantes. King. Sir Gonsago, if that we henceforth heare, With will, or wealth, you doe our subiects wrong: Looke not agayne, this fauour for to fynde, We vse this grace, to wyn you to amende: If not, our wrath shall feare you to offende. God speede you. Gonsago, doth reuerence and departeth. Kyng. I see by proofe, that true the prouerbe is, Myght maisters right, wealth is such a canker, As woundes the conscience, of his Maister, And deuoures the hart of his poore neyghbour. To cure which sore, Iustice his pryde must pyne, Which Iustice ought in Princes most to shine: And syth subiects lyue by their princes law, Whose lawes in cheefe, the rytch should keepe in awe: The poore in wronges, but sildome doth delyght, They haue inuffe, for to defende their right: It much behoues the maker of these lawes, (This mony findes in them, so many flawes) To see his lawes, obser'd as they are ment: Or else good lawes, wyll turne to euyll intent. Well, ere I leaue, my poorest subiects shall, Both lyue, and lyke: and by the richest stawll. Pro. Regarded and most mightie Prince, your clemency herein, Those harts, your rule, c?mands through feare to faithful loue shal win. Vl. Renowmed king, I am for to complaine, Of Phallax, Lord Promos secondary, Whose hainous wronges many poore men doth paine, By me, who pray, your highnes remedy. King. My Lord Promos, it seemes you rule at large, When as your clarkes are officers vniust. Pro. Dread king, I thinke, he can these wrong discharge. Kyng. Doe you but thinke syr: a sure speare to trust? A dum death, and blynde Iudge, can do as much: Well, well, God graunt, your owne lyfe, byde the tutch. Syr Vlrico, your complaynt continew: Vl. Gratious King, his wronges be these insew: Fyrst Phallax, is a common Barriter, In office, a lewd extortioner: The crafty man, oft puts these wronges in vre, If poore men haue, that lykes his searching eye, He showeth gould, the needy soules to lure: Which if they take, so fast he doth them tye, That by some bonde, or couenaunt forfayted, They are inforst (farre beneath the vallew) To let him haue what his eye coueyted: And for to proue, that this report is true, I showe no more, then witnesse prou'd by oth, Whose names and handes, defends it heare as troth, Vlrico deliuers the King a writing with names at it. King. How now Promos? how thinke you of your man? Use both your wyttes, to cleare him if you can. Pro. Dread King, my hart to heare his faultes doth bleede. King. Howe far'de it then, to suffer it indeede? It dyde, I trowe, or now you speake in iest: Thy Master's mute Phallax, I hould it best That thou speake, for thy selfe. Phal. I humbly craue, Of your grace, for aunswere, respyt to haue. King. Why? to deuise a cloke to hyde a knaue? Friend, veritas non querit angulos, And if your selfe, you on your truth repose, You may be bould, these faultes for to deny, Some, lyttel care, vpon their othes to lye: See if any in your behalfe will sweare. Phal. O Lord God, is there no knyghtes of the poste heare? Well, then of force, I must sing Peccaui. And crye out ryght, to the king for mercy. O King, I am, in faulte, I must confesse, The which I wyll with repentaunce redresse. King. Thy confession, doth meryt some fauour, But repentaunce payes not thy poore neyghbour: Wherefore, Syr Vlrico, his goods sease you, And those, he wrong'd, restore you, to their due. Vl. Looke what he gettes, most thinke, he wastes straight waye, Upon a leawde harlot, named Lamia: So that his goods, wyll scarse pay euery wight. King. Where naught is left, the king must lose his right. Pay as you may, I hould it no offence, If eache pay somewhat for experience: But by the way, you rule the citty well, That suffer, by your nose, such dames to dwell. And now Phallax, thy further pennaunce ys, That forthwith, thou do resigne thy office. Vlrico, to his account lykewise, see. Vl. It shalbe done. King. Phallax, further heare mee: Because thou didst, thy faultes at first confesse, From punishment, thy person I release: Phal. I most humbly, do thanke your maiesty. Pro. Ah, out alas, Cassandra heare I see. Cassandra in a blewe gowne, shadowed with black. Cas. O would yt teares, myght tel my tale, I shame so much my fall, Or else, Lord Promos lewdnes showen, would death would ende my thrall. Pro. Welcome my sweete Cassandra. Cas. Murdrous varlet, away. Renowmed King, I pardon craue, for this my bould attempt, In preasing thus so neare your grace, my sorrow to present: And least my foe, false Promos heare, doe interrupt my tale, Graunt gratious King, that vncontrould, I may report my bale. King. How now Promos? how lyke you, of this song? Say on fayre dame, I long to heare thy wrong. Cas. Then knowe dread souerayne, that he this doome did geue, That my Brother, for wantonnesse should lose his head: And that the mayde, which sind, should euer after lyue In some religious house, to sorrowe her misdeede: To saue my brother iug'd to dye, with teares I sought to moue Lord Promos hart, to showe him grace: but he with lawles loue, Was fyred by and by: and knowing necessity, To saue my brothers lyfe, would make me yeeld to much, He crau'd this raunsome, to haue my virginitie: No teares could worke restraynt, his wicked lust was such, Two euils here were, one must I chuse, though bad were very best. To see my brother put to death, or graunt his lewde request: In fyne, subdude with naturall loue, I did agree, Upon these two poyntes: that marry mee he should, And that from prison vyle, he should my brother free. All this with monstrous othes, he promised he would. But O this periurd Promos, when he had wrought his wyll, Fyrst cast mee of: and after causd the Gailer for to kill My brother, raunsomde, with the spoyle of my good name: So that for companing, with such a hellish feende, I haue condemnde my selfe to weare these weedes of shame: Whose cognisance doth showe, that I haue (fleshly) sind. Loe thus, hie and renowned king, Cassandra endes her tale, And this is wicked Promos that hath wrought her endles bale. King. If this be true, so fowle a deede, shall not vnpunisht goe, How sayst thou Promos, to her playnte? arte giltye? yea, or noe? Why speakst thou not? a faulty harte, thy scilence sure doth showe. Pro. My gilty hart commaunds my tongue, O king, to tell a troth, I doe confesse this tale is true, and I deserue thy wrath. King. And is it so? this wicked deede, thou shalt ere long buy deare, Cassandra, take comfort in care, be of good cheere: Thy forced fault, was free from euill intent, So long, no shame, can blot thee any way. And though at ful, I hardly can content thee, Yet as I may, assure thy selfe I wyl. Thou wycked man, might it not thee suffice, By worse then force, to spoyle her chastitie, But heaping sinne on sinne against thy oth, Haste cruelly, her brother done to death. This ouer proofe, ne can but make me thinke, That many waies thou hast my subiectes wrongd: For how canst thou with Iustice vse thy swaie? When thou thy selfe dost make thy will a lawe? Thy tyrranny made mee, this progresse make, How so, for sport tyll nowe I colloured it Unto this ende, that I might learne at large, What other wronges by power, thou hast wrought, And heere, I heare: the Ritche suppresse the poore: So that it seemes, the best and thou art friendes: I plaste thee not, to be a partiall Iudge. Thy Offycers are couetous I finde, By whose reportes, thou ouer rulest sutes: Then who that geues, an Item in the hande, In ryght, and wrong, is sure of good successe. Well, Uarlet, well: too slowe I hether came, To scourge, thy faultes, and salue the sores thou mad'st: On thee vyle wretche, this sentence I pronounce. That foorthwith, thou shalt marrie Cassandra, For to repayre hir honour, thou dydst waste: The next daye thou shalt lose thy hated lyfe, In penaunce, that thou mad'st hir Brother dye. Pro. My faultes were great, O King, yet graunt me mercie, That nowe with bloody sighes, lament my sinnes too late. King. Hoc facias alteri, quod tibi vis fieri: Pittie was no plee Syr, when you in iudgement sate, Prepare your selfe to dye, in vaine you hope for lyfe. My Lordes, bring him with mee: Cassandra come you in like case: My selfe wyll see, thy honour salu'd, in making thee his Wife, The sooner to shorten his dayes. All the company. We wayte vpon your Grace. As the King is going out, a Poore man shall kneele in his waye. Kyng. Syr Vlrico, I wyld, Commission should be made, To Syr Anthony Alberto, and Iustice Diron, To heare and determine, all sutes to be had Betwene Maister Prostro, and this poore man: is it done? Vlrico. Renowned King, it is ready: King. Repayre to Syr Ulrico, for thy Commission: All. God preserue your Maiestie. They all depart, saue the Clowne. Clow. Bones of me, a m? were better speak to great Lords chy see, Then to our proude, Iustlers of peace, that byn in the cuntry: He that is rytch, as my dame sayth, goes away with the Hare. This two yeere, they haue hard my matter, &amp; yet cham nere ye neere. And at first dash, a good fatte Lorde, God in heauen saue his life, Fayth, for nothing, teld the King of Mas Prostros, and my strife. O Leard, ych thought the King could not bide, on poore men to looke, But God saue his Grace, at fyrst dash, my Supplycation he tooke: And you hard, how gently, he calld mee poore man, and wild me goe, For my Pasport, I kenne not what, to good syr Vlrico. Well, chull goe fort, and hope to be with Master Prostros to bring: But ere ych goe, chul my Ballat, of good King Coruine sing. The Clownes Song. You Barrons bolde, and lustie Lads, Prepare to welcome, our good King: VVhose comming so, his Subiectes glads, As they for ioye, the Belles doo ryng. They fryske, and skippe, in euerie place, And happy he, can see his face. VVho checks the rytch, that wrong by might, And helpes the poore, vnto his right. The loue that rygour gettes through feare, VVith grace and mercie, he doth wyn: For which we praye thus, euerie where, Good Lorde preserue, our King Coruin. His fauour raignes, in euerie place: And happy he, can see his face. Exit.</field>

If che could finde my Mare, che would be rusty by the rood, And cham sure the hoorechup, is peaking in this wood. Chy wyl seeke euery corner, but che wyll find her. He whistlyng lookes vp and downe the stage. An. This clowne can hardly mee bewray, and yet such dunghyll churles, Such newes, as is in market tounes, about the country whorles. What seekes thou good fellow? Iohn. My sqawde Mare, dost her know? An. No. Iohn. Then scummer mee not, in haste ych goe, Seeke my Mare, to see the sport at Iulio. An. What sport? Iohn. A lyttel sport. An. What? Iohn. Nay skyl not a whit? An. What meanes this Asse? Iohn. T'wyll teache the hoorecup wyt. H'yll hang, handsome young men for the soote sinne of loue, When so his knauery, himselfe, a bawdy iack doth proue. An. His wordes seemeth straunge, somwhat is a wry. Iohn. UUel, chyll see his shoulders, from's iowle to flye. An. UUhose shoulders friend? Iohn. As though you dyd know. An. UUhome? Iohn. Lord Promos. An. Yes: my most accursed foe: But what of him? Iohn. Thou kenst. An. No. Iohn. Sayst not, yes, An. Yes: Iohn. So. An. But friend thou took'st my wordes amys, I know nothing, in what state Promos is. Iohn. Thou knowst, and thou knowest not: out horson foole, Leaue stealing Cunnyes, and get thee to scoole, Farewell. An. Soft. Iohn. O th'arte no foole good theefe: Saue my mony take my life. An. Tush be breefe. Some newes, of lewde Lord Promos tell mee, And wyth lyfe and mony, yle set thee free. Iohn. I wyll: thou knowst the King now at Iulio. An. Uery well, Iohn. Thou canst tel as wel as I. Let me goe: An. Nay yle see if thou dost lye. If thou dost, yle whip thee, when thou hast done. Iohn. Kissyng and lying, ich see is all one: And chaue no mony, chul tell true therfore. An. Dispatch then. Iohn. Then, lying Promoter, this more: Casgandra scusde, Promos of honestie: And killyng Ramstrugio for baudry. An. What more? Iohn. The king at Promos, great pleasure did take, And Casgandra, an honest woman to make: The King maunded him, her strayght to marry, And for killyng her brother, he must dye. An. Is this true? Iohn. Why? how say you? doe I lye? An. Well, so or noe, for thy newes haue this connie. Iohn. Gods boores, geue it me, to be swete, tis to cheape, Bur Lady yet, tyll sunday it will keepe: Well, now god bwye, Mas lying Promoter, Wees see at the sport. An. I peraduenture. Iohn. Since can not finde my Mare, on foote chull goe: Ych thinke, each daye a nowre, to be at Iulio. Exit. An. Straunge are the newes, the Clowne hath showne to me: Not straunge a whyt, if they well scanned be. For God we see, styll throwes the Tyrant downe: Euen in the heyght, and pride of his renowne. Lorde Promos rule, nay, tyranny in deede, For Iudges is a mirror, worthy heede. The wretched man, with showe of Iustice zeale, Throughly dyd, with poore offenders deale. The wicked man, both, knewe, and iudg'd, abuse: And none so much, as he her faultes dyd vse. He fellons hang'd, yet by extorcion, stoale: He wantons plag'd, himselfe a doating foole. He others checkt, for suing for their right: And he himselfe, mayntained wrongs by might. But see the rule of mischiefe, in his pride: He headlong falles, when least, he thought to slide. Well, by his fall, I maye perhaps aryse: Andrugio yet, in clyming be thou wyse. What? styll vnknowne, shall I liue in this wood? Not so. Go wraye these newes, no doubt, vnto my good. Yet ere I go, I wyll my selfe disguise, As in the Towne, in spyte of Linxes eyes. I wyll vnknowne, learne howe the game doth go, But ere I go, syth eased is my woe: My thankes to God, I first in song wyll shoe. Andrugios Song. To thee O Lorde, with harte, and voyce I syng, VVhose mercie great, from mone to sweete delight: From griefe to ioye, my troubled soule doest bring, Yea, more thy wrath, hath foylde my foe in syght. VVho sought my lyfe (which thou O God didst saue) Thy scorge hath brought, vntimelie to his graue. VVhose griefe wyll gawle, a thousande Iudges moe, And wyll them see, them selues, and sentence iust: When blacke reproche, this thundring shame shall shoe, A Iudge condemde for murder, thefte, and luste. This scorge, O God, the lewde in feare wyll bring, The iust for ioye, thy prayses lowde wyll syng. Exit. Gresco, with three other, with bylles, bringing in Lamia prisoner. Gres. Come on faire Dame, since faire words, works no heede, Now fowle meanes shall: in you repentaunce breede. La. Maister Gresco, where you maye helpe, hurt not. Gres. And nothing but chastment, wyll helpe you to amende, Well, I wyll not hurt you, your lewdnes to defende. La. My lewdnes Syr: what is the difference, Betwixt wantons, and hoorders of pence? Gres. Thou hast winde at wyll, but in thy eyes no water: Tho' arte full of Grace, howe she blusheth at the matter. La. Howe sample I, your wyfe and daughter Syr? Gres. Axe mee, when whypping hath chaung'd thy Nature. La. What whypping? why? am I a Horse, or a Mare? Gres. No, but a beast, that meetelie well wyll bare. La. In deede (as) nowe, perforce, I beare this flowt: But vse me well, else I fayth, gette I out, Looke for quittaunce. Byl. Binde hir to the Peace Syr, First Bilm So maye your Worship be out of daunger. Gres. Bring hir awaye, I knowe howe to tame hir. La. Perhaps Syr, no: the worst is but shame hir. Byl. Come ye drab. Sec?d Bilm La. Howe nowe scab? handes of my Gowne. Byl. Care not for this, yuse haue a blew one soone. Third Bil. Exeunt. Cassandra. Cas. Unhappy Wench, the more I seeke, for to abandone griefe, The furder off, I wretched finde, both comfort and reliefe. My Brother first, for wanton faultes, condempned was to dye: To saue whose life, my sute, wrought hope of Grace, but haples I, By such request, my honor spoyld, and gayned not his breath: For which deceyte, I haue pursude, Lorde Promos vnto death. Who is my Husbande nowe become, it pleasd our Soueraigne so, For to repayre, my crased Fame: but that nowe workes my wo. This day, he must (oh) leese his head, my Brothers death to quite, And therin Fortune hath alas, showne me hir greatest spyte. Nature wyld mee, my Brother loue, now dutie commaunds mee, To preferre before kyn, or friend, my Husbands safetie. But O, aye mee, by Fortune, I, am made his chiefest foe: T'was I als, euen onely I, that wrought his ouerthroe. What shall I doo, to worke amends, for this my haynous deede? The tyme is short, my power small, his succors axeth speede. And shall I seeke, to saue his blood, that lately sought his lyfe? O, yea I then was sworne his foe: but nowe as faithfull Wife, I must and wyll, preferre his health, God sende me good successe: For nowe vnto the King I wyll, my chaunged minde to expresse. Exit. Phallax. Phal. Was euer man, set more freer then I? First went my goodes, then my Office dyd flye? But had the King, set me free from flattrie, The next deare yeare, I might haue staru'd, perdie. But Lorde Promos, hath a farre more freer chaunce: He free from Landes, goodes, and Office doth daunce: And shalbe free from life, ere long, with a Launce. The Officers, and chiefe men of Iulio: Uengeaunce lyberall, themselues lyke wise shoe. Poore knaues, and queanes, that vp and downe do goe, These horesen kinde crustes, in houses bestoe. But yet, poore cheere, they haue: marry for heate, They whyp them, vntyll verie blood they sweate. But see, their cost bestowde of fyne Lamia, To saue hir feete, from harde stones, and culde waye, Into a Carte, they dyd the queane conuaye. Apparelled, in collours verie gaye: Both Hoode, and Gowne, of greene, and yellowe Saye. Hir Garde, weare Typstaues, all in blewe arraye. Before hir a noyse of Basons dyd playe, In this triumphe, she ryd well nye a daye. Fie, fie. the Citie is so purged nowe: As they of none, but honest men allowe, So that farewell my parte, of thriuing there: But the best is, flattrers lyue euerie where. Set cocke on hoope, Domini est terra. If thou can not where thou wouldst, lyue where thou maye, Yes, yes Phallax, knoweth whether to go: Nowe, God bwy ye all honest men of Iulio As the Deuilles lykes, the company of Friers, So flattrers loues as lyfe, to ioyne with lyers.</field>

These two dayes, I haue bene in Court disguis'd: Where I haue learnd, the scorge that is deuis'd, For Promos faulte, he my Syster spowsed hath, To salue hir Fame, crackt by his breache of fayth. And shortlie he, must lose his subtyll head: For murdring me, whome no man thinkes but dead. His wyll, was good: and therfore beshrewe mee, If (mou'd with ruthe) I seeke, to set him free. But softlie, with some newes, these fellowes come: I wyll stande close, and heare both all and some. Scena. 2. Enter Vlrico, Marshall. Vl. Marshall, heare you warrant is: with speede, The king commaundes, that Promos you behead. Mar. Sir, his highnesse wyll, shalbe forthwith done. Exit. Marshall. Vl. The king welnye to pardon him was wonne, His heauy wyfe, such stormes of teares did showre, As myght, with rueth, haue moyst a stony hart. But Promos guylt, dyd soone this grace deuoure. Our gratious king, before hir wretched smart, Preferd, the helth, of this our common weale: But see againe, to sue for him she comes, Her ruthfull lookes, her greefe, doth force mee feele. With hope, I must, hir sorrowes needes delay: Tyll Promos be dispacht out of the way. Scena. 3. Cassandra. Cas. Syr Vlrico, if that my vnknowne greefe, May moue good mindes, to helpe mee to releefe, Or bytter syghes, of comfort cleane dismayde, May moue a man, a shiftlesse dame to ayde: Rue of my teares, from true intent which flowe, Unto the king, with me, yet once more goe. See if his grace, my husbands lyfe wyll saue, If not, with his, death shall my corps ingraue. Vl. What shall I doe, her sorrowes to decreace? Feede her, with hope: fayre dame, this mone surcease, I see the king to grace is somewhat bent, We once agayne thy sorrowes wyll present: Come we wyl wayght for tyme, thy sute to show. Cas. Good knight, for time, doe not my sute foreslowe. Whylst grasse, doth growe ofte sterues the seely steede. Vl. Feare not, your Lorde, shal not dye with such speede. Exeunt. Enter Andrugio. An. Lord God, how am I tormented in thought? My sisters woe, such rueth in me doth graue: As fayne I would (if ought saue death I caught) Bewray my selfe, Lord Promos life to saue. But lyfe is sweete, and naught but death I eye, If that I should, my safety now disclose: So that I chuse, of both the euels, he dye: Time wyll appease, no dought, Cassandras woes, And shal, I thus acquite Cassandras loue? To worke her ioy? and shall I feare to dye? Whylst, that she lyue, no comforte may remoue Care from her harte, if that hir husband dye? Then shall I stycke, to hasard lym? nay life? To salue hir greefe, since in my cure it rests. Nay fyrst, I wilbe spoyld, with blooddy knife, Before, I fayle, her, plunged in distres. Death, is but death, and all in fyne shall dye Thus (being dead) my fame, shall liue alway: Well, to the king, Andrugio now wyll hye, Hap lyfe, hap death, his safety, to bewray. Exit. Scena. 4.

Farewell, my friendes, take warning by my fall, Disdaine my life, but lysten to my ende, Fresh harmes, they say, the viewers so apall, As oft they win, the wicked to amend. I neede not heare, my faultes at large resyte, Untimely death, doth witnesse what I was: A wicked man, which made eache wrong seeme right, Euen as I would, was wrested euery case. And thus long tyme, I liu'd and rule by wyl, Where as I lou'd, their faultes, I would not see: Those I did hate, tenne tymes beyond there yll I did persue, vyle wretch, with cruelty. Yea dayly I, from bad, to worse did slyde, The reason was, none durst, controule my lyfe: But see the fall, of mischeeue, in his pride, My faultes, were knowne, and loe with bloddy Axe, The headseman strayght, my wronges with death wyll quite: The which, in worth I take, acknowledging, The doome, was geuen, on cause, and not on spyte, Wishing my ende, might serue for a warning. For such as rule, and make their will a lawe, If to such good, my faynting tale might tend, Wretched Promos, the same would lenger draw: But if that wordes preuayle, my wofull ende From my huge faultes, then tenne times more wyll warne. Forgeuenesse now, of all the world I craue, Therewith that you, in zealous prayer, wyll Beseeche of God, that I the grace may haue: At latter gaspe, the feare of death to kyll. Mar.

The rest are these. When I should dye, the Gayler mou'd to ruth, Declard to mee, what Promos pleasure was: Amazde wherat, I tolde him all the trueth, What, betwene Cassandra, and him dyd passe. He much agrieu'd, Lorde Promos guylt to heare, Was verie lothe, mee (wofull man) to harme: At length, iust God, to set me (wretched) cleare, With this defence, his wylling minds dyd arme. Two dayes afore, to death, were diuers done, For seuerall faultes, by them committed: So that of them, he tooke the head from one, And to Cassandra, the same presented: Affirming it, to be hir brothers head. Which done, by night, he sent me post away, None but supposed, that I in deede was dead: When as in trueth, in vncouth hauntes I laye. In fine, a Clowne, came peaking through the wood, Wherin I lyu'd, your Graces being here: And Promos death, by whome I vnderstood, Glad of which newes, howe so I lyud in feare.

Which I conceyued agaynst my brother Promos, That loe, I chews'd, to yeeld my selfe to death, To set him free: for otherwyse I knew, His death ere long, would sure haue stopt her breath. Loe gratious king, in breefe I here haue showne, Such aduentures, as wretched I haue past: Beseeching you with grace to thinke vpon, The wight that wayles, his follyes at the last. King. A strange discourse, as straungely come to light, Gods pleasure is, that thou should'st pardoned be: To salue the fault, thou with Polina mad'st, But marry her, and heare I set thee free. An. Most gratious Prince, thereto I gladly gree: Poli. Polina, the happiest newes of all for thee. Cas. Most gratious King, with these my ioye to match, Uouchsafe, to geue my dampned husbande lyfe. King. If I doo so, let him thanke thee his Wife: Cassandra, I haue noted thy distresse, Thy vertues eke, from first, vnto the last: And glad I am, without offence it lyes, In me to ease, thy griefe, and heauines.

Well, since all partes are pleased, as they woulde, Before I parte, yet Promos, this to thee: Henceforth, forethinke, of thy forepassed faultes, And measure Grace, with Iustice euermore. Unto the poore, haue euermore an eye, And let not might, out countenaunce their right: Thy Officers, trust not in euery tale. In chiefe, when they are meanes, in strifes and sutes, Though thou be iust, yet coyne maye them corrupt. And if by them, thou dost vniustice showe, Tys thou shalt beare, the burden of their faultes. Be louing to good Cassandra, thy Wife: And friendlie to thy brother Andrugio, Whome I commaund, as faythfull for to be To thee, as beseemes the duety of a brother. And now agayne, thy gouernment receyue, Inioye if so, as thou in Iustice ioye. If thou be wyse, thy fall maye make thee ryse. The lost sheepe founde, for ioye, the feast was made. Well, here an ende, of my aduise I make, As I haue sayde, be good vnto the poore, And Iustice ioyne, with mercie enermore. Pro. Most gratious King, I wyll not fayle my best, In these preceptes, to followe your beheast. FINIS. G. Whetstone.</field>
