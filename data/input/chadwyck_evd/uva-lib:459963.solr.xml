      <field name="fulltext">THE Epistle Dedicatory TO THE QUEEN's MOST Sacred Majesty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Scene the Piazza before or near the Palace. The Curtain rises and discovers Castrucio, Rimini, Lorenzo, Valori, Adimari, and Bernardo. Castr. [Aside to Valori pointing to Lorenzo and Rimini, talking to each other.] I like not yon Lorenzo, Cosmo's Son, So great, so intimate with Rimini— He is a Spie set on us by his Father! I hate the Name of Medici, the Peoples Idol, And Bane of All the Noble men of Florence. Valo. Fear not Lorenzo, he is firmly Ours, Bound to our Cause, as fast, as Love can bind him. Bianca, Rimini's fair Daughter makes him ours; Besides his Father Cosmo di Medici Still curbs his haughty, and his fiery Temper. Cast. Enough—And yet we shou'd be cautious— For Friends, Valori, that wild Passion gives us, Are Friends but while that lasts. Val. No more—see now they joyn us. Loren. No may my Sword ne'r do me Right, my Friend, But hated Cowardice still blast my Name, If ever I submit to this Mob Government, Tho' my own Father stoops to be its Head. The generous Spirits of the Medici Throng to my Heart, and bid me guard their Glory; Rescue the ancient Honours of their Race From the degenerate Meaness of my Father. Rim. O! My Lorenzo! I will be thy Father— Let but this dreadful Shock of State be past, And my Bianca shall return to Florence, And bless thy Arms, and make thee firm my Son. But while our Country groans beneath this Load, Th'enormous Load of popular Confusion. Can any noble Soul indulge a Joy? Or think of Pleasure midst our City's Pangs? Lor. O my dear Rimini! Tho' thy fair Daughter's Life to my fond Soul And every Beauty promise Worlds of Joy, Yet my great Mind, m'ambitious Mind now thirsts With so much Eagerness for what it aims at, Immortal Honour in my Country's Rescue, That ev'n my Love, with all its fierce Desires Are still as Death, nor burn its pleasing Fires! And Natures Voice tho' in a Father's Name Dies e're it reach my Soul thus fixt on endless Fame. Rim. Come to my Arms, O thou so truly brave, Thou may'st redeem the Errours of thy Race. Castrucio, and Valori, Adimari, haste, And thou Bernardo clasp him to your Bosom, And bless those Pow'rs, that yet look kindly on us, In giving Florence, in this Dearth of Virtue, A Son like him. Loren. No, no, my Rimini, Lorenzo is impatient of Delay. Yon Palace there, the ancient Seat of Justice; The awful Throne of the illustrious Nobles, Is now become the Receptacle of Knaves; The Den of the impure, and rascally Rout; Or those deputed by 'em, miscall'd Magistrates. As yet you hold a share in Pow'r, delay not To snatch poor Florence from this Infamy, Least she too soon be ravish'd from your Hands. You do not well Observe my cunning Father, How he still strives to wean the Rable from you, By preaching to 'em you're Rinaldo's Cousin; Grown up, and fixt still in the Nobles Faction. Where are the Honours paid your awful place? Why are not you Saluted like proud Cosmo? What are you but the Ape, the mimic God To this new Thunderer, who appropriates Those Bolts of Pow'r, that ought to be devided. Rim. 'Tis just he shou'd, and I deserve it all! That prompted by my Passion cou'd forget My Duty to Rinaldo, and my Country, And to a private Passion give up both. By me the Senate, and Podesta sorm'd Out of his Friends, soon call'd from hateful Exile The fatal Cosmo, and gave him once again To Lord it o're us.— Arm'd thus by me he drove Rinaldo hence, The Nobles Chief and Safeguard of our State. Me! therefore me! first strike—for I betray'd You and my self, with all the Rights of Florence. Cast. My Lord, to err is humane The Wisest often err, o're-born by Passion. It is enough you do not persevere; But seek, e're 'tis too late, to rescue us From your Mistake. Lor. But that requires much speed My Father Cosmo, seeks to make Uberto Captain of the People in your Place; For he, like him, can fawn upon the Multitude. Now, by my Soul, I hate their awker'd Pride, That scorns the Rule of Nobles, and yet stoops Most abjectly to court the brutish Vulgar! O Rimini! have you no Eyes to find them? Rim. What means Lorenzo? Lor. To rouse you. Consider Why Providence has rais'd you to this Pow'r And kept it still, by Wonder in your Hands. Not to set off his upstart Honours, Where you are plac'd but like a winking Taper In the Suns Eye, whose faint, and sickly Beams Are swallow'd in the Blaze of his full Glory. He, like a Meteor, rolls through the Abyss Conspicuous in his Orb of fatal Light, While your pale Lustre adds but to the Beard That awes degenerate Florence. Rim. Why dost thou place my Infamy before me? Lor. When Cosmo late in Tryumph past thro' Florence Fixt on his Courser, mark'd you how he bow'd? On this, on that side to the Gazing Heads, That pav'd the Streets, and all inboss'd the Windows, That gap'd with eagerness to speak, but cou'd not? So fast their Spirits flow'd to Admiration, And that to Joy; which thus at last broke forth— Cosmo! hail! Cosmo! Father of thy Country Hail Guardian! hail Deliverer of Florence! All hail! they cry'd, while the long Peal of Praises Tormented with a Thousand ecchoing Shouts The Ambient Air. Rim. No more on't, I'm sick of the Remembrance, Lor. But when you follow'd, how their bellying Bodies, That ventur'd from the Casements more, than half To look at Cosmo, nay that stuck like Snails Upon the Walls, and from the Houses Tops Hung down like clustring Bees upon each other, How did they all draw back at sight of you? To laze, and loll, and yawn, and rest from Rapture! Are you a Man? Inrich'd with the best Blood Of Florence? us'd too so long to Greatness, And suffer this? Rim. Be sure I will not.—But whither driv'st thou? Lor. I wou'd to Justice: to the Restoration Of all the banish'd Noble-men Yes Rimini I look upon my Father as a Traytor, No more my Father now, by all my hopes. And to redeem his Crime, I'll on as far, As him, that laughs at Dying. Rim. O Soul! and Spirit of the ancient Medici! Oh! once more to my Bosome let me clasp thee! Yes, yes thou shalt have Work, thy active Mind Shall soon have bright Employment. So rich a Virtue shall not rust in Idleness, Oh! that thy Brother had a Soul like thine? Lor. Oh! lucky be the Omen! for this Morning My Brother Julio Marry'd Teraminta. Rim. Banish'd Rinaldo's Daughter? Lor. The same. Rim. Impossible. Lor. Most true. Rim. That must enrage his Father, Who hates Rinaldo, and his noble House. Lor. And more, than once he has forbid his Love. Rim. This may indeed engage him in our Cause. His Father's Rival in the peoples Hearts. Enter Cosmo, Uberto Senators and Attendants. But see Cosmo appears— Stand we aside, and let the Pageant pass. Cos. speaks entering to Uberto. No my Uberto, till thou'rt fixt my Mate Joint Master in this great Authority, Florence can ne'r be safe, or quiet. While Rimini sits at the Helm A universal Wreck is to be fear'd. His false designs are not unknown to me. Uber. I have my self imploy'd an active Slave, His name is Lando, giv'n him Wealth, and Freedom To watch the motions of Castrucio Of Adimari, and young Valori, With all the Riotous, bosome Friends of Rimini, Castrucio has already Entertain'd him, And something thence Important may be gather'd, For these of all the Youth of Quality Are most enclin'd to the false Nobles Faction. Cosm. That care was worthy my Uberto, [looking about. —Ha—See, Uberto, see! How here in Public; And in the Face of day; the Eye of Florence, The abject Captain mingles with those Boys!— Now by my Countries Genius, that warms my Bosom, And fires my Heart with more, than common Virtue, I cannot bear the shocking sight, approbrious To the name of Magistrate— [goes up to him. Vile Rimini, for Captain of the People, Surrounded with this Herd, I blush to call thee, This Herd of hot-brain'd, giddy, headlong Youth! How long wilt thou forget thy awful Post? The trust confided to thee by the People? Rim. What mean'st thou Cosmo? Cos. What mean'st thou Rimini? To lay aside thy bright deputed Majesty, And when thou should'st with an unweary'd Zeal Thro' wakeful Nights, and thro' laborious Days, Be watchful o're the Liberty of Florence, To court, to hugg those Youths, she ought to dread? Are these the Reverend Fathers you consult with About the State of War, the Cities safe-gard? Well may the people with united Votes Accuse thee to the Senate. Rim. Accuse me to the Senate? Cos. Accuse thee? Yes—and all with one Accord Demand thy suddain Banishment. Rim. O! base ingrateful! Cosmo! I find thee here; Thy subtle arts appear in this too plain! Yet I deserve it, for recalling thee! For banishing my Friend the Brave Rinaldo For since I gave thee Pow'r 'twas I that did it.— Yet—If this popular Goverment do's please thee If Florence, ought enjoys by this sad Change To me she owes it. And are these her Thanks? Are these the just Returns she makes for Benefits? —And thou ingratefully are grown my Foe, Striving to crush the Man that made thee great! Cos. Thy Passion not thy Virtue made thee ours, 'Twas thy Revenge; and not the Love of Florence That made thee act at first, as still thou oughtst; But finding, by my Vigilance prevented, Thou coudst not on Rinaldo's Ruin mount, To Tyrannies, thy blind Ambition aimd at, Thy native Vice took Place, and thou lookst back, With a desiring Eye one those curs'd Days, When all but Virtue had a public License. Unable to be great, thou woudst be Wicked. For had the Love of Florence, and of Virtue, Inspir'd thy Soul to do, what thou didst do, Thou still hadst persever'd. But now thou'rt grown The head of Factions, and of Malecontents. Rim. Dawb not thy private Ends, with public Good, Ambitious Cosmo; thou woudst rule alone, And tho thou rail'st at brave Rinaldo's Pow'r, 'Tis but to rise up to Rinaldo's Pow'r. Thou woudst but change the Man, and not the Tyrant. Uber. This shews thy Rancour Rimini. Rim. I shows I dare speak Truth, Which you his Flaterer dare not. Cos. I laugh at thy poor Malice— When I am so, or once in thought Conspire The Bondage of my Countrymen, strike, strike me Y'avenging Pow'rs, tear me O Florence! Piecemeal, And let your Cosmo be more loath'd than he is. Uber. This needed not, the People know thy Virtue. Rim. His Gods the People know indeed their Cosmo. Castr. My Lord pray check your Passion, or you're ruin'd. What here in Public, mid the giddy Rout? Now by our Cause 'tis Madness to contend Retire in time, and watch a Lukyer hour To curb his Pride. Rim. His Insolence I cou'd not bear— Well Cosmo, if the people, as you say, Accuse me, I shall attend the Senate And doubt not but my Innocence will clear me. [Going. Cos. Hold—And e're you go, here listen to your Sentence! By me the Senate banish thee from Florence, If here thou'rt found to Morrow, thou shalt Dye. And to Uberto they have given thy Office. Rim. I go—with Joy from out the Tuscan State, Pleas'd, since I cou'd not save my falling Country, I shall but hear, and not behold its Ruin: But as for thee, her Evil Genius, soon, Soon may'st thou find her Veering Temper, And sink beneath her Frown, whose Smiles betray Thy little Soul to a vain Pride of Empire. Here ev'n in her Bosom, let her crush thee, As she will surely do, if still she's Florence. [Exit with Valori, Lorenzo salutes him. Cos. Ha that Boy! observ'st thou my Uberto? Fawn'd he not on that Rebel, as he went? I fear he is a Weed— Tho' sprung from me; tho' grafted in my stock, But if he prove so; by Heav'n no more but this— Away with him.— I'll tear him up, tho' rooted in my Heart.— Lorenzo. Lor. My Lord. Cos. I say no more of young Ualori I warn'd you too of Adimari. Are my words wind, that thus you let 'em pass? Hast thou forgot thy Father? Lor. No my Lord. Cos. Thou ly'st—but tho' thou scorn the Father's Rod, The Ax may reach thee—think on that!— As if Imperial Toyl were not enough To break my heart, thou add'st thy Disobedience. But by the Pow'rs, that guard this State, I Swear If after double Warning, thou despise me, I'll cast thee from my Blood, nay I'll leave thee Like the most vile offender to the Law. [Exeunt Cosmo and his Train. Lor. Now by those Pow'rs, with which he menac'd me, I here put off all Nature, since he turns me Thus desperate to the World, I do renounce him, And when we meet again, he is my Foe. All Blood, all Reverence, all duty be forgot! Yes from this hour, I all those Tyes disown, Like Jove this sullen Saturn I'll dethrone; And from this Pride of Pow'r, will hurle him headlong down.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Julio's Apartment. Enter Julio, and Teraminta. O! Teraminta! why thus still in Tears? What?—Now the Priest has joyn'd us? oh! my Love! 'Tis ominous—or else thou do'st not love me. Ter. Not love my Julio? O! all ye juster Pow'rs! that know my thoughts! If my sad Soul has tasted any Joy, A hope of Pleasure, but what Julio gave me, Add, add to what I bear, and break my heart, Ev'n here before him; on our Wedding Day. Jul. If mine thou woud'st not break—Oh! Teraminta! Once more I do conjure thee—give the Grave Thy sadness—Let me press thee in my Arms— And lull thy froward Sorrows on my Bosome— —Ha!—Why that Sigh again—these swelling Tears, That in round drops stand ready in thy Eyes? Ter. Oh! Julio!—pardon me my Fears, forgive my Sorrows— Rinaldo is my Father—and I must grieve! His suddain Ruin!—But ah!—perhaps that Grief Too soon I might forget in Julio's Arms. Jul. What farther can disturb thee? Unload thy Cares into my faithful Breast, That if I can't relieve 'em, I may share 'em. Now by my hopes, my Love, you wrong your Julio While you deny your secret Sorrows to him. Ter. Oh! pardon me, my Lord, and I will speak. —You know your Father Cosmo hates Rinaldo, Whom he so lately has expell'd from Florence. You know his hate spreads round to all his Race, That when by Rumour told how thou didst love me, He check'd thy Love, and charg'd thee to renounce me. Jul. 'Twas in a Gust of Passion! Transported with his Zeal against thy Father; He had forgot thy Virtues. Ter. But oh! Julio! Shou'd he again insist upon that Point With all his obstinate severity; What must I fear from his Authority Over a Son so pious, as my Julio? Jul. He knows, this day we're Marry'd, and no more Therefore will think of parting us Ter. Ah! shou'd You Julio, with my Fondness sated, E're yield to throw me off, or in the least Disclose a Coldness to your Teraminta, By all my Fears you surely break my heart! Jul. Banish those groundless Fears, nor think While I have Life I e're can love you less. Ter. Swear then your Love shall last like mine forever. Jul. More, than thou canst desire, I swear to Do!— Ter. Yet do not Swear, it is the common cheat Of faithless Men, that know no other Tye— Thy Love, and Honour are the surest Bands; For Oaths are weaker, than an Infants Tear When that is broke— But I will take so strong a hold with Love, With Tenderness, Obedience, and with Truth Thou shall not have the Power to be false. Jul. Oh! ye just Heav'ns what can you promise me, In vast exchange for this one matchless Woman. Enter Cosmo. Ter. But see—thy Father—I'll not grieve his Eye, Till by my Duty I've destroy'd his Hate. I go—yet 'tis with Pain I leave you with him. Jul. 'Twill not be long—as soon as he is gone I'll call thee to my Arms. [Sees her to the door, and returns to his Father. Cos. Julio! my Son! Jul. My ever honour'd Lord! Cos. I think, my Julio, Nay, by my Soul, I dare protest it to thee, I love thee more, than all my other Children. Jul. How, Sir, oh! how my Lord, have I deserv'd it? Cos. Therefore I love thee more, because, my Son, Thou hast deserv'd it. For, to speak sincerely, There's such a Sweetness still in all thy Manners, An Air so open, and a Brow so clear, With such a manly Plainness in thy Dealing, That not to love thee, O my Son! my Julio! Were to be envious of so great a Virtue. Jul. Oh! all ye Pow'rs! where will this Kindness end? Why do you thus, oh! my most honour'd Lord, Dissolve at once the Being, that you gave me? Unless you mean to Screw me to Performance, Beyond the reach of Man? Cos. Yes, Julio, thou conceiv'st thy Father right, I find our Genij know each other Well. Then to the Shocking Purpose—Once again— I say, I Swear I Love thee, O my Son! I like thy Frame, the Fingers of high Heav'n, I see have left their Mastery upon thee; Yet something they have left for me to finish, Which thus I press thee too, thus, in my Arms, I fashion thee, I mould thee to my Heart— What dost thou kneel? nay then stand up a MAN. Shake from thy Lids the Dew, that hangs upon them, And answer to th'Austerity of my Virtue. Jul. If I must die, my Lord, I am prepar'd, Let then my Fate suffice, but do not rack me, With something more than Death. Cos. Julio, as I remember, you told me you were Marry'd! Jul. My Lord, I did. Cos. To Teraminta, proud Rinaldo's Daughter. Jul. Most true, my Lord, to that poor virtuous Maid, Your Julio, your most unhappy Son Is joyn'd for ever. Cos. No, not for ever— Not but I know the Virgin beautiful, Yet more, my Son, I think her chastly good, most sweetly fram'd, Without the smallest Tincture of her Father; Yet Julio—ha!—what Man?—what all in Tears? Art thou so Soft, that only saying—Yet— Has dash'd thee thus?—nay then I'll plunge thee down, Down to the Bottom of this foolish stream, Whose Brink thus makes thee tremble. No, my Son, If thou art mine, thou art not Teraminta's. Or if thou art, I swear thou must not be, Thou shalt not be hereafter. Jul. Oh! Heav'n! Forgive me Blood, and Duty; all Respects Due to a Father's Name, not Teraminta's? Cos. No, I swear not Teraminta's. No Julio, by th'eternal Fates, that hang, I hope propitious, o're the head of Florence. I'll graple with thee on this very Spot, I'll strugle with thee for this Point of Honour, And tugg with Teraminta for thy Heart; As I have done for Florence—Yes, e're we part Fixt, as you are, by Wedlock joyn'd, and fast, I'll set you far asunder: I'll make thee Swear on this thy Wedding Day, Thou'lt send forth Teraminta to her Father. Jul. Am I a Man! am I not Flesh, and Blood? Cos. I know thou art too much of Flesh, and Blood, 'Tis those I fear, thy Spirit's truly great; Therefore I still am obstinate in this, Thou shalt renounce thy Father, or thy Love. Either resolve to part with Teraminta, Or shake hands with me—part—and be Accurst. Make me believe thy Mother plaid me false, And in my Absence, Stamp'd thee with Rinaldo— Jul. Hold Sir—I do conjure you by your Honour, Curse me not, till you know what I resolve. Too true, O Teraminta, were thy Tears, [Aside. Give me a little Time to rouse my Spirits, To muster all the Tyrant Man about me, All that is fierce, austere, and greatly cruel, To Julio, and his hapless Teraminta! [Sighs. Cos. Remember me!—look on thy Father's Suff'rings, My Banishment, my Losses, and my Toyles! All, All deriv'd from her accursed Father. If thou hast Nature, Worth, or Honour in thee, The Insults I have born from her vile Race, Will stir thee up to this new Act of Glory— [Pauses. Thou want'st the Image of thy Father's Wrongs, Or thou coud'st never think the hated Off-spring Of his worst Foe, shou'd share his purchas'd Glory. [Pauses. I do allow thee fond, young, soft, and gentle, Caught by the Charms of One, that is most lovely. Yet Julio, this must all be lost, when Honour, When Heav'n, and thy Country come to claim thee. Think then, thou heard'st them cry, Obey thy Father. Jul. Break, break my Heart, and save me from this Guilt, O Love! oh Duty! O thou cruel Honour! Each tuggs my Heart—[Pauses in an agony] Oh! mortal be the Pangs! —What is it, Sir, that you wou'd have me Swear? [Pauses again. That I may scape your Curse, and gain your Blessing? Cosm. That thou this Hour will part with Teraminta! For once again, I swear if here she stays. What for the Hatred of the Multitude, And my Resolves t'expel the cursed Faction, Her Person is not safe!—What woud'st thou have her, (Out of thy Childish Dotage) to stay here, To meet the Rage of the insulting People; Behold her dragg'd, and buffeted about; Her beauteous Face besmear'd with Dirt, and Blood, And all her tender Body bruiz'd, and torn, Rather than send her hence, tho' for her safety? Jul. Ha!—That dreadful Image kills me! I cannot bear the Picture of that Horror. Yes I can loose my Teraminta, rather, Than keep her here to these Indignities!— Here take me, Sir, oh! take me e're I cool! I swear this Hour, I'll part with—oh!— My tortur'd Soul!—with—oh! my Teraminta! Cos. So—I trust thy Virtue!— And, by my Hopes, I thank thee for the Conquest, Once more, with all the Blessings, I can give thee, I take thee to my Arms—thus on my Bosome, The hard, and rugged Pillow of thy Honour, I wean thee from thy Love—farewel—be fast To what thou'st Sworn, and I am thine for ever. Jul. To what thou'st Sworn, oh! Heaven! and Earth what's that! What hast thou Sworn?—to part with Teraminta! To part with something dearer to my Heart Than my Life's Drops. Renounce thy Vows!— Those Vows I made before the holy Priest! Ye juster Pow'rs! I did forswear my self In swearing that, and will forswear again. Forsake her!—O! thou perjur'd Braggart!—where? Where are thy Vaunts? thy Protestations now? Enter Teraminta. She comes! to strike thy stagg'ring Duty down!— [Pauses 'Tis faln!—'tis gone!—O Teraminta! come. Come to my Arms, thou only Bliss of Julio! Hush to my Cares, and Balm to all my Wounds, Selected Hour, of All Life's happy Moments! Ter. Oh Julio! I have seen a Sight that shocks me! From out the Window, that o're looks the Market, I saw the Wife of banish'd Rimini, My Cousin, and the Mate of all my Childhood, Chac'd by the Fury of the madding Multitude. Jul. Oh! curs'd Remembrance! of what must undo me!— Into what Times, my Love, our Lot is faln! When wild Erynnis breaths her Plagues around, And with Contagion blasts securest Joys! Ter. What means my Love? Jul. And yet, my Teraminta, we may Smile, Her blew Eruptions can't infect our Bliss; Come, come to Bed, e're yet the Night descends, With her black Wings to brood o're all the World. Why what care we? let us enjoy those Pleasures, That Heav'n has given!—lock'd in each others Arms, We'll lie for ever thus, and laugh at Fate! Ter. No, no, my Lord, there's more than you will own, [Sighs You look, you talk disorderly, and wild! There's something at your Heart, that I must find; I claim it with the Priveledge of a Wife. Keep close your Joys; but for your Griefs, my Julio, I must not, will not loose my share of them. Oh! all my Fears! what is it stirs you thus? Speak, speak, my Lord, or Teramimta dies!— Oh! Heavens! he weeps! nay then upon my Knees, I thus conjure you speak, or give me Death! Jul. Rise Teraminta!—oh! if I shou'd speak What I have rashly Sworn against my Love, I fear that I should give thee Death indeed. Ter. Against thy Love!—No—that's impossible! The Tears you shed; this Agony of Soul Tell me, my Lord, you love, as well as ever. Jul. By all that's just I do—Oh Teraminta! My Heart's Discerner, whither do's Fate drive us? Ter. Oh! my Prophetic Fears!— Jul. Sure I was born beneath the worst, The most malicious Influence of the Stars! Doom'd still to Love, what I must ne'er Enjoy!— O! Father! Father! Why so obstinate, To ruin your most unhappy Julio. Ter. O! gracious Heav'n! what means he? Jul. Why was I made soft, constant, tender, loving? And not, as fickle, as our roving Kind, Whose Vows were ne'er acquainted with their Hearts, And give no Pangs to break 'em. Ter. Oh! Julio, Julio! Ah! whither do's this dismal Prologue tend? But have a care, your Vows are not like theirs! Remember what you promis'd when I left you With your suspected Father? Jul. Ah! Teraminta! let me hide my shame! This perjur'd Wretch dares not behold thy Eyes, Where sure there are such soft, upbraiding Looks, As must quite break my Heart. Ter. You never lov'd me, Julio, never lov'd me! But took a barbarous Pleasure to destroy, With seeming Truth, a fond believing Maid. Jul. Oh? hear me first, and Judge by what you hear! My Father wrought me up—I know not how— To Swear—I know not what— That I this hour wou'd send thee hence with Rimini. Ter. Ah! you are false my Julio!—Mine? no mine no more! Nor wou'd you leave your Falsehood to my Doubts, Your Tongue must make it plain, least my fond Love Shou'd frame some kind mistake. Jul. But hear me out— I stood the shock of all my Father's Anger, His threaten'd Curse, a Father's threaten'd Curse; And only yielded for my Fears for thee. Ter. Oh! wretched Teraminta! Jul. He Swore, there was no Safety for thy Person, If thou staid'st here— That I must let thee go, or see the fall A bloody Victim to the raging People. See thee abus'd, drag'd round the streets, and Slain! Cou'd Julio love, and bear to see that Sight? Ter. Ah! can'st thou think to part with thee is less? To part is Death! to part is Death with Tortures! With Shame, with Infamy, with all, that's odious! Jul. Oh! on what Shelves does my ill Fortune throw me? What ever way I take, I am most wretched! And seeking to preserve, I ruin thee— [Pauses. —Fame! Honour! Duty! all, oh all farewel! Wellcome my Father's Fury, and his Curses! For all are less, and better to be born, Then Teraminta's Doubts of Julio's Love.— [Pauses. —It shall be so—I have this only Way To prove my Love, and yet obey my Father— Yes I will die!—this Poiniard sets me free From all my Woes, and Fears. Draws a Dagger to stab himself, she stops his hand. Ter. Oh! sheath it here! For that's a Proof I never can behold; I do conjure you now, by all the Pow'rs? Which we invok'd together at the Altar, I beg you by the Love I know you bear me, Not to attempt your Life—Oh! all ye Pow'rs! Let me be rather torn in thousand Pieces, Become the Prey of the insulting Croud; Suffer ten thousand Deaths, if possible, Rather, than see you Die. Jul. Oh! Teraminta! Oh— Ter. No, no, my Lord, I now will learn of you, And, to preserve your Life, will loose you. Yes I will go—not all thy Charms shall stay me, Not all my Wishes, and my breaking Heart, That with fierce Love still languishes to Julio. Enter Donato. Don. My Lord—your Father gives you thus in charge— Remember what you Swore—The Guard is ready, And I am order'd to conduct your Bride, While you attend your Father. Jul. Oh! Teraminta! Then we must part? Ter. We must, we must, my Lord, Yet when I'm gone, Ah! think of Teraminta, Think of your wretched Wife; sure your Father Will suffer that—indeed I'll think of you. Jul. Oh! Teraminta I can never leave thee. Ter. You must, my Lord, Therefore be swift, and snatch your self away, Or I shall die with ling'ring. Jul. Oh! one Kiss, Balmy, as Cordials, that recover Souls, Chast as Maids Sighs, and keen as longing Mothers, Preserve thy self, look well to that, my Love, Think on our Covenant—when either dies, The other is no more. Ter. I do remember, but have no Language left. Jul. Yet we shall meet, in spight of Sighs we shall, At least in Heav'n— Oh Teraminta! once more to my Breast, Once to my Lips, and ever to my Heart! [Embracing. Thus the soft Mother, tho' her Babe be dead, Will have the darling on her Bosome laid, Will talk, and rave, and with the Nurses strive, And fond it still, as if it were alive: Knows it must go, yet strugles with the Crowd, And shrieks to see them wrap it in the Shrowd. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Grove in the Cordeliers Garden, where Julio is discover'd lying extended on the Ground in a melancholly posture. Enter Lorenzo, and Fryar Stephen. Lor. Well Fryar Stephen, is my Brother here? Step. My Lord he is. Lor. What brought him? Step. I train'd him hither. Lor. How? Step. I thought these wide, and Solitary Gardens, Wou'd suit his Melancholly, and our Purpose. I sought him long in vain, for Love had forc'd him, Down to the fatal Road, that leads to Milan: Through which his Terimanta just had past: And there I found him lost in Thought profound. Now—with swift steps he went along the Road, As if he wou'd pursue her—Then o'th' sudden— Stop'd in his full Carrier, and stood a while, With his Eyes fixt by Sorrow on the Ground, And then by Rage turn'd up to Heaven— Long I survey'd his Agony of Soul, And long I try'd before I cou'd prevail To get him to our Monast'ry; where enter'd, He shot from me, and fled into these Gardens, And here has been e're since. Lor. 'Tis well,—and are our Friends yet come? Step. Some are, the rest I expect each moment. Lor. Let none but Friends have entrance. Step. That Caution's needless. Lor. Well then retire. Step. I will—but not too far, I know your fiery Temper, that may ruine All we propose, if not by me prevented. [Exit Fryar! Lor. This is the gloomiest part of all the Grove, And here I sure shall find him—Ha! there he lies! Extended on the Margin of the Brook Lost in profoundest Thought!—Oh! Pow'r of Love! That thus converts all to it self, like Fire! Time was, when the loud Trumpet, and the Drum, The Groans of dying Foes, the Victors Shouts, Were his Delight; now Melancholly Airs, And lonely Grotto's are his only Pleasure. But I must rouse him— [Goes to him. What Wretch art thou, that at this dusky Hour Hast chose this hard bleak Lodging? By my Fears My Brother!—Julio! why in this sad Posture? And why these heaving Sighs, and dismal Groans, That add to the brown Horrours of the Grove? Julio, I say, now by my Soul, what means this? Jul. Who e're thou art, that by ill Fortune guided, Dost deviate to the Haunts of my Despair, Begone, and fly me, as thou woud'st the Plague, My Fortune is infectious, the Contagion Will blast thy Happiness, if thou stay near me. Lor. I have no Happiness, while you have none, Thy Brother, and thy Friend wou'd shun Repose, While thy Despair thus shakes thy noble Frame. But come, rise up, my Brother, rise, for shame; For by my Hopes, I wou'd not for the World, That any but my self shou'd find thee thus. What a vile Image wou'd it give of Julio, To be found groaning here beneath a Load That Action shou'd remove—If thou art wrong'd, Thy Virtue, and thy Arm shou'd do thee Right. Julio rises and comes forward. Jul. Oh! my Brother— Lor. I am thy Friend, speak out! Let me but know thy Wrongs, and if I suffer Thee thus to languish, say I am no Friend, Renounce Lorenzo. Jul. Oh! is it possible, Thou shoud'st not know the Cause of all my Woe? Be sure if this Right Hand cou'd do me Justice, Thou had'st not found me here. Lor. When last I saw thee, I at the Altar saw thee, blest with Love; With Teraminta. Jul. Ha! name not Teraminta! If thou woud'st have me keep my stragling Senses. Lor. Why is she false? Jul. Most true. Lor. Or dead! Jul. Ah! dead! To me at least! Oh she is gone! from me she's gone for ever! Lor. Gone? gone whither! how! and for what Reason? Jul. Divorc'd! torn from me! on my Wedding day. Lor. What Force cou'd wrest her from thy Arms? Jul. My Father. Lor. My Father? why shou'd he? Besides you've been Always his Darling; Have you not provok'd him By some strange vile offence? Jul. Oh! never!—never yet did I offend him; Just Heav'n can witness all my unhappy Life. A Piety inviolate I've paid him. Lor. Then 'tis plain Tyranny. Jul. 'Tis indeed Severe. Lor. Severe!—down right Barbarity! Jul. His Hate to her Father, and his Fears for Florence— Lor. What cou'd he hate in her? or what fear from her? A Woman, tender, innocent, and young! Jul. A Soul so soft too!—so remov'd from Mischief— Lor. Come, come 'tis plain, he cou'd not hate, nor fear her; And 'tis meer Lust of Cruelty in his Nature. Jul. What e're it is, he is my Father still! Lor. Because his Children, must we be his Slaves? Jul. Oh! Heav'n! what can I do?—yes,—yes, Lorenzo, I know how much severely I am dealt with, And feel the Rigour of my Slavery; The Agony of Teraminta's Loss!—but— Lor. Her Loss indeed, more truely than you mean!— Where is she gone? what guards her from ill Fortune? The Injuries of Chance? and Hazards of the Camp? Jul. Oh! All ye Pow'rs! Lor. Perhaps you think, she's with her Father safe, But oh! reflect that he's to Milan fled, A Prince, whose Will, whose Fancy is his Law, Nor too much fam'd for keeping of his Word, Or for the Rights of Hospitality, When e're his Lust, or his Ambition prompts him. Jul. Oh! Brother! O Friend! Oh! do not rack my Soul. Lor. But were no Danger there, and lost Rinaldo, Still leading on his Troops against this City. Think that thou saw'st the adverse Armies join'd; Rinaldo beaten; now his Camp surpris'd; Our Souldiers plundring; thy chast Wife a Prize To some vile Slave! the Beauteous Teraminta, With Hair disheveld, swoln, with Tears her Eyes; Her silver Voice grown Hoarse with calling on thee, Calling in vain to free her from the Arms, From the Embraces, of some lustful Villain— Jul. No more—least I grow wild with the dire Image. What can be done to save my Teraminta? Lor. I soon cou'd show the way. Jul. Oh! do it quickly. Lor. Yes cou'd I think you truly Lov'd her. Jul. Love her! Life to her is vile!—shew the Way, Tho' Life, Fame, Glory, all were lost I'd on. Lor. The way I offer brings you no such Hazzards; But Life, Fame, Honour, Glory, Wealth, and Love. Jul. Oh! my best Friend, Restorer of my Peace: Delay not, but inform me. Lor. Remember, If thou let slip that bright occasion,—now 'Tis gone for ever. Jul. Rack me not, proceed. Lor. Florence, you know since first it shook the Yoak O'th' Empire off, was for four Hundred Years Still Govern'd by the Nobles, by them Defended From Foreign Foes, and from Domestick Broils; Thus under their Auspicious Rule she grew In Empire, Fame, and Wealth; till the proud People Uneasy with their Happiness, Rebell'd, And threw their Benefactors from the Helm. What had Ensu'd, but Rapin, and Destruction, Had not some Noble Spirit then arose And Re-inthron'd the Lords! Jul. Prethee no more— Divert this tedious, and unwellcome Tale, And come to what you promis'd. Lor. Know then,—Rinaldo, too generous to sit down With this new Ruin of his Country, comes With a most potent Army to its Rescue. Thousands of Noble Florentines expect him, And tho' the bravest, greatest of our City, All long to call you Chief. Thus you redeem the Errours of our House, Preserve your self and Love—Tho' I am safe, I cannot think I am, while you're in Danger. Jul. So you wou'd have me be a Traytor. Lor. No, I wou'd have you cease to be so—be Loyal— 'Tis Treason to oppose, and not assist Those, that restore our ancient Laws, and Rights. Jul. You have forgot sure, that you have a Father. Lor. When he forgets the Nature of a Father, Which Name implies all Tenderness, and Love; And grows a Tyrant, lays aside all Justice, Truth, Reason, and the Ties of Conscience, I'd cease To think my self his Son. Jul. I say—no more— Least I suspect, you never meant me well. Lor. He is a Man, and by his Passions swaid— Whence else his causeless hate of Teraminta? He is Ambituous too, and Cruel—Witness His poor Descent to court for Pow'r the Vulgar? His Treatment of Rinaldo's House, and thee? Jul. Lorenzo, if yet thou woud'st preserve My Love, or Patience—urge this Point no farther. Lor. If he shou'd please himself with Sacriledge, As well, as Treason; for the public Good Expel Religion, as he has the Nobles, Will Duty bind us to partake his Crimes? Jul. I will not hear thee. Lor. But by your Wrongs you shall. Come, this is Peevishness, meer Biggottry of Duty, 'Tis thy Disease, and I thy Friend will Cure. Jul. Friend!—'tis false!—now by my Soul Lorenzo, Thou hast done basely by me—Wert thou a Friend, And had'st a Cause, that Virtue durst avow, Thou woud'st have taken me in my greatest Calm, And offer'd it to my unruffled Reason. But conscious of the Vileness of the Fact, Thou'st meanly watch'd my Hurricane of Soul, And work'd my Passion to surprize my Honour Into a Crime against my Father; Against my Source of Being. Lor. Against a Tyrant, whom my Soul disowns. Jul. As mine does thee—begone—begone—and leave me— See me no more— Lor. See thee no more?—no obstinate dull Fool, Fond of that Misery, thou canst not bear. Jul. I can bear any thing but thee—begone— Lor. Oh! 'tis thy stupid Slavishness of Temper!— A fawning Spaniels Temper—a Dog's Virtue To lick the hand, that beats him—oh! had'st thou The Spirit of a weak, and puling Girle, Thou coud'st not bear it. Jul. I shall not bear thy Insolence. Lor. 'Tis false—thou wilt, thy Nature's made to bear. Jul. Go to—you're a Boy—a foolish headstrong Boy— Lor. Boy! Jul. A Villain e're a Man. Lor. Villain! ha!— [Claps his hand to's Sword Jul. Why shou'd the Name offend? the thing thou own'st. The Place protects thee, or I wou'd prevent The Ax, the Ax, and punish thee my self. Lor. [Drawing] It is a Cowards Refuge— Else thou durst sooner urge a hungry Lion, Than thus provoke me—But draw—there Is no Refuge for thee here. Jul. Rash Boy. [They draw, enter Fryar Stephen and interposes Step. Now by the Honours of this Sacred Place, What irreligious Fury arms your Hands? My Lord, Lorenzo, you have been to blame. Lor. He urg'd me beyond the Patience of a Coward— But I have done—Go, go, go home—betray, Betray thy Brother, as thou hast done thy Wife: To an inhumane Father offer both. Jul. Repent, repent Lorenzo— For me Thou'rt safe—but oh! repent thy Madness, E're Heav'ns avenging Justice overtake thee. Lor. Repent thee of thy Folly, And think of Teraminta!—so I leave thee [Exit with Priest Jul. Think of Teraminta! ha! that Name Again awakes my Fears; and sets before me The gastly Image of those dreadful Suff'rings, She is expos'd to!—Oh! my Virtue hold! Oh! Piety now hold me firm, and fixt, Or I am lost for ever— [Pauses. Oh! 'tis enough, that I am Miserable, I'll not be guilty too!—ha! not guilty! Have I forgot the Breach of Nuptial Vows, My broaken Oaths to wretched Teraminta! Enter Fryar Stephen with Teraminta. Fryar. You've heard the Pleasure of Lord Rimini, And what he did command, I've sworn to do With this sharp consecrated Poiniard on this spot. [talk together Jul. Throw thy abandon'd Body on the Ground, With thy bear Breast lie wedded to the Dew, Then as thou drink'st the Tears, that trickle from thee, So stretch'd, resolve to lie till Death shall seize thee, Thy sorrowful Head hung o're some tumbling stream, To rock thy Griefs with Melancholly Sounds, With Broaken Murmurs, and redoubl'd Groans, To help the gurgling of the Water's Fall. Ter. I am instructed Since then my Life's at stake, you need not doubt, But I will act with all the Force I can, Let me intreat you leave me here alone Some Minutes, and I'll call you to the conquest. [Exit Priest. Oh! Julio! Ah! what Face of Death is this. Jul. Oh! Heav'n! I cannot bear it! will not bear it? Yes, I will ask the cruel Pow'rs For what bold Sin, they doom the wretched Julio To such a Loss, as that of Teraminta. Oh! Teraminta, I will groan thy Name Till the tir'd Eccho faint with Repetition, Till all the breathless Grove, and quiet Myrtles, Shake with my Sighs, as if a Tempest bow'd 'em. Nothing but Teraminta! Ah my Teraminta! Ter. Nothing but Julio; Julio and Teraminta! [he starts up. Thus let me rob the Fountains, and the Groves, Thus gird thee to me in the fastest Knot [Embraces. Of Arms, and Spirits, that thou wou'd clasp thee through, Cold, as thou art, and wet with Nights faln Dews, Yet dearer so, thus richly dress'd in Sorrows, Then if the God's had hung thee round with Kingdoms. Oh! Julio! oh! Jul. I find thee Teraminta! Wak'd from a fearful Dream, and hold the fast! 'Tis real—and I give thee back thy Joys! Thou boundless Love, with Pleasures running o're, Leap to my Heart, and now defie the Stars. [Embrace. But oh! why do we loose this precious moment? Let's be before hand with our Fortune, and leave Th'unwholesome Damps of this contagious Air. Ter. O Julio! you must hear me first, I bring a Message from my furious Father; I promis'd, nay I was sworn not to touch you, Till I had charm'd you to Rinaldo's Party. Jul. Ha Taraminta! not to touch thy Husband Unless he prove a Villain? Ter. Julio no, I'm sworn to tell you, that you are a Traytor If you refuse to fight the Nobles Quarrel. Jul. Hold Teraminta— Ter. No, my Lord, 'tis plain; And I am sworn to lay my Reasons home. Rouse then, awake; recall your sleeping Virtue. Side with Rinaldo; arm against your Father; Take part with those, who Loyally have Sworn To let him in by Night—Valori, Castrucio, and your Brother are at hand. Therefore I charge you hast, Subscribe your Name, And send your vow'd Assistance to my Father. 'Tis Teraminta, that intreats you thus, Charms and, conjures you; tell them Instantly You'll Head their Enterprize; for you the People Doat on, as sure as all Mankind must. And then my Love, my Lord, I will obey you. Jul. Never, I swear— Oh Teraminta! thou hast broke my Heart, By all my Hopes from thee this was too much! Farewell—and take this with thee—for—thy—sake, I will not Fight against, nor for Rinaldo. I'll fly my Father, Brother, Friends for ever, Forsake the Haunts of Man; converse no more With ought, that's humane. But dwell in endless Darkness; For since the sight of thee is now unwellcome, What can Light show me else, that I can bear? [Going. Ter. Come back, my Lord, by those Immortal Pow'rs We once invok'd, I'll fix you in this Virtue— And if thy Teraminta, by the Frailty Of Sex, and Love betray'd, cou'd wish for Life A while to enjoy her much lov'd Lord, her Julio: Do but reflect; remember she's a Woman, The natural Slave to Fear, and fond Desires. But since I find thee obstinate in Virtue, I'll die to root thee in this solid Glory! Yes, yes, my Julio, tho' my Death is Sworn, I'll never press thee more to be unfaithful. Jul. Thy Death, and Sworn! by whom? where? how? Ter. The African Bridge I scarce, as yet had reach'd, When Rimini my Cousin banish'd hence, This very day o're took me— Drove me aside into his Country Villa, And swore me to attempt thy honour thus. Won more by hopes of seeing thee again, If but to die with thee, than aw'd by Threats, I yielded to his Will. He in the Dusk of Ev'ning brought me back, And gave to Fryar Stephen this Commission, To stab me in your Presence if not wrought To serve the Nobles Cause; but by your Honour Keep to that Point your Constancy has gain'd. Jul. Oh! all ye Pow'rs! Ter. Yet oh! my Julio, if you see Rinaldo Hereafter with his Wounds upon the Earth, Julio for my sake, for poor Teraminta, Who rather dy'd, than you shou'd loose your Honour. Do not you strike him, do not dip your Sword In his dear Blood, because he was my Father. Jul. No Teraminta, no by all my Hopes, I will defend him ev'n against my Father. See see, my Love, behold the Flight I take; What all the Ties of Brotherhood, and Friendship? What all the Charms of thy expected Bed Cou'd not once move my Soul to think of acting? Thy Tears, and menac'd Death, by which thou striv'st To fix me in the Principles of Glory, Have wrought me off. Ter. Is then your purpos'd honour come to this. Jul. Thy Death! thy Death, my Love, I'll think on that, and laugh at boasted Honour, Glory, Blood, Nature, Ties of Reverence, The Dues of Birth, Respect of Parents, all, All are, as this the Air I drive before me. What Hoa! Castrucio, and Valori come, And thou, O! Fatal Priest make hast, approach, I'm ready for the Leap, I'll take it with you, Tho' deep, as to the Fiends. Ter. Thus hear me Julio. [Kneels. Jul. Off from thy Knees away; What on this Theam thy Death, and stab'd before me! Enter Fryar Stephen, Lorenzo, Castrucio, Valori. Speak not—I will not hear thee on this Subject. O Lorenzo! excuse thy Brother's Frailty, Nor think I lov'd thee less, for yielding now Unmov'd by thee!—Upbraid me not Lorenzo, But tho' I'm lost, oh! save thy self my Brother! And leave me to my single Ruin! Lor. No, no, my Friend, if Ruin must attend thee, I'm pleas'd to fall with thee— Jul. Castrucio, and Valori, wellcome, wellcome! I'll joyn you in this Conjuration—come, I am as free, as he that dares be formost. Ter. My Lord! my Husband! Jul. Take this Woman from me! Nay look you Sirs, I am not yet so gone, So headlong neither into this Design, To quench my horrid Thirst, with Cosmo's Blood. No, by th'eternal Pow'rs I bar you that. My Father shall not bleed. Lor. You cou'd not think Your Brother sure so monstrous in his kind, As not to make his Father's Life his Care. Jul. Thus then, my Lords, I list my self among you, And with my Pen, in short, subscribe my self Rinaldo's Servant—The words are these. Julio to Rinaldo. Sir, you need only know my Brother's mind To judge of mine, who am resolv'd to serve you. Step. 'Tis full enough. Exeunt all but Julio and Teraminta. Jul. Then leave me to the hire Of this hard Labour; to the dear bought Prize, Whose Life I purchass'd with my Loss of Honour. Come to my Breast thou Tempest beaten Flow'r Brim full of Rain, and stick upon my Heart! Oh! short liv'd Rose! yet I some hours will wear thee, Yes by yon Stars, I'll smell thee till I languish, Rifle thy Sweets, and run the o're and o're, Fall like the Night upon thy folding Beauties, And clasp the Dead; then like the Morning Sun, With a new Heat kiss thee to Life again, And make the Pleasure equal to the Pain. Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Hall in Castrucio's House. Scene Opens, and Conspirators, as in Consult, Lorenzo, Castrucio, Adimari, Valori, Fryar Stephen, &amp;c. Lor. All Hands have here Subscrib'd, and that your Hearts Prove resolute to what your Hands have written, Behold the Messenger of Heav'n, this good Priest, To bind you with most Holy Vows, and Oaths Not to Disclose, or make least Sign, or Show Of what you have both Heard, and Seen, and Sworn, But bear your selves as if it ne'r had been. Step. Swear then, by all the Powers Celestial, Not to reveal, tho' Racks were set before you, A Syllable of what is past, and done. All. We Swear. Enter Julio. Jul. What, hoa! Lorenzo, give me back my Hand, Good Heav'n awake you to Repentance, As it has me! Woudst thou believe it Brother? Since I deliver'd thee that fatal Scroul, That cursed Writing, my Heart rebell'd Against it self, my Thoughts were up in Arms, My Reason, and my Faculties were Wreck'd, My Body, like the Hull of some lost Vessel, Beaten and tumbled with my rolling Fears, Therefore I charge thee give me back my Writing. Lor. What means my Brother? Jul. May I be doom'd ev'n to the worst of Fates, If I enjoy'd the Beauties, that I sav'd; The Horrors of the Treason shock'd my Joys, And I lay colder by her Side, than Marble, As if I'd drunk the Blood of Elephants, Drowsy Mandragora, or the Juice of Hemlock. Step. I like him not, I think we'd best dispatch him. Jul. Nothing but Images of Horror round me, Florence in Blood, the ravish'd Matrons raving, Enclosures broke, and all the dismal Havock Of Towns permitted to the Vengeful Sword. Therefore, I say, return me my Writing; For I will have it. Enter Liberto, and Lando with Guards Lan. 'Twas here I left them, And came to you, lest Cosmo should not hear me, His Sons being with them. See, Here they are. Uber. Seize 'em all. [Guards seize 'em. Horror upon me, what will this Night bring forth? Yes, ye immortal Pow'rs, strike, strike Uberto, Since these are here!—Julio and Lorenzo! Oh! From this time let me be Blind and Dumb! But hast there, Odo, fly, call hither Cosmo! [Exit Odo. Bid him for ever leave the Down of Rest, And Sleep no more. If Florence were on Fire, Rinaldo in the Streets, dealing round Slaughter, He wou'd less wonder, than at Julio here. Jul. Stop there! Oh! Stop that Messenger of Fate, Here bind, Uberto, bind this Villain's Hands, Tear off my Robes, and lash me like a Slave, Or like a Robber, hang me on a Gibbet, Rack me a Year within some horrid Dungeon; I do submit this Traytor, this Curs'd Villain, To all the Stings of most ingenious Tortures, So thou dispatch me e're my Father comes. But hark! I hear the Tread of Fatal Cosmo! I cannot bear his Face, away with me— Or like a Whirlwind, I'll tear my Way, I care not whither. [Is Guarded out. Uber. Go, my Good Lando, go, and stop the People, Get 'em together to the Palace Gate; Where all the Senate, early in the Morning, Will see strict Justice done upon the Traitors. For thee the State shall give thee due Rewards, Great as thy Service. Lan. I humbly thank your Lordship. [Exit. Enter Cosmo attended. Cosm. O my Uberto! Are these Horrors true? Hast thou this Night embowel'd me? Ransack'd thy Cosmo's Veins, And found two Villains lurking in my Blood? Uber. The blackest Treason that e'er Darkness bred, And who to hatch these Horrors for the World, Who to seduce the Noble Youths of Florence, To draw 'em to so Damn'd a Conjuration, And bind 'em too with, Oaths, but this Good Man? This Messenger from Heaven? Cos. Now all the Fiends reward him for it. Away with them, to the Prison bear 'em. [Exeunt Conspirators Guarded. Read the Packet ore. I'll bear it as I'm able, read 'em out. Uberto reads.] The Sum of the Conspiracy—To Rinaldo. It shall begin with all the Senates Death, Cosmo, and Uberto too must bleed, And every Man that stands against the Nobles. Be ready therefore, Sir, to send your Troops By Twelve to Morrow Night, and come your self In Person, if you'd have our Cause succeed. All, that have Sworn to venture ev'n their Lives For This Design, subscribe themselves your Servant, Lorenzo, Adimari, and Valori, Castrucio, Barbadori, and Bernardo, Fryer Stephen, Prior of the Cordeliers. Cos. Ha! my Uberto! Is not Julio there? Uber. He's here my Lord, a Paper by himself. Julio to Rinaldo. Sir, you need only know my Brother's Mind To Judge of me, who am resolv'd to serve you. What do you think my Lord? Cos. Think, my Uberto; By my Heart I know not, I'm at a Loss of Thought! But my Uberto, wonder not at Cosmo, If thou behold him shed unmanly Tears, To see his Blood, his Children, his own Bowels, Conspire the Death of him that gave 'em Being. Uber. Oh! no,—I Wonder more You bear it thus, That your Heart breaks not with th'unusual Sorrow. Cos. Not to be mov'd, with such prodigious Suff'rings, Were not to be a Man, or have his Passions,— [Pauses. Yet O Uberto! tho' I own the Man, M'Ambitious Soul now struggles up to Glory, Uncommon Glory, and a bright Ambition. O Brutus! Brutus! thou inspir'st my Soul! Yes, Since the hard Necessity of State, And the immortal Pow'rs themselves Decree There must be Patterns drawn of Noblest Virtue, Cosmo submits to the eternal Doom. Uber. Can I believe there can be such Perfection Ev'n in an Age so profligate as this? Cos. First, As I am their Father, I forgive them, I pardon, both of them, this black Design; But, as I am the Father of my Country, To whom sh' intrusts her Safety, I abhor 'em, And cast them from my Soul with Detestation, The nearer to my Blood, the deeper Guilt. Enter Teraminta. Nay, I will stand unbowell'd at the Altar! See something dearer to me, than my Entrails The Sacrifice to Justice. Ter. What Sacrifice? what Victims? Sir, are these? Which you intend? O ye eternal Pow'rs! How shall I vent my Sorrows? Oh! my Lord! Yet e'er you sign the Death, you have design'd, The Death of all that's lovely in the World, Hear what the Witness of his Soul can say; The only Evidence, that can, or dare Appear for your Unhappy, Guiltless Son; Just Heaven commands you, Virtue, Truth and Justice, Which you with so much Rigour have ador'd; Beg you wou'd hear the wretched Teraminta. Cos. Cease thy Laments, tho' of Rinaldo's Blood, Yet more the Wife of my forgotten Son; Thou shalt be heard. Ter. Have you forgot him then? Have you forgot your self? the Image of you? The moving Greatness of your Eyes? their Mercy, Their yielding Goodness! not quite so severe! Yet still most like, and can you then forget him? Cos. Will you proceed? Ter. My Lord, I will—know then After your Son,—your Son, that loves you more, Than I love him; after our common Julio, The Wealth o'th' World, unless you rob it of him, Had long endur'd th'Assaults of the Rebellious, And still kept fixt to what you had enjoin'd him; I, as Fate order'd it, was sent back by Rimini, With my Death menac'd, ev'n before his Eyes, Doom'd to be Stabb'd, before him, by the Priest, Unless he yielded not t'oppose the Nobles. Consider, Sir, Oh! make it your own Case, Just Wedded, just on th'expected Joys, So loving too, alas! as we do love, Granted in haste, in Heat, in Flame of Passion, He knew not what himself, and so subscrib'd. Uber. Go on, now, by my Soul, your Son is Innocent! Ter. But now, Sir, now, my Lord, behold a Wonder, Behold a Miracle to move your Soul! Tho' in my Arms, her Arms so much he doated on, His noble Heart struck with the Love of Cosmo, Of what he promis'd you, 'till then forgot, Leapt in his Breast, and dash'd him from his Joys. He started, and cryed out—Y' Immortal Powers! What have I done? No, Teraminta, let us rather perish, Divide for ever, with whole Seas betwixt us, Rather, than Sin against so good a Father! Tho' he before condition'd for your Life, Yet would not trust the Traitors with the Safety Of him he call'd the Image of High Heav'n. Uber. Oh! Saint-like Virtue of a Wife. Now all the Arts of Women's Tongues inspire thee, Inspire thy soft, and tender Soul to move him! Ter. On this he rose, Swore by the Pow'rs Divine He wou'd fetch back the Paper, that he gave, Or leave his Life among them. Kept his Word, And came to challenge it—but Oh! too late! For in the midst of all his Piety, His strong Perswasions to a swift Repentance, Lando approach'd, who had before alarm'd The Wise Uberto, who with all the Guards Found Julio here, believ'd him like the rest, And seiz'd him too as Guilty. Uber. But by my Hopes, my Soul acquits him now! Blest be thy Tongue, and blest th'auspicious Pow'rs That sent thee, O true Pattern of Perfection, To plead his bleeding Cause! There needs no more! I see his Father's mov'd!—Behold a Joy, A watry Comfort rising in his Eyes! That says, 'tis more than half a Heav'n to hear thee. Cos. Haste O Uberto, haste, and send for Julio! [Exit Uberto. Ter. For Julio! Oh! That is a Word too distant! Say for your Son, for your beloved Son; The Darling of the World, the Joy of Heav'n, The Hope of Ages past, and Bliss of those to come, Your Soul's best Wish, and comfort of your Age. Enter Uberto and Julio. Jul. Oh! Whither shall I run to hide me? Where shall I lower fall? How shall I lie More groveling in your View, and howl for Mercy? Yet 'tis some Comfort to my wild Despair, Some Joy in Death, that I may kiss your Feet, And swear upon them by these streaming Tears; Black as I am, with all my Guilt upon me, I never harbour ought against your Person, Ev'n in the height of my Distraction. Your Life, my Lord was Sacred, ever Dear, And ever precious to unhappy Julio. Cos. Rise Julio! rise my Son! Jul. Alas! I dare not! I have not Strength enough to see the Majesty, That I have brav'd. If thus far I aspire, If on your Knees I hang, and vent my Groans, It is too much, too much for thousand Lives. Cos. I pity thee, my Son, and I forgive thee, And that thou mayst believe my Mercy true; I take thee to my Arms. Jul. Oh! All you heav'nly Powers! Ter. Ah! See, Sir, see against his Will! Behold He does Obey, tho' he wou'd chuse to kneel! Now by my hopes of Mercy, he's so lost, His Heart's so full, brimful of Tenderness, The Sense of what you've done, has struck him Speechless. Nor can he thank you now but with his Tears. Cos. My dear Uberto, let me now intreat thee, Withdraw a while with gentle Teraminta, And leave us to our selves, Ter. Ah! Sir, I fear you now! Nor can I leave you, with the humble Julio; Unless you promise me you will not chide, Nor fall again to Anger; Do not, Sir, Do not upbraid his Soft and Melting Temper With what is past. Behold he Sighs again! My Heart forebodes a Storm, I know not why: But say, my Lord, give me your Godlike Word: You'll not be cruel, I'll not trust my Heart; Howe'er it leaps, and fills me with new Horror. Cos. I promise thee. Ter. I thank you, Sir; Ev'n from my Soul, I thank you for this Goodness, The great, good, gracious Pow'rs reward, and bless you! Ah! Julio! Ah! my Soul's perpetual Pleasure! I fear I leave thee with too hard a Usurer;— But I perforce must trust him.—O Farewel! [Exit with Uberto. Cos. Well, Julio, Speak,—How is it with thee now? I wou'd attend; a while, this mighty Motion, Wait till the Tempest is quite over-blown, That I might take thee in the Calm of Nature, Thy Agony of Soul quite hush'd, and still. Speak then, and tell me, Oh! my best belov'd! My Son, my Julio, Is all well again? Jul. So well, that I cou'd wish to die this Moment; For that I must, my Virtue, and my Reason At once assure me. That were, indeed, to make you Reparation, And in Your Justice, blot out my Disgrace; And that for Julio too wou'd be most Happy. Cos. How's that, my Son, wou'd Death for thee be Happy? Jul. Most certainly, for in my Grave, I 'scape All those Affronts, which I in Life must look for, All those Reproaches, which the Eyes, and Fingers, And Tongues of Florence daily will cast on me. From whom, to a Soul so sensible as mine Each single Scorn wou'd be far worse, than Death. To hear the pointing People mark me out: That, that is he, that with the Sons of Riot, Conspir'd against his Father and his Country! Oh! Heaven! I cannot bear th'opprobrious Thought! Here, here, my Lord, here sheath your Vengeful Dagger! Oh! By a speedy Death from your dear Hand, Preserve your Son, preserve the wretched Julio! From Stings of Conscience; from Racks of Infamy, That must for ever Torture my Remembrance; By day pursue me, haunt me in the Night, Casting my blotted Honour in my Way, Where-e'er my Melancholy Thoughts shall guide me. Cos. But is not Death a very dreadful thing? Jul. Not to a Mind resolv'd; to me, Sir, It seems as Natural, as to be Born. Yes, Sir, I call th'offended Powers to Witness, Julio dares die, if you have so decreed, To make your Justice famous through the World. Cos. Alas! my Julio! fain I would preserve thee, The Glory, and the Comfort of my Age! Jul. Impossible! Oh! Sir, it is impossible! Not but your Pow'r perhaps might set me free; But then both You and all the Medici Must fall a Sacrifice to Changing Florence, Florence, instable as the Wind, and Seas! And only to be fixt by Cosmo's Virtue. Cos. Oh! Julio! Thou absolute Young Man! Thou flattering Mirror of thy Fathers Image, Where I behold my self to such Advantage! Thou perfect Glory of the Medici, Let me endear thee once more to my Bosome. Here press thee Close, close to my sad Heart, Groan an eternal Farwel to thy Soul; Instead of Tears, weep Blood if possible, Blood! the Heart Blood of Cosmo on his Child! For thou must die, my Julio, die my Son! I swear that Fate has doom'd thee to the Grave. The violated Genius of thy Country, Rears his sad Head, and passes Sentence on thee. This Morning Sun, that lights my Sorrows on To the Tribunal of this horrid Vengeance, Shall never see thee more. Jul. Alas! my Lord! Why are you mov'd thus? Why am I worth your Sorrows? Why should the godlike Cosmo shake to doom me? Why all these Trappings to a Traitor's Hearse? The Fates will have it so. Cos. They will my Julio!— Nay Heav'n and Earth combine to have it so. Yes, Julio, mark me,—the deeper that I search, My harrass'd Soul returns the more confirm'd. Florence not more remark'd is for her Valour, Than her Divisions, and domestic Jarrs, That hitherto have circumscrib'd her Glory, And cramp'd it up into a narrow Compass, Those, by Proscriptions Sprung from private Hate, Have robb'd her of Ten thousands of her Children, And Scatter'd them abroad thro' all the World, Teaching our Foes our Virtues. The Factions of the Nobles, and Plebeians, Alternately Victorious, have made pale Florence For rolling Ages look like Sylla's days, She hourly views the Slaughter of her Sons To stop this Ruin, and my Country save. Methinks I see the very Hand of Heav'n Like a Machine now hurle me to thy Death. It seems as if that Fate had pre-ordain'd it, To fix the reeling Spirits of this People, By giving both my Sons up to the Ax. Jul. The Ax! Oh! Heav'n! Then must I fall so basely? What, shall I perish by the common Hang-man? Cos. If thou deny me this, thou giv'st me nothing. Yes, Julio, since the Heav'ns have so decreed That I must lose thee;—I will take th'Advantage Of thy important Fate; cement our Flaws, And heal our wounded Freedom with thy Blood. I will ascend my self the sad Tribunal, And sit upon my Sons; on thee my Julio. Behold thee suffer all the Shame of Death; The Hang-man's Lashes, Bleed before the People, Then in the midst of this bright dawn of Youth, See thy Head sever'd by the Common Ax, Without a Groan, without a pitying Tear; Yes if my Virtue hold me to my Purpose, Jul. Scourg'd like a Vulgar, Rascal Criminal! But I deserve all!—yet here I fail! The Image of this Suffering quite Unmans me, Nor can I longer stop the gushing Tears. Oh! Sir! Oh! Cosmo! Must I call you Father, Yet have no Token of your Tenderness? No Sign of Mercy? What not bate me that? Can you resolve?—Oh! all the Extremity, Of Cruel Rigour!—to behold me too!— Ah! Sir! Why shou'd you make my Heart suspect, That all your late Compassion was dissembl'd? How can I think that you did ever love me? Cos. Why Felons every Day die unconcern'd; It is thy Shame, thy publick Infamy, Thy most peculiar Punishment must fix My Justice, and in that this State, and People, Aw'd by this Terror from their veering Temper. Yet think I love thee, by my present Passion, By these unmanly Tears; these Earthquakes here; These Sighs, that twitch the very Strings of Life!— Think that no other Cause on Earth cou'd move me To Tremble thus, to Sob to shed a Tear. Nor shake my solid Virtue from its Point, But Julio's Death!—Julio the Joy of Cosmo, His Soul, and dearer far, than Life it self, By the just Pow'rs, I feel thy Pangs, and Throbs, Thy Pains of Body, Agonies of Soul, In a most exquisite Degree, Oh!— [Pauses. I own thy Suff'rings ought to unman me thus, To make me throw my Body on the Ground, To tear my Hair, and curse the Cruel Fates That force a Father thus to dragg his Bowels. Jul. Oh! Rise thou violated Majesty, Rise from the Earth, or I shall begg those Fates, Which you wou'd Curse, to bolt me to the Centre. I now submit to all your threatn'd Vengeance, And own the sad Necessity, compells it, Come forth ye Executioners of Justice, Come all ye Slaves, ye common Hang-men come, Come strip me bare, unrobe me in his Sight, And lash me till I bleed; whip me like Furies, And when you've Scourg'd me till I Foam, and Fall, For want of Spirits groveling in the Dust, Then take my Head, and give it his Revenge; By the just Pow'rs, I greedily resign it. Cos. No more—but think when next we meet At a more awful Distance, think, my Son, The Pangs thou giv'st thy wretched Father's Soul, Are greater far to hide my raging Pain, Than if I cou'd have Vent in raving Cries, And fall upon thy Neck, and curse my Fortune. Jul. No more, my Lord, your Julio is prepar'd, Ready to give his Life up to your Justice. Cos. Why then no more, my Son.—but—Oh—Farewel! Eternally Farewel! Th'immortal Pow'rs will sure preserve a Room, A Throne for thee above,—one last Embrace.— What is it makes thy Eyes thus Swim again? Jul. I had forgot,—be good to Teraminta, When I am Ashes.— Cos. Leave her to my Care. See her thou must not, for thou canst not bear it. Oh! for one more! this pull, this Tug of Heartstrings! Farewel for ever. Jul. O! Cosmo! Oh! my Father! Cos. Canst thou not say Farewel? Jul. Farewel for ever! Cos. For ever then.—But Oh my Tears run ore! Groans choak my Words, and I can Speak no more! [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Piaza near the Palace. Enter Uberto, Donato, Odo, Alidossa. Don. His Sons condemn'd! Uber. Doom'd to the Whip, and Ax. Don. What both of them? Uber. Both, Sir, both his Sons. Don. What Julio too? Uber. Yes, Sir, his darling Julio. Nay tho' he knows him innocent as I am, 'Tis all one, Sir, his Sentence stands like Fate. Don. Yet I'll intreat him. Odo. So will I. Al. And I. Uber. Intreat him! Yes, my Lords, you may intreat him, As I have done; he is no more a Man; He is not cast in the same common Mould; His Spirit moves not, with our Springs, and Wards, But fir'd with a glorious Emulation Of the old Roman Glory, stands unmov'd. Odo. What can be done then? For it grieves my Soul To think of Julio's Loss. Uber. There is no help: And yet I have engag'd the Mournful Mother To plead the Cause of her Unhappy Sons. Enter Julio, Hangmen, Guards, &amp;c. But see, O Heav'n! Behold the gallant Julio, The Mirror of all Sons, the White of Virtue, Fill'd up with Blots, and writ all ore with Blood, Bowing with Shame, his Body to the Ground. Oh! Julio! Is this possible? this Shame! Jul. Oh my Uberto! call it not my Shame! By all the Pow'rs, it is to Julio Honour; My constant Suff'rings, are my only Glory. What have I left besides? But Oh! far better shall I bear my Death, The easier end of Pain, and of Dishonour. Enter Teraminta wounded, and her Hair disheveled. Ter. Where is he? Where is this Godlike Son Of an Inhumane, Barbarous, Bloody Father? Oh! bear me to him! Jul. Ha! Teraminta!— There wanted only this to fill my Woe! Is't possible, the very Boast of Beauty Defil'd, and mangled thus! What barbarous Wretch Has thus blasphem'd this bright Original? Ter. For me it matters not, nor my Abuses; But Oh! For thee! Why have they us'd thee thus? The Glory of the World, thus basely us'd. And did thy Father doom thee thus? Oh Julio! Forgive thy dying Part, if she believes A Wretch so barbarous ne'er cou'd be thy Father. Jul. Oh! this last Wound! this Stab to all my Courage! Hadst thou been well, I cou'd have born more Lashes! And is it thus my Father do's protect thee? Ter. Ah! Julio! What thy Murderer, my Protector? No; Let me fall again among the People, Rather, than he protect me! Let me be hooted like a Common Strumpet, Toss'd as I was, and dragg'd about the Streets; The Crie of all the Blood-hounds that did hunt me, Ev'n to this Goal of Death, as thy Seducer, This happy End of all my Miseries! Here to breath out my last, to Wash thy Gashes, To wash thy streaming Wounds, with Farewel Tears, To Murmur, Sob, and lean my Aking Head On thy dear Breast, and there send forth my Soul. Enter Honoria, and Matrons Mourners, &amp;c. Hon. Come Ladies haste, and let us to the Senate, For we by Heav'ns Permission, will to day, Be part of the Assembly!—Oh! my Son!— See here the bloody Justice of a Father! See how his Vengeance rains on his own Bowels! Is he not Mad?—If he refuse to hear us, We'll bind his Hands, as one bereft of Reason. Haste then,—Oh! Julio! I wou'd stay to Moan thee, But that I fear his Orders are gone out For something Worse; for Death!—to take the Heads Of all the Kindred of these Wretched Women. Ter. Come then, I think, I have some Spirits left To join thee, O! most Pious! best of Mothers! To melt his Rocky Heart!—give me your Hand.— Thus let us march before this wretched Hoast, And offer to that God of Blood our Vows. If there be ought that's Humane left within him, Perhaps my Wounds, and horrible Abuses, Help'd by the Tears, and Groans of this sad Troop, May batter down the best of his Resolves. Jul. Hark, Teraminta! Ter. No, my Lord, away. [Exeunt Women. Jul. Oh! my Uberto! Was there ever day Through all the Legends of recorded Time, So sad as this? But see my Father comes! Enter Cosmo, follow'd by Lorenzo, Executioners, Guards, &amp;c. Lorenzo too has undergone the Lash, Give him the Patience Heav'n of Martyr'd Julio, And he will bless those Hands that have chastis'd him. Lor. Enjoy the bloody Conquest of thy Pride, Thou barbarous Sire of these unhappy Sons! Thou impious Saturn, or more black Thyestes: This Cormorant sees, and owns us for his Sons Yet preys upon us, With Thirst of Blood, and Hunger fetch'd from Hell. But end Barbarian, end thy horrid Vengeance, Which thou so impiously hast begun. Perfect thy Justice, as thou Tyrant call'st it, Sit like a Fury, on thy black Tribunal, Grasp, with thy monstrous Hands, these goary Heads, And let thy flattering Orators adore thee, For Triumphs, that Barbarians wou'd disown. Cos. Lead to the Palace. Lor. Go to the Palace then— There make thy Boasts how thou hast doom'd thy Children To Whips, and Ax, for which just Heav'n reward thee! Away,—my Spirit scorns more Conference with thee. The Ax will be as Laughter,—but the Whips, That drew these Stains, for this—I begg of Heav'n, With my last Breath, for every Drop, that falls From these vile Wounds, to thunder Curses on thee. [Exit Guarded. Cos. Uberto haste, the Senate does attend us. [Exit cum suis. Jul. Uberto e'er you go, let me conjure you By all the Earth holds honourable, Grant to thy dying Julio one request. Ub. I'll grant thee any thing; but do not talk Of dying Yet; for much I dare confide In that sad Company, that's gone before. I know they'll move him to preserve his Julio. For tho' you mark'd him not, as hence he parted, I cou'd perceive, with Joy, a silent Shour Run down his Silver Beard.—Therefore I hope— Jul. Hope say'st thou? Oh! Heav'nly Powr's! hope Life!— To live! to live! and after this Dishonour! No, my Uberto, do not make me rave! But if thou hast a Soul, that's sensible, Let me conjure thee when we reach the Palace To thrust me through the Heart. Uber. Not for the World. Jul. Do't or I swear thou hast no Friendship for me. First, Thou wilt save me from the hated Ax, The Hangman's Hands! for by yon Heav'n! I tell thee Thou mayst, as well go stop the rapid Sun, And drive him back, as turn my Father's Purpose. Next, and what more my Soul intreats thee for, I shall perhaps in Death procure his Pity; For to die thus, beneath his killing Frown, Is damning me before my Execution. Uber. I will consider. Jul. As you are Captain of the People, The Law secures you in a Deed like this; For Execution is your proper Province, Tho still in Vulgar Fates to others 'tis deputed. Uber. 'Tis granted!—By my Soul I swear to end thee. For when I weigh, with my more serious Thought, Thy Father's Conduct in this dreadful Justice, And the Necessity of our State, I find it is impossible to save thee. Jul. Let me clasp thee; Boil out my Thanks, thus with my Farewell Spirits,— [Embracing. And now away,—the Taper's almost out, Never, Uberto, to be lighted more— Lead on then,—and don't forget thy Promise. Exeunt Omnes. Scene the Palace, the Senate Sitting. Cosm. Most awful Fathers, that my Sons are Traitors, Their Tongues, and Hands are Witnesses confess'd; Therefore I have already past their Sentence, And wait with you to see their Execution. Donat. Cosmo, The Senate do not ask their Deaths, They are content with what's already done, And all intreat, you wou'd remit the Ax. Cos. I thank you Fathers, but refuse the Favour. By the Assaulted Majesty of Florence, I swear there is no way to quit the Grace, To right the Common-wealth, attone just Heav'n, But by the Sacrificing of my Sons. Take then, ye sad Revengers of the Publick, These Traitors hence, strike off their Heads, and then, My Sons,—no more,—their Doom is past—away;— Thus we shall stop the Course of curs'd Sedition, When none is safe by being great, if Guilty. O! Reverend Fathers! 'tis on this Foundation, Florence shall build her future Peace and Safety. Don. Excellent Cosmo, the Senate thank thee. Enter Honoria, Teraminta, with the rest of the Mourners, follow'd by Uberto, Julio, &amp;c. and Cosmo, a little Boy in Arms. Hono. Gone! gone to Death! already Sentenc'd! doom'd To lose the Light of this Dear World already! What my Lorenzo too! Oh Barbarous Cosmo! Send, haste, revoke the Order of their Fate! By all the Pledges of our Marriage-Bed, If thou inhumane Judge hast left me any To put thee yet in Mind, thou art a Father!— Speak to him, Oh! ye Mothers of sad Florence! Sisters and Daughters, e'er the Execution Of all your Blood! haste, haste, and run about him; Groan, Sob, howl out the Terrors of your Souls; Nay, flie upon him like robb'd Salvages, And tear him from your Young. Cos. Away and leave me, Hon. Or if you think it better for your Purpose, Because he has the Pow'r of Life, and Death, Entreat him thus, throw all your heartless Breasts Low at his Feet, and like a God adore him; [All Kneel. Nay, make a Rampier round him, with your Bodies, And block him up. I see he wou'd be going;— Yet that's a Sign, that our Complaints have mov'd him. Continu'd falls of ever streaming Tears, Such, and so many of the chastest too Of all the Pious Matrons throughout Florence, Perhaps may melt his Adamantine Temper.— Not yet; nay hang your Bodies then upon him, Some on his Arms, and some upon his Knees, And lay this Innocent about his Neck, This little smiling Image of his Father, See how he Bends, and Stretches to his Bosom, Oh! all ye pittying Pow'rs! the Darling weeps, His prety Eyes, Ruddy, and Wet with Tears, Plead for our Griefs, more than, a Thousand Tongues. Cos. What hoa! without there: Are my Orders heard? Don. Oh! Cosmo see! they are too well perform'd! See there the Bodies of the Guilty Youths! All headless by thy Doom! and here Lorenzo's! Tera. See, Sir! Behold! is not this horrid Slaughter, This cutting off one Limb from your own Body Enough to satisfy the most bloody Law? Oh! turn your Eyes! Oh! turn a Father's Eyes On my poor Guiltless Julio! Cos. I must not hear you. Ter. Oh! indeed you must, Not hear the Voice of Nature? that were impious; Not spare the guiltless? that were most unjust. [Going to Julio. Look here my Lord, Oh! see his gushing Blood! Enough to expiate Ten thousand Crimes, Oh! Surely then for a Mistake too much! Cos. Hark Uberto. Ter. Oh! Julio! joyn thy Prayers, and Tears mith mine. [Turning to Julio. For my sake Julio; if thou dost not hate me Or wou'dst relieve me from the worst of Racks! Oh! Sir! Oh! Cruel Cosmo! I implore you [Turning to Cosmo. By all these Wounds upon my Virgin Breast, Which I have suffer'd by your Cruelty, Altho' you promis'd Julio to defend me, Spare him, and I forgive it all! Cos. Observe my Order. Ter. Or if your Justice still requires more Lives, Take mine, take mine, for only I am Guilty! 'Twas I betraid him to this fatal Error. Oh! that I'd perish'd by a Thousand Daggers, By Scourges, Racks, variety of Torments, Ere to that Tryal by my Fears betraid. Jul. Have Patience, my Dear Love, all will be well. Ter. Patience! I would have none! Let Grief and Rage Swell to th'enormous Height of wild Distraction. [To Cosmo.] Oh! false pretender to the Name of Justice! Why? for my Crime wilt thou destroy thy Son? Oh! Strike, Strike me, ye Ministers of Fate, Transfix my Heart! or rack me a whole Age, But save the best of Men, by me, by me undone! [Turning to the Hangmen, &amp;c. But if in spight of Nature, and of Reason, Turning to Cosmo.] Julio must die! Oh! kill me first in Mercy, Nor rack me e'er I perish with his Death! Oh! Julio! Julio! [Turning to Julio, and leaning on his Arm. Jul. Oh! Teraminta! this is worse than Death! Honor. Yet hold thy bloody Hand Tyrannic Cosmo, And I'll forgive thee for my lost Lorenzo. Grant me my Julio, Oh! in Death I ask thee, Thou hast already broke Honoria's Heart, Yet I will pardon that if Julio live. Ah! cruel Judge! Ah pityless Avenger! What art thou Whispering? Speak out the Horror, For in thy Glowing Eyes I read a Murder. Cos. I charge thee by thy Oath Uberto, As thou art here deputed by high Heaven, And not a Subject of a Woman's Folly, Take him away, and drag him to the Ax. Uber. It shall be thus then, not the Hangman's Hands. [Runs him through, the Women Shriek, Honoria Swoons. Jul. Thou'st kept thy Word, my Friend, And with my latest Breath I give thee thanks. Cos. Take hence this Woman; haste, and bear her home; Why my Uberto didst thou rob my Justice? Jul. I wrought him to it, Sir, that thus in Death I might have leave to pay my last Obedience, And beg your Blessing for another World. Ter. Oh! do not take it Julio! Whate'er comes From such a Monstrous Nature, must be blasting. Ah! thou inhumane Tyrant!—But alas! I loiter here when Julio waits for me, Look here my Love, thou shalt not be before me, [Stabs her self. Thus to thy Arms then,—Oh! make haste my Julio, I'm got already in the Grove of Death; Oh!—I grope about, but cannot find thee.— [Dies. Jul. I come thou matchless Virtue! Oh! my Heart! Farewel, my Love! we'll meet again in Heav'n: My Lord, I hope your Justice is atton'd. Cos. Thou hast so nobly born thy self in dying, That not to Bless thee were to Curse my self, Therefore I give thee thus my last Embrace. Print this last Kiss upon his trembling Lips.— So,—for I see thou'rt gone,—farewel for ever. Th'eternal Pow'rs, to whom such Virtue's dear, Reward, and Crown thee in another World. Jul. What Happiness has Life to equal this? By yon bright Orb I would not live again. To fall thus crown'd by Virtues fullest Wreaths, And die thus blest in such a Fathers Arms. Uber. He's gon, the Gallant Spirit's fled for ever. Cos. Captain no more.—Let us not soil the Pomp Of this Majestick Fate, with Woman's Wailings. But hear me O ye Florentines! What I have done to them, do you to me, When I like them shall dare offend my Country. All private Passions, and all ties of Blood, We ought to offer to the Publick Good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE: Wrote by Mr. Dennis, and spoken by Mr. Mills The following Piece by fiery Lee was wrought, And judg'd his strongest and his noblest Draught: In which He shew'd, pronouncing Tarquin's Doom, A Spirit Worthy Liberty and Rome. His Pegasus sometimes attains a daring Height, But often takes a wild ungovern'd Flight. And soaring up too high for Mortal Eyes, Is lost in Clouds, or lessens as He flies. T'was this that mov'd our Author, with Desire, To Temperate the Bards unruly Fire: His well-proportion'd Raptures He retains, But from his wild and frantick Starts refrains, And his false whining Passion he disdains. Poetick sacred Fire descends from High, And Fire is regulated in the Skie. Witness the Stars, that with their shining Force Are just, and constant to their rapid Course. Witness the God of Poetry and Day, Who still exactly keeps his flaming Way; Starting from which the World He overturns And either freezes Human Kind, or burns. Our Characters and Lee's are still the same, Tho Brutus we have chang'd for Cosmo's Name; For Anti-Regal Principles we must Have else display'd; which would be now unjust. For where is Liberty more charming seen Than in the Reign of our Auspicious Queen? Who mildly governing their Temperate Plains, Her Happy Subjects but from Harm restrains, And like strong Reason o'er the Passions reigns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE: Mr. Mills comes forward and makes an Apology for want of an Epilogue; then Mr. Penkethman enters dress'd like a Beaux, and says he has one by a Friend, Mr. Farquhar. Something you may expect—I'm dash'd—I doubt I ne'r, shall have the Face, to stand it out. Something you may expect, to raise delight Foolish enough at least, when Beaux do write. Tho here we stand, and look Wit evermore, We never ventur'd to talk Wit before Our outward parts, each Night, we here expose, But for our Inward, gad we nere shew those. We dont pretend to write, with Wit, nor Care; But only, as we Dance, we write, with Air; With careless sliding Stile; just like our Gate; But Gay, and Modish, Thoughtless, as our Pate; A soft and flowing Number, fit for Song, And that we write, just as we sing it, wrong. Prologues and Epilogues, we often make 'um, But then these Rogues, the Players, never speak 'um; We, that support their House! alack a day! We, make more Comedy, on the Stage, than they. What draws the Ladies pray? but such as we They bring not here, their lovely Eyes, to see Poor Julio slain, but to kill Beaux, like me: The Poets too, from us, draw all the Profit, Tho' not their Wit, we make, the Subject of it; But we, good-natur'd we, those things can smother, As we put up Affronts, from one another. I cou'd not for my Life, see this poor Rogue, Have this Play lost, for want of Epilogue. And therefore beg, you wou'd not damn it thus, The Ladys, can't refuse, when ask'd by us; You side-Box Beaux, I've orders, to engage From all us, Brother Beaux, here on the Stage. You, Sir, and I, and you, and he that writes, Were all resolv'd, to meet, anon at Whites, There, spight of Criticks Malice, save the Play; And make a Party, for the Poets day.</field>
