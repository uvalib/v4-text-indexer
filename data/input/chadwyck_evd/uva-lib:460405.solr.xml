Emira, Princess of Cambaya, disguised in man's apparel, under the name of Hydaspes, in love with Siroes. Laodice, in love with Siroes, Sister to Araxes.

      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Seleucia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A temple dedicated to the sun, with an altar and image of the Deity. Cosroes, Siroes, Medarses. Cos. To you my sons, not more am I a father Than father to the state: to you I owe Paternal tenderness; but to the state A successor, whom Persia shall confess A worthy heir of our imperial seat. This day, between you shall our choice decide; And him, I choose, must share with me the throne, And learn with me to guide the reins of empire. O! happy Cosroes, could I live to see, Ere lasting sleep has clos'd these aged eyes, A son who, wise in peace and brave in arms, Might shade the lustre of his father's fame. Med. On you my fate depends. Sir. And whom will Cosroes Esteem the worthiest? Cos. Equal is your merit; In Siroes I regard the gift of valour, And praise the gentler virtues of Medarses: Cosroes in thee dislikes thy haughty spirit; [to Sir. In him his inexperienc'd age; but time Will cure the faults of both: meanwhile I fear My choice proclaim'd may kindle in your bosoms New flames of mutual strife. Behold the altar, Behold the God: let each now swear in peace To abide by our decree, and swear to obey, Without a murmur, our appointed heir, In loyalty and truth. Sir. [aside.] Shall Siroes' lip Pronounce an oath like this?âO! no.â Med. Behold Medarses prompt to obeyâthe throne is mine, [aside. [advances to the altar.] âBefore thy presence, to whose fostering power âHer blessings nature owes, Medarses bends, âAnd swears to pay the new-elected king âHis earliest homage; if I fail in aught âThis oath exacts, O! let thy cheering beams âBe chang'd for me to more than midnight darkness.â Cos. My dearest son! Now, Siroes, thou draw near, And learn obedience from thy younger brother. Med. He thinks, but speaks not. Cos. Why dost thou delay To ensure my peace? How are thy thoughts employ'd? Sir. And wherefore should I swear? Such causeless doubt Offends your son? What are the merits, say, By which Medarses now aspires to reign? My father, well you know how far my claim To elder birth; already was my heart Inur'd to bear the wrongs of adverse fortune, When first a father in the cradle heard His infant cries: you know the hostile spoils By Siroes added to your former triumphs. You know the wounds your fame has cost a son, I groan'd beneath the steely corselet's weight, In fields of blood and in the face of death; While he in sloth dragg'd on his days, 'midst all A parent's fond endearment. This, my father, You know, and wherefore then must Siroes swear? Cos. I know yet moreâI know, in my despite, Thou lov'dst Emira, daughter to Asbites, My deadly foe: I heard thy sighs of anguish The day I took from him his life and kingdom: Then didst thou vow deep hatred to thy father; And were Emira living still, who knows To what, by love impell'd, thy rage might tend. Sir. Proceed: indulge at full the blind affection That makes you, Cosroes, thus unjust to me. Break, for Medarses, all the ties of nature, And let him from the throne give Persia laws; While Siroes, mingled with the ignoble herd, Shall on his younger brother's hand (a hand Unfit to wield the sceptre of dominion) Imprint the kiss of base servility. But Gods there are, whose justice ever wakes To aid the oppress'd: the world confess Medarses To Siroes yields in merit as in years. Cos. Rash boy! and dost thou threaten? Know, my will.â Med. Be calm, my father! and to him resign The Persian throne, suffice for me your love. Cos. No: for his punishment, this day shall see The audacious rebel bend to thee his king: I will subdue his pride; and fain would see What world will arm to raise him to the throne. [to Sir.] Since, swell'd with pride, thy stubborn heart, Paternal love disdains, Expect to find that sterner part The judge severe maintains. Whate'er a rebel bosom knows, Perchance in thine may dwell: But ere mature the treason grows, I'll crush it in the shell. [Exit. SCENE II. Siroes, Medarses. Sir. Canst thou, Medarses, fix without a blush Thine eyes on Siroes? Med. Ha! Does Siroes thus Address his king? Thou know'st that I this day To thee am arbiter of life and death: Think then how life to merit as my gift. Sir. Thou art too hasty, prince, to assume the stile That fits a monarch: the paternal crown Infolds not yet thy brows; and ere the day Declines, our father may repent his purpose. SCENE III. Enter Emira in a man's habit, under the name of Hydaspes. Em. Ah! princes, wherefore this unhappy strife? Forbear such contest as so ill beseems The name of brethren. On this joyful day Let not Seleucia view you hateful rivals, But knit by equal ties of love and honour. Med. I strive to appease my brother's causeless anger, And bear my wrongs in silence, but in vain. Sir. O! well feign'd modesty! Em. [to Sir.] I'm not to learn The meekness of Medarses. Sir. Dear Hydaspes, It ever was his wont to veil his insults With dark dissimulation. Med. [to Em.] Mark, my friend, His flushing face, his eyes' malignant glances, That speak the hatred rankling in his heart. Em. [to Med.] Depart, incense him not; leave me alone In converse with him. Sir. O! perfidious. Med. Heavens! Without a cause you now insult your brother. Appease him, dear Hydaspes; say, in him I venerate our Persia's great support, And own, in Siroes now my sovereign lord. Em. Go, leave us then. Med. [aside.] My triumph is at hand. [Exit Medarses. SCENE IV. Emira, Siroes. Sir. O! lovely and belov'd Emira. Em. Hold. Reveal me not, but call me still Hydaspes. Sir. No ear is nigh, and you are known, Emira, To me alone: behold the wrongs I suffer From an unfeeling father. Em. Yes, I've seen, And seen it long: but what does Siroes do? He rests meanwhile in stupid apathy, The lethargy of mean degenerate souls; And while a kingdom moulders from his hope, He, like a child, a helpless infant, finds No other arms to oppose his cruel fortune, But fruitless sighs and idle lamentation. Sir. And what could Siroes do? Em. What could he do? What could he not? For him his faithful people With loyal fury burn: a single blow Secures thy triumph, and at once completes My vengeance and thy own. Sir. Alas! Emira, What would'st thou ask? Em. I ask a single blow, Needful to bothâand know'st thou who I am? Sir. Ah! well I know thee for my soul's best treasure, Cambaya's princessâyes, thou art Emira. Em. Say, I am she, whose sire Asbites died By Cosroes' cruel hand; that hapless daughter, Who stript of empire, in a foreign clime, Now wanders far from her paternal seat; Who veils, in this attire, her woman's weakness, And hopes at length to reap a great revenge. Sir. O Heaven! by me receiv'd within the palace, You found the means to win the heart of Cosroes: His favour all is yours; and can you now, Forgetful of his benefits conferr'd, Still brood in secret o'er revenge and hatred. Em. The tyrant loves Hydaspes not Emira. Remember, if you wish Emira's hand, I wish for Cosroes' death. Sir. And could Emira Receive me stain'd with blood, this face distorted With all the horrors of a father's murder? Em. And how can I, forgetful of my oath, Behold a parent's pale and bleeding shade Still hover round and call on me for vengeance; While careless, stretch'd upon my downy pillow, I sleep beside the son of him that slew him? Sir. If thenâ Em. If then thou wouldst receive my hand, Thou know'st what service can alone deserve it: Thou must assist my vengeance. Sir. Never! never! Em. Hear, if thou, Siroes, still refuse thine arm, Another's is not wanting: yes, this day Completes the work; and he whose courage aids Emira's cause, Emira's love rewards: Thus, should thy coward hand refuse the stroke, Thou losest me, and canst not save thy father. Sir. Are these, Emira, these the tender feelings With which you once were wont to sooth my anguish? 'Twas hatred led you hither, while to me You feign'd your guide was love. Em. I kept from thee My hatred hid, while Cosroes was a father; But now he sinks the father in the tyrant, No longer deem in thee to find a son. Sir. And would'st thou have me then a parricide? And does the crime of loving thee deserve A punishment so dreadful? Em. Now full well I read thy heart: thou never lov'dst Emira. Sir. I never lov'd! Em. Behold Laodice, She, who enjoys thy love, she best confirms it. Sir. Laodice! I but endur'd her passion With faint repulse, to sooth, by harmless guile In her, whom Cosroes loves, a powerful foe. SCENE V. Enter Laodice. Em. At length thou com'st in time, Laodice, To ease a faithful lover, who so oft With tender sighs has languish'd in thy absence. Laod. Hydaspes speaks, and ah! my easy heart Too soon believes. Em. The rest let Siroes speak. Sir. [aside.] Unfeeling maid to torture thus my bosom! Laod. [to Sir.] And can I think, illustrious prince, your heart Will so debase itself in loving me? Em. [to Laod.] His love is firmly yours. Sir. [aside to Em.] Hers, say'st thou, hers? Em. [to him.] Peace, perjur'd man. Laod. Does love so little then Give utterance to his lips? Em. A faithful lover Whose bosom burns, still feeds the flame in silence. Laod. Yet oft the glances of an eye betray The silent lip: but not a look from him Is turn'd on me; nay rather, as confus'd, He bends his eyes to earth in stupid gaze, And seems to give thy every word the lie. Em. Not so, Laodice, you are deceiv'd; You know not Siroes: but I know him well; He stands abash'd in presence of Hydaspes. Sir. [to Em.] Alas, my love! far other dost thou know. Em. [to him.] Traitor, no more. Laod. Abash'd before Hydaspes? Thou know'st he has no fault, or if a fault, 'Tis courage in extreme, not timid shame. Em. But love, that changes all, can render valiant The coward heart, and fearful make the bold. Sir. [aside.] Unfeeling maid! to torture thus my bosom. Em. 'Twere best to leave you: constant lovers ever, Who love like you, abhor society. Laod. Hydaspes, yet I tremble lest he still Deceive thee and myself. Em. I dare not wholly Condemn your doubts; for well by proof I know, In trusting others never does the mind Exert the caution confidence requires; We seldom find fidelity in love. The faith of every lover still, How dangerous to believe; Their sighs, their prayers, their tears at will The easy heart deceive. Shall man, by self reproach unblam'd, The fair, he wrong'd, survey; As if the crime were venial nam'd, Affection to betray? [Exit. SCENE VI. Siroes, Laodice. Laod. You speak not, Siroesâwhat is now your fear? Hydaspes is not present: freely then Disclose your secret. Sir. [aside.] Why am I pursued With love so fatal?âAh! Laodice, Subdue a passion that endangers both, Should Cosroes, who adores thee, ever learnâ Laod. O! fear not him, he never will discover Our gentle intercourse. Sir. But then, Hydaspesâ Laod. Hydaspes is a friend; and, Siroes, he Approves our love. Sir. Not always do the lips And heart agree. Laod. We but torment ourselves With fancied ills; if obstacles like these Must from our breast expunge such dear affection. Sir. Others there areâLaodice, farewell. Laod. Yet stayâand why conceal them? Sir. Heavenly powers! Spare me the shame of speech, and spare thyself The pain to hear them. Laod. Will you leave me then Thus lost in cruel doubts? Speak, prince, Ah! speak. Sir. [aside.] O pain to suffer!âhear me then declare, Ah! noâforgive meâI must leave thee. Laod. Never, Till you have given me first to know your secret. Sir. Some other time shall tell thee all. Laod. But now, Now is the eventful moment. Sir. Hear me then, Since thou wilt know, I burn with other flames; My faith is plighted to a lovelier object; The fairest of her sex: I love not thee, Nor ever yet have lov'd, and should thy hopes Aspire to change my heart, such hopes are vain: Distract me notâmy secret now is known, If e'er these lips could love declare, These eyes soft glances dart; These treacherous lips must falsely swear, These eyes belie my heart. Then seek some other breast to move, All thoughts of me forsake; And for thy recompense in love, This friendly council take. [Exit. SCENE VII. Laodice alone. And shall I then endure such cruel scorn? Oh! no, Laodice; affront like this Must be reveng'd. Shall that ungrateful boast His triumph in my shame? A thousand foes Will, at my bidding, rise at once against him. It shall be soâhis father must believe The son his rival, both in love and empire; And by my arts impell'd, shall now my brother Araxes, offer to Medarses' aid The troops in arms; and if I meet not all My wish, at least I will not sigh alone. SCENE VIII. Enter Araxes. Arax. My sister, with impatience have I sought thee. Laod. And now most opportune for me, we meet. Ar. Thy help was ne'er more needful. Laod. Nor have I So wish'd thy converse: know my brotherâ Ar. Hold: First hear me, sister: fir'd with hasty passion, Cosroes will raise Medarses to the throne: Orders are issued for the solemn pomp; The people vent complaints; the soldiers murmur. Thou, if thou canst, appease an angry father, Incens'd unjustly, and in Siroes save A hero to the land. Laod. A hero?âNo, Thou art deceiv'd; for in the breast of Siroes Resides a soul most obstinately savage; A heart o'erflow'd with pride: he seems to prize Himself alone, and thinks the subject world Must all pay tribute to his matchless valour. Ar. Is this my sister speaks? And dost thou thinkâ Laod. I think his ruin is by us, Araxes, Most firmly to be wish'd: his fall is near, Prevent not thou his fate. Ar. And who has thus Estrang'd Laodice? Laod. 'Tis not for thee To fathom yet my secret. Ar. Every one Will blame your fickle and inconstant nature. Laod. â'Tis often constancy to change the mind.â If ocean gently lave the shore, And now in storms, with deepening roar The mariner dismays; No fault is his, who but the power Of stronger winds obeys. If I with changing fortune veer, Yet let me not be blam'd; What once inconstant might appear May now be virtue nam'd. [Exit. SCENE IX. Araxes alone. I shall not for Laodice betray My friendship or my duty.âWho can tell The secret cause from which her anger springs? Such is the genius of the weaker sex: O! woman, beauteous woman! how might man Indulge his rapture in your love bestow'd, If constancy were join'd with female charms. The uncertain stream that murmuring flows Between its banks, the wind that blows, Oft shifting through the rustling boughs, Are steadier far than you. Yet simple lovers still prepare New food to nourish amorous care; With tears and sighs pursue the fair, And hope to find her true. [Exit. SCENE X. An inner apartment belonging to Cosroes. A table with seats. Siroes with a paper. Still let me from Emira's snares preserve My father's life.âThis paper, thus impress'd With characters disguis'd, describes the danger, But keeps unknown the traitor.âIf my silence Conceal the first, I must betray my father; And if I tell the last, I sacrifice My cruel, lov'd EmiraâHa! the king Seems this way bendingâWhither shall I turn? Should he perceive me here he'll sure suspect From me the warning comes, and force me then To name the guilty: best awhile retire And hide me from his sightâO Gods! defend, Defend Emira, guard my father's life, And ah! protect my innocence. [retires. SCENE XI. Enter Cosroes. Cos. Shall then The heart of Cosroes from a rebel son Receive its laws? 'Twere madness but to think it. SCENE XII. Enter Laodice. Cos. What brings my fair-one unexpected here? Laod. I come to claim protection.âCosroes' favour Suffices not, even in these palace walls, To shelter me from fear; nor those are wanting That outrage and insult me. Cos. Who can dare So far presume? Laod. My crime, alas! is truth And loyalty to you. Cos. Declare the guilty, And leave with me the care to punish him. Laod. Your son attempted to seduce my love, And when I durst reject his impious suit, He menac'd me with death. Sir. [listening.] What do I hear? Cos. My lov'd Medarses could not thus offend: NoâSiroes is the criminal. Laod. 'Tis true. What can a woman, helpless, unprotected, Against the royal heir of Persia's king? Sir. [apart.] All, all the world conspire against my peace! Cos. And shall he prove my rival too in love? Dry up those tears, O! lovely mourner, calm Thy troubled thoughts.âO! most ungrateful Siroes! And hast thou dar'd? Believe not I am Cosroes If I forgetâenoughâLaodice, Yes, thou shalt seeâ Sir. [apart.] O! pain to think! Laod. [aside.] 'Twas wise In me to accuse him first. Cos. [sits at the table.] Unworthy son! [sees the paper left by Sir. and reads to himself. Laod. Had I foreseen such anguish to your heart I never thenâ[aside.] What paper's that? He reads Absorb'd and lostâhe changes colour! Cos. Gods! What worse could angry Heaven have rais'd against me! Was ever day like this? [rises. Laod. My gracious lord, What now afflicts you? SCENE XIII. Enter Medarses. Med. Father, I behold Your features chang'd. Cos. [gives him the paper.] Read there, belov'd Medarses, And tremble as thou read'st. Laod. [aside.] What can this mean? Med. [reads.] âCosroes, a snare is laid to take thy life, âBy one believ'd most loyal: on this day âThe blow is meant. Suspect in every one âThe secret traitor: death is surely thine, âIf from thy presence thou remov'st not all âThat share thy best affectionsâhe who gives âThis counsel is thy friend: believe and live.â [he returns the paper to Cos. Laod. I freeze with horror! Cos. What inhuman pity Thus, thus to save me! From a hand unknown The warning comes, but points not out the guilty. Then must I ever fear my friends, my sons? In every cup believe my death conceal'd, And see the cruel threat in every sword? Is this to be preserv'd? Is this to live? Sir. [apart.] Unhappy father! Med. [aside.] Lose not now, my soul, This fair occasion. Cos. Still, Medarses, silent? Laodice, thou dost not speak. Laod. Alas! I'm struck with terror. Med. If I spoke not yet, I wish'd to hide the guilty from your anger, The guilty dear to both; but when I see The cruel anguish of a father's heart, I can no longer holdâthat paper's mine. Sir. [apart.] Insidious falsehood! Cos. Know'st thou then the traitor, And yet conceal'st him from my just resentment? Med. [kneels.] O father most belov'd! forgive the guilty; Let it suffice, thy life has been preserv'd: Ah! think not ever in such blood to stain Your royal hands: know, he who seeks your life Is your own sonâand your Medarses' brother! Sir. [apart.] Must I be silent still? Cos. Medarses, rise: What tongue to thee reveal'd the dreadful secret? Med. Siroes himself disclos'd it. Laod. [aside.] Can it be! What heart would have conceiv'd it? Med. Long he tried To make me partner in his crimeâI pleaded, I begg'd, but all in vain, he vow'd your death; And hence Medarses in that scroll reveal'd The dire design. Sir. [discovers himself.] Medarses is a traitor: That paper's mine. Med. [aside.] O Heaven! Laod. [aside.] What do I see? Cos. Ha! Siroes here, conceal'd in my apartment! Med. His guilt is clear. Sir. 'Tis false: desire to save Your threaten'd life, my father, brought me hither: A desperate foe, unknown, designs your death, And you're betray'd. SCENE XIV. Enter Emira. Em. [entering.] And who betrays my king? In his defence behold this arm and sword. Sir. There wanted but Hydaspes to complete The wretchedness of Siroes. Cos. [to Em.] See, my friend, To what has Heaven reserv'd me. [gives the paper. Laod. Strange events! Em. [having read the paper returns it.] Whence came this warning? Is the traitor known? Med. Medarses has reveal'd the whole. Sir. My brother Deceives thee, good Hydaspes, know 'twas I Disclos'd the secret. Cos. Wherefore then forbear To name the assassin? Sir. Thus far have I spoke, But dare not utter further. Em. O! perfidious! And would'st thou thus conceal thy impious treason With virtue's thin disguise? A friend to none, The offender nor the offended; both betray'd. The monarch is not safe; the stroke design'd By thee prevented; now thou com'st to boast The warning given in that ambiguous paper. Yes, traitor, I would fainâ[to Cos.] forgive, my king, This warmth of temper: 'tis my duty speaks: As loyalty has bound me to the father, So far respect is wanting to the son: Your danger is my own. Laod. [aside.] What noble daring! Cos. What do I owe to thee, belov'd Hydaspes? [to Sir.] Learn, learn, ingrate, behold a stranger born; The blood of Cosroes circles in thy veins: To him I gave my favour, thee thy life, And yet behold he stands to guard my safety, While thy insidious arts invade my throne. Sir. I dare no further plead in my defence, And yet I am not guilty. Med. Innocence Is ever bold, nor keeps a sullen silence; Medarses freely speaks. Em. [to Sir.] Away: what now Employs thy thoughts? What dost thou? He who goes So far, would doubtless soon complete his purpose; Thou answer'st not: I know thou art confus'd; It galls thee now to find thy heart reveal'd, And all thy falsehood open'd to Hydaspes; And hence thy silence, hence thy looks of shame, And hence that fear to cast thine eyes on mine. Sir. [aside.] There wanted but Hydaspes to complete The wretchedness of Siroes. Cos. Yes, Medarses, His silence justifies the imputed guilt. Med. Medarses truly spoke. Em. But Siroes' lips Are fraught with falsehood. Sir. 'Tis too much, Hydaspes, And shall not this suffice? What would'st thou more? Em. Do thou from anxious doubts relieve my king. Sir. What can I say? Em. Say? That thy crime is mine, Say that, with thee, I'm partner in the guilt; Or rather say that all the guilt is mine, And thine the loyalty: for this, and more A mind like his might feign. [to Cosroes. Cos. But fruitless all. 'Tis not an easy task to impose on Cosroes: I know thy truth too well. [to Em. Em. O! would to heaven That Siroes' loyal faith could equal mine! Cos. I know him tooâall, all proclaims him traitor; He neither makes defence, nor sues for pardon. Sir. I can no further plead my hapless cause, And yet I'm innocent. Med. Is he not guilty, Who could refuse but now a solemn oath To calm a father's peace? Laod. Is he not guilty, Who cherish'd in his breast presumptuous love? Cos. Is he not guilty, whom myself I found Conceal'd in secret here? Em. Is he not guilty, Who first could claim this paper as his own, And when I press'd him close with words of truth, Stood mute and terrified? Sir. All, all conspire To fix my guilt, and yet I'm innocent. What foes like these, alas! combin'd, Could ruthless Fortune send? To judge me and condemn I find A cruel fair and brother join'd, A father and a friend. I see all present help is vain, All hope from future time; Yet that I still my truth retain, Is made my only crime. [Exit. SCENE XV. Cosroes, Emira, Medarses, Laodice. Cos. Ho!âlet the prince be watch'd. [to the guards without. Em. Myself will keep Your royal person safe. Med. Why fears my father, Enclos'd with faithful friends, a single traitor? Laod. You are too deeply mov'd. Cos. And who can tell What friend is true; or know what snare is laid? Em. You fear not me, my lord. Cos. No, dear Hydaspes, On thy untainted faith I trust my all: Search deep this treason, and defend in Cosroes A prince that loves thee. Em. Nor can Cosroes trust His peace to one, who bears a heart more loyal: If all his aid, his counsel nought avail, Hydaspes, jealous of his truth and honour, Will shed his dearest blood in your defence. Cos. Thus while I lose a son, I find a friend. Fate hovers, like a rushing tide, That from the cliff descends; But thou, dear youth, shalt turn aside The ruin that impends. Near and more near the dangers threat, And, doubtful where to fly, If e'er thy faith a king forget, On whom shall he rely? [Exit. SCENE XVI. Emira, Medarses, Laodice. Med. Who would have thought in Siroes e'er to find A traitor to his king? Laod. Or who conceiv'd A heart so treacherous and a love so daring? Em. And what can urge these mean unworthy insults On one who hears them not? Medarses surely Might own some feeling to a brother's name; And you, Laodice, with more respect Might judge a prince like him: believe not always The unhappy are the guilty. Med. Does Medarses Such pity feel for Siroes? Laod. Thou to plead In his behalf? Med. And didst not thou, Hydaspes, Till now insult him? Load. Say, what cause excites Thy anger against us? Em. From me perchance He might deserve reproach, but not from you. Med. So soon to change, and now defend the man Whom late you sought to ruin? Em. You believe Hydaspes chang'd, Hydaspes is the same. Laod. The same? I know not what your speech intends. Med. A mind unchang'd could never dictate words, That speak the thoughts so various. Em. Be it so: Believe it mystery, but believe it true. Have you beheld the summer rain With kindly showers refresh the plain; Where, near the purple violet, blows With tints renew'd the blushing rose? Both flowers one soil maternal breeds, And both one genial moisture feeds. My heart is one, though now I seem To absolve the prince and now condemn. One cause impels me, while by turns My pity melts, my anger burns. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Laodice, Medarses. Laod. The words Hydaspes utter'd sure contain Some strange and hidden sense. Med. Ah! little read In human kind; and dost thou then believe him? Thou shouldst be vers'd in courts: 'tis ever thus With him who holds the favour of his prince: His artificial plots are hidden secrets: The less the vulgar comprehend, the more They worship and admire. Laod. I cannot think Hydaspes' meaning such: 'tis true I know not To what it tends, but whilst I hear him speak, Like him I change my purpose and my thoughts, And know not what I hope, or what I fear. No certain fears my bosom fill, Nor know I hope sincere; And yet in hope I wander still, And wander still in fear. I know not why, but stript of rest, All peace is banish'd from my breast. [Exit. SCENE XVIII. Medarses alone. Great are my aims: and thus far well advanc'd My project shows. The recompense at hand, Amidst such tumults still I stand unshaken: He never trusts the sea who fears a storm. Amidst the storm, while fearful night Has hid the stars from human sight, Across the gloom a ray of light Already fortune shows. This labour o'er, my care shall cease, My troubled soul return to peace, And thoughts of dangers past increase The sweets of calm repose. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A royal park. Laodice alone. How fatal is the pleasure of revenge! Revenge, that follow'd, ends in deep repentance. This I too well have prov'd; for Siroes' danger My breast is torn with horror and remorse. SCENE II. Enter Siroes. Sir. At length, Laodice, you are reveng'd And Siroes suffers for a fault of yours. Laod. Ah! prince belov'd! such anguish rends my bosom, I dare not speak. Sir. And yet, Laodice, You fear'd not to accuse me. Laod. Blind resentment For your disdain impell'd a jealous woman To such detested falsehood: O! forgive, Forgive the madness of a love like mine, And let my grief suffice for punishment: I will disclose the whole, and Cosroes now Shall know 'twas Iâ Sir. Your ruin, that would follow, Cannot ensure my safety: were I clear'd Of love to you, a crime of deeper dye Is charg'd upon me. Cease, Laodice, Thy pity may awaken new suspicions Of our imputed loves. Laod. What shall I do To merit your forgiveness? Tell me, Siroes, Behold me ready now to atone my guilt. Sir. I blot it from my mind, and if you think That such oblivion merits some return, Henceforth forget to love me. Laod. O! ye powers! How can I cease to cherish love like mine? In silent anguish will I mourn The fate I'm doom'd to prove; But hope not that this breast forlorn Can ever cease to love. Ah! cruel, what offence if I Within my heart retain, The wretched privilege to sigh, And sigh, alas! in vain? [Exit. Sir. O! that my words could calm Emira's anger, As now they have appeas'd Laodice. [going. Enter Emira. Em. Stay, faithless man! Sir. And cannot yet my sufferings Suffice thy cruelty? Em. And art thou yet Contented to betray me? Sir. Now perchance Thou com'st again with cruel taunts to insult A wretched guiltless prince. Em. And thou perchance, Now seek'st thy father to reveal the secret That paper had with-held. Sir. At least the paper Offends not thee: the guilt is fix'd on Siroes: I groan beneath the charge, and yet am silent. Em. And I, what did I, when I seem'd to insult And most reproach thee? Firmly I secur'd The confidence of Cosroes in my faith, More for thy safety, than for my revenge. Sir. Ah! then, my love, do more for Siroes' sake; Forgive his father; or at least, if still You seek revenge, then seek it in this bosom. Em. I cannot so confound the son and father: Cosroes I hate, but thee Emira loves; I wish but to revenge a parent slain. Sir. And I, by nature's law, defend my own; And justice higher sanctifies the duty To guard the living than revenge the dead. Em. Go thenâpursue thy nobler enterprise, And leave to me my own: but knowst thou well What both our duties claim? In us, the children Of foes profess'd, our passion is a crime. No, we should hate each other: duty bids thee Reveal my purpose to the ear of Cosroes; And duty bids me to prevent discovery. Thou in Emira should'st behold a foe, Cruel, implacable; in Siroes I Detest the unworthy offspring of a tyrant: Then henceforth let us both be deadly foes. [going. Sir. Stay, stay, my life! Em. And call'st thou me thy life? Would'st thou unite the lover with the foe? At once thou but betray'st, what nature made thee, A faithless lover and a feeble foe. Sir. You wrong me much, my love,â Em. Be silentâlove Is lost in hatredâspeak to me of rage, Of vengeance speak, and I with pleasure hear thee. Sir. And must I thenâ Em. O! yes, forget Emira. Sir. Farewell, Emira, thou wilt have me guilty, Wilt have me deadâthou shalt be satisfied. I'll to my father and avow his son The secret traitorâthus thy cruelty Shall be at full appeas'd. [going. Em. Holdâgo not yet. Sir. What wouldst thou have? Leave, leave me to my fate. Em. Yet hearâto make thee guilty nought avails To me or Cosroes. Sir. 'Tis enough for me To perish innocent: hear me, Emira, At length I find I'm more a son than lover; I can no longer live, and still be silent: If nothing less can save him from thy fury, I will disclose the whole. Em. Go, traitor, go, Accuse thyself or me. In spite of thee Thy purpose I'll prevent: then see who most Will gain belief. [going. Sir. I see, too cruel maid! My blood is sought and I will shed the stream, Now sate thy cruel heart with Siroes' death. [draws his sword. SCENE III. Enter Cosroes. Cos. [entering sees the sword drawn.] What dost thou, impious youth? Em. [aside.] O! heavenly Powers! Cos. Wretch! hast thou drawn thy sword against my friend? Can'st thou refute this truth? Tho' none beside Accuses thee, mine eyes are not deceiv'd; Say that I charge thee falsely. Sir. All is true: Yes, I am guilty; I betray my father; I hate my brother, and insult Hydaspes. Death, death is my desert: you are unjust, If longer you delay the welcome stroke. I heed nor Gods nor men, detest myself, And loath the light of Heaven. Em. [aside.] Ye Powers! defend him. Cos. Ho! guards! secure the prince. [guards enter. Em. He meant not, sir, Offence to me, but blind with sudden passion, Perchance against himself design'd the weapon. Cos. In vain thou seek'st to veil his crime with arts Of pious falsehood. Wherefore didst thou fly? Em. My flight was not from fear. Sir. O! cease, no more: Hydaspes, cease: my greatest foe is he Who now would save me; death, and death alone Must end my present torment. Cos. Take thy wish? Thou hast few moments, traitor, more to live. Em. What says my king? On Siroes' life prolong'd Depends your own: he has not yet confess'd The accomplice of his crime: with him would die The important secret. Cos. True. How much, Hydaspes, I owe thy love: be ever near me still. Sir. So may you run perhaps on certain fate: Who knows but that Hydaspes may betray you? Em. Who, I betray him! Sir. Every one may prove A foe conceal'd; take heed nor trust appearance: Who can discern the traitor? Cos. Peace and leave me. Sir. You think me faithless; hence alone The secret pangs I feel: What tongue can make the traitor knownâ [aside.] O! torture to conceal. A father, hence your son you send, And send with doom severe: Yet think what dangers now impend, And O! to few your trust extend; But learn in time to fear. [Exit guarded. SCENE IV. Cosroes, Emira. Em. [aside.] The king is thoughtful. Cos. [to himself.] From such numerous proofs I know my son is guiltyâyet those wordsâ Em. [aside.] Perhaps his mind begins to admit suspicions Suggested thus by Siroes. Cos. [to himself.] Can it be! Hydaspes to betray me? Em. If he once Suspect my truth, my purpose half is lost. He heeds me notâWe are aloneâthe time Now calls upon meâ Cos. He perhaps that's guilty Accuses him to make his crime the less, By partnership of treason. Em. Now, Emira, [draws her sword. Now slay the victim to thy father's ghost. SCENE V. Enter Medarses. Med. My lord. Em. [aside.] O! heavenly powers! Med. Hydaspes, say What means that weapon? Em. At his foot to lay The pledge of loyalty: there are who durst Excite his fear of me. My jealous honour Admits not doubtâHydaspes deem'd a traitor! Yes, Siroes here has touched meâMighty Gods! Has touch'd my inmost heart, and till this truth Be deeply search'd, behold me now disarm'd And Cosroes' prisoner. Cos. O! exalted faith! Med. Perchance my brother sought another name To veil his crime. Cos. Hydaspes, to its place Return thy sword, to wear in my defence. Em. Forgive me, when a monarch's life's in danger A shadow is a substance; from your mind Be banish'd first the doubt that wrongs Hydaspes, Then to its place return the unsullied weapon, Fit guardian for your safety. Cos. No, Hydaspes, Resume thy sword. Em. I must not, Sir, obey you. Cos. 'Tis my command. Em. What you command, Hydaspes No longer dares oppose. But yet permit me To leave the court, lest new suspicions, rais'd By envious minds, should taint my innocence. Cos. No; 'tis my will Hydaspes should remain To watch my danger. Em. I? Cos. Yes, thou Hydaspes. Em. Who can to me unsure the faith of numbers To whom your life is trusted? I must stand Pledg'd for the truth of eachâHad I myself The sole disposalâ Cos. 'Tis enoughâin thee That power be vested: from the royal guards Take those approv'd the trustiest: at thy will, Dispose and change them; and the care be thine To find the latent traitor. Em. I obey The royal will, and trust no lurking treason Will long be hidden from my searching eyes. [aside.] My vessel now has nearly reach'd the port. From every fear your mind release, Compose your beating heart to peace; For you my cares shall never cease: Still think me just and true. That moment I forget to obey The duties claim'd by sovereign sway, And wrong my king, may Heaven repay The wrong with vengeance due. [Exit. SCENE VI. Cosroes, Medarses. Med. 'Tis wondrous, sure, to find such loyalty In one a stranger born; but yet, my king, All this suffices not: our destiny Demands a stronger pledge. Cos. Before this day Declines, thou shalt be partner in my throne: Then little can one madman's pride prevail Against the power of two united kings. Med. Your love to me will but incense him more: Already Siroes has seduc'd the people, And numbers own his cause: seditious threats Are heard on every hand.âAlas! my lord, Unless the plant is rooted from the soil, It still must grow and spread to our annoyance. A remedy is sureâbut harsh to speakâ The head once sever'd, faction in the vulgar Soon loses all its vigour. Cos. Oh! my heart Recoils from such a deedâ Med. 'Tis true, the thought Congeals my blood.âNo other way remains To ensure your safety, but to pardon Siroes, And raise him to the throne.âTo him, my father, I gladly yield the now contested sway, To wander far an exile from my country, And ease his fears of me: should this be little, My vital blood shall gladly flow to appease him: Strike here, and deem me happy in the wound That renders peace to him who gave me being. Cos. I feel my eyes o'erflow with tenderness: Ah! dear Medarses, let me hold thee thus, Close to my heart. Why did not Heaven bestow Two sons like thee! Med. Alas! could I refuse My worthless life to buy your future safety, I were indeed unworthy such a father. From you the light of Heaven I drew, And now I stand prepar'd for you My life or death to find. My life, if living I can cure The anxious pangs you now endure, Or death, if dying I ensure Your future peace of mind. [Exit. SCENE VII. Cosroes alone. No, Cosroes, noâthou canst no longer doubt, And Siroes is the traitor.âJustice now Should sentence guilt; but O! I cannot fix My weak resolves; and midst my deep resentment A remnant of paternal kindness Here lingers in my breast and pleads his cause. With anger and with love oppress'd, Those tyrants of the human breast, What foes my peace assail! While jealousy would guard the throne, While pity would preserve the son, All hopes from counsel fail. This way and that my soul to bend, The father and the king contend, While neither can prevail. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Apartments, with a view of the royal gardens. Siroes disarmed. Araxes. Ar. He who refuses succour justifies The rigour of his fate: despair, my prince, Not virtue makes you thus condemn in me A zeal that has improv'd the people's favour In your behalf. Sir. The stroke of adverse Fate Is conquer'd by endurance. Ar. Seldom Fortune Is friend to merit; and she takes offence That ever man should more confide in virtue Than in her partial favours. Sir. Know, the soul That warms this bosom would far rather bear The pangs of suffering innocence than find Such happiness as follows prosperous guilt. Ar. That innocence is little priz'd which meets The world's reproach.âThe vulgar from events Direct their judgment, and believe those guilty Whom Fortune has depress'd. Sir. Enough for me To know myself and die with self-applause. Ar. Still in despite of this too rigid virtue, The care be mine to save you from your father, Unjust and cruel Cosroes: yes, the people, The squadrons will unite in such a cause. Sir. But this is surely treason, not defence. Ar. Since you, though innocent, would lose That aid a friend supplies: To meet the conflict you refuse, My valour shall suffice; And few the treason will accuse By which a traitor dies. [Exit. SCENE IX. Siroes, Medarses. Med. Alone, my brother? Sir. I have ever with me The sad society of adverse Fortune. Med. Thy happiness is surely now secur'd. This instant Cosroes will be here: perchance He comes to give thee comfort. Sir. See what comfort My destiny has sent: instead of Cosroes Medarses comes. Med. Yes, doubtless 'tis thy wish Without a witness to receive thy father: So might'st thou practise every soothing art To varnish o'er thy guilt; but could thy folly E'er hope Medarses would consent to this? Sir. Thou art deceiv'd: as gladly would I speak When thou art present: he who knows not guilt Ne'er feels the glow of shame.âIn seeing thee, It only grieves me to reflect our blood Flow'd from one common spring. Med. I ask no virtues But royalty and empire. SCENE X. Enter Cosroes and Emira. Cos. [entering.] Guard, Hydaspes, The entrance here, and let Laodice Be near to wait my bidding. Em. I obey. [retires apart. Cos. Medarses, leave us. Med. Must I leave you, sir? And should I be accus'd, what friend will then Defend my innocence? Cos. I will defend it. Sir. [to Med.] Remain, if so thou wilt. Cos. [to Sir.] No, I would first Converse with thee alone. Med. And can you, sir, Intrust yourself with him? Cos. Enquire no further: Leave us, Medarses. Med. I obey; but yetâ Cos. No more, Medarsesâgoâretire awhile. Med. [aside.] My cruel fortune now begins to frown. [Exit. SCENE XI. Cosroes, Siroes. Emira apart. Cos. Sit, Siroes, now, and listen while I speak. [sits. Behold I come a father or a judge, Even as thyself would'st choose me. If a father, Then mark how far my clemency extends; Or, if a judge, observe how well with thee I can support the duty. Sir. Siroes fears not The name of judge, and venerates the father. [sits. Cos. May I expect the obedience of a son To one command? Speak not till I have finish'dâ But hear me with respect. Sir. I promise, sir, Till you permit my speech, to attend in silence. Em. [hearing them.] What would he say? Cos. I see, thee, Siroes, guilty Of many crimes; but let me first recall them To thy remembrance. I from thee requir'd An oath that might secure the kingdom's peace, And this thou didst refuse. I pardon'd thee, And thou, ungrateful, didst abuse my mercy. A paper told me that some traitor lurk'd Amongst my dearest friends; and while my mind Was labouring with suspense and anxious terror, I found thee, then conceal'd in my apartment. What would I more? Medarses has himself Reveal'd thy crimesâ Sir. And can you, sir, believeâ Cos. Observe thy promise, hear me and be silent. Em. [to herself] Unhappy prince! Cos. All vent complaints against thee, Thou hast scoff'd at all decorum in the court; And from thy insolence is none secure. Medarses bears thy insults; and thy love Has rashly dar'd to affront Laodice, Nay offer threats; and even, before my eyes, Thou wouldst have slain Hydaspes. Add to these The people's murmurs rais'd against my peace, Excited first by theeâ Sir. Ah! falsehood all! Cos. Observe thy promise, hear me and be silent. Behold me now, provok'd by such excesses, As if compell'd to sentence thee; and yet I pardon all, and blot them from remembrance. Come then, my son, let us again revive The love of child and parent. Name the traitor, Or those that share his treason: from the offender An injur'd father claims no recompense But penitence sincere and future truth. Em. [to herself.] I see that Siroes now is greatly mov'd: Alas! should he betray meâ Sir. O! my lord, I cannot speak Cos. Then hear me,âDost thou fear For him that's guilty? Know thy fear is vain, If thou art he, confession to a father Absolves the crime and smooths thy path to empire; But if thou art not he, disclose his name And freely I forgive him. If thou wilt, Receive this royal hand, the pledge of pardon. Em. [aside.] Alas! I fear. Sir. O! could I surely know Your justice never would pursue the treason, I might revealâ Em. [interrupting them hastily.] Does not my lord remember That now Laodice awaits his leisure? Sir. [aside.] O! Heavens! what means she here? Cos. [to Em.] I know it well: Ietire Hydaspes. Em. I obey my sovereign. [aside to Sir.] Perfidious! dare not now betray my secret. [retires. Sir. [aside.] Cruel Emira! Cos. [to Sir.] Siroes, speak, retrieve My past affections.âStill, still art thou silent? Why art thou thus disturb'd? Sir. O! Heaven! Cos. I see Thou canst not bear to hear without emotion Laodice but nam'd. In this, my son, Thou shalt be happy: I will here prevent Thy warmest wishes; I confess my weakness; I love Laodice, (with shame I own it,) And yet to thee resign her: only speak, Disclose the hidden snare, secure my peace, And take her for thy bride. Sir. You would not, sir, Believe your sonâ Em. [interrupting them.] Laodice impatient Has press'd to be admitted; and in fear She might intrude upon your privacy, I have dismiss'd her hence. Cos. And is she gone? Em. She is, my king. Cos. Go, haste and call her back. Em. I go, my lordâThou wilt not sure betray me? [aside to Sir. Sir. [aside.] What anguish do I suffer? Cos. Speak, my son, Laodice is thineâWhat would'st thou more? I see thee still in doubt. Sir. I never lov'd Laodiceâand yet I must not speak. Cos. [rising.] Perfidious! now too plain I read thy purpose, To live a traitor and a traitor die. What could'st thou further ask? I seal thy pardon, Invite thee to my throne, and to thy arms Resign a maid, the object of my love; Yet all will not suffice. My death, my blood, I know thou long hast sought. Unworthy son! Indulge thy wish: behold me here before thee, Unguarded and aloneâInhuman! now, Disarm me now, and plunge the weapon here. [points to his breast. Em. [interposing.] What cause excites such anger in my king? I must not leave you thus without defence? Behold me here. Cos. Go, bring Laodice. [Exit Emira. SCENE XII. Cosroes, Siroes. Sir. My lord, if e'er I lov'd Loadice, May Heaven in justiceâ Cos. Do not tempt the Gods Again with perjuries. SCENE XIII. Enter Laodice, and Emira. Laod. I come, my lord, Obedient to your summons. Cos. Hear me, Siroes, 'Tis the last time: once more I offer mercy. Speak and ascend the throne; and with the throne Possess Laodice; but if thou still Persist in silence, in a dungeon's gloom Expect thy death. Hydaspes, in my stead, Shall here be present, name to him the traitor, I leave thee for awhile, do thou improve The few remaining moments; but if then Thou see'st the thunder fall, the fault is thine That hast refus'd to avert the impending stroke. By thee my pity now is flown, My breast with rage on flame; And, traitor, 'tis by thee alone I bear a tyrant's name. Thou can'st not say the guilt is mine, That sentence waits on thee: O! no, ingrate, 'tis only thine And not the king's decree. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Siroes, Emira, Laodice. Sir. [to himself.] On what shall I resolve? Em. Ye happy lovers, Hydaspes joys to see your fortune smile. O! what has future time in store for Persia From such an union; should the rising offspring Reflect the mother's charms and father's virtues? Sir. [to himself.] And does she mock me too? Laod. May favouring Heaven Improve the gladsome omen! Silent still? He seems irresolute and lost in thought. Em. [to Sir.] Speak, for 'twere madness longer to dissemble. Sir. O! Heavens!âAway and leave me. Em. Well thou know'st The king has charg'd thee in Hydaspes' presence To choose a prison or Laodice. Laod. On what wilt thou resolve? Sir. I leave Hydaspes To fix my choice: his will shall be my law. Meantime I go, amidst my chains, to expect What fate determines next. Em. I know not, princeâ Sir. Thou hast known enough to torture me till now, [aside.] And may Emira share the pangs I suffer. My breast a thousand passions rend, A thousand racking doubts contend:â On thee my last resolves depend; [to Em. To rule my heart is thine. Say, must I now for death prepare? At your command my fate I dare: Or should you bid me woo the fair, Your will, alas! is mine. [Exit. SCENE XV. Emira, Laodice. Em. [aside.] How shall I now address Laodice? Laod. Hydaspes, on the sentence of thy lips My happiness and Persia's fate depend. Em. It seems that unconstrain'd Laodice Would give herself in marriage ties to Siroes. Laod. That were indeed a bliss. Em. You love him then? Laod. My fondest thoughts are his. Em. And do you hope His hand will everâ Laod. Yes, by thee I hope To see it given to mine. Em. Your hopes are vain. Laod. And wherefore, say? Em. Shall I disclose my secret? Laod. With freedom speak. Em. I am myself a lover; Forgive my boldnessâI adore your beauties. Laod. Mine, mine, Hydaspes? Em. Yours, Laodice? Ah! who unmov'd could view those locks of gold, Those roseate cheeks, and lips of coral hue, That ivory breast, and those soft-beaming eyes? Ah! should you doubt what flame consumes my heart Look in this face and read my passion there. Laod. And silent yet till nowâ Em. Till now respect Restrain'd my tongue. Laod. Then mark me well, Hydaspes, I never can return thy love. Em. O! Heaven! Too cruel fair. Laod. If it be true thou lov'st me, Be friend to my affections; give to me, With virtue that becomes thy noble nature, The prince belov'd. Em. You claim too much from virtue. Laod. Siroes is lost. Em. Heaven guards the innocent. Laod. If hope to thee should feign thou hast my pity, Know hope deceives thee Em. Can you be so cruel? Laod. My cruelty was taught me by Hydaspes. Em. O! give me patience, Heaven! Load. Yes, while I live, I'll hate thee still, nor shalt thou e'er have cause To scoff at my misfortunes. Em. Yet one comfort At least remainsâboth share the pangs of love. Laod. When safe in port my vessel rides, You drive me back to stormy tides, And sink me in the main. But love may give you soon to know An equal share of equal woe, Such woe as I sustain. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Emira alone. Such various shapes, as love and hatred sway, I take by turns, that oft my mind perplex'd In passion's maze, scarce knows its own design. I hate the tyrant, and to take his life Would singly little fear a thousand bands Of foes in arms: but then the thought recurs That he is father to the man I love. Yes, Siroes is myself, and O! with grief I see his danger which myself have caus'd: But when I think he is the tyrant's son, O! then my heart is rent with secret anguish, Alike in hatred, and in love unhappy. Why was not I by Heaven decreed, A shepherdess to tread the plain? My bosom then no cares would breed, But care my tender lambs to feed And join in love some simple swain. But princes, born in regal state, Still find their fortune insincere; Since near the throne for ever wait In ambush plac'dâDeceit and Fear. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A court yard. Cosroes, Araxes. Cos. Araxes, he must die: enough till now Has nature pleaded for him in this bosom, Ar. Who will ensure you, sir, that, Siroes dead, The people will not seek to avenge his death? And that the means employ'd to quell the tumults, May not increase them? Cos. Be it thine, Araxes, With vigorous secrecy to oppose the plans Of these seditious; and to them be shewn, The sever'd head of my degenerate son. Soon shalt thou see rebellion's current dried When once the fountain fails. Ar. Before we prove A remedy like this, we may employ Some other not so dreadful. Cos. And what other Remains untried? Hydaspes and myself Have toil'd, and toil'd in vain,âthis rebel son Thirsts for my blood, refuses every gift, And still persists in obstinate concealment. Ar. Then must I, O! my liegeâ Cos. Yes, goâAraxes, His death is needful for me; I pronounce The fatal sentenceâbut, O Heaven! I feel My heart congeal'd, my eyes o'erflow'd with tears, And shedding Siroes' blood I shed my own. Ar. With anguish I obey; but yet, my lord, I will obey: 'tis true I'm Siroes' friend, But I am Cosroes' subject: well my heart, My loyal heart knows what that name implies, That all must yield before its sacred duties. To keep a loyal subject's name Your blood I cruel shed: Whene'er a monarch's peace may claim A guilty rebel's head, We praise the tyrant's law, and blame The heart to pity bred. [Exit. SCENE II. Cosroes alone. Before I prov'd the frowns of angry Heaven, I then was blest in life and blest in empire: But to preserve them, since my heart must suffer A punishment so dreadful, life and empire Are both a burden. SCENE III. Enter Laodice. Laod. Haste, my king! the palace Is now encompass'd by a rebel-band That call for Siroes. Cos. They shall have their wish: They shallâalready to a faithful arm His death is given in charge: perhaps even now Through many a wound his treacherous soul is fled, And thus I give him to his friends. Laod. O Heaven! Wretched Laodice!âWhat have you done? [to Cos. Cos. What have I done? Aveng'd offended majesty, Aveng'd offended love, thy wrongs and mine. Laod. O! you are deceiv'd! Reverse the cruel order, The prince has never injur'd you in loveâ 'Twas falsehood, falsehood all. Cos. What say'st thouâha! Laod. In vain I strove to win the heart of Siroes, Till fir'd with rage, to punish his disdain, I forg'd the tale. Cos. Hast thou betray'd me too? Laod. Yes, Cosroes, here behold the criminal: Let me be slain, but let the guiltless live. Cos. What, guiltless! he who sought a father's life? Who kindled in thy breast the flame of love? He's guilty, guilty of the worst of treason; Guilty of pleasing theeâand he shall die. Laod. To obtain the life of a devoted son, And from a father, was a gift so mighty I ought not to have hop'd it.âWhat avail These hapless charms, that fail to move your pity? You never lov'd me, 'twas deception all. Cos. Ungrateful maid! I lov'd thee but too well: I meant to seat thee on the Persian throne; Nor is this all: within my bosom brood A thousand cares: I know that thou art false, And yet, (O! shame to think!) I could confess That many pangs I feel are caus'd by thee. Laod. Then yield, my lord, to my entreaties yield: O! save the prince, and let my death appease you, Most happy if my bloodâ Cos. Laodice, Depart: by seeking thus to save his life, Thou mak'st his guilt the moreâthy suit offends me. Laod. The tigress see by nature stung, When danger threatens near, Impetuous flies to guard her young Against the hunter's spear. I ne'er like thine a heart have known, No love can there reside; Nor pity can in him be shown By whom a son has died. [Exit. SCENE IV. Cosroes alone. Now let us see how far my fate will urge Her barbarous rigour: yes, I'll meet it all. SCENE V. Enter Emira. Em. O sir! release the prince, restore him now To appease the furious people: threatening loud On every hand, with undistinguish'd cries They vent their maddening rage, and in a moment From shouting multitudes resounds the name Of Siroes. Cos. Is the tumult then so high? Em. The lowest of the vulgar now assume The pride of rebels: in ten thousand hands Ten thousand falchions flash; and such the frenzy, That creeping age and timorous childhood fly With arms and weapons to supply the strong. Cos. Resist the tumult yet some moments longer And I no more shall fear it. Em. Say, what mean My sovereign's words? Cos. Already is Araxes Dispatch'd by my command to slay my son. Em. And could'st thou thus resolveârevoke, O Heaven! The fatal sentenceâI myself will go The harbinger of mercyâgive me, sir, The royal signet. Cos. Thou in vain demand'st it: His death must be my safety. Em. O! how chang'd Art thou from Cosroes! where are now the virtues That grac'd thee once, companions in the throne? Ah! what will Persia say, and what the world? Cosroes till now the idol of his subjects, And terror of his foes; whose conquering arms, By wealthy Ganges and the fertile Nile, The furthest Ind and Ãthiop's tawny sons Admir'd and fear'd? O! think what thou hast lost, In one dread moment! If thou canst forget The laws of nature thus, one fatal act Blots all thy gloriesâStill, O! still reflect, Yet, yet recallâ Cos. But Siroes is a traitor. Em. But Siroes is your son, a son that ever Was worthy you, who from his father's deeds Has learn'd so well to triumph: yet a child Cosroes in him avow'd his hope and joy. Oft have I heard that, when array'd in arms, You sought the foe, or came victorious home, His was the parting and returning kiss; While playful he stretch'd out his little hands To clasp a father's neck, and fearless smil'd To see the dazzling helm and nodding plume. Cos. How hast thou wak'd remembrance! Em. Yet this son Is doom'd to death, and doom'd, O! Heaven! by whom? A father's voice. Cos. I can resist no longerâ Em. O! if my service ever claim'd reward, O! let not Siroes perish. Send me hence Resolveâa moment more the deadly stroke May then be past recall. Cos. Here, take my signet, And fly to save him. Em. O! transporting sounds. [going meets Araxes. SCENE VI. Enter Araxes. Em. Araxes, Heavens! Cos. With anguish in his looksâ O! Gods! Em. Speak, lives the prince? Ar. He lives no longer. Em. O! Siroes! Cos. O! my son! Ar. At once he fell, And by a single stroke: his generous soul One moment linger'd on his dying lips To cryââAraxes, guard my father's lifeââ Then fled for ever. Cos. O! support me, Heaven! Hydaspes, O! I faint! Em: Inhuman! thou! Dost thou lament! and who has murder'd Siroes? Say, barbarous man! of whom do'st thou complain? Go, tyrant! go, and from his bosom rend The heart still panting; sate thy rage with blood, With filial blood! a spectacle of horror, The stain of Persia and the world's abhorrence! Cos. Is this Hydaspes speaks? has frenzy seiz'd him, Or does he feign this madness? Em. Till this hour He feign'd indeed, but feign'd till time should serve To pierce the heart of Cosroes. Cos. How has Cosroes Deserv'd thy hatred? Em. Impious! how deserv'd? Hast thou not murder'd now my plighted lord? By thee I've lost a father, and by thee Have liv'd an exile from my rightful throne. Behold in me thy foeâI am Emira. Cos. What do I hear! Ar. O! wonderful discovery! Cos. Now do I know who 'twas seduc'd my son. Em. 'Tis true, I tried, but vainly tried to shake His faith to theeâthis learn for my revenge. And know, perfidious! from Emira's hatred He watch'd thy safety: know 'twas he who plac'd That warning paper: know, 'tis he who dies A guiltless victim; know, that each suspicion, And charge against this truth was falsehood all. Goâthink, and if thou can'st in peace repose. Cos. Araxes, let her be reserv'd in chains To satiate my resentment. Ar. I obey. [to Em.] Resign thy sword. Em. My hand alone disarms me: Thereâtake my weapon. [gives her sword to Arax. who goes out and returns with a guard [to Cos.] Be not thou deceiv'd To hope that threats can terrify Emira. Cos. Leave me, ingrate! society like thine But adds to what I feel. Em. Let Cosroes' guilt, Without my aid, suffice to make him wretched, [Exit guarded. SCENE VII. Cosroes, Araxes. Cos. Where am I! cruel, cruel recollection! Do I yet live? Ar. Take comfort, dear my lord: Think what may now preserve your threaten'd empire; Think of your own repose. Cos. I hope for none. My subjects are my enemies, and Fate Is arm'd against me. Heaven has not a star That shines on Cosroes with propitious beams; And I myself am now my worst of foes. Through every vein benumb'd with cold, I feel the lazy current roll'd, And, hovering round, with dread behold A murder'd son's lamented shade. And now alas! too late I find, By me to cruel death consign'd, A youth the noblest of his kind, A heart by every virtue sway'd. [Exit. Ar. Bring back the prisoner. [Emira brought in by the guards. SCENE VIII. Araxes, Emira. Ar. Now, benignant stars! Succeed my great designs. Retire. [to the guards who go out. Em. What would An impious king's more wicked minister? Must I prepare for death? Ar. No, mighty princess; Live and preserve yourself for him you love, Your plighted lordâfor know that Siroes lives. Em. Is't possible? Ar. I gladly from the king Receiv'd the fatal charge; but 'twas to employ The means to save him. Em. Wherefore from the father, Repentant of the deed, conceal his safety? Ar. Because to me it seem'd his pity rose, As fear subsided: should he now be told That Siroes lives, his pity might again Be chang'd to fear: for pity sways no more When stronger fear prevails: the first is rais'd By other's pains, the second by our own. Em. But where is Siroes? Ar. He in chains expects His speedy death. Em. Hast thou not yet ensur'd The prince's safety? Ar. I must first collect My faithful friends securely to conduct him, Where now the impatient people wait his presence; And since the father thinks him dead, with ease We may complete our purpose. Em. Let us henceâ [going. But ah! Medarses comes. Ar. Be not dismay'd, I will depart: do you awhile remain, And learn what next the treacherous prince designs: Fear notâbe constant. Em. I confide in thee. [Exit Araxes. SCENE IX. Emira, Medarses. Em. What cause disturbs you, sir? Med. All is in tumult, And would'st thou have me unconcern'd Hydaspes? Em. [aside.] As yet he knows me not. [to Med.] Then let us hence To oppose these daring rebels. Med. Other succour Our danger claimsâI hasten now to Siroes. Em. And mean'st thou then to free the unworthy author Of all our evils? Med. Think me not so senselessâ I go to take his life. Em. I heard that Siroes Had breath'd his last. Med. Ha! dead! by whom, Hydaspes? Em. I know not whom, for doubtful and confus'd To me the rumour came. And thou, Medarses, Didst thou not hear? Med. The tidings never reach'd me. Em. Then 'twas some fiction by the people fram'd. Med. No matter what: alive or dead, it now Imports me much that Siroes should be found. Em. I go before thee, and whate'er thy purpose, Hydaspes will performâI've heard enough. [aside, Exit. SCENE X. Medarses alone. No, if a brother cross my path to empire, He must not live: though nature shrinks to act, Necessity compels it. Time that presses, Big with surrounding evils, leaves me now No other means, and in the last extreme Of danger, every remedy is just. Though brother's blood may stain the crown, Its splendor ne'er decays: The crime that leads us to the throne, Condemn'd for ill success alone, All, when successful, praise. [Exit. SCENE XI. A part of the castle destined for the prison of Siroes. Siroes alone. I'm weary now of suffering, cruel Gods! Your anger longer: what to me avail My innocence and virtue? While the loyal Remain depress'd, the traitor is exalted. If thus AstrÃ¦a weighs the deeds of men, Or chance must rule, or innocence is guilt. SCENE XII. Enter Emira. Em. [entering.] Araxes truly spoke, my Siroes lives. Sir. Emira! say, how hast thou gain'd admittance Amidst my rigorous guards? Em. This royal signet Procur'd me entrance. Sir. Whence didst thou receive it? Em. From Cosroes' self. Sir. If to conclude my woes, My father chooses thee his minister; For such a death, to die by hands so lov'd, I pardon all the malice of my fate. Em. Then hear and judge Emiraâ SCENE XIII. Enter Medarses. Med. [entering.] Fear not, guards, The king has sent me. Em. O! ye Powers! Med. Hydaspes Already here, and here without thy sword In my defence? Em. But now, upon my entrance, The guards disarm'd meâWould to Heaven Araxes Were yet arriv'd! [aside looking out. Sir. And does Medarses come Again to insult me? On what distant shore Can Siroes hide him from a faithless brother? Med. Peace, or thou diest. [draws his sword. Em. The guilty little suffer In meeting death they wish: some moments still Suspend the stroke: reflection then will shew him Its utmost horrors: I meantime may vent My hatred in reproaches: well you know He is my foe, that even within the palace His sword was drawn against Hydaspes' life. Sir. Must I endure all this? Em. [aside.] O! would to Heaven, Araxes were arriv'd! [looking out. Sir. And can Hydaspes, Forgetting faith and friendship, join a traitor? Med. Peace or thou diest. Sir. Kill, kill me, cruel man; The death were doubly welcome, that remov'd Such objects now, so painful to my sight. Med. Die thenâmy heart recoils. [aside. Em. [aside.] Help, mighty Gods! Med. [aside.] I feel, I know not how, some secret horror Unnerve my arm. Sir. Barbarian! why this pause? Em. [aside.] And yet he comes not. [looking out. Med. [aside.] What unmans me thus? Em. [to Med.] Thy colour changes: to my hand resign The weapon, and by me shall justice pierce His treacherous heart. Hydaspes can alone Exact revenge for those his deeds have wrong'd. Med. There, use it in my stead. [gives the sword to Em. Sir. [to Em.] And am I then So hateful to thee? Em. [to Sir.] Now, thou false-one, see What hope for thy escapeâDefend thyself, My dearest Siroes!âthis shall guard thy life. [delivers him the sword. Med. What hast thou done, Hydaspes? Wilt thou thus Betray me, him who trusts his all to thee? Em. No! thou art deceiv'd; no longer I'm Hydaspesâ Behold in me Emira. Sir. Ha! what means Emira now? Med. Ah! traitors! at my voice The guards shall seize on both. Sir. Peace or thou diest. [threatens him. SCENE XIV. Enter Araxes, and Guards. Ar. Haste, Siroes, haste. Med. Defend thy lord, Araxes. Ar. Araxes comes but in defence of Siroes. Med. Perfidious traitor! Arax. [to Sir.] All Selucia yields To your command; then let us not delay, But with your presence cheer your faithful friends. The passage now is free; and these I leave For your protection: come and learn, my prince, What I till now have wrought for your deliverance. [Exit. Guards remain. SCENE XV. Siroes, Emira, Medarses, Guards. Med. O! Heavens! all, all forsake me! Em. Let us go, My dearest Siroes, nor neglect the good By favouring fortune given: pursue my steps, Behold the path that leads you to the throne. Sir. Is it then true, thou treasure of my soul, That thou no longer now art Siroes' foe? What torture did I feel to think thee false? Em. And couldst thou ever doubt Emira's truth? Sir. Forgive me, best belov'd, but Siroes lives A wretch so hateful now to every star; What else might seem impossible, if leagu'd Against my peace, I can believe it all. Em. Think not those eyes shall ever cease To rule Emira's heart; Nor think that I would wound thy peace, With wiles of female art. Those eyes, whose power could first inspire The flame my breast retains, Shall nourish there the gentle fire, While vital breath remains. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Siroes, Medarses, Guards. Med. O! Siroes, I confess the rightful fate From which, in me, you have preserv'd a traitor; And more, believe me, I detest the guilt Than fear the punishment. Ascend the throne. But first, as here I stand without defence, Cut short this wretched being. Sir. Take thy sword: [gives his sword. Live still, in this embrace receive my pardon. Do thou, with better faith, restore A brother's love, I ask no more, No more the past review. Expect a purer peace of mind, Since now thy foot, from ill declin'd Shall honour's paths again pursue. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Medarses alone. Alas! I now by sad experience learn That innocence is still the surest guide. He who confides in guilt, should Fortune frown, Has nothing left; but he who puts his trust In virtue, though depress'd with every suffering, Enjoys life's sovereign blessing, peace of mind. A torrent foul that deeper grows, While wintry storms its waves supply; No longer swell'd by melting snows, And mountain floods, more slowly flows, And leaves at length its channel dry. The purer stream, that from the veins Of porous earth derives it source, Though fed no more by drenching rains, With waters purified from stains, Continues still its gentle course. [Exit. SCENE XVII. A great square in Seleucia; a view of the royal palace, with magnificent preparations for the coronation of Medarses, which are afterwards used for the coronation of Siroes. At the opening of the scene a skirmish appears between the insurgents and royal guards: the last are defeated and driven off. Cosroes and Emira with drawn swords: Cosroes defending himself against some of the conspirators; he falls. Cos. I am not conquer'd yet. Em. Forbear, my friends, This stroke is mine. [advancing on Cosroes. SCENE XVIII. Enter Siroes, his sword drawn. Sir. [interposing.] Emira, hold! what dost thou? Fear not, my father, Siroes is your guard. Em. O! cruel fate! [aside. Cos. And dost thou live, my son! Sir. I live, and live to die in your defence. Cos. And who preserv'd thy life. SCENE XIX. Enter Araxes and people. Ar. [entering.] 'Twas I preserv'd him. I wish'd to free the prince, yet keep my truth Unshaken to my king: your faithful people Require no more. If Cosroes should refuse To absolve me for the past, the power is his To punish my deceit. Cos. O! fair deceit! SCENE LAST. Enter Medarses, and Laodice. Med. My father. Laod. O! my king. Med. [kneels.] Behold Medarses Now sues for pardon, or for punishment. Laod. I too am guilty, and submissive bend Before my judge: 'twas I that chiefly rais'd This cruel tempest. Cos. Siroes is the offended. Sir. Siroes forgets the offenders and the offence; And thou, Emira, calm at length thy anger. Ah! think how ill the name of foe unites With her, the object of my soul's affection: Dismiss thy love, or think no more of vengeance. Em. I can resist no longer: such example Of godlike virtue from my breast removes All former hatred. Cos. [to Em.] Henceforth let the throne With you for ever prove the seat of peace: Siroes shall be your spouse. Em., Sir. O! happy day! Cos. Persia, behold your king: from me the crown Shall pass to Siroes' head. I gladly here Resign the charge; and he whose earliest years Were spent for you, shall better now sustain, With vigorous youth, the burden of dominion. Chorus. The man, who knows that peace sincere Which warms the virtuous breast, Forgets those passions, rage and fear, The foes to mortal rest. If nourish'd in the lap of grief, Our joys can vigour gain; This thought should give the wretch relief: âThat pleasure follows pain.â END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
