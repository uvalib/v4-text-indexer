      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Exterior of King Pepin's Palace. Great Preparations to receive the Return of the Troops: Bells, &amp;c. Concourse of Knights, Ladies, Attendants, &amp;c. Busy Scene. Opening Chorus. Hail him, greet him! rush in a mob to meet him! With your choicest liquors prepare to treat him! Hear him, cheer him! champagne and claret and beer him! Noise, noise, dear boys, kick up a pleasing shine! We'll now have all we axes, Reduced will be the taxes! For he a lad of wax is the handsome Valentine! Ring bells, shout swells! let all to mirth incline! To-day, no pay, for all we'll gratis dine! We're happy as can be, lads! On that we'll all agree, lads, We'll have a howling spree, lads, All thanks to Valentine! Soon we'll see the victors in the field advancing! Shields all bright and many a snowy, waving plume; Swords so keen, and steeds with glittering harness prancing! Room for those who have so nobly conqueredâroom! Ring bells, &amp;c. Among them all one must shine, For ever hero, Valentine! Whose honour is so pure and bright, As well at home as in the fight! The glories of the field belong To him for whom we raise this song. Hail, champion of the fatal fray! Enter Hugo. Hugo. Here! stop that din, my playful girls and boys! My ears you don't know how a noise annoys! Pac. It's only zeal! Hugo. (Polishing a shield) Each one who makes a rout Will âcatch itâ for his zealâas he'll find out! (fanning himself) It's like two English counties, I'd be stating, A Norfolk crowd, and heat that's Suffolk-ating! Bland. We don't mean to be talked to, sir, by you! Rab. He always was a cheeky lot! Bert. That's true! Pac. But any one's allowed to make a shine Who toadies that âperfection,â Valentine! Bland. A Foundling! Pooh! Bert. A nobody! Hugo. (Sneering) Rave on! You're awfully courageous while he's gone? But presentâhe would chop you to the chine For half that speech Enter Henry and Haufray. Hauf. Who would? Hugo. Why, Valentine! Like bits of twigs from off that broken pine! Henry. Who are you speaking of? Hugo. Why, Valentine! My master!âyours! Oh! put those swords away! Beside him, where will you be, please, to-day? 'Twere folly, sure, comparison to raise 'Twixt carpet-knights, and his victorious days! I had you there!ânot that I want you! (goes up) Hauf. (bringing Haufray down) Brother! Henry. 'Arry!âexcuse the âHâ! Hauf. I'm fit to smother! I am a splendid man!âfull! plump! not bony Strong, asâwell, not to boastâa Shetland pony Yetâsomehowâdo you see my drift? Henry. I do! I see you drift from what I had in view! You wish toâ? Hauf. Hush! The banquet!âfill his cupâ After the sweets!â Henry. Pies on! To that I'm âupâ! Hauf. Then!âwhen the potion he has not a thought onâ Be the drugged article to fill his, brought on! Henry. Hush!âwe're observed! (they go up) Hugo. There's brewing evil weather When you get putting your two heads together! Hauf. A hireling knave! Hugo. But master here could see One true as steel! Hauf. (sneering) Steel! Hugo. (nodding head) Hence his hirin' me! Talking of metal, here's a warrior's shield! Was a bit rusty from the battle-field. But, since I've polished it, looks good as new! She's like a blessed mirror! Yes! she'll do! Make a good looking-glass! But, I'll confess, (pointing off to palace) With that good-looking lass you're no success! Hauf. (to Henry, aside) It's evident, from this excess of cheek, Against us somebody at Court must speak! It also strikes meâ(you observed his sneer?) That Eglantine don't love me much! Henry. Same here In vain to answer âYes,â I try to rush her, To each appeal her answer is a crusher! Hauf. To every compliment she makes demur! Hugo. âCrusher!â She doesn't care a bawbee, sir!â Scotch for a halfpenny! Hauf. Oh, thanks! so much! Halfpenny! bawbee! might be Greek or Dutch! Hugo. I'd bet a bob he don't live in this nation. Who'd give a halfpenny for your penetration! But soon, my lively parties, you'll be dumb, Or sing a smaller tune, when master's come. Trio and Chorus. âThe Lodger's Come.â (Haufray, Henry, and Hugo.) Hugo. It's very well to bully, and you've certainly contrived Your very humble servant to abuse; But your rosy time is over now the real swell's arrived, And I notice you're delighted at the news! You've had sinecures by dozens, and the revenues you've drained, And, like other jolly dogs, you've had your day; But you'll now have to surrender all the spoil you have obtained, And the public will enchanted be to sayâ âI'm sorry to disturb you, but the Great Man's come! I'm not at all astonished that you look so glum! You'll disgorge the blessed lot, And your plans will go to pot, And you'll find that you're not in it, now the Right Man's come!â Hauf. If you've done with your tirade, Sir, may we just slip in a word? (Understand, though, not the least in self-defence! We shall be prepared for action, ere these wonders have occurred, And we don't intend to yield to mere pretence! Henry. We're as good as your pet, Valentine, the too effulgent swell, Who means to take our livelihood away! Hauf. There's a rod in pickle waiting, Mr. Toady, I can tell, And I'd like to know what now you dare to say? Hugo. (after a pause, getting them near him)â I'm sorry to disturb you, but my master's come! From the posts you have commanded he the pair will drum. You are humbugs, and you look it! 'Pon my soul, you'd better hook it, For your goose he means to cook it, now the Right Man's come! Pac. The King! (cheers) Hauf. Whose throne we mean to try for, eh? (aside to Henry) Henry. Rather! Ha! ha! Hush! (to Hugo) (aloud to Hugo) Hugo, you go 'way! Flourish. Enter Pepin and Court. Pep. Thanks, thanks, my people, for this cheering dutiful, It's most affecting, but it isn't beautiful! I love you, 'cos you keep me very decently, And raised a much desired loan, too, recently. You also fightâto me no joy inviting!â And (bless you for it!) pay for all your fighting! (Hugo has been filling a tankard) And so from loyalty I scorn to shrinkâ Only one thing is wanting nowâ Hugo. (presenting tankard) A drink! Pep. Take, for this timely proffer of good cheer, (affected) This kindly purse! Go on, and purse-severe! (hands purse) Well, gents, we're done, at last, with war's alarms, And victory complete has crowned our arms! Once more amongst the nations we can shine, I needn't tell you, thanks toâ All. (except Hen. and Hauf.) Valentine! Hauf. I burst with spite! (aside) Henry. With rage my heart is swelling! (aside) Hauf. Arrah be japers! I'm on for rebelling! (aside) Up to this time no rival has gainsaid usâ The King's advanced us, petted us, and paid us, And now this mere adventurer appears, Becomes first favouriteâ (Hugo listens) Henry. And I've my fears He'llâbut this scurvy treatment he shall rue! Who, after this, would hesitate? Hauf. Quite true! Even a worm would turn! Hugo. Don't wish to bore you! (close to them) But I've heard all! Ha! ha! âThere's wormwood for you!â You think, because King Pepin's mild and old, He hasn't a protector, smart and bold! You fancy you've his crown already won, Because he lost in early youth a son! Hauf. Two, so the story goes! Oh! you're a bad one! I don't believe, in fact, he ever had one! Pep. (overhearing) Who says I never had a son? My stars! (about to make naughty revelations) We won't descend, though, to particulars! Hauf. We meant âsuccessors.â Hem! (sneering) Pep. The puppy'd joke us! (to Hugo) You tell the tale! Recital, sirs, would choke us! (goes up) Hugo. The late Queen's life was not âcouleur de rose!â Faults on both sides, sirsâso the story goes! Neither, of course, would yieldâas you'll suppose! One day she left himâso the story goes! Within the forest there she bore him twins! Hauf. That's where the interest of the tale begins! (sneering) She said a bear stole one!âattentive mother! And pray, what fable have you of the other? Hugo. You know a child was found, and we supposeâ Hauf. Valentine! Pooh! That's where your story âgoes!â Breaks up and failsâ Hugo. Yes; there's a lot in that! Yet it might beâ Hauf. Might be a gipsy's brat! (trumpet) Pep. My nieceâwith every courtesy address her! She's got a devil of a temperâbless her! A spirit almost upon man's abutting! (flourish) Enter Eglantine. (She has a lot of branches and wild-flowers, and looks a tomboy.) Egl. It's all right, governor. I've been out nutting! Pep. Out in those woods again? Egl. Yes! That's quite true! Hauf. Nutting? Egl. All right. It's nutting, sir, to you! Such larks! (to King) Pep. With sorrow I could now be sobbin', The lark I have need set no heart th-robbin'! Oh! those wild woods! My life, I now begin it! Only a lark, and such a little in it! Only a blackberry, just here and there, Or, pr'aps, the slyly setting of a snare. There's-ne'er a keeper but will own a twinge When he hears me sing out, âSpringe, gentle Springe!â Hugo. 'Twas I that in that blitheful art did âcoachâ her! Hauf. You egged her on, we know, Pep. Egg on; oh! poacher! SongâEglantine. (Russian Melody.) Though a tomboy me you call, I don't care! All I dare! I climb up trees, and seldom fall, I'm sound in wind and limb! Dull courts I can't stand 'em, As bores I brand 'em, I rove at random. I'd like to shoot or drive a tandem, I've learned to row, to box, and swim. Why should women loll at ease? Mild as milk, soft as silk! It's always ease amongst us âshe's,â (To men I don't allude!) Give me pleasure stronger, Court rules, who'd heed 'em? I'm on for freedom! And skirts like theseânot longer! So, you observe, I'm not a prude. (at conclusion, trumpets) Hugo. Master! I'm off! To greet him he must find me! Gents allââI leave my character behind me!â (exit) Hauf. Best place for it! Egl. Oh! Don't so jeer and flaunt one! He leaves his character.âBe quickâyou want one! Don't you talk love to me. I'd make âsans doute,â A clean sweep of you, 'cos I spurn your soot! Each glance, sir, I accept with condemnation! A nasty risk each note of admiration! In shortâ Hauf. Yes? Egl. It applies to one and t'other! Hauf. We'll go and get an âS.-and-B.â Henry. Yes, brother! (exeunt) Trumpets.âProcession. Enter Valentine and Hugo. Cheers. Pep. A thousand thanks for this distinguished visit! Hail! hail! stout warrior! Val. Hale!âwell! where is it? In battle from privation I don't shrink, At peaceâI'm thirsty, and I want a drink! Egl. My Valentine! Val. This is a sweet surprise! (embraces her) Hugo. Just now âdrink to him only with thine eyes!â (hands tankard to Val.) Egl. So you're returned, victorious as ever! It's well to have a general so clever! I think you saidâ? Val. Quite true this lady speaks! I said âthe war'll be over in three weeks, At noonââat twelve we did the trick, precisely, I like to manage these affairs, sir, nicely! I've smashed and subjugated all a nation! Twelve? Yes!âten minutes just for variation! (all consult watches) Pep. Our best reward!â Val. I try, I'm sure, to earn it! Egl. My Pearl of Gen'rals! Val. Not pearl, dearâGarnet! Even a Peerage cannot raise my fame; What's Baron honour to my ancient name? Hugo. We don't agree to that! and you won't brag! Egl. Where'er you've been you've never lowered our flag! The flag of France! Val. Like puddings, love, of yore! Egl. Puddings? Val. Yes, âroleys,â with the âtreacle o'er!â (tricolor) Pep. Now you've returned, we'll live in rout and dance! It will be vive l'amour while ve've la France! We think your conduct, sir, is simply ârippin'!â Val. Yes, all has ended apple-y, my Pepin! Egl. You're very clever, and you're very brave, How did you manage, then, you're life to save? Val. Just for expedience, my head I screened it, (taking shield from Hugo.) 'Twas thus I held my shield! Hugo. And Hugo cleaned it! Val. Like mud away my enemies I shovelled, Standing upright, like this! Hugo. And Hugo grovelled Grovelânot mud! Val. All warrior, I looked it! I scorned to yield an inch! Hugo. And Hugo hooked it! Egl. For war or wisdom we on you rely! Val. Remember, too, each expedition made is Not for reward, but to oblige the ladies. SongââI'd do it for Mary Ann.â Valentine. In me you scan a lady's man! With pride I this declare! To please the sex, myself perplex, I do beyond my share. Young, old, high, lowâno change I knowâ I love them all I can! I can kiss and caress a grand princess Or worship a Mary Ann! If they told me to go to Jericho, I think that I should do it! If they said make a dash and spend your cash, I'd take the lot and blue it! If they told me to jump, or work a pump, Or be an organ man, I think that, without the slightest doubt, I should do it for Mary Ann! I'd join the Ribbon Army Which adopts the colour Blue! I'd sit for hours amid sun-flowers, Disgustingly âtoo too!â I'd put on rags, and chalk the flags, Drink champagne with a spoon! I'd trade in silks, or beer, or whilks, Fetch green cheese from the moon If she told me to try to fly the sky Or turn the prison cranks, Or swallow a pill, or make my will In one of the Brighton tanks! If she told me to wait thro' a late debate, And tackle the âgrand old man!â To a tax be resigned, or a Bobby to findâ I'd do it for Mary Ann! Pep. As wise as warlike! Val. Sir! I've never boasted But Valentines are rather widely posted! Egl. But come where luncheon and champagne delight us, And sweetest strains, dear, to the dance invite us! Val. Don't want to dance St. Vitus! What d'ye mean? (aside to Hugo) Hugo!âget all these people off the scene! Hugo (nodding) I understand! On this trick I am âbig!â Top of the tree! Val. Top of the tree? Hugo. 'I twig! Enter Haufray and Henry. Hauf. (to Val.) We've breakfasted quite early, we'd be stating! If you've had praise enough don't keep us waiting Egl. (makes at himâhe retreats) You dare toâyes! Step back! you'll find it safer! If you don't fear whacks what d'ye get a-way for? Henry. (to Hauf.) Don't be so rash! Val. (drawing) All right, my friend, you'll see! I'll pay you what I owes you, aujourdhui! Pep. No strife, my lords! to mar this happy day! Up with your swords! To luncheon! Lead the way. Hugo. He'd lick you, for a tanner, with one hand. (to Hauf.) Hauf. When you are ready, eh! you understand! (touching his sword, and to Val.) (Exeunt all but Val. and Eglantine) Val. If you would rather with that puppy go, Trot! Egl. And why âTrot?â Don't take a gal up so! You're much more likely to be faithless! Val. (quickly) Aren't! Egl. To gallivant; Val. You are the gal I vant! Soldiers are not like sailors, given to court, And find a chÃ©rie, love, in ev'ry port! Oh! I'm all right!âare you? I'd ask, my pet? Egl. You know that I adore you, so why fret? Val. Adore, yet quarrel? That's from true love far! Adore is not adore when it's a jar! Egl. Jar! oh, preserve me! for I think I am Fit to pass in a crowd! Val. Crowd! real jam! DuoââI shan't play with you any more.â Valentine and Eglantine. Val. Come, a truce to all your nonsense; D'ye think that I'm a child? Egl. You're impudent, bold, and forward! You make me almost wild! Val. Well! if you mean I turn your head, That's just what I would do! Egl. If you're rude I'll cry! Val. Me rude? Not I! What's gone wrong, love, with you? (They quarrel, smack each other's hands, &amp;c.) I shan't play with you any more! Egl. You're a flirt! Val. (coolly) Well! you've said so before! Egl. You're/I'm naughty, You are,/I am, and too forward by far! And I/She won't play with you/me any more! Egl. All the men are just deceivers! On womankind they prey! Val. You follow the fate of believers, So take your chance, I say! Egl. You know I love you more than life, My heart is all your own; Val. Soon the day will come when you're my wife! D'ye think you'll change your tone? (squabble) Egl. I shan't play with you anymore! Val. You won't when we've past the church-door. Egl. You're the dearest of men! Val. 'Twill be serious then! Both. And I shan't play with you any more! (Dance and exeunt. Gloomy music. The head of a large Black Bear looks over path L., and retires. Orson follows, carefully coming down. While still on path, he speaks. Orson. Arrived at last! For many miles I've travelled, And half the devious forest paths unravelled! An' revelled in 'em! for I love the trees! The good wood races such as mine should please! Although that point is doubtful in my case; Darwin consigns me to a lower place! His theory's a âcrotchettyâ and âwhimâ-y 'unâ They call me âOrson,â but my tribe is âSimianâ! Man-monkey! Pooh! Philosophers are blind Sometimes!âbut, pray, don't think I'm-onkey-ind! Tho' my ape-arance is against me! See! I'm rough and active! but it seems to me That Might is Right! so all my actions are fair! And I but wage, at best, gorilla warfare! For I will own I live but anyhow, My woodland manners ending in a bough. A hammock, too, tho' p'r'aps it seems a myth The only bed I am ac-quainted with! Song (original).âTune, âSam Hall.â Orson. I'm a child of Nature quite, Nothing less! A noble sort despite Want of dress! I say, when people stare, âIt's our first garb, you're aware!â And I've always 'ad 'em there! Rather, Yes! My want of clothes I felt When I fust Sat in the nude, to Belt,â (Torso, just!) They turned me into sport, Then troubles came,âin short, They modelled me in Courtâ Then I bust! I'm stalwart, straight and tall âTiddy fol loll!â That's not the tune at allâ It's âSam Hall!â Of cribbin' I've no fear, I pick up my tunes by ear, And my name does not appearâ Harry Wall! (confidentially) The King holds wassail late to-night, they're stating! This silken Court is always wacillatin'! Whilst I, the simple forest child (noise of revelry)âa clatter Of feasting!âso! that's mind!âwell, I am matter! I'll tap and learn (pulls up tree)âsuch means, see, I employ 'em! A tap!âI shouldn't like to much annoy 'em! (Sways tree and brings it against porch. Smash of glass, &amp;c. Listens.) I wonder if they heard?âthese tiny taps (seizes rock and hurls it through windows) Don't tell: They'll hear through raps: at least perhaps! Somebody's coming! Enter ServantâBeaujolais. Beau. Hallo!âeh, you scamp! Orson. (furious) Civilisation takes me for a tramp! (seizes him and pulls him up stage) Come here!âI'll teach you what is false or true! I'm Orson! (hurls him into the forest). It don't matter who are you! I hope I'm independent! Enter Valentine. Val. Who are you That 'gainst the King's gate beats this loud tattoo? 'Twill cost you, since this way you seek to pass, A pretty penny, sir, for broken glass! Orson. Ha, ha!âme pay! He, he! this is a go! Val. (imitating) âHa, ha!âyou'll have to pay what you Ho, ho! Orson. (angrily) The child of Nature scorns to pay! Val. (coolly) Quite so! Perhaps you'll put your things on, then, and go! Orson. (amazed) âPut on my things?â If, sir, as I suppose, You dimly are referring to my clothes, The child of Nature spurns 'em!âTo your wassail! Val. (quietly to him) Bathing is not allowed, sir, near the castle! Orson. Near to such silken fancies am I brought so? (loftily) The child of Nature doesn't bathe! Val. I thought so! Orson. No insult, puny thing! I will not brook it! Val. (inspecting him) âBrookâ implies waterâNo! you do not look it! Orson. Another slight! Beware of serious tussels! I've what exist in water on meâmuscles! Muscles! look on that arch, and you will see What a tremendous hoister I can be! (points to where he has thrown Beaujolais) Val.] That's a good shy! I think, beyond a doubt, (coolly) You'd make a fortune as a âchucker out.â (noise outside) But p'raps you'd best retire where gloom and shade is, Your want of costume might disturb the ladies! Orson. Ladies! Soft thingsâ In silken, soft, long dresses, With teeth like pearlsâ Val. They cost as much! Orson. And tresses I've never seen 'em, thoughâ (Trumpets, cheers, &amp;c.) Val. They've closed the dance! You've not seen woman, friend? Well, now's your chance! Look! From this hiding-place you'll see quite snugâ (points off) Orson. (fidgeting) I wish I'd got a great coat or a rug! I feel I want some garment, and I know it! If it were but a bearskinâ(which I show it!) DuoââQuite Another Thing.â Valentine and Orson.) Orson. I've heard, Sir, that âthe sauce for goose Is sauce for gander too.â Val. Precisely!âyou possess the right To do whate'er I do. So put that in your clumsy pipe! Orson. Most willinglyâbecause There is, in spite of your great type, No universal sauce! It's quite another thing, etc. Orson. Suppose I smash this place to bits, And show big proofs of force? Val. You'll get about your heads some hits, And be ârun in,â of course? Orson. The âChild of Natureâ must a shine Not kick up anyhow! Val. No! swells are âlet off with a fine,â If they get in a row! Quite another thingâ I'm a swell! Orson. And I'm a bird without a feather! And what is law for youâfor the âcommonerâ won't doâ That's quite another business altogether! Orson. Suppose two nations want to fight, Instruct me what they'd do! Val. Each land would hail it with delight, And find the money too! Orson. But, if we had a âturn-upâ here, And knocked ourselves about? Val. Police, of course, would interfereâ You'ld get a month, no doubt! It's quite another thingâ Val. There must be for two nations âlonger tether.â What with you 's âa sorry passââ Orson. Is âheroicâ in the mass! Yes! it's quite another matter altogether! Orson. If you a charming girl should meet, And pledge a marriage-vow, And then should leave the sweetââtoute de suiteâ?â Val. (coolly) Well, damages âa thou!â Orson. But if a lady jilts a gent, Whose heart was fixed and true, Does he get for the coin he's spent A little âthouâ or two? Val. That's quite another thingâ The lady always sails in pleasant weather; What for man 's âa scandal quiteââis an injured woman's âright!â It's quite another matter altogether! Enter Haufray and Henry. Hauf. What's this? a friend of yours! Nice piece of goods! The missing link! A wild man of the woods! Henry. Caged here at last! Enter Hugo. Hugo. We heard a smash of glass, (seeing Orson) Andâoh! I say! don't let the ladies pass! Val. This is the terror of the woods! Hugo. Quite so! Say he's an acrobat! They'll stand him so! Orson. (furious, but held by Val.) I'll take that thing there, like a bear, and hug it! Hugo. (in agony) For goodness' sake, lay down a bit or drugget! Master! these âfadsâ of yours will spoil your âshow!â Hauf. The King! the Princess! Orson. Damn it! let me go! Enter Eglantine, Pepin, and Court. Pep. (annoyed) What means this clatter? Can't outbreak be curbed? Why, when we're set for drinking, be disturbed? Hauf. You'd best ask Valentine! (Orson is hiding behind Val.) Egl. Of course you sneer! If he has aught to answer for, he's here! Val. (nodding) You're right, old girl! Egl. What are you hiding so? Some little sweet surprise for me, I know! Orson. Calls me a âsweet surprise!ââif I've my eyes! He, who is hiding me just now's her prize! (to Val.) Let me sneak off! Is that a woman? Val. Yes! Orson. I thought so! Don't she wear a lot of dress? Egl. I can't think what he's hidingâill at ease! Looks like âthree shies a pennyâ thro' the trees! Upon the object I my eye can't fix! Orson. She takes my limbs, as it appears, for sticks! Hugo. (to Val.) It's no good, master, you must trot him out! Pep. We want to know, please, what it's all about! Egl. Oh! (seeing Orson for a moment.) Orson. In the leaves, my limbs I'd now be rollin' 'em! Egl. A bather!âand some wretch his clothes has stolen 'em! Val. Not so!âthe unfettered child of Nature, see! (pulling Orson forward) The wild man of the forest! Orson. Yes! that's me! Val. That's âI!â (correcting) Orson. He's down upon me like a hammer! I'm me! and me's myself, a fig for grammar! Val. Here is his likeness, quite a thing exquisite, A photograph! What is called a carte de visite, It goes immensely in the public mart, It ought to goâit is an Orson carte. Orson. I'm Orson! yes, you all may look and stare! I've been brought up, well brought up, by a bear! Behold! (bear appears at top of slope) Egl. You shall be hung!âoh! sign of ruin! Look out! see there! there is some mischief brewin'! Orson. My mother! (pointing to bear) Hugo. Pooh! we'll seize the thing, and cage her! Orson. She nursed a minor, and can 'urse a major! Pep. (aside) A bear! my children! thoughts are flitting o'er me! I can't abear the sight that's now before me! Val. Orson! speak out! and send dispute to flinders! We own you've broken a rare lot of winders. Egl. Three pantries smashed up, and two doors you've riven! You've killed a servant, too, but that's forgiven! Hauf. The precious pet and toady of the King, May, so it seems to us, do anything! (Bear comes downâOrson embraces him) Val. Bear and for bear! Egl. I can't think how you do it! (to Orson) Orson. My wet-nurse! Yes! she will bear wet-nuss to it! I stole down here (the notion pray forgive!) To see how monarchsânoblemenâcould live; Egl. And the result? You like us;âor do not? Orson. Like you! Can't help it! but I'll fight the lot! Pep. Good gracious! We should treat this scene with hauteur! Val. No!âfree discussion! Don't go in for âClÃ´ture!â Is it to be a fight? (to Orson) Orson. A mite like you? Hugo. Perhaps I'm rather thicker!âwill I do? Val. Orson! I'll fight you! Orson. For your system, shocks Await you. I shall shy whole cliffs and rocks! (to bear) Come, mother. We are out of place down here! Egl. (to Val.) Oh! Do not run into such danger, dear! Val. Not I! Here! Hugo! I've on you reliance! What we can't do by strength, we do by science! Whisper! (they talk aside) Orson (aside) He's young, I do not want to fight him! But only for his kindness to requite him; Still, he's damned impudent! and Iâand Iâ The unfettered child of Nature, means to try! And youâ(kissing hands to Eglant.) Egl. Oh! you get out! Pep. This pleasant day, By this disturbance seems quite âput away.â Hugo. Master! I'm on! Val. Defiance, Orson! What? D'ye think we're made of paper, sir, or not? Orson. Come to the woods, and try conclusions there! Val. To-morrow, sir, at twelve! But bar the bear! Egl. I see your star of victory shine! Val. Orson, I'm at you! Orson. Same here, Valentine Concerted Piece. Val. Yes! Defiance! Into your teeth! Egl. You will have, sir, to fight! Orson. Nature! Val. Science! Pep. Question of right, then, not might! Egl. Here's a chance, now! Val. What's the suggestion, my charmer? Speak out! Hugo. One advance, now, Makes him a prisoner, quite! Hauf. To brutal strength he seems quite blind! Henry. The words I wished to whisper you! Orson. The child of Nature you will find Perhaps, a match for all of you! Ensemble. Pep., &amp;c. Still, there's a row, a general excitement! Orson. What odds to me/us so long as there's a fight meant? Egl. Well! this is quite a case! Val. Only name the time and place! (Repeat, as before) Here's defiance!âinto your teeth! You will have sirs/sir, to fight! Nature! Science! Question of right, then, or might!&amp;c. END OF ACT I.</field>

Well! for most qualities give me the ladies! Song.âEglantine. What makes men so bold? (the young or the old!) What gives supernatural strength? What makes them so weak they sometimes cannot speak Their sentiments freely at length? What troubles their mindâmakes them morally blindâ And all imperfections look o'er? What has thousands down-hurled from success in the world? And will do it, I fear, evermore! Why, the Ladies! Yes, the Ladies! Darlingsâif dark or fair! The world made is by the Ladies! Ruling it ev'rywhere! What makes life so sweet? Whatâpretty and neatâ The miser's tight purse-strings will draw? What leaves you in rags? What bullies and âknags?â What boasts an unlimited âjaw?â What saves you from sorrow, looks out for to-morrow, And scatters a blessing around? The best thing that's human! a sweet-tempered woman! But where is the thing to be found? 'Mongst the Ladies! &amp;c. (Repeat chorus.) Egl. Escaped! With baffled sport I'm fit to smother! Orson. What are you up to?âchevying my mother? Egl. That man! I call you âman,â observe, for courtesy! Orson. Thanksâoh, so much! I dont appear, though, hurt, see! This is my realm. Egl. I thought it was the King's. And, oh! why don't you put on proper things! Orson. (aside) Another, to my want of clothes, allusion! I feel I'm covered only with confusion! Are you aware that I am wild and rough, And utterly too dangerous? Egl. Oh! stuff! I want a glass of wineâyou take another! (She helps him Orson. (drinks) I ask again, why chevy my dear mother? Another glass!âmight win a heart of wood! She has been devilish kind, and (drinks) devilish good! So you're a girl? Egl. That any fool might see! Orson. (aside) Fool!âhas that distant reference to me!â (coming to her) Under what category me d'ye bring? (he is listening earnestly) Egl. Perhaps I best describe you as a âThing!â Orson. Yes! ex-Zacky-ly, my dear! Egl. Don't call me âdear!â Be off! Orson. I plainly see! I call you âdeerââyou make gazelle of me! Deer! while to win your smile I'm scarcely hoping! Mark, if with t'other chap you aren't elope-ing! Don't ye thinkâI'll have it out before we partâ The child of Nature hasn't any 'eart? Say something! my poor nerves is quickly ârose!â Egl. (coolly) Good day!âget measured for a suit of clothes! (Exit) Orson. It's palpable she takes me for a brute! She spurns my suit!âI mean my lack of suit! Clothes! in these rocks, undressed, I've been a fixture! My only costume, say, your Oxford mixture! Or go to Poole's? and brave this stormy weather! He is, I'm told a strong Poole altogether! I am a savage and I act as sich! Yet I the difference see 'twixt poor and rich. Song (Orson).âG. W. Hunter. There's lots of discussions on âcharity views,â And much we must fairly call âcant,â Why should earnest reflectors the poor men abuse, While the rich men are dying of want! The poor have the best of things of this life, So, why should the rich be despised? Perhaps my remarks may occasion some strife, If my feeling are not analysed! Then give to the poor when they're not in distress, Be it only a crust or a penny, Reflect that a swell wears a beard and moustache, While the poor working girl hasn't any! The poor go to Brighton each year for their health, The rich have to sorrow at home! For the poor have unlimited sources of wealth, And can spend it in Venice or Rome. The rich man his modest half-pint might obtainâ If the poor man his debts will but pay; But the poor man is living on grouse and champagne, And the rich man is starving on hay! Then, pray, give a thought to the weak or undressed, Be it only the half of a penny; Remember a Duchess may show two black eyes, While the sempstress's needle's not any! Chorus. Then give what you can to those who've too much, Tho' they fight like the cats of Kilkenny! Think! a Duke may despair of possessing an heir, While the poor working-man has too many! (Exit) Enter Valentine above. [Music Val. This is a Ravine!âand my steed's a spavin! Good business that! My! what a day we're avin'! So there's a pic-nic going on! Nice sight! For one who's âonâ for a tremendous fight! It isn't pleasant toâ(you'll own the truth!) Be made a meal of in the flour of youth! (Scream off) A scream! My nerves, now bear me through this toughly! Like Eglantine's, when she's been squeezed too roughly! Enter Eglantine and Orson. 'Tis she! (seizing Orson) Youâ (Eglantine falls into Valentine's arms) Orson. I'm a man, sir, and a brother! (furious) What did she mean by âchevyingâ my mother? I live midst toadstools in the clear, cool air! Egl. Toadstools! Val. One comfort is, you've mush room there! We in the Court experience worse ills! Egl. You live amongst blue bellsâwe 'mongst blue pills! Yet from your rustic draughts, my friend, deliver us! Orson. (tasting) It's river-water, and its eau-de-river-ous! Val. The Board of Works shall soon our health secure, âMaking assuranceââ Orson. Quite so!ââdoubly sewer!â Val. No! I'm afraid your state 'gainst ours don't âshow up!â On that point, friend, the sponge you had better throw up! Orson. (innocently) âSponge, what is sponge? If you'ld your strength compare, I'd âthrow a sponge upâ with you anywhere! Egl. If you should come across one, don't refuse it; Don't âthrow it upâ at all, but simply use it! Orson. Again! there's something lurks in that remark! I don't half like this lady and her sparkâ With rage I flame,âtheir chaff I don't admire! Tho' I can thrash her spark I can't defy her! Val. The simply savage is âplayed out!â Egl. Quite true! We've had a tattoo-ed nobleman like you! Val. Such exhibitious folk are not now âgone on!â You woundn't draw as much as your are drawn on! Orson. I see! upon my costume you'd refine, oh âA little less of skin, and more of Kino!â (Shakespeare). Are you to come, and over me to glory? Here? dash my wig! in my own Terry-Tory! Look here! and here! (hurls rocks, etc.) Val. (coolly) Well! now your wrath's assuaged! For the Aquarium you are engaged! (takes note) Egl. Excellent! Yes,âI'm so glad that he picked you! Val. (still writing) It's understood, friend, after I have licked you. The time of battle now approaches! Egl. Yes! You'll make mince-meat of himâin thatâwant of dress! Orson. I'll heap, proud beauty, all surprise, surprise on! Mince-meat! âwhat's one mince-meats' another mince-pies-'on!â Val. (quails) Ah! Egl. Tell me, love, what are you shrinking at! Val. I'm doneâif he comes armed with puns like that! Orson. I rather think I fetched my dandy nicely At two! Val. Tat-too! we fight at two, precisely! Trio. Egl. It almost seems a pity thus to squabble, row, and fight, When if youl'd calmly come to town, you'ld make a splendid sight! Val. The profits I should make on you I really cannot guess! Ors. And pray, my enterprising lad, where comes your great success? Val. Well! I'd first show you at the Aquarium! Ors. Say: We'd cage you up at the Zoo! Val. You'd knock 'em, I know, at the waxwork show Egl. And the Crystal Palace, too! Ors. Oh! it's all very well, but if you get squashed, When I give it you left and right! Val. I shall see, too, my friend, you are properly washed Every Saturday night. Ors. What right have you, fine sir, like wine, to draw me from the wood? You'ld make engagements? Can you make the said engagements good? Egl. As far as proper payment goesâwell, that I guarantee! Val. What are the terms, my simple savage, you expect from me? Ors. A Thousand for the Aquarium! Two Thousand for the Zoo! Val. If this is but scoff, the thing I'm off! Egl. I drop the business, too! Ors. Three thou' at Tussaud's, or the Palace I'll smash! Val. This is overwhelming quite! Ors. And I won't take cheques, I'll have it in cash, Every Saturday night! Enter Haufray. Hauf. Well! so far, all goes well for our new plot! Does Hugo mean us fair, or does he not? Valentine armed, the savage foe must thrash him! Disarmed, the savage foe will simply smash him! Then I shall soon regain my rank and power! I mean to reign! Reign!âyes, of that I'm shower! Song.âHaufray It's very nice, I can't deny To feel yourself in love, Although the party's station's highâ And yoursâwell, far above! I knew a village maiden once, In her's my heart was boundâ For daisies and for buttercups We roved the meads around. Chorus. Since then I've gone thro' many a strife, And so much wiser grown, And now look for a wealthy wife, Who's not far off a throne. The buttercups may fade for me, The daisies die, or worse! What I look to, is l s d, My aim to fill my purse! She don't touch my chin, But I often grin, When owning love's pretty fetter, At the girl I took up with the buttercup, And I think I'm doing better! Enter Henry. Henry. (hastily) I say, that beggar's coming! Hauf. Hugo? Henry. Yes! It's understood, of course, about the dress; Also the swordâtheâ Hauf. Call a spade a spade! The trick for which our creature's Hugo made! Why, what on earth in this scheme you're afraid for? Enter Hugo. Hugo. (touching himself) He calls a spade a spadeâthat's what he's paid for! When Valentine comes outâthen comes the rub! Orson will introduce him to his club! And 'gainst that club, what's 'art? Hauf. Just soâthat's true! Hugo. It's âon the cards,â all diamonds to you! You understand this somewhat hidden lingo? (They nod) (aside) Diamonds!âyah! this trick you'll rue, by Jingo! Up earl-y you must get my trust to hire! Diamonds!âoh, my very heart's a-fire! Hauf. You talk of jewels like a very Jew! Hugo. (humbly) Jewels!âoh, yes, I amethyst-ing you! (trumpet) Henry. The King returns! For what's to come, prepare! Hugo. There's one thing you have overlookedâthe bear! A dangerous second, that! Hauf. All right, don't chaff! (to Henry) Forgot the Bear!âmight have got off for half! (Music) Enter Pacolet, Blandiman, &amp;c. Hauf. What news? Pac. Escaped! The dogs a failure quite! Bland The Bear just âdoubled,â and was out of sight! Pac. The whole affair was one disgraceful rout! Bert. What odds? I didn't come to rush about! Rab. Nice sort of work a man like me to bring! Give us a glass of fizz, or anything! (Cheers) Hauf. The King! Bad manners, pray, put on the shelf! Pac. Oh, you shut up! He's awful âslue-d himself! Enter Pepin and Huntsmen, with Dogs. (Music) Pep. (assistants try to take his cloak off) Here, whip 'em off! We live a life, we Kings! Whip 'em off! Idiots! I don't mean my things! I've been bear-hunting; but, pray, be aware, There's not the least cause for my hunting bare! Give us a drink! my throat's with shouting sore! What is it, friend? Hugo. (presents cup) The mixture as before! Pep. It seems to sparkle, also fizz, and bubble some; Hugo. To be repeated when the cough is troublesome! Pep. (aside, pleased) This man must be advanced! Hauf. (to Henry) What means this shine? Pep. (to Hugo) You areâ? Hugo. The Valet to Sir Valentine! Pep. (laughing) Of course! the fight! (pats Hugo on back) Hauf. What's this?âthis is a new go! âLe Roi s'amuse!â Pep. He'll be the Victor, Hugo! Meanwhile, let's lark!âall trouble us annoys; Kick up a devil of a row, dear boys! (Sports; Ballet at end.âTrumpet) Hauf. Valentine! (to Hugo) Is all safe? Henry. For goodness sake, Don't let there be this time the least mistake! Hugo. (showing sword) It's right! Hauf. Hush! Henry. Mum! Pep. (very drunk) Ha, ha! that's devilish good! (Bear growls) I think we've âdrawn a whine, there, from the wood!â I shall resume the chase. I cannot see An inch before me. Follow, follow me! (Exeunt all) Enter Valentine and Eglantine. Val. It isn't very pleasant, is it it, my dear? But through the business I must go, that's clear! The Bear, too! Egl. Yes! I shudder at the roar! Val. âComing events,â dear, âcast their shudders before!â So Campbell says. Egl. How do you feel? Speak, plain! Your nerves will be so started by this strain! Why fight the thing?â Val. Don't rail! Egl. Oh! you'll be ruein' it You cannot look a motive up for doin' it! Val. I can! Egl. You can't! To beg you off I sue! What do you do it for? Val. What for?âFor you! Duo.ââRouge et Noir.â Valentine and Eglantine. Val. Tell me what I wouldn't do for you! Name, and I'll the danger seek! Egl. Yes! I quite believe that you are true, Only woman's nerves are always weak! Val. Do I not the foeman bravely dare? Egl. Certainly I grant you that! Val. Will not I with you my fortune share? Egl. Well! to that, I have an answer patâ I can only give you all my heart! Val. The answer that I crave. You are just perfectionâjokes apart! Egl. And you're so strong, so brave! Val. I can only say, since first we met I've loved youâman and boy! Egl. When in collarsâ(can I e'er forget? We shared each sweet and toy! Val. Tell me what I wouldn't do for you! Name and I'll the danger seek! Egl. Yes! I quite believe that you are true, Only woman's nerves are always weak! Val. Will you my poor lot contented share? Egl. Love! to that I answer âDone!â Val. Then for wedded bliss we will prepare When they weld the happy two in one! (Dance off) Enter Orson, with huge tree.âBear follows. Orson. Don't think, dear mother, I too much have dared; I don't feel happyâ(wields tree) but I feel prepared! (MusicâPageant) Enter Pepin. Courtiers, Haufray, Henry, all Characters (Guards excepted), Hugo at side, with shield set. Pep. We're up to time, I think! or something's in it! Hauf. You're punctual, as usual, to the minute! Egl. Oh! how my heart beats! What results 'twould bring If it could only beatâthat awful thing! Hugo. Don't be afraid! I'm on the spot, you know; (showing shield) Isn't it lovely? I have cleaned it so! You ought to like itâ Egl. (puzzled) Can't say just this minute! Hugo. You shouldâ'cos you can see yourself, dear, in it! (Trumpets.âCheers) Enter Valentine and Suite. Val. Thanks! But perhaps this cheering might be stopped Because it's possible I may be whopped! Egl. Absurd! Hauf. (aside to Henry) Not quite! Henry. I'm watching Hugo! Hauf. Good! Pep. (anxious) Oh, here's our undressed party from the wood! I say!âThis is a fight! No blooming âcross!â Val. Well! I mean business! Come, old man, you toss! Enter Bear, in crinoline. Pep. (searching) Where's my bad shilling?â Orson. (loudly) Hem! I am a stranger! And hitherto have not invited danger; But, I should like it fully put forth now, Mother and I are âready for a row!â Pep. (applauding) Ring! Ring! Hauf. (to Hugo aside) It's right? Hugo. Right as the rightest banks! Give us the money! Henry. (gives purse) We must âpart.â Hugo. (pocketing purse) Oh! thanks! Egl. (to Orson) Is that the weapon you to use intend? Val. I think I told you, âbar the Bear,â my friend! I can't fight both! Orson. You won't fight bear! You're right! I'm bare! and you are clothed in armour bright! Is that your pluck! Val. If question 'tis of bare, What do you think of this, then?âthere! and there! (Throws off armourâTableau) Orson. Well! since I've seen you in that sweet undress, I shouldn't like to harm you, I confess! Egl. He quails at pigeon into you! Go on! You shall not ride the high 'orse onâOrson! Pep. Time! Hauf. Now to work! Orson. Thus, then, my club I wield! Val. (draws swordâonly hilt) I this! (chord) Orson. (lifting tree) Then, victory! Hugo. (pushing shield forward) Not so! The shield! Orson. (sees himself) Myself! myself! in hideousness great! Civilization! and Electro-Plate! To art like this, I own I'm bound to yield! Hugo. (to Hauf) I've got your money, and I cleaned the shield! Give in? Orson. I do! I never knew before How very horrible a mug I bore! You're beautiful! Goody lessons preach me! And how to yellow soap useâbless you!âteach me! Egl. Then all stand by, and right go in with might! Bear. Hold! hang it all, don't let two brothers fight! Pep. Brothers! Hugo. What's this! a sort of spell seems broken! Bear. (drops on all fours) It's truth! Pep. (rising) It is! a miracle has spoken! Both in the forest lostâamongst the rocks! Val. I see it all! 'Tis he! Orson. 'Tis he! Val. Box!! Orson. Cox!! (Embraceâtableau) Pep. So, all well ends; the moral, though, I say! Egl. A moral in burlesque? Val. Why not, dear, pray? Of course, our object's trying to be funny, Orson. With just a sort of side-glance as to money! The moral's, though, apparent to the nation:â Brotherly Loveâ (holding Val's hand) Val. And blow the Education! FINALE. âHe's an old 'un.â To this harmless piece of nonsense there's an ending, No doubt you'll all be glad to get away; But we beg you say a little word befriending This wild farrago which we call a play! It's very well to pull down a construction, Which once has taken lots of time to build! But a kindly hand or two's an introduction Of joy to us, and helps to gild the pill! It's an old 'un, but it's a golden SayingââBe to others' failings charitable, good!â You will find we'll to you beholden, And we'll still be friends, of course, as ever we should!
