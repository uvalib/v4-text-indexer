      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scena prima Enter Marius a young Lord returnd from Travel, wt h him Rufinus &amp; Leontius noblemen. Ruf: You have made a large Relation, but more rare Of your experienc'd Travels, &amp; I fear You will depopulate [the] our Court, &amp; Land Of the most noble Youths, [wh] who being fird By your rich Benefit, will like Lightning fly To purchase Fame, &amp; Honour Leont: You're full fraught With many Kingdoms Virtues. Mar: Sr you flater now And do outprize my willing Industry: Yet without Boast, I've been no Drone, my Lords, To suck up others Labours; nor, as Many Of our Nobles do, purchasd new Fashions With the Loss of Lands; nor spent my five years Travels To bring home a Spanish Block, or a French Complement. A German Health, or English tilting Staff: Nor fidled out my Time in capering, yet these Nor any other active Exercises, That can be added to adorn the State Of a true Gentleman is strange to me Occasion best will witness. But, my Lords, I have not yet in the least Syllable Receiv'd the Knowledge of domestic Things. What change of state, of Friends, or Enemys The Custome of the Court; who are in Grace Least my long Absence hence May make me ignorant of due Respect Deservd by noble Merit; and who is Favourite To the KingâI woud be loath t'appear Ridiculous in any Errors at first Interview. Ruf: You have outstript the Wing of our Desires We did reserve it with a full Intent To make a just Return to your Relation. Mar: My Thoughts thirst for it. Ruf: You knew young Tullius: Mar: Servius Tullius Son. Ruf: The same. Mar: Pray on. Ruf. He was a Man you know of no great Birth. Leont: A Gentleman, that's all. Mar: A King's no more Ruf. He is the only Gallant of the Times The Courts chief School Master in Arts, &amp; Arms. The chief star that adorns this Hemisphere Is thrown into his Bosom for his Bride. Mar: Her Name Rufinus? Ruf: Tis beauteous Philadelph[i]a, the sole Daughter Of Marcellanus our chief Senator. Mar: A lovely Dame, Rome wants her Paralel. Except my Saint the bright cheekd LÃ¦lia. Ruf: The Solemn Graces, Hymeneal Sports And Revellings at this great Nuptial, Cannot by the Tongue of Wonder be compard. Millions were lavishd in excessive Sports, And pybald Pageantry. And then the open Favours Of the King, cround with the gaping Multitude, made Atlas shake with Laughter. Mar: When was this, my Lords? Ruf: some two days since The happy Bridegroom, has not yet I'm sure Pluckt th'HesperiaÂ«nÂ» Fruit; 'twas her Desire To lye three Nights alone, your Courtlike Way To make them feed the Freer when they meet. Mar: I curse my slow Speed That made mine Eye a stranger to these Sights Ruf: Rather adore that Deity, that detaind you. Mar: Do you then malign then his Happyness, Young Tullius Honours, &amp; my Soveraigns Grace. Ruf: Do we; who do's not, &amp; contemn them too, as Mar: I do you Or any that true Worth shal emulate. I know young Tullius is a noble Youth Endu'd with Virtues, &amp; Perfections Fitting to rank with our best Roman Blood. Ruf: Leont Ha! ha! ha! ha! Mar: Do you laugh? By all our Gods, Rufinus, Tullius Merits Deserve those Graces, are bestowd upon him; Better than any one that envys them. Ruf: How Marius.
