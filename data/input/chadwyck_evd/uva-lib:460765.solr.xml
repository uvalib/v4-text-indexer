A Beauty-full, Grace-full, and A-muse-ing Scene, In the course of which will be realised, in accordance with the present Taste for Tableaux, Several designs from the Antique, including one on Adonis—by Venus. A Fresco Groupe of the Muses, Graces, Love &amp; Hymen. “Even as the Sun with purple-coloured face, Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn; Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase, Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn.” —Shakespeare. Distant View of the City and Port of Paphos. An Enchanting Scene. “Tempus Fugit.” —Aldgate Clock. “O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.” —Shakespeare. An incantation à la (Pig's) Fry—schutz!!! With a bow wow Chorus by the Dogs of War. VIEW IN THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS. A ROMANTIC SCENE. Adonis killed by an A-boar-iginal inhabitant. “So in our Woods the hunted Boar On his native strength relies; The Forest echoes with his roar, In turn the Hunter flies.” —T. Dibdin. AN ASTRONOMICAL SCENE! Rising of a Brand New Moon, and Revolution of the principal Planets in this Hemisphere, on a Novel Starring System. OCCULTATION OF MARS, Visible only in the Olympic Theatre. Time of greatest Obscuration, Eveng., 10h. 50m. before or after, less or —Moore. Transit of Venus and apperance as the Evening Star! And Finale to the Music of the Spheres.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Paphian Bower—Temple, with statues of Venus and Cupid—in front an altar with hearts burning upon it—Hymen attending them, torch in hand, and occasionally tying two together, when the flames go out and he throws them into a gilt basket beside him, placing at the same time fresh ones upon the altar—several little Loves are assisting him—The Three Graces occupy the centre of the stage in a classical group, and Cupid is seen sharpening his arrows on a grindstone. Quintette—“Five times by the taper's light.” Hymen. Five times by my torch's ray I've tied up hearts in pairs to-day. Cupid. Where's mother? Hymen. She's gone out to roam. If she have luck She'll bring the buck To whom she's ta'en a fancy home. Hymen, Cupid, and Graces. Home! home! she'll soon come home, Swift to the woodland vale below, We saw her dart to bring her beau Home, home, home. Hymen. By Jupiter, I vow it's quite amazing To see how these fond hearts will keep on blazing Upon Love's altar—spite of wind and weather, Until I tie 'em up in pairs together, When 'stead of burning brighter thus united, Out they all go, and cannot be relighted. Cupid. Well, all I know is, that they've kindled fairly, Ought to burn well, and be extinguished rarely. To keep them nicely trimmed your care should be, So if they get blown out, don't blow up me. If you neglect them till they smoke and smother, You can't much wonder if they trim each other. (a ra ta ta tat without) Run to the door! (Exit a Love) Some Post from Greece or Rome. The Love returns. The nine Miss Muses. Will you be at home? Cupid. Always to them. Hymen. Oh, shew 'em up, of course. 1st. G. Have they all come upon their flying horse? Love. No, please your Grace, whene'er they visit us, They come in Cloud's blue-bodied omnibus. The man behind politely pulls the line, And says in accents soft, “Descend ye nine.” (Exit Love) 1st. G. The omnibus for ladies of their rank! 2nd. G. They run from Mount Parnassus to the Bank. Cupid. Run to the Bank! no, no, you silly wench, From Mount Parnassus they run to the Bench. Music—The Nine Muses enter as described. Cupid. Three times three welcomes to the tuneful nine. Clio, I vow you're looking quite divine! How Miss Euterpe does I need not ask; And gay Thalia smiles like her own mask. Melpomene, “with stately step and slow,” (music) Terpsichore “on light fantastic toe,” (music) Miss Polyhymnia, Muse of dulcet song, (music) And Erato, of numbers sweet and strong. Calliope, the eloquent and wise, And fair Urania, always in the skies! Last of the nine pins with that globe you wait, As ready to bowl down the other eight. Thal. (to Cupid) Your mother's not at home! but well, no doubt! Cupid. She'll be distressed you call'd while she was out. You come so seldom; while with some excuses, Cupid is always calling on the Muses. 1st. G. You'll some refreshment after your long ride take! 3rd G. A glass of cyprus. Hymen, cut some bride cake. Mel. No wine for us—pure water from the spring— Pierian, Heliconian—anything. Cupid. Pure water? pshaw! this choice liqueur, I'm sure, You can't object to—'tis Parfait amour. Thal. Oh, worse and worse! Wine gets into the head, But this would get into the heart instead. Adieu, my love—good morning to your Graces, We must make haste, or we shall lose our places. The omnibus comes by your Temple Bar. Cupid. You shall not go till you have seen mamma. She is expected every minute now. Ven. (singing without) Oh, where, and oh where is my hunting laddie gone? Thal. Hark! that's her voice! Venus appears in the distance. Mel. 'Tis Venus 'self, I vow! “But mercy on us! what has changed her eyes? The above lines, in inverted commas, should only be spoken when the lady playing Venus has, like the late Madame Vestris, dark eyes and hair. “They used to shame the azure of the skies, “And now they're hazel, and her locks of light, “Are dark as Erebus. Cupid. “You're very right; “But take no notice of it, for the truth is “That she enamoured of a silly youth is “Who slights her passion, and her grief and care “Have changed the colour of her eyes and hair; “So on this point I beg you don't attack her. “You'll only make her look a great deal blacker.” Ven. (advancing) Ah me! sad hours seem long! Mel. In Paphos' bowers, Prithee what sadness lengthens beauty's hours? Ven. The Muses here! I was about invoking Your potent aid! with grief you see me choking. The Queen of Love is baffled by a boy As beautiful as he, alas, is coy. Thal. Proceed. Ven. In speech or song? Clio. If Clio chooses, 'Twill be in song. All the Others. Oh, music for the Muses. Song—Venus—“Sally in our Alley.” Of all the swains that are so smart, I dearly love Adonis; And pit-a-pat will go my heart, Till he bone of my bone is. No buckskin'd beau of Melton Mow- bray rides so capitally. Oh, he's the darling of my heart, And he hunts in our valley! Jupiter and the neighbours all Make game of me and Dony; But notwithstanding I with him Contemplate matrimony. For he can play on the cornet, And sing most musically; And not a Duke in all the land Can beat him at “Aunt Sally.” Thal. We were about to go, but we'll remain, If we can help you to subdue your swain. A lad so fond of horses can't refuse An invitation coming from a muse. Send for him in my name. Ven. He'll not be won! Mel. If Dian, then, would cause the game to run This way—he would, of course, be sure to follow! (to Cupid) Fly, Love, and ask—you'll find her in the hollow. Ven. I fear 'tis all in vain. His heart I've tried. (Exit Cupid) Hunting he loves; but love he can't abide. Glee—Venus, &amp;c.—“Even as the Sun.” Soon as the sun has changed his dappled greys, For those bright bloods he drives till eventide, Rose-cheeked Adonis rises with his rays. Hunting he loves; but love he can't abide. Re-enter Cupid. Cupid. Well, Dian's done it! yonder goes the stag, And after him Adonis on his nag; And now she makes it throw him! Ven. Oh, he's hurt! Cupid. No, only had a tumble in the dirt. Hymen. He's up again, but cannot catch his horse, And so has taken to his legs perforce. Ven. He comes! Ad. (without) Yoicks! yoicks! tantivy! hark away! Ven. “How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues” by day. Enter Adonis. Ad. Thrown off and out! confound that jade, I say. Why, where the dickens have I got to, eh? Here's a whole pack of jades! 'ware women! zounds! If they give tongue, the deuce can't hear the hounds. Ven. Turn, gentle hunter! turn and rest thee here. Dost thou not know me? I am thine own dear. Ad. I wish you were, for then you'd be a shy one. 'Tis the first time I e'er was hunted by one. Ven. Can you not learn to love? Ad. No, I'm too stupid. Ven. Take but one lesson from Professor Cupid. This is my son, sir. Ad. What, that little jockey! Is he the gentleman who plays at hockey With people's hearts? Cupid. Have you got one to play with? Ad. Yes, but not one that you shall ride away with. Ven. Will you not listen to the three fair Graces? Ad. Take off the G, and make them three fair races? Ven. Give the nine Muses, then, a patient hearing. Ad. That's three times three, yet anything but cheering. Chorus—Muses—“Robert le Diable.” The tuneful nine, unless thy heart be marble, Will not in vain their blended powers essay. With airs divine from Robert le Diable, 'Tis hard indeed, if they don't win the day. The tuneful nine with airs divine, Will win the day, we're bold to say, &amp;c. Solo—Venus—(From the same) Quit the chase, my dear Adonis, Cut the turf and kennel clean, Sell your hunters, racers, ponies, Burn your Sporting Magazine. Broken hearts we hear of, But we seldom see the wrecks. There is much more fear of Broken arms or necks. Quit the chase, &amp;c. Why at clubs with legs be betting, When the course to hearts is clear? Why cleaned out at dice be getting, When a paradise is here? Here's the game, all fair, sir; And if other fare you love, From all the bell we bear, sir, For real turtle-dove. Quit the chase, &amp;c. Ven. Nay, sweet Adonis, if the Muses tease you, Love will take ev'ry step on earth to please you Ballet—Cupid and Others. Ad. Madam, I tell you plainly as I can, It's of no use. I'm not a marrying man. Besides, fair lady, I've a strange misgiving That you have got a lawful husband living. And as a friend of mine says, “Dash the wig o' me,” Jove may indict us both, you know, for bigamy. Ven. If you mean Vulcan, on my reputation, There is a proper deed of separation. The learned Proctors all, sir, did agree A lame old tinker was no match for me; And if it had been with a goddess regal, The marriage of the blacksmith was not legal. Ad. But don't there run some story 'mongst the stars Of a flirtation with a chap named Mars? Ven. Oh, that's a very, very old affair. I've cut the fellow a long time, I swear. Enter Love, announcing. Love. Field-Marshal Mars! Enter Mars. Ad. Heyday! what next, I wonder? Mars. Guns, trumpets, blunderbusses, drums, and thunder! A traitor in the camp! Ven. I'm all confusion! Cupid. Provoking! Ad. Here's a burst! Ven. Why this intrusion? To my boudoir who granted you admission? Mars. This, ma'am, to me? gunpowder and perdition! Sir (to Adonis), do you come here as this lady's wooer? Ad. Not I, i'faith! I've nothing to say to her. But if you've anything to say to me There is my card. Mars. 'Tis well, sir! we shall see! Thal. Dear gentlemen, I hope you'll go no further! Oh, mercy on us, ladies! here'll be murther! Mel. Murder! I hope there will, with all my heart. 'Tis long since tragedy has had a start! Ad (to Mars) With sword or pistol? Mars. Swords my weapons are. Mars is a planet, not a shooting star. Ad. Plan it which way you please, for you can't beat me At either. Mars. That, sir's, to be tried, so meet me. Duet—Mars and Adonis—“Meet me by moonlight.” Mars. Meet me by moonlight alone, At half after nine without fail. You know, sir, where stands the mile-stone In the grove at the end of the vale! You must promise to come, for I've said, And to keep my word strictly I mean. I'll leave you of all bodies dead— The deadest that ever was seen. So meet me by moonlight alone! Yes, meet me by moonlight alone! Ad. I'll! meet you by night or by day, But if you'll just take a friend's hint, The doctor should be in the way With tourniquet, bandage, and lint. Remember, be sure to be there, For though little the lady I prize, Some credit 'twill be, I declare, To cut out a star from the skies. So meet me by moonlight alone! Yes, meet me by moonlight alone! Ven. This mustn't be! harness my team of sparrows; I will to Bow Street, swift as Cupid's arrows. Give information—call out the police, And bind them over both to keep the peace. Concerted Piece—“Mosé in Egitto.” Venus, Muses and Graces, Hymen, &amp;c. Murder! Here's a fine to-do—fine to-do! Let us all fly the city to—city to. Cupid. To spoil sport 'tis a pity too—pity too; A duel looks so well next day in printers' ink. Mars., Ad. Yes, indeed, here's a fine to-do—fine to-do. Who d'ye think, sir's, afraid of you—'fraid of you? Mince meat soon shall be made of you—made of you. You're a nice man—you're a nice man, I don't think. Ven. How can you be two such geese—two such geese? Of your lives have you got a lease—got a lease? Or, like cats, have you nine apiece—nine apiece? That thus to gain éclat from risking one you think! Murder, here's a fine to-do, &amp;c. Yes, indeed, here's a fine to-do, &amp;c. Confusion—closed in by</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quintette—“Five times by the taper's light.” Hymen. Five times by my torch's ray I've tied up hearts in pairs to-day. Cupid. Where's mother? Hymen. She's gone out to roam. If she have luck She'll bring the buck To whom she's ta'en a fancy home. Hymen, Cupid, and Graces. Home! home! she'll soon come home, Swift to the woodland vale below, We saw her dart to bring her beau Home, home, home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —Distant view of the city of Paphos. Enter Mars, meeting Esculapius. Mars. Great Esculapius—renowned M.D.; You are the very friend I wished to see. Escula. Hah! you look flushed—a little fever there. Permit me—(feeling his pulse) In a gallop, I declare; Put out your tongue. Mars. Pshaw! hold yours while I speak. Escula. Talking fatigues, and we seem rather weak; We'd better go to bed and take some gruel. Mars. Take notice, you, I go to fight a duel. Escula. Alarming symptoms! caused by deadly drugs. The mixture—patent gunpowder and slugs. One pill a dose—ta'en early in the morning: Patient popped off without a moment's warning. Sad work for doctors. Mars. Can't help that, but note— Shoot him I sha'n't, I mean to cut his throat. Escula. Steel med'cines! worse and worse. Mars. Tortures infernal He's made me feel! Escula. Some injury internal. What's the complaint? Mars. Flirting before my face With Venus. Escula. Yellow jaundice! common case— Must lose a little blood, an ounce or two, From the sword arm. Mars. I'll run the rascal through The midriff! Escula. And my fee! If life be spilt, How do you think my beard's to be kept gilt? S'death, do you take me for an undertaker Or that I live by “dead men,” like a baker? A flesh wound if you please, or slight contusion, But kill a man outright—fits and confusion! Sir! 'tis a most unprincipled aggression, 'Tis interfering, sir, with our profession! Mars. Time's flying fast! do you decide to go? Escula. (looking out) 'Gad, he'll be past before I really know; I'll catch Time by the forelock! Enter Saturn, who is seized by Esculapius accordingly. Saturn. Come! let go, man! Escula. Stay! Saturn. Never! time and tide can stay for no man! Escula. But I am tied to time—no inflammation! We doctors must take time for consultation! Besides, my dad, Apollo the musician, Taught me to keep time, and with great precision. Ay, and to beat time! So, old Edax rerum, As I've some things to say, you stop and hear 'em. Saturn. Well then! make haste, my sand must run mean time. (turns his glass) Escula. (aside to him) Mars is about to meet a rival—I'm Desired to be in waiting! I object, On principle, and ask Time to reflect! Saturn. (aside) I have reflected! while he strives to find Time, To fight his duel in—keep him behind Time. And I will fly so fast, that e'er he's warning, Time will be past, and bring to-morrow morning. Escula. Sharp as a lancet! now I've got him, there! (seizes Mars) Saturn. Fair play's a jewel, then—let go my hair! (Esculapius lets Time go) Mars. Why, s'death! you're losing Time! quick backward haul him! (Saturn flies away) Escula. He's flown! and Jove himself could not recall him! (the scene darkens, and is lighted again directly) Mars. Distraction! Time has slipped with night away. And in the east there dawns another day! I shall be posted for a coward! zounds! They'll say that war has got afraid of wounds! And that false hussey, Venus, too! O scandal Will make of this affair a precious handle! Escula. Scandal! pho! on insanity you border, To mind a slight attack of that disorder. Here's Mirth and Mercury, they'll bear me out. Enter Momus and Mercury. 'Tis an endemic going much about. Unpleasant! but with common prudence treated, The virulence is very soon defeated. Glee—Esculapius, Momus, and Mercury—“Dame Durden.” Olympus has a crowd of gods, And each has his female; And I'll bet you, my friend, long odds, There runs of each some tale. There's Pol kissed Clio, And Jove kissed Io, As proved by the peacock's tail; For Argus found his hundred eyes 'gainst love would naught avail. Dame Juno curls her haughty lip, And dares at others rail; And Dian at the slightest slip, Pretends her face to veil. Yet Pan kissed Dian, And Juno Ixion, At least so runs the tale. And they are pretty folk, alas! To call their neighbours frail! Then isn't he a stupid ass, Who turns at scandal pale. (Exeunt Esculapius, Momus, and Mercury) Mars. O, Time, I let you 'scape me in an ill time. Tell me, ye gods! what shall I do to kill time? I know! I'll rouse a boar—a bristly, bony, And brawney savage—who shall kill young Dony. By proxy my revenge shall now be taken, I'll conjure up a boar, like Friar Bacon! (Melo-dramatic music) Goddess of vengeance! wheresoe'er thou art, Fierce Até, rise, and take a forte part, In my malicious glee; thy serpents don— Put the high pressure of thine engine on, Esteemed goddess! Mars will be thy stoker, And stir thy fires, with his steely poker. No safety valve shall save Adonis now, The boiler of thy wrath shall burst and blow The minion into pieces! speed from far, Cry havoc, and let slip the hogs of war. Enter Até and Furies; a Boar rushes out of the thicket. Mars. Thou beast, who be'est a ranger of the wood, And relishes a slice of man for food, Sharpen thine ivories—do my bidding right, And I'll indulge thy beastly appetite. This day thou wilt encounter in a broil, A youth who seeks thy beauty, beast, to spoil; Be bold as brass, and let him feel thy mettle, Or to thy tail he'll surely tie a kettle. He's rash, be rasher—we will egg him on, And 'twixt two fires, doubtless he'll be done! Now tramp away, I will not see thee pause, Till he become a sandwich 'twixt thy jaws. Exeunt Mars, Até, and Furies, driving the Boar before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Three. —Romantic view in the Island of Cyprus. Adonis discovered pacing the stage. Ad. Day breaks! and finds me looking like an ass; I've watched all night, with my couteau de chasse. And no antagonist! my temper's soured, Whate'er his rank—I say he's a rank coward! At the Horse Guards, and every club I'll post him, In type that all who run may read and roast him. In black and white it shall by all be seen, He feared being pinked and left upon the green. The plain unvarnished tale abroad shall spread, And Mars look blue, whenever that is read. I've waited long enough! be his the shame! Here come the hunt! so hey for other game. Enter Hunters. Chorus—“Foresters sound the cheerful horn.” Somebody sound the cheerful horn For nobody here can play; And some old buck, as sure as he's born, Shall kick the bucket to-day. At length when jaded home we come, We'll moisten well our clay With whiskey, brandy, gin, and rum, And backy puff-away, away, away! &amp;c. (Exeunt Adonis and Hunters) Music—“By the simplicity of Venus's doves”—to which Venus and Cupid descend in a car drawn by turtle doves. Ven. This way we hear the horns! am I too late, To warn my dear Adonis of his fate? Cupid. I wonder, ma, you plague yourself about, So boorish and insensible a lout. The Queen of Beauty, thus to hanker after, A bumpkin full of dog talk and horse laughter. Ven. How can you wonder, who have willed it so? The more he flies me—I the fonder grow! Find him I must, and bid him Mars beware! There's something brewing—but it's not a bear. A strange presentiment my soul comes o'er, If aught kill him, 'twill be a horrid bore! Go when I tell you, sir! drive back my car, You'll find good stabling, yonder at “The Star.” Let the doves have a peck of peas, when cool, And don't you with the bar-maid play the fool, As you're too apt to do—you wicked elf! Cupid. But mayn't I order something for myself? I'm hungry too. Ven. At such a time as this is? Well, your old luncheon, bread and cheese and kisses. Exit Cupid with car; horns heard without. That strain again! they wind those horns about, So plaguily—the deuce can't find 'em out; Song—Venus—“Kelvin Grove.” Where the dickens hast thou flown, Dear Adonis, O. It amazes me, I own,—Dear Adonis, O. That so coolly forth you'd ride, When with me you might abide, By Love's cosy fire-side,—Dear Adonis, O. Sure as death, and quarter day,—Cold Adonis, O. You'll be brought to book or bay, Sad Adonis, O. Must the Queen of Beauty bawl? And you take no heed at all! For her pride, oh, what a fall,—Rude Adonis, O. For her pride, oh, what a fall,—Rude Adonis, O. But the Time is come for you,—Mad Adonis, O. To have a tumble too,—Bad Adonis, O. I'd a shocking dream last night, You were fishing by moonlight, And wild boar alone would bite,—Sad Adonis, O. I see the danger nigh,—Dear Adonis, O. I've a stye in my mind's eye,—Dear Adonis, O. Stretch'd already you appear On your intermediate bier, And the porters drop it here,—Dead Adonis, O. And the porters drop it here,—Dead Adonis, O. (Exit Venus) Music—Enter Adonis, pursuing the Wild Boar. Ad. Aha, my boy! no thoroughfare that way! I have you now! Oh, what you'll stand at bay? With all my heart. Nay, think not I'm in joke, Long as I find you pig, you'll find me poke! Song—Adonis—“Cease, rude Boreas.” Cease, wild boar, thou blustering railer, List with thy pig's ear to me; Quickly here, thou fell assailer, Thou shalt be assailed by me; Though thy bristles in commotion, Like a row of bayonets rise, Vain thy threats, for I've a notion Pork is excellent in pies. Enter Mars—Melo-dramatic music—Adonis attacks the Boar, who, goaded by Mars, succeeds in wounding Adonis, who falls—Exeunt Mars and Boar. Ad. I'm dish'd by jingo! In at my own death After a hard run—rather out of breath. Dear brother bucks, in my last will you'll find, As in the chase, I've left you all—behind. Enter Venus, Cupid and the Graces. Ven. That voice! O mischief! thou art quick a-breeding! Adonis dies! the flow'r of love lies bleeding! Go bring a surgeon, and if one won't do, Another must be found to bring him to. Let night in general mourning put the skies, And bid the moon and all the planets rise, And set on Mars who set upon my dear The beastly boar that over bore him here! And through the brute's own nose go put a ring, And drag him hither, Love, by thy bowstring. Air—Venus—“Thy Father! away!” Fly farther away, and bring back the vile boar Who has wounded Adonis, the youth I adore. Let Dian the traitor to punishment bring, For coming to go for to do such a thing. Away, &amp;c., Clouds begin to fill the scene—Exeunt Cupid; Graces, separately. Ad. You're very kind, but spare yourself the trouble; I've often had a squeak for life's vain bubble. And now 'tis burst—my final leap is taken; It's quite impossible to save my bacon. I'm run to earth, and must bid you good-bye; So prithee don't continue in full cry. Shake hands, and let's part friends—'twill soon be over; I'm going fast as I can go to cover. Quintette—“Mild as the moonbeams”—Venus, Adonis and the Graces, who return. To range the Elysian fields Adonis hies. O Dian, hear! Fair huntress of the skies! Mildly her moonbeams through the dark clouds tremble. Come, Queen of Night, and aid the Queen of Love. The moon as a crescent, with Diana seated in it, rises through the clouds, which clear off. Ven. Diana! Luna! Proserpine! which e'er Of thy three names thou likest best to bear— Hear, goddess of the silver bow, my call, Thou lady patroness of earth's gay ball; Queen of the planets, empress of the stars, Venus invokes your vengeance upon Mars. He's killed the youth to whom we both were partial. Oh, break the bâton of this fierce field-marshal, Say a court martial called on Mars shall be, Or plunge him, Dian, in the marshalsea. Dian. Alack, fair dame, no influence have I In any court save that of Chancery. There lunacy's the ward of law, you know, And many not quite mad are driven so. Ven. Assist me, then, for grief has made me frantic. Thou art the friend of lovers. Dian. How romantic! Well, then, to moderate your grief profound, Apply this lunar caustic to the wound. 'Twill burn his body up, but has the power To make him fitter still for beauty's bower. The fields he hunted he shall still adorn— Still shoot—“A native to the Manor born.” Still shall he drink the morning's healthful dew, Still shall he blow, though not a bugle, through. Still shall he scent the gale, for he shall be The wind flower, alias anemone. Adonis sinks and an anemone gradually rises in his place. Ven. He's gone off in a puff! Is it a joke? And will it end as it began—in smoke? Ah no! behold sweet incense round it throwing. He rises all a-growing—all a-blowing. Sweet bud, from scorching sun and wintry shower I'll shield thee. Adonis's face appears in the centre of the flower. Ad. That's the time of day, my flower. Music—Mars appears as a planet in the sky. Ven. See where Mars sheds his angry rays! Resist 'em! Dian. He's the most baneful planet in our system. Unless by Sol's consent some comet whips him, The most that I can do is to eclipse him. (Music—Moves, and her shadow eclipses Mars) Mars. Hollo! you've snuffed me out! Zounds, ma'am, be civil. I wish you'd mind what you're about. The devil Is in the moon for mischief, sure. She fidgets About the sky, and with her dirty digits Blackens one's face. Oh, Francis Moore, Physician, How long must I remain in this condition? Ven. (to Diana) Is not the boar within your jurisdiction? Cupid entering. Cupid. He's here in custody and sore affliction. Dian. Let him be killed and cured—we are not joking him. Off with his head—so much for poking him. (Exit Cupid) Ven. (to Audience) To shine as evening star 'tis now my hour; But ere again I seek my Paphian Bower, May I—oh, may I hope you'll bid it bloom? You who alone can really chase my gloom! Though metamorphoses I've here a few, I never wish to metamorphose you! My humble spells are only thrown around you To keep you the kind friends I ever found you. Surely the simple flower that opes to-night, This genial atmosphere will never blight; Nor will my poor new moon to wane be told, Before she is at least a few days old. Let Hymen join your hands—they have the power To bless my Stars, and save my Paphian Bower. Then be not, by malignant Mars, deluded, But ratify the piece we've here concluded. Music—The Boar is brought in, in procession, by Cupid, &amp;c., forming the picture by Westall—Venus, in the meantime, passes behind the clouds and appears as the Evening Star. Finale—“My delight on a shiny night, in the season of the year.” Ad. Oh, once I was a hunter, And chased both hare and deer, But by an ugly grunter, Cut short was my career; And now I am a flower, I hope to blossom here, And nightly grow in your favour thro' The season of the year. Dian. I hope I'm not encroaching, Nor speaking out of place, I do object to poaching, As Goddess of the Chase; But as the moon, I wink at it, As sometimes doth appear; And my delight is a shiny night, With shining phases here. Enter Saturn, hastily. Saturn. Since there is time for all things, Some time to Time allow. My time is come to tremble, Though pastime 'twas till now; Oh, spare then time to revel For some time longer here, And make the piece we're winding up A time-piece for the year. (originally) And if the Times reporter Should happen to be here, We hope he'll write that our piece to-night Is a time-piece for the year. Ven. By some we're charged with poaching, But I deny the same, For here we have a licence To sell Olympic game. Then, friends and patrons, favour us With a merry Christmas cheer, And I wish you all the compliments Of the season of the year. (at other periods) Then friends, and patrons, favour us With a good old English cheer; And to our delight let us every night Of the Season see you here! CURTAIN.</field>
