      <field name="fulltext">Actus I. ScÅna I. Enter King, Queen, and Oxford. King. They will not come? Ox. They will not. King. They bad been betterâ What was their answer? Ox. Thus said Fitzwater, father of the faction, That was Generall for the Barrons against your Majestie: Tell John, Ki. John! Ox. That was his Epithite; (Alledging how you stood at Rome, put from Your Kingly office.) Tell John, quoth he, (and frown'd) That here at Baynards Castle, we intend A settled stay for private reformations Of conceiv'd injuries, which by the peace The King made with us, were not throughly search'd, But like green wounds, clos'd with too swift a salve, (Upon your private ends) are with more danger Doubts and distracted difficulties again Broke forth; but having drawn them to a head, They would send them to you to be ratified, And then give their attendance. King. This is brave; Who was there else? Ox. Richmond, imperious Leister, and old Bruce. (The second in this revolt,) who sent the same return. K. A nest of Rebels; to try the truth of these fine florishes, You with Lord Mowbray, post unto Guilford, And being there, (pretending a visite unto Bruces Lady,) Wind into observation of the Castle; so from her, (The engine upon which these factions move,) Discover the intent of their disignes. Queen. Sure sir, the Lady is noble; but your Majesties Injunction shall be obey'd. Exit. Enter Chester, K. This not onely advantages Our meeting with Fitzwaters Daughter, (O how the thought startles my blood) But likewise furthers our resolv'd proceedings: Chester the news? Chest. Conceal your selfe sir, I have trapt her with a snare. K. Agen, then I shall see herâ Exit. Enter Matilda. Ma. You told me Chester, That the Queen did earnestly request my attendance: You said she was here i'th Garden, But it seems you were mis-inform'd. Ches. Excellent innocence how art thou trapt! I must attend the King; please you walk Madam But towards the Grove, I was told the Queen and Ladies Retyred there for shade. Mat. I shall. Ches. And I must vanish Exit Chest. Ent. King. Mat. Oh heaven, the King! K. Thy friend. Mat. False Chester! K. Fair Matilda, Mistresse of youth and beauty, sweet as a spring, And comely as the holy shining Priest Deckt in his glorious sacerdotall vestment; Yet heare the passions of a love sick Prince, And crown thy too too cruell heart with pitty. Mat. Yet let fall your too too passionate pleadings, And crown your royall heart with excellent reason. K. Hear me. Mat. The Queen will heare you. K. Speak but a word thatâ Mat. What? K. That may sound like something, That may but busie my strong labouring heart, With hope that thou wilt grant, and every morning I will walk forth and watch the early Lark, And at her sweetest note I will protest, Matilda spake a word was like that note. Mat. Oh how you tempt: remember pray your vows To my betroth'd Earl Robert Huntington; Did you not wish just as the poyson toucht His manly heart, if ever you again Laid battery to the fair fort of my unvanquish'd Vertue, your death might be like his untimely, And be poyson'd. Oh take heed sir, Saints stand upon heavens silver battlements, When Kings make vows, and lay their Listening ears to Princes Protestations. K. So did Matilda swear to live and die a maid, At which fair Nature like a Snail shrunck back, As loath to hear from one so fair, so foul A wound: my vow was vain, made without Recollection of my reason; and yours, Oh madnesse! Maids have sure forsworne such vowes: For Huntington, he like a heap of summers Dust into his Grave is swept; and bad vows Still are better broke then kept. Mat. Alas great sir, your Queen you cannot make me; What is it then instructs your tongue? Oh sir! In things not right, Lust is but loves well languag'd hypocrite. K. Words shall convert to deeds then; I am the King. Mat. Doe but touch me, And as I graspe steel in my trembling hand, Offers violence, she drawes a knife. So sure the King shall see Matilda fall A sacrifice to vertue. K. Cruell Maid, Crueller then the Kid that eanes her young On the rough bosome of a ragged flint: Go get thee to the woods, for thou art wild As flame, or winter; where so e're thou walk'st May wild winds chide thee, and the reeling Trees Like a confus'd fall of many waters Rail on thy rudeness, may the birds that build Among the wanton branches, stead of teaching Notes to their young, sing something like thy niceness: And lastly, may the Brooks when thou shalt lie And cast a pair of cruell busie eyes Upon their subtill slydings, may the water, The troubled image of my passions war With the stones, the matter of thy heart, that thou maist learn Thy hardnesse and my sufferings to discern; And so whilst I (if it be possible) study to forget you, May beasts, and bird, and brooks, and trees, and wind, Hear me, and call Matilda too unkind. Exit. Mat. Ile unto Baynards Castle to my father, Oh she had a violent need of Castles, where a King Layes such violent seige; but Oh truth, Thou art (whilst tenant in a noble brest,) A crown of Christall in an Ivory chest. Exit. Enter King and Chester. K. Shall I be dazled with effeminate darings? Ches. With a womans ward, a knife too. K. Here I left her. Ch. But here she is not now sir. K. Oh Chester run, run as thou lov'st my peace, Feather thy feet with lovers wishes, let but my desires Dwel in thy eyes, thou'lt find her, were she compast With a Cimerian mist. Ch. I will do my best sir. Exit. K. Thy best; do every thing, do any thing, Do all things that may find her; whether Love Leads thy dark Labyrinth; cannot Kings be free From thy impetuous buffets? I have desir'd A heardned heart, obdurate to thy shafts, And some times am so, when in the very minute Calling to mind Matilda's tears, like drops Continued upon marble, they pierce through, And I am soft again. Hast found her? Ent. Chester Ch. No sir, she is by this in Baynards Castle, Where her Father and the Lordsâ K. Command our Barge, wee'l after her like lightning: We must have pledges Chester for their faiths; if they refuse, Thunder shall meet with thunder, and each eye Shall see strange Comets in this troubled skie. Exeunt. Enter Fitzwater, old Bruise, young Bruise, Richmond and Leister, as in Baynards Castle. Fitz. My noble Lords, and honourable friends, Not to particularlize (what need plain dealing Be apparelled in particulars?) to a short supper, Or a poor pittance rather, ye are all Heartily welcome, very heartily, I must tell truth still. O Br. Brother we thank you. Eitz. I would we had my sister your wife, at Guilford with us. Rich. Where are the Ladies? Leis. Comforting Matilda, sad return'd from Court. Y. Bru. Betraid by Chester, and again escap'd Like a chaste Dove out of the fowlers Net, The lustfull King. Fitz. Oh John, John, wilt thou never Leave thy wags tricks? but let it passe, tis best Because indeed tis past. Leis. I wonder how he receiv'd our resolv'd answer. Y Bru. No matter how, he's like to have no other; Now by my blood, you vext my very soul That you sent any. O. Bru. Sonne, have a tamer spirit. Y Bru. Yes, and like horses, Be held by'th nose by frivilous respect, Whilst he casts Copperis into our sores, and searches Past honours patience. Fitz. Nephew, Nephew, hear me, Lets bear a little; faith he is the King, And though at Rome he does stand interdicted, Yet now and then takes a good start or two Towards regularity, till the fit comes on him; And for your neat horse simile observe me, Richmond and you are young men, we three old, But not too old to tell truth; the horse that will not Stard till and endure searching, how e're in summer With warmth and pasture, he may strike at flies, And play the wanton in a wealthy meadow, For all his summer pastime, yet tis said, Winter will leave him but a lean scal'd jade; Come, come, y'ar fooles, y'ar fooles. Leis. Well let usâbear then. Y Bru. Let us? Oh my blood! Besides, our injuries in his breach of promise, He made by stains and publique grievances, How in the flames of his adulterate heart Pursues he my chaste Cousin, by flights gets her Within his tallon, and but this afternoon, (Had not her friendly knife enfranchis'd her) Even in the face of heaven, in his own Garden He would have ravish'd her. O. Bru. Bro her, we are bound in honour not to bear it. Leis. Let him know our griefs, and ifâ Fitz. Well, well, with ifs and ands Mad men leave Rocks, and leap into the Sands; But something shall be thought on. Ent. Richmond. Rich. The King attended Onely with the Earle of Chester, Oxford, and some Other Gentlement, is new landed on the Stairs. Om. The King! Y Bru. Shut the stairs Gate. Fitz. Twere better Gate and stairs Were floating through bridg; we are safe my cholerick cousin, As in a Sanctuary; tis enough (A man would think,) to see a great Prince thus, Cause wee'd not go to him, to come to us, Ent. King, Oxford, Chester. and other Lords. Indeed, indeed, you speak unkindly. K. Behold great Lords, The Cedars of the Kingdome, how the King (A shrub) shrincks out of majestie, And comes to you; here's a fine Conventicle, Are ye blowing up new sires? and must Fitzwaters (Plain-breasted as his unaffected habite,) Be Generall again, again be call'd The Marshall of Heavens Army and the Churches? Are you Planet struck! you cannot talke. Fitz. Your pardon sir, I led the Barrons, but twas when they could not choose But choose a leader, and then me they chose; And why so think ye? they all lov'd your Grace, And grieve, grieve very heartily, I tell you, To see you by some state mice so misled: This state mice that nibble so upon the Lands impaired freedom That would not so play in the Lyons eare, But that by tickling him themselves to advantage; This troubl'd us, and greiv'd the body Politique, And this we sought to mend; I tell truth John, I, We are thy friends John, and if ye take from friendship The liberty of modest admonition, Ye leave no mark whereby to distinguish it From the fawning passion of a Dog-base flattery; If I speak plain, this truth be my defence, A good mans comfort is his Conscience: And so much for plain Robin. K. Fitzwater, Bruce, Richmond, and stubborn Leister, This is the last of our admonitions, Either lay by those Arms, those lawlesse arms, Which you have listed 'gainst your Lord the King, And give such pledges as we shall accept For settling of your loyalties, or here By the abused sufferings of a King, And by the unkind scars with which you have Deform'd the face of England; misery Shall over take you in a shape shall fright The Iron heart of faction, and the King Shall come no more acquainted with compassion, But call the bloodiest ends a righteous vengeance. Leis. I will not leave mine arms, Nor break my word to you; Unlesse provok'd, and justly; you have my faith, If you mislike that pledgeâ K. We do. Leis. And I reply that I can spare no nother. Ches. D'ee hear sir? O Bru. Already we have pawn'd the now scorn'd gage Of our afflicted honours, which refus'd Flies back again, and so we stand discharg'd. Fitz. King John, King John, Perform but the seal'd Covenants you are fled from, The Charter running thus, given by our hand The seventeenth day of June, and in the year 215 (the whole Realm being sworn to't,) And six and twenty Peers and Barrons sworn To the execution (who if you fail) are perjur'd Do this, and like a plat of Osier wands We shall bow any way, and you shall work us Into what fashion you shall fancy; but if you be melancholly, love-sick John, Or Lyon, unyoak'd Heifer, head-strong John, (As in the matter of the Losse of Normandie, When Anjou, Brittain, Main, Poictou, and Turwin, Were deliver'd up to Philip) you'l find your friends Not facile Willowes, but abrupt brambles, Whose intricate irregularity Whilst you shall go about to rectifie, They'l prick your fingers, and with unkind scratches, Expose you to a late deplor'd experience: Come, come, know this, when love in our side sings, The unkindest wounds are those we take from Kings; I am plain Robin. K. A down right Rebell. Fitz. Rebell! K. So are ye all. Om. Rebells! K. Traytors. Om. Traytors! K. Rebels and Traytors; Chester, Oxford, Gentlemen, Stand on your guards, there's danger in the room. O. Bru. You ate too passionate, perform with us, You shall walk over us, if not, we stand Our injur'd Countries Justicers. K. Proud boaster. This night shall raise a storme: Brav'd? with you Bruce aside We will begin; and yet he is the Brother Unto Matilda's Father, but his insolence, Oh love; a little while let revenge raigne, This night shall beget passages shall prove Your King a Lyon (vext) as (pleas'd) a Dove. Exit Ox. Lights for the King, there Gentlemen. Kings party. Y. Bru. What will you do? a tempest curl'd his forehead Into the fashion of an angry Ocean, Made wild with winds. Rich. We must resolve on something. Ol. Bru. And suddenly, for in his executions He is swift as lightning, ayr is not more light. Leis. Pandulph the Popes stern Legate, 'tis divulg'd, Is againe come over from the Pope, to proffer The King his readmission into the Church, And take off his six years interdiction Upon some propositions yet conceal'd, And this may busie the King yet. Y. Bru. This? the Greyhound Is not more eager at his flying game, Then I know King John is in his passions Gf love or anger. Ol. Bru. Why Brother, is this a time to study? Fitz. Troth I was thinking ofâstay, stay, I hav't, I was thinking brother Bruce,ânow tis gone again, And farewell it, lets ply our businesse now: If you mark't, he said he would begin with you; I Would have you to night (stay not for the Sun, which sure will rise blushing at this nights brawling) Do you and Richmond, with some score of men Post to your house, tis but an hours riding, And something more; there fortifie your selves, Your Ladie, and your pretty little Sonnne, Poor knave he dreams not of these Thunderbolts: You my young mad cap, with your Cuz my daughter, Shall unto Hartford Castle, she is the brand I feare will fire our Troy; Leister and I Will gather Powers, and thither after you; You two for Guilford, you two for Hartford, And we two, wheither wast we two must go? Leis. Go? we two must stay i'th City. Fitz. Passion of me, where was my memory; But come, come, when Kings our Dials retrograde do run, We leave to look on them, and go by'th Sun: Lights, lights, good Gentlemen: Exeunt. Enter Queene, Lady, Bruce, and Hubert. Qu. Good Lady take not on so, Oxford sayes all Is very well at London. Lady. Yes, very well; Why then follow'd he your Grace with a Troop of horse, A band of men? why hath he seizd the Castle, Cashierd my Servants? Oh Madam can it be, Your Grace (the Alter where I ever paid A Subjects devout Love,) should by a slight, a fained accidentall visite make, An entrance for hostility and terror. Qu. Hubert, redeem you in this Ladies faith, And relate the truth. Hub. Only upon mine honour Was I sent to seize this Ladies young Son George, As a pledge to'th King for her Lords loyalty. Lady. No Hubert, my Son is far enough from thee, Thou fatall keeper of poor Boys. Hub. You mean Concerning Arthur, the unfortunate Sonne Of Jeffery Plantaganet; Oh mad rumour! Who would trust thee but with so much reputation An honest begger boasts of? Q. In that beleeve me Madam, report hath wronged him, Which I can witnesse Lady. Enter King and Chester. Lady. The King come to, Oh my sweet George, my joy; what wilt thou do? K. All is to our desire; where's Bruces Sonne? Hub. Convey'd to Wales she affirms Sir. Lady. Where thou shalt never see him John. K. Good Madam, Wee'l speak with you anon, Queene Isabell, Thou must be still an agent to secure Me and my Kingdome, straight with the Earl of Chester; Post thou to Hartford Castle, whither we are certifi'd Young Bruce is fled with old Fitzwaters daughter, Try if by fair means thou canst win her to Attend on thee at Court; if we have not her A pledge, (as this) for her Fathers faith, we stand The food of faction, get her any way; If she deny, Chester with forces ready, Of from the Castle, shall give them fierce assault, And force them past entreaties; go my love And play the Amazon, with her surprisall, Secure a Kingdome. Qu. This craves hast and care; come noble Chester You shall along; but good my Lord forget not That Ladies kindnesse to me. K. Oh my sweet. Kisse. Exit. Hu. What a fine thing he makes the Queen; Oh lust, With what smooth craft thou creeptst to things unjust. K. Oh my Matilda, if power or policy may get thee once more in these arms, I will hazard Even to a Kingdom for thee; come Madam fear not I wear no frowns, I am all mirth, lets see your pretty Son. La. I fear your mirth is like the Porpoist pastimes, My Son hath been in Wales this moneth. K. Hubert, see the Gates lock'd, a guard upon the Walls, Whilst we take some to search. La. Where will you search King John? For heavens sake do not search. Hu. Nay and't be come to that. Exit. K. Let me go, In these proceedings the Kings safety rests, The Lyon must not bend to baser breasts. Exit. La. Heaven to thee I kneel, who affrighted Mother am, Oh from this Lyons claws keep my poor Lambe. Exit. Enter old Bruce, and Richmond, and above Oxford. Ol. Bru. The Castle Gates are shut, swift footed Tyranie, That canst when thou pursu'st thy wild desires, Out run the wantan Roe; Oh Richmond, Richmond, I fear our stay all night, ha's made me witness Of a day darker then night. Rich. Your fears and your afflictions Meet in one Center, for it seems the King Sent Oxford in the night on the walls; Behold where Oxford stands, I fear they have seiz'd Your Sonne, your Wife and Castle. Ol. Bru. Oxford, thou signe Set up to shew me where my sorrows dwell, Martyr me not with circumstances; but tell me, Is it (as from thy ominous presence there) We may conjecture. Ox. Because you request brevity, Then by my ominous presence here great Lords You conjecture that you come too late. Rich. Let force our entrance, We have twenty men of spirit to dare. Ol. Bru. A score of Cowards, Oxford, Dar'st thou be honourable? Ox. An other time, But now I have no leisure, the King is here. Rich. In person. Ox. Yes, and power; And if the Queen and Chester speed as the King has, We shall have a pledget too for Fitzwaters loyalty, And so good day, ye meet the proverb here, Ye both are early up but near the neare. Exit. Rich. We strongly may conclude from their intelligence Of your Son, and fair Matilda's flight to Hartford, Thither the Queen and Chester are repair'd, Either by force or policy to obtaine her, So that the nearest path to our proceedings. Is to post back to London, and to hasten Her Father thither with his powers, and so Secure your Sonne, his Daughter, and it may be, Surprise the Queen and Chester. Ol. Bru. If we do, If but a hair of my betrayed wife, Or my poor boy do perish, a head royall Shall be sent back, slight scratches leave no scars But deep wounds are seeds of Civill wars. Exit.</field>

You shall hear us sir first; we have been clouded Six years, but like the Sun in his Meridian, We now again are glorious; thus in briefe, Leister we require strong pledge for your loyalty; Bruce call your mad Son home from Hartford, Your Wife and Sonne shall better speed at Guilford, For Richmond in our re-assumed power. We will proclaime him Traytor, and Fitzwater, Either give up Matilda for your faith, or heare What we shall sentence. Leis. We must stand then What thunder you shall throw, perform with us, We kisse your royall hands. O. Bru. If not, we stand Rocks in our resoluton. K. D'ee heare them now sir? Fitz. Nay, nay, let him hear me too then: Lord Legate Pandulph; thus 'tis, And thus you may informe his holinesse, In a field cal'd running-Mead 'twixt Staines and Winsor, After some bloody noses on both sides, I tell truth I; there the King and Barrons Met for discussion of conceiv'd wrongs, And indeed not misconceiv'd, our Houses, Honours, Our Fathers freedomes, the Lands ancient Liberties (Unjustly to encrease some private Cofers) Felt daily Demunition, there to Covenants drawn, (Bearing the name and sence of Magna Charta, Which many hundred years may be seen hereafter) King John subscrib'd, we swore him fealty. K. Which fealty they deny'd, till our assoylment Of our six years Interdiction, forcing us therefore To seal unlawfull liberties. Leis. Upon our honours, They were but what Antiquity prov'd lawful. Ox. Oh but my Lord. Fitz. Tut, tut, Lord me no Lords, He broak, we powted, I tell plain truth I, Yet fell into no relapse of hostility, But wot ye what, he casts a covetous eye, Upon my Daughter, passionately pursues her, There had been other pledges but our oathes else, (For heaven knows them he had) and (amongst the rest) Matilda must be my pledge, for well he deem'd They yielding theirs, shame would brand my denyall, But catch craft, when we put truth to triall, Kings should have shining souls, and white desires Enflam'd with zeale, not parch'd by Paphian fires; So shines the soul in which vertue doth shrowd, Is a serene skie bespotted with no cloud, But a Copper conscience whil'st the head wears Gold, Is but a plain down-right untruth well told, Come, come, I cannot fawn. K. But in the passion Gf a Dog sir you can snarl; have you talk all your words? Fitz. I have told truth I. K. Then we will fall to deeds, Oxford command a Guard, and presently Take them to'th Tower; we can now talk and do, Away with them, and muzzel those fierce Mastiffes, That durst leap at the face of Majestie, And strike their killing fangs into honours heart; Are they not gone? we shall be passionate In your delay. O. Bru. Come Leister, let us wear Our sufferings like Garland. Leis. Tempest nor death, Could never out do Leister, who dares dye Laughing at times poyson'd integrity. Fitz. Now by my troth 'twas very nobly spoken, Shall I turne tale; no, no, no, lets go, But how things will be carried; ha! are these teares Body of me? they are; Shall I go like a sheep With this pair of Lyons; ha, ha, ha, I do laugh now John, and i'le tell thee why, Th'art yet in thy green May, twenty seven summers Set in our Kalends, but when forty Winters more Shall roun'd thy forehead with a field of snow, And when thy comely veins shall cease to flow, When those majestick eyes shall float in rhumes, When giant Nature her own selfe consumes, When thy swift Pulses shall but slowly pant, When thou art all a Volum of my want, (That like a tale-spent fire thou shalt sinck,) Then John upon this lesson thou wilt think He dyes a happy old man, whose sweet youth Was a continued sacrifice to truth; I must weep now indeed. Ki. Away with them. Exit. Pan. Unto King John, the favour of his holinesse, With peace and happinesse. Exit. K. Which we return With all filiall obedienceâlook up Oxford, The day breaks, and the Sun hath chaste the night Out of our Hemispheare. Enter a Gentleman. Ox. Your news sir? Gen. Letters from the Queen sir. K. Was the Earl Richmond there with any powers E're your departure. K. reads. Gen. No may it please your Majestie, we heard not of him, But all on your part went fair and fortunate K. Oh Oxford now they have her, flie back like lightning, Tell him this day wee'l meet them all at Barnet. Exit Gent. Ox. But her Father and her friends imprisonment May obdurate her heart, they dare not sure On the great perill of a curse to fall Into a Relapse now you are absolute. Faith sirtrie smooth paths to your ends, to release them, I hold the winningst way to captivate Their duties, and Matilda to your wishes. K. Good, do not kill me joy before our going, Instantly thou shalt flie with the Lords release, We pine in our delayes, oh Cupid swiftly Fly into Paphoes, and from thy Mothers shrine, Catch but a nimble wanton flame, and cast it Into the busie Kingdome of my heart, That it may teach my tongue the art of victory, And every year unto thy well-spent Quiver I'le add a shaft, and call it Cupids love Dart; Come Oxford, I tread methinks on aire, Untill I read that Volum of sweet grace, The well writ story of Matilda's face. Ox. She yeelds at last my life on't sir. Exit.</field>

Two dayes together, Good Mr. Brand, 'tis not mine own want beggs, But my poor Boyes; I have held him pretty pastime, To have him yet forget that wild woolf hunger, And still the harmlesse soul would point each period Of his sport, crying Mother give me bread. Bra. She has a winning way, Her carriage and her person are both exquisite: Faith tell me Madam, what would you give for some victuals To give your Son? La. Any thing, set thou the price thou shalt have Gold. Boy. And truly sir, if you'l but give me a Cake, Or a Capons legge, when I am a man, I'le give you twenty shillings to buy your Boy fine things.

Bra. See! I am asham'd to hear you, If such sinnes could not be done without being seen, Informers would have a fine trade on't, a Parators place Would counvaile five Serjeants; ha, ha, seen kither; Why there would not be sheets enough in the Land For the penitent, and innocent Beadles enough to correct the Guilty; Come, come, we'l do't i'th dark then.

She has put me to my sophistry. Qu. I knew I was made Your stale for her obtaining. Oh why Raise you so high a Piramis to her praise, And prostrate your own vertue? if she be Such a Book of goodnesse (with bad desires) Why do you read her? fie no truth intends, Seeks to corrupt that Text which he commends, Good sir consider it. Enter Hubert. K. Well, I will think on't, and you will have done. Hu. Now is the time my Lord, If e're you would be fortunate in your desires, Richmond, young Bruce, Matilda, (With the Earl of Chester prisoner,) and a slight convoy But of some threescore Horse, and two hundred Archers Are now i'th valley crossing of the County, 'Tis thought for Essex. K. Where are their main Forces? Hub. Inscon'st in Hartford Castle, our Forces yet Not so diminish'd, or in rout for want Of their lost Generall, but if you please, We dare with hope assail them. K. I will be Generall, Order the Powers you have for present on-set. Qu. My Lord, you said you would consider. K. I am considering bravely how to charge The Foe just in the face: Matilda I am now thy Souldier, Friend of my heart, the King himselfe comes for thee, Who shall in this dayes doings amply prove, Honour takes fire from the flame of love. Hu. Good fortune on our side sir. Exeunt. Manet Queen. Qu. Hear not that prayer A Charge afar off. Good heaven, oh tempt not vertue to adorn A foul Cause with fair fortunes: Hark, hark, they meet, And now pell mell the angry Lords do list Unnatuall swords, good heaven keep safe the King, But let his Cause miscarry; I will not stay To see him so pursue those wild desires, Which cannot sure end well; i'le to the Lords So near at hand, and with Matilda's Father, Accommodate my griefs, and let there be Her feares, my tears, the Kings infirmity. Exit Enter King, Oxford, and Matilda. K. Oxford, she's now the Kings. Ma. Most miserable Maid. K. Most excellent Matilda all are thy friends, Imperious love sat on my Lance just then, When on the panting brest of daring Richmond (Who like a melancholly sullen Cloud, Eclips'd thy Chariot) thou didst see me print My restlesse passion: Oxford keep my happinesse, Just with that care thou wouldst preserve that pair Of precious things, thine eyes; Chesters ingag'd Deep in the Chase, and we must fetch him off; Pardon me honour that I plac'd love first, My doings now are thine. Exit. Ox. Keep near the King, Gentlemen, His unbounded spirit may loose him else; good Madam Do not lament so, though your friends are scatter'd, Y'are in a spheare of happinesse. Mat. Oh that great power, That many times out of this toy I hath taken me, Deliver me again, because again, Vertue hath made me miserabl. Ent. young Bruce. Y. Bru. Oh that necessity Should force us unto flight, base flight, repugnant To man and honour. Ha! happy flight now, That brought me this way. Mat. Cozen. Y. Bru. Oxford, either give back That pure unspotted Dove, from the killing Tallon Of the forgetfull King, or thou or I Must never see him more. Ox. That to our fortunes, I must not faile the King sir. Y. Bru. I must not faile then Enter Richmond. To get her as I can sir. Fight, Oxford falls! Rich. We are scatter'd now Paste making head againe. Y. Bru. But I have made shift to get my Cuz agen sir. Rich. Let us not stay now to expostulate, Necessity Directs us to our friends not a league distant, If we not fly we are lost. Ma. Good Cuz lets flie, Tis no disgrace to obey necessity. Y. Bru. Oh I could stamp and tear that hagge necessity, Bitter necessity, thou scourge of things That forces Lyons to wear Swallows wings. Exe. Manet Ox. to him enter King, Chester, &amp; others. Ches. You have plaid the Souldier sir. K. The Souldier Chester; I am so light with joy, I could do any thing. Ches. Troth sir would it might please you then to grace Me with the President-ship of Picardy, Falne in this last Rebellion from the Lord Bruce unto your Crown. K. Tis thine as certaine As Matilda is the Kings: Oh Chester, now Matilda Is in the Kings power. Ox. No sir, she is in heavens. Ches. Who's this, Oxford, lets help to raise him up. K. What saist thou man? Matilda, where is Matilda? Ox. Young Bruce in his flight happening upon this way For her recovery gave me fierce assault; I did stand for you sir as much as man could, Till my mis-fortune found me, then I sell; To him came Richmond, and with all speed possible They have carried her to'th Lords on tother side the heath. K. Oh villaine, villaine; Suppose he had cut thy heart strings, hadst thou cast Thy dying eye upon Matilda's face? She would have shot another spirit into rhee, More daring then the first, at least more fortunate. Ches. Let him be convey'd to'th Town and drest, Our best course is now to with-draw, the Lords Are strong, and may give us dangerous chase else. K. What are our hopes Like Garlands, upon afflictions forehead worn, Kist in the morning, and at evening torne. Exit. A Table and Chaires set out. Enter Fitzwater, old Bruce, young Bruce, Richmond, and Leister. O. Bru. The day is then the Kings. Rich. White victory Clapt on her silver wings, with a sullen face Took leave of us, and pitched upon his Tent, Where she sat smiling, while necessity Enforced our flight. Y. Bru. Oh that witch Necessity. Fitz. Well, well, away with the witch, Tis well you brought Matilda off; come, come, Sit to Council. And brther Bruce you have a Wife and Sonne Unjustly detayn'd from you, I am injur'd, I pray set you our feet into the path Of our proceedings. Y. Bru. Lets with our powers Raze Winsor walls. Fitz. Now you are i'th field straight, Give old men leave; you would raze! what would you raze! Your reputation with your rash proceedings; Come, come, hear your Father. Y. Bru. Why let him speak then, O. Bru. First let us take up our affronts in order, And fix by ours, the Generalls grievances, The crying groans of England, whose blubberd cheeks Are stiffe with tears, to see their privildedges Daily impair'd. Rich. What's to be done? Leis. Let's send to the French King, Proffer him our assistance, to trans-fer The Crown from John to him, if at such a day He will put over a strong Navie Royall, With an Army for the attempt, with which (our Forces Making one body) both at at Sea and Land, We bid fair for our freedoms. Fitz. I do not like it. Y. Eru. S'foot, you will like nothing; Let us be ring'd and nooz'd, O. Bru. Besides, being assoil'd of his six years Interdiction, Those that before fled from him as a Leaper, Will now flock to him. Rich. They begin already, (Although we seek (with our own) their good,) to censure And call hostility plain faction. Leis. This is my resolve, I say there is no way To fix our freedomes, but to call in Philip And make him King. Exit Richmend. Om. So think we all. Fitz. I but I think not so, Though y'are all wise for Philip, he'l be a gainer, But what will you get by't? They run on Rocks and shelves, Can can counsell others, not secure themselves. Y. Bru. We must and will do something. Fitz. You will send to Philip, Instruct him to proceed, it may be furnish His Navie with our Pilots, he lands, we proffer Change, John for Philip; oh can you think, That we can undergo a heavier stroke From a Naturall, then from a Forreigne yoak; Go to, go to, who in no estate can rest, They may change oft, but seldome comes the best. Ol. Bru. I am diverted. Leis. Which way would you steer then? Fitz. By the same Compasse, but not upon this parallel, I do not like the line; but this wee'l do, Wee'l send for Lewis, Philips Sonne the Dolphine, And to him (seemingly) prefer the proffer, A Crown will fire him; may be he shall land, But with no more Force then we please; and it may be He shall take a fisher Town, for every Nation Can take away their trading as the time goes, Our maine Force being ready, we will hover 'Twixt John and Lewis; if John deny an oath To redresse our griefes, and become regular And Hostage for the keeping it, we joyne With the French and fright him further; if he consent, We fall on his part then, expulse Lewis, And send him to the Seas again; the Dolphine Is young and may be wrought on, but old Philip Is dangerously politick, with foot ashore, Hee'l brook no jugling, both ease, and safety We work on Willowes, but when we strike at Oaks, We sweat, and sometimes hurt with our own strokes. Om. It shall be thus effected. Leis. But let report divulge his Landing, With more eminent danger then we will let him practise. Fitz. For this time Ent. Queen, Matilda &amp; Ladies. Rise then; See the Queen and Ladies, Good Madam cast off sadnesse, Matilda we are all here i'th City safe; The very hearts o'th Citizens (men injur'd In their priviledges as we are) they are ours, What should we fear then? Enter Richmond. Mat. You are all such friends, I am poor in my well-meaning thankfulnesse. Rich. A Barge with divers youthfull Citizens, Apparell'd rich like Masquers, is now land'd Upon the Stairs, hearing the Queen was here, Withall this meeting of their noble friends, Proffer their loves and duties to conclude And grace the evening with their Revels. Fitz. In the Hall wee'l meet them. Did not I tell you These Citizens were noble lads our friends? Waite on the Ladies Lords, I am here your Graces servant, By my troth I thank 'em, they will crown our feast, And credite me, having such a princely guest. Exeunt. Loud Musick. Enter at one doore Fitzwater, old Bruce, young Bruce, Leister, Matilda and Ladies; at the other doore, the King, Chester, Oxford, Masquers. A Dance. Fitz. Now by my troth they are gallants, Citizens said you; now I remember to, Ye do go gallant in your Shops, no wonder then, If in Masques you cut it. I remember Gentlemen, Your Fathers wore a king of comely habite, Comely, because it wel became the reverend name of Citizens, But now let a Knight walk with you in your shops, (And I commend you for't, ye keep the fashion) We know not which is whichâ; how my tongue ranges, And night grows old, mad times, must have mad changes; Come, come, a Hall, a hall. The Masquers take the Ladies, and fall to the Dance. Qu. Beleeve me you have done well. Y. Bru. Pox a' these Cats guts, how they squeak. Methinks a rattling sheep-skin lustily boxt, Would thunder brave amongst them. One of the Torch bearers takes Matilda. Mat. I can dance no more indeed sir. Fitz. I am deceiv'd if that fellow did not carry A Torch e'n now; Will you shame the Gentleman? Dance when I bid you. Mat. Oh me, that graspe was like the Kings. O. Bru. Dance Cuz. Fitz. In good deed dance, Or you will make me angry. The K. pulls her violently. Body of me, that's too much for a Torch-bearer, You sir Jack, sir Jack, she is no whit-leather, She will not stretch I assure you, if you come hither For love so 'tis. K. For love. Eitz. But if you and your Company, Put on forgetfull rudenesse, pray take your Cupid yonder, Your thing of feathers, and your Barge stands ready To bear ye all aboard the ship of Fools, I am plain Robinâpassion of me! Look if he do not threaten me; I will see thee, Wert thou King John himselfe. Pulls off his Vizard. Om. The King! Mat. Oh which way shall I flie? Qu. I would not leave so sweet a chaste companion. Exeunt Qu. Mat. Rich, and Ladies. In the bussle, Fitzwater drops one of his Gloves, Hubert takes it up, and goes after the Ladies. Hub. What's this, one of her Fathers Gloves? This shall be drawn upon the luckie hand of a thriving plot. K. Behold thy King, thine Bruce, one of the Fathers Of these retir'd factions; Richmond, thy King, And thine rough Leister; is this still your nest Wherein to hatch another Scorpions Egge, To sting the afflicted bosome of your Country, To bruise her sides with the earth-wounding hoofes Of War-apparell'd Horses, whose dreadful neighings May fright her pale face to a bloody blush, And again make her groane. Fitz. Your pardon sir, By my good Sword I knew ye not. Ches. No, if you had, Your dangerous Brother Bruce and you, had laid Some plot for his sacred person; then pleaded ignorance, That ye took him as he seem'd, a sawcy stranger. Y. Bru. Chester, Thou art not noble in thy censure, And sawn'st thy selfe into the abus'd favour Of the to-credulous King. Ches. Oh temptation, what a Devill art thou; Now by my blood young man, you court my spleen In a vain glorious shape; Chester fawne, Just heaven forbid it. Y. Bru. An Axe upon your neck, ehe just heavens give you And that in heaven were justiceâ Ol. Bru. Sonne, y'are too full of choller. Y. Bru. Choller, Halter. Fitz. By the masse that's neer the choller. K. Upon your lives no more, the King is here; Fitzwater, I did not come to quarrell with thee, I would have such a good man ever neer me, And for a florish to the rest (of whom As of old Bruce we have) we will require strict pledges, and Fitzwater let thy Daughter live at Court, she shall be kept I'th custody of the Queen, but as no pledge. Fitz. The Queen is gracioue. K. Come, to their ruines leave these turbulent Lords. Fitz. But suppose the Queen should ride abroad to hunt, And leave Matilda solitary at home, I think the King would come and comfort her. Ki. I am of thy mind, I think he would. Fitz. Would he so?âI would have no one hear. Takes the K. aside, K. They cannot man. Fitz. Pray tell the King, ile keep my Girle at home, And comfort her my selfe. K. You will. Fitz. John, John, now I speak out; You made your Masque for this, a Masque indeed, And wel-a day! that it should prove a Cover For such a night of Tempests, such wilde affections, Such an ill-favour'd night. Enter Hubert. K. Hubert, is't done? Hub. Past expectation, I have better'd your plot, And got the Queene too, And will bring them early in the morning to'th Court. K. Have the Torch-bearers given fire to the plot? Hub. They mixt with oppertunity. Enter Richmond. Fitz. I do not like this whispering, Where are the Ladies and Matilda? Rich. The Ladies are at the further side the Castle, But by a Glove you sent by a Gentleman, That said he serv'd Earle Leister, that with him She and the Queene should flie for safety whither You had directed him, glad of any scape, They took a Barge, another leapt in after them, But whom he was I know not. Exit. Ol. Bru. Sent you a Glove. Fitz. A Glove indeed I misse, but I sent none. Leis. This is a Riddle. K. I will play Oedipus, and expound it for you, As Hubert has infus'd; you drop'd your Glove, Ingenius Hubert found it, and (though we Had directed otherwise,) he employ'd a Gentleman Of our own Chamber, one unknown to Matilda, To bring it as your close intelligence For her flight with him; he that leapt into'th Barge, As they put of, was Oxford, now we have her Never again to lose her. Leis. By my vext blood King John, this is not honourable. Enter Richmond. Rich. We are betray'd, All that bore Torches in the Masque to night, Were of the Guard, who upon a receiv'd watch-word, Fell to their Arms, beat down all oppos'd them, And are shaping their course this way. Y. Bru. Lets meet 'em, We have an injur'd patience, came death in whirle-winds, Ile be the first shall front him; to thy prayers John, Pray heartily, that thy friend; fatall points May pierce these hearts; for if they misse 'tshall prove The bloodiest beauty story ever told To fright the Readers souls; a purple cloud Shall shaddow England, the whole Land shall reele, The Center groans, thy very Crown shall stand Trembling upon thy Temples, till it fall A Mourner at thy fames black funerall. Exit. Fitz. Oh noble Nephew. Exeunt Barrons. K. Ha, ha, ha, let 'em rave on; Ingenious Hubert! That couldst so swifty apprehend a smooth Path to'th possession of Matilda! Quit Oxford from her charge; unto thy care The King commends the Mistresse of his heart, I'th morning let me see her. Hu. She shall waite upon you sir. Ches. The Barrens threaten high sir. K. Let them burst. Come Gentlemen, to'th Barge, and so to'th Court, To clip our wishes, perills appear sport. Exeunt.</field>

Fitz. Oh if a Fathers prayers, an old mans tears, An injur'd old mans tears, were ever prevalent, Good heaven keep my Girle a Christall Fort, Firme and unvuanquish'd. K. Hubert my friend now has her: Will it please the mighty Emperor of the Barrons, The King may kisse Matilda, she will be here presently, Then shall the great Fitzwater sit in state, And see Matilda and the poor King dallie, And teach the winds to wanton, Hubert now has her, The faithful'st of my friends, from contrarieties We will produce soft pleasures, sweet perfections; Sirrah, Chester shall tell me she then frowns, and Wee'l Court her cheeks into a comely smile; If she but raise that milkie hill, her breast, With respirations, Oxford shall swear it is a sigh, and I will seem to chide His rashnesse, and protest love rais'd that gale, Just as her heart for my heart had set sale. Fitz. Heare heaven! K. Chester shall watch her when she weeps, and tell me They are Matilda', tears, when I will presently With a lovers pleasing fervency, protest They are Pearls, by passion forc'd from Cupids Chest. Oxf. But what shall Hubert do, Your bosome friend? Ki. He shall with pretty thwarting passages (To please Matilda,) seeme to make me angry, And tell me 'tis impossible now t'obtain her; Whereupon (impatient, to illustrate love With a new passion) oh how I will rave! Misuse him strangely, and close up the sweet ScÅne Upon Matilda's lip. Enter a Gentleman. Gent. Letters from th'Earl Hubert sir, K. His name but now, (Like a beloved passenger,) took leave Of my unwilling lips, he waits directions Concerning her from me, good Chester read it, I cannot read and rejoyce too, Fitzwater Listen, and rave. Chester reads. Letter. May it please your excellent Majestie, it hath, pleas'd heaven so throughly to captivate my reason by the potent pleadings of your vertuous Queene, and unmatch'd Matilda, that I hold it now impossible for your Majestie ever to obtain her. K. Ha! Fitz. That last was musick. K. Nay kill us all, kills us all; will ye read on sir? Let. Briefly, by that time these Letters kisse your Royall hands, she will be cloysterd up in Dunmow Abbey, and end her dayes a Vestall, wheither I could not choose but convey her, being thereunto forcibly charmed by her teares and entreaties, and especially forc'd by a secret command from heaven to mine owne conscience; I remaine your most excellent Majesties transgressing servant Hubert. K. Most excellent villaine! Fitz. Observe King John, e're heaven will vertue faile, Contrary meanes, all winds shall fill her saile. Ches. How like a Hare, the Greyhounds chaps still at her, Yet still she scapes! the King is full of tempest. K. She's gone for ever. Oh Hubert let us never meet again, Never more meet; Fitzwater fetch her but back, As from the first, so from this Isabell Wee'l be divorc'd, marry and set Matilda I'th regall Chaire, the Kings admired Mistresse. Fitz. But will ye say and do sir? K. Yet there is hope; now by my Crown I will, We shall be Sonne and Father, thou and I Will walke upon our Pallace battlements, And thou shalt carty up a covetous eye, And thou shalt cast that covetous eye about The fair, delightful village-spotted valleyes, Thou shalt stand still, and think, and recollect The troubl'd longings of thy large desires, And whatsoever thou shalt aske the King, (Of all thou see'st) the King shall give it thee. Fitz. Well, let one one ride before, and certifie That we are comming. K. Chester, put on wings: To himselfe. Thou good old man, the bird that croak'd now sings. Exeunt.</field>

Lady Abbesse, Pray give me leave, and hearken my Matilda, I bring thee golen news my Girle, we have cast An ill-becomming Calumnie upon The Kings love all this while; for he protests To be divorc'd from Isabell the Queene, And by marriage set thee in his Bed, A plant to spring and prosper; women naturally Do affect soveraignty; wilt thou runne retrograde In this faire Zodiack? though all wayes yet Have fail'd, this will take I am sure. To the King. Mat. Who hath taught my Father To turn Apostate to that integrity Slept in his noble breast? through a divorce I run to golden ruine; the King marry me? K. And make thee Queen of him, and two large Kingdoms, The Christian world when they shall hear, shall wonder, And magnifie in their abundant praises, The glory of our Marriage. Mat. Oh my Lord, here I can call necessity, Excellent Physick for a vast desire, Our wants are holy waters, cast on lust's fire. Fitz. Oh brave, brave Girle! That I had thee here to buss thee, Her very breath did smell of heaven. K. Matilda! Fitz. I have found thee Gold my Girle, These are glorious wrestlings, Celestial struglings; passion of me, that joy Should carry Aprill eyes. weeps. K.

Fitz. Tut, tut, I know whose Cause I have in hand, And neither ha's nor hems can fright plain Robin, The wound that foolish love-Boy there (what call ye him?) Had struck your heart with, because your smooth tongue, You could not come to supple it, as the Dog does his foot, With fair fine words you could lick me, and then Lift me to stroak it, and heale it by Atturney, He steers not steddy thae delights to roame, Craft sets out swift, but ever comes short home: I tell ye truth I. K. Abbesse, deliver up Mattlda, Or with an Army fill'd with Ruffians, Ravishers, The very Sonnes of darknesse, we will levell This building to the bottome. A. We know the King, (Being reconcil'd unto his mother Church,) Cannot conceive such out-rage. Appears passionate Fitz. Now ye stamp, do ye. Mat. Father farewell, and to my Lord my King, The service of his most obsequious Hand-maid,; And good your Maiestie be pleas'd to remember, How excellently-admirable your Crown Will then become ye, when you shall cast off The habite of your passions, I will pray for you sir, And if't be possible with prayers and teares, Quench your desires, and fortifie my feares. Exe. Fitz. A Fathers blessing, like a welcome cloud With child of friendly showers, hover o're thy goodnesse, And keep it evergreenâ; she is gone sir. K. Go thou and runne into the Sea. Fitz. Ha, ha, So the great Emperor of the Barrons, As you cal'd him, May come out again i'th guts of a poor John: No, no, I will live and laugh, you would have made her The mistresse of the King, and she is married To the Kings Master, oh to the noblest King Poore supplicant ever kneel'd to, to your King, And her King, and to my King she's married; Oh married, married, let the Satyrs dance it, The sweet Birds sing it, let the winds be wanton, And as they softly with an evening whisper, Steal through the curl'd locks of the lofty woods, Let them in their sweet language seem to say, This, this was chaste Matilda's Marriage day. Exit Fitz. K. It is resolv'd irrevocable; who waits? Enter Chester. Ches. Sir? Enter Confessor. K. Have an eye apon that Fox; where's our Confessor? Con. Attending sir. K. Your earâdo this, Con. I shall sir. K. And hark you, without all expostulation, speedily Make Brand the Instrument. Con. I shall not fail sir. Exit. K. All my blood turns, she is now past all recovery; Oh day draw in thy light, Time do not keep This Deed for story; Memory fall asleep In black oblivions Cavern; let this day Still skip the Kalend, and be wip'd away From all discourse; oh let no chaste Maid. (Remembring how Matilda was betray'd,) With bitter teares, curse the too cruell King; No Satyr dance this day, no sweet bird sing, But let the Raven and Scretch-Owl cry, Matilda the chaste Maid, must this day dye. Exit. Enter Brand and the Abbesse reading a Letter. Lett. Madam, These are to giye you to understand, that instantly, and without any the least expostulation, you see convey'n into the outward Garden adjoyning to the Abby, your new Votary Matilda, that the bearer (this Gentleman) may without the least interception, have freedome of accesse unto her; let this from me be your safety, and forget not, the wills of Princes are indisputableâ Fustace Confessor to his Majestie. Ab. No, no, no cloud of niceness, order, or regularity, Must intercept this Mandate; Sir, the Kings will, The Confessors advertizement, and your hopes, Shall meet this minute; but vertue is I hope The Rudder of your voyage. Bra. I tell you Madam, 'tis unspotted truth, The King is chang'd so excellent, such a lover Now of Matilda's noble constancy, That therefore as his (Confessor there certifies,) Your duty is expected To work my admittance to her, which is onely To let her know, how heartily his Majestie Admires and commends her. Ab. Tis a joyful hearing, Enter Matilda. See where she walks, souls so heavenly simple, It seems the Court digests not, and (being cloy'd,) Commends them to the Cloyster. Exit. Bra. And she be so simple, She's the fitter for the Saints, things I near think of, Unlesse to stuffe our similiesâexcellent Lady. There's such a deale of heaven in her face, It makes my black soul trembleâexcellent Lady, Ma. Your will sir. Bra. To let you understand the will of him, Whose will the will of heaven hath new made; Thus said King John in briefe, tell that sweet Saint, (And there he wept as I do at the though on't) weeps. The immaculate Mistresse of my dear devotions. The King by this (with her eye not unacquainted) Commends to her his hate of all that love, The feavor of his blood contaminated: Oh tell her (and he sigh'd there bitterly) That as I was her tempter, I am now Mine own despiser; as mine own despiser, I will remain her vertues strong admirer; And there just thus he kist itâif't chance, quoth he, Her gentle lip return the Kings chaste meaning, Mark but which place of this (then happy (Glove Receives that heavenly print, and bring it back, That my lips there (like a paire of willing Pilgrims) May pay my hearts devotions. This was all, And this, his Glove, the Token. Mat. Excellence Change! Heaven now hath heard my praiers, return his goodnesse; I am sorry thou hast kist the Glove before me, For feare thy lips have lay'n where the Kings did, And cosen'd mine of that grace fell from them, When he spake things thus good, Give me the Glove. Bra. Ha: He looks towards the Garden door, and whilst she turns her self that way, he changes the Glove, and gives her the other poyson'd. Mat. Thy looks made me beleeve, that some were coming. Bra. No Madam, I have cosen'd you, 'twas but the wind. Mat. No wind shall keep my duty from his Majestie With my observance; say thus, I return'd Kisses the poyson'd Glove. My love of his great goodnesse; and if he aske thee How I receiv'd the news of his rare change, Say, as a teeming soyle after a drought, Welcomes a wish'd for shower: what a strange sent Strongly beats up into my braines, while I hold this Glove So neer my breast! thou art not honest sure? Bra. Neer death we prophesie, and 'tis so sure, You cannot breath three minutes. Mat. Ha! Bra. Tis neatly don, and there's no dallying, I know 'tis strong and swift, as by a Glove You were carryed from your Fathers to this Cloyster, So by a Glove you are from this Cloyster sent To the chaste Court of Saints. Mat. Heaven! is this right? Bra. No, 'twas a left-handed Glove, look ye, I kist the right and cosen'd you, So that a sinister act with a left-handed Glove, very prettily Imports a wittynesse in wickednesse. Mat. Thou art a merry murderer, the King was wont To call me friend; oh if he bestowes On's friends such guifts, what sends he to his foes? Uncharitable love-token; oh what harsh hand Temperd this dram of death. Bra. I could do't no better. Mat. Mercilesse man, Tygers to thee are tame; Oh cozening Crocadile, that with thy tears couldst take me! How wilt thou howse When thou and I meet next? when I shall sit Above my sufferings, then will my blood be A cloud betwixt eternity and thee. Bra. Clouds? yes, much clouds. Mat. There was the last call; to the King, commend me, And tell him, when in stories he shall stand, When men shall read the Conquerors great name, Voluptuous Rusus, that unkind brother Beauclark, Comely King Steven, Henry the Wedlock-breaker, And Lyon-hearted Richard; when they come unto his name, with sighs it shall be said, This was King Johnâthe murderer of a Maid; Oh tell him I am past his strong temptations, And though wild burning back'd his hot desire, Like perfect Gold I did out-live the fire. Dyes. Bra. She's dead and I must shift for one, I heare some trampling, Enter young Bruce. What's he has leap'd the Garden walls? has a wenching look, And should be a good Vaulter, guilty knaves make excellent Eves droppers, and I love to sound strange bosomes, I will lye To see and heare, and yet not heard nor seen, stands aside. Y. Bru. Here rumour gives, my cousin, chaste Matilda To live a Votary: ha! on the ground! Murder'd most certainly, and so warme, that yet The murderer at my approach, may lurk About the Garden, for through the Abbey tis Impossible to passe; oh my griev'd blood, Who made it so unfortunate to be good. Bra. He mumbles something to himselfe. Y. Bru. This parallels my Mother and my Brother: Ha! something stirs i'th Grove, passion I know thee not, With a new art we must catch old Blood-hounds: well, Although I am the Kings well-wishing friend, And have rais'd forces for his part at Winsor, Yet with my heart I am glad, a friendly hand Hath made thee happy. Bra. S'foot this is one of our side, But it seems he knows not twas the Kings injunction. Y. Bru. Now businesse will be minded, state affairs, With vigilance effected, which before Were so intangled in your hair forsooth, Suiters could find no end of their beginnings. Bra. By this light I have done a good deed. Y. Bru. Thou honest soul, That (by the heat of thy happy hany-work,) Canst not I am sure but be in hearing; If My irregular start (upon private necessity) Frighted thee off, be not asham'd to let Thy unknown friend possesse thee. Bra. Oh braze young spark. Y. Bru. Or if thy modesty must keep thee off, So well I love thy work (and as I the Kingdom) Let this Purse of Gold, this Diamond fasten'd to't, Tell thee thy friend was here, if thould'st know him, He is a kinsman to the Earl of Chester; And because thou shalt not doubt thy friends fair meanings, I will return the way I came, although With danger to my person. Bra. Here is one sir, wishes better to his friends. Y. Bru. What art thou? Shewes himselfe. Bra. One that will take your honoorable Purse, And yet passe quit at the Common Law. Y. Bru. Wert thou the expert Master of this peece. Bra. You being kinsman to my Lord and Master, (Who ever hated this blood;) I dare tell you, I practis'd first a businesse late at Winsor, Upon a Mother and her Sonneâ Y. Bru. Hold heart, old Bruces Lady, And the brat her Sonne? Wer't thou the happy instrument To cut these Houses down? didst thou do that? Bra. It would deserve (well priz'd) another Purse sir. Y. Bru. Gold must not part us, didst do't? Gives him more Gold. Bra. Both that and this, by this stand sir. Y. Bru. Sonne of the Devill have I found thee? Bra. Sure he knows me. Y. Bru. Fool, dost thou draw a sword; What a loud lye thou dost give heaven, to think A sword can shield the guilty, look here villaine Upon my horrid point, where death in tempest And whirle-winds, stares upon thee, thou murderer: Of my Mother, Brother, and my Kinswoman. Bra. S'root here was a Purse with a bob at the end ont, Pray take your Purse againe. Y. Bru. Toad, I will take thy heart first. Bra. I deny nothing then, Resolution crowns my craft; for those at Winsor, (Let me free the King.) I famish'd them, because Your Mother was too coy, you may guess the rest; For this it was King Johns injunction, And I have done it daintily by this light. Y. Bru. By darknesse and her Angels, Thy near kinsmen, Thou shalt not live five minutes for't. They fight, Brand falls, young Bruce keeps him down. Bra. O sir, what mean ye? Y. Bru. To aske thee for a Mother, a sweet Brother, A chaste kinswoman; oh that thou couldst be Ten daies a dying; Slave! i'le stick thy Trunck So thick with wounds, it shall appear a Book Full of red Letters, Characters of thy cruelty stabs him. Bra. This is no bleeding moneth sir. Y. Bru. Thou lyest, look yonder; There lyes mine Almanack, a celestiall body, Points to Matilda's Course. Whose revolution, period, pale aspect, All tell me 'tis high time that thou shouldst bleed. Stabs. Bra. Oh. Y. Bru. Thy veines are all corruption, Toads belch not fouler; And should thy Trunck be thrown upon a dunghill, (As it deserves no better buriall) The sent would poyson swine, the very dogs Would with howlings fly as from a mid-night fiend, And every Raven that should feast upon't, Would seek forsaken Deserts, and there die Full of infection. Stabs. Bra. Oh that last has finish't me, And where I go I know not, a bloody Cloud Hath hid heaven from me like a purple shrowd. Dyes. Y. Bru. Feast thou the Crows, This body i'le convey to Winsor, where my Mother, And my sweet murther'd Brother, wee'l expose (As spurs of righteous vengeance) to all eyes; Conscience, and Blood, are strong incessant cryes. Exit. Enter King and Lords below, old Bruce, Leister Oxford and Fitzwater above. Charge. K. You Sonnes of death and disobedience; Why is the King kept out? Ol. Bru. You shall know sir; Is't not enough the whole Lands Liberties Lye yet a gasping by your head strong passions, Wounded by your neglect, but through blood D'ee chase your vast desires, my Wife and Sonne sir. K. A game as we are Prince, in our Royall word, The villaine past our precept. Ol. Bru. As you past heavens In your bloody masquing night at Baynards Castle, When all the floores, and the white walls wore bloody Deep crimson blushes, to behold a Prince In blood pursue his passions. K. Bar'd out and brav'd, You bate and chafe a Lyon; bring old Fitzwater, Thou Bruce and grumbling Leister, either speedily Give up the Castle, and upon your knees Fall to the mercy you have scorn'd, or here Before a paire of minutes passe, the sword Of incens'd justice shall even in your eyes, Leave this old Rebell headlesse. Fitz. Now by the blood I lost in holy Palestine with Richard, Oh that right reall Souldier! King John I sweare, That foul-word Rebel has unrivited The bars of reason, and made me very angry; Is it to take truths part to be a Rebel? To ease my groaning Country, is that Rebellion? To preserve the unstain'd honour of a Maid, (And that maid my daughter) to preserve your glory, That you stand not branded in our Chronicles, By the black name of Wedlock-breaker; is this (Good, heaven!) is this Rebellion? Come, come, the Axe; Oh that wrong'd soul to death so falsely given, Ent. Mowbray Flies sweetly singing her own truth to heaven. Mow. Stand on your guard sir, Young Bruce with twenty thousand Strong able men from Cambridge and Essex, With a speedy march, and with as dreadful threatnings, Comes thundering towards Winsor, all his Ensigns Crimson and black, which in their wanton wavings, Cry to the frighted Country (as he marches) Nothing but blood and death. Ol Bru. Oh noble Sonne of a murpered Mother. Leis. Honourable young man. K. Draw up our forces like a pair of angry winds, That have got a hollow Cloud with child of tempests, Wee'l make the valleyes tremble. Enter Chester. Ches. Resist now sir, Or the whole Kingdome trembles, Lewis the Dolphines By th'politique working of ingenius Richmond, (Who was sent for him) with six hundred sayle, And fourscore Flat-boats is let in at Dover, Subduing as they march, and the Towns willingly Giving them way; they have reach'd Rochester, And if a speedy swift prevention meet not, They will for London certainly. Leis. Now John thy Crown sits quivering. Ches. These here so resoluteâ Mow. Young Bruce so potentâ Oxf. And which strikes deepe, a factious forraigne foot Upon our earth, 'tis a dangerous triplcity, So that our Forces were they three times trebl'd, (Distracted with a division thus trianguler) Cannot promise safety. K. Take it not Time, for now The goodliest Oak in the whole wood must bow. Fitz. Oh that was very well said sir, nor shall ye bow, But unto heaven and vertue, for Kings have boasted To be her servants; oh in this tempest sir, Give her the helme, good brother Bruce, the King Has faithfully acquitted him of the bloods Of your Wife and Sonne,; Leister, the King now looks Upon his passions with a displeased eye, Trust to our faiths sir, give the Land her Liberties, And do but look upon my poor Matilda. K. Oh, oh. Fitz. With Kingly chaste eyes; and a holy soul; My brother shall command his Sonne to obedience, Leister and he shall give ye up the Castle, We will call Richmond with his powers from Lewis, We will be all one soule againe, and force The skipping French to put to Sea again, And you shall stand a King then absolute, Good brother Leister, sir upon my knee, I urge your goodnesse now; shall we still stand And chaine our freedomes to a forraign hand? When we shun seen Rocks, then we safely sayle; Good, good, King John, let the old man prevaile. K. Oh Chester run to Dunmow, and if Brand yet Have kept his hand white, bid that Brand forbear, For feare of burning everlastingly. Ches. I shall sir. Exit. K. Mowbray, with the bendings of the King, Go meet that angry young man Bruce, and tell him, Here's now no use for steele. Mow. 'Twill be good news sir. K. Meet us at least (you stubborn men,) In our facile affections: Why send ye not for Richmond? must we bend, and And beseech too? Leis. Passe but your Royal promise In the words of a King, to performe what Y'are fled from, the wind not with more swiftnesse, Shall fly to play with Richmonds lofty Plume, Then shall be shown in his repeale. K. 'Tis granted upon our Kingly wordâthat time in me, shall read that Giants force necessity! Ol. Bru. With all submissive reverence we descend, And kisse your Highnesse hand. Fitz. Right happy day, My Girle is safe, and all clouds blown away. Exeunt from the walls Hoboyes sound, whilst the Barrons descend, each on his knee kissing the Kings hand, both Parties joyfully embrace; suddenly the Hoboyes cease: and a sad Musick of Flutes heard. Enter to the King and Lords, the Lady Abbess, Ushering Matilda's Herse, born by Virgins, this Motto fastned unto itâTo Piety and Chastity. The Body of Matilda lying on the Herse, and attended by the Queene, bearing in her hand a Garland, compos'd of Roses and Lillies; after her, young Bruce, Hubert, Chester, and other Gentlemen, all in mourning habites. The Song in parts. 1. Looke what Death hath done! here laid (In one) a Martyr, and a Maid. 2. Angels Crown Those with just applause. Dye in defence of Vertues Lawes. Chorus Such was her cause! Death! boast not of thy hands Cruelty, since the uanquish'd victor stands. 2. Her Chastity, to Time shall last Like Laurel, which no lightning can blast. 1. Sweet Maids, with Roses deck her Herse, Whose Vertue stands above the reach of Verse. Chorus Heaven hath her pure part, whil'st on Earth, her Name Moves in the Spheare of a refulgent Fame. K. Hubert interpret this Apparition. Hub. Behold sir, A sad writ Tragedy so feelingly, Languag'd, and cast, with such a crafty cruelty, Contriv'd and acted, that wild Savages, Satyrs, and the rude rabble of the Woods, Would weep to lay their ears to, and (admiring To see themselves out done) they would conceive Their wildnesse, mildness to this deed, and call Men more then Savage, themselves rationall; And thou Fitzwater, reflect upon thy name, And turn the sonne of tears, oh forget That Cupid ever spent a dart upon thee, That Hymen ever coupled thee, or that ever The hasty, happy, willing messenger, Told thee thou hadst a Daughter; oh look here, Look here King John, and with a tembling eye, Unvailes her face. Read your sad act, Matilda's Tragedy. Om. Matilda! Fitz. By the labouring soul of a much injur'd man, It is my childe Matilda. Qu. Oh cruell King, go sate thy bloody eye With thy black command, which there lyes executed. Ol. Bru. Sweet Neece, Leis. Chaste soule, Y. Bru. King, go and read thy cruelty. K. Do I stirre Chester? Good Oxford, do I move? stand I not still To watch the when the griev'd friends of dead Matilda, Will with a thousand stabs turn me to dust? That in a thousand prayes they may be happy; Wil no one do't? then give a mourner room, Falls passionately upon the Herse. A man of tears; oh immaculate Matilda, These sheed but sayling heat drops, misling showers, The faint dews of a doubtful April morning; But from mine eyes, ship-sincking Cataracts, Whold clouds of waters, wealthy exhalations Shall fall into the Sea of my affliction, Till it amaze the Mourners. Hub. Unmatch'd Matilda, Celestiall Souldier that keep'st a Fort of Chastity 'Gainst all temptations. Fitz. Not to be a Queene Would she break her chaste vow, truth crowns your reed, Unmatch'd Matilda was her name indeed. K. Oh take into your spirit-piercing praise, My ScÅne of sorrow; I have wel-clad woes, Pathetick epethites to illustrate passion, And steale true teares so sweetly from all these, 'tshall touch the soule, and at one pierce and please. Ches. What will he doe? The Ki. takes the Garland from the Queen, and peruses the Motto of the Herse. K. To Ptety and Purity, and Lillies mixt with Roses. How well you have apparell'd woe, this pendant To Piety and Purity directed, Insinuates a chaste soule in a clean body: Vertues white Virgin, Chastities red Martyr, Suffer me then with this well-suited wreath, To make our griefs ingenious, let all be dumb, Whilst the King speaks her Epicedium. Ches. His very soul speaks sorrow. Ox. And it becomes him sweetly. K. Hail Maid and Marty! loe on thy breast, Devotions Alter, chaste truths chest, I offer (as my guilt imposes) Thy merrits Laurel, Lillies and Roses, Lillies, intimating plaine, Thy immaculate life stuck with no staine; Roses red, and sweet, to tell How sweet red sacrifices smell; Sets the Garland on her breast. Hang round then as you walk about this Herse, The songs of holy hearts, sweet, vertuous verse, Fitz. Bring Persian silks to deck her Monument, K. Arabian spices quick'ning by their sent. Fitz. Numidian Marble to preserve her praise, K. Corinthian Ivory her sweet shape to raise. Fitz. And write in gold upon it, in this brest, Virtue sat Mistresse passion but a guest; K. Virtue is sweet, and since griefs bitter be, Strew her with Roses, and give Rue to me. Ol. Bru. My noble Brother, I have lost a Wife and Son, You a sweet Daughter, look on the Kings penitence, His promise for the Kindomes peace, perfer A publique benefit. When it shall please, Let heaven question him, let us secure, And quit the Land of Lewis. Fitz. Do any thing, Do all things that are honourable, and the great King, Make you a good King sir; and when your soul Shall at any time reflect upon your follies, Good King John weep, weep very heartily, It will become you sweetly, at your eyes Your sin stole in, there pay your sacrifie. K. Back unto Dunmow Abby, where wee'l pay To sweet Matilda's memory and her sufferings, A monthly obsequie, which (sweetned by The wealthy woes of a tear-troubl'd eye) Shall by those sharp afflictions of my face, Court Mercy, and make Grief arrive at Grace. Let my wil'd errors, tell to time this truth; Whil'st passion holds the Helm, Reason and Honour Do suffer wrack; but they saile safe, and cleer, Who constantly by Virtues Compasse steer. Song. 1. Matilda! Now goe take thy Bed, In the darke dwellings of the dead. 2. And rise in the great Waking-day, Sweet as Incense, fresh as May. 1. Rest thou chaste soule, (fixt in thy proper spheare,) Amongst heauens faire Ones; All are fair ones there. Cho. Rest there chaste soul, whilst we (here troubl'd) say, Time gives us Griefs, Death takes our joyes away. Exeunt omnes.</field>
