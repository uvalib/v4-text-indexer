      <field name="fulltext">It is a noble and iust aduantage, that the things subiected to vnderstanding haue of those which are obiected to sense, that the one sort are but momentarie, and meerely taking; the other impressing, and lasting: Else the glorie of all these solemnities had perish'd like a blaze, and gone out, in the beholders eyes. So short-liu'd are the bodies of all things, in comparison of their soules. And, though bodies oft-times haue the ill luck to be sensually preferr'd, they find afterwards, the good fortune (when soules liue) to be vtterly forgotten. This it is hath made the most royall Princes, and greatest persons (who are commonly the personaters of these actions) not onely studious of riches, and magnificence in the outward celebration, or shew; (which rightly becomes them) but curious after the most high, and heartie inuentions, to furnish the inward parts: (and those grounded vpon antiquitie, and solide learnings) which, though their voyce be taught to sound to present occasions, their sense, or doth, or should alwayes lay hold on more remou'd mysteries. And, howsoeuer some may squemishly crie out, that all endeuour of learning, and sharpnesse in these transitorie deuices especially, where it steps beyond their little, or (let me not wrong 'hem) no braine at all is superfluous; I am contented, these fastidious stomachs should leaue my full tables, and enioy at home, their cleane emptie trenchers, fittest for such ayrie tasts: where perhaps a few Italian herbs, pick'd vp, and made into a sallade, may find sweeter acceptance, than all, the most nourishing, and sound meates of the world. For these mens palates, let not me answere, O Muses. It is not my fault, if I fill them out Nectar, and they runne to Metheglin. Vaticana bibant, si delectentur. All the curtesie I can doe them, is to crie, againe; Prætereant, si quid non facit ad stomachum. As I will, from the thought of them, to my better subiect. On the night of the Masques (which were two, one of Men, the other of Women) the scene being drawne, there was first discouered an Altar; vpon which was inscribed, in letters of gold. Mystically implying, that both it, the place, and all the succeeding ceremonies were sacred to marriage, or Vnion; ouer which Iuno was President: to whom there was the like Altar erected, at Rome, as shee was called Inga Iuno, in the street, which thence, was named Jugarius. See Fest. and, at which Altar, the rite was to ioyne the marryed payre with bands of silke, in signe of future concord.Io n i. Oi m a e. Mi m a e. VNIONI SACR.

On the other hand, entred Hymen (the god of marriage) in a saffron-coloured robe, his vnder-vestures white, his socks yellow, a yellow veile of silke on his left arme, his head crowned with Roses, and See how hee is called out, by Catullus in Nupt.

The song being ended, Hymen presented himselfe formost; and, after some signe of admiration, began to speake. HYMEN. What more then vsuall light (Throughout the place extended) Makes Ivno's fane so bright! Is there some greater deitie descended? Or raigne, on earth, those powers So rich, as with their beames Grace Vnion more then our's; And bound her influence in their happier streames? 'Tis so: this same is he, The king, and priest of peace! And that his Empresse, she, That sits so crowned with her owne increase! O you, whose better blisses Haue proou'd the strict embrace Of Vnion, with chast kisses, And seene it flow so in your happie race; That know, how well it binds The fighting seedes of things, Winnes natures, sexes, minds, And eu'rie discord in true musique brings: Sit now propitious Aides, To Rites, so duely priz'd; And view two noble Maides, Of different sexe, to Vnion sacrific'd. In honour of that blest Estate, Which all good minds should celebrate. Here out of a Microcosme, or Globe, (figuring Man) with a kind of contentious Musique, issued forth the first Masque, of eight men. These represented the foure That they were personated in men, hath (alreadie) come vnder some Grammaticall exception. But there is more then Grammar to release it. For, besides that Humores and Affectus are both Masculine in Genere, not one of the Specialls, but in some Language is knowne by a masculine word: Againe, when their influences are common to both Sexes, and more generally impetuous in the Male, I see not, why they should not, so, be more properly presented. And, for the Allegorie, though here it be very cleare, and such as might well escape a candle, yet because there are some, must complaine of darknesse, that haue but thicke eyes, I am contented to hold them this Light. First, as in naturall bodies, so likewise in minds, there is no disease, or distemperature, but is caused either by some abounding humor, or peruerse affection; after the same maner, in politick bodies (where Order, Ceremony, State, Reuerence, Deuotion, are parts of the Mind) by the difference, or prædominant will of what we (metaphorically) call Humors, and Affections, all things are troubled and confused. These, therefore, were tropically brought in, before Marriage, as disturbers of that mysticall bodie, and the rites, which were soule vnto it; that afterwards, in Marriage, being dutifully tempered by her power, they might more fully celebrate the happinesse of such as liue in that sweet vnion, to the harmonious lawes of Nature and Reason. Humors, and foure Affections, all gloriously attired, distinguisht only by their seuerall Ensignes and Colours; and, dauncing out on the Stage, in their returne, at the end of their daunce, drew all their swords, offered to encompasse the Altar, and disturbe the Ceremonies. At which, Hymen troubled, spake: HYMEN. Saue, saue the virgins; keepe your hallow'd lights Vntouch'd; and with their flame defend our Rites. The foure vntemp'red Humors are broke out, And, with their wild affections, goe about To rauish all Religion. If there be A Power, like Reason, left in that huge Bodie, Or little world of Man, from whence these came, Looke forth, and with thy bright and Alluding to that opinion of Pythagoras; who held, all Reason, all Knowledge, all Discourse of the Soule to be meere Number. See Plut. de Plac. Phil. numerous flame Instruct their darknesse, make them know, and see, In wronging these, they haue rebell'd 'gainst thee. Hereat, Reason, seated in the top of the Globe (as in the braine, or highest part of Man) figur'd in a venerable personage, her haire white, and trayling to her waste, crowned with lights, her garments blue, and semined with starres, girded vnto her with a white bend, fill'd with Arithmeticall figures, in one hand bearing a Lampe, in the other a bright Sword, descended, and spake: REASON. Forbeare your rude attempt; what ignorance Could yeeld you so prophane, as to aduance One thought in act, against these mysteries? Are Vnion's ?????, with the Greekes value the same, that Ceremoniæ with the Latines; and imply all sorts of rites: howsoeuer (abusiuely) they haue bin made particular to Bacchus. See Serv. to that of Virg. Æneid. 4. Qualis commotis excita sacris Thyas. orgies of so slender price?

Her selfe nor suffers spring, nor end, nor change. No wonder, they were you, that were so bold; For none but Humors and Affections would Haue dar'd so rash a venture. You will say It was your zeale, that gaue your powers the sway; And vrge the masqued, and disguis'd pretence, Of sauing bloud, and succ'ring innocence? So want of knowledge, still begetteth iarres, When humorous earthlings will controll the starres. Informe your selues, with safer reuerence, To these mysterious rites, whose mysticke sence, Reason (which all things, but it selfe, confounds) Shall cleare vnto you, from th'authentique grounds. At this, the Humors and Affections sheathed their swords, and retired amazed to the sides of the stage, while Hymen began to ranke the Persons, and order the Ceremonies: And Reason proceeded to speake. REASON. The Paire, which doe each other side, Though (yet) some space doth them diuide, This happie Night must both make one Blest sacrifice, to Vnion.

Vnxia doth professe. She was named Iuga, propter Iugum, (as Seruius sayes) for the yoke which was impos'd, in Matrimony, on those that were maried, or (with Sex. Pomp.

The straines were all notably different, some of them formed into Letters, very signifying to the name of the Bridegrome, and ended in manner of a chaine, linking hands: To which, this was spoken. REASON. Svch was Mentioned by Homer Ilia ?. which many haue interpreted diuersely: al Allegorically Pla. in Thæteto, vnderstands it to be the Sunne, which while he circles the world in his course, all things are safe, and preserued: others vary it. Macrob (to whose interpretation, I am specially affected in my Allusion) cõsiders it thus: in Sum. Scip. libr. I. cap. I4. Ergo cùm ex summo Dio ment, ex mente anima sit; anima verò &amp; condat, &amp; vita compleat omnia quæ sequuntur, cunctaque hic vnius fulgor illuminer, &amp; in vniuersis appareat, vt in multis speculis, per ordinem positis, vultus vnus; Cumque omnia continuis successionibus te sequantur, degenerentia per ordinem ad imum meand: invenietur pressius intuenti à summo Deo vsque ad vltimam rerum facem vna mutuis se vinculis religans, &amp; nusquam interrupta connexio. Et hæc est Homeri Catena aurea, quam pendere de cœlo in terras Deum iussisse commemorat. To which strength and euennesse of connexion, I haue not absurdly likened this vniting of Humours, and Affections, by the sacred Powers of Marriage. the Golden Chaine let downe from Heauen; And not those linkes more euen, Then these: so sweetly temper'd, so combin'd By Vnion, and refin'd. Here no contention, enuy, griefe, deceit, Feare, iealousie haue weight; But all is peace, and loue, and faith, and blisse: What harmony like this? The gall, behinde the altar quite is throwne; This sacrifice hath none. Now no affections rage, nor humors swell; But all composed dwell. O Ivno, Hymen, Hymen, Ivno! who Can merit with you two? Without your presence, Venvs can doe nought, Saue what with shame is bought; No father can himselfe a parent show, Nor any house with prospe'rous issue grow. O then! What deities will dare With Hymen, or with Ivno to compare? The speach being ended, they dissolu'd: and all tooke forth other persons, (men, and women,) to daunce other measures, galliards, and corranto's; the whilst this song importun'd them to a fit remembrance of the time.

Their Daunces yet lasting, they were the second time importun'd, by speach. REASON. See, see! the bright Stella Ueneris, or Venus, which when it goes before the Sunne, is call'd Phosphorus, or Lucifer; when it followes, Hesperus, or Noctifer (as Cat. translates it.)

Haste therefore, haste, and call, away: The gentle night is prest to pay The vsurie of long delights, Shee owes to these protracted rites. At this (the whole scene being drawne againe, and all couer'd with cloudes, as a night) they left off their entermixed dances, and return'd to their first places; where, as they were but beginning to moue, this song, the third time, vrg'd them.

Here they danc'd their last dances, full of excellent delight and change, and, is their latter straine, fell into a faire orbe, or circle; Reason standing in the midst, and speaking. REASON.

Long may his Vnion find increase As he, to ours, hath deign'd his peace. With this, to a soft strayne of musique, they pac'd once about, in their ring, eury payre making their honors, as they came before the state: and then dissoluing, went downe in couples, led on by Hymen, the Bride, and Auspices following, as to the nuptiall bower.

Shrinke not, soft Virgin, you will loue, Anon, what you so feare to proue. This is no killing warre, To which you pressed are; But fayre and gentle strife Which louers call their life.

Helpe youths, and virgins, helpe to sing The prize, which Hymen here doth bring, And did so lately The Bride was alwayes fain'd, to be rauish'd, ex græmio matris: or (if shee were wanting) ex proximâ necessitudine, because that succeeded well to Romulus, who, by force gat wiues for him, and his, from the Sabines. See Fest. and that of Catul. Qui rapis teneram ad vir? virginem. rap From forth the mothers lap, To place her by that side Where shee must long abide. On Hymen, Hymen call, This night is Hymen's all. See, Hespervs is yet in view! What starre can so deserue of you? Whose light doth still adorne Your Bride, that, ere the morne, Shall farre more perfect be, And rise as bright as he; When When he is Phosphorus, yet the same starre, as I haue noted before.

Seruius faith, because it was sacred to Uesta, Plut. in Quæst. Rom. remembers diuers causes. But that, which I take to come neerest the truth, was onely the auoyding of Sorcerous drugs, vs'd by Witches to be bury'd vnder that place, to the destroying of marriage-Amitie, or the Power of generation, See Alexand, in Genialibu. and Christ. Landus vpon Catul. lift your golden feet Aboue the threshold, high, With prosperous augury. Now, youths, let goe your pretty armes; The place within chant's other charmes. Whole showers of roses flow; And voilets seeme to grow, Strew'd in the chamber there, As Venvs meade it were. On Hymen, Hymen call, This night is Hymen's all. Good Matrons, that so well are knowne To aged husbands of your owne, Place you our Bride to night; And For this, looke Fest. in Voc.

So, now you may admit him in; The act he couets, is no sin, But chaste, and holy loue, Which Hymen doth approue: Without whose hallowing fires All aymes are base desires. On Hymen, Hymen call, This night is Hymen's all. Now, free from vulgar spight, or noyse, May you enioy your mutuall ioyes; Now, you no feare controules, But lips may mingle soules; And soft embraces bind, To each, the others mind: Which may no power vntie, Till one, or both must die. And, looke, before you yeeld to slumber, That your delights be drawne past number; “Ioyes, got with strife, increase. Affect no sleepy peace; But keepe the Brides fayre eyes Awake, with her owne cryes, Which are but mayden-feares: And kisses drie such teares.

So may they both, e're day, Rise perfect euerie way. And, when the babe to light is showne, Let it be like each parent knowne; Much of the fathers face, More of the mothers grace; And either grandsires spirit, And fame let it inherit.

So eithers strength out-liue All losse that Age can giue: And, though full yeares be told, Their formes grow slowly old. Hitherto extended the first nights Solemnitie, whose grace in the execution, left not where to adde vnto it, with wishing: I meane, (nor doe I court them) in those, that sustain'd the nobler parts. Such was the exquisit performance, as (beside the pompe, splendor, or what we may call apparrelling of such Presentments) that alone (had all else beene absent) was of power to surprize with delight, and steale away the spectators from themselues. Nor was there wanting whatsoeuer might giue to the furniture, or complement; eyther in riches, or strangenesse of the habites, delicacie of daunces, magnificence of the scene, or diuine rapture of musique. Onely the enuie was, that it lasted not still, or (now it is past) cannot by imagination, much lesse description, be recouered to a part of that spirit it had in the gliding by. Yet, that I may not vtterly defraud the Reader of his hope, I am drawne to giue it those briefe touches, which may leaue behind some shadow of what it was: And first of the Attyres. That, of the Lords, had part of it (for the fashion) taken from the antique Greeke statue; mixed with some moderne additions: which made it both gracefull, and strange. On their heads they wore Persick crownes, that were with scroles of gold-plate turn'd outward, and wreath'd about with a carnation and siluer net-lawne; the one end of which hung carelesly on the left shoulder; the other was trick'd vp before, in seuerall degrees of foulds, betweene the plates, and set with rich iewels, and great pearle. Their bodies were of carnation cloth of siluer, richly wrought, and cut to expresse the naked, in manner of the Greeke Thorax; girt vnder the brests with a broad belt of cloth of gold, imbrodered, and fastened before with iewels: Their Labels were of white cloth of siluer, lac'd, and wrought curiously betweene, sutable to the vpper halfe of their sleeues; whose nether parts, with their bases, were of watchet cloth of siluer, chev'rond all ouer with lace. Their Mantills were of seuerall colour'd silkes, distinguishing their qualities, as they were coupled in payres; the first, skie colour; the second, pearle colour; the third, flame colour; the fourth, tawnie: and these cut in leaues, which were subtilly tack'd vp, and imbrodered with Oo's, and betweene euerie ranke of leaues, a broad siluer lace. They were fastened on the right shoulder, and fell compasse downe the back in gracious folds, and were againe tyed with a round knot, to the fastning of their swords. Vpon their legges they wore siluer Greaues, answering in worke to their Labells; and these were their accoutrements. The Ladies attyre was wholly new, for the inuention, and full of glorie; as hauing in it the most true impression of a celestiall figure: the vpper part of white cloth of siluer, wrought with Ivnoes birds and fruits; a loose vnder-garment, full gather'd of carnation, strip't with siluer, and parted with a golden Zone: beneath that, another flowing garment, of watchet cloth of siluer, lac'd with gold; through all which, though they were round, and swelling, there yet appeared some touch of their delicate lineaments, preseruing the sweetnesse of proportion, and expressing it selfe beyond expression. The attyre of their heads did answer, if nto exceed; their haire being carelesly (but yet with more art, then if more affected) bound vnder the circle of a rare and rich Coronet, adorn'd with all varietie, and choise of iewels; from the top of which, flow'd a transparent veile, downe to the ground; whose verge, returning vp, was fastened to either side in most sprightly manner. Their shooes were Azure, and gold, set with Rubies and Diamonds; so were all their garments; and euerie part abounding in ornament. No lesse to be admir'd, for the grace, and greatnesse, was the whole Machine of the Spectacle, from whence they came: the first part of which was a ???????????, or Globe, fill'd with Countreys, and those gilded; where the Sea was exprest, heightned with siluer waues. This stood, or rather hung (for no Axell was seene to support it) and turning softly, discouered the first Masque (as wee haue before, but too runningly declared) which was of the men, sitting in faire composition, within a mine of seuerall metalls: To which, the lights were so placed, as no one was seene; but seemed, as if onely Reason, with the splendor of her crowne, illumin'd the whole Grot. On the sides of this (which began the other part) were placed two great Statues, fayned of gold, one of Atlas, the other of Hercvles, in varied postures, bearing vp the Clouds, which were of Releuè, embossed, and tralucent, as Naturalls: To these, a cortine of painted clouds ioyned, which reach'd to the vpmost roofe of the Hall; and sodainely opening, reueal'd the three Regions of Ayre: In the highest of which, sate Ivno, in a glorious throne of gold, circled with Comets, and fierie Meteors, engendred in that hot and drie Region; her feet reaching to the lowest: where, was made a Rainebow, and within it, Musicians seated, figuring airie spirits, their habits various, and resembling the seuerall colours, caused in that part of the aire by reflexion. The midst was all of darke and condensed clouds, as being the proper place, where Raine, Haile, and other watrie Meteors are made; out of which, two concaue clouds, from the rest, thrust forth themselues (in nature of those Nimbi, wherein, by Homer, Virgil, &amp;c. the gods are fain'd to descend) and these carried the eight Ladies, ouer the heads of the two Atlas, and Hercules, the Figures mentioned before. Termes; who (as the engine mou'd) seem'd also to bow themselues (by vertue of their shadowes) and discharge their shoulders of their glorious burden: when, hauing set them on the earth, both they and the clouds gathered themselues vp againe, with some rapture of the beholders. But that, which (as aboue in place, so in the beautie) was most taking in the Spectacle, was the sphere of fire, in the top of all, encompassing the ayre, and imitated with such art and industrie, as the spectators might discerne the Motion (all the time the Shewes lasted) without any Moouer; and that so swift, as no eye could distinguish any colour of the light, but might forme to it selfe fiue hundred seuerall hiewes, out of the tralucent bodie of the ayre, obiected betwixt it, and them. And this was crown'd with a statue of Ivpiter, the Thunderer. On the next Night, whose solemnitie was of Barriers (all mention of the former being vtterly remoued and taken away) there appeared, at the lower end of the Hall, a Mist made of delicate perfumes; out of which (a battaile being sounded vnder the stage) did seeme to break forth two Ladies, the one representing Truth, the other Opinion; but both so alike attired, as they could by no note be distinguish'd. The colour of their garments were blue, their socks white; they were crown'd with wreaths of Palme, &amp; in their hands ech of th? sustain'd a Palm-bough. These, after the Mist was vanisht, began to examine each other curiously with their eyes, and approching the state, the one expostulated the other in this manner. TRVTH. Who art thou, thus that imitat'st my grace, In steps, in habite, and resembled face? OPINION. Graue Truth is fained to be the daughter of Saturne: who, indeed, with the Ancients, was no other then Time, and so his name alludes, ??????, Plut. in Quest. To which conferre the Greeke Adage, ???? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? ??????. time, and industry my parents are; My name is Trvth, who through the sounds of warre (Which figure the wise minds discursiue fight) In mists by nature wrapt, salute the light. TRVTH. I am that Trvth, thou some illusiue spright; Whom to my likenesse, the black sorceresse night Hath of these drie, and empty fumes created. OPINION. Best Herald of thine owne birth, well related: Put me and mine to proofe of words, and facts, In any question this faire houre exacts. TRVTH. I challenge thee, and fit this time of loue, With this position, which Trvth comes to proue; That the most honor'd state of man and wife, Doth farre exceede th'insociate virgin-life. OPINION. I take the aduerse part; and she that best Defends her side, be Trvth by all confest. TRVTH. It is confirm'd, With what an equall brow To Trvth, Hippocrat, in a certaine epistle to Philopœm, describeth her, Mulierem, quæ non mala videatur sed audacior aspectu &amp; concitatior. To which, Cæsare Ripa in his Iconolog, alludeth, in these words, Faccia, ne bella, ne dispiaceuole, &amp;c. Opinions confident! and how, Like Trvth, her habite shewes to sensuall eyes! But whosoe're thou be, in this disguise, Cleare Trvth, anon, shall strip thee to the heart; And shew how mere phantasticall thou art. Know then, the first production of things, Required two, from mere one nothing springs: Without that knot, the theame thou gloriest in, (Th'vnprofitable virgin) had not bin. The golden tree of marriage began In paradise, and bore the fruit of man; On whose sweet branches angells sate, and sung, And from whose firme roote all society sprung. Love (whose strong vertue wrapt heau'ns soule in earth, And made a woman glory in his birth) In marriage, opens his inflamed brest; And, lest in him nature should stifled rest, His geniall fire about the world he darts; Which lippes with lippes combines, and hearts with hearts. Marriage Loves obiect is; at whose bright eyes He lights his torches, and call's them his skies. For her, he wings his shoulders; and doth flie To her white bosome, as his sanctuary: In which no lustfull finger can profane him, Nor any earth, with blacke eclipses wane him. She makes him smile in sorrowes, and doth stand Twixt him, and all wants, with her siluer hand. In her soft lockes, his tender feet are tied; And in his fetters he takes worthy pride. And as geometricians haue approou'd That lines, and superficies are not moou'd By their owne forces, but doe follow still Their bodies motions; so the selfe-lou'd will Of man, or woman should not rule in them, But each with other weare the anademe. Mirrors, though deckt with diamants, are nought worth, If the like formes of things they set not forth; So men, or women are worth nothing, neither, If eithers eyes and hearts present not either. OPINION. Vntouch'd virginitie, Laugh out; to see Freedome in fetters plac'd, and vrg'd 'gainst thee. What griefes lie groning on the nuptiall bed? What dull societie? In what sheets of lead Tumble, and tosse the restlesse married paire, Each, oft, offended with the others aire? From whence springs all-deuouring auarice, But from the cares, which out of wedlocke rise? And, where there is in lifes best-tempred fires An end, set in it selfe to all desires, A settled quiet, freedome neuer checkt; How farre are married liues from this effect? A narrow sea, betweene Aulis, a port of Bœotia, and the Isle Eubœ. See Pom. Mela. li. 2. Evripvs, that beares shippes, in all their pride, Gainst roughest windes, with violence of his tide, And ebbes, and flowes, seuen times in euery day, Toyles not more turbulent, or fierce then they. And then, what rules husbands præscribe their wiues! In their eyes circles, they must bound thier liues. The moone, when farthest from the sunne she shines, Is most refulgent; neerest, most declines: But your poore wiues farre off must neuer rome, But wast their beauties, neere their lords at home: And when their lords range out, at home must hide (Like to beg'd monopolies) all their pride. When their lords lift to feed a serious fit They must be serious; when to shew their wit In iests, and laughter, they must laugh and iest; When they wake, wake; and when they rest, must rest. And to their wiues men giue such narrow scopes, As if they meant to make them walke on ropes: No tumblers bide more perill of their neckes In all their trickes; then wiues in husbands checkes. Where virgins, in their sweet, and peacefull state Haue all things perfect; spinne their owne free fate; Depend on no proud second; are their owne Center, and circle; Now, and alwayes one. To whose example, we doe still heare nam'd One god, one nature, and but one world fram'd, One sunne, one moone, one element of fire, So, of the rest; one king, that doth inspire Soule, to all bodies, in their royall spheare: TRVTH. And where is marriage more declar'd, then there? Is there a band more strict, then that doth tie The soule, and body in such vnity? Subiects to soueraignes? doth one mind display In th'ones obedience, and the others sway? Beleeue it, marriage suffers no compare, When both estates are valew'd, as they are. The virgin were a strange, and stubborne thing, Would longer stay a virgin, then to bring Her selfe fit vse, and profit in a make. OPINION. How she doth erre! and the whole heau'n mistake! Looke, how a flower, that close in closes growes, Hid from rude cattell, bruised with no ploughes, Which th'ayre doth stroke, sun strenght? showres shoot higher, It many youths, and many maydes desire; The same, when cropt by cruell hand is wither'd, No youths at all, no maydens haue desir'd: So a virgin, while vntouch'd she doth remaine, Is deare to hers; but when with bodies staine Her chaster flower is lost, she leaues to appeare Or sweet to young men, or to maydens deare. That conquest then may crowne me in this warre, Virgins, O virgins, flie from Hymen farre. TRVTH. Virgins, O Virgins, to sweet Hymen yeeld, For as a lone vine, in a naked field, Neuer extolls her branches, neuer beares Ripe grapes, but with a headlong heauinesse weares Her tender body, and her highest sproote Is quickly leuell'd with her fading roote; By whom no husbandmen, no youths will dwell; But if, by fortune, she be married well To th'elme, her husband, many husbandmen, And many youths inhabit by her, then: So whilst a virgin doth, vntouch't, abide All vnmanur'd, she growes old, with her pride; But when to equall wedlocke, in fit time, Her fortune, and endeuor lets her clime, Deare to her loue, and parents she is held. Virgins, O virgins, to sweet Hymen yeeld. OPINION. These are but words; hast thou a knight will trie (By stroke of armes) the simple veritie? TRVTH. To that high proofe I would haue dared thee. Ile strait fetch champions for the bride and me. OPINION. The like will I doe for Virginity. Here, they both descended the hall, where at the lower end, a march being sounded with drummes and phifes, three entred (led foorth by the Earle of Notingham, who was lord high Constable for that night, and the Earle of Worc'ster, Earle Marshall) sixteene knights, armed, with pikes, and swords; their plumes, and colours, carnation and white, all richly accoutred, and making their honors to the state, as they march'd by in paires, were all rank'd on one side of the hall. They plac'd sixteen others like accoutred for riches, and armes, onely that their colours were varied to watchet, and white; were by the same Earles led vp, and passing in like manner, by the state, plac'd on the opposite side. By this time, the barre being brought vp, Trvth proceeded. TRVTH. Now ioyne; and if this varied triall faile, To make my Trvth in wedlockes praise preuaile, I will retire, and in more power appeare; To cease this strife, and make our question cleare. Whereat Opinion insulting, followed her with this speach. OPINION. I, doe: it were not safe thou shouldst abide: This speakes thy name, with shame to quit thy side. Heere the champions on both sides addresst themselues for fight, first single; after three to three: and performed it with that alacrity, and vigor, as if Mars himselfe had been to triumph before Venvs, and inuented a new masque. When on a suddaine, (the last sixe hauing scarcely ended) a striking light seem'd to fill all the hall, and out of it an angell or messenger of glory appearing. ANGEL. Princes, attend a tale of height, and wonder. Trvth is descended in a second thunder, And now will greete you, with iudiciall state, To grace the nuptiall part in this debate; And end with reconciled hands these warres. Vpon her head she weares a crowne of starres, Through which her orient hayre waues to her wast, By which beleeuing mortalls hold her fast, And in those golden chordes are carried euen, Till with her breath she blowes them vp to heauen. She weares a robe encha'sd with eagles eyes, To signifie her sight in mysteries; Vpon each shoulder sits a milke-white doue, And at her feet doe witty serpents moue: Her spacious armes doe reach from East to West, And you may see her heart shine through her brest. Her right hand holds a sunne with burning rayes, Her left a curious bunch of golden kayes, With which heauen gates she locketh, and displayes. A christall mirror hangeth at her brest, By which mens consciences are search'd, and drest: One her coach-wheeles hypocrisie lies rackt; And squint-ey'd slander, with vaine-glory backt Her bright eyes burne to dust: in which shines fate. An angell vshers her triumphant gate, Whilst with her fingers fans of starres shee twists, And with them beates backe Error, clad in mists. Eternall Vnitie behind her shines That fire, and water, earth, and ayre combines. Her voyce is like a trumpet lowd, and shrill, Which bids all sounds in earth, and heau'n be still. And see! descended from her chariot now, In this related pompe shee visits you. TRVTH. Honor to all, that honor nuptialls, To whose faire lot, in iustice, now it falls, That this my counterfeit be here disclos'd, Who, for virginitie hath her selfe oppos'd. Nor, though my brightnesse doe vn-doe her charmes, Let these her knights thinke, that their equall armes Are wrong'd therein. “For valure wins applause “That dares, but to maintayne the weaker cause. And Princes, see, 'tis meere Opinion, That in Trvth's forced robe, for Trvth hath gone! Her gaudie colours, piec'd, with many folds, Shew what vncertainties shee euer holds: Vanish adult'rate Trvth, and neuer dare With proud maydes praise, to prease where nuptialls are. And champions, since you see the Truth I held, To sacred Hymen, reconciled, yeeld: Nor (so to yeeld) thinke it the least despight. “It is a conquest to submit a right. This royall Iudge of our contention Will prop, I know, what I haue vnder-gone; To whose right sacred highnesse I resigne Low, at his feet, this starrie crowne of mine, To shew, his rule, and iudgement is diuine; These doues to him I consecrate withall, To note his innocence, without spot, or gall; These serpents, for his wisedome: and these rayes, To shew his piercing splendor; these bright keyes, Designing power to ope the ported skyes, And speake their glories to his subiects eyes. Lastly, this heart, with which all hearts be true: And Trvth in him make treason euer rue. With this, they were led forth, hand in hand, reconciled, as in triumph: and thus the solemnities ended.</field>
