      <field name="fulltext">SAUL. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, by Vittorio Alfieri, to SAUL. TO THE NOBLE THE LORD ABBOT, THOMAS VALPERGA OF CALUSO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Saul. Jonathan. David. Abner. Ahimelech. Michal. Soldiers of the Israelites. Soldiers of the Philistines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Camp of the Israelites in Gilboa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. David. Da. Here, God omnipotent, wilt thou that I Restrain that course to which thou hast impell'd me? Here will I stand?âThese are Gilboa's mountains, Now forming Israel's camp, exposed in front To the impious Philistine. Ah, that I Might fall to-day beneath the enemy's sword! But death awaits me from the hand of Saul. Ah cruel and infatuated Saul, Who, without giving him a moment's respite, Through caverns, and o'er cliffs, dost chase thy champion. And, notwithstanding David formerly Was thy defender: all thy confidence In me hadst thou reposed; me didst thou raise To honour's pinnacle; and as a spouse I was by thee selected for thy daughter ... But, as an inauspicious dowry, thou Didst ask of me, dissevered from thy foes, A hundred heads: and I have brought of them To thee, faithfully brought, a double harvest ... But Saul, I clearly see, in thought is stricken; Long hath he been so; to an evil spirit His God abandons his perverted mind: Oh Heaven! Distracted mortals, what are we If God forsake us?âNight, do thou soon yield Thy shades to the glad sun; for he to-day The witness of a generous enterprise Is destined to shine forth. Gilboa, thou Shalt, to the latest ages, be renown'd; They shall record of thee, that David here Himself surrendered to ferocious Saul.â March forth, oh Israel, from thy peaceful tents; March forth from them, oh King: I challenge you To-day to witness, if I yet am versed In military arts. And march thou forth, Impious Philistine; march thou forth, and see Whether my sword have yet the power to smite. SCENE THE SECOND. Jonathan, David. Jon. What voice hath caught my ears? I hear a voice Skilful to penetrate my heart. Da. Who comes? ... Oh that the dawn would rise! Fain would not I Like a base fugitive present myself ... Jon. What! ho! Who art thou? Near the royal tent, What is thy business? Speak. Da. 'Tis Jonathan ... Courage.âA son of war, and Israel's stay, Am I. Philistia trembles at my name. Jon. What do I hear? Ah! David could alone Thus answer. Da. Jonathan ... Jon. My brother ... David! Da. Oh joy! ... To thee ... Jon. And can it then be true? Thou in Gilboa? Fear'st thou not my father? I tremble for thee! ... Da. Wherefore speak'st thou thus? Death present, in the fight, a thousand times Have I beheld and braved: for a long time I have since fled thy father's unjust rage; But to the valiant fear alone is death. No longer now I fear: with mighty danger The monarch, and his people, are encompass'd; Shall David be the recreant meanwhile To skulk securely in untrodden forests? While imminent o'er you the weapons hang Of the unfaithful, shall I take a thought Of my own safety? I come here to die; But, like a hero, in my country's cause, Amid the clash of arms, and in the camp, And for that very ill-requiting Saul Who now pursues me with the cry of death. Jon. Oh virtue, worthy David! God's elect Thou art assuredly. That God hath sent His angel as his minister to guard thee, Who with such superhuman thoughts inspires Thy lofty heart.âYet to the monarch's presence How shall I bring thee? He believes, or feigns, That thou art enroll'd among his enemies; And taxes thee with treachery and rebellion. Da. Alas! too forcibly he tempted me To seek a refuge 'mid the foes of Israel. But if those foes impugn him with their arms, I war with them, for him, till they're subdued. Then let him afterwards repeat to me My ancient recompense,âhis hate and death. Jon. Unhappy father! There are who deceive him. Perfidious Abner, a dissembling friend, Is ever at his side. The ghastly demon, That hath possess'd, and subjugates his heart, At least bestows on him a transient respite; But Abner's unrelenting artifice Never forsakes him. He alone is heard, He only; he alone is loved. To Saul, Like a malignant parasite, he paints All that surpasses his frail excellence, As dangerous and uncertain. With thy father, In vain thy wife and I ... Da. My wife! Loved name? Where is my faithful Michal, where? Does she, Spite of her cruel father, love me yet? Jon. Love thee, say'st thou? ... She, too, is in the camp ... Da. Oh Heaven! Shall I behold her then? Oh joy! How came she in the camp? ... Jon. Her father felt Pity for her; alone he would not leave her, A victim to her sorrow, in the palace: And even she, though always sad, affords To him some comfort. Ah! since thy departure, Our house, indeed, has been the house of tears. Da. Beloved spouse! Thy renovating look Will banish every thought of past distress; Banish all thoughts of suffering to come. Jon. Ah, hadst thou seen her! ... Scarcely had she lost thee, When every ornament her grief disdain'd: With loathsome ashes her dishevell'd hair; With desolation, pallidness, and tears, And leanness, was her countenance disfigured; Profound mute grief sat on her trembling heart. A thousand times each day she prostrate fell Before her father; and with sobs exclaim'd, âRestore my David, thou who gav'st him to me.â Her garments thence she rent; and, weeping, bathed Her father's hand, that even he shed tears. Who could refrain?âAbner alone; and he Insisted that, half dead e'en as she was, She should be sever'd from her father's feet. Da. Oh sight! Oh what dost thou recount to me? Jon. Would it were not the truth! ... At thy departure Peace, glory, enterprise in arms, departed. The hearts of Israel are benumb'd with dread; Philistia's sons, who heretofore appear'd Mere striplings when we fought beneath thy banners, Now, since no more we have thee for our leader, With port colossal stalk before our eyes: Pent in this valley, mindless of ourselves, Threats, insults, and derision, we endure. Why should we wonder? Israel hath at once In David lost her judgment and her sword. I, who, pursuing thy heroic steps, Elate with conscious glory trod the camp, Now feel my right-hand impotent to smite. Now that so often I behold thee, David, Exposed to hardships, sever'd from my side, Pursued by danger, now no more I seem To combat for my monarch, and my father, My wife, my children; far more dear to me Art thou than country, father, wife, and sons ... Da. Thou lovest me, and more than I deserve: May God reward thy love ... Jon. The God of justice, The swift rewarder of true excellence, He is with thee. By dying Samuel wert thou In Rama recognized; the sacred lips Of the anointed prophet, by whose means My sire was crown'd, great marvels prophesied Of thee in after times: hence, in my sight Thy life is no less sacred than beloved. Th'insidious perils of the court alone For thee alarm me; not those of the camp. But death, and treachery; death's harbinger, Round these pavilions hover evermore: Death, Abner gives it; often Saul commands it. Ah, David! hide thyself; until, at least, The mountain echo with the warlike trumpet. To-day I deem that we shall be compell'd To meet our foes. Da. And shall a valorous deed Be like a scheme of guilt by stealth transacted? Saul shall behold me ere I meet my foes. I bring with me what must confound; what must Reform the hardest of all harden'd hearts, I bring; and first the fury of the king, Then that of hostile swords, I will confront.â What canst thou say, oh king, if I to thee Bend, as thy servant, my submissive brows? I who, the husband of thy daughter, ask Pardon of thee for ne'er committed faults: Thy ancient champion I; who in the jaws Of mortal danger, as thy comrade, shield, Or victim, offer now myself to thee.â The sacred old man dying greeted me In Rama, and address'd me like a father; And in my arms expired. As his own son He formerly loved Saul: but what reward Had he for this? The holy, dying man, Enjoin'd my love and fealty to the king, Not less than blind obedience to my God. His latest words shall be, e'en till I die, Indelibly engraven on my heart: âAh, wretched Saul! if thou art not more wise, âThe wrath of the Most High will fall upon thee.â This Samuel said to me.âMy Jonathan, Fain would I see thee from the just revenge Of Heaven exempt: and thou, I trust, shall be: And so we all shall be; and Saul, who yet May pardon seek, and reconcilement gain. Ah woe, if th'everlasting send his bolt Of vengeance from the gaping firmament! Thou know'st, that often in the fierce career Of his retributory punishments, He hath involved the guiltless with the guilty. His irresistible, impetuous flash On earth rebounds, extirpates, and dissolves, With the infected reprobated plant, The flowers, the fruits, the foliage of the rest. Jon. David can, with his God, do much for Saul. Oft in the visions of the night I've seen thee, And so sublime in look, that at thy feet Prostrate I've fallen.âMore I shall not say; Nor more should'st thou to me. Long as I live, I swear, that sword of Saul shall ne'er descend To injure thee, no never. But, oh Heaven! How can I screen thee from vile stratagems? ... Here, 'mid the pleasures of the costly banquet, Here, 'mid th'accordance of bewitching sounds, Is poison oft imbibed in faithless gold. Ah! who from this can guard thee? Da. Israel's God, If I deserve deliverance; not a host, If I deserve destruction.âBut inform me, Can I now see my wife before my father? Till the dawn breaks I would not enter there ... Jon. On downy plumes doth she await the day? Before the dawn she duly comes to me To weep thy absence; and together here We put up prayers to God for our sick father ... Behold! a form in white not far from us Gleams indistinctly: perhaps it is she: A little step aside, and listen to her; But if it be another, do not now, I pray thee, shew thyself. Da. I will obey thee. SCENE THE THIRD. Michal, Jonathan. Mi. Long hated night, wilt thou ne'er disappear? ... But doth the sun, indeed, for me arise The harbinger of joy? Ah wretched me! For I in everlasting darkness pine!â Hast thou, my brother, left thy bed the earliest? Yet, certainly, my frame, that never rests, Was most exhausted. But how can I rest On easy pillows, while on the hard earth, Banish'd, a fugitive, within the dens Of cruel beasts, and watch'd by ambush'd foes, My David lies? Ah, father, fiercer far Than ravening monsters of the wilderness! Hard-hearted Saul! Thou takest from thy child Her husband, and thou takest not her life?â Hear me, my brother, here no more I tarry: 'Twill be a noble deed if thou go with me: But if thou go not, I alone will venture His footsteps to retrace. I am resolved To find my husband, or to suffer death. Jon. Delay a little while; and dry thy tears: Perhaps our David will come to Gilboa ... Mi. What say'st thou? Can he e'er approach the place Which Saul inhabits? ... Jon. David will be drawn, Drawn irresistibly by his fond heart, And his unswerving constancy, t'approach The place where Jonathan and Michal dwell. Dost thou not think that his prevailing love Can bid defiance to the power of fear? And would'st thou wonder if he dared come hither? Mi. Oh, I should tremble for his life ... But yet The seeing him would make me ... Jon. And if he Fear'd nothing? ... and should he with arguments Defend his vent'rous enterprise?âThe king, Less terrible in his adversity Than in prosperity, bewilder'd stands, His powers mistrusting; this thou know'st full well. Since the invincible right-hand of David For him disperses not yon hostile ranks, Saul fears; but, arrogant, he speaks it not. Each of us in his face can well discern That hopes of victory are not in his heart. Perhaps this moment he would see thy spouse. Mi. Yes, it is true perhaps; but he is far; ... Ah! where? ... and in what state? ... Jon. More than thou thinkest He is near to thee. Mi. Heavens! ... why mock me thus? ... SCENE THE FOURTH. David, Michal, Jonathan. Da. Thy spouse is at thy side. Mi. Oh voice! ... oh sight! ... I cannot speak for joy!âSupreme amazement! ... And is it true that I at last embrace thee? ... Da. Beloved wife! ... Hard has my absence been! ... Death, if I'm doom'd to meet with thee to-day, By all that love me, and by all I love, I am at least surrounded. Better die At once, than languish on in solitude A weary life, where thou by none art loved, And where thou lovest none. Thou thirsty sword Of Saul, I here expect thee; take my life; Here will my eyes at least be closed in death By my beloved wife; my limbs composed; And bathed by her with tears of real grief. Mi. My David! ... Thou at once the source and end Of all my hopes, ah may thy coming here To me be joyful! God, who rescued thee From such prodigious oft-repeated dangers, Restores thee not to us in vain to-day ... Oh, with what strength thy sight alone inspires me. So much I trembled for thee when remote, Almost I cease to tremble for thee now ... But what do I behold? In what uncouth And savage garment wrapt, the dawn of day Displays thee to my eyes? My long'd-for champion, How art thou stripp'd of every ornament? No more that robe of gilded purple shades Thy limbs majestic, which these hands of mine Embroider'd for thy use. So indigent, Who would suppose thou wert the monarch's son? Thou seem'st a vulgar warrior, and no more By thy accoutrements. Da. We are in the camp; Not in the centre of th'effeminate court: The rustic cassock, and the sharpen'd sword, Are most befitting here. I am resolved To-day once more in the Philistines' blood My garments to impurple. Thou, meanwhile, Rely with me on Israel's mighty God, Who from destruction can deliver me If I deserve not death. Jon. Behold, the day Is fully now reveal'd: to linger here Thou canst not with impunity persist. Although, perchance, thou comest opportunely, Still it behoves thee to advance with caution.â Each morn we are accustom'd at this hour To meet our father. We will scrutinize How he to-day is govern'd and possess'd By his distemper'd humour: by degrees We will prepare him, if occasion smiles, For thy reception; and will obviate, That no one first to him malignantly Report thy reappearance. Thou, meanwhile, Keep thyself separate, lest any one Should recognize thee here, and circumvent thee; And Abner even cause thee to be slain. Lower the visor of thy helmet; mix Among the undistinguish'd warriors, And, unobserved, await till I return To thee, or send for thee ... Mi. Among the warriors How can my David be conceal'd? What eye Darts from beneath the morion like his? Who wields a sword that may with his compare? And whose arms clang with such a martial sound? Ah no! my love, 'twere better thou wert hid Till I return to thee. Ah wretched me! Scarce found, must I surrender thee already? But only for an instant; after that, Never, no never, will I leave thee more. Yet first would I see thee conceal'd in safety. Behold! dost thou not see a spacious grot In the recesses of that gloomy wood? There oft have I invoked thee, from the world Retired, and sigh'd for thee, and thought on thee; There with my bitter tears have I bedew'd The rugged stones: in this conceal thyself, Till the fit time come for discovering thee. Da. In all things, Michal, I would yield to thee. Go in implicit trust: I am impell'd By a sure instinct, and at random act not; I love you both; for your sakes do I live; And in Jehovah only I confide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Saul, Abner. Sa. This dawn how splendid! Th'universal sun Arises not wrapt in a bloody shrowd; He seems to promise a propitious day.â Oh, my past years! where now are ye all fled? Saul never from his martial bed, till now, Rose in the camp, without the certain trust That, ere at eve his pillow he resumed, He should be victor. Ab. Wherefore now, oh king, Dost thou despair? Hast thou not heretofore Routed the squadrons of Philistia's host? Abner assures thee, that, as to this fight, Thou com'st more tardily, thence shalt thou reap From its result unprecedented fame. Sa. Oh, Abner, with what different eyes do youth And hoary age contemplate the events Of human life. When with a well-knit arm I grasp'd this ponderous and gnarled spear, Which now I scarcely sway, I ill conceived The possibility of self-mistrust ... But I have now not only lost my youth ... Ah! were th'invincible right-hand of God E'en yet with me! ... or were with me at least David, my champion! ... Ab. What then are we? Perhaps without him we no longer conquer? If I thought that, I never would unsheathe My sword again, except to pierce my heart. David, who is the first and only cause Of all thy misadventures ... Sa. Thou'rt deceived.â All my calamities may be referr'd To a more terrible cause ... And what? Would'st thou Conceal from me the horror of my state? Ah! were I not a father, as I am, Alas! too certainly, of much-loved children, ... Would I have now life, victory, or the throne? ... I should already, and a long time since, Headlong have cast myself 'mid hostile swords: I should already, thus at least, at once Have closed the horrible life that I drag on. How many years have now past, since a smile Was seen to play upon my lips? My children, Whom still I love so much, if they caress me, For the most part inflame my heart to rage ... Impatient, fierce, incensed, and turbulent, I am a burthen to myself and others; In peace I wish for war, in war for peace: Poison conceal'd I drink in every cup, In every friend I see an enemy; The softest carpets of Assyria seem Planted with thorns to my unsolaced limbs; My transient sleep is agonized with fear; Each dream with imaged terrors that distract me. Why should I add to this dark catalogue? Who would believe it? The sonorous trumpet Speaks to my ears in an appalling voice; And fills the heart of Saul with deep dismay. Thou seest clearly that Saul's tottering house Is desolate, bereft of all its splendour; Thou seest that God hath cast me off for ever. And thou thyself (too well thou know'st the truth) Dost sometimes, as thou art, appear to me My kinsman, champion, and my real friend, The leader of my armies, the support Of my renown; and sometimes dost appear The interested minion of a court, Hostile, invidious, crafty, and a traitor. Ab. Now, Saul, that thou hast thus regain'd thy reason, Do thou, I pray thee, to thy mind recall Each past transaction! Art thou not aware That all the wounds of thy afflicted heart From Rama spring; yea, from the dwelling spring Of Rama's many prophets. Who to thee First dared to say, that God had cast thee off? Th'audacious, turbulent, and crafty seer, Th'ambitious, doting priest, whose palsying words His scycophantic worshippers repeat. The royal wreath, which he thought his, he saw With jealous eyes glittering upon thy brows. Already he accounted it entwined Around his hoary locks; when lo! the voice, Th'unanimous, acclamatory voice, Of Israel's people, to the wind dispersed His wishes, and a warrior king preferred. This is thy crime, this only. Hence, when thou Ceasedst to be subordinate to him, He ceased to call thee the elect of God. This, this alone at first disturb'd thy reason; And David's hierophantic eloquence The injury completed. He in arms Was valiant, I deny it not; but still He was implicitly the tool of Samuel, And fitter for the altar than the camp: In arm a warrior, but in heart a priest. Of every adventitious ornament Be truth divested; thou dost know the truth. I from thy blood am sprung; what constitutes Thy glory, constitutes my glory too: But David, no, can never raise himself, If first he tread not Saul beneath his feet. Sa. David? ... I hate him ... But yet I to him Have yielded as a consort my own daughter ... Ah! thou canst never know.âThat self-same voice, Imperative and visionary voice, Which as a youth my nightly slumbers broke, When I in privacy obscurely lived Far from the throne, and all aspiring thoughts, For sundry nights hath that same voice been heard In menacing, denunciatory tones; Like the deep murmur of the stormy waves, Thundering repulsively, to me it cried,â âDepart, depart, oh Saul.â ... The sacred aspect, The venerable aspect of the prophet, Which I had seen in dreams before he had Made manifest that God had chosen me For Israel's king, that Samuel, in a dream, Now with far different aspect I behold. I, from a hollow, deep, and horrible vale, Behold him sitting on a radiant mount: David is humbly prostrate at his feet: The holy prophet on his forehead pours The consecrated oil: with th'other hand Stretch'd to my head, a hundred cubits length, He snatches from my brow the royal crown, And would replace it on the brow of David: But, would'st thou think it? David prostrate falls, With piteous gesture, at the prophet's feet, Refusing to receive it; and he weeps, And cries, and intercedes so fervently, That he refits it on my head at last ... âOh spectacle!âOh David, generous David! Then thou art yet obedient to thy king? My son? my faithful subject? and my friend? ... Distraction! ... Would'st thou take from me my crown? Thou, who dared'st do it, insolent old man, Tremble ... Who art thou? ... Let him die at once Who e'en conceived the thought.âAlas, alas! I rave like one distracted! ... Ab. Let him die; Let David die alone: and with him vanish Dreams, terrors, omens, and distresses. SCENE THE SECOND. Jonathan, Michal, Saul, Abner. Jon. Peace Be with my king. Mi. And God be with my father. Sa. Grief always is with me.âI rose to-day Before my custom'd hour, in joyful hope ... But, like a vapour of the desert, hope Hath disappear'd already.âOh my son, What boots it now the battle to defer? To dread defeat is worse than to endure it. And let us once endure it:âLet us fight To-day; I will it. Jon. We to-day shall conquer. Father, resume thy hopes: hope never shone With more authentic brightness on thy prospects. Ah, recompose thy looks! my heart is big With presages of victory. All this plain Shall with the bodies of our foes be cover'd; And to the ravenous vultures will we leave A horrid banquet ... Mi. To a calmer spot Within thy palace we will soon repair, Oh father. There, amid thy palms enthroned, Joyful thyself, thou, by restoring to her Her much-loved husband, wilt restore to life Thy desolate daughter ... Sa. ... Evermore in tears? ... Are these, indeed, the pleasing objects doom'd To renovate Saul's languid, wither'd mind? Art thou a solace thus to my just grief? Daughter of tears, depart; go; leave me; vanish. Mi. Alas! ... Thou would'st not, father, that I wept? ... Father, and who in everlasting tears Now keeps me, if not thou? Jon. Refrain; would'st thou Be irksome to thy father?âSaul, take comfort: A minister of war and victory Stands in the camp; a spirit of salvation, With dawning light descended from the skies, Which o'er all Israel's host will spread to-day His brooding wings. A certainty of conquest, E'en to thy heart, will quickly circulate. Sa. Now, perhaps, thou would'st that I should take a part In thy weak transports? I?âWhat victory? What spirit comes? ... Let us all weep. To-day That venerable oak, torn up, will shew Its squalid roots, where heretofore it spread Its stately branches to the gales of Heaven. All, all is weeping, tempest, blood, and death. Rend, rend your garments; scatter on your hair Polluting dust. Yes, this day is the last; To us the final day. Ab. Oft have I said it: Your importuning presence evermore Redoubles his fierce pangs. Mi. And what? Must we Leave our beloved father? Jon. At his side Presumest thou alone to stand? Dost thou Presume that in thy hands? ... Sa. What, what is this? Rage sits upon the faces of my sons. Who, who has wrong'd them? Abner, thou perchance? These are my blood; dost not know that? ... Remember ... Jon. Ah yes! we are thy blood; and for thy sake Hold ourselves ready all our blood to shed ... Mi. When at thy hands my consort I require, Am I by selfish love alone impell'd? I ask of thee the champion of thy people, The terror of Philistia, thy defender. In thy disconsolate fantastic hours, And in thy fatal presages of death, Ah! did not David sometimes solace thee With his celestial music? Was not he A beam of joy to thy benighted soul? Jon. And I, thou knowest if I wear a sword. But what boots that, if the resounding steps Of Israel's warrior to my steps give not The law supreme? Should we of fighting speak Were David here? We had already conquer'd. Sa. Oh times long past! ... Oh my illustrious days Of joyful victory! ... Lo! they throng before meâ Triumphant images of past success. I from the camp return, with bloody sweat All cover'd, and with honourable dust. And praises to the Lord ... I praise the Lord! The ears of God are deafen'd to my voice; Mute is my lip ... Where is my glory, where? Where is the blood of my slain enemies? Jon. Thou would'st have all in David ... Mi. But with thee David is not, oh no: to banishment Thou drov'st him from thy presence, sought'st his death ... David, thy son, thy noblest ornament, Modest and docile; more than lightning swift To obey thee; and in loving thee more warm Than thy own children. Father, ah! desist ... Sa. Tears from my eyes are gushing! Who hath thus Forced me to unaccustom'd tenderness? ... Compel me not to weep. Ab. I counsel thee, Oh king, withdraw from hence to thy pavilion. Thy marshall'd forces, ready for the combat, Ere long I will display to thee.âNow come; And be convinced that nothing is in David ... SCENE THE THIRD. David, Saul, Abner, Jonathan, Michal. Da. ... Except his innocence. Sa. What do I see? Mi. Oh heaven! Jon. What hast thou done? Ab. Audacious ... Jon. Father ... Mi. Father, he is my spouse; to me thou gav'st him. Sa. Oh what a sight is this! Da. Oh Saul, my king; Thou dost demand this head; for a long time Already hast thou sought it; here it is; Sever it now ... 'tis thine. Sa. What do I hear? Oh David ... David! God doth speak in thee. A God to-day hither hath brought thee to me ... Da. Yes, monarch; he who is the God alone; He who in Ela prompted me to meet, Although a stripling and yet inexpert, The menacing colossal arrogance Of fierce Goliah, clad in complete mail: That God who thence on thy tremendous arms Heap'd victory on victory; and who, In his designs always inscrutable, Chose, as an instrument, my obscure hand For signal exploits: hither now that God Doth usher me to thee with victory, Now as thou likest best, a simple warrior, Or leader of thy bands, if I deserve Such a distinction, take me. On the earth First let thy foes be strewn: by the keen breath Of northern blasts be all the clouds dispersed That gather round thy intercepted throne: Then shalt thou afterwards with death reward me. Nor one faint struggle, nor a single thought, Should my death cost thee. Thou, oh king, shalt say, âBe David slain;â and Abner instantly Shall slay me.âI will grasp nor sword nor shield; Within the palace of my absolute lord All weapons misbecome me except patience, Humility, and prayers, and passive love, And innocence. I ought, if God so will, Die as thy son, not as thy enemy. Thus was the son of the first ancestor Of Israel's people ready to resign, On the great mount, his sacrificial blood; Nor did a gesture or a word escape Belying perfect passiveness in him: Already had his father raised one hand To slay him, while he fondly kiss'd the other.â Saul gave my life; Saul takes that life away: Through him I gain'd renown; through him I lose it: He made me great, and now he makes me nothing. Sa. Oh, what a thick mist from my aged eyes Those words disperse! What voice sounds in my heart? David, thou speakest as a man of valour, And valiant were thy deeds; but, blind with pride, Thou dar'dst despise me afterwards; dar'dst raise Thyself above me; to my praise pretend, And clothe thyself with my reflected light. And, were I not thy king, does it become A warrior, entering on the paths of fame, His hoary predecessor to despise? Thou, great in all things, wert not so in this. Of thee the daughters of my people sung: âDavid the valiant, his ten thousands slew; âSaul slew his thousands.â To my inmost heart, David, thou woundedst me. Why saidst thou not, âSaul in his youth not only slew a thousand, âBut thousand thousands: he the warrior is; âMe he created.â Da. I indeed said this; But those who to thy hearing gain'd access, More loudly cried: âToo powerful David is: âIn all men's mouths, and in the hearts of many; âIf thou, Saul, slay him not, who will restrain him?â With less of art, and more of verity, What said not Abner to the king? âAh, David âToo much surpasses me; hence I abhor him; âHence envy, fear him; hence I wish him dead.â Ab. Miscreant! the day that thou clandestinely Didst with thy prophets trait'rously cabal; When for thy monarch thou didst spread in secret Infamous snares; when shelter thou didst seek E'en in the bosom of Philistia's sons; And with impure foes spending days profane, Didst meanwhile with domestic traitors hold A secret commerce: now do I perchance Only allege this? or didst thou not do it? At first, who more install'd thee than myself Within thy monarch's heart? Who prompted him To give thee Michal? Abner ... he alone ... Mi. 'Twas I, I at my father's hand obtain'd David as consort; his I sought to be; I, smitten by his virtue. He inspired My earliest sighs; the idol of my heart, My hope, my life he was, and he alone. Although disguised in base obscurity, Reduced to poverty, yet evermore David had been more welcome to my heart Than any proud king whom the east adores. Sa. But thou, oh David, canst thou controvert The charges Abner brings? Didst thou not seek A shelter in Philistia? Didst thou not Sow in my people seeds of black revolt? Hast thou not plotted many times to take Thy monarch's life, thy sacred father's life? Da. Behold; this border of thy royal garment Answers for me. Dost recognize it, thou? Take it; examine it. Sa. Give it to me. What do I see? 'Tis mine; assuredly ... Whence didst thou take it? ... Da. From thyself I took it, With this my sword, from off thy royal robe, My own hands severed it.âRemember'st thou En-gedi? There, where barbarously thou Pursuedst me, a banish'd man, to death; There was I, in the cave, that from the fount Derives its name, a friendless fugitive: There, thou alone, thy warriors having station'd To guard the abrupt entrance of the cave, On downy pillows, in calm quietness, Didst close thine eyes in sleep ... Yes, thou, oh heaven, With rancorous and with bloody thoughts inflamed, Didst slumber there! Thou seest how mighty God Defeats the schemes of human subtlety! There with impunity I might have slain thee, And by another issue have escaped. This border of thy robe sufficiently Proves this. Behold thee, thou a king, A haughty and a great one, in the midst Of arm'd battalions, fallen in the hands Of the proscribed calumniated youth ... Abner, the valiant Abner, where was he? ... Thus does he guard thy life! Thus serve his king! Thou seest in whom thou hast reposed thy trust; On whom thou hast thy indignation wreak'd.â Now art thou satisfied? Now hast thou not, Saul, of my heart proofs incontestable, Of my fidelity and innocence? Not proofs persuasive of the little love, Of the malignant and invidious rage, And the precarious vigilance of Abner? Sa. My son, thou hast conquer'd; ... thou hast wholly conquer'd. Abner, do thou behold him, and be dumb. Mi. Oh joy! ... Da. Oh father! ... Jo. Oh auspicious day! Mi. My husband! ... Sa. Yes, this is a day of joy, A day of restitution and of triumph. I will that thou to-day command my armies: Abner oppose not; since I will it so. Let no contention 'twixt you two arise, Except an emulation which shall slay Most of Saul's enemies. Thou, Jonathan, Beside the brother of thy heart shalt fight: David to me is surety for thy life; And thou art so for his. Jo. When David leads Our armies, God himself becomes our surety. Mi. May God restore thee to me; he will save thee ... Sa. Let this suffice. Before the fight begins Come to the tent, oh son, a little while, And rest thy wearied limbs. Thy spouse beloved Shall sooth the long affliction of thy absence. With her own hands meanwhile shall she provide And minister thy food. Daughter, do thou Repair in part (for thou alone canst do it) The involuntary errors of thy father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. David, Abner. Ab. Behold me: at thy summons I appear Ere scarce the king hath from the banquet risen. Da. I wish'd to speak to thee in secret here. Ab. Thou would'st perchance hear of the approaching fight? ... Da. And at the same time say, that thou art not Subordinate to me; that both alike Our people and our lawful king we serve, And Israel's mighty God. Let not our breasts Harbour another thought. Ab. I for our king, From whose blood I descend, had in the camp Already brandish'd my ensanguined sword Before the shrill twang of thy sling was heard. Da. The monarch's blood runs not within my veins: To all my deeds are known; I boast them not; Abner, thou know'st them.âIn forgetfulness Let them be buried: only recollect Thine own; and, emulous of thy former fame, Seek only to surpass thyself to-day. Ab. I hitherto believed myself the leader: David was not here then; I ventured hence To order all things for the victory: Hear what I should have done had I commanded.â Full in our front, from north to south, the camp Of the Philistines fills the valley's length. Behind it rise thick bushes; 'tis defended By lofty banks in front: eastward 'tis flank'd By a not lofty hill, of gentle slope Towards the camp, but rough, precipitous, On the opposite descent; an ample outlet Lies amid mountains to the west, through which By a vast plain the traveller may go, Exempt from hindrance, to the murmuring ocean. Here, if we thither can decoy our foes, The victory will be ours. But, to accomplish that, 'tis needful first To feign retreat. In three battalions form'd, If we towards the valley's left side bend, We shall in front encounter their right flank. The first battalion with forced march advances, And seems to fly; the second, more supine, Remains behind, in thin, disorder'd ranks, A sure temptation to our enemies. Meanwhile, a band conspicuous for its valour The rugged hill towards the east has gain'd, And on the rear of the invading host Reissues. Thus in front is it enclosed, Behind, transversely; and behold we make Of it, a dreadful, universal carnage. Da. Equally wise and valorous art thou. And nothing, Abner, should we dare to change Of thy design. Valour, wherever found, Obtains my praise. A soldier I will be, And not a leader: and my coming here Shall, by the addition of a sword alone, Alter thy battle. Ab. David is the leader; David is master of our armies. Who Combats, compared with him? Da. Who less indeed Should stoop to jealousy than Abner, since He is so highly gifted? Excellent, However I behold it, is thy scheme. Myself and Jonathan beside the tent Of Saul shall combat; further, towards the north, Uz shall advance; with thousand chosen men Sadoc the eastern eminence shall gain; And thou, with greatest numbers, shall command The body of the army. Ab. This to thee Belongs: it is the place of honour. Da. Hence I place thee there.âAs yet the sun ascends: Thou shalt keep all in steady preparation; But till the fourth hour of the afternoon Be not the trumpets heard. Perceiv'st thou not A violent west wind blows; the dazzling sun And driven dust will, towards the close of day, Assist our enterprize. Ab. Thou speakest wisely. Da. Now go, command, and do not from thyself, With base and courtly artifice, of which Thou should'st be ignorant, avert that praise, Which, as a captain, thou so well deservest. SCENE THE SECOND. David. Da. The order of the fight is wise and subtle.â But if he have not gain'd his soldier's hearts, What boots the forecast of a general? Of this alone is Abner destitute; And this God grants to me. To-day we conquer; To-morrow once more do I leave the king; For never in his sight can there be peace, For me ... What do I say? New victory Would be ascribed to me as a new crime. SCENE THE THIRD. Michal, David. Mi. David, hast thou not heard? My father scarce Rose from a joyous banquet, when towards him Abner advanced, and spake to him an instant. I enter'd, he retired; I found the king No longer what he was. Da. But yet, what said he? What couldest thou infer? ... Mi. Erewhile was he Devoted to our cause; with us he wept; Alternately embraced us; and from us, As if in his defence, he prophesied A race of future heroes. He appear'd To us, as he said this, more than a father; More than a king he now appears to me. Da. Ah! do not weep, oh wife, before thy time: Saul is our king; his will in us must be Accomplish'd. So that he to-day obtain The battle, let him 'gainst myself to-morrow Resume his cruel thoughts: I will resume My abject state, my bitter banishment, My fugitive and apprehensive life. My true and only death is thus to leave thee: And yet I ought to do it ... Ah vain hopes! Ah nuptial ties for thee how inauspicious! Another consort, that of which I rob thee, To thee had given, a prosperous royal state. Wretch that I am! ... Nor canst thou ever make me, (Thy ever fugitive and homeless consort,) The father of a numerous blooming offspring. Mi. Ah no! we never shall again be parted: No one will dare to rend thee from my breast. I never shall return, no, never more, To that disconsolate life which I dragg'd on Deprived of thee: rather than so return May I become an inmate of the grave. I languish'd in that palace of despair, Alone and weeping, through the tedious days; The shades of night with horrible dreams were fraught. Now I beheld my cruel father's sword Suspended o'er thy head; thy voice I heard Persuasive, weeping, supplicating, such As might from breasts of adamant dislodge Deep-rooted hate and fell obduracy; And yet the barbarous Saul, in spite of this, Plunged in thy heart the dagger. Now I saw thee 'Mid secret labyrinths of low-brow'd caves, Pillowing thy body on unyielding flint; While at the motion of a rustling leaf Thy faint heart trembled; and thou sought'st another, And thence another, yet in vain to find A place of rest, or quietness, or friends: Sick, anxious, weary ... worn with parching thirst ... And ravening hunger ... Can I represent My pangs, my apprehensions, and my woes?â No more, no, never will I leave thee, never. Da. Thou torturest my heart: ah cease: ... This day Is consecrated to blood, and not to tears. Mi. Provided that an obstacle to-day Arise not to thy fighting, I fear not The fight on thy account. Thou hast a shield Proof against all assaults, Almighty God: But I am fearful lest perfidious Abner, On thy account, frustrate, or intercept The victory to-day. Da. And what, did Saul Seem to thee doubtfully to trust to me To-day the conduct of the enterprize? Mi. I heard not that; but sternly did he frown, And whisper'd to himself I know not what Of trait'rous priests, of strangers in the camp, Of simulated virtue ... Broken, dark, Mournful, tremendous words, to her who is The wife of David and the child of Saul. Da. See him: we will be heard. Mi. Just God, I pray thee, Succour to-day thy consecrated servant: Confound blasphemers; reillumine my father; Protect my husband; and defend thy people. SCENE THE FOURTH. Saul, Jonathan, David, Michal. Jon. Ah come, beloved father; to thy thoughts Allow a little respite: the pure air Will bring thee some refreshment; come, and sit A little while among thy children here. Sa. What is it that you say? Mi. Beloved father! ... Sa. Who, who are ye? ... Who speaks of pure air here? ... This! ... 'tis a thick impenetrable gloom; A land of darkness; and the shades of death ... Ah see! more nearly it approaches me? ... A fatal wreath of blood surrounds the sun ... Heard'st thou the death-notes of ill-omen'd birds With loud laments the vocal air resounds That smite my ears, compelling me to weep. But what, do ye weep also? ... Jon. Mighty God Of Israel, dost thou thus thy face avert From wretched Saul? Is he, thy servant once, Abandon'd to the adversary thus? Mi. Father, thy much-loved daughter is beside thee. If thou art cheerful, she is also cheerful; She, if thou weepest, weeps ... But wherefore now Should we shed tears? Pleasure hath reappeared. Sa. Thou would'st say, David. Ah! ... Why doth not he Also embrace me with my other children? Da. Oh father! ... I have been restrain'd by fear Of importuning thee. Ah! why canst thou Not read my heart? I evermore am thine. Sa. Thou lovest then ... the house ... of Saul? Da. I love it! Oh heaven! Dear as the apple of mine eye To me is Jonathan; I neither know, Nor heed a peril in the world for thee; Let my wife, if she can, say with what love, And how much love, I love her. Sa. Yet thyself Thou mightily dost prize. Da. I, prize myself ... No despicable soldier in the camp, In court thy son-in-law, I deem myself; But nothing, nothing in the sight of God. Sa. Incessantly to me of God thou speakest; Yet thou well knowest that the crafty rage, Cruel, tremendous, of perfidious priests, Has for a long time sever'd me from God. Dost thou thus name him to insult me? Da. I Name him, to give him glory. Why dost thou Believe that he no longer is with thee? He doth not dwell with him who loves him not: But doth he ever fail to succour him Who oft invokes him, and who hath reposed In him implicit trust? He to the throne Appointed thee; and on that throne he keeps thee: And if in him, in him exclusively Thou dost confide, he's thine, and thou art his. Sa. Who speaks of heaven? ... Is he in snowy vest Enrobed who thus his sacred lip unseals? Let us behold him ... Thou'rt a warrior; thou Graspest the sword: ... approach, and let me see If David thus or Samuel doth accost me.â What sword is this? 'Tis not the same, methinks, Which I, with my own hands, on thee bestow'd. Da. This is the sword that my poor sling acquired; The sword that over me in Elah hung Threatening my life; in fierce Goliah's hands I saw it flash a horrid glare of death Before my eyes; he grasp'd it; but it bears Not mine, but his coagulated blood. Sa. Was not that sword, a consecrated thing, In Nob, within the tabernacle hung? Was it not wrapp'd within the mystic Ephod, And thus from all unhallow'd eyes conceal'd, Devoted to the Lord of hosts for ever? Da. 'Tis true; but ... Sa. Whence didst thou obtain it then? Who dared to give it thee? Da. I will confess. Powerless and fugitive to Nob I came: Wherefore I fled thou knowest. Every path Was crowded with unhappy wretches; I, Defenceless, found myself at every step Within the jaws of death. With humble brow I kneel'd within the tabernacle, where The spirit of God descends: and there, these arms (Which if a living man might to his side Refit them, David surely was that man) Myself demanded of the priest. Sa. And he ... Da. Gave them to me. Sa. He was ... Da. Ahimeleoh. Sa. Perfidious traitor! ... Vile! ... Where is the altar? ... Oh rage ... Ah, all are miscreants! traitors all! ... Oh foes to God! are ye his ministers? ... Black souls in vestments white! ... Where is the axe? Where is the altar? ... Let him be destroy'd! ... Where is the offering? ... I myself will slay him. Mi. Father! Jon. What mean these words? Where dost thou fly? Be pacified, I pray thee: there are not Or altars here or victims: in the priests Respect that God who hears thee evermore. Sa. Who thus restrains me? Who resists me thus? Who forces me to sit? Jon. Father ... Da. Ah thou, Great God of Israel, do thou succour him: Thy servant kneels to thee, and prays for this. Sa. I am bereft of peace: the sun, the earth, My children, and my power of thought, all, all Are taken from me! ... Ah unhappy Saul! Who doth console thee? Who is now the guide, The prop of thy bewilder'd feebleness? Thy children are all mute; they scowl on thee ... And of the doting and infirm old man They only wish the death: nothing attracts My children's wishes but the diadem, Whose weight thy hoary head but ill sustains. Wrest it at once: and at the same time sever From this now tremulous and decaying form Your father's palsied head ... Ah wretched state! Better were death! I wish to die! ... Mi. Oh father! We all desire thy life. We each of us Would die ourselves to rescue thee from death. Jon. Now since in tears his fury is dissolved, Brother, do thou, to recompose his soul, Exert thy voice. So many times already Hast thou rapt him with thy celestial songs In calm oblivion. Mi. Yes; thou seest now The respiration in his panting breast Almost subsides: his eye-balls, late so fierce, So hot and dry, swim in balsamic tears: Now is the time to lend him thy assistance. Da. May God in mercy speak to him through me. 1. Omnipotent, eternal, infinite, Thou who dost govern each created thing; Thou, who from nothing mad'st me by thy might, Blest with a soul that dares to thee take wing; Thou who canst pierce the abyss of endless night, And all its mysteries into day-light bring; The universe doth tremble at thy nod, And sinners prostrate fall at the out-stretch'd arm of God. 2. Oft on the gorgeous blazing wings ere now Of thousand cherubim wert thou reveal'd; Oft did thy pure divinity endow Thy people's shepherd in the martial field. To him a stream of eloquence wert thou; Thou wert his sword, his wisdom, and his shield. From thy bright throne, oh God, bestow one ray To cleave the gathering clouds that intercept the day. 3. In tears and darkness we ... Sa. Hear I the voice Of David? ... From a mortal lethargy It seems to wake me, and to me displays The cheering radiance of my early years. David. 1. âWho comes, who comes, unseen, yet heard? âA sable cloud of dust appear'd, âDriven by the eastern blast.â âBut it is burst; and from its womb âA thousand brandish'd swords illume âThe track through which it past. 2. âSaul, as a tower, his forehead rears, âHis head a flaming circlet wears; âThe earth beneath his feet âEchoes with tramp of horse and men; âThe sea, the sky, the hills, the plain, âThe warlike sounds repeat. âIn awful majesty doth Saul appear; âHorsemen and chariots from before him fly; âChill'd by his presence is each heart with fear; âAnd god-like terrors lighten in his eye. 1. âYe sons of Ammon, late so proud, âWhere is the scorn, the insults loud, âYe raised against our host? âYour corses more than fill the plain; âThe ample harvest of your slain âInvalidates your boast. 2. âSee what it is thus to depend âOn gods unable to defend.â âBut wherefore from afar âHear I another trumpet sound? â'Tis Saul's:âhe levels with the ground âAll Edom's sons of war. âThus Moab, Soba, by his arms laid low, âWith impious Amalek, united fall: âSaul, like a stream fed by dissolving snow, âDefeats, disperses, overwhelms them all.â Sa. This is the voice of my departed years, That from the tomb to glory now recalls me. I live again in my victorious youth When I hear this ... What do I say? Alas! ... Should cries of war be now address'd to me? Oblivion, indolence, and peace, invite The old man to themselves. Da. Let peace be sung. âWeary and thirsty, see he lies âBeside his native stream; âGod's champion, whose past victories âWake many a glorious dream. âThe glossy laurel's evergreen âDoth screen his head from heat; âHis children all around him seen, âHis sighs and smiles repeat. âThey weep and smile, then smile and weep, âWith sympathy endued; âAnd still a strict accordance keep âTo every varying mood. âHis daughter's gentle hand unfits âHis crested helm and sword; âHis consort fond beside him sits, âEmbracing her loved lord. âAnother doth clear water bring âFrom the pure ambient flood, âTo cleanse his stately brows, where cling âCommingled dust and blood. âA cloud of odorous flowers she spreads, âWhich breathe their perfumes near; âAnd on his honour'd hand she sheds âThe duteous filial tear. âBut why sits one apart reclined, âIn pensive mood alone? âAlas, she mourns that others find âA task, while she has none. âBut different thoughts, with eager haste, âAttract the band of boys; âTill his turn comes to be embraced, âOne son himself employs âTo make the blood-encrusted blade âFrom spot and blemish clear: âWith envy fired, another said, ââWhen shall I poise that spear? ââThat ponderous lance when shall I wield, ââThat now defies my strength?â âAnother grasps the blazon'd shield, âAnd stalks behind its length.â âTears of sweet surprise, âFrom forth the swimming eyes âOf Saul are seen to roll: âFor of his blooming race, âSo full of royal grace, âHe knows that he's the soul. âThe pleasure how entire, âHow happy is the sire, âWhose waking thoughts inspire âAffections so sincere!â âBut now the day is o'er, âThe zephyrs breathe no more; âAnd sleep's soft powers restore âThe monarch we revere.â Sa. Happy the father of a race like this! Oh peace of mind! ... how precious are thy gifts To wretches like myself by thee deserted! ... I feel ineffably through all my veins Balsamic dews of sweet composure steal ... But what pretendest thou? To make Saul vile Amid domestic ease? Does valiant Saul Now lie an useless implement of war? David. âThe king reposes, but heroic dreams âWith fearful majesty before him glance, âPregnant with death and visionary themes. âBehold, transfix'd with his victorious lance, âThe conquer'd tyrant of the haughty foes; âAn awful shade in spectral gloom advance. âBehold a flash that instantaneous glows ... âIt is Saul's brandish'd sword, that no man spares, âThe weak and strong confounding with its blows.â âThe terrible lion thus sometimes forbears âTo make the forest with his cries resound, âFor even he in sleep his strength repairs; âBut not the silence of his den profound, âCan courage to the afflicted flocks restore; âOr make the swain with less fear look around, âFor well he knows that he will prowl once more. âThe monarch is roused from his slumbers, âArms, arms, he imperiously cries. âThey are vanish'dâthe enemies numbers; âWhat champion his valour defies? âI see, I see a track of terrible fire, âTo which perforce the hostile squadrons yield. âBefore the arms of Israel they retire, âWhich, black with hostile gore, possess the field. âThe winged thunderbolt huge stones doth shower, âAnd far less promptly doth the foe retreat âThan our dread sovereign in his mighty power âPursue him, and his overthrow complete. âLike a proud eagle, his audacious flight, âImpt with immortal wings, towards the pole âHe aims. His eyes are like the lightning bright; âHis talons God's own thunderbolts controul, âTo annihilate those impious sons of earth, âWho in false temples have false gods adored; âWhose impure gods to impure rites gave birth, âWho dare compare themselves with Israel's Lord. âLong, long have I pursued his ardent path; âNow it behoves me once more to pursue âHis foes on earth; with heaven-directed wrath âTo trample down and crush Philistia's crew; âAnd with the assistance of the God of hosts, âProve that, as he, so I maintain his laws; âAnd prove that now the camp of Israel boasts âTwo swords resistless in a righteous cause.â Sa. Who, who thus boasts? Is there, except my sword, Which I unsheathe, another in the camp? He's a blasphemer, let him perish, he Who dares defy it. Mi. Ah forbear: Oh heaven! ... Jon. Father, what would'st thou do? Da. Unhappy king! Mi. Ah fly! ... Ah fly! With difficulty we From violence restrain him. SCENE THE FIFTH. Jonathan, Saul, Michal. Mi. Stop, oh stop, Beloved father! Jon. I beseech thee stop. Sa. Who thus restrains me? Who presumes to do it? ... Where is my sword? Restore my sword at once ... Jon. Do thou retire with us, beloved father: I shall not suffer thee to advance a step. Behold, thy children now are all alone: Return with us to thy pavilion; now Thou needest quietness. Ah come! ... Refrain From causeless rage; thy children stand around thee. Mi. And they shall never, never quit thy presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Jonathan, Michal. Mi. Jonathan, tell me; to my father's tent May David now return? Jon. Ah no! with him Saul is not reconciled, although he have Regain'd his reason; but fell jealousy Hath round his heart too intricately twined Her blighting fibres; slow will be his cure. Return to David thou, and leave him not. Mi. Alas! ... Who is more wretched than myself? I have so well conceal'd him, that no man Will ever find him: to this hiding-place I now return to him. Jon. Oh heaven! behold My poor distracted father once more comes: He never finds a resting-place. Mi. Ah me ... What shall I say to him? ... I will retire ... SCENE THE SECOND. Saul, Michal, Jonathan. Sa. Who flies at my approach? Thou, Michal, thou? Mi. My lord ... Sa. Where, where is David? Mi. ... I know not ... Jon. Oh father! ... Sa. Seek him then; Go, bring him hither quickly. Mi. I pursue him? ... Whither ... ah ... whither? Sa. 'Twas thy king that spake, And hast thou not obey'd him? SCENE THE THIRD. Saul, Jonathan. Sa. Jonathan, Lov'st thou thy father? Jon. Father, yes, I love thee: But, loving thee, I also love thy glory: Hence sometimes I oppose, far as a son Ought to oppose them, thy unjust desires. Sa. Often thy father's arm dost thou restrain: But thou dost turn against thyself that sword Which thou avertest from another's breast. Yes, yes, defend that David to the utmost; Shortly will he ... Dost thou not hear a voice That in thy heart cries, âDavid will be king!â âDavid!âHe shall be immolated first. Jon. And doth not God, with a more terrible voice, Cry in thy heart, âDavid is my beloved! âHe is the chosen of the Lord of hosts?â Doth not each act of his confirm this truth? Was not the frantic and invidious rage Of Abner silenced by his mere approach? And thou, when thou re-enterest in thyself, Dost thou not find that, only at his presence, All thy suspicions vanish like a cloud Before the sun? And dost thou fondly dream, When the malignant spirit visits thee, That I restrain thy arm? Thy God restrains it. Scarcely wilt thou have levell'd at his breast The misadventurous sword, when thou wilt be Forced to withdraw it suddenly: in tears Thou thyself prostrate at his feet wilt fall; Yes, father, thou repentant: for thou art Not impious ... Sa. But too, too true thy words. A strange inexplicable mystery This David is to me. No sooner I In Elah had beheld him than he pleased My eyes; but never, never won my heart. When I might almost be disposed to love him, A fierce repulsion shoots athwart my breast, And weans me from him. Scarcely do I wish, Scarcely resolve his death, than, if I see him, Me he disarms, and with such wonder fills me, That in his presence I become a nothing ... Ah! this is surely, this the vengeance is Of the inscrutable almighty hand! Tremendous hand! I now begin to know thee ... But what, why should I needlessly explain Common events by superhuman causes? God have I ne'er offended: this is then The vengeance of the priests. Yes, David is An instrument of sacerdotal malice. Expiring Samuel he beheld in Rama: The implacable old man to him address'd His dying words. Who knows, who knows if he Upon the head of this my enemy Pour'd not the sacred oil with which before My brows he had anointed? Perhaps thou knowest ... Speak ... yes, thou knowest: ... I conjure thee, speak. Jon. Father, I know not: but if it were so, Should not I, equally with thee, esteem Myself in this offended? Am not I Thy eldest son? Dost thou not mean this throne For me, when thou art gathered to thy fathers? If I then do not do it, who should dare To make complaints at this? In fortitude David surpasses me; in virtue, sense, In every quality: and as the more His worth surpasses mine, the more I love him. Now, should that power that gives and takes away Kingdoms at will, bestow this throne on David, What more conciliatory evidence Of heaven's interposition can I ask? He is more worthy of that throne than I: And God hath summon'd him to lofty deeds, The shepherd of his people.âBut meanwhile I swear, that he has always been to thee A faithful subject and a loyal son. Now to that God to whom it doth belong, The future yield: and against God, meanwhile, Against the truth, ah, harden not thy heart. If a divinity in Samuel spake not, How could an undesigning, weak old man, Half in the grave already, such effects Produce by David's means? That mystery Of love and hatred which thou feel'st for David; That apprehension at a battle's name, (A terror hitherto to thee unknown,) Whence, Saul, can it proceed? Is there a power On earth producing such effects as these? ... Sa. What language dost thou hold? A son of Saul Art thou?âFeel'st thou no interest for the throne?â Foresee'st thou not the cruel stratagems By which the usurper will defend his claim? My house will be abolish'd, from the roots Torn up, by him who seizes on my sceptre. Thy sons, thy brothers, and thyself destroy'd ... Not one of Saul's descendants will remain ... Oh guilty and insatiable thirst Of power, what horrors can'st thou not produce? To reign, the brother immolates the brother; Mothers their children; wives their consorts slay; The son his father ... Sacrilegious throne! Thou art the seat of blood and cruelty! Jon. Has man a shield against the sword of heaven? Not menaces or prayers can turn aside The wrath of God omnipotent, who oft The proud abases, and exalts the humble. SCENE THE FOURTH. Saul, Jonathan, Abner, Ahimelech, Soldiers. Ab. King, if thy presence I behold once more, Ere streams of hostile blood by my means flow, To this by mighty reasons am I urged. David, the champion, the invincible, He who our victory or defeat decides, David is fled, and none knows whither fled. Scarce is an hour now wanting to the time Appointed for attack: now, hear'st thou not The warriors, chafing with impatient ardour, Fill with loud cries the air; the earth resound, Beaten with iron hoof of fiery steeds: Howlings and neighings, and the blaze of helms, And brandish'd swords, and fulminating shouts, Enough to make the veriest coward valiant; Yet who sees David? Who brings tidings of him?â Behold, (the authentic succour of the Almighty!) Behold, who in the camp stands in his place. This man, in soft, white, sacerdotal stole Enveloped, having gain'd the camp by stealth, Tremblingly slunk beside the Benjamites, Behold him; hear from him the lofty cause Which to such peril guides him. Ahi. I will speak it, If not forbidden by the king's displeasure. Sa. The king's displeasure! Thou dost then deserve it! ... Traitor, and who art thou? ... It seems to me That I should know thee well. Art thou not one Of that fantastical and haughty flock Of Rama's fanatics? Ahi. I wear the ephod: I, of the Levites chief, to holy Aaron, In that high ministry, to which the Lord Elected him, after a long descent Of other consecrated priests, succeed. Near to the sacred ark in Nob I'm station'd: Th'ark of the covenant in former times Stood in the centre of the camp; but now 'Tis deem'd too much, if e'en clandestinely That camp is enter'd by God's minister: Where Saul is monarch, a strange visitant The priest is held; but he is not so, no, Where Israel fights; if still, as formerly, Through God we triumph. Dost thou not know me? What wonder? Dost thou better know thyself?â Thou hast withdrawn thy footsteps from God's path; And I within the tabernacle dwell, Where dwells the great Jehovah, there, where thou For a long time, oh Saul, hast not been seen. I tell thee, king, I am Ahimelech. Sa. That name proclaims thee, as thou art, a traitor: Now art thou recognized. Before my sight Thou comest opportunely. Now confess, Art thou not he, who to the banish'd David Gav'st an asylum, nourishment, and safety, Deliverance and arms? And say what arms! Goliah's sacred sword, which, dedicate To God, within the tabernacle hung, Whence, with profane hand thou removed'st it, And girded'st it on the perfidious foe Of thy sole lord and king?âThou comest, miscreant, What doubt is there, with treason to the camp? ... Ahi. Assuredly I come there to betray thee; Since on thy arms I come to entreat God For victory, which he to thee denies; Yes, I am he, that, with benignant hand, Assisted David. But who is that David? Of the king's daughter is not he the husband? Not the most valiant 'mid thy men of valour? Not the most graceful, most humane, most just, Of Israel's sons? Say, is he not in war Thy shield, and thy defender? And in peace, Is he not in thy palace, with his songs, The master of thy heart? The love of maidens, The people's joy, the terror of our foes? Such, such was he that I presumed to rescue. And thou thyself, didst thou not erewhile chuse him For the first honours? Not select his arm To guide thy battles? To bring back once more The shout of victory to the camp? To chase That terror of defeat, which in thy heart Thy God hath placed? If thou condemnest me, Thou, at the same time, dost condemn thyself. Sa. Whence, whence in you springs pity? whence in you Inveterate priests, revengeful, thirsty ever For human blood? To Samuel did it seem A crime unpardonable that I slew not Th'Amalekitish king, with arms in hand, Taken in flight; a mighty king, a warrior, Of ardent generous temper, and profuse Of his own life-blood in his people's service. Unhappy king! dragg'd in my presence, he Came manacled; yet he preserved, though vanquish'd, A noble pride, as far from insolence, As from all abjectness. Of courage guilty To cruel Samuel he appear'd: three times In his defenceless bosom did he plunge, With sacerdotal hand, the reeking sword. These are your triumphs, these, vile fanatics. But he who dares to lift his haughty brow Against his lawful monarch, he, in you, Finds an asylum, a support, a shield, All other objects occupy your hearts More than the altar. Who are, who are ye? A selfish, cruel, and malignant tribe, Who yourselves shelter'd, at our dangers laugh, And kirtled in effeminate robes, presume To govern us who sweat in cumbrous mail: Us, who, 'mid blood-shed, apprehension, death, Lead, for our wives, our children, and yourselves, Lives of perpetuated wretchedness. Cowards, less dignified than prating gossips, Would you with lithe wands, and fantastic hymns, O'er us, and o'er our weapons, arbitrate. Ahi. And thou, who art thou? of the earth a king: But in God's sight who reigns?âExamine, Saul, Thyself; thou only art crown'd nothingness.â I, by myself am nothing; but I am A thunderbolt, a whirlwind, and a tempest, If God descends in me; that mighty God Who fashion'd thee; who scarcely bends his eye On thee, and where is Saul?âIt ill fits thee To plead the cause of Agag; foolishly Dost thou pursue him in forbidden paths. For a perverse king, save the hostile sword, Is there a punishment? And does a sword Smite unpermitted by Almighty God? God writes his vengeances in adamant; Nor to Philistia's, less than Israel's sons, Does he commit them.âTremble, Saul: I see Already in a sable cloud on high, Death's dreadful angel poised on fiery wings. Already with one hand hath he unsheathed The pitiless, retributory sword; And with the other, from thy guilty head He plucks thy hoary tresses: tremble, Saul.â There is who doth impel thee to destruction: 'Tis he; this Abner, instrument of Satan; He, who hath poison'd with suspicions vile Thy aged heart; he who hath dwindled thee From a crown'd warrior to a less than child. Thou, thou infatuate man, dost now remove The only true and steadfast prop of thee And of thy house. Where is the house of Saul? On quicksands it is built; it shakes already; It falls; it moulders into dust; 'tis gone.â Sa. Prescient of my calamities art thou, And not so of thy own. Hast thou not seen, Ere to the camp thou camest, that death here Awaited thee? this I predict; and soon Shall Abner's hand this prophecy fulfil.â My faithful Abner go, and change at once All the arrangements of the impious David; For every one of them conceals a plot. To-morrow fight we with the rising sun, The beauteous day-star, of my hardihood Shall be the witness. I am now aware, That from malignity the thought arose In David's breast, to chuse the afternoon For the attack, as most indicative Of my declining arm: but we shall see.â I feel my martial spirits braced afresh By thy rebukes; to-morrow I am leader: The entire day will be inadequate To the great slaughter which I shall inflict. Abner, now quickly from my presence drag This miscreant, and dispatch him. Jon. I beseech thee, Father, reflect a little ... Sa. Hold thy peace.â He shall be slain; and his unworthy blood Shall fall on the Philistines. Ab. Death is his Already ... Sa. But to satisfy my vengeance He only is too little. Let Nob feel That vengeance also; let it smite, consume, Servants, and cattle, mothers, houses, babes, And to the desolating winds disperse All the flagitious race. Thy priests may now Exclaim with truth, âThere is a Saul!ââMy hand, So oft by you provoked to homicide, Never smote you: from hence, and hence alone You scorn that hand. Ahi. No king can hinder me From dying like a just man; whence my death Will be as welcome as it is illustrious. Yours, for a long time, by Almighty God Hath been irrevocably seal'd. By swords, Yet not in battle, not by hostile swords, Abner and thou shall both be vilely slain. Let me go hence.âI have at last address'd God's final sentence to a reprobate, And he is deaf: my mission is accomplish'd: I have lived faithful, faithful shall I die. Sa. Quick let him hence be dragg'd to punishment; To agonizing and protracted death. SCENE THE FIFTH. Saul, Jonathan. Jon. Ill-advised king, what art thou doing? pause ... Sa. Must I once more command thee to be silent?â Art thou a warrior? thou a son of mine? Art thou a champion of the Israelites? Go, go; return to Nob; and there fill thou His empty seat: worthy art thou alone To live in indolence with drowsy priests, Not 'mid the tumults of grim-visaged war, Not 'mid the lofty cares of royalty ... Jon. I also at thy side in combat fierce Have overcome, in multitudes, thy foes. But this, which now thou dost presume to shed, Is sacerdotal, not Philistine blood. Alone thou standest in a fight so impious ... Sa. I am alone sufficient for the contest, Whate'er that contest be. Do thou to-morrow Join the encounter with reluctant steps: I only shall be Saul. What then avail David or Jonathan? Saul is the leader. Jon. Beside thee shall I fight. Ah! may I fall Lifeless before thine eyes, rather than see That which awaits thy reprobated blood! Sa. And what awaits it? death? death in the field? This is a monarch's death. SCENE THE SIXTH. Michal, Saul, Jonathan. Sa. Thou, without David? ... Mi. I cannot find him ... Sa. I will find him. Mi. He Perhaps is far distant; he avoids thy anger ... Sa. Though he had wings my anger should o'ertake him. Woe, if in battle he presents himself: Woe, if to-morrow, when my foes are conquer'd, Thou bring'st him not to me! Mi. Oh Heaven! Jon. Ah father ... Sa. I have no children.âQuickly, Jonathan, Resume thy place among the troops. And thou, Seek and find David. Mi. Ah! ... with thee ... Sa. In vain. Jon. Father, shall I fight far from thee? Sa. From me Be all of you afar. Ye, all of you, Vie with each other in betraying me. Go, I command it: quickly fly from hence. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Saul. Sa. I to myself am left.âMyself alone, (Unhappy king!) myself alone I dread not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. David, Michal. Mi. Come forth, my consort; come: the night already Is far advanced ... Listen, what mingled sounds Issue from yonder camp? The fierce encounter To-morrow's dawn will witness.âRound the tent Where sleeps my father every sound is hush'd. Behold; the heavens themselves assist thy flight: The moon is setting, and a black cloud veils Her latest rays. Let us depart: no one Watches our footsteps now, let us depart: We may descend the mountain by this slope, And God, where'er we go, will be our guide. Da. Oh spouse, the better portion of myself, While Israel is preparing for attack, Can it be true that I prepare for flight? And what is death that I should thus avoid it? I will remain: let Saul, if he will, slay me; So that I first in numbers slay the foe. Mi. Ah! thou know'st not: already hath the rage Of Saul in blood his lifted arm embrued. Ahimelech, discover'd here, hath fallen The victim of his violence already. Da. What do I hear? Hath he his unsheathed sword Turn'd on defenceless priests? Ill-fated Saul! ... Mi. Thou must hear more. The monarch gave himself Cruel command to Abner, that, if thou In battle should'st be seen, our champions should Against thee turn their arms. Da. And Jonathan, My friend, bears this? Mi. Oh Heaven! what can he do? He too endured his father's rage; and ran Distractedly 'mid combatants to die. Now, thou seest clearly, thou canst not stay here: Thou art forced to yield; to fly from hence; and wait, Or that my father change, or that he bend Beneath the weight of years ... Ah, cruel father! Thou thyself, thou forcest thy wretched daughter To wish the fatal day ... But yet, oh no, Thy death I do not wish for: live in peace; Live if thou canst; 'twill be enough for me T'enjoy for ever my loved consort's presence ... Ah, come then; let us go ... Da. How much I grieve To leave the fight! I hear an unknown voice Cry in my heart, âFor Israel and his king âThe terrible day is come.â ... Could I! ... But no: The innocent blood of sacred ministers Was here pour'd out: the camp is now impure, Contaminate is the soil; the face of God Is hence averted: David now no more Can combat here. It is my duty, then, To yield awhile to thy anxiety, And provident love.âBut thou too yield to mine. Ah! suffer me alone ... Mi. Shall I leave thee? Behold, I clasp thee by thy garment's hem; No, never more I part from thee ... Da. Ah, hear me! Ill could thy tardy steps keep pace with mine: Paths, rough with briars and stones, I shall be force To tread with indefatigable feet If I would seek, complying with thy wish, A place of refuge. How can thy soft limbs Bear up against the unaccustom'd torment? And shall I in the wilderness alone Ever abandon thee? Thou seest clearly; Quickly, by thy means, I should be discover'd Quickly would both of us be reconducted To the fear'd vengeance of the king ... Oh Heaven! The mere thought makes me shudder ... Further grant, That we ensured our flight, can I take thee From thy sick-sorrowing father? He is placed Far from the dainty shelter of his palace, Amid the hardships of a camp: his pangs, His irritable age, some solace need. Ah! wipe the tear-drops from his furrow'd cheeks, His melancholy sooth, his fury lull. Thou only pleasest him; thou waitest on him; And thou alone preservest him alive. He wishes me destroy'd; but I wish him Rescued from danger, happy, and triumphant ... To-day I tremble for him.âEre thou wert A wife thou wert a daughter: nor canst thou, Without delinquency, too much indulge Thy love for me.âProvided I escape, What further canst thou wish for me at present? Do not withdraw thyself, I pray thee, do not From thy already too, too wretched father. As soon as I have found a place of refuge, I'll cause the tidings to be sent to thee. We shall, I hope, be reunited soon. Think what it costs me to abandon thee ... But yet! ... ah how? ... Mi. And must I once more lose thee? Once more permit thee to return alone To former sufferings, to a wandering life, To perils, and to solitary caves? .. Ah, if I only always were with thee! .. I might, perchance, alleviate thy ills By sharing them. Da. I do beseech thee, Michal, By our affection; and, if there be need, I also do command thee; inasmuch As one that loves, as I do, may command, Do not now follow me: thou canst not do it Without ensuring my effectual ruin.â But if God will my safety, I ought not To tarry longer here: the time advances: Some spy from his pavilion might detect us, And cruelly divulge our purposes. I know each bosky covert of this hill, And feel most certain that I can elude All human vigilance.âGive, give me now The last embrace. May God be thy support! And do thou never, never quit thy father, Till Heaven once more unite thee to thy consort ... Mi. The last embrace? ... And shall I then survive it? ... I feel, I feel my trembling heart-strings burst ... Da. And I? ... But I beseech thee check thy tears.â Now imp my feet with wings, Almighty God. SCENE THE SECOND. Michal. Mi. ... He flies! ... Oh heavens ... I will pursue him ... Ah! With what invisible fetters am I bound? ... I cannot follow him.âHe flies from me! ... Scarce can I stand ... much less o'ertake his steps ... Once more then have I lost him! ... Who can tell When I shall see him? And art thou a wife, Thou wretched lady? ... Were thine nuptial rites? ... No, no; no more beside my cruel father Will I remain. I follow thee, oh spouse ... Yet if I follow him I cause his death?â Can I, to feign accordance with his steps, Dissemble my slow pace? ... But from yon camp What murmur do I hear, like din of arms? ... I hear it plainly ... and it waxes louder: And with the trumpet's dissonance is mix'd: The tramp of horses also ... What is this? Th'attack before the rising of the sun? Saul gave no hint of this. Who knows? ... Perchance My brothers ... Jonathan ... alas ... in danger! ... But tears and howlings and deep groans I hear From the pavilion of my father rise? Unhappy father! ... I will run to meet him ... But ... he himself approaches; how forlorn! ... How desolate! ... How little like himself! ... SCENE THE THIRD. Saul, Michal. Sa. Incensed, tremendous shade, ah quit my sight! ... Leave me, oh leave me! ... At thy feet I kneel! ... Where do I fly? ... Where can I hide myself? ... Oh fierce, vindictive spectre be appeased ... But to my supplications art thou deaf, And dost thou spurn me? ... Burst asunder, earth, Swallow me up alive ... Ah! that at least The fierce and threatening looks of that dire shade May not quite pierce me through ... Mi. From whom fliest thou? No one pursues thee. Dost thou not see me? Father, dost thou not know me? Sa. Oh most high, Most holy priest, wilt thou that here I pause? Oh Samuel, thou my real father once, Dost thou command it? Prostrate, see, I fall At thy supreme command. Thou, with thy hand, Placed'st the royal crown upon this head; Thou didst adorn it; strip it, strip it now Of all its honours; tread them under foot.â But oh ... the flaming sword of God's revenge Which glares eternally before my eyes ... Thou, who canst do it, snatch it not from me, Oh no, but from my children. Of my crime, My children they are innocent ... Mi. Oh state Of agony unparallel'd!âThy sight Bodies forth things that are not: father, turn Thyself to me ... Sa. Oh joy! ... Is peace inscribed Upon thy face? Severe old man, hast thou In part my prayers accepted? From thy feet I will not rise, till thou hast first deliver'd My unoffending children from thy vengeance.â What voice exclaim'd, âAnd David was thy son; âAnd thou pursued'st him, yes ... e'en to death.â Of what dost thou accuse me? ... Pause, oh pause ... David, where is he? ... Find him: let him come; And let him slay me at his will and reign ... Provided only that he spare my children, Be the throne his ... But art thou pitiless? ... Thine eyes are orbs of blood; thy hand is fire, And fire thy sword; thy ample nostrils breathe Sulphureous flames, that glare and dart at me ... They've caught me now: they burn my heart to dust: Where shall I fly? ... or whither find deliverance? Mi. Cannot my hands restrain thee, nor my voice Convince thee of the truth? Hear me: thou art ... Sa. But no; on this side a prodigious stream Of blood restrains my steps ... Atrocious sight! On both its shores in mountains are up-piled Great heaps of recent corpses: all is death On this side: thitherward I then will fly ... But what do I behold? Who then are ye?â âWe are the children of Ahimelech. âI am Ahimelech. Die, monarch, die.ââ What cry is that? I recognize him well: With recent blood he reeks; let him drink mine. And who is this that drags me from behind? Thou, Samuel, thou?âWhat did he say? That soon We all should be with him? I only, I Shall be with thee; but spare my children ... spare.â Where am I? ... In an instant from my sight Have all the spectres vanish'd. Where am I? What have I said? What am I doing? Who Art thou? What dissonance is this I hear? It seems to me most like the din of battle: But the day dawns not yet: ah yes, it is War's horrid uproar. Quickly, quickly bring My shield, my spear, my helmet: now with speed The weapons, the king's weapons. I will die, But in the camp. Mi. Father, what art thou doing? Be tranquil ... to thy daughter ... Sa. I will have My arms; what daughter? Now thou dost obey me. My helm, my spear, my shield: these are my children. Mi. I will not leave thee, no ... Sa. The trumpets sound Louder and louder. Thither let me go: For me my sword alone will be sufficient.â Thou, quit my side, depart; obey me: there The death which I am now pursuing dwells. SCENE THE FOURTH. Saul, Michal, Abner, with a few fugitive Soldiers. Ab. Oh wretched king! ... Now whither dost thou fly? This is a dreadful night. Sa. But whence this battle? Ab. The foe assail'd us unawares: we are Wholly discomfited ... Sa. Discomfited? And liv'st thou, traitor? Ab. I? I live to save thee. Now, now perchance thy foes rush hitherward: We are compell'd to shun the first attack: Meanwhile the day will dawn. Thee will I lead, With a few followers, to yon upland copses ... Sa. Shall I then live, while all my people fall? Ab. Ah come! ... advance ... the tumult waxes louder. Sa. My children ... Jonathan ... do they too fly? Do they abandon me? Ab. Oh Heaven! ... Thy children ... No, no; they fled not ... Ill-starr'd progeny! ... Sa. I understand thee: they are all destroy'd ... Mi. Alas! ... My brothers? ... Ab. Thou no more hast sons. Sa. What now remains for me? ... Thou, thou alone, But not for me, remainest.âIn my heart Have I been long time finally resolved: And now the hour is come.âAbner, the last Is this of my commands. My daughter now Guide to some place of safety. Mi. Father, no; Around thee will I twine myself: the foe Will never aim a sword against a female. Sa. Oh daughter! ... say no more: compel me not To weep. A conquer'd king should never weep. Save her, oh Abner; go: but if she fall Within the enemy's power, say not, oh no, That she's the child of Saul, rather assure them That she is David's wife; they will respect her. Go; fly ... Ab. She shall, I swear to thee, be safe, If I can aught avail; but thou meantime ... Mi. Oh! ... father ... I will not, I cannot leave thee ... Sa. I will it; and I yet am king. But see, The armed bands approach: Abner, fly hence; Drag her by force with thee if it be needful. Mi. Oh father! ... and for ever? ... SCENE THE FIFTH. Saul. Sa. Oh my children! ... I was a father.âSee thyself alone, Oh king; of thy so many friends and servants Not one remains.âInexorable God, Is thy retributory wrath appeased? But thou remain'st to me, oh sword: now come My faithful servant in extremity.â Hark, hark! the howlings of the insolent victors; The lightening of their burning torches glares Before my eyes already; and I see Their swords by thousands ... âImpious Philistine, Thou shalt find me, but like a king, here ... dead. As he falls transfixed on his own sword, the victorious Philistines come up to him in a crowd with blazing torches and bloody swords. While these rush with loud cries towards Saul, the curtain falls.</field>
