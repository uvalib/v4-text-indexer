      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. This day let me engage you: for this day Good things I bring you here upon the stage. Indeed, in my opinion, 'tis most equitable, To good men to bring good, to bad men evil. That all may have their due; the bad, things bad; The good, things good.âBad men are what they are, Because they hate the goodâThe good, because They hate the evil, must themselves be good. And therefore you are good; since you have always Hated the bad; and by your laws and legions Have driven them hence successfully like Romansâ Now, as good men, bestow your best attention On these our good comedians, who to-day, With the like justice bring good things to you. Ears, eyes, imaginations, understandings, Amply shall here be feasted, amply fill'd. But with an empty stomach, or dry mouth, Whoe'er shall have come hither, all the time Shall be kept broad awake, though not with laughing. To those who have din'd, we shall give laugh enoughâ Those who have not, will still be out of humour, And still find faults.âYou then, who now are hungry, If you have sense, give place, and get you goneâ You with full bellies, stay; sit down, and give AttentionâI shall not discover to you The plot, nor yet the name of this our comedy, That will be fully done by Pseudolusâ In this I'm quite convinc'd I've said enough, Cast off your cares; this day's a day of leisure; Where wit and joking, laughter, wine and jollity, Are proper: where the graces, and decorum Are mix'd with chearfulness, and true delight. Who seeks aught else; I think he seeks for evil. 'Tis the best way for such a man to stretch His loins, rise up and so walk offâFor Plautus Is bringing a long Play upon the stage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter CALIDORUS with a letter in his hand, and PSEUDOLUS. PSEUDOLUS. If from your silence, Sir, I could but learn With what sad cares you pine thus wretchedly, Gladly I'd save the troubling of two persons, Myself in asking, you in answering. But as I cannot learn that way, I'm forc'd To ask you, and pray answer me this question. What is the cause, that now for many days You're so dispirited; and in your hands Still hold a letter, which you wet with tears: To none imparting the sad secret?âNow Speak out; that I may know't as well as you. Cal. Ah! Pseudolus! I am a wretched wretch! Pseu. Forbid it, Jupiter! Cal. This case of mine Lies not before his court. 'Tis from the sentence Of Venus that I suffer, not from Jupiter's. Pseu. May I not know it, Sir? You us'd e'er now To make me chief of all your confidants. Cal. So would I nowâ Pseu. Then tell me what's the matter, I shall find means; if not, I shall contribute My aid, or give good counsel that may serve you. Cal. Then take this letter, [gives a letter.] and there learn what cares Make me thus wretched, and thus pineâ Pseu. I'll do Just as you'd have meâBut what's this, I pray? [looking on the letter. Cal. Why, what's the matter? Pseu. Sir, in my opinion The letters fain would propagate their species, They climb so on the back of one another. Cal. For your own sport you play the fool with me. Pseu. 'Troth, I believe, unless a Sybil reads them, None else can tell the meaning of the scrawl. Cal. Why such sweet letters treat with ridicule, Wrote on so sweet a table, with a hand As sweet? Pseu. What, in the name of wonder, then, Have hens got hands?âFor nothing but a hen Could scratch these charactersâ Cal. Impertinent! Or read the letter, or return itâ Pseu. Nay, I'll read it throughâBut give me your attention. Cal. I cannotâ My attention's not at home. Pseu. Then call it inâ Cal. No, I'll in silence wait. 'Tis in that letter; call it home from thence; There my attention's lodg'd, not in my breast. Pseu. Methinks I see your mistress, Calidorus! Cal. See her!âO, where? Pseu. Why in this letter here. Stretch'd at full length she lies upon the paper. Cal. May all the gods and goddesses!â Pseu. Preserve me! Cal. Not long since, was I like a plant that springs In solstice seasonâSudden I sprang up, As suddenly decay'dâ Pseu. Be silent, Sir, 'Till I have read itâ Cal. Why then don't you read it? Pseu. [reading.] âPhÅnicium to her lover Calidorus, âBy means of wax, wood, and expressive letters, âSends healthâFrom you she begs health to herself; âBegs it with weeping eyes, with trembling hand; âWith thoughts distracted, and heart full of fearsââ Cal. Undone!âFor no where find I, Pseudolus, That health to send herâ Pseu. What health?â Cal. Health in money. Pseu. Would you, for health which she sends you on paper, Return the compliment to her in money?â Consider what you doâ Cal. Do but read on; And from the letter, I'll engage you'll find What pressing need I have to raise some money. Pseu. [reading.] âThe pandar, you must know, my dear, has sold me âTo a Macedonian captain now abroad, âFor twenty minÃ¦âFifteen he paid down âE'er his departureâFive remain still due. âFor these, the captain left behind a token, âHis image ta'en in wax from a seal-ring; âSo that whoever brings the like impression, âThe pandar is to send me off with him; âAnd the next feast of Bacchus is the day âAppointed.â Cal. That's to-morrowâNear at hand Thus is my ruin, if you cannot find Means to prevent itâ Pseu. Let me read to the end. Cal. I'd have youâFor the while you read, with her I seem conversingâPray read onâYou give me In this the sweet and bitter mix'd together. Pseu. [reading.] âNow all our loves, and lover's ways familiar, âOur jokes, and play, sweet converse and sweet kisses, âOur equal close embracings, wanton woundings âWith tender lips, provoking, gentle pressures âOf rising breasts; these pleasures are all vanishing, âFrom you as well as me; and separation, âDistance, a desart of all bliss is coming, âUnless from this sad fate you can preserve me, âOr think that I alone can make you happy. âThus have I taken care, that you should know âAll that I know myself: and shall experience âNow from the event; what real love you bear me, âOr what make meer pretences to!âFarewell!â Cal. 'Tis a sad writingâ Pseu. Sadly writ, indeed! Cal. Why dost not weep?â Pseu. My eyes are pumice stones, I cannot make them shed a single tear. Cal. Why so? Pseu. I'm of a dry-eyed generation. Cal. And will you then adventure nought to aid me? Pseu. What can I do for you? Cal. Ah me! [sighing. Pseu. Ah me! I can supply you with ah me's! enough: Nor need you e'er be sparing of the use of them. Cal. Unhappy me! I ne'er shall find, my Pseudolus, The means of borrowing money any where. Pseu. Ah me! Cal. I've not a single piece at home. Pseu. Ah me! Cal. The fellow bears her off to-morrow. Pseu. Ah me! Cal. Is this the way then you assist me? Pseu. I give you what I haveâI've of this coin At home, a fund that's inexhaustible. Cal. Nay, then 'tis over with meâCan't you lend One drachma but?âYou shall be paid to-morrow. Pseu. Scarcely I think, if I should pawn myself for it. What could a drachma do? Cal. 'Twould buy a rope. Pseu. For what? Cal. To hang myselfâFor I'm determin'd E'er dark to take a leap into the dark. Pseu. Then who shall pay my drachma, if I lend it? And would you wilfully go hang yourself, To cheat me, should I lend it, of my drachma? Cal. Should she become another's, and I lose her, I could on no account survive the loss. Pseu. Why do you weep, you cuckow?âYou shall live. Cal. Have I not cause? when I have neither money, Nor hope to raise a single piece. Pseu. I find then By the tenor of this letter, that unless You could weep silver drachma's in her lap, All you can do to endear you by your tears, Would be but sending water in a sieve. But I'm your friend, fear not, I'll not desert you. I've hopes by hook or crook, this very day To get you a supply of money somewhere. And yet I can't tell howâ'Tis all to comeâ But that it will be so, I make no doubt, The dancing of my eyelids tell me soâ Cal. O that your words may be made good by deeds! Pseu. You know if once I set my wheels a going, What stir and bustle I am us'd to raise. Cal. My every hope is center'd now in you. Pseu. Will you be satisfied, if I this day, Make the girl yours, or get the twenty minÃ¦? Cal. Well satisfied, if so it comes about. Pseu. The twenty minÃ¦, then demand of me. That you may know, I'll make good all I say, Demand them nowâI long to engage for them. Cal. Will you this day then get me twenty minÃ¦? Pseu. I willâSo be no farther troublesome. And that you may not say I did not promise, I tell you this beforehand, if I fail, I'll touch your father for the money. Cal. Now may the gods preserve you for my service! Nay, if you can, for aught my duty hinders, E'en touch my mother tooâ Pseu. For that be easy, And sleep on either eyeâ Cal. On either eye! Or either ear, do you mean? Pseu. The latter is Too trite a sayingâNow that none may say That they were not forewarn'd, I here proclaim To all both young and old, that here are present, To all my friends, and those to whom I'm known, That they this day take more especial care How they give credit to me. Cal. Hist! Be silent! Pseu. Why, what's the matter now? Cal. The pandar's door! I hear it creak.â Pseu. I would it were his legs. Cal. 'Tis the old rogue himself is coming forth. [they stand apart. SCENE II. Enter BALLIO, the procurer, and several slaves. Bal. Come out, bestir, ye lazy, dear-bought scrubs, Who ne'er once think of doing what is right. Of whom, unless after this manner treated, [beating them. No good is to be got.âI ne'er saw men Such asses, so unfeeling are their sides, Beat them, you hurt yourselfâSuch dispositions Have these same whipping-stocks, they'll counsel thus Each other: Whensoe'er occasion serves, Take, pilfer, pocket, seize upon, drink, gormandize, Then run awayâThis is their tradeâ You may as well leave wolves among your sheep, As these to guard your houseâTo look, upon them, You'd think them something; they have no bad aspect; But when you come to action, they deceive you. Hear nowâUnless you will attend this charge; Shake sleep from off your eyes, and from your breast Drive laziness, I'll have your sides well scourg'd With thongs, till they've as many colours on them As carpets of Campania: and till No Alexandrian tapestry, wrought with figures Of beasts, like them, be equally variegated. Before I told you, gave you yesterday Your several tasksâBut you're such heedless animals, And so perverse, you force me thus with stripes To make you do your duties, as you're order'd, Such are your stubborn dispositions. Get then the better of this scourge and me. Look at themâThey're intent on other matters. Attend to this, and mind now what I say; Turn your ears to me, do, you race of rascals, Born for the scourgeâYou'll find this thong of mine As tough as any of your backs, I warrant you. [strikes one of them. How now?âDo you feel it?âThis the slave deserves Who holds his master's orders in contempt. Stand all of you before me, and attend To what I sayâYou that have got a pitcher, Bring water, and go fill that kettle there DirectlyâYou with the ax there, I assign The task to cleave that woodâ Slave. But, Sir, the ax Has lost its edgeâ Bal. Well, be it soâI think The stripes you've had have taken off your edgeâ Yet notwithstanding you shall all be usefulâ You, see and clean the house: you have your business. Go, get you inâ[Exit 1 slave.] You lay the couches smooth. You, clean the plate, and place it all in order. Be sure, when from the Forum I return, That I find all things ready: that I find them, Brush'd, scour'd, smooth'd, each thing clean, and as it should be. It is my birth-day: and 'tis fit you all Should celebrate itâLet the gammon, neck, The loin, the paps, be soak'd a while in water. D'ye mind me?âI shall make an entertainment For men of rank, that they may look upon me As of a man of propertyâGo in then, Get all in readiness; that when the cook Comes to me, there be no delayâ[Exeunt slaves.] I'll strait To market, and bespeak there all the fish. Go you before, boyâI must take great care That no one cuts my purseâYet stayâI had Almost forgot, I'd something more to say At homeâAttend to me, ye women slaves. I've some commands for youâYou then, who spend Your time with men of figure, in the indulgence Of neatness, dainties and of delicacy; You misses of distinction; I shall know By trial made this day, which of you minds Her person, which her appetite, and which Thinks on her business, which on nought but sleeping. Which of you I shall think of setting free, And which of parting with by sale to others. See that you bring home presents in abundance From your gallants this day.âFor, mark, Unless I raise of you a whole year's provision, To-morrow I shall let you out for hire. You know it is my birth-dayâWhere are now Your men who love you as they do their eyes? Who call you life, dear, darling, sweeting, honey? Here make them come in crowds before my doors With presentsâWhy procure I for your use Money, and cloaths, and allâWhile I at home, Get nothing but vexation for my pains. Jades, ever moistening your clay with wine; While I'm without a dropâI find 'tis best To call you o'er by name; lest some of you Should say they were not told their businessâList! List all thenâFirst Hedylium with youâ Your dealings are among the corn-factorsâ Who all heap up mountains of wheat at home. Be it your care, they bring sufficient hither, To serve me and my family a year: And that I may abound so much in corn, The city may henceforward change my name, And call the pandar Ballio, royal Jason. Cal. [apart.] Do you hear the rogue? What pompous words he utters? Pseu. In troth he does, and mischievous ones too. But let's be silent, and attend to him. Bal. You too, who have your friends among the butchers, Those apes of us procurers, men who get, Like us, their money by their perjuries, You, Ãschrodora, hear meâIf to-day You fill not my three larders full of meat, I'll tye you up to-morrow to the larder, As heretofore the sons of Jove serv'd DircÃ¨, And tyed her to a bull, as says the storyâ Your bull shall be that larderâ Pseu. [apart.] I'm on fire To hear the fellow's talkâIs't not a shame The Athenian youth should suffer such a man. Where are they, say, where skulk the youth who at Maturity, have dealings with this pandar? Why not agree, why not combine together To rid the city of this pestilence. But I'm a fool, and ignorant of the matter. Dare they deal so with those, to whom their lust Makes them submissive; and prevents their acting Against the rogues, as otherwise they would? Cal. Psha! Peace! Pseu. Why so? Cal. It is not quite so civil To me, to spend your breath on such a rascal. Pseu. Sir, I am dumbâ Cal. 'Tis better so you were, Than keep thus prating of it. Bal. Xystilis, Do you attend to meâYour lovers deal In oyl, and have large quantities at home. If you procure me not some skins of oyl; I'll put you in an empty skin to-morrow, And hang you up in't 'gainst the porticoâ That skin shall be your bedâA bed, I warrant, Of little sleep, but languishment enough. You mark the tendency of what I sayâ You viper, you who have so many friends, Laden with oyl, are any of the heads Of these your fellow-slaves, say, are they better Anointed for't? Or shall I have my hash The better oyl'd for itâBut well I know You are too fond of wine to value oyl. Assure yourself however, I'll pay off All your old scores, you jade, if you this day Perform not what I here enjoin youâNow, For you, PhÅnicium, now I speak to you, The minion of the great, you who are always So ready to pay down the money for Your liberty, yet never keep your word: Unless good store come from your friends to-day, To-morrow sees your hide under the pent-house, Dyed with PhÅnician colour, my PhÅnicium. [Exeunt slaves. SCENE III. CALLIDORUS and PSEUDOLUS come forward. Cal. Hear you not what he says, my Pseudolus? Pseu. I hear it, Sir, and take good notice of it. Cal. What present would you have me send to him, To hinder him from making my own mistress Stand here for hire? Pseu. Take you no care about it; But smooth your mindâI'll take sufficient care Both for myself and youâ'Tis now long time That he and I have equally well wish'd Each otherâAn old grudge subsists between us. I'll send him something upon this his birth-day, Some heavy mischiefâ Cal. But be speedy with Whate'er is to be doneâ Pseu. Mind something else, Can't you? Cal. Butâ Pseu. Hush! Cal. I'm on the rackâ Pseu. Take courage. Cal. I can'tâ Pseu. Endeavourâ Cal. How can I controul My passion? Pseu. By attending more to what Regards your interest, than in your distress, What suits your inclinationâ Cal. Trifling all! There's no delight in love unmix'd with folly. Pseu. Do you persist? Cal. Let me alone, my Pseudolus, And let me be undoneâ Pseu. I may depart then? [going. Cal. Stay, stayâI'll be as you would have me be. Pseu. Now you talk sensiblyâ Bal. Time wears. I loiter. Go you before, boyâ[going. Cal. Hola! thereâHe's goneâ But call him backâ Pseu. And why in such a hurryâ Gentlyâ[to Callidorus, who is pressing him.] Cal. Before he's goneâ Bal. What hindrance now? Do you saunter now?â[to the Boy. Pseu. You, born to-day! you, born to-day! 'Tis you I call; you born to-day, look on usâ Whatever business you're about, we stay you. StopâThere are those who fain would speak with you. Bal. What is the matter? Who is't stops me thus, When I have business? Cal. One who has been your friend. Bal. Your has been friend is deadâThe man that is, He is your living friendâ Pseu. You are too saucy. Bal. You, too impertinentâ Cal. Lay hold on him: O'ertake himâ Bal. On boyâ Pseu. This way let us meet him. Bal. Confound thee, whosoe'er thou art! Pseu. And thee!â Bal. And both of you, say I!âTurn this way, boyâ Pseu. Must I not speak to you? Bal. When I please, you may. Pseu. Suppose 'tis for your interest? Bal. You may. Have I your leave to live, or have I not? Pseu. Psha! stopâ Bal. Nay, let me goâ Cal. But, Ballio, hearâ Bal. I'm deaf; you talk but nonsenseâ Cal. When I had To give, I gaveâ Bal. What's given I ask not forâ Cal. And when I have it, I will give again. Bal. When that's the case, why take away your mistress. Cal. Alas! How ill my money's been bestow'd, How ill my presents! Bal. Now your money's gone, You give me wordsâFool that you are, your cause Is tried alreadyâ Pseu. Ay, but know at least, Who 'tis that speaks to you.â Bal. Full well I know Who once he wasâWho he is now, is best Known to himself.âOn, boyâ Pseu. What! not one look, When 'tis your interestâ Bal. At that price, I will. For were I to high Jove to sacrifice; The entrails in my hand, ready to lay Upon the altar, shew one glimpse of interest, With joy I'd quit the unfinish'd ceremony. Pseu. This fellow's not to be attack'd with piety, As others areâAs to the gods, whom all Ought highly to revere, he values not A rushâ Bal. I'll speak to himâGood day to you! Of all Athenian slaves, the very vilest. [to Pseu. Pseu. The gods and goddesses protect you, Ballio! It is his wish and mineâOr, if unworthy, May they ne'er be propitious, nor protect you! Bal. How fare you, Callidorus? Pseu. Why, he fares As well as love and poverty will let him. Bal. If pity would maintain my family, I'd pity himâ Pseu. We know you well enough, No need proclaim yourselfâBut know you, Ballio, What we would with you? Bal. I can guessâNo goodâ Pseu. Attend to this, and what we call'd you back for. Bal. Well, I attendâBut be as brief as may be, For I am busyâ Pseu. My young master here, Is quite asham'd he has not perform'd his promise: And paid you at the time he had appointed, The twenty minÃ¦ also for his mistress. Bal. What we're asham'd of, with more ease we bear Than what we're vex'd at.âThe young man's asham'd He has not paid the moneyâAnd I'm vex'd I've not receiv'd itâ Pseu. He'll procure and pay it: Wait a few days.âHe only fears you'll sell her, Upon this disappointment. Bal. Had he chose it, He might have paid it to me long agoâ Cal. What if I had it not?â Bal. Why, was you not In love?âYou should have gone and borrow'd itâ Have given interest for it to a bankerâ Or robb'd your father of itâ Pseu. Shameless rascal! What! robb'd his father?âThere's not any fear You'll put him in an honest way of doing it. Bal. That is not pandar likeâ Cal. Is't like I should Steal from my father: from a man so cautious. And if I could, duty forbids the crime. Bal. I hear youâTake your duty to your arms This night, instead of your PhÅnicium. But since your duty's to your love prefer'd, Is every man your father?âCan't you borrow Of some one elseâ Cal. The term is obsolete. Bal. They who insist upon their own, yet pay not The money that they owe, and leave the table, When they have had sufficient, then men learn Caution from others never to lend money. Cal. Most wretched am I! I shall ne'er procure Some money: I'm as much undone by love, As want of cashâ Bal. Why then, buy oyl on trust, And sell for ready moneyâBy this means, You easily will raise two hundred minÃ¦. Cal. The quina-vicinarian law there ruins meâ All fear to trust meâ Bal. That same law binds me. I am afraid to trustâ Pseu. Afraid to trust?â Repent you then the profit you've made of him? Bal. He's no true lover, who desists from givingâ Give to the lastâAnd when he has nothing left, Then let him cease to loveâ Cal. No spark of pity! Bal. You're empty handedâSpeeches make no chink. I wish you, Sir, however, health and lifeâ Pseu. What! is he dead then? Bal. In some sort he isâ He's with these speeches really dead to me. When his procurer's pleas'd, a lover lives. Be your complaint to me, a monied one. For this same want of cash, which you lament So deeply, tell your story to your step-mother. Pseu. Say, was you ever married to his father? Bal. From such a thing as that, defend me, gods! Pseu. I prithee, Ballio, do what we request, And, if you will not trust him, on my faith, Both sea and land I'll ransack, but I'll pay The money in three daysâ Bal. Trust you!â Pseu. Why not? Bal. Because I look upon the trusting you Like tying up a dog with chitterlings, That's like to run awayâ Cal. And do you thus Requite the favours I have done to you? Bal. What would you with me now? Cal. Only to wait Six days before you sell the girl, and be The death of him who loves herâ Bal. Courage then, Even six months I'll wait. Cal. Well said, a clever fellow! Bal. Shall I then make you, happy as you are, Still happier? Cal. How is that? Bal. Because I've now Got no PhÅnicium to sell to you. Cal. Not have her? Bal. Not I, truly. Cal. Hither Pseudolus, The victims bring, the offerings and the priests, That I may sacrifice to this high Jove, A greater Jove to me, than Jove himself. Bal. I want no victims, give me but the entrails. Cal. Why this delay?âHasten and bring the lambsâ Hear you not Jove here?â Pseu. I'll be here this instant. I will but run without the Metian gateâ Cal. Why thither? Pseu. But to bring two executioners With carts; fit priests for himâWith them, two flocks Of elm twigsâto appease this Jove of oursâ I'll to gibbet send this pandaring Jupiter. Bal. 'Tis not for your advantage, I should die. Pseu. Your reason? Bal. ThisâIf I were dead, you'd find No greater rogue in Athens than yourself. Pseu. Nor is't for your advantage I should die. Bal. Your reasonâ Pseu. ThisâIf I were dead, you'd find No greater rogue in Athens than yourselfâ Cal. But tell me, Ballio, in good earnest tell me, Have you not my PhÅnicium now to sell? Bal. By Pollux' temple! noâI have her notâ I sold her some time sinceâ Cal. And how? Bal. Why stripp'd Of all appertinencesâbut her purtenance. Cal. What! sold my love! Bal. And well: for twenty minÃ¦. Cal. For twenty minÃ¦? Bal. If you like it better, For four times fiveâTo a Macedonian captain; And have fifteen in handâ Cal. What do I hear of you? Bal. Hear!âThat your love is turn'd to ready money. Cal. How durst you?â Cal. 'Twas my pleasureâshe was mine. Cal. Ho! Pseudolus! go bring a swordâ Pseu. For what! Cal. To kill that rascal first, and then myself. Pseu. Rather yourselfâAs for that rascal there, Famine will be his executioner. Cal. Most perjur'd villain, that the earth e'er swallow'd, Did you not swear you'd sell her but to me? Bal. I own itâ Cal. Ay, and on your conscience too. Bal. Ay, on my conscience. Cal. You are perjur'd then, You villainâ Bal. I have got the money tho', And wicked I, may broach it at my pleasureâ While you, a good and pious son, have nothing. Cal. Assist me, Pseudolus, on either side, To load this rascal here with maledictions. Pseu. With all my heartâNor would I to the PrÃ¦tor More swiftly run, was he to make me free. Cal. Load him with curses in abundance then. Pseu. I'll publish him to all the worldâThou lack-shame! Bal. Most true. Pseu. Thou rascal!â Bal. True. Pseu. Thou whipping-post! Bal. Why not? Cal. Thou robber of the dead! Bal. For certain. Cal. Jail-bird! Bal. Well doneâ Cal. Faithless! Bal. O, that's my trade. Pseu. Parricide! Bal. Onâ Pseu. Robber of holy places! Bal. I own itâ Cal. Perjur'd! Bal. An old story that. Cal. A law-breaker! Bal. A strong oneâ Pseu. Pest of youth! Bal. O, much soâ Cal. Thief! Bal. Ay, wonderful, indeed! Pseu. Thou vagabond! Bal. PshÃ ! PshÃ ! Cal. Thou common cheat! Bal. Most plainly soâ Pseu. Deceitful!â Cal. Filthy bawdâ Pseu. Scum of the earth! Bal. Fine singers, both of you! Cal. You beat your father and your motherâ Bal. Nay, Kill'd them too, rather than give them foodâ Is that a crime? Pseu. No more: for all we say Is just like pouring water in a sieve. Our labour's all in vain. Bal. Have you ought else To charge me with? Cal. Are you asham'd of nothing? Bal. To have found a lover empty as a nut-shell. But tho' you have bestow'd hard names upon me; Curses in plenty too; unless the captain Bring the five minÃ¦ which he owes to me, (This is the very day he was to pay it) If he comes not, I think I'll do my dutyâ Cal. And what is that? Bal. Why, if you bring the money, I'll break my faith with himâThis is my dutyâ So, if 'tis worth my while, we'll have more talkâ But without money, 'tis in vain to prate Of pityâThis I am determin'dâSo You may consult what 'tis you have to doâ Cal. What, are you going? Bal. I am full of business. Pseu. E'er long you will be more soâHe's my man: [Exit Ballio. And now, if gods and men do not desert me, I'll bone him, in like manner as a cook Will bone a lampreyâBut now, Calidorus, I'd have you mind meâ Cal. What are your commands? Pseu. I'd raise a battery 'gainst this town, to take it This day: and for that purpose, I must have Some artful, knowing, clever, cunning fellow, One who'd dispatch the business, and ne'er think Of sleeping o'er itâ Cal. Tell me your design. Pseu. You'll know in timeâI love not repetitions Of the same things.âThat way are stories made Too long. Cal. Your plea's indeed most right and just. Pseu. Make hast; and quickly hither bring the man. For out of many men, we find but few, Who are staunch friendsâ Cal. 'Tis what I know full well. Pseu. Hast then, and make your choice; and out of many, Pick one that shall be so. Cal. He shall be here This instantâ Pseu. HenceâYou lose your time in talk. [Exit Calidorus. SCENE IV. PSEUDOLUS alone. Pseu. Since he is gone, here, Pseudolus, thou stand'st AloneâWhat's now to do, now that thou's been So liberal to thy old master's son In promises?âWhere are they?âThou hast not A single drop of any certain project; Much more, thou art not sure of any money. And what to do I know not: how begin To weave this web; nor, when begun, to end it. But as a poet sits him down to write, And seeks that which is no where, and yet finds it, Making the probable from fiction spring, So, I will be that poetâTwenty minÃ¦ Which now are not, I'll findâA long time since I promis'd my young master to procure them. I then had thoughts of throwing out my hook To catch the old oneâBut I know not how, He smelt a ratâBut hush! I must be silent: I see my master Simo walking there With Callipho his neighbourâI'll 'ere night Dig twenty minÃ¦ out of this old sepulchre, And give them to his sonâHere I'll retire, And try to pick up what they're talking ofâ [stands apart. SCENE V. Enter SIMO and CALLIPHO. Call. If a Dictator now were to be chosen Out of the spendthrifts and gallants of Athens, None of them would bid fairer than my son. 'Tis the town-talk, in ev'ry body's mouth, He had set his mistress freeâAnd for that purpose He is hunting after money.âThis I hear From othersâAnd indeed, for some time past, I have thought on it, and suspected it myself. Pseu. [apart.] So then, the affair's cut shortâThis business Won't be done hereâThe way I find's block'd up Where I propos'd to go a foraging For moneyâYes, he smoak'd meâOn that coast No pilfer for maraudersâ Call. Your reporters, And listners after faults, by my good will, Should both be hang'd; the former by the tongue, The latter by the earsâWhat you have heard Of your son's love, and chousing you of money, May be a pack of liesâBut were they true, As the world goes, what has he done surprising? 'Tis nothing new, that a young man should love, And make his mistress free. Pseu. [apart.] Well said, old boy! Sim. Tho' old the custom, I'd not have him follow it. Call. What you'd not have, it is in vain to say. I warrant, you ne'er did so in your youth: That father must be good indeed, who'd wish His son to be still better than himself. The pranks you've play'd, distributed about, Would serve the townâAnd is it then a wonder Your son should then thus imitate his fatherâ Pseu. [apart.] O Jove! How few men are there thus commode! Ay, ay! This is indeed to be a father. Sim. Who is't that speaks here!â'Tis my servant Pseudolus. This rascal's the corrupter of my son, His chief, his leader to the school of lust. I'd put him to the torture. Call. Folly that, To be so quick in anger!âSure 'tis better To address your son with calmness; and enquire Whether these things you hear abroad are true. O, a good temper's half in half in evils. Sim. I'll do as you would have me. Pseu. [apart.] Pseudolus, They're making up to theeâNow for a speech Against the old man comesâI first must greet, As it is right, my master, wish him happiness. And, if I've any left, I'll give't my neighbours. Simo. [to Pseu.] Good day to youâWhat are you upon? Pseu. My legs: Just as you seeâ Sim. Observe his posture, Callipho. As if he were a person of condition. Call. I see he stands upright with good assurance. Pseu. So should a servant who is innocent, Stand up with confidenceâAnd chiefly so Before his masterâ Call. Pseudolus, we want Strictly to question you about some matters We've seen and heard as through a cloud, imperfectlyâ Sim. He has such command of words, you'd think 'tis Socrates, Not Pseudolus, that holds you in discourse. Pseu. 'Tis soâYou long have held me in contempt I know; and little confidence have had in me. You'd make me out a villain; but shall find I shall appear to you an honest man. Sim. See that there be free entrance, Pseudolus, In at your ears; so that my words may pass Whither I'd have themâ Pseu. Come then, speak your mind; Say what you will, yet am I angry with you. Sim. You who're a slave, angry with me your master? Pseu. Do you think that strange? Sim. I do, by Hercules! Think strange, that I must guard against that anger Which you avowâYou mean to make me suffer A different kind of sufferings from those You've us'd to bear from meâ Call. Whate'er you think, He's right, in my opinion, to be angry, For that you question his integrityâ Sim. Well, let him be as angry as he will, I'll be upon my guard, he shall not hurt meâ But tell me, what do you say?âWhat's this affair On which I question you?â Pseu. If you would know What's in my power to tell you, why then ask me, Depending on an answer as authentick As from the Delphick oracle?â Sim. Then mind me, And take good heed you keep your promiseâWell, What say you?âKnow you that my son's in love, And with a musick-girl?â Pseu. [aside.] I must deny itâ Sim. Whom he would fain make free?â Pseu. This and that too, I do denyâ Sim. And that by fraud and cunning, You're now contriving to get out of me Some twenty minÃ¦â Pseu. I, Sir! out of you! Sim. Ay, out of me: which you may give my son To free his mistressâ Pseu. This too, Sir, and that I do confessâ Call. Come, come, he owns the factâ Sim. Have I not said as much to you but now? Call. I recollectâ Sim. Why, when you knew all this, Was it conceal'd?âWhy was I kept i'th'dark? Pseu. I'll tell youâ'Twas because I did not care To be the author of so bad a custom, As for a servant to accuse his master, And to his masterâ Sim. Would you not advise To have this fellow drag'd by neck and heels Strait to the work-house? Call. Has he done amiss? Sim. Amiss?âYes much amissâ Pseu. Desist, I beg youâ[to Call. I understand my own affairsâThe fault Is mineâAttend then, and I'll tell you why I kept the secret of your son's amour. I knew that if I had inform'd you of it, I had been sent that instant to the work-house. Sim. And knew you not the work-house was your doom, If you did not discover it? Pseu. Why yes. Sim. Then why not tell it me?â Pseu. Because this was A present evil; t'other, farther off: This is the spot, and that a little distant. Sim. And what's now to be done?âYou cannot trick Me of the money who have smoak'd your plot. And I'll take care to make the affair so publick, No one shall trust you for the smallest sum. Pseu. I shall apply to none, while you're alive. You will yourself lay down the money, Sirâ Of you I'll have it. Sim. Have of me the money? Pseu. Undoubtedlyâ Sim. Yes, you shall have an eye Out of this head, if e'er I give it you. Pseu. You'll give it tho'âI tell you this, that you May be upon your guard nowâ Sim. This I know For certain, that if you get ought from me, It will be great and wonderful, indeedâ Pseu. I'll do itâ Sim. If you don'tâ Pseu. Why then, the scourge. And now, what if I do?â Sim. Jove be my witness! You shall live ever free from punishment. Pseu. See you remember.â Sim. Shall I not take heed, When I'm forewarn'd?â Pseu. Take heed, I say, take heed. Still I forewarn youâWith those very hands You will pay me the moneyâ Call. By Pollux' temple! A clever fellow if he keeps his word!â Pseu. Make me your slave for ever if I don't. Sim. Kindly said that, when you are mine already! Pseu. Shall I then tell you both more wonders still? Call. Those I'd fain hearâI list with pleasure to you. Sim. Come on, I list with pleasure to you too. Pseu. Yet e'er I fight this fight, I'll fight another, Which shall be still more famous and more memorable. Sim. What fight?â Pseu. A victory o'er this pandar hereâ By fraud and artful tricks, this musick-girl Your son so loves, I'll cheat this fellow of. Sim. Say you?â Pseu. This evening bring them both to bear. Sim. Then do but as you say, and king Agathocles In valorous deeds is but a fool to you. But, should you fail, can you shew any cause I should not strait confine you to the work-house? Pseu. Not only for a day, but, troth, for ever. But tell me, if I should effect my purpose, With good will, will you then advance the money, To pay to the procurer out of hand? Call. He asks but rightâSay, Yes, I'll give it himâ Sim. But know you, Sir, what's come into my mind. Suppose they lay their heads together, Callipho, And in compact, by some invented trick, They should contrive to chouse me of my money. Pseu. 'Twere impudence beyond compare, for me To attempt so foul a deedâAnd, if in compact, Any contrivance, Simo, we have form'd, Or ever join'd in this affair together; Write on my back with elm-twigs for your styles, As thick as you would letters in a book. Sim. Proclaim the games as soon as e'er you please. Pseu. I beg you, Callipho, give me this day, And don't engage yourself in other business. Call. I had determin'd yesterday, to go This day into the country. Pseu. Change your scheme. Call. On this occasion then, I'll stay, that's certain, I have a mind to see these games of yours. And if I see my friend refuse his promise, Rather than so, I will pay down the moneyâ Sim. I shall not change my purpose. Pseu. If you do, Both ears shall hear of it, by Pollux' temple! Come on, remove you in doors for a while, And leave me room in turn to play my tricks in. Sim. Then be it soâYou e'en shall have your way. Pseu. But I must have you keep at homeâ Sim. This too I'll do to humour youâ Call. Well, I must hence To th'ForumâI'll be back again immediatelyâ Sim. Make hast then, and returnâ [Exeunt Call. and Simo severally. Pseu. [to the spectators.] I much suspect That you suspect I mean but to amuse you, With all my feats, while this my play is acting; And never do what I have said I would. I shall not change my purposeâ'Tis full sure It will be so; but by what means I know notâ Only, that so it will beâWho appears First on the scene, in some new character, Should shew some new inventionâIf he cannot, Let him resign his place to one who can. Permit me therefore to withdraw a while, To bring my tricks togetherâIn the mean time, Our player on the flute shall entertain you. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter PSEUDOLUS. O Jupiter! whate'er I undertake, How pretty, and how prosperous is the event! Whatever project in my mind is form'd, I neither doubt of the event, nor fear it. 'Tis folly with a timorous heart, to attempt A great exploit.âFor all affairs turn out According as we manage them, and raise them Into importanceâBy premeditation So well am I provided with my forces, My double, triple tricks and perfidies, That wheresoe'er I meet the foe, relying On my own wicked industry and wit, Deceitful, I may confidently say, My perfidies will give an easy conquest, And furnish me with plunder cheaply purchas'd. First you shall see how cleverly I'll batter This Ballio, this our common enemy. This town will I besiege with such success, This day it shall surrender.âHither, ay, Hither I'll march my legions.âIf I sack it, I soon shall make all easy to my friends. This done, to the old town I'll march my army; There load myself and my allies with plunder; Then put my enemies to fear and flight; And make them know I'm somebody.âA man So born should such exploits perform, as may Make him illustrious to posterity. Who have we here? What unknown fellow's this That meets my eyes? I'd fain know what he means; [seeing Harpax at a distance. And with a swordâI'll lye in ambush for him.â [retires apart. SCENE II. Enter HARPAX, foot-boy to the Captain. Har. This is the place, and this the very spot My master pointed out to me, if rightly My eyes the measure take of the directions, Which thus my master gave meâFrom the gate The seventh house; that house the captain told me, Where the procurer liv'd; to whom he bad me Carry this money, and this ring.âI wish Some one for certain would inform me where This Ballio livesâ Pseu. [aside.] 'St! 'St!âThis is my man. If gods and men do not at once desert me, Here is new matter, that requires new counsel. I at first sight, find I must change my measures, And alter my first batteryâA smart onset I'll make upon this soldier-like appearance, This captain's messengerâ Har. I'll beat the door, And call out some one hither from the house. Pseu. Whoe'er you are, I soon shall stop your knocking, I, patron and defender of these doors. Har. Are you then Ballio? Pseu. No: I'm Under-Ballio.â Har. How's that? Pseu. Why, yeoman of the larder, butler, And caterer. Har. O ho! that's to say, his porter. Pseu. Nay, I'm above his porter. Har. Then what are you? Are you a slave, or freeman? Pseu. I'm as yet A slave. Har. So it should seem; nor by your looks E'er likely to be otherwise. Pseu. When you Abuse another, do you ne'er look back Upon yourself? Har. A sly chap! [aside. Pseu. As the gods Shall love and favour me, this man's my anvil: And many a project shall I forge on him. [aside. Har. What is it he keeps muttering to himself? Pseu. What is't you say, young man? Har. What is't I say? Pseu. Com'st thou or no, from the Macedonian captain A messenger, who bought a girl of us? Who fifteen minÃ¦ to my master paid, And owes five more?â Har. I doâBut how i'th'world Do you know me? where seen, or spoke to me? For I have never been before at Athens; Nor, till this day have e'er set eyes on you. Pseu. I thought you seem'd from thence; because your master Appointed, when he went away, this day For payment of the money; and ne'er sent it. Har. Here 'tis. Pseu. And have you brought it? Har. Ay, myself. Pseu. Why then not give it me? Har. Give it to you? Pseu. By Hercules! to me, I'm Ballio's steward, Look after his accounts; receive, lay out, And pay his money where 'tis due. Har. By Hercules! If you was treasurer to Jove supreme, I would not trust you with a doit. Pseu. How stout Soe'er you are, the money will be paid. Har. No, I shall rather keep it closer. Pseu. Fie! Are you the first man that has found the way To call in question my fidelity; As if I was not often trusted with Six hundred times as much! Har. Others may trust you; But by my troth, not I. Pseu. Why, that's as if You said I should defraud youâ Har. You say thatâ 'Tis but as if I only should suspect it. But what's your name? Pseu. [aside.] This pandar has a slave Call'd SyrusâI will say that I am heâ My name is Syrus. [to him.] Har. Syrus? Pseu. That's my name. Har. We wast the time.âIf Ballio is at home, Why, call him forth, that I may do my message, Whatever your name may be. Pseu. Where he within, I'd call himâBut if you will give it me, The business shall be better done, than if You gave it him. Har. But you're to know, my master Sent me to pay this money, not to lose it. You're in a fever now, because you can't Lay your claws on it. I'll not trust a doit, To any one, except to Ballio's self. Pseu. But he is busy now: he has a cause Before the judge. Har. Success attend him in it! And when I judge that he's at home, I'll come AgainâHere take this letter; give it him: For there's the token between both our masters About the girl. Pseu. I know full well, my master Order'd the girl shou'd be deliver'd him, Who with the money shou'd produce his figure Cut on a ring; and left its fellow here. Har. You know the whole affair. Pseu. Ay, what should hinder? Har. Then, give this ring to himâ Pseu. Depend upon it. And now what is your name?â Har. Harpax. Pseu. How! Harpax! I like you not, friend Harpax! and, by Hercules! You shall not come within these doors, for fear You verify your name; call'd rightly Harpax. Har. I us'd to carry captives off alive From battle; thence I had the name of Harpax. Pseu. Rather, by Pollux! from your carrying off From houses, pots and kettles. Har. 'Tis not so. I scorn your words. But, Syrus, do you know What I'd beg of you? Pseu. Yes, if you would tell me. Har. I go to step aside into a tavern, The third without the gate; 'tis kept by Chrysis, A tun-bellied, lame, heavy croneâ Pseu. What then? Har. That you, as soon as e'er your master comes, May send for me from thenceâ Pseu. Ay, if you chuse itâ Har. For as I am fatigu'd with my long journey, I want refreshmentâ Pseu. Sensible enough! I like your schemeâBut when I send for you, Be sure you're in the wayâ Har. O, after dinner My business always is, to take a napâ Pseu. That I supposeâ Har. Have you ought else with me? Pseu. Only that you will go and take your napâ Har. I'm goneâ Pseu. But hark you, Harpax!âTake good care That you have clothes enough to cover you; A sweat will do you good. [Exit Harpax. SCENE III. PSEUDOLUS alone. Pseu. Immortal gods! This fellow by his coming has preserv'd me: And by his journey, when I'd lost my way, Has put me right again. E'en Opportunity Herself could ne'er have come more opportunely, Than he, that opportunely brought this letter. My horn of plenty this, in which, whate'er I wish'd is all contain'd. Here are my wiles, Here all my stratagems, here all my tricks; My money's here; here my young master's mistress. Now shall I boast, from what a fertile fund Of thoughts in my own breast I did delineate Exactly in what manner I should act, So as to steal the girl from the procurer. All things beforehand plann'd and decorated, In order just as I myself would have them. And all my schemes are form'd with certaintyâ But this affair in truth will thus succeed Meerly by fortuneâFor the goddess Fortune Frustrates the counsels of a hundred wise heads. And 'tis but truthâThe man who knows to use His fortune, he surpasses all: by all Is therefore call'd a man of understanding. Whoe'er we find successful in his counsels, We call a prudent manâThe unsuccessful We hold a foolâFools as we are, we know not How greatly we're mistaken, when so ardently We pray the gods to grant us what we wish: As if 'twere possible for us to know, What will turn out to our advantageâThus We lose a certainty, and grasp a shadowâ What follows, but i'th'midst of pains and labour, Death creeps upon us in the interim.â But I philosophize, and prate too longâ Immortal gods! my late invented lye Was worth its weight in gold, when I pretended That I belong'd to the procurer here. Now with this letter, I'll deceive three persons; My master, the procurer, and the bearer. I now shall be upon a par with themâ Another thing too which I wish'd, has happen'd. See, Callidorus comes! A stranger with him! [stands apart. SCENE IV. Enter CALIDORUS and CHARINUS, in discourse. Cal. I've told you all my pleasures, all my pains; My love, my trouble and my needs you're now Inform'd of. Cha. All of them I bear in mind. Tell me but this, what 'tis you'd have me do? Cal. All those, and other things besides I mention'd, That you might fully understand the affair About the tokenâ Cha. I tell you, I know allâ Let me but know, what you would have me do. Cal. Well, you must know then, Pseudolus thus order'd; That I should bring him one who wish'd me well And zealous in my causeâ Cha. You well observe Your orders: for a friend and a well-wisher, You're bringingâBut that Pseudolus to me's A strangerâ Cal. Quite a man as one could wish. He's my inventor: and has promis'd me He'll bring to pass all for me which I've told you. Pseu. Now in a lofty strain will I address him. Cal. Whose voice is that I hear there? Pseu. [advancing.] Io! Io! Io! thrice sovereign lord!â'Tis you I want, Who're sovereign over Pseudolusâ'Tis you I'm looking for, to give you three times joy, A triple joy, three joys three ways obtain'd, By three tricks, three times earn'd, over three parties, Thro' wickedness, craft, fallacy triumphant, Seal'd in this little scroll, to you I've brought them. Cal. This is the manâ Cha. The rascal's in heroicks! Cal. Advance thy steps and join himâ Pseu. Give thy hand Freely to him who has sav'd theeâ Cal. Tell me, Pseudolus, What god shall I salute thee as?âAs hope, Or as salvation? Pseu. Both, bothârather bothâ Cal. Well then, as both I do salute theeâ What's done? Pseu. What fear you? Cal. I have brought the person. Pseu. What, brought him, say you? Cal. I would say, conductedâ Pseu. Who is it? Cal. Why, Charinus. Pseu. O, well done! There's a good omen in the name. Cha. Whate'er Is necessary to be done, command me. Pseu. My thanksâGood day, CharinusâBut I would not, You think us troublesome. Cha. You troublesome! That word to me is all that's troublesome. Pseu. Then say no moreâ Cal. What have you in your hand? Pseu. I've intercepted but e'en now this letter: With it, this tokenâ Cha. Token?âSay what token? Pseu. Why, that the captain sent here by his servant, With it five minÃ¦âHe was to carry off Your mistressâBut I eas'd him of itâ Cal. How? Pseu. For these spectators is the play perform'd; And if they know it who were present at it, I'll tell it you another time. Cal. But what's The present business? Pseu. To embrace your mistress, And to embrace her free. Cal. Shall I? Pseu. Ay, youâ Cal. Myself! Pseu. Yourself, I sayâsure as I live, So you procure me speedily a manâ Cal. What sort of man? Pseu. One cunning, arch and crafty; One, who when he's possess'd of the beginning Of an affair, knows by his ingenuity What part he has to act. He must be one Besides, who has little visited these quartersâ Cha. Um! Does it matter ought if he's a slave? Pseu. 'Twere better so than free. Cha. I think, I can Fit you with one, cunning and arch enough, One from Charysto, just come from his father. He has not yet been out of doors, arriv'd But yesterday at Athens. Pseu. That's all right. But 'twill besides be requisite to borrow Five minÃ¦, which I will repay this day. His father owes me one. Cha. I'll lend them you. Look out no farther. Pseu. You're the man I wantedâ But I shall want a soldier's coat, a sword, And hat. Cha. With them I will equip you too. Pseu. Immortal gods! I'll now no longer call you Charinus, but Abundance. But this slave, That's from Charysto come, what! is he arch? Cha. E'en from his cradle. Pseu. Then 'tis fit he should Have a long coat with sleevesâBut has he in him Any thing sharp?â Cha. Ay, marry! very sharp. Pseu. But can he on occasion, draw out sweets From the same cask; from his own breast I mean?â Has he of that? Cha. And make you that a question? He has nectar, sweet wine, wine enrich'd with herbs, Mead, sweets of all sortsâNay, he once intended To set up in his breast a shop to sell them. Pseu. O brave! O rare! Charinus the facetious! At my own game you beat meâBut what name Am I to call this slave by? Cha. Simia. Pseu. Does he know how to extricate himself When hamper'd? Cha. Not a whirlwind is so speedy. Pseu. Subtle? Cha. In great rogueries, very frequently. Pseu. When caught in the manner, how behaves he then? Cha. O, like an eel, he slips away from you. Pseu. And is he knowing? Cha. Yes, as any register. Pseu. By your account, he is the man we want. Cha. To tell you moreâLet him but fix his eyes Upon you, he will tell you what you'd have with him. But what is't you're about? Pseu. I'll tell you then. As soon as ever I've equipp'd my man, I'd have him personate the captain's slaveâ To the procurer let him bear this token; With it five minÃ¦; and bring off the girl. Thus ends the whole of this my comedy. But I'll instruct him how to act in all. Cal. What do we wait for now? Pseu. Go, bring the man Accoutred quite compleat, to Ãschinus The banker'sâBut make hast Cha. We shall be there Before youâ Pseu. Get you gone then speedily. [Exeunt Cal. and Cha. Whate'er before was doubtful or uncertain, Now clears, and I can see the light before me. My legions, every one beneath his standard, I will draw out, according as I please, And with auspicious omen. Oh! I feel That I shall crush my foes. Now to the Forum, To load this Simia with my weighty precepts, That nothing fail of all he has to do; But the whole trick be carried handsomely. The pandar's fort shall now be ta'en by storm. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter BOY. Whene'er the gods decree a boy should be A slave to a procurer, and especially If he be basely treated too, it must Be own'd, they heap misfortune and distress, Great as I feel this present at my heart, So wretched, so deplorable my servitude. By miseries small and great of every kind I am hemm'd in; nor can I find a friend Who'll love me well enough to find the means To keep me clean, or treat me with good cheer. This is the birth-day of the pandar here, And every mother's son from high to low Who sends him not a present on this day, He swears with threats, shall pay for it to-morrow. Troth, in my case, I know not what to do. Nor can I do like others who are able. Unless I send some present here to-day, I'm beaten like a fuller's cloth to-morrow. Alas! even now how much am I an infant In this affair? And how much, wretched I Still dread this manâIf any make a present That feels more heavy in the hand than mine, However hard and grudgingly they pay for it, I seem, as 'twere, to grind my teeth with fear. But I must keep my tongue within my teeth, For here my master comesâWith him a cook. SCENE II. Enter BALLIO the procurer, and Cook. Bal. The cook-market is foolishly so call'd, The thief-market's a better name by half. For were I on my oath, I could not find A greater rascal than this cook I bring. A prating, bragging, silly worthless fellow. Nay, on this very account it is, that Orcus Would not admit him into his dominions, That he might still remain on earth a cook, On purpose to dress suppers for the dead: For only he can dress them to their likingâ Cook. If as you think you speak, why did you hire me? Bal. Out of necessity; there was no other. But if you are the cook you fain would pass for, Say, why was you left sitting in the market? Cook. I'll tell youâ'Tis man's avarice alone Makes me the cook you say I am; and not My want of geniusâ Bal. Ha! how prove you that? Cook. I'll tell youâWhen a person comes to market To hire a cookâhe don't enquire for one Who is the best, and must be paid most wages. They always hire the cheapest and the worst: Hence have I sat all day in the market-place. Those rascals follow any for a drachmaâ I never let myself for less than gold. I make not out like other cooks my supper, Who in their dishes, serve up season'd meadows, As if their guests would go to grass like oxen. Those herbs they season; but with other herbs, Fennel and garlick, coriander; orach, Sorrel, blite, beet and cabbageâand then temper it With a full pound of lazerwortâWith these They bray the roguish mustard, such as makes The grinder's eyes before they've done, drop tears. E'en let such fellows cater for themselves! They serve their sauces with no proper seasoning, But with vile herbs, that eat the bowels up. Hence 'tis that men live here so short a life, Stuffing their guts with herbs, as formidable To hear, as eatâSuch as the beasts won't touch, They eat themselvesâ Bal. And what do you? Are yours Such heavenly sauces, as prolong men's lives, That you're so sharp on others? Cook. You may say so, And boldly too; for with my cookery, A man may live two hundred years at least. For when I have into my saucepan put My cicilendrum or my sipolindrum, My mace, or my sancaptis, strait the saucepan Heats of itself. For king Neptune's herds this sauce; For those of earth, I serve my cicimandrum, My happalopsides, or cataractria. Bal. May Jupiter and all the gods confound you, With all your sauces, and your lies together! Cook. Let me go on. Bal. Go on then, and be hang'dâ Cook. Soon as my saucepans all begin to boil, I strait uncover them; when the fragrant odour Mounts down unto the skies, and Jupiter Sups on it every nightâ Bal. How? mounts down? Cook. A slip that of the tongue. Bal. How's that? Cook. I would Have said, mounts up. Bal. But when you dress no victuals, On what does Jupiter sup then? Cook. O, then, He goes to bed without his supper. Bal. Rascal! Go and be hang'd! Is it for this I give you A piece a day? Cook. I'm an expensive cook I own: but for the wages I receive, You find my business doneâ Bal. Yes, that of stealingâ Cook. Expect you e'er to find a cook that has not The talons of an eagle or a kite? Bal. Expect you to be hired for a cook, And not to have your nails par'd close, before You set about your work?âYou, boy of mine, [to the boy. See you put every thing out of the way. Your eye have upon his; and as he looks, Look you; and when he goes, go you along. If he lift up a hand, why, lift up yours: If he but take his own, why, let him take it; If ought of ours, hold fast on t'other sideâ Moves he? do you moveâStands he still, stand you. Stoops he? stoop you. Besides this pupil here, I shall have private spies. Cook. Oh! never fear. Bal. Must I not fear, that bring you with me home? Cook. The soup that I shall make for you to-day, Shall make you young and lively as old Pelias Just issuing from Medea's kettle; for As she, by compositions and enchantments, Made an old man come out a young one, I Will do the same by you. Bal. O, ho! You are turn'd Enchanter too? Cook. By Pollux' temple! no: I'm rather man's preserver. Bal. Stay, and tell me What shall I give to teach me one receipt? Cook. What's that? Bal. Why, a receipt to hinder you From pilfering. Cook. If you confide in me, Two drachma's; if you doubt, not e'en a mina. But say, the supper you're to give to-night, Is it to friends or enemies? Bal. To friends, You may be sure. Cook. I would you'd giv'n your supper To enemies and not to friends: for I Shall such a relish give to this day's feast, 'Twill make them eat their fingers. Bal. Then, by Hercules! Before you give it to my guests, I beg you Tast it yourself, and give it to your gentry, That you may first gnaw your own thievish fingers. Cook. Perhaps you don't believe a word I say. Bal. Come, ben't impertinent. You prate too much. I like it notâThere is my house, go in, And get the supper ready in all hast. Cook. You and your guests get to your couches quick, The supper's spoil'd already. Bal. See that rogue, That scullion's under-lick-dish to his master: I know not, troth! which to look after first, Such thieves are in my house. A rogue there is Here at next door. My neighbour at the Forum, Father of Calidorus, here was warning me, To have an eye on Pseudolus his servant, For that he's been upon the hunt, if possible, How he this day may cheat me of this girl; And that to him he had engag'd his word, By stratagem to rob me of PhÅniciumâ Now will I in, and give my people charge That not a soul give credit to this Pseudolus. [Exit. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter PSEUDOLUS, speaking to SIMIA, supposing him behind him. PSEUDOLUS. If the immortal gods meant help to-day, Myself and Calidorus they design'd To be preserv'd, through that procurer's ruin, Then, when they form'd thee, Simia, to assist me With all thy arts of cunning and deceit. Where is he tho'? [looking back.] What?âAm I grown a fool, To talk thus to myselfâSure he has deceiv'd me. Knave as I am, I have not taken care Not to be cheated by another knaveâ If he has given me thus the slip, I'm ruin'd: Nor shall I do the business of the day. But hold, I see the whipping-postâHow stately [Enter SIMIA the Counterfeit, dressed like HARPAX, at a distance.] He stalks!âSoho!âI was just looking for youâ I fear'd, by Hercules! you had slipt away. Sim. And if I had, I'd acted but in character. Pseu. But where have you been loitering? Sim. Where I pleas'd. Pseu. I know that well enough. Sim. Then why do'st ask? Pseu. But to remind you of it. Sim. Teach your grannamâ Pseu. You treat me with contemptâ Sim. Why should I not? I, who am now to pass for a campaigner? Pseu. I'd have our undertaking briskly follow'd. Sim. And do you see me doing of ought else? Pseu. Bestir your stumps then. Sim. Slow and sure's my rule. Pseu. This is the nick of timeâWhile he's asleep I'd have you go to Ballio.â [meaning Harpax. Sim. But, what hast? SoftlyâFear not. Jove send the fellow here, Whoe'er he be, that's coming from the captain! He shall no more the real Harpax be, Than I am.âPluck your courage up; and hear me. I will so scare this military stranger With lies and tricks, he shall deny himself, And own, not he, but I'm the very man. Pseu. Is't possible? Sim. You make me mad to doubt it. Pseu. A noble fellow! Jupiter preserve thee! With all thy lies and stratagems, for me! Sim. Me for myself!âBut does my dress become me? Pseu. It sits quite well. Sim. That's good. Pseu. Now may the gods Grant you your wish; for did they give you all That you deserve,âyou'd come but poorly off: For I ne'er saw a finer rogue and rascal. Sim. To me that compliment? Pseu. I've doneâBut say What present shall I make you, if you manage This business cleverlyâ Sim. Cannot you be quiet? Whoever prompts a man that minds his business, Putting him still in mind, but puts him outâ I comprehend it allâ'Tis laid up here. [pointing to his breast. I've well consider'd every stratagemâ Pseu. He is a worthy fellow! Sim. Noânot he, [pointing to Pseudolus. Nor I. Pseu. Take heed you make no blunder now. Sim. What, will you ne'er have done? Pseu. Now may the gods So love meâ Sim. That they'll never do, you're so Made up of liesâandâ Pseu. As I love thee, Simia, E'en for thy rogueries and praising fear thee. Sim.

Nice eating, wine, perfumes, and 'twixt our cups, Some fine tid-bitsâTo these a girl of wit, Who'll give you kiss on kiss. Sim. That's nice indeed! Pseu. Succeed, and find me better than my word.

A tankard and a cup are all yet stolen. Pseu. Hist! Hark you! now's your time: a fair occasion [aside to Simia. Presents itselfâ Sim. To me it seems so tooâ Pseu. The way he comes, do you step slily into; And I'll here place myself in ambuscade. Sim. I've kept with care the number in my head: Sixth from the gate; this lane, the next I come to My master bad me turn intoâBut then How many houses off, I'm quite uncertain. Bal. [aside.] What fellow's this!âA soldier's cloak upon him! Whence is he?âOr whom seeks he!âBy his face He seems a foreigner; and of mean rank. Sim. But I see there a man will clear my doubts. Bal. To me he makes directlyâWhence i'th'world Can come this fellow?â Sim. Hark you!âYou that stand With your goat's beard there, answer me a questionâ Bal. Don't you first give me civil salutation. Sim. I give no gratis salutations, I.â Bal. By Pollux! just the same you'll have from me. Pseu. This the beginning is of their fair dealing. Sim. In this lane know you any man? I ask theeâ Bal. Why yes; I know myself. Sim. Few men do that, Which you pretend toâFor you'll meet i'th'Forum, Scarcely with one in ten who knows himself. Pseu. Oâsafe's the wordâhe's now philosophizingâ Sim. I'm looking for a fellow here, a sad one, A lawless, impious, perjur'd, wicked rogue. Bal. 'Tis me he's seekingâThese are my additionsâ If he but knows my nameâBut what's he call'd? [to Simia. Sim. Why Ballio, a procurerâ Bal. Do I know him? Myself am he, young man, you're looking for. Sim. What are you Ballio? Bal. Troth the very manâ Sim. How like a housebreaker the fellow's drest? Bal. Were you to see me in the dark, I think You'll scarcely meddle with me. Sim. Well, my master Would that I give you many salutationsâ He bad me give this letter to youâTake itâ Bal. What man is he who bad you? Pseu. Quite undone! He sticks i'th'mire: he does not know the nameâ We're all agroundâ Bal. Who, guess you sent the letter? Sim. Look on the sealâDo you tell me his name; That I may know you are the very Ballioâ Bal. Give me the letterâ Sim. Take itâAnd the seal Examine wellâ Bal. O ho! I know it wellâ 'Tis he himself; PolymachÃ¦roplacides. Sim. Yes, yes: his name's PolymachÃ¦roplacidesâ By this I know the letter's right deliver'd, Since you have told his nameâ Bal. But say, how fares he? Sim. Why, as a stout and gallant soldier shouldâ But hast, I beg you hast and read the letter, There's business in it; to receive the money, And send me out the girl immediatelyâ For I must Sicyon see this day, or else Be hang'd to-morrowâMaster's such a tyrant!

Yes, I see it, And know the figure wellâBut does he never Use any salutation in his letters? Sim. Ballio, that were not soldierlikeâHe sends Health to his friends, but to his foes destruction. But on as you've begun; and mark the letter. Bal. Do but attend then [reading.] âHe who comes to you âIs my page HarpaxââWhat are you that Harpax? [to him. Sim. I amâI'm Harpax selfâ Bal. [reading.] âHe who this letter âBrings you, from him I'd have you take the money. âBy him too would I have you send PhÅnicium. â'Tis worthy to send greetings to the worthy; âWere that the case, I had sent such to you.â Sim. What's to be done now? Bal. Why, give me the money, And take away the girl. Sim. Well, which of us Makes the delay? Bal. Then follow me. Sim. I followâ [Exeunt. SCENE III. PSEUDOLUS comes forward. Pseu. Well! a more cunning rascal, and a craftier, Than this same Simia, never have I seen: I sadly fear the fellow'll play some trick With me, as he has done with Ballio: And in his better fortune butt at me; He is so mischievous on all occasions. And yet I would not think so: for I love him: But after all, I'm in a desperate fright; And for three reasons. First and foremost, least My comrade should desert me, and go over To join the foe. Next, least in the interim My master from the Forum should return, And, with their booty, seize the plunderers. Last, in the midst of all my fears, I fear, That Harpax there, may hither come before This Harpax here, is gone hence with the girl. We're ruin'd!âwhat a while they're coming out: My heart is waiting, ready bag and baggage, In case he comes without the girl forthwith, To pack off into exile from my breastâ Victoria!âOf my guards I've got the betterâ SCENE IV. Enter SIMIA the Counterfeit, with PHÅNICIUM. Sim. Weep not, PhÅnicium! you don't know as yet How stands the affair; but you shall know at supper. I do not bear you to that gag-tooth'd fellow The Macedonian captain, who occasions These tears of yoursâI lead you to the man Whom you most wish to be withâI'll take care You shall e'er long embrace your Calidorusâ Pseu. Why did you stay so long within? my heart Was ready to beat through my breast the while. Sim. A plague upon your questions, you waylay me, When we should gain a march upon the enemy. Pseu. Well, well, for once we'll take a knave's adviceâ Let us be gone strait to our bowl of triumph. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Enter BALLIO the Procurer. Bal. Ha! ha! ha! ha! [laughing.] at length my heart's at ease, Since he is gone, and carried off the girl. Now could I wish that rascal Pseudolus Would come, and try out of this girl to trick me. He has con'd his lesson well, I know for certain. I'd rather be forsworn a thousand times, Than be the laughing-stock of such a rascal, If I now meet with him, by Hercules! I'll laugh him off the stageâBut I believe He must be in the work-house soon: for such Were the conditions of his own proposal. Now do I wish, that I could meet with Simo, That I might make him partner of my joy. SCENE VI. Enter SIMO. Sim. I must go see what business has been done By my Ulysses; whether he has yet Borne off the prize from Ballio's citadel. Bal. O happy man! give me thy happy hand. Sim. The matter? Bal. Nowâ Sim. What now!â Bal. You've nothing left To fearâ Sim. How so?âHas Pseudolus been with you? Bal. Not so.â Sim. Then what good fortune has befaln Bal. Your twenty minÃ¦, Pseudolus to day Promis'd himself from you, are safe and sound. Sim. I would they were, by Hercules! Bal. Of me Demand the twenty minÃ¦, if this day He either gets this girl into his clutches, Or, as he promis'd, gives her to your son. Demand of me the cashâI long to promise. Depend upon it, all your money's safe; And you shall have the girl into the bargain. Sim. I see no danger in the terms you offer.â And you'll engage the twenty minÃ¦?â Bal. Ay. Sim. A special bargain this! But have you met him? Bal. Yes, both of them together. Sim. Well, what says he? What is his talk?âWhat story does he tell you? Bal. Why, mere stage cant. He call'd me names, the actors Give us procurers: every boy can tellâ He said, I was a wicked, perjur'd rascalâ Sim. He told no lyesâ Bal. Nor was I angry with him. What matters it to call a man hard names, Who nor regards it, nor denies their truth? Sim. How is it you have nought to fear from him? I'd fain hear that.â Bal. Because he never will Bear off the girl from me, nor ever can. Don't you remember, some time since I told you, I'd sold her to a Macedonian captain? Sim. Yes, I rememberâ Bal. Well, e'en now, his servant Brought me the money, and the token with it Agreed between us, seal'd up in a letter. Sim. What follow'd?â Bal. Why, as 'twas agreed, the bearer Has not long since borne off with him the girl. Sim. Do you say this with honesty and truth? Bal. Whence should I get those qualities? Sim. Howe'er See that he has not put some trick upon you. Bal. The letter, and the token that's within it, Put it beyond all doubtâAnd, more than that, He has not only ta'en her from the city, But gone away with her to Sicyon. Sim. Well done, by Hercules!â'Tis now high time To send off Pseudolus, to join the colony At th'work-houseâWho's this in a soldier's coat? Bal. I know him notâLet's step aside, and mark Whither he's going, and what he is aboutâ [they go apart. SCENE VII. Enter HARPAX. Har. That slave's a base and wicked fellow, who Pays to his master's orders no regard. And he too, who neglects to do his duty, Unless he's often put in mind of it, Is good for nothing. They, who deem themselves, As soon as master's back is turn'd, at liberty; And give themselves to riot and debauch, Shall never have another name than slave. Nor any spark of genius do they shew, But to maintain them in their wicked sleight. With such I herd not, speak not; nor am I Renown'd among 'em. But, as I am order'd, I deem my master present in his absence; And dread his anger tho' he is not by: That when we meet, I may have nought to fear. 'Tis worth attending to. Syrus, to whom I gave the token, wou'd have let me stay Till this time in my quarters.âAs he bad me, I staid thereâWhen the bawd came home, he said He'd send for me.âBut since he neither came, Nor sent, I'm come here of my own free motion, To see the cause, lest he play tricks with me. I'd best knock at the door, and give a call For some one to come out; for I would fain The pandar should receive of me this money, And send away the girl along with me. Bal. Hark you!â Sim. What would you? Bal. Here I have my manâ Sim. How so? Bal. Because I'll make a prey of him. He wants a wench, and has the money ready. O! how I long to fix my teeth upon him. Sim. What, would you eat him? Bal. Yes, while he is fresh, And warm, and fit to please my appetite. 'Tis your chast gentry keep me poor; your lewd ones I feed on well: my fortune is augmented By dealing with bad menâThe good and true I lose byâAll my profit's from the wicked. Sim. [aside.] Mischievous fellow!âAnd the gods will give Mischief to thee, thou art such a wicked rascal. Har. But I delay to knock here at the door; And know, if Ballio is at home. Bal. [to Simo.] 'Tis thus Venus befriends me, when she hither sends Her sons of dissipation and expence; Who of their youth and money take such care: Eat, drink, wenchâQuite another kind of creatures, Than thou art, Simo: suffering not thyself To indulge, and envying those that do. Har. Hola! Where are you all? Bal. He's making to my house. Har. Where are you all, I say? Bal. Hark you, young man; What want you there? (This fellow'll be rare plunder) [aside. I knew he'd bring good luck! Har. Will no one open? Bal. You, in the cloak, what business have you there? Har. I'm looking for the pandar Ballio's house. Bal. Whoe'er you are, you need not look for it long. Har. Why so? Bal. The man's here, face to face before you. Har. And are you he? Sim. Take care, man, of yourself; [to Har.] And point him outâthis is an old procurerâ Bal. And, this a man of probityâbut oft Your man of probity, when cash runs low, Is set with duns, that make the Forum ring, And to the old procurer he's oblig'd For a supply. Har. What! won't you answer me? Bal. Yes sure. What want you? Har. Take your money, do. Bal. I'd long been ready, wou'd you give it me. Har. Take itâHere are five minÃ¦ ready told; This debt PolymachÃ¦roplacides My master bad me pay youâJust the sum, And that you send PhÅnicium home by me. Bal. Your master! Har. Ay. Bal. The captain! Har. Ay, I tell you. Bal. The Macedonian captain? Har. To be sure. Bal. And so, PolymachÃ¦roplacides Sent you to me? Har. You say the truth. Bal. To give This money to me? Har. Yes, if you're the pandar, And your name Ballio? Bal. Well!âand to bear off The girl? Har. Just so. Bal. PhÅnicium, did he say? Har. You're right. Bal. Well, stay a moment, I'll return Immediatelyâ Har. Don't stay, for I'm in haste. The day's far spent you seeâ Bal. I see it is. I'll only call him, [pointing.] here to be a witness [aside to Simo. What's to be done now, Simo? say, what course Are we to take? I plainly smoke the fellow Who has brought the money. Simo. Well, how so?â Bal. And do you Know nought of this contrivance? Sim. Just as much As does the man i'th'moon! Bal. By Pollux' temple! That Pseudolus of your's, a rogue of rogues! O what a cunning scheme has he contriv'd! The sum the captain ow'd me, he has given Here to this fellow, and instructed him To fetch the girl. Certain, thy Pseudolus Has hither sent this Counterfeit, as from The Macedonian captain. Sim. Ha'st the money? Bal. Do you ask that and see it? Where's your eyes? Sim. Good! but remember, one half of the prey Belongs to me; it is to be divided. Bal. Plague on you! that, you may depend upon. Har. Will you dispatch me? Bal. Presently. What, Simo, Would you advise me in this case to do? Sim. Let's make some sport with this same Counterfeit. Bal. Yes, 'till he's sensible he's made a fool of. Follow me thenâAnd, so you say you are [to Harpax. The captain's slave? Har. Most certainly. Bal. What was The price he gave?â Har. His valour in the fieldâ In my own country, I was general. Bal. What, did your master lay siege to a jail, That he took you? Har. Come, no hard words, friend. You'll have as much from me. Bal. And when do you say Did you set out from Sicyon? Har. Yesterday, At noonâ Bal. He's made good hast, by Hercules! How swift of foot he is: look at his calves, You'll find by them he can bear heavy chainsâ I'll warrant when a boy, he scorn'd a cradle. Har. Go, hang yourself! Bal. That you yourself may do, You will have time enough for it in the day. Har. Come, send the girl out, or restore the money. Bal. Well, stay a little. Har. Wherefore shou'd I stay? Bal. What give you for the hire of that same cloak? Har. What do you mean by that? Bal. And of that sword? Har. These fellows should be dosed with hellebore. Bal. How!â Har. Come, ha' done. Bal. What do you pay the owner For that same hat? Har. What, owner! Do you dream? The things are mine, and bought with my own money. Bal. With your own back, you mean! Har. These dotards here Have bath'd, and want a'nointing and a rubbing, As is the custom. Bal. Prithee tell me, truly, What now does Pseudolus give you for this job? What is your price? Har. What Pseudolus do you mean? Bal. Your tutor, your instructor in your art, How you may rob me of my girl by slights.â Har. What Pseudolus, what slights do you tell me of? I know of no such man. Bal. Will you not pack? Here's nothing to be got by counterfeits. You may go back, and tell your Pseudolus, One Harpax has been here, beforehand with you, And carried off the booty.â Har. Pollux' temple! Why I am Harpaxâ Bal. So you wou'd be thoughtâ But are an arrant counterfeitâNo more. Har. I'm sure, I paid the money to yourself; And some time since, on my arrival, gave The token to your slave, here at the door, A letter seal'd up with my master's seal. Bal. A letter to my slave! To what slave, say. Har. To Syrus. Bal. This rogue has not brass enough. He's but a sorry counterfeit, and shallow. But O rare Pseudolus! By Pollux' temple! How cunningly the rogue had hid his hook. Here was the very sum the captain owed, Ready in hand; and then he had his lesson, To take the girl away.âFor the true Harpax Gave me that letter here, into my hands. Har. My name is Harpax: my condition, slave To the Macedonian captain. I know no trick. I play, nor act the counterfeit in aught; I'm not acquainted with this Pseudolus, Nor know I who he isâ Sim. I'm much mistaken, Procurer, if you've not quite lost your girl. Bal. The more I hear, the more I am afraid so, By Pollux' temple! Sim. Ay, the very name Of that same Syrus made my blood run cold, Who took the tokenâWonderful! 'tis Pseudolus! Hark you, my lad? What kind of man was he You gave the ring to? Har. Why, a red hair'd fellow, Gorbellied, and big headed, with sharp eyes, Thick calves, red face, and his complexion, wainscotâ Swinging large feetâ Sim. Then you have lost the girl! The feet are his;â'tis Pseudolus himself. Bal. 'Tis over with meâand I can't survive it. Har. Ay, but you must tho', 'till you've pay'd the money, My twenty minÃ¦. Sim. Twenty more to me. Bal. And will you take it of me, when you know I spake it but in joke. Sim. Of a known rascal 'Tis right to make one's market any how. Bal. At least, you'll give up Pseudolus. Sim. Give him up? What is his crime? Have I not giv'n you warning, An hundred times, to be upon your guard?â Bal. He has undone me. Sim. And has lay'd a fine On me of twenty pretty minÃ¦. Bal. What Shall I do now? Har. Give me the money but, You may go hang yourself. Bal. The gods confound you! Then to the Forum follow me, that I May there discharge the debtâ [to Harpax. Har. I follow you. Bal. This day I clear with strangers:âFellow-citizens Must tarry till to-morrow. [to Simo.] This same Pseudolus Has from all quarters summon'd all his forces, And sent this fellow to bear off the girl. You, follow me.âYou must not, Sirs, expect, [to the spectators. As matters stand, that I return this way; By alleys blind, I'll in at the back door. Har. Were your legs nimble as your tongue, by this You'd reach'd the Forum. Bal. 'Stead of my birth-day, They've made a dying-day of it to me. [Exit Ballio, Harpax following. SCENE VIII. SIMO alone. Simo. I've touch'd him handsomelyâso has our slave His adversary. And for it, I'm determin'd To lay a trap for Pseudolus, unlike The common end of plays, with whips and scourges: The twenty minÃ¦ shall be my revenge, I promis'd him, in case he did the business. I'll seek him for the purposeâPseudolus Is the most crafty, subtle knave alive; He outdoes Trojan Dolon and Ulysses. I'll go count out the money; and this Pseudolus Shall find I'll have my quirk, as well as he. [Exit. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter PSEUDOLUS, drunk, with a wreath on his head. PSEUDOLUS. How's this? [staggering.] And is it so? Will you stand still My feet, or not?âOr would you I lie here, And some one pick me up?âIf I do fall, By Hercules! the fault is all your own. And will ye on?âAh! I must now sit downâ There is in this same wine a horrid fault; It lays you first by the heelsâA subtle wrestler! Now 'troth I've fairly got my fill, and left them. Delicious feasting!âdelicate fine living!â So rarely in so rare a place receiv'd!â But what need many words?â'Tis this makes men In love with lifeâHere every pleasure, here Each grace [Uh!] Ay, next the life the gods live surely. Here when the lover clasps his mistress' waist, Joins lip to lip, and presses breast to breastâ Where the white hand puts round the luscious cup To [Uh!]âfriendly friendshipâWhere none holds his neighbour In hate or envyâor in senseless prate. Ointments, perfumesâribbons and festal wreathsâ Nor was the rest serv'd niggardlyâSo ask No questions.âThus I, and young master spent This day luxuriously:âmy task all finish'd, Quite to my mind, and all my foes dispers'd. Feasting, carousing, wenching have I left them, With each his lass, and mine among the rest, Indulging every one his heart and soul. When I rose up, they begg'd of me [Uh] to danceâ And thusâI bore me; to convince them all 'Twas done by artâFor at the Ionic step I am a dabâBut having on a cloak, This way I mov'd in funâSome clapp'd and roar'd, I should returnâThen thus I took a roll Up to my love, that she might cuddle meâ When, as I turn'd, down flounc'd IâThere, be sure An elegy was sung to all our fun. Aiming to riseâSo!âNow again, I've nearly Bedawb'd my cloakâThen, there was mirth in plentyâ Upon my downfallâStrait, a cup of wineâ And down it wentâThen I but chang'd my cloak, And laid aside the otherâAnd came here Toâ[Uh.]âease my stomach after my debauch. From my young master come I to my old one, Just to remind him of his bargain struckâ Here! Open, openâSomebody tell Simo, That I am hereâ SCENE II. Enter SIMO and BALLIO. Sim. 'Tis a sad rascal's voice That calls me forthâBut what's this? How! What would you? And may I trust my eyes?â Pseu. Trust themâ'Tis Iâ Your PseudolusâAnd with a garlandâ[Uh!] drunkâ Sim. Troth, free and easy thisâBut how he stands! Does he then fear me?âBut I am thinking, whether To treat him with severity or mildnessâ No, I must use no violence at present, As I pretend my hope is all in him! Pseu. Behold the worst salutes the best of men! Sim. Heaven bless thee, Pseudolus! [Pseu. belches.] Foh!âCurse thee rather. Pseu. What ails me thus to toss so? [Uh.] Sim. Pox! what ails you To belch just in my face? Pseu. Nay, softly, Sirâ Hold me a little up, for fear Iâ[Uh!]âfallâ. 'Tis a strange thing, you see not I am [Uh.] drunkâ Sim. What impudence is this?âTo go about Drunk, with a wreath; and in broad day-light too? Pseu. It is my pleasureâ Sim. Is it too your pleasure, Thus to persist in belching in my face? Pseu. A belch is comfortable! [Uh.] Indulge me, Sirâ Sim. I verily believe this hang-dog here Could drain the Massick hills, however fertile, Of four years vintage, in an hour's carousalâ Pseu. A winter hour; put that inâ Sim. You say wellâ But say, whence bring you your o'erladen vessel? Pseu. E'en now I've had a bout with my young master. But, SirâHow finely Ballio's taken in? Did I not say, how I would do his business? Sim. A sneering rascal!âDoes he laugh at me? Pseu. I have done itâAnd the girl may with your son, Live a free womanâ[Uh.] Sim. I have heard all in order. Pseu. Give me the money then without delay.â Sim. I can't deny your right to itâTake your moneyâ Pseu. But once you said, you'd never give it me.â You do, tho'âCome, load me this fellow's shoulders, [meaning Ballio's.] And with it, follow me in hereâ Sim. I load him! Pseu. Load himâI know you willâ Sim. What's to be done With this same beast?âHe takes my money here, And laughs at me besidesâ Pseu. Woe to the vanquish'd!â Then turn about your shoulderâThereâ Bal. Alas! Alas! I never thought to see the day, That I should be a suppliant to thee. Pseu. Have doneâ Bal. I sufferâ Pseu. And 'tis well thou dostâ I should if thou didst notâ Bal. How, Pseudolus! And will you take this money of your master? Pseu. Assuredly, with all my heart and soul. Bal. And have you not the heart to favour me With some abatement?â Pseu. Now you'll say I'm stingyâ But, you shall ne'er the richer be for me. You'd ne'er had pity on my back to-day, If I had fail'd.â Bal. And if I live, a time Will come, to be reveng'dâ Pseu. Why threaten so? My back is at your serviceâ Bal. Very wellâ Pseu. Then come alongâ Bal. And why along with you? Pseu. Along, I sayâYou'll find I speak the truth. Bal. Along thenâ Pseu. Ay, to take a rouse with me. Bal. Must I go in?â Pseu. Do as I order you. Go in; and you shall have the money with me, Or moreâ Bal. I go thenâLead me where you will. Pseu. Well, Simo, are you angry with me now, Or with your son, for what has pass'd to day? Sim. Not in the leastâ Pseu. [to Bal.] This wayâ Bal. I follow you. But the spectatorsâYou invite them too? Pseu. By Hercules! they ne'er invited me, And so I will return the compliment. But if, with approbation and applause, [to the spectators. You grace our Actors and our Comedy, I ask you allâto come to it to-morrow. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Volume.</field>
