      <field name="fulltext">HYPSIPYLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Thoas, King of Lemnos, Father of Hypsipyle. Hypsipyle, in love with, and betrothed to Jason. Eurynome, a widow Princess of the royal blood, mother of Learchus. Jason, Prince of Thessaly, in love with, and betrothed to Hypsipyle; General of the Argonauts in the expedition to Colchos. Rhodope, Confidante of Hypsipyle, in love with, but deceived by Learchus. Learchus, Son of Eurynome, in love with, but rejected by Hypsipyle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE lies in Lemnos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The entrance of the temple of Bacchus, adorned with festoons of vine leaves, hanging from the arches, and wreathed round the columns. Various images of Satyrs and Silenus. Hypsipyle and Rhodope, crowned with vine leaves, each with a thyrsis in her hand. A troop of Bacchanals at a distance. Hyp. Haste, Rhodope, in pity to my grief, Fly, save my father: let him not approach These fatal shores, tell him what danger waits In this detested palace; open all The dire conspiracy of female malice. Rho. And yet this instant has thy tongue pronounc'd The dreadful oath to take thy father's life! Myself beheld thee at the horrid altar With countenance unmov'dâ Hyp. All, all was feign'd To blind Eurynome; thou saw'st how fierce She breathed her impious rage from breast to breast; Say, who can stop a torrent's headlong course? When every one besides confess'd her fury, Had I remain'd suspected, I had lost The means to assist my father. Filial duty Taught me to wear the mask of fell revenge: But while my lips breath'd out the murderous vow, My heart invok'd the Gods for his protection; And even my seeming boldness sprung from fear. Rho. Yet think not meâ Hyp. If thou delay'st, we are ruin'dâ O fly, my friend! lose not a moment's time; Already are his vessels near the portâ O Heaven! whom do I see? Eurynome! Rho. What threatening vengeance sparkles in her eyes! Hyp. Whisper some counsel to me, gracious powers! SCENE II. Enter Eurynome, with a train of women, dressed like Bacchanals. Eury. Princess! and you my brave companions, hear. The faithless Lemnians from the Thracian shores, Once more regain their long-forsaken home: The glorious task is ours to avenge the wrongs Of our neglected sex; the ungrateful traitors At length return; but distant from our soil, Thrice have they seen successive harvests rise. They come, but with them bring the ill-omen'd fruits Of their detested loves, and stolen embraces: Even in our sight they bring our hated rivals, With features painted like the mountain savage, And nurs'd with milk of beasts; and these, O shame! Shall boast the spoils of your affronted beauty. Revenge! revenge! our solemn oath is given: All must conspire to aid the great design. The night will to defenceless sleep consign The offenders spent with toil; the rites of Bacchus With festive shouts will drown each dying groan. O then let fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, Fall undistinguish'd in one common ruin; A great example of vindictive justice, To warn mankind to keep their plighted faith. Hyp. Yes, she who harbours pity merits death. Rho. How well she feigns a fury! [aside. Hyp. Rhodope, Depart with speed, (thou know'st what I would say) And when the Lemnian troops shall gain the land, Repair to give us tidings. Eury. Fruitless caution: Myself beheld the squadrons leave the ships. Hyp. What says Eurynome? Eury. Even now I saw them. Hyp. O let me stop my father! [aside, going. Eury. Whither go'st thou? Hyp. To meet the king, and with a forc'd embrace Conceal my hatred, and prevent suspicion. Eury. 'Tis now too lateâbehold where Thoas comes. Hyp. O Heavens! I faint! [aside. SCENE III. Enter Thoas attended. Tho. [to Hyp.] Thou dearest of my cares! Come to thy father's breast; remote from thee I heavier felt the weight of lengthen'd years; But now, my daughter, thou art present with me, My age seems lost, and youth again revives. [embraces her. Hyp. O my torn heart! [aside. Tho. What mean, Hypsipyle, Those looks of sadness? Is it coldly thus A daughter meets her father? Hyp. Ah! thou know'st notâ [aside. My lord!â Eury. Take heed, Hypsipyle. [aside to Hypsipyle. Hyp. O torture! [aside. Eury. Her weakness will betray me. [aside. Tho. Is my presence Become so hateful to thee? Hyp. Ah! my father! Thou little know'st my thoughts! [Eurynome threatens Hypsipyle, to prevent her speaking. Tho. Speak. Hyp. Heavens! I cannot. Tho. Speak, daughter, if thy heart averse disclaim The destin'd nuptials with Thessalia's prince, Whom every moment we expectâ Hyp. O sir! From the first instant I beheld, I lov'd him. Tho. Perchance, accustom'd in my stead to reign, Thou fear'st that my return must end thy power; Thou art deceiv'd; I am no longer here A sovereign or a king. Absolve, condemn; Rewards and punishments are in thy hand; I ask no further, dear Hypsipyle, Than here to live with thee, and die beside thee. [embraces her. Hyp. No more, my father!â [weeps and kisses his hand. Tho. Whence these gushing tears? Eury. The soft effusions of too sudden joy. Tho. Excess of joy, through quick surprise, Oft bids the tears o'erflow; But sure some passion fills thine eyes With drops that spring from woe. Few can deceive, with shews of art, A father's watchful care; Whose sight explores a daughter's heart, And reads her sorrows there. [Exit. SCENE IV. Hypsipyle, Eurynome, Rhodope, Bacchanals. Eury. Hypsipyle. Hyp. What would'st thou? Eury. If thy nature Refuse to lift thy weapon against Thoas, Resign the task to us. Hyp. Why dost thou seek To rob me of the deed my arm aspires to? Think better of my faith. Eury. 'Tis boldly promis'd: Thou bid'st me trust thee, yet but now I saw When in a father's sight thy looks grew pale. Hyp. Even from the hardy warrior's cheek, Oft-times the colour flies; When first the trumpet's clangors speak, And bid the battle rise. Yet scorns his soul, with brave disdain, Ignoble doubts to hear; Though on his face awhile remain The transient marks of fear. [Exit. SCENE V. Eurynome, Rhodope, Bacchanals. Eury. See, Rhodope, already day declines: We must delay no longer: some few moments Shall give th' expected signalâbut methinks Thou look'st disturb'd. Rho. The reverend age of Thoas Excites my pity; and in him I still Respect the name and person of a king. Eury. He is our greatest foe: in cruel exile By him Learchus died; and Rhodope Might better sure remember both our wrongs: In him I lost a son, and thou a lover. Rho. His crimes but well deserv'd his punishment: For me he feign'd a passion, while he sought With impious love to force Hypsipyle. Eury. I see full well thou seek'st with vain excuses To hide thy weakness. Rho. I'm a woman still. Eury. Then as a woman burst thy slavish bonds, And vindicate thy sex on perjur'd man. 'Tis falsely said that woman-kind, As by the laws of Heaven design'd, To gentle passions still confin'd, With love alone the heart control. 'Tis ours alike, when vengeance warms, To mix in battle's stern alarms, With beauty's or with valour's arms, To allure or terrify the soul. [Exit with Bacchanals. SCENE VI. Enter Learchus. Rho. [to herself.] Why seem the Gods regardless of mankind! Is there no pitying power that will protect This wretched land? O most detested night! O horror!âHa! what do I see! Learchus! Lear. Silence, dear Rhodope, betray me not. Lear. I spread the rumour to deceive the king. Rho. What brings thee unadvis'd to perish here? Fly, fly, Learchus! Lear. Let me yet a moment Breathe out my faithful vows. Rho. Learchus, no. Too late thou would'st betray my easy faith: 'Tis jealousy that brings thee back to Lemnos. Hast thou not heard Hypsipyle must wed The prince of Thessaly? Thou hast, and now Thy treacherous mind revolves some black design. Lear. Believe me not so guiltyâ Rho. Hence! no more: Fly, save thyself: to-morrow's fatal dawn Shall here behold the race of man extinct. The vengeful daughters of our Isle have sworn To wreak their rage on the devoted sex: This is the hour of slaughter. Lear. Canst thou hope That I'm so weak? Invent some better fiction To terrify Learchus. Rho. Yet believe me; O fly! thou art lost, if thou contemn'st my pity. Lear. Forgive me if I must suspect thy pity. Thou think'st I have betray'd thee, canst thou then So warmly prize the safety of a foe? No, Rhodope, that virtue ill we credit Which soars above the weakness of mankind. Rho. Each thinks another's passions still Are by his own exprest; And thus confounds the good or ill, In every other breast. If thou canst scarcely now conceive That pity dwells in mine, With equal pain must I believe That treason dwells in thine. [Exit. SCENE VII. Learchus alone. NoâI despise a woman's foolish threats: Befall what will we must disturb the nuptials Of the too happy Jason. Near the shore A desperate band, inur'd to live on spoil, And long the terror of the sailor-train, Attend my nod. I know each avenue And quarter of the palace; here awhile I'll lurk conceal'd, and act as time demands. Let those who but begin to plunge in guilt, Shrink at the danger; I've already pass'd So far from crime to crime, 'twere fruitless now To stop my mid career with late remorse. Who ne'er has left the flying shore, When first he sails the ocean o'er, Thinks every star with fate combin'd, And dreads a storm in every wind. With trembling heart each sound he hears: But custom soon dispels his fears; Then to the billows' roar he sleeps, Or careless sings amid the deeps. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Part of the garden belonging to the palace, with fountains on each side, and a view of a grove sacred to Diana. Time, night. Hypsipyle, Thoas, Learchus concealed in the grove. Hyp. At length thou art safe, my father: here unseen In Dian's sacred grove, till my return Amid these shades remain. Tho. Are these, my daughter, Thy Jason's nuptials! this our tender meeting! Hyp. Ah! sir! conceal yourself: the time admits not Of vain complaints. Tho. O Heaven! must thou return, Expos'd to all the rage of female malice? [Learchus advances and listens unseen. Hyp. By this alone I can secure our safety: My presence must confirm what I've invented, That all may deem thee dead. Tho. How canst thou hope To blind Eurynome? Hyp. A Lemnian slain Wrapp'd in thy regal vest, shall cheat the eye; O'er him I'll mourn, and seem to weep my father. Tho. I doubt thy pious fraudâ Hyp. O no! in Heaven There still are Gods that watch the life of kings, And aid the just designs of innocence. Tho. There is no friendly power for usâ Hyp. If all Conspire against us, and vindictive rage Should for thy blood preserv'd demand my own, Flow deep the vital stream; at least these eyes Shall ne'er behold thy death: the world shall know That midst my sex's universal guilt, I still pursued the unerring path of virtue, Nor e'er forgot a daughter's sacred ties. [Exit. SCENE IX. Thoas alone. Heroic maid! Fate, I forgive thee all; Thou mad'st me father to Hypsipyle, And every suffering's light: take, take my throne, Deprive me next of life, but cherish still Such sentiments to inspire my daughter's breast, And, pitying Gods! I'll thank you for your bounty. My soul, indulging in the thought, With tender bliss runs o'er; Her words to me that peace have brought, My breast had lost before. Despis'd alike be every ill Which mortals can sustain, One moment's joy which now I feel, Is worth an age of pain. [retires into the grove. SCENE X. Learchus, Thoas apart. Lear. What have I heard? Did Rhodope indeed Declare the truth?âHow if Hypsipyle Returning here should take me for her father? O fair device!âthen might I seize the princess, Deceive and force herâha! it shall be so: But holdâno matterâdoubtless love inspires The happy fraud:âbe bold my heartâwhat, Thoas! [approaches to the grove. Where can he lie conceal'd? Tho. A voice unknown Repeats my name! What means it? Lear. Wretched daughter! Whom now thy father undesigning kills. Tho. What hast thou said? for whom dost thou lament? Who art thou? speak. Lear. Unless I find the king, Hypsipyle is lost. Tho. Ha! lost! Say, wherefore? Behold me here. [coming out. Lear. Thanks to the mighty Gods! But fly, my lord! fly from this impious place: In Lemnos 'tis suspected you're conceal'd. Soon will the vengeful female bands appear; And should your presence verify suspicion, Your daughter for her piety must suffer. Tho. At least I'll stay and die in her defence. Lear. Ah! if thou truly lov'st her, rather fly; Thy flight alone can save her. Tho. Tell me, friend, To whom I stand indebted for this kindness. Lear. Thou know'st me notâI amâbut haste, depart; For look, already through the parting boughs, I see the mingled gleam of rebel arms. Tho. When will ye cease your malice, cruel stars! [Exit. SCENE XI. Learchus alone. Heaven prospers to my wish the wiles of love: Ye timorous lovers, learn from me to mix Boldness and stratagemâto seizeâto ravishâ All means are glorious. Be the conquest ours, And whether wit or fortune give the prize, Alike the victor merits his reward. Each lover that would win the fair, May with the warrior well compare, For whether fame or beauty charms, Alike the school of love and arms. The lover uses fraud and lies; Insidious arts the warrior tries; And both, when victory they gain, Forget their former toil and pain. [retires into the grove. SCENE XII. A hall illuminated, with an image of Revenge in the middle. Hypsipyle, Rhodope. Hyp. Yet hear meâshun me not. Rho. How shall I stay? My soul is chill'd with terrorâCan I view A cruel daughter who has dar'd to steep Her impious weapon in a father's blood? Leave meâ Hyp. Suppose thou art deceiv'd? Rho. Deceiv'd? Shall I not then believe these eyes that saw The murder'd monarch in his regal palace? I saw, and tremble yet with fear and horror. Hyp. O no, my friend, in him who seem'd like Thoas, Thou saw'stâbut harkâsome one approachesâgo, Attend me at Diana's sacred grove: There shalt thou know the whole, and further may'st Assist me with thy friendship. SCENE XIII. Enter Eurynome. Eury. One amongst us Betrays her faith. Hyp. And whence is this alarm? Eury. One of our tyrants yet survives, even now He was surpris'd within the narrow pass That leads into the palace. Hyp. Heavens! I trembleâ My father sureâ [aside. Rho. Perhaps it is Learchus. [aside. Hyp. Could'st thou discern his person? Rho. Has his name Yet reach'd thy ears? Eury. By favour of the shade He scap'd our knowledge; but in armour sheath'd Against our force he made a bold defence. Rho. Is he then taken? Hyp. Is he vanquish'd? Eury. No: But soon the female squadrons must o'erpower His single arm. Rho. O ill-advis'd Learchus! [aside. Hyp. Ah! wretched father! [aside. SCENE XIV. Enter Jason with his sword drawn, pursuing some Amazons. Jas. [within.] 'Tis in vain ye hope To elude my just revenge, while thusâ [sees Hypsipyle as he is about to attack her. Eury., Rho. O Heaven! Jas. My love! Hyp. Ah prince! Jas. Is this the Lemnian palace? Or these the inhospitable Lybian shores? Hyp. Ah! my lov'd prince! what God has sav'd your life? Jas. I came to celebrate the rites of Hymen, But found myself beset with hostile arms. Hyp. Thou should'st ere this have sent to give us notice Of thy arrival. Jas. No; I hop'd to increase Thy rapture by this unexpected meeting. For this I left my followers in the vessel, And tow'rds the palace took my purpos'd way: When sudden by an armed troop assail'd, I drew my sword; and soon the assailants fled. Enrag'd I follow'd; but when now I thought To o'ertake and punish the perfidious band, I met with thee. Hyp. Go, Rhodope, command That all forbear the prince of Thessaly; His life be sacred; for our vow extends To Lemnians only. [Exit Rhodope. SCENE XV. Hypsipyle, Eurynome, Jason. Jas. Vow! what means Hypsipyle? Eury. The ungrateful sex have fallen a sacrifice To woman's just revenge: there lives not now A single man in Lemnos. Jas. Heavens! what force Suffic'd to perpetrate this horrid purpose? Hyp. Night and fatigue betray'd the unthinking victims; Some, while they yielded to a false embrace, Expos'd their bosoms to the vengeful sword: Some quaff'd fallacious death in poison'd bowls: Some breath'd their last in sleep: a thousand forms Conceal'd the treason with the mask of friendship. Jas. My blood is chill'd with horrorâbut the kingâ Hyp. He too expir'd amidst the general slaughter: Should I speak truth I must expose my father. [aside. Jas. Are these the regions where the Furies dwell? Come, dear Hypsipyle, retire with me, [takes her hand, To breathe in other climes an air less cruel, Where happier omens may attend our loves; Nor shall the death of this ill-fated king Remain unpunish'd: witness all ye powers! I swear full vengeance for the horrid deed. Eury. The offender's name shall calm thy utmost rage. Jas. O never! never! Eury. She's so dear to Jason, Thou wilt at once forgive and pity her. Jas. No charm shall stay my wrath, whoe'er is guiltyâ So may kind love preserve the pure affections Of her to whom are all my thoughts devoted. Eury. By her was Thoas slain. Jas. By whom? Eury. Hypsipyle, Thy wife. Hyp. O Heaven! [aside. Jas. Speak, speak, my life, defend Thy glory from the dreadful imputation: Can this be true? Hyp. O cruel fate! [aside.]âEven so. [to him, after having looked at Eurynome. Say'st thou! [lets go her hand. Hyp. I must endure it. [aside. Jas. Do I dream! Or is it frenzy all! What voice was that Struck through my heart! Was that Hypsipyle! Did Jason hear! Eury. Now, prince, complete thy vow; Now, if thou wilt, revenge the slaughter'd Thoas. Jas. Are there such savage minds! Hyp. My lord, my Jason, Condemn not yet thy wife. Jas. Hence from my sight! My wife! am I thy love! who now shall press That hand still reeking with a father's murder? I seem already to partake thy guilt While here with thee I breathe one common air, And my heart shudders as I now behold thee. [going, he stops at the entrance of the scene, and continues looking attentively at Hypsipyle. Hyp. How much, my father, to insure thy safety Thy daughter suffers! [aside. Jas. Who shall henceforth say The looks reflect the image of the mind? Let them contemplate yonder form, and learn How vice can lurk beneath the mask of goodness Hyp. Why dost thou thus in silence gaze upon me? Jas. I seek through all that lovely face Some marks of cruelty to trace; No cruelty I find: So deep from every searching eye, Can dire revenge and fury lie Conceal'd within the mind, [Exit. SCENE XVI. Hypsipyle, Eurynome. Hyp. Hear'st thou?âO Heaven! Eury. Sigh not, Hypsipyle: Thou losest thus the glory of the deed; And these weak signs of womanish repentance, Disgrace the former courage thou hast shown. [Exit. SCENE XVII. Hypsipyle alone. O let me haste, and from my lover's mind Remove an error fatal to my fame. Noâfirst a father's danger claims my care, Let him be safe and thenâbut ah! meantime Jason forsakes me!âYet Hypsipyle Shall first preserve the rights of filial duty, And those preserv'd, the rest be left to Heaven! I feel thy power, unpitying love! Thy hopes and fears too strongly move A heart with every pain distress'd: Yet ah! forbearâthis fatal hour Must love and duty rend no more With struggling pangs a daughter's breast; [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Part of the garden belonging to the palace, with fountains on each side, and in the middle a grove sacred to Diana. Time, night. Eurynome, Learchus concealed in the grove. Eury. In every part methinks these eyes behold Some dreadful objects that augment my fury. Ye lonely horrors of the silent night, Raise no remorse to terrify my soul! Say rather that my son's unhappy shade No longer roves without a wish'd revenge: Say that no more he sighs in vain to cross The dire Lethean flood; and that his peace Is cheaply purchas'd by his mother's crime. Lear. It is Hypsipyleâbe bold Learchus. [comes out of the grove. Eury. Some one approaches! Heavens! what can it be? Lear. Thou dearest!â [takes her hand. Eury. Say, what art thou? Whence that voice? Lear. Ha! I'm deceiv'd! [retires. Eury. Ye powers! what chilling fear Runs through my veins! Methought I heard the voice Of my Learchusâwhere art thou, my son! Ah! do not hide thee from a mother's sight: O! speak and tell me why thou art return'd: What would'st thou? Wherefore dost thou hover round me? Unhappy shade of him I mourn, Dear son, no longer mine; If vengeance prompt thee to return, Know 'tis already thine. What victim can appease the dead, What peace canst thou obtain, If all the blood this hand has shed, Was shed for thee in vain? [walks about in great agitation. SCENE II. Enter Hypsipyle in haste. Hyp. Sure Rhodope has reach'd this place before me; But hark! she's here: fly swift, my friend, to Jason, [meeting Eurynome, she takes her for Rhodope. Tell him the king yet lives, and that this hour Shall see us both together at the port: Yet stay awhile, for Jason with his friends Perhaps may meet us, and secure our flight. [goes towards the grove. Eury. [to herself.] What secret treason here has chance discover'd! Now well I know, my son, why round me hovers Thy plaintive ghost; and have I then in vain Been plung'd in guilt? And must the tyrant live? O noânor shall it e'er be said I've lost, The fruit of all my crimes, a great revenge. [goes out in a rage. SCENE III. Hypsipyle, Learchus apart. Hyp. This is the sacred grove where lies conceal'd My dearest father. At my first arrival, The shade, my terror, and impatient duty, Perplex'd my trembling steps; but now full well I know the placeâMy lord! my father! haste. Lear. Sure 'tis the voice of her I loveâbe boldâ [coming out of the grove. O Heaven! my heart beats quick as I approach her. Hyp. Come nearâwhere art thou?âYet I hear thy steps, But cannot find theeâ'midst this dreary gloom PerhapsâO no, thou art here. [takes his hand. Lear. Assist me, Love! [aside. Hyp. Thou tremblest, O my father! fear not; Jason Will make our flight secure: for even but now He reach'd the port of Lemnos. Lear. Fatal chance! What do I hear? [aside. Hyp. Already from afar I see the blaze of torches. Lear. Then I'm lost. [aside. Hyp. And now, methinks, I hear my Jason's voice. Lear. Let me again retire. [returns to the grove. Hyp. But whither go'st thou? Why dost thou fly, my lord?âAlas! how far Misfortunes can unnerve the firmest soul! SCENE IV. Enter Eurynome with Bacchanals and Amazons with arms and lighted torches. Eury. Companions, compass round the wood, and stop Each outlet of the garden. Hyp. Wretched Thoas, Thy fear was sure prophetic. [aside. Eury. Thou art discover'd: Say where thy father lurks. [to Hypsipyle. Hyp. Assist me, Gods! [aside. Dost thou require the dead? Eury. 'Tis now too late For this dissimulation: thou wert heard To call his name, and hold a converse with him. Hyp. O! 'tis too trueâhis mournful image ever Appears before my sight; where'er I go Pursues my trembling steps; calls me ungrateful; Reproaches me with savage cruelty, That durst cut short a father's reverend days. Eury. Her words congeal me, though I know she feigns. [aside. Hyp. I tremble while I strive to hide my fear. [aside. Eury. No moreâdeceit is vainâ Hyp. O Gods! look there! Behold Eurynome, see where he comes! Observe his fiery eyes that swell with rage, While tears of anger trickle down his cheek; His snow-white locks still dropping crimson blood, Hang o'er his hoary face. Dost thou not hear His threatening voice, and mark his dreadful mien? Unhappy shade!âEnough have I endur'd Of punishmentâO Heavens!âIn pity, hide, Hide from my sight the torch of hellâtake hence The furies' iron whipsâ Eury. Ill-fated princess! My soul is mov'd! Hyp. She softens at my words. [aside. Eury. Yon' trees afford a shelter in their gloom For melancholy phantoms: haste, my friends, Hurl round the flames, and swift consume to ashes That unpropitious wood. Hyp. Ah, no! forbear Those trunks devoted to the Sylvan Goddess. Eury. Hearken not to herâ Hyp. Impious! shall not then The Gods themselves be sacred from thy fury? And who shall execute the dire command? Eury. Unthinking maid! thou hast betray'd thyself. Behold the grove where Thoas lurks conceal'd; Go, friends, and drag him thence to punishment. [the Amazons enter the grove. Hyp. Hear me! O! hear a most unhappy daughter! What shall I do? O all ye powers of Heaven! Eurynome have pity! Eury. 'Tis in vain; Thy father shew'd no pity to my son. Hyp. If thou'rt so thirsty for revenge, strike here; O pierce this breast, and let me bleed for him! Behold me suppliant, grovelling at your feetâ [kneels. Eury. Her tears disarm my rage. [aside. Hyp. O yet relent, Or change the destin'd victim of thy fury. By all that is rever'd in earth or Heaven, Even by the ashes of thy dear Learchus! Eury. That name has rouz'd anew my sleeping rage; The tyrant dies, even by this hand he dies: [draws her sword. Ne'er will I rest till I behold my sword Drench'd in his blood. [as she turns, thinking to find Thoas, she meets Learchus, conducted by the Amazons from the grove; she stands in amazement, and lets fall her sword. Lear. My mother! Eury. Heavens! my son! Hyp. What can this mean? Amazement seizes me! [rises. SCENE V. Enter Rhodope. Rho. What do I see? Learchus here and bound! What power can save him!âYesâI must dissemble. [aside. Eury. Art thou my son! Am I Eurynome! Lear. As certain as desire to avenge thy son Has made thee cruel to him. Eury. Wretched mother, That blindly has destroy'd thee! Dost thou live Only to make me guilty of thy death? O my lov'd son! how dearly must I buy The bitter pleasure of this fond embrace! Rho. Companions, bind the victim to yon' trunk, And let our thirsty arrows drink his life. [the Amazons bind Learchus to a tree. Eury. Ah! holdâInhumanâ Rho. First by force remove Eurynome, nor let maternal sorrows Disturb our purpose. Hyp. O unhappy mother! Eury. Have pity, Rhodopeâ Rho. Wouldst thou o'erturn The laws thyself hast made? Eury. Hypsipyle, Compassionate my tears! Hyp. Alas! what power Remains in me! Rho. If but a moment more Thou linger'st here, we speed the stroke of death. Eury. What mortal pangs can equal what I suffer! The last farewell how shall I speak? A mother's pain what words can tell? I feel my heart with anguish breakâ Dear offspring of my love farewell! This fond embrace from her receive, Whose fatal error seals thy death: O! that I thus my woes could leave, And in these arms resign my breath! [Exit. SCENE VI. Hypsipyle, Rhodope, Learchus, Bacchanals, and Amazons. Lear. Unpitying princess! in Learchus' fate Behold the dreadful trophies of thy charms! Excess of love impell'd me to this ruin. Hyp. Learchus, no: thou art thyself alone The cause of thy misfortunes. Lear. At my birth This day was fix'd in fate's eternal volume. Hyp. Unhappy moment when I pleas'd thee first! That hapless instant when thy eyes Beheld and thought me fair, Some baleful star was seen to rise, And shed a dismal glare. Less cruel would thy hatred prove, Than such a dire destructive love. [Exit. SCENE VII. Rhodope, Learchus, Bacchanals, Amazons. Rho. My friends, unwelcome here to Nemesis Would prove the victim: be the sacrifice Public and solemn: haste and raise an altar Amid the full assembly of the people. Convene together all the conquering band: Meantime myself will in this place remain To guard the prisoner. [the Bacchanals and Amazons go out. Lear. Never did I think Such tyranny could harbour in thy breast. Rho. Ungrateful man! learn better how to judge The soul of Rhodope; I feign'd resentment To avert from thee th' effects of female rage. Lear. Should this be true, my heart is thineâ Rho. O! noâ Think not I mean to bargain for thy love. Lear. Perhaps thou doubt'st me stillâBy all the Godsâ Rho. Learchus, holdâI would not have thee purchase My gift with perjury: from Rhodope Receive at once thy liberty and life. [unbinds him. Lear. Yet what return can gratitude afford thee? Rho. I'm now rewarded, but thou know'st it not. Thou canst not judge the generous mind, What sweets from mercy flow; My wrongs might here their vengeance find, But pardon I bestow. With secret joy the offended views The offender's blushes rise; Whose fearful conscience guilt subdues, While shame his speech denies. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Learchus alone. Why does my feeble virtue take the alarm, Yet cannot rouze from this lethargic sleep? What means this late remorse? Down, rebel conscience! I will not have thee struggling in my bosom: Rule, or obey; subdue, or be subdued. Let choice direct, or fate constrain The affections of my breast, Yet wherefore should they thus in vain With doubts my peace molest? If they're compell'd, why do we name Our passions good or ill? And wherefore are they still the same If they can change at will? [Exit. SCENE IX. An open country covered over with tents, a prospect of the sea: the sun rising. Jason alone. Amidst a thousand doubts opprest, My heart still flutters in my breast, But no resolve my thoughts approve. While beauties in her face I find, My soul detests her ruthless mind; I'm torn by hatred and by love. And can a lovely face so far deceive? Hypsipyle, more fierce than beasts of prey! Barbarity like thine exceeds whate'er Hyrcania's forests yield, within whose shades No tigress lurks so cruel to destroy A father's lifeâand do I then excuse her? Frame new pretences to prolong my stay? O no!âmy lofty heart disdains to avow Its weakness past. I once believ'd her worthy Of Jason's flame, and fain would still defend The choice of loveâBehold the morning rise! And yet my spirits keep the accustom'd watch, Though spent with fruitless careâbut now, methinks, I feel the tumult of my breast subside; My eyes grow heavy, and my mind suspends The painful struggle of conflicting passions. [sleeps. SCENE X. Enter Learchus. Lear. Enough of ill, my soul. At length 'tis time, After so many dangers past, to change This baneful course. I cannot bear for ever To tremble near the fatal precipice; To reverence others, and detest myself.â What do I see! my rival slumbering here? O! happy thou, born under friendly stars! The inhuman fair, who scorns my love, reserves Her charms for thee; but I in vain must mourn Abandon'd to despair; while 'midst th' embraces Of mutual fondness thou shalt scorn my sufferings, And find new pleasure from Learchus' pains. O cruel image that distracts my heart! Noâlet not him survive by whom I perish; [draws a dagger. Here let him dieâbut ha! what would I do! [stops. Are these the generous thoughts I form'd but now? Is this my late remorse? SCENE XI. Enter Hypsipyle. Hyp. [entering.] Where shall I meet My hapless father?âHa!âLearchus here! What means his poniard drawn? Lear. [to himself.] The world can ne'er Be conscious of this virtue: should I now Forbear to kill him, my revenge is lost, And yet no glory gain'd: the time will come, I may repent this ill-advis'd compassion: Then let me strike the blow. [about to stab him. Hyp. Ah! traitor! hold: What would'st thou do? [holding his hand. Lear. Leave me, Hysipyle. Hyp. Hope not I'll e'er permitâ Lear. Consent with me To quit this place, and I resign my weapon. Hyp. First let a thunder-bolt from angry Jove Dash me to atoms! Lear. Then his fate is fix'd; There is no mercy for him. Hyp. Stay, Learchus: If I but waken him, thou art lost. Lear. Ah! hold; I am gone, Hypsipyle. Hyp. First let thy hand Resign the poniard to me. Lear. There, ingrate! [after a pause gives up the dagger to her. Prince! thou art betray'd! [wakes Jason, and flies. Hyp. O stay!â [Jason rising, and about to draw his sword, sees Hypsipyle with the dagger in her hand. SCENE XII. Jason, Hypsipyle. Jas. Betray'd! by whom! Almighty powers! [sees Hypsipyle. Hyp. My lord! Jas. Relentless woman! What have I done to thee? What crime of mine Incites thy vengeance? That I've lov'd, may merit Severest punishment, but not from thee. Thou would'st, inhuman, from the face of earth Sweep all the inhabitants, that none might here Be witness to thy guilt. Hyp. Has then my fate More sufferings for me? Prince, thou art deceiv'd; I came not here to take thy life. Jas. That dagger, Those looks confus'd, the voice I heard but now Which rouz'd me from my sleep: do not all these Enough condemn thee? Hyp. 'Twas another hand Assail'd thy life; I sav'd it from the danger. Jas. Yes; I have wondrous proofs of thy compassion: She who could pierce a father's breast, would doubtless Preserve a husband. Hyp. O! I slew him not. Jas. But if thy lipsâ Hyp. My lips, by fate compell'd, Belied my deeds. Jas. What if I here beheld The murder'd monarch? Hyp. 'Twas deception all: Thou didst not, couldst not see him. Jas. Tell me then Where now is Thoas hid? Hyp. Alas! I know not; I've sought him, but in vainâ Jas. Perfidious woman! And think'st thou Jason can be thus deluded? Is't not enough, but thou must mock me too? Thou hast confess'd thy crime; each tongue confirms it; Myself am witness to it; yet thou hop'st To assume the name of innocent! even now I start from sleep, I find thee by my side, With looks confus'd, a dagger in thy hand, Prepar'd to pierce my heart; and wilt thou dare To tell me all was meant for my defence? Think not that Thessaly has form'd her sons So easy of belief. Hyp. Soon shalt thou seeâ Jas. I've seen enough. Hyp. And wilt thou notâ Jas. O! no; I'll hear no more. Hyp. And dost thou then believeâ Jas. Yes, I believe that I partake thy guilt In listening to thee longer. Hyp. Must we part? Jas. Leave me. Hyp. Where is thy former love! Jas. With shame I call it now to mind. Hyp. And am I thenâ Jas. Thou art poison to my eyes! Hyp. Yes, yes, ye furies! Inhabitants of this destructive land, I find that to be innocent is guilt. Have I not seen enough of slaughter stain My native soil? Assuage your horrid thirst, Behold my blood shall flow! [offers to stab herself. Jas. What dost thou mean! [holds her. Hyp. Why should'st thou, Jason, thus restrain my hand, And make me longer drag the life I loathe? Jas. Die, if thou wilt, but seek some other place To end thy wretched being. [wrests the dagger from her. Hyp. Yet at leastâ Jas. Leave me in peace. Hyp. O hear me! Jas. Never, never. Hyp. Kill me, in pity kill me! Jas. NoâI cannot. Hyp. For one last lookâ Jas. 'Tis guilt but to behold thee. Hyp. My lord! my husband! Jas. Hence! or I am gone. Hyp. Since 'tis your harsh command, I go; But for this cruelty you show, Your heart perhaps will anguish know, With sighs your breast may heave. And when you learn my hapless state, In vain your tears may mourn my fate; For sorrow then shall prove too late My sufferings to relieve. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Jason alone. Jas. At length she's gone! Thanks to the mighty Gods! A moment longer those seducing tears Had sapp'd my best resolves: far distant hence Let me retire to breathe another air, Where absence may erase this shameful passion. SCENE XIV. Enter Thoas. Ah prince!âmy friend! Jas. My lord! am I awake? Or art thou sovereign of the Lemnian land? Tho. At least I have been so. Jas. I'm all amazement! How art thou risen again? Myself beheld thee Stretch'd pale and lifeless in the regal palace: Either I then but dream'd, or now I dream. Tho. Thou saw'st a murder'd wretch array'd like me, In princely robes, whose semblance to myself Deluded every eye: this pious fraud Hypsipyle contriv'd for my defence. Jas. O Heaven! my love! and art thou guiltless then Of each imputed crime!âThoas, farewell, This instant I'll return. [going. Tho. Why would'st thou leave me? Jas. O! let me find the treasure of my soul; Soon shalt thou know how I have injur'd her. Tho. Yet hear: what would'st thou do? The female bands, Flush'd with their late success, scour every part; And should'st thou thus unguarded venture forth, Thou could'st not 'scape thyself, nor save Hypsipyle. Jas. To arms, to arms! awake, 'tis Jason callsâ Follow me, friends. [going towards the tents. Tho. Myself will guide your steps. Jas. O no! thy presence might disturb our purpose, Amidst my fury I should fear for thee. Haste, my companions, haste! each moment's preciousâ My wife! my friend! O Heaven, my soul is rack'd Between contending pangs of love and friendship. I leave thee, prince, nor can I tell But this may prove the last farewell! This arm must her I love restore, Or Jason shall return no more. [while this air is singing, the Argonauts come out of the tents.] [Exit Jason, with Argonauts. SCENE XV. Thoas alone. Noâwhile my dear Hypsipyle's in danger, I will not linger here a tame spectator: A father's love shall with new vigour brace My feeble limbs: each timorous beast assumes A sudden fierceness to defend its young; Loudly they threat, lay by their natural fear, And what was weakness late is courage now. The turtle when she once espies The unpitying churl that robb'd her nest; Feels the fierce flame of fury rise, Till then a stranger to her breast: And though no strength of claws or bill, To guard her helpless young avails; At least the cruel spoiler still She with unceasing cries assails. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A remote part of the Island betwixt the city and the sea-shore, with cypress trees and monuments of the ancient kings of Lemnos. Learchus with two pirates. Lear. Our hopes, my valiant friends, have prov'd abortive; Fortune opposes oft the best designs: Go, and let each be ready to depart. [the pirates going. But ha! what do I see!âbehold where Thoas Comes unattended to this lonely place. Now for the last expedient fate can offerâ Return, my friends. [pirates return. SCENE II. Enter Thoas. Tho. [entering.] I was directed still To abide in Jason's camp; but anxious thoughts Forbade me there to rest. Lear. Observe my purpose: Away. [pirates go out. Tho. [to himself.] My bosom throbs with hopes and fears: I find no peace, but every moment dread Some stroke of fate: by this untrodden path, I'll seek the regal palace. [going. Lear. Now, Learchus, Let artifice befriend thee. [aside.]âSee, my lord, The guiltiest of your subjects at your feet: Permit him thusâ [to Thoas, kneeling. Tho. Ye powers!âart thou alive! Art thou Learchus! Lear. I'm indeed Learchus. Tho. What wouldst thou have from Thoas?â Lear. Death, or pardon. Tho. Hence, traitor, dare no more approach my sight. Lear. Hear me, and then reject me at your will. Tho. Perfidious! know'st thou not what punishment Awaits thee here? Lear. Death I deserv'd, my lord, When I presum'd to attempt with ruffian force The fair Hypsipyle: but if a fault Of youth can find no pity from my king, A fault which love inspir'd, which keen remorse Has since severely punish'd; here at least, Here let me perish in my native land. Five tedious years, an outcast from my country, Wandering in foreign climes, the sport of fate, I've liv'd an object loath'd by earth and Heaven; And, ah! what wounds me more, my prince abhors me. I'm weary grown of long protracted woe: Life is the greatest evil I endure; And he, who drives this spirit from her dwelling, Is bounteous while he kills me. Tho. [aside.] Such despair Pleads in his cause, and mitigates his crimes. Lear. Why linger thus my friends? [aside, looking out. Tho. From thy misfortunes, Learchus, learn in future to respect The majesty of kingsâBe comforted; And liveâI pardon thee. [going. Lear. Alas! my lord, Still am I left uncertain; grant me then Some surer pledge of mercy. Tho. After pardon, What can I grant thee more? Lear. Your royal hand. Tho. Receive it, and depart. [giving his hand. Lear. O gracious prince, Whose goodness imitates the pitying Gods: This moment has effac'd my past misfortunesâ Not yet return'd! [aside.]âStill trembling, doubtfull still, Behold me at your feet, and prostrate thusâ Tho. What men surround me? [pirates enter armed, and surround Thoas. Lear. Soâthe stroke is given. [rising. Yield me thy sword. Tho. Whom speak'st thou to? Lear. To thee. Tho. To me! Almighty powers! but howâ Lear. No more: Thou art my prisoner. Tho. What unheard-of treason! Lear. At length thou art fallen into my snare: thy life Is at my will. Endure thy lot with patience: 'Tis thus the world for ever shifts the scene, And adverse fortune still succeeds to good: 'Tis thine in turn to plead for mercy. Tho. Villain! Lear. Hold, Thoas, change this language: my example Might teach thee prudence: 'twas but now I bent With humble prayers, a suppliant at thy feet. To suit our tempers, as the various turns Of life demand, is sure a needful virtue. The force thou see'st is all at my command: I can at willâ Tho. What canst thou further do? Take from this ebbing life its poor remains, Already irksome from the double weight Of years and sorrow? Lear. Thus Learchus said, But while he spoke, his tongue belied his thoughts. Tho. Great is the difference 'twixt my heart and thine. Lear. Vain boasting all! each animal that lives, Desires to hold his being: constancy, Which heroes vaunt in fate's extremest trials, Is but an art to cheat the unthinking vulgar: I read thy secret breast, and know thou tremblest. Tho. Yes, I might tremble, if the soul of Thoas Were form'd like thine: a thousand horrid crimes Would then for ever haunt my guilty sight: Still should I seem to hear the bolts of Jove For ever hissing round me; Jove the avenger, Who punishes the guilt of human-kind. Lear. To me the wrath of Heaven is not so dreadful. Tho. Vain boasting all! Thou canst not harbour peace: For still congenial with our nature, grows The love of virtue; if it prove too weak To guard from crimes, at least it will suffice To be their punishment: it is a gift From Heaven, decreed to be a scourge to those Who dare abuse it; and the greatest curse The wicked find, is that they still retain, Even in their own despite, the seeds of honour, And feel a conscious sense of sovereign goodness: I read thy secret breast, and know thou tremblest. Lear. My friends, take hence this sage philosopher, Whose knowledge can explore the human mind. Conduct him prisoner to the ships; and thou, Lay by that useless sword. Tho. Thereâtake it, traitor! [throws away his sword. Lear. Now must thou bid adieu to kingly pride; Since Thoas is the vanquish'd, I the victor. Tho. First, impious wretch! these features view, Then judge impartial of the two, Where lies the victory. Though free, thy looks are pale with fear, While I these chains undaunted wear, And pity feel for thee. [he is led off by the pirates. SCENE III. Enter Rhodope. Lear. [to himself.] Yet that majestic mien, those sentiments That speak the kingly soulâbut hold, my thoughts: Let me reflect on nothing but the gain Of all my heart aspires to. Rho. [entering.] O Learchus! Lear. Say, Rhodope, whence springs thy sudden fear? Rho. Not far remote a ghastly troop of strangers Bear royal Thoas prisoner to the sea. O! if within thy breast one spark remain Of bravery or virtue, seize this moment To give it proof: now may'st thou cancel all Thy guilty deeds, and make thy name immortal. Lear. Indeed!âSay, how? Rho. Give liberty to Thoas: Goârisk thy life to save thy king from danger; Perish or conquer; with one generous action Efface the memory of thy former crimes, Nor let me longer blush to own I've lov'd thee. Lear. Thou counsell'st well, and shalt, for thy reward, Be undeceiv'd: know then, by my command Is Thoas now secur'd. Hence, if thou wilt, Relate the news to proud Hypsipyle: Warn her no longer to despise a foe, However weak: so little will suffice To injure others, that in humble state, Even when depress'd, a foe may still be fear'd. Tell her in me she soon may find Th' effects of love so ill return'd: Go, bid her then recall to mind How once her pride Learchus scorn'd: And if offended at my deeds, She gives me now a traitor's name; Declare the offence from her proceeds, Who kindled this destructive flame. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter Hypsipyle. Rho. [to herself.] Can crimes like these debase the mind of man? O wretched daughter! most unhappy princess! What wilt thou feel when thou shalt hear the tidings! Hyp. My friend! our sufferings all are past; and Heaven At length is tir'd of heaping woes upon us. My faithful consort, and his valiant friends, Have quell'd the fierce inhabitants of Lemnos: My innocence is clear'd, my father safe: We are victors, discord stills her horrid voice, All, all is love, and peace, and happiness! Rho. And yet is Thoasâ Hyp. Thoas now awaits Jason's return to the Thessalian camp. Rho. O were it so! Hyp. What mean'st thou! Speak, my friendâ Rho. Thoas is now a prisoner. Hyp. Ha! to whom? Rho. A prisoner to Learchus. Hyp. To Learchus! How know'st thou this? Rho. But now I met him bound, Encircled by the followers of that traitor. Hyp. Who are his followers? Rho. Wretches like himself. Hyp. O heavenly powers! to what untried misfortunes Will you reserve me yet!âO fatal day! SCENE V. Enter Jason with the Argonauts. Jas. Hypsipyle, my life! what new affliction Obscures those lovely eyes? Hyp. My dearest lord, Thou com'st in happy time; for O! 'tis thou, And thou alone, canst ease meâHasteâdefend himâ Have pity on meâ Jas. Speak, my love, what would'st thou? As yet I know not what thy speech intends. Hyp. O! Thoas!âOâmy father!âcurst Learchusâ I cannot speakâ Rho. The traitor, false Learchus, Bears off in fetters Thoas to the sea. Jas. Perhaps the sameâ Hyp. Yes, 'tis the same Learchus, Who sought to kill thee while oppress'd with sleep, But failing in the dire design, endeavour'd With base suspicions to disturb our peace. Jas. Infamous villain! Hyp. Generous prince, behold An enterprise that's worthy of thy courage: Thou may'st preserve my dearest father's life: O save him, or Hypsipyle is lost! The fatal hour that sees the death of Thoas, Cuts short my thread of being. Jas. Leave me, love, To punish that perfidiousâbut meanwhile Dry up those mournful drops; to see thee weep Softens too much the temper of my heart. O! let not sorrow dim those eyes That rule me with unbounded power; Assuage thy fears, Dispel thy tears, If I'm to boast of courage more. Then cease to bid soft passions rise That all my firm resolves control; For thus my breast, With grief opprest, Forgets what rage should fire my soul. [Exit with Argonauts. SCENE VI. Rhodope, Hypsipyle. Rho. O princess! do not yield to black despair; Think not that fortune will for ever frown; Rely on Jason's valour still, and hope. Hyp. How can I hope, (since born to woe, My sorrows never cease) That this sad mind should ever know A transient gleam of peace? Each hour, my heart, by fate depress'd, A double anguish bears; It sinks, with present grief distress'd, Nor less the future fears. [Exit. SCENE VII. Enter Eurynome. Rho. My thoughts are all perplex'd amid this maze Of dreadful misery. Eury. O Rhodope! Where is my son? Rho. Think on thyself, inhuman! Consult thy safety, if thou prizest life, And hide thee from the angry victors' sight. Eury. I prize not life, unless I find Learchus. Rho. Forget a name that's hateful to the world; At once thy shame and mine. Eury. What means this anger? Didst thou not save him? Rho. Yesâwith shame I own it. Eury. I hope thou dost but feign this indignation; Since when thy lips once call'd for vengeance on him, He was thy heart's delight. Rho. But now my hatred. The rural maid, with terror mov'd, Detests the rose which once she lov'd, Since late her eyes a snake survey'd, Conceal'd beneath the fragrant shade. The bird attempts the bough no more, From which with pain he 'scap'd before; No more the wary warbler sings, Where once he snar'd his trembling wings. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Eurynome alone. In seeking thus my son, I lose myself; But what is life without him? Well I know Learchus guilty, yet I love him still. His crimes destroy my peace; but in my heart Affection reigns unquench'd, nay stronger grows The more I find him hated by the world. Tell me, Almighty powers! do we derive A curse or blessing from a mother's name? At once despair and grief I find With sudden frenzy fire my mind, A rage by parents only known: A hapless son, by danger prest, So deep is graven in my breast, That in his woes I lose my own. [Exit. SCENE IX. A view of the sea shore, with the ships belonging to Learchus; a plank laid from one of them to the shore. On one side appear the ruins of the temple of Venus; on the other the remains of an ancient port of Lemnos. Jason, Hypsipyle, Rhodope, Argonauts. Learchus and Thoas appear on the deck of one of the ships, Thoas in chains, and Learchus with a dagger in his hand. Jas. Compose thyself, Hypsipyle; at length We have reach'd the traitor: follow me, my friends, To yonder ships: now rouze your souls to fury; Be pity banish'd: let consuming flames Devour the sails, and ocean's whelming waves Engulph the vessels: spread the horrid slaughter, That sated vengeance may behold the tide Red with perfidious blood. Lear. Then be it so; But first let Thoas bleed. Hyp. O hold!â Rho. Inhuman! Jas. What rage transports thee thus? Hyp. My father! husband! O! hear, Learchus, hear meâpitying Heaven!â I can no moreâ Lear. Why, why, Hypsipyle, This unavailing grief? On thee depends His life, or death: ascend this ship, consent To be Learchus' wife; and if the daughter Reward my faithful love, the father lives. Hyp. What do I hear! O Jason! Jas. Dar'st thou, wretch, Pronounce the horrid compact? 'tis in vain I strive to curb my righteous fury longer. Hyp. Have pity, Jason! if thou should'st assail him, He lifts his impious hand against my father. Jas. Ten thousand furies struggle in my breast! Lear. See, Thoas, seeâbehold thy pious daughter; With what a zeal she hastes to save thy life. Thy blood shall answer her relentless scorn; I have endur'd enough. [about to stab Thoas. Hyp. O hold!âI come. [goes towards the ship. Tho. What would'st thou do, my daughter! Canst thou thus Forget what's owing to thyself and me? I little thought that e'er Hypsipyle Would prove her father's shame! Have I not bred thee In virtues worthy of a prince's nuptials, Not to partake an impious pirate's bed? And would'st thou now become the wretched mother Or robbers, not of heroes! Hyp. Teach me then Some better means to save thee. Tho. Save me thus. Assert the honour of my blood; reflect not It cost thy father's life; or if the thought Will rise, let it but strengthen thy resolve To guard my fame unsullied: live, Hypsipyle, Live with thy faithful lord, and reign for me, And if the days I lose to thine are added, I've liv'd, I've reign'd enough. Rho. O fortitude! Jas. O generous sentiments! Hyp. Does not such virtue Soften thee yet Learchus! Lear. No: it rather Incites my fury. Hyp. Must I thenâ Lear. No more; Yield, or he dies. Hyp. O! let these tears prevail: Thou art enough reveng'd for all my scorn: Let this suffice, Learchus: will not this Appease thy dreadful rage? Must thou behold me, A wretched object kneeling at thy feet? Then see me prostrate thusâ [kneels. Lear. My soul is fix'd; Come, or thy father dies. Hyp. Barbarian! traitor! [rises in a rage. Yes, I will come; and Hell with me shall bring Her blackest horrors: on the rites abhorr'd MegÃ¦ra shall attend, with dire Alecto: But I will prove a fury worse than all. Yes, I will come; but it shall be to tear That treacherous heart from thy detested bosom: Monster of cruelty, I come! Lear. Then haste, Or now he falls beneath my vengeful hand. [about to stab him. Hyp. Behold I comeâthe stroke forbear: [to Learchus. Is there no pity in the sky? Still let me thy remembrance shareâ [to Jason. My soul dissolves!âI faint!âI die! What flinty heart could here refrain To melt with sympathy of woe? What cruel eyes could view my pain, And yet forbid the tears to flow? [Hypsipyle weeping, walks slowly towards the ship, looking back tenderly on Jason. Jas. Wilt thou forsake me thus, Hypsipyle? And would'st thou, impious savage!âI'm distracted! Where shall I turn for counsel!âBarbarous Gods! SCENE LAST. Enter Eurynome. Eury. And have I found thee then at length, my son! Lear. Fly mother, save thyself. Jas. Inhuman woman! 'Tis not in vain that fate has sent thee hither. [stopping her. Stay thee, Hypsipyle:âlook here, thou traitor! Let Thoas free, or lo! this hand cuts short Thy mother's life. [draws a dagger, Hypsipyle. [stops short as she is about to enter the ship. Lear. Say'st thou! Eury. What can this mean! Rho. O unexpected change! Lear. Forbear in her To punish my misdeeds. 'Tis I alone Am Jason's foe. Jas. My rage permits not now A calm reflection: all are Jason's foes That hate not thee: a thousand cruelties Pollute her soul: but were she innocent, I should not blush to make her now the victim: 'Tis guilt enough to be Learchus' mother. Rho. He seems confounded. Hyp. Mighty Gods! assist us. Jas. Wretch, art thou yet resolv'd. Lear. I am resolv'd. Her life is yours: but let Hypsipyle Come and fulfill the contract we have made. Rho. Inhuman monster! Hyp. Most unnatural savage! Jas. Then thus to you, infernal deities, I here devote this horrid sacrifice. Lear. Why do I tremble thus! [aside. Jas. It rests on you, Upon the son to avenge the mother's death; Die, hapless wretch! [about to stab her. Lear. O hold! forbear to strike, The victory is thine. Rho. Nature at length Has touch'd his harden'd breast. Eury. My dear Learchus, To thee I owe my life. Lear. Eurynome, Thou little know'st thy sonâcall not this pity My virtue, 'tis my shame. I would have seen Thy death unmov'd, but resolution fails me: Spite of myself I tremble, shrink with terror, And feel my blood congeal within my veins. Why was I not by nature fix'd in goodness, Or more confirm'd a villain? Coward heart! 'Tis thou, and thou alone that hast undone me; Then thus with thee begin my just revenge. [stabs himself. Eury. O hold!âWhat hast thou done?â Lear. I neither hope, Nor will accept their pardon; as he liv'd, So shall Learchus die. [leaps into the sea. Eury. I faint!âO Heaven! [swoons, and is carried off. Rho. This is your work, ye righteous powers! Jas. My friends! Haste and unbind the king. [the Argonauts go to the ship. Hyp. My dearest lord! I scarcely yet can still my beating heart. Rho. What strange events this day has seen! Tho. Ah prince! [coming from the ship. My daughter! Hyp. Dearest father! Jas. O my lord! Hyp. And is it given me once again to kiss That honour'd hand? Tho. And do I once again Thus clasp thee to my breast? Rho. Now, faithful lovers, Propitious Hymen soon shall recompense Your sorrows past. Tho. First let us to the temple To thank the gracious powers: for, O my children! How vain is every human enterprise, If not begun with duty to the Gods! Chorus. What frenzy must his soul possess, Whose hopes on evil deeds depend? For though the wicked meet success, Yet peace can ne'er their steps attend. And even in life's serenest state, Shall Vice receive her secret sting; As Virtue, though depress'd by fate, Herself her own reward shall bring. THE END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
