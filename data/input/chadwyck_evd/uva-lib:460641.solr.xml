      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —Between decks of the De la Cruze—piles of shot, &amp;c. Peter Wilkins, Jack Adams, and others discovered; they are looking out at stern windows. A long gun. Chorus .—Air—“Hearts of Oak.” What a joke is our ship, For it's twenty to ten, That the Don will outsail us, What shall we do then? Steady boys, steady, I'm quaking already, Once safe upon shore catch me cruising again. Pet. (L.) “Blow winds and crack your cheeks,” they near us fast, This Boreas is not worth a single blast; I never knew so dull and slow a frigate, No wonder that the newspapers should rig it. Jack. Peter, 'tis vain the wessel to abuse, This comes of cruising in the De la Cruze. Pet. When once again on land boys, please the pigs, I'll trust no more experimental brigs. Jack. Talk not of brigs! but if we stand like drones, We shall be very soon with Davy Jones. [Gun run back, loaded, and run out during the following. Pet. Well, if they'll not abandon the pursuit, Of obstinacy they must take the fruit. [Takes up grape shot. Jack. That sort of fruit is very like to hurt— Pet. Only a bunch of grape—'tis their dessert. Now for a blaze of triumph—quick, Jack, quick, A lucifer to send them to Old Nick! Jack. (fumbling with box.) Peter, my boy, to me no blame attach, The gallant Nelson never found his match. Take care, when congreves fall, they fall 'tis plain, Like Lucifers, never to rise again. [Jack Adams discharges the gun. Pet. That's hit the chase my boys, it scems to rock her, There must be shot in every sailor's locker. She has not time to run for port I think. Jack. The only port she'll reach is one o' the Cinque. [Thunder heard. Hollo! I see the sails aloft they're clewing, I do begin to think a storm's a brewing. Pet. (putting on a Sou-wester.) When Neptune brews, we're pretty sure to get No half-and-half, but thorough heavy wet. [Crash. There go the masts, my heart begins to sail, Here's a distress without the power of sail. Jack. (sentimentally.) How little dream my duns whilst on their pillows, That he who owes their bills is on these billows. Voice above. Look out below! [Music. Crash. All fall on stage except Peter, who steadies himself on a gun. Pet. Good gracious! There's a shock. What's that I see ahead? The loadstone rock! There goes the gun. (gong.) [The gun is drawn quickly across the stage. And there go every shot. [The shots fly off. It really seems a most attractive spot. Jack. In such a spot I have no wish to settle. Pet. You needn't fear, you're not a man of mettle. [Music. Crash. The ship appears to strike, and the whole scene assumes the appearance of a wreck—as the ship is sinking scene changes to SCENE II. —A Rocky Cavern. A piece of sail cloth in front, on a square piece like a door plate, the “Hon. Mr. Wildman, please to ring the bell.” Music. Enter Pug, (a Monkey) L.—he tumbles about in ecstasy, then rings the bell, tumbles, &amp;c. and rings again. Enter Mr. Wildman, C.—he is dressed in a bear-skin suit, his head and beard a la Jeune France. Wil. Who rang the bell? (sees Pug) Oh, you, sir! well the news That you thus rouse me from my pleasant snooze, Besides I hate such early morning calls, I dreamt too that I dwelt in marble halls. [Music. Pug does action expressive of a ship at sea, and swimming. What meant he by that strange convulsive motion? That meant a ship, and that the briny ocean; In action he's a very famous talker, A dictionary quite—a perfect Walker. [Exit Pug, L. Long speeches from his paws with ease he sends, In fact he's language at his fingers' ends. [Music. Pug returns, continues action. That roll and twist! The ship is nearer? (Pug bows affirmatively, and rolls about pleased) True, I'll lay one pound the vessel will lay-to, I wish it may, for since I lost my wife, I've led a very so-so sort of life! With sentiment I don't wish much to trouble you, But oh! she was a woman! Mrs. W. [Pug expresses dissent. 'Tis true, she was a little of a dawdle, And had a trifling spice of Mrs. Caudle. Tho' just in confidence, don't talk about it, Is there one woman in the world without it? [Pug jabbers. Hot tempers may for wedlock still be good, Like “peppers and that sort of thing for food.” [Pug runs out, and describes the position of the ship. (Looks off.) Ah! to the Loadstone Rock, too late diskivered. [Music. There! Every sailor's got his timbers shiver'd! To linger would betray great impropriety, We'll form at once, Pug, “A Humane Society.” Collect the drags and follow in a trice, I'll be the president, and you the vice. SONG. (To the burthen of which Pug tumbles.) Pug, let us toddle now the fair's begun, Before you say Jack Robinson the ship is done; Her danger every moment palpably encreases Like an actor I could mention, she will be in lots of pieces. Hey go along! [Exeunt, L. SCENE III. —The Wreck of the De la Cruz on the Loadstone Rock, covered with the iron of the ship—practicable Raft, L. moving Sea, &amp;c. Peter Wilkins, loading raft, Jack Adams assisting. Jack. (pauses.) Oh such a fate I never did expect But to be wrecked and die we come di-rect; Attracted by the rock each thing of mettle Is off like lightning. [He opens box during the above, and at this moment takes out an iron tea kettle. And there goes the kettle. [The kettle is drawn to the rock. Poker and tongs all fly away in turn, Pet. (laughing) Well, thus metallic currency we learn; That you've rheumatic, Jack, I've heard you say, Now magnetism draws it all away. Jack. I only know if here one longer lingers He'd have the very nails drawn from his fingers. Pet. Or perhaps the Loadstone, like Macassar rare, Will draw the iron grey out of your hair. Cheer up, Jack. Jack. That's very well for you, But oh! my Mary with the eye of blew, If you could see us on this wretched shore Your eye would look more blewer than before. SONG.—Air, “The heart bowed down.”—Jack. My heart's a hundred weight of woe, A fortune 'twould be found, If any one would buy the lot At fourteen pence a pound. And this immense amount of grief Is all for love of you, Dear maid-of all-work at the Crown, And your two eyes of blew. Pet. Well, well, the time may come— Jack. I only know The time I wish to come is time to go. Pet. Oh hang your sentimental croaking, Jack, Whilst you are whining I shall take a snack. Jack. I'll join you, Peter, for I somehow feel The bursting heart requires a hearty meal. [Goes to case, R. What's this? I wonder if it's something nice! Is it wood pavement? No! It's Wenham ice! Pet. The difference is only in the name, For in effect they're very much the same. [Slides. Jack. What's this? It looks (drinks) and tastes like bitter ale! Pet. The fright was quite enough to turn it pale. Jack. Sure Bass's ale, when tossed by cruel fates, Found itself really Bass in Bass's Straits. Pet. Now lay the cloth, the knives and forks. [Jack opens a chest, and a bundle of knives and forks fly to Rock. Jack. I say! Peter, the knives and forks have cut away! Pet. If that's the case, then it's extremely plain, Those knives have cut never to come again. Jack. When all the stock of English iron fails This rock will serve the railways well with rails. Pet. The very worst device that you could hit upon, A rock is what so many railways split upon. Jack. I've heard of such a rock, pray, what rock was it? Pet. 'Tis sometimes called a “primary deposit.” Jack. Let's to the raft, for here we're so environed, One's handkerchief would go if it were ironed. DUET.—“Turn on Old Time.” Let's on, 'tis time to go, alas! When neither knife or fork will stay, Like Monsieur Phillippe's presto pass Our goods and chattels cut away. [The Raft goes off, and the Music gradually dies away. At the end, Pug enters, tumbles everything about, drinks, &amp;c. Rolls off. Soft Music. Flying Indians seen in the distance. Crosses from R. to L. CHORUS .—Air, “The harp in the air.” (Behind the Scenes.) We're coming again, so look sharp in the air, We all of us come From the land of the Glum! A mighty fine place, but we can't tell you where. Listen! Listen! Here! There! SCENE IV. —A romantic Pass. Jack and Peter (within, R.) Hillo! Sailors , (opposite side, within.) Hillo! Music. All enter. Shout. Pet. Welcome, my jolly boys! I'm glad you're found, For though ashore, we are not quite aground. I feared you'd been included in the loss, By Neptune's horrid game of pitch and toss. First Sai. (mournfully.) Our late adventures in the recent gales Would furnish heads for very frightful tales. Pet. Nay, don't lament, 'tis useless to regret, The poet says, “we may be happy yet.” Jack. Alas! I have no happiness in view Without my Mary, with the eye of blew, I can imagine how she will bewail The lengthened absence of her Indian mail. Pet. You're not the Indian mail for which's disbursed So much by newspapers to get you first. Come, Jack, give up that sentimental style, Just try to smile “as you were wont to smile.” Jack. If at my tenderest feelings thus you tug, From my o'ercharged heart you'll pull the plug. Pet. Don't be a milksop, 'tis a common fate For folks to be compelled to emigrate; As for the country, though we had no choice in it, Let's shew at least, we have a voice in it. A song, my friends, we've all the day before us, So, perhaps, you wont object to join in chorus. SONG AND SAILOR'S HORNPIPE. Air, “Bound prentice to a waterman.” Good sailors are no watermen—I learn'd that long ago, But to Hydrophatic treatment e'er say nay; When they take a little water why 'tis mix'd with rum you know, So, Jack Adams, hand the keg about and let 'em pull away. Sing fol, lol, &amp;c. Yeo! I blush to say teetotalism has no charms for me, Though some worthy folks admire it no doubt: But I always fancied toddy was much better than bohea, So we'll take the pledge to-morrow when we've drank the liquor out. Sing fol lol, &amp;c. Yeo! SCENE V. —A beautiful Water Scene. Rocks and foreign trees. Waterfall at back lighted by the setting Sun. A palm overhangs the water. Plantations, &amp;c. at wings. Music. Enter Pug, R. very boosy; he pursues a bird about and plays several drunken antics. Climbs up tree after bird. Enter Wildman, R. dressed up in the spoils of the ship; he wears a cocked hat. Pug loses his footing and falls on the hat, which then covers the face of Wildman. Wil. Hollo! was such ill treatment ever seen— Assist me, Broughton, Ballantine, Jardine; This is an insult that I cannot pardon, I'm bonnet'd! ho! Bow Street, Hat-ton Garden! [Pug strikes him with a stick and then runs off. Wildman releases him from the hat. Here, with impunity, they play their freaks, For though we've lots of birds we've got no beaks; But, perhaps, we're better off without the laws, For acts of Parliament have frightful claws. [Music, and wild noises as before, and the Flying Indians cross in the distance. CHORUS—(as before.) Wel. Zounds! what a phillaloo above! What is it That hither comes to pay a flying visit? I've heard it said from some of England's cities Have flown away provisional committees. A perfect covey! All that I'm afraid is They must be rather light and flighty ladies: I hardly know on which my chance should fall, I can't polygamise and marry all! If I could follow out my nat'ral bent, I'd put myself in an advertisement, Offer my heart and hand to the best bidder, N.B. There's no objections to a widder. [Exit L. [Music. Enter Yourakee and Hallicarnie, with other Flying Indians, some bearing fanciful baskets bottles, &amp;c., one or two in livery, &amp;c. You. This is the spot, where free from all alloy, Our pic-nic party we can well enjoy [they open baskets. Lay the provisions out—Oh goodness! my! They've made a sad mess of the pigeon pie! [shews one broken. Hal. And as for me, unlucky that I am, The bread is jamm'd together with the jam. You. I, of a worse mishap have to complain, I've played old gooseberry with the champagne. Let's make the best of it, to grieve is folly, A pic-nic means—uncomfortably jolly, Hal. And whilst they spread the cloth we've time enough To have a game at “Touch” or “Blind Man's Buff.” All the Women. Blind Man's Buff! Hal. Agreed—now who'll be “he?” All. I. I. I. Hal. So many Is must see. So Yourakee! [Music. The servants spread Cloths. A fanciful Ballet of Action. Yourakee blindfolded. Enter Wildman, L. Yourakee seizes him—pulls off handkerchief and screams. [Picture. Wil. Don't be afraid! I'm not so very frightful Really this sort of thing is quite delightful You'll find me if you give a welcome hearty A very nice young man for a small party You. You will not eat us? Wil. What a charmer this is, Eat you! I could devour you—with kisses! [tries to kiss Yourakee, who starts away terrified. Hal. I think you'd better ask the brute to stay. You. Sir, will you join our party, sil vous plait? Wil. Oh I shall be delighted (Music) I'm in luck (all sit) What an enchanting creature (taking up a plate)—what a duck! When I behold these rich and savoury piles I fancy that I'm in the Sandwich Isles [Takes sandwiches. For ever I could gaze upon those eyes, But for these more enchanting mutton pies. (takes some.) You. I think I never saw a greater glutton What Dando was to oysters he's to mutton. Wil. Now that will do—here, some one take the platter [rising. Suppose we dance? Let's have a Pas de Katter. You. Katter! A Pas de Quatre you mean, of course, Wil. Well perhaps I put the cart before the horse. [Music. The Indians recoiling from Wildman as he approaches them. Yourakee conveys by motion that they are all to take flight. Yourakee in passing the second time flies away. Wildman rushes up Rocks, climbs Palm Tree overhanging the stream. A Gun is fired and Wildman falls into the water. Enter Peter Wilkins, supporting Yourakee, followed by Hallicarnie, and all the Indians, L. Pet. You are not hurt I hope—your colour's heightened, You. I'm not much hurt, but very sadly frightened. Pet. Poor little dear! Some misadventure brought it And there's no penny-a-liner to report it. You. Look at my wing, see what a dreaful tear, Not Swan and Edgar could that rent repair. Pet. Dear creature! Let not that unhappy make you, Under my wing henceforward I will take ye. You. Oh thanks! that promise re-assurance brings, But now I look again you have no wings. Pet. That's true enough, but love is most sincere. Having “no feather left to fly with” dear. SONG.—Air, “In happy moments day by day.” A happy man if made to day By you, no week shall pass, But you shall stand in new array Before your looking glass; One Vauxhall night your life shall be, One long, long fancy ball, When you shall look, (now silks are free,) The smartest of them all. Enter Jack Adams with a brass blunderbuss. He starts, L. Jack. Good gracious! [Yourakee rushes to Peter. Does a British sailor fright you? Pet. You've shot the darling creatures wing Jack, right, thro'. Jack. I didn't go to do it you're aware, You know my sentiments about the fair, The man who'd strike a female— Pet. That's enough, Give us no more of that exploded stuff. Jack. Exploded stuff! It's always sure to tell. Exploded! perhaps it is—it goes off well. [Sees Hallicarnie. Ah! If I didn't know to the contrary, I should have sworn you were my blue-eyed Mary. I can't embrace you for those cursed wings, You find them, don't you, rather awkward things. Pet. Here come our friends! Enter Sailors, R. Pray let me introduce My gallant shipmates of the De la Cruz. Enter Sailors and Flying Indians R. FINALE. Sailors. Pretty creature, don't refuse me. For one little buss excuse me. Indians. Naughty creature! pray excuse me, I'll scream if thus you use me. Oh you nasty tarry fellow You've been drinking till you're mellow. Sailors. Don't you see the clouds look low'ring, Indians. Soon 'twill cats and dogs be show'ring. All the Sailors try to kiss the Indians. Business at the end the Indians rise on the wing Violent Storm. Sailors, gather Plaintain leaves, which the Girls use as umbrellas. The Pas des Parapluis, the Ladies holding up their dresses as Ladies do in wet weather. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Interior of Peter's Hut, built of trees and fragments of the ship. Recesses, in which Peter and Jack Adams are sleeping. The roof slants down the Stage, so that the Scene is double. Curtain rises to Music. Wildman and Pug are discovered on the roof, the former seated “lackadaisically.” Pug creeping and peeping about. Wil. Those lovely creatures I observed them well, Put up to night at this marine hotel, Slily I crept behind along the shore, Hoping to find my way to their boudoir. [Music. Pug having uncovered the Roof, crawls along the beams and pulls off Adams's night cap. Adams moves slightly; Pug then motions Wildman to follow. Wildman tries to get through the hole but sticks fast, he kicks violently, and then falls on Jack Adams, who cries out “Murder.” Wildman rolls off and creeps under the Table. Peter. (starting up.) What noise is that? What has disturbed your rest? Jack. I felt such an oppression of the chest. Pet. It was the pork you supp'd on or the grog. Jack. The pork, my Peter, 'twas the entire hog! It seem'd to weigh on me with all its might. Pet. Your suppers Jack are never very light, You had peas pudding too and that's like lead. Jack. Peas pudding pooh! I've got no peas [peace] in bed. Pet. I wish you'd go sleep. Jack. Well, well, you're right, I hope to-morrow night you'll burn a light; One of those rushlights which are always made To burn like modest merit in the shade. Pet. Dont talk, but go to sleep—good night. Jack. Bon soir, I hope you wont be nervous when I snore. Music. They sleep. Wildman walks about stealthily, and at last capsizes water jug over Jack Adams, who roars out. Peter jumps out of bed. Melodramatic action, during which, Peter tries the doors R. and L. and finds them fast. Wildman in great trepidation, Jack Adams sitting up in bed. TRIO.—Peter. What the deuce is now the matter? That you're making all this clatter I'm half inclined to batter Your head Jacky, so I say. Piano! Piano! Dont make such a clatter Piano! Piano pray Jacky Piano! Jacky Piano! Jack. What the deuce is now the matter That &amp;c. You surely wouldn't batter My head Peter, so I say, Piano! Piano! I did not make a clatter Piano! Piano! pray Peter Piano! Peter Piano WILDMAN. What the deuce is now the matter, I've made a pretty clatter; 'Tis Misfortunes fault od'rat her So I'd better sneak away. Piano! Piano! I've made a pretty clatter, Piano! Piano! Pray Very Piano! Very Piano! [At the end Jack Adams falls back in his bed fast asleep—he snores. Pet. (Tries door, R.) Dear Yourakee still sleeps, now I'll be bound No noise can wake her, for her sleep is sound; May nought disturb the darling girl 'till morn. [Jack snores. What's that? It seem'd a solo on the horn. [Jack again snores. The Ophiclide such depth and power would lack. [Jack da capo. Oh! 'ts the nasal Organ play'd by Jack! [Soft Music. Peter lies down. Wildman creeps out cautiously, shews a crooked nail and picks the lock of the door, R. SONG.—Wildman,—“Lucy Neal.” My hoity toighty flightly charmers, in that chamber it is very clear, But I'm determined that, like the late Mr. Ferguson, she “dont lodge here” It's very lonely living as I live eating a solitary crust when I can arn it There's nobody to make my gruel, and if I tear my bear's skin there's nobody to darn it. Oh Miss Yourakee! My lovely Yourakee When you're Mrs. Double U How happy I shall be. Oh there's not such a thing in these parts as a cab, a Brougham, a pi lentum or a po chay, I'm really obliged to walk off the young lady and make her run away. From what I've seen of her wardrobe, I don't think it very expensive I'll be my own “proud young porter,” so the affair wont be very expensive. Oh Miss Yourakee! &amp;c. &amp;c. Exit, R. D. [A scream heard instantly. Enter Hallicarnie, she carries a rushlight stand. Jack and Peter wake up, and come forward. Hal. Oh help! she's gone! your Yourakee! I've missed her, Oh Peter Wilkins, pray assist her sister; Pet. I will—but to elope if she's been willing, In the pursuit I'll not expend a shilling. Hal. Elope! Elope! I don't know what you mean, Jack. Of course—she never heard of Gretna Green. Pet. But if my Yourakee's been forced to run, I'll never rest until we two are one; I'll write a note to your august pa-pa And seek at once this Island's registrar. Concerted. Round about the Island we will trot, And what A pretty rod I've got Now in pickle, Just to tickle Naughty Mr. Wildman on the spot. [Exit Hal. and Peter, R. Jack, L. SCENE II. —A Rocky Pas and Distant Landscape. A Del supposed to be beneath stage. Music. Pug enters, dragging on large chest, marked “DE LA CRUZ;” he opens Box and pulls out dresses, &amp;c., shaving box, razors, puts on clothes, &amp;c., hears noise—gibbers—shuts down lid of box, leaving the looking glass on the top. Enter Wildman, L.—arm in arm with Yourakee—they are struggling, Wildman carries a carpet bag and umbrella. You. (Mock heroically.) Unhand me, monster! Is no one near, The cries of injured innocence to hear? Coward and slave! How dare you thus oppress That tender plant. A female in distress. Wil. I am no coward, few you'll find much braver, Though in appearance perhaps I'm a rum shaver; [Touching his beard The brave deserve the fair—behold me here As brave and bold as “Brook Green's Volunteer.” You. If such a thing as you our sex should need, The husband market would be low indeed; Believe sir could I tolerate your sight, I don't believe you mean the thing that's right. Wil. That cut is the unkindest cut of all, Not mean the thing that's right! now by St. Paul I'm not a gentleman disposed to brag. [Throws carpet bag on the stage. But look at that ma'am, that's my carpet bag! In it is every thing that I am worth I don't possess another stick on earth, With its contents I freely thee endow Are my intentions honorable now? SONG—Air, “When the fair land of Poland.” Tho' I can boast of no land and scarcely a roof Save the Gingham I spread in your sight; I offer you, madam, the strongest of proof That I mean but to do what is right. My birth is noble altho' I'm dressed Not quite in ton I'm forced to own, But I'm in my best. You. You've had you say, sir, now let me have mine; If you had shares in ev'ry railway line, I would reject you! Wil. Yes, and well you might, For I should be in a most awkward plight; You. I though that railway shares were all the go. Wil. Yes, so they were—but now they're gone you know. Enter Hallicarnie with a bonnet box. Hal. Thinking you perhaps might wish to change your mind, And to your suitor, you might grow resign'd. I've brought your wardrobe. You. You mistake me quite. Think you I'd be resigned to such a fright! No minister that ever ruled a nation Was so averse as I, to resignation. Wil. Look at the census—pause before you lose me, You must have lost your senses to refuse me. For ma'am I tell you to your consternation, That I comprise th'entire male population. (aside) Thus to be chaff'd is more than I can stand, (to Hll.) Allow me, miss, to offer you my hand, Hal. No, to my sister, sir, your hand belongs. You. I wouldn't touch it with a pair of tongs. Wil. O come! though to be rash I'm rather loth I'll be revenged, my girls, and marry both. [Music. He pursues them about the stage, Yourakee holds the looking glass towards him—he seizes it and appears transfixed. [Exeunt Yourakee and Hallicarnie. Wil. Are these my fearful features that I trace, I look a frightful muff about the face. I fear this hair has scared the gentle maid, I look a very hare'um scare'um blade; And yet I'm told this is the style one meets Where'er you walk about in London streets. [opens box. There's still one chance the lovely maid to win, I'll give a thorough lathering to my chin; Yes, I'll take courage. Women love the brave, Off goes my beard—“my kingdom for a shave.” [Wildman takes out shaving box. [Music. Yourakee, supported by Hallicarnie, bearing the band box, fly across in the distance. Gun heard. Wildman in terror jumps into chest. Pug runs up from below rubbing himself as though hurt rolls about, and then shakes himself, and a quantity of peas fall upon the stage, looks out and expresses alarm at the approach of some one. [Shout below “Hillo!” Wildman opens chest a little. Pug wants to join him. Wil. To let you in I see no rhyme nor reason, This box is private—taken for the season. [Shuts box and pinches Pug's fingers, Jack Adams. Peter and Sailors enter. Adams carries a blunderbuss. Jack. Where is your master? Pet. And the lady—quick? Jack. Where is she? Echo answers “cut her stick.” [Pug shakes his head. Pet. Oh, you don't know—Jack Adams, if you please The blunderbuss—another pint of peas. [Pug expresses alarm and points to chest. Jack Adams sits upon it and locks it. Yourakee and Hallicarnie, enter, L. Pet. (embracing both.) Come to my arms my ducks of diamonds, do, And let me kiss both of you black and blue. Jack. Thank you, one at a time's enough to smother, I'll love this angel, Peter, you love t'other. [Indians cross. Music. You. and Hal. Our father comes! Pet. The governor! I'm glad, Pray introduce us to your worthy dad? [A noise heard in chest. What's that? Jack. 'Tis Wildman, over let us throw him. Hal. Keep him, my father rathers wants to know him. You. Papa has often said if he should meet him And found him pretty tender he might eat him. [Wildman kicks furiously. Pet. Then raise the chest among you if you're able We order him to lie upon the table. CHORUS.—Air, “The Polka.” [Scene closes them in. SCENE III. —A romantic Pass. Procession of Flying Indians, Dancing Girls, &amp;c., preceding King Columbat, &amp;c., at the end Pug enters and tumbles across. SCENE IV. —A long vista of mountains. Moonlight. All, the characters discovered. Col. My worthy friends I thank you most sincerely, For having saved the girls I love so dearly, During their absence I have had the vapours; I've advertized them both in all the papers, Entreated their return in accents solemn Each morning in the Times, the second column. Pet. No thanks great chief. Jack. What Briton could do less Than feel for lovely woman in distress. Col. That sentiment I do not understand But each of you may have my daughter's hand. I don't know which, till now I've never seen you, That point, my sons-in law, settle between you. [Music. Peter takes Yourakee and Jack Hallicanie. Now for this, Wildman, bring him forth and kill him! [Chest brought on. Music. They open chest. (musing) I dont know if to roast, boil, fry or grill him! [Wildman comes out very smartly dressed. Wil. Great Colombat, though I object to boasting, I think that I could stand a little roasting; But when you see this change I think you'll own I'm so well dress'd I may be let alone. You. Your outward man a perfect change discloses, You'd make an excellent show-block for Moses. Hal. Now that he's civilized, pa, spare his life. Col. I will. You're saved. Now, prisoner, choose a wife. [The female Indians arrange their dress so as to attract attention. Wil. I'm like a purchaser perplexed and torn By fifty thousand bonnets of Leghorn, In Cranbourn Alley, marked “all three and six,” Not knowing upon which 'tis best to fix. [Looks at each. These lovely creatures all my judgment baffle, Oblige me, sire, and put me up to raffle. Col. We will oblige you! be it settled so—(going). Pet. “Soft you—a word or two before you go.” Wil. (To audience) Now, what he's going to say, of course, you know. Jack. Silence, you interloper! Speak up, Peter; You'll do it more genteeler and more neater. Pet. May I entreat your favor for to-night? Be lenient, friends, and say—“Drive on—all right!” You. If, Peter, you approve, remember all, Whilst paying Peter, you are paying Paul! FINALE. [Flying Indians appear on all the mountains bearing coloured torches, dancing, flying, singing, &amp;c. Before we firmer tie the knot of love, Or prompter rings to take us up above, Be kind enough to say that we obtain Your leave to fly to-morrow night again. END.</field>
