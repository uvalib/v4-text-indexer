      <field name="fulltext">AMELIA WENTWORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A Room. Wentworth, Amelia. Amel. You have determined then on sending Charles To India? Went. Yes. Amel. Poor boy! he looks so sad and pale, He'll never live there. 'Tis a cruel lot At best, to leave the land that gave us birth, And sheltered us for many a pleasant year; The friends that loved us and the spots we loved, For such a distant country. He will die. Remember,â'tis Amelia's prophecy. Oh! do not be so harsh to the poor youth. Do not desert your better nature. Nayâ You will not send him, Wentworth? Went. He will sail In twenty days. Amel. How can you be so cruel. He shall not go. Went. Madam, you interest Yourself too much, methinks, for this young man. His doom is settled; that be sure of. Amel. Sir! Went. I say your tenderness, yourâfolly for This boy becomes you not. Amel. Away, away. Went. Madam, while you are Godfrey Wentworth's wife, These tenderâfriendships must be laid aside. Oh! you can smile. Byâ Amel. Mr. Wentworth, you (I must believe it) jest: you jest with me. Went. Go on, go on: you think me quite a fool. Woman, my eyes are open; wide awake, To you, and all my infamy. By heaven, I will not be a bye word and a mock In all the mouths of men, for anyâPshaw! I still respect your ears, you see; Iâ Amel. You Insult me, Sir. Went. Forgive me: I indeed Am somewhat of a prude; you'll scorn me for it. I still think women modestâin the mass. Amel. SirâMr. Wentworthâyou have used me ill. Yourself you have used ill. You have forgot Allâwhat is due to meâWhat to your wife. You have forgotâforgotâcan I forget All that I sacrificed for you?âmy youth, My home, my heartâ(You knowâyou knew it then) In sad obedience to my father's word? You promised to that father (how you kept That promise, now remember) you would save His age from poverty: he had been bred In splendour, and he could not bow him down, Like men who never felt the warmth of fortune. He gave me up, a victim; and I saw Myself (ah! how I shuddered) borne away By you, the Evil Angel of my life, To a portentous splendour. I became A pining bride, a wretch,âa slave to all Your host of passions; but I swore (may God Forgive me!) to love youâyou, when I loved Another, and you knew it: Yes, you knew My heart was given away, and yet you wed me. Leave me! Sir. Went. Have you done? Woman, do you think This mummery is to work me from my purposeâ My settled will. Mistress, I leave you now: But this remember, that your minionâOh! I do not heed your frowningâyour boy-love Will visit India shortly or, it may be (You are his guide) a prison here, in England. Farewell. Amel. Yet stayâa word more ere we quit. I do beseech you (tho' my wrongs are great, And my proud spirit ill can stoop to this,) You take your malediction from this youth. He is as innocentâI think he's innocent Of the least ill toward you. For me, I am Too innocent to sue; yet let me say, Since the sad hour I wed you, I have been As faithful to our cold communion, As tho' my heart had from the first been yours, Or you been generous after. Once more, Sir, I would implore youâfor your comfortâfor Your honour, and my name, to spare this boy. In the calm tone of one who has not erred I do require this of you. Went. You but steel My heart against him. Woman, is your pleading Always as warm as now? By earth and heaven, Had I but wavered in his destiny, This would have fixed me. Seek your chamber now, And in your meditations think how well Your name may sound (my name!) held up to scorn. It may be worth your care. Thus long I've hid My wrath, and let you wander at your will. You have grown bold in guilt; be prudent now: Save a fair name, or I must tell the world How ill you keep your secrets. [Exit Went. Amel. He is gone. And I am hereâoh! such a weary wretch. Oh! Father, Father, what a heart had you To cast me on the wide and bitter world, With such a friend as this. I would have toiled From the pale morning 'till the dusk of night, And lived as poorly, and smiled cheerfully, Keeping out sorrow from our cottage home. And there was one who would have loved you too, And aided with his all our wreck of fortune. You would not hear him;âand,âand did I hear His passionate petitioning, and see His scalding tears, and fling myself away Upon a wintry bosom, that held years Doubling my own. What matters it?â'tis past. I will be still myself: who's there? [Charles enters.] Ch. 'Tis I. You are in tears? Amel. Away. Draw down the blinds; The summer evenings now come warmly on us. Go, pluck me yonder flower. Ch. This Roseâmean you? It fills the room with perfume: 'tis as red, And rich, and almost too, as beautiful, Asâ Amel. As Aurora's blushes, or my own. I see you want a simile. Ch. You are gay. Too gay for earnest talk. Who has been here? Amel. No one; I will not tell; I've made a vow, And will not break it, 'tillâuntil I'm pressed. Ch. Then let me press you. Amel. Silly boy, away, Go gather me more flowers, violets. Ch. Here let me place them in your hair. Amel. No, no. The violet is for poets: they are yours. O rare! I like to see you bosom them. Had they been golden, such as poets earned, You might have treasured them. Ch. They are far more To me,âfor they were yours, Amelia. Amel. Give me the rose. Ch. But where shall it be placed? Amel. Why in my handâmy hair. Look! how it blushes, To see us both so idle. Give it me. Where? where do ladies hide their favourite flowers, But in their bosoms, foolish youth. Awayâ 'Tis I must do it. Pshaw! how sad you look, And how you tremble. Ch. Dear Amelia. Amel. Call me your mother, Charles. Ch. My Guardianâ Amel. Ah! name him not to me. Charles, I have been Jesting awhile; but my dark husband's frown Comes like a cloud upon me. You must go Far, my dear Charles, from the one friend who loves you: To Hindostan. Ch. I know it. Amel. For myself, I shall think of you often, my dear Charles. Think of me sometimes. When your trumpet sounds, You'll recollect the coward you knew once, Over the seas in England? Ch. Spare my heart. Amel. I do not think you have a heart: 'tis buried. Ch. Amelia, Oh! Amelia, will you never Know the poor heart that breaks and bursts for you? Oh! do not take it ill; but now believe How fond, and true, and faithfulâ Amel. Is this jest? You act well, Sir; orâbut if it be true, Then what am I? Ch. Oh! by these burning tears; By all my haunted days and wakeful nights, Oh! by yourself I swear, dearest of all, I loveâlove you, my own Amelia! Once I will call you so. Doâdo not scorn me, And blight my youthâI do not ask for love; I dare not. Trample not upon my heart, My untouched heartâI gave it all to you, Without a spot of care or sorrow on it. My spirit became yoursâI worshipped you, And for your sake in silence. Say but once You hate me not, for thisâSpeak, speak! Amel. Alas! Ch. Weep not for me, my gentle love. You said Your husband threatened you. Come, then, to me; I have a shelter and a heart for you, Where, ever and for ever you shall reign. Amelia, dear Amelia! speak a word Of kindness and consenting to meâSpeak! If but a word, or tho' it be not kindness: Speak hope, doubt, fear,âbut not despair; Or say That some day you may love, or that if ever Your cruel husband dies, you'll think of me; Or that you wish me happy,âor that perhaps Your heartânay speak to me, Amelia. Amel. Is then your love so deep? Ch. So deep? It is Twined with my life: it is my lifeâmy foodâ The natural element wherein I breatheâ My madnessâmy heart's madnessâit is all âOh! what a picture have I raised upon My sandy wishes. I have thought at times That you and I in some far distant country Might live together, blessing and beloved; And I have shaped such plans of happiness, For us and all around us, (you indeed Ever the sweet superior spirit there,) That were you alwaysâFair Amelia, You listen with a melancholy smile? Amel. Let me hear all: 'tis fit I should hear all. Alas, Alas! Ch. Weep not for me, my love. IâI am nought: not worth a single tear: I will departâor may I kiss away Those drops of rain? Well, well, I will not pain you. And yetâOh! what a paradise is love: Secure, requited love. I will not go: Or we will go together. There are haunts For young and happy spirits: You and I Will thither fly, and dwell beside some stream That runs in music 'neath the Indian suns, Aye, some sweet island still shall be our home, Where fruits and flowers are born thro' all the year, And Summer, Autumn, Spring, are ever young, Where Winter comes not, and where nought abides But Nature in her beauty revelling. You shall be happy, sweet Amelia, At last; and Iâit is too much to think of. Forgive me while I look upon thee now, And swear to thee by Love, and Night, and all The gliding hours of soft and starry Night, How muchâhow absolutely I am thine. My pale and gentle beautyâwhat a heart Had he to wrong thee, or ubpraid thee! He Was guiltyânay, nay: look not so. Amel. I have Been guilty of a cruel act toward you. Charles, I indeed am guilty. When to-day My husband menaced me, and told me of Public and broad disgrace, it met my scorn: But have I, my poor youth, been so unkind To you, as not to see thisâlove before? Charles, I have driven you from your early home: I see it now: I onlyâhate me for it. Ch. I'll love you, like bright heaven. The fixed stars Shall never be so constant. I am all Your own. Not sin, nor sorrow, nor the grave, Not the cold, hollow grave shall chill my love: It will survive beyond the bounds of death, The spirit of the shadow which may there Perhaps do penance for my deeds of ill. Amel. Stay this wild talk. Ch. Men have been known to love Thro' years of absence, aye, in pain and peril, And one did cast life and a world away, For a loose woman's smile: nay, Love has dwelt, A sweet inhabitant, in a dÃ¦mon's breast, Lonely, amidst bad passions; burning there, Like a most holy and sepulchral light, And almost hallowing its dark tenement. Why may not Iâ Amel. I thought I heard a step. How strangely you speak nowâagain, again. Leave me; quick, leave me. Ch. 'Tis your tyrant coming: Fly rather you. Amel. If you have pity, go. Ch. Farewell then: yet, should he repulse youâ Amel. Then I willâbut go: you torture me. Ch. I am gone. [Exit. Amel. Farewell, farewell, poor youth; so desolate That even I can spare a tear for you. âMy husband comes not: I will meet him, then, Armed in my innocence and wrongs. Alas! 'Tis hard to suffer where we ought to judge, And pray to those who should petition us. 'Tis a brave world, I see. Power and wrong Go hand in hand resistless and abhorred, And patient virtue and pale modesty, Like the sad flowers of the too early spring, Are cropped before they blossomâor trod down, Or by the fierce winds withered. Is it so?â But I have flaunted in the Sun, and cast My smiles in prodigality away: And now, and nowâno matter. I have done. Whether I live scorned or belovedâBeloved! Better be hated, could my pride abate, And I consent to fly. It may be thus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. A Chamber. Night. A considerable period of time is supposed to have elapsed between this and the preceding Scene. Amelia, Marian. Mar. Are you awake, dear lady? Amel. Wide awake. There are the stars abroad, I see.âI feel As tho' I had been sleeping many a day. What time o' the night is it? Mar. About the stroke Of midnight. Amel. Let it come. The skies are calm And bright; and so, at last, my spirit is. Whether the Heavens have influence on the mind Thro' life, or only in our days of death, I know not; yet, before, ne'er did my soul Look upwards with such hope of joy, or pine For that hope's deep completion. Marian! Let me see more of Heaven. Thereâenough. Are you not well, sweet girl? Mar. Oh! yes: but you Speak now so strangely: you were wont to talk Of plain familiar things, and cheer me: now You set my spirit drooping. Amel. I have spoke Nothing but cheerful words, thou idle girl. Look, look! above: the canopy of the sky, Spotted with stars, shines like a bridal dress: A queen might envy that so regal blue Which wraps the world o' nights. Alas, alas! I do remember in my follying days What wild and wanton wishes once were mine, Slavesâradiant gemsâand beauty with no peer, And friends (a ready host)âbut I forget. I shall be dreaming soon, as once I dreamt, When I had Hope to light me. Have you no song, My gentle girl, for a sick woman's ear? There's one I've heard you sing. âThey said his eyeââ No, that's not it: the words are hard to hit. âHis eye like the mid-day sun was brightââ Mar. 'Tis so. You've a good memory. Well, listen to me. I must not trip, I see. Amel. I hearken. Now. SONG. Mar. His eye like the mid-day sun was bright, Hers had a proud but milder light, Clear and sweet like the cloudless moon: Alas! and must it fade as soon? His voice was like the breath of war, But hers was fainterâsofter far; And yet, when he of his long love sighed, She laughed in scorn:âhe fled, and died. Mar. There is another verse, of a different air, But indistinctâlike the low moaning Of summer winds in the evening: Thus it runs: They said he died upon the wave, And his bed was the wild and bounding billow: Her bed shall be a dry earth grave: Prepare it quick, for she wants her pillow. Amel. How slowly and how silently doth Time Float on his starry journey. Still he goes, And goes, and goes, and doth not pass away. He rises with the golden morning, calmly, And with the moon at night. Methinks, I see Him stretching wide abroad his mighty wings, Floating for ever o'er the crowds of men, Like a huge vulture with its prey beneath. Lo! I am here, and Time seems passing on: To-morrow I shall be a breathless thingâ Yet he will still be here; and the blue Hours Will laugh as gaily on the busy world, As tho' I were alive to welcome them. There's one will shed some tears. Poor Charles! [Charles enters.] Ch. I am here. Did you not call? Amel. You come in time. My thoughts Were full of you, dear Charles. Your mother (now I take that title,) in her dying hour Has privilege to speak unto your youth. There's one thing pains me; and I would be calm. âMy husband has been harsh unto me,âyet He is my husband; and you'll think of this If any sterner feeling move your heart? Seek no revenge for me. You will not?âNay, Is it so hard to grant my last request? He is my husband: he was father, too, Of the blue-eyed boy you were so fond of once. Do you remember how his eyelids closed When the first summer rose was opening? 'Tis now two years agoâmore, more; and Iâ I now am hastening to him. Pretty boy! He was my only child. How fair he looked In the white garment that encircled himâ 'Twas like a marble slumber; and when we Laid him beneath the green earth in his bed, I thought my heart was breakingâyet I lived: But I am weary now. Mar. You must not talk, Indeed, dear lady; nayâ Ch. Indeed you must not. Amel. Well then, I will be silent: yet, not so. For ere we journey ever should we take A sweet leave of our friends, and wish them well, And tell them to take heed, and bear in mind Our blessings. So, in your breast, dear Charles, Wear the remembrance of Amelia. She ever loved you,âever; so as might Become a mother's tender love,âno more. Charles, I have lived in this too bitter world Now almost thirty seasons: you have been A child to me for one third of that time. I took you to my bosom, when a boy, Who scarce had seen eight Springs come forth and vanish. You have a warm heart, Charles, and the base crowd Will feed upon it, ifâbut you must make That heart a grave, and in it bury deep Its young and beautiful feelings. Ch. I will do All that you wishâall; but you cannot die And leave me. Amel. You shall see how calmly Death Will come and press his finger, cold and pale, On my now smiling lip: These eyes men swore Were brighter than the stars that fill the sky, And yet they must grow dim: an hourâ Ch. Oh! no. No, no: oh! say not so. I cannot bear To hear you talk thus. Will you break my heart? Amel. No: I would caution it against a change, That soon must happen. Calmly let us talk. When I am deadâ Ch. Alas, Alas! Amel. This is Not as I wish: you had a braver spirit. Bid it come forth. Why, I have heard you talk Of war and dangerâAh!â [Wentworth enters.] Mar. She's paleâspeak, speak. Ch. Oh! my lost mother.âHow!âYou here? Went. I am come, To pray her pardon. Let me touch her hand. Amelia! she faints: Amelia! [She dies. Poor faded girl! I was too harshâunjust. Ch. Look! Mar. She has left us. Ch. It is false. Revive! Mother, revive, revive! Mar. It is in vain. Ch. Is it then so?âMy soul is sick and faint. Oh! mother, mother. IâI cannot weep. Oh! for some blinding tears to dim my eyes, So I might not gaze on her.âAnd has Death Indeed, indeed struck her,âso beautiful? So wronged, and never erring; so beloved By oneâwho now has nothing left to love. Oh! thou bright Heaven, if thou art calling now Thy brighter angels to thy bosom,ârest, For lo! the brightest of thy host is goneâ Departed,âand the earth is dark below. âAnd nowâI'll wander far and far away, Like one that hath no country. I shall find A sullen pleasure in that life, and when I say âI have no friend in all the world,â My heart will swell with pride, and make a show Unto itself of happiness; and in truth There is, in that same solitude, a taste Of pleasure which the social never know. âFrom land to land I'll roam, in all a stranger, And, as the body gains a braver look By staring in the face of all the winds, So from the sad aspects of different things My soul shall pluck a courage, and bear up Against the past.âAnd nowâfor Hindostan.</field>
