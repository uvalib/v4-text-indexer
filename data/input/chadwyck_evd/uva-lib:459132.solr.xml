      <field name="fulltext">THE INCONSTANT LADY, A PLAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Advertisement. The Manuscript, from which the Play now brought before the Public is printed, was bequeathed, in the year 1755, to the Bodleian Library, by Richard Rawlinson, D. C. L. Fellow of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and, for many years, a Gentleman Commoner of St. John's College, Oxford. In 1646 and 1653 â4Â°. Sept. 1646, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Mozely entered for their copies, under the hands of Mr. Langley and Mr. Whitaker, Wardens, these several Tragedies hereunder mentioned, viz.â(Here follows a long list of 48 Plays by various writers, among which) âSwitzer, âThe Corporall, by Mr. Wilson.â âSept. 9th 1653, Mr. Mozely entered for his copies, the several Plays following.â(Here follows a long list of 42 Plays by various writers, the last of which is) âThe Inconstant Lady, by Arth. Wilson.â, three plays were entered on the books of the Stationers' Company, as the productions of Arthur Wilson; their titles were, The Switzer, The Corporal, and The Inconstant Lady; but it does not appear, that either of them was printed. By a list of dramatic pieces formerly in the possession of John Warburton, Esq. Somerset Herald, we find that The Inconstant Lady (erroneously ascribed to William Wilson) was, at one time, in his collection of old plays in manuscript; but as most of these were destroyed through carelessness, (see Notes at the end of the volume,) this play was supposed to have shared the fate of its companions, and to be totally lost, till Dr. Rawlinson's copy was accidentally discovered. From this copy the present edition of The Inconstant Lady has been printed with the greatest care, retaining line for line, letter for letter, as in the original MS. This will account for a very singular orthography in some places, and an erroneous division of the metre in others; a system which was deemed necessary, in compliance with the present taste for bibliographical accuracy. Of the Author all the particulars that can now be recovered are, it is hoped, given in the Appendix. As it appeared very likely, that some entries in the register at Felsted might afford further information relative to our Author and his family, application was made to the resident Minister, Mr. John Simpson, who informs me by letter, that the volume containing the burials, &amp;c. from 1636 to 1678 has been lost for many years. He adds moreover, that the Vicar of the parish has some recollection of an inscription to Wilson's memory; but this cannot be retrieved, as that part of the chancel where the stone lays is now covered with pews for the convenience of the parishioners. We are obliged for some of the Notes and various hints and improvements to Sir Egerton Brydges, Mr. Ingram, Mr. Lodge, Mr. Utterson, Mr. Gilchrist, Mr. Henry Ellis, and Mr. Haslewood. And we owe to Mr. Cochrane, of Fleet-Street, an exact copy of the entries from the Stationers' Registers, relating to our Author's three plays.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS PRIMUS. Scena Prima. Antonio, Trebutio. Treb. Who's that? Antonio? Well mett. Anto. Trebutio, thou art as welcome, for 'tis rare to see Freindship in this age meet soe happily. Here's neither cringes nor curvetts, to make An asse vnload his big and burthenous tougne Vpon the dunghill of stale complement, That none but fooles admire. Treb. 'Tis the best posture For your lip-mongers, that are all meere out side; Whose tougnes do wander so farr from the hart, That they are faine to stoope to 't. Anto. I am angrie To see the guiddie world run thus a'wheeles In such vntoward tracks, guided by men That haue their greatnes more in noyse then nature Whose couert plotts, should they but view the light, Wo'd crack the axel-tree, and, though they breake it, Wee must not say they do't. O, thirst of gold And honor! how it tougne-ties Vertue, Goodnes; And, like a violent working medicyne, runs Through all the body-pollitique, and makes Each member quitt his naturall offices To entertaine diseases. Treb. 'Tis a plague Raignes euery where; what citty is so free From theise wild rages, where not freindship onely Or tyes of consanguinitie, but bonds Of sacred wedlock are not violated By this corrupted mattayle? Anto. Nay, the alters Prophan'd with such poluted hands, as haue Noe other God but their admired Mammon; Who do not blush themselues to act these crimes They raile against. Treb. But how com'st thou turnd satire? 'Tis not thy humour. Anto. It wo'd burst a stoick To see such follie. I'le go neerer home now, And talke of that, which moues this anger in mee. Our freind's vndone! Treb. Who, Aramant? Anto. The same. Thou knew'st his father violently bent Against his mariage with Emiliaâ Treb. And hee is dead, so that he may proceede Without an obstacle. Anto. But in his death, (As if he ment that curses like a whirlewind Should breake the vrne where his black ashes lay, And blowe 'em into ayre,) he hath pul'd downe The piller of the house: giuing the land And all the estate vnto the younger brother; And, by a power constraind, doth abrogate The lawe of Nature. Treb. There's a silly, wild, Fantastique fury doth possesse old age; Who, in their thinne and flegmetique braines, conceiue Their vnborne reason, which is monstrous; From which they forme out their conceits, and those Proue but abortiues. For you seldome see The elder loose his right, but that the younger Is still the ruine of the famelie. Anto. And may it alwayes happen soe, where Vertue Looses her iust reward. Treb. 'T wo'd griue a man To part with such a fortune for a woman. Anto. It is his honestie that binds him to it, His promise to her. Treb. But doth shee loue him? There is a skittish, proud, ambitious trick In woman, such a vanitie, as loues The varnisht outside more then inward soundnes: 'Tis for the land they loue to take the heire. Anto. If shee bee such a one, may shee liue miserable, And none lament it. But, Trebutio, Can there bee such an angell-deuill? Treb. Yesâ That mauchandize with suitors, and the man That bids most carries them away. Anto. Hee has A goodly purchase that hath such a bargaine! But heere comes Aramant, and his brother with him. Enter Aramant and Millecert. Ara. If my vnworthynes may call you freinds, I haue not lost all: but if you should thinke, The deprauation of my nature, or The breatch of loyaltie I owe to goodnes Did cause this ruine, it wo'd more afflict mee Then my lost fortunes. Anto. Thinke not, worthie freind, You can loose any thing in vs, while Vertue Doth find her self in you. Can the huge text Of the vast law cancell the assurances, Or disanull the bonds of friendship; or Conferr affection as it doth large titles Or great estates to men? Noâ'tis a power Full of diuinitie, not grosse and earthie. Treb. Wee rather wonder at your sufferance, sir, That beare it thus with patience. Ara. O, my freinds, Though I haue lost a father, and with him A birth-right, yett I haue a brother heere, (A noble one, I hope,) and such a mistris, That had my father, in his great displeasure, Throwne mee into some barren wildernes Where shee had bene, her smiles wo'd ha' preseru'd mee, And added fresh fire to my emptie veines. Treb. But now the flame burnes dim. Ara. Cleare as her eyes. My brother is going with mee to behold The saint I worship soe, and hee shall iudge If that I had not cause to quit the world And all it's outward blessings for a creature Of such diuine perfection. Mille. Shall wee goe then? Ara. Yes: I do long to see her. My deare freinds, I hope wee are not still at such a distance, That I should make excuse for my departure: You know my mind too well. Exeunt. Anto. Farewell, sweet Aramant. Treb. Thou art more noble farr, then fortunate. Anto. 'Tis true Emilia's faire, that's all; shee setts Her selfe in the world's eye to be admir'd: But Fame reports her sister (for no man Could euer yett haue freedome to come nere her,) Exceeds her as bright day the sullen morne: It is so soft and sweet an innocence, That Nature made it for a master-peece Of admiration; but her iealous sister Fearing all eyes would fix on such an obiect, Restraines her of the libertie of her birth. Treb. How? Anto. Keepes her close shutt within her chamber, and Doth make the onely flower of beautie liue In solitude. Treb. By what power doth shee this? Anto. Since her old father's death, she hath the managing Of the estate, and so her will's her lawe. Enter Pantarbo, Seruius, and Tonsus. Treb. But stay, Antonio, what pageant's this? This thinge compos'd of shreads? Anto. A peece of greatnes Men call a lord; and those a brace of courtiers. Treb. Are lords such compounds? Anto. How can honor bee But much abas'd, when 'tis the price of money, And not of merritt? Our great ancestors (Who by their vertue, and their noble deeds Gain'd an immortall name,) blush in their graues, Such guilded outsides should be rais'd to greatnes, That haue no other honor but their title. Yett you shall see this peece of follie now If it but spew vpon you, raise a complement Wee cannot well charme downe againe, without A counter-spirit from Amadis de Gaul, Sir Palmerin of England, or such authors, From whence he gleanes speeches of all degrees And quallites, and spits 'em out meere naturall. Come, let's away, and shun him, for a shower In a full haruest is not soe vnwelcome, As hee's to mee. Exeunt. Pant. Come, show your courtship now, And see, who can do't best. Tons. But lett's barr bookes then. Pant. Barr bookes! you show your ignorance; why do not Your greatest clarks learne all things from their books? Tons. Yes, to imbellish that which is their owne, But you take all. What's thatâThe Schole of Complement? Pant. Stay, I must con a little. Serv. Who begins? Pant. Seruius, do you. Serv. Hum. Beleeue it, gentle lord, You are compleately drest. This ruff is sett With such a nicitie, that it exceeds Proportion. Pant. That's a sweet complement indeed, To say my ruff exceeds my proportionâha, ha! Serv. I meane the liniaments of art and order; Ther's such a discipline and methode in 't, Soe quaintly curious, euery sett so neate, And yett it borrowes lusture from the wearer. Pant. Pish, this is comon. Tonsus, lett ha' your part. Serv. Come, wee must please him in his follie. Tons. Well. Now I approach to tell this noble lord, Rich clothes are like the trappings of an asse, And do not take my eye, nor can your ruff, Though printed at Madrid, but suffer censure By the most learned, if compar'd to you; To praise the clothes when ther's a face wo'd take The eyes of wonder. Pant. This is monstrousâ What do you make mee? ha! Tons. Wee are both silent. Pant. Theise are rude things like th'earth that brought 'em forth. Behold mee now. Suppose some mightie prince Were standing heere, then thus wo'd I direct My speech vnto him. Greatest of earth's monarchs! Lett the bright heauen of your admired judgement Shower downe some dropps of fauor on your seruant, Who, like a barren gaping land, is dryed For want of moisture. Serv. This is begging language. Pant. But if that sacred and reuyuing dewe (Drawne by the sun-beames of your brighter reason) Bee all contracted into clouds alreadie, Lett 'em breake out in showers, and with their wealth Inrich this lower orbe. How do you like it? Tons. Why ex'elent well. Serv. Hee wo'd haue all your great ones, Before they grow too high, like swelling clouds Breake and disperse to nothing. Tons. Then his father will hardly scape. Pant. Now to some princesse, or great lady thus. Serv. What complement to them? He cannot goe Aboue the heauens. Tons. Hee must descend to them, man. Pant. More than most faire, what power of magick charmes Shoote from your sweet refulgent eyes! Serv. Sweet eyes! Why not sweet tooth as well? Pant. Your peerlesse handâ Serv. Why, must shee haue but one? Pant. You putt me outâ Is that inchanted wand, whose touch doth make A wanton feauer dance through all my bloud; 'T hath a magnetique vertue, sympathizing With humane apprehention. Tons. O, rare nonsence! Pant. I'me out, I thinke. Serv. When were you euer in? Pant. Ther's a magnetique vertue in your touch That workes a simpathie transcending farr All humane apprehention. Tons. Now a'hits on't. Serv. But then this princesse, sir, and you must sympathizeâ Pant. Or elce 'tis nothing. But now marke this straineâ Your beautie, faire one, I so much admire, That like the satyre I could kisse my fire, (Although it burnes me vp with dollers dire,) So I may haue a sweet kisse for my hire; And without so much blisse I shall expire. Tons. Hee's out a'breath. Serv. Damsells, come to the crier! Pant. Pish; I haue speeches readie fram'd and fashioned For euery sex, size, age; 'tis all my studdie. Come, lett's go see the ladies. Tons. Hee's wi' child, Till he bee brought to bed with this course yssue. Serv. O lett him spawne it out, 'twill crack his braine elce. Exeunt. Scena II. Enter Emilia and Lavia. Emil. Lauia! Lav. Madame. Emil. Call my sister hether; But see the dores bee fast till shee returnes. Exit Lavia. The land being gon, where is the maintenaunce? Can sighs and protestations keepe a coach, And maintaine footmen? Or is mistress Constancie A good dispencer, can shee keepe a table? I cannot feed like Mab, the queene of fairies, On spider's leggs, nor receyue nourishment From kisses of my hand. If Aramant Hath lost his land, I doubt hee'le loose Emilia. Enter Cloris. Clo. Is it my fault or fate, that thus I am Restrain'd the freedome of my birth? Can I Not haue the libertie that Nature gaue mee? The meanest creature hath that happines. The warbling quiristers of the woods do hopp From sprey to sprey, in their owne natiue freedome, Hauing no sence of such a seruitudeâ But miserable I am more restrain'd. Emil. Sister, I loue you well, tak't not vnkindly That thus you are reclus't; it shall not last long; Beleeue it, gentle Cloris! and the cause That thus restraines thee, is to make mee happie. For, by obscuring those faire eyes, I liue The glorie of the time, and will not you Beare something for a sister? If thy beautie Sho'd get abroad, how meane should I appeare? For from those shadowes that do come from thee I borrow all my lusture. Clo. Gentle sister, If that this face, which you call beautifull, Offend yee, make it worse; I will indure it: I will vse art to keepe theise wanton locks From curling thus, theise cheeks shall grow more pale, Or I will chace the liuely blood away With silent sighs, or wash 'em with my teares, To make 'em white, as is myne innocence. Enter Lavia. Emil. Come, come, be patient; you must beare awhile. Lav. Madam, your seruant and his brother with him, Young Milecert, whome Fame reports the heyre. Emil. They come as wish't for, Cloris away; be silent; I am all furie elce. Exit Cloris. Enter Aramant and Millecert. Ara. My dearest mistris! If there be happines on earth, as wee May count that soe which is the cheifest good, Then giue your humblest seruant leaue to say It liues in you. Emil. You flatter, Aramant. If there be any thing you prize in mee, It hath cheife growth and prime adition From the true worthynes I find in you. Ara. No more, my faire Emilia, why should wee Keepe such a distance? This smooth languague best Suites vnresolued soules; wee need no words But such as haue a power to crowne our wishes; Our hearts haue found this vnion. Heer's my brother, My onely brother, know him, hee's a kind oneâ What saist thou, Milecert, is shee not faire? Would not this purchace tempt aduentrous youth To ship their fortunes in the angry sea Of parent's rage, to find out such a mine, Where all the treasure of the world's inclos'd? The rich Peru is but a sunny banck Compar'd to herâ And the proud East hath not so many pearles As shee hath beauties. Mille. 'Tis a goodly creature. Ara. Her touch is an elixar, which wo'd moue Halfe marble men, and raise the spirits of age To youth and vigour. Shee's a sea of nectar To which the LethÃ¦ of my cares do run, And loose themselves for euer; Set your land (Which was my birth-right) by her, and I'd part wo'tt, Oft'ner then I haue thoughts, e're part with this. Me thinks I'me all compos'd of ayre, a lightnes Shootes through my veines, when I behold her eyes. Lauia, how did thy lady rest to night? He talkes to Lavia. Mille. My brother is transported, and indeed I do not blame him, lady; such a beautie Cannot but worke effects of admiration. Emil. Your goodnes adds vnto my meane deserts Too large a title. But, pray tell me, sir, Hath your dead father setled all th'estate On you, (as it is nois'd,) and left my seruant To seeke new fortunes. Mille. Yes; upon his death-bed Hee put to's choice, whether he would enioy His land, or you; for both hee should not haue: My brother's answere was but short, he valewd Your loue aboue all earthly happines, And quickly quitt his interrest in the land. Emil. It showes your brother was of meane desert: It better suites with you, for greatest fortunes Attend the noblest minds; it falls upon 'em Like a distilling dew on a rich soyle To make it swell with fattnes; but a curse Followes vnworthines, like noysome blasts, That makes all barren. I shall neuer thinke That hee had vertue now. Ara. But prithee tell mee To Lauia. Do's shee not dreame of mee? I'me sure shee do's: For the toyld spirits, ministers of day, Doe spend their wandring phansies in the night On the same subiect; and shee hath not blusht To check the howers for too officious speed, When with our kisses wee did mingle soules. The sun had not more freedome with the day, Then shee and I haue had, but if his hast To meet his amourous loue had hinder'd ours, Her frownes wo'd make it night; and in such darkenes Shee cannot choose but dreame. Lav. My lord, of late Shee hath beene farr from any such distemper. Mille. The beaten mariner, after long toyle, To Emilia. Wo'd not reioyce to be at home in safetie, As I sho'd ioy in you, wer't not disloyall, And most iniurious to my worthie brother. Emil. I cannot thinke he doth deserue that title: Your father knew some foule play, otherwise How co'd hee bee so cruell? wo'd a tiger Expose her young ones to the rage of want, And not prouide for 'em? Is there a creature, Whome nature hath not taught an aptitude To cherish and preserue her owne? Beleeue it, You wrong your buried father thus to doubt The justice of his act, being his last: And, if his act were iust, then haue you cause To doubt him for your brother. Mille. O the power Of loue and beautie! how hast thou bewitcht mee? I must be any thing that you will make mee. Emil. Why now I find thee worthy of my fauor, And thy great fortune; wee will stand the brunt Of this man's furie, though it speake in thunder; And when the danger's past, then reape th'effects Of our great victorie. Mille. Lett this confirme it. Ara. Thou art thy mistris' cabinet, and wilt Discouer nothing. Now, my louing brother, How do you like my faire Emilia? Mille. Why well. So well, I thinke I neuer shall Like any better. Aside. Ara. 'Tis a heauenly feature, But yett this outside is a wildernes Vnto the pleasant paradize within. Emil. Fie, fie! it is too much; you'l spoile the bargaine With praising the comoditie; it needs notâ The match is made alreadie. Ara. 'Tis so, sweet one, And made so firme, that time may weare 'em out, But neuer breake the bonds. Emil. That time's at hand. Ara. It hath alreadie bene too slowe, but wee Will pay it a full interest; Hymen's torch Shall now begin to flame. Emil. You are deceyu'd, sir. Ara. I hope, I am not; yett I read a storie Upon thy brow, which makes mee hope againe I am deceyu'd, for thou canst not be angrie. Emil. No more then Southerne ayre chaft into heat By the sunn's scorching beames. Can I loue barrenes? Weake, sordid man! All creatures naturally Suck vp their preseruacion: if they want it, They pine and die; can I subsist with nothing? Ara. How's this? Emil. Nay neuer wonder, for 'tis true. Ara. It cannot bee, for thou art full of goodnes, And such black guiltie thoughts can ne're abide Where Vertue dwells, therefore they flie thus from thee; When they are all past, thy pure naturall sweetnes Will show it selfe agen, and that firme loue Wee planted once with interchanged vowes, And waterd with our teares to make 'em growe, Will spring againe and florish. Emil. Noe, 'tis wither'd; For it doth want the sap that should preserue it; And by how much my loue exceeded measure, When it did fix on thee, the same extreame Augments my hate; the propertie is alter'd! 'Tis true I loued thee firmely, when thou wert Heire to that fortune, which thou now hast lost; But when the substance is once gon, think'st thou That I can loue the shadowe? Ara. Doe I dreame? This is some furie sure, not my Emilia. Thou seem'st to mee some foule malignant vapor Rais'd from the sinke of syn, swolne with a venombe Transcending woman's pride, which breaking on Poore credulous man did blast his growing hopes, And make him thinke there is no other hell, But what is in thy breast. Emil. Lett's leave this wonder. Ara. No, stay and heare me gently; doe not wrong mee; I cannot think thee wicked. Hath great Nature Desolu'd the sweet and pleasant harmonie That chaines the world together? are the spangles That do imbellish heauen's rich canopie Dropt from their spheres? hath the sun left the vigor To animate and cherish with its warmth? If not, if theise hold due proportion still, Then why is this disorder? You did loue mee, And can you now hate, what you once lou'd dearely? Emil. I doe not hate thy person, but thy follie. For can I thinke there can be any worth, Or vertue in the man, that thus hath pul'd His father's curse upon him? all the good I found in thee, I lov'd; and now that's gone, I'le leaue thee to thy follie, Aramant; A line drawne out at length, with parting ends, Shall sooner meet then wee. Ara. Teach me to rage Some earthen power, for I must onely spend My selfe in anger now; it is a woman, A wretched woman, wrongs mee. What reuenge Is left for mee? how shall I beare my selfe? In this great storme I shal be lost for euer. But I will argue calmelyâWhy doe you Afflict me thus? this triall cutts too deepe; Recall thy sence agen, and thinke how sleightly I gaue away my selfe to purchase thee; Lett mee not loose all; I will not repent yett If thou wilt be but kind. O looke upon mee, Looke vpon all my fortunes, and if then Thou find'st no pittie, make this spectacle The miserablest obiect, that thine eyes Can fix vpon. Emil. You might ha' learn'd more witt, And kept your land. Ara. Tempt mee no further, fury! Reason, thou queene of frailty, where is vertue? Are all your seruants paid with such rewards, As theise I haue? Then who'le hereafter keepe A faith or vowe? Who will not tell the world That to bee good and vertuous is a crime? And soe invert the precept, that the lawe Or nature teaches, till man apprehends, That goodnes onely deserues punishment, And vice a recompence. And if this holds, Who will respect an oath, a freind, a teare, But for a snare or trap? or value woman, Till his hott lust giues him an appetite To add to his black legend? Mille. I am cruell to suffer this. Thou art a tirant, Loue. Ara. What shall I doe? Emil. The best way's to be patient. Ara. 'Tis the foole's burthen, I will cast it off And putt on all my rage; it is more easie In this extremitie to grapple with. Yett what is man, that euerie litle puff, Crossing his humor, should produce a tempest To shipwrack all his reason? I'le be quiet In spight of woman's folly. Emil. 'Tis well done: Your brother and I will see you shall not want. Ara. My brother and you! Why, pray yee, do you couple? Emil. Wee may do shortly. Ara. Some good angel tell me, Hath vertue quite forsooke the earth? Is there An vniuersall ruine of goodnes? Resolue mee of this ridle. Millecert, Thy standing mute proclaimes thee guiltie. Mille. Oh! What shall I doe? To which path shall I bend? Nature commands me not to wrong my brother, And besids that great tye, his innocence Drawes pittie for his double iniurie; But, like a violent torrent, loue breakes forth And beares downe all before it. Her faire eyes Armes mee against all oppositions. Brother, 'tis true I loue her, and shee hath Assur'd the like to mee. I must not start back. Ara. My brother, th'art a villaine; therefore drawe, That I may leaue no memorie to man Of such a wretch. Emil. Help, help! my lord Pantarbo! Enter Pantarbo, Servius, and Tonsus. Pant. Servius, Tonsus, part 'em. Ara. Well, I shall find you out, to loose the rest, That once had quiet being in my brest. Exit. Emil. Come, you must shun his anger; hee is violent: And when this storme is past, a glorious sun-shine Will follow after. Mille. Loue, thou art a fire That consumes all things, but thyne owne desire. Exit. Pant. Ladies, how come this fray? Emil. Please you withdraw, I shall informe you how. Pant. With all our harts. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS SECUNDUS. Scena Prima. Antonio and Trebutio. Treb. But is Emilia and young Millecert Coupled so soone? Anto. They marryed in an instant. Shee had no sooner cast of Aramant, But greedily shee did persue his brother And marryed him; making the willow wreath That crown'd the one a bridall for the other. Treb. Did not I tell you, what a changing humor Possest the sex? Anto. O that I had some venome, Some oyle of woman in mee, that I might Slip into rage. Is there a soule among 'em, But what is sensitiue? Who shall we trust to, When the great help of man thus failes? O woman, Inconstant woman! hath the gaudie stamp Of faire made such impression, that good Must be incompitable? Subtile traitor, Whose treason reaches to the hart, O shall, Shall wee be lost in thee, in whome wee had Our being first? Sure thy depraued nature Hath wrought vs to this height of wickednes; It is not from ourselues. Treb. How dos hee beare it? Anto. As one would beare a limb rent from his body By cruell hands: and when his noble mind Considers who his sword must make a way through To his reuenge, it is to mee a wonder, His great heart breaks not. Enter Busiro, Pantarbo, Servius, and Tonsus. Treb. Here's the lord Busiro, The duke's great officer. Anto. Then ther's a breast That harbors more then innocence. Treb. Hee is The great workemaster of the state, his braine Moues all the ingins in't, and 'tis a crime For any man to thinke hee is not honest. Anto. And if he bee soe hee's belyed. How many That did oppose his ends haue mett with their's, Through darke contriuances? Nay, Innocence Herselfe, Bellaura, a child, the onely heire To this great dukedome, posted hence toe soone; And by his meanes, or elce hee is abus'd. Treb. Why is't not question'd? Anto. 'Thas bene, and the duke Will not beleeue it. Treb. But his sonne Pantarbo I hope's no pollitician. Anto. 'Las, good man, Hee has a studied speech or two to vtter, And hants vs euery where till they are vented. Busi. You are growne the may-game of the court, the boyes Pick vp your rags of speeches for their sport, And vent your serious folly. Leaue it, orâ Exit. Pant. I will ha' my humor, hee has his, old dotardâ And luckily heere is occacon offred. Anto. Now wee must stand the brunt; you know the answere. Treb. See, hee begins his charge. A prittie posture! Pant. I'me glad 'tis in my power to tell theise gentlemen, The court is honor'd by them, not that I Deserue that hapinesse, or the most worthie, But because Fortune now hath cast it on mee In this most blest incounter. Both. Hum! your lordshipâ Pant. And 'tis a happie one, for it doth bring Good omens with it: for, as mariners Joy in the sight of those admir'd twins Castor and Pollux, in their brightest glorie, And feare no danger, soe like those two starrs Your presence ioyes the court, for 'tis a sea, A rugged sea without you. Both. Hum! your lordshipâ Pant. A halcion calmenes now shall crowne the browes Of the seuerest great ones, and the plotts And practizes, that do disturbe their braines, Shal be converted into proiects, how To giue you entertainement. Both. Hum! your lordshipâ Pant. The ladies too will, like the mary-golds Disclose themselues, and put on all their riches; They'le search the deepes, and rob the Neirides Of pearle to decke their breasts; their fairer haire Shall not addorne the shrine of Venus more, But your faire armes, and all their beauties bee At your (but wisht) comandment. Both. Hum! your lordship, At the next meeting wee will answere yee; Wee haue now busines that doth more concerne vs. Exeunt. Pant. What an absurd and sleight digression's this! Are theise the witts? Serv. Your onely pollicie Is to bee silent now. Pant. Why I haue studied Theise speeches at the expence of many weekes. Tons. Your lordship is much disappointed truely. Pant. Disioynted, out of frame, put of the hookes; My father's dreames did neuer vex mee soe. Serv. What dreames, sweet Morpheus? Pant. Visions in his sleepe, That frights vs all; hee sayes a spirit hants him. Tons. It is a guiltie conscience, that persues him, Which euer wakes. Pant. And then to comfort him, (Nay I'le tell all, because hee angers mee,) After such fearefull apparitions Hee triggs it to Romilia'sâ Serv. Ther's a wench Cockers him up with brothes of sparrowe's rumps, Marrow of hee-goates, and the chines of weasellsâ Wee know what you wo'd say. Tons. Shee keepes a bawdy house. Pant. Indeed ther's delicate wenches. Serv. Peace; not a word more. Heere comes your father and lord Aramant. Tons. Alas! good gentleman, hee's much abus'd. Enter Aramant and Busiro. Ara. My lord, my case is cleare, it beares an action In court of conscience, and I cannot digg The earth for hidden treasure, to make way Vnto the justice of my cause. 'Tis true Great officers doe pay well for their places, Therefore they must bee brib'd. I know your lordship (Though you be lecherous and haue your whores Drest in more various shapes then Aretine Could e're expresse,) yett y'are not such a villaine, In the whole progresse of your pollicie To murther aboue twentie. Busi. Hee's distracted. Ara. And yett sleepe soundly toe, and neuer fetch A sigh or grone for't! D'ye heare, my lord, Was not judge Minos a coukold? ther's a bull, Women are no such creatures! D'ye thinke I am soe madd to venture into hell, As Orpheus did, to fetch a woman back? Noeâlett 'em stay there. Pant. This is very prittie. Ara. Ha, ha, he! How the thing prances, And sneres in's trappings. If I see an eliphant With a castle on's back cutt out in clothes, Shall I call it a man? Where lyes his witt then? Belike 'twas mar'd y'the making, and soe lyes Upon the taylor's hand. Prittie Prometheans, Can they make men wise, vertuous, noble? Yesâ The world's meere out-side, if a man ha' money Hee may bee any thing. You thinke I'me madd now? Busi. Indeed I thinke thou art. Ara. Who is not soe? You grandies a'the court cannot take breath, Nor breath in sweet ayre, besids putrid lungs, For multitudes of suitors, that, like gnatts, Doe buzz about your eares, and make yee madd. And are not they soe that doe follow yee? Yesâand you minor courtiers, that do flant it And spend the maine stock out in expectation, Are you not madd? Why here is my young lord (Besides the anticke motions that do much Perplexe his braine) bring him but to a wench And hee's starke madd on't. Will not a good fee Make lawyers baule as they were madd? And are not They worse that hire 'em to't? An intemperate seazon, Doth it not make the countrie people murmur As they were madd? And then your cittisonsâ They are horne-madd. So we are all madd. Ha, ha, he! Pant. Heere's a mad world indeed. Ara. All's in disorder. But who dares now reforme what is amisse? For tell a magistrate he turnes the edge Of lawe on whome hee please; or a great lord, That his good honest father sold no land To purchace honor with; or aske my ladie Why shee doth stripp her selfe so like a mermaid; 'Tis not her litle dog's fault. Touch a serpent And it will sting yee: I, 'tis dangerous. My lord, d'yee heare the newes? Busi. What? Ara. The great Turke Is now confin'd vnto fiue hundred whores. Is't not a fine life? And a'must not murther More brothersâthen a'has. 'Tis an ill way To secure greatnesâI'le not murther mine. Busi. How his words grate my soule, and strike a horror Through all my blood! A guiltie conscience Is an vnquiet guest; what hee hath said Doth trouble mee; though it may passe for madnes, It is not soe. I'le haue his mouth stop't. Exit. Ara. Goeâ Goe my young crinkler 'y the hams, goe, follow, Follow thy dad, great Pluto goes to councell, And Procerpine and hee'le meet soone. You may Haue a speech readie to popp of in triumph. Pant. I am putt downe, I know not what to say. I wo'd I co'd speake Welch, that's a madd language. Serv. Hee's strangely alter'd. Exeunt. Ara. Nay, goe you along too; Follow the sent: the puppie wants his couples. Enter Antonio. Anto. How doe you, worthie sir? Ara. Why, very well. Anto. My lord Busiro do's complaine, you are Toe liberall of your tougne. Though he deserues More ill then you can speake, yet 'tis not good To vtter all you knowe. Ara. What did I say? Did I talke wildly? I doe feele I am not As I was wont to bee, and yett I hope It will not reach to madnes. O fraile man! Why should thy proud aspiring thoughts seeke out (Through thy soule's saftie) superioritie Ouer thy equalls, when thou cans't not master Thine owne weake passions? Anto. Now your soule flies high; Keepe that pitch still, and be aboue theise mischeifes. Ara. What shall I doe? My brother is not dead yett; I'de rather hee should die another way, Then by my hand. Anto. Hee's dead, sir, to all goodnes. Ara. O bring mee to some place, where I may neuer See him againe. Anto. And peace of mind dwell with thee. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na II. Enter Cloris and Lauia. Clo. Lauia, good wench, how am I bound to thee For thy assistance! Lav. Truly, I do pittie your youth and inocence, to see you cloister'd And shutt vp from the world; my lady is Toe cruell to you. Clo. Soe shee is indeed, Since my deserts hath not pul'd on the rigor Of her feirce anger. Lav. It is faut enough, That you are hansomer, and shee do's know it; And knowes how it wo'd derogate from her, If you had freedome to bee seene. Clo. Alas! My iniuries are poore when I but thinke Vpon the noble, iniur'd Aramant: His wrongs and sufferings shall out weare storie, And lay a brand vpon our sex for euer. No tougne shall speake of woman but with scorne; Their teares shall sooner make hard marble melt, Then bring the harts of men to find beleife, That there is truth in woman. Lav. You deliuer Your words with such an earnestnes, they speake Loue in your lookes. Clo. I must confesse I loue him, And do not blush to say, his miseries Begott this loue in mee. Lav. Then you loue, madame, The most accomplish'd gentleman in Burgundy. Clo. Thou oft hast told mee soe. I neuer saw him But passing by my windowe, nor could that Make this impression in mee, if his wrongs Had not begott my pittie, and soft Pittie Is Loue's first parent. Lav. But what hope haue you In one that is distracted? Clo. 'Tis not much; His passions are not violent; I wish This freedome onely to recouer him. I haue a balme whose vertue is so pretious, That in a moment it charmes all the thoughts, And giues the spirits restâHow I gott this Requires a storieâThis I will applye, And hope to giue him ease, for I thinke truly Those powers that first inspir'd my mind to loue Haue pointed out a way for mee to raise The man my sister ruin'd. Emil. (calls within) Lauia! Lav. Madameâ Wee have mispent our time in talking, goeâ My lady comesâThe garden gate is openâ Awayâaway! Exit Cloris. Enter Emilia. Emil. What, Lauia! Lav. Madame. Emil. Where art, wench? How do's my pritty sister, is shee well? Lav. Farr better now then shee hath bene of late. Shee's out a'your reach. Aside. Emil. 'Tis wellâGoe inâ If your lord aske for mee, direct him hether. Exit Lavia. I do not like his humor; he setts puling, âWhat will the world thinke? How vnnaturall Shall I be counted?â Hee's an naturall, An asse, that doth prescribe the rule of 's actions By the vulgar voice. They'le say, I am inconstant: 'Tis trueâhave I not reason? Will they blame mee For being prouident? The vsurer In his extreame extortion, is commended Aboue the prodigall. What marchant is Soe foolish to sell all his wealth away Vnto a bankrupt, if hee be a knowne one? Enter Antonio. (behind.) I am so farr from thinking it a fault, That if I were not tyed, this peeuish humor Wo'd make mee change agen. Anto. It showes you woman. Emil. How now! Which way came you? vnmaner'd fellow, To thrust vpon my priuacies! Anto. Your ladyship Will indure more sometimes, and not be angrie. For once I made your garden gate my way. Emil. Lauia! within there! Anto. Noeâyou shall not sturr Till I haue read my lecture: I am come To ease my heart vpon you, which is readie To breake for want of vent. You are a woman The falcest, periurd'st, and the most inhumane That euer added staine vnto the sex. They all will blush for thee, and curse thy memorie: For when posteritie shall tell the world Thy crueltie, our youth, like phenixes, From their owne ashes will produce a people, And lett the virgins pine away in silence. O thou hast wrong'd a man that hath more worthâ Emil. Then thou hast witt. D'ye come to raile at mee Y'my owne house? Anto. Yes, I ha' tied my hands vp, And meane to strike thee with my tougne; that is A weapon that can cheifely peirce the soule; If thou hast any, 'tis as light as vanitie. I am acquainted with your constitutions; A taylor gotten y'the change of the moone Is not soe fickle. What are all your dressings, Your prunings, paintings, and bare necks, but emblems Of a more loose mind? all your actions Onely to make an noise, like children's ratles For fooles to gaze at, withâThere goes my lady! Emil. This fellow's madd. Anto. A goodly peece of puff pac't, A litle lantified to hold the gilding; Then, if your usher dwindells in his leggs, Your freind must meet you at a ladie's chamber, Or at a doctor of phisicks, who sometimes May cast his figure on your ephemerides, And hee will tell you who shal be the father A'your first child: doctors are cunning fellowes, And can giue drinks to procure loue; you ladies Deale with such symples. If my young lord sees yee, Hee takes you vp, and hurries you to Bedlam As hee were madd. From thence toâ Emil. Foule mouth'd fellow! I'le not indure this grosse abuse. What, Lauia! Anto. No, no, no! This gallerie is farr from any call. And then your women must be brib'd, they can Discouer much elce, for if you should long Vpon your breeding for a peece of flesh, They are your onely ingeniers, and if They gett a bitt by the way themselues, and take A surfett on't, it must bee wisely carryed. O, ther's a pollitique comonwealth within yee! Emil. This is such impudence! Anto. I haue not done yett. A face is a faire baite, and a good legg In a fine pleated stocking takes, prouided You ieare your husbands, and protest to marry Onely for land; and sweare t'haue stincking breathes. No matterâyou'le haue children, which hee shall Thinke are his owne, and the good man must buy More druggs to sett you vp againe, then wo'd Furnish an hospitall: a ruin'd abby Askes not so much repaire; for you must haue Your teeth, like virginall iacks, pop in and out, As you are ta'ne a peeces, and the haire You lost y'the last incounter, furnished The next asizes. Y'are indeed all sinne, All shame, all womanâand till Aramant Recouers his sad sicknes, I shall curse yee. A litle more, and I ha' doneâYour sister, Your innocent sisterâthat small sentence speakes Your pride and enuie; if the deuill bee Your equall at all theise, I will turne Capuchin. Soe farwell, Composition. Exit. Emil. What ill starr Procured mee this mischeife, that this slaue Must baite mee heere to death, and I not haue A meanes to bee reuenged? What, Lauia! Enter Lavia. O are yee come? Who lett this villaine in? How comes the garden gate vnlockt? Lav. Is't open? Emil. Is't open! fury! so shall mine bee too. Run to my sister's chamber quickly, see If shee be there. The warring winds that meet Exit Lavia. And iustle vp the billowes till they rage, Are calme to what I haue within mee. How now? Reenter Lavia. Lav. Madame, she's gon. Emil. Gon! 'Twas a plot betwixt yee. I am betraidâAll my iust anger arme mee. Exeunt. Scena III. Enter Antonio and Trebutio. Anto. I haue bene with my changable taffetie madame, And read her such a lesson, that I hope Shee'le cast vp her accounts andâhang herselfe. Treb. But did you see hope of amendment in her? Did her eyes drowne themselues in teares? Anto. Yee may As well draine corke as gett a teare from her: Shee has her humors toe, but not soe watrish: Her cesternes stand the other way. It is The hardest harted peece of woman's flesh That e're I sawe; sure 'tis some carman's bastard Begotten at a great stop. Ther's more tendernes To be expected from an executioner Than her: her eyes, that should haue run in floods, Were arm'd with arrowes of disdaine and anger. O, 'tis a fury! If Don Belzebub Wo'd haue a lep, this were a beast to breed on. Treb. Thou sett'st her out well yett. Anto. But how dos Aramant? Treb. Hee hath shrowd fitts still, and doth want but sleepe To giue him ease, which his vnquiet mind Will not admitt. Hee's got abroad againe Into the woods. Anto. And is the duke a'hunting? Treb. Hee is, and sent for vs an hower since To waite vpon him, but I could not find yee. Anto. Lett's away then; wee may find Aramant there. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na IV. Enter Aramant. Ara. Here's no falce brothers, sure, nor no falce women; Theise woods breed noe such monstersâI'le dwell heereâ The harmeles beasts are my companions. Now I may sleepe secure, but that I feele An vnkind noise that whispers to mee, Aramant, Thou art vndone for euer. Where art, spirit? I do coniure thee post away theise shapes That hurry in my braines. Where shall I rest? I shall find none here. Who's this come to vex mee? More monsters yett! Enter Cloris. Clo. Alas! hee raues. Ara. What art thou? Art thou a daughter of thinne ayre or earth? A child of night or day? Clo. I am a woman. Ara. Then none of theise, and yett compos'd of all, A faire and firme, darke-minded vanitie. But you do seeme to weepe! O, you haue teares, Sad killing teares; weepe on I pray:âand vowes, Haue you no blasting ones? Keepe ofâWhat power Makes vs affect that most, that is most hurtfull? I will not looke vpon yeeâI haue reason nowâ Where abouts lyes thy soule? Clo. In euery part. Ara. No, there is none in thy face: that's not deform'd: But draw that painted curtaine, wee shall find A horrid figure vnder it, would fright Man in his best of reason. But I like theeâ Speake truly what thou art. Clo. I am a spirit, The genius of that loue once dwelling in thee; Which had a noble habitation, Till vnkind vsage forc't it from thy brest, And then I went with it, to bring it back againeâ And I haue brought it for thee. Ara. O, where is it? Clo. Wrapt vp within my hart. Ara. How shall I come by 't? Clo. I will infuse it by some happie charme, If you will leaue your rage. Ara. I pri'the doe then. Clo. But come not nere mee 'till I do present it, Least it takes wing againe, for spirits are ayrie, Not to bee toucht: this loue I bring is such Vntill it bee applyed. Ara. Come, show thy skill, Thou prittie spirit, for wee must giue way Vnto those powers that dispose of vs. He setts downe, she rubs his temples. [Clo.] SONG. If the power of art can drawe Nature from her first election, To a more refined lawe By extracting her perfection; Let it now breath it's perfume, And with slumber strike the braine; Now your greatest strength assume, Run through euerie nerue and vaine. Lett a silent wonder ceaze All his thoughts, that hee may find, There is artificiall ease For the troubles of the mind: And if thou dost sett him free, Nature then will yeild to thee. Clo. Hee sleepes! A blessed silence crowne his ey-lids, And shut vp all his rage! But where am I? Am I not lost in finding him? O Loue, How thou dost arme thy seruants! Wild beasts now Cannot affright mee, nor my sister's anger, Which is as terrible; I followed him As eagerly as hunters doe their chace, Or as the ayre persues an emptie place; And yett I feale no vnchast thought within mee. Bee witnes, you high powers, whose justice gards The innocent; and as my spotles, free And artlesse hart speakes truth, so prosper mee. Enter The Duke. Duke. I haue lost all my people, and the sportâ But here's faire game indeed, a prittie wench! Where dwel'st thou, faire one? Clo. At Besancon, sir. Duke. Thy name? Clo. Cloris. Duke. I'me sure thy birth is noble, Thy countenance doth speake it. Wilt thou goe With mee vnto the cittie? Clo. I haue, sir, A brother heere, sick, that requires assistance, And do intreat your pardon. Duke. I haue companie Coming behind, will lend their care to him. Pri'the go thou with mee, for I do find Something in thy faire lookes, that bids mee loue thee. Clo. Sir, I beseech you robb mee not of all My ioyes at once; I do but now begin To find my happines. Duke. Come, y'are to blame, And know not how to court the fortune followes yee. A prince's eye commands, much more his tougne. Clo. As y'are my prince I kneele to you, and offer Kneels. Theise harmeles teares to be a ransome for mee. Wo'd I were shutt vp in my cell againe, That men may bee to mee obiects of wonder, Since my first freedome fares so ill. Duke. Art thou Emilia's sister? Clo. Yes, sir. Duke. Pri'the rise, And I'le be bolder with thee, for I heare Thou hast a vertue farr aboue thy sexe, And I will neuer leaue it thus. Clo. But, sirâ Duke. No moreâ Clo. I dare not call for feare of waking him. Exeunt. Enter Antonio, Trebutio, Pantarbo, Seruius, and Tonsus. Anto. A fellow told mee that the Duke went this way; The stagg is downe long since. Treb. But his good lordship Fell but iust now. Anto. The tamer beast, I trowe. Pant. Ouer and ouer, Kethay. Jade! H'as almost Broken my crupper; alas, I am A very grissellâ Anto. To a beast of burthen: You haue no brasen ribbs, nor huckle bones Fitt to sett vp for monuments of giants. Pant. No, noe, I feele I haue not. Anto. You haue speches thoe Are charmes for stumbling; co'd not you vse one of 'em? Th'are ex'lent receitesâas thus: Sweet rone, Deare beast, looke to thy feet, some mole-hill may Or traiterous stump in ambuscado lay, And flowndring holes do flownce. I vow by Stix 'Tis hard to know which hath most coltish tricks: And to giue each his due, as it is fitt, The beast's head's greater, but the man's least witt. Pant. Come, Seruius, lett's away, they begin horse-play. Anto. Hee's gon. Gramarcy, horse! Pant. Tonsus, away. Exeunt Pantarbo, Servius, and Tonsus. Anto. How hee do's muster vp his rancks! I wonder Theise fellowes smell him not. Treb. 'Tis their dependance:â But you'le be iearing, and hee'le tell his father. Anto. Hang the old rotten stump (in barke of veluet) With the greene withe his sonne. Shall I stand mewing After such hee-catts, and make leggs, and thanke 'em For being pollitique and humerous fooles? I'le bee a porter first, and breake my back With a great burthen at a ballad singer's. Treb. Who's that lies sleeping there? Anto. Wonder of man! 'Tis AramantâI hope hee is not dead. Treb. No, no, he breathes. Stillnes possesse his veines, And charme downe all his passions! Anto. Lett him rest. Treb. Hee sturrs: lett's speake to him. Anto. Stay a litle. Ara. Where am I? How came I in theise woods? what dreame is this? You are my freinds Antonio, and Trebutio; Is it not soe? Both. Wee are. Ara. And was there no body elce heere? Anto. Who d'ye seeke soe? Ara. I haue incounter'd the most pleasing fancie. Anto. For loue's sake, what? Ara. Sawe you no woman heere? Treb. Hee raues still. Anto. Noe; for if there had bene one, The Duke has such a pack of lime-hounds with him, Shee could not scape their catch. Ara. 'Tis very strange! Why then it was an angell. Anto. A woman and an angell! this is madnes. Treb. It seemes it is some light one then. Ara. She spake to mee With such a charming voice, till heauy sleepe Did lay his leaden wings vpon myne eyes, And then shee vanisht; yett methinks I see her In my mind's eye. Anto. Bee blind to theise distempers; They are but darke perturbers of the braine. Ara. Nay, this is true; I saw her, my hart sees her; And if my eyes be euer blest againe With that faire obiect, you shall see her toe To bring your wonder to beleife. Anto. It must bee In fairy land then; where if e're I come To ride with Oberon in cockle shells Drawne by two pish-mares, let some courtier beg mee. Treb. Lett's gett him home. Anto. Come, will you goe with vs? Ara. Yes, I will goe, in hope to find this faire one; For I haue now quite lost my old desire, And in that losse haue found a fresher fire. Exeunt.</field>

Are all things readie? Lav. Yes. Emil. Where's your lord? Lav. There, madam. Enter Millecert. Emil. Come, you are allwayes y'your dumps; be merry, man, And see how I can force a mirth: for can it Be naturall to see my younger sister, (And onely in opinion toe, not blood,) Triumphing in her pride, by the duke's fauor, And I must crouch to her, as to an idoll? O my diuining soule, that prompted mee To fixe her glorie in obscuritie! Wo'd she had neuer seene the light! But I Will put on calmenes, smooth as innocence, Till anger finds a way vnto my wishes. Mille. And will you vent it, when she sues for peace, That hath receyued the iniurie? Emil. True, she sends for mee, And with faire promises couers her wrongs: But shall I trust her? Wo'd you trust your brother, If hee should seeke a reconcilement? Mille. Oh, you raise a storme within my breast, that cannot Bee laid without a shower of teares; I wo'd Repaire the breatch I ha' made with any hazard. Emil. Then th'art a thinne brain'd fellow, and I'le vse yee soe: A flegmetique souleâNow I am going to court, I must not be rain'd vp by a tame musler, That shall confine my freedome to his winks. A roming eye is a court comet, and Showes the prodigious fall of some great man. Husbands, like rough drawne shadowes, nere at hand Looke course and scurvelie, but at a distance They sett a hansome peice of prittie well. In time you'le know what's fitt. Mille. My brother's iniuries Fall thick vpon mee now. Yee guids of reason, Why do you giue mee patience to indure this? Emil. Nay, you must beare more yet, therefore 'tis best To practize now. Enter Pantarbo. Pant. My honor'd lady, welcome! I must redouble it, for the duke's mistris Kisses her. Your faire and vertuous sister, with a sweetnes Equall vnto her beautie, doth command it. Emil. Shee is all goodnes. Pant. But your faire indowments (Were there no other motiue) will attract The powersâvmâshakes on 't! see now if I can hitt on 'tâ The powersâand faculties of humane reason, Aside. To such an apprehension of your worth That all the world will striue to doe you seruice For y'are a peece of s? The whole of all felicit? Emil. My lord, I find such high perfections flowing ? That I must stop the currant of yo? And pay some tribute back againe, for ? She kisses Pantarbo. I haue receyued. This cannot choose but vex? Pant. You rauish mee with sweetnes, dearest lady. Mille. I shall grow desperate, rackt with iniuries, And breake into reuenge. I now begin To see my shame and loth it: 'tis belowe My spirit to grapple with weake words or woman, But I will gaine a conquest on my selfe. Exit. Pant. The man is iealous sure? Emil. Hee is, my lord. Pant. Wo'd he were here agen, that I might kill him With kissing thee. Reenter Millecert. Mille. Why heere hee is agenâ Thou ragg of vanitie, patcht into greatnes, What dar'st thou doe? Drawes. Pant. O hold! I was in ieast, sir. Mille. Take that in earnest then; thou hast a soule Toe cheape for my revenge. He hurts him. Emil. Help! murder! help! Exeunt Millecert and Emilia. Enter Antonio and Trebutio. Pant. O heere he comes agen! Peepes vp. Anto. What noise was that? Treb. It was Emilia that past by. Anto. Shee raises Tempests where e're shee goes. Wo'd I were safe I'my owne witts againe at home; the court Will ?hen such black porpisces ?t-man ? growne a fauorite. Sure 'tis shee ?amant so raues on, for the duke ?nd her 'a hunting. There hee tooke her vp And 'tis not the first wench his goodly beagles Haue hunted after: Busiro's old dog at it. Braines of a brick-bat! looke where a lord lies! Treb. Sleeping. This shred is cutt y'the whole peece. Hee's hurtâ Anto. And feares a second slash. Wee'le ha' some sport. Behold the fall of a great man, whome time And enuie of his good parts hath brought lowe. Treb. 'Tis strange! among his owne, so nere the court Where he was honor'd. Anto. Truly 'tis great pittie; Wee'le see him nobly buried. Are yee peeping? He lifts vp his head. Pant. O, I am kil'd! Anto. With what, a ladie's lipp? Pant. The villaine Millecert has run mee through Because I kist his wife. Anto. You must be licking, And liquorish flies do sometimes meet with flaps. Treb. Gett vpâgett vp. Pant. I cannot stand. Treb. I warrant yee. Pant. O for a surgion quickly, I shall sound elce. Treb. If you be sound you neede no surgion. Anto. Come, Weele lead him to Romilia's, and cage him Among the vncleane birds, his father feeds there. Treb. The whores will pinch him to the quick. Anto. No matterâ His lordship's strong broths must haue vent; you see Hee is too rampant. Will your lordship walke now, And leaue your cringes and long leggs? Pant. O gentlemenâ I doe beseech you help mee. Anto. The good man Is mortified. I'le take his wound for two pence. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Cloris and Emilia. Clo. Sister, I haue no time to speake your welcome, The duke is coming in. Emil. O noble madame, I find a sad repentance for the ills I did inflict vpon you, and your goodnes In this your pardon, moues a thankefulnes, Would melt mee into teares; mine actions shall Hereafter in the humblest straine of gratitude Expresse a sorrow, though I neuer can Deserue forgiuenes. Clo. Vrge no moreâWe'are friends. Emil. I hope this is well acted; if it bee not I could draw flouds of teares out, rather then Betray mine enuie to her. Aside. Clo. See, the duke. Enter The Duke, Busiro, Antonio, Trebutio, Seruius, Tonsus, and Attendants. Duke. My prittie Cloris, thou art all the ioy The world hath left mee, and reviu'st a loue That hath bene buryed long. Who's that? Clo. My sister. Duke. Shee is most welcome for thy sake. Emil. What curse Gouern'd my birth, that I deserue no better? Duke. Thou hast bene absent long: when I am frome thee I wander from the course of all my comfort. Here lett mee fixe, for should my roving fancie Incounter all the obiects that great Nature Hath framed beautifull, they would appeare But drosse compar'd to this. Me-thinks shee looks Like a cÃ¦lestiall figure, that hath borrowed Mortallitie, to mock the world withall. Anto. The duke is strangely alter'd. Treb. Past beleefe! Duke. Nay, it is soe: elce could her eares be deafe To my solicitations? If thou bee'st Compos'd of the same elements wee are, Instruct thy hart to loue, that I may find There's something in thee mortall! Anto. Marke Emilia, How her soule grates to heare this. Duke. Dearest Cloris, Thou dost not know my loue yett. Whisper. Treb. See Busiro, How hee looks crest-falne. Anto. Ha's bene at it lately. He has an ytch, the old goate must be frisking. Treb. Hee's very sad a'late; something lyes heauy on him. Anto. Those little leggs of his support a waight Of villainie wo'd make strong Atlas bend. Treb. But yet he hants the wenches at Romilia's To recreate his spirits. Anto. Hee may do any-thing. The duke thinks all complaints that come against him Proceed from enuie. 'Tis the miserie Of princes that they are debarr'd the freedome That wee enioy, they learne no other tunes But what theise whistle to 'em. Treb. If hee goes now a bulling, Hee may chance find the calfe his sonne before him. Enter Aramant. Anto. S'so, here comes Aramant. Treb. What do's hee heere? Ara. 'Tis shee, or elce my memorie's too actiue For all my faculties. My great preseruer, So nere the duke! I neuer heard of her. Am I myselfe? or is this some new fancie Shaping another ruine to my reason? I am not much distemper'd now; the greatest Passion I feele is mou'd by her faire eyesâ This litle peece of life knocks at the dore As if it wo'd breake out. I will speake to herâ Yet stayâthere's danger in'tâTo snatch a prey From a feirce lion's foot, doth argue rashnes Not resolution. See gazes on mee, And casts her eyes to heauen, as if her vowes Were written there. There is some secret in't. Treb. The duke is angrie! Duke. All forbeare the roome. Anto. This is some soudaine passionâLett's away. Exeunt. Duke. Cloris, I find my tendernes begetts A disrespect in thee; that which I thought To bee a harmelesse inocence, appeares Proud, and disdainefull follie: I did marke, When Aramant came in, how your blood danc't Vpon your cheekes, your eyes were riuetted As if you ment to fixe there, and my words Past vnregarded by. Clo. My lord, I fear'd Least the distemper which his iniuries Haue brought vpon him, sho'd breake into rage Here in your presence, to disturbe the quiet Of your faire mind. Duke. Come, that is not the cause. Can'st thou desire my quiett, and yett bee So cruell to mee? Clo. If I do not prize it More then my happines, then lett that leaue mee! I wo'd lay downe my life to buy your peace. Duke. This is a ridle. Would'st thou purchase that So dearely, which thou might'st so easily giue? Thy loue will doe it. Clo. Why, you haue it, sir; My dutie calls mee your's as y'are my prince, And as you haue rais'd mee to this height of fauor, Aboue the ascent of my desert, preseruing My honor free, you haue so farr oblig'd mee, Made mee so much a seruant to your goodnes, That my poore loue is lost in soe much merrit. Duke. Then I shall find it. 'Tis enough; I ioy In thy expressions, as condemned captiues In a repriue, when Death, with shaking hand, Doth threaten 'em. Deare Cloris, vse thy power In my great loue, make mee to show the world, There is not any thing man calls a blisse But what is in thee. Wilt thou not command mee? I cannot thinke thou lou'st mee, as thou sai'st, If that thou dost not fixe thy sole beleife, That I do prize no benefitt, this peice Of transitorie life can yeild to man, Equall vnto thy loue. Clo. How am I wretched, That I must yett refuse so great a blessing! Sir, I could weepe my eyes out, if your sufferings Wo'd bee lost with 'em: there is such a vertue Habituate in you, that it is more hard For mee to abandon such an noble loue, Then to confirme my peace of mind for vrging Vnkindnes from a hart soe full of goodnes. Duke. What meanes my Cloris? Clo. I am sorry, sir, You do not vnderstand mee, for I greiue To speake more of it, yett I may bee bolder, For sure there is some hidden power restraines My will in this affection, elce my blood Could not be circled in with such a snow! With greater sorrow, then example can Show to the eyes of men, I now must begg You wo'd not loue mee. Duke. 'Tis a strange request! And dost thou greiue to begg it toe? Clo. I doe. Duke. 'Tis an odd louing way, to begg the want Of what you most desire. Clo. Nay, you may thinke it Maddnes in mee; and indeed my mind Is much perplext, for it doth trouble mee To speake theise harsh words, more then you to heare 'em. Duke. This is some new-found way to try my loue; Thou can'st not make it greater. Doe not hold mee In this suspence, it may diminish itâ I am as subiect vnto passions as any other manâ Doe not prouoke meeâ I prithe do notâ'tis my loue intreats theeâ Thinke but of that and then thou wilt not change. Clo. I am not chang'd, sir. Duke. Noe! Did'st thou not tell mee That thou did'st prize mee more then happines? Aboue thy life? equall vnto thy soule? And do'st thou now recant? Clo. I am the same still, And euer wil be soe. I feele a dutie That ties my reuerence to you: I could kneele As to a father, and heere offer vp My teares to tell you, that my fate hath otherwise Dispos'd of mee. Duke. Yes, I haue found your haunt out, You doate on Aramant! I am too old, Fitter to bee a father then a husband! Is thy mind so lasciuious? I did thinke It had bene like thy lookes, without a blemish, Pure, cleare and innocent; but now I find Black lust inhabitts there. Clo. O, say not soe, sir! Kneels. Duke. I know not what to say indeed: myne anger Transports mee soe, and yett I am too calme, And beare too much. If my loue can doe nothing, Lett thy ambition moue thee! Is the name Of dutches in noe more regard? Can that Not stirr affection? Art thou not a woman? The dames of Burgundie will blush for thee When they shall know this. There is something in thee That calls to my remembrance, I had once A vertuous wife; for her faire sake I will not Vse thee with harshnes. Rise; me-thinks thou should'st Bee kinder to mee, for I cannot choose But loue thee dearely. Clo. If the same regard Holds not my hart in reuerentiall feare And dutie to your grace, then let mee neuer Haue libertie to looke vpon you more, Which if you barr mee from, I shall dye wretched. Duke. This is the strangest loue that e're was heard, Thou shouldst affect mee thus, yett shun'st the way That doth expresse it most. Clo. I loue your noblenes, And I could alwayes dwell with such a vertue. Duke. Come, theise are tricks to putt mee of; I will not Foole my selfe out of my desires; thy slownes Is fuell to my fire, which all thy teares Cannot extinguish. Doe not vrge mee further: I shall grow furiousâyett I cannot hurt her, There dwells such prittie innocencie in her! I am resolu'dâBusiro! Who's without there? Enter Busiro. Busi. Your graceâ Duke. Bee this your charge, and on your life Lett none come nere her. It is fitt that shee Should bee a prisoner, that doth captiue mee. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Romilia and Mela. Rom. Looke that the house be hansome; sweeten the roomes; Lay your best things abroadâthe lord Busiro Will bee heere presently. Mel. All shal be readie. Rom. Hee brings the Indies with him: 'tis his purse That giues vs meanes to eate, to drinke, to sleepe: Hee tyes vp all men's tougnesâa nobleman For a protector, and a courtier too, Is no meane base to build on. Mel. But, for the branch of the old tree, Pantarbo, What will you do with him? Rom. I'le mew him vp. I find the young lord coming, hee may happ To make vs all. But not a word of him To the old lord. Mel. I'm mute. Rom. About your busines, And I'le goe visitt my young sickly suckling. O, 'tis a bucksome boy! Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Pantarbo in an old night-gowne and capp, with a foule napkin about his necke. Pant. Shame a'your surgerie, if yee call this mending! My hurt is well enough, 'twas but a scratch: But now they haue crackt mee betwixt wind and water A'most past cure. Stay, let me feele my selfe. Shakes his leggs. 'Tis reasonable well yett. Troth, Romilia Is very kind. 'Tis a good wench, I warrant her, Shee is soe carefull. Heere shee comesâ Enter Romilia. Rom. Sweet lord, You will take cold; health is a tender thing. I wo'd not, for the wealth of Burgundie, You sho'd miscarry heere. Soe braue a courtier, One so compleately man! Preserue yourselfe: My house is your's, and so am I; your noblenes Inflames my hart to serue you. Pant. Why, I thank yee. I haue enough, you haue giuen mee enough. Rom. If any thing bee wanting, lett me know it: All that are mine attends yee. Y'are not merry; I do not find mirth sparkling in your eye, As it was wont. Pant. Who, I? I am all fire In my affection to thee, deare Romilia. I must goe scowre vp one a'old speeches Aside. To stop her mouth, I shall not be at quiet elce. Thy loue to mee is of more price, then number Or memorie can value; such a sweetnes The world's impouerisht in, for heere is all That man can call a blessing: smiles, wo'd tempt Carthusians from their cells: cheekes, lips, and eyes Wo'd make proud Loue himself a sacrifice. I doe restraine my fluent faculties From a full joy, elce my redundant hart Could not but bee too silent. Rom. Now it works. Aside. This is, my lord, too much the other way; If that you knew at what a deare regard I hold your worth, you would not mock your seruant. Pant. 'Slid! I must now professe what I but ieasted, Aside. Or I shall marr allâPrithee, pule not, wanton, I am in earnest; th'art a prittie sweeting. What I can say, or doe, shall both direct Their ends to thee. Come, come, thou knowst I loue thee. Rom. Then for my sweet, I'le haue delight, with wreathes To crowne thy browes. This lint shall vanish hence; Plentie shall deck thy tables, while the waiters Shall, like so many Bacchanalian nimphs, Dance thee a Thrasian round. Pant. This wil bee rare. Enter Mela. Rom. How now? Mel. The lord Busiro's at the door; Shift my young cub into his hole againe, Hee'le bee smelt out elce. Rom. My dearest lord, I haue the rarest pictures. Pant. I had rather Behold the substance. Rom. You shall see 'em all. But, pray, keepe warme. Pant. Theise are the kindest wenches. Exeunt. Enter Busiro solus. Busi. Conscience, thou followest mee; I cannot shun thee, No more then I can shun the wickednes I haue committed! There's a hell within mee. Who wo'd bee pollitique? This faire pretence Guilds many a foule crime o're; and to trust witches, And make 'em oracles of truth! What diuell Vrg'd me to this beleife? the sence of theise I faine wo'd mittigate, and cannot do it But by addition of as bad; and there's Another crosse tooâmy vngratious sonne I thinke is dead; I haue not heard of him Since his last hurt. There's nothing now but women Can putt new life into mee; when I see 'em, I shall forgett the miseries I suffer, As if I had drunke LethÃ¦. Who's within there? Enter Romilia, two or three Wenches. Rom. My gratious lord! Busi. How now my wanton flippitt? Where are thy ging of sweetnes? this is mettle To coyne young Cupids in. Wo'd each haire That fronts this face co'd like a circling serpent Twine 'bout your naked limbs! Alas I'me old, But yett I haue a mind as vigorous As a hott veined negro. Farewell Care, I banish thee for euer; lett vs sett And tast a banquett wo'd make Cleopatra A bankrupt to prouide, while from theise cates, Like Eson's bath, wee do renew our strength To a new world of blish. Rom. My deare lord's welcome. Busi. Now I am in my sphere: me thinks I looke Like Joue in his bright orbe. O for a dram Of that elixar, that made Hercules Incounter fiftie maids, and make 'em mothers All in one night! Crowne mee a boule of wine. Heere is a health to our great patronesse, And her blind son; lett it goe round. Rom. More wine. Busi. Yett this is but a blast, a flash of ioy: Aside. There is a hidden horror in my breast I cannot shake of. Rom. What d'ye want, my lord? Busi. Nothing; a toy I thought on. Fill more wine. Rom. Come, Mela, sing the song you studied last. [Mela] SONG. 1. If I were a wanton louer, I should choose age in my pride, For a young man will discouer, What a graue old man will hide; Give me age that knowes desire; Greene wood make more smoake then fire. 2. Would I find a man to right mee, When I haue sustain'd a wrong; Age shall do't, that doth delight mee, Youth is valiant but in tougne; Youth, like twigs, each storme will rend, Age is stiff, and will not bend. 3. Haue I secretts that opresse mee, Till I doe my mind impart; Age's councell may redresse mee, Hee alone shall haue my hart. Youth is fickle, full of rage, Light, inconstant; giue mee age. Busi. Are you of that mind too? Pantarbo above. All. Wee all are soe. Busi. Good girles, good girles! Pant. O thou old incubus! Aside. So many wenches at a clap! 'Tis strange, One that lookes like the master of Bridewell Sho'd loue the game soe. How he grins and wehes! Hee's myne owne father right, a plaine Sir Pecksell, A gray-rump stallion. I'le preserue thy bones, When thou art dead; they will bee excellent For readie propogation. A knock within. Mela. Who's that knocks? Busi. Keepe fast the dore. Serv. It is one from the duke Wo'd speake with lord Busiro. Busi. Hang his busines! Farwell, farwell, good wenches! I will find Some other timeâI thanke yee, I thanke yee all. Exeunt. Pant. This is some new state trick to keepe th'old man From his deare recreation. Well, the prouerbe âFollow thy father, good son!â you heere shall see: If it bee good for him, 'tis good for mee.

      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS QUARTUS. Scena Prima. Antonio and Trebutio. Anto. But is not Millecert yet heard of? Treb. Noe. Anto. Well, 'tis a noble part of him to giue The land agen; that is some recompence; For 'tis not now in fashion to restore Ill gotten goods, or 'knowledge iniuries. Justice, that shelters others, cannot now Preserue her owne hide in securitie: Shee's gon at comon law, man. Treb. What a sea, A troubled and vnbounded sea this world is For our great men to wade in. Anto. Yet they doe Some things, sometimes, they ha' but little ground for. Treb. O they diue deepe then. Anto. They will measure out This span of life by a long fathome line, As if it had no end; and, to tell truth, All that they doe is to as litle purpose. Treb. Methinks the duke of late is strangely alter'd. Anto. Hee is in loue, and that will alter any man. Treb. Since our good dutches died, he hath not lookt Vpon a woman that way. Anto. But the fitt Is now come on him, and I wonder Cloris Is so reseru'd; shee comes of a good straine: Here sister wo'd not bee soe. Treb. Heere comes Aramant. Enter Aramant. Anto. How do's my freind? Ara. Sick! almost mad agen! Anto. Cannot thy land restore thee? Ara. 'Tis but drosse, And sauers of the minds that are possest wo't. Can I bee well, and haue my great preseruer Imprisoned by this rigorous duke? My soule Suffers in her affliction. O my freinds, Thinke but how much I'me bound in gratitude To loue this harmeles maid! Call it not change, Or ficklenes; brute beasts affect good turnes, And oft requite 'emâShall I bee more sauage? Treb. If this bee shee, how do you know she loues you? Ara. I'me sure 'tis shee, and I know I am bound Howeuer to loue her; doe but consider What she indur'd for mee, when shee expos'd Her life to wild beasts, and her dearer honor To men more cruell! If you haue a charitie, A loue to goodnes, thinke what this can merrit. Anto. Come, leaue this whiningây'aue bene vext enough With one alreadie: can you hope for better In any of the tribe? Ara. In her I doe. Anto. There is no safetie in the sexe. Ara. Forbeare, Pri'thee forbeare to say soe. Which of you Can lett so great a benefitt be lost, And not find recompence? Anto. Why, that can I. Ara. You are hard harted then. Treb. Here's one to match him. Enter Busiro and Emilia. Anto. This is a match indeed wo'd blow mee vp. Take heed, old gunpowder! Now they are hatching Cockatrice eggs, and yet they shall not breed Worse monsters then themselues. Emil. His name is Gratus, A man of such parts, as are seldome found In one of his ranke; doe but heare him speake; His words caught mee. Your lordship may haue vse Of such a seruant. Busi. Madame, for your sake, Hee shall haue more then ordinarie trust. I'le put him to bee keeper to your sister. Emil. And hee'le discharge it well. Now I may bee Aside. Reveng'd on Millecert for sleighting mee. I ha' the plott all ready, and this Gratus Shal be my agent. My lord, your fauor Frames mee for euer your's. Busi. It is your merrit, ladie. Anto. Take heed, old lord, you are beseidg'd: there is A pettard hanging at your port, that breaks Downe all before it. Busi. Madame, giue noe eare To theise vnciuill men. I must withdrawe Vnto my charge. Exit. Emil. I find a shame about mee, That makes a barr betwixt your innocence And my great guilt, elce I sho'd aske your pardon; But my offences are soe great, they cannot Hope such a fauor. Ara. This is prittie language! Emil. Sir, I haue wrong'd you much, and baffeld yee, Taken your yonger brother and abus'd him: I vrged him to forsake mee for some ends, Which now I much repent of; and your freinds, Your noble freinds, (whose vertues I admire For being constant in calamitie To those they loue,) shal be a witnes for mee, How much I loath myselfe. Ara. If this be serious, I doe forgiue thee. Treb. So doe I. Anto. And I: and that is strange, I sho'd be drawne to't. But I'le be sworne I loue thee now. Emil. Ha, ha, ha! Anto. Wee are abus'd! Emil. Yee shotten witted fellowes, D'yee thinke that I can beare your frumps and ieares Without reuenge? I wil be armed for yee At your owne weapon. And you, wandring mastiff, That baited mee y'my owne house, I'le haue A fellowship for you y'the beare's colledge, And haue you tied vp with a studded coller. Anto. Here's a wench, lads, to fright a constable, And the whole watch with! Emil. And for light-braines, your brother, That now hath purg'd himself of his estate As well as of his witt, I'le phisick him for 't. Farewell, good sheepe's-heads! Exit Emilia. Anto. Pry'thee let me beat her; My fingers ytch. Treb. Nay, Antonio, you loue her! Anto. I'le loue a furie first. This is th'old dam of 'em; And if I thought the rage and spight of time Wo'd blast the world with such another spirit, I wo'd turne coniurer, and 'countermyne wo'tt. Ara. Lett vs not thinke of her, not loose a thought Vpon so wild a creature. I am now Soe hardned with her follies, that they touch me not. Betwixt her sister and her ther's strange disparitie, Nature ne're held greater antipithie. I must do something for that gentle maid; The help shee brought mee in my miserie Claimes the like gratitude. Anto. 'Tis dangerousâ Ara. For those that feare; but I will sett her free, Or bee her partner in captiuitie. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Seruant. Serv. Since my lord entertain'd his last new seruant I can haue no admittance: hee's a fauorit At the first dash; I feare there is small good Intended, that Emilia did prefer him; I do not like that skirtfoist. Leave your bouncing! Knock without. My lord 'le bee out on's witts to see this swarme Of suitors knocking at the gates. Bee quiett, Knock. Or hee will quiet yee. Who wo'd be great To be thus hated? They do curse and sweare To pull him out of's house. They will be righted. Knock. Knock till your harts ake: if the people's voice Can make men guilty, hee is soe. Hee comes heere, And his new seruant with him. Enter Busiro; Millecert disguis'd. Busi. What's the matter? Without. My lord, our case is desperate; wee must speake wi' yee. Busi. I will not heare yee; neuer was man Pester'd with raskalls soe. Without. Giue vs our due then. Busi. Go, tell the duke; I doe defie you all: Hee's y'the groues. Without. Wee thanke you yett for this. Exit Ser. Busi. Looke the dores be fast; this scum of people Doth vex mee terriblyâbut to our busines. Hast thou the art to tie the female fancie To the beleife of thy alluring tougne? Mille. No magick stronger; let mee but haue time And place, the instruments whereby wee worke, And, like a subtill ingenier, myne art Shall vndermyne 'em; not a chastitie Shall haue the power to stand the batterie Of my temptations. Busi. But how do you this? Mille. Why not the woman's way, your female baud, To tempt 'em with new gownes, rings, or such toyes, Or warme their cold bloods with the ambition To bee a great man's mistris; that's too comon. Busi. This is a cunning fellow. Mille. No; my way Is more sublime. When I ha' found her humor, I'le creepe into her heart, and cloth my words Soe suitable vnto her owne desires, Mixt with such innocencie and smooth language, It shall not find resistance; nay, sometimes Drawe teares to win beleife, till the warme dropps Soften the virgin waxe, and make it take Any impression. Busi. Wee shall try your skill. Haue you bene yett with Cloris? Mille. Yes, my lord. Busi. How doe you find her? Mille. 'Tis a gentle sweetnes. Busi. May shee be wonne? Mille. No doubt, my lord. Busi. The duke Loues her extreamely. May shee not be drawne To loue an old man too? Mille. With no great difficultie. Sin, thou art euer youthfull! Aside. Busi. Why should I Add more vnto my crimes? Aside. Enter The Duke. Duke. How now, Busiro! Is this the man? Busi. It is, my gratious lord. Duke. And wilt thou vndertake so great a taske With perill of thy life? Mille. I'le doe my best, sir. Duke. Thou run'st a dangerous hazard. 'Tis more easie To plough the frozen North, and force a way Vnto the Eastern world; or scale the Alpes, When the cold Eurus, with his snowy wings, Doth couer their rough topps, then alter Cloris In her most firme resolues. Mille. Yett I will venture. Duke. What is thy name? Mille. Gratus. Duke. Go on then, Gratus, And vse what skill thou can'st to make her loue mee. I need not teach thee what to say, thou hast An art beyond mee; for my elloquence, Like a rude blast of wind beating against That marble-harted heauen, doth find resistance, So that it onely serues to fann my fires: But pri'thee vse her gently; do not hurt herâ I wo'd not haue her hurt for all the blessings This world affords. Busiro, I must chide you; I cannot bee at quiet for complaints That come against you. Busi. 'Tis your highnes' fauor That pulls this enuie on mee. Duke. So you say still. But it behoues a prince that wo'd be iust To search the corners of corrupted courts, Which oft contract foule matter. The sun's beames Sometimes produces serpents, wormes and monsters, Yett 'tis not his fault, but the soyle's distempers Whereon his beames reflect; for otherwise His light doth cherish and reuiue. Soe fauors Proceeding from a prince may bee abus'd, And proue obnoxious. Take heed, old man! Busi. My lord, they are a people full of mallice That thus informes you, opposit to greatnes, And swolne with enuie breake out to distroy What you haue planted. But my seruicesâ Duke. No more, I do beleeue thee. Now, good Gratus, Attend thy busines, thou shalt find mee thankefull: But still be faithfull, or expect the furie Of an abused prince. Exeunt Duke and Busiro. Mille. I waigh it notâ My life I value meanely, soe I may Repaire the wrongs my noble brother suffers. The woman's yoke I haue shak'd of, and giuen him His land agen, but that is not enough. I heard that hee lou'd Cloris and shee him, Therefore I tooke this shape, and made my way To lord Busiro. Little thinks Emilia, Whome shee did recommend. O woman, woman! What fatall tempest droue mee on this rock, Vnhappie that I am? Enter Aramant. Who's this? my brother! Hee shall not know mee, till I doe appeare More louely to him. Ara. Heere about it is; Within theise rotten walls there lyes inclos'd The world's cheife beautie. Cloris, my faire saint, It is thy patient calls. I'le gett some ladders Shall reach to my desires. Where are my witts? My loue and gratitude is dull and stupid. Mille. Who's there? Ara. I am discouer'd. Drawes. Mille. Sir, this place Is, by the duke's command, prohibited. Ara. Stand further of! The duke may chaine my bodie, But cannot keepe my mind from mounting with The wings of loue vnto this place of rest. Mille. Are you not Aramant? Ara. The same. Mille. I pitty yee For your great iniuries: putt vp your sword; Your worth hath made a place within my breast That time shall not demolish. Ara. May I trust thee? Thou art a stranger to mee. Mille. Lett the obiect You do incounter next beare witnes for mee, How much I prise your loue. Exit. Ara. This fellow may Betray mee to the duke, but I'me resolu'd To beare the worst of mallice. Enter Cloris. 'Tis faire Cloris! My angell guardian! How shall I appeare Before you, madame, to expresse a mind Thankfull for all your mercies? If there bee Any thing in mee capable of gratitude Your charitie gaue it life; you fram'd mee new, Built mee from ruinesâThis poore tenement Had perished, and bene vnfitt for euer For Reason to abide in, if your goodnes Had not repair'd it, for which I must owe you All that I doe, or euer can, call happie. Clo. Are you the iniur'd Aramant, that drawes A pitty from all eyes? Ara. Madame, I am That Aramant that calls them happie howers That gaue his crosses birth, since they deriue A pittie from such sweetnes. Clo. 'Tis true, Aramant, Your many wrongs did worke vpon my easines, And mou'd compassion. Your iniuries I suffer'd with as much affliction, As if they 'had bene my owne. Judge mildly of mee, 'Twas a meere pittie. Ara. Giu 't some other nameâ Call it, deare saint, a loue, and make the ioy You haue inspir'd into mee such a comfort As none can wonder at, but those that haue Arriued at so much blisse. Clo. Alas, my loue Can yeild small benefitt vnto your wishes; I am a pris'ner heere, and who doth know If theise vnhappie eyes shall euer blesse The ayre you breath in more. Ara. Then I shall take A sad leaue of my selfe: I must confesse You may misdoubt my faith, because your eares Haue not bene pester'd yett with protestations; But I want art to make my loue suspected, For they, that marke my words, may trace their stepps Along the snowie path of innocence Vnto a loyall heart. Clo. I thinke yee noble. Ara. And lett not my credulitie begett Beleife in you, that I am apt to change, Because I did once fix my mind vpon Your worthlesse sister: ther's a higher power That doth dispose my loue now; 'tis a loue Aboue joy, pleasure, or delight; Without feare, ielousie, or appetite. Then doe not shame to name it, and that word, That litle word, will add a spirit vnto mee Aboue all power of man, equall to it selfe. Clo. But dare you trust a woman? I had thought My sister's wickednes had blasted all Respect vnto the sex. Ara. O neuer, madame, When it comes guarded with such innocence! I must confesse, if your faire vertues had not Giuen a new stamp vnto the rugged thoughts That crosse-peece of your sex imprinted in mee, I should haue buried all my hopes in her, Which now reuiue in you. Clo. Bee not too confident, Before you find iust cause. And yett you may, For I will ne're proue falce. Ara. Will you be mine then? Why should I aske more? I will tak't as granted. Lett me be found but worthie of this blessing, And I shall thinke my crosses were but stepps Vnto this height of joy. Clo. But ther's no hope Of freedome from this prison, for the duke Solicites howerly, by all meanes, to shake My fixed thoughts, which seeke no other obiect. Ara. I know his loue is arm'd with violence: For princes iudge of all things by their lusts, And measure loue by will, as if it were To be constrain'd, like the hott sun that burnes What it might cherish with a gentle warmth. They will, because they will; and doe confine Others to lawes which they themselues neglect. O, where is justice, that thou causelessly Should'st be imprison'd? Such a horrid parent Can ne're begett loue, though a monster like it. Clo. Mistake not, sir; for if there be a vertue That man can iustly call his owne, it dwells In this most noble prince. 'Tis true hee loues mee; And that great power, that doth distinguish loue In his effects, makes mee loue him agen. Be not you sad at thisâit is his goodnes, That, with a free soule, I admire and loue. A secret inspiration touches mee With reuerence to his person; and if you Had not possesst my heart before, I should Esteeme this seruitude the greatest freedome, That e're I co'd attaine to. Ara. I am chang'd thenâ For I had strange thoughts hammering in my breast, That prompted mee to vndertake a way For thy deliuerie, through the jawes of danger. Clo. Thinke not of any thing beares such a front, But let time worke. Beleeue mee, ther's noe prison, No power, nor no respect, no life, no death, Nor any thing that may invite, or threat, Shall hinder mee from truly loving thee. Doe I not blush to speake theise words? Ara. They are Like gold refin'd by triall. Cease, my ioyes, And prize this vertue rightly to the value; Tell her my actions shallâ Clo. Peace, here's my keeperâ Enter Millecert. Yett hee's a good man, and doth promise mee His best assistance. Ara. O, my worthie freind, How shall I merrit this? Mille. Lett not that trouble yee: When you shall find my seruice meet your wishes, Esteeme mee then. For this time I must part you; I feare the coming of some visitants. I must be circumspectâthe next occasion Expect a happier meeting. Clo. Farewell, Aramant, Thinke of poore Cloris. Exeunt Cloris and Millecert. Ara. Louely saint, farwell. Thinke of poore Cloris! When my thoughts shall leaue So sweet an apprehension, lett this clodd Of earth, that doth inclose 'em, fall to dust! I'le thinke of thee, and raise a spirit vp Shall toyle for thee, for I will either haue Thy freedome, or prepare myselfe a graue. Exit. Scena Tertia. Enter Emilia and Millecert. Emil. This is the place; I'le knock. Gratus, well mett; How do's thy charge? Mille. Hard harted to the duke still. Emil. It speakes her pride and folly; shee deserues not So great a fortune; the pure adamant Turnes to the eleuated North, but shee Is countersett, and the disparitie Betwixt their bloods doth draw her courser nature To this disvnion; 'tis the hand of Fate To keepe the duke from coupling with such basenes. Mille. Shee is your sister, madame. Emil. I dispise her; Shee hath no part of blood in mee, but borrowes The name of sister onely; were shee noble, It would appeare in this; for noblenes Finds out its proper object. Mille. Then how came you To call her sister? Emil. I did euer thinke Shee was so, till my father on his death-bed Told me, he found her (being a litle child Wrapt in a mantle) in the groues of Cloris, (From whence shee had her name,) being expos'd there Vnto the fury of wild beasts: hee bred her (I being then but young) as his owne daughter, And dying left vs equall portions; But her great beautie adding to my anger To see my selfe so mated by an outcast, When hee was dead, I kept her close from viewe, 'Till shee stole from meeâand this is Cloris. Mille. Shee may bee basely-borne then? Emil. 'Tis my feare, Which made mee breake this to thee. Thou art wise, And hast the duke's eare; 'tis not fitt his greatnes Should be diminisht thus, to match with one, That may add shame to his posteritie, And lay a brand vpon his name! I charge thee, As thou dost prize his well growne happines, Put out this soudaine flame. Mille. The duke's affection Is violent, and I shall run a hazard Equall to ruine, if I should neglect His strickt command. Emil. Turne it some other way then. Let the swift currant of his loue find out A nobler source. Wilt thou be secret, Gratus? Thy lookes are full of honestie; I dare Vnrip my breast to theeâI loue the duke! Mille. I smell this changeling out; she blasts her sister To grow herselfe. Aside. Emil. And it is in thy power To meet my wishes. Can'st thou not convert That loue to mee, that hee doth beare to Cloris? Me thinks 'twere easie. Mille. To be dam'dâWhy, madame, Aside. Ther's danger in such enterprises; how Can't possibly bee effected? Emil. You may feed The duke with hope of Cloris' loue, and when His expectation is drawne high, how soone May his desires be changed by the obiect! I am not much lesse faire. Mille. But I haue heard, You haue a husband, lady, nobly borne, Whose spirit will neuer brooke to meet a riuall, Or yeild to any second. Emil. Hee's a foole, An narrow harted man, and my spirit cannot Stoope to such weaknes; meaner thoughts are fitter For his cold temper, mine are fram'd for princes; The great duke now is all my ayme; I am Me thinks inthron'd alreadie, and the great ones Pay homage to mee, while my Gratus shall Diuide the pretious spoile with his Emilia: Wee'le part our glorie. Wilt thou work for mee? Mille. This I will promise you, the duke shall neuer Inioy faire Cloris. Emil. Doe but add the rest, And be it thyne honor to creat a dutches To bee thy seruant. Mille. I'le do something for you. Quench not my reason, (frailtie;) 'tis a woman, Aside. I should run mad elce; but in this is heap'd The whole contracted venome of the sex; Yet shee shall help to salue this wound, as poison Doth cleare distempers; Cloris shall be free, And rescued by her greatest enemie.â I ha' bene studying for you, madame, and Find your's the best way; you shall vrge the duke For leaue to visitt Cloris, with pretence Of pleading for him; which effected, 'tis But a mistake to bring him to your bed Instead of her's, and hee shall think it Cloris. But to dispose of herâ Emil. Leaue that to mee. Exit Emilia. Mille. But I will watch yee; for thou shalt not bee Wicked by my meanes. This inconstant woman Persues her falcehood, wil be true to no man. Enter Busiro. Busi. Gratus, how goes it now? the duke's impatient Of theise delayes. Mille. My lord, shee doth begin To melt alreadie. Pray, inform his highnes There is a ioy approaching, that will raise His drooping spirits. Busi. But a sadnes must Possesse my breast; nothing can cure my greife. Mille. How do's your lordship? are you well? distempers Are but a superfluitie of humour, That in the growth wil be disperc'd: but once Growne to a head may proue incurableâ Bee well aduis'd. Busi. I wo'd I had bene soe. Mille. Heere is some hidden thing I must worke out. Aside. The bodies' greifs (my lord) want not their cures Either to discipate, or to preuent Th'insuing ills; the minds that are sublime And more elated, working on its passions, Doth find best cure in councell; I haue skill In both: you great men run a hazard Daring and dangerous; if your consciences Fall sick and faint, they may be comforted By good aduice; it is the prop that keepes 'em From swift precipitation, which missing, Their owne waight beares 'em downe. Busi. I haue bene wicked. Mille. Vnload yourselfe of that great burthen to mee, And I may bring you ease. Busi. I thinke thee honest, And thou shalt know my heart. Let vs withdrawe. Mille. If't bee not treason, I wil be your cabinet. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS QUINTUS. Scena Prima. Aramant, Antonio, and Trebutio. Ara. Nay, it is true. Anto. It is the strangest storie That e're I heard, to haue a woman, young, In her cheife height of pride, arm'd with a beautie Wo'd giue ambition life, refuse a prince, And one of his worthâif this be no fable, I'le be converted, and confesse, I haue Abused the sex. Treb. But put the case, shee loues you; You meet a danger in depriuing of The duke of his desires, equall to death. Ara. Were it as certaine as the hand of Fate, I wo'd incounter it. This life is poore, And wants as much of true felicitie, As there is hell to be depriued of her; Lett danger meet mee in the ruggedst way, Her lookes will smooth it. Anto. Well, wee'le venture wi' yee, And beare some share of losse in this great ruine: You shall not sinke alone. Ara. But Gratus sayes, Hee'le stand betwixt vs and the prince's anger, And beare the waight of all. Anto. That's as strange too, A miracle to mee: to haue a stranger, Bound by no tie of dutie or allyance, Vnknowne, but in this act, ingage himselfe To an apparent ruine; 'tis a wonder Ages of time produce not, and I thinke it Rather some plott for your distruction. Ara. Come what will come, I'le venture! Time drawes on That wee must meet. Treb. Go then, and bee as happie, As thou art confident. Anto. Wee will fall with thee. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Emilia and Millecert. Emil. Cloris, thou neuer more shalt trouble vs. Now shee is dead, the duke will bury with her All his affection. Where's the breathles trunke? Mille. I threw it downe into a precipice, Where it shall neuer rise 'till the last summons. Emil. There lett her rest, while I prepare myselfe For this great entertaynment; I do feele My blood, like to a swelling streame, rise high, And time is dull, that binds it. Mille. I am thinking What wee shall answere to excuse the murder, If the duke should find out you are not Cloris. Emil. Tell him shee 'skapt away. Where are thy spirits? Mille. I am prepar'dâMake readie Cloris' bed, And fitt yourselfe; the duke will straite bee heere. Emil. Leaue that to mee. Exit Emilia. Mille. What horrid nature strain'd This mortall fury into humane shape? The soule of that blest innocent her sister Had fled to ayre by a strong venomb'd poison, If my preuention had not bene as actiue As her abhor'd intent. Enter Aramant, Antonio, and Trebutio. Ara. Here hee isâGratus, Where is my Cloris? Mille. You are come as wisht for; The time is ripeâCome forth thou starr of beautie From that obscuritie, and tell the world, Enter Cloris. They wander much, that doe not fixe on theeâ Shift for yourselues now, I haue done my part. Ara. What will become of thee? Mille. No matter what. Ara. How shall I recompence thy loue? What merrit Can equall thy deserving? Mille. 'Tis a dutie You may claime from mee; I do but requite you: And yett I hope it is the better change. Millecert discouers. Ara. My brother! Anto. Millecert! Treb. 'Tis strange! Ara. I'me poore, And shall dye wretched to the world, before I find a gratitude to equall this. I am thy double debtor; thou did'st pay mee In thy repentance, I did wish no more: The land, thou didst restore, did burthen mee; But this act layes so great a waight vpon mee, That, in my happines, I am but miserable. Mille. Doe not afflict your selfe soe, for my ioy, That I haue made you this small recompence, Is equall vnto yours, if not exceeds it: Make mee not sadd agen in trifling out The time in wordsâAway! Ara. I will not budge A foot without thee. Shall I leaue my brother, Nay more my freind, expos'd to the duke's furie For mee, and I in safetie? What shield, What armor can defend my name from infamie? Mille. You'le loose yourselfe elce, for I must stay heere To keepe the duke from the adulterate sheetes Of foule Emilia. You 'scapt well, madame; Shee thinks you dead. Clo. And so indeed I had bene, Had not you showne more worth, then I find merrit. Mille. Pray you be gonâThe duke's time is approaching. Ara. I shal bee loathsome to the eyes of men, If I forsake thee. Goe with my freinds, My dearest Cloris; I will suffer with him. Clo. And so will I with you. Mille. I'me sorry now, I did disclose myselfe. Anto. Come, bee aduis'd. Mille. Sir, I beseech you, vrge him. My disguize May further my escape; and if I liue, Within this hower you shall not faile to find mee At Aubin's cloister. Anto. Take his word. Ara. Farwell; And if you come not then, expect mee heere. Exeunt. Mille. 'Tis now about the time the duke appointed To meet his ioyes; but I must arme myselfe Against his furie, for I will preuent Emilia's lust, and, may bee, shun the danger Of his displeasure. Danger cannot fright, Vnlesse black guiltines putts out the light. Exit. Scena Tertia. Emilia, with a vaile on her face, lying on a bed. Enter Duke and Millecert. Duke. Gratus, thou bring'st mee to my happines, And I shall find out thine. Waite there without. Exit Millecert. Shee sleepes! What harmeles innocence abides In this faire mansion, where no horrid crimes Flutter with bloodie wings, to dissipate The soule's sweet quiet? Heere soft calmenes dwells, And all the pleasures poets' wandering fancies Haue framed in Elyzium. If my loue Did not pertake of passion more then reason, I should esteeme it happines enough To gaze vpon her thus. Emil. Who's there? my lord? Duke. It is thy freind, and loue, my gentle Cloris. Emil. Oh, sir! I dare not looke abroad: the light Wo'd but betray my blushes; do not glorie In a maid's weakenes, though I be your conquest. Duke. Bright day shall tell the world, that thou deseru'st To raise posteritie vnto a dukedome. Emil. Create mee what you please. Enter Millecert. Mille. Where is the duke? Cloris is murdred, murdred, poison'd By this inhumane woman heere, her sister. Duke. What rage is this? Emil. The villaine will betray all! Mille. It was her plott to gett your highnes' leaue To visett her for hate, not loue; and heere Shee exercised her pois'ning art, that shee Might take her place in your desired imbraces; Shee wo'd be dutches; shee's in loue with honor; And promis'd mee, if I wo'd giue assistance To her vnchast ends, I should reape some fruits In this great haruest; there is noe limite To her vnbounded lust. I hope this shame And feare will worke on her. Aside. Duke. What fury's this? Vnshroud thyselfe thou night-rauen; do not fill My soule with prodigiesâWhere is my Cloris? Emil. O, I am guiltieâShee is dead, but I Liue to bee miserable! Duke. Then thou hast rob'd mee Of all my happines at once. Did Nature In her rich treasurie frame such perfection For barbarous suffering? Breake out, my teares! And giue her passage to those happie shades, Where blessed soules abide; shee goes to tell vs, There was no difference 'twixt heauen's winged traine And her vnspotted innocence, but this, That diuells cannot hurt them; but to her They haue bene too, too cruell. Mille. If my brother Were not ingag'd in this, the duke's great passion Wo'd moue mee to disclose all. Duke. Hold my hand Misguided Reason, least thy iniured rage Sho'd make thee breake, and spend thy furie on This wicked woman; but the edge of justice Shall fall with all its waight vpon her head. Mille. I haue ingag'd myself too farr; her ruine Must not succeed by this; there is a way, That may recouer all yett. Duke. Who's without there? Enter Busiro, Seruius, and Tonsus. Busiro, Seruius, all come in, and bring Teares in your eyes, or if they haue no moisture, Lett 'em drop out, for shame they could not pay A tribute to such pittie. Busi. What's the matter? Duke. Cloris is dead! my prittie Cloris, poison'd; And by her cruell sister. Busi. Shame of woman! Duke. Nay, 'tis a shame to all humanitie, That shee should suffer thus. Why sho'd not goodnes For euer dwell among vs? 'Tis vniust, That the same instrument of death sho'd strike The good, and badd. Is there no better gard, No more defence for vertue? Then the vertuous Subsist with disadvantage, for they neuer Attempt such wicked crimes. But where's the bodie? Goe, fetch the bodie hether, that I may Embalme it with my teares; there is no drugg, Noe incense like true sorrowe. Mille. I am now Put to my shifts; what shall I say? My lord, I haue another accusation Against the lord Busiro, that requires A present hearing. Duke. Why d'yee trouble mee? Heere is enough of this; this is a storie Will rob mee of all pittie, and insence My mind to crueltie in future actions. Mille. But this is worse. Duke. It is impossible; Hell cannot find a horror to produce An act soe vile as this. Search the black booke Of sullen Fate, where crimes are character'd, Just as they are committed, freshe and bleeding, And in that burning catalogue you cannot Example this. Mille. Yett, doe but heare mee speake. Duke. Bee breife then in thy speech, and fright mee not With deathes and murders; lett thy tougne speake comfort. Busi. Wilt thou betray mee, slaue? Mille. No; it is treason, If I conceale such mischeifeâHad you not A daughter cal'd Bellaura? Duke. Yes; shee died, Going from Chalon castle to Besancon, Of an impostume, being but a child. Mille. This cruell and hard-harted man Busiro, Toutcht with the guilt of conscience, did confesse To mee, he hir'd a slaue to make away That prittie innocent. Busi. Heauen, thou art iust! Vrge me no further, sir; I did it. Duke. Yesâ Torture shall wring from thee, what was the cause, That did provoke thy black and bloodie soule To such a sin. Busi. Hee knowes allâlett him speake it. Mille. My lord, hee told mee, he was much addicted To diuination, and did striue to know Th'euents of things, soe that he did converse With witches, sorcerers, astrologers, Which calculated men's natiuities, And as they did oppose his ends, they suffred. Among the rest, a witch told him, Bellaura Sho'd bee his ruine, if she liu'd, which made him Attempt this crueltie, telling your highnes, Shee dyed of an impostume by the way. Duke. Haue you more greife to add to my dispaire? Giue me a third, and bring this feeble flesh To find a graue out. Where are all your witchcrafts, Your incantations now? The deuill's cunning, All his inventions are deceites; hee told you, That, if shee liu'd, shee should be your distruction; And shall shee not bee soe too, in her death? Will Heauen hide murder? Busi. O my gilt! Emil. And mine! Duke. Heere are a paire of the most cursed creatures, That euer earth bred. Search the wildernes, Whose rugged pathes are tract with horrid shapes, More vgly and deformed then the tougnes Of trauellers could e're deuise to make 'em, And theise are monsters to 'em; theise haue soules, That make 'em much more wretched. Slaue, haue I Protected thee against the iust complaints Of my wrong'd subjects? Now I must beleeue Thy smiles were crimes, what were thy cruelties? Call for a guardâWee will giue sentence. Enter Guard. Mille. Holdâ I must now take the ruine on myselfe Aside. To saue her from distruction that doth hate mee. Duke. Why dost thou bid mee hold? Mille. Do not proceed To sentence yett: th'intent is not the actâ Cloris yett liues. Duke. Where is shee? Mille. Shee is gon. Duke. Thou told'st mee, that Emilia poison'd her. Mille. And soe shee had, if my preuention Had not bene quick and cunning. Emil. Blessed hower! Thou didst deceyue mee? Wo'd, my tears co'd wash My crimes away. Mille. I like that sorrow well. Duke. Thou trifflest with mee, but to raise myne anger, And make the waight the greater. Where is Cloris? Find her agen, or if there be a torment, That may exceed the sence, thy soule shall feele it. Mille. You cannot fright mee, sir; I am resolu'd. Enter Antonio, Trebutio, Aramant, and Cloris. My brother come and Cloris! then I must Aside. Discouer all. Ara. Wee heard you were ingaged, Which made vs hast. Mille. Heere is your louely Cloris. Duke. 'Tis shee indeed. Art thou aliue agen, Thou greatest blessing of the world! The wealth, And treasure that men toyle for, is a triffle Compar'd to thee. Heere I do hold a iewell, That princes shall not purchase with their teares. I'le bee thy keeper now myselfe; no hands, With harts more barbarous, shall graspe this sweetnes, But soft and gentle touches, such as loue From his owne store alowes. Mille. Brother, feare not. Cloris, The streame will turn agen. Duke. No poisons now, Noe, not the venombe of a tougne shall touch Thy hallowed name; thou shalt be plac'd aboue The reach of black-iaw'd mallice. Hold, my breast! Containe my happines! When I behold thee, I feele a ioy, that reuells in my blood. Thy countenance doth harbor such a comfort, That it doth take away from all the greife My soule can bee possest of. Anto. Heere's small hope, Me'thinks, for Aramant. Treb. I n'ere saw lesse. Duke. Heere stands a guiltie one, as full of sinne, As mischeife can deuise. Thou shalt be iudge, If that I haue not cause to cut this vlcer That grew so nere my heartâProceede to iustice. Mille. Hold once agen! Duke. Thy voice is omenous. Mille. It brings sweet comfort now. Duke. O, speake it then, And make my ioy exceede my greife, for yett They are in equall ballance. Mille. The faire Cloris Is not Emilia's sister, but Bellaura. Duke. How know'st thou this? Mille. By circumstance, yet now Fully confirm'd in't; for Emilia Thinking to blast the loue you bore to Cloris, And turne it on herselfe, out of the rancor And mallice of her mind, told mee, this ladie Was but an outcast, not her sister: howe Her father found her, being a litle child, Within the groues of Cloris, and Busiro Did there expose the sweet Bellaura: It seemes, the slaue hee sent had not the heart To murder her. The times I haue computed, And they hitt iust; and you may find more signes, That may confirme it. Duke. Is this true? Emil. This scarff was found about her, and some other things Which I haue still preseru'd. Duke. If it bee shee, There is a strange blew marke vpon her armeâ 'Tis shee! the wiser powers sett this print on thee Knowing thy hard fate. This is my Bellaura. This scarff too was thy mother's; I remember it: It wasâit wasâmy daughter! My Bellaura! I knew there was some secrett, hidden vertue Forc'd mee to loue thee. Wilt thou still bee Cloris? Or my Bellaura? Which shall I loue best? My blessing on thee! Clo. The same force of loue Wrought in my breast, for I did honor you With as much zeale, as dutie could inforce From an obedient child. Duke. Thou did'st expresse it. Millecert discouers. But why did'st thou conceale this from mee? Millecert! Emil. My much abused husband! with what shame Can I behold him? Busi. All the powers of vertue Reward thee for thy newes. Mille. When I had found it, I purposed to conceale it, 'till my brother Had maryed Cloris, for I fear'd your highnes Might otherwise preuent it. Duke. T'had bene death to abuse mee soe. Mille. That co'd not fright mee, sir, So I did satisfie my brother's wrongs. Anto. Heere is some change. Treb. This may goe well. Duke. Bellaura Is the heire of princes, and shee must find out A nobler husband. Clo. Sir, lett mee kneele heere, She kneels. And growe for euer at your feet, to begg I may be still an outcast. Do not make mee Happie by such aduancement, and so soone Depriue mee of all ioy! lett me not bee, If not bee Aramant's. Duke. You must bee rul'd. Clo. Lett mee not lay a blemish on our sex; Man shall not haue th'aduantage to condemne All women for Inconstancie; I lou'd him, Intirely lou'd him, when I was but Cloris, And I must loue him, though I bee Bellauraâ Speake comfort to mee. Duke. Rise. She rises. Treb. Heere's a sweet soule. Anto. Women, I am a'your side now. Ara. My lord, The truth that I shall speake will but appeare Vaine glorie in mee, if I tell the world, There is no drop of blood within theise veines, But run from noble fountainesâYet my worth Cannot deserue Bellaura, 'tis your goodnesâ Duke. No more. Thou hast bene wrong'd, and now I find The heauenly powers do point the out this blessing To recompence thy suffrings; therefore take her, And all the deare ioyes love afford light on yee. All. And sweet peace crowne your vertues. Duke. For this wretch Myne anger bates its edge. I'le ha' no blood Spilt at theise nuptialls; yett the deuill's fallacie Shall hold in this: Bellaura's borne to bee Thy ruine, living; soe shee had bene too, If thou hadst murdred her: theise subtilties Delude abused soules, that loue to follow Forbidden pathes. Thy life is sau'd by banishment, But all thy goods the lawes shall seize vpon;â And for you, ladie, I do wish, you could Find a repentance. Emil. I will seek't with teares, And in those liquid streames bath this foule body To make it white agen. Farewell for euer! First to my iniur'd husband; then to all! I'le creepe into some cloister, where you neuer Shall see mee more; there lett me find your charitie, I cannot hope your pardon, (though no act Hath stain'd my soule with guilt). If you do heare I die a penetent, let fall a teare In pittie of mee, and my greiued spirit Will rest in peace. Anto. If this bee fiction toe, It is well acted. Treb. Nay, shee's now in earnest. Duke. Emilia, wee will all be suitors for thee, And make this a new mariage. Try her, Millecert; Repentance neuer comes to late. Ara., Clo. Deare brother, Make this a day of ioy. All. Wee all do begg it. Mille. Come, my Emilia; With as much loue, as when our first thoughts mett, Doe I imbrace thee; dry thy blubberd eyes, For through those christall casements I do see, Thou hast a greiued soule. Emil. I must retire; My faults will blush to looke vpon the light. Mille. Thou shalt not goe, vnles thou quit'st thy goodnes; For when such pearly iewells deck thyne eyes, Thou art a fitt companion for the saints. I'le loue the better for thy being lost. Emil. But dare you trust mee? Mille. Yes. Emil. Then you shall see A reform'd life, and a strange change in mee. Ara. Sweet peace attend yeeâNow, my noble freinds, That quit not freindship in aduersitie, I may requite your loues. Anto., Treb. Wee are your seruants. Clo. And, sister, I must thinke of honest Lauia: Nay, wee are sisters still. Emil. O dearest ladie! Anto. But what's become of my fine speaking lord? You went to visit him. Treb. Why, hee is safe; Romilia, and hee, I thinke, will neuer part. Enter Pantarbo in a thin garbe, Romilia following. Serv. Is not this hee? Anto. 'Tis hee, or elce his ghost. Pant. This spirit hants mee. O, for some neat beadle With charmes to lay her downe. There's not a mite Of marrow in my bones leftâO, my backâ Rom. I'le back your lordship, ne're a freind you haue Will back yee soe. Pant. Y'haue made a colt of mee, And tir'd mee too, broke mee of all my tricks, And you may lead mee now in a twine-thrid. OâOâmy back! Duke. Who's this? Anto. The lord Pantarbo. Duke. Hee is much chang'd. Anto. Hee keepes a vaulting schole, And come to showe his merri-trix. Busi. My shame. Pant. Nay, father; I haue trod your very steps; What sonne co'd bee more dutifull? now help mee, Or I am lost. Rom. My lord, I sue for iustice; Hee is my husband, ioyn'd by all loue's rights, And now hee wo'd vntie the knott. Anto. With reuerence! Duke. Pantarbo, is it soe? Pant. I must confesse, I had some speeches, that did treat of loue, Which I did speake to her in ieast; shee vrging My large professions, I was forc'dâ Duke. To marry her? Pant. 'Twas some such thing. Duke. 'Tis pittie then to part yee. But you must vse your trade no more, vnlesse You haue a supersedeas for the whipâ Take councell of that old man. Pant. Wicked womenâ Rom. Come husband, cheare vp; wee will driue a trade on't Shall gett a liuing. Duke. Take away Busiro, And lett his wise sonne and his daughter ioy In such a father. Wee will clense the court Of all theise locusts. Gentlemen, your loues Shal be requited. Thou art honest, Millecert, And hast return'd thy brother double interrest For all his wrongs; thy land shal be restor'd thee. I will prouide for theise, the onely hope And pleasure of my lifeâMay your faire branches Florish for euer, that the memorie Of vertue ne're may want an heire. You, ladie, Haue bene inconstant, therefore now indeuer A reformationâBetter late than neuer. END OF THE INCONSTANT LADIE.</field>
