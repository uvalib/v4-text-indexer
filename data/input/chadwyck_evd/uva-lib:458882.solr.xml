      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, Allegant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Roderigo, Lewys, and Diego. Lew. Roderigo. Die. Art mad? Ro. Yes, not so much with Wine, its as rare to see a Spaniard a drunkard, as a Germane sober, an Italian no Whoremonger, an English man to pay his debts. I am no Borachie, Sack, Maligo, nor Canary breeds the Calenture in my braines, mine eye mads me, not my cups. Lew. What would'st have us do? Ro. Doe? Die. So far as tis fit for a Gentlemen wee'l venture. Ro. I aske no more, I ha seen a thing has bewitched me, a delicate body, but this in the waste, Foot and Leg tempting, the Face I had a glimpse of: but the Fruit must needs be delicious, the Tree being so beautifull. Lew. Prithee to the point. Ro. Here tis, an old Gentleman, (no matter who he is) an old Gentlewoman (I ha nothing to do with her) but a young creature that followes them, Daughter or Servant, or whatsoever shee be her I must have, they are comming this way, shall I have her? I must have her. Die. How, how? Lew. Thou speak'st impossibilities. Ro. Easie, easie, easie, i'le seize the young girls: stop you the old man, stay you the old woman. Lew. How then? Ro. I'le fly off with the young Bird, that's all, many of our Spanish Gallants act these merry parts every night, they are weak and old, we young and sprightly, will you assist me? Lew. Troath Roderigo any thing in the way of honour. Ro. For a wench Man any course is honorable. Lew. Nay not any, her Father, if he her Father may be noble. Ro. I am as noble. Lew. Would the adventure were so. Ro. Stand close, they come. Enter Pedro, Maria, and Clara. Ped. 'Tis late would we were in Madrill. Ma. Go faster my Lord. Ped. Clara, keep close. They seize them. Cla. Helpe, helpe, helpe! Ro. Are you crying out? I'le be your Midwife. Exit with Clara. Ped. What mean you Gentlemen? Ma. Villaines, Thieves, Murderers. Ped. Do you know me? I am De Cortes, Pedro de Cortes! Lew. De Cortes, Diego, come away. Exit. Ped. Clara, where is my Daughter? Ma. Clara I these Villaines Have rob'd us of our comfort, and will, I feare, Her of her honour. Ped. This had not wont To be our Spanish Fashion, but now our Gallants, Our Gentry, our young Dons heated with Wine, (A fire our Country-men doe seldome sit at) Commit these outrages, Clara!âMaria, Let's homeward, I will raise Madrill to finde These traytors to all goodness, Clara. Ma. Clara. Exit. Enter Lewys and Diego. Lew. Oh Diego I am lost, I am mad! Die. So we are all. Lew. 'Tis not with wine, i'me drunk with too much horror, Inflam'd with rage, to see us two made Bawds To Roderigo's lust, did not the old man Name Decortes, Pedro de Cortes? Die. Sure he did. Lew. Oh Diego, as thou lov'st me, nay on the forfeit Of thine own life or mine, seale up thy lips, Let 'em not name De Cortes, stay, stay, stay, Roderigo has into his Fathers house A passage through a Garden. Die. Yes, my Lord. Lew. Thither I must finde Roderigo out, And check him, check him home, if he but dare No more; Diego along my soule does fight A thousand battailes blacker then this night. Exit. Enter Roderigo and Claria. Cla. Tho the black veyle of night hath over-clowded The World in darknesse, yet e're many howers The Sun will rise again, and then this act Of my dishonor will appear before you; More black then is the Canopy that shrowds it, What are you, pray what are you? Ro. Husht, a friend! a friend. Cla. A friend, be then a gentle Ravisher, An honorable villaine, as you have Disroab'd my youth of natures goodliest portion, My Virgin purity, so with your Sword Let out that blood which is infected now, By your soule-stayning lust. Ro. Pish. Cla. Are you noble? I know you then will marry me, say. Ro. Umh. Cla. Not speak to me! are want on Divells dumbe? How are so many harmelesse Virgins wrought By falshood of prevailing words to yeild To easie forfeits of their shames and liberty, If every Orator of folly plead In silence, like this untongu'd piece of violence? You shall not from me. Ro. Phew no more. Cla. You shall not, Who e're you are, Disease of natures sloth: Birth of some monstrous sinne, or scourge of virtue, Heavens wrath and mankinds burthen, I will hold you, I will, be rough and therein mercifull, I will not loose my hold else. Ro. There, 'tis gold. Cla. Gold, why! alas for what? the hire of pleasure, Perhaps is payment, mine is misery; I need no wages for a ruin'd name, More then a bleeding heart. Ro. Nay then y'are troublesome, I'le lock you safe enough. Exit. Cla. They cannot feare Whom grief hath arm'd with hate and scorn of life. Revenge I kneele to thee, alas 'gainst whom? By what name shall I pull Confusion down From Justice on his head that hath betrayd me? I know not where I am, up I beseech thee Thou Lady regent of the aire, the Moon, And lead me by thy light to some brave vengeance, It is a Chamber sure, the guilty Bed. Sad evidence against my losse of honour Assures so much, what's here, a window curtaine? Oh Heaven! the stars appeare 'too, ha! a chamber, A goodly one, dwells Rape in such a paradice! Help me my quickned senses, 'tis a garden To which this window guides the covetous prospect, A large one and a faire one, in the midst A curious Alablaster Fountaine stands, Fram'd like-like what? no matter, swift remembrance, Rich furniture within too! and what's this? A precious Crucifix? I have enough, Assist me oh you powers that guard the innocent. Enter Roderigo. Ro. Now! Cla. Welcome, if you come arm'd in destruction, I am prepar'd to die. Ro. Tell me your Name, And what you are. Cla. You urge me to a sinne As cruell as your lust, I dare not grant it, Thinke on the violence of my defame, And if you meane to write upon my Grave An Epitaph of peace, forbear to question, Or whence, or who I am; I know the heate Of your desires are after the performance Of such a hellish act, by this time drown'd In cooler streams of penance; and for my part I have wash'd off the Leaprosie that cleaves To my just shame, in true and honest teares; I must not leave a mention of my wrongs, The staine of my unspotted birth to memory, Let it lie buried with me in the dust, That never time hereafter may report How such a one as you have made mee live; Be resolute, and do not stagger, doe not, For I am nothing. Ro. Sweet let me enjoy thee Now with a free allowance. Cla. Ha, enjoy me! Insufferable villaine! Ro. Peace: speak low, I meane no second force, and since I find Such goodness in an unknown frame of virtue: Forgive my soule attempt, which I shall grieve for So hartily, that could you be your self Eye-witness to my constant vow'd repentance, Trust me you'd pitty me. Cla. Sir, you can speak now. Ro. So much I am the Executioner Of mine own trespasse, that I have no heart, Nor reason to disclose my name or quality; You must excuse me that, but trust me (faire one) Were this ill deede undone, this deed of wickednesse. I would be proud to court your love like him, Whom my first birth presented to the World: this for your satisfaction, What remaines, that you can challenge as a service from me? I both expect and beg it. Cla. First, that you swear neither In riot of your Mirth, in Passion Of Friendship, or in folly of Discourse, To speak of wrongs done to a ravish'd Maide. Ro. As I love truth I sweare. Cla. Next that you leade me Neere to the place you met me, and there leave me To my last fortunes e're the morning rise. Ro. Say more. Cla. Lay a new man, if e're you marry (Oh me! my heart's a breaking) but if e're You marry in a constant love to her That shall be then your Wife, redeem the fault Of my undoing, I am lost for ever, Pray use no more words. Ro. You must give me leave To veile you close. Cla. Do what you will, no time Can ransome me from sorrows or dishonors, Shall we now goe? Ro. My shame may live without me, But in my soul I beare my guilt about me, Lend me your hand, now follow. Exit. Enter Lewys, Diego, and a servant. Lu. Not yet come in, not yet? Ser. No i'le assure your Lordship, I have seldom known Him keep out so long, my Lord usually observes More seasonable houres. Lew. What time of night is't? Ser. On the stroake of three. Lew. The stroake of three! 'tis wondrous strange! Dost heare? Ser. My Lord. Lew. E're six I will be here againe, Tell thy Lord so: ere six,âa must not sleepe, Or if a doe, I shall be bold to wake him: Be sure thou tell'st himâdoe. Ser. My Lord I shall. Exit. Lew. Diego. Walke thou the street that leads about the Perado, I'le round the West part of the City, meet me At the Inquisition Chappell; if we misse him Wee'l both back to his Lodgings. Die. At the Chappell? Lew. I there wee'l meete. Die. Agreed, I this way. Exit. Lewys. Enter Don Iohn Reading. Jo. Shee is not noble, true, wise nature meant Affection should enable her discent, For love and beauty keeps as rich a seat Of sweetnesse in the meane borne, as the greatâ I am resolv'd. Exit. Die. 'Tis Roderigo certainly, Yet his voyce makes me doubt, but I'le ore-hear him. Ex. Enter Lewys. Lew. That if only I should be the Man Made accessary, and a party both To mine own torment, at a time so neere The birth of all those comforts I have travell'd with, So many, many howers of hopes and fears; Now at the instantâHa, stand! thy name, Truly and speedily. Enter Roderigo. Ro. Don Lewys! Lew. The same; but who art thouâspeake? Ro. Roderigo. Lew. Tell mee, As y'are a noble Gentleman, as ever You hope to be enrowl'd amongst the vertuous, As you love goodnesse, as you wish to inherit The blessednesse and fellowship of Angels, As you are my friend, as you are Roderigo, As you are any thing that would deserve A worthy name, where have you been to night? Oh! how have you dispos'd of that faire Creature Whom you led captive from me, speak, oh speak, Where, how, when, in what usage have you left her? Truth I require all truth. Ro. Tho I might question The strangenesse of your importunity; Yet cause I note distraction in the height Of curiosity, I will be plaine, and briefe. Lu. I thank you sir. Ro. Instead of feeding Too wantonly upon so rich a Banquet, I found even in that beauty that invited me Such a commanding majesty of chaste And humbly glorious vertue, that it did not More check my rash attempt, then draw to ebb The float of those desires, which in an instant Were cool'd in their own streames of shame and folly. Lu. Now all encrease of honours. Fall in full showers on thee Roderigo, The best man living. Ro. You are much transported With this discourse methinks. Lu. Yes, I am. Shee tould yee her Name too. Ro. I could not urge it By any importunity. Lu. Better still; Where did you leave her? Ro. Where I found her, farther Shee would by no means grant me to waite on her, Oh Luys I am lost. Lu. This selfe-same Lady Was shee to whom I have been long a Suiter, And shortly hope to marry. Ro. Shee your Mistris then? Luys, since friendship, And noble honesty conjures our loves To a continued league, here I unclaspe The secrets of my heart. Oh I have had A glimpse of such a Creature, that deserves A Temple, if thou lov'st her, (and I blame thee not) For who can look on her, and not give up His life unto her service? if thou lov'st her, For pitties sake conceale her; let me not As much as know her Name, there's a temption in't, Let me not know her Dwelling, Birth or Quality, Or any thing that she calls hers, but thee In thee my friend, I'le see her, and to avoyd The surfeits and those rarities that tempt me, So much I prize the happiness of friendship, That I will leave the City. Lew. Leave it. Ro. Speede me! For Salamanca, court my studies now For Phisick 'gainst infection of the minde. Lew. You doe amaze me! Ro. Here to live, and live Without her, is impossible and wretched. For Heavens sake never tell her what I was, Or that you know me, and when I finde that absence Hath lost her to my, memory, I'le dare To see yee againe meane time the cause that drawes mee From hence, shall be to all the World untol'd; No friend but thou alone, for whose sake only I undertake this voluntary exile Shall be partaker of my griefes; thy hand Farwell: and all the pleasures, joyes, contents That blesse a constant Lover, henceforth crown thee A happy Bridegroom. Lew. You have conquer'd friendship Beyond example. Enter Diego. Die. Ha, ha, ha I some one That hath slept well to night, should a but see mee Thus merry by my selfe, might justly think I were not well in my wits. Lew. Diego! Die. Yes 'tis I, and I have had a fine fegary, The rarest, Wild-goose chase. Lew. 'Thad made thee melancholy. Die. Don Roderigo here? 'tis well you met him; For tho I mist him, yet I met an accident Has almost made me burst with laughter. Lew. How so? Die. I'le tell you, as we parted, I perceiv'd A walking thing before me strangely tickled With rare conceited raptures, him I dogg'd, Supposing 'thad been Roderigo landed From his new Pinnace, deepe in contemplation Of the sweet voyage he stole to night. Ro. Y'are pleasant. Lew. Prithee who was't? Ro. Not I. Die. Y'are i'the right, not you indeed; For 'twas that noble Gentleman Don John, Son to the Counte Francisco de Carcomo. Lew. In love it seems. Die. Yes, pepperd on my life, Much good may't do him, Ide not be so lind For my Cap full of double Pistolets. Lew. What should his Mistris be? Die. That's yet a Riddle Beyond my resolution, but of late I have observ'd him oft to frequent The sports the Gipsies newly come to th'City present. Lew. 'Tis said there is a Creature with'em, Tho young of years, yet of such absolute beauty, Dexterity of wit, and generall qualities, That Spaine reports her not without admiration. Die. Have you seen her? Lew. Never. Die. Nor you my Lord? Ro. I not remember. Die. Why then you never saw the prettiest toy That ever Sung or Danc'd. Lew. Is shee a Gipsie? Die. In her condition, not in her complexion. I tell you once more, 'tis a sparke of beauty Able to set a World at gaze, the sweetest, The wittiest rogue, shalls see 'em? they have fine gambolls, Are mightily frequented, Court and City Flock to 'em, but the Country does 'em worship. This little Ape gets money by the sack full, It troules upon her. Lew. Will yee with us friend? Ro. You know my other projects, fights to me Are but vexations. Lew. Oh you must be merry, Diego, wee'l toth' Gipsies. Die. Best take heed You be not snap'd. Lew. How snap'd? Die. By that little Faire, 'Thas a shrewd tempting Face, and a notable Tongue. Lew. I fear not either. Die. Goe then. Lew. will you with us? Ro. I'le come after. Pleasure and youth like smiling evills wooe us, To taste new follies; tasted, they undoe us. Exeunt.</field>

Ant. A reade brave as a Courtiers, for some of them doe but shark, and so do we. Al. Gipsies, but no tann'd ones, no Red-oker rascalls umberd with soot and bacon as the English Gipsies are, that sally out upon Pullen, lie in ambuscado for a rope of Onions, as if they were Welsh Free-booters, no, our stile has higher steps to climbe over, Spanish Gipsies, noble Gipsies. Car. I never knew nobility in basenes. Alo. Basenes! the arts of Cocoquismo, and Germania us'd by our Spanish Pickeroes (I meane Filching, Foysting, Niming, Idling) we defie; none in our Colledge shall study 'em, such Graduates we degrade. An. I am glad Spaine has an honest company. Al. Wee'l entertaine no Mounty-bancking Stroule, No Piper, Fidler, Tumbler through small hoopes; No Ape carrier, Baboon bearer, We must have nothing stale, triviall or base: Am I your Major domo, your Teniente, Your Captaine, your Commander?

Be not English Gipsies, in whose companie a man's not sure of the eares of his head they so pilfer; no such angling; what you pull to Land catch faire; there is no Iron so foule but may be guilded, and our Gipsie profession how base soever in shew, may acquire commendations. Car. Gipsies, and yet pick no pockets? Al. Infamous and roguy, so handle your Webbs, that they never come to be woven in the Loome of Justice; take any thing that's given you, Purses, Knives, Handkerchers, Rosaries, Tweezes, any toy, any money, refuse not a Maruade, a blanck, Feather by Feather birds build Nests, graine peckd up after graine, makes Pullen fat. An. The best is we Spaniards are no great feeders. Al. If one City cannot maintaine us, away to another, our horses must have wings; does Madrill yeild no money? Sivell shall; is Sivell close fisted? Vallidoly is open; so Cordica, so Toledo: doe not our Spanish Wines please us? Italian can then, French can, preferments bow is hard to draw, set all your strengths to it, what you get, keep, all the World is a second Rochill, make all sure, for you must not look to have your Dinner serv'd in with Trumpets. Cor. No, no, Sackbuts shall serve us. Ala. When you have money, hide it; sell all our horses but one. Ant. Why one? Al.

Tempted! tho I am no marke in respect of a huge But, yet I can tell you great bubbers have shot at me, and shot golden Arrowes, but I my selfe gave ayme, thus; wide, foure Bowes; short, three and a halfe; they that crack me shall finde me as hard as a Nut of Galisia, a Parrot I am, but my teeth too tender to crack a wantons Almond. Al.

Pre. How! I not a Changeling! Yes Father, I will play the changeling, I'le change my selfe into a thousand shapes To court our brave Spectators; I'le change my postures Into a thousand different variations, To draw even Ladies eyes to follow mine; I'le change my voyce into a thousand tones To chaine attention, not a changeling Father, None but my selfe shall play the changeling. Al. Do what thou wilt Pretiosa. What noise is this? A beating within. Enter Cardochia. Car. Here's Gentlemen swear all the oaths in Spaine they have seen you, must see you, and will see you. Al. To drown this noyse let 'em enter. Enter Sancho and Soto. San. Is your Play-house an Inne? a Gentleman cannot see you without crumpling his Taffaty cloake. Soto. Nay more then a Gentleman, his man being a deminitive Don too. San. Is this the little ape does the fine tricks? Pre. Come aloft Jack little ape! San. Would my Jack might come aloft, please you to set the water Mill, with the Ivory cogs in't a grinding my handfull of purging comfetts. Soto. My Master desires to have you loose from your company. Ped. Am I a Pigeon thinke you to be caught with Cummin-seeds? a flie to glew my wings to sweete-meates and so be tane? San. When do your gambolls begin? Al. Not till we ha din'd. San.

The comodity wrapd up in the Paper, are Verses, the warming Pan that puts heat into 'em, you fire-braind bastard of Helicon. Al. What's your Masters Name? Soto. His name is Don Tomazo Portacarico, Nunckle to young Don Hortado de Mendonza, Cosen german to the Conde de Tindilla, and naturall brother to Francisco de Bavadilla, one of the Commendadors of Alcantaro, a Gentleman of long standing. Pre. Verses! I love good ones, let me see 'em. San. Good ones! if they were not good ones, they should not come from mee, at the name of Verses I can stand on no ground. Pre. Here's gold too, who's is this? San. Whoe's but yours? if there been any fault in the Verses, I can mend it extempore; for a stich in a mans stocken not taken up in time ravells out all the rest. Soto. Botcherly Poetry, botcherly. Pre. Verses and gold! these then are golden Verses. San. Had every Verse a Pearle in the aye it should be thine. Pre. A pearle in mine eye! I thanke you for that, doe you wish mee blinde? San. I by this light doe I, that you may look upon nobodies crime but mine. Pre. I should be blind indeede! Al. Pray Sir read your Verses. San. Shall I sing 'em or say 'em? Al. Which you can best. Soto. Both scurvily. San. I'le set out a throate then.

Your own! by what tenure? Jo. Cupid entailes this Land upon me, I have wooed thee, thou art coy, by this aire I am a Bull of Tarisa, wild, mad for thee: you told I was some copper coyne, I am a Knight of Spaine, Don Francisco de Carcomo my Father, I Don John his Sonne, this paper tells you more, grumble not old Granam, (heeres gold) for I must by this white hand, marry this cherry-lip'd, sweet-mouth'd villaine.

Turne Gipsie! for two years! a capering Trade, And I in th'end may keepe a dancing Schoole, Having serv'd for't, Gipsie! I must turne, Oh beauty! the Suns fires cannot so burne. Exit. Enter Clara. Cla. I have offended, yet oh Heaven! thou knowst How much I have abhor'd even from my birth, A thought that tended to immodest folly; Yet I have fallen, thoughts with disgraces strive, And thus I live, and thus I die alive. Enter Pedro, and Maria. Pe. Fie Clara, thou dost court calamity too much. Ma. Yes Girle, thou dost. Pe. Why should we fret our eyes out with our teares! Weary complaints, 'tis fruitlesse, childish, Impatience, for when mischiefe hath wound up The full weight of the Ravishers foul Life, To an equall height of ripe iniquity, The poyse will by degrees, sinke down his Soule To a much lower, much more lasting ruine Then our joynt wrongs can challenge. Ped. Darknesse it selfe Will change nights sable brow, into a Sun-beame For a discovery, and be sure When ever we can learne what monster 'twas Hath rob'd thee of the Jewell held so precious, Our vengeance shall be noble. Pe. Royall, any thing; Till then lets live securely: to proclaime Our sadnesse were meere vanity. Cla. A needs not, I'le study to be merry. Pe. We are punish'd Maria justly, covetousnesse to match Our Daughter to that matchlesse piece of ignorance, Our foolish Ward, hath drawn this curse upon us. Ma. I feare it has! Pe. Off with this face of griefe. Enter Lewys, and Diego. Die. Here comes Don Lewys; noble sir. Lew. My Lord, I trust I have you and your Ladies leave To exchange a word with your faire Daughter. Pe. Leave and welcome, harke Maria, your eare too. Die. Mine my Lord. Lew. Deare Clara, I have often su'd for Love, And now desire you would at last be pleas'd To stile me yours. Cla. Mine eyes ne'r saw that Gentleman Whom I more nobly in my heart respected, Then I have you, yet you must Sir excuse me, If I resolve to use a while that freedome My younger dayes allow. Lew. But shall I hope? Cla. You will do injury to better fortunes To your own Merit, Greatnesse, and Advancement, Which I beseech you not to slack. Lew. Then heare me, If ever I embrace another choyce, Untill I know you elsewhere match'd, may all The chiefe of my Desires finde scorne and ruine. Cla. Oh me! Lew. Why sigh you Lady? Cla. Deede my Lord I am not well. Lew. Then all Discourse is tedious, I'le chuse some fitter time; till when faire Clara.â Cla. You shall not be unwelcome hither sir; That's all that I dare promise. Lew. Diego! Die. My Lord! Lew. What says Don Pedro? Die. Hee'l goe with you. Lew. Leave us: Shall I my Lord, entreate your privacy? Pe. Withdraw Maria, wee'l follow presently. Exit. Lew. The great Corigidor, whose politick streame Of popularity, glides on the shore Of every vulgar praise, hath often urged me To be a Suitor to his Catholick Majesty, For a repeale from banishment for him Who slew my Father, complements in vowes, And strange well studied promises of friendship, But what is new to mee, still as he Courts Assistance for Alvarez my grand enemy, Still he protests how ignorant he is, Whether Alvarez be alive or dead? To morrow is the day we have appointed For meeting at the Lord Francisco's house, The Earle of Carcomo; now my good Lord, The sum of my request is, you will please To lend your presence there, and witnesse wherein Our joynt accord consists. Ped. You shall command it. Lew. But first as you are noble, I beseech you Helpe mee with your advice, what you conceave Of great Fernando's importunity, Or whether you imagine that Alvarez Survive or not? Pe. It is a question sir Beyond my resolution, I remember The difference betwixt your noble Father, And Conde de Alvarez, how it sprung From a meer trifle first, a cast of Hawks, Whose made the swifter flight, whose could mount highest, Lie longest on the wing. From change of words Their controversie grew to blows, from blowes To Parties, thence to Faction, and in short I well remember how our streets were frighted With brawles, whose end was bloud, till when no friends Could mediate their discords: by the King A reconciliation was enforc'd, Death threaten'd the first occasioner Of breach, besides the confiscation Of Lands and Honours, yet at last they met Againe; againe they drew to sides, renew'd Their ancient quarrell, in which dismall uprore Your Father hand to hand fell by Alvarez, Alvarez fled, and after him the doome Of exile was set out; He as Report Was bold to voyce, retir'd himselfe to Rhodes, His Lands and Honours by the King bestow'd On you, but then an Infant. Lew. Ha, an Infant! Pe. His Wife the sister to the Corigidor, With a young Daughter, and some few that follow'd her By stealth were shipt for Rhodes, and by a storme Ship-wrack'd at Sea, but for the banish'd Conde, 'Twas never yet known what became of him, Here's all I can informe you. Lew. A repeale, Yes, I will sue for't, beg for't, buy it, any thing That may by possibility of friends, Or Money, I'le attempt. Pe. 'Tis a brave charity. Lew. Alas poore Lady, I could mourne for her! Her losse was Usury more then I covet; But for the Man, I'de sell my patrimony For his repeale, and run about the World To finde him out, there is no peace can dwell About my Fathers Tombe, till I have sacrific'd Some portion of revenge to his wrong'd ashes. You will along with me? Pe. You neede not question it. Lew. I have strange thoughts about me, two such furies Revell amidst my joyes as well may move Distraction in a Saint, Vengeance and Love, I'le follow sir. Pe. Pray lead the way: you know it. Exit. Enter Sancho, and Soto. Soto. How now! from whence come you sir? San. From fleaing my selfe sir. Soto. From playing with Fencers sir, and they have beat him out of his Cloaths sir. Pe. Cloake, Band, Rapier, all lost at Dice! San. Nor Cards neither. Soto. This was one of my Masters dog-dayes, and he would not sweat too much. San. It was mine own Goose, and I laid the Jiblets upon an other Coxcombs trencher, you are my Gardian, best beg me for a fool now. Soto. He that begs one begs tother. Pe. Does any Gentleman give away his things thus? San. Yes, and Gentlewomen give away their things too. Soto. To Gulls sometimes, and are Cony-catch'd for their labour. Pe. Wilt thou ever play the Coxcombe? San. If no other parts be given me, what would you have me do? Pe. Thy Father was as brave a Spaniard As ever spake the haute Castilian Tongue. San. Put me in Cloaths, I'le be as brave as he. Pe. This is the ninth time thou hast plaid the Asse, Flinging away thy trappings and thy cloath To cover others, and goe nak'd thy selfe. San. I'le make 'em up ten, because I'le be even with you. Pe. Once more your broken walls shall have new hangings. Soto. To be well hung, is all our desire. Pe. And what course take you next? San. What course? why my man Soto and I wil go make some maps. Pe. What maps? Soto. Not such Mapps as you wash houses with, but Mapps of Countries. San. I have an Unckle in Sivell, I'le go see him, an Aunt in Siena in Italy, I goe see her. Soto. A Cosen of mine in Rome, I goe to him with a Mortar. San. There's a Curtizan in Venice, I'le goe tickle her. Soto. Another in England, I'le goe tackle her. Pe. So, so, and where's the money to do all this? San. If my wookes being cut down cannot fill this Pocket, cut 'em into Trapsticks. Soto. And if his Acres being sould for a Maruedi, a Turffe for markes in Cages, cannot fill this Pocket, give 'em to Gold-finders. Pe. You'l gallop both to the Gallowes, so fare you well. Exit. San. And be hang'd you, new cloaths y'ad best. Soto. Foure cloaks, that you may give away three, and keep one. San. Wee'l live as merrily as beggers, lets both turne Gipsies. Soto. By any means, if they cog wee'l lie, if they tosse wee'l tumble. San. Both in a belly, rather then faile. Soto. Come then, wee'l be Gipsified. San. And tipsified too. Soto. And we will shew such tricks, and such rare gambolls. As shall put down the Elephant and Camels. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Roderigo Disguiz'd like an Italian. Ro. A thousand stings are in me! oh what vild prisons Make we our bodies, to our immortall souls! Brave Tenants to bad houses! 'tis a deare rent They pay for naughty Lodging: the soule, the Mistresse, The body, the Caroach that carries her, Sinnes the swift wheeles that hurry her away; Our Will the Coachman rashly driving on, Till Coach and Carriage both are quite o're throwne; My body yet scapes bruizes, that known thiefe Is not yet cal'd toth' bar, there's no true sence Of paine, but what the Law of conscience Condemns us to, I feele that, who would loose A Kingdome for a Cottage? an Estate Of perpetuity, for a mans Life? For annuity of that Life (pleasure) a sparke To those Celestiall fires that burne about us! A painted Star to that bright Firmament Of constellations, which each night are set Lighting our way, yet thither how few get? How many thousand in Madrill drink off The cup of lust, (and laughing) in one moneth Not whining as I doe? should this sad Lady Now meet me, do I know her? should this Temple (By me prophan'd) lie in the ruines here, The pieces would scarce shew her me:âwould they did Shee's Mistris to Don Lewysâby his steps, And this disguise I'le finde her; to Salamanca Thy Father thinks th'art gon; no close here stay Where e're thou travell'st, Scorpions stop thy way: these. Enter Sancho, and Soto as Gipsies. San. Soto, how doe I shew? Soto. Like a rusty Armor new scour'd, but Master how shew I? San. Like an Asse with a new pibal'd saddle on his back. Soto. If the Devil were a Taylor, he would scarce know us in these gaberdines. San. If a Taylor were the Divel, I'de not give a Lowse for him, if he should bring up this fashion amongst Gentlemen, and make it common. Ro. The freshnesse of the Morning be upon you both. San. The saltnesse of the Evening be upon you single. Ro. Be not displeas'd, that I abruptly thus Breake in upon your favors, your strange habits Invite me with desire, to understand Both what you are, and whence, because no Country (And I have measur'd some) shew me your like. Soto. Our like! no we should be sorry, we or our cloaths should be like fish, new, stale, and stinking in three days. San. If you aske whence we are, we are Egyptian Spaniards; if what, we are, ut, re, mi, fa, sol. Juglers, Tumblers, any thing, any where, every where. Ro. A good fate hither leades me by the hand, Your quality I love, the scenicall Schoole Has been my Tutor long in Italy, (For that's my Country,) there have I put on Sometimes the shape of a Comedian, And now and then some other. San. A Player! a brother of the tyring house. Soto. A Bird of the same feather. San. Welcome, wut turne Gipsie? Ro. I can nor Dance, nor Sing, but if my Pen From my invention can strike Musick tunes, My head and braines are yours. Soto. A Calves head and braines were better for my stomack. San. A rib of Poetry. Soto. A modicum of the Muses, a horse-shooe of Helicon. San. A Mag-py of Parnassus, welcome agen, I am a fire-brand of PhÅbus my selfe, wee'l invoke together, so you will not steale my Plot. Ro. 'Tis not my fashion. San. But now adayes, 'tis all the fashion. Soto. What was the last thing you writ, a Comedy? Ro. No 'twas a sad, too sad a Tragedy. Under these eves I'le shelter me. San. See here comes our company, Doe our tops spinne as you would have 'em? Soto. If not whip us round. San. I sent you a Letter to tell you we were upon a march. Enter Alvarez, Eugenia, Pretiosa, and the Gipsies. Al. And you are welcomeâyet these fooles will trouble us. Eu. Rich fooles shall buy our trouble. San. Hang Lands, it's nothing but Trees, Stones and Durt, old Father I have Gold to keepe up our stock, pretious Pretiosa, for whose sake I have thus transform'd my selfe out of a Gentleman into a Gipsie, thou shalt not want sweete Rimes my little Musk-cat, for besides my selfe here's an Italian Poet, on whom I pray throw your welcomes. Omnes. Hee's welcome! Pre. Sir, y'are most welcome, I love a Poet, So hee writes chastely, if your Pen can sell me Any smooth queint Romances, which I may sing, You shall have Bayes and Silver. Ro. Pretty heart no selling: What comes from me is free. San. And me too. Al. We shall be glad to use you sir, our sports Must be an Orchard bearing severall Trees And Fruits of severall taste; one pleasure dulls. A time may come, when we (besides these pastimes) May from the Grandoes and the Dons of Spaine Have leave to try our skill even on the Stage, And then your witts may helpe us. San. And mine too. Ro. They are your servants. Pre. Trip softly through the streets, till we arrive You know at whose house Father. Song. San. Trip it Gipsies, trip it fine, Shew tricks and lofty Capers; At threading Needles we repine, And leaping over Rapiers. Pindy Pandy rascall toyes, We scorne cutting Purses, Tho we live by making noyse, For cheating none can curse us. Over High-wayes, over low, And over Stones and Gravell, Tho we trip it on the Toe, And thus for Silver travell. Tho our Dances waste our backs, At night fat Capons mend them; Eggs well brew'd in Butterd'-sack, Our Wenches say befriend them. Oh that all the World were mad, Then should we have fine Dancing, Hobby horses would be had, And brave Girles keepe a prancing. Beggers would on Cock-horse ride, And Boobies fall a roaring, And Cuckolds tho no Hornes be spide, Be one another goring. Welcome Poet to our Ging, Make Rimes wee'l give thee reason, Canary Bees thy braines shall sting Mull-sack did ne're speake Treason. Peter-see-me shall wash thy nowle, And Malligo Glasses fox thee, If Poet thou tosse not bowle for bowle Thou shalt not kisse a Doxie. Exit. Enter Fernando, Francisco de Carcomo, Don Iohn Pedro, Maria, Lewys, and Diego. Fer. Lewys de Castro, since you circled are In such a golden Ring of worthy friends, Pray let me question you about that business You and I last conferd on. Lew. My Lord I wish it. Fer. Then Gentlemen tho you all know this man, Yet now looke on him well, and you shall finde Such mines of Spanish honor in his bosome, As but in few are treasur'd. Lew. Oh my good Lord! Fer. Hee's Son to that de Castro, o're whose Tombe Fame stands writing a booke which will take up The age of time to fill it with the stories Of his great acts, and that his honor'd Father Fell in the quarrell of those Families His own, and Don Alvarez de Castilla. Fra. The volume of those Families is too large, And too wide Printed in our memory. Lew. Would it had ne're come forth. Omnes. So wish we all. Fer. But heer's a Son as matchlesse as the Father, For hee mindes bravery: he lets blood his Spleene, Teares out the Leafe in which the Picture stands Of slaine de Castro, casts a Hill of Sand On all revenge, and stifles it. Omnes. 'Tis done nobly. Fer. For I by him am courted to sollicite The King for the repeale of poore Alvarez, Who lives a banish'd man some say in Naples. Pe. Some say in Arragon. Lew. No matter where, That Paper foulds in it my hand and heart, Petitioning the royalty of Spaine To free the good old man, and call him home; But what hope hath your Lordship that these beames Of grace shall shine upon me? Fer. The word Royall! Omnes. And that's enough. Lew. Then since this sluce is drawn up to encrease The streame, with pardon of these honord friends Let me set ope another, and that's this, That you my Lord Don Pedro, (and this Lady Your noble Wife) would in this faire assembly (If still you hold me Tenant to your favor) Repeale the promise, you so oft have made me, Touching the beautious Clara for my Wife. Pe. What I possesse in her before these Lords I freely once more give you. Al. And what's mine? To you (as right heire to it) I resigne. Omnes. What would you more? Lew. What would I more? the tree bowes down his head Gently to have me touch it, but when I offer To pluck the fruite, the top branch growes so high To mock my reaching hand, up it does flie; I have the Mothers smile, the Daughters frown. Omnes. Oh you must wooe hard! Fer. Wooe her well shee's thine own. Jo. That Law holds not 'mongst Gipsies, I shoot hard, And am wide off from the Marke. Florish. Enter Soto, with a Cornet in his hand. Fer. Is this my Lord your Musick? Fra. None of mine. Soto. A crew of Gipsies with desire, To shew their sports are at your Gates afire. Fra. How, how, my Gates afire Knave! Jo. Art panting? I am a fire I'me sure! Fer. What are the things they doe? Soto. They Friske, they Caper, Dance and Sing, Tell fortunes too (which is a very fine thing) They tumbleâhow? not up and down As Tumblers doe, but from Towne to Towne. Anticks they have, and Gipsie-masking, And toyes which you may have for asking; They come to devoure, nor Wine, nor good Cheere, But to earne money, if any be here. (But being ask'd, as I suppose, Your answer will be in your tother hose) For there's not a Gipsie amongst 'em that begs, But gets his living by his Tongue and Legs. If therefore you please Dons they shall come in, Now I have ended, let them begin. Omnes. I, I, by any means. Fra. But fellow bring you Musick along with you too. Soto. Yes my Lord, both lowd Musick, and still Musick, the loud is that which you have heard, and the still is that which no man can heare. Exit. Fer. A fine Knave. Fra. There is report of a faire Gipsie, A pretty little toy, whom all our Gallants In Madrill flock to looke on: this shee trow? Yes sure 'tis sheeâI should be sorry else. Enter Alvarez, Eugenia, Pretiosa, Roderigo, Sancho, Soto, and all the Gipsies. Song. 1. Come follow your Leader follow Our Convoy be Mars and Apollo, The Van comes brave up here, As hotly comes the Reare. Ans. Omn. Our Knackers are the Fifes and Drums, Sa, sa, the Gipsies Army comes. 2. Horsemen we need not feare There's none but footemen here; The Horse sure charge without; Or if they wheele about, Omn. Our Knackers are the shot that flie Pit a pat ratling in the Sky. 3. If once the great Ordnance play That's laughing, yet runne not away; But stand the push of Pike Scorne can but basely strike. Omn. Then let our Armies joyne and sing And pit a pat make our Knackers ring. 4. Arme, Arme, what Bands are those? They cannot be sure our foes; Weele not draw up our force, Nor muster any Horse, Omn. For since they pleas'd to view our sight Let's this way, this way, give delight. 5. A Councell of War lets call, Looke either to stand or fall; If our weake Army stands Thanke all these noble hands; Whose gates of Love being open throwne We enter, and then the Town's our owne. Fer. A very dainty thing. Fra. A handsome Creature. Ro. Looke what a pretty pit there's in her chin. Jo. Pit! 'tis a Grave to bury Lovers in. Ro. My Fathers disguise guard me. San. Soto, there's de Cortez my guardian; but he smells not us. Soto. Peace brother Gipsie, wud any one here know his fortune? Omnes. Good fortunes all of us. Pe. 'Tis I sir needs a good one, come sir what's mine? Ma. Mine and my husbands fortunes keepe together, Who is't tels mine? San. I, I, hold up Madam, feare not your pocket, for I ha but two Hands. You are sad, or mad, or glad For a couple of Cockes that cannot be had, Yet when abroad they have pick'd store of graint Doodle doo they will cry on your Dunghills againe. Ma. Indeed I misse an idle Gentleman, And a thing of his a foole, but neither sad Nor mad for them, would that were all the Lead Lying at my heart. Ped. What look'st thou on so long? Soto. So long! do you thinke good fortunes are fresh Herrings, to come in sholes? bad fortunes are like Mackerell at Midsummer, you have had a sore losse of late. Pe. I have indeed, what is't? Soto. I wonder it makes you not mad; for Through a gap in your Ground Thence late hath been stole A very fine Asse, and a very fine Fole, Take heede for I speake not by habs and by nabs, E're long you'l be horribly troubled with scabbs. Pe. I am now so, goe silly foole. Soto. Tha gin't him. San. Oh Soto, that Asse and Foale fattens me! Fer. The Mother of the Gipsies, what can shee do? I'le have about with her. Jo. I with the Gipsie Daughter. Fra. To her Boy! Eu. From you went a Dove away Which e're this had been more white, Then the silver Roabe of, Day, Her Eyes the Moone has none so bright. Sate shee now upon your hand Not the Crowne of Spaine could buy it; But 'tis flowne to such a Land, Never more shall you come nie it; Ha! yes if Palmestrie tell true, This Dove agen may flie to you. Fer. Thou art a lying Witch, I'le heare no more. San. If you be so hot sir, we can coole you with a Song. Soto. And when that Song's done, wee'l heat you agen with a dance. Lew. Stay deare sir, send for Clara, let her know her fortune. Ma. 'Tis too well known. Lew. 'Twill make her merry to be in this brave Company. Pe. Good Diego fetch her. Exit Diego. Fra. What's that old man! has he cunning too? Omnes. More then all we. Lew. Has he! I'le try his Spectacles. Fer. Ha! Roderigo there! the Scholler That went to Salamanca, takes be degrees I'th Schoole of Gipsies? let the fish alone, Give him Line, this is the Dove, the Dove: the Raven That Beldam mock'd me with. Lew. What Wormes pick you out there now? Al. Thisâwhen this Line the other crosses Art tells me 'tis a booke of losses, Bend your hand thus, Oh! here I finde You have lost a Ship in a great winde. Lew. Lying Rogue I ne're had any. Al. Harke, as I gather, That great Ship was de Castro call'd your Father. Lew. And I must hew that Rock that split him. Al. Nay and you threaten. Fra. And what's Don John thy fortune? th'art long fumbling at it? Jo. Shee tells me tales of the Moone sir. Pre. And now 'tis come to the Sun sir. Your Sun wud ride, the youth wud runne, The youth wud sayle, the youth wud flie; Hee's tying a knot will ne're be done, He shoots, and yet has ne're be done, You have two, 'twere good you lent him one, And a heart too, for he has none. Fra. Hoyday, lend one of mine eyes! San. They give us nothing, hee'd best put on a bold face and ask it. Song. Now that from the Hive You gather'd have the Honey, Our Bees but poorely thrive, Unlesse the Bankes be sunny. Then let your Sun and Moone Your gold and silver shine, My thanks shall humming fly to you. Omnes. And mine, and mine, and mine, Al. See, see, your Gipsie toyes, You mad Girles, you merry Boyes. A boone voyage we have made Loud Peales must then be had, If I a Gipsie be A crack rope I am for thee; Oh here's a Golden Ring, Such clappers please a King; Such clapers please a King: you pleas'd may pass away Then let your Bell ropes stay, Now chime 'tis Holy-day, Now chime 'tis Holy-day. Pre. No more of this pray Father, fall to your Dancing. Dance. Lew. Clara will come too late now. Fer. 'Tis great pitty, Besides your Songs, Dances and other Pastimes, You do not as our Spanish Actors doe, make triall of a Stage. Al. We are sir about it, So please your high authority to signe us Some warrant to confirme us. Fer. My hand shall doo'tâand bring the best in Spaine to see your Sports. Al. Which to set off this Gentleman a Scholler Ro. Pox on you. Al. Will write for us. Fer. A Spaniard sir? Ro. No my Lord an Italian. Fer. Denies his Country tooâmy Son sings Gipsie Ballads, Keepe as you are, wee'l see your Poets vaine, And yours for playing; time is not ill spent That's thus laid out in harmelesse merriment. Exit Gipsies Dancing. Pe. My Lord of Carcomo, for this entertainment, You shall command our loves. Fra. Y'are nobly welcome. Pe. The Evening growes upon us, Lords to all A happy time of day. Fer. The like to you Don Pedro. Lew. To my hearts sole Lady, Pray let my service humbly be remembred, We onely mist her presence. Ma. I shall truly Report your worthy love. Exit Ped. Ma. Fer. You shall no further, Indeed my Lords you shall not. Fra. With your favour Wee will attend you home. Enter Diego. Die. Where's Don Pedro? oh sir! Lew. Why what's the matter? Die. The Lady Clara, Passing neere to my Lord Corigidors house, Met with a strange mischance. Fer. How, what mischance? Die. The Jester that so late arrived at Court, And there was welcome for his Countries sake, By importunity of some friends, it seemes Had borrow'd from the Gentleman of your Horse, The backing of your mettl'd Barbary: On which being mounted, whil'st a number gaz'd To heare what Jests hee could performe on Horse back, The head strong beast unus'd to such a Rider, Beares the Presse of People before him; With which throng, the Lady Clara meeting, Fainted, and there fell down; not bruis'd I hope; But frighted and intranc'd. Lew. Ill destin'd mischiefe! Fer. Where have you left her? Die. At your house my Lord, A servant comming forth, and knowing who The Lady was, convey'd her to a Chamber, A Surgeon too is sent for. Fer. Had shee been my Daughter, My care could not be greater, then it shall be For her recure. Lew. But if shee miscarry, I am the most unhappy Man that lives. Exit. Fer. Diego Coast about the Fields, And over-take Don Pedro and his Wife, They newly parted from us. Die. I'le runne speedily. Exit. Fer. A strange mischance, but what! I have my Lord Francisco this day noted, I may tell you, an accident of merriment and wonder: Fra. Indeed my Lord. Fer. I have not thoughts enough About me to imagine what th'event Can come to, 'tis indeed about my Son; Hereafter you may counsell me. Fra. Most gladlyâhow fares the Lady? Enter Lewys. Lew. Call'd back to Life, but full of sadnesse. Fer. Talkes shee nothing? Lew. Nothing for when the women that attend on her Demanded how shee did, shee turn'd about, And answered with a sigh, when I came neere, And by the Love I bore her, begg'd a word Of hope to comfort mee in her well-doing; Before shee would reply, from her faire Eyes Shee greetes me with a Bracelet of her teares; Then wish'd me not to doubt, shee was too well, Entreates that shee may sleepe without disturbance, Or company untill her Father came. And thus I left her. Fra. For shee's past the worst, Young Maides are oft so troubled. Enter Pedro and Maria. Fer. Here come they You talke ofâsir, your Daughter for your comfort Is now upon amendment. Ma. Oh my Lord! You speake an Angels voyce. Fer. Pray in and visit her, Exit Ped. Ma. I'le follow instantlyâyou shall not part Without a cup of Wine my Lord. Fra. 'Tis now too troublesome a time; Which way take you Don Lewys? Lew. No matter which, for till I heare My Clara be recover'd I am nothing, My Lord Corigidor, I am your servant For this free entertainment. Fer. You have conquer'd me In noble courtesie. Lew. Oh! that no art But Love it selfe can cure a Love-sick heart. Exit. Clara in a Chaire, Pedro and Maria by her. Ma. Clara, hope of mine age! Ped. Soule of my comfort, Kill us not both at once; why dost thou speede Thine Eye in such a progresse 'bout these Walls? Cla. Yon large Window Yeilds some faire prospect, good my Lord looke out, And tell mee what you see there. Pe. Easie suite, Clara it over-viewes a spacious Garden, Amidst which stands an Alablaster Fountaine, A goodly one. Cla. Indeed my Lord. Ma. The griefes grow wide, And will mislead thy judgement through thy weakenesse If thou obey thy weakenesse. Cla. Who ownes these glorious buildings? Pe. Don Fernando De Azeutda, the Corigidor Of Mardrill, a true noble Gentleman. Cla. May I not see him? Ma. See him Clara, why? Cla. A truly noble Gentleman you said sir. Pe. I did: loe here he comes in person, We are my Lord your servants. Enter Fernando. Fer. Good no complement, Young Lady there attends below a Surgeon Of worthy fame and practice, is't your pleasure To be his Patient? Cla. With your favour sir, May I impart some few, but needefull words Of secresie to you, to you your selfe, None but your selfe. Fer. You may. Pe. Must I not heare 'em? Ma. Nor I. Cla. Oh yes, pray sit my Lord. Fer. Say on. Cla. You have been Married. Fer. To a Wife young Lady, Who whiles the Heavens did lend her me was fruitfull In all those vertues which stiles Woman good. Cla. And you had Children by her. Fer. Had 'tis true, Now have but one, a Son, and hee yet lives, The Daughter, as if in her Birth, the Mother Had perfected the errand shee was sent for Into the World, from that houre tooke her Life In which the other that gave it her, lost hers; Yet shortly shee unhappily, but fatally Perish'd at Sea. Cla. Sad story! Fer. Roderigo, My Sonne. Cla. How is hee call'd sir? Fer. Roderigo. Hee lives at Salamanca, and I feare That neither Time, Perswasions nor his Fortunes Can draw him thence. Cla. My Lord, d'ee know this Crucifix? Fer. You drive me to amazement, 'twas my Sonnes, A Legacy bequeathed him from his Mother Upon her Death-bed, deare to him as Life; On Earth there cannot be another treasure Hee values at like rate as hee does this. Cla. Oh then I am a cast-away! Ma. How's that? Pe. Alas shee will grow frantick. Cla. In my bosome, Next to my Heart my Lord I have laid up, In bloody Characters a Tale of horror, Pray read the Paper, and if there you finde Ought that concernes a Maide undone, and miserable Made so by one of yours, call back the piety Of nature, to the goodnesse of a Judge, An upright Judge, not of a partiall Father, For doe not wonder that I live to suffer Such a full weight of wrongs, but wonder rather That I have liv'd to speak them; thou great man Yet read, read on, and as thou read'st consider What I have suffer'd, what thou ought'st to doe; Thine owne Name, Father-hood, and my dishonour Be just as Heaven and fate are, that by miracle Have in my weakenesse wrought a strange discovery; Truth copied from my heart is texted there: Let now my shame be throughly understood, Sinnes are heard farthest, when they cry in blood. Fer. True, true, they doe not cry but hollow here, This is the Trumpet of a Soule drown'd deepe In the unfathom'd Seas of matchlesse sorrowes. I must lock fast the dore. Exit. Ma. I have no words To call for vengeance. Pe. I am lost in marvaile. Enter Fernando. Fer. Sir, pray sit as you sat before: white paper This should be innocence, these Letters Gules Should be the honest Oracles of Revenge. What's Beauty but a perfect white and red? Both here well mixt, limne truth so beautifull, That to distrust it as I am a Father; Speakes mee as foule, as rape hath spoken my Sonne, 'Tis true. Cla. 'Tis true. Fer. Then marke mee how I kneele Before the high tribunall of your Injuries; Thou too too much wrong'd Maid scorne not my teares, For these are teares of Rage, not teares of Love. Thou Father of this too too much wrong'd Maide, Thou Mother of her counsells and her cares; I doe not plead for pitty to a Villaine, Oh! let him die as hee hath liv'd dishonorably, Basely and cursedly, I plead for pitty, To my till now untainted blood and honour, Teach mee how I may now be just and cruell; For henceforth I am Childlesse. Cla. Pray sit rise, You wrong your place and age. Fer. Point mee my Grave In some obscure by-path, where never memory Nor mention of my Name may be found out. Cla. My Lord, I can weep with you, nay weepe for yee As you for mee, your passions are instructions, And prompt my faltering Tongue to beg at least A noble satisfaction, tho not revenge. Fer. Speak that agen. Cla. Can you procure no Balme To heale a wounded Name? Fer. Oh th'art as faire In Mercy as in Beauty, wilt thou live, And I'le be thy Physitian? Cla. I'le be yours. Fer. Don Pedro, wee'l to counsaile This Daughter shall be ours, sleepe, sleepe, young Angell, My care shall wake about thee. Cla. Heaven is gracious, And I am eas'd. Fer. Wee will be yet more private, Might curtaines o're the world, soft dreams rest with thee. The best revenge is to reforme our crymes, Then time crowns sorrowes, sorrowes sweeten times. Ex.</field>

Protest my Lordâ Fer. Nay, nay, shake off protesting, When I was young sir, I have plaid my selfe. San. Your selfe my Lord! you were but a poore Company then. Fer.

I'le goe then and bespeake an ocean of Sweete meates, Marmalad and Custards. Al. Make hast to know what you must doe. San. Doe I call for enough, and when my Belly is full, fill my Pockets. Soto. To a Banquet there must be Wine, Fortunes a scurvy Whore; if shee makes not my head sound like a Rattle; and my Heels dance the Canaries. Al. So, so, dispatch, whil'st me employ our braines To set things off toth' Life. Exit. Ro. I'le be streight with you, Why does my Father put this trick on mee? Spies hee mee through my Vizard? if hee does He's not the King of Spaine, and 'tis no Treason; If his invention, Jet upon a Stage Why should not I use action? a debosh'd fellow! A very rake-hell, this reflects on mee. And I'le retort it, grown a Poet Father? No matter in what straine your Play must runne, But I shall fit you for a roring Sonne. Exit. Florish.

Al. Not yet come home? before on this old Tree Shall grow a branch so blasted, I'le hew it off, And bury it at my foote, didst thou enquire At my Brothers? Soto. At your Sisters. Al. At my Wives Fathers? Soto. At your Uncles Mothers, no such sheepe has broke through their hedge, no such Calfe as your Sonne sucks, or bleates in their ground. Al. I am unblest to have but one Sonne onely. One staffe to beare my age upâone Taper left, To light me to my Grave, and that burnes dimly That leaves me darkling hid in clouds of woe, He that should prop me is mine overthrow. Fer. Well done old fellow is't not? Omnes. Yes, yes, my Lord. Enter Sancho. Soto. Here comes his man Hialdo. Al. Where's the prodigall your Master sirrah? San. Eating Acorns amongst Swine, draffe amongst Hoggs, and gnawing bones amongst Doggs; has lost all his Money at Dice, his Wits with his Money, and his honesty with both, for hee bum-fiddles me; makes the Drawers curvet, pitches the Plate over the Bar, scores up the Vintners Name in the Ram-head; flirts his Wife under the Nose, and bids you with a Pox send him more Money.

San. Not a Marvedi. Al. Thou shalt have none of me. Soto. Hold his Nose to the Grinstone my Lord. Ro. I shall have none! Al. Charge mee a case of Pistolls, What I have built I'le ruine, shall I suffer A Slave to set his Foote upon my heart? A Sonne! a barbarous Villaine, or if Heaven save thee Now from my Justice, yet my curse pursues thee. Ro. Hialdo, carbonado thou the old Rogue my Father. San. Whil'st you slice into Collups the rusty Gamon his man there. Ro. No Money! Can Tavernes stand without anon, anon?

Has shee a sweete Face, Cherry-Cheeke, Strawberry-lip, white-skin, dainty Eye, pretty Foote, delicate Legs? as there's a Girle now. Ant. It is a Creature both for Birth and fortunes, And for most excellent graces of the minde, Few like her are in Spaine. Ro. When shall I see her?ânow Father pray take your curse off. Al. I doe, the Lady Lives from Mardrill, very neere fourteene Leagues, But thou shalt see her Picture. Ro. That, that, most Ladies in these dayes are but very fine Pictures.

Shee's rich, nobly discended. Ro. Did ever Nobility looke so scurvilie? Al. I am sunk in fortunes, shee may raise us both. Ro. Sink, let her to her Granam; marry a VVitch! have you fetch'd a VVife for mee out of Lapland? an old Midwife in a velvet Hat, were a goddesse to this: that a red Lip! Pre. There's a red Nose. Ro. That a yellow haire. Eu. Why? her teeth may be yellow. Ro. Where's the full Eye? Chri. Shee has full blabber Cheekes. Al. Set up thy rest, her marriest thou or none. Ro. None then, were all the Water in the World one Sea, all Kingdomes one Mountaine. I would climbe on all foure, up to the top of that Hill, and head-long hurle my selfe into that abisse of waves e're I would touch the skin of such rough Haberdine, for the breath of her Picture stinkes hither. A noyse within. Enter Don John, Diego, Cardochia, Sancho, and Soto in a hurry. Fer. What tumult's this? San., Soto. Murder, murder, murder, one of our Gipsies is in danger of hanging, hanging! Ped.

Ped. Ruffians and Theeves, to prison with 'em all. Al. My Lord wee'l leave engagements, in Place and Money For all our safe forth-commings; punish not all For one's offence, wee'l prove ourselves no Theeves. San. Oh Soto! I make Buttons. Soto. Would I could make some, and leave this Trade. Fer. Iron him then, let the rest goe free, but stir not one foote Out of Madrill; bring you in your witnesse. Soto. Prick him with a Pinne, or pinch him by the Elbow; any thing. San. My Lord Don Pedro, I am your Ward, wee have spent a little Money to get a horrible deale of Wit, and now I am weary of it. Pe.

Fathers have Eagles Eyes. But pray sir why was this done? why when I thought you Fast lock'd in Salamanca, at your Study, Leap'd you into a Gipsie? Ro. Sir, with your pardon, I shall at fit time, to you shew cause for all: Fer. Meane time sir, you have got a Trade to live by, Best to turne Player, an excellent Ruffian! ha! But know sir, when I had found you out, I gave you This project of set purpose, 'tis all my selfe, What the old Gipsie spake must be my Language, Nothing are left me but my Offices, And thin-fac'd honours, and this very Creature By you so scorn'd, must raise me by your Marrying her. Ro. You would not build your glory on my ruines. Fer. The Rascall has bely'd the Lady, Shee is not halfe so bad, all's one, shee's rich. Ro. Oh! will you see the joyes of my full youth? To Dunghill muck, seeke out some wretches Daughter; Whose soule is lost for gold then? you are more noble Then t'have your Son, the top branch of your house Grow in a heape of rubbish; I must marry a thing, I shall be asham'd to owne, asham'd to bring her Before a Sun-beame. Fer. I cannot helpe it sir, resolve upon't, and doo't. Ro. And doo't and die. Is there no face in Spaine for you to pick out But one to fright mee? when you sat the Play here There was a beauty, to be Lord of which I would against an Army throw defiance. Fer. Shee! Alas. Ro. How! how! at every haire of her's There hangs a very Angel, this! I am ready To drop down looking at it: Sir I beseech you Bury mee in this Earth, on which I am humbled To beg your blessing on mee for a Gipsie, Rather thenâoh! I know not what to terme it. Pray what is that young pensive piece of beauty? Your voyce for her, I ey'd her all the scene. Fer. I saw you did. Ro. Me thought 'twas a sweete Creature. Fer. Well tho my present state stands now on Ice, I'le let it crack and fall, rather then bar thee Of thy content, this Lady shall goe by then. Ro. Hang let her there, or any where. Fer. That young Lannard, Whom you have such a minde to, if you can whistle her To come to Fist, make tryall, play the young Falconer, I will nor mar your marriage, nor yet make Beauty no wealth, wealth uglinesse, which you wil take. Ro. I thanke you sir, put on your Mask good Madam, The Sun will spoyle your Face else. Exit.</field>
