      <field name="fulltext">Humana ante oculos fÃ¦dÃ¨ cum vita jaceret In terris oppressa gravi sub religione. Lucret.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. BENSLEY. When first Columbus left the Spanish shore In western climes new regions to explore; Soon a new world, beyond the Atlantic main, Disclos'd the wonders of it's vast domain; A race of men unletter'd, and untaught, Strangers to science, yet with virtue fraught.â No school they had of philosophic pride, And simple reason was their only guide. That reason in the paths of nature trod, And worshipping the Sun, they meant a God; Free from the ills in polish'd life that spring, And gold with them was a neglected thing. But Europe's sons felt gold's resistless sway To the new hemisphere they bend their way; Through ev'ry region carry sword and fire, And bigot rage and avarice conspire. Zeal bore the cross and poniard in it's hand, And massacre unpeopled half the land. Yet to unhappy men, to heroes slain, The British muse denies her tragic strain. Dryden alone let fall the gen'rous tear, And bade on Albion's stage the Feather'd Chiefs appear. His voice suppress'd, no bard their fate has sung, Silent our scene, and mute each tuneful tongue; While Greece and Rome swell'd our theatric state, And only classic heroes could be great. This night our author, an advent'er grown, Dares trace the virtues of the Torrid Zone. If in his scenes well painted passion glow; If there you view the draught of human woe; Britons will mark, from fierce religious zeal, What dread calamities weak mortals feel; Will hear the Indianâtho' in error blind, Against the pow'r that would opinion bind, Assert the freedom of the human mind. Ye critics, to whom poets must be civil, As Indians worship, out of fear, the devil, Of mod'rate principles you'll own the merit, Nor hither bring a persecuting spirit. Let modes of wit some toleration share; Rome Kills for error;âBe it yours to spare.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Emira. Wearied at length by their own raging toil, Her spirits sink to rest: kind sleep affords The only boon the wretched mind can feel, A momentary respite from despair. Enter Zilia. Emira. Who's there?âThat look alarming!âZilia, say Wherefore this sudden haste?âHow fares it now With Orellana? Zilia. Still a calm repose Suspends the tumult of the mighty passions, That war within. Nature quite harrass'd down Repairs the waste of grief. Emira. But oh! too soon With keener sense to waken her again To the strong agonies that rend her soul. How wears the night?â Zilia. It verges to the dawn. Emira. Then 'tis th'accustom'd hour, the only hour Of all that circle time's diurnal round, When Orellana knows suspence from pain. Zilia. The sun that form'd her, lent his brightest rays, His purest elements of sacred fire.â Hence all the virtues that but dimly shine In breasts of common mould, in her sublim'd, Burn to a fierce extravagance of soul. Emira. Yet what avails the great indignant spirit, The gen'rous flame for Freedom and Peru? The fever of her mind too soon must end Her weary frame.âThe live-long day it rages, And each returning night,âwhen all things else Thro' wide creation's round feel wonted rest, She only wakes to misery:âForlorn she sits With streaming eyes, while unrelenting cares Waste all within; and ever and anon In short distracted dreams wild fancy acts New scenes of terror in her blasted mind. Enter Orellana. Orel. Horror! Protect me! Save me;âSeas of blood Run purple round the altarâ'tis my brotherâ Barbarian hold!âIt is Alzuma bleedsâ Inhuman murd'rers! Oh! [Faints. Emira. 'Tis ever thus:â Sad visionary terrors rack her brain,â Too wretched mourner, victim of despair!â Orel. Oh! 'tis too much, too much to sufferâZilia, Art thou there?âEver friendly, kind, and good!â Emira too!âwhy, sister virgins, why Must you still labour with my weight of woe? Emira. Attending thee we but obey the call Of duty and of love.âDispel thy fears, And hush this tumult of disorder'd fancy. Orel. Would heav'n I could!âBut these imaginings Were terrible indeed!âRound yonder couch Such horrid phantoms rose. Emira. Forget 'em allâ You've nothing now to fear.â Orel. Alas, the wretched Have ev'ry thing to fearâMethought Pizarro With fury dragg'd me to the altar's foot; There urg'd imperious to renounce my gods, And wed Don Carlos; with apostate zeal My mother join'd her aid;âconspir'd against me; When, oh! distracting sight! my brother, rushing To save a sister from the vile dishonour, Receiv'd Pizarro's dagger in his heart.â The altar smoak'd with gore;âthe cruel Spaniard Look'd a grim joy to see the only hope Of desolate Peru,âa Prince descended From a long race of Kings, ignobly fall, And welter in his blood before him. Emira. Yet, These are but fancied illsâAlzuma lives Safe in obscurity, far hence remote. Prostrate Peru may lift her head again, And heav'n restore a brother to your arms. Orel. Delusive thought! Yet let me fondly cherish The soothing flattery.âOh! Sister virgins, Should e'er the hero bless my longing eyes, I could embrace him with a sister's love, And in his sight forget my sorrows past. But oh! vain hope!âHe would not know me now Thus with'ring in my bloomâAs yet an infant I number'd scarce ten years, when hence he went To Chili's realms, ere the foe burst upon us,â To learn the course of ev'ry orb above, And all the myst'ries of his parent sun. Mean time the Spaniardâbut I'll not retrace That tale of horror.âSince that hour accurst, Ten times the sun hath made his annual circle, Nor yet Alzuma reigns!âAlas! my virgins, Distinction's lost amongst us, and the last Surviving Inca of undone Peru Sinks to a slave,âa wand'rer o'er the land!â Emira. Rekindle not the fury of your soulâ For lo! with purple light the orient morn Glows in yon Eastern clime!âDon Carlos soon, As is his wont, with early importunity Will press his ardent suit. Be timely cautious, Nor let him find pale grief and discontent For ever dwell in Orellana's breast.â 'Twill rouze the Spaniard's rageâa cloyster'd virgin With thee, I worship'd the eternal fire.â 'Tis friendship prompts, if I presume to wish You'd not provoke the foe. Orel. I know thy truth, Thy constancy approv'd;âand Carlos too I grant has qualities that claim respect. Emira. Tho' other gods he worship, yet in him Religion wears a gentler mien, nor serves To sanctify rapacity and murder.â 'Tis love perhaps,âfor sure he fondly lovesâ 'Tis love perhaps,ânot virtue,âthat allays His fiercer passions,âbut whate'er the cause, He is our shield from stern Pizarro's rage: To him unnumber'd millions lift their hands, And thank him with their tears for life preserv'd.â Orel. 'Tis true, Emiraâoft I've known him check The rage of wasting warâoft at his voice Ev'n Persecution rests upon her altar, Thirsting for blood in vain.âAnd yet this heart Was never form'd for himâyon radiant God, Tho' each revolving day he rise to view His once lov'd region, now a land of slaves, To see the Spaniard triumph in his guilt, Nor rolls th'avenging thunder o'er his head, Nor sends the rapid light'ning down to blast him, Tho' he disdain not still to shine alike On vice and suffering virtueâHa! no moreâ 'Twere impious madnessâthou creat'st us all, Thou glorious luminary!âThou the source Of light, and life, and universal good! From thee we issue, and to thee return! Thou mighty parent! (kneel down) Thou bright orbit, Thou Still inexhausted lead'st the radiant years, Thro' all creation pour'st thy golden flood, Thy vivid energyâwithout thee nought Or fair, or useful springsâto thee all nature Wafts up her orisons;âto thee I swear Whate'er shall prove the fate of Orellana, Thy sacred beams shall never,ânever see her Leagu'd with her country's foes; shall ne'er behold her A vile apostate from her holy vow.â Enter Ezmont. Emira. Ezmont, why sudden thusâand hark! unfoldâ [A flourish of trumpets. What means that musick, that triumphant joy? Ezmont. With early zeal Pizarro seeks the altar To celebrate his foreign rites.â Orell. And fire His unrelenting heart to new exploits. Ezmont. A captive band from various prisons led Walk in his train, and follow to the temple, There to abjure their country, and their gods, Or meet their instant doom.â Orel. And does my mother Attend the guilty pomp? Ezmont. She doesâwith her All their whole courtier-band attend Pizarro, All but Don Carlos;âwith a lover's speed This way he bends his steps;âmy swiftest zeal Could scarce outstrip him.â Orel. Leave me virgins, leave meâ Ezmont I thank thy care. (they go out.) Now summon all Thy calmest patience, and thy firm resolve. Enter Don Carlos. Carlos. Let this auspicious morn dispel thy cares, And each successive hour on balmy wings Bring peace, bring health, and beauty's roseate bloom;â Does Orellana shun me?âhither turn Thy gracious aspect; let those azure eyes Beam with their gentlest radiance.â Orel. Those eyes With galling tears have long since lost their lustreâ They, like the daughters of rapacious Spain, Have not yet learn'd to gild the cloud of woe, Inspire the look, and animate the glance, While misery lays desolate the heart. Carlos. Let love diffuse his cordial o'er thy spirits Soon shall each grace awaken, soon thy heart Beat sprightly notes of rapture and of joy. Orel. Oh! talk not, Carlos, to a wretch forlorn, And lost as I am,âdo not talk of joy. No more shall pleasure visit this sad form, This breathing statue of despair. Carlos. Despair But ill requites th'indulgent care of heav'n, That now invites thee to enjoy with me Your share of love, and empire.â Orel. Take again, Take back your vows of friendship and of love.â I do entreat you take 'emâbear 'em hence To the bright dames that grace your native landâ Worthier they'll listen to youâthey have hearts Prone to thy soft impressionsâthey have hearts That never bled to see the ruthless sword, Thy sword, Don Carlos, lay their country waste;â Thou hast not injur'd them;âbut oh! respect A captive wretch,âa wretch that has full cause, Yet pours no curses on thee!â Carlos. Wilt thou thus, Relentless fair! wilt thou then wound me thus With stern reproach?âUnder a father's banner I wag'd the war; and if her purple wing Propitious victory wav'd o'er my head, The world can witness, who by me have fall'n, All bravely fell in the embattled field, Not naked and disarm'dâIn me the vanquish'd Have found a friendâ'Twas Orellana's will.â Her conqu'ring eyes have half aveng'd her country, And made the victor beauty's willing slave. His laurels bloom for thee;âhe lays his trophies, His scepter at your feetâthy native realm Wooes thee to sov'reign sway, and bids thee rule The western world, when to her softer clime Spain shall invite thy mother.â Orel. Name her notâ I would not think upon her crimesâbecome The conqu'ror's wife,âoh! shameless guilt!âbecome The frantic votarist of Spanish gods, She fires his haughty soul to tenfold rage.â This day prepares new victimsâoh! my Lord, If your religion does not quite suppress The voice of nature, save the lives of wretches; Plead thou their cause;âlet me not see again The streaming blood of innocence. Carlos. I move By thy command alone; and oh! bright maid, The pity I extend, will surely claim The soft return of thine. Orell. Alas! My Lord, Much I esteem thy goodness; much I honour Thy many virtuesâbut a holy vow Forbids my love; and tell me, should I grant it, Would'st thou receive an interdicted wretch, With counterfeited smiles to thy embrace? Believe me, sir, who dares renounce her gods, Will dare be false to man. Enter Pizarro, Orazia, attendants, &amp;c. Pizarro. Come near my son, Thou seest thy father with assiduous care Spreading the glories of his king and God O'er this new world. Carlos. My father's fervent zeal Shall stand time honour'd in the rolls of fame. Vanquish'd Peru thro' all her cities mourns Thy vast renown in arms; it now were time That weary conquest should abate her rigours, And peace begin to harmonize the world.â Orazia. As yet, young warrior, our untutor'd race To thee is little knownâan Indian mind Is wrapp'd in errors mist's; from fabling priests Hears impious legends; in each falling show'r, Each cloud that sails upon yon azure deep, Conceives the present deity; in dreams, Which fever'd fancy forms, still thinks it hears Loud oracles, commercing with its gods. The DÃ¦mons and the human faculties Are then in dark conspiracy, and all Is bigot rage, and cruelty and horror.â This gloom must be dispell'd; and force, my son, 'Tis force must execute the holy work. Carlos. And think we then our duty unperform'd Unless we imitate with furious zeal Heav'n's vengeance, not it's mercy? Pizarro. Justice calls For vengeance on a blind offending world. I know my mission hereâbeneath the tropic The holy cross I've borne, and in that sign Pizarro still shall conquerâbe it mine To stretch the ray of truth, and bid the Indian Kneel and adore! Carlos. Almagro's conqu'ring arm In Chili's realm hath crush'd the savage war. The western world hath heard the hideous ruin, And suppliant courts the yoke. Pizarro. But still Alzuma Lives for new tumultâ Orazia. Lives to bid his mother With tears and burning blushes hear his name. Proud, uncontroulable, and fierce of spirit; Ev'n in his earliest youth, his boyish days, When the grim tiger from the thicket rush'd, Did he once fly?âDid he not ev'n then Dare the encounter?âthe fell monster gor'd His youthful breast, and if his father's arm Had not transfix'd the savage to the earth, Alzuma then had died.âSince that he bore The tiger's mark, and ere the down of manhood Sprung on his cheek, went from his mother far; Grew up implacable of soul, and now With dire alarms shakes all the Western World. Carlos. And if our crimes provokeâ Pizarro. Our crimes, my son! Orazia. That thought to Orellana owes its birth; In soft captivity she holds him bound; Her beauty leads him with a single glance, Moves with a sigh and softens with a tear, And love and grace by turns dispute his heart. Pizarro, Hear Orellanaâsay, thou beauteous mourner, How long shall tears and slow consuming grief Deform thy native graces? Orel. Pardon, Sir, If the rough manners of my native clime Form'd me in plain simplicityâunskill'd In all the studied elegance of feature, I only know to look my honest meaning; An artless savage, a forsaken wretch, Whom joy has long forsworn!â Orazia. In Cusco's court, Where ev'ry face but thine is deck'd with smiles, Such persevering sorrow ill befits Orazia's daughterâwhile your mother still Ev'n with the victor shares her ancient sceptre, You have full cause of joy.âAnd tell me, does not That gen'rous youth, Pizarro's gallant son, Breathe gentlest vows, and languish for your love? Orel. Ay, Madam!âLove and tenderness he brings, But sighs and tears are all I have to give.â Orazia. Away with vain excuseâthou trifler hear; Spain's pure religion callsâthis moment yield, And rank thee with the faithful.â Orel. That commandâ Orazia. Must be obey'd. Orel. Alas! full well you know Force has already dragg'd me to your altar;â There while the censer wreath'd its fragrant clouds, While pealing organs swell'd the solemn note, And through deep lengthen'd isles consenting choirs Harmonious hymn'd their god,ânot to your heav'n My pray'rs were offer'dâNo! ye holy pow'rs Whom long Peru hath worshipp'd,âin that hour You rush'd between me and their Christian pomp, Bore my rapt soul to your own orbs on high; And shrines, and burning lamps, grew dim before me. Enter Gonzalez. Orazia. Invincible in ignorance. Gonzalez. My Lord,â The slaves remain obdurate. Pizarro. Ha! reject The terms of proffer'd life! Gonzalez. Their eyes intent Gaze on two leaders, from whose fierce demeanour They gain new courage, obstinate in guilt. Their chiefs, by my command, attend your presence.â Enter Alzuma, and Ozmar. Pizarro. Say, what art thou, who with indignant spirit Has dar'd to mock our laws? Alzuma. One born in freedom! One, who while yet he lives, like freedom's son Will dare to think.â Pizarro. Reflect, rash youth, and take New life fr?m this auspicious day. Alzuma. The day, That sees a man crouch in ignoble bondage, Sees ev'ry virtue lost.â Pizarro. Beware, thou slave! Know'st thou that instant death awaits you both? Alzuma. We know itâwe expect itâwe invoke itâ 'Twill end our misery. Pizarro. Thou insolent!â All gracious heav'n, that still delights in mercyâ Alzuma. Mercy!âdelights in mercy! Pizarro. Yes;âhis word Gives life and peace to allâ Alzuma. And darest thou then, Thou fell destroyer!âRavager of earth! And dar'st thou then in horrid contrast stand To infinite benevolence?â Pizarro. No more I'll parley with obdurate guiltâGonzalez, Guard thou those miscreants; see they suffer death, And by their torments warn an impious race.â [Exit with Orazia, and attendants. Orel. Oh! Carlosâgen'rous youth! If any spark Of love dwell in thy nature, quickly fly, Pursue your cruel father, haste, prevent. The horrid murderâwhat have they committed? What is their crime?âOh! do not see them bleed, For daring to be true to heav'n. Carlos. I go, Thou gen'rous maid, to execute your will. [Exit. Orel. Or gain their liberty, or else the hour That sees 'em fall, will end this wretched being. (Exit after Carlos. Alzuma. And are there feelings here for human woe? Gon. Guards, lead your pris'ners hence. Alzuma. Spaniard a word.â Wilt thou indulge one moment to the wretched?â I thank theeâOzmar, we have walk'd together The rugged paths of honour;âto the last Grappled with fate,âagainst the foe have strain'd Bold virtue's nerve;âOh! let it never slacken, But bear us strongly up like men, who boast Souls ever prompt for liberty or death. Ozmar. Sunk as we are, our country bleeding round us, Our cities sack't, our very gods dishonour'd, Death is relief, is victory and triumph.â Alzuma. But let us entertain our doom, my friend, In silent dignity:âAmidst our pangs Let no dejected passion tell the Spaniard, Alzuma dies in me!â Ozmar. Not all the tortures Their vengeance can inflict, shall e'er extort One secret from me. Alzuma. Let him shudder still With dire conceptions at Alzuma's name; Still let him think Alzuma roams the forest, Climbs the steep mountain's brow, or down the lake Glides in the swift canoe to rouze the war, And call the nations to a great revenge. Let that pursue him stillâOh! let that thought, And the dire furies of detested guilt With ceaseless pangs inhabit in his heart. Alzuma dies content!â Ozmar. The tyrant's pow'r Is short liv'd o'er us, and his murd'rous rage But sets the hero free.â Alzuma. His pow'r may shackle These mortal limbs; but the unbodied spirit Shall bear its native liberty along, To the bless'd vale behind the cloud capt hill, The silent region of departed souls, That region undiscover'd by the Spaniard!â Where our forefathers in unfading bliss, Prepare the roseate bow'r, and weave the chaplet, For deeds heroic done in life; for all, Who firm in honour, by distress unconquer'd, Have smil'd in woe, and to their graves have carried The sacred charter of the free born mind.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene at the Gate of the Church, or Temple of the Sun. Enter Alzuma. Dost thou not hear me, lost Peru?âNot hear The clank of these vile chains that fetter thus Your rightful sov'reign?âWherefore thus again Led to their Christian temple?âWhy their guards Plac'd at each pass?âIs this, just gods, a lot For your own progeny?âYet even here, Here still is room for fortitude and honour. Yes, ye calamities of this bad world, Pour all your destin'd malice on my head! Ye storms, ye tempests roar! Each change of fortune Is but a change of virtue.â Enter Ozmar. Alzuma. Valiant Ozmar, Let me embrace theeâOzmar, spite of all My heart's best firmness, it drops blood for thee. Ozmar. Alzuma! Tears!âAnd dost thou think me then So poor of soul?â Aluuma. Ozmar, I will not weep. I will not stain a righteous cause with tears.â And yet frail nature thus will gush it's way. Oh! there's a cause that consecrates each drop That burns it's channel down the soldier's cheek! Ozmar, to see a nation bleeding round us, Yet fetter'd thus in chainsâI cannot speakâ Thy own great heart will tell thee.â Ozmar. Gen'rous Prince! Embitter not the cup of woe.â Alzuma. To die Inglorious! Unreveng'd!âMy father's death, Thy savage massacre, lamented shade! Oh! Atabalipa, yet unatton'd! His queen Orazia, my much honour'd mother, How has fate dealt with her?âMy sister too, Poor Orellana!â'Tis a long, long time Since last these eyes beheld her.âBreathes she still The vital air?âAnd oh! what happy clime Affords her innocence and truth a shelter? Alzuma knows not, and that piercing thought Unmans my soul, and gives a sting to death. Ozmar. The holy pow'rs, who watch o'er innocenceâ Alzuma. No pow'rs protect it now.âWhere were ye, gods, In that black period when the Spanish spoiler First spoke in thunder to us?âNot your own Thrice honour'd temples then contain'd ye!âNo! Your sacred temples, and your holy altars You left defenceless.âYou have lost your rites, Your kings their empire, and Peru her freedom. Ozmar. If deeds heroic could have sav'd the state Thy own great patriot toilâ Alzuma. Where were ye, gods, When late in Chili's wide extended plains I sought the embattled foe?âFrom ev'ry quarter I brought the western world in arms.âThe sun Beneath the burning line beheld my course, Back to the Tropic saw my rapid march;â The queen of night and ev'ry vivid planet Walking in brightness their empyreal round Saw my unwearied labourâsaw me guide Down the broad Amazon my rapid bark, Each island visiting; on ev'ry shore Invoking vengeance; heav'n beheld it all, Yet left me in th'extreme, to hostile gods, Th'unjust, revengeful, cruel gods of Spain, Betray'd a faithful unsuspecting race.â Ozmar. Yes, all, all's lost, all ruin'd!âThat last battle Has giv'n 'em up the worldâAlmagro's arms Heap'd hideous ruin on usâ Alzuma. Ozmar there, There liberty amidst that purple heap Her gen'rous bosom, grac'd with honest scars, Groan'd and expir'd.âOh! City of the Sun, Ye sacred ashes of my friends, who perish'd In your lov'd country's last expiring blaze! Oh! seat of empire!âWitness in your fall I have dar'd nobly for you. Enter Gonzalez and Guards. Gon. Be those chains Instant releas'd, and set the pris'ners free. [Soldiers unchain them. Alzuma. Ah! that soft virgin form appears again! This way she bends her steps.âWhat may this mean? Enter Orellana. Orel. There is your warrant, Sir,âPizarro's hand Hath sign'd their freedom! Gon. I obey the mandate. [Exit with soldiers. Alzuma. Tell me, thou fair unknown! To what new scenes Our fate reserves us both?â Orel. Humanity And justice plead your cause. Alzuma. And does thy heart Feel the soft touch of nature for the wretched? Orel. Stranger, my heart is feelingly alive When misery claims a tearâthat fruitless tribute Is all I can, and heav'n demands it of me. Alzuma. I pray ye mock me notâa Spaniard's heav'n Inspires revenge, and cruelty and murder. Orel. In me you see a daughter of Peru, And nature and religion bind me to you. Alzuma. Then our own gods watch o'er affliction still, And at their hands I do accept my life. Oh! Gen'rous virgin, I respect thy virtuesâ The pow'rs that gave them, will reward them tooâ If not, in ev'ry state, in death or conquest, They are their own sweet recompence. Orel. That mien! That prompt heroic ardor!âStranger, say Whence and what art thou?â Alzuma. By my birth obscure:â Almagro late beheld me grasp the javelin, And 'midst the gen'ral carnage of that day, Seek death in vain thro' all the paths of war. Orel. Ah! tell me then?âI tremble while I askâ Where is Alzuma?âLives he.âDoes he yet Elude the tyrant's search?âOr has he sought The vale of fleeting spirits?âQuickly tell me, For oh! I long to hearâ Alzuma. Support me, Ozmarâ Her tender sympathyâ Ozmar. Now summon all Your manly firmness.âshe's a stranger yetâ Let prudence guard theeâ Orel. Ah! distract me notâ Why art thou pale!âWhy gath'ring in thy eye Stand those round drops?âAlas! he is no moreâ Ozmar. Alzuma lives! Orel. Lives! Ozmar. But far hence remote Seeks a retreat for misery and freedomâ Orel. Then am I bless'd indeed!â Alzuma. Absorb'd in wonder, My flutt'ring soul feels all her functions lost. Orel. Weep'st thou, brave youth?âAh! Say what hidden causeâ Alzuma. Thy gen'rous tenderness.âLike you I'm born With too much sensibility of heart. Orel. Indeed you seem to bear a noble natureâ Say will you undertake like men, and dare A hardy enterprize, that tends at once To your own safety and the general weal? Alzuma. Speak thy intent.âEv'n ruin'd as we are We boast the virtue still to serve thy cause. Orel. Then mark my wordsâanon, when in the palace, All court the Spaniard's smiles, and do the work Of low ambition, then with cautious step Repair ye both to yonder sacred temple, In happier days the temple of the Sun! Now other worship, other rites prevail.â Employ'd in secret duty there you'll find me. Enter Gonzalez. Orel. What would Gonzalez?â Gon. With determin'd haste The empress seeks you.â Orel. Lead your captives forth.â [They bow and are going out. Enter Orazia. Orazia. These are the insolents whom thy entreaty Has sav'd from justice. Orel. To Don Carlos' goodness I bow in gratitude.â Orazia. Take heed, rash men, Or vengeance waits youâ (they go out.) Orellana hear. Don Carlos Ianguishes with gentlest passion, And wooes you to his arms.âA mother's voice Commands thee to abjure fictitious gods, And make thee lineal to our ancient sceptre.â Orel. What, while my brother lives!â Orazia. Pizarro sees, At length with indignation sees his slave Suspend the progress of our righteous faith. Orel. His slave!âA robber's slave!âIs that befitting? Is that my mother?âThese are virtue's tearsâ They mean you no offence.â Orazia. Ungrateful child! Still with incessant rage to steel your heart, Against a victor, whom high Heav'n approves, Against a mother, who would save you still. Orel. The tyrant has my cursesâI avow itâ My bitterest imprecations on him!âBut A mother claims respectâThen hear my pray'râ Let not your Christian worship, while it gives New modes of faithâOh! let it ne'er efface The virtues of humanityâ [Exit. Orazia. Oh! blind, And fatal superstition!âfix'd in error, Alas! she sees not that by heav'n commission'd To chase credulity Pizzaro came, And reigns by right divine o'er ev'ry heart. Oh! happy state! Christian Orazia now Glows for the honour of eternal truth,â To that bows rev'rent down, and joys to see Awful religion bear the sword of justice. [Exit. Scene the Temple of the Sun. Enter Alzuma and Ozmar. Alzuma. Tread you not, Ozmar, with a solemn fear This hallow'd pavement? Ozmar. As I trace thy steps, A thousand mix'd emotions heave within me. Alzuma. Thou sacred dome! Thou venerable pile! Where erst the pious daughters of the Sun In meditation dwelt, and sacred song! No more for you those ritesâno more you'll hear Their pious vows, and their melodious strains. The Spanish robber violates your altars, And foreign gods possess you.â Ozmar. Yet, Alzuma, Who knows what that bright maid.â Alzuma. Some deep intent Rolls in her bosomâhark!âa feeble sound Comes slowly winding thro' yon lengthen'd isle [Musick is heard at a distance It gains upon the earâand lo! a train Of supplicating nymphsâye host of heav'n! Our own solemnities! how my heart glows With pious ardour! Let us hence, my friend, Lest we intrude upon their virgin choir. [They retire. Enter Orellana, Emira, Zilia, and other Virgins. An Image of the Sun, the Moon, &amp;c. in their Hands, a Censer of Fire, and some strewing Flowers. ODE. I. Bright orb, that rul'st th'Ã¦therial way, And pour'st the radiant flood of day; Thou sister regent of the night, Who shed'st o'er all thy sober light; Ye stars, that gleam from pole to pole; Ye thunders o'er our heads that roll; Ye lightnings, rains, ye storms on high, That speak the present deity: Hear your own servants; hear our virgin throng; Oh! save Alzumaâhear our mystic song. II. Ye band of venerable just, Ye warriors long since laid in dust; Whether in silent groves ye stray, Glow in the stars or solar way; Assemble all ye mighty dead, And stalk around the Spaniard's bed; In his fell heart with dismal yell Awaken all the fiends of hell; Assist Alzuma; arm each honest hand, And tear a guilty tyrant from the land. [They go out in procession. Enter Alzuma and Ozmar. Alzuma. For me their vows ascend!âthe pious train Warble their orizons for lost Alzuma!â Oh! Ozmar, Oh! my friend!âthe melting notes With thoughts that burn expand my glowing soul. Ha! that sweet maid approaches!â Enter Orellana. Ozmar. Now be hush'd Each sudden transportâto disclose thy name. Might fatal prove. Orellana coming forward. Alas! my spirits sinkâ Cold tremors shake my frame.â Alzuma. Your pardon, virgin, That thus encroaching on the hallow'd hourâ Orel. Strangers! you're welcome bothâthe wretched ever Bear their own passport to meâtrain'd myself In sad affliction's school, and wanting much Some charitable aid, these hands are ready To wipe the tear from the pale cheek of care.â Alzuma. Alas! misfortune, as we rise to life, Prepares her chalice for each human lip: We all are doom'd to weep.â Orel. Ye gen'rous youths, I see you both are apt to melt at woe.â I will not trouble youâ Alzuma. If there is aught May serve you, virgin, trust your faithful slavesâ These tears but strengthen virtueâspeak thy will. Orel. There is a business lab'ring in my heart That calls for firmest vigour.â Alzuma. If to drench A dagger's point in the fell Spaniard's bloodâ Orel. It wants no bloodshedâtell me will you serve me?â Alzuma. By heav'n I willâ Orel. Say will you traverse o'er The forests wild and continents of sand, To bear a message to a much lov'd brother, On whose dear life my happiness is grafted? Alzuma. Direct our courseâwe'll seek him straight.â Orel. Alas! Banished far hence, dear youth! He little thinks How here I drag the Spaniard's galling chain, And neither live nor die.âBut here I've form'd In braided colours the sad tale of woeâ [Takes out a braid of colours. He knows not letters, which th'inventive Spaniard Has hither broughtâBut this will tell him allâ This will instruct him to avoid this placeâ Let me be wretched, I'll endure it allâ But bless him godsâwatch over all his waysâ My woes must end me soon.â Alzuma. No, thou shalt join Our flightâwe'll bear thee to himâ Orel. Weak of limb My strength would fail meâwilt thou give him this? Alzuma. I willâby every Pow'r above, I will. Orel. Then take it, youth, and bear it to Alzuma.â Alzuma. Alzuma!â Orel. Yes; to him.â Alzuma. Ye gracious powers! And bear it to Alzuma!âOrellana! Orel. Those trembling accents! Oh! the various meanings Of ev'ry featureâAh! that look of thineâ, Alzuma. I am, I am, AlzumaâOh! my sister! I, I am heâthis fond embrace attests it. She faintsâshe faintsâOh! couldst thou e'er have hop'd it? 'Tis Orellana!â'tis, it is my sister. Orel. That air! that face! just so my father look'd!â I scarce can think it yetâthou art notâtell meâ Say art thou he?âPeru's surviving heirâ Art thou Alzuma?âdoes thy breast retain The tiger's fang? Alzuma. It does, it doesâ Orel. Have I so long Forbore to wander o'er him with my kisses?â To clasp thee close, and own thee with my tears?â [Embraces him. Alzuma. Grow to thy brother's heart, thou virtuous maid!â Ozmar, the Gods are hereâthey have not yet Deserted innocence.âThou watch, my friend, That none intrude upon this hour of joy.â [Exit. Ozmar. Orel. Why didst thou venture here? to this dire place? Oh! quickly flyâof all the Sun beheld In his own city, by immortals rais'd, This temple only stands.â Alzuma. Where is Orazia?â Orel. She lives. Alzuma. Then to her honour and her gods She still lives trueâI know her virtue well.â Orel. This side the grave no mortal virtue's known;â She's married to Pizarro. Alzuma. Married to him!â False to her faith, and married to Pizarro!â Orel. She shares his tyrant sceptre.â Alzuma. Oh! may heav'nâ Yet she's my mother stillâforgive her gods! If your dread sway can bear such crimes, forgive her, And keep your red'ning vengeance for the Spaniardâ Say shall I see Orazia?â Orel. At yon portal You met her dreadful frown. Alzuma. Was that my mother?â Unnatural woman! Orel. In her ruin'd mind Sits blind enthusiasm with'ring ev'ry virtue. Zeal forges setters for a free-born race, And murder's blade gleams in religion's hand. Alzuma. Bright orb! thou hear'st itâI make no appeal To you against herâbut to find thee thus, Thou best of sistersâ'midst a mother's crimes That rend my soulâit mixes tend'rest joy, And makes these tears a transport. Tell thy brother, What force upheld thee?âhow hast thou sustain'd Thy faith inviolate?â Orel. The Spaniard's rage Lists ev'ry passion on the side of virtue. Thou wer't far hence, know'st not the horrid night, That heav'd this mighty empire from its base. Alzuma. Ev'n now I shudder for thee! Orell. Cloyster'd here Two hundred chosen virgins of the Sun, Here in this very temple pour'd their praise In midnight harmony to ev'ry god, And bore thro' glimm'ring isles th'eternal fire; When the foe rush'd upon us; burst the sanctuary Which since the world's foundation 'till that hour Man never dar'd profaneâwith virgin shrieks, And female lamentation rung the dome; Devouring rage, and pale dismay, and death Ran wild in horrid forms; the crimson pavement Floated with gore;âno check their fury felt, 'Till weary slaughter stopt at last for breath, And spar'd a wretched few. Alzuma. Thou virtuous maid! What pitying God preserv'd thee? Orel. 'Twas in wrath,â In vengeance I was sav'dâto greater ills Alas! reserv'd!âto see my father murder'dâ Alzuma. Oh!âblessed be his shade!â Orel. E'er since Pizarro Urges to change my gods, and join his son In impious wedlockâ Alzuma. May his soul be plung'd In ever burning floods of liquid gold, And be his avarice the fiend that damns him! [Music heard. Orel. End we our conf'rence hereâthe virgin band Wait my returnâI would not have thee knownâ Retire my brotherâ Alzuma. And must we part so soon? Orel. Alas! too sure we mustâa faithful friend Shall lead thee to the grove where oft I walk In bitterness of soul. Alzuma. Yet e'er you goâ Here kneel, and swear by all the holy pow'rs Whom with firm constancy Peru adores, By the dear shades of long departed heroes, Whom av'rice slaughter'd, or religion stabb'd, Swear here, by all those great, those awful sanctions, Thou never wilt betray thy plighted vows. Orel. Yes, Orellana ratifies the oath! Alzuma. Now once again come to this fond embrace. We'll meet anonâ Orel. We shallâ Alzuma. Farewell, farewell! [She goes out. Protect, ye pow'rs, that struggling innocence. In your own holy cause she suffers all. Are ye no more the gods of peace?âNo more Affliction's friends?âIf that excelling goodness, If she is wretched thusâyet let me not Like the base Christian foe, with pious rage Who deals destruction round, and deems his murder Grateful on highâOh! let me not like him With horrid attributes affront my God! Yes, Heav'n is bounteous stillâye gracious pow'rs! Of you and your just ways I'll not complain. You've made us virtuous, and have done enough!â End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene the Temple. Enter Carlos and Gonzalez. Car. Thou hast my thanks, Gonzalezâmy fond heart But for thy watchful care had been the sport Of a fierce savage beauty.âNow I know The minion of her soul:âOh! that reflection Shoots all the fires of disappointed love Thro' my distracted heart. Gon. Forgive, my lord, If I unwittingly have fix'd a pang That preys upon your peace.âIn yonder grove I saw them meet in secret interview.â Car. I saw them tooâthy vigilance inform'd meâ These eyes beheld them in close amorous parley, In ardent gazeâBeheld a peasant slave Familiar with that luxury of charms, With Orellana's charms! It fires to madness. I saw that wretch whom I redeem'd from death, At her request redeem'dâUnthinking fool! I saw him meet her in the conscious grove, Embracing and embrac'd! Gon. Perish the thought, That thus disturbs your breastâyou know my lord, By your command I seiz'd the slave, and now Far other chains than those of love infold him. Car. E'er long he diesâthis very hour shall see him A Christian, or a victim to his errors.â Gon. The guards now lead him forthâ Car. Was it for this The tyrant fair oppos'd ev'n heav'n itself? Oh! at the altar's foot her lov'd idea Was present still, and zeal for heav'nly truth A tear from those bright eyes dissolv'd away;â But false compassion rules my heart no more. I saw her meet the slaveâat my approach Fierce indignation darted from her eye, And straight she turn'd with high disdain away. Ah!âSee! She comes!âStill lovely in her guilt! [Exit Gonzalez. The haughty fierceness of untutor'd virtue Beams savage graces round her; still she must, She shall be mine; my heart adores her still. Enter Orellana. Orel. You have done this, Sir,âand I thank you for itâ Car. Think not I urg'd severity against theeâ But oh! do justice to that gentle nature That governs here; that now throbs wildly for you, With all the soft solicitude of love. Orel. What has a wretch like me to do with love? Car. Dost thou avoid me then, thou cruel fair? Dost thou avoid me?âNow I know the cause That made thee unrelenting to my sighsâ I know your Paramourânow know for whom Don Carlos' vows were all dispers'd in air; For years who held dominion o'er your heart, And made me languish at your feet in vain. Orel. And if I cherish'd a long hidden flame, Who claims a right to tyrannize my heart? Car. Think'st thou a breast susceptible as mine, That swells with rapture if thou deign'st to smile, Or by a frown is tortur'd in the extreme, Think'st thou a heart like mine will e'er permit A conquer'd slave to win thy last regard? Oh! there's an avarice in love that claims Each gentle grace, each amiable air, Claims the noble hoard of sweets, and will not bear A word, a look directed to another.â Orel. And mean'st thou then to choak the voice of pity? Is that the purpose?âKnow the injur'd youth, Whom thy fell rage but now has doom'd to death, Is miserableâtherefore dear to me;â Know he is virtuousâtherefore has my love. Car. Thy love!âDoes he possess it?âHe, Inhuman fair!âBut yet recall the wordâ Our laws that spare no infidelâ Orel. Thou Spaniard! Thou fierce barbarian from a world unknown!â But all our sacred rites thou hast profan'd, And well may'st violate love's altar too. Come, point thy dagger at this virgin breast, And conquer hearts, as you would force our faith. Car. You wrong me much; hear Orellana, hear Thy tenderest suppliant. Orel. Neverâwoman's weakness With pity saw you kneeling at my feet, And sighing fruitless vows.âBut this last outrage Against a helpless captiveâWitness gods! If Orellana hear this Spaniard more, Or listen to the tale of impious love, Deep down in earth may she alive be buried, Her spirit doom'd to wander o'er the world, And never reach the mansion of her fathers.â Car. Your minion diesâmy rage is up in arms, And the soft voice of love shall plead no more. (Exit. Orel. Barbarian go!âAh! there's a sight indeed Afresh that opens ev'ry source of grief. Enter Alzuma in chains. Orel. Oh! Let me seek thy mother, tell her all; With the strong eloquence of filial tears, I'll throw me at her feet, and in her heart, Lost as it is, I'll find some hidden fibre, Where all the mother trembles for her offspring.â Alzuma. Restrain this rageâAlzuma would not owe A second favour to herâShe, alas! Is dead to natureâThat accursed fiend, Fanatic fury, blasts each moral virtue.â She has pronounc'd my doom.âLet her not know She kills a sonâOh! let me never add That guilt atrocious to a parent's crimes. Orel. Are there no means to save thee?â Alzuma. Look not thusâ Ennobled by thy virtuesâby distress Endear'd:âEach glance thou send'st unmans me quite, And ev'n a brother's fondness akes to view thee. Thy goodness charms, and by each heart-string draws me Back to this hated world.âFor thee, my sister, When I should boldly tread the ridge of peril, And dare the depth belowâfor thy dear sake I cling to lifeâextend my feeble arms, But thou no aid can'st give.â Orel. Distracting thought! Must I survive thee helpless and forlorn, A victim to the Spaniard's hated love? Alzuma. There lies the pang that bids these drops of anguish Fall in this copious streamânot for myself I feelâBut oh! when I am goneâwhen fate Has stretch'd this body on the flinty earth, Who shall defend thy weakness?âMust I leave thee A prey to ruffian force?âMust that rare beauty, Shall that conspire against thee? must those eyes Obedient roll to a fierce conqu'ror's will, Inflame his hot desires, to plunge thee deeper In shame and servitude? Orel. Unpitying gods! Alzuma. Perhaps to waft thee from thy native land To foreign altars, and a foreign bed!â Orel. There is but one, one only refugeâ Alzuma. Name itâ Orel. I'll perish with theeâLo! Behold a weapon! [Shews a dagger. Alzuma. Ha! Orel. Where'er thy spirit wings it's happy flight, I'll hail thy triumphâSoar on trembling wing, And distant eye thy radiant tract of glory To ev'ry kindred star.â Alzuma. Relentless pow'rs! No other boon you've left me to bestow. Orel. Ah! me! they comeâthe fell Pizarro comes.â Enter Pizarro, Orazia, Carlos, Guards, &amp;c. Ora. Now, Orellana, we demand compliance.â Provoke our wrath no moreâthe vested priest Waits at the altar; there Don Carlos' love And heav'n indulgent claim thee for their own. Alzuma. Unnatural, barbarous mother! [Aside. Orel. For his love Don Carlos has my thanksâSpain will not think Her lustre tarnish'd, that a wretch like me Feels no ambition for her proud alliance. The gods of Spainâ Ora. This arroganceâ Orel. Indulge A favourable earâthe Gods of Spain Will not be jealous that no fragrance rolls Around their shrines from meâIf error's maze Misguide my steps, their all pervading eye Will read the honest purpose of my soul, And mercy win the thunder from their hands. Ora. This wilful disobedience!âWho has taught The vain delusive dream?â Car. That slave!â'Tis he, Who rules her wayward fancy.â Ora. Ha!âThat traitor! Dost thou presume to spread sedition here? Alzuma. (Looking at her.) Oh! Thou apostate!âThese hot burning tears Will burst their wayâ Pizarro. And does thy sullen eye Dart the fierce glance of treason on your queen? Ora. Who and what art thou? Alzuma. I've no rank or name, To plead my cause in thy obdurate heart. To your own child unnatural as thou art, I have no claim to mercyâ Pizarro. Base reviler! Within the tropic all must think alike. Alzuma. Betwixt us both the sacred shaft of war Has long been shot, and enmity prevails Fierce, inextinguishable! Ora. My example May teach thee, slave, to yield to sacred truth, And Spain's imperial mandate. Alzuma. Thy example! Full well you judg'd, thou traitress to thy country!â To fly to gods who can forgive thy crimesâ Ours shudder at them.â Pizarro. To the altar drag The impious slaveâ [Guards seize Alzuma. Orel. Oh! Wretched Orellana! Alzuma. Barbarians hold! Yet Spaniard ere I die Hear my last fervent prayer.â'Twas lust of gold, Not zeal for truth and love of human kind, That brought you to Peru.âAnd may that gold, Oh! may it prove to Spain the direful spring Of worse calamities than we have felt; May it unnerve your arm; dissolve in sloth Laborious industry;âne'er let your plains The toiling hand of cultivation know; Kindle fierce war; and may some happier state, Whose sons with love of gen'rous freedom glowing Preserve their civil and religious rites, The foes of tyranny!âwho found their laws On the broad base of reason and of nature; Oh! may that happy state, if such there be!â With bolder prow triumphant o'er the deep, Pursue you hither with avenging thunder, In your own harbours wrap your ships in fire, And bow ye down to seek detected gold For others uses!âBe that curse upon ye! Pizarro. His blasphemy pollutes the airâforthwith Give him the death he merits.â Orel. Once again Let me embrace him.âOne last sad farewell No pow'r on earth shall hinder. [Embraces him. Car. Ha! that insolent! Perdition seize the slave!âShall he enjoyâ By heav'n this sabre cleaves him to the ground. [Going to strike. Orel. Now by the vital airâby ev'ry pow'r That guides, impels, or melts the human heart, By yon bright orb of day, by your own gods, Enough of blood they've hadâBy them I askâ They will approve soft pityâSpare his life, Oh! Spare his innocence, nor murder me. Car. Tear off her holdâBy heav'n the slaveâ Orel. Now strike, Now execute your purposeâwith the blow This ready dagger plunges to my heart. Car. Hold, Orellana!âThis abhorred steel [Takes the dagger from her. Was never meant to wound thy tender formâ Thou hast disarm'd my vengeanceâBy yon heav'n I would not see thy beauteous bosom gor'd For the extended empire of the world.â Orel. If ought of cruelty the pris'oner suffer, This hand shall set me free.â Car. Dispel thy fearsâ I will not urge his fateâI will not urge Thee to complianceâGuiltless of his death I leave this temple, leave this scene of horror Where persecution draws th'unhallow'd sword, And murders for belief. Pizarro. Yet Carlos stay, I charge thee stay, nor dare again traduce A father's deeds. Car. Your pardon, Sir; my heart revolts, And will not see that youth, whoe'er he be, A victim to the blind insensate rage That sheds man's blood, and dares to think it virtue. [Exit. Pizarro. Ha! The time calls for rigour; feeble laws And government relax'd might hazard all The laurels this good sword has reap'd in war. Rash and presumptuous boy!âBy my command He shall retrace his steps;âThis very hour Sees Orellana his. Ourself will seek him. Mean time, Orazia, be it thine to see That traitor die a victim to his crimes. [Exit. Ora. Yield Orellana: Or thy mother's love Turns to vindictive rage. Alzuma. Dishonour blast The horrid counselârather brave with scorn Their fiercest hateâNot all the worst of ills The purple tyrant has in store for virtue Can plead for pardon with your gods abjur'd. Oh! Shun the guilt of treason to your soul!â On the mind fix'd and obstinately just Ev'n ruin falls in vainâ Ora. It falls this moment On thy devoted headâ Orel. Orazia, hear meâ Restrain this rageâall nature starts with horror.â Humanity is shock'dâif he must die, Of all who live, thou should'st be innocent.â Orazia. Cling not about me thusâ Orel. Forbear, forbear The horrid strokeânot all the dews of Heav'n Will wash the barb'rous murder from your hands. Remorse and anguish followâpeace of mind Will ever shun theeâfiends will haunt thy brain, And all the madness of despairing guilt. Orazia. Thou plead'st in vainâmy soul expanding feels The glowing rapture, the exalted purpose That swells above the infirmities of nature, And burns with all it's god.â Orel. Ye host of heav'n! Seize Orellanaâdrag her to your altar; In horrid union bind me to Don Carlos, Rather than break by one atrocious act, All the eternal ties that link the world. Alzuma. Thou break them notâour country and our gods Those are our first connexionsâfor my life It is not worth my careâwho dies for freedom Has liv'd his course of nature and of glory, And who survives it but a single hour, Has liv'd that hour too much.â Orel. My soul resumes Her strengthâI will not yieldâ Ora. The traitor diesâ He dies this momentâ Alzuma. Undismay'd I come. Orel. Noâneverâneverâhere these hands shall hold himâ [A soldier lays hold of her. He shall not dieâtear, tear me piecemeal firstâ I'll perish with him ratherâlet the blow That ends his life, unite us both in deathâ [She is torn from him, a soldier stands at the altar with a lifted sabre. Alzuma. Now Altabalipa, where'er thy spirit Roams in uncertain being, with thy firmness Inspire me nowâteach me like thee to die. Ora. Ah!âwherefore should the slave invoke that name? [She goes near the soldier. Alzuma. Lo thus I bare my bosom! [Goes up to the altar. Ora. Ha! Orel. Yet hold! [Held by a soldier. Thou wretched mother holdâit isâforbearâ It is the purest blood of all Peruâ A vengeful godâa god of wrath beholds The barb'rous deedâI hear his thunder rollâ It bursts the roofâthe pillar'd temple fallsâ It falls to crush ye allâ Alzuma. Here strike at once, And with my life-blood glut her frantic rage. Ora. Forbear (holding the soldier) I charge thee; stop the bloody strokeâ Oh! wonder-working pow'rs! [faints away. Orel. The well known token. Grav'd on his breast has mark'd him for her son. [aside.] Enter Pizarro. Pizarro. No, nought shall shake the purpose of my soulâ Orazia! why thus sinks her drooping spirit? Alzuma. Does justice triumph o'er the gods of Spain? Orel. Recall her heav'n, and o'er her waking sense Pour down your gentlest influence.â Assists Orazia. Pizarro. Rebel slave! Th'exterminating wrath of heav'n pursues theeâ Still shalt thou meet thy fateâ Ora. Oh! lend your aid,â And lead me, lead my stepsâmy Lord Pizarro, If e'er Orazia won thy kind affections, Remit the cruel rigour of the law, And spare a wretch's life.â Pizarro. She too rebelsâ She pleads for heresyâ Ora. Oh, no! I plead For mercy, and for justice.â Pizarro. Would'st thou save That wilful obstinate? reflect Orazia; Is this your faith?âIs this your promis'd zeal? Ora. Zeal in excess is viceâ'tis impiousâ Horrid repugnance to the will of heav'n; Subversive of each virtue; foe to all The tender laws of charity and love; Those laws that raise, and dignify our being, Nature's great edict in the human heart. Pizarro. Thy words are treasonâ Ora. No! 'tis justice speaksâ Thanks to th'eternal pow'rs, at length I see That each religion, truth itself may have Its wild enthusiasts, and its frantic zealots.â Pizarro. By heav'n some hidden meaning lurks beneath This sudden revolution of thy heart. Ora. Oh! spare his innocenceâhave mercyâ Pizarro. Yes, The slave shall live till from that stubborn spirit Torture hath wrung each deep, each hidden purpose. See him secur'd in the deep dungeon's gloom. Alzuma. Yes, lead me hence, where I no more may see This hated raceâbut oh! when I am gone, Respect her woes, her helpless innocenceâ From death I shrink notânature at my birth Condemn'd me to itâsoon the hour shall come When truth, when conscience shall condemn thy deedsâ [Exit. Pizarro. The rebel's doom is fix'dâI burn to see Each shackled slave thro' our extended realm Or live a Christian, or embrace his fate. [Exit. Orazia and Orellana. Ora. Oh! Orellana, 'tisâit is your brotherâ The wound indented on his youthful breastâ Plainly I saw itâ'tis my child, my sonâ Orel. It is Alzumaâoh! I know it allâ This day reveal'd it to meâ Ora. Was it just To leave him thus expos'd?â Orel. He will'd it soâ Ora. Wretch that I am!âI tremble at it stillâ Oh! whither was I plunging!âwhat a depth Of woe and guilt, unutterable guilt, What endless misery have I escap'd! Murder my son!âbarbarity unheard of! It shocks my soulâand did he, could he think, Could my child think me dead to human nature? The thought distracts; it rives a mother's heart, To thee I've been ungentle; thou hast cause To doubt my loveâbut come to my embrace.â Orel. Oh! bless'd event! and do I live to taste This unexpected joy, this dear delight? Ora. The brink of horror, on which late I stood, Recalls from error ev'ry wand'ring sense. Alzuma shall not dieâthe Christian's God Beams the sweet smiles of universal love On all his fair creationâhaughty Spain Perverts his holy laws; but still the pow'r, That warn'd my erring virtue, may inform him Truth only triumphs when it conquers hearts, And never gains by carnage and destruction.â End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene the Palace. Enter Orazia. Oh! Unexpected day of grief and joy! My child, my child!âI have not yet forgot To shed the tear of natural affection, To know for whom I bore the child-bed pang; I am not grown the horror of the world.â Enter Orellana. Orel. Alas! all's lostâDon Carlos rages;âStern Pizarro Thirsts for Alzuma's bloodâ Orazia. A mother's love Shall still protect her offspringâOh! My daughter, Affection long an alien to this heart, Gushes in tumult thro' each panting vein. Despair and anguish too o'erwhelm my spiritsâ Yet, Oh! returning nature! yet thy griefs, Thy very tears are tinctur'd still with joy! 'Tis misery delightfulâ Orel. Yet ev'n now, The fell Gonzalez leads Alzuma forth. Ah! whither do they lead him? Orazia. 'Tis to me They lead your brother forthâone interview Unconscious of his name Pizarro grants. Heav'ns! What an interview!âA son enslav'd, And a fond mother, who usurps his rights!â I cannot see my child!âAnd yet I must, I will behold him!âHear his sad, sad story, Gaze on each featureâclasp him to my heart, And perish with him, if he's doom'd to bleed.â Thou fly to Carlos,âsoothe his troubled mind; Exert your influence, or your brother's lost. Each moment's big with with death.â Orel. Protect him, Gods! Now virtue struggling in the last extreme Calls for your guardian care. [Exit. Orazia. Ye blended colours, both of guilt and virtue, Ye strong emotions mix'd of grief and joy Oh! How your conflict racks my tortur'd soul!â Enter Gonzalez. Gonza. The pris'ner from his dungeon waits your will. Orazia. Give him admittance. [Exit Gonzales] Now all gracious Heav'n, Support a mother;âaid me; touch my lips With thy resistless energy of speech, That I may calm the mighty storm of passions, And reconcile a son to life and truth. Enter Alzuma. Orazia. His awful stern regardâ Alzuma. My firmness fails, And guilty as she is, yet filial love, Yet nature tells me, she's my mother still. Orazia. Approach my sonâEmbrace yourâ Alzuma. Conscious shame, The sense of vile misdeedsâyes, goading conscience Choaks up thy voice, and tells thee that thou artâ Orazia. A tyrant! an usurper!âThat's the name Of horror thou would'st utterâyet Orazia Is not so far abandon'd o'er to guilt, But my heart bounds with transport, even thus At length to see my sonâYou weep Alzumaâ Alzuma. Thou source of light!âBright majesty of Heav'n! Thee I attestâfrom thee implore forgiveness That thus I own a traitress; that these tears Confess the sacred character of son You stamp'd upon my nature.â Orazia. Oh! Alzuma, Did I command thy murder?âEarth and Heav'n! A mother ready to imbrue her hands In her child'sâhorror!âWhy did'st thou conceal The secret from me?âWhy not rush for shelter To these maternal arms?âBut oh! I knew thee; Parental instinct gave the sure alarm, And now to hear thee, view thee thus,âit wakes Unutterable throbbings in my breast. Alzuma. Well may'st thou view me; well may'st thou survey Thy son return'd!âHe brings no foul dishonourâ But thouâcan'st thouâindelible reproach!â Oh! stain to virtue!ârage and indignation Burn in my soul, and kindle madness there. Orazia. Let not impetuous rage disturb thy reason. Heav'n on the Spaniards arms hath smil'd success; Thence on Peru shone forth the ray of truth, Sublimer faith, and pure exalted morals.â Alzuma. Morals!âEach word plants daggers in my heartâ Oh! Give me daggers rather; arm my hand With their own deathful steel, that I may hold it Crimson and glowing with the tyrant's blood, Aloft to view, and call my country free. Orazia. Controul this phrenzyâit were impious murderâ Alzuma. Murder! a sacrifice! a glorious sacrifice! To injured men, and violated laws.â What! he that kill'd my father? And yet she pleads a fell destroyer's cause! Hold heart-strings, crack not yetâa curs'd invader, Who thins the race of man!âEv'n now the cry Of infants murder'd at the fost'ring breast, The shrieks of virgins, dying heroes groans Sound in my earâimperial palaces, The temples of our gods all wrapt in fire! Oh! image not, my soul, the horrid scene. Orazia. I cannot bear his strong, his keen reproach. Alzuma. Yet wedded to him!âwell those tears may gush, Well may those blushes glow upon thy cheek. Detested perfidy!âMy father's heart, That heart, which ever beat with love of thee, Dust as it is, awakens in his tomb, Alive and sensible to guilt like thine; It stirs, it rouzes in the shroud of death, With horror at thy name, and feels it's pangs, It's tortures o'er again. Orazia. Obdurate son! Thus to transfix, and rend a mother's heart.â Alzuma. Am I upon a bed of roses?âLo! in chains My bleeding country! mark in ev'ry region The desolation that lays waste the land! Orazia. Why wilt thou urge me to despair and horror? Oh! kill me rather; let the deadly point Pierce to my heart; I'll arm thee for the blow. Avenge my crime; avenge your country's fall. Alzuma. What says Orazia? Orazia. Stifle in my blood The pious love I bear the Christian's God. Alzuma. Would'st thou debase me to the Spaniard's guilt? If thou indeed believ'st the Christian's God, It is not mine to stab for human error. Farewell! Farewell!âLive happy if thou can'st, Oh! Heav'ns, if happiness can dwell with guilt.â [Going. Orazia. Yet stay, my sonâone momentâ Alzuma. Pow'rful nature!â Thy tender strugglingsâOh! While thus thy hand I bathe with tears, and print my kisses on it, Let me implore thee, own your gods again, My father's spirit callsâthe ghastly shades Of martyr'd millions, martyr'd for their faith, All lift their hands and call aloud for vengeance.â Orazia. Arise, my son, ariseâ Alzuma. Let me not sue, And clasp your knee in vainâ Orazia. Oh! Strong contention 'Twixt grace and nature, 'twixt my God and thee! Alzuma. Resume your dignity, your native honourâ Orazia. But Heav'n prevailsâ Alzuma. Think of your bleeding countryâ Orazia. I cannot, must not hear theeâOh! Alzuma Thy mind is lost in darknessâ Alzuma. How!â Orazia. Thy gods Are superstition's dreamsâ Alzuma. Awayâno moreâ [Rising hastily. I would not hear the voice of profanationâ Go tell your tyrant, all his threats are vainâ Tho' sprung from thee I still can die with gloryâ Farewell! we part for everâ Orazia, Hear meâhearâ Alzuma. Oh! Heav'nsâOraziaâ'tis the last, last time That e'erâmay the just gods forgive thee allâ [Exit. Orazia. Go, cruel, fierce, inexorable son! Go, since thou wilt, to ruin, rush on deathâ 'Twill break thy miserable mother's heart.â Orazia, and Don Carlos. Orazia. Well, Sir, Pizarro now has heard your counsel. Carlos. And Orellana has heard thy advice; That Indian captive too has heard you;âall Thy arts are known; thy fair hypocrisy To varnish treason. Orazia. Oh! Thou wrong'st me much;â Another causeâa cause of tend'rest import; It is the cause of ev'ry Christian virtue; Love, justice, and humanity are in it; All that the earth holds dear, and heav'n approves. Carlos. Treason, rebellion, perfidy are in it. For Orellana's husband all your cares Are tremblingly alive.âThis very day, But for thy treachery, the slave had died. Orazia. Misguided youth!âAlas! you little know Th'eternal bar divine and human laws Have fix'd between themâOrellana's husband! Oh! noâbelieve it notâ Carlos. And wherefore then Alarm'd and wild with fear?âwhy ev'ry art Of tears, of shrieks, and female lamentation, To snatch the rebel from the stroke of justice. Orazia. Alas! these tears flow from the tend'rest source That wakes soft pity in the human heart. CarlosâI cannot speakâ Carlos. Ha! Now by Heav'n I see it allâguilt can no more dissembleâ That look betrays the secrets of the heart.â The fraud stands manifest to viewâ Orazia. Yet hear me, Oh! Carlos, hear me, nor afflict thy self With false, with vain surmiseâOrazia's cares Are busy for the wretchedâ Carlos. Has she then, Perfidious fair!âhas Orellana married That base-born peasant?âAnd does he hope With her, in evil hour, to claim the crown? That is your aim; for that I am deceiv'dâ That care you colour with the specious name Of generous sympathy for human kind. Orazia. I feel it hereâThese are unbidden dropsâ Tis you, rash youth, you, Carlos, that can give Fair virtue's semblance to each wild emotion That prompts the sudden deedâere now 'twas love, That tyrant of thy soul, capricious love, Nay, gen'rous if you will; 'twas that which sav'd The lives of men, if Orellana smil'd; And now she looks averse, the baleful charm Still shoots delicious poison thro' thy soul, And persecuted men must pay the forfeit Of maiden blushes, and of coy disdain. Carlos. Think'st thou Don Carlos means to live the slave Of idle charms, and tyrant beauty's frown? Noâlet her charms neglected fade and perish. May sorrow wither ev'ry nameless grace That revell'd once in those deluding eyes. Then let her lover gaze on faded beauty; Let him enjoyâOh! noâthe slave shall dieâ Then shall his pale inanimated corse Glare in her view, an offering from Don Carlos, The token of his love. Orazia. Away; no more; Inhuman that thou artâ Carlos. Then let her shriek, And rend her hair, and to his clay cold breast Rivet her panting bosomâno! the traitress Shall to the altarâthou shalt lead her thither, And there her blood shall expiate her guilt. Orazia. Thou tiger nurs'd with gore! away, nor dare With savage threats to wound a mother's ear. Carlos. The storm is gather'd, and the thunder soon Shall burst in ruin on their guilty heads. [Exit. Orazia. Inhuman barb'rous man!âAnd must I lead Midst songs of triumph, and thro' festive bands, My daughter crown'd with garlands to the altar? Shall there the priest, fell minister of wrath, Force her to nuptials, which her soul abhors, Which neverâNoâshe'll perish ratherâfirst Give to the cruelax that tender form! And must her mother, must I then return Aloneâheart brokenâdesolateâwithout My child?âthro' arches rais'd with pomp for her? Thro' ways still redolent of ev'ry flow'r, Which, as she went, they strew'd beneath her feet? I will not lead herânoâshe shall not goâ Alzuma tooâOh! misery supreme! Shall he too bleed?âThou murd'rer! hold thy handâ It is Orazia's blood thou shed'stâthe God, Who died for all, will not demand his life!â He speaksâhe menacesâbut see, see there!â He dies, he dies! Enter Orellana. Orazia. Who's there?âWhat would'st thou?âha! Orel. Haste thee, Orazia, haste, and instant think, Think of some means to ward th'impending stroke. Enraq'd Pizarro comes;âAvow your son; Peru's undoubted heir.â Orazia. It must not beâ That fatal truth would overwhelm us allâ Distractionânought remainsâno pow'r can save him. Enter Pizarro, Don Carlos, &amp;c. Pizarro. Yes, bring the traitor forthâthe sanctity Of laws, the policy of our new state Forbid all dull delayâ Enter Alzuma, Gonzalez and Guards. Orazia. Angels of light protect himâSave my son. [Aside. Pizarro. That once again I deign to parley with thee, 'Tis gentle pity promptsâtake heed, rash youth, Or certain deathâ Alzuma. Death is the only boon That Spain can give, or I will deign to take. Come bloody bigot!âReverend assassin! Come on at onceâhere wreak thy pious rage, And do a murder in the name of heav'n! Pizarro. Dost thou reproach us? Thou, who oft hast seen Blind superstition offer human victims, To your own senseless, to your monstrous idols? Alzuma. Polish'd barbarian!âWhat dost thou do less?â Pizarro. Beware, not tempt my vengeance! Alzuma. Thou art he, Who come'st to teach thy doctrine sword in hand, To tyrannize our souls; from free-born men Withhold the sacred privilege of thinking. Thou hast unchain'd, to spread destruction round, Two fiends accurst; Lo! where insatiate avarice Enslaves mankind! Lo! Spanish hierarchy Erects her scarlet head; with pious rage Bears in her breast a poniard, and with blood Incarnadines the altar of her god. Pizarro. Slave mark my words.âNo more I'll waste the hours In vain debateâResign thyself to Spain; Abjure thy errors, and embrace the truth, Or else this moment sweeps thee from my sight, To die, in view of thy deluded friends, A terrible example of our vengeance. Orazia. No, by the pow'rs above he shall not die. The voice of heav'n restrains the murd'rer's hand, A voice that's heard thro' all the peopled earth, Resounding to the limits of the world. Pizarro. Beware, beware, Orazia!â Carlos. Still she favours That insolent, who spurns the light of heav'n. Orazia. Oh! 'tis the light of heav'n informs my soul. These strong emotions by the Pow'r Supreme Were planted hereâThe spirit that impels To blood and murder, cannot be from heav'n. Nature, thou lead'st me onâmy child, my chilâ I will protect theeâNow, inhuman men, Now come, and tear him from a mother's arms. Orel. Yes, both, my brotherâboth will perish with thee. Pizarro. By heav'n this treason!â Carlos. Orellana's brother! And not her husband!âThen my heart's at peace. [Aside. Pizarro. What means this myst'ry?âSay, art thou Alzuma? Alzuma. Behold me, Spaniard; let thine eye survey meâ Shrinks not thy heart within thee?âRead'st thou not A royalty of nature here? Pizarro. Forthwith Say wilt thou take thy life on our conditions? Alzuma. There are conditions that may win my soul Not wholly to abhor thee. Pizarro. Name thy terms! Alzuma. Lay down at once the persecuting sword, Relieve from slavery a groaning world, Ask what we suffer, not what we believe, Display your morals, not your bigot faith. If avarice is your god, take gold enough; Freight well your ships, and may propitious gales In safety waft you to your native shores. That doneâin time we may perhaps forget, We may at least forgive you. Pizarro. Vanquish'd slave! And to a conqueror dar'st thou thus to utter Thy stubborn pride! Alzuma. Back to your native shores! What do you here, amidst a virtuous race? Pizarro. The laws of conquest, and the laws of Spainâ Alzuma. And dar'st thou, homicide, alledge the laws? The laws of Spainâknow there's a prior law, To which weak mortals are not train'd, but born; Not form'd by science, but endow'd by instinct, Great nature's law!âthat best, that surest guide; That emanation from the pow'rs above; O'er all diffus'd, immutable, eternal! This who shall silence, who shall dare repeal? Who strives to do it abdicates his nature; Renounces all the honours of his being, And by the act,âtho' justice ne'er o'ertake him, Pays full atonement:âHe's a wretch indeed. Pizarro. I'll hear no more; since thus thy heart is steel'd, Thus obstinately fix'd in wilfull guilt, The justice that pronounc'd thy father's doom, Awaits thy crimes.âNo dark assassin's stab Ended his days:âTo our tribunal call'd In full assembly of the conquering chiefs He was arraign'd, was heard, and died for treason To Spain's imperial crown. Carlos. And shall that mockery, That stain to justice, that black scene of horror Be acted o'er again? Pizarro. And dost thou too, Dost thou rebel, confed'rate in their guilt! Our will is fix'd:âere yonder sun decline, Hear me thou slave!âor yield to truth and Spain, Or else yon sunâthat idol of your worship, Shall see thee on the rack in pangs expire. [Exit. Carlos. Thou brave heroic youth, thy ev'ry virtue Demands my wonderâby yon heav'n I swear Thou shalt not suffer; my soul eager pants To know, to love, to burn in friendship with thee. [Exit. Ora. AlzumaâOh! my sonâin this distress How shall the wretched mother save her child? Alzuma. Waste not a thought on me; thy own misdeeds, Repent of them; and since the gods withhold A brave revenge, 'tis left us still to die, And greatly perish in our country's ruin. Gon. You must not linger here: my duty bids me Convey thee hence. Ora. Thou busy meddler!âhere Orazia now commandsâI lead him forth. And who shall dare oppose a mother's voice? [Exit with Alzuma. Orel. Yet grant us vengeance, heav'n; Oh! give us still To conquer ev'n in death, then mix triumphant, With pensive ghosts, and roam the shadowy plain, Where all is peace, all bliss in endless store, And no pernicious Spaniard thirsts for gold.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene the Temple of the Sun. Enter Orazia and Orellana. Orazia. Go, cruel go, and leave me to my woes. Orel. I feel 'em allâbut what, beset with ills, Can Orellana do? Orazia. What can she do? Prevent the strokeâassuage Pizarro's furyâ That canst thou do, yet obstinately fix'dâ Orel. But fix'd in honourâOh! thou little know'st Alzuma's soulâHe will not take a life Purchas'd by vile disgrace; will ne'er survive To see Don Carlos seize my plighted hand, That he may linger out his days in bondage. Orazia. And if his ardour, if his ev'ry virtue Swell o'er their bounds, and bear his reason down, Wilt thou unpityingâthe bare image strikesâ Weep'st thou my daughter?âLet the gen'rous sorrow Melt thy hard heart and bid Alzuma live. Orel. Would heav'n I could! but if my brother fall, With him 'tis fix'd to dieâThrice happy both If ev'n in ruin our unshaken zeal Our country honours, and our gods approve.â Orazia. Then go, rush on, unnatural as thou art, Go since thou wilt and see a brother bleedâ I'll to the altar tooâThe blow that sheds Alzuma's blood will be Orazia's last.â Enter Carlos. Car. Let joy succeed and triumph in your heartsâ I bring ye gladsome tidings.â Orazia. Speak thy purposeâ Car. I've seen your sonâat length each raging passion To peace subsides, and takes a milder tone. His errors vanish and with sense reclaim'd He dedicates his soul to truth and Spain. Orel. What do I hear?âThe tale of infamyâ Orazia. Then is Orazia blestâmy son shall liveâ But tell meâdoes Alzumaâtell me allâ Means he this dayâ Car. This very hour he meansâ To offer up his vows at yonder altar; He and his chosen friendsâHe only asks That while Pizarro views the solemn act, The gazing multitude may stand aloof, Nor interrupt him in his holy work. Orazia. All bounteous Providence!ânow, now indeed You give me back my sonâUpon the wing Of love and rapture let me seek Pizarro, Tell him this unexpected bless'd event, That saves at once a mother and her child. [Exit. Orel. Thou hear'st it, radiant Deity; thou hear'st This worst of crimes, nor yet thy orbit halts, Nor turns its course back to the astonish'd east, Nor impious mortals dread eternal night!â Carlos. Suppress this storm of passion; smiling peace Comes with her gentle train, and love prepares His torch to brighten all our future hours. Orel. All truth is fled; Alzuma is a slave! Carlos. Henceforth esteem and dignities await him; New joys and all that lavish hearts can pour. Orel. Let him accept them; let him meanly stoop To take a conqueror's gifts; these are your arts, The arts of tyranny, by which you draw With baleful luxury, with bland allurements, Each captive mind, till weak deluded men, Grown the voluptuous slaves of ev'ry vice, Become the slaves of ev'ry master too.â Car. A moment brings him to youâthen you'll see He comes with mind enlighten'dâTruth divine Will from his lip more welcome touch thy ear, And hush to peace this tumult of thy soul. [Exit. Orellana. The tumult of my soul will ever rage. Well, injur'd deities, you fly a land, Where not one virtue's leftâyou have full causeâ Ev'n your own progeny betrays your rightsâ To hostile gods betraysâyet let those gods Boast of their proselyteâto them he'll prove A young, a subtle hypocriteâEach vow The traitor offers at their Christian shrine To his own heart, to universal nature Will give the lye, and stamp the guilt upon him By men and gods abhorr'dâthe tenfold guilt Of daring to equivocate with heav'n! I will not live to see itâHa! he comesâ Enter Alzuma. Alzuma. My sister!âwhy is this?âthou shun'st me then?â Thou shun'st thy brother?â Orel. Thou hast ruin'd allâ Alzuma. Distract me not with thy unkind disdainâ All that is great in nature leads me onâ And my heart labours with the vast conception. Orel. Vain effort to disssemble!âEven now The strong expressive characters of guilt Glare in thy eye, and shoot their livid fires. Alzuma. Talk not of guiltâthou little know'stâ Orel. Not talk, When faith and truth, the sense of ancient honour Are trampled down? when in base abject fear A brother derogates from all his race, Abjures at once his country and his gods, And with the foe capitulates for life? Alzuma. Thy virtue charms me; but thou ill dost chuse This awful periodâ'tis a moment big With desperation, with disast'rous change, And horrible intentsâI see thee now Perhaps for the last time.â Orel. What say'st thou?âHa!â That look terrific! But too plain I readâ And yet they told meâ Alzuma. Who? Orel. Don Carlos. Alzuma. What? Orel. Of gods abjur'dâ Alzuma. And did'st thou hate thy brother? Orel. And can'st thou blame me?â Alzuma. I do thank thee for itâ Orel. Still thou art true?â Alzuma. As heav'n's foundation fix'd! Fix'd as the marble pillars of the world. Orel. Have I then wrong'd thee?âOh! Alzuma.â Alzuma. Come, Thou best of sisters, daughter of the sun! Worthy thy character!âCome to my heartâ And yet is this a time, this hour of horror To pour the softest transports of the soul, And mingle tears with madness and despair? Orel. Thy words, thy looks, appall my frighted sense, Alas! my brother, ere we partâ Alzuma. No more;â I charge thee urge no moreâwhate'er my lot, Thou'lt wonder and applaud. Orel. Yet boading fears! Let me attend thy steps. Alzuma. It must not beâ Wait here thy mother's coming; with apt speech Beguile her stayâI would not have her near meâ Time flies; the hour draws nigh; Immortal pow'rs! The genius of Peru! The fates are busy!â All nature pauses for the great event. Orel. Thy words portentousâha! Pizarro comes!â Enter Pizarro. Pizarro. At length, Alzuma, with serenest influence Grace lights upon theeâCome, the altar blazes; Thy friends are rang'd aroundâthe brazen gates Exclude the busy throngâall things are readyâ Alzuma. All ready saidst thou? Pizarro. AllâWe wait but youâ Alzuma. Horror!âYou wait but me!âgo onâI followâ Pizarro. Approving heav'n smiles on the just design; This holy work perform'dâall will be well. [Exit Pizarro. Alzuma. Be firm my heart, and you, my trembling sinews, Hold, hold a whileâWhat hollow voice is that? Orel. 'Tis silence deep, and solemn stillness roundâ Alzuma. âNow is the time,â it criesâI come, I comeâ The sacred impulseâhark!âit calls againâ Ye crimson spectres! and yet gleaming fires! Ye spirits of revenge, who point my wayâ Lead on;âyour mortal instrument I come!â [Exit. Orel. Oh! how my heartâwho's there?â Enter Orazia. Orazia. And will you still With scorn reject a lover's tend'rest vows? Let me prevailâ Orel. 'Tis not an hour for love! Orazia. Not when your brotherâ Orel. He approves it notâ Orazia. Has he not call'd Pizarro to the altar? Orel. He wish'd to meet him thereâ Orazia. He wishes tooâ To see his sister recompence at length Her lover's faithful firesâWhere is Alzuma? Hast thou not seen him?â Orel. He went hence but now.â Orazia. Then he has sought the altarâLet us thither. Orel. I'll come anonânot nowâit were not fit You should be thereâfar other work impendsâ The work of fateâ'twere best remainâyou must not goâ Orazia. What mean those falt'ring accents?âha!âwhat noise? Orel. Defend me, heav'nly pow'rs, defend meâ Orazia. Hark! Pizarro within the Scene. Perfidious traitor! Cleave him to the groundâ Orazia. They murder him, they kill my sonâforbearâ Hold, ruffians, holdâ [Exit. Alzuma within the Scenes. The gods, the injur'd gods Demand his bloodâ Orellana. 'Tis my brother's voiceâ Yes, strike Alzuma; with redoubled blow Avenge a father's death.âOh! how my heart Pants in this dread suspense with hope and fear! I tremble for the eventâLook down ye pow'rs And shield my brother's life. [Exit. Enter Gonzalez. Gonz. Wild tumult fills The spacious temple.âHa! again I hear it. Whence this fierce uproar?â Enter Carlos. Carlos. Treason and murder!âsound there, sound th'alarm! [a flourish of trumpets, and the bell tolls. Gonz. Alas! What new eventâwhat have the fatesâ Carlos. Oh! 'tis a spectacle of woe and horror! My father dies a victim to their fury. With treacherous arts Alzuma hath deceiv'd us. The rites were all prepar'd: the lawn-rob'd priest Stood reverend at the altar; tapers blaz'd, Incense arose and organs fill'd the choir, When forth Alzuma came with solemn pace Looking submissionâWe scarce saw the blowâ Wing'd with the light'ning's speed he sheath'd his dagger Deep in my father's heart. Gonz. What says my Lord? Recall the words. Carlos. Oh blind and fatal rashness That drew me unsuspecting to the altar! No sword, no weapon to defend his life! Yet with what force I could, with desp'rate rage I rush'd amidst their throngâEv'n that was vain, The traitor's friends that instant clos'd around me, And I no aid could giveâWhy lingers thus The tardy soldier? will no friend supply An instrument of vengeance? Gonz. Soon the guards Shall stop each avenueâAlzuma then Shall pay the forfeit of his horrid treason. Carlos. With lion rage he dash'd him on the ground; With his left hand grasp'd the dishevell'd hair, And round his arm the plaited locks intwining In gore he dragg'd him to the altar's base; And I the while could only rend the air With piercing criesâthey held my feeble arms. Gonz. And is he martyr'd thus by savage hands, His conquest stopt, and all his laurels wither'd? Carlos. Orazia comesâshe raves, she screams, she flies Wilder than winds; upon her mangled Lord Throws her extended body, clasps him close; Then looking piteous up with streaming eyes, âForbear my sonâforbear: thou shalt not murder.â But nought can save Pizarro from his rageâ âDie, monster, dieââhe cried, then tore him from her Along the crimson marbleâin despair Upward she sprung, and darting round his neck With circling arms, entreats, implores, beseeches, Bathes his broad chest with tears, and vainly strives To save a husband from a murd'rer's rage: Gonz. Detested treacherous villain! Carlos. Arm, arm my friends. Arm all Peru and give the means of vengeance. Gonz. This way, my LordâRevenge will now be ours, At yonder gate I see the faithful bands. Carlos. Do thou go forth and let the troops invest The temples roundâLet ev'ry pass be clos'd That none escape my fury. [Exit Gonzales.] Righteous heav'n! Now in your cause stern justice lifts the sword, And the fell murderer from the altar dragg'd Shall fall a victim to my just revenge. [Exit. [Flourish of trumpets and bell tolls.] Enter Alzuma and Ozmar. Alzuma. Brave Ozmar, oh! To ev'ry injur'd god this reeking blade Pour'd hot libation of the tyrant's blood.â Ozmar. Immortal spirits, crown him, crown the hero; The godlike blow for liberty is struck. Alzuma. The murd'rer of mankind has breath'd his last.â Enter Orellana. Alzuma. My Orellana, ha!âwhat means that look Ghastly and pale?âWherefore that trembling step? Thou art not wounded? Orel. Oh! too deepâtoo deepâ Thou too Alzumaâborn to bitter woe! Deep in thy heart is fix'd the mortal stabâ The altar blushes with forbidden bloodâ Thy wretched motherâ Alzuma. Speak; distract me notâ Orel. Ev'n now she diesâ Alzuma. By the dread pow'r's of vengeance, Who e'er has dar'dâI here attest the godsâ Orel. Attest not heav'n against yourselfâThy armâ Alas! thy desp'rate arm. Alzuma. What dost thou mean? Orel. Too plain I sawâas round your neck she clung, And sued for mercy to Pizarro's life; You thenâunconsciousâbent on other mischiefâ As still she struggled to restrain thy armâ Then gush'd the sacred blood that gave you being. Alzuma. Open thou earth, and take meâtake me down To scare the fiends belowâ The back Scene draws, and discovers an Altar, Pizarro lying dead, and several Indians standing round. Orazia is brought forward. Orel. And lo!âsee there See where the miserable victim comes. Orazia. Oh! I am faintâI dieâsoftâlay me down.â Orel. Disastrous fate! Alzuma. Have I deserv'd this misery? Orazia. I die!âalas! I dieâwhere are my children?â My OrellanaânearerâOh! Alzuma!â Wilt thou not know me?âin this last distress Not lend a pitying hand?â Alzuma. 'Tis red with bloodâ With horrid parricideâits touch will blast Thy sad remains of lifeâ Orazia. Approach Alzumaâ Support meâLend your handâYours, Orellana, yoursâ Life ebbs a paceâI leave ye bothâI leave My dear, dear childrenâYet to hold ye thus Makes ev'n langour smileâand softens all The pangs of deathâ Alzuma. I call each god to witness, Each cruel god, I never meant to harm That matron breast that gave its nurture to me. Orel. Alas the agonies of death are on her. Enter Carlos. Carlos. There fix your station guards!âOrazia too Deform'd and gash'd with wounds! in death's embrace! Fell savage monster! Torture waits your guilt.â Orazia. Forbear, forbear; the warning hand of heav'n With these events repays our thirst of bloodâ Too much has flow'd alreadyâLet my child Now live in peaceâit is my dying pray'r.â Alzuma. Dost thou forgive thy horrible assassin?â Orazia. 'Twas not thy guiltâMischance, 'twas dire mischance That wrought the deedâI thought they murder'd thee, I flewâthy mother flew to save her childâ In that sad momentâOh!â Orel. Yet spare her heav'n! Alzuma. She dies in torment.â Orazia. No, Alzuma, noâ I feel no pain my childâIn me thou seest How an expiring christian suffers deathâ Thou God of mercyâha!âhold!âraise me upâ Alzuma, where, where ar't thou?âYet a word If ever I was dearâif everâOh!â [Dies. Alzuma. She's gone; she's gone; and with her dying breath Pardon'd her murderer!âCould she then forgive me? Is that a christian virtue? Carlos. 'Tis the virtue Which you have spurn'd; but since th'expiring saint Granted her pardon,âSpain accords it too!â Alzuma. Strike me, just gods, deep to the centerâhere I stand a parricideâa mother's blood Still glows upon this hand!âAnd are ye not Gods of just vengeance? Will your wrath permit A wretch like me to stalk the groaning earth? Ye mountains hide me!âOh! no place can hide A deed accurs'd like mine! [Falls down. Orel. And do I live To see my mother thus?âA ghastly form! A little while and those dead lips had utt'rance! That heart beat warm with gen'rous affection! Thus do I see thee? Is this mangled corse All that is left me of thee? Carlos. She, like me Has lost a parentâLend her your assistance, My friends, support her weak and tender frame. Alzuma. (Rising on his knees) She gave me being, and this impious hand Hath giv'n a stab to nature: to the womb That brought me forth, bears the assassin's knife; I wait just pow'rs for your dread pleasure: strike Hereâstrike at once; launch your red vengeance downâ Punish and pity me!â Carlos. His woes are great And his heart lab'ring with the strong compunction Speaks the soul big with ev'ry gen'rous instinct, Wild nature's growthâForgive me, oh, my father, Who there liest stretched in deathâif I respect The virtues of a foeâAlzuma riseâ Repentance may effaceâ Alzuma. Away, nor talk (starting up) Of fruitless penitenceâno gods can pardon A crime like thisâSee there those glaring orbs! That bosom gor'd by this destructive hand!â Orazia!âoh that look, that smile in death Damns me beyond all depthâAnd yet I must I will approach her (kneels down by her) I no more can murder theeâ Where are your tortures, Spaniard? Lo! that sightâ Tear outâdissect my heart.â Carlos. Alzuma hear meâ In thee I have beheld the fierce extreme Of savage virtueâfor a father lost You've laid a scene of bloodâBut now behold A Christian's virtueâBy thy fatal arm My father there lies deadâand I forgive youâ Alzuma. Forgive!âForgive me said'st thou! Carlos. Yes, nay more; I pity your misfortunesâfor your country You've bravely fought! and I applaud your valour. For the mistaken zeal which here by slaughter Would plant the worship of the God of peace, I do disclaim it allâThat righteous God Who gave the sun its light, and from his hand Launch'd forth the stars into the void immense, He tells weak erring manâWe may persuade Our fellow creatures to embrace their good, But ev'n for truth itself must not destroy. Orel. (Rising up) Oh! wherefore, Carlos, were those godlike virtues To this sad hour conceal'd! Christians and Indians Both, both have err'd alikeâThe cruelty That mark'd its way with blood, provok'd revenge: But this your effort of unheard of goodness, Bids us repent ev'n of our country's love, Ev'n of our gods, and Orellana's heart Turns christian at the thought!â Alzuma. Oh, lost Peru! Fall'n, fall'n indeed!âthy foe was hitherto A robber, and a murderer!ânow he conquers; Now his religion triumphsâall thy gods, Oh, land belov'd! thy gods prepare for flight, They yield to some divinity unknown, Some great first cause of all!âand shall yon sun Move at a maker's will his stated round, No longer now ador'd!âthe host of stars, Shall they be deem'd his work? the rainbow too, That over arches the wide tracts of air, Is his the hand that bent it?âI am lost In doubt and wonder!âSpaniard mark my words: If such the virtues which your God inspires We'll learn of thee to live. And oh! will learn Thou murdered excellence! of thee to die.â Carlos. Enlighten'd hence, ye rulers of each state Learn to extinguish fierce religious hate; Truth came reveal'd from the eternal mind, To bid us love, and not destroy mankind. Not blast the work, which heav'n with pleasure owns, Hear, bigot kings! and tremble on your thrones. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. HARTLEY. Our Play thus o'er, now swells each throbbing breast With expectation of the coming jest. By Fashion's law, whene'er the Tragic Muse With sympathetic tears each eye bedews; When some bright Virtue at her call appears, Wak'd from the dead repose of rolling years, When sacred Worthies she bids breathe anew, That men may be,âwhat she displays to view; By fashion's law, with light fantastic mien The comic Sister trips it o'er the scene; Arm'd at all points with wit and wanton wiles, Plays off her airs, and calls forth all her smiles; Till each fine feeling of the heart be o'er, And the gay wonder how they wept before. Say, do you wish, ye bright, ye virtuous train, That ev'ry tear that fell, should fall in vain? If this night's scenes soft pity could impart, Tis yours to fix the fashion of the heart. Adopt, ye fair, the lost Alzuma's cause, His ruin'd empire, and expiring laws. For Orellana may I dare to plead? My faults will all your kind indulgence need. On you my hopes are fix'd:âOne smile from you To me is worth the treasures of Peru.</field>
