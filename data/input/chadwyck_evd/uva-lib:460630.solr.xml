      <field name="fulltext">TO THE GENERATION KNOCKING AT THE DOOR Breakâbreak it open; let the knocker rust: Consider no âshalt notâ, and no man's âmustâ: And, being entered, promptly take the lead, Setting aside tradition, custom, creed; Nor watch the balance of the huckster's beam; Declare your hardiest thought, your proudest dream: Await no summons; laugh at all rebuff; High hearts and youth are destiny enough. The mystery and the power enshrined in you Are old as time and as the moment new: And none but you can tell what part you play, Nor can you tell until you make assay, For this alone, this always, will succeed, The miracle and magic of the deed.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene: Sir Tristram Sumner's study in his house in Piccadilly. Sir Tristram is reading an old letter. When the door opens he puts the letter hastily in his pocket. Enter Lady Sumner. Sir T. Martha! You've come to trouble me; your eyes Are lustreless and evil. Will it end At all? Will you give over urging death? Lady S. A visitor. Sir T. Who is it? Lady S. Warwick Groom. Sir T. Impossible: at any time impossible. I hate him, Martha. Lady S. Hate? Hate Warwick Groom! I thought you hated no one. Sir T. So did I! But him I hate; becauseâhe was my friend. Lady S. And would be still. Sir T. Therefore I hate him more! But that's not true: hate fathoms hate, and answers Index-like, the searching current of its thought, Down through the earth, or round it in the nerveless Air. Deep he hates me; by my hate I know. I tell you, Martha, were Warwick Groom and I Alone together for an hour, the death Of either or of both would testify Our rooted rancour. Lady S. I cannot understand! True, he is wild, this Warwick Groom of ours, And doors are shut against him; but a braver Artist starves not anywhere. Sir T. Starves? Let him starve. Lady S. This is so new, so sudden, Tristram! Sir T. No; Nothing is sudden that the heart brings forth. The mushroom spawn of passing loves and hates By thunder-showers and puddles quickly bred, To rot as quickly, in sequestered nooks Or by the trodden highways, are nothingânothing But rashes on the skin. Lady S. You change the figure: The very rhapsody of Warwick Groom! Sir T. Plastic as molten metal! Living hate Mine is, a deeply struck deliberate cancer In the heart, and half as old as I: half Of my life it is: I know it now mature That knew it not a-growing: wholesome hate! A wholesome cancer, a resourceful pain, A fount of passion! Lady S. You forget yourself; For now you stare and pant like some insane Unhappy woman, sick with jealousy, Her strangled voice and prayer, âOh, just to crush âMy rival like a flea!â Sir T. So would I do! Lady S. I cannot understand you. Sir T. I understand. We know each other, Warwick Groom and I. No legendary friendship ever wove The lives of men in such a gallant web As ours displayed: the secrets of our hearts Were interchanged like goodly gifts that made The giver and receiver ache with joy: Our thoughts, our deeds, our sins were known and loved Of either; nothing irksome, trivial, dull Could happen day or night to him or me Since telling of it gave it import, grave Or humorous, subtle, sweet, or sad. Too well, Too infinitely well we knew each other! Grudge, longing, foible, vanity, conceit, Ambition, terror, cowardice, fancy, whim Revealed themselves in either's consciousness Beyond the scope and verge of comely minds, That there might still be something to confide, Some proof of new affection: once, at least, Two men should know each other inside out! To cut and carve a specimen, a corpse, A limbless, headless trunk, malodorous, foul, O'er-hacked, o'er-handled by anatomists, Tyros and demonstrators, makes a job Cleaner than knowing truly inside out The heart of man, the actual heart of man, Not in a general mass of studies culled From books, but in particular, one's friend. Had fortune not divided us I know Both had gone mad. He hates the thought of me, As I the thought of himâthe natural end Of every intimacy pushed outside The limit. Souls are clad and should be seen In vestments only: things and thoughts there are We must not think: forbidden is the tree Of knowledge still to those that love themselves, Their friends, their art, their people and the world. This is a righteous hate in him and me. Lady S. It desolates my heart to think it true! What shall I say to him? Sir T. Give him some food, Some drink, some money. Lady S. But he comes with news! Oh, I forgot; you moved me so! Your Troilus, It seems, is ill. Sir T. Ah; so. He looked consumptive. The under-study is letter-perfect. Lady S. Yes; But think: the first of such a playâso harsh, So questionable. Sir T. Interest follows Troilus: This is a blow; but not a deadly one. Lady S. And fortune's blows may prove caresses. Warwick Can play the part. Sir T. Groom? In my theatre? Martha! Lady S. I once had leave to counsel you, though now You shun me, Tristramâ Sir T. Martha! Lady S. Yes, you do; And take the mind of every one but me. Tristram, you know my heart. Is it unclean Like Warwick Groom's? You loved me once: has love Fermented, like your friendship, into hate? Sir T. Should not a woman's heart escape the probe Men search each other with, the fathom line, The dredge, the sunken shaft that brings to light No pearls of price, no gems, nor golden ore, But wreck and rust, drowned hopes and dead men's bones? Lady S. There's terror in your mind: terror for me, And terror for yourself!âBut this is vain.â I think that help has come; I yet may live. The play, the play! No question Warwick Groom Is Troilus to the accent. Have you lost Your love of art along with other loves? Sir T. Martha! Lady S. Forgive me that.âEuropa Troop: It's not for love, the world and I know well, You tossed her Cressida. The wanton salt Of her, so loathsome to a passionate mind, Is admirable here; and art demands This sacrifice besides, since it may beâ That you should give the hated Warwick Groom A part predicting him, so like a glove It fits him. Sir T. Let me think; and youâthink you: Will âTroilus and Cressidaâ succeed? Lady S. I think it will; if you salute what chance Provides, a perfect Troilus. Sir T. Do you feel The fit upon youâyour telepathic mood? Lady S. I hardly know: I think the play is safe. Sir T. If Groom plays Troilus? Lady S. If Groom plays Troilus. Sir T. You say he knows the part. How can that be? Lady S. That you must ask him. Sir T. Martha! Lady S. Fateâit's fate. Sir T. What's his condition? Is he well put on? Drunkâsoberâmaudlin? How? Lady S. Sober and trim; Pallid and beautiful. Sir T. You loved him once. Lady S. Tristram! Sir T. I mean, he was in love with you. Lady S. You knew that from the first. Sir T. But never knew If you loved him. Lady S. You never asked me that! Sir T. It never troubled me; nor does it now: But every question that a man may put, Or may not put a woman, shapes itself Some time or other; and the chastest mind, When love begins to mellow, and passion falls, A ripened friendship from the tree of life, Thinks of his wife one time at least, âhad I Her maidenhead?â Lady S. Tristram! Sir T. The word escaped. Lady S. Oh, you are crude and cruel! But I am for you:â Not every husband; some men marry widows; Some marry harlots; someâ Sir T. Yes; some? Lady S. It seems Some marry virgins and are none the wiser. Sir T. That's not like dying. Lady S. No. And Warwick Groom? Sir T. Yes; but remain. Not him alone with me. Lady S. There's something in your mind more than you say. Sir T. Without a doubt. No man can speak his mind. Lady S. But every woman can, I think. Sir T. And does? Lady S. If she be gently asked. Sir T. What shall I ask? Lady S. Ask? Anything. But you are harassed, ill. Let me conclude with Groom. Sir T. No; bring him in. [Sir Tristram at the telephone communicates with his business manager, Abbot, while Lady Sumner goes out and re-enters with Warwick Groom. Groom. Tristram! Sir T. [At the telephone] Warwick!âold friend! (No, Abbot; wait.) Groom. You'll give me this? Sir T. You know the part? Groom. I know it. Lady S. We'll test him, Tristram. [Takes up a copy of Troilus and Cressida. Sir T. Shame! (Yes? Sumner. No. A dozen Heidsieck? Yes, at once; from me. Send him my love; tell him he shall get well.) You never played it? Groom. No; I studied it When you announced the play a year ago; And when you placed it in rehearsalâ Sir T. Yes; You wrote me, I remember. Groom. And received No answer. Lady S. Tristram! Sir T. Hateful oversight! Forgive me, Warwick. Having cast the part, Not knowing you were free . . . (Yes. Sumner. What? Yes; let the understudy dress. No. Yes. Perhaps we'll have another Troilus. Groom. To-night. Oh no! I think. A great success.) Lady S. And now I'll test him. Sir T. Women are merciless! Lady S. And that's the cue! I speak for Hector, Warwick. âUnarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy, âI'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.â Groom. âBrother, you have a vice of mercy in you âWhich better fits a lion than a man.â Lady S. âWhat vice is that, good Troilus? Chide me for it.â Groom. âWhen many times the captive Grecians fall, âEven in the fan and wind of your fair sword, âYou bid them rise and live.â Lady S. âO, 'tis fair play!â Groom. âFool's playââI'll not go on, for I have asked Like courteous mercy, Tristram. Sir T. You have brought Mercy to us, boyâa Troilus unmatched From swift Scamander to the lordly Thames. Groom. Then am I happy. Tristram, Martha, years How many have I wasted; ten, a dozen, Despairing up and down the railways, caught And imprisoned, like some adventurer Forlorn, in dreary tunnels, stations, inns, Provincial companies and theatres, The dismallest labyrinth where every step Stumbles at skeletons of dead ambitions And dying reputations; as close to London As the suburbs are, further away, that is, Than hell from heaven, and bitterer than hell. Be hung upon the fringe of paradise, Stewing in brimstone with the spicy scent Of asphodel to lave the sulphurous air, And envy Tantalus his pleasant lines For ever and a day! Sir T. You keep your zest Of talk, your thunder and lightning. Groom. Let me talkâ A minute! It's a dozen lifetimes since We met. The luck of some! the luck! Old gag, The luck! It seems but yesterday that I Beheld the Parthenon, one towering wave Of wild delight from stalls to gallery, break At my feet, the vanguard of a tide Of triumph, governed by the moon of hearts, The world's applause, that should have borne me on To the trade winds and harbours of success. One seasonâonly one in London town! Two failures after, and with finer parts Than that that seemed to place me, cast me out Provincial and suburban derelict. Nightly to play upon the blood and brain Of London!âTristram! Martha!âOn the best, Most beautiful and bravest folk on earth!â Ah, let them sneer that fail! I never fail Although I seem to, for I love the world, And all that's in it, and what's best I love The best!âTo play on London's sense and heart With passion and emotion, tears and flame, Laughter and anguish, terror, splendour, mightâ As you do, Tristram, and as I could do: Is there vocation, mission, martyrdom That equals it? Oh, every night to act A part of power, and feel a thousand hearts Beat stroke for stroke with yours, in heaven, in hell, In Londonânowhere else!âin London town, The core of the world: ten years of thatâthreeâone, Then any death in rags and hospitals, Garrets and dens and drunkenness, disgraced, Forgotten, but my inmost will achieved! Sir T. Your pulses hum with youth, and scarce two years Between us! Lady S. Scarce a year! Groom. And that makes less Than nothing 'twixt the tropics where we are, The equatorial forties. Sir T. Less than nothing. Lady S. This, then, is Troilus, Tristram? Sir T. Troilus? Yes! Off to the theatre; dress; rehearse all day, And fire the town at night. Groom. I'll play the part As ne'er I played! Thanks from my soul, deep thanks, Tristram and Martha. Till the call-boy calls! [Goes out. Sir T. Still more excitable, more frenzied. Notâ? Lady S. Oh, no! the febrile genius of the man. Some wine he had from me, so worn he seemed: One glass; it lit him like a torch, Sir T. [At the telephone] (Yes. Groom: He takes the part. My great regret express To all the principals, because to-day I break their well-earned rest: pick out your words: Summon them promptly to rehearse with Groom. What? Surely. Fifty. See him when he comes. No; extra: mornings, extra. Tut! I can't give less. Yes; keep the understudy under arms. Myself? At three. Box-office; libraries? That's good . . . Ah! . . . Dubious: time will tell.) Booked for a week, and there it stops! Lady S. Oh, Tristram! Let me see! [She presses one hand to her eyes and grasps the copy of âTroilus and Cressidaâ tightly in the other.] Clear! Yes; if Groom plays Troilus! Sir T. If Groom playsâ Lady S. Hush! Again I see and hear! [Throws away the book and uncovers her eyes. Psychic, or magic, out of heaven or hell That message comes: âIf Warwick Groom plays Troilus.â Sir T. It rings with menace. Lady S. Terror! Should we fail?â Oh, we are ruined, Tristram! Sir T. Once for all! That I am facing. Lady S. They will help you yet! Sir T. Not now. Failure to-night begins the end. My personal triumph and the theatre's Cannot be questionedâ Lady S. Who would dare! Sir. T. But debt Increases like a tide when sun and moon Uplift the mass of waters and the west Scourges the huge Atlantic. Now you laugh: That's best. My guarantors withdraw their names To-night, if failure knells the curtain down. Lady S. Tristram!âour own account!âthat's overdrawn! Sir T. And overdrawn again! Lady S. The tragedy! The only tragedy! The end of love, The loss of children, snuffing out of hope, Decay of soul is happiness itself Beside the want of meansâwith our desires, Experience, fancies, dreams. Sir T. Yes, but you laughed; And you must laugh again and yet again. Why, Martha, with a roof above our heads, A crust to eat, we will be what we are, The essence of ourselves, in every fate. Lady S. Live poor again? Not for a moment, Tristram! No man can be himself in poverty, Nor woman either: all the world knows that, And sweats and aches and lies and sins for wealth. No, Tristram; but the old deliverance. Sir T. What? Lady S. [Takes a vial from her pocket] This, that so often set our hearts at rest. Sir T. Have I not told you never to show me that? Lady S. Yes; but I show it. Is your courage gone? Are you afraid to look upon the past? Sir T. What purpose can it serve? Lady S. It eases me To talk of it. Do you remember, Tristram? Sir T. What ghouls you are, you women! What hyenas, Digging for ever in the past! Lady S. Have you Forgotten? Is your memory such a sieve? Sir T. No! I remember many heady times When although fortune scowled and fate undid Our utmost toil, yet love and tranquil sleep Fulfilled the night with this beneath our pillow, And certain death at any moment ours. Lady S. And always then the sombre clouds dispersed, And fate began to build us up again. Sir T. We slept together . . . Lady S. Yes . . . Sir T. Well, we shall see. Lady S. [Takes up the book of the play and covers her eyes again] I see the theatreâwhat was Warwick's brag?â One tidal wave of wild humanity From stalls to gallery, surging at your feet, If Warwick Groom plays Troilus? Why that âifâ? Sir T. There's menace there! Lady S. Why can't I hear it say, âSince Warwick Groom plays Troilusâ? . . . Can't we die At once? If you would only care to die! I should be glad to die: I am very tired. Sir T. If failure rings the curtain down, perhaps That way as well as any. Lady S. Will you promise? Sir T. No; I'll not promise! A thousand things may chance. Lady S. A thousand things? Yes; should a foe of yours Or Warwick'sâTristram, they may drown his wits In all good fellowship! Then where are we? Will you not go and guard him? Sir T. Presently. I have a thing to settle in my mind. Lady S. May I go, Tristram? Sir T. If you think it well. Lady S. Oh, better than well, I think it. [Knocking. Not for me I hope. [Opens the door] What? Who? The Bishop of St. James's! Sir T. St. James's! Comeâcome in! Enter Gervase Sackville, Bishop of St. James's. I thought the east Had held you captive for another month. St. J. I finished what I gave myself to do In half the time I judged the work would take. Lady S. Oh, welcome, Gervase! Like a single sorrow You come to bless us: wonder at my words; They have the sweetest meaning. Fortune comes With Gervase, Tristramâhow, I cannot tell: Or short, or long, it comes: I feel it here; But yet I go to guard the ark. St. J. The ark? Lady S. The theatre, the play, the purseâour lives! [Goes out. St. J. My cousin's moody, Tristram. Sir T. I never thought To need a friend for the last rite of friendship, The revelation and unbosoming Of weakness. Had you come a day, an hour, Some heart-beats later, business, theatre, world, With permanent eclipse of insight, soul, Of something nameless yet, had spared you this That I am going to tell you. Will you sit, Or must you walk about? St. J. The highest mood Is stillest. [They sit.] Sir T. Still as death! I loved my wife, And she loved me: she loves me strangely yet In some dispassionate absorbing way That tortures her. I do not love her now; And why I know: we have no children. St. J. What! Sir T. There must be fruit of love, if love's to last. St. J. Now you perplex me, Tristram. Sir T. There were children: You christened fourâand buried them. Ah, yes; If they had lived! St. J. If they had lived? What then? Sir T. Profound affection for the hallowed womb That gave my passion form and brought to light Its ecstasy in boys and girls of mine: Desire had changed to deep affection then; But often now I loathe this childless woman, And think with horror how she knows my heart, My tendernesses, selfishnesses, thoughts Inchoate, wanton follies, baby talk: My wife became my mistress in the end. St. J. Oh now I see into the depths of it! Sir T. When our last child had died and she and I Were raw with grief, unhinged by wild despair, A fount and flame of lust arose in both, As though we had eaten of some forbidden fruit, Or swallowed magic earth, or been bewitched, Or drenched with aphrodisiac. At the time My fame was in the nadir, and our lives' Duration insignificant to us: So every night with poison in a vial Beneath our pillow to end it when we chose, A letch that never seemed to sate itself Drained us of all humanity; but I, Refined and tempered in the heat and cold, Desire and languor, languor and desire, The rhythm of this, by natural sorcery Became at last an artist: think of it! I found myself the master of the mood, Enchanting folk and playing on their nerves As though an audience were a zither; made A name far-sounding; and, by your goodwill, Am nowâHeaven save the mark, the banal end!â Am now, Sir Tristram Sumner, nominal, As well as actual theatrocrat. St. J. Do I speak now? Sir T. Not yet. A jealousy More sombre than my hateâa thing to note, That love is never jealous of the pastâ A sombre jealousy begot by hate Began to whisper âStrike her; wound her; kill.â St. J. Your wife and I are cousins. Sir T. Therefore I speak. She has no kin but you to help her now. Shall I go on? St. J. Go on. Sir T. My first of friends Was Warwick Groom. Upon my marriage-morning This letter came:ââDo you know that Warwick Groom and Martha Sackville were lovers? She visited him every night in his dressing-room at the Parthenon when he played Romeo; and the reason why he insisted on beginning the fourth act with the fifth scene of the third act was the reason you guess at once: it gave them time. But that was not the only place in the play where they performed their private intermede. How this was managed? Ask old Odham, Groom's dresser.â St. J. Malicious, were it not so impotent. Sir T. Perhaps so; but I kept it. St. J. So I see. Whom have you shown it to? Sir T. To none but you. St. J. Burn it. Sir T. [Placing the letter in his pocket again] I can't; I feel it tells the truth. St. J. Never believe it, Tristram! Martha Sackville, Stately and unapproachable, and chaste As fire and snowâwhatever Martha Sumner May be now. Sir T. The wantonest women veil Their lust with dignity; or knowing it not, Feel it, and are constrained and awkward: broach It once, then lechery rushes out unstopped Byâ St. J. Hush! Why have you told me this? Sir T. Adviceâ I want advice. St. J. Tell me the rest. Sir T. I thought For half an hour when this came, reasoning thus: âMartha is chaste: against my eyes and ears âThat I will die forââI was deep in love. âAnd if she dropped a stitch, what's that to me? âWomen are sensual, full of seed like men; âBut me she lovesâa different fire from that âUneasy prurience wondering girls and boys âAlike give facile way to, now and then. âHave I no past? If she has hers, we both âBegin the world anew.â And best and worst This Odham died upon my marriage-day. St. J. What kind of man was he? Sir T. A wastrel, prime And perfect; a vocationâgenius for it: A parson's son, of course: acted himself A while, then fell to dressing unperturbed. He died of alcohol.âWe played a week,â He, Romeo, I, Mercutio; failed and lost Three thousand pounds or so. But he and I Were marked and sought for. Of the two I think Groom was the abler actor, and certainly Beyond comparison popular. Bidding high After my marriage I declined to play Except with mediocrities, having felt Rather than recognised, how much depends Upon the pathos of inequality, The very essence of the theatre. Groom was my rival in the public mind; Therefore I made my book against himâhe, Against me, doubtless, burrowing underground. Armed with advantage all unknown to himâ 'Varsity, Policy, ChurchâI kept him out Wherever I came in: not difficult Without advantage even, he being then As now, his own worst enemy, debauched And drunken, with relapses of remorse. In one relapseâ St. J. Relapse! Sir T. âhe stormed the town; Then failed and failed again; while I became The representative actor of my time. My fame is rooted in his infamy: Especially in his; and in the fame Eclipsed of every actorâwhich to me Would be the blackest infamy. St. J. So harsh! Sir T. Truth, Gervase; it's the truth; no pleasure, power, Glory, applause, but strikes its cancerous roots Deep in the hearts of men; for what is fame But envy by a virtuous title saved From dying of chagrin, transmuted echo Of curses and of sighs! St. J. Come to the crux. Sir T. I hate my wife. She forces Warwick on me To play the part of Troilus. Suddenly The nebulous past contracts to this: my wife Was Warwick's mistress before she married me; And I could kill them both. What must I do? St. J. You must not kill them, and you must deny That Martha was Warwick's mistress: deny it now. Sir T. Deny the roundness of a woman's limbs, Deny the sexes and that blood is red! Well, I deny it, since I have no proof. What next? St. J. A simple thing. I long have thought That marriages should end when love is deadâ On either side: the marriage vow should be âTill love is dead,â not âtill death do us partâ; And sacrament might end it solemnly, As it began. The Church is backward there: Its grip might fasten on the world again If once divorce became a sacrament. Sir T. Divorce? St. J. Do you remember how I pled Against your marriage? Sir T. I remember. St. J. Judged My hidden purpose snobbish I suppose? Sir T. I thought there underlay your argument A dread of misalliance. St. J. Wrong: my plea Was candid. I maintained and still maintain The artist should be celibate; a priest Exempt from human ties. Sir T. I think so too; Though when I married Martha I desired Experience of the noble cares of life, As the true discipline and academe Of art. How foolish! how insane! for art Is like religion, only undefiled In perfect freedom and abandonment. St. J. You hang upon a verge of perilous truth: Religion is the very art of art. But that can wait: I have much to say on that.â I hold it deadly sin, if anything Is to be christened sin, for you and her To live together longer, love being dead. I counsel you to leave her; and I myself, Who married you, will privately pronounce A precept of divorce. Sir T. But Martha's fate? St. J. Her life will be most beautiful: refined By loveâby lust that purifies the soul More certainly than any chastisement; Disordered by the loss of all her childrenâ A doom that makes the deeds done in the flesh Pernicious to the mind, to fancy noisome; She shall become a perfect bride of Heavenâ Bride of the Universe. Sir T. Gervaseâhow strange! You counsel separation? St. J. Before the law; Before the Universe, divorce. Sir T. Again, The Universe! St. J. News that can wait a while. Sir T. And I should be the minister of art, Unfettered by a single private tie, A public votary. Yes; but how? the means? Who will provide for Martha? And myself! Who will provide for me? The day we part, My creditors and hersâthey ruin us. St. J. And that is grave; yet may be overcome. Sir T. But what a sordid hell we welter in! Art is inhuman, Gervase. St. J. Yes, all art, And all religion and the life of man: Inhuman, Tristram. Is it news to you? Sir T. Then is there no humanity in men? St. J. None, Tristram; none! Humanity! a dream Phantasmal as divinity itself. Sir T. Humanity, divinityâideals? Do you believe in nothing, Gervase? St. J. No. BeliefâBut that can wait. Sir T. Wait! what can wait? That is your cry to-day. What, and till when? Is it a revelation? St. J. Now you laugh; And that is sane and good: the bitterest grin Is hopeful. What I have to say can wait UntilâWhy do you reproduce to-night This decadent, mordant, hateful travesty? Sir T. âTroilus and Cressidaâ? It is my mood: Man as he isâand woman. Oh, I stalk A theory here! Heaven help us, and the cat! I play Ulysses. [The telephone rings. St. J. Shall I go? Sir T. [At the telephone] No, Gervase! What are you dubious of? (Yes. Martha! Well? Groom? Drinkingâdrunk. How horrible? No. Yes.) I'm ruined, Gervase! Martha saw and heard Our fate to-night in that magnetic mood She will solicit. (Yes. I come at once.) We conquer if Warwick Groom plays Troilus; If not our curtain's down, our lights are out, My last part played. [Both have reached the door hurriedly and are about to go out. St. J. Not though your bitterest foe Is satisfied to-night: for âfortune comes âWith me.â So said your prophetess. Sir. T. She did! The day is young: the thing may be retrieved. When shall I see you? St. J. After the play. Sir T. Till then? St. J. I also have my art. Sir T. You in your church, I in my theatre. St. J. One purpose serve?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene: The stage of the Grosvenor Theatre, set for the first act of âTroilus and Cressida.â Warwick Groom as Troilus and Silas Orchard as Pandarus are seated in the entrance to Priam's castle. Each has a bottle of wine and a silver drinking-cup, and Groom is turning over a book of the play. Abbot, Salerne, Actors and Scene-shifters, at the back and in the wings. Lady Sumner passes at the back, wringing her hands. Groom. PandarâPrince Pandarus of Troy!âwhy you, You are the very spirit of the stage! Orchard. You mean the part I play, not me myself. Groom. What other meaning could I have? You are The part you play, and nothing else besides. Orchard. Now there you're wrong; I'm very much myself. Groom. There's not a dozen actors in the town Who can be anything but the part they play. You are a glove, my prince, fit or misfit: Suave to the fingers like a second skin; Pushed on with wetted index, grunt, grimace; Or like the gauntlet of a dwarf that splits Upon a giant's thumb. Orchard. And so are you! Groom. So they would make me; but I'll be a handâ As I have been. This play was made for meâ For Troilus; and I'll have the business changed, Prince Pandarus of Troy. What kind of ape Was he that played your Troilus? Heavens!âA glove Would have rebelled. The whole rehearsed and drilled For Cressida, Ulysses, Hector, Helen! And Troilusâin the book at blood-heatâstuck In the shade to freeze; cut, mangled, hanged, drawn, quartered! I'll have my lines restored, my scenes rehearsed According to their import. Pandar, room, By your leave, for Troilus! Stand, Diomed! Unmanned abortion, bowelless coward, stand! Prince Pandarus of Troy, you are the stage, The inner spirit and the outward man. For what's the theatre but a splendid bawdâ A little passive recreation pitched To span the abyss from dinner time till supper; To season minds of maidens and of wives With spice of marriage and adultery; The shoeing-horn of whoredom and the nest Of cuckolds. [Abbot comes down with Salerne and several scene-shifters. Abbot. Nowâ Groom. Avaunt, Sir Abbot! Fly! Abbot. Sir Tristram may be any instant here. Now, will you go, or must we help you? Groom. Go? Go where? Abbot. To your dressing-room. Groom. But I am dressed. Abbot. The last time:âWill you go? Groom. When I have played My scene. Abbot. Quick, men; away with him. Groom. [Beating them off with his sword] Away With you. D'ye take me for a property, Thrice sodden shifters? Abbotâfriar John, Go, mop your tonsure. Skip about! Shift, shift, Inevitable vermin of the stage! Abbot. By God, sir, you'll remember this! You cur! Groom. You'll not forget it either, business bug! Your discounts, claims, commissions, premiumsâha! My unjust steward, we must cork it in, This honest indignation, righteous bile, The rancour lacing all our thoughts, or else, By rent and vent, the lining of our pokes, Like treacherous entrails, Judas' viscera To wit, may fundamentally escape, And leave us poorer than we were before. Go downâto the box-office! Abbot. Thank the lord, Sir Tristram! Enter Sir Tristram Sumner. 'Twas not my fault, at all; I did my best. They treated him; he treated them: the wine's Above the tide-mark, and the fat in the fire. Sir T. Orchard? Orchard. Oh, very well, Sir Tristram! Off I go. Send for me if you want me: none Shall say that Silas Orchard overstayed His welcome. [Goes out. Sir T. Send a line to Orchard's rooms: See that the messenger is there before him: No man in England can play the part like him. [Abbot and Salerne, etc., go out. Now what's the matter, Warwick? Groom. This gutted play! You've cut the very things I want to say. Here in my first scene comes your pruning-hook, Your harvester, and shears my poppied patch:â âHer bed is India; there she lies, a pearlâ:â Why man, it's poetry: I want to say it. Then hereâ Sir T. Yes, yes; but this? Why this? You make My theatre a pothouse. Groom. Pothouse? [Drinks] Why, Your theatre's well enough to drink in, Knight. Knight? Vain, deluded, damned theatrocrat! Sir T. What, Warwick! What! Groom. An actor knighted! Once The actor was an artist here in England. When England in Queen Bess's time became A world above the world, and felt itself Adult and masculine, then lightly came The actor and the act, outside the state, Authentic and alone. Sir T. Enough of that! We know your fantasies. Will you attempt The part; or are you spoiled for this time, Warwick? Groom. I'll speak this matter out. When plays were damned By churchmen, and the player a citizen Of rascaldom on sufferance living only, Great was the stage, a lover of all life, The friend of sinners and the home of sin, A city of refuge for humanity Escaping from religion and the curses Of the law; for church and stage are deadly foes; They can be strong only in enmity; And both were shrines of art when either shunned The other, or met in battle: now that they mix, Illicit lovers and against the lust Of nature, sterile hybrids mock their couch; And soon the lofty strain of either ends In mere abortion. When the monarch set The lethal signet on the theatre Of gross respectability, knighting you, Sir Tristram, and other players unfortunate, Ranking you in the state with grocers, brewers, Distillers, lawyers, painters, aldermen, He dealt a double blow at church and stage And both are bleeding from the wound. Sir T. Why this To meâme specially? Groom. Because you haunt The clergy, and the clergy fawn on you, Singling you out: the Bishop of St. James's Is fast your friend: and nonconformistsâHell! Have sung your praise in public. I maintain The stage must stand alone like all things great, Unspotted of the church, the state, the world. Sir T. You try my patience. This is soâall this, And endless matter to a like intent. Groom. But who has grasped the meaning? who perceives That these luxurious theatres of ours Are only living gravesâthe ornate tomb Of drama? Sir T. I perceive it. Hopeful men Are always digging graves unwittingly; Cathedralsânoble cenotaphs of faith Long dead: academiesâof plastic art The tomb; our ancient universitiesâ The mausoleum and the monument Of learning; justice in the law-courts buried Lies most worshipfully; soon our sculptured banksâ To make an endâwill be the sepulchre Of all finance: is not the whole world bankrupt? Groom. Turn it to ribaldry! I love the stage, And hate to see it made the prostitute Of crafty godliness that's mainly thisâ The rancid odour of a worn-out sex. To see the stage that should be sweet, humane, More tolerant than art, freer than sinâ Let me say sin to mean all human scope, The utmost license of unbridled mirth, The noble freedom of the tragic mood, A perfect liberty of drift and range, The universal mind and deed of man: To see the stage corrupted by the church, Debauched by bland religion, venomous Betrayer of the spirit; and foul with creed, The helpless necessary excrement Wherewith religion sullies everything: To see this loathsome doom of what I love Is deadlier to me than blank despair, Than death and everlasting obloquy. Sir T. To me it means the element I use, For church and stage are dramaturgy both: The one inspires a happy will to death; The other floods the soul of man with life. If you must carp against the stage, attack The usury that leads it on a chain, Exploiting all that's base: there's loads of gold In flattered meannesses; the public pays To be degraded: easiest escape Is downward to the abyss; the greasy plank Requires no effort. Groom. Tristram of the times, The creature of infectious decadence That triumphs everywhere: a harvest home Of mellow, putrid autumns; afternoon And twilight of the state, the church, the stage. By heaven and earth, the syndicated shows That pay the big percentages are sweet Beside a gelded Shakespeare, and the priest Pronouncing benediction from the stalls! Sir T. The decadence is everywhere?âperhaps; But how should that concern the decadents? Their function is to hasten the decay. It has been held, it has been proved that life Is but the decadence of matter, soul The decadence of life; now, soul itself, The parasite that drains the sap of life, Begins its decadence. But what of that? We must go through with it.âCome, will you play Prince Troilus, boy; or, flatly, are you drunk? Groom. [Drinks] I cannot tell; perhaps: I love to drink: The dingy world becomes a crystal orb Revealing truth when wine enlightens meâ Truth like a sumptuous vision in a bell Of dew, a magic bubble blown to film That melts and bursts, a passion of delight, A shimmering womb of diverse stains and deep. By Bacchus and his panthers, I believe A great career of drunkenness were worth A man's ambition! Alcohol's as good As law, the church, the army, or the stage! Henceforth my business and my art will be To drink and to be drunken. [Drinks] Odours faint Of pallid wayside roses, heavier scents Of roses of the garden, deeper snares Of bowls of roses ripe and faded, bowls Of leaves of roses, faded, dark and sweet, The last aroma! Clusters of the vine, Mature, deep-bosomed, umbered with the sun; Old dregs and essences of happiness, Of women's pulses wound like springs of steel, Of sanguine wars, of sinews, swords, of hearts As hard as nether millstones, burning love Like molten adamant! Oh, heaven and hell Are wed and wanton in a cup of wine, Bouquet and ichor of eternity! I shall go out and cry it in the streets. Sir T. [To the Actors in the wings] Go with him to his room. Let him drink on Until he sleeps. That is the end of this. [Groom goes out, accompanied by the Actors. Lady S. [Coming down quickly] And this the end for us, Sir Tristram. Drink. Sir T. [Taking the vial which Lady Sumner offers] Are you insane? You have not drunk? Lady S. Not yet. Here on your stage we two must die togetherâ An ever famous tragedy of art In this uncouth commercial age of ours. I hear it still: âIf Warwick Groom plays Troilus.â He cannot play it nowâpoor Warwick Groom! Ambiguous poison in that âifâ; but death Will end all ambiguity. Tristram, drink. Sir T. Your eyes are wandering, pale and beggarly; Your voice is phantom-like, far off and chill: Martha, you have gone mad. Lady S. We both were mad; But I am sane at last: I cannot live. Be sane, and drink. Sir T. Not here, not now, not ever. Lady S. Not? But defeat is here, is everywhere; Behind the scenes, in front, and in our hearts. You promised me a hundred thousand times You never would survive defeat. Sir T. We loved Each other then; and were you now to say, âIf failure rings the curtain down to-night, âLet us two, having loved each other well, âHaving discharged ourselves of all our love, âDie in each other's armsâ, I should assent; Forget these years of dull estrangement; snatch You off to Venice or Palermo; end Defeat and triumph, and the world and time In one superb and golden aftermath, A full-eared harvest-moon of winnowed love. Lady S. Your words are like a smoky gust of heat Across a wilderness of snow! Shame! shame! Sir T. I cannot love where I am not beloved, And will not die to please an unloved wife. Lady S. But I do love you, Tristram! Love you? Oh, Did I not give you all the love I had? I love you now with something more than love; And never shall I rest until my dust, Cold, senseless, passionless, inanimate, Divinely rotted into virgin mould, Is mixed with yours to all eternity. Sir T. A deadly loveâthat has the ring of hate! Lady S. It is a kind of hate. I cannot live! I cannot live! I cannot let you live! Remember, Tristram, how like frantic beasts We toiled at love. Oh! . . . Oh! . . . How long I fought This grinding passion of remorse, how strove To deem the noxious beautiful! A fan Against a storm! The wind is up; my boat Beats on the breakers; all is swamped and lost. Sir T. But beauty sanctioned all our frantic love. Sometimes a moment's nauseaâyes, sometimes I shudder when I think; but hurl it off Because I know the meaning: I am tired, Depressed, too solitary; or forget To eat, absorbed in study: food and wine Replenish all my powers, and straightway sex Becomes the purest wonder in the world. Lady S. My sex is dead: it dies in women, sex. I sinned; my life was sin; and since the power To sin is dead, the sinner must die too. Sir T. But I have still the power, the will to sin. Lady S. How hateful! Oh, how hateful! Tristram, think! Failure, defeat, disgraceâcertain, to-night: I see it, feel it, know it; and never yet Has my delivered mood brought back to me A lying message. Better instant death! Sir T. But fortune came with Gervaseâso you said. Lady S. I felt a sudden lifting of despair When Gervase came; but that was death: he brought Religion, resignation, denial, death. Oh, we must die! Conceive what failure means! Eyes of commiseration, scornful lips, Emphatic pressure of a pitying hand, Thrice gracious bows, and triple-hatted shrugs, Sugared contempt, and rancour heavy-spiced Must never greet us, Tristram: we must die. You would not have our special enemy, The whipper-in of anti-Sumnerites, In print and prattle triumph nauseously? Sir T. A change, by heaven! Are you not she who held No jargon ever writ or babbled hurt An artist or an artist's wife? Lady S. I did, Being sick and sore and wounded to the quick: Who talks of jargon says âmy soul is stungâ. The mask is off, Sir Tristram. I'm going to die; And mean to tell the truth right on from now Until we drink that draught together. Choose: A flood of truth about the world and us, Or death immediately. Let it be death. The pain it is to me to live! Oh, Tristram! Sir T. I mean to live; and so do you. Defeat Is not so sure: at least, my own success Is certain always, though the play may failâ As plays have failed before and will again. Lady S. Not this time: you will fail: you will be hissed! Sir T. Martha! Lady S. I saw and heard: I hear it now. The long hiss from the gallery like a scourge, A skilful hiss that flicks the proper sore: You only, not the play. Your race is run; Come, be a man and die. After to-night What life is ours? First, bankruptcy: the court, Exposure of our choice extravagance, That seemed so needful to our finer souls; The sale of our belongings next, friends, foes Bidding for things that are a part of us: Oh, I would just as soon walk naked down The Strand, as have my skirts and linen tossed And fingered by the women-folk I know! Give me the poison if you will not drink; I'll die alone. Give it me, when I ask! Will you not give it me? And afterwardsâ Oh afterwards! The provinces! What said Poor Warwick? I remember: âStations, inns âProvincial companies and theatres, âThe dismallest labyrinth where every step âStumbles at skeletons of dead ambitions!â Give me my vial, Tristram; give it me. Sir T. You know the play will fail! you hear that hiss? Lady S. Nothing is surer. Sir T. Then we must not die, For should we die we make your vision vain. Lady S. How can you jest! Oh, hateful! Oh, unkind! Sir T. Not so: I say your augury mistakes; I challenge you to live and find it false. Lady S. You know it is not false. I speak the truth, Nothing but truth! Sir T. Why, then, an intermede! Had I your maidenhead? Lady S. Ahâhâh! Sir T. Tell the truth. Lady S. Unholy beast! give me the poison, quick! I want to die; I want to die alone! Sir T. That might be well; but not just now, nor here. Lady S. I wonder . . . Could I drown myself? Alone? Sir T. Salerne! Salerne! [Goes out. Re-enter Salerne. The understudy's dressed? Salerne. He is. Sir T. And Groom? Asleep? Salerne. As sound as Noah. Sir T. Have him sent home. Salerne. The other principals? Sir T. Detain them still. I must rehearse the play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene: Sir Tristram Sumner's Reception-room in the Grosvenor Theatre. At the back a door opens into a business-room. On the left is the Dressing-room. The entrance to the Reception-room is on the right. Hildreth is writing at a table when the act begins. Enter Abbot. Hildreth. What? Is the curtain down? Abbot. Not yet. Hildreth. The play? Abbot. Still-born: so dead a house I never saw. To-day's rehearsal sealed our doom. I pledâ I prayed him on my knees to touch no tone, No movement, entrance, exit, gesture, pause, Procession, picture, colour, light or shade; But that she-devil and walking-ghost, his wife, Had roused a deadlier devil in him: our chief Undoes a month's fine artistry in three Sick hours of mischief. Hildreth. I've seen the thing before: Rehearsal is the purgatory of plays; It fits them for beatitude; but turn Rehearsal into hell, then farewell heaven. Abbot. A pin-prick does it. Enter Salerne. Well, SalerneâHeaven, hell, And purgatory, what's the matter, man? Why, you're as grey as putty! Salerne. Where were you? Abbot. When? Salerne. When the curtain fell. Abbot. I sheltered here. I'm barometric: I predicted frost, And feared I might catch cold. Salerne. Your death of cold. The chief was hissed. Abbot. Sir Tristram Sumner hissed? Impossible! Hildreth. He was not hissed! Salerne. He was. A solitary hiss at first; and then The gallery caught it up and let it loose, Like gas escaping from an old-time batten. Abbot. But was it meant for him? Salerne. Straight at his head And not a hand to drown it. Hildreth. No applause? Salerne. Before the hiss a little civil noise, But not a cry, no cheer, no name, no call. Hildreth. Why did he come before the curtain then Salerne. Fatuitous: his instinct failed him quite. Abbot. He thought his personality might win A vote of confidence against the play. Salerne. That was his hope, no doubt. Ah, here he comes! Enter Sir Tristram Sumner as Ulysses. His dresser, Temple, follows him, carrying a portmanteau, which he sets on a chair. While Sir Tristram is changing he sometimes stands in the doorway of his dressing-room and sometimes speaks from within. Temple takes from the portmanteau Sir Tristram's evening dress and goes into the dressing-room. Sir T. Who had the gallery to-night? Abbot. A man Appointed yesterday. Sir T. A novice? Abbot. No, Sir Tristram; from the Parthenon. Sir T. A soldier?â The tables and the wine? Is all prepared? Salerne. Yes; everything. Sir T. See that they set it out Courageously.â [Salerne goes out. A soldier, did you say? Abbot. In Egypt and the Transvaal. Sir T. Intelligent? Abbot. I think he is. Sir T. Send for him [Abbot goes out. Letters, Hildreth? Ah, what are these? The bank, the law. No stamp; Not posted; sent by hand. Hildreth. An hour ago. Sir T. Well, we have scorned such documents before. Set them aside unopened.âDid you hear? Hildreth. Hear? No. Sir T. They hissed me, Hildreth. Hildreth. Glad I am I did not hear. Sir T. The foulest, meanest sound, The hatefullest! How nauseous men can be! I think I sooner would be hissed than hiss. The paltriness, the impotence of one Who hisses! It hurts; it kills: a hiss can kill: I think a hiss could kill. A curious thing, That impotence should have the power to kill! A strange beast, man! [The telephone rings. Hildreth. [At the telephone] Mark Belfry wants to see you. Sir T. Oh! . . . Let him come. Hildreth. [At the telephone] (Yes. Now.) Sir T. I needed thisâ To be well hissed: a shower-bath for the soul: It strengthens me. An actor can't be great? I think he can. Enter Mark Belfry. Well Belfry, how are you? Belfry. In health, Sir Tristram. Sir T. Have you come to buy The theatre? Belfry. I have. Sir T. It's not for sale. Belfry. It will be soon. Sir T. As soon as I am dead. Belfry. What are you going to do? Sir T. This lasts a week. To-morrow I rehearse an old success. Belfry. And after that? Sir T. I cannot tell. Belfry. I can. Sir T. Predict. Belfry. I shall provide you with a play. Sir T. Never! Belfry. I take the risk. Sir T. No name but mine Shall flourish on my bills whilst I am here. I hate your Yankee style, your affectation: âPresents Sir Tristram Sumner!â No, Mark Belfry! Belfry. That I forego. I want your theatre. Yes; I mean to have it. Any kind of hold To start with! Oh, I'll own the Grosvenor yet! I fight in the open. I'll finance you; flood Your desert, for I guess your Nile's dried up; I'll gild the wolf's clean teeth, and flesh them too, With prime American dentistry. No name But yours; and no condition but my play. It gallops hard at home; there's money in it; A part to fit you; colours, crowds and kings. It's curious how it came to be, this play. One of your poets wrote upon commissionâ Sir T. For you? Belfry. For me. Sir T. A poet, Belfry! Belfry. Well, The sketch was good; I liked it and the man. The play was good, tooâbetter than the stuff We're acting; but I saw how out of it, Instead of something that would crown his fameâ Sir T. The poet's? Belfry. Yes, the poet's! Out of his play, That might have been a stage-mark for a brace Of centuries or so, I saw there could be shaped A popular success to overrun The English-speaking world for just two years, Extract a ton of money, and be forgotten For ever after: which is what we want. Sir T. Indubitably. Belfry. A commodious hack I keep, transferred the scene, the folk, to Spain From England, changed the age, and vulgarized The whole. The trick was done; the money flows. Sir T. And what about the poet? Belfry. He trusted me; He has no claim. Sir T. I think the lawâ Belfry. We all Risk that. Sir T. You shameful Yankee salesman! Play Your tricks elsewhere. Belfry. Don't hear you; business first. Sir T. I've some here to attend to. Will you join The others on the stage? No? Well; good night. Belfry. I'll have your theatre yet! [Goes out. Sir T. Never. Good night. Re-enter Abbot with Boulder. Are you the gallery? Boulder. I am, Sir Tristram. Sir T. What did it? Is there anything to tell? Boulder. There is, Sir Tristram. Sir T. Tell it, please. Boulder. Before The curtain fell I saw a woman's head, A lady's, on the stair. Sir T. What do you mean? Boulder. It seemed to rest upon the topmost step From where I stood and watched. Abbot. The lady climbed No further than the middle of the stairâ That's what he means, I think. Her head Appeared just in the entrance. Boulder. My meaning, sir. The palest face I ever saw: her eyeballs Turned about and showed the whites; she gasped For breath and drew a deep one. While I watched, Wondering what might be right, her eyes came down, Dull, dead, and horrible, and she hissed like hell. Then everybody hissed. I hissed myself. I beg your pardon: I could no more keep From hissing than I could from crying out When once a dervish stabbed me at Khartoum. The gallery felt the same; I asked those near What set them on it, and they said they heard A hideous hiss that made them hiss like hell. Sir T. So. And the lady? Boulder. Vanished into space. Sir T. Or down the stair. You knew her? Boulder. No, Sir Tristram. Sir T. Of course; your first night here. Boulder. I couldn't help The hissing. Like something in a battle, hiss It went and everybody hissed. Sir T. No need To trouble; I conceive the thing. Boulder. We hissed Because we couldn't help it. Sir T. Say the word Again, and I'll hiss too! Good night, my man. Boulder. Good night, Sir Tristram. [Goes out. Sir T. Hildreth, Abbot; come.â About this lady not a word remember.â I'll ask you something; did you ever see A woman's soul? Hildreth. I never did, Sir Tristram. Sir T. Abbot? Salerne. Nor I. Sir T. And never may you need to! Once on a time I saw a woman's soul. I looked and looked, expecting colours, flowers, A perfume and an opal. I found instead A sooty cobweb diapered with limbs And empty hulls of captives long undone. I shook it, but the spider made no sign: It, too, was dead. I brushed the film away, And where it hung a mortal crevice yawned, Obscene and dark and barren as the grave.â How late it is! My guests will all be gone. Come, quickly.âProphecies fulfil themselves. [The three go out. Temple re-enters from the Dressing-room, packs the clothes Sir Tristram had been wearing during the day, closes the portmanteau and goes out. Enter Blyth, carrying a lady's hat and clothes. He looks about, and then beckons at the door of the Reception-room. Enter Europa Troop, as Cressida. Blyth. [Pointing to the Business-room] In there. Europa. Turn up the light. [Blyth lights up the Business-room. A smell of leather; Ledgers; business-smell; red ink and copying-inkâ The faintest spice: I feel them in the air. Turn out the light. [Blyth extinguishes the light in the Business-room. The smells are out as well. I saw the books, the pots. Turn up the light. [Blyth lights up the Business-room. The smells again. The senses, Blyth, are glued Together. Did you ever see a smell? Blyth. Fumes? Europa. Oh, yes!âfumes. Now Blyth, is this correct? Won't Abbot and his clerks be here again? Blyth. That's not the counting-house. Sir Tristram's own. Europa. Sir Tristram's own? Blyth. His private business-room. Europa. This is the most palatial theatre! Dispose my thingsâthere, on the roll-top desk. [Blyth does so. I'll risk it, Blyth. [Gives Blyth money. Blyth. [Counting the money] One short. You promised five. Europa. [Gives a fifth sovereign] I know I did. I thought you'd let me off. Blyth. You'll know me better next time. Europa. That's the style! We can collaborate. Blyth. What are you getting at? What do you want to know? Europa. I'll tell you, Blyth. I want to know what makes this theatre feel Uncanny. All the time I'm like a ghost Astray in some mirage. Blyth. A plump one, lady; A very handsome one. Europa. Thanks, Blyth; I'm fit. I'll tell you something else, because I like you: I want to take possession of Sir Tristram; I have it in me, Blyth. What do you think? Blyth. Sir Tristram's married and a gentleman. Europa. And I'm an actress: an actress, do you see? And furthermore, and most, there's not a crowd Of actresses in London, or in the world. Blyth. A many actresses have tried it on. Europa. And all have failed, and all were bound to fail; But every one prepared Europa's path. Blyth. Sir Tristram's reputation's not that kind. He's most respectable in every way: The clergy patronize him. Europa. I know all that.â Well, kiss me, Blyth; my cheek. You're handsomer Than Tristram. What! Are you respectable? Blyth. No; but the money. I stick to that, you know. Europa. Oha! Ohe! Why, there's another lot; [Gives him money and kisses him. And this for being so smart a simpleton. You're mine, remember; body and soul, you're mine. Blyth. I'm yours. Europa. Now hurry, Blyth, or you'll be missed. [Blyth goes out. And I'll be mistress here, or know who is. Blyth, Blyth! Come back! Re-enter Blyth. Blyth. For God's sake, not so loud! Europa. Some day, I'll shout.âWhat do they think of me? You heard them pass remarks. Blyth. I heard them say Europa's just the best thing in the show. Europa. That's what I like to hear! Dear Blyth! Be off! [Blyth goes out. The best thing in the showâEuropa just, Who caught and held Sir Tristram's eyes to-day Until he fathomed hers. I think we said, If looks can speak, âI'm ready when you like.â A footstep and a skirt. Sir Tristram's wife? [Closes the door, leaving it ajar. Turns out the light in the Business-room. Enter Lady Sumner. Opening the portmanteau she searches her husband's pockets. Lady S. Is this the place? No; better in the house; Best in his bed; the moment he comes home! Oh, beautifully done to drink it there And then! And with my dying breath to curse My husband for a coward that killed my soul, And feared himself to die. I'm not afraid. After I'm dead I'll come to life again, And tell him what he asked; and when I'm dead Indeed, my wraith will haunt him, whispering still The thing he asked: who had my earliest kiss Of love; who woke my heart and strung my soul To ecstasy he withered with his lust. I'll hiss it nightly in his waking ear; Torture him too with dreams. Not every night; But now and then to wear him out with doubt: I'll madden him and kill him patiently. [She finds the letter as well as the vial. What faded letter's this? [Reads] âDo you know that Warwick Groom and Martha Sackville were lovers? She visited him every night in his dressing-room at the Parthenon when he played Romeo; and the reason why he insisted on beginning the fourth act with the fifth scene of the third act was the reason you guess at once: it gave them time. But that was not the only place in the play where they performed their private intermede. How this was managed? Ask old Odham, Groom's dresser.â He must have known The day he married me! My head will burst! âShe visited him every night in his dressing-room.â He knew this and he married me! My soul It is that struggles in my wasted womb, And cannot be brought forth but by my death, A still-born soul and posthumous, since God Is not! I have been nothingâworse than nothing: A bed-mate, a convenience! Hell, hell, hell! [Goes out. Europa. [At the door of the Business-room] If I could act like that! But good, my luck! Sweet luck and succulent! Dear luck of mine! Plumb in the prime-joint of their mystery sticks My fork! The venison's hung and high! I'll cut And come again! Soul? Talk of soul! Give me My will, my body and my clean-run brains, Me and my purposes! Sir T. [Without] I'll not go home To-night. Europa. Sir Tristram's voice! [Closes the door and turns out the light. St. J. [Without] What will you do? Enter Sir Tristram and St. James's. Sir T. Sleep at the club. Sit down awhile and talk. [Sir Tristram takes from a cabinet a spirit-frame, a syphon, and a box of cigars, and helps St. James's and himself. Sir Tristram reclines on a couch. St. James's remains on his feet throughout the scene, sometimes pacing, sometimes standing still. St. J. But should your wife be left alone? Sir T. For her, The safest way: she's bent upon my death, And while I keep alive she lives, I think. Best, too, for me. St. J. How is it best for you? Sir T. Because it's touch and go to live or die. My life's no prize to meâworth this cigar Perhaps; and when her stealthy whine assails Me, begging death, I'm tempted to the point. A little tenderness in her, a look Of womanhood, or honey in her voice, And there might then have been no play to-night, But love and endless sleep. That exit's closed: I could not die consorted with my wife, My resolute enemy. St. J. This sudden crashâ It jarred to-day alreadyâis strange in you, As my remembrance notes you. Sir T. There can be No reconcilement now. She prophesied To-night's disaster, and to make all sure Began the hissing on the gallery stairs. St. J. She didn't! Sir T. But she did: none other, she. St. J. How horrible! Sir T. Oh, worse than horrible! The woman whom I chose has now become A scaly leprosy about my life. St. J. That's damnable! No more of that! Your wife Is deeply in the right: your corpses only Could fill the breach that opens up between you: It is the grave that gapes. If you're to live It must be by divorce. Do you consent? Sir T. That also means the grave; for if we break Our home up, bankruptcy and ruin come: Indeed they're here already. Look at these. [Hands St. James's the two letters. St. J. [Having read one of the letters] That's nothing but a seeming urgent threat, And very vilely-civilly worded too: Lawyer and gentleman are synonyms, But the law's not a gentleman. [Having opened the second letter. What's this? Your bankers?âAh!ââand ifââ Sir T. Don't read it out. St. J. [Having read the second letter] If this is met you have a breathing-space? Sir T. I can go on again. St. J. Then this I'll meet. Sir T. Oh, Gervase! St. J. Not disinterested alone: Infinite things to talk of! First of all, Why do you set so small a price on life? You once were proud of your vocation, knew The meaning of the theatre, felt its wide Domain. Sir T. Yes, but I know it now too well, Even as I know my wife and Warwick Groom. Let me not know you well, Gervase, not well: Show me the best in minims and in grams, But hide the bulk and flood in clouds of dawn, In silvery mists, the nimbus and the shrine Of air and sky: the soul should not be seen, Though mine be naked now. St. J. You suffer, Tristram. Naked your soul is, woundedâ Sir T. Flayed alive! Oh, Gervase, what a spirit of delight, Of fragrant hope, of fervent faith in men, I brought incarnate to the theatre! St. J. Full of vocation, I remember you: Chiefly in Wytham Wood one afternoonâ Sir T. Ah, how we beat our academic wings In woods, on hilltops, longing for the world And to take up our destiny! It took Me up, and laid me down, and racked and flayed With unremitting care. St. J. You held the stage To be the true adventure of the times. The earth was known, you said: if magic isles, Orchards of Hesperus; or queens asleep For centuries; or that supreme emprise, The middle passage of the maze of streams, Acheron, Phlegethon, Cocytus, Styx, And the return alive from Dis's hall Through groves of poplar, whispered madnesses, Obsequious willows, cries, the wild lament Of old companions, and the doleful shriek Of her, the best-belov'd, to utter woe Abandoned: had such high renown been still Achievable, then had you hoisted sail And led the way; but since the whole sad world Was now become mere shop and market-place, The stage remained the one way of escape, The one adventure for the adventurous. Sir T. I thought so; I believed so. But I found The most ignoble strife; a jug of asps, Where envy, vanity, avarice, wanton spite Torment and are tormented; with such a gloss Of tolerance and of fellowshipâhumour, tears, That soothe the grit of misery into pearl! St. J. Men cross to fortune on the stepping-stones Of ruined rivals; matter exploits us so; But which is better off, who triumphs most, The ruined or the ruiner? That's reserved. Sir T. I know, I know! And then the modern play! St. J. Let us not think it! Sir T. Only once it seems A people has a theatre. Drama leaps To instant being, power, supremacy: From âGorboducâ to âThe Tempestâ fifty years; And nothing since. Nor can it come again, Imagination being an outcast now, Unsceptred, unrefreshed, unclad, unknown In palace, hut, or hermitage: no home; A wandering bedlam. When the world believed In miracles of sorcery, potent drugs Alchemical, and constellated fate In heaven hung, then fancy had a lodgeâ St. J. All this is soâ Sir T. Be patient! Here I snatch A moment's ease, as in an interval Of torture. While the worn-out squaws repose, (Harpies or fiends: the laugh twists on my mouth!) Devising keener pangs, I hear again The fabulous music of the crystalline Accordant spheres; so let this perfume fade, Wind-wafted fragrance of a love-lorn scarf Bidding farewell for ever and a day. When elves and fairies haunted brakes and bowers, And gods and goddesses were visitors Hesternal at the latest; when Heaven and Hell Was as a casket closed about the earth, The universal jewel; and man himself The awful judge of angels and the mate Of God, worthy divine redemption, then There broke a drama great and beautiful Fresh from the dulcet brains and pregnant heart Of England. Soul was clad; the mind, informed; Imagination, armed, anointed, crowned; But now all naked, empty, abject, stripped And flayed! You understand? St. J. I understand. Men know there is no God, no Heaven and Hell: They welcomed that in secretâall who thought. But, God away, the Universe becomes A vacuum, and the welcome turns to cursing. They thought, âWe need no God; we have our art, âOur poetry: God is gone.â But all else went When God went: 'twas the breath of God that filled The pipe of Pan, the bosom and the sigh Of Aphrodite; goblins, loreleis, Enchantments, witchcraft, ghosts, transcendent deeds, Amazement, terror, beauty, rapture, tears, Intolerable passions, agonies Were of the warp and woof of God: God summed Imagination. Sir T. And there's no such God! St. J. No God to speak of: the idea of Godâ That's for the schoolmen: for the fatherless, The girls that drown their bastards, broken hearts, Incapables, incurables, castaways, Endurers, heroes, poets, artists, kings, Classes or masses, all who love their livesâ It helps them much to tell them of a God Evolving slowly in the mind of man! Sir T. But Christ, the man of sorrows? St. J. I never preach The man of sorrows now. . . . I grasp my theme: Give me your eye and ear, your heart and brain. Jesus of Nazarethâno, the Son of Man; Because this Jesus is a sloppy word, Mainly a sponge to wipe the tiresome tears Of foolish people. He, then, the Son of Manâ Sir T. But this you never preached in Westminster? St. J. Never directly; nor shall I preach it there. Not of the pulpit; of the stage, this theme Demands a crowded theatre and the mood Expectant, tyrannous of the gallery, not The mood submissive of the worshipper. Sir T. My nerves begin to tingle, telepaths Of coming wonder. Till I hear it all You shall not leave the theatre. [At the telephone] (Blyth, I stay Awhile. What do you say? What lady? Oh!â My wife went home! Yes, you may go. My key? I have it. True. Good night.) Now, Gervase, speak As if it were the judgment-day! St. J. It isâ It always is; and could we hear it peal, Each moment, heavy with eternal doom, Thunders in every heart. Sir T. Then speak to me As one about to die. St. J. I speak as one About to live! Sir T. To one about to live! St. J. This question like an automatic rack Seized me and stretched me: âWill you teach a lie?â âBehold,â I cried; âI have a tender heartâ âSoft-hearted am I; let a harder man âConfront this problem, lead the great revolt. âThough this of God and Sin and Heaven and Hell âBe now worn out, yet have I nothing new âTo traffic for it: let a stronger man âBecome protagonist and martyr; I âAlready faint: let this cup pass from me.â Oh it was good to say to broken heartsâ The faded women and the old worn menâ âCome unto me and I will give you rest.â Sir T. 'Tis easy comforting the poor with heaven, And those that never tasted delicate meats, Soft music, murmurs, vintages mature, And savoury ecstasy of man and woman. St. J. Kings, conquerors, artists, poets, power and wealth Demand a concrete heaven, just like the poor.â Still the rack wrenched me, âWill you teach a lie?â So tortured, I betook me to the east, The womb and cradle, nurse and school of thought, Of knowledge, poetry, religion, art. There in the desert, insufferable beams Their daily meaning smote through every sense; By night the deep immensity of heaven Revealed its wonder: all the centuries, The tattered stoles and finery of Time, Departed from me, and I knew myself Material in a Universe of pure Material substance, conscious mystery throned On the eternal moment that becomes For ever new. âThis is for me,â I thought: âEnough that one man once should so transcend: âLet the world now decay.â But the last pangs Of Hell laid instant hold on me and put Me to the question: âWill you teach a lie?â âWhat must I teach?â I cried. âTeach thou the truth,â The answer came, âthe pure, material truth; âBut firstly know the truth about the lie.â Sir T. What is the truth about it, Gervase? St. J. This:â That Christianity is the foe of life, Of health, of wealth, of intellect and strength; The friend of all the feeble, the diseased, The low, the loathsome, the depraved, the dirt, The offal of mankind. Instinctively the strong Laid hands upon it and wove imperial power Out of its filthy rags: a purple star Of high unchristian sovereignty in Rome; In England here an aristocracy Of brains and culture. Long they kept in check, The churchdoms did, with Hell and Heaven for sword And buckler, and a sense of sin to salt The wounds they dealtâhow long they kept in check Dynamic pressure of the Christian lie That men are equal in the sight of God! Sir T. Men are not equal, and there is no God. St. J. They are not equal, and there is no God. And when the myth of Heaven-and-Hellâthe valves Wherein the world lay like an oyster pearled With the soul of man: when this great fable gaped And fell away, the lethal meaning, hid In Christian tenets, like a serpent brood Uncoiled, as rancour, decadence, despair, In revolutions, anarchies, nihilisms, A will to end the world. There stand we now, Naked against the Universe. Sir T. The truth About the lie! The double carapace Of Heaven-and-Hell sloughed off, mankind remains A houseless mollusc. St. J. Pitiful to see! Imaginationâlet me use that word Instead of soul; and let it mean entire The powers of blood and nerve, of heart and brain, And aught occult and undiscovered yet In carnate matter: Imagination, not Conceiving what has happened in the world, Much wonders at the darkness and the cold. How simple, how appalling, how secure Were Heaven and Hell; what fathomless content In that deep home of penitential fire, That everlasting, joyful holiday In golden streets lit by the glory of God! Sir T. Will the great heart of the world be great enough To bid that dream avaunt once and for ever? St. J. It will, it must, though it should come with wars, Convulsions, burnings, tortures, massacres, With centuries of woe employing all Prodigious powers of slaughter, powers of pain, Wherein our civilized self-consciousness Outdoes barbarity and instinct far Beyond comparisons of Heaven and Hell. Sir T. With wars, with woes? You think the change will be A long elaborate travail? St. J. I cannot tell. Sir T. But God and Sin and Heaven and Hell that are not Are yet the very texture of the world. St. J. Kings, magistracies, warriors, learning, love Being knit in Heaven and Hell, in God and Sin, Like blood, nerve, sinew, bone in living flesh, It may be that the change will come about As human bodies alter in seven years timeâ Sir. T. In seven years' time! St. J. No, no; no prophecy! I mean the change may be a growth unfelt, Or else the whole world may collapse at once, (The rotten flesh unable to sustain The bones, enmesh the nerves, confine the blood) And cease to beâashamed to be Less than immortal and the special care Of God, Omnipotent, Omniscient; God, Lover, avenger, maker and destroyer. Sir T. No! man is greater than to make an end Because his God forsook him. St. J. I think so, too; And in my heart believe terrific war Will burst the chrysalis, the Christendom That hangs in rags about the eager soul, Already winged and rich with crimson stains, With sulphur plumes and violet, green and gold, Psyche at last, pure Matter of itself. Sir T. Psyche? Imagination. St. J. It was my word: Imagination be it! Sir T. Naked against A godless universe, with what, by whom Must we be clothed? St. J. Heaven, Hell and God and Sin Were but a symbol of the Universe, A lie wherein to wrap the babyhood Of man's imagination, which is itself The Universe become self-conscious. That's The whole; there is no more to say: with all The Universe, which is imagination Become in life a consciousness, in soul Self-conscious (still I say it, and again, And yet again it must be said): with all The Universe itself, no symbols now, Imagination must be clad and armed. Sir T. The terror and the splendour of it thrill Me through and through. I feel it: this is great; This is the greatest. St. J. Great and most terrible! I shrink, I quail; the burden weighs me down; The agony dissolves me: this is fear; This, mystery. Legends of creation, talesâ (As if the Universe could have been made In any sense mankind can give the word!) Fantastic myths of virgins bearing boys, And of a desperate God who gave his son To die upon a treeâhow foul a thing!â Of dead men come alive, and signs and shows Of tongues and thunders, cures and stigmata: These are no mystery, but the quaint alarm Of ignorance that harnessed vision against The things that be in sterile dreams of spirit, As banal, venomous-moral, hard and fast As Matter is mysterious, fluent, pure, Filling the Universe with miracle, Filling and being the Universe itself. Sir T. This makes my whole life horrible. St. J. Most lives, Confronting this, will shrivel into dust. Sir T. I've never lived. St. J. That is, you've never thought, Never imagined. Sir T. Never! A phantom life, The actor's; spell-bound drudgery chained And eyeless. What a ruthless tyrant public Opinion isâan armed automaton That fells its victims blindly! Entertain A motley audience for a livelihood You never make; be this, be thatâa fop, A fool, a hero, or a villain; lose Conceit of everything except applause; Be certain of success when self-contempt Assures you that you play a popular part; Be courteous to the bully, bland with foolsâ The dreadful folk that haunt celebrities, That haunt theatrical celebrities; Be genial with the newsmanâglad to see him; Civil to greedy playwrights, artists, cads And cadgers, leeches, lice and vampire-bats That bleed the theatre; everybody's body; Charity, politics, churchâtheir humble servant; And nightly the performance in the cage Before the assorted multitude Of people, people, people: this, and worse; Then death and swift oblivion: nothing done; Nothing at all to be remembered by: No other noise so big as stage renown Is silenced utterly by death. St. J. No fame Outlasts the world: there lives the hope of man: Death's meaning is that consciousness shall cease, The earth be purged of life; thus in the end All men are equal, matter pure from taint Of anguish; in the nebula become Essential fire, free from solicitude. This is the freedom of the Universe. Sir T. Matter grown anxious: that is very man. St. J. Therefore the player's is an envied lot: No other artist so intensely lives In the world's consciousness. Sir T. But after death? St. J. Dread nothing that can happen after death: The world will cease: live in that thought, that mood, Upon the eternal moment. Sir T. But to mark The world before one dies! St. J. The inmost hope Of all men! I believe that you and I Could orientate the world's imagination; And that would make a mark. Sir T. Tell me of that! The whole thing stirs me: tell me more of that! First have I grasped your meaning? All the past, Religion, drama, art is dead to us, Because we know that all is Matter, all Imagination, beauty, passion, power Through time and times and changing suns and orbs From spacious nebula to nebula. This is the freedom of the Universe Wherein imagination must delight, Now that Olympus, Asgard, Heaven and Hell, Gods, God and separate soul are dead and done. St. J. My meaning; yes. Material Heaven and Hell, Olympus, Hades, Asgard, Nifelheim Are Matter's memories of pellucid fire It once was and will be, an evidence Of our material nature wrapped in myth Unconsciously. Imagination lives In Matter, being itself material power, Irradiant, telepathic, magical, Imponderable as lightning or the light, Ethereal essence of the Universe. To free this power from twenty centuries Of God and Sin; endow it with its own, The infinite Universe; to launch the world In space again upon a virgin track As though the foul old rut and blood-drenched way Had never been! Oh, Tristram! Help meâyou! It can be done! Sir T. How can I help you, Gervase? St. J. I want your stage. A while ago you said A people has a drama only once: From âGorboducâ to âThe Tempestâ fifty years; And nothing since. The deadly truth of that Perturbed me; and I feared my eastern workâ A play I made wherein dynamic art Of Matter rives asunder all the scale Of being; restrings the lyre, and sets the tune Anew: I feared this work was wasted; now, Having thought it outâeven while we talked, my mind Was labouring with itâthat foolish fear is dead. Twice in the past transcendent drama flowered, A people's crowning glory. First in Greece: A mighty triad and a rhythmic scroll, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides. Sir T. Euripides? A decadent, I thought. St. J. Matter knows nothing of decadence, a word Corrupt with spirit: only chance and change, Power and imagination. Let me speak.â The war with Persia, Marathon, Salamis, Battles and victories by land and sea, Revived in Attic bosoms, Attic brains, Profound regard for things of Attica, With ardent interest in the Universe Whereof it felt itself the heart and soul. In England next after two thousand years, The most instinctive people in the world, The mightiest and the freest, having undone With axe and fire the strangling Roman creed, That like a caul about their fancy clung, Forthwith despatched to hell the rivalry Of Spain, redeemed the seas, began to stretch Their giant limbs in isles and continents, And take the measure of the quartered globe. Thus the imagination of these lands Became one living cord, whereon were strung All story, legend, lore; and like a birth Miraculous, divine dramatic art, Which to be truly great demands a great Impassioned people for an audience, rose From out the loftiest minds and shaped itself The mirror of a master people's pride. And now a greater England about to break The husk of Christendom, as in its youth It sloughed off Rome, begins the world anew, Imperial England of itself aware, And man, the conscience of the Universe. I mean to spend my fortune and my life In the high service of imagination For England's sake and man's. The dreams, the lore, The rags and rust of thirty centuries: To cast these wholly, and accoutre man In all the beauty, splendour, scope and power Of this material, eternal fate, The Universe, whereof he is the nerveâ The inmost fibre, flowering in brain and blood! For this I would give up my life in pain. Sir T. This will I help you in with all my power: It dazzles me; it seizes on my soul. St. J. A greater drama than the world has known Is shrouded here in darkness. Sir T. We must knead The public mind into the shape of this To make it possible. The play's the thing! St. J. Yes; not the pulpit, not the press: the play, Loftier and broader than religious rites, The mirror of an empire's pride, of man's Imagination, from the past released, Dowered with the freedom of the Universe. Sir T. What will this drama be? St. J. I cannot tell. My own play is the first step in a path Untrodden. At the journey's end I see A new world purged of God and purged of Sin, Where men are healthy, women beautiful, All men, all women, beautiful and strong. Re-enter Lady Sumner. Sir T. Martha! How like a ghost you steal upon us! Where have you been? Lady S. The streets, the squares, the river; No home to go to! Wandering in the night I saw your windows lit, and knew: I knew You plotted here. What will you do? You're not About to send me anywhere! I'll die; I mean to die. I wanted Tristram too; But I can die alone: timeâgive me time! It's hard, it's very hard: you wish me gone, And cannot understand how hard it is: I have no children, and my husband hates me. St. J. You have your children. Lady S. Mock me not with that: You know as well as I that death ends all. St. J. Nothing can end. The mystery Matter, lasts For ever. Lady S. Am I mad, indeed, or you? What are you talking of? My soulâmy soul It is, that's up in arms against the world. St. J. If death ends all, what is the soul? Lady S. My soul Is me, one aching nerve from head to foot. St. J. How is it clad, your soul? What atmosphere Environs it, wherein does it consist? Lady S. Naked my soul is; and it cannot breathe For lack of air; and it consists in sin. St. J. In sin? Lady S. Dead sin, it cannot now commit. Sir T. Now Gervase; put your message to the test. St. J. There is no sin. Be silent, Martha! Fear, Despondency, decay, the will to die Should neither speak nor think, but fling themselves Upon the Universe. Be silent! Let My meaning touch your nerves. Attempt not Apprehension: feel what I say.âThis sense Of sin is ignorance only; every voice Must thunder that, and every intellect Record it, every heart delight to hoard The knowledge till the tissue of the world, Engrained with truth, be guiltless in conceit As in effect it is. Here we are left Unfriended on the surface, far from home; And that imagination which we are, Betrayed and lost on this outlandish earth, Believes itself to blame; but neither man Nor Matter's answerable: the Universe Is a becoming, a passion and a pain, A rapt imagination. Purge yourself Of God, of Heaven and Hell, of soul and sin, Of small humanities, fantastic moods, Putridities of spirit, posies, myths; For all these dreams will leave you when you die. Be Matter pure as flame. Lady S. My soul, my soul! It springs from God: there once was God. St. J. No God: God hitherto has been the world's excuse, The shadow of man that tripped him everywhere, A phantom cul-de-sac in the Universe, A dog in the manger. Men need no excuse: If they must be, they must be what they are. Lady S. And what are they? St. J. I told you: Matter, once Inherent in the nebula that cooled, Contracted, and became the sun and us. Out of the bowels of the earth we rise: Though in that thought at home and happy enough, Yet there imagination feels itself The merest parvenu when it recalls Incalculable ages throbbed away Within the glistering fire diaphanous That filled the deep conceiving womb of space; And on the earth, upon the surface here, No longer than a week-end visit seems Its spectral period hitherto, beside That sojourn in the cooling globe, and date Without beginning in the pristine fire. Lady S. I feel a meaning, Gervase, I feel a power More beautiful than God. How stale God seems Upon a sudden and how ugly! St. J. Of a truth God is an ugly dream, whate'er it meant At one time. Lady S. Who made us then? St. J. We were not made. I told you, Martha; it is man that makesâ And birds and beavers, spiders, bees and ants; All conscious Matter makes and mars a little: But of the staple of the Universe, Unconscious Matter, what we know is this: That it becomes in systems, suns and earths, In plants and beasts and men, a Universe. Lady S. That seems more wonderful than to be made: I feel it may be true. But, oh, dear Gervase, What is the use, what is the end of it? St. J. No end, and no beginning anywhere: Only eternity, eternal Matter And Matter's form, imaginationâNo; Not form: how metaphysic tarnishes A simple word! Only imagination, The most exalted name of Matter, wrought From flame to ice, from ice again to flame Through suns and planets, verdure, battle, blood, Degrees of being, and miracles of change. Lady S. Why should it be? What purpose can it serve? St. J. It must be, since it is; and must be so, Or certainly it would be otherwise. It serves no purpose, it is beautiful: That is the whole. Your children, dead, had no Beginning and will have no end. They once Were fire; that fire, transmuted into love, Distilled them from your womb, and was Itself your children: cooled again, it rests In earth, and will be limpid fire once more, When all the orbs that hang about the sun Return into its bosom, or other radiant Passion of Matter impregnate space anew. Lady S. I need not die then, since I cannot end? St. J. Oh now my brain rejoices! Terror lurked Beneath that white austerity of mine, Lest when I tried my message in the fireâ The first time: true; but with a woman, and one Whom dread of death and fancied need of death Kindles to any news and change of mood: I say, I feared lest your intense despair, That gilds my truth at once, should burn it up. But now you think there never can be need For terror, doubt, or agony of mind In presence of a sinless Universe, Where all is mystery, all imagination, All beauty, passion, power unending, all The purest Matter. Lady S. I can live; but where? Where can I find a home for this new thought? Not in the theatre, not in the church, Not in the houses or the books of men! St. J. I have a mansion in a forest-aisle Where a deep silence, intimately felt, And poignant as a perfume, like a mode Of subtle splendour evermore becomes. A green and branching honeycomb of glades, A sylvan city clusters round my house; And near it in an arbour sancro-sanct, A chapelle ardent of the forest, lies In state a famous memory. There it was The queen of the Iceni stood at bay, A desperate hind against the Roman pack, In that last battle of her overthrow. The trench she dug, the mound she reared are held By oak and beech; but in this inmost bower Beside her camp forlorn, this secret haunt Of emerald shadow, emerald light, a crypt Of living silence, sculptured boscage, turf That gathers incense from the generous earth, There on this virgin ground, a green and bronze Carpet of fragrancies and couch of state, These doomed things are enshrined. Lady S. I might begin To live again in such a woodland haven, If I were free. St. J. What freedom can you want More than the freedom of the universe? Lady S. The freedom of the Universe! St. J. Whereof My message is the charter. Lady S. But my husband? Sir T. You have no husband now. Let Gervase speak His precept of divorce. Lady S. No husband now? Sir T. A prophetess of failure who fulfils Her prophecy against her husband, severs The marriage-bond. Lady S. I knew not what I did! Oh, Tristram! St. J. Martha! . . . Tristram, take her hand! [Sir Tristram and Lady Sumner join hands. The speech of men is so corrupt with dreams, Forgotten alchemy and astral lies, So rank with spirit and the cult of God That nothing can be said as it is known. In the pure matter of sex, befouled with words Of sanction supererogant, I use The most material language to pronounce Divorce between you. Since the pride of life Is dead in you, the woman, and your seed Restored to that profound unconsciousness Which is the general mode of the Universe, Nothing constrains you to consider him With whom you spent yourself courageously: Mind and imagination now are one With Matter; and this privilege is yours, To know alive the deep delight of death. For you, the man, in whom the pride of life Intensely burns, this woman is no mate. Your art will claim you body, brain, and sex Without a rival henceforth.âMan and wife You are no longer. Let your hands disjoined Witness divorce between you. [Sir Tristram releases Lady Sumner's hand. Lady S. Was there once A thing called love? Oh, love! Deathâdeath and hell. St. J. You drink the dead sea. Lady S. Dead. St. J. Yet you will live. My car is waiting: through the silent town, The silent city and the lamplit night, Watched by the star-attended moon, half seen Behind her cloudy lattice in the skies, Our wind-shod wheels shall bear us speedily. Lady S. What call have I to go? St. J. The call of night, By sleepless fancies heard and souls set free. The forest calls you in your blood and brain: Like spell-bound tides the billowy woodlands sleep; Through labyrinthine thickets pencilled beams Explode in silvery silence; far withdrawn Behind the darknesses of clustered boles The emerald forest moonshine glances clear, Imprisoned wells of light. Come, Martha, come. Lady S. The woods will cover me and hide me close. St. J. Come, sister, come. Lady S. I come. St. J. Good night. Sir T. Good night. To-morrow, Gervase, bring your tragedy. St. J. My play? No tragedy; a triumph, Tristram. Sir T. A triumph may it be! Again, good night. St. J. Good night. Lady S. Farewell. Sir T. Farewell. Be free; be happy. [St. James's and Lady Sumner go out. I must have money. [Opens the door of the Business-room, turns up the light, and discovers Europa asleep.] Pride of life, pure sex, Dreaming and roseate! Trick of the night, and sleep Pretended? Smiles! . . . . . Europa! No; she breathes With parted lips, her nostrils, carved and sweet As immortelles of pearl, too delicate To fill in slumber's heedless anarchy Her rhythmic bosom's vaulted depths; her arms Hang listless, and her limbs beneath her gown Are like the gates of heaven, ajar. Superb She-creature this! She looked desire to-day; To-night her will effects the shortest way. I must have money. [Having removed Europa's clothes from the desk he is about to open it, when Europa wakens and looks about.] Beautiful of you To be here on the instant that my life Begins again! You overheard? Europa. Not all; I slept. Your bishop with the sorcerer's voice Of silver thrilled me first, then charmed my heart With deep material news that brought to life Dead dreams of mine. I want to be myself For this one night; not the smart actress, vulgar Business-woman that fights or smooths her way With scorn or kisses as the battle bends, But Matter, pure and passionateâas I am. Sir T. St. James's message falls on fertile ground! Europa. He says a thing there that will move the world. Sir T. Where shall I take you to? Europa. Come home with me. Sir T. You think that will be best? Why do you wear Your costume still? Europa. I am a woman such As Cressid was, an amateur of men; Never inconstant while her passion lasts, But not to be compelled by love or law. The name I hate most in the world is wife; And the professional drudgery of the blood Which marriage is, seems to me hell on earth. Sir T. Not always hell. What do you know of marriage? Europa. I had a husband in the States. Sir T. Divorced? Europa. Better than that: killed in the Cuban war. Sir T. Why do you wear your costume still? Europa. Because The drapery becomes me; and I meant To change its folds for other clinging folds Before I dressed. Sir T. Here in the theatre? Europa. How could I tell you would be free to spend The night with me? Sir T. Am I the kind of man You take me for? Europa. What do I take you for? Sir T. A fool, I think. Europa. Oh, have I overdone it? I thought you loved the pure Material truth. I will be difficult at once! Sir T. Too late, Europa. Europa. Why? What can you not forgive? I came; you found me sleeping, and were glad. Sir T. The sweetest action may be spoiled by speech: A thing no woman ever understands. Europa. What have I said? Correct me, punish me! I spoke too soon; my mind is scarce awake. Sir T. How brutal women are, how cynical! I've never known a tender-hearted woman. Europa. Hard as a diamond am I; and my love A jewelled flame: high hearts are always hard. Souls lapped in cotton wool are not for me! Sir T. Now comes the diatribe! No woman yet Could keep her temper past a word or two! Europa. You struck the flint and you shall feel the fire. I find you as I find the rest of men, Obtuse, distrustful, flabby, impotent; Fit to beget a fool or two at home, And dribble out uncomfortable lives In parliaments and stalls and smoking-rooms. It's iron women loveâDamascus blades, Not bludgeons of the theatre stuffed with rags. Sir T. How often have you said that? Reel-and-rote, A parrot speech! So all viragoes scold Since Eve dared Adam. Come; a different tune. Europa. What? Are you strong, Sir Tristram? Are you strong? Power in a man I worship: show me power. Sir T. Go to your room and leave your costume there. Europa. Give me my clothes, then. Sir T. No; come back for them. Europa. But I shall be half naked. Sir T. What of that? Europa. Will you attend me to my room? Sir T. Not I. Europa. The passages are dark. Sir T. You know the way. Europa. I know the way! This is a kind of strength; But, sir, I'm not defeated. Sir T. No? Europa. Not yet. When I return we shall resume the fight: Since you're so masterful, I must be won. [Goes out. Sir T. The cureless wound of sex that nature dealt Gives man the victory still. If women knew The tenth part of their power while passion lasts! [Opens the desk and takes from a secret drawer a handful of bank-notes. A MONTH ELAPSES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Scene: Sir Tristram Sumner's Reception-room in the Grosvenor Theatre, as in Act III. Hildreth is sitting at a table with letters. Enter Abbot. Abbot. Not yet? Hildreth. No, Abbot. Enter Salerne. Salerne. Has he come? Hildreth. Not yet. Salerne. What says your mercury, Abbot? Abbot. Zero, zero! Salerne. I think myself the play will fail. Hildreth. I don't. The naÃ¯vety, novelty, audacity; The this, the that that people prattle of; The Bishop's name, the scandal, and the cry, The noise of the event will bring it off. Abbot. I doubt it; and I think Sir Tristram scents Disaster in the air. Salerne. Never before Do I remember such a slipshod time As this vile month has been. Sir Tristram's hand Is out: his eye untrue; such staging, such A tangled skein, dropped stitches everywhere; Warped wood and crumbling walls! The play's quite good; But for the cast, the acting and the sceneâ Give me a fit-up company astray And starving in the potteries, and I'll whip The top to such a purpose in a week That this fine Grosvenor corps would drown itself En masse to see such art in castaways. Hildreth. Salerne, you've been with Groom! I know the sound; That man's a malady; a passing thought Of him will sometimes start the dullest brain On venturous speeches. Salerne. Start the dullest brain? Hildreth. Like mine, I mean. Salerne. Ah.âYes; I've been with Groom. He's drinking Burgundy in the âRose and Crown.â Poor Groom! The one great actor of our time. Finest since Garrick I should say. Abbot. And I. Hildreth. Come, come; no treason! Groom is very well; But we're Sir Tristram's men. Salerne. And loyal still! Abbot. Oh, loyal enough! Sir Tristram needs it too. I'd burn his bishop in Smithfield if I could. [Goes out. Salerne. Why is he late? Hildreth. You know as much as I. Salerne. Infer as much? Hildreth. I'll not discuss the matter. Salerne. You're too devoted, Hildreth. Some one comes. Hildreth. That's not his step. Salerne. [Looking out] The Bishop! Curse his cloth! [Goes out. Enter St. James's. St. J. Good evening, Hildreth. Is Sir Tristram here? Hildreth. Not yet, my lord. St. J. At what time is he due? Hildreth. He's overdue, my lord. St. J. Unlike him that. Hildreth. Unlike him? Yes; a month ago. St. J. A month? Hildreth. May I speak freely? St. J. Speak without reserve If it concerns the welfare of my friend. Hildreth. My lord, most intimately. For a month His leading lady has led him by the nose. St. J. Europa Troop: familiar at rehearsal; But that I thought the method of the stage. Hildreth. Oh no, my lord. Sir Tristram kept a state About him always till the change began. St. J. What change? Hildreth. The change from promptitude and ease To absence, fear, perplexity in all He does. St. J. Unjust! Consideration, care, An artist's terror; but mastery of his work. Hildreth. Pardon, my lord. I love him, and I know. The definite purpose, the consummate skill That made his management a royal game Have left him; and he stumbles to the goal, Which once he reached unerring and direct As wireless news or planetary light. St. J. Fine of you, Hildreth! But I think the play Replies for all Sir Tristram's hesitance. Hildreth. Partly, my lord: the play is difficult. St. J. Where is he now? Hildreth. None of us know, my lord. I dread mischance. St. J. On what conjecture, Hildreth? Hildreth. The vaguest: at his house, no word of him; And at his club, no word. St. J. That means no more Than this: he was not home nor at his club. Hildreth. Yes, but, my lord, the first night of a play! Not in the history of the theatreâ Enter Sir Tristram St. J. No more foreboding, Hildreth! Sir T. Gervase! High On Heaven's dark brow we'll hang your name to-night. [Looking over the letters. Bills: invitations. Why should people charge Each other for the things they need; and why Should one man want to meet another man? We know what men are. In a million, one May have the right to meet his fellowsâNo; Not one in twenty millions! Men deserve Each other's scorn.âThere's nothing, Hildreth, nothing. Hildreth. Sir Tristram, I implore you! Sir T. Leave us, Hildreth. You shall command me when the curtain falls. You please me always, Hildreth. [Hildreth goes out. St. J. So distraught! You're like a woman, Tristram. Sir T. A woman? True: Old men are like old women. Don't we know How age makes neuters of us? All alike Unhappy; cold and bloodless, curst and shrill! St. J. I understand! The black rings round your eyesâ Court mourning for a day of passion, spent In some shameless bosom! Once you could drain The fount of energy as genial men Will do, may do; but when the world appears Thereafter like a desolate seaboard stripped At ebb of tide, men must begin to spare Their native power: the nerves are perilous things To sport with: palsy a price exorbitant For passing pleasure: to adventure youth Throughout one's lifeâwhy, Tristram, that's To burn the candle in the middle too! Sir T. I burnt A torch to-day to Aphrodite: yes; And burnt it out: the more fool I; for love Should leave a gathering coal. I know, I know! But fear not you; my unclogged intellect Will fling the prophet's part I play to-night Across the footlights like a shower of stars, Of falling stars. St. J. Distort not hazardous tropes To evil omens! Sir T. Expect no triumph, Gervase. A stormy night; shipwreck, perhaps. St. J. At least My prologue will compel a tolerant mood. Sir T. A paying audience tolerant! Money's worth; They come to be arrested, entertained. Your speech will goad a curiosity Already piqued. The play's a great event, No doubt; but your success may be the world's Defeat. St. J. The world's defeat? Sir T. By which I mean You come a hundred years before your time. St. J. You must not think, nor feel that! Heart and brain The world is with us, waiting for our word. Sir T. The world is waiting always for the word It must obey, the news it must believe; But never recognizes what it needs, And worships only craft and jugglery. It loves to see a well-known trick performed Another way, to hear an old lie told Divertingly in some fresh parable. St. J. That's not the great mood, Tristram. Sir T. No; it's war: Behind, the great idea; here, in front, The petty detail and order of the night. Remember your prediction: You believe Terrific war will burst the chrysalis, The Christendom that hangs in filthy rags About the eager soul already winged With crimson plumes and violet, green and gold, Psyche at last, pure Matter of itself, Imagination, free of the Universe. With words and shows equipped we wage great war, And here to-night deliver battle. Temple! Enter Temple from the Dressing-room. Wine, Heroic brandy, or the water of life? . . . Champagne for me. . . . Nothing? To toast the play! St. J. That's not my mood at all! Sir T. Nor is it mine! The shimmering surface of the player's life Is all he flaunts when most his soul is stirred. He turns the silver lining to the world; The tempest and the darkness where he breeds His high ostents and subtleties of art Are hidden. Who can tell what tragic mirth May occupy the other side of the moon? St. J. Fill up for me too, Temple! I forget In this erect and seminal thought of mine That men are many-sided. I toast the war Our play proclaims to-night. [Temple, having filled two tumblers with champagne, returns to the Dressing-room. Sir Tristram and St. James's drink. Sir T. The war of wars! St. J. A century, a millennium of war Against the sin and sacro-sanctity That holds the world in thrall and hides from man His true material being. [Rouse appears at the door of the Reception-room. Rouse. The overture, My lord. [Disappears. St. J. I come, I come.âStrange fear perturbs Me suddenly. Sir T. But that's a certain sign Of perfect power. The house will welcome you: We love frank courage still. St. J. Courage? What courage? Having some gift of oratory, I Deliver my own prologue. Courage once Took heart in men when those who thought and spake Were racked and roasted: this attempt Exacts effrontery: not courage. Sir T. Say Effrontery: you do it; it is yours; A piece of you: accept it; love it therefore. St. J. A shamefulness attends this thing. The house Will hiss me, Tristram. Sir T. No; your fervid voice Will mould and temper to delight the crude Anticipation of the audience. Speak Like one inspired; speak, Gervase, like yourself. [St. James's goes out. Now, Temple, quickly! [As Sir Tristram crosses to his Dressing-room Europa Troop enters, dressed for her part. Europa. Tristram! Tristram! See How beautiful I am! Not dressed yet! Fie! Kiss me; my bosom. Are you tired of me? I pout then! Dear, to-day: so good you were That I can think of nothing in the world But to be yours; and you must come to-night! My love is inexhaustible: as like Irradiant metal that scatters momently Its multitudinous lustre, as summer-time Is like the month of June: the more it spends The more it has to spend: [Opens the door of the Business-room and turns up the light.] And, dear, I need Some money; men with bills molested me As I came up the stairs; the attendants here Relax their duties sadly: I believe They're not above a bribe. [Sir Tristram closes the door of his Dressing-room, and takes from the secret drawer in the Business-room some bank-notes, which he hands to Europa. Europa. How much? Sir T. The whole! You've had it all. This was a treacherous hoard, And rightly spent on you. In any way Of honest business, or dishonest art, It had been worse than lost, like fairy gold That turns to shreds of flint when daylight kills Its phantom glory. It was wisely spent. We have obliged each other. [Sir Tristram enters his Dressing-room, and speaks from it unseen. Europa. How hard you are! Harder than me. But you will come to-night? Sir T. Perhaps. You know this splendid play will fail. Europa. Our parts will save it, Tristram; you and I. What chiming prattle do we love to hearâ âThe play is nothing; but the acting? Ah, âSir Tristram! Oh, Europa!â Stupid plays Are what we want, with skeletons to drape In flesh and blood of us. You'll come to-night? Sir T. If the play fails? Europa. Can't I console you, Tristram? Sir T. If it succeeds? Europa. You triumph in my arms. Sir T. Not tired of me? Europa. Not nearly! Hateful word! Are you tired, Tristram? Sir T. A little, of myself. Europa. Come home with me to-night, and you shall fall In love with Tristram Sumner. I have charms Beyond belief to make men love themselves. You come? Sir T. I come. Europa. The coda, Tristram! Quick! Clang, clash, sapristi, pomb! The overture Is over. I must hear St. James's speak His prologue. Sir T. Do. And send me word at once How they receive him. Europa. I shall send my love A message of episcopal debuts, Episcopal debuts, episcopalâ [Goes out. Enter Lady Sumner. Sir T. [Still from his Dressing-room] That some one? Lady S. Yes. Sir T. Who is it? Lady S. One you wished Never to see again. Sir T. My wife! Lady S. That was. I came in haste. I had a deep resolve; But all my purpose crumbled as I passed Europa Troop in the corridor. Sir T. [At the door of his Dressing-room] Who else! What other actress could you hope to meet? She takes the heroine in our play to-night. Lady S. Your mistress, Tristram: I could tell at once. Sir T. After the play: I cannot see you now. [Withdraws into the Dressing-room. Lady S. âDo you know that Warwick Groom and Martha Sackville were lovers? She visited him every night in his dressing-room at the Parthenon when he played Romeoââ Sir T. [Entering the Reception-room and closing the door of the Dressing-room.] Give me that letter! Lady S. It's bitten in my brain.â ââAnd the reason why he insisted on beginning the fourth act with the fifth scene of the third act was the reason you guess at once: it gave them time. But that was not the only place in the play where they performed their private intermede. How this was managed? Ask old Odham, Groom's dresser.â Sir T. You stole that letter. Lady S. I stole it. Sir T. Give it me. Lady S. I burnt it in the forest: the flame of it Was like a passion-flower. Sir T. That crude account Of nauseous lust! Lady S. Nothing is nauseous men And women do in any mood at all. But to be old and doneâthat's nauseous; worse Than death. Why can't we die by taking thought? Sir T. Who wrote it? Lady S. Odham himself. I knew his hand. Sir T. How was this managed? Um? You won't? You must! Odham, being ill and bribed, you took his place, A substitute, in male attire? Lady S. I did! How have you guessed it, Tristram? Sir T. Could there be A way besides as simpleâand secure! The infantile device of Cupid, blind Betrayer of himself! Old Odham spied: He saw you in Warwick's arms between the acts. A pleasant memory! Lady S. I have faced it all. Sir T. Why are you come? Lady S. I came like destiny, Prepared and armed with power and purpose, gained In the forest. But I met your mistress: fate Of worlds and women is shifted by such straws. Re-enter Hildreth. Sir T. Back to the forest, then.âWhat is it, Hildreth? Hildreth. St. James's triumphs. Sir T. And without offence? No protest? Hildreth. None. A section seemed at first In tune for ribaldry; but soon his clear Goodwill, the nerve and music of his voice, His gracious looks and speech secured the house. The gallery points his periods with applause; The stalls sit purring like a catshow charmed With extra cream or chin adroitly scratched; And women from the boxes lean and listen Like cows across a gate at milking-time. Sir T. The house is fused then? Hildreth. Mob at once, well pleased With anything. Sir T. And well begun's half done! The prologue's over? Hildreth. No. I meant to note The finish; but Europa Troop despatched Immediate news. She saidâ Re-enter Europa Troop. Europa. Too soon, too soon! Oh, Tristram!âPardon, madamâApplause has whirled St. James's to the skies. He stands entranced, With face uplifted like a seraph, pealing Material music, from his prologue worlds Away. Into the nebula! The house Sits up and holds its breath. Re-enter Abbot. Abbot. Sir Tristram, come! In Heaven's name come! St. James's spreads himself Worse than we ever heard him; miles beyond The limits of the play! He must be stopped! Re-enter Salerne. Salerne. You've told him? Abbot. Yes. The Bishop's broken loose, Discoursing Matter like a thunderstorm; A thick brocade and silvery web of rain, With crash of bells and bolts, while through the loom A random shuttle of golden lightning playsâ As Warwick might have said. Salerne. Amenity To what is happening! âAll is Matter, all,â The Bishop cried, when from the gallery dropped A question like a bomb, âHi! What price God?â Sir T. Olympus felt itself neglected. Well? Salerne. Then all the blasphemy we've heard him speak Came trolling forth, âThe shutters of the mind; âA fire-proof curtain: ghastly cul-de-sac; âA last excuse; sublime taboo; a tip; âA patent medicine: an accepted lie.â âAtheist!â they cry, âblasphemer!â scourging him To reckless opposition. There he stands At every lull in the tempest knelling out His dogma like a tocsin. What to do Surpasses me! Enter Mark Belfry. Belfry. God! Crowds believe in God! My cats, Sir Tristram, what a fool you are! A fighting parson crossed the floats and all The stalls came after bellowingâmen I mean. The pittites followed and the gallery boys Are breaking forms and shying splinters. âGod! âFor God!â they roar, parson and moneylender, Broker and banker, counterjumper, peer. The women, too; they all believe in God; Duchesses, milliners, wives and prostitutes, They scream for God. God pays! you bet! God pays! They'll wreck your theatre, Tristram; but I'll buy it! The Grosvenor? Yes; in ruins! I want it. Name Your figure, Tristram. Sir T. Where's St. James's? Belfry. Dead, I guess, by this time; trampled into pulp. [Lady Sumner sinks fainting on the couch unnoticed by the others. Sir T. My Gervase! God forbid! Abbot, Salerne, Darken the theatre. Let the orchestra Strike up a blaring march. We'll clear the stage, And play St. James's play. Come after me! Belfry. Cash, Tristram, cash! You know you're ruined. Name Your price. I want the Grosvenor Theatreâand I'llâ [Sir Tristram goes out, followed by everybody except Lady Sumner. Enter Warwick Groom. Groom. Martha! To meet you here! . . . Sleeping? A swoon! [He raises her to a sitting posture, and she begins to revive. As she breathes with difficulty he unfastens her cloak, and finds her dressed like a boy. Lady S. Oh, Warwick, are we dead? My throat is parched Enough for hell. [He breaks the neck of a bottle of champagne, fills a tumbler, and gives her to drink] Alive still in the world Of lust and lush! Oh, Warwick, strike me, hurt me! My withered fancy flounders in the mire; My memory chooses words I never loved, Ideas foreign to my prime. Pure pain, Absorbing every sense, would clean my soul.â Is this the Parthenon or the Grosvenor, Warwick? Groom. The Grosvenor, Martha. Lady S. Something is happening here. Groom. Something abnormal for the stage! I passed Unnoticed in the tumult! Lady S. Listen, Warwick, As if you were the Universe itself. No one would give an ear, or understand; But you will, Warwick; I belong to you; You had the bloom and scent, the flower of me. I think of that unhallowed, holy week A hundred times a day, a hundred times. You were my lover, Warwick, and my friend; My child, my doll: I used to dress you, dear. I live in that: that wonder-working time, When all my senses and my soul, aroused From the sweet slumber of virginity, Became one instinct and ardour of womanhood. Lay your proud head upon my bosom, loveâ My faded bosom.âNow, my dear, now, now! If we could fall asleep and never waken.â Why did I marry Tristram! Why? Not once Have you demanded that. Groom. Because I guessed. He showed me to youâ Lady S. Hush! He did: and moreâ He told me you were any woman's man. Groom. That was true, too. Lady S. But you adored me, Warwick? You had a passion for me, a passion, Warwick? Groom. I loved you then as truly as I love You now; haggard and worn, or fresh and sweet, You were and are the woman of my choice; You only, Martha. Lady S. And you, my man of men. Give me some wine again. Will you not drink? [They drink; and Lady Sumner sings. When I had found a gem I lost Where none would ever think, My heart became a cup of wine I gave my love to drink. My voice is cracked; but, Warwick, do you know, There's not a happier woman in the world. You wonder at my dress? Sit here by me: I'll tell you pleasantly the whole romance. And smoke! Do you remember how we quarrelled About tobacco? You loved it best, you saidâ To plague me, Warwick: better than women or wine. But when I wept you tossed a box away Of Delicadedzas worth their weight in gold. [While Groom turns to the cabinet to choose a cigar, Lady Sumner pours the contents of the vial into her wine. Groom then sits beside her. This is the story, Warwick. My husband knew: Blackmail, or wanton mischief, Odham meant, And wrote him; but he died, old Odham did, If you remember, on my wedding-day. My husband never told me. A month ago I found old Odham's letter, and knew by it The fire and fuel of my husband's hate. My husband loved me long; and I loved him, Although I married him in a pique at you: People are made that way: a man and woman That pig together come to love each other. Blister my tongue! It is not I that speakâ Only the ruins of me, the broken bits.â My husband's love being dead and mine being deadâ That kind of love dies out, and when it dies It's dead indeed, in women: dead love being turned To festering jealousy and hate in him By reason of the letter he ignored When I was young and queen of heartsâI used To think it beautiful of me to keep Myself for Tristram: I had, you know, A thousand lovers, Warwick: is it true I was as tempting as they said and sang? Groom. All men adored you, Martha: doubt it not. Your shape, your walk, your talk, your mouth, your eyes, Body and soul, all men desired you, dear. Lady S. I shall die happy, Warwick.âMy husband's hate, My horror of myself were killing me, When Gervase came, my cousin Gervase; he Whose play it is to-night. Did some one say They're trampling him to death? But that can't be! Groom. Oh, that's impossible! Lady S. I dreamt it, Warwick.â My cousin Gervase, bishop and genius, best Of angels always, with a wonderful Injunction from the Universe, a most Authentic mandate, severed us; and me He carried to the forest, there to clothe My naked fancy with the Universe, A sinless, Godless Universe of his. It seems to me a matter of little moment Whether there is a God or not; but Sin Is greatâthe greatest: all is death save Sin: That is my message, Warwick! Every one Must have a message now: the only way To individualize. Warwick, have you A message? Groom. I have a message, Martha: one I shall deliver shortly. Lady S. Tell it now. Groom. Not now; and not to you. Lady S. In everything, My dearest love, you shall be absolute Warwick, And tell me not, or tell me as you choose. Groom. I see how much you need to talk. My heart Is listening: speak your heart out, child. Lady S. I roamed the forest day and night and fixed My fancy in the nebula at first. Profound relief it was to breathe no more The breath of man and woman, love and hate, Desire, despair, Heaven, Hell, and God, and Sin: To be pure soullessness awaiting chance, My cousin told me of, when all the orbs That hang about the Sun, and me and mine Shall fall into its bosom, or other radiant Passion of Matter impregnate space anew. But life was not so easily rebuked: I had that letter; and through the nebula, As potent rays will pierce substantial things, It seared itself upon my heart and brain. My sin tormented me; and everywhere Nothing but Sin I saw: concupiscence Of insect, bird, and beast: bloodstained besides; Not only foxes, weasels, falcons, rats, But blackbirds, thrushes, robins drenched with blood Of helpless prey and raving drunken songs. In candelabra where the scented oil Of honeysuckle burned, I found a crowd Of shameless couples, male and female, pairedâ A brothel of midges, Warwick; in tender bells Of chaste convolvuluses spider-wolves Attacked unhappy bees; and once I saw A cheerful skylark chewing a grasshopper That wriggled like a man being sawn asunder. I thought of business, policy, pleasure, war, Where folk devour each other; and in a flash I understood that it must still be so: No man or woman can ever lift a foot Except to tread and splash in someone's heart. And out of that my dazzling message sprang, That Life is the Sin of the Universe. You see? We do not sin; we are Sin, Warwick. Yes! It makes the whole world beautiful, I think. The Sin is great and splendid, deep and high, Exquisite Sin: physicians feel like this, Studying a perfect fever, or some disease It palsies one to think of. Life is Sin, The wonderful wild Sin of the Universe.â [Rises, and walks to the door and back. Where was I, Warwick? Groom. [Rises] In the forest, Martha. Why did you leave it? Lady S. For a purpose, high And tender. I took upon myself the Sin Of the Universe as far as the Universe has sinned In me; repented of it, and straightway came To Tristram, intending to confess and be Forgiven. First I went home, and dressed myself Once more in these, the wrappage of my sin, My special sin, my passionate, wilful sin:â We are the sin of the Universe; but Sin Itself can sin? Perhaps; I cannot tell. Groom. You kept these? Lady S. In a wardrobe, fresh as spring With yearly lavender. A fitting garb Of penitence it seemed; a punishment, A pang, indeed, to show myself to him, My husband, in the vesture of my love! Groom. And did you not? Lady S. No, Warwick, for I met His mistress at the door, and gentleness Became malignity. Groom. But afterwards? What end did you propose? Lady S. My death, my death! Oh, love, I wish to die: I mean to dieâ Alone, without regret. That week of Sin I came here to repent envelopes all The past and all the future in a cloud Of glory. At the sight of you my mind, And that imagination which I amâ Let me remember that: the Universe Is pure imagination conscious in us: Most beautiful! The Universe becomes That week of passionate Sin and hides my soul As in the pristine fire. Take off my cloak. [She advances to the centre of the room. Groom follows and removes her cloak. Am I not beautiful again? Groom. As fresh As hawthorn buds, desirable as wine In summer droughts and molten calentures, As sweet as bread and meat to starving men! What miracle is this? Lady S. The miracle Of Life triumphant. Drink to Life and Love. [They drink. It stings a little! . . . Help me, Warwick! Oh! [He supports her to the couch, and she sits. Groom. You've taken poison? Have I drunk it, too? Lady S. No, Warwick; I took it all. I want to die. Help me; embrace me; hold me! Oh, what pain! Let me lie down. [He lays her on the couch. Inflexible as love, Death rends and hurts at first; but soon its way Is like a summer voyage in the south. What bells are these? That music in the air? I know!âthe stealthy hansoms jingling past With doors half open, nightly traps to catch Adventurous lovers. CafÃ©s disengage Self-centred diners fed and flushed to dream Of deeds of love in glimmering theatres, The woman and the man, till it be time To take each other sweetly. Kiss me, Warwick. You have your arms about me? Groom. Yes. Lady S. I die Wrapped round about with youth and love and life. The earth is like a chariot of fire Wheeling into the Sun. Good night. [Dies. Groom. Good night. Nothing is wonderful since all is wonder. [He covers Lady Sumner's body with her cloak. Then he takes from his breast-pocket a long sheath-knife. Now for my message. [Goes out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V Scene: The stage of the Grosvenor Theatre. The curtain is down. Scene-shifters struggle with wrecked scenery, and Property-men carry out broken furniture. On the left, his head supported by Europa Troop, St. James's lies unconscious: two Doctors attend him. Sir Tristram, whose clothes are torn and whose face is bruised and bloody, is talking with Mark Belfry on the right. The Orchestra is playing fortissimo. Above the music an occasional whistle or cry is heard as the last of the audience leave the theatre. When the music ceases Warwick Groom enters on the left, and waits his opportunity unseen by the others. Belfry. [Writing with a fountain-pen in cheque-book.] By judgment, instinct, sense and common-sense Deserted! Stagger me, Tristram! What, what? Why, There's reams of print on crowd-psychology, If quarter a century of the footlights left you Ignorant of the hickory-hearted truth That God's the popular voice, the public mind! [Offers Sir Tristram a cheque. You deal? Sir T. [Taking the cheque.] On terms. What play must I produce? Belfry. No terms. [Takes out his pocket-book and writes in it.] I buy the theatre. Take Europa To Monte Carlo, or live a decent life At home here on the balance: it reaches that. I want the Grosvenor. Sir T. Do you meanâretire? Belfry. You hit the white. The man that staged a play To make the Lord sit up in a theatre Isâfundamentally disqualified. The man that stands Mark Belfry's impudence Will take Mark Belfry's money: it never fails. [Tears from his pocket-book the page on which he has been writing and offers it to Sir Tristram. Your signature? Sir T. [Declines the proffered document and tears up the cheque.] No; not for twice the sum. But treble it, and the Grosvenor Theatre's yours. Belfry. I want the Grosvenor. [He writes another cheque and another receipt. Sir Tristram takes the one, endorses it, and signs the other. So? You don't inquire? Sir T. No, Belfry. Belfry. I possess the Grosvenor now, The premier theatre in London. Well, I'm going to change it to a music-hall. Sir T. You won't do that? Belfry. I will. The drama's done. This is a new thing I determine. Say: I've fifty theatres in America, And six in London; and I know. It pays, Variety business pays: the public makes Its entertainment, and it makes it that. Sir T. Drama will flourish while there's love and hate. Belfry. Although you wrote it in all the copy-books 'Twould still be true, Sir Tristramâas true as this, That there must be religion while there's life. But fashions wear, customs and costumes fade, And change comes jesting like a conjurer. The music-hall begins the world again In Anglo-American drama:ânot a joint Of evolution about it; that's to come:â A clean solution of continuity Between the theatre about to be And that which was. Your Bishop knew a thing: It's Matter people want. Spirit's played out For entertainment. Don't attack it, though! You've had a lesson here to-night to last A year or two. Sir T. I shall not now retire, But build another theatre. Death or life, Labour or leisure balance the scales: again A splendid stage, a strenuous time, because You purpose to undo the thing I did. Belfry. Build me a dozen, and I'll buy them all, And fill them nightly with variety shows: I'm at the heart of this and understand. Sir T. You don't believe this, Belfry? Belfry. Don't I? Say: You reckon that your English Church is dead Three hundred years or so, for all the state It keeps, the wealth it grips? Sir T. As dead as Pharaoh; A mummy spiced and gilded. Belfry. So's your drama! I've heard you say it, and you know it's true; The play to-night allowed itâthe prologue did. Theocracy and theatrocracy: The one long dead; the otherâ Sir T. Well? Belfry. Stillborn! Two things there are alive in England now, As red as blood, as hot as fire: your crude Salvation Army and your Music-Hall. The first's no trade of mine; the other is; And here's my theory of it. Your civilization Evolves as barbarism in modern cities, A highly decorated barbarism. Your houses are merely wigwams where you sleepâ Sometimes. You dine abroad in crowds; then lug Your indigestion to your music-hall To drowse and smoke at ease. A play demands A little intellectâwhich you hate to use: Your music-hall assails your muscles mainly, With ground and lofty tumbling, gymnasts, tramps, Antipodists, weight-lifters, wrestlers; tricks That gibe at gravitation; monkeys, dogs; Illusions; jugglers, bipeds, quadrupeds; Prodigious force and skill of man and beast, Trained effort and sustained the savage loves And feels his muscles pacified to watch. The muscle business first: then comic turns; Singers and dancers, bounders, jesters, cranks, That make your savage laugh: he loves to laugh; For what's your laughter but a free discharge Of muscular energy under a pleased Constraint. As for his slumbering fantasy, The multitudinous rhythm and massive hues Of Leicester Square's magnific ballets flood The channels of his sense with undefined Voluptuousness: your savage loves to dream Obscure delights, uncertain glories. . . . What! I tire you, Tristram? But I like the theme; It takes me by the throat. Sir T. The music-hall Is utterly obscene, a heinous mart Of alcohol and meretricious flesh. Belfry. A prime, barbaric entertainment, fit For gorged barbarians! Sir T. But the theatreâ Belfry. Extinct: an anteroom to the nursery; Annex to the lecture-hall; a mothers' meeting; A kindergarten: men forsaken it quite. Out of the music-hall a drama springs, NaÃ¯ve, natural, splendid; hidden, impossible, But happily conceived when he arrives Who shall beget it. You talk of messages, Of orientation: there's my Yankee miteâ A budding drama in the music-hall. I think I've read somewhere that once before Dramatic monologue became a playâ When Aeschylus turned up in Attica! You grant the halls are fairly Dionysianâ Groom. [Stabs Sir Tristram.] I thought of this upon your wedding-day, And every summer since. Sir T. [Falls] Help, Hildreth, help! Belfry. [Seizes Groom, who makes no resistance] You murdering hound! WhyâGroom! Of all men, Groom! Prince of good fellows and of actors! Groom! Enter Hildreth, Salerne, and Abbot. Their clothes are torn and their faces scratched and bruised. Hildreth kneels by Sir Tristram. Salerne and Abbot take charge of Groom. Hildreth. Tristram! My friend! My chief! Sir T. Hildreth! Good lad! Europa. You fool; you dull, dull groom! Let me; let me! [Europa and Hildreth support Sir Tristram while one of the Doctors attends to his wound. Tristram, you need me now! Sir T. Europa! Yes; I love to have a woman near me.âDeath, Sudden as I desired: but one regretâ One only; my theatre. If you had struck Before I sold it! Groom. Curse me, can't you, Tristram! Belfry. [To himself] He'll want the bargain cancelled. Shall I? No; I need the Grosvenor, and the Grosvenor's mine. [Goes out quickly. Sir T. [Giving Hildreth the cheque] Yet I die solvent, Hildreth. Belfry's cheque: It rings a merry peal. UnlessâBy Heaven! Belfry, you'll not exact this now! Hildreth. He's gone, Sir Tristram. Sir T. Fearing the appeal of death, I verily believe.âA music-hall? It matters nothing what comes after me: I had my day. Groom. Abuse, deride, provoke Me back to madness: thought and deed are seas Asunder: I would lay my own life down Not to have struck. Machines we are, wound up To weave we know not what. I languish now Like wing'd exasperation that expends A virulent dart, and, hebetated, dies. Enter Temple. Temple. Sir Tristram! Where's my master? Salerne. Silence, fool! Temple. But something terrible has come to pass. Sir T. Something extravagant since Temple shouts. Temple. Are you dead also, sir? Sir T. Not dead yet, Temple. Who else is dead or dying? Is Gervase gone? 1st Doctor. The Bishop breathes again; but cannot live, Though consciousness returns. Sir T. Lay me beside him: We two should die together.âLet Temple speak Before you move me.âTemple, what's the matter? Temple. Your lady, sir; she's dead; and on the floor I found this vial. Sir T. She lies at peace? Temple. She seemed Asleep. I tiptoed to the dressing-room Afraid to wake her. Then I felt a ghost Or something near me. Peeping out, I saw No motion on the couch; the lady dead, Her face like paper and her lips all blue. Groom. I saw her die as sweetly as she lived, A sacrifice forlorn. She should have been A worshipped wife, a mother guarded close With children: what she was we made herâyou And Iâ Sir T. Enough of that! Groom. Enough; it serves My purpose gallantly! I feel again The murderer in my nerves, not to be purged Until the rope swings taut: out of the earth, Through the foundations of your theatre, It mounts into my brain, a seething fire. How good it was to kill youâyou that stood Between me and the world! Sir T. You took your chance With others. Groom. No; I left it all to chance, And trusted to my genius. Sir T. I relied On friendship and the world's goodwill. Groom. Cheats, both! You were my friend, and therefore you betrayed me; Only a friend it is that can betray; And every friend's a traitor, first and last. Sir T. Friendship and treachery synonymous? Mine was the stronger nature. Groom. The craftier! You stole my love, you robbed me of my place, Applause, consideration, ease, renown, Riches and power that come of eminence; And this you did by every mean deviceâ Sad revelation, innuendo, shrug, Suggestive pity, supercilious smileâ Sir T. And you? Groom. Oh!âI . . . I was magnanimous: I wished to kill; but to the very last Hugged the idea of a great eclipse Of you and yours to send you sighing down The bitter road, my foot upon the neck Of all your fame. Sir T. You lost the hope of that? Groom. Therefore I struck. Sir T. A candid murderer. Groom. Men Should kill each other. God, how it satisfies! 2nd Doctor. You must not talk, Sir Tristram.âWill you remove That most unhappy man? [Salerne and Abbot, attended by Blyth and Boulder, who have entered, take Groom up stage. Groom. Murder him; stab The intimate friend, the inevitable foe! I shall proclaim it from the prisoner's dock: This is a gospel worth a thousand lies Of tolerance and love. Did men cut off The troublers of the world offence would cease. When bland dissimulation paves a way With broken pride that was its honest peer, And chuckling craft destroys us unperceived High time it is for men to kill outright! [Groom is taken out. St. J. What dreadful voice is that? 2nd Doctor. A murderer's. St. J. Whose? 2nd Doctor. One Warwick Groom. St. J. The actor, Tristram's friend? 2nd Doctor. The same, my lord. St. J. Whom has he slain? 2nd Doctor. His friend. St. J. Is Tristram dead? Sir T. I lie here dying, Gervase.â Ah! Ah! Why torture me! I cannot live. 1st Doctor. It is the order of our artâ Sir T. Desist! Desist, I say, at once; and damn your art.â Pardon me, Doctor: I never could endure A scratch with patience: let me die at ease. 1st Doctor. I might preserve your life a little while. Sir T. How long?âReply! 1st Doctor. I cannot say. Sir T. A year? 1st Doctor. Oh no! Until the morning at the most. Sir T. Take me to Gervase, Hildreth: quickly, Hildreth. [Hildreth, Europa, and the Doctors bring St. James's and Sir Tristram together, and support them, that they may see each other while they converse. They've killed you, Gervase. St. J. I wished to set them free. This war will last a thousand years. Sir T. For us The war is over: notwithstanding, speak Your errand once again. Things in my life There are I would forget: your message wipes The world out. St. J. All the past, both good and ill, My message clears away. Sir T. Leaving pure Matter: I love it!âAnd a world begun anew: That moved me most of all:âto launch the world In space again upon a virgin track, As though the foul old rut and blood-drenched way Had never been. I feel it, as I die, So deeply: actual world, and actual man. St. J. Yes; let us watch that man! I see him stand In majesty material, the Nessus-shirt Of spirit, warp, and woof of legend dyed In many-coloured Sin, the mordant shame That cankered life, and clung, a grafted hide, About his innocent flesh, fallen off, or flayed With hideous woe, and in its proper filth Corrupted into naught. Forthwith the world Begins again, not even a pallid dream Of legendary pasts to cloud the dawn. I say it simply;âWith the Universe Man clothes himself; arrayed in time and space, In darkness and in light, no lamp, no gleam He follows, for the sun illumines him, And every sun, his kinsmen in the skies, The systems, constellations, galaxies. At home in the empyrean, issuing thence, His free imagination momently Remembers flame pellucid, which it was, And will be in the nebula again, When all the orbs that stock the loins of night Return into the sun, and fill with seed Of chastest fire the impassioned womb of space. Sir T. We fill the abyss, left in the Universe By cancelling God, with the Universe itself. Great is it, Gervase; but the terror of it! St. J. Terror and splendour, Tristram! Who shall tellâ Who shall persuade the kings that God is not, The politicians, usurers, financiers, Priests, warriors, that depend on God to bear The burden of their inhumanities? All inhumanity that flings itself On God's unsearchable device will fight To the last drop of blood, last labouring sigh For God and Heaven and Hell. And who shall teach The orphans that their mothers are not; who Unpeople Heaven of lovers, children, saints? Women will fight with babies at their breasts, Old palsied hags, peace-lovers, cripples, cowards, When this is put to war. Their sons that died In battle, where are they? Their enemies That should lament in Hell? The little child That lived a year and holds its parents' hearts In dimpled hands for ever? Christ himself That pardoned wanton women, where is he? Sir T. It cannot be undone! St. J. It can, it will! For through the mist of tears and blood I see A greater breed of men, a nobler world, An independent power in the Universe, The Universe itself become aware. Sir T. The Universe itself become aware. [Neither speaks again, and shortly both die within a few moments of each other.</field>
