      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I Jericho: the garden of the royal pleasure-house. In front a bathing-tank; above it terraces masked by balm-shrubs. A voice is heard calling: Mariamne! Mariamne! Can she have slipped down from the parapet? [Herod is seen through the branches. Herod. Or has she crept to the smooth tanks to breathe The air of the water? No, the bathing-tanks Are guarded for some sport, [Cries and laughter of unseen swimmers. And there is congregation on the shores. If she could know, if she could but conceive! A moment's absence tightens all my breath! Mariamne! Mariamne! How often I evoke her to the echo! Mariamne! Very oft I call down to my soul to her, and there She answers in abundance, as the corn That the large waters woo to sudden tilth. I would that she were only in my soul! . . . On every element I call to do her injury. . . . I love her The way I hate a foe I cannot strike. [The sound of laughter and cries is now close. My Gauls at play!â [To a boy, who rests on the edge of the tank. Child, you are bathing? Child, To watch your seats! Aristobulus. But I must rest a little. Herod. Lay your clothes on you; rest within my tent. Aristobulus (laughing and pointing to the Gauls). Not while this rank of glittering teeth and eyes Is fastened on meâno! Your Gauls can swim; they challenge, Till I am turned to dolphin, or a boat Shot by PhÅnician skill to sea. Their challenge Must have a royal answer. I must triumph, Must I not, Herod?âor my royal blood Were undistinguished in this drowsy pool. I rest for safer triumph. Then to dive Under the water and there hear the shouts Of the people who applaud my art and worship Outside my crystal walls! Herod. Are you a god? I sometimes fear that you may be Apollo. Caress me, O my dear! You sail away? [Aristobulus dives. Herod gazes out as if he had lost something. Aristobulus (reappearing at Herod's feet). Ha, brother!âthis my homage. Herod. O plunged swan, Is this your homage? Dive down in the water! You dazzle me too much. Aristobulus. I am scarcely breathed. Herod. No. . . . I would have you, all your beauty, held Safe down in yonder crystal. I would hear No more of homage, triumph, god or man, Ambition, rivalry. I would stoop down, And hear the pond lap over you, and know Your sovereign, lovely body safe beneath. Safe . . . Do you stare? Ay, safe as gods are in their hyaline, Assuaging and eternal, armed with distance As with a silver mail. . . . Aristobulus! A perfect priest and king for shawms to greet, But in retirement, safe. . . . Aristobulus!â And only mine. [He bends above Aristobulus. . . . You are her very image. Why have the sons and daughters of old kings These lids, this arrogance of lip? My wilful, Why do you lie and rest so in the sun, Idling your powers away? [To certain of the Gauls, who have been following his every word and motion. Dive, dive! My Beauty, Have you no breath for this? . . . The smiling water Must be your elementâto play with it, As birds play with the air around. Delicious The water and the musky scents! [They remain still and enjoying. Aristobulus. See, Herod, Your divers reappear. Herod (hastily rising). You love the water! I am jealous. Drink, Drink of it till you are a very god! [He watches the bubbles on the surface of the water, then climbs the terraces. Close-covered as the dead be those I love . . . Sunk down, and to the source Of my desire. . . . Death, death! [His voice rolls out like a peal of low thunder in a radiant sky. Scene II Masada, by the Dead Sea Alexandra and Mariamne. Mariamne is sitting listless. Alexandra approaches her with jewels Mariamne. I will not give him pleasure. Alexandra. Child, He is parting from you; he may not return. [Mariamne stares fixedly in a mirror. What is it? A bloom is on your beauty like the dew. What is it? [Queen Alexandra looks into the mirror. Mariamne. You behold! Alexandra. My beauty, my heart's fashioning, my jewel . . . A little pale, fairer about the eyesâ My daughter! Mariamne. Noâyour son, your murdered son. He beckons me each time I face the mirror; He comes up from the water through the metal; He shines distorted . . . Alexandra (clasping Mariamne). Hush! Mariamne. He comes to me . . . For we are children, for we love each other. He tells me all his secrets; I have this. My heart is with him. How can you forget? Alexandra. Child, you must come to take the scent of blood As simply as it were the scent of roses. Grow winsome to your husband, give him pleasure: All sullenness in woman is defeat. . . . [She draws her daughter again to her side. How can you see down to the heart of things? You must have many secrets yielded up, Not one, if you would move soft-footedly About the world and sway it to your will. Listen a little. . . . You are hard, you took No heed of Herod at the funeral. . . . Mariamne. That he should weep! He moved you by his weeping. It is the ghosts that move me, and the ghosts Alone that I can comfort. They are helpless As children, and they cry to me; the old Cry to me as the youngâmy grandfather Murdered by Herod and my brother murdered. Alexandra. Child, you are very deaf to human sounds; You are yourself a ghost, a mystery, Almost to me who bore you, a dismay. What would you haveârevenge? [Mariamne shakes her head. Mariamne. There, mother, deck me With these long chains and chains. [Alexandra adorns her with ropes of pearls and amethysts; Mariamne looks up at her mother and smiles. How do men love? Alexandra. They love a little while: they love but beauty. Mariamne (gazing into the mirror). Oh, then, I have no fear: I am eternal. [Queen Alexandra's face glows as Mariamne rises. Herod enters. Herod. Mariamne! [He pauses, bowing profoundly to Queen Alexandra. Alexandra. Son, I have dressed her for you, have perfumed And dressed her. Herod. You have dressed her as a queen, Queen Mariamne. Alexandra (with deep obeisance). I yield now my place; And blessing on you, blessing! [Herod bows again and watches the Queen retire, staring blankly as in a trance. Herod. Mariamne, I have been musing. . . . How shall I bid farewell? You are shaken. Speak! If I died from you . . . and to Antony I pass, to my extremest foe, to peril Of my fortune and my lifeâsay, can you live? [Mariamne is silent. (Softly, in her ear.) My flower! death may be painless, sudden, joyous, A wafting into bliss. Mariamne (speaking as if from sleep). There is drowning. . . . No, I would not drown myself; I would not you should order me that death. Herod. My flower!âyour death? I am thinking of my death and of your tears. Mariamne, would you live When my great love to you is dumb? Mariamne. I love The dead so dearly! Herod. Could you mourn me, then, Life-long, shut in this fortress of Masada? Could you make all its walls a lamentation? Mariamne. I never shall lament the deadâmy days Were a long mourning if I mourned the dead. Herod. Beloved, my bitter-herbs, my sacred feast, Be not too bitter! Mariamne. I have many tears: My mother says that I must dry my tears. Herod. A smile, that is the shadow of a bird In a deep poolâbut still a smile! Blest be your mother; I will leave you with her. Mariamne. She hates you: do not leave me with my mother. Herod. I will leave you with my sister, for she loves me. Mariamne. Salome? Does she love you? Herod. Sweetness of flowering vineyards on your voice! My wine in flower, are you but flower? A dream? [With a gesture toward the plain of the Dead Sea. Desert acacias, desert spring! O Mariamne! [Round every hill and cranny the words are murmured in confusing mockery, until distinct in every syllable they are returned. Mariamne comes up to him and takes the fringes of his robe in her hand. Mariamne. Yea, my lord? Herod. Mariamne, Your touchâmy cheek, my neck! You shall not finger The tassels of my tunic as a slave. [Laying her head back on his arm. O my JudÃ¦a, I fable to your people I was born Of Jewish race from BabylonâI fable! Here, in the austere country of my fathers, And with your tendrilled face upon my arm, I do not juggle. I am a son of Esau, Who has snatched back again his riven blessing From Israel. O garden of your land! If I should die . . . I have never spared . . . Mariamne, Can I spare? . . . O garden of your land, is this surrender? Is this thyself? Abandnoment of love!â A swoon! . . . Salome! Re-enter Queen Alexandra with Joseph She is gone! Alexandra. You have killed her? Herod. No. Alexandra. Lift the pearls back from her throat. (To Joseph.) Fetch cordials. [Exit Joseph. What have you done? Herod. 'Midmost of my caress She sank my arm . . . Revive her, bring her back! Alexandra. Lift her, and let me take her to my lap. Herod (snatching a phial from Joseph's hand). Dew on her, dew! [He wildly scatters the cordial over her as if scattering incense. Alexandra. Let her not wake and see your face. My daughter Is fragile, your embraces, Herod, too fervent. See, her colour comes. Kiss her as you would kiss a babe asleep . . . Rise softly, very softly step aside. [Herod kisses Mariamne, and then withdraws to the entrance of the room, where he whispers to his brother-in-law. Herod. Joseph, you are her guardian. You reply For her as would a common sentinel; And as I have commanded be it done. Joseph. To the extreme of your commands, my lord And brother. God be with you! Herod. God with her! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I Alexandria. The palace of the Ptolomies. Cleopatra sits on her throne, her chin deep in her hand, her eyes narrow as a crocodile's on the top of the water. Charmian fans her. In the foreground, to the left and right, groups of women and eunuchs are just seen. Charmian. Madam, what is it you are coveting? [Cleopatra is silent. Charmian fans for a while in silence. Madam, your sighs are for the world? Such sighs! Not as the winds that rise and fall again On their own breath, but rather hurricanes That go forth over provinces and kingdoms! Are they for Persia? [Cleopatra does not answer. Noâthen Araby, The desert-brazier, sand and spice together? . . . For Ethiopia and the amber streams, Or Syria's merchant coasts? . . . Or for JudÃ¦a's milk and honey, Egypt Has ever coveted? Ah, madam, madam! They are for Jericho. So often laying Your myrrhs and balsams to your flesh, you quarrel With the poor jars that are your sole possession, While the myrrh-bearing, balsam-scented city Stands alien by its waters. Jericho! [Cleopatra slides her eyes towards Charmian. You are grown still, you do not eat. I fear you. Cleopatra. Seleucus! [Her eyes wake and glitter as her treasurer enters. Did you find a hoard of money? And had the goddess jewels? Seleucus. Tremblingly We crept about the temple in the dusk, Sepulchral hours, between the nadir darkness And dawnâwe dared not light a lamp. Cleopatra. You found? Seleucus. This gold. Cleopatra (trying it in her hand). Loaden with joyâSeleucus! And the jewels? Seleucus (untying a striped silk). These rubiesâpearls from off their string. . . . Cleopatra. The gold Build up in your rock-treasuries and seal. These in my lap to feed me as with music! [Exit Seleucus. See my red roses, Charmian; see My lilies in this basket . . . [The gems lie in the hollow of her knees. And my dew Of a whole daydreak. Ha, what pilfering Of Heaven! Poor Isis! [She covers the jewels with her hands. Charmian. Have you no alarm? Madam . . . the goddess! It is daylight nowâ Her ravaged image . . . Cleopatra. Blasphemy!â Her image! This veil embraces me, and it is mine, To the finest dint of the templesâI am Isis, Soothing her jewels with my hands. Behold them! [Plunging her hands into the mass. These do not faint, nor fleet, nor fadeâbehold, Pale are my fingers from this luxury And contact as they pat the crystal flesh Of all this light and bloom a-dangle. (Settling herself.) Peace To one desireâbut one! Charmian. Unbosom, Queen! I fear you . . . The passion of some great aggrandisement Contracts your face. Cleopatra. Chick, I will not unbosom. I will be wary as the very young, Who speak aside in tremblings of the blood, And change the jewels in their eyes, and let Their love sweep past in havoc on their cheeks, Leaving all clean. Alexas (advancing). The Tetrarch of JudÃ¦a! [Cleopatra motions he shall be admitted. Herod enters and salutes her. Herod. I come with a petition To your great Majesty. I crave a ship To bear me swift to Rome. [Cleopatra is silent. Cassius was mine, My friend, and dearly favouring me. I go To seek my pardon of his conqueror, Now Cassius is dead . . . You are mute, madam. I speak as kings to kings . . . (With a changed voice.) I crave a ship To seek my pardon of Mark Antony. Will you not speed my sails? Cleopatra. You crave a ship. If I should give you a full-freighted vessel . . . Oh, you are easily content! I thought You had ambition. Herod. I must sail to Rome: My fortunes hang upon my speed. Cleopatra. O puppet, Frank-spoken babe! And how will you achieve? Will you malign dead Cassius? Herod. My terms Are proffer of a service of the girth I stretched to my dear friend, dead Cassius. My prelude will be praise of Cassius. Cleopatra (to Charmian and her women). Have you considered himâthis lofty IdumÃ¦an, This Tetrarch who is Tetrarch on the ruins Of the old royal house? How soaringly Composed the bushy blackness of his hair! How he aspires! Behold him Suppliant to me and suppliant for a ship! [She rises suddenly, and all the goddess's jewels fall about her with the sound of hail. The women and eunuchs go down on their knees. 'Tis death to touch one droplet. Call Seleucus To number them and dress them on a dish. (To Herod.) If I should give you a full-freighted vessel . . . I will not: you must take another boon. For you shall be the Captain of my forces, My Ethiopians, Numidian bands, My varied hosts from Syria and from Gaul. My hosts with intermingled tongues shall learn Your watchwords, your command. Now ask as greatly As I confer. Be level with us, Herod. The sports of royalties are royal sports. So modestâso the Jew! [Caressingly catching at one of the chains hung about his neck. And Mariamne Despises you, O Splendour of the Desert! Will you be as the thick-tiÃ¤red Romans, Who can take ship, reluctant as Ãneas, Swift ship to Rome? Will you not stay awhile, My cavaliering Herod? This impatience Is of the wilds. . . . Will you not stay With Cleopatra? This is her petition, Coupled with angry and forbidding tears. Herod. Queen, I must follow, where your heart is gone, To Antony. I am unfortunate In such deep need of pardon. [Seleucus re-enters. Cleopatra. Antony Is here, and all your grace. Herod. You are all bounty, all forgiveness, madam! For you and your august protection, tribute! The honey of a provinceâfor the ship That you will grant my need, since I must sail. [He lays a heavy purse in her hands. Cleopatra (holding it out). Seleucus, tribute! [She lays it on the great dish amid the pearls and rubies. Exit Seleucus. I will send my letter By post as swift as Auster. Have no fear. Mark Antony to kiss the manuscript Would diadem you king of all JudÃ¦a. . . . Come, closer. . . . All your secrets Are cherished in my bosom. Alexandra Has wept me all her wrongs. . . . Herod, there are Soft deaths that buoy our ruleâa priest's, my brother'sâ Scarcely fifteen. And on your side a priest, Almost a brother, in the dawn of youth, They say, has died from you. . . . Are you so angry? Do not be angry! Hush! Out of the clay of Nile our lotus-flower Lifts a perfumed and mitred face. Fear me notâI can cover many sins. Herod. Why should I fear you? I have naught to fear From women's machinations or their wiles. If you will grant no shipâmy way to Rome Is by the sea. . . . Farewell! [He turns to the door. Cleopatra (to Charmian). He does not fire; he is a beast and slow, A sullen beastâan elephant Of drowsy mood. . . . What shall I put before him, What blood of mulberries, what blood of grapes, To rouse his blood to answerable tides? Herod, come back! My Captain Herod. . . . Do you see the storm? Even as a sorceress I know our winds; This storm will wreck you. Herod. I am bound for Rome, No peril on that voyage! What command, What message shall I bear to Antony? Cleopatra. Is Antony away? Herod, my fleets shall dance into the port, Soon as the waves grow small to ripples, soon As the air floats again: you shall have choice Of all my painted sails. Embark not now, Not now . . . [Herod flees. [A whirlwind enters the palace. (Calling after him.) Ãneas! Nay, No Roman! CÃ¦sar, Antony, Pompeius!â No Roman!âGone Away, as from the wife of Potiphar, From me, from Egyptâme! Alexas! heigh, Alexas! [He comes to her. Have they yet strangled us the Jewish slave Of Antony's, who spurned our image? No? Then strangle us the slave as with our hands. [She shrieks. Light! Swing the curtains! Light! [The curtains are swung wide. Am I turned owl? It hurts me . . . Nakedness! My ceremonies gone! [The curtains are drawn round. A stifling darkâsuch heat! (In a whisper.) Bid them fetch snow From the Moon-mountains, where I may conceive The snow eternal. Let my coursers strain South to the mountains, and should any fall, Leave them to starve! Snow from the mountains, snow! Charmian, if I fail . . . Time is so slack. . . . Bring me cyprinum-oil to turn my senses Hard, lest I faint and die . . . A strong scent! . . . Jasminum! [She lies back among her cushions, covering with each hand the gold stars embroidered on each breast. Scene II Rome Herod, with Mark Antony and Octavius CÃ¦sar, stands on the steps outside the Capitol. Octavius. Have no disquiet. Your simple speech of love for Cassius Is as a kingdom's birth to youâso royally Should faith be nurtured, and a feeling brain. Antipater, your father, was the friend Of Rome through a whole lifetime; and your faith Has not removed from Rome, though Cassius shed The noblest Roman blood. Antony. But, Herod, letters Are come from Cleopatra that attaint Your virtue and your mercy. Herod. Wah!âwhat charge? Antony. That tacitly you killed Aristobulus. Sweet-lipped, assailing boyâwhy, his rose-picture Had pleaded to old Fate. Herod. And you believe it? A mother's grief darkened and spread Out of its night this dreamâas women show Ever a pregnant grief. The child was drowned In sport with others, challenged headily By emulation. I had clothed him priestâ High-priest of Israel. Antony. He was the last Of kingly breeding. Herod. Mariamne's brother. Antony. By heaven! their dam sent me their portraits onceâ A girl and boy to smite their sorcery On the taut senses. Herod, you are crowned In Mariamne. Herod. She is royal. Antony. She is fairer Than any breathing. Octavius. Cleopatra, hear! Antony. Let her be deaf as ostrich of the sands! She is not fair, ye godsâshe is complete, And fast as Circe on her worshippers. (To Herod.) You paused in Egypt? Herod. True; But did not know the queen my enemy. Anthony. She wants JudÃ¦a. Herod, You shall not, on my word, be dispossessed. And, if Octavius smile, your Tetrarchy, Since you aver Aristobulus' death To be of chance, and sorrow to your heart, Shall be returned to you a kingdom. Octavius. Ay, King of JudÃ¦a! Antony. Give to Mariamne A king for her embracesâwomen glow Their arms round sovereignty. Herod. My faith is sure. And it is great to know where greatness sways, To take its current. All magnificence Isâjourneying with the greatness of oneself, Or destiny's or God's. Fair-valed JudÃ¦a Shall become Roman and attain the world. Octavius. A compeer, Herod! Well that Cleopatra, Behind the lasting walls of Egypt, drew you Into no sunned captivity. Ha, ha! She is a mighty idler. Antony. She so covets Fair-valed JudÃ¦a, you, it seems, had welcome Of bitter flavour . . . so the letter vouches. But I shall value faith and governance Out in the boist'rous Orient of the Jews. Ah! has she faith or governance, this queen, Save as a dusky Venus? (To Herod.) Well? Herod. Mark Antony, the truth I gave dead Cassius I plight you in the East: arms, treasure, victuals, Beyond my kingdom's tribute, shall be yours. [They join hands. Octavius. Come down with me! You have been asking for the webs of Cos, Tissues of Indian byssus. We have stalls In the Forum Pacis and the Via Sacra Worth a king's visit. [Lepidus comes out of the Capitol. Ay, there, Lepidus. This is the daybreak of a sovereignty; Herod is monarch of the Jews. Lepidus. Brave Herod! Salve, Herodes! Then we must banquet him. [They move down the steps, leaving Antony. Octavius. We are going to buy stuffs. Lepidus. Not Antony? Octavius. No, Herodâwhere I bought but yesterday . . . Lepidus. Not for Scribonia; for Nero's wife, Livia Drusilla . . . Octavius. Where I bought a veil. Herod. This broad and pillared Rome!â My Jewish cities Are lowly scattered . . . Antony (calling). Herod! (To Octavius and Lepidus.) Go your way; Herod will followâhe is swift of foot, An antelope. [They descend. Herod! Herod. What would you? Antony. See, I have given you a realm to gild the pleasure Of Mariamne . . . and have seen your eyes Travel in royal progress far away. I know . . . but, man, I have displeased a queen, Defied her letter: I must give her sugars And incense to appease. . . . Necessity Shears you of Jericho. Herod. The plots of balm!â There only in the world? Antony. And you must lose The towns within the river Eleutherus. I am ashamed, but the necessity Is hotter than my blush. Herod. Your will! [He walks abruptly away. Antony. A man Of the Lions' Country! . . . She shall have six cities. Six?âSeven; two pearls from Persiaâand a letter! Scene III A hall in the royal house of the Asmoneans at Alexandrium Salome is seated, weaving a scarlet girdle. Herod enters. Taking Salome's hand, he sweeps her along with him as he crosses the apartment. Herod. There is a pearl, as somewhere in the sea There is a pearl the diver does not find, Strains for in blindness, gropes for in the dark! The diver rises bleeding for the air . . . Sweet, will you aid me? Sweet, there is no treasure I lacked in boyhood that your love attained not. Win me her love, This Mariamne, till she love as thou, Down where there is no speech. She is withholden. Salome, I beseech her at your hands! [Pushing her away. Salome, I so fear to look on her . . . (After a pause.) Oh, it would kill her To spread before her vision, even in cleft, The wealth she ownsâfor gold we toss about As merchandise, for gold we twist in chains What is it to the lumps of heavy gold Stored hidden under river-beds, beneath Fountains, the roots of crags? Nor could she know I shut her in my fort, no element Around but the Dead Sea, that she might gather My vision on its glass, and dream my dreamâ A nest of phÅnix not less full of life, Of comforting, of cheer Or perfume than to die with him she loves. Salome, can she learn That she must die with me, beside my death, That I must feel her drawing close to me, To the same quiet, side by side? Salome, I have such fear she of herself would rather, I being dead, 'mid changes, far apart, Spend all my wealth on some Mark Antony, Some sharp-set prodigal of Rome . . . [Joseph opens the curtain and Mariamne enters, dressed in mourning. But this . . . Joseph, you lead our queen Forth in this sombre, grave attire? Joseph (with deep obeisance). Her pleasure; For when we told her of your sovereignty, Swift as a heron she would speed to you. [Herod dismisses Salome and Joseph with a wave of his hand; he looks long at Mariamne for recognition; she gives none. Herod. So swift to draw to me, my bird . . . Mariamne, And you have journeyed day and night? So farâ We come from very far . . . it startles us. And you were so in haste you would not stay To robe you for your crown? Queen Mariamne, The kingdom of the Jews is thineâKing David Wore of God's oil, thy fathers of their sword. I have won it for you: it is all my bliss, I am a king to you. No salutation? But will you make me an idolater, Thus kneeling to an image? Mariamne, So to repulse! . . . Nor speech that is my bread, Nor any looks that feast me, nor those motions Conscious with knowledge of my watching eyes, Nor any preparation of your beauty, No forethought, nor misgiving. I forgetâ You are born royal, and these added titles Tease you contemptuous . . . Lo, what is this? You are weeping! [He springs to her and kisses her repeatedly. Mariamne. Stay! Herod. Mariamne, Think not to stay my kisses. By thy life . . . Mariamne. My life! If you had not been hereâ Herod. Thou mad one, What hadst thou done? Wouldst thou have loosed a blade and smitten thee, Should I have found thee earth-long in thy blood? Mariamne. No. Herod. Thy wild wordsâ What were they? Mariamne. You commanded I should fall As a brute victim at the sacrifice; Or, chained about your tomb, I had been treated As your camel or your horse, if you had died While journeying from home. Herod. Eyes of the topazes! What dream is this, what dream? Is it because I shut thee in Masada? I had fears, My dove, I had such fears for thee, I shut thee Away as thou hadst not been living. Scarcely I thought, save of the peril. At Masada By the Dead Sea, and girt by sterile land, I knew none could attain to ravish thee. It was the hasteâ It was the careâ You suffered? Sick fancies haunted you? O sweet, but queens In jeopardy are often thus shut upâ Or underground, in towers, or over sea. But you are fallen very white in hue. Your health . . . Mariamne. I have full health. I would not die, I would not be cut off, and all my race Cut off in me. It is not just my thread Of lifeâthere are so many! While I live They live a little with me: they are warmed A little of my blood: I comfort them. You gave command to Josephâ Herod. Ha! Mariamne. He told me You gave him that commandment, and he sworeâ [He turns violently from her, drawing his hands back. Herod. Could he have said it of himself alone? Could he have dared so break his oath? My silenceâ Was it unsealed by him? He broke the seal, He thawed the rigour, and, in little words Of love and of caress, that have no meaning, As in a fairy-tale he told my grief Of how I loved so jealous? . . . and his oath Floating before him as a wisp of straw One laughs to follow as it floats along! . . . He told her, and her lids dropt very deep, And there were signs, and the deep flush, my sign, The quiet, growing rose as at the dusk . . . [Turning again and facing Mariamne. Mariamne, so you pleaded for your life, And you prevailed. Will you not plead with me? Will you not recollect and feign again To me, your husband, with the words you feigned, The love you feigned to love . . . or was the man Beloved, who was your lover? [Mariamne stands quite still. Is this pride? You are a Maccabee, an Israelite, King Alexander's daughterâI of Edom, Descended from a slave of Ascalon, Not to be answered by your royal lips. [Mariamne sighs a little: then, raising her eyes, speaks quietly. Mariamne. How was it drawn from him? As the night comes up into the evening-tide. I was sad, and he was sorrowful to death That he had sworn a cruelty and wrong So unavailing to repent, if done. Spare him, lord, in belief of my clear words. [Herod gazes at her with awe, then muffles his face in his robe, and speaks slowly. Herod. Were you so sad at dying, when to die Was but to rise up at my bidding, Come! Was but to quicken to my cry, Receive me Back in your arms? Oh, you are slow of heart! When I was dying of the pest in Rome, And knew not I should look upon you more, Death was not cold, death glowed with Mariamne. I had prepared her welcome on that shore! [She flashes one rapid glance at him. Mariamne. I will wait you on that shore, my lord the king. Herod (dropping the folds of his mantle). O my gazelle, my noble distance-keeper, Wilt thou indeed await me? Then why tarry? [He strains her to his heart. Mariamne. But do not cast between us any more One that is dead. Spare Joseph, merciful! Herod. The dead between us, Mariamne? Doe Of the high places . . . How? Mariamne. My grandfather . . . [He grips her wrist. (In a whisper.) My brother . . . Herod. Peace! Were you drowning in my arms, Your voice would sink before me so, your thoughts Would drop bewildered so . . . Mariamne (drawing back from him at arm's length). My grandfatherâ My brother! [He watches her as if she were working a spell. . . . I am ready for my death. I have often dreamed itâdeath or sleep, one pillow. Why should I speak of the great ancestors? You did not breathe their life. Why should I speak, Lord Herod, of my state And purpose as your wife? (Hanging on his hand.) Spare Josephâmerciful! Herod (still speaking gently, as he draws her closer). Mariamne, I would reason with you. Speak! I would question the great blood in you: a servant False to his oath, a soldier in accord With foes, a sentinel Who to the nearing spy betrays the pathâ Can such men live? Are they for kings to use? [He has loosed her and she moves away, looking out over the tombs of her ancestors. He follows. Flesh of their dust, pronounce: can such men live?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I Jericho: a court of palm-trees in the royal pleasure-house Cleopatra, dressed as the goddess Isis, Herod and Seleucus Herod. Since you have now returned back from Euphrates, Leaving the Emperor to his wars, in duty I have collected all my rents From your Arabia, about Jericho, And from the Eleutherian citiesâall The districts that I farm of you. Seleucus! Here are the papers. Queen, the sums are here: Twelve hundred talents; six from Araby, Four from these cities, two from Jericho. Cleopatra. No more from Jericho, with that rare drug Of native balsam, and such palms as gender Huge, sable cones of fruit? Herod. The sum! I beg For no deduction, though the locusts nipped Our odorous gardens close, and scarcity Has been upon the palm-yards from the greed Of former and of latter flights in cloud On every smooth wind of the sun-rising. Cleopatra. Your husbandry is sad for me. Seleucus, Take these small payments to our purse. Fie, Herod, Fie! You are niggard in our revenues. [Exit Seleucus with the bags of gold and papers. Herod. I bring you all the farms can yield. Cleopatra. O Herod! I saw you but this morning exercise With spear and darts, as Greek Apollo chose An Edomite to mask in. . . . Herod. Queen of Egypt, I am a Jew of Babylonian race. Cleopatra. Are you, bold, arrowing archer? You so quick Of motion, and quick-sighted at your game Are now but blind. . . . (Close to his ear.) We love you, king of Jewry. As yonder female clusters of the palm Are bound with sprays of blossom for achievement, We would be yoked. So monarchs Make open treaty. Herod. Tangling politician! Ha, ha! A snare! Would you not win JudÃ¦a Out of such wickedness, if I complied With your own sort of pleasures? I have lost These plains and cities that were mine: no further Will I renounce possession, nor will do Despite to Mark Antonius, nor commit Idolatry of Isis. [Wreathing the veil of the goddess round her right arm, Cleopatra throws both her arms back and laughs in Herod's face. Enter Alexas. Cleopatra. Ho, Alexas! And with an onyx tabletâa love-letter From over crowned Euphrates. [Exit Alexas. Antony Is liberal and kingly; what he lays Before my eyes is legible on crystal, A sheet of snowy crystal or bright onyx. [Lifting the tablet. This is Arabian stone . . . We will reply across the crowned Euphrates. (To Herod.) Good-bye some little while. [She puts her arms round his neck and kisses him, then moves across the court, rattling her scarabs, to the sound of laughter so low it ends in a moan. Herod. A locust! . . . Would my hands could beat her down! Scene II Jericho: a room in the royal house Herod is seated before a small council-table. Shimaiah, Babbas, and Nicholas are leaving him; then they halt, arrested by the despair of Herod's attitude. Herod. Go from me, Go, Nicholas, Shimaiah, Babbasâall! Babbas. Why shoud I go? I hold you in the right. Cleopatra should be killed. Herod. You hurt the sorest, Mourning with me a mighty deed undone. Babbas. I cannot see: why is it that you falter? There was a quietâsome one at your ear . . . And then your voice came husky, âShe shall live.â My son, she must not live. . . . The murderess Of kindred . . . her young sister. Herod. And her brother Cut off that she might rule. [All are silent. Babbas. She must not live. She is the great Idolatress, she is The centred spot of all corruption. Listen! [Turning to his companions. O Councillors, I listened: Bear with me, for I know when voices travel Beside an angel guiding them along. King Herod summoned us, and spoke so greatly Of the swift deed to do, my heart grew great. For if our God Commands us strictly to a deed, there is No room for doubt or talk. [Herod looks up. This bitter plague Of the whole world is in his power, to kill her, And God has put the judgment in the king To make an end. Nicholas. Rebuke me! It is not that I fear the consequence Of this rash deed: we are the Chosen People, And God can check the Roman armies as He faltered Pharaoh's host . . . It is not thatâ She is his guest. Babbas. By Jael's blow . . . [He struggles with his rage. Herod (rising). Nay, Babbas, I have promised with an oath. [Turning to his chief eunuch. See that the queen be richly served. To-day It is her willâand as you lesson me We must not check a guestâto-day, together, We hunt wild asses . . . Also any object The queen of Egypt may desireâwe all Are tribute to herâpack upon her camels. There, get you gone! [Exeunt all. This would have been the moment of my lifeâ My spotted hero ridded of his plague, And Jewry safe, and all my friendship clear. [He stretches himself wearily; then looks out and perceives Cleopatra. Moving to Mariamne's tent! . . . The harlot put her arms about my neck: If I could boast of this to Mariamne! [He shakes his head and turns away abashed. My dew, my breaking rose! Scene III A tent in the gardens of Jericho; in the midst an embroidery frame Alexandra enters, leaving the tent door open at the back Alexandra (perceiving Mardian and another eunuch at the tent door). Mardian, and you, his fellow, do you whisper? I have green purses in my robe. What news? Your Mistress Egypt couches with our crown? Mardian. Alas, madam, she wonders if CÃ¦sar's love were not a midnight dream; if young Pompey were not a vision of the sleep before waking; and if my lord Antony be not the delusion of noonâso uneffecting is her desire in JudÃ¦a. I think, madam, she means no good to Lord Herod, for she lies with her face between rolls, the matter whereof is pharmacy. . . . I hear her jewels as she moves her head. Sometimes she makes sounds such as we hear under the reeds in a full water. . . . I know their omen. Alexandra. Haâsounds! Mardian. But yet to-day the Lord Herod has given it out he hunts wild asses with her. . . . Gifts are come to her. We know not if the stony places may not persuade himâthe stony places and the chase. Alexandra. Your queen? Mardian. She is tiering and re-tiering her head: she who put on but one headdress for Cydnus must try twenty for a hunt of wild asses. She flings them to the wall and screams; her woman Charmian is pale as if from hours of love with the exercise of this fury. Alexandra. A purse for youâand you. Suck up your news; See me again to-night after the chase. [They move apart, whispering. Judith! [Mariamne's waiting-woman brings in silks and begins to thread them on the broidery-frame. (In her ear.) Your! task? Judith. Madam, it is impossible I should do your bidding, and observe the ways of the Lady Cypros and the Lady Salome. My mistress guards me by her, and she loves that I should play the harp. Alexandra. A fool! [Mariamne approaches the tent. Judith, retire . . . and Mardian with you. [Mariamne bows low to Alexandra, and then embraces her. The servants leave the tent. Mariamne. Motherâ O mother, at your politics! Sweet mother, Why trouble with the ant-heap? You have prayed me To be a comfort to you; let me comfort; Let me be to you as a child in age. Alexandra (pushing back Mariamne's arms). Child, Cleopatra puts you in the shade: Better to see you in a sepulchre. Mariamne (caressingly). Herod comes to me in my tent each evening. Mother, I have no fear of Cleopatra. . . . Alexandra. You have no fear! Child, child, then you are fatal; O child, then you are dead: you ruin others, And you are ruined! Fear is as the homage To Life. All mothers, from the wild fox-bitch And nesting partridge even to her who bore you, Worship their joys with fear. When deadly rumour Of coming and death-belted thunder roves The air, there is a trembling of all trees, All creatures; and a man who conquers, conquers His enemy behind the guard of fear. It is the sovereign instinct, the sad wisdom Fate whispers to the stars that fan our hearts; And if we know not fear our star is sunken. Have fear! or cease to rule, or cease to hope, Or cease to live; . . . you are become as death, You are become the death of all you love. This Cleopatra that you will not fear Is pitied by your husband, and, relenting, He hunts with her to-day. O Mariamne, Take power! If I could see you Like Esther on her throne, as excellent, As savoursome, as subtle in conception Of ways to spread her glory through the land, It would avenge my wrongs! Mariamne. Your son, your priest . . . Alexandra. My priest before Jehovah, my fair priest!â [Holding Mariamne's face in her hands. What would you be, what would you do, what is it That haunts you in the night-time? What delight Would you make solid for me in the earth? Mariamne. Your pleasure, mother; Save that I will not plot against my lord, Save that I cannot fear Queen Cleopatra. Alexandra. Words fall from off your polished head and slip From off your polished gaze and leave you changeless. If Egypt rule your husband we are lost: If you would rise and ruleâ Mariamne. Mother, I rule him. I have no fear. [She sits down to her frame. Alexandra. Fool! I could rend your robeâ Nay, rend my own as at a funeral. Oh, the stiff wing you raise against me, proud! A man's affections are not the whole man: He loved your brotherâ [Cypros and Salome are seen approaching the tent. Loves these alien women: He is a son to one, to one a brother, And he is of their sudden, savage race. [Cypros and Salome enter with effrontery. Have you no greeting, madam, for the queen? Cypros. It is rather she who should bow down before me. Mariamne . . . (taking up a corner of the embroidery) Mariamne, my daughter-in-law . . . This is a fine stitch, Salome; this is a new stitch . . . Mariamne, and the woman my son has made queen! Pretty stitches. And look! our proud lady is broidering a crown with her silks. Alexandra. Woman, what is your business with the queen? Mariamne. Mother, her business is with the stitchery. It is the only business on which we can confer with her. Lady Cypros, do not snatch the pattern. You may take the thing and copy it. Cypros. But Salome does not need to copy it. She has an eye . . . Mariamne. Salome was ever a sempstress. Salome. Ever a sempstress! . . . Mariamne, I have tidings for you. They concern your husband. Mariamne. I am no politician. (To Cypros, who is snuffing a vase of perfume.) Yes, that vase of rich unguents is a present from the Queen of Egypt. Cypros. How she honours you! And she, who is a real queen. (To Salome.) Our perfumes have not this itch of the slime; our perfumes of Arabia are light and dry as the dust of the desert. This is wet; it lurks like the oil some animal secretes in the hidden caves of its body. Salome. Do not breathe it too heavily, Mariamne; it may be poisoned. [Mariamne rises and deeply snuffs the vase. Mariamne. You are right, Lady Cypros, this substance is very choiceâyet familiar. Mother, is it not the same I remember when you returned from Egypt? You brought home seven vials. Cypros. Seven! do you hear, Salome? [Mariamne smiles. Alexandra (to Salome). You are careful of my daughterâyou have tidings. Salome. It is a love-letter, madam, a love-letterâpart of a love-letter! I would acquaint Mariamne with this parchment. I have stolen it; for though it is written to Antony, it is full of the praises of Herod. I may esteem such praises; but to a wife they may prove distasteful. (Reads.) âHe is as a leopard, as a unicorn in his wildness; he pricks me to curiosity and to pursuit as a wild animal; and he is as remote: one must surprise him. Antony, will you hunt me this wild beast, will you draw him into subjection to my pleasure?â [Alexandra opens her hands for the parchment; Salome, closing her hands over it, goes up to Mariamne. You are no politician, and this is of no account. [Alexandra glances at Mariamne, who remains silent. Old Cypros, looking out, sees Herod and Cleopatra pacing together. Cypros. They are just of a height. Alexandra. Mariamne is taller than Cleopatra. Cypros. Mariamne is not taller than my son. Would you say that? Mariamne stoops forward when she walks. I have seen her between Herod and Salome as a gate between two towers. [Alexandra motions to Mariamne to get up. Mariamne (to Alexandra). I have looked down on the jewelled band of Cleopatra's head, when I was standing behind her. I have counted the jewels. There cannot be dispute. [She resumes her seat. Cypros. Can there not, Beauty? (To Alexandra.) It was not for her stature my son chose her; it was for her haughtiness. Mariamne. Stand back, stand further off. You are in my light. Salome. You are speaking to my mother. Alexandra. She is angered for her mother. Mariamne (clutching at her broidery-frame as she rises). You shall be burnt as a witch; you are an idolater! [Cypros, with a muttered imprecation, goes out, followed by Salome, who turns at the door. Salome. She worships incantations of the air, And demons as they flash from evil eyes. She knows there must be many godsâthere must; And but in jealousy you of JudÃ¦a Proclaim there is one God . . . A little nation, It is a little people has one God! . . . The wise know well that there are many gods, Some from the exhalations in the stars, Some from the chinks and crannies in the flame, Some from the rocks . . . [She stops affrighted. But if you say She worships images, King Herod worshipsâ Has he not raised a temple to Apollo, And one to Victory; one to an image Of a winged man, with wings on neck and feet? Has he not raised a temple to the sun? [She goes out breathless. Alexandra passes her hand across her brow. Alexandra. Do you not see? Has nothing changed to you? Mariamne! Mariamne. I dismissed the women, mother. Leave me in peace! Alexandra. They must be all cast out. Salome (returning). Cast out! Burnt as a witch indeed! But it is the king determines our lives and our destiny, and the number of our days must not exceed his own. Ay, Mariamne? His embrace, or the embrace of death? [She goes out. [Alexandra, after a long silence, moves to the tent door, looks round, and returns to Mariamne. Alexandra. They must be all exterminated; vile As Gentiles in the Templeâthe whole race Must be exterminated from the palace, As Maccabees exterminateâcast out! Your children in their place, your Alexander, Aristobulus of the royal names . . . [Enter Herod. He glances quickly at Alexandra, having caught the name Aristobulus. My son, a grandam's babble! Herod (to Mariamne). Cleopatra Is coming to your tent. Mariamne. I will not see her. Herod. You will not see her? All your will in this. No further thought of her! [He turns toward Alexandra, who makes a gesture of despair toward Mariamne, but smiles at Herod, and withdraws. Beloved, I have a suit to you. My mother Complains that you dismissed her. Mariamne. Yes. Herod. Mariamne, Her heart is fixed on me. In all my fortunes She has been true. Mariamne. Herod, I have a suitâ Banish your mother. Herod. Are these lips the same That break in flower so freshly from the cheek? Are these clear eyes Clear after such offence? Banish my mother . . . Banish the pyramids! Mariamne. If they offended. My lord is fond Of clapping into desert fortresses Those he professes dear. The Lady Cypros Is irksome to me. Herod. Then she uttered truth: She said you spoke to her with condescension. Mariamne. There is Masadaâlet her harbour there. Herod. Masadaâare you mad? It were her tomb! (With a low laugh.) Besides, One does not hide one's mother as a jewel That may be stole away. You love your mother? Mariamne. Have you paid Cleopatra all her dues, My subject-king? Herod. I am free of Cleopatra. Mariamne (laying her head on his bosom). If we might be a little to ourselves, And keep our mothers locked in fortresses, One north, one south. Dear, it is irksome to me To hear your mother loves you; it is irksome To hear of you at all. I would be silent Concerning you at all times, for my mother Hates you, and falls into vituperation; I have to close my ears to her: your mother Loves you with praise so fulsome, that again I have to close my ears. I love you best. [She looks up; Herod kisses her. Through the tent door Cleopatra watches like a stone sphinx. Scene IV The same as Act I., Scene I Cleopatra climbs up the steps to a higher terrace where Salome is standing Cleopatra. Salome, how I love him! I am parting Sudden . . . for of this frenzy I shall die . . . He must be loved back where he loves, Salome, Or his great heart will wither on its sands . . . I am troubled for him; he is deadly sick . . . Princess, we must deliver him. Salome. Dear queen, But can he be delivered? Cleopatra. And for ever. [She whispers to Salome, then continues vehemently. No, no! We must not kill herâno! But when she next offends him to the heart So that he loathes her . . . Oh, that we were walking By Nilus' banks, with every instrument Of bale beside us, bale in mud and beast, Engulfing crocodile or asp that sucks, Asp or the armÃ¨d basilisk! My Egypt! . . . She must be found conspiring in her hatred To take his life, in her possession venoms From Egypt . . . and himself shall strike her dead. But we must keep our passion in the dark, And smile upon it to ourselves, As on those gems that lustre in the dark. Salome. But how? Cleopatra. Salome, as migrating birds Arrive, as Nilus swells, you will receive Of me your vengeance: it will overwhelm. Salome (in terror). You love my brother, Cleopatra, love him? Cleopatra. He must be loved back where he loves, Salome. (Faintly.) He is coming through the trees. He is beloved. Salome. No, not my brother, queenâ It is the Asmonean Alexandra Who creeps down to the bathing-tanks alone. Cleopatra. Leave me; I have a word for her; and kiss me, For I am bent on Mariamne's death. [They kiss. Salome. But let me bring you to the water. Cleopatra. No. [Salome climbs out of sight. Cleopatra redescends to where Alexandra, who has entered by the side of the tank, stands above the water, her arms crossed before her eyes. Alexandra (turning). You could not watch down there to find the face Of a dead child. You could not guard your patience. Cleopatra (sliding an arm round Alexandra's shoulders). Gaze steadily, gaze down! King Herod's face is washing with the reeds. Alexandra. You are King Herod's guest: your Anthony, O Cleopatra, Has pardoned Herod. How shall I believe? Cleopatra. There is within my blood such vast abhorrence For him who killed your child, he interrupts My further dreams, he shakes me in my sleep As if I had a conscience. Alexandra, By Nilus he shall die! Alexandra. Has he offended? You have been very slow in taking vengeance. Cleopatra. My soul is fastened on this deed. Now kiss me, For I am bent upon King Herod's death. [Alexandra receives her kiss coldly. You misconceive; you should not misconceive. We have these level natures, you and I, Of grounded politicians; when we smile, The honey is not of the honeycomb. Friend, listen to your steersmate! Seize the courts And the high turrets of Jerusalem When Antony shall strike, and in the name Of the Maccabeans; then Let, as of yore, JudÃ¦a lie at rest On Egypt's old protection. You had given Your son into my breast that I might rear him, As Egypt's Princess reared the Jewish babe. It might not be. . . . Your daughter is foundation, When this false corner-stone, this Edomite Is shattered, for a kingdom of the Jews, As sweet as aspalathus to our hearts. (In a softer voice.) Keep her, then, bitter with the tyranny She bears from this injurious, winding stranger, Whom all Jews hate; whom you, my Alexandra, And I determine ill against, as surely As goddesses hate from their potent altars. Alexandra (suddenly, in a broken voice). I need you, Cleopatra . . . My hopes are dying . . . Mariamne blind, Stubborn of soul, impolitic . . . My days Are as a prisoner's; every day a cell Her husband keeps the key of: I am watched. Cleopatra (tenderly). Your hand . . . for I must lead you from this water That moves a little and exaggerates What comes up through the water. Ah, these balm-yards Of Galahadâenchanted Jericho! Are not my hands Sweet with the sweet plants of the balustrade? Smell them! See yonder A horseman in a whirl-blast of white dust. Who is it? He is carried like a god By clouds . . . Alexandra. It is that murderer. Cleopatra. Not so! His floating mantle fills the solitude. It is some other . . . [She moves away, then turns back to Alexandra, looking beyond her. Pace! [They ascend the terraces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV Scene I In front of the king's house, Jerusalem. Herod, seated on a rock, overlooks the city and the Holy Mount. Blind Babbas stands beside him, moving his hands in the air. Babbas. What do you see? Herod (anxiously). It is not here . . . My noblest monument. Babbas. What do you see, And what is stretched before your eyes? The Temple? . . . Look at it, look up to the little House Of God. . . . That day you stormed Jerusalem You spared the Temple, much as you spared me, Blinding my eyes . . . God's Houseâand I am glad I cannot see itâso you spared my eyes. You face our ruined Templeâwhat beyond? Herod. The Amphitheatre. . . . But it is not hereâ My greatest work! . . . Could you but see! It is the distant spikes, The turrets and the rising fortresses. It is not hereâmy noblest work. Babbas. Beyond The Amphitheatre? . . . Herod. It is yet to build. I can see far beyond, and overarching This petty House of God, as in mirage, And gleaming in the air, a perfect Temple, Costly as Solomon's. It glitters on me With every sunset, white and glittering. . . . [He weeps. And yet I may not enter the fair Courts. . . . A stranger, grape by grape, I have enriched the golden vine that hangs Colossal on the porch. . . . I may not enter the fair Courts. I am An Edomite, a stranger, and rejected. If God would love me . . . If God would set His heart on me! I build Wherever I am loved a monument: And I am filled as is the moon at full, My whole heart in this vision. . . . Everywhere It is myself, and where it most excels, And where I have devised the mystery, I may not look close on my God. Is this A sorrow to you with your open lids? Babbas. I mourn indeed there is no royal priest . . . Without a blemish . . . beautiful. The Temple His own to enter, and he has no place! [Herod stands with fixed eyes. Herod. There is no royal priest . . . And I can never serve as priest. I mourn. Babbas (gently). My son, I see your Temple. It shall rise; You give me fresher sight. [He lays his hand over Herod's. What hurries you? Your skin grows tense. What is it? Herod. Past that rock A single horseman . . . no, a band of horse . . . But one in front more urgent at the gate. They have dismounted. Babbas. Leave me then in darkness. Descend! Herod (who has moved forward, turns back to the old man). We will abide these tidings. [He seats Babbas on a ledge, then strains downward towards the rocky path of ascent. Pheroras! [He embraces his brother, who climbs to him. Ho, Pheroras, your face. . . . Babbas (groping toward Pheroras). Speak! Herod (beating his breast). Not too sudden. Babbas. Speak! Pheroras. Antony is dead. Herod. Mark Antony! . . . [He rends his garment. But I can see him, comfortable, lusty, And all to-morrow his. But I can hear him, The hearty, rallying tones . . . Mark Antony! . . . A voice that had grown soft on woman's love. Pheroras (nodding his head). She died with him. Herod. Of herself chose to die? [Pheroras nods again. Then Antony Gave no commands . . . and yet her majesty She knew was in this action. Antony And Cleopatraâstar on star extinct. . . . They will be buried as one king for ever; And Antony's great error proved the truth. Why are you waiting round? There is no more. These Romans, ah! these fellow-kings, these men Whose breath is on one's cheek, whose eyes are level, Who are as gods, who do not lift one up. . . . Pheroras (shrugging his shoulders). There is no more? We are as fishes cast Out of their element on the hot banks, And like to die . . . Mark Antony, who crowned you, in the dust, And CÃ¦sar . . . Herod. True! You speak the truth: I must go straight to Rome, To CÃ¦sar . . . I will wear my diadem Till Rhodes; then go bareheaded, but with state, To CÃ¦sar. (Suddenly to Pheroras.) Break the news to Mariamne. [Exit Pheroras. (To Sohemus, who, having climbed up, has waited behind Pheroras.) Sohemus, lead this old man down the rocks. When he is safe, return. [Exit Sohemus, guiding Babbas. Babbas (as he disappears). We grope aboutâ Eyes have we and we see not; all of us Are groping on the earth! Herod (calling). Return! And I must give commands . . . for now my death Is moving on, is moving down to me, As sure as an approaching caravan. CÃ¦sar will kill me; it is now my end; And looking down on Pheroras, I see him As a black messenger With tidings of my death to Mariamne, With tidings of her death, for she must be Beside me where I am, and ghost to ghost. The solitude of the new elements Were base without her. I should have no voiceâ All quenched, drowned . . . (With a sudden cry.) Mariamne! O echo, O sure answer back from all The hills she loves! . . . How the earth dotes on her! how the sun follows Her path to dote on her! how her own youth Desires her! how her blood Wooes her as for itself! . . . To check the changes, Season on season, of my apple flower . . . To snap the branch! . . . I'll move from her in secret: I am bearing Her life away. Should I not move in secret? [He turns, hearing a sound, to speak with Sohemus, and faces Mariamne and her sons. Mariamne (presenting her sons). Theseâ For your blessing and farewell. Herod (thrusting the children away). Is it because You cannot say farewell? Or is it you are haunted for my face? Mariamne. My lord, You have sent Pheroras with solemn tidings: He says that you will journey to your death. Herod. Mariamne, but your face is graveâa sky Woven throughout without a seam. What terror Is in your heart? Mariamne. No terror. Herod. And if CÃ¦sar Torment and kill meâah, indifferent As a lotus-flower washed by a bloody current, Indifferent to my death! Mariamne. Farewell, my lord; I did but climb the hill to say farewell, Putting these first that I might be the last. [She kisses him. Herod. Cold hands, cold cheeks! Have you heard, Mariamne, How Cleopatra is at last in peace Entombed with Antony? Mariamne. Your sons, my lordâ These little ones . . . Your blessing and farewell. Herod (blankly staring at her). What will you think of, child, when I am gone? Will you be mourning for me? Will you make Such twilight as should fall before the night? Speak but a little. . . . Shall I go to Rome? Can we thus sever? Speak! Mariamne. But were I CÃ¦sar should I plot your death?â I could not, Herod. It may be he loves you, And cannot of a sudden, seeing you So lusty in your kingship and so full Of joy in all your days, put you to death. CÃ¦sar, be pitiful! Herod. No, no: You will have tidings of my death.âBegone! This is too sharp that you so prize your life, Your life without my love. Where are you passing? What is there for you in my absence?âRancour And all malignity and sullen pangs. . . . Mariamne (as if dazed). Will you be long away? Herod. Would you were dead! And from your eyes you wish it back. This face You leave me with to set up at my prow, This till I die! Farewell! [He leaps down the rock. Mariamne. A murderer! [Instinctively she turns to her children and covers them with her hands and kisses them. [To Sohemus, who ascends.) The king breaks from us suddenly; his children Be in your charge. There, take them, Sohemus! Scene II Masada. Mariamne's old apartment Salome and Cypros Salome. Mother, I am angered against Herod. Cypros. It is my son's will, child. He besought me with the same eyes he lifted for a favour when he was small; he was weeping. Salome. He has banished us to his Masada; we are his captives now. Cypros (laying a soothing hand on Salome). My son has commanded. Let us lie by, like the garments he is not using. [In a low chant to herself. Void we are as the palace that he frequents not, Void . . . but how sudden an outbreak of gems and colour! Say, can there be a woman so girt with gladness? Cypros, safe from his foes thou shalt clasp thy son! Salome. Mother, mother, but you are free in your thoughts! [A eunuch comes and addresses Salome. (To Cypros.) From Egypt; the message is not from Rome. Cypros. Egypt is no land . . . he does not even travel by Egypt. You may talk Egyptian while I am singing to myself. [She is heard as she goes away. Great is he, undiverted, cruel to torture, Wrenching the truth from his tortured; soft to my bosom, Soft to the cries of my bosom as when he sucked. [Meanwhile an Egyptian woman has entered. She salutes Salome, then presents her with a box. Salome. Who art thou? Anake. Charmian's sister. Salome. And thine errand? Anake (pointing to the box now in Salome's bosom). I am Anake . . . Charmian is dead. My sister Charmian! She, too, touched poison. They say it is the same. [She points again toward the box. I am Anake; I tended Cleopatra in the tombs. Salome. How fared she there? She wept for Antony? Anake. She wandered up and down and took no rest, And then she spread her prayers upon the tomb; And it was like the lion round the desert To hear herâI was frighted, for the noise Was never in one placeânow near, now far. . . . My sister Charmian gave this to my bosom. [She bows and turns to go. Salome (detaining her). Anake, you have looked upon her dead. How did those wonderful and perfumed lips Fall into silence? Was her splendour slow In ebbing, as a sunset or the sea? Anake. O Princess, she was marvellous disfigured, For all the fair array she had put on To dazzle CÃ¦sar when he should be brought. Her eyes were sunk far back into her head, For she had wept so sore; her cheeks were cut And frayed up with her nails, as I had seen her Striding her chamber when the fury drove. Salome. For Antonyâwas this for Antony? Then wherefore was she careful of her promise? Why does she crave the death of Mariamne? [Holding the golden box before her eyes. It may be there is poison here for both, For Herod too . . . He shut us in this fortress; It may be he is whispering our death . . . But she shall die the first. If I remove her, And put her beauty from his eyes, perchance . . . There is but one delightâto live with him Again and sole as in our youth together. [A great cry is heard through the passage, followed by wailing. Enter Pheroras and Cypros with a crowd of attendants. Pheroras. Salome, evil tidings. Cypros. He is dead! Herod is dead. [She falls, as if shot. Salome with a sharp cry lays hold of Pheroras. Pheroras. They are come from Rome, just landed. . . . They report That CÃ¦sar tortured him. Salome (looking down at Cypros). She has not heard! [She stoops down and chafes her mother. Pheroras. Killed in revenge, by CÃ¦sar. Salome. Pheroras, You are as in his placeâour Governor. Swift to Jerusalem! Leave us alone. Put out the women. Swift! Scene III Shipboard. Herod and Nicholas of Damascus at the stern of the vessel Nicholas. Dear king, but why so fervid in your gaze, And why this backward strain? The land is Greece. Herod. The land is Greeceâyour land, philosopher, Your race, all people's race, the land of gods. [Nicholas moves away sternly. These coasts! Nicholas (passing the king as he paces). We land by Strato's Tower, the earth Still Greek, idolater! [He passes down the deck and becomes involved in talk with a group of seamen. Herod. The earth still Greek! Then I will build on it, adorn it. Temples, There shall be Temples;âay, And the great stronghold, CÃ¦sar's fort. [He falls into deep musing. Mariamneâ Her Tower . . . O Mariamne! it is childish The love I bear her, inexpressible. Mariamne! In my palace she will greet me, At my palace door; or rather she will stand And wait for my approach still as a flower. Children should run to greet you; but a woman Should wait upon your coming as a flower. [Presently Nicholas returns. Nicholas. King, you must rouse yourself. Herod. Not from my dream. [At sight of Nicholas's face. Good Nicholasâ What is the peril? Brief! Nicholas. There is report Throughout JudÃ¦a, and, it seems, through Egypt, That you are dead. Those clustered foreigners, Taken aboard to speed our ship, confer, In the confusion of their dialects, Of how King Herod has been killed and all His lands in turbulence . . . [Herod suddenly shrieks and tears his hair. Nicholas. What ails the king? Sailors. What sickness? Herod (to the Sailors). Swift! Swift, if you love me . . . I have intimation, I have seen it as a spectre from the sea, The queen is dead! Swift! she is calling me . . . [He stares blankly to sea, while Nicholas encourages the Sailors. Sailors. King Herod, we will bring him to the haven! Scene IV Alexandrium: a room of the royal fortress Enter to Sohemus, Mariamne Mariamne. I would ride forth to-day. [Perceiving that Sohemus gives no heed. Prepare me A cohort of fair camels. Sohemus (bowing). I am your slave. Mariamne. Say rather You are my jailer, for you do not stir. Sohemus (bowing again). I am your slaveâdo with me what you will. [He goes on pacing; Mariamne stands by the window and sighs. Mariamne (with a gesture of entreaty to Sohemus as he passes). The air! Sohemus. I cannot, queen; my lord's commands! [He moves past her. Mariamne. Leave off your pacingâ Sohemus, let me pace. Cease! I am weary Of watching you so harsh against the walls; As I should watch a spider drop his web, And up again, for ever to and fro. [Meeting Sohemus's eyes as she rises and prepares to pace. Why am I here? Sohemus. Look in my shield. [Lifting it. Mariamne (closing her eyes). He never Can be so hated as I hate him. Sorrow It is that I have looked upon his face. Sohemus. And would you look upon his face no more? [She hesitates. Mariamne. O that his life were in my very hands! [Sohemus stands before her. Sohemus. Madam, there is report your lord is dead. Mariamne. Ayâbut a vague report spread through the lands, Carried by pilgrims, wrought into a tale, To cover up the people in such darkness, That their great king is dead. You are not weeping? Sohemus. It is report, and yet so vehement His mother at Masada mourns his death; His sister takes the news; and for the manner, Report says he was tortured and then killed. Mariamne. Has CÃ¦sar dared to kill him, and is Jewry Treated so abject? Oh, a Maccabee, And not to take revenge! Sohemus. But the sure message Delaysâa mere report, spread from the sea To murmuring CÃ¦sarea. Were it sure . . . [He is close on her, face to face. I have command to kill you . . . My reward,â If I shall spare your life? Enter Queen Alexandra Alexandra. Stay, Sohemus! Sohemus, spare my child! . . . [She pushes Mariamne at arm's length from Sohemus and stands between them looking back at him. My Jewish soldierâand the fierce command Laid on you is a Gentile's! Sohemus, I and this slender queen before you are The last of Judas Maccabeus left, He that delivered Jewry from the stranger. I loose you from strange bondage! The Lord God Looses His servant from abomination Of oath to Esau's offspring: the Lord God Blessed Jacob the Beguiler. Spare my child, My beauty of the Asmoneansâspare her! Mariamne. He will not kill us; Mother, there is no fear; we are as safe As the nesting cranes. Sohemus. But my reward for this? Alexandra. Oh, excellent! A prize! You save her life . . . Behold her beautiful. Oh, is she not A living tree of flower before our eyes, A living strength with living ornament Of lips and cheek and open gaze, and brow Of a flowered myrtle? Now she is my own; Now she is mine again I grasp her, almost To lift her as my son to sovereignty. See how she pines for freedomâshe is snuffing The air . . . her nostrils! She is born again To breath, to draw it as a right and feel it Ungrudged to her young bosom. (Clasping Mariamne.) Once again I give her to the air, my Mariamne. No more disquiet! Ah, true, loyal soldier, Though in her eyes there was no fear, there floated That in their sadness the wild creatures showâ A daydream of their end . . . I have often thought She would be happier to dieâmy child, Who coldly met each day as though her last: She of the blessing and the birthright, he Of the surrendered blessing, the lost birthright; She of great lineage, so slavish his; So miserable, of his cruelty, Her race, the kings Antigonus, Hyrcanus, And the lovely young High Priest, your prince, her brother. (To Mariamne.) Do not speak, Mariamne! Breathe on your gratitude, breathe peacefully. [Mariamne moves slowly away and looks out over the tombs. My daughter is no politician. Ever She loved the dead, and now will love her husband. Let her consume her comeliness with ashes While we devise for her a happy kingdom! Sohemus, hasten! Seize the courts and towers And gateways of Jerusalem. Make speed! Sohemus, in your life as in our lives, The moment of our fate has quickened: Fate Bears but few living children. Sohemus, Make speed! Sohemus. It is not you that can reward me: Your daughter . . . Madam, I must have her oath. Alexandra. Her oathâmy oath! I swear she shall be yours, Here in my palace. On King Herod's sword . . . [Mariamne comes down toward them and speaks as from a dream. Mariamne. First tortured, and then killed! Alexandra. Ay, child. Receive it! Tortured in Rome, the city of his triumph, Tortured among the people of his love, Tortured at CÃ¦sar's will, whom he has vaunted Worthy as God of Temple-worship, homage Of incense. Mariamne. But he does not suffer now. He is at peace. Alexandra. In bottomless Gehenna! (To Sohemus.) And you are very sure of this report? Sohemus. Madam, it is so current in men's ears, That if my lord return my life is forfeit, Save for your intervention, or his coming With a maimed power or sovereignty from Rome. Alexandra. My child is saved, and if she be a widow She will herself reward you. Sohemus, Think! I have lost my son . . . (To Mariamne.) No, do not touch meâ A fang is in your touchâyou cannot comfort; A man alone can comfort me, a man Who will avenge me for my son. (To Mariamne.) Be silent! You have neither mouth nor wisdom. Sohemus, If this report be insubstantial, if He be not dead, why then, he shall be dead: As the days make themselves, his doom be made. Meantime there must be great festivity, Pomps, dazzling courtesies, and Mariamne Even more desirable than kingdoms. [Mariamne makes a protesting motion. Child, And will you not dissemble, sacrifice Your virtue?âthe one victim we can spare, Bred to be sacrificed; a prince's virtue, Therefore to be esteemed. (With sudden passion.) Consider, child, All I have done . . . [A Gatekeeper rushes in. Gatekeeper. The king! . . . The king is at the fortress-doors. [He rushes out. Alexandra (crossing to Sohemus). Then we are doomedâ The faithful wife will now betray her mother, Betray you, the preserver of her breath. [Suddenly returning, she kneels to Mariamne. But, daughter, you have found it sweet to live; You have set your life before aught else: have mercy! Do not destroy your mother. Let me live! Sohemus (kissing an end of her robe). Queen Mariamne, My life is in your hands, you may take my life. Mariamne. Bring in the king straight to me as I am. Leave me, but take my mother to her women. [Exit Sohemus with Queen Alexandra. Enter Herod on the other side, his hair disordered and flying. Herod. Mariamne!âBut you are wellâ [He kneels, holding her hands in his own, sobbing. Then he rises and tries to recollect himself. You might have aged, you might have lost your beautyâ It harried meâyou might have lost your health. I have thought of all the chances . . . all the fears, The apprehensions that have startled me, Lacking you in my sight. My startled sleep Has been the watching of your ghosts. . . . Not one, Ghosts in succession, ghosts of Mariamne. I laugh now . . . laugh with me! Should we not laugh? . . . The rose upon your cheek, that rose profound In its abateless damask, not a flush, Not deepening for me, steady as the stain Dyed in a mummy's face-cloth . . . is it welcome? But you are safe, and every idol-god Shall have reward for this. . . . Look at me, love; I live, I am returned to you, I am well with CÃ¦sar. [She groans. Mariamne. What should that be to me? [She falls to the ground. Herod. Surely she would not dare to do this thing! She is playing with a harsh, A cruel instrument of war, an engine That will cut her all to pieces! We must warn her, We must instruct her. [He goes to her prostrate on the ground. Mariamne, Mariamne, you are ill-prepared! You do not yet receive me as you must. . . . Have pity on yourself, For if you do not plead with me, my Dead . . . Have pity! . . . Are you grown so ignorant, And all I am forgot? . . . I am well with CÃ¦sar; But if you have been gloating on my death, Let me whisper in your earâit is a counsel, A friendly counselâyou must make pretence; You must get up from off your knees, and grieve That you are not attired in majesty, Giving me to excuse the wrong, such richness And fragrance of you in your lips and eyes, Such flash of jewels loitering into bloom As I behold you . . . and the voice Of the fountain as it leaps in all your speech, Of the fountain breaking from the rocks . . . Dissemble! . . . You have a cause against me, a complaint? Behold me, I am in the judgment-seat. I will hear your wrongs. [He seats himself. Mariamne. Not thatâit is not that. . . . I would warn you; there I would not fail in duty: My motherâ My motherâshe would hurt. . . . She shall not hurt you; Remove her from me. I would have no harm To happen to you. She would do you hurt! [She kneels, and rubs her head against Herod's garments. Herod. You love me? Say you love me with that cry. Mariamne. Pull down your hair. . . . Fie, it is braided false! Who taught you this in Rome? What crinkled hair! [She rebraids a tress. Herod. Cleopatra would have taught me this. [Mariamne smiles. Mariamne. My Arab Is fairer than her Roman. How the sea Is in your hair! And you were nearly wrecked? . . . Remember, I have warned you there are many Waiting about your throne to do you harm, My mother chief. . . . Now speak to me of Rome. Herod (taking her on his knee). But, Mariamne, I have brought you giftsâ A Tyrian robe. . . . There was a Cosian thing, a robe, a veil Augustus chose. . . . [Setting her free again, he goes impetuously to the door and gives a command. Mariamne (as he returns). And did you choose it too, This Cosian robe? Herod. The tissue was by far The more esteemedâtoo fine to catch the eye. I hesitated long, and then . . . [An ample and heavy stole of Tyrian is brought in. O Mariamne, will you wear this robe? Mariamne. There, let it be! Now tell me of Augustus, For I would hear of every circumstance About your life to guard you. Herod. Rome! Is it your fashion to inquire of Rome While I am feeling for your breath, so close I listen, and so fine? Enfold meâno, Leave me! . . . I am ashamed. [He sits down, buries his face in his hands, and groans; Mariamne walks out, leaving the straight robe before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V Scene I Later. Herod's bedchamber. Nicholas has been reading to him Herod. Tie up your scroll. . . . The nettling dog-star reigns. I am hot; I am distraught. . . . The cactus-flowers And roses! All one's life would fain lie out Open as theirs. . . . [Exit Nicholas. Now tell me, Sohemus, Did the queen speak of me? Sohemus. She is always silent. Herod. Of meâand was she silent of all else? Sohemus. Save of her captive breath. She longed for motion And air in her captivity. Herod. And never She looked upon my portrait? Sohemus. Once. Bent forward from the waist, her neck outstretched, Her hands bound back, she gazed on you; I passed And I repassed the door; she did not move. Herod. Send me Bagoas. Wake him if he sleep. Sohemus. My lord . . . Herod. What, you demur? Send me Bagoas. [Exit Sohemus. Now in a ball of light she would approach me, And in the levelness of light be mine. She must come, nor dissemble with me more.

Tell her, further, To wake her will at need, he is the king, And by twofold obedience she must come. But, fellow, do not look distractedly. Wake her with dove-wing touches; do not scatter The bountiful moments of her sleep. No harshness! Nothing but thisâthat she must come to me. Bagoas. My lord!â Herod. Go, do your office. [Exit Bagoas. If she should disobey, the noon were not, And the eternal opposite of noon Fixed as a destiny. . . . But she lies wide, Musk-strewnâasleep. The great mansuetude! Sleep is so warm, So affable. . . . Do the dark bow-strings curve, Strained at my summons wide to let fly passion That the smooth hour is ended? Does she waken Her lids, her flashing eyes? But she will come! I wait to very pain; a gold confusion Of many sunbeams takes away the sun. Silenceâbut out of it some fuller spirit Is ready. . . . Silenceâno! Along the marble A shuffling on of slippers. . . . Not Bagoas! [Rising from his couch. Mariamneâblessed! Thou art come. [She stands at the door in girded dress and veil. Mariamne. You sent at noon for me and broke repose. Is it ill news, or worseâthat you are ill? Herod. I wanted youâ Mariamne. My lord, you have awaked me. What was your cause? Herod. Bagoas waked you gently? I wanted youâ One of your cheeks is blowing Sleep's own red rose. Come to my couch, beloved. Mariamne. I will not. Herod. Ha!âdefy me? The sun could scorch up any life outside . . . And you are witless with your slumber still. Are you not mine? Am I not burning here Awake? I was awake while you have slept. . . . I could not bear it longerâvery pain! Have mercy on me, solace! Yea, have mercy! Earth and the secret hour are but one flameâ We are enwrapt. . . . Heed me, I sayâgive heed! Mariamne. How dared you send for me, your royal queen, And from among my womenâas a slave! Herod. If you are queen, of me The title names you, being my wife. Remember, Womanâthere is the breaking-up of ties, There are writings of divorce, and there are deaths For treason to be sufferedâviolence, thunders And lightnings that enthrall you in their actions To the quick of their own ravageâ Mariamne. But I fear None of these ills, nor you. Herod (grasping her veil). Am I your husband? Am I your king? Mariamne. Loose me! Not now!âA slave, Bred of the servant Esau. Let me loose! [She yields her veil to his hand and moves away swiftly. He stands as if stunned; then beats his head against the column of the door. Herod. Her veil! [A young Eunuch enters. Send in my cupbearer with well-cooled wine. [Exit the Eunuch. [Herod drops on his couch. Oh, the void nothing, oh, the dust of fleshâ Arrows upon the ground! Enter his Cupbearer My boy, a draught. Why do you fumble? Taste the wine. Cupbearer. I drink it. I dare to drink what I have mixed myself. But, king, I have a potion that the queen Gave me, and called in the Aramaic tongue A love-charm: 'tis for you. Herod. For me, a love-charm! No, reptileâno! Cupbearer. A potion that she called A love-charm in the Aramaic tongue. Herod. The wife-adult'ress, who would be a widow, Calls her snake-venoms in Egyptian phials Love-charms! . . . You dare not drink, conceiving aspic Is in the nectar? Bid my Gaulish guard Seize old Bagoas: we will hear as strictly As rack can tell of this attempt. Bagoas Must be delivered to the torturer For our swift satisfaction. Every door Of the women's quarters bid the soldiers seize, Treading with secrecy, their weapons loosened, Before the march, from sheath. Bid Sohemus Attend meâand the Princess Salome and the Tetrarch Pheroras. [Exit Cupbearer. Will not this strike my chains apart? (Suddenly breaking into sobs.) Forsaken, Betrayed, condemned . . . Terrible wilderness! [He weeps long. Re-enter Sohemus Sohemus. My lordâ Herod. You have heard? Sohemus. The queenâthe queen is true. She is not one to deal with sorcery: She is plain in action, and when still is safe. Herod. You guarded her, while I was far away, And all her hours were frankâyou hold her true? Enter Salome and Pheroras Salome. O brother! . . . Herod (putting his hand in hers). Hush, Salome! Sohemus Is praising my fair culprit. Pheroras. Sohemus! Brother, but Sohemus himself is charged In this attempt. Sohemus. No! Pheroras. On Bagoas' oath. Bagoas, stretched to spider on the wheel, Knows nothing of the venom. But of the queen's ill-willâhas noted it Due to some confidence this Sohemus Dropped in her ear, before you came from Rome. Sohemus. The creature is in agony and weaving A lie for relaxation of his pain. What should I tell the queen? A messenger came to the fortress rarely As song-bird to the desert. What invent? I heard no tidings, nor could weave her tales. Bagoas prowled about his royal lady If but my step was heard, if but its echo From distant rooms. Herod (crying out). Her paramour! Sohemus. My kingâ Herod. Call in the palace guard! . . . Sohemus. But if through pityâ The Guard enter Herod. Take this dishonoured officer to death. What is it that astounds you? By confession, Wrung from Bagoas on the rack, he loosed A secret of my will to Mariamne The queen. Sohemus. The queen is guiltless. Herod. Out! Begone! Begone! Sohemus. But hear meâ Herod. Take him out! [Exit Guard with Sohemus. Gross transformations! I have been struck As thunder-struck, nor know what I have said. Yet I remember She rose to call me slave, and struck far back. Slave! There is left One vast perfecting: she shall surely die. Salome. Swift as her paramour. Herod. No. I am husband Of Mariamne to condemn the traitor Who won my rights as favours of her love. . . . She is queen of Jewry, and must take her trial. Salome, do you think I turn to mercy In showing her to allâthis murderess, this Converser with familiars, twice a whore, To Joseph, then to Sohemus! . . . The judge Who sat against the city-gate is in me, As I were sitting thereâmen coming through, And going forth, and cries, and camel-loads Of burthens, and the country with big lights And clouds from over itâand I the judge. Brother, you know my friends Within the Sanhedrin: convoke their numbers, Convoke the council for to-morrow. . . . Send A eunuch to prepare the bath . . . So hot! Salome, go, sit down beside my mother, And keep her from me. . . . All about the doors Of the women's quarters there are sentries standing With naked swords. . . . The hive stopped up! Salome, Go, little sister! [Exit Salome. I shall lie an hour Or longer in the bath; and meet to-night The friendly Rabbis of the Sanhedrin; Set on the scribes With the accusation. We must leave excuse For no regret. There are wide doors that others Must open, not ourselves. There are wide doors, Too heavy; and beyond them. . . . Do you see, It must be ruled to-night among us, judged In court to-morrow? [Exit Pheroras. Is there night and day? Black . . . white . . . I have untressed my hair! Am I not now untressing it? No action! She must be judged indifferent . . . A Eunuch (opening a curtain and bowing). The bath! Scene II Jerusalem. The evening of the next day. An apartment facing west, in the king's house. It gives on the columns of a vestibule. Cypros and Salome Cypros. Do you hear himâhear my son; his ceaseless treading As the creatures tread at night? Salome. I hear him, mother; He is stepping out her doom. Cypros. You hear his treading, Soft on the carpet, struck against the marble? Would she were dead, who hated him to death! Why does he place a guard, as round a city, Deep round the women's chambers of the palace, As strong a guard as he besieged a city? Salome. Had he but looked on her, Those mournful, sable eyes and lids in shadow Under the pearl-laced crown, that brow in shadow, And the obdurate mouth had been a charm To honour as to fortitude. But, mother, She strives to send no message; she is silent As trophies or cold statues. Cypros. Listen, listen! Is he not treading nearer? But I fear it, As when the heel of thunder clangs at hand. . . . I will run the other way. To-morrow! [Exit. Salome. Ayâ To-morrow for the mother and the son. . . . Our time is now, Herod's and mine! (Looking out.) Day fills its arc; and there is quietness From heat and sunlightâthere are shadows. Enter Herod Herod, My brother . . . Herod. Do not stop me with your words. Salome. Stay but a little . . . (She catches his hand.) See, How cooler and more dark it is! Herod. More dark! Salome. A daylight blue without the sunâand quiet About the buildings. . . . You are with me now. Herod. . . . Salome, out beyond The Dead Sea there is country where the lions, The terrible wild beasts upon the tracks, Sicken of fever every other day, Sicken, or else they would destroy the world. . . . Sicken of fever in the tracks . . . The hunters told me when I was a boy. [He throws himself down on some cushions. Salome, have you met And passed a lion on his path? They told me A man should never turn his eyes To watch the lion, for that would waken anger, Though he were sick. . . . You did not set your eyes On mine. . . . Salome, every one has hurried Before me after gazing; but no faintness Of heart is in you, and no rage in me, Only this freezing fever. [He begins to shiver. Salome. Take my stole. [She goes to the door and calls. Bring wine, with grain of pepper-corns. [She comes back to him; an attendant brings a cordial and goes out. Drink, drink! Herod (after drinking). Salome . . . O God of Israel, God of my Temple, The stories of my childhood! In a heathen, Untrammelled fever of my soul, Salome, I even could pray Thul Kholsa, the old idol of our fathers, Patron of safety in affairs of peace, Patron of safety in affairs of bloodshed; And cast a sheaf of arrows at his feet For consultation, watching, for my omen, The figures made upon the ground, as fall The arrows. . . . I, so deft in archeryâ I would be safe, I would be safeâ Cast arrows To know myself secure. . . . Salome. Hush! Are you mad Indeed? Why? [He rises and moves toward the sunset, so that he has his back to Salome. Herod. I have thoughts Of respite and reprieve. . . . Salome. Herod! Herod. Of respite And of reprieveânot from a tomb, but death; Not from her burial, from immolation, Banishment to the void and from the air! Not so escape! But there are fortressesâ Masada by the Dead Sea coast; There I could bury her as in a coffin, Each sigh of wind a death-song over her. Were not that best? A tower her monument, Yet she not dead, not out of all account, Still mortal, still not absolutely lost; Coffered, not coffinedânot inanimate, Held in the jaws of her sarcophagus, Unseen of living nature, but alive . . . With the cloud eyes of her, the silken cheek, Even the voice of rough-edged undertone, Enamouring offence. There none would love her, None! But my treasury Would have sealed riches, not a destitute, Defaulting cave. Among the coins and jewels, Locked-up regalia and spoilâa queen. . . . The difference! . . . There in the rusty gloom accessible. The difference! I think she shall not die. I think of fortressesâ Masada by the Dead Sea coast. I ponder not to kill her, but immure. Salome. Surfeit your hatred Upon my love! Brother, the feast be full! But listen, while you feed upon your hatred, And I will play, in love, Love's instruments Against your ear. Listen! This Jewessâlisten! Does she not make you opposite in nature To your own self? You have won honour, Herod; Your people called you Great! Imperial Rome Has found your brow incapable except Of one adornment that was given, a crown. Will you, who won Arabian wars and settled Your crown on you by siege and battlefield, Be made so tender by a cruel wanton, That when her spite would murder you your blood Claims not her blood's atonement? You that hold The Romans as true governors of earth, The judgesâthe firm lips and brains!âyou summon A Council, you demand a sentence passed, Your will her condemnation; and you shiver With feverous weakness and unsay the sentence The law pronounced and the king ratified! Oh, is this man worthy a Roman ensign, Worthy an eagle in the air above him, Worthy the friendship of the lords of earth? [A Eunuch stands at the door. Eunuch. Rabbi Shemaiah prays to see the king. Salome. Will you receive him? Send him backâhe is An enemy within the Sanhedrin. Herod. I will receive him. Salome. Herod, you are ragged And lank, not in your majesty. Herod. The king Will hear Rabbi Shemaiah. [Exit Eunuch. [Herod and Salome keep silent: she kneels down on her cushion and looks at the sundown till Shemaiah enters, when she turns and watches her brother. Shemaiah. O lord king, Grant your forgiveness that I speak the words Of many at your feet; temper your wisdom With mercy; press not with intemperance Of haste against the Asmonean lady, Your queen condemnedâbut while the proofs are dark Against her shining as your wife, remove her To solitude of prison, and awhile Hold back from her the final penalty On which no light can shine. My voice is many A voice in prayer. Herod. We turn not from our sentence. Shemaiah. Turn not, but linger Awhile the days before it be fulfilled. Herod. My wrath is on you, Rabbi, and on those Who would turn back from their own judgment: never Will I, the judge, turn so. Remorselessly Our God effects for justice, and remorseless Before men's fear should be that governor Who holds him to his rulershipâhis sentence Shall be of doom, shall stand, shall domineer. Shemaiah. The Jews have loved her. Herod. Have they? Shemaiah. Their deliverance By Judas and his brethren, as rich spice In wine, has glorified her stately blood; They would not see it shed save for such guilt As many days have looked upon with strictness Of light and argument. Herod. My wrath is on you. Old man, I am the judge, I am the kingâ There will not be a queen: I am her husband. The voices you would have me listen to Are low down, far behind, far offâthe croaking Of frogs at night-time . . . There is night for me, And dawn to come and sliding day. . . . Go back, Far off!âBid those that sit and croak with you Remember how august the Sanhedrin Would rule the sons of Jacob. Say the king Will turn not from his sentence for an hour. Shemaiah. God save you! [Exit. Salome. Herodâ Herod. I shall stay here, Salome; not with you, But not alone. . . . There is no track for sleep To wander after me; I shall not sleep, Not at the hour when night is dead asleep. Send Nicholas to read his History, To read it on and on, and by my hearing Tangle my fancy that I may not image The heaved sword and the eyes' Last kindness to the lightâ The hollow in them at the severance Of the adored head from its bodily form And appertaining stature . . . [He begins to wander backward and forward. If I listen To Nicholas it will be as a seaâ What men have done and sufferedâas a sea Pouring upon my ears; and it will tangle Imagination that it shall not raise me My bridal chamber at Samaria, The adored head on my bosom, the young body Loving me close, in very oneness, flesh Even of my fleshâour bridal a flower's heart Of balsam, and our secrecy . . . To-morrow The people watch her to her death. Salome, Call Nicholas . . . I shall stay here, for dawn Comes on the other side: the sun Comes on the other side. Send Nicholas! Scene III The balcony of Queen Alexandra's house, overlooking the courtyard of the royal palace, filled with people. Alexandra. I am waiting to see her pass: it is a spectacle. She has grown very beautiful in her silence. She will not look on me; she refuses to say farewell. [Turning back at the sound within of angry babble. No, children, no! They must not lookâ I will not lift you up. No! A Voice. What is it? Alexandra. It is nothing: it is some one who must die. The Voice. Then lift me up. Alexandra. It may be she will turn if she hears the child. My beautiful one! I must see her! [She brings out Alexander in her arms. Alexander. Where is it? The people stand together with close feet. Where is it? There is no music. Alexandra. Peace! But when she comes, call for her; speak her name. [Enter, at a distance, Mariamne; behind her, her waiting-maid, Judith; then her executioners and a guard. A low groan with weeping is heard from the crowd. Alexander (struggling free). I will not see it! Aristobulus, it is our mother. . . . I will go to her! [He runs within; there are sounds of struggle and of sobs. Alexandra. A victim! I have borne but victims, I Of the Deliverer's bone and blood. A victim! The Jewish royal glory Before me criminal, abased. My people, You are weeping, Israel, you are weeping her! Should you not weep? I am a rootless stem, I have no son: I gave this child a bridegroom, who exalted And raised her up a queen. And she refused This saviour of our race, Enraged his love with insolence and harshness, Nor feared him, nor obeyed him, nor with wisdom Guided herself, nor counsel. Oh, behold her, Your crown laid in the dust, my shame, my sorrow . . . Mariamne! [Mariamne, who is now below the window, pauses, but does not look. I am aged, I have few years; you have made them grey to me, Grey years . . . My people, she has closed her heart. She that betrayed her race, her doting husband, Her tender children, she has closed her heart. Where is the Rose Of Sharon, where the Lily of the Valleys? My people, I have seen my kindred perish, I have no son, . . . and she has closed her heart. [Mariamne neither looks nor moves. Suddenly Alexandra leans over the balcony, till her head is in line with her knees. Judith!âMy service now! Mariamne. I shall want her by for my disrobing. . . . No, Pass to your mistress. [Judith hesitates, but Mariamne's hand forces her to leave the procession. Some one in the crowd throws Mariamne a rose; it falls at her feet, and Judith picks it up, giving it to her mistress, while they say good-bye with their eyes. Mariamne walks on, wrapping her hands round the flower. Judith goes into Alexandra's house, and in a little while comes on to the balcony. Alexandra. You have touched her robe; oh, you have touched her hairâ My child! You could not have disrobed her, child. Nay, do not weep! [She holds Judith against her breast for a moment, then looses her. Go, bring me back the raiment of my child, And the tresses of her blood. . . . Scene IV Samaria: the king's house. A large apartment; at the back closed curtains that separate it from an ante-room. The body of Mariamne has been embalmed and laid in a high-erected sarcophagus with a crystal lid. Alexander and Aristobulus, her young children, creep up to it, toys in their hands. Alexander. O Aristobulus, one day I shall be a man; then we shall be great soldiers. . . . Let us playâlet us play at taking Jerusalem. [They sit on the floor beyond the sarcophagus and begin a game. Cypros, with lynx-like movement, steals down, where, unseen, she can observe them. Aristobulus. Here are not bricks enough. Alexander (taking his hand). I will get you bricks out where the sand wren is singing. (Seeing Cypros.) Why are you here? Why do you watch us? Cypros (grinning through her wrinkles). I am the enemy that will destroy your city. Have a care! Aristobulus. Women cannot destroy cities. Move back! Nicholas comes to the door with a deep obeisance. Nicholas. Lady Cypros, may I enter? [She gives sign of assent. I find the palace an unguarded tomb; all the doors are wide, and all the ministrants dispersed âthe king absent. Cyros. I am guardian of the princes, I their grandmother: I am guardian of the tomb. [She laughs. Nicholas. The kingâ Cypros (suddenly clasping the knees of Nicholas). If you could break the seal upon his heart! He hunts the wilderness, and very far Our young men tracked his wandering yesterday: They heard a cry as lonely As the rock-partridges in rocky close! Sometimes at dead of night he brings a torch To look at her, and laughs long in the flame; And then the torch is lost, and I hear groaning As never I have heard it since my travail. I fear my son will die. You are without, You move in the open earthâwhere is my son? [Nicholas trembles and looks fearfully at the sarcophagus. Nicholas. This is the secretâand his centre here; And this the pestilence he would escape, And carries to the desert. [He goes up to the sarcophagus. Wonderful! A mystery of Venus laid aside To rest in the gold watches of the sea, And like a trophy, or a spoil of war. Cypros (behind, plucking his sleeve). Is she an evil spirit craving blood? [A voice is heard in the tone of command, and silence falls on the whispering of women's voices behind the curtain. Herod lifts it and runs up rapidly to the sarcophagus. Cypros shrinks back. Herod. See, Nicholas! I scan her eyelids . . . folly is not there, Nor folly as a sackcloth on her face. [Scanning Mariamne. It is most curious, she grows And changes like a sunrise in its clouds; She is not fading from me. And sometimes She smiles; and there are moments she forgives me, And moments of revenge. Suddenly Herod descends the steps of the sarcophagus, and motions to Nicholas to sit. Well, friend! Well, Nicholas? Tell me what tidings from Jerusalem. 'Tis long since we have met. [Perceiving Cypros seated on the steps that lead up to the curtained ante-room. How patient, mother, You sit, how patient! [He goes to her and lays his head on her knees. There! I have been hunting, And I am hungry. Cypros. Son, you are a-hungered? You will do well, will live, though thin and wasted. Herod. Fetch me the meat I loveâgo, cook it for me . . . The fresh meat from the hunt. [Exit Cypros. I am hungry past my wont. In all my hunting I have killed nothing: it is all a void Out on the shrieking fields and dunes . . . I asked My mother for fresh food . . . but I have planned A greater festival. To-night I banquet. Music! [He turns sharply toward the sarcophagus. No, no! I have not touched her harp. No music!âI have passed into her garden, And cut the roses one by one, a harvest For the great banquet and the many wreaths. It must be all accomplished of a sudden, For I must end this solitude. Full wickers Of roses have been carried to the womenâ They are weaving them within. (Smiling.) Philosopher, And you will start a theme: Was Alexander greater of his day Than CÃ¦sar was of his? Some swelling theme To strike a noise from all. But do not leave me! [He moves round and perceives his sons. Well, childrenâat your play? [They rise and leave their toys on the ground. Come back! Why were you playing in this room? [The children shrink before him. Herod convulsively clutches them and holds them down on each side. Who was it gave you leave?âWhat scares you? You love her? Listen, you shall always love her. She is as a goddessâbut we must not be afraid of her; she is not close by you on the earth as I am close. Children, I love you in your play. I would not break it. This city . . . you besiege it? (One of the boys nods; with trembling hands Herod picks up some of the toys.) I will play with you. You must talk and teach me how to play. (The children remain stubborn.) What would you like to do? Would you like me to tell you a story? (They shake their heads.) Not a story? Not how I killed Hezekiah, the robber-captain, when a lad as young as David? (They still shake their heads.) Not that;âbut the vengeance I took for my father Antipater, your grandfather; blood for his blood . . . or the Arabian War, the captives taken in their thousands? You shall become great as I am great: I can teach you. Will you listen? When I was in Rome . . . Alexander. Father, we would go to Rome . . . Send us away to Rome! [They spring back frightened at themselves. Herod. To Rome? [He remains staring at the thought. The younger boy turns back and kisses his hand. Aristobulus. May we go, father? May we go? We shall come back again. Herod. Go, go for ever! [They run away terrified. They shall go, they shall goâshall be made kings. How natural it is! . . . And I am left alone. How natural One's children should go forth from one to Rome . . . And all the voices die! I cannot be alone, for she is there. And yet I should not dare to waken her, Not from her sleep. And yet . . . Call on her, call, Call on her by her name! I dare not call. She must not think I call, but she must be Persuaded back to me. Go, bid her women Call her as when she was their mistress. Set them To stand behind the columns of the house, And call her home. Nicholas (controlling his terror). I will instruct the women. Herod. Fetch them to hear their charge. [Nicholas opens the curtains: the women are weaving wreaths of roses for the guests of the evening. A nurse and the children are with them. Nicholas. The king commands you To the king's presence. [They drop the roses, some at once, some as they come forward. Herod. Women of my house, The house is silent: there is but one name To break for me the solitude. Disperse you Among the columns; call your mistress back, Call her to me, call one by one! If this is but a frenzy to your thoughts, Do not pursue your thoughts; stay them with me. Call her as on the mountains God was called By Jephthah's daughter and her troop of maidens, The servants of her house. You have soft voices; I heard them creep about the silence. Rouse them Forth, as the desert lark's, to fetch your lady Home to her house and husband. Lift your rosesâ The fresh blooms in your hands, disperse, and call her name. [The women disperse. Others must call! . . . I am to her a stranger of the tents . . . Woe to the tents lost in the stony plains! [Suddenly women's voices severally and in unison call many times, near and far away. Voices. Mariamne! Mariamne! Mariamne! [The children run to their nurse in terror, and she covers their heads with her veil. Herod bends his face down on the lid of the sarcophagus. The voices call on: through them his loud whisper is heard to the corpse. Herod. Mariamne!</field>
