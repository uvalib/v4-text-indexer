      <field name="fulltext">TO THE NO LESSE HONOURED then Deserving, Sir Walter Tichborne Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE AVTHOR IN THAT Transcribing his Book, without his knowledge I was bound by promise to stand to his pleasure to keepe it or burne it. I will not praise this Worke, 'twere labor lost, Rich Pearles best praise themselves, nor will I boast To be possest of more than Indians wealth, That were the way to loose't since I my selfe Distrust my selfe in keeping it, and stand In feare of robbing by some envious hand: Rob'd of it said I? Alas that fate were just, Since I am found first theefe to you, who durst Vnbidden thus, Ransacke your pretious store; This magazine of wit, so choyce; nay more, Steale from the chariot of the glorious Sunne, This heavenly fire, what shall I say 'tis done; I doe confesse the inditement, pitty then Must be my surest Advocate 'mongst men. None can abate the rigor of the Law, But the Law-giver; but methoughts I saw, (Or hop'd I saw) some watry beames of Mercy, Breake glimpsing forth of your imperious eye. O let me beg reprive, your pardon may By due observance come another day. Here low I tender'd backe to bid the doome, By promise bound to him, to him with whom; I would not breake for all rich Tagus sands, Now he the Prisoner at your mercy stands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? Ergo ibit in ignes Hoc opus, æternum ruet &amp; tot bella, tot Enses; In Cineres dabit hor a nocens: ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. VVere not out present subject mixt with feare, 'Twould much affright us to see all you heere. One would suffice us, or no Auditor. Each to himselfe an ample Theater, Let rude Plebejans thinke so, but we know All judgments here from the same Spring doe flow. All here have but one censure, all one brest. All sonnes of the same Mother; but the rest We preoccupate their Censure, and fore-tell, What after may be said not to be well, As in most decent Garments you may see, Some gracious Ornaments inweaved bee: Which serve for little use, but on some day Destin'd to please himselfe, the wearer may Without a blush put on, when his best friends Intend to visit him, so our hope intends The sacred Muses Progeny to greet, Which under our Roofe, now the third time meet, We will not ope the booke to you, and show A story word by word, as it doth goe, But give invention leave to undertake, Of it's owne straines, some benefit to make: For though a Tragicke Pen may be confin'd, Within a studies private Walles, the mind Must be unbounded, and with inventions steele, Strike fire from alient Flints— So free we are from setting any price, On these our studied Vanities, that advice Almost disdain'd the whispers of those tongues Which private first, though vented publike wrongs To the Patient Patient oft. We'll here begin To be a litle peremptory, oh that sinne Of wilfull indiscretion, 'tis no bayes To make us Garlands of our owne mouthes praise, Which who affect, may they so Lawrell lacke, That slanders Thunder may behind their backe, Blast them with Calumny, for we vow they deare Pay for their paines, that give attention here. And since it's suffered with kind indulgence We hope that Kingly Parent's our defence, Who would not have his dandling love be knowne, But unto those had off spring of their owne, And for we are assured that here be No braines so curst with blacke sterilitie. But of some nature they can freely call, Births more mature, and Cælestiall, Their studies issue, they like kindest Mothers, With tender hands will swath the limbes of others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGVMENT. A suppos'd Victory by Amvrath Obtain'd in Greece, where many captives tane, One among the rest, Irene, conquers him; For taken with her love, he sounds retreat. Eternally from Warre: but after, mov'd With murmur of his Nobles, in her Bed Before his Councels face, strikes off her head. Then ruinating former bloudy broyles, He straight ore'comes all Christian Provinces, Invades the Confines of his Sonne in Law, Fires Caramania, and makes Aladin With's Wife and Children suppliant for their lives; At length appointed his greatest Field to fight, Vpon Cassanae's Plaines, where having got A wondrous Conquest 'gainst the Christians, Comes the next morne to overview the dead, 'Mongst whom a Christian Captaine Cobelitz, Lying wounded there, at sight of Amurath, Rising and staggering towards him, desperately With a short dagger wounds him to the heart, And then immediately the Christian dyes. The Turke expiring, Bajazet his Heyre Strangles his younger brother: Thus still springs The Tragick sport which Fortune makes with Kings.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus, I. Scæna, I. Enter as from Warre Lala-Schahin at one doore, with warlike Musicke, Souldiers, a March. Enter to him at the other doore, Amurath in State, with Eumorphe his Concubine, attendants L. and Ladies. Amurath. Be dumb those now harsh notes, our softer eares Shall never be acquainted with such sounds, Peace (our grand) Captain, see here Amurath, That would have once confronted Mars himselfe, (Acknowledged for a better Deity) Puts off ambitious burdens, and doth hate Through bloudy Rivers to make passages, Whereby his Soule might flote to Acheron, Wrinckle your browes no more (sterne fates) for we Scorne to be made the servile Ministers To cut those threads, at which your selves have trembled, Esteeming us the fiercer Destiny. Yet must great Amurath thanke those sacred powers, They have enricht our soules with such a price, As had those Heroes whose revengefull Armes, Serv'd Mars a ten yeares Prentiship at Troy, Ere dream'd succeeding times should be possest, With such an unparalel'd unprized beauty as my Saint: They would not have prevented so their blisse, But beene most humble Sutors to the Gods, To have protracted their then fond spent life, But to behold this object. Which out-shines Their Helena, as much as doth the eye Of all the World, dazle the lesser fires. Iove Ile outbrave thee! melt thy selfe in Lust Embrace at once all starre-made Concubines, Ile not envie thee, know I have to spare Beauty enough, to make another Uenus; And for fond Gods, that have no reward in store To make me happier, here Ile place my Heaven. And for thy sake, this shall my Motto be, I conquered Greece, one Grecian conquered me. Eum. But (gracious Lord) those streames (we see) soone ebbe, Which with outragious swelling flow to fast, Forbid (Lucina) this soone kindled fire, Should ere burne out it selfe 'tis a true Theame, That nere lasts long, that seemeth most extreame. Amur. Can this rich price of nature, precious jem Give entertainment to suspecting guests? Come, come, these armes are curious chaines of love, With which thou link'st my heart æternally, Thy cheeks the royall Paper interlined, With Natures Rhetorique, and love perswasion, Stands there attracting still my gazing eye: This then Ile read, and here I now will faine, That these all Antique fables of the Gods, Are writ in flowing numbers; first thy lip, Was faire Europaes which they say made Iove, Turne a wild Heyfer: next, this sparkling eye Was the Æmonian Io's; then, this hand Lædaes, faire Mother to those Stare made Twins, Thus, thus, Ile Comment on this golden Booke: Nature nor Art, have taught how to faine: Fairest, 'twas you first brought me to this vaine: In loving Combats now I valiant prove, Let others warre, great Amurath shall love. Scha. Brave resolution, O the fond thoughts of man, Awake Evmo! Ile find stratagems: There shall be Physick, to purge this disease, Light sores are gently us'd, but such a part, Must be cut off, least it infect the hart. Amar. Schahin, Our Tutor, we command this night Be solemniz'd with all delightfull sports, Thy learn'd invention best can thinke upon. Prepare a Maske, which lively represents, How once the Gods did love: that shall not teach Vs by examples, but we'll smile to thinke: How poore and weake their idle faining was To our affection. Scahin, be free in wit, And suddaine: now come my Kingdomes Pride: Hymen would wed himselfe to such a Bride. Exeunt all but Scah. Scæna, 2. Scah. Nature, and all those universed powers, Which shew'd such Admirable Godlike skill, Inframing this true modell of our selves, This Man, this thing cal'd man, why doe you thus, Make him a spectacle of such laughter for you, When in each man we see a Monarchy? For, as in states, all fortunes still attend: So with a Kingdome, with a compleat state Well govern'd, and well manag'd in himselfe, Both each man beares, when that best part of man, (Reason) doth sway and rule each Passion. Affections are good Servants: but if will Make them once Master, theyle prove Tyrants still. No more King now: poore Subject Amvrath, Whom I have seene breake through a Troope of Men, Like lightning from a Cloud: and done those Acts, Which 'ene the Furies would have trembled at: Treading downe Armies, as if by them he meant Of dead mens backes to build up staires to Heaven: And now lyeth lurking in a womans armes Drencht in the Lethe of Ignoble lust, Appoints me for the wanton Enginere To keepe his so loose thoughts in smoothing tune. Woman enticing woman: golden hooke To catch our thoughts: and when we once are caught To drag's into the publike view of shame: And there we lye bathed in incestuous pleasure For all good men to laugh and scorne at once. Bode to my senses! I could eyther wish Our birth were like those Creatures, which we say Are bred from Putrid and corrupted matter; Then that we should acknowledge our deare being With grasse and flowers: for what else is our state? Vp to the top but then the waight shall fall Vpon their head that caus'd it. Worke (my braine) Tush, bloud, not water must wash off this staine. Exit. Scæna, 3. Enter Amurath in state with Nobles : Eumorphe with attendant Ladies: while Amurath ascends his Throne, and placeth Eumorphe by him. Am. Shine here (my beauty) and expell the night More than a thousand starres that grace the Heavens: Me thinkes, I see the Gods inventing shapes In which they meane to court thee. Iove he frownes And is farre more jealous, more suspitious Of thee, then all the painted Truls, whose eyes Bedecke the all ennameld Firmament. Eum. Beauty (my Lord) 'tis the worst part of woman, A weake poore thing, assaulted every houre By creeping minutes of defacing time: A superficies which each breath of care. Blasts off: and every humerous streame of griefe, Which flowes from forth these Fountaines of our eyes, Washeth away, as raine doth Winters snow. But those blest guiders of all Nuptiall rites, Have wrought a better sement to make fast, The hearts of Lovers; the true name of Wife Guilds o're our thrones, with a more constant shape, Than can be subject or to time, or care: And in our selves; yea in our owne true breasts, We have obedience, duty, carefull Love; And last and best of all, we may have Children, Children are Hymens pledges, these shall be Perpetuall chaines, to linke my Lord and me. Amur. Art thou a Woman? Goddesse, we adore, And Idolize; what we but loved before; What Divels have men beene, whose furious braines Have oft abus'd that Deity cald Woman: Dipping thir Ravens quill in Stygian Inke, To blast such heavenly paper as your faces. Were all the enticing lusts, damn'd policies, Prodigious fascinations, unsearcht thoughts, Dissembled teares, broke vowes, loath'd appetites, Luxurious and unsatiate desires. Were all these of Women equally weighed, That vertue in thy brest, 'twill out-ballance all And recompence the ruine of all thy Sexe. Enter a Servant and speakes. Serv. So please your Majesty, L. Schahins ready For entrance with his Masque. Am. Tell him we're wholly bent for expectation. Exit Serv. Sit, sit (my Queene) Musicke exceed your Spheares, Thinke I am Iove, and Godlike please our eares. Scæna, 4. A Masque. Enter from aloft two Torchbearers, then Iupiter and Iuno, and two Torchbearers more, then Mars and Uenus, and two Torchbearers more, then Apollo and Pallas, and two more Torchbearers, then Neptune and Diana. Whilst they are discending, Cupid hanging in the Ayre, sings to soft Musicke this Song following. Cupid sings. Gaze you mortals, gaze you still, On the Gods now looke your fill. Iove and Iuno are discending, Yes her Iealousie's not ending, Mars, sterne Mars, he will not fight, But with Venus when 'tis Night. Daphne crownes Apolloes head, Whom she would embrace in Bed, Neptune swels his frothy cheeke, Cause Diana is not meeke. Gaze you mortals, &amp;c. Jup. Come now my (Sister and Wife) wee'l begin To court afresh! Nay, loure not (Heavens Queene) Heere on this greene we'll a Lavalto dance, What if our haires grow silver, yet our strength, Is young, and vigorous! Say (fellow Gods) (Since we are full of Nectar, and our cares, Lye drencht in our Nepenthe) take your Queenes, and be all Ioviall, Mars for our Daughter Venus! Apollo joyne with Pallas! Brother of Flouds Embrace Diana! Gods sometimes merry be: But in the night, when mortals may not see. Each God as appointed by love, takes his Goddesse, they dance a Masque dance, and in the dance Juno observes loves glances to Eumorphe, and at the end of the dance, speaketh thus. Jup. How now (wanton?) Can I no where goe, For recreation but you follow me? Jun. Is this your Recreation? Fye! My Lord Will you be wanton still? For here you came Points at Eumorphe. For some new Harlot, some new Queene for you. Iup. Juno, Wife. Iuno. Your Sister, (thunderer,) and not your Wife! Banisht from Heaven I am; and your Bed, Resigne them both to Strumpets, Concubines, Points at Eumorphe. And now you come to see a fresh new lasse In which Pole now or in what part of heaven, Shall she be stellified? Jupit. Shall still sinister thoughts wrong our intent, Wel (Iuno) wel, you'le ever be a woman, A very, very woman! But since she scolds, Let's hence (yee Gods) lest her infectious breath Blast the succeeding day: and mortals curse Her hel-bred jealousie: Calumnious woman Come scold in heaven! For if Gods liv'd on Earth Suspitious tongues would blame most innocent mirth. Here all the Gods and Goddesses ascend at the top of the ascent, Iuno stops and speakes. Iun. Wel! Iove lookt pale! I toucht him to the quicke! 'Tis some new Minion he came downe to see! Harke (jealousie) know Juno is a woman! Am I not mad yet? Mistris Bride, adiew: Jove shal not steale a kisse? My curse is past, When thou sleep'st first a Bride, mayst sleepe thy last. Exit. Cupid. Faire Bride I sang thy Epithalamy, And left Elisium for thy Nuptials: Iuno here thundered 'gainst the Thunderer, Knowing how thy beauty dazles hers, She durst not let heavens King once glance a looke, But threatned with her helbred incantations, To metamorphise thine unparaleld And most cælestiall shape into worse formes; And more prodigious than ever poysoned charmes. Wrought on the fabled Concubines of Iove: But know great Queene, my Mother Venus vowes Her everlasting guard to save such beauty, Lest if thou perish, Nature her selfe Loose her onely patterne of serenity, But I must hast, Love which the Gods protect, Can never be indangered by neglect. Ascendit. Amur. Scahin, thine Art is excellent; but say, Doe Gods fall out for love amongst themselves? Scah. My Lord, these are but fables: yet to make The shew more pertinent, and to grace your Queene, Conceipt tooke leave to put the frowne on Iuno. Eum. My Lords and friends, we shall be ever thankfull And rest a Debtor to your curtesie. Schah. Not so faire Queen, but durst I now entreat The Kings detaining from the sweets of Bed, There yet remaines one thought upon conceipt, Which you would doubly grace me to behold. Amur. Our worthy Tutor shall obtaine a Night, A night of us, in any case we can! Scah. But then let me informe your Majesty, That 'tis a warriers shew, which once you loved, But now are free from. Amur. 'Tis best of all, with greedinesse we'l see it, O how the soule doth gratulate it selfe When safely it beholds the dangerous state Of others, and it selfe securely free! Glad are we still to stand upon the shore, And see a farre off others tost in the Sea, Or in a Gallery at a Fencers stage, We laugh when mutually each one takes wounds; Sit still (Eumorphe) Scahin, thy shew in hast; 'Tis best delight, to thinke on troubles past. Scæna, 5. Enter in Masque the Ghost of Hector and Achilles, to them Alexander the great stands gazing on them, whilst Fame speakes from aloft. Fame. Stay you most worthy shades! brave Hector stay! And proud Achilles, know your massie Tombes, Which have so long orewhelm'd your valiant bones Yawnes wide to let the imprisoned coarses forth. I must afresh imbalme your sacred Trunkes, And sweet your memory with most happy oyle, Of just report, the Gods awakt me Fame From out the oblivious Sepulcher of sleepe, To drop that Inke into old Homers pen, Werewith he curiously hath lin'd your names, Enfolding them in Everlasting Cedar, And made them live to all posterity.

Exit. Fame. Brave Macedon, how truly hast thou weighed, The reason of mans birth, who is equall borne, For all the world, as well as for himselfe. The world's a field too narrow for thy worth!

      <field name="fulltext">Actus, II. Scæna, I. Enter Schahin, Eurenoses. Schah. Observ'd you not the Kings looks? Grew they not pale? Euren. O yes (Lord Scahin) you must be his Parent? And snatch him out'h the Gulph he's falling in, That fayned speech of Alexanders wrought Like to most purging Physicke, nights then blacke When 'tis compar'd with day: Boldnesse is cleare, When 'tis presented before bastard feare. Schah. Ile tell thee (Eurenoses) thou art a Souldier: And I am both a Souldier, and a Scholler, And for these two Professions, am both most glorious: And most meritorious, Pallas is for both: O what Tysiphon, what snaked scourge Can make a Scholler, that should never sleepe, But 'twixt the Pillowes of Pernassus Hils, And dip his lips in springs of Helicon, Make him by snoaring on a wanton breast, And sucke the adulterate and spiced breath Of a lewd fained woman? Euren. And for a Souldier (Scahin,) let me speake! We that doe know the use of swords, and fire, We that doe know, halters can throatle us, Shall we ere venture on a Womans cruelty? We that endure no Lords, shall we endure: A woman to overcome us? Most true Demophoon! I reverence thy memory, no pewling phrase Could so enchaine thee to thy Thracian Dame, But thou wouldst rather perish than she save thee. Ile not declaime long on that common Theame, But they have lust lyeth in their fingers ends, And whilst their sweet-hearts breath stickes in their sheets, They will admit another, Lucrece in the day To be a Thais, if the night will not gain-say. Scah. Why (Eurenoses) why should we endure A new Queen now? this Kingdom wants not heires? We know (should we have more) 'twere dangerous, But harke! The Queens for Bed, inticing sleepe soft Musicke. With charmes of Musicke: wel, even such a Night, May yet prove dismall ere the following Light! Eurenos. Scahin, let's in: The first degree to purge such ils as these, Is to instruct the patient his disease: That you have done. Scah. Yea, and wil yet once more Adventure a new stratagem, just when the King H'as rid his Chamber, and with covetous hast Thinks for to clip Elizium, and drinke deepe Of his long wished delight, I having skil And uncontroul'd accesse, will in disguise Seeme his deceased Fathers apparition: And by all tyes of children to their Parents, Bid him forsake that vile bewitching woman. Euren. An easie Medicine doth and sure wil work, To rub shrewd wounds, make them but fester more, Foule Medicines we worse brook, than a foule sore. Scæna 2. Enter Eumorphe as to Bed in her Night-robes, attended with Tapers and Ladies. Menthe. Madam make hast! The King will be impatient If he be from you long. O Happinesse. Eumorph. Why Menthe, then thou deem'st us happy now Thus to command a world of services, To have a King my subject; and attended With these harmonious sounds t'affect our eares? Menthe. Yes (truly Madam) 'tis a happinesse. Eumorph. 'Tis, were't Eternal: but I feare a power A womans power, doth but make sport with us; Why, were we not once Menthe, a Captive (Wretch?) Menthe. Yes Lady! now your happinesse the more: Riches please best, when there went want before. Eum. That power which rais'd us from so base, so high, Can throw us downe againe as suddainly: Methinks my life is but a Players Scæne, In the last Act my part was then to play, A Captive creature, and a Queene to day. Menthe. Your Morals (Madam) are too serious; Me thinks these Ornaments should elevate Your dumpish spirits. Thinke this Bed a place In which no Icie slipping chance hath power; A Kings safe Bed is like a guarded Tower. Eum. No (Menthe) no, 'tis not the Bed of state, Nor the free smile of a well pleased King: 'Tis not the embracing Armes of Emperors, Nor all the Gemmes that so inwreath the browes Can so allure Fortune unto their gaze, As she should still be constant; O she's blind, Nor doth she know her selfe where she is kind; Close, those are Kings, and Queenes whose brest's secure Like brazen walles, Lust's entrance not endure! Where impotent ambition not intrudes, Nor the unstable talke of multitudes; Fortune semes such, they happinesse command More than all Lybia's gold, all Tagus sand; As Heaven hath given us no more conspicuous thing Than forme or beauty: so like a forward spring. Nothing more short. Menthe. Madam, divine not of a change; Beliefe Seneca: Prona in timore semper in prius fides.Is too prone, in entertaining griefe! Eum. Our Lord attends to enter in, And surely sleepe envyeth his delight, For he sits heauy on my drowsie liddes, Draw all our Curtaines; sleepe beguiles our eares. Menthe.

Drop golden showers, gentle sleepe, And all the Angels of the Night, Which doe us in protection keepe, Make this Queene dreame of delight Morpheus be kind a little, and be Deaths now true Jmage, for 'twill prove To this poore Queene, that then thou art hee; Her grave is made i'th Bed of love: Thus with sweet sweets can Heaven mixe gall, And marriage turne to Funerall. Sæna 3. Enter Amurath in his Night robes, a Taper in his hand, seemes much disturbed, speakes. Amur. Turke, Amurath, slave nay something baser, King! For all aery titles which the Gods Have blasted man withall, to make them swell With puft up honour, and ambitious wind, This name of King holds greatest antipathy With manly government, for if we waigh, 'Tis subjects, and not King beare all the sway. Each whispered murmur from their idle breath, Condemnes a King to Infamy, to death; Were there a Metempsucocosis of soules, And nature should a free Election grant What things they afterwards would reinforme The vaine and haughtiest minds the Sun ere saw, Would chuse it's Cottage in some Shepheards flesh, Nay, be confin'd within some Dog or Cat, Than Antique like prancke in a Kings gay-clothes, Were I no King, and had no Majesty, I had more than all Kings, blest liberty; And without rumor might enjoy my choyce, Not fearing Censure of each popular voyce; Poore men may love, and none their wils correct: But all turne Satyres of a Kings affect! O my base greatnesse! What disasterovs starre, Profest it selfe a Midwife at my birth, To shape me into such prodigious States, But hence regard of tongues! Were we a Saint, Some envious tongue would dare our names to taint: And he from slander is at securest rest, Not that hath none, but that regards it least. Open you envious Curtaines here's a sight, Drawes the Curtain. That might commend the act of Love so Chast; Were now the chariot-guider of the Sunne Weary on's taske, and would intreat a day Of Heauen, to rest in, here's a radiant Looke, That might be fixt ith' midst oth' Axletree; And in despight of darke conspiring Clouds, She would out-shine Sunne, Moone, and all the Stars, O, I could court thee now (my sweet) a fresh, Mixing a kisse with every period: Telling the Lillies how they are but wanne, Earth in the vernant spring is dull, and darke, Compar'd with this aspect! the Æasterne ayre, Famed with the wings of Mercury and Jove, Infectious, but compar'd with this perfume! Hence then th'ambition of that furious Alex. youth, Who knew not what a crime his rashnesse was! I might orecome more Kingdomes; have more dominion Enthrone my selfe an Emperor! oth' world, I might! I might! Amurath thou mightst! The Christians now will scoffe at Mahomet; Perchance they sent this wretch thus to inchant me! O my perplexed thoughts! tush Ile to bed Should the commanding Thunder of the Gods Prohibite me, or strike me in the act! Talke on (vaine rumor) fame I dare thy worst! Call me a Lusty, Lazy, wanton, Coward! Should I win all the world, my breath once fled, My bad would still survive, all good be dead. Eumorphe, sweet, I come! you sacred powers, Who have bestowed some happinesse on man, To helpe to passe away this sinful Life, Grant me a youthfull vigor yet a while, Full veines, free strength, compleat and manly fence To know, and taste a beauty most immense! Scæn 4. Amurath makes haste to the Bed, on a suddaine enter Schahin disguised like the Ghost of Orchanes father to Amurath. Scahin. Amurath, Amurath? Amur. Divel, Divel? What? Dar'st thou appeare before an Angell (Fiend?) Scah. O Amurath, why doth intemperate Lust Raging within thy furious youthfull veines, Burst through thy fathers Tombe? Disturbe his soule? Know, all the torments that the fabulous age Dream't, did afflict deceased impious Ghosts, Hartbiting-hunger, and soule-searching thirst, The nere consumed, yet ever eaten prey That the devouring Vulture feeds upon, Are not such tortures as our off-springs crimes! They, they sit heavy on us, and no date Makes our compassionate affection cease. O thou hereditary Vlcer, hearke By the name of Father, and by all those cares, Which brought me to my grave, to make thee great Thou that hast nothing of me but my crowne: My enterprise surpast the boundlesse Sea, Cutting the churlish Waves of Hellespont, When the flood stood which wind for to obey! Euxinum groan'd beneath my burdenous Ships; I was the first of all the Turkish Kings That Europe knew, and the fond Christians plague What coward blood ran flowing in my veines, When thou wert first begot: who marrest all Thy Fathers acts, by thy untam'd desires, Wherefore with Stygian curses I will lade thee First, may she prove a Strumpet to thy Bed Be her lips poyson, and let her loose embrace, Be venemous as Scorpions! If she conceiv'd, A Generation from thee, let it be As ominous as thou hast beene to me! Rebellious to thy Præcepts, printing cares, Vpon thy aged browes, O may they prove, As Faeries for to lash thee in thy rest! But Amurath, if thou canst quench this flame, If thou wilt cut this Gordian thred, and rend hence, That putrid Wenne which cleaves unto thy flesh, Be all thine actions prosperous! Mahomet, Shall be auspitious unto each designe; Fortune to shew thee favour shall be proud, Farewell! if that men doe speake last, before They dye, take root, then dead mens should take more. Exit Scahin. Amur. What art thou vanisht? Know (thou carefull spright) Thou shalt no sooner pierce the wandring Clouds With unperceived flight, than my resolue Shall expiate my former Vanity! Looke on thy sonne thou (aery intellect) And see him sacrifice to thy command! Now Titan turne thy breathing curses backe! Start hence bright day, a sable Cloud invade This Vniversall Globe, breake every prop, And every hindge that doth sustaine the Heavens: For straight must dye a woman, I have named A crime, that may accuse all Nature guilty. The Sexe wisely considered, deserves a death; For thinke this (Amurath) this woman may, Prostrate her delicate and Ivory limbes, To some base Page, or Scul, or shrunk up Dwarf: Or let some Groome lye feeding on her lips, She may devise some mishapen trick, To satiate her goatish Amurath, And from her bended knees at Meditation, Be taken by some slave toth' deepe of Hell! Th'art a brave Creature, wert thou not a woman: Tutor! Come! thou shalt see my well-kept vow, And know my hate, which saw me dote but now: Schahin! Eurenoses! Captaines ho! Scæna, 5. Enter, Schahin, Eurenoses, Chase-Illibegge. Our Tutor, Eurenoses, Captaines, welcome! Gallants, I call you to a spectacle: My breast too narrow to hoard up any joy: Nay, gaze here (Gentlemen!) give Nature thanks, For framing such an excellent sence as (Sight) Whereby such objects are injoy'd as this! Which of you now imprison not your thought In envious and silent policy. Scah. My Lord to whatsoever you shall propose, My sentence shall be free. Euren. And mine. Chase-Il. And mine. Am. Which of you then dare chalenge to himself, Such a pathetique a Prærogative, So stoically severed from affection, That had he such a Creature as lyeth here, One, at whom Nature her selfe stood amazed: One, whom those lofty extasies of Poets, Should they decay, here 't must not barely dump Their dull inventions with similitudes, Taken from Sunne, Moone, Violets, Roses, And, when their raptures at a period stand; A silent admiration must supply Onely name her, and she is all describ'd. Hyperbole of women, Colour it selfe Is not more pure, and incontaminate! Sleep doates on her: and grasps her eye-lids close; The sky it selfe hath onely so much blew As the azure in her veines, bends by reflexe. Here's breath that would those vapors purifie, Which from Avernus choakes the flying Birds! Here's heat would tempt the numb'd Atkenian, Though all his bloud with age were conjealed yce! Now, which of you all is so temperate; That, did he find this Iewel in his Bed (Vnlesse an Eunuch) could refraine to grapple, And dally with her? Come! Speake freely all. Sca. Truly (my Lord) I came of mortall Parents, And much confesse me subject to desires; Freely injoy your Love! That were she mine, I surely would doe no lesse. Amur. What sayth Eurenoses? Euren. My Lord, I say; That they may raile at light, that nere saw day; But, had I such a Creature by my side Were the world twice enlarged, and all that world Orecome by me, all volumes writ, Made cleane and fild up by Rhetorique straines: Of my great deeds, Historians should spend Their Inke and Paper in my sole Chronicle, A thousand such alluring idle charmes, Could not conjure me from betwixt her armes. Amur. Your sentence Chase Jll Beg? Chas. What need your Grace depend upon our breath? I vow (my Lord,) if all those scrupulous things Which burden us with præcepts so præcise, Those Parents which when they are married once And past their strength of yeares, thinke their sonnes straight, Should be as old in every thing as they, I say my Lord, did my head weare a Crowne That Queen should be the chiefest jem t'adorne it, Spite of all hate, that's an unhappy state When Kings must feare to love, least subjects hate. Amur. Wel spoke three Milk-sops, Schahin! Your Sword! Now, now be valour in this manly arme Scahin gives him a Sword. To cut off troupes of thoughts that would invade me! Thinke you my minde is waxie to be wrought, By any fashion, Orchanes thy strength, Here doe I wish as did that Emperour, That all the heads of that inticing Sexe, Were upon hers, thus then should one full stroake Mow them all off. Heere Amurath cuts off Eumorphes head, shewes it to the Nobles. There, kisse now (Captaines) doe! and clap her cheeke; This is the face that did so captive me: These were the lookes that so bewitcht mine eyes; Here be the lips, that I but for to touch, Gave over Fortune, Victory, Fame, and all; These were two lying mirrors where I lookt And thought I saw a world of happinesse. Now Tutor, shall our swords be exercised, In ripping up the breasts of Christians. Say Generals! Whether is first? All. For Thracia! Amurath. On then for Thracia, for he surely shall That conquers first himselfe, soone conquer all. Exeunt omnes.</field>

That Winter should uncloth our Mother Earth, And wrap her in a winding sheet of snow; That then the spring duly revives her still, Vnlinds her sinews, fils her cling'd up veynes, With living dew, and makes her young againe; Next that, the Nemean terror breathes her flames, To parch her flaxie haires with furious heat; Which to allay too, thou op'st the Chataracts, And watereth the worlds Gardens with blest drops; Canst thou, which canst sustain the ponderous world, And keepst in true poize, securely sleepe, Letting a Tyrant (which with a Philip, thus; Thou mightest sinke to Earth) to baffle thee?

To betray all Garrisons, and turne Turke. Thou halfe Can-carousing rascall, Ile teare thee, And those treacherous veines of thine, will you see. Llew-Jackets. Will you see your Corporall wrong'd? Well, since I fight for victuals for company, Vse now your swords and Bucklers. The other to his men. Here they all fall by the eares. Lazar. Treason the next man that speakes or strikes a blow! Sold. Then shall our Laundresses fight for us. 2. Why, Amazons! Baudicans, come helpe to scratch! Enter some Truls on both sides, they fight and scratch. Sesm. O Cobelitz, what way shall we appease them? Truls scold confusedly: thus. 1. Trull. Out thy Corporal (huswife) hath the itch, You now will have foule washing, Drab ile teare your mouth; 2. An inch or two yet wider. Cob. What, souldiers thinke you each distastfull word, Given 'mongst your selves so strong an obloquie The Generall parts them with his sword. That revenge spurs you to each others death? And will not seeke to wash those blasphemies, In Seas of their foule blood, which they belcht out. By our approaching foes, against the Essence Of the Eternall. Laz. Leave, leave, these factions; cease these Mutinies! A Drum from the Turke's Campe. Harke their Drums take advantage of these stirres! Let us oppose our strength against our foe! And in our Campe let not one souldier be, Who will not finde and strike his Enemies. Cob. Now (blest guider and great strength of armes) If in thy secret and hid decree, Thou hast not yet appointed the full time, Wherein thou meanest to tame this tyger, Who dare murmur against thine hidden will? Be we slaine now, there's victory in store, Which when thou pleasest thou't give, &amp; not before. Give us still strength of patience, not to wish, A funerall honour unto all the world, When we are perishing we'l still beleeve, Those dangers worth our death we undergoe. Whilst who is ours, is all alike thy foe; Should fortune loose this day when we are slaine, Thou canst give hands, and strength, and men againe; On thee we trust then, and on thee beare, Scorning for Heavens sake to shed a teare. Scæna 4. A march within, excursions, alarmes. Enter as Conquerours, Cairadin Bassa, Scahin, leading young men Christians, Prisoners. Schah. Bassa! we thanke thy valor and discretion, In finding fit occasion to invade The mutinous Christians! these Captives here Shall be good presents to our worthy Master. Bassa. Generall now trust me these young slaves, To be full of Valor, they have mettall in them. Schah. Yes; and to his Highnesse shall performe A service which I long have thought upon, And which his Turkisk Majesty requires; They'l fit to be a neare attendant guard, On all occasions to the Emperour; Therefore they shall be called Janizaries. By me first instituted, for our Princes safeties sake. Bass. Their vigor and strong hearts becomes such service, For to orecome them made our soldiers sweat, Much Turkish blood: the Servians kept the Fight, With stubborne hard resistance, The Bulgarians Left the right wing; there set I forward first, And like a torrent rowl'd destruction on, Raising huge stormes of bloud, as doth the Whale, Puffe up the Waves against a mighty Ship; Me thinkes I see the Rivers of their gore: Their Leaders trampled on by Turkish Horse, The body of their army quite disperst; Themselves all floating in Vermillian pooles, With their owne weapons hasting to their death. And such a slaughter did we make of them, As Nature scarce can ere repaire againe. One hasting to others death, pulling to ground, Him that held up, so they each other drown'd. Scah. Still are they confident upon a power, They know not what, who (as they think) can snatch Their præcise soules from out the jawes of death. Bass. Yes, such a superstition doth possesse them, For when they lookt for nothing but their fate, And danger stood in sweat upon their browes? They yet scorn'd Mahomet, and prophan'd his rites, And nought but horror made them to beleeve him; So many men were fighting on his side: As might have chang'd my seat, and part ith' world, (Though Nature stood against) to a new place: Or carry Sestos whereby Abydos stands, Or pull downe Atlas with so many hands, Scæna 5. Enter Amurath with Embassadours from Germaine Ogly, concerning Bajazet, Amurath's Eldest sonne, and the Mahometans Daughter. Cairadin Bassa presents Amurath with his Captives for Ianizaries, Schahin. &amp;c. Amurath. How like our Captaines the last Victory? (If any can prophesie of future things) Me thought I did dreame of this blessed hap, How Fortune did involue them in their ruine, And slight from danger, brought them into danger, Each one astonished with a suddaine feare, Knew not the danger that was then most neare. Bassa. To adde more tryumph, I present my Liege, Bassa &amp; Schahin presents Amurath with Captives for Ianizaries. With these young Rebels, which you may bring up, In all the præcepts of our Mahomet: Scah. And for great Emperor, your person wants, A thing which much ore-Clouds your light of state, Attendant Ianizaries to a Prince: These may be so trained up, as to supply The duty fit for such a Majesty: Am. Bassa we thanke thy strength: Schahin your counsaile, And to that end, let them have safe protection. But we must treat now of a marriage (Lords) The German Ogry, he who Scepter swayes The Phrygian confines in strong Asia, By Embassie intreates that he may joyne His Daughter Hatam to our Bajazet! Embassador here to our Councell speake, Your Masters Message. Emb. Please then your Maj. and these reverend heads To be inform'd my Masters will by me, In Wedlocke; if your Prince may be combin'd To the faire Princesse his sole Daughter: He freely giues the Phrygian territories, And Bythinia to you for your Dowry; Catar, Simon, Egreglos, Sansale, Abbettingon, the Ottomans estate, Which Ottomans, because he not endures, The Noble Zelzueciom family protests, To joyne with you in quelling their ambition. Scah. May't please your Majesty to like mine advice It's good to have allyance with such friends; Kings that combine themselves are like to shafts, The ancient Sage propos'd unto his sonne! Which whilst together they were close compact: Armes, knees, and his whole strength, could never breake; Take one by one, they with a touch were tract, So Kings may be orecome that stand alone; But two such Princes, knit thus hand in hand, Should Nations totter, they would firmely stand. Am. Yes Schahin we'll approve what thou sayest; Then from us carry the great Asians Monarch, This his kindest greeting: Tell him the gates of Prusa shall stand ope, And the glad ayre shall Eccho notes of joy, To entertaine her who shall blesse our Land, With hopefull issue; greedy thoughts expect Her soone arrivall; and so (Embassador) Enforme thy Princesse, when she shall appeare, A lasting Starre shall shine within our Sphære! Scæna 6. Enter Sasmenos, Lazarus, Cobelitz. Sa. O Servia, our Cities are turned flames; Each stayes to hast his owne and others death: And as though Heaven conspir'd destruction too, That raignes downe scalding Sulphure on our heads, Here one that lyes thicke gasping for his breath, Is choakt with bloud that runs from's fellowes wounds, Whilst others for the dead are making Graves, Themselves are made the coarses that doe fill them! Nobles, and base, together perish all: And a drawne sword stickes fast in every rib; Our stones are dyes Vermillion with our bloud! Old creatures that are creeping to the graue, Are thrust on faster! Infants but in the threshold of their lives, And thus kickt off, O most disastrous times, To love our deaths, and make our life our crimes. Laz. See, see, the ruines of our goodly Walles, Our Cities smoake hinders the sight of heaven: The conquerour yet amaz'd measures out our Townes, With eyes of terror, and doth scarce beleeve He hath orecome us; yet among these fires, Our dead men are denyed their funerall flames: And those infectious Carkasses doe performe, A second murder on the rest that live! And all the hope of safety that we have, Is now to fixe our flattering lips at's feet: Mercy (perhaps) may wearied slaughter meet. Sas. Wil you doe so? speake for I am determin'd Cob. No (worthy Generall) Heaven avert And arme you with the proofe of better thoughts! What though a Tyrant strives to terrifie All Christendome, and would not be beloved? Let not your feares give impious rage such scope! As for to bring Religion to prophanesse: Fortune and Heaven will scorne to try a man, That hurles his weapons hence and runs away! How is he worthy of heavens victory; That, when it frownes, dares not looke up and see? Me thinks we three are now inviron'd round, With hosts of Angels, and our powerfull Mars. Is putting bowes of steele into our hands: He doth suggest our wrath, and bids us, on! O what an army 'tis to have a cause Holy and just; there, there's our strength indeed. ? Tu mente Labantes, Dirige nos, dubios: Certo Robore firmâ. If we must dye, the narrow way to blisse, Shall be made wide for us, the gate wide ope, And the spread Pallace entertaines with joy. Meane time, let's looke like men upon our griefe. Out frowne fate, Despot, Bulgaria, come! Turke! once more at thee (Tyrant) mortals must, Command Heavens favor in a cause so just. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus IIII. Scæna 1. Enter Aladin King of Caramania, sonne in Law to Amurath, with Nobles, Embassadors from Amurath. Aladin. Sends our proud father in Law this greeting to us? Was our sword sheath'd so soone to heare this answer? Embass. My Lord, he bad me tell you that 'twas you Have made him leave off this great Prophets Warres, When he was hewing downe the Christians; Therefore submission should not now appease him, Mo, though your Wife, his Daughter, should her selfe, Vpon her penitent knees be supplyant! No sooner shall the Tycian splendent Sol, Open Heavens Casements, and inlarge the day, But his horse hoofes shall beat your treacherous Earth; And that you may be warn'd of his approach, Murder and flames shall be his Prodromo's! Alad. Confederate Princes and my kind allyes, Shall his proud nosthrils breath those threats on us? Emb. Moreover, my Lord wil or win, or raze, Iconium and Larenda. Alad. Iconium and Larenda? I? No more? Had best looke first, how safe his Prusa stands! Lords, I am mov'd, and will forget my Queene Was ere the issue of his hated blood! My splene is tost within; mine entrailes pant, As, wen the Sea is rais'd with Southerne gusts, The wind allay'd, yet still the Waves will tremble, Princes, now binde your selves with such strong chaines, Your faith and breaths can make; sweare to me all, To be as firme to me 'gainst Amurath, As is the skin and flesh unto the Nerves; Here they all kneele, and sweare vpon his sword. Nobles. We all sweare we will. Aladin. Then all here kisse my Sword, Which shall be steept within the head-mans throat: We'l make him know those will not flye in Warre, Which may in policie intreat a peace! Hast thy course (time) and soone reduce the yeare! Ensignes may Ensignes meet, Carmania's King, Great Aladin, scornes to avoyd a Turke: Princes, and Neighbours, muster up your strength, That we may meet him on his full Cariere! And let it be Carmania's pride to say, To overcome him we askt no second day. Scæna 2. Enter Amurath at one doore with Nobles Bajazet, Enter at th'other, Hatam, richly attended, they meet, salute in dumbe shew; Amurath ioynes the hands of the Prince, and Princesse; whilst this is solemnizing, is sung to soft Musicke, this Song following. Song. Thine O Hymen, thine: O shee, Whose Beauties verse Calliope, Sing to Marriage rites an Io, Io to Hymen. Chorus. To thee Apollo is my sute, Lend me a while thy silver Lute, O what a woe it is to bring, A Bride to Bed and never sing. Io to Hymen. When she's old, still seemes she young, When she's weake, to her be strong! Be Cyprus, both, and Paphos here, Love, sing with merry cheere. Io to Hymen. Am. You Gods of Marriage: sacred Protectoresse Of lawfull propagations, and blest Love Be most propitious to these grafted stemmes! Drop dewing showers of generation on them! Thinke (Sonne) this day too prodigall of blessing As, that had Juno taskt thee (like Alcides) To grapple with Stymphallides, or clense Angelas stables: or like the Trojan Boy, Sit like a Shepheard on Dardadias Hils, Such a reward as this faire Queen repayres, O thou hop'd future off-spring spare thy Parent! Hurt not this tender wombe, these Ivory worlds, When you are borne; O be within your limbes, The Grandsire Amurath, and fathers strength! Line their faces (Nature) with their Mothers dye! And let the Destinies marke the ensuring night In their Eternall Bookes, with notes most white. All. Grant it great Mahomet! Hatam. Most awfull father and my honored Prince, Although it be enacted by the Heavens, That in these bonds of marriage such curse Attends on Princes above private men, That nor affection, nor home-nourisht Love But state and policy must elect their Wives. Which must be fetcht from Countries farre remote! Yet the protecting Powers have such a care, Both of their off-springs and their Kingdomes state, That to what they ordaine, they worke in us A suddaine willingnesse to make us obey; For, in this brest, I doe already feele That there's a kindling a Diviner heat: Which disobedience never shall extinguish. And, if there be any felicity From these united Loves to be derived From the weake sexe into the husbands soule, Then may my Lord make his affection sure, To be repayd with unattainted Love, In which a pritty people ye shall live, With soft and yeilding curtesie in all He shall command, my willing armes shall still, Be ope t'enfold within a Wives embrace, If any comfort else there be in store, (Which modesty keeps silent to it selfe) Cause onely husbands and the night must know't, My Loyalty shall ever all performe, And (though my) Lord should frown, Ile be the same, Greene wood will burne with a continued flame: Baiaz. Princesse our ardor is already fired, Yet with no violent temerity; Such as might feare it's short and soone decaying; Thy vertue seemes so to exceed thy Sexe, And wisdome so farre to out-pace thy yeares, That, surely (Ptincesse) soone maturity, Argues in them, hidden Divinity. Expected (Hymen) here hath bound our hands, And hearts, with everlasting ligaments: Fortunate both we are, and have one blisse The want of which for ever doth infect, With anxious cares the sweets of marriage Beds: Our Parents benediction and consent, They are the truest Hymens, and should be To children the best marriage Deity. Thus then attended with such sacred charmes Our last day of content shall never come; Till we must part by th'unresisted doome, With a pleas'd error we will age beguile, All starres on us, an æquall yoke must smile. Amur. Now (Lords) who'le dance A Turkish measure? Ladies our nerves are shrunke; And you now fixe the signe of age on me, You who have bloud still flowing in your veynes, Be nimble as an Hart: Caper to the Sphæres! O you are light, that wrnt the weight of yeares! Musicke. Here Amurath ascends his Throne, the rest set downe to dance, Bajazet with Hatam, &amp;c. the end of the dance, all kneele, Amurath begin an health, a flourish with Cornets. Amur. And health to our Bride and her father! O (Nobles) would this wine were Christians blood, But that it would Phrenetique humours breed, And so infect our braines with Superstition! Enter Eurenoses with sixe Christian Maidens, richly attyred, their Haire hanging loose, in their hands Cups of Gold with Iewels, &amp;c. Euren. Auspitious fortunes to great Amurath! To ope more springs unto this full tide of joy, Know (potent Emperor) I from Europe bring Sixe daughters of sixe severall Kings, Whose Cities we have equall'd to the ground; And of their Pallaces did torches make, To light their soules through the blacke Cave of death (Acher?) Am. Describe (good Captaine) how the dogs were wearied. Euren. So weary were they to indure to indure our swords, That by impetuous mutiny themselves, Turn'd on each other; slew their Maisters; Childrens own hands, tore out their fathers throats. And each one strove who should be slaughtered first; Here did a brother pash out a Brothers braines, Some in stinking Quagmires, and deepe Lakes (Which they had made t'avoyd their excrements) Ran quicke, and in the lake lay buried. Am. (Goon Executioner of our most just wrath!) Eu. Nor did it leave till death it selfe was weary: Murder grew faint, and each succeeding day, Shewed us the slaughter of the day before. 'Mongst carkasses and funerals we stoood, Denying those that liv'd such Ceremonies As in their Temples to the Indian Gods, With prayers and vowes they dayly offred: Nor destiny, nor cruelty ere left, Till they had nothing to worke upon; For, of so many soules that breath'd These sixe are all remain'd: which as a Pledge Of my best service to your Majesty. I here am bold to yeeld an offer. Am. Nor shall this present be unrecompenced; For thy true service, on thee Ile bestow All the rich guifts, which all these Asian Lords Brought to adore these happy Nuptials, On you faire Bride great Princesse and our Daughter Doe we bestow these Virgins (daughters to Kings) For your attendance. Hat. We are too much bound unto our Princely Father! Am, No (Daughter) no! we hope thou art the spring, From whence shall flow to all the world a King. (Captaines and Lords, to morrow we must meet, To thinke of our rebellious sonne in Law) Be this time all for comfort and delight, Short wedding dayes make it seeme long to night. Exeunt omn. Scæna 3. Enter Lazarus and Cobelitz, bringing the dead body of Sesmenos. Laz. Here set we downe our miserable load, O Cobelitz with whom is't that we fight? With Lydian Lyons, and Hyrcanian Beares; Which grinde us dayly in their ravenous teeth? The Tyrant (as it were destructions Enginere) Helpe Nature to destroy the worlds frame quickly, Cob. Alas my Lord that needs not, every day Is a sufficient helper to decay: Great workman, who art sparing in thy strength To bring things to perfection, and to oreturne All thy best workes, thou usest suddaine force, When mans an Embrio! and first conceived How long 'tis ere he see his native light? Then borne, with expectation for his growth! Tenderly nourisht, carefully brought up, Growne to perfection, what a little thing, Serves to call on his suddaine ruining? Laz. Come Cobelitz, 'mongst those demolisht stones We'll sit as Hecuba, at those Troyan Walles: Our teares shall be false glasses to our eyes: Through these we'l looke, and thinke we yet may see Our stately Pinacles, and strong founded holds; That which one houre can delapidate, One age can scarce repaire. Cob. No sir, for nothing's hard To Nature, when she meanes t'consume A thousand Oakes (which time hath fixt i'th earth, As Monuments of lasting memory) Are in a moment turn'd to ashes all; Things that rise slowly, take a suddaine fall. Laz. What course now Cobelitz, must we still be yoak To misery, and murder? We scarce have roome, Vpon our bodies to receive more wounds, And must we still oppose our selves to more? Cob. Yes! We are ready still; a solid minde Must not be shakt with every blast of Winde! Pollux, nor Hercules, had none other art, To get them Mansions in the spangl'd Heavens Then a true firme resolve; th'Adriatike Sea, Shall from his currents with tempestuous blasts, Be sooner heard, than vertue from it's ayme, Let us but thinke (when we so many see, Enjoying greater quiet than our selves.) How many have endur'd more misery; Ilion, Ilion, what a fate hadst thou? How fruitfull wert thou in matter for thy foe? Thus we'll delude our griefe, make our selfe glad, To think of miseries that others had. Laz. I (Captaine) I! they that furnisht thee With sentences of comfort, never saw, Their Cities burnt, their Countries desolate! 'Tis easie for Physitians for to tell Advice to others, when themselves are well! Cob. Tush, tush (my Lord) there's on our side we know, One that can both, and will our weake hands guide, One that will strike and thunder; Gyant then, Looke for a dart! we must not appoint when; Meane while helpe for to convay this burden hence Turke, though thy tyranny deny us graves, Corruption will give them spite of thee! Nor doe our corps, such Tombes and Cavernes need: For our owne flesh, still our owne graves to breed: And, when the Earth receiveth not, when they die; Heavens Vault ouerwhelmeth them, so their tombe's ith' skie. Exeunt with a dead Truncke. Scæna 4. Enter Aladin as flying, an arrow through his arme, wounded in his forehead, his shield stacke with darts: with him two Nobles. Alad. Besieged on every side? Iconium taken? Entrencht within my foes my selfe must lye Wrapt in my Cities ruine! Turkes come on! 1. Nob. Nay but my Lord, meane you to meet your death? Let's hast our flight, and trust more to our feet Then words, or hands— Alad. Why, so much of our bloud Is already spilt, as should the glittering Sunne Exhale it upward, 'twould obnubulate It's luster, else to fiery Meteors turne. Some councell (Lords) he that's amidst the Sea, When every curled wave doth threat his death Yet trusts upon the oares of his owne armes, And sometimes the salt fome doth pitty him, A Wolfe, or Lyon, that hath fild his gorge With bloudy prey, at last will lye to sleepe, And the unnaturalst creatures not forget Their love to those whom they do know their own! My wife's his Daughter; since we cannot stand His fury longer, she shall savage his wrath. The boysterous Ocean when as no winds oppose, Growth's calme revenge is lost, when't hath no foes. 2. Noble. Why then (my Lord) array your selfe in weeds, Of a Petitioner: take the Queene along, And your two children; they may move his eyes; For, desperate sores aske desperate remedies. Alad: Goe (Lords) goe: fetch some straight. O Heavens! O fortune they that leane on thy crackt wheele, And trust a Kingdomes power, and domineere In a wall'd Pallace, let them looke on me, And thee (Carmania) greater instances The world affords not to demonstrate The fraile estate of proudest Potentates, Of sturdiest Monarchies: high Pinacles Are still invaded with the prouder winds; They must endure the threats of every blast; The tops of Caucasus and Pindus shake, With every cracke of thunder; humble Vaults Are nere toucht with a bolt, ambiguous wings Hath all the state, that hovers over Kings. Enter the 2. Nobles with a winding sheet, Aladin puts it on. I, I, this vesture fits my miserie! This badge of poverty must now prevaile, Where all my Kingdomes power &amp; strength doth faile, Why should not a propheticke soule attend On great mens persons, and forewarne their ils? Raging Bootes doth not so turmoile The Lybian ford, as Fortune doth great hearts. Bestona and Erynnis scourge us on; Should wars and treasons cease, why our owne weight Would send us to the Earth; as spreading armes Make the huge trees in tempest for to split. For as the slaughter-man to pasture goes, And drags that Oxe home first, whose Bulke is greatest, The leane he still lets feed: disease takes hold On bodies that are pampered with best fare; So doth all ruine chuse the fairest markes: At which it bends, and strikes it full of shafts, Ambition made me now that eminent but: And I that fell by mine owne strength, must rise By profest weaknesse; Buckets full sinke downe: Whilst empty ones dance ith' ayre, and cannot drowne. Come (Lords) he out of's way can never range, Who is at furthest! worst nere finds ill change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus V. Scæna I. Enter at one doore Amurath, with attendants; at the other doore Aladin, his Wife, two Children, all in white sheets, kneele downe to Amurath. Amur. Our hate must not part thus, Ile tell thee (Prince) That thou hast kindled violent Ætna in our brest, And such a flame is quencht with nought but blood: His bloud whose hasty and rebellious blast, Gave life unto the fire; should Heaven threat us; Knowes we dare not menace it; are we not Amurath? (Whose awfull name is even trembled at) So often dar'd by Pigmy Christians; Which we will crush to ayre; what haughty thought Buzz'd thy præsumptuous eares with such vain blasts, To puffe thee into such impetuous acts? Or what, durst prompt thee with a thought so fraile, As made thee covetous of so brave a death? As this known hand should cause it? know that throat Shall feele it strangled with some slave brought up To nought but an Hangman: thy last breath, Torne from thee by a hand that's worse than death Alad. Why then, Ile (like the Roman Pompey) hide My dying sight, scorning Imperious lookes Should grace so base a stroake with sad aspect; Thus will I muffle up and choake my groanes, Least a griev'd teare should quite put out the name, Of lasting courage in Carmanias fame. Am. What? still stiffe necked? Is this the truce you beg? Sprinkled before thy face those Rebell Brats, Shall have their braines, and their dissected limbes, Hurld for a prey to Kites; for (Lords) 'tis fit No sparke of such a Mountaine threatning fire, Be left as unextinct, least it devoure, And prove more hot unto the Turkish Emperie, Then the Promithean blaze did trouble Iove! First sacrifice those Brats— All. Wife. (Deare father) let thy fury rush on me! Within these entrailes sheath thine unsatiate sword, And let this ominous, and too fruitfull wombe, Be torne in sunder? For from thence those Babes, Tooke all their crimes; error made them guilty, 'Twas Natures fault, not theirs; O if affection Can worke then; now shew a true Fathers Love, If not, appease those murdering thoughts with me: For as Jocasta pleaded with her sonnes For their deare Father, so to a Father I For my deare Babes and husband; husband, father. Which shall I first embrace? Victorious father, Be blunt those now sharpe thoughts! lay downe those threats, Vnclaspe that impious Helmet! fixe to earth That monumentall Spheare looke on thy child With pardoning lookes, not with a Warriers eye: Else shall my brest cover my husbands brest, And serve as Buckler to receive thy wounds, Why dost thou doubt? Fearest thou thy Daughters faith? Amur. I feare, for after Daughters perjurie All Lawes of Natures shall distastfull be; Nor will I trust thy children or thy selfe. All. Wife. No Father 'tis I, feare you him, he you, I both, but for you both, for both you warre; So that 'tis best with him that's overcome. O let me kisse (kind father) first the Earth On which you tread, then kisse mine husbands cheeke. Great King embrace these Babes! you are the stocke On which these Grafts were planted— Am. True, and when sprouts doe rob the tree of sap, They must be prun'd, Wife. Deare Father, leave such harsh similitudes! By my deceased Mother, (to whose wombe I was a ten months burden:) By your selfe, (To whom I was a pleasing Infant once) Pitty my husband, and these tender Infants! Am. Yes to have them collect a manly strength, And their first lesson that their Dad shall teach them Shall be to read my misery. Al. Sterne Conqueror: but that thy daughter shews, There once dwelt good in that obdurate brest, I would not spend a teare to soften thee! Thou seest my Countries turn'd into a Grave: My Cities scarre the Sunne with fiercer flames, Which turne them into ashes! all my selfe So slickt and carved, that my amazed blood Knowes not through which wound first to take it's way; If not on me, have mercy on my Babes!— Which, with thy mercy thou mayst turne to Love. Amurath. No sir, we must root out malitious seed: Nothing sproutes faster, then an envious weed! We see a little Bullocke, 'mongst an heard (Whose hornes are yet scarce crept from out his front) Growes on a suddaine tall, and in the Fields, Frolicks so much, he makes his Father yeild. A little twig left budding on an Elme (Vngratefully) barres his mother sight from Heaven! I love not future Aladins. Alad. Threat all a Conquerour can, canst threat but death, And I can die, but if thou wouldst have mercy!— Wife. O see you feete we're prou'd with this hands kisse! The higher those great powers have rais'd you, Presse that which lyes below with gentler weight: To pardon miseries is Fortunes height: Alas, these Infants, these weake sinewed hands Can be no terror to these Hectors armes! Beg (Infants) beg, and teach these tender joynt's To aske for mercy; learne your lisping tongues To giue due accent to each syllable: Nothing that Fortune urgeth too, is base; Put from your thoughts all memory of discent: Forget the Princely titles of your fathers: If your owne misery you can feele, Learne thus of me to weepe, of me to kneele! Al. Doe (boyes) and imitate your Parents teares, Which I (like Priam) shed, when he beheld, Hector thrice dragg'd about the Trojan Walles. He that burst ope the gates of Erebus, And rouz'd the yelling Monster from his Den, Was conquer'd with a teare! great Monarch learne, To know how deare a King doth weeping earne. 1. Ch. Good Grandsire see, see how my father cries! 2. Ch. Good mother take my napkin for your eyes! Wife. (Good father) heare, heare how thy daughter prayes: Thou that know'st how to use sterne Warriers armes, Learne how to use mild Warriers pitty too! Alas? can ere these ungrowne strengths repaire Their Fathers battered Cities? Or can these These orethrowne Turrets? (Jconium) what small hopes Hast thou to leane upon? If these be all? Not halfe so mild hath our misfortune beene That any can ere feare us: Be pleased— Am. Rise (my deere child) as Marble against raine, So I at these obedient showers, melt! Thus I doe raise thy husband: thus thy Babes: Freely admitting you to former state. But Aladin, wake not our wrath againe! “Patience growes fury that is often stirred; When Conquerours waxe calme, and cease to hate, The conquered should not dare to reiterate. Be thou our sonne and friend. Alad. By all the rites of Mahomet I vow it! Am. Then for to seale unto our love, Your selfe shall leade a wing in Servia, In our immediate Warres, we are to meet The Christians in Cassanoe's Plaines with speed: Great Amurath nere had time to breath himselfe: So much, as to have warring with new foes; No day securely to his Scepter shone, But one Warres end, still brought another on. Exeunt. Scæna 2. Enter Lazarus, Cobelitz, Souldiers, all armed. Cob. Let now victorious wreathes ingirt our browes, Let Angels 'stead of Souldiers wield our armes, 'Gainst him, who that our Citties might be his Strives to depopulate, and make them none! But looke, looke in the ayre (me thinks) I see An host of Souldiers brandishing their swords; Each corner of the Heaven shoots thunderbolts, To naile these impious forces to the Earth. Laz. Souldiers stand to't! though fortune bandy at's Let's stand her shockes, like sturdy Rockes ith' Sea. On which the angry foaming Billowes beat, With frivolous rush: and breake themselves, not them; Stand like the undainted countenance oth' sky, Or, like the Sunne, which when the foolish King, Thought to obscure with a Cloud of Darts, Out lookt them all, our lives are all inchanted, And more invulnerate than Thetis sonne. We shall have hands and weapons, if the stone, Of fortune glide from under our weake feet, And we must fall: yet, let all Christians say, 'Tis she, and not the cause, that wins the day. We must beleeve Heaven hath a greater care Of them, whom fortune doth so oft out dare! Cob. Gentlemen, brothers, friends Souldiers, Christians, We have no reason to command of Heaven A thing denyed to all mortality. Nor should we be so impudently proud, As in this weake condition to repute Our selves above the stroake of Lady Chance, A caution must divine it ever fixt, That whilst her checkes, equally fall out, Community should ease their bitternesse. I could afresh now shed those Princely teares To thinke such suddaine raine should attend Heroicke spirits glittering in bright armes! But if the Grecian (when he heard the dreames Disputed subtilly by Philosophers, To prove innumerable extant worlds) Was strucke with pensivenesse, and wept to thinke He had not yet obtain'd one for himselfe; What terror can affright a Christians thoughts Who knowes there is a world, at liberty To breath in, when this glasse of life is broke? Our foes with circling furie are intrencht; Pelions of earth and darknesse shall orelade them, Whilst we shall mount, and these our spirits light, Shall be yet ponderous to depresse them lower. Nay, my Enthesiasticke soule divines, That some weake hand shall from the blazing Zone Snatch Lightning, which shall strike the snarling Cur With horror and amazement to the Earth! Which Hell cannot oppose! Turke, Tyrannize! Stand, yet at length to fall my sacrifice. Super-Olympicke vigor will (no doubt) Squease all thy supercilious rancor out! Exeunt in a March. Scæna 3. The Heavens seeme on fire, Cornets and blazing Starres appeare, Amurath speakes. Am. Who set the world on fire? How now (ye Heavens) Grow you so proud that you must needs put on curl'd lockes: And cloth your selves in Periwigs of fire? Mahomet (say not but I invoke thee now!) Command the puny-Christians demi-God Put out those flashing sparkes, those Ignes fatui, Or ile unseate him, or with my Lookes so shake The staggring props of his weake seated Throne, That he shall finde he shall have more to doe To quell one Amurath, then the whole Gyant brood Of those same sonnes of Earth then ten Lycaons! Doe the poore snakes so love their misery That they would see it by these threatning lights? Dare ye blaze still? Ile tosse up Buckets full Of Christians bloud to quench you: by those haires Drag you beneath the Center: there put out All your præsaging flames in Phlegeton! Can you outbrave me with your pidling Lights? Yawne earth with Casements as wide as hel it selfe! Here a Vault opens. Burne Heaven as ardent as the Lemnian flames! Wake (pale Tysiphon) spend all thy snakes! Be Eacus, and Minos as severe As if the Gaole delivery of us all Were the next Sessions! Ile pull Radamant By his flaming furres from out his Iron Chaire. Whilst he is in his fury, arise foure Fiends, framed like Turkish Kings, but blacke, his supposed Predecessors dance about him to a kind of hideous noyse, sing this Song, following. 1. Fiend. Horror dismall cryes, and yells Of these thy Grandsires thee fore-tells, Furies sent of thee to learne Crimes, which they could nere discerne. All. Furies sent, &amp;c. 2. Fiend. O Amurath! thy Father's come, To warne thee of a suddaine doome, Which in Cassanoe's fields attends To bring thee to thy Hellish friends. All. Which in Cassanoes, &amp;c. 3. Fiend. Megæra and Ennio both doe stand, Trembling, least when thou art damn'd Chiefe of Furies thou shouldst bee, And they their snakes resigne to thee. All. Chiefe of Furies, &amp;c. 4. Fiend. Terror we a while will leave thee, Till Cocytus Lake receive thee. Cerberus will quake for feare Where he a new Turkes fate shall heare. All. Cerberus will, &amp;c. Am. Now who the Divell sent my Grandsires hither? Had Pluto no taske else to set them too? He should have bound them to Jxions wheele, Or bid them roule the stone of Sysiphus: Beshrew me, but their singing did not please me! Have they not beene so drunke with Lethe yet As to forget me? Then can portend no ill For, should the fates be twining my last threed; Yet none durst come from Hell to tell me so! Shall I be scar'd with a Night-walking Ghost; Or what my working fancy shall present? Why, I can looke more terrible, then Night, And command darknesse in the unwilling day: Make Hecate start: and draw backe her head, To wrap it in a swarthy vaile of Clouds. Drop sheets of Sulphure, you prodigious skyes! Cyclops, run all thy Bullets into Ætna, Then vomit them at once! should Christians Couch to the bottomlesse abysse of Styxe, Or hide themselves under Avernaes shade, This mine arme should fetch them out! Day must performe What I intend, wrath raines a bloudy storme: And now 'gins rise the Sunne, which yet not knowes The misery it shall see on Amuraths Foes, Lords, Leaders, Captaines: Enter Schahin and others. Schah. Your Highnesse up so soone? Am. He small rest takes, That dreames on nought but bloudy broyles and death. Schah. Your Grace seemes much distempered: Beds of sweat Bedew your browes with never wonted palenesse. Am. Why; see you not? The heavens are turn'd Court Ladies, And put on other Haire besides their owne: Canst guesse (learn'd Schahin) what these flames portend? Schah. My Lord, such things as these we men must see, And wonder at, and yet not search the reason, Perchance unwholsome fogs exhailed by th'Sunne Are set a blazing by his too neere heate: But 'tis not lawfull that a mortall eye: Should dare to penetrate Heavens secrecy. Am. Doth it not bode a Conquest? Schah. Yes, 'gainst the Christians: For, unto them it bends sinister lookes, And frownes upon their army more then ours. Amur. So, so! come on, ere Phosphorus appeare Let's too't, and so prevent that sluggard Sol! If we want light, we'll from our Winnards Strike fire enough to scorch the Vniverse; Mine armour there! Some goe for his armour. Now (Mahomet) I implore Thy promist ayde for this auspitious day! Tosse me aloft, and make me ride on Clouds! If my horse faile me, those fire breathing jades, (Which the boy Phaethon knew not how to guide) Will I plucke out from out the flaming teame, And hurle my selfe against those condense Spheares, On which ile sit, and stay their turning Orbes; The whole vertigious Circle shall stand still, But to behold me: Mine armour ho! So helpe on here, now like Alcides do I girt my selfe, They bring his Armor. With well knit sinewes, able to stagger Earth, And threaten Nature with a second Chaos: If one impetuous broyle remaine to come In future ages, set on foote this houre! How well this weight of steele befits my strength? Me thinks the Gods stand quivering, and doe feare (When I am arm'd) another Phlegrae's neare! Chiron shall see his Pindus at my feet! And, ile climbe to Heaven, and pull it downe, And kicke the weighty burden of the world, From off the Babies shoulders that supports it! For I am safer Buckled 'gainst my foe. Then sturdy Iason who by the inchanted charmes Medea gave, incountred Vnicornes, Queld Lyons, struggeld with fiery belching Buls: Obtain'd a glorious prize, a Fleece, a Fleece Dipt deepe in tincture of the Christians bloud. Shall be my spoyle, nay should they hide their heads In their Gods bosome, here's a sword shall reach th?! Come they shall know no place is free from wrath, When boyling bloud is stirr'd in Amurath. Exeunt. An alarme, excursions: fight within. Enter at one doore a Christian, at another a Turke; fight, both kild: so a new charge, the Turkes kill most. Enter Lazarus, Schahin kils him. Enter Eurenoses, Cobelitz, they fight, Cobelitz faints, falls for dead. A showt within, a token of Victory on the Turkes side, a Retrait sounded. Scæna 4. Enter above Amurath, Bajazet, Nobles, to see the spoyle. Schah. Here (mighty Prince) take view of Victory, And see the field too narrow for thy spoyles! Erynnus hides her head as if afraid, To see a slaughter. She durst never hope for, Earth hath the Carkasses, and denies them Graves, And lets them be and rot, and fat her wombe, Scorning to be unto slaves a Tombe. Am. Where are become those ominous Comets now? What? are those pissing Candles quite extinct? Leave their disasterous snuffes no stench behind them? 'Tis something yet, that their God seeth their slaughter. Lending sulphurious Meteors to behold The blest destruction of these Parasites. I knew the Elements would first untye The Nerves of the Vniverse, then let me dye! Here Cobelitz riseth as awakt, amazed leaning on his Sword, stumbling ore the dead bodies, lookes towards Amurath. Euren. See (King) here's one worme yet that dare confesse He breaths and lives, which once this hand crusht downe. Amur. Ha, ha, by Mahomet and we are weary now: Some Mercy shall lay Victory asleepe. It will a Lawreat prove to this great strife, 'Mongst all these murdered to give one his life, So we'll discend. He goeth from aloft. Cob. From what a dismall grave am I awaked, Intombed within a Golgotha of men; Have all these Soules prevented me in blisse, And left me in a dreame of happinesse? But soft! me thoughts he sayd he would descend! Then, Heavens one minutes breath, that's all I aske, And then I shall performe my lifes true taske. Amurath descends on the Stage, Cobelitz staggers towards him. Am. Poore slave, wouldst live? Here Cobelitz is come to him, seeming to kneele, stabs him with a pocket Dagger. Cob. Yes Turke to see thee dye! Howle, howle, (grim Tartar) yell (thou gristly Wolfe) Force the bloud from out thy gaping Wound! Dij tibi non mortem, qua cunctis pæna paratur, Sed sensum post fata, tua dent (impie) morti. Amur. My spirit makes me not to feele thy weapon! Hold you (crackt Organs) of my shottered life, I am not toucht yet! can I not mocke my death, And thinke 'tis but a dreame tells me I am hurt? Dar'st thou then leave me (bloud?) Canst be so bold As to forsake these veynes to flow on Earth? And must, I like th'unhappy Roman, dye By a slaves hand? Cob. Tyrant, 'tis knowne He's Lord of others lifes that scornes his owne! Am. I that could scarce ere sleepe, can I ere die? And will none feare my life when I am dead Tortures and torments for the murderer! Cob. Ha, ha, ha! Leaning on his sword. I thanke the (great omnipotent) than I Shall ere laugh out the lag end of my life! Am. Villaine, thy laugh wounds worse then did thy Dagger! Are you Lethargick (Lords) in cruelty? Cob. Nay, heare me (Turke) now will I prompt their rage Locke me in the Bull of Phalaris, Cut off these eye-lids, bid me then out-gaze The parching Sun-beames; flea this tender skin, Set nests of Hornets on my rawest flesh, Let the Siconian Clouds drop brimstone on me, Powre boyling Lemnos on my greenest wounds, Put on my shoulder Nessus poysoned shirt, The Lord that holds up Amurath offers to touch his wounds. Bind all these bloudy faces to my face Rocke me Procrastes like— Am. Hell, oh! I cannot brooke your smallest touch, Cob. Ha, ha, each groane is Balsome to my wounds: I am perfect well! Bajazet offers to kill Cobelitz; a Nobleman holds his hand. Schah. Rascall dar'st deride us? Cob. Yea? and while your witty furies shall invent For me, some never heard of punishment; I see a guard of Saints ready to take me hence. Take then froe flight, my new rewarded soule, And seate thee on the winged Seraphims, Hast to the Empyreum, where thy welcome Shall be an Haleluia, anthem'd forth By the Chorus of the Angell-Hierarchy. Pierce with (swift plumes) the concave paths oth' Moone Where the black ayre enlightened is with starres. Stay not to wonder (there) of wandring Signes At the inhorn'd Gemini, or Amphions Harpe, At Arctos, or Bootes, or the Beare, (Which are to please wizard Astrologers) Soare higher with the pitch and then looke downe To laugh at the hard trifles of the world! Perchance some oft have knowne a better life, Never did none ere leave it more willingly. Am. Feare your deaths (Gods) for I have lost my life, And what I most (complaine) my tyranny! Cob. Soule to detaine thee from thy wished rest Were but an envious part! arise, farewell: To stay thee to accuse or fate or man Would shew I were unwilling yet to leave thee But deare companion hence: cut through the ayre: Let not the grosenesse of my Earth ore-lime Thy speedy wings, fly without weight of crime. He dyes. Am. O now have I and Fortune tryed it out. With all her best of favours was I crown'd And suffred her worst threats, wh? most she frown'd. Stay (Soule!) a King, a Turke, commands thee stay! Sure I am but an actor, and must strive To personate the Tragicke ends of Kings. And so (to winne applause unto the Scæne) With fained passion thus must graspe at death! O but I see pale Nemesis at hand: Art thou dull fate, and dost not overspread Gimmerion wings of death throughout the world; What? Not one Earthquake? One blazing Comet T'accompany my soule t'his Funerall? Is not this houre the generall period To nere returning time? Last breath command A new Dewcalions deluge, that with me The world may swim to his Eternall Grave, Cracke hindge that holds this globe, and welcome death, Wilt thou not stay Soule? Friend not stay with Kings? Sinke then, and sinke beneath the Thracian Mount. Sinke beneath Athos, be the Blackish Waves Of Acheron thy Tombe, ile want a Grave; So all parts feare, which first my Corps shall have; For in my Grave, ile be the Christians foe. Here like a Massie Pyramide ile fall, Ile strive to sinke all the whole fabricke with me, Quake Pluto, for 'tis I that come A Turke, a Tyrant, and a Conquerour, And with this groane, like thunder will I cleave, The timerous earth, whilst thus my last I breath. He dyes. Baiaz. O easie powers, to give's all at first, But in their losse they make us most accurst. Here all the Nobles kneele to Bajazet. Schah. The Taper of your Fathers life is spent We must have light still and adore a Sunne That next is rising, therefore mighty Prince, Vpon your shoulders must the load Of Empire rest. Baiaz. Why (Lords) we have a Brother Who, as in the same bloud he tocke a share, So let him beare his part in Government: Sch. My Lord! within the selfe-same Hemispheare It's most prodigious when two Sunnes appeare! One body by one soule must be inform'd. Kingdomes like (marriage beds) must not indure Any corrivall! Rome was nere secure Whilst she contain'd a Pompey, and a Cæsar. Like as one Prophet we acknowledge now So of one King in state we must allow. You know the Turkish Lawes, Prince be not nice To purchase Kingdomes, whatsoever the price. He must be lopt, send for him he must dye. Baiaz. O happy Baiazet that he was borne To be a King when thou was Counseller. Call in our Brother Jacup, Some goes for him. Here sixe men take vp Amuraths Trunke on their shoulders. Baj. Why (Lords!) is Amurath so light a weight? Is this the Truncke oth' Turkish Emperor? Oh what a heape of thoughts are come to naught What a light weight is he unto sixe men Who durst stand under Ossa, and sustaine it: Euren. My Lord, these Meditations fit not you: You are to take the honour he hath left, And thinke you of his rising, not his fall! Enter Iacup. Let your decree be suddaine, heere's your Brother. Baj. Brother, I could have wished we might have met At times of better greeting! Our father hath Bequeath'd to the Grave these ashes, to us his State. Nor have we leysure (yet) to mourne for him Brother, you know our state hath made a Law, That, he that sits in a Majesticke Chayre, Must not endure the next succeeding heyre. Jac. Yes, we doe: And (Brother) doe you thinke 'tis crime enough To dye, because I am sonne to an Emperour? Scah. My Lord, we know their breathes in him that ayre Of true affection, that he doth much desire You should be equall in his Kingdome with him: But still when two great evils are propos'd: The lesse is to be chosen. Euren. My Lord, your life's but one: Kings are the threads whereto there are inweaved Millions of lives, and he that must rule all Must still be one that is select from all. Although we speake, yet thinke them not our words, But what the Land speakes in us! Kings are free: And must be impatient of equality. Jat. And is't ene so? How have these Dogs fawn'd on me lickt my feet When Amurath yet lived? Felt all my thoughts, And soothed them to the sight of Empyrie. And now the first would set their politique hands To strangle up that breath, a blast of which Their nosthrils have suckt up like perfum'd ayre Well brother well by all men this is spoke, That heart that cannot bow, may yet be broke. Baiaz. Brother you must not now stand to upbraid; They which doe feare the vulgars murmuring tongue, Must also feare th'authority of a King For rulers must esteeme it happinesse That with their government they can hate suppresse: They with too faint a hand the Scepters sway, Who regard love, or what the people say: To Kindred we must quite put off respect, When 'tis so neare it may our Crowne affect. Jac. Then name of Brother doe I thus shake off, For 'tis in vaine, their mercy to implore When impious Scatists have decreed before. Yet King although thou take my life away See how Ile dye in better state then thou! Who like (my Father) after his greatest glory May fall by some base hand: The Minister To take my breath, shall be to thy selfe, a King. Here Iacup takes a Scarfe from his Arme, and putting it about his necke gives one end to Bajazet. Yet give me leave a while to Prophesie, You that so Puppet-like delude your hopes, And Miser-draw the ancestry from Kings, Thinking, that fates dare not approach your bloud Till they doe seize you, then you leave this Earth Not as you went, but by compulsion dragg'd; Still begging for a morrow from your Grave, And with such shifts you doe deceive your selves: As if you could deceive mortality, No (Brother King) nor all the Glow-worme state, Which makes thee be a Horse-leach for thy bloud, Not all the Parasites Minions thou maintaines. Nor the restorative Dishes that are found out. Nor all thy shifts and trickes can cheat mortality, Or keepe thee from a death that's worse then mine. Should all this faile, age would professe it selfe A slow, but a sure Executioner. O 'tis a hard thing well to temperate Decaying happinesse in great estate But this example by me may you gaine: That at my death I not of Heaven complaine Pull then, and with my fall pull on thy selfe Mountaines of burdenous honor which shall curse thee Death leades the willing by the hand But spurs them headlong on, that dares command. Here himselfe pulls one end Bajazet the other, Iacup dyes. Bajazet. Take up this Trunke; and let us first appoint Our Fathers and our Brothers Funerals, The sencelesse body of that Caitiffe slave, Hurle to a Ditch, Posterity shall heare Our lesse ill Chronicled, but time shall heare These minutes rather, then repeate their woe. Now Primacy, on thee ile meditate, Which who enjoy thee, are in blest estate. Whose age in secure silence fleets away, Without disturbance to his funerall day; Nor ponderous nor unquiet honours can Vexe him but dyes a primate ancient man, What greater powers threaten inferiour men A greater power threatens him agen: And like to wasted Tapers Kings must spend Their lives to light up others: So all end. Exeunt bearing out solemnly the bodies of Amurath and Iacup. FINIS.</field>
