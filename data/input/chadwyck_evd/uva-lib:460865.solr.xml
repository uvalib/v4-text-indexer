      <field name="fulltext">THE SIEGE OF BRADFORD; WITH NOTES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Earl of Newcastle, King's General. Lord Newport. Sir John Goodricke. Sir Thomas Fairfax. Captain Lister. Atkinson. Priest. Miser. Robber. Lady Fairfax. Mary, Servant at Bowling-Hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âBowling Camp. Enter Newcastle, Newport, Goodricke, &amp;c. Newcastle. Now scornfully rejected are our terms, And the mad rabble, with unthinking souls, Scorn all authority, and, in contempt, Trample the crown and sceptre in the dust, And o'er the broken fragments triumph. Shall we, who represent the sacred form Of heav'n's anointed, suffer such an insult? And tamely too, my lord? Newport. Never, my lord: Sooner shall ev'ry town dissolve in smoke, Than e'er a single gem of Britain's crown Is touch'd by rebel hands! Our ocean-circled throne, 'Gainst foreign foes, like the unshaken atlas, Still unmov'd, secure as granite rocks, By mortals ne'er approach'd, has ages stoodâ And shall those envious sharks, those shrimps in arms, Swim thro' the ocean of our loyal blood? No, neverâtill our counsellors are fools, Our soldiers cowards, and our king a slave! Newcastle. From wary ambush, with impetuous rage, Let them like furies rush upon our men. Their wives and children urge them to the fight, And make the music which inspires their souls. Our cannon thundering shall defeat them all, And send the orbed messengers of death Against the church, which most they will defend. Goodricke. There's no disbanded soldier in the town But is an officer to train the rest. Firm resolution sits on ev'ry brow, And scarce a man amongst them is unarm'd. From the surrounding villages they come, Nor think that rustic weapons soon will fail. Meanwhile the town's-men, with exulting shouts, Welcome them all, and spur them on to conquest. Newcastle. Fairfax will lead them.âTell that to our troops. There's not a private soldier in our ranks Who will not, when he hears the news, cry outâ Lead us on, gen'ral, to our monarch's foe! High in the air will toss their glitt'ring arms, And, as they form their ranks, shoutâVictory! The horses of our cavalry will prance As if they heard the trumpets of the foe; Make the firm pavement dance beneath their feet, Impatient to begin the work of glory. [Exeunt. Scene II. âCouncil Chamber in Bradford. Fairfax, Lister, &amp;c. &amp;c. Fairfax. Now is the town surroundedânot with walls, But by our furious and victorious foes. No passage for retreatâno strongbuilt towersâ No batteryâno amunition; but The fire of liberty still burns, unquench'd, With fervent glow, in ev'ry hero's breast. On one side stands the ruin of your all, But, on the other, certain victory. I come, to aid you in a glorious cause. 'Tis not to gain renown I thus am arm'd; What is my armour?â'tis but civil war; From England be it, yes, from England far. I come not here for that frail bubble, fame; I see no wreath of laurel in the air. What tempts me thus to meet the shining swords Of brother Britons, in this dreadful war, Which sullies England with ten thousand stains, And makes the envious nations all rejoice,â I come to gain our liberties and rights. Priest. Should I advise, and my weak words be heard, You'll not appear in arms, to aid a cause That wants the seal of heav'n to make it good. What state e'er flourish'd that despis'd its king? What monarch suffer'd, but the royal blood Was pour'd in vengeance on the guilty land? For they who hate their King must hate their God; Insulting Heav'n by slighting its vicegerent. And tho' the royal Charles has his faults, When Heav'n sees good, without our puny aid, 'Twill mend him, or remove him from the throne. Lister. Shall we, who glow with rage to gain our rights, Be turn'd to cowards by a zealot's words? Must we endure the galling iron yoke Of meanest slavery, and our necks in mire, While pontiff pride, and monarchy's proud crest Nod us to silence like a child in fear? Shall we, whose fathers, in the foreign wars Would never fight but in the foremost ranks, Basely submit to tyrants,âwhile our force, Link'd up by valour like a chain of steel, Would pierce an army like a misty cloud? Champing their bits the steeds of Britons are, And none can meet our poverty in war. Priest. Let wisdom guide ye.âLet us view the fate Of other towns that fight against the throne.â Judge well your strength, and what your store of arms. Your men, unskilful in the bloody strife, One half would rush in passion on the foe, And, in their headstrong rage, would miss their aim; The rest in fear would throw away their arms, And leave the bleeding bodies of their friends. Fairfax. Is this the opinion that you entertain? Are all men cowards 'cause you think them so? Nayâhere are men whose breasts are void of fear, Who thirst for victory, and who burn with rage. Could they stand tamely by, and see their church, And its once-lofty venerable tow'r, Lie level with the tombstones of the dead? Think of the martyrs, that in fiery death Gave God the gloryâsee them clap their hands, While blazing faggots wafted them to heav'n! Shall yon most sacred edifice of yours Be laid in ruins, while we fly in fear? Methinks the ghosts of your forefathers cryâ Defend your church, or at her altar die! Lister. Defend your church! yes, that's the word which fires My burning bosom with heroic rage. All things of earth are as a feather light, When in the balance with a mount of lead. Shall we, then, fly, while murd'ring balls of fire, Like engines ef destruction, level all The sacred edifice, and bury deep The glorious pile where piety resides? Priest. Alas! how many mortals thirst for fame! Their eye-balls, made of pride, see nothing else But their own interest; whose blood-thirsty souls, Dead to remorse and pity, grasp renown In the swoln streams of kindred blood. Religion, law, authority, despis'd, By haughty beings, desperately bent, Deep shaded in this dark tremendous night Of dread intestine horrors, which are cast On this once-smiling, peaceful, happy isle. Fools wish for crowns, and cowards for renown; The profligate for wealth, the base for gold; The ignorant for rule, the vile for praise: Thus, various kinds of poor deluded souls, With envious eyes behold their monarch's throne, And thirst to stain it with a country's blood. When the dark cheeks of heav'n shall blush, And all yon star-deck'd arch shall frown in fire, Know, ye rebellious chiefs, I clear'd my soul, And warn'd you, ere your swords were dy'd in blood. But if you still persist, reflect on thisâ Behold the horrors of this dreadful war! See fathers, sons, and kinsmen yield their blood; See mothers weeping o'er their orphans, slain; Your virgins ravish'd, and your town in flames! Fairfax. Engage we must: and here is not the place For priests to interfereâtheir duty's prayer. Therefore, away! heroic souls, away! Priest never fight, 'tis we must win the day. Priest. Then take your course.âIf words have no effect With murd'ring swords, throw blood against the stars, And on the azure face of heav'n write death. I'll say no more; but, with my latest breath, CryâBless my country, and protect its throne. Exit. Fairfax. Now, gentlemen, give ear unto my words: The little time that fate allows for peace, Must be employ'd in active preparation, Around the tow'r let wool-packs now be hung, To shield the pile from the impending danger. Let all your club-men practise well their arts, That, when the strife begins, they may be firm. Take careful note no spy invades the town, To carry back our secrets to the foe. Let ev'ry man exert his utmost pow'r To save the cause which he has vow'd to aid. Now we'll disperse,âand should we meet again, 'Twill be with glory and eternal fame. Exeunt. Scene III. âHall. Enter Lady Fairfax. Lady Fairfax. These jarring sounds of warlike preparation Are now become familiar to mine ear, And, on my woman's cheekâth'effect of fearâ No longer is the lily's whiteness seen. Yet, for my lord, my mind is anxious still, Tho' reckless of myself.âOh, Fairfax, Fairfax! When will the day arrive, when, free from war, Thy wife shall clasp thee to her tender heart, And talk of perils and disasters past? Enter Fairfax. How fares my lady? I had news to tell Which would have made thy bosom much exult. I was commanded, on the instant, hence. The Parliament insisted I should quit The town of Bradford for another post. But much I fear the town's-men will regret The absence of my well-tried valiant men. Lady Fairfax. Alas, my lord! in thee they lose their shield. Where Fairfax in the bloody battle moves, Danger and fear must vanish from his face; Courage and valour circle him around, And victory sit smiling on his plume. Fairfax. Sweet flatterer, forbear! I cannot stay To hear these praises from a consort's lips. Danger and peril, greater than we leave, Must meet us yet, before we find a time To deal in compliments and courtly phrase. Lady Fairfax. My noble husband! I respect thy thoughts, And feel the justice of thy sage reproof. Think not a woman cannot feel the fire That constant burns within a glorious breast; Oh yes, she canâand tho' her body's form'd Of weaker matter and more gentle mould, Yet, still, her soul can emulate the copy Which daring manhood sets before her sight. Fairfax. If Fairfax has a claim to praise and glory, Thou, lovely lady, art the pristine cause.â Thy virtue holds the lesson to my eye, And, not to copy, were to sink in shame. Oh, England!âtorn with civil, bloody strife, When shall the sun of peace again shine o'er thee? When shall thy children meet with brothers' love, And cease to grasp their murd'ring instruments? When will the day arrive, when pipe and lute Shall take the place of trumpet and of drum? Hot fall the bolt on his accursed head, Who would imbrue his hand in native gore! Heav'n, stretch thy curse, e'en to the utmost limit, Upon the wretch, who, lost to fellow-feeling, Would kindle discord on his native shores! Enter Lister. Lister. My lord, I bring you word, that Newport's son, Led on too far by his impetuous spirit, Became entangled by our trusty friends: He saw his danger,âcall'd aloud for quarter.â âI'll give thee Bradford quarter,â said a wretch, And, on the instant, stabb'd him to the heart. Fairfax. Lister! my blood is frozen in my veins, To think a deed so villainous is done. Henceforth your town is stain'd with guiltless blood. Was't not enough that he confess'd his conquest, But must you, when he ask'd a soldier's right, Withhold that boon? Remember, gallant friend, While we are foes we still are countrymen: And, shall an Englishman deny his brother What would be granted from a foreign foe? Lister. My lord, the act did meet my stern reproof; Therefore, this blame attaches not to me. Your soldiers wait for you to lead them hence, Under the cover of this gloomy night: For, should the enemy suspect your plans, It were in vain to venture forth at all. Fairfax. Why then, we'll onâand speed us with your pray'rs. Bradford, adieu!âagain, in happier time, I hope to see thee, arm'd with strength and pow'r, By civil broils untorn. Lister, farewell! Urge my instructions to our steady friends. If Providence should smile upon their arms, Let mercy and thanksgiving follow it. Never can mortals think to pay the debt They owe their Maker; but a virtuous soul Will ever glory to acknowledge it. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âBowling Camp. Enter Newcastle and Newport. Newcastle. My noble friend! let me express my praise At viewing fortitude so great as thine.â An only son, torn from a doting sire, And perishing, by vile and trait'rous means, Might well call forth a flood of manly tears. Newport. Think'st thou, my friend, that Newport e'er can weep At sorrow like the present? No, never, never! My heart is swelling and my brain's on fire; But tears refuse to help me in distress. A trifling cause may make a hero weep; A greater one may drive his reason mad. Newcastle. I feel thy pangsâand only wish'd to call The drops of nature in to thy assistance; But since my wishes are in vain applied To rouse the father, let me rouse the man:â Thinkâshall we wait, and tardily neglect The means of vengeance, when within our pow'r? Newport. Never, my friend! Let us not lose a second. Oh, that I could, like a red ball of fire, Dash thro' the midst of this relentless band, And, dealing fierce destruction all around, Call forth the spirit of my murder'd son; Make it confess I had reveng'd its wrongs, Then see it rise to everlasting peace! Newcastle. Early to-morrow we attack the town, And, doubtless, it will make a brave defence: Reserve your noble fire for that occasion, Then let it burst in desolating fury. Newport. Behold what gath'ring clouds obscure the town, As if in mourning for th'approaching scene! Hark! how the wind begins to howl and sigh, As if destruction rode upon the blast! And look! from yonder dark not distant cloud, What wand'ring night birds wing their dreary flight! Hark! how they shriek!âpresaging the approach Of wild destruction and tempestuous fight. [Thunder and Lightning. Now, to complete the scene, the vivid flash Streaks the black sky in forms of hideous shape!â Methinks I read in letters writ in fire, âBradford, thy measure of despair is full!â [Bell tolls. How solemnly the deep-ton'd midnight bell Gives warning of the flitting hours of sleep! Sleep, did I say?âAlas! where is the man, Aware of what will happen on the morrow, Can close his eyes, forgetful of its horrors? Newcastle. Until fierce discord from our land is driv'n, No terrors e'er should shake a soldier's heart; Compos'd in war, serene upon the field, Encircled round with slaughter, he should stand, And brave ten thousand dangers, undismay'd. And now for one short hour retire to rest; And let the orders to the army be, That in the conflict they will save the church: For never let the arm of war be rais'd To strike the mansion of the Deity. Bid all our soldiers be in readiness; Unfurl the royal banners of our king; Charge with a shout upon proud Cromwell's host, And let our cannon be the only music. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Thicket. Enter a Robber, who conceals himself. Enter a Miser, with a spade and bags of gold. Miser. Where shall I hide these troublers of my rest? For fifty years, my constant care has been To swell my stores,âand now they're like to vanish. Hark! who was that? Alack, 'twas but the tree, That mov'd its leaves obedient to the wind. Some folks there are, would part with all this gold, But to be certain of a twelve-months' life; I care not for the grave, so I be laid Where my heart's treasure underneath is hid. These golden pieces are my drops of blood; I would not part with one to keep from death. [A Shout. Oh! mercy on me, what a shout was there! Should Cromwell's General just see my treasure, He'd rob me and pay off his drunken troops. The very thought on't makes me frantic. Robber (suddenly appearing from behind a bush firing a pistol.) Ah, ah! I'll ease thee of thy golden god, This arm and pistol soon can make thee poor. Old man, thy money!âGive it quickly up, Or meet thy death and never hoard again. Miser. Oh, monster! what a sin is robbery! My life I care not for; but this, my gold, Would sink thy soul, and make thee food for death. Robber. Quick, quick! deliver!âNay, then thus I snatch it. [Takes his money. Miser. Holdâyet a momentâgive me instant death, Since thou hast robb'd me of my very soul; Do not withhold the kindness of thine aid, But let thy pistol finish me at once. Robber. Tho' I have robb'd, I will not murder thee: There is the weapon, do the deed thyself. [Gives him the pistol. Miser. Ah, caitiff! villain! give me back my goldâ Giveâgive it back!âor I will fire at thee, Robber. Lend me the pistol, and I'll load it for thee Farewell, old miser, and go heap up more. [Exit. Miser, Nay, then, all's lost!âWill no one take my life? My life is gone.âWill no one stop my breath? Gold was my god, so give me instant death. [Exit. Scene III. âServants' Hall, Bowling. Soldiers of Newcastle drinking, singing, &amp;c., their arms placed on the table; part of the band playing. Enter a Bard, who sings. Britons' blood shall ne'er be spilt, Without horror, without guilt; Brothers yet will rue the day, That these met in bloody fray. Foes we have across the sea; Let us live in amity; From our land be discord far, Scatter'd those that wish for war. Why should here our bolts be hurl'd; Britons, join'd, can fight the world: Britain conquers all she meets, Shakes their thrones and sinks their fleets. Yes, she needs not others' aid, All the globe of her's afraid;â Therefore, Britons be again, Firmly fix'd in friendship's chain! Yet, bring haughty Cromwell down, Face his guns, and scorn his frown; Then again your Bard will singâ Tyrants fall, âGod save the King.â Scene IV. âThe great Hall. Newcastle and all his Officers, in council. Newcastle. My gallant comrades, now I shrink, I dread, To see my countrymen destroy'd and dead; Upon a foreign shore I there could fight, And conquest then would be my great delight;â But look this day, how many left behind, For mothers, daughters, and for wives to find; I almost hear the curses and the sighs, Which from the moor of Adwalton will rise: The greatest victory but in sorrow ends, When that is purchas'd by the life of friends. Newport. Death and destruction in my bosom dwell, My son is slain, by traitor's hands he fell. Could I but find the wretch that slew my son, Arm'd or unarm'd, against him would I run, Revenge has made me like a ball of fire, You have no sons, you never was a sire, Else would your thunder, and your glitt'ring steel, Make every heart of yon proud rebels reel. Give me one troop of horse 'tis all I want, The monarch's banner on yon tow'r I'll plant; Death I will seek, and face each loaded gun, Or be reveng'd,âthey slew my son, my son! Newcastle. Then injur'd Newport, take Sir Goodricke's troop, Till morning that firm resolution keep; But these long-waking eyes must rest in sleep, Now is the third long day and days of fight, I feel I'm forc'd to try to rest to-night; Let guards be plac'd around, and sober be, In the beginning of the civil war men were impatient of duty, and were often asleep in the houses when they should have been on guard. That I may wake to certain victory. Scene V. âA chamber in Bowling-Hall. Enter a female, attended by ladies and several servants. Mary. I dare do it. First Lady. You will be slain or taken. Mary. I'll terrify him from his purpose. First Lady. Heroic maid! if you can change his heart, Your's is my gold before I hence depart. Second Lady. Hark! they are drunk: let them fight away, Make pale thy face; for thy success I pray. Mary. Robe me aright; now hit my face again, Till whiter than death's paleness, I remain. First Servant. I'll fetch some flour. Second Lady. Do not smile nor joke. [They dust her face with flour. First Lady. Now drink this cordial just to nerve thy frame, Thy point once gain'd, is everlasting fame. Mary. We have one part of the oak ceiling loos'd, That I can enter safely unperceiv'd; Scarce in these terrors I refrain from mirth, My voice must be as if 'twas not from earth: Can I persuade him Bradford town to spare, My point is gain'd, and that is all my care. Now see the light, behold the tyrant's come, Retireâyour feet be still, your tongues be dumb. [Exeunt. Scene VI. âMary, solus. Firm resolution, come unto my aid, Support my spirits, make me not afraid; Bring such a terror to the tyrant's breast, Spirit of fear!âthat shall destroy his rest; Unnerve his arm, and sink the tyrant's heart, That fear may make him tremble and depart! Scene VII. âThe bed-room of Newcastle, in Bowling Hall. A taper burning. Newcastle. âSolus. How happy, in his thraldom, is the slave, Who, on his bed of straw, can lose all care. While slumber, calm and tranquil shut his eyes, And honest labour rocks him to repose.â The soldier, too, who, stretch'd upon the earth, Beneath his canvass canopy, secure, Upon his armour rests his careless head, Nor drops a tear o'er dearest comrades slain,â But, like the sentinel, at this dread hour, I hear the constant pendulum of time Measure the moments of the awful night, Which soon will change into a day of death. O, Newport!âloyal, brave, heroic youth! Methinks I see him stretch'd upon the earth; His brow, undaunted, shaded by his helm, In death, still like his soul, seems undismay'd. Oh! when to-morrow's deadly strife begins, And carnage thickens on the reeking field, How will the thought of much-lov'd Newport's death, Inspire our vet'ran troops, and nerve each arm, While all the welkin echoes with revenge! Come, morning, come,âwhen into conq'ring lines The trumpet's piercing sound shall rouse us all! But, hark! what more than earthly voice Assails mine ear, and with its awful tone Shakes my firm breast, which danger never mov'd! Enter MARY as a ghost. What do I see?âIs this the illusion of a mind Fretted and clouded with the heavy cares That press upon me?âor art thouâspeak! [MARY approaches nearer. Art thou to me a friendly messenger From the bright world of purity and peace? Whate'er thou art, I charge thee, speak! MARY. Intent to melt thy adamantine soulâ Abate thy veng'ful ardour, and destroy Thy horrid purposes of dire revenge. I charge thee to relent!âChangeâO change Thy sanguine resolution! lest, whene'er Thou seek'st for mercy at the throne of heaven, Thy pray'r be spurn'd, and exil'd from the scenes Of bliss on high, perdition be thy lot. âPity poor Bradford! and poor Bradford spare!â [Mary, smiling, retires. Newcastle. How suddenly 'tis vanish'd!âand at once My mind's unnerv'dâmy fortitude is gone! O that some mortal would approach, and hear The cause of all this horror and dismay! Enter Newport, in complete armour. Newport. I will not sleep;âthis steel-cas'd head of mine Shall press no pillow; but my sword shall shine, Faintly reflecting Cynthia's borrow'd light;â The spirit of my son, haunts me to-night. Would great Newcastle from his dreams awake, The town should tremble, and yon tow'r should shake. Newcastle. Newport, my friend! An awful form in an unearthly garb, Hath lately left me; and, while present, Charg'd me, by the dread secrets of eternity, To pity the devoted town of Bradford. See, Newport, how I shake with fear! my limbs Totter beneath their weightâand yet I cannotâ Upon my soul, I cannot think to spare Such cruel rebels.âWhat shall we do, my friend? Shall we retreat, and leave the town in arms, Or, by a fierce attack, compel it to surrender? Newport. Must it be saidâtwo gen'rals, royalists, Have left a town unconquer'd, 'cause a thing, Which some will deem a stratagem, appear'd? Let us away, and walk thro' all the camp, To cheer our men!âLet no one know the fear And terror which have seiz'd their leaders here. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âA street in Bradford. Enter Lister and soldiers. Lister. Lords, gentlemen, and honourable friends! The day's arriv'd, after repeated trials, That stamps the rise or ruin of your town. Upon ourselves we now must place our trust: For Fairfax, and his soldiers, all are gone. If you be firm, and value liberty, Enough of strength is left to see us conquer. Enter Atkinson. Wherefore dost thou, ferocious murderer, Appear, to taint our virtue with thy presence? Hence!âand in solitude repent thy crime. Atkinson. And is it possible a deed of valour Can call such language from heroic Lister? Was not the blow that brought young Newport down, A stroke that aim'd to stab at slavery? Lister. And canst thou glory in the cruel deed? Art thou so lost to feeling and remorseâ Art thou so dead to shame, as not to know That cruelty degrades the warrior's name, And murder turns his laurels into snakes?â Hateful he standsâhis memory abhorr'd, Detested by his brother as his foe. Atkinson. Again I boast young Newport fell by me; Again, if he were here, I'd strike him down; And make the sons of freedom boldly own I'd done a deed that merited their love! Lister. Is reason and humanity within thee So totally extinct, as not to comprehend The act was foreign to our glorious aim? How can we hope to wear the palm of conquest, If cruelty must its proceedings stain? Atkinson. My creed isâblood for blood! I saw my friend Fall to the earth beneath his infant arm: Reason was lull'd to rest, and vengeance reign'd. Lister. When thine own conscience speaks with awful voice, In bitter language, fraught with horror, Think, then, that Lister us'd his utmost pow'r To make thy bosom sensible of crime. [Cannon fires. Now to your postsâthe work of death begins. Station our fairest marksmen in the steeple, While we proceed the enemy to meet, And lay them lifeless in our native street. Remember, sirs, your country is at stake, And every man must try to win the game. [A shout. Hark! we are call'd.âNow boldly all advance, And work your safety in the fall of foes, Think who have been the cause of all these woes. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA grove. Enter Newcastle and Newport. Newport. The fortune of the day as yet is doubtful. We cannot longer dare to save the church: For, in the steeple, men of the greatest skill Their muskets level, with destructive fire. Newcastle. The artillery now begin to play, And shouts of triumph swell the giddy breeze; Danger and glory animate the men On either side, and slaughter is begun! Newport. Distraction!âsee!âour troops begin to fly; Mark! how the rebels drive them from their posts! And, lo! what deadly havoc they have made In yon battalion on the western side! See! now the cannon dare not keep a fire, Lest they destroy their friends as well as foes. Newcastle. Again the fortune of the day seems ours: For, see! a cannon-ball has struck the cords That held the sheets of wool against the church. Now, now, they shout! confusion has begun, And our brave men regain their wonted spirit! Newport. Now is the time our presence is required: So shall advantage gain a double strength, And Victory be forc'd to drop her wreath Upon the brows of royalty. Enter an Officer. Officer. A general panic now has seiz'd our men, And fifty of the foe before them drive The troops of Colonel Goring! Newcastle. Let every trumpet tell the echoing air, That it may hiss upon their cowardice! What! do the rebels put our troops to flight? By heav'n, it seemsânay isâa miracle. What! can the peasants, with their knotted clubs, O'ercome a thousand of our army's flower? It cannot be,âmy soul denies belief, And mine own eyes must tell me of the truth. Newport. 'Tis false, 'tis false!âbehold, the rebels fly! See Goring, mounted on his sable steed, Resistless, cuts his way, like fiery Mars, Thro' the infatuated files of treason! Our men expect usâlet us both away, And, by a bold example, win the day! [Exeunt. Scene III. âThe Talbot Inn, in Bradford. Enter a Bard, who singsâ Hearken the guns! the bells the wrong way ring, During the time of the civil war they rung the bells from tenor to treble, in case of any alarm. Down fall the banners, hark! the soldiers singâ See, from the steeple, how the muskets flash, Hark! how the pikes against their armour clash. The club-men bend the barrels of the guns, From right to left the deadly conflict runs. Again, behold yon rapid well-aim'd ball Has struck the cords, and now the wool sheets fall. The murderer's fall'nânow Atkinson is deadâ Newport has found him, and he would have fled, But 'twas in vainâhe was to earth transfix'd, His blood was with the running waters mix'd. Now hand to hand the raging leaders fight, Preston has yielded unto Newport's might. Bingley's brave youths like lions stand the fray, And twice have turn'd the fortunes of the day. Firm fighters are the sons of Halifax, In one strong line they combat backs to backs. Lister rides boldly with his naked sword, Mix'd with his men he boldly gives the word: A thousand dangers he this day has brav'd, His only wish the church may yet be sav'd. All the dread horrors of contending fight, Have been since morning first awoke to light. In every house has ruin put her seal, The soldiers plunder, murder, rob, and steal: Ruin has stamp'd with terror every street, And heav'n's rich blessings lie beneath their feet. Death has rode boldly on his sable car, And crush'd his victims in this civil war. All villains are let loose, their harvest now, Order destroy'dâauthority laid low; And anarchy flies on her raven wings, To revolution, and the death of kings. Scene IV. âTown of Bradford.âGuns firing, and alarum bells ringing. Enter Lister. Lister. My lord of Newcastle, the day is yours. Into your hands I now give up my sword; And hope you'll grant a pardon to the brave, O'er whom you've gain'd no shameful victory. Their prowess and their valour gild the wreath Bestow'd on you, by Fortune, in her favour.â They were your foes before you conquer'd them; Be generous now, and make them all your friends. Newcastle. Rest ye secure.âI will not so disgrace The victory that heaven has bestow'd, As to perform an act that would emblot And stain the page of future history. Enter Lady Fairfax, guarded. The lady Fairfax, tooâand in my power! Lady Fairfax. My lord! a suppliant at your feet, I crave Your mercy.âI know that if I flatter So great a soul as your's, 'twill give offence, Far from relieving, only blast my hopes: But I may plead.âYou have a wife, and know What 'tis to love her with a zealous care, I need not make appeal more pow'rful, To work the purpose of my anxious heart. Behold! the consort of great Fairfax sues For what her husband never could deny, If your far dearer half were in his pow'r, At once, I know, he'd grant her liberty. Newcastle. That which you ask is freely granted: For never shall I keep a lady prisoner. When you are ready to depart, my guards, My carriage, horses, all are at your service. Lady Fairfax. Most generous lord, receive my heart-felt thanks! I hope the time will quickly come to all, Which all desireâa time of glorious peace. And may you with lord Fairfax never meet, Till civil broils are ended in the land. [Exit. Newcastle. Justice has done her work, and Mercy now Lifts up the veil that late obscur'd her brow. Far be the hour when treason shall again Erect its standard among Yorkshire men. Methinks I see its Trade and Commerce shine, Spreading its name to every distant clime; Its children blest with industry and health, The certain source of independent wealth. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTES. Note 1. In the year 1642, a body of troops, in the king's service, were quartered at Bradford, intended to suppress any revolt of the people that might have occurred; but it appears, that no disturbance happening, they were ordered to quit Bradford for some other place. During the absence of this military force, the inhabitants vigorously prepared for the defence of their town; blocked up every avenue leading to it, and sent out spies, to watch the motions of the Royalists, a party of whom lay at Leeds, who, hearing of the designs of the inhabitants of Bradford, dispatched a considerable number of troops to the latter place. They encamped on that part of the common called Undercliffe, and prepared to storm the town, which they did with great vigour, but were beaten off by the inhabitants, who had previously armed themselves with such weapons as the emergency of their situation would allow them time to make and procure. The Earl of Newcastle says General Fairfax now lay betwixt us and our friends in the West-Riding; but, to assist and encourage them, I was sent with about three hundred foot, three troops of horse, and some arms to Bradford. I was to march by way of Ferrybridge; but, on better intelligence how the enemy lay, with the same number as before, I marched in the night by several towns where they lay, and came the next day to Bradford, a town very untenable; but for their good affection to us, deserving all we could hazard for them. Our first work, then, was to fortify ourselves; for we could not but expect an assault. There lay at Leeds, one thousand five hundred of the enemy, and twelve hundred at Wakefield; neither place above six or seven miles distant from us. They visited us every day with their horse, ours not going far from the town, being very unequal in number; yet the enemy seldom returned without loss, till at last, our few men grew so bold, and theirs so disheartened, that they durst not stir a mile from their garrisons. On the 18th. of December, in the above year, it seems, however, that another visit to the town of Bradford was made by a royal party from Leeds, where the Earl of Newcastle then was. This body was commanded by Colonel Goring, Sir William Saville, Capt. Lister, and Capt. Nowel of Meakley. Their first object appears to have been the church, which was the fortress of the town. But, in this second attempt, the Royalists were again repulsed, and obliged to retire to Leeds, and soon after Fairfax took possession of the town in person. Newcastle's quarters seem now to have been removed to Wakefield, in the direction of which Fairfax marched out, and offered him battle. This brought on the action of Adwalton Moor, in which, both Fairfaxes, father and son, were totally routed. The old lord fled to Bradford, Sir Thomas took the road of Halifax, but finding the way open, returned on the day following with the remains of his division to Bradford, when Newcastle, whose head-quarters were at Bowling-Hall, prepared to besiege them in form. It was about this crisis of affairs, that Newcastle is supposed to have made the speech which commences The Siege of Bradford. Note 2. As a piece of architecture the tower of Bradford church appears the strongest and best built of any in the West-Riding; and the inhabitants in the hour of fear and danger would undoubtedly avail themselves of its strength, as the fire from its battlements would be both annoying and destructive, and the narrow staircase would be easily defended, the artillery of those days having neither the power nor skill of the present. Note 3. âAgain we called in fresh aid from Halifax, Bingley, and their adjacent villages, and they came speedily to assist us; we also got a Captain from Halifax, a man of military skill, who instructed us in the best manner possible. Our Captain mustered all his men; the greatest part of these he placed in the church, and upon the steeple; the rest were armed with clubs, scythes, spits, halberts, sickles, laid in long poles, and such like rustic weapons; these he placed in such a manner as best to prevent the enemy from entering the town, or taking possession of the church.â âSee Lister's Account of the Siege of Bradford. Note 4. Sir T. Fairfax was the general who was so successful in the cause of the Parliament, and was almost considered invincible by his party. Note 5. In this scene I have introduced an Ecclesiastic, who, on account of his sacred function, is permitted, even in the rebel council, to pour forth for some time the effusions of a loyal heart.â Whatever impropriety there may be in the circumstance, or however unnatural the supposition, I could not refrain from introducing sentiments, which a better writer would have clothed in flowery language. Surely he had more right than the usurper Cromwell, who hypocritically could write to his brother-in-law, Colonel Valentine Walton, directly after the Battle of Marston-Moor, such letters as the two following, extracted from Mr. Ellis's Historical Collection:â âDeere Sir, âIt's our duty to sympathize in all mercyes, that wee praise the Lord together in chastisements or tryalls, that soe wee may sorrowe together. Truly England and the Church of God hath had a great favour from the Lord in this great victorie given unto us. Such as the like was never since this war begunn. It had all the evidences of an absolute victorie obtained by the Lord's blessinge, upon the Godly partye principally. Wee never charged, but we routed the enemy. The left winge, which I commanded, being our own horse, saving a few Scotts in our reere, beat all Prince's horse. God made them as stubble to our swords. Wee charged their regiments of foot with our horse, and routed all wee charged. The particulars I cannot relate now. But I believe, of 20,000, the Prince hath not 4,000 left. âGive glory, all the Glory to God.â This seems to have been written on the field of battle, and in a few days after the following. âDeere Sir, âGod hath taken away your eldest son by a cannon shott. Itt brake his Legge. Wee were necessitated to have itt taken off, whereof he died. Sir, you know my tryalls this way, but the Lord supported mee with this. That the Lord took him into all happiness wee all pant after, and live for. There is your precious child, full of glory, to know sinn nor sorrow any more. He was a gallant younge man, exceeding gracious. God gave you his comfort. Before his death hee was soe full of comfort, that to Frank Russell and myselfe he could not express itt, itt was soe great above his paine. This he said to us. Indeed itt was admirable. A little after he said, one thinge lay upon his spirits. I asked him what that was. Hee told mee that itt was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of his enemies. Att his fall, his horse beinge killed with the bullett, and, as I am informed, three horses more. I am told he bid them open right and left, that he might see the rogues runn. Truly he was exceedinglye beloved in the armie, of all that knew him.â But few knew him, for hee was a precious younge man, fitt for God. You have cause to bless the Lord. He is a glorious saint in Heaven, wherein you ought exceedlinglye to rejoyce. Lett this drinke up your sorrowe, seeinge theise are not fayned words to comfort you, but the thinge is soe real and undoubted a truth, you may doe all things by the strength of Christ. Seeke that, and you shall easily beare your tryall. Lett this publike mercy to the Church of God, make you forgett your private sorrowe.â The Lord be your strength, soe prayes âYour truly faythfull and lovinge brother OLIVER CROMWELL. July 5th., 1644. âMy love to your daughter, and my Cozen Perceval, Sister Desbrowe, and all friends with you.â Note 6. In this scene Lady Fairfax is introduced. She was, at the time referred to, undoubtedly at Bradford, as stated in Fairfax's Memoirs; where we are told that she rode behind a Captain Hill, ever willing to share the danger of her lord, rather than suffer the anxiety of being at a distance, while he was on the field. Note 8. Fairfax left Bradford only a very short time before it was in possession of the king's troops. Note 9. A young officer, said to be the Earl of Newport's son, headed a company of foot, and, under cover of a thick hedge, intended to force a passage through a house, and then surprise the church; but, rushing on too far before his men, he was met by some of the town's-men; and, seeing no way of escape, begged for quarter. He was answered by a town's-man (of the name of Atkinson), âI will give thee Bradford quarter!â upon which, he immediately slew him. Preston was the name of a Captain who came from Halifax, who was appointed the leader of the town's-men. Note 10. In the night-time, Sir T. Fairfax called a council of war, when it was resolved that every man should force his way through the enemy, sword in hand, or perish in the desperate attempt, which was put into execution, and achieved with the greatest bravery; and, though the royal party defended their passes with uncommon courage, the forces of the Parliament made their way through them, with the loss of comparatively few men. The remains of this great warrior, lie interred in the church of Bilbrough, about six miles south-west of York. Note 11. During the expectation of an awful event, the mind very naturally associates objects together which appear most in unison with it. Trifling things on these occasions wear an ominous appearance; and I believe there are very few who possess sufficient strength of mind entirely to disregard them at the moment, however they may afterwards despise the idea. Note 12. I have here introduced a Robber and Miser, in order, if possible, to excite a smile; but perhaps my readers may be serious in this place, and laugh through all the other pages. Note 13. The following is Lister's account of the reason for a forbearance little expected and as he was a spectator of the events of those times, some credit may be attached to his narration: âthat in the preceding night, Newcastle, while in bed at Bowling-Hall, was accosted by an apparition of a female form, which implored him to save the town, and either affrighted or melted him into compliance.â If there were any foundation for the story, either a strong impression may have been made upon his mind by a dream, or a real female, adventurous and patriotic, may have assumed the voice and disguise of a ghost, in order to work the more powerfully on the feelings of an exasperated conqueror. At all events, the lives of the unarmed inhabitants were spared, and the place became a garrison for the king. Note 14. The principal care of our pious ancestors was to preserve their church. They therefore suspended woolpacks on that side the steeple facing the enemy's battery, so near the roof of the church, that it was almost impossible to penetrate it. Note 15. In a sally, near the summit of a hill, on the way from Bradford to Leeds, Lady Fairfax, who had bravely accompanied her husbant through the campaign, was taken prisoner on horseback, but was generously sent back with an escort by Newcastle in his own coach.</field>
