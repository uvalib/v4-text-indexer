      <field name="fulltext">Troublesome Raigne of Iohn King of England, with the discouerie of King Richard Cordelions Base sonne (vulgarly named, The Bastard Fawconbridge): also the death of King Iohn at Swinstead Abbey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Gentlemen Readers. You that with friendly grace of smoothed brow Haue entertaind the Scythian Tamburlaine, And giuen applause vnto an Infidel: Vouchsafe to welcome (with like curtesie) A warlike Christian and your Countreyman. For Christs true faith indur'd he many a storme, And set himselfe against the Man of Rome, Vntill base treason (by a damned wight) Did all his former triumphs put to flight, Accept of it (sweete Gentles) in good sort, And thinke it was preparde for your disport.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter K. Iohn, Queene Elinor his mother, William Marshal Earle of Pembrooke, the Earles of Essex, and of Salisbury Queene Elianor. Barons of England, and my noble Lords: Though God and Fortune haue bereft from vs Uictorious Richard scourge of Infidels, And clad this Land in stole of dismall hieu: Yet giue me leaue to ioy, and ioy you all, That from this wombe hath sprung a second hope, A King that may in rule and vertue both Succeede his brother in his Emperie. K. Iohn My gracious mother Queene, and Barons all; Though farre vnworthie of so high a place, As is the Throne of mightie Englands King: Yet Iohn your Lord, contented vncontent, Will (as he may) sustaine the heauie yoke Of pressing cares, that hang vpon a Crowne. My Lord of Pembrooke and Lord Salsbury, Admit the Lord Shattilion to our presence; That we may know what Philip King of Fraunce (By his Ambassadors) requires of vs. Q. Elinor Dare lay my hand that Elinor can gesse Whereto this weightie Embassade doth tend: If of my Nephew Arthur and his claime, Then say my Sonne I haue not mist my aime. Enter Chattilion and the two Earles. Iohn My Lord Chattilion, welcome into England: How fares our Brother Philip King of Fraunce? Chatt. His Highnes at my comming was in health, And wild me to salute your Maiestie, And say the message he hath giuen in charge. Iohn And spare not man, we are preparde to heare. Chattilion Philip by the grace of God most Christian K. of France, hauing taken into his guardain and protection Arthur Duke of Brittaine, son &amp; heire to Ieffrey thine elder brother, requireth in the behalfe of the said Arthur, the Kingdom of England, with the Lordship of Ireland, Poiters, Aniow, Torain, Main: and I attend thine aunswere. Iohn A small request: belike he makes account That England, Ireland, Poiters, Aniow, Torain, Main, Are nothing for a King to giue at once: I wonder what he meanes to leaue for me. Tell Philip, he may keepe his Lords at home, With greater honour than to send them thus On Embassades that not concerne himselfe, Or if they did, would yeeld but small returne. Chatilion Is this thine answere? Iohn It is, and too good an answer for so proud a message. Chattilion Then King of England, in my Masters name, And in Prince Arthur Duke of Britaines name, I doo defie thee as an Enemie, And wish thee to prepare for bloodie warres. Q. Elinor My Lord (that stands vpon defiance thus) Commend me to my Nephew, tell the boy, That I Queene Elianor (his Grandmother) Upon my blessing charge him leaue his Armes, Whereto his head-strong Mother pricks him so: Her pride we know, and know her for a Dame That will not sticke to bring him to his ende, So she may bring her selfe to rule a Realme. Next wish him to forsake the King of Fraunce, And come to me and to his Unckle here, And he shall want for nothing at our hands. Chattilion. This shall I doo, and thus I take my leaue. Iohn Pembrooke, conuay him safely to the sea, But not in hast: for as we are aduisde, We meane to be in Fraunce as soone as he, To fortefie such townes as we possesse In Aniou, Torain and in Normandy. Exit Chatt. Enter the Shriue, &amp; whispers the Earle of Sals in the eare Salisbury. Please it your Maiestie, heere is the Shriue of Northhamptonshire, with certaine persons that of late committed a riot, and haue appeald to your Maiestie beseeching your Highnes for speciall cause to heare them. Iohn Wil them come neere, and while we heare the cause, Goe Salsbury and make prouision, We meane with speede to passe the sea to Fraunce. Say Shrieue, what are these men, what haue they done? Or wheretoo tends the course of this appeale? Shrieue Please it your Maiestie these two brethren vnnaturally falling at odds about their Fathers liuing haue broken your Highnes peace, in seeking to right their own wr?gs without cause of Law, or order of Iustice, and vnlawfully assembled themselues in mutinous manner, hauing committed a riot, appealing from triall in their Countrey to your Highnes: and here I Thomas Nidigate Shrieue of Northhamptonshire, doo deliuer them ouer to their triall. Iohn My Lord of Essex, will the offenders to stand foorth, and tell the cause of their quarrell. Essex Gentlemen, it is the Kings pleasure that you discouer your griefes, &amp; doubt not but you shall haue iustice. Philip Please it your Maiestie, the wrong is mine; yet wil I abide all wrongs, before I once open my mouth to vnrippe the shamefull slaunder of my parents, the dishonour of myself, &amp; the wicked dealing of my brother in this princely assembly. Robert Then by my Prince his leaue shall Robert speake, And tell your Maiestie what right I haue To offer wrong, as he accounteth wrong. My Father (not vnknowen vnto your Grace) Receiud his spurres of Knighthood in the Field, At Kingly Richards hands in Palestine, When as the walls of Acon gaue him way: His name Sir Robert Fauconbridge of Mountbery. What by succession from his Auncestours, And warlike seruice vnder Englands Armes, His liuing did amount too at his death Two thousand Markes reuenew euery yeare: And this (my Lord) I challenge for my right, As lawfull heire to Robert Fauconbridge. Philip If first-borne sonne be heire indubitate By certaine right of Englands auncient Lawe, How should myselfe make any other doubt, But I am heire to Robert Fauconbridge? Iohn Fond Youth, to trouble these our Princely eares Or make a question in so plaine a case: Speake, is this man thine elder Brother borne? Robert Please it your Grace with patience for to heare; I not denie but he mine Elder is, Mine elder Brother too: yet in such sort, As he can make no title to the Land. Iohn A doubtfull tale as euer I did heare, Thy Brother and thine elder, and no heire: Explaine this darke Ænigma. Robert I graunt (my Lord) he is my mothers sonne, Base borne, and base begot, no Fauconbridge. Indeede the world reputes him lawfull heire, My Father in his life did count him so, And here my Mother stands to prooue him so: But I (my Lord) can prooue, and doo auerre Both to my Mothers shame and his reproach, He is no heire, nor yet legitimate. Then (gracious Lord) let Fauconbridge enioy The liuing that belongs to Fauconbridge. And let not him possesse anothers right. Iohn Proue this, the land is thine by Englands law. Q. Elianor Ungracious youth, to rip thy mothers shame, The wombe from whence thou didst thy being take, All honest eares abhorre thy wickednes, But gold I see doth beate downe natures law. Mother. My gracious Lord, &amp; you thrice reuerend Dame, That see the teares distilling from mine eyes, And scalding sighes blowne from a rented heart: For honour and regard of womanhood, Let me entreate to be commaunded hence. Let not these eares receiue the hissing sound Of such a viper, who with poysoned words Doth masserate the bowels of my soule. Iohn Ladie, stand vp, be patient for a while: And fellow, say, whose bastard is thy brother. Philip Not for my selfe, nor for my mother now: But for the honour of so braue a Man, Whom he accuseth with adulterie: Here I beseech your Grace vpon my knees, To count him mad, and so dismisse vs hence. Robert Nor mad, nor mazde, but well aduised, I Charge thee before this royall presence here To be a Bastard to King Richards self, Sonne to your Grace, and Brother to your Maiestie. Thus bluntly, and Elianor Yong man thou needst not be ashamed of thy kin, Nor of thy Sire. But forward with thy proofe. Robert The proofe so plaine, the argument so strong, As that your Highnes and these noble Lords, And all (saue those that haue no eyes to see) Shall sweare him to be Bastard to the King. First when my Father was Embassadour In Germanie vnto the Emperour, The King lay often at my Fathers house; And all the Realme suspected what befell: And at my Fathers back returne agen My Mother was deliuered as tis sed, Sixe weekes before the account my Father made. But more than this: looke but on Philips face, His features, actions, and his lineaments, And all this Princely presence shall confesse, He is no other but King Richards Sonne. Then gracious Lord, rest he King Richards Sonne, And let me rest safe in my Fathers right, That am his rightfull sonne and onely heire. Iohn Is this thy proofe, and all thou hast to say? Robert I haue no more, nor neede I greater proofe. Iohn First, where thou saidst in absence of thy Sire My Brother often lodged in his house: And what of that? base groome to slaunder him, That honoured his Embassador so much, In absence of the man to cheere the wife? This will not hold, proceede vnto the next. Q Elinor Thou saist she teemde six weeks before her time. Why good Sir Squire are you so cunning growen To make account of womens reckonings: Spit in your hand and to your other proofes: Many mischaunces hap in such affaires To make a woman come before her time. Iohn And where thou saist he looketh like the King In action, feature and proportion: Therein I holde with thee, for in my life I neuer saw so liuely counterfet Of Richard Cordelion, as in him. Robert Then good my Lord, be you indifferent Iudge, And let me haue my liuing and my right. Q. Elinor Nay heare you Sir, you runne away too fast: Know you not, Omne simile non est idem? Or haue read in. Harke ye good sir, Twas thus I warrant, and no otherwise, She lay with Sir Robert your Father, and thought vppon King Richard my Sonne, and so your Brother was formed in this fashion. Robert Madame, you wrong me thus to iest it out, I craue my right: King Iohn as thou art King, So be thou iust, and let me haue my right. Iohn Why (foolish boy) thy proofes are friuolous, Nor canst thou chalenge any thing thereby. But thou shalt see how I will helpe thy claime, This is my doome, and this my doome shall stand Irreuocable, as I am King of England. For thou knowst not, weele aske of them that know, His mother and himselfe shall ende this strife: And as they say, so shall thy liuing passe. Robert My Lord, herein I chalenge you of wrong, To giue away my right, and put the doome Unto themselues. Can there be likelihood That she will loose? Or he will giue the liuing from himselfe? It may not be my Lord. Why should it be? Iohn Lords keepe him back, and let him heare the doome. Essex, first aske the Mother thrice who was his Sire? Essex Ladie Margaret Widow of Fauconbridge, Who was Father to thy Sonne Philip? Mother Please it your Maiestie, Sir Robert Fauconbridge. Robert This is right, aske my felow there if I be a thiefe. Iohn Aske Philip whose Sonne he is. Essex Philip, who was thy Father? Philip Mas my Lord, and thats a question: and you had not taken some paines with her before, I should haue desired you to aske my Mother. Iohn Say who was thy Father? Philip Faith (my Lord) to answere you sure he is my father that was neerest my mother when I was gotten, &amp; him I thinke to be Sir Robert Fauconbridge. Iohn Essex, for fashions sake demaund agen, And so an ende to this contention. Robert Was euer man thus wrongd as Robert is? Essex Philip speake I say, who was thy Father? Iohn Yong man how now, what art thou in a traunce? Elianor Philip awake, the man is in a dreame. Philip Philippus at auis ædite Regibus. What saist thou Philip, sprung of auncient Kings? Quo me rapit tempestas? What winde of honour blowes this furie forth? Or whence proeede these fumes of Maiestie? Me thinkes I heare a hollow Eccho sound, That Philip is the Sonne vnto a King: The whistling leaues vpon the trembling trees, Whistle in consort I am Richards Sonne: The bubling murmur of the waters fall, Records Philippus Regius filius: Birds in their flight make musicke with their wings, Filling the ayre with glorie of my birth: Birds, bubbles, leaues, and mountaines, Eccho, all Ring in mine eares, that I am Richards Sonne. Fond man, ah whether art thou carried? How are thy thoughts ywrapt in Honors heauen? Forgetfull what thou art, and whence thou camst. Thy Fathers land cannot maintaine these thoughts, These thoughts are farre vnfitting Fauconbridge: And well they may; for why this mounting minde Doth soare too high to stoupe to Fauconbridge. Why how now? knowest thou where thou art? And knowest thou who expects thine answere here? Wilt thou vpon a frantick madding vaine Goe loose thy land, and say thy selfe base borne? No, keepe thy land, though Richard were thy Sire, What ere thou thinkst, say thou art Fauconbridge. Iohn Speake man, be sodaine, who thy Father was. Philip Please it your Maiestie, Sir Robert Philip, that Fauconbridge cleaues to thy iawes: It will not out, I cannot for my life Say I am Sonne vnto a Fauconbridge. Let land and liuing goe, tis honors fire That makes me sweare King Richard was my Sire. Base to a King addes title of more State, Than Knights begotten, though legittimate. Please it your Grace, I am King Richards Sonne. Robert Robert reuiue thy heart, let sorrow die, His faltring tongue not suffers him to lie. Mother What head-strong furie doth enchaunt my sonne? Philip Philip cannot repent, for he hath done. Iohn Then Philip blame not me, thy selfe hast lost By wilfulnesse, thy liuing and thy land. Robert, thou art the heire of Fauconbridge, God giue thee ioy, greater than thy desert. Q Elianor Why how now Philip, giue away thine owne? Philip Madame, I am bold to make my selfe your nephew, The poorest kinsman that your Highnes hath: And with this Prouerb gin the world anew, Help hands, I haue no lands, honour is my desire; Let Philip liue to shew himselfe worthie so great a Sire. Elinor Philip, I think thou knewst thy Grandams minde: But cheere thee boy, I will not see thee want As long as Elinor hath foote of land; Henceforth thou shalt be taken for my sonne, And waite on me and on thine Unckle heere, Who shall giue honour to thy noble minde. Iohn Philip kneele down, that thou maist throughly know How much thy resolution pleaseth vs, Rise vp Sir Richard Plantaginet K. Richards Sonne. Phil. Graunt heauens that Philip once may shew himself Worthie the honour of Plantaginet, Or basest glorie of a Bastards name. Iohn Now Gentlemen, we will away to France, To checke the pride of Arthur and his mates: Essex, thou shalt be Ruler of my Realme, And toward the maine charges of my warres, Ile ceaze the lazie Abbey lubbers lands Into my hands to pay my men of warre. The Pope and Popelings shall not grease themselues With golde and groates, that are the souldiers due. Thus forward Lords, let our commaund be done, And march we forward mightely to Fraunce. Exeunt. Manet Philip and his Mother. Philip Madame I beseech you deigne me so much leasure as the hearing of a matter that I long to impart to you. Mother Whats the matter Philip. I thinke your sute in secret, tends to some money matter, which you suppose burns in the bottome of my chest. Phil. No Madam, it is no such sute as to beg or borrow, But such a sute, as might some other grant, I would not now haue troubled you withall. Mother A Gods name let vs heare it. Philip Then Madame thus, your Ladiship sees well, How that my scandall growes by meanes of you, In that report hath rumord vp and downe, I am a bastard, and no Fauconbridge. This grose attaint so tilteth in my thoughts, Maintaining combat to abridge my ease, That field and towne, and company alone, Whatso I doo, or wheresoere I am, I cannot chase the slaunder from thy thoughts. If it be true, resolue me of my Sire, For pardon Madame, if I thinke amisse. Be Philip Philip and no Fauconbridge, His Father doubtles was as braue a man. To you on knees as sometime Phaeton, Mistrusting silly Merop for his Sire, Strayning a little bashfull modestie, I beg some instance whence I am extraught. Mother Yet more adoo to haste me to my graue, And wilt thou too become a Mothers crosse? Must I accuse myself to close with you? Slaunder myself to quiet your affects: Thou mooust me Philip with this idle talke, Which I remit, in hope this mood will die. Philip Nay Ladie mother, heare me further yet, For strong conceipt driues dutie hence awhile: Your husband Fauconbridge was Father to that sonne, That carries marks of Nature like the Sire, The sonne that blotteth you with wedlocks breach, And holds my right, as lineall in discent From him whose forme was figured in his face. Can Nature so dissemble in her frame, To make the one so like as like may be, And in the other print no character To chalenge any marke of true discent? My brothers minde is base, and too too dull, To mount where Philip lodgeth his affects, And his externall graces that you view (Though I report it) counterpoise not mine: His constitution plaine debilitie, Requires the chayre, and mine the seate of steele. Nay, what is he, or what am I to him? When any one that knoweth how to carpe, Will scarcely iudge vs both one Countrey borne. This Madame, this, hath droue me from myselfe: And here by heauens eternall lampes I sweare, As cursed Nero with his mother did, So I with you, if you resolue me not. Mother Let mothers teares quench out thy angers fire, And vrge no further what thou doost require. Philip Let sonnes entreatie sway the mother now, Or els she dies: Ile not infringe my vow. Mother Unhappy taske: must I recount my shame, Blab my misdeedes, or by concealing die? Some power strike me speechlesse for a time, Or take from him awhile his hearings vse. Why wish I so, vnhappy as I am? The fault is mine, and he the faultie frute, I blush, I faint, oh would I might be mute. Philip Mother be briefe, I long to know my name. Mother And longing dye to shrowd thy Mothers shame. Philip Come Madame come, you neede not be so loth, The shame is shared equall twixt vs both. Ist not a slacknes in me worthie blame, To be so olde, and cannot write my name. Good Mother resolue me. Mother Then Philip heare thy fortune and my griefe, My honours losse by purchase of thy selfe, My shame, thy name, and husbands secret wrong, All maind and staind by youths vnruly sway. And when thou knowest from whence thou art extraught, Or if thou knewst what sutes, what threates, what feares, To mooue by loue, or massacre by death. To yeeld with loue, or end by loues contempt. The mightines of him that courted me, Who tempred terror with his wanton talke, That something may extenuate the guilt. But let it not aduantage me so much: Upbraid me rather with the Romane Dame That shed her blood to wash away her shame. Why stand I to expostulate the crime With pro &amp; contra, now the deede is don, When to conclude two words may tell the tale, That Philips Father was a Princes Son, Rich Englands rule, worlds onely terror hee, For honours losse left me with childe of thee: Whose Sonne thou art, then pardon me the rather, For faire King Richard was thy noble Father. Philip Then Robin Fauconbridge I wish thee ioy, My Sire a King, and I a landles Boy. Gods Ladie Mother, the world is in my debt, There's something owing to Plantaginet. I marrie Sir, let me alone for game, Ile act some wonders now I know my name. By blessed Marie Ile not sell that pride For Englands wealth, and all the world beside. Sit fast the proudest of my Fathers foes, Away good Mother, there the comfort goes. Exeunt. Enter Philip the French King, and Lewes, Limoges, Constance, and her sonne Arthur. King Now gin we broach the title of thy claime Yong Arthur in the Albion Territories, Scaring proud Angiers with a puissant siedge: Braue Austria, cause of Cordelions death, Is also come to aide thee in thy warres; And all our Forces ioyne for Arthurs right. And, but for causes of great consequence, Pleading delay till newes from England come, Twice should not Titan hide him in the West, To coole the fet-locks of his wearie teame, Till I had with an vnresisted shock Controld the mannage of proud Angiers walls, Or made a forfet of my fame to Chaunce. Constance May be that Iohn in conscience or in feare To offer wrong where you impugne the ill, Will send such calme conditions backe to Fraunce, As shall rebate the edge of fearefull warres: If so, forbearance is a deede well done. Arthur Ah Mother, possession of a Crowne is much, And Iohn as I haue heard reported of, For present vantage would aduenture farre. The world can witnes in his Brothers time, He tooke vpon him rule and almost raigne: Then must it follow as a doubtfull poynt, That hee'le resigne the rule vnto his Nephew. I rather thinke the menace of the world Sounds in his eares as threats of no esteeme, And sooner would he scorne Europaes power, Than loose the smallest title he enioyes; For questionles he is an Englishman. Lewes Why are the English peereles in compare? Braue Caualiers as ere that Iland bred, Haue liude and dyde, and darde and done inough, Yet neuer gracde their Countrey for the cause: England is England, yeelding good and bad, And Iohn of England is as other Iohns. Trust me yong Arthur, if thou like my reede, Praise thou the French that helpe thee in this neede. Lymoges The Englishman hath little cause I trow, To spend good speaches on so proud a foe. Why Arthur heres his spoyle that now is gon, Who when he liude outroude his Brother Iohn: But hastie curres that lie so long to catch, Come halting home, and meete their ouermatch. But newes comes now, heres the Embassadour. Enter Chattilion. K Philip And in good time, welcome my Lord Chattilion: What newes? will Iohn accord to our commaund. Chattilion Be I not briefe to tell your Highnes all, He will approach to interrupt my tale: For one selfe bottome brought vs both to Fraunce. He on his part will try the chaunce of warre, And if his words inferre assured truth, Will loose himselfe and all his followers, Ere yeeld vnto the least of your demaunds. The Mother Queene she taketh on amaine Gainst Ladie Constance, counting her the cause That doth effect this claime to Albion, Coniuring Arthur with a Grandames care, To leaue his Mother; willing him submit His state to Iohn and her protection, Who (as she saith) are studious for his good: More circumstance the season intercepts: This is the summe, which briefly I haue showne. K. Phil. This bitter winde must nip some bodies spring, Sodaine and briefe, why so, tis haruest weather. But say Chattilion, what persons of accompt are with him? Chattilion Of England Earle Pembrooke and Salsbury, The onely noted men of any name. Next them a Bastard of the Kings deceast, A hardy wilde head, tough and venturous, With many other men of high resolue. Then is there with them Elinor Mother Queene, And Blanch her Neece daughter to the King of Spaine: These are the prime Birds of this hot aduenture. Enter Iohn &amp; his followers, Queene, Bastard, Earles, &amp;c. K. Philip Me seemeth Iohn an ouer-daring spirit Effects some frenzie in thy rash approach, Treading my Confines with thy armed Troupes. I rather lookt for some submisse reply Touching the claime thy Nephew Arthur makes To that which thou vniustly dost vsurpe. K Iohn For that Chattilion can discharge you all, I list not plead my Title with my tongue. Nor came I hether with intent of wrong To Fraunce or thee, or any right of thine; But in defence and purchase of my right, The Towne of Angiers: which thou doost begirt In the behalfe of Ladie Constance Sonne, Wheretoo nor he nor she can lay iust claime. Constance Yes (false intruder) if that iust be iust, And headstrong vsurpation put apart, Arthur my Sonne, heire to thy elder Brother, Without ambiguous shadow of discent, Is Soueraigne to the substance thou withholdst. Q. Elinor Misgouernd Gossip, staine to this resort, Occasion of these vndecided iarres, I say (that know) to check thy vaine suppose, Thy Sonne hath naught to doo with that he claymes. For proofe whereof, I can inferre a Will, That barres the way he vrgeth by discent. Constance A Will indeede, a crabbed Womans will, Wherein the Diuell is an ouerseer, And proud dame Elnor sole Executresse: More wills than so, on perill of my soule, Were neuer made to hinder Arthurs right. Arthur But say there was, as sure there can be none, The law intends such testaments as voyd, Where right discent can no way be impeacht. Q Elinor Peace Arthur peace, thy mother makes thee wings To soare with perill after Icarus, And trust me yongling for the Fathers sake, I pitie much the hazard of thy youth. Constance Beshrew you els how pitifull you are, Readie to weepe to heare him aske his owne; Sorrow betide such Grandames and such griefe, That minister a poyson for pure loue. But who so blinde, as cannot see this beame, That you forsooth would keepe your cousin downe, For feare his Mother should be vsde too well? I theres the griefe, confusion catch the braine, That hammers shifts to stop a Princes raigne. Q. Elianor Impatient, frantike, common slanderer, Immodest Dame, vnnurtred quarreller, I tell thee I, not enuie to thy Son, But iustice makes me speake as I haue don. K. Philip But heres no proof that showes your son a King. K. Iohn. What wants, my sword shal more at large set down. Lewes But that may breake before the truth be knowne. Bastard Then this may hold till all his right be showne. Lymoges Good words sir sauce, your betters are in place. Bastard Not you sir doughtie with your Lions case. Blanch Ah ioy betide his soule, to whom that spoile bel?gd Ah Richard how thy glorie here is wrongd. Lymoges Me thinkes that Richards pride, &amp; Richards fall, Should be a president t'affright you all. Bastard What words are these? how doo my sinews shake? My Fathers foe clad in my Fathers spoyle, A thousand furies kindle with reuendge, This hart that choller keepes a consistorie, Searing my inwards with a brand of hate: How doth Alecto whisper in mine eares? Delay not Philip, kill the villaine straight, Disrobe him of the matchles moniment Thy Fathers triumph ore the Sauages, Base heardgroome, coward, peasant, worse than a threshing slaue, What makst thou with the Trophei of a King? Shamst thou not coystrell, loathsome dunghill swad, To grace thy carkasse with an ornament Too precious for a Monarchs couerture? Scarce can I temper due obedience Unto the presence of my Soueraigne, From acting outrage on this trunke of hate: But arme thee traytor, wronger of renowme, For by his soule I sweare, my Fathers soule, Twice will I not review the Mornings rise, Till I haue torne that Trophei from thy back, And split thy heart, for wearing it so long. Philip hath sworne, and if it be not done, Let not the world repute me Richards Sonne. Lymoges Nay soft sir Bastard, harts are not split so soone, Let them reioyce that at the ende doo win: And take this lesson at thy foemans hand, Pawne not thy life, to get thy Fathers skin. Blanch Well may the world speake of his knightly valor, That winnes this hide to weare a Ladies fauour. Bastard Ill may I thriue, and nothing brooke with mee, If shortly I present it not to thee. K. Philip Lordings forbeare, for time is comming fast, That deedes may trie what words cannot determine, And to the purpose for the cause you come. Me seemes you set right in chaunce of warre, Yeelding no other reasons for your claime, But so and so, because it shall be so. So wrong shalbe subornd by trust of strength: A Tyrants practize to inuest himselfe, Where weake resistance giueth wrong the way. To check the which, in holy lawfull Armes, I in the right of Arthur Geffreys Sonne, Am come before this Citie of Angiers, To barre all other false supposed clayme, From whence or howsoere the error springs. And in his quarrell on my Princely word, Ile fight it out vnto the latest man. Iohn Know King of Fraunce, I will not be commaunded By any power or Prince in Christendome, To yeeld an instance how I hold mine owne, More than to answere, that mine owne is mine. But wilt thou see me parley with the Towne, And heare them offer me alleageance, Fealtie and homage, as true liege men ought. K. Philip Summon them, I will not beleeue it till I see it, and when I see it Ile soone change it. They summon the Towne, the Citizens appeare vpon the walls. K. Iohn You men of Angiers, and as I take it my loyall Subiects, I haue summoned you to the walls: to dispute on my right, were to thinke you doubtfull therein, which I am perswaded you are not. In few words, our Brothers Sonne, backt with the King of Fraunce, haue beleagred your Towne vpon a false pretended title to the same: in defence whereof I your liege Lord haue brought our power to fence you from the Usurper, to free your intended seruitude, and vtterly to supplant the foemen, to my right &amp; your rest. Say then, who who keepe you the Towne for? Citizen For our lawfull King. Iohn I was no lesse perswaded: then in Gods name open your gates, and let me enter. Citizen And it please your Highnes we comptroll not your title, neither will we rashly admit your entrance: if you bee lawfull King, with all obedience we keepe it to your vse, if not King, our rashnes to be impeached for yeelding, without more considerate triall: we answere not as men lawles, but to the behoofe of him that prooues lawfull. Iohn I shall not come in then? Citizen No my Lord, till we know more. K. Philip Then heare me speake in the behalfe of Arthur Sonne of Geffrey elder Brother to Iohn, his title manifest without contradiction to the Crowne and Kingdome of England, with Angiers and diuers Townes on this side the sea: will you acknowledge him your liege Lord, who speaketh in my word to intertaine you with all fauours as beseemeth a King to his subiects, or a friend to his wel-willers: or stand to the perill of your contempt, when his title is prooued by the sword. Citizen We answere as before till you haue prooued one right, we acknowledge none right, he that tries himselfe our Soueraigne, to him will we remaine firme subiects, and for him, and in his right we hold our Towne as desirous to know the truth as loath to subscribe before we knowe? More than this we cannot say, and more than this we dare not doo. K. Philip Then Iohn I defie thee in the name and behalfe of Arthur Plantaginet thy King and cousin, whose right and patrimonie thou detainest, as I doubt not ere the day ende in a set battell make thee confesse; whereunto with a zeale to right I challenge thee. K. Iohn I accept the challenge, and turne the defiance to thy throate. Excursions. The Bastard chaseth Lymoges the Austrich Duke, and maketh him leaue the Lyons skinne. Bastard And art thou gone, misfortune haunt thy steps, And chill colde feare assaile thy times of rest. Morpheus leaue here thy silent Eban caue, Besiedge his thoughts with dismall fantasies, And ghastly obiects of pale threatning Mors. Affright him euery minute with stearne lookes, Let shadowe temper terror in his thoughts, And let the terror make the coward mad, And in his madnes let him feare pursute, And so in frenzie let the peasant die. Here is the ransome that allayes his rage, The first freehold that Richard left his sonne: With which I shall surprize his liuing foes, As Hectors statue did the fainting Greekes. Exit. Enter the Kings Herolds with Trumpets to the wals of Angiers: they summon the Towne. Eng. Herold Iohn by the grace of God King of England, Lord of Ireland, Aniou, Toraine, &amp;c. demaundeth once againe of you his subiects of Angiers, if you will quietly surrender vp the Towne into his hands? Fr. Herold Philip by the grace of God King of Fraunce, demaundeth in the behalfe of Arthur Duke of Britaine, if you will surrender vp the Towne into his hands, to the vse of the said Arthur. Citizens Herrolds goe tell the two victorious Princes, that we the poore Inhabitants of Angiers, require a parle of their Maiesties. Herolds We goe. Enter the Kings, Queene Elianor, Blaunch, Bastard, Lymoges, Lewes, Castilean, Pembrooke, Salisbury, Constance, and Arthur Duke of Britaine. Iohn Herold, what answere doo the Townsmen send? Philip Will Angiers yeeld to Philip King of Fraunce, En. Her. The Townsmen on the wals accept your Grace. Fr. Her. And craue a parley of your Maiestie. Iohn You Citizens of Angiers, haue your eyes Beheld the slaughter that our English bowes Haue made vpon the coward frawdfull French? And haue you wisely pondred therewithall Your gaine in yeelding to the English King? Philip Their losse in yeelding to the English King. But Iohn, they saw from out their highest Towers The Cheualiers of Fraunce and crossebow shot Make lanes of slaughtred bodies through thine hoast, And are resolude to yeelde to Arthurs right. Iohn Why Philip, though thou brauest it fore the walls, Thy conscience knowes that Iohn hath wonne the field. Philip What ere my conscience knows, thy Armie feeles That Philip had the better of the day. Bastard Philip indeede hath got the Lyons case, Which here he holds to Lymoges disgrace. Base Duke to flye and leaue such spoyles behinde: But this thou knewst of force to make mee stay. It farde with thee as with the marriner, Spying the hugie Whale, whose monstrous bulke Doth beare the waues like mountaines fore the winde, That throwes out emptie vessells, so to stay His furie, while the ship doth saile away. Philip tis thine: and fore this Princely presence, Madame I humbly lay it at your feete, Being the first aduenture I atchieud, And first exployt your Grace did enioyne: Yet many more I long to be enioynd. Blaunch Philip I take it, and I thee commaund To weare the same as earst thy Father did: Therewith receiue this fauour at my hands, T'incourage thee to follow Richards fame. Arthur Ye Citizens of Angiers, are ye mute? Arthur or Iohn, say which shall be your King? Citizen We care not which, if once we knew the right, But till we know we will not yeeld our right. Bastard Might Philip counsell two so mightie Kings, As are the Kings of England and of Fraunce, He would aduise your Graces to vnite And knit your forces gainst these Citizens, Pulling their battered walls about their eares. The Towne once wonne then striue about the claime, For they are minded to delude you both. Citizen Kings, Princes, Lords &amp; Knights assembled here, The Citizens of Angiers all by me Entreate your Maiestie to heare them speake: And as you like the motion they shall make, So to account and follow their aduice. Iohn., Philip Speake on, we giue thee leaue. Citizen Then thus: whereas that yong &amp; lustie knight Incites you on to knit your kingly strengths: The motion cannot choose but please the good, And such as loue the quiet of the State. But how my Lords, how should your strengths be knit? Not to oppresse your subiects and your friends, And fill the world with brawles and mutinies: But vnto peace your forces should be knit To liue in Princely league and amitie: Doo this, the gates of Angiers shall giue way And stand wide open to your harts content. To make this peace a lasting bond of loue, Remains one onely honorable meanes, Which by your pardon I shall here display. Lewes the Dolphin and the heire of Fraunce, A man of noted valor through the world, Is yet vnmaried: let him take to wife The beauteous daughter of the King of Spaine, Neece to K. Iohn, the louely Ladie Blanche, Begotten on his Sister Elianor. With her in marriage will her vnckle giue Castles and Towers as fitteth such a match. The Kings thus ioynd in league of perfect loue, They may so deale with Arthur Duke of Britaine, Who is but yong, and yet vnmeete to raigne, As he shall stand contented euerie way. Thus haue I boldly (for the common good) Deliuered what the Citie gaue in charge. And as vpon conditions you agree, So shall we stand content to yeeld the Towne. Arthur A proper peace, if such a motion hold; These Kings beare armes for me, and for my right, And they shall share my lands to make them friends. Q. Elianor Sonne Iohn, follow this motion, as thou louest thy mother, Make league with Philip, yeeld to any thing: Lewes shall haue my Neece, and then be sure Arthur shall haue small succour out of Fraunce. Iohn Brother of Fraunce, you heare the Citizens: Then tell me, how you meane to deale herein. Constance Why Iohn, what canst thou giue vnto thy Neece, That hast no foote of land, but Arthurs right? Lewes Byr Ladie Citizens, I like your choyce, A louely Damsell is the Ladie Blanche, Worthie the heire of Europe for her pheere. Constance What Kings, why stand you gazing in a trance? Why how now Lords? accursed Citizens To fill and tickle their ambicious eares, With hope of gaine, that springs from Arthurs losse. Some dismall Plannet at thy birthday raignd, For now I see the fall of all thy hopes. K. Philip Ladie, and Duke of Britaine, know you both, The King of Fraunce respects his honor more, Than to betray his friends and fauourers. Princesse of Spaine, could you affect my Sonne, If we vpon conditions could agree? Bastard Swounds Madam, take an English Gentleman: Slaue as I was, I thought to haue mooude the match. Grandame you made me halfe a promise once, That Lady Blanch should bring me wealth inough, And make me heire of store of English land. Q. Elianor Peace Philip, I will looke thee out a wife, We must with pollicie compound this strife. Bastard If Lewes get her, well, I say no more: But let the frolicke Frenchman take no scorne, If Philip front him with an English horne. Iohn Ladie, what answere make you to the King of France? Can you affect the Dolphin for your Lord? Blanch I thanke the King that likes of me so well, To make me Bride vnto so great a Prince: But giue me leaue my Lord to pause on this, Least being too too forward in the cause, It may be blemish to my modestie. Q Elinor Sonne Iohn, and worthie Philip K. of Fraunce, Doo you confer a while about the Dower, And I will schoole my modest Neece so well, That she shall yeeld assoone as you haue done. Constance I, theres the wretch that broacheth all this ill, Why flye I not vpon the Beldames face, And with my nayles pull foorth her hatefull eyes. Arthur Sweete Mother cease these hastie madding fits: For my sake, let my Grandame haue her will. O would she with her hands pull forth my heart, I could affoord it to appease these broyles. But mother let vs wisely winke at all: Least farther harmes ensue our hastie speach. Philip Brother of England, what dowrie wilt thou giue Unto my Sonne in marriage with thy Neece? Iohn First Philip knowes her dowrie out of Spaine To be so great as may content a King: But more to mend and amplifie the same, I giue in money thirtie thousand markes. For land I leaue it to thine owne demaund. Philip Then I demaund Volquesson, Torain, Main, Poiters and Aniou, these fiue Prouinces, Which thou as King of England holdst in Fraunce: Then shall our peace be soone concluded on. Bastard No lesse than fiue such Prouinces at once? Iohn Mother what shall I doo? my brother got these lands With much effusion of our English bloud: And shall I giue it all away at once? Q. Elinor Iohn giue it him, so shalt thou liue in peace, And keepe the residue sanz ieopardie. Ion Philip bring forth thy Sonne, here is my Neece, And here in mariage I doo giue with her From me and my Successors English Kings, Volquesson, Poiters, Aniou, Torain, Main, And thirtie thousand markes of stipend coyne. Now Citizens, how like you of this match? Citizen We ioy to see so sweete a peace begun. Lewes Lewes with Blanch shall euer liue content. But now King Iohn, what say you to the Duke? Father, speake as you may in his behalfe. Philip K. Iohn, be good vnto thy Nephew here, And giue him somewhat that shall please thee best. Iohn Arthur, although thou troublest Englands peace: Yet here I giue thee Brittaine for thine owne, Together with the Earledome of Richmont, And this rich Citie of Angiers withall. Q. Elianor And if thou seeke to please thine Unckle Iohn, Shalt see my Sonne how I will make of thee. Iohn Now euery thing is sorted to this end, Lets in and there prepare the mariage rytes, Which in S. Maries Chappell presently Shalbe performed ere this Presence part. Exeunt. Manent Constance &amp; Arthur. Arthur Madam good cheere, these drouping languishm?ts Adde no redresse to salue our awkward haps. If heauens haue concluded these euents, To small auaile is bitter pensiuenes: Seasons will change, and so our present griefe May change with them, and all to our reliefe. Constance Ah boy, thy yeares I see are farre too greene To looke into the bottome of these cares. But I, who see the poyse that weigheth downe Thy weale, my wish, and all the willing meanes Wherewith thy fortune and thy fame should mount. What ioy, what ease, what rest can lodge in me, With whom all hope and hap doth disagree? Arthur Yet Ladies teares, and cares, and solemne shows, Rather than helpes, heape vp more worke for woes. Constance If any Power will heare a widdowes plaint, That from a wounded soule implores reuenge; Send fell contagion to infect this Clyme, This cursed Countrey, where the traytors breath, Whose periurie as prowd Briareus, Beleaguers all the Skie with misbeliefe. He promist Arthur, and he sware it too, To fence thy right, and check thy foemans pride: But now black-spotted Periure as he is, He takes a truce with Elnors damned brat, And marries Lewes to her louely Neece, Sharing thy fortune, and thy birth-dayes gift Betweene these louers: ill betide the match. And as they shoulder thee from out thy owne, And triumph in a widowes tearefull cares: So heauens crosse them with a thriftles course. Is all the bloud yspilt on either part, Closing the cranies of the thirstie earth, Growne to a louegame and a Bridall feast? And must thy birthright bid the wedding banes? Poore helples boy, hopeles and helples too, To whom misfortune seemes no yoke at all. Thy stay, thy state, thy imminent mishaps Woundeth thy mothers thoughts with feeling care, Why lookst thou pale? the colour flyes thy face, I trouble now the fountaine of thy youth, And make it moodie with my doles discourse, Goe in with me, reply not louely boy, We must obscure this mone with melodie, Least worser wrack ensue our malecontent. Exeunt. Enter the King of England, the King of Fraunce, Arthur, Bastard, Lewes, Lymoges, Constance, Blanche, Chattilion, Pembrooke, Salisburie, and Elianor. Iohn This is the day, the long desired day, Wherein the Realmes of England and of Fraunce Stand highly blessed in a lasting peace. Thrice happie is the Bridegroome and the Bride, From whose sweete Bridale such a concord springs, To make of mortall foes immortall friends. Constance Ungodly peace made by an others warre. Philip Unhappie peace, that ties thee from reuenge. Rouse thee Plantaginet, liue not to see The butcher of the great Plantiginet. Kings, Princes, and ye Peeres of either Realmes, Pardon my rashnes, and forgiue the zeale That caries me in furie to a deede Of high desert, of honour, and of armes. A boone O Kings, a boone doth Philip beg Prostrate vpon his knee: which knee shall cleaue Unto the superficies of the earth, Till Fraunce and England graunt this glorious boone. Iohn Speake Philip, England graunts thee thy request. Philip And Fraunce confirmes what ere is in his power. Bastard Then Duke sit fast, I leuell at thy head, Too base a ransome for my fathers life. Princes, I craue the Combat with the Duke That braues it in dishonor of my Sire. Your words are past nor can you now reuerse The Princely promise that reuiues my soule, Whereat me thinks I see his sinnews shake: This is the boon (dread Lords) which granted once Or life or death are pleasant to my soule; Since I shall liue and die in Richards right. Lymoges Base Bastard, misbegotten of a King. To interrupt these holy nuptiall rytes With brawles and tumults to a Dukes disgrace: Let it suffice, I scorne to ioyne in fight, With one so farre vnequall to my selfe. Bastard A fine excuse, Kings if you wilbe Kings, Then keepe your words, and let vs combat it. Iohn Philip, we cannot force the Duke to fight, Bring a subiect vnto neither Realme: But tell me Austria, if an English Duke Should dare thee thus, wouldst thou accept the challendge? Lymoges Els let the world account the Austrich Duke The greatest coward liuing on the Earth. Iohn Then cheere thee Philip, Iohn will keepe his word, Kneele downe, in sight of Philip King of Fraunce And all these Princely Lords assembled here, I gird thee with the sword of Normandie, And of that land I doo inuest thee Duke: So shalt thou be in liuing and in land Nothing inferiour vnto Austria. Lymoges K. Iohn, I tell thee flatly to thy face Thou wrongst mine honour: and that thou maist see How much I scorne thy new made Duke and thee, I flatly say, I will not be compeld: And so farewell Sir Duke of low degree, Ile finde a time to match you for this geere. Exit. Iohn Stay Philip, let him goe the honors thine. Bastard I cannot liue vnles his life be mine. Q. Elianor Thy forwardnes this day hath ioyd my soule. And made me thinke my Richard liues in thee. K. Philip Lordings lets in, and spend the wedding day In maskes and triumphs, letting quarrells cease. Enter a Cardynall from Rome. Card. Stay King of France, I charge thee ioyn not hands With him that stands accurst of God and men. Know Iohn, that I Pandulph Cardinall of Millaine, and Legate from the Sea of Rome, demaund of thee in the name of our holy Father the Pope Innocent, why thou dost (contrarie to the lawes of our holy mother the Church, and our holye father the Pope) disturbe the quiet of the Church, and disanull the election of Stephen Langhton, whom his Holines hath elected Archbishop of Canterburie: this in his Holines name I demaund of thee? Iohn And what hast thou or the Pope thy maister to doo to demaund of me, how I employ mine owne? Know sir Priest as I honour the Church and holy Churchmen, so I scorne to be subiect to the greatest Prelate in the world. Tell thy Maister so from me, and say, Iohn of England said it, that neuer an Italian Priest of them all, shall either haue tythe, tole, or poling penie out of England, but as I am King, so wil I raigne next vnder God, supreame head both ouer spirituall and temrall: and hee that contradicts me in this, Ile make him hoppe headlesse. K. Philip What King Iohn, know you what you say, thus to blaspheme against our holy father the Pope. Iohn Philip, though thou and all the Princes of Christendome suffer themselues to be abusde by a Prelates slauerie, my minde is not of such base temper. If the Pope will bee King in England, let him winne it with the sword, I know no other title he can alleage to mine inheritance. Card. Iohn, this is thine answere? Iohn What then? Card. Then I Pandulph of Padoa, Legate from the Apostolick Sea, doo in the name of S. Peter and his successor our holy Father Pope Innocent, pronounce thee accursed discharging euery of thy subiectes of all dutie and fealtie that they doo owe to thee, and pardon and forgiuenes of sinne to those or them whatsoeuer, which shall carrie armes against thee, or murder thee: this I pronounce, and charge all good men to abhorre thee as an excommunicate person. Iohn So sir, the more the Fox is curst the better a fares: if God blesse me and my Land, let the Pope and his shauelings curse and spare not. Card. Furthermore I charge thee Philip King of France, and al the Kings and Princes of Christendome, to make war vppon this miscreant: and whereas thou hast made a league with him, and confirmed it by oath, I doo in the name of our foresaid father the Pope, acquit thee of that oath as vnlawful, being made with an heretike, how saist thou Philip, doost thou obey? Iohn Brother of Fraunce, what say you to the Cardinall? Philip I say, I am sorrie for your Maiestie, requesting you to submit your selfe to the Church of Rome. Iohn And what say you to our league, if I doo not submit? Philip What should I say? I must obey the Pope. Iohn Obey the Pope, and breake your oath to God? Philip The Legate hath absolude me of mine oath: Then yeeld to Rome, or I defie thee heere. Iohn Why Philip, I defie the Pope and thee, False as thou art, and periurde K. of Fraunce, Unworthie man to be accompted King. Giu'st thou thy sword into a Prelates hands? Pandulph, where I of Abbots, Monkes and Friers Haue taken somewhat to maintaine my warres, Now will I take no more but all they haue. Ile rowze the lazie lubbers from their Cells, And in despight Ile send them to the Pope. Mother, come you with me, and for the rest That will not follow Iohn in this attempt, Confusion light vpon their damned soules. Come Lords, fight for your King that fighteth for your good? Philip And are they gone? Pandulph thy selfe shalt see How Fraunce will fight for Rome and Romish rytes. Nobles, to armes, let him not passe the seas, Lets take him captiue, and in triumph lead The K. of England to the gates of Rome. Arthur, bestirre thee man, and thou shalt see What Philip K. of Fraunce will doo for thee. Blanche And will your Grace vpon your wedding day Forsake your Bride and follow dreadfull drums: Nay, good my Lord, stay you at home with mee. Lewes Sweete heart content thee, and we shall agree. Philip Follow me Lords, Lord Cardynall lead the way, Drums shalbe musique to this wedding day. Exeunt. Excursions. The Bastard pursues Austria, and kills him. Bastard Thus hath K. Richards Sonne performde his vowes. And offred Austrias bloud for sacrifice Unto his fathers euerliuing soule. Braue Cordelion, now my heart doth say, I haue deserude, though not to be thy heire Yet as I am, thy base begotten sonne, A name as pleasing to thy Philips heart, As to be cald the Duke of Normandie. Lie there a pray to euery rauening fowle: And as my Father triumpht in thy spoyles, And trode thine Ensignes vnderneath his feete, So doo I tread vpon thy cursed selfe, And leaue thy bodie to the fowles for food. Exit. Excursions. Arthur, Constance, Lewes, hauing taken Q. Elianor prisoner. Constance Thus hath the God of Kings with conquering arme Dispearst the foes to true succession. Proud, and disturber of thy Countreyes peace, Constance doth liue to tame thine insolence, And on thy head will now auenged be For all the mischiefes hatched in thy braine. Q Elinor Contemptuous dame vnreuent Dutches thou, To braue so great a Queene as Elianor. Base scolde hast thou forgot, that I was wife, And mother to three mightie English Kings? I charge thee then, and you forsooth sir Boy, To set your Grandmother at libertie, And yeeld to Iohn your Unckle and your King. Constance Tis not thy words proud Queene shal carry it. Elianor Nor yet thy threates proud Dame shal daunt my minde. Arthur Sweete Grandame, and good Mother leaue these brawles. Elianor Ile finde a time to triumph in thy fall. Constance My time is now to triumph in thy fall, And thou shalt know that Constance will triumph. Arthur Good Mother weigh it is Queene Elianor, Though she be captiue, vse her like herselfe. Sweete Grandame beare with what my Mother sayes, Your Highnes shalbe vsed honourably. Enter a Messenger. Mess. Lewes my Lord, Duke Arthur, and the rest, To armes in hast, K. Iohn relyes his men, And ginnes the fight afresh: and sweares withall To lose his life, or set his Mother free. Lewes Arthur away, tis time to looke about. Elianor Why how now dame, what is your courage coold? Constance No Elianor, my courage gathers strength, And hopes to lead both Iohn and thee as slaues: And in that hope, I hale thee to the field. Exeunt. Excursions. Elianor is rescued by Iohn, and Arthur is taken prisoner. Exeunt. Sound victorie. Enter Iohn, Elianor, and Arthur Prisoner, Bastard, Pembrooke, Salisbury, and Hubert de Burgh. Iohn Thus right triumphs, and Iohn triumphs in right. Arthur thou seest, Fraunce cannot bolster thee: Thy Mothers pride hath brought thee to this fall. But if at last, Nephew thou yeeld thy selfe Into the gardance of thine Unckle Iohn, Thou shalt be vsed as becomes a Prince. Arthur Unckle, my Grandame taught her Nephew this, To beare captiuitie with patience. Might hath preuayld not right, for I am King Of England, though thou we are the Diadem. Q. Elianor Sonne Iohn, soone shall we teach him to forget These proud presumptions, and to know himselfe. Iohn Mother, he neuer will forget his claime, I would he liude not to remember it. But leauing this, we will to England now, And take some order with our Popelings there, That swell with pride, and fat of lay mens lands. Philip I make thee chiefe in this affaire, Ransack the Abbeys, Cloysters, Priories, Conuert their coyne vnto my souldiers vse: And whatsoere he be within my Land, That goes to Rome for iustice and for law, While he may haue his right within the Realme, Let him be iudgde a traitor to the State, And suffer as an enemie to England. Mother, we leaue you here beyond the seas, As Regent of our Prouinces in Fraunce, While we to England take a speedie course, And thanke our God that gaue vs victorie. Hubert de Burgh take Arthur here to thee, Be he thy prisoner: Hubert keepe him safe, For on his life doth hang thy Soueraignes crowne, But in his death consists thy Soueraignes blisse: Then Hubert, as thou shortly hearst from me, So vse the prisoner I haue giuen in charge. Hubert Frolick yong Prince, though I your keeper bee, Yet shall your keeper liue at your commaund. Arthur As please my God, so shall become of me. Q. Elianor My Sonne to England, I will see thee shipt, And pray to God to send thee safe ashore. Bastard Now warres are done, I long to be at home To diue into the Monkes and Abbots bags, To make some sport among the smooth skin Nunnes, And keepe some reuell with the fanzen Friers. Iohn To England Lords, each looke vnto your charge, And arme yourselues against the Romane pride. Exeunt. Enter the K. of Fraunce, Lewes his sonne, Cardinall Pandolph Legate, and Constance. Philip What euery man attacht with this mishap? Why frowne you so, why droop ye Lords of Fraunce? Me thinkes it differs from a warlike minde To lowre it for a checke or two of chaunce. Had Lymoges escapt the bastards spight, A little sorrow might haue serude our losse. Braue Austria, heauen ioyes to haue thee there. Card. His sowle is safe and free from Purgatorie, Our holy Father hath dispenst his sinnes, The blessed Saints haue heard our orisons, And all are Mediators for his soule, And in the right of these most holy warres, His holines free pardon doth pronounce To all that follow you gainst English heretiques, Who stand accursed in our mother Church. Enter Constance alone. Philip To aggrauate the measure of our griefe, All malcontent comes Constance for her Sonne. Be briefe good Madame, for your face imports A tragick tale behinde thats yet vntolde. Her passions stop the organ of her voyce, Deepe sorrow throbbeth misbefalne euents, Out with it Ladie, that our Act may end A full Catastrophe of sad laments. Const. My tongue is tunde to storie forth mishap: When did I breath to tell a pleasing tale? Must Constance speake? let teares preuent her talke: Must I discourse? let Dido sigh and say, She weepes againe to heare the wrack of Troy: Two words will serue, and then my tale is done: Elnors proud brat hath robd me of my Sonne. Lewes Haue patience Madame, this is chaunce of warre: He may be ransomde, we reuenge his wrong. Constance Beit ner so soone, I shall not liue so long. Philip Despaire not yet, come Constance, goe with me, These clowdes will fleet, the day will cleare againe. Exeunt. Card. Now Lewes, thy fortune buds with happie spring, Our holy Fathers prayers effecteth this. Arthur is safe, let Iohn alone with him, Thy title next is fairst to Englands Crowne: Now stirre thy Father to begin with Iohn, The Pope sayes I, and so is Albion thine. Lewes Thankes my Lord Legate for your good conceipt, Tis best we follow now the game is faire, My Father wants to worke him your good words. Card. A few will serue to forward him in this, Those shal not want: but lets about it then. Exeunt. Enter Philip leading a Frier, charging him to show where the Abbots golde lay. Philip Come on you fat Franciscans, dallie no longer, but shew me where the Abbots treasure lyes, or die. Frier Benedicamus Domini, was euer such an iniurie. Sweete S. Withold of thy lenitie, defend vs from extremitie, And heare vs for S. Charitie, oppressed with austeritie. In nomini Domini, make I my homilie, Gentle Gentilitie grieue not the Cleargie. Philip Grey gownd good face, coniure ye, ner trust me for a groate, If this waste girdle hang thee not that girdeth in thy coate. Now balde and barefoote Bungie birds when vp the gallowes climing, Say Philip he had words inough to put you downe with ryming. Frier A pardon, O parce, Saint Fraunces for mercie, Shall shield thee from nightspells and dreaming of diuells, If thou wilt forgiue me, and neuer more grieue me, With fasting and praying, and Haile Marie saying. From black Purgatorie a penance right sorie. Frier Thomas will warme you, It shall neuer harme you. Philip Come leaue off your rabble, Sirs hang vp this lozell. 2. Frier For charitie I beg his life, Saint Frauncis chiefest Frier, The best in all our Couent Sir, to keepe a Winters fier. O strangle not the good olde man, my hostesse oldest guest, And I will bring you by and by vnto the Priors chest. Philip I, saist thou so, &amp; if thou wilt the frier is at libertie, If not, as I am honest man, Ile hang you both for companie. Frier Come hether, this is the chest though simple to behold That wanteth not a thousand pound in siluer and in gold. My selfe will warrant full so much, I know the Abbots store, Ile pawne my life there is no lesse to haue what ere is more. Philip I take thy word, the ouerplus vnto thy share shall come, But if there want of full so much, thy neck shall pay the sum. Breake vp the Cofer, Frier. Frier Oh I am vndun, faire Alice the Nun Hath tooke vp her rest in the Abbots chest, Sancte benedicite, pardon my simplicitie. Fie Alice, confession will not salue this transgression. Philip What haue wee here, a holy Nun? So keepe mee God in health, A smooth facte Nunne (for ought I knowe) is all the Abbots wealth. Is this the Nonries chastitie? Beshrewe me but I thinke They goe as oft to Uenery, as niggards to their drinke. Why paltrey Frier and Pandar too, yee shamelesse shauen crowne, Is this the chest that held a hoord, at least a thousand pound? And is the hoord a holy whore? Wel be the hangman nimble, Hee'le take the paine to paye you home, and teach you to dissemble. Nunne O spare the Frier Anthony, a better neuer was To sing a Dirige solemnly, or read a morning Masse. If money be the meanes of this, I know an ancient Nunne, That hath a hoord this seauen yeares, did neuer see the sunne; And that is yours, and what is ours, so fauour now be shown, You shall commaund as commonly, as if it were your owne. Frier Your honour excepted. Nunne I Thomas, I meane so. Philip From all saue from Friers. Nunne Good Sir, doo not thinke so? Philip I thinke and see so: why how camst thou here? Frier To hide her from lay men. Nunne Tis true sir, for feare. Philip For feare of the laytie: a pitifull dred When a Nunne flies for succour to a fat Friers bed. But now for your ransome my Cloyster-bred Conney, To the chest that you speake of where lyes so much money. Nunne Faire Sir, within this presse, of plate &amp; money is The valew of a thousand markes, and other thing by gis. Let vs alone, and take it all, tis yours Sir, now you know it. Philip Come on sir Frier, pick the locke, this geere dooth cotton hansome, That couetousnes so cunningly must pay ye letchers ransom. What is in the hoord? Frier Frier Laurence my Lord, now holy water help vs, Some witch, or some diuell is sent to delude vs: Haud credo Laurentius, that thou shouldst be pend thus In the presse of a Nun we are all vndon, And brought to discredence if thou be Frier Laurence, Frier Amor vincit omnia, so Cato affirmeth, And therefore a Frier whose fancie soone burneth: Because he is mortall and made of mould, He omits what he ought, and doth more than he should. Philip How goes this geere? the Friers chest filde with a fausen Nunne, The Nunne again locks Frier vp, to keep him fr? the Sun. Belike the presse is purgatorie, or penance passing grieuous: The Friers chest a hel for Nuns. How do these dolts deceiue vs? Is this the labour of their liues to feede and liue at ease, To reuell so lasciuiously as often as they please. Ile mend the fault or fault my ayme, if I do misse amending, Tis better burn ye cloisters down than leaue th? for offending. But holy you, to you I speake, to you religious diuell, Is this the presse that holdes the summe to quite you for your euill. Nunne I crie Peccaui, parce me, good Sir I was beguild. Frier Absolue Sir for charitie she would be reconcilde. Phi. And so I shall, sirs binde them fast, this is their absoluti?, Go hang them vp for hurting them, hast them to execution. Fr. Lawrence. O tempus edax rerum, Geue children bookes they teare them. O vanitas vanitatis, in this waning ætatis, At threescore welneere to goe to this geere, To my conscience a clog to dye like a dog. Exaudi me Domine, siuis me parce Dabo pecuniam, si habeo veniam To goe and fetch it, I will dispatch it, A hundred pound sterling for my liues sparing. Enter Peter a Prophet, with people. Peter Hoe, who is here, S. Fraunces be your speed, Come in my flock, and follow me, your fortunes I will reed Come hether boy, goe get thee home, and clime not ouerhie: For from aloft thy fortunes stands in hazard thou shalt die. Boy God be with you Peter, I pray you come to our house a Sunday. Peter My boy show me thy hand, blesse thee my boy, For in thy palme I see a many troubles are ybent to dwell, But thou shalt scape them all and doo full well. Boy I thanke you Peter, theres a cheese for your labor: my sister prayes ye to come home, &amp; tell her how many husbands she shall haue, and shee'l giue you a rib of bacon. Peter My masters, stay at the towns end for me, Ile come to you all anon: I must dispatch some busines with a Frier, and then Ile read your fortunes. Philip How now, a Prophet? Sir prophet whence are ye? Peter I am of the world and in the world, but liue not as others by the world: what I am I know, and what thou wilt be I know. If thou knowest me now be answered: if not, enquire no more what I am. Phil. Sir, I know you will be a dissembling knaue, that deludes the people with blinde prophecies: you are him I looke for, you shall away with me: bring away all the rabble, and you Frier Laurence remember your raunsome a hundred pound, and a pardon for your selfe, and the rest come on. Sir Prophet, you shall with me, to receiue a Prophets rewarde. Exeunt. Enter Hubert de Burgh with three men. Hubert My masters, I haue shewed you what warrant I haue for this attempt; I perceiue by your heauie countenances, you had rather be otherwise imployed, and for my owne part, I would the King had made choyce of some other executioner: onely this is my comfort, that a King commaunds, whose precepts neglected or omitted, threatneth torture for the default. Therefore in briefe, leaue me, and be readie to attend the aduenture: stay within that entry, and when you heare me crie, God saue the King, issue sodainly foorth, lay handes on Arthur, set him in this chayre, wherin (once fast bound) leaue him with me to finish the rest. Attendants We goe, though loath. Exeunt. Hubert My Lord, will it please your Honour to take the benefite of the faire euening? Enter Arthur to Hubert de Burgh. Arthur Gramercie Hubert for thy care of me, In or to whom restraint is newly knowen, The ioy of walking is small benefit, Yet will I take thy offer with small thankes, I would not loose the pleasure of the eye. But tell me curteous keeper if you can, How long the King will haue me tarrie heere. Hubert I know not Prince, but as I gesse not long. God send you freedome, and God saue the King, They issue forth. Arthur Why how now sirs, what may this outrage meane? O helpe me Hubert, gentle keeper helpe: God send this sodaine mutinous approach Tend not to reaue a wretched guiltles life. Hubert So sirs, depart, and leaue the rest for me. Arthur Then Arthur yeeld, death frowneth in thy face, What meaneth this? Good Hubert plead the case. Hubert Patience yong Lord, and listen words of woe, Harmfull and harsh, hells horror to be heard: A dismall tale fit for a furies tongue. I faint to tell, deepe sorrow is the sound. Arthur What, must I die? Hubert No newes of death, but tidings of more hate, A wrathfull doome, and most vnluckie fate: Deaths dish were daintie at so fell a feast, Be deafe, heare not, its hell to tell the rest. Arthur Alas thou wrongst my youth with words of feare, Tis hell, tis horror, not for one to heare: What is it man if it must needes be don, Act it, and end it, that the paine were gon. Hubert I will not chaunt such dolour with my tongue, Yet must I act the outrage with my hand. My heart my head, and all my powers beside, To aide the office haue at once denide. Peruse this letter, lines of treble woe, Read ore my charge, and pardon when you know. Hubert these are to commaund thee, as thou tendrest our quiet in minde and the estate of our person, that presently vpon the receipt of our commaund, thou put out the eyes of Arthur Plantaginet. Arthur Ah monstrous damned man, his very breath infects the elements, Contagious venyme dwelleth in his heart, Effecting meanes to poyson all the world. Unreuerent may I be to blame the heauens Of great iniustice, that the miscreant Liues to oppresse the innocents with wrong. Ah Hubert, makes he thee his instrument To sound the tromp that causeth hell triumph? Heauen weepes, the Saints doo shed celestiall teares, They feare thy fall, and cyte thee with remorse, They knock thy conscience, moouing pitie there, Willing to fence thee from the rage of hell: Hell Hubert, trust me all the plagues of hell Hangs on performance of this damned deede. This seale, the warrant of the bodies blisse, Ensureth Satan chieftaine of thy soule: Subscribe not Hubert, giue not Gods part away. I speake not onely for eyes priuiledge, The chiefe exterior that I would enioy: But for thy perill, farre beyond my paine, Thy sweete soules losse, more than my eyes vaine lack; A cause internall, and eternall too. Aduise thee Hubert, for the case is hard, To loose saluation for a Kings reward. Hubert My Lord, a subiect dwelling in the land Is tyed to execute the Kings commaund. Arthur. Yet God commands, whose power reacheth further, That no commaund should stand in force to murther. Hubert But that same Essence hath ordaind a law, A death for guilt, to keepe the world in awe. Arthur I plead not guiltie, treasonles and free. Hubert But that appeale my Lord concernes not me. Arthur Why, thou art he that maist omit the perill. Hubert I, if my Soueraigne would remit his quarrell. Arthur His quarrell is vnhallowed false and wrong. Hubert Then be the blame to whom it doth belong. Arthur Why thats to thee if thou as they proceede, Conclude their iudgement with so vile a deede. Hubert Why then no execution can be lawfull, If Iudges doomes must be reputed doubtfull. Arthur Yes where in forme of Lawe in place and time, The offender is conuicted of the crime. Hubert My Lord, my Lord, this long expostulation, Heapes vp more griefe, than promise of redresse; For this I know, and so resolude I end, That subiects liues on Kings commaunds depend. I must not reason why he is your foe, But doo his charge since he commaunds it so. Arthur Then doo thy charge, and charged be thy soule With wrongfull persecution done this day. You rowling eyes, whose superficies yet I doo behold with eyes that Nature lent: Send foorth the terror of your Moouers frowne, To wreake my wrong vpon the murtherers That rob me of your faire reflecting view: Let hell to them (as earth they wish to mee) Be darke and direfull guerdon for their guylt, And let the black tormenters of deepe Tartary Upbraide them with this damned enterprise, Inflicting change of tortures on their soules. Delay not Hubert, my orisons are ended, Begin I pray thee, reaue me of my sight: But to performe a tragedie indeede, Conclude the period with a mortall stab. Constance farewell, tormentor come away, Make my dispatch the Tirants feasting day. Hubert I faint, I feare, my conscience bids desist: Faint did I say, feare was it that I named? My King commaunds, that warrant sets me free: But God forbids, and he commaundeth Kings, That great Commaunder counterchecks my charge, He stayes my hand, he maketh soft my heart, Goe cursed tooles, your office is exempt, Cheere thee yong Lord, thou shalt not loose an eye, Though I should purchase it with losse of life. Ile to the King, and say his will is done, And of the langor tell him thou art dead, Goe in with me, for Hubert was not borne To blinde those lampes that Nature pollisht so, Arthur Hubert, if euer Arthur be in state, Looke for amends of this receiued gift I tooke my eysight by thy curtesie, Thou lentst them me, I will not be ingrate. But now procrastination may offend The issue that thy kindnes vndertakes: Depart we Hubert to preuent the worst. Exeunt. Enter King Iohn, Essex, Salisbury, Penbrooke. Iohn Now warlike followers resteth ought vndon That may impeach vs of fond ouersight? The French haue felt the temper of our swords, Cold terror keepes possession in their sowles, Checking their ouerdaring arrogance For buckling with so great an ouermatch. The Arche proud titled Priest of Italy, That calles himselfe grand Uiccar vnder God Is busied now with trentall obsequies, Masse and months minde, dirge and I know not what To ease their sowles in painefull purgatory, That haue miscaried in these bloudy warres. Heard you not Lords when first his holines Had tidings of our small account of him, How with a taunt vaunting vpon his toes He vrdge a reason why the English Asse Disdaingd the blessed ordinance of Rome? The title (reuerently might I inferre) Became the Kings that earst haue borne the load, The slauish weight of that controlling Priest: Who at his pleasure temperd them like waxe To carrie armes on danger of his curse, Banding their sowles with warrants of his hand. I grieue to thinke how Kings in ages past (Simply deuoted to the Sea of Rome) Haue run into a thousand acts of shame. But now for confirmation of our State, Sith we haue proynd the more than needfull braunch That did oppresse the true wel-growing stock, It resteth we throughout our Territories Be reproclaimed and inuested King. Pembrook My Liege, that were to busie men with doubts, Once were you crownd, proclaimd, and with applause Your Citie streetes haue ecchoed to the eare, God saue the King, God saue our Soueraigne Iohn. Pardon my feare, my censure doth infer Your Highnes not deposde from Regall State, Would breed a mutinie in peoples mindes, What it should meane to haue you crownd againe. Iohn Pembrooke performe what I haue bid thee doo, Thou knowst not what induceth me to this, Essex goe in, and Lordings all be gon About this taske, I will be crownd anon. Enter the Bastard. Philip, what newes, how doo the Abbots chests? Are Friers fatter than the Nunnes are faire? What cheere with Churchmen, had they golde or no? Tell me how hath thy office tooke effect? Philip My Lord, I haue performd your Highnes charge: The ease bred Abbots and the bare foote Friers, The Monkes the Priors and holy cloystred Nunnes, Are all in health, and were my Lord in wealth, Till I had tythde and tolde their holy hoords. I doubt not when your Highnes sees my prize, You may proportion all their former pride. Iohn Why so, now sorts it Philip as it should: This small intrusion into Abbey trunkes, Will make the Popelings excommunicate, Curse, ban, and breath out damned orisons, As thick as hailestones fore the springs approach: But yet as harmles and without effect, As is the eccho of a Cannons crack Dischargd against the battlements of heauen. But what newes els befell there Philip? Bastard Strange newes my Lord: within your territories, Nere Pomfret is a Prophet new sprong vp, Whose diuination volleys wonders foorth; To him the Commons throng with Countrey gifts, He sets a date vnto the Beldames death, Prescribes how long the Uirgins state shall last, Distinguisheth the moouing of the heauens, Giues limits vnto holy nuptiall rytes, Foretelleth famine, aboundeth plentie forth, Of fate, of fortune, life and death he chats, With such assurance, scruples put apart, As if he knew the certaine doomes of heauen, Or kept a Register of all the Destinies. Iohn Thou telst me meruailes, would thou hadst brought the man, We might haue questiond him of things to come. Bastard My Lord, I tooke a care of had I wist, And brought the Prophet with me to the Court, He stayes my Lord but at the Presence doore: Pleaseth your Highnes, I will call him in. Iohn Nay stay awhile, wee'l haue him here anon, A thing of weight is first to be performd. Enter the Nobles and crowne King Iohn, and then crie God saue the King. Iohn Lordings and friends supporters of our state, Admire not at this vnaccustomd course, Nor in your thoughts blame not this deede of yours. Once ere this time was I inuested King, Your fealtie sworne as Liegmen to our state: Once since that time ambicious weedes haue sprung To staine the beautie of our garden plot: But heauens in our conduct rooting thence The false intruders, breakers of worlds peace, Haue to our ioy, made Sunshine chase the storme. After the which, to try your constancie, That now I see is worthie of your names, We craude once more your helps for to inuest vs Into the right that enuie sought to wrack. Once was I not deposde, your former choyce; Now twice been crowned and applauded King: Your cheered action to install me so, Infers assured witnes of your loues, And binds me ouer in a Kingly care To render loue with loue, rewards of worth To ballance downe requitall to the full. But thankes the while, thankes Lordings to you all: Aske me and vse me, try me and finde me yours. Essex A boon my Lord, at vauntage of your words We aske to guerdon all our loyalties. Pembrooke We take the time your Highnes bids vs aske: Please it you graunt, you make your promise good, With lesser losse than one superfluous haire That not remembred falleth from your head. Iohn My word is past, receiue your boone my Lords. What may it be? Aske it, and it is yours. Essex We craue my Lord, to please the Commons with The libertie of Ladie Constance Sonne: Whose durance darkeneth your Highnes right, As if you kept him prisoner, to the end Your selfe were doubtfull of the thing you haue. Dismisse him thence, your Highnes needes not feare, Twice by consent you are proclaimd our King. Pembrooke This if you graunt, were all vnto your good: For simple people muse you keepe him close. Iohn Your words haue searcht the center of my thoughts, Confirming warrant of your loyalties, Dismisse your counsell, sway my state, Let Iohn doo nothing but by your consents. Why how now Philip, what extasie is this? Why casts thou vp thy eyes to heauen so? There the fiue Moones appeare. Bastard See, see my Lord strange apparitions. Glauncing mine eye to see the Diadem Placte by the Bishops on your Highnes head, From foorth a gloomie cloude, which curtaine like Displaide it selfe, I sodainly espied Fiue Moones reflecting, as you see them now: Euen in the moment that the Crowne was placte Gan they appeare, holding the course you see. Iohn What might portend these apparitions, Unvsuall signes, forerunners of euent, Presages of strange terror to the world: Beleeue me Lords the obiect feares me much. Philip thou toldst me of me of Wizzard late, Fetch in the man to descant of this show. Pembrooke The heauens frowne vpon the sinfull earth, When with prodigious vnaccustomd signes They spot their superficies with such wonder. Essex Before the ruines of Ierusalem, Such Meteors were the Ensignes of his wrath That hastned to destroy the faultfull Towne. Enter the Bastard with the Prophet. Iohn Is this the man? Bastard It is my Lord. Iohn Prophet of Pomfret, for so I heare thou art, That calculatst of many things to come: Who by a power repleate with heauenly gift Canst blab the counsell of thy Makers will. If fame be true, or truth be wrongd by thee, Decide in cyphering what these fiue Moones Portend this Clyme, if they presage at all. Breath out thy gift, and if I liue to see Thy diuination take a true effect, Ile honour thee aboue all earthly men. Peter The Skie wherein these Moones haue residence, Presenteth Rome the great Metropolis, Where sits the Pope in all his holy pompe. Fowre of the Moones present fowre Prouinces, To wit, Spaine, Denmarke, Germanie, and Fraunce, That beare the yoke of proud commaunding Rome, And stand in feare to tempt the Prelates curse. The smallest Moone that whirles about the rest, Impatient of the place he holds with them, Doth figure foorth this Iland Albion, Who gins to scorne the Sea and State of Rome, And seekes to shun the Edicts of the Pope: This showes the heauen, and this I doo auerre Is figured in these apparitions. Iohn Why then it seemes the heauens smile on vs, Giuing applause for leauing of the Pope. But for they chaunce in our Meridian, Doo they effect no priuate growing ill To be inflicted on vs in this Clyme? Peter The Moones effect no more than what I said: But on some other knowledge that I haue By my prescience, ere Ascension day Haue brought the Sunne vnto his vsuall height, Of Crowne, Estate, and Royall dignitie, Thou shalt be cleane dispoyld and dispossest. Iohn False Dreamer, perish with thy witched newes, Uillaine thou woundst me with thy fallacies: If it be true, dye for thy tidings price; If false, for fearing me with vaine suppose: Hence with the Witch, hells damned secretarie. Lock him vp sure: for by my faith I sweare, True or not true, the Wizzard shall not liue. Before Ascension day: who should be cause hereof? Cut off the cause and then the effect will dye. Tut, tut, my mercie serues to maime my selfe, The roote doth liue, from whence these thornes spring vp, I and my promise past for his deliury: Frowne friends, faile faith, the diuell goe withall, The brat shall dye, that terrifies me thus. Pembrooke and Essex I recall my graunt, I will not buy your fauours with my feare: Nay murmur not, my will is law enough, I loue you well, but if I loude you better, I would not buy it with my discontent. Enter Hubert. How now, what newes with thee. Hubert According to your Highnes strickt commaund Yong Arthurs eyes are blinded and extinct. Iohn Why so, then he may feele the crowne, but neuer see it. Hubert Nor see nor feele, for of the extreame paine, Within one hower gaue he vp the Ghost. Iohn What is he dead? Hubert He is my Lord. Iohn Then with him dye my cares. Essex Now ioy betide thy soule. Pembrooke And heauens reuenge thy death. Essex What haue you done my Lord? Was euer heard A deede of more inhumane consequence? Your foes will curse, your friends will crie reuenge. Unkindly rage more rough than Northern winde, To chip the beautie of so sweete a flower. What hope in vs for mercie on a fault, When kinsman dyes without impeach of cause, As you haue done, so come to cheere you with, The guilt shall neuer be cast me in my teeth. Exeunt. Iohn And are you gone? The diuell be your guide: Proud Rebels as you are to braue me so: Saucie, vnciuill, checkers of my will. Your tongues giue edge vnto the fatall knife: That shall haue passage through your traitrous throats. But husht, breath not buggs words to soone abroad, Least time preuent the issue of thy reach. Arthur is dead, I there the corzie growes: But while he liude, the danger was the more; His death hath freed me from a thousand feares, But it hath purchast me ten times ten thousand foes. Why all is one, such luck shall haunt his game, To whome the diuell owes an open shame: His life a foe that leueld at my crowne, His death a frame to pull my building downe. My thoughts harpt still on quiet by his end, Who liuing aymed shrowdly at my roome: But to preuent that plea twice was I crownd, Twice did my subiects sweare me fealtie, And in my conscience loude me as their liege, In whose defence they would haue pawnd their liues. But now they shun me as a Serpents sting, A tragick Tyrant sterne and pitiles, And not a title followes after Iohn. But Butcher, bloudsucker and murtherer, What Planet gouernde my natiuitie, To bode me soueraigne types of high estate, So interlacte with hellish discontent, Wherein fell furie hath no interest. Curst be the Crowne chiefe author of my care, Nay curst my will that made the Crowne my care: Curst be my birthday, curst ten times the wombe That yeelded me aliue into the world. Art thou there villaine, Furies haunt thee still, For killing him whom all the world laments. Hubert Why heres my Lord your Highnes hand &amp; seale, Charging on liues regard to doo the deede. Iohn Ah dull conceipted peazant knowst thou not, It was a damned execrable deede: Showst me a seale? Oh villaine, both our soules Haue solde their freedome to the thrall of hell, Under the warrant of that cursed seale. Hence villaine, hang thy selfe, and say in hell That I am comming for a kingdome there. Hubert My Lord attend the happie tale I tell, For heauens health send Sathan packing hence That instigates your Highnes to despaire. If Arthurs death be dismall to be heard, Bandie the newes for rumors of vntruth: He liues my Lord, the sweetest youth aliue, In health, with eysight, not a haire amisse. This hart tooke vigor from this forward hand, Making it weake to execute your charge. Iohn What liues he? Then sweete hope come hom agen, Chase hence despaire, the purueyer for hell. Hye Hubert, tell these tidings to my Lords That throb in passions for yong Arthurs death: Hence Hubert, stay not till thou hast reueald The wished newes of Arthurs happy health. I goe my selfe, the ioyfulst man aliue To storie out this new supposed crime. Exeunt. The ende of the first part.</field>
