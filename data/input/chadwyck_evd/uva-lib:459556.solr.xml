      <field name="fulltext">JESUS Brethren, goe we to Bethenye to Lazarre, Martha, and Marye; for I love mych that companye, thidder now will I wend. Symon the lepper hath prayed me in his house to take charitie. With them nowe yt liketh mee a while for to lend. PETRUS Lord, all readye shall we be in life and death to goe with thee. Great joye they may have to see thy comminge into there place. PHILIPPUS Lazarre thou raysed through thy pittye, and Simon alsoâmesell was heeâ thou clensed, lord, that wotten we, and holpe them through thy grace. Tunc ibunt versus domum Simonis leprosi. SIMON Welcome, Jesu, full of grace, that mee that fowle and mesell was all whole, lord, thou healed hase, over all for to showe. Well is me that I may see thy face here in my house, this poore place. Thou comfortes me in manye a case and that I full well knowe. LAZARUS Welcome, lord, sweete Jesu. Blessed be the tyme that I thee knewe. From death to life through thy vertue thou raysed me not yore. Fowre dayes in yearth when I had layne thou grantest me life, lord, agayne. Thee I honour with all my mayne nowe and evermore. MARTHA Welcome, my lovely lord and leere; welcome, my deareworth darlinge deare. Fayne may thy freindes be in feere to se thy freelye face. Syttes downe, if your will weare, and I shall helpe to serve you here as I was wonte in good manere before in other place. Tunc Jesus sedebat, et omnes cum eo, et veniet Maria Magdalena cum alablastro unguenti, et lamentando dicat. MARIA MAGDALENA Welcome, my lovely lord of leale; welcome, my harte; welcome, my heale; welcome, all my worldes weale, my boote and all my blys. From thee, lord, may I not conceale my fylth and my faultes fayle. Forgive mee that my flesh so frayle to thee hath donne amysse. Oyntment I have here readye to anoynte thy sweete bodye. Though I be wretched and unworthye, wayve me not from thy wonne. Full of synne and sorrowe am I, but therfore, lord, I am sorye. Amend me through thy mercye, that makes to thee my monne. Tunc aperiet pixidem, et faciet signum unctionis, et rigabit pedes Jesu lachrymis et tergebit capillis suis. SIMON A, Judas, why doth Jesus soe? Methinke that hee should lett her goe, this woman full of synne and woe, for feare of worldes shame. And if hee verey prophet were, hee should knowe hir life here and suffer her not to come him nere, for payringe of his fame. JUDAS ISCARIOTH Naye, Simon, brother, sooth to saye, hit is nothinge to my paye; this oyntment goeth to fast awaye that is so mych of pryce. This ylke boyst might have binne sould for three hundreth penyes tould and dealt to poore men, whosoever would, and whosoever had binne wise. JESUS Simon, take good heed to mee. I have an errand to saye to thee. SIMON Maister, what you will maye bee, saye on, I you beseech. JESUS By an example I shall thee showe and to this companye on a rowe, whereby I say thou may knowe to answere to my speache. Two detters somtyme there were oughten money to a userer. The on was in his dangere five hundreth penyes tould; they other fiftie, as I saye here. For they were poore, at there prayer he forgave them both in feare, and nought take of them he would. Whether of these two, read if thou can, was more behoulden to that man? SIMON Lord, as much as I can thereon I shall saye or I passe. Five hundreth is more then fiftie; therfore methinke skylfullye that hee that hee forgave more partie, more houlden to him he was. JESUS Simon, thou deemes soothlie, iwysse. Sees thou this woman that here is? Sycker shee hath not donne amysse to worke on this manere. Into thy house here thou me geete; no water thou gave mee to my feete. Shee washed them with her teares weete and wyped them with her heare. Kisse syth I came thou gave non, but syth shee came into this wonne shee hath kyssed my feete eychon; of weepinge shee never ceased. With oyle thou hast not me anoynt, but shee hat donne both foot and joynt. Therfore I tell thee on poynt, mych synne is her released. Ad Judam Iscarioth: And Judas, also to thee I saye: wherto wouldest thee mispaye with this woman by any waye that eased me this hasse? A good deede shee hath donne todaye, for poore men you have with you aye, and me yee may not have, in faye, but a little space. Therfore, woman, witterlye, for thou hast loved so tenderly, all thy synnes nowe forgive I; beleeffe hath saved thee. And all that preach the evangelye through the world by and by of thy deed shall make memorye that thou hasse donne to mee. MARIA MAGDALENA My Christ, my comfort and my kinge, I worshippe thee in all thinge, for nowe my hart is in likinge, and I at myne above. Seaven devills nowe, as I well see, thou hast dryven nowe owt of mee, and from fowle life unto great lee releeved me, lord, for love. Tunc surget Jesus, et stando dicat ut sequitur: JESUS Peter and Phillipe, my brethren free, before you a castle you may see. Goe you thider and fetch anon to mee an asse and a foale alsoe. Loose them, bringe them hither anone. Yf any man grytch you as yee gonne, and you say that I will ryde thereon, soone will they let them goe. PETRUS Maister, we shall doe your byddinge and bringe them soone for anythinge. Phillippe, brother, be we goinge and fetch these beastes too. PHILLIPPUS Brother, I am readye bowne. Hye that we were at the towne. Great joye in hart have we mone on this arrand for to goe. Tunc ibunt in civitatem, et dicat Petrus Janitro: How, how! I must have this asse. JANITOR Here thou gettest neither more then lesse but thou tell me or thou passe whither they shall goe. PHILLIPPUS My maister Jesu, leeve thou mee, thinkes to come to this cittie and bade both brought to him should bee, himselfe to ryde upon. JANITOR All readye, good men, in good faye! And syth hee will come todaye, all this cittie I will saye and warne of his comynge. Take asse and foale and goe your waye, for eyche man of him marvayle maye. Lazarre, that fowre daye dead laye, hee raysed at his callinge. Tunc ibit Janitor ad cives. Tydinges, good men evrye one! The prophet Jesus comes anone. Of his disciples, yonder gonne twayne that were nowe here. For his marvayles leeve aye upon that hee is verey Goddes Sonne although hee in this wonneâ for elles wonder were. PRIMUS CIVIS A, lord, blessed most thou bee! Him will I goe nowe and see; and so I read that all wee thidderward take the waye. SECUNDUS CIVIS Fellowes, I leeve that Christ is hee, commen from God in majestie; elles such marveyles, as thinkes mee, hee ney did daye for daye. TERTIUS CIVIS Lazarre he raysed, as God me save, that foure dayes hath binne in grave. Therfore devotion nowe I have to welcome him to this towne. QUARTUS CIVIS Branches of the palme tree eycheon in hand take wee, and welcome him to this cittie with fayre processionn. QUINTUS CIVIS With all the worshippe that I maye I welcome him will todaye, and spread my clothes in the waye as soone as I him see. SEXTUS CIVIS These miracles preeven appertlye that from the Father almightie hee is commen, mankynd to bye; yt may not other bee. PRIMUS PUER Fellowes, I hard my father saye Jesu the prophet will come todaye. Thidder I read we take the waye with branches in our hand. SECUNDUS PUER Make wee myrth all that we maye pleasant to that lordes paye. âHosanna!â I read, by my faye, to synge that we founde. Tunc ibunt pueri versus Jerusalem cantantes âHosanna!â cum ramis palmarum in manibus. Et cives prosternent vestimenta sua in via: âHosanna, filio David! Benedictus qui venit in nomine domini! Hosanna in excelsis!â Tunc Jesus sedens super asellam, videns civitatem, flebit et dicat. JESUS A, Jerusalem, holye cittie! Unknowne todaye yt is to thee that peace thou hastâthou canst not seeâ but bale thou shalt abyde. Mych must thou dreigh yet some daye when woe shall fall on everye waye, and thou begyled, sooth to saye, with sorrowe one all syde; destroyed, dilfullye dryven downe. Noe stone with other in all this towne shall stand, for that they be unlevon to keepe Christes commen and Goddes owne visitation, donne for mankyndes salvation; for the have no devotyon, ne dreiden not his dome. Tunc Jesus equitabit versus civitatem, et omnes cives pannos suos in via prosternent. Et cum venerit ad templum, descendens de asina dicat vendentibus, cum flagello: Doe awaye, and use not this thinge, for hit is not my likinge. You make my Fathers wonnynge a place of marchandize. PRIMUS MERCATOR What freake is this that makes this fare and casteth downe all our warre? Come no man hither full yare that did us such anoye. SECUNDUS MERCATOR Owt, owt, woe is mee! My table with my money is spread abroade, well I see, and nought dare I saye. Nowe yt seemes well that hee would attayne royaltee; elles this bould durst hee not bee to make such araye. PRIMUS MERCATOR Hit seemes well hee would be kinge that casteth downe thus our thinges and sayes his Fathers wonninge in this temple is. Saye, Jesus, with thy janglinge, what evidence or tokeninge shewest thow of thy rayninge, that thou darest doe this? SECUNDUS MERCATOR What signes nowe shewest thou here that preeves such power to shend our ware in such manere, maisterlye through thy mayne? JESUS This temple here I maye destroye, and through my might and my maistrye in dayes three hit edifie and buyld yt up agayne. PRIMUS MERCATOR Aha, Jesu, wilt thou soe? Thys worde, as ever mote I goe, shalbe rehearsed before moe. Cayphas I shall tell. Tunc Jesus ejiciet cum flagello ementes et vendentes. JESUS Hye you fast this temple froe, for marchandize shall be here noe more. In this place, be you never soe throe, shall you no lenger dwell. JUDAS ISCARIOTH By deare God in majestie, I am as wroth as I may be, and some waye I will wreake mee as soone as ever I maye. My maister Jesu, as men might see, was rubbed head, foote, and knee with oyntment of more dayntee then I see many a daye. To that I have great envye, that hee suffered to destroye more then all his good thrye, and his dammes too. Had I of yt had maistrye, I would have sould yt soone in hie and put hit up in treasurye as I was wont to doe. Whatsoever was given to Jesu I have kept syns I him knewe; for hee hopes I be trewe, his pursse I alwaye beare. Him had binne better, in good faye, had spared oyntment that daye, for wroken I wilbe some waye of waste that was donne there. Three hundeth penyes-worth yt was that hee lett spill in that place. Therfore God give me hard grace but himselfe shalbe sould to the Jewes, or that I sytt, for the tenth penye of hit; and thus my maister shalbe quytte my greeffe an hundrethfould. Syr Cayphas and his companye conspyrne Jesus to anoye. There speech anon I will espye, with falsshood for to fowle him. And if the gladlye will do whye, I shall teach them to him in hye, for of his counsell well knowe I. I may best beguyle him. Tunc Judas pro tempore abiit, et Cayphas dicit. CAYPHAS Lordinges, lookers of the lawe, herkyns hether to my sawe. To Jesu all men can drawe and likinge in him hase. If we letten him longe gonne, all men will leeve him upon; so shall the Romanes come anon and pryve us of our place. Therfore yt is fullye my readd we cast howe hee best were dead; for yf hee longe on life be leade our lawe goeth all to nought. Therfore saye eychon his counsell, what manere of waye will best avayle this ylke shrewe for to assayleâ some sleyght there must be sought. ANNAS Syr, you saye right skylfullye; but needesly men must espie by him we catch noe vilanye, to fownd and fowle to fayle. For you knowe as well as I, oft we have fownded to do him anoye; but ever he hath the victoryeâ that noe waye maye avayle. PRIMUS PHARASEUS Yea, syr, in temple hee hath binne and troubled us with mych teene, that when we wended and did weene of him to have had all our will, or ever we wist, he was awaye. This maketh the people, in good faye, to leeve that hee is Christ vereye, and our lawe for to spill. SECUNDUS PHARASEUS Yea, lordes, one poynt may doe gayne. That lourden, Lazarre, should be slayne, for he raysed him up agayne that foure dayes had binne dead. For that miracle mych of mayne, to honour him eychon is fayne; and Lazarre, that dead was, will not layne, and hee one life be leade. CAYPHAS Noe more, forsooth, will many moe that hee hase made to speake and goe; and blynd that have theire sight alsoe loven him steadfastlye and followen him both farre and neare, preachinge to the people his powere. Therfore my witt is in a weare to ordayne remedye. ANNAS And remedye must ordayned be before this great solempnitie, or elles may other as well as we trusse and take our waye. For when hee comes to this cittie, all the world, as you might see, honored him upon there knee as God had comon that daye. PRIMUS PHARASEUS Alsoe, lordinges, you sawe there how that he fared with chaffereâ cast hit downe, God give him care, that was so great of price! And alsoe lowdlye hee can lyeâ called the temple apertlye his Fathers house full falslye, right as yt had binne his! SECUNDUS PHARASEUS Lordinges, there is noe more to sayeâ but loost is owr lawe, I dare laye, and hee come one our saboath daye that nowe aprocheth nye. Heale he any, lesse or more, all men will leeve on his lore. Therfore yt is good to slea him before, yf that wee will be slye. CAYPHAS Amonge our wittes lett us see to take him with some subteltye. Hee shall have sylver, gould, and fee, this thinge that would fulfill. JUDAS Lordes, what will you give mee and I shall soone helpe that hee sleelye betrayed bee, right at your owne will? CAYPHAS Welcome, fellowe, as have I roo. That bargayne fayne would I goe too. JUDAS Lett me see what ye will doe, and laye downe sylver here. For the devill swappe of my swyre and I doe yt without hyre, other for soveraigne or syreâ yt is not my manere. CAYPHAS Saye on what we shall give thee to helpe that he taken bee; and here is readye thy moneye to paye thee or thou passe. JUDAS As ever mote I thrive or thee, and I shewe my subtilltye, thirtie penyes yee shall give mee and not a farthinge lasse. PRIMUS PHARISEUS Yea, but thy trueth thou must plight for to serve us aright to betraye thy maister through thy might, and have here thy money. JUDAS Have here my trueth, as I have tight, or Fridaye that hit be night I shall bringe you to his sight and tell which is hee. PRIMUS PHARISEUS Yee binne brethren on a rowe. Which is he I cannot knowe. JUDAS Noe. A verey signe I shall you showe. Aspies whom I kysse, and that is hee, sooth to saye. Takes him manlye, as you maye, and lead him sleelye awaye whither your likinge ys. CAYPHAS Nowe looke thou serve us truely, thy maysters comminge to espie. JUDAS Trust well therto and sickerlye that he shall not eschewe. And would God almightie the kinge of France might so afye in this realme and baronye that they were all so treu! On Fridaye in the morninge espies all on my comminge, for where that he is walkinge I will goe and espie. With him I thinke to eate and drinke and after, tydinges to you to bringe where he shapes his dwellinge, and come and tell you in hye. Finis</field>
