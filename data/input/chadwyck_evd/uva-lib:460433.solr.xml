Whose Tragick Muse the Latian Scene did raise, And Vy'd with the Greek Drama for the Bayes. Buskind Philosophy and made the Stage A Schoole of Virtue to the Vicious Age; His Pen, as Counsels to Brave Ends inclind, Romes Greatness These, Its Goodness This Defind.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To the Blooming Virtues Of the Hopeful Infancy of Richard Francis Sherburne, Esq; Son and Heir-Apparent of The Honourable Sir Nicolas Sherburne, of Stony-Hurst in the County-Palatine of Lancaster, Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Sir Edw. Sherburne, Kt, ON Our Mutual Friendship, and his Ingenious and Learned Labours. Dear Friend! I question, nor can yet decide Whether thou more art my Delight or Pride? O my Defence, and choicest Ornament! Whose Flame inspires me now my own is spent. Kind was the Storm, and the Times furious Rage Did both to shelter in one Port ingage. By Fortune our Acquaintance there begot, Confirm'd by Chance, up into Friendship shot. Our willing Spirits quickly understood The double Tye of Sympathy and Blood. Thy Share of publick Griefs thou didst allay By Conversation then with Seneca. That great Philosopher who had design'd To Life the various Passions of the Mind, Did wrong'd Medea's Jealousie prefer To entertain the Roman Theater. Both to instruct the Soul and please the Sight, At once begetting Horror and Delight. This Cruelty thou didst at once express, Tho in a strange no less becoming Dress; And her Revenge did'st rob of half its Pride, To see it self thus by it self out-vy'd. Nor was't enough t'afford his Scenes this Due, But what thou gav'st to us, as kindly too Thou would'st bestow on him, nor wer't more just Unto the Author's Work than to his Dust. Thou did'st make good his Title, aid his Claim, Both vindicate his Poems and his Name; So shar'st a double Wreath; for all that we Unto the Poet ow, he ows to thee. The Learn'd what we assert must needs confess, Reading Medea, PhÃ¦dra, Troades. Tho Change of Tongues stoln Praise to some afford, Thy Versions have not borrow'd, but restor'd. Next I remember well thou didst distil The Prose of Seneca through thy smooth Quill, Into soft Numbers, such as might prefer The Poet, high as the Philosopher. And thy great Master was well pleas'd to see His Sufferings chose to grace good Mens, by thee. He dead, thou didst withdraw from Town, an Air More innocent, chusing with me to share. Begg'ring the Place guilty of Royal Blood, By bringing from it a large Stock of Good. There, thy Retirement suiting with thy strain, Antient and modern Poets entertain; And, lest such Strangers should converse alone, Thou civilly mix'dst with their Songs thy own. Till ravish'd thence by a Desire to view The happy Regions where those Lawrels grew. Then having gather'd all the learned Store Which scatter'd lay in several Lands before, Back to thy longing Country didst thou come, And gratefully unlade thy Freight at home. To this great End, Manilius, who had long The Spheres oblig'd and rival'd by his Song, Was chosen by his thankful Stars to be The Subject of a sweeter Harmony. But first, (as to great Seneca before) The Author to his Work thou didst restore; And Marcus, if not noble, free at least, Of what the Bond-man seiz'd is re-possest. His Poem then thou didst sing o'er again, In such a noble yet so sweet a Strain, As might at once his Pride and Envy raise, To hear himself out-sung in his own Lays. Yet, as in Rivers where they smiling creep Gently along, the Waters are most deep; All who till now on the smooth Surface sail'd, To fathom the vast Depth despair'd or fail'd. This thou hast done; whose Notes like Sea-marks stand To guide us to the new-discover'd Land. Upon the Author's Triumph, all the rest Attend, who e'er Astronomy profess'd. Of whom the most obscure are proud to be Crown'd by thy hand with Immortality; And they who were from Death secur'd by Fame, Congratulate th'Accession of thy Name. Tho. Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sit Medea ferox invictaque. âHor. de Arte Poet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. MEDEA Sola. Ye Nuptial Powers! Thou who the Genial Bed Guard'st O Lucina! Thou, by whose Rules led, Tiphys the bold Subduer of the Main, Learnt the first Ship to guide as with a Rein. Dread Soveraign of the Seas! thou ever bright PhÅbus, who to the world divid'st thy light. Three-formed Hecate! that dost display On nightly Mysteries thy conscious Ray; And all ye Gods by whom false Jason swore! Or you, Medea, rather should implore Dark Chaos! deeps Infernal! damned souls! The King who Hells sad Monarchy controuls, And Queen with better Faith was Ravish'd; hear! Hear whilst we imprecate! and ye severe Scourgers of Guilt, Eumenides! with Hands All bloody, grasping your Sulphureous Brands, With snaky Curls, and squalid Looks, appear As horrid, at our Nuptials as you were. Death on the new-made Bride, on Corinths King, And our own Progeny, untimely bring. And with some Imprecation yet more dire, 'Gainst my false Husband, my fell Mind inspire. Live he; through unknown Cities helpless roam, A fearful Exile, without House or Home. Wish me his Wife again; Harbour, distrest, From Strangers crave; already a known Guest. And, than which, none a greater curse can be, Children beget he like himself, and me. See! our Revenge does on our Wish attend; These we have born: Complaints in vain we spend, Why rush we not upon our Foes, and there The Bridal Tapers from the Bearers tear, Extinguish them, and bury all in Night? Behold'st thou this, thou Fountain of all light, PhÅbus the radiant Author of our Race; And driv'st through Crystal Skies, thy wonted space? Run'st thou not back unto the East, and Day Remeasur'st? O! to me resign thy sway; Give me the Guidance of those burning Reins That rule the Coursers with the fiery Manes, I'd scourge till Corinth, whose small Land divides Two opposit Seas, and breaks their batt'ring Tides, Consum'd in Flames, should make them way to joyn. Nought rests to do; but that a Nuptial Pine We bear; and when the holy Pray'rs, and all The Rites are done, then, that our Victims fall. Through thine own Bowels reach at thy Revenge, Soul, if thou liv'st, all Womanish Fears estrange, Let thy stout mind on her old strength presume, And more than Scythian Ferity assume. What Ills once Colchos, now shall Corinth see, Horrid, unperpetrated Cruelty, Terror to Men and Gods, works in my Mind; Wounds, Death, spred Funerals of Limbs disjoyn'd; Pish! what slight, trivial Ills do we recount? Acts of our Virgin hands: Our Rage should mount; Ills more sublime, more horrid Acts of Blood Suit with our married state, and Motherhood. Courage then: On, to act thy Tragedy With all thy Fury; that Posterity Thy fatal Nuptials and Divorce may find Equally signal;âStay; thou rash of mind! Thy spouse by what means leav'st thou?âby the same I once did follow him: banish fond shame; Nor waste in dull Delays thy vengeful Plot; Be quick! by Ills leave, what by Ills we got. CHORUS Of Corinthian Women, Singing an Epithalamium to the Nuptials of Jason and Creusa. Ye Gods, whose Empire in the skies, Or in the tumid Ocean lies! These Princely Nuptials, bless we pray, Whilst holy Honours for the Day The duly-favouring People pay. First to those Powers that Thunder fling, And Scepters bear, for Offering A Bull, white without spot, shall die, A Heifer that did never try The servile Yoke, than snow more white, Thee, O Lucina! does delight. To her, who Mars his bloody hands, Do's manacle in peaceful Bands, Who strifes of Nations do's compose, Whose Horn with growing plenty flows, Shall fall a gentler Sacrifice. And thou who these Solemnities, And Rites legitimate dost grace, And the nights sullen darkness chase With thy auspicious hand, come drown'd In Wine, thy Head with Roses crown'd. And thou bright Star, with silver Ray, Fore-runner of the Night, and Day; That slow to those dost still return, Who with Loves mutual Flames do burn. Mothers that long, Daughters new wed Wish thee thy early Beams to spread. 'Mong the Cecropian Dames, the Pride For Beauty, veil unto the Bride The Virgins of the Walless Town Who on Taygetus his Crown, Themselves (as is their Countries guise) In manly Pastimes exercise. And those their limbs in Dirce lave Or in Alpheus sacred Wave. To the Ãsonian Youth, for Grace And Form, shall Bacchus self give place, Who to the Yoke fierce Tygers chains, Or he who o're the Tripods reigns, Mild Brother to the sterner Maid. The Swan-got Twins fair Leda laid, Castor, with Pollux who for blow Of weighty CÃ¦stus all out-go, Yield to Ãsonides the day. So, so CÃ¦lestial powers we pray, All Wives excel the Beauteous Bride, The Bride-groom pass all Men beside. When with the Virgin Choir she joins Her Look 'bove all with Lustre shines. So when the Sun his Beams displays, The Splendour of the Stars decays. So fade the Pleiades, scarce seen, When with her borrow'd Shine, Night's Queen Inorbs her Crescent, so to th'Eye White blushes with PhÅnician Dye. So when Day dawns, Sol's ruddy Light Shews to the Dew-wet Shepherds Sight. From Phasis horrid Bed releast, Wont with unwilling hand, the Breast To touch of such a barbarous Bride, With Parents wills first ratifi'd, Now happy Wed a Grecian Dame. Now Youths with Taunts permissive, Game And in loose Rhimes chant sportive words, Rare is this Licence 'gainst your Lords. Fair Issue of the God of Wine, 'Tis time to light thy carved Pine: With Wine-wet Fingers, then put out The solemn Flame; whilst all the Rout With mirthful Jollity do's ring, And the Fescennine Youths do sing Their Festive Flouts; she want these Rites, And Grace of Hymeneal Lights, Who as a Fugitive shall wed Her self unto a Forein Bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter MEDEA, and her NURSE. MEDEA. Oh! I am slain; the Hymeneal's Sound Hath pierc'd my Ears, and giv'n my Heart a Wound. The Ill I suffer, I scarce yet believe. And thus could Jason cause Medea grieve? When from my Father, Countrey, Crown, and State H' had brought me, thus, to leave me desolate In a strange Land; could he our Merits slight? Cruel, and thankless Wretch! whose pow'rful Might Seas Rage, he saw, and Force of Flames out-went? Thinks he then all our stock of Mischief spent? Perplex'd and wav'ring, my unquiet Mind Labours, which way she may her Vengeance find. Would Heav'ns he had a Brother! Stay; a Wife He has; let's then attempt against her Life, Full Compensation for all Injuries. If Greek, or Barbarous Towns, (in Villanies Skilled) have known a Mischief, such as thou Medea, yet nee'r knew'st, or practic'dst, now, Now attempt the like. Let thy Resolves find Counsel from thy own Ills; call to thy mind The signal Glory of the Colchian Crown Made prize; thy Brother's Limbs dissected, thrown About the Seas; sad Funeral to his Sire! Think on old Pelias boiling o'er the Fire. How oft have we spilt guiltless Blood? yet ne'er Did we act Ills in Rage; Love's Rage we bear. 'Las what could Jason do, at the dispose Of a Superiour Power?âHis Breast oppose T'a Murthering Sword.âAh! better Words afford My passionate Griefs; rather, so Fates accord, May he live still my Jason as before. If not, yet may he live; mindful of poor Medea, to whose Love his Life's a Debt. The Fault was wholly Creons: by whose great O'er-ruling Power, our Marriage-bands he brake; He did the Mother from her Children take, He cancell'd our strict-plighted Faith; He, he, The Butt of our deserved Vengeance be. Ill bury his proud Palace in a high Heap of Ashes, whilst the black Clouds that flie Of Flame-driv'n Smoak, Malea shall amaze Which storm-beat Vessels puts to long delays. Nu. For love of Heav'n be silent, and restrain Passion to recluse Sorrow; âwho sustain âWrongs that oppress 'em, with a quiet Mind âAnd unmov'd Thoughts, know best the way to find âHow to repay 'em. Anger kills, conceal'd; âHates miss of their Revenge, when once reveal'd. Me. âThat Grief's but small which Counsel can oe'r-sway; I'll meet all Opposites. Nu. Thy Fury stay Dear Daughter; scarce a still Retiredness Secure thee can, open Attemps much less, Me. âFortune the Valiant fears; but tramples on âThe coward Soul. Nu. âThen Resolution âIs good, when the Attempt is possible. Me. âWhat âTo Courage, and a Mind resolv'd, is not? Nu. âNo Hope a Remedy t'a lost Affair âDo's shew. Me. âWho nought can hope, should nought despair. Nu. The Colchians hate thee, in thy Spouse no Faith There is; of all thy vast store, Fortune hath Not left thee ought. Me. Yes, here's Medea still, Here Seas, Earth, Fire, Gods, Thunder, what can kill As well as Steel, behold. Nu. Th'incensed Ire O'th' King yet's to be fear'd Me. What was our Sire? Nu. Fear'st thou not force of Arms? Me. Not tho from Earth They sprung, and took from thence their hostile Birth. Nu. Thou'lt suffer Death. Me. 'Tis that we wish. Nu. Be led At my Request to flie. Me. That I e'er fled I grieve; Medea flie! Nu. Think what thou art A Mother. Me. Yes, by whom, you see. Nu. To part Hence doubt'st thou? Me. No; we'll go, but first revenge. Nu. Th'Avenger will pursue Me. It will be strange If we not find him obstacles. Nu. Suppress These Menaces, rash Woman, and redress Thy Pertinacious Thoughts; comply with Fate. Me. Fortune may ravish from me my Estate, My mind she never can. But heark! I hear The Palace Doors to creek; who is't draws near? 'Tis Creon, the proud Tyrant, Creon, high Elated with Pelasgian Royalty. Scene II. Enter CREON. Yet does Ãeta's noxious Issue stay Within our Confines? not yet gone away? Something she machinates; whom all do brand For Noted Fraud, and a Nefarious Hand; Whom spares she? whom, suffers secure to rest? T'extirpate by the Sword this worst of Pest We once resolv'd; th'Intreaties of our Son- In-law prevail'd; and our Concession Got, that she might live; on terms she quit Our Realms from future Fears: with Looks that threat, And truculent Aspect. She 'gins to bend This way her steps, as tho she did intend Some speech with us; Our Guard there! Hence, Away With her, nor suffer her to speak; t'obey A King's Command, once let her learn; with speed Dispatch, and send the Monster gone. Me. What Deed? What Crime of ours mulct you by flight? Cre. A Cause The Innocent Soul demands! Me. âIf by the Laws âYou govern, 'fore you judge, first understand. âIf by your Will alone you rule, command. Cre. Dispute not; 'tis our Pleasure, right or wrong. And thou shalt suffer't. Me. âUnjust Scepters, long âContinue not. Cre. Away; to Colchos, hie To your own home again. Me. Most willingly, So he that brought me thence, return with me. Cre. Your Wishes come too late to our Decree. Me. âWho ought Decrees, one side unheard; tho he âWhat's equal judg, acts without Equity. Cre. Old Pelias ru'd for lending thee an Ear, But speak; and your Egregious Cause let's hear. Me. How ill appeased is the Wrath of Kings, And what a Pride in Royal Fancy springs, Their first-fix'd Resolutions to pursue, From our own Princely Thoughts w' have learn'd too true. For tho with sad Calamity opprest, Scorn'd, suppliant, out-cast, ev'ry way distrest W' are now, we once, in Royal State did shine, And from bright Sol drew our Illustrious Line What Phasis in his winding Arms do's close, What e'er behind the Scythian Pontus shows, Where the Salt Waves grow fresh with floud-mixt Streams, All that extent of Land, whose Borders hems The silver Thermodon; in trampled Fields, Where widow'd Troops display their luned Shields, My Father with Imperial Sceptre sways. In Joys of Royalty, and happy Days. There flourish'd we; Our Marriage-bed those sought Whom now, we seek: But Fortune, light as Thought, From us those Sceptred Glories having rent, Hath now expos'd us to sad Banishment. âIn Crowns, confide! whose Wealth Chance do's transfer âAt Pleasure; But this yet, what no day e'er âCan take from them, Kings, great, and glorious have, âTo help th'Afflicted, and the Suppliant save. This only from our Colchian Realms, away We brought, that by our Favour, we can say The Flower of Greece, and Princely Ornament, Achaia's chiefest Strength, the high Descent Of Gods, were sav'd from Death. Orpheus whose Song Charms stony Rocks, and draws the Woods along, Is our free Gift; that Leda's Twins survive Our double Bounty is; by us do live The Sons of Boreas, Lynceus, he whose Sight Extends cross Pontus its emitted Light, And all the MinyÃ¦, by our Favour, were Preserv'd from Ruin: not to mention here The Chief of all those Chiefs; whose Safety we Reckon no Debt, to none imputed be. To you the rest, to us, this one we brought Away: Inveigh your worst then, count each Fault Of ours, of all this only can you blame, ArgÃ²s return: yet if our Virgin Shame, And Love of Father, had not stoop'd to Love Of Jason, (whom 'fore these we did approve) The Chief of Greece had perish'd, and your Son To ruin, on Bulls flaming Breaths had run. Fortune our Cause m' oppress, (tho undeserv'd) Yet shall we ne'er repent to have preserv'd The Off-spring of so many Kings: With you, Of all our Crime is the Reward, and Due. Condemn us so you please; but first the Crime Declare: W' are guilty; true: So were, what time Creon thy Knees we touch'd, and did implore The Faith of thy protecting Hand. No more Ask we at present, but some place obscure, Where we our selves and Sorrows may immure: If from this City banish'd by your Doom, Within your Realms, afford us yet a Room. Cre. That we with Rigor rule not, nor with high Pride, trample upon humbled Misery, Sufficient Proof we seem in this t'have shown By such a Son-in-law electing; One Exil'd, afflicted, terrifi'd with Fears. For thee the young Acastus, who now wears Thessalia's Crown, seeks with Death-threatning Ire, T'avenge the Murder of his Aged Sire, And his dissected Parents Limbs; when by Thy false Suggestions led, too credulously, The perpetration of so foul a Fact, The pious Sisters impiously did act. Wave thine, and Jason can his Cause maintain, No Guilt of Blood his guiltless Hands did stain, Nor touch of wicked Steel; far from thy dire Counsels, he still innocuous did retire. But thou, vile Machinatrix of all Ills, Whom wom'anish Spleen, and manly Courage steels For all Attempts, regardless of thy Fame, Be gone, and purge our Realms of such a shame. Hence your letiferous Simples take; from Fear Free our perplexed Subjects, and elsewhere With thy Complaints vex Heav'n. Me. To be gone Compel y'us? or Ship, or a Companion Afford; why us alone, command you hence? Alone we came not; or if your pretence Be Fear of War, expel us both; 'twixt two Equally guilty, why distinguish you? To him, not us fell Pelias; add our Flight, Our Kingdom's Prize, our Sire deserted quite, Our Brother piece-meal torn, or if beside A Crime there be he teach to his new Bride 'Tis his, not ours: and tho so often prest To ill, 'twas ne'er for our own Interest. Cre. 'Tis fit th'wert gone; why spin'st thou out Delays In Talk? Me. Vouchsafe thy parting Suppliant prays, This last Request; Let not the Mother's Fault Be as a Guilt upon her Children brought. Cre. Go, go, we'll guard these with a Father's Care. Me. By these more happy Nuptials; by thy fair Future Hopes, and by this thy Regal State, Which Chance with various Change doth agitate, We pray; afford some small time e'er we go, Upon our dearest Children to bestow Our last, and perhaps dying Kisses. Cre. Time, Only for Fraud thou ask'st. Me. What Fraud or Crime Can in so short a space be fear'd? Cre. âNone can âFor Mischief be too short. Me. Deny'st thou then So small a Moment to a Wretches Tears? Cre. Tho thy Intreaties by our ominous Fears Opposed are, one Day thou shalt obtain. Me. Thy Grant's too great; revoke some part again; And hence we speed. Cre. If 'fore to morrows Sun Advance the chearful Day, thou art not gone, Thou surely dy'st. But us the Time now calls To Pray'rs, and Rites of Hymen's Festivals. [Exeunt. CHORUS. Rash Man was he, with Ships frail Beak Did first the treach'rous Billows break, And his own native Soil declin'd, Durst trust his Life to trustless Wind. The Seas with doubtful Course divide, And in a slender Plank confide, Drawn to too thin Dimensions far, Twixt Life and Death too poor a Bar. Celestial Signs were yet unknown, And of those Lights use there was none Whose Fires bespangle all the Skies. Nor yet were Pilots grown so wise To shun the stormy Hyads Threat, Th'Olenian Goats bright Star, not yet; Nor those which that old lazy Swain Bootes drives, the Northern Wain. Boreas and Zephyre, yet to none By Names distinguished were known. Tiphys did first on Seas display His Sails, and taught the Winds t'obey New Laws: Now 'fore a quartering Gale His Course to run with all his Sail. Now bring the Tack aboard; now fast His lower'd Yards, bind to the Mast, His Canvas then unfurl'd again, Unto the Winds to hoise amain, When the too greedy Mariner Calls for a Gust; and th'red Drabler Unto th'inlarged Sail made fast, Trembles with the impulsive Blast. The Candid Age of Innocence Our Fathers saw; free from all Sense Of Fraud; then in secured Rest Each Man on his own Ground, liv'd blest With Length of Years; with little rich, Nor of more Wealth, than that with which His Native Soil was stor'd, could tell. The Pine of Thessaly, the well- Divided World's Partitions broke, And caus'd Seas feel th'Oars lashing Stroke; And the secluded Ocean made Part of our Fears: yet sadly paid For this so bold a Wickedness; Through tedious Dangers and Distress, Long driv'n: when those Rocks that bound The Entrance to the Pontick Sound, Tilting with impetuous Shocks, Did eccho like loud Thunder Knocks. 'Twixt whom the Sea crusht, mounts, and laves The Stars and Clouds with foaming Waves. Bold Tiphys then grew pale with Fear, His fault'ring Hands forgot to steer; Silent was Orpheus and his Lute; And Argo's self was then struck mute. What? when the Maid whose Waste surrounds A Cincture of fierce rav'ning Hounds, Did all their Jaws at once extend! What Man with Horror did not bend At such a Sight? Who without Fear Could that loud barking Monster hear? What? when with Magick of their strain, Those dire Plagues, charm'd th'Ausonian Main! Till on his Lyre Pierian play'd Orpheus, and ev'n the Syren made (Wont Ships to captive while she sings) Follow the Musick of his Strings. What was the Purchase of so bold A Voyage, but a Fleece of Gold; And greater Mischief than the Sea, Medea: fit the Fraight to be Of the first Ship. The passive Main Now yields, and does all Laws sustain. Nor the fam'd Argo, by the hand Of Pallas built, by Heroes mann'd, Does now alone complain she's forc'd To Sea; each petty Boat's now cours'd About the Deep; no Boundure stands, New Walls by Towns in foreign Lands Are rais'd; the pervious World in'ts old Place, leaves nothing. Indians the cold Araxis drink, Albis, and Rhine The Persians. Th'Age shall come, in fine Of many years, wherein the Main M' unloose the universal Chain; And mighty Tracts of Land be shown, To Search of Elder Days unknown. New Worlds by some new Tiphys found, Nor Thule be Earth's farthest Bound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. Enter Nurse, following Medea running frantick over the Stage. NURSE. Ah! whither rapt with eager speed away Dear Charge? hold, curb thy Rage, thy Fury stay! As when some frantick Fro, whom Bacchus mads, Trots her wild Entheous Dance, and raving gads On Pindus snowy Top, or Nysa's Crown: So here, now there, she hurries up and down, As if with a Lymphatick Rage possest. Her Looks attracting Fervour from her Breast. Cries, O you Gods! then weeps, now smiles again; And all the Symptoms of a troubled Brain Discovers; doubts, threatens, with Anger boils, Laments and sighs; Oh! to what Centre toils This Weight of Cares? these Threats where will she wreak? Or where will this high Sea of Fury break? Which like an Inundation swells: No low Nor vulgar Mischief she intends; t'out-go Her self she seeks: we know full well, her old Distempers Signs; some eminently bold, Horridly impious Act, she plots: 't appears In her fell Looks: The Gods deceive our Fears. Scene II. Enter MEDEA. If, Wretch, a Rule thou wouldst prescribe thy Hates, Thy rash Love imitate; Tamely (ye Fates!) And unreveng'd shall we these Nuptials bear? Shall this Day idly pass? sought with such Care And Toil! with so much Difficulty gain'd! Whilst self-poiz'd Earth in midst of Heav'n's sustain'd, And the bright Orbs their stated Changes run, Whilst Sands no Number know; whilst Day the Sun, And Night the Stars attend; whilst 'bout the Pole The undrench'd Arctos turns, and Rivers roll Into the Main; our deadly vengeful Spite Shall ne'er grow less, but rise t'a greater height. What wild Beasts Salvageness? What chased Waves Ingulf'd in Scylla's and Charybdis Caves? What Ãtna, (under which TyphÃ¦us Iies, Expiring Flames) our Rage shall equalize? Nor rapid Streams, nor Torrents heady course, Nor wrathful Euxine Seas, by Corus Force Vext into Storms, nor Flames blown up by Wind Can stop th'incensed Fury of my Mind. I'll down with all.âCreon his Fears did move (Forsooth) and King Acastus Arms;ââTrue Love âCan never stoop to fear of any?âBut, O'erpower'd he was inforc'd to yield:âCould not He yet to his poor Wife have bid adieu! My Life! stout tho he be, he fear'd this too. Yet sure, being Creon's Son, he might a while Have respited the Time of our Exile. But one short Day, to take my last farewel Of both my Children!âYet, tho short, 'tis well. Much, much shall these few Hours produce; that Fact Which all Days else shall ring of, this shall act. We will invade the Gods, and shake the Frame Of the whole Universe. Nu. Thy Mind reclaim, Thy Heart, with Griefs disturbed, pacify. Me. âNo thought of Rest, till, with our own, we see âA general Ruine; perish if we shall, âPerish all else; We will not singly fall. Nu. See how great Dangers thy Attempts oppose! â'Gainst potent Opposites none safely goes. Scene III. Enter JASON. Still cruel Fates! Fortune severe alike! Equally bad, or if she spare or strike! So often Heav'n, hath for our desp'rate Woes, Found Remedies more desperate than those. Would we the Faith, to our Wife's Merits due, Have kept; We must have dy'd. Death to eschew We must be faithless; not to this inclin'd By abject Fear, but a paternal Mind. For in their Parents Ruine, our poor Race Would be involv'd. O Justice! if a place In Heav'n thou hast, by thy white Throne I swear The Children overcame their Sire. Nor e'er Shall I think other, but that she (tho fierce Of Heart, and beyond all Reclaim perverse,) Her Childrens Lives would 'fore my Bed desire. Wirh Pray'rs we were resolv'd t'accost her Ire, But see! sh' hath spy'd us; ill the Sight she brooks, Disdain and Passion printed in her Looks. Me. We flie! Jason, we flie! for us to change Seats, is not new; the Cause is new and strange. For thee we us'd, but now from thee we flie. Whom thus from your Abodes inforce you hie? To whom dost send us? shall we Phasis Flood, Colchos and our Sire's Realms, or Fields with Blood Of slaughter'd Brother stain'd, go seek? what Lands, What Seas must we find out at thy Commands? The Pontick Straits? through which that Princely Train We safe brought home; when through th'incensed Main And dangerous Symplegades, we fled With thee, now turn'd Adulterer to our Bed? Shall we for small Iolcos make? or steer Unto Thessalian Tempe? what ways e'er To thee we open'd, 'gainst our selves we clos'd. Then whither send y' us? to what Lands expos'd? To Exile, an exiled Wretch is sent And yet no place assign'd for Banishment. Yet go we must, so to command seems fit To Creon's Son-in-law, and we submit. Inflict on us the worst of Cruelties, We have deserv'd. Let Creon exercise The bloodiest Tortures Tyranny e'er bred, To plague a Strumpet to his Daughter's Bed. Load us with Irons; and shut us from all Light In a dark Dungeon of eternal Night: Yet shall we suffer less than we deserve. Ingrateful Wretch! think (if thy Heart will serve To let thee) of the Flame-breath'd Bulls; the Field Which Armies of Arm-bearing Foes did yield. When, at our sole Command, those Earth-born Bands Mutually fell by their self-slaught'ring Hands. To these, add the Phryxean Rams rich Prize, And sleepless Dragon charm'd; whose wakeful Eyes Obey'd Sleep's unknown Pow'r: our Brother slain, Mischief with Mischiefs re inforc'd again. Fraud-blinded Daughters urged to divide Their Parents Limbs, unto new Life deny'd. And our own Kingdoms for a Stranger's Crown Deserted; by what Hopes soe'er you own Of your dear Children; by the Certainty Of thy new-fix'd Abodes; and Victory O'er vanquisht Monsters; by these Hands of ours Ne'er spar'd for thee t'imploy their utmost Pow'rs. By fore-past Fears; Heav'ns, Seas (the Witnesses Of our wrong'd Nuptials) pity our Distress. And in thy happy state, to us that crave Render the Comfort thou would'st wish to have. Of all the Wealth by Scythians rapt away From Sun-scorch'd Dwellers of rich India, Too narrow an Exchequer for whose Store, Our whole Court seems; with whose superfluous Ore W'adorn the Woods and Groves; no part brought we But our slain Brother's Limbs, and those on thee Impended; Country, Father, Brother, Shame. With this Dowre wed; parting, restore the same. Jas. When wrathful Creon sought thy Life to have, Mov'd by our Tears, for Death he Exile gave. Me. We Exile thought a Punishment; but now We find, that, for a Favour you allow. Jas. Whilst yet thou may'st, get thee from hence convey'd; âThe Wrath of Kings is Heavy. Me. You persuade This to endear you in Creusa's Love; You seek a hated Strumpet to remove. Jas. Objects Medea Love? Me. And Treachery, And Murder too. Jas. What Crime is there, 'gainst me Thou can'st object, deserves so foul a Blame? Me. All that we ever did. Jas. Then 'tis your Aim T'involve us in the Guilt of your Misdeeds. Me. Those, those are thine. âHe to whose Gain succeeds âThe Ill, is the Ill's Author. Tho our Fame All should oppose, thou ought'st defend the same, And say we're blameless: âHe should guiltless be âIn thy Repute, is guilty made for thee. Jas. âThat Life's a burthen, which enjoy'd brings Shame. Me. That Life discharge, enjoy'd with Loss of Fame. Jas. Rather appease thy Wrath-incensed Breast, For thy poor Childrens sakes; Me. No, we detest, Abjure the thought; What? shall Creusa live, And Brothers to Medea's Children give? Jas. 'Twill be an Honour when our exil'd Race, A Queen, shall with her kindred Issue grace. Me. Come never so unfortunate a Day To the already wretched, with Allay Of baser Blood, to mix our noble Line. PhÅbus with Sisyphus his Nephews join. Jas. Why seek'st thou Ruine on us both to bring? Let me intreat thee to depart. Me. The King Could yet vouchsafe to hear us speak. Jas. Declare What's in my Pow'r to do for thee. Me. Me! dare Any Mischief. Jas. On either Hand, see here Two potent Kings. Me. Than those a greater fear, Behold Medea! let us exercise Our Pow'rs, and Jason be the Victor's Prize. Jas. Weary'd with Miseries, I yield; forbear; So often try'd, the turn of Fortune fear. Me. Mistress of Fortune we have ever been. Jas. Acastus there; here Creon's nearer Spleen Threatens Destruction. Me. Void thou either's Harms: Not 'gainst thy Father-i'-law to rise in Arms, Of stain with Kindreds Blood thy Innocence, Medea wills. Guiltless with her fly hence. Jas. Who shall oppose, if they their Pow'rs combine, And 'gainst us with united Forces join? Me. Add Colchians too; Ãeta General; Scythians with Grecians join; we'll foil them all. Jas. I potent Sceptres dread. Me. Rather take heed Y'affect them not. Jas. Lest this our Conference breed Suspect, let's here cut short our long Discourse. Me. Now Jove, o'er all the Heav'ns thy Thunder force, Stretch forth thy Hand, thy vengeful Flames prepare, And from crackt Clouds the World with Horror scare. Nor with delib'rate Aim level thy Throw, Take him or me: which of us each the Blow Shall sink, will guilty fall; if at us cast, Thy Thunder cannot miss. Jas. Resume at last More sober Thoughts, Language more mild; if ought In Creon's Court, in Exile may be thought Easeful to thee, ask and the ask'd;d-for have. Me. Thou know'st we can, and use with Scorn to wave The Wealth of Kings; we only wish we might Our Children have Companions in our flight; That in their Bosoms we our Tears may shed. More Sons thou may'st expect from thy new Bed. Jas. I must confess me willing to comply With thy Desires; forbid by Piety. Nor could I suffer this, tho Creon's Pow'r Should force me to't. For this alone implore I Life; of all my Cares the only Ease, Sooner I could want Breath, Limbs, Light, than these. Me. Loves he his Children so! 'tis well, we ha't; Now we know where to wound himâWe hope yet We may our last Words in their mindful Breasts Implant; embrace; seems this a just Request? This too, we with our latest Speech intreat, What our rash Grief hath utter'd, you'd forget, And a more favourable Memory Of us retain; all Passions buried be. Jas. All, all's forgot by us; and here we pray Thou may'st the Fervour of thy Mind allay, And gentle Curb unto thy Passions give. âPatience is Misery's best Lenitive, Exit. Me. Gone! is't e'en so? hast thou forgotten me? And all my Merits, slipt from thy Memory? No; we will ne'er slip thence. Now mind thy Part; Summon together all thy Strength and Art. 'Tis thy best use of Ills to think there's none. Scarce will there Opportunity be shown T'effect our Treachery. Our Plots they fear. Run then a Course from all Suspicion clear. Begin, Medea! for thy Task prepare; And what thou can'st, and what thou canst not, dare. O faithful Nurse! whom Chance with us hath made Partner in Woes; our wretched Counsel aid. A Robe we have, our Kingdom's Ornament; As Pledge of his Etherial Descent, By Sol t'Ãeta giv'n: a Carquanet With Gold enchac'd, and a rich Coronet Set with bright Gems; these to the new-wed Bride My Sons shall bear; first with dire Tinctures dy'd. Invoke we Hecate; our sad Rites frame, The Altars strow; now crack this Roof in flame. Exit. CHORUS. Nor Force of Flames, nor Strength of Wind, Nor Thunder we such Terror find As a divorc'd Wife, set on fire With Hate and Ardor of Desire. Not Cloudy Auster where he pow'rs Forth Deluges of Winter Show'rs, When Ister like a Torrent roul'd, Breaks Bridges down, runs uncontroul'd. Not Rhodanus with rapid Course Where he resisting Seas does force. Nor HÃ¦mus, when the Sun's hot Beams In mid Spring thaw his Snows to Streams. Love spur'd with Passions blind, disdains All Rule, nor brooks imposed Reins. Fearless of Death, covets upon Drawn Swords with obvious Steps to run. Mercy ye Gods! we Pardon sue, Safe may he live, did Seas subdue. Yet the Deep's Monarch storms, his Pow'r, Next Jove's should stoop t'a Conquerour. Bold Phaeton, that durst aspire To rule the Chariot of his Sire, Whilst from prescribed Bounds he stray'd, Felt the mad Flames his Rashness made. None suffer'd in a known way; tread In that safe Path where others lead. Nor violate the sacred Bands Impos'd by Nature's sacred Hands. Whoe'er those noble Planks which made Bold Argo, touch'd; spoil'd of his Shade The sacred Grove which Pelion crown'd; Past floating Rocks in the Profound; Did through so many Perils wade Of the vast Deep; and Anchor weigh'd From off a barb'rous Coast, possest Of forein Gold; for home addrest, With sad event the Breach he ru'd Of the Seas Rites; with Plagues pursu'd And Justice of the angry Main. Tiphys, who first the Ocean Tam'd, to an unskilful Pilot, left His Charge, on forein Shores bereft Of Life, far from his native Land, 'Mongst unknown Ghosts lies tomb'd in Sand. He from the vocal Muse that springs, At Sound of whose Harmonious Strings, The rapid Streams their Motions ceas'd, Their Murmurs the rude Winds suppress'd, While Birds their own Notes left, this Song Fled listning, and Woods danc'd along; His Limbs o'er Thracian Acres spread Dragg'd unto HÃ¦brus streaming Head, To Styx descended, known before; And Tartarus, to return no more. Alcides Boreas Issue slew; He who could various Shapes indue, From Neptune who derives his Breath, From Hercules receiv'd his Death. He too, when Seas and Earth h' had crown'd With Peace, and forc'd the Stygian Sound, Alive on Ãta's Pyre repos'd, His Limbs to Cruel Flames expos'd. While mingled Gore's Infection, sent By's Wife, his Flesh with Tortures rent: A Boar AncÃ¦us Life o'er-threw, His Uncles Meleager slew, And by the vengeful Hand doth fall Of his enraged Mother; All Deserv'd; What Crime, did expiate That tender Lad's untimely Fate? The Boy by Hercules unfound In Waves of secure Waters drown'd. Go now bold Spirits; plow again, When Springs are to be fear'd, the Main.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Enter NURSE sola. Horror my trembling Soul invades, some great Pernicious Mischief present Ill does threat. How vast a Rage her swelling Grief dilates! Its own Incendiary! Integrates Her lapsed Powers! with Fury oft possest I've seen her charge the Gods, attempt to wrest Heav'n with her Charms: some more prodigious Act Than these yet works she; for as hence she packt With frighted Steps, and her dire Conclave enter'd, Forth all her Spells she pours, and what t've ventur'd On, her self long fear'd, there broaches, a whole Hell Of Ills let loose, close kept in that dark Cell. And whilst she with sinister Hand, prepares Th'infaustous Work, sh' invokes with Magick Pray'rs Whatever Poisons Libya's scalding Sands Create; what Taurus (where cold Winter stands Cloath'd with perpetual Snow,) in's frozen Veins Congeals; and every Monster. At whose strains Crawl scaly Multitudes from under-ground, And as officious Agents wait her round. Thither an aged Serpent trails along His o'ergrown Bulk, and darts his forked Tongue; Seeking on whom t'inflict a Death; at sound Of her dire Charms, his pois'nous Length in round And complicated Orbs he folds; she cries Poor are the Ills, and base the Weapons rise From this low Earth; I'll from the Heav'ns fetch down Poisons to serve my turn; this instant crown With Ills worthy thy self; Now, now's the time Something to act above a vulgar Crime. Hither descend the Snake that seems to lie Like a huge Torrent rolling cross the Skie, In whose immense Folds either Bear is ty'd, The great th'Achaians, th'less Sidonians guide. His griping Hands let Ophiuchus loose, And the squeez'd Venom of his Snake infuse. Hither repair, drawn by these Charms of ours, Python that durst assail two Heav'nly Pow'rs. Hydra, with all the Serpents were subdu'd By Hercules, in their own Death renew'd. And thou the Colchians wakeful Spy, whose Eyes In drowzy Sleep our Spells did first surprize. Then (having call'd of Serpents all the kinds,) Sh' in one mass all pernicious Simples binds. Whatever on impervious Eryx grows, What Caucasus, (where sit continual Snows) Stain'd with Promethean Blood, brings forth; whate'er The Warlike Medes in charged Quivers bear. What flying Parthians use; with what the Points Of his keen Shafts the wealthy Arab 'noints. Those Juices which the noble Sweves inclin'd Near the cold North, in Groves Hercynian find. Whate'er the Earth i'th' procreating Spring Begets, or in the Winter forth doth bring, When rigid Cold in Ice hath all things bound, And Forests of their Summer's Pride uncrown'd. Those Herbs that bloom with a pestiferous Flow'r She culls, the Juice indu'd with baneful pow'r From Roots distorted wrings. From Pindus some, Some Drugs from high Ãmonian Athos come. These tender Sprigs as on PangÃ¦us top They grew, did her blood-canker'd Sickle crop. These Tygris nourish'd, whose swift Streams oppress His gulphy Channel; these Danubius; these The sam'd Hydaspes, whose warm Current laves Dry India's Sands with Gem-inriched Waves. And BÃ¦tis, whence its Land a name did get, Whose languid Streams 'gainst Seas Hesperian beat. These felt the Edge of Knife at birth of Day, In dead of drowzy Night; this slender Spray Was from his Stalk cut down. This ripen'd Blade She did with her charm-tainted Nail invade. The deadly Weeds she takes, and forth doth squeeze Her Serpents putrid Venom, and with these She mixes Birds of inauspicious flight, The Heart o'th' solitary Owl; th'hoarse Night- Ravens Entrails whilst alive exsected. These the pernicious Artist, thus selected, In parcels puts; Flames rav'nous Force these hold, Those th'Icy Chilness of benumming Cold. Words to her Poisons adds, of no less dread Than Poisons are. See! she begins to tread Her frantick Dance, her Rites infernal makes; Now charms; the World at her first Accents quakes. Scene II. Enter MEDEA. You silent People of the Shades below! Ye Gods infernal! and dark Chaos; loe! To you we bow; thou gloomy Mansion Where sooty Dis resides! seated upon The lowest Hell, the Den of squallid Death! We you invoke: quit your Abodes beneath, Leave your old Task of tort'ring Souls, and pack To the new Nuptials. From his wheeling Rack Releas'd, a while Rest let Ixion have, And Tantalus sup free the fleeting Wave. Whilst Creon feels more horrid Pains than these, Let Sysiphus his Torments find no Ease. You who in perforated Urns still vain Successless Toil deludes, cease from your Pain, And thither hie; this Day your Hands requires. And thou, the Empress of Nocturnal Fires! To these our Rites invoked, come; put on Thy worst of looks, and with more Fronts than one Menacing, appear! with loose Hairs thus display'd (As thine becomes) we've searcht each secret shade, With naked Feet; call'd from dry Clouds the Rain, And to its Bottom forc'd the suff'ring Main. Whilst old Oceanus affrighted, hides Within his Waves Recess his vanquish'd Tides. Heav'n's Laws inverted, shewn the World the Light Of Sun and Stars at once, the Day and Night. Drench'd both the Bears in the forbidden Deep. And chang'd the Course the constant Seasons keep. Cloath'd Earth in Summer with a Spring new-born, Made Ceres see a Winter Crop of Corn. Swift Phasis turn his Streams back to their Source. And Ister, in seven Mouths divided, force His Waters to a stand, his Spring confin'd. And made Floods roar, Seas swell, without a Wind. An antient Wood, whose Leaves its Covert made, At our commanding Voice hath lost his Shade. PhÅbus his Course, Day left at Noon, forbears; And when we sing the Stars drop from their Spheres. 'Tis time, dread PhÅbe, at these Rites of thine Thou present wert; to thee this Wreath of nine Embraided Serpents, wrought with bloody hand, We offer. Loe! his biform'd Limbs durst band 'Gainst Jove's high Empire, bold TyphÃ¦us! this The pois'nous Blood of treach'rous Nessus is, Giv'n by himself as he did Life expire. These Ashes rak'd we from the Oetean Pyre, Dryp'd with Herculean Foam. See, in this hand The pious Sisters, impious Mothers Brand, Vengeful AlthÃ¦a! these Plumes found we cast By rapeful Harpies, as by Zetes chas'd. These are the Wings the wounded Stymphal'de bore Slain by the Shafts dipt in LernÃ¦an Gore. The Altars sound! and our own Tripods, mov'd B'our fav'ring Goddess, shew these Rites approv'd. See Trivia's whirling Carr! not as when bright, With a full Orb illuminating Night, She drives; but such, when with a lured Face, Vext with Thessalian Charms, a nearer Race, To Earth she runs: so shine thy tristful Light With pallid Ray, and with strange Horror fright The World: whilst thy Extreams to ease, O Great Dictynna! rich Corinthian Brass is beat. Upon this blood-stain'd Turf our Sacrifice To thee we make, this Funeral Torch supplies Nocturnal Fires, snatch'd from the flaming Pile. To thee our Head we toss, with Neck bow'd, while Our Charms we utter; our Hairs loosely spread A Fillet binds, as when we mourn the Dead. To thee this wither'd Bough thus wave we round, Brought from the dark Shades near the Stygian Sound. To thee with bared Breast true MÃ¦nad like, This rusty Knife thus in our Arms we strike. Our streaming Blood down to the Altar flows; Inure your selves, my Hands, such Wounds t'impose, And learn the dearest Blood of thine to shed. The hallowed Flood our pierced Veins have bled. If thou complain'st thou art too often prest B'our Orisons, pardon a forc'd Request. That thus, O Persis! we thy Pow'rs implore, The Cause is still the same as heretofore, Still Jason: now infect the Bride's Attire, That when put on, the close Serpentine Fire, Her inmost Marrow may consume, within The yellow Gold, couch'd lies the Flame unseen. Which he who rues his heav'nly Theft, with still Renewed Liver, gave; and taught the Skill How to conceal its Force; Mulciber did Give us these Fires, in subtle Sulphur hid. This living flash of fatal Lightning, we From Phaeton our Cousin took; here be The Gifts the triple-shap'd ChimÃ¦ra gave. The Flames breath'd from the Bulls scorch'd Throats we have, Which mixed with Medusa's Gall do serve, So charg'd, the secret Mischief to conserve. With Pow'r these Poisons, Hecate, inspire, And guard the hidden Seeds of the close Fire Lurks in these Gifts, let them deceive the Test Of Sight and Touch; whilst in her Veins and Breast The subtle Fervour spreads, and doth calcine Her melting Limbs; in Smoak let her Bones pine, And her inflamed Tresses, beam-like blaze, And dim the Light her Nuptial Tapers raise. âOur Pray'rs are heard; thrice Hecat' bark'd aloud, Thrice with sad Flames her sacred Fires she show'd. All's finish'd. Nurse, my Children call, that they Unto Creusa may these Gifts convey. Go Children; Issue of a hapless Mother; Go, by your Pray'rs and Presents seek another, Less kind t'appease. Back hither quickly hie, That we your last Embraces may enjoy. CHORUS. Whither runs bloody MÃ¦nas, drove By the fierce Fury of her Love? What Mischief with wild Rage intends! In Frowns her wrinkled Forehead bends. Shaking her Head, she proudly jets, And menaces the King with Threats. Who her an Exile would suppose? The flushing Red in her Cheeks glows. Now Paleness thence the Red does chace, No Colour long her changing Face Retains; now here she runs, now there, Distracted as her Passions bear. As Tygress of her young bereft, With wild Speed prosecutes the Theft Through Ganges Forest; so, nor Rage Medea knows, nor Love t'asswage, Now Wrath and Love their Pow'rs conjoin; What will she do? to which incline? When from Pelasgian Lands away Will she her cursed self convey? And by her wished Absence clear The Kings and Kingdom of their Fear? Now, PhÅbus, drive with winged pace, No curbing Reins retard thy Race. In her dark shades let friendly Night, Now hide the Lustre of the Light And Hesperus, Night's Usher, steep The fear'd Day in the Western Deep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Enter NUNCIUS and CHORUS. NUNCIUS. All's lost! our Kingdom's Glory sunk in Fire; The Princely Daughter and her Royal Sire In blended Ashes lie. Cho. Say how betray'd? Nun. Ev'n by those usual Trains for Kings are laid. By Gifts. Cho. In those what Treachery could be? Nun. Nay, that's my wonder: Nor, tho th'Fact I see, Can my Belief receive't for possible. Cho. The manner of so strange a Ruine tell. Nun. As 'twas commanded, the devouring Flame Assaults each part o'th' Palace: the whole Frame In pieces falls; and now we fear the Town. Cho. The raging Flames with thrown-on Water drown. Nu. Ev'n that Astonishment and Wonder breeds In this Disaster, Fire on Water feeds; The more supprest, the more it burns; and grows By that which to extinguish we impose. Scene II. Enter MEDEA, and her NURSE. NURSE. Fly! fly, Medea! quickly hence be gone, And seek with speed some other Region. Me. How should we fly!âNo; were we fled, to see This Day, we would return again; to be Spectatress of these Gallant Nuptials.âHeart! Dost stop? pursue thy happy Rage; this part Of thy enjoy'd Revenge, what is't?âDistraught! Dost thou yet love? is widowed Jason thought Sufficient? work, Medea, work! invent Some strange unusual kind of Punishment. Hence with all Right, expulsed Shame be gone. âThat's poor Revenge, which Hands yet pure have done. Be all intent on Wrath; bravely excite Thy drooping Thoughts, and with more eager Might Rouze up th'old sparks of Rage hid in thy Breast. What we have done already, to the rest W'intend, may be call'd Piety: now ply't; Let the World know how vulgar and how slight Our former Ills were, but as Preludes to Ensuing Rage. What could such rude Hands do, Might be term'd great? or by a Girl be shown? We're now Medea; our Invention grown, As our Ills multiply'd. Now, now we're joy'd, We lopt our Brother's Head, and did divide His bleeding Limbs; that we our Father spoil'd Of his Crowns sacred Treasure; and beguil'd Daughters to take up parricidal Arms. Seek matter for thy Fury, for all Harms That brings a Hand prepar'd.âWrath whither, oh! Transported art thou? 'Gainst what treach'rous Foe Intend'st these Weapons?âSomething my fierce Mind, But what I know not, hath within design'd, Nor dares t'her self disclos'tâFool, I have been Too fondly rash. Oh that I could have seen Some Children of the Strumpet got!âWhat's thine By Jason think Creusa bore. This kind Of Vengeance likes; and likes deservedly. The height of Ills, with a Resolve as high Attempt: You, we did once our Children call, For your Sire's Crimes a Satisfaction fall, âHorror invades my Heart; an icy Cold Stiffens my Limbs; my Breast pants; Wrath his hold Hath left, and there (a Wive's stern Passions quit) A Mother's soft restor'd Affections sit. We in our Childrens Blood our hands imbrue? Ah! better Thoughts distracted Griefs pursue! Far be it from Medea yet, to act So foul a Sin, or so abhor'd a Fact. What Crime, poor Wretches! shall they suffer for? âTheir Father's Crime enough, and greater far Their Mother. Let 'em die, they're none of mine. Hold! they're thine own: then perish because thine. Alas! they're innocent: without a touch Of Guilt: 'tis true; my Brother too was such. Why stagger'st thou my Soul? or why do Tears Water my Cheeks? whilst Passion this way bears My wav'ring Mind, now that way Love divides; Toss'd in an Eddy of uncertain Tides. As when the Winds wage war, the passive Waves Are counter-rockt, the Sea a Neuter raves. So floats my wreckt Heart; now Wrath wins the Field, Now Piety; to Piety Wrath yield. Oh! you, the only Joy and Comfort left Of our sad State! now of all else bereft; Come hither, my dear Children! and with mine Your little Arms in close Embraces join. May in your Lives your Father yet delight, Whilst I your Mother mayâExile and Flight Inforce me on: strait from my Arms with Cries Will they be torn; then perish from all Joys Of Father as of Mother. Grief again Renews; my Hate boils high, my heated Brain Its old Rage fires, and stirs m'abhorred Hand Up to new Mischief. On then, thy Command We follow. Would an Issue from my Womb As numerous as Niobe's had come. And twice seven Children had from us deriv'd Their Births: our Barrenness hath ev'n depriv'd Our Vengeance; yet w'have two: enough t'expire As Victims to our Brother and our Sire. âWhither does this dire Troop of Furies bend? Whom seek they? where their fiery Strokes intend? 'Gainst whom shake they their bloody Brands, Snakes wound In lashing Whips with horrid Hisses sound. Whom does MegÃ¦ra with infestive post Pursue? what yet unknown dismember'd Ghost, Is this appears? 'tis my Brother's, come to crave Vengeance of us; and Vengeance shalt thou have. But first, fix all these Fire-brands in my Eyes; Tear, burn; my Breast to Furies open lies. Hence these dread Ministers of Vengeance send, And bid these Spirits satisfi'd descend. Leave me to my self, Brother; to imploy This Arm in thy revenge, that did destroy Thy Life; thus with this Victim we appease Thy injur'd Ghost.âWhat suddain Sounds are these? What means this Noise?âArms 'gainst my Life are bent. Up to the Houses top force thy Ascent: Finish thy Murder there. Come you with me My small Companion: whilst this Body we Convey along. Now, Soul, thy task intend, Nor thy brave Mischief unregarded end In secret; shew't the People, let them stand, Th'amaz'd Spectators of thy Tragick hand. Scene III. Enter JASON, cum Armatis. JASON. You whom the Murder of your Prince doth move With sad Resentments of a loyal Love, The Author of that execrable Deed Help to surprize; hither with Weapons speed You armed Cohorts, here this House surround, And lay the Fabrick level with the Ground. Me. Ay, now our Sceptre, Brother, Sire, again W'enjoy, and Colchans their rich Spoil retain. Our Kingdom and our lost Virginity Are now restor'd: O long cross Destiny At length grown kind! O festive Nuptials! On, Give thy Revenge, as Crime, Perfection. Dispatch while thy hand's in.âWhy thus delays My Soul? what Doubts?âOur potent Wrath decays; Now of the Fact a shameful Penitent. What have I done? Wretch! such tho I repent, I've don't; an ample Joy m'unwilling Heart Seizes: it grows upon me. Yet this part Of Vengeance wanted, he not being here, Nor a Spectator; without whom whate'er W've done, is lost. Jas. See where she sits, upon Yon Houses shelving top! hither some one Bring burning Brands, and Fire impose on Fire; That scorch'd in her own Flames she may expire. Me. Do, raise your Sons a Fun'ral Pile; your Bride And Father-in-law, our Kindness did provide With Rites of Sepulture. His Doom this Son Hath felt; the like shall this, whilst thou look'st on. Jas. By all the Gods! by our Community Of Flight and Bed, which uninforced I Ne'er violated: spare this Child; O spare Me this: the Crime is mine, then let me share The Punishment; and let deserved Death, Seize on my guilty Head, and loathed Breath. Me. No; where thou would'st not ha't, where thou dost feel Most Sense of Sorrow, will we force our Steel. Go now, thou proud Insulter, go and wed Young Virgins now, and leave a Mother's Bed. Jas. Let one suffice t'have suffer'd. Me. If our Rage One Death, or single Slaughter could asswage We none had sought; and tho both die, yet that T'our Wrongs is not Revenge commensurate; If in our Womb a Pledge there be, ev'n there This Steel shall search't, and thence the Embrion tear. Fa. Dispatch thy Villany; no more we crave: An End at least now let our Suff'rings have. Me. Haste not my Grief; but leisurely imploy Thy slow Revenge. This Day's our own; w'enjoy Th'accepted time. Jas. Death, cruel! we implore, Kill me. Me. Thou Pity crav'st. All's done; nor more Had we (O Sorrow!) as a Sacrifice To offer thee. Erect thy humid Eyes, Ingrateful Jason, here look up; dost know Thy Wife? thus use we to escape: Heav'ns show Our slight clear way; see both our Dragons here, Who freely stoop their scaly Necks to bear Their willing Yoke. Now take your Sons, whilst I On winged Wheels through Airy Regions fly. Jas. Go, thro' the high Ãtherial Stages post, And shew there are no Gods where'er thou go'st. FINIS.</field>
