      <field name="fulltext">LOVE'S SACRIFICE; OR, THE RIVAL MERCHANTS. A Play, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO JOHN VANDENHOFF, ESQ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS Love's Sacrifice; or, the Rival Merchants. The plot of this play is simple, well-conducted, and affecting; the characters are drawn with truth and spirit, and the language is appropriate, impassioned, and eloquent. There is a pleasant admixture of sparkling comedy; and in Jean Rusé, the merchant's clerk, we have that rare merit—originality. Poetical justice is duly awarded. The repentant and sorrowful man is released from his thraldom, and comforted; true love finds a fond return; and the cunning, heartless knave is stripped of his ill-gotten possessions, and dismissed with contempt. Would that in this working-day world rewards and punishments were as righteously distributed! Two merchants, Matthew Elmore and Paul Lafont, are rivals in the way of trade. Elmore, just, generous, and humane, has acquired his riches by industry and fair dealing; Lafont, rapacious, unfeeling, and hypocritical, has left no crooked path untrod, no base deed undone, to obtain his treasure. Both would stand well with the world. The acts of Elmore speak for themselves—his uprightness and munificence have won the good opinion of all men; and in his domestic circle he is beloved with enthusiasm. But the curses of his improvident dupes ring in the ears of Lafont; at every turn he encounters the scowling face of some spendthrift whom he has ruined; he has no peaceful home to fly to—no friend in whose bosom he can repose his discontents —the commercial success and unblemished reputation of Elmore are his tormentors day and night—and not the least of his annoyances are the continued mask he is obliged to wear; the ghastly smiles he is compelled to assume in the height of his mental agony; and the thousand artifices that he plays off to maintain his false station in society; and, as he vainly hopes! to deceive mankind. He has the effrontery to aspire to the daughter of his rival! The beauty of Margaret Elmore fires his plebeian blood; but her gold is the omnipotent charm. Then what advantages will this alliance bring! What snug monopolies! No longer opposed to each other, but acting in friendly concert, the commercial world will be at the command of these two merchant kings! But by hard and dishonest dealings in trade Lafont had not been wholly enriched. The orphan's portion had swelled his hoard, and he is strongly suspected of having applied to his own use the property of Eugene de Lorme, and his sister Herminie de Vermont, to whom he had been left guardian. How admirably the wise father reasons on the importance of letting his daughter have some voice in the selection of a husband. “If I would buy my child a house, a horse, A trinket, bauble—should I not consult Her taste on what would please her? Or if I would bring home some youthful friend, As her companion for a vacant hour. Should she not have a voice in what should be The character of that selected friend? Then, when the question is of one to be The partner of her life to its last breath, The sharer of her heart's most sacred thoughts, The altar of her home—her other self— ? in such a gift as this, Shall my girl have no voice?” True to his professions, when he sees her choice has fallen on his poor dependant Eugene, he cordially approves it; and the union of the lovers seems not far distant. Yet in the prospect of this approaching happiness the heart of Elmore is sad. A mysterious melancholy weighs him down; and, but for his many virtues, we might ask could he give so startling a description of hidden guilt if he had not felt it tearing his own bosom? “Dost know—canst dream what 'tis to take a life? To meet the blood-glazed eye in every object— To hear the dying groan in every sound? For years—years—years— Go where thou wilt, to bear about with thee A hidden wolf gnawing thy shrinking entralls. Eugene and his sister had been made orphans by the Count du Barré, who, though a large reward was offered for his apprehension, had hitherto eluded the keen eye of justice. It was bruited abroad that he was dead—but one Friar Dominic having gained access to Eugene, informs him that the assassin lives, and appealing to his manhood and filial piety, spurs him on to revenge. Lafont, stung to the quick by his contemptuous dismissal, is tortured by the triumphant raillery of his ward Herminie, and the dry humor of his facetious dupe St. Lo, who, in order to comply with the whim of that beautiful young widow in whose bright eyes he would willingly find favour, actually becomes clerk to the harpy that had ruined him! and, to please her extravagant fancy, undertakes to study “Tallow, stock-fish, blubber, salt, train oil, And all your filthy messes.” This scene is constructed with considerable dramatic art, and is exceedingly spirited and entertaining. Equally so is that which immediately follows, where Jean Rusê, a weary official, nailed to his everlasting desk, pale, painstaking, pensive—his back bent, and his nose and chin pointed like his pen—moralizes on the wickedness of the world—adds up, multiplies, subtracts—turns the threes into fives, and the sixes into nines—puts a one before the naughts, or attaches to them a tail; and emulating his worthy master in a small way, plays all sorts of minor rogueries, and robs by retail! The mad-cap Herminie despatches Manou, the pretty housekeeper of Lafont, to try her blandishments upon this automaton quill-driver; to fire his cold blood with sparkling nectar; so, that when thrown off his guard, he may (in vino veritas!) blab out some villainous secret by which the wronged might be righted. The plot succeeds admirably. The adust Jean Rusê, unused to be caressed by a winning young damsel, unbends by degrees; another glass—another—and another—animate this professional Skewer into life and motion; till waxing unwontedly amorous, he seizes the pretty, soft hand of Manou, points to the private closet of Lafont, (to which he had prudently provided a second key!) and broadly hints that there are deposited secrets worth knowing. At this moment St. Lo, who, much to his amusement, has been listening, breaks in upon their tête-a-tête; and whispers the Abigail, to obtain that same key. He slaps Jean Rusé familiarly on the shoulder; reminds him that they are fellow-clerks, and must be brothers; proposes a jollification; (Jean never was joll!) a rouse in the cellar of the penurious Paul. “What will master say?” hiccups the astonished clerk. “Hang master!” responds the merry Manou. “Draw him!” ejaculates the loud-laughing St. Lo. “Quarter him!” chuckles the non se ipse quill-driver. But the ruling passion coming over him, he relapses into moralising, with something, however, like a new reading— “It's very shocking, drinking master's wine, though! It's a sad—no! no!—it's a funny world!” The mysterious Friar quitted not the presence of Eugene unobserved by Elmore, who, with that quick instinct “Which wakes antipathies within our blood,” felt “he was a man to shun.” He had since traced him to the house of Lafont, and while speculating upon what could be his business there, Lafont himself is announced! “Lafont!—Did I not say so! I'll not see him— I say I will not have my privacy Intruded on”— But Lafont is grown bold. He enters unceremoniously—and little heeding the indignant remonstrances of Margaret and Eugene, demands and obtains a private interview. With refined cruelty—pausing at every step as he proceeds with his narrative, to mark its effect upon his agonised victim, Lafont details with torturing minuteness every particular of the murder of the Count de Lorme. And, that the trying scene may have an appropriate close, he proclaims that “This outlaw, with a price set on his head— This Count du Barré—is called—Matthew Elmore!” The miserable man utters a loud shriek, and falls senseless to the ground. Reason returns, and the daughter hears from the trembling lips of her father the true story. De Lorme and Du Barré wooed a fair lady—De Lorme won her. Instigated by causeless jealousy, the mistaken husband treated with harshness his innocent bride, who, pining with mental anguish, drooped—and, in giving birth to the infant Eugene, died. On the evening of her burial, when the deep toll of the funeral bell rang in his ear, and the heavy tread of the corpse-bearers startled night's stillness—Du Barré, scarcely knowing whither he wandered, halted at the river's bank. Encountering his rival, fierce words ensued—De Lorme drew his sword—was disarmed, and felled to the ground. He pursued his antagonist, and in the deadly struggle, received the weapon (again wrenched from his firm grasp) in his bosom. Du Barré fled; and in after years wedded a gentle being. But the curse of Cain hung over him, and she died. Strong affection for those whose only parent he had slain; and still stronger compunction for his crime, impelled him to rescue the helpless orphans from the oppression of Lafont. He assumed the name of Elmore; became a thriving merchant, and one of the most respected and beloved among men. Who now shall restore him to his high estate? Who, in his desolation, shall protect and comfort him? His devoted daughter! She will forego the fondest wish of her heart, and make Love's Sacrifice. Already her hand is stretched forth to sign the marriage contract that gives her to Lafont, when Elmore forbids the unholy deed, and hurls proud defiance at his crafty accuser. Frantic with rage, the disappointed villain orders the door to be guarded, and calls in the exempts to secure their prisoner. By a pleasant stratagem of Manou and St. Lo, Morluc and Du Viray, two masquerading companions of the latter, are transmogrified into whiskered officials; and truly the scapegraces make a pair of very redoubtable ruffians; their fierce looks bespeak racks and halters! They try their “'prentice hand” upon Jean Rusé; secure his skeleton key; open the private closet; carry off such papers as are likely to serve their purpose, and scatter the remainder upon the ground! Resolved upon the sacrifice, Margaret, in a strain of great pathos and power, bids an eternal farewell to Eugene; who, bewildered, and unable to solve the mystery, determines that he who first “Encouraged his young love to soar, shall be His counsel now in his despair.” But a few words of passionate remonstrance change his purpose; and Margaret, pressing his hand to her lips, hurries from the distracting ordeal to the presence of the Friar. Her character now rises to a solemnity that inspires with deep awe. With the self-abandonment of a broken heart, with the terrible calmness of despair, she comes to make Love's Sacrifice. “Have you no kin?—no brother?—father?” demands the monk. This touches a tender chord— “To you I owe this lonely desolation. 'Twas you who raised the storm where we are wrecked,” she replies. And when the Friar speaks of her “Father's guilt,” she bursts into an agony of fearful denunciation that makes the stoutest heart tremble. But the dreadful secret—That must be kept inviolate—She snatches a pen—'Tis done! Frenzied, and past all hope—Elmore himself proclaims his own delinquency to the wondering hearers that surround him. Eugene and Herminie start with incredulity; and Lafont, caught in his own snare, consigns the culprit to the sham officials, Morluc and Du Viray. What now says the meddling Friar? Addressing Lafont, he hints that some proof is yet wanting of the death of the Count de Lorme, and proceeds to narrate, how “Upon the night when it was thought he died, Two monks of a small solitary convent That stood upon the river's farther bank, Hearing a cry, ferried across the stream, And found a bleeding man.” They staunched his wound—he recovered—joined the holy brotherhood —and, “unloving and unloved,” lingered on, a miserable man. His penitence, and the freshening dews that heaven, in after years, shed upon his broken spirit, are thus beautifully described— —“First he wept For that pure angel he had wrong'd so foully; And then his children's images rose up Like a soft dream;—and still the longing grew, Until he pin'd to see them.” Returning affection brought him to Paris. He found his ancient foe the protector of his orphans. The rest is soon told—'Tis De Lorme himself that speaks! As an appropriate conclusion to our quotations from this fine play, we subjoin the reply of Margaret to the Friar's question (“Maiden, thou lovest this boy?”) ere he places her hand in that of Eugene. “When first he asked me—when my sunny heart Had never known a cloud—I told him so; And when that trial came, which seem'd to part us, Oh, then I felt how truly I had spoken! I may not, now our sky is bright again, Deny what storm and sunshine both have vouched!” Who shall say that Genius—aye, and of a high order!—is not abroad? Depraved must be the taste, and cold the heart, that can contemplate these stirring scenes without emotion. Their author has drank deep at the ancient fountains of inspiration; and this masterly effort walks him over the heads of every living dramatist—Miss Mitford (perhaps) excepted—and Sheridan Knowles—by whose side he is worthy to stand in meet companionship. Despising the meritricious glare of false sentiment—the high-sounding words and timorous meanings—the wire-drawn, impossible plots—the vapid bluster of thundering, blundering Heroes—the lackadaisical loose twaddle of love-sick, lady-like non-entities, all grimacierie and gimp, Cranbourn-alley white muslin and myrtle, by which certain vain pretenders to the dramatic art have risen to notoriety —the author of Love's Sacrifice has taken the right course; achieved his triumph by legitimate means, and done honour to the literature of his country. Love's Sacrifice was performed for the first time at Covent Garden, Sept. 12, 1842. It met with brilliant success. For many years the stage has not produced so perfect a representation as the Matthew Elmore of Mr. Vandenhoff. The terror of his looks; the agitation of his frame; his broken voice, and choked utterance when his long-hidden guilt is revealed, and its fearful consequences start to his view, exhibited a thrilling picture of anguish, remorse, and despair. The character was finely conceived and nobly sustained; and the audience felt so, by their breathless attention, their emotions and their tears. Since the days of O'Neil, we have witnessed nothing so beautifully chaste; so exquisitely pathetic; and, when occasion required, of such high power, as the acting of Miss Vandenhoff in Margaret. It was feminine gentleness wrought upon by stern necessity, and sublimed by duty and affection. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Lacy (the gallant St. Lo and the wild young widow Herminie) were every way excellent; and Mrs. Orger and Mrs. Humby, (Manou and Jenny), as usual, were picquant and entertaining. Meadows was the incarnation of a withered rascally old clerk, ever robbing and railing; muddling and moralising.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —The Palais Royal. Enter St. Lo, Morluc, and Du Viray, from a gaming house, C. Saint Lo. Pest on the cards, the dice, the hour, the place, Fortune, misfortune, luck, myself, the world, And every man in it! Du V. Have you lost all? St. Lo. Drained to the bottom, and my pocket made What prudent nature loathes—a vacuum! I am an empty bag—a drawn-off butt; Shake me—you will not find a jingle in me; Tap me—I'm hollow—nothing left but noise. Mor. Go to Lafont, and get you filled again. St. Lo. Go to a usurer without a pledge! Go to a well without a pitcher first, And ask the water to flow up to you. I've nothing left to draw with.—One by one, Lafont has had my lands, my houses, horses, My furniture, my very pots and pans! I've not a fraction's fag end left of all My patrimony— Du V. Then, before the last Resource of want—the Morgue—try matrimony. St. Lo. I can't! I am in love! Mor. In love! ha, ha! Du V. Psha! With the widow Herminie de Vermont. Mor. A ward of Paul Lafont! Du V. Who, though his eyes Are moderately sharp on most occasions, Swears they could never see the fortune she Declares her father left. Mor. Try Margaret Elmore, The English merchant's daughter, and sole heir. There is a bait, now, even old Lafont Licks his dry lips at. St. Lo. Margaret and Lafont! What profanation! Mor. Why? Lafont and Elmore Are the two richest merchants in our city, And what more fit than to unite them thus? St. Lo. And think you Elmore would consent to it? Elmore—a man who rates a reputation Above a life; whose own unspotted virtue Brooks not the lightest shadow of a stain; Whose proud, tenacious honour, holds itself At guard against the world. He sell his child For gold—and to a bidder like Lafont! Mor. 'Twere hard to say: Elmore is a strange man. When he first settled here, some three years back, How eagerly he sought the young De Lormes, Herminie and her brother, for no cause But being orphans, with a knavish guardian. Du V. And when he found that Herminie was married, He took Eugene, the other, to his house, Adopted him, treated him like a son, And till this daughter, Margaret, appeared, All thought intended him his heir. St. Lo. And so He may be yet; for Eugene loves her. Mor. Loves her! You shall outbid him then—you shall adore her! St. Lo. Psha! What can Margaret ever be to me? I grant her young—I grant her passing fair— Her voice a music and her smile a spell; Rich in attractions, talents, virtues, graces, In all that makes her sex a glittering wonder. I grant, had Herminie been never born, Margaret had shone a very gem of women; Yet she is but a woman: Herminie, The saucy, wild, provoking Herminie, Is—is— Mor. An angel—Out with it! St. Lo. She is— As surely as Lafont is— Du V. What? St. Lo. A devil— Which I'll be sworn to! Nothing merely mortal Could have cajoled a man as he has me. His silky smoothness is not of this world; His sugared smile has nothing earthly in it— None of the spice and pepper of a man! He's never in a passion—that's not human. Morluc—Du Viray—do now, if you love me, Find out for me what tailor makes his clothes; If they are fashioned like another man's— If there is no provision for a tail? Enter Paul Lafont and Jean Ruse, behind, R. &amp; R. Mor. Lafont's a man of high repute. St. Lo. A devil! Du V. Of wealth unquestioned. St. Lo. Sir, I say, a devil! I'll have him nothing less. Own him a devil, Or we are enemies. Mor. Oh, if you wish it, Lafont's a devil, then! Du V. So let it be, With all my heart. Laf. [Advancing.] Ha, ha! ha, ha! How do? [They look embarrassed. You think I heard you. Well, what if I did? Don't look distressed. It grieves me!—You are well? That's right—that's right. [Embracing them.] A little ebullition Of youthful mirth. I'm very fond of youth— I am, indeed—so open, so ingenuous! Your hands again—Ha, ha! That's very good. You've had a merry night?—Sad rogues, wild rogues! How went the cards, St. Lo? St. Lo. As though you had made them— Fleeced me of every sou! Laf. Dear—that's a pity! What will you do? St. Lo. Starve, I suppose, or hang— Blow out my brains—or jump into the Seine— Or make some such short, gentlemanly ending. Laf. How very shocking! It distresses me— It does indeed! St. Lo. Well—will you help me live, then? Laf. Without security? Ha! that's irregular— Unbusiness-like—it is indeed, St. Lo— You must not ask me—think of the example! Mor. Come, Lafont; you must do something for him. The highwayman that takes the traveller's purse Will scarcely grudge restoring a few coins To help him on the road.—You can't do less. Du V. He is our friend—and if you deal too hardly, You'll drive us to withdraw our custom. Laf. [Aside.] Hm! Well, I suppose then I must offer something— And he's so pleasant!—“Paul Lafont's a devil!”— “Do they make no provision for a tail?”— I must do something for this dear St. Lo! St. Lo. Well—what's your answer?—Will you help me, gratis? Laf. Hm!—I am so soft-hearted—and I love you So very much, St. Lo—I do indeed— I think I must—to an old friend like you— It's very foolish—but that's just my way!— I had a clerk—poor fellow!—died last week— His stool is not yet filled—and—you shall have it. St. Lo. Have your clerk's stool! Laf. His place, St. Lo. St. Lo. A clerk! Your clerk! Laf. We give no salary the first five years, Because of the advantages; but then You'll learn the business—be lodged and fed— Live all in-doors—the changes of the seasons Will never reach you:—in your small snug office, From dawn to midnight, let the tempest pour Or the sun broil without, you will be safe. [Aside.] If he accepts this he's far gone indeed! Mor. [To Jean.] But if he marries? Jean. Clerks must never marry. St. Lo. [Gasping.] Your clerk! Laf. Here, Jean Rusé!—Tell dear St. Lo The luxuries a clerk enjoys. Jean. I can't! Laf. Jean, you are jealous!—That's a wicked feeling! Never be envious of another's good! St. Lo. [Dragging Jean forward.] Come here, you dried up skin of withered parchment! Do I look like a clerk? Jean. Perhaps not yet— But after serving five-and-thirty years You'll be much altered. St. Lo. Five-and-thirty years! Go—go—poor wretch! Laf. Now, pray my dear St. Lo Don't be precipitate—consider of it! Jean. Oh, what a wicked world!—Reject a clerkship!— What black ingratitude! Laf. He'll think upon it. He'll think upon it, Jean! Sweet gentlemen, You'll talk to him. I cannot stay myself. I am upon my way to our dear Elmore, And his sweet daughter.—Ah, Sirs! There's a man! Such wealth—such virtue!—How he makes us love him. St. Lo, perhaps, will one day be an Elmore— It's only to begin.—Good bye, St. Lo— I love you very much—I do indeed! You'll think upon my offer.—Dear Du Viray— My very dear Morluc—I kiss your hands! [Exit, L. Jean. [To St. Lo.] Oh, most unhappy youth!—Reject a clerkship! [Exit, L. [Morluc and Du Viray burst into shouts of laughter St. Lo. Don't laugh!—I'll not endure it!—Were he not Herminie's guardian, I'd not leave a bone Whole in his body!—Don't stand laughing there, But help me to abuse him!—May all plagues Of ruined spendthrifts cling like plasters to him! Unmanageable duns, with bills unpaid, Growing with mushroom speed, a crop a night, Hang on his steps!—May he for ever hold Cards from which all the trumps have been forgot, And dice that will throw nothing but deuce-ace! May he—come, help me—help me! Mor. Be in love! St. Lo. And let it be despairingly! Du V. With one Whose fortune, added to his own, will not Make up the purchase of their wedding-ring! St. Lo. That's growing personal—But yet go on!— Mor. And may his mistress have a guardian, too,— A guardian like Lafont! St. Lo. Go on—go on! That was a clincher!—Help me to some more— I have not half done yet. Enter Eugene de Lorme, R. Du V. Eugene! Eug. How now? What is the mood to-day? St. Lo. Moral and savage! There—hold your tongue—I'm cursing— Eug. Cursing!—Whom? St. Lo. Your and your sister's guardian, Paul Lafont. Don't put me out—you'll lose the benefit! Mor. He has just had a dose of good advice, And it is pinching him.—He's desperate! Du V. I think he'll turn a hermit. Mor. Ay—and grow Extremely saintly—and extremely thin! Du V. De Lorme, I give you joy of your companion. Farewell!—We've business. He is in good hands, And we shall hear of him. [Exeunt Morluc and Du Viray, R. Eug. What is the matter? St. Lo. Nothing worth mentioning. My wheels want greasing, And so they shriek a little—that is all. Eug. Dear, dear St. Lo, when will you cast aside These idle follies? St. Lo. Now, boy—now—to-day!— From this hour forth I'll be another man. I will not run in debt—for I've no credit— Nor borrow—for I've no security. Nor gamble—for I've nothing left to stake. Nor—hear your sermons—for I have no patience! Eug. Why force me then to preach? Oh, well you know I burn to call you brother—but my sister Has always the same answer;—your wild courses, Your thoughtless waste, your dissolute companions!— And what can I reply? St. Lo. That she's an angel; And you a lucky, calm, cold-blooded dog, Whose virtue costs him nothing!—It's all luck— Nothing but luck, I tell you. Here am I, Who owned a fortune not a twelvemonth back, What am I now? Cleaned out—drained dry—a beggar— While you, who seemed the butt of all mischances. Motherless from your birth—in infancy Orphaned by violence—your father murdered— His steward left your guardian and his heir. For all your father's lands proved mortgaged to him— What does it matter?—Nothing!—There's your luck— For you up starts a stranger—Matthew Elmore— This English merchant—takes you to his house— Brings home a pretty daughter—gives you means To ruffle with the bravest of her suitors— Makes you—Psha!—Talking of it angers me! Fortune's a jade—the world all goes by luck— Nothing but luck! Eug. All this, and more than this, Has Elmore done for me; more than my tongue Or grateful heart can utter; and I love him As I have dreamed a son should love his father. Oft has my fancy called again to earth My own lost father's unentombed remains From the deep waters where they lie engulphed, And animating them with Elmore's soul, I've asked myself if I could love that father More dearly then than I do Elmore now. St. Lo. And how replied your fancy? Eug. With a sigh! A father!—Oh there is a magic charm In the mere name of kindred, other words Cannot supply!—How I have stood and watched When Elmore gazed upon his daughter's face, While their souls seemed to cling about each other, And from their eyes, like two opposing mirrors, The images received were given back, Again to be returned, again reflected, In endless interchange:—but upon me His calm and chastened smile, though ever kind, Is cold and saddened, too. Yet both are love— That—the proud father's fondness for his child This—the good man's compassion for the orphan. St. Lo. Oh that some good man, with the like good means Would take a like compassion upon me! I would not quarrel with his looks. Inquire If Elmore wants another protégé! I'm disengaged, and wholly at his service; An orphan, too—the very thing to suit him! I'm to be let.—I shall take little room— My baggage will all lie in an arm-chair; My purse pack up within a nurse-maid's thimble. Eug. Nay, not while mine is full. St. Lo. You're a kind fellow— Perhaps I'll take you at your word, and use you; If not, I shall not thank you aught the less: And let your Margaret be but of my mind, You'll win her from them all! Eug. Oh name her not! To my own heart I dare not breathe my love. I am the creature of her father's bounty. Yet were I lord of kingdoms—nay, of worlds,— To ask the love of Margaret would seem As though I bade the silver queen of night Curtain her beams from every other eye, To shine on me alone. St. Lo. I've seen the moon Shine brighter on a puddle than an ocean! And women love that best on which their love Can show most liberal.—Do you still doubt? Then look at me!—I'll go and woo your sister More hotly now than ever.—Follow me! And, as I prosper, make me your example. Eug. [Laughing.] You an example! St. Lo. And why not, good friend? What wins a widow will not lose a maid! [Exeunt, R. SCENE II. —A Chamber in Matthew Elmore's House, with preparations for a toilette. Jenny discovered arranging the dressing-table, R. Jenny. Well! I like France—and so does my young lady, Miss Margaret, too, I warrant! Why, though we have been here only a couple of months, I feel just as if I had been born a Frenchwoman—gentility comes so naturally to me! In England, Tom the coachman used to call me pretty Jenny Jarman. Poor Tom!—But Jenny Jarman! What a horrid name! Now, Monsieur Friponneau, the valet, whispers to me—Ah belle Anatole Charmant! Charmant means charming, which he says I am, both by name and by nature; and Anatole, he tells me, is the French for Jenny. How much nicer it sounds!—Anatole Charmant—Jenny Jarman! Oh there is no sort of comparison between them!—But kark! I hear my young lady's voice.—Ay, and there is Madame de Vermont with her as usual. What a comfort it is to see a widow always so gay and merry! really it is quite a temptation to marriage! Enter Margaret and Herminie de Vermont, R. D. F. Mar. I have been idle, and the morning wears: I shall be chid for my late toilette. Come, We must make haste, good Jenny! Jenny. Anatole, if you please, Mamselle, from this out.— I have been translated. Mar. Translated! Jenny. Yes. Anatole is the French for Jenny; and as all our other English has to be translated, Monsieur Friponneau has persuaded me to undergo the operation too. Mar. [Laughing.] Beware, girl! for they teach false lessons here, And we are too apt scholars. Jenny. Oh, but the masters are so pleasant!—And all alike. Why, lovers in France are as plentiful as sprats at Christmas; while England is like a ship on short allowance —there is not one for half-a-dozen of us! Mar. Fie, fie, girl! To your task. I shall be late. You know, my father's love, which makes of me The unskilled mistress of his house, demands I should receive his friends. Her. (L. C.) Your father's friends! Thou little hypocrite! Where did they hide Before your father's daughter came? Till then No man had fewer; but with Margaret They flocked as thick as swallows with the summer; Till, in a month, good, quiet, peaceful Elmore Found himself master of the destinies Of half the raving, moon-struck youths of Paris. Thanks to that duteous daughter, whose sole care Was—to do honour to her father's friends! Mar. Go to! You are an idle chatterer. Her. Do you weary of me? Mar. No—talk on—talk on— I'll think of other things. Enter Page, L. Page. Monsieur Lafont Presents his humble duty to you, Madam, And waits below. Mar. I am not ready yet For visitors—so tell Monsieur Lafont. [Exit Page, L. Her. Oh, my poor guardian!—Why, thou saucy girl, So short an answer to so rich a wooer! Mar. Wooer!—Oh, wherefore will he thus persist In this most monstrous suit?—Why haunt a house Where no one welcomes him? Her. Two strong attractions, Beauty and wealth. Lafont adores them both. Besides, your father is his rival now In trade; but this would make their interests one. How they could play into each other's hands! What snug monopolies! Oh, he will win you! You are your father's goods—his stock in trade; The merchant sells his wares to the best chapman— And few can bid a price with Paul Lafont. How I should like to hear them haggling for you! Mar. Stay, Herminie! I know you do but jest— Yet there are themes on which a jest appears A kind of irreligion. One of these Is my dear father's name. Unworthy doubt Never approached it—never! If his heart Has any worship lower than the skies, It is his honour; if he has a thought Still dearer than that honour, 'tis his child. Her. Forgive me—I but jested on Lafont. Mar. Name him no more. I should despise him, were it But for your own and for your brother's wrongs: Yet in himself there's that—I scarce know what— Which makes me shrink from him. His bonied sweetness Moves my aversion—his eternal smoothness Wakes my antipathy. I think I see A coiled up serpent in his half closed eye: It may be prejudice, yet, Herminie, I'd rather meet my father's sternest frown, Than Paul Lafont's smooth smile. Her. Come to my arms, And let me kiss thee! Re-enter Page, L. Page. Count D'Autun, my lady, Tenders his service. Mar. I will come anon. [Exit Page, L. Her. D'Autun. Now there's a gallant that is rich, Generous, young, well featured, well proportioned— A very pearl of men. How's the heart now? Is there no palpitation? Mar. [Extending her arm.] Feel my pulse. Her. [Taking it.] One—two—three—four—a most provoking pulse! Firm as a rock—dull as the step of time. Oh, I am out of patience! Margaret, Like a good girl, come, make a full confession! I die to know the truth—who is the man? Mar. Psha! not a soul of them. Her. Stay—that's a fib! I see a blush—a little crinkling smile! Desanges?—still steady! Mar. Ay—or it beats false. Her. Rochard?—Now whip that little wrist of thine. This is a piece of clockwork, not a pulse! It stirs no more for the best men in Paris, Than if I named my brother, poor Eugene— Oh, mercy on us! what a leap was there! And what a blush! You're ill—extremely ill! My wicked brother! It was he— Mar. Go, madcap! [Rising. Girl, you have surely finished— Jenny. Oh, your hair— Mar. My hair is excellent, I have no doubt. Jenny. And that left sleeve— Mar. Quite right—the sleeve's perfection. There—any thing will do! I am not used, You know, to be fastidious in my dress. Re-enter Page, L. Page. The Sieur Eugene, my lady, is below. Mar. [Eagerly.] Ha! say I'm coming—that is, presently. No—never mind. There, there—you need not wait. [Exit Page, L. Her. My brother! Oh, you must not venture near him. You know his very name alarmed you! Nay, Indeed you must not—'twill be dangerous! Stay where you are. Mar. [Going to a glass.] Oh, you provoking girl! How ill you've dressed me! never half so badly! This hair is frightful—do it all again— Yet that will take so long— Her. Nay, but you know, “My hair is excellent!” Mar. And then this sleeve— See how it hangs! Her. “The sleeve's perfection!” Mar. Psha! Why, look yourself—the dress is all awry— I cannot be seen thus! Her. “I am not used To be fastidious in my dress!”—Dear Margaret, I must embrace you! Nay, don't turn away! Never did book delight me half so much, As that most simple one in which I read Thy heart! Mar. You are a simpleton yourself! Like an ambitious child, who knows not yet A single letter, you would seize the volume, Turn the page upside down, and so pretend To read its matter. Fiction—all pure fiction, Framed out of your own brain! [To Jenny.]—There, you may go, girl. Jenny. [Aside.] Go!—yes, that's always the way, just as the conversation is growing interesting! But as long as doors are made with key-holes, I'll not be brought up in ignorance! [Flounces out, R. Mar. And I must hasten now to meet these people, If but to 'scape from you. Ha! here's my father— Now I shall have a champion! Enter Matthew Elmore, L. D. F. Elm. [Entering.] So thou shalt! [Embraces her. Why, what's the matter, girl? Why, Margaret! As full of blushes as the morning, when The sun peeps in through her half opened curtains, And finds her sleeping! What has happened, child? What have they done to thee? Mar. Oh, she torments me With saucy jests, such as one's cheek can't choose But tingle at. Forbid her! Her. [Laughing.] Don't attempt it! I will not be forbid— Elm. Yes, Herminie, You will. You know the jealous care with which I watch my budding rose—grown far away, In bleak but wholesome air; transplanted now Into this rank and doubtful soil of France, Because my selfish fondness could not bear That it should bloom away from me. I'd have her Gay, happy, courted, and admired; but yet I must not let you spoil my English girl! Mar. [Affectionately.] Nor shall they, father! Am I not with you, And is not that always to be at home? The truant slip, that once was severed from you, Now, grafted back into the parent stem, Grows all again your own. Elm. [Regarding her earnestly.] Art sure of that? Art sure thou art not, like so many more, A parasite, twining about my boughs, Only to feed upon my sap? Mar. Oh, no! I am your own true branch. Elm. Beware, beware! This world we live in, child—'tis a strange world— And, like a cur, will snap at the same hand It licked an hour before. If this same world— It is a giddy thing—which fawns so now, Should one day turn on me—if it should find My gold but tinsel—call my seeming virtue Smooth-faced hypocrisy—brand my proud name With its most damning marks—think'st thou, would still Thy fond affection know no cooling? Mar. No! If such could be—though such can never be— Then I would fly that world with thee, and go Where we would have no world but one another. But why do you so often in your talk Start off to doubts and questionings like these? Elm. Do I? I did not know it. 'Tis perhaps That love is jealous—restless; not content To be loved as we are, we seek assurance We should be loved no less if we were other. Love is not reason—yet I think thou lovest me? Mar. And I'll be sworn I do! Her. And I'll be sworn She wishes you a thousand leagues away, E'en while she tells you so! Have you forgot What sighing suitors wait for her below? Elm. [Smiling.] In truth I had! Well, child, thou hast the choice Of some of the most gentle blood of France. Her. Choice! Give a maid a choice!—The good man doats! Why, ev'n a widow scarcely gets as much! Oh, this is heresy against all custom! Elm. Then we will make new customs, Herminie. If I would buy my child a house, a horse, A trinket, bauble—should I not consult Her taste on what would pleasure her?—and yet Might each be soon exchanged if she disliked it. Or if I would bring home some youthful friend, As her companion for a vacant hour, Should she not have a voice in what should be The character of that selected friend? Yet might she snap at will the slender tie. Then, when the question is of one to be The partner of her life to its last breath, The sharer of her heart's most sacred thoughts, The breast in which her own should pour its joys, Or rest its griefs—for grief will come to all— The altar of her home—her other self— The substitute for all the outer world, For which the outer world must be resigned Without a sigh: in such a gift as this, Shall my girl have no voice? Mar. My own best father! Elm. Come! We will go and meet these wooers, child. I'll ask no wealth but that more pure than gold— An honest heart; and thou canst choose no other. Her. Be not too sure of that! Lovers are made Like pastry—all with tempting outside crusts; But what they have within we can but guess Till we begin to taste—a privilege Never allowed us till they're bought and paid for! [Exeunt, L. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A Court before Elmore's House. Enter Eugene de Lorme, from the house, L. F. Eug. (L.) I cannot stay within!—It drives me mad To see them clustering round her, and to hear Their glib tongues chattering their shallow vows; While I, who love her with a depth of love That might engulph them all, can speak no word, But stifle in my fulness. They can offer— Ay, even the meanest—rank and wealth; while I Have less than nothing, for whate'er I have, Is filched from stores that else were all her own. Oh poverty, past poverty! Enter Friar Dominic, R. U. E. Friar. 'Tis here, then, This merchant Elmore revels; and 'tis here The latest scion of a line of nobles Takes his inglorious rest. Ha! Is not yon The boy himself?—alone, too: that is well. But why this sunken aspect? Does he feel The enervating bond that circles him? Is nature true, in spite of circumstance? Does subtle instinct rise and bid him hate The hand from which he feeds? Eug. [Perceiving him.] Your blessing, father. Desire you aught in which you may be furthered By one who has some influence in this house? Friar. [Aside.] Some influence in this house! He boasts his thraldom! His thoughts are sunk and abject as his state. Peace to Eugene—the nameless! Eug. Stay, good friar! To know me as Eugene, at least should argue An equal knowledge of that other title My ancestors bequeathed. I am not nameless, But called Eugene de Lorme. Friar. Fie, fie, young braggart! I knew De Lorme, whom thou would'st claim for father, And knew him as a man of haughty soul, And pride untameable: his boiling blood Could never so cool down in one remove, As with this sluggish pace to creep content In a dependent's veins. Eug. Dependent, sir!— You say you knew my father: knew you, too. His early death—my orphaned infancy— The doubtful guardianship that seized my means? Friar. Something of this, too, reached my distant convent. But when its business called me here to Paris, And I sought out the children of my friend, I thought to find a stubborn courage striving With an opposing fate; and ready, like The olden giants, to tear from their bases Even rocks and mountains—so they might pile up A road to reach the persecuting gods. Eug. I pray you, mock not thus my helpless state. Perhaps my nature owns a higher flight, But I have had my pinions early clipt, And have been made familiar with the perch. Friar. The eagle's egg breeds nothing but an eagle, Hatch it whene'er you may. Could a De Lorme Believe that he was wrong'd, yet calmly leave The wrong unchallenged? Eug. What could I effect Against my guardian's wealth? Friar. What hast thou tried? Nothing!—Oh, thou rare puppet for these knaves To play with!—Of endurance past belief! But, stalled and crammed to drowsy lethargy, How could I think a common wrong could move thee, When even thy father's murder cannot stir Thy sluggish phlegm: but his assassin roves The world, unsought for! Eug. Not so, sir. The man Who took my father's life—the Count du Barré— Scarcely survived his victim. Friar. Who says so? Eug. The ship in which he fled from human justice, Was tracked by the divine; and on her way Foundered and sank. Friar. Who tells thee so, I ask? Eug. Common report. Friar. I'll bring thee new report, Better than common! I have travelled much, And I report to thee, Du Barré lives! Eug. Where? Friar. Not too distant for a son's revenge, Though 'twere at the antipodes. Eug. Yet where? Friar. Tush! what imports it thee? Thou darest not seek him. Eug. I dare not! Who shall stay me? Friar. Who? Thy patron— Thy merchant patron! That same crafty trader, Who tames so cunningly the noble's brood. Eug. Thou would'st not speak of Elmore! Friar. Ay, of Elmore— The subtle, specious Elmore. Eug. [Turning away.] Then thou'rt mad! Friar. Not mad, thou doting boy! And yet I say, The crafty Elmore—he whose subtle arts Have wound their numbing influence around thee, 'Till every generous resolve is palsied. His seeming bounties are but tricks— Eug. Hold, sir! Though your words sorted ill with a profession Which teaches pardon, not revenge of wrongs, I yet endured your speech so far unchecked. Because you called yourself my father's friend. But now I tell thee, he whose venomed life Slanders with but a breath the name of Elmore, Grows, from that moment, to my enemy. Friar. Infatuated boy! Eug. Peace, peace, I say! Some foe of mine has set you on to this, To rob me of my last remaining prop. Friar. Wilt thou be blind to proof? Eug. I tell thee, monk, Though that which seemed to my own sense most just, Were backed by every other tongue on earth, With Elmore's only to the contrary, I would call Elmore right, and all the world, With my own judgment, wrong! Friar. Then thou'rt past cure, Of all but sharp experience; and to that I'll leave thee. Thou wilt one day learn thine error, And know me better. We shall meet again. [Exit, L. Eug. Better! I know thee now, and well enough; I know thee for a busy, meddling monk— Some agent of Lafont's. 'Tis like his art! And yet he rail'd against my guardian, too! A cloak!—a cloak to hide the deeper purpose! Yet part he said was truth—I am too sluggish— Submit too grossly to the worst of wrongs, And live content in ignominious ease, Till e'en a stranger feels a right to taunt me With biting comments. I will speak with Elmore, And he shall guide me. Yes, I'll speak with Elmore. Enter Elmore, from the house, L. Elm. Eugene, my child, why do I find thee thus Shunning society, to brood alone on Thoughts that do not make me their companion? I deemed thy heart was mine. Eug. And so it is: Alas, 'tis all I have to offer you, That was not your's before it was my own! Oh, Elmore, I am far too much your debtor! The weight of obligation bows me down, I cannot meet with independent brow The bold eyes of the world, where every man Is rightful heir or maker of his means, And holds them without blushing. I alone Live upon sufferance—on charity! Elm. What phantasy is this?—Who tells thee go? Eug. All I encounter: all look down upon me— The harsh with scorn, the gentle with compassion; Yet still all do look down—and some proud blood Which I inherit—prouder than my fortunes— Rebels against it. Elm. What would'st thou desire? Eug. To right myself, and call my plunderer To an account. Elm. Tut, tut, thou silly boy! Canst thou believe a puny arm like thine Could shake Lafont? Eug. Ay, in a righteous quarrel! There lies a hidden strength in a just cause, That nothing can resist. The Syracusan Boasted, had he but where to fix his levers, He'd move the earth:—a righteous cause does more— Fixed on the earth, it sways the heaven itself, And bows it to its aid! Elm. No more—no more! I will not hear of this! What would'st thou ask, More than thou hast? What is there thou could'st win From Paul Lafont, that Elmore has denied thee? What have I left undone? I have grudged thee nothing; Have lavished freely on thee every pleasure The pulse of youth could pant for; have allowed thee Means without limit: say, what is there more I still can give, and I will give it still? Eug. Nothing: I ask not bounty, but my rights. Oh, Elmore, pause ere you forbid my efforts! Reflect how thus, to a censorious world, You seem to cast a shield over my foes, And draw suspicion even on yourself. Elm. Suspicion! what suspicion? What is this? Who has been tampering with thee? Oh, my child! As thou would'st prize thy young heart's dearest peace, Guard from thy breast that moral pestilence! Suspicion, like the fabled upas, blights All healthy life, and makes a desert round it. Nothing so fair, nothing so pure can live, But by suspicion may be marred and blasted; No path so straight, but to suspicion's eye Looks tortuous and bent from its true end; Away with it!—We know it not in youth, When we come freshest from the hand of heaven. It is an earth-engendered monster, springing From the rank slime of our polluted years. Oh, better be, in trust o'er-confident, A thousand times deceived, than wrongly once Wound with ungenerous doubt the breast of truth! Eug. Then why— Elm. [Impatiently.] Why?—Boy, must I lay bare to thee My merchant heart, and show its hidden weakness? Canst thou not see, without express confession, That peace is necessary to the trade By which I live?—that I must not make foes, And least of all of men like this Lafont; Whose cunning, wealth, connexions, influence— Eug. Stay! This is the first time I have ever heard A selfish word issue from Elmore's lips; And I would spare myself the shame to think I forced it from him— Elm. Boy—unfeeling boy! Thou dost not know my state. In the world's crowd I stand alone—an isolated man Amidst a land of strangers. True I have Dependents, flatterers, needy hangers-on: But yet, among them all, there is not one, No, not a man of them, whose eager eye Keeps not a jealous watch upon my steps: There is not one whose heart would not rejoice To see me stumble on my dizzy height, Because I am a stranger, and have grown To wealth beyond their own.—I have a child, too, Whose tender helplessness I must protect— Eug. No more—no more, sir,—Call me satisfied:— I blush to think I should have moved you thus. Elm. Dost think I ask thee to forego thy right For my advantage?—Name the utmost sum Thou deem'st thy guardian has withheld from thee— Calculate freely—give thy fancy rein— And if it lie within my farthest means— Eug. What do you think me, Elmore? Elm. Nothing worse Than all the other world.—There was a time I thought thee something better.—Do I pain thee?— Nay, then, forgive me!—I am fretful—peevish— I know I am—but there are things that vex me Beyond my calmer self—and this is one. Give me thy hand! So—we are friends again. And now, as I refused thee a request— I think for the first time—find out some other With which I may content thee. Do not fear To ask a large one—for I doubt if now There rests that thing I own upon the earth Which thou canst ask, and I deny to thee. Come—thou hast still a wish! Eug. [Hesitating.] I have. Elm. [Smiling.] I knew it! [Aside.] His timid love shrinks even from the sound Of its own breath! but Margaret's heart already Has heard and answered it. [Aloud.] Well! what's the wish— That secret wish thou hoard'st so jealously? Fearest thou to speak? Eug. My father's murderer— Elm. [Starting.] What! [Passionately.] Now by my life some has set thee on! I know there has—Who is it who has toiled To wreck thy peace on all these rocks of strife? Stay!—I remember now, as I came down, I saw a Gray Franciscan quit the court— 'Twas he! Eug. How! Do you know him? Elm. No—But once To-day we met before—and then he stopped And whispered one beside him—when his eye Shot such a glance on mine, that the quick instinct Which wakes antipathies within our blood, Told me he was a man to shun. Eug. That's strange! For he declared himself my father's friend. Elm. A trick to win thy confidence! Eug. And said, Du Barré, the assassin of my father, Still lived— Elm. Ha!—What!—Du Barré lived!—Thou'rt mad! A thousand tongues will certify his death! [Checking himself.] And even if he lives, what is't to thee? Is it for thee to snatch the hangman's office? How canst thou tell what bitter provocation May have impelled the deed? Eug. Shall provocation Be found to justify a murder? Elm. Thou thyself; Dost thou not seek a life—and what hast thou To plead but provocation? Eug. Blood for blood! A murdered father to his child bequeaths A holy legacy in his revenge. Elm. Fie! fie! Shall twenty years not quench this thirst? I thought I had reared thee better. Thou, who own'st All blessings that affection can heap on thee, Canst thou not rest content in their enjoyment, Unless thou may'st hunt down a wretched outcast, Proscribed of all the world—who, if he lives, As they would have thee think—lives steeped in fears, Listening in terror to each passing sound By the light ear of innocence unheeded?— Believest thou, oh thou thoughtless boy, that guilt, So it escape detection, walks in peace? Dost know—canst dream what 'tis to take a life? To feel the curse of Cain upon thy steps— To meet the blood-glazed eye in every object— To hear the dying groan in every sound? For years—years—years—to start from restless sleep, And find the phantom standing by thy bed? Go where thou wilt, to bear about with thee A hidden wolf gnawing thy shrinking entrails— Eug. Hold—hold!—The passion of these burning words Curdles my blood— Elm. Passion!—no, boy—not passion. I am calm—quite calm.—I did but reason with thee As of an unknown wretch, whose state might ask More pity than abhorrence. Eug. Let him live! A life like this is penalty enough. Elm. Ha! That's my own Eugene again! This Friar Shall miss his aim. Eug. This Friar! Elm. Ay, this Friar!— Dost thou not see he thought, by setting thee On some vain, endless quest, to sever us? But, as the traveller, when the tempest blows, Girds his cloak tightlier round him,—so we, Since plots against us are abroad, will knit A closer bond!—Eugene, thou lovest my daughter— Nay, do not start—it is no crime to love. Eug. I thought it so—and wrestled with my heart. But now its secret's told, why should I hide, That love of parents, station, fortune, friends, Hope, life itself, is weak and feeble love, To that I bear to Margaret. Elm. [Smiling.] Poor boy! And didst thou think a passion so absorbing Could lie concealed? I saw it from the first,— Saw it with joy, reflecting my own wish. Eug. Elmore, you would not mock me! Elm. Mock thee, boy! It was a thought I nursed from the beginning— Eug. From the beginning! Elm. Ay—from the beginning Of that more perfect knowledge of thy worth That knew thy heart—which—not the outward station Is the true man.—But still, for Margaret, I left her free to choose—gave her full scope To draw comparisons betwixt thyself And the best youth of France—allowed free access To every wooer—'twas a right I owed her— But now— Eug. [Eagerly.] What now? Oh do not torture me! Elm. [Smiling.] Go question for thyself.—I am no tell-tale Of maidens' secrets.—Yet thou shalt behold I will dismiss, and with her own consent, Every remaining suitor, to content thee! Eug. Oh speak not lightly, Elmore! for thy words Open a glimpse of such an unthought heaven, That if it vanish now, my bursting heart Will break with the illusion. Elm. 'Twill not vanish!— There—grasp my hand!—'Tis substance, is it not? Yet not more substance than thy promised joy! But come with me—I see thou'lt not believe Till Margaret's lips shall certify my words. Oh now my labouring hope draws near a birth! No longer orphaned, thou shalt find a father, Whose love shall make thee lord of greater riches Than e'er thine own could have bequeathed to thee. My Margaret's self shall be the precious bond To bind our hearts, souls, hopes, homes, all in one; And thou shalt cease to mourn a father lost, In rich content of such a father found! [Exeunt into house, L. F. SCENE II. —The Garden of Elmore's House. Enter Herminie and St. Lo, R. St. Lo. Nay, Herminie, be reasonable! Her. No— I'll be content with nothing less. Lafont Has made the offer, and you shall accept it. Yes, you shall be—[Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha!—his clerk! St. Lo. I'd rather be a hawk on a barn door, Nailed through my outstretched wings! He's still a hawk, And looks respectable. I'd sooner give My racehorse limbs into a sand-cart's harness— For then I might believe I showed at least An interesting wreck of better days. I'd sooner be a cur, and turn a spit; For then I'd swear in every revolution I served the common weal! I'd sooner be— Her. Anything sooner than what I command you. Well, well, good sir—you brought your love to market, I should not else have thought of bidding for it. I've named my price—it is not yours—and so We part without a bargain—Fare you well! St. Lo. Stay, Herminie! I love you with a passion— Her. Of course you do! I never knew a lover But swore as much! But passions are cheap things, Common as nuts, and just as often rotten. Give me obedience—give me deeds. St. Lo. —Ask something In reason then. Her. Ask, sir!—I did not ask— I ordered you! St. Lo. Then order me some task A gentleman may undertake!—Command me To cut a throat—join a conspiracy— Get up a revolution—shoot Lafont— Turn the world topsy-turvy. Her. Pooh—pooh—pooh! I want not a knight errant!—I have only One modest longing—one intense desire. St. Lo. Name it! Her. A clerk!—a gentle, smug-faced clerk! His pen behind his ear—rubbing his hands— With—“What can I supply your noble worship?” Oh I do languish for a clerk! St. Lo. You'll drive me To madness! Her. 'Twill be only a short drive— You're half way there already. St. Lo. Herminie! Her. If I am worth the winning, you have heard The only terms on which I can be won. St. Lo. What have I done that can deserve such rigour? Her. What have you done! A thousand naughty things! You've kept bad company—drunk—gambled—sworn— Wasted your means—ruined five honest tailors— Enriched my guardian— St. Lo. Spare me! Her. From which courses There's such a rank contagion all around you, That, as you are, I dare not let you near me. You must be fumigated—purified! You say you have forsook these sins—I doubt you. But here I offer you the means of proof, Where you may fly temptation, and achieve An honest bread. St. Lo. And you are absolute? Her. Fixed as the centre. St. Lo. And you will not change? Her. Not though I lived an age! St. Lo. You'll really have me Be clerk to Paul Lafont? Her. Paul Lafont's clerk, And nothing else. St. Lo. [After a pause.] Why, then I'll do it!— Her. You will? St. Lo. I will! Her. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! ha!—Then I'll indeed Believe you are sincere. St. Lo. But afterwards You'll marry me? Her. Marry you!—I'll do more— I'll love you!—[Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! St. Lo. Now will you, though? Her. Yes, that I will!—[Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! ha! St. Lo. Don't laugh! Her. How can I help it? St. Lo. Oh, I know there'll be Laughing enough at this—But Herminie, Pray don't you laugh so! Hark! there's some one coming, Don't laugh!—I shall have need of all my courage. Enter Eugene de Lorme, R. Eug. Joy! joy, my sister! Joy, my best St. Lo! There is not air enough for me to breathe My suffocating bliss! Her. Why, what's the matter? Eug. She's mine! My own eyes saw them all dismissed. The jewel that the world contended for Is placed within my hand, to hold for ever! Her. He's mad!—What jewel?—Who's dismissed? Eug. What jewel? Margaret!—Who dismissed?—Her suitors—all— Oh, where shall my full heart find love enough To pay this matchless Elmore? Her. All dismissed! Lafont, too? Eug. Ay— Her. Oh this is exquisite! What a delightful mood he will be in For his new clerk! Eug. But how is this, St. Lo? No word of welcome for my happiness? Is this your boasted friendship? St. Lo. Hold your tongue! I've got my own affairs. Did you not hear her? Lafont's new clerk—that's me! Eug. You! Her. Peace, good brother! It is my will—I'll have no interference! St. Lo. She's rock, Eugene! flint—granite! Her. Hush! See yonder, Your master's coming! Dear, how kind he looks! Oh, how the world will envy you your service! Enter Lafont, R. Laf. [Aside.] Dismissed! rejected by this upstart And his young chit! and no revenge at hand! That princely fortune missed; and, more than that, The greater fortune which it should have led to— And now all lost! Her. [Advancing.] Oh, my poor ill-used guardian! Is this news true? Laf. Ha! pretty Herminie! My dear Eugene, too! Let me kiss your cheek. [Aside.] Curse her—she knows it all! Eug. Peace, sweetest sister! I am too happy now to find more joy In an ungenerous triumph. [To Lafont.] There's my hand, Lafont, there has been enmity between us, But henceforth let it cease. I'll call all paid By the bright transport of this happy hour. Laf. How very kind! Hm! Quite magnanimous! Eug. For Elmore's sake, I have forgiven all. Laf. Dear Elmore! What I owe him! Her. Can such trifles Move one of your philosophy—and years? Laf. [Aside.] How I detest that woman! St. Lo. [Aside.] A young devil! She's doing all she can to drive him mad, Before I enter service! Her. [To Lafont.] Oh, sir, yonder Stands a young man who comes to seek your worship. He says he is engaged to be your clerk. Here, sir—come forward. So, hold up your head. And speak out like a man! St. Lo. [Aside.] Upon my soul, I shall break down; I never can endure it! Laf. What, my sweet friend, St. Lo! I am delighted! Her. Your clerk, sir. Laf. Oh, a little jest this morning, But nothing more. You know, my dear St. Lo, You are not fit— Her. Not fit! He'll be a treasure! So prudent, so industrious, so careful! And you, sir [To St. Lo.] you will find in your new master Such honour, such integrity, such virtue, Such liberality, such—[Laughing.] Ha, ha! ha, ha, ha! Oh, you were made for one another! Laf. [Aside.] Hm! Is there no aconite—no deadly nightshade— No arsenic—no henbane—no quick drug, To poison the whole batch? St. Lo. Yes, I'm resolved— I'll become learned in the mysteries Of tallow, stock-fish, blubber, salt, train oil, And all your filthy messes—go to school— Recover my lost tables—learn the sum That two and two amount to—stick a pen Behind my ear—perch on a high-legged stool, And bore my nose into your mighty ledgers! Oh, you shall find me such a paragon, That, when I die, you shall embalm my body, And hang me up—the counting-house's pride, And model for succeeding generations! Laf. [Aside.] I'd rather hang you first! Her. [To Lafont.] He waits your orders. Laf. Then home, sir, home!—since you must fasten on me— That is—we'll home at once, my dear St. Lo! [Aside.] I'm mocked at! fooled!—[Aloud.] My charming Herminie! My sweet Eugene, farewell!—[Aside.] Ugh! devils! vipers! [Exit, L. Her. He's furious! raving! St. Lo. Thank you! Her. [Laughing.] Ha, ha, ha! Oh, you will lead a happy life together! Eug. St. Lo, you shall not perpetrate this folly. Her. He shall—or he shall never be my husband! Be grateful for the course of your own wooing, And let me manage mine, good brother! St. Lo. Nay, She'll have her way; so good bye, pleasant world! You will look in on me, though, now and then? Her. Perhaps I may. Good bye! St. Lo. [Sighing.] Good bye! Her. [Imitating him.] Good bye! There—you may kiss my hand. Stop! that's enough. Eug. Farewell, my poor Saint Lo! Her. Your master's waiting. St. Lo. Torturer!—Angel! Bah! give me my pen. [Rushes out, R.—Exeunt, Eugene and Herminie, L. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —An Office in Lafont's House. Jean Ruse discovered at a desk, L. Jean. [Groaning] Oh! to a man of any moral feeling, It's a sad, wicked world! Two and three's five— One's six—three's nine—nine hundred and fourteen. That four's just like a seven! I should not wonder If they would call it seven, and pay it so! And if they should, those three shall be my own. A rascal world!—None but the little pickings Come to my pocket—all the big are his. I hate him! hate them all! Now, where's the next? Twelve hundred—hem!—and five. Only and five! I wonder if that naught would bear a tail? A little dash? It's very like a six! They'll call it sixty-five, if they don't cast it; And if they do, it's but an ill-made naught! Figures should never be too plain. Who's next? So, Master Gaudry!—lost your quittance, have you? But sure you paid the bill? I choose to doubt it. Pay it again, my friend! Ha, ha! you'll be Another time more careful of your papers! A shocking world! Nothing but carelessness! People must pay for it, or they'll not mend! Enter Manou, R. U. E. Man. So! there he sits! Now, here's a pretty task That madcap Herminie has set me on! To guard the morals of her poor St. Lo, And watch that they don't spoil him! To begin, I must make friends with that old crab-face yonder. Will that be hard? We'll see!—Hem! Jean Rusé! Jean. [Looking up.] Manou! how's this? What are you doing here? You're out of bounds! What would your master say? Man. Master 'll say nothing—for he's closeted With a strange Friar; and orders have been given That no one shall disturb them. He'll not know it. Jean. Closeted with a Friar! Paul Lafont! In five and thirty years I never heard Of such a thing! Man. Perhaps he's come to shrive him— Jean. [Aside.] To shrive him! [Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi! If that's the case, They'll be some time indeed; for Paul must have Run up, by this, a pretty long account! Man. And so, Jean, as I found it very dull In my own room, I naturally thought That you, down here, must be but lonely, too. Jean. That's very kind of you! [Aside.] Now she wants something, I know she does! She never speaks so kindly, But when she's a design to wheedle me! Man. And so, I brought with me a little bottle Of the best wine— Jean. [Looking up.] Eh! stop! that's rational. Man. Your work must be so dull. Jean. It is—it is! And melancholy, too—a sad, sad world! Nothing but knavery, Madame Manou! All trying how to cheat us! You've a glass? [Manou pours him out a glass of wine. Yes—a sad world! My service to you, ma'am! [Drinks. That's capital good wine! Man. I know it, Jean; And that was why I brought it. Jean. [Aside.] She can be A very pleasant woman when she likes! Capital wine! Man. Come, try another glass! [Filling one. You don't get the full flavour out of one. Jean. Really you press me so. [Drinks.] And, as you say, The flavour does improve. But, la! you're standing! I've nothing here to offer but a stool. Man. Let it be your's, and I'll feel honoured by it. Jean. [Aside.] How monstrous kind! Oh, she was something from me— I wonder what it is! But she shan't get it— No—I'm too much for her. I'm close—close—close! [Places two high stools side by side, and they sit. Man. There, now I call that snug! Jean. [Pouring himself out another glass, and drinking.] Amazing snug! [Then, looking at her. You're really an uncommonly nice woman! A very nice!—so sleek, so comfortable! Man. Housekeepers should be sleek and comfortable. The housekeeper should be a sort of sign To show what living's had within the house. Jean. [Sighing.] Happy housekeepers! But the clerk, Manou— He is a sort of sign to show what life Is in the counting-house! Like his own pen, Thin, dry, and peaked! Man. [Filling his glass.] Take a dip of ink, then! Jean. Hi! hi! That's very good! I will—I will. Ah, Manou! You are like the juicy joint, [Drinks. And I only the skewer! Man. [Aside.] He's making love! If that's the wind, I'll hoist another sail: Jean, you are dull! [Pours out another glass. Jean. Now don't—pray don't, Manou! I am not used to wine and such strong drinks! Now, really! [Drinks.] There's a warmth about my heart. I feel so odd! [Taking Manou's hand.] What a soft, pretty hand! How smooth and fat! Quite a round hand, I swear! Man. [Coquettishly.] A pity it has got no master—an't it? [St. Lo appears behind, from L. U. E. watching them with evident amusement. Jean. Dear, I feel very bold! Quite, quite courageous! That hand no master, beautiful Manou! Kings might be proud—hem! and in all these years, No doubt you have contrived to lay by something? Man. [Carelessly.] A thousand crowns or so! Jean. [Aside.] A thousand crowns! Dear, dear, what lovely opportunities She must have had for cheating! Man. You, too, Jean— I wager now you have got something, too? Jean. Hm!—why, why, yes—I won't say much of money; We merchants don't let capital lie idle. But I've got something—[Laughing.] Hi! hi! I've got secrets, Worth more than money, if I dared but use them. Man. Secrets! Oh, tell me what they are! Jean [Chuckling.] Stop, stop! Time enough when we're married! [Laughing.] Hi, hi, hi! Man. Another glass, Jean? [Filling it. Jean. Thank ye. [Drinks. Man. But at least, Where are they kept? Jean. [Pointing.] There! Master's private closet! I've got—[Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi!—I've got a second key That opens it! Man. And all his secrets! Jean. Hush! Of course I found it—quite an accident— But it exactly fits! Man. I'm a weak woman! Jean, woo me with that key, and I believe I shall be won. Jean. The thousand crowns and all? Man. Twelve hundred crowns! Jean. Twelve hundred!—Oh, I yield! [Falls on his knees. Lovely Manou!— [St. Lo advances, and throws his arms round Manou's neck. St. Lo. The first kiss of the bride! Man. [Starting up.] La! how you made me jump!—This is the youth Whose morals I'm to guard! St. Lo. Brave wench,—another! [Whispers her.] Obtain that key! It may unlock the way To knaveries past thought. For the dear sake Of Herminie, obtain it! Jean. [Recovering himself.] Why, what's this! Do you know, young man, this is the private room. St. Lo. [Slapping him on the shoulder.] Old boy, it looks so! [Points to the bottle and Manou. Jean. [Aside.] Did he hear, I wonder? I've been a fool— St. Lo. Come, come—no sulky faces! I'll not tell tales. We're friends, Jean—fellow clerks. We must be brothers! Jean. What a funny boy! St. Lo. One bottle! Psha! We'll drain a dozen dry To our new friendship—won't we, honest Jean! You shall be jolly! Jean. [Hesitating.] I was never jolly In all my life. St. Lo. We'll to the cellar, Jean! Jean. My virtue trembles! It's a wicked world— But he's a funny boy! St. Lo. Shan't we be friends? Jean. I think so. St. Lo. Brothers? Jean. Brothers. Man. Then embrace! Jean. I will—and then I'll embrace you, Manou. St. Lo. We'll have a rouse! Jean. We will!—we'll have a rouse! La! what will master say? Man. Hang master. St. Lo. Draw him! Jean. Quarter him!—[Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi!—We'll have a rouse! I will be jolly then! St. Lo. [Taking his arm.] So!—To the cellar! Jean. It's very shocking, drinking master's wine, though! It's a sad—no! no!—it's a funny world! [Exeunt, L. SCENE II. —An elegant Apartment in Elmore's House. Margaret seated R., embroidering—Eugene leaning over, and whispering with her.—Elmore seated on the opposite side at a table, L., with a book in his hand, but his eyes fixed upon them—discovered. Elm. Yes, they are happy!—who can look and doubt it? Happy in mutual affection—happy In guileless hearts, in youthful innocence, That, with a cloudless sky above its head, Sees nothing in the future for a fear, Nor in the past for a regret. Oh, blest Beyond all earthly bliss! Why, when I see Such happiness in those I love the best, Why sinks my heart in this unnatural dulness? That Friar—I have tracked him to Lafont's— What should he there? Tush! this is folly—weakness! Why should he not go there? What is't to me? I will not think of him—and yet 'tis strange! [Resumes his book. Eug. [To Margaret.] Marvellous art—and marvellously plied! To watch those fairy fingers rove the canvass; They show like Flora's footsteps through the fields, Dropping a flower at every touch. Could nature Behold her rival here, she'd blush to find Her craft not only stolen, but exceeded In the new execution. Mar. Out, you flatterer! I do but mock, not copy nature's cunning. Here is the form—but where's the dewy freshness? The hues are here—but where is the perfume? I'll work no more. [Rising.] It is a foolish labour— I like not counterfeits in any shape! Eug. And yet how often they outlive the real! The fine and delicately organised, Or flowers or hearts droop first. A thousand buds, Perfumed with sweetness, ere the summer ends, Shall wither, fade, and fall—while these fair fictions Shall never die. Mar. [Smiling.] Because they never lived! A barren boast. I would not wear my heart Upon such dull conditions to secure A life of centuries! All that is bright Trembles in quick and sensitive vibration— All that is beautiful moves to a change. The varying seasons shadow in their course The sympathising earth—suns rise and set— Clouds skim the azure sky—the light of day Mellows to evening—evening into night— Night into ruddy dawn—dawn to new day. All life is ceaseless motion. To stand still Is but a term for death—the monument, And not the living man. Eug. Shall love change, too? Mar. Ay, like the moon, through every varying phase, And yet be bright and beautiful in all! Youth's heady passion—manhood's tenderness— Old age's silent cherishing. Eug. And then? Mar. Why then, like flowers, whose summer course is done, Their blossoms shed, their green leaves seared and fallen, For a short season it shall seem to die: Yet only seem,—bursting again to life Beneath a brighter, purer sky; and there, Amidst an endless spring, blooming for ever! Eug. Ere my love change, I first must change myself, For it and I are one. Mar. Wilt swear to that? Eug. Ay, by the prettiest oath e'er framed. Elm. Eugene! The man who traced that Friar to Lafont's, Did he perceive him quit the house again, Or mark which way he went? Eug. I did not ask, sir. Content to find him what I first believed, When I had tracked him home I sought no further. Elm. True: ay, as you say, home. Of course 'twas so. He came from thence. Mar. Now out upon this Friar— He has bewitched you! Ever on our talk, Since first you saw him, breaks this spectre Friar, And snaps the thread of it! I am beat back From household consultations—plans of pleasure— Matters of grave debate—all are pushed by For some new speculation on this Friar! Nay, even when, as now, I listen to The prettiest common-places love can utter, In comes your Friar again, and scatters all To the unpitying winds! Elm. Well, well: 'tis folly, I own it is. Yet the man haunts me strangely. Hast never seen a face you could be sworn You'd met before—yet know not when nor how? It might be in a dream, so vaguely floats The memory of it: yet, if such it were, It was a painful dream. A face that wakes More an impression than a recollection? Such is that Friar's face some. I felt it When first I met him.—Next I found him busy Tampering with the quiet of my house— And now I trace him to the doors of one Whom many circumstances tempt to be My active enemy.—At least 'tis strange! Enter a Servant, L. Ser. Monsieur Lafont, sir, waits below, and prays The favour of a private interview. Elm. [Starting up.] Lafont! Did I not say so!—I'll not see him. Mar. That message will sound rude. Elm. I will not see him! Say I am occupied—that there are hours And places for affairs of business: To-morrow he will find me. [Exit Servant, L. Eug. Sir, bethink you. Elm. [Impatiently.] I say I will not have my privacy Intruded on; and who shall chain me down In my own house? Mar. [Astonished.] Father! Enter Lafont, L. Laf. Ha! my dear Elmore! You have a foolish fellow for a servant; He said you would not see me! Mar. You are bold, sir, To come unbid. Laf. [Bowing.] Beauty makes cowards bold! Elm. [Interposing.] I think you said you had some business— Laf. Ay—private business—talked of best alone. Elm. Here's but my daughter and her destined husband: From them I have no secrets. Laf. [Whispering.] Are you sure? Quite sure of that?—Why do you start?—I offer A private hearing. Mar. Father, you are ill! You tremble—you look pale!—What is the matter? Elm. Nothing, child—nothing—but a passing faintness. Mar. Eugene—run—call for help! Elm. No!—I am well— Quite well. Mar. [To Lafont.] Sir, you perceive your coming here Is most inopportune. My father's strength Is tried, at times, too much. I pray you go— Eug. And quickly, or you'll tempt me, sir, to use A harsher language than befits your years. Elm. Peace, peace, Eugene! There's nothing—nothing wrong— We'll speak together. Margaret, there was something You had to do—go, do it. And, Eugene, That letter we conferred upon this morning— Attend to it. Mar. I cannot leave you thus! Elm. [Impatiently.] How thus? What mean you, silly girl? All's well. Go, go, you simpleton! You interrupt us. The sooner now we enter on our task, The sooner I am free, and yours again. There—go—go—go— Mar. He smiles—yet I can see He only decks his lips with a false mirth, That shows more sadly than an open sorrow. What can this mean? Eug. He grows impatient. Come, love! But keep within his call. [Exit, R., leading out Margaret, who continues to look back, anxiously watching her father. Elm. [After walking about irresolutely, flings himself into a chair.] Well, Sir? Laf. My friend Forgets his ordinary courtesy. [Elmore points to a chair, and turns his head away. Will you forgive me—I've a foolish habit That, when I talk, I like to see the faces Of those I talk with. Humour me so far! Elm. [After a struggle, turning and looking him in the face.] Well, sir! Laf. Ay, thank you.—There has been with me A holy Friar—I think you've seen him, too— He has been sent here from some distant convent To gather pious alms.—I own, myself, I'm little given to the company Of these good churchmen; but the talk of this one Has moved me much—'Twas of our dear Eugene— You don't attend to me. Elm. I do. Laf. It seems This Friar knew his father—Count De Lorme.— In Brittany—was it not strange? Elm. 'Tis likely Many in Brittany knew Count de Lorme. Laf. True—very true. But then this worthy Friar Told all his history with such minuteness! He knew Du Barré, too—and he repeated How they both loved one lady—but her friends Gave her De Lorme.—You really don't attend! Elm. I have told you, sir, I do. Laf. And then he added, How, after marriage, dear De Lorme grew jealous Of Count Du Barré's interest with his wife— 'Twas said not without cause. Elm. [Starting up.] 'Twas false as hell! And she as pure as angels fresh from heaven! Laf. You knew her then? Elm. [Checking himself.] I have heard her history: And manly sympathy may well protect The reputation of an injured woman— Still more, the sacred honour of her grave. Laf. Hm! That's so generous, so charitable! I love you for it so! I do, indeed. Ay, as you say, the poor young lady died In bearing our Eugene:—on which, Du Barré, Distracted, let us hope, by this new grief, Turned all his rage on the bereaved De Lorme. They met one night upon the river's bank— You need not stir:—well, as I said, they met; And there Du Barré stabbed him to the heart, And flung him in the stream to hide the murder. Elm. The blow was given in self-defence—repented As soon—that is, so I have heard the story. Laf. How very well you seem to be informed Of every particular! Elm. What then? The tale is common on a thousand lips— What wonder I have heard it, too? What wonder My version differs somewhat from your own? Laf. Hm! Oh, no wonder. Yet Du Barré fled; He might be innocent, though, notwithstanding— But most thought otherwise; and the law judged him, And sentenced him to meet a felon's death, If ever he were found—How pale you look! This moves you very much! Elm. [Gasping.] No—no—go on. Laf. You know, my dearest friend, how much I love you. For worlds I would not hurt you. Re-consider Your late decision! Give me leave again To plead my suit with lovely Margaret, And lend your voice to help me! Won't you, Elmore? Elm. [As before.] What's this to me, or Margaret? Laf. Hm! The Friar— How very strange he should have come to me, Who am so much your friend!—he says Du Barré Still lives, in spite of his reported loss— Lives here in France, under another name; That he has much to make life precious to him— Great wealth, and a young, lovely, helpless daughter. He says that now this murderer—this felon— This outlaw, with a price set on his head— This Count du Barré—is called—Matthew Elmore! [Elmore utters a loud cry, and falls senseless. Enter Margaret, hastily, R. Mar. What cry was that?—My father! [Rushes to him. Elm. [Reviving, and glancing fearfully around.] Is he gone? Ah! he's there still! Mar. [To Lafont.] Sir, can you not perceive, Whatever the ill tidings you have brought, Your presence makes them worse? Beseech you, go! Laf. When Margaret's here? Elm. [In a low voice.] Cling closer to me, child! So—closer still! Mar. Father! what does this mean? Elm. The sight of him is poison to my eyes— Send him away! Mar. I bade you, sir, be gone; You see this is no time to talk with him. Laf. Then I must talk with you, sweet Margaret. Mar. Neither with him nor me. Have you no feeling That you can look on such a man, so moved, And persecute him still? Laf. It grieves me much; Yet be not, sweet, so peremptory. Better Make me your friend—you had, indeed! Mar. [Proudly.] Do you threaten? Laf. Not willingly; I love too much to threaten. And yet you'd better think upon your answer, Ere you reject— Mar. [Impatiently.] You drive me from my nature! My answer! To your insolence, my loathing; To your professions, scorn; and to your threats, Defiance! Laf. And is this your answer? Mar. Aye. Laf. Hm! That's a pity; for your father's life Depended on it. Mar. What? my father's life! Laf. It rests with me! Mar. My father's life with thee! Thou bold blasphemer! Would'st thou dare assert, The Power who guards the virtuous and just, Would give a life like his into the hand Of such a wretch as thou? Father! speak, father! Fling the vile falsehood back into his teeth, And say how much you scorn him! Laf. He is silent! Perhaps he does not hear you. Let me speak: Elmore! My valued, honest, virtuous friend! This gentle maiden disbelieves my words— Shall I refer her to the Count du— Elm. [Shrieking, and flinging himself at Lafont's feet.] Ha! Spare me—oh, spare me! My pure, innocent child— She'll hate me! Spare me! look, I'm kneeling! Mar. [Indignantly snatching him away.] Father! Or this is madness, or 'tis something worse. I dare not look on it. Doubts, spite of faith, Battle for entrance. [Seeing Lafont.] Ha! art thou there still? I'm glad of it! I will speak with thee, now— But yet, not before him—nor in this place. Enter Eugene, R. Eug. What stir is this? Mar. I know not: Some heavy grief has crushed my father's soul. And paralyzed his sense. Eugene, stay with him, But do not heed his words! His fancy wanders. Eugene, look that thou do not wrong my father With an unworthy thought! He is unhappy, But nothing more! I will return again, When I have spoke a word with yonder man. Watch till I come. Oh, father! [Throws her arms round Elmore's neck—then tears herself away.] Now [To Lafont.] I'm ready! Laf. Can you forgive me? Mar. [Impatiently.] All things but delay! [Exit, L. followed by Lafont. Elm. [Feebly.] Margaret! Where is she? Gone! Oh, not with him! He must not speak with her. Margaret! my child! Margaret! [Attempts to follow her, but reels into a chair.] Oh, lost, lost!—betrayed! abandoned! Eug. [Kneeling by his side, and affectionately taking his hand.] No, not abandoned, my best friend! [Elmore gazes steadfastly on him.] My father! [Elmore snatches his hand away, and buries his face.— Curtain falls. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —A Room in Elmore's House. Margaret discovered on a sofa, R. her face covered with her hands—Lafont standing beside her. Laf. Don't take it so to heart! Your tears distress me; They grieve me very much—they do, indeed! It's true your father murdered—that is, slew— The gentleman; for, after all, in fairness, Perhaps it should not be called murder—may be, A duel, without witnesses— Mar. [Looking up.] It might! Lafont, at least I thank thee for that hope. Hope! Oh, that I must seek my hope in that, Which is but guilt a little less uncommon! Laf. And yet one would be glad to think it so. It's always pleasant to believe the best, When our friends err. It's true that the stern law— (But then, we know, the law is stern, and cannot Feel as we feel, who love the criminal)— The law decreed it murder, and condemned him To death! Mar. He was judged unheard! How knew they What provocation drove him to the deed— What wrong received purged it of half its guilt! Oh, had they heard him, what now seems offence, Necessitated by the strong occasion, Might then have shown like virtue. Laf. So it might— Yes, certainly, it might. It was a pity, A thousand pities, that he fled. You know That really looked so very much like guilt— It did indeed—you must admit it did. [Margaret ouries her face in despair. He might have else even escaped suspicion, For no one saw the deed itself. 'Twas known That he and the slain man were enemies, And that they met that night—but nothing more. The morning found, its true, where they had been— Signs of a struggle on the river's bank, And marks of blood—yet thieves might have done that: But then, you see, your father took to flight— Was met, unluckily, with clothes all stained, And eyes wild staring with remorse and horror. They tracked him to the coast, where he took ship For England:—really, now, this hardly looked Like innocence! Mar. [Who has been writhing with agony, starts up.] Who was the murdered man? Lives there a wife and children, whose deep wrong Cries for revenge—whose pardon may be bought With such weak recompence as gold can offer For such a loss? They shall have all we own. From hence I'll live on crusts—I'll be their servant, Their drudge, their slave—an humble, willing slave— So they but spare my father! Tell me all! Laf. Poor lady! Mar. Hold, sir! No compassion! No— Not your compassion! I can suffer much— Can meet your sarcasms or your sneering smiles, Endure your hate, your malice, your revenge, But not your pity—oh, no, not your pity! Laf. Scorn me not, sweet! I meant to speak of hope— Mar. [Eagerly.] Of what?—of innocence? Laf. In the world's eye. Can you be calm and listen? Mar. [Bitterly.] Oh, yes, calm. Laf. The Matthew Elmore, by another name, Is the proscribed assassin sought so long, Is yet a secret known but to myself And one beside, whose tongue I can control. Do you not see a path of safety now? I love you, beauteous Margaret— Mar. [Starting.] Ha! stay! [Then, with trembling eagerness. Yes, yes, I listen— Laf. Make his interest mine— The father of my wife would have a claim On all my care. Mar. [As before.] Go on. Laf. His fortune, too, Should swell, not suffer, by our compact— Mar. Aye— Laf. For he and I, instead of rivals, then Should share our knowledge and our well-planned ventures, With double 'vantage—profits without bound— And all to be my Margaret's at last! Mar. I think I understand—yet I am dull— Let me be quite assured. My father's guilt, then, As yet is unsuspected, save by you And one beside, whose tutored tongue, you say, Speaks or keeps silence as you may direct? Laf. Exactly so; but don't say tutored tongue. Mar. And I am made your confident, in hope I may be wrought, by terror and affection, To give the hand you seek for as the price At which your silence must be bought? [Lafont bows respectfully. Thou knave! [With sudden energy. Thou shallow, self-convicted knave! Caught, caught In thine own trap! Thou hast confessed it all— The means, the end, the motive—laid all bare! Oh, thou poor knave!—and that convenient friend, Who swears or unswears, speaks or holds his peace At thy command—you have conspired together!— Ransacked the annals of forgotten crime, And, having found one fitted to your purpose, Plotted to charge it on my father's head, To gain his envied wealth! Oh, brave device, So cunningly to play upon the fears Of a weak girl! That weak girl sees thee through— Sees through thy most transparent artifice, And laughs at thy detected plot! Dare now To breathe one word against my father's honour, I'll hold thee up to public shame—the world, The blinded world, shall see thee as thou art! Laf. Hm! You presume upon my love. Mar. Thy love! Do not profane that holy word so far— Find out some other name for the rank compound That festers in thy hollow heart. Thy love! Oh, matchless insolence! If I believed I owned a quality so base and vile, That thou couldst love it, I would pluck it out From my corrupted heart, though it should tear My life along with it! Laf. Hm! that's so bitter! Mar. Now, sir, you have your answer—get you gone, While you may go in safety, ere I call My father, and lay bare your villany. His indignation might be ill to meet, Unless, indeed, illimitable scorn Of the gross charge—too great for common anger— Should only find its vent in mirth. Laf. That's likely: He was exceeding merry when we left him! [Margaret starts and shrinks back. You had forgotten that! Mar. [Almost inarticulately.] I had—I had! Laf. He could not keep his feet for mirth! He knelt, Grovelled and knelt!—this noble, virtuous Elmore, Grovelled and knelt to the despised Lafont! Mar. [As before.] He did, he did! [Impetuously.] Tell me, what does this mean? Hast thou spoke truth? Man—tell me, did my father, By any devilish tempting, in some moment Of frenzy—madness—did he do that thing Which thou hast said? Laf. We'll go and ask him. Mar. [Shrieks.] No! [Then, faltering. I dare not. Oh, if thou hast any pity, Say thou hast played upon me—frightened me— I'll not be angry—I'll forgive thee; nay, I'll bless thee—pray for thee! I'll— Laf. [Softly.] Marry me? Mar. [In despair.] Oh, no, no, no! Laf. Not while Eugene de Lorme Remains, to tempt you with a younger blood. It's very natural—but still a pity, Considering the bar between you. Hm! You asked the name of him your father slew: Your father at that time was called Du Barré, And he he murdered was the Count de Lorme, The father of Eugene— [Margaret stands a moment stupified—then pressing her hand to her brow, appears falling—Lafont approaches to support her—but at his touch she starts and with a shudder waves him away—then sinks into a chair and sits motionless. Mar. [Bewildered.] It is too much! Yet, if it's true, then life is all a lie, Of double-steeped hypocrisy!—All's dark— All lost in tangled chaos. Out, out on it! Hurry it to an end! Laf. [Gently.] Margaret— Mar. [Rising.] Sir— Laf. Do you listen? Mar. Sir? Oh, yes— Laf. Come, be persuaded— Mar. Yes—what you will; it does not matter now. Laf. Your father— Mar. Ay—my father— Laf. Let us seek him. Mar. True, I remember—yes, I'll go—I'll go— But first alone; you must not come just yet; Come in an hour—but, let me see him first. Laf. If you desire it. Mar. I am grateful, sir. [Going, R. Laf. Permit me— [Offering his hand. Mar. Thank you, I can walk. [Totters out, R. Laf. [Looking after her.] Poor thing! She makes me pity her—she does, indeed! [Seats himself, as if to watch—Scene closes. SCENE II. —Gardens of the Tuilleries. Enter Jenny, R. and Manou, L. meeting. Jenny. Oh, Madame Manou! I'm ravished, as you say, in France, to meet you! I am in such dreadful want of a confidant! Man. Why, what's the matter, child? Jenny. That's exactly what I want to know! There's your master has been with my master, and they were shut up together; when presently there was such a disturbance and screaming and crying, and Miss Margaret in tears, and such a to-do altogether, as you never heard in all your life! Man. But what about? Jenny. Don't I tell you, that's what I can't discover— which makes it so particularly dreadful! I'm sure, as soon as ever I learned that there was something the matter, I ran to the key-hole— Man. Stop! that was beneath you, Jenny—undignified— Jenny. Oh, I suppose you never do such a thing! Man. [With dignity.] Never! When I want information, I cross-question and pump for it: that's intellectual and lady-like. However, since you have done it, go on and tell me. Jenny. La! have not I told you I've got nothing to tell? What I want is, to find it out! Why, as soon as ever I got to the door, out Miss Margaret came, and your master with her, and they went into another room where the nasty door fastens with a bolt, and has no key-hole at all! I could have cried. I hate that door, and have tried to get it altered a hundred times! Man. Poor child! I pity you, from my soul! But hush! [Looking round.] There's old Jean Rusé close at our heels, and St. Lo is with him. Now, if all this has any thing to do with master, Jean is sure to know it, and St. Lo can worm any thing out of him that he pleases. Jenny. Do you think so? Then I'll make a confidant of him directly! Man. Capital, my dear! Always make a confidant of any body you want to get a secret out of! Enter St. Lo and Jean Ruse, C. Jean. Go to, go to! you're a sad dog. I've never Been sober for an hour since I knew you— St. Lo. Never been sad, you mean! Jean. It's all the same. St. Lo. You've been a prince! Jean. I have! St. Lo. A hero! Jean. Ay! St. Lo. A demi-god! Jean. I have! St. Lo. You have looked down With scorn upon the pens and ink of earth— Jean. I have! I have! I don't mean to complain— I like it!—Ha! Manou, the beautiful! Manou, the glorious! Manou, the rich! [Jenny touches St. Lo's arm, and leads him up, R., where she remains whispering with him. Man. Jean the gallant! Jean. That boy's a funny boy! We've done no business since he's been here— Nothing but fun! Man. What brings you to this place? Jean. Hm! I forgot. That's business, to be sure. I'm sent to look for an exempt or two. Man. The officers of justice! Mercy on us! For what? Jean. I can't imagine. To my mind, It's very foolish waking Justice up— We'd better let her sleep. For my own part, I tremble at the sight of an exempt! Man. [Whispers him.] No wonder, Jean—no wonder— St. Lo. [To Jenny.] Home, good girl, And I'll work wonders for you—if I can. Jenny. Thank you, I'm sure, sir! And really my place depends upon it—for I never did, and never will, stay in a house where there is a secret I can't find out! [Exit, L. St. Lo. [Advancing thoughtfully.] Trouble at Elmore's—bustle at Lafont's— And officers of justice sent for! Strange! And quite a pity I can't understand it! Well! I was never good at reading riddles— But if a plot is playing, I'll cut in And take a hand! I must obtain that key; And the old scoundrel is so shrewd, Manou Makes nothing of him. This might help me.—So! I have it all! [Whispers.] Manou, get the rogue home, And keep him there an hour or two. It's bold— But what of that? I like it all the better! Man. Jean, I am going home; lend me your arm. [Takes it. Jean. [Hesitating.] But master's business— St. Lo. I'll do it for you. Jean. Now will you, though? What, go for the exempts? I'd take it as a favour, certainly. St. Lo. Shall brother Jean ask me for any favour, And I deny it? Jean. What a funny boy! Man. But, Jean, you must look smart. Hold up your head! St. Lo. [Aside, while Manou busies Jean with arranging his dress.] I'll find him officers, or make him some! Du Viray and Morluc are masqueraders That few can match. I'll dress them as exempts— I think 'twill do!—and even should it fail, There'll be some sport at least! Jean. [Dragging back from Manou.] They are to come Quite privately, and wait till master calls them. St. Lo. I recollect it. Farewell, brother Jean! Speed to your wooing—joy to your young love! [Exit, C. F. Jean. [Looking after him.] It is a funny boy, then! Man. Ah, but, Jean, if you did really love me, you'd not leny me one little half-hour's rummage in that closet. Jean. [Chuckling.] Pretty Manou, ask nothing before marriage that ought not to be granted till after it.—I don't! [Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi! No, no. We must be virtuous, Manou, and prudent! [Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi! [Aside.] Oh, I'm her match! Man. [Aside.] Ugh! you old oaf! Jean. Yes—prudent!—[Laughing.] Hi! hi! hi! [Exeunt, L. S. E. SCENE III. —A Room in Elmore's House. Elmore discovered, seated. Elm. Discovered—ruined—lost! Am I the same Who stood an hour ago this house's master?— The proud, the wealthy, courted, honoured Elmore? Oh, lie—oh, gilded lie—now stripped so bare! [Starts up. What madness tempted my return to France? It was that burning fever of the heart, That elsewhere found no rest:—it was the cries, Haunting my ear, of those whom I had orphaned, Calling me here to fill their father's place! And now, in stretching forth my hand to them, I have outstretched and lost myself. Oh, thus That over-ruling Justice, which directs The issues of our lives, stands by the culprit, And, when his blinding guilt has sealed his eyes, Guides him, unknowing, to the very spot Fixed for his execution. [Starts.] Hark! a footstep— My child's! How shall I meet her? Enter Margaret, slowly, R. Margaret! Mar. [Faintly, and keeping at a distance.] Sir— Elm. [Hesitating, and then advancing a step towards her.] Margaret— Mar. [Shrinking back, mutters.] A murderer—a sentenced murderer! Those hands, which have so often fondled mine— Those fingers, which have played among my hair, And smoothed it on my brow so many a time— Blood has been on them—human blood! Elm. [Faltering.] My child— It is not thus we have been used to meet— Mar. [As before.] That's still his voice—the same, whose gentle tone So often lulled my pettish infancy— Which, till an hour ago, could never sound, But it seemed music—now how harsh it jars! Elm. [Extending his hand.] Margaret!—Do you shrink from me, my child? [She slowly and fearfully advances towards him, and with an evident struggle places her hand in his. She shudders at my touch! That's past belief— I could bear all but that. Girl, they have told thee— Mar. All. Elm. No—not all! They may have told, perhaps, How one I hated wedded one I loved, But none could ever tell thee how I loved her— The wild, the maddening passion—let it pass! Perhaps she answered to it:—he, at least, Who won her, thought so—till his jealous doubts Reproached her innocence. She bore him children— But, swayed by the gross frenzy of his thought, He loathed the sight of them and called them bastards! Oh, then, her outraged honour, no less proud Than it was pure, broke her young heart.—She died! Mar. Oh, happy!—Yet go on. Elm. It was the night Fixed for her burial—and I sat alone: I was not mad, for I had consciousness, And knew my desolation. The deep toll Of the loud convent bell, with measured stroke, Fell on my ear, till its repeated sound Gnawed, like a living thing, upon my brain. And then there came the flat and heavy tread Of those who bore her—they must pass my house; Convulsed, I started up and fled!—Close by, Sullen and black—tempting to thoughts as dark— The plashing river lay. I neared its bank— Perhaps with sinful purpose—ay, thou tremblest— But sinful thoughts, indulged, bring sinful acts Before unthought of. In my very path, In that wild hour, he crossed me—he himself Who had consigned her to her early tomb. We spoke—but what, I know not; yet I know I taunted—spurned him—charged him with her blood. He challenged me and drew. I was unarmed, But with one hand I struck aside his sword, And with the other felled him to the ground, And so passed on.—Burning with rage, he followed— I heard his voice and his quick nearing tread— I turned, and saw the gleaming of his sword Close at my throat.—Desperate, I sprang upon him, Grappled, and wrenched the weapon from his grasp, And drove it in his heart! Why, girl, dost stand Looking upon me with that stony gaze? Dost thou condemn me still?—Speak!—Tell me, child, Could it have happened otherwise? Mar. [Faintly.] Go on. Elm. [Sinking.] Oh, that it had!—for when the blow was struck, When his loud death-shriek rang upon my brain, And his pierced corpse fell heavy at my feet, Oh, then indeed all changed!—The murky air Grew thick and choking—lightnings flashed before me— A thousand thunders bellowed in my ear, And every one cried, “Murderer!”—I fled, And knew not whither, till I found myself In a strange land, with strangers gathered round me: And there was one who watched and pitied me, Pouring the balm of woman's tenderness Upon my bruised spirit, till I grew To love her—not as I had loved before, But with the quiet of a calm affection That leaned upon her soothing gentleness, As on a place of rest from my 'scaped shipwreck: She was thy mother, child— Mar. [Sighing.] Go on, go on. Elm. But blood was spilt, and the avenger's wing Hovered above my house. It was on her That the blow fell: she drooped, and she, too, died; But still her memory remained in thee. Oh, how I prayed to have thee spared to me! How watched, how toiled for thee! My prayer was heard! Granted!—for what—for what? My child was spared, That I might see her, now, shrink from my sight, And shudder at my touch! Mar. [Flinging her arms round his neck, and bursting into tears.] Father!—My father! [Then breaking away from him, she continues hurriedly. We'll speak no more of this—we will forget it— All shall be well—fear not—all shall be well— And yet one question first—Is there no hope The sentence may be yet reversed? Elm. None—none— I have no witnesses. Mar. And one word more— It was, indeed, the father of Eugene— He—he—you— Elm. He I slew. Alas, poor child! It was. Mar. Enough!—We'll talk of it no more— 'Tis past: we'll never name Eugene again— All shall be well!— Elm. [Suddenly.] Margaret, I know thy thought! But sooner shall they tear me limb from limb— Mar. Hush—hush! You shall be safe. Elm. Never, child—never, By such a sacrifice! Mar. A sacrifice! Sir, you have yet to learn a woman's heart! She looks, perhaps, a weak, vain, fluttering thing; But call on her affections, she is strong, Constant, invincible, immovable; And sacrifice—a word without a meaning! See—I can smile already! Enter Lafont, L. Laf. My sweet friends, I fear I interrupt you. Mar. [Trembling.] No, sir, no— We waited for you. This agreement, sir, Of which we spoke—I am prepared. Elm. [Passionately.] Forbear! Child, I forbid it! Laf. Dearest Elmore—think! Your goods are confiscated by the law— Your life is forfeit.—Where shall Margaret shelter When these are taken? [Elmore covers his face. Mar. [In a low, hurried voice.] I have said I am ready. Laf. Then, sweetest, give me now your hand, in pledge Of a more formal contract soon to follow. But, mark! this act shall bear in it a vow As strong as any that the altar hears, And as irrevocable. Thus I take it. [Margaret slowly and tremblingly extends her hand; but, as she is on the point of placing it in Lafont's, overcome by emotion, faints. Elm. [Catching her.] Villain! what hast thou done?—Thou hast killed my child! Away! or I shall have another murder Upon my soul! There's something desperate in me. My blighted blossom! 'tis thy father's arms That circle thee.—Look up!—She cannot live While thou art near her.—Get thee gone, I say, Thou tempting, torturing fiend! Laf. Elmore, bethink you! Elm. [Bending over her.] Margaret—my pure one! Laf. I wait my answer— Elm. Devil—my defiance! Go—do thy worst! Laf. Since you desire it—well! Without there! Guard the doors!—If any pass, Your lives shall answer for it to the law! [Exit, L.—Elmore presses his lips to Margaret's cheek.—The curtain falls. END OF ACT IV.</field>

St. Lo leaning near them, and Jean Ruse uneasily walking up and down. Mor. More wine, there, wench! More wine! Enter Manou, with wine, L. St. Lo. [Whispering.] Bravo, Morluc! Nature intended you a thieftaker, You look the part so well!— Du V. And I, St. Lo? St. Lo. Du Viray, you look just as great a scoundrel! Jean. What a most horrid world! Think of exempts Posting themselves here, in our private office, Where they're like matches in a magazine! Gentlemen, gentlemen! Your orders were To go to Elmore's—not to sit down here. Mor. [Starting up.] How!—Dog! cur! hound! knave! minion! scrub! Wilt thou teach gentlemen of law their duty? Du V. Good fellow, we have found some graver matter, As thou wilt quickly learn. Jean. [Aside.] There!—there!—I knew it! I said he must be mad, to send for them! Oh, what I'd give to be an honest man Just for five minutes, till I'd kicked them out! St. Lo. [Whispers,] Oh, brother Jean—I'm very sorry for you! Jean. [Alarmed.] Why?—What? Man. [Whispers.] They mean that key, Jean. Jean. Wh? what key? I've got no key!—I never said I had one. Man. No key!—Deny the key? Jean. [Impatiently.] All lies—all lies! Man. And my twelve hundred crowns, Jean! Jean. All lies, too! I don't believe you ever had as much. You've played upon me—made a fool of me— You and St. Lo there. Yes—I see it all— But now I wash my hands of you—I leave you. [Aside.] Master may look to this himself! [Going, L. Mor. Stay, prisoner! Jean. [Trembling.] Prisoner! Mor. It has been reported to us That certain evil practices have passed Within this house— Jean. [Agitated.] I'll call my master. [Going, L. Mor. [In a loud voice.] Stay! Du V. And, prisoner, 'tis said the secret proofs Are placed in yonder closet, to which you, Feloniously, have made a second key. Jean. [In agony.] No, no—I have not!—It's all false! —That woman— Man. Sweet gentlemen, indeed he only found it, And put it in that left-hand pocket. Du V. [Snatching it out.] Ha! What's this, thou villain? Jean. [Trembling.] That? St. Lo. That's not a key, No more than he's a man!—Can't you perceive It's but a skeleton! Mor. A skeleton key! Jean. It's nothing but the key of my own trunk. Du V. [Advancing to the closet, L. F.] I'll try it here. Jean. [Screaming.] No!—Pray, sir—pray, sir, don't! It's possible—just by the merest chance— That—by an accident—the key might fit— And then you'd ruin me! St. Lo. [Aside to Jean.] Oh brother Jean, I fear you're very likely to be ruined! They want your master's papers. Jean. [Eagerly.] Is that all? Break down the door then! I'll make no resistance. It will be all the same, you know, to you; I'll even run and fetch a crow-bar for you, But not my key! Sweet, gentle gentlemen, I'm a poor man, but I have fifty crowns, The savings of some five-and-thirty years— I'll give you all to spare me! What will become of me! [Clasping his hands. Man. [Aside to Jean.] Fly for your life! Jean. I will—I will!— Oh what a wicked—what a horrid world! Exit, L.—Du Viray and Morluc open the closet, and pull out papers. Man. Quick, quick! I tremble lest my master come! [Exit, following Jean, L. St. Lo. Find what relates to Herminie. Mor. Here! Du V. Here! [They draw out papers, examine and hand some to St. Lo, the rest are scattered about the floor.— Scene closes. SCENE II. —A Gallery in Elmore's House. Enter Margaret, C. F., looking fearfully behind her. Mar. I had nearly ruined all—I must repair it. To flight! To flight from him I love the best To him I loathe the deepest—and alone— Before my father can suspect my purpose. He'll stay me else—and then he's lost! [Going, L., starts and stops. Eugene! Oh cruel accident! [Endeavouring to retire. Enter Eugene, L. Eug. Margaret, I sought you. Mar. [Hurriedly.] Not now—another time—to-morrow— Eug. Now! For every moment is an age of torture. Is this your writing? [Shows a letter. Mar. [Faintly, and averting her head.] Yes. Eug. You answer me Without examination. Mar. [As before.] It is mine. Eug. Own not so lightly to the cruel lines— You do not know their purport. They would tell me That you disclaim the vows so lately made,— Call back the love bestowed but yesterday,— And bid me part from you for ever. Mar. Yes—'twas thus I wrote. Eug. Thou didst!—What have I done? Wherein deserved this?—What has been my offence? Mar. Nothing. Eug. I'll swear it!—I have asked the heart That hung upon thee with such doting love,— The zeal that followed, worshipping thy steps,— The faith that stored its all of happiness Under thy keeping—I have asked them all, And all declare me guiltless. Mar. [Aside.] I must go— I dare not listen, or I shall betray— Eug. Oh hadst thou died—I would have wept thee then With tears that, amber-like, should have embalmed Thy memory, till they and it were one. But thus to lose thee!—thus to find thee false To vows—to oaths— Mar. Oh no! not false, Eugene! Eug. Not false!—what art thou then? Mar. Wretched—most wretched! [Then suddenly. Ask me no more—Eugene, be generous! Think me unhappy, but not criminal. Oh do not curse me!—Were you struggling thus— Did you so pray to me for kind construction— Were these tears yours, and yours this bursting heart, My faith should battle with appearances: I would disown my sense—deny my reason— Ay, would believe impossibilities, Rather than risk to wrong you with a thought! Eug. And yet in deeds how cruelly you wrong me! If I have sinned against you, let me be Confronted with my offence. The meanest culprit May claim so much!—Oh! tongue-tied!—Canst thou and Not even one extenuating plea That may relieve the blackness of thy falsehood, And bid me not to curse thee! Mar. [In agony.] Stay, Eugene! Spare me—be merciful! Eug. Fie!—fie upon This poor hypocricy of seeming grief! Mar. Eugene—oh is he not my— [Checks herself. Eug. What?—Is who? Whom dost thou speak of? Mar. [Shrinking.] Nothing—nothing—no one. [Aside.] I dare not stay to bear this torture longer! Farewell, Eugene. Let us not part in anger. I might reproach you with some cruelty, But I forgive you. We are both unhappy, And need not sharpen one another's pangs. Eug. Art thou not false? Mar. If thou wilt mourn me less Thinking me so—as it is like thou wilt— Then call me false, and drive me from thy heart: I'll not complain, if thou art saved a tear. Oh, I am as a wretch already reeling Within the eddy of a whirlpool's sweep, Beyond the reach alike of love and hate,— Powerless,—helpless!—every passing moment The narrowing circles drag me closer in To the dark gulf where I must sink for ever. Eug. Margaret, there is some horrid mystery Which thou would'st hide— Mar. [Agitated.] No—no— Eug. But he, who first Encouraged my young love to soar, shall be My counsel now in my despair. Elmore shall— Mar. [Shrieking, and grasping his arm.] Not for thy life, Eugene!—Go not to him— Not to my father! Eug. Margaret, what can mean This wild destraction? Mar. A distracted heart!— Have pity on it, then!—Oh if I ever Possessed thy love—if ever, to thine eyes, The tears in mine appeared a sacred thing,— As thou hast said they did—scorn them not now! Promise me—swear thou wilt not seek my father! I ask but a few hours—but till to-morrow— Oh do not hesisate!—I'll kneel to thee— Eug. Margaret, what thou wilt. Mar. But thou wilt swear? Eug. I promise. Mar. Bless thee!—Now we'll talk no more— Forget that I have ever been. Efface me As a dark blot that for a moment marred Thy brighter page. And so—[Gazes affectionately on him.] Eugene—[Takes his hand in hers, and slowly carries it to her lips.] Farewell! [Hurries out, R. Eug. I will not lose her thus!—I'll follow her— Enter a Servant, L., presenting a letter. Away! [Waving him off. Ser. It came in haste, sir, from Lafont's. Eug. Lafont's! [Tears it open.] What's here!— [Reading.] The Friar Dominic, Who said he was a friend of Count De Lorme, Now summons both his children to Lafont's. Be instant!—So I will! This sudden call Meets my suspicions half way on the road. I'll pierce this mystery, though its deep secret Lay buried in the centre! To Lafont's! [Exit. L. SCENE III. —A Room in Lafont's House.—Writing materials and papers on a table, C. Friar Dominic and Lafont discovered, seated. Laf. Yes, she will come. I have her letter here. And when all's done, depend on't, holy Father, For your assistance in this pious work, I will enrich your convent to your wish. Friar. I am content. Yet tell me why the hate You bear to Elmore, shapes itself to love Thus to pursue his daughter? Laf. Saintly father, Your appetites are mortified—and yet, In your vocation, you have heard, perhaps, Of carnal passion? She is beautiful. You pardon injuries—but common men Nurse a deep-hoarded treasure called revenge. She is the one child of my enemy. Your vows are poverty—but we poor laymen Find some delight in riches. She is rich. You see, at once, I've beauty for my toying, My enemy's best jewel for my prize, And gold to pay me for enjoying it! Ha! ha!—Is there not reason in my love? Friar. True. I will make no further waste of breath In seeking to dissuade you. Laf. Learned Father, I could expect no other from your wisdom! Friar. A footstep!—Hark! [Rises. Laf. My Margaret herself! [Rises, and advances to meet her. Enter Margaret, L. Sweet lady! This is kind to come to me. I might show more gallant waiting on you, But we are safer here from interruption. You will forgive me?—In this holy man You see the priest who shall unite our hands. Mar. [Murmurs.] The executioner.—Well, what's to do, sir? Friar. [Pointing to the table.] The contract, there prepared, must first be signed. But wherefore, maiden, are you come alone? The meanest peasant, in an hour like this, Brings troops of smiling friends to grace her nuptials. Have you no kin?—no brother?—father? Mar. [Passionately.] Man— I charge thee, by a breaking heart's deep grief, Do not insult my wretchedness! To you— To you I owe this lonely desolation. 'Twas you who raised this storm where we are wrecked. Friar. Thy father's guilt, my child— Mar. My father's guilt! What was a moment's unforethought offence To the calm baseness of a plot like this! My father's guilt!—Oh blush to use the word, Thou trebly guilty priest! Thou know'st my lips Dare make no cry to man for my redress, But before listening angels I denounce thee As leagued in craft with yonder heartless wretch— A shame to thy great office! Friar. Daughter—peace! Mar. I will not peace!—for peace and I are now Parted for ever. No—I will not peace! And, when this poor turmoil of life shall end, As soon it will for me—nor late for thee— Then—when we meet before another bar— Still, still I will no peace—but charge on thee Crushed hearts—a ruined home—a soul perhaps Lost by despair—till thou shalt agonize And writhe as I do now! Laf. Sweet Margaret, There will be time enough for this hereafter. The holy man and contract both are waiting. [Leads her to the table. Mar. [Hesitating.] Yet, tell me, is there no alternative? Will all our wealth— Laf. Naught but thy lovely self: I would not do such shame to your rare value, To barter it for gold! Your father, too— Mar. Father—ay, there's the word! Father! Where is it? Give me the paper— [Snatches a pen. Friar. Stay awhile, my child— Formalities like this are of great weight, And must have further witnessing. Without, there! Enter Servant, L. Are those I sent for come? Ser. They are. Friar. Admit them. [Exit Servant, L. Enter Eugene and Herminie, L. Mar. Eugene! Laf. [Angrily.] What's this? Friar. To make your triumph full. [To Eugene.] Well, boy! we meet again—I said we should. And this should be your sister? [Regarding Herminie earnestly.] She is fair— Her. Then more unfitted for so foul a place, And doubly foul a deed! We have learned your purpose. Eug. Yet, Margaret, tell me, 'tis not with your will That I am summoned here to undergo Insult on outrage added! Ha! you weep! Is this, which seems consent, extorted from you? Margaret! confide in me! My sword—my life— Shall guard thee yet! Do they constrain thee? Speak! Friar. Speak, maiden!—Shall your promise be retracted? Mar. [Looks timidly to Lafont—then shrinking back.] No—do not torture me, Eugene!—This act Is of my free, deliberate will. Her. [Indignantly.] 'Tis false! Thy will was ever holy, pure, and honest— Laf. The contract waits—we really lose our time. Mar. [Suddenly.] Quick!—Give it to me!—Quick! [Goes to the table. Elmore. [Without.] I know she's here! Mar. [Looking round wildly.] My father's voice! Elmore. [Without.] Away! I tell you, knaves, I'd reach my child through twenty thousand such! Enter Elmore, L. Where is she?—Is it done?—My Margaret! Why dost thou hide thy face upon my breast? Am I too late?—Speak, some one! Is it done? Friar. Nothing is done that with a breath as light May not be yet undone again. Laf. We waited For our dear father. Hm! [Apart.] Elmore, be wise! Elm. I will be wise! Thy power only lives In my concealed offence—and with a breath I rob thee of it—thus! Without there! Ho! You officers of justice! Mar. [Breaking from him.] Ha! Elm. This way! Mar. One moment! [Springs to the table, and writes. Elm. [Stamping.] Hither! Mar. [Handing to Lafont the contract, and throwing herself into Elmore's arms.] Father, it is done! You're now too late! Enter Morluc, Du Viray, and others, as exempts, L. Elm. [Pressing her to his heart.] My poor, devoted girl! But 'tis all vain—the spell is broken now. He did but seek thy wealth—he will not wed A felon's child! Eug., &amp; Her. A felon's! Elm. Ay, Eugene— Ay, Herminie! To you, the worst of felons! Mar. Oh, do not heed him! Elm. Yes, heed to me, all? Mar. He's mad! Elm. A sentenced felon! Mar. Father! Elm. Yes— The long proscribed Du Barré—the assassin Of Count de Lorme! Mar. Oh, no, no! Elm. I am he! [Margaret sinks on a seat. Eug. My father's murderer! Her. Elmore? Oh, no! Elm. [To Margaret.] And now, poor child, thou'rt beggared with that word, And thou must seek thy future sustenance Where the young ravens do—from heaven's garners. But thou art rescued from his foul pollution. Laf. But not from my revenge! That's left me still. Officers, seize your prisoner! Elm. I am ready— Yet first one word. My Herminie—Eugene— Do not shrink from me! I have wronged you deeply, But I have loved you, too; and in that love, Seeking to make atonement for that wrong, I ventured here, and thus have lost myself. I would not boast, as asking thanks; and yet Something I would ask:—my poor, helpless child— Let her not want! Mar. [Clinging to him.] Father, I'll die with thee! Elm. She has been guiltless! Eug. [While Herminie presses Margaret's hand.] Would my life itself Could be the sacrifice to win her peace! Laf. [Impatiently.] Your prisoner, sirs! Elm. I go— Friar. [To Lafont.] And yet, my son, Ere pressing forward to a public sentence, Lacks there not yet some proof? Laf. Of what? Friar. The death Of Count de Lorme. His body was not found. Laf. The law was satisfied. I don't pretend To be more hard of credence than the law. Eug. [To the Friar.] What would'st thou say? Her. Oh, speak! Can any doubt Be found to build a hope on? Friar. Hear and judge. Upon the night when it was thought he died, Two monks of a small solitary convent That stood upon the river's further bank, Hearing a cry, ferried across the stream, And found a bleeding man— Laf. [Starting.] A trick! a trick! Thou wouldst turn traitor, monk! Thou'rt bought! Eug. Peace, villain! Enter St. Lo, softly, behind. Friar. They staunched his wound and bore him to their house. Her. But did he live? Friar. He did. His name unknown, he joined their brotherhood, Forswore the world, and in his deep concealment Laughed with malicious glee to see his foe Denounced his murderer. Her. Yet he had children? Friar. He had—but bitter thoughts were in his soul, That elsewhere fathered them—and he denied them. Eug. Beware! Oh, do not tempt my mother's child To curse my father's memory! Friar. His fault Bore its stern punishment along with it: Unloving and unloved, he lingered on, A miserable man. But years at length Shed freshening dews upon him. First he wept For that pure angel he had wronged so foully; And then his children's images rose up, Like a soft dream;—and still the longing grew, Until he pined to see them. He had learned, A knave—a subtle knave—his servant once— Had seized their wealth. He hastened then to Paris— Her. To Paris! Eug. Here! Friar. And found his ancient foe Was now his child's protector. For a moment, His former jealousy revived—he judged The two confederate together, plotting To hold the boy a passive tool between them,— And he resolved to pierce their secret plans— For he had seen and loved his child— Eug. Who art thou? Speak! speak! Her. Thy name! thy name! Friar. [To Elmore.] Wilt thou, like them, Require my name? Elm. [Who has been listening with breathless eagerness.] The features all are changed— But the voice grows familiar on my ear; Oh, do not mock me, if I dare to call thee— Friar. De Lorme! [Eugene and Herminie spring to him. Mar. [Shrieks.] De Lorme! Alive! [Sinks on her knees.] My own, own father! Laf. [Aside.] What devil's here, dragging the dead to life, To overthrow me?—Yet the contract's safe! I have them there! Ha! ha! Her name is to it— It only wants my own. Soft! soft! [Moves stealthily to the table, spreads the paper on it, and is about to write, when St. Lo lays another paper over it. St. Lo. [Mocking him.] Soft! soft! Laf. [Starting back.] Ha! I am robbed! My private papers! St. Lo. Ay, Some half a score or so! [To Friar.] Look, holy father! Most dear, revivified, and welcome father— For so I hope to call you before long— This writing names Lafont your children's guardian: I doubt you never saw the deed before! Friar. [Looking at it.] A forgery! St. Lo. I thought so. Here's another— And here another—and another yet— [Producing papers. Mortgages, bonds, assignments— Friar. False—all false! Oh, thou most daring knave! Ho! officers, Arrest that man! St. Lo. Psha! they are of no use— They're only sham ones! Oh, I'd give my hand To have a real exempt here! Run and fetch one, Whoever loves me! Laf. Curses on you all! I'll hang myself, and never see their triumph! [Exit, L. Friar. Follow him, some one—let him not escape! [Exeunt, Du Viray, Morluc, and others, L. Du Barré, we have something, each, to pardon— Can you forgive? Elm. As I would be forgiven! I'm yet too dazzled with this sudden joy, To find the words I seek— Friar. I ask no more. I now am grown unfitted for the world, And I am bound by vows to higher service— Yet ere I go, Eugene, one gift, to prove The father's love, the penitent's atonement. [To Margaret.] Maiden, thou lovest this boy? Mar. When first he asked me—when my sunny heart Had never known a cloud—I told him so; And when that trial came, which seemed to part us, Oh, then I felt how truly I had spoken! I may not, now our sky is bright again, Deny what storm and sunshine both have vouched. Friar. [Joining their hands.] Be happy!—Though he were the best on earth, Thou'rt more than worthy of him. Her. Honoured father— Have you no gift for me? Friar. What would'st thou, girl? Her. Hm! Can't you guess?—A husband. Friar. Thou hast had one! Her. That was an old one that my guardian found, Who took me cheap. St. Lo. [To Friar.] Should not you like to have A second brood of little grandchildren? Friar. [Smiling.] What is't to thee? St. Lo. Hm! I'm to be their father! Friar. Thou, rattler! St. Lo. I!—I've earned her honestly. It's the first honest earning of my life— I must not, now, be cheated of my wages! Her. But all your vices? St. Lo. Mended!—every one! Her. You will not swear? St. Lo. Only my love for you! Her. Nor drink? St. Lo. Except the brightness of your eyes! Her. Nor keep bad company? St. Lo. No—only yours! Her. Nor play?—Take care! St. Lo. No—only with the babies! Friar. These are fair promises. What say'st thou, girl? Her. Why, had the world no other man, I think I'd take him, rather than go husbandless. And, since there seems no other man for me, Why—even let me have him! Friar. Be content. Thy father's coming shall not thwart thy will. Be happy, all! Mar. Happy!—Oh, may I dare Apply the word?—Shall all this world of care, These struggling hopes and fears that have possest To-night poor Margaret's anxious, fluttering breast, Conclude in joy?—Nay, then, encouraged so, She's ready all again to undergo: Braving each trial—and repeating, still, Her Sacrifice—as often as you will!
