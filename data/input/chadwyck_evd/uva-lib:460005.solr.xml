      <field name="fulltext">FATAL CURIOSITY: A TRUE TRAGEDY OF THREE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Written by Henry Feilding, Esq; Spoken by Mr. Roberts. The tragic Muse has long forgot to please With Shakespear's Nature, or with Fletcher's Ease: No Passion mov'd, thro' five long Acts you sit, Charm'd with the Poet's Language, or his Wit. Fine Things are said, no matter whence they fall; Each single Character might speak them all. But from this modern fashionable Way, To Night, our Author begs your Leave to stray. No fustian Hero rages here to Night; No Armies fall, to fix a Tyrant's Right: From lower Life we draw our Scene's Distress: âLet not your Equals move your Pity less! Virtue distrest in humble State support; Nor think, she never lives without the Court. Tho' to our Scenes no Royal Robes belong, And tho' our little Stage as yet be young, Throw both your Scorn and Prejudice aside, Let us with Favour, not Contempt be try'd; Thro' the first Acts a kind Attention lend, The growing Scene shall force you to attend; Shall catch the Eyes of every tender Fair, And make them charm their Lovers with a Tear. The Lover too by Pity shall impart His tender Passion to his fair One's Heart: The Breast which others Anguish cannot move, Was ne'er the Seat of Friendship, or of Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Old Wilmot. Mr. Roberts. Young Wilmot. Mr. Davis. Eustace. Mr. Wooburn. Randal. Mr. Blakes. WOMEN. Agnes, Wife to old Wilmot. Mrs. Charke. Charlot. Miss Jones. Maria. Miss Karver. Visiters Men and Women. SCENE, Penryn in Cornwall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A room in Wilmot's house. Old Wilmot alone. The day is far advanced; the chearful sun Pursues with vigour his repeated course; No labour less'ning, nor no time decaying His strength, or splendor: Evermore the same, From age to age his influence sustains Dependent worlds, bestows both life and motion On the dull mass that forms their dusky orbs, Chears them with heat, and gilds them with his brightness. Yet man, of jarring elements composed, Who posts from change to change, from the first hour Of his frail being till his dissolution, Enjoys the sad prerogative above him, To think, and to be wretchedâWhat is life, To him that's born to die! or what that wisdom Whose perfection ends, in knowing we know nothing! Meer contradiction all! A tragick farce, Tedious tho' short, and without art elab'rate, Ridiculously sadâ Enter Randal. Where hast been, Randal? Rand. Not out of Penryn, sir; but to the strand, To hear what news from Falmouth since the storm Of wind last night. O. Wilm. It was a dreadful one. Rand. Some found it so. A noble ship from India Ent'ring in the harbour, run upon a rock, And there was lost. O. Wilm. What came of those on board her? Rand. Some few are saved, but much the greater part, 'Tis thought, are perished. O. Wilm. They are past the fear Of future tempests, or a wreck on shore; Those who escaped, are still exposed to both. Rand. But I've heard news, much stranger than this ship-wrack Here in Cornwall. The brave Sir Walter Raleigh, Being arrived at Plymouth from Guiana, A most unhappy voyage, has been betray'd By base Sir Lewis Stukeley, his own kinsman, And seiz'd on by an order from the court; And 'tis reported, he must lose his head, To satisfy the Spaniards. O. Wilm. Not unlikely; His martial genius does not suit the times. There's now no insolence that Spain can offer, But to the shame of this pacifick reign, Poor England must submit toâGallant man! Posterity perhaps may do thee justice, And praise thy courage, learning and integrity, When thou'rt past hearing: Thy successful enemies, Much sooner paid, have their reward in hand, And know for what they labour'd.âSuch events Must, questionless, excite all thinking men, To love and practise virtue! Rand. Nay; 'tis certain, That virtue ne'er appears so like itself, So truly bright and great, as when opprest. O. Wilm. I understand no riddles.âWhere's your Mistress? Rand. I saw her pass the High-street t'wards the minster. O. Wilm. She's gone to visit CharlotâShe doth well. In the soft bosom of that gentle maid, There dwells more goodness, than the rigid race Of moral pedants, e'er believ'd, or taught. With what amazing constancy and truth, Doth she sustain the absence of our son, Whom more than life she loves! How shun for him, Whom we shall ne'er see more, the rich and great; Who own her charms more than supply the want Of shining heaps, and sigh to make her happy. Since our misfortunes, we have found no friend, None who regarded our distress, but her; And she, by what I have observed of late, Is tired, or exhaustedâcurst Condition! To live a burden to one only friend, And blast her youth with our contagious woe! Who that had reason, soul, or sense would bear it A moment longer!âThen this honest wretch!â I must dismiss himâWhy should I detain, A grateful, gen'rous youth to perish with me? His service may procure him bread elsewhere, Tho' I have none to give him.âPrithee, Randal! How long hast thou been with me? Rand. Fifteen years. I was a very child when first you took me, To wait upon your son, my dear young master! I oft have wish'd, I'd gone to India with him; Tho' you, desponding, give him o'er for lost. [Old Wilmot wipes his eyes.] I am to blameâThis talk revives your sorrow For his absence. O. Wilm. How can that be reviv'd, Which never died? Rand. The whole of my intent Was to confess your bounty, that supplied The loss of both my parents: I was long The object of your charitable care. O. Wilm. No more of that: Thou'st served me longer since Without reward; so that account is balanced, Or rather I'm thy debtorâI remember, When poverty began to show her face Within these walls, and all my other servants, Like pamper'd vermin from a falling house, Retreated with the plunder they had gain'd, And left me, too indulgent and remiss For such ungrateful wretches, to be crush'd Beneath the ruin they had helped to make, That you, more good than wise, refused to leave me. Rand. Nay, I beseech you, sir!â O. Wilm. With my distress, In perfect contradiction to the world, Thy love, respect and diligence increased; Now all the recompence within my power, Is to discharge thee, Randal, from my hard, Unprofitable service. Rand. Heaven! forbid. Shall I forsake you in your worst necessity?â Believe me, sir! my honest soul abhors That barb'rous thought. O. Wilm. What! canst thou feed on air? I have not left wherewith to purchase food For one meal more. Rand. Rather than leave you thus, I'll beg my bread, and live on others bounty While I serve you. O. Wilm. Down, down my swelling heart, Or burst in silence: 'Tis thy cruel fate Insults thee by his kindnessâHe is innocent Of all the pain it gives theeâGo thy waysâ I will no more suppress thy youthful hopes Of rising in the world. Rand. 'Tis true; I'm young, And never tried my fortune, or my genius; Which may perhaps find out some happy means, As yet unthought of, to supply your wants. O. Wilm. Thou tortur'st meâI hate all obligations Which I can ne'er returnâAnd who art thou, That I shou'd stoop to take 'em from thy hand! Care for thy self, but take no thought for me; I will not want theeâtrouble me no more. Rand. Be not offended, sir! and I will go. I ne'er repined at your commands before; But, heaven's my witness! I obey you now With strong reluctance, and a heavy heart. Farewel, my worthy master! [Going.] O. Wilm. FarewelâStayâ As thou art yet a stranger to the world, Of which alas! I've had too much experience, I shou'd, methinks, before we part, bestow A little counsel on theeâDry thy eyesâ If thou weep'st thus, I shall proceed no farther. Dost thou aspire to greatness, or to wealth, Quit books and the unprofitable search Of wisdom there, and study human kind: No science will avail thee without that; But that obtain'd, thou need'st not any other. This will instruct thee to conceal thy views, And wear the face of probity and honour, 'Till thou hast gain'd thy end; which must be ever Thy own advantage, at that man's expence Who shall be weak enough to think thee honest. Rand. You mock me, sure. O. Wilm. I never was more serious. Rand. Why should you counsel what you scorned to practise? O. Wilm. Because that foolish scorn has been my ruin. I've been an idiot, but would have thee wiser, And treat mankind, as they would treat thee, Randal, As they deserve, and I've been treated by 'em. Thou'st seen by me, and those who now despise me, How men of fortune fall, and beggars rise; Shun my example; treasure up my precepts; The world's before theeâbe a knave, and prosper. What art thou dumb? [After a long pause.] Rand. Amazement ties my tongue. Where are your former principles? O. Wilm. No matter; Suppose I have renounced 'em: I have passions, And love thee still; therefore would have thee think, The world is all a scene of deep deceit, And he who deals with mankind on the square, Is his own bubble, and undoes himself. [Exit.] Rand. Is this the man, I thought so wise and just? What teach, and counsel me to be a villain! Sure grief has made him frantick, or some fiend Assum'd his shapeâI shall suspect my senses. High-minded he was ever, and improvident; But pitiful and generous to a fault: Pleasure he loved, but honour was his idol. O fatal change! O horrid transformation! So a majestick temple sunk to ruin, Becomes the loathsome shelter and abode Of lurking serpents, toads, and beasts of prey; And scaly dragons hiss, and lions roar, Where wisdom taught, and musick charm'd before. SCENE II. A parlour in Charlot's house. Enter Charlot and Maria. Char. What terror and amazement must they feel Who die by ship-wrack! Mar. 'Tis a dreadful thought! Char. Ay; is it not, Maria! to descend, Living and conscious, to that watry tomb? Alas! had we no sorrows of our own, The frequent instances of others woe, Must give a gen'rous mind a world of pain. But you forget you promised me to sing. Tho' chearfulness and I have long been strangers, Harmonious sounds are still delightful to me. There is in melody a secret charm That flatters, while it adds to my disquiet, And makes the deepest sadness the most pleasing. There's sure no passion in the human soul, But finds its food in musickâI wou'd hear The song composed by that unhappy maid, Whose faithful lover scaped a thousand perils From rocks, and sands, and the devouring deep; And after all, being arrived at home, Passing a narrow brook, was drowned there, And perished in her sight. SONG. Mar. Cease, cease, heart-easing tears; Adieu, you flatt'ring fears, Which seven long tedious years Taught me to bear. Tears are for lighter woes; Fear no such danger knows, As fate remorseless shows, Endless despair. Dear cause of all my pain, On the wide stormy main, Thou wast preserved in vain, Tho' still adored; Had'st thou died there unseen, My blasted eyes had been Saved from the horrid'st scene Maid e'er deplored. [Charlot finds a letter. Char. What's this?âA letter superscribed to me! None could convey it here but you, Maria. Ungen'rous, cruel maid! to use me thus! To join with flatt'ring men to break my peace, And persecute me to the last retreat! Mar. Why should it break your peace, to hear the sighs Of honourable love, and know th'effects Of your resistless charms? This letter isâ Char. No matter whenceâreturn it back unopen'd: I have no love, no charms but for my Wilmot, Nor would have any. Mar. Strange infatuation! Why should you waste the flower of your days In fruitless expectationâWilmot's dead; Or living, dead to you. Char. I'll not despair, Patience shall cherish hope, nor wrong his honour By unjust suspicion. I know his truth, And will preserve my own. But to prevent All future, vain, officious importunity, Know, thou incessant foe of my repose, Whether he sleeps secure from mortal cares, In the deep bosom of the boist'rous main, Or tost with tempests, still endures its rage; Whether his weary pilgrimage by land Has found an end, and he now rests in peace In earth's cold womb, or wanders o'er her face; Be it my lot to waste, in pining grief, The remnant of my days for his known loss, Or live, as now, uncertain and in doubt, No second choice shall violate my vows: High heaven, which heard them, and abhors the perjured, Can witness, they were made without reserve; Never to be retracted, ne'er dissolved By accidents or absence, time or death. Mar. I know, and long have known, my honest zeal To serve you gives offenceâBut be offendedâ This is no time for flatt'ryâDid your vows Oblige you to support his gloomy, proud, Impatient parents, to your utter ruinâ You well may weep to think on what you've done. Char. I weep to think that I can do no more For their supportâWhat will become of 'em!â The hoary, helpless, miserable pair! Mar. Then all these tears, this sorrow is for them. Char. Taught by afflictions, I have learn'd to bear Much greater ills than poverty with patience. When luxury and ostentation's banish'd, The calls of nature are but few; and those These hands, not used to labour, may supply. But when I think on what my friends must suffer, My spirits fail, and I'm o'erwhelm'd with grief. Mar. What I wou'd blame, you force me to admire, And mourn for you, as you lament for them. Your patience, constancy, and resignation Merit a better fate. Char. So pride would tell me, And vain self-love, but I believe them not: And if by wanting pleasure I have gained Humility, I'm richer for my loss. Mar. You have the heavenly art, still to improve Your Mind by all eventsâBut here comes one, Whose pride seems to increase with her misfortunes. Enter Agnes. Her faded dress unfashionably fine, As ill conceals her poverty, as that Strain'd complaisance her haughty, swelling heart. Tho' perishing with want, so far from asking, She ne'er receives a favour uncompelled, And while she ruins, scorns to be obliged: She wants me gone, and I abhor her sight, [Ex. Mar. Char. This visit's kind. Agn. Few else would think it so: Those who would once have thought themselves much honoured By the least favour, tho' 'twere but a look, I could have shewn them, now refuse to see me. 'Tis Misery enough to be reduced To the low level of the common herd, Who born to begg'ry, envy all above them; But 'tis the curse of curses, to endure The insolent contempt of those we scorn. Char. By scorning, we provoke them to contempt; And thus offend, and suffer in our turns: We must have patience. Agn. No, I scorn them yet. But there's no end of suff'ring: Who can say Their sorrows are compleat? My wretched husband, Tired with our woes, and hopeless of relief, Grows sick of life. Char. May gracious heaven support him! Agn. And, urged by indignation and despair, Would plunge into eternity at once, By foul self-murder: His fixed love for me, Whom he would fain persuade to share his fate, And take the same, uncertain, dreadful course, Alone withholds his hand. Char. And may it ever! Agn. I've known with him the two extremes of life, The highest happiness, and deepest woe, With all the sharp and bitter aggravations Of such a vast transitionâSuch a fall In the decline of life!âI have as quick, As exquisite a sense of pain as he, And wou'd do any thing, but die, to end it; But there my courage failsâDeath is the worst That fate can bring, and cuts off ev'ry hope. Char. We must not chuse, but strive to bear our lot Without reproach, or guilt: But by one act Of desperation, we may overthrow The merit we've been raising all our days; And lose our whole rewardâAnd now, methinks, Now more than ever, we have cause to fear, And be upon our guard. The hand of heaven Spreads clouds on clouds o'er our benighted heads, And wrapt in darkness, doubles our distress. I had, the night last past, repeated twice, A strange and awful dream: I would not yield To fearful superstition, nor despise The admonition of a friendly power That wished my good. Agn. I've certain plagues enough, Without the help of dreams, to make me wretched. Char. I wou'd not stake my happiness or duty On their uncertain credit, nor on aught But reason, and the known decrees of heaven. Yet dreams have sometimes shewn events to come, And may excite to vigilance and care, In some important hour; when all our weakness Shall be attacked, and all our strength be needful, To shun the gulph that gapes for our destruction, And fly from guilt, and everlasting ruin. My vision may be such, and sent to warn us, Now we are tried by multiplied afflictions, To mark each motion of our swelling hearts, And not attempt to extricate ourselves, And seek deliverance by forbidden ways: But keep our hopes and innocence entire, 'Till we're dismist to join the happy dead In that bless'd world, where transitory pain And frail imperfect virtue, is rewarded With endless pleasure and consummate joy; Or heaven relieves us here. Agn. Well, pray proceed; You've rais'd my curiosity at least. Char. Methought, I sate, in a dark winter's night, My garments thin, my head and bosom bare, On the wide summit of a barren mountain; Defenceless and exposed, in that high region, To all the cruel rigors of the season. The sharp bleak winds pierced thro' my shiv'ring frame, And storms of hail, and sleet, and driving rains Beat with impetuous fury on my head, Drench'd my chill'd limbs, and pour'd a deluge round me. On one hand, ever gentle patience sate, On whose calm bosom I reclin'd my head; And on the other, silent contemplation. At length, to my unclosed and watchful eyes, That long had roll'd in darkness, and oft raised Their chearless orbs towards the starless sky, And sought for light in vain, the dawn appeared; And I beheld a man, an utter stranger, But of a graceful and exalted mein, Who press'd with eager transport to embrace me. âI shunn'd his armsâBut at some words he spoke, Which I have now forgot, I turn'd again, But he was goneâAnd oh! transporting sight! Your son, my dearest Wilmot! fill'd his place. Agn. If I regarded dreams, I should expect Some fair event from yours: I have heard nothing That should alarm you yet. Char. But what's to come, Tho' more obscure, is terrible indeed. Methought we parted soon, and when I sought him, You and his fatherâYes, you both were thereâ Strove to conceal him from me: I pursued You with my cries, and call'd on heaven and earth To judge my wrongs, and force you to reveal Where you had hid my love, my life, my Wilmot!â Agn. Unless you mean t'affront me, spare the rest. 'Tis just as likely Wilmot should return, As we become your foes. Char. Far be such rudeness From Charlot's thoughts: But when I heard you name Self-murder, it reviv'd the frightful image of such a dreadful scene. Agn. You will persist!â Char. Excuse me; I have done. Being a Dream, I thought, indeed, it cou'd not give offence. Agn. Not when the matter of it is offensive!â You cou'd not think so, had you thought at all; But I take nothing ill from theeâAdieu; I've tarried longer than I first intended, And my poor husband mourns the while alone. [Exit Agnes. Char. She's gone abruptly, and I fear displeas'd. The least appearance of advice or caution, Sets her impatient temper in a flame. When grief, that well might humble, swells our pride, And pride increasing, aggravates our grief, The tempest must prevail 'till we are lost. When heaven, incensed, proclaims unequal war With guilty earth, and sends its shafts from far, No bolt descends to strike, no flame to burn The humble shrubs that in low valleys mourn; While mountain pines, whose lofty heads aspire To fan the storm, and wave in fields of fire, And stubborn oaks that yield not to its force, Are burnt, o'erthrown, or shiver'd in its course. SCENE III. The town and port of Penryn. Enter Young Wilmot and Eustace in Indian habits. Y. Wilm. Welcome, my friend! to Penryn: Here we're safe. Eust. Then we're deliver'd twice; first from the sea, And then from savage men, who, more remorseless, Prey on shipwreck'd wretches, and spoil and murder those Whom fatal tempests and devouring waves, In all their fury, spar'd. Y. Wilm. It is a scandal, Tho' malice must acquit the better sort, The rude unpolisht people here in Cornwall Have long laid under, and with too much justice: Cou'd our superiors find some happy means To mend it, they would gain immortal honour. For 'tis an evil grown almost inv'terate, And asks a bold and skilful hand to cure. Eust. Your treasure's safe, I hope. Y. Wilm. 'Tis here, thank heaven! Being in jewels, when I saw our danger, I hid it in my bosom. Eust. I observed you, And wonder how you could command your thoughts, In such a time of terror and confusion. Y. Wilm. My thoughts were then at homeâO England! England! Thou seat of plenty, liberty and health, With transport I behold thy verdant fields, Thy lofty mountains rich with useful ore, Thy numerous herds, thy flocks, and winding streams: After a long and tedious absence, Eustace! With what delight we breath our native air, And tread the genial soil that bore us first. 'Tis said, the world is ev'ry wise man's country; Yet after having view'd its various nations, I'm weak enough still to prefer my own To all I've seen besideâYou smile, my friend! And think, perhaps, 'tis instinct more than reason: Why be it so. Instinct preceded reason In the wisest of us all, and may sometimes Be much the better guide. But be it either; I must confess, that even death itself Appeared to me with twice its native horrors, When apprehended in a foreign land. Death is, no doubt, in ev'ry place the same; Yet observation must convince us, most men, Who have it in their power, chuse to expire Where they first drew their breath. Eust. Believe me, Wilmot! Your grave reflections were not what I smil'd at; I own their truth. That we're return'd to England Affords me all the pleasure you can feel Merely on that account: Yet I must think A warmer passion gives you all this transport. You have not wander'd, anxious and impatient, From clime to clime, and compast sea and land To purchase wealth, only to spend your days In idle pomp, and luxury at home: I know thee better: Thou art brave and wise, And must have nobler aims. Y. Wilm. O Eustace! Eustace! Thou knowest, for I've confest to thee, I love; But having never seen the charming maid, Thou canst not know the fierceness of my flame. My hopes and fears, like the tempestuous seas That we have past, now mount me to the skies, Now hurl me down from that stupendous height, And drive me to the center. Did you know How much depends on this important hour, You wou'd not be surprized to see me thus. The sinking fortune of our ancient house, Which time and various accidents had wasted, Compelled me young to leave my native country, My weeping parents, and my lovely Charlot; Who ruled, and must for ever rule my sate. How I've improved, by care and honest commerce, My little stock, you are in part a witness. 'Tis now seven tedious years, since I set forth; And as th'uncertain course of my affairs Bore me from place to place, I quickly lost The means of corresponding with my friends. âO! shou'd my Charlot! doubtful of my truth, Or in despair ever to see me more, Have given herself to some more happy lover!â Distraction's in the thought!âOr shou'd my parents, Grieved for my absence and opprest with want, Have sunk beneath their burden, and expired, While I too late was flying to relieve them; The end of all my long and weary travels, The hope, that made success itself a blessing, Being defeated and for ever lost; What were the riches of the world to me? Eust. The wretch who fears all that is possible, Must suffer more than he who feels the worst A man can feel, who lives exempt from fear. A woman may be false, and friends are mortal; And yet your aged parents may be living, And your fair mistress constant. Y. Wilm. True, they may; I doubt, but I despair notâNo, my friend! My hopes are strong and lively as my fears, And give me such a prospect of my happiness, As nothing but fruition can exceed: They tell me, Charlot is as true as fair, As good as wise, as passionate as chaste; That she with fierce impatience, like my own, Laments our long and painful separation; That we shall meet, never to part again; That I shall see my parents, kiss the tears From their pale hollow cheeks, chear their sad hearts, And drive that gaping phantom, meagre want, For ever from their board; crown all their days To come with peace, with pleasure, and abundance; Receive their fond embraces and their blessings, And be a blessing to 'em. Eust. 'Tis our weakness:â Blind to events, we reason in the dark, And fondly apprehend what none e'er found, Or ever shall, pleasure and pain unmixt; And flatter, and torment ourselves, by turns, With what shall never be. Y. Wilm. I'll go this instant To seek my Charlot, and explore my fate. Eust. What in that foreign habit! Y. Wilm. That's a trifle, Not worth my thoughts. Eust. The hardships you've endured, And your long stay beneath the burning zone, Where one eternal sultry summer reigns, Have marr'd the native hue of your complexion: Methinks you look more like a sun-burnt Indian, Than a Briton. Y. Wilm. Well 'tis no matter, Eustace! I hope my mind's not alter'd for the worse; And for my outsideâBut inform me, friend! When I may hope to see you. Eust. When you please: You'll find me at the inn. Y. Wilm. When I have learnt my doom, expect me there. 'Till then, farewel! Eust. Farewel! Success attend you! [Ex. Eustace. Y. Wilm. âWe flatter, and torment ourselves, by turns, âWith what shall never be.â Amazing folly! We stand exposed to many unavoidable Calamities, and therefore fondly labour T'increase their number, and inforce their weight, By our fantastick hopes and groundless fears. For one severe distress imposed by fate, What numbers doth tormenting fear create? Deceived by hope, Ixion like, we prove Immortal joys, and seem to rival Jove; The cloud dissolv'd, impatient we complain, And pay for fancied bliss substantial pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Charlot's house. Enter Charlot thoughtful; and soon after Maria from the other side. Mar. Madam, a stranger in a foreign habit Desires to see you. Char. In a foreign habitâ 'Tis strange, and unexpectedâBut admit him. [Exit Maria.] Who can this stranger be? I know no foreigner, Enter young Wilmot. âNor any man like this. Y. Wilm. Ten thousand joys!â [Going to embrace her.] Char. You are rude, sirâPray forbear, and let me know What business brought you here, or leave the place. Y. Wilm. She knows me not, or will not seem to know me. [Aside.] Perfidious maid! Am I forgot or scorned? Char. Strange questions from a man I never knew! Y. Wilm. With what aversion, and contempt she views me! My fears are true; some other has her heart: âShe's lostâMy fatal absence has undone me. [Aside.] âO! cou'd thy Wilmot have forgot thee, Charlot! Char. Ha! Wilmot! say! what do your words import? O gentle stranger! ease my swelling heart That else will burst! Canst thou inform me ought?â What dost thou know of Wilmot? Y. Wilm. This I know. When all the winds of heaven seem'd to conspire Against the stormy main, and dreadful peals Of rattling thunder deafen'd ev'ry ear, And drown'd th'affrighten'd mariners loud cries; While livid lightning spread its sulphurous flames Thro' all the dark horizon, and disclosed The raging seas incensed to his destruction; When the good ship in which he was embark'd, Unable longer to support the tempest, Broke, and o'erwhelm'd by the impetuous surge, Sunk to the oozy bottom of the deep, And left him struggling with the warring waves; In that dread moment, in the jaws of death, When his strength fail'd, and ev'ry hope forsook him, And his last breath press'd t'wards his trembling lips, The neighbouring rocks, that ecchoed to his moan, Returned no sound articulate, but Charlot. Char. The fatal tempest, whose description strikes The hearer with astonishment, is ceased; And Wilmot is at rest. The fiercer storm Of swelling passions that o'erwhelms the soul, And rages worse than the mad foaming seas In which he perish'd, ne'er shall vex him more. Y. Wilm. Thou seem'st to think he's dead; enjoy that thought; Persuade yourself that what you wish is true, And triumph in your falshoodâYes, he's dead; You were his fate. The cruel winds and waves, That cast him pale and breathless on the shore, Spared him for greater woesâTo know his Charlot, Forgetting all her vows to him and heaven, Had cast him from her thoughtsâThen, then he died; But never must have rest. Ev'n now he wanders, A sad, repining, discontented ghost, The unsubstantial shadow of himself, And pours his plaintive groans in thy deaf ears, And stalks, unseen, before thee. Char. 'Tis enoughâ Detested falshood now has done its worst. And art thou dead?âAnd wou'd'st thou die, my Wilmot! For one thou thought'st unjust?âThou soul of truth! What must be done?âWhich way shall I express Unutterable woe? Or how convince Thy dear departed spirit of the love, Th'eternal love, and never-failing faith Of thy much injur'd, lost, despairing Charlot? Y. Wilm. Be still, my flutt'ring heart; hope not too soon: Perhaps I dream, and this is all illusion. Char. If as some teach, the mind intuitive, Free from the narrow bounds and slavish ties Of sordid earth, that circumscribe its power While it remains below, roving at large, Can trace us to our most concealed retreat, See all we act, and read our very thoughts; To thee, O Wilmot! kneeling I appeal, If e'er I swerv'd in action, word, or thought From the severest constancy and truth, Or ever wish'd to taste a joy on earth That center'd not in thee, since last we parted; May we ne'er meet again, but thy loud wrongs So close the ear of mercy to my cries, That I may never see those bright abodes Where truth and virtue only have admission, And thou inhabit'st now. Y. Wilm. Assist me, heaven! Preserve my reason, memory and sense! O moderate my fierce tumultuous joys, Or their excess will drive me to distraction. O Charlot! Charlot! lovely, virtuous maid! Can thy firm mind, in spite of time and absence, Remain unshaken, and support its truth; And yet thy frailer memory retain No image, no idea of thy lover? Why dost thou gaze so wildly? Look on me; Turn thy dear eyes this way; observe me well. Have scorching climates, time, and this strange habit So changed, and so disguised thy faithful Wilmot, That nothing in my voice, my face, or mien, Remains to tell my Charlot I am he? [After viewing him some time, she approaches weeping, and gives him her hand; and then turning towards him, sinks upon his bosom.] Why dost thou weep? Why dost thou tremble thus? Why doth thy panting heart and cautious touch Speak thee but half convinc'd? Whence are thy fears? Why art thou silent? Canst thou doubt me still? Char. No, Wilmot! no; I'm blind with too much light: O'ercome with wonder, and opprest with joy, The struggling passions barr'd the doors of speech; But speech enlarg'd, affords me no relief. This vast profusion of extream delight, Rising at once, and bursting from despair, Defies the aid of words, and mocks description: But for one sorrow, one sad scene of anguish, That checks the swelling torrent of my joys, I could not bear the transport. Y. Wilm. Let me know it: Give me my portion of thy sorrow, Charlot! Let me partake thy grief, or bear it for thee. Char. Alas! my Wilmot! these sad tears are thine; They flow for thy misfortunes. I am pierced With all the agonies of strong compassion, With all the bitter anguish you must feel, When you shall hear your parentsâ Y. Wilm. Are no more. Char. You apprehend me wrong. Y. Wilm. Perhaps I do: Perhaps you mean to say, the greedy grave Was satisfied with one, and one is left To bless my longing eyesâBut which, my Charlot! âAnd yet forbear to speak, 'till I have thoughtâ Char. Nay, hear me, Wilmot! Y. Wilm. I perforce must hear thee. For I might think 'till death, and not determine, Of two so dear which I could bear to lose. Char. Afflict your self no more with groundless fears: Your parents both are living. Their distress, The poverty to which they are reduced, In spight of my weak aid, was what I mourned; And that in helpless age, to them whose youth Was crown'd with full prosperity, I fear, Is worse, much worse, than death. Y. Wilm. My joy's compleat! My parents living, and possess'd of thee!â From this blest hour, the happiest of my life, I'll date my rest. My anxious hopes and fears, My weary travels, and my dangers past, Are now rewarded all: Now I rejoice In my success, and count my riches gain. For know, my soul's best treasure! I have wealth Enough to glut ev'n avarice itself: No more shall cruel want, or proud contempt, Oppress the sinking spirits, or insult The hoary heads of those who gave me being. Char. 'Tis now, O riches, I conceive your worth: You are not base, nor can you be superfluous, But when misplac'd in base and sordid hands. Fly, fly, my Wilmot! leave thy happy Charlot! Thy filial piety, the sighs and tears Of thy lamenting parents call thee hence. Y. Wilm. I have a friend, the partner of my voyage, Who, in the storm last night, was shipwrack'd with me. Char. Shipwrackt last night!âO you immortal powers! What have you suffer'd! How was you preserv'd! Y. Wilm. Let that, and all my other strange escapes And perilous adventures, be the theme Of many a happy winter night to come. My present purpose was t'intreat my angel, To know this friend, this other better Wilmot; And come with him this evening to my father's: I'll send him to thee. Char. I consent with pleasure. Y. Wilm. Heavens! what a night!âHow shall I bear my joy! My parents, yours, my friends, all will be mine, And mine, like water, air, or the free splendid sun, The undivided portion of you all. If such the early hopes, the vernal bloom, The distant prospect of my future bliss, Then what the ruddy autumn!âWhat the fruit!â The full possession of thy heavenly charms! The tedious, dark, and stormy winter o'er; The hind, that all its pinching hardships bore, With transport sees the weeks appointed bring The chearful, promis'd, gay, delightful spring; The painted meadows, the harmonious woods, The gentle Zephyrs, and unbridled floods, With all their charms, his ravished thoughts imploy, But the rich harvest must compleat his joy. SCENE II. A street in Penryn. Enter Randal. Rand. Poor! poor! and friendless! whither shall I wander, And to what point direct my views and hopes?â A menial servant!âNoâWhat shall I live, Here in this land of freedom, live distinguished, And marked the willing slave of some proud subject, And swell his useless train for broken fragments; The cold remains of his superfluous board?â I wou'd aspire to something more and betterâ Turn thy eyes then to the prolifick ocean, Whose spacious bosom opens to thy view: There deathless honour, and unenvied wealth Have often crowned the brave adventurer's toils. This is the native uncontested right, The fair inheritance of ev'ry Briton That dares put in his claimâMy choice is made: A long farewel to Cornwall, and to England; If I returnâBut stay, what stranger's this, Who, as he views me, seems to mend his pace? Enter young Wilmot. Y. Wilm. Randal!âThe dear companion of my Youth!â Sure lavish fortune means to give me all I could desire, or ask for this blest day, And leave me nothing to expect hereafter. Rand. Your pardon, sir! I know but one on earth Cou'd properly salute me by the title You're pleased to give me, and I would not think, That you are heâThat you are Wilmot.â Y. Wilm. Why? Rand. Because I cou'd not bear the disappointment Shou'd I be deceived. Y. Wilm. I am pleased to hear it: Thy friendly fears better express thy thoughts Than words could do. Rand. O! Wilmot! O! my master! Are you returned? Y. Wilm. I have not yet embraced My parentsâI shall see you at my father's. Rand. No, I'm discharged from thenceâO sir! such ruinâ Y. W. I've heard it all, and hasten to relieve 'em: Sure heaven hath blessed me to that very end: I've wealth enough; nor shalt thou want a part. Rand. I have a part alreadyâI am blest In your success, and share in all your joys. Y. Wilm. I doubt it notâBut tell me, dost thou think, My parents not suspecting my return, That I may visit them, and not be known? Rand. 'Tis hard for me to judge. You are already Grown so familiar to me, that I wonder I knew you not at first: Yet it may be; For you're much alter'd, and they think you dead. Y. Wilm. This is certain; Charlot beheld me long, And heard my loud reproaches, and complaints Without rememb'ring she had ever seen me. My mind at ease grows wanton: I wou'd fain Refine on happiness. Why may I not Indulge my curiosity and try If it be possible by seeing first My parents as a stranger, to improve Their pleasure by surprize? Rand. It may indeed Inhance your own, to see from what despair Your timely coming, and unhoped success Have given you power to raise them. Y. Wilm. I remember, E'er since we learned together you excelled In writing fairly, and could imitate Whatever hand you saw with great exactness. Of this I'm not so absolute a master. I therefore beg you'll write, in Charlot's name And character, a letter to my father; And recommend me, as a friend of hers, To his acquaintance. Rand. Sir, if you desire itâ And yetâ Y. Wilm. Nay, no objectionsâ'Twill save time, Most precious with me now. For the deception, If doing what my Charlot will approve, 'Cause done for me and with a good intent, Deserves the name, I'll answer it my self. If this succeeds, I purpose to defer Discov'ring who I am 'till Charlot comes, And thou, and all who love me. Ev'ry friend Who witnesses my happiness to night, Will, by partaking, multiply my joys. Ran. You grow luxurious in your mental pleasures: Cou'd I deny you aught, I would not write This letter. To say true, I ever thought Your boundless curiosity a weakness. Y. Wilm. What canst thou blame in this? Rand. Your pardon, Sir! I only speak in general: I'm ready T'obey your orders. Y. Wilm. I am much thy debtor, But I shall find a time to quit thy kindness. O Randal! but imagine to thyself The floods of transport, the sincere delight That all my friends will feel, when I disclose To my astonished parents my return; And then confess, that I have well contrived By giving others joy t'exalt my own. As pain, and anguish, in a gen'rous mind, While kept concealed and to ourselves confined, Want half their force; so pleasure when it flows In torrents round us more extatick grows. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A room in old Wilmot's house. Old Wilmot and Agnes. O. Wilm. Here, take this Seneca, this haughty pedant, Who governing the master of mankind, And awing power imperial, prates ofâpatience; And praises povertyâpossess'd of millions: âSell him, and buy us bread. The scantiest meal The vilest copy of his book e'er purchased, Will give us more relief in this distress, Than all his boasted precepts.âNay, no tears; Keep them to move compassion when you beg. Agn. My heart may break, but never stoop to that. O. Wilm. Nor wou'd I live to see itâBut dispatch. [Exit Agnes. Where must I charge this length of misery, That gathers force each moment as it rolls, And must at last o'erwhelm me; but on hope, Vain, flattering, delusive, groundless hope; A senseless expectation of relief That has for years deceived me?âHad I thought As I do now, as wise men ever think, When first this hell of poverty o'ertook me, That power to die implies a right to do it, And shou'd be used when life becomes a pain, What plagues had I prevented?âTrue, my wife Is still a slave to prejudice and fearâ I would not leave my better part, the dear [Weeps. Faithful companion of my happier days, To bear the weight of age and want alone. âI'll try once moreâ Enter Agnes, and after her young Wilmot. O. Wilm. Returned, my life! so soon!â Agn. The unexpected coming of this stranger Prevents my going yet. Y. Wilm. You're, I presume, The gentleman to whom this is directed. [Gives a letter What wild neglect, the token of despair, What indigence, what misery appears In each disorder'd, or disfurnished room Of this once gorgeous house? What discontent, What anguish and confusion fill the faces Of its dejected owners? O. Wilm. Sir, such welcome As this poor house affords, you may command. Our ever friendly neighbourâOnce we hoped T'have called fair Charlot by a dearer nameâ But we have done with hopeâI pray excuse This incoherenceâWe had once a son. [Weeps. Agn. That you are come from that dear virtuous maid, Revives in us the mem'ry of a loss, Which, tho' long since, we have not learned to bear. Y. Wilm. The joy to see them, and the bitter pain It is to see them thus, touches my soul With tenderness and grief, that will o'erflow. My bosom heaves and swells, as it would burst; My bowels move, and my heart melts within me. âThey know me not, and yet, I fear, I shall Defeat my purpose, and betray myself. [Aside. O. Wilm. The lady calls you here her valued friend; Enough, tho' nothing more should be implied, To recommend you to our best esteem, âA worthless acquisition!âMay she find Some means that better may express her kindness; But she, perhaps, hath purposed to inrich You with herself, and end her fruitless sorrow For one whom death alone can justify For leaving her so long. If it be so, May you repair his loss, and be to Charlot A second, happier Wilmot. Partial nature, Who only favours youth, as feeble age Were not her offspring or below her care, Has seal'd our doom: No second hope shall spring From my dead loins, and Agnes' steril womb, To dry our tears, and dissipate despair. Agn. The last and most abandon'd of our kind, By heaven and earth neglected or despised, The loathsom grave, that robb'd us of our son And all our joys in him, must be our refuge. Y. W. Let ghosts unpardon'd, or devoted fiends, Fear without hope, and wail in such sad strains; But grace defend the living from despair. The darkest hours precede the rising sun; And mercy may appear, when least expected. O. W. This I have heard a thousand times repeated, And have, believing, been as oft deceived. Y. Wilm. Behold in me an instance of its truth, At Sea twice shipwrack'd, and as oft the prey Of lawless pyrates; by the Arabs thrice Surpriz'd, and robb'd on shore; and one reduced To worse than these, the sum of all distress That the most wretched feel on this side hell, Ev'n slavery itself: Yet here I stand, Except one trouble that will quickly end, The happiest of mankind. O. Wilm. A rare example Of fortune's caprice; apter to surprize, Or entertain, than comfort, or instruct. If you wou'd reason from events, be just, And count, when you escaped, how many perished; And draw your inf'rence thence. Agn. Alas! who knows, But we were rendred childless by some storm, In which you, tho' preserved, might bear a part. Y. Wilm. How has my curiosity betray'd me Into superfluous pain! I faint with fondness; And shall, if I stay longer, rush upon 'em, Proclaim myself their son, kiss and embrace 'em Till their souls, transported with the excess Of pleasure and surprize, quit their frail mansions, And leave 'em breathless in my longing arms. By circumstances then and slow degrees, They must be let into a happiness Too great for them to bear at once, and live: That Charlot will perform: I need not feign To ask an hour for rest. (Aside.) Sir, I intreat The favour to retire where, for a while, I may repose my self. You will excuse This freedom, and the trouble that I give you: 'Tis long since I have slept, and nature calls. O. Wilm. I pray no more: Believe we're only troubled, That you shou'd think any excuse were needful. Y. W. The weight of this is some incumbrance to me. [Takes a casket out of his bosom and gives it to his mother.] And its contents of value: If you please To take the charge of it 'till I awake, I shall not rest the worse. If I shou'd sleep 'Till I am ask'd for, as perhaps I may, I beg that you wou'd wake me. Agn. Doubt it not: Distracted as I am with various woes, I shall remember that. [Exit. Y. Wilm. Merciless grief! What ravage has it made! how has it changed Her lovely form and mind! I feel her anguish, And dread I know not what from her despair. My father tooâO grant 'em patience, heaven! A little longer, a few short hours more, And all their cares, and mine, shall end for ever. How near is misery and joy ally'd! Nor eye, nor thought can their extreams divide: A moment's space is long, and light'ning slow To fate descending to reverse our woe, Or blast our hopes, and all our joys o'erthrow. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The scene continued. Enter Agnes alone, with the casket in her hand. Who shou'd this stranger be?âAnd then this casketâ He says it is of value, and yet trusts it, As if a trifle, to a stranger's handâ His confidence amazes meâPerhaps It is not what he saysâI'm strongly tempted To open it, and seeâNo, let it rest. Why should my curiosity excite me, To search and pry into th'affairs of others; Who have t'imploy my thoughts, so many cares And sorrows of my own?âWith how much ease The spring gives way?âSurprizing! most prodigious!â My eyes are dazzled, and my ravished heart Leaps at the glorious sightâHow bright's the lustre, How immense the worth of these fair jewels? Ay, such a treasure wou'd expel for ever Base poverty, and all its abject train; The mean devices we're reduced to use To keep out famine, and preserve our lives From day to day; the cold neglect of friends; The galling scorn, or more provoking pity Of an insulting worldâPossess'd of these, Plenty, content, and power might take their turn, And lofty pride bare its aspiring head At our approach, and once more bend before us. âA pleasing dream!â'Tis past; and now I wake More wretched by the happiness I've lost. For sure it was a happiness to think, Tho' but a moment, such a treasure mine. Nay, it was more than thoughtâI saw and touched The bright temptation, and I see it yetâ 'Tis hereâ'tis mineâI have it in possessionâ âMust I resign it? Must I give it back? Am I in love with misery and want?â To rob my self, and court so vast a loss?â âRetain it thenâBut how?âThere is a wayâ Why sinks my heart? Why does my blood run cold? Why am I thrill'd with horror?â'Tis not choice, But dire necessity suggests the thought. Enter old Wilmot. O. Wilm. The mind contented, with how little pains The wand'ring senses yield to soft repose, And die to gain new life? He's fallen asleep AlreadyâHappy man!âWhat dost thou think, My Agnes, of our unexpected guest? He seems to me a youth of great humanity: Just e're he closed his eyes, that swam in tears, He wrung my hand, and pressed it to his lips; And with a look, that pierced me to the soul, Begg'd me to comfort thee: AndâDost thou hear me?â What art thou gazing on?âFie, 'tis not wellâ This casket was deliver'd to you closed: Why have you open'd it? Shou'd this be known, How mean must we appear? Agn. And who shall know it? O. W. There is a kind of pride, a decent dignity Due to our selves; which, spite of our misfortunes, May be maintain'd, and cherish'd to the last. To live without reproach, and without leave To quit the world, shews sovereign contempt, And noble scorn of its relentless malice. Agn. Shews sovereign madness, and a scorn of sense. Pursue no farther this detested theme: I will not die, I will not leave the world For all that you can urge, until compell'd. O. Wilm. To chace a shadow, when the setting sun Is darting his last rays, were just as wise, As your anxiety for fleeting life, Now the last means for its support are failing: Were famine not as mortal as the sword, This warmth might be excusedâBut take thy choice: Die how you will, you shall not die alone. Agn. Nor live, I hope. O. Wilm. There is no fear of that. Agn. Then, we'll live both. O. Wilm. Strange folly! where's the means? Agn. The means are there; those jewelsâ O. Wilm. Ha!âTake heed: Perhaps thou dost but try me; yet take heedâ There's nought so monstrous but the mind of man In some conditions may be brought t'approve; Theft, sacrilege, treason, and parricide, When flatt'ring opportunity enticed, And desperation drove, have been committed By those who once wou'd start to hear them named. Agn. And add to these detested suicide, Which, by a crime much less, we may avoid. O. Wilm. Th'inhospitable murder of our guest!â How cou'dst thou form a thought so very tempting, So advantageous, so secure, and easy; And yet so cruel, and so full of horror? Agn. 'Tis less impiety, less against nature, To take another's life, than end our own. O. Wilm. It is no matter, whether this or that Be, in itself, the less or greater crime: Howe'er we may deceive our selves or others, We act from inclination, not by rule, Or none could act amissâAnd that all err, None but the conscious hypocrite denies. âO! what is man, his excellence and strength, When in an hour of trial and desertion, Reason, his noblest power, may be suborned To plead the cause of vile assassination. Agn. You're too severe: Reason may justly plead For her own preservation. O. Wilm. Rest contented: Whate'er resistance I may seem to make, I am betray'd within: My will's seduced, And my whole soul infected. The desire Of life returns, and brings with it a train Of appetites, that rage to be supplied. Whoever stands to parley with temptation, Does it to be o'ercome. Agn. Then nought remains, But the swift execution of a deed That is not to be thought on, or delay'd. We must dispatch him sleeping: Shou'd he wake, 'Twere madness to attempt it. O. Wilm. True, his strength Single is more, much more than ours united; So may his life, perhaps, as far exceed Ours in duration, shou'd he 'scape this snare. Gen'rous, unhappy man! O! what cou'd move thee To put thy life and fortune in the hands Of wretches mad with anguish! Agn. By what means? By stabbing, suffocation, or by strangling Shall we effect his death? O. Wilm. Why, what a fiend!â How cruel, how remorseless and impatient Have pride, and poverty made thee? Agn. Barbarous man! Whose wasteful riots ruin'd our estate, And drove our son, ere the first down had spread His rosy cheeks, spite of my sad presages, Earnest intreaties, agonies and tears, To seek his bread 'mongst strangers, and to perish In some remote, inhospitable landâ The loveliest youth, in person and in mind, That ever crown'd a groaning mother's pains! Where was thy pity, where thy patience then? Thou cruel husband! thou unnat'ral father! Thou most remorseless, most ungrateful man, To waste my fortune, rob me of my son; To drive me to despair, and then reproach me For being what thou'st made me. O. Wilm. Dry thy tears: I ought not to reproach thee. I confess That thou hast suffer'd much: So have we both. But chide no more: I'm wrought up to thy purpose. The poor, ill-fated, unsuspecting victim, Ere he reclined him on the fatal couch, From which he's ne'er to rise, took off the sash, And costly dagger that thou saw'st him wear; And thus, unthinking, furnish'd us with arms Against himself. Which shall I use? Agn. The sash. If you make use of that, I can assist. O. Wilm. No, 'Tis a dreadful office, and I'll spare Thy trembling hands the guiltâsteal to the door, And bring me word; if he be still asleep. [Ex. Ag. Or I'm deceiv'd, or he pronounc'd himself The happiest of mankind. Deluded wretch! Thy thoughts are perishing, thy youthful joys, Touch'd by the icy hand of grisly death, Are with'ring in their bloomâBut thought extinguist, He'll never know the loss, nor feel the bitter Pangs of disappointmentâThen I was wrong In counting him a wretch: To die well pleas'd, Is all the happiest of mankind can hope for. To be a wretch, is to survive the loss Of every joy, and even hope itself, As I have doneâWhy do I mourn him then? For, by the anguish of my tortur'd soul, He's to be envy'd, if compar'd with me. Enter Agnes with young Wilmot's dagger. Agn. The stranger Sleeps at present; but so restless His slumbers seem, they can't continue long. Come, come, dispatchâHere I've secur'd his dagger. O. Wilm. O Agnes! Agnes! if there be a hell, 'tis just We shou'd expect it. [Goes to take the dagger but lets it fall. Agn. Nay, for shame, shake off this panick, and be more your self. O. Wilm. What's to be done? On what had we determin'd? Agn. You're quite dismay'd. I'll do The deed my self. [Takes up the dagger. O. Wilm. Give me the fatal steel. 'Tis but a single murther, Necessity, impatience and despair, The three wide mouths, of that true Cerberus, Grim poverty, demandsâThey shall be stopp'd. Ambition, persecution, and revenge Devour their millions daily: And shall Iâ But follow me, and see how little cause You had to think there was the least remains Of manhood, pity, mercy, or remorse Left in this savage breast. [Going the wrong way. Agn. Where do you go? The street is that way. O. Wilm. True! I had forgot. Agn. Quite, quite confounded. O. Wilm. Well, I recover. âI shall find the way. [Exit. Agn. O softly! softly! The least noise undoes us. âStill I fear him: âNo now he seems determinedâO! that pause, That cowardly pause!âHis resolution failsâ 'Tis wisely done to lift your eyes to heaven; When did you pray before? I have no patienceâ How he surveys him? What a look was there?â How full of anguish, pity and remorseâ âHe'll never do itâStrike, or give it o'erâ âNo, he recoversâBut that trembling arm May miss its aim; and if he fails, we're lostâ 'Tis doneâO! no; he lives, he struggles yet. Y. Wilm. O! father! father! [In another room. Agn. Quick, repeat the blow. What pow'r shall I invoke to aid thee, Wilmot! âYet hold thy handâInconstant, wretched woman! What doth my heart recoil, and bleed with him Whose murther you contrivedâO Wilmot! Wilmot! Enter Charlot, Maria, Eustace, Randal and others. Char. What strange neglect! The doors are all unbarr'd, And not a living creature to be seen. Enter old Wilmot and Agnes. Char. Sir, we are come to give and to receive A thousand greetingsâHa! what can this mean? Why do you look with such amazement on us?â Are these your transports for your son's return?â Where is my Wilmot? Has he not been here?â Wou'd he defer your happiness so long, Or cou'd a habit so disguise your son, That you refus'd to own him? Agn. Heard you that? What prodigy of horror is disclosing, To render murther venial. O. Wilm. Prithee, peace: The miserable damn'd suspend their howling, And the swift orbs are fixt in deep attention. Y. Wilm. [Groans] Oh! oh! oh! Eust. Sure that deep groan came from the inner room. Rand. It did; and seem'd the voice of one expiring. Merciful heaven! where will these terrors end? That is the dagger my young master wore; And see, his father's hands are stained with blood. [Young Wilmot groans again. Eust. Another groan! Why do we stand to gaze On these dumb phantoms of despair and horror? Let us search farther: Randal, shew the way. Char. This is the third time those fantastick forms Have forc'd themselves upon my mental eyes, And sleeping gave me more than waking pains. O you eternal pow'rs! if all your mercy To wretched mortals be not quite extinguish'd, And terrors only guard your awful thrones, Remove this dreadful visionâLet me wake, Or sleep the sleep of death. [Exeunt Charlot, Maria, Eustace, Randal, &amp;c. O. Wilm. Sleep those who may; I know my lot is endless perturbation. Agn. Let life forsake the earth, and light the sun, And death and darkness bury in oblivion Mankind and all their deeds, that no posterity May ever rise to hear our horrid tale, Or view the grave of such detested parricides. O. Wilm. Curses and deprecations are in vain: The sun will shine, and all things have their course. When we, the curse and burthen of the earth, Shall be absorb'd, and mingled with its dust. Our guilt and desolation must be told, From age to age, to teach desponding mortals, How far beyond the reach of human thought Heaven, when incens'd, can punishâDie thou first. [Stabs Agnes. I dare not trust thy weakness. Agn. Ever kind, But most in this. O. Wilm. I will not long survive thee. Agn. Do not accuse thy erring mother, Wilmot! With too much rigour when we meet above. Rivers of tears, and ages spent in howling Cou'd ne'er express the anguish of my heart. To give thee life for life, and blood for blood, Is not enough. Had I ten thousand lives, I'd give them all to speak my penitence Deep, and sincere, and equal to my crime. [Dies. Enter Charlot led by Maria, and Randal; Eustace, and the rest. Char. Welcome, Despair! I'll never hope againâ Why have you forced me from my Wilmot's side? Let me returnâUnhand meâLet me die. Patience, that till this moment ne'er forsook me, Has took her flight; and my abandon'd mind, Rebellious to a lot so void of mercy And so unexpected, rages to madness. âO thou! who know'st our frame, who know'st these woes Are more than human fortitude can bear, O! take me, take me hence, e're I relapse; And in distraction, with unhallow'd tongue, Again arraign your mercyâ [Faints. Eust. Unhappy maid! This strange event my strength Can scarce support; no wonder thine should fail. âHow shall I vent my grief? O Wilmot! Wilmot! Thou truest lover, and thou best of friends, Are these the fruits of all thy anxious cares For thy ungrateful parents?âCruel fiends! To use thee thus!âTo recompense with death Thy most unequall'd duty and affection! O. Wilm. What whining fool art thou, who would'st usurp My sovereign right of grief?âWas he thy son?â Say! Canst thou shew thy hands reeking with blood, That flow'd, thro' purer channels, from thy loins? Eust. Forbid it heaven! that I should know such Guilt: Yet his sad fate demands commiseration. O. Wilm. Compute the sands that bound the spacious ocean, And swell their number with a single grain; Increase the noise of thunder with thy voice; Or when the raging wind lays nature waste, Assist the tempest with thy feeble breath; Add water to the sea, and fire to Etna; But name not thy faint sorrow with the anguish Of a curst wretch who only hopes for this [Stabbing himself. To change the scene, but not relieve his pain. Rand. A dreadful instance of the last remorse! May all your woes end here. O. Wilm. O would they end A thousand ages hence, I then should suffer Much less than I deserve. Yet let me say, You'll do but justice, to inform the world, This horrid deed, that punishes itself, Was not intended as he was our son; For that we knew not, 'till it was too late. Proud and impatient under our afflictions, While heaven was labouring to make us happy, We brought this dreadful ruin on ourselves. Mankind may learnâbutâoh!â [Dies. Rand. The most will not: Let us at least be wiser, nor complain Of heaven's mysterious ways, and awful reign: By our bold censures we invade his throne Who made mankind, and governs but his own: Tho' youthful Wilmot's sun be set e're noon, The ripe in virtue never die too soon.
