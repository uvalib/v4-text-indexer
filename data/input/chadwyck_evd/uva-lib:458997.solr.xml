      <field name="fulltext">TO THE CANDID READER. A small part of this Subject, many years since had drop'd from my pen: But looking at some opportunities upon the Argument, I thought some things more considerable might be deduced; and applying my self further, at times of recess, I felt it grow and multiply under my imagination: Nor left I it then (the matter being so pregnant in it self) till I form'd it into such limbs and proportions as you now see it. Modesty after this, invited me to cover it, and to cut off many impertinences, and purge some humour, that sate, I confess, unhandsomely upon it. What is now presented, I hope will appear a genuine and unforc'd Moral, which though drest in Drammatique Ornament, may not displease, in the reading, persons of ingenuity, such whose nature is not to create prejudice, where they intend a recreation. And in the confidence of that, I do not repent the superstructures I have made, my pains, nor expences that have attended to bring it to this. It is now publique to satisfie the importunity of friends, I will onely adde, it is like to be the last, for in my resolve, nothing of this nature shall after this, engage either my pen or invention. The reason why I make no particular Dedication to any Friend, is, because I aim my general respect to all, whose favours and civilities have oblig'd me. At this none will be offended, where none hath the precedence: And to conclude with the most serious truth, I know not any, that love me so little, whom the payment of my so mean addresses would satisfie, as to clear me upon the account of his friendship. Let this suffice at present from him, that is Your Servant, James Shirley.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. Enter Alworth and Phantasm. Alw. Tis not far off, 'Ile aske this Gentleman. Can you instruct me, sir, where the great Lady Aurelia Mammon lives? Pha. Yes sir, I can. Alw. Pray do me the civility. Pha. Have you Affaires with her, my friend in black? Alw. Have you Relation to the Lady, Sir? Pha. She ownes me A Gentleman-usher, with your pardon Sir, Are not you inclining to a Scholar? Alw. I have spent time i'th Academy. Pha. The Academy? Another beggar, I did think so by your serious face, your habit Had almost cosened me, and your hair, they are Of the more Court edition, this is A beggar of the upper forme of Learning, Your business with my Lady, Alw. If you please To prepare my accessâ Pha. 'Tis to no purpose, My Lady keeps no Library, no food For booke-worms, I can assure you that. Learning is dangerous in our Family, She wo'not keep a Secretary for fear Of the infection. Alw. Does she keep no foole? Pha. Yes, yes, and knaves; Alw. I thought so, In which classe is your name, I beseech you? Pha. We enjoy equal priviledges, indeed the knave Makes somewhat more on's office, but my Lady Is not so nice, so we can bring Certificates That we are sound, and free from the infection Of book's, or can lay down our understandings, And part with that unnecessary stuffing I'th head, (you know my meaning) or renounce The impious use of humane art and knowledge, We are in a capacity of imployment; Perhaps you may, on these terms be admitted With your Philosophy, and things about you, To keep her horse, de'e observe? Alw. A faire preferment! Pha. The fittest here for men of art, or if You can keep counsell and negotiate handsomely The amorous affair of flesh and blood; (There you may exercise your parts of Rhetorique.) How lies your learning that way? 'tis an office Many grave persons have submitted to, And found it a smooth path to court preferment, But she is here, I'le leave you to your fortune. Enter Aurelia Mammon. Mam. With me, your business? Alw. The Lady Honoria, Madam, by me humbly Presents her service, and this paper to Your Ladyship. Mam. The Lady Honour? 'tis Some borrowing letter. Alw. This is not civill. Mam. I am so haunted with this mendicant Nobility at every ebbe of fortune, I must be troubled with Epistles from e'm. What's here?âyou are a Scholar. Alw. I have studied the artes, Mam. Your Lady writes as much, and would commend you To my inployment, but I want no Chaplain. Alw. If you did, I cannot flatter, Madam. Mam. I have known wiser men converted by Preferment. Alw. They were things that had no Soules, Or use of that bright Entelecheia Which separates them from beasts. Mam. I did expect Hard words, and do commend the pure discretion Of your most learned tribe, that think themselves Brave fellowes, when they talk Greeke to a Lady; Next to the Goth and Vandall, you shall carry The bable from Mankind, pray tell your Lady, Learning is out of fashion in my Family, Alw. Why should you be an Enemy to Arts? The Lamps we wast, and watches, that consume Our strength in noble studies, are ill paid With this disdain, your smile would make us happy, And with your golden beame strike new day Through learnings universe. Mam. You but loose your time, I know you are writing some prodigious volume In praise of hunger, and immortall beggery. This may in time advance you to a Pedant, To whip the Town-top's, or gelded Vicaridge, Some forty Markes per annum, and a Chamber-maid Commended by your Patron. Alw. Y'are not worth My anger, I should elseâ Mam. What my sweet Satyre? Alw. Present your Ladyship with a glasse, a true one, Should turne you wild to see your owne deformity. Mam. I prethee raile, now for a stormeâ Alw. I wo'not loose my temper on such a trifle. Exit. Enter Fulbanke and Maslin. Mam. But here are two come timely, to disperse All clowdy thoughts, my diligent daily waiters. Ful. Now Poetry be my speed! my noblest mistriss. Mam. What have you there, dear Mr. Fulbanke? Ful. Lines, that are prou'd to express your beauty? Madam. Mam. Bless me! turn'd Poet? I must tell you Servant, Nothing in nature is more killing to me. Ful. Umh! I see my Lady Mammon is no wit. Do'e think I made e'm? I have an Estate, Madam. Mam. I know you have fin'd for Alderman. Ful. They were a foolish Scholars o'the Town, And I made my address to be confirm'd In your opinion, they were wretched things, And like the starv'd composer. The nine Muses I have read, Madam, in a Learned Author, Were but a knot of travailing, tawny gipsies That liv'd by country canting, and old Songs, And picking wormes out of fooles fingers, which Was palmistry forsooth, and for Apollo Whom they call'd Father, a poor silly Piper, That kep't a thatch'd house upon Cuckolds Hill, Not far from Helicon, or old Bride-well, Where he sold switches, till his hut was burn'd One night by a tinkers nose, that lay in straw there; And he, for losse of this poor tenement, Ran mad, from whence came all the mighty stir, Of that, which we now call Poetick fury. Mam. 'Tis very likely. Mas. Madam, be your leave, I am a country-man, what should a man lye for? I ken no Colledge learning, but I have Been whip'd for latin in my dayes, that have I; And have heard talke of the Philosophers stone; Although I weare not velvet like his worship, My heart's imbroyder'd with love and I Defie the man that thinkes me insufficient To do, whats fitting to be done between You and I Madam, as the best what lack you Finical-fartical-citt within the walls. Ful. Take heed how you provoke me. Mas. I'le provoke any man living, in the way of Love. Enter Phantasme. Mam. Did all the Ladies sleep well? Pha. Yes and their Monkeys Madam, and have all Their severall thanks, and services remembred To your Ladishipâbut Madamâ Exit Mam. and Phan Ful. She has left us. I'le find a time to make you sensibleâ Mas. Me sensible? I defy thee. Ful. Be not rampant, and thank Heaven We are not arm'd. Mas. I scorne it. Ful. Dar'st thou meet me? Mas. Yes, the next day after Simon and Jude I dare, when all your liveries go a feasting By water with your gally foist and pot-guns, And Canvas Whales to Westminster; I am not Affear'd of your green Robin-hoods, that fright With fiery club your pitifull Spectators That take pains to be stifled, and adore The Wolves and Camels of your company. Next whom the children ride, who innocent things, What with the Gyants, and the Squibs and eating Too many sugar-plumms, take occasion to Perfume their Pageants, which your Senators Ride after in full scent. Ful. Thou horrid Lumpe Of leather, course wooll, ignorance and husbandry, Most pitifully compounded, thou that Hast liv'd so long a dunghill, till the weeds Had over-grown thee, and but ten yards off, Cosen'd a horse that come to graze upon thee, Thou miserable thing, that wert begot By the whole Town, thou dar'st call no man Father, Found in a hedge, but bred up in a stable, Wherewith the horse thou did'st divide the bean's, Dung like the beast, and wert as often curried. Thus bred, at one and twenty thou wer't able To write a legible Sheeps mark in tarre, And read thy own capitall letter, like a gallows In a Cows buttock. Mas. Suffer this? Ful. And more: Fortune conspiring with thy own ill nature, That durst be damn'd for Money, made thee rich, And then the Countreys curses fatten'd thee, Time, and thy sordid sins made thee at last High-Constable, and now thou hast the impudenceâ Mas. Thou liest. Maslin strikes Fulbank Enter Phantasme with two Swords. Pha. Fear not me Gentlemen, I am your friend, A friend to both your honours; here, be noble You have a just cause, and a gallant Mistriss Persons of your quality, to fight thus For bloody noses, too't like Gentlemen, And draw blood handsomely, he that gets the victory Shall ha my Lady, and a pardon, though It cost her half a Million, so I leave you. Here will I stay, and observe both their valours. Ful. We are betraid. Obscure Mas. I do not like these tooles. Ful. It is not for my credit to be kill'd, If he have but the courage to advance, I am no Merchant-taylor of this World, And yet he lookes less rampant. Sirrah Maslinâ Mas. I were best deliver up my cold iron, here. Ful. He does approach. Mas. And yet I wo'not. Fulbanke. I am of thy opinion, we are both Betraid; for my owne part, although I carry No flesh that feares a sword; yet I do not Affect to have devices put upon me. Ful. Tis something thou hast said; this may be a plot; Some third man has projected by our ruines To make his path smooth to my Lady Mammon; And thus her Squire promotes it. Mas. A conspiracy! I read it in the rascals face, too't quotha Like Gentlemen? no, they sha'not laugh at me. And my Lady had a mind to ha my throat cut, She shall excuse me. Ful. To my wishes! but I am not satisfied, We can without some blood come off with honour, You know th'affront was mine, and though I wod not Have my revenge writ in too deep a crimson, Yet something must be done, it will be publick, And we may still be laugh'd at. Mas. Thou saist right, Things cannot well be clear'd without some blood. I have consider'd, and you shall be satisfied, Ful. So, I have made fine worke, the Bore will fight now. Mas. The credit of a wound will serve, thus thenâ Ful. Stay, I have a device will bring us both off. Why may not we consent to give each other A careless wound in the leg, or arme, and so March off with honour? Mas. This knack was in my very thoughts, 'tis Ex'lent. Ful. But since I nam'd it first, 'tis my invention, And I will strike the first blow, Mas. hang't, I pass not, But gently then, a scratch ith arme, or hands Enough, a small thing does it, gently, oh! Thou hast cut of my Sword hand, this is fowle play, I cannot hold my toole now. Ful. But stoope to reach it, I'l cut thy head off, Ith field we must Use all advantages. This weapon's mine too. Farewell, and say I have used thee honourably. Enter Phantasme. Pha. Ha. ha. ha. are you hurt Sir? I see the Alderman has outwitted you. Let me see, ha? a scratch, a very scratch; Beare up, there may be wayes to your revenge, Leave not your applications to my Lady. He counsells this, that will assist youâbut I ever thought your habit much beneath The person that should court so great a Lady. It smells too much ot'h teame, I know y'are rich. Aire, aire your gold, and make your body clinkant, The rest commit to fate, and me, consult Your Taylor. Mas. And my Chirurgeon; Sir I thanke you. Pha. You do not know, how I am contriving for you. Mas. That very word has cur'd me. I'le about it. Exit. Pha. So, when ther's no other mischief to be done, Let them go on, and love my Lady Mammon; I'le assist one, in hope the t'other may Go hang himself, and then it will be hard To judge, which of the two has the better fortune. Exit. Enter Honoria between Alamode and Collonell. Ala. Bless me but with one smile, if you did know With what devotion my Soul lookes on you, How next to my Religion I have plac'd, If not above it,) your diviner beautyâ Hon. Your name is Alamode, a Courtier. Aba. 'Tis sweetned by Honoria's breath, Col. I have No stock of perfum'd words to court you, Madam, Can you affect a man? A souldier? When I have march'd up to a breach, which look'd Like Hell with all his sulphurous flames about it; My heart was fixt on honour, and I tooke From gaping wounds the fleeting Soules about me Into my owne, and fought with all their spirits; The mangled bodies that I trod upon, (For now the dead had buried all the Earth) Gave me addition to Heaven, where in, My strong imagination I saw Thee from thy Chariot dropping down a Garland. Hon. You are a Colonel. Col. I profess a souldier Madam. Hon. It appears a bold one; art thou come Alworth. Enter Alworth. What said the Lady Mammon? Ala. One that has some relation to her person. They call him Alworth, and I have observ'd She lookes on him with favour above a Servant, He has not the impudence to court his Lady Hon. So peremptory? what a strange monster wealth is? I have but made a tryall of her friendship, And had no meaning thou should'st leave me Alworth, Depend upon my care, I know your parts; And shall not be forgetfull of their merit. But thou art come most seasonable to relieve me. Ala. I do not like their whispering. Alw. If you please, Madam, to absent your self, Leave me to the excuse. Hon. Do so, dear Alworth. Alw. I am happy when you command me service. Hon. Be confident, I keep a silent register of all, And shall reward them. Alw, Your own vertues guide you. Exit Hon. Col. My Lady's gone. Alw. But has commanded me to let you know Her resolution, she hath found you both Ambitious of honour, both deserving, And such an equall furniture of merit, She has no art to reconcile her thoughts Into one fortunate choice. Ala. 'Tis very strange. Alw. The Gordian, which great Alexander could not By subtilty dissolve, his sword untwisted; I use her own words, Gentlemen, you may Inferre, that you must either quit your courtship, Or by your selves agree, who best deserves her, And dare do most to merit such a mistriss. Ala. How, best deserves her? Col. And dare do most, Alw. I should interpret this to fight for Honour. But you can best expound, and so I leave you. Exit. Col. What sayes my perfum'd Alamode to this? Will not a sword quite spoile your sattin Doublet, And let in too much aire? your lips and language Bath'd in the oyle of Gossamine will not carry her, You have worne a sword thus long, to shew the hilt, Now let the blade appear. Ala. It shall. I have yet No ague, I can looke upon your buffe, And punto beard, yet call for no strong-water, I am no Tavern gull, that want protection, Whom you with oathes do mortifie and sweare Into the payment of your ten pound surfeits; Upon whole credit you weare belt and feather, Top and Top-gallant. Go to your Landabâ It'h new Brothell, she's a handsome leverett, If she deny free quarter, tear her trinkets, Make Cullice of the Matron, yet be friends Before the Constable come in, and runne Ot'h ticket for the dear disease. Col. Go on sir. I will have patience three minutes longer, To hear thy scurrile wit, and then correct it. Ala. Answer but one coole question, if Honoria Should possibly descend to think well of thee, And by some philtre should be brought to love thee. What Jointure could we make, what's the per annum? Col. Have you done yet? Ala. 'Tis not impossible, You may have a Catalogue of Town's and Leaguers, The Names of Bridges broken down, your nose In time may keep them company in Landschape. You will tell of Bulworkes, Barricado, Fort's. Of outworkes, half moones, spurres, and parrapets Of turnepikes, flankers, Cats and Counter-scarfs, These things will hardly pawn with Jew or Christian: But i'le come closer to you, you may have In ready wounds some twenty, i'le admit, And in diseases can assure her forty; This wo'not do, she cannot eate a knapsack, Or carry baggage, lye in your foule hutt, And rost the pullen, for whose pretious theft, You and the gibbet fear to be acquainted. If you return into your wholsome Countrey, Upon your honourable wooden legges, The houses of Correction have but thinn Accommodations, nor the Hospitalls. Col. It does appear by all this impudence, And little wit pilfer'd, and put together, You do not know me. Ala. Cry your mercie, Sir. You are a great Field-officer, are past These petty things, but if these times preserve Their smooth complexion, it wo'not be Ten hundred thousand pistols to a stiver, But you may run this gantlope once agen. Col. You imagine you have stung me now, and that I think my self concern'd in ths keen character? I tell thee (wretched thing,) thou doest not reach A Souldier, 'tis a name, three Heavens above Thy Soule to understand, and 'twere a sin Would lessen our own worth, to make thee know it. You are a Courtier. Ala. Very good. Col. Nay rather. A very impious one, you shall confess it, Or I will cut your throat, this is no canting. Ala. Very fine. Col. Nay we know you are a fine Gentleman, A Taffata-sattin-plush-embroydered- Lac'd-scarlet-tissue-cloath-a-bodkin devill; Pride is thy meat and drink, thy Library, And thy Religion, thy new clothes only Bring thee to Church, where thou dost muster, all The fashions, and the trinkets, to the last New button, upon which thy conscience sits, And as the devill guides it, dost condemne, Or save the people, that done, not the window's Scape thee, for thou woot quarrell with the pictures, And find fault with the Apostles, for not having A better Taylor, these Sir are your vertues, Your high, and holiday devotions. What moral vices follow in the weeke, Is best known to the devill, your close friend, That keeps the Catalogue, yet one touch of them; Thy lust has no bounds, when thy blood's a fire, Thou leap'st all like a Satyre, without difference Of kindred, or acquaintance; and were those But summon'd, whom thy body hath infected, They would stuffe an Hospital, and out-stinke the Pest-house. Ala. And yet I walke upon these poor supporters. Col. How long the Chirurgeon knowes. Ala. These all my faults? Col. No, those are but thy Peccadillioes, Thy malice is behind, thou woot not take a bribe To undo a Nation, sell thy Countrey men To as many persecutions, as the devill Or Dutch men had invented at Amboyna; With all this stock of villany, thou hast An impudenceâ Ala. I'le heare no more, Col. A little i'le intreat you, all is but A preface to your beating, which must follow, Your tribe will beare it. Ala. Then have at you Sir. They make a Pass. Col. Y'are very nimble Courtier. Ala. As you see. Col. Good Mounsieur Quicksilver, You may be fixt. Ala. And your arrear's be paid. Another Pass, Alamo down and disarm'd. Col. What think you now? Ala. It is your fortune Sir. Col. Y'are at my mercie, aske your life? Ala. I scorne it. Col. I'le kill you then. Ala. A boy may do as much At this advantage. Col. Will you not aske your life? Ala. No 'tis not worth it. Col. And't be not worth your asking, 'tis not Worth My taking at this posture, there's your weapon, Rise, use it agen. Ala. It shall be thus to render it. Though I was not so base to beg my life, Yet since you have given it me, I scorne to imploy Against one that was the master on't. Col. This is gallantry. Ala. You taught it first. Col. In spight of all the Widdowes in the World We will be friends. Ala. I meet it Colonel. Col. And for the Lady Mammonâ Ala. Wee'l take our chance. Col. A match, now let us to th'Tavern.

Nay nay, be covered, thou art my best friend. Pha. It was but Justice to advance your merit With all the Retorick I had, for where In prudence, could my Lady Mammon place Her self with more advantage to her fame? A widdow of a thousand pound per annum Jointure With some few present bagges of musty Gold, Old Plate, and hungry houshold-stuff would serve The Countrey well enough. Ful. Excellent Phantasme Pha. Where the report of building a Free-school, And now and then an alme-house for old women, With five teeth and a half among sixteen, Would make a mighty noise, and the poor hinds Wonder, there's so much money left in nature. The City is her only sphere of glory. Ful. Right, very right. Pha. Here My Lady Mammon. (Yours now as things are ordered) Ful. Good. Pha. May have high and noble waies to employ her treasures. Do things above the vulgar admiration, Surround the City with a wall of Silver, Transmute dull Leaden-hall to Gold, rebuild The great Cathedrall of St. Pauls with Porphyrie And clap so bright a spire upon't, shall make The Sea-man afar off wonder what new And never setting starre, Heaven hath created To make the day eternall in this Island. Ful. My own Phantasme. Pha. There is no end, Sir, of her wealth, if you Have but the patience to spend, you may Out-do the Roman Luxuries. Ful. I'l give thee my Gold-chain. Pha. O'h no, it may do you better service, Sir, Bout your own neck hereafter; for all this Infinite Treasure that she brings you, Sir, What Joynture do you make her? You are mortall. Ful. I ha thought of that, I will secure my whole Estate upon her? Beside her own, I have no kindred, that I care for, they are poor, and as my pride, While I am living, will not look upon e'm, At death, it will be wisdom to forget them. Pha. It would endeare my Lady much, if you Surprize her with this act, before she think on't. I would have you do things gallantlyâ Ful. You shall Give the direction to my Counsell; Pha. His name. Ful. A very honest able eminent person, One Mr. Traverse, see it done your self. Phan. My Lady will take it well, without all doubt, Sir. Ful. But shall I engage your troubleâ Pha. 'Tis an honour; I'l give him order to dispatch all presently. He is a very honest man you say. Ful. He's right, I know him intus &amp; in Cute. Pha. My Lady, Sir, leave things to me. Enter Mammon. Ful. My most divine Aurelia! Mam. Dear Mr. Fulbanke, I have no happiness but in your presence, When shall the worke be perfect? Ful. I was considering, It would become the glory of my Bride, To have some state, and triumph at our marriage, I know the City will expect we should Accept some entertainment, perhaps Pageants, And speeches to congratulate our Nuptial. Mam. 'Twill please me much. Pha. There may be prejudice in these delay's, Ful. Oh Sir, the state is all; what thinks you Ladyship? We will have tilting too, and feats of Chivalry At Court where I'l defend my Aurelia Princess, In the guilt armour that I mustered in, And the rich saddle of my owne perfuming, I'l have my squires, my plumes, and my devices, And with my lance encounter the whole mirrour Of Knight-hood, and compell the forreign Princes To hang up all the Tables of their Mistrisses As Trophee's to my most victorious Mammon. Pha. Without some cure he will be mad immediately. Enter Alamode, reading a Letter, a Servant waits. Ala. Present my humblest service to Honoria, Say I am all obedience to her commands, Were I in Heaven, this invitation Would have the power to draw me thence, I kiss Her fairest hand, this for your favour, gives him money. Mr. Fulbanke, Ful. Please you to know my Lady Sir? Ala. If I mistake not the Lady Aurelia; Widdow to the late high Treasurer, Sir Omnipotent Mammon. Salutes her? But are you Master of this rich Peru? Ful. She will please to owne me, ha? Mam. It is but Justice. Ala. A thousand streams of joy flow in your bosoms, I'l take some fortunate hour to visit you, And with an humble lip print my devotions On your white hand. Mam. You'l do me an honour sir. Ala. Some high affairs compell this rude departure, But you have mercy to excuse your servant. Exit. Ful. VVhat heaps of words some men have got together To signifie nothing? Pha. How do you like this Gentleman? Ful. These Courtiers are another sort of flesh-flies, That haunt our City dames, but we must winke, Or loose our Chatter? Pha. Bless the Body Politick. Enter Maslin in rich Cloths, but Antick. Mas. By your leave Gentlemen. Ful. VVhat Pageant's this? Mas. VVhere De'e think I have been, Madam? Mas. At the Brokers. Mas. At the Exchange by these silke-stockings, Mr. Usherâa word to the wise, If they will fit your rowling-pin, they'r paid for; Perhaps the wages you receive in your Relation to my Lady, wo'not find you Convenient vanities. Now I'me for you Madam. Mam. In good time. Mas. I wanted but your hand, I could ha fitted you with gloves, but here are Some trifles for the finger, you must weare This Diamond, and this Ruby, Mam. De'e understand VVhat you do sir? Mas. And here's a casting Net of Pearl. Mam. A Carkanet? these will deserveâ Mas. Tell not me of desert, I hate it perfectly, Hang toyes and yellow rubbish that paid for e'm, How De'e like my clothes? Ful. Sir I am concern'd to thank you for these favours. Mas. You? prethee away, I ha nothing to say to thee? Ful. We have no other gratitude sweet-heart, But to invite him to our wedding. Mas. Wedding? Phantasme. Pha. And you had come but half an hour sooner, This very shape had don't. Mas. Do not, do not make me mad too soone. Ful. You have been very bountifull, and we pray Your noble presence at our Festivall, Which we have deferr'd to be attended with Some Triumph, such as may become the City, And my dear Ladies honour, is't not so, My America? look how the oyster gapes. Leave him to chew his Countrey cud, come Madam. Exeunt. Pha. Sir I confess.â Mas. And be hang'd, I am undone, and I could cry now. Pha. Sir, You have been at a great charge to go without her, Such rings, and Carknet, beside the cost Of this fine habit? for your bounty, Sir, Bestowed on me, the unworthiest of your Servants, I have a gratitude, if you please to accept it. Mas. What is't? a halter or a knife to cure me, Or a comfortable poison? Pha. 'Tis the first You nam'd, a most convenient, neatly twisted Halter, for I do see your inclinations, And shall commend your fortidude, beside 'Twill shew a brave contempt upon their scorns. And who know's, how the example, Sir, may spread To cure some other mad men that love widdows. You have my judgement and the cord for nothing, Lose not the nick of the next beam you come at, No way like this to be High-Constable. Mas. Here, take my clothes; I will be mad, and hang My self immediately;âand yet I will consider, Till the ayre be a little warmer; when I have Cut Fulbanks throat, 'tis but a hanging afterwards. 'Tis good to be malicious, and wise; Some notable revenge would be worth all My cost, and then a sico for the Devill. Exit. Enter Alworth and Alamode, Alw. Please you to have a little patience I shall acquaint my Lady that y'are come, Sir. Ala. Before you go, dear Sir, I know your prudence And neere imployment with my Lady, has Endeer'd you to partake some of her Counsells; You shall obliege a very humble Servant, To let me know how she affects, you reach My meaning, by what motive am I sent for? Alw. My Lady keeps the key of her own Cabinet, But if you'l have my Judgement on the scheme, I think my Lady will this day determine Her choice, I encline the rather to this Judgement, Because the Colonell is sent for too. My attendance is expected, Sir, your pardon. Ala. Ha musick. A song within praise of a Courtier. I like this well Enter Colonell and Alworth. Alw. My Lady will appear presently, I'l give her knowledge, if you please. Col. Your favour, Sir, You are learned beyond books, what's your opinion Of my Lady, in relation to things at present? What do you think of me? Alw. My thoughts are much Too narrow to conclude your worth, which left An object for Divine Honoria's wisdom, Must only take from her, a worthy character And just reward. A song in praise of a Soldier. Col. I like this preface. Ala. My noble Colonell, thy Servant. Enter Honoria attended, a Table set forth, with a Cabinet upon it. Hon. Excuse the trouble that I give you Gentlemen, Y'are welcome, and thus knit into a freindship, Your persons have more grace, and shine upon e'm: Some chairs, pray sit. I see you both preserve Your fair respects to honour, and I have After some pause, and serious dispute Within my self, collected now at last, Upon whose person to repose my self, My fortune, and my same, and since but one (Where many may deserve) can weare the Garland The loser must content himself with his fate, And wait a kinder providence. Col. 'Tis but Justice. She takes a wreath of Bayes from the Cabinet. Hon. This wreath of bayes, embleme of victory, Must crowne his head to whom I fall a Conquest, Forgive the Ceremony. Col. Oh 'tis very pleasing, Ala. I like it well, Madam, and commend your fancy. Hon. You, Sir, were bred up in the Schoole of honour, The Court, this may not unbecome your Temples, Wise Courtiers are the Jewels of a Crown, The Columnes and the ornaments of state, Fitted with parts; and piety to act: They serve the Power for Justice, not themselves; Their Faith the Cabinet, in which is laid The Princes safety, and the Nations peace, The Oracles, and the mysteries of Empire; Men borne above the sordid guilt of avarice, Free as the mountain aire, and calme as mercy. Borne without Eyes, when the poor man complains Against the great oppressor, without hands, To take the bloudy price of mans undoing, But keeping at each sense a Court of Guard, Draws fear from Love, and teaches good by example. She puts the Wreath upon the Colonell. Ala. Divine Honoria. Hon. You must give me leave, To try, how it becomes his brow; me thinks VVith the same grace, it dwells upon his head, Does he not look like mighty Julius now, When he returned triumphant from the Gaules, Or bringing home the wealthy spoiles of Egypt, Pontus, and Africa? allow him but The same commands, and men to fight, why may not His Valour equall what is fam'd in story, Atchiev'd by the great souls of Rome, and Carthage? A soldier merits first to be called man, By whom not only Courts but Kingdoms flourish, Unto whose severall offices, the VVorld Owes all the great and glorious names of honour. How would the age grow rusty, and the soule Of Common-wealths corrupt with ease, and surfeits, Should not the sword call e'm to exercise, And sweat out their unmanly Luxuries, By acting things worth envy, even of Princes. The honour of the Gowne without his sword, VVill run it self into contempt, and Laws Are not good made, but while the sword secures e'm. The Court must weare no silke, nor the prowd City Make the Sea groane with burden of her wealth, Did not the active soldier, with expence Of his dear blood, expose himself abroad, Their convoy, and security at home. Col. I am transported. Hon. Give me the same favour To let me looke a little on this Chaplet, To which I have annexed my self a Labell. Me thinks the Trifle looks, as it had lost, Some Verdure since I took it from your heads, The Courtier, and the Soldier both inviting In such a high degree of merit, hinders The progress I should make, but pardon me, I shall soone quit the Labarynth. Col. What's the meaning? Hon. I would you were not two, or that one had Less of desert, when you are both in ballance, Have you no art, Gentlemen, to contract Your selves into one person? Ala. 'Tis not possible. Hon. Think you so? it is worth the experiment, Come hither Alworth. Alw. Madam. Hon. Nay come nearer, This is a Scholar, Gentlemen, and the cloud He weares, remov'd, for he's no more a Servant, May bring him into a civill competition: Me thinks it fits him, your opinions? Col. We are in a fair way to be ridiculous, what think you? Chiaus'd by a Scholar? Ala. Are you in earnest Madam? Hon. I repent not The placing of it there, in him do meet The Courtier and the Soldier, at least He's not without the best capacity Of both your worths, when they have brightest lustre Ala. There is no remedy. Would I had Mammon. Hon. Gentlemen stay, &amp; hear the Scholars character. Col. No thank you Madam, we have heard too much. Fortune has given you Lawrell, and us willow. May your wreath flourish, Sir? Exeunt. Ala. Soule of my muse! what? active unknown fire Already doth thy Delphick wreath inspire? O'th suddain how my faculties swell high, And I am all a powerfull Prophecie. Sleep ye dull CÃ¦sars, Rome will boast in vain Your glorious Triumphs, one is in my brain Great, as all theirs, and circled with thy bayes, My thoughts take Empire ore all Land, and Seas? Proof against all the Planets, and the stroke Of Thunder, I rise up Augustus Oake, Within my guard of Lawrell, and made free From age, look fresh still, as my Daphnean tree: My fancy's narrow yet, till I create For thee another World, and in a state As free as innocence, shame all Poets wit, To climb no higher than Elizium yet; Where the pale Lovers meet, and teach the groves To sigh, and sing bold legends of their Loves. We will have other flights, and tast such things Are only fit for sainted Queens and Kings. All that was Earth falls of, my spirits free, I have nothing left now, but my Soule and thee. Honoria takes off the Wreath. Hon. VVhat means this Extasie? this was not meant, Unless you use my favours with less insolence, I can repent, and frowne e'm back to nothing. Have you forgot your distance? can a smile And this green trifle forfeit your discretion, Or make me less, than when you were my Servant. I look you should be humble still, Alw. Good Heaven! What unexpected, most prodigious cloud, With his black wings, hath in a minute veild The brightest day, that ever smil'd upon me? Did not you place it here? Hon. It is confest, As an encouragement to your vertue, Sir, No Conquest of Honoria, yet you triumph, And make me blush as I had courted you. Al. O do not charge my thoughts with such a stain, This might deserve your anger, and vouchsafe me The boldness to say Madam, if you punish My hasty application of your favours, You gave me the encouragement to be guilty. It is a tyrany to cherish Servants, And punish their obedience. Hon. But when flattered by Pride, which darkes the soule, you challenge And measure the reward by your own fancy, You loose the noblest recompence of service, And merit but the hire of common duties; 'Tis possible, that Gold may satisfie My debt to your imployment. Alw. Till this minute I was not lost, but having heard this, Madam, You must do something like a miracle To save me now;âI dare contemne your Gold, And am compell'd to aske your Justice, what Action since I had reference to honour, Look'd with a mercenary staine upon it? Gold is a pay for soules of darke complexion. I served you for your self, and since I'm thought Beneath the merit of your smile, I'l make My self above the price of sordid contracts, For I can with as much ease despise your wealth, As I can shift the ayre, I take my leave, And can pray for you in a Wilderness. Ho. Come back, this minute every cloud is vanish'd That did present displeasing formes: I find Thy soule is pure, forgive this Triall, thou hast Deserved me best. Alw. I dare not understand you now. Hon. The language is not hard. Alw. I want a name, to call this blessing by, Then I may kiss your hand, and may I not, Madam approach your lip, and be forgiven? Now I begin to doubt. Hon. My Faith? Alw. That I am not awake, or if I be That I am short-liv'd, and must soone dissolve Under this storme of happiness; ha? 'tis come And I have lost my courage o'the suddain. faints. Your pardon Madam, something gathers here That wo'd surprize my heart. I am asham'd on't. Enter Ser. Hon. Who waits, contribute your best help to his Support, convey him gently to his chamber, Run for Phisitians, thy good genius guard thee. Alw. I am not Worth your fears. Hon. And worth my love? Alw. That very word should cure me, Hon I have been Too much, I fear unkind, to both our dangers. Exeunt.</field>

Stay if he takes this prize, what shall I have For all my expences! that's considerable; Oh, I shall have revenge he says; the widdow Were much the better, but we must be rul'd By our learned Counsell. Mam. You have order from A Gentleman of the City, Mr. Fulbanke, To draw up writings, sirâ Tra. A Joynture Madam. But I receiv'd a Countermand. Mam. From whom? Tra. From providence that would not suffer such An excellent Lady to be lost, and thrown Among the City rubbish. Mam, Do you know Mr. Fulbanke Sir? Tra. As much, as I do wonder at his impudence, And sawcy ambition with his mean deserts To look at such a blessing; your fortunes Are worth your preservation, and a man Whose art, and serious knowledge in the VVorld May fence it in from a rapine, and that greater Enemy to an Estates profusion. Excuse my plainess Madam. Mam. 'Tis a Truth. Tra. Can you vouchsafe your smile upon a Servant, To whose faith and care you safely may commit A Treasure of more value than the World, Your self; in me behold him Madam, one That would devote his soule a Sacrifice To be for ever burning in those beams, There is no Law, but in your breast, your lips, Preserve the Nations Oracle. Mam. This Language Doth tast too much of Poetry, take heed, Sir. Tra. If this dislike you Madam, I can court you In a more legall way, and in the name Of Love and Law arrest you, thus Embraces her. Mam. Arrest me? Tra. And hold you fast imprisoned in my arms, Without or baile or maineprize. Mam. This does well. Tra. I can do better yet, and put in such A declaration, Madam, as shall startle Your merriest blood Mam. I may put in my answer. Tra. Then comes my replication, to which You may rejoyne, Currat Lex. shall we? Joyne issue presently? Mam. He'l have her se defendendo. Enter Phantasme and Fulbanke: Pha. What do you think of this, Sir? Ful. They are very familiar. Mas. 'Tis he, the very he, come as my heart Could wish to his vexation. Pha. Is this the honest Gentleman You trusted, Sir; Tra. Who attends? Enter the Writs. Ful. My passion stifles me. Mas. Are you come My delicate: Devills cut in way? let him not Approach too near, he can take measure Of his forehead at this distance. Pha. These were my fears, marriage had made sure worke, I was against you stay for tilts, and triumphs. Mam. 'Tis Mr. Fulbanke. Ful. Would any strumpet vex an honest man thus? Mam. Strumpet; you shall have fuell to this jealousie. Mas. Excellent Pidgeons! admirable Spiders! ha, ha, ha. Ful. I'l be revenged. Tra. Currat Lex. Pha. Excuse me, Sir, I must follow the Law, Exeunt. The Writs enclose Fulbanke. Mas. Joy Mr. Fulbanke, and a whole bundle of babies, ha, ha, ha. Your wedding day was notably deferr'd To be attended with more Ceremony, And such an antimasque of sucking Devills. He looks like the py'd Piper in Germany, That undertook to cure the Town of Rats, And now the fry of Vermin dance about him. I am left to chew my Countrey cud, an asse, A ridden-empty-pated-sordid Coxcomb: You do command in chief o're Cuckolds sconce Or Haven, to which all the Tups strike saile, And bow in homage to your Soveraigne Antlers. Most high and mighty halfe moon, Prince of Becos. And so I kiss your hoof. Exeunt Maslin and Writs. Ful. Well; if there be money and malice in the City, Expect a black revenge upon ye all. Exit. Enter Phantasme. Pha. My nimble Lawyer thinks he has got my Lady, And hugges his happiness, my next worke shall be To spoile his practice, mischief is my office. Enter Alamode. Most noble Alamode, Ala, My old acquaintance? Pha. I am proud that you will owne me, Sir, you Creature. Ala. When is this day of Triumph in the City. For high and mighty Fulbanke, and your Ladies So much expected marriage? Pha. At the Greeke Calends; My Lady's has left the Alderman allready. He may now change his Heraldry, and give In's coat an armed beast at the new bull-ring In a field dirt. Ala. whether is she gone prethee? Pha. To Travers sir, who has yet no Terme life. Your hopes thrive I guess in the fair Honoria. Ala. She's a haggard too. Pha. Possible? Ala. She has gull'd us learnedly, And took the Scholar, in few months you'le heare Her brought to bed of Philosophy, she's gone, And I may as soone hope to retrive thy Lady, Pha. My Lady? with your pardon, gentle sir, Can you find in your self any warme thought, Or meaning to my Lady? Ala. Could I wish To live, and look at happiness? Pha. You have been a noble Patron to me. Ala. What canst thou do? Pha. Do, I can do the office of a Gentleman, And you shall go your part, and perhaps owner. Ala. Make me so happy. Pha. I'l conduct you, You come i'th opportunity. Exeunt. Enter Travers. Tra. My starres conspire to make me a full happiness, Since same spread my intended marriage With Lady Mammon, methinks the people Look on me with another face of feare, And admiration, in my thoughts I see My self allready in the Throne of Law, In which the petty purples waite, dispersing As I incline to frowne, or smile, the fate Of trembling mortalls, Enter Phantasme. Pha. He is return'd. Tra. Where is thy Lady, thou art (I observe) her favourite. And must be mine; Pha. She's in her Chamber sir. Tra. Come I will have it so, thou art too humble, Pha. 'Tis a becoming Duty. My ambition Will be to observe the wonder of your happiness, And how you'l rise to greatness, and to glory, By matching with my Lady, Tra. You are not A stranger to her closset, it will be An engagement to acquaint me with her temper. Pha. She is a woman, Sir, but you are wise. Tra. Nay, nay, I must know her nature. Pha. 'Tis very gentle, she is angell Gold, And you may bend her as you please, she is A teeming Lady too. Tra. What Children? Pha. All provided for, they'l not trouble you, She has a thousand friends. Tra. Thou art kind, proceedâ Pha. You are a Gentleman, Whose wisdome I may trust, I should not use This freedom else. Tra. Thou maist tell me any thing. Pha. She loves to be abroad, and to disperse Her shine upon some persons that adore her, That's all her fault, she wo'not be confind, Sir; And how the softness of your nature will Consent, to keep her under lock and keyâ Tra. Umh! if she be so volatile, I must Hang weight upon her, 'twill be necessary. Enter a Doctor. Retain thy wisdom and observe my Lady, Pha. It is my duty, Sir. Tra. My noble Client. Doc. I ha not leisure to aske how go causes. Tra. Yours will be heard, the first day of the Term. Doc. I build upon your care. Tra. You may be confident, Neglect my Doctor, to whose care, and art I owe my lungs, and life? Doc. Oh you are pleasant, But I am now engag'd, and shall desire I may be excus'd, you know my Lady Honoria: Tra. She is not sick. Doc. No, but a Gentleman Whom she declares most precious to her, is, I'th height of expectation, and fair hopes To have been her husband,) desperately falne Sick, And now I think on't, 'tis my wonder, you Made no addresses timely to that Lady. Men that are eminent in Law, are wont To be ambitious of Honour. Tra. Oh Sir It is a maxime in our politicks, A Judge destroyes a mighty practiser. VVhen they grow rich, and lazie, they are ripe For honour. Doc. You have Sir a swelling fortune. Tra. I have Mammon, I think, and for my owne part Can easily consent to accept of Lordship. Doc. If this man take the toy, and dye, she's worth Your thoughts, my learned in the Laws, I wish Sir I could serve you. Tra. Nay, nay prethee Doctor. Doc. The Gentleman may suffer, Tra. If he dye, You and I shall be friends, i'le not engage you To poison him. Doc. You have more justice. Tra. Yet I should not breake my heart, if he were dead, And the faire Lady mine, I know not, but This very mention of her, at this nick Of time, when her delight is taking leave, Hath a strange operation in my fancye: You know my constitution, I may want Your ay'd, but honourably. Doc. You shall command it. Tra. Then i'l to her instantly, and beare you company. Doc. You can pretend no visit, being a stranger. Tra. No, I will go under the notion of Your friend, and fellow Doctor, one o'th Colledge. Doc, You may do so. Tra. I need not shift my habit. Doc. And what then? Tra. Observe, and see the Motions of my Lady Who knows but I may feel her pulse? I prophecie Something will follow fortunate. If I thrive Thou shalt be King of Cos, my learn'd Hyppocrate, And I will be thy Servant. Doc. 'Tis too early to court her: Tra. 'Tis a fault of modesty In men to think so. Women are no fools, And howsoe're they bridle it, 'tis providence 'T entertain new comforts, I have heard A modest Gentleman say, that made his love Known to a Lady e're her husbands flesh VVas cold i'th crust, I meane new cofind up, But he had a repulse, the answer was He came too late, the widdow had been promis'd The day before. Doc. If you be so resolv'd, I'le waite upon you, Sir: Tra. The rest to my kind starres, come wee'l take Coach. Exit. Enter Mammon Alamode and Phantasme. Mam. Presume to lock me up? thou ha'st my Jewells. I'l leave him instantly. Ala. He fears his tenure, And would secure your Ladyship from starting, But this doth very well become your prudence, To quit the house e're he improve his interest, By some new quirk in Law. Pha. A noble Gentleman! And one that honours you religiously. Mam. You much obliege me sir, and I look on, you Design'd by providence my preserver; wee'le Into t'h Countrey instantly. Ala. Any whether, excellent Phantasme! I am your Servant Madam, to wait on you Through the VVorld. Pha. I was borne to make youâ A foole, or I am mistaken. Enter Dash. This is his Clarke, and spie upon your person. Ala. How the rascall squints upon us? Mam. Tell Mr. Travers, The Bird is flowne, commend me to his night-cap, I shanot see him till the next vacation, So farewell penny a sheer. Ala. And dost heare? bid him Provide new locks and keys, and barres and bolts, And cap the Chimney, least my Lady fly Out at the Lover hole, so commend us to The precious owle your Master. They kick Dash. Pha. One token from me. Exeunt. Das. You have trusted me with tokens of remembrance, I would my Master had received them in His propria persona, to have thank'd you. Their toes are somewhat harder than my haunches; But this is nothing to the generall damage, If our great Lady Mammon be run from us; VVhich I believe, as sure, as I am waking, And have been kick'd, the most convincing argument. All our hopes come to this? our mighty hopes Huge as a Mountain, shrunke into a wart? VVe are undone, and may go hang our selves. Exit. Enter Honoria. Hon. I was too blame, my curiosity Now suffers for the Triall of his vertue; And he too apprehensive, when I chid The Ambition of his love, made himself past The cure of my affection. Enter Doctor and Travers. Sir, you are welcome: Doc. Madam, I presum'd To bring another able Doctor with me For his consult, in case there may be danger. Hon. You have very much oblieged me. Tra. She is a very gallant Lady! Inspight of all the clouds that dwell upon her. Hon. VVho waits there? shew these Doctors Mr. Alworths Chamber, there is another Gentleman within Of your profession; your cares shall find A gratitude becoming both my self, And your owne worth, and I may tell you Doctor, If it may give the least addition to Your Cheerfulness, in his you will preserve my life. Doct. Madam, retain but your own vertue; and be confident. Hon. Poor Alworth, there is left no other way To pay my satisfaction to thy merits, But with my sorrow for thy sufferings, And what will be thought pious to thy memory, If Fate translate thee hence: ha, he is returned. Enter Traverse. What think you Sir? Tra. I wish he could sleep Madam, I am for his sleep, It would be a benefit, truth is, I much fear him, But 'tis not prudence (give me boldness Madam) To let this Sorrow play too much a Tyrant On your fair cheek: This shews him precious to you, If the Stars envying his converse on Earth, Court him to their bright Dwellings, you must be Arm'd with a noble Fortitude, and consent To let him rise a Constellation there, And not impair your self, who were not meant To be snatch'd hence, by over-hasty sorrow, But live the worlds best Ornament. Hon. Did you say That sleep would much advantage him? What think you Of some soft murmures of the Lure, or Voyce? I have heard the purlings of a spring will make Our senses glide into a dream I have a Page did use To please him much. Ex. Hon. Enter Doctor. Doct. What think you on her? Tra. I think? I cannot think too much upon her. But I'll not leave her thus, her very presence Is able to recover him. Doct. Let me tell you Sir, I finde no Danger in him, be then counsel'd Not to betray your self, you finde his temper Not apt for your design, Expect a timeâ Tra. I love her infinitely. Mammon is a Blouze, A deformed Gypsie, didst ere see her Doctor? She paints abominably, ey'd like a Tumbler, Her Nose has all the colours of the Rainbow, Her Lips are blue, and her teeth straddle, you May pick'em with a bed-staff. Doct. You describe An Elegant person. Tra. But Honoria Has all perfections. Stay, what fees de'e think I have had of you since our acquaintance, there's A purse of goldâno ceremony, I am still In thy arrears for bringing me to see This wonder of her sex. Doct. You are not wilde. Tra. Your cause shall cost you nothing too, that ended, Quarrel with all the Countrey, your Law's paid for. Serve me but now, I'll be thy slave for ever. Exit. Doct. I now suspect the Lawyer is short liv'd, Men of his Robe are seldom guilty of These restitutions, but who can help it? If I knew any handsome way to serve him, He has oblig'd me. Exit. Musick, a Song. Enter Doctor. Doct. He'l shame us all, He's zealously perswading the poor Gentleman To dye with all speed, and tells him stories Of Heaven, what a fine place it is, an what Excellent company the Angels are; What a base Prison to a noble Soul The world is, nothing right under the Moon, Or worth a manly thought; and presently He courts my Lady, and falls into such raptures In her commendation. The Gentleman (Whose Crisis is not desperate, if I Have any Judgement) smiles at his folly. They'r both here. Enter Traverse and Honoria. Tra. He's a Gentleman, whose condition, And as he has relation to your favours, May invite some passion: But you are wiset Then to condemn your self to solitude, And for his absence to despise mankinde; Be just for your own sake, and Madam, look Beyond his Hearse, with pitty on the living, 'Mongst which, you cannot want, as just admirers, And some that may be worth your second thoughts. Hon. What mean you Sir? Tra. I mean your second choice. Hon. This language makes your Charity suspected. Doct. You are too violent, leave us a while. Ex. Tra. Hon. Your friend is full of counsel. Doct. You have goodnes, To place an innocent sense upon his language, I know he has much honour to your person, And 'tis sometimes as necessary, to Advise the living to preserve their health, Which their immoderate sorrows would consume As cure the languishing patient. Exit. Enter Travers hastily. Tra. Now Madam, Your grief is useless to him, he is dead. Hon. Dead? Doct. She Faints. Tra. A blessed Opportunity! There is a Coach at door will hold us all, My dearest Esculapian, help, and finde A bounty will deserve it. They carry in Honoria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Traverse. Tra. I have secur'd the person of Honoria, At my Mannor in the Countrey, who believes Her Alworth dead, and must be allowed some time For that digestion. I have made known My self, and the affection which engag'd me. But though my Lady Mammon have a place Beneath her in my thoughts; on better counsel, I think it wisdom to preserve my interest In her, already mine by her consent, And the great plea of Law, Possession. If I can make the Lady Honoria sure, She shall be my wife, and that my Concubine, Rare, Excellent! Enter Dash. Dash. Oh Sir, y'are welcome home. Tra. Thou look'st with a warp'd face. Dash. You can resolve me, Is there no case, wherein a man, without Impeachment to his Credit or his Conscience, May be allowed to hang himself? Tra. What's the matter? Thou art not desperate? Dash. I know not, but I finde some inclinations to Hemp. You are my Master, I may be concern'd To follow a good example. Tra. Leave your fooling, How does my Lady Mammon? Da. There's the business. My Lady Mammon is Sirâ Tra. What, what is she? Das. She is my Lady Mammon, yet I lye, She is not mine, I would she were your Worships, I know you will be mad, but it must out, My Ladies gone. Tra. Ha? Das. Run quite away Sir, With a glib Gentleman came to visit her, And the young spirit that did wait upon her. Without much ceremony, she would have your Worship Provide more locks, and keys, and bars, and bolts. I tell you Sir, Verbatim, for a need I have it all in pedescript. Tra. Mammon gone? Das. What think you Sir, of a ne Exeat Regnum? Tra. Gone? my vexation? no pursuit will reach her, Give her the start, and she'll out-strip the Devil. These things will turn me wild, but that's no cure, I must be a man agen, and tame this passion, Her loss may have recompence, if Honoria Can yet be gain'd, my hopes are full of blossom, I'll return instantly, come you along Sir. Enter Men carrying burthens of Money. What are these? ha? 'tis money, whence I pray Comes all this Treasure? 1. From the City Sir. Tra. But whether goes it? 1. Do you not observe Us march in rank and file, this money goes To maintain many honest Gentlemen That want it, that will fight, and do fine things For all our goods; you are a fool I see, And do not know the Law. Tra. What Law? 1. Club Law. Tra. How's that? 1. The Cannon Law, do I speak loud enough? The Gentlemen behinde will tell you more. Enter Fulbank and Citizens, other men waiting with Bags of money. Tra. I like not this: let us to horse immediately. Exit. Ful. 'Tis high time, that we tame the insolence, Of this long Robe, these Princes of the Law Will invade all our Liberties and Fortunes. 1. Cit. Presume to take our Lady Mammon from us? Ful. And as I hear, she's closely hurried To a Castle in the Countrey, made a Prisoner. 2. Cit. I should consent the City be still great, And our names spread, like our ambitions, But we not prudently consider, whom We trust with our revengeâ Ful. Our Mercenaries, Who findes 'em buff, and iron, and when they Come lame and halting home, who shall provide 'em Good Hospitals, and old shirts to make lint on? When we please, we can scatter all the Regiments, If we but rein our purses. 1. Cit. I am clear There is no other way to carry on The work, the sword strikes Terrour, and who knows, The body of the Law being vast, and powerful, Might (if not timely thus prevented) raise Considerable strength and opposition. But thus we stifle all, and having once Recovered Mammon, we are Princes. Omnes, Princes! Enter Colonel, and Captain Squanderbag: Squ. Where shall we dine Colonel? I ha lost My credit at the Ordinary, this Town I think is onely scituate to starve in. What are these? Col. They have City faces. Squa. And are a thought too handsome to be Serjeants, They have serious eyes upon us, and move to us. Col. Would you with me Gentlemen? Ful. Yes Sir, with you. 2 Cit. May I take boldness Sir, to ask your name? Squa. My name? 2 Cit. For no harm Sir, you are a Souldier, And I presume have had commands. Squa. What then Sir, keep off. 2 Cit. I come in friendship, and mean all Civilities to your person: De'e want money? Squ. Would you have your pate broke? For such a foolish question to a Gentleman? I do want money Sir, you wo'not furnish me. 2 Cit. Do not mistake your self, come hither sirrah, VVill this do you much harm? Squ, Harm! pray be covered. Miracles!

VVere it not pity this should be a dream now? Ful. You have commission, and full instructions, Be sure you do not pinch to spare our purses, Our Money grows, we are fain to weed the silver, Our men are rank, and rot upon the stalk For want of cutting, every drum-stick is A Lime-twig, they are mad for innovations, Pray know my brother Sir. Salute Col. I am his faithful servant. 2 Cit.

VVhat do you Think of these Golden Images? Squa. I honour the bright sons of Sol. Col. Pity these Gentlemen should want Civil VVar, They take such pains, and pay so heartily, VVe have much to do o'th sudden. Squa. This long peace Hath made us tame i'th world, let e'm now pay 'fort.

That were excellent, we want Religion extreamly. Mas. Can none of you invent? I think I must Keep men in pension to project me ways To spend my gold. 2. Pave all the high-way with't, 'Twould be excellent for Travellers. Mas. I'll pave a street, that shall run cross the Island, From Sea to Sea, with Pearl build a bridge From Dover Cliff to Callis. 1. A Draw-bridge? 4. This may be done, but I am of opinion VVe shan'ot live to see't. Mas.

Intreat my Lady hither, and attend her, I did embrace too much, Mammon is lost, If my stars prosper my ambition To Honoria, I forgive their future influence. A Discovery of Treasures and Jewels. Here is a blaze to melt a frozen soul. Enter Honoria. Hon. VVhat is my Jaylors pleasure with his Prisoner? Tra. That character doth wound your servant, Madam, I am your Prisoner, by the fate of Love, Condemnd to everlasting chains, my heart Consumes at every frown, and I beg now Not to be happy owner of that beauty, Since you decree my Exile, but to dye, Collect up so much terrour in a look, And from that Throne of Majestie, your eyes, Dart forth a flame of wrath so high, it may Turn me to ashes, I'll submit your Sacrifice. Hon. I have no thoughts so impious, to destroy A life that may be happy, if you be not Your own Tormenter. Tra. Those words have a sound of mercy, Madam. Hon. Cruelty and honour Are inconsistent. Tra. I taste Heaven, Already, a warm stream descends upon My timorous heart; Oh pause, let me consider How much I am behinde in worth, to know VVhat change hath blest it. Hon. Change? Tra. Let me but touch Your white hand, were my breath the Treasure of all the, East, no other Altar should Have Incense, I am lost to finde the sweetness. Salutes her. For every smile I drop a Pearl, these Diamonds Are pale, and beg a lustre from your Eyes, VVear them, and be their ornament: I'll rifle My Indies for more wealth, and when I have, With giving up my soul, purchas'd a kiss Of bright Honoria, from my dust at one, One pittying look upon me, I ascend A new Creation from your Eye. Hon. What means This rapture? what would all this passionate noise? Expound, I am still Honoria. Tra. Oh say but mine. Hon. Sir, shut up your shop, Your gay temptations wo'not take. Tra. Is't possible? Not all this treasure buy one kiss? Hon. A thousand, From those that have a subtil art to sell them: Why do you trifle with your soul? Intents That carry honour, need not bribe with wealth To purchase nothing. Tra. I can love you vertuously. Hon. By that love be commanded then, to tell me How have you dispos'd of Alworths dust, when was I Surpris'd dishonourably, and transported Against my own thoughts and consent, to this Unhappy place? and immur'd up like Some guilty person, not allow'd the freedom Of ayr, nor to see heaven at all, but from The narrow limits of a Cazement? can you Interpret this affection? 'tis tyrannie, That must without a penitence draw from heaven A justice, and from me (by you made miserable) A just contempt of all your flatteries. Tra. There are some men i'th world, that would not think You handsom in that look, and make you tremble. Hon. You dare not be so impious. Tra. When my love, That courts you honourably is scorn'd, I can Be angry, had I wanton thoughts about me, As some may mix with flesh and blood, you are Within my power. Hon. That power is circumscrib'd, You have confin'd already this poor weight Of Dust I carry, but if blacker thoughts Tempt you to force my honour, I can call Rescue from heaven. Tra. What needs this bravery? you see I use No violence, I court you to a Bride. Hon. My vows once gave me up a pledge to Alworth, And my heart cut out for his Epitaph, Will not contain one Character beside. Tra. I play my self to death in flames unpittied: Resolve, not look for tedious considerings; If I may honourably succeed your Alworth, His soul had not a purer faith to serve you, If this be slightedâ Enter Dash the Clark. Das. Help, help, we are all undone, O Sir, where is Your two handed sword? Tra. Thou Messenger of Horror, what's the matter? Das. The Castle is besieg'd, and the Beacons burns blue Sir. The Devil's up in Arms, and comes against us With the whole posse Comitatus! they Will pull the house down, they have broke into The base Court, Heaven protect my Pia mater. I did but peep out of the Garrat, and One Souldier swore a huge Granado at me. They cry down with the Laws, and if they have not Honoria sound of wind and limb, they'll cut us, Sir, into Labels. Would I had compounded For any leg, or my left arm; but now, Now farewel comely Court-hand, and long Dashes, Do you not hear the Mandrakes? what do you do Sir? I'll not into the Cellar straight, and bar the door, And if there be no remedy, e're they reach me, I'll drink, and dye a Martyr. Tra. I am blasted! stay, There is a close contrivement in this Chamber, Madam, will you retreat, and save your person? This way sirrah. Exeunt. Dash. De'e think they will not smell us out? I fear My constitution wo'not hold. Souldiers within. Down with the Laws &amp; custos Rotulorum, Fico for Writs and Mous-Traps. Enter Officers, General, and Fulbank. Off. Make a guard Souldiers. Ful. I am come Sir, to see fashions. Col. You finde us drudging Sir, in your affairs, Captain, I leave him to your entertainment, That face deserves a reverence. Hon. 'Tis the Colonel, But he looks more compos'd, and carries state. Col. Madam. Ful. And how go things, my Military friends? My gallant men of action? you are now In sprightly postures, and become your selves, What pitty 'tis, men of your noble soul Should want employment. Squa. We must all acknowledge Your care of us. Ful. I honour'd your profession, Since I first handled Arms. Squa. What service, with your favour, have you seen? Ful. Hot service, I was knock'd down thrice, and lost My beard at taking of a Fort in Finsbury, And when I had my Marshal trinkets on, I thought my self as brave a Macedonian As the best on e'm. But where's the Lady Mammon? Col. Surprized? and ever since a Prisoner? He is not worth my passion, this room Has in your presence a protection. I take your word, you wo'not quit the place Without your servants knowledge, Madam, but If the slie Enemy of your honour, think By obscuring his base head, to fly our Justice, When you are safe, I'll fire the house upon him. Das. Here, here we are, fire, fire. Tra. Be silent Villain. Das. Yes, and be burnt alive, I cannot finde the door. Col. From whence that voice? Das. 'Tis here, 'tis here, I hate burning, as I do the Devil, and a dry Proverb, help. Squa. The Lawyers here. Tra. Gentlemen use no violence, I'll come forth And meet your fury. Cap. What are you sirrah? Das. A poor Court-hand practiser. Cap. The choice is given, whether thou wilt be hang'd At the next tree, or have your ears cut off? Das. My ears, my ears by any means Gentlemen, Hanging will make a villainous long Dash. Once crop'd, and twice a Traytor, sweet Gentlemen, Delicate Commanders. Tra. Time has brought Your turn about, by your respects to honour, I see your soul is noble; though I cannot Dye at my own choice, I can make a will, And dispose some Legacies, rich Jewels, Sir, Plate, Gold, and Silver. Ful. All this I lay claim to, They were the Lady Mammons, in whose right I challenge all, I take those to my custodie. Col. How? How? Marshal take him to yours. Ful. Me to the Marshal? that were pretty, me? Mar. Come Sirâ Ful. How? I beseech one word, have you forgot me Sir? Col. Your name is Fulbank. Ful. Plain Fulbank? it was I, Did in those days bring in the good advance. Col. You did, your duty Marshallâ Ful. I ha done Sir, Col. So have not I, secure his person too, Safe, as your life will answer it. Enter one with a Letter. Letters, whence? ha? From Alamode? He reads: Alworth Discovers himself to Honoria, Squanderbag observes them. He writes where a party of horse may handsomely Secure the Lady Mammon, give him a reward, Make it your province Captain, you will finde Directions in that paper. Whispers. Squa. Sir, I have observ'd That Gentleman with the black-patch uncase His eye once to my Lady, there's some mysterie, I do not like it. Col. Some spie: when I walk off, command him to the Guard till further order. Madam, I call it my first happiness, That I am in a capacity to serve you, And you shall order your own justice. Hon. What will they do with that young Gentleman? Col. She mindes not me. Hon. Your pardon. Col. Give me favour to attend you, With whom my soul desires to be renew'd, Your faithful honourer, march on. Ex. Co. &amp;c. Alw. I obey you. Squa. You will know the cause hereafter, and us better. When both your eyes are open. Pulls of the Patch. Cap. Thou hast cur'd him: de'e know us Sir? Alw. I know ye all. Squa. What are we? Alw. You're all close fires, in want of aire kept tame, But know no bounds, let loose into a flame. Squa. We'll teach you better Morals Sir, Come on. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Enter Squanderbag and a Captain. Cap. His thoughts are all now taken up with Courtship To Honoria. Squa. You may see Captain, A handsome piece of flesh and blood may do much, VVhen there's no other enemy i'th the field. Cap. VVhat will be done with the Gentleman was carried To the guard? Squa. The stranger with a black Eye? He's fast enough, and will have opportunity Of place and time, to cool his hot devotions, If our Commander in chief march on thus. Enter Serjeant and Souldiers. Ser. Are not these pretty hand Granado's, Gentlemen? 1 Sol. Fire to the fuze, and toss some health about. 2 So. Come away, to my Colonel, honest Squanderbag. Squa. Ha? these are my Scythians, mark those fellows Captain, Cut 'em in pieces like so many Adders, They'l joyn agen, i'th compass of an acre, Their limbs will creep together, and march on To the next Rendevouz without a halt. 2 Ser. This is Spanish. Ler. Draw home your arrow to the head, my Centaure. 1. So. Mine is French Wine. 5 So. You must take your chance, The Yeoman of the wine-seller did not Provide 'em for our palate. 2 So. Supernaculum! See, there lies Spain already, now would I fightâ Ser. Drink thou mean'st. 2 Sol. VVith any King in Europe. Do not spill your Amunition; ah Serjeant, This was excellent Drink. 1 So. VVho wants my Colonel? 2. So. I want it, tope, give me't. Ser. He'l ha't agen? 2 So. The to'ther charge, and then we'll over-run Christendom, Sa, sa: When y'ave done with Christendome, what shall Become o'th Heathen Princes? 2 So. We'll put the Heathen Princes in a bag. Ser. A bottle thou meanest, he's all for drink. 2 So, And after, roast the Great Turk with his Bashaws, Like a pudding in's belly. Squa. Thou Boy! Ser. There he is for eating. Ser. Dost know what thou hast said now? but What shall be done with the Jews? 2 Sol. They are included, And go upon the score of Modern Christians, There sha'not a Nation scape us. Squa. These are the men, The tools, that cut our Triumph out o'th quarry. Cap. They will deserve their pay. Squa. Oh pay is necessary, use it now and then, Like Phisick, it keeps the Souldier in health And expectation, they must fight for honour Some-times. 1 So. Tobacco, they? Ser. Here boys, a Magazine, with pipes attending, VVhite as my Ladies tooth, and shining more Then forehead of Dulcinea de Toboso. 4 So. A Souldier's a brave life. 3 So. 'Tis cheap, all these things come to us by nature. Ser. Our Colonel. Squa. I'll cashier him that rises, keep your postures, We are all Souldiers, and can sit and drink we'e, To your Arms Gentlemen agen, ha? this is wine. Ser, We have the modest gift of drinking, Sir, Without inquiry of the Grape or Vintage, Or from what Merchant. Squa. Is not this better than a tedious Prentiship, Bound by Indentures to a shop and drudgerie, Watching the Rats, and Customers by Owl light? Ti'd to perpetual language of, What lack ye? Which you pronounce, as ye had been taught like Sterlings. If any Gudgin bite to damn your souls For less than sixpence in the pound. Oh base! Your glittering shoes, long graces, and short meals, Expecting but the comfortable hour Of eight a clock, and the hot Pippin pies, To make your mouth up? all the day not suffered To aire your selves, unless your minikin Mistress Command you to attend her to a Christning, To bring home plums, for which they may relieve Your teeth that water, with her next suppositorie. You have some Festivals, I confess, but when They happen, you run wilde to the next Village, Conspire a knot, and club your groats apiece For Cream and Prunes, not daring to be drunk, Nothing of honour done, now y'are Gentlemen, And in a capacitie to be all Commanders, if you dare fight, 2 S. Fight? you know we dare, Sir, And with the Devil. 2 Squa. In hope you wo'not give him quarter, There's money, do not purchase Earth, nor Heaven with it. I must away, remember the two things. 1 So. The two Dees. Squa. Drink, and your Duty, so, Now as you wereâ 2 So. Noble Colonel, Exit. Let me kiss thy hand, I am thine body and soul. 3 So. But will you fight with the Devil? 2 So. Why not? 3 So. So will not I. 2 So. Wo'not you fight with the Devil, and one of Our Regimen? 3 So. Not I? 1 So. Perhaps the Devil is his friend. 3 So. And yet in a good causeâ 2 So. He wo'not fight with you then, base, I say, To take advantage of the cause, or person: Fight upon any cause with any person. Heark you Serjeant, you do know our Duties Better than we our selves, what do we fight for! Silence the first word of Command, let us Be serious, what, what do we fight for? Ser. For pay, for pay, my Bull-rooks. 2 So. La'ye now, Can any Christian Officer say more? Ser. Hang these Intergatories, And give us to'her charge to'th man i'th Moon. 2 So. All, all give fire together, Oh for a noise Of Trumpets. Drums beat. 1 So. Here are Drums. Ser. The General is coming this way, to your Arms Skud ye Metropolites. Enter Colonel, Squanderbag, Captain and Alamode. Ala. Sir, I congratulate your honourable Employment. Col. And I your noble presence here. Ala. I could not with my Rhetorick invite My Ladie hither? Col. I sent you a partyâ Ala. Yes Sir, Your men of rank and file do carry still The strong perswasions, they prevail'd with her. I left her to the Guard. A shout. Col. The reason of that Clamor? Cap. The Souldiers, Sir, express their joy thus loud, That Ladie Mammon is brought in, the Guard Hardly secure her person. Col. Give her fair access, On pain of death, be none uncivil to her, This service will deserve a memory, And publique thanks, all our design did reach But to gain her. Ala. The work will be to keep her, The Gipsie has more windings than a Serpent, The Moon is not more changing. Enter Mammon, Phantasm, Guard. Col. Is this she? Phan. Madam, I'll take my leave. Mam. Forsake me in this Condition? Phan. If I could expect a worse Would fall upon you, Madam, I'd not part yet. Mam. How? Phan. For I can tell you, what will follow instantly, And it does please my wickedness extreamly, The next pay-day you will be torn in pieces, Oh 'twill be excellent sport, ha, ha, ha. Mam. And canst thou laugh Villain? Secure him Souldiers. Phan. They will have work enough about your Ladiship. I am going as nimbly as a spirit, Madam, And to your greater comfort, know I am one. Mam. The Devil thou art. Phan. Call'd by another name, Your evil Genius, to assure you that You have been all this while cozened, my dear Mistress, And that these colours are phantastick, see, I vansh into aire. Guard. Presto, was this your Devil, Madam? Mam. Oh my misfortune! Col. Madam, your person is most welcome hither. Mam. I fear your Souldiers, Sir, Col. You may be confident Of safety from them, Madam, that fight for you, We are your guard, all wait upon my Ladie, And let your applications be with reverence, And see her entertainments high, and such As may become my honour, and her person. Exit. What is there left addition to my happiness? Mammon and Honoria both within my power? Ambition write non ultra, fix, fix here, The two great darlings of mankinde are mine, Both Excellent, and yet but one Divine. Wealth is the nerves of VVar and VVit, without which VVe are dull, and useless engines, Mammon leads To Conquest, and rewards our blood and watches, But honour is the lustre of all Triumph, The Glories that we wear are dim without her, Till she come in, the Lamp, our glorious flame, VVe grope our way i'th dark, and walk on crutches. Riches may shine, and Star-like grace the night, But Honour is the radiant soul of light. Exit. Alworth in Prison. Alw. I almost could be angry with my fate, And call that care of my Phisitian Unkinde, that did remove my first distempers; I should have drop'd into the shades, and lost Her memory, that flatters me to ruine. VVhat's all this murmure? are these thoughts my own? Or is there some black spirit crept into My melancholy blood, that would corrupt That spring, by which my innocence should live? Hence, I command thee hence, thou dire Inchantment, And let the vertues of Honoria Resume their throne within my soul, and strike Religious tremblings through every thought, Lest I repine at Providence? She is here. Enter Honoria, and Marshal. Mar. This warrant must admit you. Hon. There's for your Office, you may withdraw your self. Mar. Your servant! Exit. Hon. Oh my Alworth? Alw. This humility Transcends my hope and merit, I am now No more a Prisoner, since my better part (Enlarg'd by this your charitable visit) Hath freedom to behold my greatest happiness, Your self. Hon. I am so full of joy To see thee alive, I cannot ask thee, how Thou wert preserv'd. Alw. Heaven was not willing I Should die, till I had given you better proof How much I would deserve your smile upon me. Enter Colonel and Marshal. Mar. Here you may, undiscovered, Sir, observe 'em. Col. You may be gone, and wait at some fit distance. Alw. My cure was hastned by your thoughts up on me, And my desires had wings to reach your person, (For I was soon acquainted how you were Convey'd) and next my thoughts to kiss your hands, I brought my resolutions of revenge Upon that Traitors head, that ravish'd ye So rudelie from my eies. Hon. Prethee no more, But let our hearts renew, and seal a contract In spight of present storms; and I am not VVithout some hopes to change thy sad condition, For he, to whose commands thou owest this misery, Is pleas'd to say he loves me, and I can Employ his kindeness to no better use Then thy Enlargement; if this prove unfortunate, It shall at least diminish thy affliction, That I can bear a part, and suffer with thee. Alw. Better I sink by many deaths, then you Engage your self to any unkinde Fate For me; I have crept newly from my dust, And can alone walk cheerfully to silence And the dark grave: But do you believe, Madam, This man looks on you with a noble flame? He's now a great man. Hon. His affection Has all the shews of honour; and such high Civilities flow from him. Alw. Pause a little, And give me leave to tell you, as these seeds Of VVar grow up, I cannot think a person Though many may be honourable) can Better Deserveâ Hon. VVhat? Alw. To be made Lord of this Fair Empire. Hon. Did this language come from Alworth? That said he lov'd me? Alw. Yes, with noblest fervor, My love commands it Madam, and I can In my true service to Honoria, Advise her to call home her noble beams, That shine to the discredit of her light On me, that would upon a worthier object Draw up more admiration to her brightness, And at the same time, by their influence shew The beauties of her better choice. Hon. This language I understand not yet; can Alworth then Finde in his heart any consent, to give up His interest in Honoria to another? Alw. Yes, when Honoria is concern'd to meet A greater happiness than Alworth, I Can make my self an Exile, which is but The justice of my love to her great merit. I am a trifle Madam, a thing meant Beneath your smile, a very walking shadow, And time will come, when you have shew'd me all The bounties of your grace, nay seal'd them mine, By the most holy character of marriage, Yet then I must forsake you, when my nerves Shrink up, when the weak flowings of my blood Cool in their channel, and dame Nature leave me A spoil to deathâ Hon. VVhy do you talk of death, So far off? Alw. Though we do not hear him tread, Yet every minute he approaches, Madam; And give me leave to tell you, without flattering My self, I am in danger; first a Prisoner, A spie they may pretend, but this will vanish. It is the title of your servant, Madam, Is both my honour, and my crime, nor can I VVave my relation to your favours: this Known to the man, under whose power we stand, His angrie breath may doom me to the scaffold, And I must then resign, nor will the act Be mine, but a constraint, and I then lose The glorie that may now be mine, to engage Him in your smiles, you in his love. Hon. VVhen will this dream be over? Alw. As for me, It shall be enough at distance to look on you VVith thoughts as innocent as your own, and if For the convenience of both our persons, One Earth must not contain us, do not think That I can wander, where I shall forget To tell the stranger world your storie, Madam; And when I have made all mankinde, where I come, Bow to your name, and taught 'em to repeat it In all their dangers, and their frights, to cure them, I will seek out some aire, that is infectious, VVhere no birds dare inhabit, or man build A cottage to repose his wearied head, And there I prophesie, by the vertuous charm Of your blest name, to purge it, and as soon As the great miracle is spread, to invite The best of every Nation to live there, And own you Tutelar Angel. Hon. Fie, no more, Alworth now dreams indeed, but he more vainlie Perswades me to forget my vows to him: Is this a fear to die, or something like it? For I would give it fain some other name. Alw. A fear to die, that arrow strikes too deep, If you but think so, and wounds more than all The horror my destruction can appear in. If I can entertain the thoughts of life Without you, how much easier must it be To die for your concernment? I ha'not liv'd After the rate to fear another world. VVe come from nothing into life, a time VVe measure with a short breath, and that often Made tedious too, with our own cares that fill it, VVhich like so many Atomes in a Sun-beam, But crowd and justle one another. All, From the adored Purple to the Hair-cloth, Must center in a shade, and they that have Their vertues to wait on 'm, bravely mock The rugged storms, that so much fright 'em here, VVhen their souls lanch by death into a sea That's ever calm. Hon. This deserves my attention, And you in this small lecture Alworth, have Made me in love with death, who for thy sake Can with my innocence about me, take More satisfaction to bleed away My life, than keep it, with the smallest stain Upon my honour. This I speak, not to Court up your drooping thoughts to me, if I Be faln, or have lost my first esteemâ Alw. Oh pardon, t'other syllable of this destroys me; VVhat is there, can but make me worthy of Your faith? I am all, ever thine? The Colonel. Enter Colonel. Col. Expect a cloud to darken all your triumphs! Exit. Hon. His threats move me as little, as his love, Yet for thy sake I can be sad. Alw. And I But onely mourn for you. Enter Colonel with a Pistol, and Travers. He is return'd, And with him the first poisoner of our peace; VVhat horrour next? Col. Your happiness is now VVithin your reach, kill but that fellow, and Possess her by my gift, the act once done By my command secures thee. Hon. He shall make His passage to thee through my heart. Tra. I thank you For your great promise and employment, Sir, But take your tool agen, Col. Did you not love her? Tra. Yes infinitely, but scorn your Hangman's Office: I have done too much alreadie; but if Madam, The memorie of my base surprize have not VVeig'd me down past all fathom of your mercy, I can ask you forgiveness in my heart, And suffer all his Tyrannie, to expiate My black offence to you, and to that Gentleman. Col. Are you so resolute? Tra. VVere I assur'd There were no punishment to attend this murder Here, nor hereafter, could she pardon this Bloodie assassination, and Alworth Forgive me, when his soul is gliding through The purple stream, and mounting up to fill Some happie star, would she herself consent To be the great reward of the black deed, I should abhor the Parricide. Col. Is't so? expect my next return. Exit. Alw. Sir, you have shewn a penitence would strike A marble through, and this return to pietie, Hath chang'd our anger into Admiration. Hon. Sir, we have now no thoughts, but what are fi'd, With a desire you call us to your friendship; Live happie, and adorn by your example Of justice, the most honoured robe you wear. Enter Colonel, Alamode, Fulbank, Squanderbag and Mammon. Col. Nay ye shall witness all my resolution; Your hand, deer Madam, Alworth take from me Thy own Honoria, it were impious To keep you a minute longer in your fears, Your loves deserve my admiration, not My anger, and I cheerfully resign All my ambitions, live you happie both. As I am in this conquest of my self: I lov'd Honoria well, but justice better. But Madam, though you must be Alworths Bride, Yet give me leave to call you Mistress, I Can be your servant still, and by your influence Upon me, steer my actions, and keep My passions in as much obedience, As any Souldier I command, and Alworth Be you so just, to tell the world that takes Delight to snarl, and catch at every errour In our profession: I am no enemy To Arts, but can take pleasure to reward Learning, with all due honour, be your self The example. Alw. You are perfect In all that's noble, and it were a sin Not to proclaim it. Tra. Sir, This act will crown Your name for ever. Col. Make your peace with Honoria, Hor. 'Tis done, and we owe all we can call happy To your justice, Sir. to Mammon. Col. Madam, you look upon us through some cloud, None should be worn this day, and here are some Did wear the title of your servant. Fulbankâ Ful. Oh you are trulie noble, I ever honoured my Ladie. Col. Travers, Alamode, Squa. Please you to name me in the list, I can Be as much a servant to this Ladie, as The best of these. Col. Stand forth, and plead your merits. Mam. I excuse them, Your pardon Sir, I think the best in all the File unworthie of me. Col. Plain truth, Gentlemen. Mam. I could give reasons, but I have no humor To spoil some reputations in publique. Ala. I told you what a Gypsie 'twas. Mam. Some may Traduce my fame, and charge me with a levity And frequent change, but I have been less constant, Because I found no man had wit enough To manage me, or worth enough to invite The stay of my affections. I acknowledge The Citizen doth promise fair, but breaks: Lawyers are cunning, but I love not snares: The Courtier has no care of his own body; The Countrey-man had no wit but in his acres: And for you, Sir, your name is Squanderbag, What would you do with Mammon, cannot keep her? Beside, these men had the bad luck to court me When I was swaid by an evil genius, Which now has left me. I see alreadie A nobler path, and till I finde a man Knows how to love, and govern me with temperance, I lay my self an humble servant at Honoria's feet; your pardon to my past Neglects, will make me cheerfull to attend you. Col. Nay, since y'are come to be my fellow-servant, If you please, Madam, we may approach neerer; What think you of me, shall I present my self A servant to your favour? Mam. Sir, you are pleasant. Col. I shall be so, if you accept my service; Though I am a Souldier, I can love, and do All duties may become your worth and honour. Mam. I blush to say how much I am unworthie, But I shall meet you honourably. Col. A match, seal it. Salute. Ful. He has don't it compendiously; But Sir, you knowâ Col. Yes, I know very well what you would say, But this fair Lady's mine, and I'll deserve her: Wealth has alreadie made you mad, we have been Out of the Sun a great while, I invite You all my guests to day, and Ladie Mammons, Do me that honour. Ful. There is no remedie. Enter Maslin strip'd. Ala. 'Tis well you scap'd with loss of Mammon. Col. What anti-Masquers this? Mam. 'Tis Mr. Maslin. Cap. This fellow wod not bend, and so they broke him. Mas. You look like the Commander in chief Of this Militia. Col. What then? Mas. I have a suit to you. Col. A suit? methinks y'are naked. Mas. I know not, but on my knees I beg their pardon That made me so, they plunder'd me so quaintly, They are the nimblest Hocus Pocus's That e're threw dice for hemp. Col. I am glad they fitted you. Mas. No Sir, it was the Tailor fitted me. Col. So, and they unfitted you. Mas. But with what art, how most compendiously They made me an Adamite, Sirâ Col. Let's hear your wonder. Mas. One ill look'd fellow did but swear an oath, And my hat flew up with the very wind of it, And fell upon a head, that stood bare for it Full three yards off: Another did but squint upon my legs, And my boors vanish'd with the spurs upon 'em; Cloak, doublet, jerkin, all convenient broad cloth, Three pile of wool, went from me at one motion; No bars nor buttons could prevail a minute, They broke into my bodie with that nimble Burglarie; I was undone e're I could wink; But when my narrow shirt came o're my shoulders, I thought't had been my skin, at every twitch I roar'd, and gave my self gone for a Rabbet For the next Officers supper. Col. In good time. Mas. But truth appear'd when I was strip'd, their charitie Left me my breeches, but the good old gold Could not have leave to bear 'em companie, That was defaulk'd miraculously by a Mirmidon That had lost both his handsâ Ala. Lost both his hands, How could he take your money? Mas. With his stumps, Sir, He routed both my pockets with his stumps; Oh the knack some men have to fetch our money. Col. He is pleasant, see his wardrobe be restord. Mas. Shall I be warm agen, Oh Madamâ Squa. Be not too sawcie, she is now exalted Above your sphere. Ful. Oh Mr. Maslin, we are all undone. Mas. So am I, they have not left me a shirt. Col. All faults, where we have power this day, are pardon'd. Ala. Happiness crown your loves! Col. Now to the Priest, Whose work is onely wanting to confirm us: Alworth, lead on your fairest Bride, remember We are both servants to Honoria. Alw. To shew I can obey you Sir, come Madam. The Birth of Heaven, and the Earths Morning-star, Col. Our life of Peace, and the true soul of War. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
