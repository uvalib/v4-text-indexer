      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE I. A Romantic View by moonlight, embracing a range of stupendous and picturesque Rocks, enclosing an extensive Lakeâmoon beams playing on its surfaceâon the right hand near the front wing, a small neat Cottageâin the centre a rugged fragment of Rock, rudely formed in the shape of St. Andrew's Cross, inscribed: âSacred to the Memory of Murdered Athlin.ââA fanciful Fairy Grot on the left. A Fairy enters, and beckons on others. AIRâFAIRY. [1.] Hark! the love-lorn Nightingale Sweetly tells his tender Tale, Bids Elves and Sprites, and Fays convene, To listen to the Lover's lay: Trip where the spangling Moon-beams play, And welcome Halloween! 2. In magic charms and spells the Night To mystic Revels does invite Each Rustic King and Queen; In Fancy's mirror proud to see The wonders of futurity Foretold on Halloween! 3. The Maid who'd wish to be a Bride, The every spell has trembling tried, By all but us unseen; Which prophesies her future state, Butâvanishâgroups here hie elate, To welcome Halloween! The Fairies vanishâenter several Rustics, Male and Female. DIALOGUE TRIO. Janet, and Male and Female Rustic. Janet. My Ee'en I closed right early, To pluck sa blyth and bonny; A plant of Kail, for thereby Hangs tocher gued The first ceremony of Halloween, is pulling each a stock or plant of Kailâthey must go out hand in hand with their Eyes shut, and pull the first they meet with, its being big or little, straight or crooked, is prophetic of the size, and shape of the grand object of all their spellsâthe Husband or Wife, if any yerd or earth stick to the root, that is tocher or fortune. Vide Burns. and money. The stems as spells I'll sure place, And soon will they discover; As chance bids Lads our door pass, The name of my True-Lover! Rustic. Here awaâthere awaâit matters mickle, Here awaâthere awaâtricks have been play'd! Love's stalks are scanted, The top Grain is wanted. This spell is executed by each going at three several times, and pulling a stalk of Oats.âIf the third stalk wants the grain at the top of the stalk, the party in question will come to the marriage-bed any thing but a Maid. Vide Burns. And Mause gangs to Kirk any thing but a Maid. Female Rustic. Alone to the Kiln from my Daddies haim, My Daddies haimâmy Daddies haim; I hasted away, and half daft wi' shame, Hoot!âo'er the Banks hurl'd the clue. Whoever would with success, try this spell, must strictly observe these directions: steal out, all alone, to the kiln and darkling, throw into the pot a clue of blue yarn; wind it in a new clue off the old one; and towards the latter end, something will hold the thread; demand, who holds? an answer will be returned from the kiln-pot, by naming the Christian, and Sur-name of your future spouse. Vide Burns. N. B. The Characters have been supposed to have tried the preceding spells, previous to their coming on the Stage, and each tells the event of such trial to his or her Neighbour. There wound ane anew as I was bade, Wha holds? cry'd I as I pull'd the thread; 'Twas Jemmy M'Gregor, and he is the Lad That willingly Annie may wooe! QUARTETTO RUSTICSâECHOED BY FAIRIES. Rustics. Sprites, now through air advancing, Gayly smile, Bewitchâbeguile. Echo. âBewitchâbeguile. Rustics. To Echo! hark! they're dancing. Other Rustics. Echo! noâ'twas thee! Echo. âNoâ'twas thee! Rustics. Nay, prithee only hear them! 'Tis some spell, Adieuâfarewellâ Eccho. âAdieuâfarewellâ Rustics. Gued troth, and much I fear them! Listen!â'tis not me! Echo. âListen!â'tis not me! Exeunt. Enter Osbert, faint and weary, having lost his way; reclines against the St. Andrew's Crossâa groan is heardâhe starts, and tremblingly peruses the inscription. PATHETIC AIRâFAIRY without. On yon Lake the Moon-beams playing, Thy Sire 'ere he his prime had seen; Near this spot benighted straying, Lost his life on Halloween. Malcolm armed, and vengeance swearing, Lead to Murther Ruffians dire; Who Assassin-like appearing, Bathed in blood, thy Saint-like Sire! Listening agitated, at the close of the strain, he draws his sword, and vows revengeâthen bursts into tears.âAlleyn, habited as a Scotch Peasant, enters, bearing a bundle across his shoulder; in passing on to the Cottage perceives Osbert, and, leaving his bundle at the door, approaches him. RECITATIVEâALLEYN. Weeps't thou brave Athlin's death? the story drear Of his foul murder, which I oft have heard, Adown my cheek, like thine, has forced a tear; Demanding vengeance on our Tyrant Lord! But see he comes! yon Cot will shelter yield, Retire awhile, thy efforts now were vain; Surrounding Vassals are the Monster's shield, Horror and Cruelty support his Train! Exeunt with Osbert into the Cottage. Enter Malcolm slowly, his eyes fixed on the earth, followed by Edric somewhat terrified, and armed Vassals. RECITATIVEâMALCOLM. Dire load of Guilt! how thou weighs't down my heart! To Dunbayne's Castle find some other track! (Perceives the Cross.) Accursed memento! leave meâhenceâdepartâ (To Vassals) This rude memorial's my eternal rack! (Strikes the Rock, from which blood issues, and crimsons his swordâEdric appears terrifiedâMalcolm continues.) WellâAthlinâthee I murder'd! and dare brave These throes of Conscience! I thy Pride abhorr'd! And could thy form, in arms, stalk from its grave, Again I'd meet thee with my blood stain'd sword. Stalks past the Rockâthunderâthe sky is darkened âthe Rock opens, and a figure in complete armour appears, pointing to his blood-stained wounds âMalcolm starts, terror struck! VOICES HEARD IN THE AIR. Foul Murderer! bewareâbeware! Blood will have bloodâthy Lot's despair! The armour drops from the figure, and a skeleton appearsâMalcolm shudders, reclines on Edric; who, from alarm, seems scarcely able to support himself âthe skeleton sinksâMalcolm recovers himself, and, striking his breast with ferocious dignity, exclaims!â RECITATIVE. Birth to new Vengeance does this warning give, Reminding me still bless'd thine offspring live! My slighted loveâagain with ardour warmsâ And pictures unenjoy'd fair Mary's charms. They must be mineâshe caus'd this deadly strife, Her proud refusal cost her Sire his life! Why dost thou tremble? (to Edric) bear thy Lord's command To Athlin's Castleâgoâclaim Mary's hand:â Which if again refusedâDestruction's breath Dooms Athlin's Clan to Dungeons and to Death. Exeunt. Enter Old Alleyn, Osbert, Alleyn, and Janet (his Sister) from the Cottage, gazing after Malcolm with astonishment. RECITATIVE. Old Alleyn. I'm glad they're gone!âthree times myself I cross'd! More scared by half than if I'd met a Ghost! Well, Heaven eyes all, and will sure vengeance take, Murder will out, when even stones thus speak! Alleyn. (kneel.) Baron of Athlinâpoor and lowly born, Let not a Peasant's offering meet thy scorn? Whose bosom pants for fameâwho covets scars, Impell'd by Justice in the Injured's cause. Accept my aid? Father, new scenes in view, For a short time we partâSister adieu. Osbert raises and embraces him, accepting, with thanks, his services, and after receiving his Father's blessing, and affectionately embracing his Sister, they exeunt. Old Alleyn and Janet returning into the Cottage. SCENE II. âAthlin Castle built on the summit of a Rock, its base in the Sea, by which two thirds of it is surroundedâa banner on the turretâ the entrance by an outer gate, to which a bugle horn is attachedâthe Moon still shining, and the Castle Windows transparent, with interior illuminations. Enter two of Osbert's Vassals, much fatiguedâ one sounds the hornâWarder enters through the gate to them, bearing a flask of wine and goblet, seems surprised at their return without Osbert, their lord! DUETâWARDER AND VASSAL. [1.] Warder. Ho! why dost thou quake? where's our Baron so bold? His absence has caus'd Joy's delay! Vassal. 'Tis bewitch'd HalloweenâSprites and Fairies I ween, Have our Baron bewitched away! Woe is me!âwoe is me! Have our Baron bewitched away! Warder. The Feast is prepared, gallant Chiefs in the Hall, This goblet I fill unto thee. Vassal. Tho' joy 'twou'd impart, grief so goads my poor heart, No joy has the goblet for me! Well-a-day, &amp;c. 2. Vassal. How shall I the Castle inform of our loss, How shall the sad story be told? Tears will start from each eyeâevery breast heave a sigh, And the blood of our Clan will run cold. Woe is me!âwoe is me! And the blood of our Clan will run cold! Warden. Come, sorrow is dry, drink, your bosom 'twill cheer, Drink an end, honest heart, to our woes! A cup of good Ale, will enliven thy tale, Vassal. With sorrow my Cup overflows! Well-a-day, &amp;c. They enter the Castle Gate. Osbert and Alleyn approach, the former welcoming the latter to his Castleâwinds the bugle hornâ the Vassals and Warder return, and, perceiving their Lord, sink at his feet in an extacy of joy. GLEEâACCOMPANIED BY THE BELLS. Alleyn, Vassal, and Warder. Sound, Warder, the horn, Let the merry bells ring; Gallant Osbert's return Revives us like Spring: Chearily, chearily, chearily! Every Year on this Night, With glad Harmony's sound; We to feasting invite, And the glass circle round. While our Minstrels sing, And our sweet bells ring, Merrily! merrily! merrily! Exeunt into the Cottage. SCENE III. âA grand illuminated Banquet Hallâin the centre a Gothic Canopy of State, under which are placed three State chairs, on two of which are seated Matilda and Maryâa band of music divided on each side of the Stage in correspondent Orchestrasâtables richly ornamented, and decorated with a profusion of Viands, Fruits, &amp;c. âThe Clan of Athlin discovered, Ladies attendant on Matilda, &amp;c. in various attitudes and situations. A flourish of musicâOsbert enters, introducing Alleyn, who bows to the Chiefs, is gladly welcomed âPrincipal Minstrel comes forward with golden flask and goblet. RECITATIVEâPRINCIPAL MINSTREL. Flow regal stream (offers it to Alleyn, who drinks) Minstrels chaunt forth the glee, Which calls our Clan to deeds of Chivalry. GLEEâMINSTRELS. Scotia's Champions bold advance, Wield the sword, the shield, the lance. Exert your might, In mimic fight: The Martial strain, the Clash of arms, To noble deeds the bosom warms! Combats with the broad sword, dagger, and sword and shield take place to music, in which Alleyn proves victoriousâOsbert presents him to his Mother and SisterâMary descends, dances a Pas Seul, at the close of which he kneels, and receives a triumphal scarf from her hands, and accompanies her to her seatâmusic soundsâOsbert snatching up a goblet in his left hand, and, drawing his sword with his right, comes forward, the Clan follows his example. RECITATIVEâPRINCIPAL MINSTREL. Brave Clan of Athlin join with fond accord To the memory of our departed Lord! They kneel and drinkâthe Castle horn is sounded, and Warder enters, followed by Edric, and the Clan of DunbayneâCarron bearing a standard with the following inscription: âMalcolm once more demands the hand of Mary.â Matilda and Mary shudder at the perusalâOsbert, almost choaked with rage, with a stamp commands Edric to retire, all joining him in treating the demand with contempt and defiance. RECITATIVEâALLEYN. Inform your Tyrant Lord, that Athlin's pride, By threats or promises rests unsubdued! High Heaven forbids his race shou'd be allied, To one yet reeking with a Parent's blood! Edric starts abashed by this reproof; but Carron, disdainfully turning the standard, displays the following threat: âDread Malcolm's Vengeance.â Osbert's Clan half draw their swordsâMalcolm's retorts defiance, and is led off by Carron, Edric despondently following.âOsbert, coming forward, kneels, and points his blade to Heaven, all follow his example. RECITATIVEâALLEYN CROSSING WITH HIS OSBERT'S SWORD. This be our sacred pledgeâhere we unite! And at our Gallant Leader's bold command; Impetuous will hasten to the fight! And drive the tyrant spoiler from the Land! Matilda and Mary take leave of Osbert and Alleyn during the following CHORUS OF THE CLAN OF OSBERT. Brave Osbert, Athlin's gallant Lord, The very flower of all his Clan; Thus boldly draws his Highland sword, To prove himself a Highland Man! In Tartain plaid, his Troops array'd, To curb the vaunting Foe unite; We scorn to yieldâhigh Heaven our shield, Will guard us in the thickest fight! Osbert and Alleyn, at the head of the Clan, march them off. SCENE IV. âAn Apartment; partly hung with Armour, in Athlin Castleâa martial Trophy in the centre. Donald and Archibald, one of Malcolm's Clan, enter warily, the latter displaying the following scroll: âMalcolm proffers Wealth to him who will place Mary in his Power.â Donald appears yielding to his wish, when the voice of Bella without alarms him, and they retire. âEnter Mary, followed by Bella and attendantsâ she mournfully throws herself into a chairâBella presents a bookâshe attempts to read, but, absorbed in love-fraught reflection, discards itâthe martial trophy attracts her eye, and she strives to wield a sword and shield, which, accomplishing, she turns over the correspondent armour, and, inspired with a desire to follow Alleyn and her Brother to the field, selects a suit, which she orders Vassals to follow her with, commanding Bella to remain there till her returnâ Donald re-enters, and pays court to her, but appears surprised at perceiving the dismantled trophy, &amp;c. and enquires the cause. RECITATIVEâBELLA. La Donald! can't you guess? 'tis as you see! We've quite ransack'd your little Armoury; With trusty broad sword, and in armour bright, Soon will you viewâoh! such a daring knight! 'Tisâ'tisâ'tisâmy young Lady! who gallantly swears, To follow him she doats on to the Wars; This is a secret tho', indeed it isâ I'd not divulge itânot forânotâa kiss! But Donald, be prepar'd, 'tis her desire! A Female Knight should have a Female's Squire! (significantly.) Prepare yourself, while I watch here resigned, Exit Donald. And hum the ditty that best speaks my mind! LIVELY BALLAD. [1.] Let Grey-beards teach which way is best Our time to be employing; Since Life is fleeting, I'll be blest With what is worth enjoying! Love's tickling throb my heart can feel, And Sweetheart's round me hie; Look silly, swear, and vow and kneel, Who cares? I'm sure not I! With a fal, lal, la! 2. I'm courted by our Vassals all, The Gay, the Grave, the Witty; The Maypole high, the Pigmy small, All vow I'm monstrous pretty! But for my Heart, each Love sick Swain, May languish, pine, and die; I only smile at all their Pain, Who cares? I'm sure not I! With a fal, lal, la, &amp;c. 3. Some call me pretty blue ey'd Belle, Admirers are so civil! And some, who say they love me well, A little wicked Devil! 'Tis true I am no haughty Miss, Will wed before I die; But should a Lover snatch a Kiss, Who cares? I'm sure not I.â With a fal, lal, la, &amp;c. Exit on the side Mary went off. Re-enter Donald, armed, cautiously taking leave of Archibald, who, forcing on him the bribe for which he is to betray his Mistress, takes his leaveâ after which, on the opposite side, Bella precedes her Mistress, arrayed in compleat armourâDonald swears fealty, and they exeunt. SCENE V. âA Romantic Waterfall. Enter several of Malcolm's Vassals, Carron at their head. DIALOGUE GLEE. Hush! hush! be mum! lay your ears to the ground, And hark to the Traveller's tread; Whew! (they whistle) let the signal go round! (the whistle is answered without.) 'Tis answer'dâour plans nobly laid! (Enter Archibald.) Arch. In disguise she approachesâher Vassals are bribed! All. To Malcolm we'll soon bear our prize! Step asideâstep asideâboldly seize Athlin's pride, Tho' tears dim her radiant eyes! (they retire.) Enter Mary, followed by Donald and Attendants, weary and faint; she awhile halts, and consults Donald on their future pathâin lieu of reply, he gives the preconcerted signal, and Malcolm's party rush forward and attack herâa pauseâshe vanquishes her assailants, but is disarmed by the traitor Donald, and they seize her. Fair one, you 'tis we seekâyour fate is decreed! Thus we bear you to Malcolm the bold. She extricates herself, and flies for protection to her attendants, who, following Donald's example, point their weapons to her breast. The tongue of an Angel, unheeded may plead When opposed to all conquering gold! Exeunt, bearing her off. SCENE VI. âCourt Yard of Dunbayne Castle. Enter Malcolm through an archway. RECITATIVEâMALCOLM. Love! Sovereign Fiend! proud Tyrant of the Soul! Tormenting Urchin, mocking Fate's controul!â (The bugle horn is sounded without.) But hark!âmy trusty Edric! 'tis his well known horn, Throw wide our Castle gatesâ (The Gates are thrown open, and Edric and a few followers appear crossing the Castle draw-bridgeâEdric approaches, trembling, dreading to make known Athlin's reply.) Mal. âThou shak'st with fear! Then Edmund speak (to another attendant) let me their answer hear! My generous proffersâ Edm. âThey reject with scorn, Misname you Murdererâdare you to the fightâ And Chief, behold Looking out through the Castle Gates. Like burnish'd gold Their glittering Armour beams upon our sight! Mal. (Reflecting) A moment's pauseâ'tis suddenâlet me seeâ Valour is oft the Dupe of Treachery. AIR AND CHORUS. Softly beat the hollow, hollow drum, Tap a tap, a tap, and row, dow, dow; 'Twill cause around me my Champions come, Their Chief's commands to know: Tap a tap, a tap, and row, dow, dow! (His Troops surround him to the tap of the drum.) While the draw-bridge remains, the Foe 'twill deceiveâ Nor bar our Castle Gate with too much care; But when once enter'd, prepar'd to receive, Enclose, and drive them to despair. Thus boldly arm'dâto ambush hie, To the tap a tap, a tap, of the hollow drum! The signal that calls to Victory, Is the alarm bell's brazen bomb! bomb! bomb! All disperse to their lurking placesâthe bugle horn, trumpet, &amp;c. heard without, and shouts of Osbert's party as beseigers.âOsbert and Alleyn burst open the Castle gatesâin the act of commanding their Clan to follow, the alarm bell sounds, the Dunbayne Clan rush from their concealment, drive Athlin's back, and close the gates on Osbert and Alleyn, who are assailed by Malcolm and Edricâ Alleyn subdues Edric; but, flying to the assistance of Osbert, is vanquished by Malcolm, and both are made prisoners. RECITATIVEâMALCOLM. (exultingly to Alleyn.) Striplingâin gloomy murmurs mourn thy fate, Thy beardless Chieftain, where dire horror reigns, Like thee indignant shall regret my hate, Like thee unpitied clank his galling chains! (Alleyn and Osbert embrace.) But join our Clan, and thine be wealth and power, Destruction or renown await my breath!â Ere the deep bell toll ONE (thy number'd hour); Prepare to join us, or to sink in Death. Alleyn. Then Death be Alleyn's portionâhe defies It's keenest pangs, and for his Chieftain dies! Osbert and Alleyn again embrace, and are borne off to separate DungeonsâMalcolm draws Edric aside, gives him a dagger, and points to Alleyn's Dungeon, exclaiming âStrike Home.ââEdric, bewildered with terror, is approaching Osbert'sâ Malcolm detains him. Mal. Hold! a respite Mary's Brother shall receive! But Alleyn DIES, or Edric MUST NOT LIVE. (Exeunt, their eyes fixed on each otherâa tremulous vacancy in Edric's features, and a determined ferocity on Malcolm's.) SCENE VII. âA Dungeon in Dunbayne Castle âa pendant Lamp burning, and a bed of strawâ an Iron grated door to the Dungeon. Alleyn discovered leaning against the wall mournfully. RECITATIVE. Strange! strange vicissitude! with Hell in league, Malcolm bids Innocence, and Virtue weep! My Spirits sinkâfaint with the days fatigueâ I seek refreshing aid from balmy sleep! (Throws himself on the straw, and gradually reclines to rest.) The grated door is opened cautiously, and Edric enters, full of terror at the murder he had undertaken, in one hand bearing a dagger, in the other an hour glass.âHe approaches Alleyn, perceives he sleepsâ prepares to strikeâAlleyn heaves a deep sigh, and his resolution failsâMalcolm appears, upbraids his tardiness, and, pointing to the hour glass, tells him with its departing sand must flow the life-blood of his Prisoner, and, commanding immediate dispatch, departs, closing the grating after him.âEdric again approaches Alleyn (who continues still in a sweet slumber) again uplifts his dagger, and again remains irresoluteâthe bell tolls one, his signal to be briefâ he appears determined, more resolutely prepares to strike, but melting into tears, dashes the dagger from himâAlleyn, arouzed by the noise, starts up, places himself in an attitude of defenceâEdric draws âAlleyn seizes his sword hand, overpowers him, obtains it, and dashes him to the earthâhe solicits mercy. RECITATIVEâALLEYN. An unarmed Victim, base 'tis to assail, But take my lifeâ'tis now of poor avail. Returns Edric the sword, who, overcome by this act of heroism, falls at his feet, and bathes them with tearsâAlleyn raises himâhe, wildly, snatching up the hour glass, recollects their dangerous situation, and attempts to burst the grated doorâMalcolm exclaims without:ââThe Hour is past!â Edric attempts in anguish, with his sword, to force the flinty walls.âÃrial music, and a vocal strain to the following effect assails their ears: Pursue thy efforts 'till some secret spring A prospect of sweet liberty shall bring. Alleyn snatches up the dagger, and striking the centre of the Dungeon, the solid Rock disappears, and discovers the Fairy, seated on a Cloud, who points to a subterraneous pass, at the back of the scene. AIRâFAIRY. The hollow dell, the circling lawn, Shall glad thine eyes ere blush of dawn: Fair Freedom's path pursue; The humble shall exalted be, âVirtue is true Nobility!â Adieu, brave Youth, adieu! Fairy still pointing to the passâthey proceed, on her waving her wand a blue flame lighting them through it!âwhen they go off, the scene resumes its original appearanceâthe door of the Dungeon is heard unbarring, and Malcolm rushes on with his sword drawn, starts agast, and enraged. RECITATIVEâMALCOLM. Escaped!âfor this was my revenge delay'd! Ring the alarm bell!âtreason!âwe're betray'd. Exit. SCENE VIII. âA ruined part of Dunbayne Castle, supposed to be the exterior of the back part of the Dungeon in the former Scene; a private door, half hid by Ivy and surrounding Weeds, leading to it. Enter Malcolm's party, dragging on MaryâCarron dispatches one of the Clan to inform Malcolm of his approachâa bugle sounded on one side of the stage, answered by a trumpet on the otherâ fearful of losing his prize, Carrol attempts to force the door, and procure a receptacle for his Prisoner âMary makes an effort to escape, but, rudely prevented and threatened with destruction, screams! âthe door is suddenly burst open from the interior, and Alleyn and Edric rush forthâa pauseâAlleyn, perceiving a supposed youthful Warrior enthralled, attacks Carron, whom he vanquishes, while Edric drives off his followersâMary, rescued, faints in the arms of her deliverer, and, her helmet dropping off, discovers whom she isâa shout of exultation withoutâEdric returns with Matilda and Vassals bearing presentsâMary, recovering, solicits pardon for her elopement, presenting Alleyn as her preserver âMatilda raises and embraces her. RECITATIVEâMATILDA. Thus to a Mother's arms a Child restored! Thanks gallant youthâbe Providence adored! I seek the Tyrant's presenceâwealth I bring, For Osbert's ransom, might redeem a King! Thy prayers, thy tears shall aid a Widow's plea! (To Mary.) And make e'en Malcolm yield to Clemency! Exeunt. Enter Old Alleyn and Janet. RECITATIVE. Old Alleyn. Off! off again in spite of all my cares! To risk his life once more in Athlin's Wars! AIRâJANET. My Alleyn is brave, is the pride of the Vale, His breath than the Hawthorn more sweets does exhale; The Sun's deepest crimson his lips do outvie, And dark as the Sloe is his black rolling eye. His Crest than the Charger is bolder by far, His proud swelling heart defies danger and scar, And soon wing'd with Fame he'll return from the war. My heart chill'd with fears when he bid me adieu! These eyes filled with tears, as he sped from my view; The dark day of combat, ah! ne'er let them see, His life-blood if spilt is a death wound to me. But his Crest, &amp;c. Exeunt. SCENE IX. âThe Castle of Dunbayne, to which a draw-bridge, over a Lake, is affixedâbetween the draw-bridge, and the entrance into the Castle, which is through an archway, space enough for a platform, able to contain three or four men at one periodâa strong barred Casement, and door looking oblique-way over the Moat, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Enter Alleyn, Matilda, and Mary (in female attire) followed by the Clan of Athlin. MUSICAL DIALOGUEâAlleyn, Malcolm, &amp;c. Alleyn. On the errand of Peace, Dunbayne's Castle we salute. Soundâsound the hornâswell the trumpet's strains. (A Parley is sounded, and answered, Malcolm approaches) Mal. Cease, Clarions, cease, (to the band) At your humble suit, Appears the Lord of these rich domains! Mad. An imprison'd Son demands a Mother's tear, Where! where's my Boy? Mal. âCommand the Youth appear. (Osbert is brought forward chained and guarded.) Mal. Hardgalling chains! be still, proud swelling heart! Thy injur'd suppliant, trembling bends her knee; With all our Castle's wealth we'd gladly part, To gain lov'd Osbert's life and liberty? (Malcolm raises them with apparent kindness.) Mal. His life, his liberty, thy prayers command, Bless but the Donor with fair Mary's hand! Sign this fair instrumentâ Offers a scroll for signature, on which is inscribed: âTo save a Brother's life, Mary consents to become the Bride of Malcolm.â Alleyn, Matilda, and Mary read the scroll with horrorâOsbert boldly urges them to leave him to his fateâMalcolm presents Mary a pen, haughtily demanding her signatureâirresolute she casts her eyes around; her Mother shuns her looks, her brother meets them with a frown, while Alleyn seems lost in absolute despairâoverpowered with agony, she, trembling, drops the penâMalcolm exclaims: Mal. Dispatch your Prisonerâ(she implores him) my command is past! This instant shall the stripling, Osbert, breathe his last. Mat. A moment's pauseâjust while he breathes one prayer. Mal. You know his ransomâ (Malcolm again presents the pen and scrollâMary signs.) Alleyn. âAlleyn's lot's despair. (Malcolm receives the scroll exultingly, and exclaims to his guards) Mal. Release our future BrotherâMary's charms Must now bid cease the rival clash of arms! Osbert is brought over the draw-bridgeâMalcolm presents the scroll, and bids his guards release him âOsbert dashes them from him, and tears the scroll! âMalcolm's Clan, on his signal, seize, and point their weapons to his breast; Matilda and Mary kneel. RECITATIVE. Mat. One hour's delayâe'en half that period's pause, To dry our tears, and forward your design; A Mother pleadsâ'tis in her Children's cause, Grant her request, and Mary shall be thine. Mal. Her whining plea awhile my rage beguiles, Departâand when the Sun renews his course; My promised Bride restore to me with smiles, Or view in death the mangled Osbert's corse. Osbert sullenly takes leave, is marched over the draw-bridge, Malcolm, &amp;c. followingâMatilda and Mary mournfully depart, followed by their Clanâ Alleyn remaining, absorbed in melancholy thought. Enter a Fisherman, followed by Edric, their attention is arrested by the voice of Osbert, singing in the Tower. âDeath would come like a friend to release me from pain! âMust I never see Alleyn, my Champion again?â Alleyn appears much agitated at this mark of his affectionâgazing round, perceives Edric and Fisherman, in the latter recognizes an acquaintanceâEdmund, as Centinel, parades the platform in front of the Tower. RECITATIVEâALLEYN. The drowning Man will e'en at shadows catch! Hush! Edmund o'er our valued Chief keeps watch. DUET. Alleyn. Ho! Edmundâbrave Centinel my whisper'd thoughts receive! The Tyrant you serve is humanity's bane! The murderer's service 'tis virtue to leave, Your aid to brave Osbert may freedom regain: Ah! think on beauty's tears, nor let your heart be steel'd. Edm. Tho' danger's form appears, I to your wishes yield. When in yon Tower a beacon blaze you see, Think near at hand your Chieftain's liberty. But hush, I hear a footstep near, Some furlongs off await With anxious care, 'tween hope and fear, In silence watch your fate. Both. With anxious care, 'tween hope and fear, We'll silent watch our fate. Alleyn and Fisherman retire on one side, Edric on the otherâMalcolm and Carron approach Edmund cautiouslyâthe latter seizes him. RECITATIVE. Mal. Ah! traitorâhave I caught thee! wretch abhorr'd! Seek somewhere else Humanity's reward. (Stabs him, he falls into the Moat, leaving his cloak.) I'll give the signalâFortune on us smiles! Lower thou the bridgeâwe'll catch them in the toils! Exit. Carron puts on Edmund's cloakâthe signal appears at the watch-towerâCarron lowers the bridge âEric returnsâCarron beckons him to cross it, he compliesâCarron assails him, is defeatedâhe breaks open the Tower, and releases Osbertâthe alarm bell is rung, the bridge drawn upâMalcolm rushes on, and seizes OsbertâAlleyn and Fisherman, in the latter's boat, row towards themâOsbert disengages himself from Malcolm, and, leaping off the platform, is received into the boat, and they rapidly direct its course under the draw-bridgeâGuards rush to seize Edricâhe plunges into the Moat, and escapes by swimmingâMalcolm and his Clan group on the draw-bridge, turrets, &amp;c. and the scene closesâthe distant shouts of Osbert's Clan enlivening the fall of the curtain. END OF THE FIRST PART.</field>

The Feast is prepared, gallant Chiefs in the Hall, This goblet I fill unto thee. Vassal. Tho' joy 'twou'd impart, grief so goads my poor heart, No joy has the goblet for me! Well-a-day, &amp;c. 2. Vassal. How shall I the Castle inform of our loss, How shall the sad story be told? Tears will start from each eyeâevery breast heave a sigh, And the blood of our Clan will run cold. Woe is me!âwoe is me! And the blood of our Clan will run cold! Warden. Come, sorrow is dry, drink, your bosom 'twill cheer, Drink an end, honest heart, to our woes!

      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE I. A handsome Gothic Apartment in Athlin Castle, adorned with a portrait of Mary; in the centre of the Scene folding doors leading to her Apartment. Enter Alleyn, he gazes, enraptured, on Mary's portrait, and sings. DUETâALLEYN AND MARY. Alleyn. Maryâangelic Maid, Doomed to adore thee! Hopeless Youth's Roses fade, Death! I implore thee! Sprung from an humble Cot, Proud renown seeking; In secret to sigh's my lot! Love, my heart's breaking! Mary replies from her apartment. Love onâbut love in vain, Fond youth, I hear thee; But Birth bids me Worth disdain, Mary can't cheer thee. Highborn, in splendid state, Humble joys seeking; In secret to sigh's my fate, Loveâmy heart's breaking! At the close of the Duet the folding doors open, and Mary, timidly, approachesâhe throws himself at her feetâshe raises him, takes a bracelet from her arm, adorned with her miniature, and presents him âhe kisses it with rapture, and affectionately presses her hand to his lips; while thus situated, Osbert enters on one side the stage, and Matilda on the otherâthey start, and the lovers appear confusedâ Osbert, frowning on Alleyn, half draws his sword. RECITATIVEâMATILDA. Alleynâmy heart acknowledges thy worth, Thy bosom's anguish painfully I view; But honor bids us not degrade our birth, Her thanks, but not her vows to thee are due. Matilda and Osbert lead Mary off. Alleyn despondently fixes his eyes on the scarf he had received from Mary at the banquet, and, seating himself at the table, inscribes on it, âFarewell for Ever!â AIRâALLEYN. One lingering look 'ere yet we part?â Ah! no, 'twould but deceive! This last sad token of a broken heart, Despondent thus I leave. To combat Love, how vain is Man's endeavour, Farewell! bright vision! ah! farewell for ever. Throws the scarf on a table underneath her portrait, and exit.âA trap door in the stage is uplifted, and Donald and one of Malcolm's chiefs ascend. RECITATIVEâCHIEF. Thus far our hopes succeedâsee yon pass clear, Hush! hush! (looking through the door) our prize approachesâdisappear!â(they conceal themselves.) Mary re-enters, starts on perceiving the scarf, and bursts into tears; in the interim, Donald and his companion steal from their concealment, and the trap-door again slowly opening, others of Malcolm's Clan ascend, and, cautiously proceeding towards Mary, seize her.âDonald blows out the lightsâshe screamsâthey bear her off, one in the struggle depriving her of Alleyn's scarf.âOsbert enters alarmed, with his sword drawn, is attacked by those who remain, and wounded; but as he falls (endeavouring to seize the Ruffian whose sword had pierced him) snatches the scarf of Alleyn, and the Ruffian escapes! âMatilda, Edric, and Osbert's Vassals rush on with lights, Edric catching Osbert as he falls.âOn examining the scarf, they recollect it to be Alleyn's, and are thunderstruckâMatilda rushes into Mary's apartment, and returns more confirmed in her suspicions. RECITATIVEâMATILDA. This scarf! her absence! my dear Child is fled! My shatter'd brain yields to this mental storm; My eye sight fails (still gazing on the scarf) by Alleyn thus betray'd, So black a heart within so fair a form! (She faints, and is borne off, all following mournfully.) SCENE II. âThe Cloisters of a ruined Abbey, overgrown with Ivyâan archway backed with Ruins; under the archway an appearance of shelter from the weatherâshattered Ruins practicable over it, from an ascent through the arch. Malcolm enters musing. RECITATIVE. These tardy minions! yesâthey must succeedâ The subterraneous pass they have secure! That, Mary must be mine, fate has decreed, I'll meet themâthis suspence who can endure? Exit. Enter two or three Monks of St. Andrew, bearing dispatches for Alleyn; principal Monk gives them to a Brother, pointing out the path he is to pursueâ the second Monk goes off the side on which Malcolm had made his exitâthe other on the oppositeâ a storm commences.âEnter Donald, &amp;c. dragging on Mary, to shelter themselves, they enter the archway bearing her out of sightâthe remainder kindle a fire, and are sitting down to regale themselves before it, when Alleyn wildly entersâa scream from Mary arrests his attentionâhe demands the causeâ they answer him with their drawn swords.âMary rushes forward on the Ruins, over the archway, followed by Donald, with an uplifted daggerâEdric darts on, perceives her danger, and, while Alleyn is engaged with his assailants, ascends the Ruins, and attacks DonaldâAlleyn, having vanquished his opponents, flies towards Mary, who leaps into his arms, Edric stabbing the faithless Donald.âAt this period Osbert and his Clan enter, and perceiving his Sister in the arms of Alleyn, enraged, draws, and commands him to defend himselfâAlleyn discards his weapon, and bids Osbert strikeâMary throws herself as a barrier betweenâOsbert drops his sword âEdric brings on Donald wounded, who just retains sufficient strength to exclaim: âAlleyn is Innocent.â Which he confirms by an appeal to Heaven, and expiresâOsbert embraces Alleyn, when Old Alleyn and Janet, almost breathless, enter, he bearing a rich casket. DUETâOLD ALLEYN AND JANET. O. All. Where, where is young Alleyn! my wits are scared, I've ran so fastâI'm near out of breath! Janet. My Brother he asks forânoânoâ'tis a Laird, Whom near expiring he sav'd from death. O. All. The story's long; but it must be told, One dreadful eve did the tempest roar; The rain beat hard, and the wind blew cold, And a stranger tapp'd at our Cottage door. Janet. A Lady enter'd all rich array'd, A tender Babe in her arms she bore; He. That I wou'd protect him earnestly pray'd, Begged secrecyâsigh'dâand spoke no more! Long since 'tis many an hour has flown! I rock'd the Bairn full oft on my knee; Had him Alleyn call'dâhe thriv'd as my Son, She. And Alleyn he proved a good Son unto thee! He. This Casket stored with many a gem, When twenty years he had pass'd and a day; The Family Tree of which he was a stem, I solemnly vow'd I to him would display. Kneeling to Alleyn he opens the Casket, glittering with costly gems, from which he draws the following scroll: âThe Owner of these Jewels is the wronged Heir to Dunbayne's Domains.â Osbert embraces him affectionately, joins his hand to Mary's, and all exeunt exultingly. Malcolm gloomily re-enters with a wounded Vassal, from whom he learns Donald's and Mary's fate âthe Monk of St. Andrew returns, having lost his path, and addresses Malcolm. Monk. To Athlin Castle I this packet bear, Bewilder'd in my pathâsay, is it near? Malcolm appears elated, a thought seeming to strike him, that the Monk's habit will forward his views!âentices him under the archwayâdispatches himâand, as he groans, rushes forward with the packet and his habit, &amp;c. in which he arrays himself. RECITATIVE. Mal. This be my passport to weak Osbert's dome, Hate nerves my arm, and Vengeance bids strike home! Exit. SCENE III. âOutside of Athlin Castle. Enter Matilda and Attendants, exultingly meeting Osbert, Alleyn, Mary, Edric, &amp;c. whom she welcomes home; Edric gayly introducing himself to the Vassals, whom he orders to be merry, capering himself, half frantic with joy, by way of example.â Malcolm enters in the Monk's habitâstarts on beholding Edric, who, not knowing him, intimates his aid is necessary in the Castle to conclude a Wedding, and invites him inâMalcolm enters the porch with fiend-like exultationâall the characters follow, but the Minstrel and Bella, who come forward and sing. DUETâMINSTREL AND BELLA. Min. The Monk of Saint Andrew religiously moves, A Wedding his errand, so solemn decreed; Bella. 'Tis solemn, but link'd to the Laddie one loves, One wishes the Priest soon to finish the deed. Min. But the honey-moon once o'er, And tired the pair with clishmaclaver; Jock his Jenny loves no more, Auld nick for him might have her. Bella. But still a Wedding's full of glee, Bright eyes it sets a glancing! Reels and Strathspeys merrily, We at its close are prancing! Both. But still, &amp;c. Bella. Man, our glum Lord and Master so sullen appears, 'Tis Wedlock alone can his feelings improve; Min. The sweet smile of Beauty Affection endears, That heart's not worth having that's callous to Love. Bella. Vide Burns.âLovely Woman, Nature swears, âAmong her noblest work she classes; âHer 'prentice hand she tried on Man, âThen form'd usâpretty Lasses!â Min. Love's pleasing union teems with glee, Bright eyes, &amp;c. SCENE IV. AND LAST. âA Gothic illuminated HallâVassals of both sexes discovered bearing banners of the House of Athlin. Enter in procession Matilda, Osbert, Alleyn, Mary, Old Alleyn, &amp;c.âthey range in orderâafter which Matilda embraces Mary, and Osbert raises Alleyn (who had knelt) and embraces himâEdric enters, whimsically introducing Malcolm as the Monk of St. Andrew, who, dispensing blessings round, proffers his services. RECITATIVEâMATILDA. 'Ere Beauty's smiles reward the hand of worth, The mystery proclaim of Alleyn's birth. Old Alleyn unlocks the casket, from which he takes a scroll, on which is written: âIn Alleyn ye behold the rightful Heir to Dunbayne, deprived of his Parents and Possessions by the murderer Malcolm.â Malcolm startsâEdric eyes his agitation with apprehension âAlleyn gazes astonished! RECITATIVEâALLEYN. Then Malcolm dies! this shall my title prove (drawing his sword). And conquest own me worthy of thy Love! (to Mary.) MATILDA. Stay Alleyn, 'ere the happy hour is flown, This Holy Priest shall link two hearts in one; Freeing her forfeit hand from Malcolm's power! The Marriage ritual is proffered Malcolm, who, dashing it from him, with an uplifted dagger in each hand, attempts to stab Alleyn and Mary. RECITATIVEâMALCOLM. While Vengeance thus presents their Wedding dower! (Osbert snatches one from him, Edric deprives him of the otherâMalcolm throws off his disguise.) Behold that Malcolm who in Fate's despite, Seizes this forfeit hand, his dearest right; Who slew thy Father (to Alleyn) thine (to Osbert) lives the World's foe, And wreaks his vengeance thus onâ Draws his sword, and rushes on Alleyn, who parries his thrust, and dashes him from him; as he is on the point of renewing the attack, Edric stabs himâhe falls, groans, and diesâFairies suddenly appear, and the characters form an interesting groupe. FAIRY. Thus perish Viceâgay Revelry's bright Queen Bids Mirth dispel the gloom of Halloween. An appropriate Dance takes place, and A PAS SEUL BY MISS CABANEL. FINALE. Janet. When Fortune smiles, a fawning train The rising Sun bedazzled view; To him chaunt forth the venal strain, Their own aggrandizement in view? Fairy. But Virtue yields a genial glow, Tho' from Obscurity, we find, Oft snail-like it emerges slow, It leaves a shining track behind! Min. Gay Minstrels sing, pipes sweetly play, Auld daft Misfortune's said her say; Each bonnie Lad, each cannie Maid, Now join our norland Roundelay. Bella. The honest heart shou'd ne'er despair, The captive hope to freedom see; The longest lane a turn has ta'en, And grief yields to felicity. CHORUS. Then ne'er again may grief be seen, Our promis'd bliss to intervene: But friends be found in all around, And welcome give to Halloween. THE CURTAIN FALLS. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DUETâALLEYN AND MARY. Alleyn. Maryâangelic Maid, Doomed to adore thee! Hopeless Youth's Roses fade, Death! I implore thee! Sprung from an humble Cot, Proud renown seeking; In secret to sigh's my lot! Love, my heart's breaking! Mary replies from her apartment.
