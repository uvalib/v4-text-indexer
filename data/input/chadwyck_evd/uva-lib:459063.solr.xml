      <field name="fulltext">SCENE PISA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Castracagnio, Florello, Ariotto, Soranzo, Lizaro. Florello. Your Troops have skirmish'd at the North Gate, and Are return'd without much loss. Cast. Mistakes are ever incident to night, And darkness. How long is't since The Sun appear'd? Flo. Not a full hour. Cast. Death! We have flown hither then, we have Out-march'd time, 'tis strange we should reach the Town So early, and find success absent. Piracco hast thou summon'd 'em to a Parley? Enter Piracco. Pir. Twice noble General. Flo. The Governor appears upon the Walls. Enter Governor, Colonel, &amp;c. Gover. Hail Castracagnio, the Great Dukes General, We wish both health and honor to Florello too, Your Lieutenant o'er this powerful Army. Enter Foscari. Cast. My Lord Foscari, this is Court breath, sweet And subtle, we that follow the War, know not how to Disguise our meanings; how Come you to bestow upon us such pleasant Greeting, and yet affront our Master. Fosc. We do invite a penalty from Heaven. If we cannot justifie our Deeds. The Great Duke of Tuscany is allowed to be a Man Of Honor, we implore his friendship, And shall grow proud to gain it, but 'twill deprive Our Fame of Courage, to become his Subjects, When without impeachment to his title, He may esteem us his Confederates and Allies. Cast. You are revolted from a State, that hath Power to shew their Justice, till Your repentance comes. Col. Twice have we sent to Florence for redress Of injuries, received from those of Luca, And could ne'er procure an audience. Old men Contain in their remembrance, that our Signiore of Pisa, scorn'd to implore Justice from any State in Italy. Cast. Is this the cause of your revolt. Fosc. My Lord, the people are incens'd against their Oppressors, your burthens gall their shoulders, Which they'll fling off for ever now. Cast. You shall know the intent of my Commission. I must demand an easie entrance here, Attended with a Regiment of Foot, These to remain a Garison, till my Master receive less cause to doubt your Faith's. You, my Lord, to become my prisoner, And all we shall find adherent to your faction. Fosc. This a new oppression, but we are Able to resist it; there is not a heart In Pisa that can out-live his Honor. Our suffrance will make us Martyrs. Cast. You are hold Rebels, and must expect The cruelty of War. Col. We know your strength, and the justice of our Own cause, your threats deserve our scorn. Flo. With leave of my right noble General, I demand leave to speak. My Lord Foscari You know what the fury of a War commits, Deserve the Dukes mercy, with your own, upon Your Countrey, grant our demands, and cherish Peace. Appeal to Florence, think upon the power we Lead, let the teeming Mother sleep quietly Within her Husbands bosom, and her young Issue live till they requite her groans: Let the aged pay their Death to Nature, And the Virgin dedicate her self To Hymens holy use; for Soldiers have No Mercy in their Lust or Anger. Cast. We are not wild in Peace, nor tame in War. What with gentle words we proffer, if now Refused, wil be deny'd you when the storm Grows rough and boisterous. Col. You have good hopes, but we can ne'er be guilty Of dispair. Fosc. My Lords, it gives us cause of grief, that your Charity and noble wishes cannot Receive our thanks: You see The inconvenience of vast attendance, You come hither with such full Troops, we dare Not entertain you in the Town, you must Be pleased to lie i'th'Suburbs; pray take heed Ye catch not cold, leave our Sconce, y'ave a full Hour given you to depart in safety; When that's expired, be sure you are beyond Our Cannons reach, Colonel away. Exeunt. Cast. Death, do they mock our kindness! I'll continue a Battery upon the Walls of Pisa, till Our shot lay their Walls level with the Earth: Pira. A Battery, a Battery! Liz. Heaven preserve our General! Ari. Amen! For he preserves our Swords, they shall Not rust for want of use. Cast. Florello ere we mount all our Cannon, 'Twere fit you guard the River with your Horse, Till the Redoubt there be finished. Flo. I've some kindness still for Pisa, I wish t'would yeild without inforcement by Our Battery. Cast. What sayest thou? Flo. But your will deserves to be performed. Cast. Dost thou not wish us to revenge this scorn. Flo. I think that man would merit much from Heaven, Whose patience can have leisure to Prevent Ruine, and gain the Town by Treaty, With a Composition noble. Cast. Th'art my wonder! In all Assaults Thou wert ever violent, thy courage Rather rash then slow to meet the greatest danger. Pira. A Battery, a Battery! I love Danger, a long Winter siege is Letchery to me. Ari. A Battery, a Battery! Cast. Florello, thou dost conceal thy thoughts, why art So silent? Flo. Be not displeas'd Sir, if I beg you to remember, Heaven Delights in soft compassions. In the Town Are many goodly Structures, and glorious Temples, sacred to the fame of Saints. Cast. Thou leav'st my thoughts unsetled, I'll call A Council: Piracco, give speedy notice Toth' Marshal o'the Field, that he perfect Our Entrenchments, and be diligent to Expect new Orders. Pira. Which he might have chosen one without An Imposthume to deliver his Errands, I'm ill appointed for a Race. Exeunt Castracagnio, Piracco. Sor. My Lord, I'm bold to revive my suit. Flo. I shall include it in my next Conference With the General, and give you ample cause To praise my care. Let me see you Often in my Tent. Exit Florello. Sor. You do engage the utmost strength of all My love and service. Thou art exactly Valiant, a just friend unto a Noble Enemy. How temperate he was in what Concerned the Generals fury, he has Some reason in it, although disguised. Ari. With your consent Sir, are you not a Member of our Faction? Sor. How! Y'are no Banditi Gentlemen, A Faction in the Camp? Ari. Art not a Voluntier? A spark derived From a flame of Triumph, a Child of Pride, And loud Glory? Dost not thou as well as we come to The Wars to gain noise? Hah! let's be particular; Begin acquaintance, love, and friendship! Sor. This is a sudden way, but 'tis believ'd That friends are scarce, when men are so greedy To gain them. Liza. Do you know him Sir. Sor. I shall do ere I'm a minute older: He will be known. Liza. Repent your sin. Sor. How? Liza. A fortnight since, 'twas my error not to Know him, but my fate grew kind; in our march From Florence, he was mingled in a side With me, I survey'd his forehead, found out His merit by instinct, proffered friendship, 'Twas granted, Amity increased, and since That time he hath revealed himself to be a Lad of mettle; All fire, the true Image of Amadis De Gaule his Ancestor. Sor. This fellow has a rare nimble Tongue, He speaks all and more then he knows, ere I have Leisure to hear a part. Ari. It appears by this private Conference, You are acquainted with Lizaro: Sor. Is he call'd Lizaro? I thought I should Know his heart sooner then his name. Ari. Sir, your counsel'd by a friend, there's danger In his presence. Sor. I hope he wears no charms About him, Key Guns or Pistols charg'd with White Powder. Ari. There's danger in his Vertues, in his parts Of Merit. Sor. This is strange! You mistake me sure for Oedipus, I'm no Expounder of Riddles. Ari. The Colonels and Officers o'th' field Avoid him with like haste, as they would Chain-shot. Sor. Why, good Signior? Ari. They are eclipsed with his presence, as lesser Lights before the Sun; his valor drowns the voice Of Hannibal and Scipio, he hath Increased the number of the Worthies, his name Makes 'em up Ten, you may see it i'th' last Impression. Sor. You should do well to write each others Annals, They would make Voluminous Books; and this Language seems rarely in the Epistles Dedicatory; for there 'tis frequent To belie men with praise. Shall I intreat My absence. Ari. Not yet for your Souls health: How chance you made Not us, your great examples before the General? Sor. In what Sir? Ari. Did you not hear us make a noise, pronounce With accent loud, A Battery, a Battery. Liza. Sir, you must learn to make a noise, whilst you Remain i'th' Camp; we are Voluntiers, we Hang Captains, Officers, all such as trail The limber Pike for pay: We come toth' war For Fame, Honor is our pay: Ari. When you are skilful how to make a noise I'th' Camp, you may be priviledged to roar I'th' City; to wear a Lock o'er your left Shoulder, large as a Horses Mane. Sor. Sir, my affairs deprive me of the rest Of your instructions, I would hasten My departure. Ari. First leave your name behind you. Sor. I'm call'd Soranzo. Ari. If we did know your Tent, you should receive A visit from us. Sor. Y'ave learn'd where the Lieutenant-Generals Regiment is quartered. Ari. By perfect demonstration. Sor. There you shall find my Tent. Liza. Dost know Piracco? Sor. I've heard of Captain Piracco, he has A ripe Imposthume in his Thigh: He was Here now with the General Ari. The same, Pox on him, I saw him do good Service at the Battel of Lepanto. I was loth to see the Rascal foundred, Whilst this Arm and short Blade could rescue him From Seven Firelocks Liza. That was the time you catch'd the Bullets In your fist as they flew about him. Ari. No, that was at Millan in a skirmish Against the Grisons. Dost know Meruole? Sor. You mean, Ensign Meruole the Duellist. Ari. No matter for his title, we call each Other by the corruption of our names, Tom and Dick: 'Tis a blunt garb, but it Becomes Soldiers. The Slave is famous in Duels, he has proffered at us too; but We keep him at distance with a certain reverse. Observe me Sir, with a punto sublimato That is raised by your neither guard, present Your weapon naked. Enter Meruole, Piracco. Liza. 'Slight! Here they are! End your discourse. Ari. I shall attend you at your Tent. Sor. These are rare Blades! Exit Soranzo. Mer. I'm as melancholly, as an old Witch Over a smoaky fire. Pira. Is all thy money fled? Mer. I ha'not a Ducket left to buy food: Upon a march my stomach grumbles at noon, And sickens at night. Pira. These Limbs did never spred and swell thus with vacant Meals. Mer. 'Tis a Pennance prescrib'd by my Confessor, I must live my days upon the smoak of a Match. Pira. And thy offence is want of Meat. Mer. I ne'er thrived since I grew proud, since I Tore the Taffeta from my Colours To line my Doublet. What are those? Pira. 'Slight, my Subjects! Meruole stroke Thy heart, use it kindly: I'll give thee cause To desire long life. Ariotto, take Your hand from your Pocket, I must substract From my Exchequer. Ari. Death Captain, What do you mean? discover Us before a stranger. Liza. This is contrary to our Covenant Signed at our last Court-du-Guard. Ari. So Captain! lengthen your discourse, D'ye not See him hearken? Pira. Be as private as you please, but my want Decrees it, I must visit my Exchequer. Ari. It is Lizaro's turn now, I disbursed Last time. Liza. I could consent to reason: This is Tyranny To demand it before a stranger. Pira. I shall bore you, if you Endanger my Imposthume. Lizaro presents. So I'll be modest, these four Duckets shall Suffice me at present. Meruole bring Thy person near us. Mer. I like these morning Exchequers rarely. Pira. I resign Ariotto to thy use: He is thy Tribute. Ari. Captain, you mistake us, we have not more Patience then belong to Mortals. Liza. By this hand, plain tyranny! Mer. Subject, I come to levy my last Tax; Nay no Rebellion, you see my Iron Scepter. Ari. By this Light, Ancient! This is a meer jest, A device of mirth, usual 'tween Piracco And us: Captain, what do you mean, will you Betray our Purses, and our fames? A meer Just 'faith Ancient! Mer. Good wits! Break these jests as often as You please, I'll take 'em in earnest, I. Nay, nay quick, permit my easie search, Unless you have an appetite to taste my steel. Ari. Well! The sturdy Oak must bend, when the Devil Rides by in a Whirl-wind; we'll write an Indenture, Which when you have sign'd, my Purse-strings are untied. Mer. An Indenture! Pira. I, I! It onely concludes thy promise, Never to reveal thy self their Pensioner, Nor them cowards Mer. This I consent to gratis. Ari. Well, when you have sign'dâ Mer. How, it shall be sign'd after Dinner, You must disburse the tribute now. Liza. By this Day, he should not have the ninth part O'th' three and thirtieth corner of a Doit, Ere he had sign'd. Mer. No Signior, you'll make a Novice o'me! A City Heir! I must sign at all hours When you please, my Steel is ready. Ari. Nay, nay, good Ancient, hereâuse me kindly, The less you take, the more remains for your Future service. Mer. I will be temperate, the slave does keep His Purse so warmâoneâtwoâwhorson Mungril, ThreeâfourâfiveâMust they enjoy this pretious Earth Whilst Men of merit fast, till their lean Bones Fret their skin outâsixâsevenâeightâI, eight Duckets, There keep the rest till I call for't. Ari. Death! y'have pillag'd me, the Purse is empty! Mer. Which way can you sufficiently reward The merit of an old Soldier, Dogâ You Voluntiers are no more to us, then Bulrushes to Pikes, or Pikes to May-Poles. Ari. Hell swallow me, if I could not find in my heart To be valiant. Liza. O Tyranny, Tyranny! Pira. Hast thou not cause to bless me, beside this Daily tribute, I take my choice of both Their Wardrobes, when my own grows aged. Mer. Do'st thou hear Subject? provide me against To morrow night seventeen: Let me see, I, I, Seventeen Duckets more. Mark me Subject, This I demand as love moneys, I shall have Speedy use of Tribute. So farewel Good loving subjects. Ari. We shall live worse then Bores In Germany. Exit Ariotto, Lizaro. Mer. Piracco, I'll feast thy Corps at Bagolas, She boils good Bull-Beef, and I long to cease The noise in my stomack. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Foscary, Colonel, Bertolina, Ranola. Foscary. Long ere this time we did expect a Battery, 'Tis strange they are such quiet Neighbors. Col. The Outworks are made perfect, and our River Guarded by a Sconce, no force of Cannon Nor Humane courage, can indanger us, Unless we betray our own strength. Fosc. Colonel, your reward will be immortal fame; You have oblig'd your Countrey to hold your Name precious; and 'tis my ill fate To wear a title that grows too heavy For my strength, I stagger beneath its weight. Col. Your own deserts, and popular love, made you The Governor of Pisa. Fosc. How unsafe is it to keep that honor; This Siege informs you I'm made the mark, at which the Great Duke Doth aim his fury; and howe'er 'tis noble In a Soldier to presume on destiny, And his own courage; yet it is wisdom To suspect danger ere 'tis felt. See Bertolina Already like a Captive, shews she hath A melancholly look, she's no more my daughter, But the child of fortune. O my lov'd Girl! The Sybils faces do resemble thine, Thy look doth prophesie, but yet not a Kind fate. Bert. Sir, your Stars have a great predominance O'er my Nature. Fosc. There is a cause that justifies this grief, How would it hasten thy eternal absence From this World, to see thy aged Father Fetter'd with Chains, and thus To be sent to Florence, there to beget nothing but Scorn and laughter in the Duke. Bert. O Sir, do not mistrust your power with Providence. When you speak thus, I tremble like a tender Lamb, In a cold Winter night. Fosc. 'Las! Why should this beget thy fear? Though my Offences expose me to this danger, Angels will secure thee; but what, My Bertolina, wouldst thou suffer to Prevent this sorrow. Bert. The Rack, Famine, or Fire, Or any torment Sir, to preserve you. Col. Had Portia ne'er been known in story, thy Heroick vertue had wanted an example. Fosc. This joy on Earth, will tempt me to affect Mortality. Shall we yield my Girl this Proud City to the Dukes disposure, And so procure thy safety? Bert. Never! Life affords no pleasure when once We are depriv'd of Liberty. Though Men Of low and humble Birth, account it no Restraint or bondage, unless their Limbs are Fetter'd, or circumscrib'd with Walls; yet such As boast of high descent, esteem their honor Wounded, when they lose but a little; which Courage or resistance might have kept. This Is a glorious cause! Women may fight In this just War, And not impeach their modesty. Fosc. O such a child was Nestor's fam'd receipt, With which he did restore his youth, I shall Out-live my memory, until I have Forgot my name. Enter Soldier. Sold. Noble Governor, the Senate are in Council, and wait your presence. Fosc. I come: Colonel, yield not to a Parley, We will endure this storm, and save the City. Farewel my Bertolina. Exeunt Foscari, Colonel, Soldier. Ran. Madam, must we then expect a Battery? Bert. I Ranola Will it not make rare Musick? Ran. These Cannon Pellets will bruise me shrewdly. Bert. They are curs'd i'th' Womb, whom the Cannon murders; Therefore for the credit of your Stars, do not Suspect a death so boisterous. Ran. When the Battery begins, I'll hide my self I'th' Matted Closset, and shut the Wainscoat Door close, then I am safe Bert. Thou may'st as well wrap thy self up in Silk, And think it proof against a Musket Bullet. I left a Picture in your charge, prethee Bring it me down to the Gallery. Ran. I shall Madam. Exeunt omnes. Enter Ariotto, Lizaro, Bagola. Ari. Quick, good Bagola, our stomachs are so keen, We shall need no Knives. Bag. I boyl no flesh, but what is wholsome. Ari. Good Camp Beef, if't be thy will. Liza. And that's Horse-flesh in the City. Enter Soranzo. Bag. O Signior Soranzo! I have reserv'd A morsel for your Paunch, will make it heave. Sor. Prethee hasten it hither, I chue my Cud already. Ari. Signior Soranzo, sure Fortune has Received her eye-sight; is she so kind To send you hither. Sor. Death! Must I always meet with these Earwigs; How they endanger my Brain. Bag. Here, devour a pace, I have no Vinegar. Ari. I ha'seen thee wash thy Aprons in this Bowl, Why dost thou bring our Meat in't. Bag. By Jove they were my Smocks! feed And be thankful, the Ram was somewhat tough I kill'd to day, but you shall have it. Exit Bagola. Ari. You shall share in our Mess. Sor. I shall be excus'd Sir, and thank you Liza. Ariotto, the Maiden-head of this flesh Is thine; this day thou didst deserve it by Feats of valor. Ari. Had I not seen thee engag'd against the Other five, I had maintain'd the combat still With those Seven Switzers, Pox o'their two handed Sithes, it were easier for'em to cut down An Oak then me, whilst I stood at this guard. Liz. Right, but t'was for the safety of my fame To see you skirmish with twelve such, And not employ my fortitude to weaken Their assault. Can you accuse my fury? For I beseech you, let us borrow your Moderation. Sor. In what Sir? Ari. 'Faith would a had seen thy magnanimous Feats, Lizaro, he would have gain'd employment For his Pen; and thanks from all posterity. Liz. Nay, nay, Troth thou dost abuse thy own merits. Nine o'the twenty, ow their lives to thy Mercy. Sor. This is new Court thrift; they are not able To maintain flatterers, therefore belie Each other, with their own praises. Enter Meruole, Bagola. Ari. 'Slight! There's Meruole, hide the Meat. Mer. What Food Bagola? Bag. I'll cram thy Maw with Beef of Roaring Bull. Mer. With Horses flesh, stew'd i'th' Water of a Ditch. Bag. Ancient thou beliest my hospitality. Mer. Prethee vanish, &amp; fetch a morsel hither. Bag. What dost thou grumble. Mer. I say, a haunch of thee is more in season In the Camp, then Venison in the Court. Bago. Your morcel shall be visible streight. Exit. Mer. There's my subject, I smell an Odoriferous steam. Ari. He has got the scent, we must speak to him. Ancient, how does thy Lungs, thy Mid'rife, and Thy Bladder, ha? Mer. Room for my eye-sight, nay, I must see it. Ari. Before a stranger. Ancient remember Our Covenants. Mer. Sligh you are, Cannibals do lay Meat there to affront my nose; but I can smell you. Ari. If you resolv'd to forfeit your Bond, yet Let's feed together. Mer. Not so much as will choak a Wren. Liza. Part of it belongs to my disbursment, And I'm Piracco's subject. Mer. I'll borrow of Piracco for this time. Liza. Tyranny, Tyranny! Ari. Death! Be not so loud; since we must suffer, Let's disguise it from Soranzo. Welcome 'Ifaith Ancient, imploy thy Teeth until Thy Gums are sore, it was provided for Thy dirty Maw; thou shalt not leave the weight Of an atome behind thee, devour it all. Mer. Devour it all! Subject are ye turn'd Traytor Have you a plot to kill me with a surfeit. Ari. Nay, good Ancient, before a stranger! Liza. 'Twas onely spoke to disguise our frailty. Mer. That breath cools my spleen. Sor. This is a rare Tyrant. Ari. Death, he observes us, give us leave to talk For preservation of our honors. Eat Good Ancient, 'tis a usual complement With us, we'll expect the Relicks. Liza. If y'are destitute of a Knife, here is A young Bilbo, 'tis neer a kin to old Bilbo my Sword. Mer. I shall eat; bring some Wine hither. Enter Bagola with Wine, Bread, and Mutton, &amp;c. Bago. Here's your morcel Sir, it may be given A Queen in Childbed, what are you furnish'd? Ari. Meruole is our guest, give him some Wine. Mer. Here Bagola! Here's t'th' prosperity Of thy ravenous stomach! Bago. Thanks Man of War, I am call'd within: I am Roasting of an old Cat. Exit. Ari. Ancient feed on, we must retire, Marshal Affairs deprive us of thy smooth looks; would Cerberus were feeding on thy heart. Liza. We must grow valiant, this tyranny is Above humane suff'rance. Ari. Signior Soranzo, we wish you well. A way, our cowardice is yet conceal'd. Exeunt Ariotto and Lizaro. Mer. Whoreson Monkeys, shall they surfeit here, feed at Nero's rate, whilst Men of merit dine with The Camelion. I have A politick noseâ,'twill wind out a steam From the Mogol's Kitchin, to the Turks Parlor. A health to you Sir. Sor. Sir, I receive it as an honor. Mer. By this Light, you eat nimbly. Sor. I hope Sir, you do not number my Bits. Mer. No Sir; but if you continue at this rate, you Are a rare Trencher-man. A ha! This will comfort the Kidneys, I would know your Countrey Sir. Sor. I'm a Florentine, Sir. Mer. Your name shall be most welcome to my ears. Sor. Sir, we lose time in pratle, this hour Belongs to the stomach, not to the tongue. Mer. S'death he out eats meâAnother health Unto your person. They both drink. Sor. I'll give you satisfaction Sir. Mer. I'll engage, if thou hast so good A stomach to the Wars, as to thy Meat, We shall need no Weapons but thy teeth; thou wilt Eat up all our enemies. Both rise. Sor. Sir, I shall do my poor endeavor, being Encouraged by your example. Mer. He's a Voluntier, if I could make him pay me Tribute, 'twere a good addition To my revenue. I'm much taken With thy person. Sor. I have cause to cherish it, since you find it So deserving. Mer. Thou do'st so charm my eyes, I am not able To resist my purpose. I must, spight of My teeth, do thee a kindness. Sor. Pray Sir, believe it then, You shall find me grateful. Mer. I have drunk fillers, he tempts me by Conjuration, 'tis grown inevitable, I must do it; go, go, be confident. Sor. Sir, I would gladly know your curtesie Ere I receive it. Mer. Lend me thy earâ I'll fight with thee. Sor. You merit my eternal service. Shall I be bold, to think I may enjoy This honor. Mer. 'Heart do! I consume my breath, Did not I say be confident. Sor. I, but the kindness is so eminent, I fear a rival; some other man abler In desert then I, may strive to gain it. Mer. Here is my gage to assure my promise. 'Tis not My custome to oblige every stranger With such indeerments. Sor. Nay Sir, I have certain Himns to sing ere night, Unto my Stars in thanks of it. Mer. Dost hear, when I have flesht thee with this Mettal Of Toledo, thou maist justle the General, And spit in thy Colonels face, yet remain As safe as in a Tower of Brass. Sor. Troth 'twill be a rare priviledge. Mer. Am not I Meruole? Who dares bestow His wrath on him, whom I accept in Duel? Sor. Well Ancient, I shall presume. Mer. Go, go! Be proud, I'll do't, I like thy person. Sor. Heaven preserve ye Sir, I have just cause T'insert you in my prayers. Exit. Mer. I shall try his Mettal, if he be Fit to be wrought on, I'll not stand idle, He may make a subject too. Bagola. Enter Bagola. Bag. What say'st thou Demogorgon? Mer. How do'st thou call this voluntier? Bag. Soranzo, the Imp is liberal, He paid this Silver for his food. Mer. He must pay me tribute too. I am His Soveraign, at our next meeting he takes The Oath of Allegiance. Here give this t'Ariotto, Tell him my Relicks should be sacred to A Coward. 'Twere not superstitious To eat 'em kneeling. Bag. But when shall I number my seven Duckets. Mer. Death! I must pawn him here: When he returns, say 'tis My pleasure he remain thy prisoner Till he have paid it. Bag. He pay your debts! Mer. I, do this, or increase your tally still; Score up, and pay your self with your own Chalk. Exeunt. Enter Castracagnio, Florello, Piracco. Cast. He numbers in this Letter three hundred Waggons of Corn. Flo. Sir, the whole Convoy is cut off, and with small loss Of our own Troops. Cast. Here's new intelligence much pertinent. He gives us notice they expect relief From Mantua. We command the River. Flo. And so guarded, 'twill prove of small Advantage to their hopes. Cast. Then Florello, I still shall magnifie Thy temperate soul; thou hast preserv'd Pisa From falling into Ashes, each structure There stands as a Piramid, to eternize Thy noble mercy. Flo. Sir, I am ecclips'd by the glory of your Merits. Virgins shall sing your praise, and the Matrons of the City, commend your kindness In their prayers to Heaven; they will now yield Rather then suffer famine. Pir. So whilst they learn to fast, we learn to sleep. This Discipline is new in War, Pox on't, 'twill be A long Siege, I shall grow mangy. Cast. Piracco is a great enemy to his Imposthumes, he would expose it to all Unnecessary danger. Flo. It is his policy to use it ill; For so he gives it no encouragement To stay by him. Pir. When you have use of a Surgeon, you will grow Less witty. Enter Soranzo. Flo. Your attendance serves aptly now for your Affair. My Lord, this is the Gentleman I did commend unto your knowledge. Cast. You have made him a Captain in your own Regiment. Sir, ask for your Commission From my Secretary, it is already Sign'd; and expect all other favor I Can shew you. Sor. Your Excellence hath oblig'd my love more Then my duty. Enter a Gentleman. Cast. Ronaldo so soon return'd from Florence. Gent. The Great Duke salutes you kindly 'tis his Pleasure you peruse these Letters. Cast. This directs it self to you. Follow me And share i'th' knowledge of what mine imports. Gives it Florello. Exit. Pir. I must go seek my Subject. This War affords no other pillage, but His substance. Exit. Florello reads the Letter. Flo. Hah! You cannot seem cruel to this Faction, 'Tis our will you hasten your Battery Against Pisa The Duke deprives me of Immortal fame, I cannot now be merciful, Pisa is proscrib'd for ruine. Sor. My noble Lord, would I could share in this Your suff'rance, though't be unmannerly To enquire your grief. Flo. O Soranzo, hast not perceiv'd of late My eyes ecclips'd. Methinks my grief doth so Exactly counterfeit decrepit age, The Fates should think me old, and make this night My last O 'twere a kind mistake. Sor. Sir, however you disguise your sorrow With inforc'd mirth, from publick notice; Yet friendship hath a subtler perspective, I am more curious in discovery of Your health, and find your thoughts perplex'd and scatter'd; If the cause could find a remedy from My assistance, I would beg to know't. Flo. 'Twere guilt in thee to know't, thou art pure As Chrystal, I shall stain thee with my breath. Soranzo, I must hide my self. Sor. My noble Lord. Flo. My absence may beget a wonder, Until the cause of it is known; but then My name will infect our Language, blister The tongue that speaks it, O! I shall be lost To every good mans memory; this night I do begin My Pilgrimage, I enter in a Path Like that which leads to the habitation Of the dead, from whence I never shall return. Sor. How, my Lord? You have left me guilty of An ignorance that may indanger me for ever. Where will you hide your self? Flo. In shades of night and darkness. Sor. You cannot hide your self from me, for as The Diamond you are light unto your self. This darkness makes you seem more bright to me. Flo. Your inquisition is too strict; leave me To wander with the wind; if in my absence My honor is accus'd, reserve thy charity For a nobler use, then to defend what Is so tainted. Sor. How can your honor (the pattern which I Imitate, and think th'ambition lawful) Deserve an accusation? Flo. Soranzo, thou art young, but newly known To war, and glory; the way that leads to Honor is intricate. O I must Commit a sin that will indanger all Those wreaths my Brow hath merited. Soranzo, 'Tis thy fate to undo me with thy friendship, For thy help must hasten my perdition. Sor. My help! Dismiss me strait, Forget you ever saw me, rather then Reserve my friendship for a use so horrid! Flo. No more: Thou hast betray'd me with thy skill, Obscurely crept into my Brest, and seen My black thoughts. Be sure that you Reveal it not to the Air, What thou hast tempted from me, I impart Not to thy ear or tongue, but to thy heart. Exeunt.</field>

Sor. You may: The power is great y'have o'er my love And duty, or I ne'er could be seduced To do you this service. Sir y'are not kind To me, you still conceal the cause that doth Engage you in this new strange adventure. Flo. Waste not my last Sute, that thou wouldst leave me To the protection of my Stars. Prethee Be not guilty of too much love, thy care Is to inquisitive. Sor. This enterprise is dangerous to your fame And person. Flo. Soranzo, mind thy own affairs; I cannot die i'th' dark, Prethee leave me. Lies down. Serg. We walk in danger Sir, they made This night three sallies from that part. Exeunt. Flo.

You are to loud, if thou give the alarum To the Town thou dy'st, yield up thy weapon. Perd. As I hope for mercy, Sir, 'tis not worth Your acceptation, dull Ammunition Blade, as I'm a Soldier. Flo. Howe'er, resign it for your own safety. Perd. Well Sir, I cannot deny you so small A kindness, but 'tis not worth your wearing. You'll give me good quarter. Flo. To what part of Italy dost thou ow thy Birth. Perd. Not far of, I was born In Pisa. Flo. How! the name of Pisa doth oblige my Kindness, lead me thither; here's thy Weaponâ I'll become thy prisonerâ Perd. Sir, are you in earnest. Now I have my Sword again, I shall grow very angry If ye mock me. Flo. My request is serious. Perd.

Am not I thy Soveraign? Ari. Good Ancient, be pleased but to consider, I Have not the Indies, nor the Philosophers Stone To assist my disbursments. Mer. I know my own Prerogatives: Thou art My Subject; my necessities increase in time Of War, and I must levy Subsidies. Lizaro, you'll hasten your accounts to Number me out just Thirteenâ Liz. I'll be a loyal subject. Piracco Is my Soveraign: Pay tribute to a Foreign Prince. Mer. Well Gentlemen, ye shall eat my Sword up, Ye have Ostridge stomachs, I know ye can Digest Steelâ Ari. Well, how much must we disburse? Mer. I'll have all that remains in your possession, Ye shall not keep a cross to swear by. Ari. Pox upon you! The Tyrant of Siracusa Was not so envious to Men. Mer. D'ye snarl ye foysting Mungrels. Ari. 'Sdeath, you can but have your tribute brought home To ye: There 'tisâLiesure, we must obey. Liz. I am pleased. This tyranny will soon o'ercome My Nature; my gentleness is not long liv'd. Mer. I love mettle of this complection: Are your Duckets full weight? I'm decreed, If ye cheat me with light Gold, to leave your Souls Naked without a skin this frosty weather, D'ye observe my precious Mounkies? Ari. 'Tis a great vertue to be patient. Mer. So, if I can increase the number of My Subjects: I may have hope To be a Captain, this age is grown Sinful; we can get no titles, but what We pay for. Soldiers were never happy, Since the siege of Troy. Good Agamemnon, I'll trail a Pike under thy Ghost, if it Would walk, and bear arms. The Court infects The Camp, we must be gaudy now; triumph In Scarlet, and high PlumesâThis Hat looks like An old Morrion 't has been my Pillow 'bove Eighteen years. Just of Methusalem's BlockâHa!

Sir, I grieve you must lose your industry, I pray peruse the other on my left Thigh. Pira. How Caitiff? Dost thou so much neglect life, To walk without aurum potabile, Without Tribute, to appease my wrath. Liza. Sir, I know you can speak thunder, 'tis in Your power to kill me with your voice; but yet Take leisure to consider. I pray Question Meruole, your Colleague i'th' Empire. Ari. A Man Captain (if it be lawful to whisper) More barbarous then a Goth; the Vandals Were not so ravinous when they sack'd Rome, As he in pillaging of us. Pira. Preserve our stations, least when I grow Angry, I hurt ye with my breath Ancient You are not temperate. Mer. How Captain? Pira. You insult upon my kindnesses, and 'tis Difficult to grant your pardon. Mer. By this fair Light! If you Incense me, I shall trouble ye worse then Your Imposthume: Can you not gull the State Finely, muster up Ammunition; Cassocks stuff'd with straw; Number a hundred forty nine dead pays, And thark Heaven for your Arithmetick? Cannot you cloath your ragged Infantry With Cabbage Leaves? Devour the reckonings, And grow fat i'th' Ribs, but you must hinder Poor Ancients from eating warm Beef: Hence forth Expect no Contribution from these Bores. Pira. S'death! Will you not permit me to enjoy one? Mer. I will have both. Pira. That's to be decided with our weaponsâ They draw. Ari. Pray Lizaro, if they both die, our Bonds Are void, and we are free. Mer. D'ye curvet!

Ari. Now I am victoriousâ Piracco down. Lizaro, your Champion's foil'd. Mer. Captain, thou'st still been held a bold Soldier, I'll not insult o'er thy unkind destiny, Live still; but by my Stars, you must either Give me your Sword, or disclaim all interest In these two, they are my Subjects now. Pira. Yield up my Sword, no! Take 'em, cherish the Babes; Keep 'em warm, they are very chilly. Mer. Quick! Do me homage, bow lower? Ari. This is but humility. Liza. We are exceeding vertuous. Mer. Piracco, give me thy fistâWe'll have a truce. Pira. Pox upon you, y'ave still the better on't In these skirmishes. Mer. How now? No more a Cripple, thou walkest as Stifly as a stock. Pira. Hah! I do not limp! By this Light, thou hast launch'd My Imposthume! Mer. Hey! I near thought I had skill in Surgery Till now; march on quick to my Colonels Kitchin Tent, I'll present thee as a miracle; A little of the Cooks Balsamum Will finish the cureâBy this hand he walks upright! Subjects both attend. Ari. Every man gains by quarrelling, but weâ Exeunt omnes. Enter Foscari, Florello, Colonel. Fosc. We embrace the greatest Soldier The World contains; so far you have obliged Our Gratitude, we fear we shall discredit Nature; for Man was ne'er predestinate To so much power, as can requite your Noble Charity Col. Ye shall find us always prompt to serve ye, And faithful, as becomes our Births and Calling. Flor. I have chosen to perform this strange duty, when time Makes me most useful; you are shortly to Expect a Battery. Fosc. We are enabled to resist the storm; Heaven hath provided us some friends amongst Our greatest Enemies: However, we are Begirt with Intrenchments, We can receive from Florence safe intelligence, And speedy. The news of this your Battery, Inforced with the Dukes stern rage, came to our Knowledge, before your relation Flor. Then Spirits are your Messengers? But I consume these hasty Minutes: Is't your pleasure to direct me To the Chamber, where I may finish That employment which seduced me hither. Fosc. Sir, I am proffering my attendance: Colonel give the Perdue a fair reward for this Great fortune, and conceal Florello's strange arrival. Col. I go, we have now gage To assure our safety. Exeunt omnes. Enter Bertolina, Ranola, with Florello's Picture. Ran. Madam, shall I place it here? Bert. Gently Ranola, had it sence, it could Not more provoke my care, I fear I shall Commit Idolatry? Hail great Soldier! Thou that art The pride of Italy, and so exact A wonder in this age; our Chronicles Will fear to Register thy Deeds, lest they Endanger quite the Readers faith to all They write. Why art thou absent now? Thou art imploy'd in atchieving new Wreaths, Ere the old are Wither'd, such sacred Garlands the Olympick Wrestlers won. Still he treads the Path of Honor And loud Glory: He never thinks on me I shall grow wild with grief. Enter Foscari, Florello. Fosc. Sir, I will leave you to express your thoughts Unto my Daughter. Exit Foscari. Bert. Secure us Heaven! Ranola quick, convey the Picture hence, My contemplations sure were sinful; still He remains to accuse my Idolatry. Ranola, is't not a Spirit? Ran. Madam, I can't think he is a spirit; A Maid may feel him without any Bodily danger. Exit. Flor. She is more timerous in her wonder Then I am. My Bertolina speakâ I hasten to be absent. Bert. Oh my Lord, if Pisa Be not vanquish'd, how come I t'enjoy you here? Flor. Our true loves began by often Enterview, when this proud City stood loyal To my Dukes prerogative, hath betray'd My soul to infamy and danger; yet I repent not my atchievement, I've gain'd More then will requite my losses, and I would Hazard all that's mortal, ever thus to Fetter thee with my embraces. Bert. Yet in my joy, I am most passionate, The Marigold so opens to the Suns Bright Eye, as Bertolina to your wish'd Presence; and had I longer been depriv'd Of your arrival, I had wither'd to my Grave. You should have found me sleeping in my Tomb, Cold as the Marble is. Flor. This I fear'd! Prophetick fury brought me Hither. I left my Countreys Causes, a just War; My title in the Camp, and the Soldiers loves, To fight for thee. Bert. How Florello, I hope I do mistake your language. Flor. My General securely sleeps, and dreams not Of my absence. Bert. Then you are now revolted from your Prince? Flor. I could not enough indanger my fame Or life for thy safety. Bert. Oh thou art lost! Lost to eternity! Flor. How! My Bertolina! Bert. Mourn all that love the Wars, your Ensigns make Of Cypress now. Florello's dead to honor. Flor. Stay, or I shall grow wild, I would not have My soul entic'd through my fond ears. Repeat your former words, If I have given you cause of rage, speak it In rougher accents, yet still wear in your Memory the cause of my revolt: 'Tis for Your sake I suffer. Bert. For my sake! The cause of your revolt is The sad reason that must enforce me to Disclaim your heart. Flor. Stay, you are too hasty in your sentence, Collect your thoughts, and do not thus requite My bold obsequious love. Bert. Thou stumblest like the blind; thou canst not see Thy fall: Heretofore we lov'd with honor And ambition; resolv'd to make our issue Glorious, but now thou hast destroy'd that hope. Why should we strive to increase posterity, Since our Off-spring must needs be disfigur'd With thy stain. Flor. 'Tis in thy mercy to absolve my sin, My honor I'll redeem with noble Fortitude. Bert. Never! The bold Warrier that hath deserv'd Fame, whose Deeds engros'd All publick noise once feel'd; his victories Are quite forgot, and he degraded from The rites of honor. My heart shall share in this Thy sufferance, I'll weep Till I am blind: Th'art now the ruines of A man, though heretofore, the noblest Soldier In the World. Exit. Flor. Hah! Never more redeem my lost honor! Can the vertuous sin with less presumption Then the impious? Are all my Trophies Forfeited for one rash error, And that provok'd by love? Know cruel Virgin. Hah, is she gone? She has left me mad, as The Northern wind in Winter storms. I must Pursue her, and enforce her to Relent. O harsh, harsh destiny! Exit. Enter Castracagnio, Meruole, Lizaro, Ariotto. Castr. Not in his Tent? Mer. No Sir. Nor in our Trenches, nor in our Horse Quarters. We have sought him with Spectacles And a dark Lanthorn, yet cannot find him. Castr. Thy mirth is troublesome, I'll not smile to day. Florello, where art thou hid? How ill it does become Thy title to affect corners, Unless by a strange ambush captivate, Or slain by some dire instrument of War. I cannot guess a cause t'excuse thy absence, I must delay the Battery, till I Do hear of thy return, or death. The love I ow thy merit, makes me suspect with fear. Exit. Mer. Florello is the favorite o'th' Camp, He will be mist with much sorrow. Subjects, Are the Articles written, I'll subscribe To nothing that may infringe my Prerogative Royal. Ari. We onely want your Marshal fist to Sign it, and some lawful witnesses To confirm the Deed. Mer. Piracco shall subscribe as a witness. Liza. Y'ave lanch'd his Imposthume to good purpose, He walks upright now. Enter Soranzo. Mer. Do ye hear Subject, I would not be gul'd Like a young Heir, I must read my Indenture ere I sign. Ari. There Sir, 'tis a kind of Hierogliphick. Sor. My heart begins to tire. Sir I'm bold To intreat a kindness from you. Mer. Hah! He does not look like one would borrow Money. Sor. I have some encouragement to hope well from your own promise. Mer. I lend no Money but upon Mortgage, Iâ Sor. You mistake my errand. Mer. I'm glad of it, Sir. You look like a Voluntier; there's a couple of your own tribe. Deprive me of sleep, I cannot steel a wink In forty hours for 'em, they dwell like thunder In my ears. Proclaim their necessities Louder then Cripples in the High-ways, and I'm tender hearted, I cannot deny 'em alms. Ari. Ancient, we are thy Soveraign Peers, and thou Our Subject now. Mer. Hark Sir I must obey. Sor. My demand requires not so much Tyranny, I onely beg you would be pleas'd t'exchange A Thrust or two in earnest, whilst you Sir Remember the Glove, I remember your promise. Mer. A new Subject, Heaven help me from The Gout, I begin to grow wealthy! Sor. So Sir, your answer should be noble. Mer. I am thinking what part of thy Body to Murther first. Sor. Ye exceed in Curtesie; but no doubt Heaven will teach me to be thankful. Mer. I will not hurt thee when I prick thy heart. Sor. Oh y'are too kind. Mer. To make out sport lawful, Ariotto Shall o'ersee our motion, I chuse him My second. Ari. 'Death Ancient, our new Articles exempt Me from all Duels. Mer. The Articles are not yet sign'd. Sor. This Gentleman says he's descended From Amadis de Gaule; I cannot wish To chuse a man more noble for my second. Liza. We shall ne'er be quiet, till Marshal Law Admit Suits in Actions of Battery. Ari. Fret thy Gums in private, we must haste. Sor. Nay, I beseech you Sir, it is my pride To be your follower. Mer. I do not love to waste my time. Sor. Sir I should disgrace my breeding, Pray march, I'm your humble Servant. Mer. If I prove victorious, I shall return Your complement true. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Bertolina, Florello. She gives him a Ring. Florello. Is this all the Favor? Bert. 'Tis a great one I'th' state you are in, so quit the Town Without more hazard: You ow me much, That I have studdied your departure, which To a person of your quality, were Not to be expected. Flor. I'm rewarded. Bert. You may live Florello To purge the sin of your revolt, and be Set glorious in opinion, who are now Left in a dull Eclipse. I would not have Our Chronicle, remember Bertolina Accessary to the death of your fair name, When the amazed Reader will in pity. A Tree so full of Blossoms wither! You are here out of the Suns true warmth, Return and prosper. Flor. Cruel Bertolina! I see thou art a Rock to Wrack th'unskilful Marriner upon, hast thou disclos'd thy Stony nature, when first my unhappy eyes Admir'd thee, I had steer'd another way, Or got some other Star to sail by. But Condemn me still, I'll call home my own thoughts That straggle from my reason, to joyn with Your accusation I confess I'm faln Into a depth, hath swallowed up my honor; And that which makes my suffering infinite, The love of a frail woman led me to my ruine. Farewel. Bert. Deliver that to the Colonel. Flor. If thou be constant to thy temper, get Betimes upon some Battlement, and See me made a Sacrifice, and too late check Thy pride, when my last breath shall scorn Thy name, but expire in prophesying thy unkind fate. Exit. Bert. I have been too passionate, And thoughtless of a common danger, I begin to find it. Enter Governor. Gover. Bertolina, where's Florello? I was told you were in conference; I hope your wisdom will direct you to Cherish his design, beside his noble Thoughts to you; for this great act, he's one Pisa is much engag'd to. Bert. I foresee a storm. Gover. Florence hath treasured up Great hope in him, and Castracagnia The General, with less hazard might have Parted with half his Army. I counsel Bertolina, That as you had power to draw him to our side, So manage him, he may be encouraged T'employ his love to Pisa. Bert. Sir, from you I learn'd to admire goodness, that Gives the distinction to Men; without This, I behold 'em but as Pictures, which Are flourish'd with a Pensil, to supply The absence of inward worth, their titles Like Landskip gracing them onely afar off. Gover. Thou hast my genius to instruct thee; All thy thoughts are noble. Enter Colonel, Ranola. Bert. The Colonel. Col. 'Tis done Sir. Gover. What? Col. Florello. Gover. What of him? Col. Is discharged. Gover. Ha! Col. By your command, he is dismiss'd the Town. Gover. By mine! Col. This is my warrant. Bert. Ranola th'ast undone me, didst not tell him I had something to impart. Col. I did Madam, but you see the unhappiness. Gover. Bertolina! Bert. Sir, your pardon; 'tis I must own the fact, yet hear me. Gover. Art thou turn'd conspirator? Bert. But late you thought me worth your praise, for Honoring vertue, which we cannot truly, But we must hate the contrary. Florello Was sick, my Lord, and my sending him hence, Was to procure his health. Gover. Astonishment! Is the morn elder by an hour since He convers'd with me, I discover'd no sickness in him! Bert. To me it did; I saw him Laboring with a disease, did fright my very soul. Gover. Give it a name. Bert. An Hospital has none So full of horror, he has an Ulcer growing Upon his fame, made him appear full of Deformity: Shall Foscari's Daughter Cherish a man that comes to court her love, Spoil'd of his honor? When he has washed, the stain Contracted by revolting hither, I'll Look on him with glad eyes, and call him lover Till then, I shut him from my thoughts. Gover. As I Will Bertolina, from my sight, I could Devorce thee from my Blood, and disclaim all That pleads for nature in me: Take her a way, Confine her ere she speak again, and tempt me To forget my self. Hath your nicety Betray'd so rich a hope as Pisa had In a few minutes? Hence, or I shall make Death the punishment of your stay. Carry in Bertolina. Col. My Lord. Gover. Be glad your error hath so good a Plea, You had been lost else. Tell me Colonel, Dost not expect Florello will return Circled in a flame, melting our Walls for This affront done by a giddy Woman? Col. We may joyn fire to his, but Sir, your noble Daughter. Gover. Do not beget suspition, Thou hast practis'd I reason with her, she is Too near me, we all suffer; and in this Pisa shall see my Justice. Exeunt. Enter Meruole, Soranzo, Lizaro, Ariotto, in the Field. Mer. Hang Physick, that prescribes the Spring and Fall, For opening of a Vein for the health of Honor. I'th' Dog-days we may bleed, or i'th' depth Of Winter. Here's an exc'lent place. How many ounces wilt thou spare Soranzo? Thou shalt bleed physically. Sor. I thank you Sir, you are a noble Surgeon, I'll not limit you art, I've your promise, To employ it to my honor. Mer. We'll fight the French way, shall's? Liza. The French. Ari. I never try'd that Duel. Sor. We must abide it. Mer. Let's to't Pelmel then. Liza. Pox a this Pelmel, I was in hope they would have kil'd one Another opportunely, and given us Leasure to think on't, I have it, I'll let fall my Sword. Ari. Remember then. Mer. Soranzo, tell me where I shall hit thee now. Sor. Let your skill direct you. Liza. Now I forget thee Ariotto. Ari. But howsoever remember to let fall your weapon, I am now thy enemy; guard thy heart, remember The reverse. Mer. Pox a thee, how dost thou fight, here, canst not Hit me here? Make a Punto. Sor. You must have patience. Mer. 'Death, what a child th'art, do encounter With a Pigmey, put home thy Bulrush, I'll Cleave thy Teeth Button, prethee fight. Pox a thee, how thou liest? Ari. Heart, your Rapier justled my Ribs, let fall; D'ye long to see Crimson? Liza. 'Tis against my will, as I am a Christian, I cannot let fall yet with honor. Ari. I bleed! Liza. Are you in earnest? Mer. How now? Sor. Does your arm ake? Or have you the cramp In your fingers? Mer. I cannot govern my weapon, thou hast Prick'd my wrist; where learn'd you This Surgery? Pox upon these Rapier-Bodkins, I cannot fight. Sor. I may take my leave then, Morrow Ancient, You have oblig'd me, in Time I may become a Duellist, I shall Cherish your instructionsâ Exit. Mer. Vengeance a your gratitude! Death, must I Flesh you all, till I am made a Taylers Bottom, to be stuck thus with your Needles. Ha! By this oilet-hole, they fight too, are valiant! Hold! Our quarrel's ended, y'are both well. Liza. Well! Yes, I am not sick, there's no pain In fighting. Mer. Let me kiss you Rogues. Ariot. What Rascals were we to be Cowards, I Do feel my self valiant now. Is all Agreed; where's your enemy? Mer. Oh! we parted friends, and he has left Me a remembrance about my wrist to Wear for's sake, he has stab'd a sinew. D'ye not see me left-handed, I have Made you both Soldiers, teach your hams Humility, and thank me for't. Ari. Now I think on't Ancient, you wear A Felt of mine, 'tis too conspicuous, It cost me coyn in Florence, Moneys too Must be restor'd. Mer. How? Ari. I do not know whether my valor be Quotidian, the fit is now upon me. Liza. Do Ariotto, it is well thought on, Some trifles too of mine, Meruole, y'are In my debt for. But put 'em in thy Schedule, I have accounts with another Gentleman, I'll presently search for him. Exit. Mer. Why thou Dogbolt, shall I recant and swear My opinion back again. Dost not see My right hand useless. Ari. Would 'twere otherwise, I thirst to exercise my new valor Upon some body. Mer. W'you shall have my place of fleshing Gentlemen, you see there's something to be Got by't. Exeunt. Enter Castracagnio, Florello, Piracco, Soldiers. Castr. Thou hast been cruel to thy self Florello, thy revolt Hath cancel'd all, hadst thou piled up desert To Heaven, this crime o'erthrows it. Flor. Seem not to make it Your sorrow, noble General, that I Am come to die; I have committed Sin to the earth I tread, whose dust wou'd Conspire and hang upon my guilty foot To apprehend me; my own colours blush I have forsaken them: And where before I drew my courage from that red, whose sight Paid back my loss of Blood, and through my eyes Supplied my veins, they now wave death and paleness To welcome my return. Castr. Why didst not wander In any part of the wild Earth, no ground But this, would have disturbed thee. Flor. And to this, Which I've offended, I'm come to make My justification, and to ware those titles I've all this while usurped. Opinion Hath been too partial in my undertakings And betray'd honors to me; can you think My actions were directed but by Chance, or that success did more then mock you To steal belief that I was valiant. Take back your thoughts. Pira. Was ever Faith so cozen'd, I held him a brave fellow. Flor. How Piracco, You held him a brave fellow! Am I grown So cheap in my humility, you should dare To censure me? Hath two or three attempts, (Children of Madness rather, and Dispair, Then discreet Valor, and bold Manhood) rais'd you To such an impudence, you dare conclude Me, or my worth, that thou were worthy to Grapple for Fame, upon a whirlwind with me, Shouldst seeâBut I am faln below my self To talk to such a Land-Rat. Castr. Piracco you forget your self; resume your temper. Pira. I took him at his word. Flor. I am cold again, your pardons Sir, and Heavens. It does not become a dying man to boast His Fame; Piracco, I forgive thee, had I look'd upon my present guilt, though I am my own accuser, I had suffered Thy affront with smoothness, I am no more the man I was. I was a Soldier, but the stock of shame And calumny; traytor to honor, and My Countrey; deny me now not that justice You give to every poor and base offender. I emplore death, and in the sight of Pisa, To whom, in friendship, I appeared hateful; Divorce my Rebel-Soul, least my own hands Grow mutinous, and take your justice from you. Castr. What Motive was so strong to ravish you From us to Pisa. Flor. You are come to that Will convert your wonder, and me To paleness, when I name the cause of my Revolt. Pira. I ever thought so. Flor. You thought, bold interrupter, Passion abuses me, take that which in Delivery must wound me; Love was the Witch that drew me from my arms. Castr. Love! What Creature? Flor. I'll tell you that, so you'll command the Soldiers To be in readiness to kill me. Castr. On. Flor. Her Hairs were Cupids Nets, a Forehead like The fairest Front of Heaven, without a Cloud; Her Eye-browe was Loves Bow, while either Eye Were Arrows drawn to wound; her Tongue was Loves Lightning, Neck the Milky-path or Throne Where sat the Graces. Castr. You describe her well. Flor. Yet all this beauty Hang on her but like Pendants on a Grave, To make the Monument glorious; for her Heart Was cold and buried in her, she was dead To Gratitude, so far from rewarding My bold enterprise, she punish'd it With scorn; and as I had been a person Carried infection, she made me be Excluded and sent back to bear the stain Of my dishonor home, to awake your Severity for my rash sin of loving Woman, unworthy Woman! Castr. Do ye love her still. Flor. I feel that flame quenching every minute. I can die without desiring life to Enjoy that Marble piece; I am as weary Of her, as of myself, having undone My fame, past all example; and the strength Of your Commission gives me glad assurance I am short lived. Castr. O noble Florello! I could weep for thee, were it manly; how Strangely love invades without distinction Of equality. Thus the bold Grecian At the Siege of Troy, grew weary of his Arms For fair Brises: Thus Cleopatra Did captivate the great Roman Soul, till Too much of her memory made him lose His own. But rise Florello from thy dull Sleep, be disinchanted, and resume thy Valors flame; I'm proud thy fate made thee offend, Th'art pardoned, exercise thy free command, As Honor should direct. Flor. Oh you are Injust, and do commit offence in mercy, As great as my revolt, by all our Lawsâ By that service in the Grisons War, when Providence directed me to come to Your rescue; when your Valor had Engaged you upon multitudes. Let me Beg, not to out-live this infamy. Castr. This Plea seems Most unnatural, desist, let me Expect to see you in my Tent. Exit. Flor. Not die? Piracco shall I be so miserable To live; have you no Friendship to intreat. Pira. I did urge him privately while You were discoursing, but he would not grant it. Flor. I resolve not to Be neglected so; if he deny Me one, there is a thousand ways to dieâ Exit. Pira. I, do so. Why now I'm of another humor, I never found my self more apt to cherish Life: Hang this noise of immortality, I ha'not the same Appetite I had To trade with danger, my Conscience would Need dispensation to take My leave of Gun-powder, and Pelmel, hum! I cannot conjure up this Devil Valor, That us'd to roar so in me. Enter Meruole, Ariotto. Ari. Nay nay, faith Ancient. Mer. Not a skirt! Ari. Some restitution were fairâ Mer. No, not the Wing of a Cossack. Pira. 'Tis my Surgeon Meruole, Humâ Ari. Return my Duckets then. Mer. Not a clipt Doit; good temptation leave, And 'twere the Dukes treasure, 'tis all damn'd: Talk of restoring in a Camp, O Heresie! Ari. How? Mer. Yes, and condemn'd by a Council of War. They Have Cannons, you believe are dangerous To those that break 'em. Pira. What if I mix with 'em, and maintain The opinion they hold of me. Ari. Must I lose all? Mer. No, you shall lose nothing but the Principal, I'll give you honest Use. Ari. What's that? Mer. Why? for instance, this Dutch Felt was yours, I'll use it for you gratis; for your Duckets, They are used so much already, they are quite Worn out. Pira. I'm resolved. Mer. Why, you Malt-worm, shall I ha'nothing for Fleshing of you: Who, the Pox, made you fight! And I had known it, you should ha' still continued My dear Revenue, and been Coward till Y'ad stunk us from the Trenches. Ari. 'Tis truth. Mer. Bring Law terms into the Camp, And talk of honesty and restitution, I'll first be sufled in my Colours. Ari. Well, th'art noble, I give thee A general release. Pira. Ancient, how is't? I thank thy Surgery, I am No Cripple now, Ariotto; When didst see my Subject. Enter Lizaro. Liza. Oh! Have I found you. Pira. How now Weezel, whether art thou creeping? Here's no Hens Nest. Liza. I have a note for you Captain. Pira. 'Death, a Challenge? Liza. A small note for you, I expect an answer; Ancient, you shall be witness. Mer. Who signs, is't a Bond? We'll share then. Ari. What didst deliver to Piracco? Pira. Imprimis, A Beaver, ha! Item, Two Laced Ruffs, a Pair of Boots; the Inventory of the things I took from him: A Belt, one Holland Shirt plain, another with Seaming-Lace âWhat's this? Liza. Commodities that were lent you; you shall Find ready money at the ballance of the Bill; Captain, these odd reckonings Between you and I, must be cleared. Mer. Observe 'em. Pira. Put in that Hat and Feather, and sum't up, I'll discharge all together. Liza. So you'll put me in other security. Pira. Ha! Will he fight? Come I was not serious, Take your Bonnet and be covered. Mer. How now Gentleman, what's the difference? Pira. He brings his Bill, and requires back his Loan And Subsidies for Beating. Shall I mince thee With thy own Sword; And like an Anthropomphagus devour thee, Thou Rabbet Sucker. Mer. I, do Piracco, scourge him As Boys do Tops; or make him dance The Irish Hey, over a Field of Thistles Naked. Why dost not draw? Pira. Meruole, dost not know me? Shall I destroy The wild thing? Prethee make him sensible What 'tis to enrage me. Mer. That I will. Ari. Faith, restore Captain. Mer. Do you mean to be balladed when you come To Florence. Why d'ye extend your arm forth Like a Fencers sign? Fight or expect no Weapon hereafter, but a Dog-whip to Be advanced against you. Liza. Will not your Captainship shew your Steel, because you once Did make a noise, and brave it? Do not tempt My patience, give me back my Moneys, And put me in good Sureties for my Wardrobe, Or by this Flesh I'll pink you. Pira. He is converted, why dost here Squirel, What Composition. Ari., Mer. Compound! Pira. 'Faith Ancient, I ha' done him wrong, and Because I see he's noble, I'll return Some of the trifles. Liza. Observe me I will have all, and more Then all; I will not now be satisfied, Unless you sight. Pira. Why then, be accessary to thy death. Mer. So, so, too't Bullies. Pira. I scorn to fight with such a Coward. Liza. Coward! Thou liest. Come back, you shall not part so. Pira. That wont provoke me. Mer. Can there be greater provocation In Nature? He's possest with a tame Devil. Pira. Hold, I cannot fight. Liza. I'll try that. Pira. There's my Sword, I am disarmed. Both. Ha! Give up's Weapon! Liza. This is somewhat. Mer. Captain Cow! Let's carry him to Bagola, And ha'him drest against Dinner. Ari. This is a miracle! Mer. Are you the Doughty Captain that did talk Nothing but Batteries, Famine, Death, And all the sad Remonstrances of War? Let us search him, and his Soul be not crept Into one of's Pockets. Liza. I am not satisfi'd, Since thou wou'd not fight, I'll know the cause Makes thee degenerate. Nimbly deliverâ Pira. Gentlemen, (for it cannot be conceal'd) Meruole made me a Coward. Mer. I! Thou fought'st with me. Pira. The Imposthume which your Sword hapned to launch, Let out my valor; truth is, the pain of that made Me desperate, not valiant. Since I feel my self to have a sound Body, I am loth to endanger it. Mer. Did this advance your from a Corporal, To be a Captain? I perceive some men Thrive by Diseases, then besides Physitians. Was I the Surgeon to do this feat too? Pira. I beseech you Gentlemen. Ari. I hav't! You shall now be my Subject. Liza. Yours! That were precious! No, hands off, he's mine For my discovery. Mer. Release your titles Gentlemen, My Surgery is unpaid for, give him gently To my possession, or try the agility Of your left arms: 'Tis not for your honors To deal upon unequal terms, and my Right hand is useless now. Ari. Fight with left hands. Mer. Or he that hath Arithmetick enough, Divide him into three equal portions. Pira. I am content, Kind Gentlemen. Liza. Oh thou Mungrel! Ari. I have a way to reconcile all; lets Draw Lots whose Subject he shall be. Mer. A match, and let him make 'em, so he may Preserve his flesh nimbly then. Liza. Well thought on. Mer. Is there no motion in you. Pira. YesâAncient, I wish I may fall to Your power, you'll use me nobly. Ari. When? Pira. I am preparing here Gentlemen! Mer. The longest cut enjoy him. Pira. Who must be my Soveraign? Ari. He's Meruoles. Mer. You yield he's mine. Liza. 'Tis your fate Sir. Mer. First let me see, Gentlemen, I must request your absence For a few minutes; I have a stratagem Would have a little privacy, or I shall Desire to see you at my Hut; nay, I Beseech you Gentlemen. Both. Farewel then, We'll expect you. Ari. Farewel. Mer. There is a ceremony to be us'd Captain, You must give me formal possession, By delivery of your clean Shirt: D'ye Observe me, mine is somewhat foul, quickly. Pira. Oh noble Ancient, Ah. Mer. Make a shift, come. Pira. By this light Ancient, I see company, Leave me not naked to the world. Mer. Retire then behind the next Tree, under Pretence to ease Nature, you may doff it. Mend your pace Tortoise. Pira. Oh Tyranny! Exeunt. Enter Florello his Sword drawn. Flor. To live is but to walk to death, why then Should we not take the nearest way, since that We make the period of our Pilgrimage? But we are wanton, and affect the path That keeps us circles in mortality, When the least declination, would teach us To die, and know, our errors. Enter Soranzo. Sor. My noble Lord. Flor. Welcome Soranzo, there is pitty now In Heaven, I give my self up hopeless To have a friend in my necessities, To do me the kind office. I'm a prisoner. Sor. A prisoner! Flor. A prisoner to the World, and thou shalt set me free. Sor. You are full of mystery, I understand you not. Flor. This will instruct thee, aim it at my bosom, And I will praise thee, when I'm dead. Sor. D'ye court me To be a murtherer. How long has life Been such a burden to you. Flor. Wot thou not, Cure my wound then. Sor. You would have me make one. Flor. There is else no physick for me, Prethee be charitable and do't Soranzo; 'Tis but extending of thy arm, and touch me, And I shall drop down like an Autemn leaf, Without a murmur. Sor. Why are you so cruel, name a cause That can require me to commit so great Injustice Flor. I will tell thee, if't be possible, I may believe thy ignorance. Oh Soranzo! That action which thy friendship made thee yield to Murder'd my fame. Now it is no secret To tell thee, Love, like a wild Passion Transported me to Pisa. Sor. Ha, love to Pisa! Flor. Why dost start, Iknow I am thy wonder. Here I was but a walking shadow, for My heart was lock'd up there with Bertolina, Foscari's Daughter. Sor. Bertolina! Flor. Thou hast a troubled countenance; has that name Power to recal thy blood, dost know her? Sor. Yes. Flor. How old is thy acquaintance, or what cause Brought thee unto the knowledgeâThou dost not Love her. Sor. I ne'er was guilty of a sin to hate So fair a Lady. Flor. There's danger in thy words, 'twill not be safe To converse further with me, yet I'll tell thee, Had the great Duke of Tuscanny receiv'd Encouragement to love her, and had made His crown and wealth the subtle Orators To plead for him; the venture that I made Would buy her from his arms, and force her through The wealth and treasures, like neglected things Behind her noble thoughts; his name not deserving To be remembred that day that Florello's Was in her memory, had her heart in Dower The Universal Graces of her sex, Ages to come would call my act too great A price for't, and the purchase dearly bought: Yet she refus'd. Sor. Her heart, my Lord, may be, Was not her own to give. Flor. What dost thou say Soranzo? Sor. Pardon, my Lord, The freedom of my language, or but hear it, Though you grow furious, and destroy me after. 'Tis my unhappiness to affect that Lady The trouble of whose fate, invited me To mingle with your Troups, when Pisa held Friendship with Florence. Flor. No more, I have a rival then! How dare Thy fortune be so saucy, get thee from My sight, a minute will endanger thee. My afflictions come tumbling like waves Upon me, there's another lost, my friend; Yet still I live, and must, unless I teach My hand to murder. Ha! blessed remembrance! The Battery, 'tis not in the power of death To avoid me, 'twill be some revenge to die The example of a Ladies cruelty. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Piracco, Ariotto, Lizari. Ariotto. How does the Ancient? Pira. My Tyrant is in health Sir. Liza. What, you have exchanged Wardrobes already. Pira. We have both one Tailor, And Landress, I thank him he puts forth my Linnen for me; but for shame I could Shew you the naked truth; was ever Captain so prey'd upon. Ari. Captain, Ha' not the Rats gnawn off that title yet. Pira. The Ancient does purpose to devour me first, And then he'll leave that for the Vermine. Liza. Th'art justly punished for thy tyrannising o'er us. Ari. This 'tis to be a coward. Pira. Alass, 'tis none of my fault. Liza. How! Not thy fault. Ari. Whose then? Pira. 'Tis an error in nature, I cannot Help it, I could wish it otherwise; I have disputed with my heart about it, But have no satisfaction, I've endeavored Always, that men prescribe to make it valiant. I ha'been drunk three times, a purpose, since My last kick, wherein I have attempted To make a noise, and roar, but hardly can Conjure up my spirit, able to put A Mouse in to a fear, that nibbles A'th Knapsack for the Cheese in't, or a Weezel That lies Perdue for a Hens Nest. I ha' not So much Blood left in me to blush. Ari. It seems so Lizaro, such things were we once. Pira. Pray Gentlemen speak to the Ancient To use me with more gentleness, and I had been So happy to ha'been a Subject To either of you, my life would not have Been so burthensome. Ari. And thou beest weary of thy life, why do you not Turn desperate as before, and fight? Liza. H'as no Imposthume now. Ari. Let him feed on Polecats, And get one; there be things that die in Ditches, And other nasty food to breed diseases. I see the generation of his valor Must rise out of corruption. Liza. Does he use you then with such severity, no mitigation! Pira. I have a priviledge, He's here Gentlemen. Enter Meruole drinking Tobacco, Bagola. Bag. Here they are: Ha'! Piracco by his Physnomy, But ancient Meruole by the garb. I observ'd not this before; what, disguised Captain? Liza. What health Meruole? Pira. Bagola we are all one, Do they not fit, we change habits often. But that he has The greater bush hangs at his Tavern face, We might easily be mistaken, Thou Lady o'th' Lake: A Pox a whispering. Meruole, shall I play the Farrier, and Drench you for the sullens. Liza. This is pretty. Mer. I do allow him this, or rather he Allows himself; for he pays for't heartily, That's his comfort. Pira. Go bring a Barrel hither; why? when you Scolopendra Gentlemen now plead for me, I beseech you' noble Exit Bagola. Ancient, you see how ready I am to Observe you, you might be pleased to take Compassion on my Fortune. I confess I ha' deserved infamy, but my Stars Are to be accused as well as I. Mer. Does he not speak like one that's taking leave A top o'th' Ladder, and bequeathing precepts To the young fry, that come to see him swing. To avoid pilfering, and playing at Dice With Costermongers for Oranges, And such like ungracious counsel. Ari. Ancient, do him some favor for our sakes. See how he looks. Mer. I ha' seen a Dog Look like him that has drawn a Wicker Bottle Ratling about the street, and leering On both sides, where to get a corner, To bite his tail off. Enter Bagola. Bag. Captain here. Pira. Art thou come Proserpine, here my Bullies, A health to Agamemnon. Liza. The Captain's sprightly, and talks big again. Pira. 'Death, I'll not spare you Ancient, what a Flincher, Quaff it off Mulciber, or I'll force it down Your Channel, how now! Thou King of Sparrows, But wet your Bill so; what Ariotto, In contemplation, begin, begin, I'll pledge thee Mushrom! Ari. I have not sign'd you any such Commission. Pira. Th'art a Trojan, I hug thee Lizaro, drink. Liza. Let it go round. Exit Bagola. Pira. Courteous Ancient release me, name My ransome, deliver me from these Agues; These violent fits, which I am forced to For honors sake, may much endanger me. Mer. Why have you not a noble priviledge To bark thus to my face; the great Turk with All his Janisaries would not be Permitted to make this noise; besides, you know I have but half your pay yet, that's a business To be consid'red on; for I do find, I cannot without loss afford you so Much impudence for the price, therefore observe me. I here before these Gentlemen depute, And fully authorise you to receive for me, Your entire pay, with all and singular, The emoluments that shall accrew unto The Captainship, and to oblige your truth And honesty in Accounts, during pleasure, You shall receive the just tithe of your pension, Together with acquittanceâ Pira. How shall I live? Mer. On Sallades, Catter-pillers, and wholsome Roots, To suffice nature; quench your thirst with Pippins Instead of mighty Wine, surfeit with Cloves Of Garlick, or eat Hors-bread, and so grow hearty. Pira. Is this all? Mer. 'Tis more then I'll be at the charge of to, Now I think on't, you shall cashier your company. Pira. How? Mer. Pretend thou hast a Father lies a dying, Worth thousands, though he served a Prentiship To a Botcher, and with broken ends of Fellony, Never could patch up Ten pounds together. I'll procure thy freedom, th'ast a tunable voice To beg, and tell Camp lies in, 'Tmay raise you to a fortune; or if you carry Home the full number of your Limbs, you may Creep into some Kitchin service, and in time Be Dog controuler. Within. Arm, arm! 'Death, the words given, heigh a Battery! Ari., Liza. A Battery! Exeunt. Enter Governor, Colonel, Soldiers. Col. They have already dismounted our Cannon. Gover. Make another Sally. Col. They fight like Men were greedy of destruction, They weary our Artillery. Enter Soldier. Sold. The Out-works are all spoil'd, the Sconce taken, And they come on like Furies. Gover. Have you care to prevent the danger Of the Petards, the Devil is not able To resist those Engines, if they once fasten Upon the Gates; courage, to the Walls, and Die with honor. Exeunt. Enter Castracagnio, Ariotto, Lizaro, &amp;c. Castr. Florello hath done wonders, if he survive the danger of The breach. On Gentlemen Pursue your victory. Exeunt. Enter Soranzo. Sor. Pisa is bleeding! Florello has done things above a Man, He flies about like flame, and consumes all His anger meets with; nor is Bertolina Safe now. Angels guard her from his fury, I languish till I see her. Exit. Enter Meruole beating Piracco, Colours. Mer. March on, you Bear-whelp. Pira. Good Ancient, is not the Town taken already. Mer. I'll ha' thee cram'd into a Cannon, and Shot back again to Florence. Pira. If I be slain, you'll lose a Subject of me. Mer. You shall stand by, and catch the Bullets then: On, on. Exeunt. Enter Bertolina, Ranola. Ran. O Madam, if I be kill'd with one of The Pellets, I'll take my death on't, 'tis your Fault, and you had staid Florello, you had Been secure from Guns. Bert. I am unhappy, And onely fit for death, Heaven protect My Father, though his anger punished me With restraint, I'll pray for him. Florello, Bring home thy justice to my heart, and save The innocent. Enter Soranzo, and Keeper. Sor. Not admitted, there's reward For your officiousness. Ran. He has knock'd down our Keeper. Bert. Soranzo! Sor. I know not Madam, with what words to call Your fears up, nor to give expression To my sad embassie; you may tell your self If you but read my countenance, wherein Is character'd a sorrow for your fate. Florello hath taken Pisa. Bert. Proceed Sor. The duty that I ow to your command, Imboldens grief, and gives alacrity, Even to horror. I am come Lady, A sad Harbinger to take a Lodging up For Death, that now is borrowing Wings of Time To hasten hither Florello, you have Made too late your cruel enemy, who If ever fear did prophesie, is yet But in the way to his revenge. He led Up forces to this Battery. Bert. Pray omit Circumstance, be particular with what I am to expect. Sor. 'Tis concluded in a syllable, Death. Bert. And so is Life. You might have been less tedious Soranzo, I Never held my self immortal. Sor. When Do you grow pale, and curse the Messenger That frighted you. Bert. Heaven avert so great Impiety! This Relation doth Not deserve such ingratitude. Sor. That vertue should like the Phenix, Kindle fires with her own Wings, And fan her ashes to a second life; But when thy breath, sweeter then Spices That wait on the others Funeral, shall return To Heaven, the World must be an eternal loser. O Bertolina, do not account me So unhappy, that I came onely to Prepare thy Obsequies, my ambition Is not to outlive that fatal minute. I have no other use of life, and you Cannot deny him Grace in Death, whom you have Coldly honored for his living service; And if my love may hope for so much glory, That you will but name Soranzo, with one Kind accent at your death. We are interruptedâ Enter Florello, with a Case of Pistols. Flor. The zeal I had to be a Sacrifice, Hath been the loss of Pisa, and I walk As I were proof against all the Engines Of War and Death. Hah! Into what place of Horror, hath my wildness brought me? Art Not thou Soranzo? That Bertolina? Bert. We are. Flor. To what affliction will fate reserve me Next? Did Death distrust his power to kill, And left me for this object? More prodigious Then the fam'd Gorgon. Here be the Adders that convert to Marble, The inconsiderate gazer. Bert. Florello! Flor. And had Soranzo ta'en possession Of her Soul! Excluded all my merit? Thou hast deceived him, Bertolina is Now Lord of both your destinies, pray quickly, I must dispatch a pair of Messengers To inform your hearts that I'm injured, And you shall both die. Bert. 'Tis not to live I beg, I'm not covetous of breath, When Florello thinks the air too Great a benefit for Bertolina. I know there will be time, when Nature will Be sick and die; and all that we affect, Must be resigned, forgotten when the dust Carries no figure of our pride. I am Desirous now to meet your wrath, and mix With Pisa's friends. I would not survive them To have a new solemnity, and mourn My Virgin-Widowhood; but as you would Leave your fame precious to posterity, Let not your fury be unjust, but save This young man. Sor. Why are you cruel to imploy your breath To make me wretched by your white Soul, Then which, the World knows no purer Altar? Life shall not hinder me the Triumph to Wait on you. Florello shall not strike More daringly, then I can meet his Thunder. Yet if he be not lost to Piety, He'll spare this Temple; which to violate, Were not to leave a sin hereafter to Be call'd a Sacriledge. Flor. Their Souls are knit, what will become of me. Now to divorce them, were rude impiety. Here take you that, assure your Gives them Pistols. Safety, and destroy me first, for I find I shall have no mercy on you. Faint Not, least I resume my Vengeance, and Seal your eternal absence. Will you not Remove my dwelling, and secure your loves. Be wise and active, Do you hold Death too great a favor? I'll live then till I can find out a punishment Above life; and to encrease my affliction, Gives her to Soranzo. Live, and be anothers, I resign all my Claim, take her, thou hast possest her heart Before me, I give thee but her hand. Live, and each day renew the marriage Of a chast Love, time Soranzo which Shall onely serve to wither me, make thee Happy in her. I forgive you! and Bow to my own fate, it hath o'ercome me; But do not make a mockery of my tameness. Sor. O nobleness, which can never be admir'd Enough in our dull age! Posterity Shall call this act their wonder! O Lady, We enter now upon our lives, I am Nothing but joy, my Bertolina! Flor. So I'll now go seek out some forsaken Earth, And there grow old in Prayers, that I may Forget you both, and my own name. Farewel. Bert. Carry not, Sir, the burthen of a sin Beyond that you suppose we have committed, To afflict you in your solitude, y'are guilty Of a robbery, ere you part Make noble restitution. Flor. To whom, Ha! Bert. It is injustice to dispose of wealth That others have a right to, but without The owners consent, is tyranny. You have made Gift of my heart to Soranzo, whom Though I honor, yet I have not plac'd So near it, that it should incorporate With his: And is not this a theft upon My liberty. Sor. How's this? Flor. Hah! Bert. And yet not mine, pardon me Florello, I have it but in trust; nor have ye power, Were I dying, to bequeath it as a Legacy to any, would you take The trouble which you late pretended to Search, I believe you'ld find written there The name that owed it. Flor. Why d'ye perplex me? Bert. Ye are incredulous. By all the lives of Virgins that have left their Memories, Religious for their Chastity, The Needle Is not more constant to the North, then my Heart full of obedience unto you; Nor can it know a change, It having despaired long since, ever to find One like Florello to cherish it. Sor. My happiness has been a dream. Flor. Play not the Syren. Bert. Fear urgeth no confession, could I be Other, you have dis-engaged my vows. You were not charitable, to construe My desires to preserve your fame unstained (Which made you first precious to me) a Revolt in my affection: 'twas a jealousie I could not miss, and love you. Flor. Am I not turn'd to a Statue? Bert. Soranzo, as th'art a Gentleman, I challenge thee To accuse me, if in thy encouragement To love, I have infringed my vows to him, Was ever a faint syllable let fall To make you hope for it. Sor. I have made too greedy, application, And find my error. Flo. By degrees I'll come To the belief on't; let me touch thy hand, It is my own again, this kiss I seal'd At parting, she has preserv'd the impression For me. I do feel the very breath I lent it, return back, as if she suspected I should miscarry in the War, and kept it Warm, to do a miracle Upon me, and renew life. Shall I call thee My Bertolina? Bert. Not to be yours, now You have recovered fame were to be lost For ever, be you so just, to Acknowledge me; or if your despiseâ Flor. Not for the wealth of Florence, were it made The Worlds Exchequer, Divine Harmony Dwells on thy words I am now created. Soranzo, why dost look upon my bliss With such a melancholly brow? Thou hast Lost nothing; if thou enviest me, let us Dissect each other instantly, that she May see whose heart doth best deserve her. Bert. Goodness forbid! Sor. I am o'ercome with both your Nobleness, And I should make my memory scorned, to Wish misfortune to your loves. You have Power o'er my life, as her vertues have o'er My passion. With a free-soul I wish All joy crown your Union, I am content To wear the Willow now. Enter Castracagnio, Governor, Meruole, Ariotto, Lizara, Piracco. Castr. The remnant of the common faction We have power to banish, be't proclaim'd, that The Town must now admit our Garisons. You, my Lord, must to Florence. Gover. Use your power. Castr. You shall find it honorable. Bert. My Father! Castr. Florello, to thy valor our triumph is indebted. Gover. The City mourns, thy folly hath defaced Her goodly Structures, and turn'd her Monuments Into a rude pile. We are all lost! Flor. You have found a son, though not to recompence The publick sorrow; yet to make it seem Less or more sufferable, we are your children. Gover. Ha! Castr. My Lord, a happy Omen to close up Our Wars! Will a Sun-shine take away the storm. Flor. It doth a little alter the complexion, And makes it appear smiling. Gover. Rise and be happier then I. Ah Girl, This should have been done earlier. Castr. I do congratulate you both, and Wish plenty of joys dwell on you. Mer. Please your excellenceâ Flor. Your are too silent Sir, and apprehend To deeply what has past, look on the present State of things, and then you shall have cause to Conform to the Dukes will. Gover. You shall o'ercome. Castr. Is't possible? Mer. These Gentlemen, who to their honor be't mentioned, Were his cowards, and paid him tribute, till they found The commodity of fighting for their liberties Shall witness his apostacy, if he dare but Spit in defiance of this truth. Pira. 'Tis a miserable truth, but I am punished for't already. Castr. As the opinion of his courage Prefer'd him from a Corporal, his known cowardise Degrades him from all offices in War. Take thou his Company. Pira. I beseechâ Castr. Come, noble Pair, your marriage Shall be presently solemnized. Foscari Assure your self, I'll labor to procure Your pardon of the mighty Duke of Florence. Now Pisa put off thy mourning, And gather up thy drops of Blood again, That all may dance to th'Musick of this Peace, Let Bridal tunes sound high, now the Drums cease. Exeunt omnes.</field>
