      <field name="fulltext">To the truly Noble, Sir IOHN SIDLEY Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO My dear Friend Mr John Tatham, On his Excellent Play, The Distracted State. I do not write in confidence my fame May lift you up, or hoist you to a Name: I of my own defects too knowing am To hope support you, While my self am lame; And th' world so well your Merits understand, They do not need advancement by my hand. Nor do I labour to be thought a Wit Because in you I do approve of it. What makes you shine, does make me not dispair To hope a glimmering in the self same air: To Love I'm vow'd too; not that wayward toy That for these thousand yeers writes himself Boy; Who makes the Lord and Lady still to meet, As sure as in a Country Dance wee see't. 'Tis motley, just like Cheeses where I've been, Checkquer'd, one square of white, and one of green; 'Tis at the best imperfect, such a pair Like Doublets in the middle joyned are; While masculine affections, such as mine, Like Diamonds, entire and cleerly shine. To Womankind a while I bid adue, And only now enamour'd am of you. And certain, 'tis no miracle in me, T' whom Civill War hath been a nursery, That I in strict obedience to my fate, Do fall in Love with your Distracted State I. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my worthy Friend Mr. Iohn Tatham, on his Excellent Tragedy, The Distracted State. Good Wine does need no bush, nor does thy wit Want our supporting, this thy Play is writ With so much judgement, and so firm a hand, It shall against the stormes of Envy stand A Monument to thy fame: for if we may Conclude Language and Plot do make a Play, Here they are met, each Scene and Act so well Follow'd, that one the other doth excell; And their contention does so neatly end, As though thou didst a second Rape intend Vpon our sense, drawing our greedy eyes To read, till they themselves do Sacrifice. For he that loves to Feast on a good line, Will never think he has enough of thine. R. D.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my most Deserving Friend I. T. Vpon his Play, The Distracted State. VVhen I that sweet Elixar of thy lines Tasted, and found within those golden Mines That rare refin'd delight, in which 'tis sin Not to be lost or catch'd in fancies gin, I did thy worth so cleer a Victor see The Lawrell could be due to none but thee. I cannot offer Hecatombs of praise, Nor Altars to thy lofty fancy raise; This well meant Tribute I can only pay; Wit's high Meridian glorifies thy Play. G. Lynn.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actus 1. Scena 1. Loud Musick. Enter Mazares, the Archbishop of Monreall, Cleander, Agathocles, Epecides, Philistus, Adulanter, &amp;c. Mazares ascends the Chaire of State, the Archbishop puts the Crown on's head; then, all, but Agathocles, cry Long live Mazares lawfully King of Sicily. AGATHOCLES. Heaven where's thy Vengeance? Canst thou endure this Mockery? Agathocles kneeles with his back towards them, aside. Maza. We thank you all. But why Agathocles Appears such trouble on thy brows, are we Unwelcome to thy wishes? Agath. How Sir! Pardon me. Who dares say you are? You are my King,âIs it not so Gentlemen? The Raies that from your Brothers Diadem Gilded this Kingdom are put out, and now From you our rising Sun, we must expect A Vertuall fervor. Obedience is my safety. My wishes! triflles, what may you not Command? If you but will, my life is not my own. One frown may Rivet me, I am design'd To be but what you please, and when, no longer. I am your poor Submissive. Maza. You Misconstre The power of Kings, they dare not but be just. That Crown can ne'r sit fast that takes it's rise From others ruine. Agath. Out Impostureâ [aside. Maza. My Lords I could have wish'd The Peoples and your Loves had spar'd this solemnity Until another time, a time that might Have prov'd more fit for Triumph; for though Heaven Hath wreath'd our Brows with Victory, our thoughts Are not at peace. Agath. Nor ever will be til [aside. By their continuall motion they have brought All into Publike ruine. Maza. The Care of th'Common safety O'rwhelms our Joy and makes it seem unseasonable. Repose after so long a toile of War would bee Perfume unto our Senses, but we must not Prefer our own before the Peoples quiet. Agath. Machivell thou art an Asse, a very Asse to him [aside Maza. My Lords, you are my witnesses, The Publike wrong, and not Ambitious hopes Of Government, Oblieg'd me to this Quarrell (The Peoples and not mine) against my Brother; The Justice of which cause gave us Success. Heaven knowes, had he not bin their Enemy, I should have emptied ev'ry vein I have T'have serv'd him. Nature and Duty held Strong Conflicts in my blood, Nature promoting One while my Brothers right, untill my Duty Unto my Country with Diviner Reason O'rcame me, and discover'd the sad Scene Of a sinking People, and a rising Tyrant. Agath. Does Heaven hear this, and punisheth not? [aside Maza. For my part, my Lords, Though the affection of the People Circles My Temples with a Crown, I shall not wear it Longer than they 'steem me worthy. Clean. Most singular Prince. Agath. Most singular Devill.â [aside Maza. My Lord Arch-Bishop, You are the Church's Vine, and we the Elm O, th' Common-wealth, our flourishing Estates Depend on one another; by Heaven's hand We are Contracted, and must share all fortunes, Or good, or bad. The Iewels of a Crown Retain not Lustre longer than they have Vertue from th'Church, and that she's glorious; Nor can she be so longer than we are so, Her strength and welfare doth consist in ours. Let not this suddain change Possesse her with a fear of her Ecclips. Sh'as a Protector now, that will expose His life a Sacrifice to preserve her Purity. We shall not be remisse to satisfie What lies on our part towards her, and what From her belongs to us we need not intimate, You have a Sense my Lord, can reach at things And their Necessities. Archb. My Duty shall not be wanting, my gracious Lord. Agath. The Church-man will turn Pander to him. [aside Maza. My Lords, W'are not insensible of the Peoples burthen By keeping up our Armies, but necessity That makes men Act what they would not, Compels it; We are not yet secur'd against the Malice Of our late vanquish'd Brother, there's a faction That waits an opportunity to befriend him, Beside his hopes in Italy; those clouds over, We doubt not but a fair day wil give birth Unto the Peoples happinesse and ours. In the mean time my Lords be it your Care To stop the current of their Cries, and keep Us fair in their opinion. Agath. As Hel's Projector. Down, down big heart, thoul't hang me else. [aside to Epecides. Epeci. My Lord, Let Reason moderate your Passions, They are two violent, and may prove your Enemies. [Epec. to Agat. aside Mazares wants not Hands. Agath. Nor I a Heart To dare his worst; oh Epecides [aside to Epe. I have liv'd too long to see this day. Maza. My Lords, we know Crowns are but glorious burthens, and the weight Requires more heads than one to bear it up. You are th' approved Pilots of the State, Acquainted with all Creekes, and Rockes where danger Hides his destroying-head, and wisely can Steer her, should th' Malice of a Forraign Foe Swell to a Tempest, or Malignant breaths At home threaten her Ruine; on your faiths Depends ours and her safety. Clean. Most gracious Sir, You have out-done even Expectation? and The Beams of Vertue that shoot from you Out-shine the Glory of your Diadem, And bind our lives unto your Fortunes. Phili. May we owne our lives no longer Than they perform those offices of Duty Your Vertues do Command them to. Maza. We owe much to your Loves, And shall engrosse a time to pay the Debt Your Merits call upon us; wee'l divide The happinesse, if any wait upon A Crown, amongst you. Agath. When hee's warm in's Seat, They shall as little dare to claime his Promise, [aside to Epeci. As the poor Crane his reward from the Lyon, When hee had pull'd the Bone out of his throat. Epeci. Restrain your self, Ther's little Revenge in words, but words may be Revenged, be advis'd. [aside to Agat. Adulan. May never Care breed feavors in your blood, Nor troubles raise a Palsie in your Scepter; May stil Successe attend your Enterprizes, And Conquests beget Conquests, till you write Your Self the Worlds great Monarch. Archbi. May Heaven's eye Keep Sentinel while you repose, that no Trayterous Attempts may reach your Sacred Person. Agath. Now may the Grones of dying men, the cries [Agath. kneeles, aside Of Widdows, Orphans, and defloured Virgins, Together with his Brother's wrongs continually Keep him awake, till with distracted rage (For want of Rest) he doth become his own Dire executioner. Maza. What meanes this? Agathocles? Agath. I have bin at my Prayers too. Maza. We thank you, and shall Endeavour to deserve so far, You shall not have Cause to repent them. Agath. I beleeve no lesse. Maza. Lead on my Lords, With upright Care we shall discharge our trust; Kings are no longer Kings, than they are just. Exeunt. [Agathocles pulls Epecides back. Agath. My Lord Epecides, a word, The King may spare us two; I may presume We are as little needed as regarded. If that thy looks deceive me not, thou art Yet free from this disease, this Itch of Honour, Which so transformes us into Servile flattery. Art swell'd with lofty thoughts? Epeci. They reach no higher Than th' Publike good, which they devoutly wish, Though want a power to Compasse. Agath. Th'art honesty it selfe; And to thy Bosome as my Sanctuary, My Soul shall fly to ease itself of what Would burst me to keep longer. Epec. My Lord, you may Be confident I have a Soul as big With Grief as you, that fain would be deliver'd, If Reason would turn Midwife. Agath. False Cleander Hath made the Field drunk with his Countrey's blood, To set up an Usurper. Epeci. It is pretended The Peoples Pressures and continuall Calmours Enforc'd the War. Agath. Kindl'd by the fire Broke from Mazares bosome, whose Ambitious Desire of Rule, bred the ill humors in The easily corrupted Multitude, Who, led by their pernicious hopes, that he Would bring on better daies, gave breath unto Their Monstrous fury, and like a deluge, Brake forth and sanke the Fortunes of Evander: That he poor Prince, having no other Arke Of Preservation than his Innocence, And faith he had in's friends, did fly to them Whose shelter serv'd him but for a short time, For they with him at last were overwhelm'd. But Epecides be thou confident, Though Hell hath further'd the Usurpers Plot, And smooth'd it with successe, Vengeance will reach him. Though heaven be slow it's punishment is sure. Epeci. Hear but Cleander, Philistus, Adulanter, and the rest, And they will tell you Providence and Justice Sate on their Weapons points to punish Tyranny; And that our Kingdom by Mazares wisdom, Will flourish in a far better Estate, Than in Evanders time. Agath. Ambition wants not snares To Catch Vulgar Credulity, and carry On their Designes cleere to the end they aime at. They are the Canes and Truncks through which th' Usurper Speaks to promote his purposes, and blast All good in's Brother, and Ecclips his right. Is not Planetius, the first bold Traytor, Of Mona made Provinciall? Is not Cleander As big with hopes and Expectation? Does not Philistus fawn, and Court to out Missellus the Provinciall of Vallis de Noto. Credit such Sycophants? Epeci. Missellus is Noble, And if Mazares look not well about him, Evander may have an after Game to Play, Missellus was his Creature. Agath. Where e'r he be, Though fortune left his Party, he retaines A Minde invincible. Epec. No question but The State was much distemper'd, and Evander Was not without his faults. Agath. People dispos'd for Change, Survey the Vices of their Prince through Opticks That rather multiply than lessen them: And what is in themselves but Criminall, Is in their Prince held horrid, as the Symptome To the disease of Tyranny. Epeci. And dare correct, That in their Prince they would not in themselves Have taken notice of. Agath. But allow there were Some things might grieve the People; Wise Experience Gives us to know that in th' lopping of Trees, The skilfull hand prunes but the lower Branches, And leaves the Top still growing to Extract Sap from the Root, as meaning to Reform, Not to Destroy. I tell thee Epecides, Th' Excesse of what was good in Prince Evander, Might Stock the barren breast of the Usurper. Epeci. Men never rate their goods so highly As when th'are rob'd of them. It is some ease To our afflictions, that we can thus vent Our Griefes to one another, for we must Despair of other remedy. Agath. Very true, If we continue Children, and adore The Rod corrects us, kisse it till we smart for't, Enthrone base Fear in Valours royal Seat, Let it Lord o'r our Spirits, till our blood Forsake its heat, and become Ice: But if We do retain the Glory of our Ancestors, (Whose Ashes will rise up against our dulnesse;) Shake off our Tamenesse, and give way to Courage, We need not doubt (inspir'd with a just rage) To break the necks of those that would yoke ours. Epeci. I butâ Agath. Those Buts destroy us; are you willing To sit in th' dark and never see the Sun; With a besotted Patience see your goods Rifled, and your Inheritance tane from you, Unlesse you to secure his quiet will Part with your own, and by compliance banish The peace your Conscience yet is happy in? Epeci. You know my Spirit's not so chill But I would know a way, prescribe you one That's passable, I shall not onely run My Fortunes with you, but make all the friends And neerest Allies I have as ready minded To do you service. Agath. To a Resolved Minde Nothing seemes difficultâArchias has a Noble gallant Spirit. Epeci. What then? Agath. Hee ever was a friend to Vertue, and's of Mazares line too. Epeci. Unfold the Mystery. Agath. What would you say ifâhe's wellbelov'd and active. [Enter a Messenger Epeci. Doe you suspect me? Agath. No, but hold here's some upon us. Messen. Which is the Lord Philistus or Cleander, either will serve. Agath. What is your businesse? Mess. I've Letters to the King. Agath. Whence came you? Mess. From Messina. Epeci. How fares the Lord Planetius? Messe. His Honor is in health, I'd faine be discharg'd. Agath. What news, what news, wee'l bring you to the King. Mess. Extreme good Gentlemen, the late Tyrant after his defeat going for Italy, was surpriz'd by some of Tyche, in the Province of Vallis de Noto, killd, and cast into the River; a death too good for him. Agath. So Sirâ Epeci. Oh forbearâBut hear me friend is this newes certain? Messe. My Lord Planetius the Provinciall of Mona had it so Sir, and he hath sent the same unto the King. I can say no more on't Sir, please you to bring me to those Gentlemen. Agath. Ther's enough in Court to shew you, you may walk thither Sirâ Messe. I could have done that without all this doe Sirâ Exit Messe. Epeci. Passion's too much your Enemy. Agath. Dog! a death too good for him? Epec. What think you now on th' businesse you were upon? Agath. I am beside my selfe, my Courage leaves me, And Reason tels me now I must be tame. The Kingâ Enter Mazares, Cleander, Philistus, Adulanter, &amp;. Messenger. Maza. Were not the Villaines found. Messen. I do not know and't please your Majesty. The King seemes to be troubl'd at this News. [aside. Ile change my Noteâ'tis like they were, For w' heard the Provinciall of Vallis de Noto had Appointed the death of some body. Maza. He did but Justice then; Oh Philistus And you my honoured Lords, our Griefes want utterance; He was our Brother, though our Countries Enemy, And they have tane away a part of us That sent him hence; It was a Deed (though Heavens Just hand was in't) we cannot but Lament. Your Pardon Supreme powers. Phil. Most pious Prince. Maza. Blame us not my Lords. We say again He was our Brother, and We cannot stop The Course of Nature. [seems to weep. Agath. Can this be reall! Messen. He was a Gracious Prince, ther's the truth on't. I could weep too for him. Adula. How you Villaine? Messe. Why the King is not offended with me I hope? alas I have Nature in me too, good, Vertuous Prince, Evander. Adul. Hast thou a mind to be hang'd? Messe. How! Is the Wind at that door. No Sir, not for e'r a dead Prince in Christendome; your Majesty may spare your teares, for in truth and verity he was but so, so. Maza. Friend didst not say That th' Actors were punish'd by Missellus. Messe. So I heard an't like your Highnesse. Maza. Tis strange Planetius writes not so, but it's very likely; Missellus has in many things been seen Ready and Active for him, and no doubt Would nowâ Cleand. Come, Come, Missellus growes too popular, Your Majesty may think on some more faithfull. Maza. We guesse your meaningâPhilistus, We shall dispatch you upon some affaires, As soon as we can shake this sadnes off, And our Mind's fit for businesse. Phil. It becomes my Duty to wait your Highnesse pleasure. Maza. Fellow attend our Secretary for a Confirmation of the Provinciallship of Mona to Planetius. Come my Lords. Exeunt. Enter Archias and Harmonia. Harm. Begon so soon my Lord? y'are hardly entred My Father house. Though th' entertainment comes Short of your Merits, My Lord, beleev't y'are welcome To poor Harmonia. Archi. Th'art rich in all that's good, And that's a Dower Queens would be glad to boast of. Since thy descent to love me, I'm exalted Above a Monarch's happinesse. Harmo. And part so soon? You have some other Mistris whose heaven Depends upon your Visit. Arch. Pretty Jealousie, How sweetly it becomes her; Beleeve me dearest, By the blest hopes I have in thee, Not any Beauty in Cicily (if there can any be Besides thy selfe; for in thee is the full Perfection of all Beauty met) has part Of the least thought of mine. Harm. You shall not go though yet. Enter Cleander. Arch. Thy Fatherâwilt thou now License me to go; I'le see thee e're the Sun be six hours older. [offers to go off. Cleand. My Lord Archias you have honour'd me Exceedingly by this your Visit. I hope my comming Does not remove you hence. Arch. My good Lord, Excuse me I beseech you, did not Businesse Of much Concernment call me hence, I should Account that time wel spent wherein I might Serve you and your fair Daughter. Clean. Pleasure your self my Lord. Arch. I am your Lordships Servantâadue Sweet. Exit. Cleand. Harmonia, I guesse this Young Lord loves thee, His often Visits promise some such business; But I'd not have you Countenance it. Harm. Why I beseech you Sir? You have bin pleas'd to lavish forth his prayses Beyond the Common Character; I've heard you say (With Pardon Sir) hee had much Vertue in him. Clean. And has so, but he cannot bring his Heart T'affect this King, although he be his Kinsman. Harm. That is no Crime worthy my Notice Sir, Much lesse my disrespect. Pray give me leave To use him but with that Civility Becomes the Education of your Daughter. Clean. My intents Fly higher to advance thee, if I live, And that the King perform his Royal word, (As that he dares not but doe) thou shalt stand In Competition with a Queene for Greatnesse. Mazares is too weak a Politician, To think my vast Soul can bee hemm'd within The Circle of a Province, when a Kingdome Will scarce contain it. No, I do but take This as a Spot of Earth to what I aim at. I mean to Match thee Girle unto some Prince, By whose Assistance I'l reach the Ascendent, The Royall Seat Harmonia, And then Wee are thy Princely Father: Dos't not Noise Rarely my Girle, the very Sound inspires My Soul with flames of MajestyâGo on Cleander, 'Till Neighbouring Princes wondring at thy Fate, With trembling Scepters dread their own Estate.

Maza. Bring us Wine, Wee are dispos'd to drown our Brothers Memory, And its appendent Sorrowes in a full Bowl of rich Wine. Phili. Done like your Princely self. Maza. What should we Contract our Youth to Cares for, waste the heat Beats in our agile veines, and draw upon Our head a Snowy-Perrywig before Age claims it? We are resolv'd to make Our blooming Yeers no Prey for Melancholy. Phili. You are our Sun, and we the Infant Plants That take life from you; when your Brow is Clowded We droop and Pine, as wanting heat; your Highnesse Now shews your self in Glory; and our heads That lately were prest down with discontent Look up to blesse the Change. Adul. Your Highnesse put Us all in fear you would Convert your Court Into a Monastery. Maza. Ha, ha, ha, into a Mouse-trap rather. Philistus to thee.âFellow let not any [drinks. Enter the Presence if thou regard'st thy safety. 'Tis hop'd our Subjects, will allow us a time Of Mirth after our toil for them. Phili. Whether they will or not, your Majesty has power to take it. Maza. How e'r we seem'd to take our Brothers death, 'Thas brought on our security, for such As durst before speak loud and big, now dare not Be seen to Whisper 'gainst us. Phili. Tis a point of Policy, High as your Highnes safety to keep them At such an Awfull distance; ther's Epecidesâ Maza. A Close and cunning Sophister, he carries A fire within him scarce to be discern'd. Phili. Agathocles comes not much short of him. Maza. He has a daring Soul, and does attract The lewd Licentious People, as the fire That draws ill Vapours to't, but w'are resolv'd He and the rest of's Insolent Crew shall meet Our Justice if they Submit not. Phili. Your Majestie's brow Is too serene, something of Wrath there seated Would seem far better. Maza. Wher's our Secretary. Adul. Call the Kings Secretary Enter Secretary. Maza. Hast done the Patent we gave Order for? Secret. 'Tis ready for your Majesties Signing. Maza. Give us Ink,âsoâPhilistus, We have Iust cause to doubt Missellus faith too, And therefore will remove him, and on thee Confer the honour. He is seated like A Thorn in th'Heart of Cicily, and must be Cut off lest he spread farther, and do gore us. [gives him the Patent. Take this as earnest of our Love to thee, Whose Loyalty we are assur'd of. Phil. Fame Shall spread your Royall Bounty through the World, And may leave to Be when I forget To be your Highnesse Servant. Maza. Cleander had Our promise for't, but We do know him one Of an unconstant Spirit, full of Spleen; A Mind high and unbounded, and to drive On his own ends, will enter into League With Turke or Devill; therefore tis not safe For us to lay a trust of so high consequence On such a frail foundation, One whose faith Complies with every Winde, and strikes his Sailes With every Tide and Change. But You drink slowly.âCome to thy Good Journey. [Cleander knocks. Guard. The King is private. Clean. I must speak with him. Maza. Who's that so loud there? Guard. The Lord Cleander. Maza. Tell him 'tis not our pleasure to be spoke with. Guard. My Lord you hear the King. [Cleander strives and rusheth in. Clean. My Businesse is of Concernment, I will enterâHow's this? surrounded With his Flatterers; tis like to be A State well govern'd. Maza. Sir, you are Uncivill. Clean. What mean you Royall Sir? Maza. Y'are sawcy, We say again y'are sawcy. Clean. How? Mazares. How durst you bee so insolent? Clean. I have deserv'd Sir better language from you. My anger is too strong for my Obedience, And will have th' upper hand. I come To claim your Royall wordâI am Cleander Sir, Whose hand did seat the Crown upon your head Sir. Maza. Provoke us not.

I will not hence, and you shall hear me. Maza. Go, y'are impudent. Clean. Am I so Sir? You did not tell me so, when I did waste Whole Nights, and spent my Spirits, to seduce The People t' your party, and lost my blood To serve you. I was not thenâ Maza. Stir not in me An Anger that will shake thee. Clean. Whose head, whose heart, whose hand appear'd till mine, To make you what you are? Maza. If we be King, Sir you shall feel there is A power belonging to't. Wher's our Guard? Take him away. Phili. I beseech your Majesty. Clean. Effeminate Lord, I scorn to own a life At thy Petitioning. Tyrant do thy worst. Is this the reward for all my servicesâ Sit with your crew of Vaulters, and Contrive To turn your Cittadels to dauncing schools Or Stews fit for your purpose, till the Souldiery Like to a sudden Tempest scour your follies, And whip you to Repentance. Maza. Away with him. Guard. Come my Lord. Clean. Yes I shall goâUngratefull Prince, May all thy Brothersâ [drag him off Maza. Stop's mouthâaway with him. So we are rid of th' Screech Owle, did you e'r hear Spleen better vented; All the Physicians of Palermo could not discover his disease better than he has don't himself. Phil. And were I as your Majesty, I'd cure him By th'head for!t. Maza. 'Tis not safe yet, but if this Tame him not, We shall fly higher, Phili. The Serpent spet at me too. Maza. Wee'l have the venom from him or his life for't. Adul. Hee has a Daughter of that Beauty, would thaw a Stoick's bosome, She carries the Quintessence of Youth about her. Maza. Art thou acquainted with her? Adul. Though I am not, I want not Confidence, If that may serve your Majesty. Maza. Is she compos'd for Mirth? Adul. She bears a fame for Vertue. Maza. What should we do with her then? she is no Match for us. Adul. If your Majesty have a Minde to her I'l batter all her Vertues with your Glories; And 'less an Hoast of Angels come to Guard her, She shall not pass my purchase. Phili. When you Storm her let not a Repulse or two Make you draw off your Siege, the third Assault Constrains her to Surrender. Adul. I am not my Lord To learn the Art of Courtship, I have more Designes than one upon her. Maza. We do like The Law Lycurgus made, and will Ordain The like amongst us; why should Youth be Curtail'd Of that delight Nature intended it? Mens Wives shall have the liberty to choose A friend to play the Husbands part sometimes. Phili. Does your Majesty intend to Marry? Maza. Marriage is but a Church Divise, that would Prefer sobriety amongst the Vertues, A stale unsavoury thing; when as Variety Gives life to every Sense, and doth beget An Appetite, when tother smothers it. Adulanter try thy Skill, We shall reward it. Adul. I warrant she's your Majesties. Maza. Come Philistus, Wee'l bring thee on thy way, and lest Missellus Should prove stiffe Neck'd, and not yield his Obedience To our Commands, our Generall shall send With thee 5000. men to force Admittance. Leontium, Tyche and Neapolis Stand fast to us, and will assist you if The Siracusians should stand out. Phili. Your Majesty does enrich me with your Bounty. Maza. Adulanter, We shall finde imployment worthy Thy liking in Palermo; We will have Thee neer us. Adul. Your Highness Vassall. Maza. 'Tis fit, Royality should maintain them which uphold it. Exeunt. Enter Agathocles and Epecides. Agath. He is my King, his Brother's death hath made His Title good, and I must bring my heart Down to Obedience. Epeci. Then you begin to cool. Agath. I'm not Convinc'd in Conscience that 'tis lawfull T' oppose the power now o'r us, since the hand Of Heaven is in't, whose high Decrees we ought not To question or dispute. Enter Archias. Epeci. A happy Morning Toth' Noble Lord Archias. Archi. The like to your Honours. You heard the news? Epec. What is't my Lord? Arch. Philistus is made Provinciall of Vallis de Noto. Epec. How likes Cleander it? Archi. He's otherwise Provided for, Committed Upon displeasure Mazares has ta'ne against him. Epec. That's news indeed. Agat. What Cleander, the Magazine of Policy, Is he blown up? Mazares only Atlas That shoulder'd him into the Throne. Epec. This is some State Gin, some trick Politick. Archi. Beleev't 'tis true. Epe. How can Mazares be without him? Archi. Oh my Lord, Mazares us'd Cleander as the Lame Do their supporting Crutches, that's no longer Than as they need 'em; when that they are able To walk alone, they cast 'em from 'em. Agath. Ha, ha, ha, I'm glad on't with all my heart. Mazares never Acted a thing as yet So neer Commendable justice, Fair Astrea May give it a just Plaudit. Arch. But Consider, If such who have ventur'd their part of Heaven To do him service, are not free from's Tyranny, Where rests our safety? Epe. It is high injustice So to reward him. Agath. In the survey of Politickes, Dost find a Traytor otherwise rewarded? Stands it with thy Discretion, to let loose A Tyger, when th'ast mov'd him into Anger? No, 'tis a way both safe and full of Justice To Chain such Danger up; had he done otherwise, He had bin fitter rather to have rul'd A Sheephook than a Scepter. Arc. Come you are too bitter, Think on Cleander's Age, and lend your aid. Agath. He should have known more vertue in his Youth, And then his Age had now bin Tempest proof. Arch. For my sake good my Lord, and for his Daughters. Agath. I, now my Lord you speak, you are concern'd in't. Arch. Your own, and all our freedoms are concern'd in't. Shall we pay Duty and Obedience To him, who does instruct us to Rebell By his own President? are we to learn How he Obtain'd the Scepter? or want we Sense To feel how he imploies it? was it not His own insinuating Tenet to The People, ('gainst his Brother,) That the Vertue And Justice of the Prince were th' onely Bonds That bound the People to him, and when he Should violate either, they were ty'd no longer? Are we not Freemen then? Epeci. Highly requisite. Arch. Where is the Common Right? Our Just Inheritance? bought with the blood Of our Indulgent Ancestors? whose Valour Bounded the Royall Power so, it durst not Spread beyond th' Acts of Piety and Justice. [Enter Archbishop. Agath. See what Love, and Women can do! Archi. My Lord Archbishop you are happily come To Contribute your advice. Archb. My honour'd Lords, The safety of your Persons frees my Soul That lately was a Slave to fear, and Jealousie. Agath. I Churchman, 'twas your Feares, and Jealousies, Heav'd first at our foundation. Cicily had bin Cleer from infection, had not your hot lungs Spet the Contagion, It was you gave Reines To the Licentious People, that Like Negroes Shot their envenom'd Darts at th' Raies of Majesty, Whose carefull heat did warm 'em. Archb. You mistake, Wee aim'd at no such thing, but to discharge Our Duties to our Country. Agath. And y'ave prov'd The most undutifull'st of all her Children. And finding now the ends of your Ambition Of being Cardinall is cleer laid open, By which your Pride is like to be Obscur'd, You do begin to belch forth fresh Sedition, And Create new Distempers, 'cause Mazares Will not do what you'd have him. Archb. I come not Sir To bandy words, the World knowes what I did Was in Relation to the Churches Peace, How e'r you term it; But so full of Poyson I find the Gilded Pils of his Professions, That plainly I must tell you without fear, I heartily do wish those hands that were Imploy'd to Seat him o'r us, had bin us'd To put him in his Grave. Arc. Or bin lop'd off Before they had Contracted such an ill Upon our Countrey. Epe. Ther's no time too late To lanch the Ulcer and give ease unto The groaning People, if my Lord Agathocles Will call to Mind his death, that whets the Instrument, Whose Precious Memory will give life to all Our undertakings. Archi. Come, my Lord, I'l have The Bishop and you reconcil'd. Wee'l to Cleanders house, where the poor Lady Mourns Her Fathers Absence, there we will Consult On some way to Obtain his and our Fteedoms. Agath. Let not the Church-man be in it, and then Doubt not but we shal make all right agen. Exeunt. Enter Adulanter and 3. or 4. Souldiers. Adul. This is her walk, I hope you doe not faint At the Design, now 'tis so neer attempting. 1 Sould. Yes I warrant you, as though she were the first Wench we have had Occasion to make use of. 2. Soul. Why what do you take us to be? Milksops, I tel you Sir, we are Gentlemen in the first place, Souldiers in the second, and men in the last place. Adulan. Good reason the last should take place of the first then; but stay, Yonders the Bird for which we wait, I'l try [Enter Harmonia. If she will come to hand, if not, your Net Shall noose her into Tamenessâstand close. Hail Madam, Heaven's Epitome, on whose Blest smiles the happinesse of Kings depend, Pleasure and health attend you. Harm. I thank you Sir, But here it is unseasonable where sorrow Has it's Predominance. Adul. I bring you Comfort, If you but please to honour the Address With kind Acceptance. Harm. Has my Ruthlesse fortune More Miseries to heap on me, that she Presents me with such shadows of her favour? Adula. The King, to whom your Father's life is forfeit, Throws both it, and his own into your lap If you will be so wise as to receive 'em. Harm. Could I express a thankfulness beyond The Duty that I owe 'n my Prayers for him, It should fly to him, pray be pleas'd to teach me The way to it. Adul. Fame has bin busie In giving to the King an Estimat Of your Perfections, whose high Value fils Th' Exchequor of his Breast, and 'tis your Love Must free the Heart your Bounty has subdu'd. Harm. I'm ignorant of your meaning. Adul. To be his Mistres. Harm. Or in plainer Terms, which shews the truth on't, To be his Whore. Adul, Fy; that is too Common; Consider Madam, he that Courts you is Your King, who may Compell where he intreats, And you will forfeit your Allegiance if You should deny him. Har. To the Gods I should, Durst I presume to Grant it; if my Father Must not enjoy his life, but on the Terms Of my dishonour, th'duty that I ow To Heaven and Goodness will Implead against The Bonds of Nature, which can Challenge but The life it gave, and that I'l offer up To Ransome his. Adulan. That will not serve the turn, You must to Court. Harm. I'l first go to my grave. Adu. Nay then adue Complement, and to your businesse fellows. Har. What mean you? Adu. To hide your Blushes Madam. Har. Help, help, help. They throw a silk bag over her, shee strives with them, they stop her mouth with a Glove, and bind her hands and feet. Adul. Stop her mouth. Enter Agathocles, Archias, Epecides and Archbishop. Agath. I am o'rcome in Reason, and do Crave Your Lordships pardon. Archb. My Lord you have my Heart At your disposing. Archi. This Reconcilement's handsome. Adu. So, the field's our own, take up your Bag and Baggage, March fair and softly, When wee come to Court wee'l share the Booty. As they are carrying her away they meet the Lords, they cast her down and run back. A Plague upon't, down with your load, and make an Honourable Retreat. Exeunt. Arch. 'Twas Adulanterâwhat's this, It moves, Unbinds her, takes the Glove out of her mouth. Your help my Lords,âAh! 'tis Harmonia. Archb. What Monstrous Stratagem had they upon her? Harmo. Air is a Blessing, oh, let me have more on't. Arch. Dear Madam speak your wrongs, and wee will right you, If the best blood in Cicily can do't. Harm. My life, and Honour, (far more precious) were Design'd for Slaughter. Agath. How Madam! by whom? Harm. By him who should protect the Innocent, The Lawless King; whose Causeless wrath upon My Father, nothing could appease unless I made sale of my Vertue, and my Youth To satisfie his Lust, Arch. Whose fire wee'l quench With his own blood; be confident Harmonia Thy Father shall outlive his Power and Cruelty. Agath. If we take not this edge off, We shall have Our Wives and Daughters made the Subjects of Our scorn and shame, and be squeek'd out in Ballads For honourable Cuckolds, Princely Panders. Whose Soul is so besotted to his fear He can contract it to a Minutes Patience? Archbi. Not I. Epec. Nor I; sure he does think the Gods Are all asleep, or have forgot to punish. Arc. Hence Patience, thou Fools vertue, I'l shake off Thy Coldness, with the Witchcraft of Obedience, Who have so long kept me in Cels of Slavery I could not see the Glory of my Freedom. Agath. Wee'l kindle all our Vigour :t thy flame, And teach our knees to Pay their homage to No Power but thine; My Lords if that wee be All of one Minde, cry, long live Archias. Arch. I wait not for that Dignity beleeve me, All my Ambition is to free this Lady From th' gastly feares that haunt her, and give liberty Unto her happiness, by her Fathers Freedome. Archb.

At last a Remnant Of my poor friends, Resolv'd to pay their last Service unto my Memory, though with The loss of their Estates and lives, did lay Plots to destroy me as the horrid Murtherer, And I, not daring to open my self To them, for fear I should let in the fury Of my stern Adversaries, did steal away With the Nights silence.

If my desires effect but what they aim at, I care not when, or how, 'tis purchased. Haste you with the Kings Letter to Missellus, Tell him 'tis my desire to keep the League Of friendship 'twixt us, and without a bussle, Which may let forth some blood, have him Surrender; Tell him, 'tis no displeasure that the King Has tane against him, that occasions his, But to give ease unto his Age, and draw Him neerer him at Court, where he shall find The service of his Youth, in's latter daies Crown'd with a peacefull Lawrel, and content Ad length unto his yeers. Phila. I go my Lord. Exit Philander. Phili. Thimistius, March fair and softly, we shall be Too soon upon e'm els; this cannot but Insinuate a faith into him, to Give way to my Admittance, since the offer Carries so full a sense of fairness in't.

Let the Fates Contrive their worst against it, if Antanter Bring us supplies from the Provinciall Of Mona, we will fire it but wee'l have it. Thimist. Well, my Lord, the Craft's in th' Catching. Exeunt. Enter Missellus, Philander, and Attendants. Misse. Dost come to dare me Fellow? Phila. I conceive With favour of your Excellence, the Terms Are very Civill, and no danger in e'm. Misse.

Which you might have preserv'd upon his shoulders, Had you given but regard unto my Counsell. But you are Lordly-wise, and cause you can Batter a Ladies fort with your fine Rhetorick, You think the Town's your own, and men are bound To bend unto your Complement, or trust The Glass of your deceipt. Phil. 'Tis fine, affronted By Greasie Buffe and Bisket. Thim. Some strong Water To keep the thing from fainting, poor Young Man, How pale he looks upon't. Phili. Take thy reward. [Pistols him. Sould.

Let me have better Language or by Heaven I'l make you as tame as these. Ant. You cannot Sir. Phili. How? Anta.

Take up Thimistius body, it shall have An honourable buriall, as for his Let it remain a sport for th'Siracusians. The King I know will run besides himself To hear on's Minions loss, but you I hope, My friends and fellow Souldiers, will wade with me Through all the Lakes of danger. Sould. Wee'l never leave you. Anta. Bravely resolv'd, and I will die with you. Exeunt. Enter Missellus and Souldiers. Misse. Th'are march'd away; what's here Philistus body, Our late Competitor? Why here's revenge Strangely effected! See the fate of Traytors! How wonderfully Heaven does bring about Their Punishment! that like to Caniballs The one doth eat the other; bring it in; My hate ends with his Life, and now my Charity, Though he deserv'd it not, will give him buriall. Exeunt. Archias, Agathocles, Epecides Cleander, Icetis, pass over the Stage. The people follow, crying an Archias, an Archias, an Archias. Enter Mazares, Adulanter, and Attendants. Adul. Their Envy is Invincible, and the People (Time's Shittle-cocks) do bring unto your Gates The hidious Shape of danger. Maza. My deceipt Shall Rock that Monster into sleep, had it More eyes than Argos. Adul. 'Tis impossible, The Agrigentines have thrown off Obedience; Monreall is revolted; All your Castles And strongs holds in Palermo are deliver'd Into their hands; the Magistrates joyn with them. Maza. Go use thy best Endeavours Adulanter T'appease the People, turn right Courtier, promise, And wee'l perform at Leasure. Adul. Your Highness I hope is not in Earnest; I go amongst 'em! Have you a Mind to have my Braines beat out? I am your Pimp they say, (Sir,) am so hated, The very Boys throw Turap tops at me. Maza. Alas poor Adulanter, we will blow This Storme away ne'r fear it. Let our Guard Be doubled, till we can send t' Hermocrates To bring his Forces hither: If the Traytors Come not too suddenly upon us, We Will turn the poyson'd Darts they'd throw at us 'Gainst their own Bosomes. They do play with fire Till it Consume 'em. Adul. They like Moales have work'd In darkness all this while, to set the Kingdome In such a flame that might both Perish you And all your friends. Maza. Fire sooner may dissolve The Adamant, the Parched Negroes strike Through th'Battlements of Heaven. Wee are above The reach of Malice, Fortune is Oblieg'd To wait upon our Merit, and our Influence Can in a breath dispierce their proud Designes, As Winds divest the Trees of Leaves. Let fear Dwell among Fooles 't shall have no Harbour here. Exeunt. Enter Archias, Archbishop, Agathocles, Epecides, Souldiers. Archi. Leave it to me, I'l do the business Gentlemen. Archb. 'Tis not discretion to expose your Person So unconcern'd in this; 'tis we, the People, Whose wrongs infer the Cause. Arch. Which I must manage. Y'ave made me your Protector, and Revenger, Which I'l perform, did Gloomy Magick Guard him; Or were he wrapt in Air, or hid in some Dark Cavern of the Earth, my Heart grown big Like Dire Revenging Thunder would make through The bodies of them both to find him out. Agathoc. Our lives shall wait on yours through dangers mouth. Sould. An Archias, an Archias. Exeunt. Enter Mazares and Adulanter. Adul. They have surpriz'd the Guards, and are upon us. Maza.

They'l hang me Sir, and I've no Mind at this time To such a death. Maza. Trifle not away The time, they will not; go, leave us. Adul. Well, If I chance to swing, pray Heaven I may Have Heart enough to bear it. Maza. Injurious Fate, for all the pride thou tak'st In my destruction thus I will imbrace thee. Takes the sword off the Table, kisses it. Mischiefes like waves tumble o'r one another, To beat themselves upon me, and th'are welcome; This passes me through all. Poor ignorant soules That start at Death, and think him terrible! His shape appears to me worthy the Courting; And like my Friend I kisse him; on this Point [kisses the sword. He shewes himself most lovely, deck'd, with all The Ornaments of honour Fame can give him. Thus I salute thee, thus again I greet thee, [Opens his doublet. And thus I offer up a heart unto thee: A heart, thy Terror cannot tame, 'tis Love Of thy sweet fellowship o'rcomes me, not A fear to meet thee, that, my Soul disdaines. Mazares dwell not on delaies, be high In thy Resolves, as thou hast liv'd so die. [Throws himself upon his sword. Oh, I have prevented you. [fals. A great shout within. Enter Archias, Archbishop, Agathocles, Epecides, Souldiers. Archi. And I Envy thy death in that I lose The glory of saving of thy life. Maza. Which must have lasted But Pageant-like two daies upon your Triumphs, And my shame bin perpetuall. Archb. Do you find Any remorse within you? does the wrongs Y'ave offer'd to the Gods in pulling down Their Temples and their Altars work upon you Any shew of repentance? Maza. Thou Church-Glow-worm, Who dost pretend a heat of Zeal, yet art Colder than th'Alpes in Charity, if prov'd; My Enmity to thee gives strength unto me, And I couldâbut Ã´ I fail, this my death Shall prove a Monument to my GloryâFarewell. Enter a Souldier with Adulanter. Sould. Here is another of the crew. Arch. Hang him up. Adul. Who me Sir? I ne'r dreamt of ill against you, have pray'd as heartily for you as for any Man living; for I may speak a proud word, I never prayed in my life. I hope my mother brought me up better than so, to be hang'd. Cleand. Let me beseech your pardon for him, alas He is not worth your Justice, and may prove Usefull hereafterâto me [aside. Arch. Noble Father, For so wee must bee taught to call you, you Have greater power upon us than this Grant; 'Tis yours as soon as ask'd. Adula. Heaven bless the King. Arch. Take up Mazares body, his rites over, The next thing wee shall doe, is to perform Our Vowes made to the Gods, and take Harmonia Your Daughter to our Bed. Cleand. And the next thing [aside.

As for the other, his Competitor, A black Cloud of Debauchness and leud Vices Ecclips his Valour, and gives us Occasion To looke upon Antanter as more worthy Of such a Charge, whose Virtue is our Warrant.

I thought it then high time to overtake His Mounting-pride, and Levell 't with the Earth; And not to let him grow more fruitfull in His sin, and overtopping Insolency. Agath. It was a Deed Antanter that deserves To live in th' Mouth of Fame, that after Ages From thence may learn not to fear bug-bear-greatness. Anta. Thimistius body I gave buriall, and Left tothers to Misselluses disposall. Agath. 'Twas no small sport to him, but it was strange Planetius should deny Assistance to him. Anta. I do beleeve Missellus and he held A Correspondency, but for what end I cannot reach. Agath. He is not to be trusted; If this distemper once would leave the King Thou would'st not think't a Miracle to see Enter Epecides. Me in Planetius Seate. Now Epecides How fares the King? Epec. Oh Gentlemen, our hopes That promised a Growing-happiness From his indulgent Beames, One Minute has Destroi'd for ever. Agath. How do you mean my Lord? Epec. The King is poyson'd. Antan. How Poyson'd! Poyson'd? Agath. There is a secret Devill lurks among us, Who holds Intelligence with Hell to blast Our Kingdomes Peace and Comfort; see, they come.

Great Sir, be not an Enemy Unto your Being, take this asâ Arch. Away, You may as well give Phisick to the dead, As to his Heart whose agony exceeds The sense of Ease; I am resolv'd to take No more of your vain helps; leave me I pray. Cleander. Clean. My most Gracious Souveraign, I have a heart too weak to bear the burthen Of so much Wo, your sufferings bear me down Beneath the hope of Comfort. Arch. Spare thy Griefe; Harmonia treads the Milkie way, and I Must through this fire, be purifi'd to meet Her and the Joyes she brings me. Agath. Does none hear By whom, or how these Miseries should come? Archi. Trouble not your self (my Lord) I freely Pardon And will reward the Doer, so declare it, For he has taken paines to send me to The Place I so much long'd for; I do charge you (If my last words may win Obedience from you) Straight to Proclaim this; fain I would salute him Him e'r I die, that was so kind unto me. Archbi. Unheard of Charity. Arch. My Lord from you I have conceiv'd in Specie the joyes I must receive hereafter; those sweet Odours Perfume my Sprituall sense, and strengthen that, Although my Temporall decay and perish.

Archb. The King calls Sir. Archi. I feel my vitals fail me, Oh Cleander I shall see my Harmonia, thy blest Daughter, E'r fourty Minutes pass, I must bequeath thee A Legacy of Care, this drooping Kingdom. My Lords I hope the love you ever bore me (Though Heaven denies me time to Merit it) Will now express it selfe in the approving Him I present to you, a dying Man Who has no ends upon you, nor the Kingdom, Farther than your perpetuall flourishing. Clea. I beseech your Grace,âalasâ Arch. You hear me Lords. Archb. We do Sir, and accept the choice Y'ave made, With more than willingness. Agath. You have not spoke for me. Exit. Epeci. Nor me. Exit. Archi. I am at rest, farewell. [dies. Archb. Hee's dead. Clean. And I His weeping Monument remains till Fate Translates my better part t' a better State. Exeunt. Antan. These are fine turning times, I wonder when 'Twill come to my turn to be King, I have A Heart as fit, and large, and dare as far Adventure for't as any, But the Fates Of Souldiers serve to Promote others ends, Which done, they do forget we e'r were friends. Exit. Enter Agathocles, Epecides, Hipparinus, Icetis. Hippa. Your words sound like the Oracle's, as full Of truth, and plainer to the Intellect. Agath. How sweet and freely Rome enjoy'd her self, 'Till she submitted to the Power and pride Of one mans Rule? Tell me what good did ever Kings bring unto our Country, that wee might not Have purchased without e'm? Ills they have Almost incredible; Our Coffers emptied, To fill their Treasury, and maintain their Riot. Epe. And wedded to perpetuall Slavery. For when one Tyrant falls another Rises From his Corrupted Loynes, that proves far worse Perhaps than did the former, So that wee Must never hope for better, but be Arm'd With Patience to endure the worst. Agath. Suppose We would allow of Kingly Power, where is The Man discended from that Race? Cleander He was but one of us the other day; And sure we are not of so tame a brood, But to think We deserv't as well as he. Why should not you Icetis, or Hipparinus Rule, or thou, Epecides, or my self? W'are of as good a Mould, and have as much T'elate us, as his Worship. Epeci. Very right. And have as great an Intrest in the People And Common-wealth; this of Necessity Must breed Confusion 'mongst us, this Example Kindles in every Man desire of Rule, Which to Atchieve, how perilous so e'r Th' Attempt may prove, they'l leave no means unsought, Till their irregular Sense, spurning at Order, Turns all into a Chaos. Agath. Who can tell But this Intruder was th' efficient Cause Of his own Daughters ruin, and the Kings. Epec. It was a notable peece of Policy To kill the Apothecary and prevent Confession. Icet. What's your advice? Agath. To joyn with us, And take th'Peoples Yoke off from the Tyranny Of Kings hereafter. Epec. And to have our Countrey Govern'd by three or ten, as did the Romans. Agat. Who shall continue but a Yeer in Power, And then successive Patriots be chosen, Who shall have Power to punish in their time The Crimes their Predecessors did commit During their time of Rule. Epec. So shall the People Not be to seek for Justice, but find ease Unto their grievances, and the vile Minds Of Avaritious and Ambitious Men Be either punished, or els Rebated. Icet. It cannot but content the People highly, 'Tis Coppied from so fair a President. Hippa. And with you, and for you, and them, wee'l spend Our lives and fortunes. Agath. We will do the like With you, and for you, and thus link'd together, [imbrace. We dare Contemn Cleander's Power. Epeci. And blow His Glorious hopes into the Air. Agath. Be sudden, And we may take the Serpent in his Cell; But our delaies may give the Monster time Of comming forth, and strength to overcome us. Hippa. We will possess the People with the Glory Of their long hidden liberties, with promise Or Restauration, if it lies within The power of friends, Money, or life to Compass. Agat. He that's besotted to his fear, or Ease, Will make his Patience prove his worst disease. Exeunt. Enter Planetius and a Captain. Plan. Return m' Obedience to the King Evander. And this unto Missellus, tell him I [gives him a Paper. With all the force that Mona can afford me Will wait upon his Highness and himself At Erix. Capt. I shall my Lord. [Exit Captain. Plan. How am I Bound to the Gods for their superlative goodness, That here an offering of Mercy meets me By their Dictation; I whose Treachery Unto my King Merits severest Justice, Am punished with a Revengless Pardon, Which is indeed my Torment, that I should Ever have bin so wicked 'gainst a Prince Deserves so much good from me, but my Soul Henceforth shall cleave fast to this Principle, âThe longer growth Diseases do indure, âThe more the Griefe, more famous is the Cure. Exit. Enter Hipparinus, Icetis, and the People casting up their Caps, crying Liberty, Liberty. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT 5. SCE. I. Enter Agathocles, Epecides, Hipparinus, Icetis, Antanter, and the People hawling Cleander. Clean. Traytors, hands off, 'tis Sacrilege to use The Person of your King with such Irreverence. Omnes. Our Kingâha ha ha. People. Wee'l make you sing another Song. Clea. Have I deserv'd so ill, that none wil give A Death more honourable to me? Agath. Thou hast liv'd Base, and must basely die. Clean. Forgive me Heaven, And you bright Stars whose Lustre I Ecclipse Here, to shine brighter there, Plead not against me, But be as Mercifull as you are Innocent. Agath. Wert thou the death of Archias and thy Daughter? Clea. Ambition was, to which I gave consent, Agath. And now you see the Pinacle from which You must be tumbled down, away with him. Clean. Yet hear me. People. Confession's ti'd to Destiny, you shall with us. [People drag him in. Agat. You see the desperate effects that wait On this thing called Monarchy, because It carries a continuance, and all Men Naturally have an Ambition to Make great their line, and families by succession; When ours doth blunt the Edge of such Resolves; And no Man, were it not for th' Common good, Would entertain the Office, being rather A Place of care than Profit, in the which Men must so square their Actions, they may be Able to stand the Peoples questioning, When as their time of Government's expir'd. Epec. It is not so with Monarchy, Kings may Commit what Outrages they please upon The People, and none dare so much as think They have done ill. Enter a Fellow. Fell. If you please to walk that way You may see Cleander swinging for his life. Hipp. Oh by all meanes let's go. Antan. It may be he may confess something more. Exeunt. Enter Evander, Missellus, and Souldiers. Evan. My Peoples troubles do afflict me more Than all the wrongs and injuries they've done me. Miss. The Gods had lost their Attribute of Just, Had they not punish'd them with these Convulsions, Whose fits direct their Sense unto the ruine They've brought upon themselves now at their doors. Evan. Good Heaven divert it, I shall be more Chary In spilling of their blood than of my own; And I shall thinke it greater honour to me (In purchasing my own) to have my Temples Surrounded with a peacefull Garland than Obtain it by the Victory and Slaughter Of my poor Subjects. Missell. 'Tis your mercy Sir, Enter Planetius and Souldiers, Planetius kneels. With which you overflowâhere is Planetius. Plan. I offer at your Highness feet a life That has long since bin forfeited. Evan. The which I give thee back; live to deserve my favour. Plan. I would I could recover so much time, As I have lost, to ad unto the daies I'm yet to spend, to serve you, this your Mercy Does come so neer the temper of the Gods, Fame cannot but record it. Evan. Has our Subjects The knowledge that we live? Pla. I did dispierce it Through all the parts of Mona: Evan. And how took they it? Pla. Miraculously; but so, I might discover Their Joy was unexpressible. Evan. Wee'l have Our Pardon (as we March) Proclam'd to all Will come in to us; Clemency not force Befits a King, Rigour makes People worse. Sould. Heaven bless the King. March Gentlemen. Exeunt. Enter Antanter, and Souldiers pass over the Stage, then, Enter Agathocles. Agath. 'Tis brave to be a King, his spirit's low And base as Earth, that knows not how to use The Power the Fates have put into his hands, And will accept of less; damn 'annuall Rule, Shall I who dare do more than kill a thousand, Be Subject to the questioning of ten? The People have put me in power, and I Will make my best advantage on't; it is But Justice to break faith with faithless Men. Give me the Nod that strikes a trembling in The stiffe-neck'd People, and does make 'em keep A distance and a duty; ther's no Glory Like being Singular, hence idle honesty That sleep'st thy time away, and art ador'd By none but empty Sculls and tatter'd Jerkins, There's no such thing as vertue in thy Rags. That, we prize to be vertuous and good Merits its Estimation. Welcome Greatness, Vertue resides with thee. My hopes by this [a shout within. Are by Antanter perfected, hee's here; Enter Antanter and Souldiers. Now my best Genius tell me how much I stand indebted to thee, is it done? Antan. Done to a hair Sir, We surpriz'd 'm suddenly, Truss'd up the Magistrates to whom y'ad promis'd Such glorious freedome, who did curse and swear At Death and Destiny. The Forts and Castles Are all our own, and now we safely may, Cry with one voice, long live Agathocles. [Souldiers cry long live Agathocles. Agat. How shall I make requitall for this Project Which thou hast more than form'd, perform'd so bravely? I will Create thee Arch-Duke of Palermo, And when I die, will leave the Kingdom to thee. Anta. But give me leave I pray SirâIn whose Power Lies it to make me Duke? Agat. In mine, whose else? Am I not thy King. Anta. Pray who made you so? Agath. The Gods. Anta. Pray which of them? Have I bin Idle. Agath. No, Dear Antanter no; It was thy hand Directed by the Gods that made me King. Antan. Then 'twas my hand directed by the Gods That made you King. Agath. Right, right Antanter. Anta. And now my hand directed by the Gods, Will you un-King?âtake him into your Charge. Agath. How? Anta. Very right Sir, Charity begins At home, and I'm not such an Ass to stand To your reward, when I can pay my self. Agat. What dost thou mean? Ant. To be what you would be, That is, a King, Agat. A King? of what? Anta. Of better men than thou artâ'tis a wrong Unto our Honour to hold Parley with thee. Off with his Head; It is a Death more Noble Than you bestow'd upon Cleander Sir, Or Order'd for Icetis, or the Magistrate. Agat. But do you hear Sir King. Ant. Obey our Willâ And Sir, say y'are well dealt with. Agat. Hell take you And your dealing too; Heaven is thus just With such as fal from Vertue to their Lust. Exeunt with Agathocles. Anta. So, he is gone, fallen in the Trap he laid For th' Magistrates, whom I have but secur'd, Till they allow my Power, or dye by it. The Title King's indifferent to me, Give me th' essentiall part, and let the shadow Vanish, and be forgot. What had this Lord More in him of a man, to draw Obedience Than I, except his Title? and that had not Vertue enough to save him from my wrath. It is not birth, or blood, but thou dear Instrument, [to his sword. That can defend, offend, raise or dis-seate High Potentates, and mak a Beggar great. Be thou auspicious Armed Mars to me, And I'l adore no other Gods but thee. Enter a Captain. Capt. The Generall hearing of these distractions, Has drawn his Army this way, and puts in For title to the Kingdom. Ant. Though he was My Generall once, I'l scourge him into duty, And make him know his distance, we will meet him. Leave what force you can possibly allow Here, to secure the People and the Garrisons Now in our Custody, lest they Revolt, Or become Mutineers, Hermocrates, Shall finde as tuffe a bus'ness on't, as e'r The Wars afforded him; Give double pay To such as will come in to us, and leave His Party, since, that I am in, I'l through, Though th' Kingdoms treasury bleed for't, and lean famin Feed on the People, 'till there scarce are left The Image of a Man alive; 'twere base Now to Retreat; fear gives a Coward place. Exeunt. Enter Hermocrates, Captain, and Souldiers, Hermo. Is't possible Antanter dares do this. Capt. Agathocles is beheaded, Hipparinus With th' rest of th' Magistrates of Palermo and The Governour Icetis are secur'd. The Forts and Castles all are in his Power, And has surpriz'd the Treasury. Herm. A brave fellow: How long thinks he to keep this? I do wonder Missellus or Planetius stir not 'bout it: But they indeed are such known enemies To one another, neither of them dare Peep forth, lest tother be upon his back. Capt. I know your Excellency will be the Man Must make the Souldier flourish and be happy. Herm. I and Atanter are the only Men I see must go to Cudgels for't. Capt. Alas, Our force will scatter his, as Northerne winds Disperse the leaves in Autumn. Herm. But he has Th' advantage by the Treasury, and Mony Will purchase Men, and friendship. Capt. Victory Will draw them all to us, I hope there is not A Man amongst us so in love with's life, But he will sacrifice it for your Excellence; What say you Gentlemen? Sould. Our lives are his. Hermoc. I thank you fellow Souldiers; Arm'd with you, I dare Oppose the Destinies. He down, The Guerdon of our Conquest is a Crown. Exeunt. Enter Evander, Missellus, Planetius, Souldiers. Evan. How poor and bare's this Province made? we scarce Can get Provision for our Men and Horse. Plan. But we are neer the City of Monreall, An that was wont t' abound with all Provision. Evan. Have you inform'd th' Archbishop and the Magistrates That we are drawing towards them, Misse. We have By by your Express, and wonder that wee hear No sooner from them. Enter Archbishop, Epecides, Magistrates. Archb. Disobedient Guilt Throwes me thus low for Mercy. Evan. Here, rise up. [lends his hand. Archb. Distracted shame so overcomes me Sir, I cannot look your Highness in the face. Evan. Return unto your Vertue, and we shall Be happy in your friendship. Epecides How dost thou relish us? Epeci. As I would Sir, The Author of my Being, Peace, and happiness. My Soul has wander'd all this while, and now, With you, it is return'd to its first Station. Evan. But what has brought thee to Monreall? tell me. Epeci. After Cleander's death, my friend Agathocles, Whose brest I thought had bin so Mann'd with Vertue Ambition could not batter it, compli'd With th' Souldiery, of which Antanter was The Chiefe, to put the Magistrates to death, No sooner that Antanter had secur'd The Forts and Castles, and made all his own, But he begins to fall off from his Bargain With the new King, and to himself does give A Law to take his head off, and indeed No Man could promise to himself a safety, Unless he did submit unto his Power, To which I knew I could not bend my Heart, And therefore for self-Preservation made Bold with my Lord Archbishop. Evan. What is that Antanter, whose Audaciousness is so Destructive to our Peace? Plane. He was an Officer Under Hermocrates Mazares Generall. Archb. And now they both are tugging to undo The Kingdom, and from eithers Ruine to Raise to the Victor Glory. Evan. Ah poor Cicily, How hast thou been beaten and banded to Promote the ends of turbulent Spirited Men? My Lords while they are striving for the Mastery, What if we fell upon them? Misse. Very requisite. Evan. Let us bee private in't and do it suddenly, But first wee'l have a Baiting at your house. Archb. You Highness will enrich me with the favour. Exeunt. Drums, Trumpets, &amp;c. Enter the Party of Hermocrates driving Antanters Party before them, then Antanter enters and rescues his Party, beats the others off; Hermocrates enters with fresh supplies and beats them in: Then enter at one door Hermocrates, at the other Antanter. Her. Have I singl'd thee? Antan. Sir know y'are Sawcy, We use to keep at distance with such fellowes. Hermo. 'Tis likely; to come neer us may prove dangerous. Anta. Fellow th'ast greater honour done thee now Than e'er the Wars bestow'd on thee, thou grappl'st With no less than a King. Herm. Of Kitchin-stuffe. Anta. I'l make thee do thy duty. [fight, Her. That's to beat you. [wounds him. What will you take Sir for your Kingdom, now? Anta. Your Head and Quarters Sir to fix on th' Gates. Her. And this next touch to boot. [wounds him again. Anta. 'sDeath, I think 've fool'd away my Courage; How do you now Sir? [Hermocrates wounded. Herm. As well as e'r I did Sirâhave I reach'd you? [Antan. wounded. Anta. Your Arm's to short, and your Aim worse; By Heaven, Had'st thou Indented with the Fates to live But for a Minute longer, thus I'd cancel it [wounds him. Herm. And thus I meet thy Resolution. Fall both on one another, being down they strive with one another A great shout within. Enter Evander, Missellus, Archbishop, Planetius, Epecides, and Souldiers. Evan. Give Order for the Magistrates Enlargement. Hermo. Ah, how my Fate afflicts me with fresh Torments? Evander living? Anta. Whose Injuries lie heavy Upon our Soules; most gracious Sir how e'r Our lives have been disturbance to your Kingdom, In Death with you and it we sue for Peace; Forgiveness Royall Sir. Evan. We come not to Possess our own with thoughts to bee Reveng'd, Or if we did, you have escap'd it, Heaven Forgive you as we do. Herm. May never Forraign Or home-bred Jars wither your Peacefull Lawrel. Anta. And thus our Enmity does end; thy hand. [kisses it. Herm. Thy cheekâfarewell. [dies. Antan. Plenty and Peace perpetually dwell among youâ [dies. Planeti. Two as brave Spirits As e'r Cicily bred. Enter Icetis, Hipparinus, Magistrates. Epeci. The Magistrates are here Sir. Icet., Hipp. At your feet, Royall Sir we fall. Evan. Rise in our favour. Icet. Your Mercy has no President. Eva. Heaven make you stronger in your faith and duties Hereafter to us, what is past We Pardon. Hipp. All th' lowring Aspects of Malignant Stars, That lately threatn'd ruin to this Kingdom, Are at your Glorious Presence sunk beneath Their primitive Conceptions. Evan. Take up those bodies. My Lords, with your assistance we must do A cure upon the Kingdom, in the seating Its dislocated joynts; we shall not take Notice hereafter who amongst you have Had hands in her impairing, but receive you With no less favour than the rest, not doubting But that the smart you have felt by these Changes, Will draw you home to Constancy, and the Wooll That has so violently been taken from Your Sheep, for want of an Indulgent Shepherd, [To the Archbishop. Make you prize one the better. Arc., Epe., Hip., Icet. May Heaven transform our shapes when our hearts change. Evan. Then are we strong enough to Combate Fate, And Cure the wounds thus made upon the State. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
