Abroad my pretty Bees: I hope youl find Neither rough tempest, nor commanding winde To check your flight, carry an humble wing, Buzze boldly what I bid, but doe not sting Your generous Patron: wheresoere you come Feede you on waxe, leave them the Honey-combe: Yet if you meet a tart Antagonist, (Or discontented rugged Satyrist) That sleights your Errant, or his Art that pend it, Cry, Tanti: Bid him kisse his Muse—and mend it: If then they Meawe, reply not you, but bring Their names to me, Ile send out Waspes shall sting Their Malice to the quick; If they cap words, Tell 'em your Master is a twisting cord's Shall make pride skip; if I must needs take paines, 'T shall be to draw blood from Detractions vaines, Tho shevelld like Parchment, Art can make em bleed, And what I vow, Apollo has decreed: Your whole commission in one line's enrowld, Be valiantlie free, but not too bold.

      <field name="fulltext">The Booke to the Reader. In my commission I am charg'd to greet And mildly kisse the hands of all I meet, Which I must doe, or never more be seene About the Fount of sacred Hippocreene. Smooth sockt Thalia takes delight to dance Ith' Schooles of Art, the doore of ignorance Shee sets a Crosse on; Detractors shee doth scorne, Yet kneeles to Censure, (so it be true borne) I had rather fall into a Beadles hands That reads, and with his reading understands; Then some Plush-Midas, that can read no further But Bees? whose penning? mew, this man doth murther A writers credit and wrong'd poesie (Like a rich Diamond dropt into the Sea) Is by him lost for ever, quite through read me, Or 'mongst wast paper into Pastboard knead me, Presse me to death, so tho your churlish hands Rob me of life, Ile save my paper lands For my next heire, who with Poetick breath May in sad Elegie record my death. If so: I wish my Epitaph may be Onely three words, Opinion murdered me. Liber Lectori Candido.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Character 1: Prorex, or the Master Bees Character. A Parliament is held, Bils and complaints Referd and heard, with severall restraints Of usurpt freedome, Instituted law, To keepe the common wealth of Bees in awe. Speakers. Prorex, Aulicus, Oeconomicus, Dicastes, Speaker: Prorex. To us, who warranted by Obrons love, Write our selfe Mr. Bee, both field and grove, Garden and Orchard, lawnes &amp; flowrie meades, Where th'amorous winde plaies with the golden heads Of wanton Cowslips, Dasies in their prime, Some loving Marigolds, the blossom'd Thyme, The blew-veind Violets, and the Damask rose, The statelie Lilly, mistris of all those, Are allowd and given by Obrons free areede, Pasture for me and all my swarmes to feed. Now that our will and soveraigne intent, May be made knowne, wee call this parliament, And as the wise determiner of power, Proportion, time to moments, minutes, houres, Weeks, months, years, ages, distinguish'd day from night Winter from Summer, profunditie from height In Sublunaries, as in the course of Heaven The bodies Metaphysicall runne even, Zeniths and Zones have their apt stations, Planets and Starres their Constellations, With Orbes to move in, so divinely made Some spherically move, some retrograde, Yet all keepe course; so shall it be our care That every Family have his proper Spheare. And to that purpose, Auticus be groome Of all our lodgings, and provide fit roome To lay in wax &amp; Honey, both for us And all our houshold: Oeconomicus, Be you our steward, carefully to fit Quotidian diet, and so order it, Each may have equall portion: And beside Needfull provision, carefully provide Store against warre and Famine: Martio thee I have found valiant, thy authority (Beeing approv'd for Discipline in armes) Shall be to muster up our warlike swarmes Of winged lances, for like a peacefull King, Although we were, we are loath to use our sting. Speaker, informe us what petitions Our Commons put up at these Sessions. A bill preferd against the Humble Bee. Speaker. A bill preferd, against a publique wrong: The surly Humble Bee, who hath too long Liv'd like an Out-law, and will neither pay Honey nor waxe, doe service, nor obey) But like a fellon coucht under a weed Watches advantage to make boot and feed Vpon the top-branch blossomes, and by stealth Makes dangerous inroads on your common-wealth, Robs the day-labourer of his golden prize And sends him weeping home, with emptie thighes. Thus like a theefe, he flies ore hill and downe And Out-law-like doth challenge as his owne Your Highnes due, nay Pyratick detaines The waxen fleet sailing upon your plaines. Prorex. A great abuse, which we must have redrest Before it growes to high: on too the rest. A bill preferd against the Waspe. Speaker. A bill preferd against the Waspe; a Flie Who Merchant-like under pretence to buy Makes bold to borrow, and paies too. Pro: But when? Speaker. Why ad Kalendas Græcas, never then. A bill against the Hornet. Theres the strange Hornet, who doth ever weare A scalie armor, and a double Speare, Coucht in his front, rifles the Merchants packs Upon the Rhode, your honey and your waxe He doth by stealth transport to some strange shoare, Makes rich their hives, and keeps your own groves poor. Prorex. I thanke your Industrie, but we'l devise A stature that no such Out-landish flies Shall carry such high wing: Speaker. Yet these alone A bill preferd against the Drone: Doe not afflict us, but the lazie droane Our native country Bee, who like the Snaile (That bankrowt-like makes his owne shell his jayle All the day long) Ith'evening plaies the thief, And when the labouring Bees have tane reliefe, Be gone to rest, against all right and lawe Acts burglary, breakes ope their house of straw, And not alone makes pillage of their hives; But (Butcher-like) bereaves them of their lives. Prorex. 'Gainst all these Out-lawes. Martio bee thou Lievetenant Generall, thou knowst well how To hamper such Delinquents. Dicastes thee We make our advocate, thy office be To moderate each difference and jar In this our civill Oeconomicke war, And let both plaintife, and defendant be Heard and dispatcht for conscionable fee And more to keepe our Anomoi in awe (sine leges viventes) Our selfe (the chiefe) will live under a law. Dicast. To each desert Ile render lawfull weight, The scale of justice shall use no deceipt: Prorex. It looses name and nature, if it shud, Next Villicus, thou that frequentst the wood Our painefull russet Bee, we create thee Chiefe baylife both of fallow-field and lee? Appoint each Bee his walke, the medow-bee Shall not encroach upon the upland lee, But keepe his bound, if any with intent To wrong our state flye from our government, Hoarding their hony up in rocks or trees, Sell or transport it to our enemies, Breake downe their Garners, seise upon their store, And in our name divide it 'mongst the poore, Onely to us reserve our royalties, High waies and wastes, all other specialties We make thee ruler of Vill: and Ile impart To all with a free hand and faithfull heart: Pro. Now break up Court, and each one to his toyle, Thrive by your labours, drones live a'the spoyle, Feare neither Waspe, nor Hornet, forreyners Be bard from being intercommoners, And having laboured hard from light to light, With golden thighes, come singing home at night, For neither Droane, Waspe, Fly nor Humble-Bee, Shall dare to rob you of your treasury. So to your Summer harvest, worke and thrive Bounti's the blessing of the labourers hive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eleemozynus. Character. 2. The Hospitable Bee. The Author in his Russet Bee, Characters Hospitalitie, Describes his hive; and for his feasts Appoints fit daies, and names his guests. Speakers. Eleemozynus. Cordato. Cordato: Your hiv's a rare one, Rome did never raise A work of greater wonder. Eleemozynus. Spare your praise, Tis finish'd, and the cost stands on no score, None can for want of payment, at my dore Curse my foundation; seeing the smoake goe Out of those lovers, for whose straw I owe. Cordato. Why to your hive have ye so many waies? Elemozynus. They answer just the number of seven dais, On Mondayes such, whose fortunes are sunck lowe, By good houskeeping, Ile my almes bestow. On Tewsdaies such as all their life-times wrought Their countries freedome, and her battailes fought; On Wedensdaies, such as with painfull wit Have div'd for knowledge in the sacred writ; On Thursdayes such as prov'd unfortunate In Counsell, and high offices of state; On Fridayes such as for their Conscience sake Are kept in bonds; on Saturdaies Ile make Feasts for poore Bees past labour, Orphane frie And widdowes ground in Mils of usury. And Sundayes for my Tenants and all Swaines That labour for me on the groves and plaines. The windowes of my hive, with blossomes dight Are Porters to let in (our comfort) light, In number just six hundred, sixtie five, 'Cause in so many daies the Sunne doth drive His Chariot (stucke with beames of burnish'd gold,) About the world by Sphericall Motion rowld, For my almes shall diurnall progresse make With the free sunne in his bright Zodiacke.

And you'l performe all this? Eleem. Faire &amp; upright As are the strict vowes of an Anchorite, An almes that by a Niggards hand is serv'd Is mold and gravelly bread, the hunger-sterv'd May take, but cannot eat: Ile deale none such Who with free hand shakes out but Crums, gives much. Cordato. You'l have bad helps in this good course of life, You might doe therefore well to take a wife. Eleemo. A wife? when I should have one hand in Heaven To write my happinesse (in leaves as even And smooth as Porphyry) shee'd by the other Plucke me quite downe, vertue scarce knowes a mother. Pardon sweet Females, I your Sex admire, But dare not sit too neare your wanton fire, Fearing your fairer beauties tempting flame My sound affections might put out of frame. In like manner said Alexander by the daughters of Drius. Nescio quid latentis veneni habet caro fœminea, Vt prudentiores citius corrumpat. Card. Who then shall reap the golden crop you sow? Tis halfe a curse t'have wealth, and not to knowe Whom to call heire. Eleemo: My heirs shall be the poor Bees wanting limbs, such as in daies of yore Pend learned Canzons, for no other meed, But that in them unletterd Bees might reade, And reading lay up knowledge, being alive Such Ile maintaine, and being dead my hive Honey and waxe I will bequeath to build A skep where weekely meetings may be held To read and heare such ancient morall sawes As may teach ignorance the use of lawes; And these will be a true Inheritance, Not to decay, neither sword, fire, nor chance, Thunder of Iove, nor mundane Casualties Can ruin the succession of these: Mannors, Parkes, Townes, nay Kingdomes may be sold, But still the poore stand like a Lords free-hold Vnforfeited; of all lawe-tricks not one Can throw the poor out of possession: Should I loose all my hives and waxen wealth, Out of the poore mans dish I should drink health, Comfort and blessings, therefore keepe aloofe And tempt no further, whilst I live my Roofe Shall cover naked wretches, when I dye Ile dedicate it to Saint Charity.</field>

Labours and toyles, Extracts more honey out of barren soyles Then twenty lazie droans, I have heard my father Steward of the hive professe, that he had rather Loose halfe the swarme then him; If a bee poor or weak Grow faint on's way, or by mis-fortune break A wing or leg against a twig; alive Or dead, hee'l bring into the Mrs. Hive Him and his burthen; but the other day On the next plaine, there grew a mortall fray Betwixt the waspes and us, the wind grew high, And a rough storme rag'd so impetuously, Our bees could scarce keep wing, then fel such raine, It made our Colonie forsake the plaine, And fly to garrison, yet still he stood And 'gainst the whole swarme made his party good, And at each blow he gave, cryed out his vow, His vow and Arethusa, on each bough And tender blossome he ingraves her name, With his sharpe sting, to Arethusaes fame He consecrates his actions, all his worth Is only spent to character her forth.

These shall be all chiefe mourners, and because This sigh kild Arethusa, here weel pawse And drop a teare, the tribute of her love, Next this because a sigh did kill my Dove (A good conceit, I pray forget it not) At the foure corners of this Chariot Ile have the foure windes statued, which shall blow And sigh my sorrowes out, above, below, Into each quarter, then Sir, on the top Over all these gawdy trim things, Ile set up My Statue in jet, my posture this Catching at Arethusa; my lost blisse: For over me by Geometrick pins Ile have her hang betwixt two Cherubins, As if they had snatcht her up from me and earth (In Heaven to give her a more glorious birth) The word this what should vertue doe on earth? This Ile have done, and when tis finish'd: All That love come to my poor sighs funerall. Swell gall, break heart, flow tears like a full tyde, For with a sigh faire Arethusa dy'd. Areth. Rather then thus, your youthfull flames should smother, Forget her thought and entertaine another. Char. Oh never never with the Turtle dove A sigh shall beare my soule up to my love.</field>

Phar. How, ever sound? were all our Gallants so, Doctors and Pothecaries might go sow Dowlasse for saffron-bags, take leave of silk, And eat greene chibbals, and sowre butter-milk, Would you know how all physick to confound? Why 'tis done thus, keep but your Gallants sound. Sen. 'Tis their owne faults, if they 'fore springs or fals, Emptying wine-glasses fill up urinals. Man was made sound at first; if he growes ill, 'Tis not by course of Nature, but free will: Distempers are not ours; there should be then, Were we our selves, no physick, men to men Are both diseases cause, and the disease.

No, you are too hard bound, And you must cast me up the fiftie pound I gave you in bribe-powder. St. Be patient. Phar. Youle practise on me then. Sen. If this be true, My health I see is bought and sold by you: A Doctor buys me next, whose Messe of potions, Striking me full of ulcers; oyles and lotions Bequeath me to a Surgeon; last of all He gives me dyet in an Hospitall. Then comes the Scrivener, and he draws my wil, Thus slaves for gold their Mrs. sell and kill, Nay nay, so got so keepe it, for thy fifty Take here a hundred, wee'l not now be thriftie, But of such artles Empiricks Ile beware, And learne both when to spend &amp;, when to spare.</field>

Royall Sir, My care made me a loyterer, To bring in these transgressing Bees, Who by deceits and fallacies Cloath'd with a smooth and faire intent, Have wrong'd me in my government. Obr. The manner how? Pro. These wicked three, The Wasp, the Droane, and Humble Bee, Conspir'd like Traytors, first the Wasp, Sought in his covetous paw to grasp All he could finger, made the Sea Not onely his monopolie; But with his wing'd swarmes scowr'd the plaines, Robbed and slew our wearie Swaines Comming from work: The Humble Bee (A flye as tyrannous as hee) By a strange yet legall stealth, Non-suited Bees of all their wealth. The Drone, a Bee more mercilesse, Our needy commons so oppresse, By hoording up, and poysoning th'earth, Once in three yeares hee'd make a dearth, A needlesse one, transporting more To strangers than would feed our poore, At quarter day, if any lacks His rent, he ceaze both honey and wax, Throwing him out to beg and sterve For which.

Sojourn'd amongst you, when you spent Whole yeares in ryotous merriment, Thrusting poore Bees out of their hives, Ceazing both honey, wax, and lives, You should have call'd for mercie, when You impal'd common blossomes, when In stead of giving poore Bees food, You eat their flesh and drunk their blood. All. Be this our warning. Obr. 'Tis too late, Fairies thrust them to their fate: Now Prorex our chiefe Mr. Bee, And Vice-Roy, thus we lesson thee, Thy preterit errours we forgive, Provided you hereafter live In compasse, take againe your Crowne, But make your subjects so your owne, As you for them may answer. Pro. Sir, (For this high favour you confer) True loyaltie (upon my knee) I promise both for them and mee. Obr. Rise in our love then, and that you, What you have promis'd may pursue, Chaste Latria I bestow On you in Marriage, sheele teach you how To be your selfe; faire truth and time, Boulwarch, and constant Chime, To all your actions: Now adew, Prorex shall againe renew His potent raigne: the massie world Which in Glittering Orbes is hurld About the poles, be Lord of: wee Onely reserve our Royaltie, Field-musicke? Obron must away For us our Gentle Fayries stay, In the Mountaines and the rocks Wee'l hunt the Gray, and little Foxe, Who destroy our Lambs at feed, And spoyle the Neasts, where Turtles breed, If Vespa, Fucus, or proud Error Fright thy Bees, and be a terror To thy Groves, 'tis Obrons will As Out-lawes you them seize and kill, Apollo, and the Muses dance; Art has banish'd ignorance, And chas'd all flies of Rape and stealth From forth our winged Common-wealth.
