      <field name="fulltext">THE DESCRIPTION OF THE Scæne. The first thing that presented it selfe to the sight, was a rich Ornament, that enclosed the Scæne; in the upper part of which, were great branches of Foliage growing out of leaves and huskes, with a Coronice at the top; and in the midst was placed a large Compartiment composed of Groteske worke, wherein were Harpies with wings and Lyons clawes, and their hinder parts converted into leaves and branches: over all was a broken Frontispice, wrought with scrowles and masque heads of Children; and within this a Table adorn'd with a lesser Compartiment, with this Inscription, COELVM BRITANNICVM. The two sides of this Ornament were thus ordered: First, from the ground arose a square Basement, and on the Plinth stood a great vaze of gold, richly enchased, and beautified with Sculptures of great Releine, with frutages hanging from the upper-part: At the foot of this sate two youths naked, in their naturall colours; each of these with one arme supported the Vaze; on the cover of which stood two young women in Draperies, arme in arme; the one figuring the glory of Princes, and the other Mansuetude: their other armes bore up an Ovall, in which, to the Kings Majesty was this Imprese, A Lyon with an Imperiall Crowne on his head; the word, Animum sub pectore forti: On the other side was the like Composition, but the designe of the Figures varied; and in the Oval on the top, being borne up by Nobility. and Fecundity, was this Imprese to the Queens Majesty, A Lilly growing with branches and leaves, and three lesser Lillies springing out of the Stemme; the Word, Semper inclita Virtus: All this Ornament was heightned with Gold, and for the Invention, and various composition was the newest and most gracious that hath beene done in this place. The Curtaine was watchet, and a pale yellow in paines, which flying up on the sudden, discovered the Scæne, representing old Arches, old Palaces, decayed wals, parts of Temples, Theaters, Basilita's and Therme, with confused heaps of broken Columnes, Bases, Coronices and Statues, lying as under-ground, and altogether resembling the ruines of some great Citie of the ancient Romans, or civiliz'd Brittaines. This strange prospect detayn'd the eyes of the Spectators sometime, when to a loud Musick Mercury descends; on the upper part of his Chariot stands a Cocke in action of crowing: his habit was a Coat of flame colour girt to him, and a white Mantle trimm'd with gold and silver; upon his head a wreath with small fals of white Feathers, a Caduseus in his hand, and wings at his heeles: being come to the ground he dismounts, and goes up to the State. Mercury. From the high Senate of the gods, to You Bright glorious Twins of Love and Majesty, Before whose Throne three warlike Nations bend Their willing knees, on whose Imperiall browes. The Regall Circle prints no awfull frownes To fright your Subjects, but whose calmer eyes Shed joy and safety on their melting hearts That flow with cheerefull loyall reverence, Come my Cyllenius, Ioves Ambassadour: Not, as of gold, to whisper amorous tales Of wanton love, into the glowing eare Of some choyce beauty in this numerous traine: Those dayes are fled, the rebell flame is quench'd In heavenly brests, the gods have sworne by Styx, Never to tempt yeelding mortality To loose embraces. Your exemplar life Hath not alone transfus'd a zealous heat Of imitation through your vertuous Court, By whose bright blaze your Pallace is become The envy'd patterne of this under-world, But the aspiring flame hath kindled heaven; Th'immortall bosomes burne with emulous fires, Iove rivals your great vertues, Royall Sir, And Iuno, Madam, your attractive graces, He his wild lusts, her raging jealousies She layes aside, and through th'Olympique hall, As yours doth here, their great Example spreads, And though of old, when youthfull blood conspir'd With his new Empire, prone to heats of lust, He acted incests, rapes, adulteries On earthly beauties, which his raging Queene, Swolne with revengefull fury, turn'd to beasts, And in despight he transform'd to Stars, Till he had fill'd the crowded Firmament With his loose Strumpets, and their spurious race, Where the eternall records of his shame Shine to the world in flaming Characters; When in the Chrystall myrrour of your reigne He view'd himselfe, he found his loathsome staines; And now, to expiate the infectious guilt Of those detested luxuries, hee'll chace Th'infamous lights from their usurped Sheare, And drowne in the Lethæan flood, their curs'd Both names and memories. In whose vacant rooms First you succeed, and of the wheeling Orbe In the most eminent and conspicuous point, With dazeling beames, and spreading magnitude, Shine the bright Pole-starre of this Hemispheare, Next, by your side, in a triumphant Chaire, And crown'd with Ariadnes Diadem, Sits the faire Consort of your heart, and Throne; Diffus'd about you, with that share of light As they of vertue have deriv'd from you, Hee'll fix this Noble traine, of either sexe; So to the Brittish stars this lower Globe Shall owe its light, and they alone dispence To'th world a pure refined influence. Enter Momus attired in a long darkish Robe, all wrought over with ponyards, Serpents tongues, eyes and eares, his beard and haire party coloured, and upon his head a wreath stucke with Feathers, and a Porcupine in the forepart. Momus. By your leave, Mortals. Gooden Cozen Hermes, your pardon good my Lord Ambassadour: I found the tables of your Armes and Titles, in every Inne betwixt this and Olympus, where your present expedition is registred, your nine thousandth nine hundred ninety ninth Legation. I cannot reach the policy why your Master breeds so few States-men, it suits not with his dignity that in the whole Empyræum there should not bee a god fit to send on these honourable errands but your selfe, who are not yet so carefull of his honour as your owne, as might become your quality, when you are itinerant: the Hosts upon the high-way cry out with open-mouth upon you for supporting pilfery in your traine; which, though as you are the god of petty Larcinry, you might protect, yet you know it is directly against the new orders, and opposes the Reformation in Diameter. Merc. Peace Rayler, bridle your licentious tongue. And let this Presence teach you modesty. Mom. Let it if it can; in the meane time I will acquaint it with my condition. Know, (gay people) that though your Poets who enjoy by Patent a particular privilege to draw down any of the Deities from Twelf-night till Shrove-tuesday, at what time there is annually a most familiar enter-course betweene the two Courts, have as yet never invited me to these Solemnities, yet it shall appeare by my intrusion this night, that I am a very considerable Person upon these occasions, and may most properly assist at such entertainements. My name is Momus-ap-Somnus-ap-Erebus-æp-Chaos-ap-Demorgorgon-ap-Eternity. My Offices and Titles are, The Supreme Theomastix, Hupercrittique of manners, Protonotarie of abuses, Arch-Informer, Dilator Generall, Vniversall Calumniator, Eternall Plaintiffe, and perpetuall Foreman of the Grand Inquest. My privileges are an ubiquitary, circumambulatory, speculatory, interrogatory, redargutory immunity over all the privy lodgings, behind hangings, doores, curtaines, through key-holes, chinkes, windowes, about all Veneriall Lobbies, Skonces or Redoubts, though it be to the surprize of a perdu Page or Chambermaid, in, and at all Courts of civill and criminall judicature, all Counsels, Consultations, and Parlamentary Assemblies, where though I am but a Woolsacke god, and have no vote in the sanction of new lawes, I have yet a Prærogative of wresting the old to any whatsoever interpretation, whether it be to the behoofe, or prejudice, of Iupiter his Crowne and Dignity, for, or against the Rights of either house of Patrician or Plebeian gods. My naturall qualities are to make Iove frowne, Iuno powt, Mars chafe, Venus blush, Vulcan glow, Saturne quake; Cynthia pale, Phæbus hide his face, and Mercury here take his heeles. My recreations are witty mischiefes, as when Saturne guelt his father; the Smith caught his wife and her Bravo in a net of Cobweb-Iron; and Hebe, through the lubricity of the pavement tumbling over the Halfpace, presented the Embleme of the forked tree. and discover'd to the tann'd Ethiops the snowie cliffs of Culabria with the Grotta of Puteolum. But that you may arrive at the perfect knowledge of me, by the familiar illustration of a Bird of mine owne feather, old Peter Aretine, who reduc'd all the Scepters and Myters of that Age tributary to his wit, was my Parallell; and Frank Rublais suck'd much of my milke too; but your moderne French Hospitall of Oratory, is meere counterfeit, an arrant Mountebanke, for though fearing no other fortunes than his Sciatica, hee discourse of Kings and Queenes with as little Reverence as of Groomes and Chamber-maids, yet he wants their fangteeth, and Scorpions tayle; I meane that fellow, who to adde to his stature thinks it a greater grace to dance on his tiptoes like a Dog in a doublet, than to walke like other men on the soles of his feet. Merc. No more impertinent Trifeler, you disturbe The great Affaire with your rude scurrilous chat: What doth the knowledge of your abject state Concerne Ioves solemne Message? Mom. Sir, by your favour, though you have a more especiall Commission of employment from Iupiter, and a larger entertainment from his Exchequer, yet as a freeborne god I have the liberty to travell at mine owne charges without your passe or countenance Legacine; and that it may appeare a sedulous acute of observer, may know as much as a dull flegmatique Ambassadour, and weares a treble key to unlocke the mysterious Cyphers of your darke secrecies, I will discourse the politique state of Heaven to this trimme Audience.— At this the Scæna changeth, and in the heaven is discovered a Spheare, with Stars placed in their severall Images; borne up by a huge naked Figure (onely a peece of Drapery hanging over his thigh) kneeling and bowing forwards, as if the great weight lying on his shoulders opprest him, upon his head a Crowne, by all which hee might easily bee knowne to be Atlas. —You shall understand, that Iupiter upon the inspection of I know not what vertuous Presidents extant (as they say) here in this Court, but as I more probably ghesse out of the consideration of the decay of his naturall abilities, hath before a frequent convocation of the Superlunary Peeres in a solemne Oration recanted, disclaymed, and utterly renounced all the lascivious extravagancies, and riotous enormities of his forepast licentious life, and taken his oath on Iunos Breviary, religiously kissing the two-leav'd Booke, never to stretch his limbs more betwixt adulterous sheets, and hath with patheticall remonstrances exhorted, and under strict penalties enjoyned a respective conformity in the severall subordinate Deities; and because the Libertines of Antiquity, the Ribald Poets, to perpetuate the memory and example of their tryumphs over chastity, to all future imitation, have in their immortall songs celebrated the martyrdome of those Strumpets under the persecution of the wives, and devolved to Posterity the Pedigrees of their whores bawds, and bastards; it is therfore by the authority aforesaid enacted, that this whole Army of Constellations be immediately disbanded and casheerd, so to remove all imputation of impiety from the Cœlestiall Spirits, and all lustfull influences upon terrestriall bodies; and consequently that there be an Inquisition erected to exspunge in the Ancient, and suppresse in the moderne and succeeding Poems and Pamphlets, all past, present, and future mention of those abjur'd heresies, and to take particular notice of all ensuing incontinences, and punish them in their high Commission Court. Am not I in election to be a tal Statesman think you, that can repeat a passage at a Counsell-table thus punctually? Merc. I shun in vaine the importunity With which this Snarler vexeth all the gods, Iove cannot scape him: well, what else from heaven? Mom. Heaven! Heaven is no more the place it was; a Cloyster of Carthusians, a Monastery of converted gods, Iove is growne old and fearefull, apprehends a subversion of his Empire, and doubts lest Fate should introduce a legall succession in the legetimate heire, by repossessing the Titanian line, and hence springs all this innovation. We have had new orders read in the Presence Chamber, by the Vi-President of Parnassus, too strict to be observed long, Monopolies are called in, sophistication of wares punished, and rates imposed on commodities. Injunctions are gone out to the Nectar Brewers, for the purging of the heavenly Beverage of a narcotique weed which hath rendred the Idæaes confus'd in the Divine intellects, and reducing it to the composition used in Saturnes Reigne. Edicts are made for the restoring of decayed house-keeping, prohibiting the repayre of Families to the Metropolis, but this did endanger an Amazonian mutiny, till the females put on a more masculine resolution of solliciting businesses in their owne persons, and leaving their husbands at home for stallions of hospitality. Bacchus hath commanded all Tavernes to be shut, and no liquor drawne after tenne at night. Cupid must goe no more so scandalously naked, but is enjoyned to make him breeches, though of his mothers petticotes. Ganimede is forbidden the Bedchamber, and must only minister in publique. The gods must keepe no Pages, nor Groomes of their Chamber under the age of 25. and those provided of a competent stocke of beard. Pan may not pipe, nor Proteus juggle, but by especiall permission. Vulcan was brought to an Oretenus and fined, for driving in a plate of Iron into one of the Sunnes Chariot-wheeles, and frost-nailing his horses upon the fifth of November last, for breach of a penall Statute prohibiting worke upon Holi-dayes, that being the annuall celebration of the Gygantomachy. In briefe, the whole state of the Hierarchy suffers a totall reformation, especially in the poynt of reciprocation of conjugall affection. Venus hath confest all her adulteries, and is receiv'd to grace by her husband, who conscious of the great disparity betwixt her perfections and his deformities, allowes those levities as an equall counterpoize; but it is the prettiest spectacle to see her stroaking with her Ivory hand his collied cheeks, and with her snowie fingers combing his sooty beard. Iupiter too beginnes to learne to lead his owne wife, I left him practising in the milky way; and there is no doubt of an universall obedience, where the Lawgiver himselfe in his owne person observes his degrees so punctually; who besides to eternize the memory of that great example of Matrimoniall union which he derives from hence, hath on his Bed-chamber door, and feeling, fretted with starres in capitall Letters, engraven the Inscription of CARLOMARIA. This is as much I am sure as either your knowledge or Instructions can direct you to, which I having in a blunt round tale, without State-formality, politique inferences, or suspected Rhetoricall elegancies, already delivered, you may now dexteriously proceed to the second part of your charge, which is the raking of yonr heavenly sparks up in the Embers, or reducing the Etheriall lights to their primitive opacity, and grosse darke subsistance; they are all unrivited from the Spheare, and hang loose in their sockets, where they but attend the waving of your Caduce, and immediately they reinvest their pristine shapes, and appeare before you in their owne naturall deformities. Merc. Momus thou shalt prevaile, for since thy bold Intrusion hath inverted my resolves, I must obey necessity, and thus turne My face, to breath the Thunders just decree 'Gainst this adulterate spheare, which first I purge Of loathsome Monsters, and mis-shapen formes: Downe from her azure concave, thus I charme The Lyrnean Hydra, the rough unlick'd Beare, The watchfull Dragon, the storme-boading Whale, The Centaure, the horn'd Goatfish Capricorne, The Snake-head Gorgon, and fierce Sagittar: Divested of your gorgeous starry robes, Fall from the circling Orbe, and e're you sucke Fresh venome in, measure this happy earth, Then to the Fens, Caves, Forrests, Desarts, Seas, Fly, and resume your native qualities. They dance in those menstrous shapes the first Antimaske of naturall deformity. Mom. Are not these fine companions, trim play fellowes for the Deities? yet these and their fellowes have made up all our conversation for some thousands of yeares. Doe not you faire Ladies acknowledge your selves deeply engaged now to those Poets your servants, that in the height of commendation have rais'd your beauties to a parallel with such exact proportions, or at least rank'd you in their spruce society. Hath not the consideration of these Inhabitants rather frighted your thoughts utterly from the contemplation of the place? but now that these heavenly Mansions are to be voyd, you that shall hereafter be found unlodged will become inexcusable; especially since Vertue alone shall be sufficient title, fine, and rent: yet if there be a Lady not competently stock'd that way, shee shall not on the instant utterly despaire, if shee carry a sufficient pawn of handsomenesse; for however the letter of the Law runs, Iupiter notwithstanding his Age and present austerity, will never refuse to stamp beauty, and make it currant with his owne Impression; but to such as are destitute of both, I can afford but small encouragement. Proceed Cozen Mercury, what followes? Merc. Look up, and marke where the bright Zodiack Hangs like a Belt about the brest of heaven; On the right shoulder, like a flaming Iewell, His shell, with nine rich Topazes adorn'd, Lord of this Tropique, sits the skalding Crab; He, when the Sunne gallops in full careere His annuall race; his gastly clawes uprear'd, Frights at the confines of the torrid Zone, The fiery teame, and proudly stops their course, Making a solstice, till the fierce Steeds learne His backward paces, and so retrograde Poste downe-hill to th'opposed Capricorne. Thus I depose him from his laughty Throne; Drop from the Sky, into the briny flood, There teach thy motion to the ebbing Sea, But let those fires that beautifi'd thy shell Take humane shapes, and the disorder shew Of thy regressive paces here below. The second Antimasque is danc'd in retrograde paces, expressing obliquity in motion. Mom. This Crab, I confesse, did ill become the heavens; but there is another that more infests the Earth, and makes such a solstice in the politer Arts and Sciences, as they have not beene observed for many Ages to have made any sensible advance: could you but lead the learned squadrons with a masculine resolution past this point of retrogradation, it were a benefit to mankind, worthy the power of a god, and to be payed with Altars; but that not being the worke of this night, you may pursue your purposes: what now succeeds? Merc. Vice, that unbodied, in the Appetite Erects his Throne, hath yet, in bestiall shapes, Branded, by Nature, with the Character And distinct stampe of some peculiar Ill, Mounted the Sky, and fiz'd his Trophies there: As fawning flattery in the little Dog; I'th bigger, churlish Murmur; Cowardize I'th timorous Hare; Ambition in the Eagle; Rapine and Avarice in th'adventurous Ship That sayl'd to Colchos for the golden fleece; Drunken distemper in the Goblet flowes; I'th Dart and Scorpion, biting Calumny; In Hercules and the Lyon, furious rage; Vaine Ostentation in Cassiope; All these I to eternall exile doome, But to this place their Emblem'd Vices summon, Clad in those proper Figures, by which best Their incorporeall nature is exprest. The third Antimasque is danc'd of these severall vices, expressing the deviation from Vertue. Mom. From hence forth it shall be no more said in the Proverbe, when you would expresse a riotous Assembly, That hell, but Heaven is broke loose: this was an arrant Goale-delivery, all the Prisons of your great Cities could not have vomited more corrupt matter: but Cozen Cylleneus, in my judgement it is not safe that these infectious persons should wander here to the hazard of this Iland, they threatned lesse danger when they were nayl'd to the Firmament: I should conceive it a very discreet course, since they are provided of a tall vessell of their owne ready rigg'd, to embarque them all together in that good Ship called the Argo, and send them to the plantation in New-England, which hath purg'd more virulent humours from the politique body, then Guacum and all the West-Indian drugs have from the naturall bodies of this Kingdome: Can you devise how to dispose them better? Merc. They cannot breath this pure and temperate Ayre Where Vertue lives, but will with hasty flight, Mongst fogs and vapours, seeke unsound abodes, Fly after them, from your usurped seats, You foule remainders of that viporous brood: Let not a Starre of luxurious race With his loose blaze staine the skyes chrystall face. All the Starres are quenchd, and the Spheare darkened. Before the entry of every Antimasque, the Starres in those figures in the Spheare which they were to represent, were extinct; so as, by the end of the Antimasques in the Spheare no more Stars were seene. Mom. Here is a totall Ecclipse of the eighth Spheare, which neither Booker, Allestre, nor any of your Prognosticators, no nor their great Master Tico were aware of; but yet in my opinion there were some innocent, and some generous Constellations, that might have beene reserved for Noble uses: as the Skales and Sword to adorne the statue of Iustice, since she resides here on Earth onely in Picture and Effigie. The Eagle had beene a fit present for the Germans, in regard their Bird hath mew'd most of her feathers lately. The Dolphin too had beene most welcome to the French, and then had you but clapt Perseus on his Pegasus, brandishing his Sword, the Dragon yawning on his backe under the horses feet, with Python's dart through his throat, there had beene a Divine St. George for this Nation: but since you have improvidently shuffled them altogether, it now rests onely that wee provide an immediate succession, and to that purpose I will instantly proclaime a free Election. O yes, O yes, O yes, By the Father of the gods, and the King of men. Whereas wee having observed a very commendable practise taken into frequent use by the Princes of these latter Ages, of perpetuating the memory of their famous enterprizes, sieges, battels, victories, in Picture, Sculpture, Tapistry, Embroyderies, and other manifactures, wherewith they have embellished their publicke Palaces, and taken into Our more distinct and serious consideration, the particular Christmas, hanging of the Guard-Chamber of this Court, wherein the Navall Victory of 88. is to the eternall glory of this Nation exactly delineated; and whereas We likewise out of a propheticall imitation of this so laudable custome, did for many thousand yeares before, adorne and beautifie the eighth roome of Our cælestiall Mansion, commonly called the Starre-Chamber, with the military adventures, stratagems, atchievements, feats and defeats, performed in Our Owne person, whilst yet Our Standard was erected, and Wee a Combattant in the Amorous Warfare. It hath notwithstanding, after mature deliberation, and long debate, held first in our owne inscrutable bosome, and afterwards communicated with Our Privy Councell, seemed meet to Our Omnipotency, for causes to Our selfe best knowne, to unfurnish and dis-array. Our fore-said Starre-Chamber of all those Ancient Constellations which have for so many Ages been sufficiently notorious, and to admit into their vacant places, such Persons onely as shall be qualified with exemplar Vertue and eminent Desert, there to shine in delible Characters of glory to all Posterity, It is therefore Out divine will and pleasure, voluntarily, and out of Our owne free and proper motion, meere grace and speciall favour, by these presents to specifie and declare to all Our loving People, that it shall be lawfull for any Person whatsoever, that conceiveth him or her selfe to bee really endued with any Heroicall Vertue or transcendent Merit, worthy so high a calling and dignity, to bring their severall pleas and pretences before Our Right trusty and and Welbeloved Cozen, and Councellor, Don Mercury, and god Momus, &amp;c. Our peculiar Deligates for that affaire, upon whom We have transferr'd an absolute power to conclude, and determine without Appeale or Revocation, accordingly as to their wisedomes it shall in such cases appeare behovefull and expedient. Given at Our Palace in Olympus the first day of the first moneth, in the first yeare of the Reformation. Plutus enters, an old man full of wrinkles, a bald head, a thin white beard, spectacles on his nose, with a buncht backe, and attir'd in a Robe of Cloath of gold. Plutus appeares. Merc. Who's this appeares? Mom. This is a subterravean Fiend, Plutus in this Dialect term'd Riches, or the god of Gold; a Poyson hid by Providence in the botome of Seas, and Navill of the Earth, from mans discovery, where if the seeds begunne to sprout above-ground, the excrescence was carefully guarded by Dragons; yet at last by humane curiosity brought to light, to their owne destruction; this being the true Pandora's box, whence issued all those mischiefes that now fill the Vniverse. Plut. That I prevent the message the of gods Thus with my haste, and not attend their summons; Which ought in Iustice call me to the place I now require of Right, is not alone To shew the just precedence that I hold Before all earthly, next th'immortall Powers; But to exclude the hope of partiall Grace In all Pretenders, who, since I descend To equall tryall, must by my example, Waving your favour, clayme by sole Desert. If Vertue must inherit, shee's my slave; I lead her captive in a golden chayne, About the world: Shee takes her Forme and Being From my creation; and those barren seeds That drop from Heaven, if I not cherish them With my distilling dewes, and fotive heat, They know no vegetation; but expos'd To blasting winds of freezing Poverty, Or not shoot forth at all, or budding, wither: Should I proclaime the daily sacrifice Brought to my Temples by the toyling rout, Not of the fat and gore of abject Beasts, But humane sweat, and blood powr'd on my Altars, I might provoke the envy of the gods. Turne but your eyes and marke the busie world, Climbing steepe Mountaines for the sparkling stone, Piercing the Center for the shining Ore, And th'Oceans bosome to rake pearly sands, Crossing the torrid and the frozen Zones, Midst Rocks and swallowing Gulfes, for gainful trade, And through opposing swords, fire, murdering Canon' Skaling the walled Townes for precious spoyles. Plant in the passage to your heavenly seats, These horrid dangers, and then see who dares Advance his desperate foot; yet am I sought, And oft in vaine, through these, and greater hazards; I could discover how your Deities Are for my sake sleighted, despis'd, abus'd, Your Temples, Shrines, Altars, and Images Vncover'd, rifled, robb'd, and disarray'd By sacrilegious hands: yet is this treasure To th'golden Mountaine, where I sit ador'd With superstitious solemne rights convay'd, And becomes sacred there, the sordid wretch Nor daring touch the consecrated Ore, Or with prophane hands lessen the bright heape; But this might draw your anger downe on mortals For rendring me the homage due to you: Yet what is said may well expresse my power Too great for Earth, and only fit for Heaven. Now, for your pastime, view the naked root, Which in the dirty earth, and base mould drown'd. Sends forth this precious Plant, and golden fruit. You lusty Swaines, that to your grazing flocks Pipe amorous Roundelayes; you toyling Hinds, That barbe the fields, and to your merry Teames Whistle your passions; and you mining Moles, That in the bowels of your mother-Earth Dwell the eternall burthen of her wombe, Cease from your labours, when Wealth bids you play, Sing, dance, and keepe a cheerefull holy-day. They dance the fourth Antimasque, consisting of Countrey people, musicke and measures. Merc. Plutus, the gods know and confesse your power, Which feeble Vertue seldome can resist; Stronger then Towers of brasse, or Chastity; Iove knew you when he courted Danæ, And Cupid weares you on that Arrowes head That still prevailes, But the gods keepe their Throne. To enstall Vertue, not her Enemies, They dread thy force, which even themselves have felt, Witnesse Mount-Ida, where the Martiall Maid, And frowning Iuno, did to mortall eyes Naked, for gold, their sacred bodies show, Therefore for ever be from heaven banish'd. But since with toyle from undiscover'd Worlds Thou art brought hither, where thou first didst breath The thirst of Empire, into Regall brests, And frightedst quiet Peace from her meek Throne, Filling the World with tumult, blood, and warre, Follow the Camps of the contentious earth, And be the Conqu'rers slave, but he that can Or conquer thee, or give thee Vertuous stampe, Shall shine in heaven a pure immortall Lampe. Mom. Nay stay, and take my benediction along with you. I could, being here a Co-Iudge, like others in my place, now that you are condemn'd, either rayle at you, or breake jests upon you, but I rather chuse to loose a word of good counsell, and entreat you to bee more carefull in your choyse of company, for you are alwayes found either with Misers, that not use you at all; or with fooles, that know not how to use you well: Be not hereafter so reserv'd and coy to men of worth and parts, and so you shall gaine such credit, as at the next Sessions you may bee heard with better successe. But till you are thus reform'd, I pronounce this positive sentence, That wheresoever you shall chuse to abide, your society shall adde no credit or reputation to the party, nor your discontinuance, or totall absence, be matter of disparagement to any man; and whosoever shall hold a contrary estimation of you, shall be condem'd to weare perpetuall Motley, unlesse he recant his opinion. Now you may voyd the Court. Pænia enters, a woman of a pale colour, large brims of a hat upon her head, through which her haire started up like a fury, her Robe was of a darke colour full of patches, about one of her hands was tide a chaine of Iron, to which was fastned a weighty stone, which shee bore up under her arme. Pænia enters. Merc. What Creature's this? Mom. The Antipodes to the other, they move like Two Buckets, or as two nayles drive out one another; If Riches depart, Poverty will enter. Pov. I nothing doubt (Great and Immortal Powers) But that the place, your wisedome hath deny'd My foe, your Iustice will conferre on me; Since that which renders him incapable, Proves a strong plea for me. I could pretend, Even in these rags, a larger Soveraignty Then gaudy Wealth in all his pompe can boast; For marke how few they are that share the World; The numerous Armies, and the swarming Ants That fight and toyle for them, are all my Subjects. They take my wages, weare my Livery: Invention too and Wit, are both my creatures, And the whole race of Vertue is my Off-spring; As many mischiefes issue from my wombe, And those as mighty, as proceed from gold. Oft o're his Throne I wave my awfull Scepter, And in the bowels of his state command, When 'midst his heapes of coyne, and hils of gold, I pine, and starve the avaritious Foole. But I decline those titles, and lay clayme To heaven, by right of Divine contemplation; She is my Darling, I, in my soft lap, Free from disturbing cares, bargaines, accounts, Leases, Rents, Stewards, and the feare of theeves, That vex the rich, nurse her in calme repose, And with her, all the Vertues speculative, Which, but with me, find no secure retreat. For entertainment of this houre, Ile call A race of people to this place, that live At Natures charge, and not importune heaven To chayne the winds up, or keepe back the stormes, To stay the thunder, or forbid the hayle To thresh the unreap'd eare; but to all weathers, Both chilling frost, and scalding Sunne, expose Their equall face. Come forth, my swarthy traine, In this faire circle dance, and as you move. Marke, and foretell happy events of Love. They dance the fifth Antimasque of Gypsies. Mom. I cannot but wonder that your perpetuall conversation with Poets and Philosophers hath furnished you with no more Logick, or that you should thinke to impose upon us so grosse an inference, as because Plutus and you are contrary, therefore whatsoever is denyed of the one, must bee true of the other; as if it should follow of necessity, because hee is not Iupiter, you are. No, I give you to know, I am better vers'd in cavils with the gods, then to swallow such a fallacie, for though you two cannot be together in one place, yet there are many places that may be without you both, and such is heaven, where neither of you are likely to arrive: therefore let me advise you to marry your selfe to Content, and beget sage Apothegmes, and goodly morall Sentences in disprayse of Riches, and contempt of the world. Merc. Thou dost presume too much, poore needy wretch, To claime a station in the Firmament, Because thy humble Cottage, or thy Tub Nurses some lazie or Pedantique vertue In the cheape Sun-shine, or by shady springs With roots and pot-hearbs; where thy right hand, Tearing those humane passions from the mind, Vpon whose stocks saire blooming vertues flourish, Degradeth Nature, and benummeth sense, And Gorgon-like, turnes active men to stone. Wee not require the dull society Of your necessitated Temperance, Or that unnaturall stupidity That knowes nor joy nor sorrow; nor your forc'd Falsly exalted passive Fortitude Above the active: This low abject brood, That fix their seats in mediocrity, Become your servile minds; but we advance Such vertues only as admit excesse, Brave bounteous Acts, Regall Magnificence, All-seeing Prudence, Magnanimity That knowes no bound, and that Heroick vertue For which Antiquity hath left no name, But patternes only, such as Hercules, Achilles, Theseus. Backe to thy loath'd cell, And when thou seest the new enlightned Spheare, Study to know but what those Worthies were. Tishe, enters, her head bald behind, and one great locke before, wings at her shoulders, and in her hand a wheele, her upper parts naked, and the skirt of her Garment wrought all over with Crownes, Scepters, Bookes, and such other things as expresse both her greatest and and smallest gifts. Mom. See where Dame Fortune comes, you may know her by her wheele, and that vayle over her eys, with which she hopes like a seel'd Pigeon to mount above the Clouds, and pearch in the eighth Spheare: listen, she begins. Fort. I come not here (you gods) to plead the Right, By which Antiquity assign'd my Deitie, Though no peculiar station 'mongst the Stars, Yet generall power to rule their influence, Or boast the Title of Omnipotent, Ascrib'd me then, by which I rival'd Iove, Since you have cancell'd all those old records: But confident in my good cause and merit, Claime a succession in the vacant Orbe, For since Astræa fled to heaven, I sit Her Deputy on Earth, I hold her skales And weigh mens Fates out, who have made me blind, Because themselves want eyes to see my causes, Call me inconstant, 'cause my workes surpasse The shallow fathom of their human reason; Yet here, like blinded Iustice, I dispence With my impartiall hands, their constant lots, And if desertlesse, impious men engrosse My best rewards, the fault is yours, you gods, That scant your graces to mortality, And niggards of your good, scarce spare the world One vertuous, for a thousand wicked men. It is no error to conferre dignity, But to bestow it on a vicious man; I gave the dignity, but you made the vice, Make you men good, and I'le make good men happy. That Plutus is refus'd, dismayes me not, He is my Drudge, and the externall pompe, In which he decks the World, proceeds from me, Not him; like Harmony, that not resides In strings, or notes, but in the hand and voyce. The revolutions of Empires, States, Scepters, and Crownes, are but my game and sport, Which as they hang on the events of Warre, So those depend upon my turning wheele. You warlike Squadrons, who in battels joyn'd, Dispute the Right of Kings, which I decide, Present the modell of that martiall frame, By which, when Crownes are stak'd, I rule the game. They dance the sixth Antimasque, being the representation of a Battell. Mom. Madam, I should censure you, pro falso clamore, for preferring a scandalous crosbill of recrimination against the gods, but your blindnesse shall excuse you. Alas! what would it advantage you, if vertue were as universall as vice is? it would onely follow, that as the world now exclaimes upon you for exalting the vicious, it would then raile as fast at you for depressing the vertuous; so they would still keepe their tune, though you chang'd their Ditty. Merc. The mists, in which future events are wrap'd, That oft succeed beside the purposes Of him that workes, his dull eyes not discerning The first great cause, offer'd thy clouded shape To his enquiring search; so in the darke The groping world first found thy Deity, And gave thee rule over contingencies, Which, to the piercing eye of Providence, Being fix'd and certaine, where past and to come, Are alwayes present, thou dost disappeare, Losest thy being, and art not all. Be thou then onely a deluding Phantome, At best a blind guide, leading blinder fooles; Who, would they but survay their mutuall wants, And helpe each other, there were left no roome For thy vaine ayd. Wisedome, whose strong-built plots Leave nought to hazard, mocks thy futile power. Industrious labour drags thee by the locks, Bound to his toyling Car, and not attending Till thou dispence, reaches his owne reward. Only the lazie sluggard yawning lyes Before thy threshold, gaping for thy dole, And licks the easie hand that feeds his sloath, The shallow, rash, and unadvised man Makes thee his stale, disburdens all the follies Of his mis-guided actions, on thy shoulders. Vanish from hence, and seeke those Ideots out That thy fantasticke god-head hath allow'd, And rule that giddy superstitious crowd. Hedone. Pleasure, a young woman with a smiling face, in a light lascivious habit, adorn'd with silver and gold, her Temples crown'd with a Garland of Roses, and over that a Rainbow circling her head downe to her shoulders. Hedone enters. Merc. What wanton's this? Mom. This is the sprightly Lady Hedone, a merry Gamester, this people call her Pleasure. Plea. The reasons (equall Iudges) here alleag'd By the dismist Pretenders, all concurre To strengthen my just title to the Spheare. Honour, or Wealth, or the contempt of both, Have in themselves no simple reall good, But as they are the meanes to purchase pleasure; The paths that lead to my delicious Palace; They for my sake, I for mine owne am priz'd. Beyond me nothing is, I am the Goale, The Iourneyes end, to which the sweating world, And wearied Nature travels. For this, the best And wisest sect of all Philosophers, Made me the seat of supreme happinesse. And though some, more austere, upon my ruines Did to the prejudice of Nature, raise Some petty low-built vertues, 'twas because They wanted wings to reach my soaring pitch, Had they beene Princes borne, themselves had prov'd Of all mankind the most luxurious. For those delights, which to their low condition Were obvious, they with greedy appetite Suck'd and devour'd: from offices of State, From cares of family, children, wife, hopes, feares Retir'd, the churlish Cynicke in his Tub Enjoy'd those pleasures which his tongue defam'd. Nor am I rank'd 'mongst the superfluous goods; My necessary offices preserve Each single man, and propogate the kind. Then am I universall as the light, Or common Ayre we breath; and since I am The generall desire of all mankind, Civill Felicity must reside in me. Tell me what rate my choycest pleasures beare, When for the short delight of a poore draught Of cheape cold water, great Lysimachus Rendred himselfe slave to the Scythians. Should I the curious structure of my seats, The art and beauty of my seuerall objects, Rehearse at large, your bounties would reserve For every sense a proper constellation; But I present their Persons to your eyes. Come forth my subtle Organs of delight, With changing figures please the curiouss eye, And charme the care with moving Harmony. They dance the seventh Antimasque of the five senses. Merc. Bewitching Syren, guilded rottennesse, Thou hast with cunning artifice display'd Th'enamel'd outside, and the honied verge Of the faire cup, where deadly poyson lurks, Within, a thousand sorrowes dance the round; And like a shell, Paine circles thee without, Griefe is the shadow waiting on thy steps, Which, as thy joyes 'ginne tow'rds their West decline, Doth to a Gyants spreading forme extend Thy Dwarfish stature. Thou thy selfe art Paine, Greedy, intense Desire, and the keene edge Of thy fierce Appetite, oft strangles thee, And cuts thy slender thread; but still the terrour And apprehension of thy hasty end, Mingles with Gall thy most refined sweets; Yet thy Cyrcæan charmes transforme the world. Captaines, that have resisted warre and death, Nations, that over Fortune have triumph'd, Are by thy Magicke made effeminate, Empires, that knew no limits but the Poles, Have in thy wanton lap melted away. Thou wert the Author of the first excesse That drew this reformation on the gods. Canst thou then dreame, those Powers, that from heaven have Banish'd th'effect, will there enthrone th'cause? To thy voluptuous Denne, fly Witch, from hence, There dwell, for ever drown'd in brutish sense. Mom. I concurre, and am growne so weary of these tedious pleadings, as I'le packe up too and be gone: Besides, I see a crowd of other suitors pressing hither, I'le stop 'em, take their petitions and preferre 'em above; and as I came in bluntly without knocking, and no body bid me welcome; so I'le depart as abruptly without taking leave, and bid no body fare-well. Merc. These, with forc'd reasons, and strain'd arguments, Vrge vaine pretences, whilst your Actions plead, And with a silent importunity Awake the drousie Iustice of the gods To crowne your deeds with immortality. The growing Titles of your Ancestors, These Nations glorious Acts, joyn'd to the stocke Of your owne Royall vertues, and the cleare Reflexe they take from th'imitation Of your fam'd Court, make Honours storie full, And have to that secure fix'd state advanc'd Both you and them, to which the labouring world, Wading through streames of blood, sweats to aspire. Those ancient Worthies of these famous Isles, That long have slept, in fresh and lively shapes Shall strait appeare, where you shall see your selfe Circled with moderne Heroes, who shall be In Act, what-ever elder times can boast, Noble, or Great; as they in Prophesie Were all but what you are. Then shall you see The sacred hand of bright Eternity Mould you to Stars, and fix you in the Spheare. To you, your Royall halfe, to them shee'll joyne Such of this traine, as with industrious steps In the faire prints your vertuous feet have made, Though with unequall paces, follow you. This is decreed by Iove, which my returne Shall see perform'd; but first behold the rude And old Abiders here, and in them view The point from which your full perfections grew. You naked, antient, wild Inhabitants, That breath'd this Ayre, and prest this flowery Earth, Come from those shades where dwels eternall night, And see what wonders Time hath brought to light. Atlas, and the Spheare vanisheth, and a new Scæne appeares of mountaines, whose eminent height exceed the Clouds which past beneath them, the lower parts were wild and woody: out of this place comes forth a more grave Antimasque of Picts, the naturall Inhabitants of this Isle, ancient Scots and Irish, these dance a Perica or Martiall dance. When this Antimasque was past, there began to arise out of the earth the top of a hill, which by little and little grew to bee a huge mountaine that covered all the Scæne; the under part of this was wild and craggy, and above somewhat more pleasant and flourishing: about the middle part of this Mountaine were seated the three kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland; all richly attired in regall habits, appropriated to the severall Nations, with Crownes on their heads, and each of them bearing the ancient Armes of the kingdomes there presented: At a distance above these sate a young man in a white embroydered robe, upon his faire haire an Olive Garland with wings at his shoulders, and holding in his hand a Cornucopia fill'd with corne and fruits, representing the Genius of these kingdomes.</field>

Here the fare victorious eyes Make Worth only Beauties prize, Here the hand of Vertue tyes 'Bout the heart lov's amorous chayne, Captives tryumph, Vassals reigne, And none live here but the slaine. CHORVS. These are th'Hisperian bowers, whose faire trees beare Rich golden fruit, and yet no Dragon near. GENIVS. Then, from your impris'ning wombe, Which is the cradle and the tombe Of Brittish Worthies (faire sonnes) send A troope of Heroes, that may lend Their hands to ease this loaden grove, And gather the ripe fruits of Love. KINGDOMES. 1. 2. 3. Open thy stony entrailes wide, And breake old Atlas, that the pride Of three fam'd kingdomes may be spy'd. CHORVS. Pace forth thou mighty Brittish Hercules, With thy choyce band, for only thou, and these, May revell here, in Loves Hesperides. At this the under-part of the Rocke opens, and out of a Cave are seene to come the Masquers richly attyred like ancient Heroes, the Colours yellow, embroydered with silver, their antique Helmes curiously wrought, and great plumes on the top; before them a troope of young Lords and Noble-mens sonnes, bearing Torches of Virgin-wax, these were apparelled after the old Brittish fashion in white Coats, embroydered with silver, girt, and full gathered, cut square coller'd, and round caps on their heads, with a white feather wreathen about them; first these dance with their lights in their hands: After which, the Masquers descend into the roome, and dance their entry. The dance being past, there appeares in the further part of the heaven comming downe a pleasant Cloud, bright and transparent, which comming softly downe-wards before the upper part of the mountaine, embraceth the Genius, but so as through it all his body is seene; and then rising againe with a gentle motion beares up the Genius of the three kingdomes, and being past the Airy Region, pierceth the heavens, and is no more seene: At that instant the Rocke with the three kingdomes on it sinkes, and is hidden in the earth. This strange spectacle gave great cause of admiration, but especially how so huge a machine, and of that great height could come from under the Stage, which was but six foot high. The second Song. KINGDOMES. 1. Here are shapes form'd fit for heaven, 2. Those move gracefully and even, 3. Here the Ayre and paces meet So just, as if the skilfull feet Had struck the Vials, 1. 2. 3. So the Eare Might the tunefull footing heare. CHORVS. And had the Musicke silent beene, The eye a moving tune had seene. GENIVS. These must in the unpeopled skie Succeed, and governe Destinie, Iove is temp'ring purer fire, And will with brighter flames attire These glorious lights. I must ascend And helpe the Worke. KINGDOMES. 1. We cannot lend Heaven so much treasure. 2. Nor that pay But rendring what it takes away. Why should they that here can move So well, be ever-fix'd above? CHORVS. Or be to one eternall posture ty'd, That can into such various figures slide. GENIVS. Iove shall not, to enrich the Skie, Beggar the Earth, their Fame shall fly From hence alone, and in the Spheare Kindle new Starres, whilst they rest here. KINGDOMES. 1., 2., 3. How can the shaft stay in the quiver, Yet hit the marke? GENIVS. Did not the River Eridanus, the grace acquire In Heaven and Earth to flow, Above in streames of golden fire, In silver waves below? KINGDOMES. 1., 2., 3. But shall not we, now thou art gone Who wert our Nature, wither, Or breake that triple Vnion Which thy soule held together? GENIVS. In Concords pure immortall spring I will my force renew, And a more active Vertue bring At my returne. Adieu. Kingdomes adieu, Chorvs adieu. The Masquers dance their maine dance; which done, the Scæne againe is varied into a new and pleasant prospect, cleane differing from all the other, the nearest part shewing a delicious Garden with severall walkes and perterra's set round with low trees, and on the sides against these walkes, were fountaines and grots, and in the furthest part a Palace, from whence went high walkes upon Arches, and above them open Tarraces planted with Cypresse trees, and all this together was composed of such Ornaments as might expresse a Princely Villa. From hence the Chorus descending into the roome, goes up to the States The third Song. By the Chorus going up to the Queene. VVhilst thus the Darlings of the Gods From Honours Temple, to the Shrine Of Beauty, and these sweet abodes Of Love, we guide, let thy Divine Aspects (Bright Deity) with faire And Halcyon beames, becalme the Ayre, We bring Prince Arthur, or the brave St. George himselfe (great Queene) to you, You'll soone discerne him; and we have A Guy, a Beavis, or some true Round-Table Knight, as everfought For Lady, to each Beauty brought. Plant in their Martiall hands, War's seat, Your peacefull pledges of warm snow, And, if a speaking touch, repeat In Loves knowne language, tales of woe; Say, in soft whispers of the Palme, As eyes shoot darts, so Lips shed Balme. For though you seeme like Captives, led In triumph by the Foe away, Yet on the Conqu'rers necke you tread, And the fierce Victor proves your prey, What heart is then secure from you, That can, though vanquish'd, yet subdue? The Song done they retire, and the Masquers dance the Revels with the Ladies, which continued a great part of the night. The Revels being past, and the Kings Majestie seated under the State by the Queene; for Conclusion to this Masque there appeares comming forth from one of the sides, as moving by a gentle wind, a great Cloud, which arriving at the middle of the heaven, stayeth; this was of severall colours, and so great, that it covered the whole Scæne. Out of the further part of the heaven begins to breake forth two other clouds, differing in colour and shape; and being fully discovered there appeared sitting in one of them, Religion, Truth, and Wisdome. Religion was apparelled in white, and part of her face was covered with a light vaile, in one hand a Booke, and in the other a flame of fire. Truth in a Watchet Robe, a Sunne upon her fore-head and bearing in her hand a Palme, Wisedome in a mantle wrought with eyes and hands, golden rayes about her head, and Apollo's Cithera in her hand. In the other Cloud sate Concord, Government, and Reputation. The habit of Concord was Carnation, bearing in her hand a little faggot of sticks bound together, and on the top of it a hart, and a garland of corne on her head: Government was figured in a coat of Armour, bearing a shield, and on it a Medusa's head; upon her head a plumed helme, and in her right hand a Lance. Reputation, a young man in a purple robe wrought with gold, and wearing a laurell wreath on his head. These being come downe in an equall distance to the middle part of the Ayre, the great Cloud began to breake open, out of which stroke beames of light; in the midst suspended in the Ayre, sate Eternity on a Globe, his Garment was long of a light blue, wrought all over with Stars of gold, and bearing in his hand a Serpent bent into a circle, with his tayle in his mouth. In the firmament about him, was a troope of fifteene stars, expressing the stellifying of our Brittish Heroes; but one more great and eminent than the rest, which was over his head, figured his Majestie. And in the lower part was seene a farre off the prospect of Windsor Castle, the famous seat of the most honourable Order of the Garter. The fourth Song. Eternity, Eusebia, Alethia, Sophia, Homononia, Dicæarche, Euphemia. ETERNITIE. Be fix'd your rapid Orbes, that beare The changing seasons of the yeare On your swift wings, and see the old Decrepit Spheares growne darke and cold; Nor did Iove quench her fires, these bright Flames, have ecclips'd her sullen light: This Royall Payre, for whom Fate will Make Motion cease, and Time stand still; Since Good is here so perfect, as no Worth Is left for After-Ages to bring forth. EVSEBIA. Mortality cannot with more Religious zeale, the gods adore. ALETHIA. My Truths, from humane eyes conceal'd, Are naked to their sight reveal'd. SOPHIA. Nor doe their Actions, from the guide Of my exactest precepts slide. HOMONOIA. And as their owne pure Soules entwin'd, So are their Subjects hearts combin'd. DICÆARCHE. So just, so gentle is their sway, As it seemes Empire to obey. EVPHEMIA. And their faire Fame, like incense hurl'd On Altars, hath perfum'd the world. SO. Wisedome. AL. Truth. EVS. Pure Adoration. HO. Concord. DI. Rule. EVP. Cleare Reputation. CHORVS. Crowne this King, this Queene, this Nation. CHORVS Wisedome, Truth, &amp;c. ETERNITIE. Brave Spirits, whose adventrous feet Have to the Mountaines top aspir'd, Where faire Desert, and Honour meet, Here, from the toyling Presse retyr'd, Secure from all disturbing Evill, For ever in my Temple revell. With wreathes of Starres circled about, Guild all the spacious Firmament, And smiling on the panting Routs That labour in the steep ascent, With your resistlesse influence guide Of humane change th'incertaine tide. EVS. ALE. SOP. But oh you Royall Turtles, shed, When you from Earth remove, On the ripe fruits of your chaste bed, Those sacred seeds of Love. CHORVS. Which no Power can but yours dispence, Since you the patterne beare from hence. HOM. DIC. EVP. Then from your fruitfull race shall flow Endlesse succession. Scepters shall bud, and Lawrels blow 'Bout their Immortall Throne. CHORVS. Propitious Stars shall crowne each birth, Whilst you rule them, and they the Earth. The Song ended, the two Clouds, with the person sitting on them, ascend; the great Cloud closeth againe, and so passeth away overthwart the Scæne; leaving behind it nothing but a Serene Sky. After which, the Masquers dance their last dance, and the Curtaine was let fall. FINIS.</field>
