      <field name="fulltext">Some dare affirm that Comedies may teach More in one hour than some in ten can preach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Argument out of ARISTOPHANES. Cramulus a Just man, but now grown low, Consults the Oracle his life to mend; Follow him first, that doth before you go, The answer is, and he your Woes shall end. He hasts this happy guide to overtake, Who Plutus proves, a man long blind; He strives at home this Friend his Guest to make, And that this common joy the World may find: Of Esculapius he by Sacrifice Obtains his long lost sight for to restore; That so the Fools and Knaves, and not the Wise, And Virtuous, hereafter should be poore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. Cramulus. Carion his Servant. Plutus. Chorus of Country men. Blapsidamus. Poverty. Cramulus his Wife. Just Man. Unjust Man. Sicophantus. Old Woman. Young Man. Mercury. Priest of Jove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Carion. O Jupiter! what a hard age is this to be a Servant in, Especially to a foolish Master; if a servant shall Give never so good Counsel, his word will not Be taken, his Master thinks himself wiser, and so His Family is bound to suffer with him; for 'tis the mischief We are not Masters of our own bodies, But they that buy us; and not much unlike This Case of ours, and slavery, is that my Master is in now By Apollo, with his ambiguous answers from his three- Footed throne: Nor is it with injustice I complain of him, Who though he be counted a great Prophet and a Physician, Yet he hath sent my Master from him sick, And I think half mad with Melancholy, For yonder he follows a blind man step by step; I have heard of seeing men leading the blind, But never of blind men leading those that can see before: And ask him what he means by it, And he answers you not a syllable; I can no longer hold my tongue, [Enter Cramulus.] Unless you will tell me why we follow this Fellow thus; Nay, I will vex you, for I know you dare not strike me, Whilest I carry your Bag. Cram. No, yet if you be troublesome I shall take Away the Bag, and then beat you. Car. Well, I will not be quieted untill I know who this is. Cram. Well, because thou art in my esteeme the most Faithful and secret of all my Family, I will not Conceal this from thee, thou knowest I have lived Religiously with both Gods and Men, and yet alwayes have Lived poor and miserable. Car. 'Tis very True. Cram. And yet they that Rob the very Churches, the Rethoricians, Sycophants, every Rascal grows rich. Car. I grant you. Cram. I went therefore to consult the Oracle about my Son, that since my own miserable life is now almost Spent, and past redress, whether it were not best for him To change his manners betimes, shake off his honour, and Learn to be as cunning a knave as he can; For 'tis that onely conduces to living well. Car. And what said Phæbus to this? Cram. That you shall hear; he plainly told me, That whosoever I met first, I should never Leave him 'till I had got him into my house, If it were possible. Car. And this I warrant was he. Cram. The very same. Car. You need not have obeyed the Oracles Counsel, you simple fellow in this; for the words carry enough in Them, for follow the man you first met, implies As much, as let your Son live by the ordinary customes And crafts he sees others use, that I warrant you Was Apollo his meaning. Cram. How conjecture you this? Car. Why a blind man may see it, For it profits no body in our age To be honest as you say, therefore still do as others do, And be as other men are. Cram. This is not all Carion, we shall better Know the mind of the Oracle by enquiring Of this fellow whence he is, and what he wants, And how he came hither. [Ex. Om.] Enter again Plutus, Cramulus and Carion. Car. Come Sir, let us know who you are. Cram. Yes, and tell us quickly too. Plu. I say to the Parish. Car. Do you hear him? Cram. He speaks to thee, thou dost question him Too roughly; Sir, I pray you, if the fair words Of an honest man can prevail upon you, Let us know your qualities. Plu. I say unto thee lament. Car. Is this all the Oracle will do for us. Cram. If you do not tell me, you shall have no Cause to laugh, for I will destroy thee. Plu. I say leave me, get you gone. Cram. By no means. Car. Master I'le tell you what's best, let me lead This blind fellow to some Precipice, and I'le steal from him and let him break His neck. Cram. do so. Plu. Hold, hold. Car. Will you speak then? Plu. If you should know what kind a man I am, I know You would use me cruelly, and not Let me go neither. Cram. Wee'l promise you the contratry, if you will speak. Plu. Lay your hands off me then first. Cram. Well said, 'tis done. Plu. Observe me well then, since I am forced To reveal what I thought to have kept Secret, I am Plutus. Cram. Then thou art the basest sordid thing alive: Is it possible, art thou Plutus! Car. Art thou Plutus with that miserable face And durty cloaths, O Phæbus, Apollo, Gods and Divels! But art thou he? Plu. Yes surely. Cram. Thou the man? Plu. Even very he. Cram. But whence commeff thou in these Pitiful rusty cloaths. Plu. I come from the house of Patroclus, one that Never since he was born could afford himself water. Cram. But how comest thou to suffer all this misery. Plu. Why Jupiter brought all the evils of my life upon me, Because he envied the good of mankind; for when I was young I was advised to leave Evil company, and live with the just and modest and The learned, but Jupiter put out my eies that I might Not discern them from others, such an ill will He himself bears to honest men. Cram. And yet he himself receives true honour Onely from honest men. Plu. 'Tis true. Cram. But if you had your sight again, would you Hereafter fly such base company? Plu. For certain. Cram. And live amongst honest men? Plu. Without doubt, for 'tis a long time since I saw Any such. Cram. That's no wonder, for I that have my eye-sight Scarce ever saw any. Plu. Well, now let me go, for you know all I can tell you. Cram. No, by Jove, we will now rather embrace you More Earnestly then ever. Plu. Did not I tell you what trouble you would give me? Cram. Let me intreat you to give your self into my hands For ever, and when you know me, though I say it, you will Not find an honester man. Plu. Yes, so you all say, but when you have injoyed me And grown rich, then you mind nothing but mischief and Malice. Cram. 'Tis true, but we are not all alike. Plu. By Jove all one. Car. A good deed to cudgel him. Cram. But that you may know how much good You shall have by living with me, you shall Understand, I hope God willing to get you your sight Again. Plu. Not of all things, I dare not see again. Cram. How is this? Car. This fellow is certainly born to be Miserable. Plu. If Jupiter should know I were about such a business, He would destroy me. Cram. Can he hurt thee worse then to let thee go wandring Up and down thus? Plu. I do not know what it is, but I fear him monstrously. Cram. Is it possible? thou greatest of all cowards, Why dost thou think Jove or his thunder would be valued At a straw if thou hadst thy eyes again never so little A while. Plu. O be not so profane. Cram. Have patience, and I'le make it appear to thee Thou hast more power then Jove. Plu. Who me? Cram. Yes, for by what dost thou think Jupiter Commands all? Car. By mony, of which he hath abundance. Cram. Pray where hath he the mony? Car. Of this fellow. Cram. And with what do men sacrifice to Jove with? Is it not with this fellow? Car. And what do they sacrifice for, but to get him? For all their prayers are to be rich. Cram. Are not you all in all then, and if you say but The word, all this will be at an end. Plu. How can that be? Cram. Because no body can sacrifice Oxen or Sheep if You forbid them. Plu. Wherefore? Cram. Why, how can he buy any thing to sacrifice with- Out thee, so that you see, if Jove be troublesome, You know what to do with him. Plu. Is it with me and for me, say you then, that men Sacrifice? Cram. I say so by Jove, and moreover, whatever is famous Or esteemed amongst men, thou art Author of, For money rules all. Car. Why, you see with a little money I am bought And made a Slave of, because I had none my self. Cram. And you know the Corinthian Women when poverty Tempts them are seldome perswaded, but if mony be To be had, then they are brought to reason And to be active, that makes them Wagtailes. Car. And the same thing the Boyes do for reward, Not for love. Cram. Nay, but you speak of those that are of low Quality, for the best sort of these scorn mony. Car. What do they seek else? Cram. Why, a good horse or hounds is a tempting Present. Car. They are too proud perhaps to take mony, and Therefore under this pretext hide their Avarice, but 'tis all one, mony and monies worth. Cram. All arts, all cheats are invented for thy sake, Plutus; the one is a Cobler, th'other a Cutler, Th'other a Carpenter, another a Gold-melter For thy sake even of that gold thou gavest him; And as arts, so are all thefts still, For thy sake, men taken in adultery Have their torture given to them. Plu. What a wretch am I, who till now never Knew all this! Cram. What makes the King of Persia triumph so Think you? Car. What are all Conventions and Sects of men Gathered for? Cram. And tell me what mans and furnishes The Greek Navies that are set out? Car. Or what sustaines the great Corinthian Armies? Cram. And gives Pamphilus such cause of sorrow? Car. Yes, and Belonopolus his partner. Cram. What makes Argyrius I pray you fart as he goes Up and down? Car. And for thy sake Phelisius tells us all his Fine stories. Cram. And 'tis thou that aidest the Egyptians. Car. And for thee Lais loves Philonides. Cram. You set your shoulder against Timotheus his Tower And threw it down. Car. Good and bad, all things are done for thy sake. Cram. And in war, on that side the mony lies, there goes The Victory. Plu. Can I do all this? Cram. Yes, by Jove, and more, of all other things there Is an end, But of enjoying thee, and that hath no saciety. Car. Of bread. Cram. Of Banqueting. Car. Of Musick. Cram. Of Ambition. Car. Of Rule. Cram. But he that hath ten Talents of thee, would then Have twenty, then forty, and still if he have not more, Thinks he lives but languishingly. Plu. Gentlemen, me thinks you discourse well, I fear but one thing. Cram. What I prethee. Plu. That I shall not be able to exercise all this power You give me. Cram. I see, 'tis a good saying, that mony is a Coward. Plu. Nothing so, but a thief that came into my house, Because he could carry nothing away, reported I locked My self up, and hid my self for fear, which I did for Providence. Cram. Well, take you no care, if you be but willing, I'le take order you shall see as well as Lynceus. Plu. How can you do this, being but a mortal man? Cram. Hope well from what Phæbus but now said to me, And shook his Lawrel at me too. Plu. Hast thou him of thy Counsel also. Cram. For certain? Plu. Have a care what you do? Cram. Trouble not your self, I'le pawn my head, I Know how to bring this about. Car. And I mine too. Cram. We will have help enough too of all those, who Because they are honest men, scarce have bread to eat. Plu. Those are but pitiful friends though me thinks. Cram. They will not be so thought when we have made Them rich again; but Carion make hast, run. Car. What to do? Cram. Call all my neighbours, you will find them Perhaps busie at Plow, bid them leave off and be here Presently, tell them every one shall have a part Of Plutus with us. Car. I am gone; but who will take care of this victuals Here, which I have bought for Dinner. Cram. Leave that to me, and now Plutus the most excellent Amongst all the Gods, enter here with me, this is my House, which this day thou shalt make rich. Plu. I beseech you excuse me, 'tis very troublesome to Me to go into another mans house, especially one that I am Not acquainted with; for I never have any good by it; if I happen into a mans house, why then I am thrust presently Under ground, and stifled, and if any of his friends come In necessity, and ask for me to help him, he denies me, and Sweares he saw me not of I know not how long, And if I fall into a prodigal mans hands, why then I am Divided amongst Whores, or lost at Dice in a moment, And so we are both turned naked out of dores. Cram. You have not met with moderate men, I am one That on occasion can spend, and then again spare, but pray You enter, I long till my Wife and my Son see you, who Are two, next to thee, I love best of all the World. Plu. That I easily believe. Cram. Why should I not speak truth? [Ex. om.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Carion and Chorus of Countrymen. Gar. You, all friends and neighbours, poor and laborious, That have lived with us upon Onions and hard fare, Now make hast and make use of the present occasion Whilest it is offered. Chor. We are ready you see, and make what hast we can, Considering we are men toyled with labour and oppressed VVith Age, you cannot expect we should keep pace with You, therefore tell us first why your master sends for us? Car. I have told you this good while, but cannot get you To lift up your long Ears to it, that my master bid me tell You, that you shall all leave this sorrowful careful life that You now lead, and exchange it for a pleasant one. Chor. By what means, or from whence does he hope this. Car. Neighbours, my master will be here presently, And brings with him an old, crooked, ill-faced, unlucky, Bald, and I think, I may say curtailed fellow. Chor. O thou art a golden mellonger, what brave news Is this? by thy description this must needs be a heap of Gold that's coming to us. Car. Or rather a heap of all the old worldly evils. Chor. VVell, do not think you shall go unpunished. You bring us thus far upon our Crutches for nothing but to Delude us. Car. You think me a man naturally so given to jest, That I can say nothing in earnest. Chor. We shall make your bones ake by and by, you knave. Car. Yes, when you have took your lots out of the Urne, and are Judges in Athens, and these Cudgels you have In your hands, your wands, but Charon will have you if His boat before that day comes. Chor. Come, you are a prating fellow to delude us thus All this while; in not telling plainly why your Master sent For us, especially knowing what business we have, and yet The hast we have made over hedge and ditch to get hither. Car. Well, I will no longer conceal the busines, my Master hath got Plutus into his house, and you are all sent For to be made rich. Chor. Is that possible we can be all made rich? Car. As rich as you would wish, every one a Midas and Such goodly asses as he was, so you shall have. Chor. How I am delighted with this! I could dance for Joy if I thought this were true. Car. Do so, you shall follow dancing like my Sheep, my Kids, or rather like my gray Bearded lascivious Goats, And I before you will represent the Cyclops. Chor. And we in like manner will follow you our Cyclops; But if we catch you eating the best Sallats and hearbs From us, as you go, and then when your belly is full fall Asleep by the way, we shall order you with these Cudgels. Car. Then will I imitate Circen, and feed you with Hearbs that will metamorphose you into Swine, and then (as Ulysses did) feed you with Sir reverence, and you shall Go grunting on, and like hoggs follow one another. Chor. And we seeing our Circen go about to poyson us, Will imitate Ulysses, and hang you up by your two Stones, and slit your Nose, and then 'noint it with a Sir reverence, and you like Aristillus shall laugh and cry, Piggs follow your mother. Car. Well, let us leave our Jests, and now we are at our Journies end, every one put himself into his own shape Again; I'le go in a private way first, and fill my belly, And then wee'l to the great work in hand. [Ex. om.] Enter Cramulus and Chorus. Cram. Neighbours, to say you are wellcome, is in my Opinion an old dull complement, therefore I will salute You after a new manner, and with open armes, tell you, That to recompence the haste and pains you have taken In coming, if you will be still as diligent in your own Good, you shall enjoy Plutus with no. Chor. Never fear, we will be as laborious and indefatigable As Mars, and sure if we should stick at Trifles in this Business, we were worthy to have Plutus slip out of our Fingers. Car. I see Blapsidamus coming yonder, who by his hast Me thinks comes as if he knew something of this business That hath hapned to me. [Ex. om.] Enter Blapsidamus and Cramulus. Blap. What is the matter I pray thee? how comes it to Pass my Cramulus, thou shouldst be so soon be grown rich? I could not believe it, though it was all the news At the Barbers, by every one as soon as he Was set down in his Chair. Its newes to me if you be so fortunate to see you call all Your friends thus about you to partake with you, and against Our Countries custome I am sure. Cram. Blapsidamus, I will keep nothing from thee, 'Tis true, the World is otherwise with me to day then it was Yesterday, and you shall find it so, because you are my friend. Blap. Are you then so rich as it is said? Cram. I shall be presently if it please God; but there Is some hazard alwayes in such great works. Blap. What's the danger? Cram. 'Tis thus. Blap. Speak On freely as you have begun. Cram. If the matter hit right, we are all Made; if not, all Undone. Blap. That's sad, and pleases me not by no means, For to be so marvellous rich, and so mavellously affraid is Not the custome of those that get it honestly. Cram. How, not honestly? Blap. I fear you have robb'd Apollo's Temple, And now repent you. Cram. Apollo forbid! I never did such a trick yet. Blap. Come, never triffle with me, 'tis so I know. Cram. Prethee do not think so ill of me. Blap. O Gods! there is nothing but villany in the world, The hearts of men are set upon nothing but Avarice. Cram. Why, I think you are wild. Blap. How different is this from the manners of the rest Of his Life. Cram. By Heaven! thou art mad. Blap. A man may see by the uncertainty of his countenance, And the rowling of his eyes, the villany he hath done. Cram. Now I know why all this is, if I had stole any Thing, by this way you think to get half, is it not so? Blap. How? I rob a thief, what's this? Cram. Well, there is no theft in the business, what I am About is quite of another kind I assure you. Blap. May be you will say it was not stole but took Away. Cram. Thou art possessed with a Divel surely to Talk thus. Blap. There is a third way yet, have you not cozened Some body by some notorious fraud of their mony? Cram. No certainly. Blap. Why, then I know not which way to get the truth Out, unless you will confess. Cram. Why, will you then condemne me before you Hear me? Blap. Not I friend, but on the contrary would have brought You out of your danger with little cost, and before the Matter had been known amongst the people, we would Have stopped the Orators mouths with a little mony. Cram. You are a kind friend to me, that for the laying Out of a shilling would look to get twelve. Blap. Methinks I see thee saw with thy Olive branch in Thy hand, and thy wife and children sitting about thee Miserably prostrate before the Tribunal, We want Pamphilles to draw this Picture methinks. Cram. I tell thee I am so far from taking any thing from Others, that my design is to make all honest frugal men Richer then they are. Blap. Say you so, have you stole such abundance indeed? Cram. Will you destroy me with talking thus. Blap. Nay, it seems you will destroy your self. Cram. With what, I tell thee I have Plutus himself at My house. Blap. You Plutus, what Plutus? Cram. Why, the very god Himself. Blap. Where is he? Cram. Why, within there. Blap. Where? Cram. Why, I tell thee at my house. Blap. Plutus in thy house, go hang thy self, I'le never Believe it. Cram. By the gods 'tis true. Blap. Wilt thou swear by Vesta? Cram. And by Neptune too. Blap. What Neptune, of the Seas? Cram. Yes, and by the other too, if there be one. Blap. And will you lend him now and then To some of your friends? Cram. Soft, yea, it is not come to that yet. Blap. Say you so, must he not stir out of your house? Cram. Somewhat is first to be done. Blap. VVhat is that? Cram. VVhy, he must be helped to his sight before He can go abroad. Blap. Is he then blind for certain? Cram. Nothing so Sure. Blap. Somewhat I thought was in it, that he never Could find the way into my house. Cram. All in good time, he will be there now godwilling Shortly. Blap. Were we not best get a Physitian to him? Cram. VVhat Physician is here in this City? here is no art Understood here, because there is no reward. Blap. Let us consider. Cram. You will find none but that which I have Long since thought on is best, which is to carry Him to Esculapius his Temple. Blap. You have said well, therefore let us make no delay. Cram. I am just now going [Ex. om.] Enter Poverty an old Woman, Cramulus, Blapsidamus. Pover. O the impudent wickedness that you pitiful Men have undertaken! whither do you fly? Cram. Hercules, what have we here? Pover. Nay, I will be the destruction of you both, for You have undertaken that which neither God nor Man Durst go about. Cram. VVhat art thou that lookest so pale and lean? Blap. May be it is Erinnis, one of the furies presented In the Tragedies, by her face she should. Cram. No, she wants a torch in her hand. Blap. Nay, then wee'l be bold with her. Pover. Whom do you take me for. Cram. A Bawd, a scolding Eggwife, Or else you would never trouble us thus, that never Have done you any injury. Pover. Is it no injury (think you) to throw me out of Every house where I come? Cram. Nay, thou art sure to have one house left thee, The prison, but tell us what thou art. Pover. What punishment do you deserve (think you) for Seeking to take me that am innocent out of the VVorld Thus. Blap. VVhat will you say if this be a neighbour of mine That keeps a Victualling house, and poysons me and all The street with base wine. Pover. I am Poverty, you know me well enough sure? For I have frequented many of your houses a good many Years I am sure, and waited diligently upon you. Blap. O Phæbus Apollo! whither shall we run, How shall we get away from thee. Cram VVhat a pitiful fearful fellow art thou, whither Dost thou run, stay for shame. Blap. By no means, not I. Cram. Fie on't, what shall one VVoman drive away Two men? Blap. VVhy, is there any animal so dreadful in the VVorld, and infectious as Poverty? Cram. Prethee stay. Blap. By Jove not I. Cram. Nay, but let me tell you 'twill be a shamful thing For us to forsake yonder God within, and run I know not VVhither for fear of this old VVitch, let us stand to it. Blap. VVith what armes I pray you can we defend our Selves, what breast-plate will not she pierce, and what Spear did ever keep her off? Cram. Take courage, our God will give us victory Against this wicked VVoman, I warrant you. Pover. Dare you take of holy things that have such A wickedness in hand? Cram. VVhat do you raile at us for thus, that have done You no injury, you old Divel? Pover. Do you think you do me no hurt in seeking Thus to get Plutus his eyes again? Cram. VVhat hurt is it to thee to bring all mankind A benefit. Pover. What good will it bring to men think you? Cram. First of all, we shall throw you out of Greece. Pover. Throw me out? why, what greater hurt can you do In the World. Cram. Why, it would be a greater to let it alone And not do it. Pov. Then before you go any further I will shew you the Reason of this matter, and demonstrate that I am the cause Of all good to you, and that by my help onely you subsist In this life, if I do not proceed as you will, And use me as you please. Cram. What an impudent creature art thou to talk thus! Pov. If you will suffer your self to be taught, I will Clearly shew you, you are out of the way If you would make the just man rich. Cram. O for the Pillory or the stocks to deliver me Of thee! Pov. You ought not to complain before you have heard Me. Cram. Who can forbear to cry out miserably that hears This? Pov. No wise man makes such a Noise. Cram. But will you submit to punishment, if you do not Make this good? Pov. Do what you can invent. Blap. 'Tis well. Pov. But if I have the better of you, you shall pay for it. Blap. Yes, twenty lives if we had them. Cram. Our two is enough for us to lose I warrant you. Pov. I were too blame to ask more. [Ex. om.] Enter Chorus, Cramulus, Blapsidamus, Poverty. Chor. Let us now fall to the matter in hand, and decide The controversy by true reason, laying all jests and Scurrility aside. Chor. In the first place then I think it plain to all men, That it is equity that honest men ought to be happiest, And the unjust only to be opprest with ill fortune; The which things considered, we are now taking the way To it that is most probable, for if Plutus can recover his eyes Again, and not go groping up and down thus; He will live Onely amongst honest men, and such as are Piously Given: now judge you whether there can be a better Counsel then this. Blap. I'le be witness, no body can complain of this. Chor. For if we will but consider, the lives of Mankind, as Things now stand, we shall find it madness to see how for the Most part the wicked abound with riches unjustly gotten, Whilest honest men are ready to starve, and spend their Dayes with this Lady; There is therefore no good to be Done, without Plutus have his eyes again. Pov. O ye most vain and Credulous of all mankind Companions in Dotage and trifles; If that you desire Should come to pass, what good would it be to you? for If Plutus should see again, he would distribute Equally to all men: and then I pray you who would care To study Arts or Trades? who would build your Ships or Your Coaches? Nay, you must even mend your own shooes Your selves, and plow, and sow, and reap, or else you must Not eat, you thought I warrant you to live at ease and out Of care. Cram. You deceive your self, we will keep servants to do All this you have recorded. Pov. Who will serve you, or whence will you have them? Cram. Wee'l buy them with our mony. Pov. Who will sell them you, when they have as Much mony as you? Cram. Some Merchant of Thessaly greedy of gain, That bring us Slaves from those that steal them Out of the suburbs, and by-places I warrant you Will furnish us. Pov. Where will you find any body to steal, when no Body is in want? you may steal your selves too as well as Work; and thus by being rich, be much more miserable Then you were before. Chor. May this misery fall upon thine own head for Belying us thus. Pov. Neither shall you sleep any more upon your fine Beds and Carpets, for indeed you shall have none to lie on, Who will make them? for as you say every body shall have Mony enough: where will you get rich perfumes? you Must not think then to walk in such pomp in the streets When you bring your Brides home; and now if you Want all these things, judge you whether any body will Account you rich, what will Plutus do you good, and yet From me you enjoy all this and all else you have need of, I am the imperious Mistris of all Artists, and stand by them Untill they are glad to find any way to support their lives. Chor. Prethee what canst thou do for any body, but help Them to Biles and Botches, and starve them with Hunger, fill them with lice and gnats without number, with A dreadful noise, driving away their sleep, bidding them Arise, and try some means to prevent starving. Besides this, instead of a whole Cloak thou givest them half A one, and instead of a bed to sleep in, a Mat to lie awake Upon, for curtaines and coverlids, rags, and for a pillow a Stone, Mallows for bread, and grass instead of Sallets, and For an easy seat, an old barrel with the head beaten out; Have not I now shewed at large the good you do? Pov. No, these are not of my evils, these belong to Beggery, not Poverty. Chor. Yet we count poverty and beggery are sisters. Pov. You do perhaps, and it may be you compare Dionysius with Thrasibulus; but my life hath none of This in it, it is the begger that hath nothing to live upon; The poor live sparingly upon what they have, And order so their affairs, that though they may be said In effect to have nothing, yet they want nothing. Chor. O what a happy life is this! you tell us of poverty, If after all our time spent in labour to get and To keep, there scarce remain enough to bury us. Pov. You spend your time in cavilling and jests, and do Not seriously weigh the matter, nor do you seriously consider That I give men better wits and persons too then Plutus Can; for what does he give, but gouty legs, fat bellies? But with me men are active, and slender-bodied, and of Warlike shape. Chor. And all this they get by being famished with Hunger. Pov. Moreover, for what concernes the modesty and Vertue of living, I can say more that they onely belong To me, and that from Plutus comes nothing but riots and Injuring of others. Chor. What is your modesty, to steal and break houses. Blap. Nay, the modesty lies in hiding himself when he Hath done. Pov. Do but observe the Orators and Rethoricians while They are poor, how equally and justly they carry themselves between the People and the Citizens, but they Are no sooner rich, but they lay Plots presently to betray The lower Sort, and cause Wars among them. Cram. Though I do not love thee, I cannot but confess this to be true of thee, but yet you shall not scape us, for Going about to prove Poverty better then Wealth. Pov. Yet you disprove it not methinks, but wrangle and Jest and talk Idly. Cram. Why, tell us then if thou beest so excellent; why Does every body fly from thee so? Pov. Why? because I would make them better and Honester, as Children do that avoid their Parents, because They give them good Counsell and Correction; 'tis a hard Thing for any body to distinguish good from bad. Cram. Do you think then that Jove doth not distinguish? You see he is rich, and gives it to us too as a blessing. Pov. O ye dull Saturnine wits! why Jove himself is A begger, and that I'le prove to you; For if he were rich, when he institutes his Olimpick Games in Greece, sure he would never reward the Conquerors with an Olive branch and a large oration, But he would give them Gold. Cram. This shews rather how Jupiter loves Gold, by his Parting with it so sparingly; he gives away things of less Value, and keeps that for himself. Pov. If it be so, you lay a worse fault to him then Poverty Gives any body, having so much wealth notwithstanding To be still so greedy. Cram. I think Jove will have cause to crown you with That Olive brance you spoke off for this victory ouer us. Pov. Well, these jests contradict nothing of what I say, Namely that all good comes of Poverty. Cram. Ask Hecate then if it be not best to be rich; For the rich make her a feast, but the poor do nothing but come in and eat it, therefore let's talk no more, for I am resolved never to yield, though thou shouldest overcome me. Pov. Then Argos do thou hear and take compassion of me. Cram. Nay, rather call upon Pausonus thy companion. Pov. Miserable creature what will become of me! Chor. Get thee from me, and I care not. Pov. Whether shall I go, into what Country? Cram. Into the Stocks, or to the Gallows; come away. Pov. The time will come you'l wish for me. Cram. Come not before that day, Till I am weary of being rich. Blap. Well, when I am once rich, I'le keep jovial company, feast, and bath, and sit in plenty, and fart at Poverty. Enter again Cramulus and Blapsidamus. Cram. At length we are got quit of this old Woman, And now Blapsidamus let it be our business as soon as we Can, to carry Plutus unto Esculapius his Temple. Blap. We had need dispatch, lest some body come in and interrupt us. Cram. Within there's Carion, make every thing Ready and bring Plutus to the Temple, with the usual Ceremonies. [Ex. om.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Carion and Chorus. Car. Come all you happy in your old age Who in the dayes of Thesius lived in Poverty and Scarcity of bread, this is the day that I pronounce all Honest men happy. Chor. O the blessed news, that thou art the messenger to thy poor companions! Car. The business is brought now about by my Master, For Plutus that you all know hath been so long Blind, now sees with perfect eyes, and all by the help Of the most famous Esculapius. Chor. Marry, this is pleasant news. Car. 'Twill make you rejoyce whether you will or no. Chor. Praised be the high-born powerful Esculapius, Thou great glory to Mankind. [Ex. om.] Enter Cramulus his Wife and Carion. Wife. What a noise and knocking is hear to day, I pray God it be a messenger of some good? I have been all day at home expecting Carion, And now he is come. Car. Come Mistris, fetch some wine quickly, for I know First 'tis that you love, and then next, because I bring you such a heap of good newes, I deserve some. Wife. Where is it? Car. I am about to tell it you. Wife. Dispatch in few words. Car. Hearken well, &amp; I will tell you all from head to foot Wife. So it do not trouble my head, I care not. Car. As soon as we came to the God Esculapius Carrying with us (then the most unhappy, and now a most happy) Plutus if any one were ever so, first of all we threw him into the sea and washed him well. Wife. Would that make an old man as he is happy? To put him into cold water? Car. Afterwards when he came before Esculapius, And had laid our Sacrifices on the Altar, with several Musicks playing, we made Plutus lie down every one assisting in the Ceremony. Wife. Were there any more that sought help from Esculapius? Car. There was one Heoclides, who though blind 'tis thought in robbing and cozenage can exceed the theefes that see best, besides many others troubled with all sorts of evils: now after a little Priest that waited upon the Ceremonies had put out all the lights, and we were laid to Sleep, and a general silence commanded; I was only kept Awake by a pleasant favour that came into my nose of a Hot Pudding, that the old Woman was eating behind me; At which I crept towards her, to see if I could steal some: And at length, lifting my head a little up, I saw a Priest go round every Altar in order, and take all the fruit and nuts, and things that was good, and put them in his wallet; Thought I, sure there is some great Sanctity in this kind of Theft, so I fell faster on upon the Pudding. Wife. Thou wretched fellow, wast not thou afraid Of the God when thou didst this? Car. Yes, I was afraid he would have come with his Robe and his Garland and gravely have stole my Pudding from me; for that his Priest had taught me: But when the old Woman heard the noise of my chops Going, she began to reach out her hand as she lay and feel For her Pudding, the which I had now almost made an End off, but she feeling the pot there, thought her Pudding Safe, and I crept away as silent as a Snake, and with my Belly full layed my self to sleep. Wife. And did not Esculapius yet appear to you? Car. Not yet: but when he did come, it was my ill luck, my belly growing now burdened with pudding to fall into such a fit of farting. Wife. Was not that enough to make him destroy thee? Car. No, only Jaso that followed the Gods blushed at it, and Parocæa stopping her nose, turned aside: For I must tell you though it were in the Church, I could not fart frankinsence. Wife But what said the God? Car. Just nothing. Wife. Is he so coursly bred? Car. Alas, he is not only a devourer of farts, but feeds Upon excrements, eats any thing. Wife. Thou wicked fellow. Car. After this was all past being in great fear of the God still, I hid my self, whilst with great gravity he administred to all the diseased according to their several necessities, his boy having brought him a little stone mortar, And a box of Instruments of Surgery. Wife. Was the box stone too? Car. Not the box stone. Wife. You lying fellow, you hid your self, and you You say you saw all. Car. Why, I saw all through the Priests gown which Wanted not loop holes I assure you: Now to end my story here the oynment was prepared For Neoclides; of the best garlick three cloves beaten In a morter as much squils this wet with vineger, And this he applied to Neoclides and to the end his torment Might be greater, he lifted up his eye lids, but he Stamping and roaring thought to run away, but Esculapius laughing, said, Sit still till I release you, To delay causes and betray Clients. Wife. What a lover of the Common-wealth this god is, And how wise. Car. Next to him he went to Plutus, and wiping first his Eyes, and covering his head and face, he gave a sign with A whisper, and out came two mighty Snakes. Wife. O monstrous! Car. These crept under the cloath to his Eyes, as I take it and licked them, and Mistris, before you Can drink half a dozen glasses of wine, Plutus arose up with His eye-sight perfect; I in the mean time clapped My hands for joy, and took my Master up in my arms, The God and the Serpents vanished into the Temple, And all that were about Plutus fell to imbrace him, And no man could sleep any longer for joy; I all the while magnified the God that had made Plutus see perfectly, and Neoclides quite blind. Wife. What a power this Esculapius hath, but where is Plutus? Car. He is coming this way with a number of honest People about him, that formerly lived very poorly, But now Mistris Plutus shakes them all by the hands, but Those that had got wealth unjustly he looks awry upon; But 'tis a wonder to see how he makes the old fools Leap and frisk before him that can hardly go; And now let us all dance for no man can now say to us Our Hogheads are empty of wine, or our Barns of corn. Wife. By Haccata I will crown thee too for thy news. Car. Well; dispatch quickly, for by this the company is At our Gates. Wife. I'le go home that these eyes of mine may see him. Car. And I with these leggs of mine will come Marching before them. [Ex. om.] Enter Plutus Cramulus and his Wife. Plu. First of all we salute the Sun and next this happy Soil of Pallas, together with all the land of Cereopis That hath thus kindly received me. It grieves us much to think of our former misery, And the ill company we have kept, and how we have Wandered up and down; but all this shall be amended And the world shall see it was much against my will To be kept in the hands of bad men. Crem. Out upon't, what creatures men are that are friends To a man only according to his success, every one I meet Now smiles on me, and my hands are almost shaked off: Who hath met me in the street to day without a complement? and all the old fools get about me and frisk. Wife. Right worthy man, blessing attend thee, and us all, According to our Countries custome I have brought A small banquet to refresh thee with. Plu. No sure, the first house I go with my eye sight into, Ought to receive from me, and not I from it. Wife. Will you despise our good will. Plu. Within by the fire side, when we are rid of this Rabbel of company, we shall have more leisure. Wife. Indeed you say well, for they had like to have had Me down for my Nuts and Apples but now. [Ex. om.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Carion Solus. Car. What a pleasure there is in living rich, especially to such as we that spend what we will; have still never the less left for it, fetch in nothing, but every thing runs in as it were of it self; our barns are full of corn, our Hogsheads full of wine, the jars full of oyle, pots full of Spicknard, and our purses full of mony, our rotten earthen Pots are now all silver, and the kitchin shines like Ivory. We servants now in stead of Counters play at even or odd with Gold, nor do we now wipe our tailes with Pibbles, but choice herbs most delightfully. The worst is, my Master yonder within with his golden crown On, is sacrificing a hog, a ram and a goat within, and There is such smoak and stink in the house, I was fain to Come crying out. Enter Justus his Boy and Carion. Just. Come child, follow me, and let us go to this God. Boy. VVho have we here making such hast towards us? Just. A man formerly miserable, but now happy. Car. He hath a good honest face. Just. Yes sure, and am that I seem. Car. VVell, what's thy business? Just. I would speak with your god a word or two, for I have received a great deal of good from him; I was left well by my Father, and supplied my friends In their necessities, and thought that they might be useful To me again in time of need. Car. And what you fell into want, I warrant presently. Just. Most certain, I did so. Car. How did you do then, I warrant you were miserably Used? Just. Ye hit it right; for I was strongly perswaded That they that had so liberally tasted of my kindness in My prosperity, would make some return when my turn Of suffering came, but they all looked awry upon me. Car. And laughed at thee I warrant. Just. They did so, when they saw me wither away. Car. They'l do so no more, I warrant thee now. Just. I am therefore come to thank Plutus for it. Car. But prethee, what is the reason thy Boy carries this Old torn Cloak after thee? Just. I come to consecrate this to the memory of Plutus. Car. 'Tis the Cloak I warrant thou wert first initiated In amongst the gods. Just. No, not so; but I have suffered cold in it this Thirteen years I am sure, Car. And what are these old shooes for? Just. Why, these are a year old too. Car. And so these are sacred too. Just. By Jupiter, I think so. Car. You'l bring him a brave gift. [Ex. om.] Enter Sycophantus, Carion and Justus. Syc. O miserable man that I am, thrice miserable, Nay, a hundred times over miserable! Car. O Apollo and the rest of ye, what doth this fellow aile? Syc. Why, I am undone in this one day, and have lost All, and all by this god of yours; but if there be any Law left, I'le have him made blind again as he was. Just. This is some knave I perceive opprest with ill Fortune for his ill manners. Car. Let him deservedly then perish like a thief as he is. Syc. Where is he that hath promised to make us all Equally rich in one day, upon condition he might have his Eyes again, and hath in doing so, made us ten times more Miserable then we were before, I'm sure some of us at least. Car. 'Tis because thou art a fool and a wicked fellow. Syc. None of you were counted wise I'm sure till you got mony. Car. How fierce this Sycophant is? his profession now will not get him bread, and that's it. Syc. You shall never scape me this day, I will have you Before the Justice, and hear you upon the wrack confess the horrible mischiefs you have done. Car. Alas, go and lament thy own condition. Just. And by Jove let Plutus be acknowledged of all Greece this day for throwing out all of your profession. Syc. O wretch that I am, what must I make you sport too? I pray you, where had you that new Cloak you have on? Yesterday, one thred-bare served your turn. Just. I fear thee not, I have got now a ring of Eudamus That I wear here as a charm against thee. Car. But yet against the biting of a Sycophant, I doubt Man hath no remedy of prevention. Syc. Are these scorns to be endured! what do you stay here for, for no good to any body I am sure? Car. Not to do you any good I am sure. Syc. No, but to live upon me, and sup to night of that Which should have been mine Just. O then thou wilt split with malice, for thou art Like now to have nothing else in thy guts. Syc. You say nothing, but all this while I smell a good Supper within of all manner of fish and flesh. Car. What's this he smels? Just. I believe 'tis rather hunger and cold that's coming Towards him, that he smels through the holes of his torn Cloak, then any thing else. Syc. Must I suffer all this reproach, O the gods! That an honest man and a lover of his Country should Be thus used. Just. You a lover of your Country? Syc. Yes, no man more. Just. Answer me then. Syc. Well. Just. Are you a husband-man? Syc. Do you think me mad to lead such a painful life? Just. Are you a Merchant then? Syc. I can counterfeit one, if need be. Just. Do you then profess any art? Syc. O Jove not I! Just. Which way dost thou live then, that hast nothing To do? Syc. Why, I take all business both publick and private Upon me. Just. Who entrusts you? Syc. Nay, 'tis my own pleasure. Just. Thou art alwayes medling where thou hast nothing To do, and art hated of all men: with what confidence Canst thou then profess thy self an honest man? Syc. Ye fool, do not I deserve well enough of the Common-wealth, think you, according to my place and Power? Just. Yes, if medling with other mens business, and having none of ones own, be a good quality. Syc. 'Tis every mans business to see the Lawes obeyed, and punish those that offend. Just. The City appoints Judges for that purpose. Syc. Yes, but who shall find them work? that is, bring in Offenders. Just. He that will for me, for 'tis an Office bed enough. Syc. Well, I am that man, and therefore judge if the whole business of the Common-wealth runs not through my hands. Just. This City had an evil instrument of thee; But wert not thou better live without this trouble, in peace? Syc. O no, 'tis a sheepish life to live without exercising our wits. Just. And wilt thou never change this mind? Syc. Not, if you will give me your Plutus that you have got, and Battus his Sylphium to boot. Just. Come, give me your Cloak. Car. Friend, he speaks to you. Just. And next your shooes. Car. Again he speaks to you. Syc. Will no body help me? Car. Yes, I am ready to help you off with them. Syc. I am undone. Car. See now what you get by medling with others Business is all so just lost again. Syc. Take heed what you do, I have witness here by How I am used. Car. Nay, your false witness have now forsaken you. Syc. Wo is me, if I am left alone to you too! Car. Now howl and roar, dost hear Justus? now give me thy old Cloak, and wee'l put it upon the Sycophants back. Just. That cannot be, man; I have, you know, consecrated it to Plutus. Car. By no means, 'twill become this fellow much better, and wee'l get a better Cloak for Plutus. Just. But what shall I do with my old shooes? Car. Wee'l hang those in his fore-head. Syc. Well, I see I must for the present be gone, for ye are too strong for me, but I'le return and be revenged upon you and your god, for altering the government of Mankind, thus without asking the Senate or the Towns advice. Just. Now you are got into my cloaths, run betimes, and get my place about the bath and keep you warm; It hath been my place this many years I am sure. Car. 'Tis his best if he can, but the Bath-keeper will quickly take hold of him and throw him out of dores, I warrant you, come let us in and salute our Plutus. [Ex. om.] Enter Old Woman, Chorus of Countrymen, and Cramulus. Wom. Good honest old Gentlemen, tell me if this be the way to the new god they talk of. Chor. Ye are now come to the very house, good young Gentlewoman. Wom. May I be so bold to call to speak with some of the House? Cram. That's needless, for I am going in; but what's your business? Wom. I am under a great deal of misery, and have been so ever since this god first began to have his sight again. Cram. What's the matter, sure this is something amongst the women, that the Sycophant is amongst men and of the same calling. Wom. Alas not I! Cram. Then thou art some she drunkard. Wom. You jest with my afflictions, and that's worst of all. I am withered away with love. Cram. Prethee who hath withered thee? Wom. You must know, there was a young fellow with an honest good face, but poor, yet the truth is he gave me what I wanted, and I supplied him with his necessities. Cram. What were they? Wom. Why, truely he was not very importunate, only sometimes he wanted mony to buy him a Cloak, and sometimes a pair of Shooes, and sometimes his Sister and his Mother wanted cloaths, and sometimes bread. Cram. Call you this nothing, this was love indeed. Wom. Yes indeed, for he said he asked these things not for their value, but as they were mine, and so wore my very shooes for my sake, and to put him in mind of me. Cram. This was a wonderful lover. Wom. But now alas, his love is quite vanished, for but now I sent him Cheescakes, and bad the messenger tell him I would see him to night. Cram. And what said he, prethee? Wom. Truly, he sent me my Cheescakes again, and bid me be sure never to come to him more, and withal added this proverb, that once the Milesis indeed were Powerful. Cram. A crafty fellow, he scorns ordinary fair now, but would have devoured any thing when he was poor. Wom. And yet heretofore this man would be at my Chamber dore every day. Cram. To see what he could steal, I warrant. Wom. No, he swore it was onely to here my voice. Cram. By which he thought to hear some gift was coming. Wom. And when he saw me sad, he would call me his Minion, his Deer. Cram. This was when he had got thy shooes on, I warrant. Wom. And at Ceres feast, when we were in the coach together, if any body did but give me a look, I was beaten for it all day, so jealous he was of me. Cram. He would have no body enjoy your goods but he. Wom. He would tell me I had such fine white hands. Cram. When they were reaching him out mony. Wom. He said my skin naturally smelt sweet. Cram. Then thou hadst some trick to sweat wine. Wom. He said I had lovely eyes. Cram. This fellow is no fool, he knows how to stir up an Old womans lust, this was the right food to it. Wom. Now gentlemen consider, whether your god, do not do unjustly, to see a poor woman under these afflictions, and not help her. Cram Say what thou wouldest have him do, and wee'l send for him. Wom. 'Tis just that he should make this young fellow deserve as well of me, as I have done of him. Cram. Why, he pays thee all at night still I hope. Wom. Alas, he promis'd whilst he lived he would never forsake me. Cram. He hath kept his word, for I warrant he doth not believe thou art now fit to be called a living creature. Wom. Indeed I am wasted with sorrow. Cram. Or rather dryed up with it and shrunk. Wom. You may draw me through a ring. Cram. That ring must be as big as the hoop of a Sive. Wom. See yonder he comes of whom I complain thus, Hee's going to some feast I warrant. Cram. It seems so, for he is very fine. Enter Young-man. Young. Save ye Gentlemen. Cram. Let's here what he will say. Young. O Mistris mine! how suddenly are you altered? Grown gray I protest, since I saw you. Wom. O miserable woman that I am, how I am abused! Cram. What, is it such a long time since he saw you? Wom. How long think you? he was with me but yesterday. Cram. Then this man differs from all others, for the More drunk he is, the quicker his senses are. Wom. O no, this is of late his usual humour. Young O Neptune, what waves, what wrinkles hast thou got in thy forehead! Wom. Prethee do not bring the light so near. Cram. She says well, for if one spark should chance to fall upon thee, thou wouldst burn and crack like a piece of an Olive tree. Young. How sayest, wilt thou have about with me? Wom. Where thou foolish fellow. Young. Here. Wom. At what game? Young. At even or odd, how many teeth hast in thy head? Cram. I can devine that, not above three or four, I warrant you. Young. Still thou art able to crack nuts, for a Mill hath but one tooth. Wom. You are uncivil thus to empty all your villany and ill language upon me thus. Young. You must get some body to make you clean again then. Cram. O wash her not by any means, for if her paint were washed off, we should see a face would fright us. Wom. For a man of your age you seem not to be very wise methinks. Young. He hath been tempting thee, and playing with thee I believe, and thou findest he is old and can do nothing and so thou despisest him. Wom. By Venus! never touched me, thou wicked fellow. Cram. No no, I were mad to offer it, that were to make a Quarrel between you and your Mistris. Young. Alas, I defie you for that, I love her so it's impossible. Cram. She accuses you though. Young. Me, of what? Cram. Of all manner of reproaches, and that you hit her in the teeth with that proverb, that once the Milessi were strong. Young. Well, you strive to win my girle from me, I see, But I will not contend with you for her. Cram You slight her, I see. Young. No, I reverence her age, or else no man should carry her from me, and so I give you joy Sir, and farewell. Cram. He's weary of her company. Wom. And yet who is fitter for it then I am? Young. I'le change no more words with such an old divel, that hath been a whore this ten thousand years. Cram. Yes, but as they say, now you have drunk the wine, methinks you should be content with the lees. Young. Yes, but this lees is fowler and more corrupted then ordinary. Cram. What remedy? Young. We'l try, I am going in to sacrifice to Plutus. Wom. I have a word or two to say to him too. Young. Nay, then I'le not go in. Gram. Have a good heart man, she cannot ravish thee. Young. No, I have tam'd her pretty well. Wom. Go when you will, I'le follow you step by step. Cram. O Jupiter! how this old woman sticks to him Like an Oyster to a stone. [Ex. om.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scene 1. Enter Carion and Mercury. Car. Who is this that makes such a noise and knocking at dore, I can see no body neither, sure the dores do not make this noise themselves. Mer. Stay Carion, I say I must speak with you. Car. O! is it you that have made all this stir? Mer. I could have come in whither you had opened the dores or no; go take your heels and run and call your Master and your Mistris hither presently, and all the Servants, nay the very dog and the hog too. Car. What's the matter? Mer. Jupiter hath given command you should be all tied together and thrown into the Dungeon. Car. A blister upon thy tongue for this news, why does Jupiter threaten us so horribly? Mer. You have committed the greatest of all wickedness; For since Plutus began to see, men have quite left to offer frankinsence, lawrel, bread, flesh, or indeed any kind of Sacrifice. Car. Nor never shall any more by my consent, for before this day you never made any provision for us, or gave us a word of true Counsel. Mer. I know not what the rest of the gods will do, but for my part I am sure I am almost starved. Car. Why, now you will begin to grow wise, and know the world. Mer. Heretofore, so soon as I was up in a morning all the bawds and whores used to bring me presents of all manner of good things, nothing was too good for Mercury, and now I am so ill maintained I can scarce go upon my legs. Car. Ye are right enough served, for returning evil still to those that you have received good from. Mer. Alas! what is now become of all those custards that used to be made against my feast. Car. 'Tis in vain to let your mouth water at those things now they are gone and past. Mer. O the troops of Victimes that used to be brought to my Altars! Car. Now how will you do to dance upon the skins full of wine with one leg. Mer. O the warm bowels and entrails I used to devour heretofore. Car. You have a pain in your own guts to think on it. Mer. What pleasantly compounded draughts I have had. Car. If thou shouldest taste once again of them, we should never be rid of thee. Mer. Stand my friend then, and help me, I am one that loves thee. Car. If I knew how, I would. Mer. Help me but to a little of that victuals that you are sacrificing within to Plutus in such abundance. Car. I dare not carry any thing out of the house. Mer. If you steal a little out of your Masters cup their's no hurt, I'le cast a cloud over you, that no body shall see you. Car. You have been used ye villain I see to pardon and conceal the theft of all those that would sacrifice half of it when they had done to you, this trick hath got you all you have. Mer. Is not that fair to devide? Car. Yes, but you would be loth to take part of the blowes I shall have for stealing it; if I am taken playing the thief there, you all leave us. Mer. O do not torment me thus! now you are hapy your self, you should rather help me to some place in the house amongst you. Car. What, would you leave the gods for such company as ours? Mer. Yes, for 'tis much a happier being. Car. But to run away from them and your Country methinks is not so handsome. Mer. That's a mans Country where he can live happilest. Car. But prethee if thou wert amongst us, what good couldst thou do, what office wouldst undertake? Mer. Any thing, I would be porter to look to the gates. Car. We need not keep any body out now, they that have plenty, bid all wellcome. Mer. Make me a Merchant then. Car. VVe need not trade, nor soul our fingers with mony, we have all we wish, Mercury is no mineral we stand in Need of now. Mer. Do you want a subtile man to manage your affairs? Car. VVe have no need of craft neither, But rather of Candide people. Mer. Do you not then need a guide in difficult matters? Car. VVhy, you forget your self, Plutus sees again now. Mer. Let me then be the inventer of your Playes and Musicks, how say you to that? Plutus I am sure VVill have need of those delights. Car. On the contrary rather there will be no need of Mens studying such arts now, for they are invented to get bread, and a living out off; Though our great men now adayes affect such things to get themselves a name for science and virtue. Mer. Is there no way for me to be brought into the House then? Car. Yes, now the Sacrifices are past, if you will go to the well and draw water, you shall have the washing of the Tripes; but see then you be wondrous diligent. [Ex. om.] Enter Joves Priest and Carion. Priest. VVho can tell me where Cremulus lives? Carion. Now friend, what's the matter? Pr. Friend said you, in good time, you'r my friend indeed to get Plutus his eyes again, and now I am ready to starve, though I am one of Joves own Priests. Car. VVhy, what's the matter? Pr. VVhy, every body now is got rich, and grown idle, and no body now comes with a sacrifice for good success in his journey, nor that he may cast his enemy at law: VVe may lock up our dores, Jove will have no more sacrifices, nor no body comes as I see, except whole troops that come to shit at the dores, that they'l come out of their way for. Car. VVhy, then all they leave there falls to your flare by your place. Pr. Nay, I have taken my leave of Jupiter, and mean to come and live here. Car. Take courage, man, all will be well again I warrant you; for your Jupiter, your Saviour, or at least that you mean and worship, is in this house, I'le assure you. Pr. That's good news. Car. Stay a little, and you shall see wee'l put Plutus in Jupiters Throne, and do you light the torches and you shall go before him, just as you did the tother, and all will be well. Pr. This I think very fit to be done. Car. VVe'l in, and call him out to the Temple. [Ex. om.] Enter Old Woman, Carion, and Chorus. Wom. VVhat shall I do? Car. Do? why, carry these pots upon your head, and go carefully with them, and set them upon the Altars ready against Plutus comes to the sacrifice, and make your self as fine as you can. Wom. But what becomes of the business I came here about. Car. Come come, all shall be according to thy mind, And the young fellow shall be with thee again at night. Wom. If you will promise me that, I will do any thing. Car. Other pots use to have their scum upon the top, But these as they stand upon her gray head look as If they had their scum at the bottome. Chor. All is now done, there onely remains now that's follow therest of the company singing &amp; dancing. [Ex. om.] FINIS.</field>
