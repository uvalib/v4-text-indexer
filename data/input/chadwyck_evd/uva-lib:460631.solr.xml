      <field name="fulltext">ANTHONY BABINGTON A DRAMA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">âMy prime of youth is but a frost of cares, My feast of joy is but a dish of pain, My crop of corn is but a field of tares, And all my goodes is but vain hope of gain. The day is fled, and yet I saw no sun, And now I live, and now my life is done! âMy spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung, The fruit is dead and yet the leaves are green, My youth is past, and yet I am but young, I saw the world and yet I was not seen; My thread is cut and yet it is not spun, And now I live, and now my life is done!â (Verses made by Chidiock Titchborne of himselfe in the Tower the night before he suffered death, who was executed for treason, 1586.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Anthony Babington (a Catholic Gentleman of Derbyshire). Queen Elizabeth. Mary Queen of Scots. Sir William Cecil (Lord Burghley, Lord Treasurer).

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âAn inner room at the tavern of the âThree Tuns,â in Newgate Market; Anthony Babington, seated at a table, shrouded in a cloak and disguised as an old man, with false beard, surrounded by nine of his Fellow-conspirators. John Ballard, also disguised, and under the name of âCaptain Fortescue.â Peter Barton, a servant of Babington's. Tankards, flagons, and remains of a supper. Ballard. We must call for another flagon of wine, so that they deem we meet here only to drink. [Calls for wine, which is brought.] Are we all assembled? Babington. One is wanting, but he will be here anon. Ballard. See that the doors are locked [doors secured] while I read over the names of those present. Anthony Babington, of Dethwick (under God the prime mover in this good cause), John Charnock, Edward Windsor, Thomas Salisbury, Robert Barnwell, Thomas Gerrard, John Savage, Charles Tilney, Henry Donn, and myself, John Ballard, a priest of the most holy Order of Jesus; but who will be known and addressed this evening as Captain Fortescue, a soldier of fortune. Conspirators. We are all here, save Mr. Chidiock Titchborne, of South Hants, whom we are momentarily expecting. Ballard. Now I would have you all to say once more that ye be agreed in this undertaking, which is for the ultimate good of all Christendom; for though you have each one partaken of the blessed sacrament, swearing thereon to be united together to this end, I would have him that fears for his life to withdraw from the midst of us, lest his ensample should cause others to falter. Conspirators. We are all agreed. Ballard. Then we may hope for great things. Ye have heard how the Holy Father, Christ's vicar on earth, hath graciously extended unto him that shall be the chosen instrument of God, his absolution and his blessing; seeing that in ridding the world of the Beast, great glory must needs accrue to the one true faith? Conspirators. We have heard the gracious message of his Holiness. Ballard. You, John Savage, have good reason to rejoice, in that you have been specially singled out and predestined of heaven to accomplish this great work. Sometime a soldier under his most catholic highness the Prince of Parma, may you find yourself ere long enrolled amongst the glorious army of Christ's saints, in whose service if so be that you endure martyrdom, all the more will you be assured of your eternal reward. John Savage. Amen! Ballard. Yet it is an old saying, and one to be reverenced, that two heads are better than one; and so with the hands that are to strikeâthey should be ready on all sidesâlet them but bide their time. For we should not let the weight of so mighty an undertaking depend alone on the finite prowess of one man. You, Robert Barnwell, in that you are an inmate at this present of the Court, and Charles Tilney, seeing that you are one of the pensioners of the heretic queen (whom we speak of as the Beast that doth trouble Christendom), and therefore one of those last to be suspected, you will have access in many ways to the royal presence, denied to others amongst us, who would, nevertheless, rejoice at the same chance, whereof see that ye profit, and that ye strike home. Conspirators. We bide our time. Ballard. This is the way we hope to work for God. Firstly, we propose to remove the Beast that troubles the earth; and when this great good is achieved, then shall we strike at the hearts of all those her evil counsellors who have confirmed and strengthened her in her evil course. Cecil, Walsingham, Francis Knollys, and Hunsdonâthese are the names of those to be doomed and damned. May their deaths serve as a warning to all such as militate against Christ's kingdom on earth. Conspirators. Amen! Ballard. Once again, have ye given up, all of you, the safest and surest way of dealing with her whose living is a curse? I have in my mind her removal by poison, to be administered in her food by those of her creatures whom we may convert for the glory of God. Babington. As English gentlemen, this is an idea not to be entertained by us. Ballard. I spoke of it but as a method which would not be fraught with the same dangers that must needs now lurk in your path; the tortures inflicted on the blessed Balthasar Gerard, the instrument of heaven who so bravely freed the world of the heretic Prince of Orange, affright you not? Babington. What a French lad, base born, could dare and endure, are we, who are Englishmen, to shrink from? Ballard. Then we are all agreed? Babington. Mr. Titchborne is for some safe middle course. He hath said to me more than once of this project: âSo it involved not the killing of a woman, and she my queen, I would join to you with the more zeal.â Ballard. He that is minded to croak, or to clap a wet clout on our endeavours, let him cry off. [Knock at door. Landlord. A gentleman of your party who has been delayed. [Enter Chidiock Titchborne.] Titchborne. Good evening, friends. A cold March after our green Yule. Babington. âA green Yule makes a full kirkyard,â as the Scots say. Titchborne. It was heavy travelling over the Hampshire moors. But our farmers say of the cold, Better now than later. Ballard. God prosper the harvest. [Exit Landlord.] But he is departed now, so a truce to the weather and the crops. Though, now I bethink me, your greeting, Babington, would not make a bad password, for a time at least; though we must change it to another ere long, for safety. It were well that those gentlemen who are joined together in this great cause should have some string of words by the introducing of which into their careless talk they may make known which way lie their sympathies; for each day the circle of those who work for the glory of God will wax larger, and there may be those amongst us in a week who to-day know not where to turn for comfort. Let it be told to our friends that with this greeting they may be sure of a welcome: âA green Yule maketh a full kirkyard,â in some method interpolated into their talk; and lest it should be said lightly and by accident by those who are ignorant of its significance, let them afterwards say, in carelesswise, âGod prosper the harvest.â You have made a note of this, gentlemen? Conspirators. We have. Peter Barton. I am no scholar; would one of these gentlemen write the words? [Babington writes. Ballard (to Titchborne). And now, sir, how comes this, and you a Catholic gentleman, one of the good old stock? How so luke-minded? For I hear that you shrink from what must needs be our crowning good. There is an apathy as damnable 'fore God as evil deeds. Buckle yourself for action! Babington. Bear with him, father, he is with us privily; but, like myself, he hath a wife. He plays a game of hazard most disastrous if he lose. Her heart breaks with his neck. Ballard (aside). Hush, Babington! your words unnerve him. And of your own wife, how often have you said that she stood not in your way? Titchborne. It is as you say. I wish you well. Yet well I also wish others had worked for thisânot my true friends. See, too, your idol be not made of clayâ the lady of your dreams. I say no more, fearing to anger you; but since seeing you I have had more proof of the truth of those grievous reportsâthe rumours of her evil living heretofore. Ballard. There is no purity that can withstand Obliquity of vision. As I watch'd From this gray square of window, waiting you, Before the daylight vanish'd, I beheld The very snowflakes, on their earthward side, Look black against the whiter space of sky, Yet were they very part of that same world Of unshed purity. Be generous, You do not know her; your material eyes See but the under-shadow cast by earth Upon the falling snowflakes. Titchborne. Yet, my friends, Be ye not trick'd by vain ambitions. Anthony, There are good things besides the love of fame And smiles of princes. I am not long wed To one who makes the world seem emptiness And home a world of blessings. Politics Involve in these our days such tortuous Deceptions, such false dealings, all for ends So fork'd and complicated, budding forth In doubtful double-blossomâFrance and Spain, Poor Ireland, where the ragged rightful lords Wait, like a grisly pack of famish'd wolves, To spring on their oppressors. Add to this, Cold Scotland, too, and Flanders; 'tis a match Flung in a mine of powder, this same plot To crown the Scottish Mary. Mark my words! The queen is such a weathercock to turn That what she wills to-day is but a sign She change her mood to-morrow; she may yet Name Mary Stuart her heir. And one thing moreâ I would that ye could keep from deed of bloodâ You guess my thoughtâthink of it, Anthonyâ A woman and your queen! Why, at the worst Let but the queens change places; for the one, Three crowns and all the people at her feet (If she act wisely); whilst Elizabeth Languish in lone captivity. The Tower, If God so wills it. Nay, the very block Hath pillow'd many heads of our true faith Whilst we walk'd young and lusty! E'en the block, If Heaven so wills, not the assassin's knife. Ballard (ironically). Were it not better at once to withdraw your name and countenance from so dangerous an enterprise? Let us first think of our own heads, and when they are sure 'twill be time enow to work for the kingdom of Christ. Oh England, England! How art thou changed, and thy one-time flower of chivalry, since thou groanest under a heretic prince! Titchborne. Sir, I have no words for one who calls me coward from under a priest's habit. I cannot strike, so I am dumb. Farewell, my friends, I have to journey to-morrow into South Hants, and I must be a-bed betimes. Babington (producing pencil and paper). First, I must have the turn of your head, the cut of your beard, and the tip of your pearl earring [sketching hastily]. Thusâmy picture is well-nigh completed, and our queen will now have a sure way of knowing our faces. She need no longer think of us as a pack of featureless churls. See, a goodly company! Will her grace recognise amongst them the smooth-faced boy who was her page at Sheffield grown to man's estate? Folks say I am but little changed, save in my stature. [Passing the sketch to Titchborne. Titchborne. A pretty fancy. I recognise you as our head in the centre. But have you any safe way of conveying this to her Majesty? Babington. A way most sure and safe. Heaven is certainly with us. [Drawing. Titchborne. Should these hurried lines not suffice for thee, we might complete the work in Hampshire, whither, as I have said, I go to-morrow, and where I should be proud to be host to you, Anthony. There are many things on which I would converse at mine ease. Babington. The picture must be despatched at once, whilst this sure method is open to us; but if you will not journey too early in the day, I shall most gratefully avail myself of your hospitality. I myself am bound, ere long, to journey towards your Hampshire. Titchborne. Then we journey together. To-morrow we will communicate. Once more, good evening, gentlemen. [Exit. Babington (to Ballard). Nay, he is as brave as our bravest. It is not for his own neck he fears; he hath a wife and child. Ballard. Whom you did wrong, Babington, to recall at such a moment to his mind. The woman hath doubtless been working upon him. Oh, I know these women-folk! They have blasted the soul of many an honest man. But let us turn from the ominous gruntings of this Hampshire hogâlet him wallow in his Southampton mire. Babington. As gallant a gentleman as ever stepped. Ballard. Marriage may have marred him; and yet Brutus was no bachelor! But now to what is nearest our hearts. Babington. That is our queen's letter. It hath been nearest to mine for the week. See! its edges fray already and threaten my lady's sweet words. [Kisses the letter. Ballard. When to the love of woman is join'd the love of God, the true faith, and the good of all Christendom, love on. But ere we band together in this greatest cause, each of you is bound, I hold, to forswear the love of all such sweethearts and courtesans as mar the dreams of young men. You should all swear this on God's word. Oh! I have known womenâbut I would have you to know that it is possible for our divine love towards the blessed Mother of God so to incorporate itself and become incarnate, even in the fleshly nature of man, to the utter casting out of baser desires. Babington (thoughtfully). Even soâeven soâI begin to credit your words. My soul seems at length attuning itself to this grand mystery, and, my earthly queen acting as mediator, I doubt not I may hope to climb from her love to that of her blessed namesake the queen of heaven. Ballard. That is as it should be. So a young man fix his eyes on heaven, I blame him not if he remember some of the stars were women. But let us now drink to the extinction of such lesser lights as must lead to damnation. Here's to the steeling of our hearts 'gainst all those that were wont to soften them! We want our hearts, gentlemen. [Drinks. Conspirators. Aye, and our heads! [All drink, passing the flagon. Babington hesitates. Voice of Alice (heard without). I have word of a gentleman being here, with whom I would speak. Can you show me to his presence, good sir? Landlord. How, think you, fair mistress, should I know your gentleman from the fourscore or so that frequent us nightly? How may I know your gentleman? Alice. He is a young gentleman of noble carriage, I have heard say there is not one like himâno, not in all England. Landlord. Ah! I'll be bound a very paragon of beauty! You must make a pretty couple. But how tall is your gentleman? Alice. He would stoop at your door, yonder, through which I have been privily informed he passed an hour ago. May I speak with him? Landlord. There was an old man, gray-bearded and cloak'd, who stooped at my door. I noted him as straight and tall for his years, though he walk'd with a stick. Alice (suspecting). Ah! that is, belike, his father. Is he within there? Landlord. He is carousing with some dozen of his boon companions; were I a young gentlewoman, I would keep clear of them. Alice. His gray hairs will protect me. May I enter? [Knocks. Ballard. Who knocks? Alice. I would speak with one of you gentlemen. Babington (aside). Alice! Ballard (unlocking door). Your gentleman is not amongst us, my good girl, but satisfy yourself. Alice (after scanning each face attentively). To any of you doth the name of âAlice,â Of one sweet moonlight night, of an old house In Dorsetshire, amidst its flat park landsâ Crow-crested elm-trees clust'ring round its wingsâ Of a dim chamber wainscoted with books, Of an old woman reading from God's word With Luther's mind, as sanction'd by King Harry, Of a young maiden kneeling at her feet, And list'ning to her words: to none of you Twelve present gentlemen, do all these things Seem to mean anything? Conspirators. To none of us! Alice. Alas! to none of you? Then can my heart Have so deceiv'd me? [Aside] Nay, he must be here! Think, gentlemen, again, I pray of youâ The name of Alice? Ballard. Hark you, Alice, thenâ So that you rest as pure as when you came, Take yourself hence, this is no place for you. These gentlemen are somewhat gone in wine. So that they deem you not some fly-by-night, Go, get you hence! [Rises. Alice. Sir, all these gentlemen Seem sober as yourself. I fear them not, Knowing he is amongst them. Ballard (angrily). Out, girl, out! Alice. Yet if he knows not me, maybe he knows This ringâhis coat of arms. Not long agoâ Ballard. This passes patience! Here, mine host! Since when hath your house so lost its good name, that barefaced courtesans may come and molest honest gentlemen as they sup? Out with this brazen wench! [Endeavours to thrust Alice towards the door. Babington rises up to defend her, and in so doing, his disguise falls from him. Alice (recognising him). Anthony! [Clings to him for protection, whilst Babington makes a gesture to keep off the rest. Scene II. âAn anteroom at Court. Two Courtiers in conversation. Evening. 1st Gentleman. Good ev'ning, sir; you do not wear a mask? 2nd Gentleman. I only wait to speak with Mr. Walsingham. I am not of the company to-night. 1st Gentleman. Then let us wait here, in this anteroom, Whence he and all the other notables Must pass towards the presence. 2nd Gentleman. He will pass, Knowing I wait him. He confides to me, To-night, a letter to Lord Shrewsbury, Touching the Queen of Scots. I start to-morrow Upon an embassage to Tutbury, Bearing his papers. 1st Gentleman. What think you of Shrewsbury? 2nd Gentleman. True as tried steelâall Papist tho' he be. He is too near this queen to see in her Aught save the painted Jezebel she is. He sickens of her whimsâas well he mayâ Seeing a woman one day make her bath Of good veal broth amidst the starving poor, And then of wine. Why, waste is not the word! And all to smooth her wrinkles, so they say, And thus inflame the hearts of foolish boys, Who die for her ere they have seen the face She smooths for them! 1st Gentleman. Nor will they ever see it. Nor her head crown'd as they would have it crown'd; She smooths it for the headsman. Mark my words! 2nd Gentleman. Well, so she must coquette, no matter how; It may as well be with the headsman's axe, For that will kiss her close for good and all. 1st Gentleman. Hush! she may still reign over us. 2nd Gentleman. Ah well, If so (we live in times of change, good sooth!) I'll never see her wrinkles, and if needs, I'll kiss her all as closely as the axe. We live in times of change. [Whistles. 1st Gentleman. Yet God is mercifulâmost merciful! This is for some good end. 'Tis often thus. I, in mine own short life, an hundred times Have seen how Satan's Babel Tow'r of cards Fell as he rais'd the topmost card. 2nd Gentleman. A queen? 1st Gentleman. Ha, ha! A queen or knave, or sometimes both. 2nd Gentleman. God raises kings; these queens are of the devilâ They have such whims and such infirmities. 1st Gentleman. Hush, hush! thou knowest they are none the less The Lord's anointed. All things have a purpose; And e'en a scourge may guide us the right way. 2nd Gentleman. I am awearied of these wholesome scourges. If the Lord's mercy would but grant we went Right of ourselves! I hold with none of this. 1st Gentleman. I hold with it just now for my head's sake. Once off, this head of mine will gabble treason And blasphemies enow, I warrant you. I feel my lips will not keep ever silent; But till the day that I am cleft asunder I am a Protestant and queen's good courtier. 2nd Gentleman. Methought anon you were for all these things, Being foreshadow'd in the Word of God? 1st Gentleman. Another time I will expound to you The contradictions that there seem in me. Not now, not now; these very walls have ears, And might betray my idle words. But hush! Here comes the topmost card in Satan's pack. [Enter the Earl of Leicester, dressed in magnificent costume.] 2nd Gentleman. Good night, my lord. It were vain to ask how the world fares with one of so pleasant a countenance. Leicester. Thanks, my good friend. I am as well as a man may be in troublous timesâhis brain so harassed by the State's complexion that he hath no time to mark that of his own face. Happy that only a few thus sweat for the million. 1st Gentleman. My lord is the very Atlas of our State. This is well knownâthe masses speak of it. Leicester. Nay, then, they are not so dunder-headed as I deemed. Her Grace is at the helm. I watch the stars. 1st Gentleman (aside). Were I a fiery star whose writhing tail must switch the earth, he would not watch me long for lack of eyes. 2nd Gentleman (aside). Report saith he knows as little of the real state of the realm as may be with one so pampered, and that her grace will show him rather the colour of her garters than that of her mind. Leicester. Good ev'ning, sirs. I pass into the presence. 1st and 2nd Gentlemen. Your servants, good my lord. [Exit Leicester. [Enter Sir F. Walsingham.] Walsingham (giving paper to 2nd Gentleman). Here is the letter Of which I spoke; give it my lord of Shrewsbury, With loving greeting. Rest not by the road, And bring his answer to me presently. Saddle to-morrow early, and be sure You take the safest way. 2nd Gentleman. Your servant, sir; I do as you desire me, and depart To make me ready. [Exeunt the two Gentlemen. [Enter Cecil.] Cecil. Ah! good ev'ning, Walsingham! Walsingham. Hast heard these papist cries of exultation That echo thro' the land? Cecil. To me the cries Of tinkling cymbal. Mark me, blatant brass. Walsingham. Hast heard their threats directed 'gainst the life Of the queen's highness? Cecil. Measured to a cry! Mark me, cried only to excite the masses To some untoward act, reactionary Against the Catholics; who henceforth, wrong'd (As they will prove), will wear a martyr's mien And spur their partisans to contumacy. Such seem to me to mean these late reports Floating around usâidle, aimless threats, Made for a purpose. Walsingham. Yet it might be well To fence her highness, were it but to prove My thought the more unmeaning; for to me These seem less idle threats than warning words, Flung e'en to warn Her Highness. Making sure To spill her blood, it even seems to me Their hearts wax pitiful, and counting her E'en as the hang'd who walks to meet his death, They make a truce of hatred, for the queen Feeling that full forgiveness men may feel Towards one doomed to die, e'en if in life He crossed their purpose. Cecil. I am with you there, To fence Her Highness from all shadow of harm. But she is hard to fence. Such iron courage Mix'd often with such flippancy of mood, I marvel at the medley. Walsingham. Ah, forsooth Her Highness is a woman. Cecil. Aye, indeed, The very veriest woman in the land! [Exit Cecil. Walsingham (musing). I had a mind to tell him of my plot To counterplot these plotters. Yet maybe 'Tis yet o'er soon, each moment makes more ripe. Yet, as I wait, the queen's most precious life May be in jeopardy. See, here they stand. [Opens paper with the picture by Babington. Curse you for traitors! Yes, I see his face Whom but an hour from now I saw abide A bow-shot from her! Who may say the names Of those whose faces start not, like his own, To my remembrance? Ah, he comes this way. Now to dissemble! [Enter Robert Barnwell.] Barnwell. Ah, good ev'ning, sir! A splendid entertainment, well conceived. In my poor country such high junketing, With so great hospitality, withal So merrily attuned, had bred, with time, A spirit far more loyal than exists In that misguided land towards the queen. Such bravery makes Irish loyalty. Walsingham. Is Irish loyalty in aught allied To loyalty in England? Barnwell. It is said An Irish heart, newly awakening To loyalty, love, honour, duty, hate, Or vengeance, stays at nothing. Walsingham. So, indeed! But they avenge, at times, e'en benefits With thrust of knife or blow of knotted club In that your Ireland. Barnwell (lightly). There be caitiffs, sir, And knavesâborn knavesâin all lands o' the earth. They lurk in court and camp, and not alone 'Midst my gray mist-capp'd mountainsâthis is truth. Your servant, sir, good ev'ning! Walsingham (aside). Ah, too true! âThey lurk in court and campâand this is truth.â [Aloud] Your servant, sir, good ev'ning! [Aside] Ah, I would I could unmask the traitor! Yet at present My one thought is to let her highness know Her near destruction, meditated e'en By those she fear'd the least. I hear the strains Of merry-making music. Now to show My fears less idle than she deem'd. God grant I find her highness predisposed to list To my entreaties. [Exit Walsingham. [Enter Edward Windsor.] Barnwell. Well, my brother-in-arms! Windsor. How goes the cause? No need to say to you Our watchword of green Yule and harvest time, And yet, God speed the harvest! Barnwell. So say I. And yet there doth appear to hang some charm About her life. I was as near to her To-day as now you standâthe wherewithal To do the deed I held tight in my graspâ When, lo! I met her eye; it made me quail. She is King Harry's daughter. Windsor. Some do say She was but father'd on him. Barnwell. Nay, I knew One who, in liquor, used to say he knew The late King Henry, and I feel assured This queen proceeds from him. A royal temperâ A real right royal temper. Windsor. You, indeed, Seem not to breathe in vain the air of courtsâ You know to flatter even while you stab. Barnwell. Yes, we have flattered her grace. We have fawned upon her, and come near to stabbing her with a knife; we have called her a lily and a rose; her two buck teeth have been call'd pearls, and her hair gold. Windsor. I have christened her a very queen of quicksilverâ there is none can change like the queen. But stay âby the sound of the music methinks she hath enter'd the ball-room. I wish you well, and success to your undertaking. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Ball-room at Courtâmasks, mummers, musicians, &amp;c. Cecil, Walsingham, Leicester. Queen Elizabeth on the arm of Sir Christopher Hatton. Elizabeth (perceiving Walsingham and Cecil, who wish to obtain a hearing). Well, Mr. Timidity, what now? You and Mr. Propriety have been dogging our footsteps for the night. One of you hath had, doubtless, in view care of my life, t' other of my honour. Oh, I know; I will not be gainsaid. So far so good. It hath been said of us, however, that we have the mind of a man, though housed in these poor rags of womanhood. Of some who live in trunk-hose we have heard said they had the souls of women. We will not say that you two gentlemen are thus chicken-livered. First we will answer those who would have care for our life. Are we, or are we not, the daughter of King Harry? Cecil (bluntly). Your majesty has always been accounted his daughter, and of late years his daughter born in wedlock. Elizabeth. Answered as though cum grano salis. Well, then, we have been accounted the daughter of King Harry by those who by their language would fain we had been another's, so it were not their own. Ergo, we are the daughter of King Henry. What say you, my lord of Leicester? Nay, by that cuff on his addled pate he knows us for the daughter of King Harry! [Cuffs him.] Leicester. Your majesty is the daughter of King Harry. Elizabeth (continuing). Then do I fear for my life, gentlemen? I shall answer, Did my royal father fear harm of any amongst those that wished him ill? Did he fear the Pope, or Antichrist, or all the combined powers of Europe? Neither do I fear them. Let them do their worst. Vex not yourselves for meânay, 'tis maybe but of small account. [Weeps. Sir C. Hatton. Nay, madam. [Kissing her hand. Elizabeth (sharply). Nay, sir; we are King Harry's daughter. [Boxes his ears. Sir C. Hatton (holding his hand to his head). Her grace hath strange moodsâa very woman, a very woman! Elizabeth. S'death, man! What do we hear you muttering below breath? âA very woman! a very woman!â Out, man! We are no woman! It hath been said of us that we had the mind of a man. Leicester. Her highness's varying moods recall alternately the smiles of Venus and the thunders of Jove. Elizabeth (smiling). Strange! that hath been said of us before. But now for the second clause of our argument. As regardeth our honour, are we, or are we not a virgin queen? Walsingham. Your grace having presently signified that you were not a woman, it is difficult so to reconcile your declarations as to give satisfaction to your highness; thus I can but make answer that your highness hath ever been accounted a virgin. Elizabeth. Zounds! Answered again as with a grain of salt. Since when such contumacy? Sir C. Hatton. Your majesty is the daughter of King Harry, and a man and a virgin. Walsingham (aside). Cum grano salis. Elizabeth. Then what fears have ye, mine honest well-wishers, for for my life or honour? Walsingham. Dear madam, could I ask a moment's truce to this light mood. I have that to speak about to sadden your highness. I grieve to trespass on time meant for merrymaking, but I am left no choice. Might I have audience of your highness alone? Elizabeth. We will pass towards the anteroom. But, good Walsingham, be not long-winded. [They proceed towards the corner of the apartment. Nay, before you speak I know what you would sayâanother Popish plot? Nay? What then? [Snatching at the paper with the picture by Babington.] Ha! who are these pretty young gentlemen? One, two, three, four, five, sixâtwelve of them. Walsingham (sadly). Madam, such levity doth ill beseem One seated so above us, on a throne Still insecure and threaten'd. Let the child Trample the daisy-wreath he calls a crown, Or split the sceptre that was once a reed. Your highness plays with nations' destinies, And should consider. Precious is the life Of a high princess to her faithful few; But precious, too, that life to Protestants Who war with Antichrist, and to the realmâ An orphan, madam, dry-nursed with rough hands, Should you abandon it. I have said my say. Think of the Prince of Orange. In a word, Madam, those dog your steps who seek your life. Deign but to cast your gracious eyes hereon. [Presents the Queen with a paper. Elizabeth. Another letter from the Queen of Scots! See how her spider's web of sly-fox French Creeps o'er the paper! And to whom this letter? Walsingham. Deign but to glance at present to the end, And certify its signature. Elizabeth. We mark Her well-known signatureâthe âMary R., Queen Dowager of France.â Walsingham. And maybe queen Of England also, if we find no means To circumvent her. Madam, let the pray'rs Of those who have at heart, besides their love And loyalty towards you, love of God, Of England, of its old-establish'd lawsâ Let these prevail, and urge your majesty To prudent measures, and to just restraint, Directed where we need it most. Behold These twelve young gentlemen. Elizabeth. And are these tooâ These pretty gentlemen, well dress'd and shavenâ Our hidden enemies? Ah, there is he, The Irishman who fix'd us with his stare To-day at Richmond [recognising Barnwell's portrait.] Walsingham. All these gentlemen Are sworn together, madam, to complete The work begun in Holland. They are sworn, Under the guidance of the Scottish queen, To work your ruin. Even where we stand Stood one, a moment hence, who held conceal'd The dagger that should make her claim secure. Elizabeth. She cannot be so base, good Walsingham; Nor will we for one moment do such wrong To her intelligence. She seek our life Whom we (maybe from no great sister-love, But rather awe of that estate of queen, The which we also share) protected twice, First, from her angry Scots, who, as a hare Is mangled by the fierce besetting hounds Save for the huntsman, so had mangled her, And torn her limb from limb; she had lain cold Amongst her kingly kindred, but for us. And then, against her own delinquenciesâ Her murders, falsehoods, foul adulteriesâ Which had leaped forth to scare the waiting world From proofs these hands kept closed. The Queen of Scots! She seek our life! What! murder her first friend? Nay, nay! we will not credit it! Walsingham. Alas! I fear me, madam, 'tis a sorry truth; But time will test it. Elizabeth. She will stand the test. Zounds, sir! we who are woman understand A woman's dire temptationsâhusbanded Thrice by the priest, and often by the will Of wanton fancy. There be tangled webs Woven of wantonness, good Walsingham; And we can credit that there should at times Arise the wish to sever such as these. Yet, were we not her one defending voice? And would she silence it? What! add our blood To that with which her hands are reeking red? We cannot deem her fool as well as false. Let all the strength of her intelligence Protest against it! Let the wailing voice Of all the victims slain for love of her Protest against it! Let those murder'd men Protest against it! Murray, her own brother! Nay, let the strangled wraith of Henry Stewart Arise from out the ashes of his doom, And blaze the bloody work of Kirk o' Field To the four quarters of the winds of heaven, To damn her that was merciless, and so Protest against it! Walsingham. Madam, every voice Must needs protest against it, 'mongst the just In heav'n and earth; it rests but with your grace To see that they do not protest too late. Elizabeth. What is your plan of action? Would to heav'n We could dispense with hurdle, gallows, block, And quart'ring knife! Walsingham. The times are young for that, I fear, your grace. Tho' should you ask me when England may hope foreshadowing of peace, With shooting ear of plenty in her sheaves, I could but thus make answer, 'gainst my wishâ When God shall will that Mary Stuart shall die, Or your great wisdom haste the certain doom Of all humanity. Elizabeth. Nay, you and Cecil Seem but to see in queens mere common folk. Walsingham. We sometimes see in them, your majesty, Folk over-lenient, foolishly o'er-fond, And over-trustful; whilst in some we see Folk turbulent, assuming, serpent-tooth'd, Malignant, fawning, murderous, and false. Elizabeth. Hush, hush! She is our cousin, and a queen, And all is yet unprov'd. Walsingham. Her cyphers, madam, Are in our handsâthus may we test this queen. Her letters, also, are conveyed to us Ere ever they do reach their destined end. The heinous youths portrayed upon this scroll, We have their names, their comings and their goings Are well beknown to us; our agents note Their secret doings; some of them are hereâ âThey lurk in court and campâ (I quote the words Of one who wist not all I knew of him). The servant of the most determined traitor Is in our pay, and writes us word of all. One word, and all these vile conspirators Are gibbeted, like noisome stoats that stink From wayside hedges in the country lanes. Your majesty has glanced upon the letter Addressed to him that is the ringleader, One Babington by name, a gentleman Of good repute till now, in Derbyshire? Mark well her words of comfort to his cause, The hint as of some mystery, and then Her gracious leavetaking, as tho' to one Her subject and deliverer. Elizabeth. Alas! And that is he that standeth in the midst, High-featured; he that wears the shortest hair, The sharpest beard? Walsingham. That one is Babington. Upon his right is Ballard, in disguise A seminary priest; there, at his side, Stand Chidiock Titchborne, Windsor, Salisbury, And many more. Each instant that these live, A danger to your Majesty as great As is the biding in polluted air: For I, who know so much, am ignorant Of this one thingâI know not when they strike! Elizabeth. Then we will be as patient as themselves, And scorn to strike too soon. Let them live on, So that their plot may thicken, and involve All those that wish our ruin. We are bold, And fear nor man nor devil. Hang a warrant Over their foolish heads, and set your trap To test the Queen of Scotland. Mark my words, She will be still too wise to turn our foe. Or if she plays us false, let her beware! We are King Harry's daughter! [Exit. Walsingham (musing). Aye, once more âKing Harry's daughter!â Yet not his alone, Child of a mother destin'd to endure Disgrace and violence! Was her doom ordain'd Ere ever Henry Norris had her glove, And weigh'd her conduct nothing in the scale Of fate's mysterious balance? Who may say? And whether this, her daughter, wax o'er bold, Or turn to prudent measures? Is all plann'd And so decided for us, that our care Is only wasteful worrying? Alas! We see but dimly. Yet my utmost sight Is strain'd for England's weal, and ev'ry speck (E'en tho' no bigger than that little cloud Seen by the Prophet) on the furthest edge Of England's dark horizon, must command My keen solicitude; and this hath grown, E'en as a storm that flings athwart blue heav'n The black of nether hell. To save the queen, With all her king-craft and her woman-whims, Is one with saving England. At this point England hath need of her that is the queen. And we have need of herâour sovereign lady. Her faithful few, who having grasp'd their nettle, Feel not what stings the craven-finger'd fool. I, Walsingham, have need of her, my queen, Who needs me also, and our English land Hath need of Walsingham. He will not fail! [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA library in an old country house. Alice and her grandmother, Mrs. Bellamy. Mrs. Bellamy. But now that you are back, Alice, the sunshine is warm again. Tell me, child, what saw you in London? Ah, how well I mind me! years, years ago! gentlemen wore their shoes slashed then, as King Henry was gouty. A fine man, Alice; nay, a fine young man, though when I say this you will smile, seeing that to you he is ancient history! How do men cut their coats nowâafter France? Alice (wearily). I know not, dearest 'mother, but methinks France and Spain are the fashion with the Papists. Mrs. Bellamy. Ah well, 'tis true these be but small things, as compared to the kingdom of God! Your beauty, child, is a shadow: heed it not, as once I heeded mine. Ah! had you gone to Court, you might have heard sad tales of me! Well, well, one is not o'er wise at seventeen. Your grandfather was one of the handsomest men of his time. Folks praised us both. Alice. And he loved you?âabove Court favour, above plots and counterplots, and brake not his faith unto you? Mrs. Bellamy. Loved me! Ah, could you but have seen his love, 'twas the talk of the town! And then his jealousy! Alice. You never gave him cause? Mrs. Bellamy. Not wittingly, child, not wittingly; but I had only to speak a kind word to a Court gallant, only to show the tip of my shoeâso (my feet were always small) only to lift my handâso (Holbein has painted my, hand), and your grandfather seemed in one moment transformed into the Evil One. How he stormed and raved! How he reviled and cursed me! But I am foolish, Alice, thus to dwell on the pleasures of youth! Read to me from the Scriptures. We wait for God's kingdom. [Crosses herself. Alice (reproachfully). Dear 'mother, remember you are now of the new faith, and these popish signs should be as nothing to you. Mrs. Bellamy. As you say, child, with us these things are as nothing, and I am grieved at the contumacy of your uncle, my youngest son, who will not conform himself to the Protestant faith. Howbeit, 'tis an old habit, which comes natural to one born, as I was, a Papist, and who waited, as I have told you, upon the mother of the late Queen Mary, Mrs. Bullen being my fellow-tirewoman. But tell me more of London. What did you on the eve of my wedding-day? A day you had good cause to remember, sweet one, since without it you had not been here at my knee. Alice. Ah, grandmother, I had a dream, and such a dream! I shudder as I think of it! My very flesh creepsâand it was on your wedding-day too. Do you believe, dear grandmother, in visions? Mrs. Bellamy. There be visions and visions, grandchild; and though nine out of ten may come of an ill-baked pasty, or of wine too young in the wood, yet we read of visions in God's word; and I have heard say that without baking or boiling, or drinking wine, there have been visions. Some are of God. Alice. This was my horrid dream: I was in Londonâ In London and aloneâand Anthony (My Anthony I deem'd not long ago, Ere he had broken faith to me and mine) Had said to me, âSweet Alice, I am thine In life and death.â Methought he said the words At some high altar, but the priest was hid, So saw I not his vestments, neither knew If he were of the new faith or the old, Nor wist I how the nuptial church was deck'dâ If trick'd in popish-wiseâ Mrs. Bellamy. It bodes ill luck To dream of being in a church in white. Go on. Alice. You know 'tis good to be belov'd, And know your true love beautiful. Anon You made your boast of him you wedded onceâ My grandfatherâhis love, his jealousy, His noble presence. All the pride of heart You felt in those far days before my birth Felt I, dear mother, seeing Anthony Stand by me, straight and tall, beside the steps Of that high altar; but, as all my heart Uplifted in its gratitude to heaven, Most suddenly the altar was transform'd Into a grilling furnace, through whose bars The red-hot fierceness scorch'd my very cheek. I turn'd away to shun the angry glare, And met the fix'd eyes of the hooded priest, Till then conceal'dâthe man that married us. Mrs. Bellamy. It bodes a very burning up of love To dream that you are married near a fire. Alice. Hear on, sweet 'mother, so your dear gray hair Wax not the whiter as I tell my tale. Mrs. Bellamy. Oh, child, a dreamâonly an idle dream. We all of us have had our foolish dreams. Mine were as strange as any. I rememberâ Alice. Nay, hear me out. The hidden hooded priest Here turn'd on me his eyesâtwo coals of fireâ And then I saw his faceâa peelÃ¨d skullâ As though 'twere Death's own semblanceâand his hands Rattled against the glowing altar-rails, Naked and fleshless, as he leant thereon, The better to behold me. Then the church, Aisle, nave, and choir, seemed crowded with dim forms, Shrouded and hooded, swarming thick as rooks Gleaning a field of barley. At the first I thought that suddenly the sheeted dead Had risen thousand strong from where they'd lain Down in the damp church vaults, their tablet stones Uplifting, for some strange accomplishment Of God's high purposeâbut, in truth, I wrong'd The sainted dead. Mrs. Bellamy. What were they? Tell me, child. Alice. Fiends, 'mother. Could they have been else than fiends? Although their features, hidden under cowls, Show'd not to shock me, yet methought their shrouds Hung down fan-folded, like a bat's limp wing That tires of flitting. But e'en as I gazed Leap'd they the fenced partitions of the aisle, And came towards us, as a thunder cloud Darkens the last faint patch of summer sky. Then, sparing me, they closed on Anthony, And drawing from beneath their folded cloaks Falchions and pointed weapons, with the same, With one accord, those nearest of the fiends Cleft him asunder, as they cleave a traitor Quick after hanging, till his sever'd head Came rolling to me (oh, my love! my love!), I watching, dumb with horror, all my brow Beading with anguish, for so warm the blood That ran from him so lately warm with life And love of me, I could not choose but deem He knew and lov'd me still, and that pale brow Held soul and sense of Anthony. My grief Outweighing maiden fear, I stooped to kiss And bid farewell unto my true love's face, Deeming his dear lips waited for my kiss And last farewell, but as I bent me down The blackest of the demons bent him too, And, snatching at the helpless waiting mouth By its poor boyish undergrowth of beard, He flung it in the furnace 'fore mine eyes, That stared in agony. Mrs. Bellamy. Oh, horrible! Alice. And, dearest 'mother, I, who dare not look Even at the maim'd body of a toad Crush'd by a cart-wheel, looking, saw all this; The tenderness I felt for ev'ry shred That once had seem'd my lover, making fear My second careâmy first that he should heed, All mangled as he was, my last fond words, And bless me ere he burnt. So lately lived My Anthony, that all my mind refused To know him kill'd; I deem'd but his young life Dispersed, yet sentient. My Anthonyâ Nay, twenty Anthonys, dash'd on the ground, As one might spill red sacramental wine (Wherein, as Papists deem, God's spirit lives, Who worship Him in ev'ry crimson stain), So seem'd these bleeding fragments of poor flesh My Anthonyâall marr'd and murder'd thusâ Helpless to clasp and kiss, or say farewell, But still my Anthonyâstill loving meâ Not turn'd into a foe. Mrs. Bellamy. Most terrible! And was he dead, his young life shiver'd thus To twenty atoms? Rather had it seem'd To me, as 'twere the sacramental cup, Dash'd by some angry demon to the ground, Spilling God's spirit. Alice. Aye, far rather this Than that which is to follow! Bear with me, This memory unnerves me. Mrs. Bellamy. My poor child, I marvel not that fear possess thy heart At so great horror; most assuredly The Lord hath spoken to thee in a dream. Alice. The worst's to come. My only abject fear That I might lose my love, nor let him know Once more my love of him, I leant across The altar rails to where the furnace glow'd, Betwixt the iron bars whereof I saw My Anthony's poor face, yet unconsumed, Seeming transparent, as an agate held This side the light; but as I form'd my lips Into a word of tenderness, his own All suddenly grew to a ghastly grin, As tho' of dire derision. I beheld, Glitt'ring, an angry double-row of teeth, Saw-sharpen'd, with the furnace red behind; These closed on one another, as he hiss'd The name of her he lov'dâthe Queen of Scots; Then laugh'd a grating laugh, the which the fiends Echoed, till all the rafters of the church Shook with the ghastly chorus, whilst his lips Burn'd slowly to a cinder, whose last words Had left me doubly desolate. 'Twas then I heard these words, deliver'd at the last, By one whose voice rang louder than the fiends' Harsh, shrilling laughter: âTraitor unto heav'n! Traitor unto thy country and thy queen! Traitor to wife and child, and fond first love! E'en traitor unto traitors!â And there fell A silence, as may be the tomb's, and then I 'woke to find myself in mine own bed, In Fleet Street, at my cousin Willoughby's. Mrs. Bellamy. Indeed, indeed that were a vision sent Of heaven as a warning! Never dream Boded more evil to young Anthony, His soul and body both! 'Twere best to eschew One so ill starr'd, my Alice! In the days When you two, cousin-like, must needs, forsooth, Play carelessly at being man and wife, Against my wishes, was there no small voice That warn'd thee, Alice, that a youth thus fill'd (Like to the sails of some gay privateer, Gold-laden from the Indies, under Drake,) With winds that blow o'er many colour'd capes And coral-stranded isles, were no fit mate For one whose life, like thine, has been retired And hidden 'mongst the folk-forsaken shades Of this old manor-house? Ah, 'tis a youth Headstrong and arrogant, he stands foredoom'd. Men say his mind is fill'd with foolishness Since he return'd to England from abroad. But there are other men as good as he In England, aye, and better too, my child, And cousins, too, upon thy father's side, Worth ten of Anthony for steadfastness; Your cousin Willoughby's brave soldier-son, Your guardianâa man of twice your years, But none the worse for thatâa steady man, One in whose care I fain would leave my girl. True, Anthony is richâbut what is wealth To one attainted? Alice. Nay, that very wealth Was what I seem'd to love in him the least. Mrs. Bellamy. You are a foolish child; learn to be wise Of one who has paid wisdom's bitter price. Alice. Yet not to warn himâif indeed the voice Of God hath spoken! I who ne'er can be His wife, since now another bears his name, May I not be his guardian, to point, If not the road to good, at least the road That leads away from evil, maybe death? You would not have me husband so my breath As that I should not waft him one good word, But let him go his way? Mrs. Bellamy. How should a maid Pursue a young man, to unearth the thought Deep buried in his dark ambitious soul? Not meeting him, it were not safe to trust Your fears unto a letter in these days, Since if, indeed (as I have heard surmised), He herd with traitors, to admonish him Of what might be his danger were to you A danger likewise. Ah! I know these days In which we live, who all my life have dwelt As spied by Argus eyes! I scarce dare think! To know a traitor means to aid a traitor; To love a traitor means to be a traitor; To be a traitor meansâit means the block! Alice (sadly). The block is our most merciful escape From these dark days. I pray I meet no worse, For 'tis at least an honourable death (Since those have died on it who did no wrong), And some say painless. Mrs. Bellamy. Those who told thee this Had ne'er endured such painlessness. But fie On one of my ripe years to let you speak Of blocks and traitors! Out on me, I say, For an old fool, despite my silver hair. We scare ourselves until we almost start At our own shadows! [Both start, hearing knock at the door. Alice. Who is it that knocks? [Enter Giles, a servant.] Giles. The dutiful compliments of Colonel Nicholas Willoughby, but lately returned from the Low Countries, and might he visit you to-day at noon, after the dinner hour? He is halting at the inn at the town. Mrs. Bellamy. At dinner, Giles! at dinner! Our cousin Willoughby! No need, in sooth, that he should ask ere he visit those who will be o'er ready with a welcome! Bid him ten thousand times welcome, and we wait him impatiently! [To Alice.] Your cousin Nicholas, dear child, lately returned from the Low Countries! He comes at a happy moment to banish all our gloomy fears and presages! Alice. I feel in no mood for him. I cannot see him. Mrs. Bellamy. Alice! Your cousin Nicholas! He who used in the old time to call you his little wife! Alice. Aye, granny, I remember it well. His âlittle wife,â and I will never be his little wife! Mrs. Bellamy. A foolish childâalas! A foolish child! But girls are ever fanciful. Alice. Oh grandmother! I have yet kept something back. I did warn Anthony; I sought him out, yea even in a common tavern-room, where he and some companions sat at wine. Old Nancy met him in Newgate Marketâshe would have known his voice and noble bearing amongst a thousand; yet had she doubted, Mr. Salisbury, who was with him, would have confirmed her, he being without disguise. Anthony wore not his own hair, and had a beard. She saw him enter the tavern of the âThree Tuns,â whereof she apprised me, and we went there together. Mrs. Bellamy (reproachfully). Ah child, child! If I am to see you link your fate to a conspirator, I have indeed cumbered too long the earth; for I fear me report speaks but too truly, and that Anthony hath in hand some dark dealings. For what else his false hair and beard? or wild Tom Salisbury his companion, whose mother must rue the day she bore him? though, what could be hoped from one in the following of Lord Leicester? Ah, well-a-day! And you, Alice, seeming like my very own child! [Exeunt, sighing. [After a pause, enter Colonel Willoughby.] Willoughby. Here is the dear oak room, and all unchanged As when, a young man, all aflare with hope Of glory in God's cause, victorious arms, RetrievÃ¨d fortunes, and high honours won, I join'd to these a dream of home and love, When that fair slip of maidenhood, my ward, Then budding into girlhood, grew to be The woman she is now! I marvel much If she fulfil the promises she made To be a beauty? Let me thinkâher ageâ Her age must be by this some twenty years,â Those seven which have snatch'd my last of youth, And made of me this rough-hewn soldier-lout, Have changed her to a woman. [Looks in mirror. Forty years Mated to twenty summers! Forty years! And not so spent in holding dainty skeins Of lady's silk, in chambers arras-hung, Rustling with broider'd petticoats, that she, This gentle child, should deign to view my suit With eyes of favour. I shall seem to her Only the rude campaigner that I am, My fingers all too harsh to wind her skeins, Too rough to lure sweet music from her lute, Save at the risk of snapping all its strings Thro' clumsy handling, and with voice too gruff To trill a sonnet. [Enter Mrs. Bellamy. Mrs. Bellamy. Cousin Nicholas, Ten thousand welcomes! Aye, and wherefore sue Of one so proud as I to welcome you? Alice and I are all too pleased to bid You, our dear cousin, to our simple board. Willoughby. How is my cousin Alice? Mrs. Bellamy. Not o'er well. You will smile, cousin, at so much zeal in one so young, but I do believe she is vexed for the safety of the queen's majesty. Strange rumours reach us from town. Willoughby. You are hinting at these plots to assassinate the queenâthe disaffection among the Papists. Let my fair cousin rest; it will pass offâmere thunder showers to herald the brighter morrow. Let them come down, say I. [Enter Alice, unperceived. And as for the traitors, we shall gibbet them, cousin; we shall gibbet them. [Perceiving Alice, and taking her hand.] And so, fair cousin, we meet again. After a rough life in rough places I find myself once more in my boy haunts; for this old manor-house was known to me long ere you came to gladden it. [Aside.] As beautiful as one might imagine an angel! Alice. And yet after all, cousin Nicholas, they have done but little in Flanders for God's cause. Willoughby. All is as yet in a great uncertainty; but, as I was saying to my good cousin there, these be but thunder showers. Events will shuffle themselves right, by God's grace. The Frenchmen vexed us somewhatâ they being but half friends, and more than half foes, if the apple of discord may thus be split. But we wait God's good time. Alice. 'Twere hazardous dealing with them, without doubt. For me, true friend or true foe. Willoughby. Then, cousin, I am for youâyour true friend. Alice. Be not o'er rash, lest I should prove you, cousin, in some way you wot not of. You are returning to town ere long? Willoughby. Indeed I fear me, fair cousin, my stay must not extend over to-morrow. Though we are, as it were, disbanded, I shall not give up the soldier till these thunder clouds clear somewhat. My services are still at the disposal of my queen, and I am in this part on a special mission. Mrs. Bellamy. Your cousin means by thunder clouds, plots, Alice âplots which have their rise in Spain. Willoughby. Calm yourself, Alice. Let not these reports distress you. A cloud of midges in the airâthey bite, but rarely draw blood. No names are as yet given (nay, and if they were, it would ill become me to divulge them), but from all I hear some dozen foolish boys are banded together in the interest of the Scottish queen, who hath in her nature so little prudence and reserve, as we know of old, that through indiscretion she will betray even her own friends. But these conspirators are but like mites in a cheese, which may help it to seethe and fester, but which change not its outward form. So silly women and boys can never alter the form of the State. We want for that the club of a giant and a master mind. Alice. Alas! poor misguided young gentlemen! Willoughby. All we shall know of them in the after years, poor fools, will be their quarters hoisted to scare their fellows, and their heads rotting on Tyburn Gate. [Alice shudders. Mrs. Bellamy (turning the subject). How did you travel from London? Alone? Willoughby. Alone, save for my body-servant, and ill-mounted (for my horse cast a shoe on Hounslow Heath, and went lame from a flint), all through the desolate country between Bagshot and Blackwater, the wind wafting to my nostrils, ever and anon, the scent of the carrion swinging on Hartford Bridge Flats, set there to frighten other malefactors, who, nevertheless, still haunt this wild tract; so was I not displeased to fall in, near Basingstoke, with two gentlemen, well mounted and armed, attended by six servants, and with them I made some of my journey, parting company at Popham Lane, where the gentlemen were met with fresh horses from Micheldever. âTake mine,â said the elder of the two young gentlemen, âsince I have not far to go, and have saved mine to keep your paceâso that he will easily take me a short stage further.â This offer I gratefully accepted, seeing it was made with so good a grace, and by a gentleman born and bred, for then it was that I found him to be Mr. Titchborne, a Catholic gentleman of old family, living near Alton; but as he also frequents the town, I shall hope to repay his civility. Mrs. Bellamy. 'Tis a fine old name. I have heard say the Titchbornes have lived in South Hants and were of note before ever we were taken by the Normans. Willoughby. Anyhow, here was I the richer by a stout strawberry roan, Mr. Titchborne telling me he would care for my poor nag till my return; but upon hearing my destination, says the younger gentleman, âTake heed that I do not get there before thee! for I shall be that way myself in a day or two, and will bring you your horse, if he be cured, and take charge of my friend Titchborne's as far as Popham Lane. Mrs. Bellamy (to Giles, who enters). So, if a gentleman should come for Colonel Willoughby's strawberry roan, you will apprise us of it, so that we may not be wanting in civility to him. Young gentlemen do not come this way every day, do they, Alice? Alice. I care not whether they come or go! [Exit. Willoughby. And now, dear cousin, tell me of your son. Had that strange rumour aught of truth in it Wafted to me in Flanders, and which said That he had gone distraught? Mrs. Bellamy. He gone distraught! A son of mine! Why, even your whole body, Brave tho' it be, containeth not the sense He holds in half his hand! Yet list to me, I will not hide from you that he of late Hath strangely borne himâliving much apart, With Father Harington, a Jesuit, A learned man. And now these two together Have often left us women to ourselves, Too busy for the welfare of their souls To care how their despisÃ¨d bodies fare. He may be here anon, to eat with us, But there are times he flies from us all day. Yet is this godliness, not folly, cousin; And if at times he seems a moody man, Silent and self-contain'd, ah, blame him not; For why, his thoughts are all too high for us. His lot is hard.âAnd so they said distraught!â Distraught of Jeremy, whose angry face I would that you could look on when he knows They said he was distraught! Willoughby. Nay, pardon me, I did but ask the truth of these reports. But what is it that makes his lot so hard? Mrs. Bellamy. Well, look you, it was hardâhe as a lad Lov'd solitude and pray'r; and, being born In that old faith now crumbling, eagerly Read he of miracles, and martyr'd men Dying for God. Anon this new reform Crept o'er the land; and, finding many of us Waiting for purer ways of serving God, Grew like the sweet new ripeness of a fruit Flushing towards the light. Yet so imbued Was he, my second son, with his beliefs He would have burnt for them, so kept his faith Whilst we turn'd Protestant, seeing the day Veil'd from his eyes. You know he purposÃ¨d To take the priestly vow, but then our king Brake up the monasteries through the land. Later ensued his elder brother's death, Leaving us Alice only, and no son. Then said his father, âThou must make our house, Nor shall I will thee aught at my decease If thou should'st sink thy manhood in the monk; But baby Alice shall possess my all, Yet even she, should she, improvident, Wed with a Papist, shall be dispossessed.â From this she hath been saved. Willoughby. How? Wherefore saved? Mrs. Bellamy. 'Tis a long tale to tellâand you had heard Had there been aught in it of real import, You being left her guardian. Let it pass, For 'tis not worth the naming. Both were youngâ Their dream is long since overâyears agoâ Only a childish folly. Willoughby. Only that? Mrs. Bellamy. Aye, truly, cousin, and this in your earâ I think, had Jeremy not been my son Whom well I know above all base intent, I had imagin'd that he forced her somewhatâ Threw them togetherâdazzled the young man. This had I thought, had he not been my sonâ Yet being son of mine, methinks his friends Plotted thus putting Alice out of chance Of any stray inheritance. Willoughby. Well, well, But she hath truly put all this away? Mrs. Bellamy. I do believe itâbut you know young maids Will ofttimes nurse a shadow. 'Tis enough For them to gaze upon a faded rose Or kiss a tatter'd letter. These suffice Till some brave gentleman of flesh and blood Scare off such phantoms. [Enter Alice. Mrs. Bellamy goes into another part of the room, leaving them together.] Alice. Cousin Nicholas, Anon you said that you were my true friendâ I ask you a friend's service. Willoughby. Ask not twiceâ The service is perform'd. Alice. It is a letter I wish to send under your care to town. Willoughby. Indeed a paltry boon! and I that hoped You wish'd my right hand or my grizzled pate! Alice. Nay, do not jest; this is no common letter, Nor must you tell one in the whole of England That I entrusted it to you. 'Tis not yet writâ I ask you firstâ Willoughby. Nay, twenty thousand letters! I am your Mercury of the wingÃ¨d heel. Alice. Nor must you let it meet a living eye, Nor leave it carelessly to soil and fray Here in your leathern jerkin. Place it there! [Indicating his heart. It is for my near kinsman, Mr. Babingtonâ A private matter. Though you know him not, You know him, doubtless, as my mother's nephew; Like you, that makes him cousin; and he lodges Right in the way to go from Charing Cross Over the fields to London. Willoughby. I obey. Give me the letter privily and soon, As I must start to-morrow. Mrs. Bellamy. They are lateâ Your uncle and the Father. Sure to-day They will not shun our company. Good cousin, With your permission, we will seek the terrace, Where, should they come home by their common way, We needs must meet them. [Exeunt into the garden. [Enter Jerome Bellamy by another door, accompanied by Father Harington.] Bellamy. Aha! a few moments alone to consider ere we are plagued with the fat heretic! and pen and ink to scratch a word to that die-away wench, Alice. [Takes up pen and writes.] See, this will do. The most foolish of women can hoodwink a man, so you may trust her to lie to the trooper. [Reads.] âAnthony Babington will be here in less than an hour. There are reasons for deeming it expedient that he should not be known as such. He hath met Willoughby before, who yet was ignorant of his name. See that your grandmother and the servants speak of him as Mr. Bellingham, and thus take some trouble off the hands of him that houses you out of charity.â Giles! [Calling servant. Enter Giles. This message to Mistress Alice. She is in the garden. Give it her at once, and await her orders. [Exit Giles with letter. Father Harington. Mr. Babington hath a brave countenance and a most courteous bearing. Bellamy. He fatteneth on his one idea, which is to him like good roast meat after kickshaws. Father Harington. Which of the gentlemen is to kill the queen? Bellamy. There are six told off to do it, but Babington hath the ordering of them all. Abington, Titchborne, Barnwell, Tilney, and others. Some of them feel anxious for the end, but it is too late to cry off now. Tilney is for the queen being set upon in her coach. Mr. Titchborne wishes God could be served without killing her. Father Harington. Yet he said all was progressing happily? Bellamy. So happily that the end is almost sure. The Prince of Parma is holding himself in readiness. Our long service has not been without plentiful fruition. Father Harington. âGod prosper the harvest!â [Exeunt. Scene II. âA garden. Moonlight. Colonel Willoughby and Alice. Willoughby. Ah, this is such an often-fancied scene Of perfect home contentment, that I doubt These very eyes that look on it, and deem The whole some fleeting vision! Alice. None the less Yours is true sight, since I with mine own eyes See this same peaceful scene, and thank God for it. Willoughby. Then you, sweet cousin, are content with thisâ These long, white, moonlit alleys, and these bars Of close-cropp'd cypress? Far beyond their shade Know you there lies a wondrous outer world Of toil and turmoil? As the nestling, warm From her soft breast that shelter'd it from ill, Strains o'er the edge of home and longs for wings, Have you, dear cousin, dream'd no dream of life Far from these flat park lands? Alice. Yes, oftentimes, And yet, as often have I pray'd to heav'n, To keep me from the taint of outer life. Willoughby. Yet outer life not always needs corrupt. Rather, methinks, after our first hot blood, We who have donn'd the wand'rer's sandalled shoon, See in our sweetest dreams green waving fields, Or some such scene as this, with one hard by Seeming as fair as now you seem to meâ The airy shape my spirit hath adored, Transform'd into a woman! Alice. I have heard That soldiers see in ev'ry passing form Some such divinity. But it is lateâ My grandmother has left us; come, good cousin, Surely my uncle has return'd by now. Mrs. Bellamy (approaching). I dream of my young days. How fair the night! Take care of Alice, cousin, whilst once more I pace the ivy terrace. Willoughby. Listen, Alice, Leave me not now, whilst my unutter'd words Are rising nigh to choke me! For this hour I've seen foreshadow'd in my soldier's life, Seeming a ray from some superior world, Of utmost light and beauty! Know of me That tho' I speak the language of rude camps, Mine ne'er hath been the knee, till now, to bend, As you would deem, to any passing form; Nor have I knelt to one in woman's shape, As now I kneel to you, sweet cousin Alice! [Makes as though he would kneel. Alice. What would you with me that you kneel to me? Rise, you abash me. Willoughby. I am all unused To fine set-phrases; will you be my wife? Alice. Oh! cousin, can I be no other thing, And so the better serve you? since my heart Is that one only gift I must withhold. Willoughby. Then, Alice, let me never see you more! Too much has hung upon too slight a thread, I was a fool to dream that one like you Could stoop to love me. Let us say farewell. Alice. Ah! cousin, are we women good for naught Saving for wives or lovers? and of us Can it be never said, as of you men, âThey two are friends, they two bear right good will One t'ward the other?â Must it ever be, âThey two are lovers,â or, âThey two are foes?â Willoughby. Where is the friendship that survives the sight Of looks forlorn, and wit that vanisheth At one friend's coming? Alice. Nay, say rather this, Where is the friendship that survives the blow Dealt to a vanity o'er sensitive? For such, methinks, is your man's love of us. And yet, too often, 'tis from no pretence Of being better that we women shrink From taking all you offer us; as oft 'Tis we who feel unworthy so full love, Who, maybe, have not heart to give you back. Some may have lov'd and may not love again;â These are the women who are meant for friendsâ True as the friend I fain would be to you. Willoughby. So you have also lov'd, poor child, like me? Alice. Perchance: suffice it that my heart is cold, Nor wakes for aught save friendship; it may be That once, like that poor fledgling from its nest, I, leaning o'er the moss-embroider'd stone Of this gray terrace, flank'd with peacock yews, Craned at the outer world, and saw my fateâ One who was born to strive beyond these bounds Of yew and cypress. Now all this is past; Nor will I say, so you should pity me, âMy heart is love-sick of a great past love,â Since, whether love, or whether loss of love, I know not wholly which I mourn the most; Yet this I know, that whilst one lives on earth, And breathes, (though not for me,) his breath of life, I ne'er will wed with other living man! Willoughby. Then would that he were dead! Alice. Hush! hush! alas, You know not how such evil wish may speed! E'en now he seems to walk a man foredoom'd! [Enter Giles with a letter. Gives it to Alice, who reads (aside) in agitation.] âAnthony Babington will be here in less than an hour. There are reasons for deeming it expedient that he should not be known as such. He hath met Willoughby before, who yet was ignorant of his name. See that your grandmother and the servants speak of him as Mr. Bellingham, and thus take some trouble off the hands of him that houses you out of charity.â What strange confirming of my darkest fears! [Calls back Giles and explains to him contents of letter. Willoughby watching at short distance. To Willoughby.] Only a homely household matter, cousin; We are to have another guest at supper. Willoughby (continuing). So you have lov'd, poor Alice? then for me Feel some kind pity; as for him you lov'd, I ask no news of him, I want no word To tell me who he was or what his name; Nay, I would rather never see his face. Giles (throwing open window leading into garden). Mr. Bellingham. [Enter into the garden Babington, Bellamy, Mrs. Bellamy, and Father Harington.] Willoughby (aside). My fellow-trav'ller, who, with Chidiock Titchborne, Rode with me through the moorlands of South Hants! Yet how the sudden sounding of his name Came like the answer to my hasty words! [Exeunt into the house, through the window. Scene III. âBabington standing alone at the deserted supper-table, a broken wine-cup on the floor. [Enter Alice.] Babington (raising wine to his lips). Your health, cousin Alice, and a handsome husband from amongst the young men you may favour! [Drains the cup. Alice (sadly). What is the worth of a young man's love? Babington (scornfully). Oh, we all know it hath in it none of the force or the fire of a maiden's; and she will love in such pretty ways tooâtrying for the letter of his name with a snail crawling over a slate, or flinging over her shoulder the peel of an apple to see in what form it will fall! Alice. It hath never fallen as an A. Babington. No, nor a B. either with me! Alice. What, did you ever try for my name? Babington. First tell me how long since you tried for mine? Alice. Why think at all of what was so long ago? Babington. Are we, then, now grown so wise? Our letters are the same, AliceâA.B.âA.B. Is there no subtle meaning, think you, herein? Alice. It was meant that we should never be joined, save by the links of friendship. You have heard of the sayingâ If you change your name and not your letter You change for the worse and not for the better. This is a saying that they have down in Kent. Babington (passionately). What care I, Alice, for the men of Kent? What care I if the whole of England join'd, Strong-tongued and vehement, to shriek the words, You two are never to be link'd together? Should I believe, or lend an ear to that I knew was false? Alice. Nay, listen, Anthony, I fain would speak with youânot many words; I come to supplicate you on my knees To speak of this most horrid mystery, Which seems to suck you to its hidden depths As would a whirlpool. Something is amiss, And threatens England whilst it threatens you. Now, tho' I never can be wife of yours, Tho' all the love that liv'd betwixt us two Is shiver'd like yon crystal drinking-cup, Yet in my woman's heart some echo stays The which your footfall wakes; some little pearl, Toss'd by the tempest, ling'ring after storm, To mind me that I lov'd you onceâand thus I would befriend you. Hear these few poor words From your true sister-cousin. May she speak? Babington. Speak onâspeak ever in those silv'ry tones, So sister-calm! And hath it come to this Betwixt us two, who swore nor life nor death Should ever part us? Hath it come to this, âYour sister-cousin?â and am I to rest Contented with a sermon? Preach your bestâ I listen to your words, but mark you, Alice, I give no chilly brother-love for yours. Alice. You being husband, father, and my cousin, Will list to words of reason, nor renew A foolish dream we 'woke from years ago (Full four long years), wherefrom you 'woke the first. Babington. âWherefrom I 'woke the first!â And what were we Those four years since, my Alice? What were we?â A girl and boy playing with but the shadow Of this dear night's reality. Alice (reproachfully). Oh, cousin, Think of your wife who loves you, and your child! Babington. Were you this incarnation of all light, All majesty, all beauty, all repose? Was I the man who now, here at your feet, Cries to your heart for pity? Since those days I have seen women who were counted fair, Living in courts and camps and convent-walls, And I have wander'd forth thro' many lands, Dreaming my dreams of man's strange purpose here, Seeking the shadow of the one ideal, The which I clasp to-night! [Endeavouring to embrace her. Alice. Oh, Anthony! For love of all your saints, leave go your hold! Babington. Then say you do not love me, looking thus Into these eyes that hunger, say the wordsâ Alice. I do not love you. Babington (excitedly). How! You dare to lie, Thus looking at me? But your beating heart Tells me you lie! Thank heaven that you lie! Alice. Oh, Anthony, I leave you! You are madâ The wine has turn'd your brain. Think of your wife. Babington. Look youâmy wife is nothing to my heart Compared to what you are: for worthiness, True-heartedness, and kindness are not love. Love is a master-passion, and obeys No tyrant rein nor spur; you lov'd me, Aliceâ And now my heart is ripe to meet your love. I know the nothingness of all my aims, And kneel to you for mercy. [Kneeling and clasping her hands. Alice (with emotion). What would you? Your words are as a madman's! Babington. This would Iâ My horse is ready saddled, and the night Will curtain us, save for yon rising moon. You are my more than life. I may not live Without your love. Come, bless a broken lifeâ Be the old loving Alice of the past, And naught shall separate us. Alice. Fly with you?â Now!âleave my uncle's house!âleave honour, friends, For one who cannot even be mine own! Become an outcastâplunge in misery A virtuous lady and her innocent babe! Your childâyour childâah! has he eyes like yours? I shall be never wife and never mother! [Weeps. Babington. This, then, was all your boasted love of me. Oh, what a light and overrated thing Is woman's love!âmost, women that are fair! How do they deal in phrases neatly set, And call it loving, whilst their hearts beat cold A measured tune beneath their bodicesâ Those buckram bulwarks that so well defy Our boldest sallies! [Laughs hoarsely. Alice (shuddering). Nay, nay! laugh not thus! Such laugh is crueller than fifty frowns, The while I see your angry glitt'ring teeth Seeming saw-sharpened. Babington. So you drive me hence, I and this poor unwelcome love of mine. You wish me hence?âsay it with your own lips! Alice. I wish you hence! I do not love you! Go! Babington. I go. But, Alice, listen to my wordsâ I go to what will doubtless seem to you A sure perdition. Yet are you the cause, Since you could save me. Alice (eagerly). Save you? Tell me how! I would giveâ Babington (interrupting). Words againâmere woman's words! You that seem'd ready once to cede your soul Shrink now from hazarding that wav'ring thing Gone with a breath, like spring's most fragile flower, Or braving unabash'd the fiercest stormsâ At once the fairest, falsest, foulest thingâ A woman's reputation! Alice. Scorn me not, But say, how may I serve you? Babington. Look you here, I will admit I had forgot how fair Had seem'd the face that lured me when a lad. Alice. You only lov'd my face? Babington. Not that aloneâ Soul, mind, and body, you were meant for me. Yet had you left me wholly, it may be I had forgotten. But you could not rest, Being a woman from your topmost thread Of auburn hair down to your pretty shoe, And so you said, âI will not let him rest, He shall not thus get quit of me.â Alice. Indeed, I never thought to look upon you more! Babington. And for this reason, at the evening hour You sought me in a tavern; blinding me With such a blaze of unexpected light, You shook my best endeavours. It was strangeâ My comrades, drinking, swore for evermore To bury all their foolish earthly loves, And cling alone to her that reigns in heavenâ They drank, but as the wine cup pass'd to me I heard your voice, and pausing, did not drink. Alice. Would you had drank of it! then had you now Spared me for your vow's sake. What! did I sin So deeply, loving once, that you should scorn And curse me now? Babington. Alice, I curse you not, 'Tis I am cursed by you. To you is given The saving of me, but you scorn the task. Now listen to me, and behold what hangs On your girl-wisdom! Ah, not I alone Await your will, but England, and the queen, With half her nobles. As you see me now, I am that Babington of whom hereafter It will be said, he suffer'd for the cause Of God and true religion; in a word, I am the one head mover in this scheme, Hatch'd nigh to breaking forth, to kill the queen! Alice (in horror). To kill the queen! Elizabeth, the queen! Babington. To kill the queen of England. All is plann'd, The train is laid, it only needs the match (The which I hold or else withhold) to fire; Then for that Babington whom men will name In grateful hist'ry's bolder after-page, Rich guerdon and renown, and high estate, Should heaven prosper us. This I renounce For love of you; I lay it at your feet, Deeming you richer spoil than all the gold Of Philip's Indiesâthis, if all succeed; But if it pleaseth God to chasten us, Humbling our hopes, because too rainbow-hued, Then for that Babington whom the future page Of servile hist'ry will denounce as base, Regicide, villain, unregenerate. The blight of early doom made terrible, A cloven traitor's writhing agonyâ This save me, Alice. Alice. Oh, you torture me! Your love of me is cruel as the rack! Babington. See what you damsels fondly set against Your boasted maiden-honour in the scale! How precious is that pure virginity You save for someone! Alice. Nay, you scorn'd it once, And shall I prize what you have flung aside? I have before me honour, dutyâthese, And more, the honour that I owe your wife, The love methinks I yet must bear your child. Ask me to die for you. Babington. To die for me! To die for me! That any fool could do. Nay, live for me, and reign my queen of loves! For you I leave all honours and renounce All dangerous designs. Ah, Alice, come, Come to these arms that wait you! Alice. Anthony, I prithee leave me, or I leave you first! Babington (moving towards window). I leave you, and I leave all good with you. I go, my soul despoilÃ¨d of its wings. You drive me from you for you do not love me, I go to meet my destiny. Farewell! [Exit out of window into garden. Alice. He goes to meet his destiny! Just heav'n, Why dost Thou try me? Ah, I âdo not love!â Not love you, Anthony? God help my love! God help us both! [Falling on her kneesâcontinuing. Aye, what is this poor form Of fainting, hesitating flesh and blood, That I should set it thus against the State, Against his dearest will, who seem'd to me Once, more than queen and England all in one? Nayâit is less than nothing! Still to wrong One I have never seen, yet one I know Noble and worth his loving. But the Stateâ âThe queen with half her nobles,â is not this Of more importance to the nation's good Than even that pure life with all its trust? Ah, help me, heaven! since my senses blurred Refuse to lend me light! [Rising from her knees. I have a plan Whereby to save him! What is this poor life, This vaunted maiden-honour? For his sake I will so shame myself in all men's eyes As that they scoff at me, e'en tho' he own Naught that is mine save this weak, falt'ring hand, The which I pray may guide him! Yes, my pray'rs, My tears shall move him. I will kneel to him, Nor leave him till he swear by ev'ry saint To shake him quit of all the dark designs That lure him to perdition! Then shall she Who loves him, maybe as I lov'd him once, Hold to her heart once more a gentleman Whose name shall blot no future hist'ry's page. Yes, I will strive to ward aside the storm, Nor perish in this light'ning flash of love! [Writes hurriedly, and reads afterwards aloud. âI will do as you desire, so you bid farewell to treason; and will join you on the ivy terrace, as the clock strikes ten.â [Enter Giles as though to remove the supper.] Alice. Giles, you have ever been a trusty servant; See here this letter, 'tis for Mr. Babingtonâ Nay, I will even put his name upon it, His new name sounding strange to me; and hark, See no one hath it saving Mr. Babington. Giles. He cross'd towards the stables as I pass'd, Booted and spurr'd. He doth not stay with us? Alice (in agitation). Noâyes. (My brain seems reeling, and my words Will tell my secret!) No, he does not stayâ We do not stay. Ah, Giles, think kindly of me! God bless you, trusty Giles; give me your hand. Giles (giving his hand, after first wiping it). A rough one, madam, but 'tis at your service. Alice. Go now, and give the letter. [Exit. Giles. Poor young lady! Her head seems wand'ring! Taking after him, Our moody master! He is wrong in the head, Sure as my name is Giles. Now for the letterâ âTo Mr. Babingtonâ examining it]. Ah, Mr. Babington! I mind me when we used to see you here, Flesh days and fast days, sweet on Mistress Alice. Methought one day I might have pledged your name With hers in such a bumper as this here. Now I must drink them singly; howsomever, The better plan for one who loves good liquor. [Pours out goblet of wine, after first placing letter on table behind him. [Enter Willoughby, who does not perceive Giles.] Willoughby (to himself). Well, wellâ'tis for the bestâ'tis for the best. Maybe 'twere foolishness to take a wife In these unsettled times; yet will I serve her, And be her sworn true knight. Aha! the letter, Which I had nigh forgotten, lately sealed By that soft cruel hand! [Taking possession of letter, after first kissing it. Reading over the direction. âTo Mr. Babington.â Yes, yes, her mother's nephew. [Perceiving Giles. Ah, what now? When masters pray or slumber varlets drink. On with my mantle for me. Hast a lantern? Giles (confused). A lantern?âaye, a lanternâMistress Aliceâ Willoughby. Make her my humble compliments, good Giles; Then to the stables; whence I seek the villageâ And so to London. Giles (aside). Out upon the letter! Where hath it wing'd to? Willoughby. Come, thou honest varlet! [Aside.]Yes, better not to see herâbest to leave her Silently, reverently, as a mem'ry Of something sad and holy, gone for ever. [Exeunt into garden. [Enter Alice wrapped in a cloak.] Alice (nervously). Voices! How anxiously my heart is beating! 'Tis not now ten o'clock, so Anthony Waits me not yet. I would that they would hastenâ If they should see him waiting! Well, what matter, So they guess not he waiteth there for me? Alas! what dare I hopeâwhat dare I pray for? Success or failure? For I seem to stand Upon a dizzy height, with storms above; Whilst at my feet a horrid precipice Yawns to receive me! [Re-enter Giles from garden. Giles (muttering to himself). A dang'rous time to travel, by my faith! A foolish time to travel: but young heads Are stronger than their elders'. Alice. Think you so? Nay, worthy Giles, the world is new to them, With all its dangers. Giles. By your leave, my lady, I think young heads will bear the hardest knocks, And house more harmless bullets. In mine own There ran just now a silly old wife's tale Of highway robbers; how her goodman's hat Had twenty shot-holes on that Easter-eve The when she thought he had been fooling her With village wantons. So I said of the night, âA dang'rous time to travel.â Alice (impatiently). Foolish tales! Giles. She hath the old hat stillâ Alice. Nay, leave me now. Your clatter deafens meâI have the vapours. Giles. For which, dear madam, take the head of a mole, So it be caught towards the moon's decline, And let it drip into a mug of beer Brew'd on the birthday of some gentleman Who owneth abbey landsâ Alice. Away, good Giles. Methinks you too have drunk of some such brew. Get thee to bed! Giles. 'Tis true I drank his health Ere he departed. Alice (surprised). Is my cousin goneâ My cousin Willoughbyâand no good-bye? Giles. I heard him mutter it were better so. He sent you, madam, his profound respects. Alice. Well, well. Now go. Giles. So, mistress, by your leave (Forgive an old man who upon his knee Hath ofttimes dandled you), two gentlemen Of brave appearance, fearing man nor devil, Will slink into the night like two kick'd curs, For sake of two bright eyes; and yet, in sooth, Who ever used to hold his head as high As Mr. Babington? Alice (in astonishment). How, Mr. Babington? Giles. He whom we thought would be our master here, Only the wind blew wrong. The Mr. Babington That rides to-night to London. Alice. Rides to London? Where is he? Giles. On the road, and some way on, With Colonel Willoughbyâthey ride together. And so I said anon, like two kick'd curs, Go from this house two gallant gentlemen, Because of two bright eyes; whilst of the night I said (an' so it please youâby your leave), A dang'rous time to travel. Now I go. Alice (eagerly). Not yet! Not yet! Ah, where is Anthony? Giles. Poor Mr. Anthony! He crosses now The lone marsh lands betwixt us and the village, With Colonel Willoughby. They ride together Alone and unattended, Peter Barton Will only join them there. I have known men That rather would have broke their necks than ride Alone and unattended by that way. Alice (passionately). How, gone? So he could go, heart-whole and free, And leave me?âleave me seeming unto him The thing my letter made me out to be?â A moth lured by the flicker of a love Too fierce to ease the aching of this heart! Oh heart! why didst thou ache for such as he? Oh hand that wrote to him the words he scorn'd, Thank God thou art not slave that wears his ring! So I have bent me to the very earth, And kiss'd those feet in fancy that have fled, And left me crush'd and blushing and ashamed! Ashamed? And wherefore should I be ashamed? Deem'd he I plann'd this all for love of him? For love of him who left me, loving once, To wed another? Nay! My love is dead! This was for England!âthis was for the queen With half her nobles! Whilst that Babington Whose name shall blot our hist'ry's future page, I know him notâhe is not kin of mineâ He is forgotten! [Sobbing.] Oh, my heart is broken, Now Anthony is gone! [Sinks towards a chair, half fainting. Giles (supporting her). Ah, poor young lady! Her mind is surely failing! Poor young lady! Scene IV. âBabington (under the name of Bellingham) and Colonel Willoughby waiting under a tree, surrounded by a swamp, with reeds, &amp;c., having lost their way. Horses tied up near. Babington. So now our hare-brained plan of riding seven miles in the dark meets its proper rewardânay, we do not even deserve this dry spot to rest upon, where I see nothing for it but to wait till daylight; for we can go neither backwards nor forwards in this damnable slough, and we have wandered some way off the road. Willoughby. Be of good courage, Mr. Bellingham. Methinks anon I heard voices and the clank of horsemen. We are not far off the beaten track. Babington. Oh, it is not my courage that fails me, I was but laughing at our sorry plight! Confess now, colonel though you be, that there are fires more enticing than those of these will-o'-the-wisps, and more terrible even than those of your Flanders campaign. Confess that it was the same cause made fools and cowards of us both? Willoughby (sternly). How, sir, the same cause? And how cowards? Most of all, how coward? Babington. Oh, do not âsirâ me. I am honest and outspoken, for a man may speak his mind in a morass. Walls have ears, but your green duckweed and black bulrush are safe listeners. It was Mistress Alice drove us both out of house and home, and lodged us here with such scant comfort. Confess, colonel, you are as deep in love with her as our bodies anon were plunged in this reeking quagmire! Willoughby. Every heart hath its own secrets, Mr. Bellingham; and, without seeming squeamish to you, let me say that the man who keeps these to himself is the wisest. Who goes there? [Hearing voices. Babington (cocking his pistols). Who goes there? [Masked figures advancing, armed; amongst them the traitor-servant of Babington. 1st Stranger. Take him that called the other Bellingham! 2nd Stranger. Nay, take the one that was called Bellingham by the other. 3rd Stranger. We are robbers of the queen's highway. There is no escape. Deliver up your moneys and papers. [Willoughby overpowered by numbers, his pockets and saddle-bags rifled. 4th Stranger (having discovered the letter addressed to Babington on Willoughby). This is our man, and now for a noble recompense. 2nd Stranger. âGod prosper the harvest!â Babington (recognising the voice of Peter Barton). Traitor! [Shoots him dead and escapes, leaving Willoughby with the supposed robbers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âA guard-room at Tutbury Castle. Lord Shrewsbury, holding in his hand Walsingham's letter. Messenger standing near a window looking into the grounds. Shrewsbury (muttering to himself). Strange! there must be some deeper meaning in these words than meets my dull understanding. [Reads.] âBe not over stern with the Queen of Scots, now her health faileth. No need to restrain her to the leads, if she can take the air in the gardens;â and then these words afterwardsââBut keep close watch on her morning, noon, and night.â If 'tis to trap her I will be no party to it, for she must lull herself with no hope of a false security. Heigho! what with these two queens and mine own she-devil, life is but a sorry pastime! Messenger (advancing). Is there no way, my lord, by which I might have sight of the queen ere I return to London? Doth she ever use these gardens? So I might but see her pass I should be content. A right royal lady still, I hear. Shrewsbury. No doubt but what meets the eye is that which pleaseth most in her, and this I say after some acquaintance; and yet much of the beauty of this queen is bought, aye, and as yet unpaid for. Messsenger. But will she pass into the garden? Shrewsbury. She hath been abed for the last five days, pleading an abscess in her neck, and this, with the swelling of her legs, hath made my work easier; yet not one of these things can be sworn to, for, you must know, she hath her own physician. Now, this is the way with this queen, she will lie in bed eight days at a stretch, sometimes denying herself to all comers, untired and slovenly, after the manner of the French, and looking (as I am told by my lady) double her age when bereft of those dyes and pigments that so help her beauty. Messenger. My lord, you are somewhat hard on her majesty. Shrewsbury (continuing). At other times she will sit arrayed in all that she hath of her bestâand she hath gewgaws enow in all conscience, seeing that now we are moving from Tutbury she demandeth eighty waggons to carry them. At these times she will see those that are allowed audience of her, eating with them, or playing games with dice or draughts on the coverlid of her bed, and entertaining them with lively talk. I hear that she hath entertained embassies in this fashion in Scotland, and this, coupled with her extravagance and her adulteries, so outraged the rough Scots that it lost her her kingdom! Messenger (smiling). You are, indeed, merciless, my lord, to what many deem only the pretty failings of woman! Shrewsbury. Nay, nay; I am but just. There is much in her that is neither pretty nor womanly, but she hath some great qualities. Lesser at times than a woman, there are moments when she rises above the mental height of a man; and could Langside have been won by courage and despising of fatigue, she had not now been hereânor I either, God help me! Messenger. Is any of this old courage remaining to her? Shrewsbury. At times, when suddenly rising, she will order saddle-horses, and hunt and hawk one day after another, making the limbs of the ladies of her following to ache for a week. How they endure it I marvel. But her chiefest virtue is to endear to her those about her immediate person. Though 'tis, peradventure, but the calculation of a selfish nature, to insure that they leave no whim ungratified. Messenger (smiling). I may, at any rate, report, my lord, that you are a most loyal subject of our queen's, and that you will say not one good word of her rival, your whimsical captive. One of these said whims may take her majesty to the garden. With your permission I will stroll there for awhile, whilst your lordship prepares your answer to my papers. Shrewsbury. My lens is set to focus her at a wise distance. Neither am I so near her as to be under her glamour, nor so far as but to judge her by the noise of an inflamed and scurrilous report. I see her as she isâa princess of high courage, but a woman and a liar. Messenger. All great princes should know the diplomatic art of lying. Our queen can lie! Shrewsbury (aside). Aye, but badly. This queen will lie against her and beat her. Messenger. Nevertheless I would fain see her. I await your summons in the garden. [Exit Messenger, leaving Shrewsbury plunged in thought, and again reading paper. Scene II. âAn apartment at Tutbury Castle. Mary Stuart reclining on a sofa in a loose robe. Enter Mary Beaton, her attendant. Mary Beaton. Your majesty did call? Queen. Yes. I would rise And tire me in my best, I have a boon To ask my lord, my gaoler. Mary Beaton. Which same boon, Being a member of the one true faith (Unlike the heretic churl we parted from, Without much waste of weeping), he will grant, I feel assured, dear madam. Queen. I less sure. Mary Beaton. What! seeing you, sweet madam, plead to him, All tired to conquer better men than he? Queen. Your Scotch and English are a race of churls, Unlike the light French lords; to Shrewsbury I seem no better than this chair or table, (I say this truth in all humility). To him methinks all women seem alike. Mary Beaton (smiling). Yet there be chairs and chairs, and so with tablesâ He knoweth rich from homely furniture, And gold from pewter! Queen (sadly). These are such gloomy, chill, imprison'd days, I sometimes wonder they have left me life Worth counting living! You must wonder too? Mary Beaton. I wonder at nothing now! All wonderment Is dead in me. Your highness's brief years Have been so fill'd with all astonishment. Queen. Ah, not so brief! my night is closing in. Ah, Mary, could we wend to some warm shore Smiling to greet us! I have read such tales Of sweet Italian places by blue seas, I long to seek them! Could we drink in life And great glad sunlight under olive trees Gray, with their gnarled trunks, their dreamy shade, Like vapour meeting skies serene and blue, Which flush to rosier light at eventide Behind the black sharp furthest mountain-ridge, There citrons hang upon the burden'd bough, Or flow'r to waft a challenge of defiance Towards the crowding violets, as jealous Of which should smell the sweetest! Think on this, And then behold yon fest'ring lichens creep Amongst the slimy cresses on that pond, See yon starved robin pecking at a worm Amongst the clinging furrows deep with clay, And listen to the wind that beats the smoke Adown this dismal chimney: yet forsooth They call this spring-tide! All my weary soul Is longing for the South! Mary Beaton. The while I deemed Your heart, dear madam, hungered for the North. Methought your royal spirit sought the shore Of pine-clad Denmark, where Lord Bothwell bides. And yet 'tis cold in Denmark, is it not? There blow methinks the dread north winds of heaven, Let loose like sleuth hounds on their track that flee From slow despair. This had I thought, dear madam. Queen. Ah! I would take my north wind to the South, And hold it to my bosom till its breath Breathed life into me, whilst without the world Thaw'd to the warm midsummer of my love. Oh, Mary, there was never love like thisâ A bold north love, sun-scented with the south! Mary Beaton. Ah! may your highness bask in such a loveâ May it come to you with the crown o' the realm! Queen (sadly). It may come to me with a martyr's crown, Strive not to dupe me who am now no child, My bold north love is o'er, Bothwell is dead! [Weeps. Mary Beaton. Nay, madam, you are gloomy. Have good courage! Queen (continuing). Ah, child, you deem these days have left me shorn Of all my bygone buoyancy of mind? How long, ye saints, must I, Christ's handmaid, wait For freedom or for glory in a world Where these base elements wherefrom I groan Exist not? You will wonder at the change So lately come to one of my proud blood. Doubtless you deem I lose my spirit's fire Stifled amidst the cold, and damp, and squalor Of this our prison-house, wherein the rains Drip thro' the mould'ring ceilings, whilst the winds Rattle the crazy casements, where the owl, The bat-mouse, and the noisome dunghill rat Are fellow-sojourners with Scotland's queen! Mary Beaton. Yet now your highness knows all this is past. Since we are bound ere long to Chartley Manor. Queen. Past! Yea, my transient gleam of sun is past, But not the coming evil of new days! Sometimes I deem my race is doom'd to ill. When have we thriven? 'Twere too long to tell Of plot and counter-plot, risings in arms, Not even like yon chess-board, black with white Alternate, knew my inoffensive years Storm and fine weatherâsorrow, always black; The poor bright squares of happiness so rare Mere white surprises on the growing dark! Mary Beaton. Ah, madam, you are fanciful to-day! Queen. Nay, nay, not fanciful, but truthful, child. Think how I throve amidst a storm of hailâ My mother and the cardinal at war With hydra-headed heresies. Remember How these two struggled to exterminate The hornet-horde of heretics! Remember The man that nail'd the ram's horns on St. Francis, And then the impious Wishartâthought of these Kindles my blood so hot that it could burn them! Mary Beaton. Calm yourself, madam, they were burnt on earth, And now burn on for ever! Queen. Calm is past. Come stormâcome anything save this dead life! Come change, come turmoil! Nay, I hug my wrongs, Since now I hope the near accomplishment Of God's just vengeance on His enemies, And mine, and yours! Ah, can you hear of them Seeming unmoved, as now?âand you a Beaton, Blood of the murder'd cardinal! Mary Beaton. Ah, madam, You seem'd to have forgotten this till now, With half your wrongs, and e'en Lord Bothwell's death. Queen (continuing, excitedly). You deem this crush'd me, childâyea, for awhile Such dealing chill'd my blood, and seemed to sink My mind unto a swoon-like apathy, Killing the queen within me, who became Naught but an ailing woman. This is o'er, And with the first return of health and spring I feel the couchant tiger in my blood Arise refresh'd, as having slept awhile, And thereby gained new suppleness and force: I thirst for vengeance! Let them guard her well, Their queen! And have I written with this hand, Calling her âmy good sister?â She shall rue The day when she held prisoner in her land One of the old Stuart stock! Hast ever seen A pictured semblance of the king of beasts Bound down with cords, which at the under side A little mouse is gnawing with his teeth? Either I dream, or, too elate with hope, I meet my wish too far this side its end; Or elseâ(nay, child, maybe I only dream!)â Some little mouse is gnawing at my chain. Mary Beaton. God grant it, madam, and that he break not his teeth! [Enter Servant.] Servant. Lord Shrewsbury craves permission to speak with your highness. Queen. We wait him. Let him enter. [Enter Lord Shrewsbury.] Shrewsbury (bowing low, but not looking the Queen in the face). Do I find Your majesty restored to health again? Queen (coaxingly). An you would deign to raise your eyes, my lord, Perchance you might observe that this poor face Wears trace of coming summer. These new winds Bringing these moister mornings, fill our lungs Less harshly than that piercing pain of weather Before the rains. 'Twere sweet to wander now, Breathing the scent of May-buds satisfied That thirsted for this rain. Shrewsbury. This may not mean Your majesty would walk abroad to-day? Your majesty who some few days ago Bewail'd yourself, talking of rheumatism, With argues, faintings, water in the bloodâ Deeming these dire distempers all begot Of English damp and English prison fareâ So hath your majesty misnamed the diet With which we strive to flatter, if may be, Your majesty's fine palate, used, no doubt, To Frenchmen's food. We Englishmen are rougher, PerchanceâI do not know, but yet methinks I, standing here, well reach'd my middle age, Could tackle your ten Frenchmen! Queen. Nay, my lord, You ever seem to fly off âhunting hares,â As we who chased the red deer used to say Long since in Scotland, when it chanced some hound, Mistaking passing accident for purpose, Scented the lesser quarry. And, again, Whene'er you have your fling at Frenchmen's fare, At Frenchmen's cut of clothes or cut of beard, We notice that your lady and yourself Will look at us askance. Nay, by the rood! We think, my lord (forgive us for our speech), On one thing only are you two agreedâ To flaunt us for a Frenchwoman! Shrewsbury (coldly). Nay, madam, You surely wrong me. As for Lady Shrewsbury I will not answerânay, I wash my hands Of Lady Shrewsbury! Queen. What! of your own wife! And you a Catholic? Out, out upon you! We needs must school you who are 'neath your rule, My Lord of Shrewsbury! Then, as for Frenchwoman, After the queen's decease (whom God defend), Where lives there in the land one, like ourself, Uniting nearest blood with truest faithâ The one true faithâyour faith, my lord, and mine? Shrewsbury. Nay, madam, these are subjects I eschew! I know my duty to my sovereign lady, And may I know it at a later day If (as some hope who serve your majesty) The crown she wears pass to another's brow; But now I will not parley of such chance. Yet I, who seem to you a blunt, rough man, Have yet some forethought of your highness's weal, And so I would advise you, should you walk Or ride abroad to-day, between the rains, To have a care, and mind you that those watch Your grace's movements who are bound to do it From lealty to their queen, to whom myself Am likewise bounden, thus to do her service, Yet to you, madam, would I, too, be faithful, And so I warn your highness. Queen (to Mary Beaton, aside). Can he mean Those watch for me as some now watch for her, To do me bodily harm? Nay, nay, not thus Would she best clear her kingdom of my claims! Nay! I defy her malice! [Aloud to Lord Shrewsbury. Then my lord Gives his permission that we walk abroad? Shrewsbury. Yes; I am blunt, and so forgive my words. I give permission not of my free will; 'Tis that I have her majesty's commands To deal more leniently with your highness. Of my free will I had not seem'd so kind, Deeming no good can come unto your highness, Of long duration, whilst at liberty To foster madmen's dreams, who make your name A pass-word for their treasons. This will be Unknown e'en to yourself, whilst men may say âThe Queen of Scots can take her walks abroad,â âThe Queen of Scots may mark this sign or that.â Yet, madam, let the Queen of Scots remember The Queen of England hath her at her bidding, And see she proves her worthy of the trust Which makes that queen (for what good, heaven knoweth!) Deal softly with her! I have said my say, I make your highness my obeisance. [Exit. Queen. What think you, Mary, means that exhortation? It somehow seemed half sermon and half threat, And yet it had in it a ring of friendship,â I cannot fathom it. Mary Beaton. He seemed to speak Almost as nurses chide a wilful child, Saying âThou shalt not, or thou shalt repent.â Oh! that your highness should thus suffer wrong To your high queenly dignity! Queen. Hush, child! We have borne deeper wrongs, and it may be Our gaoler is an honest man at heart, The which may bleed for us; or else perchance His lady, like the tiger-cat she is, May have aspersed us to him, who at us Hurls the ill-humour he is forced to hide From her keen eye that rules him. All ends well Seeing our boon is granted, and these feet (So falt'ring now!) may tread, between the rains, Those garden-glades, and these lips breathe the balm For which they thirst, of spring-buds satisfied! [Mary Beaton helps the Queen on with her mantle. The Queen herself, stooping, puts on her shoes. Mary Beaton (in horror). Nay, madam, not the left! the right foot first Let me withdraw it, and thus break the spell! Queen. That would but hinder me. What is the hour? Mary Beaton. Five o' the clock; remember, prithee, madam, The harm that for like foolish act assail'd The Emperor Augustus, for 'tis writâ âAugustus having by oversight Put on his left shoe before his right, Was like to have been slain next day By soldiers mutinying for pay.â Queen. We risk no such mischance, who have no army To mutiny, nor pay to satisfy; So let the shoe stay on, and get thee cloak'd And bonneted to bear me company. Scene III. âA terraced garden with an ivied wall. Shrubs near it, amongst which Walsingham's Messenger conceals himself on hearing the Queen and Mary Beaton. Messenger (aside). A goodly lady, eyes that might have graced The brows of Egypt's queen; a royal air, And such a voice as leads men to their doom. At last these eyes have seen the Queen of Scots, She that hath made such turmoil in the land! Queen (to Mary Beaton). This is the place, here where the bulging buttress Doth seem as though it totter'd. Here, to-day, If friends are lurking near, I shall behold A handful of gray pebbles from the sea Scatter'd amongst the ivy. They are here. Now was I bade to droop in careless wise Over the masonry, as tho' to scan The distant landscape. One will come 'ere long, Who, climbing up the shadow'd side of wall, Will slip into my hanging hand the cyphers, Telling if all goes well. If seen by any, Well, 'tis some yokel who hath made a vow To see the Queen of Scots and touch her hand, For the king's evil. He will act the clown To those who set upon him. You will watch, And at the sound of coming voice or footfall, Trill gently that old song I made in France. Now leave me, Mary. Messenger (aside). Ha! it seems to me I witness some conspiracy. Strange chance! Now to observe and listen. Queen (hearing someone on the other side of the wall, over which she is leaning). Is't a friend? Voice of Babington. A friend who sayeth from his inmost heart, âGod speed the harvest.â Queen. Babington himself! Our page at Sheffield. We had known your face Amongst a thousand! For all service done And doing for us, we desire to thank you. We are alone, so you are free to speak. Babington (showing himself, disguised as a rustic). Madam, my most dread sov'reign and my liege, To this dear moment hath my wingÃ¨d hope Travell'd till now unbless'd. I kneel, abash'd, Before my one anointed queen of queens! [Kneels. Queen. Arise our truest friend, nor kneel to one So fetter'd and abased: in all your land There bides no beggar is as poor as weâ Bereft by sland'rous tongues of honour, crown, (We mourn for honour first), nay crowns, my friendâ Bereft of all we women-folk hold dear. Rise, Babington, nor kneel to such an oneâ Yet could these few poor unconsider'd words Of broken Englishâ(it is hard your tongue)â Tell you but faintly all our thanks to you And those your brave companions, we could speak Indefinitely. Time encroaches, friend, Give us the cyphers. Ah! and not so changed As when our pretty page! [Strokes his cheek. [Babington kisses her hand and gives the cyphers, which the Queen conceals in her sleeve. Queen (scornfully). And so they thought To cage for ever in their cobweb cage A Queen of Scotland and a Queen of France! Babington. Madam, a Queen of Englandâprais'd be God! Some noble hearts beat only to that end. Queen. We thank those noble hearts, and bid them beat Till our sad heart cease beating. There is hope Whilst life thus thro' this somewhile tortured frame Flows without sign of flinching. Fare you well! Babington. Your highness leaves me happiest of slaves. Like Moses, may the glory of my face Illuminate the souls of those who wait. Adieu my dear liege-lady! [Kissing both her hands. Queen. Fare you well! [Mary Beaton is heard singing in the distance, to warn the Queen of approaching footsteps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. â(Some months are supposed to have elapsed since last Act). The oak room at Jerome Bellamy's. Alice and Willoughby in conversation. Willoughby. Oh it is all out! and it is as infernal a plot as ever the Evil One put into the mind of a man to imagine. It has run through the whole of England as swiftly as the distempered blood flows through the veins of one that is bitten of a mad dog, another moment and it had attained the heart. Alice. It is all most terrible! Willoughby. Besides the queen's death and the Spanish invasion, it is discovered that they have held communications as concerning the sacking of the City of London; they had devised to rob some of the richest men in England, to fire the ships, and to cloy all the great ordnanceâand all this to bring back the Pope! If this is their Religio Catholica, 'twere better had they christened it Diabolica. But you, of course, are well informed of all this! Alice. Wherefore am I so well informed? It hath all been to me as some horrible dream! Willoughby. Because (and my heart bleeds when I say to you these words) your own cousin is at the head of this plotâthat Anthony Babington, for whom you gave me this letterâyour mother's nephewâyour cousin but not mine, I thank heaven! Alice (in agitation). Where did you get this letter? Its seal is broken âwho has read it? Willoughby. Four sham freebooters, who tore it from my breast on the night when, you may mind you, you said (laying your hand thus on my leathern jerkin), âPlace it there,â and there it was they found it. I shall never forget that your hand was thereâ Alice. When did this happen? Willoughby. Months ago now, after our last sad meeting. Since then the plot hath been so surging and thickening around us, we have had our hands and minds full, I warrant you. After all they were no freebooters, but some of our queen's party on the look out for traitors. It seems Peter Barton, a servant of Babington's, had turned queen's evidence, and was on the look out, deeming, no doubt, when he came into these parts that, as he was your kinsman, he would be your guest. This ruffian was shot by Mr. Bellingham, my travelling companion, who took him for the robber he seemed, and I had afterwards some trouble in proving their error to those that had hold of me, as, having on me a letter for him, and the darkness somewhat hiding my features, they took my grizzled locks for a wig, and my sturdier frame for borrowed flesh, for it seems he hath many disguises, being sometimes arrayed as a soldier, a rustic, an Abraham-man, or a Tom o' Bedlam, and so would have it until daylight that I was Babington and no other. Alice. And Mr. Bellingham? Willoughby. He was off across the bleak moorland like a roe-deer. One had said he fear'd for his life had he not seem'd hitherto a gallant young gentlemanâ nor since then have I heard of him. Alice. Nor I either; and these men read my letter? Willoughby. These men read your letter, and, throwing it back to me, said it was only from some foolish wench who was sweet on the traitor, tho' they said it proved his treasons without doubt, in that his sweetheart prayed him to desist from them. So this was the man you lov'd!âa traitorâa renegadeâone who would have compassed the queen's death! Alice. Ah cousin, spare me! Willoughby. It was for him that as a thing of naught you set aside the love of an honest manâfor the sake of one whose name will be for ever a slur on his old houseâand a byword for the whole of loyal England to scoff at! Alice. I will not answer you; my lips are sealed. You are speaking at random, knowing no more who is the man I have loved than you know now where is that Babington at whom you are jeering. Willoughby. Ha! I do not know where he is? Am I so far from suspecting his whereabouts? Why, then, am I here? Did I come once more to madden myself with your scorn of my love? Nay! I obeyed but the voice of a stern necessity which bids me search this house in the queen's name. Anthony Babington is in this house. Alice. In this house? Nay, you are speaking, indeed, at random! Willoughby. Thank God if I am, Alice. I would not for worlds that Anthony Babington were found in this house; for if he is here it is that as is suspectedâ your uncle is one of his accomplices. And though, if he leave as my prisoner, he is a doomed man (since out of the loyalty that I owe the queen I will not that he escape), and though you once said to me that whilst he lived you would wed âno other living man,â still, such is the folly of love, Alice, that though I answered then, âWould that he were dead,â I say now, âWould heaven I may not bring him to his death, would heaven I could save him!â Alice (bitterly). And yet you would not that he escape you? Such is the love of a man! Willoughby. Such is the duty of a soldier to his queen. Then he is here? I pray'd this had not been! Alice (excitedly). Ah! now I have it! All is as plain as day. My grandfather's will left me my uncle's heir if I should wed a Protestant and found a family professing the new religion. You are my guardian, my kinsman, and a Protestant to boot, a soldier, and one trusted of the queen. With all this you might hold high junketing in London and at Court had you but the wherewithalâbut this, you have said, will come in marrying me. This is your boasted love; this is why you come to me now, my heart bleeding for my poor kinsman, my playmate, my childhood's friendâand tell me he is doomed to die, that a price is set on his head, and that he is a regicide, a traitor, and a disgrace to his old house! Willoughby. Calm yourself, Alice; you are unjust. [Aside.] Ah, this was then really the man she loved! Alice. You hope for his death! You hope for my uncle's attainder! These two out of your path, and, you have said, âI shall gain two thingsââby which you meant, a rich wife and the death of one you thought she had loved; forby, if my uncle dies, and I am wedded to you, a Protestant, I am his heirâhis heir and your wife, as you think. You think these old elm trees, crowned with their crow colonies, will bow their heads to you and own you for master. You are mistaken. You are blind. You do not know. No, no, never! never! Each sighing tree would seem a wailing ghost to you. All these pictures would scowl at you from under their beetle brows. These creaking wainscots would sound as the grating laughter of fiends. At midnight his white face would haunt you, whilst everything, alive or dead, from roof to basement, from the song of the first sad bird at dawn to the croak of the black rook that comes home last from the fields at eventide, would hiss at you the same words, âAnthony Babington is gone, and it was you that brought him to his death!â [Weeps. Willoughby. Then Babington is here in hiding? And I, with my great love for you, must deal you this blow. Alice. I swear he is not here. He is no more here than your love. I have found the key-note to your love! Willoughby. My poor child, you know not what you are saying. The loyal soldier who weds with the daughter or niece of a traitor hath to swallow much that is not to his liking; though this one who loves her will readily do. If Anthony Babington is found in this house it is true that he is a dead man, and so far out of my way if he is the man who stood between us. But this fact will prove your uncle is of the plot. He will suffer with Babington. His goods will be forfeited to the Crown, and you are a pauper and homeless; and so I say, not for myself but for you, pray Heaven we find no traitors in this house. Alice. I will swear to you, by all that I hold sacred, he is not here! Enter unperceived Jerome Bellamy and Father Harington.] Bellamy (aside to Harington). Did I not say that you may always trust a woman to lie? Willoughby (continuing). I will take your word, cousin Alice; and though my warrant obliges me to search the house and the woods surrounding it, you may be sure I shall in no way abuse me of so undesired an authority. Alice. Thank you, cousin; and I crave your forgiveness if any of my bitter words wounded your kind heart. I have been well-nigh beside myself since this bad news. Willoughby. I will not let this stand between what you would call our friendship, Alice. [Perceiving Bellamy.] Kinsman, I have a sad duty to perform. I hold here a warrant to search your house for some traitors who are known to be harboured in this neighbourhood. They have doubled, like foxes, and you must not marvel if your religion, coupled with your kinship to this Babington, maketh it suspected that he may be here. Bellamy (ironically). Sir, you have but your duty to perform. Go, search every nook and corner of this poor dwelling. See, here are the keys of every chamber, and those that are unlocked you will be free to enter. In one you will find my agÃ¨d mother in her bed, upon whom all these dire tidings have fallen as a bolt from heaven. Spare her gray head as much as you can of what must needs bow it to the dust! This worthy Father [pointing to the priest], who has been for many years my counsellor and spiritual guide, desires that he escape not the humiliations that have been heaped upon others of his cloth. He desires, nay, he demands, that you search him, as also the chamber in which he is lodged. Nay, tear aside his soutane and look that beneath it he doth not wear trunk hose. Mark well the cut of his tonsure. See, he has bared his white hairsâ Willoughby (embarrassed). Nay, cousin, you both wound and embarrass me! âthis is a sad duty. Bellamy (continuing). Here, sir, is my library of study [opens a door to left] âhere where it is my habit to write. Search each paper and document, nay, look well betwixt the leaves of each old book, and see that you examine the fittings of the wainscot. To the left there are situate my kitchens, larders, and outhouses, not forgetting the wood-lofts and hay-ricks, for 'tis a common trick of your conspirators to hide amongst hay or faggots. Here are my serving men and maids who are at present lingering over their ale [opening a door to right]. Look well at each one of them. Rise, varlets, and pull your forelocks to the gentleman who is searching the house in the name of the queen! [Servants discovered at supper. Willoughby (scarcely looking at the servants assembled). You are hard on me, cousin! Alice. Uncle, you are hard on cousin Nicholas, who wishes us no ill! Willoughby. God knows I do not, and I heartily trust my search may prove unsuccessful. Have I your permission to do my sad duty? I search first the house and then the gardens and grounds. Bellamy. Assuredly, sir; and lest it be thought we go but to throw dust in your eyes, neither myself nor any of my family shall accompany you. [Exit Willoughby. [Triumphantly, as soon as he has departed.] Aye, blockhead, go and search among stocks and stones for the man who stood anon but three paces from you! Go into byre and barn, and turn over the straw in the horses' stall. You will not find him. Anthony Babington is here! [Enter Babington, Barnwell, and Donn, disguised as rustics, from room to the right.] Alice (in horror). What, here! Anthony here! Great God, what will become of us! Babington. Thanks to you all for helping us to outwit that short-sighted swashbuckler. These are my two friends, Mr. Robert Barnwell and Mr. Henry Donn; but for you [turning to Bellamy] we had all been in a sorry plight. Alice (in alarm). Back, then, to your place of hiding, for the love of heaven, since you are here! Babington. Not till I have pledged you all in this bumper, and drank the health of our sovereign lady the queen. [Raising glass.] Long live Queen Mary! Willoughby (entering unperceived). Nay, long live Queen Elizabeth! Anthony Babington, Robert Barnwell, and Henry Donn, I arrest you in the name of the queen's majesty! [Aside.] Though would to heaven some other man had the doing of this deed! [Enter soldiers, servants, &amp;c.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âA room in the Tower very early in the morning. Alice and Babington. Alice (sadly). How do we meet? Would heaven I had died, Nor seen you thus! My heart lies dead in me For very sorrow! Babington. All things have an end: So end my dreams. As man must one day die, What matter whether 'tis at chilly Yule Or warm midsummer? 'Tis but as some journey Which fate predestin'd me to undertake A day or two before; years seem but hours To those who gaze mistrustfully at Time, Failing to clip his wings. The happy years, Men say, fly fastest. I, who ne'er have stoop'd To wallow in that paradise of fools Wherein some seem contented, scarcely know The common meaning of that common thing Which men call happiness. I nursed my hopes, And these are fled. What matter when I die? Alice. You are resigned, poor cousin, prais'd be God! May He sustain you to the bitter end. I know you had firm courage and resolve. Babington. These things are only letters strung together, Nor know we wholly of what stuff we are, Until we reach that end of which you speak, Calling it bitter. But whether bitter or sweet, There is a stronger force than firm resolveâ The force that leads the rack'd one to declare Himself a guilty man, whose hands are clean, Or their hands bloody that were once his friends. This force is Pain. And those that best endure First, thought of this, and after, pain itselfâ Stand out the bravest men in history. And yet 'tis not their mental probity They forfeit, as their straining sinews wince Under accumulating torture. See, I dash this hardware vessel to the ground, [Throws earthen platter on the ground. It stands the shock, nor splinters in the fall; Yet dared I try with such a feeble thing As seems some egg-shell brought you over sea, It would be lost to youâin fifty bits. 'Tis but the clay that is not staunch enough, And whose fault, save the potter's? So with usâ The brave soul prison'd in the porcelain shell, Shrinks thro' its agony of fibre and nerve, The better borne by him of stouter frame, E'en were he craven-hearted. Thus it isâ And whose fault save the potter's? Alice. None the less, My dear, dear love that was (I call you thus, Knowing you never may be love of mine), You will not swerve in your fidelity To those that were your friends? Nay, should the rack, Accursed engine! (Ah, can God's just eye Look on and see it?) torture your poor frame, (Too horrid thought!) set your teeth thus, and thus Let your nails gnaw into your clenching palms, Rather than speak! Nay, drag your aching limbs Like our old kinsman rack'd under King Harry,â But do not e'er betray them! Promise me! Babington. But for the parable I made anon, Of hardware and poor porcelain, I would promise. Alice. See, I am made of porcelain, since I fall, And falling, break; and broken, cease to be A thing of any worth! Here, read this letter, And see how I had fallen for your sake, That you might rise the stronger to subdue The powers of evil! [Shows the letter she had written to him. Babington. Ha! you would have gone With me, your evil genius, to perdition? Yes, I believ'd it, and so counted strange Your obstinate refusal, since till then I seemed to lead mankind; I know not wherefore, Nor wholly whither, yet I had a mission, Methinks, to influence the mass of men, So wonder'd at a woman like yourself Saying me nay so stoutly; ne'ertheless You would have gone had I not gone the first. History will know me as a leader of men! Alice (sorrowfully). A leader? a deluder of yourself, Whilst those who lov'd you followed in your track. Yes, Anthony, this had I done for you And love of something that seem'd once like love, Yet heaven will'd it otherwise. Babington (tenderly). Poor child, And so you lov'd me! Alice. What was once my love Methinks I could not help but love a little, Tho' only as a spirit hovers o'er Some memory of earth. Betwixt us two Naught could arise that would not seem a ghost, A guilty shrinking phantom! You are married; How may I serve your wife? Babington. You are an angel, Which, had I known the earlier, man nor devil Had lured me from you! My unhappy wife Knows naught of this, but nursing on her knee Her child so soon left desolate, oft looks, I doubt not, at the noisy ticking clock In the old home in Derbyshire. (The clock That notes weeks, months, and changes of the moon, The which these eyes of mine may note no more!) And listens for a step that cometh not. I have been traitor to her love and yours! Alice. I will go to her, set your mind at rest. And afterwardsâAh, God! it breaks my heart To think of afterwards! [Covers her face with her hands. Babington. You will be friend and comforter to her. And you will whisper to my hapless child Pointing towards the radiance of the sun) âI once knew one who strove to scale blue heaven To grasp some such far glory, and who fell The lower that he strove to climb so high.â Alice. Dare I to look upon the face of one, Your child and yet not mine, some such sad words I'll say to him, so I can school my voice, Remembering his father. Babington. Thank you, Alice. You seem an angel on the earth, and yet Your acts die with you, like mere ashes and dust; Mine will live after me, tho' lamentable, Bearing no blossom, blighted in the bud, Still, men will speak of me. Alice. And this was then, Poor cousin, your high glory, grasping which You fell to earth, that worms might blate of worms. A small ambition! Babington. Nay, I know this nowâ Or partly know itâonce it seem'd good cheer To think that men should name me after death. Blowing my trumpet with fine flourish of praise. But now, I fear me, nothing brings good cheer To deaf gray ashes lying under ground. Alice. Except God's grace. Babington. E'en this comes not to us, As in the memorable days of old Unto the saints. Vainly, in these sad times, We wait the guiding-finger from on high. That faith should live at all, I marvel me. And yet mine flourish'd fresh and green till now. Alice. I pray that it may flourish to the end. Babington. âThe end!â Is this the endâthe bitter end? Alice. Nay, the beginning of a better life. [Sobbing. Babington. Thus this life ends, as other men begin To spin a tangled spider's web of errors, Wherein to trap themselves! My web is wove. New aspirations, new astonishments, New desolation! Alice. Yes, new desolationâ Tho' mostly to the desolate who waitâ Seeing but emptiness where once was life, With hope and promise of long prosp'rous years! Babington. After me, Alice, shall come other men. There will be births and deaths throughout the earth, With constant sound of merry marriage-bells, And solemn-sounding requiems; but these (The ringing in and out of human kind, E'en in the space that should have been my day) I shall not hear. A dead man lying deaf, Or hearing other music! Not for me Will Spring's winds blow, to scatter wantonly White rings of hawthorn blossom on the sward, As Summer glows to meet her! Yet all these Have never seem'd so fair to me as now. Time was, I did not value them enough, And now, time is to leave them. Unto you, And these, farewell! Maybe such things wax small Before God's promise. I shall know ere long, Yet may not come to tell you. Alice. One thing moreâ The letter that you were to write the queen, Suing for pardon? Babington. I have not the heart, The courage, or the cowardice to write it. And then of what avail? Here in the dark, The vision of my blinded intellect Seems quicken'd, like the keen eyes of a cat, To see the things that heretofore were hid. I see for future safety to the realm, The queen must hang me. Alice. Nay, the queen is kind, I hear that what we common-folk consider Her alternations, or of hot or cold, Of kind or cruel, are but heart and sense Waging internal war. She is the child Of one who suffer'd here, upon the block, Not many paces off. The queen is kind. Babington (proudly). How can I grovel in the dust to one Whose death I planned?âof whom but some days past Had I but heard she ceased to live and breathe I had flung up my cap and shouted thus, âLong live Queen Mary!â Alice (alarmed). Nay, nay! not so loud! See, here are, roughly scrawl'd, some few poor words, Written by one who surely is no scholar, But one who'd die to save you. Set your name Here at the end. [Babington makes a movement meaning refusal. Will you be merciless Even to friends? Then Heaven help your foes, So you had pow'r to harm them! Babington. Let me read. [Reads the paper which is handed to him by Alice. This is the original letter of Anthony Babington, though it is only to satisfy the exigencies of the Drama that he is made to sign it at the eleventh hour.âMost gracious Sovereign,âIf either bitter traces, or pensive contrite heart, and doleful sighs of a wretched sinner, might work any pity in your royal breast, I would wring out from my drained eyes as much blood as, in bewraying my dreary tragedy, should lament my fall, and somewhat, no doubt, move you to compassion; but since there is no proportion between the quality of my crime and any humane consideration, show, sweet queen, some miracle on a wretch that lieth prostrate in your prison most grievously bewailing his offenceââ [To Alice.] Nay, do not say, âmost grievously bewailing.â Is not bewailing ample? Alice. Let it stand, âMost grievously bewailing his offence.â Babington (continuing to read). âand imploring such comfort at your anointed hands ââ [To Alice.] âAnointed,â nay, âanointedâ shall not stand. The queen is excommunicate! Alice. Remember That she was crown'd and christen'd in your faith; Nay, some do say it still lurks in her heart. Babington (continuing to read). âas my poor wife's misfortune doth beg, my child's innocency doth crave, my guiltless family doth wish, and my heinous treachery least deserves. So shall your divine mercy make your glory shine far above all princes, as my most horrible practices are most detestable amongst your best subjects; with whom that you may long live and happily govern, I beseech the Mercy-Master to grant for His sweet Son's sake. âYour majesty's unfortunate, because disloyal, subject.â Alice. And now your signature. Gaoler (entering, having heard a shout). What was that shout I heard anon? It sounded strangely like sedition. Moreover, some of the other gentlemen hearing it, have taken up the cry. Rest content, sir, with the evil you have wrought, and let us have no rioting here. Why, the Tower is full of them that have followed your evil counsel! They are coming to us from all parts of England for a lodging. Alice. Good master, this is no new sedition; 'tis but a paper asking the queen's pardon. This gentleman desires that he may sign it. Gaoler. He may sign it, so it is afterwards seen by those in authority. Alice. Oh, it is as open as the day, the whole world may see it. Babington. Alice, you master me, give me the paper; though 'tis but as a last straw to a drowning man. Gaoler. Two other gentlemen have written their confessions. Babington (taking the pen). See then the force of ensample, and how men will follow one after another like a flock of sheep making for a gap in the hedge. I sign, but as I sign I know I am a dead man. Nay, I sign with all the recklessness of one that is dead already. [Signs the paper. Gaoler. Mistress, the time is up, and you remember 'Twas only by a great and special grace You talked with Mr. Babington. Alice (sadly). I know it, And thank the pow'rs that be for such good grace. God bless you, Anthony! Babington. God bless you, Alice! When sick men bless they say their words come true. I am one privileged by fate to count E'en as a sick man very nigh to death.â From this dim border-land I spread my hands Towards the woman that was never mine, And say âGod bless her!â as a dead man speaks, Pale, passionless, the red blood in his veins Frozen to stagnant ice; God gives me grace To pray He bless you, e'en if with another, Some worthier man than I. Once more, farewell! [Alice slowly leaves the prison, in tears, her hands covering her face. Scene II. âThe gates of Greenwich Park.âCitizens, children, peasants, &amp;c., lingering near. [Later in the day. 1st Bystander. The queen is coming. I can hear the music. I have seen many things, but never the queen. 2nd Bystander. Then it is not the queen, since we hear she will have no music to-day. She is altogether as sorry for the executing of these jail-birds as she was for the death of that pretty French gentleman, her last husband that was to be. 3rd Bystander. Nay, they say had he been prettier the queen had been sorrier. He was not pretty enough. 1st Bystander. These young gentlemen are all well-favoured. As they have gone to and fro the Hall at Westminster, I have got so to know their features that I have almost forgotten their heresies. I had as lief not know one that is doomedâmy heart goeth out somehow, to one that I know. 2nd Bystander. Did you hear of the speech of Sir Christopher Hatton, and what he said of the priests and the seminaries? Sir Christopher hath a tongue in his head. 1st Bystander. Oh, you will not work on me to say that they were in the right now. Let us rather hope they were the blackest traitors! Aye, aye, let us damn them in the next world, now that we cannot save them in this! 2nd Bystander. The Queen of Scots will never reign over us now. 1st Bystander. Some say neither will her son. 2nd Bystander (to 1st). What manner of man is the King of Scots, you that have seen him in his own land? 1st Bystander (archly). Hast ever heard of Signor Davie Rizzio? 2nd Bystander. Oh ah! I see your drift! But 'tis his mother gives him his claim. 1st Bystander. I question not his claim. Know you that Davie had a brother Joseph? 2nd Bystander. Better had David borne him more like Joseph! 1st Bystander. Nay, nay, no play on words! This Joseph Rizzio, Sometime a servant of the Duke of Orkney, Told me the King of Scots was like his brother. 3rd Bystander. Well, well, the Queen of Scots was frighten'd for him, And so her child turn'd like him. 1st Bystander. May my wife Be never frighten'd for a base Italian With bandy legs! [Hubbub and shouts in distance. 3rd Bystander. Why, neighbour, thou wert right, The queen is coming. 1st Bystander. What! is that the queen? Her head is much less comely than those that are jingling in my pockets. I had thought her younger. 3rd Bystander. She hath great dignity of carriage nevertheless. 2nd Bystander. Her age telleth on her. 1st Bystander. She is, peradventure, grieving for the traitors. 3rd Bystander. But who is to rule us at her death? 1st Bystander. Oh, the Great Turk for aught I know, with his alcoran. Off with your hat! [Enter Alice, accompanied by Babington's wife, and his child, which she leads by the hand, and Willoughby.] Willoughby. Make way, my good mastersâthese ladies wish to get hearing of her majesty. This is the third day we wait her coming, failing an audience, which is always either denied to us, or we are put off with the cry of âto-morrow.â [They take up their position amongst the first row of people. [Enter Elizabeth, accompanied by ladies, courtiers, Cecil, Walsingham, &amp;c. &amp;c.] Elizabeth (hearing distant shouts). Why shout those blockheads, as in exultation? Cecil. They shout because we overcome a foe. Because a many-jointed snake in the grass Is crush'd beneath your majesty's firm heel, As erst the dragon by our own St. Georgeâ And hence they shout. Elizabeth. Nay, weep with poor St. George, For living in a land so rife with dragons! Where may another lurk, all crouched to spring? Alice (advancing suddenly). My most dread sov'reign, deign to read this letter. A Courtier (starting). Why, girl, you fling upon her majesty, Dropping from nowhere, you astonish us. Not thus the fashion to approach a queen. Give first your letter to some officer. Hast heard of mediators? A high prince Takes nothing thus raw-handed from the clutch Of such a sudden apparition! [Aside.] Zounds! Why, had she been the Pope or Antichrist, She had not scared me more! The girl is comely. This comes of Cecil's foolish hurlyburlies Of jointed snakes and dragons! [To Alice.] Say your business? Elizabeth. What is it? Nay, I guess before I see! Courtier. Your majesty's keen sense dives down the well, Unearthing squeamish truth, who hides her head, Like your old ostrich that has eaten nails, And deems the world too blind to make a note Of her tail feathers! Elizabeth. Ha! Well said, well said! Tho', like your ostrich, somewhat long of limb And scant of feathers! Now your business, girlâ That well-thumbed paper in your pretty hand (The girl is pretty) is a supplication For pardon of these Catholics? Alice. It is, My most dread sov'reign! Foremost is my pray'r For Mr. Babington. This is his child! [Thrusting forward the child. Elizabeth. A pretty boy. Courtier (aside). Why is it that the spawn Of traitors, like the slimy eggs of serpents, Ever accumulates and multiplies, Whilst God's anointedâthe high princes of earth, Go virgin, or are barren, or give birth To one poor addled egg? [Aloud.] A pretty boy. Alice (continuing). Ah, madam! let your merciful renown Spread over sea, to far-off continents! Let him be foremost of an embassage To blow the clarions sounding forth your praise O'er that new land discover'd in the westâ But only let him live, tho' far away, To bless your name! [Kneels to the Queen. Elizabeth (compassionately). You are his wife, poor girl. See, Walsingham, this is a traitor's wifeâ A traitor âart and part,â are those the words? A traitor found red-handed in the fact, Yet not so very terrible, what say you? Walsingham (coldly). She hath the pity of the realm with mineâ Elizabeth. Which serves her little. Add our own thereto, How will it serve her? Alice (imploringly). Madam, add to this One little stroke of your anointed hand. Give him at least his life, he is so young! Elizabeth (affected). Thou art a right good pleader. Walsingham (sternly). Hark you, madam, I pity this poor lady, ne'ertheless This man must die. Cecil. To spare him is to spare The other Papists that are doom'd to death. He is the ringleader, the law demands Her lord shall die! We spare not such as he. Elizabeth. Go to, my lord! we follow our own bent, And spare or spare not, as it seems us good. Preach you unto some other, not the Queen! God's mercy, sirs! Alice. Ah, he is not my lord, He is my cousin only and my friend. This lady is his wife. [Pointing to Mrs. Babington. Elizabeth. Alas, poor lady! Cecil (to Mrs. Babington). You, madam, being wedded to a traitor, One that was sworn to compass the queen's death, Should bear such sorrow silently. Time was When traitors' wives did perish with their husbands, And time may be again, it being known They do consort with them and keep their companyâ And those that keep the company of traitors Cannot go unsuspected. Be content To know you do not die with Mr. Babington. Mrs. Babington. Would I could die with him, my dear, dear husband! [Covers her face and weeps. Recovering herself. This, his good cousin, who hath hitherto Spoken for my cause only, needs a wordâ For her own flesh and blood, one Jerome Bellamy, Is likewise of the number doom'd to die. He is no ringleader, and only suffers For having known the rest and harbour'd them. Methinks I am as treasonable as he. Walsingham. Said I not so? To spare this Babington Will be to spare a whole hot-bed of traitors! Elizabeth. 'Tis over late to plead. We will consider. Alice. We strove to reach your grace's ear before, Yet were denied. Willoughby (leading Alice away from the Queen). Ah, cousin, we have done! We can but vex by importunity. Pray heaven we be not now too late to plead! Yet if we be, and you left desolate, Remember what I have of home is yours. My mother will be mother too to you. I say this come what may. Alice (weeping). Say it not nowâ It is too soon! Willoughby. Yet did I wait till after I could not speak. Your heart, new-wrung with grief, Would harden to me, so I say my say; Nor hope for aught save that you have the grace To grant my boon by taking what small good I have to offer. Alice. You are passing kind Good cousin. I deserve and hope for nothing. Willoughby. There is an inner mid-heart sanctuary, Whereof the walls are stouter than the Tower's, Built danger-proof, love's holiest of holies, And you have enter'd there. Remember this. Alice. I do remember, and I thank you for it. God grant the queen will show her mercy to us! [Sounds of artillery heard in the distance mingled with the ringing of bells.] Elizabeth (listening). What means yon booming thunder? Walsingham (advancing). It means that now, at this hour, the conspiracy directed against the person of your most sacred majesty is at an end, and that John Ballard, Anthony Babington, John Savage, Robert Barnwell, Chidiock Titchborne, Charles Tilney, and Edward Abington, after having been drawn on hurdles from the Tower to the place of their suffering in St. Giles's Fields, have been hanged and quartered while they were yet quick. So perish all the enemies of the queen! [Mrs. Babington faints; Willoughby supports her. Queen (shuddering). Oh, horrible! this shall not be again! Cecil, Walsingham, and Courtiers. So perish all the queen's enemies! Voices of the People. God save the queen! [Men pass amongst the people carrying trays with flagons of ale, wine, &amp;c.] A Citizen (to Willoughby). Come, drink a glass with us, good citizen! Here's to the oversetting of our foes. Willoughby. I cannot drink; methinks the drink would choke me. Make way for these ladies. [Endeavouring to pass out of crowd. Citizen. Oh, it is not a strong liquorânone of your Spanish heresies. But, maybe, you are a Papist? Willoughby. Nay, give me a glass then. [Drinks.] Yea, so perish all the queen's enemies! Yet, my good sirs, if I drink not this toast with altogether a cheerful countenance, it is that these ladies knew some of these gentlemen. Some of them just done to death had been known to them for many years, nay, I knew them myself, also; therefore I will sayâSo perish all the enemies of the queen's majesty! But God grant that amongst them there be none of our own true friends! [Curtain falls.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Back to the common things of ev'ry dayâ The dull prosaic Present with its cares!â The curtain falls on this imperfect play, The actors reassume what dress was theirs Ere yet they donned the doublet and trunk hose Of good Queen Bess's reign! We live once more In days that seem too far removed from those Bright days of chivalry, when patriots swore Rash oaths for what they deemed their country's good, Fired by a faith our placid souls ignore. Where are the eager pulsings of the blood, Those noble aspirations, which of yore Banded together to some futile end, The flower of English youth, who dared disgrace And cruel death, and perish'd friend with friend, In their fresh years of manhood? Nay!â(efface From out your minds the thought, or else extol Our growing wealth and commerce in its stead)â Gone are those high ambitions of the soul! The golden days of chivalry are dead! Thus have I heard some Englishmen lament, Who deemed themselves elected to declaim Against the Present, with the discontent Of souls appointed to despise and blame. Yet 'tis but just these favoured few should say (Betwixt their carping): 'Neath a peaceful reign We dwell and draw our breath, nor dread to-day Fall'n France, staunch Scotland, or disjointed Spain; For us no ghastly scaffold draped in black, Uprises like a spectre to affright; Whilst halter, hurdle, quart'ring-knife, and rack Have languish'd under liberty and light, Till thought of them is as of clouds that lower After the night is past when storms have been, That cede to sun. And I have seen the Tow'r, (Guest of a guardsman of sweet seventeen, Who asked me there to tea,) yet smiled beneath That gloomy pile, as heedless of their fate Who once, predestin'd to a horrid death, Defiled despairing, through the Traitors' Gate. Nor did my pulses falter as I turn'd From time to time to view with bated breath Some record of bold spirits that had burn'd Their moth-wings at the altar of their faith. He, smoking carelessly the while, forgot The brave Sir Walter, with his outspread cloak Before the Virgin Queen, whose name should not Go unremember'd of the ones who smoke The fragrant weed that comforts their curl'd heads (The which he brought us ere he left his own Some few short paces hence). And yet he treadsâ That beardless warrior, who hath never known, As yet, the taste of blood, the clash of armsâ As though these names said nothing to his soul. Yes, gone their vain ambitions, their alarms Still'd with those legions that, as ages roll, Are garner'd 'neath the sweeping scythe of Time, Leaving us transient sojourners to mark Some graven coat-of-arms, or pious rhyme Such as I mark'd that day! Yet tho' so dark The blot that fell their coat-of-arms upon Who swore to kill the queen in days of yore (When Titchborne, Tilney, Ballard, Babington, Like kites transfix'd against a granary door, Suffer'd to scare their fellows), who may say What these had wrought beneath a brighter star? Or what deserving impulse turn'd astray Divides the thing we were from what we are? Then let us honour what they counted good, Nor blame the zeal we may not understand; Nor, loathing, shrink from names that might have stood As high as any in our English land, For worth and courage hitherto unstain'd, These hang their heads, and suppliant, meet our view, Before the bar of history arraigned, And asking pity, win our pardon too. Yet bless these days if men have learnt at last, The good of nations makes the good of kings; Whilst Ignorance and Bigotry âare cast, As weeds, upon the dunghill of dead things.â âSongs before Sunrise,â p. 24.</field>
