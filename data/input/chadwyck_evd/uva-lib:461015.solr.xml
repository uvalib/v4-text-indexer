      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Colombe of Ravestein, Duchess of Juliers and Cleves. Sabyne, Adolf, her attendants. Guibert, Gaucelme, Maufroy, Clugnet, courtiers. Valence, advocate of Cleves. Prince Berthold, claimant of the Duchy. Melchior, his confidant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Place.âThe Palace at Juliers. Time, 16?.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. MORNING. Scene.âA corridor leading to the Audience-chamber. Gaucelme, Clugnet, Maufroy and other Courtiers round Guibert, who is silently reading a paper: as he drops it at the endâ Guibert. That this should be her birthday; and the day We all invested her, twelve months ago, As the late Duke's true heiress and our liege; And that this also must become the day . . . Oh, miserable lady! 1st Courtier. Ay, indeed? 2nd Courtier. Well, Guibert? 3rd Courtier. But your news, my friend, your news! The sooner, friend, one learns Prince Berthold's pleasure, The better for us all: how writes the Prince? Give me! I'll read it for the common good. Guibert. In time, sir,âbut till time comes, pardon me! Our old Duke just disclosed his child's retreat, Declared her true succession to his rule, And died: this birthday was the day, last year, We convoyed her from Castle Ravesteinâ That sleeps out trustfully its extreme age On the Meuse' quiet bank, where she lived queen Over the water-buds,âto Juliers' court With joy and bustle. Here again we stand; Sir Gaucelme's buckle's constant to his cap: To-day's much such another sunny day! Gaucelme. Come, Guibert, this outgrows a jest, I think! You're hardly such a novice as to need The lesson, you pretend. Guibert. What lesson, sir? That everybody, if he'd thrive at court, Should, first and last of all, look to himself? Why, no: and therefore with your good example, (âHo, Master Adolf!)âto myself I'll look. Enter Adolf. Guibert. The Prince's letter; why, of all men else, Comes it to me? Adolf. By virtue of your place, Sir Guibert! 'T was the Prince's express charge, His envoy told us, that the missive there Should only reach our lady by the hand Of whosoever held your place. Guibert. Enough! [Adolf retires Then, gentles, who'll accept a certain poor Indifferently honourable place, My friends, I make no doubt, have gnashed their teeth At leisure minutes these half-dozen years, To find me never in the mood to quit? Who asks may have it, with my blessing, andâ This to present our lady. Who'll accept? You,âyou,âyou? There it lies, and may, for me! Maufroy [a youth, picking up the paper, reads aloud]. âPrince Berthold, proved by titles following âUndoubted Lord of Juliers, comes this day âTo claim his own, with licence from the Pope, âThe Emperor, the Kings of Spain and Franceâ . . . Gaucelme. Sufficient âtitles following,â I judge! Don't read another! Well,ââto claim his own?â Maufroy. ââAnd take possession of the Duchy held âSince twelve months, to the true heir's prejudice, âByâ . . . Colombe, Juliers' mistress, so she thinks, And Ravestein's mere lady, as we find. Who wants the place and paper? Guibert's right. I hope to climb a little in the world,â I'd push my fortunes,âbut, no more than he, Could tell her on this happy day of days, That, save the nosegay in her hand, perhaps, There's nothing left to call her own. Sir Clugnet, You famish for promotion; what say you? Clugnet [an old man]. To give this letter were a sort, I take it, Of service: services ask recompense: What kind of corner may be Ravestein? Guibert. The castle? Oh, you'd share her fortunes? Good! Three walls stand upright, full as good as four, With no such bad remainder of a roof. Clugnet. Oh,âbut the town? Guibert. Five houses, fifteen huts; A church whereto was once a spire, 't is judged; And half a dyke, except in time of thaw. Clugnet. Still, there's some revenue? Guibert. Else Heaven forfend! You hang a beacon out, should fogs increase; So, when the Autumn floats of pine-wood steer Safe'mid the white confusion, thanks to you, Their grateful raftsman flings a guilder in; âThat's if he mean to pass your way next time. Clugnet. If not? Guibert. Hang guilders, then! He blesses you. Clugnet. What man do you suppose me? Keep your paper! And, let me say, it shows no handsome spirit To dally with misfortune: keep your place! Gaucelme. Some one must tell her. Guibert. Some one may: you may! Gaucelme. Sir Guibert, 't is no trifle turns me sick Of court-hypocrisy at years like mine, But this goes near it. Where's there news at all? Who'll have the face, for instance, to affirm He never heard, e'en while we crowned the girl, That Juliers' tenure was by Salic law; That one, confessed her father's cousin's child, And, she away, indisputable heir, Against our choice protesting and the Duke's, Claimed Juliers?ânor, as he preferred his claim, That first this, then another potentate, Inclined to its allowance?âI or you, Or any one except the lady's self? Oh, it had been the direst cruelty To break the business to her! Things might change: At all events, we'd see next masque at end, Next mummery over first: and so the edge Was taken off sharp tidings as they came, Till here's the Prince upon us, and there's she âWreathing her hair, a song between her lips, With just the faintest notion possible That some such claimant earns a livelihood About the world, by feigning grievancesâ Few pay the story of, but grudge its price, And fewer listen to, a second time. Your method proves a failure; now try mine! And, since this must be carried . . . Guibert [snatching the paper from him]. By your leave! Your zeal transports you! 'T will not serve the Prince So much as you expect, this course you'd take. If she leaves quietly her palace,âwell; But if she died upon its threshold,âno: He'd have the trouble of removing her. Come, gentles, we're allâwhat the devil knows! You, Gaucelme, won't lose character, beside: You broke your father's heart superiorly To gather his successionânever blush! You're from my province, and, be comforted, They tell of it with wonder to this day. You can afford to let your talent sleep. We'll take the very worst supposed, as true: There, the old Duke knew, when he hid his child Among the river-flowers at Ravestein, With whom the right lay! Call the Prince our Duke! There, she's no Duchess, she's no anything More than a young maid with the bluest eyes: And now, sirs, we'll not break this young maid's heart Coolly as Gaucelme could and would! No haste! His talent's full-blown, ours but in the bud: We'll not advance to his perfection yetâ Will we, Sir Maufroy? See, I've ruined Maufroy For ever as a courtier! Gaucelme. Here's a coil! And, count us, will you? Count its residue, This boasted convoy, this day last year's crowd! A birthday, too, a gratulation day! I'm dumb: bid that keep silence! Maufroy and others. Eh, Sir Guibert? He's right: that does say something: that's bare truth. Tenâtwelve, I make: a perilous dropping off! Guibert. Poohâis it audience hour? The vestibule Swarms too, I wager, with the common sort That want our privilege of entry here. Gaucelme. Adolf! [Re-enter Adolf.] Who's outside? Guibert. Oh, your looks suffice! Nobody waiting? Maufroy [looking through the door-folds]. Scarce our number! Guibert. 'Sdeath! Nothing to beg for, to complain about? It can't be! Ill news spreads, but not so fast As thus to frighten all the world! Gaucelme. The world Lives out of doors, sirânot with you and me By presence-chamber porches, state-room stairs, Wherever warmth's perpetual: outside's free To every wind from every compass-point And who may get nipped needs be weather-wise. The Prince comes and the lady's People go; The snow-goose settles down, the swallows fleeâ Why should they wait for winter-time? 'T is instinct. Don't you feel somewhat chilly? Guibert. That's their craft? And last year's crowders-round and criers-forth That strewed the garlands, overarched the roads, Lighted the bonfires, sang the loyal songs! Well 't is my comfort, you could never call me The People's Friend! The People keep their wordâ I keep my place: don't doubt I 'll entertain The People when the Prince comes, and the People Are talked of! Then, their speechesâno one tongue Found respite, not a pen had holiday âFor they wrote, too, as well as spoke, these knaves! Now see: we tax and tithe them, pill and poll, They wince and fret enough, but pay they must âWe manage that,âso, pay with a good grace They might as well, it costs so little more. But when we've done with taxes, meet folk next Outside the toll-booth and the rating-place, In publicâthere they have us if they will, We're at their mercy after that, you see! For one tax not ten devils could extortâ Over and above necessity, a grace; This prompt disbosoming of love, to witâ Their vine-leaf wrappage of our tribute penny, And crowding attestation, all works well. Yet this precisely do they thrust on us! These cappings quick, these crook-and-cringings low, Hand to the heart, and forehead to the knee, With grin that shuts the eyes and opes the mouthâ So tender they their love; and, tender made, Go home to curse us, the first doit we ask. As if their souls were any longer theirs! As if they had not given ample warrant To who should clap a collar on their neck, Rings in their nose, a goad to either flank, And take them for the brute they boast themselves! Stayâthere's a bustle at the outer doorâ And somebody entreating . . . that's my name! Adolf,âI heard my name! Adolf. 'T was probably The suitor. Guibert. Oh, there is one? Adolf. With a suit He'd fain enforce in person. Guibert. The good heart âAnd the great fool! Just ope the mid-door's fold Is that a lappet of his cloak, I see? Adolf. If it bear plenteous sign of travel . . . ay, The very cloak my comrades tore! Guibert. Why tore? Adolf. He seeks the Duchess' presence in that trim: Since daybreak, was he posted hereabouts Lest he should miss the moment. Guibert. Where's he now? Adolf. Gone for a minute possibly, not more: They have ado enough to thrust him back. Guibert. Ayâbut my name, I caught? Adolf. Oh, sirâhe said âWhat was it?âYou had known him formerly, And, he believed, would help him did you guess He waited now; you promised him as much: The old plea! 'Faith, he's back,ârenews the charge! Speaking at the door.] So long as the man parleys, peace outsideâ Nor be too ready with your halberts, there! Gaucelme. My horse bespattered, as he blocked the path A thin sour man, not unlike somebody. Adolf. He holds a paper in his breast, whereon He glances when his cheeks flush and his brow At each repulseâ Gaucelme. I noticed he'd a brow. Adolf. So glancing, he grows calmer, leans awhile Over the balustrade, adjusts his dress, And presently turns round, quiet again, With some new pretext for admittance.âBack! [To Guibert.]âSir, he has seen you! Now cross halberts! Haâ Pascal is prostrateâthere lies Fabian too! No passage! Whither would the madman press? Close the doors quick on me! Guibert. Too late! He's here. Enter, hastily and with discomposed dress, Valence. Valence. Sir Guibert, will you help me?âme, that come Charged by your townsmen, all who starve at Cleves, To represent their heights and depths of woe Before our Duchess and obtain relief! Such errands barricade such doors, it seems: But not a common hindrance drives me back On all the sad yet hopeful faces, lit With hope for the first time, which sent me forth. Cleves, speak for me! Cleves' men and women, speak! Who followed meâyour strongestâmany a mile That I might go the fresher from their ranks, âWho sitâyour weakestâby the city gates, To take me fuller of what news I bring As I returnâfor I must needs return! âCan I? 'T were hard, no listener for their wrongs, To turn them back upon the old despairâ Harder, Sir Guibert, than imploring thusâ So, I doâany way you pleaseâimplore! If you . . . but how should you remember Cleves? Yet they of Cleves remember you so well! Ay, comment on each trait of you they keep, Your words and deeds caught up at second hand,â Proud, I believe, at bottom of their hearts, O' the very levity and recklessness Which only prove that you forget their wrongs. Cleves, the grand town, whose men and women starve, Is Cleves forgotten? Then, remember me! You promised me that you would help me once, For other purpose: will you keep your word? Guibert. And who may you be, friend? Valence. Valence of Cleves. Guibert. Valence of . . . not the advocate of Cleves, I owed my whole estate to, three years back? Ay, well may you keep silence! Why, my lords, You've heard, I'm sure, how, Pentecost three years, I was so nearly ousted of my land By some knave's-pretextâ(eh? when you refused me Your ugly daughter, Clugnet!)âand you've heard How I recovered it by miracle â(When I refused her!) Here's the very friend, âValence of Cleves, all parties have to thank! Nay, Valence, this procedure's vile in you! I'm no more grateful than a courtier should, But politic am IâI bear a brain, Can cast about a little, might require Your services a second time. I tried To tempt you with advancement here to court ââNo!ââwell, for curiosity at least To view our life hereââNo!ââour Duchess, then,â A pretty woman's worth some pains to see, Nor is she spoiled, I take it, if a crown Complete the forehead pale and tresses pure . . . Valence. Our city trusted me its miseries, And I am come. Guibert. So much for taste! But âcome,ââ So may you be, for anything I know, To beg the Pope's cross, or Sir Clugnet's daughter, And with an equal chance you get all three. If it was ever worth your while to come, Was not the proper way worth finding too? Valence. Straight to the palace-portal, sir, I cameâ Guibert. âAnd said?â Valence. âThat I had brought the miseries Of a whole city to relieve. Guibert. âWhich saying Won your admittance? You saw me, indeed, And here, no doubt, you stand: as certainly, My intervention, I shall not dispute, Procures you audience; which, if I procure,â That paper's closely writtenâby Saint Paul, Here flock the Wrongs, follow the Remedies, Chapter and verse, One, Two, A, B and C! Perhaps you'd enter, make a reverence, And launch these âmiseriesâ from first to last? Valence. How should they let me pause or turn aside? Gaucelme [to Valence]. My worthy sir, one question! You've come straight From Cleves, you tell us: heard you any talk At Cleves about our lady? Valence. Much. Gaucelme. And what? Valence. Her wish was to redress all wrongs she knew. Gaucelme. That, you believed? Valence. You see me, sir! Gaucelme. âNor stopped Upon the road from Cleves to Juliers here, For anyârumours you might find afloat? Valence. I had my townsmen's wrongs to busy me. Gaucelme. This is the lady's birthday, do you know? âHer day of pleasure? Valence. âThat the great, I know, For pleasure born, should still be on the watch To exclude pleasure when a duty offers: Even as, for duty born, the lowly too May ever snatch a pleasure if in reach: Both will have plenty of their birthright, sir! Gaucelme [aside to Guibert]. Sir Guibert, here's your man! No scruples nowâ You'll never find his like! Time presses hard. I've seen your drift and Adolf's too, this while, But you can't keep the hour of audience back Much longer, and at noon the Prince arrives. [Pointing to Valence.] Entrust him with itâfool no chance away! Guibert. Him? Gaucelme. âWith the missive! What's the man to her? Guibert. No bad thought! Yet, 't is yours, who ever played The tempting serpent: else't were no bad thought! I shouldâand doâmistrust it for your sake, Or else . . . Enter an Official who communicates with Adolf. Adolf. The Duchess will receive the court. Guibert. Give us a moment, Adolf! Valence, friend, I'll help you. We of the service, you're to mark, Have special entry, while the herd . . . the folk Outside, get access through our help alone; âWell, it is so, was so, and I suppose So ever will be: your natural lot is, therefore, To wait your turn and opportunity, And probably miss both. Now, I engage To set you, here and in a minute's space, Before the lady, with full leave to plead Chapter and verse, and A, and B, and C, To heart's content. Valence. I grieve that I must ask,â This being, yourself admit, the custom here,â To what the price of such a favour mounts? Guibert. Just so! You're not without a courtier's tact. Little at court, as your quick instinct prompts, Do such as we without a recompense. Valence. Yours is?â Guibert. A trifle: here's a document 'T is some one's duty to present her Graceâ I say, not mineâthese say, not theirsâsuch points Have weight at court. Will you relieve us all And take it? Just say, âI am bidden lay âThis paper at the Duchess' feet!â Valence. No more? I thank you, sir! Adolf. Her Grace receives the court. Guibert [aside]. Now, sursum corda, quoth the mass-priest! Doâ Whoever's my kind saint, do let alone These pushings to and fro, and pullings back; Peaceably let me hang o' the devil's arm The downward path, if you can't pluck me off Completely! Let me live quite his, or yours! [The Courtiers begin to range themselves, and move toward the door. After me, Valence! So, our famous Cleves Lacks bread? Yet don't we gallants buy their lace? And dear enoughâit beggars me, I know, To keep my very gloves fringed properly. This, Valence, is our Great State Hall you cross; Yon grey urn's veritable marcasite, The Pope's gift: and those salvers testify The Emperor. Presently you'll set your foot . . . But you don't speak, friend Valence! Valence. I shall speak. Gaucelme [aside to Guibert.] Guibertâit were no such ungraceful thing If you and I, at first, seemed horror-struck With the bad news. Look here, what you shall do Suppose you, first, clap hand to sword and cry âYield strangers our allegiance? First I'll perish âBeside your Grace!ââand so give me the cue To . . . Guibert. âClap your hand to note-book and jot down That to regale the Prince with? I conceive. [To Valence.] Do, Valence, speak, or I shall half suspect You're plotting to supplant us, me the first, I' the lady's favour! Is't the grand harangue You mean to make, that thus engrosses you? âWhich of her virtues you'll apostrophize? Or is't the fashion you aspire to start, Of that close-curled, not unbecoming hair? Or what else ponder you? Valence. My townsmen's wrongs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. NOON. Scene.âThe Presence-chamber. The Duchess and Sabyne. The Duchess. Announce that I am ready for the court! Sabyne. 'T is scarcely audience-hour, I think; your Grace May best consult your own relief, no doubt, And shun the crowd: but few can have arrived. The Duchess. Let those not yet arrived, then, keep away! 'T was me, this day last year at Ravestein, You hurried. It has been full time, beside, This half-hour. Do you hesitate? Sabyne. Forgive me! The Duchess. Stay, Sabyne; let me hasten to make sure Of one true thanker: here with you begins My audience, claim you first its privilege! It is my birth's event they celebrate: You need not wish me more such happy days, Butâask some favour! Have you none to ask? Has Adolf none, then? this was far from least Of much I waited for impatiently, Assure yourself! It seemed so natural Your gift, beside this bunch of river-bells, Should be the power and leave of doing good To you, and greater pleasure to myself. You ask my leave to-day to marry Adolf? The rest is my concern. Sabyne. Your Grace is ever Our lady of dear Ravestein,âbut, for Adolf . . . The Duchess. âButâ? You have not, sure, changed in your regard And purpose towards him? Sabyne. We change? The Duchess. Well then? Well? Sabyne. How could we two be happy, and, most like, Leave Juliers, whenâwhen . . . but 't is audience-time! The Duchess. âWhen, if you left me, I were left indeed!â Would you subjoin that?âBid the court approach! âWhy should we play thus with each other, Sabyne? Do I not know, if courtiers prove remiss, If friends detain me, and get blame for it, There is a cause? Of last year's fervid throng Scarce one half comes now. Sabyne [aside]. One half? No, alas! The Duchess. So can the mere suspicion of a cloud Over my fortunes, strike each loyal heart. They've heard of this Prince Berthold; and, forsooth, Some foolish arrogant pretence he makes, May grow more foolish and more arrogant, They please to apprehend! I thank their love. Admit them! Sabyne [aside]. How much has she really learned? The Duchess. Surely, whoever's absent, Tristan waits? âOr at least Romuald, whom my father raised From nothingâcome, he's faithful to me, come! (Sabyne, I should but be the prouderâyes, The fitter to comport myself aright) Not Romuald? Xavierâwhat said he to that? For Xavier hates a parasite, I know! [Sabyne goes out. The Duchess. Well, sunshine's everywhere, and summer too. Next year 't is the old place again, perhapsâ The water-breeze again, the birds again. âIt cannot be! It is too late to be! What part had I, or choice in all of it? Hither they brought me; I had not to think Nor care, concern myself with doing good Or ill, my task was justâto live,âto live, And, answering ends there was no need explain, To render Juliers happyâso they said. All could not have been falsehood: some was love, And wonder and obedience. I did all They looked for: why then cease to do it now? Yet this is to be calmly set aside, Andâere next birthday's dawn, for aught I know, Things change, a claimant may arrive, and I . . . It cannot nor it shall not be! His right? Well then, he has the right, and I have not, âBut who bade all of you surround my life And close its growth up with your ducal crown Which, plucked off rudely, leaves me perishing? I could have been like one of you,âloved, hoped, Feared, lived and died like one of youâbut you Would take that life away and give me this, And I will keep this! I will face you! Come! Enter the Courtiers and Valence. The Courtiers. Many such happy mornings to your Grace! The Duchess [aside, as they pay their devoir]. The same words, the same faces,âthe same love! I have been overfearful. These are few; But these, at least, stand firmly: these are mine. As many come as may; and if no more, 'T is that these few sufficeâthey do suffice! What succour may not next year bring me? Plainly, I feared too soon. [To the Courtiers.] I thank you, sirs: all thanks! Valence [aside, as the Duchess passes from one group to another, conversing]. 'T is sheâthe vision this day last year brought, When, for a golden moment at our Cleves, She tarried in her progress hither. Cleves Chose me to speak its welcome, and I spoke âNot that she could have noted the recluse âUngainly, old before his timeâwho gazed. Well, Heaven's gifts are not wasted, and that gaze Kept, and shall keep me to the end, her own! She was above itâbut so would not sink My gaze to earth! The People caught it, hersâ Thenceforward, mine; but thus entirely mine, Who shall affirm, had she not raised my soul Ere she retired and left meâthem? She turnsâ There's all her wondrous face at once! The ground Reels and . . . [suddenly occupying himself with his paper] These wrongs of theirs I have to plead! The Duchess [to the Courtiers]. Nay, compliment enough! and kindness' self Should pause before it wish me more such years. 'T was fortunate that thus, ere youth escaped, I tasted life's pure pleasureâone such, pure, Is worth a thousand, mixedâand youth's for pleasure: Mine is received; let my age pay for it. Gaucelme. So, pay, and pleasure paid for, thinks your Grace, Should never go together? Guibert. How, Sir Gaucelme? Hurry one's feast down unenjoyingly At the snatched breathing-intervals of work? As good you saved it till the dull day's-end When, stiff and sleepy, appetite is gone. Eat first, then work upon the strength of food! The Duchess. True: you enable me to risk my future, By giving me a past beyond recall. I lived, a girl, one happy leisure year: Let me endeavour to be the Duchess now! And so,âwhat news, Sir Guibert, spoke you of? [As they advance a little, and Guibert speaksâ âThat gentleman? Valence [aside]. I feel her eyes on me. Guibert [to Valence]. The Duchess, sir, inclines to hear your suit. Advance! He is from Cleves. Valence [coming forward. Aside]. Their wrongsâtheir wrongs! The Duchess. And you, sir, are from Cleves? How fresh in mind, The hour or two I passed at queenly Cleves! She entertained me bravely, but the best Of her good pageant seemed its standers-by With insuppressive joy on every face! What says my ancient famous happy Cleves? Valence. Take the truth, ladyâyou are made for truth! So think my friends: nor do they less deserve The having you to take it, you shall think, When you know allânay, when you only know How, on that day you recollect at Cleves, When the poor acquiescing multitude Who thrust themselves with all their woes apart Into unnoticed corners, that the few, Their means sufficed to muster trappings for, Might fill the foreground, occupy your sight With joyous faces fit to bear away And boast of as a sample of all Cleves âHow, when to daylight these crept out once more, Clutching, unconscious, each his empty rags Whence the scant coin, which had not half bought bread, That morn he shook forth, counted piece by piece, And, well-advisedly, on perfumes spent them To burn, or flowers to strew, before your path âHow, when the golden flood of music and bliss Ebbed, as their moon retreated, and again Left the sharp black-point rocks of misery bare âThen I, their friend, had only to suggest âSaw she the horror as she saw the pomp!â And as one man they cried âHe speaks the truth: âShow her the horror! Take from our own mouths âOur wrongs and show them, she will see them too!â This they cried, lady! I have brought the wrongs. The Duchess. Wrongs? Cleves has wrongsâapparent now and thus? I thank you! In that paper? Give it me! Valence. (There, Cleves!) In this! (What did I promise, Cleves?) Our weavers, clothiers, spinners are reduced Since . . . Oh, I crave your pardon! I forget I buy the privilege of this approach, And promptly would discharge my debt. I lay This paper humbly at the Duchess' feet. [Presenting Guibert's paper. Guibert. Stay! for the present . . . The Duchess. Stay, sir? I take aught That teaches me their wrongs with greater pride Than this your ducal circlet. Thank you, sir! [The Duchess reads hastily; then, turning to the Courtiersâ What have I done to you? Your deed or mine Was it, this crowning me? I gave myself No more a title to your homage, no, Than church-flowers, born this season, wrote the words In the saint's-book that sanctified them first. For such a flower, you plucked me; well, you erredâ Well, 't was a weed; remove the eye-sore quick! But should you not remember it has lain Steeped in the candles' glory, palely shrined, Nearer God's Mother than most earthly things? âThat if't be faded 't is with prayer's sole breathâ That the one day it boasted was God's day? Still, I do thank you! Had you used respect, Here might I dwindle to my last white leaf, Here lose life's latest freshness, which even yet May yield some wandering insect rest and food: So, fling me forth, andâall is best for all! [After a pause.] Prince Berthold, who art Juliers' Duke it seemsâ The King's choice, and the Emperor's, and the Pope'sâ Be mine, too! Take this People! Tell not me Of rescripts, precedents, authorities, âBut take them, from a heart that yearns to give! Find out their love,âI could not; find their fear,â I would not; find their like,âI never shall, Among the flowers! [Taking off her coronet. Colombe of Ravestein Thanks God she is no longer Duchess here! Valence [advancing to Guibert]. Sir Guibert, knight, they call youâthis of mine Is the first step I ever set at court. You dared make me your instrument, I find; For that, so sure as you and I are men, We reckon to the utmost presently: But as you are a courtier and I none, Your knowledge may instruct me. I, already, Have too far outraged, by my ignorance Of courtier-ways, this lady, to proceed A second step and risk addressing her: âI am degradedâyou let me address! Out of her presence, all is plain enough What I shall doâbut in her presence, too, Surely there's something proper to be done. [To the others.] You, gentles, tell me if I guess arightâ May I not strike this man to earth? The Courtiers [as Guibert springs forward, with-holding him]. Let go! âThe clothiers' spokesman, Guibert? Grace a churl? The Duchess [to Valence]. Oh, be acquainted with your party, sir! He's of the oldest lineage Juliers boasts; A lion crests him for a cognizance âScorning to waverââthat's his 'scutcheon's word; His office with the new Dukeâprobably The same in honour as with me; or more, By so much as this gallant turn deserves. He's now, I dare say, of a thousand times The rank and influence that remain with her Whose part you take! So, lest for taking it You suffer . . . Valence. I may strike him then to earth? Guibert [falling on his knee]. Great and dear lady, pardon me! Hear once! Believe me and be mercifulâbe just! I could not bring myself to give that paper Without a keener pang than I dared meet âAnd so felt Clugnet here, and Maufroy here âNo one dared meet it. Protestation's cheap,â But, if to die for you did any good, [To Gaucelme.] Would not I die, sir? Say your worst of me! But it does no good, that's the mournful truth. And since the hint of a resistance, even, Would just precipitate, on you the first, A speedier ruinâI shall not deny, Saving myself indubitable pain, I thought to give you pleasure (who might say?) By showing that your only subject found To carry the sad notice, was the man Precisely ignorant of its contents; A nameless, mere provincial advocate; One whom't was like you never saw before, Never would see again. All has gone wrong; But I meant right, God knows, and you, I trust! The Duchess. A nameless advocate, this gentleman? â(I pardon you, Sir Guibert!) Guibert [rising, to Valence]. Sir, and you? Valence. âRejoice that you are lightened of a load. Now, you have only me to reckon with. The Duchess. One I have never seen, much less obliged? Valence. Dare I speak, lady? The Duchess. Dare you! Heard you not I rule no longer? Valence. Lady, if your rule Were based alone on such a ground as these [Pointing to the Courtiers. Could furnish you,âabjure it! They have hidden A source of true dominion from your sight. The Duchess. You hear themâno such source is left . . . Valence. Hear Cleves! Whose haggard craftsmen rose to starve this day, Starve now, and will lie down at night to starve, Sure of a like to-morrow-but as sure Of a most unlike morrow-after-that, Since end things must, end howsoe'er things may. What curbs the brute-force instinct in its hour? What makesâinstead of rising, all as one, And teaching fingers, so expert to wield Their tool, the broadsword's play or carbine's trick, âWhat makes that there's an easier help, they think, For you, whose name so few of them can spell, Whose face scarce one in every hundred saw,â You simply have to understand their wrongs, And wrongs will vanishâso, still trades are plied, And swords lie rusting, and myself stand here? There is a vision in the heart of each Of justice, mercy, wisdom, tenderness To wrong and pain, and knowledge of its cure: And these embodied in a woman's form That best transmits them, pure as first received, From God above her, to mankind below. Will you derive your rule from such a ground, Or rather hold it by the suffrage, say, Of this manâthisâand this? The Duchess [after a pause]. You come from Cleves: How many are at Cleves of such a mind? Valence [from his paper]. âWe, all the manufacturers of Clevesââ The Duchess. Or stay, sirâlest I seem too covetousâ Are you my subject? such as you describe, Am I to you, though to no other man? Valence [from his paper]. ââValence, ordained your Advocate at Clevesââ The Duchess [replacing the coronet]. Then I remain Cleves' Duchess! Take you note, While Cleves but yields one subject of this stamp, I stand her lady till she waves me off! For her sake, all the Prince claims I withhold; Laugh at each menace; and, his power defying, Return his missive with its due contempt! [Casting it away. Guibert [picking it up]. âWhich to the Prince I will deliver, lady, (Note it down, Gaucelme)âwith your message too! The Duchess. I think the office is a subject's, sir! âEither . . . . how style you him?âmy special guarder The Marshal'sâfor who knows but violence May follow the delivery?âOr, perhaps, My Chancellor'sâfor law may be to urge On its receipt!âOr, even my Chamberlain'sâ For I may violate established form! [To Valence.] Sir,âfor the half-hour till this service ends, Will you become all these to me? Valence [falling on his knee]. My liege! The Duchess. Give me! [The Courtiers present their badges of office. [Putting them by.] Whatever was their virtue once, They need new consecration. [Raising Valence.] Are you mine? I will be Duchess yet! [She retires. The Courtiers. Our Duchess yet! A glorious lady! Worthy love and dread! I'll stand by her,âAnd I, whate'er betide! Guibert [to Valence]. Well done, well done, sir! I care not who knows, You have done nobly and I envy youâ Tho' I am but unfairly used, I think: For when one gets a place like this I hold, One gets too the remark that its mere wages, The pay and the preferment, make our prize. Talk about zeal and faith apart from these, We're laughed atâmuch would zeal and faith subsist Without these also! Yet, let these be stopped, Our wages discontinue,âthen, indeed, Our zeal and faith, (we hear on every side,) Are not releasedâhaving been pledged away I wonder, for what zeal and faith in turn? Hard money purchased me my place! No, noâ I'm right, sirâbut your wrong is better still, If I had time and skill to argue it. Therefore, I say, I'll serve you, how you pleaseâ If you like,âfight you, as you seem to wishâ (The kinder of me that, in sober truth, I never dreamed I did you any harm) . . . Gaucelme. âOr, kinder still, you'll introduce, no doubt, His merits to the Prince who's just at hand, And let no hint drop he's made Chancellor And Chamberlain and Heaven knows what beside! Clugnet [to Valence]. You stare, young sir, and threaten! Let me say, That at your age, when first I came to court, I was not much above a gentleman; While now . . . Valence. âYou are Head-Lackey? With your office I have not yet been graced, sir! Other Courtiers [to Clugnet]. Let him talk! Fidelity, disinterestedness, Excuse so much! Men claim my worship ever Who staunchly and steadfastly . . . Enter Adolf. Adolf. The Prince arrives. Courtiers. Ha? How? Adolf. He leaves his guard a stage behind At Aix, and enters almost by himself. 1st Courtier. The Prince! This foolish business puts all out. 2nd Courtier. Let Gaucelme speak first! 3rd Courtier. Better I began About the state of Juliers: should one say All's prosperous and inviting him? 4th Courtier. âOr rather, All s prostrate and imploring him? 5th Courtier. That's best. Where's the Cleves' paper, by the way? 4th Courtier [to Valence]. Sirâsirâ If you'll but lend that paperâtrust it me, I'll warrant . . . 5th Courtier. Softly, sirâthe Marshal's duty! Clugnet. Has not the Chamberlain a hearing first By virtue of his patent? Gaucelme. Patents?âDuties? All that, my masters, must begin again! One word composes the whole controversy: We're simply nowâthe Prince's! The Others. Ayâthe Prince's! Enter Sabyne. Sabyne. Adolf! Bid . . . Oh, no time for ceremony! Where's whom our lady calls her only subject? She needs him. Who is here the Duchess's? Valence [starting from his reverie] Most gratefully I follow to her feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. AFTERNOON. Scene.âThe Vestibule. Enter Prince Berthold and Melchior. Berthold. A thriving little burgh this Juliers looks. [Half-apart.] Keep Juliers, and as good you kept Cologne: Better try Aix, though!â Melchior. Please't your Highness speak? Berthold [as before]. Aix, Cologne, Frankfort,âMilan;âRome!â Melchior. The Grave. More weary seems your Highness, I remark, Than sundry conquerors whose path I've watched Through fire and blood to any prize they gain. I could well wish you, for your proper sake, Had met some shade of opposition here âFound a blunt seneschal refuse unlock, Or a scared usher lead your steps astray. You must not look for next achievement's palm So easily: this will hurt your conquering. Berthold. My next? Ay, as you say, my next and next! Well, I am tired, that's truth, and moody too, This quiet entrance-morning: listen why! Our little burgh, now, Juliersâ't is indeed One link, however insignificant, Of the great chain by which I reach my hope, âA link I must secure; but otherwise, You'd wonder I esteem it worth my grasp. Just see what life is, with its shifts and turns! It happens nowâthis very nookâto be A place that once . . not a long while since, neitherâ When I lived an ambiguous hanger-on Of foreign courts, and bore my claims about, Discarded by one kinsman, and the other A poor priest merely,âthen, I say, this place Shone my ambition's object; to be Dukeâ Seemed then, what to be Emperor seems now. My rights were far from judged as plain and sure In those days as of late, I promise you: And't was my day-dream, Lady Colombe here Might e'en compound the matter, pity me, Be struck, say, with my chivalry and grace (I was a boy!)âbestow her hand at length, And make me Duke, in her right if not mine. Here am I, Duke confessed, at Juliers now. Hearken: if ever I be Emperor, Remind me what I felt and said to-day! Melchior. All this consoles a bookish man like me. âAnd so will weariness cling to you. Wrong, Wrong! Had you sought the lady's court yourself,â Faced the redoubtables composing it, Flattered this, threatened that man, bribed the other,â Pleaded by writ and word and deed, your cause,â Conquered a footing inch by painful inch,â And, after long years' struggle, pounced at last On her for prize,âthe right life had been lived, And justice done to divers faculties Shut in that brow. Yourself were visible As you stood victor, then; whom nowâ(your pardon!) I am forced narrowly to search and see, So are you hid by helpsâthis Pope, your uncleâ Your cousin, the other King! You are a mind,â They, body: too much of mere legs-and-arms Obstructs the mind so! Match these with their like: Match mind with mind! Berthold. And where's your mind to match? They show me legs-and-arms to cope withal! I'd subjugate this cityâwhere's its mind? [The Courtiers enter slowly. Melchior. Got out of sight when you came troops and all! And in its stead, here greets you flesh-and-blood: A smug Åconomy of both, this first! [As Clugnet bows obsequiously. Well done, gout, all considered!âI may go? Berthold. Help me receive them! Melchior. Oh, they just will say What yesterday at Aix their fellows said At Treves, the day before! Sir Prince, my friend. Why do you let your life slip thus?âMeantime, I have my little Juliers to achieveâ The understanding this tough Platonist, Your holy uncle disinterred, Amelius: Lend me a company of horse and foot, To help me through his tractateâgain my Duchy! Berthold. And Empire, after that is gained, will beâ? Melchior. To help me through your uncle's comment, Prince! [Goes. Berthold. Ah? Well: he o'er-refinesâthe scholar's fault! How do I let my life slip? Say, this life, I lead now, differs from the common life Of other men in mere degree, not kind, Of joys and griefs,âstill there is such degree Mere largeness in a life is something, sure,â Enough to care about and struggle for, In this world: for this world, the size of things; The sort of things, for that to come, no doubt. A great is better than a little aim: And when I wooed Priscilla's rosy mouth And failed so, under that grey convent-wall, Was I more happy than I should be now [By this time, the Courtiers are ranged before him. If failing of my Empire? Not a whit. âHere comes the mind, it once had tasked me sore To baffle, but for my advantages! All's best as 't is: these scholars talk and talk. [Seats himself. The Courtiers. Welcome our Prince to Juliers!âto his heritage! Our dutifullest service proffer we! Clugnet. I, please your Highness, having exercised The function of Grand Chamberlain at court, With much acceptance, as men testify . . . Berthold. I cannot greatly thank you, gentlemen! The Pope declares my claim to the Duchy founded On strictest justiceâyou concede it, therefore, I do not wonder: and the kings my friends Protest they mean to see such claim enforced,â You easily may offer to assist. But there's a slight discretionary power To serve me in the matter, you've had long, Though late you use it. This is well to sayâ But could you not have said it months ago? I'm not denied my own Duke's truncheon, trueâ 'T is flung meâI stoop down, and from the ground Pick it, with all you placid standers-by: And now I have it, gems and mire at once, Grace go with it to my soiled hands, you say! Guibert. (By Paul, the advocate our doughty friend Cuts the best figure!) Gaucelme. If our ignorance May have offended, sure our loyalty . . . Berthold. Loyalty? Yours? Ohâof yourselves you speak! I mean the Duchess all this time, I hope! And since I have been forced repeat my claims As if they never had been urged before, As I began, so must I end, it seems. The formal answer to the grave demand! What says the lady? Courtiers [one to another]. 1st Courtier. Marshal! 2nd Courtier. Orator! Guibert. A variation of our mistress' way! Wipe off his boots' dust, Clugnet!âthat, he waits! 1st Courtier. Your place! 2nd Courtier. Just now it was your own! Guibert. The devil's! Berthold [to Guibert]. Come forward, friendâyou with the paper, there! Is Juliers the first city I've obtained? By this time, I may boast proficiency In each decorum of the circumstance. Give it me as she gave itâthe petition, Demand, you style it! What's required, in brief? What title's reservation, appanage's Allowance? I heard all at Treves, last week. Gaucelme [to Guibert]. âGive it him as she gave it!â Guibert. And why not? [To Berthold.] The lady crushed your summons thus together, And bade me, with the very greatest scorn So fair a frame could hold, inform you . . . Courtiers. Stopâ Idiot! Guibert. âInform you she denied your claim, Defied yourself! (I tread upon his heel, The blustering advocate!) Berthold. By heaven and earth! Dare you jest, sir? Guibert. Did they at Treves, last week? Berthold [starting up]. Why then, I look much bolder than I knew, And you prove better actors than I thought: Since, as I live, I took you as you entered For just so many dearest friends of mine, Fled from the sinking to the rising power âThe sneaking'st crew, in short, I e'er despised! Whereas, I am alone here for the moment, With every soldier left behind at Aix! Silence? That means the worst? I thought as much! What follows next then? Courtiers. Gracious Prince, he raves! Guibert. He asked the truth and why not get the truth? Berthold. Am I a prisoner? Speak, will somebody? âBut why stand paltering with imbeciles? Let me see her, or . . . Guibert. Her, without her leave, Shall no one see: she's Duchess yet! Courtiers [footsteps without, as they are disputing]. Good chance! She's hereâthe Lady Colombe's self! Berthold. 'T is well! [Aside.] Array a handful thus against my world? Not ill done, truly! Were not this a mind To match one's mind with? Colombe! Let us wait! I failed so, under that grey convent wall! She comes. Guibert. The Duchess! Strangers, range yourselves! [As the Duchess enters in conversation with Valence, Berthold and the Courtiers fall back a little. The Duchess. Presagefully it beats, presagefully, My heart: the right is Berthold's and not mine. Valence. Grant that he has the right, dare I mistrust Your power to acquiesce so patiently As you believe, in such a dream-like change Of fortuneâchange abrupt, profound, complete? The Duchess. Ah, the first bitterness is over now! Bitter I may have felt it to confront The truth, and ascertain those natures' value I had so counted on; that was a pang: But I did bear it, and the worst is over. Let the Prince take them! Valence. And take Juliers too? âYour people without crosses, wands and chainsâ Only with hearts? The Duchess. There I feel guilty, sir! I cannot give up what I never had: For I ruled these, not themâthese stood between. Shall I confess, sir? I have heard by stealth Of Berthold from the first; more news and more: Closer and closer swam the thundercloud, But I was safely housed with these, I knew. At times when to the casement I would turn, At a bird's passage or a flower-trail's play, I caught the storm's red glimpses on its edgeâ Yet I was sure some one of all these friends Would interpose: I followed the bird's flight Or plucked the flower: some one would interpose! Valence. Not one thought on the Peopleâand Cleves there! The Duchess. Now, sadly conscious my real sway was missed, Its shadow goes without so much regret: Else could I not again thus calmly bid you, Answer Prince Berthold! Valence. Then you acquiesce? The Duchess. Remember over whom it was I ruled! Guibert [stepping forward]. Prince Berthold, yonder, craves an audience, lady! The Duchess [to Valence]. I only have to turn, and I shall face Prince Berthold! Oh, my very heart is sick! It is the daughter of a line of Dukes This scornful insolent adventurer Will bid depart from my dead father's halls! I shall not answer himâdispute with himâ But, as he bids, depart! Prevent it, sir! Sirâbut a mere day's respite! Urge for me âWhat I shall call to mind I should have urged When time's gone by: 't will all be mine, you urge! A dayâan hourâthat I myself may lay My rule down! 'T is too suddenâmust not be! The world's to hear of it! Once doneâfor ever! How will it read, sir? How be sung about? Prevent it! Berthold [approaching]. Your frank indignation, lady, Cannot escape me. Overbold I seem; But somewhat should be pardoned my surprise At this reception,âthis defiance, rather. And if, for their and your sake, I rejoice Your virtues could inspire a trusty few To make such gallant stand in your behalf, I cannot but be sorry, for my own, Your friends should force me to retrace my steps: Since I no longer am permitted speak After the pleasant peaceful course prescribed No less by courtesy than relationshipâ Which I remember, if you once forgot. But never must attack pass unrepelled. Suffer that, through you, I demand of these, Who controverts my claim to Juliers? The Duchess. âMe You say, you do not speak toâ Berthold. Of your subjects I ask, then: whom do you accredit? Where Stand those should answer? Valence [advancing]. The lady is alone. Berthold. Alone, and thus? So weak and yet so bold? Valence. I said she was aloneâ Berthold. And weak, I said. Valence. When is man strong until he feels alone? It was some lonely strength at first, be sure, Created organs, such as those you seek, By which to give its varied purpose shape: And, naming the selected ministrants, Took sword, and shield, and sceptre,âeach, a man! That strength performed its work and passed its way: You see our lady: there, the old shapes stand! âA Marshal, Chamberlain, and Chancellorâ âBe helped their way, into their death put life âAnd find advantage!ââso you counsel us. But let strength feel alone, seek help itself,â And, as the inland-hatched sea-creature hunts The sea's breast out,âas, littered 'mid the waves The desert-brute makes for the desert's joy, So turns our lady to her true resource, Passing o'er hollow fictions, worn-out types, âAnd I am first her instinct fastens on. And prompt I say, as clear as heart can speak, The People will not have you; nor shall have! It is not merely I shall go bring Cleves And fight you to the last,âthough that does much, And men and children,âay, and women too, Fighting for home, are rather to be feared Than mercenaries fighting for their payâ But, say you beat us, since such things have been, And, where this Juliers laughed, you set your foot Upon a steaming bloody plashâwhat then? Stand you the more our lord that there you stand? Lord it o'er troops whose force you concentrate, A pillared flame whereto all ardours tendâ Lord it 'mid priests whose schemes you amplify, A cloud of smoke 'neath which all shadows broodâ But never, in this gentle spot of earth, Can you become our Colombe, our play-queen, For whom, to furnish lilies for her hair, We'd pour our veins forth to enrich the soil. âOur conqueror? Yes!âOur despot? Yes!âOur Duke? Know yourself, know us! Berthold [who has been in thought]. Know your lady, also! [Very deferentially.]âTo whom I needs must exculpate myself For having made a rash demand, at least. Wherefore to you, sir, who appear to be Her chief adviser, I submit my claims, [Giving papers. But, this step taken, take no further step, Until the Duchess shall pronounce their worth. Here be our meeting-place; at night, its time: Till when I humbly take the lady's leave! [He withdraws. As the Duchess turns to Valence, the Courtiers interchange glances and come forward a little. 1st Courtier. So, this was their device! 2nd Courtier. No bad device! 3rd Courtier. You'd say they love each other, Guibert's friend From Cleves, and she, the Duchess! 4th Courtier. âAnd moreover, That all Prince Berthold comes for, is to help Their loves! 5th Courtier. Pray, Guibert, what is next to do? Guibert [advancing]. I laid my office at the Duchess' footâ Others. And Iâand Iâand I! The Duchess. I took them, sirs. Guibert [apart to Valence]. And now, sir, I am simple knight againâ Guibert, of the great ancient house, as yet That never bore affront; whate'er your birth,â As things stand now, I recognize yourself (If you'll accept experience of some date) As like to be the leading man o' the time, Therefore as much above me now, as I Seemed above you this morning. Then, I offered To fight you: will you be as generous And now fight me? Valence. Ask when my life is mine! Guibert. ('Tis hers now!) Clugnet [apart to Valence, as Guibert turns from him]. You, sir, have insulted me Grossly,âwill grant me, too, the selfsame favour You've granted him, just now, I make no question? Valence. I promise you, as him, sir. Clugnet. Do you so? Handsomely said! I hold you to it, sir. You'll get me reinstated in my office As you will Guibert! The Duchess. I would be alone! [They begin to retire slowly; as Valence is about to followâ Alone, sirâonly with my heart: you stay! Gaucelme. You hear that? Ah, light breaks upon me! Clevesâ It was at Cleves some man harangued us allâ With great effect,âso those who listened said, My thoughts being busy elsewhere: was this he? Guibert,âyour strange, disinterested man! Your uncorrupted, if uncourtly friend! The modest worth you mean to patronize! He cares about no Duchesses, not heâ His sole concern is with the wrongs of Cleves! What, Guibert? What, it breaks on you at last? Guibert. Would this hall's floor were a mine's roof! I'd back And in her very face . . . Gaucelme. Apply the match That fired the train,âand where would you be, pray? Guibert. With him! Gaucelme. Stand, rather, safe outside with me! The mine's charged: shall I furnish you the match And place you properly? To the antechamber! Guibert. Can you? Gaucelme. Try me! Your friend's in fortune! Guibert. Quickâ To the antechamber! He is pale with bliss! Gaucelme. No wonder! Mark her eyes! Guibert. To the antechamber! [The Courtiers retire. The Duchess. Sir, could you know all you have done for me You were content! You spoke, and I am saved. Valence. Be not too sanguine, lady! Ere you dream, That transient flush of generosity Fades off, perchance. The man, beside, is gone,â Him we might bend; but see, the papers hereâ Inalterably his requirement stays, And cold hard words have we to deal with now. In that large eye there seemed a latent pride, To self-denial not incompetent, But very like to hold itself dispensed From such a grace: however, let us hope! He is a noble spirit in noble form. I wish he less had bent that brow to smile As with the fancy how he could subject Himself upon occasion toâhimself! From rudeness, violence, you rest secure; But do not think your Duchy rescued yet! The Duchess. You,âwho have opened a new world to me, Will never take the faded language up Of that I leave? My Duchyâkeeping it, Or losing itâis that my sole world now? Valence. Ill have I spoken if you thence despise Juliers; although the lowest, on true grounds, Be worth more than the highest rule, on false: Aspire to rule, on the true grounds! The Duchess. Nay, hearâ False, I will neverârash, I would not be! This is indeed my birthdayâsoul and body, Its hours have done on me the work of years. You hold the requisition: ponder it! If I have right, my duty's plain: if heâ Say so, nor ever change a tone of voice! At night you meet the Prince; meet me at eve! Till when, farewell! This discomposes you? Believe in your own nature, and its force Of renovating mine! I take my stand Only as under me the earth is firm: So, prove the first step stable, all will prove. That first, I choose: [Laying her hand on his.]âthe next to take, choose you! [She withdraws. Valence [after a pause]. What drew down this on me? âon me, dead once, She thus bids live,âsince all I hitherto Thought dead in me, youth's ardours and emprise, Burst into life before her, as she bids Who needs them. Whither will this reach, where end? Her hand's print burns on mine . . . Yet she's aboveâ So very far above me! All's too plain: I served her when the others sank away, And she rewards me as such souls rewardâ The changed voice, the suffusion of the cheek, The eye's acceptance, the expressive hand, âReward, that's little, in her generous thought, Though all to me . . . I cannot so disclaim Heaven's gift, nor call it other than it is! She loves me! [Looking at the Prince's papers.]âWhich love, these, perchance, forbid. Can I decide against myselfâpronounce She is the Duchess and no mate for me? âCleves, help me! Teach me,âevery haggard face,â To sorrow and endure! I will do right Whatever be the issue. Help me, Cleves!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. EVENING. Scene.âAn Antechamber. Enter the Courtiers. Maufroy. Now, then, that we may speakâhow spring this mine? Gaucelme. Is Guibert ready for its match? He cools! Not so friend Valence with the Duchess there! âStay, Valence! Are not you my better self?â And her cheek mantledâ Guibert. Well, she loves him, sir: And more,âsince you will have it I grow cool,â She's right: he's worth it. Gaucelme. For his deeds to-day? Say so! Guibert. What should I say beside? Gaucelme. Not thisâ For friendship's sake leave this for me to sayâ That we're the dupes of an egregious cheat! This plain unpractised suitor, who found way To the Duchess through the merest die's turn-up A year ago, had seen her and been seen, Loved and been loved. Guibert. Impossible! Gaucelme. âNor say, How sly and exquisite a trick, moreover, Was this whichâtaking not their stand on facts Boldly, for that had been endurable, But worming on their way by craft, they choose Resort to, rather,âand which you and we, Sheep-like, assist them in the playing-off! The Duchess thus parades him as preferred, Not on the honest ground of preference, Seeing first, liking more, and there an endâ But as we all had started equally, And at the close of a fair race he proved The only valiant, sage and loyal man. Herself, too, with the pretty fits and starts,â The careless, winning, candid ignorance Of what the Prince might challenge or foregoâ She had a hero in reserve! What risk Ran she? This deferential easy Prince Who brings his claims for her to ratify âHe's just her puppet for the nonce! You'll see,â Valence pronounces, as is equitable, Against him: off goes the confederate: As equitably, Valence takes her hand! The Chancellor. You run too fast: her hand, no subject takes. Do not our archives hold her father's will? That will provides against such accident, And gives next heir, Prince Berthold, the reversion Of Juliers, which she forfeits, wedding so. Gaucelme. I know that, well as you,âbut does the Prince? Knows Berthold, think you, that this plan, he helps, For Valence's ennoblement,âwould end, If crowned with the success which seems its due, In making him the very thing he plays, The actual Duke of Juliers? All agree That Colombe's title waived or set aside, He is next heir. The Chancellor. Incontrovertibly. Gaucelme. Guibert, your match, now, to the train! Guibert. Enough! I'm with you: selfishness is best again. I thought of turning honestâwhat a dream! Let's wake now! Gaucelme. Selfish, friend, you never were: 'T was but a series of revenges taken On your unselfishness for prospering ill. But now that you're grown wiser, what's our course? Guibert. âWait, I suppose, till Valence weds our lady, And then, if we must needs revenge ourselves, Apprise the Prince. Gaucelme. âThe Prince, ere then dismissed With thanks for playing his mock part so well? Tell the Prince now, sir! Ay, this very night, Ere he accepts his dole and goes his way, Explain how such a marriage makes him Duke, Then trust his gratitude for the surprise! Guibert. âOur lady wedding Valence all the same As if the penalty were undisclosed? Good! If she loves, she 'll not disown her love, Throw Valence up. I wonder you see that. Gaucelme. The shame of itâthe suddenness and shame! Within her, the inclining heartâwithout, A terrible array of witnessesâ And Valence by, to keep her to her word, With Berthold's indignation or disgust! We'll try it!âNot that we can venture much. Her confidence we've lost for ever: Berthold's Is all to gain. Guibert. To-night, then, venture we! Yetâif lost confidence might be renewed? Gaucelme. Never in noble natures! With the base ones,â Twist off the crab's claw, wait a smarting-while, And something grows and grows and gets to be A mimic of the lost joint, just so like As keeps in mind it never, never will Replace its predecessor! Crabs do that: But lop the lion's footâand . . . Guibert. To the Prince! Gaucelme [aside]. And come what will to the lion's foot, I pay you, My cat's-paw, as I long have yearned to pay. [Aloud.] Footsteps! Himself! 'Tis Valence breaks on us, Exulting that their scheme succeeds. We'll henceâ And perfect ours! Consult the archives, firstâ Then, fortified with knowledge, seek the Hall! Clugnet [to Gaucelme as they retire]. You have not smiled so since your father died! As they retire, enter Valence with papers. Valence. So must it be! I have examined these With scarce a palpitating heartâso calm, Keeping her image almost wholly off, Setting upon myself determined watch, Repelling to the uttermost his claims: And the result isâall men would pronounce And not I, only, the result to beâ Berthold is heir; she has no shade of right To the distinction which divided us, But, suffered to rule first, I know not why, Her rule connived at by those Kings and Popes, To serve some devil's-purpose,ânow 't is gained, Whate'er it was, the rule expires as well. âValence, this rapture . . . selfish can it be? Eject it from your heart, her home!âIt stays! Ah, the brave world that opens on us both! âDo my poor townsmen so esteem it? Cleves,â I need not your pale faces! This, reward For service done to you? Too horrible! I never served you: 't was myself I servedâ Nay, served notârather saved from punishment Which, had I failed you then, would plague me now. My life continues yours, and your life, mine. But if, to take God's gift, I swerve no stepâ Cleves! If I breathe no prayer for itâif she, [Footsteps without. Colombe, that comes now, freely gives herselfâ Will Cleves require, that, turning thus to her, I . . . Enter Prince Berthold. Pardon, sir! I did not look for you Till night, i' the Hall; nor have as yet declared My judgment to the lady. Berthold. So I hoped. Valence. And yet I scarcely know why that should check The frank disclosure of it first to youâ What her right seems, and what, in consequence, She will decide on. Berthold. That I need not ask. Valence. You need not: I have proved the lady's mind: And, justice being to do, dare act for her. Berthold. Doubtless she has a very noble mind. Valence. Oh, never fear but she'll in each conjuncture Bear herself bravely! She no whit depends On circumstance; as she adorns a throne, She had adorned . . . Berthold. A cottageâin what book Have I read that, of every queen that lived? A throne? You have not been instructed, sure, To forestall my request? Valence. 'Tis granted, sir! My heart instructs me. I have scrutinized Your claims . . . Berthold. Ahâclaims, you mean, at first preferred? I come, before the hour appointed me, To pray you let those claims at present rest, In favour of a new and stronger one. Valence. You shall not need a stronger: on the part O' the lady, all you offer I accept, Since one clear right suffices: yours is clear. Propose! Berthold. I offer her my hand. Valence. Your hand? Berthold. A Duke's, yourself say; and, at no far time, Something here whispers meâan Emperor's. The lady's mind is noble: which induced This seizure of occasion ere my claims Wereâsettled, let us amicably say! Valence. Your hand! Berthold. (He will fall down and kiss it next!) Sir, this astonishment's too flattering, Nor must you hold your mistress' worth so cheap. Enhance it, rather,âurge that blood is bloodâ The daughter of the Burgraves, Landgraves, Markgraves, Remains their daughter! I shall scarce gainsay. Elsewhere or here, the lady needs must rule: Like the imperial crown's great chrysoprase, They talk ofâsomewhat out of keeping there, And yet no jewel for a meaner cap. Valence. You wed the Duchess? Berthold. Cry you mercy, friend! Will the match also influence fortunes here? A natural solicitude enough. Be certain, no bad chance it proves for you! However high you take your present stand, There's prospect of a higher still removeâ For Juliers will not be my resting-place, And, when I have to choose a substitute To rule the little burgh, I'll think of you Who need not give your mates a character. And yet I doubt your fitness to supplant The grey smooth Chamberlain: he'd hesitate A doubt his lady could demean herself So low as to accept me. Courage, sir! I like your method better: feeling's play Is franker much, and flatters me beside. Valence. I am to say, you love her? Berthold. Say that too! Love has no great concernment, thinks the world, With a Duke's marriage. How go precedents In Juliers' storyâhow use Juliers' Dukes? I see you have them here in goodly row; Yon must be Luitpoldâay, a stalwart sire! Say, I have been arrested suddenly In my ambition's course, its rocky course, By this sweet flower: I fain would gather it And then proceed: so say and speedily â(Nor stand there like Duke Luitpold's brazen self!) Enough, sir: you possess my mind, I think. This is my claim, the others being withdrawn, And to this be it that, i' the Hall to-night, Your lady's answer comes; till when, farewell! [He retires. Valence [after a pause]. The heavens and earth stay as they were; my heart Beats as it beat: the truth remains the truth. What falls away, then, if not faith in her? Was it my faith, that she could estimate Love's value, and, such faith still guiding me, Dare I now test her? Or grew faith so strong Solely because no power of test was mine? Enter the Duchess. The Duchess. My fate, sir! Ah, you turn away. All's over. But you are sorry for me? Be not so! What I might have become, and never was, Regret with me! What I have merely been, Rejoice I am no longer! What I seem Beginning now, in my new state, to be, Hope that I am!âfor, once my rights proved void, This heavy roof seems easy to exchange For the blue sky outsideâmy lot henceforth. Valence. And what a lot is Berthold's! The Duchess. How of him? Valence. He gathers earth's whole good into his arms; Standing, as man now, stately, strong and wise, Marching to fortune, not surprised by her. One great aim, like a guiding-star, aboveâ Which tasks strength, wisdom, stateliness, to lift His manhood to the height that takes the prize; A prize not nearâlest overlooking earth He rashly spring to seize itânor remote, So that he rest upon his path content: But day by day, while shimmering grows shine, And the faint circlet prophesies the orb, He sees so much as, just evolving these, The stateliness, the wisdom and the strength, To due completion, will suffice this life, And lead him at his grandest to the grave. After this star, out of a night he springs; A beggar's cradle for the throne of thrones He quits; so, mounting, feels each step he mounts, Nor, as from each to each exultingly He passes, overleaps one grade of joy. This, for his own good:âwith the world, each gift Of God and man,âreality, tradition, Fancy and factâso well environ him, That as a mystic panoply they serveâ Of force, untenanted, to awe mankind, And work his purpose out with half the world, While he, their master, dexterously slipt From such encumbrance, is meantime employed With his own prowess on the other half. Thus shall he prosper, every day's success Adding, to what is he, a solid strengthâ An aÃ«ry might to what encircles him, Till at the last, so life's routine lends help, That as the Emperor only breathes and moves, His shadow shall be watched, his step or stalk Become a comfort or a portent, how He trails his ermine take significance,â Till even his power shall cease to be most power, And men shall dread his weakness more, nor dare Peril their earth its bravest, first and best, Its typified invincibility. Thus shall he go on, greatening, till he endsâ The man of men, the spirit of all flesh, The fiery centre of an earthly world! The Duchess. Some such a fortune I had dreamed should rise Out of my ownâthat is, above my power Seemed other, greater potencies to stretchâ Valence. For you? The Duchess. It was not I moved there, I think: But one I could,âthough constantly beside, And aye approaching,âstill keep distant from, And so adore. 'T was a man moved there. Valence. Who? The Duchess. I felt the spirit, never saw the face. Valence. See it! 'Tis Berthold's! He enables you To realize your vision. The Duchess. Berthold? Valence. Dukeâ Emperor to be: he proffers you his hand. The Duchess. Generous and princely! Valence. He is all of this. The Duchess. Thanks, Berthold, for my father's sake! No hand Degrades me. Valence. You accept the proffered hand? The Duchess. That he should love me! Valence. âLovedâ I did not say. Had that beenâlove might so incline the Prince To the world's good, the world that's at his foot,â I do not know, this moment, I should dare Desire that you refused the worldâand Clevesâ The sacrifice he asks. The Duchess. Not love me, sir? Valence. He scarce affirmed it. The Duchess. May not deeds affirm? Valence. What does he? . . . Yes, yes, very much he does! All the shame saved, he thinks, and sorrow savedâ Immitigable sorrow, so he thinks,â Sorrow that's deeper than we dream, perchance. The Duchess. Is not this love? Valence. So very much he does! For look, you can descend now gracefully: All doubts are banished, that the world might have, Or worst, the doubts yourself, in after-time, May call up of your heart's sincerencess now. To such, reply, âI could have kept my ruleâ âIncreased it to the utmost of my dreamsâ âYet I abjured it.â This, he does for you: It is munificently much. The Duchess. Still âmuch!â But why is it not love, sir? Answer me! Valence. Because not one of Berthold's words and looks Had gone with love's presentment of a flower To the beloved: because bold confidence, Open superiority, free prideâ Love owns not, yet were all that Berthold owned: Because where reason, even, finds no flaw, Unerringly a lover's instinct may. The Duchess. You reason, then, and doubt? Valence. I love, and know. The Duchess. You love? How strange! I never cast a thought On that. Just see our selfishness! You seemed So much my own . . . I had no groundâand yet, I never dreamed another might divide My power with you, much less exceed it. Valence Lady, I am yours wholly The Duchess. Oh, no, no, not mine! 'Tis not the same now, never more can be. âYour first love, doubtless. Well, what's gone from me? What have I lost in you? Valence. My heart repliesâ No loss there! So, to Berthold back again: This offer of his hand, he bids me makeâ Its obvious magnitude is well to weigh. The Duchess. She's . . . yes, she must be very fair for you! Valence. I am a simple advocate of Cleves. The Duchess. You! With the heart and brain that so helped me, I fancied them exclusively my own, Yet find are subject to a stronger sway She must be . . . tell me, is she very fair? Valence. Most fair, beyond conception or belief. The Duchess. Black eyes?âno matter! Colombe, the world leads Its life without you, whom your friends professed The only woman: see how true they spoke! One lived this while, who never saw your face, Nor heard your voiceâunless . . . Is she from Cleves? Valence. Cleves knows her well. The Duchess. Ahâjust a fancy, now! When you poured forth the wrongs of Cleves,âI said, âThought, that is, afterward . . . Valence. You thought of me? The Duchess. Of whom else? Only such great cause, I thought, For such effect: see what true love can do! Cleves is his love. I almost fear to ask . . . And will not. This is idling: to our work! Admit before the Prince, without reserve, My claims misgrounded; then may follow better . . . When you poured out Cleves' wrongs impetuously, Was she in your mind? Valence. All done was done for her âTo humble me! The Duchess. She will be proud at least. Valence. She? The Duchess. When you tell her. Valence. That will never be. The Duchess. Howâare there sweeter things you hope to tell? No, sir! You counselled me,âI counsel you In the one point Iâany womanâcan. Your worth, the first thing; let her own come nextâ Say what you did through her, and she through youâ The praises of her beauty afterward! Will you? Valence. I dare not. The Duchess. Dare not? Valence. She I love Suspects not such a love in me. The Duchess. You jest. Valence. The lady is above me and away. Not only the brave form, and the bright mind, And the great heart, combine to press me lowâ But all the world calls rank divides us. The Duchess. Rank! Now grant me patience! Here's a man declares Oracularly in another's caseâ Sees the true value and the false, for themâ Nay, bids them see it, and they straight do see. You called my court's love worthlessâso it turned: I threw away as dross my heap of wealth, And here you stickle for a piece or two! Firstâhas she seen you? Valence. Yes. The Duchess. She loves you, then. Valence. One flash of hope burst; then succeeded night: And all's at darkest now. Impossible! The Duchess. We'll try: you areâso to speakâmy subject yet? Valence. As everâto the death. The Duchess. Obey me, then! Valence. I must. The Duchess. Approach her, and . . . no! first of all Get more assurance. âMy instructress,â say, âWas great, descended from a line of kings, âAnd even fairââ(wait why I say this folly)â âShe said, of all men, none for eloquence, âCourage, and (what cast even these to shade) âThe heart they sprung from,ânone deserved like him âWho saved her at her need: if she said this, âWhat should not one I love, say?â Valence. Heavenâthis hopeâ Oh, lady, you are filling me with fire! The Duchess. Say this!ânor think I bid you cast aside One touch of all the awe and reverence; Nay, make her proud for once to heart's content That all this wealth of heart and soul's her own! Think you are all of this,âand, thinking it, . . . (Obey!) Valence. I cannot choose. The Duchess. Then, kneel to her! [Valence sinks on his knee. I dream! Valence. Have mercy! Yours, unto the death,â I have obeyed. Despise, and let me die! The Duchess. Alas, sir, is it to be ever thus? Even with you as with the world? I know This morning's service was no vulgar deed Whose motive, once it dares avow itself, Explains all done and infinitely more, So, takes the shelter of a nobler cause. Your service named its true source,âloyalty! The rest's unsaid again. The Duchess bids you, Rise, sir! The Prince's words were in debate. Valence [rising]. Rise? Truth, as ever, lady, comes from you! I should riseâI who spoke for Cleves, can speak For Manâyet tremble now, who stood firm then. I laughedâfor 't was past tearsâthat Cleves should starve With all hearts beating loud the infamy, And no tongue daring trust as much to air: Yet here, where all hearts speak, shall I be mute? Oh, lady, for your own sake look on me! On all I am, and have, and doâheart, brain, Body and soul,âthis Valence and his gifts! I was proud once: I saw you, and they sank, So that each, magnified a thousand times, Were nothing to youâbut such nothingness, Would a crown gild it, or a sceptre prop, A treasure speed, a laurel-wreath enhance? What is my own desert? But should your love Have . . . there's no language helps here . . . singled me,â Thenâoh, that wild word âthen!ââbe just to love, In generosity its attribute! Love, since you pleased to love! All's clearedâa stage For trial of the question kept so long: Judge youâIs love or vanity the best? You, solve it for the world's sakeâyou, speak first What all will shout one dayâyou, vindicate Our earth and be its angel! All is said. Lady, I offer nothingâI am yours: But, for the cause' sake, look on me and him, And speak! The Duchess. I have received the Prince's message: Say, I prepare my answer! Valence. Take me, Cleves! [He withdraws. The Duchess. Mournfulâthat nothing's what it calls itself! Devotion, zeal, faith, loyaltyâmere love! And, love in question, what may Berthold's be? I did ill to mistrust the world so soon: Already was this Berthold at my side. The valley-level has its hawks no doubt: May not the rock-top have its eagles, too? Yet Valence . . . let me see his rival then!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. NIGHT. Scene.âThe Hall. Enter Berthold and Melchior. Melchior. And here you wait the matter's issue? Berthold. Here. Melchior. I don't regret I shut Amelius, then. But tell me, on this grand disclosure,âhow Behaved our spokesman with the forehead? Berthold. Oh, Turned out no better than the foreheadlessâ Was dazzled not so very soon, that's all! For my part, this is scarce the hasty showy Chivalrous measure you give me credit of. Perhaps I had a fancy,âbut 'tis gone. âLet her commence the unfriended innocent And carry wrongs about from court to court? No, truly! The least shake of fortune's sand, âMy uncle-Pope chokes in a coughing fit, King-cousin takes a fancy to blue eyes,â And wondrously her claims would brighten up; Forth comes a new gloss on the ancient law, O'er-looked provisoes, o'er-past premises, Follow in plenty. No: 'tis the safe step. The hour beneath the convent-wall is lost: Juliers and she, once mine, are ever mine. Melchior. Which is to say, you, losing heart already, Elude the adventure. Berthold. Not soâor, if soâ Why not confess at once that I advise None of our kingly craft and guild just now To lay, one moment, down their privilege With the notion they can any time at pleasure Retake it: that may turn out hazardous. We seem, in Europe, pretty well at end O' the night, with our great masque: those favoured few Who keep the chamber's top, and honour's chance Of the early evening, may retain their place And figure as they list till out of breath. But it is growing late: and I observe A dim grim kind of tipstaves at the doorway Not only bar new-comers entering now, But caution those who left, for any cause, And would return, that morning draws too near; The ball must die off, shut itself up. Weâ I think, may dance lights out and sunshine in, And sleep off headache on our frippery: But friend the other, who cunningly stole out, And, after breathing the fresh air outside, Means to re-enter with a new costume, Will be advised go back to bed, I fear. I stick to privilege, on second thoughts. Melchior. Yesâyou evade the adventure: and, beside, Give yourself out for colder than you are. King Philip, only, notes the lady's eyes? Don't they come in for somewhat of the motive With you too? Berthold. Yesâno: I am past that now. Gone 'tis: I cannot shut my soul to fact. Of course, I might by forethought and contrivance Reason myself into a rapture. Gone: And something better come instead, no doubt. Melchior. So be it! Yet, all the same, proceed my way, Though to your ends; so shall you prosper best! The lady,âto be won for selfish ends,â Will be won easier my unselfish . . . call it, Romantic way. Berthold. Won easier? Melchior. Will not she? Berthold. There I profess humility without bound: Ill cannot speedânot Iâthe Emperor. Melchior. And I should think the Emperor best waived, From your description of her mood and way. You could look, if it pleased you, into hearts; But are too indolent and fond of watching Your ownâyou know that, for you study it. Berthold. Had you but seen the orator her friend, So bold and voluble an hour before, Abashed to earth at aspect of the change! Make her an Empress? Ah, that changed the case! Oh, I read hearts! 'T is for my own behoof, I court her with my true worth: wait the event! I learned my final lesson on that head When years ago,âmy first and last essayâ Before the priest my uncle could by help Of his superior, raise me from the dirtâ Priscilla left me for a Brabant lord Whose cheek was like the topaz on his thumb. I am past illusion on that score. Melchior. Here comes The ladyâ Berthold. âAnd there you go. But do not! Give me Another chance to please you! Hear me plead! Melchior. You'll keep, then, to the lover, to the man? Enter the Duchessâfollowed by Adolf and Sabyne and, after an interval, by the Courtiers. Berthold. Good auspice to our meeting! The Duchess. May it prove! âAnd you, sir, will be Emperor one day? Berthold. (Ay, that's the point!) I may be Emperor. The Duchess. 'Tis not for my sake only, I am proud Of this you offer: I am prouder far That from the highest state should duly spring The highest, since most generous, of deeds. Berthold. (Generousâstill that!) You underrate yourself. You are, what I, to be complete, must gainâ Find now, and may not find, another time. While I career on all the world for stage, There needs at home my representative. The Duchess. âSuch, rather, would some warrior-woman beâ One dowered with lands and gold, or rich in friendsâ One like yourself. Berthold. Lady, I am myself, And have all these: I want what's not myself, Nor has all these. Why give one hand two swords? Here's one already: be a friend's next gift A silk glove, if you willâI have a sword. The Duchess. You love me, then? Berthold. Your lineage I revere, Honour your virtue, in your truth believe, Do homage to your intellect, and bow Before your peerless beauty. The Duchess. But, for loveâ Berthold. A further love I do not understand. Our best course is to say these hideous truths, And see them, once said, grow endurable: Like waters shuddering from their central bed, Black with the midnight bowels of the earth, That, once up-spouted by an earthquake's throe, A portent and a terrorâsoon subside, Freshen apace, take gold and rainbow hues In sunshine, sleep in shadow, and at last Grow common to the earth as hills or treesâ Accepted by all things they came to scare. The Duchess. You cannot love, then? Berthold. âCharlemagne, perhaps! Are you not over-curious in love-lore? The Duchess. I have become so, very recently. It seems, then, I shall best deserve esteem, Respect, and all your candour promises, By putting on a calculating moodâ Asking the terms of my becoming yours? Berthold. Let me not do myself injustice, neither. Because I will not condescend to fictions That promise what my soul can ne'er acquit, It does not follow that my guarded phrase May not include far more of what you seek, Than wide profession of less scrupulous men. You will be Empress, once for all: with me The Pope disputes supremacyâyou stand, And none gainsays, the earth's first woman. The Duchess. Thatâ Or simple Lady of Ravestein again? Berthold. The matter's not in my arbitrament: Now I have made my claimsâwhich I regretâ Cede one, cede all. The Duchess. This claim then, you enforce? Berthold. The world looks on. The Duchess. And when must I decide? Berthold. When, lady? Have I said thus much so promptly For nothing?âPoured out, with such pains, at once What I might else have suffered to ooze forth Droplet by droplet in a lifetime longâ For aught less than as prompt an answer, too? All's fairly told now: who can teach you more? The Duchess. I do not see him. Berthold. I shall ne'er deceive This offer should be made befittingly Did time allow the better setting forth The good of it, with what is not so good, Advantage, and disparagement as well: But as it is, the sum of both must serve. I am already weary of this place; My thoughts are next stage on to Rome. Decide! The Empireâor,ânot even Juliers now! Hail to the Empressâfarewell to the Duchess! [The Courtiers, who have been drawing nearer and nearer, interpose. Gaucelme. ââFarewell,â Prince? when we break in at our riskâ Clugnet. Almost upon court-licence trespassingâ Gaucelme. âTo point out how your claims are valid yet! You know not, by the Duke her father's will, The lady, if she weds beneath her rank, Forfeits her Duchy in the next heir's favourâ So 'tis expressly stipulate. And if It can be shown 'tis her intent to wed A subject, then yourself, next heir, by right Succeed to Juliers. Berthold. What insanity?â Guibert. Sir, there's one Valence, the pale fiery man You saw and heard this morningâthought, no doubt, Was of considerable standing here: I put it to your penetration, Prince, If aught save love, the truest love for her Could make him serve the lady as he did! He's simply a poor advocate of Cleves âCreeps here with difficulty, finds a place With danger, gets in by a miracle, And for the first time meets the lady's faceâ So runs the story: is that credible? For, firstâno sooner in, than he's apprised Fortunes have changed; you are all-powerful here, The lady as powerless: he stands fast by her! The Duchess [aside]. And do such deeds spring up from love alone? Guibert. But here occurs the question, does the lady Love him again? I say, how else can she? Can she forget how he stood singly forth In her defence, dared outrage all of us, Insult yourselfâfor what, save love's reward? The Duchess [aside]. And is love then the sole reward of love? Guibert. But, love him as she may and mustâyou ask, Means she to wed him? âYes,â both natures answer! Both, in their pride, point out the sole result; Nought less would he accept nor she propose. For each conjecture was she great enough âWill be, for this. Clugnet. Though, now that this is known, Policy, doubtless, urges she deny . . . The Duchess. âWhat, sir, and wherefore?âsince I am not sure That all is any other than you say! You take this Valence, hold him close to me, Him with his actions: can I choose but look? I am not sure, love trulier shows itself Than in this man, you hate and would degrade, Yet, with your worst abatement, show me thus. Nor am Iâ(thus made look within myself, Ere I had dared)ânow that the look is daredâ Sure that I do not love him! Guibert. Hear you, Prince? Berthold. And what, sirs, please you, may this prattle mean Unless to prove with what alacrity You give your lady's secrets to the world? How much indebted, for discovering That quality, you make me, will be found When there's a keeper for my own to seek. Courtiers. âOur lady?â Berthold. âShe assuredly remains. The Duchess. Ah, Princeâand you too can be generous? You could renounce your power, if this were so, And let me, as these phrase it, wed my love Yet keep my Duchy? You perhaps exceed Him, even, in disinterestedness! Berthold. How, lady, should all this affect my purpose? Your will and choice are still as ever, free. Say, you have known a worthier than myself In mind and heart, of happier form and faceâ Others must have their birthright: I have gifts. To balance theirs, not blot them out of sight. Against a hundred alien qualities, I lay the prize I offer. I am nothing: Wed you the Empire? The Duchess. And my heart away? Berthold. When have I made pretension to your heart? I give none. I shall keep your honour safe; With mine I trust you, as the sculptor trusts Yon marble woman with the marble rose, Loose on her hand, she never will let fall, In graceful, slight, silent security. You will be proud of my world-wide career, And I content in you the fair and good. What were the use of planting a few seeds The thankless climate never would matureâ Affections all repelled by circumstance? Enough: to these no credit I attach,â To what you own, find nothing to object. Write simply on my requisition's face What shall content my friendsâthat you admit, As Colombe of Ravestein, the claims therein, Or never need admit them, as my wifeâ And either way, all's ended! The Duchess. Let all end! Berthold. The requisition! Guibert. âValence holds, of course! Berthold. Desire his presence! [Adolf goes out. Courtiers [to each other]. Out it all comes yet; He'll have his word against the bargain yet; He's not the man to tamely acquiesce. One passionate appealâupbraiding even, May turn the tide again. Despair not yet! [They retire a little. Berthold [to Melchior]. The Empire has its old success, my friend! Melchior. You've had your way: before the spokesman speaks, Let me, but this once, work a problem out, And ever more be dumb! The Empire wins? To better purpose have I read my books! Enter Valence. Melchior [to the Courtiers]. Apart, my masters! [To Valence.] Sir, one word with you! I am a poor dependant of the Prince'sâ Pitched on to speak, as of slight consequence. You are no higher, I find: in other words, We two, as probably the wisest here, Need not hold diplomatic talk like fools. Suppose I speak, divesting the plain fact Of all their tortuous phrases, fit for them? Do you reply so, and what trouble saved! The Prince, thenâan embroiled strange heap of news This moment reaches himâif true or false, All dignity forbids he should inquire In person, or by worthier deputy; Yet somehow must inquire, lest slander come: And so, 't is I am pitched on. You have heard His offer to your lady? Valence. Yes. Melchior. âConceive Her joy thereat? Valence. I cannot. Melchior. No one can. All draws to a conclusion, therefore. Valence [aside]. So! No after-judgmentâno first thought revisedâ Her first and last decision!âme, she leaves, Takes him; a simple heart is flung aside, The ermine o'er a heartless breast embraced. Oh Heaven, this mockery has been played too oft! Once, to surprise the angelsâtwice, that fiends Recording, might be proud they chose not soâ Thrice, many thousand times, to teach the world All men should pause, misdoubt their strength, since men Can have such chance yet fail so signally, âBut ever, ever this farewell to Heaven, Welcome to earthâthis taking death for lifeâ This spurning love and kneeling to the worldâ Oh Heaven, it is too often and too old! Melchior. Well, on this point, what but an absurd rumour Arisesâthese, its sourceâits subject, you! Your faith and loyalty misconstruing, They say, your service claims the lady's hand! Of course, nor Prince nor lady can respond: Yet something must be said: for, were it true You made such claim, the Prince would . . . Valence. Well, sir,âwould? Melchior. âNot only probably withdraw his suit, But, very like, the lady might be forced Accept your own. Oh, there are reasons why! But you'll excuse at present all save one,â I think so. What we want is, your own witness, For, or againstâher good, or yours: decide! Valence [aside]. Be it her good if she accounts it so! [After a contest.] For what am I but hers, to choose as she? Who knows how far, beside, the light from her May reach, and dwell with, what she looks upon? Melchior [to the Prince]. Now to him, you! Berthold [to Valence]. My friend acquaints you, sir, The noise runs . . . Valence. âPrince, how fortunate are you, Wedding her as you will, in spite of noise, To show belief in love! Let her but love you, All else you disregard! What else can be? You know how love is incompatible With falsehoodâpurifies, assimilates All other passions to itself. Melchior. Ay, sir: But softly! Where, in the object we select, Such love is, perchance, wanting? Valence. Then indeed, What is it you can take? Melchior. Nay, ask the world! Youth, beauty, virtue, an illustrious name, An influence o'er mankind. Valence. When man perceives . . . âAh, I can only speak as for myself! The Duchess. Speak for yourself! Valence. May I?âno, I have spoken, And time's gone by. Had I seen such an one, As I loved herâweighing thoroughly that wordâ So should my task be to evolve her love: If for myself!âif for anotherâwell. Berthold. Heroic truly! And your sole reward,â The secret pride in yielding up love's right? Valence. Who thought upon reward? And yet how much Comes afterâoh, what amplest recompense! Is the knowledge of her, nought? the memory, nought? âLady, should such an one have looked on you, Ne'er wrong yourself so far as quote the world And say, love can go unrequited here! You will have blessed him to his whole life's endâ Low passions hindered, baser cares kept back, All goodness cherished where you dweltâand dwell. What would he have? He holds youâyou, both form And mind, in his,âwhere self-love makes such room For love of you, he would not serve you now The vulgar way,ârepulse your enemies, Win you new realms, or best, to save the old Die blissfullyâthat's past so long ago! He wishes you no need, thought, care of himâ Your good, by any means, himself unseen, Away, forgotten!âHe gives that life's task up, As it were . . . but this charge which I returnâ [Offers the requisition, which she takes. Wishing your good. The Duchess [having subscribed it]. And opportunely, sirâ Since at a birthday's close, like this of mine, Good wishes gentle deeds reciprocate. Most on a wedding-day, as mine is too, Should gifts be thought of: yours comes first by right. Ask of me! Berthold. He shall have whate'er he asks, For your sake and his own. Valence [aside]. If I should askâ The withered bunch of flowers she wearsâperhaps, One last touch of her hand, I never more Shall see! [After a pause, presenting his paper to the Prince. Cleves' Prince, redress the wrongs of Cleves! Berthold. I will, sir! The Duchess [as Valence prepares to retire]. âNay, do out your duty, first! You bore this paper; I have registered My answer to it: read it and have done! [Valence reads it I take himâgive up Juliers and the world. This is my Birthday. Melchior. Berthold, my one hero Of the world she gives up, one friend worth my books, Sole man I think it pays the pains to watch,â Speak, for I know you through your Popes and Kings! Berthold [after a pause]. Lady, well rewarded! Sir, as well deserved! I could not imitateâI hardly envyâ I do admire you. All is for the best. Too costly a flower were this, I see it now, To pluck and set upon my barren helm To witherâany garish plume will do. I'll not insult you and refuse your Duchyâ You can so well afford to yield it me, And I were left, without it, sadly lorn. As it isâfor meâif that will flatter you, A somewhat wearier life seems to remain Than I thought possible where . . . 'faith, their life Begins already! They're too occupied To listen: and few words content me best. [Abruptly to the Courtiers.] I am your Duke, though! Who obey me here? The Duchess. Adolf and Sabyne follow usâ Guibert [starting from the Courtiers]. âAnd I? Do I not follow them, if I may n't you? Shall not I get some little duties up At Ravestein and emulate the rest? God save you, Gaucelme! 'T is my Birthday, too! Berthold. You happy handful that remain with me . . That is, with Dietrich the black Barnabite I shall leave over youâwill earn your wages Or Dietrich has forgot to ply his trade! Meantime,âgo copy me the precedents Of every installation, proper styles And pedigrees of all your Juliers' Dukesâ While I prepare to plod on my old way, And somewhat wearily, I must confess! The Duchess [with a light joyous laugh as she turns from them]. Come, Valence, to our friends, God's earth . . . Valence [as she falls into his arms]. âAnd thee!</field>
