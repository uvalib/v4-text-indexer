      <field name="fulltext">THE HISTORICAL PERIODâWHEN THE DUKE OF BOURBON HAVING RENOUNCED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO FRANCIS I. OF FRANCE, AT THE HEAD OF A SPANISH ARMY INVADED HIS NATIVE COUNTRY, AND LAID SIEGE TO MARSEILLES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CHARACTERS. Francis I. King of France. Raymond, Count Chateaubriant, Governor of Marseilles. Bramville, An old Officer, his Uncle.

      <field name="fulltext">THE TIME. Less than Twenty-four Hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Count Raymond's Castle. After Sun set. Count Raymond and Ronsard advancing. RAYMOND. Yes, Ronsard, ere to-morrow noon my Country Shall triumph o'er her Foes. But whence these Sounds Of Feast and Joy, that echo from my Towers! Whence round my Gate these Soldiers filed in Rank RONSARD. The Admiral of France, my Lord, commands them, And see, he beckons us. RAYMOND. Yes, I perceive him. Forgive my Lordâthe unexpected Blaze [to the Adm. And Voice of Revelry has stunn'd my Thoughts. âAlas, my Lord, Ill suits this sacred House with guardless Riot! In times like these, beneath the open Sky, The Night dew dropping from his dangling Curls, The Soldier should out watch the peeping Stars Of chilly Dawn. But here, O Shame to Manhood! Perfum'd and shuddering at the drizzly Shower, Beneath the gilded Roof, the silken Warrior Of these degenerate Days in wanton Luxury Unstrings his feeble Sinews! Oh my Country! Forgive my wandering Passionsâhaste, my Lord, If as my Heart misgives me, if my Sovereign Here lost in Revel wastes the unvalued Hours, Haste lead me to him; Bourbon's, my Country's Fate, Hang on my Lips. LORD ADMIRAL. Bourbon, my Lord, Is fled, confused as from a total Rout. RAYMOND. Ha, Bourbon fledâDestruction to my Country Follows that thin delusionâWhere is my Sovereignâ LORD ADMIRAL. Mark me, my Lord; this keen Impatience suits not Your present Danger. RAYMOND. Danger to me peculiar! Yet say, where lies it. LORD ADMIRAL. In the King's Displeasure, For this your Disobedience, which your Foes, May vaump in Treason's Garb. RAYMOND. Be plain, my Lord, You speak a Language to my Heart unknown. LORD ADMIRAL. And plain then be it: Here, my Lord, your Presence Is disobedience: Your commanded Duty Calls you to other Station. RAYMOND. Darker still Are these ambiguous WordsâA Soldier's Duty, My King's Command I never disobey'd. LORD ADMIRAL. The King, when Bourbon fled, sent his Command That Raymond still should guard Marseilles' torn Walls, Lest Bourbon's Flight be only Stratagem, Till he himself to-morrow Noon reliev'd him. Such the Command: and Raymond now stands here In Act of daring Disobedience. RAYMOND. Ah now, the dreary Gleam, As of a funeral Torch, breaks thro' the Darkness That veil'd your Words. But Raymond were a Traitor Were he not here, and earnest to demand An Audience of his Sovereign; tell him Count Raymond Has left Marseilles; tell him his Crown depends On my immediate AudienceâNo, myself Shall bring Conviction. LORD ADMIRAL. That my Lord were Treason In me, in these, not to prevent. RAYMOND. What Madness this! what thriftless waste of Time, The Sword has nobler WorkâAnd instantly, I will have Audience. LORD ADMIRAL. Yet, brave Raymond hear. First, let me tell him that important Reasons Have brought you here: but as you love your Country, First let me urge the Reasons that perswade Myself, ere to your Sovereign unprepar'd, Unthank'd I bring you. RAYMOND. Thankless it shall not be; And speed, Lord Admiral, as you would spurn The Name of Traitorâ [Ex. Lord Admiral. Ronsard, in your Eye [to Ronsard. I read Amazementâin myself I feel An unform'd Horror, and ill-boding Darknessâ Oh my ErminiaâAll gracious Heaven, Where am I lost! RONSARD. My Friend, my better Father! O good my Lord, far from your generous Heart Be these vile Terrors. RAYMOND. Ere the sacred altar, Witness'd her plighted faith, my lov'd Erminia Plighted her troth, and I esteemed it sacred, For by her love she vow'd, never to grace The Court of Valois. When the extacy Of love's completion was a new existence, When all the passion of that generous time Fires the affections, and each melting wish But glows to please, she read my secret thought, And fondly promised never in my absence To give her presence to the passing guest. Yet this dread nightâ RONSARD. To night, my Lord, the King Commands your castle. RAYMOND. And I know him well, I feel some leaden hand invisible, Weigh down my freezing heartâWhere the Kite hovers, The quarry lies in viewâSoon Bourbon's thunder Shall sound another peal, than that which now Kindles this lust inspiring revelry. Yet ere I warn my Sovereign of his danger, Ere for my country I can draw my sword. My Heart's sole treasure, my Erminia's safety, Must to my heart be firm assur'dâTill then The King I see not. In the bower that shades My Chapel wall, I wait, till you good Ronsard, Bring me my aged Uncle, honour'd Bramville; His words I'll trust. Oh speed; my spouse, my country, Urge violent speed.â [Exit Ronsard. âBase world, how dost thou teem With foul events! Justice and every service Are all mere cob-web films to bind the hands Of Lust and Tyranny! Good Heaven, what dangers Frown dreadful on me! O Erminia, Wilt thou prove false! Away, the thought is treason. Their witch like creeping arts affect not thee, Yet oft with pain and fear have I beheld A little, wayward, giddy levity, Shew its capricious features in the midst Of thy endearments, while the languid sigh, And eye disatisfied, would tell the wish For courtly grandeur. Ah, my boding heart! Away, these cruel and ungenerous thoughtsâ Yet fear gnaws deepâthe King; ay that admits No hesitationâ SCENEâA Room in Raymond's Castle. The King, the Lord Admiral, and Duke of Guise. KING. And Raymond here in breach of our command? My Lords, beware, the vengeance of a King Falls heavy on Deceivers. You have told me Of Raymond's beauteous LadyâAll you told Drew but a faded picture of her charms: So lovely she outshines description, But you have added, that she might be won. You give me sweetest poison, and you promise Its rapturous antidote. The poison kindles A wild delirium; but the blissful cure Exceeds all art to compass. All she feels Is passion for her husband. I have seen her, And hopeless rage is mine GUISE. All tenderness, Melting with grief she seem'd, but the keen taste Of joy is sister to the soft enthusiasm Of melting sorrow; open is her temper; Lively and delicate her fancy glows. Then doubt it not, but sprightly levity Pants in her Breast. If I know ought of woman, Such one is to be wrought on. KING. You have told me Raymond's proud heart might by a King be soften'd, And high advancement next to sovereign rank Shall bribe his patience. If you here deceive me, Dreadful shall burst the storm. And Raymond's pride I dread alike as his Erminia's hate, Invincible. LORD ADMIRAL. Yet hear, my Leige; Ambition is the raging fire that burns The heart of Raymond. KING. Honour lives in his breast; His Soul is more than Roman. Tho' my happiness Be plac'd perhaps at mortal strife with his, My heart delights to pause upon his virtues; What his bold sword has done, what wounds he bears, Young as he is, earn'd nobly in my battles! Long have the shatter'd walls of lorn Marseilles Defy'd the traitor Bourbon's fiercest rage. And had not Raymond thus oppos'd his course, Paris ere now had seen the daring rebel Campt at her gates. Fierce Bourbon now is sled To Italy; such circumstance we owe To Raymond's bold defence. LORD ADMIRAL. Yet has he left His shatter'd walls in breach of fixt command And as a spy, comes lurking here. KING. Lord Admiral, I read your untold counsel; punish that crime. Yes, I will punish it: But he who first Advises favours as the way to conquer, Then fearful of his promise urges rigour, To me seems deep in guilt. Each various art Of war is Bourbon's: and perhaps his flight Is only feign'd. Were sudden injury Pour'd now on RaymondâAh, beneath my banners Blunted were many a spear; so well esteemed, So lov'd he reigns in ev'ry Soldier's heart. Yet shall I yield the dearest happiness! And shall my Soul that never knew to humble, Coldly and humbly too resign the hope Of all I wishâAlas, my fever'd heart With anguish'd longing seeks the fair One's presence, Tho' not a smile repay my ardent love. Here wait our willâ [Exit King. LORD ADMIRAL. Your plots, young Lord, are turn'd Like arrows on their masters. Raymond's valour Is now the King's sole theme of praise and wonder; And Raymond's power portends our hopeless fall Was it for this, my Guise, we rooted out The haughty Bourbon from the King's affections, That ere they cool'd, his place might be supplied By this affected Roman! GUISE. Every failure That Jealousy's prophetic Eye may dread, Our care has shunn'dâ LORD ADMIRAL. When comes a smooth-faced Boy, Squeamish with honesty, vaumpt with the feathers By thoughtless courage gain'd: And, Oh disgrace Tears from the hoary Politician's brow The civic wreath, and plants it on his own GUISE. No, Fortune ever is the slave of wisdom; Bold, let us hope. LORD ADMIRAL. Loud and audaciously, Tis, said he, brands the Court: Bourbon he calls A gallant Man much injured. GUISE. And may silence Still close that strain. Raymond bears every gallant Virtue's semblance So taking with the King. But wound his honour, Unbridled as the northern storm, his rage Bursts headlong, nor subsides till justice soothe His rankled pride, LORD ADMIRAL. Oh hence, that hope of women, That builds its trust on what another's honour May please to do; give sovereign power to Raymond, And ev'n to Grooms, he yields his lovely Countess. What works we fondly thought to raise against him, Serve but as steps to lift him up to greatness KING. My Lord, there is a wisdom cold and watchful, Much of itself approved, that calmly triumphs O'er what the simple name the gen'rous passions. This wisdom headlong Raymond never knew Oft in the camp I've read his furious madness; Calm prudence never veil'd his mind's affection. If the fierce Lioness unmov'd, will slumber, While from her side her howling whelps are torn By Shepherds curs, then will the heart-changed Raymond Calmly resign his Countess. LORD ADMIRAL. But the King As wildly great in generous nobleness, Will neverâcannot, thus o'erwhelm in Ruin, The man his soul admires. GUISE. By cool design, Perhaps he cannot: But he little dreads How female charms o'erpower him. All he feels Is wild delirium then; and his high spirit Disdains each bound which then would check his Fire From viewing Bourbon's camp this morn I led him To Raymond's gates: the wood-embosom'd Castle Presented to his mind the gallant lovers And ladies of Romance. Here's some adventure, Cried the pleased King. LORD ADMIRAL. And did not you extol The Lady of the mansion's wondrous charms? GUISE. I named her passing beauty; but I named it With careless voice. The unexpected blaze Strikes to the soulâfair as the blush of morn, We found her walking pensive in the garden; She, far the loveliest flow'r that flourish'd there; Sorrow was in her eye and melting sweetness; And unsuspicious innocence beam'd round her. O'erpower'd till lost in pausing awkwardness, The King gaz'd on her charms, But when her husband. Was namedâ GUISE. Cold at the heart, methought it struck him With vacant looks as hopeless of his wish; He paus'd and sigh'd; then sudden o'er his cheek The blush of love rush'd out. I mark'd his eye, It brighten'd and it languish'd every moment While roving o'er her charms. LORD ADMIRAL. And was her sorrow The net of love display'd to catch the Lover Who fondly soothes it? GUISE. No; 'twas innocence, Artless, yet easy to be gently won. Some fearful dreams about her husband's safety Prey'd on her heart; but when the King declar'd Danger was o'er, as Angels smile, she smil'd. And when he talk'd of courtly joys, of grandeur, And beauty's empire, heaven's how the deep sigh Betray'd her fluttering heart.! LORD ADMIRAL. Your spouse, my Lord, Comes with the looks of care. GUISE. Why my Eemoine, why that pensive eye, Where love should only reign! EEMOINE. My Lord, I know not. What means the King; to me he talks of honour, That all his wish is but to favour Raymond; To see the Countess happy at the court, The fairest ornament of Fontainbleau. Pity, indeed, that here amidst these wilds, Such charms, such virtues, as adorn the Countess, Should to the world be lost. But if the King Do plan delusion, gracious Angels guard meâ No; never shall my conscious lips betray Such innocence, such sacred spousal love. 'Twas not in vain, my Lord, you brought me here; Here shall I better learn, tho' well I knew From thee before, to tend the flowers that shed Their soft endearments o'er the sacred bowers Of wedded love. GUISE. And long and happy be your sacred friendship With Raymond's Countess! from these dull retirements Urge her to follow you to courtly splendor; And as your friendship strengthens, be the wish Still melting on your lips, that gallant Raymond Would join strict friendship with your prosp'rous husband. I then were fully happy. EEMOINE. Ever shalt thou be happy, My wedded Lord, if aught my cares avail. The Countess flies the King; I go to soothe her By his command, and bring her to the mask-room GUISE. Such was thy smile, my Fair, when at the altar I seiz'd thy yielding handâ Ex. Eemoine] LORD ADMIRAL. Great in the future tales Of state intrigue, I hail thee, prudent Guise. Thy Spouse, a stranger to thy heart, will act Her part from simple nature, unopposed By female scruples. GUISE. Think not ever woman Shall fathom this deep breast: but well I know, When woman's faith is tamper'd with, Woman must be employ'd: a woman's presence Lulls fear to sleep: a woman's friendly smile Gives silent approbation to the thoughts, As to themselves unknown they warm to passion. LORD ADMIRAL. Cautious, yet fearless too must we hold on. Where fear prevails no bold emprize succeeds. I hasten to the King: do thou find Raymond, And fire him to the mood of our desires. [Exeunt SCENEâAn Arbour by an old Chapel. Raymond and Bramville RAYMOND. The King and Guise this morning at my castleâ BRAMVILLE, Yet hear, my Lordâ RAYMOND. Saw my Erminia! and now are with her Holding heir revelry. O woman's honour, Poor glittering vapour, bursting at the touch Of first intruder! BRAMVILLE. 'Twas the King, my Lord, Twas he intruded: in the Cypress Grove By chance he met her: to the silent shade Mournful she fled, to give her bleeding heart The fainting ease and luxury of sorrow. For thee, brave Raymond, bled her faithful heart. In each sad life-throb. Fearful images Of thee, stretch'd pale and breathless on the ground, Haunted her tortur'd fancy: when the King Affirm'd your safetyâas an April sun Smiles through the weeping clouds, she smil'd and glow'd With sudden joy. But soon the pale-lipt sigh Confest the cold return of doubtful fear. The King's officious kindness seem'd ungrateful To her pain'd heart: and soon indeed she left him. All noon she linger'd pensive by the window, Whence seen in distant view Marseilles' grey towers, And Bourbon's camp held her attentive eye: Loud roar'd the war, and hissing thro' the air, The bombs shower'd on the city. At the burst Of ev'ry groaning volley were her eyes And hands held up to heaven; Oh spare my husband! Wildly she cried, in all the strength of terror; Then would have swoon'd; but waken'd by another, And still another roar of Bourbon's thunder. Oh spare my Raymond, heaven! she still exclaim'd; Till silence with the evening sudden closed The dreadful dayâ RAYMOND. Oh, what a treasure, gracious heaven, is mine! Yes; I could weep, and all my heart is pour'd O'er my Erminia's generous painâmy heart Upbraids itself for its dishonest fears. But speed thee, Bramville, bring my tender fair one Where, unprofan'd by these gay revellers' eyes, Here in the sacred Chapel, I may fold her In my enraptur'd arms, and vow my love, Ere on the battle-field I meet the foe From whence, Heaven knows, if e'er my steps return. BRAMVILLE. I speed, my Lord. RAYMOND. Hah, what ill-boding omen! My heart's dire dreadâ Enter the King, Guise, and Lord Admiral. KING. What councils hold you here in these lone shades? Raymond, thy brave protection of Marseilles Receives our thanks; but our command bade Raymond Guard well his shatter'd walls against surprize; Nor leave Marseilles 'till we ourself reliev'd him. But thou art here: How stands thy loyalty? Our will was never disobey'd in vain. RAYMOND. My presence here, my Liege attests my loyalty More than the numerous wounds thy battles gave me. Two months has Bourbon pour'd his rage upon me; Two months my walls have stopt his march thro' France: Three nights and days successive, has his thunder Pour'd on my city, when at last your Highness Came to the rescue of Marseilles and France. Then Bourbon fled; and rushing from my towers, I dar'd the column where his ensign stream'd. Himself I took not, tho' my spear was near him: Yet some I made my prisoners; one of these Carried this letter. [Gives it to the King, who soon gives it to Guise. To Marseilles I sent My brave Lieutenant: to my Sovereign's camp, (Other command of duty unreceived), I sped to warn him of to-morrow's war. Tho' wild confusion mark'd the flight of Bourbon. The rising sun shall see his army marshall'd In dread array offering their iron front. Off with these silken robes and cap of velvet; The vest of steel, my Liege, and brazen helmet, Were fitter now KING. Raymond, such zeal we need not. What Bourbon means we know: our camp expects him. Marseilles demands your presence. âEvery moment Your tarry here upbraids the king who honours you. [Raymond retires.] Good heaven, what mutiny of struggling passions Raged in his eyes, and shook his lingering steps, Foreboding dreadful issue! LORD ADMIRAL. On himself Will ever fall the evil. GUISE. This the order [holding the letter in his hand] Of Bourbon to his generals may be wrought By jealous Raymond: His ill-boding care Secludes his Countess with such jealousy, As if he meant these lonely shades should guard The wanton rays of summer's genial suns From playing round her. KING. Yet, much care behoves us. Speed to the camp, Lord Admiral, and give Our fixt command; let all in silent care Lie under arms to-night. No sudden danger Forbids the gay festivity, ordain'd To win the angel Countess. 'Twere impiety To love's coy God to slip so fair a season. GUISE. Behold, my Liege, with what a pleasing lustre The star of Venus twinkles o'er the bowers Inspiring love, as if she bade the lover Steal to his mistress. KING. Every thought presents me The lovely fair oneâAh, what tenderness, What warmth of soul, beneath her innocence, Artless appear'd! GUISE. If such dear scenes of transport Rise in enamour'd fancy, think what transport, While now the moon gleams thro' the lonely grove Making the Primrose paler, while the gale Wispers love sighs, to wander with the goddess, Who gives the inspiration. KING. Oh, name it not. I am all fireâYes, I shall die or conquer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENEâA Room in the Castle. Erminia and Eemoine. ERMINIA. Ah, name not brilliant shew and courts to me! These peaceful shades, and holy calm retirements, Whene'er my gallant Raymond's presence glads them, Have every charm: delights how far superior To gaudy flutter and incumber'd grandeur! On yon green bank, laved by the murmuring rill, How have I sat enraptur'd, while my hero Renew'd his joyful vows, and prais'd his happiness! The envious Sun has stolen away unnoticed, And the melodious warbler of the evening Has sung unhear'd beside me while he talk'd; For all my ear was love. O Raymond, Raymond, When shall these dreadful wars again restore thee! When shall our wonted bowers hear thee again Display the raptures of thy faithful heart! Oh, heaven restore my Raymond to my arms! EEMOINE. Heaven hears the prayer. Still on Marseilles' proud wall Waves the red banner, and still lives my Lord, The Governor. ERMINIA. He livesâperhaps he does not. If yet he live, to-morrow brings new danger. Oh, I am full of fearful apprehensions! I fear, alas!âwhat thousand fleeting phantoms! I fear his valourous thoughtless scorn of danger More than a thousand foes. EEMOINE. A brave man only, Lady, Had charms for you; and would you wish your Lord To shun the toils that give him all his charms? And ever sacred be this wood-land castle, And these lone bowers, to love, to happiest love! And soon may Raymond cheer his lone retreat! Yet sprightly youth by nature's powerful motion Asks other scenes; would mingle in the walks Where other Peers lead forth their fairest dames. ERMINIA. I cannot love the scene my Raymond loves not. All the endearments of the expecting lover Still seem more tender; yet should I but hint Of leaving these retreats, and name the Court, Serious he looks, then smiling says, the world Is all false shew, and full of real trouble; That a calm haven, like ours, is all the wish Of courts and camps; the pole star of ambition. Love makes me say so too, when sparkling rapture His eyes confess his dearest wish accomplish'd; The while he labours to express his joy, And tells me I have freely granted him The only point he could refuse to yield me. EEMOINE. Yet the full tide of Raymond's rising honours Now swell so high, it cannot, will not leave him To these lone shadesâTalk'd not the King this morn As if he wish'd the Count would change his life, And shew the Court his Countess? ERMINIA. Ah, Eemoine, Raise not that hope; away! it shall not please me. EEMOINE. And most auspiciously occasion offers, Bourbon is fled, by Raymond's valour baffled; And France is sav'd. This night the joyful King, With many a lady from the neighbouring castles, In Raymond's castle means to celebrate The nation's joy in honour of your husband. Should Raymond's Countess sullen then refuse To grace the public joy, her husband's honour Were tainted by the deed. ERMINIA. Three dreadful nights and days Has Bourbon pour'd his thunder on Marseilles. No sleep the while my woeful eyelids clos'd. My fever'd thoughts at last, in gentle slumber, Methought were sooth'd, when on the ground before me A pale and blood-stain'd corpse my husband lay. 'Twas not a dream, I saw himâ EEMOINE. The sick man's dreams of dismal yawning gulphs Cleaving beneath his feet, and volleying fire, Are real all, compar'd to what fond love Conceives, when fear, as on the whirlwind's wing, Toffesthe fancyâAh, bethink you, lady, How ill your fears become your opening fortunes. Whom Fortune once forsakes, him almost never She visits more; but when her various bounty Flows on her favourites, the Spring's gay blossoms Crowd not so plenteous on the May-day thorn; So full she comes, where she delights to come. She now, your better angel, smiles upon you, And bids you follow her; see, where she leads To courtly brilliancy, and royal favour! ERMINIA. Ah, didst thou feel like me, and hadst, like me, The husband of thy love three days in battle? Perhaps, ev'n now, torn from my widow'd arms, On the rude earth his cold pale cheek reclines! Didst thou fear this, alas, thou couldst not talk Of Fortune's smiles, and Grandeur's gaudy baubles! Enter the King, Guise, and Officers. KING. Ah! still in tears?âLet Winter's dismal gloom O'ercloud the smiles of May, but let not sorrow Dim these bright eyes. ERMINIA. Forgive, my LiegeâHither, for pity's sake! Support me, lady. [retiring. KING. What, and fly me too! And can so fair a bosom veil such rigour! ERMINIA. Oh pity my distress, my woman's fears! KING. The brave Count Raymond lives, and crown'd with glory! ERMINIA. Oh heaven repeat itâDoes the rage of war Threaten no more?âHere, from the camp, I see, Are other Peers; but what detains my Raymond? Alas, deceive me not, nor mock my fears! EEMOINE. Thy fears are but the terror of a dream, That soon will vanish. ERMINIA. Ah, the dreadful battle Is past; and these return'd from victory; But death detains my Raymond! Never, till now, Was he the last to hasten to my arms. Thy Guise is here; Eemoine, but my Raymond Lies bleeding on the field. I know his ardour: The dearest joy he felt in war's proud triumph Was to behold my transport, when my arms Receiv'd him from the fields of death, restor'd To life, to loveâBut now, Oh heaven! he comes not, Though others come. KING. By the King's sacred honour! Thy Raymond lives; and every tongue delights To name his gallant deeds. To-night is sacred To his renown, which you will more adorn. The Court of Charlemagne, in all its pomp Of beauteous ladies, when they sat to judge Their Knights at martial Tournay, yields to mine The palm of beauty. War's confus'd alarms Are now expell'd our realmâFestivity Now claims the heartâThen might I thus to-night, For one short night, thus beg your hand, and call you Queen of the mask. ERMINIA. Alas, my Liege, my terrors O'erpower my soul!âHither, Eemoine, aid me. KING. Ah, Madam!âYes, indeed, had you refus'd me,â All dull impertinence, the face of joy. Had seem'd to meâ [Eemoine retires, the Countess as lost in hesitation.] The cares of war, now like my humble vassals, Stand off at servile distance, while I give My heart to riot in the sweetest joys That victory affords; the sovereign joys That beauty's captivating power inspires, When beauty smiles with all the dear distinctions That valour gains from womanâ [Guise taking the Countess by the hand.] GUISE. Here, my Liege, The fairest gem that ever France acquir'd From all her wars, to grace her splendid Court. ERMINIA. Ha, what! forbearâI know not what you said. My spirits hurry me, I know not whither! [withdrawing. I break my plighted honour while I talk And linger hereâWhate'er my Raymond means, I would not wound him in his earnest wish, So oft repeated, were the world to give [Eemoine returns All it admires to bribe me. Why, Eemoine, Why leave me thusâHither my childhood's friend. [offering to retire. KING. Yet hear how vain is your oppressing sorrow. EEMOINE. The gallant Raymond, crown'd with fresh blown honours, Safe from the war this instant glads his castle. His country's cause commands his present care, And soon the honours of to-night's festivity Shall give him to your arms with doubled joy. Highly elated with the royal favour, He means to meet you at the happy mask; Such duteous honour to his King he owes, And longs to payâ ERMINIA. Oh, not an angel's voice Could thus have darted through my lifted heart So bright a glow of transport. Oh my Raymond! What have I suffer'd from the dreams of fear! Yes; thy love-smiles shall fondly brighten o'er me While I in sweet remembrance tell my fears. KING. Now, by my crown! these looks of happy beauty Repay the hardships of a whole campaign. The Ladies and the Peers already crowd The joyful mask room, and attend their King; But happiness delays her inspiration, Lady, till you appear. [Exeunt together. SCENEâAn Apartment in the Castle. Enter Bramville and Ronsard meeting. BRAMVILLE. Say, have you found him?âDeaf to all my prayers, He spurns when I urge his instant safety, Here, here, he lingers in the act of treason. RONSARD. And vain is all I urge of hope and patience; Vain as his earnest wish to see the Countess. He well perceives she's guarded. But this instant He sprung away, and vow'd that not the King Should guard the door that placed its bar between them. Enter Guise and Lord Admiral. GUISE. And know'st thou, Bramville, how thy furious Nephew Defies the King's high will, deserts his station Even in the foe's proud face? His fate is mark'd In bloody characters. BRAMVILLE. Ay, and his foes Will speed the blowâAlas, I know it wellâ [Ex. Bram. and Ron. LORD ADMIRAL. Now is the moment, Guise. Tell me no more What Raymond's love will do, and boasted honour; Speed! instant to the King! and bring commission To seize the lingering traitor. GUISE. On ourselves Thus shall we call destruction. Raymond's Countess Yet loves her husband with a bride's devotion; And should his fate ev'n wound her with a sigh, The love-intoxicated King would spurn us, Degraded from his presence. Yes, my Lord, I'll trust the workings of the Count's fierce honour. Enter Eemoine. EEMOINE. My Lord, oh speed!âFierce Raymond, on the instant, Will burst into the mask roomâ GUISE. Ay, and there, Fierce as a tyger, let him meet his spouse! The kingly lion will not yield his prey: Yes, let the Monarch curse his rude intrusion And from the ferment of their mounting passions, Our's be the gainâHa! while I speak it happens, Uproar and wild confusion at the mask Seal what I hoped. They bring the fainting lady: Let us withdraw, my Lordâ [Ex. Guise and Ld. Admiral. Erminia, supported by Attendants, Eemoine advancing. EEMOINE. Hah, yet she lives!âand have I basely done it?â Mercy, sweet heaven!âam I the blinded agent Of adamantine hearted treachery? Ah, these pale looks upbraid my ministry! Yet, yet I knew notâOh, my friend Erminia! Cast not the look of terror thus around thee: Here each awaits to soothe thy sudden woe Whate'er its grief. ERMINIA. Oh, how severely did his look upbraid My breach of promise! Fiercest indignation Lower'd in his eye, and wither'd in his heart, Each soft, each dear remembrance! whither shall I, Oh, whither turn me! EEMOINE. All around you, Lady, Shall yet smile gay. The King, the generous Francis Shall guard your happiness. ERMINIA. The KingâAh me! Piercing with coldest horror, comes the voice That bids me hope that kindness from another I only wish from RaymondâOh, ungenerous Have I requited himâone test of love. Oft he implor'd with all the rage of earnestness, And I, unworthy of a love like his, Have carelessly neglected that poor test. Yet to my Raymond shall I only fly; E'en tho' he spurn me with a sterner look, Yet will I hold him to my trembling breast, My foe and only friend, my dread and refuge. Where has my Raymond fled meâ Enter Guise. GUISE. Weep not lady; Other resentments, noble ones, should heave The indignant sighâAnd Raymond shall lamentâ ERMINIA. Raymond lament! Oh pitying heaven defend him! My careless breach of promise has involved him In death's dark paths. Ay, death was in the frowns The King and Raymond lower'd upon each other. Yet will I now repeat my breach of promise, And humbly grasp the frowning monarch's knees, Till his high dignity forgive my husbandâ GUISE. Generous lady, Thou art thy Raymond's better Angel, sent From heaven to save himâ [Exeunt. SCENEâAnother Apartment. Guise and his Lady. EEMOINE. Thus, on my knees, by heaven's eternal grace, My Guise, my Husband, I adjure thee tell me, Tell me, what means this earnestness to win Erminia to the Court?âbeneath this kindness Lurks an ambiguous darkness; whence the horror That shakes ev'n Raymond's knees, and chills his Countess As death's cold touch? GUISE. Stern Raymond's wayward humour Thus beats the air, and o'er his hapless spouse Acts the dread Lord; to save his gentle lady From this wild tyranny, were heaven's own kindness Were worthy noblest friendship. EEMOINE. Ah, my Lord, Her woes are all the woes of tenderest love, And shall I act the part which you impose, And add despair to anguish? No; forbid it, Oh gracious heaven! GUISE. And thus a woman's weakness Must blight the fairest harvest of my hopes. Distraction, madnessâ EEMOINE. Yet, my Lord, yet hear; I dreadâAlasâ GUISE. Few be my wordsâThe King In wildest admiration views the bravery Of gallant Raymond: Raymond soon will shine The first high-favour'd subject of the world; And Raymond is my foeâUnless your friendship With his lov'd Countess win me into favour, Disgrac'd and banish'd from the court, our castle In Normandy's wild hills, to you, to me, Will soon become a lonely gloomy prisonâ You tremble at the thoughtâBe wise; prevent it; Be the bold friend of Raymond's injured Countess. Give her the noblest gift a friend can give; Teach her to vindicate her independence, Leave to her gratitude the rest; and thou, Be grateful too: remember the lone cloyster From which my youthful love brought thee to grandeur. [Ex. Guise. EEMOINE. I well remember it: thy dreary castle In Normandy needs only to be nam'd, And the dark cloyster's wintery shades return, Where, lost to hope, my mounting soul seem'd fix'd To a condition rooted to the earth As the base weed that creeps on the cold rock; Where, if at times my generous mind presag'd The courtly scenes of grandeur and of joy, Dependance, like a stern stepmother, blotted The beauteous prospect, and sunk down my heart In cold despairâYes, I remember these; And, were I spouse to Raymond, would not yield To his ungenerous thraldom! Be my friendship To Raymond's Countess then, such as myself, In her lorn hours, would wishâ [Exit. SCENEâAnother Apartment. Bramville and Raymond. BRAMVILLE. Indeed, my Lord, indeed your headlong passion Has rudely injur'd the most faithful spouseâ RAYMOND. My breast was torn with fierce conflicting passions, And still is torn. Oh Bramville! speed again, Tell my Erminiaâ BRAMVILLE. Bourbon, my Lord, Perhaps ev'n now, ranges his host for battle; Your Country asks your swordâ RAYMOND. And witness, Heav'n, I tremble for her fate yet, yet I will not, I will not leave defenceless innocence Beneath the wolf's hot eye. If you would arm me To fight my country's battles, find me access To my Erminia. BRAMVILLE. I speed, my Lordâ [Ex. Bramville. RAYMOND. Oh woman, woman, what may fix thy liking! Good heav'n, what tenderness, what ardent passion The yielding virgin's honest blush betrays! But ah, how soon that honesty expires! And to the first gross flatterer that assails, Wanders her poison'd fancy; in affliction, As light and changeful as the gaudy fly Which hastens to the rose with eager speed, And on its damask leaves, with fond embrace, Flutters her painted wings a little while. A little while, for lift she but her eyes And the first thistle flower that catches them, Catches her fancy too, and thither speeds she. Oh Heaven what haggard imperfection blots Thy fairest work! Enter Ronsard. RONSARD. The troops, my Lord, you sent me to prepare, Are all on fire to think you'll lead themâHa, How dark and wild that look! RAYMOND. Give me your hand. Is this an honest hand? RONSARD. Unstain'd, my Lord. RAYMOND. Away! the world is falseâ RONSARD. Good heaven, my friend! RAYMOND. An old hag once told me, That my friend's hands should tear my heart, should read Each string, and while it wrung the master-cord, With sleek adulterous smiles, should mock my woes. RONSARD. Oh heaven, let me confront the daring traitor, Whose poisonous tongueâ RAYMOND. Alas, Ronsard, thy manners Have beauteous innocence. My thoughts were roving, Were warm, my friend, warm with an ancient tale, A noble one: brave Cyrus had a captive, The pride of beauty; for the King's own bed The chiefs reserv'd her: mark, she was a captive Taken in war, the very flow'r of beauty. But she was chaste, pure as the snow-rob'd angel That guards the holy altar: every thought Glow'd with her husband; cold as death's chill hand To all the world beside. Yet she was woman; And love might hope. But Cyrus made no revel, No mid-night mask, no flattering amorous fondling To fan her pride, or melt her guardless heart. Ay, and her husband was the soe of Cyrus, In arms against him; mark, he was an enemy, But gallant Cyrus reverenc'd his love, And to his arms restor'd the beauteous maid, Pure as th' ethereal blushes of the dawn. Enter Bramville. BRAMVILLE. My Lord, the keen impatience of your fears Is the worst foe that wars against your spouse, Eemoine soon will soothe your mind to peace. RAYMOND. Eemoine, not Erminia! BRAMVILLE. Your fiery glances struck your fond Erminia As withering light'ning; by Eemoine's lips She begg'd some little space for slow recovery; But to the chapel: here your stay is treason; Here may some spy betray you. RAYMOND. Struck her, said you? Sweet heaven, what hope dwells here! Guilt lifts the harden'd front against the injur'd. [as slowly retiring. She's innocent! then henceâ âYet this Eemoine Is spouse of GuiseâA courtier, who could calmly To death and infamy consign the friend Who stood in his ambition's darkling way, And smile too while he stabb'd himâ [Exeunt. SCENEâAnother Apartment. The King, Guise, and the Lord Admiral. KING. My Lords, my happiness demands your service. The CountessâOh what charms! but go, my Guise, I left her trembling on the giddy whirl Of various passions. Fan her, least suspicions Of Raymond's hatredâTell her his dread revenge Should bid her delicate resentment blaze. Then let the powers of music soothe her spirits: I'll follow you: when the dissolving soul Glows in her eyes, the melting melody Shall softly whisper what my looks would say. [Ex Guise And you, Lord Admiral, in every passage Plant armed soldiers: have a watchful eye On Raymond.â LORD ADMIRAL. And in iron chains secure him. KING. No, by my crown: to seize him yet were death To the most lovely fair one. I have promised, Tho' with affected shyness, to forgive him. Heavens, how my feign'd reluctance fired her earnestness, And fixt her keen imploring eyes upon me! Tho' to my love her words spoke cold despair. 'Twas luxury to read her asking eyes Thus languishing on me. And again, Soon shall they woo me, while my lingering favour Shall be the trammel of the god of love. Her husband must be purchased. Hither Lord Admiral. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENEâAn Apartment in Raymond's Castle. Guise and Lord Admiral. LORD ADMIRAL. By all we wish, my Lord, your boasted arts Have weigh'd us down. The King decrees the height Of power and favour to the haughty Raymond. Distraction, death! mild as the April eve Soon shall the tempest of his dreadful rage Gently subside; and we fallen, fallen lowâ GUISE. When Bourbon drove your proud superior host In headlong rout before him; when brave Raymond, With but a van-guard on Marseilles torn walls Stopt the fierce torrent of his forward course; Then were we placed on ruin's giddy brink; Yet shall my arts to firmest ground restore us. Such giddy madness shall my arts inspire, That not three little days on power's high column Shall Raymond stand. You to the King, my Lord. My spouse, why thus distress'd, my fair Eemoine? [Exit Ld. Admiral. Enter Eemoine. Why these sad dubious looks? EEMOINE. Alas, my Guiseâ GUISE. 'Tis thus the fearful, trembling with distrust, Unfit to snatch her gifts, turn fortune from them. The bold command her favours. EEMOINE. Gracious powers! What am I doing? Where will these plots end? I told Count Raymond how severely struck, By his fierce eyes, his faithful Countess lay In death-like swoonings at the neighbouring convent, And by his wishes for her life, adjured him Not to intrude again till I had soothed her. And have my lips, by thee instructed, Guise, Utter'd dark falsehoodâHorrid is the darkness Where treachery dwells, where every glympse of light Is dreadful as the thunder flashâ GUISE. Hail blessed Saint! O well these passions suit the cloyster's cells. Thus when the holy sisters chant their Vespers Beneath the dark ailed Abbey's gloomy roofs, What time the grass-grown creviced window pours The sullen evening's melancholy rays O'er the surrounding tombs; there, fitting place, There shall you chant these holy notes, till age Furrow these blooming cheeks with sallow wrinkles, The church-yard ravens on the blasted elms Nightly responsive to the holy song! EEMOINE. Oh good, my Lord, forbear the dreadful prospect! My life blood freezesâ GUISE. Dreadful tho' it be To youth and beauty form'd like thine to shine Amid the world's applause and courtly splendor; Yet, if perversely you reject my wish That springs from love, and fondly hopes to save you From living burial in a cloyster's walls, A cloyster's dismal haunts must waft your sighs On every evening gale. EEMOINE. And must your love Be purchased with the crimes of treachery? Oh heaven, where am I tost! GUISE. You talk of crimes; I offer virtues; but you want ambition. 'Tis the peculiar virtue taught in courts To serve a stubborn friend by kind deceit. Such the deceit that to the court would bring The sullen Raymond's Countess. âAll the grandeur By Bourbon lost shall soon be worn by Raymond, His jealousy and love are both to madness. If still Erminia in these castle walls Remain the prisoner of his jealous love, What friend shall with the potent Raymond plead For falling GuiseâYour tongue has utter'd falsehood. Now to retreatâ EEMOINE. The world would curse that falsehood, That dark unfinish'd kindness. To complete it, The world shall praise the boldness of my friendship Erminia shall be taught to vindicate The generous freedom which is now denied her. Trust me, my Lord, I'll fan each secret wish That to herself unknown aspires to grandeur. The spark shall flameâ GUISE. By all our hopes and lovesâ [Ex. Guise EEMOINE. Ay, by my hopes! you said, I want ambition: 'Tis now awake, and you shall mark its powers. Thy patrimony, Guise, requires the mines Of place and power to give the splendid pomp Which I aspire toâThese shall be my gift, The noble dowry which my art shall bring. [Exit. SCENEâAn Apartment in the Castle. Erminia and Eemoine. ERMINIA. Music in vain has pour'd its sweetest charms; In vain to me. The bland tranquillity That oft has wrapt me in its downy bosom, When but some shepherd tun'd the rustic lay Came not as wont; and melody but rais'd My struggling passions. What a dreadful war Tears my tempested bosom! Raymond's hatred, Loftily dreadful and ungenerous, Fires my resentment; when a sickly horror Freezes my heartâAh, once my Raymond lov'd me! Once loved me!âWhat a painful weight of anguish This struggle to repay his scorn with scorn Pours o'er my spirits. Tell me where, Eemoine, Where is my husbandâ EEMOINE. I have seen stern Raymond. I trembled to behold his writhing lip, And fierce red eye, that as it roll'd shot gleams Of purple lightning. Some dread purpose fills him. I hear'd him mutter death, revenge, and honour. ERMINIA. Oh Heaven, befriend meâI have waked his rage; Where will it end! EEMOINE. And would you tamely stoop To his wild tyrannyâForbid it honour. The honour of the King forbids it, Lady; No dark revenge, no deed of jealous madness, For wrongs ne'er given, shall mark the day with horror, The day when generous Francis with his presence Honour'd stern Raymond's castle. ERMINIA. Bounteous heaven, Oh seal these words! But slow and unresolved Appear'd the King, when I implor'd forgiveness For Raymond's headlong rage. EEMOINE. Yet, fear not, Lady; The generous love a generous confidence; Aught less is insult where we hope for friendship. Give to the Monarch then the welcome care To soothe your husband, and to make your blest. Bourbon's high office courts the haughty Raymond; His rage alone delays his lofty grandeur. Two various fortunes, Lady, wait before you: One in this lonely castle to wear out Your cheerless years; this night's wild jealousy Ever in your husband's mind, and you a prisoner Under severest watch; and visited, Perhaps one day in many a lonely month, By your stern husband, when the toils of state Allow the hurried respite; or, perhaps When old affection wakes; for beauty reigns At Fountainbleau in all its various featuresâ Ah, why that sudden paleness o'er these cheeks! Assume the generous independence, Madam, Your noble birth's due right; and Fountainbleau Offers thee all its joys, and crown of all, Lasting security of independence. To-night these various fortunes are thy vassals, Which to reject or chooseâBut ah, to-morrow They wait thy will no moreâ ERMINIA. My heart to Raymond Was open as the noon-day face of heaven: No dark recess was from his eye conceal'd. But Raymond's love, ev'n in its sofest hours, Like his proud eye, wore something awful.âMan, Stern lordly man, never in perfect union, Joins his superior heart with humbler woman, Though all her heart's affections worship him. The wives of other peers have liberty. For what dark cause am I alone excluded From the fair paradise of Fountainbleau? Why am I here forbidden to behold The face of stranger! EEMOINE. Let the dark veil'd cause Dare the bold light, tho' wrapt in gloomy silence; That speechless cause must waken in the heart Such unform'd thoughts as ne'er can sleep with peace. ERMINIA. That gloomy cause shall dare the light, Eemoine. Alas, with smiles I met him; all my heart Melting and glowing for the mutual smiles That mingle on the looks of dear affection. But he felt other passions; from my arms Half open'd, from my smiles he started back In rage and horror. EEMOINE. And again that rage, As the black thunder cloud, will burst upon you Its gather'd storm. Ah hapless Lady, hear me: Thy honour, happiness, and reconcilement, The King's protection can alone secure. Then trust the generous Monarchâ ERMINIA. Ah, were thy words cloth'd in an unseen substance! I felt them touch my soul with icy finger; My heart bleeds at the touch: my heart remembers Th' unmeasur'd fulness of the confidence With which, in all its griefs, it fled to Raymond. And shall I, from Raymond, to another Fly for protection! NoâI cannot, cannot. Though doubled rage burn in his looks, to him, To him alone my heart feels its attraction. Yes, in his presence the soft sleep of death Shall gently shed its dimness o'er the frowns That kill me; and his pity-melted eyes O'er my cold ashes yet shall shed the tearâ EEMOINE. Ah think you, Lady, how the siner spirits Are torn and fever'd by the violence Of love, of grief, and fear, like your's, unbounded. Imagination then in wildest transport Is all alive; but reason sleeps the while. Would you to Raymond, and beneath his sword Die in a fine delirium, and consign him To everlasting woe! your love to Raymond Did reason guide, would fly him, till his Sovereign Soothe his mistaken pride, and lift him up To highest power and grandeur. ERMINIA. Oh Eemoine, Pity my troubled mind! my soul indeed Is sick and fever'dâ Enter the King. KING. Gracious heav'n, and shall That lovely bosom bleed! No, by my knighthood! Each courtly honour shall be heap'd on Raymond For your sake, Ladyâall, except the throne, Shall fill his wish. ERMINIA. Ah me, what gratitude I oweâYet now, O leave me to my tears, And heaven, a while! KING. Leave thee to tearsâto all The sovereign joys of empire I decree Thy future hours, if these sad tears prevent not. A nobler love, than ever glow'd in shades, And lonely bowers, shall bless thy future days. Enter Guise. GUISE. Tidings, my Liege, The fleet of England rides before the coast Of Normandy. KING. Curst be thy ill tim'd message. Find the Lord Admiral, Guise. One moment, Lady. [Ex. King and Guise. ERMINIA. Raymond forgiven, and rais'd to highest honour! The sudden joy o'erpowers me. Much I owe The generous Monarch. EEMOINE. Thus at Fountainbleau Still happier than the last each day shall rise. Enter Lord Admiral and Guise. LORD ADMIRAL. Though France beholds us high in royal favour, High in the state, to your protection, Lady, We recommend ourselves. ERMINIA. How you amaze me! LORD ADMIRAL. Smile when you name us, and our power is fixt, Our gratitude unbounded. GUISE. Other danger Than of your frown the hoary statesman fears not. [Exeunt Ld. Admiral and Guise. Enter an Old Officer. OFFICER. To beauty half assur'd of fair success, The soldier sues. Forty cold falling harvests Have seen me in the field, and forty summers Have scorch'd this silver'd head in camps and marches. But now, ah Madam, this big heart refuses To tell what now I feelâold and neglected; The base mechanic, at his smoky forge, Eyes me with scorn, and boasts an independence Unknown to me. My heart, my soul, is sick With hoping for redress. ERMINIA. Alas, could I command, Your griefs should yet be heal'd, OFFICER. Our generous Monarch Needs but to hear my tale; and should my sorrows Melt on your lipsâAh heavenâ ERMINIA. I will repeat them, Good, brave old man, I will.â OFFICER. Oh happy France, Whose court can boast an interceding angel? [Ex. Officer. ERMINIA. Are we alone, Eemoine? How my heart Flutters amid this group of crowding joys, So new it scarcely knows them; oft, when wandering Our lonely meadows, has the languid sigh Heav'd my dull bosom, while my thoughts would whisper How sweet it were t' assume the dignity Of courtly rank. EEMOINE. The nestling eagle thus, 'Ere yet his pinions serve him, longs to soar To the bright sun. ERMINIA. And can I still remain insensible, Deaf or unmov'd to hear ev'n reverend office Sue for protection, and to see pale sorrow Turning for help as to a guardian angel! And to bestow that help! Oh these be joys That never enter'd in my lone retirements. Yet should my Raymond still averseâ EEMOINE. The King Will bend thy Raymond's will beneath the load Of highest favours, if thy keen impatience To see him, 'ere his rage be sooth'd, prevent not. The ladies and the peers, the courtly train, Who grace to-night's festivity, will blame Our ill timed absence, Madamâ ERMINIA. Well, let us honour them.âBut, O sweet heaven, What sudden bodings, cold and imageless, Glide thro' my breast! [Exeunt. SCENEâThe Chapel. RAYMOND. Either my mind has lost its energy, Or the unbodied spirits of my fathers, Beneath this night's dark wings, pass to and fro, In doleful agitation, hovering round me. Methought my father, with a mournful look, Beheld me.âSudden from an unconscious pause I wak'd, and but his marble bust was here. Woman, thou slave of gaudy vanity, What trifles win thee! O had heaven but made thee Constant as lovelyâ Enter Ronsard. RONSARD. Where the mind, my Lord, Seeks its own woe, that woe will ever come. And ev'n blank nothingness, when brooded o'er By its creative power, will teem with sorrow. Twice to the spouse of Guise you hurried me. Again she comes t'upbraid your causeless fears. Enter Eemoine. EEMOINE. Your causeless rage, my Lord, will be the herald Of death to your ErminiaâYour frown Once more were instant death. RAYMOND. Oh heav'n, and has my rash unbridled rage Thus torn the gentlest bosom while it glow'd With love and me.âOh 'twas foul sacrilege; Yet 'twas the untam'd force of love that fir'd me. Ay, and I know the KingâGood heaven! and has my frown Thus torn her heart? Bring me, Eemoine, to her, And I, with vows, will beg my faults forgiveness. Haste, instant bring me to her.âWhat, refuse me! EEMOINE. My Lord, you cannot see her in the convent. RAYMOND. Not see her! not the grave shall hide her from me. In this I will be heard. The plunderer, For dread of whom, in these lone shades, I ween'd To hide her from the worldâthat cruel plunderer Is now beneath my roof. Haste, bring me to her. 'Twas not on her I frown'd: 'Tis more than cruel To misinterpret thus my honest passion. EEMOINE. Deeply, my Lord, your generous pain affects me; But if you love your sad Erminia, tarry Till I prepare her.âBe assur'd your fears Are all in vain. Expect me soon, my Lord. [Ex. Eemoine RAYMOND. O speed thee on the wings of generous friendship. Enter Lord Admiral. Ha! hast thou found me here? LORD ADMIRAL. The sullen gloom Of this sepulchral haunt but ill becomes The heir of Bourbon's grandeur. Gallant Raymond, I hail you Lord Constable of France. RAYMOND. 'Tis now blind midnightâ LORD ADMIRAL. Much the King esteems you.â RAYMOND. And the Adulterers softly steal along, Shunning the moon's chaste beam.â LORD ADMIRAL. My Lord High Constableâ RAYMOND. That is not me. LORD ADMIRAL. Not you, brave Raymond! 'tis to your Sovereign's pleasure, Do you accept it then and thank his Grace? RAYMOND. Is that indeed all the return he hopes! Ha, what surpris'dâAh, thou know'st more than I do Enter Bramville. LORD ADMIRAL. Here comes your friend, my Lord, his riper counsel May yet prevail. Ld. Admiral offering to speak, then exit. RAYMOND. No moreâFarewelâ âAnd to my peace farewel. Oh, torture of suspence! One smiling moment, The clouds that blacken o'er my nuptial shrine Disperse, and instant with a darker frown They lower againâ Oh, my Erminia, where thy wonted love That oft has sped thee fondly to my arms, 'Ere from the chace my foot has left the stirrup; Now, now thou sleest me.â BRAMVILLE. Heavens, good my Lord, Is this the time to act the fearful lover, Pensive and idle while your prostrate country Demands the vigour of your arm?âAway This pining jealousy! Our Monarch's crown Now totters on his head, and you can save him. RAYMOND. Had you a bride so flush'd with every charm, And did you love her to idolatry, You could not leave her on the giddy brink Where but one step and she is lost for ever. The KingâCan I be blind to his dark purpose? And shall I fight his battles, oh distraction! While he ascends my bed? BRAMVILLE. Disdain, my Lord, The ungenerous thought: Erminia's virtue sullied! Never, my Lordâand shall you sheath your sword Tho' Bourbon's fate hangs on it? RAYMOND, This ill-omen'd revelry Has sheath'd my sword, and France will bleed for this. Alas, my country! RONSARD. Bourbon's stratagem Of mimick'd flight is, by the festive King, Scorn'd, disregarded. But from his wild riot Bourbon will rouse him soon. Then France is conquer'd. By the pale dawn the thunder of his battle Will give new music to the dancer's whirls. The hour in which your arm would save your country, That sacred hour, now, like an idle tale, Passes away; 'tis goneâ RAYMOND. No; yet I'll seize it. The sacred treasure of my wedded love Is heaven's own care. BRAMVILLE. Erminia's virtue tainted! Impossible.âGods, had I your green youthâ RAYMOND. The King shall on the instant know his danger. Let me command, and Bourbon's stratagem Shall whelm himself in ruin. Oh, to-morrow. Shall shine a glorious day! to-morrow noon The Emperor Charles shall see his laurels wither'd. My soul is up in arms to save my country, And on the instant I will have an audience. [Exeunt. SCENEâAn Apartment in the Castle. The King, Lord Admiral, and Erminia. LORD ADMIRAL. Indeed, my Liege, with proud contempt he spurn'd The royal favour, and with stern command Impos'd upon me silence. ERMINIA. Oh, my Liege, By Heaven's sweet mercyâ LORD ADMIRAL. When the Sovereign stands On unseen danger's brink, he's the best subject Who boldly dares, tho' with a voice unwelcome, To rouse him from his blind security. My Liege, while furious Raymond is unchain'd, Your nation's happiness, your sacred life.â ERMINIA. By Heaven's eternal truth, the faithful Raymond Would die to save his monarch. Let his victories, O let the wounds which mark his faithful breast In this unhappy moment, plead forgiveness! KING. The duty to myself I owe, forgives him; But that dread care I owe my nation, cannot. ERMINIA. Then welcome deathâ [sinks down on the couch. KING. He must not yet be seiz'd. [to the Ld. Admiral who retires. Again the roses to her cheeks return. [placing himself by her. Enter at a distance, Raymond, Bramville and Ronsard. RAYMOND. And is it thus?âO mighty Godâ BRAMVILLE. Soft, burst not in; yet hear, Her faith may yet shine glorious KING. Thus in his tent, beneath the fragrant shades Of Lebanon, while thro' the list'ning wood The turtle's voice was heard, the sapient King Attain'd the summit of his rapt'rous love. ERMINIA recovering. His loveâforget not what you vow'd; his rage Is terribleâAlas! I am no Roman. BRAMVILLE. O yet, my Lordâ [Ray. offering to draw, prevented by Bram. KING. Nor in magnificence To dazzle round my fair, nor in the warmth Of Love's exalted passion, will I yield To Judah's monarchâ ERMINIA. Oh! my Liege remember What Honour's voice inspires, when helpless woman Implores and pleads the sacredness of promise. RAYMOND. She yields, oh hell, with hearty choice! she yields. [to Bramville. Your hand, my Lordâcold horror weakens me. KING. To-night his rage is dreadful; but to-morrow, For your sake, Lady, all, except the throne, Shall soothe his better mind; and should he still Rage on in madness, yet secure protection Shall ever smile around you. RAYMOND advancing. Am I sold then? But cursed be the terms: thy throne, proud Tyrant, Were but a gilded toy if given to bribe My soul's affection, and with scorn rejected. Yet feed, she wolf, feed on to loathing surfeit. [to Erminia, who swoons. O burning indignation prop me! save meâ KING. Proud peer, your duty to your Prince remember. RONSARD. Heavens, 'twas an Angel's fallâ [As Raymond, Bramville, &amp;c. retire. BRAMVILLE. Astonishment Hardens my joints; Oh hence unhappy Raymond. [Exeunt. SCENEâAnother Apartment. Raymond, Ronsard, and Bramville enter. RONSARD. Alas, brave Countâ RAYMOND. Methinks the solid earth Trembles beneath me; yes, let earthquakes yawn, And in the dark abyss ingulf mankind. And am I, am I then that dreadful tyrant 'Gainst whom she calmly stipulates protection? Oh lost Erminia! Oh for the heat of madness to possess me, While I tore off, and trampled on the ensigns Of service to the man who has for ever Murder'd my peace!âThen thus, and thusâyet prostrate [tearing his sash. My country lies. Ah heaven, and could I save her! Oh dreadfulâBut for whom, for whom to save her? For him whose raging lustâ Oh sacred nature, be thy untaught impulse My only law, my peace thy pious fury. Enter Guise. GUISE. Such storm of rage, my Lord, ill fits the duty You owe your royal guest. RAYMOND. Does this disturb him! Thinks he to slumber on my nuptial couch! Amidst his wanton revels he shall know My honour, and my wrongs shall yet have vengeance. Bourbon will soon revenge me.âI have seenâ Oh Heaven, had rather Hell's deep gulph before me Open'd its horrors! GUISE. Yet may time, my Lordâ 'Tis true your Monarch acts the happy lover. Yet time, my Lordâ RAYMOND. And dar'st thou thus insult me, Wrong'd as I amâBut this shall quit thy services [draws his sword. GUISE. O good, my Lordâ RAYMOND. Defend thy heart. GUISE. Hither, this instant seize himâ [calling in soldiers, after whom enter Ld. Adm. RAYMOND. Dare you your general's frown! âAt distance, varlets. LORD ADMIRAL. Not yet, my LordâI bring the King's command, Let him retire. RAYMOND to GUISE. And thou pale dastard, live Some little hours, then curse thyself and die. BRAMVILLE. Oh villany behold thy horrid triumphs! With noble Raymond falls my country too. [Ex. Raymond, Ronsard, and Bramville. GUISE. Now are my hopes of Raymond's wild blind honour, And headlong rage, accomplish'd; trust me, Lord Admiral, The tales we told him of his lov'd Erminia Sicken'd his pride of grandeur. But when now Boldly he threatens that the traytor Bourbon Shall soon revenge his wrongs; now to dismiss himâ LORD ADMIRAL. Francis, my Lord, would e'en resign his crown To win the shy bewitching fair one's smile; And were her Raymond seiz'd, and she to hear it, Her instant death he deems the consequence. The King thus wills a splendid train to-morrow, Soon as the dawn, o'er these wide dales shall rouse The slumbering deer, Erminia must be won To join the band; a feign'd alarm of danger From Bourbon shall afford the apology, Kindly to bear her off to Fountainbleau. Then shall proud Raymond meet the traytor's fate. Eemoine's aid, my Lordâ GUISE. Shall seal our purpose, Tho' now Erminia's gentle love to Raymond Be all live tenderness, yet she is woman. [Exeunt. SCENEâAn Aparment in the Castle. Erminia reclined on a Sopha, Eemoine. ERMINIA. The gentle ministers of Heaven's blest care Have left me; and an unform'd load of horror Spreads an inactive darkness o'er my soul. What dreadful madness fires thee, O my Raymond? EEMOINE. Unseen, just now I mark'd his fierce demeanour; 'Tis madness tears him: A wild mutiny Tempests his bosom; now in dreadful pause His thoughts seem lost; then springing suddenly He stamps the ground; then jealously casts round His burning eyes, as if he fear'd his thoughts Were listen'd to; then snatches at his sword, And mutters vengeance for his wounded honour. ERMINIA. I am the victim, and will meet his rageâ My evil dÃ¦mon sent him in the moment, The only hapless moment of my life That ever wish'd, or could have thank'd the care Of explicationâOh just Heav'n, fulfil The last poor hope that to my heart remains! Give me some moments speech, while cold death trembles On my pale lips. Enter the King. KING. Why thus, oh gentlest Lady, Why thus in love with deepest wretchedness? Bold is the pride, and lofty the ambition, Of Raymond's soul: these shall be satisfied; Let but a few short days restore his reason. ERMINIA. Your goodness flies before my boldest wish, Accept my gratitude; 'tis allâ KING. How blest were I Could every wish this bosom heaves for you Succeed so well, you should be more than happy. Ah, need I tellâHave not my eyes ere now Told you I love. ERMINIA. Good heaven, what did I hear! Forbear, repeat it not. [Erminia retiring. KING. Forbear to love you! Impossibleâand have I thenâalas! ERMINIA. Oh gentle Peace, where shall I fly to find thee! Yet let me fly from danger; where, Eemoine, Where hast thou fled? KING. Yet hear, my lovely charmer. Oh heaven restrain my ardour of affection! Boundless it rises, boundless as the charms Of its dear goddessâHave you now forgot You talk'd of gratitude? then view me, Lady, As your protector. Ah, what transport this! [Embracing her. ERMINIA. Ha, hence, presume not. Anguish so distracts me, I heard not what you said. Where, are my attendants? Have I said ought? if ought to give you hope? Oh Heaven I knew it not. KING. Never, O thou fairest, Did beauty's sweet enchantment thus possess me: I am all eye to dwell on these thy charms, All heart to feel their power. ERMINIA. Oh Raymond, Raymond! Ev'n my soul weeps to think how I ungenerous Have wrong'd thy fond affection's pious care. Ah now I see, and bitterly I mourn, The secret cause thy gentle delicacy Would ne'er reveal, why thou detainest me here Far from the courtly walks of Fountainbleau, Too well thou knewestâOh, whither are ye fled, Ye pitying Angels! KING. Angels of love surround you. Ah kill me not with these forbidding frowns. Yes, I'll presume to name a monarch's grandeur, And offer all my kingdom's lofty pomp. ERMINIA. Forbear, nor dare to offer the pollution Ev'n of your touch again. Unfavouring Heaven, I deem'd, had given me more than female weakness. Now I behold what arts are try'd to tear me From my poor Raymond's dear affectionânow, Now I'm a Roman, and demand you give me My injur'd husband. O'er his dreadful mien Soon shall my tale restore the smiles of joy. KING. Confusion, ruin to my hopesâAh, Madam, For daring actions but some moments old, To you unknown, the state demands his blood: And ponder this, I, I alone can save him. ERMINIA. Your impious passion asks the blood of Raymond; But France demands his gallant sword to save her. Your wish now known, no more I am a supplian By that which dearer than his life he holds. My wedded faith, his life shall ne'er be purchas'd. If stript of these his fair domains, and banish'd His native land, his virtue still will give him Sweeter repose than ever tyrant knew; But if his blood must stain the guilty scaffold, Eternal infamy shall blot the memory Of generous Francis, and the latest ages Shall view the shining virtues which emblaze His boasted name as but the rays of tinsel. In generous glow of mind, which cost him nothing, He was a heroe; but when selfish passion Whisper'd its tyrant claim, the basest slave Ne'er sacrificed his neighbour's happiness With more stone-hearted colder cruelty. Such will the heart that warms in honour's cause In latest times pronounce thee. KING. Gentle Lady, Though thus you wound my honour, by my sceptre, My kingdom's welfare touches not my heart With such an earnest zealous care as yours. O give me then the power, and thou and Raymond Shall yet be happy. ERMINIA. Firmly I demand The duteous justice which the Heaven's dread sovereign Exacts from proudest kings. Dark fraud, and art Of soulest stain, alone have fix'd on Raymond, What lightest colour of offence he bears. KING. My Honour to thy arms shall give thy Raymond. O yet believe thy happiness inspires My dearest wishâ [Exit. ERMINIA. O Raymond, how my heart Bleeds o'er thy wrongs!âBut Heaven now gives me courage, And I will vindicate thy injur'd honour. [Exit</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENEâAn Apartment in the Castle. ERMINIA. Thy tidings, O Eemoine! chill my breast As death's cold touch. O rash impatient Raymond, Why hast thou fled thy castle? One short hour Had made us ever happyâAh, how couldst thou Unkindly leave me in the robber's power? Alas, my heartâ EEMOINE. The purpos'd robbery, Madam, Shall now defeat itself. Indeed the Sovereign Rages with blindest passion, and will seize His hapless prey, perhaps, if art prevent not. Our art shall do it; from the chace we'll fly To Bourbon's host, and find the injur'd Raymond. O happy shall I be to lend my aid To blight the fraudful purpose, which till now Conceal'd its horrid front. ERMINIA. And art thou true? EEMOINE. Amazement, Lady! All, all my heart feels is the wish to serve you. Oh, Madam, forfeit not your happiness By doubting my attachment! ERMINIA. Though Raymond love me not, yet all my soul Weeps o'er the thought that Raymond loves me not. My heart still loves him with a painful anguish. Oh Raymond, Raymond, didst thou feel as I do, This, this would melt thee. EEMOINE. To the chace, Erminia, And sieze the golden moments 'ere the hand Of envious time debase them. ERMINIA. This perhaps May save my honour, and appease my Raymond, [Snatching up a dagger and concealing it in her dress. Some ghostly being, by the mortal eye Unseen, and by human nerves unfelt, Lays its cold hand upon my inmost soul, And chills me with an horror mixt with boldness. EEMOINE. And let the spirit of your sires inspire you. Be bold, and trust in Heavenâ ERMINIA. Thrice happy he On whom kind Heaven bestows a faithful friend! Tho' danger leagued with darkness hover over him. And every step seem on a gulph's dread edge, Yet on his friend's kind arm he safely leans, And safely passes through the beating storm. Thus, leaning on thy friendship, to the chace I go Eemoine. EEMOINE. And gay happiness Shall close the evening of this doubtful morn. [Exeunt together. SCENEâA Cave in a Wood. Bramville and Raymond in Peasants Cloaks. BRAMVILLE. This cave, my Lord, will give us friendly shelter, While to th' embattled field the purple morn Calls forth each army. RAYMOND. Hail, ye solemn shades, Ye gloomy haunts! I feel your genius soothe me, Here my last sigh shall heave; my sudden absence So Ronsard warn'd me, has alarm'd the tyrant. This Peasant's cloak may shroud me from his rage One wretched hour, while yet his cruel scorn Might pierce my heart. I charge thee, leave me Bramville. BRAMVILLE. Alas, my Lord, here will we stay till night Provide us safety: friendly silence here Will best indulge, perhaps will soothe your woes. RAYMOND. Will soothe my woes! vain hope: Erminia's name, Like a damn'd spell, calls up the dreary fiends Of horror and despair in arms against me. O wounding sight!âlo, floating thro the dusk, My household smoke curls o'er the waving trees And does, Oh horrid, does another lover Riot in unhallow'd dalliance by my hearth, While I am driven from my paradise To wander here. O false, ungenerous woman! Enter Ronsard, RONSARD. Tremendous justice, look from heav'n, and bare Thy red right-arm!âO best, O bravest peer, Are these thy fitting honours! RAYMOND. Never more Shall I again put on the state of greatness. Wrap me, ye dismal shades, from yonder sun That rises hateful on meâ Heard you that groan? 'twas the wind sadly rustling Thro' the dark shade of yonder dreary pinesâ There shall I restâThe busy bustling world Seems a base crowd to me, scrambling at toys With such blind rage, that o'er their brothers necks They tread to catch them. Never shall I more Mix in that impious crowd. Leave me, my friends. RONSARD. I owe my life to thy undaunted valour. My life is thine, brave Count, my life shall serve thee. RAYMOND. What canst thou hope with me! and canst thou bear To view the hideous aspect of misfortune? The heart is chill'd and feels a dis-esteem Rising at its approach. A friend at first may feel; for kindly nature Will give one pang: but soon he learns to view His friend thro' the dim shade his fate casts o'er him, A shade that spreads its evening darkness o'er His brightest virtues, while it shews his foibles Crowding and obvious as the midnight stars, Which in the sunshine of prosperity Never had been descried. RONSARD. So your false friends, the sun-flowers of your fortune, Will now shrink from you; but may Heaven's dread bolt Blast this right-arm when it deserts your cause! Respect your name, your peace, let vengeance rouse you. BRAMVILLE. Yet, let to-morrow's thoughts mature each hope. RONSARD. This instant is the time. Your manly rage, When you renounc'd allegiance to the tyrant, The tyrant knows and holds as daring treason. A price is on your head: then rouse my Lord; The King has urg'd your Countess by the dawn Thro' these wild forest walks, and bordering heath, To rouse the slumbering deer. Then let full vengeanceâ BRAMVILLE. Fond youth, beware: vain were the dread attempt, And but a prelude to the dreadful scaffold; Let other meansâ RAYMOND. To give my rage the rein, And pour my vengeance on the Sovereign's head, Were but to give the victory to Bourbon. See, O my country, what a sacrifice I give to thee, my injuries for thee Rest unatoned. BRAMVILLE. Thus time will bring calm peace, And virtue triumph o'er the pangs of woe As o'er the griefs of childhood. Happiness Is a coy plant, my Lord; 'tis not a native Of this cold world; the delicate fair stranger Demands all sunshine, and a constant tendance; And oft when the gay bloom gives boastful promise Of golden fruit, of ever during fruit, The lovely plant low drops the blasted head. Yet there's a joy that blooms amid the storm. Of fortune's coldest winter; a calm joy That stays behind, when ev'n the last tir'd friend, The lingering brother, from the sick man's head Withdraws his weary arm. RAYMOND. Tell the pale gasping asthma to breathe free, And tell the burning fever to allay Its frantic rage, but tell not woes like mine To have no feelingâErminia has begg'd To be protected from me; not one thought Sprung in this breast but melted with affection; Every idea serv'd her; still my fancy Rov'd on her gracesâher bewitching smiles My heart's sole sunshine; yet I hear'd her beg To be protected from me. Hell's worst poison Burns in the wound given by a dear lov'd friend, By such a friendâOh burst, ye flashing lightnings, Burst round my head and wrap meâ RONSARD. Let your trampled honour Fire you, my Lord; let no soft tear unman you. Respect your name, brave Count, and injur'd honour, And form some resolution to defend them. RAYMOND. How, how! O tell me: he that soothes my soul In death, will do but secondary kindness. RONSARD. Leave vain complaint; Bourbon has turn'd his march, A few hours more will see him rouse the King From his adulterous revels. Gallant Bourbon Is still your friend; then join his prosp'rous cause. RAYMOND. Now am I low indeed, when thou, fond boy, Thus dar'st insult me. RONSARD. Would to Heaven your eyes, That now lower on me, saw what cruel pain Your fate gives here!âOh Heaven, and must your blood Spout o'er the scaffold, while the racking wheel And burning torture, ev'n in these bold eyes, Shall bring the sullen drop, that spight of courage Will rise, prevent my Lordâ RAYMOND. The view of this Has breath'd a steady calmness thro' my soul, And passion speaks not this; indeed, O Ronsard, I fear the rack, my soul shrinks back from torment, And I will fly it: but it is the torment, The dreadful rack of my own mind's upbraiding, 'Tis that alone I fear, alone will fly. Bourbon has rais'd his foot to trample on My prostrate country; and shall my deep wrongs Cry vengeance in his camp, and nerve his arm To parricide! No; let the silent grave Bury my wrongs 'ere thus they be reveng'd Upon my countryâNeverâknow, fond youth, I am no Atticus to smile on him Who stabs my country. BRAMVILLE. O my Lord, while thus Unknowing, what unhappy course to take We linger here unfix'd and unresolved The tyrants bands.â RAYMOND. I am resolv'dâAlive, His bands shall never take me; never shall I Be brought in chains before the exulting Tyrant, To see my Traitress fondly smile on him, And scowl disdain on me. No, death shall save From that worst hell. Down, down, imagination, Hence with the horrid scene: down, busy thought, O Bramville, give my limbs a decent grave. BRAMVILLE. Mercy, kind Heav'nâIs Raymond's noble soul Vanquish'd at last and fallen! Oh had Marseilles Beheld you in ignoble flight, desert Her firmest ramparts 'ere my eyes had seen you Desert your mind's firm valour! RAYMOND. Talk of valour To him who fears: I fear not. All I valued, My heart's sole joy is now for ever iost: Not Heaven can spotless to my arms restore The lost Erminia: my soul is now Familiar with horror, and would wooe Its dreadful shadesâif oft at times o'erwhelm'd Beneath its woes an unprogressive vacancy Absorb my faculties, 'tis but more livingly To feel my first, my constant recollection, Erminia's faleshood. In each nerve, each thought, My heart is wounded: to restrain its rage, Its lust of grief, were torment: let its rage Then swell, 'till weary nature sink oppress'd Beneath its burden, then may sullen peace Come with her awful gloom, while from my breast The life blood failsâ Ha, death, distraction! must the Tyrant's triumphs Pursue me here! heardst thou the huntsman's horn? RONSARD. This way they drive: the sound draws near. RAYMOND. Is lust so soon, Crawl'd out of bed! fie on't, fie on't, my heart Is sick of this base world! Erminia Be false, and yet endure the light! Erminia Be false, and cheerful too! O haste, my friends, And mark their rout: 'twere well I knewâ BRAMVILLE. Alas! I fear you mean to leave this thickest shade, And rush on danger. RAYMOND. Here I'll wait, believe me: I'll never leave this thicket to be plung'd In deeper miseriesâ [Ex. Bram. and Ronsard. âWhat an awful silence Surrounds me now! thus life's poor noisy bustle Goes off at last. Soft gliding thro' my breast I feel a peaceful foretaste of the rest That soon will come. Perhaps to these lone shades Some noble Patriot, fled from CÃ¦sar's sword, Here wept his country's woes, then sunk to rest Like a tir'd babe, while death's cold heavy slumbers Crept on his yielding heart. Perhaps yon stone, That grey with moss just peers above the weeds, Points to his bones that fifteen hundred years Have slept in peace. O death, thou silent Angel, Soon be my rest like his. Then come, my sword; My wrongs shall thunder in my ears no moreâ Yet anxious nature asks, while holy silence Wraps the cold ashes, and calm peace invites Ev'n the wild deer to harbour at his tomb, Is all as peaceful with the conscious mind? Ah, what a depth of uncreated night Hangs here! yet reason through the awful gloom Shoots her pale beams, and casts a feeble ray On virtues triumph, on a shore beyond The darksome grave. Dies that pure spirit, thought, Which shares the nature of th' eternal mind! Sleeps that in dust! are guilts convulsive pangs That oft in death begin to wake their horrors, All hush'd in death! Who can demonstrate this? Ah, this wrings confession ev'n from obstinacy, That death which brings foul guilt along with it, May bring no rest. Who flies from life confesses He flies from something that appears so dreadful, He dares not face it. Is it guilt or virtue That thus shrinks back and trembles at to-morrow? Yes, this is meanness, and alone regards Its selfish ease; virtue is never leagued With its base dictates. Is it then such meanness To fly that point where pain and anguish shower Their burning arrows! Oh distraction, where, Where am I lost, each feeling longs for death, But death invited by a coward's guilt. Oh hellâto live, perhaps to die to-morrow On an assassin's knifeâ Ha, what ungracious foot Disturbs these shades! O fury, vengeance fire me, My murderer! Enter the King armed with a Boar spear. âIndignant Heaven, proud Tyrant, Has sent thee here to pour its vengeance on thee. Thou com'st to rouse the boar in this lone thicket; But thou hast found a wounded Lion here. Now shall my swordâ KING. Off sacrilegious Peasant, And dread thy fate for daring to approach My sacred person. RAYMOND. Oh indignity! Is black unmanly lurking cruelty, Is dark adultery sacred! But my sword Shall do me right. KING. Thee right! base slave, thy King did never wrong thee. RAYMOND. And know'st thou not the deeply injur'd Raymond! KING. Oh mercy, Heav'n! RAYMOND. Does thy deep guilt unman thee? The wrongs which thou hast basely heap'd upon me, To me unking thee. Thou art now to me But Duke of Valois, I a Peer thine equal, In all but guilt thy equal; there thou art As the vile worm, below meâHa, where now The eye that scowl'd like Jove's!âbut guard thy heart. Tho' thou hast stabb'd my heart when it was guardless, And glowing in thy service, yet I feel I cannot be so base as do thee justice; My wrongs demand, while thou stand'st like a sacrifice Yielding and trembling. KING. Thy wrongs shall have full justice. RAYMOND. Yes, by Heaven, This sword shall have it. Thy power, thy titles, all thy pageant tinsel, The indignant hand of reason shuffles by. And shews, in the true colours of thy mind, Thy naked selfâAh, blushing honour turns From that poor sightâGood heav'n, and is my sword Now pointed at the man it lately guarded! I cannot view myself but every part Wakes the remembrance of my loyalty. This breast, this faithful breast, where thou hast planted The thorns of hell, is furrow'd with the wounds Receiv'd for thee. Away, this milkiness; My wrongs, my wrongs, cry vengeance! KING. Strike it home then. [dropping his spear. RAYMOND. What, I attack thee guardless! I attack thee Like an assassin!âNoâProstrate, yet awful, My country meets my view. Alas, vain man, Thou thinks that Bourbon's fledâThe cruel sword Of Bourbon hangs like Heaven's own vengeance o'er thee; Hangs o'er the land that gave my father birth. And I, no more her soldier, must stand by, Like palsied age, and see my country bleed. Yet Tyrant as thou art, yet thou her King, May'st save my country: live then, haughty plunderer! And be thy own stung heart my wrongs revenger. My wrongsâValois, I fly thee 'ere my wrongs Burst into raging madnessâ [Ex. Raymond. KING. How dreadful is the frown of injured merit! Not Heaven's red light'ning volley'd at my head Could thus have aw'd me. Death! and did I tremble Before the daring Traytor! Ample vengeance Shall yet atoneâHis crime against my royalty Shall now give full possession to my love. Enter Guise hastily. Why thus alarm'd! Where, where the beauteous prize I charg'd you here to bring, that here my vows Of faithful care might lend a healing balm 'Ere she was borne to Fountainbleauâ GUISE. My Liege, Your crownâyour lifeâthe haughty rebel Bourbon Has meant no flight. From the surrounding woods He pours his legions, like a sudden flood Bursting upon us. KING. Tenfold vengeance strike him! And must this sacred hour be stain'd and blighted By his dire treason? But my tenfold fury Shall thunder on his crest. Enter Lord Admiral hastily with Attendants. LORD ADMIRAL. O to the camp, my Liege, Our troops are all in tumult and dismay, And on the step to fly. Each common soldier Reminds his fellow of old prophecies, And wizard-rhymes, which say, the House of Bourbon Shall wear the crown of France. KING. Bring me my steed, [to the Attendants. And bid our trumpets sound to arms, to battle. LORD ADMIRAL. 'Tis echoed thro' the camp, that gallant Raymond Now fights for Bourbon: Consternation trembles On every knee; speechless they eye each other. But your bold fire, my Liege, will chase the paleness From their cold cheeks. KING. And has the name of Raymond So dread a charm? Speed to the camp of dastards, Lord Admiral, and let the coldest know, The shadow has not mov'd upon the dial Since Raymond's sword was brandish'd at their sovereign, And dar'd his breast. Away, and on the instant Ourself shall lead the battleâ [Ex Ld. Adm. âWhere, my Guise, My heart's best treasure, where the dearest fair one? GUISE. Safe in the deepest thicket of the wood, My Spouse, in trust of my return, delays her. KING. Oh Heaven, her charms are irresistible! And Heaven gave me the power to make them mine, And by Heaven's charter I will riot in them! Behold these lofty towers, these lordly forests, And these wide lawns, my Guiseâthese shall reward thee. [pointing to the Castle, &amp;c. Raymond lurks nearâand be it thine to seize him; But hide the deed from the bewitching fair one. Her, swift to Fountainbleau, how e'er reluctant, With smoothest art and kindest mien convey. The royal promise grants thee these domains; These bands obey thy nod. GUISE. These deeds, my Liege, Fierce Raymond seiz'd, and fair Erminia thine, Shall crown the triumph of thy victory. Exeunt. SCENEâThe Wood. Raymond and Bramville. BRAMVILLE. The chace, my Lord, now sounds among the hills, That bound the forest on the western edge: But other toils will soon demand the field: The van of Bourbon's host draws on to battle. The camp is all in tumult, and the King Prepares to meet him. RAYMOND. Now, now, my heart: Oh how it pants for something That might relieve it. That poor wild fire, Reason, Mocks me; it glimmers now on this side, now Flits to the other, ever vanishing As I approach it! What an awful gloom Surrounds me! not a choice left to my action, Not one my heart approves. Dreadful condition, Where every principle that stirs within me Burns to act nobly, yet some act of meanness, Turn where I will, of madness or of meanness, Obtrudes upon me! A stern Judge that never Will pardon me; myself, bids me bewareâ RONSARD. Away these doubts: when Prudence weighs an action Her cold blood slumbers o'er it 'till the time Of action flies. Your awful sword was brandish'd At the King's breast. I saw him join his bands. I heard your fate pronounc'd. This is the moment To shun the dreadful scaffold. Let the rage Of injur'd honour guide you: mark the Tyrant, And meet him in the flight with sword to sword, And leave the event to Heaven. RAYMOND. It was my country, 'Twas her great cause disarm'd me, when my sword Was pointed at the trembling heart! then what Alone remains I'll do. Leave me, my friends; I am mark'd out for vengeance: would you give New tortures to my woes by falling with me? RONSARD. Thy blood must soon secure the Tyrant's rapine, UnlessâAh me, and shall I leave thee now! No; by thy wrongs I will notâGive the rein To manly indignation, and atone Thy wounded honour: let thy wrongs have vengeance. Heavens, were thy wrongs but mine!âYes; they are mine, They are my friend's. The moment flies, my Lord. BRAMVILLE. O my fallen country! Raymond's gallant arm Guards thee no more: upon the King's own valour Rests all thy hope: And shall my Raymond's wrongs In these most sacred moments cry for vengeance, And blunt the sword that guards his native land? Should the King fallâ RAYMOND. The King!âMy vengeance rouses, My sword plung'd in his heart were not to wrong him. BRAMVILLE. But it would stab your country. RAYMOND. Gracious Heaven! This, this at last must heal my woesâ [drawing his sword. RONSARD. What! die! And leave th' Adulterer in triumphant riot In your love bed, drunk with Erminia's charm's? RAYMOND. Speak it no moreâOh 'tis a glympse of heaven Shewn to the damn'd. RONSARD. Then o'er the Tyrant's heaven Pour hell's black shades. But speak the word, my Lord. Then let her die. RAYMOND. O God! the dreadful issue My thoughts avoidedâLet her dieâO Tyrant, What horrid ruin hast thou brought on me! Yes; let her dieâ RONSARD. Now at the chace we'll-find her. Hark! 'tis the horn: the chace draws near. Amidst His triumph, heavy shall our vengeance fall. RAYMOND. Then shall my trampled honour yet erase My name's disgrace, and tear hot breath'd pollution From its rank soil; then shall the exulting Tyrant, Amid the triumph of his pride, behold His lustful bed chang'd for her ghastly shroud. Horror now has steel'd me: Yes, I could smile, then drop the yearning tear; To see Erminia breathless at my feet. But to behold her in th' Adulterer's bed, To see her but in fancy thereâO Hell, It strikes with madness! RONSARD. We'll tear her thence, my Lord. RAYMOND. My hand shall strike the blow: No other sword Shall touch her faithless breast. I cannot leave That dreadful office to another's rage. Yes; I shall drop the tear in luxury Of raging grief, and kiss the hands that mangle Her faithless bosom. O my friends, how lovely, How flush'd with ev'ry graceful seeming virtue, Shone my Erminia! and shall this handâ Oh burning anguish still the dear idea Obtrudes upon me, when each happy moment Led on another happier, till at last Came one curst hour, and darken'd all the rest, And lost the world to me. BRAMVILLE. Hear'd you that echo? It is the huntsman's voice: the chace turns hither. RONSARD. Then stand to arms. RAYMOND. And thus an happy death May close my woes. But should I fall, my wish. Unsatisfied, by all your dearest hopes, Oh soothe my ghost, and blast the Tyrant's revels! RONSARD. I swear, my Lord, my sword waits the fair time. [Ex. Ronsard. BRAMVILLE. And mine, my Lord. RAYMOND. Oh my friends indulge me! I have been rudely waken'd from a dream Of more than human bliss and extacy, To all the horrors of the madman's cell. Heaven try'd on me what bliss a man could know, But gave the keeping of it to a Woman; And that false-hearted woman has betray'd it, To one who boasts of faithlessness to woman; To one who holds the character of woman Worthless and vain; despising what he conquers. O I could weep for that unhappy man Whose heart's sole treasure is embark'd in Woman; Just when he thinks his halcyon days are come, When on the smooth calm tide of life, his joys Securely glide, poor man, what storms rush in, What dreadful ruin! And oh cruel wound, He feels that flaunting baseness, thinly gilded With gallantry, gay trifling, oaths and flattery Have had more graceful charms than all his merit. Alas, this is but weeping for myself! What now, brave youth?â Ronsard re-enters hastily. RONSARD. The moment sacred to thy injur'd honour Is now on wing,âThe royal camp Is all in tumult: thither the King has sped; The ladies with the huntsmen chase the deer On yon nigh dale: 'ere now by the forests edge May we surprise them, and atchieve our purpose, RAYMOND. My spirit rises as the dreadful hour; Rises in horror! RONSARD. Righteous heaven, my Lord, Itself is party in our just attempt, And on my sword, I swearâ BRAMVILLE. And on my sword, I swear, All that an old man's wither'd arm can do, This arm shall do!âI will not boast, my Lord; Yet still there's warm blood here that shall flow freely. RAYMOND. From yonder dark brow'd glade the prospect opens In wide extent. Thither with speed, my friends. RONSARD. And mark the Lady in the silk of white, Arm'd like the sylvan Goddess of the chace, With bow and quiverâ RAYMOND. Hah! the false Erminiaâ RONSARD. Erminia's graceful port, and noble mien Seem'd to adorn her; but the distance veil'd Her smiles accurs'dâ RAYMOND. Horror now strengthens me. Eternal justice, be my sword thy minister, To pour thy vengeance on triumphing guilt! Yes; Heaven's own vengeance points my thirsty sword. Hither with speed, my friends! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENEâA Thicket in a Wood near the mouth of a Cave. Raymond and Bramville, RAYMOND. Here Ronsard was to meet usâWhat a horror Coldly glides through me! like a lurking felon Must I approach my castle, while the robbers Revel withinâOh parent Heaven, how awful What now I feel! That solemn pleasing dread Unspeakable! the grave's chill invitation Sent to the good man's heart when verging on it. That unnam'd touch, which man, ordain'd to live, Did never feel, now thrills me: and inspiring A drear affection for the darksome gulph, Whose shore was never seen by human eye, Shews smiling peace prepar'd to waft me through. BRAMVILLE. When Grief's hot fever has burn'd out its rage Comes Melancholy, and with gentle hand Throws a soft slumber o'er the wearied passions; And then, while Reason sleeps, bending the vigour Of manly action down, thro' mournful shades Of listless pleasing woe, she impious leads The dreamful fancy.âThus, my Lord, she leads you; The touch you feel is Melancholy's soothing: But rouse your nobler temper to the deeds Your honour and your wrongs impose upon you. RAYMOND. Yes, I will rouse meâHark! the sounds of tumult Struggle on the forest's edgeâ BRAMVILLE. Bourbon, I deem, Disturbs the Tyrant's revels; and on speed Comes Ronsardâ Enter Ronsard. RONSARD. Deeper to the Cave, my Lord, Let us retireâ RAYMOND. Say, where my joyful Traitress? RONSARD. Just when I mark'd her party, and the route, The hounds pursued, the shout of Bourbon's army Echo'd along the dales, and his bold van Gave their first thunder. Instant o'er the downs, Raging as burning Hercules, the King Led forth his trembling Host. In wild dismay The hunters fled, some to the Castle, some Plung'd into the woodâ RAYMOND. Oh Heaven, and is my vengeance, And thy dread justice, yet again delay'd! RONSARD. Erminia's party to the Castle sped: There may we seize her. Let one little hour But half expire, then will the battle rage In its full strength; then may our purpose fear Wayward delay no moreâ BRAMVILLE. Hah, 'tis the sound Of horsemen rushing through the neighbouring glades; Retire, my Lord; a price is on your blood. 'Ere to full meeting flame the battle rise, I'll arm your faithful servants to assist Our honour's causeâ RAYMOND. Oh speed theeâ [Ex. Bramville. âHere to lurk; Here watch the time, to poignard that fair bosom Where yesterday my soul was all enshrined! Dreadful necessity! O living horror! Good Heaven, couldst thou restore me yesterday! [Ex. Raym. and Rons. into the Cave. SCENEâA Lawn on the Edge of a Forest. An Encampment at a distance. Enter the King, followed by the Lord Admiral, and other Attendants. KING. Distraction, fury! blinded by my passion, I have disgraced the warlike name, have suffer'd The rebel to surprise me. Oh dishonour! Yet shall both traitors mourn; the traitor Raymond, So fame reports, commands proud Bourbon's right, And drives our mercenary troops before him, Who tremble at his nameâ GUISE. To seize his castle, Doubt not he deems, and bear away the Countessâ KING. The goddess of my heart! Heavens, if I yield her, May Bourbon triumph!âLord Admiral, thy battalion Shall reinforce my Guise to guard the fair one, For whom my crown now trembles on my head. GUISE. Be confident; our zeal shall be successful. LORD ADMIRAL. Oh to the field, my Liegeâ KING. Yes; there the astonish'd dastards Require my rage to fire themâ Oh Raymond, had I now a General As brave, as honest!âHeavens, am I thus reduced? No; this is mineâ [drawing his sword. âto this I'll trust my kingdoms. GUISE. And wonted victory attend that sword! [Ex. King. LORD ADMIRAL. Now, now, my Lord, our power expires or triumphs; Our hope's sole anchor is not yet secur'd: The wayward Fair One means to fly the King: Haste, search these wild wood thickets, and secure her; The Castle be my care. GUISE. To search the forest Were now to lose her: every moment seems A long slow hour till my Eemoine's page Tell where she hides or fliesâO frowning Heaven! And shall the stern-brow'd Raymond yet again Enter these walls in triumph, and exact His great revenge! LORD ADMIRAL. No; he shall gnaw the dust Beneath the meanest spear of my Battalion 'Ere there he triumph. Instant, O my Lord! Plant round these wild wood glades thy trustiest bands And give her wish'd escape its doom'd defiance. [Exeunt severally. SCENEâA deep gloomy Thicket. Erminia, Eemoine, a Page and other Attendants. ERMINIA. You told me, Bramville was to meet me here: Alas, he comes not!âOf my innocence, You said, you told him, how with tears of joy He heard the tale. Alas! his faithful steps Never, till now, thus linger'dâ EEMOINE. Patience, Lady, Is Heaven's own balmâ ERMINIA. Oh fly, ye gloomy hours! what boding darkness Rests on these momentsâ EEMOINE. 'Tis the busy working Of Fear's keen lively sense that leads your thoughts Through waking dreams, where jealous terror shifts The dim illusive scenery. ERMINIA. Fear and terror Become my lorn condition wellâEre yet The matin bell has toll'd its holy summons, The impious Tyrant may perhaps for ever Divorce the noble Raymond from my arms. Oh Heaven protect him from my loath'd betrayers! Oh give me back my Husbandâ EEMOINE. Utmost prudence, Lady, Becomes us now: Bramville will soon relieve Thy load of woes. Again I'll urge his coming. [She dismisses the Page. O yield not thus to unavailing passion! Alas, a fever of the sickly mind O'erpowers thee, Lady! hear thy weeping friend, Yield me the poignard. ERMINIA. Yield my Honor's safeguard! No; by my wrongsâ EEMOINE. Oh Heaven, bethink thee, Lady, What vain repentance may for ever weep O'er one rash moment. ERMINIA. Yes; no vain repentance Shall weep my honour's stain; with impious rage The Tyrant burns; but this, perhaps, shall change The fatal object that impassions him Into a form of horror; or perhaps, So guide me Heaven,âshall reek in his hot breast. This, this were worthy gallant Raymond's spouse, And not a coward's flightâ A coward's flight, thro' self-given death, but ill Becomes the mind that feels its dignity In vigorous health, and smiles upon itself. And mine with joy reviews each wish, each thought, That ere lived hereâ [Concealing a dagger. EEMOINE. While Bramville tarries, Lady, Yon shepherd's bower, where o'er the verdant bank The roses and the woodbine emulate The pinks and cowslips of the floor below; Yon bower invites us to its safe retreat. ERMINIA. Oh Bramville, Bramville, speed thee!âthis delay [they retire. Ill suits that generous friendly warmth which marks Thy hoary ageâ [the scene closes. SCENEâA Glade in a Wood. Enter Raymond, Bramville, and armed Peasants. BRAMVILLE. Your faithful servants offer Their lives, my Lord, to give your wish success. This is the moment: On the field the King Now greets the foe with dreadful salutation. RAYMOND. Then on my friendsâGood heaven, why shake my knees With sudden faltering! Why this chilly tremor! That never seiz'd me in the eve of battle! Oh judge not you, who never felt my passion; Ye leaden-hearted Herd, whose cold base temper Takes no impression but of sordid stamp, Judge not my feelingsâOh Erminia! Go I to murder thee!âOh horror! horror! Yet Heaven's own justice fires me. Enter Ronsard in haste. RONSARD. Not, my Lord. Not to the CastleâIn a flowery arbour, By yonder glade, the sylvan Goddess rests Her wearied limbsâ RAYMOND. Waiting her paramour When crown'd with victory. Eternal justice! This, this is thy tremendous hourâ âOn, on my friends! Dark are the paths of Fate; but, led by honour, Firm is our footing, and our peace secure. RONSARD. Now, now, my Lord, that life you bravely sav'd When I was down in battle, when you rush'd Between me and the lifted pole-ax, now That life shall serve youâ [Exeunt. SCENEâWoodland Glades. Enter Raymond and Bramville. RAYMOND. Here wide the prospect opens. Ronsard watches The other gladeâHere rests my TraitressâLeave me To this dread sceneâ BRAMVILLE. Gladly, I turn, my Lord, From such sad viewâO gracious Heaven prevent What e'er offends theeâ [Ex. Bramville. RAYMOND. Ah, whence this sudden gloom which shoots athwart The conscious forest! As if wailing ghosts Were gliding thro' the trembling leaves, the sigh Glides sullen on. 'Tis Nature's conscious horror When the stern robber holds his impious feast, Bought with the wretchedness of innocence. Oh cruel Francis, what unfeeling heart Rages in thy dark bosom! Oh inhuman, Hast thou no pang that whispers what I feel! Canst thou sit down and grossly feast thy appetite, Whilst the just Master of the plunder'd banquet Stabb'd by thy knife, lay bleeding in thy sight! Oh heaven, I could not do itâbut thou stern Tyrantâ [He turns and sees Erminia at some distance. Ha, now horror steels me. [Ex. and immediately re-enters. Another Woodland scene.

Saw'st thou stray thro' these shadesâ RAYMOND. Saw'st thou! saw whom! The King! And dar'st thou ask thy injur'd Husband. [throwing his Peasant's cloak aside, Eemoine retires, Raymond brandishes his sword. ERMINIA. Oh save me Heaven, my Lordâ [going to embrace him. RAYMOND. Cruel apostateâ Away these Woman's artsâThou, thou has damn'd My frantic soul. ERMINIA. Oh yet, my Lord, yet hear me. RAYMOND. And darest thou think I'll leave thee in the bed Of rank pollutionâPour your tears to heaven! Let one short prayerâAnd horror brace my arm. ERMINIA. Oh, what thou wiltâYet spare me till my tongue Save thee from deepest woes, my injur'd Raymond. RAYMOND. Spare thee! for whom! for the Adulterer's arms! No; by my wrongsâThis for thy faithless heart. [She faints. Hah, do I grasp my Traitress! rousing vengeance May now attoneâYet let me one dread moment Contemplate that fair face, where once all Heaven Open'd its smiles upon meâAh, how woeful! What energy of deepest penitence [drops his sword. Tells its severe distress in these pale features! Yes; these are Virtue's looks, when generous Virtue Bares her repenting bosom to the darts Of terrible remorseâ How pure the innocence that once was thine! That was, but is not nowâAnd art thou now My horror, freezing my blood at touch of thee. O gracious powers, what anguish trembles there On these pale lips of death! Yes; every feature Speaks Innocence betray'dâSure Angels wept When thouâOh fallen! Oh lost Erminiaâ Yet wake and tell meâ [recovering. ERMINIA. Canst thou weep for me! Oh generous Raymond, how was I betray'd! Yet, oh forgive my ashes when the dustâ Yet, while I live, oh take, for pity snatch me Far from my loath'd Betrayer's hateful arms RAYMOND. From thy loath'd Betrayer! ERMINIA. Yes; O witness Heaven! I was betray'd to view thee as resolved On my destruction, and that all your love Was turn'd to raging hatred. RAYMOND. And, oh horror! O'erwhelm thy speech, in Woman's blind revenge Gave allâBut turn your eyes to Heavenâ [he lifts and brandishes his sword. ERMINIA. Yet hear, My Lord, my husband hear me; death will then, If thou canst give it, death will then be all My heart can wishâ RAYMOND. Heaven's can I hopeâO speakâ ERMINIA. Oh couldst thou yet Forgive, and love me. RAYMOND. Haste, speak, tho' thy words Strike me with death. ERMINIA. 'Twas on his promise safely to restore, And reconcile me to you, I accompanied The chace this morning. RAYMOND. Was the Villain's purpose Then unaccomplish'd? Speakâ ERMINIA. I was deceiv'dâ RAYMOND. Oh Heavenâ ERMINIA. Yet, yet, my Lord, Yet hear: Oh Heaven bear witness how my soul With sudden impulse trembled at the thought When I perceiv'd his purpose. RAYMOND. Can I hope then! Speak, and relieve me. Enter Eemoine. ERMINIA. I hear the tumult Of the King's train. O bear me hence, my Lord, O pity me, and let not violence Complete what all his art in vain essay'd. O much have I to tell what arts they try'd Yet all in vainâWhen I beheld their snares, Stern tho' thy frown, my heart all raging vehemence Burn'd thus to throw me in my Raymond's arms. RAYMOND. And art thou pure indeed!âO boundless rapture! From hell's deep gulph methinks I spring to heaven! Erminia spotless to my arms restored! EEMOINE. Yet fly not hence: As fiercest beasts of prey, The cruel fugitives of either host Pour round the forest edgeâ ERMINIA. O generous Raymond! What rapturous burst of extacy o'erpowers thee To hear my innocence! Yes; all thy rage Was love; an endless theme of love thro' all Our future smiling days. RAYMOND. Ah! what dire horrors Have torn thy gentle breastâBut why this dagger! ERMINIA. I left the chace in trust to fly to thee, And lest the loath'd Betrayer might surprise me This should perhaps have recompenc'd his crimes. Now I resign itâ EEMOINE. To my careâAh madamâ [receives the dagger. RAYMOND. Oh my Erminia! this shall ever make My love a generous debtor, with itself Displeas'd, for never can its zeal repay Thy matchless virtues.

Guise retires, Raymond followed by Ronsard, Bramville and men in arms pursue him and his party. Scene changes. SCENEâEdge of the Wood, clashing of Swords. Raymond enters pursuing Guise. RAYMOND. Now, now I have thee in the grasp of vengeance, Lurking assassin! GUISE. Wilt thou stain thy sword, O generous Raymond, in a heart that pants With its last pangs? What, can thy boasted honour Enjoy the cruel triumph o'er a wretch Whose feeble arm, unstrung by death, can cope With thine no more? RAYMOND. Oh, was it all too little, All thou hast done, but when one gleam of hope To tear my Countess from the Tyrant's arms Shed the last beam of comfort on my soul, That thou must also blot and trample down! O stain of manhood! where are now thy ruffians, Thy lurking murderers? But guard thee, villain. GUISE. Oh Fame, report it, how the mighty soul Of noble Raymond, raging with the lust Of groveling vengeance, gave his sword to mangle The corse already shivering in the arms Of swift approaching death. Oh yes, bold hero, Yes; stain thy honour with the unmanly rage Of giving wound on wound when faint and dying Thy foe resists no more. RAYMOND. I thank thee Caitiff, For warning me. I would not stain my sword To rob thee only of a dying moment. Thy cowardice has purchas'd thee some minutes. Of longer gaspingâO, thou art so bloated With basest guilt, I cannot bear to view thee. My happiness, which never was the fruit Of other's woe, spread wide its blooming honours In a kind soil, when thou, a brutal Plunderer, Hast thrown its fairest blossoms in the dustâ My life blood fails; thy lurking ruffian's swords Have found the mortal part: yet, thanks to Heaven, Thy purpose shall be blighted. GUISE. And art thou wounded? Ye powers of death assist me! [drawing his sword. RAYMOND. Villain! [they fight, Guise falls. There lie, detested coward! Cold in my bosom smarts the murdering sword That kill'd my last fond hope. GUISE. Oh this is terrible! He that receives a wrongâhe, he is happy, Compar'd to him who gave it! My crimes, oh horrible, and death's hand on me! Enter Bramville, Ronsard and Servants, with Eemoine veiled. RONSARD. Still not in vain, my Lord, is our attempt. [to Raymond. We rescued her from Guise's ruffian bands: But let us haste from hence. Ah heaven, you bleed. [Bramville and Ronsard support Raymond. RAYMOND. Death gently beckons me: Oh speed my friends To Sicily, and place my rescued spouseâ [Eemoine drops the veil. Heavens, is it thee! O now my heart is vanquish'd! My last fond wish, my last fond hope destroy'd! [Sinking down, Bramville and Ronsard support him. GUISE. O cursed woman, see the bitter fruits [to Eemoine. Of thy intrigues, and curst adviceâ Some DÃ¦mon drags me hence, dark settling horrorâ [dies. EEMOINE. Dreadful, O dreadful, all my hopes are blasted! [looking at Guise. O injur'd Raymond, trembling I approach thee. Much injur'd Raymond, thy Countess overlov'd thee; 'Twas I attempted to seduce her virtue, Which mid the darkness of these plotful hours Shone with redoubled lustre; loud and awfully Thy wrongs cry vengeance; and behold their victim Kneeling before thee. Mark me, great thy wrongs, And this their fruitsâ [Stabs herself, the dagger snatch'd from her. Yet life seems slow to fly.

Hast thou again betray'd me! if my servants Had not now rescued meâ My evil Angel why thus glar'st thou at me! EEMOINE. The treacherous flow of spirits That gave the blow has left me: deep, oh deep, [sinking down. And deeper still I sink. Oh black'ning horrors, Is there no help?âAlas, no gleam of hope! How dreadful is your silence! Mercy Heaven, Injur'd Erminia, canst thou forgive me? Thy husband lov'd thee, ever fondly lov'd thee. Hence, hence, ye hissing addersâAh it flashes Now, now 'tis darknessâ [dies. ERMINIA. My husband did she say! O yes, he lov'd me. Ha, whatâ [turning to Raymond. My Husband murder'd. [kneeling down by himâA pause. Arise my noble Raymond, rise, And let us flyâ BRAMVILLE. Assume the sacred veil, The holy cloyster's walls shall then protect you, And melancholy peace may shed her balm On life's cold eveningâ ERMINIA.

[Enter the King, guarded by Spanish soldiers. KING. Offâyour base hands, you slavesâ BRAMVILLE.

When gallant injur'd Raymond Sheath'd his good sword, then thou, and France, were conquer'd. BRAMVILLE. Lord Admiral, deep were your state intrigues, Yet mark his truth, the favorite care of Heaven; Tho' fortified with all the brazen mounds That art can rear, and watch'd by eagle's eyes, Still will some rotten part betray the structure That is not bas'd by simple honesty. LORD ADMIRAL. Patience, my Liege, were now becoming grandeur. KING. Insidious villain, in a baser slavery Than this thou long hast held me. Oh Disgrace Left friendless in the field! me, and my cause, So hated, none to back me! Hah! and must I Be led to Bourbon? Must that haughty Traytor, Avengeful Heaven, must he pronounce my fate! O had I died a Monarch in the field! Deeply, O Raymond, deeply art thou reveng'd! Now I'm no King indeedâ Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
