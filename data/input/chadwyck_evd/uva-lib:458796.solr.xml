      <field name="fulltext">THE SCENE ROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Sylla's Ghost. Do'st thou not feele me, Rome? not yet? Is night So heauy on thee, and my weight so light? Can Sylla's Ghost arise within thy walls, Lesse threatning, then an earth-quake, the quick falls Of thee, and thine? shake not the frighted heads Of thy steepe towers? or shrinke to their first beds? Or, as their ruine the large Tyber fills, Make that swell vp, and drowne thy seuen proud hills? What sleepe is this doth seize thee, so like death, And is not it? Wake, feele her, in my breath: Behold, I come, sent from the Stygian sound, As a dire vapor, that had cleft the ground, T'ingender with the night, and blast the day; Or like a pestilence, that should display Infection through the world: which, thus, I doe. Discouers Catiline in his study. Plvto be at thy councells; and into Thy darker bosome enter Sylla's spirit: All, that was mine, and bad, thy brest inherit. Alas, how weake is that, for Catiline! Did I but say (vaine voice!) all that was mine? All, that the Gracchi, Cinna, Marivs would; What now, had I a body againe, I could, Comming from hell; what Fiends would wish should be; And Hannibal could not haue wish'd to see: Thinke thou, and practice. Let the long-hid seeds Of treason, in thee, now shoot forth in deeds, Ranker then horror; and thy former facts Not fall in mention, but to vrge new acts: Conscience of them prouoke thee on to more. Be still thy incests, murders, rapes before Thy sense; thy forcing first a Vestall nunne; Thy parricide, late, on thine owne onely sonne, After his mother; to make emptie way For thy last wicked nuptialls; worse, then they, That blaze that act of thy incestuous life, Which got thee, at once, a daughter, and a wife. I leaue the slaughters that thou didst for me, Of Senators; for which, I hid for thee Thy murder of thy brother, (being so brib'd) And writ him in the list of my proscrib'd After thy fact, to saue thy little shame: Thy incest, with thy sister, I not name. These are too light. Fate will haue thee pursue Deedes, after which, no mischiefe can be new; The ruine of thy countrey: thou wert built For such a worke, and borne for no lesse guilt. What though defeated once th'hast beene, and knowne, Tempt it againe: That is thy act, or none. What all the seuerall ills, that visite earth, (Brought forth by night, with a sinister birth) Plagues, famine, fire could not reach vnto, The sword, nor surfets; let thy furie doe: Make all past, present, future ill thine owne; And conquer all example, in thy one. Nor let thy thought find any vacant time To hate an old, but still a fresher crime Drowne the remembrance: let not mischiefe cease, But, while it is in punishing, encrease. Conscience, and care die in thee; and be free Not heau'n it selfe from thy impietie: Let night grow blacker with thy plots; and day, At shewing but thy head forth, start away From this halfe-spheare: and leaue Romes blinded walls T'embrace lusts, hatreds, slaughters, funeralls, And not recouer sight, till their owne flames Doe light them to their ruines. All the names Of thy confederates, too, be no lesse great In hell, then here: that, when we would repeat Our strengths in muster, we may name you all, And Furies, vpon you, for Furies, call. Whilst, what you doe, may strike them into feares, Or make them grieue, and wish your mischiefe theirs. Catiline. It is decree'd. Nor shall thy Fate, Ã´ Rome, Resist my vow. Though hills were set on hills, And seas met seas, to guard thee; I would through: I, plough vp rocks, steepe as the Alpes, in dust; And laue the Tyrrhene waters, into clouds; But I would reach thy head, thy head, proud citie. The ills, that I haue done, cannot be safe But by attempting greater; and I feele A spirit, within me, chides my sluggish hands, And sayes, they haue beene innocent too long. Was I a man, bred great, as Rome her selfe? One, form'd for all her honors, all her glories? Equall to all her titles? that could stand Close vp, with Atlas; and sustaine her name As strong, as he doth heau'n? And, was I, Of all her brood, mark'd out for the repulse By her no voice, when I stood Candidate, To be commander in the Pontick warre? I will, hereafter, call her step-dame, euer. If shee can loose her nature, I can loose My pietie, and in her stony entrailes Dig me a seate: where, I will liue againe, The labour of her wombe, and be a burden, Weightier then all the prodigies, and monsters, That shee hath teem'd with, since shee first knew Mars. Catiline , Avrelia. VVho's there? Avr. 'Tis I. Cat. Avrelia? Avr. Yes. Cat. Appeare, And breake, like day, my beautie, to this circle: Vpbraid thy PhÅbus, that he is so long In mounting to that point, which should giue thee Thy proper splendor. Wherefore frownes my sweet? Haue I too long beene absent from these lips, He kisseth them. This cheeke, these eyes? What is my trespasse? speake. Avr. It seemes, you know, that can accuse your selfe. Cat. I will redeeme it. Avr. Still, you say so. When? Cat. When Orestilla, by her bearing well These my retirements, and stolne times for thought, Shall giue their effects leaue to call her Queene Of all the world, in place of humbled Rome. Avr. You court me, now. Cat. As I would alwayes, Loue, By this ambrosiack kisse, and this of nectar, Wouldst thou but heare as gladly, as I speake. Could my Avrelia thinke, I meant her lesse; When, wooing her, I first remou'd a wife, And then a sonne, to make my bed, and house Spatious, and fit t'embrace her? These were deeds Not t'haue begun with, but to end with more, And greater: âHe that, building, stayes at one âFloore, or the second, hath erected none. 'Twas how to raise thee, I was meditating; To make some act of mine answere thy loue: That loue, that, when my state was now quite sunke, Came with thy wealth, and weigh'd it vp againe, And made my 'emergent-fortune once more looke Aboue the maine; which, now, shall hit the starres, And stick my Orestilla, there, amongst 'hem, If any tempest can but make the billow, And any billow can but lift her greatnesse. But, I must pray my loue, shee will put on Like habites with my selfe. I haue to doe With many men, and many natures. Some, That must be blowne, and sooth'd; as Lentvlvs, Whom I haue heau'd, with magnifying his bloud, And a vaine dreame, out of the Sybill's bookes, That a third man, of that great family, Whereof he is descended, the Cornelii, Should be a king in Rome: which I haue hir'd The flatt'ring Avgvres to interpret him, Cinna, and Sylla dead. Then, bold Cethegvs, Whose valour I haue turn'd into his poyson, And prais'd so into daring, as he would Goe on vpon the gods, kisse lightning, wrest The engine from the Cyclop's, and giue fire At face of a full cloud, and stand his ire: When I would bid him moue. Others there are, Whom enuy to the state drawes, and puts on, For contumelies receiu'd, (and such are sure ones) As Cvrivs, and the fore-nam'd Lentvlvs, Both which haue beene degraded, in the Senate, And must haue their disgraces, still, new rub'd, To make 'hem smart, and labour of reuenge. Others, whom meere ambition fires, and dole Of prouinces abroad, which they haue fain'd To their crude hopes, and I as amply promis'd: These, Lecca, Vargvnteivs, Bestia, Avtronivs. Some, whom their wants oppresse, as th'idle Captaynes Of Sylla's troops: and diuers Roman Knights (The profuse wasters of their patrimonies) So threatned with their debts as they will, now, Runne any desperate fortune, for a change. These, for a time, we must relieue, Avrelia, And make our house the safe-guard: like, for those, That feare the law, or stand within her gripe, For any act past, or to come. Such will From their owne crimes, be factious, as from ours. Some more there be, slight ayrelings, will be wonne, With dogs, and horses; or, perhaps, a whore; Which must be had: and, if they venter liues, For vs, Avrelia, we must hazard honors A little. Get thee store, and change of women, As I haue boyes; and giue 'hem time, and place, And all conniuence: be thy selfe, too, courtly; And entertayne, and feast, sit vp, and reuell; Call all the great, the faire, and spirited Dames Of Rome about thee; and beginne a fashion Of freedome, and community. Some will thanke thee, Though the sowre Senate frowne, whose heads must ake In feare, and feeling too. We must not spare Or cost, or modestie. It can but shew Like one of Ivno's, or of Iove's disguises, In either thee, or mee: and will as soone, When things succeed, be throwne by, or let fall, As is a vaile put off, a visor chang'd, Or the scene shifted, in our theatersâ A noyse without. Who's that? It is the voyce of Lentvlvs. Avr. Or of Cethegvs. Cat. In, my faire Avrelia, And thinke vpon these arts. They must not see, How farre you are trusted with these priuacies; Though, on their shoulders, necks, and heads you rise. Lentvlvs , Cethegvs, Catiline. It is, me thinks, a morning, full of fate! It riseth slowly, as her sollen carre Had all the weights of sleepe, and death hung at it! Shee is not rosy-finger'd, but swolne black! Her face is like a water, turn'd to bloud, And her sick head is bound about with clouds, As if shee threatned night, ere noone of day! It does not looke, as it would haue a haile, Or health, wish'd in it, as on other mornes. Cet. Why, all the fitter, Lentvlvs: our comming Is not for salutation, we haue businesse. Cat. Said nobly, braue Cethegvs. Where's Avtronivs? Cet. Is he not come? Cat. Not here. Cet. Nor Vargvnteivs? Cat. Neither. Cet. A fire in their beds, and bosomes, That so will serue their sloth, rather then vertue. They are no Romanes, and at such high need As now. Len. Both they, Longinvs, Lecca, Cvrivs, Fvlvivs, Gabinivs, gaue me word, last night, By Lvcivs Bestia, they would all be here, And early. Cet. Yes? As you, had I not call'd you. Come, we all sleepe, and are meere dormice; flies, A little lesse then dead: more dulnesse hangs On vs, then on the morne. W'are spirit-bound, In ribs of ice; our whole blouds are one stone; And honor cannot thaw vs; nor our wants: Though they burne, hot as feuers, to our states. Cat. I muse they would be tardy, at an houre Of so great purpose. Cet. If the gods had call'd Them, to a purpose, they would iust haue come With the same tortoyse speed! that are thus slow To such an action, which the gods will enuy: As asking no lesse meanes, then all their powers Conioyn'd, t'effect. I would haue seene Rome burn't, By this time; and her ashes in an vrne: The kingdome of the Senate, rent a-sunder; And the degenerate, talking gowne runne frighted, Out of the aire of Italie. Cat. Spirit of men! Thou, heart of our great enterprise! how much I loue these voices in thee! Cet. O, the dayes Of Sylla's sway, when the free sword tooke leaue To act all that it would! Cat. And was familiar With entrailes, as our Augures! Cet. Sonnes kild fathers, Brothers their brothers. Cat. And had price, and praise. All hate had licence giuen it: all rage raines. Cet. Slaughter bestrid the streets, and stretch'd himselfe To seeme more huge; whilst to his stayned thighes The gore he drew flow'd vp: and carryed downe Whole heaps of limmes, and bodies, through his arch. No age was spar'd, no sexe. Cat. Nay, no degree. Cet. Not infants, in the porch of life were free. The sick, the old, that could but hope a day Longer, by natures bountie, not let stay. Virgins, and widdowes, matrons, pregnant wiues, All dyed. Cat. 'Twas crime enough, that they had liues. To strike but onely those, that could doe hurt, Was dull, and poore. Some fell to make the number, As some the prey. Cet. The rugged Charon fainted, And ask'd a nauy, rather then a boate, To ferry ouer the sad world that came: The mawes, and dens of beasts could not receiue The bodies, that those soules were frighted from; And e'en the graues were fild with men, yet liuing, Whose flight, and feare had mix'd them, with the dead. Cat. And this shall be againe, and more, and more, Now Lentvlvs, the third Cornelivs, Is to stand vp in Rome. Len. Nay, vrge not that Is so vncertaine. Cat. How! Len. I meane, not clear'd. And, therefore, not to be reflected on. Cat. The Sybill's leaues vncertayne? or the comments Of our graue, deepe, diuining men not cleare? Len. All prophecies, you know, suffer the torture. Cat. But this, already, hath confess'd, without. And so beene weigh'd, examin'd, and compar'd, As't were malicious ignorance in him, Would faint in the beliefe. Len. Doe you beleeue it? Cat. Doe I loue Lentvlvs? or pray to see it? Len. The Augures all are constant, I am meant. Cat. They had lost their science else. Len. They count from Cinna. Cat. And Sylla next, and so make you the third; All that can say the sunne is ris'n, must thinke it. Len. Men marke me more, of late, as I come forth! Cat. Why, what can they doe lesse? Cinna, and Sylla Are set, and gone: and we must turne our eyes On him that is, and shines. Noble Cethegvs, But view him with me, here! He lookes, already, As if he shooke a scepter, o're the Senate, And the aw'd purple dropt their rods, and axes! The statues melt againe; and houshold gods In grones confesse the trauaile of the citie; The very walls sweat bloud before the change; And stones start out to ruine, ere it comes. Cet. But he, and we, and all are idle still. Len. I am your creature, Sergivs: And what ere The great Cornelian name shall winne to be, It is not Augury, nor the Sybils bookes, But Catiline that makes it. Cat. I am shaddow To honor'd Lentvlvs, and Cethegvs here, Who are the heires of Mars. Cet. By Mars himselfe, Catiline is more my parent: for whose vertue Earth cannot make a shaddow great inough, Though enuy should come too. O, there they'are. Now we shall talke more, though we yet doe nothing. Avtronivs , Vargvnteivs, Longinvs, Cvrivs, Lecca, Bestia, Fvlvivs, Gabinivs, &amp;c. To them. Haile Lvcivs Catiline. Var. Haile noble Sergivs. Lon. Haile Pvb: Lentvl'. Cvr. Haile the third Corneli'. Lec. Caivs Cethegvs haile. Cet. Haile sloth, and words, In steed of men, and spirits. Cat. Nay, deare Caivsâ Get. Are your eyes yet vnsee'ld? Dare they looke day In the dull face? Cat. Hee's zealous, for the'affaire, And blames your tardy comming, gentlemen. Cet. Vnlesse, we had sold our selues to sleepe, and ease, And would be our slaues slauesâ Cat. Pray you forbeare. Cet. The north is not so starke, and cold. Cat. Cethegvsâ Bes. We shall redeeme all, if your fire will let vs. Cat. You are too full of lightning, noble Caivs. Boy, see all doores be shut, that none approch vs, On this part of the house. Goe you, and bid The Priest, he kill the slaue I mark'd last night; And bring me of his bloud, when I shall call him: Till then, wait all without. Var. How is't, Avtronivs! Avt. Longinvs? Lon. Cvrivs? Cvr. Lecca? Var. Feele you nothing? Lon. A strange, vn-wonted horror doth inuade me, A darknesse comes ouer the place. I know not what it is! Lec. The day goes back, Or else my senses! Cvr. As at Atrevs feast! Fvl. Darknesse growes more, and more! Len. The vestall flame, A grone of many people is heard vnder ground. I thinke, be out. Gab. What grone was that? Cet. Our phant'sies. Strike fire, out of our selues, and force a day. Another. Avt. Againe it sounds! Bes. As all the citie gaue it! Cet. We feare what our selues faine. Var. What light is this? A fiery light appeares. Cvr. Looke forth. Len. It still growes greater! Lec. From whence comes it? Lon. A bloudy arme it is, that holds a pine Lighted, aboue the Capitoll! and, now, It waues vnto vs! Cat. Braue, and omenous! Our enterprise is seal'd. Cet. In spight of darkenesse, That would discountenance it. Looke no more; We loose time, and our selues. To what we came for, Speake Lvcivs, we attend you. Cat. Noblest Romanes, If you were lesse, or that your faith, and vertue Did not hold good that title, with your bloud, I should not, now, vnprofitably spend My selfe in words, or catch at empty hopes, By ayrie wayes, for solide certainties. But since in many, and the greatest dangers, I still haue knowne you no lesse true, then valiant, And that I tast, in you, the same affections, To will, or nill, to thinke things good, or bad, Alike with me: (which argues your firme friendship) I dare the boldlier, with you, set on foot, Or leade, vnto this great, and goodliest action. What I haue thought of it afore, you all Haue heard apart. I then express'd my zeale Vnto the glorie; now, the neede enflames me: When I fore-thinke the hard conditions, Our states must vnder-goe, except, in time, We doe redeeme our selues to libertie, And breake the yron yoke, forg'd for our necks. For, what lesse can we call it? when we see The common-wealth engross'd so by a few, The giants of the state, that doe, by turnes, Enioy her, and defile her! All the earth, Her Kings, and Tetrarchs, are their tributaries; People, and nations, pay them hourely stipends: The riches of the world flowes to their coffers, And not, to Romes. While (but those few) the rest, How euer great we are, honest, and valiant, Are hearded with the vulgar; and so kept, As we were onely bred, to consume corne; Or weare out wooll; to drinke the cities water; Vngrac'd, without authoritie, or marke; Trembling beneath their rods: to whom, (if all Were well in Rome) we should come forth bright axes. All places, honors, offices are theirs! Or where they will conferre 'hem! They leaue vs The dangers, the repulses, iudgements, wants: Which how long will you beare, most valiant spirits? Were we not better to fall, once, with vertue, Then draw a wretched, and dishonor'd breath, To loose with shame, when these mens pride will laugh? I call the faith of gods, and men to question, The power is in our hands; our bodies able; Our mindes as strong; o'th' contrary, in them, All things growne aged, with their wealth, and yeeres: There wants, but onely to beginne the businesse, The issue is certaine. Cet., Lon. On, let vs goe on. Cvr., Bes. Goe on, braue Sergivs. Cat. It doth strike my soule, (And, who can scape the stroke, that hath a soule, Or, but the smallest aire of man within him?) To see them swell with treasure; which they powre Out i'their riots, eating, drinking, building, I, i'the sea! planing of hills with valleyes; And raysing vallies aboue hills! whilst we Haue not, to giue our bodies necessaries. They ha' their change of houses, mannors, lordships; We scarce a fire, or poore houshold Lar! They buy rare Atticke statues, Tyrian hangings, Ephesian pictures, and Corinthian plate, Attalicke garments, and now, new-found gemmes, Since Pompey went for Asia, which they purchase At price of prouinces! The riuer Phasis Cannot affoord 'hem fowle; nor Lucrine lake Oysters enow: Circei too, is search'd To please the witty gluttony of a meale! Their ancient habitations they neglect, And set vp new; then, if the eccho like not In such a roome, they pluck downe those, build newer, Alter them too: and, by all frantick wayes, Vexe their wild wealth, as they molest the people, From whom they force it! yet, they cannot tame, Or ouer-come their riches! Not, by making Bathes, orchards, fish-pooles! letting in of seas Here! and, then there, forcing 'hem out againe, With mountaynous heaps, for which the earth hath lost Most of her ribs, as entrailes! being now Wounded no lesse for marble, then for gold. We, all this while, like calme, benum'd Spectators, Sit, till our seates doe cracke; and doe not heare The thundring ruines: whilst, at home, our wants, Abroad, our debts doe vrge vs; our states daily Bending to bad, our hopes to worse: and, what Is left, but to be crush'd? Wake, wake braue friends, And meet the libertie you oft haue wish'd for. Behold, renowne, riches, and glory court you. Fortune holds out these to you, as rewards. Me thinkes (though I were dumbe) th'affaire it selfe The opportunity, your needs, and dangers, With the braue spoile the warre brings, should inuite you. Vse me your generall, or souldier: neither, My minde, nor body shall be wanting to you. And, being Consul, I not doubt t'effect, All that you wish, if trust not flatter me, And you'd not rather still be slaues, then free. Cet. Free, free. Lon. 'Tis freedom. Cvr. Freedom we all stand for. Cat. Why, these are noble voyces! Nothing wants then, But that we take a solemne sacrament, To strengthen our designe. Cet. And so to act it. Differring hurts, where powers are so prepar'd. Avt. Yet, ere we enter into open act, (With fauour) 'twere no losse, if 't might be enquir'd, What the condition of these armes would be? Var. I, and the meanes, to carry vs through? Cat. How, friends! Thinke you, that I would bid you, graspe the winde? Or call you to th'embracing of a cloud? Put your knowne valures on so deare a businesse, And haue no other second then the danger, Nor other gyrlond then the losse? Become Your owne assurances. And, for the meanes, Consider, first, the starke securitie The common wealth is in now; the whole Senate Sleepy, and dreaming no such violent blow; Their forces all abroad; of which the greatest, That might annoy vs most, is fardest off, In Asia, vnder Pompey: those, neare hand, Commanded, by our friends; one army in Spaine, By Cnevs Piso; th'other in Mauritania, By Nvcerinvs; both which I haue firme, And fast vnto our plot. My selfe, then, standing Now to be Consul; with my hop'd Colleague Caivs Antonivs; one, no lesse engag'd By his wants then we: and, whom i'haue power to melt, And cast in any mould. Beside, some others That will not yet be nam'd, (both sure, and great ones) Who, when the time comes, shall declare themselues, Strong, for our party: so, that no resistance In nature can be thought. For our reward, then, First, all our debts are paid; dangers of law, Actions, decrees, iudgements against vs quitted; The rich men, as in Sylla's times, proscrib'd, And publication made of all their goods; That house is yours; that land is his; those waters, Orchards, and walkes a third's; he has that honor, And he that office: Such a prouince falls To Vargvnteivs: this to Avtronivs: that To bold Cethegvs: Rome to Lentvlvs. You share the world, her magistracies, priest-hoods, Wealth, and felicitie amongst you, friends; And Catiline your seruant. Would you, Cvrivs, Reuenge the contumely stuck vpon you, In being remoued from the Senate? Now, Now, is your time. Would Pvblivs Lentvlvs Strike, for the like disgrace? Now, is his time. Would stout Longinvs walke the streets of Rome, Facing the PrÃ¦tor? Now, has he a time To spurne, and tread the fasces, into dirt, Made of the vsurers, and the Lictors braines. Is there a beautie, here in Rome, you loue? An enemie you would kill? What head's not yours? Whose wife, which boy, whose daughter, of what race, That th'husband, or glad parents shall not bring you, And boasting of the office? only, spare Your selues, and you haue all the earth beside, A field, to exercise your longings in. I see you rais'd, and reade your forward mindes High, in your faces. Bring the wine, and bloud You haue prepar'd there. Lon. How! Cat. I'haue kill'd a slaue, And of his bloud caus'd to be mixt with wine. Fill euery man his bowle. There cannot be A fitter drinke, to make this sanction in. Here, I beginne the sacrament to all. O, for a clap of thunder, now, as loud, As to be heard through-out the vniuerse, To tell the world the fact, and to applaud it. Be firme, my hand; not shed a drop: but powre Fiercenesse into me, with it, and fell thirst Of more, and more, till Rome be left as bloud-lesse, As euer her feares made her, or the sword. And, when I leaue to wish this to thee, step-dame, Or stop, to effect it, with my powers fainting; So may my bloud be drawne, and so drunke vp As is this slaues. Lon. And so be mine. Len. And mine. They drinke. Avt. And mine. Var. And mine. Cet. Swell mee my bowle yet fuller. Here, I doe drinke this, as I would doe Cato's, Or the new fellow Cicero's: with that vow Which Catiline hath giuen. Cvr. So doe I. Lec. And I. Bes. And I. Fvl. And I. Gab. And all of vs. Cat. Why, now's the businesse safe, and each man strengthned. Sirrah, what aile you? Pag. Nothing. Bes. Somewhat modest. Cat. Slaue, I will strike your soule out, with my foot, He spies one of his boyes not answereâ Let me but find you againe with such a face: You whelpâ Bes. Nay, Lvcivs. Cat. Are you coying it, When I command you to be free, and generall To all? Bes. You'll be obseru'd. Cat. Arise,and shew But any least auersion i'your looke To him that bourds you next, and your throat opens. Noble confederates, thus farre is perfect. Only your suffrages I will expect, At the assembly for the choosing Consuls, And all the voyces you can make by friends To my election. Then, let me worke out Your fortunes, and mine owne. Meane while, all rest Seal'd vp, and silent, as when rigid frosts Haue bound vp brookes, and riuers, forc'd wild beasts Vnto their caues, and birds into the woods, Clownes to their houses, and the countrey sleeps: That, when the sodaine thaw comes, we may breake Vpon 'hem like a deluge, bearing downe Halfe Rome before vs, and inuade the rest With cryes, and noise able to wake the vrnes Of those are dead, and make their ashes feare, The horrors, that doe strike the world, should come Loud, and vnlook'd for: till they strike, be dumbe. Cet. Oraculous Sergivs! Len. God-like Catiline! Chorvs. Can nothing great, and at the height Remaine so long? but it's owne weight Will ruine it? Or, is't blinde chance, That still desires new states t'aduance, And quit the old? Else, why must Rome, Be by it selfe; now, ouer-come? Hath shee not foes inow of those, Whom shee hath made such, and enclose Her round about? Or, are they none, Except shee first become her owne? O wretchednesse of greatest states, To be obnoxious to these fates: That cannot keepe, what they doe gaine; And what they raise so ill sustaine! Rome, now, is Mistris of the whole World, sea, and land, to either pole; And euen that fortune will destroy The power that made it: shee doth ioy So much in plentie, wealth, and ease, As, now, th'excesse is her disease. Shee builds in gold; and, to the starres; As, if shee threatned heau'n with warres: And seekes for hell, in quarries deepe, Giuing the fiends, that there doe keepe, A hope of day. Her women weare The spoiles of nations, in an eare, Chang'd for the treasure of a shell; And, in their loose attires, doe swell More light then sailes, when all windes play: Yet, are the men more loose then they! More kemb'd, and bath'd, and rub'd, and trim'd, More sleek'd, more soft, and slacker limm'd; As prostitute: so much, that kinde May seeke it selfe there, and not finde. They eate on beds of silke, and gold; At yuorie tables; or, wood sold Dearer then it: and, leauing plate, Doe drinke in stone of higher rate. They hunt all grounds; and draw all seas; Foule euery brooke, and bush; to please Their wanton tasts: and, in request Haue new, and rare things; not the best! Hence comes that wild, and vast expence, That hath enforc'd Romes vertue, thence, Which simple pouerty first made: And, now, ambition doth inuade Her state, with eating auarice, Riot, and euery other vice. Decrees are bought, and lawes are sold, Honors, and offices for gold; The peoples voyces: and the free Tongues, in the Senate, bribed bee. Such ruine of her manners Rome Doth suffer now, as shee's become (Without the gods it soone gaine-say) Both her owne spoiler, and owne prey. So, Asia, 'art thou cru'lly euen With vs, for all the blowes thee giuen; When we, whose vertue conquer'd thee, Thus, by thy vices, ruin'd bee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Fvlvia , Galla, Servant. Those roomes doe smell extremely. Bring my glasse, And table hither. Galla. Gal. Madame. Fvl. Looke Within, i' my blew cabinet, for the pearle I'had sent me last, and bring it. Gal. That from Clodivs? Fvl. From Caivs Caesar. You'are for Clodivs, still. Or Cvrivs. Sirrha, if Qvintvs Cvrivs come, I am not in fit moode; I keepe my chamber: Giue warning so, without. Gal. Is this it? madame. Fvl. Yes, helpe to hang it in mine eare. Gal. Beleeue me, It is a rich one, madame. Fvl. I hope so: It should not be worne there else. Make an end, And binde my haire vp. Gal. As 'twas yesterday? Fvl. No, nor the t'other day. When knew you me Appeare, two dayes together, in one dressing? Gal. Will you ha't i'the globe, or spire? Fvl. How thou wilt; Any way, so thou wilt doe it, good impertinence: Thy company, if I slept not very well. A nights, would make me, an errant foole, with questions. Gal. Alas, madameâ Fvl. Nay, gentle halfe o' the dialogue, cease: Gal. I doe it, indeed, but for your exercise, As your physitian bids me. Fvl. How Do's he bid you To anger me for exercise? Gal. Not to anger you, But stirre your bloud a little: There's difference Betweene luke-warme, and boyling, madame. Fvl. Iove! Shee meanes to cooke me, I thinke? Pray you, ha' done. Gal. I meane to dresse you, madame. Fvl. O, my Ivno, Be friend to me! Offring at wit, too? Why, Galla! Where hast thou been? Gal. Why? madam! Fvl. What hast thou done With thy poore innocent selfe? Gal. Wherefore! sweet madame! Fvl. Thus to come forth, so sodainely, a wit-worme? Gal. It pleases you to flout one. I did dreame Of lady Semproniaâ Fvl. O, the wonder is out. That did infect thee? Well, and how? Gal. Me thought, Shee did discourse the bestâ Fvl. That euer thou heard'st? Gal. Yes. Fvl. I' thy sleepe? Of what was her discourse? Gal. O'the republike, madame, and the state, And how shee was in debt, and where shee meant To raise fresh summes: Shee's a great states-woman! Fvl. Thou dream'st all this? Gal. No, but you know she is, madam, And both a mistris of the latine tongue, And of the greeke. Fvl. I, but I neuer dreamt it, Galla, As thou hast done, and therefore you must pardon me. Gal. Indeed, you mock me, madame. Fvl. Indeed, no. Forth, with your learned lady. Shee has a wit, too? Gal. A very masculine one. Fvl. A shee-Critick, Galla? And can compose, in verse, and make quick iests, Modest, or otherwise? Gal. Yes, madame. Fvl. Shee can sing, too? And play on instruments? Gal. Of all kindes, they say. Fvl. And doth dance rarely? Gal. Excellent! So, well, As a bald Senator made a iest, and said, 'Twas better, then an honest woman need. Fvl. Tut, shee may beare that. Few wise womens honesties Will doe their courtship hurt. Gal. Shee's liberall too, madame. Fvl. What! of her money, or her honor, pray thee? Gal. Of both, you know not which shee doth spare least. Fvl. A comely commendation. Gal. Troth, 'tis pitty, Shee is in yeeres. Fvl. Why, Galla? For it is. Fvl. O, is that all? I thought thou hadst had a reason. Gal. Why, so I haue. Shee has beene a fine lady, And, yet, shee dresses her selfe (except you, madame) One o'the best in Rome: and paints, and hides Her decayes very well. Fvl. They say, it is Rather a visor, then a face shee weares. Gal. They wrong her verily, madame, shee do's sleeke With crums of bread, and milke, and lies a nights In as neat glouesâBut shee is faine of late To seeke, more then shee's sought to (the fame is) And so spends that way. Fvl. Thou know'st all! But, Galla, What say you to Catilines lady, Orestilla? There is the gallant! Gal. Shee do's well. Shee has Very good sutes, and very rich: but, then, Shee cannot put 'hem on. Shee knowes not how To weare a garment. You shall haue her all Iewels, and gold sometimes, so that her selfe Appeares the least part of her selfe. No' in troth, As I liue, madame, you put 'hem all downe With your meere strength of iudgement! and doe draw, too, The world of Rome to follow you! you attire Your selfe so diuersly! and with that spirit! Still to the noblest humors! They could make Loue to your dresse, although your face were away, they say. Fvl. And body too, and ha' the better match on't? Say they not so too, Galla? Now! What newes Trauailes your count'nance with? Ser. If't please you, madame, The lady Sempronia is lighted at the gate; Gal. Castor, my dreame, my dreame. Ser. And comes to see you. Gal. For Venvs sake, good madame see her. Fvl. Peace, The foole is wild, I thinke. Gal. And heare her talke, Sweet madame, of state-matters, and the Senate. Sempronia , Fvlvia, Galla. Fvlvia, good wench, how dost thou? Fvl. Well, Sempronia. Whither are you thus early addrest? Sem. To see Avrelia Orestilla. Shee sent for me. I came to call thee, with me, wilt thou goe? Fvl. I cannot now, in troth, I haue some letters To write, and send away. Sem. Alas, I pitty thee. I ha' beene writing all this night (and am So very weary) vnto all the tribes, And centuries, for their voyces, to helpe Catiline, In his election. We shall make him Consul, I hope, amongst vs. Crassvs, I, and Caesar Will carry it for him. Fvl. Do's he stand for't? Sem. H'is the chiefe Candidate. Fvl. Who stands beside? (Giue me some wine, and poulder for my teeth. Sem. Here's a good pearle in troth! Fvl. A pretty one. Sem. A very orient one!) There are competitors, Caivs Antonivs, Pvblivs Galba, Lvcivs Cassivs Longinvs, Qvintvs Cornificivs, Caivs Licinivs, and that talker, Cicero. But Catiline, and Antonivs will be chosen. For foure o' the other, Licinivs, Longinvs, Galba, and Cornificivs will giue way. And Cicero they will not choose. Fvl. No? why? Sem. It will be cross'd, by the nobilitie. Gal. (How shee do's vnderstand the common businesse!) Sem. Nor, were it fit. He is but a new fellow, An in-mate, here, in Rome (as Catiline calls him) And the Patricians should doe very ill, To let the Consul-ship be so defil'd As't would be, if he obtain'd it! A meere vpstart, That has no pedigree, no house, no coate, No ensignes of a family? Fvl. He' has vertue. Sem. Hang vertue, where there is no bloud: 'tis vice, And, in him, sawcinesse. Why should he presume To be more learned, or more eloquent, Then the nobilitie? or boast any qualitie Worthy a nobleman, himselfe not noble? Fvl. 'Twas vertue onely, at first, made all men noble. Sem. I yeeld you, it might, at first, in Romes poore age; When both her Kings, and Consuls held the plough, Or garden'd well: But, now, we ha' no need, To digge, or loose our sweat for't. We haue wealth, Fortune and ease, and then their stock, to spend on, Of name, for vertue; which will beare vs out 'Gainst all new commers: and can neuer faile vs, While the succession stayes. And, we must glorifie, A mushrome? one of yesterday? a fine speaker? 'Cause he has suck'd at Athens? and aduance him, To our owne losse? No, Fvlvia. There are they Can speake greeke too, if need were. Caesar, and I, Haue sate vpon him; so hath Crassvs, too: And others. We haue all decreed his rest, For rising farder. Gal. Excellent rare lady! Fvl. Sempronia, you are beholden to my woman, here. Shee do's admire you. Sem. O good Galla, how dost thou? Gal. The better, for your learned ladiship. Sem. Is this grey poulder, a good dentifrice? Fvl. You see I vseit. Sem. I haue one is whiter. Fvl. It may be so. Sem. Yet this smells well. Gal. And clenses Very well, madame, and resists the crudities. Sem. Fvlvia, I pray thee, who comes to thee, now? Which of our great Patricians? Fvl. Faith, I keepe No catalogue of 'hem. Sometimes I haue one, Sometimes another, as the toy takes their blouds. Sem. Thou hast them all. Faith, when was Qvintvs Cvrivs, Thy speciall seruant, here? Fvl. My speciall seruant? Sem. Yes, thy idolater, I call him. Fvl. He may be yours, If you doe like him. Sem. How! Fvl. He comes, not, here, I haue forbid him, hence. Sem. Venvs forbid! Fvl. Why? Sem. Your so constant louer. Fvl. So much the rather. I would haue change. So would you too, I am sure. And now, you may haue him. Sem. Hee's fresh yet, Fvlvia: Beware, how you doe tempt me. Fvl. Faith, for me, He' is somewhat too fresh, indeed. The salt is gone, That gaue him season. His good gifts are done. He do's not yeeld the crop that he was wont. And, for the act, I can haue secret fellowes, With backs worth ten of him, and shall please me (Now that the land is fled) a myriade better. Sem. And those one may command. Fvl. 'Tis true: these Lordings, Your noble Faunes, they are so imperious, saucy, Rude, and as boistrous as Centaures, leaping A lady, at first sight. Sem. And must be borne Both with, and out, they thinke. Fvl. Tut, Ile obserue None of 'hem all: nor humour 'hem a iot Longer, then they come laden in the hand, And say, here's t'one, for th'tother. Sem. Do's Caesar giue well? Fvl. They shall all giue, and pay well, that come here, If they will haue it: and that iewells, pearle, Plate, or round summes, to buy these. I'am not taken With a cob-swan, or a high-mounting bull, As foolish Leda, and Evropa were, But the bright gold, with Danae. For such price, I would endure, a rough, harsh Ivpiter, Or ten such thundring gamsters: and refraine To laugh at 'hem, till they are gone, with my much suffring. Sem. Th'art a most happy wench, that thus canst make Vse of thy youth, and freshnesse, in the season: And hast it, to make vse of. Fvl. (Which is the happinesse.) Sem. I am, now, faine to giue to them, and keepe Musique, and a continuall table, to inuite 'hem; Fvl. (Yes, and they study your kitchin, more then you) Sem. Eate my selfe out with vsury, and my lord, too, And all my officers, and friends beside, To procure moneyes, for the needfull charge I must beat, to haue 'hem: and, yet, scarce Can I atchieue 'hem, so. Fvl. Why, that's because You affect yong faces onely, and smooth chinnes, Sempronia. If youl'd loue beards, and bristles, (One with another, as others doe) or wrinklesâ Who's that? Looke Galla. Gal. 'Tis the party, madame. Fvl. What party? Has he no name? Gal. 'Tis Qvintvs Cvrivs. Fvl. Did I not bid 'hem, say, I kept my chamber? Gal. Why, so they doe. Sem. Ile leaue you, Fvlvia. Fvl. Nay, good Sempronia, stay. Sem. In faith, I will not. Fvl. By Ivno, I would not see him. Sem. Ile not hinder you. Gal. You know, he will not be kept out, madame. Sem. No, Nor shall not, carefull Galla, by my meanes. Fvl. As I doe liue, Semproniaâ Sem. What needs this? Fvl. Goe, say, I am a-sleepe, and ill at ease. Sem. By Castor, no, I'le tell him, you are awake; And very well. Stay Galla; Farewell Fvlvia: I know my manners. Why doe you labour, thus, With action, against purpose? Qvintvs Cvrivs, Shee is, yfaith, here, and in disposition. Fvl. Spight, with your courtesie! How shall I be tortur'd! Cvrivs , Fvlvia, Galla. VVhereare you, faire one, that conceale your selfe, And keepe your beautie, within locks, and barres, here, Like a fooles treasure? Fvl. True, shee was a foole, When, first, shee shew'd it to a thiefe. Cvr. How, pretty solennesse! So harsh, and short? Fvl. The fooles artillery, sir. Cvr. Then, take my gowne off, for th'encounter. Fvl. Stay sir. I am not in the moode. Cvr. I'le put you into't. Fvl. Best put your selfe, i'your case againe, and keepe Your furious appetite warme, against you haue place for't. Cvr. What! doe you coy it? Fvl. No sir. I'am not proud. Cvr. I would you were. You thinke, this state becomes you? By Hercvles, it do's not. Looke i'your glasse, now, And see, how sciruely that countenance shewes; You would be loth to owne it. Fvl. I shall not change it. Cvr. Faith, but you must; and slack this bended brow; And shoot lesse scorne: there is a fortune comming Towards you, Daintie, that will take thee, thus, And set thee aloft, to tread vpon the head Of her owne statue, here, in Rome. Fvl. I wonder, Who let this promiser in! Did you, good diligence? Giue him his bribe, againe. Or if you had none, Pray you demand him, why he is so ventrous, To presse, thus, to my chamber, being forbidden, Both, by my selfe, and seruants? Cvr. How! This's handsome! And somewhat a new straine! Fvl. 'Tis not strain'd, sir. 'Tis very naturall. Cvr. I haue knowne it otherwise, Betweene the parties, though. Fvl. For your fore-knowledge, Thanke that, which made it. It will not be so, Hereafter, I assure you. Cvr. No, my mistris? Fvl. No, though you bring the same materialls. Cvr. Heare me, You ouer-act when you should vnder-doe. A little call your selfe againe, and thinke. If you doe this to practise on me' or finde At what forc'd distance you can hold your seruant; That' it be an artificiall trick, to enflame, And fire me more, fearing my loue may need it, As, heretofore, you ha' done: why, proceede. Fvl. As I ha' done heretofore? Cvr. Yes, when you'ld faine Your husbands iealousie, your seruants watches, Speake softly, and runne often to the dore, Or to the windore, forme strange feares that were not; As if the pleasure were lesse acceptable, That were secure. Fvl. You are an impudent fellow. Cvr. And, when you might better haue done it, at the gate, To take me in at the casement. Fvl. I take you in? Cvr. Yes, you my lady. And, then, being a-bed with you, To haue your well taught wayter, here, come running, And cry, her lord, and hide me without cause, Crush'd in a chest, or thrust vp in a chimney. When he, tame crow, was winking at his farme; Or, had he beene here, and present, would haue kept Both eyes, and beake seal'd vp, for sixe sesterces. Fvl. You haue a slanderous, beastly, vnwash'd tongue, I'your rude mouth, and sauouring your selfe, Vn-manner'd lord. Cvr. How now! Fvl. It is your title, sir. Who (since you ha' lost your owne good name, and know not What to loose more) care not, whose honor you wound, Or fame' you poyson with it. You should goe, And vent your selfe, i' the region, where you liue, Among the suburbe-brothels, bawdes, and brokers, Whither your broken fortunes haue design'd you. Cvr. Nay, then I must stop your fury, I see; and pluck The tragick visor off. Come, lady Cypris, He offers to force her, and shee drawes her knife. Know your owne vertues, quickly. Ile not be Put to the wooing of you thus, a-fresh, At euery turne, for all the Vrnvs in you. Yeeld, and be pliant; or by PollvxâHow now? Will Lais turne a Lycrece? Fvl. No, but by Castor, Hold off your rauishers hands, I pierce your heart, else. Ile not be put to kill my selfe, as shee did For you, sweet Tarqvine. What? doe you fall off? Nay, it becomes you graciously! Put not vp. You'll sooner draw your weapon on me, I thinke it, Then on the Senate, who haue cast you forth Disgracefully, to be the common tale Of the whole citie; base, infamous man! For, were you other, you would there imploy Your desperate dagger. Cvr. Fvlvia, you doe know The strengths you haue vpon me; doe not vse Your power too like a tyran: I can beare, Almost vntill you breake me. Fvl. I doe know, sir, So do's the Senate, too, know, you can beare. Cvr. By all the gods, that Senate will smart deepe For your vpbraidings. I should be right sorry To haue the meanes so to be veng'd on you, (At least, the will) as I shall shortly on them. But, goe you on still; fare you well, deare lady: You could not still be faire vnlesse you were proud. You will repent these moodes, and ere't be long, too. I shall ha' you come about, againe. Fvl. Doe you thinke so? Cvr. Yes, and I know so. Fvl. By what augurie? Cvr. By the faire entrailes of the matrons chests, Gold, pearle, and iewells, here in Rome, which Fvlvia Will then (but late) say that shee might haue shar'd: And, grieuing, misse. Fvl. Tut, all your promis'd mountaynes, And seas, I am so stalely acquainted withâ Cvr. But, when you see the vniuersall floud Runne by your coffers; that my lords, the Senators, Are sold for slaues, their wiues for bond-women, Their houses, and fine gardens giuen away, And all their goods, vnder the speare, at out cry, And you haue none of this; but are still Fvlvia, Or perhaps lesse, while you are thinking of it: You will aduise then, Coynesse, with your cushion, And looke o' your fingers; say, how you were wish'd; And so, he left you. Fvl. Call him againe, Galla: This is not vsuall! something hangs on this That I must winne out of him. Cvr. How now, melt you? Fvl. Come, you will laugh, now, at my easinesse! But, 'tis no miracle: Doues, they say, will bill, After their pecking, and their murmuring. Cvr. Yes, And then 'tis kindly. I would haue my loue Angrie, sometimes, to sweeten off the rest Of her behauiour. Fvl. You doe see, I studie How I may please you, then. But you thinke, Cvrivs, 'Tis couetise hath wrought me: if you loue me, Change that vnkinde conceipt. Cvr. By my lou'd soule, I loue thee, like to it; and 'tis my studie, More then mine owne reuenge, to make thee happy. Fvl. And 'tis that iust reuenge doth make me happy To heare you prosequute: and which, indeed, Hath wonne me, to you, more, then all the hope Of what can else be promis'd. I loue valour Better, then any lady loues her face, Or dressing: then my selfe do's. Let me grow Still, where I doe embrace. But, what good meanes Ha' you t'effect it? Shall I know your proiect? Cvr. Thou shalt, if thou'lt be gracious. Fvl. As I can be. Cvr. And wilt thou kisse me, then? Fvl. As close as shells Of cockles meet. Cvr. And print 'hem deepe? Fvl. Quite through Our subtle lips. Cvr. And often? Fvl. I will sow 'hem, Faster, then you can reape. What is your plot? Cvr. Why, now my Fvlvia lookes, like her bright name! And is her selfe! Fvl. Nay, answere me, your plot: I pray thee tell me, Qvintvs. Cvr. I, these sounds Become a mistris. Here is harmonie! Shee kisses and flatters him along still. When you are harsh, I see, the way to bend you Is not with violence, but seruice. Cruell, A lady is a fire: gentle, a light. Fvl. Will you not tell me, what I aske you? Cvr. All, That I can thinke, sweet loue, or my brest holds, Ile poure into thee. Fvl. What is your designe, then? Cvr. Ile tell thee; Catiline shall now be Consull: But, you will heare more, shortly. Fvl. Nay, deare loueâ Cvr. Ile speake it, in thine armes, let vs goe in. Rome will be sack'd, her wealth will be our prize; By publique ruine, priuate spirits must rise. Chorvs. Great father Mars, and greater Iove, By whose high auspice, Rome hath stood So long; and, first, was built in blood Of your great nephew, that then stroue Not with his brother, but your rites: Be present to her now, as then, And let not proud, and factious men Against your wills oppose their mights. Our Consuls, now, are to be made; O, put it in the publique voice To make a free, and worthy choice: Excluding such as would inuade The common wealth. Let whom we name Haue wisedome, fore-sight, fortitude, Be more with faith, then face endu'd, And studie conscience, aboue fame. Such, as not seeke to get the start In state, by power, parts, or bribes, Ambition's bawdes: but moue the tribes By vertue, modestie, desart. Such, as to iustice will adhere, What euer great one it offend: And from the'embraced truth not bend For enuy, hatred, gifts, or feare. That, by their deeds, will make it knowne, Whose dignitie they doe sustaine; And life, state, glorie, all they gaine, Count the republiques, not their owne. Such the old Brvti, Decii were, The Cipi, Cvrtii, who did giue Themselues for Rome: and would not liue, As men, good, only for a yeere. Such were the great Camilli, too; The Fabii, Scipio's; that still thought No worke, at price inough, was bought, That for their countrey they could doe. And, to her honor, so did knit; As all their acts were vnderstood The sinewes of the publique good: And they themselues, one soule, with it. These men were truely magistrates; These neither practis'd force, nor formes: Nor did they leaue the helme, in stormes! And such they are make happy states.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Cicero , Cato, Catvlvs, Antonivs, Crassvs, CÃ¦sar, Chorvs, Lictors. Great honors are great burdens: but, on whom They'are cast with enuie, he doth beare two loades. His cares must still be double to his ioyes, In any dignitie; where, if he erre He findes no pardon: and, for doing well A most small praise, and that wrung out by force. I speake this, Romanes, knowing what the weight Of the high charge, you haue trusted to me, is. Not, that thereby I would with art decline The good, or greatnesse of your benefit; For, I ascribe it to your singular grace, And vow, to owe it to no title else, Except the gods, that Cicero' is your Consul. I haue no vrnes; no dustie moniments; No broken images of ancestors, Wanting an eare, or nose; no forged tables Of long descents; to boast false honors from: Or be my vnder-takers to your trust. But a new man (as I am stil'd in Rome) Whom you haue dignified; and more, in whom Yo'haue cut a way, and left it ope for vertue Hereafter, to that place: which our great men Held shut vp, with all ramparts, for themselues. Nor haue but few of them, in time beene made Your Consuls, so; new men, before me, none: At my first suite; in my iust yeere; preferd To all competitors; and some the noblestâ Cra. Now the vaine swels. Caes. Vp glorie. Cic. And to haue Your loud consents, from your owne vtter'd voices; Not silent bookes: nor from the meaner tribes, But first, and last, the vniuersall concourse! This is my ioy, my gladnesse. But my care, My industrie, and vigilance now must worke, That still your counsells of me be approu'd; Both, by your selues, and those, to whom you haue, With grudge, prefer'd me: two things I must labour, That neither they vpbraid, nor you repent you. For euery lapse of mine will, now, be call'd Your error, if I make such. But, my hope is, So to beare through, and out, the Consul-ship, As spight shall ne're wound you, though it may me. And, for my selfe, I haue prepar'd this strength, To doe so well; as, if there happen ill Vnto me, it shall make the gods to blush: And be their crime, not mine, that I am enui'd. Caes. O confidence! more new, then is the man! Cic. I know well, in what termes I doe receiue The common wealth, how vexed, how perplex'd: In which, there's not that mischiefe, or ill fate, That good men feare not, wicked men expect not. I know, beside, some turbulent practises Alreadie on foot, and rumors of moe dangersâ Cra. Or you will make them, if there be none. Cic. Last, I know, 'twas this, which made the enuie, and pride Of the great Romane bloud bate, and giue way To my election. Cat. Marcvs Tvllivs, true; Our need made thee our Consul, and thy vertue. Caes. Cato, you will vn-doe him, with your praise. Cato. Caesar will hurt himselfe, with his owne enuie. Chor. The voice of Cato is the voice of Rome. Cato. The voice of Rome is the consent of heauen! And that hath plac'd thee, Cicero, at the helme, Where thou must render, now, thy selfe a man, And master of thy art. Each petty hand Can steere a ship becalm'd; but he that will Gouerne, and carry her to her ends, must know His tides, his currents; how to shift his sailes; What shee will beare in foule, what in faire weathers; Where her springs are, her leakes; and how to stop 'hem; What sands, what shelues, what rocks doe threaten her; The forces, and the natures of all winds, Gusts, stormes, and tempests; when her keele ploughs hell, And deck knocks heauen: then, to manage her, Becomes the name, and office of a pilot. Cic. Which I'le performe, with all the diligence, And fortitude I haue; not for my yeere, But for my life; except my life be lesse, And that my yeere conclude it: if it must, Your will, lou'd gods. This heart shall yet employ A day, an houre is left me, so, for Rome, As it shall spring a life, out of my death, To shine, for euer glorious in my facts. The vicious count their yeeres, vertuous their acts. Chor. Most noble Consul! Let vs wait him home. Caes. Most popular Consul he is growne, me thinks! Cra. How the rout cling to him! Caes. And Cato leads 'hem! Cra. You, his colleague, Antonivs, are not look't on. Ant. Not I, nor doe I care. Caes. He enioyes rest, And ease, the while. Let th'others spirit toile, And wake it out, that was inspir'd for turmoile. Catv. If all reports be true, yet, Caivs, Caesar, The time hath need of such a watch, and spirit. Caes. Reports? Doe you beleeue 'hem Catvlvs, Why, he do's make, and breed 'hem for the people; T'endeare his seruice to 'hem. Doe you not tast An art, that is so common? Popular men, They must create strange monsters, and then quell 'hem; To make their artes seeme something. Would you haue Such an Hercvlean actor in the scene, And not his Hydra? They must sweat no lesse To fit their properties, then t'expresse their parts. Cra. Treasons, and guiltie men are made in states Too oft, to dignifie the magistrates. Catv. Those states be wretched, that are forc'd to buy Their rulers fame, with their owne infamy. Cra. We therefore, should prouide that ours doe not. Caes. That will Antonivs make his care. Ant. I shall. Caes. And watch the watcher. Catv. Here comes Catiline. How do's he brooke his late repulse? Caes. I know not. But hardly sure. Cat. Longinvs, too, did stand? Caes. At first: but he gaue way vnto his friend. Catv. Who's that come? Lentvlvs? Caes. Yes. He is againe Taken into the Senate. Ant. And made PrÃ¦tor. Cat. I know't. He had my suffrage, next the Consuls; Caes. True, you were there, Prince of the Senate, then. Catiline , Antonivs, Catvlvs, CÃ¦sar, Crassvs, Longinvs, Lentvlvs. Haile noblest Romanes. The most worthy Consul, I gratulate your honor. Ant. I could wish It had beene happier, by your fellowship, Most noble Sergivs, had it pleas'd the people. Cati. It did not please the gods; who instruct the people: And their vnquestion'd pleasures must be seru'd. They know what's fitter for vs, then our selues; And 'twere impietie, to thinke against them. Catv. You beare it rightly, Lvcivs; and, it glads me, To find your thoughts so euen. Cati. I shall still Studie to make them such to Rome, and heauen. (I would with draw with you, a little, Ivlivs. Caes. Ile come home to you: Crassvs would not ha' you To speake to him, 'fore Qvintvs Catvlvs. Cati. I apprehend you.) No, when they shall iudge Honors conuenient for me, I shall haue 'hem, With a full hand: I know it. In meane time, They are no lesse part of the common-wealth, That doe obey, then those, that doe command. Catv. O, let me kisse your fore-head, Lvcivs. How are you wrong'd! Cati. By whom? Catv. Publike report. That giues you out, to stomack your repulse; And brooke it deadly. Cati. Sir, shee brookes not me. Beleeue me rather, and your selfe, now, of me: It is a kinde of slander, to trust rumour. Catv. I know it. And I could be angrie with it. Cati. So may not I. Where it concernes himselfe, Who's angrie at a slander, makes it true. Catv. Most noble Sergivs! This your temper melts me. Cra. Will you doe office to the Consul, Qvintvs? Caes. Which Cato, and the rout haue done the other? Catv. I wait, when he will goe. Be still your selfe. He wants no state, or honors, that hath vertue, Cati. Did I appeare so tame, as this man thinkes me? Look'd I so poore? so dead? So like that nothing, Which he calls vertuous? O my breast, breake quickly; And shew my friends my in-parts, lest they thinke I haue betraid 'hem. Lon. (Where's Gabinivs? Len. Gone. Lon. And Vargvnteivs? Len. Slipt away; all shrunke: Now that he mist the Consul-ship.) Cati. I am The scorne of bond-men; who are next to beasts. What can I worse pronounce my selfe, that's fitter? The owle of Rome, whom boyes, and girles will hout! That were I set vp, for that woodden god, That keeps our gardens, could not fright the crowes, Or the least bird from muiting on my head. Lon. ('Tis strange how he should misse it. Len. Isn't not stranger, The vpstart Cicero should carrie it so, By all consents, from men so much his masters? Lon. 'Tis true.) Cati. To what a shaddow, am I melted! Lon. (Antonivs wan it but by some few voices.) Cati. Strooke through, like aire, and feele it not. My wounds Close faster, then they're made. Len. The whole designe, And enterprise is lost by't. All hands quit it, Vpon his faile.) Cati. I grow mad at my patience. It is a visor that hath poison'd me. Would it had burnt me vp, and I died inward: My heart first turn'd to ashes. Lon. (Here's Cethegvs yet.) Catiline , Cethegvs, Lentvlvs, Longinvs, Cato. Repulse vpon repulse? An in-mate, Consul? That I could reach the axell, where the pinnes are, Which bolt this frame; that I might pull 'hem out, And pluck all into chaos, with my selfe. Cet. What, are we wishing now? Cati. Yes, my Cethegvs. Who would not fall with all the world about him? Cet. Not I, that would stand on it, when it falls; And force new nature out, to make another. These wishings tast of woman, not of Romane. Let vs seeke other armes. Cati. What should we doe? Cet. Doe, and not wish; something, that wishes take not: So sodaine, as the gods should not preuent, Nor scarce haue time, to feare. Cati. O noble Caivs! Cet. It likes me better, that you are not Consul. I would not goe through open dores, but breake 'hem; Swim to my ends, through bloud; or build a bridge Of carcasses; make on, vpon the heads Of men, strooke downe, like piles; to reach the liues Of those remaine, and stand: Then is't a prey, When danger stops, and ruine makes the way. Cati. How thou dost vtter me, braue soule, that may not, At all times, shew such as I am; but bend Vnto occasion? Lentvlvs, this man, If all our fire were out, would fetch downe new, Out of the hand of Iove; and riuet him To Caucasus, should he but frowne: and let His owne gaunt Eagle flie at him, to tire. Len. Peace, here comes Cato. Cati. Let him come, and heare. I will no more dissemble. Quit vs all; I, and my lou'd Cethegvs here, alone Will vndertake this giants warre, and carrie it. Len. What needs this, Lvcivs? Lon. Sergivs, be more warie. Cati. Now, Marcvs Cato, our new Consuls spie, What is your sowre austeritie sent t'explore. Cato. Nothing in thee, licentious Catiline: Halters, and racks cannot expresse from thee More, then thy deeds. 'Tis onely iudgement waits thee. Cati. Whose? Cato's? shall he iudge me? Cato. No, the gods; Who, euer, follow those, they goe not with: And Senate; who, with fire, must purge sicke Rome Of noisome citizens, whereof thou art one. Be gone, or else let me. 'Tis bane to draw The same aire with thee. Cet. Strike him. Len. Hold, good Caivs; Cet. Fear'st thou not, Cato? Cato. Rash Cethegvs, no. 'Twere wrong with Rome, when Catiline and thou Doe threat, if Cato fear'd. Cati. The fire you speake of If any flame of it approch my fortunes, Ile quench it, not with water, but with ruine. Cato. You heare this, Romanes. Cati. Beare it to the Consul. Cet. I would haue sent away his soule, before him. You are too heauie, Lentvlvs, and remisse; It is for you we labour, and the kingdome Promis'd you by the Sybill's. Cati. Which his PrÃ¦tor-ship, And some small flatterie of the Senate more, Will make him to forget. Len. You wrong me, Lvcivs. Lon. He will not need these spurres. Cet. The action needs 'hem. These things, when they proceed not, they goe backward. Len. Let vs consult then. Cet. Let vs, first, take armes. They that denie vs iust things, now, will giue All that we aske; if once they see our swords. Cat. Our obiects must be sought with wounds, not words. Cicero , Fvlvia. Is there a heauen? and gods? and can it be They should so slowly heare, so slowly see! Hath Iove no thunder? or is Iove become Stupide as thou art? Ã neere-wretched Rome, When both thy Senate, and thy gods doe sleepe, And neither thine, nor their owne states doe keepe! What will awake thee, heauen? what can excite Thine anger, if this practice be too light? His former drifts partake of former times, But this last plot was onely Catilines. O, that it were his last. But he, before Hath safely done so much, hee'll still dare more. Ambition, like a torrent, ne're lookes back; And is a swelling, and the last affection A high minde can put off: being both a rebell Vnto the soule, and reason, and enforceth All lawes, all conscience, treades vpon religion, And offereth violence to natures selfe. But, here, is that transcends it! A black purpose To confound nature: and to ruine that, Which neuer age, nor mankinde can repaire! Sit downe, good lady; Cicero is lost In this your fable: for, to thinke it true Tempteth my reason. It so farre exceedes All insolent fictions of the tragick scene! The common-wealth, yet panting, vnder-neath The stripes, and wounds of a late ciuill warre, Gasping for life, and scarce restor'd to hope; To seeke t'oppresse her, with new crueltie, And vtterly extinguish her long name, With so prodigious, and vnheard-of fiercenesse! What sinke of monsters, wretches of lost minds, Mad after change, and desp'rate in their states, Wearied, and gall'd with their necessities, (For all this I allow them) durst haue thought it? Would not the barbarous deeds haue beene beleeu'd, Of Marivs, and Sylla, by our children, Without this fact had rise forth greater, for them? All, that they did, was pietie, to this! They, yet, but murdred kinsfolke, brothers, parents, Rauish'd the virgins, and, perhaps, some matrons; They left the citie standing, and the temples: The gods, and maiestie of Rome were safe yet! These purpose to fire it, to dispoile them, (Beyond the other euils) and lay wast The farre-triumphed world: for, vnto whom Rome is too little, what can be inough? Fvl. 'Tis true, my lord, I had the same discourse. Cic. And, then, to take a horride sacrament In humane bloud, for execution Of this their dire designe; which might be call'd The height of wickednesse: but that, that was higher, For which they did it! Fvl. I assure your lordship, The extreme horror of it almost turn'd me To aire, when first I heard it; I was all A vapor, when 'twas told me: and I long'd To vent it any where. 'Twas such a secret, I thought, it would haue burnt me vp. Cic. Good Fvlvia, Feare not your act; and lesse repent you of it. Fvl. I doe not, my good lord. I know to whom I haue vtter'd it. Cic. You haue discharg'd it, safely. Should Rome, for whom you haue done the happy seruice, Turne most ingrate; yet were your vertue paid In conscience of the fact: so much good deedes Reward themselues. Fvl. My lord, I did it not To any other aime, but for it selfe. To no ambition. Cic. You haue learn'd the difference Of doing office to the publike weale, And priuate friendship: and haue shewne it, lady. Be still your selfe. I haue sent for Qvintvs Cvrivs, And (for your vertuous sake) if I can winne him, Yet, to the common-wealth; he shall be safe too. Fvl. Ile vnder-take, my lord, he shall be won. Cic. Pray you, ioyne with me, then: and helpe to worke him. Cicero , Lictor, Fvlvia, Cvrivs. How now? Is he come? Lic. He is here, my lord. Cic. Go presently, Pray my colleague Antonivs, I may speake with him, About some present businesse of the state; And (as you goe) call on my brother Qvintvs, And pray him, with the Tribunes to come to me. Bid Cvrivs enter. Fvlvia, you will aide me? Fvl. It is my dutie. Cic. O, my noble lord! I haue to chide you, yfaith. Giue me your hand. Nay, be not troubled; 't shall be gently, Cvrivs. You looke vpon this lady? What! doe you ghesse My businesse, yet? Come, if you frowne, I thunder: Therefore, put on your better lookes, and thoughts. There's nought but faire, and good intended to you; And I would make those your complexion. Would you, of whom the Senate had that hope, As, on my knowledge, it was in their purpose, Next sitting, to restore you: as they ha' done The stupide, and vngratefull Lentvlvs (Excuse me, that I name you thus, together, For, yet, you are not such) would you, I say, A person both of bloud and honor, stock't In a long race of vertuous ancestors, Embarke your selfe for such a hellish action, With parricides, and traytors; men turn'd furies, Out of the wast, and ruine of their fortunes! (For 'tis despaire, that is the mother of madnesse) Such as want (that, which all conspirators, But they, haue first) meere colour for their mischiefe? O, I must blush with you. Come, you shall not labour To extenuate your guilt, but quit it cleane; Bad men excuse their faults, good men will leaue 'hem. He acts the third crime, that defends the first. Here is a lady, that hath got the start, In pietie of vs all; and, for whose vertue, I could almost turne louer, againe: but that Terentia would be iealous. What an honor Hath shee atchieued to her selfe! What voices, Titles, and loud applauses will pursue her, Through euery street! What windores will be fill'd, To shoot eyes at her! What enuy, and griefe in matrons, They are not shee! when this her act shall seeme Worthier a chariot, then if Pompey came, With Asia chain'd! All this is, while shee liues. But dead, her very name will be a statue! Not wrought for time, but rooted in the minds Of all posteritie: when brasse, and marble, I, and the Capitol it selfe is dust! Fvl. Your honor thinks too highly of me. Cic. No: I cannot thinke inough. And I would haue Him emulate you. 'Tis no shame, to follow The better precedent. Shee shewes you, Cvrivs, What claime your countrey layes to you; and what dutie You owe to it: be not afraid, to breake With murderers, and traytors, for the sauing A life, so neere, and necessary to you, As is your countries. Thinke but on her right. No child can be too naturall to his parent. Shee is our common mother, and doth challenge The prime part of vs; doe not stop, but giue it: He, that is void of feare, may soone be iust. And no religion binds men to be traitors. Fvl. My lord, he vnderstands it; and will follow Your sauing counsell: but his shame, yet, stayes him. I know, that he is comming. Cvr. Doe you know it? Fvl. Yes, let me speake with you. Cvr. O you areâ Fvl. What am I? Cvr. Speake not so loud. Fvl. I am, what you should be, Come, doe you thinke, I'ld walke in any plot, Where madame Sempronia should take place of me, And Fvlvia come i' the rere, or o'the by? That I would be her second, in a businesse, Though it might vantage me all the sunne sees? It was a silly phant'sie of yours. Apply Your selfe to me, and the Consul, and be wise; Follow the fortune I ha' put you into: You may be something this way, and with safetie. Cic. Nay, I must tolerate no whisperings, lady. Fvl. Sir, you may heare. I tell him, in the way, Wherein he was, how hazardous his course was. Cic. How hazardous? how certayne to all ruine. Did he, or doe, yet, any of them imagine The gods would sleepe, to such a Stygian practice, Against that common-wealth, which they haue founded With so much labour, and like care haue kept, Now neere seuen hundred yeeres? It is a madnesse, Wherewith heauen blinds 'hem, when it would confound 'hem, That they should thinke it. Come, my Cvrivs, I see your nature's right; you shall no more Be mention'd with them: I will call you mine, And trouble this good shame, no farder. Stand Firme for your countrey; and become a man Honor'd, and lou'd. It were a noble life, To be found dead, embracing her. Know you, What thankes, what titles, what rewards the Senate Will heape vpon you, certaine, for your seruice? Let not a desperate action more engage you, Then safetie should: and wicked friendship force What honestie, and vertue cannot worke. Fvl. He tells you right, sweet friend: 'Tis sauing counsaile, Cvr. Most noble Consul, I am yours, and hers; I meane my countries: you' haue form'd me new. Inspiring me, with what I should be, truely. And I intreat, my faith may not seeme cheaper For springing out of penitence. Cic. Good Cvrivs, It shall be dearer rather, and because Il'd make it such, heare, how I trust you more. Keepe still your former face: and mixe againe With these lost spirits. Runne all their mazes with 'hem: For such are treasons. Find their windings out, And subtle turnings, watch their snaky wayes, Through brakes, and hedges, into woods of darkenesse, Where they are faine to creepe vpon their brests In paths ne're trod by men, but wolues, and panthers. Learne, beside Catiline, Lentvlvs, and those, Whose names I haue; what new ones they draw in; Who else are likely; what those great ones are, They doe not name; what wayes they meane to take; And whither their hopes point: to warre, or ruine, By some surprize. Explore all their intents, And what you finde may profit the republique, Acquaint me with it, either, by your selfe, Or this your vertuous friend, on whom I lay The care of vrging you. Ile see, that Rome Shall proue a thankeful, and a bounteous mother: Be secret as the night. Cvr. And constant, sir. Cic. I doe not doubt it. Though the time cut off All vowes. The dignitie of truth is lost, With much protesting. Who is there! This way, Lest you be seene, and met. And when you come, He whispers with him. Be this your token, to this fellow. Light 'hem. O Rome, in what a sicknesse art thou fall'n! How dangerous, and deadly! when thy head Is drown'd in sleepe, and all thy body feu'ry! No noise, no pulling, no vexation wakes thee, Thy lethargie is such: or if, by chance, Thou heau'st thy eye-lids vp, thou dost forget Sooner, then thou wert told, thy proper danger. I did vn-reuerendly, to blame the gods, Who wake for thee, though thou snore to thy selfe. Is it not strange, thou should'st be so diseas'd, And so secure? But more, that the first symptomes Of such a maladie, should not rise out From any worthy member, but a base And common strumpet, worthlesse to be nam'd A haire, or part of thee? Thinke, thinke, hereafter, What thy needes were, when thou must vse such meanes: And lay it to thy brest, how much the gods Vpbraid thy foule neglect of them; by making So vile a thing, the author of thy safetie. They could haue wrought by nobler wayes: haue strooke Thy foes with forked lightning; or ramm'd thunder; Throwne hills vpon 'hem, in the act; haue sent Death, like a dampe, to all their families; Or caus'd their consciences to burst 'hem. But, When they will shew thee what thou art, and make A scornefull difference 'twixt their power, and thee, They helpe thee by such aides, as geese, and harlots. How now? What answer? Is he come? Lic. Your brother, Will streight be here; and your colleague Antonivs Said, coldly, he would follow me. Cic. I, that Troubles me somewhat, and is worth my feare. He is a man, 'gainst whom I must prouide, That (as hee'll doe no good) he doe no harme. He, though he be not of the plot, will like it, And wish it should proceed: for, vnto men, Prest with their wants, all change is euer welcome. I must with offices, and patience win him; Make him, by art, that which he is not borne, A friend vnto the publique; and bestow The prouince on him; which is by the Senate Decreed to me: that benefit will bind him. 'Tis well, if some men will doe well, for price: So few are vertuous, when the reward's away. Nor must I be vnmindfull of my priuate; For which I haue call'd my brother, and the tribunes, My kins-folke, and my clients to be neere me: He that stands vp 'gainst traytors, and their ends, Shall need a double guard, of law, and friends: Especially, in such an enuious state, That sooner will accuse the magistrate, Then the delinquent; and will rather grieue The treason is not acted, then beleeue. CÃ¦sar , Catiline. The night growes on; and you are for your meeting: Ile therefore end in few. Be resolute, And put your enterprise in act: the more Actions of depth, and danger are consider'd, The lesse assuredly they are perform'd. And thence it hapneth, that the brauest plots (Not executed straight) haue beene discouer'd. Say, you are constant, or another, a third, Or more; there may be yet one wretched spirit, With whom the feare of punishment shall worke 'Boue all the thoughts of honor, and reuenge. You are not, now, to thinke what's best to doe, As in beginnings; but, what must be done, Being thus entred: and slip no aduantage That may secure you. Let 'hem call it mischiefe; When it is past, and prosper'd, 'twill be vertue. Th'are petty crimes are punish'd, great rewarded. Nor must you thinke of perill; since, attempts, Begunne with danger, still doe end with glory: And, when need spurres, despaire will be call'd wisdome. Lesse ought the care of men, or fame to fright you; For they, that win, doe seldome receiue shame Of victorie: how ere it be atchiu'd; And vengeance, least. For who, besieg'd with wants, Would stop at death, or any thing beyond it? Come, there was neuer any great thing, yet, Aspired, but by violence, or fraud: And he that sticks (for folly of a conscience) To reach itâ Cat. Is a good religious foole. Caes. A superstitious slaue, and will die beast. Good night. You know what Crassvs thinkes, and I, By this: Prepare you wings, as large as sayles, To cut through ayre, and leaue no print behind you. A serpent, ere he comes to be a dragon, Do's eate a bat: and so must you a Consul, That watches. What you doe, doe quickly Sergivs. You shall not stir for me. Cat. Excuse me, lights there. Caes. By no meanes. Cat. Stay then. All good thoughts to Caesar, And like to Crassvs. Caes. Mind but your friends counsells. Catiline , Avrelia, Lecca. Or, I will beare no mind. How now, Avrelia? Are your confederates come? the ladies? Avr. Yes. Cat. And is Sempronia there? Avr. She is. Cat. That's well. Shee ha's a sulphurous spirit, and will take Light at a sparke. Breake with them, gentle loue, About the drawing as many of their husbands, Into the plot, as can: if not, to rid 'hem. That'll be the easier practice, vnto some, Who haue beene tir'd with 'hem long. Sollicite Their aydes, for money: and their seruants helpe, In firing of the citie, at the time Shall be design'd. Promise 'hem states, and empires, And men, for louers, made of better clay, Then euer the old potter Titan knew. Who's that? O, Porcivs Lecca! are they met? Lec. They are all, here. Cat. Loue, you haue your instructions: Ile trust you with the stuffe you haue to worke on. You'll forme it? Porcivs, fetch the siluer eagle I ga' you in charge. And pray 'hem, they will enter. Catiline , Cethegvs, Cvrivs, Lentvlvs, Vargvnteivs, Longinvs, Gabinivs, Ceparivs, Avtronivs, &amp;c. O, friends, your faces glad me. This will be Our last, I hope, of consultation. Cet. So, it had need. Cvr. We loose occasion, daily. Cat. I, and our meanes: whereof one wounds me most, That was the fairest. Piso is dead, in Spaine. Cet. As we are, here. Lon. And, as it is thought, by enuy Of Pompey's followers. Len. He too's comming backe, Now, out of Asia. Cat. Therefore, what we intend, We must be swift in. Take your seates, and heare. I haue, already, sent Septimivs Into the Picene territorie; and Ivlivs, To raise force, for vs, in Apulia: Manlivs at FesulÃ¦, is (by this time) vp, With the old needie troops, that follow'd Sylla: And all doe but expect, when we will giue The blow at home. Behold this siluer eagle, 'Twas Marivs standard, in the Cimbrian warre, Fatall to Rome; and, as our augures tell me, Shall still be so: for which one ominous cause, I'haue kept it safe, and done it sacred rites, As to a god-head, in a chappell built Of purpose to it. Pledge then all your hands, To follow it, with vowes of death, and ruine, Strooke silently, and home. So waters speake When they runne deepest. Now's the time, this yeere, The twenti'th, from the firing of the Capitol, As fatall too, to Rome, by all predictions: And, in which, honor'd Lentvlvs must rise A king, if he pursue it. Cvr. If he doe not, He is not worthy the great destinie. Len. It is too great for me, but what the gods, And their great loues decree me, I must not Seeme carelesse of. Cat. No, nor we enuious. We haue enough beside, all Gallia, Belgia, Greece, Spaine, and Africke. Cvr. I, and Asia too, Now Pompey is returning. Cat. Noblest Romanes, Me thinkes our lookes, are not so quicke and high, As they were wont. Cvr. No? whose is not? Cat. We haue No anger in our eyes, no storme, no lightning: Our hate is spent, and fum'd away in vapor, Before our hands be at worke. I can accuse Not any one, but all of slacknesse. Cet. Yes, And be your selfe such while you doe it. Cat. Ha? 'Tis sharply answer'd, Caivs. Cet. Truly, truly. Len. Come, let vs each one know his part to doe, And then be accus'd. Leaue these vntimely quarrells. Cvr. I would there were more Romes then one, to ruine. Cet. More Romes? More worlds. Cvr. Nay, then, more gods, and natures, If they tooke part. Len. When shall the time be, first? Cat. I thinke the Saturnalls. Cet. 'Twill be too long. Cat. They are not now farre off, 'tis not a month. Cet. A weeke, a day, an houre is too farre off, Now, were the fittest time. Cat. We ha' not laid All things so safe, and readie. Cet. While we'are laying, We shall all lye; and grow to earth. Would I Were nothing in it, if not now. These things They should be done, e're thought. Cat. Nay, now your reason Forsakes you, Caivs. Thinke, but what commodity That time will minister; the cities custome Of being, then, in mirth, and feastâ Len. Loos'd whole In pleasure and securitieâ Avt. Each house Resolu'd in freedomeâ Cvr. Euery slaue a masterâ Lon. And they too no meane aidesâ Cvr. Made from their hope Of libertieâ Len. Or hate vnto their lords. Var. 'Tis sure, there cannot be a time found out More apt, and naturall. Len. Nay, good Cethegvs, Why doe your passions, now, disturbe our hopes? Cet. Why doe your hopes delude your certainties? Cat. You must lend him his way. Thinke, for the order, And processe of it. Lon. Yes. Len. I like not fire: 'Twill too much wast my citie. Cat. Were it embers, There will be wealth enough, rak't out of them, To spring a new. It must be fire, or nothing. Lon. What else should fright, or terrifie 'hem? Var. True. In that confusion, must be the chiefe slaughter. Cvr. Then we shall kill 'hem brauest. Cep. And in heaps. Avt. Strew sacrifices. Cvr. Make the earth an altar. Lon. And Rome the fire. Lec. 'Twill be a noble night. Var. And worth all Sylla's dayes. Cvr. When husbands, wiues, Grandsires, and nephewes, seruants, and their lords, Virgins, and priests, the infant, and the nurse Goe all to hell, together, in a fleet. Cat. I would haue you, Longinvs, and Statilivs, To take the charge o' the firing, which must be, At a signe giuen with a trumpet, done In twelue chiefe places of the citie, at once. The flaxe, and sulphure, are alreadie laid In, at Cethegvs house. So are the weapons. Gabinivs, you, with other force, shall stop The pipes, and conduits: and kill those that come For water. Cvr. What shall I doe? Cat. All will haue Employment, feare not: Ply the execution. Cvr. For that, trust me, and Cethegvs. Cat. I will be At hand, with the armie, to meet those that scape. And Lentvlvs, begirt you Pompey's house, To seize his sonnes aliue: for they are they Must make our peace with him. All else cut off, As Tarqvine did the poppy heads; or mowers A field of thistles; or else, vp, as ploughes Doe barren lands; and strike together flints, And clods; th'vngratefull Senate, and the people: Till no rage, gone before, or comming after, May weigh with yours, though horror leapt her selfe Into the scale; but, in your violent acts, The fall of torrents, and the noyse of tempests, The boyling of Charybdis, the seas wildnesse, The eating force of flames, and wings of winds, Be all out-wrought, by your transcendent furies. It had beene done, e're this, had I beene Consul; We had had no stop, no let. Len. How find you Antonivs? Cat. The'other ha's wonne him, lost: that Cicero Was borne to be my opposition, And stands in all our wayes. Cvr. Remoue him first. Cet. May that, yet, be done sooner? Cat. Would it were done. Cvr., Var. I'll do't. Cet. It is my prouince; none vsurpe it. Len. What are your meanes? Cet. Enquire not. He shall die. Shall, was too slowly said. He is dying. That Is, yet, too slow. He is dead. Cat. Braue, only Romane, Whose soule might be the worlds soule, were that dying; Refuse not, yet, the aides of these your friends. Len. Here's Vargvnteivs holds good quarter with him. Cat. And vnder the pretext of clientele, And visitation, with the morning haile, Will be admitted. Cet. What is that to me? Var. Yes, we may kill him in his bed, and safely. Cet. Safe is your way, then; take it. Mine's mine owne. Cat. Follow him, Vargvnteivs, and perswade, The morning is the fittest time. Lon. The night Will turne all into tumult. Len. And perhaps Misse of him too. Cat. Intreat, and coniure him, In all our namesâ Len. By all our vowes, and friendships. To them. Sempronia , Avrelia, Fvlvia. What! is our counsell broke vp first? Avr. You say, Women are greatest talkers. Sem. We ha' done; And are now fit for act on. Lon. Which is passion. There's your best actiuitie, lady. Sem. How Knowes your wise fatnesse that? Lon. Your mothers daughter Did teach me, madame. Cet. Come Sempronia, leaue him: He is a giber. And our present businesse Is of more serious consequence. Avrelia Tells me, you haue done most masculinely within, And plaid the orator. Sem. But we must hasten To our designe as well, and execute: Not hang still, in the feuer of an accident. Cat. You say well, lady. Sem. I doe like our plot Exceeding well, 'tis sure; and we shall leaue Little to fortune, in it. Cat. Your banquet stayes. Avrelia, take her in. Where's Fvlvia? Sem. O, the two louers are coupling. Cvr. In good faith, Shee's very ill, with sitting vp. Sem. Youl'd haue her Laugh, and lye downe? Fvl. No, faith, Sempronia, I am not well: I'le take my leaue, it drawes Toward the morning. Cvrivs shall stay with you. Madame, I pray you, pardon me, my health I must respect. Avr. Fare-well, good Fvlvia. Cvr. Make hast, and bid him get his guards about him. Curius whispers this to Fuluia. For Vargvnteivs, and Cornelivs Haue vndertane it, should Cethegvs misse: Their reason, that they thinke his open rashnesse Will suffer easier discouerie, Then their attempt, so vayled vnder friendship. Ile bring you to your coach. Tell him, beside, Of Caesars comming forth, here. Cat. My sweet madame, Will you be gone? Fvl. I am, my lord, in truth, In some indisposition. Cat. I doe wish You had all your health, sweet lady: Lentvlvs, You'll doe her seruice. Len. To her coach, and dutie. Catiline. What ministers men must, for practice, vse! The rash, th'ambitious, needy, desperate, Foolish, and wretched, eu'n the dregs of mankind, To whores, and women! still, it must be so. Each haue their proper place; and, in their roomes, They are the best. Groomes fittest kindle fires, Slaues carry burdens, butchers are for slaughters, Apothecaries, butlers, cookes for poysons; As these for me: dull, stupide Lentvlvs, My stale, with whom I stalke; the rash Cethegvs, My executioner; and fat Longinvs, Statilivs, Cvrivs, Ceparivs, Cimber, My labourers, pioners, and incendiaries; With these domesticke traytors, bosome theeues, Whom custome hath call'd wiues; the readiest helps, To betray headie husbands; rob the easie: And lend the moneys, on returnes of lust. Shall Catiline not doe, now, with these aides, So sought, so sorted, something shall be call'd Their labour, but his profit? and make Caesar Repent his ventring counsells, to a spirit, So much his lord in mischiefe? when all these, Shall, like the brethren sprung of dragons teeth, Ruine each other; and he fall amongst 'hem: With Crassvs, Pompey, or who else appeares, But like, or neere a great one. May my braine Resolue to water, and my bloud turne phlegme, My hands drop off, vnworthy of my sword, And that b'inspired, of it selfe, to rip My brest, for my lost entraills; when I leaue A soule, that will not serue: and who will, are The same with slaues, such clay I dare not feare. The cruelty, I meane to act, I wish Should be call'd mine, and tarry in my name; Whil'st, after-ages doe toile out themselues, In thinking for the like, but doe it lesse: And, were the power of all the fiends let loose, With fate to boot, it should be, still, example. When, what the Gaule, or Moore could not effect, Nor emulous Carthage, with their length of spight, Shall be the worke of one, and that my night. Cicero , Fvlvia, Qvintvs. I Thanke your vigilance. Where's my brother, Qvintvs? Call all my seruants vp. Tell noble Cvrivs, And say it to your selfe, you are my sauers; But that's too little for you, you are Romes: What could I then, hope lesse? O brother! now, The engines I told you of, are working; The machine 'gin's to moue. Where are your weapons? Arme all my house-hold presently. And charge The porter, he let no man in, till day. Qvi. Not clients, and your friends? Cic. They weare those names, That come to murther me. Yet send for Cato, And Qvintvs Catvlvs; those I dare trust: And Flaccvs, and Pomtinivs, the PrÃ¦tors, By the backe way. Qvi. Take care, good brother Marcvs, Your feares be not form'd greater, then they should; And make your friends grieue, while your enemies laugh. Cic. 'Tis brothers counsell, and worth thankes. But doe As I intreat you. I prouide, not feare. Was Caesar there, say you? Fvl. Cvrivs sayes, he met him, Comming from thence. Cic. O, so. And, had you a counsell Of ladies too? Who was your speaker, madame? Fvl. Shee that would be, had there beene fortie more; Sempronia, who had both her greeke, and figures; And, euer and anone, would aske vs, if The witty Consul could haue mended that? Or Orator Cicero could haue said it better? Cic. Shee's my gentle enemy. Would Cethegvs Had no more danger in him. But, my guards Are you, great powers; and th'vnbated strengths Of a firme conscience, which shall arme each step Tane for the state: and teach me slacke no pace For feare of malice. How now, brother? Qvi. Cato, And Qvintvs, Catvivs were comming to you, And Crassvs with 'hem. I haue let 'hem in, By th'garden. Cic. What would Crassvs haue? Qvi. I heare Some whispering 'bout the gate; and making doubt, Whether it be not yet too early, or no? But I doe thinke, they are your friends, and clients, Are fearefull to disturbe you. Cic. You will change To 'another thought, anone. Ha' you giu'n the porter The charge, I will'd you? Qvi. Yes. Cic. With-draw, and hearken. Vargvnteivs , Cornelivs, Porter, Cicero, Cato, Catvlvs, Crassvs. The dore's not open, yet. Cor. You'were best to knocke. Var. Let them stand close, then: And, when we are in, Rush after vs. Cor. But where's Cethegvs? Var. He Has left it, since he might not do't his way. Por. Who's there? Var. A friend, or more. Por. I may not let Any man in, till day. Var. No? why? Cor. Thy reason? Por. I am commanded so. Var. By whom? Cor. I hope We are not discouer'd. Var. Yes, by reuelation. Pray thee, good slaue, who has commanded thee? Por. He that may best, the Consul. Var. We are his friends. Por. All's one. Cor. Best giue your name. Var. Do'st thou heare, fellow? I haue some instant businesse with the Consul. My name is Vargvnteivs. Cic. True, he knowes it; Cicero speakes to them from aboue. And for what friendly office you are sent. Cornelivs, too, is there? Var. We are betraid. Cic. And desperate Cethegvs, is he not? Var. Speake you, he knowes my voyce. Cic. What say you to't? Cor. You are deceiu'd, sir. Cic. No, 'tis you are so; Poore, misse-led men. Your states are yet worth pitty, If you would heare, and change your sauage minds. Leaue to be mad; forsake your purposes Of treason, rapine, murder, fire, and horror: The common-wealth hath eyes, that wake as sharpely Ouer her life, as yours doe for her ruine. Be not deceiu'd, to thinke her lenitie Will be perpetuall; or, if men be wanting, The gods will be, to such a calling cause. Consider your attempts, and while there's time, Repent you of 'hem. It doth make me tremble There should those spirits yet breath, that when they cannot Liue honestly, would rather perish basely. Cato. You talke too much to 'hem, Marcvs, they' are lost. Goe forth, and apprehend 'hem. Catv. If you proue This practice, what should let the common-wealth To take due vengeance? Var. Let vs shift, away. The darkenesse hath conceal'd vs, yet. Wee'll say Some haue abus'd our names. Cor. Deny it all. Cato. Qvintvs, what guards ha' you? Call the Tribunes aide, And raise the citie. Consul, you are too mild, The foulenesse of some facts takes thence all mercy: Report it to the Senate. Heare: The gods Jt thunders, and lightens violently on the sodaine. Grow angrie with your patience. 'Tis their care, And must be yours, that guiltie men escape not. As crimes doe grow, iustice should rouse it selfe. Chorvs. What is it, heauens, you prepare With so much swiftnesse, and so sodaine rising? There are no sonnes of earth, that dare, Againe, rebellion? or the gods surprising? The world doth shake, and nature feares, Yet is the tumult, and the horror greater Within our minds, then in our eares: So much Romes faults (now growne her fate) doe threat her. The priests, and people runne about, Each order, age, and sexe amaz'd at other; And, at the ports, all thronging out, As if their safety were to quit their mother: Yet finde they the same dangers there, From which they make such hast to be preserued; For guiltie states doe euer beare The plagues about them, which they haue deserued. And, till those plagues doe get aboue The mountayne of our faults, and there doe sit; We see 'hem not. Thus, still we loue The'euill we doe, vntill we suffer it. But, most, ambition, that neere vice To vertue, hath the fate of Rome prouoked; And made, that now Rome's selfe no price, To free her from the death, wherewith shee's yoked. That restlesse ill, that still doth build Vpon successe; and ends not in aspiring: But there begins. And ne're is fill'd, While ought remaines that seemes but worth desiring. Wherein the thought, vnlike the eye, To which things farre, seeme smaller then they are, Deemes all contentment plac'd on high: And thinkes there's nothing great, but what is farre. O, that in time, Rome did not cast Her errors vp, this fortune to preuent; T'haue seene her crimes 'ere they were past: And felt her faults, before her punishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IIII. Diuers Senators passe by, quaking, and trembling. Allobroges. Can these men feare? who are not onely yours, But the worlds masters? Then I see, the gods Vpbraid our suffrings, or would humble them; By sending these affrights, while we are here: That we might laugh at their ridiculous feare, Whose names, we trembled at, beyond the Alpes. Of all that passe, I doe not see a face Worthy a man; that dares looke vp, and stand One thunder out: but downe-ward all, like beasts, Running away from euery flash is made. The falling world could not deserue such basenesse. Are we emploid here, by our miseries, Like superstitious fooles (or rather slaues) To plaine our griefs, wrongs, and oppressions, To a meere clothed Senate, whom our folly Hath made, and still intends to keepe our tyrannes? It is our base petitionarie breath That blowes 'hem to this greatnesse; which this pricke Would soone let out, if we were bold, and wretched. When they haue taken all we haue, our goods, Crop, lands, and houses, they will leaue vs this: A weapon, and an arme will still be found, Though naked left, and lower then the ground. Cato , Catvlvs, Cicero, Allobroges. Doe; vrge thine anger, still: good heauen, and iust. Tell guiltie men, what powers are aboue them. In such a confidence of wickednesse, 'Twas time, they should know something fit to feare. Catv. I neuer saw a morne more full of horror. Cato. To Catiline, and his: But, to iust men, Though heauen should speake, with all his wrath at once, That, with his breath, the hinges of the world Did cracke, we should stand vpright, and vnfear'd. Cic. Why, so we doe, good Cato. Who be these? Catv. Ambassadors, from the Allobroges, I take 'hem, by their habits. All. I, these men Seeme of another race; let's sue to these, There's hope of iustice, with their fortitude. Cic. Friends of the Senate, and of Rome, to day We pray you to forbeare vs: on the morrow What sute you haue, let vs, by Fabivs Sanga, (Whose patronage your state doth vse) but know it, And, on the Consul's word, you shall receiue Dispatch, or else an answere, worth your patience. All. We could not hope for more, most worthy Consul. This magistrate hath strooke an awe into me, And, by his sweetnesse, wonne a more reguard Vnto his place, then all the boystrous moodes That ignorant greatnesse practiseth, to fill The large, vnfit authoritie it weares. How easie is a noble spirit discern'd From harsh, and sulphurous matter, that flies out In contumelies, makes a noyse, and stinkes! May we find good, and great men: that know how To stoupe to wants, and meete necessities, And will not turne from any equall suites. Such men, they doe not succour more the cause, They vnder-take, with fauour, and successe; Then, by it, their owne iudgements they doe raise, In turning iust mens needs, into their praise. The Senate. Prae. Roome for the Consuls. Fathers, take your places. Here, in the house of Ivpiter, the Stayer, By edict from the Consul, Marcvs Tvllivs. You'are met, a frequent Senate. Heare him speake. Cic. What may be happy, and auspicious still To Rome, and hers. Honor'd, and conscript Fathers, If I were silent, and that all the dangers Threatning the state, and you, were yet so hid In night, or darkenesse thicker in their brests, That are the blacke contriuers; so, that no Beame of the light could pierce 'hem: yet the voyce Of heau'n, this morning, hath spoke loud inough, T'instruct you with a feeling of the horror; And wake you from a sleepe, as starke, as death. I haue, of late, spoke often in this Senate, Touching this argument, but still haue wanted Either your eares, or faith: so' incredible Their plots haue seem'd, or I so vaine, to make These things for mine owne glorie, and false greatnesse, As hath beene giuen out. But be it so. When they breake forth, and shall declare themselues, By their too foule effects, then, then, the enuy Of my iust cares will find another name. For me, I am but one: and this poore life, So lately aim'd at, not an houre yet since, They cannot with more eagernesse pursue, Then I with gladnesse would lay downe, and loose, To buy Romes peace, if that would purchase it. But when I see, they'ld make it but the step To more, and greater; vnto yours, Romes, all: I would with those preserue it, or then fall. Caes. I, I, let you alone, cunning artificer! See, how his gorget'peeres aboue his gowne; To tell the people, in what danger he was. It was absurdly done of Vargvnteivs, To name himselfe, before he was got in. Cra. It matters not, so they denie it all: And can but carry the lye constantly. Will Catiline be here? Caes. I'haue sent for him. Cra. And ha' you bid him to be confident? Caes. To that his owne necessitie will prompt him. Cra. Seeme to beleeue nothing at all, that Cicero Relates vs. Caes. It will mad him. Cra. O, and helpe The other partie. Who is that? his brother? What new intelligence ha's he brought him now? Quintus Cicero brings in the Tribunes, and guards. Caes. Some cautions from his wife, how to behaue him. Cic. Place some of them without, and some bring in. Thanke their kind loues. It is a comfort yet, That all depart not from their countries cause. Caes. How now, what meanes this muster? Consul, Antonivs? Ant. I doe not know, aske my colleague, hee'll tell you. There is some reason in state, that I must yeeld to; And I haue promis'd him: Indeed he has bought it, With giuing me the Prouince. Cic. I professe, It grieues me, Fathers, that I am compell'd To draw these armes, and aides for your defence; And, more, against a citizen of Rome, Borne here amongst you, a Patrician, A man, I must confesse, of no meane house, Nor no small vertue, if he had employ'd Those excellent gifts of fortune, and of nature, Vnto the good, not ruine of the state. But, being bred in's fathers needy fortunes, Brought vp in's sisters prostitution, Confirm'd in ciuill slaughter, entring first The common-wealth, with murder of the gentrie; Since, both by studie, and custome, conuersant With all licentiousnesse: what could be hop'd In such a field of riot, but a course Extreme pernicious? Though, I must protest, I found his mischiefs, sooner, with mine eyes, Then with my thought; and with these hands of mine, Before they touch'd, at my suspicion. Caes. What are his mischiefs, Consul? you declame Against his manners, and corrupt your owne: No wise man should, for hate of guiltie men, Loose his owne innocence. Cic. The noble Caesar Speakes god-like truth. But, when he heares, I can Conuince him, by his manners, of his mischiefs, He might be silent: and not cast away His sentences in vaine, where they scarce looke Toward his subiect. Cato. Here he comes himselfe. Catiline sits downe, and Cato rises, from him. If he be worthy any good mans voyce, That good man sit downe by him: Cato will not. Catv. If Cato leaue him, I'le not keepe aside. Cati. What face is this, the Senate here puts on, Against me, Fathers! Giue my modestie Leaue, to demand the cause of so much strangenesse. Caes. It is reported here, you are the head To a strange faction, Lvcivs. Cic. I, and will Be prou'd against him. Cati. Let it be. Why, Consul, If in the common-wealth, there be two bodies, One leane, weake, rotten, and that hath a head; The other strong, and healthfull, but hath none: If I doe giue it one, doe I offend? Restore your selues, vnto your temper, Fathers; And, without perturbation, heare me speake. Remember who I am, and of what place, What petty fellow this is, that opposes; One, that hath exercis'd his eloquence, Still to the bane of the nobilitie: A boasting, insolent tongue-man. Cato. Peace, leud traytor. Or wash thy mouth. He is an honest man And loues his countrey, would thou didst so, too. Cati. Cato, you are too zealous for him. Cato. No; Thou art too impudent. Catv. Catiline, be silent. Cati. Nay then, I easily feare, my iust defence Will come too late, to so much preiudice. Caes. (Will he sit downe?) Cati. Yet, let the world forsake me, My innocence must not. Cato. Thou innocent? So are the Furies. Cic. Yes, and Ate, too. Do'st thou not blush, pernicious Catiline? Or, hath the palenesse of thy guilt drunke vp Thy bloud, and drawne thy veines, as drie of that, As is thy heart of truth, thy brest of vertue? Whither at length wilt thou abuse our patience? Still shall thy furie mocke vs? To what licence Dares thy vnbridled boldnesse runne it selfe? Doe all the nightly guards, kept on the palace, The cities watches, with the peoples feares, The concourse of all good men, this so strong And fortified seate here of the Senate, The present lookes vpon thee, strike thee nothing? Do'st thou not feele thy counsells all laid open? And see thy wild conspiracie bound in With each mans knowledge? which of all this order Canst thou thinke ignorant (if they'll but vtter Their conscience to the right) of what thou didst Last night, what on the former, where thou wert, Whom thou didst call together, what your plots were? O age, and manners! This the Consul sees, The Senate vnderstands, yet this man liues! Liues? I, and comes here into counsell with vs; Partakes the publique cares: and with his eye Markes, and points out each man of vs to slaughter. And we, good men, doe satisfie the state, If we can shunne but this mans sword, and madnesse. There was that vertue, once, in Rome, when good men Would, with more sharpe co?rcion, haue restrain'd A wicked citizen, then the deadliest foe. We haue that law still, Catiline, for thee; An act as graue, as sharpe: The state's not wanting, Nor the authoritie of this Senate; we, We, that are Consuls, onely faile our selues. This twentie dayes, the edge of that decree We haue let dull, and rust; kept it shut vp, As in a sheath, which drawne should take thy head. Yet still thou liu'st: and liu'st not to lay by Thy wicked confidence, but to confirme it. I could desire, Fathers, to be found Still mercifull, to seeme, in these maine perills Grasping the state, a man remisse, and slacke; But then, I should condemne my selfe of sloth, And trecherie. Their campe's in Italie, Pitch'd in the iawes, here, of Hetruria; Their numbers daily increasing, and their generall Within our walls: nay, in our counsell! plotting Hourely some fatall mischiefe to the publique. If, Catiline, I should command thee, now, Here, to be taken, kill'd; I make iust doubt, Whether all good men would not thinke it done Rather too late, then any man too cruell. Cato. Except he were of the same meale, and batch. Cic. But that, which ought to haue been done long since, I will, and (for good reason) yet forbeare. Then will I take thee, when no man is found So lost, so wicked, nay, so like thy selfe, But shall professe, 'tis done of need, and right. While there is one, that dares defend thee, liue; Thou shalt haue leaue; but so, as now thou liu'st: Watch'd at a hand, besieged, and opprest From working least commotion to the state. I haue those eyes, and eares, shall still keepe guard, And spiall on thee, as they haue euer done, And thou not feele it. What, then, canst thou hope? If neither night can, with her darknesse, hide Thy wicked meetings; nor a priuate house Can, in her walls, contayne the guiltie whispers Of thy conspiracie: if all breake out, All be discouered, change thy mind at last, And loose thy thoughts of ruine, flame, and slaughter. Remember, how I told, here, to the Senate, That such a day, thy Lictor, Caivs Manlivs, Would be in armes. Was I deceiued, Catiline? Or in the fact, or in the time? the houre? I told too, in this Senate, that thy purpose Was, on the fifth (the kalends of Nouember) T'haue slaughter'd this whole order: which my caution Made many leaue the citie. Canst thou here Denie, but this thy blacke designe was hindred, That very day, by me? thy selfe clos'd in Within my strengths, so that thou could'st not moue Against a publique reed? when thou wert heard To say, vpon the parting of the rest, Thou would'st content thee, with the murder of vs, That did remaine. Had'st thou not hope, beside, By a surprize, by night, to take PrÃ¦neste? Where when thou cam'st, did'st thou not find the place Made good against thee, with my aides, my watches? My garrisons fortified it. Thou do'st nothing, Sergivs, Thou canst endeauour nothing, nay not thinke, But I both see, and heare it; and am with thee, By, and before, about, and in thee, too. Call but to mind thy last nights businesse. Come, Ile vse no circumstance: at Lecca's house, The shop, and mint of your conspiracie, Among your sword-men, where so many associates Both of thy mischiefe, and thy madnesse, met. Dar'st thou denie this? wherefore art thou silent? Speake, and this shall conuince thee: Here they are, I see 'hem, in this Senate, that were with thee. O, you immortall gods! in what clime are we? What region doe we liue in? in what ayre? What common-wealth, or state is this we haue? Here, here, amongst vs, our owne number, Fathers, In this most holy counsell of the world, They are, that seeke the spoyle of me, of you, Of ours, of all; what I can name's too narrow: Follow the sunne, and find not their ambition. These I behold, being Consul; nay, I aske Their counsells of the state, as from good Patriots: Whom it were fit the axe should hew in pieces, I not so much as wound, yet, with my voyce. Thou wast, last night, with Lecca, Catiline, Your shares, of Italie, you there diuided; Appointed who, and whither, each should goe; What men should stay behind, in Rome, were chosen; Your offices set downe; the parts mark'd out, And places of the citie, for the fire; Thy selfe (thou'affirmd'st) wast readie to depart, Onely, a little let there was, that stay'd thee, That I yet liu'd. Vpon the word, stept forth Three of thy crew, to rid thee of that care; Two vnder-tooke this morning, before day, To kill me in my bed. All this I knew, Your conuent scarce dismiss'd, arm'd all my seruants, Call'd both my brother, and friends, shut out your clients, You sent to visite me; whose names I told To some there, of good place, before they came. Cato. Yes, I, and Qvintvs Catvlvs can affirme it. Caes. He's lost, and gone. His spirits haue forsooke him. Cic. If this be so, why, Catiline, do'st thou stay? Goe, where thou mean'st. The ports are open; forth. The campe abroad wants thee, their chiefe, too long. Lead with thee all thy troupes out. Purge the citie. Draw drie that noysome, and pernicious sinke, Which left, behind thee, would infect the world. Thou wilt free me of all my feares, at once, To see a wall betweene vs. Do'st thou stop To doe that now, commanded; which before, Of thine owne choice, thou'rt prone to? Goe. The Consul Bids thee, an enemie, to depart the citie. Whither, thou'lt aske? to exile? I not bid Thee that. But aske my counsell, I perswade it. What is there, here, in Rome, that can delight thee? Where not a soule, without thine owne foule knot, But feares, and hates thee. What domesticke note Of priuate filthinesse, but is burnt in Into thy life? What close, and secret shame, But is growne one, with thy knowne infamy? What lust was euer absent from thine eyes? What leud fact from thy hands? what wickednesse From thy whole body? where's that youth drawne in Within thy nets, or catch'd vp with thy baits, Before whose rage, thou hast not borne a sword, And to whose lusts thou hast not held a torch? Thy latter nuptialls I let passe in silence; Where sinnes incredible, on sinnes, were heap't: Which I not name, lest, in a ciuill state, So monstrous facts should either appeare to be, Or not to be reueng'd. Thy fortunes, too, I glance not at, which hang but till next Ides. I come to that which is more knowne, more publike; The life, and safetie of vs all, by thee Threatned, and sought. Stood'st thou not in the field, When Lepidvs, and Tvllvs were our Consuls, Vpon the day of choice, arm'd, and with forces, To take their liues, and our chiefe citizens? When, not thy feare, nor conscience chang'd thy mind, But the meere fortune of the common-wealth With-stood thy actiue malice? Speake but right. How often hast thou made attempt on me? How many of thy assaults haue I declin'd With shifting but my body (as wee'ld say) Wrested thy dagger from thy hand, how oft? How often hath it falne, or slip't by chance? Yet, can thy side not want it: which, how vow'd, Or with what rites, 'tis sacred of thee, I know not, That still thou mak'st it a necessitie, To fixe it in the body of a Consul. But let me loose this way, and speake to thee, Not as one mou'd with hatred, which I ought, But pitty, of which none is owing thee. Cat. No more then vnto Tantalvs, or Tityvs. Cic. Thou cam'st, e're-while, into this Senate. Who Of such a frequency, so many friends, And kindred thou hast here, saluted thee? Were not the seates made bare, vpon thy entrance? Riss' not the consular men? and left their places, So soone as thou sat'st downe? and fled thy side, Like to a plague, or ruine? knowing, how oft They had beene, by thee, mark'd out for the shambles? How dost thou beare this? Surely, if my slaues At home fear'd me, with halfe th'affright, and horror, That, here, thy fellow-citizens doe thee, I should soone quit my house, and thinke it need too. Yet thou dar'st tarry here? Goe forth, at last; Condemne thy selfe to flight, and solitude. Discharge the common-wealth, of her deepe feare. Goe; into banishment, if thou wait'st the word. Why do'st thou looke? They all consent vnto it. Do'st thou expect th'authoritie of their voyces, Whose silent wills condemne thee? While they sit, They approue it; while they suffer it, they decree it; And while they'are silent to it, they proclaime it. Proue thou there honest, Ile endure the enuie. But there's no thought, thou should'st be euer he, Whom either shame should call from filthinesse, Terror from danger, or discourse from furie. Goe; I intreat thee: yet, why doe I so? When I alreadie know, they'are sent afore, That tarry for thee'in armes, and doe expect thee On th'Avrelian way. I know the day Set downe, 'twixt thee, and Manlivs; vnto whom The siluer eagle too is sent, before: Which I doe hope shall proue, to thee as banefull, As thou conceiu'st it to the common-wealth. But, may this wise, and sacred Senate say, What mean'st thou Marcvs Tvllivs? If thou know'st That Catiline be look'd for, to be chiefe Of an intestine warre; that he'is the author Of such a wickednesse; the caller out Of men of marke in mischiefe, to an action Of so much horror; Prince of such a treason; Why do'st thou send him forth? why let him scape? This is, to giue him libertie, and power: Rather, thou should'st lay hold vpon him, send him To deseru'd death, and a iust punishment. To these so holy voices, thus I answere. If I did thinke it timely, Conscript Fathers, To punish him with death, I would not giue The Fencer vse of one short houre, to breath; But when there are in this graue order, some, Who, with soft censures, still doe nource his hopes; Some, that with not beleeuing, haue confirm'd His designes more, and whose authoritie The weaker, as the worst men, too, haue follow'd: I would now send him, where they all should see Cleere, as the light, his heart shine; where no man Could be so wickedly, or fondly stupide, But should cry out, he saw, touch'd, felt, and grasp't it. Then, when he hath runne out himselfe; led forth His desp'rate partie with him; blowne together Aides of all kindes, both shipwrack'd mindes and fortunes: Not onely the growne euill, that now is sprung, And sprouted forth, would be pluck'd vp, and weeded; But the stocke, roote, and seed of all the mischiefes, Choking the common-wealth. Where, should we take, Of such a swarme of traytors, onely him, Our cares, and feares might seeme a while relieu'd, But the maine perill would bide still enclos'd Deepe, in the veines, and bowells of the state. As humane bodies, labouring with feuers, While they are tost with heate, if they doe take Cold water, seeme for that short space much eas'd, But afterward, are ten times more afflicted. Wherefore, I say, let all this wicked crew Depart, diuide themselues from good men, gather Their forces to one head; as I said oft, Let 'hem be seuer'd from vs with a wall; Let 'hem leaue off attempts, vpon the Consul, In his owne house; to circle in the PrÃ¦tor; To girt the court with weapons; to prepare Fire, and balls, swords, torches, sulphure, brands: In short, let it be writ in each mans fore-head What thoughts he beares the publike. I here promise, Fathers Conscript, to you, and to my selfe, That diligence in vs Consuls, for my honor'd Colleague, abroad, and for my selfe, at home; So great authoritie in you; so much Vertue, in these, the gentlemen of Rome; Whom I could scarce restraine to day, in zeale, From seeking out the parricide, to slaughter; So much consent in all good men, and minds, As, on the going out of this one Catiline, All shall be cleere, made plaine, oppress'd, reueng'd. And, with this omen, goe, pernicious plague, Out of the citie, to the wish'd destruction Of thee, and those, that, to the ruine of her, Haue tane that bloudie, and black sacrament. Thou Ivpiter, whom we doe call the Stayer, Both of this citie, and this empire, wilt (With the same auspice thou didst raise it first) Driue from thy altars, and all other temples, And buildings of this citie; from our walls; Liues, states, and fortunes of our citizens; This fiend, this furie, with his complices. And all the 'offence of good men (these knowne traytors Vnto their countrey, theeues of Italie, Ioyn'd in so damn'd a league of mischiefe) thou Wilt with perpetuall plagues, aliue, and dead, Punish for Rome, and saue her innocent head. Cati. If an oration, or high language, Fathers, Could make me guiltie, here is one, hath done it: H' has stroue to emulate this mornings thunder, With his prodigious rhetoricke. But I hope, This Senate is more graue, then to giue credit Rashly to all he vomits, 'gainst a man Of your owne order, a Patrician; And one, whose ancestors haue more deseru'd Of Rome, then this mans eloquence could vtter, Turn'd the best way: as still, it is the worst. Cato. His eloquence hath more deseru'd to day, Speaking thy ill, then all thy ancestors Did, in their good: and, that the state will find, Which he hath sau'd. Cati. How, he? were I that enemie, That he would make me: Il'd not wish the state More wretched, then to need his preseruation. What doe you make him, Cato, such a Hercvles? An Atlas? A poore petty in-mate! Cato. Traytor. Cati. He saue the state? A burgesse sonne of Arpinum. The gods would rather twentie Romes should perish, Then haue that contumely stucke vpon 'hem, That he should share with them, in the preseruing A shed, or signe-post. Cato. Peace, thou prodigie. Cati. They would be forc'd themselues, againe, and lost In the first, rude, and indigested heape; Ere such a wretched name, as Cicero, Should sound with theirs. Catv. Away, thou impudent head. Cati. Doe you all backe him? are you silent too? Well, I will leaue you, Fathers; I will goe. He turnes sodainly on Cicero. Butâmy fine daintie speakerâ Cic. What now, Furie? Wilt thou assault me here? Cho. (Helpe, aide the Consul.) Cati. See, Fathers, laugh you not? who threatned him? In vaine thou do'st conceiue, ambitious orator, Hope of so braue a death, as by this hand. Cato. (Out, of the court, with the pernicious traytor.) Cati. There is no title, that this flattering Senate, Nor honor, the base multitude can giue thee, Shall make thee worthy Catilines anger. Cato. (Stop, Stop that portentous mouth.) Cati. Or, when it shall, Ile looke thee dead. Cato. Will none restraine the monster? Catv. Parricide. Qvi. Butcher, traytor, leaue the Senate. Cati. I'am gone, to banishment, to please you, Fathers. Thrust head-long forth? Cato. Still, do'st thou murmure, monster? Cati. Since, I am thus put out, and made aâ Cic. What? Catv. Not guiltier then thou art. Cati. I will not burne Without my funerall pile. Cato. What saies the fiend? Cati. I will haue matter, timber: Cato. Sing out scrich-owle. Cati. It shall be inâ Catv. Speake thy imperfect thoughts. Cati. The common fire, rather then mine owne. For fall I will with all, ere fall alone. Cra. H'is lost, there is no hope of him. Caes. Vnlesse He presently take armes; and giue a blow, Before the Consuls forces can be leui'd. Cic. What is your pleasure, Fathers, shall be done? Catv. See, that the common-wealth receiue no losse. Cato. Commit the care thereof vnto the Consuls. Cra. 'Tis time. Caes. And need. Cic. Thankes to this frequent Senate. But what decree they, vnto Cvrivs, And Fvlvia? Catv. What the Consul shall thinke meete. Cic. They must receiue reward, though 't be not knowne; Lest when a state needs ministers, they ha' none. Cato. Yet, Marcvs Tvllivs, doe not I beleeue, But Crassvs, and this Caesar here ring hollow. Cic. And would appeare so, if that we durst proue 'hem. Cato. Why dare we not? What honest act is that, The Roman Senate should not dare, and doe? Cic. Not an vnprofitable, dangerous act, To stirre too many serpents vp at once. Caesar, and Crassvs, if they be ill men, Are mightie ones; and, we must so prouide, That, while we take one head, from this foule Hydra, There spring not twentie more. Cato. I' proue your counsell. Cic. They shall be watch'd, and look'd too. Till they doe Declare themselues, I will not put 'hem out By any question. There they stand. Ile make My selfe no enemies, nor the state no traytors. Catiline , Lentvlvs, Cethecvs, Cvrivs, Gabinivs, Longinvs, Statilivs. False to our selues? All our designes discouer'd To this state-cat? Cet. I, had I had my way, He' had mew'd in flames, at home, not i'the Senate: I' had sing'd his furres, by this time. Cat. Well, there's, now, No time of calling backe, or standing still. Friends, be your selues; keepe the same Roman hearts, And readie minds, you' had yester-night. Prepare To execute, what we resolu'd. And let not Labour, or danger, or discouerie fright you. Ile to the armie: you (the while) mature Things, here, at home. Draw to you any aides, That you thinke fit, of men of all conditions, Or any fortunes, that may helpe a warre. Ile bleede a life, or winne an empire for you. Within these few dayes, looke to see my ensignes, Here, at the walls: Be you but firme within. Meane time, to draw an enuy on the Consul, And giue a lesse suspicion of our course, Let it be giuen out, here in the citie, That I am gone, an innocent man, to exile, Into Massilia, willing to giue way To fortune, and the times; being vnable To stand so great a faction, without troubling The common-wealth: whose peace I rather seeke, Then all the glory of contention, Or the support of mine owne innocence. Farewell the noble Lentvlvs, Longinvs, Cvrivs, the rest; and thou, my better Genius, The braue Cethegvs: when we meete againe, Wee'll sacrifice to libertie. Cet. And reuenge. That we may praise our hands once. Len. O, you Fates, Giue Fortune now her eyes, to see with whom Shee goes along, that shee may ne're forsake him. Cvr. He needs not her, nor them. Goe but on, Sergivs. A valiant man is his owne fate, and fortune. Lon. The fate, and fortune of vs all goe with him. Gab., Sta. And euer guard him. Cat. I am all your creature. Len. Now friends, 'tis left with vs. I haue alreadie Dealt, by Vmbrenvs, with the Allobroges, Here resiant in Rome; whose state, I heare, Is discontent with the great vsuries, They are oppress'd with: and haue made complaints Diuers, vnto the Senate, but all vaine. These men, I'haue thought (both for their owne oppressions, As also that, by nature, they'are a people Warlike, and fierce, still watching after change, And now, in present hatred with our state) The fittest, and the easiest to be drawne To our societie, and to aide the warre. The rather, for their seate; being next bordrers On Italie; and that they abound with horse: Of which one want our campe doth onely labour. And I haue found 'hem comming. They will meete Soone, at Sempronia's house, where I would pray you All to be present, to confirme 'hem more. The sight of such spirits hurt not, nor the store. Gab. I will not faile. Sta. Nor I. Cvr. Nor I. Cet. Would! Had somewhat by my selfe, apart, to doe. I ha'no Genius to these many counsells. Let me kill all the Senate, for my share, Ile doe it at next sitting. Len. Worthy Caivs, Your presence will adde much. Cet. I shall marre more. Cicero , Sanga, Allobroges. The state's beholden to you, Fabivs Sanga, For this great care: And those Allobroges Are more then wretched, if they lend a listning To such perswasion. San. They, most worthy Consul, As men employ'd here, from a grieued state, Groning beneath a multitude of wrongs, And being told, there was small hope of ease To be expected, to their euills, from hence, Were willing, at the first to giue an eare To any thing, that sounded libertie: But since, on better thoughts, and my vrg'd reasons, They'are come about, and wonne, to the true side. The fortune of the common-wealth hath conquer'd. Cic. What is that same Vmbrenvs, was the agent? San. One that hath had negotiation In Gallia oft, and knowne vnto their state. Cic. Are th'Ambassadors come with you? San. Yes, Cic. Well, bring 'hem in, if they be firme, and honest, Neuer had men the meanes so to deserue Of Rome, as they. A happy, wish'd occasion, And thrust into my hands, for the discouery, And manifest conuiction of these traytors. Be thank'd, Ã Ivpiter. My worthy lords, The Allobroges enter. Confederates of the Senate, you are welcome. I vnderstand by Qvintvs Fabivs Sanga, Your carefull patron here, you haue beene lately Sollicited against the common-wealth, By one Vmbrenvs (take a seate, I pray you) From Pvblivs Lentvlvs, to be associates In their intended warre. I could aduise, That men, whose fortunes are yet flourishing, And are Romes friends, would not, without a cause, Become her enemies; and mixe themselues And their estates, with the lost hopes of Catiline, Or Lentvlvs, whose meere despaire doth arme 'hem: That were to hazard certainties, for aire, And vnder-goe all danger, for a voice. Beleeue me, friends, loud tumults are not laid With halfe the easinesse, that they are rais'd. All may beginne a warre, but few can end it. The Senate haue decreed, that my colleague Shall leade their armie, against Catiline, And haue declar'd both him, and Manlivs traytors. Metellvs Celer hath alreadie giuen Part of their troops defeate. Honors are promis'd To all, will quit 'hem; and rewards propos'd Euen to slaues, that can detect their courses. Here, in the citie, I haue by the PrÃ¦tors, And Tribunes, plac'd my guards, and watches so, That not a foote can treade, a breath can whisper, But I haue knowledge. And be sure, the Senate, And people of Rome, of their accustom'd greatnesse, Will sharply, and seuerely vindicate, Not onely any fact, but any practice, Or purpose, 'gainst the state. Therefore, my lords, Consult of your owne wayes, and thinke which hand Is best to take. You, now, are present suters For some redresse of wrongs; Ile vnder-take Not onely that shall be assur'd you: but What grace, or priuiledge else, Senate, or people, Can cast vpon you, worthy such a seruice, As you haue now the way, and meanes, to doe 'hem, If but your wills consent, with my designes. All. We couet nothing more, most worthy Consul. And how so e're we haue beene tempted lately, To a defection, that not makes vs guiltie: We are not yet so wretched in our fortunes, Nor in our wills so lost, as to abandon A friendship, prodigally, of that price, As is the Senate, and the people of Romes, For hopes, that doe precipitate themselues. Cic. You then are wise, and honest. Doe but this, then: (When shall you speake with Lentvlvs, and the rest? All. We are to meete anone, at Brvtvs house. Cic. Who? Decivs Brvtvs? He is not in Rome. San. O, but his wife Sempronia. Cic. You instruct me, Shee is a chiefe.) Well, faile not you to meete 'hem, And to expresse the best affection You can put on, to all that they intend. Like it, applaud it, giue the common-wealth, And Senate lost to 'hem. Promise any aides By armes, or counsell. What they can desire, I would haue you preuent. Onely, say this, You'haue had dispatch, in priuate, by the Consul, Of your affaires, and for the many feares The state's now in, you are will'd by him, this euening, To depart Rome: which you, by all sought meanes, Will doe, of reason to decline suspicion. Now, for the more authoritie of the businesse They'haue trusted to you, and to giue it credit With your owne state, at home, you would desire Their letters to your Senate, and your people, Which shewne, you durst engage both life, and honor, The rest should euery way answere their hopes. Those had, pretend sodaine departure, you, And, as you giue me notice, at what port You will goe out, Ile ha' you intercepted, And all the letters taken with you: So As you shall be redeem'd in all opinions, And they conuicted of their manifest treason. Ill deedes are well turn'd backe, vpon their authors: And 'gainst an iniurer, the reuenge is iust. This must be done, now. All. Chearefully, and firmely. We'are they, would rather hast to vndertake it, Then stay, to say so. Cic. With that confidence, goe: Make your selues happy, while you make Rome so. By Sanga, let me haue notice from you. All. Yes. Sempronia , Lentvlvs, Cethegvs, Gabinivs, Statilivs, Longinvs, Voltvrtivs, Allobroges. When come these creatures, the Ambassadors? I would faine see 'hem. Are they any schollers? Len. I think not, madame. Sem. Ha'they no greeke? Len. No surely. Sem. Fie, what doe I here, wayting on 'hem then? If they be nothing but meere states-men. Len. Yes, Your ladiship shall obserue their grauitie, And their reseruednesse, their many cautions, Fitting their persons. Sem. I doe wonder much, That states, and common-wealths employ not women, To be Ambassadors, sometimes! we should Doe as good publike seruice, and could make As honorable spies (for so Thvcidides Calls all Ambassadors.) Are they come, Cethegvs? Cet. Doe you aske me? Am I your scout, or baud? Len. O, Caivs, it is no such businesse. Cet. No? What do's a woman at it then? Sem. Good sir, There are of vs can be as exquisite traytors, As ere a male-conspirator of you all. Cet. I, at smock-treason, matron, I beleeue you; And if I were your husband; but when I Trust to your cob-web-bosomes any other Let me there die a flie, and feast you, spider. Len. You are too sowre, and harsh Cethegvs. Cet. You Are kind, and courtly. Il'd be torne in pieces, With wild Hippolytvs, nay proue the death, Euery limbe ouer, e're Il'd trust a woman, With wind, could I retaine it. Sem. Sir. They'll be trusted With as good secrets, yet, as you haue any: And carry 'hem too, as close, and as conceal'd, As you shall for your heart. Cet. Ile not contend with you Either in tongue, or carriage, good Calipso: Lon. Th'ambassadors are come. Cet. Thanks to thee Mercvry, That so hast rescu'd me. Len. How now, Voltvrtivs? Vol. They doe desire some speech with you, in priuate. Len. O! 'tis about the prophecie, belike, And promise of the Sibylls. Gab. It may be. Sem. Shun they, to treat with me, too? Gab. No, good lady, You may partake: I haue told 'hem, who you are. Sem. I should be loth to be left out, and here too. Cet. Can these, or such, be any aides, to vs? Looke they, as they were built to shake the world, Or be a moment, to our enterprise? A thousand, such as they are, could not make One atome of our soules. They should be men Worth heauens feare, that looking vp, but thus, Would make Iove stand vpon his guard, and draw Himselfe within his thonder; which, amaz'd, He should discharge in vaine, and they vn-hurt. Or, if they were, like Capanevs, at Thebes, They should hang dead, vpon the highest spires, And aske the second bolt, to be throwne downe. Why, Letvlvs, talke you so long? This time Had beene enough, t'haue scatter'd all the starres, T'haue quench'd the sunne, and moone, and made the world Despaire of day, or any light, but ours. Len. How doe you like this spirit? In such men, Mankind doth liue. They are such soules as these, That moue the world. Sen. I, though he beare me hard, I, yet, must doe him right. He is a spirit Of the right Martian breed. All. He is a Mars! Would we had time to liue here, and admire him. Len. Well, I doe see you would preuent the Consul. And I commend your care: It was but reason, To aske our letters, and we had prepar'd them. Goe in, and we will take an oath, and seale 'hem. You shall haue letters, too, to Catiline, To visite him i'the way, and to confirme The association. This our friend, Voltvrtivs, Shall goe along with you. Tell our great generall, That we are readie here; that Lvcivs Bestia The Tribune, is prouided of a speech, To lay the enuie of the warre on Cicero; That all but long for his approach, and person: And then, you are made free-men, as our selues. Cicero , Flaccvs, Pomtinivs, Sanga. I cannot feare the warre but to succeed well, Both for the honor of the cause, and worth Of him that doth command. For my colleague, Being so ill affected with the gout, Will not be able to be there in person; And then Petreivs, his lieutenant, must Of need take charge o'the armie: who is much The better souldier, hauing beene a Tribune, Prefect, Lieutenant, PrÃ¦tor in the warre, These thirtie yeeres, so conuersant i'the armie, As he knowes all the souldiers, by their names. Fla. They'll fight then, brauely, with him. Pom. I, and he Will lead 'hem on, as brauely. Cic. They'haue a foe Will aske their braueries, whose necessities Will arme him like a furie. But, how euer, I'le trust it to the manage, and the fortune Of good Petreivs, who's a worthy patriot: Metellvs Celer, with three legions, too, Will stop their course, for Gallia. How now, Fabivs? San. The traine hath taken. You must instantly Dispose your guards vpon the Miluian bridge: For, by that way, they meane to come. Cic. Then, thither Pomtinivs, and Flaccvs, I must pray you To lead that force you haue; and seize them all: Let not a person scape. Th'ambassadors Will yeeld themselues. If there be any tumult Ile send you aide. I, in meane time will call Lentvlvs to me, Gabinivs, and Cethegvs, Statilivs, Ceparivs, and all these, By seuerall messengers: who no doubt will come, Without sense, or suspicion. Prodigall men Feele not their owne stocke wasting. When I haue 'hem, Ile place those guards, vpon 'hem, that they start not. San. But what'll you doe with Sempronia? Cic. A states anger Should not take knowledge eyther of fooles, or women. I do not know whether my ioy or care Ought to be greater; that I haue discouer'd So foule a treason: or must vndergoe The enuie of so many great mens fate. But, happen what there can, I will be iust, My fortune may forsake me, not my vertue: That shall goe with me, and before me, still, And glad me, doing well, though I heare ill. Praetors, Allobroges, Voltvrtivs. Fla. Stand, who goes there? All. We are th'Allobroges And friends of Rome. Pom. If you be so, then yeeld Your selues vnto the PrÃ¦tors, who in name Of the whole Senate, and the people of Rome, Yet, till you cleare your selues, charge you of practise Against the State. Vol. Die friends, and be not taken. Fla. What voyce is that? Downe with 'hem all. All: We yeeld. Pom. What's he stands out? Kill him there. Vol. Hold, hold, hold. I yeeld vpon conditions. Fla. We giue none To traytors, strike him downe. Vol. My name's Voltvrtivs I know Pomtinivs. Pom. But he knowes not you, While you stand out vpon these trayterous termes. Vol. I'le yeeld vpon the safety of my life. Pom. If it be forfeyted, we cannot saue it. Vol. Promise to doe your best. I'am not so guilty, As many others, I can name; and will: If you will grant me fauour. Pom. All we can Is to deliuer you to the Consul. Take him, And thanke the gods, that thus haue saued Rome. Chorvs. Now, do our eares, before our eyes, Like men in mists, Discouer, who'ld the state surprise, And who resists? And, as these clouds doe yeeld to light, Now, do we see, Our thoughts of things, how they did fight, Which seem'd t'agree? Of what strange pieces are we made, Who nothing know; But, as new ayres our eares inuade, Still censure so? That now doe hope, and now doe feare, And now enuy; And then doe hate, and then loue deare, But know not, why: Or, if we doe, it is so late, As our best mood, Though true, is then thought out of date, And emptie of good. How haue we chang'd, and come about In euery doome, Since wicked Catiline went out, And quitted Rome? One while, we thought him innocent; And, then, w'accus'd The Consul, for his malice spent; And power abus'd. Since, that we heare, he is in armes, We thinke not so: Yet charge the Consul, with our harmes, That let him goe. So, in our censure of the state, We still doe wander; And make the carefull magistrate The marke of slander. What age is this, where honest men, Plac'd at the helme, A sea of some soule mouth, or pen, Shall ouer-whelme? And call their diligence, deceipt; Their vertue, vice; Their watchfulnesse, but lying in wait; And bloud, the price. O, let vs plucke this euill seede Out of our spirits; And giue, to euery noble deede, The name it merits. Lest we seeme falne (if this endures) Into those times, To loue disease: and brooke the cures Worse, then the crimes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. The Armie. Petreivs. It is my fortune, and my glorie, Souldiers, This day, to lead you on; the worthy Consul Kept from the honor of it, by disease: And I am proud, to haue so braue a cause To exercise your armes in. We not, now, Fight for how long, how broad, how great, and large Th'extent, and bounds o'th' people of Rome shall be; But to retaine what our great ancestors, With all their labours, counsells, arts, and actions, For vs, were purchasing so many yeeres. The quarrell is not, now, of fame, of tribute, Or of wrongs, done vnto confederates, For which, the armie of the people of Rome Was wont to moue: but for your owne republique, For the rais'd temples of th'immortall gods, For all your fortunes, altars, and your fires, For the deare soules of your lou'd wiues, and children, Your parents tombes, your rites, lawes, libertie, And, briefly, for the safety of the world: Against such men, as onely by their crimes Are knowne; thrust out by riot, want, or rashnesse. One sort, Sylla's old troops, left here in FesulÃ¦, Who sodainely made rich, in those dire times, Are since, by their vn-bounded, vast expence, Growne needy, and poore: and haue but left t'expect, From Catiline, new bills, and new proscriptions. These men (they say) are valiant; yet, I thinke 'hem Not worth your pause: For either their old vertue Is, in their sloth, and pleasures lost; or, if It tarry with 'hem, so ill match to yours, As they are short in number, or in cause. The second sort are of those (city-beasts, Rather then citizens) who whilst they reach After our fortunes, haue let flie their owne; These, whelm'd in wine, swell'd vp with meates, and weakned With hourely whoredomes, neuer left the side Of Catiline, in Rome; nor, here, are loos'd From his embraces: such, as (trust me) neuer In riding, or in vsing well their armes, Watching, or other militarie labour, Did exercise their youth; but learn'd to loue, Drinke, dance, and sing, make feasts, and be fine gamsters: And these will wish more hurt to you, then they bring you. The rest are a mixt kind, all sorts of furies, Adulterers, dicers, fencers, out-lawes, theeues, The murderers of their parents, all the sinke, And plague of Italie, met in one torrent, To take, to day, from vs the punishment, Due to their mischiefes, for so many yeeres. And who, in such a cause, and 'gainst such fiends, Would not now wish himselfe all arme, and weapon? To cut such poysons from the earth, and let Their bloud out, to be drawne away in cloudes, And pour'd, on some inhabitable place, Where the hot sunne, and slime breeds nought but monsters? Chiefly, when this sure ioy shall crowne our side, That the least man, that falls vpon our partie This day (as some must giue their happy names To fate, and that eternall memorie Of the best death, writ with it, for their countrey) Shall walke at pleasure, in the tents of rest; And see farre off, beneath him, all their host Tormented after life: and Catiline, there, Walking a wretched, and lesse ghost, then he. Ile vrge no more: Moue forward, with your eagles, And trust the Senates, and Romes cause to heauen. Arm. To thee, great father Mars, and greater Iove. CÃ¦sar , Crassvs. I Euer look'd for this of Lentvlvs, When Catiline was gone. Cra. I gaue 'hem lost, Many dayes since. Caes. But, wherefore did you beare Their letter to the Consul, that they sent you, To warne you from the citie? Cra. Did I know Whether he made it? It might come from him, For ought I could assure me: if they meant, I should be safe, among so many, they might Haue come, as well as writ. Caes. There is no losse In being secure. I haue, of late, too, ply'd him Thicke, with intelligences, but they'haue beene Of things he knew before. Cra. A little serues To keepe a man vpright, on these state-bridges, Although the passage were more dangerous. Let vs now take the standing part. Caes. We must, And be as zealous for't, as Cato. Yet I would faine helpe these wretched men. Cra. You cannot. Who would saue them, that haue betraid themselues? Cicero , Qvintvs, Cato. I will not be wrought to it, brother Qvintvs. There's no mans priuate enmitie shall make Me violate the dignitie of another. If there were proofe 'gainst Caesar, or who euer, To speake him guiltie, I would so declare him. But Qvintvs Catvlvs, and Piso both, Shall know, the Consul will not, for their grudge, Haue any man accus'd, or named falsly. Qvi. Not falsly: but if any circumstance, By the Allobroges, or from Voltvrtivs, Would carry it. Cic. That shall not be sought by me. If it reueale it selfe, I would not spare You, brother, if it pointed at you, trust me. Cato. Good Marcvs Tvllivs (which is more, then great) Thou had'st thy education, with the gods. Cic. Send Lentvlvs forth, and bring away the rest. This office, I am sorry, sir, to doe you. The Senate. What may be happy still, and fortunate. To Rome, and to this Senate: Please you, Fathers, To breake these letters, and to view them round. If that be not found in them, which I feare, I, yet, intreate, at such a time, as this, My diligence be not contemn'd. Ha' you brought The weapons hither, from Cethegvs house? Prae. They are without. Cic. Be readie, with Voltvrtivs, To bring him, when the Senate calls; and see None of the rest, conferre together. Fathers, What doe you reade? Is it yet worth your care, If not your feare, what you find practis'd there? Caes. It hath face of horror! Cra. I'am amaz'd! Cato. Looke there. Syl. Gods! Can such men draw c?mon aire? Cic. Although the greatnesse of the mischiefe, Fathers, Hath often made my faith small, in this Senate, Yet, since my casting Catiline out (for now I doe not feare the enuy of the word, Vnlesse the deed be rather to be fear'd, That he went hence aliue; when those I meant Should follow him, did not) I haue spent both dayes, And nights, in watching, what their fury' and rage Was bent on, that so staid, against my thought: And that I might but take 'hem in that light, Where, when you met their treason, with your eyes, Your minds, at length, would thinke for your owne safetie. And, now, 'tis done. There are their hands, and seales. Their persons, too, are safe, thankes to the gods. Bring in Voltvrtivs, and the Allobroges. These be the men, were trusted with their letters. Vol. Fathers, beleeue me, I knew nothing: I Was trauailing for Gallia, and am sorryâ Cic. Quake not, Voltvrtivs, speake the truth, and hope Well of this Senate, on the Consuls word. Vol. Then, I knew all. But truely I was drawne in But t'other day. Caes. Say, what thou know'st, and feare not. Thou hast the Senate, faith, and Consuls word, To fortifie thee. Vol. I was sent with lettersâ He answeres with feare and interruptions. And had a message tooâfrom Lentvlvsâ To Catilineâthat he should vse all aidesâ Seruants, or othersâand come with his armie, Assoone, vnto the cities as he couldâ For they were readie, and but staid for himâ To intercept those, that should flee the fireâ These men (the Allobroges) did heare it too. All. Yes, Fathers, and they tooke an oath, to vs. Besides their letters, that we should be free; And vrg'd vs, for some present aide of horse. Cic. Nay, here be other testimonies, Fathers, The weapons and armes are brought forth. Cethegvs armourie. Cra. What, not all these? Cic. Here's not the hundred part. Call in the Fencer, That we may know the armes to all these weapons. Come, my braue sword-player, to what actiue vse, Was all this steele proiuded? Cet. Had you ask'd In Sylla's dayes, it had beene to cut throats; But, now, it was to looke on, only: I lou'd To see good blades, and feele their edge, and points. To put a helme vpon a blocke, and cleaue it, And, now and then, to stab an armour through. Cic. Know you that paper? That will stab you through. Is it your hand? Hold, saue the pieces. Traytor, Hath thy guilt wak'd thy furie? Cet. I did write, I know not what; nor care not: That foole Lentvlvs Did dictate, and I t'other foole, did signe it. Cic. Bring in Statilivs: Do's he know his hand too? And Lentvlvs. Reach him that letter. Sta. I Confesse it all. Cic. Know you that seale yet, Pvblivs? Len. Yes, it is mine. Cic. Whose image is that, on it? Len. My grand-fathers. Cic. What, that renown'd good man, That did so only' embrace his countrey', and lou'd His fellow citizens! Was not his picture, Though mute, of power to call thee from a fact, So fouleâ Len. As what, impetuous Cicero? Cic. As thou art, for I doe not know what's fouler. Looke vpon these. Doe not these faces argue Thy guilt, and impudence? Len. What are these to me? I know 'hem not. All. No Pvblivs? we were with you, At Brvtvs house. Vol. Last night. Len. What did you there? Who sent for you? All. Your self did. We had letters From you, Cethegvs, this Statilivs here, Gabinivs Cimber, all, but from Longinvs, Who would not write, because he was to come Shortly, in person, after vs (he said) To take the charge o' the horse, which we should leuy. Cic. And he is fled, to Catiline, I heare. Len. Spies? spies? All. You told vs too, o' the Sibylls bookes, And how you were to be a king, this yeere, The twentieth, from the burning of the Capitoll. That three Cornelii were to raigne, in Rome, Of which you were the last: and prais'd Cethegvs, And the great spirits, were with you, in the action. Cet. These are your honorable Ambassadors, My soueraigne lord. Cat. Peace, that too bold Cethegvs. All. Besides Gabinivs, your agent, nam'd Avtronivs, Servivs Svlla, Vargvnteivs, And diuers others. Vol. I had letters from you, To Catiline, and a message, which I'haue told Vnto the Senate, truely, word for word: For which, I hope, they will be gracious to me. I was drawne in, by that same wicked Cimber, And thought no hurt at all. Cic. Voltvrtivs, peace. Where is thy visor, or thy voyce, now, Lentvlvs? Art thou confounded? Wherefore speak'st thou not? Is all so cleere, so plaine, so manifest, That both thy eloquence, and impudence, And thy ill nature, too, haue left thee, at once? Take him aside. There's yet one more, Gabinivs, The enginer of all. Shew him that paper, If he doe know it? Gab. I know nothing. Cic. No? Gab. No. Neyther will I know. Cat. Impudent head! Sticke it into his throate; were I the Consul, Il'd make thee eate the mischiefe, thou hast vented. Gab. Is there a law for't, Cato? Cat. Do'st thou aske After a law, that would'st haue broke all lawes, Of nature, manhood, conscience, and religion? Gab. Yes, I may aske for't. Cat. No, pernicious Cimber. Th'inquiring after good, do's not belong Vnto a wicked person. Gab. I but Cato Do's nothing, but by law. Cra. Take him aside. There's proofe enough, though he confesse not. Gab. Stay, I will confesse. All's true, your spies haue told you. Make much of'hem. Cet. Yes, and reward 'hem well, For feare you get no more such. See, they doe not Die in a ditch, and stinke, now you ha'done with 'hem; Or beg, o' the bridges, here in Rome, whose arches Their actiue industrie hath sau'd. Cic. See, Fathers, What mindes, and spirits these are, that, being conuicted Of such a treason, and by such a cloud Of witnesses, dare yet retayne their boldnesse? What would their rage haue done, if they had conquer'd? I thought, when I had thrust out Catiline, Neither the state, nor I, should need t'haue fear'd Lentvlvs sleepe here, or Longinvs fat, Or this Cethegvs rashnesse; it was he, I onely watch'd, while he was in our walls, As one, that had the braine, the hand, the heart. But now, we find the contrary! Where was there A people grieu'd, or a state discontent, Able to make, or helpe a warre 'gainst Rome, But these, th'Allobroges, and those they found? Whom had not the iust gods beene pleas'd to make More friends vnto our safety, then their owne, As it then seem'd, neglecting these mens offers, Where had we beene? or where the common-wealth? When their great Chiefe had beene call'd home? this man, Their absolute king (whose noble grand-father, Arm'd in pursuit of the seditious Gracchvs, Tooke a braue wound, for deare defence of that, Which he would spoile) had gather'd all his aides Of ruffians, slaues, and other slaughter-men? Giuen vs vp for murder, to Cethegvs? The' other ranke of citizens, to Gabinivs? The citie, to be fir'd by Cassivs? And Italie, nay the world, to be laid wast By cursed Catiline, and his complices? Lay but the thought of it, before you, Fathers, Thinke but with me you saw this glorious citie, The light of all the earth, tower of all nations, Sodainely falling in one flame. Imagine, You view'd your countrey buried with the heapes Of slaughter'd citizens, that had no graue; This Lentvlvs here, raigning, (as he dreamp't) And those his purple Senate; Catiline come With his fierce armie; and the cryes of matrons, The flight of children, and the rape of virgins, Shriekes of the liuing, with the dying grones On euery side t'inuade your sense; vntill The bloud of Rome, were mixed with her ashes! This was the spectacle these fiends intended To please their malice. Cet. I, and it would Haue beene a braue one, Consul. But your part Had not then beene so long, as now it is: I should haue quite defeated your oration; And slit that fine rhetoricall pipe of yours, I'the first Scene. Cat. Insolent monster! Cic. Fathers, Is it your pleasures, they shall be committed Vnto some safe, but a free custodie, Vntill the Senate can determine farder? Sen. It pleaseth well. Cic. Then, Marcvs Crassvs, Take you charge of Gabinivs: send him home Vnto your house. You Caesar, of Statilivs. Cethegvs shall be sent to Cornificivs; And Lentvlvs, to Pvblivs Lentvlvs Spinther, Who now is Ãdile. Cat. It were best, the PrÃ¦tors Carryed 'hem to their houses, and deliuered 'hem. Cic. Let it be so. Take 'hem from hence. Caes. But, first, Let Lentvlvs put off his PrÃ¦tor-ship. Len. I doe resigne it here vnto the Senate. Caes. So, now, there's no offence done to religion. Cat. Caesar, 'twas piously, and timely vrg'd. Cic. What doe you decree to th'Allobroges? That were the lights to this discouery? Cra. A free grant, from the state, of all their suites. Caes. And a reward, out of the publike treasure. Cat. I, and the title of honest men, to crowne 'hem. Cic. What to Voltvrtivs? Caes. Life, and fauour's well. Vol. I aske no more. Cat. Yes, yes, some money, thou need'st it. 'Twill keepe thee honest: want made thee a knaue. Syl. Let Flaccvs, and Pomtinivs, the PrÃ¦tors, Haue publike thankes, and Qvintvs Fabivs Sanga, For their good seruice. Cra. They deserue it all. Cat. But what doe we decree vnto the Consul, Whose vertue, counsell, watchfulnesse, and wisedome, Hath free'd the common-wealth, and without tumult, Slaughter, or bloud, or scarce raysing a force, Rescu'd vs all out of the iawes of fate? Cra. We owe our liues vnto him, and our fortunes. Caes. Our wiues, our children, parents, and our gods. Syl. We all are saued, by his fortitude. Cato. The common-wealth owes him a ciuicke gyrland. He is the onely father of his countrey. Caes. Let there be publike prayer, to all the gods, Made in that name, for him. Cra. And in these words. For that he hath, by his vigilance, preseru'd Rome from the flame, the Senate from the sword, And all her citizens from massacre. Cic. How are my labours more then paid, graue Fathers, In these great titles, and decreed honors! Such, as to me, first, of the ciuill robe, Of any man, since Rome was Rome, haue hap'ned; And from this frequent Senate: which more glads me, That I now see, yo'haue sense of your owne safety. If those good dayes come no lesse gratefull to vs, Wherein we are preseru'd from some great danger, Then those, wherein w'are borne, and brought, to light, Because the gladnesse of our safetie is certaine, But the condition of our birth not so; And that we are sau'd with pleasure, but are borne Without the sense of ioy: why should not, then, This day, to vs, and all posteritie Of ours, be had in equall fame, and honor, With that, when Romvlvs first rear'd these walls, When so much more is saued, then he built? Caes. It ought. Cra. Let it be added to our Fasti. Cic. What tumult's that? Fla. Here's one Tarqvinivs taken, Going to Catiline; and sayes he was sent By Marcvs Crassvs: whom he names, to be Guiltie of the conspiracy. Cic. Some lying varlet. Take him away, to prison. Cra. Bring him in, And let me see him. Cic. He is not worth it, Crassvs. Keepe him vp close, and hungrie, till he tell, By whose pernicious counsell, he durst slander So great, and good a citizen. Cra. (By yours I feare, 'twill proue.) Syl. Some o'the traytors, sure, To giue their action the more credit, bid him Name you, or any man. Cic. I know my selfe, By all the tracts, and courses of this businesse, Crassvs is noble, iust, and loues his countrey. Fla. Here is a libell too, accusing Caesar, From Lvcivs Vectivs, and confirm'd by Cvrivs. Cic. Away with all, throw it out o' the court. Caes. A tricke on me, too? Cic. It is some mens malice. I said to Cvrivs, I did not beleeue him. Caes. Was not that Cvrivs your spie, that had Reward decreed vnto him, the last Senate, With Fvlvia, vpon your priuate motion? Cic. Yes. Caes. But, he has not that reward, yet? Cic. No. Let not this trouble you, Caesar, none beleeues it. Caes. It shall not, if that he haue no reward. But if he haue, sure I shall thinke my selfe Very vntimely, and vnsafely honest, Where such, as he is, may haue pay t'accuse me. Cic. You shall haue no wrong done you, noble Caesar, But all contentment. Caes. Consul, I am silent. The Armie. Catiline. I neuer yet knew, Souldiers, that, in fight, Words added vertue vnto valiant men; Or, that a generalls oration made An armie fall, or stand: but how much prowesse Habituall, or naturall each mans brest Was owner of, so much in act it shew'd. Whom neither glory' or danger can excite, 'Tis vaine t'attempt with speech: for the minds feare Keepes all braue sounds from entring at that eare. I, yet, would warne you some few things, my friends, And giue you reason of my present counsailes. You know, no lesse then I, what state, what point Our affaires stand in; and you all haue heard, What a calamitous misery the sloth, And sleepinesse of Lentvlvs, hath pluck'd Both on himselfe, and vs: how, whilst our aides There, in the citie-look'd for, are defeated, Our entrance into Gallia, too, is stopt. Two armies wait vs: one from Rome, the other From the Gaule-Prouinces. And, where we are, (Although I most desire it) the great want Of corne, and victuall, forbids longer stay. So that, of need, we must remoue, but whither The sword must both direct, and cut the passage. I onely, therefore, wish you, when you strike, To haue your valours, and your soules, about you; And thinke, you carrie in your labouring hands The things you seeke, glorie, and libertie, Your countrie, which you want now, with the Fates, That are to be instructed, by our swords. If we can giue the blow, all will be safe to vs. We shall not want prouision, nor supplies. The colonies, and free townes will lye open. Where, if we yeeld to feare, expect no place, Nor friend, to shelter those, whom their owne fortune, And ill vs'd armes haue left without protection. You might haue liu'd in seruitude, or exile, Or safe at Rome, depending on the great ones; But that you thought those things vnfit for men. And, in that thought, you then were valiant. For no man euer yet chang'd peace for warre, But he, that meant to conquer. Hold that purpose. There's more necessitie, you should be such, In fighting for your selues, then they for others. Hee's base, that trusts his feet, whose hands are arm'd. Me thinkes, I see Death, and the Furies, waiting What we will doe; and all the heauen' at leisure For the great spectacle. Draw, then, your swords: And, if our destinie enuie our vertue The honor of the day, yet let vs care To sell our selues, at such a price, as may Vn-doe the world, to buy vs; and make Fate, While shee tempts ours, feare her owne estate. The Senate. Sen. What meanes this hastie calling of the Senate? Sen. We shall know straight. Wait, till the Consul speakes. Pom. Fathers Conscript, bethinke you of your safeties, And what to doe, with these conspirators; Some of their clients, their free'd men, and slaues 'Ginne to make head: there is one of Lentvlvs bawds Runnes vp and downe the shops, through euery street, With money to corrupt, the poore artificers, And needie tradesmen, to their aide. Cethegvs Hath sent, too, to his seruants; who are many, Chosen, and exercis'd in bold attemptings, That forth-with they should arme themselues, and proue His rescue: All will be in instant vproare, If you preuent it not, with present counsailes. We haue done what we can, to meet the furie, And will doe more. Be you good to your selues. Cic. What is your pleasure, Fathers, shall be done? Syllanvs, you are Consul next design'd. Your sentence, of these men. Syl. 'Tis short, and this. Since they haue sought to blot the name of Rome, Out of the world; and raze this glorious empire With her owne hands, and armes, turn'd on her selfe: I thinke it fit they die. And, could my breath Now, execute 'hem, they should not enioy An article of time, or eye of light, Longer, to poyson this our common ayre. Sen. I thinke so too. Sen. And I. Sen. And I. Sen. And I. Cic. Your sentence, Caivs Caesar. Caes. Conscript Fathers, In great affaires, and doubtfull, it behooues Men, that are ask'd their sentence, to be free From either hate, or loue, anger, or pittie: For, where the least of these doehinder, there The mind not easily discernes the truth. I speake this to you, in the name of Rome, For whom you stand; and to the present cause: That this foule fact of Lentvlvs, and the rest, Weigh not more with you, then your dignitie; And you be more indulgent to your passion, Then to your honor. If there could be found A paine, or punishment, equall to their crimes, I would deuise, and helpe: but, if the greatnesse Of what they ha' done, exceed all mans inuention, I thinke it fit, to stay, where our lawes doe. Poore pettie states may alter, vpon humour, Where, if they' offend with anger, few doe know it, Because they are obscure; their fame, and fortune Is equall, and the same. But they, that are Head of the world, and liue in that seene height, All mankind knowes their actions. So wee see, The greater fortune hath the lesser licence. They must nor fauour, hate, and least be angrie: For what with others is call'd anger, there, Is crueltie, and pride. I know Syllanvs, Who spoke before me, a iust, valiant man, A louer of the state, and one that would not, In such a businesse, vse or grace, or hatred; I know, too, well, his manners, and modestie: Nor doe I thinke his sentence cruell (for 'Gainst such delinquents, what can be too bloudie?) But that it is abhorring from our state; Since to a citizen of Rome, offending, Our lawes giue exile, and not death. Why then Decrees he that? 'Twere vaine to thinke, for feare; When, by the diligence of so worthy a Consul, All is made safe, and certaine. Is't for punishment? Why, death's the end of euills, and a rest, Rather then torment: It dissolues all griefes. And beyond that, is neither care, nor ioy. You heare, my sentence would not haue 'hem die. How then? set free, and increase Catilines armie? So will they, being but banish'd. No, graue Fathers, I iudge 'hem, first, to haue their states confiscate, Then, that their persons remaine prisoners I' the free townes, farre off from Rome, and seuer'd: Where they might neither haue relation, Hereafter, to the Senate, or the people. Or, if they had, those townes, then to be mulcted, As enemies to the state, that had their guard. Sen. 'Tis good, and honorable, Caesar, hath vtterd. Cic. Fathers, I see your faces, and your eyes All bent on me, to note of these two censures, Which I incline to. Either of them are graue, And answering the dignitie of the speakers, The greatnesse of th'affaire, and both seuere. One vrgeth death: and he may well remember. This state hath punish'd wicked citizens so. The other bonds: and those perpetuall, which He thinkes found out for the more singular plague. Decree, which you shall please. You haue a Consul, Not readier to obey, then to defend, What euer you shall act, for the republique; And meet with willing shoulders any burden, Or any fortune, with an euen face, Though it were death: which to a valiant man Can neuer happen foule, nor to a Consul Be immature, or to a wise man wretched. Syl. Fathers, I spake, but as I thought: the needes O'th'common-wealth requir'd. Cat. Excuse it not. Cic. Cato, speake you your sentence. Cat. This it is. You here dispute, on kinds of punishment, And stand consulting, what you should decree 'Gainst those, of whom, you rather should beware, This mischiefe is not like those common facts, Which, when they are done, the lawes may prosequute. But this, if you prouide not, ere it happen, When it is happen'd, will not wait your iudgement. Good Caivs Caesar, here, hath very well, And subtilly discours'd of life, and death, As if he thought those things, a prettie fable, That are deliuer'd vs of hell, and furies, Or of the diuers way, that ill men goe From good, to filthy, darke, and vgly places. And therefore, he would haue these liue; and long too; But farre from Rome, and in the small free townes, Lest, here, they might haue rescue: As if men, Fit for such acts, were only in the citie, And not throughout all Italie? or, that boldnesse Could not doe more, where it found least resistance? 'Tis a vaine counsaile, if he thinke them dangerous. Which, if he doe not, but that he alone, In so great feare of all men, stand vn-frighted, He giues me cause, and you, more to feare him. I am plaine, Fathers. Here you looke about, One at another, doubting what to doe; With faces, as you trusted to the gods, That still haue sau'd you; and they can do't: But, They are not wishings, or base womanish prayers, Can draw their aides; but vigilance, counsell, action: Which they will be ashamed to forsake. 'Tis sloth they hate, and cowardise. Here, you haue The traytors in your houses, yet, you stand, Fearing what to doe with 'hem; Let 'hem loose, And send 'hem hence with armes, too; that your mercie May turne your miserie, as soone as't can. O, but they, are great men, and haue offended, But, through ambition. We would spare their honor: I, if themselues had spar'd it, or their fame, Or modestie, or either god, or man: Then I would spare 'hem. But, as things now stand, Fathers, to spare these men, were to commit A greater wickednesse, then you would reuenge. If there had beene but time, and place, for you, To haue repair'd this fault, you should haue made it; It should haue beene your punishment, to 'haue felt Your tardie error: but necessitie, Now, bids me say, let 'hem not liue an houre, If you meane Rome should liue a day. I haue done. Sen. Cato hath spoken like an oracle. Cra. Let it be so decreed. Sen. We are all fearefull. Syl. And had beene base, had not his vertue rais'd vs. Sen. Goe forth, most worthy Consul, wee'll assist you. Caes. I'am not yet chang'd in my sentence, Fathers. Cat. No matter. What be those? Syl. Letters, for Caesar. Cat. From whom? let 'hem be read; in open Senate; Fathers, they come from the conspirators. I craue to haue 'hem read, for the republique Caes. Cato, reade you it. 'Tis a loue-letter, From your deare sister, to me: though you hate me. Doe not discouer it. Cat. Hold thee, drunkard. Consul. Goe forth, and confidently. Caes. You'll repent This rashnesse, Cicero. Prae. Caesar shall repent it. Cic. Hold friends. Prae. Hee's scarce a friend vnto the publike. Cic. No violence. Caesar, be safe: Leade on: Where are the publike executioners? Bid 'hem wait on vs. On, to Spinthers house. Bring Lentvlvs forth. Here, you, the sad reuengers Of capitall crimes, against the publike, take This man vnto your iustice: strangle him. Len. Thou do'st well, Consul. 'Twas a cast at dice, In Fortvnes hand, not long since, that thy selfe Should'st haue heard these, or other words as fatall. Cic. Leade on, to Qvintvs Cornificivs house. Bring forth Cethegvs. Take him to the due Death, that he hath deseru'd: and let it be Said, He was once. Cet. A beast, or, what is worse, A slaue, Cethegvs. Let that be the name For all that's base, hereafter: That would let This worme pronounce on him; and not haue trampled His body intoâHa! Art thou not mou'd? Cic. Iustice is neuer angrie: Take him hence. Cet. O, the whore Fortvne! and her bawds the Fates! That put these tricks on men, which knew the way To death by a sword. Strangle me, I may sleepe: I shall grow angrie with the gods, else. Cic. Leade To Caivs Caesar, for Statilivs. Bring him, and rude Gabinivs, out. Here, take 'hem To your cold hands, and let 'hem feele death from you. Gab. I thanke you, you doe me a pleasure. Sta. And me too. Cat. So, Marcvs Tvllivs, thou maist now stand vp, And call it happy Rome, thou being Consul. Great parent of thy countrie, goe and let The old men of the citie, ere they die, Kisse thee; the matrons dwell about thy necke; The youths, and maides, lay vp, 'gainst they are old, What kind of man thou wert, to tell their nephewes, When, such a yeere, they reade, within our Fasti, Thy Consul-ship. Who's this? Petreivs? Cic. Welcome, Welcome, renowned souldier. What's the newes? This face can bring no ill with't, vnto Rome. How do's the worthy Consul, my colleague? Pet. As well as victorie can make him, sir. He greets the Fathers, and to me hath trusted The sad relation of the ciuill strife; For, in such warre, the conquest still is black. Cic. Shall we with-draw into the house of Concord? Cat. No, happy Consul, here; let all eares take The benefit of this tale. If he had voyce, To spread vnto the poles, and strike it through The center, to the Antipodes; It would aske it. Pet. The streights, and needs of Catiline being such, As he must fight with one of the two armies, That then had neere enclos'd him; It pleas'd Fate, To make vs th'obiect of his desperate choise, Wherein the danger almost paiz'd the honor: And as he riss', the day grew black with him; And Fate descended neerer to the earth, As if shee meant, to hide the name of things, Vnder her wings, and make the world her quarrie. At this we rous'd, lest one small minutes stay Had left it to be enquir'd, what Rome was. And (as we ought) arm'd in the confidence Of our great cause, in forme of battaile, stood. Whilst Catiline came on, not with the face Of any man, but of a publique ruine: His count'nance was a ciuill warre it selfe. And all his host had standing in their lookes, The palenesse of the death, that was to come. Yet cryed they out like vultures, and vrg'd on, As if they would precipitate our fates. Nor staid we longer for 'hem; But himselfe Strooke the first stroke: And, with it, fled a life. Which cut, it seem'd, a narrow necke of land, Had broke betweene two mightie seas; and either Flow'd into other; for so did the slaughter: And whirl'd about, as when two violent tides Meet, and not yeeld. The Furies stood, on hills, Circling the place, and trembled to see men Doe more, then they: whilst pietie left the field, Grieu'd for that side, that, in so bad a cause, They knew not, what a crime their valour was. The sunne stood still, and was, behind the cloud The battaile made, seene sweating, to driue vp His frighted horse, whom still the noyse droue backward. And now had fierce Enyo, like a flame, Consum'd all it could reach, and then it selfe; Had not the fortune of the common-wealth Come Pallas-like, to euery Roman thought. Which Catiline seeing, and that now his troops Couer'd that earth, they'had fought on, with their trunkes, Ambitious of great fame, to crowne his ill, Collected all his furie, and ran in (Arm'd with a glorie, high as his despaire) Into our battaile, like a Lybian lyon, Vpon his hunters, scornefull of our weapons, Carelesse of wounds, plucking downe liues about him, Till he had circled in himselfe with death: Then fell he too, t'embrace it where it lay. And as, in that rebellion 'gainst the gods, Minerva holding forth Medvsa's head, One of the gyant brethren felt himselfe Grow marble at the killing sight, and now, Almost made stone, began t'inquire, what flint, What rocke it was, that crept through all his limmes, And, ere he could thinke more, was that he fear'd; So Catiline, at the sight of Rome in vs, Became his tombe: yet did his looke retayne Some of his fiercenesse, and his hands still mou'd, As if he labour'd, yet, to graspe the state, With those rebellious parts. Cat. A braue bad death. Had this beene honest now, and for his countrey, As 'twas against it, who had ere fallen greater? Cic. Honor'd Petreivs, Rome, not I, must thanke you. How modestly has he spoken of himselfe! Cat. He did the more. Cic. Thanks to the immortall gods, Romans, I now am paid for all my labours, My watchings, and my dangers. Here conclude Your praises, triumphs, honors, and rewards, Decreed to me: only the memorie Of this glad day, if I may know it liue Within your thoughts, shall much affect my conscience, Which I must alwayes studie before fame. Though both be good, the latter yet is worst, And euer is ill got, without the first. THE END.</field>
