My sp'rit o Lord make free of fleshly lets That I may climb thy sacred Cabinets With wings of faith for well to understand To doe this worke which I now take in hand. Now let thy motions like a river swell With gurgling streames of graces that excell Within my heart, that in sweet verses rare Thy might in mercy I may well declare, How thou thine owne 'gainst all that do conspire Canst safely keep ev'n in a burning fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">King Nebuchadnezzar. Wee Gods on earth should climb supernall stories Wee should atchieve great things to grace our glories; Behind us we should leave some cleare character That wee have lived on this earths theater, That afterdeath our names in all mens eyes May be like starres that brandish in the skyes. The Echo of our name with gentle gales Will make the Hills to sound with babling Vales: If that great things wee doe, wee fame will find; Mens mouths like cornets with their curled wind Will make record of all the worthy things Which are performed by great and mighty kings Wee in our worke ressemble should a tree In branches that beare most fruitfullie; To doe great things wee should not be amaz'd Why should our names be either rent or raz'd? Some passe their time in their most merry drinking And some are witlesse in their silly thinking, Some with great blood their courage strive to seale, But in a trice they topsie turvie wheele, Such glorious shews can not have long abode, When they fall downe most live a wretched clod. But greater things now come into my mind, Whereby I may some greater glory find 'Mong my Caldeans who are learn'd and wise Have for mine honour giv'n me this advise, That nothing can the glory of my name More high extoll and spread abroad my fame Then that of gold I should incontinent Set up ane image for a monument. Now with all haste that image I ordaine To be set up within faire Duras plaine, Which in the province is of Babylon, Let all make haste, and end this worke anone; I highly mind this image for to raise, And make it glorious, that on it may gaze The wisest eyes that are in all the land And bow their knees so soone as I command; The height thereof shall cubits be three score With six in breadth and neither lesse nor more. Now must a Herauld be most quickly sent To charge the princes that incontinent With Governours, Captaines, and Treasurers, And Judges, Sherifs, and the Counsellers With all the rulers ev'n of each province And them ordaine to come unto their prince Most willingly with great submission That they may see the dedication Of this mine image a most stately thing A glorious worke that well beseems a king. Ho such a one of these the standers by Goe warne the princes, t'others also cry That they resort to see this worke of owrs Unto this plain inammelled all with flowrs, Whene stately stands this image made of gold To sleight my precepts none darre be so bold. The Kings Herauld conveeneth the princes etc. I am now sent with great authority To publish that the king his majesty Hath with great cost set up in Duras plaine Ane glorious image which he doth ordaine To be respected both by great and small, He hath me sent you for this end to call; It is his will so for to make a muster Of all his Peers, for to give grace and luster Unto his image for memoriall, Which must be honour'd both by great and small. This I you tell, under the heighest paine, Lusk not in sloath, kings precepts not disdaine In swarty moors the image doth not stand, Nor yet on hills, but in faire Duras Land. The Princes. Most kings in thousand vanities delight, Some for to hunt, some for to whoore or fight, By needlesse wars some off lop legs and armes And will not but by force lay downe their armes; So often they who should have sav'd the nation Doe make of all a fearefull desolation, Some passe their time in riot drunkennesse Some with their tributs subjects poore oppresse, And hoord their gold, and eke their silver both Which subject are to rust, as cloaths to moth: Some wast their times in thousand vanities Like children chaseing gawdie Butterflies. But yee, Sir, alwayes by your might and powr Are for your mens defence a strongest towr; Yee doe in mercy fortify the weake, In justice yee men stubborn still doe break: Yee guide all well, most equall unto all, Oppressours now downe let their weapons fall Who by distressing men with miseries To springs of teares oft turned many eyes: But what can feede the eye or fill the hand, If of the gods men nothing understand? Wee have well heard how yee in Duras plaine To be set up ane image did ordaine The like whereof in Babylon is none That ever heard by any Princes done. The Governours. When kings are foolish rageing in their ire They doe their people calcine as with fire; They will be high and they will all command, But for well doeing in no stead they stand: They men destroye with fearefull tempests sterne They wound their worthies and can not discerne The man that truely is the worthy subject, Who is most wise of wrath they make the object; They trouble all not likeing counsell good, Till all their subjects be in knees to blood. But yee, Sir, by your wisdome that is cleare, Doe better rule and sift all things more neare: Yee love the gods, for them yee spare not gold As in this image all men may behold. By this yee shall among men get a name No worke at all could more increase your fame. The Captaines. The Captaines joye's to see the squadrons reele With bloody sword, and to and fro to wheele: It is our play to see men fierce renew The charge, and so with bloody sword pursewe Their foes afresh, and in a wrath extreme Them to invade and round about behem. But yet at last wee must to gods draw neare, That they may free us of all faults and feare; Wee can not rest secure and confident, Except the gods be served in our tent: What are the strongest but like potters crust? How soone are they all crush'd and turn'd to dust? What have wee win when wee in grave are dead Though wee have spoild and fill'd the world with dread? When all our dayes wee lived have like fooles Wee must at last ev'n tumble downe our tooles, Our speares and swordes must all at last give place To those who by their wisdome doe make peace. O happy king who spare mens blood and bones, With blunted sword who sit on Mercys Thrones; When wee were young wee smiled with Ha Ha Wee smelled the Battell and did cry a french word of warre Sa, Sa But waxed old we thinke it now a grace That farre from trumpets wee may live in peace. O Sir, but yee a happy course intend This golden image for to recommend Unto your subjects, that they lesse and more In Duras plaine the same may all adore. The Judges. When princes who sit in the highest place With Judges wise, are voide of wit and grace Then Judges blush and covred are with shame, Their teares out gush, they heare nothing but blame: With greefe they see them on their fierie steedes Camboling high with tottring crownes on heads, Rushing in dangers with a gloomy front, As neere to get as for to give affront. But prudent yee take up a calmer course, Your actions wise are mater for discourse To wisest mouths, your progresse is farre softer Example good to all that shall come after: Your image rich doth unto us declare That for your grandour all the gods will care. The Treasurers. When kings in haste doe make a needlesse warre The Treasurers doe find that they doe marre Their proper profit, and their countrey crosse, In civill warres the kings gets ay the losse: His rents are spent that should uphold the crowne His men are slaine, and all the fields troad downe; All runs with blood, the people all agast perplexed are, all wracked is at last. Heere all's in fire, and there a stout forlorne The poore man stobs and strips the Noble borne: Such bloody wars all treasurers doe grieve, If warres persist they all may take their Lieve. But yee, Sir, far from such a furious way In signe of peace ane image reare the day A worthy worke, wee doubt not but for this The gods above will you most richly blesse. The Counsellors. Unto all kings wee owe firme fealty And kings should love men for their loyalty; Who ever he be that giv'n is unto wiles Himself the first most shamefully beguiles: Men should be straight and upright in their wayes If they desire to see most pleasant dayes: If kings would have their good things to abide, They must not armed be with pawes of pride Kings should not be like horse or ox forlorne Who strike with hooves and also push with horne: Kings fathers are and should themselves constraine To beare some wrongs, and for to ease of paine Their subjects poore, and not as excrement To cast them oft, as though by such intent They could them win; this surely shall befall Such doeings at a gasp shall vanish all. Then shall ensue great blood and misery And good things shall be as a sheame past by Which not returns; so in this case dependant Some shall be plaintif others some defendant: Then all at last goes in a hurly burly All upside downe is turned topsie turvie. But yee, Sir, farre from such a furious way In signe of peace ane image reare the day A worthy worke; wee doubt not but for this The gods above will you most richly blesse. The Sheriffes. When gods are wroth they make the rockes to shrink, They make the mountaines mouldring downe to sink Or leap like calves; the errours of mans life They boldly scourge ev'n with their terrours rife: They thrust mens feet into the stocks most strait, Their judgments still on vilest wretches wait; Shall men goe mock them as a man another, And think that they such faults can closely cover? But yee, Sir, farre from such a furious way For their service ane image reare the day A worthy worke wee doubt not but for this The gods above will you most richly blesse. The Rulers of the Provinces. Whene kings are proud and will not counsell heare, The land with blood is fill'd and sallow feare In time of peace the wardrob stuffed still With sumptuous silks and of all bravery full, The gold ground velvets worthy of a prince Doe plenteously abound in each province; As wee can tell the garners fill'd with graine, The herds and flocks doe skip upon the plaine, But when by war men leave their homely coats, And men doe rune to cut each others throats, These who heard birds with warbling repetitions, For musick then heare bloody expeditions Sounding resounding by the drumming croud And trumpets als with their alarum loud, Then souldiers fierce through all the province goe, And all therein they fill with wrack and wo: None dare say ill done, for to tell his want, Each man devores ev'n like a cormorant: All goes to wrack, the land is fill'd with feares With cryes and noise, with troubles and with teares Maugre the lawes, men given unto their lust, Doe ravish maids, and cities turne to dust, Each man doth run his fellow to devore, The countrey all is fill'd with blood and gore But yee, Sir, far from such a furious way In signe of peace ane image rare this day, Have heere set up; we doubt not but for this The gods above will you most richly blesse. King Nebuchadnezzar. Religion mak's men meeke; and also mild, Who were like beasts in flaggy fence most wilde To brood both rapt revenge and crueltie, As by experience wee may dayly see: God on a hill with thorny thrummed top Spak unto Moses: who could clamber up These places steepe? But I doe well ordaine My golden image on a pleasant plaine For easie accesse; there no winds doe yeeld Great stormes, while they goe whisking ov'r the field: I too great paines of no man heere doe crave, Religion should not make a man a slave: I heard by Daniel when their God did glance With eyes of fire that Moses fell in Transe; When so appear'd with sterne and furious looke, Heak their bones with shivering chilenesse strooke: Then such a blustring tempest doune did fall; That Moses trembled, said, I tremble all But this our image stands upon a plaine No climbing's heere, no clambring up with paine To trouble men, except men whiles goe idle By holy dayes, they sure can brooke no bridle; Men must refresh'd with musick be and playes, And now and then keepe some festivall dayes, And that they may with greater zeale adore, Some image must be setled them before: This I have done: ane image not of mud I have set up, but of a metall good With great expence and cost as all may see Kings in such things should not base niggards be. The Princes. Ane image that is richly high imbost Of burnish'd gold of ane exceeding cost; It is a worke for such a mighty prince As may be seene by us from each province: Most princes in a most ingratfull torrent Upon their pleasures lash a swelling current. Not thanking gods who have with great renowne Upon their heads set a most glorious Crowne: Your care for gods makes you contemne all gaine, Your fame the blowes and burnt may well sustaine Of cursed tongues, no man can shake the head At all your workes which godly are indeede. Gold garlands yee doe twist while some allowe But willow wreathes for gods to deck their browe O but your image stately is to see, In all the earth the like thereof not be. The Governours. Men who below would conquer a great name Build castells faire to spread abroad their fame But at the last their walls foundation shrinks, The lime it crumbles from the yawning chinks, The sealling upward tott'ring all doth quiver, And time at last the buildings makes to shiver As for this image it shall yawne a waye That glory may in ane immortall day Come and exalt Nebuchadnezzars name All glorious made with garlands of great fame. The Captaines. When wee are young our pleasure is in wars With sword in hand to brandish and make scars: Wee up and downe to kill and spoile doe reele Our caps are yron and our sattens steele: If wee with lances can in furie tilt Wee justle, and not care what blood be spilt: When wee are mounted with a crespy crest To rush in batell wee then think it best; This men of courage doe for to obey Their princes who think battells but a play: Toe many kings for to obtaine their will, Doe little care what blood their subjects spill What care such though ev'n in a twinkling trice In equall halves each others heads doe slyce; The battell found they free of danger like, They laugh to heare mens swords mens heads down strike Men at their will lye night and day in armes; And at rencounters want both legs and armes. Some by their pride, and some by want of wit, Put all their kingdomes in a bloody fit: Some willfull are, and fill their land with feares Not careing though the earth still swimme with teares: But yee your time on better purpose spend Yee spare mens lives, and which wee must commend, Yee feare the gods to serve them ye delite In doeing so yee alwayes hit the white. The Judges. When kings are foolish all is full of feares Then fields with blood and cheekes doe swime with teares: Then judgment seates ly empty by such a boast, As summer flowres are hid in winter frost; These who were rich now bare foot hop about, Even seeking bread with teares still gushing out: While they behold these who their lands doe sack Of cares the clusters lye upon their back And houses painted with cleare glistring studs, Are set on fire, and spoil'd of all their goods; Where as before their fields great store of graine Did yeeld, they beg; for nothing doth remaine, The doloures which such dayly doe renew Doe dye mens faces of a sable hew; But ye hit wisely far from such a rage, By your great skill yee angry surges swage: A cunning steers man yee can knowe the tide And make good use so that yee well can guide Your subjects and from wrath yourselfe refraine Till that the welkin cloudy cleare againe, And sens grow calme; and binds lay downe their boast; More wisedome doth then any Armed Hoast; And which is more to be extoll'd by all, Ye for the Gods have a memoriall Set up of gold, of height, cubits threescore, The breadth whereof is five, and als one more; With little dinne in good things yee abound; The fullest vessels have the lesser sound. The Treasurers. Some princes are like pikes which quickly scoure The creeks of rivers and therein devoure The smaller fishes, and the feeble «fry» try, Their will's a law, they rageing by and by, Beat with their billowes 'gainst them that withstand The least of things they proudly doe command; They subjects load with tribute toll and tax, And subsidies which break their peoples backs, And after that they spend in needlesse warres, Their treasures all, and fill their land with jarres: Thus by their folly they all at the last, What gath'red was most lavishly doe wast; But yee your gold for Gods doe well imploy While they their goods in vanitie destroy; That which they have is blasted with a curse, Their treasurers all have still an empty purse: Ye purchase peace; the spiders busie taske Is wov'n within the souldiers plumed caske: No need of armes, all men now glad and blyth Speare into prunehooke and the sword to syth Well turned have; now is your chiefest care, For Gods above to dresse this image rare. The Counsellers. When kings are wise the counsellers have joye, Most glade they are such jewells to enjoye: It makes their hearts to dance and mouths to sing Like Nightinggales in a most pleasant spring Upon a Hawthorne in the morning dew, Where warbling they their nots doe still renew But o when princes make their will a law, Not seeking love, if subjects stand in aw; Such rage with havocke and with horror too, If they command they care not what they doe. Legges to lop off to them is but a play, As als to hack and hew mens armes away: They fill the land with creples; in word They care not for the bloody rageing sword: Because they willfull, counsell will not take, They at the last bring all their land to wrack; But yee, Sir, wisely doe your time bestow, To honour gods which we doe well allow: Yee still goe forward and recoyle not back, Your sword ye bath not in a gorry track Of subjects blood, to make more teares fall downe, Then there be moats that reele within the sunne. The Sheriffes. A wicked prince with burdens heavy loads His subjects still, he them as croking toads Abhorres, not careing though the sword doe sweep Their life away, they lying in a heap: Such in their rage care not what blood they spill, If they at last can get of all their will: They still like Falcons aime most furiously With sudden souse to shew their tyrrany. But yee love peace and doe abhorr to kill, Yee rather would your balme in wounds distill Your way is not in bloody red carreeres Of tyrants, who still cry for swords and speares, Untill their subjects murdred be at last, And fertile lands by wares be all laid wast. Such wickednesse ye allwayes doe disdaine, The marks thereof stand up in Duras plaine. The Rulers of the Provinces. Princes profane shall not their works atchieve When judgements come who shall them then reprieve Though they a Breastplate get of strongest steele; They shall not faile of gods the wrath to feele: When people still by wars are made to cry Doubtlesse the gods will heare them by and by And let them knowe though safe they stand aloofe For wounds, their crownes be not at perill proof, Though they should flee with wings, yet pause they must, And at the last returne with shame to dust: These cruell men whatever they now doe dreame Shall spew at last that bloody purple streame Of slaughtred children which for sacrifice They murdred have by their deceitful guise: When wicked princes rageing act their part We Rulers of provinces feele the smart. But ye your gold give for the gods service, Ye care for orgies, and for sacrifice, To honour them who sure your honour shall, And at the last pay use and principall. King Nebuchadnezzer. I see my Peeres I have your approbation, That of this image be a dedication, Your words declare your mind, and which is more, I see you all now standing it before With great respect: yee know all well this thing, That subjects must in all obey their king: Kings precepts all on fiery wings are borne Like thundring bullets, none but men forlorne Dare lift the crest and care but say wherefore? Our will's a law, we will doe it therefore: No other reason wee are bound to give, Let them obey who have desire to live For wee are great Lords both of life and death, And wee command each man and all he hath: These who are wise, obey us by and by Madde fooles they are who darre our lawes defy; The people, peeres, in this must sympathize To stoope to kings who can both patronize Or punish men; that all may stand in awe, Kings will must stand to subjects for a law; Now it is time that wee a Herauld send That all my land be warn'd from end to end, That when they shall heare sounding pleasantly The Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbute, psaltery, the Dulcimer and musick of all «kynd» kinde, That then they all with humblenesse of mind, Adore the image that most stately thing Sett up by me of Babell great the king And who refuseth that which I require Shall sure be cast into a furnace fire; But who obey they shall get my protection Thus I'le reward my subjects low subjection. The Princes. Kings sit on Thrones and handle scepters bright, They armed are with majestie and might; What they command who dare reply wherefore? Their will may serve for reason lesse or more, Your majestie by your continuall sessions May all command, and punish all transgressions What ye command is not for avarice, To wine by bribes or wrest with ill device: Your thoughts such thoughts do all now farre surmount Ye doe not as your fathers all wer wont: Yee seeke no gaine, but to respect the gods, Who shrinks at this, deserveth sharpest rods, Most justly may all such with thongs most fast Be bound and in a fierie Furnace cast. The Governoures. Your majestie hath heere a pleasant plaine Where yee your subjects orderly ordaine; Floures with their coloures heere rejoice the eye, And in the nose they smell most fragrantly: Trees with their twigs doe one another tangle, On branches faire the daintie fruits doe dangle. Ye with sweet musick cause rejoice the eare; While men in Dura dulcimers do heare With Cornet, Harp, Sackbut and psalterie Which join'd in sounds make heavenly melodie; Good princes precepts goe with gentle gushing Like silver streames through pleasant pipes still rushing With curled waves that water all the land, Who dare refuse what such men do command? Who dare contemne, deserves the rigour rather Of Judges then the mercies of a father Most justly may all such with thongs most fast Be bound and in a fierie Furnace cast. The Captaines. Men of our coat, of Drums do alwayes dreame And speares and swords to make mens blood to sheame: Ha, ha! our horse laugh when of Battell fell They heare the noise and also feele the smell, Like Eagles frankly soaring neer the sky They goe to stroakes with courage by and by So much more men in wrath like angrie Bees, Do soone resolve to fight in blood to knees, While wee such thoughts do thus brood in our heart, Wee doe thereby our selves at least subvert, For we the gods forget most carlessely, While we in Battells fight thus cruelly, Or do ambush in any bushy thorne, Or lye in wait in caves or field of corne To trap mens lives, for this we in and out Doe fiske in countreyes which lye round about, In glorious shewes our selves we nimbly shroud And gaze upon our plums like peacocks proud, Wee roare wee rage like Boares and Beares with paws, Wee spoile the poore and grip with Griphins claws What wee can get; with whip, and rope, and racke; Wee in a rage thus of all shipwrack make To doe mischeefe wee wickedly combine, We spiders like doe weave such woefull twine, Slaves to our house not haveing any might Our lusts to bridle or them range aright. But o of you, wee better things may learne, To serve the gods ye togh us at your sterne: ye teach us by your image made of gold, To honour gods, as all may now behold: Who 'gainst your purpose shew themselves as foes Let them be thrilled with ten thousand throes: Most justly may all such with thongs most fast Be bound and in a fierie Furnace cast. The Judges. Men of our coat on benches high doe sit, It is our part to tell what wee think fit; We judges are for to give our decrees Against men given to falshood and to lies; 'Gainst fighters and vile Drunkards, who tun in The strongest drink which button all their skin, And him who still with filthy purpose makes His mouth loathsome like most filthy Jakes: But men will scorne at all the Judges rods Except they be train'd up to know the gods This ye will doe, ye furnish righly gold Now for this Jmage as wee heere behold: O happy yee; yea happy thryse therefore; Maugre envy your name for evermore Shall famous be; princes in court delights Oft spend their tyme with turneyes tilts and fights, Which vanish shall like mist before the wind, No fruits they shall of all such pleasures find: Such at their best are like the ragged Bramble Which burnes their people or their skins bescramble. But your good workes most glorious still abide; Like spangles on the tresses of a Bride, Which in the sunbeames gloriously doe glance And shaken with a little gale doe dance, If any will your image not adore The fierie Furnace him shall soone devore. The Treasurers. The gods have given rich Treasures unto Kings With honours great and many other things: When kings againe the gods most thankfully Respect, it is indeed their honour hy, But when they raise their tops unto the sky And from the gods turne cleane away their eye And play the tyrants; then all utterly Is rent and raz'd; no place for equity Is to be found; the treasures goe to nought, And they at last find deare their pleasures bought Ecclipsed they of all their majesty With broken scepters on the ground doe lye; But yee your gold for gods doe well imploy, The fruits thereof shall comfort be and joy; Your stately image which all men admire, Must by all men be worshipped with feare, If any will your image not adore The fierie furnace shall him soone devore. The Counsellers. Where kings rule well; O there from coast to coast The land it is as rings with pearles embost, The field abroad all shines with brightest beames The mountaines high doe spew cleare silver streames, The valleyes als are full of wine and corne; Great policie doth all the land adorne, Men live at home in peace, their crooked age Snowes not their locks in tedious pilgrimage: But when the princes looke both sterne and strange And cruelly doe give themselves to range And spoile the poore; neglecting justice beame With countenance fill'd with a pride extreame, That with great griefe the verie earth doth grone, The houses heere, and there, are lost alone. Men scorne the gods and also all that's said By counsellers who for such things are sad: Then topsie turvie all is turn'd at last For mirth is mourning and for feasts a fast: Then pride and lies doe banish faith and zeale The gods depart, and grace from common weale Doth take its leave: warre still doth bring great want It pulls up quickly all that peace doth plant But yee a prince of vertue knowe the price Ye good men raise, and raze men given to vice, Your mind is set gods to adorne aright With gold; ye shine like to a lanterne bright Set on a Phavos which by beames most bright From shipwrack saves these who doe saile by night: What others spend in Civet, Musk, and Amber Things of great price for to perfume their chamber, What others spend in drunkennesse extreame, Padling like frogs in Bachus purple streame What others spend when drumes they cause to beat For battells where men sweat with sweating heat That yee for gods have set on Duras plaine A golden image glorious to remaine, Doubtless the gods with great fertilitie Will guardon well your Liberalitie: If any will your image not adore The fierie Furnace shall him soone devore. The Sheriffes. The princes lewd make drink their darts with blood, Their sword they glut with slaughter; all the brood Of wicked race break forth, and make a song Of doolefull notes which sound the land along, The souldiers thus dispersed far from home Ov'r all the fields with cruelty doe roame, The prunning hookes are turned into speares, And sithes to swords, the land is fill'd with feares, The deepthes with pyrats, and the downes with theeves Are fill'd, so one mischeefe another weeves. But ye contemning all such rage so rare, Have for the gods set up ane image faire: Your subjects wrapped in soft beds doe sleep While others watches in cold trenches keep, While others rageing pierce the flesh and skine With lances sharp bristling like porcupin: While others make with swords in shivers flie Both casks and sculls, ye guide all quietlie, And of your subjects ye require no more; But that most humblie they the gods adore: Who you despise let them be at the last Bound hand and foot within a furnace cast. The Rulers of the Provinces. Who with contempt despise the God of Heav'n, Their payment shall in their owne coine be giv'n, Their subjects shall not faile them to despise, All men at last shall see how goes the guise: The Gods shall judgments send with noisles foot, Them to destroy and cut them branch and root: Against such hurts they have no cunning charmes When Gods doe thunder with imperious armes Which maugre all the force of men bring downe Their loftie lookes and scepter break and Crowne And cast them all into the mire or mud; Such judgements sleep not, but most quickly scud Upon the wings of wrath, while in the poups Of princes good, good fortune blowes with troupes Of blessings blessings running in a heap With such a course that they on other leap To blesse them all heere with refreshing balmes, And thew with laurelles and victorious palmes, And heere againe to glade them all their dayes With sweetest songs of lullabies and layes, That like deare babes in craddles laid to sleep Sweet rest anone through all their veines may creep: So yee doe well who gives this worthie pledge Of your good will to gods a worthy gadge Of finest gold set up in Duras field That all unto it worship due may yeeld: If any will your Image not adore The fierie furnace shall him soone devore. King Nebuchadnezzer. Good subjects when they see their prince affect A purpose good they willingly effect What he desires: it is a kings cheefe treasure To have still subjects for to doe his pleasure. What I doe threat or promise I not «sleap» slip It to observe, from trueth kings should not trip: To break his word it ill beseemes a king, Who as so speakes should still do every thing: Princes who are disloyall and unjust With wrath their subjects arme and with distrust: Princes who are in their wayes grave and sage Can easy calme a peoples barking rage: The kings who fierie speak words of boast most big Doe make their scepters like a Mapple twig, Except they joine with them th'authoritie Of noble Peers their folies men will see. So I intending for to make ane Image Would do nothing but by your counsell sage: Now seeing yee, who are the peeres, consent, Let us an Herauld send incontinent To publish to all people Nations all Whom we command even whether great or small, That when they heare Flut, Sackbut, psaltery, Harp, Dulcimer; they in humility Fall downe, and worship to this Image yeeld Which I set up have in faire Duras field: Who so doth fail to bow upon his face The same hour shall be burnt with great disgrace; If men praise kings lawes can not abide, The fierie furnace shall their doubts decide. The Princes. Your majestie in this your wise desire Doe nothing but great equitie require: Wee shall a Herauld find without delay Who quickly shall in all things you obey. Ho such a one, anone goe back your steed, And heere and there see that you runne with speed Declaring that this is the kings decree That all his liedges in humilitie When sackbut they or psaltery shall heare Must worship with great reverence and feare The golden Image a most precious thing In Duras field high set up by the King. The Kings Herauld. Good Heraulds are like birds upon a twig Which nimbly still doe hop from sprig to sprig And with their warbling shame the Cuckow notes, By sounding sweetly with their swelled throats: What yee command it is most just indeed, And I the same will execute with speed Ho, ho, Ho, ho, Let every man give eare, When Kings command the subjects then should heare: The King ordaines that now all Nations Who doe reside in his dominions When they heare Flut, Harp, Sackbut, psaltery Or Dulcimer, they in humility Fall downe and worship to the Image yeeld, Which by the king is set in Duras field: Who so doth faile to bow downe at the last Shall in a trice be in a furnace cast Of flaming fire where he shall be anone Burnt and consumed both in flesh and bone. The People. Sith King and Peeres this Image greatly love The peoples part is them for to approve: They are but fooles, yea too too malapart Who enterprise kings precepts to subvert: These who contemne that which they doe ordaine Deserve the fire, or to be shent in twaine; Wee promise all when wee shall heare the sound Of any musick; wee shall on the ground Fall humbly downe before this golden badge Made by the king with counsell grave and sage: The people in such things should not contest, But follow that their prince still counteth best. The Caldeans. Wee heere declare unto your majestie That certaine Jewes contemne what yee decree: Yee had ordain'd that when men heard the sound Of musick, they should downe fall to the ground To worship yor Image in Duras field, But certaine Jewes refuse alwayes to yeeld That which is due, our Lawes doe this require That such be burnt even in a flaming fire: These rebells who contemne you so and so Are Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego, Whom yee have made high for to rule alone The great affaires that are in Babylon. For nothing that the wisest men that live Can say to them will they now worship give. King Nebuchadnezzar. What, what is this? what tidings doe you bring? Dare any man stand up against the king And say, He will my precepts not obey? I now command that ye without delay Bring to me these proud fellowes who doe so Ev'n Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego. The Caldeans. At your command wee cheerely to the charge Shall go, and shall declare to them at large What is your will, wee knowe these proud precise Do not regard how they great kings may please. Ho Shadrach, ho, ye with your fellowes deare Ordained are with haste for to compeare Before the king; see that with haste yee hye And to him yeeld obedience by and by: Bewar that ye swolne with a sullen spight Cease to obey that which is just and right: Bewar that yee rebellion in your heart Brood, or yet workes what may your well subvert: What he commands that doe it cheerefullie Strike saile anone, come underneath his lee. Hee who on earth would live must surely learne To be still toghed at his royall sterne To follow him, and still to stand in awe, What he commands it must stand for a law. If ye refuse ye tremble shall all troubled With wrack and woe your dolours shall be doubled: Princes provoked have immortall rage, Their fierie fewd no floods at all can swage: The great in might still muster in their traine The souldiers fell who think it still their gaine Them to obey to save or yet to kill, It is their food their furie to fullfill: If more or lesse ye them refuse to please Within their heads stand burning coales for eyes, What say ye Shadrach and your fellowes deare, Are ye not willing quickly to compeare Before your prince that as of all his lands The subjects have; so yee may his commands Gladely receive, and quickly him obey In what's his will either to doe or say? What wee require now answer us anone, Let us now heare the answere of each one. Shadrach. Wee servants are of the great God of Heav'n Who for our sinnes us to this land hath driv'n Wherein wee captives have been ever since, We ever mind for to obey our prince In lawfull things; let all these surely smart That from his lawes would but an inch depart: These who in vertue and Gods feare excell Against their prince use not for to rebell These who are led to walk within his line Use not to plot or treasons for to twine Against their Leige; no force no shivring feare Should to his precepts make them stop their eare: Gods word doth teach us princes to obey And for their well continually to pray. Meshach Proud wicked hearts 'gainst Princes treasone coine And with their foes doe oft unjustly joine. Who them contemne doe surely spet at heaven Whose spettle shall in their own face be driven. Let kings be wise in vertue still sincere As als against all vices most severe, Then godly men them surely will obey And alwayes will for their protection pray. Abednego. Wee by Gods word are well instructed all, That princes whom on thrones God doth install Are gods whom ye doth set on seats suppreame Upon their heads to weare a Diademe: What they command, their subjects must obey If 'gainst the Lord they not their scepters sway. Who them contemne by work or yet by word Pale feare alwayes such hauty hearts shall guard Who would but cut the lappet of their coat Deserve to have their head cut from their throat: But by your favour let us understand What to be done the king will us command. The Caldeans. Goe heere and see, the king will soone declare What is his mind, and what his precepts «a??» are: Almighty prince ye knowe he is alway, They suffer shall who will not him obey. Great hoasts of men he hath brought very low Who flew in dust, in blood did after flow. Of nations none his forces could abide, Some fled for feare, and some themselves did hide: If ye would not of such great troubles taste Goe to the king and him obey in haste Bestir you quick to follow his command, Or yee shall feele his thunder-throwing hand. King Nebuchadnezzar. Come hither ye my princes and my peeres Consider me; who routed have with feares The nations all, and brought them very low Me to obey, and every knee to bow Unto mine image set in Duras plaine But some I heare this glorious work disdaine, Some factious men who wisper so and so Ev'n Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Behold them coming and hard at their back My Caldeans who surely are not slack To doe my will; when they my watches keep They never slumber, and they never sleep. Ho Shadrach, I for you look'd long ago And for you Meshach and Abednego: What's this I heare of you a number few? Can this be false, or shall I think it trew? Doe ye not serve my Gods and worship low The golden Image which I doe allow Stately to stand upon faire Duras plaine Dare ye be bold such homage to disdaine? Think yee yourselves of such a sp'rit divine As that my precepts ye dare countermine? Are ye so bold to whisper in the dark Or yet aloud 'gainst me to belch or bark, That it unlawfull alwayes seemes to be Before mine image for to bow the knee? If others so did jangle and debate They not reforme, but should deforme my state, If others were as ye are foolish rude They should me from the sacred Helme exclude. Yet for all this, I give you space and time Before us heere to purge you of this crime. Now quickly tell if that you readie be (when ye heare Cornet, Flut, Harp, psalterie, And Sackbut with sweet musick of all kind) Then for to worship with a humble mind This golden image a most stately thing Set up by me your Liege Lord and your king: If this ye doe, I say no more but well, My love from you I never will conceall: But if ye proud, precise, not stand in awe, Me to disdaine, and als to break my law, Not careing for that which I doe require, Ye in a furnace shall be burnt with fire. At you now Shadrach heere I will begine Speake out that I may knowe what is within Your breast, and after I will speak unto That Meschah als and to Abednego: Strive to obey your king in gentle sort Before he strike he rather would exhort: A king that's good is like to a cunning leach Who than destroy, had rather men beseech. Think ye not Shadrach but even when ye see Mine image, then ye may even bow the knee. If ye obey, well, there shall be no more, If not, a fire shall surely thee devore: Who is that God, who by his winged bands Can thee deliver from my mightie hands. Shadrach. We honour kings, but God we doe adore: But as for gold wee neither lesse nor more Acknowledge that of it ane image be Set up, to which a man should bow the knee; Who worship gold or silver, stones or stockes Doe shew themselves to be but senseless blocks: The wrath of God which still is burning hote Shall on them fling a flashing thunder shot This fire can burne both soule and flesh at once Your fire can onely burne the flesh and bones. Against the sinnes of such detested livers God shall his darts shoot from his wrathfull quivers: God is a spirit none saw him or can see, Unto him onely wee must bow the knee Him onely wee will worship and adore Take this for answere either lesse or more. Wee know all this and well doe understand That ye a King have a most mighty hand, In all that which doth to this life belong Upon the earth the sons of men among Your fauchins sharp, your hands of forces full With keenest edge can cutt and cleave the skull: Your furnace hote within a little time May burne the flesh and turne the bones to lime. But so it is that God who is above Can quickly from us dangers all remove: In Heavens above a mighty Lord we have Who can as well even from the furnace save: This well I knowe I not in darknesse groap, My feet are feathr'd with the wings of Hope He who this faith within his heart not feeles Let him in feare betake him to his heeles For to escape by sea, or yet by land For to avoide the furie of thine hand; Wee understand that God can, if he will, In fire or water keepe us safely still. Yea more I say, that thou may'st understand O king our God will surely from thine hand Deliver us; yet though he not preserve Us from the fire; thy Gods wee will not serve. King Nebuchadnezzar. Base naughtie stranger com'st thou hither thus In foolish wordes to prat, and preach to us? Within thy skull thy braine in flames most hote Shall boille and buble like a seething pot: So others shall by thine example learne To bound their zeale and als their furie sterne: Such fellowes proud who seem to be precise Their fantasies are onely set to please: Thy bloody tapes all railing to and fro Deserves to be cut out and burnt also, Or to be hang'd upon a gallows hye Meate for the Ravens who still porke porking cry This thou deserves, but fiercest fire for torture With quick dispatch shall make thy sorrows shorter. Ye princes who mine honour still regard Judge what this fellow should have for reward: Mine image he most proudly doth contemne, None of you all but ye will him condemne. The Princes. Men who are base can not well understand What is requir'd when great kings doe command. They strout in rage, themselves they onely please, Who 'gainst the lawes would seeme to be precise. Well ruled kingdomes should such men out spew None prouder is than a presumptuous Jew, A cursed crew, poor rascalls all in clouts Doe fill your kingdome with their needlesse doubts: If ye permit things to go so and so, Your throne anone will stagger to and fro: Let them who will not doe what ye require In furnace hot be scorched with a fire. The Governoures. Ambitious spirits the Tinder box of war Take pleasure still in something for to Jarr, That men may think that men of such a kind Are more then others of a heavenly mind: Thus wee who are in dignitie and place Oft by such meanes doe suffer great disgrace: What wonder sith such do not stand in aw To scorne their prince, and proudly break his law, Who in his heart could this but once suppose, That such a fellow should lift up his nose To face a prince, and to lift up his brow, With loftie lookes his fancies to allow? He thinks all others of a waxen mind Fit for each seale, and whirl'd with every wind, But he himselfe a mighty rock to be Which scornes the surges of the raging sea. Away with such in fashiones so preceise Who have no care their prince at all to please See how this fellow doth himselfe behave Who in distress did yerst remaine a slave: See how he stands in his right ruste of pride As who but he, who can such things abide? Thinks thou o man this but a little thing For to conspire against the Caldean king? Let them who will not doe what yee require In furnace hot be scorched with a fire. The Captaines. Stout captaines hardly can such fellowes heare And not their heads with bloody sheames besmeare Or rather gore, that others well may learne To princes great their dueties to discerne: If this companion could his will dispatch Our prince should soone be ane unsceptred wretch; His subjects should him hurrie up and downe Untill they should him at the last uncrowne; He who before was but a gallie slave Disdaines now Master, or yet match to have: Kings thrones with ladders he would scale and tak He souldier like the way beares on his back To climb with speede on his ambitions wall; But soone or since great pride doth catch a fall. See how he stands in all this great alarme He feareth not, becaus he feeles no harme. Let them who will not doe what ye require In furnace hot be scorched with a fire. The Judges. He who to Kings due honour great not gives Deserves like slaves the fetters and the Gyves: Who can abide that with insulting rust Vile rascalls should so 'gainst their princes pust? Behold a prince whom princes doe attend Who Chaldean Lands commands from end to end And many moe, and yet this fellow proud Against this prince dare thus so highly croud: Base fellowes of a naughtie rascall race, Doe not conceive the Majestie and place That's due to kings, whom all should greatly feare, As these who are indeede the godlings heere Most neere the gods, these who against them rude In dumbest thoughts rebell, should lose their bloode. Who 'gainst his prince dare onely speake a word Should in his heart have sheathed Justice sword. Let them who will not doe what ye require In furnace hot be scorched with a fire. The Treasurers. Kings troubled are with vaine and needless motions Most idle braines make often great commotions By naughtie things they trouble state and crowne That they thereby may purchase great renowne, And be esteem'd as if they were some gods Whereas indeede they merit sharpest rods. By proud conceits such trouble all the state And fill the land with strife and great debate The Caldean lands did never such men breed Who for good wheat give dizzie darnell seed: The Nations great by thy victorious troup Are forc'd unto thy standarts low to stoup. What are these fellowes with ambitious rage? Cause bind them fast and cast them in a cage; Bind up their mouthes full of such surely speach Let them now knowe how farr your power doth reach: If they thus tosse your kingdomes for their pleasure Wee treasurers will have ane empty treasure: Let them who will not doe what yee require In furnace hote be scorched with a fire. The Rulers of the Provinces. See how vaine fellowes as with furious waves Would overwhelme great men as naughtie slaves By their conceits; If all things be not so Even as they think, all upside downe must goe, While melancholious in a drousie fit Deviseing folies they in chambers sit, They fertile are devices for to brood Which ever still tend unto strife and blood: If such obtaine their foolish hearts desire They care not all be spoil'd with sword and fire: What recks it them that with a scarlet robe Of blood, men be all cloath'd and sigh and sob? If they be safe of dread and danger free, They care not for the greatest prodigie That can befall; the choisest way to war Is that which makes the king with subjects jar. How dar such men when they the kings decree From Heraulds heare thus disobedient be? Let them who will not doe what yee require In furnace hot be scorched with a fire. King Nebuchadnezzar. Pride in the heart most fearefull workeings hath It makes men soare aloft and leave the path Of duties all which to a prince are due In Caldea of such there be not a few: Behold how Shadrach in his fancie wise Me and mine image basely doth despise: This ye have heard and als have clearely seene He in his cariage vaine and proud hath beene. Though I be prince, he me doth not regard, Let him stand by till he get his reward: It is your mind that after my desire In furnace hote he be consum'd with fire. Ho Meshach come it may be that now ye Your prince to serve, than he more willing be; Be not like Shadrach who is set for strife, Kneele and obey, if ye would save your life: Ane Image faire on Duras field doth stand Bow it before, I only this demand, If thou obey, well, there shall be no more, If not, a fire shall surely thee devore. Who is that God who by his winged bands Can thee preserve from my most mightie hands. Meschach. I willing shall you serve in every thing, Who feares the Lord will honour als the King Whom God to sit on highest Thrones doth chuse Him to obey none should at all refuse If so that he Gods will doth understand And precepts give which God als doth command. But if the Prince in wickednesse be bold Though cloath'd with stuff stift with fine beaten gold, And rough with Rubies, this must be our care To serve the Lord, whose servants still wee are; If in the way to Heavens wee would not erre, Wee still the Lord must unto men preferre In every thing, yea whether lesse or more None but madde fooles do gold for God adore. Gold is but earth nothing it has divine— Though by the Artist it be chekker'd fine: Vaine carnall men may with their simple wit With tooles a lump into ane image fit; But what is there, yea either lesse or more That men should stoup such dead things to adore? Why should a man even any comfort seeke From golden mouthes which have no tongue to speake? Who can imagine comfort for to find From that which is both deafe, and dumb, and blind? He not deserves a comfort for to have Who unto dead things makes himself a slave. Now knowe, o King, thy Gods wee will not serve We trust in God, who can us well preserve And though he should not, yet most surely wee Unto thine image will not bow the knee. King Nebuchadnezzar. Base naughtie slaves, I shall a judgement ample Bring on you soone to make you ane example To all my subjects; surely for your crime Your flesh and bones shall all be burnt to lime; Becaus that ye contemners are of Princes Yee suffer shall the fire with all your senses: I mind such doings timeously to snib, Lest that my lawes seeme like a spiders web. Vaine foolish men with their most curious wits Doe stint their studies as their furie fits, Such willinglie will seeme to suffer paine, To vent the follies of their idle braine To get on earth a glorious gilded name That so they may be counted men of fame But I thee shall teach in another path To walk when thou the furie of my wrath Shalt feele in fire, which for thy faults anone Shall scorch thy flesh, and also burne thy bone. Ye Princes who mine honour still regard Judge what this fellow should have for reward, Mine image he most proudly doth contemne, None of you all but yee will him condemne, Though I your Liege Lord none at all doe feare, Yet what's your mind I now desire to heare. The Princes. No banks at all your fames great sea can bound, Your temples are with Lawrells richly crown'd With majestie, ye dwell in stately towres The highest sprite before you humbly cowres Except these villaines faggots for your fire Whose hearts are dampt and dimm'd with proud desire For to be something in some mans account Maugre your might, but yee will soone surmount Their foolish pride; these naughty stubborne fooles At furnace mouth will soone lay downe the tooles Of all their pride, though they be stout in word The sight of fire with feare their hearts shall gird Then they anone shall soone forget to reason When they shall feele what hath deserv'd their treason: These fooles not knowe the heav'nly milkin way Wherein shall shine most brightly night &amp; day All those who humbly still doe set their heart From lawes of kings a jot not to depart. But ye Sir who have such strong Regiments At all times ready round about your tents Ye who doe shine adorn'd with gold and gems In purple cloath'd and crown'd with Diademes Your kingdomes maugre times most wastfull rages Have lasted still so many yeeres and ages, Yee need not feare a Traitours treacherous drift Though foolishly he for a space uplift Himself against his prince for to rebell, How easie is't such rascalls to expell, To hang, to head, or if ye doe desire Them quick to burne with scorching flaming fire? Base naughty sp'rits not knowe what well becomes Great princes who doe sit in glorious roomes With sword in hand, and who doe scepters sway With power to force all rebells to obey: If yee such things away let slip or slide Unbridledly with such a furious tide, Ye shall at last find that your majestie By others als may soone contemned be Who lusks in downes and lookes not well abroad To curb in time corruption with a rod, It may spring up from twig unto a tree, Great rivers from most small beginnings be. This we not speake for lucre, but for love Let fierie flames such rebells soon remove. The Governours. The sprits of men are flitting whiles and floating Whiles on their fancies they are dully dotting: It seemes to them that they see things most cleare And yet right farr debard from their Careere, Not knowing what to princes great belongs When they in pride provoke by daily wrongs This senselesse fellow with his companie Feares not to belch against your majestie, Whose glory great like to a shining starr Makes eyes to dazell whether neere or farre Pride makes him snort on pillows of security, And also sport as though ye for impurity Not worthy were to sit upon a throne, But that from thence ye should be hurl'd anone; Who have the soundest and the sharpest eye, What I now say, they may it clearely see. But tary till the flame shall sing his haire And scorch his flesh till all his flesh be bare, Then shall he howle, or give some heavy sob That he his prince of glory due did rob; Then shall he knowe that yee did foully slide When flames shall scorch his back, his breast, his side Within the furnace, fire most fierce and fell Shall loudly make him for to yawne and yell: Spare not the coales, it onely is the best, Nothing but fire is for so proud a crest: If these ye spare who darnell are and tares Yee shall anone be fill'd with costly cares: Your cords of strength your subjects shall untwine, One shall rebell, another shall repine: Make yee your subjects tremble all for awe, Let every wink still serve them for a law Make all men feare so that no bush or brake May hide the man who dare but undertake To winke amisse against what yee command, Make so men all your power to understand. If ye permit rebellion on such props To goe; anone shall fall the airie tops Of all your towres; If fellowes thus combine They'll break the mastick of all love divine And humane als, and so as with a thunder The bands of dueties will breake all asunder When once a people moved is with rage With new conceits then hardly shall ye swage Their furious rage by any proclamation, So are mens sprits still, set for innovation What wee now say it is to you for love Let fierie flames these rebells all remove. The Captaines. If yee of grace and goodnesse were not full Yee could not suffer so this churlish gull Whose furie no respect at all can bound To honour such that have their temples crown'd With laurells greene; such fellowes now alone Contemne your Crowne, your scepter, and your throne, Your majestie must hencefoorth take good heed, Such rebells vaine for to represse with speede; Lest afterward maugre your might or will They all your lands with high rebellion fill: Wee captaines bold will not now spare our blood You to maintaine, and to procure your good With stately tropheis wee your state will feed And will maintaine your crownes upon your head: When ye are wrong'd our sword like chearefull balmes Shall cure your wounds, wee with victorious palmes Will you decore, wee shall make mountaines stoup And hills all tremble with high horned top, Wee at your service shall make no delay, Onely command and wee shall cause obey, These fellowes proud no strength have but in word But wee are men for targets, speares, and swordes, When feeble hearts perceive us armed come A shiv'ring feare doth then their soule benumme, And freeze their senses or dissolve them all From vaine conceits till at the last they fall Downe at the feet of those who doe command Both great and small that are in all the land: These painted tombs who seem their God to love And you to scorne, who can them well approve? Great danger is when as a sparkle small But by mischance doth into powder fall, Then all's afire; the flamme it by degrees From place to place in a combustion flees; As it goes on, the greater is its force, So such conceits the subjects will divorce From king and lawes except that speedilie By strictest statuts such still curved be. To be obey'd Sir be ye constant still, For your great worth shall not want our good will: Among best wits ye have a worthy place All you respect, fooles onely would disgrace Your royall precepts; If ye grant permission Wee shall then cause abandon their rebellion: Wee Captaines stout shall by a mighty hand Anone atchieve whatever ye shall command. Away with them, let pitchie clouds of smoak Them in a furnace altogether choak. It pleasure is faire banners to display To goe to war to fight in battell ray 'Gainst men of worth who have both hearts and hands But what! all these who come from other lands Are captives base, a shame and a disgrace That were a prince they should at all have place; These captive slaves to speake it in a word Not worthie are to perish by our sword: Wee would think shame in flesh of rascalls vile Our fauchins bright so basely to defile; Such in a fierie furnace cast anone That all may learne to stoup before your throne. The Judges. The braines of men are fill'd with tales and toyes A curious head the countrey all annoyes: By foolish men who take delight to jarre Wee judges with our prince still troubled are: These who doe flaunt in silver, silk, and gold To scorne their prince darre never be so bold As Rascalls vile, who readie are anone To vilipend Kings sitting on their throne: None, as the think, but they, the truth can find, While as indeed such are but Beetle blind; Fy, fy, that wee who sit on Judgments seats Should spend our time once for to speake of threats 'Gainst villaines vile who boldly dare gain stand The princes Lawes obey'd by all the land. Such in a fierie Furnace cast anone That all may learne to stoope before your throne. The Treasurers. Vaine fellowes pensive still doe studie nought, But how t'accomplish their proud foolish thought, And tremble all with their opinions vaine, As though men might the Lawes of Kings disdaine: Such naughtie fellowes by a needlesse jarre, Prepare the way unto a bloody warre, For when some few «break» ov'r the lists of law, Their ill example soone doth others draw Against their Liege Lord proudly to rebell Whereby the state and all they quickly quell: So wee who happie and most hopefull were To gather treasures are deceived farre: Soo wee at last get even this for a curse, For treasures great wee have ane empty purse. O happy they who stand as sentinell At all times ready for the common well! O happy they, who being put to tryall Unto their princes are all still found loyall, And spare not for the publick toile to take That they the state may all to flourish make! When this doth lake when men of quirks all full By fraud and guile the simple sort doe gull When others vaine in no way can forbeare Like foolish Buffons for to flirt and jeere And scorne the weake with most delightfull notes, Then men become brute like vile Hogs or Goats: But as for these who should without delay Obey their prince and yet goe still away With proud contempt, and a lofty gingling As though their knowledge were no little beameling, But even a sun with brightnesse by and by For to enlighten all the upper sky And heere and there most glorious all to glance Through all the globe to make an influence By such a pride they like the grunting hog Doe feed on filth, or like the loathsome frog Ly in the mires and there still croaking they Doe bore their neighboures both by night and day When all's in peace then all like golden spangles Most nimbly dances, or like fruit that dangles. But o contentions still doe bring a curse All treasurers in wars have empty purse This is our feare I think this fellowes bread Hath not been wheat but dizzie darnell seed. Thinks he in Babell safely for to dwell And proudly thus against the king rebell? O king yee have a most victorious troup Which able is to caus such fellowes stoup. Such in a fierie Furnace cast anone That all may learne to bow before your throne. The Counsellours. Who to obey their princes will not joine May seeme fine gold, yet are but copper coine: Who to his prince is farre or neere a foe Most curs'd he is, and should be called so: When fell discord comes from her loathsome cage She blowes her poison with ambitious rage From hand to hand, nothing she doth require But that the land blaze like a ball of fire: If subjects seeke for to shake off the yoke Then sure the state upon some noisome rocke May soone make shipwrack; oh then what can «stand» stay The state and all for to be made a prey? Men swell with rage, and prank with proud despight, Not aw, not law, not faith they reak, nor right, Then altogether they in cruell thirst, Shall swill their fill of blood untill they brust: So through the land one stirr'd against another Shall goe to swordes and butcher each his brother. Nothing but blood and burning men shall see If from the sterne yee take authoritie; The surges must the ship soone overwhelme If from the pilot ye bereave the helme If men goe on and wicked deeds dispatch Untill their king be ane unsceptred wretch, Then cities sack'd and wealthie subjects pill'd Then women ravisht and much men are kill'd: So when at last these dueties become failling, Nothing is heard but mourning and bewailling:</field>
