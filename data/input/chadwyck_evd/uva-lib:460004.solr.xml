      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Royal Pavilion. Hellena on a Sofa in a Melancholy Posture. Cleora attending near her. Eunuchs, Mutes, Singers and Dancers. SONG. The Regent of Night with her Beams Had chequer'd each Valley and Grove, And swell'd with her Influence the Streams, When Fatima, pining for Love; To the Ocean, Despair for her Guide, Repaired for Relief from her Pain; Where plunging, receive me, she cried, I'm fair, young and royal in vain. Hellena rises and comes forward. Hel. No more, Cleora! I accept thy Love, But thy officious Kindness is in vain. It is not Musick, nor the sprightly Dance, The Harmony of Motion, or of Sound, That can asswage my Grief. Cle. Let all retire. (Exeunt Eunuchs, &amp;c. How long, my Royal Mistress! will you sooth This secret, pining Grief? How long averse To ev'ry Dawn of Joy, thus seek Retirement; And shun the gay Delights, the Pomp and Power, That ever wait the Daughter of our Sultan, And first of Womankind? Hel. How long shall Love And torturing Despair, like ling'ring Fevers, Feed on the Springs of Life, and drink my Blood? How long shall Amurath, my awful Father, Tho' press'd and overwhelm'd with Disappointments, Provoke the Malice of his adverse Stars, And urge his own Destruction; whilst in vain With unrelenting Hatred he pursues, Whom Heav'n protects, th'ever victorious Hero Of Epirus. Cle. Thus do you always talk, Of Love and Death, Despair and the Epirot. Why will you ever strive to hide the Cause, The cruel Cause of all this mighty Anguish? Believe me, Princess! 'tis better to intrust A faithful Slave, than keep the Secret thus To rack your Breast; 'twill ease those Painsâ Hel. That Death Alone can cure; but yet, my best Cleora! Such is thy Truth, thy Tenderness and Love, I can deny thee nought. Yes, thou shalt know All thou desir'st, and share the very Heart Of sad Hellena.âYou must think I love.â What else cou'd make thy Princess far more wretched Than the meanest Slave, and who but Castriot Cou'd merit so sublime a Flame as mine? Cle. 'Tis as I fear'd: She's lost beyond Redemption. (Aside. Hel. A Royal Hostage to my Father's Court When young he came, who loved him as a Son; I as a Brother; so I fondly thought, Nor found my Error, 'till the fatal Flame, That now consumes me, cherish'd by my Weakness, Was grown too great, too fierce to be controll'd. O matchless Prince! who can display thy Worth? Thou Favourite of Heav'n, and first of Men; In Courts more soft, more lovely, more attractive Than those fair Youths who with eternal Bloom Injoy the fragrant Mansions of the Blest; In Council wiser than a whole Divan; In Anger awful; and in War as fierce As those bright Ministers, whom Heav'n sends forth To punish the presuming Sons of Men; In Justice th' Image of that Sacred Power, Whom he still serves with most unfeign'd Devotion; Like him in Mercy too, in Bounty like him; Excelling in Magnificence the Princes Of th' East, yet temperate and self-denying As a Dervise.âWho know, and Love thee not, Avow their Malice and Contempt of Virtue. Cle. Think, Princess! think what 'tis you say; of whom It is you speak. Can he, that cruel Christian, That Enemy t'our Prophet and your Father, Deserve such Praise from You? Hel. Unjust Cleora! To call him cruelâBut thou know'st him not; Or sure thy gentle Nature wou'd abhor To wrong him thus. And wherefore dost thou urge His diff'rent Faith to me? Love busies not Himself with reconciling Creeds, nor heeds The Jarrings of contentious Priests: from Courts To Shades, from Shades to Courts he flies To conquer Hearts, and overthrow Distinction, Treating alike the Monarch and the Slave; But shuns the noisy School, and leaves the Race Of proud, litigious Men to their own Folly; Who wise in Words alone, consume their Days In fierce Debate, nor know the End of Life. Cle. Now I no longer wonder you contemn'd Amasie and his Flame. Hel. O Name him not, The most detested Traytor; who, tho' next In Blood, and late the dearest Friend of his Indulgent Prince, without a Cause renounc'd His Faith, his Country and his vow'd Allegiance. Cle. Say not without a Cause, his Love to youâ Hel. Insolent Slave! Ambitious, bloody Traytor! To claim my Love for Cruelty and Fraud! Must I have been a Recompense for Murther! For Regicide, the Murther of his King! But his Defeat has freed me from that Danger: My Father now retracts his former Promise, And treats him with Aversion and Contempt. Cle. May Treason ever meet the like Reward.â But see the Man we speak of comes this Way. Hel. I wou'd avoid him, do thou hear his Message; His Name is hateful, but whene'er I see him, My Blood runs back, my Sinews all relax, And Life itself seems ready to forsake me. [Exit Hellena. Enter Amasie. Cle. What wou'd you Prince? Ama. I am inform'd the Sultan Past this way, and came in Hopes to have found him With the Princess. Cle. Your Hopes deceiv'd you Sir. Ama. May I not see The Princess? Cle. No. Ama. I bring her happy News. Cle. Nor Happiness, nor Truth can come from Thee; For ev'ry Word, and ev'ry Thought of thine Are full of deep Deceit, and threaten Mischief. [Exit Cleora. Amasie alone. Seen and avoided!ârated by her Slave!â Suspected by the Sultan!âScorn'd by all!â Is this the Gratitude of Turkish Courts? This my Reward for Heav'n and Honour lost?â Soul poisoning Envy, eldest Born of Hell, Thou Sin of Devils, and their Torment too, To what Contempt, what Mis'ry hast thou brought Me? Ill-tim'd Reflection!âI shall still succeedâ Love and Ambition, Hatred and Revengeâ There's not a Wish my restless Soul has form'd, But shall be quickly crown'dâThen whence this Anguish? Sure 'tis much harder to attain Perfection In Ill, than to be truly Good.âThe Sultan!â Enter Amurath and Visier. Am. Away; my Fame is lost; my Laurels won With Pain and Toil and water'd with my Blood, That well I hop'd wou'd flourish o'er my Grave When I that planted them shou'd be but Dust, Are wither'd all. O! wherefore did I tempt, In the declining Winter of my Age, The Vigour of a youthful Rebel's Arms? Whose curst Success, 'gainst such prodigious odds, Makes Credibility doubt what she sees, And Truth appear like Falsehood. Ama. Mighty Sultan!â Am. What woud'st thou, Slave! Thou Renegade, thou Spy! Hence from my Sight: avant, perfidious Traytor. Vis. My ever gracious Lord, you wrong the Prince; None can be more devoted to your Service. Am. 'Tis false. Did he not lead my Spahies forth With Hate profest, and Boasts of sure Revenge On Scanderbeg; then leave my gallant Troops To swell the Triumph, and to glut the Rage Of that damn'd, damn'd Destroyer of the Faithfull. Vis. O righteous Heav'n! when will thy Judgments cease? For Six revolving Moons have we in vain Besieg'd yon City, proud, imperious Croia; With Famine, Pestilence, and Scanderbeg More terrible than both, like threat'ning Meteors, Hov'ring o'er our Heads. Our Strengths consum'd: By painful Watchings and incessant Toils Do not our Numbers ev'ry Hour decrease? Are we not all devoted to Destruction? Those that escape the Plague, of Hunger die; Or sav'd from Famine, perish by the Sword. Yet to behold you thus, burning with Rage, And tortur'd by Despair, afflicts us worse Than all our other Griefs. Why will you still refuse The only Help your present State admits, That Sov'reign Balm for Minds like yours diseas'd, And cure for ev'ry IllâAll healing Patience. Am. Name Patience again while th' Epirot lives And lives victorious, and thou art thyself A base, insulting Traytor. Hear me, Allah, If thou art ought beside an empty Name, If thou dost still exist, as Priests affirm, Decree our Fate, and govern all below, Behold, and aid a Cause so much your own. To Slaves, to Subjects and to Priests give Patience, But if it be within your Power to grant Ought that is worthy of a Monarch's Prayer, Give me Revenge, or I'll renounce thy Worship. (Shouts. Ha! whence those loud, those joyful Acclamations. Ama. But that it pleas'd my Lord to strike me dumb, I had ere this inform'd him of the Cause. Just Heav'n, at length indulgent to your Wishes, Has blest you with the power to end our Woes, Or wreck your Vengeance on the Man you hate. Am. Ha! what say'st thou? take heed thou triflest not: A second Time thou'st rais'd my Expectation; If thou deceiv'st it now, as at the first, Death is the lightest Ill thou hast to fear: But if, beyond my Hopes, thou tell'st me Truth, Thou shalt no longer droop beneath our Frown, (Your Service slighted, and your Love despis'd;) Our former lavish Grant shall be renew'd, And my Hellena, be thy rich Reward. Ama. (Kneeling) Bounty immense! thus Letâ Am. Rise, and proceed; Make it appear that Vengeance may be had; Let it be merely possible,âO Allah! I ask no more,âand leave the rest to me. Ama. Ever Invincible, your'e not to learn That Aranthes, Prince of Durazzo, who derives His high Descent from Charlemain, that most Illustrious Frank, Santon and King; has long Approv'd himself aspiring Castriot's Friend, And firm Ally. His Wisdom, Wealth and Power May well indear him to that haughty Rebel; But yet a Tie much stronger binds their Friendship: The Fair Althea, Daughter to Aranthes, Beholds the youthful Conqueror her Slave: Nor are his ardent Vows prefer'd in vain; With conscious Virtue, join'd with true Affection, With Majesty and Mildness sweetly temper'd, The charming Maid (for all who see her must Confess her Charms,) returns his constant Flame. This Friend and Mistress, the Partner and hoped Reward of all his Toils, are in your Power. Am. Prophet, thou'rt just; where are his Conquests now? Anguish has left my Soul to live in his. Perhaps ere this the News has reach'd his Ears. His promis'd Joys are come to swell my Heart; I have 'em all, but doubled by his Pain. Haste and inform us by what means, Amasie, These precious Pledges came into our Hands. Ama. This Morning from Durrazzo they set forth, Slightly attended for the Christian Camp, Fearing no Danger; for they knew your Army Had been for Months immur'd within these Plains; The Neighb'ring Mountains being all possest By their rebellious Minion's conquering Troops. Of this inform'd, not daring to approach Your sacred Presence, I inform'd your Son, Your Empire's second Hope, the brave Prince Mahomet. Strait with two thousand Horse guided by Me, Who, as a Native here, best new the Route The little Troop must take; he left the Trenchers: The Foe was quickly found; tho' few in Number They yet resisted long, and dearly sold Their Liberty or Lives: Aranthes last Yielded himself and Daughter to our Power. (Shouts. Enter Mahomet, Aranthes, Althea, Lords and Ladies in Chains. Ma. Long live great Amurath, my Royal Father; O may his Days for Ages yet roll on, And ev'ry Day encrease his Fame like this! Am. Rise to my Arms; thou bring'st me Life and Fame, And what my Soul much more desir'd, Revenge. When from the Womb they brought thee to these Arms, The first dear Fruit of my Maria's Love And Heir to all my Kingdoms; ev'n then I claps'd thee with less Joy, than at this Moment.â But let us view the Captives thou has brought. Now by our Prophet's Head, a noble Troop; A fairer Purchase never grac'd my Arms. This must be Aranthes, and this his Daughter. They seem to scorn their Fortune: Conscious Majesty Frowns on his Brow, and Beauty smiles on hers. Proud Christian, now where is your Propher's Power? Ar. Where it was ever, Sultan;âin himself. Am. If it be such as vainly you suppose, Why art thou fallen thus beneath my Power? Whose Eyes ne'er pitied, and whose Hand ne'er spar'd The Follow'rs of his Sect. Ar. Presumptuous Man! Shall finite Knowledge tax eternal Wisdom? Or shameless Guilt dare, with invidious Eyes, To search for Spots in Purity itself, And call impartial Justice to Account? Impious and vain! It is enough we know Such is his Will, who orders all Things right, To make ev'n these thy Chains, insulting King, Easy to us; and well content we bear 'em. Am. Ill doth it suit with your reputed Wisdom T'abet a rash rebellious Boy. Ar. Rebellious! By the heroick Virtue of the Youth, And more th'eternal Justice of our Cause, I must retort the Charge. Since first the Angels By their Ambition fell; the greatest Rebels, The most accurs'd, perfidious and ungrateful, Are those, who have abus'd the Sovereign Power. Why shines the Sun, why do the Seasons change, The teeming Earth lavish her yearly Store, And all to bless the Sons of Men in vain? O! is it not that Tyranny prevails And the true End of Government is lost; That those, who shou'd defend each in his Right, Betray their Trust, and seize upon the Whole. This, this is to rebel against that Power, By which Kings reign, and turn the Arms of Heaven Against itself. Then take the Rebel back, A virtuous Prince, the Patron of Mankind, With just Contempt may hear a lawless Tyrant Arraign that Conduct, which condemns his own. Am. 'Tis hard to say whether thy Insolence, Who tho' in Chains, dar'st brave me to my Face, Or the unprincely Meanness of thy Soul, Who wou'd by Law restrain the Will of Kings, Amaze me most. Let Scanderbeg and You, Like Fools contend, and shed your Blood in vain, While Subjects reap the Harvest of your Toil; O'ercome, that you may live the Slave of Slaves; I fight to reign, and conquer for myself. Ar. A gen'rous Slave wou'd scorn the abject Thought, What shou'd a King do then? Am. Think like a King, Whose Glory is his Power. Ar. Of doing Good. Am. Of doing what he will; the other's none. Ar. Has Heav'n no Power because it doth no Ill? Am. Were these the Thoughts of other Christian Princes, Wou'd they stand neuter, and unmov'd behold Th' Epirot and thyself sustain this War; Nor lend you their Assistance? Ar. Foul Dishonour! O everlasting Shame! Wou'd they unite, Afflicted Europe wou'd no longer groan Beneath your Yoke and mourn her Freedom lost: Nor Verna's nor Basilia's fatal Fields Smoke with the Blood of Christians unreveng'd: But to the Scandal of our Holy Faith, Some such there are, who owe their very Lives, Their Peace and Safety to the Blood of others, Yet think themselves born for themselves alone. Am. 'Tis time to quit a Cause so ill supported; And your Misfortunes may inform your Friend, What sure Destruction waits the desp'rate Wretch, That tempts his Wrath, who rules o'er half Mankind, And strikes the rest with Terror at his Name. Ar. Cease thy vain Boasts, and by Example learn The frail uncertain State of human Greatness. Where are now th' Assyrians, where the Medes; The Persians and their Conquerors, the Greeks; Or the stupendous Power of ancient Rome? Has not the Breath of Time blasted their Pride, And laid their Glory waste? Am. I need not boast T'assert my Power o'er thee. And yet perhaps On Scanderbeg's Submission we may grant Your Freedom, and vouchsafe to give him Peace. Ar. If by Submission vainly you design Dishonourable Terms, a shameful Peace, Give up such Thoughts; those his great Soul must scorn; Nor wou'd we be redeem'd at such a Price: Hope not to triumph over him in us. Am. Where is the Majesty that us'd to awe. My trembling Slaves? Art thou in Love with Death? Ar. No; nor with Life, when purchased at th'Expence Of others Happiness, or my own Honour. Am. Behold this Maid, this Comfort of thy Age. I, as a Father, know what 'tis to love A Child like thisâI have been deem'd a Man, A brave one tooâThe Fair, sacred to Peace, Have never yet been number'd with my Foes: But if presumptuously thou dost dispute Thy own and Daughter's Ransom on my Terms; Or teach thy Pupil to oppose my Will, Renounce me, Heav'n, if like thy bloody Priests, Those consecrated Murtherers of thy Sect, I cast not off all Bowels of Compassion, All Pity, all RemorseâHer tender Sex, Her Youth, her blooming Beauty shall not save her. Away; I'll hear no more. Prudence may yet Instruct you to avoid th'impending Ruin. Amasie, we commit him to your Charge. Al. O my Father! tho' torn from your Embraces, Your Precepts, your Example shall be ever Present with Althea; in Doubts my Guide, In Troubles my Support. Ar. This wounds indeed. 'Tis hard to part and leave her thus expos'd; But Heav'n must be obey'd. (Aside.) Farewell my Child Tho' Reason and Religion teach us Patience Pain will be felt and Nature have her Course. (Aside. (Exit Aranthes. Am. Mourn not bright Maid; you can have nought to fear: A Father and a Lover rule your Fate. Al. I see and scorn your Arts insidious King: And for your Threats, pursue 'em when you dare; Your Pride to see your Cruelty despis'd, Shall give you greater Pain than you inflict, And turn your Rage to Shame, O Prince belov'd! O my affianc'd Lord! let not my Danger One Moment stop the Progress of your Arms: I have my Wish if dying I may share In your Renown, and justify your Choice. Am. Osmin, attend the Lady to Hellena. [Exit Amurath, &amp;c. Vis. Fair Princess, you shall know no more Restraint Than what is common to the Sex with us. Al. Lead me to instant Death, or let me groan Whole Years in Chainsâdispose me as you pleaseâ Tho' my lov'd Sire and Lord no more I see, You hope in vain to conquer them in me.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Plain the whole Length of the Stage. One Side lined with Christian, the other with Turkish Soldiers. Enter Visier and Paulinus. Vis. Already has the Trumpet's lofty Sound From either Camp twice eccho'd thro' the Plain; At the third Summons both the Kings appear. May gracious Heav'n, in Pity to Mankind, Incline their Breasts to sheath the Sword, to stop The Tide of Blood, and give the World repose. Paul. What may we not expect from such a Treaty? And yet the Caution us'd on either Side To guard against Surprize, betrays Distrust. Vis. A thousand Injuries, suppos'd or real, With keen Resentment whet each jealous Chief, And seem to urge Suspicion. Paul. Scipio, And the fierce African, whom he subdu'd, With greater Ardor never strove t'attain For Rome, or Carthage, universal Sway; Than your great Sultan to impose the Yoke Of Arbitrary Power and make Men Slaves; Or our brave Prince to guard their Liberties, Or break their Chains and purchase Freedom for 'em. Vis. Then their known Zeal for their respective Faith Must yet much farther alienate their Minds. Paul. 'Tis hardly to be thought a youthful Hero, With Victories replete, will stoop to take Abject Conditions from a beaten Foe. Vis. Or that an artful Prince will fail t'improve Ev'ry Advantage to increase his Power. Paul. Fortune stands neuter, and impartial Heaven Holds with an equal Hand the trembling Beam: Superior Wisdom, Fortitude, and Courage Must turn the Scale. (Trumpets.) But see their Guards appear. The great Intelligencies that inform The Planetary Worlds, if such there be, With all their vast Experience might attend This Interview, and pass improv'd away. Enter Amurath, Scanderbeg, Mahomet, Aranthes, Amasie, &amp;c. Am. Doth it not swell thy fond, ambitious Heart? Dost thou not burst with Pride, vain Boy, to see The Majesty of hoary Amurath, Whose numerous Years are fewer than his Conquests, Reduc'd to Terms, and stoop to treat with thee? Scan. With Gratitude and Wonder I confess Myself th' unworthy Instrument of Heaven, To scourge thy Falshood, Cruelty and Pride, And free a Virtuous People from thy Chains. With Pity I behold your fierce Impatience, Your Arrogance and Scorn; ev'n while the Hand Of righteous Heaven is heavy on thy Crimes, And deals thee forth a Portion of those Woes, Which thy relentless Heart, with lawless Lust And never sated Avarice of Power, Has spread o'er half the habitable Earth. Am. And must I answer to thy bold Impeachment? Thou Infidel relasp'd! thou very Christian! Without Distinction and without a Name But what implies thy Guilt. In vain thy Flatt'rers Proclaim thee King of Macedon, Epirus, Illyria, Albania and Dalmatia; Gain'd by Surprize, by Treachery and Fraud; What art thou but the more exalted Traytor? Scan. Let abject Minds, the Slaves of mean Ambition, Affect vain Titles and external Pomp! And take the Shadow for substantial Glory. Superior Birth, unmerited Success, The Name of Prince, of Conqueror and King, Are Gifts of Fortune and of little Worth. They may be, and too often are, possest By sordid Souls, who know no Joy but Wealth; By ri'tous Fools, or Tyrants drench'd in Blood; A CrÃ¦sus, Alexander, or a Nero. The Best are sure the greatest of Mankind. Our Actions form our Characters. Let me Approve myself a Christian and a Soldier, And Flatt'ry cannot add, or Envy take Ought that I wish to have, or fear to lose. Am. Canst thou behold unmov'd, thou steady Traytor, Thy most munificent and loving Patron, Prest with the Weight of more than fourscore Years, With feeble Hands compell'd to reassume The stubborn Reins of Power, and taste again, When Appetite is pall'd, the bitter Sweets Of Sovereign Command? Shou'd I descend To reason with thee, what cou'dst thou reply? Have I not been a Father to thy Youth? Did I not early form thy Mind to Greatness, And teach thy Infant Hands the Use of Arms? Tho' the unerring Maxims of our State, (The only Rule of Right and Wrong in Courts) Had mark'd thee for Destruction; still I spar'd thee. Trusted, belov'd, advanc'd thou hast betray'd me. First seiz'd the Provinces you call'd your own, Then join'd my Foes to rob me of my Fame; The perjur'd Uladislaus, fierce Hunniades, And the Venetians, who have since forsook thee. Tho' to remote Magnesia I retir'd, Quitting the Toils of Empire to my Son, To seek for Rest and find a peaceful Grave; Yet there the Cries and Clamours of my Slaves, Who fled the Terrors of thy dreadful Name, Forbad their old o'erlabour'd King Repose; Forc'd me once more in hostile Steel to cloth These weary Limbs, and rouse to their Defence. But that thy Soul is lost to all Remorse Thy black Ingratitude must fright thyself? Scan. Can all your Kingdoms bribe the Voice of Truth? Which, while you speak, pleads for me in your Breast; Or Rage efface the Mem'ry of your Guilt, More than ten thousand Witnesses against thee? But Slander, like the loathsome Leper's Breath, Infects the Healthful with its poisonous Steams, Unless repell'd, and bids me guard my Fame. My Ancestors for Ages fill'd this Throne, A brave, a virtuous, legal Race of Princes, No arbitrary Tyrants; the same Laws, That made them Kings, declar'd their People free My Royal Father, fam'd for his Success In War and Love of Peace, had govern'd long; When with resistless Force your conquering Troops Pour'd like a Deluge o'er the Realms of Greece: To save his People from impending Ruin, At your Request, the pious, gen'rous Prince Gave up his Sons as Hostages of Peace. He diedâthe best of Kings and Men. O Castriot? I were unworthy of thy Race and Name Cou'd I unmov'd remember thou'rt no moreâ I wou'd have said, he died in firm Reliance On your Promise given, your Faith and Honour; But sure the Memory of such a Loss May well o'er-bear, and drive me from my Purpose. 'Twas then in Scorn of ev'ry Obligation, Of Truth and Justice, Gratitude and Honour, Of noblest Trust and Confidence repos'd; You like a lawless, most perfidious Tyrant, Amidst her Griefs, seiz'd on his Widow'd Kingdom; And to secure your lawless Acquisition.â Oh! how shall I proceed!âMy bleeding Heart Is pierc'd anew, new Horrors wound my Soul At every Pause; whenever I rehearse, Whene'er I think upon thy monst'rous Crimesâ O Reposio! Stanissa! Constantine! My slaughter'd Brothers, whose dear Blood still cries Aloud to Heaven;âYour Wrongs shall find Redress. Justice, defer'd, deals forth the heavier Blow. Am. Shall the great Monarchs of our sublime Race Cut off their Brothers, when they mount the Throne, Yet spare the Lives of Christians they suspect: Their Death was wife, and I approve it yet, But curse my Folly that preserv'd thy Life. Scan. What was then my Life? debarr'd of my Right, And kept t'augment the Number of your Slaves. The only Benefit you e'er confer'd, Was that you train'd me to the Use of Arms: You had my Service and was overpay'd; Yet those whom I oppos'd were, like yourself, Tyrants, who made a Merchandize of Men; And propagate Religion by the Sword. Ever determin'd not to stain my Hands With Christian Blood, when you commanded me To turn my Arms against th'Hungarian King I purpos'd from that Hour, by Heaven's Assistance, At once t'avoid the Guilt and free my Country. Am. O Traytor! dost thou glory in thy Shame? Think not I have forgot thy vile Declension. Yes on that fatal, that detested Day, When deep Moravia's Waves, died with the Blood Of forty Thousand of my faithful Slaves, Losing their Azure, flow'd in purple Tides; Too well I know, thou didst forsake thy Charge; And e're the News of thy Revolt arriv'd, Surpriz'd my Bassa that commanded here; Drove out my Garrisons, and ravish'd from me This fair and fertile Kingdom. Scan. False Aspersion! The Charge impos'd was ne'er accepted by me. I arm'd my Subjects for their common Rights. The Love of Liberty, that fired their Souls, That made them worthy, crown'd them with Success. I did my Dutyâ'Twas but what I ow'd To Heaven, an injur'd People and myself. Am. You will be justified in all that's past: But I shall bend thy stubborn Temper yetâ I know the Worth of those dear Pledges now Within my Power. Thou know'st me tooâThen think And yield in Time, while Mercy may be had. Scan. I know your Mercy by my Brothers Fate. Am. Then you may judge the future by the past. Scan. Tho' Pity be a Stranger to your Breast, Your present dang'rous State may teach you Fear. Am. Danger and I have been acquainted long; Full oft Pave met her in the bloody Field, And drove her back with Terror on my Foes: Your other Phantom, Fear, I know her not; Or in thy Visage I behold her now. Scan. I fear not for myself. Am. Yet still thou fear'st. Confess thyself subdu'd and sue for Favour. Scan. When I submit to Guilt,âI'll own your Conquest. Am. Think on your Friends. Scan. Afflictions are no Crimes. Am. You wou'd redeem them! Scan. Yes; on any Terms, That Honour may permit, and Justice warrant. Am. Hear the Conditions then. Scan. Why sinks my Heart? Why do I tremble thus? When at the Head Of almost twice a hundred Thousand Souls I with a Handful charg'd this fierce old Chief, Thou art my Witness, Heav'n, I fear'd him not. (Aside. Am. When I look back on what you were before Your late Revolt, charmed with the pleasing View, I wish to see those glorious Days restor'd; When I with Honour may indulge my Bounty, And make you great and happy as you're brave. Scan. Flattery!âNay, then he's dangerous indeed! (Aside. Am. Renounce the Errors of the Christian Sect, And be instructed in the Law profest By Ishmael's Holy Race; that Light divine, That darts from Mecca's ever sacred Fane, T'illuminate the darken'd Souls of Men, And fill 'em with its Brightness. Scan. O Althea! (Aside. Am. Break your Alliance with the Christian Princes, And let my Foes be thine. Scan. That follows well; Th'abandon'd Wretch, that breaks his Faith with Heav'n, Will hardly stop at any future Crime. (Aside. Am. Forego th' Advantage, that your Arms have won, Give up this little Part of spacious Greece, It's Cities and it's People to my Power: And in Return reign thou my Substitute O'er all my conquer'd Provinces in Europe, From Adrianople to the Walls of Buda. Scan. Assist me Heav'n! assist me to suppress The rising Indignation in my Breast, That struggles, heaves and rages for a Ventâ Aranthes! Althea! How shall I preserve you? (Aside. Vis. He's greatly mov'd, his Visage flames with Wrath. Ama. Just so he looks when rushing on the Foe, The eager Blood starts from his trembling Lips. Am. I wait your Resolution. Scan. Three Days the Truce concluded is to last; That Space I ask to answer your Demands. Am. 'Tis well; enjoy your Wishâbut yet remember Honour and Int'rest, Gratitude and Love Bleed while you pause, and press you to comply. Farther, to favour you in all I may, Aranthes shall attend you to your Camp: Consult, resolve, your Interests are the same; Althea justly claims the Care of both. [Exit Amurath, &amp;c. Scan. O thou, who art my Righteousness and Strength, Distress'd and tempted, still in thee I trust: The Pilot, when he sees the Tempest rise, And the proud Waves insult the low'ring Skies, Fix'd to the Helm, looks to that Power to lay The raging Storm, whom Winds and Seas obey. [Exit Scanderbeg, &amp;c. Amasie alone. Shou'd he comply? as sure he's hardly press'd; Restor'd to Favour, where is my Revenge? He's but a Manâless tempted I fell worse; But I'm not ScanderbegâSay, he refuses; It follows that the Sultan in his Rage, Murthers the Captives, tho' we all shou'd perish. Which Side soe'er I view, I like it not. There is no Peace for me, while Castriot lives; Plagued and distress'd, he soars above me still; Insults my Hate, and awes me with his Virtue. His Virtue! Ha! How have I dreamt till now, How 'scap'd the Thought? His Virtue shall betray him. Hypocrisy, that with an Angel's Likeness May well deceive the Wisdom of an Angel, Shall re-instate me in his gen'rous Heart: Which if I fail to pierce, may all the Ill I ever wish'd to him fall on myself.â Th'amorous PrinceâI know his haughty Soul Ill brooks his subtle Father's peaceful Schemes. He loves Althea, and depeuds on me T'assist his Flame. Enter Mahomet. Ma. Amasie, what Success? You saw the Captive Princessâ Ama. Yes, my Lord. Ma. Curse on the jealous Customs of our Court: Why is that Privilege deny'd to me? Ama. You know why I'm indulg'd. Ma. 'Tis true, but say, What hast thou done that may advance my Hopes? Ama. I've thought, my Lordâ Ma. What tell'st thou me of thoughts! Hast thou not spoke?âwhat says the charming Fair? âShall I be blest? Ama. Spoke, what? Alas! my Prince! How little do you know that haughty Christian? Bred in the rigid Maxims of her Sect, Chaste as its Precepts, most severely vertuous, Althea, wou'd treat me with the last Contempt, Shou'd I but name your gen'rous Passion to her; And proudly term it shameful and unjust. Ma. Now as you wou'd avoid a Prince's Hatred, That must one Day command you; or expect E'er to attain my Sister's Love, the Scope Of your Ambition, aid me with your Counsel. My Blood's on Fire, and I will quench the Flame, Tho' universal Ruin shou'd insue. By Heaven I will; I'll plunge in Seas of Bliss, And with repeated Draughts of Cordial Love, Expell the raging Fever from my Veins. Ama. Glorious Mischief!â(Aside.) If I judge right her Will Is ne'er to be subdu'd, you can't possess Her Mind, my Lordâand without that you knowâ Ma. Her Mind! a Shadow! Give me solid Joys, And let her Christian Minion take the Rest. I love her for myself; my Appetite Must be appeas'd, or live my constant Plague. Let me but clasp her in my longing Arms, Press her soft Bosom to my panting Breast, And crown my Wishes; tho' attain'd by Force, Tho' amidst Strugglings, Shrieks and gushing Tears; Or while she faints beneath my strong Embrace, And I have all my raging Passions crave. Am. Already I've conceiv'd the Means to serve you, But Time must give th' imperfect Embryo Form, And hail th' auspicious Birth. Ma. She's justly mine, The Purchase of my Sword. Our Prophet thus, By manly Force all prior Right destroy'd; Power was his Claim; he conquer'd and enjoy'd: Beauty and Fame alike his Ardor mov'd; Fiercely he fought, and as he fought he lov'd. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Christian Camp. Enter Scanderbeg and Aranthes. Ar. Althea mourns for this your fond Delay, And thinks already she has liv'd too long; Since living she protracts the Tyrant's Fate, And clouds the matchless Lustre of your Arms. Scan. Justice herself would here suspend her Sword; Nor with one undiscriminating Blow, Blind as she is, destroy both both Friends and Foes. Ar. It is appointed once for all to die: Then what am I, or what a Child of mine, Weigh'd with the Honour of the Christian Name, To bid the Cause of Liberty attend, While gravely you debate those very Trifles, The Time and Circumstances of our Death: As justly Nature might suspend her Course To wait the Dissolution of an Insect. âNo, let me bear Defiance to the Sultan; Tell him, that you already are determin'd; And dare his worst. Scan. Not for ten thousand Worlds. Wou'd I so tempt the fretfull Tyrants Rage? The Pangs of Death are light to those of Absence; Then who can bear eternal Seperation? Transported as you are with pious Zeal; Look inward, search your Heart, and then confess The Love of Heav'n excludes not sacred Friendship. Think if my Task were your's, how you wou'd act. Wou'd you not pause, conclude, retract, and pause again To the last moment of the Time prefixt? Wou'd you not count it Virtue to contend, Tho' against Hope, and struggle with Despair. I know you wou'd; for tho' your Tongue be mute, Spite of yourself, your streaming Eyes confess it. Ar. My Weakness is no Precedent for you. Scan. If thus the Friend, what must the Lover suffer? Think good Aranthes, if you ever lov'd, What I endure: think on Althea's Charms, And judge from thence the Greatness of my Pain. Ar. Why will you dwell upon the dang'rous Theme? The Strength of Sampson prov'd too weak for Love, David's Integrity was no Defence; The King, the Hero and the Prophet fell Beneath the same inevitable Power: The Wisdom of his Son was Folly here; And he that comprehended all Things else Knew not himself, 'till dear Experience taught Him late Repentance, Anguish, Grief and Shame. Then think no more but give us up at once; Give up Althea; Heaven demands it of you; For while she lives, your Virtue is not safe. Scan. Is this a Father's Voice? Ar: Wou'd I had died, Ere I was honour'd with a Father's Name; Or that my Child had been less good and fair. What was my greatest Joy, is now my Grief: Ev'ry Perfection wrings my Heart with Pain. For all her Charms are now so many Snares, Which you must break, or be undone for ever. âStill unresolv'd!âForgive me if I think, You have the Weakness now of other Men. Scan. If to rejoice when Virtue is rewarded; Or mourn th' Afflictions of the Good and Brave, Who mourn not for themselves; if Love and Friendship, Denote me weak, I wou'd be weaker still. He who disclaims the Softness of Humanity, Aspiring to be more than Man, is less. Yet know, my Father, rev'rend good Aranthes! Whatever tender Sentiments I feel; Tho' as a Man, a Lover and a Friend, I fear the Sultan's Cruelty and Malice; Yet as a Christian, I despise 'em both. 'Tis not for Man to glory in his Strength; The Best have fallen, and the Wisest err'd. Yet when the Time shall come, when Heaven shall by Its Providence declare, this is my Will, And this the Sacrifice that I demand, Why who can tell, but full of that same Energy, Which swells your Breast; I may reply ev'n so Thy Will be done. Ar. How have my Fears deceiv'd me? Scan. The careful Gard'ner turns the limpid Stream, This Way, or that Way; as suits his Purpose best. The Wrath of Man shall praise his Maker's Name; The Residue, restrain'd, rest on himself. Let us not rashly antedate our Woes. Tho' I defer the Sentence of your Death, Tho' I cou'd die ten thousand times to save you, I do not, nay I dare not bid you live. Ar. Excellent Man! why did I ever doubt thee? Your Zeal's no less, your Wisdom more than mine. My Time's expir'd; Illustrious Prince,âfarewel! Scan. My Father! My Althea!â Ar. O my Son! Our Part is little in this noble Conflict, The worst is Death; your's harder, but more glorious, To live and suffer. Heaven inspire thy Soul With more than Roman Fortitude and Courage: They poorly fled to Death, t'avoid Misfortunes; May Christian Patience teach thee to o'ercome 'em. [Exit Aranthes. Scanderbeg alone. In this Extremity shall I invoke Thy awful Genius, O majestick Rome; Or Junius Brutus, thine; who sacrificed To publick Liberty, Paternal Love: The younger Brutus; or the Greek Timoleon; Of Self-Denial great Examples all: But all far short of what's required of me. These Patriots offer'd to an injur'd World But guilty Wretches, who deserv'd their Fates. Wou'd they have given up the best of Men, And the most perfect of the gentler Sex To Death, to worse than Death, a Tyrant's Rage? No, Nature unassisted cannot do it. To thee, I bow me then, Fountain of Life, Of Wisdom and of Power, Who know'st our Frame, and mad'st us what we are; I ask not Length of Days, nor Fame, nor Empire: Give me to know and to discharge my Duty, And leave th' Event to theeâAmasie here!â Enter Amasie, who kneels and lays his Sword at Scanderbeg's Feet. Ama. Well may you turn away, justly disdain To cast one Look upon the lost Amasie. Constant as Truth, inflexible as Justice, Above Ambition, and the Joys of Sense, You must abhor the Wretch, whose fatal Weakness Betray'd him to such Crimes, as make him hateful To Heaven, to all good Men and to himself. Scan. What com'st thou for, what canst thou hope from me? Ama. I come for Justice. Scan. Justice must condemn thee. Ama. I have condemn'd myself; but dare not die, 'Till you, the proper Judge, confirm the Sentence. Scan. When first you fell, I deeply mourn'd your Loss; But from that Moment gave you up for ever: Ama. Still you're my Prince! my native, rightful Prince. Scan. Then what art thou? Ama. The blackest, worst of Traytors. Scan. Be that thy Punishment. Ama. Dreadful Decree! 'Tis more than I can bearâleave me not thus. Is not the Blood, that runs in either's Veins, Deriv'd from the same Source? Was I not once, Howe'er unworthy, honour'd with your Friendship, Named your Successor? so beloved, so trusted, That all the Envious pin'd, and all the Good, Look'd up with Wonder at the glorious Height, To which your partial Friendship had advanc'd me. Scan. Ill judging Man, thou aggravat'st thy Crimes. Ama. That cannot be; I but excite your Justice. Behold my guilty Breast; strike and maintain The Honour of our House. wipe out this Stain Of its illustrious Race and Blot of Friendship. Scan. If your Ambition were to fall by me, You shou'd have met me in the Front of Battle With manly Opposition, and receiv'd The Death thou seek'st for in the Rage of War. My Sword descends not on a prostrate Foe? Tho' you've deserv'd to die, I've not deserv'd To be your Executioner. Ama. Just Heaven! Are you a Christian Prince, and will you spare A black Apostate? Scan. Heaven can right itself Without my Aid, nor do I know on Earth So great, so just an Object of Compassion. Live and repent. Ama. I have and do repent, But cannot live. The Court of Amurath Abhors a Christian; ev'ry Christian Court Detests a Traytor. Scan. Miserable Man! (Aside. Ama. We're taught that Heav'n is merciful and kind. Scan. What Wretch dares doubt of that? Ama. Then why am I Deny'd to sue for Peace and Pardon there, Since I must never hope for them on Earth? Scan. Have I the Seeds of Frailty in my Nature? Am I a Man, like him, and can I see, Unpittying and unmov'd, the bitter Anguish, The deep Contrition of his wounded Soul? It will not beâO Nature take your Course, I'll not resist your tenderest Impressions. (Aside. Suppress the Tumult of your troubled Mind; You have o'ercome; I feel and share your Sorrows. Ama. O be less good, or I shall die with Shame. Scan. I have been too slow to pardon. (Embracing. Ama. O my Prince! My injur'd Prince! Scan. Thy Friend, thy Friend, Amasie. Ama. How have you rais'd me from the last Despair? And dare you trust this Rebel, this Apostate? Scan. 'Tis Heaven's Prerogative alone to search The Hearts of Men, and read their inmost Thoughts: I wou'd be circumspect, not over wise; Nor for one Error, lose a Friend for ever: No, let me be deceiv'd ere want Humanity. Ama. The Wisdom and Beneficence of Heaven Flow in your Words, and bless all those who hear 'em. (Trumpets sound a Parley. Scan. What means this Summons to a second Parley? Ama. The Sultan's haste anticipates my Purpose. (Aside. Something that much concerns your Love and Honour, I have to say; but must defer it now, And once more join his Council; if I'm seen, I lose the only Means that's left to serve you. Scan. You will returnâ Ama. As certain as the Night; About the Midst of which you may expect me. Scan. You'll find me in my Tent; The word's, Althea. Enter Officer. Off. The Visier with the Princess of Durazzo, Demands an Audience. Scan. Fly; and introduce 'em. Can this be true? Ama. Most true. The Sultan hopes That your Althea's Eyes will conquer for him: Heaven guard your Heart. FarewellâAt Night expect me. He's well deceiv'd; Hypocrisy I thank thee. Dark and profound as Hell, what Line can fathom, Or Eye explore the secret thoughts of Men? Yet once I fear'd I shou'd betray myself And be indeed the Penitent I feign'd; So much his Virtue mov'd me. Curse his Virtue! He ever will excell meâLet him die, Tho' all my Peace die with himâWretched Man! When shall I rest from Envy and Remorse? (Aside. Exit Ama. Scan. I shall once more behold Althea then. So Wretches are indulg'd the Sight of Heaven To sharpen Pain, and aggravate their Loss. The blended Beauties of the teeming Spring, Whate'er excells in Nature's Works besides, Are vile to her, the Glory of the Whole. Flowers fade and lose their Odors, Gems their Brightness, And Gold its Estimation in her Presence. But see, she comesâSure such a Form betray'd The first of Men to quit his Paradise, And all the Joys of Innocence and Peace, For those he found in her: yet had the lovely, Alas too lovely Parent of Mankind, Possess'd a Mind, as much Superior to Her outward Form, as my Althea doth; Mankind had never fell. Enter Visier, Althea, &amp;c. Scanderbeg kneels and kisses her Hand. Scan. O my Princess! Al. My ever honour'd Lord! Scan. To be your Slave, A Captive to your Charms, is more than to Be Lord of Humankind. Al. The Visier, Prince.â (Scanderbeg rises. Vis. Far be it noble Scanderbeg from me To intercept my Royal Master's Bounty, Who wills you to enjoy Freedom of Speech, Uninterrupted, with the Christian Princess. I'll with the Guards retire and wait your Leisure. (Exit Visier, &amp;c. Scan. O my Althea! Al. Speak, I'm all Attention. Scan. O who can raise his Thoughts to the Occasion? Or doing that, reduce such Thoughts to Words? Al. I will assist youâwe must part for ever. Scan. Is that, is that so easy? Righteous Heaven! It doth amaze me, and confound my Reason To hear thee, thus calm and serene, pronounce The dreadful Sentence. Al. Is it not determin'd? Scan. To give thee back to Slavery and Chains! To bear the Malice of a bloody Tyrant, Inrag'd by my Refusal!âO Althea! Tho' Heav'n must be obey'd, something is due To vertuous Love. We may, we must confess A Sense of such unutterable Woe. When in Return of my incessant Vows, You deign'd to crown my Love, when Expectation Of the long sigh'd for Bliss had raised my Joys To that exalted Pitch, that I look'd down With Pity on Mankind; and only griev'd To think they stood exposed to Disappointment, Mis'ry and Pain, while I alone was happy. Then, then to lose theeâ Al. O complain no more. You move a Weakness here, unworthy her, Who wou'd aspire to deserve your Love. I wou'd have died like the mute Sacrifice; Which goes as chearfull and as unconcern'd, To bleed upon the Altar, as to sleep Within its nightly Fold. Scan. Coud'st thou do this! Al. Had I not seen you thus, I think I shou'd; But at your Grief my Resolution fails me: I'm subdued: The Woman, the weak, fond Woman, Swells in my Heart, and gushes from my Eyes. Scan. What have I done? The Greatness of thy Soul, Not to be comprehended but by Minds Exalted as thy own, stagger'd my Reason; And what was Prudence and Superior Virtue, I thought a Wrong to Love. Rash, thoughtless Man! To force a Tenderness thou can'st not bear, That stabs the very Soul of Resolution, And leaves thee without Strength to stem a Torrent, That asks an Angel's Force to meet its Rage. Al. To combat Inclination, to subdue Our own Desires, and conquer by Submission; Are Virtues, Prince, no Angel ever knew. While these are your's, shall I indulge my Grief? âThe Storm is over, and I am calm again. Scan. O thou eternal Source of Admiration! What new Wonder hast thou prepar'd to charm My ravish'd Soul? where didst thou learn the Art To stop the Tide of Grief in its full Flow, And triumph o'er Dispair? Al. In you I triumph. Tho' rackt and torn with more than mortal Grief, Amidst the Pangs of disappointed Love And suff'ring Friendship, do I not behold thee, Still constant as the Sun, that keeps its Course, Tho' Storms and Tempests vex the neither Sky, And low'ring Clouds a while obscure his Brightness. Scan. Excellent, heavenly Maid? thou rob'st thyself, And attribut'st to me thy own Perfections. Al. Have you once question'd whether you should part With two the dearest Things to Man on Earth, A Friend and Mistress; or renounce your Faith, The Int'rest of Mankind and Cause of Virtue? Scan. That were to purchase ev'n thee too dear: That were a Misery beyond thy Loss: That were, my Princess! to deserve to lose thee. Al. That gracious Power that wrought you for this Purpose, That made you great to struggle with Adversity, And teach luxurious Princes, by Example, What Kings shou'd be, and shame 'em into Virtue; Beholds, with Pleasure, you discharge the Trust, And act up to the Dignity you're form'd for. Scan. O whither wou'd thy dazzling Virtue soar? Is't not enough we yield to our Misfortunes, And bear Afflictions, tho' with bleeding Hearts. Wou'd'st thou attempt to raise Pleasure from Pain, And teach the Voice of Mourning, Songs of Joy? Al. Small is my Part and suited to my Strength. What is dying? A Wanton Cleopatra Cou'd smile in Death and Infants die in Sleep. What tho' my Days are few and fill'd with Sorrow! Cou'd vain Prosperity to hoary Age Afford a Happiness to be compar'd To dying now in such a glorious Cause; Lamented and belov'd by thee, the best And greatest of MankindâThen let us haste And close the Scene.âYou, good Paulinus, let The Visier know, I'm ready to return. Why are you pale, why do gushing Tears Blot the majestick Beauty of your Face? Why is the Hero in the Lover lost? Scan. Let Angels, who attend in Crowds to hear thee; Let all the Sons of Liberty and Fame; Those, who still wait, and those who have obtain'd The End of all their Labours; Heaven and Earth; Angels and Men, the Living and the Dead; Behold and judge if ever Man before Purchas'd the Patriot's Name, or sav'd his Country, His Faith and Honour, at a Price so dear. Enter Visier. Vis. Well Prince, may we not hope that those bright Eyes Have charm'd your Soul to Peace? Who wou'd resist, When Honour's gain'd by being overcome? To yield to Beauty, crowns the Warrior's Fame. Scan. I'm not to learn how to esteem the Princess; But know the Sultan over-rates his Power, When he presumes to barter for her Love. Her Mind is free and royal as his own; Nor is she to be gain'd by doing what Wou'd forfeit her Esteem. And I must think This Haste to know my Mind, is Fraud or Fear. What needs there more? The Truce is unexpirsed: If your proud Master wishes for a Peace, We yet may treat on honourable Terms. In the mean Time receive the Princess back. Vis. Think what you do, great Sir. Scan. I know my Duty. Al. Farewell, my Lord! Scan. Farewell!âprotect her Heaven! Al. Now let the fretful Tyrant storm and rage, The only Danger we cou'd fear is past. [Exit Althea and Visier. Scan. T'encounter Hosts of Foes is easier far, Than to sustain this innate, Bosom War; This one unbloody Conquest costs me more, Than all the Battles I e'er won before. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Outward Apartment in the Womens Tent. A Guard of Eunuchs. Enter Kisler Aga. K. A. Tis as I thought: Our Master is betray'd. Whoever knew a Renegade sincere? This Dog's a Christian still! Enter Amasie. Ama. The Victim's prepar'd. If Lust holds on her Course, and revels yet In the hot Veins of rash, luxurious Youth, This Christian Heroine, this second Lucrece, In Mahomet shall find another Tarquin, As cruel and remorseless as the first. If I shou'd fail in my Attempt to Night, And Scanderbeg surviveâAlthea ravish'dâ He'll wish himself, I had succeeded better. (Aside. Dismiss your useless Train of prying Slaves; I've Business that requires your Ear alone. (Exeunt Eunuchs. A Grecian Chief, who owns our Master's Cause, Must be admitted to the Captive Princess. 'Tis of Importance to the Sultan's Service, That he shou'd enter and depart unknown: I'll introduce him, while you watch without That none approach to give him Interruption. Aga. This I conceive; but why he mov'd the Lady To the remotest Part of the Pavilion I cannot comprehend. (Aside. Ama. You know your Duty; Your Life shall answer for the least Neglect. Aga. I shall take Careâ(Exit Amasie.) to ruin thee, thou Traytor. SCENE II. Another Apartment; Stage darken'd; Table and Lamp. Althea discovered. Al. Is this a Time and Place for virtuous Love? This is the Wanton's Hour: Now she forsakes Her Home, and, hid in Darkness, watches for her Prey: The Soul, whom Heav'n abhors, falls in her Snares; And pierc'd with Guilt, as with an Arrow dies. Yon sickly Lamp, that glimmers thro' my Tears, Faintly contending with prevailing Darkness, Spreads o'er the Place a melancholy Gloom, That sooths the joyless Temper of my Mind. So a pale Meteor's dull and beamless Flame To the bewilder'd Traveller appears, And adds new Horrors to the cheerless Night. âIs Error then the Lot of all Mankind? It is, it isâfor Scanderbeg is fallen.â O! what cou'd move him to the rash Attempt? If he shou'd perish, as the Danger's great, How will th' insulting Infidels rejoice? How will the Foe, with scornful Triumph, sing, As a Fool dies, so died this mighty Chief; His Hands unbound, no Fetters on his Feet, But as an Ideot by his Folly falls, So fell the Champion of the Christian Cause. Enter Mahomet drest like Scanderbeg, fast'ning the door on the Inside. He's come, and all my Sorrows are compleat. Are you pursued?âO my prophetick Fears!â If undiscover'd you have enter'd here, This Caution's needless; if betray'd, in vain. Ma. Of such a Prize who can be too secure? Al. 'Tis not his Voiceâdefend me, O defend me, All gracious Heaven! Ma. Dost thou not know me Princess? Al. Alas! too well! (Aside.) Sure you've mistook your way, Or came perchance to seek some other here; Howe'er that be, permit me to retire. Ma. Mistaken Fair; or is this Ign'rance feign'd? 'Tis you alone I seek. Impetuous Love, That will not be resisted, brought me here To lay my Life and Fortune at your Feet. Al. Then I'm betray'd, basely betray'd; just Heaven! Expos'd, perhaps devoted to a Ruin, From which the Grave itself is no Retreat, And Time can ne'er repairâBe gracious, Sir, To an unhappy Maid!âOr I'm deceiv'd, Or you, my Lord, were pleas'd to mention Love; Of that, alas! I am forbid to hear; Compassion better suits my humble State, That I intreat; have Pity on me, Prince, Dispel my Fears, and send me from your Presence. Ma. Grant what you ask; I need Compassion too: Your Beauty's necessary to my Peace: Then yield, in Pity to yourself and me, What else I'll take by Force: Consent to make me Happy, and in Return, when Time shall give The Scepter to my Hand, I'll make thee Queen Of half the conquer'd Globe. Al. Know, Impious Prince! If one loose Thought wou'd buy the whole, I'd Scorn It at that Price. Ma. Then rifled and abandon'd, Live thou the Scorn both of the World and me. You have you Choice; I came not here to talk. Al. O! what were all my former Woes to this? Under the Pain of Absence, hard Captivity And my late Fears, Patience and Fortitude Were my Support; Patience and Fortitude Are useless now. Shame and Dishonour are Not to be born. Father! Aranthes! haste, And like Virginius preserve your Daughter. Come Castriot, come, Althea calls thee now To certain Death, to save her from Pollution. Ma. Call louder yet; your Idols do not hear. Al. Tho' none shou'd hear, yet Sorrow must complain. Ma. Your moving softness fans my am'rous Flameâ No Help can reach theeâAll thy Friends are absent; Wisely comply, and make a Friend of me. Al. All are not absent; he whose Presence fills Both Heaven and Earth; he, he is with me still; Sees my Distress, numbers my flowing Tears, And understands the Voice of my Complainings, Tho' Sorrow drowns my Speech. Ma. I'll wait no longer; Nor ask again for that I've Power to take. Now you may strive, as I have beg'd, in vain. Al. O thou, whose Hand sustains the whole Creation; Who cloth'st the Woods, the Vallies and the Fields; Who hear'st the hungry Lion, when he roars; And feed'st the Eagle on the Mountain's Top; Shut not thine Earâturn not away thy Face; Be not as one far off, when Danger's near; Or like an absent Friend to the distress'dâ Assist me, save meâonly thou canst save meâ O let me not invoke thy Aid in vain. Am. (Without.) Force, force an Entrance. Ma. Ha! who dares do this? [The Door burst open. Enter Amurath, Visier, Kisler Aga and Guards. Ma. Sham'd and prevented! O my cursed Fortune! Al. My Prayers are hear'd; let Virtue ne'er dispair. Vis. Guard well the Passage. K. Aga. Who secures his Sword? Vis. Scanderbeg yeild! thou can'st not hope t'escape. Am. To fall so meanly after all thy Warsâ Well may'st thou hide thy Face. Vis. Blinded by Love, My Lord, he miss'd his Way. Am. True, Osmyn, true: That poor Excuse for Madness, Vice and Folly, Is all this mighty Hero has to plead. âA fair Account of Life and Honour lost. I hoped not TriumphâProphet, 'tis too muchâ I ask'd but VengeanceâBring him to my Tent. When Mirth declining calls for something new, We'll think upon the manner of his Death. Ma. Away, you Dogs! Confusion, Death and Hell! [Exit. Al. They stand agast. Deliverance waits the just, But short's the Triumph of deceitful Men. Turn'd on themselves, their own Devices cover Them with Shame. (Aside.) [Exit. Vis. I'm lost in Admiration! It is the Prince Mahomet. Am. Wonder, Rage And Disappointment drive me to Distraction. Kisler Aga, expect to answer this. K. Aga. Let not my Lord condemn his Slave unheard. Amasie, whom I ever thought a Villain, Going this Evening to the captive Princess; I follow'd unperceiv'd, and so dispos'd me As to o'er hear him: who with many Oaths, Assur'd Althea, Scanderbeg was come; Conceal'd by Night, and in his Faith secure, Once more to see her and repeat his Vows. Of this I thought myself in Duty bound T'inform my Royal Master. Am. You are clear. K. Aga. The Caution us'd to introduce the Prince, Seem'd to confirm the Truth of what I heard. Am. Leave usâEnough; your Conduct merits Praise. [Exit K. Aga. Vis. Th' affrighted Fair is fled to her Apartment. Am. Degenerate Boy? thou art my Witness, Allah, Not so I spent my Youth, and won his Mother; Tho' much I lov'd, and long I sigh'd in vain. 'Tis vile and base to do a private Wrong: When Kings, as Kings, do ill; the Office then Must justify the Man. Vis. A Believing Monarch, Obedient to the Messenger of Heaven, Can never err. Am. Our Prophet, by the Sword, First taught the stubborn Arabs to believe, And writ his Laws in Blood. Vis. He knew Mankind. Nay, yet the Priests of all Religions teach, Whate'er is done to propagate the Faith, Must from its End, be good. Am. Thus do I stand Acquitted to myself; and Scanderbeg, Tho' by Assassination, justly falls. To Morrow's Sun shall shine for me alone. Yet, O! my faithful Osmin, all's not well: I know not how, my Spirits kindle not As they were wont, when Glory was in View. True, I rejoice; and yet, methinks, my Joy Is like the Mirth wrung from a Man in Pain. Vis. Guard, righteous Heaven, thy great Vicegerent's Health. Am. The Body simpathizes with the Mind; As that with what we love. My Languor may Be the Effect of my Hellena's Grief; I live in her. My Pleasures are improv'd, My Pains forgot, when I behold her Face; The tend'rest, fondest, most belov'd of Children. Vis. O! what has happen'd, Sir? Am. This Evening, Osmin, When I commanded her to love Amasie; And look upon him, as her future Lord, An ashy Paleness spread o'er all her Face, And gushing Tears bespoke her strong Aversion: But when t'inhance his Merit I disclosed The purpos'd Murther of his native Prince; Had I pronounc'd the Sentence of her Death, Sure less had been her Terror and Surprize. Kneeling, she call'd on Heav'n and Earth to witness Her utter Detestation of the Fact, And everlasting Hatred of Amasie, His Person and Design. Vis. Unhappy Princess! To be compell'd to marry where she hates. Am. O! she abhors him, loaths his very Name; Yet still her filial Piety prevail'd; She hung upon my Neck; pray'd for my Life, My Honour, my Success; and took her leave In such endearing Strains, as if she never Had been to fee me more. Her moving Softness Melted my old tough HeartâI kiss'd herâsigh'd, And wept as fast as she. Our mingled Tears Together flow'd down my shrunk wither'd Cheeks, And trickled from my BeardâO! shou'd my Thirst Of Vengeance kill my Child; shou'd she t'avoid Amasie, fly to Deathâwhat cou'd support me? [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Wood, thro' which is seen the Christian Camp. Enter Hellena and Cleora in Mens Apparel. Cle. Where are we Princess! whither will you wander? Hel. We've gain'd the utmost Summit of the Mountain. I hear the neigh of HorsesâSee'st thou not Those Lights that glimmer thro' the Trees, Cleora? The Christain Camp's before us. Cle. Righteous Allah! the Christian Camp!â Hel. 'Tis thither I am bound. Cle. Distraction! Hel. I am determined. Cle. Hear me, Princess! Once take the Counsel of your faithful Slave, And yet return before our Flight be known. Hel. O! no, Cleora! I must ne'er return. Cle. Then in your Father's Empire let us seek Some far remote and unfrequented Village; Where thus disguis'd, you may remain unknown To all, but me; 'till Death shall end your Sorrows. Why are you come to find new Dangers here? Alas! I thought you only fled Amasie. Hel. Why shou'd I fly from him? in his Despite I cou'd have died, ev'n in my Father's Arms. Death, ever at my Call, had been a sure Defence from his more loath'd Embraces. Gentle Maid, Think it not hard, that I've conceal'd from thee My real Intention, 'till 'twas past thy Power, Had'st thou the Inclination to prevent it. Cle. Break, break my Heart, for I've liv'd too long, Since I'm suspected by my Royal Mistress. Hel. I fear'd thy fond Affection wou'd have weigh'd Each Danger with too scrupulous a Hand. I know 'twill strike thee with the last Amazement To hear I've left the Bosom of a Father, How e'er severe to others kind to me, To seek his mortal Foe. Cle. Your Reason's lost. Hel. No; I remember well the Terrors past, And count on those to come; both worse than Death. Conscious of my weak Sex, with all its Fears, To pass by Night thro' Camps of hostile Men, And urge the Presence of that awful Prince, My Soul in secret has so long ador'dâ When I shall see him, shou'd his piercing Eye Trace me thro' my Disguise!âO my Cleora! Will not my falt'ring Tongue, my crimson Cheeks, My panting Heart and trembling Limbs betray me? What think'st thou? Say; shall I not die with Shame When I wou'd speak, and leave my Tale untold. Cle. These and a Thousand Difficulties more Oppose your Purpose; then in Time retire. Hel. No more; away; my Resolutions fixt. The Glory and the Danger's both before me, And both are mineâyou were necessary To my EscapeâThat's pastâ'Tis true indeed, Your Service has by far excell'd my Bounty: Here take these Jewels, and go seek thy Safety; I can pursue my Purpose by myself. Enter Paulinus, with a Guard; who come from the farther Part of the Stage to the Front and stand listening for some Time; Cle. O how have I deserv'd this cruel Usage? If I've discover'd any Signs of Fear, 'Twas never for myselfâGo where you please, I'll follow you to Death. Hei. Kind, faithful Maidâ Wherefore shou'd I involve thee in my Ruin? Cle. 'Tis Ruin to forsake you. Hel. Mine is certain; Thou may'st have many happy Years to come. Pau. Stand, there.âWho are you?âAnswer to the Guard. Hel. Fatal Surprize! what must we answer? Cle. Friends. Pau. Make it appearâthis InstantâGive the Word. âSilentâSome Spies sent from the Sultan's Camp. Lest favour'd by the Darkness of the Night, The Traytors shou'd Escape guard ev'ry Passage. Hel. Scanderbeg must die. (Guards surround them) Off. Not by the Hand If mine can aim aright, thou bloody Villain! [Wounds Hellena. She falls. Hel. Untimely Fate! Cle. Where are you? Hel. Here on the Earth. Cle. You're wounded then? Hel. Alas! to Death, Cleora. Cle. Prophet, I do not charge you with Injustice; But I must grieve, and wonder Things are thus. Hel. Too hasty Death, cou'dst thou not stay a little, Little longer; the Business of my Life Had soon been done, and I had come to thee. Pau. Moving Sounds! I fear you've been too rash. Ill fated Youths, who are you, and from whence? What dire Misfortune brought you to this Place? Hel. It matters not, who, or from whence we are; But as you prize pour Royal Master's Life, Conduct me to him strait: mine ebbs apace, Yet on its short Duration his depends. Pau. Your Adjuration is of such a Force, His own Commands wou'd scarce oblige me more. Sir, I'll attend you. Hel. All you fleeting Powers, Sight, Speech and Motion; O! forsake me not So near my Journey's End; assist me to Perform this only Task, and take your flight for ever. SCENE IV. Scanderbeg's Tent. Scan. Degenerate Rome! by godlike Brutus freed From CÃ¦sar and his temporary Chain Your own Ingratitude renew'd those Bonds, Beneath whose galling Weight you justly perish'd. If Freedom be Heaven's universal Gift, Th' unalienable Right of Humankind, Were all Men vertuous, there would be no Slaves. Despotick Power, that Root of Bitterness, That Tree of Death, that spreads its baleful Arms Almost from Pole to Pole; beneath whose cursed Shade, No good Thing thrives, and ev'ry ill finds Shelter; Had found no Time for its detested Growth, But for the Follies and the Crimes of Men. In ev'ry Climate, and in ev'ry Age, Where Arts and Arms and publick Virtue flourish'd, Ambition, dangerous only to itself, Crush'd in its Infancy, still found a Grave Where it attempted to erect a Throne. Enter Hellena, supported by Paulinus and Cleora; Guards following. Hel. My Blood flows faster, and my throbbing Heart Beats with redoubled force, now I behold him; O take me to thy ArmsâI die Cleora! (Swoons) Pau. He faints; support him, while we search his Wound. Cle. Away; and touch him notâO gracious Prince! If ever pity moved your Royal Breast, Let all depart except yourself and us. Scan. Let all withdraw. (Exit Paulinus, &amp;c. Now, gentle Youth, inform me, Why you oppose th' assistance of your Friend? Cle. She's gone, She's gone: O Heavens! She's past Assistance. Scan. Think what you say, and recollect your Reason. Cle. O mighty Prince! we are not what we seem, But hapless Women. Scan. Ha! Cle. Women; and sure The most distress'd, and wretched of our Sex. T'increase your Admiration, view this Face. Scan. Sure I have known these lovely Features well; But when, or where, my Recollection fails me. Cle. And well it may. O! who cou'd know thee now; Never enough deplor'd, unhappy Princess. Scan. Fearful Suggestion! Sure my Eyes deceive me! Forbid it Heaven, that this shou'd be Hellena. Hel. Who was it call'd upon the lost Hellena? Scan. Ha! she revives; fly instantly for Aid. Hel. It was his Voiceâfalse Maid, thou hast betray'd me. Stayâwhether woud'st thou go? I'm past all Aid: The friendly Hand of Death will quickly close These ever streaming Eyes, and end my Shame. O Prince! the most distinguish'd and belov'd By righteous Allah, of his Works below; You see the Daughter of relentless Amurath, Sunk with her Father's Crimes, o'erwhelm'd with Shame, Expiring at your Feet. My Weakness stands Confess'd, but be it so I will no more Lament my painfull, hopeless, fatal Flame, Since Heaven ordain'd it for your Preservation. Scan. When will my Wonder and my Anguish cease? Hel. I'm come to save you, Prince, from falling by A vile Assassin's Arm; the false Amasie, Has deeply sworn your Death; ev'n now he comes To plunge his bloody Poniard in your Breast. Scan. Fatal Mistake! what base Detractor has Traduc'd my Friend; and wrought thee, gen'rous Princess To thy Ruin? Hel. Doth not the Traytor come Here by Appointment? Scan. Ha! Hel. Whence learnt I that? Be not deceiv'd, but guard your precious Life; Or I shall die in vain. For me this bloody Enterprize was form'd; my feeble Charms, That wound but where I hate, the Motive to This Crime. Scan. Just Heav'n! that I cou'd longer doubt it! Cle. Alas! she's going raise her, gently raise her. Hel. My Head grows dizzy. Scan. Lean it on my Breast. Hel. This is indeed no Time to stand on Forms. Scan. The Pains, the Agonies of Death are on her; And yet she suffers less, much less, than I. What generous Heart can bear it? Hel. Do not grieve: And yet methinks your Pity sooths my Pain. Scan. Why wou'dst thou give thy Life to Ransom mine? Wou'd I had died, or yet cou'd die, to save thee. Hel. I'd not exchange my Death, lamented thus And in your Arms, for any other's Lifeâ Unless Althea's. Scan. Were Althea here She wou'd forget her own severe Distress, And only weep for yours. Hel. May she be happy! Yet had you never seen her, who can tell, You sometimes might, perhaps, have thought on me. Scan. He in my Place who cou'd refrain from Tears, Unenvied let him boast of his Brutality. I'm not asham'd to own myself a Man. Hel. Farewel, Cleora!âweep not, gentle Maid; I recommend her, Sir, to your Protection. And, O victorious Prince; if e'er hereafter Conquest shou'd give my Father to your Sword âThen think on meâsuspend your lifted Arm, And spareâO spare his Lifeâforget your Wrongs; Or think them punished in his Daughter's Loss. (Dies. Scan. Her gentle Soul is fled; she rests in peace; While we, methinks, like Gratitude and Grief, Form'd by the Sculpture's Art to grace her Urn; Moving, tho' lifeless; eloquent, tho' dumb; Excite incurious Mortals to explore, Virtues so rare, and trace the shining Store, That cou'd a Life so short so well supply; Yet mourn with us such Excellence shou'd die.

Cou'd Love, that fills each honest, gen'rous Breast With double Ardor to excel in Vertue, Conclude, thou Wretch! what Malice first begun, And finish thee a Villain? Thou wou'dst dieâ We'll disappoint theeâLive, tortur'd with Guilt, A Terror to thyself: Or let the Sultan, The vile Abettor of thy Crimes, reward thee; We know no Punishment to suit thy Guilt. This is a Christian Land. Our Laws were made For Men, not Monsters.âTake him from my Sight. 'Tis needless to repeat that by Hostility, (Exit Amasie. Of the worst Kind, our faithless Enemies Have broke the Truce. We're now again prepar'd Once more to prove the Fortune of our Arms; And try by honest Force, seeing all Treaties With such perfidious Men are vain, to free Our Captive Friends, and drive these fierce Destroyers From Epirus. Paulinus with your Squadrons Attack the Trenches Westward of the City, T'amuse the Foe, and draw their Force that way; Then I'll, with the remaining Troops, assault Th' East; where doubly intrench'd the Royal Tents, The Prison of Althea and her Father, Raise their aspiring Heads.

Now let me thinkâThere must have been a Change, A Revolution in the Source of Things. The former Chain of Beings is dissolv'd: Effects roll backward, and direct their Causes, And Nature is no more. Thou hoary Wretch, Tear thy white Locks, abandon ev'ry Hope, Renounce Humanity and all its Tyes. Duty and Virtue, Gratitude and Love, Forsook the World, when my Hellena fled.

Sure Sleep has left all Eyes, as well as mine. Fate is at work; I sink beneath my Fears. Since I have known a Danger worse than Death My Courage has forsook me. Enter Aranthes. Ha! who comes At this late Hour? Protect me righteous Heaven! Ar. Why, my Althea! dost thou fly thy Father? Al. Sure 'tis his Voice! O gracious Heaven! it is, It is my Father.âMost unlook'd for Joy! Ar. Do I once more behold thee, my Althea! Al. To whose bless'd Bounty do we owe this Meeting? Ar. Thou dearest earthly Bliss, this Moment's our's, No Matter how attain'd; I have thee now In my fond Arms, and wou'd indulge my Joy, Nor think how soon 'twill end. Why shou'd poor Mortals, To trouble born, anticipate their Pains? Al. I can't conceal my Fears: If you again Must leave me here, the Sun in all its Course, Sees not a Wretch so lost as poor Althea. Ar. Alas! why will you urge me to disclose What wou'd, tho' I were silent, soon be known. The wrathful Sultan has pronounc'd our Death. Yes, I am come to die with thee, my Child! Al. Then we shall part no more. My Soul's at PeaceâForgive, O righteous Heaven! My weak Distrust of thy Almighty Power, Thy Kindness and Protection. O my Father! I wish'd t'have died alone; yet at your Death, I must not, dare not murmur or complain; Since Heaven with you permits me to descend, Pure and unspotted to the peaceful Grave. Ar. Heroick Maid! O most exalted Virtue. [Aside, Weeping. Al. Why do you hide your Face, why turn you from me? Be not surpriz'd, nor charge me with Unkindness. There is my dearest Father! one Calamity, Tho' sure but one, by far more dreadful Ev'n than thy DeathâO speak, speak to me, Sir! Ar. Good Heav'n! my Joy's too great;âI cannot speak. Tears must relieve me, or my Heart will burst. I thank thee, Heaven! I have not liv'd in vain. This happy Hour o'erpays an Age of Sorrow. My Child! my Life! my Soul! my dear Althea! Thy bright Example fires my Emulation; Thou hast the Start, but must not bear away The Victor's Palm alone, and shame thy Father. No, my Althea! to that bounteous Hand Which made thee what thou art, and made thee mine, Without the least Reluctance, I'll resign thee.â And see the Tryal comes. Enter K. Aga and Mutes. Aga. Forgive, fair Princess, a devoted Slave, (Kneeling. Who knows no Will, but his imperial Lord's; No Merit, but Obedience. Cou'd my Tears Have mov'd the Sultan, I had been excused This fatal Visit. Al. Kisler Aga, rise; Spite of thy Office, thou hast a human Soul. What are thy Master's Orders? Art thou come A second Time to my Deliv'rance? Aga. If Death, sudden, violent and immature, Be a Deliverance; you will soon be free. Al. To Minds prepar'd, Death strip'd of all its Terrors, In any Form, at any Hour is welcome. Aga. Whether the Sultan, raging for the Loss Of his lov'd Daughter, thinks that other's Pain, In the same Kind, wou'd mitigate his own; Or from some other Cause, I cannot say; But he has order'd that the Lady first Shou'd suffer Death, her Father being present.â I see you're mov'd. Ar. I am:âBut 'tis with Scorn Of your proud Master's Impotence and Malice. Alas! I'm not to learn my Child is mortal. Aga. These eager Blood Hounds growl at my Delay, And will, perhaps, accuse me to the Sultan. Al. Obey the Tyrant, let them do their Office. Aga. I must; but Heaven can tell with what Reluctance. The only Favour in my Power to grant, Is the sad Choice of dying by the Bowstring, The fatal Poynard, or this pois'nous Draught. Al. Give me the Bowl. Death, this Way seems less frightful, Than from the Hands of rude and barbarous Men. Ar. Farewell, my Child! Al. Assist me with your Prayers. Ar. My Prayers have been incessant as thy own, And both are heardâFear notâthy Crown's prepar'd; And Heav'n, with all its Glories, lies before thee: Millions of Angels wait to guard the Passage; Thou can'st not miss thy way. Al. Shou'd Heav'n preserve you?â Shou'd you live to see him?âcommend me to My LordâTell him, that I die hisâThat Heaven, Which calls me now, is only lov'd beyond him.â That I'm not lostâThat we shall meet again.â Bid him not grieve.â [Allarm. Enter Scanderbeg, &amp;c. He flies to Althea. Scan. Away you sacrilegious SlavesâShe livesâ I have her warm and panting in my Armsâ Lift up thy Eyes, dearer to mine than Lightâ O let me hear the Musick of thy Voice, Lest I shou'd doubt I come too late to save thee, And Discord seize my Soul. Al. Surprize is dumb. So sudden a Transition who can bear? My Thoughts were all just reconcil'd to Death, But thou hast call'd them back. The Love of Life, That seem'd extinguish'd in me, now returns. O! if there is a Happiness on Earth, Here I must find it, here and only here. Scan. Aranthes too!âhe lives!âConsummate Joy! Ar. And lives by thee, thou glorious happy Youth O let me press thee in my longing Armsâ My Child too!âMy Althea!â Al. O my Father! Ar. Compleat Felicity! Al. O dangerous Bliss! (Weeps) Scan. Why weeps my Life? Al. Some have their Portion here: Flatt'ring Prosperity has ruin'd Thousands, Whom Death with all its Terrors cou'd not shake. Scan. Thy pious Fears shall guard us from that Danger. Al. Is not the Glory of both Worlds too much For frail, imperfect Mortals to expect? Scan. Our Happiness, tho' great, is far from perfect; Since she, the fair unfortunate Hellena, To whom next Heav'n we owe it, is no more. I cannot blame your Tears; this is no time To tell the mournful Tale, that must when e'er, Remember'd, make me sad, tho' crown'd with Victory, And in thy Arms. Croia, reliev'd, expects us: My grateful Subjects will for thy Deliv'rance Express more Joy, than that their Foes are fled. Enter Paulinus, and the Sultan, Prisoner. Pau. Hail glorious King! Your Conquest is compleat; Behold Ambitious Amurath your Captive. Scan. Take off his Chains. Am. What Pageantry is this? Scan. Sound a Retreat; since none resist, let War, And Slaughter cease. It grieves my Soul to think The Crimes of One shou'd cost Mankind so dear. Pau. Sir, how will you dispose the cruel Tyrant? Scan. Give him his Liberty, and leave him here Till he shall think it proper to retire. Such of his Subjects as attend him now, Or shall repair hither to do him Service, Shall all be safe. His lovely, virtuous Daughter, Worthy a better Race and happier Fate, Preserv'd my Life. Am. Dogs! Slaves! will none dispatch me? Must I hear this yet be compell'd to live? Scan. Unhappy Man! how will he bear the rest? When Justice strikes let guilty Mortals tremble And all revere her Power, but none insult The miserable. Her impartial Sword Scorns to assist Man 's selfish, low Revenge: T'avoid her Anger let us shun the Thought. Be witness, Heaven! I pity and forgive him. [Exeunt Scan. Aran. &amp; Althea. Am. Can this be true! Am I cast down from that Majestick Height, where like an earthly God, For more than half an Age, I sate enthron'd, To the abhor'd Condition of a Slave? A pardon'd Slave! What! live to be forgiven! And all this brought upon me by Hellena! Shou'd our Prophet return to Earth and swear it I'd tell him to his Face that he was perjured. Hell wants the Power and Heaven wou'd never curse To that Degree a doating, fond, old Man.â What make my Child! my loving, gentle Child! The Instrument and Author of my Ruin! Enter Visier Officers and Amasie. Vis. Beg them to halt; blast not a Parent's Eye With such a Sight. Am. What Sight? but 'tis no Matter; There's nothing left for me to hope or fear. Vis. A mourning Troop of Christians from their Camp In solemn Pomp's arriv'd; who, bath'd in Tears, (What En'my cou'd refrain?) attend a Chariot, That bears Hellena bleeding, pale and dead. Am. False Mahomet! [Swoons. Off. Our Royal Master's dead! Vis. No! he revives; Alas! he's not so happy! Am. I saw Amasie. Vis. Here the Traytor stands, By Scanderbeg committed to your Mercy. Am. Hellena did prevent me.â Am. Damn'd Apostate! I've heard enough and have no time to lose.â See him impal'd alive; we'll let him know As much of Hell as can be known on Earth, [Exit Amasie. And go from Pain to Pain. Where is my Son? Vis. Fled towards Andrianople. Am. He doth well: Death has o'ertook me here. Lord of so many Fair, spacious Kingdoms, in a hostile Land, Oppress'd with Age, Misfortunes, Grief and Shame, Amurath breaths his last; and leaves his Bones To beg from Foes an ignominious Grave. False or ungrateful Prophet! Have I spread Fell Devastation over half the Globe, To raise thy Crescent's Pale, uncertain Light, Above the Christians glowing, Crimson Cross, In hoary Age to be rewarded thus!â When the Hungarian King had broke his Faith; Distress'd, to his own Prophet I appeal'd, A Stranger, and an Enemy; he did me Right; Restor'd lost Vict'ry to my flying Troops, And gave the perjur'd Monarch to my Sword. But I have doneâCou'dst thou repent, there's nothing In thy Power worth my Acceptance now. Glory, to thee I've liv'd, but pining Grief Robs thee of half the Honour of my Death. Osmin, and you my other faithful Chiefs, The poor Remains of all the mighty Host I brought to this curs'd Siege, this Grave of my Renown, If you return, and live to see my Son, Bid him remember how his Father fell; Bid him ne'er sheath the Sword, Till my diminish'd Fame shine forth and blaze a new In his Revenge-Revenge me-Oh! Revenge. [Dies. Vis. Eclips'd and in a Storm our Sun is set: And now, methinks, as when our Prophet fled, Terror shou'd seize on each believing Heart. Let some inform the KingâThis was his Fate; 'Tis ours to be left without a Guide. Disperse, wander, away; our Shephard's lost. Exeunt. SCENE the Last. Enter Scan. Aran. Althea. Pau. and Guards. Scan. That you are free and happy I rejoice. If I have faithfully discharged my Trust I'm well rewarded here. Pau. O royal Sir! Your Happiness is ours; this virtuous Princess An equal Blessing to your self and People. 2d Off. To say each Subject loves you as himself, Is less than Truth: We love you as we ought; As a free People shou'd a Patriot King. Scan. This is to reign; this is to be a King. Who can controul his Power, who rules the Will Of those o'er whom he reigns? or count his Wealth, Who has the Hearts of Subjects that abound. Was ever Prince so absolute as I? Pau. Or ever Subjects so intirely free? Whose Duty's Interest, and Obedience Choice. Scan. For this alone was Government ordain'd; And Kings are Gods on Earth but while, like Gods, They do no ill, but reign to bless Mankind. May proud, relentless Amurath's Misfortunes Teach future Monarchs to avoid his Crimes. Th' impious Prince, who does all Laws disown, Yet claims from Heaven a Right to hold his Throne, Blasphemes that Power, which righteous Kings obey; For Justice and Mercy bound ev'n th' Almighty's Sway. End of the Fifth Act. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE Spoken by Mrs. CLIVE. The serious Bus'ness of the Night being over, Pray, Ladies, your Opinion of our Lover? Will you allow the Man deserves the Name, Who quits his Mistress to preserveâhis Fame? And what was Fame in that Romantick Age?â But sure such Whims ne'er were but on the Stage. A Statesman rack his Brains, a Soldier fightâ Merely to do an injur'd People Right.â What! serve his Country, and get nothing by 't! Why, ay, says Bays, George Castriot was the Man; 'Tis a known TruthâBelieve him those who can. Not but we've Patriots too, tho' I am told There's a vast Diff'rence 'twixt the new and old: Say, theirs cou'd fight, I'm sure that ours canâscold. But to the Glory of the present Race, No stubborn Principles their Worth debase; Patriots when out, are Courtiers when in Place. So, vice versa, turn a Courtier out, No Weather-Cock more swiftly veers about. His Country now, good Man! claims all his Care.â Who'd see it plunder'd?âthat's deny'd his Share. Since Courtiers and Anticourtiers both have shown That by the Publick Good they mean their own; What if each Briton, in his Private Station, Should try to bilk those, who imbroil the Nation; Quit either Faction, and, like Men, unite To do their King and injured Country Right: Both have been wrong'd: Prevent their guilty Joy, Who wou'd your mutual Amity destroy. Wou'd you preserve your Freedom? guard his Throne, Who makes your Peace and Happiness his own. Wou'd you be grateful? let your Monarch know Which Way you wou'd be best, and make him so. But soft! methinks, I hear some Fops complain; Who came prepared to give the Ladies Pain, That they have dress'd and spentâGad's Curseâthree Hours in vain. No Hints obscene, improved by their broad Stare, Have given Confusion to the tortured Fair. We own the Charge. Let Monsieur Harlequin And his trim Troop your loose Applauses win: Too much already has each modest Ear Been there insulted; we'll protect them here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue spoken by Mr. Cibber Sacred to Virtue, Liberty, and Truth, The Muses bloom in Everlasting Youth. Press'd, like the Palm, they rise beneath their Weight, And soar above the Reach of Time, or Fate. When Brass, or Marble, faithless to their Trust, No longer bear the Name, nor guard the Dust Of Kings, or Heroes, to their Charge consign'd, But yield to Age, and leave no Track behind; The Poet's Pen, with never dying Lays; Preserves their Fame and celebrates their Praise. Let Artful Maro, or bold Lucan tell, How regal Troy, or Rome, more awfull, fell; Nations destroy'd revive, lost Empires shine, And Freedom glows in each immortal Line. In vain would Faction, War, or lawless Power, Which marr the Patriot's Scheme, his Fame devour; When Bards, by their Superior Force, can save, From dark Oblivion and defeat the Grave. Say, Britons, must this Art forsake your Isle, And leave to vagrant Apes, her native Soil? Must She, the dearest Friend that Freedom knows, Driv'n from her Seat, seek Refuge with her Foes? Forbid so great a Shame, and save the Age From such Reproach, You Patrons of the Stage. Since well we know, there's not a Theme so dear, As virtuous Freedom, to a British Ear; T' indulge so just a Taste, to Night we sing A Pious Hero, and a Patriot King; By Nature form'd, by Providence design'd To Scourge Ambition, and to right Mankind: Such Castriot was. O might it but appear, That he retains the least Resemblance here! Should but the smallest Portion of that Fire, Which fill'd his ample Breast our Scenes inspire: The abject Slave, to his Reproach, shall see, That such as dare deserve it, may be free: And conscious Tyranny confess, with Shame, That blind Ambition wanders from her Aim; While Virtue leads her Votaries to Fame.</field>
