      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scæna Prima. Enter Virolet, and Boy. Uirolet. Boy. Boy. Sir? Vir. If my wife seek me, tell her that Designes of weight, too heavy for her knowledge, Exact my privacy. Boy. I shall, sir. Uir. Do then, And leave me to my selfe. Boy. Tis a raw morning, And would you please to interpret that for duty Which you may construe boldnesse, I could wish To arme your selfe against it, you would use More of my service. Uir. I have heate within here, A noble heat (good boy) to keep it off, I shall not freeze; deliver my excuse, Enter Juliana. And you have done your part. Boy. That is prevented, My Lady follows you. Vir. Since I must be crost then, Let her perform that office. Boy. I obey you. Exit. Uir. Prethee to bed; to be thus fond's more tedious Then if I were neglected. Jul. Tis the fault then Of love and duty which I would fall under, Rather then want that care which you may challenge As due to my obedience. Vir. I confesse This tendernesse argues a loving wife, And more deserves my hearts best thanks then anger. Yet I must tell ye Sweet, you do exceed In your affection, if you would ingrosse me To your delights alone. Jul. I am not jealous, If my embraces have distasted you, As I must grant you every way so worthy That tis not in weak woman to deserve you, Much lesse in miserable me, that want Those graces some more fortunate are stor'd with. Seek any whom you please, and I will study With my best service to deserve those favours, That shall yeeld you contentment. Vir. You are mistaken. Jul. No, I am patient sir, and so good morrow; I will not be offensive. Vir. Heare my reasons. Jul. Though in your life a widdows bed receives me, For your sake I must love it. May she prosper That shall succeed me in it, and your ardour Last longer to her. Vir. By the love I beare First to my Countries peace, next to thy selfe To whom compar'd, my life I rate at nothing; Stood here a Lady that were the choyce abstract Of all the beauties nature ever fashion'd, Or Art gave ornament to, compar'd to thee, Thus as thou art obedient and loving, I should contemne and loath her. Jul. I do believe ye. How I am blest In my assur'd beliefe? this is unfain'd; And why this sadnesse then? Vir. Why Juliana, Believe me, these my sad and dull retirements, My often, nay almost continued fasts, Sleep banisht from my eyes, all pleasures strangers, Have neither root nor growth from any cause That may arrive at woman. Shouldst thou be, As chastity forbid, false to my bed, I should lament my fortune, perhaps punish Thy falshood, and then study to forget thee: But that which like a never emptied spring, Feeds high the torrent of my swelling griefe, Is what my Countrey suffers; there's a ground Where sorrow may be planted, and spring up, Though yeelding rage and womanish despaire, And yet not shame the owner. Jul. I do believe it true, Yet I should think my selfe a happy woman, If in this generall and timely mourning, I might or give to you, or else receive A little lawfull comfort. Vir. Thy discretion In this may answer for me; look on Naples The Countrey where we both were born and bred, Naples the Paradise of Italy, As that is of the earth; Naples, that was The sweet retreat of all the worthiest Romans, When they had shar'd the spoyles of the whole world; This flourishing Kingdom, whose inhabitants For wealth and bravery liv'd like petty Kings, Made subject now to such a tyranny, As that faire City that receiv'd her name From Constantine the great, now in the power Of barbarous Infidels, may forget her own, To look with pity on our miseries, So far in our calamities we transcend her. For since this Arragonian tyrant Ferrand, Ceaz'd on the government, there's nothing left us That we can call our own, but our afflictions, Jul. And hardly those; the Kings strange cruelty, Equals all presidents of Tyranny. Vir. Equall say you: He has out gone, the worst compar'd to him; Nor Phalaris, nor Dionisius, Caligula, nor Nero can be mention'd; They yet as Kings, abus'd their regall power; This as a Marchant, all the Countries fatt, He wholy does ingrosse unto himself; Our Oyles he buyes at his own price, then sels them To us, at dearer rates; our Plate and Jewels, Under a fayn'd pretence of publique use, He borrows; which deny'd, his Instruments force. The rases of our horses, he takes from us; Yet keeps them in our pastures; rapes of Matrons, And Virgins, are too frequent; never man Yet thank'd him for a pardon; for Religion, It is a thing he dreames not off. Iul. I have heard, How true it is, I know not; that he sold The Bishop-prick of Tarent to a Jew, For thirteene thousand Duckets. Vir. I was present, And saw the money paid; the day would leave me, Ere I could number out his impious actions; Or what the miserable Subject suffers; And can you entertaine in such a time, A thought of dalliance? teares, and sighes, and groanes, Would better now become you. Iul. They indeed are, The onely weapons, our poor Sex can use, When we are injur'd, and they may become us; But for men that were born free men, of Ranck; That would be registred Fathers of their Country; And to have on their Tombs in Golden Letters, The noble stile of Tyrant killers, written; To weepe like fooles, and women and not like wise men. To practise a redresse, deserves a name, Which fits not me to give. Vir. Thy grave reproofe: If what thou dost desire, were possible To be effected? might well argue it, As wise as loving; but if you consider, With what strong guards, this Tyrant is defended: Ruffins, and male contents drawne from all quarters; That onely know, to serve his impious will; The Citadels built by him in the neck Of this poor City; the invincesible strength, Nature by Art assisted, gave this Castle; And above all his feare; admitting no man To see him, but unarm'd; it being death For any to approach him with a weapon. You must confesse, unlesse our hands were Canons, To batter down these walls; our weake breath mines, To blow his Forts up; or our curses lightning, To force a passage to him; and then blast him; Our power is like to yours, and we like you; Weepe our misfortunes. Iul. Walls of Brasse resist not A noble undertaking; nor can vice, Raise any Bulwrack, to make good the place, Where vertue seekes to enter; then to fall In such a brave attempt, were such an honour; That Brutus, did he live again would envy. Were my dead Father in you, and my Brothers; Nay, all the Ancestors I am deriv'd from; As you, in being what you are, are all these. I had rather weare a mourning Garment for you, And should be more proud of my widdow-hood; You dying for the freedome of this Country; Then if I were assur'd, I should injoy A perpetuity of life and pleasure, With you; the Tyrant living. Vir. Till this minute, I never heard thee speake; O more then woman! And more to be belov'd; can I finde out A Cabinet, to lock a secret in, Of equall trust to thee? all doubts, and feares, That scandalize your sex, be farre from me; Thou shalt pertake my neer and dearest councels, And further them with thine. Iul. I will be faithfull. Vir. Know then this day, stand heaven propitious to us, Our liberty begins. Iul. In Ferrands death? Vir. 'Tis plotted love, and strongly, and beleeve it, For nothing else could doe it; 'twas the thought, How to proceed in this designe and end it, That made strange my embraces. Iul. Curs'd be she, That's so indulgent to her own delights, That for their satisfaction, would give A stop to such a glorious enterprize: For me, I would not for the world, I had been Guilty of such a crime; goe on and prosper. Goe on my dearest Lord, I love your Honour Above my life; nay, yours; my Prayers go with you; Which I will strengthen with my teares: the wrongs Of this poor Country, edge your sword; O may it Peirce deep into this Tyrants heart, and then When you return bath'd in his guilty bloud, I'le wash you cleane with fountaines of true joy. But who are your assistants? though I am So covetous of your glory, that I could wish You had no sharer in it. Knock. Vir. Be not curious. They come, how ever you command my bosome, To them I would not have you seene. Iul. I am gon Sir, Be confident; and may my resolution Be present with you. Exit. Vir. Such a Masculine spirit, With more then womans vertues, were a dower To waigh down a Kings fortune. Briss. Good day to you. Enter Brissonet Camillo, Ronvere. Cam. You are an early stirrer. Vir. What new face, Bring you along? Ron. If I stand doubted Sir? As by your looks I guesse it: you much injure A man that loves, and truly loves this Country, With as much zeale as you doe; one that hates The Prince by whom it suffers, and as deadly; One that dares step as farre to gaine my freedome, As any he that breathes; that weares a sword As sharp as any's. Cam. Nay, no more comparisons. Ron. What you but whisper, I dare speake aloud, Stood the King by; have meanes to put in act too What you but coldly plot; if this deserve then Suspition in the best, the boldest, wisest? Pursue your own intents, il'e follow mine; And if I not out-strip you— Briss. Be assur'd Sir, A conscience like this can never be allide To treachery. Cam. Who durst speake so much, But one that is like us a sufferer, And stands as we affected? Vir. You are cozend And all undone; every Intelligencer Speakes treason with like licence; is not this Ronvere, that hath for many yeeres been train'd In Ferrands Schoole, a man in trust and favour, Rewarded too and highly? Cam. Grant all this, The thought of what he was, being as he is now; A man disgrac'd, and with contempt thrown off; Will spurre him to revenge, as swift as they, That never were in favour. Vir. Poore and childish. Briss. His regiment is cast, that is most certain; And his command in the Castle given away. Cam. That on my knowledge. Vir. Grosser still, what shepheard Would yeeld the poor remainder of his flock, To a known wolfe; though he put on the habit, Of a most faithfull dogge, and barke like one? As this but onely talkes. Cam. Yes, he has meanes too. Virol. I know it to my griefe, weake men I know it; To make his peace, if there were any warre Between him and his Master, betraying Our innocent lives. Ron. You are too suspitious; And I have born too much, beyon'd my temper, Take your own wayes, i'le leave you. Vir. You may stay now; You have enough, and all indeed you fisht for; But one word Gentlemen: have you discover'd To him alone our plot? Briss. To him and others, that are at his devotion. Vir. Worse and worse: For were he onely conscious of our purpose, Though with the breach of Hospitable lawes, In my own house, ide silence him for ever: But what is past my help, is past my care, I have a life to loose. Cam. Have better hopes. Ron. And when you know, with what charge I have further'd Your noble undertaking, you will sweare me Another man; the guards I have corrupted: And of the choyce of all our noblest youths, Attir'd like virgins; such as Hermits would Welcome to their sad cells, prepar'd a Maske; As done for the Kings pleasure. Vir. For his safety I rather feare; and as a pageant to Usher our ruine. Ron. We as Torch-bearers Will waite on these, but with such art and cunning; I have convei'd sharp poniards in the Wax, That we may passe, though search't through all his guards Without suspition, and in all his glory, Oppresse him, and with safety. Cam. 'Tis most strange. Vir. To be effected. Ron. You are doubtfull still. Briss. But we resolv'd to follow him, and if you Desist now Virolet, we will say 'tis feare, Rather then providence. Exeunt. Cam. And so we leave you, Enter Julian. Iul. To your wise doubts, and to my better councels; Oh! pardon me my Lord, and trust me too; Let me not like Cassandra prophesie truths, And never be beleiv'd, before the mischiefe: I have heard all; know this Ronvere a villaine, A villaine that hath tempted me, and plotted This for your ruine, onely to make way To his hopes in my embraces; at more leisure I will acquaint you, wherefore I concell'd it To this last minute; if you stay you are lost, And all prevention too late. I know, And 'tis to me known onely, a darke cave Within this house, a part of my poor dower, Where you may lye conceal'd, as in the center, Till this rough blast be ore; where there is ayre, More then to keep in life; Ferrand will find you, So curious his feares are. Vir. 'Tis better fall Then hide my head, now 'twas thine own advice, My friends ingag'd too. Iul. You stand further bound, Then to weake men that have betray'd themselves, Or to my Councell, though then just and loyall: Your phansie hath been good, but not your judgement, In choyce of such to side you; wil you leape From a steep Tower, because a desperate foole Does it, and trusts the wind to save his hazard? There's more expected from you; all mens eyes are fixt On Viriolet, to help not hurt them; Make good their hopes and ours, you have sworn often, That you dare credit me; and allow'd me wise Although a woman; even Kings in great Actions, Waite opportunity and so must you Sir, Or loose your understanding. Vir. Thou art constant; I am uncertain foole, a most blinde foole; Be thou my guide. Jul. I. I faile to direct you, For torment or reward, when I am wretched, May constancy forsake me. Vir. I've my safety. Enter Castruchio, and Villio. Vil. Why are you rapt thus? Cast. Peace, thou art a foole. Vil. But if I were a flatterer like your worship, I should be wise and rich too; There are few else that prosper, baudes excepted, They hold an equall place there. Cast. A shrew'd knave; But O the King, the happy King! Vil. Why happy? In bearing a great burthen. Cast. What beares he, That's born on Princes shoulders? Vil. A Crownes waight, Which sets more heavy on his head, then the ore Slaves digge out of the Mines, of which 'tis made. Cast. Thou worthily art his fool, to think that heavy That carryes him in the ayre; the reverence due To that most sacred Gold, makes him ador'd, His Foot-steps kist, his smiles to raise a begger To a Lords fortune; and when he but frownes, The City quakes. Vil. Or the poor Cuckolds in it, Cox-combs I should say, I am of a foole. Vil. Grown a Philosopher, to heare this parasite. Cast. The delicates he is serv'd with see and envy, Vil. I had rather have an Onyon with a stomack, Then these without one. Cast. The Celestiall Musick, still Musick. Such as the motion of the eternall spheares Yeelds Iove, when he drinkes Nectar. Vil. Here's a fine knave, yet hath to many fellowes. Cast. Then the beauties, That with variety of choyce embraces, these passe o're. Renew his age. Vil. Help him to croutch rather, And the French Cringe, they are excellent Surgeons that way. Cast. O Majesty! let others think of heaven, While I contemplate thee. Vil. This is not Atheisme, but Court observance. Cast. Now the God appears, usher'd with earth-quakes. Vil. Base Idolatry. Flourish Enter Ferrand, Guard, women, Servants. Fer. These meates are poysoned, hang The Cookes; no note more, on Forfeit of your fingers; doe you Envy me a minutes slumber, what are these? 1. Gu. The Ladies appointed by your Majesty. Fer. To the purpose, for what appointed? 1. Gu. For your graces pleasure. Fer. To sucke away the little bloud is left me, By my continuall cares; I am not apt now, Injoy them first, taste of my dyet once; And your turne serv'd, for fifty Crownes a peece Their Husbands may redeem them. Wo. Great Sir, mercy. Fer. I am deafe, why stare you? is what we command To be disputed? who's this? bring you the dead T'upbrai'd me to my face? Cast. Hold Emperour; Hold mightest of Kings, I am thy vassell, Thy Foot-stool, that durst not presume to look On thy offended face. Fer. Castruchio rise. Cast. Let not the lightning of thy eye consume me, Nor heare that Musicall tongue, in dreadfull thunder, That speakes all mercy. Vir. Here's no slattering rogue. Cast. Ferrand, that is the Father of his people, The glory of mankinde. Fer. No more, no word more; And while I tell my troubles to my selfe, Be Statues without motion or voyce, Though to be flatter'd, is an itch to greatnesse, It now offends me. Vil. Here's the happy man; But speake who dares. Fer. When I was innocent; I yet remember, I could eat and sleepe, Walke unaffrighted, but now terrible to others: My guards cannot keepe feare from me It still pursues me; Oh! my wounded conscience, The Bed I would rest in, is stuft with thornes; The grounds strow'd o're with adders, and with aspicks Where ere I set my foot, but I am in, And what was got with cruelty, with blood, Must be defended, though this lifes a hell, I feare a worse hereafter. ha! Ron. My Lord. Enter Ronvere and guard. Fer. Welcome Ronvere, welcome my golden plummet With which I sound mine enemies depthes and angers, Hast thou discover'd. Ron. All as you could wish Sir, The Plot, and the contrivers; was made one Of the conspiracie. Fer. Is Virolet in? Ron. The head of all, he onely scented me: And from his feare, that I plaid false is fled; The rest I have in fetters Fer. Death and hell. Next to my mortall foe the pyrat Sesse, I aym'd at him; he's vertuous, and wise, A lover of his freedome and his countries Dangerous to such as govern by the sword, And so to me: no tract which way he went, No meanes to overtake him? Ron. Ther's some hope left; But with a rough hand, to be seas'd upon. Fer. What is't? Ron. If any know, or where he is, Or which way he is fled, it is his wife; Her with his Father I have apprehended, And brought among the rest. Fer. 'Twas wisely order'd, Go fetch them in, and let my executioners Exit Ronvere. Appeare in horrour with the racke. Vil. I take it signeur, this is no time for you to flatter, Or me to foole in. Cast. Thou art wise in this, let's off, it is unsafe to be nere Jove, When he begins to thunder. Vil. Good morality. Exit. Fer. I that have peirc'd into the hearts of men; Forc'd them to lay open with my lookes, Secrets whose least discovery was death, Will rend for what concernes my life, the fortresse, Of a weake womans faith. Enter Ronvere, guard, Executioners with a Rack, Camillo, Brissonet Pandulfo, Juliana. Ca. What ere we suffer, The waight, that loads a Traytors Heart fit ever, heavy on thine. Briss. As we are caught by thee, Fall thou by others. Ron. Pish poor fools, your curses will Never reach me. Iul. Now by my Uirolets life; Father, this is a glorious stage of murther. Here are five properties too, and such spectators, As will expect good action, to the life; Let us performe our parts, and we shall live, When these are rotten, would we might begin once; Are you the Master of the company? Troth you are tedious now. Fer. She does deride me. Iul. Thee and thy Power, if one poor syllable Could win me, an assurance of thy favour, I would not speake it, I desire to be The great example of thy cruelty, To whet which one, know Ferrand, I alone Can make discovery, where my Virolet is, Whose life, I know thou aym'st at, but if tortures Compell me to't, may hope of heaven for sake me; I dare thy worst. Fer. Are we contemn'd. Iul. Thou art, Thou and thy Ministers, my life is thine; But in the death, the Victory shall be mine. Pand. We have such a Mistresse here to teach us courage, That cowards might learn from her. Fer. You are slow; put on the rack. Begin the Scene thou miserable foole For so I'le make thee. Jul. 'Tis not in thy reach; I am happy in my sufferings, thou most wretched. Fer. So brave! Ile tame you yet, pluck hard villains; Is she insensible? no sigh nor groan? or is she dead? Jul. No tyrant, though I suffer More then a woman, beyond flesh and blood; Tis in a cause so honourable, that I scorn With any sign that may expresse a sorrow To shew I do repent. Fer. Confesse yet, And thou shal be safe. Jul. Tis wrapt up in my soule, From whence thou canst not force it. Fer. I will be Ten daies a killing thee. Jul. Be twenty thousand, My glory lives the longer. Ron. Tis a miracle, She tires th'executioners, And me. Fer. Unloose her, I am conquer'd, I must take Some other way; reach her my chaire, in honour Of her invincible fortitude. Ron. Will you not Dispatch the rest? Fer. When I seem mercifull, Assure thy selfe Ronvere, I am most cruell. Thou wonder of thy sex, and of this Nation, That hast chang'd my severity to mercy, Not to thy selfe alone, but to thy people, In which I do include these men, my enemies: Unbind them. Pand. This is strange. Fer. For your intent Against my life, which you dare not deny, I onely aske one service. Cam. Above hope. Fer. There rides a Pyrate neer, the Duke of Sesse, My enemy and this Countries, that in bonds Holds my deere friend Ascanio: free this friend, Or bring the Pyrats head; besides your pardon, And honour of the action, your reward Is forty thousand Ducates. And because I know that Virolet is as bold as wise, Be he your Generall, as pledge of your faith, That you wil undertake it: let this old man, And this most constant Matron stay with me; Of whom, as of my selfe, I wil be carefull; She shall direct you where her husband is. Make choice of any ship you think most useful. They are rig'd for you. Exeunt Guard, with Juliana and Pand. Bris. We with joy accept it. Cam. And wil proclaim King Ferrant mercifull. Exeunt. Ron. The mysterie of this, my Lord? or are you Chang'd in your nature? Fer. Ile make thee private to it. The lives of these weake men, and desperate woman, Would no way have secur'd me, had I took them; Tis Virolet I aime at; he has power, And knows to hurt. If they encounter Sesse, And he prove conquerour, I am assur'd They'l finde no mercy: if that they prove victors, I shall recover with my friend; his head I most desire of all men. Ron. Now I have it. Fer. Ile make thee understand the drift of all. So we stand sure, thus much for those that fall. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scæna prima. Enter Boteswain and Gunner. Bots. Ley here before the wind; up with her Canvase And let her work, the wind begins to whistle; Clap all her streamers on, and let her dance, As if she were the Minion of the Ocean. Let her bestride the billows till they rore, And curle their wanton heads. Ho, below there: Ho, ho, within. Ley her North-east, and thrust her missen out, The day grows faire and cleare, and the wind Courts us. O for a lusty saile now, to give chase to. Gun. A stubborn Barke, that wo'd but bear up to us, And change a broadside bravely. Bots. Where's the Duke? Gun. I have not seen him stir to day. Bots. O Gunner, What bravery dwels in his age, and what valour? And to his friends, what gentlenesse and bounty? How long have we been inhabitants at Sea here? Gun. Some fourteen yeers. Bots. By fourteen lives I swear then, This Element never nourisht such a Pirate; So great, so fearlesse, and so fortunate, So patient in his want, in Act so valiant. How many saile of wel man'd ships before us, As the Bonuto does the flying fish, Have we pursued and scowerd, that to outstrip us, They have been fain to hang their very shirts on? What Gallies have we bang'd, and sunke, and taken; Whose onely fraughts were fire, and stern defiance? And nothing spoke but Bullet in all these. How like old Neptune have I seen our Generall Standing ith' Poope, and tossing his steel Trident, Commanding both the Sea and Winds to serve him? Gun. His daughter too, which is the honour, Boteswain, Of all her sex; that Martiall mayd. Bots. A brave wench. Gun. How oftentimes, a fight being new begun, Has she leap'd down, and took my Linstock from me, And crying, now fly right, fir'd all my chasers? Then like the Image of the warlike Goddesse, Her Target brac'd upon her arme, her Sword drawn, And anger in her eyes, leap'd up again, And bravely hal'd the Barke. I have wondred Botswain, That in a body made so delicate, So soft for sweet embraces, so much fire, And manly soule, not starting at a danger. Bots. Her Noble father got her in his fury, And so she proves a souldier. Gun. This to I wonder at, Taking so many strangers as he does, He uses them with that respect and coolnesse, Not making prize, but onely borrowing What may supply his want: nor that for nothing; But renders back what they may stand in need of, Aud then parts lovingly: Where, if he take His Countreyman, that should be neerest to him, And stand most free from danger, he sure pays for't: He drownes or hangs the men, ransacks the Barke, Then gives her up a Bonfire to his fortune. Bots. The wrongs he has receiv'd from that dull Countrey, That's all I know has purchas'd all his cruelty. We fare the better; cheerly, cheerly boys, The ship runs merrily; my Captain's melancholy, And nothing cures that in him but a Sea-fight: I hope to meet a faile boy, and a right one. Gun. That's my hope too; I am ready for the pastime. Bots. I'th mean time let's bestow a song upon him, To shake him from his dumps, and bid good day to him. Ho, in the hold. Enter a Boy. Boy. Here, here. Botes. To th'main top boy. And thou kenst a ship that dares defie us, Here's Gold. Boy. I am gon. Exit Boy. Bots. Come sirs, a queint Levet. Trump. a levet. To waken our brave Generall. Then to our labour. Enter Duke of Sesse above and his duaghter Martia like an Amazon. Sess. I thank you loving mates; I thank you all. There's to prolong your mirth, &amp; good morrow to you. Daugh. Take this from me, you'r honest valiant friends; And such we must make much of. Not a sayle stirring? Gun. Not any within ken yet. Botes. Without doubt Lady, The wind standing so faire and full upon us, We shall have sport anon. But noble Generall, Why are you still so sad? you take our edge off; You make us dull, and spirit-lesse. Sess. Ile tell ye, Because I will provoke you to be fortunate; For when you know my cause, twill double arme you. This woman never knew it yet; my daughter, Some discontents she has. Daugh. Pray sir go forward. Ses. These fourteen yeeres, I have stoed it here at Sea, Where the most curious thought could never find it. Bots. Call up the Master, and all the Mates. Enter below the Master and Saylers. Ses. Good morrow. Mast. Good morrow to our Generall, a good one, And to that Noble Lady all good wishes. Daugh. I thank you Master. Sess. Mark me, thus it is then; Which I did never think to have discovered, Till full revenge had wooed me; but to satisfie My faithfull friends, thus I cast off my burden. In that short time I was a Courtier, And followed that most hated of all Princes, Ferrant the full example of all mischiefes, Compel'd to follow to my soule a stranger, It was my chance one day to play at Chesse For some few Crowns, with a mynion of this Kings, A mean poor man, that onely serv'd his pleasures; Removing of a Rook, we grew to words; From this to hotter anger: to be short, I got a blow. Daugh. How, how my Noble father? Ses. A blow my girle, which I had soon repayd, And sunk the slave for ever, had not odds Thrust in betwixt us. I went away disgrac'd— Daugh. For honours sake not so sir. Ses. For that time, wench; But calld upon him, like a Gentleman, By many private friends; knockt at his valour, Courted his honour hourely to repaire me; And tho he were a thing my thoughts made sleight on, And onely worth the fury of my footman, Still I pursued him Nobly. Daugh. Did he escape you? My old brave father, could you sit down so coldly? Ses. Have patience, and know all. Pursued him fairly, Till I was laught at, scornd, my wrongs made may games. By him unjustly wrong'd, should be all justice, The slave protected; yet at length I found him, Found him, when he suppos'd all had been buried; And what I had received durst not be questioned; And then he fell, under my Sword he fell, For ever sunk; his poore life, like the ayre, Blown in an empty bubble, burst, and left him, No Noble wind of memory to raise him. But then began my misery, I fled; The Kings frowns following, and my friends dispaires; No hand that durst relieve: my Countrey fearfull, Basely and weakly fearfull of a tyrant; Which made his bad will worse, stood still and wondred, Their vertues bedrid in e'm; then my girle, A little one, I snatch'd thee from thy nurse, The modell of thy fathers miseries: And some small wealth was fit for present carriage, And got to Seal; where I profest my anger, And wil do, whilst that base ungratefull Countrey, And that bad King, have blood or means to quench me. Now ye know all. Mast. We know all, and admire all; Go on and do all still, and still be fortunate. Daught. Had you done lesse, or lost this Noble anger, You had been worthy then mens empty pities, And not their wonders. Go on, and use your justice; And use it still with that fell violence It first appeared to you; if you go lesse, Or take a doting mercy to protection, The honour of a father I disclaim in you, Call back all duty, and will be prowder of The infamous and base name of a whore, Then daughter to a great Duke and a coward. Sess. Mine own sweet Martia, no; thou knowst my nature, It cannot, must not be. Daugh. I hope it shal not. But why sir, do you keep alive still young Ascanio, Prince of Rossana, King Ferrants most belov'd one, You took two moneths agoe? Why is not he flung overboord, or hang'd? Ses. Ile tell thee girle: It were a mercy in my nature now, So soon to break the bed of his afflictions; I am not so far reconcil'd yet to him To let him die, that were a benefit. Besides, I keep him as a bayt and dyet, To draw on more, and neerer to the King, I look each hour to heare of his Armados, And a hot welcome they shall have. Daugh. But hark you? If you were overswayed with oddes— Ses. I find you: I would not yield; no girle, no hope of yeelding, Nor fling my self one houre into their mercies, And give the tyrant hope to gain his Kingdom. No, I can sink wench, and make shift to die; A thousand doores are open, I shal hit one. I am no niggard of my life, so it goe Nobly: All waies are equall and all houres; I care not. Daugh. Now you speak like my father. Mast. Noble General, If by our means they inherit ought but bangs, The mercy of the main yard light upon us. No, we can sinke too sir, and sinke low enough, To pose their cruelties, to follow us: And he that thinks of life, if the world go that way, A thousand cowards suck his bones. Gun. Let the worst come, I can unbreech a Canon, and without much help Turn her into the Keele; and when she has split it, Every man knows his way, his own prayers, And so good night I think. Mast. We have liv'd all with you, Boy a top. And will die with you Generall. Sess. I thank you Gentlemen. Boy above. A Sayle, a Sayle. Mast. A cheerfull sound. Boy. A Sayle. Bots. Of whence? of whence boy? Boy. A lusty sayle. Daugh. Look right, and look again. Boy. She plows the Sea before her, And fomes i'th mouth. Bots. Of whence? Boy. I ken not yet sir. Sess. O may she prove of Naples. Mast. Prove the Divell, We'l spit out sire as thick as she. Boy. Hoy. Mast. Brave boy. Boy. Of Naples Naples, I think of Naples, Master, Me thinks I see the Armes. Mast. Up, up another, And give more certain signes. Exit Saylor. Sess. All to your businesse, And stand but right and true— Bots. Hang him that halts now. Boy. Sh'as us in chase. Mast. We'l spare her our main top-saile, He shall not look us long, we are no starters. Down with the fore-saile too, we'l spoom before her. Mart. Gunner, good noble Gunner, for my honour Load me but these two Minions in the chape there; And load 'em right, that they may bid faire welcome, And be thine eye and level as thy heart is. Gun. Madam, Ile scratch 'em out, Ile pisse 'em out else. Sayl. above. Ho. Sess. Of whence now? Sayl. Of Naples, Naples, Naples. I see her top flag how she quarters Naples. I heare her Trumpets. Sess. Down, she's welcome to us. Exit Mast. Bots. Gun. Sayl. Every man to his charge, man her i'th bowe wel. And place your rakers right, daughter be sparing. Mart. I sweare Ile be above sir, in the thickest, And where most danger is, Ile seek for honour. They have begun, harke how their Trumpets call us. Hark how the wide mouth'd Cannons sing amongst us. Heark how they saile; out of our shels for shame sir. Sess. Now fortune and my cause. Mart. Be bold and conquer. Exit. Charge Trumpets and shot within. Enter Master, and Boteswain. Mast. They'l board us once again; they'r tuffe &amp; valiant. Botes. Twice we have blown 'em into th'ayre like feathers. And made 'em dance. Mast. Good boys, fight bravely, manly. Enter Gunner. They come on yet; clap in her stern, &amp; yoke 'em. Gun. You shall not need, I have provision for 'em; Let 'em boord once again; the next is ours. Stand bravely to your Pikes, away, be valiant. I have a second course of service for 'em, Shall make the bowels of their Barke ake, boy The Duke fights like a Dragon. Who dares be idle. Exit. Charge, Trumpets, pieces goe off. Enter Master, Boteswaine following. Mast. Down with 'em, stow 'em in. Bots. Cut their throats, tis brotherhood to fling 'em into the Sea. The Duke is hurt, so is his lovely daughter Martia. We have the day yet. Enter Gunner. Gun. Pox fire 'em, they have smok'd us, never such plumbs yet flew. Bots. They have rent the ship, &amp; bor'd a hundred holes, She swims still lustily. Mast. She made a brave fight, and she shall be cur'd, And make a braver yet. Gun. Bring us some Cans up, I am hot as fire. Enter Boy with 3 Cans. Botes. I am sure I am none o'th coolest. Gun. My Cannons rung like Bels. Here's to my Mistris. The dainty Sweet brasse Minion, split their fore-mast, She never failed. Mast. Ye did all well, and truly, like faithfull honest men. Botes. But is she rich Master? Trumpet flourish. Enter Sesse, Martia, Virolet, Saylors. Mast. Rich for my Captains purpose howsoever, And we are his. How bravely now he shows, Heated in blood and anger? how do you sir? Not wounded mortally I hope? Sess. No Master, but onely weare the livery of fury. I am hurt, and deep. Mast. My Mistris too? Mart. A scratch man, My needle would ha done as much good sir, Be provident and carefull. Sess. Prethee peace girle, This wound is not the first blood I have blusht in, Ye fought all like tall men, my thanks among ye, That speaks not what my purse means, but my tongue, souldiers. Now sir, to you that sought me out, that found me, That found me what I am, the Tyrants Tyrant; You that were imp'd the weak arme to his folly, You are welcome to your death. Vir. I do expect it, And therefore need no complement, but waite it. Sess. Thou bor'st the face once of a Noble Gentleman, Rankt in the first file of the vertuous, By every hopefull spirit, shewed and pointed, Thy Countries love; one that advanc'd her honour, Not taynted with the base and servile uses The Tyrant ties mens soules too. Tell me Uirolet, If shame have not forsook thee, with thy credit. Uir. No more of these Racks; what I am I am. I hope not to go free with poore confessions; Nor if I show ill, will I seem a monster, By making my mind prisoner; do your worst. When I came out to deale with you, I cast it, Onely those base inflictions fit for slaves, Because I am a Gentleman. Sess. Thou art none. Thou wast while thou stoodst good, th'art now a villain And agent for the divell. Uir. That tongue lies. Give me my Sword again, and stand all arm'd; Ile prove it on ye all, I am a Gentleman, A man as faire in honour; rate your prisoners; How poore and like a Pedagogue it shews? How far from Noblenesse? tis fair, you may kil's; But to defame your victory with foule language. Ses. Go, fling him overboord; Ile teach you sirra. Uir. You cannot teach me to die. I could kill you now With patience, in despising all your cruelties. And make you choke with anger. Ses. Away I say. Mar. Stay sir, h'as given you such bold language, I am not reconcil'd to him yet, and therefore He shall not have his wish observ'd so neerly, To die when he please; I beseech you stay sir. Ses. Do with him what thou wilt. Mar. Carry him to th'Bilboes, And clap him fast there, with the Prince. Viro. Do Lady, For any death you give, I am bound to blesse you. Exit Virolet, and Saylors. Mar. Now to your Cabin, sir; pray lean upon me, And take your rest, the Surgeons waite all for you. Ses. Thou makest me blush to see thee bear thy fortuns; Why, sure I have no hurt, I have not fought sure? Mast. You bleed apace, Sir. Mart. Ye grow cold too. Ses. I must be ruld, no leaning, My deepest wounds scorn Crutches. All. A brave Generall. Flor. Trumpets, Cornets. Exeunt omnes. Enter two Saylors. 1 Sayl. Will they not moore her? 2 Sayl. Not till we come to the Fort, This is too weak a place for our defences, The Carpenters are hard at worke; she swims well, And may hold out another fight. The ship we took Burns there to give us light. 1 Sayl. She made a brave fight. 2 Sayl. She put us all in feare. 1 Sayl. Beshrew my heart did she. Her men are gone to Candy, they are pepper'd, All but this prisoner. 2 Sayl. Sure he's a brave fellow. 1 Say. A stubborn knave, but we have pul'd his bravery. He discovers Virolet and Ascanio in the Bilboes. Look how he looks now: come let's go serve his dyet, Which is but bread and water. 2 Sayl. He'l grow fat on't. Exeunt Saylors. Ascan. I must confesse I have endured much misery, even almost to the ruine of my spirit, But ten times more grows my affliction, To finde my friend here. Viro. Had we serv'd our Countrey, Or honesties, as we have serv'd our follies, We had not been here now? Ascan. Tis to true Virolet. Viro. And yet my end in ventring for your safety, Pointed at more then Ferrants will, a base one; Some service for mine own, some for my Nation, Some for my friend; but I am rightly payd, That durst adventure such a Noble office, From the most treacherous command of mischiefe; You know him now? Ascan. And when I neerer knew him, Then when I waited, Heaven be witnesse with me, (And if I lie my miseries still load me) With what teares I have woed him, with what prayers, What weight of reasons I have layd, what dangers; Then, when the peoples curses flew like storms; And every tongue was whetted to defame him, To leave his doubts, his tyrannies, his slaughters, His fell oppressions. I know I was hated too. Viro. And all mankind that knew him: these confessions Do no good to the world, to Heaven they may. Let's study to die well, we have liv'd like coxcombs. Ascan. That my mis-fortune, should lose you too. Viro. Yes; And not onely me, but many more, and better: For my life, tis not this; or might I save yours, And some brave friends I have engag'd, let me go; It were the meritorious death I wish for, But we must hang or drown like whelps. Ascan. No remedy. Viro. On my part I expect none. I know the man, And know he has been netled to the quick too, I know his nature. Ascan. A most cruell nature. Vir. His wrongs have bred him up. I cannot blame him. Ascan. He has a daughter too, the greatest scorner, And most insulter upon misery. Viro. For those, they are toyes to laugh at, not to lead men: A womans mirth or anger, like a meteor Glides and is gone, and leaves no crack behind it; Our miseries would seem like masters to us, And shake our manly spirits into feavors, If we respected those; the more they glory, And raise insulting Trophies on our ruines; The more our vertues shine in patience. Sweet Prince, the name of death was never terrible To him that knew to live; nor the loud torrent Of all afflictions, singing as they swim, A gall of heart, but to a guilty conscience: Whilst we stand faire, but by a two-edg'd storm, We find untimely fals, like early Roses; But to the earth, we beare our native sweetnesse. Ascan. Good sir go on. Viro. When we are little children, And cry and fret for every toy comes crosse us; How sweetly do we shew, when sleep steales on us? When we grow great, but our affections greater, And struggle with this stubborn twin, born with us; And tug and pull, yet still we finde a Giant: Had we not then the priviledge to sleep, Our everlasting sleep? he would make us ideots; The memory and monuments of good men Are more then lives, and tho their Tombs want tongues, Yet have they eyes, that daily sweat their losses; And such a teare from stone, no time can value. To die both young and good, are natures curses, As the world says; ask truth, they are bountious blessings: For then we reach at Heaven, in our full vertues, And fix our selves new Stars, crown'd with our goodnes. Asc. You have double arm'd me. Srange Musick within, Hoboys. Hark, what noyse is this? What horrid noyse is the Sea pleas'd to sing, A hideous Dirg to our deliverance? Viro. Stand fast now. Within strange cries, horrid noyse, Trumpets. Asc. I am fixt. Viro. We feare ye not. Enter Martia Let death appear in all shapes, we smile on him. Asc. The Lady now. Viro. The face oth' Maske is alter'd. Asc. What will she doe? Viro. Do what she can, I care not. Asc. She looks on you sir. Viro. Rather she looks through me, But yet she stirs me not. Mart. Poore wretched slaves, Why do you live? or if ye hope for mercy, Why do not you houle out, and fill the hold With lamentations, cries, and base submissions, Worthy our scorn? Viro. Madam, you are mistaken; We are no slaves to you, but to blind fortune; And if she had her eyes, and durst be certain, Certain our friend, I would not bow unto her; I would not cry, nor aske so base a mercy: If you see any thing, in our appearance, Worthy your sexes softnes and your own glory? Do it for that; and let that good reward it: We cannot beg. Mart. Ile make you beg, and bow too. Viro. Madam for what? Mart. For life; and when you hope it, Then will I laugh and triumph on your basenesse. Asc. Madam tis true, there may be such a favour, And we may aske it too; aske it with honour; And thanke you for that favour, nobly thank you, Tho it be death; but when we beg a base life, And beg it of your scorn— Viro. Y'are couzened woman, Your handsomnesse may do much, but not this way; But for your glorious hate— Mart. Are ye so stubborn? Death, I will make you bow. Vir. It must be in your bed then; There you may worke me to humility. Mart. Why, I can kill thee. Viro. If you do it handsomely; It may be I can thank you, else— Mart. So glorious? Asca. Her cruelty now workes. Mart. Yet woot thou? Virt. No. Mart. Wilt thou for life sake? Viro. No, I know your subtilty. Mart. For honour sake? Viro. I will not be a Pageant, My mind was ever firm, and so Ile lose it. Mart. Ile starve thee to it. Viro. Ile starve my selfe, and crosse it. Mart. Ile lay thee on such miseries— Viro. Ile weare 'em, And with that wantonnesse, you do your Bracelets. Mart. Ile be a moneth a killing thee. Viro. Poore Lady, Ile be a moneth a dying then: what's that? There's many a Callenture outdoes your cruelty. Mart. How might I do, in killing of his body, To save his Noble mind? Who waites there? Enter a Saylor with a rich Cap and Mantle. Sayl. Maddam. Mart. Unbolt this man, and leave those things behind you, And so away. Now put 'em on. Uunbolt him. Exit Sailor. Viro. To what end? Mart. To my end, to my will. Viro. I will. Mart. I thank you. Viro. Nay, now you thank me, Ile do more. Ile tell ye, I am a servant to your curtesie, And so far will be wooed: but if this triumph Be onely aym'd, to make your mischiefe glorious; Lady, y'ave put a richer shroud upon me, Which my strong mind shall suffer in. Mart. Come hither, And all thy bravery put into thy carriage, For I admire thee. Viro. Whither will this woman? Asc. Take heed my friend. Mart. Look as thou scorndst my cruelty: I know thou doest. Vir. I never fear'd, nor flatter'd. Mart. No if thou hadst, thou hadst died, &amp; I had gloried. I suffer now, and thou which art my prisoner, Hast Nobly won the free power to despise me. I love thee, and admire thee for thy Noblenesse; And for thy manly sufferance, am thy servant. Vir. Good Lady, mock me not. Mart. By Heaven I love thee; And by the soule of love, am one piece with thee. Thy mind, thy mind; thy brave, thy manly mind: That like a Rock stands all the storms of fortune, And beats 'em roaring back they cannot reach thee: That lovely mind I dote on, not the body; That mind has rob'd me of my liberty: That mind has darken'd all my bravery, And into poor despis'd things, turn'd my angers. Receive me to your love sir, and instruct me; Receive me to your bed, and marry me: Ile wait upon you, blesse the houre I knew you. Viro. Is this a new way? Mart. If you doubt my faith. First take your liberty; Ile make it perfect, Or any thing within my power. Viro. I love you; But how to recompence your love with marriage? Alas, I have a wife. Mart. Dearer then I am? That will adventure so much for your safety? Forget her fathers wrongs, quit her own honour, Pull on her for a strangers sake, all curses? Vir. Shall this Prince have his freedom too? Else all I love is gone, all my friends perish. Mart. He shall. Vir. What shall I do? Mart. If thou despise my curtesie, When I am dead, for griefe I am forsaken, And no soft hand left to asswage your sorrows; Too late, but too true, curse your own cruelties. Ascan. Be wise; if she be true, no thred is left else, To guide us from this laborinth of mischiefe; Nor no way for our friends. Viro. Thus then, I take you: I bind ye to my life, my love. Mart. I take you, And with the like bond tye my heart your servant; W'are now almost at Harbour, within this houre, In the dead watch, Ile have the long boat ready; And when I give the word, be sure you enter, Ile see ye furnisht both immediately, And like your selfe; some trusty man shall wait you, The watch Ile make mine own; onely my love Requires a stronger vow, which Ile administer Before we go. Viro. Ile take it to confirm you. Mart. Go in, there are the Keys, unlock his fetters, And arme ye Nobly both; Ile be with you presently, And so this loving kisse. Ascan. Be constant Lady. Exeunt omnes. Enter the Duke of Sesse by Torchlight, Master and Surgeon, with him. Surg. You grow so angry sir, your wound goes backward. Sess. I am angry at the time, at none of you, That sends but one poor subject for revenge; I would have all the Court, and all the villany, Was ever practiz'd under that foule Ferrand Tyrant, and all to quench my wrath. Mast. Be patient, Your grace may find occasion every houre, For certaine they will seeke you, to satisfy, And to the full, your anger. Ses. Death, they dare not: They know that I command death, feed his hunger, And when I let him loose— Sur. You'l never heale sir, If these extreames dwell in you, you are old, And burn your spirits out with this wild angers. Ses. Thou liest, I am not old, I am as lusty And full of manly heat as them, or thou art. Mast. No more of that. Ses. And dare seek out a danger; And hold him at the swords point, when thou tremblest And creepest into thy box of salves to save thee. O Master, I have had a dreadfull dream to night! Me-thought the ship was all on fire, and my lov'd Daughter, To save her life, leapt into th'Sea; where suddainly A stranger snatch'd her up, and swom away with her. Mast. 'Twas but the heate o'th fight sir. Boateswain within &amp; Sailor. Botes. Look out, what's that? Sail. The long bote as I live. Bote. Ho, there, ith long Bote. She claps on all her Oares. Ses. What noise is that? Hoy. Mast. I hear sir— Exit Master. Boats. The devill or his dam; haile her agen boyes. Ssail. The long boate, ho, the long boate. Ses. Why, the long boate? Where is the long Boate? Boat. She is stolne off. En. Master. Ses. Who stole her? O my prophetique soule! Mast. Your daughter's gone sir; The prisoners, and six Saylors, rogues. Ses. Mischief, six thousand plagues sale with 'em; They'r in her yet, make out. Mast. We have ne'r a Boate. En. Gunner. Gun. Who knew of this trick? Ses. Weigh Anchors and away. Boat. We ha' no winde sir, They'l beate us with their Oares. Ses. Then sinke 'em Cunner, O sink 'em, sink 'em, sink 'em, claw 'em Gunner; As ever thou hast lov'd me. Gun. I'le do reason, But i'le be hangd before I hurt the Lady. Exit Gun. Ses. Who knew of this? Trump a peece or two go off. Mast. We stand all clear. Ses. What divel Put this base trick into her tayle? my daughter, And run away with rogues! I hope she's sunk, A peece or two. Or torne to pieces with the shot; rots find her, The leprosy of whore, stick ever to her, En. Gunner. O she has ruind my revenge. Gun. She is gone sir, I cannot reach her with my shot. Ses. Rise winds, blow till you burst the aire, Blow till ye burst the aire, and swell the Seas, That they may sink the starres, O dance her, dance her; Shes impudently wanton, dance her, dance her, Mount her upon your surges, coole her, coole her She runs hot like a whore, coole her, coole her; O now a shot to sink her; come, cut Cables; I will away, and where she sets her foote Although it be in Ferrants court, ile follow her, And such a fathers vengeance shall she suffer— Dare any man stand by me? Mast. All, all. Boats. All sir. Gun. And the same cup you taste. Ses. Cut Cables then; For I shall never sleep, nor know what peace is, Till I have pluckt her heart out; All within. O maine there. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius. Scœna prima. Enter Ferrant, Ronvere, Castruchio, Villo, and Guard. Ron. You are too gentle sir. Florish cornets. Fer. You are too carelesse: The creatures I have made, no way regard me: VVhy should I give you names, titles of honour Rob families, to fill your private houses For your advancement, draw all curses on me, VVake tedious winter nights, to make them happy That for me break no slumber? Ron. VVhat we can, VVe dare doe Fer. VVhy is your Soveraignes life then (In which you live, and in whose fall your honours, Your wealth, your pomp, your pride and all must suffer) No better guarded? O my cruell Stars, That marke me out a King, raising me on This pinnacle of greatnesse, only to be The neerer blasting! Vil. VVhat think you now Castruchio? Is not this a merry life? Cast. Still thou art couzend; It is a glorious royall discontentment; How bravely it becomes him! Fer. To be made The common butt, for every slave to shoot at; No peace, no rest I take, but their alarams Beat at my heart: why do I live, or seek then, To adde a day more to these glorious troubles? Or to what end when all I can arrive at, Is but the summing up of feares and sorrowes, VVhat power has my command, when from my bosom Ascanio my most dear, and lov'd Ascanio, Was snatch'd, spite of my wil, spite of my succor, And by mine own proud slave reteind most miserable? And still that villains lives to nip my pleasures, It being not within my power to reach him. Ron. Time may restore all this; and would you hear VVhose counsell never faild you. Fer. Tell me no more, I faint beneath the burthen of my cares, And yeild my selfe most wretched. Ron. On my Knees I beg it might sir, vouchsafe me hearing. Fer. Speak, speak, and I thus low, such is my fortune, VVill hear what thou canst say. Vil. Look but on this, Has not a man that has but means to keep A Hawk, a Grayhound, and a hunting Nag, More pleasure then this King? Cast. A dull foole still, Make me a King, and let me scratch with care, And see who'l have the better; give me rule, Command, obedience, pleasure of a King, And let the devil rore; The greatest corrosive A King can have, is of more pretious tickling, And handled to the height more dear delight, Then other mens whole lives, let 'em be safe too. Uil. Think of the mutinous people. Cast. Hang the people, Give me the pleasure, let me do all, awe all, Enjoy their wives and states at my discretion, And peg 'em when I please, let the slaves mumble. Vil. But say they should be vex'd, and rise against thee? Cast. Let 'em rise, let 'em rise: give me the bridle here, And see if they can crack my girths: ah Villio, Under the Sun, ther's nothing so voluptuous As riding of this monster, till he founder. Fer. VVho's that so lowd? Cast. I am dumb: is not this rare? Kings looks make Pythagoreans; is not this A happinesse Villio? Vil. Yes, to put to silence A fawning sycophant. Fer. Thou speak'st truth in all, And mercy is a vice, when there needs rigour, VVhich I with all severity will practise; And since as subjects they pay not obedience, They shall be forc'd as slaves: I wil remove Their meanes to hurt, and with the means, my fears: Goe you the fatall executioners Of my commands, and in our name proclame, That from this houre I do forbid all meetings, All private conferences in the City: To feast a neighbour shall be death; to talke, As they meete in the streetes, to hold discourse, By writing, nay by signes; see this perform'd, And I wil call your cruelty, to those That dare repine at this, to me true service. 1 Gard. This makes for us. 2. Gard. I now we have imployments, If we grow not rich 'twere fit we should be beggers. Fer. Ronvere. Exit Guard. Ron. My Lord. Cast. Thou enemy to Majesty? VVhat think'st thou of a Kingdome? Uil. As of a man That hath power to doe ill. Cast. Of a thing rather That does divide an Empire with the Gods; Observe but with how little breath he shakes A populous City, which would stand unmov'd Against a whirlewind. Uil. Then you make him more Then him that rules the winds. Cast. For me I doe professe it, Were I offerd to be any thing on Earth, I would be mighty Ferrant. Fer. Ha? who names me? Deliver thy thoughts slave, thy thoughts, and truly, Or be no more. Cast. They rather will deserve. Your favour then your fury; I admire, (As who does not, that is a loyall subject?) Your wisdom, power, your perfect happinesse, The most blest of mankind. Fer. Didst thou but feele The weighty sorrowes, that sit on a Crown, Tho thou shouldst find one in the streets Castruchio, Thou wouldst not think it worth the taking up; But since thou art enamour'd of my fortune, Thou shalt ere long taste of it. Cast. But one day, And then let me expire. Fer. Goe to my wardrop, And of the richest things I wear, cull out, What thou thinkst fit: do you attend him sirra. Uil. I warrant you, I shall be at his elbow, The foole wil never leave him. Exit Cast. Uillio. Cast. Made for ever. A shout within. Fer. What shout is that? draw up Guards. Ron. Those rather En. Uirolet, Ascanio, and a servant. Speak joy then danger. Bring her to my house, I would not have her seen here. Fer. My Ascanio! The most desir'd of all the men, let me die In these embraces; how wert thou redeem'd? Asc. Sir, this is my preserver. Fer. At more leasure, I will inquire the manner, and the meanes, I cannot spare so much time now from my More strickt embraces: Uirolet, welcome too, This service weighes down your entended treason; You long have bin mine enemy, learn now To be my friend and loyall, I aske no more, And live as free as Ferrant; let him have The forty thousand crowns I gladly promis'd, For my Ascanios freedom, and deliver His Father, and his wife to him in safety, Something hath passed which I am sorry for, But 'twill not now be help'd; come my Ascanio, And reap the harvest of my winter travels. My best Ascanio, my most lov'd Ascanio. Florish Cornets. Uiro. My Lord, all former passages forgot, Exit Fer. Ascanio. I am become a suitor. Ron. To me Uirolet? Uirol. To you, yet will not beg the courtesie, But largely pay you for it. Ron. To the purpose. Uirol. The forty thousand crownes the King hath given me, I will bestow on you, if by your meanes I may have liberty for a divorce Between me and my wife. Ron. Your Julicana? That for you hath indur'd so much, so nobly? Uirol. The more my sorrow; but it must be so. Ron. I will not hinder it: without a bribe, For mine own ends, I would have further'd this. I will use all my power. Uirol. 'Tis all I aske: Oh my curs'd fate, that ever man should hate Himselfe for being belov'd, or be compeld To cast away a Jewell, Kings would buy, Tho with the losse of Crown and Monarchy! Exeunt. Enter Sesse, Master, Boatswaine, Gunner. Ses. How do I look? Mast. You are so strangely alterd, We scarce can know you, so young againe, and utterly From that you were, figure, or any favour; Your friends cannot discern you. Ses. I have none, None but my faire revenge, and let that know me! You are finely alterd too. Boats. To please your humour, But we may passe without disguise, our living Was never in their element. Gun. This Jew sure, That alter'd you, is a made knave. Ses. O! a most excellent fellow. Gun. How he has mew'd your head, has rub'd the show off, And run your beard into a peak of twenty! Boat. Stopt all the crannies in your face. Mast. Most rarely. Boat. And now you look as plump, your eyes as sparkling, As if you were to leap into a Ladies saddle. Has he not set your nose awry? Ses. The better. Boat. I think it be the better, but tis awry sure; North and by East. I ther's the point it stands in; Now halfe a point to th'Southward. Ses. I could laugh, But that my businesse requires no mirth now; Thou art a merry fellow. Boat. I would the Jew sir, Could steer my head right, for I have such a swimming in't, Ever since I went to Sea first. Mast. Take wine and purg it. Boate. I have had a thousand pils of Sack, a thousand; A thousand pottle pils. Gun. Take more. Boate. Good Doctor, En. Citizens, severally. Your patient is easily perswaded. Mast. The next faire open weather Me thinks this Jew, If he were truly known to founder'd Courtiers, And decaied Ladies, that have lost their fleeces On every bush, he might pick a pretty living. Boate. The best of all our gallants, now be glad of him; For if you marke their marches, they are tender, Soft, soft, and tender; then but observe their bodies, And you shall find 'em cemented by a Surgeon, Or some Physitian for a year or two, And then to th'tub again, for a new pickle. This Jew might live a Gentile here. En. 2. Citizens at both dores, saluting afar off. Ses. What are these? Stand close and marke? Boat. These are no men, th'are motions. Ses. What sad and ruthfull faces! Boate. How they duck! This sencelesse, silent courtesie me thinks, Shewes like two Turkes, saluting one another, Upon two French porters backs. Ses. They are my Countrymen, And this, some forc'd infliction from the tyrant; What are you? why is this? why move thus silent As if you were wandring shadowes? why so sad? Your tongues seald up; are yee of severall Countries? You understand not one another? Gun. That's an English man, He lookes as though he had lost his dog. Ses. Your habits Shew ye all Neapolitanes, and your faces Deliver you oppressed things: speak boldly: Do you groan, and labor under this stiffe yoak? Mast. They shake their heads and weep. Ses. O misery! Give plenteous sorrow, and no tongues to shew 'em! This is a studied cruelty. 1. Citi. Be gon sir, It seemes you are a stranger and your selfe; 2. Citi. You wonder here at us, as much we wonder To hear you speak so openly, and boldly, The Kings command being publisht to the contrary; Tis death here, above two to talk together; And that must be but common salutation neither, Short and so part. Boate. How should a man buy mustard, If he be forc'd to stay the making of it? Within 1. Cleare all the streetes before the King: 1. Cit. Get off Sir, And shift as we must do. Exeunt Citizens Ses. I'le see his glory. Mast. Stand fast now and like men, Flourish colours. Cast. Begin the game sir, En. Castrucrio like the King, in the midst of a gard. Uillio. And pluck me down, the Row Of houses there. They hide the view oth' hill; and sink those merchants, Their ships are foule and stinke. Mast. This is a sweete youth. Cast. All that are taken in assemblies, Their houses and their wives, their wealthes are foreit, Their lives at your devotion. Villaines, Knaves, I'le make you bow &amp; shake, i'le make you kneele Rogues. How brave tis to be a King? Gun. Here's fine tumbling. Cast. No man shall sit i'th' temple neer another. Boate. Nor lie with his own wife. Cast. All upon paine Of present death, forget to write. Boate. That's excellent, Carriers and foot-Posts, wil be arrant Rebels. Cast. No Character, or stamp that may deliver This mans intention, to that man i'th' Country. Gun. Nay, an you cut off, after my hearty commendations Your friend and Oliver. No more. Cast. No man smile, And wear a face of mirth; that fellowes comming, And hides a double heart, he's your prize, smoke him. Enter Uirolet, Ronvero, Ascanio, and Martia, Passing over. Ses. What base abuse is this? Ha? tis her face sure, My prisoners with her too? by heaven wild whore Now is my time. Mast. Do what you will. Ses. Stay hold yet. My Country shall be serv'd first, let her go, Wee'l have an hour for her to make her tremble. Now shew your selves, and blesse you with your valors. Guard. Here's a whole plump of Rogues. Uirolet and they off againe. Ses. Now for your Country. Cast. Away with 'em and hang 'em; no, no mercy, I say no mercy. Ses. Be it so upon 'em. Guard. Treason, treason, treason. Boate. Cut the slaves to giggets. Gun. Down with the bul-beefes. Ses. Hold, hold, I command you—look here Cast. A miserable thing I am no King sir. Ses. Sirra, your fooles face has preserv'd your life. Wear no more Kings coates, you have scap'd a scouring. Boate. I'st not the King. Ses. No, tis a prating Rascall, The puppy makes him mirth. Cast. Yes sir, I am a puppy. Boate. I beseech you let me hang him, I'le do't in my belt straight. Cast. As you are honorable, It is enough you may hang me. Gun. I'le hang a squib at's taile That shall blow both his buttocks, like a petar. Cast. Do any thing. But do not kill me Gentlemen. Enter Citizen. Boate. Lets flea him, and have him flye blowen. Cit. Away, and save your lives. The King himselfe is comming on: if you stay, You are lost for ever; let not so much noblenesse Willfully perish. Sess. How neer? 2. Citiz. He's here behind you. Ex. Sess. Boatsw. Saylers, Citizens. Sess. We thank you. vanish. Enter Ferand. Ronvere. Florish Cornets. Fer. Double the Guards and take in men that dare, These slaves are frighted; where are the proud Rebels, To what protection fled, what villain leads 'em? Under our nose distur'b our rest? Ronver. We shall heare, For such a search I have sent, to hunt the Traytors. Fer. Yet better men I say, we stand too open: How now Castruchio? how do you like our glory? Cast. I must confesse, 'twas somewhat more then my match Sir; This open glory agrees not with my body, But if it were ith' Castle, or some strength, Where I might have my swing. Vil. You have been swing'd brother; How these delights have tickled you? you itch yet; Will you walke out again in pomp? Cast. Good Foole. Vil. These rogues must be rebuked, they are too sawcy, These peremptory Knaves. Will you walk out Sir, And take the remnant of your Coronation? The people stay to see it. Fer. Do not vex him; Ha's griefe enough in's bones; you shall to th'Citadell, And like my selfe command, there use your pleasure, But take heed to your person. Vil. The more danger; Still the more honour Brother. Cast. If I reign not then, And like a King, and thou shalt know it fool, And thou shalt feel it foole. Vil. Fooles still are freemen, I'le sue for a protection, till thy reigne's out. Fer. The people have abus'd the liberty I late allowed, I now proclaime it straighter, No men shall walk together, nor salute; For they that doe shall dye. Ronver. You hit the right Sir; That liberty cut off, you are free from practise. Fer. Renew my guards. Ronver. I shall. Fer. And keep strict watches; One houre of joy I aske. Ronver. You shall have many. Exeunt. Flor. Cor. Pandulfo, and Iuliana, led by two of the guard, as not yet fully recover'd. 1. Guard. You are now at liberty, in your own house Lady, And here our charge takes end. Pandul. 'Tis now a Custome. We must even wooe those men deserve worst of us, And so we thanke your labours; there's to drinke, For that, and mischiefe are your occupations; And to meane well to no man, you Chief'st harvests. 2. Gard. You give liberally; we hope Sir, er't be long, To be oftner acquainted with your bounty, And so we leave you. Pand. Doe, for I dote not on ye; Iul. But where's my Husband? what should I do here? Or what share have I in this joy, cal'd liberty, Without his company? Why did you flatter me, And tell me he was return'd, his service honour'd? 1. Gard. He is so, and stands high in the Kings favour, His friends redeemd, and his own liberty, From which yours is deriv'd, confirm'd; his service, To his own wish rewarded: so fare-well Lady. Ex. Guard. Pand. Go persecute the good, and hunt ye hell-hounds; Ye Leeches of the time, suck till ye burst slaves; How does my girle? Iul. Weake yet, but full of comfort; Pand. Sit down, and take some rest; Jul. My heart's whole Father; That joyes, and leaps, to heare my Virolet, My Deer, my life, has conquer'd his afflictions. Pand. Those rude hands, and that bloody will that did this, That durst upon thy tender body Print These Characters of cruelty; heare me heaven. Iul. O Sir be sparing. Pand. I'le speake it, tho I burst; And tho the ayre had eares, and serv'd the Tyrant, Out it should goe: O heare me thou great Justice; The miseries, that waite upon their mischiefs, Let them be numberlesse, and no eye pitty Them when their soules are loaden, and in labour, And wounded through, and through, with guilt &amp; horror, As mine is now with griefe; let men laugh at 'em Then, when their monstrous sins, like earth-quaks, shake 'em; And those eyes, that forgot heaven would look upward, The bloody 'larms, of the conscience beating, Let mercy flye, and day strook into darknesse, Leave their blind soules, to hunt out their own horrors. Iul. Enough, enough, we must forget deare Father; For then we are glorious formes of heaven; and live, When we can suffer, and as soon forgive. But where's my Lord? me thinkes I have seen this house, And have been in't before. Pand. Thine own house jewell. Iul. Mine, without him? or his, without my company? I thinke it cannot be; it was not wont Father. Pand. Some businesse with the King (let it be good heaven) Reteines him sure. Enter Boy. Iul. It must be good and noble, For all men that he treats with taste of vertue; His words and actions are his own; and Honour's Not bought, nor compel'd from him. Pand. Here's the Boy. He can confirme us more, how sad the child looks? Come hither Lucio; how, and where's thy Master? Iul. Speak gentle Boy. Pand. Is he return'd in safety? Iul. If not, and that thou knowest is miserable, Our hopes and happinesse declin'd for ever; Study a sorrow, excellent as thy Master, Then if thou canst live, leave us. Lucio. Noble Madam, My Lord is safe return'd, safe to his friends, and fortune, Safe to his Country, entertain'd with honour, Is here within the house. Iul. Doe not mock me. Lucio. But such a melancholy hangs on his mind, And in his eyes inhabit such sad shadowes; But what the cause is— Pand. Goe tell him we are here Boy, There must be no cause now. Iul. Hast thou forgot me? Lucio. No, noblest Lady. Jul. Tell him I am here, Tell him his wife is here, sound my name to him, And thou shalt see him start; speake Iuliana, And like the Sunne that labors through a tempest, How suddainly he will disperse his sadnesse? Pand. Goe I command thee instantly, And charge him on his duty. Iul. On his Love Boy: I would faine goe to him. Pand. Away, away, you are foolish. Iul. Beare all my service sweet Boy. Pand. Art thou here still? Jul. And tell him what thou wilt that shall become thee. Pand. Ith' house; and know we are here. Ex. Boy. Iul. No, no, he did not; I warrant you he did not: could you think His Love had lesse then wings, had he but seen me; His strong affection any thing but fire Consuming all weak lets, and rubs before it, Till he had met my flame, and made one body? If ever heavens high blessings met in one man, And there erected to their holy uses A sacred mind, fit for their services, Built all of polisht honour, 'twas in this man: Misdoubt him not. Pand. I know he's truly noble; But why this sadnesse, when the generall cause Requires a Jubile of joy? Jul. I know not. Enter Virolet, and Boy. Pand. Pray heaven you find it not. Jul. I hope I shall not: O here he comes, and with him all my happinesse; He staies and thinks, we may be too unmannerly; Pray give him leave. they stand off. Pand. I doe not like this sadnesse. Uir. O hard condition of my misery! Unheard of plagues! when to behold that woman, That chaste and vertuous woman, that preserv'd me, That pious wife, wedded to my afflictions, Must be more terrible then all my dangers. O fortune, thou hast rob'd men of my making, The noble building of a man, demolisht, And flung me headlong, on a sin so base Man and mankind contemn; even beasts abhor it, A sin more dull then drinke, a shame beyond it; So foule, and farre from faith; I dare not name it, But it will cry it self out, loud ingratitude. Your blessing Sir. Pand. You have it in abundance; So is our joy, to see you safe. Vir. My Deere one; Iul. H'as not forgot me yet: O take me to you Sir. Uir. Must this be added to increase my misery, That she must weep for joy, and loose that goodnesse? My Iuliana, even the best of women, Of wives the perfectest, let me speak this, And with a modesty declare thy vertues, Chaster then Christall, on the Scythian Clifts The more the proud winds Court, the more the purer. Sweeter in thy obedience, then a sacrifice; And in thy mind a Saint, that even yet living, Producest miracles, and women daily With crooked and tame soules creep to thy goodnesse, Which having toucht at, they become examples. The fortitude of all their sex, is Fable Compar'd to thine; and they that fill'd up glory, And admiration, in the age behind us, Out of their celebrated urns, are started, To stare upon the greatnesse of thy spirit; Wondring what new Martyr heaven has begot, To fill the times with truth, and ease their stories: Being all these, and excellent in beauty, (For noble things dwell in the noblest buildings) Thou hast undone thy husband, made him wretch'ed, A miserable man, my Juliana, Thou hast made thy Uirolet. Iul. Now goodnesse keep me; Oh! my dear Lord. Pand. She wrong you? what's the meaning? Weep not, but speake, I charge you on obedience; Your Father charges you; she make you miserable? That you your self confesse. Uir. I doe, that kils me; And far lesse I have spoke her, then her merit. Iul. It is some sinne of weaknesse, or of Ignorance? For sure my Will— Uir. No, 'tis a sinne of excellence: Forgive me heaven, that I prophane thy blessings: Sit still; I'le shew you all. Exit Uirolet. Pand. What meanes this madnesse? For sure there is no taste of right man in it; Greives he our liberty, our preservation? Or has the greatnesse of the deed he has done, Made him forget, for whom, and how he did it, And looking down upon us, scorne the benefit? Well Uirolet if thou beest proud, or treacherous Iul. He cannot Sir, he cannot; he will shew us, And with that reason ground his words. Pand. He comes. Enter Uirolet, Martia, Ronver. What Masque is this? what admirable beauty? Pray heaven his heart be true. Iul. A goodly woman. Uir. Tell me my Dear; and tell me without flattery, As you are nobly honest, speak the truth; What thinke you of this Lady? Iul. She is most excellent. Uir. Might not this beauty tell me that it's a sweet one, Without more setting off, as now it is, Thanking no greater Mistresse then meer nature? Stagger a constant heart? Pand. She is full of wonder; But yet; yet Uirolet. Uir. Pray; by your leave Sir. Iul. She would amaze: Uir. O! would she so? I thanke you; Say, to this beauty, she have all additions, Wealth, noble birth. Pand. O hold there. Uir. All vertues, A mind, as full of Candor as the truth is, I, and a loving Lady. Iul. She must needs (I am bound in conscience to confesse) deserve much. Uir. Nay, say beyond all these, she be so pious, That even on slaves condemn'd she showre her benefits, And melt their stubborn Bolts with her soft pitty, What thinke you then? Pand. For such a noble office, At these yeares, I should dote my self; take heed Boy, Jul. If you be he, that have received these blessings, And this the Lady: love her, honour her; You cannot doe too much, to shew your gratitude, Your greatest service will shew off too slender. Uir. This is the Lady; Lady of that bounty, That wealth, that noble name, that all I spoke of: The Prince Ascaino and my selfe, the slaves Redeem'd, brought home, still guarded by her goodnes, And of our liberties you taste the sweetnes; Even you she has preserv'd too, lengthen'd your lives. Iul. And what reward doe you purpose? it must be a maine one; If love will do it we'll all, so love her, serve her. Uir. It must be my love. Iul. Ha! Vir. Mine, my onely love, My everlasting love: Pand. How? Vir. Pray have patience. The recompence she ask'd, and I have render'd. Was to become her husband: then I vowed it, And since I have made it good. Pand. Thou durst not. Virol. Done Sir. Iul. Be what you please, his happinesse yet stayes with me, You have been mine; Oh my unhappy fortune. Pand. Nay, break and dye; Iul. It cannot yet: I must live, Till I see this man, blest in his new love, And then: Pand. What hast thou done? thou base one tell me, Thou barren thing of honesty, and honour; What hast thou wrought? Is not this she, looke on her, Look on her, with the eyes of gratitude, And whipe thy false teares off; Is not this she, That three times on the Rack, to guard thy safety, When thou stood'st lost, and naked to the Tyrant; Thy aged Father here, that shames to know thee Tirant, Ingag'd ith' jawes of danger; was not this she, That then gave up her body to the torture? That tender body, that the wind sings through; And three times, when her sinewes, crack'd &amp; torter'd, The beauties of her body turn'd to ruines, Even then, within her patient heart, she lock'd thee; Then hid thee from the Tyrant; then preserv'd thee; And canst thou be that slave? Martia. This was but duty; She did it for her Husband, and she ought it; She has had the pleasure of him, many an houre; And if one minutes paine cannot be suffer'd; Mine was above all these, a nobler venter, I speake it boldly, for I lost a Father. He has one still; I left my friends, he has many; Expos'd my life, and honour to a cruelty, That if it had seiz'd on me, racks and tortures, Alas, they are Triumphs to it: and had it hit. For this mans love, it should have shewed a triumph, Twise lost, I freed him; Rossana lost before him, His fortunes with him; and his friends behind him: Twise was I rack'd my selfe for his deliverance, In honour first and name, which was a torture The Hang-man never heard of; next at Sea, In our escape, where the proud waves took pleasure To tosse my little Boat up like a Bubble, Then like meteor in the ayre he hung, Then catcht, and hug him in the depth of darknesse; The Canon from my incensed Fathers Ship, Ringing our Knell, and still as we peep'd upward, Beating the raging surge, with fire and Bullet, And I stood fixt for this mans sake, and scorn'd it; Compare but this: Vir. 'Tis too true; O my fortune! That I must equally be bound to either: Iul. You have the better, and the nobler Lady; And now I am forc'd, a lover of her goodnesse. And so far have you wrought for his deliverance, That is my Lord, so lovingly and nobly, That now me thinks I stagger in my Title. But how with honesty? for I am poor Lady, In all my dutious service but your shadow, Yet would be just; how with faire fame and credit, I may goe off; I would not be a strumpet: O my dear Sir you know: Vir. O truth, thou knowest too. Iul. Nor have the world suspect, I fell to mischiefe. Law. Take you no care for that, here's that has don it, A faire divorce, 'tis honest too. Pand. The devill, Honest? to put her off. Law. Most honest Sir, And in this point, most strong. Pand. The cause, the cause Sir? Law. A just cause too. Pand. As any is in hell, Lawyer. Law. For barrennesse, she never brought him children. Pa. Why art not thou divorc'd? thou canst not get 'em; Thy neigbours, thy rank neighbours: O base jugling, Is she not young? Iul. Woemen at more yeares Sir, Have met that blessing; 'tis in heavens high power. Law. You never can have any: Pand. Why quick Lawyer? My Philosophicall Lawyer. Law. The Rack has spoil'd her The distentions of those parts, hath stopt all fruitfulnes. Pand. O I could curse. Iul. And am I grown so miserable, That mine own pitty must make me wretched? No cause against me, but my love and duty? Farewell Sir; like obedience, thus I leave you, My long farewell: I doe not grudge, I grieve Sir, And if that be offensive, I can dye, And then you fairely free: good Lady love him; You have a noble, and an honest Gentleman, I ever found him so, the world has spoke him; And let it be your part still to deserve him: Love him no lesse then I have done; and serve him, And heaven shall blesse you; you shall blesse my ashes; I give you up the house; the name of wife, Honour, and all respect I borrowed from him, And to my grave I turn: one farewell more, Nothing divide your Loves, not want of Children, Which I shall pray against, and make you fruitfull; Grow like two equall flames, rise high and glorious; And in your honor'd age burn out together: To all I know, farewell. Ronver. Be not so griev'd Lady; A nobler fortune. Iul. Away thou parasite. Disturbe not my sad thoughts; I hate thy greatnesse. Ron. I hate not you; I am glad she's off these hinges, Come, let's pursue. Exit Ronver. and Law. Pand. If I had breath to curse thee; Or could my great heart utter; farewell villaine, Thy house, nor face agen. Exit Pand. Mar. Let 'em all goe. And now let us rejoyce; now freely take me. And now embrace me Virolet; give the rites Of a brave Husband to his love. Vir. I'le take my leave too. Mar. How, take you leave too? Vir. The house is furnish'd for you; You are Mistresse, may command. Mar. Will you to bed Sir? Vir. As soone to hell, to any thing I hate most; You must excuse me, I have kept my word. You are my wife, you now enjoy my fortune, Which I have done to recompence your bounty: But to yeeld up those chaste delights and pleasures, Which are not mine, but my first vowes. Mar. You jeast. Vir. You will not find it so, to give you those; I have divorc'd, and lost with Iuliana, And all fires of that nature. Mar. Are you a Husband; Vir. To question hers, and satisfie your flames, That held an equall beauty, equall bounty. Vir. Good heaven forgive; no, no, the strict forbearance, Of all those joyes, like a full sacrifice, I offer to the suffrings of my first love; Honour, and wealth, attendance, state, all duty, Shall waite upon your will, to make you happy; But my afflicted mind, you must give leave Lady; My weary Trunk must wander. Mart. Not enjoy me? Goe from me too? Vir. For ever thus I leave you; And how so e're I fare, live you still happy. Exit Uirol. Mar. Since I am scorn'd, I'le hate thee, scorn thy gifts too; Thou miserable fool, thou fool to pitty; And such a rude, demolisht thing, I'le leave thee, In my revenge: for foolish love, farewell now, And anger, and the spite of woman enter, That all the world shall say, that read this story, My hate, and not my love, begot my glory. Exit Martia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus Scæna prima. Enter Sess. Boatswaine, Master, Gunner. Sess. He that feares death, or tortures, let him leave me. The stops that we have met with, Crown our Conquest: Common attempts are fit for common men; The rare, the rarest spirits. Can we be daunted? We that have smil'd at Sea at certain ruines, Which men on shore; but hazarded would shake at We that have liv'd free, in despite of fortune, Laught at the out-stretch'd Arme of Tyranny, As still too short to reach us, shall we faint now? No my brave mates, I know your fiery temper, And that you can, and dare, as much as men: Calamity, that severs worldly friendships, Could ne'r divide us, you are still the same; The constant followers of my banisht fortunes; The Instruments of my revenge; the hands By which I work, and fashion all my projects. Mast. And such we will be ever. Gun. 'Slite Sir, Cramme me Into a Canons mouth, and shoot me at Proud Ferrands head; may onely he fall with me, My life I rate at nothing. Boatsw. Could I but get, Within my swords length of him; and if then He scape me, may th'account of all his sinnes Be added unto mine. Mast. 'Tis not to dye Sir, But to dye unreveng'd, that staggers me: For were your ends serv'd, and our Country free, We would fall willing sacrifices. Sess. To rise up, Most glorious Martyrs. Boats. But the reason why We weare these shapes? Sess. Onely to get accesse: Like honest men, we never shall approach him, Such are his feares, but thus attir'd like Switzers, And fashioning our language to our habits; Bold, bloody, desperate, we may be admitted Among his guard. But if this faile, I'le try A thousand others, out doe Proteus In various shapes, but I will reach his heart. And seale my anger on't. Enter Ronero and the Guard. Mast. The Lord Ronero. Boats. Shall we begin with him? Sess. He is not ripe yet, Nor fit to fall: as you see me begin, Withall care imitate. Gun. We are instructed. Boats. Would we were at it once. Ron. Keepe a strict watch, And let the guards be doubled, this last night The King had fearefull dreames. Sess. 'Tis a good Omen To our attempts. Roner. What men are these? What seek you? Sess. Imployment. Roner. Of what nature? Sess. We are Souldiers; We have seen towns and Churches set on fire; The Kennels runing blood, coy virgins ravish'd; The Altars ransack'd, and the holy reliques, Yea, and the Saints themselves, made lawfull spoyles, Unto the Conquerors: but these good dayes are past, And we made Beggars, by this Idle Peace, For want of action. I am Sir no stranger To the Government of this state, I know the King Needs men, that onely doe what he commands, And search no further: 'tis the profession Of all our Nation, to serve faithfully, Where th'are best payed: and if you entertaine us, I doe not know the thing you can command, Which we'le not put in act. Roner. A goodly Parsonage. Mast. And if you have an Enemy, or so That you would have dispatch'd. Gun. They are here, can fit you. Boats. Or if there be an Itch, though to a man, Sess. You shall tye Our consciences in your purse-strings. Roner. Gentlemen, I like your freedome: I am now in haste, But waite for my return. I like the Rascals, They may be usefull. Ses. We'l attend you Sir: Roner. Doe; and be confident of entertainment; I hope ye will deserve it. Exit Roner. and Guard. Ses. O, no doubt Sir: Thus farre we are prosperous; we'l be his guard, Till Tyranny and pride finde full reward: Exeunt. Enter Pandulfo, and Juliana. Pand. My blessing? no; a Fathers heavy curse, Pursue, and overtake him. Jul. Gentle Sir. Pand. My name, and Family; end in my self Rather then live in him. Iul. Deare Sir forbeare, A fathers curses hit far off, and kill too. And like a murthering-piece aymes not at one, But all that stand within the dangerous level. Some bullet may return upon your selfe too, Though against nature, if you still go on In this unnaturall course. Pand. Thou art not made Of that same stuffe as other women are: Thy injuries would teach patience to blaspheme; Yet still thou art a Dove. Jul. I know not malice, but like an innocent, suffer. Pand. More miraculous! Ile have a woman Chronicled, and for goodnesse, Which is the greatest wonder. Let me see, I have no sonne to inherit after me; Him I disclaime. What then? Ile make thy vertues my sole heire; Thy story Ile have written, and in Gold to; In prose and verse, and by the ablest doers: A word or two of a kind step-father Ile have put in, good Kings and Queens shal buy it. And if the actions of ill great women, And of the modern times too, are remembred, That have undone their husbands, and their families, What will our story do? It shall be so, And I wil streight about it. Exit Pand. Enter Boy. Jul. Such as love Goodnesse for glory, have it for reward; I love mine for it selfe: let innocence Be written on my Tomb, though ne're so humble, Tis all I am ambitious of. But I Forget my vows. Boy. 'Fore me, you are not modest, Nor is this Courtlike. Would you take it wel, If she should rudely presse into your Closet, When from your several Boxes you choose paint, To make a this daies face with? Jul. What's the matter? Boy. Pray know her pleasure first. Jul. To whom speak you Boy? Boy. Your Ladiships pardon. That proud Lady theife, That stole away my Lord from your embraces, (Wrinckes at two and twenty on her cheekes for't, Or Mercury unallayed, make blisters on it) Would force a visit. Jul. And dare you deny her, Or any else that I call mine? No more, Attend her with all reverence and respect; The want in you of manners, my Lord may Construe in me for malice. I wil teach you How, to esteem and love the beauty he dotes on; Prepare a banquet. Enter Martia and Boy. Madam, thus my duty Stoops to the favour you vouchsafe your servant, In honouring her house. Mart. Is this in scorn? Jul. No by the life of Virolet: give me leave To sweare by him, as by a Saint I worship, But am to know no further, my heart speaks that My servants have been rude, and this boy (doting Upon my sorrows) hath forgot his duty: In which, that you may think I have no share, Sirra, upon your knees, desire her pardon. Boy. I dare not disobey you. Mart. Prethee rise, My anger never looks so low: I thank you. And wil deserve it, If we may be private, I came to see and speak with you. Jul. Be gone. Exit Boy. Good Madam sit. Mart. I rob you of your place then. Jul. You have deserv'd a better, in my bed; Make use of this too: Now your pleasure Lady. If in your breast there be a worthy pitty, That brings you for my comfort, you do nobly: But if you come to triumph in your conquest, Or tread on my calamities, 'twil wrong Your other excellencies. Let it suffice, That you alone enjoy the best of men, And that I am forsaken. Mart. He the best? The scum and shame of mankind. Jul. Virolet, Lady? Mart. Blest in him? I would my youth had chosen Consuming feavers, bed-rid age For my companions, rather then a thing To lay whose basenesse open, would even poyson The tongue that speaks it. Jul. Certainly from you At no part he deserves this; and I tell you, Durst I pretend but the least title to him, I should not hear this. Mart. He's an impudent villaine, Or a malicious wretch: to you ungratefull; To me, beyond expression barbarous. I more then hate him; from you, he deserves A death most horrid: from me, to die for ever, And know no end of torments. Would you have comfort? Would you wash off the stain that sticks upon you, In being refus'd? Would you redeem your fame, Shipwrack'd in his base wrongs? if you desire this, It is not to be done with slavish suffering, But by a Noble anger, making way To a most brave revenge, we may call justice; Our injuries are equal; joyn with me then, And share the honour. Jul. I scarce understand you, And know I shal be most unapt to learn To hate the man I stil must love and honour. Mar. This foolish dotage in soft-hearted women, Makes proud men insolent: but take your way, Ile run another course. Jul. As you are noble, Deliver his offence. Mart. He has denied The rites due to a wife. Jul. O me most happy, How largely am I payd for all my sufferings? Most honest Virolet, thou just performer Of all thy promises: I call to mind now, When I was happy in those joyes you speak of, In a chast bed, and warranted by Law too, He oft would swear, that if he should survive 'em, (Which then I knew he wisht not) never woman Should taste of his imbraces; this one act Makes me again his debtor. Mart. And was this The cause my youth and beauty were contemn'd? If I sit down here! wel— Jul. I dare thy worst, Plot what thou canst, my piety shal guard him Against thy malice. Leave my house and quickly, Thou wilt infect these innocent walls. By vertue I wil inform him of thy bloody purpose, And turn it on thine own accursed head; Believ't I wil. Exit Juliana. Mart. But tis not in thy power To hinder what I have decreed against him. Ile set my selfe to sale, and live a strumpet; Forget my birth, my father, and his honour, Rather then want an instrument to help me Enter Ronvere. In my revenge. The Captain of the guard; Blest opportunity courts me. Ron. Sad and troubled? How brave her anger shews? how it sets off Her naturall beauty? under what happy star Was Virolet born, to be belov'd and sought to, By two incomparable women? Noblest Lady, I have heard your wrongs and pity them: and if The service of my life could give me hope To gain your favour, I should be most proud To be commanded. Mart. Tis in you, my Lord, To make me your glad servant. Ron. Name the means. Mar. Tis not preferment, Jewels, Gold, or Courtship. He that desires to reap the harvest of My youth and beauty, must begin in blood, And right my wrongs. Ron. I apprehend you Madam, And rest assur'd tis done; I am provided Of instruments to fit you: To the King, Ile instantly present you; if I faile, He shal make good your aymes: he's lesse then man, That to atchieve your favour, would not doe Deeds, friends would fear to put their agents to. Exeunt. Enter Virolet Reading. Vir. Quod invitus facis, non est scelus. Tis an axiome, Now whether willingly I have departed With that I lov'd: with that, above her life Lov'd me again, crownd me a happy husband, Was full of children: her afflictions That I begot, that when our age must perish, And all our painted frailties turn to ashes, Then shal they stand and propagate our honors. Whether this done, and taking to protection A new strange beauty, it was a useful one: How to my lust? if it be so, I am sinful; And guilty of that crime I would fling from me. Was there not in it this fair course of vertue? This pious course, to save my friends, my Countrey, That even then had put on a mourning garment, And wept the desolation of her children? Her noblest children? Did not she thrust me on, And to my duty clapt the spur of honour? Was there a way, without this woman, left me To bring 'em off? the marrying of this woman? If not, why am I stung thus? why tormented? Or had there been a wild desire joyn'd with it, How easily, both these, and all their beauties Might I have made mine own? why am I toucht thus, Having perform'd the great redemption, Both of my friends and family? fairly done it? Without base and lascivious ends: O Heaven, Why am I still at war thus? why this a mischiefe, That honesty and honour had propounded, I, and absolv'd my tender wil, and chid me, Nay then unwillingly flung me on. Enter Juliana, and the Boy. Boy. He's here Madam; This is the melancholy walk he lives in, And chooses ever to encrease his sadnesse. Jul. Stand by. Vir. Tis she: how I shake now and tremble? The vertues of that mind are torments to me. Jul. Sir, if my hated face shal stir your anger, Or this forbidden path I tread in vex you; My love, and faire obedience left behind me, Your pardon asked, I shal return and blesse you. Vir. Pray stay a little, I delight to see you; May not we yet, though fortune have divided us, And set an envious stop between our pleasures, Look thus one at another? sigh and weep thus? And read in one anothers eyes, the Legends, And wonders of our old loves? be not fearful, Though you be now a Saint, I may adore you: May I not take this hand, and on it sacrifice The sorrows of my heart? white seale of vertue. Jul. My Lord, you wrong your wedlock. Vir. Were she here, And with her all severe eyes to behold us, We might do this; I might name Julian, And to the reverence of that name, bow thus: I might sigh Juliana, she was mine once; But I too weak a guard for that great Treasure— And whilst she has a name, believe me Lady, This broken heart shal never want a sorrow. Jul. Forget her sir, your honour now commands you You are anothers, keep those griefes for her, She richly can reward 'em. I would have spoken with you Vir. What is your wil? for nothing you can aske, So ful of goodnesse are your words and meanings, Must be denied: speak boldly. Jul. I thank you sir. I come not To beg, or flatter, onely to be believ'd, That I desire: for I shal tell a story, So far from seeming truth, yet a most true one; So horrible in nature, and so horrid; So beyond wickednesse, that when you heare it, It must appeare the practice of another, The cast &amp; malice of some one you have wrongd much; And me, you may imagine me accus'd to, Unlesse you call to mind my daily sufferings; The infinite obedience I have born you, That hates all name and nature of revenge. My love, that nothing but my death can sever, Rather then hers I speak of. Vir. Juliana, To make a doubt of what you shall deliver, After my full experience of your vertues, Were to distrust a providence; to think you can lie, Or being wrong'd, seek after foule repairings, To forge a Creed against my faith. Jul. I must do so, for it concernes your life sir; And if that word may stir you, heare and prosper: I should be dumb else, were not you at stake here. Vir. What new friend have I found, that dares deliver This loden Trunke from his afflictions? What pitying hand, of all that feeles my miseries, Brings such a benefit? Jul. Be wise and manly, And with your honour fall, when Heaven shall call you, Not by a Hellish mischiefe. Vir. Speak my blest one, How weak and poor I am, now she is from me? Jul. Your wife. Viro. How's that? Jul. Your wife. Vir. Be tender of her, I shal believe else— Jul. I must be true: your eare, sir; Fot tis so horrible, if the ayre catch it, Into a thousand plagues, a thousand monsters, It will disperse it selfe, and fright resistance, Viro. She seeke my life with you? make you her agent? Another love? O speake but truth. Jul. Be patient, Deare as I love you, else I leave you wretched. Vir. Forward, tis well, it shal be welcome to me; I have liv'd too long, numbred too many daies, Yet never found the benefit of living; Now when I come to reap it with my service, And hunt for that my youth and honour aimes at, The Sunne sets on my fortune red and bloody, And everlasting night begins to close me. Tis time to die. Enter Martia and Ronvere. Jul. She comes her selfe. Ron. Believe Lady, And on this Angel hand, your servant seales it, You shal be Mistris of your whole desires, And what ye shal command. Mart. Ha mynion, My precious dame, are you there? nay go forward, Make your complaints, and poure out your faind pities, Slave, like to him you serve: I am the same still, And what I purpose, let the world take witnesse, Shal be so finisht, and to such example, Spite of your poore preventions; my deare Gentleman, My honourable man, are you there too? You and your hot desire? Your mercy sir, I had forgot your greatnesse. Jul. Tis not wel Lady. Mart. Lord, how I hate this fellow now; how desperately My stomack stands against him, this base fellow, This gelded foole! Jul. Did you never heare of modesty? Mart. Yes, when I heard of you and so believ'd it, Thou bloodlesse, brainlesse foole. Vir. How? Mart. Thou despis'd foole, Thou onely sign of man, how I contemn thee! Thou woven worthy in a piece of Arras, Fit onely to enjoy a wall; thou beast Beaten to use; Have I preserv'd a beauty, A youth, a love, to have my wishes blasted? My dotings, and the ioyes I came to offer, Must they be lost, and sleighted by a dormouse? Jul. Use more respect; and woman, twill become you; At least, lesse tongue. Mart. Ile use all violence, Let him look for't. Jul. Dare you staine those beauties, Those Heavenly stamps, that raise men up to wonder, With harsh and crooked motions? are you she That overdid all ages, with your honour; And in a little houre dare lose this triumph? Is not this man your husband? Mart. He's my halter; Which (having sued my pardon) I fling off thus, And with him all I brought him, but my anger; Which I wil nourish to the desolation, Not onely of his folly, but his friends, And his whole name. Vir. Tis wel, I have deservd it. And if I were a woman, I would raile too. Mart. Nature nere promis'd thee a thing so Noble. Take back your love, your vow, I give it freely; I poorly scorn it; graze now where you please: That that the dulnesse of thy soule neglected, Kings sue for now. And mark me, Virolet; Thou image of a man, observe my words well. At such a bloody rate Ile sell this beauty, This handsomnesse thou scornst, and flingst away, Thy proud ungrateful life shal shake at: take your house; The petty things you left me give another; And last, take home your trinket: fare you wel, sir. Ron. You have spoke like your selfe; Y'are a brave Lady. Exeunt Ronvere and Martia. Jul. Why do you smile, sir? Vir. O my Juliana, The happinesse this womans scorn has given me, Makes me a man again; proclaimes it selfe, In such a generall joy, through all my miseries, That now methinks— Jul. Looke to your selfe deere sir, And trifle not with danger, that attends you; Be joyfull when y'are free. Vir. Did you not heare her? She gave me back my vow, my love, my freedom; I am free, free as aire; and though to morrow Her bloody wil meet with my life, and sink it, And in her execution teare me peecemeale: Yet have I time once more to meet my wishes, Once more to embrace my best, my noblest, truest; And time that's warranted. Iul. Good sir, forbeare it: Though I confesse, equall with your desires My wishes rise, as covetous of your love, And to as warm alarams spur my wil to: Yet pardon me, the Seal oth' Church dividing us, And hanging like a threatning flame between us; We must not meet, I dare not. Vir. That poore disjoynting That onely strong necessity thrust on you; Not crime, nor studied cause of mine: how sweetly, And nobly I wil bind again and cherish; How I wil recompence one deare imbrace now, One free affection! how I burn to meet it! Looke now upon me. Jul. I behold you willingly, And willingly would yield, but for my credit. The love you first had was preserv'd with honour, The last shal not cry whore; you shal not purchase From me a pleasure, that have equally Lov'd your faire fame as you, at such a rate: Your honesty and vertue must be banquerout, If I had lov'd your lust, and not your lustre; The glorious lustre of your matchlesse goodnesse; I would compel you now to be!—forgive me, Forgive me sir; how fondly stil I love you! Yet Nobly too; make the way straight before me, And let but holy Hymen once more guide me, Under the Ax upon the Rack again, Even in the bed of all afflictions, Where nothing sings our Nuptials but dire sorrows, With all my youth and pleasure Ile imbrace you, Make tyranny and death stand stil affrighted, And at our meeting foules amaze our mischiefes; Til when, high Heaven defend you, and peace guide you. Be wise and manly, make your fate your own, By being master of a providence, That may controle it. Vir. Stay a little with me, My thoughts have chid themselves: may I not kisse you? Upon my truth I am honest. Jul. I believe ye; But yet what that may raise in both our fancies, What issues such warm parents breed. Vir. I obey you, And take my leave as from the Saint that keeps me. I will be right again, and once more happy In thy unimitable love. Jul. Ile pray for ye, And when you fall I have not long to follow. Exeunt. Enter Sesse, Master, Boteswaine, and Gunner, at one doore: Martia and Ronvere, at another. Ses. Now we have got free credit with the Captaine. Mast. Soft, soft, he's here again: Is not that Lady— Or have I lost mine eyes? a salt rhume seizes 'em; But I should know that face. Bots. Make him not madder, Let him forget the woman; steere a lar boord. Mast. He will not kill her. Bots. Any thing he meets; He's like a Hornet now, he hums, and buzzes; Nothing but blood and horror. Mast. I would save the Lady, For such another Lady. Bots. There's the point; And you know there want women of her mettle. Mast. Tis true, they bring such children now, Such demilances, Their fathers socks wil make them Christning clothes. Gun. No more, they view us. Ses. You shal play a while, And sun your selfe in this felicity, You shal you glorious whore; I know you still. But I shal pick an houre when most securely— I say no more. Ron. Do you see those? those are they Shall act your will; come hither my good fellows: You are now the Kings. Are they not goodly fellows? Mart. They have bone enough, if they have stout heart to it. Mast. Still the old wench. Sess. Pray Captaine, let me aske you What Noble Lady's that? tis a rude question, But I desire to know. Ron. She is for the King, sir; Let that suffice for answer. Sess. Is she so sir? In good time may she curse it. Must I breed hackneys for his grace? Ron. What wouldst thou do To merit such a Ladies favour? Sess. Any thing. Ron. That can supply thy wants, and raise thy fortuns? Ses. Let her command, and see what I dare execute. I keep my conscience here; if any man Oppose her wil, and she would have him humbled, Whole families between her and her wishes— Mast. We have seen bleeding throats sir, Cities sackt, And infants stuck upon their Pikes. Botes. Houses a fire, and handsome mothers weeping. Ses. Which we have heaped upon the pile like sacrifices. Churches and Altars, Priests and all devotions, Tumbled together into one rude Chaos. Gun. We know no feare sir, but want of imployment. Sess. Nor other faith but what our purses preach. To gain our ends we can do any thing, And turn our soules into a thousand figures; But when we come to do— Mart. I like these fellowes. Ron. Be ready and waite here within this houre Ile shew you to the King, and he shall like ye: And if you can devise some entertainment To fill his mirth, such as your Countrey uses, Present it, and Ile see it grac'd. After this Comicke Scene we shall imploy you, For one must die. Sess. What is he sir? speak boldly, For we dare boldly do. Ron. This Ladies husband; His name is Virolet. Ses. We shall dispatch it. Exit Martia, Ronvere O damned, damned thing: a base whore first, And then a murtherer; Ile look to you. Bots. Can she be grown so strange? Ses. She has an itch; Ile scratch you my deare daughter, Ile so claw you; Ile curry your hot hide; married and honour'd? And turn those holy blessings into brothels? Your beauty into blood? Ile hunt your hotnesse. Ile hunt you like a traine. Mast. We did all pity her. Ses. Hang her, she is not worth mans memory; She's false and base, and let her fright all stories. Wel, though thou beest mine enemy, Ile right thee, And right thee Nobly. Bots. Faith sir, since she must goe, Let's spare as few as may be. Ses. We'l take all, And like a torrent sweep the slaves before us. You dare endure the worst? Mast. You know our hearts sir, And they shal bleed the last, erst we start from ye. Gun. We can but die, and ere we come to that, We shal pick out some few examples for us. Ses. Then wait the first occasion, and like Curtius, Ile leap the gulph before you, fearlesse leap it: Then follow me like men, and if our vertues May boy our Countrey up, and set her shining In her first state; our fair revenges taken, We have our Noble ends, or else our ashes.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus Scæna prima. Enter Ascanio and Martia above. Mart. As you are Noble, keep me from discovery, And let me onely run a strangers fortune; For when the King shall find I am his daughter He ever holds most ominous, and hates most: With what eyes can he look, how entertain me, But with his feares and cruelties? Asc. I have found you, Suspect not. I am bound to what you like best, What you intend. I dare not be so curious To question now; and what you are, lies hid here. Enter Ferand and Ronvere above. The King comes, make your fortune, I shall joy in't. Ron. All things are ready sir to make you merry, And such a King, you shall behold him now. Fer. I long for't, For I have need of mirth. Ron. The Lady sir. Fer. Now as I am a King, a sprightly beauty, A goodly sweet aspect! my thanks Ronvere, My best thanks; on your lips I seale your wishes, Be what you can; imagine mine, and happy. And now sit downe and smile; come my Ascanio; And let this Monarch enter. Enter Sess. and Mr. Bortsw. Gunner, and Saylors. Rover. These are the Switzers. I told your grace of. Fer. Goodly promising fellowes, With faces to keep fooles in awe, I like 'em; Goe guard the presence well, and doe your duties, To morrow I shall take a further view: Sess. You shall Sir, Or I shall loose my will; how the whore's mounted? How she sits thron'd? thou blasing muddy meteor, That frightest the underworld, with lustfull flashes, How I shall dash thy flames? away, no word more: Ex. Sess. and his company. Florish Cor. Enter Villio, Castruchio, Doctor, and a guard. Fer. Now, here he comes in glory, be merry Masters, meat conveyed away. A Banquet too? Ron. O, he must sit in State Sir! Asca. How rarely he is usher'd? can he thinke now He is a King indeed? Ron. Mark but his countenance. Cast. Let me have pleasures infinite, and to the height, And women in abundance, many women, Enter Ladies. I will disport my grace, Stand there and long for me. What have ye brought me here? is this a Feast Fit for a Prince? a mighty Prince? are these things, These preparations, ha? Doct. May it please your grace? Cast. It does not please my grace: where are the Marchpanes, The Custards double royall, and the subtleties? Why, what weak things are you to serve a Prince thus? Where be the delicates oth' earth and ayre? The hidden secrets of the Sea? am I a Plow-man, You pop me up with porridge? hang the Cooks. Fer. O most Kingly: What a majestique anger. Cast. Give me some wine. Asca. He cooles agen now. Cast. Foole, where are my Players? Let me have all in pomp; let 'em play some love matter, To make the Ladies itch, I'le be with you anon Ladies; You black eyes, I'le be with you Give me some wine I say, And let me have a Masque of Cuckolds enter: Of mine own Cuckolds, And let 'em come in, peeping and rejoycing, Just as I kisse their wives, and somewhat glorying. Some wine I say, then for an excellent night-peece, To shew my glory to my loves, and minions: I will have some great Castle burnt. Vil. Harke you brother: If that be to please these Ladies, tenne to one The fire first takes upon your own, look to that; Then you may shew a night peece. Cast. Where's this wine? Why shall I choak? doe yee long all to be tortur'd? Doct. Here Sir. Cast. Why, what is this? why Doctor, Wine and water Sir. Doct. 'Tis Soveraign for your heat, you must endure it. Vil. Most excellent to coole your nigh-peece Sir. Doct. You are of a high and cholericke complexion, And you must have all ayes. Cast. Shall I have no sheere wine then? Doct. Not for a world: I tender your deare life Sir; And he is no faithfull Subject— Vil. No, by no meanes: Of this you may drinke; and never hang, nor quarter, Nor never whip the fool, this liquors mercifull. Cast. I will sit down and eat then: Kings when th'are hungry, May eat I hope. Doct. Yes, but they eat discreetly. Cast. Come, taste this dish, and cut me liberally; I like sauce well. Doct. Fie 'tis too hot Sir: Too deeply season'd with the spice, away with 't, You must acquaint your stomack with those diets Are temperately nourishing. Cast. But pray stay Doctor, And let me have my meat agen. Doct. By no meanes: I have a charge concerns my life. Cast. No meat neither; Doe Kings never eat Doctor? Doct. Very little Sir. And that too very choice. Vil. Your King never sleeps Brother, He must not sleep, his cares still keep him waking. Now he that eats and drinkes much, is a dormouse; The third part of a wafer, is a weeks diet. Cast. Appoint me something then. Doct. There. Cast. This I feel good, But it melts too suddainly; yet, how, that gone too! Ye are not mad! I charge you: take away. Doct. For your health Sir, A little quickens nature, much depresses. Cast. Eat nothing for my health? that's a new dyet; Let me have something, something has some savour. Why thou uncourteous Doctor, shall I hang thee? Doct. 'Tis better Sir, then I should let you surfet; My death were nothing. Vil. To loose a King, were terrible. Cast. Nay, then I'le carve my self, I'le stay no ceremonies. This is a Partridge Pye, I am sure that's nourishing, Or Galen is an Asse: 'tis rarely season'd: Ha Doctor have I hit right? a mark, a mark there? Vil. What ailes thy grace? Cast. Retrive those Partridges. Or as I am a King— Doct. Pray Sir be patient, They are flowen too farre. Vil. These are breath'd pyes an't please you, And your hawkes are such Buzzards. Cast. A King and have nothing, Nor can have nothing! Uil. What think you of pudding? A pudding Royall? Cast. To be royally starv'd, Whip me this foole to death; he is a blockhead. Vil. Let 'em think they whip me, as we think you a King: 'T will be enough. Cast. As for you dainty Doctor, the Table taken away, All gone, all snatch'd away, and I unsatsfied, Without my wits being a King and hungry? Suffer but this thy treason? I tell thee Doctor, I tell it thee, in earnest, and in anger, I am damnably hungry, my very grace is hungry. Vil. A hungry grace is fittest to no meale Sir. Doct. Some two houres hence, you shall see more: but still Sir, You must retaine a strict and excellent dyet. Vil. It sharpens you, and makes your wit so poynant, Your very words will kill. Doct. A bit of Marmalade No bigger then a Pease. Vil. And that well butter'd, The ayre thrice purified, and three times spirited, Becomes a King: your rare conserve of nothing Breeds no offence. Cast. Am I turn'd King Camelion, And keep my Court ith' ayr? Fer. They vex him cruelly. Asca. In two dayes more they'l starve him. Fer. Now the women, there's no food left but they. Asca. They'l prove small nourishment. Yet h'as another stomack and a great one, I see by his eye. Cast. I'le have mine own power here; Mine own Authority; I need no tutor. Doctor this is no dyet. Doct. It may be Sir Vil. Birlady, it may turne to a dry dyet; And how thy grace, will ward that— Cast. Stand off Doctor; And talke to those that want faith, Fer. Hot and mighty. Asca. He will coole apace, no doubt. Cast. Faire, plump, and red, A forehead high; an eye revives the dead; A lip like ripest fruit, inviting still. Vil. But O, the rushy well, below the hill, Take heed of that, for though it never faile Take heed I say, for thereby hangs a taile. Cast. I'le get ye all with Childe. Vil. With one Childe Brother, So many men in a Blew Coat. Cast. Had I fed well. And drunk good store of wine, ye had been blest all, Blest all with double Births; come kisse me greedily, And think no more upon your foolish Husbands, They are transitory things: a Kings fame meets you, Doct. Vanish away. Ex. Women. Cast. How, they gone too? my guard there: Take me this devill Doctor, and that foole there, And sow 'em in a sack; bring back the women, The lovely women, drown these rogues or hang 'em. Asca. He is in earnest Sir. Fer. In serious earnest, Enter Sess. Master, Boatsw. Gunner and Saylors. I must needs take him off. Sess. Now, now be free. Now liberty, now Country-men, shake from ye The Tyrants yoake. All Liberty, liberty, liberty. Guard. Treason, treason, treason. Fer. We are betrayed, fly to the town, cry treason, And raise our faithfull friends; O my Ascanio. Asca. Make haste, we have way enough. Guard. Treason, treason. Ex. Fer. Asca. and guard. Sess. Spare none, put all to th'sword: a vengeance shake thee; Art thou turn'd King againe? Cast. I am a rascall: Spare me but this time, if ever I see King more, Or once beleeve in King. Sess. The ports are ours. The treasure and the port, fight bravely Gentlemen; Cry to the Town, cry liberty and honour; Waken their persecuted soules, cry loudly, One of crying Liberty and freedome. We'l share the wealth among ye. Cast. Doe you heare Captaine? If ever you heare me, name a King. Sess. You shall not. Cast. Or though I live under one, obey him. Gun. This rogue againe. Sess. Away with him good Gunner. Cast. Why look ye Sir? I'le put you to no charg; I'le never eat. Gun. I'le take a course, you shall not Come, no more words. Enter Boatsw. Cast. Say nothing when you kill me. Sess. He's taken to the Towers strength; Now stand sure Gentlemen. We have him in a pen, he cannot scape us, The rest oth' Castle's ours; liberty, liberty: What is this City up? Boatsw. They are up and glorious, And rouling like a storm they come; their Tents Ring nothing but liberty and freedome. The women are in Arms too. Sess. Let 'em come all. Honour and liberty. All. Honour and liberty. Exeunt. Enter Iuliana. Jul. This womans threats, her eyes, even red with fury Which like prodigious meteors, foretold Assur'd destruction, are still before me. Besides I know such natures unacquainted With any meane, or in their love, or hatred, And she that dar'd all dangers to possesse him, Will check at nothing, to revenge the losse Of what she held so deare, I first discover'd Her bloody purposes, which she made good, And openly profess'd 'em; that in me Was but a cold affection; charity Commands so much to all; for Virolet Me thinks I should forget my Sexes weaknesse, Rise up, and dare beyond a womans strength; Then doe, not counsell: he is too secure, And in my judgement, 'twere a greater service To free him from a deadly Enemy, Then to get him a friend. I undertooke too, To crosse her plots, oppos'd my piety, Against her malice; and shall vertue suffer? No Martia, wer't thou here equally armed, I have a cause, spite of thy masculine breeding, That would assure the victory: my angell Direct and help me. Enter Virolet, like Ronvere. Vir. The State in Combustion, Part of the Cittadell forc'd, the treasure seiz'd on; The guards corrupted, arme themselves against Their late protected Master; Ferrant fled too, And with small strength, into the Castles Tower, The onely Aventine, that now is left him? And yet the undertakers, nay, performers, Of such a brave and glorious enterprize, Are yet unknown: they did proceed like men, I like a childe; and had I never trusted So deep a practise unto shallow foole, Besides my soules peace, in my Iuliana, The honour of this action had been mine, In which, accurs'd, I now can claime no share. Iul. Ronvere! 'tis he, a thing, next to the devill I most detest, and like him terrible; Martia's right hand, the Instrument I feare too, That is to put her bloody will into act. Have I not will enough, and cause too mighty? Weake womens fear, fly from me. Vir. Sure this habit, This likenesse to Ronvere which I have studied, Either admits me safe to my designe, Which I too cowardly have halted after, And suffer'd to be ravish't from my glory; Or sincks me and my miseries together; Either concludes me happy. Iul. He stands musing, Some mischiefe is now hatching: In the full meditation, of his wicknesse, I'le sink his cursed soule: guid my hand heaven, And to my tender arm give strength and fortun, That I may doe a pious deed all ages Shall blesse my name for; all remembrance Crown she. Uir. It shall be so. Jul. It shall not, take that token, And beare it the lustfull Arms of Martia, Tell her, for Uirolets deare sake, I sent it. Uir. O I am happy, let me see thee, That I may blesse the hand that gave me liberty, O courteous hand, nay, thou hast done most nobly, And heaven has guided thee, 'twas their great justice; O blessed wound, that I could come to kisse thee! How beautifull, and sweet thou shewest! Jul. Oh! Vir. Sighe not, Nor weep not Deare, shed not those soveraign Balsoms Into my blood; which must recover me; Then I shall live again, to doe a mischiefe, Against the mightinesse of love and vertue, Some base unhallowed hand shall rob thy right off. Help me, I faint: so. Iul. O unhappy wench! How has my zeale abus'd me? you that guard vertue, Were ye asleep? or doe you laugh at innocence? You suffer'd this mistake? O my deare Virolet! An everlasting curse follow that forme I strook thee in his name ever blasted: For his accursed shadow has betrayed The sweetnesse of all youth, the noblenesse, The honour, and the valor; wither'd for ever The beauty and the bravery of all mankind: O my dull, devils eyes. Uir. I doe forgive you, By this, and this I doe; I know you were cozend; The shadow of Ronvere, I know you aym'd at, And not at me; but 'twas most necessary, I should be struk, some hand above directed you, For Juliana could not shew her justice Without depriving high heaven of his glory, Or any subject fit for her, but Virolet; Forgive me too, and take my last breath sweet one, This the new marriage of our soules together; Thinke of me Iuliana, but not often, For feare my faults should burthen your affections, Pray for me, for I faint. Vir. O stay a little, A little little Sir. Iul. Fye Iuliana. Iul. Shall I outlive the vertue, I have murderd? Vir. Hold, or thou hatest my peace: give me the dagger; On your obedience, and your love, deliver it. If you doe thus, we shall not meet in heaven sweet; No guilty blood comes there; kill your intentions, And then you conquer: there where I am going, Would you not meet me Deare? Jul. Yes. Vir. And still love me? Iul. And still behold you. Vir. Live then till heaven cals you, Then ripe and full of sweetnesse you rise Sainted. Then I that went before you to prepare, Shall meet and welcome you, and daily court you With Hymnes of holy Love—I goe out, Give me your hand, farewell, in peace farewell, Remember me, farewell. dyes. Iul. Sleep you sweet glasses, An everlasting slumber Crown those Christals, All my delight adue, farewell, Deare Virolet, Deare, Deare, most Deare; O I can weep no more, My body now is fire, and all consuming, Here will I sit, forget the world, and all things, And onely waite what heaven shall turne me to, For now me thinkes, I should not live, She sits down. Enter Pandulfo. Pand. O my sweet daughter, The worke is finisht now, I promis'd thee: Here are thy vertues shewed, here register'd, And here shall live for ever. Iul. Blot it, burne it, I have no vertue, hatefull I am as hell is. Pand. Is not this Uirolet? Vir. Aske no more questions, Mistaking him, I kil'd him. Pand. O my Sonne, Nature turnes to my heart again, my deare Sonne, Sonne of my age, would'st thou goe out so quickly? So poorly take thy leave, and never see me? Was this a kind stroake daughter? could you love him? Honour his Father, and so deadly strike him? O wither'd timelesse youth, are all thy promises, Thy goodly growth of Honors come to this? Doe I halt still ith' world, and trouble nature, When her maine pieces founder, and faile daily? Enter Boy, and three Servants. Boy he does weep certain: what bodies that lies by him? How doe you Sir? Pand. O look there Lucio, Thy Master, thy best Master. Boy. Woe is me. They have kill'd him, slaine him basely, O my Master, Pand. Well daughter well; what heart you had to do this; I know he did you wrong; but 'twas his fortune, And not his fault, for my sake that have lov'd you, But I see now, you scorne me too. Boy. O Mistrisse? Can you sit there, and his cold body breathlesse? Basely upon the earth? Pand. Let her alone Boy, She glories in his end. Boy. You shall not fit here, And suffer him you loved—ha; good Sir come hither, Come hither quickly, heave her up; O heaven Sir, O God, my heart, she's cold; cold and stiffe too. Siffe as a stake, she's dead. Pand. She's gone, nere bend her, I know her heart, she could not want his company: Blessing goe with thy soule, sweet Angels shadow it O, that I were the third now, what a happinesse? But I must live, to see you layed in earth both, Then build a Chapell to your memories, Where all my wealth shall fashion out your storyes. Then digge a little grave besides, and all's done. How sweet she looks, her eyes are open smiling, I thought she had been alive; you are my charge Sir, And amongst you, I'le see his goods distributed. Take up the bodies, mourn in heart my friends, Yon have lost two Noble succors; follow me, And thou sad Country, weepe this misery. Exeunt. Enter Sess. Boitswaine, Master, Gunner, Citizens, and Souldiers, as many as may be. Sess. Keep the Ports strongly mand, and let none enter, But such as are known Patriots. All. Liberty, liberty. Sess. 'Tis a substantiall thing, and not a word You men of Naples, which if once taken from us, All other blessings leave us; 'tis a Jewell Worth purchasing, at the dear rate of life, And so to be defended. O remember What you have suffer'd, since you parted with it; And if again you wish not to be slaves, And properties to Ferrands pride and lust, Take noble courage, and make perfect what Is happily begun. 1. Cit. Our great preserver, You have infranchis'd us, from wretched bondage. 2. Cit. And might be known, to whom we owe our freedome, We to the death would follow him. 3. Cit. Make him King, The Tyrant once remov'd. Sess. That's not my end. 'Twas not ambition that brought me hither, With these my faithfull friends, nor hope of spoile; For when we did possesse the Tyrants treasure, By force extorted from you, and employed To load you with most miserable thraldome, We did not make it ours, but with it purchas'd The help of these, to get you liberty, That for the same price kept you in subjection. Nor are we Switzers, worthy Country-men, But Neapolitans; now eye me well: And tho the reverend Emblems of mine age, My Silver locks are shorne, my beard cut off, Partaking yet of an adulterate Colour; Tho 14. yeares you have not seen this face, You may remember it, and call to mind, There was a Duke of Sess, A much wrong'd Prince, Wrong'd by this Tyrant Ferrand. 1. Cit. Now I know him. 2. Cit. 'Tis he, long live the Duke of Sess. Sess. I thank you. The injuries I receiv'd, I must confesse, Made me forget the love I owed this Country, For which I hope, I have given satisfaction, In being the first that stir'd, to give it freedome; And with your loves and furtherance, will call back, Long banisht peace, and plenty, to this people; 2. Cit. Lead where you please, we'l follow. 1. Cit. Dare all dangers. Enter Pandulf, the Bodies of Uirolet, and Iuliana, upon a Hearse. Ses. What solemne funeral's this? Pand. There rest a while, And if't be possible there can be added Wings to your swift desire of just revenge, Hear, (if my teares will give way to my words) In briefe a most sad story. Ses. Speake, what are they? I know thee well Pandulfo. Pand. My best Lord? As farre as sorrow will give leave, most welcome; This Virolet was, and but a Sonne of mine, I might say, the most hopefull of our Gentry; And though unfortunate, never Ignoble: But I'le speake him no further. Look on this, This face, that in a Savage would move pitty, The wonder of her Sex; and having said 'Tis Iuliana, Eloquence will want words To set out her deservings; this blest Lady That did indure the Rack, to save her Husband, That Husband, who, in being forc'd to leave her, Indur'd a thousand tortures; By what practise, I know not, (bur 'twas sure a cunning one) Are made, the last I hope, but sad examples Of Ferrands Tyranny. Convey the bodies hence. Ses. Expresse your sorrow In your revenge, not teares, my worthy Souldiers: That fertile earth, that teem'd so many children, To feed his cruelty, in her wounded wombe, Can hardly now receive 'em. Boatsw. We are cold, Cold walls shall not keep him from us. Gun. Were he cover'd with mountaines, and roome onely for a Bullet to be sent levell at him, I would speed him. Mr. Let's scale this petty Towre; at Sea we are Falcons, And fly unto the maine top in a moment. What then can stop us here? 1 Cit. We'l teare him peece-meale. 2 Cit. Or eat a passage to him. Ses. Let discretion Direct your anger; that's a victory, Which is got with least losse, let us make ours such: And therefore friends, while we hold parly here, Raise your scalado, on the other side, But enter'd weake, your suffrings. Ex. Saylors and Souldiers. 1 Cit. In our wrongs. There was no meane. 2 Cit. Nor in our full revenge Will we know any. Sess. Be appeas'd good man, No sorrow can redeem them from deaths Prison; What his inevitable hand hath seiz'd on, The world cannot recover. All the comfort That I can give to you, is to see vengeance Pour'd dreadfully upon the Authors head, Of which their ashes may be sensible, That have falne by him. sound a parly. Enter Ferrand, Martia, Ascanio, and Ronvere, above. Pand. They appeare. Fer. 'Tis not that we esteme rebellious Traytors Worthy an answer to their proudest Sommons That we vouchsafe our presence; or to exchange One syllable with 'em: but to let such know, Though Circled round with treason, all points bent As to their Center at my heart, 'tis free, Free from feare villaines, and in this weake Tower Ferrand commands as absolute, as when He trod upon your necks, and as much scornes you. And when the Sunne of Majesty shall breake through The clouds of your rebellion, every beame Instead of comfortable heate, shall send Consuming plagues among you; and you call That government which you term'd tyrannous Hereafter, gentle. Ses. Flatter not thy selfe With these deluding hopes, thou cruell beast, Thou art ith' toyle, and the glad Huntsman prouder, By whom thou art taken, of his prey, then if (Like thee) he should command, and spoile his Forrest. Fer. What art thou? Ses. To thy horror, Duke of Sesse. Fer. The Divel. Sess. Reserv'd for thy damnation. Fer. Why shakes my love? Mart. O I am lost for ever; Mountains divide me from him; some kind hand Prevent our fearfull meeting: Or lead me. To the steep rock, whose rugged brows are bent Upon the swelling main; there let me hide me: And as our bodies then shall be divided, May our soules never meet. Fer. Whence grows this, Sweetest? Mar. There are a thousand furies in his looks; And in his deadly silence more loud horror, Then when in Hell the tortur'd and tormentors Contend whose shreeks are greater. Wretched me! It is my father. Ses. Yes, and I wil own her, Sir, Till my revenge. It is my daughter, Ferrand; My daughter, thou hast whor'd. Fer. I triumph in it: To know she's thine, affords me more true pleasure, Then the act gave me, When even at the height, I crack'd her Virgin zone. Her shame dwell on thee, And all thy family; may they never know A female issue, but a whore, Ascanio. Ronvere, look cheerfully; be thou a man too, And learn of me to die. That we might fall, And in our ruines swallow up this Kingdom, Nay the whol world, and make a second Chaos. And if from thence a new beginning rise, Be it recorded this did end with us; And from our dust hath embryon. Ron. I liv'd with you, And wil die with you; your example makes me Equally bold. Asc. And I resolv'd to beare What ere my fate appoints me. Ses. They are ours, Now to the spoyle. Bots. Pity the Lady; to all else be deaft. Exeunt. Within, Kill, kill, kill. Alarum, Flo. Trumpets. Retreat. Enter Sesse with Ferrands head, the Citizens, Master, Boteswain, Gunner, Souldiers, bringing in Ascanio and Martia. Ses. Cruell beginnings meet with cruell ends; And the best sacrifice to Heaven for peace, Is tyrants blood: and those that stuck fast to him, Flesh'd instruments in his commands to mischiefe, With him dispatch'd. Bots. They are all cut off. Ses. Tis well. All. Thanks to the Duke of Sesse. Ses. Pay that to Heaven, And for a generall joy, give generall thanks: For blessings nere descend from Heaven, but when A gratefull Sacrifice ascends from men. To your devotion; leave me; there's a Scene, Which I would act alone; yet you may stay, For wanting just spectators, twill be nothing. The rest forbeare me. Citizens. Liberty liberty, liberty. Mar. I would I were as far beneath the Centre, As now I stand above it; how I tremble! Thrice happy they that dyed; I dying live To stand the whirlwind of a fathers fury. Now it moves toward me. Ses. Thou, I want a name, By which to stile thee: All articulate sounds That do expresse the mischiefe of vile woman, That are, or have been, or shall be, are weak To speak thee to the height. Witch, parricide, For thou, in taking leave of modesty, Hast kild thy father, and his honour lost; He's but a walking shadow, to torment thee. To leave, and rob thy father; then set free His foes, whose slavery he did prefer Above all treasure, was a strong defeazance To cut off, even the surest bonds of mercy. After all this, having given up thy selfe, Like to a sensuall beast, a slave to lust, To play the whore, and then (high Heaven it racks me) To finde out none to quench thy appetite, But the most cruell King, whom next to Hell, Thy father hated; and whose black imbraces Thou shouldst have fled from, as the whips of furies; What canst thou look for? Enter Pandulph, and bodies borne on the Herse. Mart. Death; and tis not in you To hurt me further: my old resolution, Take now the place of feare; in this I liv'd, In this Ile die, your daughter. Pand. Look but here; You had, I know, a guilty hand in this; Repent it Lady. Mart. Juliana dead? And Virolet? Pand. by her unwilling hand. Mart. Fates you are equall. What can now fall on me, That I wil shrink at? now unmov'd I dare Look on your anger, and not bend a knee To aske your pardon: let your rage run higher Then billows rais'd up by a violent Tempest, And be as that is, deafe to all intreaties: They are dead, and I prepar'd; for in their fall All my desires are sum'd up. Ses. Impudent too? Die in it wretch. Bots. Stay sir. Botsw. kils her. Ses. How dar'st thou villaine, Snatch from my sword the honour of my justice? Bots. I never did you better service sir, Yet have been ever faithfull. I confesse That she deserv'd to die; but by whose hand? Not by a fathers. Double all her guilt, It could not make you innocent, had you done it. In me tis murder, in you twere a crime Heaven could not pardon. Witnesse that I love you, And in that love I did it. Ses.
