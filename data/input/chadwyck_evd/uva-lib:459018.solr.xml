      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. ScÅn. I. Enter Horatio, Lodovico. Hor. The clouds of Doubts and Fears are now dispers'd, And Joy, like the resplendent Sun, spreads forth New life and spirit over all this Kingdom, That lately gasp'd with Sorrow. Lod. Now the Court Puts on her rich Attire, and like fresh Flora, After the blasts of winter, spreads her Mantle, Deck'd with delightful Colours, to receive The jocund Spring, that brings her this new life. ScÅn. II. Enter Flavello bare before the Prince, the Queen Eulalia, Alinda, Attendants, Hoboys, Hor. The Queen comes on, Joy in that face appears That lately was overwhelmed in her tears, Lod. and Hor. Health and perpetual Joy unto the Queen, Eul. Thanks my good Lords, I am prepar'd to meet it. How neer's the King? Hor. At hand, my Soveraign. Eul. Welcome that happy word that leads the way, But yet he is not come, he is not here: Never so sweet an expectation Appear'd so tedious: pray set on apace, That I may live yet to an interview With my lov'd honour'd Lord. Hor. That your delay May seem less grievous hear this by the way, A brief relation of the Kings success In this his late well-won Battail. Eul. Be it so. But mention not his dangers, good my Lord. Hor. That were to make his Conquest nothing worth: It would make Victory upon his head, As she had flown into his Burgonet, To shrowd her from a storm, and not to sit Or rather stand triumphant on a foot, With display'd wings upon the utmost Sprigg Of his high stourishing Plume, vaunting her safety So perch'd and so supported by his Valour. Prin. Pray Mother hear the dangers too; the worst Will make the best the sweeter: I could hear Of dangers yet to come; and Women may Discourse of Perils past each Holy-day. Hor. Well said, young Prince, right of the Kings own Metal: And gracious Madam, let me tell you, though You do not love to hear of blood and danger, Y' have brought a Warrior forth, I do foresee't: I love to speak my thoughts, I hope you trust me, A right old Courtier I, still true to th' Crown. Prin. How this old fellow talkes! you said, my Lord, You would discourse the Battail. Ho. Excellent Prince, I was i'th' way: but the Queen put me out on't. Eul. Well, well my Lord, deliver't your own way. Hor. Then, humph, humh, humh, in my own way. But by the way, no way to derogate From the Kings matchless resolution. A word or two of the best Soldier In all the world (under the King I mean, I know my limits) that's our brave General, Lord Sforza, Madam, your stout Country-man, Though our Kings Subject now; that bore him so At the great marriage-Triumph in Tourneament, Tumbling down Peers and Princes, that e'er since, He's cal'd your Champion, and the Queens old Souldier. Eul. But what of him now in the battail? Hor. Marry but this, That as we have a King, And as the King brings victory, nay life, Home to his Queen, his Country and our comforts, Next under Heaven we are to give the praise To this old Souldier, to this man, the man Indeed, another man is not to be (Except the King) nam'd in this Victory. Eul. You seem my Lord to honour Sforza yet Before the King. Hor. Excuse me gracious Madam, I know my limits: what? before the King? I am an old Courtier I, still true to th' Crown, But thus it is declar'd, that in the battail, When in the heat of fight the mingled bloods Of either Army reek'd up to the Sun, Dimming its glorious light with gory vapour, When slaughter had rang'd round about the field, Searching how by advantage to lay hold upon our King. Eul. Prithee no more. Prin. Good mother. Hor. At last she spied and circled him about With Spears and swords so thickly pointed on him, That nothing but his sacred valour could Give light for a supply to his relief, Which shin'd so through and through his wals of foes, As a rich Diamond 'mongst an heap of Ruines, And so was found by the quick eye of Sforza, When like a Deitie arm'd with wrath and Thunder, He cut a path of horror through the Battail Raining down blood about him as he flew, Like a prodigious Cloud of pitch and fire, Until he pierc'd into the straight, wherein The Royal Person of our King was at His last bare stake of one life to a thousand. Eul. I dare not hear it, yet. Hor. Then in a word, old Sforza fetcht him off, And with his sword which never touch'd in vain, Set him i'th' heart of 's Army once again. Eul. That I like well. Hor. That did your Champion, Madam, The Queens old Souldier, and your Father, Lady: D'ye simple at it? such a Souldier breaths not, Only the King except: now note the Miracle, The King receiv'd and gave new life at once Of and unto his Army, which new life Was straight way multipli'd, as if the lives Of all the slain on both sides were transfus'd In our remaining part, who with a present fury Made on with that advantage on the Foe, That the whole field was won as at one blow. I am prevented. [Shout within, Victory] ScÅn. III. Enter Captain, Drum and Colours, King and Sforza, Souldiers. The King embraces and kisses the Queen, the Prince and Alinda. King. Now cease our Drums, and furle our Ensignes up: Dismiss the Souldiers, hostile Armes surcease, Whiles we rejoyce, safe in these Armes of Peace. Sfor. Go Souldiers, better never stood the shock Of danger, or made good their Countreys cause. Drink this to the Kings health and victory. Sold. Heaven bless the King, and our good General Sforza. Again. Long live the King and Sforza, Sforza and the King, Kin. The King and Sforza, Sforza and the King, Equal at least, and sometimes three notes higher, Exit Capt. and Sould. Sound Sforza's name then doth the Kings: the voyce Of the wild People as I pass'd along Threw up his praises neerer unto Heaven Ever methought then mine: but be it so, He has deserv'd well, now let me again Embrace the happie comforts of my life. Through deadly dangers, yea through death it self, I am restor'd unto my Heaven on Earth, My wife and Son: a thousand blessings on thee. Say, dearest life, whose prayers I know have been Successful to me in this doubtful War, How welcome am I? Eul. That's more than I can speak: For should I bring comparisons of the Spring, After a Frosty winter to the Birds, Or rich returns of ventures to the Merchant, After the twentieth currant news of Shipwrack, Redemption from captivity, or the Joyes Women conceive after most painful Childbirths, All were but Fabulous nothings to the Bliss Your presence brings in answer to my Prayers: Heaven heard me at the full: when I forget To send due praises thither, let me die Most wretched, though my gratitude shall never Sleep to th' inferior means, e'en to the meanest Souldier assistant to your safe return, Especially to you good Sforza, Noble Souldier, I heard of your fidelitie. Sfor. My duty Madam. King. Are you one of his great Admirers too? The world will make an Idol of his Valour, While I am but his shadow: Ile but think on't, Indeed he's worth your favour, he has done wonders. Sfor. Let me now speak, I may not hear these wonders bounc'd, King. You do forget your self. Eul. What says my Lord? King. Nay I have done. Gonzago, you and I have chang'd no words yet; I have brought Victory home, which may perhaps Be checkt at when my heat shall fall to ashes. How will you maintain your Fathers quarrels ore his Grave? Prin. I do not hope t' outlive you Sir, but if I must, I sure shall hope to keep your name and right Alive whilst I live, though I cannot hope To have so good a Souldier at my Standard As Warlike Sforza. King. This is more and worse Then all the rest: the childe has spoken plainly, I had been nothing without Warlike Sforza: Ile make him nothing, and no longer stand His Cypher that in number makes him ten. My Lords, my thanks to you for your due care In my late absence. Hor. All was Loyal Dutie, As we are old Courtiers Sir, still true to th' Crown. King. I have found you faithful. Hor. It befits true Statesmen Watchful to be at home 'gainst civil harms, When Kings expose themselves to hostile Arms. King. There's a State-Rime now: but Horatio, Has not Petruccio visited the Court Since our departure? Hor. Pox on Petruccio. Bless me, and be good to me: how thinks your Grace of my Allegiance, and can ask Me that Question? King. Now he is in his Fit. Hor. The Hangman take him. Petruccio King? Peugh, peugh; I hate to name him. How can you think your State had been secur'd If he had breath'd amongst us? That vile wretch, Whom in your Kingly wisdom you did banish The Court for a most dangerous Male-content, After his just repulse from being your General, When he durst stand in Competition VVith brave deserving Sforza here, the best Most absolute Souldier of the world. King. Still Sforza! Hor. Except your Majesty. King. There is an Exception wrung out, Hor. He come at Court by my permission? I should as soon be won to set your Court On fire, as see him here. King. Send for him speedily. Hor. [Starts] Your Majesty is pleas'd to have it so. King. And upon your Allegiance Which you so boast of, let me have him here, And very speedily; Ile have your head else. Hor. Nay since it is your Highness pleasure, and So seriously commanded, I will send My own head off my shoulders, but wee'l have him: In what you can command, I dare be Loyal. King. Look to it, [goes to the Queen] Hor. It must be so, this is one of his un-to-be-examin'd hastie Humours, one of his starts: these and a devillish gift He has in Venerie, are all his faults. Well, I must go, and still be true to th' Crown. Exit Horatio. Lod. Petruccio sent for! who for braving of Brave Sforza here, so lately was confin'd. Flav. I cannot think the Court must hold 'm both At once, less they were reconcil'd, which is As much unlikely: what do you think my Lord? Lod. I know not what to think. King. She Sforza's Daughter, say you? Queen. Yes my Lord. King. She's a right handsome one: I never knew he had a Daughter. Eul. He brought her o'er a Childe with me, when happily I came your Bride, bred her at home, she never saw the Court, till now I sent for her to be some comfort in your long absence. King. Sforza's absence, I fear you mean. [aside] Eul. And trust me Sir, Her simple Countrey Innocence at first Bred such delight in me, with such affection, That I have call'd her Daughter, to embolden her. King. O did you so? Eul. And now she has got some spirit, A prettie lively spirit, which becomes her Methinks so like her Fathers. King. Very good. I like her strangely. Eul. What was that she said To you Gonzago? Gonz. That Heaven might ha' pleased T' have fashion'd her out to have been a Queen. King. Comely Ambition. Sfor. Reconcile all quickly, Or you had better never have been born, Then disobey my last command, which was Never to see the Court till I induc'd you. Do you stare at me? Alin. I but obey'd the Queen. I hope shee'l answer't. Sfor. No more, Ile talk with you anon. King. Come Sforza, Welcome to Court, so is your Daughter too, I have tane notice of her: O fairest, welcome. Kisses her. Sforza storms. Come you both with me this night, weel Feast: Pray bid us welcome all, as but one Guest. Eul. I shall in all obey you. Alin. And for this, Less then a King I shall abhor to kiss. Exeunt. ScÅn. IV. Enter Petruccio. Petr. Repuls'd? disgrac'd? and made the scorn o'th' Court? In the advancement of an upstart stranger, Because he is the Queens dear Countrey-man? Have I for all my many Services, Found the reward of being made an outcast? Could not the King be pleas'd, though he advanc'd Sforza unto the Honour I deserv'd, To trust me in his service? could he think My sword could be an hinderance in the Battail, Or have delay'd the winning of the Field! And must his Court and presence which I have VVith my observance dignifi'd, reject me Now, as a dangerous and infectious person! Tis a new way to gratifie old Souldiers. So soon return'd? I do commend thy speed. The news at Court. Enter Servant in haste: switch. Serv. The King's come bravely home, And every ear is fill'd with Victory, But chiefly with the Fame of Sforza's Valour. Petr. Sforza? Ser. Lord Sforza Sir, I cry him mercy, The new Lord General. Petr. Thou com'st too fast [strikes him] Serv. So me thinks too, less 'twere to better purpose. Petr. The Fame of Sforza's Valour, good if it last. VVhat other news? Serv. I have told you all the best. Petr. If thou hast worse, let's have it quickly. Serv. You shall, That you may flie the danger. Petr. VVhat is't, without your Preface? Serv. Here are Messengers sent from the King to you; pray Heaven all be well. Ther's the old tutchie testie Lord, that rails, and never could abide you, since the King look'd from your Honour. Petr. Th' hast made me amends, ther's for thy news. Is this bad news? Serv. Truely my Lord, I think so: For if the King had sent to you for good, I think he would have sent one lov'd you better. Petr. VVhat? then the old Courtier? thou knowst him not. Ile shew him thee. He is the onely man That does the King that service, just to love Or hate as the King does, so much and so long, Just to a scruple or a minute, and then he has an ignorant Loyaltie, to do as the King bids him, though he fear immediate death by it. Call him in. Serv. They come. ScÅn. V. Enter Horatio and guard. Hor. My masters, come along, and close up to me: my Loyaltie defend me, I shall not dare to trust me in this devillish fellows reach else. And thus it is Sir. Petr. 'Tis thus Sir, I can tell you. [drawes] Hor. Good friends look well to me. Petr. You come with strength of armed men, to bear me From mine own House which was my appointed Prison, Unto a stronger Hold. Hor. Look every way. Petr. The King it seems now that his Mignion General is Landed, cannot think him safe, and I not Faster: which though I can prevent, I will not. Come, what Gaol will you remove me to? Hor. I would thou wert in Hell for me: No Sir, I come to call you to the King. Petr. What? with a Guard? Hor. That's for my Self. I know thou lovest not me. Petr. Nor you me, do you? Hor. Nor cannot, less the King could love thee. Petr. Why perhaps he does, you see he sends for me. Hor. Why if he does, I do, but 'tis more then I know, or can collect yet by his Majesties affection. Petr. Here's an Humour now. Hor. I know my Loyalty, and I know the King has sent for you; But to what end I know not: and if it be to hang thee I cannot help it. Look to me now my masters. Nor do I care, that's the plain troth on't, while the King is pleas'd, and thou wert my Brother. I am an old Courtier I, still true to the Crown. Petr. I commend your Loyaltie: Come, we are Friends. Hor. Look to me for all that. Petr. Were you afraid, you came so arm'd and guarded? Hor. That's because I would not be afraid: look to me still. Petr. Indeed my Lord you are welcome. Hor. Yes, as much as I look for. Petr. VVhat should the King intend by this? I fear no ill, For I have done none; therefore I may go. Perhaps he thinks to make me honour Sforza Now in his time of Jollitie, and be friends: I need not go for that; he cannot do't, Yet I will go to tell him so: my Lord, My joy to see the King will post me faster Than your grave Loyaltie, or Massie Bill-men. Hor. Yes, prethie keep afore with thy back towards me, and so long I dare trust thee. Have an eye though. Exeunt Omnes. ScÅn. VI. Enter King and Flavello. King. Her Father hath surpriz'd her then? Flav. Yes, and means to hurry her away from Court this night: I heard him threaten it. King. But he must not do't, she is too sweet Flavello, and too fit for my embraces, to be snatch'd away. Flav. Now that shee's ripe and ready for your use, Like fruit that cryes, Come eat me. Ile not boast The pains I took to fit her to your Appetite, before she saw you. King. How, my carefull Agent? Flav. At first sight of her Feature, I foresaw She was compliable to your affection. Then by discourse I found she was ambitious, I ply'd her then with Pills that puff'd her up To an high longing, till she saw the hopes She had to grow by. Pray stand close, they come. Enter Sforza and Alinda. Sfor. Has the air of Court infected you already? Has the Kings kisses mov'd by adulterate heat, Swoln you into a stubborn loathsomness Of wholsom Counsel? Come your wayes; Ile try If Countrey-Air and Diet can restore you To your forgotten modestie and Duty. Alin. VVhat have I done amiss? Sfor. Do you capitulate? But so much satisfaction as may make Thee sensible of shame, I will afford thee: Didst thou not after Banquet, when the King Heated with wine, and lust rais'd in his eyes, Had kiss'd thee once, twice, thrice, though I look'd on, And all the Presence whispered their cold fears Of the Kings wantonness and the Queens abuse; Didst thou not then still gaze upon his Face, As thou hadst long'd for more? O impudence! Alin. Impudence? Sir, pray give it the right name, Courtship, 'twas Courtship Sir, if I have learn'd Any since I came here. King. Brave metal'd wench! Sfor. I am amaz'd. Alin. Besides Sir, the Kings kisses Are great inestimable Honours, and VVhat Lady would not think her self the more Honour'd, by how much the King did kiss her? Sfor. And should he more then kiss, still the more Honour'd? Alin. It might be thought so. Sfor. Durst thou argue thus? Alin. I know he dares not beat me here. Pray Sir Let me but ask you this, then use your pleasure: (Cause you stile Impudence, that which I call Courtship) VVhat Courtier sits down satisfied with the first Office or Honour is confer'd upon him? If he does so, he leaves to be a Courtier. And not the thing we treat of. Did your self After the King had grac'd you once, twice, thrice, (As he kiss'd me) expect no further from him? Sfor. She's wonderously well read in Court alreadie: VVho i'th' Devils name has been her Lecturer? Flav. Do but your Majesty observe that, and think VVhat pains I took with her. Alin. How many Offices Did you run through before you were made General? And as the more the King confers upon us, Is more our Honour, so 'tis more the Kings, VVhen most his Favours shine upon Desert. King. I like her better still. Sfor. Insufferable Baggage.! Dar'st thou call any thing in thee Desert? Or mention those base Favours which the King Maintains his Lust by, with those real Honours Confer'd on me, who have preserv'd his life? Is it such Dignity to be a VVhore? Alin. Pray Sir, take heed: Kings Mistrisses must not Be call'd so. Sfor. Dar'st thou talk thus to me? Alin. Yes, Sir; If you dare think me worth the Kings embraces, In that neer kind, howe'er you please to stile it: Sure I shall dare, and be allow'd to speak. King. That word makes thee a Queen. Sfor. The King dares not Maintain it. King. And that costs you your Head. Alin. Dear Sir, take heed; Protest I dare not hear you: Suppose I were advanc'd so far above you To be your Queen, would you be therefore desperate, And fall from what you are to nothing? Pray Utter no more such words, I'd have you live. Flav. She vexes him handsomelie. Sfor. As I live she's mad. Do you dream of being a Queen? Alind. VVhy if I should, I hope that were no Treason: Nor if I were a Queen, were that sufficient VVarrant for you, to utter Treason by, Because you were my Father; No dear Sir, Let not your Passion be Master of your Tongue. Sfor. How she flies up with the conceit? d'yee hear? Alind. Because you were my Father. Soveraignty you know, admits no Parentage. Honour, poor petty Honour forgets Descent. Let but a silly Daughter of a City Become a Countesse, and note how squeamishly She takes the wind of her Progenitors. Sfor. She has swallowed an Ambition That will burst her: I'll let the humour forth. Alin. You will not kill your Child? Sfor. Though all Posterity should perish by it. Alin. Not for the Jewel in your Ear. Sfor. Impudent Harlot! she has heard me value This Jewel, which I wear for her dead Mother, I would not part with, whilst I wore my Head; And now she threatens that: a Kingdom shall not save thy life. Alin. Know where you are, Sir, at Court, the Kings House. Sfor. Were it a Church, and this unhallowed Room Sanctum Sanctorum, I will bring you to your knees, And make me such a Recantation As never follow'd Disobedience; I'll take thy life else, and immediately. King., Flav. Treason! a Guard! Treason! &amp;c. Omn. Heaven save the King. Enter Capt. &amp; Guard King. Lay hold on Sforza, the dangerous Traytor. Sfor. 'Tis Sforza is betray'd. King. Away with him, see he be kept close Prisoner. Flavello, see that his daughter have convenient Lodging. Sfor. Let me but speak; I hope your Majestyâ King. Let not a word come from him: hence, away. VVhat a most dangerous estate even Kings do live in? VVhen those that we do lodge so neer our Breast Study our Death, when we expect our Rest. Exeunt. ScÅn. VII. Enter Lodovico and Eulalia. Lod. Be comforted good Queen, and I beseech Your Grace to pardon me in this command The King has laid upon me. Eul. Lodovico, I do, and must no less submit my self To the Kings soveraign will then you: and though I am committed to your house and custody, I am his Highness Prisoner: and more, Though I know not my crime, unless it be My due Obedience, I am still so far From grudging at his pleasure, as I fear To ask you what it is suppos'd to be; But rather wait th' Event, which though it bring My Death, 'tis welcom from my Lord and King. Lod. VVas ever Vertue more abus'd then hers? Eul. Yet thus much, good my Lord, vvithout offence; Let me demand, Is Sforza still close Prisoner? Lod. Yes, and Petruccio his Adversarie Governs his Place, and high in the Kings Favour. Eul. I will not ask his Trespass neither, it Sufficeth it is the Kings high pleasure. But Alinda, Sforza's fair Daughter, what becomes of her? Poor vertuous Maid, is she thrown out of Favour Because I lov'd her too? Lod. Alas good Queen! Eul. What do you weep? nay then all is not well With her, I fear. Lod. Good Queen, I fear so too; And that all ill proceeds from her to you. Eul. I may not understand thee, Lodovico: I'll still retain the duty of a wife, Which though it be rejected, shall not throw Me from the path a Subject ought to go. Lod. Two such wives more might save a Nation. But see Petruccio the now-powerful man, under the King. Eul. Horatio with him too, are they such Friends? Lod. None greater since the King was pleas'd to grace Petruccio. ScÅn. VIII. Enter Petruccio and Horatio. Petr. Madam, howe'er my Person, no less then my Authority, I know is most unwelcom to you; I must appear, and lay the Kings Command upon you, which you must obey. Eul. I must? see, Lodovico, here's a plain- Dealing Lord, that knows, my Love and my Obedience to the King, and warnes me Faithfully to observe it: good my Lord, I will obey the Kings Command in you: Lay't on me. What must I do? Petr. You must go to the Bar, to answer to Those Accusations that will be brought Against your Life and Honour, as touching Your foul Disloyaltie unto the King. Eul. He is a Traytor to the King and Me, That dares accuse me of Disloyaltie. Patience assist me, and controul my Passion. The greatest Crime that ever I committed Against my Soveraign, was, To be so neer The Vice of Anger in the presence of One that he lov'd so well; but pray your Pardon, Though truly those sharp-pointed words drew Blood From my oppressed heart: and though you love me not, I hope you think me innocent. Petr. Would I could. Eul. You do. Petr. I would I durst speak what I think. Eul. My Lord, you ever lov'd me, can you think? Hor. Come, what I think, I think; my love to you Was the Kings love, if it were love at all: If he will say, he ever lov'd you, I can say so too. But to speak truth, I know not if I did, Or I did not; but now you're hateful to me; That I dare speak, because he hates you soundly. And your old Ruffian Sforza, that fell Traytor, That would have kill'd the King: do you look up at it? You may look down with sorrow enough: Your Country-man, your brave old Champion, He has Champion'd you sweetly it seems. Is there no honest VVoman? Eul. VVhat means this unknown Language? Hor. VVomen are alwayes ignorant of Reproof: I'll tell you what it means, for that loves sake You thought I lov'd you once. Or do you know VVhat Mars and Venus meant, when injur'd Vulcan Had e'm in's Net? Good King, how wert thou abus'd? And this good honest, faithful, loyal Lord, Full to the brim, of Merit, and true Valour, By that Blade-brandishing Sforza, that meer Fencer, To this great Martialist: but he is fast enough, And all's come out, howe'er you'l answer it. Eul. VVhat must I answer? I know not yet your meaning. Hor. Nor ever shall, for me. Petr. You'll know too much I fear, anon. Come, Madam, vvill you go? The High-Court stayes your coming. Eul. I must submit me to it, and its Laws; But to a higher Judge refer my Cause. Lod. Good Queen, thy wrongs are manifest, though none Must dare to utter them, but in our Mone. Exeunt Omnes. ScÅn. IX. Enter Alinda. Alin. Mount, mount, my thoughts, above the earthy pitch Of Vassal minds, whilst strength of womans wit Props my Ambition up, and lifts my hope Above the flight of Envy. Let the base And abject mindes be pleas'd with servile Bondage My Breast breeds not a thought that shall not flie The lofty height of towring Majesty. My power upon the weakness of the King (Whose raging Dotage to obtain my Love, Like a devouring flame, seeks to consume All interposed Lets) hath laid a Ground-vvork So sure upon those Ruines, that the power Of Fate shall not controul, or stop my building Up to the top of Soveraignty, vvhere I'll stand And dare the VVorld to dis-commend my Act: It shall but say, when I the Crown have won, The vvork was harsh in doing, but well done. Enter Flavello. Flavello, welcom! Flav. Hail, my Soveraign Queen. Alin. 'Tis a brave sound, and that vvhich my Soul thirsts for; But do not mock mine Ears. Flav. Believe it Madam, Joyn your attention but vvith one hours patience, And you shall hear the gen'ral Voice o'th' Kingdom Give you that stile, vvith large and loud allowance. Alin. Stile thy self happy then, in vvhat Reward A Subject can receive, or a Queen give. How moves our great proceedings? Flav. Fairly, thus: Eulalia, for now I must no more Give her the Title that belongs unto Your Execellence, of Queen. Alin. Advance that Harmonie. Flav. Eulalia is brought unto the Bar, accus'd, Convicted of that high offence, that instantlie Shall pull that Judgement on her, that shall crush Her into nothing. Alin. Appear the proofs manifest? Flav. That vvas my care, it behoov'd me to work the VVitnesses, vvho swore (in brief) most bravely, that they heard Lord Sforza, vvhom you also may forget now to call Father. Alin. That vvithout your instruction. Flav. They swore, I say, they heard that Sforza boast The knovvledge of the Queen in carnal Lust. Alin. VVas that enough? Flav. No, but it serv'd to put The question to her, Was it true or not? No, cries the Queen, nor can I think that Sforza Would lay that scandal on himself and me. Those Witnesses were two cashier'd Lieutenants That Sforza should have hang'd for Mutinies In the late war, but threw 'em by, it seems, To serve him in this Office: me they cost Five hundred Crowns a piece, and well they got it. But where I left: the Queen denies their Oath. And though it had been true that Sforza had Affirm'd as much, that had not found her guilty. Alin. What Witnesses were next? Flav. Two dainty devils Birds, a Doctor and a Midwife, who accus'd Themselves for Bawds i'th' Action, and depos'd I know not how many, how many, how many times, They saw 'em link'd in their unlawful pleasures. These were the Queens own people, and deserv'd A thousand Crowns apiece, and had it instantly, Afore-hand too. Alin. What could the Queen say then? Flav. She denied all, but in such a patient way, After her foolish fashion, that it gave strength To th' Evidence against her; then she wept For their iniquity, and gave them a God forgive ye. And so attends the censure of the Court, VVhich straightway will be given: they'l be set Before my coming. Alin. Hast, Flavello, hast, And let thy next news be to this a Crown, That she is not a Queen, and I am one. Exit Flav. This Father and this Queen I now could pity, For being hew'd out and squar'd thus to my use, But that they make those necessary steps By which I must ascend to my Ambition. They that will rise unto a supream Head, Should not regard upon whose Necks they tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II. ScÅn. I. [Loud Musick] Enter four Lords, two Bishops, King, Prince: they sit; Eulalia in black, Crowned; a golden Wand in her hand, led between two Friers; she kneels to the King, he rejects her with his hand. Enter at the other door, a Doctor of Physick, a Midwife, two Souldiers; the King points them to the Bishops, they each deliver Papers, kiss the Bishops Books, and are dismiss'd. The Papers given to the King, He with his Finger menaces Eulalia, and sends her the Papers: she looks meekly. The Bishops take her Crown and Wand, give her a Wreath of Cypress, and a white Wand. All the Lords peruse the Papers. They shew various countenances: Some seem to applaud the King, some pity Eulalia. Musick ceases. King speaks. King. My Lords and loyal Peers. Lod. A new distinction Between Spiritual and Temporal. Hor. Good Lodovico, peace. Kin. This is a Cause, the which, but for fair Order, By which I am constrain'd to be a Judge, Would rather drive me to a mourning Closet Then to this Seat; to shew my equal grief Against the Crime and Shame of the Delinquent. I see y'are all amaz'd, and cannot marveil At your Astonishment, who do suffer with you In the great Change Honour compels me to, Together with Religion, fairly urging To an high point of Justice, which to utter Draws faintness from my words, chilling my Blood Like the departing Breath that separates Life. For such I held her, and so many yeers Retain'd her in the Closet of my Heart, Its self-Companion: that till these proofs, VVhich now like daggers by compulsive wounds Have made their passage, she could ne'er have parted. Lod. Royal Hypocrisie! King. The Proofs you see are plain, That she was foundâPray speak it for me. Hor. In Adultery. King. And that she sought the Life of fair Alinda By Sword and Poyson both: and of that Cup 'Tis like my self had tasted, For my supposed love to that wrong'd Lady. Lod. You have given her the Bed-right that belong'd to your wrong'd Queen, these twelve months. King. Our Laws of Sicilie are so well rebated VVith Clemencie, and Mercie, that in this Case They cut not Life from one of Royal Blood, Onely take off (as is on her perform'd) All Dignities, all Titles, all Possessions, All means to live, even to her naked hands. And such, Eulalia, now is your condition. Lod. To work for her living? if she were as young, and no honester then she for vvhose sake this is inflicted on her, she might find something else about her, then naked hands, to help at a living shift- King. Now to this Censure, for due Orders sake, And for vvhich end this Parliament vvas call'd; Your Voyces are requir'd: do ye all approve it? Omn. VVe do. Lod. We must. King. VVhat say you, Lodovico? Lod. VVe do; Heaven knows against my heart. Eul. My thanks unto you all, that do obey So vvell vvith one consent your Soveraign Lord, And sacred Sir, thus low, as it becomes me, Let your poor Hand-maid beg, that you incline A patient Ear to this my last Petition: That as you cast me off, as an offence, You will be pleas'd to think me not offended, But pleas'd in all I suffer: for, Heaven knows, I am as free from any Passion Of Anger, Hate, Repining or Distaste, Nay, as insensible of Grief or Sorrow, Or whatsoever Anguish of the Minde, As I was capable, for ought I know, Of Joy or Bliss the first hour I was born. Never made happy till I was your Bride, In which blest state I cannot but remain, While you are pleas'd, and I obey your will, Though unto Death, to Banishment or Prison. Poverty is Blessedness, in vvhich I'll pray For pardon of the Sins of my Accusers, And those that have suborn'd them. Lod. O poor Woman! Eul. So in the blest continuance of your Dayes, I shall pray Heaven to smile on all your VVayes. King. Nay, stay Eulalia, I have yet a Business I would have pass the general Consent Of this Assemblie, in which your Voice is useful. Flavello? Exit Flavello. Lod. Upon my life, his Marriage with that Start-up, That Snake this good Queen cocker'd in her Bosom, Is not this Royal cruelty? [Gonzago kneels to the Queen] Eul. You wrong your Princely Dignity: Turn to the King your Father, kneel to him. Gonz. And are not you my Mother? Eul. I must and can forget what I have been; So must not you: your Mother was a Queen. My present fortune claims no Title in you. Hurt not your own, by looking down on me. This I will do as warranted by safetie, Not as a Mother, but Beadswoman, pray For all that bliss on you a Mother may, Good Sir, observe the King before his wrath. Take hold upon you for regarding me. [Loud Musick] ScÅn. II. Enter Favello ushering Alinda like a Bride, two Virgins. The King descends, takes her up: the Lords rise, all amazed. King. Let your amazement cease, and now perceive My Lords in general, that I your King Am Subject to this all-deserving Lady, And do require you not alone to hear What I can say, but without all denial That you approve, confirm what I will say. I am by law no less then your consent Divorc'd, and free from all impediment To make my second choice in Marriage, And therefore crave Alinda for my wife, And that immediately we solemnize Our Marriage, and her Coronation. I hope none rates our will or his own life So meanly, as to give least contradiction. Eul. O let me lead your voyces. Long live Gonzago and Alinda, King and Queen of Sicily. Alin. O gross Hyocrisie! Eul. My Lord the Prince, pray let your voyce be next; The rest will follow. Why speak you not, my Lord? Alin. She would fain seem to voyce in your behalf, But in a way that much perswades against you. Do but your Highness note it. Kin. You Sir, come from that Woman. Gonz. She was my mother when she was your wife; And that's so late, I cannot yet forget it. But I fear to offend. Eul. O shew it in your Duty then, young Prince: 'Tis true, the Law of Nature wills a Son To be a partner in his Mothers woe; But Laws above that lay a strong command On Sons to obey the Edicts of their Fathers. A Fathers frownes are Comets threatning ruine. Let all your thoughts be free from his offence: The most Heaven seeks, is our obedience. In all obey the King; think not of me: I am no more, nay not so much to you As is the Begger whom you may relieve, Since of all these comforts I am depos'd. Lod. Faith thou hadst not mine, good woman: I must not call thee Queen now. Eul. Or if you needs will think I am your mother, Let it be onely in the charge I give you, That since Alinda bless'd by providence Must be invested with the Regal Crown, You shew her that obedience befits a Queen, And your dread Fathers Wife. Alin. I fear shee'l turn him Traytor, if he give more ear to her inchantments. King. Ile shew him a way to give her thanks. Gonzago? Gonz. My Royal and dread Father. King. Put forth that woman: Do it without grudge, out of the Court, I mean to seek her way. Do you refuse? Eul. He does not, shall not, Royal Sir. Onely I beg that I may take my leave. The wishes a true Subject ought to send From the most humble heart up to the Throne Of sacred Majesty, I equally divide To you my King and Queen, Professing by the Powers you present, I part as well content with my condition, Since it is your command, as ere I was to sit in that Promotion. Alin. Sir, I may not sit to be taunted and upbraided thus. Eul. Pardon me, mighty Lady, I am as far From daring to do so, as from a Queen. And whilst you love the King, and he is pleas'd, I shall no less obey you, then I lov'd you VVhen I sent for you to the Court, and there into this heart received you. Alin. I am plainly jeer'd: hence that woman. King. Away with her. Exit Eulalia with Conzago. And let it be proclaim'd according to th' extremitie of Law our Censure be observ'd. Lod. Alas, how can she live one night? King. And now to your consent: have I it yet For Marriage with Alinda? If you are pleas'd, Then call us King and Queen. Omn. Long live the King and Queen. Lod. I mean Eulalia [aside] King. Tis well: on to the ceremonies then. Kings were But common men, did not their Power get fear. ScÅn. III. Enter presently again, Lodovico, Horatio. Lod. It is oppression, Tyrannie indeed. Hor. Speak lower, good my Lord. Lod. For fear of whom? of what? Hor. You would not that the King should hear you, would you? Lod. Faith if he did.â Hor. Faith then as sure as your tongue's your own now, your whole head would be his then. Lod. If it might so excuse the Queen, I car'd not. Hor. It will do the Queen as much good, as the money it might be sold for in the Market; That and the Appurtenances to it, would yield little at the Shambles. Come my Lord, speak privately, and purposely keep your head on your shoulders: it becomes the place as well as 't had been made for it. If the King have a mind to turn away his Wife, Ile give him leave to turn mine after her, to wait upon her, rather than to have my head bowl'd at her, though I were sure it should kisse the Mistress. Lod. Oh but the ensuing danger, my Horatio! The mischiefes that of necessary course must follow, even to the ruine of the State, by the Kings dotage on his second choice, draws blood from Subject hearts: Oh that lewd Woman! Hor. She is a Woman of middle earth yet. But what shall we dare to say two hours hence? Come, think upon Law and Regal Authoritie. The Kings Power Warrants his Acts: I know as well as you the Queen Eulalia (Heaven bless her, I hope 'tis yet no Treason to pray for her) is as vertuous a Lady as ever beautified a Court, or made a Kings Bed happy, For all the Articles fram'd against her. Lod. The perfect Pattern of Meekness, Patience, Obedience. Hor. Of all that's good, or should be wish'd in VVoman. Lod. So obsequious a lover of her Husband, that she gave way unto his loose affections, even to this now-she-start-up that supplants her. Hor. She consider'd she grows old: she reads in her Sons face nigh twenty years of the Kings love to her: and gives him leave to place it now elsewhere. Lod. And is so far from limiting his Choice, That she possesses it that seeks her blood. My soul tels me the witnesses against The Queen, are by this Concubine suborn'd. Hor. I will not say so. Lod. You cannot chuse but think so. Hor. My thoughts are warranted by the Proverb. But come, make up your Face, temper your voyce and looks with the rest of the most Honourable Assembly: shake off this discontent, 'tis a disease by which you'l perish else: now all the Court's in height; you to professe distaste! Come, be a looker on at least. Lod. Upon a Court on Fire? O Horatio, Bright Burning Troy gave not a dearer cause Of willingness to those affrighted souls She forc'd to leave her sinking in her ashes, To flie for refuge to another Region; Nor in their flight could they by looks reverted, See danger in more horrible aspect, Than upon the ruines of this Kingdom. Hor. Your stay, my Lord, may prevent danger. Lod. Yes, if it could remove the Fatal cause, The pride, the crueltie, the Ambition Of that wild Fury, the outragious Queen, VVho treads and tramples down the Covernment. Consider this Horatio, and the means To work this great effect: and I am yours, To stay till it be done. Hor. Alinda's Death. VVho's there? [Looks about] Lod. Is it not necessary? no body: what d' ye fear? Or can you find how to preserve the State At a less rate? you know too well the King, How apt his Nature is to fell oppression. The burden of whose crueltie long since, If by the vertuous Clemencie of his Wife It had not been alay'd and mitigated, Had been a general subversion. And now that Peerless Princesse being depos'd, Whose vertue made her famous, and us happy; And he re-married to this shame of women, Whose vileness breeds her envie and our mischief, What can we look for but destruction? Hor. I dare me thinks a little hear you now, (The Court being surfeited too with wine and noise) And could almost talk to the point it self, To your own ear. (Looks about him at every word.] 'Tis fit somewhat were done: I cannot say what: but if the wronged Queen Be not restor'd, we shew ingratitude, How much, I may not say: enough to damn us. Lod. I, now you speak. Hor. And though I will not speak it: if the Strumpet: Be not conveniently and speedily destroy'd, Though death dance with us in the enterprize, We shall seem born more for our selves than Countrey. Lod. Brave noble resolution! Hor. Nay more, now I will speak. Lod. This way, good Horatio. Hor. That way, or any way; If Poyson, Sword, Policy or Strength may do itâ Lod. Speak lower, good Horatio: see the Mignion. [Enter Flavello and divers Petitioners] Hor. What for him? my Ladies Game-keeper, that understands nothing but Monkeyes, Parrots, short-nos'd Dogs and Starlings; Master of her Majesties Foisting-hounds. Lod. So, he hears you. Hor. Let him; he has no Soul to understand, nor Language to answer a Man: he knows how to dyet, disple and perfume the small Cattle he has charge of; for which rare Art, and catching Spiders for principal Pug, he is rais'd prime man in his great Mistresses favour. Lod. How the Petitioners flock to him! Hor. Swarm rather, for they are Bees in his head; Oh! he engrosses all the Suits, and commends them to the White Hand, whose disposing will make the whole Kingdom black in Mourning, if Fate by us prevent not. See how he carries it! We might talk what we would, for him. His well-ordered head is so taken up with Particular Affaires, he mindes no General talk. But my good Lord, 'fore others Ears and Eyes, Pursue we our Design as all were Spies: You and the Common Good have won me. Lod. O I embrace you. Exeunt. ScÅn. V. Enter Andrea with a Box. Andr. OhâOhâand Oh-hoâO and alas! O and alack for OâOâOâthat ever a true Neapolitan born, should live to see this day in Sicily! there O-again, O QueenâO meâwhat wilt thou do? OâOâwhat shall I do? Oâthou maist work and starve; Oâand I may beg and live: Oâbut from thee I cannot live: OâI cannot, nor I wonnot, so I wonnot. [Enter Jago and Rugio.] Jag. See, here's poore Andrea mourning as well as we, And all the rest of the poor Queens cast-awayes. Rug. But I can tell him comfort. Andr. OhâI will hear no comfort. Rug. Yes, and be glad on't too. Andr. Is my Queen Countrey-woman call'd back again? Rug. No, but the Queen Alinda has enquired for thee, to entertain thee into her service, whilst we and all the rest of our late Queens servants are turn'd out o'th'Court, and now at this high dinner time too. Andr. She would eat me, would she not? Jag. That would make it a Feast indeed. Andr. But Ile not trust her on a fasting-night: Fools are meat then. Rug. Well said Andrea, witty in thy sorrow: I know thou wilt back again for a new Mistresse. Andr. No, no, take you your course, and serve her if you please, I have play'd the Fool too long, to play the Knave now. Ile after my old Mistresse. Rug. Thou maist not serve her: that will be brought within compass of Relief, and then thou maist be hang'd for her. Andr. If I be hang'd for doing good, pray let it not grieve you: and as I am an Innocent, Ile never grieve for you though you be hang'd never so justly. Both. We thank you good Andrea. Andr. Take you your swinge, let me take mine I pray. [Flourish] Jag. Hark, the King drinks now to his new Queen. Andr. So, having turn'd his old Wife out of door, A man may drink and frolique with his whoâ VVould have thought it? did you think to catch me? Rug. Not I Andrea. Andr. Catch me if you can: when it shall be Treason to say there is an honest woman, Ile say my Countrey-woman was justly condemn'd of Adultery: and till then, I know what to say: Catch me if ye can. [Flourish] Rug. There again: now the Queen drinks. Andr. Poore woman, at what River? Rug. I mean the Queen Alinda. Andr. O the new thing at home here; I will not call her Queen, not I: my Countrey-woman is my Queen. Jag. Why is not she thy Countrey-woman? Andr. She was when she was Sforza's Daughter: But she has turn'd a Father out of him. Rug. As here come some to turn us out o'th' Court. ScÅn. V. Enter Horatio, Flavello, Guard, two or three Gentlemen. Flav. Away with them: out of the gates, away. Hor. See, here are more of them: more of that hated womans Retinue: away with all. Rug. Beseech you, good my Lord: I hope we are true men. Hor. As I am true to the Crown, not one of you pesters the Court a minute longer: go, you are trash and trumpery: and Ile sweep the Court of all of ye: follow your Mistresse: go. Flav. The Fool my Lord shall stay: the Queen ask'd for him. Exeunt Omn. prÃ¦ter Andrea. Hor. Yes yes, the Fool my Lord, shall stay. Andr. The Fool my Lord will not stay. Hor. Will not? how dar'st thou say so? ha, Fool, ha? [Seize and rifle his Pack.] Andr. The Fool dare say more than the wisest Lord dares do amongst ye: you will not take my own proper goods from me, will ye? Hor. See what he caries: I heard of Plate and Jewels lost to day. Flav. Let's see, Sir, I will see. [Opens the Box: Coxcomb, Bable, Bells, and Coat.] Hor. Heyday, here's stuff indeed! Andr. Your VVardrope cannot matcht it: pray give me all again; or if you will be the Kings and Queens Takers with that extremitie to force my goods from me, then present this to his Highness, and this to Hers; and tell them, 'tis all the poor discarded Fool could spare them. Flav. No Sir, you shall take them with you, and a whip for advantage, unless you'l stay and serve the Queen. Andr. No Sir, to you with an excusee moy, If you be your Queens Fool-taker, you may In Countrey, Court and City quickly find Fools upon Fools that I shall leave behind. New Lords (you know the Proverb) make new Laws, New Lawyers of an old make a new cause. New workmen are delighted with new Tooles, And her new Majesty must have new Fools. New fools she wants, not having you about her, VVhile the old Fool makes shift to live without her. Fla. Let the Fool go my Lord, 'tis but a Fool the less, For he'll get wit by it, to wish himself here again. Andr. If I get but enough to keep me from Court, I care not. Flav. Farewell Fool, take your Trinkets with you. Andr. Farewell fine Lords, adieu old Courtier. Hor. The Court unclouded of this Factious crew, VVill shine on us that to the Crown are true. Exeunt. ScÅn. VI. Enter Sforza and Keeper, as in Prison. Sfor. VVas ever man so hurried into thraldom, And lock'd up in the ignorance of the cause, Stronger and darker than his Prison walls? But I must not be Sepulchr'd alive, And therefore Keeper, though thy office be More Devillish than thy visage, yet thy heart May be humane: let me then conjure thee To vent the secret forth but in a whisper; Or shouldst thou utter't in a Tempests voyce, As loud as are my injuries, thou art safe: I can be here no carry-Tale: I am fast In thine own custody, thou seest: I pray thee tell me, what's laid unto my charge? Keep. All I can say, 'Tis the Kings pleasure, and you must obey. Sfor. Do you barke Sentences, Hell-hound? Keep. My Lord, y'are off your Command, and under mine, You much mistake your self and me. Sfor. 'Tis true. Keep. Lions may rage in toyles: but whilst they do, They more enthral themselves: will you sit down, And promise on your Honour not to force My counsels from me? Ile deal fairly with you, (My meaning is, to give him never a word) Sfor. I will not lift a finger up against thee, As I am a Souldier: now prithee tell me, VVhat say they is my crime? [shakes his head] nay speak it freely. I can give it hearing: [shruggs, &amp;c.] Or tell me first if thou wilt, how fares the Queen? VVhat? art thou dumb to that too? Answer me, Is my Antagonist Petruccio Repeal'd to Court yet? thence may spring my mischief. VVhy dost not speak? this is dogged silence, In scorn of me, to mock my misery. I may not wrong the Honour of a Souldier In my Revenge, or I would thrattle thee. [he makes leggs.] You're very civil, Hell take your courtesie. Keep. I pitie him: but must not dare to shew it. It adds to some mens misery, not to know it. Exit. Sfor. It is decreed of me, that I must suffer This Barbarous crueltie; and Ile bravely bear it: I ha' not force these double walls to part, Or mollifie the Jaylors harder heart. May spirit then assist me to despise And bear my scorn above my injuries. ScÅn. VII. Enter Petruccio and Guard. Petr. Revenge has cast her self into my hands, Strangling the Life of Sforza in these Lines: His Head is in this grasp, but where is Honour? Must that forsake this Brest? must the pure heat Of heavenly Honour, yeeld unto the scorch Of Hell-bred base Revenge? it must not, cannot: For as the Sun puts out all baser Fires, Where Honour shines, thought of Revenge expires. Besides, he is below my Anger now; And has no Life but forfeited to Law, Or the Kings Fury, I'll not question which; Nor was it justlie, he gave me th'Affront, In being made Lord General, when I stood for't. But the Kings selfe, in his Election, He wrong'd not me no more then I did him, When th' Honour was transfer'd from him to me. That's answer'd cleerly, I acquit thee, Sforza. But now my Loyaltie, how shall I discharge That special Duty I am here commanded, (Stand back I say) to see the Execution, And bring the Head of Sforza to the King? What an addition here is of Advancement? To make me first a General, then a Hangman: I'll do him better Service: Loyal Horatio Would think himself now damn'd, to leave a tittle Of the Kings powerful pleasure unfulfil'd. Call the Keeper. Keep. Here my Lord. [Enter Keeper] Petr. I am to see and speak with Sforza. Keep. Then I doubt not but your Honour has brought VVarrant. Petr. My Honour be your VVarrant: will not that serve? Keep. I will not lose the Kings Grace for all the Honours in the Kingdom. Petr. Do'st know me, or my place? Keep. Yes, I both know and honour you, as far as my own place gives me leave: but in this I must crave pardon; you may not see him my Lord, by a less VVarrant then the Kings own Signet, and that fetches him out, and it please you. Petr. But have you been so strict to all men else? Has no man chang'd a vvord vvith him? Keep. Not since These Keys commanded him, I can assure you, Not even the Prince himself, who much desir'd it. I look'd as black on him, as upon you now. I am no white Prison-Keeper, I, to venture Mine own Neck for a Prisoner's, at a price, And give condemn'd men leave to run away: No, I am the black Jaylor, I, and 'tis thought, Lineally descended from Cerberus. Petr. I must commend thy Care; see, there's the Signet. Keep. I'll fetch the Prisoner. May it please you to come forth, my Lord? Ent. Sforza. Sfor. Have I then liv'd to hear Mans voice again? Keep. Here's the Lord Marshal, and chief General Of the Kings Forces, come to speak with you. Sfor. Those Titles once were mine, but now I must Attend his pleasure that is Master of them. Petr. All leave the Room, but be at hand. Guard. VVe shall. Exeunt Keeper and Guard. ScÅn. VIII. Sfor. My first object from my long obscurity, The man that hates me most of all the world? It is: his news cannot be good. not good? The better: 'tis best to know the worst; he cannot deceive me. Petr. My Lord, I do presume I am unwelcom, Because you are possess'd I never lov'd you: Sfor. The Court yields me such Complement; this has No ampler Comforts in't. But y'are deceiv'd, For you are welcom, sowre captious Lord, y'are welcom. Because (love me or love me not) you speak. I have been here these two and twenty dayes, And never heard the voice of Man till now: Meat I have found, and Lodging; but for Language, In what part of the world I am, I know not. Proceed; I value your words well, you see, That give you six for one; why do you not speak? I have been us'd to talk with men that love me not, And more with Enemies, I dare besworn, Then Friends: come, speak, I pray, what is't you come for? Petr. Alas! I pity him: his too too much vexation Has over-tam'd him. Sfor. Will you not speak and tell me? Petr. Pray let me ask you first; Have you been kept So strictly from the Speech of all men? Sfor. E'er since I was committed, and from the knowledge Of vvhy I vvas committed too; nay, he that keeps me, 'Till now he call'd me forth, never spake a vvord: If I ask'd him, what News? here he vvas vvith me: Or when he heard from Cuurt? then there again: Or, why I vvas committed? still the same answer. So that I could inform my self of nothing. Come, if thou bee'st an honest Enemy, Tell me something: As thou dost wish my throat cut, tell me something. Petr. You seem to take no notice of the cause of your commitment. Sfor. Further than this I cannot: 'Twas the Kings pleasure to command it. Treason was cry'd; a Guard: away with him: But for what cause, unless it were for drawing My sword upon (O that Rebellions Girle!) To save her from the danger of his lust, (VVhich I tell you I was doubtful of) and so Sir, Let me ask you, is she still about the Queen? My daughter Sir, I mean. Petr. Yes, much about the Queen. Sfor. And the Queen loves her? Petr. As dearly as her self. Sfor. Nay if you be a Souldier, now speak truely. Petr. The Queen and shee's all one. Sfor. Then there's some hope, The King yet keepes fair quarter with her. VVomen are quickly jealous. Petr. He knows nothing, I'm confident, of all these great proceedings. Poor man! I pity him: but Ile put him to it. VVill you now answer me as y' are a Souldier To some few Articles? Sfor. You have engag'd me. Petr. 'T were shame he should die ignorant of at least The Accusations are laid against him. Sfor. Come Sir, your Articles? Petr. You are accus'd Of an intended Treason 'gainst the King. Sfor. Who's my Accuser? Petr. Even the King himself. Sfor. Umh, umh, umh: he should not be my Judge then. It is some Devillish dream of his, or else That Policie that Princes purchase Hell by, With strong assurance without all exception; That is, when Souldiers men of best desert Have merited more then they have means to give, To cut their lives by whom they onely live. Petr. You flie now from the question: y' are engag'd by the Honour of a Souldier Unto that Accusation: guiltie or not guiltie? Sfor. I am not guiltie, as I am a Souldier; And in that Oath I would not be forsworn, To save as many lives, were they within me, As perish'd by my Sword to save his One. Petr. In that I am satisfied: now to the next, If you will hear it; you shall promise me To answer without passion I or no. Sfor. I will do what I can. Petr. You're next accus'd Of fowl Adulterie with the Queen Eulalia. Sfor. Hah! Petr. Guiltie or no? Sfor. No Sir, nor dares there be Such a suggestion in the heart of Hell. And were he there, that thought, or could but dream Of such a Scandal, I'ld squeeze it out on's Brains. Petr. Then I must hold you to your promise Sir. [Enter Guard.] Sfor. A wrestling towards; away west, away. Nay then I am betray'd. Petr. Forbear I pray. [Guard retire] Sfor. He comes but to insult and to torment me. Petr. My Lord you much forget, is not this Passion? Sfor. Passion of heart! he hopes not for Salvation That hears with patience but the repetition Of such a Blasphemie. I must not die, Until the world be vindicated from The redamnation such an error threatens. Petr. You see I could oppress you; but all forbear the roome. Exit Guard. Sfor. Do you come to mad me? Petr. If you will be calm, Ile tell you what I come for. Sfor. As setled as a Rock beneath a mountain Here will I sit, and hear thy loudest malice. Petr. If this man be not innocent, vertue lives not. Sfor. Now tell me what you come for; and be sure You ask no more abominable questions, VVhilst calmly I clear these, thus: By the Honour And faith of a true Souldier, I am clear Of these suggested crimes, which before Heaven (Which knows my Innocencie) I do not urge To save my life from the Kings violent Fury, Nor any way to close with thee in Friendship, Now that my fortune is at worst. So, speak: 'Tis long a coming: I begin to think It is some good, you are so loath to utter 't. Petr. It is, if you can apprehend it so. My Lord, I take you for my friend, and come To make my moan to you; insomuch as now I do conceive you Noble, Vertuous, Honest. Sfor. Foh! this is worse than all the rest, this stinks Of the Court-putrefaction, Flatterie, grossly. But on I prithee: talk is such a noveltie, I will hear any thing. Petr. I could not see your vertue, when it shin'd Thorow the radiant favours of the King: It dazled me with envie then: but now, Like the red Sun through cold and mystie vapours, I can behold it at the full. Sfor. So, so: umh, whu: so much for my vertues: What's your business now? Petr. I say I come to make my moan to you, Groaning beneath a weightie Injury The King has thrown upon me. Sfor. Has denyed him Something I warrant, that he would have begg'd; The making of a Knight, or some such foolerie: What was't? Petr. In putting a base office on me. Sfor. Is the great Marshals and chief Generals Office, become so base? Petr. No Sir, the Hangmans Office. Read thatâ I am commanded there, and warranted VVith present speed to bring your Head to him. Sfor. A prayer or two, by his great leave and yours, And you shall have it instantly. Petr. My Lord, you shall not undervalue't so: That Honour which has won me to you, shall Work better for your preservation. I have much more to tell you, and strong Reasons Why you should live: of the Queens infinite wrongs And yours, wrought by your Daughters cruel Ambition. Sfor. This is a nobleness beyond Example: Sure now you are honest. Petr. There you see my strength: If now for truth and Honours cause I strain A point of Loyaltie, you will engage Your Honour to secure me? Sfor. I hold my Honour equal to the best, And prize it still so far above my life, That to save Kingdoms Ile not forfeit it. Here in the sight of Heaven I do engage it, For your securitie. Petr. I ask no better. Keeper! [Enter Keeper.] Keep. My Lord. Petr. Dismiss that Guard, and give us way. Keep. I shall. Petr. Now come my Lord, vertue may be cast by; But never overcome by Tyrannie. Sfor. VVars Sword, Laws Axe, or Tyrannies fell Knife, May overcome my Person, not my life. For that is yours Petruccio. Exeunt Ambo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. ScÅn. I. Enter Eulalia. Eul. Turn'd out of all, and cast into the world; And that forbidden too to pitie me? No sucour, no relief to be afforded? Heaven still is where it was, and cannot lose The Providence it ever had: let those That think me wretched now, consider that, And be with me converted to a Faith That will proclaim us happy. What's my loss? VVhat was the State and glory of a Court, But steps and lights through dangerous Ambition, To ends beyond our selves, in whose atchievements, VVe make our selves but nothing to our selves. And all that we are then, is to the world, VVhich renders us great Titles: which tane off, VVe then return unto our selves again, And all the world is ours: I was not great Till now; nor could I confidently say Any thing was mine own, till I had nothing. They do but sleep, that live in highest Pompe; And all their happiness is but a dream, VVhen mine is reall: nay, nay, I can prove it. Their costly fare breeds riot, mine content: Their rich Attire is but mere Pageantry, Made to please their eyes: mine keeps me warm, And healthful, when a cold becomes their sickness. They boast of Honour and Gentilitie, For their Attendants then, when the chief Honour Of the best woman, meek obedience, Is my own handmaid; and my Patience A sweeter servant than Gentilitie, Continually my other: for Councel and defence, what have I now? They have the helps of worldly wife mens brains, And I the comforts of my fruitfull Prayers. They have tall big-bon'd servants for defence: I the strongst guard of all, mine innocence. [Birds chirp.] What Musick had the Court compar'd to this, Or what comparison can all their sports And Revells hold with those of Kids and Fawnes, And frisking Lambs upon the countrey lawnes? VVhich are my hourly pleasant entertainments In all my wanderings: in which I have not Hunger'd at any time, but I have found Meat which I duely earn'd: nor ever thirsted, But I have found a Spring that has refresh'd me. And am no sooner weary, then I finde A shelter or a shade to rest me in: As now, in which a slumber 'gins to creep Over mine Eyes, more soft then any sleep, Could these my Senses when I lay of late On Down, beneath the Canopy of State. [falls asleep] ScÅn. II. Enter Genius. Sleep in thy Sainted Innocence, Whilst Angels watch in thy defence. Sleep whilst I charm these bubling Streams With Musick, to make sweet thy Dreams; Thy Dreams which truly shall relate The Passages of thy Estate. Dumb shew. Enter Alinda, Flavello, two Lieutenants, Doctor, Midwife. Exeunt Lieutenants, Doctors, Midwife. Enter Sforza at the other end raging, and the Jaylor, with mute action. Enter King, Petruccio: Alinda whispers the King: he gives a Warrant and Signet to Petruccio: Exit Petruccio. King. kisses Alinda, graces Flavello. Exeunt. All this as the Genius speaks. Note, first thy Foes in Court conspire Against thy Life, and Villains hire To act thy Tragedy. Loe those the perjur'd Evidence That suggested thine offence, Are hir'd the second time to be Co-actors in thy Tragedie. They have their Fee, and now are sent Towards thee with a vile intent. Ill thrive their purposes. Now note The wrongs that are 'gainst Sforza wrought, Who lives from Speech of all men still, Pent by the Kings abused will; Not knowing of the Treacherie That was conspir'd 'gainst him and thee. Nothing of all that's past knows he, More then he must a Prisoner be; Which doth him much impatience bring: But the bad Queen instructs the King How his vexation he may end, Who strictly for his Head doth send. What from these black intents shall grow, Is not as yet for thee know. Now, holy Soul, I must thee set A course that must thy living get. Thou must not beg, nor take for need More then thy Merits proper meed. First therefore, I thy Brain inspire With a Divine Prophetick Fire; Thou shalt be able to Fore-doom The ends of many things to come. Into thy Breast I next infuse The Skill of Med'cine how to use: Learn'd Ãsculapius never knew The use of Simples more then you. Many diseas'd by Grief and Pain, Of thee shall Health and Strength obtain. Next Handy-Works and Literature, With Education good and pure, Thou shalt be able to bestow Upon the Country's Youth, and show The Elder sort how to improve Their Wealths by Neighbour-hood and Love: Now when thou from this Trance dost wake, See that thou present Practice make Of these thy Gifts, and fear not then The Practices of Fiends or Men. Exit Genius. Eul. What soft? what sweet? what heavenly Trance was this? I feel my self inspir'd with holy Flame Above the heat of Mortals: sure I have The Spirit of Prophecie, the Gift of Healing, And Art of teaching hidden Mysteries. Thanks Heaven, that first didst send me Patience To sweeten my Afflictions, and now Plentiful means to live, for others Good. Who live but for themselves, are but for show, And stand like barren Trees, where good might grow. ScÅn. III. Enter to her, Lodovico and Andrea. Lod. Farewel, thou foolish Pomp, and Pride of Court, Whose shine is but an Ignis fatuus That leads fond Mortals from the path of Vertue, And Tracts of real Comforts: thus I shake Thy wanton Dust from off my Feet, to tread The wayes of Truth and Innocence: this Air Breaths Health upon me, Peace, and perfect Pleasure. VVhere the swoln Courts sophisticated Breath Did but disease my Blood, and taint my Senses. Eul. It is good Lodovico, though disguis'd, I can no less then know him: and the poor Fool That was my Servant: they come to relieve me In these disguises, that I might not know From whom I receiv'd Comfort. Lod. To this way The most unfortunate Queen enclin'd her course: And see, already, how her VVants and VVoes Have worne her to the bone: Alas, she's pin'd! Andr. And look you new Master, yonder's my old Mistress; VVhat Fools were we, that could not find her sooner! Alas! I can see through her: there is not So thin a Queen in the Cards. Lod. Hold thee, good Woman, pray thee take it quickly. I came now from a Feast where we had plenty, And brought these Dainties, meant unto another; But my dear Charity tells me thou dost want it. I pray thee eat it; do not look, but eat it. Eul. What Traytor art thou, that presents me Poyson? Lod. By all the truth and honesty in Man, 'Tis wholesome Food: see, I will be thy Taster, Though in good sooth, it grievs mee to beguile thee Of the least Morsel: sure thou hast need of 't. Good VVoman eat, and let not Famine be Fearful of Poyson, or false Treacherie. Eul. Is it not Poyson to a loyal heart, To eat contrary to the Kings Command? Andr. No, if it were, what a many would have been poyson'd the last Lent, that may live to be very good Subjects, very good Subjects all the yeer after, except a few Fish-Dayes? Lod. 'Las, we are plain poor Country Folke, and hear no such news. Eul. VVhy will ye urge so much against your conscience? Have you not heard of my banishment, and the Kings Edict, Proclaiming all men Traytors that relieve me? Lod. VVe heard indeed the King had put away his old good VVife, and tane a new one: but can we think you are she that was the Queen? Eul. Yes good Dissembler, you do know't, and you; As sure as I know you for Lodovico, And you, Sir, for Andrea: Can it be, That you that have been loyal Subjects, should Now go about to forfeit thus your Lives? Andr. Pray leave this fooling, Mistriss: eat your meat; And here's good Drink to wash it down: and then If you have a minde to hang us, let the Gallows take his due; for my own part, I had Rather hang like a man, while I am good For something, then you should pine away to nothing. Eul. Fear not you me, pray Sir, nor neglect the care That's due unto your selves, to injure me. Lod. O dearest Heaven! do you think we'ld injure you, That venture lives for you? no, gentle Queen. Andr. Lo, there again, that's Treason too, to call her Queen. Lod. No body hears nor sees; pray eat a little. Eul. Do not I hear and see you? I am not safe In my obedience unto the King, To hold such conference with you that would So violate his Laws: but let it warn ye Off of this course; for I'll appeal to Justice If you persist in this Rebellion. Andr. Any woman but she, now in her Case, would eat such an Husbands Brains without Butter, rather then forsake good meat; and but for this wilfulness in her, I should not think her a woman, I. But as she is, new Master, we shall never do good upon her: and therefore since your Grace has not the grace to eat this meat, mark with what a grace or without Grace, I will eat it my self: do you fear Poyson? [Eats] Now Bottle let me play a part with thee; can you think this Poyson, that goes down so merrily? [Drinkes] Eul. Much good may it do thee. Lod. Stay, now perhaps she'l eat. Andr. 'Tis like enough; I did but eat to get her an Appetite, therefore I'll e'en eat on, till all be done, to get her the better stomack: now Bottle, to thee again. Eul. See, here come poor Folks, that perhaps do want That which superfluously thou hast devour'd. Andr. I'll eat again, for that: I am as poor as they; and you never knew Charity in Beggers towards one another. Bottle again for that. ScÅn. IV. Enter to them, Pedro, Poggio and Lollio. Pedr. O Misery! O Desolation! Pogg., Loll. Diseases, Sicknesses, O Calamity! Andr. What Saints are those that they invoke so? Eul. What is the Cause of these sad Cries, good People? Pedr. Go back, if you respect your safety, go; And look not this way where the Air disperseth Nothing but foul Infection, Pain and Sorrow. Return, I say, for here you appear strangers, And run not to the Ruine of your selves: This way is fil'd with Cries: you can meet nothing But Lamentations of a thousand Souls: Some Lame, some Blind, some Deaf, some Lunatick, Some struck with Palsie, some with Leprosie; All sighing, groaning, crying, underneath The painful weight of Sorrow and Affliction. Eul. What is that woful part o'th' Country call'd, That suffers this Calamitie? and how Did the Inhabitants there stand affected To Goodness or Religion? Pedr. We are all sinful: Yet no way to extenuate our fault, Or murmure at the Judgement faln upon us; We have been held obedient to the Church, True Subjects to the King, and friendliest Neighbours Among our selves, all Sicily could boast of: This part of it, or Province, being call'd, The fair Palermian Fields, and is the same Our Kings have customarily laid out For their Queens Dowry: and has therefore been Vulgarly call'd The Paradice of Love. Andr. Stay there, old man: I have heard there is Neither Lawyer nor Physician in all the Province. Lod. None could e'er get a living amongst 'um in all their Practise. It seems they liv'd then civilly and temperately. Andr. Nor Gentleman nor Begger in their Confines. Lod. Then sure their Wealth was all communicable. There could not but be excellent Neighbour-hood. Andr. And, which was worth all the rest, their Priests Were ever the best good-Fellows in all the Country. Pedr. Y'are now upon the Confines of that Country, And cannot scape some dangerous ill, If you dare tast the Aire of it. Andr. That shall be try'd; I'll have a whiff on't: If I get a mischief by it, let the Fools harm be a warning to the VVise. Pedr. See more of those distressed Souls that flie The foul Contagion, [Enter four Others. Exit Andr.] Yet charitable to each others wants: For here the Deaf conducts the Blind: the Blind Supports the Lame: the Dumb removes the sick and feeble. All that can make least shift for't, flie the Place, Then do not you press torward it. Eul. There will I. Take up my Habitation. Lod. Y'are not desperate? Eul. Mark me, good Lodovico, note my Reasons: This poor afflicted Province was my Dowry: And the o'er-hasty judging world will say, According to the Censure pass'd on me, My Trespass drew this Evil on the Land. Lod. Tis better that the world should judge so, and perish For it in it's Ignorance, then you so wilfully Be cast away: you hear that none escape. Pedr. None, Old nor Young, Man, Woman Child, all In one kinde or other, do feel Affliction. Eul. Do any die? Pedr. None, though the most do wish They might, in lieu of their sad sufferings. Eul. And whither now do you intend your travail with your griefs? Pedr. VVe hope a better Air will cure us. But VVe are advis'd by our Divines and Augurs, By the best means we can, to make our Journey Towards the Court, to send our sad complaint Unto the King. (Eul. Hear now what he will say) Pedr. They find by Divination, that this punishment Is falne upon this Province by the Sin Of the Adulterous Queen, whose Dowrie 'twas. Eul. Did not I tell you? Pedr. And that until His justice take away Her loathed life, This evil will not cease. Lod. What, the Queen Eulalia's life? Pedr. Yes Sir; we hear shee's banish'd, and forbid relief: But nothing save her polluted blood must quench this flame, In expiation of her Sin and shame. Lod. Dare you stay longer here? pray let us flie. Eul. Why then you think me guiltie, Lodovico. Lod. I know not what to think, but that I will not. Eul. Was that your Priests opinion and advice? Pedr. Yes, and thus grounded, that our pains began Just at the hour, the Kings Indulgencie Releas'd her forfeit Life. Eul. 'Twas everso; Priests are but Apes to Kings, And prostitute Religion to their ends. Might you not judge as well, it was th' injustice and the wrongs the innocent Queen hath suffer'd, that has brought sense of her injuries upon her Province? And that if she had died, her Dowrie here with her had also suffered Death? to make it nothing to the King, as he made her. Lod. I, mark ye that: and that your false surmise Against the Queen has brought this evil on you. Pedr. O now my pain increases. 1. O mine Eyes. 2. My Brain. 3. My Bones. 4. My limbs are on the Rack. Lod. 'Tis plain, your fowl mistrust is the infection that rages in you. Eul. Lodovico, peace: where is thy pain good man? Pedr. Here in this Arm shrunk up as it were sear'd with fiery Irons. Eul. Bless'd Providence assist me whilst with Prayers I use the gift thou gav'st me for the cure of these afflicted People. Give me thine hand: what feelst thou now? Pedr. A precious cooling Balm that has extinguished The scorching heat I felt, and has reduc'd My Flesh, my Sinews, and my Arteries, Into their natural temper and true use. Eul. Joyn that hand to thy other, and thank Heaven then That made thee whole. Pedr. I do, I do. Lod. Miraculous! Pedr. O sure you are some Heavenly Saint or Goddess. Eul. Beware Idolatry, and onely send All praise to th' power whose mercy hath no end. Onely do this for me: inform the rest How you have sped, and win them back again, To the next village: bid them be of chear, Whilst I make Holy Prayers for their help. Ile come and live among you for my hire, Which shall be cheap, believe me. Pedr. All we have VVill be too slight reward: first take my store. Eul. I will but take my next competent meal. I hope this will be thought but valuable. Pedr. I pray take more. Eul. Go back I say with your sad company, And comfort them with news of your success, And a full hope of cure to every one That's Partner in this sad Affliction. Pedr. With happy feet I shall spread it through the Countrey. Exeunt omnes Rustici. Lod. O happy woman, now no more a Queen, But Holy Saint: I see how Providence Means to advance thy injur'd innocence. Ile dwell here now my self, and without fear: For perfect health I think dwells only where Good Eulalia remains: I have enough To buy a Farm for me and poor Andrea. But what's become of him? Eul. Ile tell you, Lodovico: the poor Fellow Is gone to taste the Countrey Air for me, Lest I might be infected: you shall see Straight how he speeds. Lod. And that was honest love. Enter Andrea. Andr. A Surgeon, a Surgeon! Oh a Surgeon! Eul, How now, Andrea? Andr. A Surgeon: Oh twentie Surgeons, bone-setting Surgeons. Eul. What's the matter man? Andr. I am out of joynt. Ile taste no more of such contagious Aires, To save as many Queens as I have hairs. Oh Surgeons and Bone-setters, Bone-setters and Surgeons, all my Bones, all my Bones for a penny. I have not a finger nor a toe in joynt: my Leggs, my Thighs, my Arms, my neck. My back and Crupperbone is out of joynt. Oh for a Sowgelder, a Surgeon I would say. Out a joynt, out a joynt, I am all out a joynt. Eul. Thy tongue's not out a joynt. Andr. No, nor a Thing I have that has no Bone in't: All else is out a joynt. Eul. This came of tempting Providence: were not you Told the danger by the many that smarted of it? Andr. I met them all dancing and frisking home. The blind man made the way: the dumb man sung, The deaf kept time to his Notes: the lame led on The Dance to all the rest: whilst I can go No further. [lies down] 'Twas for you I ventured. Eul. And now you repent you meant me so much good. Andr. And now again I do repent that ever I did repent. Oh for a Stone-cutter, a Bone-setter I would say. Eul. VVell Sir, give me your hands: stand up. Andr. VVith as good a will as ever I stood to woman. Eul. Now, how do you feel your self? Andr. In very pretty plight, I feel I am sufficient. Haugh, heighâ[Capers and turns] 'twill do again: and if I durst venture into that unluckie Countrey again, I would now teach the Clowns how to Dance for joy. Eul. Yes you shall venter Sir; and by the way, Ile teach you to teach them to work and pray. Andr. To work and play I pray you, Lod. If there be Heaven on earth, it is this woman. Andr. Then if there be a Purgatorie on earth, Ile venter through it for her, heigh, o, ho. ScÅn. V. Enter three or four Countrey-men. 1. Health and Joy: Health and Joy. 2. O happy woman that ever she came hither! 1. Nay happy we that ere she came among us. 2. VVhat shall we render her in recompence? All that we have is too little for this woman, This good woman, this holy woman, this she-Saint, If there be one above ground. 3. O do not make an If at her, neighbour, lest the ground swallow thee quick in thy Infidelitie. 2. Now doubtless, and without all adventure, she is an unknown woman. 3. And therefore a good woman: for 'tis too true, All those that are well known are e'en bad enough: And known she will not be for all our entreats, No not so much as from whence she came, we see. 2. And that counsel she may keep still for me: For doubtless, and without all peradventure If we had need of another such, 'it were in vain to seek her. 1. Sure 'twas from Heaven she came, Where the whole stock of good women vvere plac'd long ago. ScÅn. VI. Enter Fabio and Strozza. Fab. 'Tis she I'm confident. Stroz. Our work lies fairly then before us. Lod. These look like mischievous Robbers. Eul. What can they take from us? Lod. Your Life, I fear. Andr. I have e'en din'd, let 'em take away when they please. Lod. Their looks are murderous. Eul. Fear not, Lodovico: why look ye Friends, so amazedly? ha' ye lost your way? or what do ye seek? Fab. No, we ha' found our way, 'tis to you we seek: we dare come roundly to you, for all your Guard, your old Fool, and your young here. Lod. O my unhappy Fears! Eul. You will not murder me? Fab. 'Tis all the Office we are bound to doe you. Eul. Just Heaven protect me. Fab. Call upon Heaven as you go thitherward: VVe may not stay long Invocations. Andr. Pray take me in your way, and run me through her, if you be honest Murderers. Help: Murder, Murder! ScÅn. VII. Enter to them, Curate, Crier, Pedro, Lollio, Poggio. Crier. O yes! O yes! O yes! Cur. Silence Crier, suspend the Proclamation, to prevent abomination. Lod. Heaven has sent us ayd. Fab. O we are prevented! Cur. On, on; sa, sa; down with their VVeapons, up with their heels, till we insect and rip up the intrails of the Cause: what an Assassinate was here attempted? O infausta Dies! two swords against the naked vvomb of a VVoman! and none but weaponless men to assist her! viz. Senex &amp; Ineptus. Andr. That is to say, Give me their Swords under my Fools Coat, I'll hurt no body. Cur. Upon my facundity, an elegant construction by the Fool. So, I am cedunt arma TogÃ¦. Fab. For our attempt Sir, we vvill answer it: vve are for the King. Cur. Then vve are for the King, Sir; &amp; in nomine Majestatis, we command you to attend our present Office, and then we will examine yours. Loll. And then if you deserve the Gallows, you shall be sure on't: a short breathing-vvhile shall be no hinderance to you. So Crier lift up your Voice, and proceed. Crier. O yes, O yes, O yes: By the Kings most Excellent Majesty, a Proclamation, prohibiting upon pain of Death, any Relief to be given unto the banish'd Eulalia. Cur. Now say, VVhereas upon just and lawful Tryal. Crier. VVhereas, &amp;c. Cur. The said Eulalia. Crier. The said Eulalia. Eul. I am that hapless she, that for relief will not beg, nor borrow, nor take of yee. [Lod. &amp; Cur. aside] Pedr. 'Tis she, and at the price of Life I vvill relieve her. [aside] Pog. How? vvhat have vve done? In relieving her from killing, we are all become Traytors. Loll. That's an idle fear: vve knew her not, VVhich now vve do, vve may again reliver her Into their hands, for them to kill her yet: And then there's no harm done. Pog. So let us give them their swords again; and vvhen they have done their vvork, to make all sure, vve'll hang them for their pains, and so keep the Law in our own hands vvhile vve have it. Cur. O homines insani! quomodo erravistis? The woman must be sav'd a manubus istis. They are Catilinarian Traytors. Lod. You Sir, have reason; you have found her Life The King has pardon'd: and although her Doom In this her Banishment were heavy, and A punishment even unto Death, but that Good soul she works and labours for her food, You find not yet 'tis lawful any kill her. Cur. Recte dixisti Domine: therefore Sir, You that are for the King, as you pretend, Shew us th' Imperative mood or warrant for her death, Or we shall put you into the Optativa mood, By punishment to wish your selves dead oftner Or more times than bona fide there be Tenses. In all the Moods of all my Accidences. Eul. For my part Ile forgive them, if they will Deliver truely who corrupted them, To rid the world of this weary burden; that I may pray for them. Pedr. Can such a goodness deserve so fowl a Censure? Eul. But first tell me: Are not you two the men that gave false evidence at my Arraignment touching injur'd Sforza? Fab. We gave no evidence, nor false nor true. Andr. No countrey-woman, they had no such But I will try if I can make 'm like 'em: O rare! what a nimble Barber am I? Lod. They are the self-same men, the two cashier'd Lieutenants that Sforza should have hang'd for mutinies in the late Wars. Pedr. What hinders now their execution? Cur. Digito compesce labellum: silence good Pedro. I do commend your zeal: but Periculum est in via, We will walk safely: for this time therefore wee'l do onely thus, Double our guards upon 'em, and away to prison with them, Est locus in carcere quod Tullianum appellatur. We will presume to know who 'twas that set you a work, before you go, Ambo. You will be made to answer it. Cur. A word more, wee'l hang you presently, and answer that too: Abite hinc in malam Rem: away with 'm. Loll. Ah Rogues, wee'l hamper ye. Pogg. Kill a woman 'cause she was a Queen? Loll. Wee'l hamper ye, and halter ye, and do ye hear? hang ye. Exeunt Lollio and Poggio, with Fabio and Strozza. Andr. Abi hinc &amp; malam rem, away with 'm. [Lodovico, Eulalia. Petro aside] Cur. As I am Erudite, idoneus Adolescens, A very towardly Juvenis. Cupis atq; doceri? Andr. What's that? Cur. Wilt thou be a Scholar? Andr. After you is manners. Cur. Now by mine intellect, discreetly spoken. Be but my Pupil, I will make thee one, And dip thy Caput in pure Helicon. Andr. Pray what's my Caput? and what's your Helicon? Cur. Still a desire to learn: this is no Fool. And by the company hee's in, I do suspect, Simile non est Idem: hee's too wise, To be the thing he seems but in disguise: Some Lord of Court, his outside non obstante. Lod. It is confess'd Sir, I am Lodovico, Somtimes a Lord of Court when this was Queen. Cur. O Oedipus! I meant this Juvenal. Andr. No truely Sir, your Simile non est Idem. I am no Lord, what ere you like me to. What I may pass for in the Country I know not, At Court I was a Fool when she was Queen. Lod. VVe dare not call her Queen now: but while we Relieve her not, though we associate her, VVe are the Kings true Subjects: and with your leave, Disclaiming of all Honourable Titles, VVe'll live amongst ye. Pedr. O gracious woman, so I may safely call you, VVho once preserv'd my life. Eul. Mention not that. Pedr. I ought not to conceal it: therefore know That some years past being imploy'd to Court To render the Kings Rents for this Province: VVhich though I duely did, there was a Lord, A strange officious one, that charg'd me deeply, And all our Province, with detested breach Of our Allegiance: at which my rage Banish'd my reason, and confounded so My senses, that without respect of Person, Or Place, which was the Danger of the Law, I struck him there in Court: and was adjudg'd To suffer death for 't, till you won my Pardon. Lod. VVere you that man? Andr. And 'twas my Cozen Lord I warrant that you box'd. Pedr. 'Tis he that braggs so much his truth unto the Crown; I need not name him. Cur. Sed nunc quid sequitur? Pray mark the issue of this Court quarrell. By the way, 'tis well you have renounc'd all qualitie of Court. Here were no living for you else; for know, Since this mans trouble, not a Gentleman, Much less a Courtier dares breath amongst us, But be as you pretend and write, but Yeoman: You shall live Jovially with us and welcome, At your own charge, your own Viaticum. [Enter Lollio and Poggio.] Loll. We have laid up The murderous minded men in dungeon deep, Clogg'd them with Ploughchains, Fetters and Horselocks. Pog. VVe'l teach 'm to kill Queens: Cur. Cave, caveto. Lol. VVe mean this woman, this discarded Queen. Exeunt Omnes. ScÅn. VIII. Enter Alinda and Flavello. Alind. For all the Feasts, the Triumphs and the Glories That have been spent, at price of great Estates, In celebration of my high Advancement; For all the King has in his present being, His Love to boot, assur'd in highest measure; Me-thinks there is yet wanting an Addition To crown my Happiness: all's not safe hereafter; I cannot safely say I am his Wife, While th'other seems contented with a Life. Flavello! Flav. Most Mighty Soveraign. Alind. O most CÅlestial sound! Here's all your business granted. Flav. Greatest and best of Queens! All? Alind. See the Kings hand to all: do you mistrust me? Flav. I onely look for the poor womans Pardon That kill'd her Husband for his gelding the Priest. Alind. If you but manage the Profits of my Favours with a discreet Hand now, you may soon finde the difference between a Mignion, and the Son of a Dish-Maker. Flav. I finde it in your Gifts, my bounteous Goddess. Alind. Oh Divine! Flav. And would presume that I my self were worthy A place i'th' Kalendar, might I do you Service, That merited the smallest of your Graces. Alind. Do you know the village where that woman lives? Flav. Who, sacred Deitie? Alind. I'm very sick to name her or her Son. Flav. O Eulalia; yes, the very House: 'tis in your Majesties way now, as you pass to Nicosia: the King is ready, Madam, and calls away; he longs to be at the end of his journey, to perform his Duty in the three Grants belong to you. Alind. O but that Woman, and that hated Boy. Flav. Eulalia, Madam? Alind. Thou art a base Ingrateful Villain to name her to me; Thou hear'st me say, I dare not speak her name, Yet thou dar'st stab mine Ears again, with it. Had some receiv'd the Favours thou hast done, Or could but dream of half thou'rt like to have, I should not fear her Ghost; but thou art dull. Flav. O let me take new spirit from your hand, And say unto your self, She is sure dead. But the King comes. I am enough inspir'd. Exit Flav. ScÅn. IX. Enter King and Gonzago. King. I will not onely have you guiltless, Sir, But free from least suspect; let but a spark Of Discontent appear upon your Look, I'll rip the hollow cave that holds the fire, And with Death quench it. Gonz. I beseech your Highness, If any alteration in my looks Be found, or read, let it as well be construed, It grows but from a filial fear t'offend. I have forgot I had another Mother: And humbly at the Feet of this I honour, I beg her Ayd, to win your Favour towards me. Most gracious Madam, if you knew the Truth, The fair sincerity I bear in Duty Towards your Highnessâ Alind. For what respect, young Prince? Gonz. The principal i'th' World: For that you have My Fathers Love; and but to Wrong or Grieve you, Were Stripes or Wounds to his Affection. So much of my late Mother I remember, To yield a Reverence to his Contentment, and shall for ever. Alind. My Lord, my Love, what pretty meaning have you? Do you bring your Son to mock me? King. Ha! my Alinda, he's no Son of mine, That with lesse Adoration dares look up On thy Divinity, then the Ãgyptians Gave to the Sun it self: but an out-cast Bastard, And of the daring Giants ignorant Nature, That war'd against the Gods. Alind. I would not move your Anger: pray let this win your Reconcilement. [Kisses] King. O thou art gentle, and the life of Sweetness: Come, my Alinda, I was calling you To our intended Journey to Nicosia, Where solemnly I will perform my Vow, To grant the three demands I promis'd you, In the full view of our Nobility. Which by the Custome of my Predecessors Have ratified and confirm'd the Power Of Queens, and made them absolute: have you thought To ask things worthy of your Dignity, Wherein I fully may declare my Bounty? Alind. I, Sir, shall be so reasonable, that I doubt not upon the way, or there at very instant, To crave past my Desert. King. O you are modest: but ask home, Alinda. Alind. And by the way, Sir, let it be my Suit, We give a Visit to distrest Eulalia; Wherein we may do Charity fitting Princes; (We may perhaps give Order for her Burial) [aside] King. Thou art all Goodness: Come, all Friends, Gonzago: But thank her Clemency. Exit King. Manet Alinda, to her Flavello. Alind. An Earldome be thou sure of, wise Flavello, To add to thy improvements: Though it be No full Discovery, I'll make it serve, As I will fashion it, to excellent use. Poyson or Sword thou heardst him speak? Elav. And in a menacing way: Now what may be Conjectur'd by such words, from men whose looks Shew discontent against your Mightiness, Rests most considerable. Alind. VVrite, Flavello, write, VVrite by that Copy in a States-Man's hand. Alas, good men! I dare even swear for them, How ere those words might fall in their discourse, They had no thought of me: yet this surmise Gives me an hint to try her Loyaltie, Or make her once more guiltie: for my State Stands by the King, as unto her his hate. Read it Flavello. [Reads.] Most Royal and most wronged Soveraign Mistress, be happily assured that the time of your Restoration is at hand: and that by no loss means then the death of that she-monster that usurps your Dignitie. All shall be determin'd at Nicosia, by Your devoted Servant unto death. Nameless. Alind. 'Tis well. It needs no superscription: only seal it, And think of your directions and disguise. 'Tis but your half days journey: and be sure VVe are not far behind you. Fla. I flie, my Soveraign. Alin. Now to the King, Of whose despight I still must sharp the sting. ScÅn. X. Enter King, and Horatio. King. No news of Lodovico yet, Horatio? Hor. None since he stole from Court upon the Banishment Of that false wicked woman, whom I cannot Name to your face or forehead, but I tremble. King. Because you fear all horned Beasts. Hor. My Loyalty forbid, And my infallible Truth unto the Crown, But I were sensible of the injury. King. I know thy Loyalty: but as for Lodovico, How was my Judgement wrong'd in him! Hor. And mine. King. I thought my self as safe in that mans Counselâ Hor. And so did I, By my lov'd Loyalty, think my self safe In his Advicesâ King. Yet methought he had A kinde of slyness in his Countenance. Hor. Yes, he had ever a kind of a slie look. King. That still methought I had a Genius That check'd my forward love, and did inform me That he would prove disloyal: and for that cause, To speak plain truth, I never lov'd him truely. Hor. VVill your Majesty believe me? I would I might never rise Into your Favour (and that I would not say For all the Traytors Lands in your Kingdom, VVhich were no small reward) if that were not My very own conceit of Lodovico That Traytor; hang him: what should I call him less? King. Yet 'twas given out you lov'd him. Hor. So 'twas thought your Highness did. King. And that he was your yoak-fellow in the State. Hor. Yes, when he's hang'd he shalt, King. How Horatio? Hor. Your Majesty knows my thoughts: nay I thank my creation, I was ever Just of your Majesties mind from my Nativitie, And in that faith Ile die. King. Here's a true Statesman now! Go, send Gonzago to me. Hor. My sweet yong Prince? I shall: but ere I go, Let me inform your Highness in my thoughts Of the sweet Prince Gonzago: if ever King VVas happy in a Son, you are in him. King. Go, call him to me. Hor. Cherish him, good my Lord: Hee'l be a sure staff to you in your Age, And prove a Statesman quickly: I cannot think, Except in him and your undoubted Queen, Petruccio and my self, True Loyalty lives. And here he comes: obedience in his Face Most brightly shining. Enter Gonzago. King. Wait without Horatio. [Exit Horatio] Gonzago? Gonz. My dread Lord. King. Did you attempt Against my strict command to visit Sforza? Gonza. It is most true, I did. King. You are a Traytor. Gonz. Gracious Heaven forbid it. King. What was your purpose? Gonza. First on my knees let me implore your Royal Pardon. King. Well Sir. Gonz. My end was noble: as I thought, well suiting The Honour of a Prince: I would have search'd Into the secrets of his heart by questions, VVhether he had intended or conceived Treason against your Highness, as it is Presum'd he did: for which he was committed. King. My self for that was his Accuser; How durst you then make a scruple at it? Gonz. Still relying on your Pardon, I had thought T' have won confession of it from himself. King. Suppose he had confess'd it? Gonza. I had then Concluded there had been a Probabilitie Of my poor mothers falsehood: yet I would have put That Question to him next. King. And say He had confess'd that too? Gonz. Then had I sav'd Your Laws a needless labour in his death; And with the same hand made that mother childless, That by her folly forfeited her Husband. King. VVas that your resolution? but suppose He had denied all? Gonz. All had then been nothing But a Scandal to my mother and himself: So good a Souldier would not be a lyer To save an abject life. King. Sirrah, you are His Bastard, not my son, in doing this. Gonza. You are my King, would I could say, my Father. King. Within there! Enter Horatio. Horatio, would you think it? this young stripling Takes part against me with that Traytor Sforza. Hor. Does your Grace think so? King. Think so? I know it. Hor. Then I know it too: Think, did you say? I think 'twas time to think it. King. I knew it not till now. Hor. As I am true to th' Crown, just now I knew it too. Gonz. O do not so interpret, Royal Sir. Hor. What can be said against it? has not his Grace spoke it? What must be done with him to please your Majesty? King. Convey him from my sight, and let our Marshal Petruccio take him to safe custody, Till our further pleasure. Gonz. My King, and Father. King. Hence with him I say. Gonz. Great Sir, your mercy. Hor. Did not I tell your Majesty there was not, But in the Queen, Petruccio, and my self, True Loyaltie in the Court? Away you Traytorling. Gonz. My Lord, you are too severe. Hor. What? in being true to th' Crown? O my Loyaltie! Exeunt with Gonzago. ScÅn. XI. Enter Alinda, Flavello. Alin. No news yet? no return? Flav. We shall have, Madam. Alin. You made not choise of men of Resolution. Flav. They were the same exasperate cashier'd Souldiers That sware so valiantly against Eulalia. Alin. Many that pass for Souldiers dare swear valiantly, That dare not fight. Flav. Many that dare not fight, Dare do a murther Madam, such a tame one too. I am confident they have kill'd her: however, I have done my best. Alin. Thou hast done nothing whilst that woman lives. The work was not so course, that your own hand Could have disdain'd it, Sir, if you had lov'd me. So leave me, negligent Fellow. Flav. Her first months Majesty hath wip'd out The memorie of all her former dayes. I must not lose her though: this hand then soon Must do the work, be 't not already done. Exit. King. How cheers my love? what ominous aspect Hath wrought this sad Eclipse upon that Beautie, VVhose radiancie onely is my life? Cast by this veil of sadness: quit my fears, And from my Browes wipe off a score of years. No? what must then remove it? or dispell These Clouds, that from the anguish of thy heart Do cast this shadow ore my happiness? Alin. I must not, will not name it: but you said You would do something, which it seems Your wavering love neglects. King. Can I neglect A duty that belongs to my Alinda? Speak it again: and by my first nights bliss I had with thee, by this kiss, and by this, Ile treble in performance all my promises. Alin. Y' are dull in your performances: I will Not name a request the second time, although my life, Your dignitie, and your Kingdoms safetie, Lie on the rack for 't. King. She will not name 't again: Her last request was for the head of Sforza, Her arrogant proud Father, whose perversness Checq'd at her due promotion; and whose life Swolne up with Popularitie, was my danger, Threatning no less then ruine on my State. She will not name 't again, poor tender soul, Lest she might fall into th' interpretation Of an unnatural child: yet for my safetie, She suffers in desire to have it done. I have prevented her desire, 'tis done: I know Petruccio his Antagonist, Who had my warrant and Signet for it, VVould not be slack in th' execution. Come, sweet, be fearless: that which your mild goodness Is now so timerous to name, is done. Alin. Is she pursu'd and put to death? King. What she? Alind. Nay, I have said again. King. Sforza, my dearest life, th' unnatural Homicide That sought thy life and mine, is put to death. Alin. VVhat, my dear Father? King. VVas it not your Desire? Enter Petruccio. Here comes sure Testimony: speak Petruccio; I will not ask, Is 't done? but speak the manner How Sforza di'd. Petr. A self-wil'd obstinate man: Such as he liv'd he di'd: and gracious Madam, That a more bloody Spectacle should not move Your tender nature to compunction, I brought But this inseparate Adjunct of his malicious Head [a Jewel] Against you, the King, and the whole Kingdoms good. Alin. This is a token most infallible, The Jewel that none but the cold hand of Death Could ravish from him: 'Tis done: The fear of him is like a storm blown ore: 'Tis done but this is yet but part of that full satisfaction That must confirm my safetie: Pray my Lord, [side] You fatal instrument of my Father's blood, Let me not look upon you. King. Nay Alinda, Exit Petruccio. You must not be so sad: your gentle sorrow In those obsequious Tears express'd, shew nature And Filial pietie as he was your Father: But think upon your wrongs, my dangers, and your own. Alin. Alas my Lord, think you withall, a Father Is not so early forgot. But sorrow leave me, And do you give me leave to think, that now It is no less a Childs part to embrace Revenge then sorrow for a Fathers loss. King. How means my love? Alin. She lives that was his Ruine. You may remember whom I mean: Eulalia. Till now, I had no Plea against her life: Onely my care of you might wish her Death, For your security. Her fowl Adultery And secret Practices against your Crown, Were nothing unto me, compar'd with this. Now I have lost a Father: she the cause: He suffers, she survives: where are your Laws? King. Sweet, be content. Alin. Content your self great Sir, With your black infamie: sit down content On your Majestick Throne, the President Of Capital contented Cuckolds, do, Till all your Subjects dance the Hornpipe too. King. Nay dear Alinda, do but thinkâ Alin. Think what? VVhat on a course to be reveng'd on you? To serve you in that kind my self? Kin. O torment! Alin. Or rather, let me think your lustful purpose VVas but to rob me of my Virgin-Honour. And that you put her by but for a time, Until my youth had quench'd your Appetite; Then to recal her home to your embraces. She is your wife it seems then still: not I. King. You have awak'd me from a Lethargie In which I was confounded! now I see She and mine Honour cannot live at once: She dies, Alinda. Alin. And you may consider A little further yet Sir, if you please: You Father and maintain a Son (your own I cannot safely say, and therefore more Is my vexation) who demeans himself Not towards me, like one that were your wife. King. Hee's also doom'd already, my Alinda. Alin. It may prevent a greater strife hereafter, Should he but live t' inherit Lands and Titles That must belong to yours and my succession. King. Thy wisdom has inspir'd me: all shall be (Be thou but my Alinda) rul'd by thee. Alin. Seal you that Grant: with this kiss I Seal mine: My glories were eclips'd, but now they shine.</field>

Y' are welcome Friends, your prayers and good wishes Are comforts to me, yet without danger of the Proclamation. Pog. Madam, the Court in all the Braverie It boasts and borrows, cannot so rejoyce In the bright shining Beauty of their Queen, As we in your enjoying in this plainness. Their Bells, and Bonfires, Tilts and Tournaments, Their Feasts and Banquets, Musicks and costly shews (How ere unpaid for) shall not outpass our loves. Eul.

But how you'll live, we know not: we are now In our old former Health: the Countrey's cur'd, Your Practice at an end: unless you had The common gift of most Physitians, To make as many sick, as you make sound, You will not find a Patient in seven years. Eul. But I have other Arts: sufficient skill In works of several kinds, the Needle, Loome, The Wheel, the Frame, the Net-Pin: and choice of Fingers works are most familiar with me. Lol. And can you handle the Bobbins well, good Woman? Make statute-Lace? you shall have my Daughter. Pogg. And mine, to make Tape-Purles: can you do it? Eul. Yes, and teach all your children works to live on. The which, together with my own labour, May bring sufficient for my maintenance: Without the idle help of Begging, Borrowing, Or any way infringing the Kings Command. Lol. You'l have a help beyond himself, but borrowing. Eul. Something I have in Book, to help their knowledge, And by practise give them literature. Then when these serious works and studies toil us, For Recreation, yet with equal skil, VVee'l practice divers Instruments, Songs and measures, That shall invite the Powers above to smile On the content of which we them beguile. Pog. Well Mistris, ours is the voice of the whole Countrey; All which, or what you please of it, is yours: Take this House: make your choice of servants. Take our children: make your own Rates for their Education. Our Purses and our lives are free to you: Get what you can, that's your own: will this please you? Eul. Yes gentle Friends, and with asmuch content As ere I found in height of Government. Pog. Take your possession then: and let Posteritie record, that without grieving A Royal Queen once Traded for her living. ScÅn. II. Enter Curate. Cur. Eho, oh, io, where is my learned sister? Eul. Why seem you so distracted? Cur. Proh Sancto Jupiter! Eul. Alas what is the matter? Cur. Hei mihi Qualis erat? Talis erat qualem nunquam vidi. Andr. Sure, sure, his Scholars have over-Master'd him, and whipt him out of his wits. Cur. Corpus inane animÃ¦, hold thy peace. Eul. Pray speak, what chance has happened? Cur. Non est narrandi locus: Go forth and see. Th' enraged Rurals are in an uproar lowd, each one an Hercules furens, a formidabilis formidandus Hostis: and quite against the Law Of nostrum est injuriam non inferre, Are on the point of making themselves merry, In hanging those ill destin'd men by th' neck That sought so late to give your neck the check. Eul. O let us flie to rescue them. Andr. Yet I hope Your hast will bring you short to cut the Rope. ScÅn. III. Enter Lollio, Poggio, and guard, with Fabio and Strozza. Lol. Bring 'em away to present execution: They have lien too long upon the Countreys charge. We have given 'em bread and water a whole fornight. Fab. You dare not do't: what Law are we condemn'd by? Pog. Dare we not do't? that word 's an hanging matter Here in our Civil Government: dare not do 't Sir? VVee'l do't; and when 'tis done, wee'l argue Law with you. Stroz. When you have tane our lives, you'l lay the Law to us: you cannot be so Barbarous. Lol. Impudent Traytors! how dare you say we cannot? yet because we graciously are pleas'd to put the Law out of our hands, and make you hang your selves, Ile give you Reason: Silence on your lives. First, know, lewd men, y' are Traytors to the King, In offering to be wiser then his Judgement, Which was but Banishment to the good Eulalia: Seeking most Trayterously to take the life Of (I do not say the Queen, but) the Kings wife Of most happy memory. Fab. The good Eulalia? Stroz. the Kings wife? Pog. That was: You shall not catch us tripping Sir, VVe are more than your match. Lol. Good I do say she is, and good again I dare pronounce her, that by dayly pain VVorks for her dayly bread: and for bare hire, Teacheth our children so, that we admire: The Infants who have understanding more Then we their Parents have, or then Our Fore-fathers before us had. Pog. But brother Lollio, make not your speech so long: what is 't to them? they'l carry none on 't to th' 'other world: let's do what we came to do, e'en hang 'em. Then, as I said, wee'l argle it afterwards. Lol. But brother Poggio, better 'tis they live A minute two or three, then such a Speech As I am now upon, be lost. Enter Lodovico, Pedro, Curate, Andrea, Eulalia. Pog. See what y' have won by your delay! if she prevent not now The good we meant her, I dare hang for 'm. Cur. In tempore venimus with a Reprieve, quod omnium Rerum est Primum. Eul. Alas, what mean you neighbours? would you now For all my labours and my Prayers for you, Blast me with curses of expiring men? What trespass have I done you, that for me You put these men to death against my will? Fab., Stroz. We do applaud your mercy, gracious Queen. Pog. There now, there they deserve hanging for that: They call you Queen, against the Proclamation. Dare you maintain 'em in't, and now speak for 'em? Eul. No, I condemn their faults, and blame their lives; But have nor Power nor will to judge the men: You have the will; but to assume the Power, You take the Kings Right from him: you transgresse As much his Laws in spilling of their blood, As they had done in mine, had they prevail'd. Andr. They do not intend to spill their blood, Countrey woman, they would but strangle them: never pierce the skin, nor make 'm an hair worse men, if you consider rightly what they are. Lol. But to the point. This is the All and some: We meant you a good turn, and for your sake t' have hang'd 'em right or wrong. Now since you will needs stand in your own highway of womens wisdom, which is wilfulness (Cur. A most Elegant Figure!) Let 'em and please you come to the Gallows another day for killing you out right: who can help it? Cur. Oraculously spoken: which of the Sages could have said more? Lol. 'Tis not unknown to you, that I can speak like a Sage, and am one of the Sages of our Precinct here for the Laytie, though your learning lie another way among us. I am a Sage, and will be a Sage. Pog. And so am I, and will be: and but that wise woman, which is as much to say as a fool for her labour. Cur. Another elegant Figure. Pog. But that, I say, she has gain-said it, we would; yet to shew our selves Sages, hang 'em up for Scarcrowes, to fright all their fellows for coming from Court to kill women in the Countrey. Andr. O how I love a Sage! how many Sages do you allow in your Precinct? Lol. Some three or four main Heads: we have now only Pedro, Poggio and my self: But we have many Powers under us: These now are Powers that execute our Commands. There is as much difference between a Sage and a Power, As between a Judge and a Hangman. Andr. But is not the learned Curate a Sage amongst ye? Lol. No, as I said before, their learning lies another way: we allow not our Clergie any Temporal Offices, for reasons known unto our selves. Andr. Pray let me have a Sages place amongst ye then: I long to be a Sage. Lol. Brother Andrea, you shall have my voice in your Election. Andr. Sage Brother Lollio, I thank you. Cur. But will ye now, if misericordially This gracious FÅminine preserve your lives Ex ore lupi, from the Gallow Tree, Become new men indeed? Eul. I know they will When they consider the most dangerous sin, That threw them on their desperate Attempt, And their escape from merited Punishment, They cannot be so graceless, not to turn To a reformed life: First know, yong men, Your former Act 'gainst me an Innocent, Was Perjurie by which I fell, yet flourish. Consider there how black and fowl your Sin Is rendred by my Chrystal innocence: Your next Attempt against me, was blacker, Murder, The very word sounds horror. Stroz. Gentle Madam, Name it not then: but by your sacred mercy, Acquit us of the Doom which we so justly Have drawn upon our selves: and we will spend Our lives in rendring satisfaction To your abused goodness. Eul. This is serious. Fab. Or may the earth on which we kneel for favour, Forc'd by the weight of our detested Sins, open. Amb. Quick devour us. Eul. So, enough: Ile take your words. Lod. But now you must reveal By whom you have been wrought to these fowl Practices. Fab. All, wee'l discover all, though justly then we pay our lives to Law. Lod. Good neighbours, Lollio, Poggio, and Andrea, conduct them to my House. Cur. My self also will to be their securer convoy go, For fear the Rusticks may presume again To stretch these penitent necks with halter strain. Lod. You shall do well: I thank your Charity. Lol. Well, since in these we are prevented thus, Come more, wee'l hang 'em, or they shall hang us. Andr. Make me but once a Sage, and then fear nothing. Pogg. Thou shalt be one next Sessions, without all peradventure. Lod. When we have tane these mens confessions, Ile write at large each passage to the King, Against the good Eulalia's will or knowledge Pedr. Ile be your faithful Messenger, my Lord. Lod. Thanks my good Pedro: but remember Silence. So deep in thought good Madam? Eul. Never enough in contemplation of my Happiness. Pedr. It is your Heavenly mind that sweetens all things. Enter one of the Countreymen. Pogg. VVhat's the matter man? Doubtless and without all peradventure, more miracles. Lol. The news, good neighbour. Countr. O neighbours Poggio and Lollio, such a news, such a Discoverie, such a thing is come to pass, such a business is come to light, as your hearts never heard, your Tongues never thought, nor your ears ever utter'd: you cannot hear it, but it will drown you in a Sea of Admiration, never to rise again in your right wits. Lol. Now am I mad till I hear it. Pog. Thou shalt tell me first whether it be good or bad, or Ile not hear it. Countr. It is good or bad I assure you: and therefore you may be gone. Pog. I mean which is it? good or bad? Countr. I say it is good and bad: and you may both stay and be gone, hear it or hear it not, an't please you. Pog. Nay thou art in thy Jibes now: how good or how bad is thy news? I pray thee neighbour, I do pray thee how good or bad is it? Countr. Nay then it is neither good nor bad, but both: the best and the worst that ever you heard in your life, and the worst shall out first: what do you think of the woman that we have got among us? Pog. Who, the holy woman? that we are all so bound to pray for? I hope no ill's betide her. Countr. Come, shee's a witch: flatly and plainly said to be a witch. Pog. Did not I tell you she was an unknown woman, and therefore a good one, quoth you? but say I, doubtlesly; and without all peradventure, all that she did was but a kind of witchcraft. Lol. It cannot, fie, it cannot be: how is she found so? Countr. I do not say shee's found a witch, but she's accus'd for one. Pog. By whom is she accus'd? Countr. By two brave men at Arms that came from Court VVith purpose to have kill'd her for the same. To be short, They found her out, and naked swords they drew: But as they thought to have thrust her through and through, They both dead Palsie-struck fall to the ground. And had no strength but of their Tongues to wound The Fame she had. Pog. Vertue can want no Foes, Count. VVith that they cryed she was a witch, and swore She also was that Queen which for a whore The King had turn'd away. Pog. This is indeed the best news thou couldst bring. Now doubtlesly and without all peradventures, 'tis the Queen indeed: and if she be not a witch, I am sorry I thought so, with all my heart: where be those men? wee'l hang 'm presently. Countr. No, the Queen, if she be the Queen, will not have them hurt more then they be: we were about to execute 'em: but she would not suffer it. Lol. Goodness it self! Pog. Nay without all peradventure, if there be goodness above ground, I said, and I say it again, 'tis in that woman. Countr. She would have cur'd 'em presently her self: but could not do't, because the cruel Caitifs would not confesse their sins, as she made us, you know, before her gift could cure us: by the same token I suffered an hours torment that I might have scap'd, because I was so loath to bring out that naughtie business betwixt me and the Millers wife. Pog. 'Twas well you confess'd at last. Countr. I, and they will be glad to confess, before they be able to stir hand or foot, I warrant: and so I told 'm when I lodg'd 'em both lovingly together upon straw in my Barn, too good for 'em; and so I told 'em too, for being Traytors to her Holiness. Lol. But where's our Holy woman? Pog. Our Queen wee'l call her now, without all peradventure. Lol. Coming this way to her Court-Cottage here, but very slowly, though our two new neighbours make the best way they can for her through the People that press upon her so with thanks and offerings for their new Healths: but she takes not so much for curing of a thousand mortal People, as I have spent in Turpentine and Tarre to keep my Flocklings cleanly in a Spring time. Hark, she comes: this is her Musick where ere she goes. [Shout within.] All. Heaven bless our Holy woman. ScÅn. III. Enter Lodovico, Eulalia, Andrea. Lod. Depart good neighbours, good people all depart: shee'l come abroad again to morrow. Within Heaven bless our Holy woman. Andr. She thanks you all good People, pray depart, To morrow you shall have the second part: She shall appear again unto you; pray depart, The men in Peace, the Wives in quietness, And let your bigger children still the less. [All Within.] Heaven bless our Holy woman. Andr. So, now the Hubbub's gone: I pray pass on. I shall be as weary of the Cottage, as of the Court, If this noise hold: here's thrusting and crowding As much as there, onely here they have less Pride. Eul. VVas ever comfort in the Court like this? Lod. I never liv'd till now. Enter three country-men more. Andr. Here come more of our weather-headed wise neighbours. Pog. Heaven bless our Holy woman. 1. Heaven bless your Holiness. 2. Nay then Heaven bless our Sacred Soveraign. Eul. This Homage fits not me. 1. We had not liv'd but by your sacred means; And will no longer live then be your Subjects. Eul. You go about to cast away your lives: In serving or in succouring me, you fall Into Rebellion against the King. 2. We have no King nor Queen but you. Heaven bless yor Majesty. Omn. Heaven bless your Majestie. Andr. That was pronounc'd bravely; O my brave new neighbours! Eul. Y' are Traytors All. 1. In honouring our Soveraign? Andr. I, well said, hold her to it. Eul. How dare you call me so? 2. VVe dare, and can prove it good and lawful. This Province is engag'd unto you Madam, The King made it your Joynture: and we find No reason but you instantly possesse it. Eul. VVhat, and the King alive? 1. He's dead to you. Lol. Yes, yes, he's dead to you. Andr. VVell said again: that's a sound point, besworn These be true Blades. Eul. I tremble but to hear you, And will not live an hour amongst you more But with this freedom, To use my fair obedience to the King. 2. You shall obey the King then, and we'll obey your Majesty. Eul. O let that Title die with my late Fortune: Remember it no more, but let me be As one of you; nay rather, an Inferior, Or I from this abiding must remove: Of which I first made choice in truth for love. 3. O Madam! Eul. Take heed good neighbours, Beware how you give Dignitie or Title; therein you may transgress. 2. No whit good Madam. Observe the Dialect of France, And you shall find Madam given there in Courtesie, To women of low Fortunes, unto whom 'Tis held a poore addition, though great Queens Do grace and make it Royal. Eul. 'Tis then the Greatness of The Person dignifies the Titles, not it the Person. 1. And in that, Madam, you are in your content Above all Title's proper to great Princes: But setting this aside, how thrive your Scholars? Eul. We go fairly on. [Enter 1. Girl.] look you Sir, Here's one that knew no letter in the Book Within these ten days, can read hitherto, And waits for a new lesson: proceed hitherâ And at your hour Ile hear you. 1. Girl. Yes forsooth Mistresse. Enter 2. Girl. Eul. Good Girl, well said: nay, nay, hold up your head: so, so, 'tis very well: let's see your Samplar: what an hearts ease is here! Lod. Right in its perfect Colours. Eul. Nay shee'l do well: now take me out this Flower. Keep your work clean, and you shall be a good Maid. Enter 3. Girl. Now where's your writing book? 3. Girl. 'Tis here forsooth. Pray shall I have a Joyn-hand Copy next? Eul. No child, you must not Joyn-hand yet: you must your letters and your minums better first. Take heed, you may Joyn-hand too soon, and so mar all: still youth desires to be too forward. Go take your Lute, and let me hear you sing the last I taught you. [Song] Enter 4. Girls. ScÅn. IV. Enter Doctor and Midwife. Lod. Whither do you press? who would you speak withall? Doctor. O Sir, for Charity sake give us access unto the holy woman. Lod. Who are you? or from whence? Doct. We are poor Pilgrims man and wife, that are upon our way struck with sad pain and sorrow. Andr. Alas poor Pilgrims! here's she must do you good. Eul. How divine Justice throwes my Enemies into my hands? what are your griefes? Doct. My wife is struck with dumbness. Andr. Hold a little, That's the greatest grief a woman can endure; But trouble not thy self to seek for cure. Too many a man i'th' world will change with thee A wife that of her Language is too free, And give good Boot. Eul. Pray Sir be you silent. And where's your pain? Doct. Here in this hand; Which I desire to shew in some more privacie. Eul. Because your Blow cannot be safely given here, you think. O sinful wretch! thou hadst no pain till now; Nor was she dumb till divine Providence Now at this instant struck her. It is now Just as thou saist: and justly are you punished For treacherous counterfeits. Lodowick search his hand. Lod. His hand is wither'd, and lets fall a Knife. Andr. As sharp to do a mischief as ere was felt on. Eul. Now take off his false Beard: see if you know him, And let the woman be unmuffled. Lod. O Divels! Andr. O the last couple that came out of Hell! Lod. These are the other two that damn'd themselves In perjurie against you at your Tryal. Andr. How do you master Doctor, and Mistress Midwife? Is this the Pen your Doctorship prescribes with? This might soon write that might cure all diseases: And are these the Labours you go to, Mistress Midnight? VVould you bring women to bed this way? Omn. O damnable conspirators! Eul. Pray take 'm hence, their time's not come for cure yet. Andr. Come away Pilgrims: we'll cure 'em for you, If your own salves can cure you: O my sweet Pilgrims. 1. Fough, they stink of Treason damnably 2. VVhat, shall we hang'm? drown 'em? or burn 'em? 1. They shall taste fortie deaths, then take their own. 2. I, come away with 'em: they shall die fortie times without peradventure, Eul. You shall lose me, if you do any violence to any of 'em: but let 'm be lodg'd with those we took to day: Ile feed 'em all. Andr. They'l be a jolly company. Eul. Pray do as I intreat. 3. You shall in all command us. 1. Ile make my Barn a spittle for your conspirators till it be top full, and then set fire on't, and please you. Eul. Do you no harm, and fear none: send your Children. 2. Omn. Long live our Queen. Andr. Your Queen? have you a mind to be hang'd? Omn. our School-Mistress, we would say. Eul. VVe live secure in spight of Foes: and see, Where Heaven protects, in vain is Treacherie: VVho says out State is low, or that I fell When I was put from Court? I did not rise Till then, nor was advanc'd till now. I see Heaven plants me 'bove the reach of Treachery. Lod. O happie, happie Saint! Ex. Rustici with Doct. and Midwife. ScÅn. V. Enter Flavello, alias Alphonso, with a Letter to Eulalia, Poggio and Lollio following. Lol. I would she had a Councel: she shall have a Councel, And we will be the Heads thereof, Though I be put to the pains to be President my self. Pog. It is most requisite for her safety: her danger may be great. A good guard then in my opinion were more requirable. Lol. 'Tis well consider'd: she shall have a Guard too: and we will be the limbs thereof, though I be put to the trouble of Captain on't my self. Pog. You will put on all Offices, yet count 'em pain and trouble. Lol. Yes, and perform 'em too here in our Court of Conscience, for here's no other profit to hinder the Dutie: let them above do what they list; we will have as much care of our School-Mistress, as they of their Semiramis: I speak no Treason nor no trifles neither, if you mark it. But she must never know this care of ours, She'll urge the Statute of Relief against it. Pog. This is some Courtier sure that's with her; he smells ill favordly. Lol. That made me dog him hither. Pog. He shall not have her out of sight, that's certain. Lol. Nor out of reach neither: a mischief's quickly done. Eul. No Superscription, nor any names unto it. Most Royal and most wronged Soveraign Mistress: (that must needs be me.) Be happily assured your Restauration is at hand; And by no less means then by her Death that usurps your Dignitie: (a plain conspiracie against Alinda in my behalf.) All shall be determined at Nicosia, by Your Loyal Servants. Nameless. Eul. You know not the contents then, and are bound by Oath you say not to reveal the senders of this Letter. Alph. It is most true: onely thus much I tell you, they are your noble and best chosen Friends. Eul. Heaven! can it be, that men in my respect can plunge into such danger? Alph. So Madam, this being all I had in charge, I must crave leave (indeed I do not like this Oportunitie, nor well the countenances of these Hobnols. [aside] Eul. You are no messenger of such ill Tidings To part so slightly: indeed you shall not. Alph. She's honied with the newes: I have already Madam my Reward, and will no longer stay. Eul. Then I must say, you shall stay: or Ile send A cry as loud as Treason after you. Alph. You'l wrong your self and Friends then. Omn. You wrong your self Sir, and we charge you stay. Alph. By the command of Peasants? Lol. How! you choplogical Rascal, Peasants! Pog. Down with him into utter darkness. Eul. No violence good Friends: but if you will detain him Till I give order for his libertie, You do the State good service. Lol. May it do you Service? Pog. The State is finely serv'd already. Eul. Me most of all. Lol. Hell cannot hold him faster then. Alph. Madam, hear me. Lol. Mad Asse, hold your prating till she calls you: Mean time you are fast: 'twas time we were a Councel or a Guard. Exeunt with Alphonso. Eul. I thank thee Providence, I dreamed not of such ready help. I am struck through with wonder at this Letter: I could not at the first but think't a Bayt To catch my willingness to such an Act; Or Gullerie to mock my Hopes or wishes, In case I had such: therefore I desired The Messengers restraint from being my Relator: But now a strong Belief possesses me, A noble Fury has stirr'd up some Friends To this high enterprize: whereby I gather My cause is weigh'd above, whence I shall see How well my patience over-rules my wrong, And my Foes ruin'd with mine Honours safety. But let my better Judgement weigh those thoughts, I do not seek revenge, why shall I suffer it? My causeless injuries have brought me Honour, And 'tis her shame to hear of my mis-hap. And if by Treachery she fall, the world Will judge me accessarie, as I were indeed In this foreknowledge of the foul intent, Should I conceal it. Then here's the trembling doubt which way to take: Whether to rise by her Destruction, Or sink my Friends, discovering their pretence. Friends have no Priviledge to be treacherous: She is my Soveraignes wife, his chief content; Of which to rob him, were an act of horrour Committed on himself. The question's then, Whether it be more foul ingratitude To unknown Friends, and for an act of Sin, Then to be treacherous to the Prince I love? It is resolv'd: Ile once more see the Court. Lollio, Poggio and Countreymen return. O my good Patrons, I must now intreat Means for my Journey to attend the King, On a discoverie for the present safetie Of his fair Queen: she will be murder'd else. Pog. And let her go: we have shut up your newsbringer safe enough, will keep you by your favour, short enough from hindring such a work. Eul. Dear Friends, a small matter will prevent this world of dangers. Lol. Would you have us to become Traytors, to Supply your wants against the Proclamation? If you be well, remain so: your Industry Can keep you here: but for a Journey, that Requires Horses and Attendants: money must he had, Which we have not for such an idle purpose. Eul. O hear me. Pog. Will you neglect your House and Trade to meddle any more with State-matters? Pog. And bring our necks in danger to assist you? Let your own counsell advise you to stay. Exeunt. ScÅn. VI. Enter King, Petruccio. King. How died the Boy? Petr. Gonzago Sir, your Son? King. My Son, my Son? you urge the name of Son To work remorse within me, when I ask How died that Bastard Boy; no Son of mine. Petr. His last words that he spake to me, were these: Go, tell the King my Father, that his frown Hath pierc'd my heart: tell him, if all his Land Be peopled with obedient hearts like mine, He needs no lawes to second his displeasure, To make a general Depopulation: But that he may not lose so much, I pray That in my Death his misse-plac'd anger die, And that his wrath have double force 'gainst those That to his Person and his Laws are Foes. King. Did he say so? Petr. And then, as if the Spirit of Prayer Had onely been habitual in his soul, He did implore Heaven's goodness to come down, Lifting him hence to shine upon your Crown. King. This Boy yet might be mine, though Sforza might have wrong'd me by the By. Petr. This done, he pray'd me leave the Roome. I wept: In sooth I could not chuse. King. Well, well, you wept, return'd, and found him dead in 's Bed you say. Petr. Yes, in so sweet a Posture, as no Statuarie With best of skill on most immaculate Marble Could fashion him an Image purer, slighter. King. No more. Petr. I found his stretch'd-out fingers which so lately Had clos'd his eyes, still moistned with his tears; And on his either cheek a tear undryed, Which shone like Stars. King. It seems he wept and died. Prithee no more: I cannot though forget My threatnings were too sharp: I must forget it. I charge you that you leavy up our Army Against those Rebels that we hear give succour Unto the wretched cause of all my mischiefes, That hated ill-liv'd woman. ScÅn. VII. Enter Horatio. Hor. O my dread liege? King. The matter? speak; how does the Queen? Hor. O the sweet Queen! I fear, I fear, I fear. King. What fearst thou? speak the worst I charge thee. Hor. I fear she has a Moonflaw in her brains: She chides and fights that none can look upon her. Her Fathers Ghost, is in her I think: here she comes. Alin. Where's this King? this King of Clouts, Petr. Fearful effect of Pride! Alin. This shadow of a King, that stands set up As in a Press among the Raggs and Vizors That represent his deceas'd Ancestors. King. What means my love? Alin. Your love? where is your love? Where is the preparation that you promis'd Of strength to tear in pieces that vile Witch That lives my souls vexation? your love? You are a load of torment: your delays To my desires are Hellish cruelties. Are these your Promises? [Horatio holds up his hands.] King. I have given order with all speed I could. Alin. You could cut off an old man in a Prison, That could make no resistance, and you could Vex a poor Boy to death, that could but cry In his defence; that you could do; but this That has so much shew of fear or hardness, As a few Peasants to maintain a Strumpet Against your Dignitie, is too much to do For a poor coward King. Petr. What a tyrannous Ambition Has the Devil puff'd up this Bladder with! King. I fear her wits are craz'd indeed. Alinda, Hear me gentle love. Alin. O my torment! Hor. As I am true to the Crown, I know not what to say to this: she's falling mad sure. Alin. No, no, you dare not do't: your Army may Perhaps i'th' dangerous Action break a shin, Or get a bloody nose: it now appears My Father (as 'twas voyc'd) was all your valour. Y' have never a Mars or Cuckold-making General Now left: and for your self, you 'r past it. Hor. His 'tother wife would not have us'd him thus. Quiet Cuckoldrie is better then scolding chastitie all the world over. King. I see distraction in her face. Alin. Did all your brave Commanders die in Sforza? Petr. By the Kings favour Madam (not to stir The dust of your dead Father) he has Souldiers That know to lead and execute no less Then did victorious Sforza. Alin. Sirrah! you have stirr'd more then his dust; you have mov'd his blood in me, unto a Justice that claims they trayterous head. Petr. My head? and Trayterous? I do appeal unto the King. Alin. A King? a Cobweb. Hor. And she the Spider in't I fear. My Loyaltie knowes not how to look upon her. Alin. If thou beest King, thou yet art but that King That ows me love and life, and so my subject. King. Indeed Alinda!â Alin. Yes indeed Gonzago, Life by inheritance: for my valiant Father Whose life thou tookst, gave thine, and so 'tis mine. And for your love, you dare not wrest it from me; Therefore deny not now my just demand, In that proud Traytors head. Hor. She's mad beyond all cure. King. Examine his offence, my dear Alinda. Alin. Is't not enough Alinda doth command it? Are these the Articles you gave me grant of? Is this the nothing that you would deny me? King. Sweet, weigh but his offence. Alin. His Head is my offence: and give me that Now, without pause, or by the strength of Hercules Ile take thee by the Horns, and writhe thine own off. King. Go from her sight Petruccio; levie up our Forces, And let the Boy Gonzago be embowell'd, And sent as a forerunner of our Furie Unto that Witch, contriver of these woes. Petr. 'Tis done, my liege. [Exit Petruccio.] Alin. Was ever woman barr'd her will, as I am? Hor. Here's a fine woman spoil'd now, by humoring her at first, and cherishing her Pride. Alin. Sure you have but mock'd me all this while: I am no wife, no Queen, but silly Subject. King. 'Tis a disease in her that must be sooth'd: Sweet, thou shalt have his Head. Alin. O, shall I so? King. Go in, it shall be brought thee. Alin. Mark what I say to bind you to your word: Do it, or Ile not love you: I can change Love into hate, hate into love most sweetly: Let that man live to morrow, Ile love him, And do fine feats with him, such as your tother wife And Sforza did; but make much better sport on't. They were an old dry couple. Hor. Take this, take all. Alin. I leave all to your Kingly consideration: You know your charge: look to't, and so I leave you. Exit. King. What wild Affections do in women raign! But this a Passion past all President. O 'tis meer Madness, mix'd with Divellish cunning, To hurl me upon more and endless mischiefes: It has awak'd me to the sight of those My fury (sprung from Dotage) hath already Laid in my Path, grim Spectacles of horror, The blood of Sforza, and that tender Boy: O let me think no further, yet stay there: To plunge at first into too deep a Sense Of soul-afflicting terrours, drowns the Reason, And stupifies the Conscience, which delivers Us over to an insensibilitie Of our misdeeds, and of our selves: just Heaven! Afford me light to see I am misled: But let it not as lightning blast mine eyes, Confound my Senses, make me further stray, For ever coming back to know my way. Hor. How fares your Majesty? Kin. O Horatio! shee's lost, shee's lost, Horatio. Hor. I would my wife were with her then: And so would any good Subject say, I think. King. What dost thou think? Hor. Marry I think (and so would any good Subject think, I think) as your Majestie thinks. King. What dost thou think of Loyaltie now? Hor. Truly I think there's now not any warrantable Loyaltie left but in Petruccio and my self. The Queen is now out of my Catalogue, and my Creed too. ScÅn. VIII. [A shout within] crying, Kill him, kill him: for Sforza, Sforza: kill him for the blood of Sforza, Sforza, &amp;c. King. What terrible, what hideous noise is this? [Within.] Kill him for Sforza, Sforza; kill him, kill him. Hor. My Loyaltie defend me! I know not what to make on't. [Enter a Captain distractedly, Sforza Disguised.] King. What art thou? speak: hadst thou the voice of Hell, Denouncing all the Furies in't, I dare yet hear thee; speak. Capt. O mighty Sir, Petruccio. King. What of Petruccio? Capt. O Petruccio! I tremble but to speak him. King. Shall I then with the Prophetique Spirit of a King Speaks of Petruccio? he is turn'd Traytor, And animates the Souldiers against me, Upon the discontent Alinda gave him Now in her Fury: is't not so? Hor. 'Tis so, 'tis so: ne'er ask him for the matter: I thought so, just, just as your Majestie thought it; And find withall, that now you have not left A Loyal heart but in Horatio's bosome, Now that Petruccio fails: I fear'd 'twould come To that: nay knew't: O hang him, hang him, False hearted villain! he was never right, And so I always told your Majesty. [Shout.] King. The cry comes neerer still: what does he mean, To bring my Army on to Massacre Me in my House? Capt. Dread Sir, vouchsafe attention: Petruccio is Loyal: 'tis his Loyaltie, And most sincere obedience to your will, That brings him to the ruine of his life, Unless your aweful Presence make prevention. King. Is then his Loyaltie become his danger? Capt. As thus great Sir, in the late Execution Of Death-doom'd Sforza, which the Souldier (Not looking on your Justice, but the Feud That was betwixt Petruccio and him) Resents as if it were Petruccio's Act, Not yours, that cut him off: and still, as madly Bewitch'd with Sforza's love, as ignorant Of the desert of brave Petruccio, They all turn head upon him: and as if 'Twere in his power to new create him to them, They cry to him for Sforza, Sforza; or if not, Petruccio's life must answer Sforza's blood. King. Left you him in that distress? Capt. He did prevail With much entreatie, by some private reasons, Upon their fury for an hours respite: In which dear time 'tis onely you may save Guiltless Petruccio from a timeless Grave. King. Thou art a Souldier, art not? Capt. And have commanded in your Highnesse Wars. King. Me thinks I should remember, but Ile trust thee. Hor. I hope you'll be advis'd, though, how you run Into this wild-fire of Rebellion. King. My Fortune is more desperate then his: I am beset and circled in with mischiefes. Way-laid with heaps of dangers every where: Yet I will on: Kings were not made to fear. Ile fetch him off, and the more readily, For my misprision of his Loyaltie. Could I think that man false? Hor. No Sir, nor I: By all meanes fetch him off: that Loyal General Is tenfold worth the whole Rebellious Army: Save him, and hang them all. Enter Petruccio with a Rabble of Souldiers, and two Captains, crying, Come, come, away with him, away with him. Petr. Have you no Faith, nor due obedience Unto the King? this outrage is 'gainst him, In me he suffers. 1. Capt. We obey the King, And 'tis his Justice that we cut your throat, For doing such outrage in the death of our brave General, That had you lives more then false drops of blood, They were not all sufficient satisfaction for his losse. 2. Capt. Your limited hour draws on apace: Prepare. Enter a Servant. Petr. He's come within that hour, that shall relieve me. Where is he? is he come? Serv. You are betray'd: He's fled and gone: no such man to be found. Petr. Then Faith is fled from man: is Sforza fled? Why should I wish to live, now Honour's dead? Now take your bloody course, and in my fall, Martyr the man that sav'd your General. 1. Capt. Sav'd him? how sav'd? Petr. Sforza lives. All. How's that? how's that? that, that again. Petr. As I now live, I set him free from Prison, Trusting unto his Honour to secure me, In which I did abuse the Kings Authoritie To th' forfeit of my life. Sold. This sounds: this sounds. 1. Capt. But does this sound well from a Souldiers mouth? 2. Capt. He is not now worthy of death, before He be well whipt for lying. [Within] The King, the King, the King! 1. Capt. He could never come in a better time, to see how bravely we will do justice for him. King. How comes this Fury rais'd amongst ye Souldiers? Have you forgot my Laws and Person too? 1. Capt. We honour both thus low: now give us leave To look like men, and give your Highness welcome To see a General of your Election Die with a lie in's mouth: your Souldier here, None of the good Queens old ones. King. Dare you both judge and execute this man? 2. Capt. We dare to kill the Hangman of our General, And think it fits our Office best: though you Have Law enough to wave our care and pain, And hang him up your self: for he affirms That he let Sforza live 'gainst your command; And that's the lie we treat of. Kin. Ile give you all your Pardons, and him Honour, To make that true. Sfor. Your Kingly word is taken. [Discovers himself.] Noble Petruccio, thou art disengag'd: And if the temper of the Kings high Anger Blow still above his Justice, let it crush This cloud that holds a shower of innocent blood, Willing to fall and calm his violent fury. All. Our General lives: a Sforza, Sforza. King. Sforza! Petr. You have outdone me in Nobilitie. King. I am all wonder: now this man appears The Mansion and habitual Seat of Honour; Of which he seems so full, there cannot be An Angle in his breast to lodge so base An Inmate as disloyaltie: if so, How was Eulalia false? or how Gonzago, That tender Boy, the fruit of lawless lust? There I am lost again: Great Power, that knowest The subtletie of hearts, shew me some light Through these Cymmerian mists of doubts and fears, In which I am perplex'd even to distraction: Shew me, shew me yet the face of glorious Truth; where I may read If I have err'd, which way I was misled. Hor. Enters. O my dread Lord! King. Thy news? Hor. O my sweet Soveraign! King. Art thou distracted too? Hor. No Sir: The Queen, the Queen, the Queen's distracted, And I am like to be, and you, and any man That loves the King, unless some Conjurer Be found to lay the Devil: I mean Sforza. Sforza Sir (would you think?) that monstruous Traytor Sforza walks in the Court without a Head; Appear'd unto the Queen: I found her talking with him, Kneeling and praying him to give her Pardon; Told him indeed 'twas she that sought his Head, And that she thought, that being now a Queen, She might by her Prerogative take Heads, Whose and as many as she listed: but She promis'd she would send it him again, Or else Petruccio's first: or if he would forgive her This time, shee'ld do so no more. He seem'd he would not hear her: then she beat Her self against the walls and floor, and flies To free her self by th' windows: calls for Poison, Knife, Rope, or any thing, whereby to follow Her most abused Father. What to make on't, As I am true to th' Crown, I must refer Onely unto your Majestie. King. O 'tis fearful! Petr. My Lord, you saw not th' Apparition, did you? Hor. Not I: I saw him not: nor has the Devil Power in a Traytors shadow to appear Unto a Loyal Subject. Hah! my Loyaltie And Truth unto the Crown defend me! See the very foresaid Devil at my Elbowe, Head and all now: avoid, attempt me not Satan, I do conjure thee by all the vertues of a Loyal Courtier. Sfor. They are all too weak to charm a Devil Sir; But me they may, your Friend. Hor. I defie thee Bubsebel. Petr. What do you see, my Lord? Hor. Look there, the Apparition, there it is; As like the Traytor Sforza when he liv'd, As Devil can be like a Devilâoh! Petr. Fear not: he lives, and Loyal to the King. Hor. Does the King say so? Sfor. Give me your hand my Lord, The king will say so, if this be flesh and blood. Hor. I, if thou beest flesh and blood: but how to believe that I know not, when my touch makes me sweat out a whole showre of pure Loyaltie. King. No more, Horatio: I find that my credulitie Has been wrought on unto my much abuse, And Sforza now appears an honest man. Hor. Who ever thought otherwise? or how Could he in nature appear less then Loyal? O my right noble Lord, I weep thy welcome. King. Back Souldiers, to your dutie: learn of me Hereafter how to judge with equitie. Sould. Long live the King. Exeunt Capt. and Souldiers. King. Now in the midst of my soul-frighting objects, I cannot but applaud your mutual Friendship. Hor. Yes, and how equally I affect them both. King. O that mischance propitiously might be A light to reconcile my thoughts and me. Sfor. May you be pleas'd Sir then to let the cause In which your injur'd Queen, your Son and I, And truth it self have suffered, be review'd? The mischievous creature that was drunk, now's mad With brain-confounding strong Ambition: She whom your ill-plac'd love Grac'd as a wife, Whom now I am not fond of to call Daughter, It seems is past Examination. Hor. Mad, mad, most irrecoverably mad. Sfor. But let those Hell-bred witnesses be call'd, And re-examined. Hor. They are not to be found. King. No? where is Flavello? Petr. Not seen in Court these ten dayes. Hor. Let me out-squeeze that Court-Sponge. If I do not fetch out the poisonous corruption Of all this Practice, let me yet be guiltie. ScÅn. IX. Post-Horn. Enter Pedro. Letters. King. From whence art thou? Pedr. Your Province of Palermo Thus low submits in dutie to your Highness, The Service and the lives of whose Inhabitants So truely are subjected to your Power, That needless is the Preparation Which with much grief we hear you make against us, By hostile Force to root up a Rebellion Bred meerly out of Rumour. King. Peace, no more: I find the Province Loyal. Hor. VVho made doubt on't? Ile undertake to find more Toads in Ireland, Then Rebels in Palermo, were the Queen (Queen did I call her?) that disloyal woman And that slie Traytor Lodovico out on't. King. See Sforza, see Petruccio, what Lodovico That trustie and true-hearted Lord has wrote me: He has ended all my doubts, good man. Hor. Ah, ah! does not your grace come to me now? I thought I would put your Highness to't for once, To try what you would say: when Lodovico Does not prove trustie, then let me be trus'd. Petr. 'Tis a most happy Information. King. I, do you note the Passages? Sfor. 'Tis indeed worthy a Kings regard: you see your way. King. Yes, yes, I know now what to do, And mean to put it presently in Act. Hor. This I foresaw would prove an hour of comfort. The Stars themselves ne'er saw events more plainly. King. How full of April-changes in our life? Now a fit showre of sad distilling Rain, And by and by the Sun breaks forth again. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. ScÅn. I. Enter Lodovico, Eulalia. Lod. Fear not good Madam, trust my care and Reason. Eul. Good Lodovico, though I thank your care And love to me, yet give me leave to doubt, That as that cruel and Ambitious woman Hath oversway'd the Judgement of the King, She may pervert his Royal purposes Of Peace and love, to your and my destruction. Before you sent, would you had tane my Counsel. Enter Pedro with Gonzago, and Letters. Lod. To end all doubts, see Pedro is return'd. Pedr. And happily: see Madam. [Presents Gonzago to her.] Eul. My Gonzago; My Prince, I should have said. Gonz. Thrice-gracious Mother, I thank Petruccio, who preserv'd my life, For nothing more, then this one minutes Bliss, In which I find your Blessing in a kiss. Eul. Weep not, fair Sir. Pedr. The Lord Petruccio Madam Presents you these. [Letters. She Reads.] Lod. Welcome my sweet young Prince. Gonz. I thank you Lodovico. Lod. Now I see methinks a Court again. Pedr. We shall do shortly; for the King is coming, And not in terror, but with Grace and Favour. Lod. 'Tis happy Heavenly news. Eul. See here's an Inundation Of Joys that do like waves orecome each other. Brave, wise, and valiant Petruccio! That couldst so happily deceive the King By a supposed death, to save the Life Of my sweet Boy: all that I can be sorry for, Is this: Alinda is Frantick. [Lod. reads] Pedr. Can that grieve you? Eul. He brings her with him: and I hope the change Of Air, with wholsome Prayers and Physicks Art, In which I am not ignorant, may restore her. Lod. Madam, the Sun shines fairly. ScÅn. II. Enter Lollio and Poggio. Lol. News, news upon news! Eul. The Queen is kill'd: is not that it? Lol. No nor the King neither, God bless him: they are both alive, with all their Pomp and Train coming to see our School-Mistress. Eul. Auspicious Providence! Lol. They take us in their way, for they are passing to Nicosia, where the King means to keep his word with the Queen, in giving her three what d'ye calls? Lod. Three Boons, as the custom is. Lol. Boons? I Boons: I warrant she'l ask no Baubles. Pog. O Mistress, you were careful for her, that comes I warrant but to jeere you. Eul. Patience would die, if 'twere not exercis'd. But now it rests, that we prepare to entertain our Guests. We must to welcome them make Holy day, And give our Scholars leave to Feast and Play. The Swaines you say are perfect in the Dance; So are my Maids: wee'l leave it for the King. Exeunt. ScÅn. III. Enter King, Alinda, Horatio, Lodovico, Attendants. King. I cannot but applaud your mind, Alinda, But am not much affected with the Subject On which you purpose now to cast your Favour. Lod. More scorn upon my life, and rude vexation. [aside] Alin. If my fair meaning Sir shall prove mistaken, 'Tis but a loving purpose lost. (O that wretch Flavello!) [aside] Lod. If she have further purpose then to raise More sorrow by the Kings displeasure to her. [aside] Hor. Let her alone, her Raign's but short we know. [aside] Soft Musick. Hor. Is this the sound of want and misery? Alin. Of wantonness I fear, and Luxurie. (The villain had no purpose but to flatter.) [aside] O Sir, why came we hither? Lod. Mark the Camelion. [aside] King. 'Tis most sweet Musick. ScÅn. IV. Enter Eulalia with three or four Girls, and work in their hands. Eul. Such as the rudeness of the Countrey yields Sir, Hayl to the King and Queen, and may the thanks Which on my knees I offer at those Feet That beautifie and bless this humble Earth Add many years unto your happy lives. Alin. We have e'en seen enough: 'twas all I fear'd, To find her knee-deep in Hypocrisie. Eul. Seem not to turn away, most gracious Madam, Before I shew for which I hop'd you came, The manner how I get a competence to live. [Shews her works, and makes a brave description of Pieces: As Sale-work, Day-work, Night-work, wrought Night-caps, Coyfs, Stomachers.] Alin. Your work you say, though't be o'th' newest Frame, I fear your Play is still at the old Game. Both wayes bring money: is't not so forsooth? King. Enough, Alinda. Lod. Too much, to tread upon Affliction. [aside] King, What say you Lodovico? Lod. I say Sir, the distresses of that Lady merit a Kings Pity, and not such scorn As I see cast upon her: but the best are women. King. No more. Eul. May it please your Highness sit, and note the Play By which we gain when we lay work away. The Song I taught you last. Song. Alin. These wenches will be a good help to you at wassel-tide. Eul. We have varietie for all the Seasons, Of such poor entertainments, mighty Queen, To shew our much contentment in their welcome. Lod. Goodness speaks in her. Alin. There's for your Song () No, stay, I may transgress The Law. (Lod. O Devil! Hor. Let her jeer on.) [aside] King. Not if you give it for her pains, Alinda. Alin. Nay since you warrant it, let's pay and go. Though I have heard such pains disputed Begging. Lod. As all Arts are, by the Rewards they find. Eul. Nay I beseech your Majesties. Alin. What's the Feat now? [Musick, Dance.] Alin. Sir, are you pleas'd to prosecute your journey? Or do these Beauties and delights enchant you? King. Ha? no, come, let's away. Eul. Oh let me yet entreat your Highness stay. Alin. Not a stroke more I thank you: we have heard And seen enough: so much, as I must tell you I cannot but commend your Parents Wisdom, Who having Calculated your Nativitie, By which they had the foresight of your fall, Prevented thus the Planets by their care, By teaching you to live by Hand and Foot. Lod. Did ever Daughter of a King thus suffer? Or has she Pride to smile on Injuries? Alind. Sir, you forget Nicosia. [Eulalia whispers her.] Alin. Plots against me? King. How's that? Alin. She dreams of Treason intended against me. Hor. No Divination against her own good, I hope. [aside] Eul. Mighty Sir, hear me: not to implore your Bountie; No not your thanks, nor Popular Applause; But for I am your Subject and your servant, Bound by your Allegiance as well to prevent All Ills might pass against you, as to do none. I could not think it but strict dutie in me To hasten this discoverie. Lod. Treason, and a Letter? We have never a false Brother amongst us, have we? Hor. If ever you held your peace, peace now. King. It bears a face of Horror. Alin. Cunning and Gipsie Tricks: will you to Nicosia? Kin. What we meant there, we may do here as well. The Treason's there intended: look ye my Lords! How careless is this woman of her safetie. Alin. You Sir are careless: for if there be danger, VVhere can I fear it but in this place onely? The world holds not an Enemy of mine, But this enchantress you maintain against me. King. Your motion and your own love drew us hither. Alin. I would fain love her, and certainly I should, But that she still begets fresh cause of Hatred. She has some Devillish Plot in hand this Instant: This shew is but the straw that hides the Pit. Lod. No enemy but she? to let her know she lies, Even unto Prophanation against that Lady, Ile speak. Hor. I hope you will not. Lod. The King shall see his error. Hor. Will you? Lod. She her crueltie. Hor. Will you, will you? Lod. The world Eulalia's Pietie. Hor. Will you? will you? King. What says Lodovico? Lod. Most mighty Sir, we here confess and say. Hor. We? you hear not me say any thing; do you? King. What will you say? Lod. That Letter was not ours. Hor. That's well. King. We easily believe it. Lod. Nor any day or place as yet set down Among our selves, for fact against the Queen. I mean Alinda. Hor. Nor fact intended was there, of death or danger? Lod. 'Twas wish'd at least by us. Hor. Lord, Lord, Lord mumb. King. Our Guard. [Enter Guard] Lod. King she's the General grudge of all thy Kingdom. Hor. You do not hear me say so. King. Their grudge incites my love: take e'm away. Come my wrong'd Alinda: This place shall serve, And this Assembly, to make a Kings word good. Make your Demands: three things I promise you. Ask what you will, even to my dearest blood. Alin. Your Highness will excuse me, if I urge you To bind it with an Oath? King. Give me a Book. VVhat I have promis'd to my lawful Queen, I will perform; ask freely. Eul. Great Queen, vouchsafe to take an Admonition, My last and truest Testimonie of Love. The rest were shadows to it. Alin. Well, pray let's hear it. Eul. Let your Demands be for the common good. Not for your own respects: selflove may hurt you: Beware Ambition, Envie, and Revenge. King. The Oracle could not pronounce more wisely. Alin. Is this your love? 'tis fear of my just Vengeance. Therefore hear my demands, my King and Husband. First I demand the lives of these conspirators Lodovico and Horatio. Omn. Bloody. Alin. Next that your Son, much of the Mothers Nature, By Act of Parliament be disinherited. Omn. O fearful. Alin. Last, that this woman have her eyes put out, And be for ever banish'd your Dominions. Omn. Crueltie and Ingratitude past all Example King. Was this your Charitie? you have now declar'd it fully: And I of both have made sufficient Tryal. Come here Eulalia, take now thy wonted Seat and keep it ever. Thy povertie and patience have restor'd thee By the just Providentce: while her Excesse and Pride Casts her before thee, to receive that Doom She had devis'd 'gainst thy immortal Goodness. Into perpetual Exile; hence, away with her. Alind. Remember your Oath, my Lord. King. My Oath was to perform what I had promis'd unto my lawful Queen: that's my Eulalia. And let good Lodowick and Horatio be restor'd. Exeunt King and Attendants Alinda entransed carried out. ScÅn. V. Enter Curate. Cur. Oh! proh! proh Nef as! O Ile have no hand in blood of any man. Eul. More exclaimations? what distracts you now? Cur. Coram Senatu res acta est: sub Judice lis est. OcurvÃ¦ in Terris animÃ¦: the Rusticks Have tane again the Law into their hands. And will you tender clemencie non justante A Courtiet hang, his sweet Face nec invante. Eul. VVhat is his Name? Cur. His Name is hight Alphonso That Treason brought in Pectore &amp; Skonso Eul. VVho are the heads of the Judicious Faction? Cur. Andrea, Lollio, Poggio, the Drudges Have got the Peoples voice to be their Judges. Lod. Dare they do this? Cur. Yes Judges they will be, And kill, they say, the Snake of Treachery. Eul. I hope we may come yet to stay their Sentence. Pray bring us to the place: where if we can, Let us avert their Judgement from this man. Exeunt. ScÅn. VI. Enter Andrea, Poggio, Lollio, a Typst aff before them. Andr. And can these turmoiles never have an end? Unless we load our heads and shoulders thus Our bodies eke with Justice Capa Pe. And Pepper all our brains with Policie. Pog. 'Twas time to have a care: I, and a piteous care. Lol. A pious care you mean. Pog. Well pious then: You'l shew your own wit, whose clothes soever you wear (So do the wits of the time) but as I said, 'Tis time we have a care, for though our Queen, Our School Mistress I would say, be mercifully, idleful It is fit that we be prejudicious in the State. Lol. Ju-dicious Brother. Pog. Jew in your face. Trip me again? Andr. Agree upon't, Brother Sages of the Bench. My Brother Poggio here said very well And learnedly and as I would have said my self? (If you will take his meaning) to wit that as Our Shool Mistris doats upon Clemencie, it is fit that we run mad upon crueltie So meeting her in the midst, we shall jump into the Sadle of Justice. Pog. I do say so, without all peradventure For if the Candle of her mercy be not put out, VVe shall shortly, see more honest men then Knaves among us. Lol. More Knaves you mean Brother. Pog. I mean no more Knaves then your self, Brother. Andr. Agree again, Sage brothers of the Bench: and let no private Itch grow to a publike Scab. Lol. Then the point: Do not I understand the purpose of our meeting Here in our pettie Parliament, if I may so call it? Is it not for a Reformation, to pull down The Queens mercy, and set up our Justice? For the prevention of a superabundance of Treason Dayly practiced against her? Andr. Most true. And is it fit therefore that you brabble among your selves, and leave all worse then you found it? Lol. No, we will make such a Reformation, that Treason shall not dare to peep over the Hedge of her Dominion, but we will take it by the nose and punish it indignely: most indignely will we punish it? Pog. All this I grant: but before we sit and bustle on the Bench, because it is, and that without all peradventure, the strst time that ever we play'd so wise a part, is it not fit to take advice among our selves, how to deform our selves in our office. Lol. De did you say? in in you should say. Pog. In with your Horns: how now? Andr. Nay Brothers o'th Bench. Pog. Does he think to control me? because he has been a Sexton, and a little more book learned then a Lay man with an Amen forsooth? Andr. Nay Brothers: this wil control the business. Pog. Or because he has been in many a mans grave before him, does he think no man so deep in grave matters as himself? Lol. Well, I forbear. Pog. Shall he bid me In, In? as if I were not his inferior? Lol. I forbear still. Pog. I will shew my self his inferior I, and a greater man then he; and to prove my self a great man, let him hang one, I will save two. Lol. Still forbear. Andr. Pray Brothers yet agree: and remember we use no mercy Pog. Let him that uses any mercy lack mercy, for my part. Lol. Then let us sit, and fall to the Business. Pog. Sit and fall: was that so wisely spoken of a book-learned man now? Lol. Still I forbear Passion becomes not Judges, Now bring in the offender, the new and last offender. And. Pray thinke on your speeches. [Exit Typstaff.] Lol. I have made speeches that I hope shall make Traytors. And. How? Lol. Asham'd to wear their own heads on their shoulders. Andr. A Traytors head is not his own head: 'tis forfeited by Law to the King; 'tis the Kings head. Pog. I say a Traytors head is his own Head: and a good Subjects head is the Kings Head. Lol. I say that's Treason: and the head thou wearest is not thine own then, if thou beest a good Subject. Pog. Wilt thou tell me that? Andr. Passion becomes not Judges, Brothers o'th the Bench. The offender comes, Now they are hot, he shall be sure to smoak for it. ScÅn. VII. Enter Alphonso and Guard. Alph. Whither do you hale me? you Pease-porridge Peasants: Is this a place for me to come to Tryal in? If I had broke the Law, as I have not I am a Peer, and do appeal unto The Kings high Seat of Justice, publikely. Lol. And will not our low stool of Justice, privily Serve for a Traytor? ha. Alph. Your selves are Traytors, In succouring 'gainst the Law, a dissolute woman Whom I command you, in the Kings high name, To yield into my hands. Lol., Pog., Andr. You shall be hang'd first. Alph. By whose Authority? Lol. By the said womans Sir. She is our Queen and her Authority is in our hands. Alph. That speaks you Traytors: and the King has Law against you and her. Lol. When you are hang'd he has: to the next able Tree with him, and hang him presently. Alph. Villains: you dare not so say. Omn. We do all say Hang him with one accord: Gua. If one cord will not do't another shall: So come away Sir. Lol. Stay: hear a speech first. Alph. You dare not use me thus: dare you take Justice on ye? Lol. Yes Sir, we can spie Great faults in Noble Coats, with half an eye. What though we nod? does Treason therefore think Justice is adle brain'd? or though she wink In us (as thus) that she's a sleep? or say She take a nap, d' ye think shee'l sleep for ay? No, she but dreams a while, to circumvent, Your vains hopes, with sharper punishment. For if she be but jogg'd, no Mastife takes Swifter or surer vengeance when she wakes. Pog. I, hang him, hang him. Andr. Is he not hang'd yet? Pog. Without all peradventure the Hangman means to hang for him. Guard. Come Sir along, never hang backward, for up you must. Lol. Stay him, my speeches will be lost else. Pog. Your long speeches will loose our purpose again, without all peradventure. Alph. Must I be mock'd out of my life? and have My death by hanging made a sport to Peasants, In this blind hole oth' Kingdom? Andr. Why thou choplogicall Fellow, dost thou not think, there are as good men hang'd, and as good sport made of it too, in the bli[illeg.] holes of the Kingdom, as in the very eye or open mouth of it? ha! Pog. Away with him without peradventure Alph. I am a Courtier, and servant to the King. Lot. Come all the Court in all your costly Braveries. And Treason in your Breech, we'll hang you for your Knaveries, On tree in Hempen twine nay if you come In open Arms, up shall you all and some. For though for Tournament your Fames do flie Run all at Tilt on us, wee'l draw your dry. Andr. Tell us you are a Courtier? we find here Faults to correct, which you perceive not there. So, now a way with him, I have spoke my best. Pog. And without all peradventure well said Judge Andrea: How long must we say away with him? ha! Alph. You hobnayl'd Rascals: can you think that you Are fit to spie or corrects faults at Court? Lol. Stay, a short speech for that, and turn him off. Your shoes at Court are all too fine and thin: To tread out snuffes and sparks of kindling Sin, Which let alone the Rushes may take fire. Then flame, then burn up higher still, and higher: You warm you at such fire, 'tis we walk through't The hobnayl'd Common wealth must tread it out. Andr. So, now away with him. Hang him first, d' ye hear He has the bast clothes, that will encourage The Hangman the better to turn the rest after him. Enter Eulalia, Lodovico. Eul. Whither away with him? Pog. So, now you see what's become of your fine speeches. Eul. Will ye, 'gainst all my Counsels and requests Persist to pull destruction by taking others lives upon your own? And seem to carry it as in care for me? Pog. No, 'tis in care of our selves, because we know Not to breed our Children honestly without you. Eul. Have I not often councell'd and entreated You would forbear? Lol. Your councels and entreats We are bound to disobey by Proclamation: For we must grant you nothing. Andr. VVell found out. Pog. And therefore if you say, Hang not this man We are bound to hang him: we will shew our selves the Kings Subjects not yours. Lod. If you can answer't to the King, 'tis well; His Majesty is here at hand. Eul. Go leave him unto me. Andr. The King at hand? 'tis time for us to look about us. Lol. Must not we be hang'd now? Pog. It will be so, without all peradventure. Eul. Release your Prisoner, set him free, and go send the rest of the confederats. Exeunt Guard Alphonso kneeles. Alph. I was not bound till now I have no power to move or stir a limb: O sacred Queen, use mercy, in adjudging me, To present death, to quit me of the torment. That rages all upon me, all within me. The sight of you has shot more paines into me Then I have drops of blood: O let me die. Eul. I cannot give thee death: nor will my prayers Be prevalent for thy cure poor sinful man! Till rhou layst ope the cause of thy disease; (Thy hainous sin) by fair and free confession. Alph. I hope no cure, and therefore ask no life. But the Kings Justice to afford me death, That is no less deserved then desir'd; For I confess, This my Device was but To make my way to you, t' have murder'd you. Enter two Lieutenants, Doctor and Midwife. Wrought thereunto by Alinda's Instigation. More I confess; The Evidence against you, Whereby you were despos'd, was false. And all these witnesses which now do bring Addition to my torment, did I hire Both for their perjury past, and for their late Attempt upon your life, with the Queens money. Eul. Do you confess it? Omn. Heaven Pardon our misdeed: it is most true. Eul. Heaven grant you all your cures. Omn. All blessings on the Queen. Eul. All was confess'd before by Fabio and Strozzo. And you do well to seem so penitent: I do forgive you: and will plead your pardon unto the King. Alph. Your sacred mercy Madam, shall save a life then, to be spent in Praises and Prayers for your Grace. Eul. Go, and pray for grace to mend your lives. [Exeunt offenders.] So, let's now to the King. Lod. Now look you about you: cast your Coats, and instantly Hast to the Curat, hee's preparing sports, In speech and Dance, to entertain the King: Go and assist him: that must be the way To gain your Pardons. Andr. Come them, let's away, No longer Brothers of the Bench wee'l be, But of the Revels for his Majesty. ScÅn. VIII. [Recorders.] Enter King, Horatio, Sforza, Petruccio. King. These troubles over: let us, now Surveigh this part of my Possession. I never saw before. I could contemplate This late neglected peece of my Estate, To be the happiest: sure it is no less, To those that think on earth there's happiness, The Air disperseth pleasure and the Earth Of fresh delight to every step gives birth. Here plentie grows, and above it content, Ore spreads the Face of all the Continent. Eulalia, thou art happy, and didst rise, Not fall from Court into this Paradise. Nor can it move my admiration much, Thy vertue wrought the change, and made it such. Sfor. My Lord, the King is sad, what shall we do? Hor. I am as sad as he, and should be dead, If he were dead: and therefore no fit member To make Him merry, I: try your vein with him, Tell him your Daughters dying; that may cheer him. Sfor. Are you so tart Court Blain-worm? King. Yet can I smile in midst of grief to think How the Court malice hath been wav'd and punished, By Rustical simplicitie. Petr. The Sun Appears again in the Kings smiles: observe. Hor. I thank your Majestie, that sweet smile reviv'd me, King. Who smil'd? Hor. not I, I'm sure did you: or you? There could be no such thing: who dares be merry, when the King's sad? Shalmes Petr. Yes, here are some now coming, I hear 'm, that are merry in hope to make the King so. ScÅn. IX. Enter Curat richly rob'd, and Crown'd with Bays, playing on a Fiddle, many School Boys with Skarfes and Nosegays, &amp;c. then follow Gonzago, dress'd and Crown'd as Queen of the Girles, following her: at last Eulalia supported by Lodovico and Andrea: Alphanso, Strozzo, Fabio. D. Midwife. The former being all pass'd over the Stage: they kneel to the King. King. O my Eulalia! Eul. Still the most humble Handmaid To your high Majestie. King. Thy words are sweet: Yet to my guiltie sense they are no less Then thunder bolts; fram'd of the wrongs I shot Against the Heavenly Region of thy mind. And 'tis but Justice that the repercussion Do strike me dead. Eul. No Passion mighty Sir, Hor. O my sweet Queen! but I am thunder struck Andr. Old Lad, art there? still sick oth' Kings disease. [aside] Eul. If I may presume of any favour, vouchsafe a glance on these. Alphonso, Stro., Fab., Doctor and Mid. Besech your Highness. Enter Curat Gonzago in his hand veil'd three or four Lasses. Cur. Thus have you seen great King in best array, Nostri Discipuli have made Holy-day, Whilst I their PÃ¦dagogue or pettie King Present in hand this little Royal Thing, Yclep'd their Queen or Mistriss: certe fallor For that's the Royal School Mistress as we call her. And this her under Usher: vey'ld is she, Dreading the Power of shinning Majesty. Might dazle her Dancing: for nunc est saltandum, And here are Lads and Lasses that at Random Have left their works, as we the School &amp; Templum, To follow us; 'tis Regis ad Exemplum. The youth's are muffled for their better graces, Though you may like their feet, youl'd blame their Faces But Ile not trouble you with long Oration, Because I had but short precogitation. [Dance] Hor. His Highness thanks you: and hath here dispos'd An hundred Duccats in this Purse inclos'd; Drink it amongst ye to the Kings well faring, And see there be no falling out ith' sharing So make your Exit. Cur. Non simus ingrati Rex &amp; Regina semper sint Beati. Exeunt Curat and Lasses. Eul. Stay you a while. Manent Fabio Strozzo Alphonso Doctor and Midwife; they all kneel. You know my Story, Sir, and who have been My strong abusers, and by me converted, Therefore let me Petition: Royal King You have by these discovered the abuse That led you into error: and that light, Which makes discovery of their black misdeeds, Will shew you to a Throne of greater mercy Then you can give. King. I must confess I need it Bee't as thou wilt Eulalia. Eul. Go then, and thank the King. All. Long live the King and Queen. [Exeunt offenders.] Lod. Here's goodness now. Hor. I would the Devil had, 'm that thought ill of her. Andr. And, good King Pardon me, and my pure brother Judges, and Sages of the Dorpe here, that would have hang'd those Manufactors. King. 'Tis quickly granted. Andr. And Ile as quickly make them run mad with Joy. Eul. My next suit is, (for now I'm set a begging, You'l Pardon your Alinda. King. She is not mine; Should she recover, as Heavens will be done. Eul. Recover? fear not, Sir, this Traunse hast drown'd Her Frenzie, and shee'l live a sober life. King. I shall forgive her, But she must no more, in her recovery: Be consort or acquaintance unto me: But where's Posteritie now? O my Boy! Eul. Sir you have had but homely entertainment Yet in my humble dwelling: now Ile shew you (Since you appear so tender and so good A Father) the sweet comfort of a Son; Pray fetch the Prince. King. You cannot raise from death. Exit Lodovico. Eul. Can you forgive Pttrucio that deceiv'd you In his faign'd death, to save a real life: King. Forgive? he won me in preserving Sforza, Let me but see my Son, Ile honour him. Enter Lodovico with Gonzrgo. Hor. See the most Princely vertue that survives. King. lives my Gonzago? Gonz. If you my Royal Father be not displeas'd With me, or my good mother, I shall live. Hor. And long live my sweet Prince. King. Let not my joy confound me! where's Petruccio? Lod. Sforza and he are bringing the entrauns'd Alinda (Your fair Queen to your presence.) King. She is no Queen of mine. Hor. No, hang her, hang her. This, this is the Queen. A very Queen of harts: a better Title Crowns not the best of women in our days. King. Good Lodovico, may the merited Fame of thy fidelitie, While there are Kings on Earth, Shew them to gratifie All trustie servants: love him Gonzago. Hor. Love him? my Loyaltie preserv'd, I shall not desire the Princes love my self If he not giv't to faithful Lodovico, My true yoak fellow in State and Commonwealth. [Recorders.] Enter Sforza and Petruccio, bringing Alinda in a Chayre, veyl'd. King. But here's the man Gonzago, whom thou owest, A love of equal value to thy life. Petr. I cannot Sir, in dutie nevertheless But fall before your mercy, which I pray for, That durst assume the hardness to control: Your Majestie Command. Hor. There is a Loyaltie after my own heart now. Here a new Song, Ealalia unvailes Alinda. Eul. Bless'd Heauen! she lives and wakes I hope in health. Sfor. If she awake to vertue, she is welcome, Into the the world again: but if she rise With an Ambitious Throught of what she was Or meet the light with a presumptuous look: That renders her in thought but worthy of it: By this bless'd presence I will yet take leave. To sink her under earth immediatly. Eul. Patience good Sforza, see what she will do. Alin. Where have I been? or how am I brought hither? Or where I am I know not: but that shall not. [Musick ceased.] Be unto me a wonder: for I know Were it reveil'd, it could not be so strange: A storie as my self was to the world. How have I, wandred in the way of Error! Till I was worn into an Airie vapour. Then wrap'd into a cloud: and thence distill'd, Into the earth to find a new creation. 'Tis found: and I am found in better state, Then I was in, before I lost my Dutie. For in this second Birth: I find a knowledge How to preserve it: Therefore if an Heart Dissolved in its Tears may move your Pity My noble Father, (if I may say Father,) Whose blessing and forgiveness I entreat, Let not your frown destroy my future hopes. Sfor. What a rich sound were this now, were it reall! Eul. As you may think I honour vertue Sforza, I do believe 'tis really unfaigned. Sfor. It is Heavens goodness to your Grace then Madam. The more to vindicate your iniur'd vertue. And manifest your merits to the world, Thou art mine own again Alinda. Eul. Nore her further. Alin. My suit is next to you King, Queen, and Prince, Whose love, whose Pietie, whose Innocence, I have too much abus'd: that to appeal, My trespasses at large by due confession. I should appear but more impertinent to each eye and ear. My suit is therefore (though you not forget I ever was) you will be pleas'd to think, There is not an Alinda in the world. So give me leave to leave it: and in this, I beg my Fathers Aid, to be remov'd Back to my countrey Naples; and in that, Into the Magdalene Nunnerie at Lucera, To spend this life in Tears for my amiss, And holy Prayers for eternal Bliss. [veiles her self.] Sfor. So thou art mine for ever. King. She has anticipated my great purpose, For on the reconcilement of this difference, I vow'd my after life unto the Monasterie Of holy Augustinians at Solanto. Omn. O mighty Sir! King. 'Tis not to be gainsaid. So hast we to Nicosia, where (my Son) In lieu of former wrongs, Ile yield thee up my Crown and Kingdom. Your vertuous mother (whom may you for ever Honour for her pietie) with these true Statesmen, will enable you to govern well. Hor. Who makes a doubt of that? King. And let your studie, Sir, be ever watchful To cherish vertue, as to punish vice. And see that you considerative be Of Sforza, in the wrongs he felt by me. His was the greatest losse. Sfor. Sir, I have won: My wrongs are drown'd in her conversion. King. Good Sforza, see her plac'd as she desires, In that Religious order. I have now Plighted my Troth to Heaven, and so has she. Omn. O may (Sir) such Wedlock ne'er broken be. King. Now with such melting silence as sweet Souls From Bodies part to Immortalitie, May we for better life divided be. Exeunt Omnes.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The first Song, for pag. 88. VVhat if a Day, or a moneth, or a year Crown thy Delights With a thousand, wish'd contentings? May not the chance of a Night or an Hour Cross thy Delights With as many sad Tormentings? Fortune, Honour, Beautie, Birth, Are but blossomes dying. Wanton Pleasures, doating Mirth, Are but Shadows flying. All our Joys Are but Toys, Idle thoughts deceiving: None hath power Of an Hour In our lifes bereaving.</field>

How bless'd are they that wast their wearied Hours In solemn Groves, and solitarie Bowers, Where neither eye nor Ear Can see or hear The frantique mirth And false Delights of frolique earth: Where they may sit and pant, And breath their pursy Souls; Where neither grief consumes, nor griping want. Afflicts; nor sullen care controuls. Away false Joys, ye Murther where ye kisse. There is no Heaven to that, no Life to this.</field>
