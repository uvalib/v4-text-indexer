      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Outside the apse of an old chapel, at either end, is a tomb, one of chalcedony and one of beryl. From the beryl tomb a rose-tree has broken forth: it makes an arch of red blossoms across the apse and plunges its strong shoots into the tomb of chalcedony. Under the arch Amor is standing with reversed torch, and in his other hand a goblet, hung with seaweeds and tarnished. Amor. Up from the sea-depths I have brought This my cup in which was wrought My spell long years afar— Years that now are, O Underground, thy own, And lie beneath thy throne. Venus came forth from out the sea, Darkness and immensity: Down thither have I dived, From the gulf rived This goblet hung with seeds, The soundless sea-wrack breeds. And I have brought it to thee, Death, Up from the deep where Love's breath First had desire and rose: O thou, deep Close Of Love's mortality, A gift of love—to thee! Lo, this encrusted thing I hold Is full of wine, new and bold As these red roses' tide, That spreads them wide! On thy old tombs I pour From out my relic hoar. [He makes libation on the tomb of beryl and the tomb of chalcedony. Then he lifts his torch. There is no rose in the world like the rose-tree of Tintagel, The rose that leapt and fell From a lover's tomb; Its thorn and leaves and bloom Dreaming a goal and stirred To flight as an autumn bird, With a track to learn, With a space to burn, And the air to travel, Till in her bed of gloom The loved is straightly caught from the tomb, Wherever the plunging rose finds room. This rose will not fail of his goal; He has power To push through the tower Where the bells toll: This rose is swept along by the power Of his fragrance as by a soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene The Hall of the Castle of Tintagel. King Mark and Queen Yseult la Belle sit side by side on their thrones. Brangaena sits on the steps of the Queen's throne. The feast is over; the Cornish Nobles still sit at the long tables. A Bard with oak-wreath and a great harp recoils before the forbidding hand of Yseult, who, with drooped head, yet silences his lay. King Mark. You will not listen? Autumn evening-tide Is pensive for its music—very heavy At heart are autumn evenings. Will you not listen? Yseult. No! [There is a long silence. . . . Let autumn rouse to winter! What have songs To do with the unleasing branches? Rouse The jest! Light up, light up! Bring in a fool! Mark. Ah, to be adverse to your will for ever! I cannot give command For Triolet to come; I cannot say to the grave, Make mirth, restore Our Triolet of France to ring his bells, And draw his flock behind him, wheresoever His tinkle find its pasture. Triolet Is gone! Will you not listen? Yseult. No! Mark. Then bring the chess-boards! (To Yseult.) I will win our game. Cries. Chess-boards! Ay, ay, the royal game! Yseult. Your king— Can I check him, can I ever check your king? Mark. Lights, and the board! [They begin to play. Duke Audret enters. There is silence, and the sound of the pieces as they are moved. After a while the King laughs. Your knight is gone! [The Queen plays on languidly. After making one of her moves, she clasps her head with her arms and yawns. Then with sudden and sharp animation she makes another move. Yseult. Check to your king, my King! Mark. This castle, ah, this castle ... Were you blind? Lord of Tintagel, to my aid Another magic castle sweeps—safe, safe! [Yseult again clasps her head round with her arms and yawns. Brangaena rises and listens. The squires outside are noisy. Yseult. 'Tis some beggar, Or some wild creature in their midst. Ha, ha! Your cruel squires . . . But these are merry games, Where there are shouts! Cries. Hue! hue! Whoop, whoop! Hue, hue! Yseult (rising). Brangaena, listen, A hue and cry! Whoop, whoop! Mark. It spoils the game. Reprove them, Audret. Yseult. Hark— The sound of little bells that ride aloft, Like bubbles on a cataract. Cries. Whoop, whoop! Fool . . . Rap his ears— His pate! Whip him—and soundly! The bladder-skin, beat out his squeals. Hoy, hoy! Whoop! whoop! The clown, the ugly clown! The gipsy! The solemn otter! Ha, ha, ha! [A Fool, fighting his way among blows and jeers, is precipitated into the hall. The Fool. Protection! Mark. Of the king's sceptre, since the jester's cannot Subdue the people? (To Yseult.) Here is company, Here your desire. Now will the evening speed As Christmas-time . . . More lights about the Queen! Cheer, cheer! A carpet for the fool! A cloak! His rags will shame us. Dignity must wait On such portentous wrinkles . . . Not even ocean Digs brown sand in such curves. Yseult. Ha, ha, I never Beheld a thing so laughable. Ha, ha! He fixes me! Audret. With otter eyes. Yseult. An otter, A hunted, old dog-otter! Ha, ha, ha! Brangaena, this great fool is worth a thousand Of little Monsieur Triolet de France . . . Eyes—but these hunted things have eyes indeed! Mark. Friend, you are welcome! The Fool. Sire, Noble and good among all kings of earth, My heart melts with its tenderness Alas, My folly! Can I run away from tears . . . Or can I fly my folly? [He lays his face on his arm and weeps. With a sudden convulsive movement his bells tinkle; as if warned, he gets up and makes obeisance. God protect you, Good Sire of Cornwall! God protect you, lady! Mark. Friend, tell us what should bring you to Tintagel? Truth, fool! Fool. Yseult the Queen! Yseult. I—for this hair's sake? [She holds out a glittering fold of her tresses. Fool. Gold of the sun, for that— Lords, all must know How I have loved the Queen. [Close to Mark, and making the gestures with his hands of one who bargains. I have a sister, A beautiful, dark sister, cloaked and hooded In raven hair—wild sloes her blackest eyes, And love a bloom, a dimness on them—love For Mark the King of Cornwall. She is named Brunhilda, she is dark and beautiful. This golden queen has dazzled you and wearied; But my Burgundian sister I will barter For your Yseult, out of pure love and duty. Swift! Make exchange! Yseult. Close with his bargain, Sire! Take Brunhild, give Yseult to the brown fool, That she may count his wrinkles in a month, And his grimaces in a whole year's time. Wife of a Fool—my part! [She laughs. The Fool advances with outstretched hand. Mark (laughing bitterly). And if I give her, What would you do with her, where take her, Fool? The Fool. Yonder between the zenith and the clouds— They for her floor, the blue height for her roof— In that large space through which the sun takes air, As in his garden and own solitude, Where are no winds to make their quarrel, thither I will lead up the Queen, and ask the sun Gift of a crystal chamber, walled with roses In tapestry of summer, full of light, When Dawn plays on the crystal and the roses The music of her freshness. Mark. My royal lady, No singing of my minstrels charmed your ear— So for your punishment a fool turns poet; And you must hear who clamoured for a fool. Yseult. Brangaena, in the fields of Ireland often We saw that country. Brangaena. O sweet Queen, a country We found when the tall grass had buried us In spires and clover . . . ah! Mark. The prattling jester, He loves his words and decks them bravely out. Cries. Oh, a good fool! Dwell with us at Tintagel! Mark. Friend, what assurance have you that my lady Will follow you up yonder? You are wizen And hideous . . . (To the Courtiers.) Look, what see you to commend? Yseult. His eyes—he plucked them from some sad, wild creature Under writhed forest-bark. . . . [The Fool comes close to her impulsively. Brangaena. Fool, even by your eyes, Why should my lady follow? The Fool. Why? Because I have accomplished for her sake Many a labour, many a deed of glory, Many a deed of daring, and for her I have become a fool . . . for her am mad . . . A fool! Mark. Who art thou? The Fool. Tristan, I am Tristan, He who so loved the Queen, who loves her yet, Who will not cease to love when breath has ceased. You know, you all must know that I am Tristan! [He leads the laugh that runs round the hall. Mark joins in it, glancing wrathfully at Yseult, who gives one sigh, as if a viol had been struck; then, flushing with wrath, starts to her feet. Yseult. Go, wretched fool, creature of evil, go! Who brought him in? Out from my presence—Mark, Out from your presence send him. Mark. Softly, Queen! You cried aloud for jests—this is the jest. Now be you merry as at Christmastide! Deny not to the fool his privilege To tongue whatever folly lifts the heart By laughter and derision into ease. With fools we play the fool. The Fool. Do you remember, How, dying of the venom that I took From Morhout's sword, I landed on your shore, Faint, with my harp, and how you healed my anguish, And healed me into health? . . . Do you remember, Queen? Yseult. Hunt him away—out from my sight with him! [The Fool chases the Nobles and Squires to the door. The Fool. Out of my sight! Dolts, wiseacres, leave me to use my hour With Queen Yseult. I am come to love the Queen. Grant me her privacy. [The King laughs. Yseult, red with deeper wrath, stamps her foot. Yseult. Sire, hunt him out, As he was hunted in. Let him be lashed and torn. Mark. Softly—a woman must not blench from light Of drollery and wit. The Fool (more passionately). O Queen Yseult, Do you remember, when you laid the splinter, You found in Morhout's skull—your kinsman's skull— Against my mutilated sword, and lo, It fitted close and you beheld me Tristan, And raised my sword to kill, but did not kill me? I was a wondrous knight! Do you remember, Queen? Yseult. Cursed be the mariners of Cornwall, cursed, Who brought you to this shore and did not throw you To the rolling quiet of mid-sea. My curse! [The whole room is gathered round with strenuous attention, broken every now and then by a malicious laugh. The Fool. Do you remember, Queen? . . . [Yseult descends the steps of the Throne, taking Brangaena's hand. Yseult. Teller of tales, What is there to remember in vain dreams? In prattle of delusion? Yesternight You drank too deep—and it is drunkenness That spins for us these tales. The Fool (with more passionate accents). True! I am drunk, And of such draught, that never of its frenzy My heart-throbs will be stayed. O Queen Yseult, Do you forget that noon on the mid-sea, That mid-May noon, so warm and beautiful, When you were thirsty? Daughter of a King, Do you forget? We drank from the same cup; We drank, and ever has the fatal glory Astounded me, as planet-struck. O Queen, Do you not yet remember —what we drank? [Yseult has been leaning on Brangaena and gazing at the Fool with wide, terrified eyes. At his last appeal she hides her head in her mantle and breaks from Brangaena. But the King, holding her ermine cloak, draws her back and seats her again at his side. Mark. Wait, wait, a little, fair, impatient one! We will set fooling to another tune; Or where is our festivity, where Christmas, Where is the red-lit winter? Fool, your art, Your trade? The Fool. To serve great kings. Mark. And can you hunt With dogs and with gyr-falcons? Fool. As I will! With traps I capture swans and geese and doves Of the wild-wood; with harriers in the cloud I run the cranes and herons. [All laugh. Mark. When you fish What do you draw out of the freshets, brother? The Fool. Wolves of the night, great wood-bears; and my falcons Drop goats before me, foxes and specked does; My hawks run hares to ground: and I can brew Herb-broths, and tune the harp and sing in tune. I can love queens—defend myself, with staff, As you have seen to-day, and tell you tales. Heigh for my sceptre! It can rouse slow blood. Wake laggards . . . Up, ye Cornish Lords, to hunt! You have already eaten—I have livened Your long repose—Up, men! . . . The bells, the bells, the bells! Let out your hounds to echo them! Mark. Brave fool! To hunt—the trail lies well. Audret. Sire, as you ride I would ride with you and would somewhat say. [The Fool noisily drives all out, and descends the steps. Mark. Seek me!—Yseult, this hour of bitterness You roused, and I in vengeance kept awake, May God forgive! Let us forgive each other. Seek rest—as I the holy dusk and dew Through which I track the wolf. I am ashamed Your lash could make me heat your cheeks. Forgive! Yseult. I could not longer Have listened to these follies; I am weary. I suffer, Mark! Mark. The evening give you grace, Its grace! Yseult. Farewell, my lord! Mark. Farewell, poor Queen. Repose—forget! We were feasting—we are men. [He kisses her brow and turns away. The Fool on the steps, leading down to the passage, watches with lit eyes. As the King passes he leaves the steps, doffs and shows a bare head. Fool, if she call, no more of thy chimeras; No more that name be mentioned to the Queen. Amuse her with some tale of love— Some debonair, gay plot. Serve me. The Fool (kissing his hand to the King). Hunt first! [The King and his following go out. Suddenly the Fool, covering his face with his hands, sinks a heap on the steps of the great hall that descends into the passage. Yseult is in Brangaena's arms. Yseult. Why was I born? It is a bitter thing When life is dust and ashes and yet lives Beheld and laughed across. Would this veil were The stirless pall of death, laid over, over! There was—where is he . . . That fool, wry monster, twisted in a cross? Brangaena, in ill-hour he came within: He is a mage, enchanter, divinator: He knows what you and I and—Tristan only Can know; by magic and by lot he knows. I am undone. I perish . . . fall in ruins! Brangaena. O loved, but if It should in truth be Tristan . . . Yseult. Tristan—that! He has a brow the light makes shadow on, And hair as ruddy and as full of leaf As beech-leaves when they crisp and cling in frost. This counterfeit of devils, This hideous creature, Tristan! But God curse him; Cursed be the hour that he was born, and cursed The ship that sailed him nor with warping timbers Could draw him to these salt depths where the cup Of my enchantment rolls! Brangaena. The mad magician May be a chosen messenger from Tristan. Yseult. From Tristan who has blabbed, and told what noon Covered in cloth of gold, as a great harp Is covered from corrosion. Vile the lips That chirp what the great covered harp withholds! Brangaena. Perchance to win your credence, Secrets are told— Yseult. I do not think as you. Nothing reminded me of life, no pressure Or storm of the olden ages drove upon me; Nothing but wonder like the pain of death. [She groans repeatedly. But find him—learn if any recollection Leap in you as you question him. [Hearing voices the Fool has raised his head, and listens with a face full of despair; as Brangaena comes down the steps to him, he drops his staff and bells, that roll down the steps, tinkling faerily. The Fool. Brangaena, Brangaena, frank, adored, Brangaena, listen; Pity me, by the love of God! Brangaena (seized with panic). What fiend Taught you my name—a hell-burnt, hideous fool? The Fool. Long have I known it. By my head once ruddy, Unless my reason with my hair was sheared, 'Tis you who are the cause of all my sorrow, Through you I am a madman and a fool. Was it not you that failed to guard the philtre I drank upon the sea, that Yseult tasted, That was her mother's bride-gift to King Mark? Yseult, my life, my death—you gave us wine Of love to drink—then gave yourself a victim, A sacrifice vowed to atone your crime. Do you no more remember? [He has risen up and sets his eyes on her burningly. Brangaena (with a shriek of terror). No! [She turns and runs up the steps. He follows her precipitately. The Fool. Have pity, pity! Yseult— [He finds himself facing Yseult. Brangaena falls at her feet, hiding her face. He opens his arms wide, as if to clasp the Queen to his breast; but, shamefaced and wrung with agony, she recoils. He trembles and retreats towards the wall by the door, against which he supports himself. I have lived too long! Yseult denies me— Rejects me, scorns to love me, deems me vile. She hears not, feels not, as the blind, who know The flower by scent, the flower by touch; who know The stranger by his breathing, and the friend By the familiar breathing, as a power Of the air coming forward. Ah, the blind Are fearless; ah, the blind Are sure—Yseult rejects me! [He advances again. If you loved— Yseult (creeping near him). I doubt; I cannot tell . . . I do not know you, Tristan. The Fool. Queen Yseult, I am Tristan—he that has so loved you, Queen! (With new energy.) Do you remember the false chamberlain Snowed flour between my bed and the King's couch, A lance-length severed, where you lay alone, And the lance-length I leapt—our hearts were joined: But my fresh wound burst sudden, bled its drops Upon your sheet, upon the mealy boards, Betraying us to death! Yseult (she draws near, fascinated). And Tristan pleaded On his proud knees for me . . . His face was level As a white river to the King's hard gaze, While little waves of anguish moved his lips. . . . The Fool. And then the King Repented him of fire as instrument To punish your offence and cast you forth Among his lepers? . . . Nay, forget, forget! Let me not see that memory on your face . . . Think how you laid your head upon my body— Your golden head, and I its pillow— The evening I had rescued you. Forget The unbearable! . . . Yseult. That Tristan took a wife. The Fool. Virgin she is, God pardon me! This ring Fell to the ground upon my marriage-night. . . . Yseult. The ring—the ring of jasper, the green ring! [She opens her arms wide. Thine! Take me, Tristan! [He enfolds her silently—then, after a while he speaks in his own natural voice, with uncontorted face, beautiful under its dark stain. Tristan. Love, what of the ring? A dog—old Husdent— Had known me of his instinct; but a semblance Checked you . . . ah, woman, woman! . . . and a ring Contents your unbelief, a bare, green stone. Yseult. It may be all enchantment, all illusion; But by my vow that when I saw this ring, Though it should lose me, all that you commanded Of wisdom or of folly should be done— On my soul's faith, if this be wise or foolish— You see me—take me, Tristan! [She falls in swoon on his breast. He kisses her eyes and her face, till she revives and smiles to his smile. Tristan. Not to know Love in his very person! If the god Of heaven comes as the lightning, as a Fool Comes the great Lord of Jove. After wild Love Men raise their hue and cry. He fills the ears Of the beloved with eddies, with the sound Of love as of a sea that tosses wrecks, Where all is madness: and he comes half-white, Half-black, with jangling pulses, all the air And every current surging to the throb Of frenzied bells—and when he looks like hatred He is most Love, most god-like; when despised, He thinks of the old spheres he tuned at first, That are the worlds. Have you wept for me, Yseult? I have not wept; I sicken And waste away. My death is very near; I shall not come again. A nightingale I drew you, after parting, to the orchard; My anguish, like a thread, guided your steps To our trysting-fir. Then for three years I wandered; The earth around was silent; you were silent. I feigned myself a leper. You had listened To tales that I had fled an enemy, Conjured to stand in your all-hallowed name— And when I asked you alms, beneath the leper You saw me and refused me, and at last Broke in a laugh that shattered me as levin The doomed hearth it has struck. Yseult. That laugh! O Tristan, Within the church I fell upon the pavement, My arms cross-stretched. Tristan. You knew me as the bird Of love; you knew me as the death-in-life Of love, even as a leper. When I came For the last time, a Fool, you gave no sign. Yseult. I kept my vow of love—the ring, the ring! To you, O Love. . . . Tristan. I promised on saints' bones, Laid on God's shrine, your father and your mother, That loyally I would bear you over sea To Mark of Cornwall . . . and that oath was vain. This little ring has held. Yseult (in a low breath). A virgin still! She is not wife—ah! [She lets her breath pass freely. Strain me to your heart, And let our hearts be broken in their mould, And we be joined for ever. Lead me, Tristan, Away, away to the Islands of the Blest, To the country where the song is never ended That mightiest poets dream, from which no sighs Return, where we shall be. Do you remember— It was your promise when the sparrows twittered, And when the wall of air broke down with dawn, And Tristan in the orchard from Yseult Was driven away? Tristan. I said it was no sun That lighted the alternate blocks of blue And grey that build Tintagel. Yseult. Tristan, Tristan! No more to part! Tristan. I soon will hold my promise. Have we not drunk all joy, all misery? The cup is nearly void, the time approaches When this deep prophecy within my spirit Comes to its term; and when I call, Yseult, Will you be ready? Will you come, Yseult? Yseult. Tristan, my faith! You know that I shall come. Your hands, your hands—the ring! Tristan. Your tremulous lips, Dearer than any faith a ring can plight! Yseult. Your eyes—what sorrow And yet content—their love is so entire! You never seemed to look at anything Save me you held within them. But your hair, My glory—gone, gone! Tristan. Paid away—red gold To buy this moment. Yseult. And your paleness covered. . . . Tristan. A gipsy stain for this mad wayfaring. Yseult. Tristan, your voice—its nearness! Very far Are other voices. I could sob with wonder To have beside my ear deliciousness Of such warm shock. . . . To-night, to-night be ours! Tristan. Ah, if to-night . . . one parts more utterly If one must part at dawn. Death, death, O death! To drink the very soul in her, then part— Better the jangled bells of folly, better A jester's laugh! Alas, for us! Brangaena (who has been watching by the door. throws up her arms). The King! Mark enters with his following, Audret at his side. Audret. You see—they sever! Here is the proof. My life on this disguise. He is no Fool. [Tristan throws back his hood, shows his shaved head and contorted features. Tristan. Old Fool, I am no Fool! I am Sir Tristan, Tristan de Léonois. The Queen has heard my suit. She is a gentle, Fond Queen! Fair Lords, to-night I shall embrace her. Do you not know she loves me? Ha, ha, ha! Sir King, I thank you . . . Ha, ha, ha! Mark. Arrest him! He shall be punished for this insolence. I bade him never more to name that name. Tristan (springing through them as they advance to lay hands on him). She named the name, not I. Fair Lords, you chase me; Fair King, you would condemn me to the lash— Why, why? I tell you she is won. To-night I shall embrace her, and I go Far, far away to set in readiness The glassy house that I have promised her, The roses, red as blood against the sun, The crystal kindling. Mark. Hunt him from the castle! He is a Fool indeed, but to our service Intractable. Cries. Hoy, hoy! Hue, hue! Whoop, whoop! Whoop and away. Hue, hue! [Tristan leaps down the steps, snatches up his staff to defend himself, rings his bells, and points upward. Tristan. She follows me between the sky and clouds. [The Squires draw back from his blows and begin to laugh: he joins their laughter. Without haste, and kissing his hand back to them, he dances off. Mark (to Yseult). What is this Fool—what did he say? Yseult. He dances— Look, dances still . . . What is he? O my lord, I cannot tell . . . So hideous and so gay! Marc, in an evil hour he came to us. My head . . . oh, weary, aching! . . . I have heard follies and am dazed. I know not. . . . Mark. Brangaena, help! We will support the Queen, And you shall couch her. Let no sound be made! No sound within the castle! . . . Hush! [The laughter ceases near and then far.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene A vessel on the sea. Queen Yseult la Belle and Sir Kaherdin; sailors moving about. The Queen is in hunting green—a falcon on her wrist. Yseult. O the wild sea! How like a misty juggler is the sea— Such transformations! Glass of deepest dew For days, now wild and grievous. Look, Sir Kaherdin! A dusky cloud, With dusk below on ocean, like a nest Deserted by a riding bird! What strangeness, What mischief and what strangeness! While little, deadly scuds wander the wind, The adamantine wind. What wild adventure, From the wild instant in the casement-light, When, at Tintagel, as a ring of Tours, You sparkled on me my own jasper ring, With whisper of command, and I a promise, To journey to Sir Tristan! . . . Wild the morning I flew my falcon and she blocked High on your mast, her mistress seeking her! Sir Kaherdin, I flew my falcon to your ship and I Followed my falcon's flight, Simply because this ring was planted green Upon my hand and on this ring my oath. You are a stranger to me. Kaherdin. O fair Queen, I carried on my hand your jasper ring, Across this flood of sea; And my great friend, Sir Tristan, slipped it there, With story of his sorrow, Murmured to tears I would not watch. Unsay I am a stranger—but a friending stanger, If you are bent to have me strange—your squire And servant. Yseult (after a brooding silence). By what right, Sir Kaherdin, When I ascended to your ship with escort Of the Duke Audret, did you shift the plank, When I was safe, and plunge him in the sea? Kaherdin. Whew! By what right? The right to kill Sir Tristan's enemy. The man was feasting-fellow, And counsellor and creature to King Mark: Simply as I should kill a bird Injurious to a country-side. And joy It was to me to bring him down. What right? The right I have to carry you away, To bear you over sea— Love's right! [He moves away and looks over the sea. His Captain joins him, and they talk together anxiously. Yseult. Why then I am a captive—and of Love! I thought I was in freedom and to have My will, my love's accomplishing, my pleasure, As in some distant fairyland. I took This ring, I asked no question. Haughtily I swept down from Tintagel, in my garb A huntress, and Duke Audret smiled at me, And said the King would joy of my fresh colour. I am here, still in huntress's dress, though royal: I am here and for my prey. [She looses her falcon on a sea-bird. Who-whoop! Begone! Kaherdin (running to her). Queen, Queen! . . . Too late, the seagull is struck down: There is blood upon the waves! These lowering skies Already fright the crew . . . now this omen! Pray God the sailors do not mark the stain! This sport is deadly. Yseult. Ah, she scorns the flesh! Why lo, why lo! What, Destiny, my merlin, What, Destiny! [The falcon comes to her fist. Kaherdin. Queen, is it only sport That we are bound on? Have you no compassion? Yseult. There has been blood upon the waves before, Duke Audret's blood: then you had no compassion; You did not mark the stain . . . There, take my falcon, take her, Destroy her . . . Let her not be captive—there! Let her not fail of her desire . . . [She sobs over the bird and resigns it to Sir Kaherdin, waving him from her. How wet the rain is on my cheek! How I am left alone! . . . Like this I was led forth, A captive to King Mark; my Ireland left Behind me, all I loved—my still-room, my long halls, My free-lipped people, my fond mother left Behind. For me no more green land, no more Honour and youth! I found myself a captive, Snared on the sea and destined Then for King Mark, as now for Tristan—destined! And now again a ship, and now the sea! [She gazes out on the water. How great the sea is, and how full of rumours! How greater is the sea grown suddenly! I am alone, and out of all this water, And out of all this cloud, I hear a tempest puling at its birth. Brangaena! [There is no reply. Boatswain's voice rings out. Boatswain. Tempest! Braid up them sails, Strike topmast to the cap! Yseult. Tempest! I am alone. What could Brangaena Do for me in these heavens? O Tristan, Tristan, I am alone! And we must be together on the sea! Kaherdin (afar). The furrow of the vessel is a torrent, A whirlpool . . . Save the boat, hitch her aboard, Over the poop! [He passes out of sight. Sailors. A'heigh, a'heigh, a'heigh! There is no boat. The ropes slide in—no boat! She is mid the waves. She is under them. She is lost. Other Sailors. A hungering sea! What drip Of the naked feet of surges as they rush Across our planks. This rain, this wind—this death! Our shrouds are almost broke and blown away. Starboard! Take heed! Starboard—so-ho! Be damned or help us! Peace! God bless the man! Captain's Voice. Hold—keep her thus. Hold there! A hand, my boys! Lash sure the helm a'lee; We can no more! Make fast and let her drive; Let her lie under seas and let her drive! [The storm closes down. Yseult. But this is like a charm— I stand as fearless as in Africa Among my lions . . . I have stood thus in childhood Quite solitary when the nights were dark. I call these elements about me softly, As softly as a wizard . . . They are curds! I crush them in my hands. Voices. We sink, we are lost for ever. We are dead men. Our light is out. Blessed and Sacred Lady, Pray our dear Lord! In Manus . . . Save! The current washes us. Alas! We drown. [Kaherdin tears through the veil of wind and rain. He lashes her to a mast. Kaherdin. Queen, for your life . . . for his! [He is driven away by the hurricane toward the spot where the Captain and some sailors are trying to save a man, who has just been swept over. Yseult. It makes no change— Only, now they have bound me, I look forth On all that I have suffered as on spots, And cities in a landscape. Tristan, Tristan, I see thee as we parted on the edge Of the forest and you led My palfrey, and you held The bridle ready in your hand to yield it Back to King Mark. We parted from the forest, Tristan, for what? For cold and poverty, For cold and hunger, as two peasants might: The tempest was too strong for us, the wind Blew through your ragged cloak—you lit a fire Sometimes in the mid-forest and sat down, And stared at it and dreamed as a dull hunter By any winter hearth! . . . Here is a fire. [She catches at the lightning. An arrow and a momentary lamp! Here are the winds— And here in some sharp crevice of my heart Is Tristan . . . now indeed I am enchantress, And hold him to me, as I hold the wind; And do not call upon his name, but hold him At pleasure, at my pleasure, in a niche— Or chase him as a fowler for my pleasure. O wind of fire! Tristan, no more in a far country—now Swept inward on my heart, and we together, Deaf to all noise, at the still roots of fire, Where they branch living up, at the mid core Of whirlwind, where the winds are intercoiled To break forth to their quarter! Wind of fire! [Brangaena is revealed in a cleft of light. Brangaena. What is this singing through the wind? (A clear laugh is heard.) Where is she? Yseult. No eagle rides so high; No moon so fast flees through the clouds; Tristan, no little leaf upon the stream Voyages on so buoyantly—the wind Couches me on her plumes . . . This travelling Is of Love's very pace. O wind of fire! Brangaena. I have not heard her voice so jubilant Since she sang free across the Irish lakes. [Kaherdin, driven against her by the wind, touches her ear with his lips. Kaherdin. The wheel still stands . . . Three men are overboard. [He is blown from her. Brangaena. Each quite alone in the tides, then at the base Of the fathoms, still alone! And she must die In these waters—these deep graves; go down to death! (To Yseult.) O loved, you will not reach the shore—desist! The sea will overtake us . . . how it runs! The lightning—hoh!—will drink our life! You will not reach Sir Tristan; never more Will you look upon his face. Yseult. Brangaena! Close, Knot yourself in my arms! . . . [They clasp: Yseult strokes Brangaena's head. These voyages Are very prosperous. You brought me fortune On that dear voyage. I had drunk with Mark, Except you had been faithless in your charge, And on your bed-shelf laid the little phial: But I have drunk with Tristan. Every breath That I would breathe again—all of my years That is not with the dust is of your sweet And reckless error. Cleave to me, beloved, Adventure with me! Brangaena. Pray! We are near death. Let me not lose you . . . Pray! Yseult (shaking her head). I had drunk with Mark, Save for your error: I have drunk with Tristan. Brangaena. Consider but the moment. Loved, the corpses Are washing past . . . See, see! Yseult. The storm has sundered wide away. How light They wash upon the waves! I am cut sharp, These ropes against my heart . . . Brangaena, go, Fetch me Sir Kaherdin, for the great wind Is folding up its pinions, for the sky Is massing thunderous . . . The sum is scorching, and I feel the knots. [Brangaena leaves her. Am I deserted? My envoys fled? This silence has no clefts For the rock-pigeons . . . Brittany in sight, So close at hand, so close—a monument It looks—and I would sail away from it: A foreign shore; the ships Are painted different, like flowers Of another country. This is not the land He promised me. Alack, I am the fool. And what now is my errand? O Tintagel, It is a tame, low coast. What do I here, And here in majesty? Let them not dream— Not dream . . . I will not take the buffets of his Court. I . . . O my fool! [Kaherdin approaches with Brangaena. Kaherdin (at a distance to the sailors). Clear down the decks, set south our wheel . . . Unroll Our snowy sails to daylight! Wide their wings! [Joyously approaching Yseult. We have sighted land. . . . Yseult. I am writhed, I cannot stir— Oh, swift! Unknot the cords. Kaherdin (dazzled by her beauty). Or shall I leave you bound, my Sovereign Huntress, And so deliver you to Tristan—heigh? You loosed the storm; you have cost many lives . . . Shall I unknot you? [He looks up at her. Yseult (straining from the cords). But who is it speaks? Kaherdin (hastily unknotting the cord). What can it matter, My sorrow—who I am! Has the rope jarred? The little smart will heal . . . I shall present you Safe to Sir Tristan—and so beautiful! . . . The rain has scarcely dashed your dress. Your falcon Is cherished for you. . . . Shall I fetch your falcon? I did not listen to your cruel word Let her not fail of her desire. She shall not! Nor shall lord Tristan fail of his desire. Yseult. Who are you? Tristan's friend? But I have never heard him name your name. Kaherdin. Nor had he uttered yours until the morning I stepped aboard my vessel. . . . I have knowledge Of many things that you must overcome. There is no welcome for you on our shores; My father had no knowledge of my sailing— Yonder is Carhaix—underneath that cloud Sir Tristan lies. There are so many things . . . If you can put them all away and voyage To Brittany, as I sailed to Tintagel, It will be nothing, when you see Yseult— Nothing. Yseult. Yseult? There is but one Yseult. Kaherdin. O Queen, there is Yseult of the White Hands— Nothing! My sister—that is nothing too . . . I gave that up in my great love for Tristan: But she is fast his wife. . . . Yseult (after a long pondering). I do not think I can touch land again, And very certainly I cannot live In any ceilèd house, in any palace. Bear him down to me, we will take him in, And we will give him tendance on the seas. Kaherdin. No, lady, we must do Sir Tristan's will. He is our Prince; my father is beside him, My sister by him— We cannot banish these. No, you must climb The steep, and then the stairs, and face the crowd, And bear the whispers of the crowd, and bear My sister's face. [Yseult considers. Yseult. Then there must be procession, And singing through the streets. I shall come royal To visit him in state. Kaherdin. But he is dying. We do not think of you and of your state; We only think of Tristan, we so love him, We cannot let him die— We cannot bear to hear him moan. O lady, Slow in compassion, will you let him die? Yseult (rocking in anguish). Melt me; you do not melt! I have not left my state of sovereignty, And my great honour as a queen, nor left King Mark, my husband, nor have I deserted Tintagel, nor have broken with my own Bitter and sweet captivity, nor made My throne a hollow place, that I should heal One who is but impatient of his pain. [She turns away and looks out. The sun is sudden bright . . . I see Something that shines out hard; it does not stir, Does not grow nearer; it remains a speck. (Turning back.) What is it? [Kaherdin at a sign from the Sailors has left her side and is speaking with them. [Yseult takes Brangaena's hand in hers and leans her other hand on the wrist of the hand she has grasped. Now I see that little speck, And note the tiny dottings on the shore, I recollect how I have left Tintagel, And the wide breasts of the heaving sea, to sit Beside his bed—and presently When he is healed, depart; for I will give him The things he asks for . . . But my feet are held Back at the heel: I cannot land, I cannot Be so acclaimed— We will sweep past the coast, Until the ship shall enter its own kingdom, And haven of itself. I cannot land! [To Kaherdin, who approaches. Sir Kaherdin, you must put back the ship. Kaherdin. No more commands! I cannot serve you more. The sails hang to the masts; And we are strait becalmed. Will this not melt you? He is dying, our great Tristan, dying, And yet he cannot die, And yet he will remain without your face. [She takes the sail and wrings it in her hands: then speaks, as if possessed, and with the actions of a mime. Yseult. There are so many ways! Not come to you! But I will surely come to you in sleep, And move about the room. . . . Not tend on you! I have seen you thus before. What, hide from me? You were worse-featured, as a fool, a leper, My sunken One! There, there! I will not look . . . The fire is dead; You must have warmth. [She kneels as if with faggots in her hand. Tristan, I let my mother Nurse you before. I was as green, young wood, Ill-furnished . . . and I let my mother nurse you! But I am shaking now with jealousy. Yseult's Yseult—Yea, I am Queen Yseult— [She rises. My raiment rustles soft. Tristan, but this Is sweeter magic than the cup. You bless me? You must not—that must be when you are healed. (Shrinking). Yes, presently I look into your hurt . . . not so impatient, So anxious! You must let me raise your head. Now you must drink, Beloved . . . [She falls back into Brangaena's arms with a shrill cry. Brangaena. Is it a vision? Yseult. No, no! He may be dreaming and in dreams I must be talking to him . . . It retires! Mute is the darkness, but more mute the sun. I cannot labour to him any more. Kaherdin. The whiteness of her mouth, her face! Brangaena, Wine for your mistress. Yseult. I will drink no wine! She dare not bring me wine upon the sea; She dare not with her woman's hands approach Mine with the cup. [Brangaena trembles. Kaherdin. Queen, Queen, but you will faint. Yseult. I shall not faint. [Raising herself heavily and looking round on the blue spaces. Think of the draught; think of that summer sea, The summits of the sea! Look yonder! In no foam a porpoise rolls . . . [Pressing to the side of the vessel. Tristan had turned Away from me, dumb in the over-measure And the extravagance of his desire, Having drained the magic draught . . . I followed him . . . How should I? Drawn on forward, as a tide. He heard me . . . and I heard my steps . . . [She laughs as if she were alone. Beyond The bay a porpoise rolled for the sun's joy. As still a noon as this—the elements So wreathed together, as before us now, And the still sea that beat up as a sun. Brangaena, you Cast down the cup into a void like this, Into low, breezeless sea! Brangaena. Peace, peace! Turn from the blaze, kneel down with me and pray. Yseult. Brangaena, in a calm? . . . This moves me you can pray. [She gazes out on the water. Power of the Sea! It is a wall against me. Far away Is Tristan, for a calm divides far more Than leagues of air— I shall not move to him, till, as a chapel Wafted of angels, I am slided down To lay my tomb beside him, in his tomb. [She moves down the vessel, looking in the water: Kaherdin follows her anxiously. Brangaena kneels and prays. The ocean only of its movement heaves, Not onward to the shore . . . We must take temper Of our condition, show its loveliness, Who are within the firmament as spirits Within a pearl . . . (With low laughter.) We must beguile the time. [Turning and speaking shrilly in Kaherdin's ear. Speak to me of Sir Tristan. He was young When first my mother tended him, his hair Deep as a bud is deeper than the flower: His beauty startled me. Is his hair grown again, The beautiful, deep russet, deepening hair? [Kaherdin weeps. She lays her hand on his shoulder. You know he travelled to me as a fool; And once he travelled to me as a leper: These images are blocked against the sun. Have mercy on me, Kaherdin! Kaherdin. Behold! The sea is as a web we cannot pierce: There is no comfort there, no mercy there. But what of that? For he is white and blemished as a leper, For he is wild and crazy as a fool; And, if the calm should break, he would affright you With his wild looks. His hair is colourless, Is dead, his visage Measled with venom. Queen, you would not know him— How should you, if you think but of his beauty? [Yseult wrings her hands and turns from Kaherdin. Yseult. . . . We must beguile the time. [She retraces her steps and disturbs Brangaena at her prayer. Tell me, Brangaena, of the roots you plucked . . . He is wasted; Kaherdin Tells me he is sore-wasted. As a bird Beating about my head I take this knowledge. . . . You see the vessel Stands still for ever. Let me hear the charms. Brangaena. Loved, wherefore? But the roots I have forgotten. I am so sleepy. Is it for my torture You question me? Yseult. The roots, the squealing mandrake— It must be painted all upon your brain. . . . You see the vessel Stands still forever. Let me hear the charms, The incantations—sing to me some snatches Of the invocation, of the stirring-tune, The benison. Remember You were preparing for my wedding-night. Did you not laugh and jest and kiss together? I thirst as a parched honeycomb— The little, ribald rhymes, the lullabies, The couplets, the forbidding! Queen Yseult, How looked she on that day? A child, I heard Your footsteps plodding in the upper room, And roused and fed my dogs. Brangaena. A child. Let be! Yseult. I had no waking From childhood and no waking into love; It was all thrust on me. Brangaena. Your lady-mother Was clad that day in a deep brown, with spots And currents in the web. Yseult. But of the philtre! Was there no burthen to the ritual, Among the spurting juices Of the alembic and the magic wheel— No music for the shredding of the herbs? Brangaena. Your mother did not sing. Yseult. The deep-brown robe, No music? [She sighs deeply. Brangaena. . . . Stay, there was A music: I can give it you no more Than the smell, the fresh smell of the herbs and flowers As they were bruised that day . . . There is a music Comes from the pain, As it were startled and escaped. . . . Yseult. No pain! [She looks down more wistfully into the water. Enumerate the flowers, The flowers, the spices. Did you pluck the flowers? Tell me their names, And how the sweet brew thickened from the cast, And drenchèd leaves. Brangaena. No, no! I am too old, And all that I remember of that day Is that I pledged my faith. I cannot choose . . . Yet, if I must—She bade me fetch sea-holly, With poppies of the sand. It was a marvel To see her nip the little seeds and count them, The innumerous, eyed seeds, and count them over As clean as they were pearls. Yseult. You are smiling—ha! At last a smile! Brangaena. ‘And where the sphinx-moth hives, Brangaena, rest you in the furzy wood, And look for the long-throated, Blandishing honeysuckle, that no bee Can ever fathom—honey for my child, And for her lover sweetness So haunting, so reserved, even from his grave He will desire her; she shall be desired While she draws breath and even from her grave.’ Yseult (who has been looking down intently into the water). Brangaena, There is a music rising From the sea and from the wedges of the rocks, And from the sluices of these hollow homes, I hear it—dolorous— From the edges and the sliding parapets. Would I were nearer—such a fringe of sound! I would descend, And pluck the music to me as a flower. Is it the Sirens? [Brangaena draws her violently away. Brangaena. Oh, come back! What should I hear? My faculties are dulled. What should I know? Have pity on me, turn Away from these deceits. I lose you, sweet, If you bend down so far. It is the Sirens! And I am loosing hold. In pity come! My arms relax—in pity, Come back to me! Loved, pray! [She sinks back, her arms stretched to Yseult. Yseult (laughing). It is the Sirens, if you are so childish; It is the music sunken in the sea. A multitude Remote and singing—yet a drop At the bottom of the flood that has one voice! No, do not fear! I must go down to it. Do not be scared, Do not betray me any more. [Yseult dips her hands in the water and bathes her forehead; then nestles in Brangaena's arms. Now I can sleep. Brangaena (with growing terror). No! Should you sleep, These sounds you hear . . . Rouse, love, arouse yourself! Yseult. Sleeping and waking are but as the shores Of the peace that washes them on either side. . . . I never saw the orchard So bright before and laden with such fruits— Apples, and little, gadding cucumbers, And vetches up the trees . . . Oh, see! But not with his disparkled hair, Not stained and hurt—he is come down to his pleasance, And, my sad knight, he smiles! Brangaena. Child, these are dreams . . . Yseult! Yseult! Yseult. I am awake. Brangaena. What do you hear, what spell is on you? Yseult. Now It is the thrush's voice—ah, inland, deep, Sprung from the forest. . . . Brangaena. Then a dream— Not from the sea! Then this is but a dream Of the great Morais Forest and the whistling Between the branches of the summer birds. Yseult. No, no: this music, I often heard it at my casement. Then It broke my heart, so wildly It sang of summer. It is Tristan sings, Calling me to him for my death—the whistle Of a bird lost at sea. It is Tristan, hark! Kiss me, Brangaena . . . For you see the calm Is very wide, the landmark but a cry. . . . Brangaena. Why do you rise? Where would you go? [Yseult moves a little way; then turns back as if from sight of a desert. Yseult. Kiss me, Brangaena. Let me feel your hands! [Brangaena, with a piercing cry, falls. Her flesh is warm—it tingles on my flesh. [She looks round helplessly, trying to touch things. I have chilled the music and the breath of it Cannot flow back . . . Yet I am firm and sound; And the ship is sailing on— [She starts in terror at the sudden heave of the ship and lays her hand on the wheel; as Kaherdin and the helmsman spring forward, she fronts them white as a statue, and motionless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene A bare room; at the back a terrace, with a wall breast-high, stretches against the sea. A broad step runs along under the wall; below it a couch has been made of wolf-skins, over which is laid an emerald silk coverlid, broidered over with gold wheels. A great golden harp stands behind the couch. There is a deeply-recessed door to the left. Tristan is clinging to the top of the wall by his hands, clamped on the outer edge. His arms are supported to the elbow on the breadth of the wall. The old Duke Hoël stands with his back to the sea, close to Tristan, who wears a tunic of cloth of gold. His face, when seen, is fever-struck, under the mass of his russet hair. The hour is toward evening. Hoël. Rest, rest! Tristan. No sail! Clouds move across my sight. . . . Hoël. I should be able to discern a speck, The mast's first climbing, for my eyes have strength To see the stars at noontide. Let me watch, And, for God's love, lie down. Tristan (speaking fast). The sea, stretched out before me as a shield, An unscathed shield! What arrow pierces it? What dances round the rock? What glistening pennon and what sudden toss Of fairy-roses? I have seen her face . . . I cannot leave such joy out there at sea. Hold me up firm . . . She is travelling, as God Travels the heavens; she is speeding on; The passion of her speeding stops my heart. But though she travel fast there is such weakness And such despair in me I can but call, And call to her. It is my great lament To call upon the name that cannot hear, To call while I have any voice—and after God make me but a moan across the wind, A spirit at her ears! Yseult, Yseult, Yseult!—A sail, a promise! O the sea, The sea-wind and the sea! . . . You know at last: Thus was it with me, thus—the King of Cornwall Kept her a priceless harp he could not play, That every time I touched it was my own, The instrument that useless The King kept by him, mine, mine in its music, Each spark, the very form and hope of it. I would have sold my God to buy that harp . . . Thus, thus it was . . . Yseult! [He bows his head on his strained arms and weeps. After a while, he lifts his head. I have told you, father, all. You are wise and old, You are pitiful with the long days and quiet, As old woods in their midst . . . I have told you all. [Hoël does not speak. Can you tell her? Hoël. Let be, my son, let be! Why should we tell her? Let be! Tristan. My fine high Queen, she will not come to me, Wrapt in disguise; she will be wrapt in gold, A gold crown on her head, and, in her hands Drawn up, the deep veil of her golden hair She will gather in her hands. I see the vision! And of herself she will give no account; But simply, swiftly striding through the hall, Pass as a sentinel the word Yseult. I fear her— She has many wrongs. Must not your daughter know? Hoël. In breaking news, God breaks it best . . . She has marvellous black hair, My little daughter . . . Could you so mistake, Sir Tristan?—She has marvellous black hair. [Tristan groans. Tristan. I fear I am a poet. Oh, the burthen Of seeing all creation as one God! Have you not kissed a child for just one note In a dead voice, and do you heed the child? She must be told! Hoël. Nay, nay! If it should kill her! [Tristan, still gripping the wall with one arm, looses with the left arm and turns round to face Duke Hoël. Tristan. . . . She must be told, that she may stand aside As at a pageant . . . Even to be born In the age when such a vision may be seen! For she will come in all her majesty, And as I have not seen her, for her eyes Burnt low beneath her crown when I did homage, And her cheek sank to hollow of the grave. Remember! I have bidden her across the waves. Have mercy! Consider her . . . We must clothe her in great titles. Hoël. My son, well may we say she is a Queen, The Queen Yseult, who of her charity . . . Tristan. O sweet, but she is beautiful; her beauty Shines forth of her . . . She comes As to a cry. Hoël. She comes to bring you health; Fair son, this I will say:— Your wife would have you healed, for tenderly She loves you, Tristan. Tristan. She must stand aside, As at a pageant, she must hold her peace. I know not what will be . . . She must be told. Go, father, as you love me—go! [Wearily he clings again to the wall and gazes seaward. Duke Hoël leaves the room doubtfully, then returns and stands in mute expostulation by Tristan's side. What, would you watch with me? Hoël. For you are ill . . . I would most gladly watch with you, my son. You are weak; you cannot watch. Tristan. She has come down from her throne, she has touched the sand, I think she walks the sea. Such condescension Is infinite, a miracle of love. Hoël (aside). My little daughter— And if I told her, what would that avail? Tristan. You shall not tell her. Watch along with me, Watch for the Queen Yseult, and I will sing The burthen of her coming. Let her rule! She is strong enough to face all circumstance: But we must take her coming as the visit Of something holy. Think not of your daughter, And the few tears that she will shed. This Queen Has left Tintagel, and the fairy palace Is adamant behind her: this wide sea She never can re-cross; she wraps herself In the sea to come to me; it is her shroud, And she can never take it off. . . . Hoël. My son, What would you have me do? If you should die— And there is often death in your wild movements. Tristan. What should you do? In pictures Have you not seen, when a bright Power comes in, How in a corner somewhere, with veiled eyes, There is a little group . . . I shall not die: Nothing can be at all until she come. Hoël. The sea is dead becalmed. Tristan. I do not know . . . We must make ready for her, long before, As a mother for her child. It is the hope That feeds the patience! There must be vast carpets Laid on the rugged steps: her feet will bleed On the sharp rock; for you forget She has no garment on her but the sea, This Queen with fading fairyland behind, Who stoops to touch our coast. [He unclasps from the wall and turns with his back to the sea. I brushed the dew Away when she has met me in the meadows, The mossy meadows of the wood, with feet Laid bare for silence . . . She has met me, father, Once in a wood, the moonlight keeping guard— That night the dial shone as at the noon, Keeping its point meridian. (In a soft voice.) Watch with me! Sir Hoël, you are changing, you have felt How music can grow small and wrap itself Into a beating odour . . . Kaherdin Is gone as on a quest: If he come back, if you can watch with me, The music that you listen to, and wonder How still the lilies are and how the stars Are weeping over us—you have not known, You have not seen before—all this will open, And as the benison descends on us, There will be passing to and fro of ships From coast to coast; through little golden channels They dart and glide, and there is no more sea; But ever launching, ever setting forth, Ever to touch the land, and all the shores Haunted by little steps of primroses . . . [Dreamily he turns again to the sea, fixing his eyes on it and shading them. I thought I saw a ship. Hoël. No ship! Let me support you . . . Do not fail. No matter The sea is calm; there is quiver through the sea, As it would burst its heart. Tristan. No ship in harbour? Do not the sea-birds flap up from the surf? I see them; there is scurry by the wharves! Hoël. No, no! We yet must wait, but there is quiver Now in the sea as it must burst its heart. Loose from the wall and let me lay you down; Your nails are bleeding. Tristan. Hold me, keep your place. Yseult of Brittany enters behind them Hoël. Hush! Tristan. Who is that? Hoël. Your wife. Yseult of Brittany. What are you watching for? Father, draw in Our Tristan; it is cold. Tristan. Tell her! [His hands relax and he slips down on his knees by the wall; then falls back swooning into Duke Hoël's arms. Yseult. What is it? These hands are very cold . . . Oh, he is dying, And the wide eyes are drooping, growing dark. The long, slow breaths—a tide To bury him away, more deep, more slow Than breathing! Tristan, Tristan! He suffers! God, awake these eyes, in mercy, And bid the brow spring naked that so sunken Stretches in shadow . . . Father, You stood together, you were looking forth; I came upon you as I were not one, The nearest to you both. I am Tristan's wife, And he has swooned: I am your child, your daughter. Withhold not this thing from me. Hoël (roughly). There, make place, Give way! give way! [He lifts Tristan and carries him to the couch; then, when he has laid him down, raised his head, and given him a cordial, he rises. Yseult (opposing him at the foot of the couch). Instruct me what to do. Hoël (laughing). Drag down vast carpets, cover all the stairs, Make ready—my command to you—make ready, As if it were a god. Yseult (astonished, gazing at the form before her). You mean a funeral? Hoël (drawing her to him). Make ready, child. [He sets her on his knee. Come here. There must be changes; And, as you put it, in a funeral We know the change and we prepare for it Our pomps and our solemnities. Child, there are other changes— As if a ship comes freighted full of gold, And bursts its treasure at a beggar's feet; Changes that cost one's wits . . . [His eyes streaming with tears. Put back this hair; It is better braided up; yes, tuck it up . . . And sweep the rooms and haul down the great carpets . . . Make ready so. Yseult. I will not stir. Hoël. He has been singing to me, child...Make ready! Do not disturb your husband. Presently When he awakes say I have told you all: Say you are ready and the carpets laid . . . It is his pleasure. Yseult. Nay, He told you all, my father, and his pleasure Is that you give me burthen of the tale From your own lips. Hoël. Child, child! It was not so he told it . . . It sang forth From the spices of the sea. [Tristan cries in his sleep. He is calling, child; Listen, he mutters . . . he may tell you all. Yseult. He is calling me—Yseult! He is calling me. Loose, let me go! Hoël. If you will say my words— You must prepare, You will be ready; I have told you all. [She kneels by Tristan, and Duke Hoël goes out. Yseult. Tristan! But in his sleep he called to me. Tristan! I answer back . . . How strange it is That they should be so hard on me; my father So hard . . . I have my secret to myself: For if they could suspect they would be angry; They would not follow Tristan. Something strange There is grown up among them: Kaherdin Kissed me and did not say he would return, Or where he sailed. I weep, I must weep for him sorer, bitterer, Than if I mourned him dead. [Thrumming with her fingers on the coverlid. Tristan has travelled Once—twice: I know not The country he has journeyed to. He comes Dishevelled and most wonderful, his eyes Fresh-jewelled with fresh stones. I do not ask What perils he has met, Nor why he cut away his shining hair, Nor how it is he comes back as one blasted, Who cannot eat among us any more, Nor laugh among us, nor take rest . . . I do not ask That he should play the harp, I feel he cannot; And yet he must—for now There is between us nothing but a name, Unless we have our marriage in his music; For I can lay my head Against his harp, I can caress his harp, And he caresses back. [Leaning against the golden harp. For just this song In the bosom of the harp I understand, As if it were the cooing of a child. [Wringing her hands. I shall not bear a child, Nor yet, nor ever, for before the year Of his vow is ended Tristan will be dead. What is it so forbidden in our nuptials? I ask myself—I do not ask my father, I do not ask my brother; For if I heard the answer from my father, Or from my brother . . . It is best to hear Nothing, but in the way his harp can tell; To be the little, dark Yseult he loves. Tristan (opening his eyes). Yseult! Yseult. You have waked soon, my dear—but I am ready, And all is at your pleasure. You have called me . . . Shall I not dress your wound? You call so softly . . . And yet such pain . . . [As Tristan rises and moans. Tristan, he told me all . . . Now let my dress your wound . . . Not that? Then say What you would have me do? I am all patience. [Tristan stretches his hand out wearily toward the harp. Your harp! Ah, then indeed you will make ready, Will you not, Tristan? I shall learn the burthen Of a new song! I give you all your pleasure! [He plays a sad air. But these are ancient notes—and nothing new To startle me! Love's music! [She stoops to kiss Tristan, who is touching his harp again and again, his face turned from her. Tristan (suddenly turning his face). Little, dark Yseult, you curse me—but I loved your love, Answering your name . . . Yseult. Re-enter Duke Hoël Hoël. There! She will have you healed by blackest arts— Ho, ho! by blackest arts; and she will suffer That a great Queen shall sit beside your couch— As well she knows wise women may be found Tutored by nature; and there is no cause For jealousy, her father Being well-content. (To Yseult.) Your brother in his ship Is bearing home this Wizard-Queen to Carhaix, For once she healed our Tristan of his hurt, A venomed hurt. Your hands, These fair, white hands cannot draw forth the sting Of fatal poison . . . Girl, you have a husband Of tender nurture, one who grieves for you, Who grieves to put you from your nurse's place, Who loves you and besought of me, your father.... Yseult (to Tristan). A nurse for you, a wizard-herbalist, A Queen! Tristan, I kiss you pardon. And you feared To grieve me. . . . Tristan (smiling.) All the way of love is grief. . . . Her chamber Be in the Tower that looks forth to the west. Can you not make it ready? Yseult. I shall meet her; Beloved, I am the hostess to your Queen; And she shall dress your wound. Then I shall come To watch again, to soothe you at your pillow, While our wise, royal guest shall pass to banquet, My brother humbly waiting on her. Tristan. Father, You have deceived me. She must understand— Hoel. She will, when you are healed from death. Go, child, You shall make ready; as you are my child, Shall be a hostess and not bring me shame. Prepare the lodging as your husband bids For the great stranger lady— Tristan (standing by his harp and flashing with light). For Yseult, My life, my death—the sole song of my harp, Yseult of Ireland, my one heritage— There is one Tristan, there is one Yseult. [Yseult of Brittany rises from the couch, where she has been sitting, and clutches her black plaits in either hand. She is fair-haired, Yseult of the White Hands; She loves me, never has she broken faith. There is one Tristan, there is one Yseult. [Yseult of Brittany goes up to Tristan's harp, gathers some of the wires in her hand and wrenches them from their pegs. Tristan breaks into mournful laughter. Hoël. Come, child, away! [She faces Tristan's laughther a moment; her eyes blank, the wires of the harp in her fingers. Then, with a cry, she goes out, followed by Duke Hoël. Tristan. Now she has stabbed Yseult, There is no more Tintagel— And the great fairy-castle blown to earth! The rock, the height, the sunset—it is gone: Nor is there anything to happen more. My harp is dead, and all blown down. The harp— [His hand passing over it falls through a hollow. The power to call her through the world And all its quarters gone. My harp—a chasm! [In white shining a golden sail streams across the far sea, high above. A wide-wrenched throat—no voice, Nor any power to call . . . The harp! She never loved it; she has laughed at me For a harper; but she did not laugh at me For a fool; she loved me with the bells . . . But it is still now, and I must be dying— For what remains, what can remain . . . The fool! Love's fool!—She loved me with the bells, that music Chimed well . . . Soft, it is coming . . . [He listens. As a magic suit of armour to my wars, As a vision of a shield—a sound of bells Borne to me! A slow boom of sound Thickens the air . . . A passing-bell! And I will count the years. [The bell strikes thirty and then stops. A passing-bell! God's patience with my soul! [Slowly a new sound intrudes as of a muffled sob: it grows. Tristan rises vehemently. I cannot listen, I cannot bear to hear. I know our ears Are given, I know my ears Are given for the voices of my hands Upon the harp: all other sounds Whelm me as tides advancing to o'erwhelm. They are all come to drown me, all these sounds, They are nothing but pursuit—they are dogging me. This is a master-fiend— It clutches, bumps . . . Ho! it is in the roof, It is overhead . . . Why are you here?—This sound? [His wife comes close to him. Yseult of Brittany (with flaming eyes). A great bell, and it sounds out far to sea. Tristan. You are hating me. Yseult. It is a Christian bell. Tristan. You are hating me. Yseult (with a passionate gesture). Give up your soul to God. I love you, Tristan! Tristan, I love you, I would save your soul. I love you—not a fiend dare brave us now, Not if you listen, while I pray. I love you . . . Then drink the holy drops . . . these from the chapel! I sprinkle, scatter the dews over him— There! While I pray. . . . [Tristan has sunk back on the couch. Yseult of Brittany kneels by the bed, snatches his hand and kisses her prayers on it. Gradually a long trill of laughter crosses the dirge. Tristan starts up. Tristan. I hear a laugh . . . I cannot see! Laugh on, Laugh close—I cannot hear! . . . But I can hear a voice . . . It is her voice. She is laughing at the bells—she hears the bells . . . Remain—behold! [He clutches Yseult's hands and keeps them locked in his. A Voice. Bells, bells! The fool's bells, are they jangling still? My fool, my fool! And do you ring, so solemn Because a fool is dead? Give place! [He looses Yseult's hands and pushes her from him. My fool, my fool! Where shall I find him? [A mystic company enters, as if blown along on flame: in front Queen Yseult and Brangaena. Queen Yseult (imperiously to the other Yseult). Stop the bells! Let there be peace. I come to fetch him—go! Stop the bells—and return! Give me a cup . . . [Yseult of Brittany rises and goes out. We are athirst! How lank this hair, how dim These soiled, wet eyes! Not blind? . . . Brangaena, give us The very cup—from the bottom of the sea, Washed up to me in the hollows of the calm! We are not mocked . . . Now, see! Then feel it, Tristan— Stuck round with barnacles! . . . Love, is it harsh To these dear fingers? They must wreathe it round. [Tristan's nostrils expand. Now smell!—It is the very cup. Brangaena Came with it in her hands—she has atoned; She is our cupbearer—ha, ha! for ever! Not you—be gone! [She breathes on Yseult of the White Hands, who enters, trembling, with a cup . . . Yseult creeps away. Then Queen Yseult turns to Duke Hoël, who has advanced with wine. Yes, any wine on earth You may pour into it—that is no matter— I have sucked brine from it, and all its odours And all its herbs translated. See, Beloved, Not yet . . . You must not drink it—by-and-by There will be no more patience and no room For memory . . . Look at the cup! . . . A perfume Breaks from its sides as ambergris; smell, smell! We are not mocked . . . How free we are to talk To one another! Tristan (shuddering). Did you drag it up? Will you not sign the Cross. I am afraid. Yseult. Fool, fool to the last! Brangaena fished it up, And with a mortal hook. [She laughs low, caressing him. Fool, I am with you, And on your errand! Do you know our bourne When we have drunk this potion? Tristan. O my Death, But you are gripping me in tighter bonds Than any I have known. Yseult. How dear to find you So mortal and so timid! Must I snatch you? Will you not drink? Tristan (stammering). God's love. . . . [Again Yseult laughs. Yseult. I am come to fetch you, Tristan, to me—it is your Hell or Heaven. [She drinks. His hand fastens on the cup, and he drinks too, then falls back. The mystic company has faded. Tristan lies dead. A solemn chanting is heard: Kaherdin and his sailors enter with the dead body of Queen Yseult. She is laid beside Tristan. There is a sound of magic music in the profound silence of the room round the dead lovers.</field>
