      <field name="fulltext">CELEBRARE DOMESTICA FACTA. âHor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. ADDRESS TO THE TRAGIC MUSE, WRITTEN BY WILLIAM SOTHEBY, Esq. And Spoken by Mr. C. KEMBLE. Oh Thou! around whose throne, in awful state, By Fear and Pity rang'd, the passions wait: At whose commanding call, from every age, Hosts swept by death from Nature's changeful stage; Chiefs, and stern patriots, and the scepter'd train, Rise from the tomb, and glow with life again! Before thy lifted eye, th'Historic Muse Presents the pageant of her passing views; And, on the column of recording time, Points sculptur'd groups of Virtue, Woe, and Crime. Tamer of Man! beneath thy boundless reign Wild Fancy shapes her visionary train, Embodies airy beings all her own, And rules, with wizard wand, the world unknown; Leagues the weird Sisters where the night-storm raves, Drags howling spectres from reluctant graves; Bids fear, with icy dew-drops, freeze the frame, When horror broods o'er âdeeds without a name;â From realms of tortur'd spirits lifts the veil, And half reveals th'unutterable tale. Yet, sov'reign of the soul! thy sway refin'd, Charms while it awes, afflicts, yet soothes the mind: Guardian of moral sense, and feeling shame, Firm guide of Virtue, mask'd in Pleasure's name: Lo! on Guilt's glowing cheek, strange drops appear, Where burns, like molten lead, the new-born tear: Lull'd by thy voice, the painful struggles cease, Mild Melancholy breathes returning peace; Repentance forms a wish to be forgiv'n, And Angels waft a pray'r half-breath'd to Heav'n. Oh! while thy forceful strokes at will controul, Or tender touches humanize the soul! Send Terror forth, the vengeful goddess guide, Tame the mad insolence of earthly pride; Each dire vicissitude of life reveal, Till trembling tyrants fear what wretches feel; Send Pity forth, and while her suasive pow'r Allures to woe the sadly-pleasing hour; To cold Prosperity's strange gaze expose The painful image of unnotic'd woes; Nurse the soft sense that man to man endears, And soothes the sufferer in the vale of tears. Fix'd on this base, our Poet rests his claim, And wooes, in your applause, the voice of fame; On English annals builds historic rhymes, And calls the spirit forth of feudal times; Such, as of old, to Syria's shouting coast Led lion-hearted Richard's Christian host; When England's King the red-cross flag unfurl'd, And darken'd in its shade the Pagan world. Such, as of late, in Heav'n's appointed hour, Gaul's vaunted Idol drove from Acre's tow'r; When Cross and Crescent in just league combin'd, Smote, in his pride, the murderer of mankind: While Albion's naval Hero foremost trod, Scatter'd the Host that scorn'd the living God; And Asia, rescu'd from th'Oppressor's might, Hail'd Allah's name, and crown'd the âChristian Knight.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. WRITTEN BY J. TAYLOR, Esq. And Spoken by MISS MELLON. What an odd creature was this Gallic maid, To seek a cloister's melancholy shade, Whilst a young ardent lover, high in arms, Submissive bow'd before her conqu'ring charms! Grant thee the father would supplant the son, The double vict'ry by her graces won, Should but have fir'd the nymph to take the field, In the proud hope a thousand more might yield: Beauty should gain new laurels every day, And nobly aim at universal sway. Besides, to give some glory to the thing, Her venerable victim was a King; And then how vast the triumph, to ensnare The fam'd gallant of Rosamond the fair! Unhappy Rosamond, whose piteous fate, Love, with a sigh, for ever shall relate! But to our playâThe heroine's case was hard, So oft to wedlock near, so oft debarr'd; And then that meddling priest to intefere When youthful passions urged their fond career, Bid the poor swain to Palestine depart, That he might lose his head as well as heart. Why, if the man had known his place aright, He would not sep'rate lovers, but unite; His duty was to join love's gentle elves, And as to partingâleave it to themselves: Or if there needs another's help, at least, 'Tis bus'ness for the lawyer, not the priest. Nay, had this legate paus'd a week, or so, The spouse might then have been content to go, And rather rush amid the martial strife, Than wage close warfare with a wrangling wife. Well! women must be strangely chang'd, I vow, No girls from lovers fly to convents now; None here will hide in dismal dens from man, But range the world, and conquer all they can. Now to our bardâThe man pretends to say, There's more of truth than fiction in his play; If so, from him avert all hostile aim, And e'en let gossip History bear the blame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. King HenryâMr. Aickin. Prince RichardâMr. Kemble. Prince JohnâMr. Barrymore. Clifford, a son of King Henry by RosamondâMr. C. Kemble. LegateâMr. Cory. OfficerâMr. Maddocks. Adelaide, sister to Philip King of FranceâMrs. Siddons. EmmaâMiss Heard. AbbessâMrs. Coates. Soldiers and Attendants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Chinon in France.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. An Apartment in the Palace. Prince John and Clifford. CLIFFORD. Whence springs this new delay?âFor six long years Has Adelaide been Richard's destin'd bride, Hostage of Peace between the rival nations. Yet some vain subterfuge, some weak excuse, Ever defers the nuptials. PRINCE JOHN. Richard's temper Accords but ill with this protracting policy: I dread the event. CLIFFORD. The sad reverse of fortune That mark'd his last revolt, when, join'd in arms With faithless Philip, his victorious sword Scatter'd our force, might teach our aged monarch Not wantonly to rouse again his fury. Now too, when circled by unnumber'd foes Far from the coasts of EnglandâOur thin squadrons To Richard all attach'd, and only waiting His signal to revolt. PRINCE JOHN. Well you know The jealous spirit of my father's counsels, Ever suspicious of his sons. I fear Some busy tongue has whisper'd to his mind, Too apt to listen to such idle rumours, Doubts of my brother's faith. CLIFFORD. May ruin seize Such turbid spirits, who with doubts distract The peace of human kind!âDisunion now Is fraught with sure destructionâAll our provinces In France will snatch the first pretence to shake Our tottering power. PRINCE JOHN. My father builds his hopes On other groundsâThe church's interference. Philip and Richard, fir'd by youthful ardor, Have vow'd to lead their powers on Asia's plains Against the impious Saracen;âand now A holy Legate, from the Court of Rome, Is every hour expected to demand Their instant aid. Victorious Saladin O'erpowers the Christian forceâwins back their conquestsâ And threatens to display his silver crescent O'er Salem's hallow'd altars. CLIFFORD. Henry never Can be so rash, so lost to every sense Of honor or of prudence, now to suffer His interference to prevail. PRINCE JOHN. Not suffer The full accomplishment of schemes he planned? Frustrate his own designs? I'm much deceiv'd, Or he has us'd his influence to engage The Legate to persist in his demand. CLIFFORD. If this be true, ah! what can be the event But shame and ruin? Tho' the youthful princes Are prompt enough with ardent zeal to follow This meteor of renown, which oft has led Europe's bold sons to distant war, they never At such a moment, when the mingled claims Of glory and of love demand their stay, Will blindly follow Rome's imperious mandate. Some deep mysterious cause must surely urge him To such a rash attempt. PRINCE JOHN. That cause to me Is not so deep a mystery.âThe passions Of Henry are no secretâever ready To catch at beauty's flame. Not jealousy Of Philip's arts, or Richard's rash ambition, Is the true cause of these suspended nuptials; There is another jealousyâfair Adelaide! CLIFFORD. Base and injurious slander!ânot within Loose probability's extremest verge! If Henry's firmer years have felt the power Of beauty's charms too strongly, is it likely, Worn as he is by time, and sad misfortune's Still ruder shocks, which with apparent effort Have min'd the powers of life, he now should throw One thought that way? No! Other cares than love, Ill suited to his years, now rack his bosom. PRINCE JOHN. That I can hardly creditâI, who know How oft his breast has burn'd with lawless passion. The lingering embers of habitual vice Will faintly glow amid the frost of age. How oft his consort, royal Eleanor, Has wept his wandering fancy; while her sons, The generous offspring of a legal bed, Have seen their father's favor basely lavish'd Upon a spurious brood! CLIFFORD. This, sir, to me, Is barely short of insult! Happy were it For Henry's peace, if all his legal sons Had learn'd the pious claims of filial duty From those whom you have censur'd. PRINCE JOHN. You are warm! CLIFFORD. Yes, I avow the charge!âI boast, with pride, A lineage sprung from one of gentle manners, As well as graceful form and noble birth. Nor can I envy, while my fond remembrance Recalls my mother, hapless Rosamond, The turbulent successors of a queen Fierce and ungovernable, whose stern passions Sow'd thorns of sorrow in her husband's bed, And train'd her sons to treason and rebellion!â Your insults I despiseâyet my breast glows With indignation, to behold a son, At such a time, when danger lowers around us, Try to excite confusion by a tale, The most improbable that hell-born malice Could e'er suggest!âI go to cross your schemes, To counteract such artsâas far at least As my weak power avails. I go to keep The few, but valiant, troops that I command, Free from your wiles, and firm in their allegiance! [Exit. PRINCE JOHN , alone. Go and exult in your illustrious birth, And honest follyâThese uncertain hints, Or I am much deceiv'd, will find from Richard A better welcome. His unguarded passions Will catch at once the probable suspicion, And kindle into rage. My mother's arts Have set aside the infant Arthur's claim, And well I hop'd this frantic hero Richard Would leave his bones in Palestine; while I Stood fair for England's throne. This purpos'd marriage May bar my expectationsâ'Tis not Rome Will check his course, while love for Adelaide Inflames his bosomâI must move his fancy To doubt her faithâMy father! Enter King Henry. KING HENRY. I am much Perplex'dâyour doubts alarm meâyet I dread Impetuous Richard's violence, should this marriage Be once again postpon'd. Added to thisâ Is not my faith to royal Philip pledg'd? By solemn treaty pledg'd? PRINCE JOHN. That solemn treaty Deprives you of your crownâFor know, the moment The altar seals the nuptial vows of Adelaide, False Philip join'd with my unnatural brother In impious league, will seize upon your person, And place the crown of England on the brow Of Richard. KING HENRY. Monstrous perfidy! If this Be trueâ PRINCE JOHN. Has ever yet my faith to you Been tainted by the breath of foul suspicion? KING HENRY. Never, my duteous sonâyet these dire tidings, So fatal to my peace, this cruel treachery, Have pierc'd my soul with anguish.âBut, does Philip So poorly deem of England's potent monarch? Is Henry's name in arms so little known, That he can for a moment think I'll yield, Nor strike a blow for freedom and for empire? Rouse all my gallant warriors! We will meet His coward perfidy with manly vengeance. PRINCE JOHN. Where are those gallant warriors! Distant far From England's happy shores and faithful swains, True to their Prince of Egbert's royal lineâ Guarded by doubtful NormansâAll your hope Is to delay these nuptials. KING HENRY. How delay them?â PRINCE JOHN. The Legate. KING HENRY. What of him? PRINCE JOHN. He is, I know, Employ'd by Rome to hasten the departure Of Philip and my brother for the plains Of holy Palestine. And yet, perhaps, Even Rome's commands may not be proof against The arts of their ambition. He may barter The church's interest for the gold of Franceâ Then counteract their schemesâin private second, By splendid gifts and ample promises, The Legate's perseverance. KING HENRY. With reluctance I yield to such a measureâdire necessity Alone compels me.âO my son, beware How you permit your bosom e'er to harbor The demons of ambition.âDid you know The scorpion thoughts that sting a monarch's heart, When base ingratitude, with envious eye Surveys his purest actions, and imputes His best designs to tyranny and pride, You would avoid the splendid load of empire As the worst burthen Heaven can lay on man. [Exit. PRINCE JOHN. Such is the language of a sickly mind Sated with power. My free, undaunted spirit Looks up with eager transport to this burthen, This splendid weight of royalty; nor fears To meet the glorious toil that empire brings. My brother here?â'tis wellânow art assist me. Enter Prince Richard. PRINCE RICHARD. O give my passions wayâmy tortur'd bosom Is torn, is agitated, ev'n to madness! PRINCE JOHN. What has enrag'd you thus? PRINCE RICHARD. Have you not heard?â Henry has found another mean pretence To cross my promis'd nuptials, tho' confirm'd, By solemn oath, between the rival monarchs. PRINCE JOHN. Say on what ground? PRINCE RICHARD. The cause assigned is this. He waits the arrival of the Roman legate; To ratify his right to those dominions Which Philip gives in dower with Adelaideâ Injurious claim!âMust Rome's encroaching priest Thus with our treaties interfere? Shall weâ Shall Europe's independent monarchs suffer Such gross indignity? PRINCE JOHN. But you are bound By holy tiesâyou have assum'd the cross; Till you are freed from those by Rome's decree, You cannot wed. PRINCE RICHARD. Let the proud Roman pontiff Beware how he offends meâI am still, A few short months first to my love devoted, Ready to lead our gallant English troops To check the furious Saracen. If thus He dare insult the champion of the cross, Will Richard draw a sword in such a cause? Confusion!âDo my sufferings move your mirth? PRINCE JOHN. Indeed they do not. Yet I smile to see You turn your anger on the Roman pontiff, When nearer much, perhaps, the real cause Of this delay may lie. PRINCE RICHARD. I'm lost in wonderâ Ten thousand wild conjectures cloud at once My troubled senses. Tell meâinstant tell me, Where your suspicions point. PRINCE JOHN. Enquire no moreâ Perhaps 'tis mere conjecture, and my thoughts Would but distract you. PRINCE RICHARD. Brother, is this well?â Is this a friendly part? Your cooler temper Feels not the whirlwind of tempestuous passion That tears my struggling bosom. PRINCE JOHN. My surmises, Devoid perhaps of truth, might raise that passion To giddy violenceâlet me be silentâ I have said too much already. PRINCE RICHARD. If you know Aught that concerns my peace, at once unfold it. To play thus with my passions, nor becomes A brother nor a friend. Those names are cancell'd If longer you refuse to clear the mystery That hangs on all your words. PRINCE JOHN. When thus adjur'd, Tho' heaven knows how unwillingly, I give The secret councils of my bosom. Know Your Adelaide has charms in other eyes. PRINCE RICHARD. Amazement! It can never be.âWho dares Even cast a look toward herâform even a thought That tends that way? PRINCE JOHN. O there are daring spirits, Who, feeling love's strong influence, will attempt Whate'er that love suggests. PRINCE RICHARD. But let that hero, That daring spirit, guard his bosom well Against my just resentment. By the powers, The awful powers of vengeance, safer might he Snatch from the famish'd pard his prey, than cross My love for Adelaide! PRINCE JOHN. And yetâ PRINCE RICHARD. Yet what? PRINCE JOHN. Perhaps I am deceived; perhaps my fancy Too freely construes what my eye observes. PRINCE RICHARD. Your eye observes?âCurse on your hesitation, Speak out at once, and give me instant ease; Even torture is a bliss to what I feel! PRINCE JOHN. Collect yourselfâbe calmâand I will speak. PRINCE RICHARD. Well, I am calm; proceed. PRINCE JOHN. ThenâI suspect Your father is your rival. PRINCE RICHARD. Ha! my father! PRINCE JOHN. Does that excite your wonder? Is his heart Dead to the power of beauty? He has eyesâ And Adelaide has charms. PRINCE RICHARD. Henry my rival?â It cannot be. Slave as he is to passion, It's wildest stretch of fury ne'er could drive him To such a monstrous thoughtâto sink within him All sense of shameâI never can believe it. PRINCE JOHN. You must be rightâI'm glad you take it thusâ 'Twas only my suspicion, first excited By too officious friendship. Henry's care For your eternal welfare, solely moves him To wait the purpose of the Roman See. We know his pious zeal, his warm attachment To Rome's dominion. PRINCE RICHARD. I am undeceiv'dâ Your words have flash'd conviction on my soul.â And is it thus? Is this the kind return Of love parental for my faithful service? Was it for this, in many a bloody field My daring arm pierc'd thro' Ierne's squadrons, And crown'd his brows with conquest? While these limbs Brav'd in his cause the adverse elementsâ A father reckless of his son, and breaking Vows form'd in the face of Heav'n, violating The sacred laws of hospitality, My dearest rights invaded. It is too much, my agonizing soul Bursts at the thought. PRINCE JOHN. Yet, hear me for a moment. PRINCE RICHARD. O! you have rais'd a tempest in my soul, And every calmer thought is driv'n before itâ Yes, I will have revengeâmy sword shall right meâ The duty of a son, a subject's faith, By this foul deed are void. Had I no friend, No brother, no companion sworn in arms, Who would with generous force oppose such tyranny, And shield my plighted bride?âO torture! torture! Perhaps the fickle fair one yielded up Her easy faith at onceâPerfidious Adelaide! PRINCE JOHN. Restrain yourselfâgive not the rein to furyâ Suspend your violence 'till clearer proof Confirm this tale of guilt. PRINCE RICHARD. What clearer proof Can there be of her falsehood? Had she not Listen'd with pleasure to my father's vows, I should have shar'd her griefâThe horrid tale Conceal'd from me, proclaims her infamy. PRINCE JOHN. Perhaps her timid caution threw a veil Over his base designs, lest indignation Should drive you to some fatal act. PRINCE RICHARD. Such caution Was treason to my love. But here I vow To leave her and these guilty walls for everâ The vile abode of outrage. Triumph, Philip! I come once more to combat on your side. Yet, ere I go, perfidious, cruel maid, I will again behold you, will upbraid you With this unheard-of baseness. PRINCE JOHN. If you prize Your just revenge, your honor, shun, O shun The dangerous interviewâHer syren tears Will shake your firmness. PRINCE RICHARD. What are tears to me! When I have proof of her inconstancy Engraven on my heart, in characters No circumstance can alter. Were she fairer Than love itself could fancyâAh! what fancy Can image beauties fairer than her ownâ She should not dupe the injur'd soul of Richardâ NoâI will scorn her wiles, and proudly tell her I laugh at ties her perjur'd heart has broken.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene, another Apartment in the Palace. Enter Adelaide and Emma. EMMA. Madam, forgive the fond solicitude That on your pensive solitude presumes Thus rashly to intrude. Those plaintive sighs, That look of sorrow, when your dearest wishes Seem plac'd within your reach, awake my wonder. ADELAIDE. Alas! my Emma, tho' the smiles of peace Have smooth'd the rugged front of war, and Richard, My bosom's lord, will soon receive my hand, Given with a father's and a brother's sanction, I feel a load of sorrow on my soul; And my prophetic fears, in spite of reason, Subdue my wearied spirits. EMMA. Thus it happens, That wayward fancy will imagine ills To wound the breast of peace; and when the substance Of real evil is o'ercome, the mind Conjures up shadows of ideal woe. Why turn unthankful from the present good, To fix your eye on visionary forms Of fancied grief. ADELAIDE. Alas! the trembling heart That long has felt the oppressive hand of sorrow, Distrusts each transitory gleam of joy, And doubts the smiles of fortune. O my Emma, Unnumber'd dreadful images of horror Distract my thoughts. Henry's ambitious mind, My brother's restless spirit, and the fire That animates my Richard's ardent temper, Speak to my shuddering breast a thousand dangers, Awake a thousand fears. EMMA. Brave tho' he is, And truly noble, yet I own the warmth Of Richard's passions flames with such impatience, As mocks the guard of reason. ADELAIDE. O! his soul, However fierce, when roused by sense of insult, To me is gentler than the mildest breeze That fans the bloom of Spring. He is all kindness. To thee, my Richard, is my bosom drawn By a resistless force. Thy fame, thy virtues, Even thy defects, are dearer in my eyes Than all the world united. EMMA. Yet his passions Are quick and eager; and when once excited, As uncontroulable as winds and waves, When roars the wintry tempestâEven his love Is mingled with a fervor that alarms me, When I reflect how much your gentle bosom May suffer from it's violence. ADELAIDE. Sometimes I own the same reflections wake my fearsâ Yet, when I see his nobleness of soul, A heart incapable even of a thought That borders on dishonor, and whose feelings The eye at once can read, his faults are lost In the bright radiance of surrounding virtues. Then he redeems his errors with such kindness, Such warm excess of tenderness and loveâ I see you smile, my Emma, at my weakness. EMMA. Madamâthe Princeâ ADELAIDE. Leave me, my gentle friend. [Exit Emma. Enter Prince Richard. PRINCE RICHARD. Am I permitted ere I go for ever, And take a hated object from your sight, To speak a few short words? ADELAIDE. What mean those accents, Faltering and wild, those looks of indignation? What has disturb'd you thus?â PRINCE RICHARD. Perhaps you thought, Because my bosom is not prone to doubt, And where I gave my heart, I also gave My warmest confidence, it was impossible, (Almost indeed it was) that glaring falsehood Could alter my opinion; and you wonder To find your arts could ever be unravell'd, Or I could see when you desired to blind me. ADELAIDE. Is this reproach to me?âHave I deserv'd This mean suspicion?âOn what bold pretence Do you arraign my faith?âSome envious tongue Has blasted my fair fame!âBut let the traitorâ PRINCE RICHARD. Madam, bewareâFor know, the indignation That on the brow of slander'd innocence Shews lovely, and is thron'd in dignity, Speaks in the frown of guilt a harden'd mind, That braves the sense of shame. ADELAIDE. Sir, could I bear This taunt of infamy with brow unruffled, I should by acquiescence give a colour To this unmanly stroke of coward malice. But, by the voice of conscious truth acquitted, I scorn its efforts, and I court the conflict. To the severest test, let malice bring My every actionâPoint one guilty stain To blot my spotless fame, my blameless faith To vows, once breath'd to you, ere frantic passion Thus taught distemper'd jealousy to start At self-created phantoms. PRINCE RICHARD. This is all. Your sex's art, screening your own inconstancy Beneath a lover's weakness, and excusing Your own mean falsehood by the storm of jealousy Excited by that falsehood. Think againâ Search well your inmost soul, and answer truly, If I am not betray'd. ADELAIDE. Noâon my honorâ Not even in thought by me. PRINCE RICHARD. False maid, bewareâ Honor's a sacred name, by which adjur'd Even open guilt, that is not sunk by meanness, Debas'd, as well as profligateâwill pause.â ADELAIDE. This is too much! Have I deserv'd this usage? Knighthood should blush, basely to injure one Without a friend to right her; left an hostage Here among strangersâyet I have a brotherâ Ah no! rash Philip is a rude associate Of your designs. I am aloneâdesertedâ The mock of fortune. PRINCE RICHARD. You the mock of fortune? Is England's monarch then, is potent Henry Become so low as not to have the power To vindicate his mistress? Does that wound you? I see the conscious guilt glow in your faceâ Your blushes speak your falsehood. ADELAIDE. Yesâthe blood, Rous'd by the sense of virtuous indignation, Mounts to my cheek, to hear the base aspersion By cruel malice fram'd. My Lord! My Lord! There needed not this subtle veil of slander To hide your wavering heart. O you were free To follow your own willâyou might have left me, Have gone where proud ambition's gilded trophies, Or newer charms, had lur'd you, and not form'd This wretched scheme, improbable as false, To stain my virgin fame. I was deceiv'dâ I thought that bosom, tho' the slave of passion, Was more the slave of virtue, and could never Harbour a thought that honor disavow'd. How has my heart been frozen oft by terror, When I have pictur'd to myself the dangers That might await your rashness, and have seen you In fancy's eye, borne from the fatal combat A bleeding corse. What are my sufferings now? To view the idol of my adoration, The image of all glory, all perfection, Form'd by my partial love, defac'd, and mangled By this injurious stroke of mean suspicionâ O! 'tis too muchâit rives my tortur'd soul. [Supports herself against the Scene. PRINCE RICHARD. What have I done? My rash impetuous frenzy O'erpowers her gentle frameâI cannot leave her In this distressâhumanity forbids it. Look up, my Adelaide! ADELAIDE. That well known voice Recalls my wandering sensesâBut, alas! Where are the gentle kindness, and affection, That once attun'd each accent of that tongue? You now are anxious to suppose me guilty, And listen to the most unlikely tale That monstrous calumny could e'er invent, With credulous prejudice. PRINCE RICHARD. Howe'er my soul Started with horror at the direful thought Of your inconstancy, you cannot doubt My earnest wish to find you innocent. ADELAIDE. What can my innocence avail, if thus Each groundless doubt enflames your jealousy; And every tale, that busy scandal frames, Condemns me in your eye, while accusation Alone is proof of crimes that trembling nature Sickens to think of. PRINCE RICHARD. O! my Adelaide, Wound not my bosom fartherâdeign to clear This mystery of fate!âMy ear shall drink Each word with dumb attention; and my love Shall turn the scale of justice on your side With partial fondness. ADELAIDE. Such partial fondness I once had claim'd, and gloried in it's cause.â I now should only ask for rigid justice, Could I descend so low as to defend My slander'd innocenceâBut know, my heart Disdains the thought!âIf you suppose me guilty, Is it not worth my slightest care to shew The injurious falsehood?âI forswear your presence!â Enjoy your frantic visions!âyet, when time Shall vindicate my pure, my spotless fame, My faith to you unshaken, then, perhaps, You may, too late, repent the hasty passion That wrong'd me by suspicion! PRINCE RICHARD. O! you wound My heart with piercing anguish!âWill you leave me? Leave me for ever? Not one parting look To chear my dark despair?âAm I your scorn? ADELAIDE. No! though we part for everâfalse and faithless As your misguiding frenzy deems me, yet I'll not conceal my thoughts. Heaven is my witness, My vows to you have ever been inviolate As vestal purity;âand rash, and cruel, As you have been, the weakness of my bosom (O! that I now must call by such a name A passion that was once it's fondest pride) Is still to you devoted; nor can ever Another image fill the aching void. PRINCE RICHARD. O, agony of grief! what angel softness My cruel doubts have injur'd.âAdelaide! You cannot leave me thus. ADELAIDE. What! can you ask me Again to come a voluntary victim To your unjust suspicions? Not alone The feelings of my heartâmy fame, my honor Demand the sacrifice! But time, nor change, Shall ever win me to another's arms.â Let that sufficeâ'tis all that I can promise. PRINCE RICHARD. Behold me at your feet!âMy faltering voice Can scarcely breathe the prayer my soul suggestsâ The imperfect accents die upon my tongue. Turn not away your eyes; nor, cruel, hide The sweet effusion of repentant mercy That swells their moisten'd lids. For pity's sake Tear not my bosom thus! Let not a few, A few unguarded words by madness utter'd, Plunge me in endless misery.âIf ever You really lov'd! ADELAIDE. Alas! that I have lov'd. PRINCE RICHARD. Have lov'd! distracting retrospect of bliss Which my misguided violence has blasted.â And is it past? Am I belov'd no more? Can you pronounce that cruel doom? ADELAIDE. I cannotâ YesâSpite of all the injuries I suffer, The fatal weakness lingers in my breast. PRINCE RICHARD. O call not mercy by so harsh a name! And will you quit me then? ADELAIDE. Ought I to stay? PRINCE RICHARD. Compel me not thus to condemn myself. ADELAIDE. Say what wild start of frenzy could induce you To charge me with a crime of such a dye?â To think that I could listen to the vows Of one, if he were base enough to breathe them, Whom solemn ties of sanctimonious awe Precluded from the thoughtâof Richard's father. PRINCE RICHARD. A love like mineâflaming almost to madness, So often cross'd by danger and delay, Shrunk at the shade of fear.âMy father tooâ The fury of his passions, his rash power Eager to violence.â ADELAIDE. What was his power, His passion, Sir, to me?âIf he could harbour So dire a thoughtâSay what had I to fear? Was I expos'd to danger?âEngland's monarch Is not an Asian despot, nor the sister Of royal Philip, tho' the pledge of peace Between two hostile realms, an eastern slave.â Whose dark suspicion could suggest the thought? PRINCE RICHARD. My brother.â ADELAIDE. O beware his artful wiles.â I would not harshly speak of one who shares Your confidence, or entertain suspicion But on the strongest groundsâYet I must own There is a lowering gloom hangs o'er his brow, A sullenness of aspect, that repels All generous intercourse. PRINCE RICHARD. Yet recollect That Henry still has sought each vain pretence How to elude these nuptialsâthat he only Has yielded to the dread of Philip's power; That even now he is employing arts To bring the Roman Legate to defer Our long expected union.âWeighing this, And knowing how much interest and ambition Should prompt him even to urge our speedy nuptials, Were he not sway'd by some more powerful motive; My long experience of his headstrong passions Which age has yet not weaken'dânever check'd By aught in it's pursuitâall these combin'd Confirm my brother's doubts. ADELAIDE. Awful heaven! If this be soâif those by thee entrusted To guard the rights of others, are the first To violate the nearest ties of natureâ Ah! where shall persecuted innocence Be shielded from oppression? PRINCE RICHARD. Can you pardon The frantic ravings of outrageous passion, That with blaspheming voice presum'd to sully Your spotless innocence? ADELAIDE. Of that no moreâ For we have other caresâAlas! my Richard, Your tidings have alarm'd me.âIf your father Can entertain the purpose you have hinted, Which yet I hardly think, one only way Can shield me from his powerâthe cloister's shelter. PRINCE RICHARD. And are the hopes you gave me sunk already?â Have I but dream'd of bliss? Condemn'd to wake To cruel certainty of lasting woe?â ADELAIDE. I do not mean seclusion from the world By vows irrevocableâAh, I feel My soften'd heart too much to you devoted For heaven to claim it solelyâI will take Protection of the altar for a time, Till kinder stars, and happier hours awaits us.â Oppose me not in thisâ PRINCE RICHARD. Your saintlike virtue Is form'd to soften my too stubborn temperâ You mustâyou shall be mineâthe guardian powers Who watch propitious o'er my country's welfare Will sanctify the union, and my people, When England's throne is to my care entrusted, Shall bless the milder charities that soothe My fiery spirit, and with grateful prayers Pursue the gentler virtues of their Queen. ADELAIDE. Farewell, my Richardâand remember, Adelaide, True to your love, and constant to her vows, Will neither act, or suffer aught unworthy Of Philip's sister, and your destin'd bride. PRINCE RICHARD. Farewell my soul's best treasure, and may angels, Bright as your form, and spotless as your virtue, Watch o'er your steps. [Exit Adelaide. Enter Prince John. PRINCE JOHN. The prelate sent from Rome Is just arriv'd. PRINCE RICHARD. Well, thenâWe now shall see If Rome will obstinately still insist On my rash vow, or be content awhile To wait, 'till first my nuptials are fulfill'd. PRINCE JOHN. The court of Rome will hardly be persuaded Even to postpone this promis'd expedition. When all the Christian world, elate in arms, Are eager to protect the holy towers From Syria's conquering host. PRINCE RICHARD. She must postpone it, Or else the war will want the aid of England. PRINCE JOHN. How will that sound in the astonish'd ear Of all assembled Europe, when around Her, panting warriors croud, and martial rage Beams from each eye, and glows in every breast; While every tongue shall ask, but ask in vain For English Richard?âHe, whose radiant arms Still glitter'd in the dreadful front of battle, And, like a flaming meteor, led his squadrons To victory and fame? PRINCE RICHARD. Spare that reproachâ I am not now to learn a soldier's duty, Or catch the flame of martial emulation From bosoms cold as thine. My ardor yet Has ne'er been faint, when glory bade it blaze. The unwarlike mind, to ease and sloth a slave, May in the silken lap of luxury Slumber away it's honorâbut the heart Fir'd by the generous flame of virtuous love Acquires new courage from the godlike passion, And beauty leads to glory, and to conquest. Yes, Adelaide! from thee my kindling soul Shall catch congenial virtue. Loving thee, I love the abstract of all truth and goodness; And to deserve thee, I must learn to merit True fame's unblemish'd wreath.âNot the extreme Even of punctilious honor, e'er can censure The few short hours I snatch from war and tumult, To seal my nuptial vows. Then, from thy arms, The purest temple of connubial faith, Forth to the field of danger will I rush, A truer champion in the cause of heaven, And proud by deeds of manly hardihood, To prove myself thy knight. PRINCE JOHN. I did not mean To hint suspicion of your well-tried courage, But still the bravest are not safe from slander, Whose poisonous breath will blast the fairest fame, Even on the slightest ground. PRINCE RICHARD. Then let the coward Who wears the semblance of a worth he has not, Shrink at her touch.âFor he whose fame is built On vain opinion only, and but reads His claim to honor in the million's praise, Falls with the baseless pedestal that rais'd himâ But he whose pride is founded on the basis Of conscious worth and self-approving virtue, Despises all the empty sneers of scorn, If by the voice of inborn worth acquitted. Come then, my brother, let us seek this prelate, And try if Rome has insolence to place Her haughty foot on his aspiring head, Who vows to lead her holy force to conquest. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene an Abbey. Enter Adelaide and Emma. ADELAIDE. Ye cloister'd walls, whose solemn gloom excludes The busy tumults of a restless world, Well could I bury in your deep retreat The cares and duties of a court for ever, And give my days to solitude and peace. EMMA. The gloom that hangs around this solemn mansion Obscures your better reason.âSurely, madam, You cannot entertain so sad a purpose, You, who enjoy each gift of rank and fortune, With beauty to enflame a rival world, And a heart open to the warmest feelings Of soft humanity; not form'd to follow The selfish call of lonely meditation, But active in the nobler exercise Of mild benevolence, and social virtue. ADELAIDE. Ah! what can this avail, even if the picture Which thy too partial fancy draws were true? Do passions lead to happiness? The bosom, To each sensation tremblingly alive, Feels but the force of aggravated woe. Why was I born to greatness?âO! my friend, The lowliest village maid, whom humbler fortune Has kindly placed within the happy circle Of joy domestic, feels a thousand comforts That I must never knowâshe has a mother To soothe her in distress; a father's counsel To guide her steps; a brother's arm to right her.â Have I a brother? No!âfor I was torn From every dear connection, and surrender'd A trembling hostage to a foreign court. EMMA. Yet there were hours when royal Adelaide, Tho' bred in England's hostile court, bewail'd not An absent father, and a distant country. ADELAIDE. Ah! why recall those days of fleeting joy, That never must return? 'Tis true, my Emma, There have been hours when your unhappy friend Thought herself truly blestâwhen royal Henry, By every gentle blandishment, assuag'd My rising grief, and, with paternal fondness, Left me no cause to weep a father's absence; Nor could I in my Richard's father see Aught but a parent fonder than my own. But, ah! those scenes are past; and their remembrance Adds only sorrow to my present fate.â That once rever'd, once honour'd parent, now Becomes the fatal object of my fears; While dark suspicion sheds a gloom of doubt O'er all his actions, and each mark of fondness Seems fraught with shame and ruin. EMMA. Madam! see, The King approaches. [Gentlemen, Soldiers. Enter King Henry. ADELAIDE. Royal sir, this honor I did not here expectâI thought these cloisters Secure from interruption. KING HENRY. Why does Adelaide Court solitude and silence? Why prefer The lonely horrors of this sacred mansion To scenes of brighter aspect? ADELAIDE. Ah! the scenes Of gay festivity are little form'd To dress in smiles the pensive brow, or soothe A bosom loaded with oppressive sorrow. KING HENRY. What sorrow wrings your breast? ADELAIDE. Sir! can you ask? Am I not here detained a splendid captiveâ Kept from a brother's arms? KING HENRY. A tie, I hope, Dearer than that of brother, soon will bind you To think yourself our daughter, and our court The centre of your joy. ADELAIDE. It will not stain The modest cheek of virgin purity To own my bosom entertains that wish: But I confess the various strange pretences, By which you still elude the solemn treaty With Philip ratified, and yet refuse To yield me to my brother, move my wonder;â And till that mystery is clear'd, I trust You will not deem me wayward, or capricious, If I seclude my person from your court, And shun your presence. [Exeunt Adelaide and Emma. KING HENRY , alone. What can this portend?â Her words betray mistrust and discontent! She plainly thinks I form some deep design Against her peace and honor.âEach precaution I take against her brother's hot ambition, And Richard's treachery, seems in her eye An outrage to her safety.âHa! my son! Enter Prince John. PRINCE JOHN. I but precede the Legate.âHe has enter'd The abbey gatesâhe comes to seek you hereâ My brother too. KING HENRY. What! Richard with the Legate? PRINCE JOHN. YesâHe has urged him strongly to impart The purport of his mission. This refused, His anxious expectation leads him hither To hear what is resolv'd. KING HENRY. His heady violence Distracts my inmost soul.âO! that his breast Possess'd that steady calm, that filial reverence, That marks your words and actions. PRINCE JOHN. Royal sir, It is my pride, my happiness, to shew My duty to your ordersâWould to heaven My life could buy your peace!âAlas! I fear My brother. Yetâ KING HENRY. Why that mysterious pause? PRINCE JOHN. How can I speak? I do not wish to raise Suspicion in your mindâand yet your safetyâ KING HENRY. I charge you by the duty of a son, Which you have ever kept inviolate, Disclose your thoughts. PRINCE JOHN. Your wishes, sir, to me Are absolute commandsâall other cares Yield to the stronger claims of filial duty.â Know, then, impetuous Richard is determin'd, Should Rome refuse to free him from his vow, To quit these walls, and, join'd in arms with Philip, Again renew the war. KING HENRY. Accurs'd effect Of lawless lust of power!âAlas! my life Has been a scene of troubleâpersecuted By jealousy of an imperious wife, And her rebellious sons;âyet thou art true, Thy faithful breast alone receiv'd no spark Of thy stern mother's violence. PRINCE JOHN. My lord, Behold, the Legate comes. Enter the Legate attended, Prince Richard, and Clifford. KING HENRY. Holy father, With reverence that becomes the delegate Of Rome's imperial pontiff, I receive Your sacred mission, and with due obedience Await his awful mandate.âDoes he suffer These long protracted nuptials to proceed? LEGATE. Your son to other duties is devotedâ The cause of heaven demands him. He is bound By ties superior to all worldly claimsâ The church expects him now to head her legions. PRINCE RICHARD. Behold me ready to obey her summons!â I only ask a transitory respite, To solemnize my plighted faith to Adelaide. LEGATE. Altho' the church approves connubial ritesâ Nay, sanctifies their forms, they must not clash With her immediate interests. PRINCE RICHARD. I am not The slave of sensual appetiteâthese nuptials Are on no private interest urged.âI own The powerful charms of Adelaideâher beautyâ And yet superior virtues fire my soul. I own myself her slaveâyet fond affection Is not the only or the strongest motive.â Two rival nations look with anxious eyes To see a union which, in common welfare, Shall blend their jarring interests. LEGATE. What's the welfare, The temporal interests of united Europe To injur'd heaven?âBehold the sacred fields By deluges of martyrs' bood ennobled, Now desolate and waste, o'er-run by infidels, Who spoil the temples and pollute the altars Rear'd to a present Deity!âBehold The outstretch'd arm of vengeance now prepar'd To strike the blow vindictive!âShall thy hand Arrest the awful bolt?âMy son, my son, Let not delusive dreams of patriot zeal Deceive your fancy; nor beneath the shew Of public virtue hide the selfish passions Enflam'd by female art! PRINCE RICHARD. Insulting priest, I tell thee the pure flame that fires my breast, By virtue fann'd, is what thy grosser sense Feels not even in idea! [To King Henry] Sir, can you Permit this sanction'd hypocrite to slander The virtues of a Princess you are bound By duty and by honor to protect? KING HENRY. You go too far by such injurious words To stain the reverend delegate of heaven. Such insults unaton'd may draw upon us, And on our guiltless subjects, the displeasure Of Rome's thrice holy see. PRINCE RICHARD. 'Twere well for Europe Had she never suffer'd Rome's presumptuous priests To interfere, or guide her various interests, While on our easy faith she builds her greatness, And rears her empire on the neck of kings.â But, sir, I wish the holy pontiff joy Of his new convert.âFor the time has been You were not quite so zealous in his service; And when you found the growing power of Rome Cross'd your designs, you mark'd your indignation Even by her servant's bloodâand Becket's murder Stands in the sacred legends of the church A witness of your violence.âBut when The reverend squadrons combat on your side, Tho' in a causeâ LEGATE. Rash youth, forbearânor thus Arraign the pious councils of the church, On love and mercy founded, nor presume To execrate a crime that she has pardon'd.â Tho' dreadful was the deed, the guiltless blood Of martyr'd Becket has been expiated By solemn rites of penitence and prayer. PRINCE RICHARD. By gold and by corruption, rather say; For which you not alone sanction the crimes Of sacrilege and murder; but your voice, With prostituted breath, abets the cause Of future violence, and sanctifies Incest and perfidy! LEGATE. I'll hear no more Of this rude profanation!âBut, young man, Mark what I say, and tremble.âIn the name Of Rome's high sovereign pontiff, whose decrees The Christian world obeysâI will pronounce Your nuptials void, if you presume to celebrate The interdicted rite, before your vow To heaven is satisfied. PRINCE RICHARD. Thou dar'st not do it! LEGATE. Not dare! Proud Prince, that will be instant seen. Within these walls I reign supreme. If once I give the order, here shall Adelaide Remain the altar's votaryâfrom thy sight And hopes, cut off for ever. PRINCE RICHARD. Presumptuous slave! First this avenging arm Shall free mankind from your insulting tyranny. [Draws his sword, but is disarmed. KING HENRY. Disarm his headstrong rage! CLIFFORD. My lord, consider The consequence of this your rash attemptâ Forbearâwhat honor can your vengeance gain Against a priest unarm'd? LEGATE. O let his rage Spend all it's idle force.âBy sanctity Fenc'd and protected, I defy his threats. PRINCE RICHARD. Thank not your vaunted sanctity, but those Whose friendly force my lifted arm prevented, And gave me time to think.âBut 'tis enoughâ I ne'er was recreant in the lists of glory, Nor have I when my honor stood engaged, Much more my solemn faith, shrunk from the conflict; But ere my sword shall thus be proudly forc'd To wage a war from which my injur'd heart Now turns with indignation, I will throw it For ever from my grasp. [To the King] Sir, you may glory In this your proud allyâThe time may come When you shall feel his insolence, and mourn The rash resolve that tempted you to raise The usurpation of a foreign power To lord it o'er your own, your people's rights.â For me, I bend not to his iron yoke, But fly indignant your dishonor'd court.â And, haughty prelate, know the hour approaches, When thou, and thy proud master, shall repent The exercise of this officious zeal. [Exit. KING HENRY. He's strangely agitated.âMuch I fear Some dread event from his ungovern'd rage. Follow, my son, and try to calm his passions. [Prince John goes out after his brother, and the rest on the opposite side of the stage. Scene the outside of the Abbey. Re-enter Prince Richard and Prince John. PRINCE RICHARD. Why do you follow me? PRINCE JOHN. I come to soothe Your ardent grief, to mitigate your woes, By friendship's lenient balm. PRINCE RICHARD. Not all the powers Of friendship, or of love, can soothe a mind Tortur'd like mineâstung by repeated insult. My only hope is vengeance! That alone, Tempts me to bear this hated load of life.â Ungrateful Henry!âWhen I led your armies, I led them on to certain victoryâ They have beheld me in the hostile front Of adverse squadronsâthey have felt my arm, And shrunk beneath the stroke.âOnce more I'll bear My courage, and my fortunes to your foeâ Again my arms shall shine with dreadful radiance In the bright van of Gallia's rival host.â Philip will not refuse to own my wrongs, But crown my service with its dearest hope, And give his lovely sister to my wishes. PRINCE JOHN. What will avail you aught the gift of Philip, While Adelaide remains in Henry's power? PRINCE RICHARD. True, but her heart is mineânor dare he force Her present sanctuaryânow too guarded With greater reverence by the Legate's presence. PRINCE JOHN. The Legate may be biass'd.âWe have seen How interest and ambition sway his influence. He may be brought to sanction violence As well as perfidyâand for the heart Of Adelaideâ PRINCE RICHARD. 'Twere sacrilege to doubt itâ She is all truth, all constancy, all virtue. PRINCE JOHN. It may be so, perhapsâBut thro' the medium Of fond affection's partial eye, her merits May shine with heighten'd lustre.âMy opinion Of female virtue is not quite so sanguineâ Nor do I know the constancy so rooted, As not to yield before the immediate prospect Of wealth and power. PRINCE RICHARD. O banish from your heart The demon of suspicion, whose foul breath Poisons each generous thought; your vain surmises Had nearly blasted all my hopes, and led me To doubt the kindest, and the purest love That ever warm'd the breast of truth and beauty. He who believes no virtue can resist Self-interest and ambition, shews himself A slave to both. PRINCE JOHN. That undeserv'd reproach Wounds not my conscious truthâBe this the test. If you are really lov'dâif her whole heart Is to your wish devotedâif the passion That Henry entertains is hateful to her, And that the dazzling charms of proffer'd greatness Sway not her resolutions, she must know The abbey's walls yield but a weak defence. Paint all her dangers to her, and persuade her To join your flight, and seek her brother's court, As the sole means of safety and protection. If she refuse this proofâif here she stay, Trusting to Henry's power, whatever reasons Her sophistry may urge, his suit is not So dreadful to her feelings as she feigns. PRINCE RICHARD. I see the horrors of her situation, And doubt not her compliance.âAh! too well I know the fervor of my father's passions, When rous'd by love or interest. Adelaide, You shall partake my fortunesâI will place Your present danger in so strong a light, That you must be persuaded, must forsake These fatal cloisters for your brother's court, And the protection of a lover's arms. Say, will you share my hazards? PRINCE JOHN. In your enterprise With ardor I embarkâYet let me pauseâ Perhaps 'twere prudent not to join you now. Here I may do you better serviceâClifford, That bastard scyon from my father's stock, Is to his cause strongly attach'dâHis courage And courteous manners make him popular, And the few English troops he here commands Are all at his devotion. I will try To lure them from their chief, and win them over To your designs. When this I have effected, I will avow myself, and boldly stand The warm avenger of my brother's wrongs. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene a Court before the Palace. Prince John alone. PRINCE JOHN. Thus far my schemes have prosper'd: Adelaide I know will never be induc'd to join The hasty flight of Richardâthat refusal Renews his jealousy, and turns his love To deadly hatred.âSoftâis that so certain? The earnest suit of Richard, and those doubts Of Henry's purpose which my art suggested, May work upon her fears. She must be stopp'd. And see where Clifford comesâhis honest zeal Shall be the engine of my purpose. Enter Clifford. Clifford! In happy hour you come; your friendly counsel And generous aid are wanted.âO I grieve To see the promis'd harvest of our hopes Blasted so soon.âThe demon of dissention Now stalks again at large. CLIFFORD. The legate's pride, And Henry's blind compliance with his wishes, Have rais'd a tempest that will pour its fury On our distracted country. PRINCE JOHN. Yes, my friend, I am bewilder'd in the maze of dangers That lie on every side: but most I fear My brother's violenceâI know he meditates A new revolt. CLIFFORD. Cannot your words prevent him? You have his confidence. PRINCE JOHN. You might as well Counsel the waves to silence when the tempest Sweeps o'er the boiling ocean, as persuade His bosom to be calm when the fierce gust Of sudden passion heaves it.âMuch I fear He will not quit alone his father's court. He means to bear the lovely Adelaide To Philip's camp, companion of his flight. But this must be prevented.âShe an hostage, We may make terms with her impetuous brother, Who else, by Richard aided, threatens ruin To our o'er-number'd force.âBe it your care To watch the abbey walls that she escapes not. [Exit. CLIFFORD. Yes, artful Princeâand I will watch thee too; For much I doubt that thy insidious wiles Have caus'd this fatal change. The breast of Richard, You say, is torn by passion!âbut whose breath, By false insinuation, rais'd the tempest, And blew it into madness? O'er our heads Destruction hangs; and those whose timely care Might stay the impending storm, sway'd by interest Or blind revenge, precipitate its fall. One only chance remains.âI'll try at least To undeceive the King, whose easy breast Perfidious John has poison'd.âIf his fix'd, His partial fondness for him, makes him scorn My honest counsel, I discharge my duty To my misguided Prince and injur'd country. [Exit. Scene the Abbey. ADELAIDE alone. Each ray of hope is lostâI find the Legate Refuses to release my gallant Richard From his rash vow.âOur nuptials are postpon'dâ Perhaps for ever!âThe events of battle Who can foresee!âBesides, imperious Henry May force me from the cloisters.âNoâthere is One path that leads to safetyâIf I see Aught that appears like violence, the altar Shall be my refugeâI'll devote myself By vows irrevocable, and assume The holy veil.âO heavens, the prince! Enter Prince Richard. PRINCE RICHARD. My life, my lovely Adelaide! We are undone, inevitably ruin'd.â My father has prevailedâCorrupted Rome Abets his schemesâit is resolv'd to part us. ADELAIDE. Alas! I am not to learn the fatal tidings, I am inform'd of all. PRINCE RICHARD. And must we part? ADELAIDE. The thought is deathâyet what alternative? PRINCE RICHARD. To fly. ADELAIDE. Impossible! PRINCE RICHARD. What! shall I sit The pointed mark for injury and insult To shoot their arrows at?âtamely behold The best, the dearest rights of human nature By sacrilegious insolence invaded, And, with the patient meekness of a hermit, Bow to the stroke, and kiss the hand that wrongs me? Not such my temper.âNoâI have resolv'd Instant to fly from these ungrateful walls, And join your brother's armsâhe will receive The injur'd friend that Henry has abandon'd, Espouse my cruel wrongs, and give me vengeance; And from his hand I shall receive those charms My father's shameless perfidy denies me.â Why droops my love? ADELAIDE. Your rash resolve alarms meâ Have you consider'd well, maturely weighed Each consequence of this wild enterprise? PRINCE RICHARD. I have.âThe Norman troops are all to me Firmly devoted; and the English warriors, In numbers weak, and more than half, my friends. Fear not, my love, this arm even from the shadow Of danger shall protect you. ADELAIDE. Ah, my Richard! Your sanguine hopes deceive youâthere are dangers From which no force, no numbers can protect us. PRINCE RICHARD. These are the coinage of your timid fancyâ Phantoms of fear. ADELAIDE. Phantoms of fear! O Richard, Are all the sacred duties of our life, The charities of love, the claims of virtue, But merely phantoms? Say, are all the precepts With care imprinted on our infant bosoms, Which mark alone, or which should mark alone, The pride of birth, the dignity of station, Are these delusions allâthe mere inventions Of human art, of prejudice and error? Is there no fear but what endangers life?â Is to preserve a miserable being, Debas'd by servile infamy, degraded By self-condemning conscience, all our care? PRINCE RICHARD. What action of my life has given you cause To deem my heart could entertain a thought Of such unworthy meanness? ADELAIDE. Noâmy soul Acquits you of the charge.âI know your heart Is truly noble, and when clear reflection Dispels the mists that cloud your better reason, Will still pursue the shining track of virtue. Look to the fields of glory, where your arm Has turn'd the scale of many a bloody day, And ask if conquest came without a conflict. Who gains a trophy from a foe unarm'd? Nor lie in camps alone the lists of honor. O there are combats harder than the field's, Where the insidious foe betrays within; And he whose coward virtue only triumphs When not assail'd by trial and temptation, Is not true honor's servant. While from the shadow of disgrace you fly, You run to meet the substance. PRINCE RICHARD. Meet I not The substance hereâdoes not her horrid form Glare in my starting eyes where'er I turn?â Here is her dire abode, and to avoid The baleful object, I must fly these walls. ADELAIDE. Let not the enfuriate demons of revenge Impose upon your senses, and assume The specious form of honor. PRINCE RICHARD. Just revenge Is sanctified by honor, which without it Becomes a lifeless mass. ADELAIDE. But who shall judge When our revenge is just?âNot the swoll'n bosom Inflam'd by recent injury.âRevenge Alone is just when in impartial hands; But there are situations which disarm Even justice of her swordâNo private wrong Should cancel duties that we owe our country; No insult arm a son against a father. PRINCE RICHARD. Such injuries as mine, nature revolts at, And feels in such a strife her laws suspendedâ My country will espouse my cause. ADELAIDE. For which, In friendly gratitude, you'll rashly plunge her In all the miseries of civil war. But for a moment place the dreadful scene Before your eyes.âThink onlyâ PRINCE RICHARD. I can think Of nothing but of thee, and the dread horrors To which I leave theeâThat shall never be! The thought is madnessâLet us fly together. ADELAIDE. Noâif my prayers, my reasoning are too weak, To turn you from your purpose, lead you back To the deserted paths of fame and duty, I will be true to what I owe myself. PRINCE RICHARD. Heavens! do I hear you right?âDo you refuse To share my sinking fortune?âWere your vows Of endless faith, unshaken constancy, Breath'd to the winds? ADELAIDE. O do not wrong me thusâ The powers of earth and heaven can witness for me, There's no extreme of wretchedness and want, I would not share with youâOn the bare earth, Expos'd to all the warring elements, Sure of your love, and proud of conscious innocence, I were supremely blestâ But ah! to feel myself the vile associate Of infamy and viceânay, more, the causeâ It is a price too great to purchase all This world can giveâto purchase even your love. PRINCE RICHARD. And add, my happiness, my life.âAlas! What do I say? they are no longer dear To AdelaideâI am belov'd no more. ADELAIDE. Belov'd no more!âAnd do my weeping eyes, My agitated bosom, speak indifference? But, ah! what love can last that is not founded On virtue and esteem?âYour own cool judgment, The raging storm of passion once subsided, Would even despise me, curse the hated cause, That, like a wandering meteor, led your steps From honor's path, And hate the partner of your infamy. PRINCE RICHARD. Hate thee!âBy heaven, tho' now my laboring fancy Forms such dire images as almost lead me To doubts of horror, you engross my soulâ Thought cannot paint the ardor of my passionâ I love you even to torture.âCan it beâ Can such a perfect form inherit falsehood? ADELAIDE. That mean insinuation would offend me, Did not my soul partake the bitter anguish That wrings your bosom. PRINCE RICHARD. And you pity me.â Ah! what, alas! is unavailing pity To a distracted wretch you will not save!â You talk of love and fondness, yet you see me 'Whelm'd in a deep abyss of misery, And will not stretch a friendly arm to save me. ADELAIDE. Yes, I would save youâsave your peace, your honor. PRINCE RICHARD. What! by the ruin of my fondest hopes, The shipwreck of my love?âFor, in my absence, Henry perhapsâ ADELAIDE. Am I so mean an object, So sunk in men's opinions, that he dare To offer violence to Philip's sister? PRINCE RICHARD. By passion urg'd, and sure of present power, The feeble image of a distant danger Will vanish from his thoughtâWhat shall defend Your innocence from violence?â ADELAIDE. Myselfâ My own determin'd will. PRINCE RICHARD. We easily Despise a danger which we do not fear. I see my folly now, that strove to wake A sense of terror in a faithless woman Of what she wishes, and who now despises The wretched object of her former love, When plac'd in competition with a crown. ADELAIDE. Eternal powers! have I deserv'd this usageâ This cruel imputation? PRINCE RICHARD. Your own heart Must answer, yesâEven now your looks betray The secret of your heart.âPerfidious maid Tho' now to quit you rends my tortur'd heart stringsâ Degenerate weakness down, nor let a tear Bedew my burning cheekâI tear myself For ever from your presenceâbut, beware My unexpected vengeance does not come To interrupt your joys. [Exit. Enter Emma. EMMA. I met the Prince In cruel agitation.âDearest Madam, What dire event?âAlas! you seem disorder'd. ADELAIDE. Emma, I am undone, for ever wretched, Beyond imagination wretched!âdoom'd To misery and woe.âThis dreadful struggle Is too severe, I feel myself unequal To bear the dreadful conflict. EMMA. Let me share Your grief, and lighten, by the voice of friendship, This weighty load of sorrow. ADELAIDE. While my tongue Pleaded the cause of duty, that idea Aroused my firmnessânow 'tis past, and nought Appears around me but a night of horror, Scorn'd and deserted by the man I loveâ O! Richard, must I never see thee more? Is there no hope, no prospect?âWhere's the Legate?â Perhaps my tears, my sufferings, may induce him To change the rigor of the Roman edictâ Where is he?âSayâ EMMA. Alas! your hopes from him, I fear, are groundless.âHe is with the king, Who, as Prince John inform'd me, now solicits A dispensation from the rites that bound him To Eleanor his consort, with intent To marry you himself. ADELAIDE. O! monstrous effort Of passion unrestrain'd!âThen all the hopes With which I fondly propp'd my drooping mind Are vanish'd to the windsâmy dreams of happiness In this vain world are over, and I fall A sacrifice to virtue.âHeaven, who knows The pureness of my heart, accept my vows! For to the sad protection of the altar I fly, from Henry's powerâI fly!âalas! That such a flight must beâfrom love and Richard. For to my bosom, to my beating bosom, In spite of all his rash injurious doubts, His dear idea clings and makes this struggle Worse than the stroke of death!âI will not think! Richard! I now devote me to the altar, Rather a victim of thy groundless jealousy Than fear of Henry!âCome, my gentle Emma, And hear me breathe the irrevocable vow! [Exeunt. Scene, Apartment in the Palace. KING HENRY alone. I have been ill advis'dâonce more, I fear The fatal flames of discord will be kindled. I feel the hand of time, by trouble strengthen'd, Bear hard upon meâI have not the powers That firmer years, and brighter scenes, once gave me, To crush the pride of a rebellious son, And an unsteady people. Enter Prince John. PRINCE JOHN. Sir, I grieve To wound your ear with the unhappy taleâ But my intemperate brotherâ KING HENRY. What new stroke Of fate awaits me?âspeak! PRINCE JOHN. To madness stung By the decision of the Legate, Richard Has left this city, and is fled towards Paris. KING HENRY. Where were my troops?âWhat! did they idle stand, And let the traitor pass? PRINCE JOHN. I grieve to say That you have been betray'd!âThe Norman horse Revolted with him;âall the rest hung down Their heads in sullen silence, nor would act Against a hero who so oft had led them. KING HENRY. Base and degenerate cowards!âBut my vengeance Shall overtake your treachery.âBid my band, My faithful band of England's gallant knights, Arm and to horse!âMyself will lead them on To scourge these renegades.âIt will not beâ Alas! my fainting spirits sink beneath The weight of grief and age; my feeble arm Shrinks from it's purposeâO! my son, my son, Lend me thy aid. PRINCE JOHN. Have courage, sir, revive, Entrust to me your vengeance; let me lead Your warriors to the field. KING HENRY. It shall be so.â Go to my faithful English, rouse their rage Against these recreant traitors. PRINCE JOHN. Sir, perhaps They may dispute my orders. KING HENRY. Take this signet, They will obey that token.âHaste, my son, Lead them to the pursuit, and bring in chains These base deserters of their Prince and country. [Exit Prince John. KING HENRY , alone. I feel the heavy load of fate press on me, And bend me to the earth.âThese starts of passion O'erpower my waining strengthâmy failing years Are to my will unequal.âWhere are now My friends, my children, who with lenient care Should soothe the lapse of age!âO, Richard! Richard! Hast thou forgot the tears of penitence That flow'd from Henry's eyes, what time he warn'd thee, With dying accents warn'd thee, to avoid The crime of filial disodebience, which His latest hours embitter'd.âJohn alone, Of all the issue of proud Eleanor, Retains his duty.âBut here comes my Clifford, The blooming offspring of a gentler race, Sprung from my lov'd, my murder'd Rosamond! Whose tried fidelity and gentle manners, Endear him to my heart. Enter Clifford. KING HENRY. O! come, my Clifford, And let me pour the sorrows of my soul Into your gentle bosom!âYou, perhaps, You too will join with Richard, and forsake me.â Ingratitude's the age's vice! CLIFFORD. O! sir, Endear'd to me by every hallow'd tieâ My king, my masterâShall my voice presume To add a nobler, and a dearer name?â My ever lov'd, my ever honor'd father, If e'er this heartâ KING HENRY. My Clifford, say no more, I cannot doubt thy truthâThe gentle candor, The ingenuous softness of thy beauteous mother, Beam in thine eyes.âForgive my wayward fancy, For, Clifford, I am press'd by many cares, And need thy friendly counsel. CLIFFORD. Will your ear Endure the honest voice of serious truth? KING HENRY. O freely speak the dictates of thy heart, I now can bear adviceâcan bear even censureâ The days of pride and insolence are gone, Fled with my youth and my prosperityâ My lofty spirit vails it's towering pride Beneath the iron hand of hard affliction. CLIFFORD. I will not cloath my free opinion, sir, In terms of insolence, nor harshly urge Memory of errors pastâBut, might my counsel Be heard with favor, Richard should be sought With gentle words and terms of reconcilement. KING HENRY. What!âbow myself to my rebellious son!â CLIFFORD. I do not wish to cloath my thoughts with aught That sounds even like upbraidingâYet, forgive me, When I request you but to ask yourself If he has not been injur'd. KING HENRY. O! you probe My bosom to the quickâI hardly dare Even ask myself that question.âYet, what's that To his high crimes?âSay I have been to blameâ Is that a cause for treason and rebellion?â I must, I will have vengeance. CLIFFORD. Ah! how can you? The troops that fled with Richard, when united With Philip's numerous host, and bearing with them The fame in arms of their brave leader, leave you No prospect of success. Remember, sir, You are not now on England's sea-girt shore, Fenc'd from all danger by the guardian Ocean, O'er which she reigns supreme. Nought but a weak, And ill-defended frontier, here protects you From the fierce inroad of a faithless people, And an indignant monarch. KING HENRY. You're deceiv'dâ Long ere my rebel son can join with Philip, He'll learn to fear my vengeance.âWarlike John, Now leads my English horse in close pursuit: He will o'ertake the treacherous fugitives, And bring them back in triumph. CLIFFORD. Have you given Prince John the power to lead the valiant troop Of English knights that I commanded? KING HENRY. Yesâ He has my signet to enforce obedience. CLIFFORD. O! sir, recall that trustâ KING HENRY. It is too lateâ They are already on the marchâYou look With sorrow and amazement. CLIFFORD. Royal sir, If I have still been faithfulâif this arm Has ever done you true and loyal service, If now you prize your honor and your safety, Let me this instant follow him, and try What mild and lenient measures will effect, Ere it be yet too late. My troubled mind Forebodes some fatal issue. KING HENRY. Why this quick This strange alarm?âJohn is of cooler temper, Not rash and hasty, like his fiery brother. CLIFFORD. Ask me not what I fear, or what I knowâ I would not wish to plant another thorn Within a breast already too much woundedâ But trust me once, and let me fly, if possible, To close this dreadful breach. KING HENRY. What can you do? What terms propose, that shall not shake at once My honor and my power?â CLIFFORD. By all that's sacred On earth and heaven, let me conjure you, quit Your ill-plac'd jealousyâPersuade the Legate To let the holy rites proceed, and give Fair Adelaide to Richard's eager wishes. KING HENRY. You are not yet aware of half the dangers That wait those nuptialsâMy revolted son With Philip leaguedâ CLIFFORD. O! sir, you have a foe Nearer than Philip, who with serpent tooth Preys on the parent breast that fosters him. Detain me not a momentâOn my knees Let me entreat your confidenceâtrust me now, And let me save you, tho' I perish. KING HENRY. There is a mystery in all you sayâ Explain yourself more clearly. CLIFFORD. All, in time Will fully be explain'dâthe present moment Admits not of delay. KING HENRY. Then go, my Cliffordâ To your discretion and fidelity I trust the event. CLIFFORD. And may I prosper only As I am true to you. My lord, farewell; And may I meet you soon with happier prospects. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene the Abbey. Adelaide, in a religious habit. ADELAIDE. My vows are seal'd to heavenâeternal oaths, Breath'd with religious zeal, have shut me now For ever from the world, and 'tis in vain To throw one look behind meâYet, my Richard, My lingering heart still breathes a sigh for theeâ It must not beâI will subdue the force Of it's rebellious feelings, and devote My thoughts alone to heaven. Enter Emma. Come, my Emma, Thy presence shall assist my weak resolves. The bosom still will cling to some lov'd object, And friendship may, without offence, survive The cloister's silent tomb. EMMA. I hope to gild Your grief with brighter prospectsâYou may yet Be free, be happy. ADELAIDE. NeverâI am now Securely shelter'd from the gusts of fortune In this still harbor.âShall I venture forth To try again the various storms that wait To wreck the votaries of a troubled world?â Besidesâmy solemn vows are now recorded In the irrevocable doom of heaven; Nor can I, if I would, evade their forceâ Or could they be revok'd, the injurious wrongs Of Richard's doubts and Henry's lawless passionâ EMMA. You have been much deceiv'dâboth been deceiv'dâ The wiles of Johnâ ADELAIDE. Ah! my prophetic fears Were then too just.âMy heart ever mistrusted His dark reserveâProceed my friend. EMMA. His arts, Beneath the mask of friendly care, instill'd A mutual jealousy between the King And his too hasty sonâThis, Clifford now Has to my ears impartedâHe is gone, By Henry's special order, to bring back Misguided Richard. ADELAIDE. That is now too late!â Why did my rash precipitation drive me To breathe the fatal vow which has cut off My hope of joy for everâYet, why mourn The only step that could ensure my peace?â O I were weak indeed again to trust My future happiness to the wild passions Of one, who thus, by causeless doubt alarm'd, Threw me with scorn, an outcast from his bosom. Enter King Henry. KING HENRY. Start not, my Adelaide, nor think I come A bold intruder here; for in my heart, My wounded heart, I feel, alas! too strongly A sense of former injuries to thee And my revolted son.âYou turn away Your eyes indignant. ADELAIDE. Sir, the stormy passions Of scorn, and of resentment, ill become A mind devoted to the meek profession Of peace and resignation. KING HENRY. That reflection Redoubles all my sorrows.â'Twas the frenzy Of my rash jealousy, that drove your innocence To this retreat; but you may yet be happy, My son may still be your's, and those mild eyes Beam peace and safety on discordant nations, And heal the wounds this fatal day has given To my distracted house. ADELAIDE. It cannot be. Were I, tho' that's impossible, set free From these my sacred vows, your son, alas! Could never be my choice.âThe injurious treatmentâ KING HENRY. My Adelaide, you are too good, too just, To let my errors fall on hapless Richard. They rous'd his jealousy. ADELAIDE. That is past, Irrevocably pastâit matters little From whom my misery aroseâmy vows Are now beyond recall. KING HENRY. Think not so, They may be cancell'dâRome has ample power, As well as will, to serve me.âWhere's the Legate? I did expect him here. ATTENDANT. The Legate now Is in the abbey, sir, and waits your pleasure. KING HENRY. O bid him quickly enter.âLovely Adelaide Retire awhile.âI hope this interview Will seal your peace. ADELAIDE. I shall await the event.âTho' of the hope For other peace, than solitude and prayer Can give within these walls, I feel no presage. [Exeunt Adelaide and Emma. Enter the Legate. LEGATE. My lord, I come to rouse your tardy zeal.â Where are the troops, the warlike preparations, That Richard is to head against the infidels?â All Europe now is warm in expectation, England alone excepted. KING HENRY. Holy father, I fear our hopes are blighted in the bud. The youthful warrior who should lead my troops To Philip is revolted, and with him, Threatens our safety.âI have now no force For distant war, happy if I can guard My own dominions from their arms. LEGATE. Fear not, I will protect them. For if royal Philip Presume to join in Richard's rash rebellion, Or form designs against a realm, whose arms Are now devoted to our common cause, I will denounce the church's vengeance on him. And, should he pertinaciously persist, Turn the collected force that's now assembled, On him and his adherents. KING HENRY. Yet, perhaps, There is a milder way to calm this tempest, And give the nation peace. LEGATE. Name it, my lord. O Heaven forefend, we e'er should have recourse To violence, when gentler means are offer'd, Or speak in terror, when the seraph voice Of mercy may be heard. KING HENRY. Then thus, my lord. Absolve the royal virgin from her vows, Breath'd in rash haste, and for a time dispense With Richard's service, 'till his promis'd nuptials With Adelaide are over. LEGATE. Think not of itâ It cannot be. KING HENRY. Yet hear me. Suffer not Intemperate zeal, with over weening haste To hurt the sacred cause it would support. You now can have but a divided force. Consent but to these nuptials, and defer For a short space the warâthat time elaps'd, England and France united, 'neath the banners Of my victorious son, shall to it's basis Shake the proud throne of Saladin. LEGATE. Your purpose Is strangely alter'd since we last convers'd. But tho' these fickle wav'rings of the mind, May suit, perhaps, with temporal concerns, The will of heaven is permanent, and bends not To the weak changes of capricious man. KING HENRY. You will not then accede to my proposal?â LEGATE. Neverâit cannot beânay, urge me not. KING HENRY. Curse on my crooked policy, that first Invok'd your aid, and made myself your slave. O Adelaide! O Richard! O my children! My cruel perseverance has undone you, For I have arm'd a ruthless power against you, And try in vain to shield you from it's fury. But know, insulting priest! I will not suffer Myself, my injur'd children, and my people, To reap the bitter fruits my hand has sown. I will appeal to England's laws, which oft Have check'd the encroachments of your haughty pontiff; They shall annihilate these impious vows, And join the hands of Adelaide and Richard. LEGATE. I smile with scorn at such unmeaning threats. You and your frantic islanders will dare To break these vows?âAttempt it, and that moment I publish Rome's anathema against you, And your rebellious people. Fartherâshould you With sacrilegious insolence presume To solemnize these nuptials, and unite Your son with a recluseâyour bleeding realms, While a foul brand lies on their spurious race For ages, shall lament the dire effects Of a contested, and unfix'd succession. And now, my lord, farewell, to your own counsels, And your obedient sons, I leave the event. [Exit. KING HENRY. This is, alas! the fatal consequence Of my appeal to Rome. The dreadful weapon Is turn'd against myselfâThus is it ever With those who would accomplish rash designs By evil meansâO never let the mind Of manly firmness seek to gain it's purpose By means that honor turns fromânor a monarch Basely submit his own, his people's rights, To the decisions of a foreign power. Enter Clifford. Clifford!âReturn'd alone?âHave you succeeded? Do you bring peace?âYour brow, alas! portends Some dreadful tidingsâspeakâWhere are my sons? Say, did you come in time to check the fury Of John's attack? CLIFFORD. There was no causeâthe princes Met without violence. KING HENRY. 'Twas as I thoughtâ Did I not augur right?âDid I not say The prudence of my younger son would justify The charge I trusted to himâO! I knew He would not rashly give the rein to vengeance:â You seem to heed me not!âWhat means this silence! Where are my sons?âDo they approach? CLIFFORD. They do. KING HENRY. Quick let me meet them, fly to their embrace; And in the strength of my united house, Laugh at the haughty menace of the Legate. CLIFFORD. O! stay my royal lordâfor if you go, You go to ruin and captivity. KING HENRY. Your words amaze me! Solve these contradictions. Did you not say my sons were reconcil'd? That Johnâ CLIFFORD. Is a perfidious traitor! KING HENRY. Rash young man, Do not provoke my rage. I know his faith, Approv'd, unshaken; nor will hear a doubt, That envious hate, or jealousy may breathe Against his firm attachment to his father. CLIFFORD. Envious of him? Jealous of his attachment To you, my lord?âI were, indeed, the worst, The most abandon'd traitor, if I could But even in thought, betray the trust you gave, As he has done. KING HENRY. Away! no more of this CLIFFORD. O! sir, if my destruction were alone The fatal consequence of your persisting Still in this pleasing error, I would never Offend you with the truth, but calmly yield To that worst ill, your undeserv'd displeasure; Lie under the suspicion of employing The envious arts of secret defamation, To injure him you love. But, sir, your safety, Your liberty demand that I should speak The atrocious deed. Fly from these walls this instant; You have not here a moment's safety! Know The princes, with united powers approach, First to depose, and then imprison you. KING HENRY. Ha!âboth the princes said you?â CLIFFORD. Yes, sir, both.â As with arm'd heels I urg'd my fiery courser In the pursuit of John, I met his force Returning with the rebel troops of Richard, In friendly folds their mingled banners waving, But hostile each to you.âI then deliver'd The terms of general peace and pardon to them; Terms, which imperious Richard only answer'd By scorn and indignation, which were blown To tenfold violence by the suggestions, And dark insidious hints. KING HENRY. O, my swoll'n heart!â Speak not his hated name, lest like the dagger Of foul unnatural parricide, it pierce My bleeding bosom.âHave I thus, beneath The semblance of the purest filial love, Foster'd ingratitude!âMy fondest hope, The only stay of my declining years, Is vanish'd into air.âI feel it hereâ With deadly force it rends my breaking heart.â I sink beneath the blow! [Falls into the arms of his Attendants. CLIFFORD. Sir, look upâ Be comforted;âresume your resolution! KING HENRY. Never!âthis fatal stroke has kill'd my hopes.â I have no joy, no consolation, left me.â My Clifford, I have wrong'd thy faithful service By causeless doubt! CLIFFORD. Waste not a thought on me.â [Trumpet at a distance. Heard you that warlike sound?âSir, they approachâ O! for your own, and for your people's sake, Consult your safety.âUrge with speed your flightâ The danger presses.âI will face the storm With the few faithful troops I can assemble, While you escape.âRuin surrounds you hereâ But could you reach the shores of Englandâ KING HENRY. No! Death is my choice, and I can perish here. I feel the languor of declining life O'erwhelm my fainting frame.âMy woes, alas! Will be of short duration.âHappy island! Seat of my former glory, ne'er again Shall thy white cliffs rise to my longing eyes In pleasing prospectânever more these lungs Inhale the balmy fragrance of thy air.â France must receive my ashesâyet, my Clifford, Let not my destiny involve theeâfly! Preserve thyself, and leave me to my fate. CLIFFORD. Now you indeed are cruelâyour suspicions Do hurt me now.âLeave you? and can you deem So basely of me?âNo, sir, I will stay And sacrifice my latest breath to serve you. KING HENRY. O! my dear son, thy filial virtue comes Like the faint radiance of the setting ray That gilds the evening storm, to cheer the close Of my tempestuous days. They soothe my anguish, And almost teach me not to hate mankindâ My only thought towards life is, how to recompense Such exemplary goodness;âbut I feel It cannot beâI die!âand leave my power To those who have destroy'd meâin whose eyes Fidelity to me will be a crime.â Oh! I am sick to death;âleadâlead me in. [Exit, led by Clifford. Scene before the Abbey. Enter Prince Richard, and Prince John, with English and Norman Soldiers. PRINCE RICHARD. My brave companions, prosperous fortune smiles Upon our waving ensigns; all who meet us, Meet us as friends, and swell our growing ranks With their encreasing numbers!âBut these walls, These fatal walls, strike terror thro' my soul!â My breast is chill'd with fearâperhaps my Adelaide Is now devoted to my father's arms!â Summon the inmates of this dreary mansion! ABBESS , at the grate. What voice profane, so loudly dares disturb The peaceful sabbath of this holy dome? PRINCE RICHARD. Richard of England; who comes here the champio Of innocence, and beauty.âWhen the walls Devoted to religion yield a refuge To persecuted virtue, they are sacred From worldly interruption; every spear Should bow it's steely point in holy reverenceâ But when they once become the guilty seat Of violence and outrage, every claim Of sanctity is lost; each gloomy cloister Is by the hand severe of equal justice, Mark'd for destruction.âTherefore, on the instant Bring forth my Adelaide, or by my honor, A soldier's injur'd honor, I will raze This fabric to the earth. Enter Adelaide from the Abbey. ADELAIDE. Forber, rash man, Your guilty violenceânor after breaking The sacred laws of duty, and of honor, Revolting from your king, your sire, your country, Wage impious war with heaven. PRINCE RICHARD. My Adelaide, Are your vows pass'd?âThen I am truly wretched. ADELAIDE. 'Tis so indeed, my lord. But yet remember Whose groundless jealousy, whose words injurious, Whose harsh reproofs, disclaiming even the shadow Of tenderness and love, have driven me hither. I had no other proof, alas! to give, That my rejected heart was true to you, Tho' it refus'd to share your crimesâThat virtue, And not a pageant sceptre, was the idol That I preferr'd even to your love. PRINCE RICHARD. O cruel And fatal proof, that has for ever doom'd me To misery and woe!âTo see you torn For ever from me thusâto find you innocent, Yet know you never can be mine.âDistraction! ADELAIDE. [Going. Farewell. PRINCE RICHARD. Ah! do not leave me, Adelaideâ Give me one tender word, one parting look. ADELAIDE. YesâI will speak once moreânay, will confess, That spite of all the holy vows I breath'd, Nor time, nor prayer, nor penitence, I fear, Will ever blot you from my wounded bosom, Till in the dark oblivion of the grave Your image and my life are sunk together. I feel I've said too muchâMy lord, farewell! Where e'er you go, may prosperous fortune wait you, And angels shield you in the hour of danger With love as zealous, and as pure as mine: And when some fairer and some happier virgin (You cannot meet a truer) shall receive With more auspicious stars your nuptial vows, If e'er the fervid temper of your mind Lead you to doubt her faith, O let one thought Of your unhappy Adelaide come o'er Your ruffled soul, and tell you, innocence May be unjusty slandered.âTake my sad, My last adieuâfor we must meet no more. [Exit. PRINCE RICHARD. Stay, stay, my only hope!âLeave me not thus A prey to deep remorse and woeâShe is goneâ For ever goneâand am I left alone, Amid a world that gives no joy without her.â Curse on my blind credulity, that mov'd me To wound her tried fidelity. PRINCE JOHN. Why blame With such asperity the glaring proofs On which your scorn was founded? Be not ever Dup'd by the false pretence of female artifice. PRINCE RICHARD. Enough of thisâI have, alas! too much Listened to your suggestions.âThat dark mind, Is much too prone, I fear, to judge of others By what it reads withinâYour dangerous counsels Have ruin'd me.âThe only consolation That now remains is vengeanceâYes, those walls Shall feel my furyâand, unnatural father, [Pointing to the town. You shall partake my ruinâCalls of duty, And impulse of affection, I disclaim youâ Ye shall not check my rageâAssist me soldiers. Enter Clifford from the Abbey. CLIFFORD. Stay thy ungovern'd violence, rash man, Nor further tempt thy fate. PRINCE RICHARD. Clifford!âAway! Stop not the torrent of my just revenge, Lest it o'erwhelm thee. CLIFFORD. And is Clifford then So little known to Richard, that he thinks His threatenings will appal him? Are the towers of Mans forgot, where this true breast, undaunted, Oppos'd itself a bulwark to your numbers, In our dear father's cause, while your fell sword Hunted his sacred life. Alas! this hour Demands not manly courageâ'tis not now That spears and swords must triumphâHere's a sight To freeze your impious ardor, rivet down With gorgon look your stiffen'd limbs to earth. [King Henry's body brought in. Unnatural offspring of a murder'd king, Slain by your harsh unkindness!âParricides! Look on that corse, and if the seeds of nature Yet live within your breastsâweep tears of blood. PRINCE RICHARD. [Dropping his sword. O sight of woeâMy father! O my father! PRINCE JOHN. Ah, lamentable day!â CLIFFORD. And dost thou weep, Perfidious hypocrite, whose cruel treachery First broke his noble heartâThat was the shaft That brought him to the dust. With manly firmness He bore his son's revolt, his faithless troops; Yes, blush ye shame to English loyalty; [To the English soldiers. The Legate's insolence, who refus'd to break The vows of Adelaide; for know, and mourn Thy hasteâmisguided prince, he was employing Each means to heal thy sufferings, while the breath Of that malignant traitor, which first rais'd Your mutual jealousy, was then corrupting Thy faith by new suspicions. PRINCE JOHN. 'Tis as false As hell and thee.â CLIFFORD. Did not yon awful ruin Of murder'd majesty, o'ercharge with sorrow My better spirits, this vindictive arm Should force thy recreant accents to confess The truth of what I sayâthat now is pastâ This hand shall never grasp a sword again. For when I have perform'd the solemn rites To martyr'd Henry's shade, I vow to give The remnant of my life to holy duties. Whene'er you call upon me, I will prove To you, and all mankind, this dreadful charge, Not by the doubtful arm of violence, But by true facts, and clear unbiass'd witness. PRINCE RICHARD. If he does prove this chargeâand much I fear It will be soâI shall for ever hold thee An alien to my bloodâunfit to taint The light of day, and social haunts of manâ 'Till then we hold thee prisonerâInjur'd corse, I tremble to approach thee, lest thy blood Bursting it's swelling channels, rush upon me, And mark me as thy murderer.âClifford, see The obsequies with reverend care perform'd;â For I will fly these climes, and you, my friends, Companions of my guiltâbut by that guilt, Alas! seduc'dâtogether let us go, And, on the stern oppressors of our faith, Expiate our crimes.âAnd thou, much injur'd saint, In these lone walls secluded, in thy orisons, When thou pour'st forth thy fervent soul in pray'r, O breathe one sigh for a repentant wretch, Whom the wild frenzy of ungovern'd passion Has torn from thee, and happiness, for ever.
