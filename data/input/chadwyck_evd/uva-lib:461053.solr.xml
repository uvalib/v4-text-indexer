      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Bed-Chamber of Damon and Galatea. Galatea. Thrice has the cock cried, “Waken, maid and wife!” Yon barndoor sings as merry as a fife. Heaven bless the day, and safe from rain-drops keep My Sunday silk. What, Damon, do you sleep? Up, sluggard! and, good Calend-keeper, say How name you this fair morn? Damon, sleepily. Eight short o'May. Galatea. Praise Heaven, that kept your Galatea free From wits like yours. 'Tis April twenty-three; So far yu're Solomon; but this sweet morn Three hundred years our Corydon was born. Damon. A murrain on your Corydon! Galatea. What's that? Damon. The landlord of the Bagpipes and the Cat, Vile master of a viler public, where As I was sitting last September fair, Deep in my cups, not knowing white from brown, He changed me a new penny for a crown. Galatea. Pig! idiot! husband! keep your common pelf, Cat, Corydon, and Bagpipes to yourself. I with good disposition will provide For all the offerings of this holy tide. Ho! Phyllis, Amaryllis! four o'clock! Shame, lazy girls, to let a common cock Crow o'er your slumbers. Phyllis and Amaryllis, dressing outside. Nay! our brooms were going Two hours before he even dreamed of crowing. Galatea. Come in, my merry handmaidens, and ask What wool is needful for your morning's task. Phyllis. Good lack! dear Amaryllis, go you first: I'm all unlaced. Amaryllis. Phyllis, my stays have burst. Phyllis. My hair's about my heels. Amaryllis. Your hair, you said? Ha! here's my nightcap dangling on my head. Phyllis. Well, let's go in together, we'll profess Such early risers have no light to dress. [Enter Phyllis and Amaryllis. Galatea. Good morrow, girls! You've heard the village say Our poet Corydon was born to-day. And since I told my left hand from my right, I can remember 'twas a time of white. My grandsire's wont it was at morning dew The tomb with seasonable gifts to strew, And finest flour he took, from the wild bees He borrowed honey, and the primroses Wove all their slender arms to intertwine A garland drenched with stoups of elder wine. Should Galatea doubt to do the same, My grandsire's villagers should cry me shame. Go then, my Amaryllis, while the flowers Are wet with dew, “improve the shining hours,” And from the basket of my wools make bright A various task of crimson and of white. [Exit Amaryllis. Galatea rises, and sits down before the glass. Phyllis, unlock my chest, therein reposes My silk, dark blue, with intervals of roses. I mean the dress I wore last Lammas fair, Far bluer than Myrtilla's;—for my hair Set it with cowslips; though the Fates cried nay, We'd have a merry festival to-day. Phyllis, arranging Galatea's hair. As Melibœus, Thyrsis, you outshone Myrtilla, mistress; but who's Corydon? Galatea. Since Corydon has died, the master's flute Hangs on the peg melodiously mute. No ear has caught his music, and no hand Can press the stops, for none can understand. So sweet a singer ne'er shall sing to men Till Corydon himself come back again. Phyllis. O! so he played the flute. And did he keep The while he played a flock of woolly sheep? For Melibœus minds a herd, and he Can play the flute, and once he played to me. Galatea. My Phyllis, bid this Melibœus mind His woolly sheep, and leave his flute behind. But see our Amaryllis comes. [Re-enter Amaryllis. Amaryllis. The dew Is on the upland, and the day's all blue. Just over the brown fallow, loud and blithe The lark is hanging, Thyrsis whets his scythe Close where the river-line through grasses green Runs cool and white along the soft ravine. I, as by Thyrsis' side I stooped to get Anemone or couching violet, Saw down the glistening grass and through the trees The village hiving like a swarm of bees. Then, as this motley band with frequent stirs Clustered and swayed, “What mean these villagers, Thyrsis?” said I; but, while his scythe swept on, Said surly Thyrsis, “'Tis for Corydon.” Back with my flowers I came, my mind all dim What Corydon's to me or I to him,— Back with my flowers, but ever as I came Long lines of scarlet mantles like a flame Shot through the trees, white smock, and purple blouse, Quick winding down the green birch avenues. When I the wicket reached they were so far As a thin voice could sound,—and here they are. Galatea. How the girl prates! To hear her one would say Her parents were a rattle and a jay. [Exeunt Galatea, Phyllis, and Amaryllis. SCENE II. The front of Galatea's Farm. Enter Galatea, Phyllis, Amaryllis, Melibœus, Menalcas, Alphesibœus, and Peasants. Melibœus. O Galatea! whom three flocks obey, Queen of our butter-milk, and curds and whey, Receive the pastoral gifts I bring to-day. This yellow swan-marked butter, that you see, Was churned from my fawn-coloured Alderney. And here are cheeses three, soft, round, and white, Pressed by my three deft maidens in a night. No defter maidens in our village dwell, Nor Phyllis' self can press a cheese so well. Last take this bowl of cream all yellowy, which On the low marshlands of my farm grew rich, Thick round the ladle curled, in foam-bells blown By early winds,—and all for Corydon. Menalcas. O Galatea! on whose walls I know The softest peaches and big nectarines grow, Take these more humble fruits my hands bestow. Apples of various kinds, these—I forget Their name, and these the Kentish Fillbasket; Their cheeks all red and glowing you may see As when they fell last autumn from the tree. A bantam's eggs, soft-curved, in hay-wisps pressed, White as new milk, just taken from the nest. Cider and mead I bring, and a vast scone Of honeyed barley, all for Corydon. Alphesibœus. Sweet mistress Galatea! though I knew No mortal feeds such lusty hens as you, Yet as I could I brought my offerings too. This is the hen Myrtilla used to beg, And this the goose that lays the golden egg. And,—as this morning through the woods we wound, I heard the coo of doves, and climbing found A pair of turtles, which shall make their moan, If Galatea please, for Corydon. Galatea. Thanks, gentle friends; no mean bequests you bring, A whole heart consecrates a lowly thing. But see, we lag behind the eager day: The greenwood calls us hence, Come, come away! Join hand in hand, sweet friends, the dews are drying, The birds are singing, and the bells replying, Come to the woods, and hear the turtles moan, For so we surely please, for Corydon. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Corydon's Tomb. A Wood. Enter Galatea, Phyllis, Amaryllis, Melibœus, Thyrsis, Menalcas, Alphesibœus, and Peasants. Galatea. Good master Melibœus! send you grace To stay your willing gaiters; here's the place. Phyllis. How soft and delicately moves the air! Amaryllis. Did ever birds of heaven sing half so fair? Menalcas. And see the lichens grey have overgrown The carven lines, “Hic jacet Corydon.” Whereby I hold our Corydon 'tis clear Here has been lying nigh three hundred year. Alphesibœus. I've heard my grandsire say, his grandsire said, That he had heard, when Corydon was dead He lay abed from twilight until day, But when they came at dawn he was away. And some old lieawakes made oath they wist By nightfall of a wondrous floating mist, Pale lilac in the shadows of the moon. Which travelled woodwards like a silent tune. Light hammers, too, they heard, with fairy stroke, As woodpeckers soft tapping upon oak. When doubting this strange tale men sought the wood, There, like a dream, the poet's tombstone stood. But who it was the body did convey In such strange sort, or built the tomb this way, My grandsire's grandsire could not surely say. Galatea. Here by our poet's tomb let all agree, In faithful vows of love and amity. Let each in presence of this common friend Forget himself, and all his quarrels end. Melibœus. to Phyllis. Good were it for the flock, were Love not strayed; Well spoke the mistress, but what says the maid? Phyllis. Love never strayed until Neæra bold Stole shepherd Melibœus from his fold. Melibœus. Nay, Melibœus marvelled why his herd Menalcas' care before his own preferred. Phyllis. Come, tell me truly, at last Shrove-tide fair You set no primrose in Neæra's hair? Melibœus. Ah! Phyllis, Phyllis! was there none to see Menalcas' kiss beneath the linden tree? Galatea. What! out of tune already! Girl, what's this We all have heard? A quarrel and a kiss! But ha! [Enter a pair of marvellous fantastical linnets. Sweet things, you sing like tinkling dew On thirsty grass. But, prythee, who are you? The Linnets. Titiotix! When Corydon was here, Of all the songs he loved we were most dear. Titiotix! When Corydon was dead, His loving spirit made us birds instead. When twilight comes, and the grey smoke is curled More soft, we flutter round the quiet world, Haunting the wood, or slope, or woolly pen, But chiefly the still hearts of dreaming men. From Corydon we come; he much approves Your loyal affections, and for these kind loves He fain would heard your kindred souls confess Your village joys and woes and wickedness. You, Galatea, without stint or grudge, Shall of the praise or sentence be the judge. Titiotio—come, we wait, begin, Most merry Melibœus, with your sin. Melibœus. Alas! for how two linnets should compel My tongue to truth is more than I can tell. Yet listen. Phyllis came to me alone And asked a song; I sang her for my own An air that I had found in Corydon. Galatea. And was there any prize to gain or miss? Melibœus. Aye, madam Galatea,—'twas a kiss. All. Ha! ha! how merry! Phyllis. You shall smart for this! Galatea. Indeed, fair sir, I hope you won your suit.— But for our sentence, you must break your flute, Lest, while amid the meadows pondering deep On hidden strains, you lose an obvious sheep. Now, Phyllis! Amaryllis! come, girls, say What mischief you have dreamed since yesterday. Methinks mere girls were better shut within Glass cases, quite beyond the breath of sin, As wax dolls innocent, all crisped and curled, Crystal perfections. Phyllis. Well, we're like the world. For, as the hundred-headed parson ran Last Sunday doubling through his mazy plan, I fell asleep, and dreamed, in Stratford town That I beheld a wondrous mottled gown, A wondrous mottled gown, but passing dear, Scarce as I watched the price I checked the tear. But “ah,” said I, “Menalcas will approve This wondrous gown: Menalcas is my love, And for a kiss this gown he sure will buy.” The Linnets. Titiotio!—Phyllis you're a lie! Amaryllis. I too in church was dreaming, and I saw A bonnet all in plaits of dainty straw, With ribbons half-a-yard of blushing peach; How I desired those ribbons passes speech; For once I heard Alphesibœus tell Menalcas, “Peach suits Amaryllis well.” The Linnets. Titiotiotix!—False maids, you both Have been on trial, and each breaks her oath. Phyllis, weeping. Oh! oh! sweet linnets, pardon! yes 'tis true, And, Melibœus, I've no love but you; In vain Menalcas shall one kiss implore, If you will take me to your arms once more. Amaryllis, in tears. Ah! Thyrsis dear, though surly you may be, If but again your lips and mine agree, Alphesibœus may go hang for me. Galatea. Well, well! enough;—your quarrel's at an end: Where nothing's broken 'tis not hard to mend. Here, Melibœus, though your lips are mute, You now may win your prize without the flute. Here, Thyrsis, leave your scythe, nor doubtful stand, And, Amaryllis, let me have your hand; And since by him your mutual bliss is won, O happy pair, forget not Corydon! All O happy pair, forget not Corydon! Galatea, bringing forward the offerings. Lift high the silver urn, and therein fill Honey, and wine, and water from the rill. And cowslips fetch, and bluebells, and Lent lilies, For Corydon most loves the daffodillies. O Corydon! though at your tomb we lift No artful song, nor any costly gift, Yet all our hearts are yours, for ever move Master and friend, and poet of our love. The shepherd dies,—your music lives the same, And cradled babies lisp our poet's name; Our shepherd youth the summer twilight long Ring the grey dells with echoes of his song, And old men say his homely human phrase Lights a warm sun on their declining days. Then, poet, turn your kind approving eyes Upon your kinsmen, nor indeed despise Love's meaner symbols and poor sacrifice. The Linnets. Mistress, you sing right well, and rest you sure Our Corydon despises nothing pure. Melibœus to Phyllis. Our Corydon has said, “There are no slips Between a shepherd and his sweetheart's lips.” [Kisses her. Phyllis. Once the reeds swore,—so Corydon declares,— “My Melibœus has grown asses' ears.” [Boxes his ears, and runs off. Melibœus. Phyllis, I think one kiss will scarce repay Full twenty wrongs in a short April day. [Runs after her. All. Come, kinsmen, come! enough we all have played: The noon is high, let's to the beechen shade. Sooth to our children's children we'll recall How on this day we kept high festival, How the birds twittered, and the sunlight shone, In the three-hundredth year of Corydon. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Corydon's Tomb. A Wood. Enter Bavius, Mævius, Fannius, Furius, and the Corydon Committee. Bavius. “Who hates not Bavius, loves a special train,” So sang the Muse and lofty was the strain. Yet, as we came, methought Apollo swore, “A special train shall Bavius seek no more.” Mævius. Where were ye Nine, for whom my tuneful strings Rise smooth and lightly as a goose's wings, Where were ye Nine, when your melodious swain Sank in the mud-sloughs of a Stratford lane? The Committee. Where's the sad shepherd loves a doleful ditty, Let him bespeak the Corydon Committee. We ne'er by Helicon were caught asleep, Nor with the Muses any reckoning keep. Yet o'er one Corydon we've had more strife In half-a-year, than others in a life. For six long months whoe'er desired to sail Proud in stray feathers from this peacock's tail, Came from his shop, and, careless of his pelf, Cried, “Great is Corydon,” which means himself. We've heard what Bavius knew, what Mævius thought, Divided, subdivided, squabbled, fought; To-day we swear, and all the world shall know it, “This Corydon of Stratford was a poet.” Fannius. Well, where's the tomb? for Murray says you pass By six tall hay-stacks and a tethered ass, Follow an endless lane, turn up and down, Fetch a good compass about Stratford town, So back into the road, and thence not far You'll find a beechen wood, and there you are. Yet there's no tomb. Furius. Well, Fannius, where's the hurry? This is a charming prospect— Fannius. So says Murray. Well, on the moss that binds this crumbling pile Let our Committee sit and rest awhile. [Fannius and the Committee sit down on the tomb. But Phœbus!— [Enter Tityrus. Master Beadle, can you say If Corydon has built his tomb this way? Tityrus. The butcher's knave, that travelled far and wide For his lost cleaver, found it by his side. Mævius. Muse! let the rose with young potatoes bloom, If riddles grow in Stratford. Tityrus. Here's the tomb. Mævius. What, this the tomb! this palace of young efts, Storehouse of rubbish, full of chinks and clefts! Say, do you think, most venerable crow, I was born yesterday? Tityrus, regarding him. I should say “No!” Mævius. Well, then, if here's the tomb, the tomb shall give To Mævius his land's prerogative. Who shall deny, if tuneful Mævius claim O'er buried Corydon to carve his name? [Cuts his name on the tomb. Tityrus. Sirs, when the Mayor and Corporation sat, They gave to Tityrus a beadle's hat; A hat they gave, but lest the boys should laugh, They added to the gift a beadle's staff. [Tityrus beats Mævius. Furius. Peace, peace, good Tityrus! you have nought to fear, We've come to honour Corydon. [Enter stray Committee Man, and exit Tityrus. Who's here? Committee Man. Pork pies, and pasties, chickens, and champagne, Cake, sweetmeats, all are stolen from the train. One salad's left, 'tis true, of broken glass Well mashed with knives and forks. The Committee, beating their breasts. Alas! Alas! Bavius. I thank thee, Phœbus! who dost still pursue Thy poet's noontide with celestial dew. Whom the Parnassian Muses feed on verse, No butcher's bill shall vex his sacred purse. The Committee. Ah, happy Bavius, a Parnassian curry! Fannius. Well, well! we've done the tomb, and, “now” says Murray, “From this sweet spot the visitor may see The poet's cottage and his mulberry tree.” Set up the telescope, my Furius, high on His stand, the poet's cottage is a lion. [Furius and Fannius arrange the telescope, and enter “Our Own Correspondent.” Bavius to O. O. C. Sir, stand to Phœbus, Phœbus asks your name. O. O. C. Then Phœbus may go hang,—the “Acta” claim Me, “Our Own Correspondent,” and, in short, Have sent me here to Stratford to report. [Begins to take notes. Bavius. O nameless beetle! O mysterious man! Mævius. My Bavius, be as civil as you can, Lest you should find to-morrow's “Acta” tell Our correspondent can call names as well. Furius to Fannius. More to the left? Fannius. Right, Murray says. There stop Between the steeple and the butcher's shop. It is the hour.—Pale Faith, and bright-eyed Hope, Advance, twin muses of the telescope! Furius has fixed the focus firm and true, The poet's residence is now on view. [Looks through the glass. Is it a dream? For ineffectual Death Bows his pale head, the Ages hold their breath; Serenely victor over crouching Time The poet rises, pastoral, sublime. Stay, poet, stay! this pale blue light diffuse, I see— [Fannius runs away from the telescope. The Committee. Ha! What? Fannius, faintly. Two butchers in the blues. O. O. C., laughing. Ha! ha! By going right you have indeed gone wrong. But turn the focus to the left, ere long A pale blue Corydon shall rise again, Mending his nibs before the window-pane. Fannius. A plague on you and Murray! 'Twas the sun. Bavius. What, Phœbus? Phœbus half his course has run Through the tired heavens, and yet the task's undone. Say, Phœbus, say on whom the Muse bestowed The ode to Corydon. The Committee. The ode! the ode! Bavius. By early dawn I heard Apollo swear, “None but my Bavius fill the Laureate's chair.” Mævius. This ode was in my dreams addressed to me, In the hand-writing of Calliope. [Shows an envelope. Furius. The hand is mine. Fannius. Can any bard supply More stanzas than can Fannius? [Enter Martinus Tuppperus. Martinus Tupperus. That can I. For once, Committee, in an idle freak I wrote three hundred sonnets in a week. The Committee. All hail, Martinus! though indeed your name Is not on the Committee. Martinus Tupperus. More's the shame. Bavius, I swear the muse has not bestowed Upon your brain the laurel and the ode. The Committee. A match! a match! Quick, give the poets place! Advance, good shepherds. Phœbus send you grace, Your own Committee shall award the crown. Come, tuneful swains! but first your stakes set down. Bavius. An unjust stepmother at home have I. The Committee. Come, none of that! some stake you can't deny. Bavius. This flask of mountain dew Apollo gave, And owned me victor in the tuneful stave. If this celestial prize Martinus gain, And Bavius yield, 'twill give Apollo pain. Martinus Tupperus. These “Proverbs” see, just taken from the shelf, Decked with a bust to represent myself. When you behold the book, you'll all agree The flask's outstaked by my “Philosophy.” The Committee. Nay, rather, since we've lost our meal, the winner Supply the ode, his rival stand the dinner. Bavius. Bon Gaultier, Blackwood, Horace, and a score Approve my fame, and swell the Muses' store; And Phœbus with Melpomene agrees, My anapæsts can hop like nimble fleas. Martinus Tupperus. Muse have I none—Apollo I refuse, A heathen he,—the Public is my muse. And Hatchard, Piccadilly, best can tell This coy Camena loves Martinus well. The Committee. Enough of testimonials,—now rehearse, Melodious shepherds, from your pastoral verse. Martinus Tupperus. No metres vex my verse. I wander free, Of my proverbial line sole patentee. [Sings. Greater is Mangnall than Corydon, for he talketh of Railways and Substance. Greater than Mangnall, Martinus, for he blendeth Instruction with Proverbs. Better like accumulated limpets to stick upon the rock of Fact, Than in a three-volumed novel to drift upon a flowery Ocean, And to perish in the iron arms of the Sphynx and Charybdis of Fiction. Books are portmanteaus of Wisdom, when they are packed with Information. But, my son, enter not the doors of the unprofitable play-house, Even though Fashion entice thee, saying, “Corydon is piping on the stage.” Though thy weakness yearn unto Corydon, Political Economy says, “No, Greater is Mangnall than Corydon, and greater Martinus than Mangnall: Whoso thirsteth after Wisdom let him drink of the pages of Martinus.” The Committee. Happy the man that loves Martinus' feasts! Now, Bavius, let us hear your anapæsts. Bavius. 'Twas but this morning as I lay a-bed That Phœbus sang me, “Corydon is dead.” [Sings. Wake! for the lark the clear heavens is adorning, Wake Phyllis, and Damon, and Susan, and Ned, Trip, trip 'neath the stars through the mists of the morning, Away to the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. Wake! for the Muse is in mourning, and Phœbus Is twittering a dirge to the birds overhead, Calliope tells us she ne'er heard the bee buzz So sad in the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. Prototyped duly in Worcestershire china, Wooing your shepherdess daintily bred, Colin, sweet shepherd, bring Susan or Lina, Or both, to the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. For Lina is stitching by the cows in the kitchen, And barefooted Susan she bakes in the shed, Come Lina, come Susan, be quick, slip your shoes on, And come to the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. What shepherd his nights in the Unicorn passes, Let him take to the Temperance tea-cups instead, Leave the jingle of glasses and nimble-heeled lasses, And come to the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. Leave the cow to the tillage, leave the dog to the village, Come Phyllis, and Damon, and Susan, and Ned, Come master and varlet, in green or in scarlet, Away to the greenwood, for Corydon's dead. The Committee. O dirge divine! How sweet the music rings! What anapæstic bard like Bavius sings? Enter Galatea, Melibœus, Thyrsis, Menalcas, Alphesibœus, Peasants and Linnets. Galatea. Pray, strangers, who are you that thus intrude Your noisy brawling on this sacred wood? The Linnets. “Who are you?” quotha; why, stark madmen clear. Titiotiotix—what want you here? The Committee. Arcadian friends, from London town we came, The Corydon Committee is our name. For once, most rustic band, there lived a man,— [The Linnets peck the Committee. (Confound these fowls,—good madam, if you can, Call off your thrushes)—who without dispute Lived in this country-side, and played the flute. This poet's name was Corydon, and we Are come to keep his tercentenary. Which means, Arcadian sirs, that since his birth Three hundred years have travelled o'er the earth. This is the gentleman who sang so sweet— [Pointing to Bavius: the Linnets peck Bavius. Bavius. Good Phœbus! slay these hornets, I entreat. The Committee. Who sang so sweet, and when the sun goes down, A lecture he intends in Stratford town. Galatea, half aside. How came these tailors here? The Committee. By special train. The Linnets. Titiotix—Then so go back again. What do you doubt?—come, friends, and test your sticks On the Committee—Tiotiotix. [Melibœus and Peasants beat the Committee. Furius. Alas! Alas! Bavius. Good Phœbus, let me hide Somewhere in Helicon. Mævius. My head! my side! Fannius. Save me, Committee, Fannius save! Alas! Too late I learn that Murray is an ass. The Committee. But oh! the pity, Fannius, the pity We e'er became the Corydon Committee. Martinus Tupperus. Avaunt, proud rustic band! The author I Of the “Proverbial Philosophy.” Melibœus. Then the more reason why you should be beat, For each edition we'll the stroke repeat. [Pursues Martinus. Galatea. Sensation, take your truants back to school, And fix their bounds within your city rule. There let them watch some trembling half-starved thing Mount o'er the poplars on a rotten string; There let them, tricked in all your arts, engage The pen, the brush, and the degenerate stage, And find such masters, as your pupils should, Ready to hand,—a Braddon and a Wood. But, for such blades scarce suit our country fairs, Pray keep your children to Belgravia's squares. Let dainty Pyrrha, whilst her eyes grow dim, And the low candle splutters on the rim, Last sentinel of night, in deepening gloom, Husband her wick, to see who murdered whom. Let her the Queens of Bigamy adore, The Lady Audley, and the “Miss Aurore,” And triumph with victorious Eleanore. Forbid your noisy pupils to invade Our simple dell, and unpropitious shade. Scarce will they find in this dull round of life A murderer, or two husbands to one wife. Then in your stirring scenes live on, nor crave To play such mummeries o'er a poet's grave. The Linnets. Hurrah! the lusty cudgel moves amain. For Bavius one, Martinus smite again. The time runs short, the train's at half-past six, Follow through brake and briar, most noble sticks, Titiotiotiotiotix. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
