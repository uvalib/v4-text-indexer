      <field name="fulltext">To the Queenes most excellent Maiestie. That which their zeale, whose onely zeale was bent To shew the best they could that might delight Your royall minde, did lately represent Renown'd Empresse to your Princely sight: Is now the offring of their humblenesse, Here consecrated to your glorious name; Whose happy presence did vouchsafe to blesse So poore presentments, and to grace the same: And though it be in th'humblest ranke of words, And in the lowest region of our speach, Yet is it in that kinde, as best accords With rurall passions, which vse not to reach Beyond the groues, and woods where they were bred: And best become a claustrall exercise, Where men shut out retyr'd, and sequestred From publike fashion, seeme to sympathize With innocent, and plaine simplicity: And liuing here vnder the awfull hand Of discipline, and strict obseruancy, Learne but our weakenesses to vnderstand, And therefore dare not enterprize to show In lowder stile the hidden mysteries, And arts of Thrones, which none that are below Tho Sphere of action, and the exercise Of power can truely stew: though men may straine Conceipt aboue the pitch where it should stand, And forme more monstrous figures then containe A possibility, and goe beyond. The nature of those managements so farre, As oft their common decency they marre: Whereby the populasse (in whom such skill Is needlesse) may be brought to apprehend Notions, that may turne all to a tast of ill What euer power shall do, or might intend: And thinke all cunning, all proceeding one, And nothing simple, and sincerely done: Yet the eye of practise, looking downe from hie Vpon such ouer-reaching vanity, Sees how from error t'error it doth flote, As from an vnknowne Ocean into a Gulfe: And how though th'Woolfe, would counterfeit the Goate, Yet euery chinke bewrayes him for a Woolfe. And therefore in the view of state t'haue show'd A counterfeit of state had beene to light A candle to the Sunne, and so bestow'd Our paines to bring our dimnesse vnto light. For maiesty, and power, can nothing see Without it selfe, that can sight-worthy be. And therefore durst not we but on the ground, From whence our humble Argument hath birth, Erect our Scene, and thereon are we found, And if we fall, we fall but on the earth, From whence we pluckt the flowers that here we bring; Which if at their first opening they did please, It was enough, they serue but for a spring, The first sent is the best in things as these: A musicke of this nature on the ground, Is euer wont to vanish with the sound. But yet your royall goodnesse may raise new, Grace but the Muses they will honour you. Chi non fa, non falla.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS. I. SCENA. I. Ergastus. MelilÃ¦us. How is it MelibÃ¦us that we finde Our Country, faire Arcadia, so much chang'd From what it was, that was thou knowest of late, The gentle region of plaine honesty, The modest seat of vndisguised truth, Inhabited with simple innocence And now, I know not how, as if it were, Vnhallowed, and diuested of that grace, Hath put off that faire nature which it had, And growes like ruder countries, or more bad. Mel. Indeed Ergastus I haue neuer knowne, So vniuersall a distemperature, In all parts of the body of our state, As now there is; nor euer haue we heard So much complaining of disloyalty, Among'st your yonger Nymphes, nor euer found Our heardsmen so deluded in their loues, As if there were no faith on either side. We neuer had in any age before So many spotlesse Nymphes, so much distain'd VVith blacke report, and wrongfull infamy, That few escape the tongue of malice free. Erg. And me thinkes too, our very aire is chang'd, Our wholesome climate growne more maladies The fogges, and the Syrene offends vs more (Or we may thinke so, then they did before) The windes of Autumne, now are sayd to bring More noysomnesse, then those do of the Spring: And all of vs feele new infirmities, New Feuers, new Catarres, oppresse our powers, The milke wherewith we cur'd all maladies, Hath either lost the nature, or we ours. Mel. And we that neuer were accustomed To quarrell for our bounds, how do we see Montanus and Acrysius interstriue How farre their seuerall Sheep-walkes should extend, And cannot be agreed to what we can: As if some vnderworking hand strake fire, To th'apt inkindling tinder of debate, And fostred their contention and their hate. Erg. And me thinkes too, the beauty of our Nymphes Is not the same as it was wont to be. That Rosie hew, the glory of the Cheeke, Is either stolne, or else they haue forgot, To blush with shame, or to be pale with feare: Or else their shame doth make them alwayes blush For alwayes doth their beauties beare one hew, And eitheir Nature's false, or that vntrue. Mel. Besides their various habits grow so strange, As that although their faces certaine are, Their bodies are vncertaine euery day, And alwayes differing from themselues so farre, As if they skorn'd to be the same they are. And all of vs are so transform'd, that we Discerne not an Arcadian by th'attyre, Our ancient Pastorall habits are despis'd, And all is strange, hearts, clothes, and all disguis'd, Erg. Indeed vnto our griefe we may perceiue, The whole complection of Arcadia chang'd, Yet cannot finde the occasion of this change: But let vs with more wary eye obserue Whence the contagion of these customes rise, That haue infected thus our honest plaines, With cunning discord, idle vanity, Deceiptfull wrong, and causlesse infamy, That by th'assistance of our grauer Swaines, We now at first, may labour to preuent The further course of mischiefes, and restore Our late cleane woods, to what they were before. Mel. Content Ergastus, and euen here will be A place conuenient for so fit a worke: For here our Nymphs, and heardsmen on this greene, Do vsually resort, and in this Groue We may obserue them best, and be vnseene. SCEN. II. Colax. Techne. Come my deare Techne, thou and I must plot More cunning proiects yet, more strange designes Amongst these simple grosse Arcadians here, That know no other world, but their owne plaines, Nor yet can apprehend the subtle traines We lay, to mocke their rurall ignorance. But see, here comes two of their amorous Swaines In hote contention, let vs close conuay Our selues, here vnderneath this couerture, And ouer heare their passionate discourse. Tech. Colax, this place well such a purpose fits, Let vs sit close, and faith, it shall goe hard, Vnlesse we make some profit by their wits. Carnius. Amyntas. Car. Now found Amyntas, how cam'st thou possest With such a vaine presumption, as thou art, To thinke that Cloris should affect thee best, When all Arcadia knowes I haue her heart? Am. And how Carinus canst thou be so mad, T'imagine Cloris, can, or doth loue thee, When by so many signes as I haue had, I finde her whole affection bent to me? Car. What are those signes by which you come to cast, And calculate the fortune of your hopes? Am. More certaine signes, then thou canst euer shew. Car. But they are more then signes, that I can shew, Am. Why let each then produce the best I can To proue which may be thought the likeliest man. Car. Content Amyntas, and do thou begin. Am. And I am well contented to begin. First if by chance, whil'st she at Barley-breake With other Nymphes, do but perceiue me come, Streight lookes her cheeke with such a Rosie red, As giues the setting Sunne vnto the West When morrow tempests are prefigured. Car. Euen so that hew prognosticates her wrath, Which brings to thee the stormy windes of sighes. Am. And if I finde her with her fellow Nymphes Gathering of stowers by some sweet Riuers side, At my approach she straight way stands vpright, Forgets her worke, and downe lets slide her lap, And out fall all her flowers, vpon the ground. Car. So doth the silly sheepe forget to feed, When it perceiues the greedy Wolfe at hand. Am. And if she meet but with my dog she takes And strokes him on the head playes with his eares, Spits in his mouth, and claps him on the backe, And sayes, come, come Melampus go with me. Car. She may loue what is thine, but yet hate thee. Am. Whilst at a Chrystall spring the other day, She washt her louely face, and seeing me come, She takes vp water with her dainty hand, And with a downe-cast looke besprinckles me. Car. That shewes that shee vvould gladly quench in thee The fire of loue, or else like loue doth beare, As did the Delian Goddesse, vvhen she cast Disdainefull vvater on Acteons face. Am. As Siluia one day, sate vvith her alone, Binding of certaine choice selected hearbes To her left arme against bewitching spels, (And I at the instant comming) shee perceiu'd Her pulse vvith farre more violence to beat (As she'after told me) then it did before. Car. The like is felt vvhen natures enemy, The hatefull feauer doth surprise our powers. Am. And euen but yesternight, she going before With other maides, and seeing me following her, Lees fall this dainty Nosegay, hauing first Bestow'd a kisse thereon to th'end I might Receiue it so, and with it doe the like. Car. Poore withred fauours, they might teach the know, That shee esteemes thee, and thy loue as light As those dead flowers, shee vvore but for a show, The day before, and cast away at night. Am. Now friend Carinus, thou that mutterest so At these plaine speaking figures of her loue, Tell by vvhat signe thou doest her fauours proue? Car. Now silly man, doest thou imagine me So fond to blab the fauours of my loue? Am. Was't not a pack agreed twixt thee &amp; me? Cor. A pact to make thee tell thy secrecy. Am. And hast thou then betrayd my easie trust, And dallied with my open simplenesse? Car. And fitly art thou seru'd. that so wilt vaunt The imagin'd fauours, of a gentle Nymph; And this is that vvhich makees vs feele that dearth Of grace, t'haue kindnes at so hie a rate. This makes them vvary how they doe bestow The least regard of common curtesie, When such as you, poore, credulous deuout, And humble soules, make all things miracles Your faith conceiues, and vainely doe conuert All shadowes to the figure of your hopes. Am. Carinus now thou doest me double wrong. First to deride my easie confidence, And then t'vpbrayd my trust, as if my tongue Had heere prophan'd faire Cloris excellencie, In telling of her mercies, or had sin'd In vttering th'honour of a modest grace Bestowing comfort, in so iust a case. Ca. Why man, thou hast no way deseru'd her loue. Am. Desert I cannot vrge, but faith I can, If that may haue reward, then happy man. Ca. But you know how I sau'd her from the hands Of that rude Satyre, vvho had else vndone Her honour vtterly; and therefore ought My loue of due raigne soueraigne in her thought. Am. But how that free, and vnsubdued heart, Infranchis'd by the Charter of her eyes, Will beare the imposition of a due I doe not see, since loue knew neuer Lord That could command the region of our will. And therefore vrge thy due, I for my part, Must plead compassion, and a faithfull heart. Car. Plead thou thy faith, whilst I will get thy loue, For you kinde soules doe seldome gracefull proue. Am. The more vnkind they, who should better way Our honest vowes, and loue for loue repay, But oft they beare the penance of their will, And for the wrong they doe, they speed as ill. SCEN. III. Colax. Techne. Col. Alas poore fooles, how hotely they contend Who shall possesse a prey that's yet vngot. But Techne, I must by thy helpe forestall The mart of both their hopes, and whilst they shall Pursue the Ayre, I must surprise their gaine. And fitly now thou, maist occasion take By these aduantages discouered here, T'impresse in Choris tender heart that touch Of deepe dislike of both their vanteries, As may conuert her wholly vnto me. Tec. Why will you then Dorindas loue forsake, For whom you traueld so, and made me take Such labour to intice her to your loue? Col. Tush Techne we desire not what we haue, But what we would, our longings neuer stay With our attaynings, but they goe beyond. Tec. And vvhy? Dorinda is as faire as she. Col. That I confesse, but yet that payes not me, For Cloris is another, and tis that, And onely that, vvhich Techne I desire. Some thing there is peculiar, and alone To euery beauty that doth giue an edge To our desires, and more vve vvill conceiue In that vve haue not them in that vve haue. And I haue heard, abroad vvhere best experience, And vvit is learnd, that all the fairest choyce Of vvoemen in the vvorld, serue but to make One perfect beauty, vvhereof each brings part. One hath a pleasing smile, and nothing else: Another but some silly Mole to grace Th'are of a disproportion'd face; Another pleases not but vvhen she speakes, And some in silence onely gracefull are: Some till they laugh, we see, seeme to be faire, Some haue their bodies good, their gestures ill, Some please in Motion, some in sitting still, Some are thought louely, that haue nothing faire, Some againe faire that nothing louely are. So that we see how beauty doth consist Of diuers peeces, and yet all at ract And therefore vnto all my loue aspires, As beauty varies, so doth my desires. Tec. Ah but yet Colax doe not so much wrong Vnto a Nymph, now when thou hast subdu'd And won her heart, and knowst she holdst thee deare. Col. Tush wrong is as men thinke it, and I see It keepes the world the best in exercise That else would languish, and haue nought to doe. Discord in parts, makes harmon in the whole. And some must laugh, whilst other some condole. And so it be not of the side we are. Let others beare it, what neede we to care. And now Dorinda something hath to doe, Now, she may sit, and thinke, and vexe and plot, For ease, and ioyning of her full delight Would but haue dull'd her spirits, and marrd her quite. Tec. Alas, yet I must pitty her poore soule In this distresse, I being on my selfe Of the frayle corporation, and doe know That she will take it very grieuously. And yet in troth sh'is seru'd but well inow, That would neglect Mirtillus honest loue, And trust strong protestations, and new othes, Be wonne with garded words, and gawdy clothes. Col. Well, well, Dorinda shall not waile alone, She shall haue others to consort her mone: For since my last returne from Telos Court I haue made twenty of their coyest Nymphs Turne louers, with a few protesting words And some choyce complementall periuries; I made PalÃ¦mon, to suspect the faith Of his chast Siluia, and chast Siluia his, In hope thereby to worke her loue to me. I wrought coy Daphne to infringe her vow Made to Menalcas, and I told her how Those fetters which so heauily were laid Vpon our free affections, onely were But customary bands, not naturall. And I thinke Techne thou hast done thy part, Here in this gentle region of kind hearts, Since thou cam'st hither, for I see thou thriu'st. Tec. Indeed whilst I in Corinth doe remaine, I hardly could procure the meanes to liue, There were so many of my trade, that sold Complexions, dressings, tiffanies and tyres, Deuisors of new fashions and strange wyers Bedbrokers, Night wormes, and Impressitors That though I knew these arts as well as they Yet being so many we could get small pay. Here, who but Techne now is all in all? Techne is sent for, Techne onely shewes New strange deuises to the choycest Nymphes: And I thinke Techne teaches them those trickes, As they will not forget againe in hast. I haue so opened their vnapt conceits Vnto that vnderstanding of themselues, As they will shew in time they were well taught. If they obserue my rules, and hide a fault. Col. Ah well done Techne. Thus must thou and I Trade for our profit with their ignorance, And take our time, and they must haue their chance. But pray thee Techne, doe not thou forget To lay a traine for Cloris. So adue. Tec. Colax I will not, and the rather too, For that I beare a little leaning loue To sweet Amyntas, for me thinkes he seemes The loueliest Shepheard all Arcadia yeelds And I would gladly intercept his loue. SCEN. IIII. MelibÃ¦us. Ergastus. So this is well, Here's one discouery made; Here are the heads of that distemperature, From whence these strange deban'shments of our Nymphes And vile deluding of our Shepheards springs: Here is a monster, that hath made his lusts As wide as is his will, and left his will Without all bonds, and cares not whom he wrongs, So that he may his owne desires fulfill, And being all foule himselfe, would make all ill. This is that Colax that from forraine lands, Hath brought home that infection that vndoes His countrey goodnesse, and impoysons all. His being abroad would marre vs quite at home. Tis strange to see, that by his going out, He hath out-gone that natiue honesty, Which here the breeding of his countrey gaue. For here I doe remember him a child, The sonne of Nicoginus of the Hill, A man though low in fortune, yet in minde High set, a man still practising T'aduance his forward sonne beyond the traine Of our Arcadian breed, and still me thought I saw a disposition in the youth, Bent to a selfe conceited surlinesse, With an insinuating impudence. Erg. A man the fitter made for Courts abroad Where I would God he had remained still, With those loose-liuing wanton Sybarites, Where luxurie, had made her outmost proofe. From whence I heare he comes, and hither brings Their shames, to brand vs with the like reproach. And for this other viper which you saw, I doe remember how she came of late For succour to these parts, and sought to teach Our younger maides to dresse, and trie our Flaxe, And vse the Distaffe, and to make a hem, And such like skill being skill enough for them, But since I see she hath presum'd to deale In points of other science, different farre From that plaine Art of honest huswifery, And as it seemes hath often made repaire Vnto the neighbour Cities round about, From whom she hath these strange disguises got T'abuse our Nymphes, and as it seemes desires, To sute their mindes, as light as their attires, But we shall soone preuent this growing plague, Of pride, and folly, now that she descry The true symptoma of this malady, And by this ouerture thus made we trust We shortly shall discouer all the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCEN. I. Siluia. Cloris. O Cloris, here haue thou and I full oft Sate and beene merry, in this shady Groue. Here haue we sung full many a Rundelay, Told Riddles, and made Nosegayes, laught at loue, And other passions, whilst my selfe was free, From that intollerable misery, Whereto affection now inuassels me. Now Cloris I shall neuer more take ioy To see, or to be seene, with mortall eye, Now sorrow must be all my company. Clo. Why Siluia, whence should all this griefe arise? Sil. I am vndone Cloris, let that suffice. Clo. Tell me sweet Siluia, how comes that to passe? Sil. O Cloris if thou be as once I was Free, from that miserable plague of loue, Keepe thee so still, let my affliction warne Thy youth, that neuer man haue power to moue Thy heart to liking, for beleeue me this, They are the most vnfaithfull impious race Of creatures on the earth; neuer beleeue Their protestations, nor their vowes, nor teares, All is deceit, none meanes the thing he sweares. Trust a mans faith? nay rather will I goe And giue my selfe a prey to sauage beasts, For all they seeke, and all they labour for, Is but t'vndoe vs, and when that is done, They goe and triumph on the spoile the'haue won. Trust men, or take compassion when they grieue, O Cloris to cherish and relieue The frozen Snake, which with our heat once warmd, Will sting vs to the heart in recompence, And O no maruell tho the Satyre shund, To liue with man, when he perceiu'd he could, With one and the same breath blow heat and cold. Who would haue euer thought PalÃ¦mons othes Would haue prou'd false? who would haue iudgd the face That promis'd so much faith, and honesty? Had beene the visor but of treachery? Clo. Is't possible PalÃ¦mon should b'vntrue? Sil. Tis possible, PalÃ¦mon is vntrue. Clo. If it be so, deare Siluia, I thinke then That thou saist truth, there is no trust in men, For I protest I neuer saw a face That promis'd better of a heart then his, And if he faile, whose faith then constant is? Sil. O Cloris if thou didst but know how long, And with what earnest suite, he sought my loue, What vowes he vs'd, what othes, what teares among, What shewes he made, his constancy to prooue, You would admire: and then againe to see How I although I lou'd him with my heart Stood out, and would by no meanes vrged be, To shew the least affection of my part. For I had heard that, which (O now too well) I finde, that men were cunning, and would not Regard the thing that easily was got. Clo. Siluia, indeed and I haue heard so too. Sil. And therefore I would try him, and not seeme His vowes, nor protestations to esteeme, At length one day, here in this selfe-same place, (Which I shall euer, and good cause I haue To thinke on whilst I liue) walking with me, After he had vrged me most earnestly: O Siluia, said he, since nor oath, nor vow, Nor teares, nor prayers, haue the powers to moue, Nor all that I can doe, can make thee know How true a heart, I offer to thy loue; I must try some way else to shew the same, And make thy vndiscerning wilfull youth Know, though too late, (perhaps vnto thy shame) Thy vvayward error, and my constant truth: When thou maist sigh, and say in griefe of minde, PalÃ¦mon lou'd, and Siluia vvas vnkinde. With that vvringing my hand, he turnes away, And though his teares vvould hardly let him looke, Yet such a looke did through his teares make way, Hs shew'd how sad a farewell there he tooke. And vp towards yonder craggy rocke he goes, His armes incross'd, his head downe on one side, With such a mournfull pace, as shewd his woes Way'd heauier then his passions could abide: Faine vvould I haue recald him backe; but shame, And modestie could not bring forth his name: And faine vvould I haue followed, yet me thought It did not fit the honour of a maide To follow one, yet still I sent from me, T'attend his going, feare, and a carefull eye. At length vvhen he vvas gotten to the top, I might perceiue how vvith infolded armes. And lookes vp bent to heauen, he stands and turnes His vvofull face vnto the other side, Whereas that hideous fearefull downfall is: And seem'd as if he vvould haue throwne him off: And as I thought, vvas now vpon the point: When my affrighted powers could hold no more, But pitty breaking all those bands of shame, That held me back; I shrikd, and ran God knowes, With all the speede my feeble feete could make, And clammering vp at length (vvith much adoe) Breathlesse I got and tooke him by the hand, And glad I had his hand, and vvas not come Too late to haue it, and I puld him backe: But could not speake one vvord, no more did he, Sense seem'd to faile in him, and breath in me. And one before I vvent, and led him on, And downe conducted him into this plaine, And yonder loe, vnder that fatall tree, Looke Cloris there, euen in that very place, We sate vs downe, my arme about his necke, Which Ioue thou know'st held neuer man before: There onely did my teares conferre vvith his, Words we had none, it vvas inough to thinke, For passion vvas too busie now vvithin, And had no time to come abroad in speech. And though I vvould haue spoken, yet me thought I should not, but my silence told him this, That told too much, that all I was was his. Clo. Well Siluia, I haue heard so sad a tale, As that I grieue to be a woman borne, And that by nature we must be expos'd Vnto the mercy of vnconstant men. But what said then PalÃ¦mon in the ende? Sil. Oh what he said, and what deepe vowes he made? When ioy and griefe, had let his senses loose. Witnsse O gentle tree vnder whose shade, We sate the while; witnesse if euer maide Had more assurances by oathes of man. And well may you beare witnesse of this deede, For in a thousand of your barkes he hath Incaru'd my name, and vnder wrote his vowes, Which will remaine so long as you beare bowes. But Cloris, learne this lesson well of mee; Take heed of pitty, pitty was the cause Of my confusion, pitty hath vndone Thousands of gentle natures, in our sexe, For pitty is sworne seruant vnto loue, And this be sure, where euer it begin To make the way, it lets your maister in. Clo. But what assurance haue you of his fraud? It may be you suspect him without cause, Sil. Ah Cloris, Cloris, would I had no cause, He who beheld him wrong me in these woods, And heard him courting Nisa, and protest As deepe to her, as he had done to me, Told me of all his wicked treachery, Clo. Pray who was that? tell me good Siluia, tell. Sil. Why it was Colax, one I know full well Would not report vntruths to gaine the world, A man of vertue, and of worthy parts, He told me all, and more then I will shew I would I knew not halfe of that I know, Ah had he none but Nisa that base trull, The scorne and iest of all Arcadia now To serue his lusts, and falsifie his vow? Ah had it yet beene any else, the touch Of my disgrace, had neuer beene so much But to left for such a one as she, The stale of all, what will folke thinke of me? Cloris in troth, it makes me so much loath My selfe, loath these woods, and euen hate the day, As I must hide my griefes out of the way: I will be gone, Cloris, I leaue thee here, I cannot stay, and prethee, Cloris, yet Pitty thy poore companion Siluias care, And let her fortune make thee to beware. Clo. Siluia adue, the Gods relieue thy woes, Since men thus faile, and loue no pitty showes, SCEN. II. Cloris. Techne. Loue? nay, I'me taught for louing whilst I liue, Siluia, thy counsell hath lockt vp my heart So fast from loue, as let from sigh, and grieue, And pine, and waile who vvill, I for my part Will pitty none of all this race of men. I see vvhat showes soeuer they pretend, Their loue is neuer deadly, none of these That languish thus haue dide of this disease That euer I could heare, I see all do Recouer soone, that happen thereinto. And if they did not, there were no great hurt, They may indure, they are of stronger power, Better their hearts should ake, then they break ours. Well had I not beene thus forewarnd to day, Out of all question, I had shortly falne, Into the melting humour of compassion too; That tender pitty that betrayes vs thus. For something I began to feele, me thought, To moue vvithin me, when as I beheld Amyntas walke, so sadly, and so pale, And euer were I went, still in my way, His lookes bent all to me, his care of mee. Which well I saw, but would not seeme to see. But now he hath his arrent, let him goe, Pitty shall neuer cure that heart of his T'vndoe mine owne, the griefe is best where tis. Tec. What Claris all alone, now fie for shame, How ill doth this become so faire a face, And that fresh youth to be without your loue? Clo. Loue Techne? I haue here as many loues As I intend to haue whilst I haue breath. Tec. Nay that you haue not, neuer hault with me, For I know two at least possessors be Of your kinde fauours as themselues doe boast. Clo. Bost of my fauours, no man rightly can. And otherwise, let them doe what they can. Tec. No Cloris did not you the other night A gallant Nosegay to Amyntas giue? Clo. I neuer gaue him Nosegay in my life. Tec. Then trust me Cloris he doth wrong you much For he produc'd it there in open sight, And vaunted to Carinus, that you first, Did kisse the same, then gaue it vnto him, And tolde too how farre gone you were in loue What passion you would vse, when he was by, How you would iest with him, and wantonly Cast water in his face, call his dogge yours, And shew him your affections by your eye. And then Carinus on the other side He vaunts that since he had redeemed you Out of the Satyres hands, he could command Your loue and all, that you were onely his. This and much more, I heard them protest Giue out of you how truly you know best. Clo. Techne, their idle talke, shall not vexe me I know the ground I stand on, and how free My heart, and I, inioy our librety, And if Amyntas, hath interpreted My lookes according to his owne conceit, He hath mistooke the text, and he shall finde Great difference, twixt his commend, &amp; my minde. And for his Nosegay it shall make me take More care after how I scatter flowers: Let him preserue it well, and let him make Much of his gaines he gets no more of ours. But thus had I beene seru'd, had I reueal'd The least regard of common courtesie To such as these: but I doe thanke the gods I haue reseru'd me, from that vanitie: For euer I suspected this to be The vaine of men, and this now settles me. And for Carinus, let him vaunt what good He did for me, he can but haue againe My hearty thankes, the payment for his paine, And that he shall, and ought in woman hood. And as for loue, let him goe looke on her That sits, and grieues, and languishes for him, Poore Amarillis, who affects him deare, And sought his loue with many a wofull teare. And well deserues a better man then he, Though he be rich Lupinus sonne, and stands Much on his wealth, and his abilitie, She is witty, faire, and full of modestie. And were she of my minde, she rather would Pull out her eyes, than that she would be seene, To offer vp so deare a sacrifice To his wilde youth, that scornes her in that wise. Tec. Cloris in troth, I like thy iudgement well, In not affecting of these home-bred Swaines, That know not how to manage true delight, Can neither hide their loue, nor shew it right. Who would be troubled with grosse ignorance, That vnderstands not truely how to loue? No Cloris, if thou didst but know, how well Thou art esteem'd, of one that knowes indeed How to obserue thy worth, and his owne wayes How to giue true delight, how to proceed With secrecy, and wit, in all assayes, Perhaps you might thinke one day of the man, Clo. What is this creature then you praise a man? Tec. A man? yes Cloris, what should he be else? Clo. Nought else, it is enough he be a man. Tec. Yea and so rare a man as euer yet Arcadia bred, that may be proud she bred A person of so admirable parts, A man that knowes the world, hath seene abrod, Brings those perfections that doe truly moue, A gallant spirit, and vnderstanding loue. O if you did but know how sweet it were, To come vnto the bed of of worthinesse, Of knowledge, of conceits, where strange delights With strange discourses still shall entertaine Your pleased thoughts, with fresh varietie, Ah you would loath to haue your youth confin'de, For euer more betweene the vnskilfull armes Of one of these rude vnconceiuing Swaines, Who would but seeme a trunke without a minde; As one that neuer saw but these poore plaines, Knowes but to keepe his sheepe, and set his fold Pipe on an Oaten Reede, some Rundelayes, And daunce a Morrice on the holy dayes. And so should you be alwayes sweetly sped With ignorance, and two fooles in a bed. But with this other gallant spirit you should Be sure to ouerpasse that tediousnesse, And that society which cloyes this life, With such a variable cheerefulnesse, As you will blesse the time t'haue beene his wife. Clo. What hath this man you thus commend a name? Tec. A name? why yes, no man but hath a name? His name is Colax, and is one I sweare Doth honour euen the ground whereon you tread, And oft, and many times God knowes, Hath he with tender passion, talkt of you? And said; Well, there is one vvithin these vvoods (Meaning by you) that yet of all the Nymphes Mine eyes haue euer seene vpon the earth, In all perfections doth exceede them all. For all the beauties in that glorious Court Of Telos, vvhere I liu'd, nor all the Starres Of Greece beside, could starkle in my heart, The fire of any heate but onely shee. Then vvould he stay, and sigh; and then againe Ah vvhat great pitty such a creature should Be tide vnto a clogge of ignorance, Whose body doth deserue to be imbrac'd, By the most mighty Monarch vpon earth. Ah that she knew her vvorth, and how vnfit That priuate woods should hide that face, that wit. Thus hath he often said, and this I say, Obserue him vvhen you vvill, you shall not see From his hye fore-head to his slender foote, A man in all parts, better made then he. Clo, Techne, me thinkes, the praises that you giue Shewes your owne loue, and if he be that man You say, 'tvvere good you kept him for your selfe. Tec. I must not loue impossibilities, Cloris, he vvere a most fit man for you. Clo. For me, alas Techne you moue too late. Tec. Why haue you past your promise t'any yet? Clo. Yes sure, my promise is already past. Tec. And if it be, I trust you are so wise T'vnpasse the same againe for your owne good. Clo. No that I may not when it is once past. Tec. No Cloris, I presume that wit of yours That is so piersiue, can conceiue how that Our promise must not preiudice our good: And that it is no reason that the tongue, Tie the whole body to eternall wrong. Clo. The Tongue is but the Agent of the heart, And onely as commissioner allowd By reason, and the will, for the whole state, Which warrants all it shall negotiate. Tec. But prithee tell me to what rusticke Swaine You pass'd your word to cast away your selfe? Clo. No I haue past my word to saue my selfe Of treacherous men, and vow'd vnto my heart Vntill I see more faith then yet I see, None of them all shall triumph ouer me. Tec. Nay then, and be no otherwise tis well, We shall haue other time to talke of this. But Cloris I haue fitted you in faith, I haue here brought, the most conceipted tyre, The rarest dressing euer Nymph put on, Worth ten of that you weare, that now me thinkes Doth not become you, and besides tis stale. Clo. Stale why? I haue not worne it scarce a moneth. Tec. A moneth, why you must change them twise a day Hold hither Cloris, this was not well laid, Here is a fault, you haue not mixt it well To make it take, or else it is your haste To come abroad so soone into the Ayre. But I must teach you to amend these faults, And ere I shall haue done with you, I thinke, I shall make some of these inamored youthes To hang themselues, or else runne madde for loue, But goe let's trie this dressing I haue brought. SCEN. III. PalÃ¦mon. Mirtillus. Mirtillus did Dorinda euer vow, Or make thee any promise to be thine? Mir. PalÃ¦mon no, she neuer made me vow, But I did euer hope she would be mine. For that I had deliuered vp my youth, My heart, my all, a tribute to her eyes, And had secur'd her of my constant truth, Vnder so many specialties, As that although she did not grant againe, With any shew the acquittance of my loue, Yet did shee euer seeme to entertaine My affections, and my seruices t'approoue. Till now of late I know not by what meane. (Ill fare that meane) she grew to that dispight, As she not onely clowds her fauours cleane, But also scorn'd to haue me in her sight. That now I am not for her loue thus mou'd, But onely that she will not be belou'd. Pal. If this be all th'occasion of thy griefe, Mirtillus, thou art then in better case Then I suppos'd, and therefore cheere thy heart, And good cause too, being in the state thou art, For if thou didst but heare the History Of my distresse, and what part I haue shar'd Of sad affliction, thou wilt then soone see There is no misery vnlesse compar'd. For all Arcadia, all these hills, and plaines, These holts, and woods and euery Christall spring. Can testifie my teares, and tell my flames, And with how cleane a heart, how cleere a faith PalÃ¦mon loued Siluia, and how long. And when consum'd with griefe, and dri'd with care, Euen at the point to sacrifice my life Vnto her cruelty, then lo she yeelds, And was content for euer to be mine: And gaue m'assurance vnderneath her hand, Sign'd with a faithfull vow, as I conceiu'd, And witnessed with many a louely kisse, That I thought sure I had attain'd my blisse, And yet (aie me) I got not what I got, Siluia I haue, and yet I haue her not. Mir. How may that be, PalÃ¦mon pray thee tell? Pal. O know Mirtillus that I rather could Runne to some hollow caue, and burst and die In darknes, and in horror, then vnfold Her shamefull staine, and mine owne infamy. But yet it will abroad, her impudence Will be the trumpet of her owne disgrace, And fill the wide and open mouth of fame So full, as all the world shall know the same. Mir. Why what is Siluia false, or is she gone? Pal. Siluia is false and I am quite vndone. Mil. Ah out alas who euer would haue thought, That modest looke, so innocent a face, So chast a blush, that shame-fast countenance, Could euer haue told how to wantonise? Ah what shall we poore louers hope for now Who must to win, consume, and hauing wonne With hard and much adoe must be vndone? Pal. Ah but Mirtillus if thou didst know who Is now the man, her choice hath lighted on, How would'st thou wonder, for that passes all, That I abhoore to tell, yet tell I shall; For all that would will shortly know't too well: It is base Thirsis that wild hare-braine youth Whom euer milk-maid in Arcadia skornes: Thyrsis is now the man with vvhome she walkes Alone, in thickets, and in groues remote. Thyrsis is all in all, and none but he, With him she dallies vnder euery tree, Trust women? ah Mirtillus, rather trust The Summer windes, th'Oceans constancy, For all their substance is but leuity: Light are their wauing vailes, light their attires, Light are their heads, and lighter their desires: Let them lay on vvhat couerture they will Vpon themselues, of modesty and shame, They cannot hide the woman with the same, Trust women? ah Mirtillus rather trust The false deuouring Crocodiles of Nile, For all they worke is but deceipt and guile: What haue they but is fain'd? their haire is fain'd, Their beauty fain'd, their stature fain'd, their pace, Their iesture, motion, and their grace is fain'd: And if that all be fain'd without, vvhat then Shall we suppose can be sincere within? For if they doe but vveepe, or sing, or smile, Smiles, teares, and tunes, are ingins to beguile; And all they are, and all they haue of grace, Consists but in the out-side of a face, O loue and beauty, how are you ordain'd Like vnto fire, vvhose flames farre off delight, But if you be imbrac'd consume vs quite? Why cannot vve make at a lower rate A purchase of you, but that we must giue The treasure of our hearts, and yet not haue What we haue bought so dearely for all that? O Siluia if thou needs wouldst haue beene gone, Thou should'st haue taken all away of thee; And nothing left to haue remain'd with me. Thou should'st haue carried hence the portracture VVhich thou hast left behind within my heart, Set in the table-frame of memory, That puts me still in minde of what thou wert, VVhilst thou wert honest, and thy thoughts were pure, So that I might not thus in euery place. VVhere I shall set my carefull foote, conferre VVith it of thee, and euermore be told, That here sate Siluia vnderneath this tree, And here she walkt, and lean'd vpon mine arme, There gathered flowers, and brought them vnto me. Here by the murmurs of this rusling spring, She sweetly lay, and in my bosome slept: Here first she shewd me comforts when I pinde: As if in euery place her foote had stept, If had left Siluia in a print behind. But yet, O these were Siluias images, Then whilst her heart held faire, and she was chaste, Now is her face all sullied with her fact, And why are not those former prints defac'd? VVhy should she hold, still in the forme she was, Being now deform'd, and not the same she was? O that I could Mirtillus locke her out Of my remembrance, that I might no more Haue Siluia here, vvhen she will not be here. Mir. But good PalÃ¦mon, tell vvhat proofes hast thou Of her disloyality, that makes thee show These heauy passions, and to grieue so much? Pal. Mirtillus, proofes, that are alas too plaine; For Colax one thou knowst can well obserue And iudge of loue, a man both staid, and wise, A gentle heardsman, out of loue, and care He had of me, came and reported all: And how he saw them diuers times alone, Imbracing each the other in the woods. Besides she hath of late with sullaine lookes, That shew'd disliking, shunn'd my company, Kept her a loofe, and novv I thinke to day, Is gone to hide her quite out of the vvay. But Siluia though thou go and hide thy face, Thou canst not hide thy shame, and thy disgrace, No secret thicket, groue, nor yet close grot, Can couer shame, and that immodest blot. Ah didst thou lend thy hand in kind remorse, To saue me from one death, to giue m'a worse? Had it not yet beene better I had died, By the vnspotted honest cruelty, Then now by thy disgraced infamy? That so I might haue carried to my graue, The image of chaste Siluia in my heart, And not haue had these notions, to ingraue A stained Siluia there, as now thou art? Ah yes, it hath beene better farre, I prooue, T'haue perisht for thy loue, then vvith thy loue. Mir. Ah good PalÃ¦mon cease these sad complaints, And moderate thy passions, thou shalt see She may returne, and these reports be found But idle fictions on vncertaine ground. Pal. Mirtillus I perceiue my tedious tale, Begins to be distastefull to thine eare, And therefore will I to some desert vale, To some close groue to waile, where none shall heare But beasts, and trees, whose sense I shall not tyre. VVith length of mone, for length is my desire. And therefore gentle Sheepheard, now adieu, And trust not women, for they are vntrue. Mir. Adue PalÃ¦mon, and thy sad distresse, Shall make me weigh Dorindas losse the lesse: For if I should be hers, and she prooue so, Better to be mine owne and let her go. SCEN. IV. Ergastus. MelibÃ¦us. Now MelibÃ¦us; who would haue suppos'd That had not seene these impious passages, That euer monstrous wretch could haue expos'd, To honest hearts to these extremity, T'attaine his wicked ends? by hauing wrought First in, their easie confidence Away, by an opinion to be thought, Honest, discreet, of great experience. Whereby we see open-fast villanie Without a maske, no mischiefe could haue done, It was the couerture of honesty, That laid the snare, whereby they were vndone, And that's the ingine that confounds vs all, That makes the breach whereby the world is sackt, And made a prey to cunning, when we fall Into the hands of wise dishonesty: When as our weake credulity is rackt By that opinion of sufficiency, To all the inconueniences that guile, And impious craft can practise to beguile. And note but how these cankers alwayes seaze The choysest fruits with their infections, How they are still ordained to disease, The natures of the best complections. Mel. Tis true. And what an instrument hath he there got, To be the Agent of his villany? How truely she negotiate, and doth plot, To vndermine fraile imbecillity. How strong, these spirits combine them in a knot, To circumvent plaine open honesty? And what a creature there is no conuerse With feeble maydes, whose vveaknes soone is led VVith toyes, and new disguises, to reuerse The course wherein by custome they vvere bred; And when that fitnesse too her trade affoords, To trafficke with the secrets of their heart, And cheapen their affections vvith faire words. VVhich vvomen straight to women vvill impart? And then to see how soone example vvill Disperse it selfe, being met with our desire? How soone, it vvill inkindle others ill, Like Neptha that takes fire by sight of fire? So that vnlesse we runne vvith all the speed VVe can, to quench this new arising flame O vanity, and lust, it will proceed T'vndoe vs, ere vve shall perceiue the same: How farre already is the mischiefe runne, Before vve scarse perceiu'd it was begunne?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCEN. I. Alcon. Lincus. VVhat my friend Lincus? now in troth tell me, Lin. VVell met good Alcon, this fals happily That we two thus incoumer all alone, VVho had not any conference scarse this moneth. Al. In troth I long'd to heare how you proceed, In your new practise, here among these swaines, For you and I must grace each others arte; Though you knew me, vvhen I in Patras dwelt, And waited on a poore Phisitions man, And I knew you a Pronotories boy. That wrote Indentures at the towne-house-doore. Yet are you here, now a great man of law, And I a graue Phisition full of skill, And here we two are held the only men. But how thriue you in your new practise now? Lin. Alcon in troth not any thing to speake, For these poore people of Arcadia here, Are soone contented each man with his owne, As they desire no more, nor will be drawne To any contestation, nor indeed Is there any frame compos'd, whereby Contention may proceed in practicke forme? For if they had this for me once to contend. Then would they brawle and wrangle without end. For then might they be taught, and councell'd how To litigate perpetually you know; And so might I be sure to doe some good: But hauing here no matter whereupon To furnish reall actions, as else where; No tenures, but a constumary hold Of what they haue from their progenitors Common, without indiuiduitie; No purchasings, no contracts, no comerse, No politique commands, no seruices, No generall assemblies but to feast, And to delight themselues with fresh pastimes, How can I hope that euer I shall thriue? Alc. Ist possible that a societie Can with so little noyse, and sweat subsist? Lin. It seemes it may before men haue transform'd Their state of nature in so many shapes Of their owne managements, and are cast out Into confusion, by their knowledges. And either I must packe me hence, or else Must labour wholly to dissolue the frame, And composition, of their strange built state. Which now I seeke to doe, by drawing them To appr'hend of these proprieties Of mine and thine and teach them to incroch And get them states apart, and priuate shares. And this I haue already set a worke If it vvill take, for I haue met with two The aptest spirits the countrey yeelds, I know, Montanus and Acrypsus, vvho are both Old, and both cholericke, and both peruerse, And both inclinable to Auarice And if their quarrell hold, as tis begun I doe not doubt but all the rest vvill on. And if the vvorst should fall, if I could gaine The reputation but to arbitrate, And sway their strifes, I vvould get vvell by that. Alc. Tis maruell that their long and easie peace That fosters plenty, and giues nought to doe, Should not vvith them beget contention too, As vvell as other vvhere vve see it doth. Lin. This peace of theirs, is not like others peace Where craft laies trapst'inrich himselfe with wiles, And men make prey of men, and rise by spoiles. This rather seemes a quiet then a peace, For this poore corner of Arcadia here, This little angle of the vvorld you see, Which hath shut out of doore, all t'earth beside, And are bard vp with mountaines, and with rocks; Haue had no intertrading with the rest, Of men, nor yet will haue, but here alone, Quite out of fortunes way, and vnderneath Ambition, or desire, that weighes them not, They liue as if still in the golden age, When as the world was in this pupillage. But for mine owne part, Alcon I protest I enuy them that they thus make themselues, An euerlasting holy day of rest, Whiles others worke, and I doe thinke it fit Being in the world, they should be of the world, And if that other starres should doe so too As God forbid, what should we Lawyers doe? But I hope shortly yet; we shall haue here As many of vs as are other where: And we shall sweat, and chafe, and talke as loud, Brawle our selues hoarse, as well as they doe At Patras, Sparta, Corinth, or at Thebes, And be as arrogant and euen as proud, And then 'twill be a world, and not before. But how dost thou with thy profession frame? Alc. No man can wish a better place then this To practise in my arte, for here they will Be sicke for company, they are so kinde, I haue now twenty Pacients at this time, That know not vvhat they ayle, no more doe I, And they haue Physicke all accordingly. First Phillis got running at Barley-breake A little cold, vvhich I vvith certaine drugs I ministred, vvas thought to remedie, Doris saw that, how Phillis Physicke wrought (For Phillis had told her, she neuer tooke So delicate a thing in all her life That more reuiu'd her heart, and clear'd her blood,) Doris would needs be sicke too, and take some. Melma seeing that, she would the like, And so she had the very same receit, For so faith troth I haue no more but that And one poore pill I vse for greater cures. But this is onely sweet and delicate, Fit for young women, and is like th'hearbe Iohn, Doth neither good nor hurt, but that's all one, For if they but conceiue it doth, it doth And it is that Physitions hold the chiefe In all their cures, conceit, and strong beliefe: Besides I am a stranger come from farr Which doth adde much vnto opinion too. For who now but th'Arabian or the Iew In forraine lands, are held the onely men, Although their knowledge be no more then mine. Lin. Tis true friend Alcon, he that hath once got, Th'Elixit of opinion hath got all, And h'is th'man that turnes his brasse to gold. Then can I talke of Gallen, Auerrois, Hypocratis, Rasis, and Auicon And booke I neuer read, and vse strange speach Of Symptons, Crysis, and the Critique dayes. Of Trochises, Opiats, Apophilegmatismes, Eclegmats, Embrochs, Lixiues, Cataplasmes, With all the hideous tearmes Arte can deuise, T'amuse weake, and admiring ignorance. Lin. And that is right my tricke, I ouerwhelme My practise too, with darknes, and strange words, With Paragraphs, Conditions, Codicilles, Acceptilations, actions, recissorie, Noxall, and Hypothecall, and inuolue Domesticke matter in a forraine phrase. Alc. Then am I as abstruse and mysticall, In Carecteer, and giuing my receit, Obseruing th'odde number in my pills, And certaine houres to gather and compound My simples, and make all t'attend the Moone. Then doe I shew the rare ingredients I vse for some great cures, when need requires, The liuer of a Wolfe, the Lyons gall, The left side of a Moles, the Foxes heart, The right foote of a Tortuse, Dragons blood, And such strange sauage stuffe, as euen the names Are physicke of themselues, to moue a man. And all the drugs I vse, must come from farre, Beyoung the Ocean, and the Sunne at least, Or else it hath no vertue Physicall, These home-bred simples doe no good at all. Lin, No, no, it must be forraine stuffe, God wot, Or something else that is not to be got. Al. But now in faith I haue found out a tricke, That will perpetually so seede their rheumes, And entertaine their idle vveakenesses, As nothing in the vvorld could doe the like, for lately being at Corinth, 'twas my chance T'incounter vvith a Sea-man, new arriu'd Of Alexandria, vvho from India came, And brought a certaine hearbe wrapt vp in rowles, From th'Island of Nicosia, vvhere it growes: Infus'd I thinke in some pestiferous iuice. (Produc'd in that contagious burning clime, Contrarious to our nature, and our spirits) Or else steep'd in the fuming sap, it selfe Doth yeeld, t'inforce th'infecting power thereof, And this in powder made, and fir'd, he suckes Out of a little hollow instrument Of calcinated clay, the smoake thereof: Which either he conuayes out of his nose, Or downe into his stomacke vvith a vvhiffe. And this he said a vvondrous vertue had, To purge the head, and cure the great Catarre, And to dry vp all other meaner rhumes, Which vvhen I saw, I straight vvay thought how vvell This new fantasticall deuise vvould please The foolish people here growne humorous. And vp I tooke all this commoditie, And here haue taught them how to vse the same. Lin. And it is easie to bring in the vse Of any thing, though neuer so absurd, When nations are prepar'd to all abuse, And th'humour of corruption once is stird. Alc. Tis true, and now to see with what a strange And gluttonous desire, th'exhaust the same How infinite, and how insatiably, They doe deuoure th'intoxicating fume, You vvould admire, as if their spirits thereby Were taken, and inchanted, or transformd, By some infused philter in the drug. For vvhereas heretofore they vvonted vvere, At all their meetings, and their festiualls, To passe the time in telling vvitty tales, In questions, riddles, and in purposes, Now doe they nothing else, but sit and sucke, And spit, and slauer, all the time they sit. That I goe by, and laugh vnto my selfe, And thinke that this wil one day make some worke For me or others, but I feare it vvill B'another age will finde the hurt of this. But sure the time's to come when they looke backe On this, vvill vvonder vvith themselues to thinke That men of sense could euer be so mad, To sucke so grosse a vapour, that consumes Their spirits, sends nature, dries vp memorie, Corrupts the blood, and in a vanitie. Lin. But Alcon peace, here comes a patient, peace. Al. Linthus there doth indeed, therefore away, Leaue me alone, for I must not resume My surely, graue, and Doctorall aspect. This wench I know, tis Daphne who hath wrong'd Her loue Menalcus, and plaid fast and loose With Colax, vvho reueald the whole to me. SCEN. II. Daphne. Alcon. Good Doctor Alcon, I am come to craue Your counsell to aduise me for my health, For I suppose, in troath, I am not well, Me thinkes I should be sicke, yet cannot tell: Some thing there is amisse that troubles me, For which I would take Phisicke willingly, Alc. Welcome, faire Nymph, come let me try your pulse. I cannot blame you t'hold your selfe not well. Something amisse quoth you, here's all amisse, Th'whole Fabricke of your selfe distempred is, The Systole, and Dyastole of your pulse, Doe shew your passions most hystericall, It seemes yoo haue not very carefull beene, T'obserue the prophilactick regiment Of your owne body, so that we must now Descend vnto the Theraphenticall; That so we may preuent the syndrome Of Symtomes, and may afterwards apply Some analepticall Elexixharmacum, That may be proper for your maladie: It seemes faire nimph you dream much in the night Dap. Doctor I doe indeed, Alc. I know you doe, Y'are troubled much with thought. Dap. I am indeed, Alc. I know you are. You haue great heauinesse about your heart. Dap. Now truly so I haue. Alc. I know you haue. You wake oft in the night. Dap. In troath I doe. Alc. All this I know you doe. And this vnlesse by physicke you preuent, Thinke whereto it may bring you in the end, And therefore you must first euacuate All those Colaxicall hote humour which Disturbe your heart, and then refrigerate Your blood by some Menalchian Cordials, Which you must take, &amp; you shal straight find ease, And in the morning I will visit you. Dap. I pray Sir, let me take of that you gaue, To Phillis th'other day, for that she said, Did comfort wonderfully, and cheere her heart. Alc. Faire nimph, you must, if you wil vse my art, Let me alone, to giue vvhat I thinke good, I knew what fitted Phillis maladie, And so, I thinke, I know what will fit you. Exit. Daphne sola. O what a wondrous skill man is this? Why he knowes all? O God, who euer thought Any man liuing, could haue told so right A womans griefe in all points as he hath? Why this is strange that by my very pulse, He should know all I ayle, as well as I. Beside I feare he sees too much in mee, More then I would that any man should see. Me thought (although I could not well conceiue His words, he spake so learned and so strange) He said I had misruld my body much, As if he meant that in some wanton sort, I had abus'd my body with some man: O how should he know that? what is my pulse Become the intelligencer of my shame? Or are my lookes the index of my heart? Sure so he said, and me thought too, he nam'd Menalcas, or else something very like, And likewise nam'd that cunning treacherous wretch That hath vndone me, Colax, that vile Diuell, Who is indeed the cause of all my griefe, For which I now seeke Physicke, but O what Can Physicke doe to cure that hideous wound My lusts haue giuen my Conscience? which I see Is that which onely is diseas'd within And not my body now, that's it doth so Disquiet all the lodging of my spirits, As keepes me waking, that is it presents Those onely formes of terror that affright My broken sleepes, that layes vpon my heart This heauy loade that weighes it downe with griefe; And no disease beside, for which there is No cure I see at all, nor no redresse. Didst thou alleadge vile man to my weake youth, How that those vowes I made vnto my loue Were bands of custome, and could not lay on Those manicles on nature, vvhich should keepe Her freedome prisoner by our dome of breath? O impious wretch now nature giues the lye To thy foule heart and tels my grieued soule, I haue done vvrong, to falsifie that vow I first to my deare loue Menalcas made. And sayes th'assurance and the faith is giuen By band on earth, the same is seal'd in Heauen. And therefore now Menalcas can these eyes That now abhorre to looke vpon my selfe, Dare euer view that vvronged face of thine, Who hast relide on this false heart of mine? SCEN. III. Colax. Techne. Ist possibl sweete Techne, what you say, That Cloris is so witty, and so coy? Tec. Tis as I tell you Colax, sh'is as coy And hath as shrewd a spirit, as quicke conceipt As euer wench I brok'd in all my life. Col. Then there's some glory in attaining her, Here now I shall be sure t'haue something yet Besides dull beauty, I shall lay vvith wit. For these faire creatures, haue such feeble spirits, And are so languishing, as giue no edge To appetite, and loue, but stuffes pelight. Tec. Well if you get her, then you shall be sure To haue your vvish; and yet perhaps that store, You find in her, may checke your longing more Then all their wants, whom you haue tride before. Col. How? if I get her, what doe you suppose, I shall not get her, that were very strange. Tec. Yes sir, she may be got, but yet I know Sh'will put you to the triall of your wit. Col. Let me alone, could I find season fit To talke with her in priuate, she vvere mine. Tec. That season may you now haue very well. For Colax, she hath promis'd faithfully This euening late to meete me at the caue Of Erycina vnderneath the hill, Where I must fit her vvith a new attyre Where vvith sh's farre in loue, and th'other day Thinking to try it at her fathers house, Whether I went vvith her to deale for you) The old Acrysius was himselfe at home. VVhich did inforce vs to deferre our worke Vntill this euening, that we might alone There out of sight, more closely do the same: Where while she stayes (for I will make her stay For me a while) you at your pleasure may Haue th'opportunity vvhich you desire. Col. O Techne thou hast blest me, if I now On this aduantage conquer not her mind, Let me be loathed of all vvoman-kind. And presently will I go sute my selfe As brauely as I can, go set my lookes Arme my discourse, frame speaches passionate And action both, fit for so great a worke, Techne a thousand thankes and so adieu. Ex. Tec. Well Colax, she may yet deceiue thy hopes, And I perswade my selfe she is as like, As any subtile vvench was euery borne, To giue as wise a man as you the skorne: But see where one whose faith hath better right Vnto her loue then you, comes here forlorne Like fortunes out-cast, full of heauines. Ah poore Amyntas, vvould thou knewst how much Thou art esteem'd, although not vvhere thou wouldst, Yet vvhere thou should haue loue in that degree, As neuer liuing man had like to thee. Ah see how I, who sets for others loue, Am tooke my selfe, and intricated here With one, that hath his heart another where? But I vvill labour to diuert the streame Of his affections, and to turne his thoughts From that coy Cloris, to the liberty Of his owne heart, vvith hope to make him mine. SCEN. IIII. Techne. Amyntas. Now sie Amyntas, why should you thus grieue For a most foolish vvay-ward girle, that scornes Your honest loue, and laughes at all you doe; For shame Amyntas let her go as sh'is. You see her vaine, and how peruersly set, Tis fond to follow vvhat we cannot get. Am. O Techne, Techne, though I neuer get, Yet will I euer follow vvhilst I breath, And if I perish by the vvay, yet shall My death be pleasing that for her I die. And one day she may hap to come that way, (And be it, O her way) where I shall lye, And with her proud disdainefull foote she may Tread on my tombe, and say, loe where he lies, The tryumph, and the conquest of mine eyes. And though I loose my selfe, and loose my teares, It shall be glory yet that I was hers. VVhat haue I done of late, should make her thus My presence with that strange disdaine to flye, As if she did abhorre my company? Cloris God knowes, thou hast no cause therefore, Vnlesse it be for louing more, and more. Why thou wert vvont to lend me yet an eare, And though thou wouldst not helpe, yet wouldst thou heare Tec. Perhaps she thinkes thy heat will be allayd, The fire being gone, and therefore doth she well Not to be seene there vvhere she vvill not aide. Am. Alas she knowes no hand but her can quench That heat in me, and therefore doth she vvrong To fire my heart, and then to runne away, And if she would not aide, yet might she ease My carefull soule, if she vvould but stand by And only looke vpon me while I die. Tec. Well well Amyntas, little doest thou know With vvhom that cunning vvanton sorts her selfe. Whil'st thus thou mourn'st, and vvith that secrets wiles She vvorkes, to meet her louer in the vvoods, With whom in groues, and caues she dailying sits, And mockes thy passions and thy dolefull fits, Am. No Techne, no I know that cannot be, And therefore do not vvrong her modesty, For Cloris loues no man, and that's some ease Vnto my griefe, and giues a hope that yet If euer soft affection touch her heart, She will looke backe, and thinke on my desert. Tec. If that be all, that hope is at an end, For if thou wilt this euening but attend And walke downe vnder Erycinas groue, And place thy selfe in some close secret bush, Right opposite vnto the hollow caue That lookes into the vally, thou shalt see That honesty, and that great modesty. Am. If I see Cloris there, I know I shall See nothing else vvith her, but modesty. Tec. Yes something els will grieue your heart to see: But you must be content, and thinke your selfe Are not the first that thus haue bin deceiu'd, With faire appearing out-sides, and mistooke A wanton heart, by a chast seeming looke. But I coniure you by the loue you beare Vnro those eyes which make you (as you are Th'example of compassion to the world) Sit close and be not seene in any case. Am. Well Techne, if I shall see Cloris there It is enough, then thither will I goe, Who will go and any where to looke on her. And Cloris know, I do not go to see, Any thing else of thee, but only thee. Tec. Well go and thinke yet of her honest care, VVho giues the note of such a shamefull deed, And iudge Amyntas when thou shalt be free, VVho more deserues thy loue, or I or she. SCEN. V. MelibÃ¦us. Ergastus. Now what infernall proiects are here laid, T'afflict an honest heart, t'expose a maide, Vnto the danger of alone assault, To make her to offend without her fault. Er. And see what other new appearing spirits Would raise the tempests of disturbances Vpon our rest, and labour to bring in All the whole Ocean of vnquietnesse, To ouerwhelme the poore peace we liue in? How one would faine instruct, and teach vs how To cut our throates with forme, and to contend VVith artificiall knowledge, to vndoo Each other, and to brabble without end. As if that nature had not tooke more care For vs, then we for our owne selues can take, And makes vs better lawes then those we make. And as if all that science ought could giue Vnto our blisse, but onely shewes vs how The better to contend, but not to liue. And euermore we see how vice doth grow With knowledge, and brings forth a more increase, When skilfull, men begin, how good men cease. And therefore how much better do vve liue, With quiet ignorance, then vve should do With turbulent and euer vvorking skill, Which makes vs not to liue, but labour still. Mel. And see that other vaine fantasticke spirit, Who vvould corrupt our bodies too likewise, As this our mindes, and make our health to be, As troublesome as sicknesse, to deuise, That no part of vs euer should be free; Both forraging our credulity, Take still th'aduantage of our weakenesses; Both cloath their friuolous vncertainties In strange attires, to make it seeme the lesse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS. IV. SCENA. I. Techne. Amyntas. Amyntas must come backe I know this vvay, And here it will be best for me to stay, And here, indeed he comes, poore man I see All quite dismayd: and now ile worke on him. Come, vvho tels troth Amyntas, vvho deceiues Your expectation now, Cloris, or I? Am. Peace Techne peace, and do not interrupt The griefe that hath no leasure to attend Ought but it selfe, and hath shut vp vvith it All other sense in priuate close within, From doing any thing, but onely thinke. Tec. Thinke? whereon should you think? y'haue thought enough And too too much, on such a one as she, Whom now you see y'haue tride her honesty: And let her goe proud girle accordingly, There's none of these young vvanton things that know How t'vse a man, or how to make their choyse, Or answere mens affections as they ought. And if y'will thinke, thinke sh'is not worth a thought. Am. Good Techne, leave me for thy speech and sight Beare both that disproportion to my griefe, As that they trouble, trouble, and confound Confusion in my sorrowes, vvhich doth loath That sound of words, that answeres not the tone Of my disprayers in th'accents of like mone. And now hath sorrow no vvorse plague I see, Then free and vnpartaking company, Who are not in the fashion of our vvoes, And whose affection do not looke likewise Of that complection as our miseries? And therefore pray thee leaue me, or else leaue To speake, or if thou speake let it not be To me, or else let me, not answere thee. Tec. Well I say nothing, you know vvhat y'haue seene, Am. Tis true, I do confesse that I haue seene The vvorst the world can shew me, and the worst That can be euer seene vvith mortall eye. I haue beheld the whole of all wherein My heart had any interest in this life; To be disrent and to me from of my hopes, That nothing now is least, why I should liue: That ostage I had giuen the world, which was The hope of her, that held me to hold truce With it, and with this life is gone, and now Well may I breake with them, and breake I will And rend that pact of nature, and dissolue That league of blood that ties me to my selfe. For Cloris now hath thy immodesty Infranchiz'd me, and made me free to dye: VVhich otherwise I could not lest it might Haue beene some staine and some disgrace to thee. Ah was it not enough for this poore heart T'indure the brden of her proud disdaine? That weigh'd it to the earth but it must Be crusht thus vvith th'oppression of her staine? The first vvound yet though it were huge and wide, Yet was it cleanely made, it festred not, But this now giuen, comes by a poysoned shot, Against all lawes of honor that are pure, And rankles deadly is vvithout all cure. Ah how she blusht vvhen as she issued forth VVith her inamor'd mate out of the caue? And well then might she blush at such a deed, And with how vvild a looke she casts about Her fearefull eyes? as if her loathsome sinne Now comming thus into the open sight, VVith terror did her guiltinesse affright; And vp she treades the hill vvith such a pace. As if she gladly would haue out gone shame, Which yet for all her hasting after came. And at their comming forth, me thought I heard The villaine vse my name, and she returne The same againe in very earnest sort, Which could be for no good I know to me, But onely that perhaps it pleas'd her then To cast me vp by this way of her mouth From of her heart, lest it might stuffe the same. But Cloris know thou shalt not need to feare. I neuer more shall interrupt thy ioyes With my complaints, nor more obserue thy waies; And O I would thy heart could be as free From sinne and shame, as thou shalt be from me. I could (and I haue reason so to do) Reuenge my wrong vpon that wicked wretch, Who hath surpriz'd my loue, and robb'd thy shame, And make his blood th'oblation of my wrath Euen at thy feete, that thou might'st see the same To expiate, for this vniustice done, But that the fact examin'd would display Thy infamy abroad vnto the world, Which I had rather die then once bewray. And Techne pray-thee, tell her thus from me, But yet, ah tell it softly in her eare, And be thou sure no liuing creature heare. That her immodesty hath lost this day; Two the most honest guardians of her good She had in life, her honour, and my blood. Tec. Now I may speake I trust you speake to me. Am. No not yet Techne, pray-thee stay a while, And tell her too, though she spares not her shame, My death shall shew, that I respect her fame. Tec. Then now I may. Am. O Techne no not yet. And bid her not forget Amyntas faith, Though she despised him, and one day yet She may be toucht with griefe, and that ere long, To thinke on her dishonour, and his wrong, Now Techne I haue done, and so farewell. Tec. But stay Amyntas, now must I begin. Am. I cannot stay Techne, let goe your hold, It is in vaine I say, I must be gone. Tec. Now deare Amyntas, heare me but one word. Ah he is gone, and in that fury gone, As sure he vvill in this extremity Of his dispaire, do violence to himselfe: And therefore now vvhat helpe shall I deuise To stay his ruine? sure there is no meanes But to call Cloris, and perswade with her To follovv him, and to preuent his death; For though this practise vvas for mine owne good Yet my deceipts vse not to stretch to blood. But now I know not vvhere I should finde out That cruell mayde, but I must cast about. SCEN. II. Amarillis. Dorinda. Dorinda, you are yet in happy case, You are belou'd, you need not to complaine; 'Tis I haue reason onely to bewaile My fortunes, who am cast vpon disdaine, And on his rockey heart that wrackes my youth With stormes of sorrowes, and contemnes my truth; 'Tis I that am shut out from all delight This vvorld can yeeld a mayd, that am remou'd From th'onely ioy on earth, to be belou'd: Cruell Charinus sknornes this faith of mine, And lets poore Amarillis grieue and pine. Do. Tis true indeed you say, I am belou'd, Sweete Amarillis, and perhaps much more Then I vvould be: plenty doth make me poore, For now my heart, as if deuided stands Betwixt two passions, loue, and pitty both, That draw it either way vvith that maine force, As that I know not vvhich to yeeld vnto: And then feare in the midd'st, holds m'in suspence, Lest I lose both by mine improuidence. Ama. How may that be Dorinda? you know this, You can enioy but one, and one there is Ought to possesse your heart, and loue a lone, Who hunts two Hares at one time, catches none. Do. I must tell you deare friend the whole discourse From vvhom I cannot any thing conceale, Arcadia knowes, and euery Shepheard knowes How much Mirtillus hath deseru'd of me, And how long time his woefull sute hath laine, Depending on the mercie of mine eyes, For whom I doe confesse, pitty hath beene Th'Atturny euermore that stands and pleades Before my heart, the iustice of his cause, And saies he ought haue loue, by loues owne lawes. But now the maister sou'raigne Lord of hearts. That great commander, and that tyrant loue, Who must haue all according to his will, Whom pitty onely vshers goes before, As lightning doth the thunder, he sayes no, And vvill that Colax onely haue my heart, That gallant heardsman full of skill and arte? And all experience of loues mysteries, To whom I must confesse me to haue giuen The carnest of my loue; but since that time I neuer saw the man, vvhich makes me much To wonder that his dealing should be such: For either loue, hath (in respect that I Despised haue the true and honest faith, Of one that lou'd me with sincerity,) Made me the spoyle of falshood and contempt, Or else perhaps the same is done to trye My resolution, and my constancy. But yet I feare the worst, and feare I may, Lest he now hauing got the victory, Cares for no more: and seeing he knowes my loue Turnes towards him, he turnes his backe to me. So that I know not vvhat vvere best resolue, Either to stand vnto the doubtfull faith Of one that hath so dangerously begun, Or else returne t'accept Mirtillus loue, Who vvill perhaps when mine begins, haue done: So that inwrapt in this distracted toyle I vexe, and know not vvhat to do the vvhile. And therefore Amarillis I thinke sure Se'ing now how others loue in me hath prou'd) You are most happy not to be belou'd. SCEN. III. Cloris. Amarillis. Dorinda, Now here betweene you two, kind louing soules, I know there can be no talke but of loue, Loue must be all the scope of your discourse, Alas poore hearts, I vvonder how you can In this deceiptfull vvorld thinke of a man. For they doe nothing but make fooles of you, And laugh vvhen they haue done, and prooue vntrue. Am. Well Cloris vvell, reioyce that you are free You may be toucht one day as vvell as we. Clo. Indeed and I had like to this last night, Had I not lookt vvith such an angry eye, And frown'd so sowre, that I made loue afeard, There vvas a fellow needes forsooth would haue My heart from me vvhether I would or not, And had as great aduantage one could haue, I tell you that he had me in a Caue, Do. What in a Caue? Cloris how came you there? Clo. Truely Dorinda I vvill tell you how: By no arte magique, but a plaine deuise Of Techne, vvho would trie her wit on me, For she had promis'd me, to meete me there At such an houre, and thither bring vvith her A new strange dressing she had made for me, Which there close out of sight, I should trie on: Thither vvent I poore foole, at th'houre decreed. And there expecting Technes company, In rushes fleering Colax after me. Whom sure she sent of purpose to the place, And there with his affected apish grace And strained speach, offring to seaze on me, Out rusht I from him, as indeed amaz'd At his so sodaine and vnexpected sight. And after followes he, vowes, sweares, protests By all the gods, he neuer lou'd before Any one liuing in the world but me, And for me onely, would he spend his life. Do. Alas, and what am I forgotten then? Why these were euen the words he spake to me. Clo. And then inueighes against Amyntas loue, Vantes his owne parts, and his great knowledges, And all so idle, as, in troth me thought I neuer heard a man (more vainely talke, For so much as I heard, for vp the hill I went with such a pace and neuer stayd To giue regard to any thing he sayd: As at the last I scarse had left him breath Sufficient to forsweare himselfe withall. Do. Ah what hath then my silly ignorance done To be deceiu'd, and mockt by such a one? Clo. And when I had recouered vp the hill, I fairely ran away and left my man In midd'st of his coniuring periuries; All empty to returne with mighty losse Of breath and labour, hauing cast away Much foolish paines in tricking vp himselfe For this exploit, and goes without his game, Which he in hope deuour'd before he came, I, I, too, mist my dressing by this meanes. But I admire how any woman can? Be so vnwise to like of such a man, For I protest I see nought else but froth, And shallow impudence, affected grace, And some few idle practise complement: And all the thing he is without he is, For affection striues but to appeare, And neuer is of Substance, or Sincere. And yet this dare of falshood hath beguil'd A thousand foolish vvenches in his dayes. Do. The more vvretch he, and more hard hap was theirs. Clo. Why do you sigh Dorinda are you toucht VVith any of these passages of mine? Do. No truly not of yours, but I haue cause In my particular that makes me sigh. Clo. Well vvell come one to put vs from this talke, Let vs deuise some sport to passe the time. Am. Faith I haue no great list to any sport. Do. Nor I in troth 'tis farthest from my minde. Clo. Then let vs tell old tales, repeate our dreames, Or any thing rather then thinke of loue. Am. And now you speake of dreames, in troth last night I vvas much troubled with a fearefull dreame. Do. And truely Amarillis so was I. Clo. And now I do remember too, I had A foolish idle dreame, and this it was: Me thought the fairest of Montanus lambs, And one he lou'd the best of all his flocke, VVas singled out, and chac'd b'a cruell curre, And in his hot pursuit makes towards me, (Me thought) for succour, and about me ran, As if it beg'd my ayde to haue his life, Which I long time deferr'd, and still lookt on, And would not rescue it, vntill at length I saw it euen quite wourried out of breath, And panting at my feete and could no more: And then me thought, I tooke it vp from death, And cherisht it with me, and brought it backe Home to Montanus, who vvas glad to see The poore recouer'd creature thus restor'd; And I my selfe was greatly pleas'd, me thought, That by my hand so good a deed vvas wrought, And Amarillis now tell vs your dreame? Am. Me thought as I in Eremathus walkt A fearefull vvoolfe rusht forth from out a brake, And towards me makes with open hideous aiwes. From whom I ranne with all the speed I could, T'escape my danger, and t'ouertake One vvhom I saw before, that might lend ayde To me distrest, but he me thought did runne As fast from me, as I did from the beast I cride to him (but all in vaine) to stay; The more I cride, the more he ranne away; And after I, and after me the woolfe, So long, as I began to faint in minde, Seeing my despaire before, my death behind: Yet ranne I still, and loe, me thought, at length A little he began to slacke his pace, Which I perceiuing, put to all my strength And ranne, as if desire had wing'd my heeles, And in the end me thought recouer'd him. But neuer woman felt more ioy it seem'd To ouertake a man, then did I him, By whom I scapte the danger I was in, That when I wak'd, as presently I awak'd, Toucht with that sudaine ioy, which my poore heart God knowes, had not beene vs'd vnto of late: I found my selfe all in a moyst faint sweate, VVhich that affrighting horrour did beget, And though I were deliu'red of my feare, And felt this ioy, yet did the trembling last Vpon my heart, when now the feare was past. Clo. This Amarillis may your good portend, That yet you shall haue comfort in the end. Am. God grant I may, it is the thing I want. Clo. And now Dorinda tell vs what you dream't, Do. I dream't, that hauing gone to gather flowers, And weary of my worke, reposing me Vpon a banke neere to a Riuers side, A subtile Serpent lurking in the grasse, Came secretly, and seiz'd on my breast, Which though I saw, I had no power to stirre, But lay me still, till he had eate away Into my bosome whence he tooke my heart, And in his mouth carrying the same away, Returnes me thought againe from whence he came, Which I perceiuing presently arose, And after it most wofully I went, To see if I could finde my heart againe, And vp and downe, I sought but all in vaine. Clo. In troth 'tis no good lucke to dreame of Snakes, One shall be sure t'heare anger after it. Do. And so it may be I haue done to day. Clo. Indeed, and I haue heard it neuer failes. SCEN. IIII. Techne. Cloris. Amarillis. Dorinda. Come you are talking here in iollity, Whilst I haue sought you Cloris all about: Come, come, good Cloris quickly come away. Clo. What is the newes? what haue we now to doo. Haue you another Caue to send me too? Tec. Ah talke no more of that but come away, As euer you will saue the wofull life Of a distressed man that dies for you. Clo. Why what doth Colax whom you sent to me Into the Caue, faint now vvith his repulse? Tec. I sent him not you would so wisely goe, In open sight, as men might see you goe, And trace you thither all the way you went. But come, ah t'is not he, it is the man You ought to saue: Amyntas is the man Your cruelty, and rigor hath vndone: O quickly come, or it vvill be too late; For 'twas his chance, and most vnluckely, To see both you and Colax, as you came Out of the Caue, and he thinkes verily You are possest by him; which so confounds His spirits, and sinkes his heart, that sure h'is runne T'vndoe himselfe, and O I feare 'tis done. Clo. If it be done my help will come too late, And I may stay, and saue that labour here. Am. Ah Cloris haste away if it be so, And doe not if thou hast a heart of flesh, And of a woman, stay and trifle time, Goe runne, and saue thine owne, for if he die, 'Tis thine that dies, his blood is shed for thee, And what a horror this will euer be Hereafter to thy guilty conscience, when Yeares shall haue taught thee wit, and thou shalt find This deed instampt in bloody Characters, Within the blacke records of thine owne thoughts. Which neuer will be raz'd whilst thou hast breath, Nor yet will be forgotten by the death. Besides wide Fame, will trumpet forth thy wrong, And thou shalt be with all posterity, Amongst th'examples held of cruelty, And haue this sauage deed of thine be made A sullen subiect for a Tragedy, Intitled Cloris, that thereby thy name May serue to be an euerlasting shame; And therefore go preuent so foule a staine. Do. Ah go, go Cloris, haste away with speede. Clo. Why whether should I go? I know not where To finde him now, and if he do this deed. It is his error, and no fault of mine. Yet pray thee Techne, which way went the man? Tec. Come Cloris, I will shew which way he went, In most strange fury, and most desperate speed. Still crying, Cloris, hast thou done this deed? Clo. Why had not you staid, and perswaded him? Tec. I could not stay him by no meanes I vs'd, Though all the meanes I could deuise I vs'd. Clo. VVell I will go, poore man to seeke him out, Though I can do him else no other good. I know indeed he hath deseru'd my loue, And if I would like any, should be him, So that I thought he would be true to me. But thus my dreame may chance now come to passe, And I may happen to bring home indeed Montanus sonne, Amyntas that deere Lambe He loues so well, and by my gracious deed, He may escape the danger he was in. VVhich if I do, and thereby do inthrall My selfe, to free and others misery, Then will I sit and sigh, and talke of loue As well as you, and haue your company. For something I do feele begin to moue, And yet I hope 'tis nothing else but feare; Yet what know I that feare may hap to loue. VVell Techne, come, I would not haue him yet To perish, poore Amyntas in this fit. Ama. VVell Cloris yet he may, for ought I see Before you come, vnlesse you make more hast. Ah cruell maide, she little knowes the griefe Of such a heart that's desperate of reliefe, Nor vnderstands she her owne happinesse, To haue so true a louer as he is. And yet I see sh'is toucht, if not too late, For I perceiue her colour come and goe, And though in pride she would haue hid her woe, Yet I saw sorrow looke out at her eyes. And poore Amyntas if thou now be gone, Thou hast (like to the Bee that stinging dies, And in anothers wound left his owne life) Transpierced by the death, that marble heart, Which liuing thou, couldst touch by no desert, And if thou shalt escape, thou hast suruiu'd Her cruelty, which now repents her wrong, And thou shalt by her fauours be reuiu'd. After the affliction thou hast suffred long, Which makes me thinke, that time, and patience may Intenerat at length the hardest heart, And that I may yet after all my woe, Liue t'ouertake Carinus mercy too. Do. And here this sad distresse of such a true, And constant louer ouercome with griefe. Presents vnto my guilty memory The wrongs Mirtillus hath indur'd of me. And O I would I knew now how he doth, I feare he is not vvell, I saw him not Scarse these three dayes, I meruaile vvhere he is And yet vvhat need I meruaile, vvho haue thus Chac'd him from me vvith frownes and vsage vile, And fondly left the substance of his faith, To catch the shadow of deceipt and guile? Was Colax he I thought the onely man, And is he now prou'd to be such a one? O that I euer lent an easie eare, Vnto so false a wretches flatteries, Whose very name I now abhorre to heare, And loath my selfe, for being so vnwise. What shall I doe sweet Amarillis now, Which way shall I betake me to recouer The losse of shame, and losse of such a louer? Am. Indeed Dorinda you haue done him wrong, But your repentance, and compassion now May make amends, and you must learne to do As I long time haue done, indure and hope, And on that turne of Fortunes Scene depend, VVhen all extremities must mend, or end. SCEN. V. MelibÃ¦us. Ergastus. VVell, come Ergastus, we haue seene ynow, And it is more then time, that we prepare Against this Hydra of confusion now Which still presents new hideous heads of feare: And euery houre we see begets new broyles, And intricates our youth in desperate toyles, And therefore let th'aduantage of this day, Which is the great and generall hunting day In Eremanthus, serue for this good deed: And when we meete (as all of vs shall meet Here in this place anone, as is decreed) We will aduise our Shepheards to intermit That worke, and fall to this imports vs more, To chase out these wilde mischiefes that do lurke, And worse infect, then th'Erimanthian Boare, Or all Beasts else, which onely spoile our fields, Whilst these which are of more prodigious kinds, Bend all their forces to destroy our mindes. Erg. And this occasion will be very fit Now to be tooke, for one day lost may lose More by example, then we shall reget In thousands, for when men shall once disclose The way of ill that lay vnknowne before, Scarce all our paines will euer stop it more. Man is a creature of a wilfull head, And hardly is driuen, but easily is lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCEN. I. Amarillis. Carinus. Ah gentle LÃ¦laps, pretty louing dogge, Where hast thou left thy maister, where is he, That great commander ouer thee and me? Thou wert not wont be farre off from his feete, And O no more would I, were he so pleas'd; But would as well as thou goe follow him, Through brakes and thickets, ouer cliffes and rocks So long as I had life to follow him, Would he but looke vpon me with that eye Of fauour, as h'is vs'd to looke on thee, Thou canst be clapt, and strookt with that faire hand That thrusts away my heart, and beates it backe From following him, which yet it euer will And though he flye me yet I must after still. But here he comes me thought he was not farre. Car: What meane you Amarillis in this sort By taking vp my dogge to marre my sport? Am. My deare Carinus thou doest much mistake I do not marre thy sport, tis thou marrst mine, And kilst my ioyes with that hard heart of thine. Thy dogge perhaps by some instinct doth know How that I am his maisters creature too, And kindely comes himselfe and fawnes on me To shew what you in nature ought to doe? Car. Fie Amarillis, you that know my minde Should not me thinkes thus euer trouble me. Am. What it is troublesome to be belou'd? How is it then Carinus to be loath'd? If I had done like Cloris, skornd your sute. And spurn'd your passions, in disdainefull sort, I had beene woo'd, and sought, and highly priz'd, But hauing n'other arte to winne thy loue, Saue by discouering mine, I am despis'd As if you would not haue the thing you sought, Vnlesse you knew, it were not to be got. And now because I lie here at thy feete, The humble booty of thy conquering eyes, And lay my heart all open in thy sight, And tell thee I am thine, and tell the right. And doe not sure my lookes, nor cloth my words In other colours, then my thoughts do vveare, But doe thee right in all, thou skornest me As if thou didst not loue sincerity Neuer did Crystall more apparantly Present the colour it contain'd with in Then haue these eyes, these teares, this tongue of mine Bewray'd my heart, and told how much I am thine. Car. Tis true I know you haue too much bewrayd And more then fits the honour of a mayd. Am. O if that nature hath not arm'd my breast With that stronge temper of resisting proofe, But that by treason of my weake complection, I Am made thus easie to the violent shot Of passion, and th'affection I should not: Me thinkes yet you out of your strength and power, Should not disdaine that weakenes, but should thinke It rather is your vertue, as indeed It is, that makes me thus against my kinde, T'vnlocke my thoughts, and to let out my minde, When I should rather die and burst with loue, Then once to let my tongue to say, I loue And if your worthy parts be of that power To vanquish nature, and I must be wonne Do not disdaine the worke vvhen you haue done, For in contemning me you do dispise That power of yours which makes me to be thus. Car. Now vvhat adoe is here with idle talke? And to no purpose, for you know I haue Ingag'd long since my heart, my loue and all To Cloris, vvho must haue the same and shall. Am. Why there is no such oddes twixt her and me I am a Nymph, tis knowne as well as she. There is no other difference betwixt vs twaine But that I loue, and she doth thee disdaine. No other reason can induce thy minde, But onely that which should diuert thy minde, I will attend thy flockes better then she, And dresse thy Bower more sweet, more daintily, And cheerish thee with Salets, and with Fruites, And all fresh dainties that the season sures; I haue more skill in hearbes, then she, by farre, I know which nourish, which restoring are: And I will finde Dictamnus for thy Goates, And seeke out Clauer for thy little Lambes, And Tetrisoll to cheerish vp their Dammes, And this I know, I haue a better voyce Then she, though she perhaps may haue more arte, But which is best; I haue the faithfull'st heart, Besides Amyntas hath her loue, I know, And she begins to manifest it now. Car. Amyntas haue her loue? that were most strange, When he hath gotten that you shall haue mine. Am. O deere Carinus, let me rest vpon That blessed word of thine, and I haue done. SCEN. II. Mirtillus. Carinus. Amarillis. VVell met Carinus, I can tell you newes, Your riuall, poore Amyntas, hath vndone And spoil'd himselfe, and lies in that weake case, As we thinke neuer more to see his face. Car. Mirtillus, I am sorry t'heare so much: Although Amyntas be competitor In th'Empire of her heart, vvherein my life Hath chiefest claime, I doe not wish his death: But by vvhat chance, Mirtillus pray thee tell? Mir. I will Carinus, though I grieue to tell. As Tytirus, Menalcas, and my selfe Were placing of our toyles (against anon That We shall hunt) below within the streight, Twixt Erimanthus, and Lycaus mount, We might perceeue vnder a ragged clife, In that most vncouch desart, all alone Distrest'd Amyntas lying on the ground, With his sad face, turn'd close vnto the rock, As if he loathed to see more of the world, Then that poore space, which was twixt him and it His right hand stretch a long vpon his side, His left he makes the pillar to support His carefull head, his Pipe he had hung vp Vpon a Beach tree by, vvhere he likewise Had plac'd his Sheep hooke, and his Knife, wherewith He had incaru'd an wofull Elegy, To shew th'occasion of his misery. His dogge Melampus sitting by his side, As if he were partaker of his vvoe: By vvhich we knew t'was he, and to him went, And after vve had call'd, and shooke him vp, And found him not to answere, nor to stirre And yet his eyes abroad, his body warme; We tooke him vp, and held him from the ground. But could not make him stand by any meanes; And sincking downe againe, we searcht to see If he had any vvound, or blow, or wrinch, But none could finde: at last by chance we spide A little horne which he had flung aside, Whereby we gest he had some poyson tooke. And thereupon vve sent out presently To fetch Vrania, vvhose great skill in hearbes Is such, as if there any meanes will be, As I feare none will be, her onely arte Must serue to bring him to himselfe againe. Car. Indeed Vrania hath bin knowne t'haue done Most desperate cures, and peraduenture may Restore him yet, and I doe wish she may. Mir. But hauing there vs'd all the helpe we could, And all in vaine, and standing by with griefe, (As we might well, to see so sad a sight) (And such an worthy Shepheard in that plight) We might perceiue come running downe the hill, Cloris and Techne, with what speed they could, But Cloris had got ground, and was before, And made more hast, as it concernd her more. And nearer as she came, she faster went, As if she did desire to haue beene there Before her feete, too slow for her swift feare. And comming to the place, she suddenly Stopt, starts, and shrikt, and hauing made such hast T'haue something done, now could she nothing do, Perhaps our presence might perplex her too, As being asham'd that any eye should see The new appearing of her naked heart, That neuer yet before was seene till now. Car. And 'tis ill hap for me it was seene now. Mir. For we perceiu'd how Loue and Modestie With seu'rall Ensignes, stroue within her cheekes Which should be Lord that day, and charged hard Vpon each other, with their fresh supplies Of different colours, that still came, and went, And much disturb'd her, but at length dissolu'd Into affection, downe she casts her selfe Vpon his senselesse body, where she saw The mercy she had brought was come too late: And to him calles O deare Amyntas, speake, Looke on me, sweete Amyntas, it is I That calles thee, I it is, that holds thee here, Within those armes thou haste esteem'd so deare. And though that loue were yet so young in her As that it knew not how to speake, or what, And that she neuer had that passion prou'd, Being first a louer ere she knew she lou'd, Yet what she could not vtter, she supplide, With her poore busie hands that rubb'd his face, Chafd his pale temples, wrung his fingers ends Held vp his head, and puld him by the hands, And neuer left her worke, nor euer ceast. Ama. Alas the least of this regard before, Might haue helpt all, then when 'twas in her power T'haue sau'd his heart, and to reuiue his minde, Now for all this, her mercy is vnkinde; The good that's out of season, is not good. There is no difference now twixt cruelty, And the compassion that's not vnderstood. Mir. But yet at length, as if those dainty hands, Had had a power to haue awakened death, We might perceiue him moue his heauy eyes, Which had stood fixt all the whole time before, And fastens them directly vpon her Which when she saw, it strook her with that force, As that it pierc'd through all the spirits she had, Made all the powers and parts of her shrinke vp, With that convulsion of remorse and griefe, As out she shrik'd, O deare, O my deare heart, Then shrikes againe, and then againe cryes out. For now that looke of his did shake her more, Then death or any thing had done before, That looke did read t'her new conceiuing heart, All the whole tragicke Lecture of his loue, And his sad suffrings, all his griefes, and feare, And now in th'end what he had done for her. And with that powerfull force of mouing too, As all the world of words could neuer doe. Ah what a silly messenger is Speech To be imploi'd in that great Embassie Of our affection in respect of th'eye? Ah 'tis the silent rhetoricke of a looke, That works the league betwixt the states of hearts, Not words I see, nor knowledge of the booke, Nor incantations made by hidden artes, For now this looke so melts her into teares, As that she powr'd them down like thunder drops, Or else did Nature taking pitty now Of her distresse, imploy them in that store, To serue as vailes, and to be interposde Betwixt her griefe and her, t'impeach her sight, From that full view of sorrow thus disclosde. And now with this came in Vrania there, With other vvomen, to imploy their best To saue his life, if b'any meanes they can. And so vve came our vvay, being sent for now About some conference for our hunting sports, And vvith vs Techne comes, vvho is supposde, T'haue beene a speciall cause of much of this. Car. Alas this sad report doth grieue me much, And I did neuer thinke, that Cloris had So dearely lou'd him as I finde she doth, For by this act of hers I plainly see, There will be neuer any hope for me. Ama. There may for me, if now Carinus thou VVilt stand but to thy vvord, as thou hast said. Mir. Ah would to God Dorinda had bene there, T'haue seene but Cloris act this vvofull part; It may be, it might haue deterr'd her heart From crueltie, so long as she had liu'd. Am. And I am glad Carinus hath but heard So much this day, for he may hap thereby To haue some feeling of my misery, But for Dorinda neuer doubt at all, She is more yours Mirtillus then you thinke. Mir. Ah Amarillis, I would that were true. But loe where come our chiefest heardsmen now, Of all Arcadia, we shall know more newes. SCEN. III. MelibÃ¦us, Ergastus, Montanus, Acrisius with other Arcadians, bringing with them Alcon, Lincus, Colax, Techne, PistophÅnax. You gentle Shepheards and Inhabitors Of these remote, and solitary parts Of Montaynous Arcadia, shut vp here Within these Rockes, these vnfrequented Clifts, The walles and bulwarkes of our libertie, From out the noyse of tumult, and the throng Of sweating toyle, ratling concurrencie, And haue continued still the same and one In all successions from antiquitie; Whil'st all the states on earth besides haue made A thousand reuolutions, and haue rowl'd From change to change, and neuer yet found rest, Nor euer bettered their estates by change. You, I inuoke this day in generall, To doe a worke that now concernes vs all: Lest that we leaue not to posteritie, Th'Arcadia that we found continued thus By our fore-fathers care who left it vs. For none of you I know, whose iudgement's graue Can ought discerne, but sees how much we are Transformd of late, and changd from what we were And vvhat distempers daily doe arise Amongst our people, neuer felt before, At vvhich I know you maruell, as indeed You well may maruel, whence they should proceed And so did good Ergastus here, and I, Vntill we set our selues more vvarily To search it out, vvhich by good hap vve haue, And found the authors of this vvickednesse. Which diuels attyr'd here in the shape of men, We haue produc'd before you, to the end You may take speedy order to suppresse Our growing follies, and their impiousnesse. Erg. Indeed these odious wretches which you see, Are they who haue brought in vpon our rest, These new and vnknowne mischiefes of debate, Of wanton pride, of scandulous report. Of vile deluding chaste and honest loues, Of vndeseru'd suspitious desperate griefes, And all the sadnesse we haue seene of late. And first this man, this Lincus here you see, Montanus you, and you Arysius know, With what deceit, and with what cunning arte, He entertaind your strifes abusd you both, By first perswading you that you had right In your demands, and then the right was yours, And would haue made as many rights, as men Had meanes, or power, or will to purchase them; Could he haue once attain'd to his desires. Mon. We doe confesse our errour, that we were Too easily perswaded by his craft, To wrangle for imagin'd titles, which We here renounce, and quit for euermore, Acry. And we desire the memory thereof May die with vs, that it be neuer knowne Our feeble age hath such example showne, Erg. And now this other strange impostor here, This Alcon, who like Lincus hath put on, The habite too of emptie grauitie, To catch opinion, and conceit withall, Seekes how to set vs all at variance here With nature, as this other with our selues, And would confound her, working with his arte, And labours how to make our mindes first sicke, Before our bodies, and perswade our health It is not well, that he may haue thereby Both it and sicknesse euer vnder cure. And forraine drugs brings to distemper's here And make vs like the wanton world abroad. Mel. But here are two the most pernitious spirits The world I thinke did euer yet produce. Colax and Techne, two such instruments Of Wantonnesse, of Lust and treachery, As are of power t'intice and to debaush The vniuersall state of honesty. Erg. But Techne who is that stands there by you. What is your company increast of late? Tec. Truely it is a very honest man A friend of mine that comes to see me here. Erg. He cannot then but be an honest man If he be one of your acquaintance sure. Mel. This man I found with them now since you went Maintaining hote dispute with Titerus About the rites and misteries of Pan. Erg. H'is like to be of their associats then. Erg. Techne, what is this secret friend of yours? Tec. For-sooth he is a very holy man. Erg. A very holy man? what is his name? Tec. Truely his name: Sir is PistophÅnax. Erg. What is he maskt, or is that face his owne? Tec. He is not maskt, tis his complexion sure. Erg. Techne we cannot credite thy report. Let one trie whether it be so or not, O see a most deformed ougly face, Wherewith if openly he should appeare, He would deterre all men from comming neere. And therefore hath that cunning wretch put on This pleasing visor of apparency, T'intice and to delude the world withall; So that you see with what strange inginiers, The proiect of our ruine is forecast. How they implanted haue their battery here, Against all the maine pillors of our state, Our Rites, our Custome, Nature, Honesty. T'imbroyle, and to confound vs vtterly, Reckning vs barbarous, but if thus their skill Doth ciuilize let vs be barbarous still. Mel. But now to shew the horrible effects Of Colax, and of Technes practises, (Besides this last exploit they vvrought vpon, Amyntas vvho, poore youth, lies now full weake: Vnder Vranias cure, vvhose skill we heare Hath yet recall'd him to himselfe againe) We haue sent out abroad into the vvoods, For Siluia and PalÃ¦mon two chast soules Whom they haue tortur'd so vvith iealousie, Of each the other, as they made them runne A part, to languish seuerally alone; And we haue sent for diuers others too, Whose hearts haue felt what impious craft can do. And here they come, and now you shall know all. SCEN. IV. PalÃ¦mon. Mirtillus. Carinus. Siluia. Dorinda. Amarillis. Daphne. Cloris. Amyntas. [Ergastus] Come good PalÃ¦mon, and good Siluia come, You haue indur'd too much, and to too long. Sil. Ah vvhy Ergastus doe you set our names So neere together, when our hearts so farre, Are distant from each other as they are? Indeed whilst vve were one as once vve were, And as we ought to be vvere faith obseru'd, PalÃ¦mon should not haue beene nam'd withou: A Siluia, nor yet Siluia vvithout him. But now vve may Ergastus, vve are too. Pal. Siluia, there in the greater wrong you doe. Sil. PalÃ¦mon, nay the greater vvrong you doe. Erg. Alas we know well where the wrong doth lie. Sil. I know you doe, and all the world may know. Pal. Siluia, you see your fault cannot be hid. Sil. It is no fault of mine PalÃ¦mon, that Your shame doth come to be reuealed here; I neuer told it, you your selfe haue not Conceal'd your worke so closely as you should. Pal. But there stands one can tell what you haue beene. Sil. Nay there he stands can tell what you haue beene. And sure is now in publicke here produc'd To testifie your shame, but not set on By me I doe protest, who rather would Haue di'd alone in secret with my griefe Then had your infamy discouered here. Wherein my shame must haue so great a share. Pal. I haue not sought to manifest your shame, Which Siluia, rather then haue done I would Haue beene content t'indure the worst of deaths, I hauing such an intrest in the same. Col. No Siluia, no PalÃ¦mon, I stand here Not t'accuse you, but t'accuse my selfe Of wrong, you both God knowes are cleare, I haue abus'd your apt credulitie, With false reports of things that neuer were: And therefore here craue pardon for the same. Pal. Why Colax, did not Siluia entertaine The loue of Thyrsis then as you told me? Col. PalÃ¦mon no, she neuer entertain'd His loue, nor wrong'd you as I euer knew. Sil. But Colax you saw how PalÃ¦mon did With Nisa falsifie his vow to me. Col. Siluia, by heauen and earth I sweare not I, But onely fain'd it out of subtiltie; For some vngodly ends I had decreed. Pal. O let not this be made some cunning baite To take my griefes with false beliefe, for I Had rather liue vvith sorrow then deceipt, And still t'be vndone, then to haue such reliefe. Sil. Ah let not this deuise be wrought to guilde My bitternesse, to make me swallow't now That I might be another time beguilde With confidence, and not trust vvhat I know. Pal. Ah Siluia now, how vvere I cleer'd of griefe, Had I the power to vnbeleeue beliefe. But ah my heart hath dwelt so long in house With that first tale, as this vvhich is come new, Cannot be put in trust with my desire So soone, besides 'tis too good to be true. Sil. Could I PalÃ¦mon but vnthinke the thought Of th'ill first heard, and that it vvere not so How blest were I? but loe I see how doubt Comes in farre easier then it can get out. And in these miseries of iealousie, Our eare haue greater credit then our eye. Mel. Stand not confus'd deare louers any more, For this is now the certaine truth you heare, And this vile vvretch hath done you both this vvrong. Pal. Ist possible, and is this true you say, And do I liue, and doe I see the day? Ah then come Siluia, for I finde this wound That pierc'd into the center of my heart, Hath let in loue farre deeper then it vvas. Sil. If this be so, vvhy then PalÃ¦mon know. I likewise feele the loue that vvas before Most in my heart, is now become farre more: And now O pardon me you worthy race O men, if I in passion vttred ought In preiudice of your most noble sexe; And thinke it vvas m'agrieued errour spake It knew not vvhat, transported so, not I. Pal. And pardon me you glorious company You starres of vvomen, if m'in raged heare Haue ought profan'd your reuerent dignity, And thou bright Pallas sou'raigne of all Nimphes, The royall Mistresse of our Pastorall Muse And thou Diana honour of the woods To whom I vow my songs, and vow my selfe, Forgiue me mine offence and be you pleas'd T'accept of my repentance now therefore, And grace me still, and I desire no more. Sil. And now I would that Cloris knew thus much That so she might be vndeceiued too, Whom I haue made beleeue so ill of men: But loe see where she comes, and as it seemes Brings her beliefe already in her hand Preuents my act, and is confirm'd before. Looke Cloris looke, my feares haue idle beene, PalÃ¦mon loues me there is trust in men. Clo. And Siluia I must not beleeue so too Or else God helpe I know not what to doe. Pal. Looke here Mirtillis looke what I told you Is now prou'd false, and women they are true. Mil. So I perceiue PalÃ¦mon, and it seemes But vaine conceipt that other wise esteemes. Mon. Alas here comes my deare restored sonne My louely child Amyntas here is come. Acry. And here is Cloris my deare daughter come And lookes as if she were affrighted still, Poore soule, with feare, and with her sudaine griefe, Clo. Loe here Montanus I haue brought you home Although with much a doe, your sonne againe And sorry am with all my heart that I, Haue beene the cause he hath indur'd so much. Mon. And I restore him backe againe to you Deare Cloris and doe vvish you to forget Your sorrowes past, and pray the gods you may From henceforth lead your life with happy ioy. Acry. Doe Cloris take him, and I wish as much. Erg. Well then to make our ioyfull festiuals The more complet, Dorinda, we intreate You also to accept Mirtillis loue, Who we are sure hath well deserued yours. Do. Although this be vpon short warning, yet For that I haue beene sommoned before By mine owne heart, and his deserts to me To yeeld to such a motion, I am now Content t'accept his loue, and wilbe his. Mir. Dorinda then I likewise haue my blisse And reckon all the sufferings I haue past Worthy of thee to haue this ioy at last. Mel. And you Carinus looke on that good Nymph Whose eye is still on you, as if she thought Her suffring too, deseru'd some time of ioy And now expects her turne, hath brought her lap For comfort too whil'st fortune deales good hap. And therefore let her haue it now poore soule For she is worthy to possesse your loue. Car. I know she is, and she shall haue my loue, Though Colax had perswaded me before Neuer t'accept or to beleeue the loue Of any Nymph, and oft to me hath sworne How he had tri'd them all, and that none were As men, beguild by shewes, suppos'd they were, But now I do perceiue his treachery, And that they haue both loue and constancy. Ama. O deare Carinus blest be this good houre, That I haue liu'd to ouertake at last That heart of thine which fled from me so fast. Erg. And Daphne too me thinkes your heauy lookes Shew how that something is amisse with you. Dap. Nothing amisse with me, but that of late I tooke a fall, which somewhat grieues me yet. Erg. That must aduise you Daphne from henceforth To looke more warily vnto your feele, Which if you do, no doubt but all this will be well. Mel. Then thus we see the sadnesse of this day Is ended with the euening of our ioy: And now you impious spirits, who thus haue rais'd The hideous tempests of these miseries, And thus abus'd our simple innocence, We charge you all here present t'auoyd, From out our confines, vnder paine to be Cast downe and dasht in pieces from these rockes, And t'haue your odious carkases deuour'd By beasts, being worse your selues then beasts to men. Col. Well then come Techne, for I see we two Must euen be forc'd to make a marriage too, And goe to Corinth, or some City neere, And by our practise get our liuing there: Which both together ioyn'd, perhaps we may: And this is now the worst of miseries Could come vnto me, and yet vvorthily, For hauing thus abus'd so many Nymphes, And vvrong'd the honour most vnreuerently Of vvomen, in that sort as I haue done, That now I am forst to vndergoe therefore, The vvorst of Plagues: to marry vvith a W. Alc. But Lincus, let not this discourage vs, That this poore people iealous of their rest, Exile vs thus, for vve no doubt shall finde Nations enough, that vvill most ready be To entertaine our skill, and cherish vs. And worthier people too, of subtler spirits, Then these vnfashion'd, and vncomb'd rude swaines, Lin. Yea and those Nations are farre sooner drawne T'all friuolous distractions then are these; For oft vve see, the grosse doe manage things, Farre better then the subtile, cunning brings Confusion sooner then doth ignorance. Alc. Yea and I doubt not whil'st there shall be found Fantasticke puling wenchnes in the world, But I shall florish, and liue iollily, For such as I by vvomen must begin To gaine a name and reputation winne, Which vvhen we haue attain'd to you know then How easily the vvomen draw on men. Lin. Nor doe I doubt but I shall likewise liue, And thriue, where euer I shall plant my selfe, For I haue all those helpes my skill requires A wrangling nature, a contesting grace, A clamorous voyce, and an audacions face. And I can cite the law t'oppugne the law, And make the glosse to ouerthrow the text I can alledge and vouch authority, T'imbroyle th'intent, and sense of equity, Besides by hauing beene a Notary, And vs'd to frame litigious instruments And leaue aduantages for subtilty, And strife to worke on, I can so deuise That there shall be no writing made so sure But it shall yeeld occasion to contest At any time when men shall thinke it best, Nor be thou checkt vvith this Pistophanax, That at thy first appearing thou art thus Discou'red here, thou shalt along with vs, And take thy fortune too, as vvell as we. Pist. Tush Lincus this cannot discourage me, For we that traffique with credulity And with opinion, still shall cherisht be: But here your errour was to enter first And be before me, for you should haue let Me made the way that I might haue mislikt That chaine of zeale that holds in amity, And call'd vp doubt in their establisht rites, Which would haue made you such an easie way, As that you might haue brought in what you would, Vpon their shaken and discattered mindes, For our profession any thing refutes, And all's vnsetled whereas faith disputes. Mel. Now what a muttring keepe you there, away Begone I say, and best doe, whilst you may. And since we haue redeem'd our selues so well Out of the bonds of mischiefe let vs all Exile with them their ill example too, Which neuer more remaines, as it begun, But is a wicked sire t'a farre worse sonne, And stayes not till it makes vs slaues vnto That vniuersall Tyrant of the earth Custome who takes from vs our priuiledge To be our selues, reades that great charter too Of nature and would likewise cancell man: And so in chaines our iudgements and discourse Vnto the present vsances, that we Must all our senses thereunto refer. Be as we finde our selues, not as we are, As if we had no other touch of truth And reason their the nations of the times, And place wherein we liue; and being our selues Corrupted, and abastardized thus Thinke all lookes ill, that doth not looke like vs And therefore let vs recollect our selues Dispers'd into these strange confused ill And be againe Arcadians as we were In manners and in habits as we were, And so solemnize this our day Of restauration, with other feasts of ioy.</field>
