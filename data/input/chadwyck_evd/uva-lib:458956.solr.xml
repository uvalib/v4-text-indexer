      <field name="fulltext">THE FAIRE MAIDE OF THE INNE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter CÃ¦sario, and Clarissa. Cesario. Interpret not Clarissa, my true zeale in giving you councell, to transcend the bounds That should confine a brother; tis your honour, And peace of mind (which honour last will leave you) I labour to preserve, and though you yet are Pure and untainted, and resolve to be so: Having a Fathers eye, and Mothers care In all your wayes to keep you faire, and upright. In which respects my best advices must Appeare superfluous; yet since love deere sister Will sometimes tender things unnecessary, Misconster not my purpose. Claris. Sir, I dare not: But still receive it as a large addition, To the much that I already stand ingagd for, Yet pardon me, though I professe upon A true examination of my selfe, Even to my private thoughts I cannot finde (Having such strong supporters to uphold me) On what slight ground the least doubt can be raisd To render me suspected I can fall, Or from my fame or vertue. CÃ¦sar. Far be it from me, To nourish such a thought; and yet excuse me, As you would doe a lapidary, whose whole fortunes Depend upon the safety of one Iewell If he think no case pretious enough To keep it in full lustre nor no locks, Though lending strength to Iron doores sufficient To gard it, and secure him; you to me are A Gemme of more esteeme, and prizd higher Then Vsurers doe their muck, or great men title. And any flaw (which heaven avert) in you, (Whose reputation like a Diamond Cut newly from the rock, women with envie, And men with covetous desires look up at) By prying eyes discovered, in a moment Would render what the braveries of Florence For want of counterpoize, forbeare to cheapen, Of little or no value. Claris. I see brother. The mark you shoot at, and much thank your love; But for my Virgin Iewell which is brought In comparison with your Diamond, rest assurd It shall not fall in such a workmans hands Whose Ignorance or Malice shall have power To cast one cloud upon it, but still keep Her native splendor. Cesario. Tis well, I commend you; And study your advancement with that care As I would doe a Sisters, whom I love With more then common order. Claris. That from me, I hope's returnd to you. Cesario. I doe confesse it, Yet let me tell you (but still with that love, I wish to increase between us) that you are Observd against the gravity long maintaind In Jtaly (where to see a mayd unmaskd Is held a blemish) to be over frequent In giving or receiving visits. Clari. How? Cesar. Whereas the custome is here to wooe by picture, And never see the substance: you are faire, And beauty drawes temptations on; You know it, I would not live to say a willing grant From you to one unworthy of your birth, Feature or fortune; yet there have been Ladies Of ranck, proportion, and of meanes beyond you, That have prov'd this no miracle. Claris. One unworthy? Why pray you gentle brother, who are they That I vouchsafe these bounties to? I hope In your strict Criticisme of me, and my manners, That you will not deny they are your equalls. Cesar. Angry? Claris, I have reason, but in cold bloud tell me, Had we not one Father? Cesar. Yes, and Mother to. Claris. And he a Souidier. Cesar. True; Claris. If I then borrow A little of the boldnesse of his temper, Imparting it to such as may deserve it; (How ere indulgent to your selves, you brothers Allow no part of freedome to your sisters) I hope 'twill not passe for a crime in me, To grant accesse and speech to noble suitors; And you escape for innocent, that descend To a thing so far beneath you. Are you touchd? Why did you think that you had Giges ring, Or the herbe that gives invisibility? Or that Bianchas name had ne'r bin mentiond; The faire mayd of the grand Osteria brother. CÃ¦sario. No more. Claris. A little brother. Your night walkes, And offerd presents; which coy she contemnd, Your combats in disguises with your rivalls, Brave Muletiers. Scullions perfum'd with grease, And such as cry meat for Cats must be rememberd; And all this pother for a common trull, A tempting signe, and curiously set forth, To draw in riotous guests, a thing exposd To every Ruffians rude assault; and subject For a poore salary, to a rich mans lust, Though made up of diseases. CÃ¦sar. Will you end yet? Claris. And this a Mistris for Albertus sonne, One that I should call sister? CÃ¦sar. Part not with Your modesty in this violent heate; the truth is, (For you shall be my Confessor) I love her, But vertuously; report that gives her out Only for faire, and adds not she is chast, Detracts much from her: for indeed she is, Though of a low condition; composd Of all those graces, dames of highest birth, Though rich in natures bounties, should be proud of; But leave her, and to you my neerest care, My dearest best Clarissa. Doe not think (For then you wrong me) I wish you should live A barren Virgin life; I rather ayme at A noble husband, that may make you mother Of many children, one that when I know him Worth your embraces, I may serve, and sue to: And therefore scorne not to acquaint me with That man, that happy man; you please to favour. Claris. I ever purposd it, for I will like With your allowance: Cesar. As a pawne of this; Receive this ring, but ere you part with it On any tearmes, be certaine of your choice; And make it knowne to me. Enter Servants with lights, Alberto, Baptista, Mariana, Mentivole. Claris. You have my hand for't; Cesar. Which were it not my sisters, I should kisse With too much heate. Claris. My Father, and his guests Sir. Alber. O my old friend, my tryde friend; my Baptista: These dayes of rest, and feasting, sute not with Our tougher natures, those were golden ones, Which were enjoyd at Sea; thats our true Mother: The Land's to us a stepdame; there we sought Honour, and wealth through dangers; yet those dangers Delighted more then their rewards, though great ones, And worth the undertakers: here we study The Kitchin arts, to sharpen appetite, Dulde with abundance, and dispute with Heaven; If that the least puffe of the rough Northwinde, Blast our times burthen, rendring to our Palats The charming juice lesse pleasing; whereas there If we had bisket, powderd flesh, fresh water: We thought them Persian delicates, and for musicke If a strong gale but made the maine yard cracke, We dancde to the lowd minstrell. Baptist. And feard lesse, (So far we were in love with noble action) A tempest then a calme. Alber. Tis true Baptista; There, there, from mutuall aydes lent to each other, And vertuous emulation to exceed In manly daring, the true schoole of friendship, We learnt those principles, which confirmd us friends Never to be forgot. Baptist. Never I hope. Albor. We were married there, for bells the roring Cannon, A loud proclaimd it lawfull, and a prize Then newly tane and equally divided, Servd as a dowry to you, then stild my wife; And did enable me to be a husband, Fit to encounter so much wealth though got With bloud and horror. Maria. If so got, tis fit Sir Now you possesse it, that you should enjoy it In peace, and quiet; I, your sonne, and daughter That reape the harvest of your winters labour, Though debtors for it yet have often trembled, When in way of discourse, you have related How you came by it. Alber. Trembled? how the softnesse Of your sex may excuse you, Ile not argue, But to the world, how ere I hold thee noble I should proclaime this boy some cowards bastard, And not the Image of Albertus youth: If when some wishd occasion calls him forth, To a brave tryall, one weake artery Of his should show a feaver, though grim death Put on a thousand dreadfull shapes to fright him; The Elements, the sea and all the windes We number on our compasse, then conspiring To make the ScÃ¦n more ghastly; I must have thee Sirra, I must. If once you graple with An enemies ship, to boord her, though you see The desperat Gunner ready to give fire, And blow the deck up, or like Cesars Souldiour Thy hands like his cut off, hang by the teeth, And die undanted. Maria. I even dye to heare you: My sonne, my lov'd Cesario runne such hazards? Blesd Saints forbid it: you have done enough Already for one family, that rude way; Ile keep him safe at home, and traine him up A compleat Courtier: may I live to see him, By sweet discourse, and gracious demeanor, Winne, and bring home a faire wise, and a rich; Tis all I rest ambitious of. Alber. A Wife! As if there were a course to purchase one Prevailing more then honourable action? Or any Intercessors move so farre, To take a Mistris of a noble spirit, As the true fame of glorious victories, Achievd by sweat and bloud! Ã´ the brave dames Of warlike Genoa! they had eyes to see The inward man, and only from his worth, Courage, and conquests: the blind Archer knew To head his shafts, or light his quenched torch, They were proofe against them else. No Carpet Knight That spent his youth in groves, or pleasant bowers; Or stretching on a Couch his lazy limbes, Sung to his Lute such soft and melting notes, As Ovid, nor Anacreon ever knew, Could work on them, nor once bewitch their sense; Though he came so perfumd as he had robd SabÃ¦a, or Arabia, of their wealth; And stord it in one sute: I still remember, And still remember it with joy Baptista, When from the resceu of the Genoa fleete, Almost surprizd by the Venetian Gallies, Thou didst returne, and wert receivd in triumph. How lovely in thy honord wounds and scars Thou didst appeare? what worlds of amorous glances The beauties of the City (where they stood, Fix'd like so many of the fairest starrs) Shot from their windowes at thee? how it firde Their blouds to see the Enemies captive streames Borne through the streets? nor could chast Juliana The Dukes faire Neece, though garded with their greatnesse Resist this gallant charge, but laying by Disparity of fortune from the object, Yeelded her selfe thy prisoner. Bap. Pray you chuse some other theame. Mari. Can there be one more pleasing? Bap. That triumph drew on me a greater torture, And tis in the remembrance little lesse Then ever Captive sufferd. Mari. How? to gaine the favour of so great a Lady? Bap. Yes, since it prov'd fatall, t'have bin happy Madam Adds to calamity, and the heavie losse Of her I durst not hope for once injoyd, Turnes what you thinke a blessing to a curse, Which griefe would have forgotten. Alber. I am sorry I touchd upon it. Maria. I burne rather Sir, With a desire to heare the story of your loves, and shall receave it as a favour, Which you may grant. Bap. You must not be denyde, Yet with all brevity I must report it; Tis true faire Iuliana (Genoas pride) Enamord of my actions, likd my person; Nor could I but with joy meet her affection; Since it was lawfull, for my first wife dead; We were closly married, and for some few months Tasted the fruits of't; but malitious fate, Envying our too much happinesse, wrought upon A faithlesse servant, privie to our plot, And Cabinet Councellor to Juliana, Who either for hope or reward, or feare, Discoverd us to the incensed Duke: Whose rage made her close prisoner, and pronouncd On me perpetuall banishment: some three yeares I wanderd on the Seas, since entertaind By the great Duke of Florence; but what fate Attended her? or Prospero my friend, That stayd at Genoa, to expect the issue, Is yet uncertaine. Enter a Gentleman. Alber. From the Duke: Bap. Hee's welcome, to end my forc'd relation. Alber. Signior Baptista; The great Dukes will commands your present eare. Gent. It points indeed at both of you; Bap. I waie it. Alber. In Mariana, to your rest. Bap. Nay leave us, we must be private. Maria. Stay not long CÃ¦sario: âExeunt. Manet CÃ¦sario, Mentivole. Mentivo. So these old men vanishd tis allowd, That we may speake, and how so ere they take Delight in the discourse of former dangers, It cannot hinder us to treate a little Of present pleasures. CÃ¦sario. Which if well injoyd, Will not alone continue, but increase In us their friendship. Ment. How shall we spend the night? To snore it out like drunken Dutchmen, would Sort ill with us Italians. We are made Of other metall, fiery, quick, and active; Shall we take our fortune? and while our cold fathers (In whom long since our youthfull heates were dead,) Talke much of Mars, serve under Venus Ensignes, And seeke a Mistris? CÃ¦sar. Thats a game deere friend, That does admit no rivald in chase of it, And either to be undertooke alone, Or not to be attempted. Ment. I'le not presse you: What other sports to entertaine the time with The following morning? CÃ¦sar. Any that may become us. Menti. Is the Neapolitan horse the Vireroy sent you, In a fit plight to runne? CÃ¦sar. So my Groom tells me, I can boast little of my horsmanship; Yet upon his assurance, I dare wager A thousand Crowns, 'gainst any horse in Florence, For an eight myle course. Menti. I would not win of you, In respect you are impatient of losse: Else I durst match him with my Barbary For twice the summe. CÃ¦sar. You doe well to excuse it, being certain to be beaten. Menti. Tush. You know the contrary. Cesar. To end the controversie. Put it to tryall, by my life ile meete you Enter Clarissa. With the next rising sunne. Menti. A match. But here Appeares a Cynthian, that scornes to borrow A beame of light from the great eye of Heaven: She being her selfe all brightnesse; how I envie Those amorous smiles, those kisses, but sure chast ones Which she vouchsafes her brother? Claris. You are wanton: Pray you think me not Biancha, leave I pray you; My Mother will not sleep before she see you, And since you know her tendernesse, nay fondnesse; In every circumstance that concernes your safety, You are not equall to her. Cesar. I must leave you, but will not faile to meet you. Menti. Soft sleepes to you. Within Mariana: Cesario. Claris. You are calld againe. Cesar. Some sonnes Complaine of too much rigor in their Mothers; I of too much indulgence; you will follow.â Exit. Claris. You are her first care, therefore leade the way. Ment. She staies: blest opportunity, she staies? As she invited conference, she was ever Noble, and free; but thus to tempt my frailty, Argues a yeelding in her; or contempt Of all that I dare offer; stand I now Consulting? No, ile put it home. Claris. Who waites there? more lights. Menti. You need them not, they are as uselsse, As at noone-day; can there be darknesse, where Nature then wisely liberall, vouchsafd To lend two Sunnes. Claris. Hyperboles: Menti. No, truths. Truths beauteous virgin, so my lovesicke heart Assures me, and my understanding tels me I must approach them wisely, should I rashly Presse neare their scortching beams, they would consume me And on the contrary should your disdaine Keepe me at too much distance, and I want Their comfortable heate, the frost of death Would seise on all my faculties. Cla. Pray you pause sir. This vehemency of discourse must else needs tire you. These gay words take not me, tis simple faith Honest jntegrity, and lawfull flames I am delighted with: Ment. Such I bring with me, and therefore Lady, Cla. But that you tooke me off Ere I came to a period. I had added A long experience must bee requird Both of his faith and trust with whom a virgin Trafficks for whats dearest in this life, Her libertie, and honor; I confesse I oft have viewd you with an eye of favour, And with your generous parts the many tenders Of doing me all faire offices, have woone A good opinion from me. Ment. Oh speake ever, I never heard such musick; ClÃ¦, a Playne tuno sir: But tis a hearty one; when I perceive By evident proofes, your aimes are truly noble, And that you bring the Engines of faire love, Not of foule lust, to shake and undermine My maiden fortresse: I may then make good What now I dare not promise. Ment. You already In taking notice of my poore deservings, Have beene magnificent, and twill appeare A frontlesse Impudence to aske beyond this, Yet qualifie, though not excuse my error, Though now I am ambitious to desire A confirmation of it. Cla. So it wrong not my modesty to grant it, Ment. Tis far from me, I only am a sutor, you would grace me With some toy, but made rich in that you wore it, To warrant to the world that I usurp not When I presume to stile my selfe your servant, A riband from your shooe, Cla. You are too humble, Ile think upon't; and something of more value Shall witnesse how I prize you, it growes late, Ile bring you to the doore, Ment. You still more binde me, âExeunt Ent. Duke of Florence, Alberto: Baptista: Magistrates, And Attendants. Duke. You finde by this assur'd jntelligence The preparation of the Turke against us. We have met him oft and beate him; now to feare him Would argue want of courage, and I hold it A safer policie for us and our signories To charge him in his passage ore the sea' Then to expect him here. Alb. May it please your highnesse Since you vouchsafe to thinke me worthy of This great imployment, if I may deliver My judgment freely, tis not flattery Though I say my opinion waits on you, Nor would I give my suffrage and consent To what you have propos'd, but that I know it Worth the great speaker, though that the deniall Cald on your heavie anger. For my selfe I do professe thus much, if a blunt Soldier, May borrow so much from the old tongu'd Courtier, (That ecchoes what so ere the Prince allowes of) All that my long experience hath taught me That have spent three parts of my life at sea, (Let it not tast of arrogance that I say it) Could not have added reasons of more waite To fortifie your affections, then such As your grace out of observation meerly Already have propounded. Bap. With the honor to give the daring enemy an affront In being the first opposer it will teach Your Soldiers boldnesse: and strike feare in them That durst attempt you. 1. Magi. Victualls and ammunition, And mony too the sinewes of the war, are stor'd up in the Magazine. 2. Magi. And the gallies new rigd and traind up. And at two dayes warning fit for the service. Duke. We commend your care, Nor will we ere be wanting in Our counsailes, As we doubt not your action; you Baptista Shall stay with us; that Merchant is not wise That ventures his whole fortunes in one bottome. Albert. Be our Admirall, spare your thankes, His merit in you that jnvites this honor, Preserve it such; ere long you shall heare more, Things rashly undertaken end as ill, But great acts thrive when reason guides the will. âExeunt Enter 3.

And when they, have cut one anothers throats Enter Mentivole, and Cesario. Make in to part em. 2. There is no such hazard, Their fathers freindship, and their love forbid it; See where they come! 1. With fury in their loookes. Ment. You have the wages, with what fowle play got Ile not dispute: CÃ¦sar. Fowle play, Ment. I cannot speak it In a fairer language, and if some respects Familiar to my selfe chaind not my tongue, I should say no more. I should, but Ile sit down, With this disgrace; how ere presse me no farther. For if once more provokd, youl understand I dare no more suffer an Injury Then I dare doe one, CÃ¦sar. Why sir are you injur'd In that I take my right which I would force, Should you detaine it? Ment. Put it to judgement. CÃ¦sar. No my will in this shall carrie it, Ment.

And speedily I beseech you; my rage over That pourd upon my reason clouds of error, I see my folly, and at what deare losse I have exchangd a reall innocence To gaine a meere fantasticall report, Transported only by vaine popular wind, To bee a daring nay foole hardie man. Ent. Baptista. But could I satisfie my selfe within here, How should I beare my fathers frowne? They meet me, My guilt conjures him hither. Bap. Sirra: Mentiv. Sir: Bap. I have met the trophies of your ruffian sword: Was there no other Anvile to make triall How far thou durst be wicked, but the bosome Of him which under the adulterate name Of friendship thou hast murder? Ment. Murderd sir? My dreams abhor so base a fact; true valor Imployd to keepe my reputation faire from the austerest judge, can never merit To be branded with that title; you begot me A man, no coward; and but call your youth To memory, when injur'd you could never Boast of the Asses fortitude, slave like patience: And you might justly doubt I were your sonne, If I should entertaine it; if CÃ¦sario Recover, as I hope his wound's not mortall, A second tryall of what I dare doe In a just cause, shall give strong witnesse for me I am the true heire to Baptistas courage As to his other fortunes. Baptist. Boy, to neither: But on this strict condition, which jntreaties From Saints, nay Angels, shall not make me alter. A friendship so began, and so continu'd Betweene me and Alberto my best friend, Your brawles shall not dissolve; it is my will And as I am thy father, I command thee, That jnstantly on any tearms how poore So ere it skils not, thou desire his pardon And bring assurance to me has sign'd it, Or by my fathers soule ile never know thee: But as a stranger to my blood; performe it, And suddainly without reply, I have said it. Ment. And in it given a heavier sentence on me Then the most cruell death; you are my father And your will to be servd, and not disputed By me that am your sonne: but ile obey, And though my heart strings crack for't, make it known, When you command, my faculties are your own.

O but from a friend, To receive this blody measure from a friend! If that a man should meete a violent death In a place where he had taken sanctuary, Would it not grieve him? such all Florence held Their friendship, and tis that which multiplyes The injury. Physi. Have patience worthy Signior. Alber. I doe protest as I am man and soldier, If I had buried him in a wave at sea, (Lost in some honorable action) I would not to the saltnesse of his grave Have added the least teare; but these quarrels Enter Mariana, and Clarissa. Bred out of game and wine, I had as lief He should have died of a surfeit. Maria. Oh what comfort? How is it with our son Sir? Alber. His Work-masters Beare in my hand here as my Lawyer does, When I have a crackt title, or bad sute in Law, All shall goe well. Maria. I pray you Gentl. what think you of his wound Physi. Tis but a scratch, nothing to danger. Claris. But he receiv'd it from a friend, And the unkindnesse tane at that, may kill him. Mari. Let me see him: Physi. By no meanes, he slumbers. Mari. Then I cannot beleive you, When you tell me ther'es hope of him. Alber. Yet many Ladyes Doe give him more faith to their Physition Then to their Confessor. Claris. O my poore lost brother, And friend more deere then brother. Alber. More loud instruments To disturbe his slumbers! goe, goe, take Caroch: And as you love me, you and the Girle retire To our Summer house, 'ith Country; ile be with you Within these two dayes. Maria.

Shall showre upon you. Of all men breathing, Wherefore doe you arrive here? are you mad? My injury begins to bleed a fresh At sight of you; why this affront of your I receive more malitious then the other. Your hurt was only danger to my sonne: But your sight to mee is death; why come you hither? Do you come to view the wounds, wc h you have made? And glory in them? Menti. Rather worthy Sir, to powre oyle into them. Alber. I am a Souldier Sir, Least part of Courtier, and understand By your smooth oyle Your present flattery. Menti. Sir, for my Fathers sake acknowledge me To be borne a Gentleman, no slave; I ever Held flatterers of that breed; do not misconstrue In your distaste of me, the true intent Of my comming hither, for I doe protest I doe not come to tell you I am sorry For your sonnes hurt. Alber. Not sorry? Menti. No not sorry; I have to the lowest ebbe, lost all my fury: But I must not lose my honesty; twas he Gave heate unto the injury, which returnd (Like a Petar ill lighted into 'th bosome Of him gave fire to't) yet I hope his hurt, Is not so dangerous, but he may recover; When if it please him, call me to account, For the losse of so much bloud, I shall be ready To doe him noble reason. Alber. You are arm'd me thinks with wondrous confidence. Menti. O with the best Sir; For I bring penitence, and satisfaction. Alber. Satisfaction? Why I heard you say but now, You were not sorry for his wounds. Menti. Nor am I: the satisfaction which I bring Sir, is to you; You are a Gentleman ne'r injurd me; One ever lov'd my Father, the right way, And most approv'd of noble amity. Yet I have runne my sword quite through your heart. And slightly hurt your sonne; for't may be feard, A griefe tane at these yeares for your sonnes losse, May hazard yours: And therefore I am sent By him that has most interest in your sorrow; Who having chid me almost to the ruin Of a disheritance, for violating So continued and so sacred a friendship Of 50. winters standing: such a friendship, That ever did continue like the spring; Ne'r saw the fall o'th leafe; by him I am sent To say the wrong I have done Sir, is to you: And that I have quite lost him for a Father, Vntill I finde your pardon; nay there followes A waightier deprivation; his estate I could with a lesse number of sighes part with. Fortune might attend my youth, and my deservings In any Climate: but a Fathers blessing, To settle and confirme that fortune, no where; But only here. Your pardon, give me that; And when you have done, kill me; for tis that Takes from me the effect of excommunication; A Fathers heavie curse. Alber. Nay, may that curse Light on himselfe, for sending thee in this minute: When I am grown as deafe to all compassion, As the cruellest Sea fight, or most horrid tempest. That I had drownd i'th Sea a thousand duckets, Thou hadst not made this visit: rash young man, Thou tak'st me in an ill Planet, and hast cause To curse thy Father; for I doe protest, If I had met thee in any part o'th world, But under my own roofe, I would have killd thee. Within there.âEnter Physitian, Chirurgion, and Servants. Looke you! Here's a triumph sent for the death of your young Master. Serv. Shall we kill him? Alber. No, Ile not be so unhospitable; but Sir, By my life, I vow to take assurance from you, That right hand never more shall strike my sonne. Menti. That will be easily protested. Alber. Not easily, when it must be exacted, and a bloudy seale to't. Bind him, and cut off's right hand presently: Faire words shall never satisfie foule deeds. Chop's hand off. Menti. You cannot be so unrighteous, to your own honour. Phy. O sir, collect your selfe; And recall your bloudy purpose. Alber. My intents of this nature, do ever come to action Chirur. Then I must fetch another stickler.â Exit. Alber. Yet I doe grieve at heart; And I doe curse thy Father heartily, That's the cause of my dishonour; sending thee In such an houre, when I am apt for mischiefe: Apt as a Dutch man after a Sea-fight, When his Enemy kneeles afore him; come dispatch. Phys. Intreate him Noble Sir; Menti. You shall excuse me; Whatsoever he dares doe, that I dare suffer. Enter Cesario, and Chirurgion. Cesar. Oh sir, for honours sake stay your foule purpose, For if you do proceed thus cruelly, There is no question in the wound you give him, I shall bleed to death for't. Alber. Thou art not of my temper, What I purpose, cannot be alterd. Serv. Sir; the Duke With all speed expects you. You must instantly Ship all your followers, and to sea. Alber. My blessing stay with thee upon this condition, Take away his use of fighting; as thou hop'st To be accounted for my son, perform't.â Exit. Cesar. You heare what I am injoynd too. Menti. Pray thee take it, Only this ring, this best esteemed Iewell: I will not give't to'th hangman chops it off; It is to deare a relique. Ile remove it nearer my heart. Cesar. Ha, that ring's my sisters. The ring I injoynd her never part withall Without my knowledge; come sir, we are friends: Pardon my fathers heate, and melancholy; Two violent Feavers which he caught at Sea, And cannot yet shake off: only one promise I must injoyne you to, and seriously. Hereafter you shall never draw a sword To the prejudice of my life. Menti. By my best hopes I shall not. Cesar. I pray deliver me your sword On that condition. Menti. I shall Sir, may it hereafter Ever fight on your part. Cesar. Noble Sir, I thank you; But for performance of your vow, I intreat Some gage from you. Menti. Any Sir. Cesar. Deliver me that ring. Menti. Ha, this ring? indeed this Iewell bindes me, If you knew the vertue of it, never more To draw my sword against you. Cesar. Therefore I will have it. Menti. You may not. Cesar. Come: you must. I that by violence could take your hand, Can inforce this from you; this is a token Sir, That we may prove friends hereafter. Fare you well. Phys. Why did you ceise his sword Sir? Cesar. To perform what my Father bade me, I have for the present tane away his Vse of fighting. Phys. Better so, Then take that which your Father meant. Exeunt. Manet Montivole. Menti. Was ever the like usage? Ã´ that ring! Dearer then life, whether is honour fled Cesario? Thou art unmanly in each part, To seize my sword first and then split my heart. Exit. Enter Host, and Clowne. Host. Thy Master that lodges here in my Hosteria, Is a rare man of art, they say hee's a Witch. Clow. A witch? Nay hee's one step of the Ladder to preferment higher, he is a Conjurer? Host. Is that his higher title. Clow. Yes, I assure you, for a Conjurer is the Devills Master, and commands him; whereas a witch is the Devills Prentice and obeys him. Host. Bound Prentice to the Devill! Clow. Bound and inrolld I assure you, he cannot start; and therefore I would never wish any Gentleman to turne Witch. Host: Why man. Clow: Oh he looses his gentility by it, the Devill in this case cannot helpe him, he must go to the Herald for new armes beleeve it. Host. As I am true Inkeper, yet a Gentleman borne, Ile ne'r turne witch for that trick, And thou hast bin a great Traveller. Clow. No indeed, not I Sir; Host. Come you are modest. Clow. No I am not modest, for I told you a lye, that you might the better understand I have bin a traveller. Host. So sir, they say your Master is a great Physitian too Clow. He was no foole told you that, I assure you. Host. And you have beene in England, but they say Ladies in England take a great deale of Physick. Clow. Both wayes on my reputation. Host. So tis to be understood: But they say Ladyes there take Physick for fashion. Clow. Yes sir, and many times dye to keep fashion. Host. How? dye to keep fashion! Clow. Yes, I have knowne a Lady sicke of the small Pockets, onely to keepe her face from Pitholes, take cold, strike them in againe, kick up the heeles and vanish. Host. There was kicking up the heeles with a witnesse. Clow. No Sir; I confesse a good face has many times bin the motive to the kicking up of the heeles with a witnesse: but this was not. Enter Hostesse, and Bianca. Host. Here comes my wife and daughter. Clow. You have a prety commodity of this night worm? Host. Why man? Clow. She is a pretty lure to draw custome to your ordinary. Host. Dost think I keep her to that purpose? Clow. When a Dove-house is empty, there is cuminseed used to purloine from the rest of the neighbours; In England you have severall Adamants, to draw in spurres and rapiers; one keeps silk-worms in a Gallery: A Milliner has choice of Monkies, and Paraketoes; another shewes bawdy East Indian Pictures, worse than ever were Aretines, a Goldsmith keeps his wife wedged into his shop like a Mermaide, nothing of her to bee seene (thats woman) but her upper part. Host. Nothing but her upper part? Clow. Nothing but her upper bodies, and he lives at the more hearts ease. Host. Whats the reason? Clow. Because her neather part can give no temptation; by your leave sir, ile tend my Master, and instantly bee with you for a cup of Cherelly this hot weather. Host. A nimble pated rascall, come hither daughter, when was Cesario here? Bian. Sir not this fortnight. Host. I doe not like his visits, commonly He comes by Owle-light, both the time and manner Is suspitious; I doe not like it. Bian. Sir, the Gentleman Is every way so noble, that you need not Question his intent of comming, though you did; Pray Sir preserve that good opinion of me, That though the custome of the place I was borne in Makes me familiar to every guest, I shall in all things keep my selfe a stranger To the vices they bring with them. Hostis. Right my daughter? She has the right straine of her mother. Host. Of her mother? And I would speake, I know from whence she took it; When I was as young I was as honest. Hostis. Leave your prating, And study to be drunk; and abuse your guests over, and over, Enter Forobosco, and Clowne. Host. Peace wife. My honourable guest, Foro. My indeard Landlord? And the rest o'th complements o'th house. Host. Breakfast is ready Sir; It waites only the tide of your stomack. Clow. And mine gapes for't like a stale Oyster. Ere you goe to bed, faile not of that I pray. âExeunt all but Forobosco, and Clowne. Foro. We will instantly be with you; Now we are all fellowes. Nine a clock, and no clyents come Yet, sure thou dost not set up bills enough. Clow. I have set up bills in abundance. Foro. What bills? Clow. Marry for curing of all diseases, Recovery of stolne goods, And a thousand such impossibilities. Foro. The place is unlucky, Clow. No certaine, tis scarcity of mony; doe not you here the Lawyers complain of it? men have as much malice as ever they had to wrangle, but they have no mony: whether should this mony be tralaunct? Foro. To the Devill I think. Clow. Tis with his cofferer I am certaine, that's the Vsurer. Foro. Our cheating does not prosper so well as it was wont to doe. Clow. No sure, why in England we coo'd cozen 'em as familiarly, as if we had travaild with a Briefe, or a Lotterie. Foro. I'th Low-countries we did prety well. Clow. So so, as long as we kept the Mop-headed butter-boxes sober; marry when they were drunke, then they grew buzards: You should have them reel their heads together, and deliberate; your Dutchman indeed when he is foxt, is like a Fox; for when hee's sunke in drink, quite earth to a mans thinking, tis full Exchange time with him, then hee's subtlest; but your Switzert, was nothing to cheate him. Foro. Nothing? Clow. No nor conscience to bee made of it; for since nature afort-hand cozend him of his wit, twas the lesse sinne for us to cozen him of his mony. Foro. But these Italians are more nimble-pated, wee must have some new trick for them, I protest but that our Hostisse daughter is a sweet lasse, and drawes great resort to'th house, we were as good draw teeth a horseback. Clow. I told 'em in the Market place you could conjure, and no body would beleeve me: but ere long I will make'em beleeve you can conjure with such a figuary. Foro. What language shal's conjure in? high Dutch I thinke, that's full i'th mouth. Clow. No, no, Spanish, that roares best; and will appeare more dreadfull. Foro. Prethee tell me thy conceit thou hast to gull them. Clow. No, no, I will not steale it; but my dear Iewstrump, for thou art but my instrument, I am the plotter, and when we have cozen'd 'em most titely, thou shalt steale away the Inn-keepers daughter, I'le provide my selfe of another moveable: and wee will most purely retire our selues to Geneva. Foro. Thou art the compasse I saile by. Enter Baptista and Mentivole. Ment. Was ever expectation of so Noble A requitall answered with such contumely! A wild Numidian that had suck't a Tigresse, Would not have bin so barbarous; did he threat To cut thy hand off? Ment. Yes Sir, and his slaves were ready to perform't. Bapt. What hindred it? Ment. Onely his sonnes intreaty. Bapt. Noble youth, I wish thou wert not of his blood; thy pitty Gives me a hope thou art not. Ment. You mistake Sir, The injury that followed from the sonne, Was worse then the fathers; he did first disarme and tooke from me a Iewell which I prize above my hand or life. Bap. Take thy sword from thee? He stole it like a thiefe rather, he could not I'th field deprive thee of it. Ment. He tooke it from me, And sent me forth so thinne, and so unmade up, As if I had bin a Foote-boy. Bap. O my fury! I must now aske thee forgivenesse, that my rashnesse Bred out of too much friendship, did expose thee To so eminent a danger; which I vowe I will revenge on the whole Family: All the calamities of my whole life, My banishment from Genoa, my wifes losse Compar'd to this indignity is nothing; Their Family shall repair't; it shall be to them Like a plague, when the Dog-star reignes most hot: An Italians revenge may pause, but's ne're forgot. Exit. Ment. I would I had conceal'd this from my father, For my interest in Clarissa; my care now Must be to untangle this division, That our most equall flames may be united; And from these various and perturbed streames Rise like a sweet morne after terrible dreames.â Exit Enter Clarissa and CÃ¦sario. CÃ¦sar. I am happy in your recovery, And I Sister, am ever best pleased in your happinesse: But I wish a toy should be on your finger. Clar. My Ring this morning when I wash't I put it off, ti's in my windowe. CÃ¦s. Wher's your Looking-glasse? Clar. Here Sir. CÃ¦s. T'is a faire one. Clar. T'is pure Chrystall. CÃ¦s. Can a Diamond cut in Crystall? let me see, I'le grave my name in't. Clar. Oh, you'l spoyl my glasse. Would you not have your brother in your eye? CÃ¦s. I had thougt he had bin Planted in your heart, Looke you, the Diamond cuts quaintly, you are cozen'd, Your Crystall is too britle. Clar. T'is the Ring I gave unto Mentivole, sure the same. You put me to amazement Sir, and horror; How came you by that ring? CÃ¦s. Does the blood rise? Clar. Pray Sir resolve me, Ã´ for pitty doe; And take from me a trembling at the heart, That else will kill me: for I too much feare Nothing but Death could ravish ir from his hand That wore it. CÃ¦sar. Was it given to Mentivola on that condition? Clar. Tell me of his health first. And then I'le tell you any thing. Cesar. By my life he's well, In better health then I am. Clar. Then it was Sir. CÃ¦sar. Then shall I ever hate thee, oh thou false one; Hast thou a Faith to give unto a friend, And breake it to a brother? did I not By all the tyes of blood importune thee Never to part with it without my knowledge? Thou might'st have given it to a Muliter, And made a contract with him in a stable At as cheap a price of my vengeance: never more Shall a Womans trust beguile me; You are all Like Reliques: you may well be look't upon, But come a man to'th handling of you once, You fall in peeces. Clar. Dear Sir, I have no way Look't either beneath reason or my selfe In my election; there's parity in our blood, And in our fortunes, ancient amity Betwixt our parents: to which wants nothing, But the fruit of blest marriage between us, To add to their posterities: nor does now Any impeachment rise, except the sad And unexpected quarrell which divided So noble and so excellent a friendship, Which as I ner'e had Magick to foresee So I could not prevent. CÃ¦sar. Well you must give me leave To have a hand in your disposing, I shall In the absence of my father be your Guardian; His Suit must passe through my office. Mentivole, He has too much of my blood already; he has, And he gets no more of'tâ Wherefore weep you mother? Enter Mariana and a Sailor. Marian. T'is occasion'd by a sorrow, Wherein you have a childs part, and the mainest, Your Father's dead. CÃ¦sar. Dead? Marian. There's one can relate the rest. Sailor. I can Sir, your Father's drown'd, Most unfortunately drownd. Cesar. How? in a tempest? Sailor. No Sir, in a calme, calme as this evening; the Gunner being drunk, Forgot to fasten the Ordnance to their ports, When came a suddain gust which tumbled them All to the starboord side, o'returnd the ship, And sunck her in moment, some six men That were upon the deck were saved: the rest Perish't with your Father. Claris. O my dearest Fatherâ Cesar. I pray thee leave us. Maria. I have a sorrow of another nature, equall to the former. Cesar. And most commonly they come together. Maria. The Family of the Baptisti Are growne to faction, and upon distast Of the injury late offerd in my house, Have vowd a most severe, and fell revenge 'Gainst all our family, but especially 'Gainst you my deere CÃ¦sario. CÃ¦sar. Let them threat, I am prepard to oppose them. Maria. And is your losse then Of so easie an estimation, what comfort Have I but in your life, and your late danger Presents afore me what I am to suffer, Should you miscarry; therefore ile advise you When the Funerall is over, you would travaile, Both to prevent their fury, and weare out the injury. Cesar. No Mother, I will not travaile, So in my absence he may marry my Sister, I will not travaile certaine. Maria. O my CÃ¦sario, Whom I respect and love 'bove my owne life, Indeed with a kind of dotage, he shall never Goe forth a doores, but the contrary faction Will indanger's life, and then am I most wretched. I am thinking of a strange prevention, Which I shall witnesse with a bleeding eye, Fondnesse sometimes is worse then cruelty.â Exeunt.</field>

Hostesse. Out upon him. Host. A second, a lavolteteere, a saltatory, a dancer with a Kit at his bum, one that by teaching great Madonnas to foot it, has miraculously purchast a ribanded wastcote, and foure cleane paire of socks; a fellow that skips as hee walkes, and instead of sensible discourse vents the curious conceit of some new tune stolne from a Maske, or a bawdie dittie elevated for the Pole Artick of a Ladies chamber, in that fyle stands another of your inamoratoes Hostesse. Hang him and his fiddle together, hee never fidles any child of ours. Host. The third, a Mongrell, got by a Switzer on an Italian, this puppy, being left well estated, comes to Florence, that the world may take notice, how impossible it is for experience to alter the course of nature, a foole (wife) and indeed a Clown turnd gallant, seldom or never proves other then a gallant foole, this toy prates to little purpose other then what's a clock, shall's go drink, de'e forsooth, and thank ye heartily; I feare no art in him to catch thee, and yet wee must bee tormented with this buzzard amongst the rest. Hostesse. Tis your owne folly, forbid him the house. Host. The 4th, a Mule-driver, a stubborn &amp; a harsh knave: the fifth a School-Master, a very amorous Pedant, run almost mad with study of Sonnets and Complements out of old play-ends, the last an Advocates clerk, that speaks pure Fustion in Law termes, excellent Courtiers all, and all as neate as a Magnifico's post new painted at his entrance to an office; thou shalt have none of 'em. Laugh at 'em doe. I say thou shalt have none of 'em. Bian. Still your command to me shall stand a Law. Host. Now they throng like so many horse-coursers at a faire, in clusters about the man of art, for love powders, ingredients, potions, counsailes, postures, complements, philters: the devill and theâhow now? tumults? batteries, noise? ha, get from my sight. Clown cries within Enter Forobosco and Clowne, his head bloody. Clow. Murther me, do, pound me to Mummye, doe; see what will come on't. Foro. Dog, leave thy snarling, or i'le cut thy tongue out, Thou unlikt beare, darst thou yet stand my fury, My generous rage? yet! by the sulpherous damps That feed the hungry and incessant darknesse, Which curles round the grim Alastors back, Mutter againe, and with one powerfull word, Ile call an Host up from the Stygian lakes, Shall waft thee to the Acherontick fennes; Where choak't with mists as black as thy impostors, Thou shalt live still a dying. Clow. Conjure mee to the devill and you can. I live in hell upon earth 'em already, and you had any mercy, you would not practise upon a kind heart thus. Host. You have drawne blood from him Signior, Is his offence unpardonable? Foro. A lump of ignorance, pray speak not for him, A drowsie grossenesse, in all christian kingdomes, The mention of my art, my name, my practise Merit and glory hath begot at once Delight and wonder; ile not be entreated; Spare intercession for him,âÃ´ thou scorne Of learning, shame of duty; must thy sloth Draw my just fame in question? I discharge thee From my service; see me no more henceforth. Clow. Discharge me, is that my yeares wages! Ile not be so answerd. Foro. Not Camell, sirra I am liberall to thee; Thou hast thy life, begon. Clow. Vengeance, sweet vengeance. Foro. Do'e mumble? Clow. Ile be revengd, monstrously, sudainly, and insatiably; my bulke begins to swell. Foro. Homotolenton, Pragmatophoros, Heliostycorax. Clow. Call up your spirits, I defie 'em; well have law for my broken pate, twelve ounces of pure bloud; Troy-weight. In despight of thee my Master, and thy Master the grand devill himselfe, vindicta, vindicta.â Exit. Host. Signior you are exceeding mov'd. Hostes. Mercy upon us, what terrible words thou talk't? Foro. A slave, a curreâbut be not you affrighted Young Virgin, 'twere an injury to sweetnesse: Should any rough sound draw from your cheekes, The pretious tincture which makes nature proud Of her own workmanship. Host. Wise, Marke, mark that wise. Bian. Shake then your anger off Sir; Foro. You command it Faire one, mine Host and Hostesse, with your leaves I have a motion joyntly to you all. Hostesse. An honest one I hope. Host. Well put in wife. Foro. A very necessary one, the Messe Stooles out. And halfe of suiters, that attend to usher Their loves sir reverence to your daughter, waite With one consent, which can best please her eye; In offering at a dance, I have provided Musick. And 'twill be something I dare promise Worthy your laughter, shal they have admittance? H. By any means, for I am perswaded the manner will be so Ridiculous, that it will confirm the assurance of their Miserable fooleries, but no longer trouble with 'em here, Then they are in these May-games. Foro. So I am resolvd. Hostesse. Nor any wise word of sencelesse love. Foro. Not any; I have charm'd them, did you see How they prepared themselves, how they stroak up Their foretops, how they justle for the Looking-glasse, To set their Faces by it; (See they muster. You would look for some most impossible antick. Enter Tailor, Dancer, Mule Driver, Schoole-Master, Clarke: (all with severall papers, and present 'em to Forobosco.) Host. So, so, so, so, here flutter the nest of hornets, the hotch-potch of rascallity, now, now, now, now, the dunghill of corruption hath yawnd forth the burthen of abhomination. I am vext, vext to the soule, will rid my house of this unchristend fry, and never open my doores again. Foro. Some other time, ile give no answer now, But have preferred your suits, here shew your cunning. First every one in order do his honour To the faire mark you shoot at; courtly, courtly, Convay your severall loves in lively measure: Come, let us take our seates, some sprightly musick. Host. Dance all and part, tis a very necessary farewell. Enter CÃ¦sario, They all make ridiculous tonges, to Bianca: ranck themselves, and dance in severall postures: during the dance. Enter CÃ¦sario, and stands off. Host. Well done my lusty blouds, preciously well done, One lusty rouse of wine, and take leave on all sides. CÃ¦sar. Thanks for your revells Gentlemen; accept This Gold, and drink as freely as you danc'd. Host. My noble Lord Cesario, cleer the rooms sirs. Foro. Away. Attend your answers. âExeunt Foro. and those that Danc'd. CÃ¦sar. With your favour Rolando, I would change a word or two with your faire daughter. Host. At your Lordships pleasure, come wise, no muttering, have a care girle, my love, service, and duty to your good Lordship. âExeunt and Wife. CÃ¦sar. My often visits (sweet Bianca) cannot But constantly inform thy judgment, wherein Thy happinesse consists, for to steale minutes From great imployments, to converse with beauty, Lodg'd in so meane a fortune, to lay by Consideration of the unequall distance Between my blood and thine, to shun occasions Of courtship with the Ladies of the time: Noble, and faire, only for love to thee, Must of necessity invite a tendernesse; As low as nature could have stampt a bond womans. To entertaine quick motions of rare gratitude For my uncommon favours. Bian. Deed my Lord, as far as my simplicity can leade mee, I freely thank your curtesies. Cesar. To thank them, is to reward them pretty one. Bian. Then teach me How I may give them back again; in truth I never yet receiv'd a paire of Gloves: A trifling ring from any that expected An equall satisfaction, but as willingly I parted with the gift unto the owner, as he bestowd it. Cesar. But I pow're before thee Such plenties, as it lyes not in the ability Of thy whole kindred to returne proportionable One for a thousand. Bian. You my Lord conclude For my instruction, to ingage a debt Beyond a possibilitie of paiment, I ever thought a sinne; and therefore justly Without conceit of scorne or curious rudenesse, I must refuse your bounty. Cesar. Canst thou love? Bian. Love! is there such a word in any language That carries honest sence? Cesar. Never dwelt ignorance In so sweet-shap't a building, love Bianca, Is that firme knot which tyes two hearts in one, Shall ours be tyed so? Bian. Vse a plainer word, My Lord. Insteed of tyes, say marries hearts, Then I may understand. Cesar. Their hearts are married Whose enterchange of pleasures and embraces, Soft kisses, and the privacies of sweetes, Keeps constant league together, when temptation Of great mens oathes and gifts shall urge contempt, Rather then batter resolution, novelty Of sights, or taste of new delights in wantonnesse, Breeds surfeit it more then appetite in any Reserv'd to noble vowes; my excellent maide Live thou but true to me, and my contents, Mine only, that no partner may pertake The treasure of those sweets thy youth yet glories in And I will raise thy lownesse to abundance Of all varieties, and more triumph In such a mistris, then great Princes doating On truth-betraying wives. Bian. Thus to yeeld up then The cottage of my vertue to be swallow'd By some hard-neighboring landlord such as you are Is in effect to love, a Lord so vicious! O where shall innocence find some poore dwelling Free from temptations tirrany. Cesar. Nay prethee; Byan. Gay clothes, high feeding, easie beds of lust, Change of unseemly sights; with base discourse, Draw curses on your Pallaces; for my part This I will be confirmd in, I will eate The bread of labour, know no other rest Then what is earnd from honest paines, ere once more Lend eare to your vild toyles; Sir, would you were As noble in desires, as I could be in knowing vertue. Pray doe not afflict a poore soule thus. CÃ¦sar. I sweare.âto me?â Bianca steales off. Gen. The Duke my Lord commands your speedy presence For answering agreivances late urg'd Against you by your Mother. CÃ¦sar. By my Mother. Gent. The Court is neere on sitting. Cesar. I waite on it Sir,â Exeunt. Enter Duke, Magistrate, Secretary, Baptista, Attendants, Mentivole: (they sit) Mentivole stands by. Duke. What wast of bloud, what tumults, what divisions, What outrages, what uprores in a state, Factions though issuing from meane springs at first Have (not restraind) flowed to, the sad example At Rome betweene the Ursins and Columnies, Nay here at home in Florence, twixt the Neers And the Bianchi can too mainly witnesse. I sit not at the helme (my Lords) of soveraignty Deputed Pilot for the Common-wealth, To sleep whiles others steere (as their wild fancies Shall councell) by the compasse of disorders. Baptista, This short Preface is directed Chiefly to you, the petty brawles and quarrels Late urg'd betwixt th'Alberti and your family Must, yes and shall like tender unknit joynts Fasten againe together of themselves: Or like an angry Chyrurgion, we will use The roughnesse of our justice, to cut off The stubborne rancour of the limbes offending. Bap. Most gracious Florence. Duke. Our command was signified, That neither of the followers of each party Should appeare here with weapons. Bap. Tis obeyd Sir, on my side. Duke. We must leave the generall cause Of State employments to give eare to brawles Of some particular grudges, pollitick government For tutord Princes, but no more henceforth. Ent. Mariana, and Clarissa, at one door Cesario at the other. Our frowne shall check presumption, not our clemency, Mari. All blessings due to unpartiall Princes, Crowne Florence with eternity of happinesse. Cesar. If double praiers can double blessings (great Sir) Mine joyne for your prosperity with my mothers. Duke. Rise both; now briefly (Lady) without circumstance Deliver those agrievances which lately Your importunity possest our counsaile Were fit for audience, wherein you petitiond, You might be heard without an Advocate Which boone you find is granted. Mari. Though divided. I stand between the laws of truth and modesty, Yet let my griefes have vent: Yet the cleernesse Of strange necessity requires obedience To nature and your mercy, in my weeds Of mourning, emblems of too deer misfortunes, Badges of griefes, and Widdowhood, the burthen Of my charg'd soule must be layd downe before you; Wherein if strict opinion cancell shame, My frailty is my plea; Stand forth young man, And heare a story that will strike all reason Into amasement. Cesar. I attend. Mar. Alberto (peace dwell upon his ashes) still the husband Of my remembrance and unchanging vowes, Has by his death left to his heire possession Of faire revenew, which this young man claymes As his inheritance. I urgd him gently, Friendly, and privately to grant a partage Of this estate to her who ownes it all This his supposed Sister. Bap. How supposed? Cesar. Pray Madam recollect your selfe. Mar. The relish Of a strange truth begins to work like Physick Already: I have bitternesse to mingle With these preparatives, so deadly loathsome; It will quite choake digestion; shortly heare it Cesario, for I dare not rob unjustly The poore soule of his name; this, this Cesario Neither for Father had Alberto, me For Mother, nor Clarissa for his Sister. Claris. Mother, Ã´ Mother. Ment. I am in a Dream sure. Duke. No interruptions. Lady on, Maria. How ever Bap. A Faulkners sonne: Mari. Mistake not Great Duke of Tuscany or the beginning Or processe of this novelty; my husband The now deceasd Alberto, from his youth In-urd to an impatiency, and roughnesse Of disposition, when not mauy monthes After our marriage were worne out, repin'd At the unfruitfull barrennesse of youth, Which as he pleasd to terme it, cut our hops off From blessing of some issue, to prevent it; I grew ambitious of no fairer honor Then to preserve her love, and asoccasions Still call'd him from me, studied in his absence How I might frame his welcome home with comfort. At last I faynd my selfe with child; the Message Of freedome or reliefe to one halfe stervd In prison is not utterd with such greedinesse; Of expectation and delight as this was To my much affected Lord, his care, his goodnesse; (Pardon me that I use the word) exceeded All former feares, the houre of my deliverance As I pretended drawing nee'r, I fashiond My birth-rights at a Country Garden house, Where then my Faulkners wife was brought a bed Of this Cesario; him I ownd for mine; Presented him unto a joyfull Father. Duke. Can you prove this true? Mari. Proofes I have most evident; But O the curse of my impatiency; shortly Ere three new Moones had spent their borrowed lights, I grew with child indeed, so just is Heaven, The issue of which burthen was this daughter; Iudge now most gracious Prince my Lords and you, What combats then and since I have indur'd Between a mothers piety and weakenesse Of a Soul trembling wife; to have reveal'd This secret to Alberto, had bin danger Of ruine to my fame, besides the conflict Of his distractious; now to have supprest it, Were to defeate my child, my only child, Of her most lawfull honors, and inheritance. CÃ¦sario, th'art a man still, Education Hath moulded thee a Gentleman, continue so; Let not this fall from greatnesse, sinke thee lower Then worthy thoughts may warrant, yet disclaime All interest in Albertos blood, thou hast not One drop of his or mine. Duke. Produce your witnesse. Marian. The Faulconers wise his mother, And such women as waited then upon me, Sworne to the privacy of this great secret. Duke. Give them all their oathes. Cesar. O let me crave forberance, gracious Sir, Vouchsafe me hearing. Duke. Speake CÃ¦sario. Cesar. Thus long I have stood silent, and with no unwillingnesse, Attended the relation of my fall, From a fair expectation; what I fear'd (Since the first sillable this Lady utter'd Of my not being hers) benevolent Fates Have eas'd me off; for to be basely born, If not base-born, detracts not from the bounty Of natures freedom or an honest birth. Nobilitie claym'd by the right of blood, Shewes chiefly that our Ancestors desir'd What we inherit; but that man whose actions Purchase a reall merit to himselfe, And rancks him in the file of of prayse and honour, Creates his own advancement; let me want The fuell which best feedes the fires of greatnesse, Lordly possessions, yet shall still my gratitude By some attempts of mention not unworthy Indeavour to returne a fit acquittance To that large debt I owe your favours (Madam) And great Alberto's memory and goodnesse; O that I could as gently shake off passion For the losse of what great brave man as I can shakeoff Remembrance of that once I was reputed; I have not much to say, this Princely presence Needs not too strictly to examine farther The truth of this acknowledgment; a mother Dares never disavowe her only sonne, And any woman must come short of Piety, That can or dis-inherit her own issue, Or feares the voice of rumor for a stranger. Madam, you have confest, my Father was A servant to your Lord and you: by interest Of being his sonne, I cannot but claime justly The honour of continuing still my service To you and yours; which granted, I beg leave I may for this time be dismist. Duke. Bold spirit. Bap. I love thee now with pitty; Duke. Goe not yetâ A suddain tempest that might shake a rock, Yet he stands firm against it; much it moves me, He not Alberto's sonne, and she a widdow, And she a widdow,âLords your eare. Omnes. Your pleasure.â Whispers. Duke. So, Lady, what you heard avouch't is truth. Mari. Truth onely, gracious Sir. Duke. Heare then our Sentence, Since from his cradle you have fed and fostered CÃ¦sario as your sonne, and train'd him up To hopes of greatnesse; which now in a moment You utterly againe have ruin'd, this way We with our Councell are resolv'd, you being A widdow shall accept him for a husband. Maria. Husband to me Sir? Duke. T'is in us to raise him To honours, and his vertues will deserve 'em. Maria. But Sir, 'tis in no Prince nor his preogative, To force a womans choice against her heart. Duke. True, if then you appeale to higher justice, Our doome includes this clause upon refusall Out of your Lords revenues shall CÃ¦sario Assure to any whom he takes for wife The inheritance of three parts; the lesse remainer Is dowry large enough to marry a daughter; And we by our prerogative which you question Will publiquely adopt him into'th name Of your deceas'd Alberto, that the memory Of so approv'd a Peer may live in him That can preserve his memory lesse you find out Some other meanes which may as amply satisfie His wrong, our Sentence stands irrevocable: What think you Lords? Omnes. The Duke is just and honorable. Bap. Let me embrace CÃ¦sario, henceforth ever I vow a constant friendship. Mentivole. I remit all former difference. Cesar. I am too poore In words to thanke this Iustice. Madam alwayes My studies shall be love to you, and duty. Duke Replyes we admit none. CÃ¦sario waite on us. Exeunt. Manent Mentivole, Bap. Mari. Claris. Bap. Mentivole. Bap. Mentivole. Menti. My Lord. Bap. Looke on Clarissa, shee's noble, rich, young, faire. Mentivole. My Lord, and vertuous. Bap. Mentivole and vertuous.âMadam. Maria. Tyranny of justice, I shall live reports derision, That am compeld to exchange a gracefull widdow-hood For a continuall Martyrdome in marriage, With one so much beneath me. Bap. I'le plead for ye Boldly and constantly, let your daughter only Admit my sonne her servant, at next visit Madam ile be a messenger of comfort. Mentivole, be confident and earnest. Exit. Maria. Married again, to him too! better t'had been The young man should have still retain'd the honors Of old Albertos son, then I the shame Of making him successor of his bed; I was too blam, Ment. Indeed without offence, Madame I thinke you were, Claris. You urge it fairely, and like a worthy freind. Maria. can you say any thing In commendation of a Mushroome withered Assoone as started up? Ment. You scorne an Innocent Of noble growth, for whiles your husband liv'd I have heard you boast Cesario in all actions Gave matter of report of Imitation, Wonder and envy; let not discontinuance Of some few dayes estrange a sweet opinion Of vertue, cheifely when in such extremity, Your pitty not contempt will argue goodnesse. Maria. O Sir, Cla. If you would use a thriving courtship, You cannot utter a more powerfull language That I shall listen to with greater greedinesse Then th'argument you prosecute; this speakes you A man compleat and excellent; Ment. I speake not, they are his owne deserts. Maria. Good Sir forbeare, I am now fully sensible of running Into a violent Lethargy, whose deadlinesse Locks up all reason, I shall never henceforth Remember my past happinesse. Ment. These clouds may be disperst, Maria. I feare continuall night Will over-shroud me, yet poore youth his trespasse Lies in his fortune, not the cruelty Of the Dukes sentence. Cla. I dare thinke it does, Maria. If all faile I will learne thee to conquer Adversity with sufferance. Ment. You resolve Nobly. Exeunt.</field>

Each then in order, And differ not for precedency. Dan. I am buying of an office sir, And to that purpose I would faine learne to dissemble cunningly. Foro. Doe you come to me for that? you should rather Have gone to a cunning woman. Danc. I sir but their Instructions are but like women, Pretty well but not to the depth, as I'de have it, You are a conjurer, the devils master, And I would learn it from you so exactly, Foro. That the divill himselfe Might not go beyond you, Danc. You are ith right sir. Foro. And so your mony for your purchase Might come in againe within a 12 month. Danc.

Foro. I conceave you, you would have me furnish you With a spirit to informe you. Cox. But as quiet a Divell as the woman, The first day and a halfe after she's married, I can by no meanes indure a terrible one. Foro. No, no, Ile qualifie him, He shall not fright you, It shall be the ghost of some lying Stationer, A Spirit shall looke as if butter would not melt in his mouth, A new Mercurius Gallobelgious. Coxe. O there was a captaine was rare at it, Foro. Nere thinke of him, Though that captaine writ a full hand gallop, And wasted indeed more harmelesse paper then Ever did laxative Physick, Yet wil I make you to out-scribble him, And set downe what you please, The world shall better beleeve you.

Why thats it I come about sir, Tis a Divel of your raising must invent 'em, I confesse I am too weake to compasse it. Foro. So sir, then you make it a matter of no difficulty To have them tolerated. Pedant. Trouble not your selfe for that, Let but your Divel set them a foot once, I have Weavers, and Ginger-bread makers, And mighty AquavitÃ¦-men, shall set them a going. Foro. This is somewhat difficult, And will aske some conference with the divell. Ped. Take your owne leasure sir, I have another busines too, because I meane To leave Jtaly, and bury my selfe in those neather parts Of the low countries. Foro. Whats that sir. Ped. Marry I would faine make 9 dayes to the weeke, for the more ample benefit of the captaine. Foro. You have a shrewd pate sir. Ped. But how this might be compasd? Foro. Compasd easily; tis but making A new Almanacke, and dividing the compasse Of the yeare into larger penny-worths, As a Chandler with his compasse makes A Geometrick proportion of the Holland cheese He retailes by stivers. But for getting of it licenc'd. Ped. Trouble not your selfe with that sir, Theres your mony, Foro. For foure new sects of religions, And 9 dayes to the weeke. Ped.

Yes sir, and will not steale from you The least part of that commendation I have heard utterd. Taylor. I take measure of your worth sir, And because I will not afflict you with any large bill Of circumstances, I will snip off particulars. I would faine invent some strange And exquisite new fashions. Foro. Are you not travel'd sir. Tay. Yes sir, but have observ'd all we can see Or invent are but old ones with new names to'em, Now I would some way or other grow more curious. Foro. Let me see to devise new fashions. Were you never in the Moone? Tay. In the Moone taverne! yes sir: often. Foro. No, I do meane in the new world, In the world thats in the Moone yonder. Tay. How? a new world ith moone? Foro. Yes I assure you. Tay. And peopled? Foro. O most fantastically peopled. Tay. Nay certaine then ther's worke for taylors? Foro. That there is I assure you. Tay. Yet I have talked with a Scotch taylor That never discover'd so much to me, Though he has travail'd far, and was a pedlar in Poland. Foro. That was out of his way, This lies beyond China, You would study new fashions you say? Take my councell, make a voyage, And discover that new world. Tay. Shall I be a moon-man? Foro. I am of opinion, the people of that world (Jf they be like the nature of that climate they live in) Do vary the fashion of their cloathes oftner then any Quick-silver'd nation in Europe. Tay. Not unlikely, but what should that be we call The man in the moone then? Foro. Why tis nothing but an Englishman That stands there starke naked, With a paire of sheires in one hand, And a great bundle of broad cloath in the other (Which resembles the bush of thornes) Cutting out of new fashions. Taylor. I have heard somewhat like this, But how shall I get thither? Foro. Ile make a new compasse shall direct you. Tay. Certaine? Foro. Count me else for no man of direction. Tay. Theres 20 duckats in hand, at my returne Ile give you a 100. Foro. A new voyage to discover new fashions. Mul. I have been a travailer too sir, That have shewed strange beasts in Christendome, And got mony by them, but I finde the trade to decay. Your Camelion, or East-Indian hedg-hog Gets very little mony, and your Elephant devoures So much bread, brings in so little profit, His keeper were better every morning Cram 15 Taylors with white manchet, I would have some new spectacle, And one that might be more attractive. Foro. Let me see, were you ever in Spaine? Mule. Not yet Sir. Foro. I would have you go to Madrill, and against some great festivall, when the court lies there, provide a great and spacious English Oxe, and roste him whole, with a pudding in's belly; that would be the eight wonder of the world in those parts I assure you. Mule. A rare project without question. Foro. Goe beyond all their garlike olla Podrithoes, though you sod one in Garquentuas cauldron, bring in more mony, then all the monsters of Affrick. Host. Good Sir do your best for him; he's of my acquaintance, and one if ye knew himâ Foro. What is he? Host. He was once a man of infinite letters. Foro. A Scholler? Host. No sir, a packet carrier, which is alwaies a man of many letters, you know: then he was Mule-driver, now hee's a gentleman, and feedes monsters. Foro. A most ungratefull calling. Mule. Ther's mony for your direction; the price of the Oxe Sir. Foro. A hundred French crownes, for it must be a Lincolne shire Oxe, and a prime one: For a rare and monstrous spectacle, to be seen at Madrill. Enter Clown, Hostesse, and Bianca. Hostes. Pray forbeare sir, we shall have a new quarrell. Clow. You durst not meet me ith' field, I am therefore come to spoyle your market. Foro. Whats the newes with you sir. Clow. Gentlemen, you that come hither to be most abominably cheated, listen, and be as wise as your plannet will suffer you, keep your mony, be not guld, be not laught at. Pedant. What meanes this? would I had my mony againe in my pocket. Host. The fellow is full of malice, do not mind him. Clow. This profest cheating rogue was my master, and I confesse my selfe a more preternotorious rogue then himselfe, in so long keeping his villainous counsell. Foro. Come, come, I will not heare you. Clow. No couzner, thou wouldest not heare me, I do but dare thee to suffer me to speake, and then thou and all thy divells spit fire, and spoute Aqua fortis. Foro. Speake on, I freely permit thee. Clow. Why then know all you simple animals, you whose purses are ready to cast the calfe, if they have not cast it already, if you give any credit this jugling rascal, you are worse then simple widgins, and will be drawne into the net by this decoy ducke, this tame cheater. Foro. Ha, ha, ha, pray marke him. Clow. He does professe Physicke, and counjuring; for his Physicke; he has but two medicins for all manner of diseases; when he was i'th low countryes, he us'd nothing but butterd beere, colourd with Allegant, for all kind of maladies, and that he called his catholick medicine; sure the ducth smelt out it was butterd beere, else they would never have endur'd it for the names sake: then does he minister a grated dogs turd instead of Rubarbe, many times of Vnicornes horne, which working strongly with the conceit of the Patient, would make them bescummer to the height of a mighty purgation. Foro. The rogue has studied this invective. Clow. Now for his conjuring, the witches of Lapland are the divells chaire-women to him, for they will sell a man a winde to some purpose; he sells winde, and tells you fortye lyes over and over. Hostess. I thought what we should find of him. Host. Hold your prating, be not you an hereticke. Clow. Conjure! Ile tell you, all the divells names he calls upon, are but fustian names, gatherd out of welch heraldry; in breife, he is a rogue of six reprieves, foure pardones of course, thrice pilloried, twince sung LacrymÃ¦ to the Virginalls of a carts taile, h'as five times been in the Gallies, and will never truly run himselfe out of breath, till he comes to the gallowes. Foro. You have heard worthy gentlemen, what this lying detracting rascall has vomited. Tay. Yes certaine, but we have a better trust in you, for you have taine our mony. Foro. I have so, truth is he was my servant, and for some chastisement I gave him, he does practise thus upon me; speake truly sirra, are you certaine I cannot conjure? Clow. Conjure! ha, ha, ha. Foro. Nay, nay, but be very sure of it. Clow. Sure of it? why Ile make a bargaine with thee, before all these gentlemen, use all thy art, all thy roguery, and make me do any thing before al this company I have not a mind to, Ile first give thee leave to claime me for thy bond slave, and when thou hast done hang me. Foro. Tis a match, sirra, Ile make you caper ith' aire presently. Clow. I have too solid a body, and my beleife is like a Puritans on Good-Friday, too high fed with capon. Foro. I will first send thee to Greeke, land for a haunch of venison, just of the thicknesse of thine own tallow. Clow. Ha, ha, ha, Ile not stir an inch for thee. Foro. Thence to Amboyna ith' East-Jndies, for pepper to bake it. Clow. To Amboyna? so I might be pepperd. Foro. Then will I conveigh thee strark naked to Develing to beg a paire of brogs, to hide thy mountainous buttocks. Clow. And no doublet to 'em? Foro. No sir, I intend to send you of a sleevelesse errand; but before you vanish, in regard you say I cannot conjure, and ar so stupid, and opinionated a slave, that neither I, nor my art can compell you to do any thing thats beyond your own pleasure, the gentlemen shall have some sport; you cannot endure a cat sirra? Clow. Whats that to thee Iugler? Foro. Nor you'l do nothing at my entreaty? Clow. Ile be hang'd first. Foro. Sit Gentlemen, and whatsoever you see, be not frighted, Hostess. Alas I can endure no coniuring. Host. Stir not wise. Bian. Pray let me go sir, I am not fit for these fooleryes. Host. Move not daughter. For. I wil make you dance a new dance calld leap-frog. Clow. Ha, ha, ha. Fro. And as naked as a frog. Clow. Ha, ha, ha, I defye thee. Foro. lookes in a booke, strikes with his wand, Musick playes. Enter 4. Boyes shap't like Frogs, and dance. Pedant. Spirits of the water in the likenes of frogs. Tay. he has fisht faire beleeve me. Mule. See, see, he sweats and trembles. Foro. Are you come to your quavers? Clow. Oh, oh, oh. Foro. Ile make you run division on that o's ere I leave you; looke you, here are the play fellowes that are so indeerd to you; come sir, first uncase, and then dance, nay Ile make him daunce stark naked. Host. Oh let him have his shirt on, and his Mogols breeches, here are women ith' house. Foro. Well for their sakes he shall. Clown teares off his doublet, making strange faces as if compeld to it, falls into the Daunce. Tay. He daunces, what a lying rogue was this to say the gentleman could not conjure? Foro. He does prettily well, but tis voluntary, I assure you, I have no hand in't. Clow. As you are a Counjurer, and a rare Artist, free me from these couplets; of all creatures I cannot endure a Frog. Foro. But your dauncing is voluntary, I can compell you to nothing. Hostes. O me, daughter, lets take heed of this fellow, he'le make us dance naked, an' we vex him. âExeunt Hostesse and Bianca. Foro. Now cut capers sirra, Ile plague that chin of yours. Clow. Oh, oh, oh, my kidneys are rosted, I drop away like a pound of butter rosted. Tayl. He will daunce himselfe to death. Foro. No matter Ile sell his fat to the Pothecaries, and repaire my injury that way. Host. Enough in conscience. Foro. Well, at your entreaty vanish. And now I wil only make him breake his neck in doing a sommerset, and thats all the revenge I meane to take of him. Clow. O gentlemen, what a rogue was I to belye so an approved Master in the noble dark science? you can witnesse, this I did only to spoyle his practise and deprive you of the happynesse of injoying his worthy labours; rogue that I was to do it, pray sir forgive me. Foro. With what face canst thou ask it? Clow. With such a face as I deserve, with a hanging looke, as all here can testifie. Foro. Well gentlemen, that you may perceive the goodnes of my temper, I will entertain this rogue again in hope of amendment, for should I turn him off, he would be hanged. Clow. You may read that in this foule coppy. Foro. Only with this promise, you shall never cozen any of my patients. Clow. Never. Foro. And remember hence forward, that though I cannot counjure, I can make you daunce sirra, go get your selfe into the cottage againe.â Enter CÃ¦sario. Clow. I will never more daunce leape Frog: now I have got you into credit, hold it up, and cozen them in abundance. Foro. Oh rare rascall. âExit Clown. Cesar. How now, a Frankford mart here, a Mountebanke, and his worshipfull auditory. Host. They are my ghuests Sir. Cesar. Aâupon them, shew your jugling tricks in some other roome. Host, And why not here Sir? Cesar. Hence, or sirra I shall spoile your figure flinging, and all their radicall questions. Omnes. Sir we vanish.â Exeunt. Manet Host. &amp; CÃ¦sar. Host. Signior CÃ¦sario, you make bold with me, And somewhat I must tell you to a degree of ill manners, they are my ghuests, and men I live by, And I would know by what authority You command thus far. Cesar. By my interest in your daughter. Host. Interest do you call't? as I remember I never put her out to Vsury on that condition. Cesar. Pray thee be not angry. Enter Bianca and Hostesse. Hostes. I am come to make thee happy, and her happy: Shee's here; alas my pretty soule, I am come To give assurance thats beyond thy hope, Or thy beleife, I bring repentance 'bout me, And satisfaction, I will marry thee. Bianca. Ha? CÃ¦sar. As I live I will, but do not entertain't With too quick an apprehension of joy, For that may hurt thee, I have heard some dye of't, Bian. Do not feare me. CÃ¦sar. Then thou think'st I faigne This protestation, I will instantly Before this testimony, my new alliance, Contract my selfe unto thee, then I hope We may be more private. Host. But thou shalt not sir, For so has many a maiden-head been lost, and many a bastard gotten, Ces. Then to give you the best of any assurance in the world, Entreat thy father to goe fetch a Preist Wee will instantly to bed, and there be married. Bian. Pride hath not yet fosaken you I see, Though prosperity has. Host. Sir you are too confident To fashion to your selfe a dreame of purchase When you are a begger, Ces. you are bold with me. Hostes. Doe we not know your value is cried downe Fourescore i'th hundred. Bian. Oh sir I did love you With such a fixed heart, that in that minute Wherein you slighted, or contemn'd me rather, I tooke a vow to obey your last decree, And never more looke up at any hope Should bring me comfort that way, and though since Your Foster-mother, and the faire Clarissa Have in the way of marriage despis'd you, That hath not any way bred my revenge, But compassion rather. I have found So much sorrow in the way to a chaste wedlock That here I will set downe, and never wish To come to'th journies end. Your suite to mee Henceforth be ever silenc't. Cesar. My Bianca. Hostes. Henceforward pray forbeare her and my house: She's a poore vertuous wench, yet her estate May weigh with yours in a gold balance. Host. Yes, and her birth in any Heralds office in Christendome. Hostes. It may prove so: When you'l say, you have leapt a Whiteing. Exit. Enter Baptista and Mentivole. Ces, How far am I growne behind hand with fortune? Bap. Here's Cesario: My son sir is to morrow to be married Vnto the faire Clarissa, Ces. So. Ment. Wee hope youle be a gueste there? Ces. No I will not grace your triumph so much. Bap. I will not tax your breeding. But it alters not your birth sir, fare you well. Ment. Oh sir doe not greive him, He has to much affliction already. Exeunt. Enter a Sailor. Ces. Every way scorn'd and lost, Shame follow you For I am growne most miserable. Sail. Sir doe you know a Ladies son in towne here They cal Cesario? Cesar.

With mee Sir; despise not this pitcht Canvas; the time was wee have knowne them lined with Spanish Duckets; I have news for you: Cesar. For me! Sail. Not unlesse you'l drink; We are like our Sea provision, once out of pickle, We require abundance of drink; I have news to tell you That were you Prince, Would make you send your mandate To have a thousand bonfires made 'ith City, And pist out agen with nothing but Greek wine. Cesar. Come, I wil drink with thee howsoever, Sail. And upon these terms I wil utter my mind to you. Exeunt.</field>

O my most worthy Prospero, my best friend, The noble favor I receivd from thee In freeing me from the Turks I now accompt Worse than my death; for I shall never live To make requitall; what doe you attend for? Sail. To understand your pleasure. Alber. They doe mock me; I doe protest I have no kind of pleasure In any thing i'th world, but in thy friendship, I must ever except that. Pros. Pray leave him, leave him.â Exeunt Sailors. Alber. The newes I heard related since my landing Of the division of my Family, How is it possible for any man To bear't with a set patience? Pros. You have suffer'd Since your imprisonment more waighty sorrowes. Alber. I, then I was a man of flesh and bloud, Now I am made up of fire, to the full height Of a deadly Calenture; Ã´ these vild women That are so ill preservers of mens honors, They cannot governe their own honesties, That I should thirty and odde winters feed My expectation of a noble heire, And by a womans falshood finde him now A fiction, a meare dreame of what he was; And yet I love him still. Pros. In my opinion The sentence (on this tryall) from the Duke Was noble, to repaire Cesarios losse With the marriage of your wife, had you been dead. Alber. By your favor but it was not, I conceive T'was disparagment to my name, to have my widdow Match with a Faulkners son, and yet beleev't I love the youth still, and much pitty him. I doe remember at my going to Sea, Vpon a quarrell, and a hurt receiv'd From young Mentivole, my rage so farre Oretopt my nobler temper, I gave charge To have his hand cut off, which since I heard, And to my comfort, brave CÃ¦sario, Worthyly prevented. Pros. And 'twas nobly done. Albert. Yet the revenge, for this intent of mine Hath bred much slaughter in our families, And yet my wife (which infinitly moanes me) Intends to marry my sole heire Clarissa To the head branch of the other faction. Pros. Tis the meane to work reconcilement. Alber. Betweene whom? Pros. Your selfe, and the worthy Baptista. Alber. Never. Pros. O you have been of a noble and remarkable freindship, And by this match tis generally in Florence Hop'd, twill fully be reconcild; to me 'Twould be absolute content. Iulia. And to my selfe, I have maine interest in it. Alb. Noble Sir, you may command my heart to breake for you But never to bend that way; poore CÃ¦sario, When thou pust'st on thy mournfull willow garland, Thy enemy shall be suted (I do vow) In the same livery, my CÃ¦sario Loved as my foster child, though not my sonne, Which in some countryes formerly were barbarous, Was a name held most affectionate; thou art lost, Vnfortunate young man, not only slighted Where thou received'st thy breeding, but since scorn'd Ith' way of marriage, by the poore Bianca The In-keepers daughter. Pros. I have heard of that too; But let not that afflict you; for this Lady May happily deliver at more leasure A circumstance may draw a faire event, Better then you can hope for. For this present we must leave you, And shall visit you againe within these two houres. âEnter CÃ¦sario. Albert. Ever to me most welcome,âO my CÃ¦sario. CÃ¦sar. I am none of yours Sir, so tis protested; And I humbly beg, Since tis not in your power to preserve me Any longer in a noble course of life, Give me a worthy death. Alber. The youth is mad. CÃ¦sar. Nay Sir, I will instruct you in a way To kill me honorably. Alber. That were most strange. CÃ¦sar. I am turning Pirate, You may be imployed By the Duke to fetch me in; and in a sea-fight Give me a noble grave. Alber. Questionlesse he's mad; I would give any Doctor A thousand crownes to free him from this sorrow. CÃ¦sar. Here's the Physitian.â Shewes a Poniard. Alber. Hold Sir, I did say To free you from the sorrow, not from life. CÃ¦sar. Why life and sorrow are unseparable. Alber. Be comforted CÃ¦sario, Mentivole Shall not marry Clarissa. CÃ¦sar. No Sir, ere he shall, Ile kill him. Alber. But you forfeit your own life then. CÃ¦sar. Thats worth nothing. Alber. CÃ¦sario, be thy selfe, be mine CÃ¦sario, Make not thy selfe uncapable of that portion I have full purpose to confer upon thee; By falling into madnesse, beare thy wrongs With noble patience, the afflicted freind Which ever in all actions crownes the end. Ces. You well awake me; nay recover'd me Both to sence and full life, Ã´ most noble sir, Though I have lost my fortune, and lost you For a worthy Father: yet I will not loose My former vertue, my integrity Shall not yet forsake me; but as the wilde Ivy, Spredds and thrives better in some pittious ruin Of tower, or defac'd Temple, then it does Planted by a new buildingâso shall I Make my adversity my instrument To winde me up into a full content. Alber. Tis worthily resolv'd; our first adventure Is to stop the marriage; for thy other losses, Practis'd by a womans malice, but account them Like conjurers windes rais'd to a fearefull blast, And doe some mischeife, but do never last. Exeunt. Enter Forobosco and Clowne. Clow. Now sir, will you not acknowledge that I have mightily advancte your practice? Forobos. Tis confest, and I will make thee a great man for't. Clow. I take a course to do that my selfe, for I drinke sack in abundance. Foro. O my rare rascall. We must remove. Clow. Whither? Foro. Any whither: Europe is to little to be cozned by us, I am ambitious to goe to the East-Indies, thou and I to ride on our brace of Elephants. Clow. And for my part I long to be in England agen; you will never get so much as in England, we have shifted many countryes, and many names: but traunce the world over you shall never purse up so much gold as when you were in England, and call'd your selfe Doctor Lambestones. Foro. Twas an atractive name I confesse, women were then my only admirers. Clow. And all their visits was either to further their lust, or reveng injuries. Foro. You should have forty in a morning beleager my closett, and strive who should be cozend first, amongst fourescore love-sick waighting women that has come to me in a morning to learne what fortune should betide them in their first marriage, I have found above 94 to have lost their maidenheads. Clow. By their owne confession, but I was faine to be your male midwife, and worke it out of them by circumstance. Foro. Thou wast, and yet for all this frequent resort of women and thy handling of their urinalls and their cases, thou art not given to lechery, what should be the reason of it? thou hast wholsome flesh enough about thee; me thinkes the divell should tempt thee too't. Clow. What need he do that, when he makes me his instrument to tempt others. Foro. Thou canst not chuse but utter thy rare good parts; thou wast an excellent baude I acknowledge. Clow. Well, and what I have done that way I will spare to speake of all you and I have done sir, and though we shouldâ Foro. We will for England, thats for certaine. Clow. We shall never want there. Foro. Want? the Court of Wards shall want mony first, for I professe my selfe Lord Paramount over fooles and madfolkes. Clow. Do but store your selfe with lyes enough against you come thither, Foro. VVhy thats all the familarity I ever had with the Divell, my guift of lying: they say hees the Father of lyes, and though I cannot conjure, yet I professe my selfe to be one of his poore gossips, I will now reveale to thee a rare peece of service. Clow. VVhat is it my most worshipful Doctor Lambstones. Foro. There is a Captaine come lately from Sea, They call Prosper I saw him this morning Through a chincke of wainscote that divides my lodging And the Host of the house, withdraw my Host, and Hostesse, the faire Biancha, and an antient gentlewoman into their bedchamber; I could not overheare their conference, but I saw such a masse of gold &amp; Iewels, &amp; when he had done he loc't it up into a casket; great joy there was amongst them &amp; forth they are gone into the city, and my Host told me at his going forth he thought he should not returne till after supper; now sir, in their absence will we fall to our picklocks, enter the chamber, seize the Iewels, make an escape from Florence, and wee are made for ever. Clow. But if they should goe to a true conjurer, and fetch us back in a whirlewinde? Foro. Doe not beleeve there is any such fetch in Astrology, and this may be a meanes to make us live honest hereafter. Clow. Tis but an ill road too't that lyes through the high way of theeving. Foro. For indeed I am weary of this trade of fortune-telling, and meane to give all over, when I come into England, for it is a very ticklish quality. Clow. And ith end will hang by a twine thred. Foro. Besides the Island has too many of the profession, they hinder one anothers market. Clow. No, no, the pillory hinders their market. Foro. You know there the jugling captaine. Clow. I theres a sure carde. Foro. Onely the fore-man of their jury is dead, but he dyed like a Roman. Clow. Else tis thought he had made worke for the hangman. Foro. And the very Ball of your false prophets, hee's quasht too. Clow. He did measure the starres with a false yard, and may now travaile to Rome with a morter on's head to see if he can recover his mony that way. Foro. Come, come, lets fish for this casket, and to Sea presently. Clow. We shall never reach London I feare; My minde runs so much of hanging landing at wapping. Enter Mariana. Exeunt. This well may be a day of joy long wish'd for To my Clarissa, shee is innocent. Nor can her youth but with an open bosome Meet Himens pleasing bounties, but to me That am invirond with black guilt and horror It does appeare a funerall though promising much In the conception were hard to mannage But sad in the event, it was not hate But fond indulgence in me to preserve Cesarios threatned life in open court That forc'd me to disclaime him, choosing rather To rob him of his birth-right, and honor Then suffer him to run the hazard of Inrag'de Baptistas fury, while he lives; I know I have a sonne, and the Dukes sentence A while deluded, and this tempest over, When he assures himselfe despaire hath seiz'd him. Knock within. Enter Baptista. I can relieve and raise himâspeake, who is it That presses on my privacies? Sir your pardon. You cannot come unwelcome, though it were To reade my secret thoughts. Bap. Lady to you Mine shall be ever open; Lady said I, That name keeps too much distance, sister rather I should have stilde you, and I now may claime it, Since our divided families are made one By this blessed marriage; to whose honor comes The Duke in person, waited on by all The braveries of his Coutt, to witnesse it, And then to be our ghests, is the bride ready To meet and entertaine him? Maria. She attends the comming of your sonne. Bap. Pray you bring her forth. The Dukes at handâMusick in her loud voyce, Speakes his arrivall. Maria. Shee's prepard to meet it. âExit. Enter Mariana, Clarissa led by two Maides: at the other doore, Baptista meetes with Mentivole, led by two Courtiers, the Duke, Bishop; diverse Attendants: (A Song) whilst they salute. Duke. It were impertinent to wish you joy, Since all joyes dwell about you, Himens torch Was never slighted with a luckier omen, Nor burnt with so much splendor, to defer With fruitlesse complement, the meanes to make Your certain pleasures lawfull to the world; Since in the union of your hearts they are Confirmd already: would but argue us A boaster of our favours; to the Temple And there the sacred knot once tyde, all t'riumphs Our Dukedome can affoord, shall grace your nuptialls. Enter Alberto and CÃ¦sario. Bap. On there. Ment. I hope it is not in the power Of any to crosse us now. Alber. But in the breath Of a wrongd Father I forbid the bands. Cesar. What, doe you stand at gaze? Bap. Risen from the dead! Maria. Although the sea had vomitted up the figure In which thy better part livd long imprisond, True love despising feare, runs thus to meete it. Claris. In duty I kneele to it. Alber. Hence vile wretches, To you I am a substance incorporeall, And not to be prophand, with your vile touch? That could so soone forget me, but such things Are neither worth my anger, nor reproofe. To you great sir, I turne my selfe and these Immediate Ministers of your government, And if in my rude language I transgresse; Ascribe it to the cold remembrance of My services, and not my rugged temper. Duke. Speake freely, be thy language ne're so bitter, To see thee safe Alberto, signes thy pardon. Alber. My pardon? I can need none, if it be not Receivd for an offence. I tamely beare Wrongs, which a slave-born Muscovite would check at. Why if for treason I had beene deliverd Vp to the hangmans Axe, and this dead trunck Vnworthy of a Christian Sepulcher; Exposd a prey to feed the ravenous vulture, The memory of the much I oft did for you, Had you but any touch of gratitude, Or thought of my deservings, would have stopd you From these unjust proceedings. Duke. Heare the motives that did induce us. Alber. I have heard them all, Your highnesse sentence, the whole Court abusd, By the perjuries, and practise of this woman. (Wee pest thou Crocodile) my hopefull son, Whom I dare sweare mine owne, degraded of The honors that descend to him from me: And from that in his love scornd by a creature Whose base birth though made eminent by her beauty, Might well have markd her out Cesarios servant, All this I could have pardond and forgot; But that my daughter with my whole estate So hardly purchasd, is assignd a dower; To one whose Father, and whole family I so detest; that I would loose my essence And be transformed to a Basiliske To look them dead, to mee's an injury, Admits no satisfaction. Bap. Ther's none offerd. Alber. Nor would not be accepted, Though upon thy knees twere tenderd. Maria. Now the storme grows high. Bap. But that I thought thee dead, and in thy death The brinie Ocean had entombd thy name; I would have sought a wife in a Bordello For my Mentivole, and gladly hugd Her spurious Issue as my lawfull Nephewes, Before his blood should ere have mixd with thine; So much I scorne it. Alber. I'll not bandy words, but thus dissolve the contract. Bap. There I meet thee, and seize on whats mine owne. Alber. For all my service, Great Sir grant me the combat with this wretch, That I may scourge his insolence. Baptist. I kneele for it. CÃ¦sar. And to approve my selfe Albertos sonne, I'le be his second upon any odds, Gainst him that dare most of Baptistas race. Menti. Already upon honorable termes, In me thou hast met thy better, for her sake I'le adde no more. Alber. Sir, let our swords decide it. Maria. O stay Sir, and as you would hold the title Of a just Prince, ere you grant licence to These mad-mens fury, lend your private eare To the most distres'd of women. Duke. Speake, tis granted. He takes Mariana aside. Clar. In the meane time, let not Clarissa be A patient looker on, though as yet doubtfull, To whom to bend her knee first, yet to all I stoop thus low in duty, and would wash The dust of fury with my Virgin teares, From his blessd feete, and make them beautifull That would move to conditions of peace, Though with a snaile like pace, they all are wingd To beare you to destruction: reverend sirs, Think on your ancient friendship cÃ¦mented With so much bloud, but shed in noble action, Divided now in passion for a brawle; The makers blush to own, much lov'd CÃ¦sario. Brother, or friend, (each title may prevaile,) Remember with what tendernesse from our child-hood Wee lov'd together, you preferring me Before your selfe, and I so fond of you That it begot suspition in ill mindes That our affection was incestuous. Thinke of that happy time, in which I know That with your deerest blood you had prevented This showre of teares from me Mentivole, My husband, registred in that bright star-chamber, Though now on earth made strangers, be the example And offer in one hande the peacefull Olive Of concord, or if that can be denyed By powerfull intercession in the other Carry the Hermian rod and force atonement, Now we will not bee all marble, Deaths the worst then And hee shall be my bridegroome, offers to kill her selfe Ment. Hold Clarissa, his loving violence needs must Offer in spite of honorâ he snatches away her knife and sets it to his owne breast, she stayes his hand. Duke. Was it to that end then on your religion? Mar. And my hope in heaven Sir. Duke. Wee then will leave entreaties, and make use Of our authority, must I cry ai-me To this unheard of insolence? in my presence To draw your swords, and as all reverence Thats due to majesty were forfeited, cherish this wildenesse! sheath them instantly, and shew an alteration in your lookes, or by my power Alber, Cut of my head Bapt. And mine, rather then heare of peace with this bad man. I'le not alone give up my throat, but suffer Your rage to reach my family. Enter Prospero, Iuliana, Biancha. Alb. And my name to be no more remembred. Duke. What are these? CÃ¦s. Biancha, tis Biancha, still Biancha: but strangely alter'd. Bapt. If that thirteene yeares Of absence could raze from my memory The figure of my freind, I might forget thee; But if thy Image be graven on my heart, Thou art my Prospero. Pros. Thou my Baptista? Duke. A suddaine change! Bap. I dare not aske deere freind If Juliana live! for thats a blessing I am unworthy of, but yet deny not To let me know the place she hath made happy By having there her sepulcher. Pros. If your highnesse please to vouchsafe a patient Eare wee shall make a true relation of a story That shall call on your wonder. Duke. Speake, wee heare you. Pros. Baptistas Fortune in the Genoa court, His banishment, with his faire wises restraint You are acquainted with; what since hath follow'd I faithfully will deliver, ere eight moones After Baptistas absence were compleate, Faire Juliana founde the pleasures that They had injoy'd together were not barren, And blushing at the burthen of her wombe, No father neere to owne it, it drew on A violent sicknesse, which call'd downe compassion From the angry Duke, then carefull of her health. Physitians were enquir'd of, and their judgment Prescrib'd the Bathes of Luca as a meanes For her recovery; to my charge it pleas'd her To be committed; but as on the way Wee journy'd, those throwes only knowne to women Came thick upon her, in a private village. Bap. Shee died? Pros. Have patience, she brought to the world A hopefull daughter; for her bodies sicknesse It soone decai'd, but the greife of her minde Hourely increas'd, and life grew tedious to her, And desperate ere to see you; she injoyn'd me To place her in a Greeekish Monastery, And to my care gave up her pretty daughter. Bapt. What monastery? as a Pilgrim bare-foot, Ile search it out. Pros. Pray you interrupt me not, Now to my fortunes; the girle well dispos'd off With a faithfull freind of mine, my cruell fate Made me a prisoner to the Turkish gallies, Where for 12 yeares, these hands tugd at the oare, But fortune tyr'd at length with my afflictions, Some ships of Malta mett the Ottaman fleete, Charg'd them and boorded them, and gave me freedome With my deliverers I serv'd, and gott Such reputation with the great Master That he gave me command over a tall And lusty ship, where my first happy service Was to redeeme Alberto rumor'd dead, But was like me surpris'd by Cortugogly. Alber. I would I had dyed there. Pros. And from him learning Baptista liv'd, and their dissolved freindship, I hois'd up sailes for Greece, found Iuliana A votary at her beades; having made knowne Both that you liv'd, and where you were, she borrow'd So much from her devotion as to wish me To bring her to you; if the object please you, With joy receave her. Bapt. Rage and fury leave meâ throwes away his sword I am so full of happines, theres no room left To entertaine you, O my long lost Iewell, Light of mine eyes, my soules strength. Julia. My best Lord, having Embrac'd you thus, Death cannot fright me. Bapt. Live long to do so though J should fix here. Pardon me Prospero though I enquire my daughters fortune. Pros. That your happinesse May be at all parts perfect, here she is! CÃ¦s. Biancha daughter to a princesse. Pros. True with my faithfull Host I left her, And with him till now she hath resided, Ignorant both of her birth and greatnesse. Bap. O my blest one. Ioy upon joy over-whelmes me. Duke. Above wonder. Alb. I doe begin to melt too, this strange story Workes much upon me. Duke. Since it hath ples'd heaven To grace us with this miracle, I that am Heavens instrument here, determine thus; Alberto Be not unthankefull for the blessings showne you, Nor you Baptista; discord was yet never A welcome sacrifice; therefore rage layd by, Embrace as freinds, and let pass'd difference Be as a dreame forgotten. Bap. Tis to me. Alber. And me, and thus confirme it. Duke. And to tye it In bonds not to be broken, with the marriage Of young Mentivole, and faire Clarissa, So you consent great Lady, your Biancha Shall call CÃ¦sario Husband. Iulia. Tis a motion I gladly yeeld too. CÃ¦sar. One in which you make a sadd man happy. Offers to kneele. Bian. Kneele not, all forgiven. Duke. With the Duke your Vnkle I will make attonement, and will have no denyall. Enter Host, Forobosco, Clowne and Officers. Mar. Let this day be still held sacred. Host. Now if you can conjure, let the Divell unbind you, Foro. Wee are both undone, Clow. Already wee feele it. Host. Iustice sir, Duke. What are they? Pros. I can resolve you, slaves freed from the Gallyes By the Viceroy of Sicilia. Duke. Whats their offence? Host. The robbing me of all my plate and Iewels, I meane the attempting of it. Clow. Please your grace I will now discover this varlet in earnest, this honest pestilent rogue, profest the art of conjuring, but all the skill that ever he had in the black art was in making a seacole fire; only with wearing strange shapes he begot admiration amongst fooles and women. Foro. Wilt thou preach thou varlet? Duke. Why does he gogle with his eyes, and stauke so? Clow. This is one of his Magicall raptures. Foro. I doe vilifie your censure, you demand if I am guilty, whir sayes my cloake by a tricke of legerdemaine, now I am not guilty, I am guarded with innocence, pure silver lace I assure you. Clow. Thus have I read to you your vertues, which not withstanding I would not have you proud of. Foro. Out thou concealement of tallow, and counterfeit Mummia. Duke. To the Gallyes with them both. Clow. The onely sea physick for a knave ia to be basted in a gally with the oyle of a Bulls peesell. Foro. And will not you make a soure face at the same sauce, sirra? I hope to finde thee so leane, in one fortnight thou mayest be drawne by the cares through the hoop of a firkin. Duke. Divide them and away with them them to'th Gallyes. Clow. This will take downe your pride Iugler. Duke. This day that hath given birth to blessings; beyond hope, admits no criminall sentence, to the Temple and there with humblenesse praise heavens bounties; For blessings here discend from thence, but when A sacrifice, in thankes ascends from men. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
