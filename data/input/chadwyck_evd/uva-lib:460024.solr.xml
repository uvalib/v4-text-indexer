      <field name="fulltext">THE Distrest Mother. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Her GRACE THE Dutchess of Montague.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Written by Mr. STEELE. Spoken by Mr. WILKS. Since Fancy of it self is loose and vain, The wise by Rules, that airy Power restrain; They think those Writers mad, who at their Ease Convey this House and Audience where they please; Who Nature's stated Distances confound, And make this Spot all Soils the Sun goes round: 'Tis nothing, when a fancy'd Scene's in view, To skip from Covent-Garden to Peru. But Shakespear's self transgress'd; and shall each Elf, Each Pigmy Genius, quote Great Shakespear's self! What Critick dares prescribe what's just and fit, Or mark out Limits for such boundless Wit! Shakespear could travel thro' Earth, Sea and Air, And paint out all the Powers and Wonders there. In barren Desarts he makes Nature smile, And gives us Feasts in his Enchanted Isle. Our Author does his feeble Force confess, Nor dares pretend such Merit to transgress; Does not such shining Gifts of Genius share, And therefore makes Propriety his Care. Your Treat with study'd Decency he serves; Not only Rules of Time and Place preserves, But strives to keep his Characters intire, With French Correctness and with British Fire. This Piece presented in a Foreign Tongue, When France was Glorious, and her Monarch young, A hundred times a crowded Audience drew; A hundred times repeated, still 'twas new. Pyrrhus provok'd, to no wild Rants betray'd, Resents his generous Love so ill repay'd; Does like a Man resent, a Prince upbraid. His Sentiments confess a Royal Mind, Nor is he known a King from Guards behind. Injur'd Hermonie demands Relief; But not from heavy Narratives of Grief: In conscious Majesty her Pride is shewn; Born to avenge her Wrongs, but not bemoan. AndromacheâIf in our Author's Lines, As in the great Original, she shines, Nothing but from Barbarity she fears. Attend with Silence; you'll applaud with Tears.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Orestes and Pylades. Orestes. O Pylades! What's Life without a Friend! At Sight of thee my gloomy Soul clears up; My Hopes revive, and Gladness dawns within me. After an Absence of six tedious Moons, How could I hope to find my Pylades; My Joy, my Comfort! on this fatal Shore? Even in the Court of Pyrrhus? in these Realms, These hated Realms, so cross to all my Wishes. Oh, my brave Friend! may no blind Stroke of Fate Divide us more, and tear me from my self. Pyl. O Prince! O, my Orestes! O, my Friendâ! Thus let me speak the Welcome of my Heart. [Embracing. Since I have gain'd this unexpected Meeting, Blest be the Powers, who barr'd my Way to Greece, And kept me here! e'er since th'unhappy Day, When warring Winds (Epirus full in View) Sunder'd our Barks on the loud, stormy Main. Orest. It was, indeed, a Morning full of Horror! Pyl. A Thousand boading Cares have rack'd my Soul In your behalf. Often, with Tears, I mourn'd The fatal Ills, in which your Life's involv'd; And grudg'd you Dangers, which I could not share. I fear'd, to what Extreams the black Despair, That prey'd upon your Mind, might have betray'd you; And lest the Gods, in Pity to your Woes, Should hear your Pray'rs, and take the Life you loath'd. But now with Joy I see you!âThe Retinue And numerous Followers, that surround you here, Speak better Fortunes, and a Mind dispos'd To relish Life. Orest. Alas! my Friend, who knows The Destiny, to which I stand reserv'd! I come in search of an inhuman Fair; And live or dye, as she decrees my Fate. Pyl. You much surprize me, Prince!âI thought you cur'd Of your unpity'd, unsuccessful Passion. Why, in Epirus, shou'd you hope to find Hermione less cruel, than at Sparta? I thought her Pride, and the disdainful manner, In which she treated all your constant Suff'rings, Had broke your Fetters, and assur'd your Freedom: Asham'd of your Repulse, and slighted Vows, You hated her; you talk'd of her no more. Prince you deceiv'd me. Orest. I deceiv'd my self. Do not upbraid the Unhappy Man, that loves thee. Thou know'st, I never hid my Passion from thee: Thou saw'st it in its Birth, and in its Progress. And when at last the hoary King, her Father, Great Menelaus, gave away his Daughter, His lovely Daughter, to this happy Pyrrhus, The Avenger of his Wrongs; thou saw'st my Grief, My Torture, my Despair; and how I dragg'd, From Sea to Sea, a heavy Chain of Woes. O, Pylades! my Heart has bled within me, To see thee, prest with Sorrows not thy own, Still wandring with me, like a banish'd Man; Watchful, and anxious for thy wretched Friend, To temper the wild Transports of my Mind, And save me from my self. Pyl. Why thus unkind? Why will you envy me the pleasing Tasks Of generous Love and sympathizing Friendship? Orest. Thou Miracle of Truth!âBut hear me on. When, in the midst of my disastrous Fate, I thought, how the Divine Hermione, Deaf to my Vows, regardless of my Plaints, Gave up her self, in all her Charms, to Pyrrhus; Thou may'st remember, I abhorr'd her Name, Strove to forget her, and repay her Scorn I made my Friends, and even my self, believe My Soul was freed. Alas! I did not see, That all the Malice of my Heart was Love. Triumphing thus, and yet a Captive still, In Greece I landed: And in Greece I found The assembled Princes all alarm'd with Fears, In which their common Safety seem'd concern'd. I join'd them: For I hoped that War and Glory Might fill my Mind, and take up all my Thoughts; And, that my shatter'd Soul, impair'd with Grief, Once more would reassume its wanted Vigour, And ev'ry idle Passion quit my Breast. Pyl. The Thought was worthy Agamemnon's Son. Orest. But see the strange Perverseness of my Stars, Which throws me on the Rock I strove to shun! The jealous Chiefs, and all the States of Greece, With one united Voice, complain of Pyrrhus; That now, forgetful of the Promise given, And mindless of his Godlike Father's Fate, Astyanax he nurses in his Court; Astyanax, the Young, surviving Hope Of ruin'd Troy; Astyanax, descended From a long Race of Kings; great Hector's Son. Pyl. A Name still dreadful in the Ears of Greece! But, Prince, you'll cease to wonder, why the Child Lives thus protected in the Court of Pyrrhus, When you shall hear, the bright Andromache, His lovely Captive, charms him from his Purpose: The Mother's Beauty guards the helpless Son. Orest. Your Tale confirms what I have heard; and hence Springs all my Hopes. Since my proud Rival woes Another Partner to his Throne and Bed, Hermione may still be mine. Her Father, The injur'd Menelaus, thinks already His Daughter slighted, and the intended Nuptials Too long delay'd. I heard his loud Complaints With secret Pleasure; and was glad to find The ungrateful Maid neglected in her Turn, And all my Wrongs avenged in her Disgrace. Pyl. Oh, may you keep your just Resentments warm! Orest. Resentments? Ah, my Friend, too soon I found They grew not out of Hatred! I am betray'd: I practise on my self; and fondly plot My own Undoing. Goaded on by Love, I canvass'd all the Suffrages of Greece; And here I come, their sworn Ambassador, To speak their Jealousies, and claim this Boy. Pyl. Pyrrhus will treat your Embassy with Scorn. Full of Achilles, his redoubted Sire, Pyrrhus is proud, impetuous, headstrong, fierce; Made up of Passions: Will he then be sway'd, And give to Death the Son of her he loves? Orst. Oh, would he render up Hermione, And keep Astyanax; I should be blest! He must; he shall: Hermione is my Life, My Soul, my Rapture!âI'll no longer curb The strong Desire, that hurries me to Madness: I'll give a Loose to Love; I'll bear her hence; I'll tear her from his Arms; I'llâO, ye Gods! Give me Hermione; or let me die!â But, tell me, Pylades; how stand my Hopes? Is Pyrrhus still enamour'd with her Charms? Or do'st thou think, he'll yield me up the Prize, The dear, dear Prize, which he has ravish'd from me! Pyl. I dare not flatter your fond Hopes so far. The King, indeed, cold to the Spartan Princess, Turns all his Passion to Andromache, Hector's afflicted Widow. But in vain, With inter-woven Love and Rage, he sues The charming Captive, obstinately cruel. Oft he alarms her for her Child, confin'd Apart; and, when her Tears begin to flow, As soon he stops them, and recalls his Threats. Hermione a thousand times has seen His ill-requited Vows return to her; And takes his Indignation all for Love. What can be gather'd from a Man so various? He may, in the Disorder of his Soul, Wed her, he hates; and punish her, he loves. Orest. But, tell me, how the wrong'd Hermione Brooks her slow Nuptials, and dishonour'd Charms? Pyl. Hermione would fain be thought to scorn Her wavering Lover, and disdain his Falshood; But, spight of all her Pride, and conscious Beauty, She mourns in Secret her neglected Charms; And oft has made me privy to her Tears: Still threatens to be gone; yet still she stays; And sometimes sighs, and wishes for Orestes. Orest. Ah, were those Wishes from her Heart, my Friend, I'd fly in Transportâ [Flourish within. Pyl. Hear!âThe King approaches To give you Audience. Speak your Embassy Without Reserve: Urge the Demands of Greece; And in the Name of all her Kings require, That Hector's Son be given into your Hands. Pyrrhus, instead of granting what they ask, To speed his Love, and win the Trojan Dame, Will make it Merit to preserve her Son. But, see; he comes! Orest. Mean while, my Pylades, Go, and dispose Hermione to see Her Lover, who is come thus far, to throw Himself in all his Sorrows at her Feet. SCENE II. Orestes, Pyrrhus, and PhÃ¦nix. Orest. Before I speak the Message of the Greeks, Permit me, Sir, to glory in the Title Of their Ambassador; since I behold Troy's Vanquisher, and Great Achilles Son. Nor does the Son rise short of such a Father: If Hector fell by him, Troy fell by you But, what your Father never would have done, You do. You cherish the Remains of Troy; And, by an ill timed Pity, keep alive The dying Embers of a Ten-years War. Have you so soon forgot the mighty Hector? The Greeks remember his high-brandish'd Sword, That fill'd their States with Widows and with Orphans; For which they call for Vengeance on his Son. Who knows what he may one Day prove? Who knows But he may brave us in our Ports; and, fill'd With Hector's Fury, set our Fleets on blaze? You may, your self, live to repent your Mercy. Comply, then, with the Grecians just Demands: Satiate their Vengeance, and preserve your self. Pyr. The Greeks are for my Safety more concern'd Than I desire. I thought your Kings were met On more Important Councils. When I heard The Name of their Ambassador, I hoped Some glorious Enterprize was taking Birth. Is Agamemnon's Son dispatch'd for this? And do the Grecian Chiefs, renown'd in War, A Race of Heroes, join in close Debate, To plot an Infant's Death?âWhat Right has Greece To ask his Life? Must I, must I alone, Of all her scepter'd Warriors, be deny'd To treat my Captive as I please? Know, Prince, When Troy lay smoaking on the Ground, and each Proud Victor shared the Harvest of the War; Andromache and this her Son were mine; Were mine by Lot: And who shall wrest them from me? Ulysses bore away old Priam's Queen; Cassandra was your own great Father's Prize: Did I concern my self in what they won? Did I send Embassies to claim their Captives? Orest. But, Sir, we fear, for you and for our selves, Troy may again revive, and a new Hector Rise in Astyanax. Then think betimesâ Pyr. Let dastard Souls be timorously wise: But tell them, Pyrrhus knows not how to form Far-fancy'd Ills, and Dangers out of sight. Orest. Sir, call to mind the unrivall'd Strength of Troy; Her Walls, her Bulwarks, and her Gates of Brass; Her Kings, her Heroes, and embattel'd Armies! Pyr. I call them all to mind; and see them all Confus'd in Dust; all mixt in one wide Ruin; All but a Child, and he in Bondage held. What Vengeance can we fear from such a Troy? If they have sworn to extinguish Hector's Race, Why was their Vow for twelve long Months deferr'd? Why was he not in Priam's Bosom slain? He should have fallen among the slaughter'd Heaps, Whelm'd under Troy. His Death had then been just, When Age and Infancy, alike in vain, Pleaded their Weakness; when the heat of Conquest, And Horrours of the Night, rouz'd all our Rage, And blindly hurry'd us through Scenes of Death. My Fury then was without Bounds: But now, My Wrath appeas'd, must I be cruel still? And, deaf to all the tender Calls of Pity, Like a cool Murderer, bath my Hands in Blood? An Infant's Blood?âNo, PrinceâGo, bid the Greeks Mark out some other Victim; my Revenge Has had its Fill. What has escaped from Troy Shall not be saved to perish in Epirus. Orest. I need not tell you, Sir, Astyanax Was doom'd to Death in Troy; nor how The crafty Mother saved her darling Son. The Greeks do now but urge their former Sentence: Nor is't the Boy, but Hector they pursue; The Father draws their Vengeance on the Son: The Father, who so oft in Grecian Blood Has drench'd his Sword: The Father, whom the Greeks May seek even here.âPrevent them, Sir, in time. Pyr. No! Let them come; since I was born to wage Eternal Wars. Let them now turn their Arms On him, who conquer'd for them: Let them come, And in Epirus seek another Troy. 'Twas thus they recompens'd my God-like Sire; Thus was Achilles thank'd: But, Prince, remember, Their black Ingratitude then cost them dear. Orest. Shall Greece then find a Rebel Son in Pyrrhus? Pyr. Have I then conquer'd to depend on Greece? Orest. Hermione will sway your Soul to Peace, And mediate 'twixt her Father and your self: Her Beauty will enforce my Embassie. Pyr. Hermione may have her Charms; and I May love her still, tho' not her Father's Slave. I may in time give Proofs, that I am a Lover; But never must forget, that I am a King. Mean while, Sir, you may see fair Helen's Daughter: I know how near in Blood you stand ally'd. That done, you have my Answer, Prince. The Greeks No doubt expect your quick Return. SCENE III. Pyrrhus and PhÅnix. PhÅn. Sir, do you send your Rival to the Princess? Pyr. I am told, that he has lov'd her long. PhÅn. If so, Have you not cause to fear the smother'd Flame May kindle at her Sight, and blaze anew? And she be wrought to listen to his Passion? Pyr. Ah, let them, PhÅnix; let them love their Fill! Let them go hence; let them depart together; Together let them sail for Sparta: All my Ports Are open to them both. From what Constraint, What irksome Thoughts should I be then reliev'd! PhÅn. But, Sirâ Pyr. I shall another time, good PhÅnix, Unbosom to thee all my Thoughts.âFor, see, Andromache appears. SCENE IV. Pyrrhus, Andromache and Cephisa. Pyr. May I, Madam, Flatter my Hopes so far, as to believe You come to seek me here? Andr. This way, Sir, leads To those Apartments, where you guard my Son. Since you permit me, once a Day, to visit All I have left of Hector, and of Troy; I go to weep a few sad Moments with him. I have not yet, to Day, embraced my Child; I have not held him in my widow'd Arms. Pyr. Ah, Madam! should the Threats of Greece prevail, You'll have Occasion for your Tears, indeed! Andr. Alas! what Threats? What can alarm the Greeks? There are no Trojans left! Pyr. Their Hate to Hector Can never die: The Terrour of his Name Still shakes their Souls; and makes them dread his Son. Andr. A mighty Honour for victorious Greece To fear an Infant; a poor, friendless Child! Who smiles in Bondage; nor yet knows himself The Son of Hector, and the Slave of Pyrrhus. Pyr. Weak as he is, the Greeks demand his Life; And send no less than Agamemnon's Son, To fetch him hence. Andr. And, Sir, do you comply With such Demands!âThis Blow is aim'd at me: How should the Child avenge his slaughter'd Sire? But, cruel Men! they will not have him live To chear my heavy Heart, and ease my Bonds. I promis'd to my self in him a Son, In him a Friend, a Husband, and a Father. But I must suffer Sorrow heap'd on Sorrow; And still the fatal Stroke must come from you. Pyr. Dry up those Tears: I must not see you weep: And know, I have rejected their Demands. The Greeks already threaten me with War: But, should they arm, as once they did for Helen, And hide the Adriatick with their Fleets; Should they prepare a second ten Years Siege, And lay my Towers and Palaces in Dust: I am determin'd to defend your Son; And rather die my self, than give him up. But, Madam, in the midst of all these Dangers, Will you refuse me a propitious Smile? Hated of Greece, and prest on every side, Let me not, Madam, while I fight your Cause, Let me not combat with your Cruelties; And count Andromache amongst my Foes. Andr. Consider, Sir, how this will sound in Greece! How can so great a Soul betray such Weakness? Let not Men say, so generous a Design Was but the Transport of a Heart in Love. Pyr. Your Charms will justifie me to the World. Andr. How can Andromache, a Captive Queen, O'er-whelm'd with Grief, a Burden to her self, Harbour a Thought of Love? Alas! what Charms Have these unhappy Eyes, by you condemn'd To weep for ever?âTalk of it no more.â To reverence the Misfortunes of a Foe; To succour the Distrest; to give the Son To an afflicted Mother; to repel Confederate Nations, leagued against his Life; Unbribed by Love, unterrify'd by Threats, To pity, to protect him: These are Cares, These are Exploits worthy Achilles' Son. Pyr. Will your Resentments, then, endure for ever? Must Pyrrhus never be forgiven?â'Tis true, My Sword has often reek'd in Phrygian Blood, And carry'd Havock through your Royal Kindred: But you, fair Princess, amply have avenged Old Priam's vanquish'd House: And all the Woes, I brought on them, fall short of what I suffer. We both have suffer'd in our Turns: And now Our common Foes should teach us to unite. Andr. Where does the Captive not behold a Foe? Pyr. Forget that Term of Hatred; and behold A Friend in Pyrrhus! Give me but to hope, I'll free your Son; I'll be a Father to him: My self will teach him to avenge the Trojans. I'll go in Person to chastise the Greeks, Both for your Wrongs and mine. Inspired by you, What would I not atchieve? Again shall Troy Rise from its Ashes: This right Arm shall fix Her Seat of Empire; and your Son shall reign. Andr. Such Deams of Greatness suit not my Condition: His Hopes of Empire perish'd with his Father. No; thou imperial City, ancient Troy, Thou Pride of Asia, founded by the Gods; Never, oh never! must we hope to see Those Bulwarks rise, which Hector could not guard!â Sir, all I wish for, is some quiet Exile; Where far from Greece remov'd, and far from you, I may conceal my Son, and mourn my Husband. Your Love creates me Envy. Oh, return! Return to your betroth'd Hermione. Pyr. Why do you mock me thus? you know, I cannot. You know my Heart is yours: My Soul hangs on you: You take up every Wish: My waking Thoughts, And nightly Dreams are all employ'd on you. 'Tis true, Hermione was sent to share My Throne and Bed, and would with Transport hear The Vows, which you neglect. Andr. She has no Troy, No Hector to lament: She has not lost A Husband by your Conquests: Such a Husband! (Tormenting Thought!) whose Death alone has made Your Sire immortal: Pyrrhus and Achilles Are both grown great by my Calamities. Pyr. Madam, 'tis well! 'Tis very well! I find, Your Will must be obey'd: Imperious Captive, It shall. Henceforth I blot you from my Mind: You teach me to forget your Charms; to hate you. For, know, inhuman Beauty, I have loved Too well to treat you with Indifference. Think well upon it: My disorder'd Soul Wavers between th'Extremes of Love and Rage. I've been too tame! I will awake to Vengeance! The Son shall answer for the Mother's Scorn. The Greeks demand him: Nor will I endanger My Realms, to pleasure an ungrateful Woman. Andr. Then he must die! alas, my Son must die! He has no Friend, no Succour left, besides His Mother's Tears, and his own Innocence. Pyr. Go, Madam; visit this unhappy Son. The Sight of him may bend your stubborn Heart, And turn to Softness your unjust Disdain. I shall once more expect your Answer. Go; And think, while you embrace the Captive Boy, Think, that his Life depends on your Resolves. SCENE V. Andromache and Cephisa. Andr. I'll go, and, in the Anguish of my Heart, Weep o'er my ChildâIf he must dye, my Life Is wrapt in his; I shall not long survive. 'Tis for his sake, that I have suffer'd Life; Groan'd in Captivity; and out-liv'd Hector. Yes, my Astyanax; we'll go together! Together to the Realms of Night we'll go! There to thy ravish'd Eyes thy Sire I'll show, And point him out among the Shades below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Hermione and Cleone. Her. Well, I'll be rul'd, Cleone: I will see him; I have told Pylades, that he may bring him. But, trust me, were I left to my own Thoughts, I should forbid him yet. Cle. And why forbid him? Is he not, Madam, still the same Orestes? Orestes, whose Return you oft have wish'd? The Man, whose Sufferings you so oft lamented, And often prais'd his Constancy and Love? Her. That Love, that Constancy, so ill requited, Upbraids me to my self: I blush to think, How I have us'd him; and would shun his Presence. What will be my Confusion, when he sees me Neglected, and forsaken, like himself? Will he not say, Is this the scornful Maid; The proud Hermione, that tyranniz'd In Sparta's Court? And triumph'd in her Charms? Her Insolence at last is well repaid. I cannot bear the Thought. Cle. You wrong your self With unbecoming Fears. He knows too well Your Beauty and your Worth. Your Lover comes not To offer Insults; but repeat his Vows, And breath his ardent Passion at your Feet. But, Madam, what's your Royal Father's Will? What Orders do your Letters bring from Sparta? Her. His Orders are, if Pyrrhus still delay The Nuptials, and refuse to Sacrifice This Trojan Boy; I should with speed embark, And with their Embassy return to Greece. Cle. What would you more? Orestes comes in time To save your Honour. Pyrrhus cools apace: Prevent his Falshood; and forsake him first. I know you hate him: You have told me so. Her. Hate him? My injur'd Honour bids me hate him: The ungrateful Man! to whom I fondly gave My Virgin Heart; the Man I loved so dearly; The Man, I doated on! Oh, my Cleone! How is it possible I should not hate him? Cle. Then give him over, Madam. Quit his Court; And with Orestesâ Her. No! I must have time To work up all my Rage! To meditate A Parting, full of Horrour! My Revenge Will be but too much quicken'd by the Traitour. Cle. Do you then wait new Insults? New Affronts? To draw you from your Father! Then to leave you! In his own Court to leave you,âfor a Captive! If Pyrrhus can provoke you, he has done it. Her. Why dost thou heighten my Distress? I fear To search out my own Thoughts, and sound my Heart. Be blind to what thou seest: Believe me cured: Flatter my Weakness; tell me I have conquer'd: Think, that my injur'd Soul is set against him And do thy best to make me think so too. Cleo. Why would you loiter here, then? Her. Let us fly! Let us be gone! I leave him to his Captive Let him go kneel and supplicate his Slave. Let us be gone!âBut, what if he repent? What, if the perjur'd Prince again submit, And sue for Pardon? What, if he renew His former Vows?âBut, oh the faithless Man! He slights me! drives me to Extreams!âHowever, I'll stay, Cleone, to perplex their Loves: I'll stay, till, by an open Breach of Contract, I make him hateful to the Greeks. Already Their Vengeance have I drawn upon the Son: Their second Embassy shall claim the Mother: I will redouble all my Griefs upon her! Cle. Ah, Madam, whither does your Rage transport you? Andromache, alas, is Innocent! A Woman plung'd in Sorrow; dead to Love: And, when she thinks of Pyrrhus, 'tis with Horrour. Her. Would I had done so too!âHe had not, then, Betray'd my easie Faith.âBut I, alas! Discover'd all the Fondness of my Soul; I made no Secret of my Passion to him: Nor thought it dangerous to be sincere. My Eyes, my Tongue, my Actions spoke my Heart. Cle. Well might you speak, without Reserve, to one Engag'd to you by solemn Oaths and Treaties. Her. His Ardour too was an Excuse to mine: With other Eyes he saw me then!âCleone, Thou may'st remember, everything conspired To favour him: My Father's Wrongs avenged; The Greeks triumphant; Fleets of Trojan Spoils; His mighty Sire's, his own Immortal Fame; His eager Love;âAll, all conspired against me! âBut I have done:âI'll think no more of Pyrrhus. Orestes wants not Merit: And he loves me. My Gratitude, my Honour, both plead for him: And, if I've Power o'er my own Heart, 'tis his. Cle. Madam, he comesâ Her. Alas! I did not think He was so near!âI wish I might not see him! SCENE II. Hermione, Cleone, and Orestes. Her. How am I to interpret, Sir, this Visit? Is it a Compliment of Form, or Love? Orest. Madam, you know my Weakness. 'Tis my Fate To Love, unpity'd: To desire to see you; And still to swear each time shall be the last. My Passion breaks through my repeated Oaths; And every time I visit you, I am perjur'd. Even now, I find my Wounds all bleed afresh: I blush to own it; but I know no Cure. I call the Gods to Witness, I have try'd Whatever Man could do, (but try'd in vain) To wear you from my Mind. Through stormy Seas, And savage Climes, in a whole Year of Absence, I courted Dangers, and I long'd for Death, Her. Why will you, Prince, indulge this mournful Tale? It ill becomes the Ambassadour of Greece To talk of Dying, and of Love. Remember The Kings you represent: Shall their Revenge Be disappointed by your ill-timed Passion? Discharge your Embassy: 'Tis not Orestes The Greeks desire should dye. Orest. My Embassy Is at an End: For Pyrrhus has refused To give up Hector's Son. Some hidden Power Protects the Boy. Her. Faithless, ungrateful Man! [Aside. Orest. I now prepare for Greece. But, ere I go, Would hear my final Doom pronounc'd by you. What do I say?âI do already hear it! My Doom is fixt: I read it in your Eyes. Her. Will you then still despair? Be still suspicious? What have I done? Wherein have I been cruel? 'Tis true, you find me in the Court of Pyrrhus: But, 'twas my Royal Father sent me hither. And who can tell, but I have shared your Griefs? Have I ne'er wept in secret? Never wish'd To see Orestes?â Orest. Wish'd to see Orestes!â Oh Joy! Oh Extasie! My Soul's intranced! Oh charming Princess! Oh transcendent Maid! My utmost Wish!âThus, thus let me express My boundless Thanks!âI never was unhappy.â Am I Orestes?â Her. You are Orestes: The same unalter'd, generous, faithful Lover; The Prince, whom I esteem; whom I lament; And whom I fain would teach my Heart to love! Orest. Ay, there it is!âI have but your Esteem; While Pyrrhus has your Heart!â Her. Believe me, Prince, Were you as Pyrrhus, I should hate you!â Orest. No!â I should be blest! I should be lov'd as he is!â Yet all this while I dye by your Disdain; While he neglects your Charms, and courts another. Her. And who has told you, Prince, that I am neglected? Has Pyrrhus saidâ(Oh, I shall grow distracted!) Has Pyrrhus told you so?âOr is it you, Who think thus meanly of me?âSir, perhaps, All do not judge like you.â Orest. Madam, go on! Insult me still: I am us'd to bear your Scorn. Her. Why am I told how Pyrrhus loves or hates? âGo, Prince, and arm the Greeks against the Rebel: Let them lay waste his Country; raze his Towns; Destroy his Fleets; his Palaces;âHimself!â Go, Prince; and tell me then how much I love him. Orest. To hasten his Destruction, come your self; And work your Royal Father to his Ruin. Her. Mean while he weds Andromache! Orest. Ah, Princess! What is't I hear? Her. What Infamy for Greece, If he shou'd wed a Phrygian, and a Captive! Orest. Is this your Hatred, Madam?â'Tis in vain You hide your Passion; every Thing betrays it: Your Looks, your Speech, your Anger, nay your Silence; Your Love appears in All; your secret Flame Breaks out the more, the more you would conceal it. Her. Your Jealousie perverts my Meaning still, And wrests each Circumstance to your Disquiet: My very Hate is construed into Fondness. Orest. Impute my Fears, if groundless, to my Love. Her. Then hear me, Prince. Obedience to a Father First brought me hither; and the same Obedience Detains me here, 'till Pyrrhus drive me hence; Or my offended Father shall recall me. Tell this proud King, that MenelaÃ¼s scorns To match his Daughter with a Foe of Greece: Bid him resign Astyanax, or me. If he persists to guard the hostile Boy, Hermione embarks with you for Sparta. SCENE III. Orestes , alone. Then is Orestes blest! My Griefs are fled! Fled like a Dream!âMethinks I tread in Air! Pyrrhus, enamour'd of his Captive Queen, Will thank me, if I take her Rival hence: He looks not on the Princess with my Eyes! Surprizing Happiness! unlook'd-for Joy! Never let Love despair!âThe Prize is mine! Be smooth, ye Seas; and, ye propitious Winds, Breathe from Epirus to the Spartan Coasts! I long to view the Sails unfurl'dâBut, see! Pyrrhus approaches in a happy Hour. SCENE IV. Orestes, Pyrrhus and PhÅnix. Pyr. I was in Pain to find you, Prince. My warm, Ungovern'd Temper would not let me weigh The Importance of your Embassy; and hear You argue for my Good.âI was to blame. I since have poised your Reasons: And I thank My good Allies: Their Care deserves my Thanks. You have convinced me, that the Weal of Greece, My Father's Honour, and my own Repose Demand, that Hector's Race should be destroy'd. I shall deliver up Astyanax; And you, your self, shall bear the Victim hence. Orest. If you approve it, Sir, and are content To spill the Blood of a defenceless Child; The offended Greeks, no doubt, will be appeas'd. Pyr. Closer to strain the Knot of our Alliance, I have determin'd to espouse Hermione. You come in time to grace our Nuptial Rites: In you the Kings of Greece will all be present; And you have Right to personate her Father, As his Ambassadour and Brother's Son. Go, Prince, renew your Visit; tell Hermione, To-Morrow I receive her from your Hands. Orest. [aside.] O Change of Fortune! Oh undone Orestes! SCENE V. Pyrrhus and PhÅnix. Pyr. Well, PhÅnix! Am I still a Slave to Love? What thinkest thou now? Am I my self again? PhÅn. Sir, This is something; this discovers Pyrrhus; Shews all the Hero: Now you are your self! The Son! the Rival of the great Achilles! Greece will applaud you; and the World confess, Pyrrhus has conquer'd Troy a second Time! Pyr. Nay, PhÅnix, now I but begin to triumph: I never was a Conquerour 'till now! Believe me, a whole Host, a War of Foes May sooner be subdued, than Love. O, PhÅnix! What Ruin have I shunn'd? The Greeks, enraged, Hung o'er me, like a gathering Storm; and soon Had burst in Thunder on my Head; while I Abandon'd Duty, Empire, Honour, All, To please a thankless Woman!âOne kind Look Had quite undone me! PhÅn. O, my Royal Master! The Gods, in Favour to you, made her cruel. Pyr. Thou sawest with how much Scorn she treated me! When I permitted her to see her Son, I hoped it might have work'd her to my Wishes. I went to see the mournful Interview, And found her bathed in Tears, and lost in Passion. Wild with Distress, a Thousand Times she call'd On Hector's Name: And when I spoke in Comfort, And promis'd my Protection to her Son; She kiss'd the Boy; and call'd again on Hector: Then strain'd him in her Arms; and cry'd, 'Tis he! 'Tis he himself! his Eyes, his every Feature! His very Frown, and his stern Look already! 'Tis he! 'Tis my loved Lord, whom I embrace!â Does she then think, that I preserve the Boy, To sooth and keep alive her Flame for Hector? PhÅn. No doubt, she does; and thinks you favour'd in it. But let her go, for an ungrateful Woman! Pyr. I know the Thoughts of her proud, stubborn Heart: Vain of her Charms, and insolent in Beauty, She mocks my Rage; and, when it threatens loudest, Expects, 'twill soon be humbled into Love. But we shall change our Parts: And she shall find, I can be deaf, like her; and steel my Heart! She is Hector's Widow; I Achilles' Son: Pyrrhus is born to hate Andromache! PhÅn. My Royal Master, talk of her no more: I do not like this Anger. Your Hermione Should now engross your Thoughts. 'Tis time to see her: 'Tis time, you should prepare the Nuptial Rites; And not relye upon a Rival's Care: It may be dangerous. Pyr. But tell me, PhÅnix; Doest thou not think, the proud Andromache Will be enraged, when I shall wed the Princess? PhÅn. Why does Andromache still haunt your Thoughts? What is't to you, be she enraged or pleas'd? Let her Name perish: Think of her no more! Pyr. No, PhÅnix!âI have been too gentle with her: I have check'd my Wrath, and stifled my Resentments: She knows not yet to what degree I hate her. Let us return:âI'll brave her to her Face: I'll give my Anger it's free Course against her. Thou shalt see, PhÅnix, how I'll break her Pride! PhÅn. Oh, go not, Sir!âThere's Ruin in her Eyes! You do not know your Strength: You'll fall before her, Adore her Beauty, and revive her Scorn. Pyr. That were indeed a most unmanly Weakness! Thou dost not know me, PhÅnix! PhÅn. Ah, my Prince! You still are strugling in the Toils of Love. Pyr. Can'st thou then think, I love this Woman still? One who repays my Passion with Disdain! A Stranger, Captive, friendless and forlorn; She and her darling Son within my Power; His Life a Forfeit to the Greeks: Yet I Preserve her Son; would take her to my Throne; Would fight her Battels, and avenge her Wrongs; And all this while she treats me as her Foe! PhÅn. You have it in your Power to be revenged. Pyr. Yes;âand I'll shew my Power!âI'll give her Cause To hate me! her Astyanax shall die!â What Tears will then be shed! How will she then In bitterness of Heart reproach my Name! Then, to compleat her Woes, will I espouse Hermione:â'Twill stab her to the Heart! PhÅn. Alas, you threaten, like a Lover, still! Pyr. PhÅnix, excuse this Struggle of my Soul: 'Tis the last Effort of expiring Love. PhÅn. Then hasten, Sir, to see the Spartan Princess; And turn the Bent of your Desires on her. Pyr. Oh, 'tis a heavy Task to conquer Love! And wean the Soul from her accustom'd Fondness. But, come:âA long Farewel to Hector's Widow. 'Tis with a secret Pleasure I look back, And see the many Dangers I have pass'd. The Merchant thus, in dreadful Tempests tost, Thrown by the Waves on some unlook'd-for Coast; Oft turns, and sees, with a delighted Eye, 'Midst Rocks and Shelves the broken Billows fly: And, while the outragious Winds the Deep deform, Smiles on the Tumult, and enjoys the Storm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Pylades and Orestes. Pyl. For Heaven's sake, Sir, compose your ruffled Mind, And moderate your Rage! Orest. No, Pylades! This is no time for Counsel.âI am deaf. Talk not of Reason! I have been too patient. Life is not worth my Care. My Soul grows desperate. I'll bear her off; or perish in the Attempt. I'll force her from his Arms:âBy Heaven, I will! Pyl. Well; 'tis agreed, my Friend:âWe'll force her hence. But still consider we are in Epirus: The Court, the Guards, Hermione her self, The very Air we breath, belongs to Pyrrhus. Good Gods! what tempted you to seek her here? Orest. Lost to my self, I knew not what I did! My Purposes were wild. Perhaps I came To menace Pyrrhus, and upbraid this Woman. Pyl. This Violence of Temper may prove fatal. Orest. I must be more than Man to bear these Shocks, These Outrages of Fate, with Temper! He tells me, that he weds Hermione; And will to-Morrow take her from my Hand!â My Hand shall sooner tear the Tyrant's Heartâ Pyl. Your Passion blinds you, Sir:âHe's not to blame. Could you but look into the Soul of Pyrrhus, Perhaps you'd find it tortur'd, like your own. Orest. No, Pylades! 'Tis all Design.âHis Pride, To triumph over me, has chang'd I came, In all her Bloom of Beauty, was neglected. Ah cruel Gods! I thought her all my own! She was consenting to return to Sparta: Her Heart, divided betwixt Rage and Love, Was on the Wing to take its Leave of Pyrrhus. She heard my Sighs; she pityed my Complaints; She praised my Constancy:âThe least Indifference From this proud King, had made Orestes happy! Pyl. So your fond Heart believes!â Orest. Did I not see Her Hate, her Rage, her Indignation rise Against the ungrateful Man? Pyl. Believe me, Prince, 'Twas then she loved him most! Had Pyrrhus left her, She would have formed some new Pretext to stay. Take my Advice:âThink not to force her hence; But fly your self from her destructive Charms. Her Soul is linked to Pyrrhus. Were she yours, She would reproach you still, and still regret Her disappointed Nuptialsâ Orest. Talk no more! I cannot bear the Thought! She must be mine! Did Pyrrhus carry Thunder in his Hand, I'd stand the Bolt, and challenge all his Fury, Ere I resigned Hermione.âBy Force I'll snatch her hence, and bear her to my Ships! Have we forgot her Mother Helen's Rape? Pyl. Will then Orestes turn a Ravisher; And blot his Embassy? Orest. O, Pylades! My Grief weighs heavy on me:â'Twill distract me! O leave me to my self!âLet not thy Friendship Involve thee in my Woes. Too long already, Too long hast thou been punish'd for my Crimes. It is enough, my Friend!âIt is enough! Let not thy generous Love betray thee farther. The Gods have set me as their Mark, to empty Their Quivers on me.âLeave me to my self. Mine be the Danger; mine the Enterprize. All I request of thee is, to return, And in my Place convey Astyanax (As Pyrrhus has consented) into Greece. Go, Pyladesâ Pyl. Lead on, my Friend, lead on! Let us bear off Hermione! No Toil, No Danger can deter a Friend!âLead on! Draw up the Greeks: Summon your numerous Train, The Ships are ready; and the Wind sits fair: There Eastward lies the Sea; the rolling Waves Break on those Palace-stairs. I know each Pass, Each Avenue and Out-let of the Court. This very Night we'll carry her on Board. Orest. Thou art too good!âI trespass on thy Friendship: But oh, excuse a Wretch, whom no Man pities, Except thy self; one just about to lose The Treasure of his Soul: Whom all Mankind Conspire to hate; and one, who hates himself. When will my Friendship be of use to thee? Pyl. The Question is unkind.âBut now remember To keep your Counsels close, and hide your Thoughts: Let not Hermione suspectâNo moreâ I see her coming, Sirâ Orest. Away, my Friend: I am advised: my All depends upon it. SCENE II. Orestes, Hermione, and Cleone. Orest. Madam, your Orders are obey'd: I have seen Pyrrhus, my Rival; and have gained him for you. The King resolves to wed you. Her. So I am told; And farther, I am informed, that you, Orestes, Are to dispose me for the intended Marriage. Orest. And are you, Madam, willing to comply? Her. Could I imagine Pyrrhus loved me still? After so long Delays, who would have thought His hidden Flames would shew themselves at last, And kindle in his Breast, when mine expired? I can suppose, with you, he fears the Greeks; That it is Interest, and not Love, directs him; And, that my Eyes had greater Power o'er you. Orest. No, Princess, no! It is too plain he loves you: Your Eyes do what they will; and cannot fail To gain a Conquest, where you wish they should. Her. What can I do, alas!âmy Faith is promised: Can I refuse, what is not mine to give? A Princess is not at her Choice to love; All we have left us is a blind Obedience: And yet, you see, how far I had complyed, And made my Duty yield to your Intreaties. Orest. Ah, cruel Maid! you knewâbut I have done. All have a Right to please themselves in Love: I blame you not: 'Tis true I hop'd:âBut you Are Mistress of your Heart: And I am content. 'Tis Fortune is mine Enemy; not you. But, Madam, I shall spare your farther Pain On this uneasie Theme; and take my leave. SCENE III. Hermione and Cleone. Her. Cleone, could'st thou think he'd be so calm? Cle. Madam, this silent Grief sits heavy on him. He is to be pityed: His too eager Love Has made him busie to his own Destruction. His Threats have wrought this Change of Mind in Pyrrhus. Her. Doest thou think Pyrrhus capable of Fear? Whom should the intrepid Pyrrhus fear? The Greeks? Did he not lead their harrassed Troops to Conquest, When they dispaired; when they retired from Troy, And sought for Shelter in their burning Fleets? Did he not then supply his Father's Place? No! my Cleone; he is above Constraint: He Acts unforced; and where he weds, he loves. Cle. Oh, that Orestes had remain'd in Greece! I fear to-Morrow will prove Fatal to him. Her. Wilt thou discourse of nothing, but Orestes? Pyrrhus is mine again!âIs mine for ever! Oh my Cleone! I am wild with Joy!â Pyrrhus, the Bold! the Brave! The Godlike Pyrrhus! âOh, I could tell thee numberless Exploits, And tire thee with his Battels!âOh, Cleoneâ Cle. Madam, conceal your Joy.âI see Andromache: She weeps, and comes to speak her Sorrows to you. Her. I would indulge the Gladness of my Heart! Let us retire: Her Grief is out of Season. SCENE IV. Andromache, Hermione, Cleone, and Cephisa. And. Ah, Madam! whither, whither do you fly? Where can your Eyes behold a Sight more pleasing, Than Hector's Widow suppliant, and in Tears? I come not an alarmed, a jealous Foe, To envy you the Heart your Charms have won: The only Man I sought to please, is gone; Kiled in my Sight, by an inhuman Hand. Hector first taught me Love; which my fond Heart Shall ever cherish, till we meet in Death. But, Oh, I have a Son!âAnd you, one Day, Will be no Stranger to a Mother's Fondness: But Heaven forbid, that you should ever know A Mother's Sorrow for an only Son, Her Joy, her Bliss, her last surviving Comfort! When every Hour she trembles for his Life! Your Power o'er Pyrrhus may relieve my Fears. Alas! what Danger is there in a Child, Saved from the Wreck of a whole ruined Empire? Let me go hide him, in some Desart Isle: You may rely upon my tender Care, To keep him far from Perils of Ambition: All, he can learn of me, will be to weep! Her. Madam, 'tis easie to conceive your Grief: But, it would ill become me, to sollicit In Contradiction to my Father's Will: 'Tis he, who urges to destroy your Son. Madam, if Pyrrhus must be wrought to Pity, No Woman does it better, than your self: If you gain him, I shall comply of Course. SCENE V. Andromache, and Cephisa. And. Did'st thou not mind, with what Disdain she spoke! Youth and Prosperity have made her vain: She has not seen the fickle Turns of Life. Ceph. Madam, were I as you, I'd take her Counsel; I'd speak my own Distress: One Look from you Will vanquish Pyrrhus, and confound the Greeksâ See, where he comes!âLay hold on this Occasion. SCENE VI. Pyrrhus, Andromache, PhÅnix and Cephisa. Pyr. Where is the Princess?âDid you not inform me, Hermione was here? [To PhÅnix.. PhÅn. I thought so, Sir. And. Thou seest, what mighty Power my Eyes have on him! [To Cephisa. Pry. What says she, PhÅnix? And. I have no Hope left! PhÅn. Let us be gone:âHermione expects you. Ceph. What do you, Madam?âBreak this sullen Silence. Andr. My Child's already promised!â Ceph. But not given. Andr. No! no!âmy Tears are vain! His Doom is fixt! Pyr. See, if she deigns to cast one Look upon us! Proud Woman! Andr. I provoke him by my Presence. Let us retire. Pyr. Come let us satisfie The Greeks; and give them up this Phrygian Boy. Andr. Ah, Sir, recall those Words!âWhat have you said! If you give up my Son, Oh give up me!â You, who so many-Times have sworn me Friendship; Oh Heavens!âwill you not look with Pity on me? Is there no Hope? Is there no Room for Pardon? Pyr. PhÅnix will answer you:âMy Word is past. Andr. You, who would brave so many Dangers for me. Pyr. I was your Lover then: I now am free. To favour you, I might have spared his Life: But you would ne'er vouchsafe to ask it of me. Now 'tis too late. Andr. Ah, Sir, you understand My Tears, my Wishes, which I durst not utter, Afraid of a Repulse. Oh, Sir, excuse The Pride of Royal Blood, that checks my Soul, And knows not how to be importunate. You know, alas! I was not born to kneel, To sue for Pity, and to own a Master. Pyr. No! in your heart you curse me! you disdain My generous Flame, and scorn to be obliged! This very Son, this Darling of your Soul, Would be less dear, did I preserve him for you. Your Anger, your Aversion fall on me; You hate me more than the whole League of Grece: But, I shall leave you to your great Resentments. Let us go, PhÅnix, and appease the Greeks. Andr. Then let me dye! And let me go to Hector! Ceph. But, Madamâ Andr. What can I do more? The Tyrant Sees my Distraction, and insults my Tears! [To Cephisa.] âBehold how low you have reduced a Queen! These Eyes have seen my Country laid in Ashes; My Kindred fall in War; my Father slain; My Husband dragged in his own Blood; My Son Condemned to Bondage; and my self a Slave. Yet, in the midst of these unheard-of Woes, 'Twas some Relief to find my self your Captive; And that my Son, derived from ancient Kings, Since he must serve, had Pyrrhus for his Master. When Priam kneeled, the great Achilles wept: I hoped I should not find his Son less noble: I thought the Brave were still the most compassionate. Oh, do not, Sir, divide me from my Child!â If he must dyeâ Pyr. PhÅnix, withdraw a while. SCENE VII. Pyrrhus and Andromache. Pyr. Rise, Madam.âYet you may preserve your Son. I find, whenever I provoke your Tears, I furnish you with Arms against my self. I thought my Hatred fixt, before I saw you. Oh, turn your Eyes upon me, while I speak! And see, if you discover in my Looks An angry Judge, or an obdurate Foe. Why will you force me to desert your Cause? In your Son's Name I beg we may be Friends: Let me intreat you to secure his Life! Must I turn Suppliant for him? Think, Oh think, ('Tis the last time) you both may yet be happy! I know the Ties I break; the Foes I arm: I wrong Hermonie; I send her hence; And with her Diadem I bind your Brows. Consider well; for, 'tis of Moment to you! Chuse to be wretched, Madam, or a Queen. My Soul, consumed with a whole Year's Despair, Can bear no longer these perplexing Doubts. Enough of Sighs, and Tears, and Threats I have try'd. I know, if I am deprived of you, I die: But, oh, I die, if I wait longer for you! I leave you to your Thoughts. When I return, We'll to the Temple: There you'll find your Son; And there be crown'd, or give him up for ever. SCENE VIII. Andromache and Cephisa. Ceph. I told you, Madam, that, in spight of Greece, You would o'er-rule the Malice of your Fortune. Andr. Alas! Cephisa, what have I obtain'd! Only a poor, short Respite for my Son. Ceph. You have enough approved your Faith to Hector: To be reluctant still would be a Crime. He would himself persuade you to comply. And. How!âwouldst thou give me Pyrrhus for a Husband? Ceph. Think you 'twill please the Ghost of your dead Husband, That you should sacrifice his Son? Consider, Pyrrhus once more invites you to a Throne; Turns all his Power against the Foes of Troy; Remembers not Achilles was his Father; Retracts his Conquests, and forgets his Hatred. Andr. But how can I forget them! How can I Forget my Hector, treated with Dishonour; Deprived of Funeral Rites; and vilely dragged, A bloody Coarse, about the Walls of Troy? Can I forget the good old King his Father, Slain in my Presence; at the Altar slain! Which vainly for Protection he embraced. Hast thou forgot that dreadful Night, Cephisa, When a whole People fell! Methinks I see Pyrrhus, enraged and breathing Vengeance, enter Amidst the Glare of burning Palaces: I see him hew his Passage through my Brothers; And, bathed in Blood, lay all my Kindred waste. Think, in this Scene of Horrour, what I suffer'd! This is the Courtship I receiv'd from Pyrrhus; And this the Husband thou would'st give me!âNo; We both will perish first! I'll ne'er consent. Ceph. Since you resolve Astyanax shall dye, Haste to the Temple: Bid your Son farewell. Why do you tremble, Madam? Andr. Oh Cephisa! Thou hast awakened all the Mother in me. How can I bid Farewell to the dear Child, The Pledge, the Image of my much-loved Lord! Alass, I call to mind the fatal Day, When his too forward Courage led him forth To seek Achilles. Ceph. Oh, the unhappy Hour! 'Twas then Troy fell, and all her Gods forsook her. Andr. That Morn, Cephisa! That ill-fated Morn! My Husband bid thee bring Astyanax; He took him in his Arms; and, as I wept, My Wife, my Dear Andromache, said he, (Heaving with stifled Sighs to see me weep) What Fortune may attend my Arms, the Gods Alone can tell: To thee I give the Boy; Preserve him as the Token of our Loves: If I should fall, let him not miss his Sire While thou survivest, but by thy tender Care Let the Son see, that thou didst love his Father. Ceph. And will you throw away a Life so precious? At once extirpate all the Trojan Line? Andr. Inhuman King! What has he done to suffer? If I neglect your Vows, is he to blame? Has he reproach'd you with his slaughter'd Kindred? Can he resent those Ills he does not know?â But oh! While I deliberate he dies. No, no, thou must not dye, while I can save thee: Oh! let me find out PyrrhusâOh Cephisa! Do thou go find him. Ceph. What must I say to him? Andr. Tell him I love my Son to such Excessâ But dost thou think he means the Child shall dye? Can Love rejected turn to so much Rage? Ceph. Madam, he'll soon be hereâResolve on something. And. Well then, assure himâ Ceph. Madam, of your Love? Andr. Alass thou know'st that is not in my Power. Oh my dead Lord! Oh Priam's Royal House! Oh my Astyanax! at what a Price Thy Mother buys thee? Let us go. Cep. But whither? And what does your unsettled Heart resolve? Andr. Come my Cephisa, let us go together, To the sad Monument which I have rais'd To Hector's Shade; where in their sacred Urn The Ashes of my Hero lye enclosed, The dear Remains which I have saved from Troy; There let me weep, there summon to my Aid, With pious Rites, my Hector's awful Shade; Let him be Witness to my Doubts, my Fears, My agonizing Heart, my flowing Tears: Oh! may he rise in Pity from his Tomb, And fix his wretched Son's uncertain Doom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Andromache, Cephisa. Ceph. Blest be the Tomb of Hector, that inspires These Thoughts: Or is it Hector's self, That prompts you to preserve your Son? 'Tis he, Who still presides o'er ruin'd Troy; 'tis he, Who urges Pyrrhus to restore Astyanax. Andr. Pyrrhus has said he will: And thou hast heard him Just now renew the oft-repeated Promise. Ceph. Already in the Transports of his Heart, He gives you up his Kingdom, his Allies, And thinks himself-o'er paid for all in you. Andr. I think I may rely upon his Promise: And yet my Heart is overcharged with Grief. Ceph. Why should you grieve? You see he bids Defiance To all the Greeks: And to protect your Son Against their Rage, has placed his Guards about him; Leaving himself defenceless for his sake: But Madam, think the Coronation Pomps Will soon demand your Presence in the Temple: 'Tis Time you lay aside these Mourning Weeds. Andr. I will be there; but first would see my Son. Ceph. Madam, you need not now be anxious for him: He will be always with you, all your own, To lavish the whole Mother's Fondness on him. What a Delight to train beneath your Eye A Son, who grows no longer up in Bondage; A Son in whom a Race of Kings revives? But Madam, you are sad, and wrapt in Thought, As if you relish'd not your Happiness. Andr. Oh I must see my Son once more, Cephisa. Ceph. Madam, he now will be no more a Captive; Your Visits may be frequent as you please. To morrow you may pass the live long day.â Andr. To morrow! Oh Cephisa!âBut no more! Cephisa, I have always found thee faithful: A Load of Care weighs down my drooping Heart. Ceph. Oh! that 'twere possible for me to ease you. Andr. I soon shall exercise thy long-try'd Faith!â Mean while I do conjure thee, my Cephisa, Thou take no Notice of my present Trouble; And, when I shall disclose my secret Purpose, That thou be punctual to perform my Will. Ceph. Madam, I have no Will but yours. My Life Is nothing, ballanced with my Love to you. Andr. I thank thee, good Cephisa: my Astyanax Will recompense thy Friendship to his Mother. But, come: my Heart's at Ease: Assist me now To change this sable Habit.âYonder comes Hermione: I would not meet her Rage. SCENE II. Hermione, Cleone. Cle. This unexpected Silence, this Reserve, This outward Calm, this settled Frame of Mind, After such Wrongs and Insults, much surprize me! You, who before could not command your Rage, When Pyrrhus look'd but kindly on his Captive; How can you bear unmoved, that he should wed her, And seat her on a Throne which you should fill? I fear this dreadful Stillness in your Soul! 'Twere better, Madamâ Herm. Have you call'd Orestes? Cle. Madam, I have. His Love is too impatient, Not to obey with speed the welcome Summons. His love-sick Heart o'er-looks his unkind Usage: His Ardour's still the same.âMadam, he's here. SCENE III. Orestes, Hermione, Cleone. Orest. Ah Madam, is it true? does then Orestes At length attend you by your own Commands? What can I doâ Herm. Orestes, do you love me? Orest. What means that Question, Princess? do I love you? My Oaths, my Perjuries, my Hopes, my Fears, My Farewel, my Return, all speak my Love. Herm. Avenge my Wrongs, and I believe them all: Orest. It shall be doneâmy Soul has catch'd the Alarm! We'll spirit up the GreeksâI'll lead them on: Your Cause shall animate our Fleets and Armies. Let us return: let us not lose a Moment, But urge the Fate of this devoted Land: Let us depart. Her. No Prince, let us stay here! I will have Vengeance hereâI will not carry This load of Infamy to Greece: nor trust The Chance of War to vindicate my Wrongs: Ere I depart I'll make Epirus mourn; If you avenge me, let it be this Instant; My rage brooks no Delayâhaste to the Temple, Haste Prince, and sacrifice him: Orest. Whom? Herm. Why Pyrrhus. Orest. Pyrrhus? did you say Pyrrhus? Herm. You demurr? Oh fly, be gone! give me not time to think! Talk not of Lawsâhe tramples on all Lawsâ Let me not hear him justify'd,âaway. Orest. You cannot think I'll justify my Rival. Madam, your Love has made him criminal. You shall have Vengeance; I'll have Vengeance too: But let our Hatred be profest and open; Let us alarm all Greece, denounce a War; Let us attack him in his Strength, and hunt him down By Conquest: should I turn a base Assassin, 'Twould sully all the Kings I represent. Herm. Have not I been dishonour'd? set at nought? Expos'd to publick Scornâand will you suffer The Tyrant who dares use me thus, to live? Know Prince, I hate him more than once I loved him. The Gods alone can tell how once I loved him: Yes, the false perjur'd Man, I once did love him; And spight of all his Crimes and broken Vows, If he should live I may relapseâwho knows But I to Morrow may forgive his Wrongs! Orest. First let me tear him piecemealâhe shall dye. But Madam, give me leisure to contrive The Place, the Time, the Manner of his Death: Yet I'm a Stranger in the Court of Pyrrhus; Scarce have I set my Foot within Epirus, When you enjoin me to destroy the Prince. It shall be done this very Night. Herm. But now, This very Hour he weds Andromache; The Temple shines with pomp; the golden Throne Is now prepared; the joyful Rites begin; My Shame is publickâoh be speedy Prince! My wrath's ImpatientâPyrrhus lives too long! Intent on Love and heedless of his Person, He covers with his Guards the Trojan Boy. Now is the Time; assemble all your Greeks: Mine shall assist them; let their Fury loose: Already they regard him as a Foe. Be gone Orestesâkill the faithless Tyrant! My Love shall recompence the glorious Deed. Orest. Consider, Madamâ Herm. You but mock my Rage! I was contriving how to make you happy. Think you to merit by your idle Sighs; And not attest your Love by one brave Action Go! with your boasted Constancy! and leave Hermione to execute her own Revenge! I blush to think how my too easie Faith Has twice been baffled in one shameful Hour! Orest. Hear me but speak!âyou know I'll dye to serve you! Herm. I'll go my self: I'll stab him at the Altar: Then drive the Poignard, reeking with his Blood, Through my own Heart. In Death we shall unite: Better to dye with him, than live with you! Orest. That were to make him blest; and me more wretched: Madam, he dyes by me!âHave you a Foe, And shall I let him live?âMy Rival too? Ere yon Meridian Son declines, he dyes: And you shall say, that I deserve your Love. Herm. Go Prince; strike home! And leave the rest to me. Let all your Ships stand ready for our Flight. SCENE IV. Hermione, Cleone. Cle. Madam, you'll perish in this bold Attempt. Herm. Give me my Vengeance, I am content to perish. I was to blame to trust it with another: In my own Hands it had been more secure. Orestes hates not Pyrrhus, as I hate him: I should have thrust the Dagger home; have seen The Tyrant curse me with his parting Breath, And roll about his dying Eyes in vain, To find Andromache, whom I would hide. Oh, would Orestes, when he gives the Blow, Tell him he dyes my Victim!âhaste Cleone; Charge him to say, Hermione's Resentments, Not those of Greece, have sentenced him to Death. Haste my Cleone! My Revenge is lost, If Pyrrhus knows not that he dyes by me! Cle. I shall obey your Orders, MadamâBut I see The King!âWho could expect him here! Herm. Oh fly! Cleone, fly! and bid Orestes Not to proceed a Step before I see him. SCENE. V. Hermione, Pyrrhus. Pyr. Madam, I ought to shun an injur'd Princess: Your distant Looks reproach me; and I come Not to defend, but to avow my Guilt. Pyrrhus will ne'er approve his own Injustice; Nor form Excuses, while his Heart condemns him. I might perhaps alledge our warlike Sires, Unknown to us, engaged us to each other; And joyn'd our Hearts by Contract, not by Love. But I detest such Cobweb Arts: I own My Father's Treaty, and allow it's Force. I sent Ambassadours to call you hither; Receiv'd you as my Queen; and hoped my Oaths, So oft renew'd, might ripen into Love. The Gods can witness, Madam, now I fought Against Andromache's too fatal Charms! And still I wish I had the Power to leave This Trojan Beauty, and be just to you. Discharge your Anger on this perjur'd Man! For I abhor my Crime! and should be pleas'd To hear you speak your Wrongs aloud: No Terms, No Bitterness of Wrath, nor keen Reproach, Will equal Half the Upbraidings of my Heart. Herm. I find, Sir, you can be sincere: You scorn To act your Crimes with Fear like other Men. A Hero should be bold; above all Laws; Be bravely false; and laugh at solemn Ties. To be perfidious shews a daring Mind: And you have nobly triumphed o'er a Maid! To court me; to reject me; to return; Then to forsake me for a Phrygian Slave: To lay proud Troy in Ashes; then to raise The Son of Hector, and renounce the Greeks: Are Actions worthy the great Soul of Pyrrhus. Pyr. Madam, go on: give your Resentments Birth; And pour forth all your Indignation on me. Herm. 'Twould please your Queen, should I upbraid your falsehood; Call you perfidious, Traitor, all the Names That injured Virgins lavish on your Sex; I should o'erflow with Tears, and dye with Grief, And furnish out a Tale to sooth her Pride: But, Sir, I would not over-charge her Joys. If you would charm Andromache, recount Your bloody Battles, your Exploits, your Slaughters, Your great Atcheivements in her Father's Palace: She needs must love the Man, who fought so bravely, And in her Sight slew Half her Royal Kindred. Pyr. With Horrour I look back on my past Deeds! I punish'd Helen's Wrongs too far; I shed Too much of Blood: But, Madam, Helen's Daughter Should not object those Ills the Mother caused. However, I am pleased to find you hate me: I was too forward to accuse my self: The Man who ne'er was loved, can ne'er be false. Obedience to a Father brought you hither; And I stood bound by Promise to receive you: But our Desires were different Ways inclined; And you, I own, were not obliged to love me. Herm. Have I not loved you then! perfidious Man! For you I slighted all the Grecian Princes; Forsook my Father's House; conceal'd my Wrongs, When most provoked; would not return to Sparta: In hopes, that Time might fix your wavering Heart. I loved you, when inconstant: and even now, Inhumane King, that you pronounce my Death, My Heart still doubts, if I should love, or hate you. But, Oh, since you resolve to wed another, Defer your cruel purpose till to Morrow! That I may not be here to grace her Triumph: This is the last Request, I e'er shall make you.â See, if the barbarous Prince vouchsafes an Answer! Go, then, to the loved Phrygian; hence! be gone! And bear to her those Vows, that once were mine: Go in Defiance to the avenging Gods! Be gone! The Priest expects you at the Altarâ But Tyrant, have a Care I come not thither. SCENE VI. Pyrrhus, PhÅnix. PhÅn. Sir, did you mind her Threats? your Life's in Danger: There is no trifling with a Woman's Rage. The Greeks, that swarm about the Court, all hate you; Will treat you as their Country's Enemy, And joyn in her Revenge: Besides, Orestes Still Loves her to Distraction: Sir, I begâ. Pyr. How! PhÅnix:âshould I fear a Woman's Threats? A nobler Passion takes up all my Thought: I must prepare to meet Andromache. Do thou place all my Guards about her Son: If he be safe, Pyrrhus is free from Fear. SCENE VII. PhÅnix , alone. Oh Pyrrhus! Oh, what Pity 'tis, the Gods, Who fill'd thy Soul with every kingly Virtue, Formed thee for Empire and consummate Greatness, Should leave thee so exposed to wild Desires, That hurry thee beyond the Bounds of Reason! Such was Achilles: Generous, fierce, and brave; Open, and undesigning: But impatient, Undisciplin'd, and not to be controul'd. I fear this Whirl of Passion, this Career, That over-bears Reflection and cool Thought. I tremble for the Event!âBut see, the Queen, Magnificent in royal Pride, appears. I must obey, and guard her Son from Danger. SCENE VIII. Andromache, Cephisa. Ceph. Madam, once more you look and move a Queen! Your Sorrows are dispersed; your Charms revive, And every faded Beauty blooms anew. Andr. Yet all is not as I could wish Cephisa. Ceph. You see the King is watchful o'er your Son; Decks him with princely Robes, with Guards surrounds him: Astyanax begins to reign already. Andr. Pyrrhus is nobly minded; and I fain Would live to thank him for Astyanax: 'Tis a vain ThoughtâHowever, since my Child Has such a Friend, I ought not to repine. Ceph. These dark Unfoldings of your Soul perplex me: What meant those Floods of Tears, those warm Embraces, As if you bid your Son Adieu for ever? For Heaven's Sake, Madam, let me know your Griefs! If you distrust my Faithâ Andr. That were to wrong thee. Oh, my Cephisa! This gay borrowed Air, This Blaze of Jewels, and this bridal Dress, Are but mock-Trappings to conceal my Woe: My Heart still mourns; I still am Hector's Widow. Ceph. Will you then break the Promise given to Pyrrhus; Blow up his Rage afresh, and blast your Hopes? Andr. I thought, Cephisa, thou had'st known thy Mistress! Could'st thou believe I would be false to Hector? Fall off from such a Husband! Break his Rest, And call him to this hated Light again, To see Andromache in Pyrrhus Arms! Would Hector, were he living and I dead, Forget Andromache, and wed her Foe? Ceph. I cannot guess what Drift your Thoughts pursue: But, oh, I fear there's something dreadful in it! Must then Astyanax be doomed to dye; And you to linger out a Life in Bondage? Andr. Nor this, nor that, Cephisa, will I bear: My Word is past to Pyrrhus, his to me; And I rely upon his promis'd Faith. Unequal as he is, I know him well: Pyrrhus is violent; but he is sincere, And will perform beyond what he has sworn: The Greeks will but incense him more; their Rage Will make him cherish Hector's Son. Ceph. Ah, Madam! Explain these Riddles to my boading Heart! Andr. Thou may'st remember, for thou oft hast heard me Relate the dreadful Vision, which I saw, When first I landed Captive in Epirus. That very Night, as in a Dream I lay, A ghastly Figure, full of gaping Wounds, His Eyes a-glare, his Hair all stiff with Blood, Full in my Sight thrice shook his Head and groaned. I soon discern'd my slaughter'd Hector's Shade; But, oh, how changed! Ye Gods, how much unlike The living Hector!âLoud he bid me fly! Fly from Achilles Son! Then sternly frown'd, And disappear'd: Struck with the dreadful Sound, I started and awaked. Ceph. But did he bid you Destroy Astranax? Andr. Cephisa, I'll preserve him; With my own Life, Cephisa, I'll preserve him. Ceph. What may these Words, so full of Horrour, mean? Andr. Know then the secret Purpose of my Soul: Andromache will not be false to Pyrrhus; Nor violate her sacred Love to Hector. This Hour I'll meet the King; the holy Priest Shall joyn us, and confirm our mutual Vows. This will secure a Father to my Child. That done, I have no farther Use for Life: This pointed Dagger, this determin'd Hand, Shall save my Virtue, and conclude my Woes. Ceph. Ah, Madam! Recollect your scatter'd Reason! This fell Dispair ill suits your present Fortunes. Andr. No other Stratagem can serve my Purpose: This is the sole Expedient, to be just To Hector, to Astyanax, to Pyrrhus. I soon shall visit Hector, and the Shades Of my great AncestorsâCephisa, thou Wilt lend a Hand to close thy Mistress Eyes. Ceph. Oh, never think, that I will stay behind you! Andr. No, my Cephisa, I must have thee live. Remember thou did'st promise to obey, And to be secret: Wilt thou now betray me? After thy long, thy faithful Service, wilt thou Refuse my last Commands, my dying Wish? Once more, I do conjure thee, live for me! Ceph. Life is not worth my Care, when you are gone. Andr. I must commit into thy faithful Hands, All that is dear and precious to my Soul: Live, and supply my Absence to my Child. All that remains of Troy; a future Progeny Of Heroes; and a distant Line of Kings, In him, is all intrusted to thy Care. Ceph. But, Madam, what will be the Rage of Pyrrhus, Defrauded of his promis'd Happiness? Andr. That will require thy utmost Skill: Observe The first impetuous Onsets of his Grief: Use every Artifice to keep him stedfast. Sometimes with Tears thou may'st discourse of me: Speak of our Marriage: Let him think I loved him. Tell him my Soul repos'd it self on him, When I resign'd my Son to his Protection. Ceph. Oh, for a Spirit to support my Grief! Is there ought more, before you go for ever? Andr. Oh my Cephisa! my swollen Heart is full! I have a thousand Farewels to my Son:â But Tears break inâGrief interrupts my Speechâ My Soul o'erflows in Fondness!âLet him know, I dy'd to save him:âAnd would dye again. Season his Mind with early Hints of Glory: Make him acquainted with his Ancestors; Trace out their shining Story in his Thoughts: Dwell on the Exploits of his immortal Father; And sometimes let him hear his Mother's Name. Let him reflect upon his Royal Birth With modest Pride: Pyrrhus will prove a Friend; But let him know, he has a Conquerour's Right. He must be taught to stifle his Resentments, And sacrifice his Vengeance to his Safety: Should he prove head-strong, rash, or unadvised, He then will frustrate all his Mother's Virtue; Provoke his Fate; and I shall dye in vain. Ceph. Alass, I fear, I never shall out live you! Andr. No more:âThy Tears, Cephisa, will betray me: Assume a chearful Look: But still rememberâ [Flourish within. Hark, how the Trumpet, with its sprightly Notes, Proclaims the appointed Hour, and calls us hence! Hector, I come, once more a Queen, to join thee! Thus the gay Victim, with fresh Garlands crown'd, Pleased with the sacred Fife's enlivening Sound, Through gazing Crowds, in solemn State, proceeds; And, drest in fatal Pomp, magnificently bleeds. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Hermione alone. What have I done? where am I? where is Pyrrhus? Ye Gods! what mean these Horrours?âI am undone! My Soul is on the Rack!âI cannot bear it!â Why do I wander like some guilty Ghost? What brought me to this Place? what keeps me here? The Court of Pyrrhus has no Room for me!â Do I still doubt if I should love or hate him? Hard-hearted Man! How unconcern'd he left me! Did he once sigh? bestow one pitying Look? Once shed a Tear? or speak one soft kind Word? Did he so much as feign one Moment's Sorrow, To calm my Griefs, and mitigate his Falshood? âWhy am I still thus anxious for his Life? Why do I start at his impending Fate? Shall he then live; shall the base Traytor live To laugh at my Distress? No, let him perish! Be quick, Orestes!âExecute my Orders! Alass! my Orders? Oh preposterous Guilt! Can I decree the Death of him I love? Was it for this my Soul delighted in him? Was it for this I left my Father's Court? Have I then cross'd so many Realms and Seas, To murder Pyrrhus?â SCENE II. Hermione, Cleone. Herm. Oh, Cleone, help me! What have I done? Is Pyrrhus yet alive? What say'st thou?âAnswer me! Where is the King? Cle. Madam, I saw the cruel Prince set forward, Triumphant in his Looks, and full of Joy. Still, as he walk'd, his ravish'd Eyes were fixt On the fair Captive; while through shouting Crowds She pass'd along with a dejected Air, And seem'd to mourn her Hector to the last. Herm. Insulting Tyrant! I shall burst with Rage!â But say, Cleone, didst thou mark him well? Was his Brow smooth? Say, did there not appear Some Shade of Grief? some little Cloud of Sorrow? Did he not stop? did he not once look back? Didst thou approach him? Was he not confounded? Did he notâOh, be quick! and tell me all! Cle. Madam, the Tumult of his Joy admits No Thought, but Love. Unguarded he marched on 'Midst a promiscuous Throng of Friends and Foes. His Cares all turn upon Astyanax, Whom he has lodged within the Cittadel, Defended by the Strength of all his Guards. Herm. Enough!âhe dyes!âthe Traytor!âwhere's Orestes? Cle. He is in the Temple, with his whole Retinue. Herm. Is he still resolute? is he determin'd? Cle. Madam, I fearâ Herm. How!âIs Orestes false? Does he betray me too! Cle. A thousand Doubts Perplex his Soul, and wound him with Remorse: His Virtue and his Love prevail by Turns. He told me Pyrrhus should not fall ignobly; Pyrrhus the warlike Son of great Achilles. He dreads the Censure of the Grecian States; Of all Mankind: And fears to stain his Honour. Herm. Poor, timorous Wretch! 'tis false! he basely fears To cope with Dangers, and encounter Death:â 'Tis that he fears!âAm I bright Helen's Daughter? To vindicate her Wrongs all Greece conspired; For Her Confederate Nations fought, and Kings were slain; Troy was o'er-thrown, and a whole Empire fell. My Eyes want Force to raise a Lover's Arm Against a Tyrant, that has dared to wrong me. Cle. Madam, like Helen, trust your Cause to Greece. Herm. No! I'll avenge my self! I'll to the Temple; I'll over-turn the Altar; stab the Priest! I'll hurl Destruction like a Whirlwind round me! They must not wed! they must not live! they shall not! Let me be gone! I have no Time to lose! Stand off! with-hold me not! I am all Distraction! Oh Pyrrhus! Tyrant! Traitor! Thou shalt bleed! SCENE III. Hermione, Cleone, Orestes. Orest. Madam, 'tis done: Your Orders are obeyed; The Tyrant lies expiring at the Altar. Herm. Is Pyrrhus slain?â Orest. Even now he gasps in Death. Our Greeks, all undistinguish'd in the Crowd, Flock'd to the Temple, and dispers'd themselves On every side the Altar:âI was there: Pyrrhus observed me, with a haughty Eye; And, proud to triumph over Greece in me, From his own Brows he took the Diadem, And bound it on the Temples of his Captive. Receive, said he, my Crown; receive my Faith; Mine and my People's Sovereign reign for ever. From this blest Hour, a Father to your Son, I'll scourge his Foes: Hence-forward be he stiled The Trojan King. I swear it at the Altar; And call the Gods to ratify my Vows. His Subjects with loud Acclamations shook The spatious Dome! Our Greeks, enraged, cry'd out Revenge! Revenge! broke through the thronging Press; And rush'd tumultuous on the unguarded King. Their eager Fury left no Work for me. Pyrrhus a while opposed their clashing Swords, And dealt his fatal Blows on every side, With Manly Fierceness; till opprest by Numbers, Streaming with Blood, all over gashed with Wounds, He reel'd, he groaned, and at the Altar fell. Haste, Madam; let us fly! haste to our Ships! They stand unmoored: Our Friends attend us there. Herm. What have they done! Orest. Madam, forgive their Rage. I own your Vengeance had been more compleat, Had Pyrrhus fallen by me; and had he known, Hermione chastised him by my Arm. Herm. Peace, Monster, Peace!âGo tell thy horrid Tale To Savages, and howl it out in Desarts. Would'st thou impute to me thy barbarous Guilt? Me would'st thou make the Accomplice of thy Crimes? Hence, to thy Greeks! and boast thy foul Exploits! My Soul abhors them! I disclaim the Deed! Be gone! I know thee not! Thou fell Barbarian! What had he done? What could provoke thy Madness To assassinate so great, so brave a Man! Who set thee on? Orest. Grant me Patience, Heaven! With your own Lips did you not curse the Tyrant, Pronounce his Death, and urge me to destroy him? Herm. What if, transported by my boundless Passion, I could not bear to see him wed another? Were you to obey a jealous Woman's Phrenzy? You should have dived into my inmost Thoughts: My Heart, though full of Rage, was free from Malice; And all my Anger was Excess of Love. Why did you take me at my Word? You saw The Struggles of my Soul; you heard me rave. You should have question'd me a Thousand Times; Yet still have doubted, and still question'd on, Before you ventured on a Life so precious. Orest. Hear me but speak:âHeaven knows, against my Will. Herm. Why did you not return? Why not consult me A Second time? And, undetermin'd still, Again return, and still find new Delays. What had your rash, officious Greeks, dire Blood-Hounds, To do with my Revenge? What drew you hither, To bring on me the vengeful Woes that haunt you? Are these the Fruits of your detested Love? Your fatal Embassy, your hateful Presence, Drove Pyrrhus to my Rival; and destroys Both him and me.âHe might have loved me still, Had you ne'er interposed.âAvant! Be gone! And leave me in Epirus.âI renounce My Friends, my Country, Greece, and all Mankind: But chiefly I renounce Thee! Monster, Thee! SCENE IV. Orestes. Am I awake! where am I! soft, my Soul: Be not too rash.âWas that Hermione? Why should her Anger thunder against me? Was not this Blood-shed all by her Command?â I am, indeed, a most outragious Monster! A Ruffian, Murderer, a base Assassin! And all to please a false ungrateful Woman. Henceforward let the Laws of Nations cease; And let the Pale, that severs Right and Wrong, Things Sacred and Prophane, be broken down: Gods in their Temples, Kings upon their Throne, Are not in safety, while Orestes lives. Oh, never more shall my torn Mind be healed, Nor taste the gentle Comforts of Repose! A dreadful Band of gloomy Cares surround me, And lay strong Siege to my distracted Soul. SCENE V. Orestes, Pylades, attended by Greeks. Pyl. Haste, Prince; let us be gone: 'Tis Death to stay. Andromache Reigns Queen: She gives the Alarm, And vows Revenge upon the Foes of Pyrrhus. The People arm and muster in the Streets: Our Greeks will not be able long to guard The Palace Gates, and to secure our Flight. We must be speedy, Sir. Orest. You may depart, My Friends:âHermione and I remain.â Her Cruelty has quite undone me!âGo, And leave me to my self.âI'll find her out. Pyl. Alass, unhappy Princess!âShe is no more: Forget her, Sir, and save your self with us. Orest. Hermione no more!âO all ye Powers! Pyl. Full of Disorder, Wildness in her Looks, With Hands expanded, and dishevelled Hair, Breathless and pale, with Shrieks she saught the Temple, In the mid-way she met the Corpse of Pyrrhus: She startled at the Sight: Then, stiff with Horrour, Gazed frightful! Wakened from the dire Amaze, She raised her Eyes to Heaven with such a Look, As spoke her Sorrows, and reproach'd the Gods: Then plunged a Poignard deep within her Breast, And fell on Pyrrhus, grasping him in Death. Orest. I thank you, Gods!âI never could expect To be so Wretched!âYou have been industrious To finish your Decrees; to make Orestes A dreadful Instance of your Power to Punish. I am singled out to bear the Wrath of Heaven. Pyl. You hazzard your Retreat by these Delays. The Guards will soon beset us. Your Complaints Are vain, and may be Fatal. Orest. True, my Friend: And therefore 'twas I thank'd the bounteous Gods. My Fate's accomplish'd!âI shall dye Content. Oh bear me hence!âBlow, Winds!â Pyl. Let us be gone. Orest. The murdered Lovers wait me.âHark! They call! Nay, if your Blood still reeks, I'll mingle mine. One Tomb will hold us all. Pyl. Alass! I fear His Ravings will return with his Misfortunes. Orest. I am dizzy!âClouds!âQuite lost in utter Darkness! Guide me, some friendly Pilot, through the Storm. I shiver!âOh, I freeze!âSo:âLight returns: 'Tis the grey Dawn.âSee, Pylades! Behold!â I am encompast with a Sea of Blood!â The crimson Billows!âOh! My Brain's on Fire! Pyl. How is it, Sir?âRepose your self on me. Orest. Pyrrhus, stand off!âWhat would'st thou?â How he glares! What envious Hand has closed thy Wounds?âHave at thee. It is Hermione that strikes.âConfusion! She catches Pyrrhus in her Arms.âOh, save me! How terrible she looks!âShe knits her Brow! She frowns me Dead: She frights me into Madness! Where am I?âWho are you?â Pyl. Alass, poor Prince! Help to support him.âHow he pants for Breath! Orest. This is most kind, my Pylades.âOh, why, Why was I born to give thee endless Trouble? Pyl. All will go well: He settles into Reason. Orest. Who talks of Reason?âBetter to have none, Than not enough.âRun, some one, tell my Greeks, I will not have them touch the King.âNow!âNow! I blaze again!âSee there!âLook where they come! A shoal of Furies!âHow they swarm about me! My Terrour!âHide me!âOh their snaky Locks! Hark! How they hiss!âSee! See their flaming Brands! Now they let drive full at me!âHow they grin, And shake their iron Whips!âMy Ears! What yelling! And see Hermione!âShe sets them on!â Thrust not your Scorpions thus into my Bosom! Oh!âI am stung to Death!âDispatch me soon! There:âTake my Heart, Hermione!âTear it out! Disjoynt me!âKill me!âOh, my tortured Soul!â Pyl. Kind Heaven restore him to his wonted Calm! Oft have I seen him Rave: But never thus: Quite spent!âAssist me Friends, to bear him off. Our Time is short: should his strong Rage return, 'Twould be beyond our Power to force him hence. Away, my Friends!âI hear the Portal open. SCENE VI. PhÅnix , attended by Guards. Fled, to a Man!âOrestes is not here!â Triumphant Villains!âThe base, giddy Rabble, Whose Hands should all have have been employed with Fire To waste the Fleet, flocked round the dying Princess: And, while they stand agaze, the Greeks embark. Oh, 'tis too plain!âThis Sacrilegious Murder Was authorised.âThe Ambassadour's Escape Declares his Guilt.âMost bloody Embassy! Most unexampled Deed!âWhere, where, ye Gods, Is Majesty secure, if in your Temples You give it no Protection!âSee; the Queen. SCENE VII. PhÅnix, Andromache, Cephisa, with Attendants. Andr. Yes, ye inhumane Greeks! The Time will come; When you shall dearly pay your bloody Deeds! How should the Trojans hope for Mercy from you, When thus you turn your impious Rage on Pyrrhus; Pyrrhus the bravest Man in all your League; The Man, whose single Valour made you Triumph. Is my Child there?â Ceph. It is the Corpse of Pyrrhus. The weeping Souldiers bear him on their Shields. Andr. Ill-fated Prince! Too negligent of Life! And too unwary of the faithless Greeks! Cut off in the fresh ripening Prime of Manhood, Even in the Pride of Life; thy Triumphs new, And all thy Glories in full Blossom round thee! The very Trojans would bewail thy Fate. Ceph. Alass, then will your Sorrows never End! Andr. Oh, never! neverâWhile I live, my Tears Will never cease; for I was Born to Grieve.â Give present Orders for the Funeral Pomps: [To PhÅn. Let him be robed in all his Regal State; Place round him every shining mark of Honour; And let the Pile, that Consecrates his Ashes, Rise like his Fame, and blaze above the Clouds. SCENE VIII. Andromache, Cephisa, with Attendants. Ceph. That Sound proclaims the Arrival of the Prince: The Guards conduct him from the Cittadel. Andr. With open Arms I'll meet him!âOh, Cephisa! A springing Joy, mixt with a soft Concern, A Pleasure, which no Language can Express, An Exstasie, that Mothers only feel, Plays round my Heart, and brightens up my Sorrow, Like Gleams of Sun-shine in a louring Skie. Though plunged in Ills, and exercised in Care, Yet never let the noble Mind despair. When prest by Dangers, and beset with Foes, The Gods their timely Succour interpose; And when our Vertue sinks, o'erwhelm'd with Grief, By unforeseen Expedients bring Relief. The End of the last ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. Budgell of the Inner-Temple. Spoken by Mrs. Oldfield. I hope you'll own that with becoming Art I've play'd my Game, and topp'd the Widow's Part; My Spouse, poor Man! could not live out the Play, But dy'd commodiously on Wedding-Day, While I his Relict made at one bold Fling My self a Princess, and young Sty a King. You Ladies who protract a Lover's Pain, And hear your Servants sigh whole Years in vain; Which of you all would not on Marriage venture, Might she so soon upon her Jointure enter? 'Twas a strange Scape! had Pyrrhus liv'd till now I had been finely hamper'd in my Vow. To dye by ones own Hand, and fly the Charms Of Love and Life in a young Monarch's Arms! 'Twere an hard Fateâe'er I had undergone it I might have took one Nightâto think upon it. But why you'll say was all this Grief exprest For a first Husband, laid long since at Rest? Why so much Coldness to my kind Protector? âAh Ladies! had you known the good Man Hector!</field>
