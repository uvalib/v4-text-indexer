LORD BISHOP OF ST DAVID'S, AND TO THE MEMORY OF JULIUS CHARLES HARE, M.A. Friends in your boyhood, when the dawn was bright, Friends in the heat and burden of the day, Friends even yet, though one has passed away To join the children of the Lord of Light! Long since ye roamed each vale, and climbed each height, Where songs of Hellas float through golden grove, Or from the hill of Capitolian Jove, Tracked the young stream of Rome's imperial might. Our friend and brother heareth loftier praise; But thou, kind teacher, speakest to us still, And wilt not scorn, scant offering though they be, These echoes of high thoughts of ancient days.

      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The favourable reception which has been given to the first edition of this translation, in spite of its many imperfections, has shown that I was not wrong in thinking that such a work was likely, if only it were worthily executed, to fill a gap in the translated literature of our time. New versions of the Iliad and Odyssey appear in almost every conceivable form of English versification. Of Ãschylos there have, of late years, been several partial or complete translations. In working upon Sophocles I have but three predecessors: Francklin, in 1758; Potter, in 1788; Dale, in 1825. English versions of single plays have been published: the Antigone by Dr Donaldson in 1848, and the Aias by Mr D'Arcy Thompson in 1862. A few choruses, rendered with great skill and elegance, are to be found in the late Mr Anstice's Translations from Greek Choral Poetry. These have, all of them, I believe, been for several years out of print, and it was, in part, the feeling that I was entering on unoccupied ground which led me to undertake a task which might well have called for higher culture and more abundant leisure. Kindly as my work has been received, I cannot blind myself either to the demerits which critics have pointed out, or those (many more in number) which the work of revision has brought under my notice. Partly from the fact that the work was done chiefly in the scant intervals of leisure left by my usual labours, partly from the wish to get it over and done with before I entered on fresh tasks of another kind, it was carried through the press with somewhat undue haste; required, more or less, pruning and correction throughout, and called, in some instances, for a reconsideration of the principles of translation on which I had acted. I have endeavoured, in revising it, to remedy these defects, and trust that they are, at least, materially reduced in number. The points in which I have seen reason (over and above changes in the translation of many words and phrases) to modify the judgments which I expressed in the preface to the first edition are as follows:â (1.) I retain the conviction that unrhymed verse, if only it be melodious enough, and analogous to the tone and feeling of the original, is the best representative of the choral ode of the Greek tragic poets. Rhyme still seems to me, as I then said, to introduce an element more or less incongruous, to fetter the free flow of thought by the periodicity of the same sound recurring at fixed intervals, to present a temptation, very difficult to guard against, to expansion and over-ornamentation for the sake of it. If I had but few precedents to appeal to among those who had gone before me as translators, Mr Matthew Arnold's employment of unrhymed metres in his Merope gave then, and the exquisite drama of Philoctetes, published anonymously last year, has given since, abundant proof how capable that form is of approximating in melody and beauty to the perfection of the Sopho-clean choruses. On the other hand, there has been something not far from a consensus of critics in favour of rhyme, and many readers among my friends have expressed the same feeling. They missed what they had been accustomed to look upon as the indispensable accompaniment of all but the so-called heroic verse. At all events, they did not find in my translation that which compensated for its absence. I have accordingly endeavoured to meet their wants, without surrendering my own judgment, by adding a rhymed version of the choral odes and chief lyrical dialogues in an appendix. I must leave it to them to decide which attempt has been furthest removed from failure. (2.) On another point I have to make a more entire retractation. It seemed to me, when I entered on my task, that a reproduction of the symmetry, line by line, between the strophes and antistrophes of a choral ode would not give sufficient pleasure to the ear of an English reader to make the attempt, obviously more or less difficult, worth the time and labour it would cost; and that the delight which it gave to the Athenian hearer depended mainly on the accessories of music and motion by which it was accompanied. In going over my work again, I have come to a different conclusion. The impression made upon the ear, and even upon the eye of a reader, is, I believe, so far analogous to that which was made upon the spectator, that the attempt to reproduce it ought not to be hastily abandoned. It at least serves to indicate what is the crowning excellence of poetry in all its highest forms, the union of the most vigorous life, and freedom, and strong emotion, with a voluntary obedience to self-imposed laws of melody, and the consummate self-control and mastery over language which that obedience implies. In this edition, accordingly, both in the rhymed and unrhymed versions, I have endeavoured to preserve the symmetry in question throughout. (3.) In another less conspicuous matter I have also to acknowledge a change of opinion. In the first edition I, for the most part, deliberately broke up the single-line dialogues, the ???????????, which occur in every tragedy, into less regular lines and half lines, more in harmony with the forms of most of our English dramas. Here again, I believe, it would have been better to have been more faithful to the form of the original. Mr Swinburne's success in these portions of his Atalanta in Calydon has shown that it is quite possible to do so, and yet to escape the stiffness and monotony which at first seem almost inevitable. (4.) Admitting the force of much that may be said on the conservative side, in favour of retaining any received nomenclature and orthography, I have not seen reason to recede from the course which I took in the first edition, and have, in some instances, gone further in the same direction. It still seems to me right to give Greek mythology as it actually was, and not as it was seen through the medium of the speech of men who were bent upon identifying two polytheistic systems which were but partially in contact with each other. The more I compare the effect produced on one's mind by writers who adhere to the Latin forms of names, and by those, in our own country or in Germany, who return, as far as may be, to the Greek, the more I feel that the latter give one a sense of a distinct nationality and life which is wanting in the former. It is a gain, I believe, to get rid even of the Latinised termination in -us, and to reproduce the original in -os. (5.) I have thought it right to meet the wishes of many readers by prefixing to each play a short argument, giving so much and no more of the story, as may enable one who starts with but little previous knowledge to take up the action of the drama at the point at which it opens, and follow it without difficulty to the end. I have, in like manner, acted on the suggestion that for such readers it is desirable to give, here and there, brief explanatory notes, enabling them to understand local or mythological allusions for which they would otherwise have to refer to a classical dictionary. (6.) Lastly, I have indicated by brackets [] lines which are looked on by one or more critics of repute as spurious, and by an asterisk (*) the more prominent passages in which the text is so uncertain, or the construction so difficult, that the rendering must be looked on as, at best, somewhat uncertain. What has been said will show that the volume which I now bring to a completion is something more than a mere reprint. The labour which I have bestowed has, I trust, not been altogether fruitless. I have to thank the friends and critics whose suggestions have helped me in it, and to ask the forgiveness of that praiseworthy and often suffering class, the purchasers of first editions, for not having bestowed the same pains at an earlier stage of publication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. Laios, King of Thebes, married Jocasta, daughter of MenÅkeus, and they had no child. And he, grieved thereat, sought counsel of the God at Delphi, and the God bade him cease to wish for children, for should a son be born to him, by that son he should surely die. THE ORACLE TO LAIOS. Laios, Labdacos' son, thou askest for birth of fair offspring; Lo! I will give thee a son, but know that Destiny orders That thou by the boy's hand must die, for so to the curses of Pelops, Whom of his son thou hast robbed, Zeus, son of Kronos, hath granted, And he, in his trouble of heart, called all this sorrow upon thee. And then it came to pass that Jocasta bare him a son. And they, fearing the God's word, gave the boy to a shepherd, that he might cast it out upon the hill KithÃ¦ron; and so they were comforted, and deemed that they by this device had turned the oracle into a thing of nought. And thirty years afterwards, when Laios was well stricken in years, he went again on a pilgrimage to Delphi; and thence he never came back again,âslain on the way, men knew not by whose hands. And at that time the Sphinx made havoc of Thebes and all the coasts thereof, so that they had no heart nor power to search into the matter of the king's death, but sought only for some one to answer the monster's riddle, THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX. There lives upon earth a being, two-footed, yea, and with four feet, Yea, and with three feet, too, yet his voice continues unchanging; And, lo! of all things that move in earth, in heaven, or in ocean, He only changes his nature, and yet when on most feet he walketh, Then is the speed of his limbs most weak and utterly powerless. and save the city and its people. And a stranger came to the city, Ådipus of Corinth, son, as it was said, of Polybos and Merope, and answered the riddle aright, ANSWER OF ÅDIPUS. Hear thou against thy will, thou dark-winged Muse of the slaughtered, Hear from my lips the end, bringing a close to thy crime; Man is it thou hast described, who, when on earth he appeareth, First as a babe from the womb, four-footed creeps on his way, Then when old age cometh on, and the burden of years weighs full heavy, Bending his shoulders and neck, as a third foot useth his staff. and slew the Sphinx. And then the people of the city in their joy chose Ådipus as their king, in the room of Laios, who had been slain; and Jocasta took him as her husband, and Creon, Jocasta's brother, was his chief friend and counsellor, and all things prospered with him, and he had two sons and two daughters. But soon the wrath of God fell upon Thebes, and the city was visited with a sore pestilence; and the people turned in their affliction to their Gods, and made their supplications. The starting-point of the cycle of Ådipus' legends is found in the Odyssey, xi. 271, where Odysseus describes the spectres that he saw in Hades:â âAnd there I looked on Epicasta's form, Mother of Ådipus, who, knowing not, Wrought greatest guilt, her own son marrying; And he his father slew, and married her. But soon the Gods disclosed it all to men, And he, with many woes, in Thebes beloved, Through fateful counsels of the Gods, ruled long O'er the Cadmeians. She, with woe outworn, To Hades went, strong warder of the dead, A long noose letting down from lofty roof. And many a woe she left behind to him, Which the Erinnyes of his mother work.â With this it will be interesting to compare Pindar, Olymp., ii. 35-42:â âSo Destiny, who keeps of olden time The goodly fortune of an honoured race, With prosperous years from God, Leads it another while Backward to bale and woe: E'en when the fateful son of Laios killed The father whom he met, And so fulfilled The Oracle in Pytho given of old, And seeing it, she slew, Erinnyes, clear of sight, The warrior race, with fratricidal hand.â Ãschylos (B. C. 471) had made it the subject of a Trilogy, tracing the working of the curse in Laios, Ådipus, the Seven against Thebes, of which only the last is extant. The date of composition is uncertain. Hypotheses, which connect the description of the plague at Thebes with that at Athens in B. C. 429, or the protests against impiety with the mutilation of the HermÃ¦ in B. C. 415, are at best uncertain.</field>

For this our city, as thine eyes may see, Is sorely tempest-tossed, nor lifts its head From out the surging sea of blood-flecked waves, All smitten in the ripening blooms of earth, All smitten in the herds that graze the fields, Yea, and in timeless births of woman's fruit; And still the God, fire-darting Pestilence, As deadliest foe, upon our city swoops, And desolates the home where Cadmos dwelt, And Hades dark grows rich in sighs and groans. It is not that we deem of thee as one Equalled with Gods in power, that we sit here, These little ones and I, as suppliants prone; But, judging thee, in all life's shifting scenes, Chiefest of men, yea, and of chiefest skill In communings with Heaven. For thou did'st come And freed'st this city, named of Cadmos old, From the sad tribute which of yore we paid To that stern songstress, The tribute of human victims paid to the Sphinx, the âMuse of the slaughtered,â till her riddle was solved by Ådipus. all untaught of us, And all unprompted; but by gift of God, Men think and say, thou did'st our life upraise. And now, dear Ådipus, most honoured lord, We pray thee, we thy suppliants, find for us Some succour, whether voice of any God, Or any man brings knowledge to thy soul; For still I see, with those whom life has trained To long-tried skill, the issues of their thoughts Live and are mighty. Come then, noblest one, Raise up our city; come, take heed to it; As yet this land, for all thy former zeal, Calls thee its saviour: do not give us cause So to remember this thy reign, as men Who having risen, then fall low again; But raise our state to safety. Omens good Were then with thee; thou did'st thy work, and now Be equal to thyself! If thou wilt rule, As thou dost sway, this land wherein we dwell, 'Twere better far to rule o'er living men Than o'er a realm dispeopled. Nought avails, Or tower or ship, when men are not within. Ådip. O children, wailing loud, ye come with wish Well-known, not unknown; well I know that ye Are smitten, one and all, with taint of plague, And yet though smitten, none that taint of plague Feels, as I feel it. Each his burden bears, His own and not another's; but my heart Mourns for the state, for you, and for myself; And, lo, ye wake me not as plunged in sleep, But find me weeping, weeping many tears, And treading many paths in wandering thought And that one way of health I, seeking, found, This have I acted on. MenÅkeus' son, Creon, my kinsman, have I sent to seek The Pythian home of PhÅbos, there to learn The words or deeds wherewith to save the state; And even now I measure o'er the time, And ask, âHow fares he?â grieving, for he stays, Most strangely, far beyond the appointed day; But when he comes, I should be base indeed, Failing to do whate'er the God declares. Priest. Well hast thou spoken! And these bring me word, That Creon comes advancing on his way. Ådip. O king Apollo, may he come with chance That brings deliverance, as his looks are bright. Priest. If one may guess, he's glad. He had not come Crowned with rich wreaths Creon, coming from Delphi, wears a wreath of the Parnassian laurel, its red berries mingling with the dark, glossy leaves. of fruitful laurel else. Ådip. Soon we shall know. Our voice can reach him now. Say, prince, our well-beloved, MenÅkeus' son, What sacred answer bring'st thou from the God? Enter Creon. Creon. A right good answer! E'en our evil plight, If all goes well, may end in highest good. Ådip. What were the words? Nor full of eager hope, Nor trembling panic, list I to thy speech. Creon. I, if thou wish, am ready, these being by, To tell thee all, or go within the gates. Ådip. Speak out to all. I sorrow more for them Than for the woe which touches me alone. Creon. I then will speak what from the God I heard: King PhÅbos bids us chase the plague away (The words were plain) now cleaving to our land, Nor cherish guilt which still remains unhealed. Ådip. But with what rites? And what the deed itself? Creon. Or drive far off, or blood for blood repay; That guilt of blood is blasting all the state. Ådip. But whose fate is it that He pointeth to? Creon. Once, O my king, ere thou did'st guide our state, Our sovereign Laios ruled o'er all the land. Ådip. So have I heard, for him I never saw. Creon. Now the God clearly bids us, he being dead, To take revenge on those who shed his blood. Ådip. Yes; but where are they? How to track the course Of guilt all shrouded in the doubtful past? Creon. In this our land, so said He; those who seek Shall find; unsought, we lose it utterly. Ådip. Was it at home, or in the field, or else In some strange land that Laios met his doom? Creon. He went, so spake he, pilgrim-wise afar, And never more came back as forth he went. Ådip. Was there no courier, none who shared his road, Who knew what, learning, one might turn to good? Creon. Dead were they all, save one who fled for fear, And he knew nought to tell but one small fact. Ådip. [Interrupting.] And what was that? One fact might teach us much, Had we but one small starting-point of hope. Creon. He used to tell that robbers fell on him, Not man for man, but with outnumbering force. Ådip. How could the robber e'er have dared this deed, Unless some bribe from hence had tempted him? Creon. So men might think; but Laios having died, There was no helper for us in our ills. Ådip. What ill then hindered, when your sovereignty Had fallen thus, from searching out the truth? Creon. The Sphinx, with her dark riddle, bade us look At nearer facts, and leave the dim obscure. Ådip. Well, be it mine to track them to their source. Right well hath PhÅbos, and right well hast thou, Shown for the dead your care, and ye shall find, As is most meet, in me a helper true, Aiding at once my country and the God. It is not for the sake of friends remote, But for mine own, that I dispel this pest; For he that slew him, whosoe'er he be, Will wish, perchance, with such a blow to smite Me also. Helping him, I help myself. And now, my children, rise with utmost speed From off these steps, and raise your suppliant boughs; And let another call my people here, The race of Cadmos, and make known that I Will do my taskwork to the uttermost: So, as God wills, we prosper, or we fail. Priest. Rise then, my children, 'twas for this we came, For these good tidings which those lips have brought, And PhÅbos, who hath sent these oracles, Pray that He come to save, and heal our plague. [Exeunt Creon, Priest, and Suppliants, the latter taking their boughs from the altar and bearing them, as they march in procession. Chorus. Enter Chorus of Theban citizens. Stroph. I. O word of Zeus, The oracle, though given by Apollo, is yet the voice of Zeus, of whom Apollo is but the prophet, spokesman. glad-voiced, with what intent From Pytho, bright with gold, Cam'st thou to Thebes, our city of high fame? For lo! I faint for fear, Through all my soul I quiver in suspense, (Hear, Io PÃ¦an! God of Delos, Apollo, born in Delos, passed through Attica to Pytho, his shrine at Delphi. hear!) In brooding dread, what doom, of present growth, Or as the months roll on, thy hand will work; Tell me, O deathless Voice, thou child of golden hope! Antistroph. I. Thee first, Zeus-born Athena, thee I call, Divine and deathless One, And next thy sister, Goddess of our land, Our Artemis, who sits, Queen of our market, on encircled throne; And PhÅbos, the far-darter! O ye Three, The Three namedâAthena, Artemis, PhÅbosâwere the guardian deities of Thebes; but the tendency to bring three names together in one group in oaths and invocations runs through Greek worship generally. Shine on us, and deliver us from ill! If e'er before, when storms of woe oppressed, Ye stayed the fiery tide, O come and help us now! Stroph. II. Ah me, ah me, for sorrows numberless Press on my soul; And all the host is smitten, and our thoughts Lack weapons to resist. For increase fails of fruits of goodly earth, And women sink in childbirth's wailing pangs, And one by one, as flit The swift-winged birds through air, So, flitting to the shore of Him who dwells Down in the darkling West, Pluto, dwelling where the sun sinks into darkness. The symbolism of the West as the region of dead and evil, of the East as that of light and truth, belongs to the earliest parables of nature. Fleeter than mightiest fire, Thou see'st them passing on. Antistroph. II. Yea, numberless are they who perish thus; And on the earth, Still breeding plague, unpitied infants lie, Cast out all ruthlessly; And wives and mothers, grey with hoary age, Some here, some there, by every altar mourn, With woe and sorrow crushed, And chant their wailing plaint. Clear thrills the sense their solemn PÃ¦an cry, And the sad anthem song; Hear, golden child of Zeus, And send us bright-eyed help. Stroph. III. And Ares the destroyer drive away! The Pestilence, previously (v. 27) personified, is now identified with Ares, the God of slaughter, and, as such, the foe of the more benign deities. Who now, though hushed the din Of brazen shield and spear, With fiercest battle-cry Wars on me mightily. Bid him go back in flight, Retreat from this our land, Or to the ocean bed, Where Amphitrite sleeps, Or to that haven of the homeless sea Which sweeps the Thracian shore. The Chorus prays that the pestilence may be driven either to the far western ocean, beyond the pillars of Heracles, the couch of Amphitrite, the bride of Neptune, or to the northern coasts of the Euxine, where Ares was worshipped as the special God of the Thracians. If waning night spares aught, That doth the day assail: Do thou, then, Sire almighty, Wielding the lightning's strength, Blast him with thy dread fiery thunderbolts. Antistroph. III. And thou, Lykeian king, the wolf's dread foe, Fain would I see thy darts From out thy golden bow Go forth invincible, Helping and bringing aid; And with them, winged with fire, The rays of Artemis, With which on Lykian hills, She moveth on her course. And last, O golden-crowned, I call on thee, Named after this our land, Bacchos, as born in Thebes, was known as the Cadmeian king, the BÅotian God, while Thebes took from him the epithet Bacchia. Bacchos, all flushed with wine, With clamour loud and long, Wandering with MÃ¦nads wild, Flashing with blazing torch, Draw near against the God whom all the Gods disown. So, in the Iliad, Ares is, of all the Gods of Olympos, most hateful to Zeus, (v. 890,) as the cause of all strife and slaughter. Ådip. Thou prayest, and for thy prayers, if thou wilt hear My words, and treat the dire disease with skill, Thou shalt find help and respite from thy pain,â My words, which I, a stranger to report, A stranger to the deed, will now declare: For I myself should fail to track it far, Finding no trace to guide my steps aright. But now, as I have joined you since the deed, A citizen with citizens, I speak To all the sons of Cadmos. Lives there one Who knows of Laios, son of Labdacos, The hand that slew him; him I bid to tell His tale to me; and should it chance he shrinks From raking up the charge against himself, Still let him speak; no heavier doom is his Than to depart uninjured from the land; Or, if there be that knows an alien arm As guilty, let him hold his peace no more; I will secure his gain and thanks beside. But if ye hold your peace, if one through fear, Or for himself, or friend, shall hide this thing, What then I purpose let him hear from me. That man I banish, whosoe'er he be, From out this land whose power and throne are mine; And none may give him shelter, none speak to him, Nor join with him in prayers and sacrifice, Nor give him share in holy lustral stream; But all shall thrust him from their homes, declared Our curse and our pollution, as but now The Pythian God's prophetic word has shown: With acts like this, I stand before you here, A helper to the God and to the dead. All this I charge you do, for mine own sake, I follow Schneidewin's arrangement of this portion of the speech. And for the God's, and for this land that pines, Barren and god-deserted. Wrong 'twould be E'en if no voice from heaven had urged us on, That ye should leave the stain of guilt uncleansed, Your noblest chief, your king himself, being slain. Yea, rather, seek and find. And since I reign, Wielding the might his hand did wield before, Filling his couch, and calling his wife mine, Yea, and our offspring too, but for the fate That fell on his, had grown in brotherhood; But now an evil chance on his head swooped; And therefore will I strive my best for him, As for my father, and will go all lengths To seek and find the murderer, him who slew The son of Labdacos, and Polydore, And earlier Cadmos, and Agenor old; Ådipus, as if identifying himself already with the kingly house, goes through the whole genealogy up to the remote ancestor. And for all those who hearken not, I pray The Gods to give them neither fruit of earth, Nor seed of woman, The imprecation agrees almost verbally with the curse of the Amphictyonic councils against sacrilege. but consume their lives With this dire plague, or evil worse than this. And for the man who did the guilty deed, Whether alone her lurks, or leagued with more, I pray that he may waste his life away, For vile deeds vilely dying; and for me, If in my house, I knowing it, he dwells, May every curse I spake on my head fall. And you, the rest, the men from Cadmos sprung, To whom these words approve themselves as good, May Righteousness befriend you, and the Gods, In full accord, dwell with you evermore. Chorus. Since thou hast bound me by a curse, O king, I will speak thus. I neither slew the man, Nor know who slew. To say who did the deed Is quest for Him who sent us on the search. Ådip. Right well thou speak'st, but man's best strength must fail To force the Gods to do the things they will not. Chorus. Fain would I speak the thoughts that second stand. Ådip. Though there be third, shrink not from speaking out. Chorus. One man I know, a prince, whose insight deep Sees clear as princely PhÅbos, and from him, Teiresias, one might learn, O king, the truth. Ådip. That too is done. No loiterer I in this, For I, on Creon's hint, two couriers sent To summon him, and wonder that he comes not. Chorus. Old rumours are there also, dark and dumb. Ådip. And what are they? I weigh the slightest word. Chorus. 'Twas said he died by some chance traveller's hand. Ådip. I, too, heard that. But none the eye-witness sees. Chorus. If yet his soul be capable of awe, Hearing thy curses, he will shrink from them. Ådip. Words fright not him, who doing, knows no fear. Chorus. Well, here is one who'll put him to the proof. For lo! they bring the seer inspired of God, With whom alone of all men, truth abides. Enter Teiresias, blind, and guided by a boy. Ådip. Teiresias! thou whose mind embraceth all, Told or untold, of heaven or paths of earth; Thou knowest, although thou see'st not, what a pest Dwells on us, and we find in thee, O prince, Our one deliverer, yea, our only help. For PhÅbos (if the couriers told thee not) Sent back this word to us, who sent to ask, That this one way was open to escape From this fell plague,âif those who Laios slew, We in our turn discovering should slay, Or drive them forth as exiles from the land. Thou, therefore, grudge not either sign from birds, Or any other path of prophecy; But save the city, save thyself, save me; Save from the curse the dead has left behind; On thee we hang. To use our means, our power, In doing good, is noblest service owned. Teir. Ah me! ah me! how dread is wisdom's gift, When no good issue waiteth on the wise! I knew it all too well, and then forgot, Or else I had not on this journey come. Ådip. What means this? How despondingly thou com'st! Teir. Let me go home! for thus thy lot shalt thou, And I mine own, bear easiest, if thou yield. Ådip. No loyal words thou speak'st, nor true to Thebes Who reared thee, holding back this oracle. Teir. I see thy lips speak words that profit not: And lest I too a like fault should commit ... Ådip. Now, by the Gods, unless thy reason fails, Refuse us not, who all implore thy help. Teir. Ah! Reason fails you all, but ne'er will I Say what thou bidd'st, lest I thy troubles show. Ådip. What mean'st thou, then? Thou know'st and wilt not tell, But wilt betray us, and the state destroy? Teir. I will not pain myself nor thee. Why, then, All vainly question? Thou shalt never know. Ådip. Oh, basest of the base! (for thou would'st stir A heart of stone;) and wilt thou never tell, But still abide relentless and unmoved? Teir. My mood thou blamest, but thou dost not know What dwelleth with thee while thou chidest me. Ådip. And who would not feel anger, hearing words Like those with which thou dost the state insult? Teir. Well! come they will, though I should hold my peace. Ådip. If come they must, thy duty is to speak. Teir. I speak no more. So, if thou wilt, rage on, With every mood of wrath most desperate. Ådip. Yes; I will not refrain, so fierce my wrath, From speaking all my thought. I think that thou Did'st plot the deed, and do it, though the blow Thy hands, it may be, dealt not. Had'st thou seen, I would have said it was thy deed alone. Teir. And has it come to this? I charge thee, hold To thy late edict, and from this day forth Speak not to me, nor yet to these, for thou, Thou art the accursÃ¨d plague-spot of the land. Ådip. Art thou so shameless as to vent such words, And dost thou think to 'scape scot-free for this? Teir. I have escaped. The strength of truth is mine. Ådip. Who prompted thee? This comes not from thine art. Teir. 'Twas thou. Thou mad'st me speak against my will. Ådip. What say'st thou? Speak again, that I may know. Teir. Did'st thou not know before? Or dost thou try me? Ådip. I could not say I knew it. Speak again. Teir. I say thou art the murderer whom thou seek'st. Ådip. Thou shalt not twice revile, and go unharmed. Teir. And shall I tell thee more to stir thy rage? Ådip. Say what thou pleasest. 'Twill be said in vain. Teir. I say that thou, in vilest intercourse With those that dearest are, dost blindly live, Nor see'st the depth of evil thou hast reached. Ådip. And dost thou think to say these things unscathed? Teir. I doubt it not, if truth retain her might. Ådip. That might is not for thee; thou can'st not claim it, Blind in thine ears, thy reason, and thine eyes. Teir. How wretched thou, thus hurling this reproach! Such, all too soon, will all men hurl at thee. Ådip. In one long night thou liv'st, and can'st not hurt, Or me, or any man who sees the light. Teir. 'Tis not thy doom to owe thy fall to me; Apollo is enough, be His the task. Ådip. Are these devices Creon's, or thine own? Teir. It is not Creon harms thee, but thyself. Ådip. O wealth, and sovereignty, and noblest skill Surpassing skill in life so envy-fraught, How great the ill-will dogging all your steps! If for the sake of kingship, which the state Hath given, unasked for, freely in mine hands, Creon the faithful, found my friend throughout, Now seeks with masked attack to drive me forth, And hires this wizard, plotter of foul schemes, A vagrant mountebank, whose sight is clear For pay alone, but in his art stone-blind. Is it not so? When wast thou true seer found? Why, when the monster with her song was here, Spak'st thou no word our countrymen to help? And yet the riddle lay above the ken Of common men, and called for prophet's skill. And this thou show'dst thou had'st not, nor by bird, Nor any God made known; but then I came, I, Ådipus, who nothing know, and slew her, With mine own counsel winning, all untaught By flight of birds. And now thou would'st expel me, And think'st to take thy stand by Creon's throne. But, as I think, both thou and he that plans With thee, will hunt this mischief to your cost; And but that I must think of thee as old, Thou had'st learnt wisdom, suffering what thou plann'st. Chorus. Far as we dare to guess, we think his words, And thine, O Ådipus, in wrath are said. Not such as these we need, but this to see, How best to solve the God's great oracles. Teir. King though thou be, I claim an equal right To make reply. That power, at least, is mine: For I am not thy slave, but Loxias'; The special name of Apollo as the prophetes of Zeus, and therefore the guardian of all seers and prophets. Nor shall I stand on Creon's patronage: And this I say, since thou my blindness mock'st, That thou, though seeing, failest to perceive Thy evil plight, nor where thou liv'st, nor yet With whom thou dwellest. Know'st thou even this, Whence thou art sprung? All ignorant thou sinn'st Against thine own, beneath, and on the earth: And soon a two-edged Curse from sire and mother, With foot of fear, shall chase thee forth from us, Now seeing all things clear, then all things dark. And will not then each creek repeat thy wail, Each valley of KithÃ¦ron echoing ring, When thou discern'st the marriage, fatal port, To which thy prosp'rous voyage brought thy bark? And other ills, in countless multitude, Thou see'st not yet, shall make thy lot as one With sire's and child's. Vent forth thy wrath then loud, On Creon, and my speech. There lives not man Whose life shall waste more wretchedly than thine. Ådip. Can this be longer borne! Away with thee! A curse light on thee! Wilt thou not depart? Wilt thou not turn and from this house go back? Teir. I had not come, had'st thou not called me here. Ådip. I knew not thou would'st speak so foolishly; Else I had hardly fetched thee to my house. Teir. We then, so seems it thee, are fools from birth, But, unto those who gave thee birth, seem wise. [Turns to go. Ådip. [Starting forward.] What? Stay thy foot. What mortal gave me birth? Teir. This day shall give thy birth, and work thy doom. Ådip. What riddles dark and dim thou lov'st to speak. Teir. Yes. But thy skill excels in solving such. Ådip. Scoff thou at that in which thou'lt find me strong. Teir. And yet this same success has worked thy fall. Ådip. I little care, if I have saved the state. Teir. Well, then, I go. Do thou, boy, lead me on! Ådip. Let him lead on. Most hateful art thou near; Thou can'st not pain me more when thou art gone. Teir. I go then, having said the things I came To say. No fear of thee compels me. Thine Is not the power to hurt me. And I say, This man whom thou dost seek with hue-and-cry, As murderer of Laios, he is here, In show an alien sojourner, but in truth A homeborn Theban. No delight to him Will that discovery bring. Blind, having seen, Poor, having rolled in wealth,âhe, with a staff Feeling his way, to a strange land shall go! And to his sons shall he be seen at once Father and brother, and of her who bore him Husband and son, sharing his father's bed, His father's murd'rer. Go thou then within, And brood o'er this, and, if thou find'st me fail, Say that my skill in prophecy is gone. [Exeunt Ådipus and Teiresias. Chorus. Stroph. I. Who was it that the rock oracular Of Delphi spake of, working With bloody hands of all dread deeds most dread? Time is it now for him, Swifter than fastest steed to bend his flight; For, in full armour clad, Upon him darts, with fire And lightning flash, the radiant Son of Zeus, And with Him come in train The dread and awful Powers, The Destinies that fail not of their aim. Antistroph. I. For from Parnassos' heights, enwreathed with snow, Gleaming, but now there shone The oracle that bade us, one and all, Track the unnamed, unknown; For, lo ! he wanders through the forest wild, In caves and over rocks, As strays the mountain bull, In dreary loneliness with dreary tread, Seeking in vain to shun Dread words from central shrine; Delphi, thought of by the Greeks, as Jerusalem was in the middle ages, as the centre of the whole earth. Yet they around him hover, full of life. Stroph. II. Fearfully, fearfully the augur moves me. Nor answering, aye nor no! And what to say I know not, but float on, And hover still in hopes, And fail to scan things present or to come. For not of old , nor now, Learnt I what cause of strife at variance set The old Labdakid race With him, the child and heir of Polybos, Nor can I test the tale, And take my stand against the well-earned fame Of Ådipus, my lord, As champion of the old Labdakid race, For deaths obscure and dark! Antistroph. II. For Zeus and King Apollo, they are wise, And know the hearts of men: But that a seer excelleth me in skill, This is no judgment true; And one man may another's wisdom pass, By wisdom higher still. I, for my part, before the word is plain, Will ne'er assent in blame. Full clear, the wingÃ¨d Maiden-monster came Against him, and he proved, By sharpest test, that he was wise indeed, By all the land beloved, And never, from my heart at least, shall come Words that accuse of guilt. Enter Creon. Creon. I come, ye citizens, as having learnt Our sovereign, Ådipus, accuses me Of dreadful things I cannot bear to hear. For if, in these calamities of ours, He thinks he suffers wrongly at my hands, In word or deed, aught tending to his hurt, I set no value on a life prolonged, While this reproach hangs on me; for its harm Affects not slightly, but is direst shame, If through the town my name as villain rings, By thee and by my friends a villain called. Chorus. But this reproach, it may be, came from wrath All hasty, rather than from calm, clear mind. Creon. And who informed him that the seer, seduced By my devices, spoke his lying words? Chorus. The words were said, but with what mind I know not. Creon. And was it with calm eyes and judgment calm, This charge was brought against my name and fame? Chorus. I cannot say. To what our rulers do I close my eyes. But here he comes himself. Enter Ådipus. Ådip. Ho there! is't thou? And does thy boldness soar So shameless as to come beneath my roof, When thou, 'tis clear, dost plot against my life, And seek'st to rob me of my sovereignty? Is it, by all the Gods, that thou hast seen Or cowardice or folly in my soul, That thou hast laid thy plans? Or thoughtest thou That I should neither see thy sinuous wiles, Nor, knowing, ward them off? This scheme of thine, Is it not wild, backed nor by force nor friends, To seek the power which force and wealth must grasp? Creon. Dost know what thou wilt do? For words of thine Hear like words back, and as thou hearest, judge. Ådip. Cunning of speech art thou. But I am slow Of thee to learn, whom I have found my foe. Creon. Of this, then, first, hear what I have to speak. ... Ådip. But this, then, say not, that thou art not vile. Creon. If that thou thinkest self-willed pride avails, Apart from judgment, know thou art not wise. Ådip. If that thou think'st, thy kinsman injuring, To do it unchastised, thou art not wise. Creon. In this, I grant, thou speakest right; but tell, What form of injury hast thou to endure? Ådip. Did'st thou, or did'st thou not, thy counsel give, Some one to send to fetch this reverend seer? Creon. And even now by that advice I hold! Ådip. How long a time has passed since Laios chanced. ... [Pauses. Creon. Chanced to do what? I understand not yet. Ådip. Since he was smitten with the deadly blow? Creon. The years would measure out a long, long tale. Ådip. And was this seer then practising his art? Creon. Full wise as now, and equal in repute. Ådip. Did he at that time say a word of me? Creon. Not one, while I, at any rate, was by. Ådip. What? Held ye not your quest upon the dead? Creon. Of course we held it, but we nothing heard. Ådip. How was it he, this wise one, spoke not then? Creon. I know not, and, not knowing, hold my peace. Ådip. Thy deed thou know'st, and with clear mind could'st speak! Creon. What is't? I'll not deny it, if I know. Ådip. Were he not leagued with thee he ne'er had talked Of felon deed by me on Laios done. Creon. If he says this, thou know'st it. I of thee Desire to learn, as thou hast learnt of me. Ådip. Learn then; on me no guilt of blood shall rest. Creon. Well, then,âmy sister? dost thou own her wife? Ådip. I cannot meet this question with denial. Creon. Rul'st thou this land in equal right with her? Ådip. Her every wish she doth from me receive. Creon. And am not I co-equal with you twain? Ådip. Yes; and just here thou show'st thyself false friend. Creon. Not so, if thou would'st reason with thyself, As I will reason. First reflect on this; Supposest thou that one would rather choose To reign with fears than sleep untroubled sleep, His power being equal? I, for one, prize less The name of king than deeds of kingly power; And so would all who learn in wisdom's school. Now without fear I have what I desire, At thy hand given. Did I rule, myself, I might do much unwillingly. Why then Should sovereignty exert a softer charm, Than power and might unchequered by a care? I am not yet so cheated by myself, As to desire aught else but honest gain. Now all men hail me, every one salutes, Now they who seek thy favour court my smiles, For on this hinge does all their fortune turn. Why then should I leave this to hunt for that? My mind, retaining reason, ne'er could act The villain's part. I was not born to love Such thoughts, nor join another in the act; And as a proof of this, go thou thyself, And ask at Pytho whether I brought back, In very deed, the oracles I heard. And if thou find me plotting with the seer, In common concert, not by one decree, But two, thine own and mine, put me to death. But charge me not with crime on shadowy proof; For neither is it just, in random thought, The bad to count as good, nor good as bad; For to thrust out a friend of noble heart, Is like the parting with the life we love. And this in time thou'lt know, for time alone Makes manifest the righteous. Of the vile Thou may'st detect the vileness in a day. Chorus. To one who fears to fall, his words seem good; O king, swift counsels are not always safe. Ådip. But when a man is swift in wily schemes, Swift must I be to baffle plot with plot; And if I stand and wait, he wins the day, And all my state to rack and ruin goes. Creon. What seek'st thou, then? to drive me from the land? Ådip. Not so. I seek thy death, not banishment. Creon. When thou show'st first what grudge I bear to thee. Ådip. And say'st thou this defying, yielding not? Creon. I see your mind is gone. Ådip. My right I mind. Creon. Mine has an equal claim. Ådip. Nay, thou art vile. Creon. And if thy mind is darkened. ...? Ådip. Still obey! Creon. Nay, not a tyrant king. Ådip. O country mine! Creon. That country, too, is mine, not thine alone. Chorus. Cease, O my princes! In good time I see Jocasta coming hither from the house; And it were well with her to hush this brawl. Enter Jocasta. Joc. Why, O ye wretched ones, this strife of tongues Raise ye in your unwisdom, nor are shamed, Our country suffering, private griefs to stir? Come thou within; and thou, O Creon, go; Bring not a trifling sore to mischief great! Creon. My sister! Ådipus thy husband claims The right to do me one of two great wrongs, To thrust me from my fatherland, or slay me. Ådip. 'Tis even so, for I have found him, wife, Against my life his evil wiles devising. Creon. May I ne'er prosper, but accursÃ¨d die, If I have done the things he says I did! Joc. Oh, by the Gods, believe him, Ådipus! Respect his oath, which calls the Gods to hear; And reverence me, and these who stand by thee. Chorus. Hearken, my king! be calmer, I implore! Ådip. What wilt thou that I yield? Chorus. Oh, have respect To one not weak before, who now is strong In this his oath. Ådip. And know'st thou what thou ask'st? Chorus. I know right well. Ådip. Say on, then, what thou wilt. Chorus. Hurl not to shame, on grounds of mere mistrust, The friend on whom no taint of evil hangs. Ådip. Know then that, seeking this, thou seek'st, in truth, To work my death, or else my banishment. Chorus. Nay, by the Sun-God, Helios, chief of Gods! Helios, specially invoked as the giver of light, discerning and making manifest all hidden things. May I, too, die, of God and man accursed, If I wish aught like this! But on my soul, Our wasting land dwells heavily; ills on ills Still coming, new upon the heels of old. Ådip. Let him depart then, even though I die, Or from my country be thrust forth in shame: Thy face, not his, I view with pitying eye; For him, where'er he be, is nought but hate. Creon. Thou'rt loth to yield, 'twould seem, and wilt be vexed When this thy wrath is over: moods like thine Are fitly to themselves most hard to bear. Ådip. Wilt thou not go, and leave me? Creon. I will go, By thee misjudged, but known as just by these. [Exit. Chorus. Why, lady, art thou slow to lead him in? Joc. I fain would learn how this sad chance arose. Chorus. Blind haste of speech there was, and wrong will sting. Joc. From both of them? Chorus. Yea, both. Joc. And what said each? Chorus. Enough for me, enough, our land laid low, It seems, to leave the quarrel where it stopped. Ådip. See'st thou, thou good in counsel, what thou dost, Slighting my cause, and toning down thy zeal? Chorus. My chief, not once alone I spoke, Unwise, unapt for wisdom should I seem, Were I to turn from thee aside, Who, when my country rocked in storm, Did'st right her course. Ah! if thou can'st, Steer her well onward now. Joc. Tell me, my king, what cause of fell debate Has bred this discord, and provoked thy soul. Ådip. Thee will I tell, for thee I honour more Than these. 'Twas Creon and his plots against me. Joc. Say then, if clearly thou can'st tell the strife. Ådip. He says that I am Laios' murderer. Joc. Of his own knowledge, or by some one taught? Ådip. A scoundrel seer suborning. For himself, He takes good care to free his lips from blame. Joc. Leave now thyself, and all thy thoughts of this, And list to me, and learn how little skill In art prophetic mortal man may claim; And of this truth I'll give thee one short proof. There came to Laios once an oracle, (I say not that it came from PhÅbos' self, But from his servants,) that his fate was fixed By his son's hand to fallâhis own and mine; And him, so rumour runs, a robber band Of aliens slay, where meet the three great roads. Nor did three days succeed the infant's birth, Before, by other hands, he cast him forth, Piercing his ancles, on a lonely hill. Here, then, Apollo failed to make the boy His father's murderer; nor by his son's hands, Doom that he dreaded, did our Laios die; Such things divining oracles proclaimed; Therefore regard them not. Whate'er the God Desires to search He will himself declare. Ådip. [Trembling.] Ah, as but now I heard thee speak, my queen, Strange whirl of soul, and rush of thoughts o'ercome me. Joc. What vexing care bespeaks this sudden change? Ådip. I thought I heard thee say that Laios fell, Smitten to death, where meet the three great roads. Joc. So was it said, and still the rumours hold. Ådip. Where was the spot in which this matter passed? Joc. They call the country Phocis, and the roads The meeting place of the three roads is now the site of a decayed Turkish village, the Stavrodrom of Mparpanas. In Ãschylos (Fragm. 160), the scene of the murder was laid at PotniÃ¦, on the road between Thebes and PlatÃ¦a. As the name indicates, the Erinnyes were worshipped there. From Delphi and from Daulia there converge. Ådip. And what the interval of time since then? Joc. But just before thou camest to possess And rule this land the tidings reached our city. Ådip. Great Zeus! what fate hast thou decreed for me? Joc. What thought is this, my Ådipus, of thine? Ådip. Ask me not yet, but Laios, ... tell of him, His build, his features, and his years of life. Joc. Tall was he, and the white hairs snowed his head, And in his form not much unlike to thee. Ådip. Woe, woe is me! so seems it I have plunged All blindly into curses terrible. Joc. What sayest thou? I fear to look at thee. Ådip. I tremble lest the seer has seen indeed: But thou can'st clear it, answering yet once more. Joc. And I too fear, yet what thou ask'st I'll tell. Ådip. Went he in humble guise, or with a troop Of spearmen, as becomes a man that rules? Joc. Five were they altogether, and of them One was a herald, and one chariot bore him. Ådip. Woe! woe! 'tis all too clear. And who was he That told these tidings to thee, O my queen? Joc. A servant who alone escaped with life. Ådip. And does he chance to dwell among us now? Joc. Not so; for from the time when he returned, And found thee bearing sway, and Laios dead, He, at my hand, a suppliant, implored This boon, to send him to the distant fields To feed his flocks, as far as possible From this our city. And I sent him forth; For though a slave, he might have claimed yet more. Ådip. Ah! could we fetch him quickly back again! Joc. That may well be. But why dost thou wish this? Ådip. I fear, O queen, that words best left unsaid Have passed these lips, and therefore wish to see him. Joc. Well, he shall come. But some small claim have I, O King, to learn what touches thee with woe. Ådip. Thou shalt not fail to learn it, now that I Have gone so far in bodings. Whom should I More than to thee tell all the passing chance? I had a father, Polybos of Corinth, And Merope of Doris was my mother, And I was held in honour by the rest Who dwelt there, till this accident befel, Worthy of wonder, of the heat unworthy It roused within me. Thus it chanced: A man At supper, in his cups, with wine o'ertaken, Reviles me as a spurious changeling boy; And I, sore vexÃ¨d, hardly for that day Restrained myself. And when the morrow came I went and charged my father and my mother With what I thus had heard. They heaped reproach On him who stirred the matter, and I soothed My soul with what they told me; yet it teased, Still vexing more and more; and so I went, Unknown to them, to Pytho, and the God Sent me forth shamed, unanswered in my quest; And other things He spake, dread, dire, and dark, That I should join in wedlock with my mother, Beget a brood that men should loathe to look at, Be murderer of the father that begot me. And, hearing this, I straight from Corinth fled, The stars thenceforth the land-marks of my way, And fled where never more mine eyes might see The shame of those dire oracles fulfilled; And as I went I reached the spot where he, This king, thou tell'st me, met the fatal blow. And now, O lady, I will tell the truth. Wending my steps that way where three roads meet, There met me first a herald, and a man Like him thou told'st of, riding on his car, Drawn by young colts. With rough and hasty force They drove me from the road,âthe driver first, And that old man himself; and then in rage I strike the driver, who had turned me back. And when the old man sees it, watching me As by the chariot-side I passed, he struck My forehead with a double-pointed goad. But we were more than quits, for in a trice With this right hand I struck him with my staff, And he rolls backward from his chariot's seat. And then I slay them all. And if it chance That Laios and this stranger are akin, What man more wretched than this man who speaks? What man more harassed by the vexing Gods? He whom none now, or alien, or of Thebes, May welcome to their house, or speak to him, But thrust him forth an exile. And 'twas I, None other, who against myself proclaimed These curses. And the bed of him that died I with my hands, by which he fell, defile. Am I not born to evil, all unclean? If I must flee, yet still in flight my doom Is never more to see the friends I love, Nor tread my country's soil; or else to bear The guilt of incest, and my father slay, Yea, Polybos, who begat and brought me up. Would not a man say right who said that here Some cruel God was pressing hard on me? Not that, not that, at least, thou Presence, pure And awful, of the Gods; may I ne'er look On such a day as that, but far away Depart unseen from all the haunts of men, Before such great pollution comes on me. Chorus. We, too, O king, are grieved, yet hope thou on, Till thou hast asked the man who then was by. Ådip. And this indeed is all the hope I have, Waiting until that shepherd-slave appear. Joc. And when he comes, what ground for hope is there? Ådip. I'll tell thee. Should he now repeat the tale Thou told'st me, I, at least, stand free from guilt. Joc. What special word was that thou heard'st from me? Ådip. Thou said'st he told that robbers slew his lord, And should he give their number as the same Now as before, it was not I who slew him, For one man could not be the same as many. But if he speak of one man, all alone, Then, all too plain, the deed cleaves fast to me. Joc. But know, the thing was said, and clearly said, And now he cannot from his word draw back. Not I alone, but the whole city, heard it; And should he now retract his former tale, Not then, my husband, will he rightly show The death of Laios, who, as Loxias told, By my son's hands should die; and yet, poor boy, He killed him not, but perished long ago. So I, at least, for all their oracles, Will never more cast glance or here, or there. Ådip. Thou reasonest well. Yet send a messenger To fetch that peasant. Be not slack in this. Joc. I will make haste. But let us now go in; I would do nothing that displeaseth thee. [Exeunt. Chorus. Stroph. I. O that 'twere mine to keep An awful purity, In words and deeds whose laws on high are set Through heaven's clear Ã¦ther spread, Whose birth Olympos boasts, Their one, their only sire, Whom man's frail flesh begat not, Nor in forgetfulness Shall lull to sleep of death; In them our God is great, In them He grows not old for evermore. Antistroph. I. But pride begets the mood Of wanton, tyrant power; Pride filled with many thoughts, yet filled in vain, Untimely, ill-advised, Scaling the topmost height, Falls to the abyss of woe, Where step that profiteth It seeks in vain to take. I ask our God to stay The labours never more That work our country's good; I will not cease to call on God for aid. Stroph. II. But if there be who walketh haughtily, In action or in speech, Whom Righteousness herself has ceased to awe, Who shrines of Gods reveres not, An evil fate be his, (Fit meed for all his evil boastfulness;) Unless he gain his gains more righteously, And draweth back from deeds of sacrilege, Nor lays rash hand upon the holy things, By man inviolable: Who now, if such things be, Will boast that he can guard His soul from darts of wrath? If deeds like these are held in high repute, What profit is't for me To raise my choral strain? Antistroph. II. No longer will I go in pilgrim's guise, To yon all holy place, Earth's central shrine, nor AbÃ¦'s temple old, Nor to Olympia's fane, The central shrine is, as in 480, Delphi, where a white oval stone was supposed to be the very centre, or omphalos of the earth. At AbÃ¦, in Phocis, was an oracle of Apollo, believed to be older than that of Delphi. In Olympia, the priests of Zeus divined from the clearness or dimness of the fire upon the altar. Unless these things shall stand In sight all men, tokens clear from God. But, O thou sovereign Ruler! if that name, O Zeus, belongs to thee, who reign'st o'er all, Let not this trespass hide itself from thee, Or thine undying sway; For now they set at nought The worn-out oracles, That Laios heard of old, And king Apollo's wonted worship flags, And all to wreck is gone The homage due to God. Enter Jocasta, followed by Attendants. Joc. Princes of this our land, across my soul There comes the thought to go from shrine to shrine Of all the Gods, these garlands in my hand, And waving incense; for our Ådipus Vexes his soul too wildly with all woes, And speaks not as a man should speak who scans New issues by experience of the old, But hangs on every breath that tells of fear. And since I find that my advice avails not, To thee, Lykeian King, Apollo, first I come,âfor thou art nearest,âsuppliant With these devotions, trusting thou wilt work Some way of healing for us, free from guilt; For now we shudder, all of us, seeing him, The good ship's pilot, stricken down with fear. Enter Messenger. Mess. May I inquire of you, O strangers, where To find the house of Ådipus the king, And, above all, where he is, if ye know? Chorus. This is the house, and he, good sir, within, And here stands she, the mother of his children. Mess. Good fortune be with her and all her kin, Being, as she is, his true and honoured wife. Joc. Like fortune be with thee, my friend. Thy speech, So kind, deserves no less. But tell me why Thou comest, what thou hast to ask or tell. Mess. Good news to thee, and to thy husband, lady. Joc. What is it, then? and who has sent thee here? Mess. I come from Corinth, and the news I'll tell May give thee joy. How else? Yet thou may'st grieve. Joc. What is the news that has this twofold power? Mess. The citizens that on the Isthmus dwell Will make him sovereign. So the rumour ran. Joc. What! Does old Polybos hold his own no more? Mess. Nay, nay. Death holds him in his sepulchre. Joc. What say'st thou? Polybos, thy king, is dead? Mess. If I speak false, I bid you take my life. Joc. Go, maiden, at thy topmost speed, and tell Thy master this. Now, oracles of Gods, Where are ye now? Long since my Ådipus Fled, fearing lest his hand should slay the man; And now he dies by fate, and not by him. Enter Ådipus. Ådip. Mine own Jocasta, why, O dearest one, Why hast thou sent to fetch me from the house? Joc. List this man's tale, and, when thou hearest, see The plight of those the God's dread oracles. Ådip. Who then is this, and what has he to tell? Joc. He comes from Corinth, and he brings thee word That Polybos thy father lives no more. Ådip. What say'st thou, friend? Tell me thy tale thyself. Mess. If I must needs report the story clear, Know well that he has gone the way of death. Ådip. Was it by plot, or chance of some disease? Mess. An old man's frame a little stroke lays low. Ådip. By some disease, 'twould seem, he met his death? Mess. Yes, that, and partly worn by lingering age. Ådip. Ha! ha! Why now, my queen, should we regard The Pythian hearth oracular, or birds In mid-air crying? The âPythian hearth,â with special reference to the apparent failure of the Delphic oracle; âbirds,â to that of the auguries of Teiresias. By their auguries, I was to slay my father. And he dies, And the grave hides him; and I find myself Handling no sword; ... unless for love of me He pined away, and so I caused his death. So Polybos is gone, and bears with him, In Hades 'whelmed, those worthless oracles. Joc. Did I not tell thee this long time ago? Ådip. Thou did'st, but I was led away by fears. Joc. Dismiss them, then, for ever from thy thoughts! Ådip. And yet that âincest;â must I not fear that? Joc. Why should we fear, when chance rules everything, And foresight of the future there is none; 'Tis best to live at random, as one can. But thou, fear not that marriage with thy mother: Many ere now have dreamt of things like this, But who cares least about them bears life best. Ådip. Right well thou speakest all things, save that she Still lives that bore me, and I can but fear, Seeing that she lives, although thou speakest well. Joc. And yet great light comes from thy father's grave. Ådip. Great light I own; yet while she lives I fear. Mess. Who is this woman about whom ye fear? Ådip. 'Tis Merope, old sir, who lived with Polybos. Mess. And what leads you to think of her with fear? Ådip. A fearful oracle, my friend, from God. Mess. Can'st tell it? or must others ask in vain? Ådip. Most readily: for Loxias said of old That I should with my mother wed, and then With mine own hands should spill my father's blood. And therefore Corinth long ago I left, And journeyed far, right prosperously I own;â And yet 'tis sweet to see one's parents' face. Mess. And did this fear thy steps to exile lead? Ådip. I did not wish to take my father's life. Mess. Why, then, O king, did I, with good-will come, Not free thee from this fear that haunts thy soul? Ådip. Yes, and for this thou shalt have worthy thanks. Mess. For this, indeed, I chiefly came to thee; That I on thy return might prosper well. Ådip. And yet I will not with a parent meet. Mess. 'Tis clear, my son, thou know'st not what thou dost. Ådip. What is't? By all the Gods, old man, speak out. Mess. If 'tis for them thou fearest to return. ... Ådip. I fear lest PhÅbos prove himself too true. Mess. Is it lest thou should'st stain thy soul through them? Ådip. This self-same fear, old man, for ever haunts me. Mess. And know'st thou not there is no cause for fear? Ådip. Is there no cause if I was born their son? Mess. None is there. Polybos was nought to thee. Ådip. What say'st thou? Did not Polybos beget me? Mess. No more than he thou speak'st to; just as much. Ådip. How could a father's claim become as nought? Mess. Well, neither he begat thee nor did I. Ådip. Why then did he acknowledge me as his? Mess. He at my hands received thee as a gift. Ådip. And could he love another's child so much? Mess. Yes; for his former childlessness wrought on him. Ådip. And gav'st thou me as foundling or as bought? Mess. I found thee in KithÃ¦ron's shrub-grown hollow. Ådip. And for what cause did'st travel thitherwards? Mess. I had the charge to tend the mountain flocks. Ådip. Wast thou a shepherd, then, and seeking hire? Mess. E'en so, my son, and so I saved thee then. Ådip. What evil plight then did'st thou find me in? Mess. The sinews of thy feet would tell that tale. Ådip. Ah, me! why speak'st thou of that ancient wrong? Mess. I freed thee when thy insteps both were pierced. Ådip. A foul disgrace I had in swaddling clothes. Mess. Thus from this chance there came the name thou bearest. Ådip. [Starting.] Who gave the name, my father or my mother? Mess. I know not. He who gave thee better knows. Ådip. Did'st thou then take me from another's hand, Not finding me thyself? Mess. Not I, indeed; Another shepherd made a gift of thee. Ådip. Who was he? Know'st thou how to point him out? Mess. They called him one of those that Laios owned. Ådip. Mean'st thou the former sovereign of this land? Mess. E'en so. He fed the flocks of him thou nam'st. Ådip. And is he living still that I might see him? Mess. You, his own countrymen, should know that best. Ådip. Is there of you who stand and listen here One who has known the shepherd that he tells of, Or seeing him upon the hills or here? If so, declare it; 'tis full time to know. Chorus. I think that this is he whom from the fields But now thou soughtest. But Jocasta here Could tell thee this with surer word than I. Ådip. Think'st thou, my queen, the man whom late we sent for Is one with him of whom this stranger speaks? Joc. [With forced calmness.] Whom did he speak of? Care not thou for it, Nor even wish to keep his words in mind. Ådip. I cannot fail, once getting on the scent, To track at last the secret of my birth. Joc. Ah, by the Gods, if that thou valuest life Inquire no more. My misery is enough. Ådip. Take heart; though I should prove thrice base-born slave, Born of thrice base-born mother, thou art still Free from all stain. Joc. Yet, I implore thee, pause! Yield to my counsels, do not do this deed. Ådip. I may not yield, nor fail to search it out. Joc. And yet best counsels give I, for thy good. Ådip. What thou call'st best has long been grief to me. Joc. May'st thou ne'er know, ill-starred one, who thou art! Ådip. Will some one bring that shepherd to me here? Leave her to glory in her high descent. Joc. Woe! woe! ill-fated one! my last word this, This only, and no more for evermore. [Rushes out. Chorus. Why has thy queen, O Ådipus, gone forth In her wild sorrow rushing? Much I fear Lest from such silence evil deeds burst out. Ådip. Burst out what will; I seek to know my birth, Low though it be, and she perhaps is shamed (For, like a woman, she is proud of heart) At thoughts of my low birth; but I, who count Myself the child of Fortune, fear no shame; My mother she, and she has prospered me. And so the months that span my life have made me Both low and high; but whatsoe'er I be, Such as I am I am, and needs must on To fathom all the secret of my birth. Chorus. Stroph. If the seer's gift be mine, Or skill in counsel wise, Thou, O KithÃ¦ron, by Olympos high, When next our full moon comes, Shalt fail not to resound With cry that greets thee, fellow-citizen, Mother and nurse of Ådipus; And we will on thee weave our choral dance, As bringing to our princes glad good news. Hail, hail! O PhÅbos, grant that what we do May meet thy favouring smile. Antistroph. Who was it bore thee, child, The Chorus, thinking only of the wonder of Ådipus's birth, plays with the conjecture that he is the offspring of the Gods, of Pan, the God of the hills, or Apollo, the prophet God, or Hermes, worshipped on Kyllene in Arcadia; or Bacchos, roaming on the highest peaks of Parnassos. The Heliconian nymphs are, of course, the Muses. Of Nymphs whose years are long, Or drawing near the mighty Father, Pan, Who wanders o'er the hills, Or Loxias' paramour, Who loves the high lawns of the pasturing flocks? Or was it He who rules Kyllene's height; or did the Bacchic god, Whose dwelling is upon the mountain peaks, Receive thee, gift of Heliconian nymphs, With whom He loves to sport? Ådip. If I must needs conjecture, who as yet Ne'er met the man, I think I see the shepherd, Whom this long while we sought for. In his age He this man matches. And I see besides, My servants bring him. Thou perchance can'st speak From former knowledge yet more certainly. Chorus. I know him, king, be sure; for this man stood, If any, known as Laios' herdsman true. Enter Shepherd. Ådip. Thee first I ask, Corinthian stranger, say, Is this the man? Mess. The very man thou seek'st. Ådip. Ho there! old man. Come hither, look on me, And tell me all. Did Laios own thee once? Shep. His slave I was, not bought, but reared at home. Ådip. What was thy work, or what thy mode of life? Shep. Near all my life I followed with the flock. Ådip. And in what regions did'st thou chiefly dwell? Shep. Now 'twas KithÃ¦ron, now on neighbouring fields. Ådip. Know'st thou this man? Did'st ever see him there? Shep. What did he do? Of what man speakest thou? Ådip. This man now present. Did ye ever meet? Shep. I cannot say off-hand from memory. Mess. No wonder that, my lord. But I'll remind him Right well of things forgotten. Well I know He needs must know when on KithÃ¦ron's fields, He with a double flock, and I with one, I was his neighbour during three half years, From springtide till Arcturos rose; and I In winter to mine own fold drove my flocks, And he to those of Laios. [To Shepherd.] Answer me, Speak I, or speak I not, the thing that was? Shep. Thou speak'st the truth, although long years have passed. Mess. Come, then, say on. Dost know thou gav'st me once A boy, that I might rear him as my child? Shep. What means this? Wherefore askest thou of that? Mess. Here stands he, fellow! that same tiny boy. Shep. A curse befall thee! Wilt not hold thy tongue? Ådip. Rebuke him not, old man; thy words need more The language of rebuker than do his. Shep. Say, good my lord, what fault do I commit? Ådip. This, that thou tell'st not of the child he asks for. Shep. Yes, for he nothing knows, and wastes his pains. Ådip. For favour thou speak'st not, but shalt for pain. ... [Strikes him. Shep. By all the Gods, hurt not an old man weak. Ådip. Will no one bind his hands behind his back? Sc., Will no one scourge him at my command, and make him confess? Shep. Oh wretched me! And what then wilt thou learn? Ådip. Gav'st thou this man the boy of whom he asks? Shep. I gave him. Would that I that day had died Ådip. Soon thou wilt come to that if thou speak'st wrong. Shep. Nay, much more shall I perish if I speak. Ådip. This fellow, as it seems, would tire us out. Shep. Not so. I said long since I gave it him. Ådip. Whence came it? Was the child thine own or not? Shep. Mine own 'twas not, from some one else I had it. Ådip. Which of our people, or from out what home? Shep. Oh, by the Gods, my master, ask no more! Ådip. Thou diest if I question this again. Shep. Some one it was of Laios' household born. Ådip. Was it a slave, or some one kin to him? Shep. Ah me, I stand upon the very brink Where most I dread to speak. Ådip. And I to hear: And yet I needs must hear it, come what may. Shep. The boy was said to be his son; but she, Thy queen within, could tell the whole truth best. Ådip. What! was it she who gave it? Shep. Yea, O king! Ådip. And to what end? Shep. To make away with it. Ådip. And dared a mother ...? Shep. Auguries dark she feared. Ådip. What were they? Shep. E'en that he his sire should kill. Ådip. Why then did'st thou to this old man resign him? Shep. I pitied him, O master, and I thought That he would bear him to another land, Whence he himself had come. But him he saved For direst evil. For if thou be he Whom this man speaks of, thou art evil-starred. Ådip. Woe! woe! woe! woe! all cometh clear at last. O light, may this my last glance be on thee, Who now am seen owing my birth to those To whom I ought not, and with whom I ought not In wedlock living, whom I ought not slaying. [Exit. Chorus. Stroph. I. Ah, race of mortal men, How as a thing of nought I count ye, though ye live; For who is there of men That more of blessing knows, Than just a little while To seem to prosper well, And, having seemed, to fall? With thee as pattern given, Thy destiny, e'en thine, Ill-fated Ådipus, I count nought human blest. Antistroph. I. For he, with wondrous skill, Taking his aim, did hit Success, in all things blest; And did, O Zeus! destroy The Virgin with claws bent, And sayings wild and dark; And against many deaths A tower and strong defence Did for my country rise: And so thou king art named, With highest glory crowned, Ruling in mighty Thebes. Stroph. II. And now, who lives than thou more miserable? Who equals thee in wild woes manifold, In shifting turns of life? Ah, noble one, our Ådipus! For whom the same wide harbour Sufficed for sire and son, In marriage rites to enter: Ah how, ah, wretched one, How could thy father's bed Receive thee, and so long, Even till now, be dumb? Antistroph. II. Time, who sees all things, he hath found thee out, Against thy will, and long ago condemned The wedlock none may wed, Begetter and begotten. Ah, child of Laios! would I ne'er had seen thy face! I mourn with wailing lips, Mourn sore exceedingly. 'Tis simplest truth to say, By thee from death I rose, By thee in death I sleep. Enter Second Messenger. Sec. Mess. Ye chieftains, honoured most in this our land, What deeds ye now will hear of, what will see, How great a wailing will ye raise, if still Ye truly love the house of Labdacos! For sure I think that neither Istros' stream Nor Phasis' floods could purify this house, Istros as the great river of Europe, Phasis of Asia. Such horrors does it hold. But soon 'twill show Evils self-chosen, not without free choice: These self-sought sorrows ever pain men most. Chorus. The ills we knew before lacked nothing meet For plaint and moaning. Now, what add'st thou more? Sec. Mess. Quickest for me to speak, and thee to learn; Our sacred queen Jocasta,âshe is dead. Chorus. Ah, crushed with many sorrows! How and why? Sec. Mess. Herself she slew. The worst of all that passed I must omit, for none were there to see. Yet, far as memory suffers me to speak, That sorrow-stricken woman's end I'll tell; For when to passion yielding, on she passed Within the porch, straight to the couch she rushed, Her bridal bed, with both hands tore her hair, And as she entered, dashing through the doors, Calls on her Laios, dead long years ago, Remembering that embrace of long ago, Which brought him death, and left to her who bore, With his own son a hateful motherhood. And o'er her bed she wailed, where she had borne Spouse to her spouse, and children to her child; And how she perished after this I know not; For Ådipus struck in with woeful cry, And we no longer looked upon her fate, But gazed on him as to and fro he rushed. For so he raves, and asks us for a sword, Wherewith to smite the wife that wife was none, The womb polluted with accursÃ¨d births, Himself, his children,âso, as thus he raves, Some spirit shows her to him, (none of us Who stood hard by had done so): with a shout Most terrible, as some one led him on, Through the two gates he leapt, and from the wards He slid the hollow bolt, and rushes in; And there we saw his wife had hung herself, By twisted cords suspended. When her form He saw, poor wretch! with one wild, fearful cry, The twisted rope he loosens, and she fell, Ill-starred one, on the ground. Then came a sight Most fearful. Tearing from her robe the clasps, All chased with gold, with which she decked herself, He with them struck the pupils of his eyes, With words like theseââBecause they had not seen What ills he suffered and what ills he did, They in the dark should look, in time to come, On those whom they ought never to have seen, Nor know the dear ones whom he fain had known.â With such like wails, not once or twice alone, Raising his eyes, he smote them, and the balls, All bleeding, stained his cheek, nor poured they forth Gore drops slow trickling, but the purple shower Fell fast and full, a pelting storm of blood. Such were the ills that sprang from both of them, Not on one only, wife and husband both. His ancient fortune, which he held of old, Was truly fortune; but for this day's doom Wailing and woe, and death and shame, all forms That man can name of evil, none have failed. Chorus. What rest from suffering hath the poor wretch now? Sec. Mess. He calls to us to ope the bolts, and show To all in Thebes his father's murderer, His mother's. ... Foul and fearful were the words He spoke; I dare not speak them. Then he said That he would cast himself adrift, nor stay At home accursÃ¨d, as himself had cursed. Some stay he surely needs, or guiding hand, For greater is the ill than he can bear, And this he soon will show thee, for the bolts Of the two gates are opening, and thou'lt see A sight to touch e'en hatred's self with pity. The doors of the Palace are thrown open, and Ådipus is seen within. Chorus. Oh, fearful sight for men to look upon! Most fearful of all woes I hitherto have known! What madness strange Has come on thee, thou wretched one? What Power with one fell swoop, Ills heaping upon ills, Than greatest greater yet, Has marked thee for its prey? Woe! woe! thou doomed one, wishing much to ask, And much to learn, and much to gaze into, I cannot look on thee, So terrible the sight! Ådip. Ah, woe! ah, woe! ah, woe! Woe for my misery! Where am I wandering in my utter woe? Where floats my voice in air? Dread Power, with crushing might Thou leaped'st on my head. Chorus. Yea, with dread doom nor sight nor speech may bear. Ådip. O cloud of darkness, causing one to shrink, That onward sweeps with dread ineffable, Resistless, borne along by evil blast, Woe, woe, and woe again! How through me darts the throb these clasps have caused, And memory of my ills. Chorus. And who can wonder that in such dire woes Thou mournest doubly, bearing twofold ills? Ådip. Ah, friend, Thou only keepest by me, faithful found, Nor dost the blind one slight. Woe, woe, For thou escap'st me not; I clearly know, Though all is dark, at least that voice of thine. Chorus. O man of fearful deeds, how could'st thou bear Thine eyes to outrage? What Power stirred thee to it? Ådip. Apollo, oh, my friends, the God, Apollo, Who worketh out all these, my bitter woes; Yet no man's hand but mine has smitten them. What need for me to see, When nothing's left that's sweet to look upon? Chorus. Too truly dost thou speak the thing that is. Ådip. Yea, what remains to see, Or what to love, or hear, With any touch of joy? Lead me away, my friends, with utmost speed Lead me away, the foul polluted one, Of all men most accursed, Most hateful to the Gods. Chorus. Ah, wretched one, alike in soul and doom, I fain could wish that I had never knwon thee. Ådip. Ill fate be his who from the fetters freed The child upon the hills, And rescued me from death, And saved me,âthankless boon! Ah! had I died but then, Nor to my friends nor me had been such woe. Chorus. I, too, could fain wish that. Ådip. Yes; then I had not been My father's murderer: Nor had men pointed to me as the man Wedded with her who bore him. But now all godless, born of impious stock, In incest joined with her who gave me birth;â Yea, if there be an evil worse than all, It falls on Ådipus! Chorus. I may not say that thou art well-advised, For better wert thou dead than living blind. Ådip. Persuade me not, nor counsel give to show That what I did was not the best to do. I know not with what eyes, in Hades dark, To look on mine own father or my mother, When I against them both, alas! have done Deeds for which strangling were too light a doom. My children's face, forsooth, was sweet to see, Their birth being what it was; nay, nay, not so To these mine eyes, nor yet this, nor tower, Nor sacred shrines of Gods whence I, who stood Most honoured one in Thebes, myself have banished, Commanding all to thrust the godless forth, Him whom the Gods do show accursed, the stock Of Laios old. And could I dare to look, Such dire pollution fixing on myself, And meet these face to face? Not so, not so. Yea, if I could but stop the stream of sound, And dam mine ears against it, I would do it, Sealing my carcase vile, that I might live Both blind, and hearing nothing. Sweet 'twould be To keep my soul beyond the reach of ills. Why, O KithÃ¦ron, did'st thou shelter me, Nor kill me out of hand? I had not shown, In that case, all men whence I drew my birth. O Polybos, and Corinth, and the home Of old called mine, how strange a growth ye reared, All fair outside, all rotten at the core; For vile I stand, descended from the vile. Ye threefold roads and thickets half concealed, The copse, the narrow pass where three ways meet, Which at my hands did drink my father's blood, Remember ye, what deeds I did in you, What, hither come, I did?âO marriage rites That gave me birth, and, having borne me, gave To me in turn an offspring, and ye showed Fathers, and sons, and brothers, all in one, Mothers, and wives, and daughters, hateful names, All foulest deeds that men have ever done. But, since, where deeds are evil, speech is wrong, With utmost speed, by all the Gods, or slay me, Or drive me forth, or hide me in the sea, Where never more your eyes may look on me. Come, scorn ye not to touch a wretch like me, But hearken; fear ye not; no soul save me Can bear the burden of my countless ills. But ye, if ye have lost your sense of shame For mortal men, yet reverence the light Of him, our King, the Sun-God, source of life, Nor sight so foul expose unveiled to view, Which neither earth, nor shower from heaven, nor light, Can see and welcome. But with utmost speed Convey me in; for nearest kin alone Can meetly see and hear their kindred's ills. I follow Schneidewin in transferring the last lines from Creon (after 1430) to Ådipus. Chorus. The man for what thou need'st is come in time, Creon, to counsel, and to act, for now He in thy stead is left our state's one guide. The two sons of Ådipus, Polyneikes and Eteocles, the Chorus thinks of as too young to reign. Ådip. Ah, me! what language shall I hold to him, What trust at his hands claim? In all the past I showed myself to him most vile and base. Enter Creon. Creon. I have not come, O Ådipus, to scorn, Nor to reproach thee for thy former crimes. Ådip. Oh, by the Gods! since thou, beyond my hopes, Dost come all noble unto me all base, One favour grant. I seek thy good, not mine. Creon. And what request seek'st thou so wistfully? Ådip. Cast me with all thy speed from out this land, Where nevermore a man may speak to me! Creon. Be sure, I would have done so, but I wished To learn what now the God will bid us do. Ådip. The oracle was surely clear enough That I the parricide, the pest, should die. Creon. So ran the words. But in our present need 'Tis better to learn surely what to do. Ådip. And will ye ask for one so vile as I? Creon. Yea, thou, too, now would'st trust the voice of God. Ådip. And this I charge thee, yea, and supplicate; For her within, provide what tomb thou wilt, For for thine own most meetly thou wilt care; But never let this city of my fathers Be sentenced to receive me as its guest; But suffer me on yon lone hills to dwell, On my KithÃ¦ron, destined for my tomb, While still I lived, by mother and by sire, That I may die by those who sought to kill. And yet this much I know, that no disease, Nor aught else could have killed me; ne'er from death Had I been saved but for some evil dread. As for our fate, let it go where it will; But for my children, of my boys, O Creon, Take thou no thought; as men they will not feel, Where'er they be, the lack of means to live. But for my two poor girls, all desolate, To whom my table never brought a meal Without my presence, but whate'er I touched They still partook of with me;âcare for these; Yea, let me touch them with my hands, and weep With them my sorrows. Grant it, O my prince, O born of noble nature! Could I but touch them with my hands, I feel Still I should have them mine, as when I saw. Enter Antigone and Ismene. What say I? What is this? Do I not hear, ye Gods, their dear, loved tones, Broken with sobs, and Creon, pitying me, Hath sent the dearest of my children to me? Is it not so? Creon. It is so. I am he who gives thee this, Knowing the joy thou had'st in them of old. Ådip. A blessing on thee! May the Powers on high Guard thy path better than they guarded mine! Where are ye, O my children? Come, oh, come To these your brother's hands, that now have brought Your father's once bright eyes to this fell pass, Who, O my children, blind and knowing nought, Became your father e'en by her who bore me. I weep for you, (for sight is mine no more,) Picturing in mind the sad and dreary life Which waits you at men's hands in years to come; For to what friendly gatherings will ye go, Or solemn feasts, from whence, for all the joy And pride, ye shall not home return in tears? And when ye come to marriageable age, Who is there, O my children, rash enough To make his own the shame that then will fall, Reproaches on my parents, and on yours? What evil fails us here? Your father killed His father, and was wed in incest foul With her who bore him, and you twain begat Of her who gave him birth. Such shame as this Will men lay on you, and who then will dare To make you his in marriage? None, not one, My children! but ye needs must waste away, Unwedded, childless. Thou, MenÅkeus' son, Since thou alone art left a father to them, (For we their parents perish utterly,) Suffer them not to wander husbandless, Nor let thy kindred beg their daily bread, Nor make them sharers with me in my woe; But look on them with pity, seeing them At their age, but for thee, deprived of all. O noble soul, I pray thee, touch my hand In token of consent. And ye, my girls, Had ye the minds to hearken I would fain Give ye much counsel. As it is, pray for me To live where'er is meet; and for yourselves A brighter life than his ye call your sire. Creon. Enough of tears. Go thou within the house. Ådip. I needs must yield, however hard it be. Creon. In their right season all things prosper best. Ådip. Know'st thou my wish? Creon. Speak and I then shall know. Ådip. That thou should'st send me far away from home. Creon. Thou askest what the Gods alone can give. Ådip. As for the Gods, above all men they hate me. Creon. And therefore it may chance thou gain'st thy wish. Ådip. And dost thou promise? Creon. When I mean them not, I am not wont to utter idle words. Ådip. Lead me, then, hence. Creon. Go thou, but leave the girls. Ådip. Ah, take them not from me! Creon. Thou must not think To hold the sway in all things all thy life: The sway thou had'st did not abide with thee. Chorus. Ye men of Thebes, behold this Ådipus, Who knew the famous riddle and was noblest, Whose fortune who saw not with envious glances? And, lo! in what a sea of direst trouble He now is plunged. From hence the lesson learn ye, To reckon no man happy till ye witness The closing day; until he pass the border Which severs life from death, unscathed by sorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX OF RHYMED CHORAL ODES AND LYRICAL DIALOGUES. 151â215.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. What wert thou, O thou voice Of Zeus, that bad'st rejoice, Floating to Thebes from Pytho gold-abounding? I tremble; every sense Thrills with the dread suspense; (O Delian PÃ¦an, hear our cries resounding!) My soul is filled with fears, What thou wilt work on earth, Or now or in the circling years;â Speak, child of golden Hope, thou Voice of heavenly birth! Antistroph. I. Athena, first of all, Thee, child of Zeus, I call, And Artemis thy sister with us dwelling, Whom, on her glorious throne, Our agora doth own, And PhÅbos in the archer's skill excelling; Come, O ye Guardians three, If e'er in days of yore Ye bade the tide of evil flee, Drive off this fiery woe as once ye drove before. Stroph. II. Yea come; for lo! I fail To tell my woes' vast tale; For all my host in fear and sickness languish, And weapons fail each mind; For the earth's increase kind Is gone, and women faint in childbirth's anguish: Thou see'st men, one by one, Like bird of fleetest wing, Swifter than flashing ray of sun, Pass to His gloomy shore who reigns of darkness King. Antistroph. II. Countless the spoil of death; Our city perisheth, And on the tainted earth our infants lie; The tender heart is cold, And wives and matrons old, Now here, now there, by every altar cry. And clear the PÃ¦ans gleam, And chants of sorrow born; O golden child of Zeus supreme, Put forth thy power to help, bright-eyed as is the morn! Stroph. III. And Ares, mighty One, Who weaponless comes on, And fierce and hot with battle-cry assaileth,â Bid him in flight to tread By Amphitrite's bed, Or Thrakia's homeless coast where wild wave waileth. If aught is spared by night, It droops before the day; O Thou who wield'st the lightning's blazing might, O Zeus our Father, dart thy thunder him to slay! Antistroph. III. And oh! Lykeian king, That from thy gold-wrought string Thy arrows might go forth in strength excelling; And all the flashing rays That Artemis displays, Who on the Lykian mountains hath her dwelling! Thee, Bacchos, I invoke, Whose name our land hath borne, Come, wine-flushed, gold-crowned, MÃ¦nad-girt, with smoke Of blazing torch against that God, of Gods the scorn. 462â511.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Who was it that the rock of Delphos named, In speech oracular, That wrought with bloody hands his deeds dark-shamed? Well may he wander far, With footstep swifter and more strong Than wind-winged steed that flies along; For on him leaps, in Heaven's own panoply, With fire and flash, the son of Zeus most High, And with Him, dread and fell, The dark Fates follow, irresistible. Antistroph. I. For 'twas but now from out the snowy height Of old Parnassos shone The Voice that bade us all to bring to light The unknown guilty one; Each forest wild, each rocky shore, Like untamed bull, he wanders o'er, In dreary loneliness with dreary tread, Seeking to shun dark oracles and dread, From Delphi's central shrine; And yet they hover round with life and strength divine. Stroph. II. Dread things, yea, dread the augur wise hath stirred; I know not or to answer Aye, or No; In vain, perplexed, I seek the fitting word, And lost in fears nor past nor future know: What cause of strife so fell Between the son of Polybos hath come, And those, the heirs of old Labdakid home, I have found none to tell: From none comes well-tried word, That I should war against the glory great Of Ådipus my lord, Or make myself the avenger of an unknown fate. Antistroph. II. Yet Zeus and King Apollo, they are wise, And know the secret things that mortals do; But that a prophet sees with clearer eyes Than these I see with, is no judgment true. Though one in wisdom high May wisdom of another far excel; Yet I, until I see it 'stablished well, Will ne'er take up the cry: One thing is clear, she came, The wingÃ¨d maiden,âand men found him wise; Our city hailed his name, And from my heart the charge of baseness ne'er shall rise. 863â910.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Would 'twere my lot to lead My life in holiest purity of speech, In purity of deed, Of deed and word whose Laws high-soaring reach Through all the vast concave, Heaven-born, Olympos their one only sire! To these man never gave The breath of life, nor shall they e'er expire In dim oblivion cold: In these God shews as great and never waxeth old. Antistroph. I. The wantonness of pride Begets the tyrant,âwanton pride, full-flushed With thoughts vain, idle, wide, That to the height of topmost fame hath rushed, And then hath fallen low, Into dark evil where it cannot take One step from out that woe. I cannot bid the Gods this order break Of toil for noblest end; Yea, still I call on God as guardian and as friend. Stroph. II. But if there be who walks too haughtily In action or in speech, Who the great might of Justice dares defy, Whom nought can reverence teach, Ill fate be his for that his ill-starred scorn, Unless he choose to win Henceforth the gain that is of Justice born, And holds aloof from sin, Nor lays rash hand on things inviolable. Who now will strive to guard His soul against the darts of passion fell? If such deeds gain reward, What boots it yet again In choral dance to chant my wonted strain? Antistroph. II. No more will I at yonder spot divine, Earth's centre, kneeling fall, In AbÃ¦'s temple, or Olympia's shrine, Unless, in sight of all, These things appear as tokens clear and true. But oh, Thou Lord and King, If unto Thee that name be rightly due, Creation governing, Let it not 'scape Thee, or thy deathless might! For now the words of old To Laios uttered, they despise and slight; Nor does Apollo hold His place in men's esteem, And things divine are counted as a dream. 1186â1223.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. O race of mortal men, I number you and deem That ye, although ye live, Are but an empty dream. What man, yea, what, knows more Of happiness and peace, Than just the idle show, And then the sure decrease? Thy fate as pattern given, O Ådipus, my king, Thy doom, yea thine, I say, I know of none I count as truly prospering. Antistroph. I. Thou, once with strange success, As archer taking aim, Did'st hit the mark in all, Great riches and great fame; And did'st, (O Zeus!) lay low The maiden skilled in song, The monster terrible, With talons crook'd and long. Thou against death wast seen Thy country's sure defence; And therefore thou art king; To thee the Lord of Thebes we all our homage bring. Stroph. II. And who of all men is more wretched now? Who dwells with woe perpetually as thou, In chance and change of life, O Ådipus renowned, for whom was won The same wide haven, sheltering sire and son? Ah how, O mother-wife, Could that defilÃ¨d bed, when he had come, Receive him and be dumb? Antistroph. II. Time, the all-seeing, finds thee out at last, And passes sentence on the hateful past, The wedlock none might wed, Where son and spouse in strange confusion met. Ah, son of Laios, would I could forget! In one true word, thy succour gave me breath, By thee I sleep in death.</field>
