Envy that alwayes waits on Vertu's trayn, And tears the Graves of quiet sleeping Souls, Hath brought me, after many hundred years, To shew my self again upon the earth. Know then (who list) that I am English born, My name is Dunston; whilst I lived with men, Chief Primate of the Holy English Church: I was begotten in West Saxony: My Fathers name was Heorston, my Mothers Cinifred. Endowed with my Merit's legacy, I flourish'd in the reign of Seven great Kings; The first was Adelstane, whose Neece Elflida Malicious tongues reported, I defiled: Next him came Edmond, then Edred, and Edwin: And after him reign'd Edgar, a great Prince, But full of many Crimes which I restrain'd: Edward his Son, and lastly Egelred. With all these Kings was I in high esteem, And kept both them, and all the Land in awe; And, had I liv'd, the Danes had never boasted Their then beginning Conquest of this Land; Yet some accuse me for a Conjurer, By reason of those many miracles Which Heaven for holy life endowed me with. But who so looks into the golden Legend, (That sacred Register of holy Saints) Shall find me by the Pope canoniz'd, And happily the cause of this Report Might rise by reason of a Vision, Which I beheld in great King Edgar's dayes, Being that time Abbot of Glassenbury, Which (for it was a matter of some worth) I did make known to few, untill this day: But now I purpose that the World shall see How much those Slanderers have wronged me; Nor will I trouble you with Courts and Kings, Or drive a feined Battel out of breath; Or keep a coyle my self upon the Stage; But think you see me in my secret Cell, Arm'd with my Tortass, bidding of my Beads. But on a sudden I'me o'recome with sleep! If ought ensue, watch you, for Dunston dreams. He layeth him down to sleep; Lightning and Thunder; the Curtains drawn, on a sudden Pluto, Minos, Ãacus, Rhadamantus set in Counsell, before them Malbecco his Ghost guarded with Furies. Pluto. You ever dreaded Iudges of black Hell, Grim Minos, Ãacus, and Rhadamant, Lords of Cocitus, Styx, and Phlegiton, Prince, of Darkness, Pluto's Ministers, Know that the greatness of his present Cause Hath made our self in person set as judge, To hear the arraignment of Malbecco's Ghost; Stand forth thou gastly pattern of Despair, And to this powerfull Synod tell thy tayle, That we may hear if thou canst justly say Thou wert not Author of thy own decay. Malb. Infernal Iove, great Prince of Tartary, With humble reverence poor Malbecco speaks Still trembling with the fatal memory Of his so late concluded Tragedy. I was (with thanks to your great bounty) bred A wealthy Lord, whilst that I liv'd on Earth; And so might have continued to this day, Had not that plague of mankind faln on me: For I (poor man) joyn'd woe unto my name, By choosing out a Woman for my Wife. A Wife! a curse ordained for the World. Fair Hellena! fair she was indeed, But fouly stain'd with inward wickedness. I kept her bravely, and I loved her dear; But that dear love did cost my Life, and all. To reckon up a thousand of her pranks, Her pride, her wastfull spending, her unkindness, Her false dissembling, seeming sanctity, Her scolding, powting, prating, meddleing, And twenty hundred more of the same stamp, Were but to reap an endless Catalogue Of what the World is plagu'd with every day. But for the main of that I have to tell, It chanced thus: Late in a rainy night A crew of Gallants came unto my House, And (Will I, Nill I) would forsooth be lodg'd; I brought them in, and made them all good chear, (Such as I had in store) and lodg'd them soft: Amongst them one, ecclepped Paridell, (The falsest Thief that ever trod on ground) Rob'd me, and with him stole away my Wife. I (for I loved her dear) pursu'd the Thief. And, after many daies in travel spent, Found her amongst a crew of Satyrs wilde, Kissing, and colling all the live-long night: I spake her fair, and pray'd her to return: But she in scorn commands me to be gone; And glad I was to fly, to save my life, But when I backward came unto my House, I find it spoyled and all my treasure gone. Desp'rate and mad, I ran I knew not whither, Calling and crying out on Heaven and Fate, Till seeing none to pity my distress. I threw my self down head long on a Rock, And so concluded all my ills at once. Now, judge you, Iustice Benchers, if my Wife Were not the instrument to end my life. Pluto. Can it be possible (you Lords of Hell) Malbecco's tale of Women should be true; Is Marriage now become so great a Curse, That Whilome was the comfort of the World? Minos. Women, it seems, have lost their native shame, As no man better may complain than I, Though not of any whom I made my Wife, But of my Daughter who procur'd my fall. Ãacus. 'Tis strange what Plaints are brought us every day Of men made miserable by marriage; So that amongst a thousand, scarcely ten Have not some grievous actions 'gainst their Wives. Rhad. My Lord, if Rhadamant might counsell you, Your Grace should send some one into the World, That might make proof if it be true or no. Pluto. And wisely hast thou counselled Rhadamant, Call in Belphagor to me presently. One of the Furies goes for Belphagor. He is the fittest that I know in Hell To undertake a task of such import, For he is patient, mild, and pittifull: Humours but ill agrees with our Kingdom. Enter Belphagor. And here he comes; Belphagor, so it is, We in our awfull Synod have decreed. (Upon occasions to our selves best known) That thou from hence shall go into the world, And take upon thee the shape of a man; In which estate thou shalt be married: Choose thee a Wife that best may please thy self, And live with her a twelve month and a day; Thou shalt be subject unto humane chance So far as common wit cannot relieve thee; Thou shalt of us receive ten thousand pounds, Sufficient stock to use for thy increase: But whatsoever happens in that time, Look not from us for succour or relief; This shalt thou do, and when the time's expired, Bring word to us what thou hast seen and done. Bel. With all my heart (my Lord) I am content, So I may have my Servant Akercock To wait upon me as if he were my man, That he may witness likewise what is done. Plu. We are contented, he shall go with thee Mi. But what meantime decrees your Majesty of poor Malbecco? Plu. He shall rest with us Untill Belphagor do return again, And as he finds so will we give his doom. Come let us go and set our Spyal forth, Who for a time must make experiment, If Hell be not on Earth, as well as here. Exeunt. It thunders and lightens; the Devils go forth; Dunston rising, runneth about the Stage, laying about him with his Staff. Dun. Sathan avaunt, thou art mans enemy, Thou shalt not live amongst us so unseen, So to betray us to the Prince of Darkness: Sathan avaunt, I do conjure thee hence. What dream'st thou Dunston? yea I dreamt indeed, Must then the Devil come into the world? Such is belike the infernal Kings decree; Well, be it so, for Dunston is content, Mark well the process of the Devil's disguise, Who happily may learn you to be wise. Women beware, and make your bargains well, The Devil, to choose a Wife, is come from hell. Exit. SCENE 2d. Enter Morgan Earl of London, Lacy Earl of Kent, with Miles Forrest. Mor. My Lord of Kent, your Honor knows my mind, That ever have, and still do honour you, Accounting it my Daughter's happiness, (Amidst her other infelicities) That you vouchsafe to love her as you do: How gladly I would grant your Lordships suite, The Heavens can witness, which with ruthless eares Have often heard my yet unpittied Plaints; And could I find some means for her recovery, None but your self should have her to your Wife, Lacy. My Lord of London, now long time it is Since Lacy first was suiter to your Daughter, The farirest Honorea, in whose eyes Honor it self in Love's sweet bosome lyes: What shall we say, or seem to strive with heaven, Who speechless sent her first into the world; In vain it is for us to think to loose That which by Natures self we see is bound: Her beauty, with her other vertues joyn'd, Are gifts sufficient, though she want a tongue; And some will count it Vertue in a woman Still to be bound to un-offending Silence; Though I could wish with half of all my Lands, That she could speak: but since it may not be, 'Twere vain to imprison Beauty with her speech. For. Have you not heard (my Lords) the wondrous fame. Of holy Dunston, Abbot of Glassenbury, What miracles he hath atchieved of late, And how the rood of Dovercott did speak, Confirming his opinion to be true, And how the holy Consistory fell. With all the Monks that were assembled there, Saving one beam, whereon this Dunston sate, And other more such miracles as these. They say he is of such religious life, That Angels often use to talk with him, And tell to him the secrets of the Heavens. No question, if your Honors would but try, He could procure my Lady for to speak. Mor. Believe me Forrest, thou hast well advised, For I have heard of I to much talk of him. Lacy. Is not that Dunston he, who check'd the King About his privy dealing with the Nun, And made him to do pennance for the fault? Mor. The same is he, for whom I streight will send Miles Forrest shall in poste to Glassenbury, And gently, pray the Abbot for my sake To come to London: sure I hope the Heavens Have ordain'd Dunston to do Morgan good. Lacy. Let us dispatch him thither presently, For I my self will stay for his return. And see some end or other ere I go. Mor. Come then Lord Lacy, Forrest come away. Exeunt. SCENE 3d. Enter Belphagor attired like a Physician; Akercock his man in a Tawny Coat. Bel. Now is Belphagor an incarnate Devil Come to the earth to seek him out a Dame: Hell be my speed, and so I hope it will. In lovely London are we here arrived Whereas I hear the Earl hath a fair Daughter So full of vertue, and soft modesty, That yet she never gave a man foul word. Ak. Marry indeed they say she cannot speak. Bel. For this cause have I taken this disguise. And will profess me a Physician, Come upon purpose for to cure the Lady; Marry no way shall bind me but her self, And she I do intend shall be my wife. Ak. But Master, tell me one thing by the way, Do you not mean that I shall marry too? Bel. No Akercock, thou shalt be still unwed, For if: hey be as bad as is reported, One wife will be enough to tire us both. Ak. O then you mean that I shall now and then, Have, as it were a course at base with her. Bel. Nor so, nor so, that's one of Marriage plagues, Which I must seek to shun amongst the rest, And live in sweet contentment with my wife, That when I back again return to hell All women may be bound to reverence me, For saving of their Credits as I will. But who comes here? Enter Capt. Climon. Clin. This needs must tickle Musgrave to the quick, And stretch his heart-strings farther by an inch, That Lacy must be married to his Love; And by that Match my market is near marr'd, For Mariana, whom I most affect; But I must cast about by some devise To help my self and to prevent the Earle. Bel. This Fellow fitly comes to meet with me, Who seems to be acquainted with the Earle; Good Fortune guide you Sir. Cli. As much to you. Bel. Might I intreat a favour at your hands? Cli. What's that? Bel. I am a stranger here in England, Sir, Brought from my native home upon report, That the Earle's Daughter wants the use of speech, I have been practised in such Cures ere now, And willingly would try my skill on her: Let me request you so to favour me, As to direct me to her Father's house. Cli. With all my heart, and welcome shall you be To that good Earle, who mourns his Daughter's want; But they have for a holy Abbot sent, Who can (men say) do many miracles, In hope that he will work this wond'rous cure. Bel. What ere he be, I know 'tis past his skill, Nor any in the world, besides my self, Did ever sound the depth of that devise. Enter Musgrave. Cli. Musgrave well met; I needs must speak with you. Musg. I came to seek you. Cli. Tarry you a while. Shall I intreat you sir to walk before With this same Gentleman, and overtake you. Exeunt Bel. Ak. This is the newes, the Earle of Kent is come, And in all hast the marriage must be made, Your Lady weeps, and knows not what to do, But hopes that you will work some means or other To stoppe the crosse proceedings of the Earle. Musg. Alas poor Clinton, what can Musgrave do? Unless I should by stealth convey her thence, On which a thousand dangers do depend. Cli. Well (to be brief because I cannot stay) Thus stands the case, if you will promise me, To work your Cosen Marian to be mine; I'le so devise that you shall purchase her, And therefore tell me if you like the match? Musg. With all my heart Sir, yea and thank you too. Cli. Then say no more but leave the rest to me, For I have plotted how it shall be done; I must go follow yon fair Gentleman, On whom I build my hopes. Musgrave adue. Musg. Clinton farewell, I'le wish thee good success. Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enter Morgan, Lacy, Dunston, Forrest, Honorea, Marian. Mor. Thou holy man, to whom the higher Powers. Have given the gift of Cures beyond conceit; Welcome thou art unto Earl Morgans house! The house of sorrow yet, unless by thee Our joyes may spring anew, which if they do, Reward and praise shall both attend on thee. Lacy. And we will ever reverence thy name, Making the Chronicles to speak thy praise; So Honorea may but have her speech. Dun. My Lords, you know the hallowed gifts of Tongues, Comes from the self-same power that gives us breath, He binds and looseth them at his dispose, And in his name will Dunston undertake To work this cure upon fair Honorea, Hang there my Harp, my solitary muse, Companion of my Contemplation. He hangs his Harp on the wall. And, Lady, kneel with me upon the earth, That both our Prayers may ascend to Heaven. They kneel down; then enters Clinton, with Belphagor, terming himself Castiliano, and Akercock as Robin Goodfellow. Clin. So shall you do the Lady a good turn, And bind both him and me to you for ever. Bel. I have determin'd what I mean to do. Clin. Here be the Earles, and with them is the Fryer, Bel. What is he praying? Cli. So me thinks he is; But I'le disturb him by your leave my Lords, Here is a Stranger from beyond the Seas Will undertake to cure your Lordships daughter. Morg. The holy Abbot is about the Cure. Bel. Yea, but my Lord hee'l never finish it. Mor. How canst thou tell, what Country-man Bel. I am by birth, my Lord, a Spaniard born, And by descent came of a Noble house, Though for the love I bare to secret Arts, I never car'd to seek for vain Estate, Yet by my skill I have increased my wealth: My name Castiliano, and my birth No baser than the best blood of Castecle. Hearing your Daughter's strange infirmity, Ioyn'd with such matchless beauty and rare vertue, I cross'd the Seas on purpose for her good Dun. Fond man presuming on thy weaker skill, That thinkest by Art to over-rule the Heavens: Thou know'st not what it is thou undertak'st. No, no, my Lord, your daughter must be cur'd By fasting, prayer, and religious works; My self for her will sing a solemn mass, And give her three sips of the holy Challice, And turn my Beads with Aves and with Creeds, And thus, my Lord, your Daughter must be help'd. Cas. Zowndes, what a prating keeps the bald-pate Fryer? My Lord, my Lord, here's Church work for an age! Tush, I will cure her in a minutes space, That she shall speak as plain as you or I. Dunston's Harp sounds on the wall. For. Hark, hark my Lord, the holy Abbot's Harp Sounds by it self so hanging on the wall! Dun. Unhallowed man, that scorn'st the sacred read. Hark how the testimony of my truth Sounds heavenly musick with an Angel's hand, To testifie Dunston's integrity, And prove thy active boast of no effect. Cas. Tush Sir, that musick was to welcom me; The Harp hath got an other Master now, I warrant you 'twill never tune you more. Dun. Who should be Master of my Harp but I? Cas. Try then what service I will do for you. He tryes to play, but cannot. Dun. Thou art some Sorcerer, or Nigromancer. Who by thy Spells dost hold these holy strings. Cas. Cannot your Holyness unbind the bonds? Then I perceive my skill is most of force; You see, my Lord, the Abbot is but weak, I am the man must do your Daughter good. Mor. What wilt thou ask for to work thy cure? Cas. That without which I will not do the Cure; Her self to be my Wife, for which intent I came from Spain: then if she shall be mine, Say so, or keep her else for ever dum. Mor. The Earle of Kent, mine honourable friend, Hath to my Daughter been a Suiter long, And much it would displease both her and him To be prevented of their wished love; Ask what thou wilt beside, and I will grant it. Cas. Alass my Lord, what should the crazy Earle Do with so young a Virgin as your Daughter? I dare stand to her choyce 'twixt him and me. Lacy. And I will pawn mine Earldome with my Love, And loose them both, if I loose Honorea. Cas. A match my Lords, wee'l stand unto the Choyce. Mor. I am contented, if the Earle be pleased. Lacy. I were not worthy of her did I doubt. Cas. Then there it goes, fetch me a bowle of Wine, This is the match my Lord, before I work, If she refuse the Earle, she must be mine. Mor. It is One brings him a Cup of Wine, he straynes the juyce of the Herb into it. Cas. Now shall your Lordships see a Spaniard's skill. Who from the plains of new America Can find out sacred Symples of esteem To bind, and unbind Nature's strongest Powers: This Herb, which mortal men have seldome found, Can I with ease procure me when I list; And by this juyce shall Honorea speak; Here Lady, drink the freedom of thy heart, And may it teach thee long to call me Love. She drinks. Now lovely Honorea thou art free, Let thy Celestial voyce make choyce of me. Hon. Base Alien, mercinary Fugitive, Presumptuous Spaniard, that with shameless pride Dar'st ask an English Lady for thy Wife. I scorn, my Slave should honour thee so much, And for my self, I like my self the worse, That thou dar'st hope the gaining of my Love. Go, get thee gone, the shame of my esteem, And seek some drudge that may be like thy self. But as for you, good Earle of Kent, Me thinks your Lordship being of these years Should be past dreaming of a second Wife. Fy, fy, fy, my Lord, 'tis lust in doting age; I will not patronize so foul a sin. An old man dote on youth! 'tis monstrous; Go, home go home, and rest your weary head, 'Twere pity such a brow should learn to bud. And lastly unto you my Lord, and Father, Your love to me is too much overseen, That in your care and counsell should devise, To tye your Daughter's choyce to two such Grooms. You may elect for me, but I'le dispose And fit my self far better than both those; And so I will conclude, you as you please. Exit Honorea in a chafe. Rob. Call you this making of a Woman speak? I think they all wish she were dumb again. Cast. How now my Lord, what are you in a muse? Lacy. I would to God her Tongue were tyed again. Cast. I marry Sir, but that's an other thing, The Devil cannot tye a woman's tongue, I would the Fryer could do that with his Beads. But 'tis no matter, you my Lord have promis'd, If she refuse the Earl, she should be mine. Mor. Win her, and wear her man with all my heart. Cast. Oh! I'le haunt her till I make her stoop, Come, come my Lord, This was to try her voyce, Let's in and court her; one of us shall speed. Rob. Happy man be his dole that misseth her, say I, Dunst. My weaker Senses cannot apprehend The means this Stranger us'd to make her speak; There is some secret mystery therein, Conceal'd from Dunston! which the Heavens reveal, That I may scourge this bold blaspheming man, Who holds religious works of little worth. Exeunt, manet Clinton and Forrest. For. Now Captain Clinton what think you of me? Clin. My thinks, as yet, the Iest holds pretty The one hath taught her to deny himself, The other woo'd so long he cannot speed. For. This Newes will please young Musgrave. Clin. Marry will it, And I will hasten to acquaint him with them, Come let's away. Exeunt. Enter Parson Shorthouse, and Grim the Collier. Grim. No, Mr. Parson, grief hath made my heart and me a pair of Ballance, as heavy as lead; every night I dream I am a town top, and that I am whipt up and down with the scourge-stick of Love, and the mettell of Affection; and when I work, I find my self stark naked and as cold as a stone: now judge how I am tumbled and tost; poor Grim the Collier hath wisht himself burnt up amongst his Coles. Par. shorth. O Grim be wise dream not of Love Thy sorrows cannot Fancy move, If Iug love thee, love her again; If not thy kindness then refrain. Grim. I am not skill'd in your rhyming Mr. Parson; but that which is bred in the Flesh will never out of the Bone; I have seen as much as another man, my travel should teach me there's never a day in the week but I carry Coles from Croydon to London; and now when I rise in the morning to harnise my Horses, and load my Cart, methinks I have a Tayler sowing stitches in my Heart; when I am driving my Cart, my Heart that wanders one way my Eyes they leere another, my Feet they lead me I know not whither, but now and then into a Slow over head and eares; so that poor Grim that before was over shooes in Love, is now over head and eares in Durt and Mire. Par. Shor. Well Grim my counsell shall suffice To help thee, but in any wise Be rul'd by me, and thou shall see, As thou lovest her, she shall love thee. Grim. A lar'd! but do you think that will be so, I should laugh till I tickle to see that day, and forswear sleep all the next night after; Oh Master Parson, I am so haltred in affection, that I may tell you in secret, here's no body else hears me, I take no care how I fill my Sacks; every time I come to London my Coles are found faulty; I have been five times pilfered, my Coles given to the Poor, and my Sacks burnt before my face. It were a shame to speak this, but Truth will come to light; O Ione! thou hast thrown the Cole-dust of thy love into my eyes and stricken me quite blind. Par. Shorth. Now afore God the Collier chooseth well; For beauty, Iug, doth bear away the bell: And I love her; then Collier thou must miss, For Parson Shorthose vows, Iug shall be his. But hear'st thou Grim, I have that in my head, To plot that how thou shalt the Maiden wed. Grim. But are you sure you have that in your head? O for a hammer to knock that out; one blow at your Pate would lay all open to me, and make me as wise as you. Shorth. Think'st thou I do so often look For nothing on my learned book, As that I cannot work the feat; I warrant I'le the Miller cheat, And make Iug thine, in spite of him; Will this content thee neighbour Grim. Grim. Content me! Ay and so highly, that if you do this feat for me, you hire me to you as one hireth an Oxe or an Ass to use to ride, to spur, or any thing; yours to demand, miserable Grim! Ione's Handmaid for so I have called my self ever since last May day, when she gave me her hand to kiss. Shorth. Well, let's away, and in all hast, About it e're the day be past; And ever after, if thou hast her, Acknowledge me to be thy Master. Grim. I woose Sir; Come let's away, the best drink in Croydon's yours, I have it for you, even a dozen of Iugs to Iug's health. Ex. both. Enter Earl Morgan, Earl Lacy, Mariana. Morg. My Lord of Kent, the latter motion Doth bind me to you in a higher degree, Than all those many favours gone before; And now the issue of my help relyes Only on Mariana's gentleness, Who, if she will in such a common good Put to her helping hand the Match is made. Lacy. You need not make a doubt of Marian, Whose love unto her Lady were enough; Besides her Cozens and her own censent, To move her to a greater thing than this. Mary. My Lords, if ought there be in Marian, That may or pleasure you, or profit her, Ye shall not need to doubt of my consent. Mor. Gramercy Marian, and indeed the thing Is, in it self, a matter of no moment: If it be weighed aright; and therefore this, Thou know'st the bargain 'twixt me and the Doctor, Concerning Marriage with my only Daughter, Whom I determin'd that my Lord of Kent Should have espoused; but I see her mind Is only set upon thy Cozin Musgrave, And in her Marriage to use constraint Were bootless; therefore thus we have devised, Lord Lacy is content to loose his part, And to resign his Title to young Musgrave. But now the Doctor will not yield his right; Thus we determin to begin his hopes: Thou shalt this night be brought unto his bed, Instead of her, and he shall marry thee, Musgrave shall have my Daughter, She her will, And so shall all things sort to our content. Lacy. And this thou shalt be sure of Marian, The Doctor's wealth will keep thee royally; Besides, thou shalt be ever near thy Friends, That will not see thee wrong'd by any man. Say then wilt thou resove to marry him? Mar. My Lords, you know I am but young, The Doctor's fit for one of riper years, Yet in regard of Honorea's good, My Cozins profit, and all your contents, I yield my self to be the Doctor's wife. Morg. 'Tis kindly spoken, gentle Marian, Enter Castiliano. But here the Doctor comes. Lacy. Then I'le away, Lest he suspect ought by my being here. Morg. Do, and let me alone to close with him. Cast. May he ne're speak that makes a VVoman speak, She talks now, sure for all the time that's past, Her Tongue is like a Scare-crow in a tree, That clatters still with every puff of winde; I have so haunted her from place to place, About the hall from thence into the parler, Up to the Chamber, down into the Garden. And still she railes, and chafes, and scoulds, As if it were the Sessions day in hell, Yet will I haunt her with an open mouth. And never leave her till I force her love me. Morg. Now, Master Doctor, what a match or no. Cast. A match, quoth you, I think the Devil himself Cannot match her, for if he could, I should. Morg. Well, be content, 'tis I must work the mean, To make her yield whether she will or no: My Lord of Kent is gone hence in a chafe, And now I purpose that she shall be yours, Yet to her self unknown, for she shall think That Musgrave is the man, but it shall be you; Seem you still discontented and no more: Go Mariana call thy Mistriss hither, Now when she comes, dissemble what you know, And go away, as if you car'd not for her, So will she be the sooner brought unto't. Exit Mariana. Castil. My Lord, I thank you for your honest care, And, as I may, will study to requite it. Enter Honorea and Mariana. But here your Daughter comes: No, no, my Lord. 'Tis not for favour I regard nor her, Your Promise 'tis I challenge, which I'le have; It was my Bargain No man else should have her, Not that I love her, but I'le not bewrong'd By any one, my Lord, and so I leave you. Exit Castil. Morg. He's passing cunning to deceive himself, But all the better for the after sport. Hon. Sir did you send for me. Morg. Honorea, for thee. And this it is, how ere unworthily I have bestowed my love so long upon thee, That wilt so manifestly contradict me; Yet, that thou may'st perceive how I esteem thee, I make thy self he Guardian of thy Love, That thine own fancy may make choyce for thee; I have perswaded with my Lord of Kent, To leave to love thee. Now the peevish Doctor Swears, that his int'rest he will ne're resign; Therefore we must by Pollicy deceive him, He shall suppose he lyeth this night with thee, But Mariana shall supply thy room, And thou with Musgrave in another Chamber, Shall secretly be lodg'd; when this is done, Twill be too late to call that back again, So shalt thou have thy mind, and he a wife. Hon. But wilt thou, Mariana yield to this. Mar. For your sake, Lady I will undertake it. Hon. Gramercy Marian, and my noble Father. Now I acknowledge that indeed you love me. Morg. Well, no more words, but be you both prepar'd, The night draweth on, and I have sent in secret For Musgrave, that he may be brought unseen, To hide Suspition from their jealous eyes. Hon. I warrant you, come Marian, let us go. Exeunt Hon. &amp; Mar. Morg. And then, my Lord of Kent, shall be my Sonne, Should! go wed my Daughter to a Boy? No, no, young Girles must have their Wills restrain'd, For if the Rule be theirs, all runnes to nought. Exit. Enter Clack the Miller, with Ione. Clack. Be not Iug, as a man would say, finer than Five pence, or that it you are more proud than a Peacock that is, to seem to scorn to call in at Clacks mill as you pass over the bridge, there be as good Wenches as you be glad to pay me toll. Ione. Like enough Clack I had as live they as I, and a great deal rather too; you that take toll of so many Maids, shall never toule me after you: Oh God, what a dangerous thing 'tis but to peep once into Love! I was never so haunted with my harvest-work as I am with Love's passions. Clack. I but Ione, bear old Proverbs in your memory, soft and fair; now sir, if you make too much hast to fall foul, I and that upon a foul one too, there fades the flower of all Croydon, tell me but this, is not Clack the Miller as good a name as Grim the Collier? Ione. Alass, I know no difference in names; To make a Maid, or choose, or to refuse. Clack. You were best to say, No, nor in men nother. Well, I'le be sworn I have; but I have no reason to tell you so much, that care so little for me; yet hark: Clack speaketh in her ear: enter Grim, Parson Shorthose. Grim. O Mr. Parson, there he stands like a Scare-crow to drive me away from her, that sticks as close to my heart, as my shirt to my back, or my hose to my heel; O Mr. Parson Shorthose, Grim is but a man as another man is, Colliers have but lives as other men have; all's gone, if she go from me, Grim is no body without her, my heart is in my mouth, my mouth is in my hand, my hand threatens vengeance against the Miller, as it were a Beadle with a whip in his hand, triumphing o're a Beggar's back. Short. Be silent Grim, stand close and see, So shall we know how all things be. Grim. In wisedom I am appeas'd, but in anger I broyle as it were a rasher upon the coles. Ione. I'le not despise the Trades ye either have, Yet Grim the Collier may, if he be wise, Live even as merry as the day is long; For, in my judgement, in his mean estate Consists as much content, as in more wealth. Grim. O Mr. Parson, write down this sweet saying of her in Grim's commendations; she hath made my heart leap like a hobby horse; O Ione this speech of thine will I carry with me even to my grave. Short. Be silent then. Clack. Well, then I perceive you mean to lead your life in a Colepit, like one of the Devil's drudges, and have your face look like the outside of an old iron pot, or a blacking box. Grim. He calleth my Trade into question, I cannot forbear him. Short. Nay then you spoyle all neighbour Grim, I warrant you she will answer him. Ione. What I intend I am not bound to shew To thee, nor any other but my Mother, To whom in duty I submit my self; Yet this I tell thee, though my birth be mean, My honest vertuous life shall help to mend it, And if I marry any in all this life, He shall say boldly he hath an honest wife. Grim. O that 'twere my fortune to light upon her, on that Condition my Horses were dead, and my Cart broken, and I bound to carry Coles as long as I live from Croydon to London on my bare shoulders; Mr. Parson the Flesh is frayle, he shall tempt her no longer; she is but weak, and he is the stronger; I'le upon him. Miller thou art my neighbour, and therein charity hold my hands; but me thinks you having a water-gapp of your own, you may do as other Millers do, grind your grist at home, knock your coggs into your own Mill, you shall not cogg with her she doth discry thee, and I defie thee to a mortal fight, and so, Miller, good night. And now sweet Ione, be it openly known thou art my own. Clack. Well Grim, since thou art so Collier-like chollerick. Grim. Miller, I will not be mealy mouth'd. Clack. I'le give thee the fewer words now, be cause the next time we meet I'le pay thee all in dry blowes, carry Coles at a Collier's hands! and I do let my Mill be drown'd up in water, and I hang'd in the roof. Ione. And if thou lovest me Grim, forbear him now. Grim. If I love thee! dost thou doubt of that? nay ripp me up, and look into my heart, and thou shalt see thy own face pictur'd there as plainly as in the proudest Looking glass in all Croydon; if I love thee! then tears gush out, and shew my love. Clack. What Mr. Parson are you there? you remember you promis'd to win Ione for my own wearing? Short. I warrant thee Clack; but now be gone, Leave me to work that here alone. Clack. Well, farewell Mr. Shorthose, be true when you are trusted, Ex. Clack. Short, She shall be neither his nor thine, For I intend to make her mine, Grim. If I love thee Ione; those very words are a purgation to me, you shall see desparation in my face, and death marching in my very countenance; if I love! Short. What Grim hath grief drown'd thee at last? Are all thy joyes over cast? Is Ione in place, and thou so sad, Her presence, man, should make thee glad. Ione. Good Master Parson, 'twere no fault of mine, He takes occasion where there none was given; I will not blab unto the World, my love I owe to him, and shall do whilst I live. Grim. Well Ione, without all If's or Ands, E-persese, A-persese, or Tittle-tattles in the world, I do love thee, and so much, that in thy absence I cry when I see thee, and rejoyce with my very heart when I cannot behold thee. Short. No doubt, no doubt thou lovest her well. But listen now to what I tell; Since ye are both so well agreed, I wish you make more hast and speed, To morrow is Holy-rood day, When all a nutting take their way, Within the Wood a Close doth stand, Incompast round on either hand, With Trees and Bushes, there will I Dispatch your marriage presently. Grim. O Master Parson, your devising Fate hath blest me forever; Ione we'le have that so; the shorter the work, the sweeter. Iane. And if my Mother give but her consent, My absence shall in no case hinder it. Grim. Shee! quotha, she is mine already, we'le to her presently. Mr. Parson; 'tis a match; we'le meet you: now Miller do I go beyond you, I have stript him of the Wench, as a Cook would strip an Eele out of her skin, or a Pudding out of the Case thereof; now I talk of a Pudding, O 'tis my only food, I am old dog at it; Come Ione, let's away, I'le pudding you. Short. Well, if my Fortune luckily ensue, As you shall cozen him, I'le cozen you. Exeunt. Enter Castiliano at one door with Mariana, Earle Lacy, at an other door with Honorea. Cast. Come lovely Honorea, bright as day, As came Alomena from her sacred bed With Iupiter, shapt like Amphitrio: So show my Love, my Love! whom have we here? Hon. Sweet Musgrave; out alass I am betray'd! Cast. Thou art my Love? Lacy. No, mine? Hon. Nor yours, nor yours: But Musgrave's Love; O Musgrave where art thou? Lacy. Be not displeas'd my Dear, give me thy hand. Hon. My hand, false Earle, nor hand not heart of mine; Could'st thou thus cunningly deceive my hopes, And could my Father give consent thereto, Well, neither he nor thou shalt force my Love. Cast. 'Tis I fair Honorea am thy Love, Forsake the worthless Earle, give me thy hand. Mari. Whose hand would you have sir? this hand is mine, And mine is yours, then keep you to your own. Mari. Yet are you mine, sir, and I mean to keep you; What, do you think to shake me off so soon? No gentle Husband, now it is too late; You should have look'd before you came to bed. Enter Rob. Goodf. with his Masters Gown. Rob. Many good morrows to my gentle Master, And my new Mistriss. God give you both joy; What say you to your Gown sir, this cold morning? Cast. Robin I am undone, and cast away. How Master, cast away upon a Wife! Cast. Yea Robin cast away upon a Wife. Rob. Cast her away then Master; can you not? Mar. No sir he cannot, nor he shall not do it. Rob. Why, how know you? I am sure you are not she. Mar. Yes sir, I am your Mistriss as it falls. Rob. As it falls! quoth ye, marry a foul fall is it. Mar. Base Rascal, dost thou say that I am foul? Rob. No, 'twas foul play for him to fall upon you. Mar. How know you that he fell, were you so nigh. She giveth Robin a box on the eare. Rob. Mass it should seem 'twas he that fell if any. For you me thinks are of a mounting natures What, at my Eares at first! a good beginning. Lacy. My dear Delight, why dost thou stain thy Cheeks? Those rosie Beds with this unseemly dew; Shake off those Tears that now untimely fall, And smile on me, that am thy Summers joy. Hon. Hapless am I to loose so sweet a prison, Thus to obtain a weary liberty; Happy had I been so to have remain'd, Of which estate I ne're should have complain'd. Rob. Whoop whoo! more Marriages! and all of a sort; happy are they, I see, that live without them; if this be the beginning, what will be the ending? Enter to them Earle Morg. and Dunst. Mor. Look Dunston where they be, displeas'd no doubt, Try if thou canst work reconciliation. Cast. My Lord, I challenge you of breach of promise, And claim your Daughter here to be my wife. Lacy. Your claim is nought, sir, she is mine already. Hon. Your claim is nought Sir, I am none of yours. Mar. Your claim is here Sir, Marian is yours. What Husband, newly married, and inconstant! 'Greed we so well together all this night, And must we now fall out? for shame, for shame. A man of your years, and be so unstayed! Come, come away, there may no other be, I will have you, therefore you shall have me. Rob. This is the bravest Country in the world, Where men get wives whether they will or no; I how e're long some Wench will challenge me. Cast. Oh! is not this a goodly consequence, I must have her, because she will have me? Dunston. Ladies and Gentlemen, here Dunston speak: Marriage, no doubt, is ordain'd by Providence, Is sacred, not to be, by vain affect, Turn'd to the idle humours of mens brains; Besides, for you my Ladie Honorea, Your dutie binds you to obey your Father, Who better knows what fits you than your self; And 'twere, in you, great folly to neglect The Earle's great love, whereof you are unworthy, Should you but seem offended with the match; Therefore submit your self, to make amends; For 'tis your fault, so may you all be friends. Morg. And Daughter, you must think what I have done, Was for your good, to wed you to the Earle, Who will maintain and love you royally: For what had Musgrave but his idle shape? A shadow to the substance you must build on. Rob. She will build substances on him I trow, Who keeps a Shrew against her will, had better let her go. Mar. Madam conceal your grief, and seem content, For, as it is, you must be rul'd perforce; Dissemble till convenient time may serve To think on this dispite and Musgrave's love. Lacy. Tell me my Dear, will thou at length be pleas'd. Hon. As good be pleas'd, my Lord, as not be eas'd; Yet though my former love did move me much, Think not amiss, the same love may be yours. Cast. What! is't a Match? nay then since you agree, I cannot mend my self, for ought I see; And therefore, 'tis no good to be content Come Lady, 'tis your lot to be my Dame. Lording adieu, God send ye all good speed; Some have their Wives for pleasure, some for need. Lacy. Adieu Castiliano we are friends? Cast. Yes, yes, my Lord, there is no remedy. Rob. No remedy, my Masters for a Wife? A note for young beginners, mark it well. Exeunt all. Enter Forrest, Capt. Clinton, Harvey. For. Now Gallants what imagine you of this, Our noses are all flirt; for Mariana, The Spanish Doctor hath her to his wife; And Musgraves hopes are dead for Honorea, For she is married to the Earle of Kent, 'Twill be good sport to see them when they rise, If so they be not gotten up already? Clin. I say the Devil go with them all for me, The Spanish Doctor marry Marian! I think that Slave was born to cross me still; Had it not been last day before the Earle, Vpon my Conscience I had crack'd his Crown, When first he ask'd the Lady for his Wife; Now hath he got her too, whom I desir'd. Why, he'le away with her e're long to Spain, And keep her there to dispossess our hopes. For. No, I can comfort ye for that suppose; For yesterday he hir'd a dwelling house; And here he means to tarry all this year, So long at least, what e're he doth hereafter. Clin. A sudden plot-form comes into my minde, And this it is, Miles Forrest, thou and I Are partly well acquainted with the Doctor. Ralph Harvey shall along with us to him, Him we'le prefer for his Apothecary: Now, sir, when Ralph and he are once acquainted, His wife may often come unto his House, Either to see his Garden, or such like; For doubt not Women will have means enough If they be willing, as I hope she will; There may we meet her, and let each one plead, He that speeds best, why let him carry it. For. I needs must laugh, to think how all we three, In the contriving of this feat, agree; But having got her, every man will strive, How each may other of her love deprive. Clin. Tut, Forrest, Love admits these friendly strifes; But say, How like you of my late devise? For. Surpassing well, but let's about it streight, Lest he, before our comming be provided. Clin. Agreed. Exeunt. Enter Musgrave and Mariana. Musg. Tush Cozen, tell not me; but this devise Was long ago concluded 'twixt you two, Which divers reasons move me to imagine; And therefore these are toyes to blind my eyes, To make me think she only loved me, And yet is married to another man. Mar. Why Cozen Musgrave, are your eyes so blinde, You cannot see the truth of that report; Did you not know my Lord was alwaies bent, Whatever came, to wed her to the Earle: And have you not, besides, heard the devise He us'd to marry her against her will, Betray'd, poor Soul, unto Earle Lacye's bed, She thought she held young Musgrave in her armes. Her morning tears might testifie her thoughts; Yet thou shalt see she loves thee more than him, And thou shalt taste the sweets of her delights; Mean time my House shall be thy mansion, And thy abode, for thither will she come; Vse thou that opportunity, and try Whether she loved thee, or did but dissemble. Musg. If she continue kind to me hereafter I shall imagine well of her and you. Ent. Cast. Cast. Now Dame, in talk, what Gentleman is this? Mar. My Cozen Musgrave, Husband, comes to see you. Cast. Musgrave! now on my Faith heartily welcome: Give me thy hand, my Cozen, and my Friend, My Partner in the loss of Honorea, We two must needs be Friends, our Fortune's like: Marry, yet I am richer by a Shrew. Marian. 'Tis better be a Shrew, sir, then a Sheep; You have no cause I hope yet to complain. Cast. No Dame, for yet you know 'tis honey moone; What, we have scarcely setled our acquaintance. Musg. I doubt not, Cozen, but ye shall agree; For she is mil'd enough if she be pleas'd. Cast. So is the Devil, they say, yea Cozen, yea, My Dear and I, I doubt not, shall agree. Enter Robin. Rob.

God save you Seignior Castiliano. Cast. O Captain Comesta, Welcom all my friends. For. Sir, we are come to bid God give you joy, And see your House. Mar. Welcome Gentlemen: T'is kindly done to come to see us here. Ro. This kindness makes me fear my Master's head; Such hot-spurs must have game; how e're they get it. Clin. We have a suite to you, Castiliano. Cast. What is it, Sir, if it lyes in me, 'tis done. Clin. Nay, but a trifle Sir, and that is This same young man, by trade Apothecary, Is willing to retein unto your Cures. Castil. Marry with all my heart and welcome too.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Rob. Goodfellow with his head broken Rob. The Devil himself take all such Dames for me Zounds, I had rather be in hell than here; Nay let him be his own man if he list, Robin means not to stay to be used thus, The very first day in her angry spleen, Her nimble hand began to greet my Eares With such unkind salutes as I ne're felt; And since that time there hath not past an hour Wherein she hath not either rayl'd upon me, Or laid her anger's load upon my limbs; Even now for no occasion in the world, But as it pleas'd her Ladiship to take it, She gate me up a staff and breaks my head; But I'le no longer serve so curs'd a Dame, I'le run as far first as my leggs will bear me: What shall I do? to Hell I dare not go! Untill my Master's Twelve months be expired. And here to stay with Mistress Marian, Better to be so long in purgatory. Now farewell Master, but shrewd Dame fare il I'le leave you, though the Devil is with you still. Ex. Robin. Enter Mariana alone chafing. Mar. My heart still pants within; I am so chaf't, The Rascal slave my man, that sneaking Rogue Had like to have undone us all for ever; My Cozen Musgrave is with Honorea, Set in an Arbour in the Summer Garden, And he, forsooth, must needs go in for hearbs, And told me further, that his Master bid him; But I laid hold upon my Younker's pate, And made the blood run down about his ears, I trow he shall ask me leave ere he go; Now is my Cozen Master of his Love, The Lady at one time reveng'd and pleas'd: So speed they all that marry Maids perforce; Enter Castiliano. But here my Husband comes. Cast. What Dame alone? Mar. Yes Sir, this once for want of company. Cast. Why, where's my Lady, and my Cozen Musgrave? Mar. You may go look them both for ought I know. Cast. What, are you angry Dame? Mar. Yea, so it seems. Cast. VVhat is the cause I prethee? Mar. VVhy would you know? Cast. That I might ease it, if it lay in me. Mar. O, but it belongs not to your trade. Cast. You know not that. Mar. I know you love to prate, and so I leave you. Exit Mar. Cast. VVell, go thy way; oft have I raked hell To get a wife, yet never found her like: VVhy this it is to marrie with a Shrew. Yet, if it be, as I presume it is, There's but one thing offends both her and me, And I am glad if that be it offends her. 'Tis so no doubt, I read it in her brow, Lord Lacy shall, with all my heart, enjoy Fair Honorea, Marian is mine; VVho though she be a Shrew, yet is she honest; So is not Honorea, for even now, VValking within my Garden all alone, She came with Musgrave, stealing closely by, And follows him that seeks to flye from her; I spied this all unseen, and left them there; But sure my Dame hath some conceit thereof, And therefore she is thus angry, honest Soul: VVell, I'le streight hence unto my Lord of Kent, And warn him watch his wife from these close meetings. VVell Marian, thou livest yet free from blame, Let Ladies go, thou art the Devil's Dame. Exit Castil. Enter the Devil like Musgrave with Honorea. Musg. No Lady, let thy modest vertuous life Be alwaies joined with thy comely shape, For Lust ecclipseth Nature's ornament. Hon. Young heady Boy, think'st thou thou shalt recall Thy long made Love, which thou so oft hast sworn? Making my Maiden-thoughts to dote on thee. Musg. With patience hear me, and if what I say Shall jump with reason, then you'l pardon me: The time hath been when my Soul's libertie Vow'd servitude unto that heavenly face, VVhilst both had equal libertie of choice: But since the holy bond of marriage Hath left me single, you a wedded wife, Let me not be the third, unlawfully To do Earle Lacy so foul Injurie; But now at last, Hon. I would that last Might be thy last, thou Monster of all men. Musg. Hear me with patience. Hon. Cease, I'le hear no more; 'Tis my Affection, and not Reason speaks; Thou Musgrave turn the hardness of thy heart, And now at last incline thy love to mine. Mus. Nay now I see thou wilt not be reclaim'd, Go and bestow this hot love on the Earle, Let not these loose affects, thus scandalize Your fair report; go home and learn to live As chaste as Lucrece, Madam so I leave you. She pulleth him back. Hon. O stay a little while, and hear my tongue Speak my hearts words, which cannot choose but tell thee, I hate the Earle, only because I love thee. Exit Musgrave. Musgrave return, hear Honorea speaks: Disdain hath left him wings to flye from me, Sweet Love lend me thy wings to overrake him, For I can stay him with kind dalliance! All this is but the blindness of my fancy. Recall thy self: let not thy honour bleed VVith the foul wounds of Infamie and Shame: My proper Home shall call me home again, VVhere my dear Lord bewailes as much as I, His too much love to her that loves not him. Let none hereafter fix her maiden love Too firm on any, lest she feel with me, Musgrave's revolt, and his unconstancy. Exit. Enter Forrest with Marian. For. Tut, I'le remember thee, and streight return, But heres the Doctor. Mar. Where? Forrest, farewell, I would not have him see me for a world. For. Why? he is not here, well now I see you fear him. Mar. Marry beshrew thee for thy false alarum, I fear him? no, I neither fear nor love him. For. But where's my Lady, she is gone home before, And I must follow after, Marian farewell. Mar. I shall expect your comming. For. Presently, and hearest thou Marian, nay it shall be so. He whispereth in her ear. Mar. O Lord, sir, you are wed I warrant you, We'le laugh, be merry, and it may be kis, But if you look for more, you aime amiss. For. Go to, go to, we'le talk of his anon. Exit. Forrest. Mar. Well go thy way, for the true heartedst man That livest, and as full of honesty, And yet as wanton as a pretty Lambe; He'le come again, for he hath loved me long, And so have many more besides himself: But I was coy and proud, as Maids are wont, Meaning to match beyond my mean estate, Yet have I favoured youths, and youthful sports, Although I durst not venture on the main; But now it will not be so soon espy'd. Maids cannot, but a wife a fault may hide. Enter Nan. What Nan! Nan. Anon forsooth. Mar. Come hither Maid, Here take my keyes, and fetch the galley pot, Bring a fair Napkin, and some fruit dishes, Dispatch and make all ready presently, Miles Forrest will come streight to drink with me. Nan. I will forsooth. Exit Nan. Mar. Why am I young, but to enjoy my years? Why am I fair, but that I should be loved? And why should I be loved, and not love others? Tut, she is a fool, that her affection smothers: 'Twas not for love I was the Doctor's wife, Nor did he love me when he first was mine; Tush, tush, this Wife is but an idle name, I purpose now to try another Game. Art thou return'd so soon! O 'tis well done. Enter Nan with the Banquet And hearest thou Nan, when Forrest shall return, If any happen to enquire for me, Whether't be Captain Clinton, or Ralph Harvey, Call presently, and say thy Master is come, So I'le send Forrest o're the Garden pale. Nan. I will forsooth. Mar. Mean time stay thou and make our banquet readie, I'le to my Closet, and be here again, Before Miles Forrest shall come visit me. Ex. Mar. Nan. I wonder what my Mistriss is about, Somewhat she would not have my Master know; What e're it be, it's nothing unto me, She is my good Mistriss, and I'le keep her Counsell, I have oft seen her kiss behind his back, And laugh and toy when he did little think it: O what a winking eye the Wanton hath To cozen him, even when he looks upon her. But what have I to do with what she doth? I'le tast her Ionkets, since I am alone, That which is good for them, cannot hurt me, I marry this is sweet, a cup of Wine Will not be hurtfull for disgestion. Ent. Cast. Cast. I would I had been wiser once to day, I went on purpose to my Lord of Kent, To give him some good counsell for his VVife, And he, poor Heart, no sooner heard my newes, But turns me up his VVhites, and falls flat down; There I was fain to rub and chafe his veins, And much ado we had to get him live; But for all that he is extremely sick, And I am come in all the hast I may For Cordials to keep the Earle alive: But how now, what a Banquet what means this? Nan. Alass my Master is come home himself: Mistriss, Mistriss, my Master is come home, He stops her mouth. Cast. Peace you young Strumpet, or I'le stop your speech: Come hither Maid, tell me, and tell me true, VVhat means this Banquet? what's your Mistriss doing? Why cam'st thou out, when as thou saw'st me comming? Tell me, or else I'le hang thee by the heels, And whip thee naked: come on, what's the matter? Nan. Forsooth I cannot tell. Cast. Can you not tell: come on, I'le make you tell me. Nan. O Master! I will tell you. Cast. Then say on. Nan. No thing in truth forsooth but that she means To have a Gentleman come drink with her. Cast. What Gentleman? Man. Forsooth 'tis Mr. Forrest as I think. Cast. Forrest! nay then I know how the Game goeth, Who ever looseth I am sure to win By their great kindness, though't be but the Hornes: Enter Forrest at one door, Marian at another. But here comes he and she, come hither Maid, Upon thy life give not a word, a look, That she may know ought of my being here; Stand still, and do what e're she bids thee do. Go, get thee gone, but if thou dost betray me, I'le cut thy Throat, look to it, for I will do it; I'le stand here close to see the end of this, And see what Reaks she keeps when I'm abroad. Mar. 'Tis kindly done Miles to return so soon, And so I take it. Nan, is our Banquet ready? Welcome my Love, I see you'l keep your word. Nan. 'Twere better for yee both he had not kept it. For. Yea Mariana, else I were unworthy, I did but bring my Lady to the door, And there I left her full of melancholly, And discontented. Mar. Why, 'twas kindly done, Come, come sit down, and let us laugh a while. Maid, fill some Wine Nan. Alass my Breech makes Buttons, And so would theirs, knew they as much as I. He may change the sweet meats, and put Purging comfits in the Dishes. Mar. Here's to my Lady, and my Cozen Musgrave. For. I pray remember gentle Master Doctor, And good Earle Lacy too among the rest. Cast. O sir, we find you kind, we thank you for it, The time may come when we may cry you quit, Nan. Master, shall I steal you a cup of wine? Cast. Away you Baggage, hold your peace you Wretch. For. But I had rather walk into your Orchard, And see your Gallary so much commended, To view the VVorkmanship he brought from Spain, Wherein's describ'd the banquet of the gods. Mar. I, there's one piece exceeding lively done, Where Mars and Venus lye within a net, Inclos'd by Vulcan, and he looking on. Cast. Better and better yet, 'twill mend anon. Mar. Another of Diana with her Nymphes, Bathing their naked bodies in the streams, Where fond Acteon, for his eyes offence, Is turn'd into a Hart's shape, hornes and all; And this the Doctor hangs right o're his bed. For. Those Hornes may fall and light upon his head. Cast. And if they doe, worse Luck, what remedy? For. Nay Marian, we'le not leave these sights unseen, And then wee'le see your Orchard and your fruit; For now there hangs Queen apples on the trees, And one of them are worth a score of these. Mar. Well, you shall see them, least you loose your longing. Exeunt Marian and Forrest. Cast. Nay, if ye fall alonging for green fruit, Childe-bearing is not far of I am sure: Why this is excellent, I feel the buds, My Head groweth hard, my Horns will shortly spring, Now who may lead the Cuckold's dance but I? That am become the head man of the Parish: O! this it is to have an honest wife, Of whom so much I boasted once to day. Come hither Minks, you know your Mistriss's minde, And you keep secret all her villanies, Tell me, you were best, where was this Plot devised? How did these Villaines know I was abroad? Nan. Indeed forsooth I knew not when it was, My Mistriss call'd me from my work of late, And bad me lay a Napkin; so I did, And made this Banquet ready: but in truth I knew not what she did intend to do. Cast. No, no, you did not watch against I came, To give her warning to dispatch her Knaves? You cryed not out, when as you saw me come, All this is nothing but I'le rouse you all. Nan. In truth good Master. Enter Marian, Forrest. Cast. Peace I say, they come. Whimper not, and you do, I'le use you worse: Behold that wicked Strumpet with that Knave, O that I had a pistoll for their sakes, That at one shot I might dispatch them both: But I must stand close yet, and see the rest. Mar. How like'st thou Miles my Orchard, and my House. For. Well, thou art seated to thy hearts content, A pleasant Orchard, and a House well furnisht, There nothing wants; but in the Gallary The Painter shews his art exceedingly. Mar. Yet is there one thing goeth beyond all these, Contented life, that giveth the Heart his ease. And that I want. One knocketh at the door. For. Sweet Love, adieu. Ex. For. Mar. Farewell Sweetheart. VVho is that at the door? Clin. A Friend. Enter Clinton. Mar. Come near. What Captain is it you? Clin. Even I, fair Marian watching carefully The blessed step of opportunity. Mar. Good, good! how Fortune gluts me with excess! Still they that have enough shall meet with more. Clin. But where's the Doctor? Mar. Ministring abroad Physick to some sick Patients he reteins. Clin. Let him abroad, I'le minister at home, Such Physick shall content my Marian. Cast. O monstrous! now the VVorld must see my shame, This Head must bear whatever likes my Dame. Mar. I have no malladie requires recure. Clin. Why, then must I assume a sick man's part, And all my sickness lyeth at my heart, T'is the heart-burning that torments me so. Marian. There is no cure for fire but to be quench'd. Clin. Thou hast prescrib'd a soveraign remedy. Cast. O who the Devil made her a Physician? Clin. Let's not obscure what Love doth manifest, Nor let a Stranger's bed make thee seem strange To him that ever loved and honoured thee. Mar. A Captain made a Captive by loose Love, And gadding Fancie; fie, 'twere monstrous shame That Cupid's bow should blemish Mars his name; Take up thy Armes, recall thy drooping thoughts, And lead thy Troops into the spacious Fields. Cast. She counsels others well, if she would take it. Clin. Thou counsellest the blinde to lead the blinde; Can I lead them that cannot guide my self? Thou, Marian, must release my captive Heart. Mar. With all my heart, I grant thee free release. Clin. Thou art obscure too much: but tell me, Love, Shall I obtain my long-desired Love? Mar. Captain, there is yet somewhat in thy mind Thou would'st reveal, but wantest utterance; Thou better knowest to front the braving foe, Then plead Love suites. Clin. I grant 'tis even so, Extremity of Passions still are dum, No tongue can tell Love's chief perfections, Perswade thy self my Love-sick thoughts are thine, Thou only mayest those drooping thoughts refine. Mar. Since at my hands thou seek'st a remedy, I'le ease thy grief, and cure thy malady; No drugg the Doctor hath shall be too dear, His antidote shall flye to do thee good, Come in and let thy eye make choyse for thee, That thou may'st know how dear thou art to me. Exeunt Clinton, Marian. Cast. Is this obedience, now the Devil go with them, And yet I dare not; Oh she's mankind grown! O miserable men that must live so, And damned Strumpets, Authors of this woe: Enter Clint. Mar. But peace! be still! they come! O shameless shame, Well may the world call thee the Devil's dame. Mar. Captain thy skill hath pleased me so well, That I have vowed my service to Bellona. Cast. Her service to Bellona! turn'd stark Ruffian! She'le be call'd Caveleero Marian. Clin. And I will trayn thee up in feats of arms, And teach thee all the orders of the field, That whilst we, like to Mars and Venus, jest, The Doctor's head may get a gallant crest. Cast. I can no longer linger my disgrace, Nor hide my shame from their detested sight, How now thou Whore, dishonour to my bed, Disdain to Womanhood, shame of thy sex, Insatiate monster, corizive of my Soul, What makes this Captain revelling in my house? My House! nay, in my Bed! you'l prove a Soul dier, Follow Bellona, turn a Martialist! I'le try if thou hast learnt to ward my blowes. Mar. Why how now man! is this your madding month? What, sir, will you forbid me in good sort, To entertain my friends. Cast. Your Friends, you Whore: They are no Friends of mine, nor come they here: Clinton avaunt, my House is for no such. Mar. Alass good sir, are you grown so suspicious, Thus on no proofs to nourish jealousie; I cannot kiss a man, but you'l be angry. In spite of you, or who so else sayeth nay, My Friends are welcome as they come this way, If thou mislike it, mend it as thou may: VVhat do you think to pin up Marian, As you were wont to do your Spanish girles, No sir, I'le be half Mistriss of my self, The other half is yours, if you deserve it. Clin. What madness mov'd thee be displeas'd with me, That alwayes us'd thee with so kind regard, Did I not at thy first arrival here Conduct thee to the Earle of London's house? Mar. Did I not, being unsolicited, Bestow my first pure Maiden-love on thee? Clin. Did I not grace the there in all the Court, And bear thee out against the daring Abbot? Mar. Did I forsake many young Gallant Courtiers, Enamoured with thy aged Gravity? Who now being weary of me, would'st disgrace me? Cast. If there be any Conscience left on earth, How can I but believe these Protestations? Clin. Have I not alwaies been thy nearest friend? Mar. Have I not alwaies been thy dearest wife? Clin. How much will all the world in this condemn thee. Mar. At first I little fear'd what now I find, And grieve too late. Cast. Content thee gentle Dame, The nature of our Countrymen is such, That if we see another kiss our Wives, We cannot brook it: but I will be pleas'd; For, will I, nill I, so me thinks I must: And gentle Captain, be not you offended, I was too hot at first, but now repent it: I prethee gentle Dame forgive me this, And drown all Iealousie in this sweet kiss. Clin. This shews your wisdom; on, I'le follow you. Mar. Well Doctor, henceforth never reake it scorn, At my sweet Clinton's hands to take the horn. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Enter Robin Good fellow in a suite of Leather close to his body, his Face and Hands coloured russet-colour, with a Flayle. Rob. The Doctor's self would scarce know Robin now: Curs't Marian may go seek another man, For I intend to dwell no longer with her, Since that the Bastinado drove me thence; These silken Girles are all too fine for me, My Master shall report of those in Hell, Whilst I go range amongst the Country maids, To see if home-spun Lasses milder be Than my curst Dame, and Lacie's wanton wife; Thus therefore will I live betwixt two shapes, When as I list in this transform'd disguise, I'le fright the Country people as they pass, And sometimes turn me to some other form, And so delude them with fantastick shows: But woe betide the silly Dairy maids, For I shall fleet their Cream-bowles night by night. And slice the Bacon flitches as they hang. VVell here in Croydon will I first begin To frolick it among the Country Lobs: This day they say is call'd Holy-rood day, And all the Youth are now a nutting gone; Here are a crew of Yonkers in this VVood, VVell sorted, for each Lad hath got his Lass; Marrie indeed there is a tricksey Girle, That three or four would fain be doing with, But that a wily Priest among the rest, Intends to bear her shere away from all; The Miller, and my Brother Grim the Collier, Appointed here to scuffle for her Love: I am on Grim's side, for long time ago The Devill call'd the Collier like to like: Enter Grim, Clack, Parson Shorthose. Ione with a bagg of Nutts. But here the Miller and the Collier come, VVith Parson Make bate, and their tricksey Girle. Grim. Parson, perswade me no more, I come Iugg to your custody, Iugg hold the Nut-bagg. Clack. Nay, I will give you Nutts to crack. Grim. Crack in thy Throat and hauster too. Short. Neighbours I wish you both agree, Let me be judge, be rul'd by me. Grim. Mr. Parson, remember what Pluriles sayth, ne aceesseris ad consilio, &amp;c. I tell you I found this written in the bottom of one of my empty Sacks; never perswade men that be inexecrable: I have vowed it, and I will perform it: the Quarrel is great, and I have taken it upon my own Shoulders. Clack. I that thou shalt e're I have done, for I will lay it on i'faith. Grim. If you lay it in, I must bear it out: this is all: If you strike, I must stand to any thing although it be the biggest blow that you can lay upon me. Ione. Ye both have oftentimes sworn that ye love me, Let me o're-rule you in this angry mood: Neighbours and old acquaintance, and fall out! Rob. Why, that is because thou wilt not let them fall in? Grim. I say, my heart bleedeth when thou speakest, and therefore do not provoke me: yet Miller, as I am monstrous angry, so I have a wonderfull great mind to be repeas'd: let's think what harm commeth by this same fighting, if we should hurt one another, how can we help it? Again, Clack do but here forswear Ione's company, and I'le be thine instead of her, to use in all your businesses from Croydon to London, yours Gilbert Grim, the chief Collier for the King's Majesties own mouth. Clack. O Grim, do I smell you? I'le make you forswear her before we two part, and therefore come on to this geere: Collier I will lay on load, and when it is done, let who will take it off again. Iugg. Yet once more hear me speak, leave off for shame, If not for Love, and let not others laugh To see your follies, let me over rule ye. Short. Oh let them fight, I care not, I, Mean time away with Ione I'le fly, And whilst they two are at it here, We two will sport our selves elsewhere. Rob. There's a stone Priest, he loveth a Wench indeed, He careth not though both of them do bleed; But Robin Goodfellow will conjure you, And marr your match, and bang you soundly too; I like this Country Girle's condition well, She's faithfull, and a Lover but to one, Robin stands here to right both Grim and her. Grim. Master Parson, look you to my Love; Miller, here I stand with my Heart and my Hand in sweet Iugg's right, with thee to fight. Clack. Come let us to it then. They fight, Robin beateth the Miller with a Flayle, and felleth him. Rob. Now Miller, Miller, dustipoule, I'le clapper-claw your Iobbernoule. Short. Come Iugg, lets's leave these sencelesse Blocks, Giving each other blowes and knocks. Ione. I love my Grim too well to leave him so. Short. You shall not choose, come let's away. Shorthose pulleth Jugg after him, Robin beateth the Priest with his Flayle. Rob. Nay then Sir Priest I'le make you stay. Clack. Nay this is nothing Grim, wel'e not part I thought to have born it off with my backsword ward, and I receiv'd it upon my bare Costard. They fight again. Rob. What Miller are you up agin! Nay then my Flayle shall never lin, Untill I force one of us twain, Betake him to his heels amain. Robin beats the Miller again. Clack. Hold thy hands Grim, thou hast murdered me. Grim. Thou lyest, it is in my own offence I do it; get thee gone then; I had rather have thy room than thy company. Clack. Marry with all my heart; O! the Collier playeth the Devil with me. Rob. No, it is the Devil playeth the Collier with thee. Short. My bones are sore, I prethee Ione, Let's quickly from this place be gone, Nay come away, I love thee so, Without thee I will never go. Rob. What Priest still at your Lechery, Robin beats the Priest. I'le thresh you for your Knavery; If any ask who beat thee so, Tell them 'twas Robin Goodfellow. Shorthose runneth away. Grim. Oh Miller art thou gone, I am glad of it; I smell my own infirmity every stroke I struck at him: now Ione I dare boldly swear thou art my own, for I have won thee in the plain field; now Master Parson shall even strike it up; two or three words of his mouth will make her Gammer Grim all the daies of her life after. Rob. Here is two well-favoured Slaves, Grim and I may curse all good faces, And not hurt our own. Ione. What, my Love, how dost thou? Grim. Even as a Conqueror may do; Iugg, for thy sake I have made the Miller a poor Cripple all dayes of his life; good for nothing else but to be carried into the Spittle-house. Rob. I, there is one lye, for thou didst never hurt him. Ione. I am glad thou scapest my love, and wast not huit, Grim. Who, I hurt! Ione, thou knowest me not yet, thou mayest do better hereafter, I gave him five mortal wounds, the first five strokes I made at him. Rob. There are five lyes clapt into one for brevity sake. Grim. And presently upon the fifth blow I made a dangerous thrust at him, and violently overthrew him horse and foot, and there he lay. Rob. Nay, there you lye, the Collier is excellent To be Companion to the Devil himself. Grim. But where's Master Parson? Ione. He was well bang'd, and knew not who it was did it, And would have had me gone away with him: Mere lyeth his Nut-bag, and the Millers too, They had no leisure to take them away. Grim. The better for us Ione, there is good cracking work, it Will increase Houshold-stuff: Come, let's after the Parson, we will comfort him, and he shall couple us: I'le have Pounceby the Painter score upon our painted Cloath at home all the whole story of our going a nutting this Holy-rood day, and he shall paint me up triumphing over the Miller. Exeunt Grim and Ione. Rob. So let the Collier now go boast at home How he hath beat the Miller from his Love; I like this modest Country maid so well, That I believe I must report in hell Better of women than my Master can: Well, till my time's expired, I'le keep this Quarter, And night by night attend their merry meetings. Exit Robin. Enter Dunston with Earle Lacy sick. Dunston. Let not your sickness adde more feebleness Unto your weakned age, but give me leave To cure thy vain suspicious malladie, Thy eyes shall witness how thou art deceived, Misprizing thy fair Ladies chastity; For whilst we two stand closely here unseen, We shall espy them presently approach. Lacy. O shew me this thou blessed man of God, And thou shalt then make young my withered Age. Dunston. Mark the beginning, for here Musgrave commeth. Enter Musgrave alone. Musg. O thrice unhappy and unfortunate, That having fit occasion profer'd thee Of conference with beautious Honorea, Thou over-slipt it, and o're-slip'st thy self, Never since Wedlock tyed her to the Earle. Have I saluted her, although report Is blaz'd abroad of my unconstancy, This is her evening walk, and here will I Attend her comming forth, and greet her fairly Lacy. See Dunston how their youth doth blind our Age, Thou dost deceive thy self, and bringest me To see my proper shame and infamy. Enter Honorea. But here she comes, my hope, my fear, my love, Dunst. Here comes the unstained honor of thy Bed, Thy Eares shall hear her vertuous chast replies, And make thy heart confess thou dost her wrong. Honorea. Now modest love hath banisht wanton thoughts, And altered me from that I was before: To that chaste life I ought to entertain, My heart is tyed to that strick't form of life, That I joy only to be Lacy's wife. Lacy. God fill thy minde with these chaste vertuous thoughts. Musg. Oh now I see her, I am half ashamed, Of so long absence and neglect of speech; My dearest Lady, Patroness of Beauty, Let thy poor Servant make his true excuse. Hon. Musgrave, I easely take your excuse, Accusing my fond self for what is past. Musg. Long time we wanted opportunity; But now the forelock of well wishing time, Hath blest us both, that here without suspect We may renew the tenor of our loves. Lacy. O Dunston how she smiles to hear him speak! Hon. No Childe of fortune and inconstancy, Thou shalt not traine me, or induce my love To loose desires, or dishonoured thoughts, 'Tis God's own work that struck a deep remorse Into my tainted heart for my past folly. Musg. O thou confound'st me, speak as thou wert wont, Like Love herself, my lovely Honorea. Hon. Why, how now Musgrave, what esteem'st thou me! That thou provokest me, that first deny'dst me: I will not yield you reasons why I may not, More than your own, you told me why, you would not. Musg. By Heavens, by thee my Saint, my Happiness, No torture shall controll my heart in this, To teach my tongue deny to call thee Love. Hon. Well in regard that in my maiden-daies I lov'd thee well, now let me counsell thee, Reclaim these idle humors; know thy self; Remember me; and think upon my Lord; And let these thoughts bring forth those chaste effects, Which may declare thy change unto the world; And this assure thee, whilst I breath this aire, Earle Lacy's honour I will ne're impair. Exit Honorea. Dunst. Now your Eyes see that which your Heart believed not. Lacy. It is a miracle beyond the reach Of my capacitie, I could weep for joy, Would but my tears express how much I love her, Men may surmise amiss in jealousie, Of those that live in untouch'd honesty. Musg. Is she departed, and do I conceive This height of grief and do no violence Vnto my self, said she, I denyed her; Far be it from my heart to think that thought: All ye that, as I do, have felt this smart, Ye know how burdensome 'tis at my heart: Hereafter never will I prosecute This former motion, my unlawfull suite: But since she is Earle Lacy's vertuous wife, I'le live a private pensive single life. Ex. Musg. Dunst. God doth dispose all at his blessed will, And he hath chang'd their minds from bad to good, That we which see't may learn to mend our selves. Lacy. I'le reconcile my self to Musgrave's love, I will recant my false suspition, And humbly make my true submission. Exeunt both. Enter Marian chafing. Mar. Say'st thou thou'lt make the House too hot for me. I'le soon abroad and cool me in the aire. I'le teach him never scorn to drink his health Whom I do love, he thinks to overcrow me With words and blows, but he is in the wrong, Begin he when he dares: Oh he's too hot And angry to live long with Marian: But I'le not long be subject to his rage, Here 'tis shall rid him of his hatefull life, And bless me with the stile of Widow hood; 'Twas Harvey's work to temper it so well, The strongest poyson that he could devise, Enter Clinton. I have been too long subject to the Slave. But now I'le cast off that detested yoke. Clin. Musgrave I see is reconciled to the Earle, For now I met him walking with Lord Lacy; Sure this is Marian's Plott, and there she stands. What Love alone! Mar. I Captain, much disturb'd About the frantick Doctor's jealousie, Who, though he seemed content when thou wast there, He after fell reviling thee and me, Rob'd me of all my Iewels, locks his Plate In his own Trunk, and lets me only live To bear the idle Title of his Wife. Clin. Fair Marian, by a Souldier's loyal faith, If my imployment any way may help To set thee free from this Captivity, Vse me in any sort, command my Sword, I'le do't as soon as thou shalt speak the word. Mar. Now by my true Love, which I wish to thee, I conjure thee with resolution To slay that Monster, do not fail to do it, For if thou dost, I would I had not spoke it. Clin. Now try me, and when next we hap to meet, The Doctor lies stone dead at Clinton's feet, Mar. Nay now I see thou lovest me. Clin. Say no more; If thou dost loath him, he shall dye therefore. Mar. To morrow morning will he early rise To see Earle Lacy, meet him in the Cloyster, And make that place revenge his Sanctuary: This night will I break open all the Trunks, Rifle his Caskets, rob him of his Gold; And all the Doctors treasure shall be thine, If thou miscarry, yet this drink shall do it. Enter Castil. Cast. My wive's impatience hath left me alone, And made my Servant run I know not whither. Mar. Peace! here is our eye sore, Clinton leave us now. Clin. Nay now occasion smiles, and I will do it. Clinton draweth his Sword. Mar. Put up thy Sword, be it thy mornings work; Farewell to night, but fayle me not to morrow Clin. Farewell my Love, no rest shall close these eyes; Vntil the morning peep, and then he dyes. Exit Clinton. Cast. Now I remember I have quite out-run My time prefixt to dwell upon the earth; Yet Akercock is absent, where is he: Oh I am glad I am so well near rid Of my Earth's plague, and my lascivious dame. Mar. Hath he discovered my intendement, That he presageth his ensuing death? I must break off these fearfull meditations. Cast. How shall I give my verdict up to Pluto Of all these Accidents? Mar. Why, how now man! Cast. What my dear Dame, my reconciled Spouse! Vpon my Soul, my love to thee is more Now at this present, than 'twas e're before. Mar. He hath discry'd me sure, he sootheth me so. Cast. I love thee now, because I now must leave thee; This was the day of my Nativity, And therefore Sweet wife let us revell it. Mar. Nay, I have little cause to joy at all. Cast. Thou crossest still my Mirth with discontents, If ever heretofore I have displeased thee, Sweet Dame, I crave thy pardon now for all; This is my birth day, Girle, I must rejoyce, Ask what thou wilt, and I will give it thee. Mar. Should I but ask to lead a quiet life, You hardly would grant this unto your wife, Much less a thing that were of more import. Cast. Ask any thing, and try if I'le deny thee. Mar. Oh my poor Musgrave, how hast thou been wronged, And my fair Lady! Cast. Vse no Pteambles, But tell me plainly. Mar. Nay remember them, And joyn their slander to that love you owe me, And then old Lacye's jealousie Cast. What then? Mar. Nay now I see you will not understand me. Cast. Thou art too dark, speak plainly, and 'tis done. Mar. Then doom the Earle, and bless poor Musgrave's eyes With Honorea's love; for this in thy Hand's lyes. Cast. How should I doom him? Mar. How else, but to death? Cast. As if his life or death lay in my hands. Mar. He is thy Patient, is he not? Cast. He is. Mar. Then in thy hands lyes both his life and death, Sweet Love, let Marian begg it at thy hands; Why should the gray beard live to crosse us all? Nay now I see thee frown; thou wilt not do it. Cast. Fy, fy, Dame, you are too suspitious. Here is my hand, that thou may'st know I love thee, I'le poyson him this night before I sleep. Mar. Thou dost but flatter me! Cast. Tush, I have sworn it. Mar. And wilt thou do it? Cast. He is sure to dye. Mar. I'le kiss thy Lips for speaking that kind word; But do it, and I'le hang about thy neck, And curle thy hair, and sleep betwixt thy armes, And teach thee pleasures which thou never knewest. Cast. Promise no more, and trouble me no more, The longer I stay here, he lives the longer; I must go to him now, and now I'le do it: Go home, and hasten supper 'gainst I come, We will carrouse to his departing Soul. Mar. I will dear Husband, but I remember me; When thou hast poyson'd him, I'le poyson thee. Ex. Mar. Cast. O wonderfull how women can dissemble, Now she can kiss me, hang about my neck, And sooth me with smooth smiles and loud intreaties: Well, I have promis'd her to kill the Earle, And yet, I hope, ye will not think I'le do it, Yet I will sound the depth of their device, And see the issue of their bloody drift, I'le give the Earle, unknown to any man, A sleepy potion, which shall make him seem As if he were stark dead, for certain hours: But in my absence no man shall report, That for my Dame's sake I did any hurt. Exit Castiliano.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Enter Grim with Ione. Grim. Nay but Ione, have a care, bear a brain for all at once, 'tis not one hours pleasure that I suspect, more than your Mother's good countenance; if she be a sleep, we may be bold under correction, if she be awake, I may go my waies, and no body ask me, Grim whither goest thou: nay I tell you I am so well beloved in our Town, that not the worst dogg in the street will hurt my little finger. Ione. Why speak you this, you need not fear my Mother, For she was fast asleep four hours ago. Grim. Is she sure, did you hear her snort in her dead sleep; why then Ione I have an hours mirth for thee. Ione. And I a mess of Cream for thee. Grim. Why there is one for another then, fetch it Ione, we will eat and kiss, and be as merry Exit Ione for the Creame. as your Cricket; art thou gone for for it: well, go thy waies for the kindest Lass that ever poor Collier met withall; I mean for to make short work with her, and marry her presently; I'le single her out i'faith, till I make her beat double, and give the world to understand we will have a young Grim between us. Enter Ione with the Creame Ione. Look here my Love, 'tis sweetned for thy mouth. Grim. You have put none of your Love powder in it to make me enamourable of you, have you Ione, I have a simple pate to expect you. One knocketh at the door. Ione hark, my Braynes beat, my head works, and my mind giveth me, some Lovers of yours come sneaking hither now, I like it not, 'tis suspectious. One knocketh again. Ione. You need not fear it, for there is none alive Shall bear the least part of my heart from thee. Grim. Sayest thou so, hold there still, and who e're he be, open door to him. She openeth the door, enter Shorthose and Robin after him. Ione. what, Master Parson! are you come so late; You are welcome, here is none but Grim and I. Short. Ione, I'le no more a nutting go, I was so beaten to and fro; And yet who it was I do not know. Grim. What, Master Parson, are you come so late to say evening song to your Paritioners, I have heard of your Knavery, I give you a fair warning, touch her no lower than her Girdle, and no higher than her chin; I keep her lips and her hips for my own use; I do, and so welcome. Rob. This two hours have I dogg'd the Parson round About all Croydon, doubting some such thing. Short. No Grim, I here foreswear to touch Thy Ione, or any other such; Love hath been so cudgell'd out of me, I'le go no more to wood with thee. Rob. 'Twas Robin beat this holy mind into him, I think more cudgelling would make him more honest. Grim. You speak like an honest man, and a good Parson, and that is more; here is Ione's benevolation for us, a mess of Cream and so forth. Here is your place, Master Parson, stand on the t'other side of the Table Ione, eat hard to night that thou may marry us the better to morrow. Rob. What is my Brother Grim so good a fellow? They fall to the Creame. I love a mess of Cream as well as they; I think it were best I stept in and made one: Ho, ho, ho my Masters, no good Fellowship! Is Robin Goodfellow a Bug-bear grown. Robin falleth to ear. That he is not worthy to be bid sit down. Grim. O Lord save us! sure he is some Country-devil, he hath got a Russet-coat upon his face. Short. Now benedicite! who is this? I take him for some fiend I wiss, Oh for some holy-water here Of this same place this Sprite to clear. Rob. Nay fear not Grim, come fall unto your Creame, Tut, I am thy Friend, why dost not come and eat? Grim. I Sir, truly, Master Devil, I am well here, I thank you. Rob. I'le have thee come, I say, Why tremblest thou? Grim. No Sir, not I, 'tis a Palsie I have still: Truly, Sir, I have no great acquaintance with you. Rob. Thou shalt have better man e're I depart. Grim. I will not, and if I can choose. Rob. Nay come away, and bring your Love with you. Grim. Ione, you were best go to him Ione. Rob. What shall I fetch the man? the Cream is sweet. Grim. No, Sir I am coming; much good do't you: I had need of a long spoon now I go to eat with the Devil. Rob. The Parson's pennance shall be thus to fast: Come tell me Grim, doest thou not know me man? Grim. No truly Sir, I am a poor man, fetcheth my Living out of the fire; your Worship may be a Gentleman Devil for ought I know. Rob. Some men call me Robin Goodfellow. Grim. O Lord! Sir, Mr. Robert Goodfellow, you are very welcome, Sir. Rob. This half year have I lived about this Town, Helping poor Servants to dispatch their work, To brew and bake, and other Husbandry; Tut, fear not Maid, if Grim be merry, I will make up the Match between ye. Grim. There will be a Match in the Devil's name! Rob. Well now the night is almost spent, Since your affections all are bent To Marriage, and to constant Love, Grim, Robin doth thy Choyse approve, And there's the Priest shall marry you; Go to it, and make no mote ado: Sirrah, Sir Priest, go get you gone, And joyn both her and him anon; But ne're hereafter let me take you With wanton Love-tricks, lest I make you Example to all stone-priests ever, To deal with other mens loves never. Short. Valete vos, and God bless me, And rid me from his Company. Come Grim I'le joyn you hand in hand, In sacred Wedlock's holy band; I will no more a nutting go, That journey caused all this woe. Grim. Come, let's to hand in hand quickly, Master Robert you were ever one of the honestest merry Devils that ever I saw. Ione. Sweet Grim, and if thou lovest me let's away. Grim. Nay, now Ione, I spy a hole in your coat, if you cannot endure the Devil, you'l never love the Collier, why we two are sworn Brothers, you shall see me talk with him even as familiarly as if I should parbreak my mind and my whole stomach upon thee. Ione. I prethee do not Grim. Grim. Who, not I? O Lord! Mr. Robert Goodfellow, I have a poor Cottage at home, whither Ione and I will jog as merrily; we will make you no Stranger if you come thither, you shall be used as devilishly as you would wish i'faith; there is never a time my Cart commeth from London, but the Collier bringeth a Goose in his Sack and that, with the Giblets thereof, is at your service. Rob. This is more kindness Grim than I expected. Grim. Nay, Sir, if you come home, you shall find it true I warrant you, all my whole Family shall be at your Devilships pleasure, except my poor Ione here, and she is my own proper night geer. Rob. Gramercies, but away in hast, The night is almost spent and past. Grim. God be with you, Sir, I'le make as much hast about it as may be, for and that were once done, I would begin a new piece of work with you Ione. Exeunt all but Robin. Rob. Now joy betide this merry morn, And keep Grims forehead from the horn, For Robin bids his last adieu, To Grim and all the rest of you. Ex. Rob. Enter Clinton alone. Clin. Bright Lucifer go cochu thee in the Clouds, And let this morning prove as dark as night, That I unseen may bring to happy end The Doctor's murder, which I do intend: It's early yet, he is not so soon stirring; But stir he ne're so soon, so soon he dies; I'le walk along before the Pallace gate; Then shall I know how near it is to day, He shall have no means to escape away. Exit Clinton. Enter Castiliano. Cast. My Trunk's broke open, and my Iewels gone, My Gold and Treasure stolne, my House disspoyl'd Of all my Furniture, and nothing left, No not my Wife, for she is stoln away, But she hath pepper'd me. I feel it work, My Teeth are loose, and my Belly swell'd, My Entrails burn with such distemper'd heat, That well I know my Dame hath poyson'd me; When she spoke fairest, then she did this Act. When I have spoken all I can imagine, I cannot utter half that she intends; She makes as little poysoning of a man As to carrouse, I feel that this is true: Enter Clinton. Nay now I know too much of Women kind, Zoun's here's the Captain! what should he make here With his Sword drawn? there's yet more Villany. Clin. The morning is far spent, but yet he comes not! I wonder Marian sends him not abroad! Well Doctor, linger time and linger life, For long thou shalt not breath upon the earth. Cast. No, no, I will not live amongst ye long, Is that for me thou waitest thou bloody Wretch? Her Poyson hath prevented thee in Murther. Enter Earle Morgan, St. Dunston, with Honorea fainting, and Mariana. Now here be they suppose Earle Lacy dead, See how his Lady grieveth for that she wisheth? Dunst. My Lord of London, by his sudden death, And all the signs before his late departure, 'Tis very probable that he is poyson'd. Marian. Do you but doubt it! credit me my Lord, I heard him say, That drink should be his last, I heard my Husband speak it, and he did it. Cast. There is my old Friend, she alwaies speaks for me; Oh shameless Creature! was't not thy devise? Morg. Let not extremity of grief or'ewhelme thee, My dearest Honorea, for his death shall be Surely reveng'd with all severity Upon the Doctor, and that suddenly. Clin. What Fortune's this, that all these come this way To hinder me, and save thy life to day. Hon. My gracious Lord, this dolefull accident Hath rob'd me of my joy; And royal Earle, Though in thy life thou did'st suspect my love, My grief and tears suspitions shall remove. Mar. Madam to you and to your Father's love, I owe as much &amp; more than my own life, Had I ten Husbands should agree to do it, My gracious Lord you presently should know it. Cast. I! there's a Girle: Think you I did not well To live with such a Wife, to come from Hell. Mar. Look, look, my Lord, there stands the Murderer. Cast. How am I round beset on every side! First, that same Captain, here stands to kill me, My Dame she hath already poysoned me, Earle Morgan he doth threaten present death, The Countess Honorea, in revenge Of Lacy, is extremely incens'd against me; All threatens, none shall do it, for my date Is now expired, and I must back to Hell. And now my Servant wheresoe're thou be, Come quickly Akercock, and follow me; Lordings adieu, and my curst Wife farewell, If me ye seek, come follow me to Hell. The Ground opens, and he falls down into it. Morg. The Earth that opened, now is clos'd again! Dunst. It is God's judgement for his grievous sins. Clin. Was there a Quagmire, that he sunk so soon? Hon. O miracle! now may we justly say, Heavens have reveng'd my Husband's death this day. Morg. Alass poor Marian! we have wrong'd thee much, To cause thee march thy self to any such. Mar. Nay let him go, and sink into the ground, For such as he are better lost then found; Now Honorea we are freed from blame, And both inrich'd with happy Widows names. Enter Earl Lacy with Forest, Musgrave. Lacy. O lead me quickly to that mourning train, Which weep for me, that am revived again. Hon. Marian, I shed some tears of perfect grief. She falleth into a Sound. Morg. Do not my Eyes deceive me? liveth my Son? Lacy. My Lord, and Father, both alive and well Recovered of my weakness: where's my wife? Mar. Here is my Lady, your beloved wife, Half dead to hear of your untimely end. Lacy. Look on me Honorea; see thy Lord: I am not dead, but live to love thee still. Dun. 'Tis God disposeth all things as he will, He raiseth those the wicked wish to fall. Clin. Zounds, I still watch on this inclosed ground; For if he rise again, I'le murder him. Hon. My Lord, my tongue's not able to report Those joys my heart conceives to see thee live! Dunst. Give God the glory: he recovered thee, And wrought this judgement on that cursed man, That set debate and strife among ye all. Morg. My Lord, our eyes have seen a miracle, Which after-ages ever shall admire, The Spanish Doctor, standing here before us, Is sunk into the bowels of the earth, Ending his vile life by a viler death. Lacy. But, gentle Marian, I bewail thy loss, That wer't Maid, Wife, and Widow, all so soon. Mar. 'Tis your recovery that joys me more Than grief can touch me for the Doctor's death; He never lov'd me whil'st he liv'd with me, Therefore the less I mourn his Tragedy. Morg. Henceforth we'l strictlier look to Strangers lives, Now they shall marry any English Wives: Now all men shall record this fatal day, Lacy revived, the Doctor sunk in Clay. The Trumpets sound, exeunt all but Dunstan. Dunst. Now is Earl Lacy's House fill'd full of joy, He and his Lady wholy reconcil'd, Their jars all ended; those that were like men Transformed, turn'd unto their shapes again: And Gentlemen, before we make an end, A little longer yet your patience lend, That in your friendly censures you may see What the infernal Synod do decree, And after judge, if we deserve to name This Play of ours, The Devil and his Dame. Exit. It thunders and lighteneth; enter Pluto, Minos, Ãacus, Rhadamanthus, with Furies bringing in Malbecco's ghost. Pluto. Minos, is this the day he should return And bring us tidings of his Twelve month spent. Enter Belphagor like a Devil, with Horns on his head, and Akerkok. Minos. It is, great King, and here Belphagon comes. Pluto. His Visage is more ghastly than it was wont. What Ornaments are those upon his head? Bel. Hell, I salute thee, now I feel my self Rid of a thousand torments; O vile Earth, Worse for us Devils, then Hell it self for men! Dread Pluto, hear thy Subject's just Complaint, Belph. kneeleth to Pluto. Proceeding from the anguish of my Soul, O never send me more into the Earth, For there dwells dread, and horror more then here. Pluto. Stand forth Belphagor, and report the truth Of all things have betide thee in the World. Bel. When first, great King, I came into the Earth, I chose a Wife both young and beautifull, The only Daughter to a noble Earl: But when the night came, that I should her bed, I found another laid there in her stead, And in the morning when I found the change, Though I deny'd her, I was forc'd to take her; With her I lived in such a milde estate, Used her still kindly, loved her tenderly; Which she requited with such light regard, So loose demeanour, and dishonest life, That she was each man's whore that was my wife: No hours but Gallants flock'd unto my house, Such as she fancied for her loathsome lust, With whom, before my face, she did not spare To play the Strumpet; yea, and more than this, She made my house a stue for all resorts, Herself a Bawd to other's filthiness; Which if I once began but to reprove, Oh! then her Tongue was worse than all the rest, No ears with patience would endure to hear her, Nor would she ever cease till I submit, And then she would speak me fair, but wish me dead: A hundred drifts she laid to cut me off, Still drawing me to dangers of my life; And now my Twelve-month being near expir'd, She poysoned me; and least that means should fail, She entic'd a Captain to have murdered me In brief, whatever Tongue can tell, All that may well be spoken of my Dame. Aker. Poor Akercock was fain to fly her sight, For ne're an hour but she laid on me, Her Tongue and Fist walked all so nimblely. Pluto. Doth then Belphagor this report of thine Against all Women hold in general? Bel. Not so, great Prince, for as 'mongst other Creatures, Under that Sex are mingled good and bad, There are some women vertuous, chast and true, And to all those the Devil will give their due: But, Oh my Dame! born for a song to man, For no mortality would endure that, Which she a thousand times hath offered me. Pluto. But what new shapes are those upon thy Head? Bel. These are the ancient arms of Cuckoldry, And these my Dame hath kindly left to me, For which Belphagor shall be here derided, Vnless your great infernal Majestie Do solemnly proclame, no Devil shall scorn Hereafter still to wear the goodly horn Plu. This for thy service I will grant thee freely, All Devils shall, as thou dost like horns wear, And none shall scorn Belphagor's arms to bear; And now Malbecco, bear thy latest doom, Since that thy first Reports are justified By after-proofs, and Women's looseness known, One Plague more will I send upon the earth, Thou shalt assume a light and fiery shape, And so for ever live within the world. Dive into Womens thoughts, into mens hearts, Raise up false rumours, and suspicious fears, Put strange inventions into each man's mind; And for these Actions they shall alwaies call thee By no name else but fearfull Iealousie: Go Iealousie, be gone, thou hast thy charge, Go range about the World that is so large. And now for joy Belphagor is return'd, The Furies shall their tortures east away, And in Hell wee will make it Holy-day. It thundereth and lighteneth; exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
