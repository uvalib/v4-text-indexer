Next be sure to keep them continually at Game, or Drinking; Uurge 'em to quarrell, and then take up the businesse, but not without profit to the Brotherhood; That what quarrels soever arise among our selves, must not cause us to fight with one another, but the Coines of the Bubble or Byshop must make us friends; That you must not pay your Coachman but with kicks, unlesse your Bubble or Byshop do, and then he owes you a fare; That your Bubble, or Byshop, and you, keep but one Purse, though two Drabs; That when you have dreined him dry, you make him free, if he sue for it, if not let him keep Company with the Titteretues, and live upon the sin of Sodom; That you I take your chance of the day, where there is need of dipping, without grumbling. That while you can stand With sword in your hand, You'l not be in aw Of the Halberteere Law; Kiss thisâNow y'are free [Kisses the Hilts Of the Huffs company. Tra.

Bring forth your Prongs Neighbours; All men stand up for the truth: And he that will lie on the Sunday, is not to be trusted the week after, what say you Neighbours? 2 I say a Sundaies lie may go as far as a work-daies, my reason is, it has more leasure to travell. 3 For my part neighbours let them lie that will I have no more to doe with a lie, then a lie has to do with me; if any lies with my wife, it shall go hard but ile do as much with his. 1 I, if he have one Neighbour. 3 Why, if he have none Neighbour, I must go without; no man will be a slave I think. 2 A slave! who has such a mind let him have it still: For my part Neighbours, Ile worke hard, earn my bread with the sweat of my browes, none shall eat away the fruit of my labour, but I will sit down when it is done, and laugh, in despight of all the Kasars in the World. 4 Hold a pluck there Neighbour, 'tis ill playing with edge-tooles; that word despight comes not in handsomely, and may bring us all to the Pot. 3 What! have wee a scab'd sheep amongst us? lets cleere our flock of him. 4 Hold Neighbour, hold, I am for you with all my heart, but give me leave to speak to you; I am but a fool 'tis confest, but children and fooles tell truth sometimes, you know. Omnes. And what of that, and what of that. 4 I say again, 'tis dangerous medling with edge-tooles; there's store of trees here abouts, and there may bee Gibbets made of them, and you know well enough what fruit Gibbets bring forth; I say no more, but be carefull what you do. Omnes. Away with him, away with him. 4 One word more Neighbours, one word more; it is not well to mocke our Superiours, much worse to threaten them: for as I have heard, there was a suit at Law commenced about a Part. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, how man, how! 4 Why, I will tell you Neighbours, be but patient; there was a fellow, Ile not tell his name, was pissing against the wall, the Mayor came by, now you know the Proverb, tell a tale to a Mare, and 'twill let a fart; but here the case alters, for the fellow let the fart, and the Mayor took it in the nose, and caused the fellow to bee carried to the Town Hall, as Prisoner. 3 The Mayor was a Horse, or a Whorson knave, what's this to us? 4 Now toth' suit. 2 'Tis worn out, weel have none on't. 4 Neighbours lay down your Prongs, take my devise; 'Tis an old Proverb, be merry and wise. Omnes. Away with him, away with him, we will break the Cords of our slavery. Exeunt. Enter Jocky, and Folly, and Anything. Fol.

Soon. Am not I a man? Lay. You think so husband, I warrant. Soon. Why, a King's no more. Lay. Nay, is he that husband? troth I dare say our man William is as good a man as the best of you; for as they say, a man is a man and he has but a hose on's head. Soon. Well, I am resolv'd William shall forth. Lay. Forth, how do you meane forth?

Enter Downfall and Worn-out. Down. You see what he has brought me to, my Crutches; I was ere held an able man you know; Had my tongue at Command, and my head too, But now they both are so enfeebled I Have scarce the use of either; if I had It were all one, the Countrey People are Be witcht into beliefe, they have as much Reason and Law as I, and will become Their own Sollicitors, and Councell too. I cannot last long, but expect still when My Crutches will deceive me, and I fall To th'ground for ever. Worn. âI am brought to nothing As well as you, I little thought a Scotchman Could ere have dreind my Veins, and purse so dry, I am not worth the ground I go on; so Dejected are my thoughts; my spirit lost, And all the hopes of my recovery Extinct and buried. Down. I should not have known you, Had you not told me who you were; you are So changed from your self. Oh those were times, Worthy to call to mind, (though to our griefe) When you and I, like Twins, deriv'd a being From one anothers sustenance, the Monopolies That you projected, and I perfected! Like two expert Limners, the one imploy'd To fashion th'face, the other to finish it. Wor. âI, those were times indeed, but all I got Then, has been since consumed; and I guess You are not much the better; I am weary I protest of my life, and would thank him Would do me so much good as take it from me. Dow. âPatience is the best remedy where no Better can be obtain'd; 'tis vaine to crave The thing we want when 'tis not to be had; Your dancing daies are done, and all the breath The Scot has left me scarce will heat my fingers. Worn. âAnd my affliction does the more increase To see my friends disabl'd, as I am, From helping one another, 'tis a griefe That's inexpressible, and not for cure. Down. âWhat Fortune sowres, content must sweeten, he Is the best man o'rcomes his misery. Exeunt. Enter Smallfaith and his wife. Smal. âFor my part, I am but a man, and I owe but a death, let them take it, as they say they will, give 'um good on't, let them come, let them comeâwhere are they? stand, stand, stand. Wife. Husband now you talk of standing, pray let me lye down, and then let 'em do their worst, I defie 'em. Smal. And so do I, wee'l to the Terret, Woman, and there we are secur'd 'gainst Devill, and Parsevant. Wife. âI'm weary'd off my legs with doing nothing but running up and down in e'ry Nooke and Corner like a Rat for feare of catching. Smal. âThey are comming, they are comming; let me come in woman, let me come in. Wife. I would you would come in husband once, you have been out long enough to small purpose I'm sure. Exeunt. Enter Surehold, Resolution. Res. Beleeve it, their Design aimes at our ruine; And though the Cord they make be some what finer Than Ordinary, 'Twill choak us at the last; I hold a naked freedome better far Than an adorned Prison; golden fetters And Iron ones produce a like effect, What differs them's but curiosity. Sure. Into what a Lethargy has these rabble Scots Betray'd the peoples senses? tell them on't And they'l abuse you for't. Nay, though they see Distraction brought unto their very doores, They'l look on't, and not know it till they feele it, And then will tamely kiss the Rod that whipt 'em. A Nation proud and Arrogant as the Beggar, That when h'as got a Bonnet 'bove his wearing, Will scarce bow to the Giver. All the service They ever did this Nation was to help The people eat their victuals, and share their fortunes. Res. Th'are good for nought, but to eat, louze, and sleep, And stinck a street up. Tell you stories of Don John of Austria, the Magull, great Cham, Their valour at Madril, Levant, or where You will, and this in some blind Chimney Corner In fume and smoake, rouz'd up with lanted Ale, 'Till that their faces do resemble th'Towns They set on fire; And yet dare not encounter A Rat or Weesell. Sure. âYet the world reports Them, men for siege the best, and can endure The greatest hardship. Reso. Very true, if they May but ly still they'l feed on one another, Rather than venture on their Enemy To get the least Provision, and indeed The worst will serve their turne, for they are men Loves any thing but beating, yet they'l take That too if need be; take 'em down a little, And you may fillip dead a score of them. It is a shame the English should become Such mules to such base burdens; I'm resolv'd To turne the Chance o'th' Dy that favours them, Though to the hazard of my being. Sure. â'Twill Be tane a peece of service fit for Chronicle, And you shall want no furtherance. Reso. If I bring not The Souldier, Doctors, and their Crue of Cheaters As tamely to be hang'd as puppy Dogs, Let me receive no credit from you after. Exeunt. Enter Soonegul'd and a Seminary Priest going to weigh the Covenant with the Popes Bull. Soon. Sir, though I hate your Bulls, and your Decoyes, And know you have two ends to all your waies; I feare you not, for Truth will shew her selfe In spight of all the clouds you cast upon her. Sem. You are in th'right. Truth will appeare, and that To th'shame of your trim'd Covenant; for though She be but plaine, she is more glorious Than all the gloss and Colours that sets forth That new devise, Created to deceive Poore simple people, and at last your selves. Soon. These are but bandying, Ile pursue my wager. Sem. Ile venture ten pound more y'are lost in weight. Soon. You'l lose your selfe sir with your confidence. Sem. Bar treachery and I care not. Exeunt. Enter Trapheire, Witwud, and Townshift. Wit. I cannot endure this fighting Coz, a Dad. Tra. Pox take your Dad; is that an Oath for a Gentleman? A Lad at ten sweares more profoundly; you'l Be quarrelling, and then you dare not fight; As though I were a wall of Steele or Brass, To stand betwixt you, and receive the Darts Cast at you; Sir, why did your Cowship send An Answer to your Challenge, if you found Your bloud so Coole and Phlegmatick? Wit. 'Twas your doingâI had not had the heart else. [aside. Town. For preservation of your honour sir Could you do less than Answer him? Wit. What was he That brought the Challenge? Town. Pinckcarcase by name. Wit. A devillish name, and full of devillish ends; This fighting is not lawfull; prethee Coz Take up the matter, I have little maw to't. Town. What, now the Hostage Reputation Is past, will you Recant, Reneage, Revoke, Recoyle, Revert? stand to your Principles. Wit. I shall not stand an inch of ground beleeve me. Tra. 'Tis pitty th'art worth any; let me see, How shall we do't with Honour? Wit. 'Tis no matter For that thing Honour; let her walk alone, I don't desire her Company on such tearmes, Sweet Coz, sweet Coz. Tra. Let me seeâI'm resolv'd That you shall fight him. Wit. Coz, I had forgot I sweare, a strange infirmity, that is I zound when as I heare a Gun shot off, And tremble at a Pistols, all my senses Become as uselesse. Town. Why, 'twas your own motion. Wit. No matter, 'tis but so much charges lost, I will not fight with Bullets, I've more conscience. Tra. Why, then you must prepare a Case of Rapiers, For Townshift and my selfe, ours are grown dull With often usage. Wit. Oh, the better Coz! They'l do less mischiefe. Tra. Then your fencing Master Must make you at your Chamber fit for th'field. Wit. That's past his skill I'm sure; more charges Coz. Tra. It cannot be avoided if you mean To fight on foot, and put off your Horse combate. Wit. In my mind 'tis horse-play to fight on foot; But hark you Coz, don't you make winking at That Weapon ye call sharp, I'm not so set. Tra. Fye, winking, No, how will you see to hit him: Wit. No matter so he hit not me; but mayn't I Bar Points being the Challenged? Tra. That's base, and Player-like. Wit. I'de rather play so, than worke otherwise. Town. Come, come, resolve, you know the time draws neere. Wit. I would it did not, I love not to think on't; Can we throw nothing in Times-way to make Him stumble, and stop a little. Tra. Resolve upon your weapon ere he be Furnish'd with horse and Pistols. Town. Ile lay my life he's that already, then 'Twill be unworthy in you toâ Wit. Good sir, talk not to me of Worthies, my Father was none of the Nine; he ne'r kept Company with your Huffs, nor Puffs; he could drinke in a Taverne and ne're quarrell about the Reckoning, he liv'd without knocks, and dy'd in the love of his Parish. Tra. But he has left a quarrelsome son behind Must pay for all. Wit. I sha'n't stand much upon That point, so I may be discharg'd from beatings; Methinks a skin set out with Eylet holes Appeares not handsome, nor a face to be Painted with black and blew, I hate those colours. Town. What will you give him shall take up the business without loss to your honour? Wit. A man cannot lose That which he never had; My Father was A man of Bags, and might have been a Knight When Knighthoods went a begging. Town. But to the matter, What say you to my proposition? Wit. Troth. It sounds well, let me see now what in Conscience You will demand? Town. But twenty peeces. Wit. So; To save a man from beating, very good! How many such d'ye meet with in the yeare? Town. Hundreds, hundreds sir. Tra. Men must live Coz, men must live. Wit. Any where but on me (good Coz;) but sir, Before my Coz here, Ile give you ten. Tra. Ten is too little in all conscience Coz. Town. Consider sir the danger. Wit. And the Charge Already I've been for horse and Pistols; But those I hope you will return me, when The peace is made. Tra. Not one, expect not one, Th'are forfeit Goods to us Lords of the Soile. Town. 'Tis true, y'ave been at charges, and for that Reason Ile undertake it at your rate; Forbid, but I should beare a Conscience too. Meet us at th'Mairmaid. Tra. At the houre of twelve. Town. The precise time. Tra. Cozen, he will deserve it. Wit. Would I had his Art To live by when I and my fortunes part. Exeunt. Enter Wantwit, Drawforth, Pinckcarcase. Pinc. He is the Challenged, and justly may Designe the way of fighting, and the Place; But though you have provided us with Horses, Swords, Pistols and so forth, yet there's a thing Cal'd money, we do want, put case he should Fall by your hand, in what a case were we? Drawf. Suppose that you should fall; âI, there's the Danger. Drawf. We must fly for't, and that we cannot do Conveniently, without a sum, the Oratory Of Silver makes our passage free and safe, The want of it detaines us; open, open Your close-mouth'd bags, and let them speake to us. Want. Troth Gentlemen, Ile tell you, and I lie not, Th'ave got a hoarsenesse since they came to Town, And speak so low, a man can hardly heare 'em. Pinc. One Mortgage sir will raise their voice againe. Want. Well, well, he might have ta'ne another way To worke; had I been he, and he been me, I would have askt him Mercy. Drawf. But you see He is a man of spirit, spirit, sir! Want. I would he had no more then I, a gnat Is better furnisht; I have heard my Mother Protest, and solemnly, I had a heart No bigger than a hazell Nut. Pinc. âWhy, saw she't? Want. No, but she felt it; 'tis an imperfection In Nature I can't help, and 'tis as cold I warrant as a Cucumber. Drawf. And riseth So little in your stomack! Want. Troth, as little As may be sir; how shall I heat it Gentlemen? Drawf. Drink wine and Drab. Want. Why, so I do you know; Yet when the flame of drinking's o'r, I fall Into the Noose of Taverns, like a Pigeon. Pinc. Only then y'ad best fight when y'are drunke. Want. And so Be hang'd when I am sober; no, I beare Too great a Conscience. Drawf. If it be a burthen Too hard to beare, wee'l teach you how to throw It off, and live as we do without any. Want. Take up this quarrell Gentlemen, and have My heart for ever. Pinc. What to do, to throw The hounds ye starve? yet that so little, 'twill Not be a mouthfull; 'tis your money we Value the most, let your heart go as't came. Want. Why, I shall mortgage next weeke. Pinc.

And now is fit for no place except Bedlam: Here is another, a man you would think [to Anything The Devill could not worke upon, and yet These Scotch ones have.

What is that Gentleman? [To Worn-out. Resol. Do you conceive him one? have they left ought Upon him like a Creature? may we sweare He is a perfect man, no Ghost? 'tis hard.

When they had thus Spread their infection, they begin to thinke Their safety would not last without the Souldier; And to that end and purpose does perswade The giddy People, which they had before Distemper'd, with their Poysons, to receive This man of Feather, as their grand Protector: They take him, and to Covenant they go; Two hundred thousand pounds! (a sum would buy Their Kingdome) must be raised and paid to them. Do. Very fine. Resol. But marke sir the event, I am resolv'd to open what they did For all this Money. Do. 'Twill do well indeed.

I now proceed to that; I found 'um sir, Like Bull-rushes, that tremble if the wind But blow on them, they run and tumbl'd o're The necks of one another, like to tiles A storme forces from houses tops; this any thing But man, who own'd the name of their Protector, In the most abject'st manner, and beneath The Spirit of a man, threw at my feet. His Sword, and himselfe too, on single tearmes, Without a stroke; Scarefoole they call him, and They must be Citizens or none that feare him; A Rat shall make him run to his own Country. Scare.

No. I am a publike Notary by profession, And dare speake nothing but the truth; the wager Past on this Gentlemans side, the Popes Bull weighed It down by much, the other was not worth In weight a Penny loafe. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha! Sure. But what make you here sir? Sem. Not to do harme sir. Do. Stay not here upon. Your perill sir, your Bulls have too long tailes. Sem. I stay but for a winde sir. Exit Seminary. Soon. I must confess we have been much deluded, Cheated, and Cozen'd by these perjur'd Scots, Under the shew of zeale and honesty. Lay. Hang 'em Rogues, they complaine they are pillaged, you made 'em not bare enough sirs, you should have taken their skins off too, they would have made monsters of us, but truly my husband is a Naturall man, and I am his own wife; I hope you do not thinke we are otherwise than we should be. Mrs Smal. I have a husband here too, helpe his head, he was a Man once, and I was a Woman, as this Gentleman the Courtier knew well enough, but now I am no-body, thanke yon pick-purses; Pray spare 'em not, I'm sure they would not spare me when time was, do what I could. Sure. Take them hence, there will be order shortly To pack 'em to some forraigne parts, they are But Caterpillers, and what place soe're They come at will be th'worse for't; take 'em hence. Joc., Bil. A mercy, mercy, mercy. Exeunt Scots. Omnes. You have done Justice. Sure. Y'ave seene these Scots defected, Gentlemen, And what d'you find 'em now to be, but Rascals? Meere Mountebanks, that has instead of Cure Bred strange Diseases, and distempers 'mongst you; Juglers, that look'd you in the face, and told You a fine tale, to keepe your senses busie, While they did pick your Pockets. Lay. Our Pockets say you sir? I, and something else too, could They have come at it; but soft, soft, two words to a bargain. Sure. Master Small faith, we shall do what lies in us, Upon your Recantation, to bring You into favour with the Common Wealth, And seat you as before, as Capable Of her Preferment. Smal. I thanke you. His Wife. Blessing on your hearts. Sure. We make the same profession sir to you, On the like tearmes. You may do much Upon the giddy People, by th'example Of your own Reformation. Any. Sir, I shall Do what befits an honest man (abus'd) And servant to the Common Wealth. Do. And you sir, Are not exempted here the benefit Of favour if you will take hold of it. Soone. I thanke you. Lay. I, and hold it fast husband; had I a good thing to handle, I'd make much on't a long time I warrant you. Sure. As for these Gentlemen here, Master Downfall, And Master Worn-out, we shall do our best To set the one upon his legs agen; And restore th'other, though not to his full Ability, yet to a health contentable. Down. Worn. We are your servants. Sure. When all our minds and hearts are firmly knit, Let the Scot do his worst, by Sword or Wit. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
