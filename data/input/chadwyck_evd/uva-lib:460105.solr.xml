Exhibited at the Megalesian Games, Sextus Julius CÃ¦sar and Cn. Cornelius Dolabella, Curule Ãdiles: It was not acted through: The Musick, composed for Equal Flutes, by Flaccus, Freedman to Claudius: It is entirely from the Greek of Apollodorus: Criticks differ about the name of the Greek Poet from whom this play was taken. It is generally said to be Apollodorus; and most agree that this Comedy was not taken, like the four first of our author, from Menander. It was acted first without a Prologue, Cn. Octavius and T. Manlius, Consuls; and brought on again at the Funeral Games of Ãmilius Paulus: It did not please: It was acted a third time, Q. Fulvius and L. Marcius, Curule Ãdiles: Principal Actor, L.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. This play is call'd The Step-Mother. When first It was presented, such a hurricane, Calamitas. This word is used in the same sense in the first scene of the Eunuch.âNothing can be more evident than that this was the prologue to the second attempt to exhibit this comedy. A tumult so uncommon interven'd, It neither could be seen, nor understood: So taken were the people, so engag'd By a rope-dancer!âIt is now brought on As a new piece: and he who wrote the play, Suffer'd it not to be repeated then, That he might profit by a second sale. See the last note to the second prologue. According to Vossius, the Step-Mother was not attempted to be revived till after the representation of the Brothers. If so, they had already seen all the rest of Terence's pieces. Dacier.Others, his plays, you have already known; Now then, let me beseech you, know this too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANOTHER PROLOGUE. These two prologues are by some blended together, but most learned and judicious editors make two of them. Faernus says that in some copies the name of L. Ambivius is over them, in great letters; thus, L. AMBIVIUS PROLOGUS: and the same distinction is made in the Basilican copy. Eugraphius says positively that the prologue was spoken by Ambivius Turpio. Cooke. I come a pleader, Orator ad vos venio. Madam Dacier, and some who follow her, translate Orator by the word Ambassador. Her explanation of the original (though in this instance, as well as many others, she does not acknowledge it) is taken from Donatus. But what is very extraordinary, Donatus, in his comment on the very next line, gives the word a quite different signification; and tells us that Orator signifies a person entrusted with the defence of a cause; in one word, a Pleader: and that Exorator signifies him who has gained the cause. The word is undoubtedly used in this latter sense in the Prologue to the Self-TormentorâOratorem voluit esse me, non Prologumâand it seems to be the best and easiest construction in this place also. in the shape of prologue: Let me then gain my cause, and now grown old Experience the same favour as when young; Who then recover'd many a lost play, Breath'd a new life into the scenes, and sav'd The author, and his writings from oblivion. Of those, which first I studied of CÃ¦cilius, A famous comick Poet among the Romans. His chief excellencies are said to have been the gravity of his stile, and the choice of his subjects. The first quality was attributed to him by Horace, Tully, &amp;c. and the last by Varro. In argumentis CÃ¦cilius poscit palmam, in ethesi Terentius.ââIn the choice of subjects CÃ¦cilius demands the preference, in the manners Terence.â âMadam Dacier indeed renders in argumentis âin the disposition of his subjects.â But the words will not bear that construction. Argumentum, I believe, is uniformly used for the argument itself, never implies the conduct of itâas in the Prologue to the Andrian, non tam dissimili argumentoââin argument less different.ââBesides, the disposition of the subject was the very art attributed by the criticks of those days to Terence, and which Horace mentions in the very same line with the gravity of CÃ¦cilius, distinguishing them as the several characteristicks of each writer. Vincere CÃ¦cilius gravitate, Terentius arte. See Hurd's notes to the Epistle to Augustus. In some I was excluded; and in some Hardly maintain'd my ground. But knowing well The variable fortunes of the Scene, I was content to hazard certain toil For an uncertain gain. I undertook To rescue those same plays from condemnation, And labour'd to reverse your sentence on them; That the same Poet might afford me more, And no ill fortune damp young Genius in him. My cares prevail'd; the plays were heard; and thus Did I restore an Author, nearly lost Through the malevolence of adversaries, To study, labour, and the Poet's art. But had I at that time despis'd his plays, Or labour'd to deter him from the task, It had been easy to have kept him idle, And to have scar'd him from attempting more: For my sake, therefore, deign to hear with candour The suit I mean to offer to you now. Once more I bring The Step-Mother before you, Which yet in silence I might never play; So did confusion crush it: which confusion Your prudence may allay, if it will deign To second our endeavours.âWhen I first Begun to play this piece, the sturdy Boxers, (The Dancers on the Rope expected too) Th'increasing crouds, the noise, and women's clamour Oblig'd me to retire before my time. I, upon this occasion, had recourse To my old way. I brought it on again. In the first act I please: meanwhile there spreads A rumour of the Gladiators: then The people flock together, riot, roar, And fight for places. I meanwhile my place Could not maintainâTo-day there's no disturbance; All's silence and attention; a clear stage: There is great force and eloquence in the actor's affecting a concern for the sacred festivals, which were in danger of being deprived of their chief ornaments, if by too great a severity they discouraged the Poets, who undertook to furnish the plays during the celebrity. Dacier.'Tis your's to give these games their proper grace. Let not, oh let not the Dramatick Art Fall to a few! Let your authority Assist and second mine! If I for gain Ne'er over-rated my abilities, If I have made it still my only care To be obedient to your will, oh grant That he who hath committed his performance To my defence, and who hath thrown himself On your protection, be not giv'n to scorn, And foul derision of his envious foes! Admit this plea for my sake, and be silent; That other Poets may not fear to write, That I too may hereafter find it meet To play new pieces, Pretio emtas meo. These words I have rendered literally, tho' there is great dispute among commentators concerning them. Donatus, and, after him, Madam Dacier, explains pretio by Ã¦stimatione pretii, importing that Ambivius valued the play, when the Ãdiles were to purchase it. Madam Dacier therefore supposes the case to be thus. When the Ãdiles had a mind to purchase a copy for the Stage, they gave it to the Master of the Company, to peruse, and set a price upon it. If it failed, the master was bound to return the money to the Magistrates; which made it the interest of the Actors to support the piece, as the loss, if it was rejected, fell upon themselves.âThis it must be owned is ingenious, but has nothing to support it but conjecture. We are entirely unacquainted with the nature of these transactions between the Ãdiles, Players, and Poet, and therefore cannot pronounce with certainty about them. Besides, I believe it will be hard to find an instance where Pretium is put for Ãstimatio Pretii. I am therefore more inclined to think, that on some occasions the Ãdiles, on others the Master of the Company bought the play, of which last kind was the purchase of the Step-Mother. But how in either case, if it was not received by the publick, the Poet could claim a right to a second sale, as is mentioned in the first prologue, is a matter not easily determined at this distance of time. Patrick. Madam Dacier's reasoning on this dark point of theatrical history is certainly inconclusive; not only for want of proof, but because no method of settling the assize of plays could be more unworthy the Magistrate, more detrimental to Authors, or more hurtful to the credit of the Stage: for if the Actor was to abide by the loss, his interest would incline him to set the very lowest value on the piece. âTaking the whole prologue together, may not one conjecture, that the first time a play was exhibited it was purchased, as is mentioned in other prologues, by the Ãdiles: but if it failed, or, for the sake of Gladiators and Rope-dancers, was then refused a hearing, the Poet had a right to withdraw his piece without returning the copy-money; and if it was brought on again by the manager, it was at his own hazard and expence? This conjecture explains the passage in the first prologue concerning a second sale, and gives an additional force to every thing urged by Ambivius in the second; in which, supposing the actor to be speaking to the audience concerning a theatrical usage with which they were all familiarly acquainted, the whole obscurity of both the prologues vanishes. We immediately comprehend the manner of his revival of the plays of CÃ¦cilius, and see how essentially his interest is concerned in the reception of this of Terence. It gives us also a very high opinion of the penetration and humanity of Ambivius. From these two prologues, and some passages in Horace, we may collect that riots, parties, &amp;c. were as common in Rome as in England; and that a first night was as terrible, and the town as formidable to CÃ¦cilius, and Terence, as to the puny authors of our days. The high reputation of Ambivius Turpio, (the actor who spoke this Prologue, and probably the Manager of the Company) as well as the esteem which Terence had for him, is evident; and we conceive no unfavourable idea of the town-criticks of those times, who could listen to such a plea urged by the Actor, and so candidly acquiesce in all that he said in his own commendation. We have seen indeed, and it is to be hoped shall see again, an acting manager in our time, to whom modern authors have as much reason to be partial, as Terence to Ambivius: but though he has helped out many a lame play with a lively prologue, I believe he would hardly venture to make such an address to the publick as this now before us. bought at my expence.</field>

I warn you therefore, and most earnestly Conjure you, to have pity upon none. But plunder, fleece, and beggar ev'ry man That falls into your pow'r. Phi. What! spare none? Syra. None. For know, there is not one of all your sparks But studies to cajole you with fine speeches, And have his will as cheaply as he can. Shou'd not You then endeavour to fool Them? Phi.

Save you, Parmeno! Syra. Save you, good Parmeno! Par. And save you, Syra! âTell me, Philotis, where have you been gadding, Taking your pleasure this long time? Phi. I've taken No pleasure, Parmeno, indeed. I went With a most brutal Captain hence to Corinth. There have I led a wretched life with him, For two whole years. Par. Ay, ay, I warrant you That you have often wish'd to be in Athens; Often repented of your journey. Phi. Oh, 'Tis quite impossible to tell how much I long'd to be at home, how much I long'd To leave the Captain, see you, revel with you, After the good old fashion, free, and easy. For there I durst not speak a single word, But what, and when the mighty Captain pleas'd. Par. 'Twas cruel in him thus to tie your tongue: At least, I'll warrant, that you thought it so. Phi. But what's this business, Parmeno? this story That Bacchis has been telling me within? I could not have believ'd that Pamphilus Would in her life-time marry. Par. Marry truly! Phi. Why he is married: is not he? Par. He is. But I'm afraid 'twill prove a crazy match, And will not hold together long. Phi. Heav'n grant it, So it turn out to Bacchis's advantage! But how can I believe this, Parmeno? Tell me. Par. It is not fit it should be told. Enquire no more. Phi. For fear I should divulge it? Now heav'n so prosper me, as I enquire, Not for the sake of telling it again, But to rejoice within myself. Par. All these Fair words, Philotis, sha'n't prevail on me To trust my back to your discretion. Phi. Well; Don't tell me, Parmeno.âAs if you had not Much rather tell this secret, than I hear it! Par. She's in the right: I am a blab, 'tis true. It is my greatest failing.âGive your word, You'll not reveal it, and I'll tell you. Phi. Now You're like yourself again. I give my word. Speak. Par. Listen then. Phi. I'm all ear. Par. Pamphilus Doated on Bacchis still as much as ever, When the old gentleman began to teaze him To marry, in the common cant of fathers; ââThat he was now grown old; and Pamphilus âHis only child; and that he long'd for heirs, âAs props of his old age.â At first my master Withstood his instances, but as his father Became more hot and urgent, Pamphilus Began to waver in his mind, and felt A conflict betwixt love and duty in him. At length, by hammering on marriage still, And daily instances, th'old man prevail'd, And made a match with our next neighbour's daughter. Pamphilus did not take it much to heart, Till just upon the very brink of wedlock: But when he saw the nuptial rites prepar'd, And, without respite, he must marry; then It came so home to him, that even Bacchis, Had she been present, must have pitied him. Whenever he could steal from company, And talk to me alone,ââOh Parmeno, âWhat have I done?â he'd cry.ââI'm lost for ever. âInto what ruin have I plung'd myself! âI cannot bear it, Parmeno. Ah wretch! âI am undone.â Phi. Now all the pow'rs of heav'n Confound you, Laches, for thus teazing him! Par. In short, he marries, and brings home his wife. The first night he ne'er touch'd her; nor the next. Phi. How! he a youth, and she a maidenhead! Tipsy, and never touch her! 'Tis not likely; Nor do I think it can be true. Par. No wonder. For they, that come to you, come all desire: But he was bound to her against his will. Phi. What follow'd upon this? Par. A few days after, Pamphilus, taking me aside, informs me, âThat the maid still remain'd a maid for him; âThat he had hop'd, before he brought her home, âHe might have borne the marriage:âbut resolving âWithin myself, not to retain her long, âI held it neither honesty in Me, âNor of advantage to the maid herself, âThat I should throw her off to scorn:âbut rather âReturn to her friends, as I receiv'd her, âChaste and inviolate.â Phi. A worthy youth, And of great modesty! Par. âTo make this publick âWould not, I think, do well: and to return her âUpon her father's hands, no crime alledg'd, âIs arrogant: but she, I hope, as soon âAs she perceives she cannot live with me, âWill of her own accord depart.â Phi. But tell me; Went he meanwhile to Bacchis? Par. Every day. But she, as is the way you know, perceiving He was another's property, became More cross and mercenary. Phi. Troth, no wonder. Par. Ay, but 'twas that detach'd him chiefly from her. For when he had examin'd well himself, Bacchis, and her at home; and had compar'd Their different manners; seeing that his Bride, After the fashion of a liberal mind, Was decent, modest, patient of affronts, And anxious to conceal the wrongs he did her; Touch'd partly with compassion for his wife, And partly tir'd with t'other's insolence, He by degrees withdrew his heart from Bacchis, Transferring it to her, whose disposition Was so congenial to his own. Meanwhile An old relation of the family Dies in the isle of Imbrus. An island near Thrace. His estate Comes by the law to Them; and our old man Dispatching thither, much against his will, The now-fond Pamphilus, he leaves his wife Here with his mother. The old gentleman Retir'd into the country, This is very well conducted: for supposing the old gentleman to have remained in town, the whole perplexity and intricacy of the fable would be prevented. Donatus. and but seldom Comes up to town. Phi. But what is there in this That can affect the marriage? Par. You shall hear Immediately. At first, for some few days, The women seem'd to live on friendly terms. Till all at once the Bride, forsooth, conceiv'd A wonderful disgust to Sostrata: The explanation of things is very artfully reserved to its proper place; for, in truth, Parmeno is deceived, and Philumena did not withdraw herself from any real disgust to her step-mother, but pretends a pique through shame. Donatus. And yet there was no open breach between them, And no complaints on either side. Phi. What then? Par. If Sostrata, for conversation-sake, Went to the Bride, she instantly withdrew, Shunning her company. At length, not able To bear it any longer, she pretends Her mother had sent for her to assist At some home-sacrifice. Away she went. After a few days absence, Sostrata Sent for her back. They made some lame excuse, I know not what. She sends again. No lady. Then after several messages, at last They say the gentlewoman's sick. My mistress Goes on a visit to her: not let in. Th'old gentleman, inform'd of all this, came On this occasion yesterday to town; And waited on the father of the Bride. What past between them, I as yet can't tell; And yet I long to know the end of this. âThere's the whole business. Now I'll on my way. Phi. And I: for there's a stranger here, with whom I have an assignation. Here Philotis assigns a reason for her never appearing in the rest of the play. Donatus. It were to be wished, for the sake of the credit of our author's acknowledged art in the Drama, that Philotis had assigned as good a reason for her appearing at all. Eugraphius justly says, Ea igitur meretrix, quÃ¦ hic est, longe a fabulÃ¢ est constituta.ââThe courtezan in this scene is a character quite foreign to the fable.â Donatus also says much the same thing in his preface, and in his first note on this comedy; but adds, âthat Terence chose this method, rather than to relate the argument by means of a Prologue, or to introduce a God speaking from a machine.â I will venture to say that the Poet might have taken a much shorter and easier method than either; I mean, to have begun the play with the very scene, which now opens the second Act. Parmeno's narration must be allowed to be beautiful; but to introduce two characters entirely foreign to the play, merely to hear this story, is almost as inartificial, as relating it directly to the audience: but what is still worse, when the tale is all told, the information we receive from it is idle and impertinent, and only serves to forestal incidents, and throw a coldness on the succeeding scenes; for there is not a single circumstance in Parmeno's narration but what unfolds itself in the course of the play; and whoever begins this Comedy at the second act, will take in the whole story as completely, as by beginning at the first.â I may venture therefore to pronounce this act to be redundant, and to assign it as one of the causes of the general complaint of the want of vivacity in the fable of this comedy. A whole act consumed in narration is not artificial; but when the narration is useless and superfluous, it becomes still more inexcusable. Par. Speed the plough! Phi. Parmeno, fare you well! Par. Farewell, Philotis! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. LACHES, SOSTRATA. Donatus remarks that this scene opens the intention of Terence to oppose the generally-received opinion, and to draw the character of a good Step-Mother. It would therefore, as has been already observed, have been a very proper scene to begin the play, as it carries us immediately into the midst of things; and we cannot fail to be interested where we see the persons acting so deeply interested themselves. We gather from it just so much of the story, as is necessary for our information at first setting out: We are told of the abrupt departure of Philumena, and are witnesses of the confusion in the two families of Laches and Phidippus. The absence of Laches, which had been in great measure the occasion of this misunderstanding, is also very artfully mentioned in the altercation between him and Sostrata.âThe character of Laches is very naturally drawn. He has a good heart, and a testy disposition; and the poor old gentleman is kept in such constant perplexity, that he has perpetual occasion to exert both those qualities. Lach. Oh heav'n and earth, what animals are women! What a conspiracy between them all, To do or not do, love or hate alike! Not one but has the sex so strong in her, She differs nothing from the rest. Step-mothers All hate their step-daughters: and every wife Studies alike to contradict her husband, The same perverseness running through them all. Each seems train'd up in the same school of mischief: And of that school, if any such there be, My wife, I think is school-mistress. Sostra. Ah me! Who know not why I am accus'd. Lach. Not know? Sostra. No, as I hope for mercy! as I hope We may live long together! Lach. Heav'n forbid! Sostra. Hereafter, Laches, you'll be sensible How wrongfully you have accus'd me. Lach. I?â Accuse you wrongfully?âIs't possible To speak too hardly of your late behaviour? Disgracing me, yourself, and family; Laying up sorrow for your absent son; Converting into foes his new-made friends, Who thought him worthy of their child in marriage. You've been our bane, and by your shrewishness Brew'd this disturbance. Sostra. I? Lach. You, woman, you: Who take me for a stone, and not a man. Think ye, because I'm mostly in the country, I'm ignorant of your proceedings here? No, no; I know much better what's done here, Than where I'm chiefly resident. Because Upon my family at home, depends My character abroad. I knew long since Philumena's disgust to you;âno wonder! Nay, 'twere a wonder, had it not been so. Yet I imagin'd not her hate so strong, 'Twould vent itself upon the family: Which had I dream'd of, she should have remain'd, And you pack'd off.âConsider, Sostrata, How little cause you had to vex me thus. In complaisance to you, and husbanding My fortune, I retir'd into the country; Scraping, and labouring beyond the bounds Of reason, or my age, that my estate Might furnish means for your expence and pleasure. âWas it not then your duty in return To see that nothing happen'd here to vex me? Sostra. 'Twas not my doing, nor my fault indeed. Lach. 'Twas your fault, Sostrata; your fault alone. You was sole mistress here; and in your care The house, tho' I had freed you of all other cares. A woman, an old woman too, and quarrel With a green girl! oh shame upon't!âYou'll say That 'twas her fault. Sostra. Not I indeed, my Laches. Lach. Fore heav'n, I'm glad on't! on my son's account. For as for You, I'm well enough assur'd, No fault can make you worse. Sostra. But prithee, husband, How can you tell that her aversion to me Is not a mere pretence, that she may stay The longer with her mother? Lach. No such thing. Was not your visit yesterday a proof, From their denial to admit you to her? Sostra. They said she was so sick she could not see me. Lach. Sick of your humours; nothing else, I fancy. And well she might: for there's not one of you But want your sons to take a wife: and that's No sooner over, but the very woman, Which by your instigation they have married, They, by your instigation, put away. SCENE II. Enter PHIDIPPUS. Phid. to Phil. within.] Although, Philumena, I know my pow'r To force you to comply with my commands, Yet yielding to paternal tenderness, I e'en give way, nor cross your humour. Lach. See, Phidippus in good time! I'll learn from him The cause of this.â[going up to him.] Phidippus, This expostulation of Laches with Phidippus is a most faithful and elegant copy of nature. His peace of mind being disturbed by the disorders he finds in his family, his ill-humour, like that of most married men, breaks out first upon his wife. But as family-scenes, whether sweet or bitter, are seldom agreeable to a third person, the presence of Phidippus immediately puts an end to their dialogue. But the circumstance which I most admire is, that although Laches had just before thrown the whole blame on Sostrata, he no sooner sees Phidippus than he endeavours to exculpate his own family, and to insinuate that the whole fault lies on that of his neighbour. tho' I own Myself indulgent to my family, Yet my complacency and easiness Runs not to that extreme, that my good-nature Corrupts their morals. Would you act like me, 'Twould be of service to both families. But you I see are wholly in their pow'r. Phid. See there! Heia vero! These words, seemingly so easy, have yet puzzled Commentators. Donatus makes them an adverb of interruption. Madam Dacier interprets them as addressed by Phidippus to his daughter, in reference to their conversation within, signifying, âDid not I tell you they would âbe offended at your absence?â For my part I take it to be an emotion of surprize mixed with discontent. Phidippus, while he is yet discoursing with his daughter, is suddenly accosted by Laches, and in language too, that he did not much like. Upon which he exclaims, Heia vero! which words seem to answer pretty nearly to our phrase, Look ye there now! a phrase often used on the like occasions. Patrick. Lach. I waited on you yesterday About your daughter: but I went away, No wiser than I came. It is not right, If you would have the alliance last between us, To smother your resentment. If We seem In fault, declare it; that we may refute, Or make amends for our offence: and you Shall carve the satisfaction out yourself. But if her sickness only is the cause Of her remaining in your family, Trust me, Phidippus, but you do me wrong, To doubt her due attendance at my house. For, by the pow'rs of heav'n, I'll not allow That you, altho' her father, wish her better Than I. I love her on my son's account; To whom, I'm well convinc'd, she is as dear As he is to himself: and I can tell Here the Poet very artfully prepares a reason to be assigned by Pamphilus for his pretended discontent at the departure of his wife. Donatus. How deeply 'twill affect him, if he knows this. Wherefore I wish she should come home again, Before my son's return. Phid. My good friend Laches, I know your care, and your benevolence; Nor doubt but all is as you say; and hope That you'll believe I wish for her return, So I could but effect it. Lach. What prevents it? Tell me, Phidippus! does she blame her husband? Phid. Not in the least. For when I urg'd it home, And threaten'd to oblige her to return, She vow'd most solemnly, she could not bear Your house, so long as Pamphilus was absent. âAll have their failings: I am of so soft A nature, I can't thwart my family. Lach. This is extremely artful. The answer of Philumena, as related by Phidippus, contains an ample vindication of Pamphilus. What then can we suppose could make the house so disagreeable to her in his absence, but the behaviour of Sostrata? She declares her innocence; yet appearances are all against her. Supposing this to be the first act of the play, it would be impossible for a Comedy to open in a more interesting manner. Ha, Sostrata! [to Sostrata, apart. Sostra. Wretch that I am! Ah me! [aside. Lach. And her return's impossible? [to Phidippus. Phid. At present. âWould you aught else with me? for I have business That calls me to the Forum. Lach. I'll go with you. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Manet SOSTRATA. Sostra. How unjustly Do husbands stretch their censures to all wives For the offences of a few, whose vices Reflect dishonour on the rest!âFor, heaven So help me, as I'm wholly innocent Of what my husband now accuses me! But 'tis no easy task to clear myself; So fix'd and rooted is the notion in them, That Step-Mothers are all severe.âNot I; For I have ever lov'd Philumena, As my own daughter; nor can I conceive What accident has drawn her hatred on me. My son's return, I hope, will settle all; And, ah, I've too much cause to wish his coming. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter PAMPHILUS and PARMENO. Pam. Never did man experience greater ills, More miseries in love than I.âDistraction! Was it for This I held my life so dear? For This was I so anxious to return? Better, much better were it to have liv'd In any place, than come to this again! To feel, and know myself a wretch!âFor when Mischance befals us, all the interval Between its happening, and our knowledge of it, May be esteem'd clear gain. Par. But as it is, You'll sooner be deliver'd from your troubles. For had you not return'd, the breach between them Had been made wider. But now, Pamphilus, Both will, I doubt not, reverence your presence. You'll know the whole, make up their difference, And reconcile them to each other.âThese Are all mere trifles, which you think so grievous. Pam. Ah, why will you attempt to comfort me? Was ever such a wretch?âBefore I married, My heart, you know, was wedded to another. âBut I'll not dwell upon that misery, Which may be easily conceiv'd: and yet I had not courage to refuse the match My father forc'd upon me.âScarcely wean'd From my old love, my lim'd soul scarcely freed From Bacchis, and devoted to my wife, Than, lo, a new calamity arises, Threatening to tear me from Philumena. For either I shall find my mother faulty, Or else my wife: In either case unhappy. For duty, Parmeno, obliges me To bear with all the failings of a mother: And then I am so bounden to my wife, Who, calm as patience, bore the wrongs I did her, Nor ever murmur'd a complaint.âBut sure 'Twas somewhat very serious, Parmeno, That could occasion such a lasting quarrel. Par. Rather some trifle, if you knew the truth. The greatest quarrels do not always rise From deepest injuries. We often see, That what wou'd never move another's spleen, Renders the cholerick your worst of foes. Observe how lightly children squabble.âWhy? Because they're govern'd by a feeble mind. Women, like children, too are impotent, And weak of soul. A single word, perhaps, Has kindled all this enmity between them. Pam. It was the custom of those times, for the husband returning from abroad to send a messenger before, to give his wife notice of his arrival. Dacier.Go, Parmeno, and let them know I'm come. [noise within. Par. Ha! what's all this? Pam. Hush! Par. I perceive a bustle, And running to and fro.âCome this way, Sir! âTo the door!ânearer still!âThere, there, d'ye hear? [noise continues. Pam. Peace; hush! [shriek within] Oh Jupiter, I heard a shriek! Par. You talk yourself, and bid me hold my tongue. Myrrhina, within.] Hush, my dear child, for heaven's sake! Pam. It seem'd The voice of my wife's mother. I am ruin'd! Par. How so? Pam. Undone! Par. And why? Pam. Ah, Parmeno, They hide some terrible misfortune from me! Par. They said, your wife Philumena was ill: Whether 'tis that, I cannot tell. Pam. Death, sirrah! Why did you not inform me that before? Par. Because I could not tell you all at once. Pam. What's her disorder? Par. I don't know. Pam. But tell me. Has she had no physician? Par. I don't know. Pam. But why do I delay to enter strait, That I may learn the truth, be what it will? âOh my Philumena, in what condition Shall I now find thee?âIf there's danger of thee, My life's in danger too. [Exit. SCENE II. PARMENO alone. It were not good That I should follow him into the house: For all our family are odious to them. The Poet very artfully devises a reason to prevent not only Parmeno, but Sostrata also from entering the house. Donatus. That's plain from their denying Sostrata Admittance yesterday.âAnd if by chance Her illness should increase, (which heav'n forbid, For my poor master's sake!) they'll cry directly, âSostrata's servant came into the house:â Swear,ââthat I brought the plague along with me, âPut all their lives in danger, and encreas'd âPhilumena's distemper.ââBy which means, My mistress will be blam'd, and I be beaten. SCENE III. Enter SOSTRATA. Sostra. Alas, I hear a dreadful noise within. Philumena, I fear, grows worse and worse: Which Ãsculapius, and thou, Health, forbid! She invokes the Goddess of Health together with Ãsculapius, because in Greece their statues were always placed near each other, so that to offer up prayers to the one and not to the other, would have been held the highest indignity to the power neglected.âLucian in his Hippias says, ??? ??????? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ??? ??????? ????????, ? ??? ??????, ??? ?????????. It contains two white marble statues of very ancient workmanship, the one of the Goddess of Health, the other of Ãsculapius. Dacier. But now I'll visit her. [goes towards the house. Par. Ho, Sostrata! Sostra. Who's there? Par. You'll be shut out a second time. Sostra. Ha, Parmeno, are you there?âWretched woman! What shall I do?âNot visit my son's wife, When she lies sick at next door? Par. Do not go; No, nor send any body else; for they, That love the folks, to whom themselves are odious, I think are guilty of a double folly: Their labour proves but idle to themselves, And troublesome to those for whom 'tis meant. Besides, your son, the moment he arriv'd, Went in to visit her. Sostra. How, Parmeno! Is Pamphilus arriv'd? Par. He is. Sostra. Thank heav'n! Oh, how my comfort is reviv'd by that! Par. And therefore I ne'er went into the house. For if Philumena's complaints abate, She'll tell him, face to face, the whole affair, And what has past between you to create This difference.âBut here he comesâhow sad! SCENE IV. Enter PAMPHILUS. Sostra. My dear boy, Pamphilus! Pam. My mother, save you! [disordered. Sostra. I'm glad to see you safe return'd.âHow does Your wife? Pam. A little better. Sostra. Grant it, heav'n! âBut why d'ye weep, and why are you so sad? Pam. Nothing, good mother. Sostra. What was all that bustle? Tell me, did pain attack her suddenly? Pam. It did. Sostra. And what is her complaint? Pam. A fever. Sostra. What! a quotidian? Pam. So they say.âBut in, The behaviour of Pamphilus in this scene is most faithfully copied from nature. Being shocked with the discovery he has made, he leaves the house in great anguish, which, though he wishes to dissemble, he is unable to conceal. He cannot receive his mother as he ought, or give an answer of above two words: and finding himself unfit for conversation or company, he finds means to remove Sostrata and Parmeno as soon as possible. When any unexpected grief takes hold of us, witnesses lay a constraint on our behaviour, and we are apt to wish to be alone in order to deliver ourselves up entirely to the natural emotions of the mind. There is a very superior instance of the like beauty in Othello, in the scene where the Moor is worked up to jealousy by Iago. He first testifies his uneasiness by half-words and short speeches; but soon finding it impossible to smother his disorder much longer, he orders Iago to leave him; upon which he immediately bursts into an agony of passion. Good mother, and I'll follow. Sostra. Be it so. [Exit. Pam. Do you run, Parmeno, to meet the servants, And give your help in bringing home the baggage. Par. As if they did not know the road! Pam. Away! [Exit Parmeno. SCENE V. PAMPHILUS alone. Which way shall I begin the wretched tale Of my misfortunes, which have fall'n upon me Thus unexpectedly? which even now These very eyes have seen, these ears have heard? And which, discover'd, drove me out o'doors, Cover'd with deep confusion?âFor but now As I rush'd in, all anxious for my wife, And thinking to have found her visited, Alas, with a far different complaint; Soon as her women saw me, at first sight Struck and o'erjoy'd, they all exclaim'd, âHe's come!â And then as soon each countenance was chang'd, That chance had brought me so unseasonably. Meanwhile one of them ran before, to speak Of my arrival. I, who long'd to see her, Directly follow'd; and no sooner enter'd, Than her disorder was, alas, too plain: For neither had they leisure to disguise it, Nor could she silence the loud cries of travail. Soon as I saw it, âOh shame, shame!â I cried, And rush'd away in tears and agony, O'erwhelm'd with horror at a stroke so grievous. The mother follows me, and at the threshold Falls on her knees before me all in tears. This touch'd me to the soul. And certainly 'Tis in the very nature of our minds, To rise and fall according to our fortunes. Thus she address'd me.ââOh, my Pamphilus, âThe cause of her removal from your house, âYou've now discover'd. To my virgin-daughter âSome unknown villain offer'd violence; âAnd she fled hither to conceal her labour âFrom you, and from your family.ââAlas! When I but call her earnest prayers to mind, I cannot chuse but weep.ââWhatever chance,â Continued she, âwhatever accident, âBrought you to-day thus suddenly upon us, âBy that we both conjure youâif in justice, âAnd equity we mayâto keep in silence, âAnd cover her distress.âOh, Pamphilus, âIf e'er you witness'd her affection for you, âBy that affection she implores you now, âNot to refuse us!âfor recalling her, âDo as your own discretion shall direct. âThat she's in labour now, or has conceiv'd âBy any other person, is a secret âKnown but to you alone. For I've been told, âThe two first months you had no commerce with her. â There are many doubts concerning the interpretation of this line in the originalâ Tum postquam ad te venit, mensis agitur hic jam septimusâNot being able to adjust this dispute, I have rendered the line by a translation equally equivocal. Some imagine that it means the seventh month from their marriage; and others explain it to be the seventh month from the time that Pamphilus had knowledge of his wife. The words Postquam ad te venit seem to countenance the former interpretation, but what Phidippus says in the next act rather favours the latter. It is necessary to the understanding the fable of this Comedy, that the English Reader should know that the GrÃ¦cians had a power of putting away their wives on refunding the portion. There are several circumstances in the plot of this play rather irreconcilable to modern ideas of delicacy; but as they have in them no moral turpitude, they gave no offence to the Antients. There are no less than three of the six plays of Terence, in which we have a lady in the straw, and in two we absolutely hear her cry out. The Moderns on the contrary have chosen, as subjects of ridicule, things which the Antients would have considered with horror. Adultery has been looked upon by Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanburgh, as a very good joke, and an inexhaustible fund of humour and pleasantry; and âour English Writers,â as Addison observes, âare as frequently severe upon that innocent unhappy creature, commonly known by the name of a Cuckold, as the Ancient Comick Writers were upon an Eating Parasite, or a Vain-Glorious Soldier.âAnd it is now the seventh since your union. âYour sentiments on this are evident. âBut now, my Pamphilus, if possible, âI'll call it a miscarriage: no one else âBut will believe, as probable, 'tis your's. âThe child shall be immediately expos'd. âNo inconvenience will arise to You; âWhile thus you shall conceal the injury, â It is rather extraordinary that Myrrhina's account of the injury done to her daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own adventure, which comes out in the fifth act. It is certain that had the Poet let the Audience into that secret in this place, they would have immediately concluded that the wife of Pamphilus, and the lady whom he had ravished, were one and the same person.That my poor girl unworthily sustain'd.â âI promis'd her; and I will keep my word. But to recall her, wou'd be poor indeed: Nor will I do it, tho' I love her still, And former commerce binds me strongly to her. âI can't but weep, to think how sad and lonely My future life will be.âOh fickle fortune! How transient are thy smiles!âBut I've been school'd To patience by my former hapless passion, Which I subdued by reason: and I'll try By reason to subdue this too.âBut yonder Comes Parmeno, I see, with th'other slaves! He must by no means now be present, since To him alone I formerly reveal'd, I cannot help thinking this circumstance a more than ordinary oversight in so correct a writer as Terence. By entrusting the inquisitive and babbling Parmeno with this secret, he certainly appears to acquaint him with more of the real truth, than it was even his own intention to have him supposed to know. In the last scene of the play Pamphilus conceals from him the discovery concerning Philumena; but that she had retired home, merely for the purpose of lying-in, is a fact which it would not be in his power to conceal. In regard to Laches, Phidippus, and Sostrata, this fact indeed is of no consequence: but Parmeno, who had been entrusted with the secret of his master's abstinence, must either conclude the child to be no son of Pamphilus, and consider his master as a contented cuckold, or guess at the real state of the case. Either way, the intention of the Poet is defeated; and what is still worse than even Parmeno's being acquainted with it himself, we know that he had communicated it to a couple of courtezans; so that this mystery is indeed likely to be what the French call le secret de la Comedie, though not in the sense that Terence himself proposed. That I abstain'd from her when first we married: And if he hears her frequent cries, I fear, That he'll discover her to be in labour. I must dispatch him on some idle errand, Until Philumena's deliver'd. It is observed by the Rev. Mr. Joseph Warton in his judicious critical papers in the Adventurer, that âTerence super-abounds in soliloquies; and that nothing can be more inartificial, or improper, than the manner in which he hath introduced them:â and we may add to this observation, that there is no play of Terence, in which he has so much transgressed that way, as in the Step-Mother. The present long soliloquy is a most flagrant instance of want of art and propriety. There are in it many affecting touches, and it informs us, at a proper period, of a very important part of the fable; though Mons. Diderot thinks that the return of Pamphilus would have been infinitely more interesting, if this discovery had been made before. The same ingenious French Writer lays it down as a rule without exception, that âa soliloquy is an interval of repose in the action, and of agitation in the character.â This rule, I believe, ought to be unexceptionably followed in writing soliloquies: but the fact is directly opposite in the soliloquy now before us. The plot proceeds; but the action is carried on by the worst method possible, that of converting one of the personages into a kind of chorus, interpreting between the Poet and Audience, like Hamlet to Ophelia. The agitation of Pamphilus also is very different from that of Othello, referred to in a former note. It does not consist, as it ought in nature to have done, merely of deliberation and passion; but he enters into a minute detail, and repeats methodically every circumstance supposed to have past within. How much more dramatick would it have been to have had his bitter reflections interrupted by the intervention of Myrrhina; which would have given the Poet an opportunity of throwing that narrative part of the soliloquy into an affecting scene? I cannot help thinking that the tedious length of this ill-timed soliloquy, together with the want of vivacity in the first and last acts, was the chief reason of the low reputation of this piece among the criticks of antiquity. SCENE VI. Enter at a distance PARMENO, SOSIA, and other Slaves with baggage. Par. to Sosia.] Ay? And had you such a wretched voyage, say you? Sosia. O Parmeno, words can't express how wretched A sea-life is. Par. Indeed? Sosia. Oh happy Parmeno! You little know the dangers you've escap'd, Who've never been at sea.âFor not to dwell On other hardships, only think of this! I was on ship-board thirty days or more, In constant fear of sinking all the while, The winds so contrary, such stormy weather! Par. Dreadful! Sosia. I found it so, I promise you. In short, were I assur'd I must return, 'Fore heaven, Parmeno, I'd run away Rather than go on board a ship again. Par. You have been apt enough to think of that On slighter reasons, Sosia, before now. âBut yonder's my young master Pamphilus Standing before that door.âGo in! I'll to him, And see if he has any business for me. [Exeunt Sosia, and the rest of the Slaves with the baggage. Master, are you here still? [to Pamphilus. Pam. Oh Parmeno! I waited for you. Par. What's your pleasure, Sir? Pam. Run to the Citadel. This is no doubt to be understood, as Madam Dacier supposes, of the Fort, or Citadel, that defended the PirÃ¦us. It was at a considerable distance from the city, and therefore better suited to the design of Pamphilus, which was to keep Parmeno for some time at a distance. Patrick. Par. Who? Pam. You. Par. The Citadel! For what? Pam. Find out one Callidemides, My landlord of Mycone, who came over In the same ship with me. Par. A plague upon it! Would not one swear that he had made a vow This is a facetious allusion to the custom among the ancients, of persons engaged in a dangerous voyage vowing to perform particular acts, in case they came home in safety. Donatus. To break my wind, if he came home in safety, With running on his errands? Pam. Away, Sirrah! Par. What message? Must I only find him out? Pam. Yes; tell him, that it is not in my power To meet him there to-day, as I appointed; That he mayn't wait for me in vain.âHence; fly! Par. But I don't know him, if I see him, Sir. Pam. impatiently.] Well; I'll describe him so, you cannot miss him. âA large, red, frizzle-pated, gross, blear-eyed, Ill-looking fellow. Par. Plague on him, say I! âWhat if he should not come, Sir, must I wait Till evening for him? Pam. Wait.âBe quick! Par. Be quick? I can't be quick,âI'm so much tir'd. [Exit. SCENE VII. PAMPHILUS alone. He's gone. What shall I do? Alas, I scarcely know How to conceal, as Myrrhina desir'd, Her daughter's labour. Yet I pity her; And what I can, I am resolv'd to do, Consistent with my duty: for my parents This reflection seems to be rather improper in this place: for the discovery of Philumena's labour betrayed to Pamphilus the real motive of her departure: after which discovery his anxiety proceeds entirely from the supposed injury offered him, and his filial piety is from that period made use of merely as a pretence. Must be obey'd before my love.âBut see! My father and Phidippus come this way. How I shall act, heav'n knows. SCENE VIII. Enter at a distance LACHES and PHIDIPPUS. Lach. Did not you say She only waited my son's coming? Phid. Ay. Lach. They say that he's arriv'd. Let her return then! Pam. behind.] What reason I shall frame to give my father, For not recalling her, I cannot tell. Lach. overhearing.] Whose voice was that? Pam. to himself.] And yet I am resolv'd To stand to my first purpose. Lach. seeing Pamphilus.] He himself, Whom I was speaking of! Pam. going up.] My father, save you! Lach. Save you, my son! Phid. Pamphilus, welcome home! I'm glad to see you safe, and in good health. Pam. I do believe it. Lach. Are you just now come? Pam. Just now, Sir. Lach. Well; and tell me, Pamphilus, What has our kisman Phania left us? Pam. Ah, Sir, He, his whole life-time, was a man of pleasure, And such men seldom much enrich their heirs. Yet he has left at least this praise behind him, âWhile he liv'd, he liv'd well.â Lach. And have you brought Tum tu igitur nihil attulisti hac plus unÃ¢ sententiÃ¢. This is taken notice of by Donatus as a particular happy stroke of character: and indeed the idea of a covetous old man gaping for a fat legacy, and having his mouth stopped with a moral precept, is truly comick. See Hurd's Horace, vol. 1. p. 272. Nothing home with you but this single sentence? Pam. What he has left, tho' small, is of advantage. Lach. Advantage? No, it is a disadvantage: For I could wish he was alive and well. Phid. That you may safely; for your wishing for't Will never bring the man to life again: Yet I know well enough which you'd like best. [aside. Lach. to Pam.] Phidippus order'd that Philumena Should be sent over to him yesterday. âSay that you order'd it. [aside to Phidippus, thrusting him. Phid. aside to Laches.] Don't thrust me so.â I did. [aloud. Lach. But now he'll send her home again. Phid. I will. Pam. Nay, nay, I know the whole affair. Since my arrival, I have heard it all. Lach. Now, plague upon these envious tale-bearers, Who are so glad to fetch and carry news! Pam. to Phid.] That I've endeavour'd to deserve no blame From any of the family, I'm conscious. Were it my inclination to relate, How true I've been, how kind, and gentle tow'rds her, I well might do it: But I rather chuse, You should collect it from herself. For when She, altho' now there's enmity between us, Bespeaks me fair, you will the sooner credit My disposition tow'rds her. And I call The Gods to witness, that this separation Has not arisen from my fault. But since She thinks it is beneath her to comply With Sostrata, and bear my mother's temper; And since no other means are to be found Of reconciliation, I, Phidippus, Must leave my mother or Philumena. Duty then calls me to regard my mother. Lach. My Pamphilus, I cannot be displeas'd, That you prefer to all the world a parent. But take heed, your resentment don't transport you Beyond the bounds of reason, Pamphilus. Pam. Ah, what resentment can I bear to her, Who ne'er did any thing I'd wish undone, But has so often deserv'd well of me? I love her, own her worth, and languish for her; For I have known her tenderness of soul: And heaven grant, that with some other husband She find that happiness she mist in me; From whom the strong hand of necessity Divorces her for ever! Phid. That event 'Tis in your pow'r to hinder. Lach. If you're wise, Take your wife home again! Pam. I cannot, father. I must not slack my duty to my mother. [going. Lach. Where are you going? [Exit Pamphilus. SCENE IX. Manent LACHES, and PHIDIPPUS. Phid. How perverse is this! [angrily. Lach. Did not I say he'd take it ill, Phidippus, And therefore begg'd you to send back your daughter? Phid. 'Fore heaven I did not think him such a churl. What! does he fancy I'll go cringing to him? No;âif he'll take his wife, he may:âif not, Let him refund her portion;âthere's an end! Lach. See there now! you're as fractious as himself. Phid. You're come back obstinate and proud enough In conscience, Pamphilus! [angrily. Lach. This anger will subside, Tho' he has had some cause to be disturb'd. Phid. Because you've had a little money left you, Your minds are so exalted! Lach. What! d'ye quarrel With Me too? Phid. Let him take to-day to think on't, And send me word if he will have her home, Or not: that if she don't remain his wife, She may be given to another. [Exit hastily. SCENE X. LACHES alone. Stay! Hear me! one word, Phidippus! Stay!âHe's gone. âWhat is't to me? [angrily.] E'en let them settle it Among themselves; since nor my son, nor He Take my advice, nor mind one word I say. âThis quarrel shall go round, I promise them: I'll to my wife, the author of this mischief, And vent my spleen and anger upon Her. There are few scenes of comedy more truly humourous than the situation and behaviour of the two old gentlemen at the conclusion of this act. The natural, but uncommon conduct of Pamphilus; its effect on Phidippus; his treatment of Laches and abrupt departure; and then again the emotions of Laches on the usage he had experienced from his son and his neighbour, are all very pleasant, and must produce an admirable effect in the representation. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter MYRRHINA hastily. Myrr. What shall I do!âConfusion!âwhich way turn? Alas, what answer shall I make my husband? For I dare say he heard the infant's cries, He ran so hastily, without a word, Into my daughter's chamber. If he finds That she has been deliver'd, what excuse To make, for having thus conceal'd her labour, I can't devise.âBut our door creaks!â'Tis He. I am undone. SCENE II. Enter PHIDIPPUS. Phid. Soon as my wife perceiv'd Uxor ubi me ad filiam ire sensit, se duxit foras. Madam Dacier joins this scene to the third act, and assigns this verse as her reason for it. I have chosen rather to follow the old division, which seems to me to be the right. This scene brings on a new part of the plot; which occupies the rest of this fourth act. The continuity of the scenes being broken at the departure of Myrrhina proves nothing, or too much: for Terence often takes that liberty in the middle of an act, and the scene is certainly left vacant by Laches. Besides, Myrrhina does not, as Madam Dacier asserts, leave the house immediately on the entrance of Phidippus, in order to avoid him; but is frightened out of doors by his running to Philumena's chamber on hearing the cries of the Child. This, it is most natural to suppose, happened some time after he had returned home, and all these circumstances are with much greater propriety made to fill the interval between the two acts, than huddled into the compass of six lines. Terence, indeed, sometimes runs into that very absurdity; but I think we need not industriously force him out of his way on purpose to make him guilty of it. That I was going to my daughter's chamber, She stole directly out o'doors.âBut there She stands.âWhy, how now, Myrrhina? Holo, I say! [She affects not to see him. Myrr. D'ye call me, husband? Phid. Husband! Am I your husband? am I ev'n a man? For had you thought me to be either, Woman, You would not dare to play upon me thus. Myrr. How! Phid. How?âMy daughter has been brought to bed. âHa! are you dumb?âby whom? Myrr. Is that a question For you, who are her father, to demand? Alas, by whom d'ye think, unless her husband? Phid. So I believe: nor is it for a father To suppose otherwise: But yet I wonder, That you have thus conceal'd her labour from us: Especially as she has been deliver'd At her full time, and all is as it shou'd be. What! Is there such perverseness in your nature, As rather to desire the infant's death, Than that his birth shou'd knit the bond of friendship Closer betwixt us; rather than my daughter, Against your liking, shou'd remain the wife Of Pamphilus?âI thought all this Had been Their fault, while You're alone to blame. Myrr. How wretched am I! Phid. Would to heav'n you were! âBut now I recollect your conversation When first we made this match, you then declar'd You'd not endure she should remain the wife Of Pamphilus, who follow'd mistresses, And pass'd the nights abroad. Myrr. I had much rather He should think any reason, than the true one. [aside. Phid. I knew he kept a mistress; knew it long Ere you did, Myrrhina; but I could never Think that offence so grievous in a youth, Seeing 'tis natural to them all: and soon The time shall come, when he'll stand self-reprov'd. But you, perverse and wilful as at first, Could take no rest, till you had brought away Your daughter, and annull'd the match, I made: There's not a circumstance, but loudly speaks Your evil disposition to the marriage. Myrr. D'ye think me then so obstinate, that I, Who am her mother, shou'd betray this spirit, Granting the match were of advantage to us? Phid. Is it for you then to foresee, or judge What's of advantage to us? You perhaps Have heard from some officious busy-body, That they have seen him going to his mistress, Or coming from her house: And what of that, So it were done discreetly, and but seldom? Were it not better that we should dissemble Our knowledge of it, than pry into things, Which to appear to know wou'd make him hate us? For could he tear her from his heart at once, To whom he'd been so many years attach'd, I should not think he were a man, or likely To prove a constant husband to my daughter. Myrr. No more of Pamphilus, or my offence; Since you will have it so!âGo, find him out; Confer with him alone, and fairly ask him, Will he, or no, take back Philumena? If he avows his inclination to't, Restore her; but if he refuses it, Allow, I've ta'en good counsel for my child. Phid. Grant, he shou'd prove repugnant to the match, Grant, you perceiv'd this in him, Myrrhina; Was not I present? had not I a right To be consulted in't?âIt makes me mad, That you should dare to act without my order: And I forbid you to remove the Child Out of this house.âBut what a fool am I, Enjoining her obedience to my orders! I'll in, and charge the servants, not to suffer The infant to be carried forth. [Exit. SCENE III. MYRRHINA alone. No woman more unhappy than myself: For how he'd bear it, did he know the whole, When he has taken such offence at this, Which is of much less consequence, is plain. Nor by what means to reconcile him to it, Can I devise. After so many ills, This only misery there yet remain'd, To be oblig'd to educate the child, Ignorant of the father's quality. For he, the cruel spoiler of her honour, Taking advantage of the night and darkness, My daughter was not able to discern His person; nor to force a token from him, Whereby he might be afterwards discover'd: But he, at his departure, pluck'd by force A Ring from off her finger.â This is a preparation for the Catastrophe; for the Ring produces the discovery. Donatus. This preparation being made by a soliloquy, which tells the circumstance directly to the audience, is not so artful as might be expected from Terence. I fear too, That Pamphilus will not contain himself, Nor longer keep our secret, when he finds Another's child acknowledg'd for his own. [Exit. SCENE IV. SOSTRATA, PAMPHILUS. Sostra. Dear son, I'm not to learn that you suppose, Tho' you dissemble your suspicions to me, That my ill-humour caus'd your wife's departure. But by my trust in heaven, and hopes in you, I never knowingly did any thing To draw her hatred and disgust upon me. I always thought you lov'd me, and to-day You have confirm'd my faith: for even now Your father has been telling me within, How much you held me dearer than your love. Now therefore, on my part, I am resolv'd To equal you in all good offices; That you may know your mother ne'er withholds The just rewards of filial piety: Finding it then both meet for your repose, My Pamphilus, as well as my good name, I have determin'd to retire directly From hence into the country with your father; So shall my presence be no obstacle, Nor any cause remain, but that your wife Return immediately. Pam. What thoughts are these? Shall her perverseness drive you out of town? It shall not be: nor will I draw, good mother, That censure on me, that my obstinacy, Not your good-nature was the cause.âBesides, That you should quit relations, friends, diversions, On my account, I can't allow. Sostra. Alas, Those things have no allurements for me now. While I was young, and 'twas the season for them, I had my share, and I am satisfied. 'Tis now my chief concern to make my age Easy to all, This idea of the long life of a Step-Mother being odious to her family is applied in a very beautiful and uncommon manner by Shakespeare. Now, fair Hippolita, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon: but, oh, methinks how slow This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires, Like to a Step-Dame, or a Dowager, Long withering out a young man's revenue. Midsummer Night's Dream. that no one may regret My lengthen'd life, nor languish for my death. Here, altho' undeservedly, I see Though Sostrata industriously endeavours to stifle her resentment, yet, in spite of herself, some little indignation, arising from a sense of the ill usage she has received, will mix in what she says; which the Poet has purposely thrown into her discourse, in order to paint the manners, and express character. Donatus. My presence odious: I had best retire: So shall I best cut off all discontent, Absolve myself from this unjust suspicion, And humour Them. Permit me then to shun The common scandal thrown upon the sex. Pam. How fortunate in every thing but one, Having so good a mother,âsuch a wife! Sostra. Patience, my Pamphilus! Is't possible You can't endure one inconvenience in her? If in all else, as I believe, you like her, Dear son, be rul'd by me, and take her home! Pam. Wretch that I am! Sostra. And I am wretched too: For this grieves me, my son, no less than you. SCENE V. Enter LACHES. Lach. I have been standing at a distance, wife, And overheard your conversation with him. You have done wisely to subdue your temper, And freely to comply with what, perhaps, Hereafter must be done. Sostra. And let it be! Fors fuat pol! Madam Dacier refines prodigiously on these three words, and supposing great difficulty in them, explains them by a very long periphrasis. Donatus seems to consider them as mere words of assent, agreeable to the mild character of Sostrata; and if I might venture to correct a French translation, I would say that Madam Dacier might have rendered them more properly by the common expression of A la bonne heure! Lach. Now then retire with me into the country: There I shall bear with You, and You with Me. Sostra. I hope we shall. Lach. Go in then, and pack up The necessaries you would carry with you. Away! Sostra. I shall obey your orders. [Exit. Pam. Father! Lach. Well, Pamphilus? Pam. My mother leave the town? By no means. Lach. Why? Pam. Because I'm yet uncertain What I shall do about my wife. Lach. How's that? What would you do, but take her home again? Pam. 'Tis what I wish for, and can scarce forbear it. But I'll not alter what I first design'd. What's best I'll follow: and I'm well convinc'd That there's no other way to make them friends, But that I should not take her home again. Lach. You don't know that: but 'tis of no importance Whether they're friends or not, when Sostrata Is gone into the country. We old folks Are odious to the young. We'd best retire. In short we're grown a by-word, Pamphilus, â Odiosa hÃ¦c est Ã¦tas adolescentulis. E medio Ã¦quom excedere est. Postremo jam nos fabulÃ¦ sumus, Pamphile, Senex atque Anus. There is nothing, I suppose, in these words, which provokes a smile. Yet the humour is strong. In his solicitude to promote his son's satisfaction, he lets fall a sentiment truly characteristick, and which old men usually take great pains to conceal; I mean the acknowledgment of that suspicious fear of contempt, which is natural to old age. So true a picture of life in the representation of this weakness, might, in other circumstances, have created some pleasantry; but the occasion, which forced it from him, discovering, at the same time, the amiable disposition of the speaker, covers the ridicule of it, or more properly converts it into an object of esteem. Hurd's Dissertation on the several Provinces of the Drama. I cannot help thinking that the latter part of this ingenious remark is rather too refined. If the characteristick humour of the passage is strong, the ridicule seems rather intended to be heightened by the comick turn of expression. The complections of men are so different, and the muscles of some are so much more easily relaxed into a smile than those of others, that it is difficult to pronounce exactly in what degree such a sober piece of pleasantry would act upon them. But there are many instances of passages of true humour, which do not immediately raise a laugh, or even provoke a smile: and it is sufficient if they are conceived in the same vein of pleasantry, that runs though the rest of the work. The stroke of character before us seems to me to be just in the same stile with that which this critick takes notice of, in the third act, and of which he says, that âit is an observation drawn naturally and forcibly from Laches;âand this too without design; which is important, and shews the distinction of what, in the more restrained sense of the word, we call humour, from other modes of pleasantry.âThe old man and old woman.ââBut I see Phidippus coming in good time. Let's meet him! SCENE VI. Enter PHIDIPPUS. Phid. to Phil. within.] I'm angry with youâ'fore heaven, very angry, Philumena!âYou've acted shamefully. Though You indeed have some excuse for't, seeing Your mother urg'd you to't; but She has none. Lach. You're come upon us in good time, Phidippus; Just in the time we wanted you. Phid. What now? Pam. What answer shall I give them? Quo pacto hoc aperiam? This is the common reading, which Bentley and Madam Dacier convert to operiam, how shall I hide it? I see no occasion for any alteration. Pamphilus did not mean to divulge the secret; but in his present embarassment he might easily be perplexed how to assign plausible reasons for his way of acting. how explain? [aside. Lach. Inform your daughter, Sostrata will hence Into the country; so Philumena Need not dread coming home again. Phid. Ah, friend! Your wife has never been in fault at all: All this has sprung from my wife Myrrhina. The case is alter'd. She confounds us, Laches. Pam. So that I may not take her home again, Confound affairs who will! [aside. Phid. I, Pamphilus, Would fain, if possible, make this alliance Perpetual between our families. But if you cannot like it, take the Child. According to law, the Male Children always followed the father. Donatus. Pam. He knows of her delivery. Confusion! [aside. Lach. The Child! what Child? Phid. We've got a grandson, Laches. For when my daughter left your house, she was With child, it seems, altho' I never knew it Before this very day. Lach. For heav'n, good news! And I rejoice to hear a child is born, And that your daughter had a safe delivery. But what a woman is your wife, Phidippus? Of what a disposition? to conceal Such an event as this? I can't express How much I think she was to blame. Phid. This pleases me, no more than you, good Laches. Pam. Altho' my mind was in suspence before, My doubts all vanish now. I'll ne'er recall her, Since she brings home with her another's child. [aside. Lach. There is no room for choice now, Pamphilus. Pam. Confusion! [aside. Lach. We've oft wish'd to see the day, When you should have a child, to call you father. That day's now come. The Gods be thank'd! Pam. Undone! [aside. Lach. Recall your wife, and don't oppose my will. Pam. If she had wish'd for children by me, father, Or to remain my wife, I'm very sure She never would have hid this matter from me: But now I see her heart divorc'd from me, And think we never can agree hereafter, Wherefore should I recall her? Lach. A young woman Did as her mother had persuaded her. Is that so wonderful? and do you think To find a woman without any fault? âOr is't because the men are ne'er to blame? [ironically. Phid. Consider with yourselves then, gentlemen, Whether you'll part with her, or call her home. What my wife does, I cannot help, you know. Settle it as you please, you've my consent. But for the child, what shall be done with him? Lach. A pretty question truly! come what may, Send his own bantling home to him of course, That we may educate him. Pam. When his own Quem ipse neglexit pater, ego alam? Donatus on this passage takes notice of a reading, which entirely changes the sense. Quem ipsa neglexit, pater; where we have ipsa for ipse, and Pater is a vocative. âShall I, father, take care of a child, whom the mother herself has abandoned?â But the other reading is certainly the best. It is full of passion, and is strongly descriptive of the situation of Pamphilus. There is indeed an objection that may be offered, from a supposition, that this were betraying Philumena. But we are to imagine it a start of passion, and that Laches, totally ignorant of that secret, catches at the last words Ego alam? âI educate him?â which the actor might deliver with greater energy than the preceding. Patrick. Father abandons him, I educate him? Lach. What said you? how! not educate him, say you? Shall we expose him rather, Pamphilus? What madness is all this?âMy breath, and blood! I can contain no longer. You oblige me To speak, against my will, before Phidippus: Think you I'm ignorant whence flow those tears? Or why you're thus disorder'd and distress'd? First, when you gave as a pretence, you could not Recall your wife in reverence to your mother, She promis'd to retire into the country. But now, since that excuse is taken from you, You've made her private lying-in another. You are mistaken if you think me blind To your intentions.âThat you might at last Bring home your stray affections to your wife, How long a time to wean you from your mistress Did I allow? your wild expence upon her How patiently I bore? I press'd, intreated, That you would take a wife. 'Twas time, I said. At my repeated instances you married, And, as in duty bound to do, complied: But now your heart is gone abroad again After your mistress, whom to gratify, You throw this wanton insult on your wife. For I can plainly see you are relaps'd Into your former life again. Pam. Me? Lach. You. And 'tis base in you, to invent false causes Of quarrel with your wife, that you may live In quiet with your mistress, having put This witness from you. This your wife perceiv'd. For was there any other living reason, Wherefore she should depart from you? Phid. He's right: That was the very thing. Pam. I'll take my oath, 'Twas none of those, that you have mention'd. Lach. Ah, Recall your wife: or tell me, why you will not. Pam. 'Tis not convenient now. Lach. Take home the child then. For he at least is not in fault. I'll see About the mother afterwards. Pam. to himself.] Ev'ry way I am a wretch, nor know I what to do: My father has me in the toils, and I, By struggling to get loose, am more entangled. I'll hence, since present I shall profit little. For I believe they'll hardly educate The child against my will; especially Seeing my step-mother will second me. [Exit. SCENE VII. Manent PHIDIPPUS, LACHES. Lach. Going? how's that? and give me no plain answer! âD'ye think he's in his senses?âWellâsend home The child to me, Phidippus. I'll take care on't. Phid. I will.âI cannot wonder that my wife Took this so ill. Women are passionate, And can't away with such affronts as these. This was their quarrel: nay she told me so, Though before Him I did not care to speak on't: Nor did I credit it at first; but now 'Tis evident, and I can plainly see He has no stomach to a wife. Lach. Phidippus, How shall I act? What's your advice? Phid. How act? I think 'twere best to seek this wench, his mistress. Let us expostulate the matter with her, Speak to her roundly, nay, e'en threaten her, If she has aught to do with him hereafter. Lach. I'll follow your advice.âHo, boy! [enter a boy.] run over To Bacchis. Tell her to come forth to me. [Exit boy. âI must beseech you also to continue Your kind assistance to me in this business. Phid. Ah, Laches! I have told you all along, And I repeat it now, that 'tis my wish To render our alliance firm and lasting, If possible, as I have hopes it will be. âBut would you have me present at your conference With Bacchis? Phidippus utters these words with an air of disinclination to be present at this conference; and the characters are well sustained in this instance: for it would not become him to discourse coolly with a courtezan whom he supposed to be the seducer of Pamphilus from his daughter, although he might very properly advise such a conversation, as conducive to the peace of both families. Donatus. Lach. No; go, seek the child a nurse. [Exit Phidippus. SCENE VIII. Enter BACCHIS attended by her Women. Bacc. to herself.] 'Tis not for nothing Laches wants to see me; And, or I'm much deceiv'd, I guess the cause. Lach. to himself.] I must take care my anger don't transport me Beyond the bounds of prudence, which may hinder My gaining my design on her, and urge me To do what I may afterwards repent. I'll to her.â[going up.] Save you, Bacchis! Bacc. Save you, Laches! Lach. Bacchis, I do not doubt but you're surpriz'd That I should send the boy to call you forth. Bacc. Ay, and I'm fearful too, when I reflect Both who and what I am: lest my vocation Should prejudice me in your good opinion. My conduct I can fully justify. Lach. If you speak truth, you're in no danger, woman. For I'm arriv'd at that age, when a trespass Would not be easily forgiven in me. Wherefore I study to proceed with caution, And to do nothing rashly. If you act, And will continue to act honestly, It were ungenerous to do you wrong, And seeing you deserve it not, unjust. Bacc. Truly, this conduct asks my highest thanks; For he who does the wrong, and then asks pardon, Makes but a sorry reparation for it. But what's your pleasure? Lach. You receive the visits Of my son Pamphilusâ Bacc. Ah!â Lach. Let me speak. Before he married I endur'd your love. âStay! I've not finish'd all I have to say.â He is now married. You then, while 'tis time, Seek out another, and more constant friend. For he will not be fond of you for ever, Nor you, good faith, for ever in your bloom. Bacc. Who tells you that I still receive the visits Of Pamphilus? Lach. His step-mother. Bacc. I? Lach. You. And therefore has withdrawn her daughter: therefore Meant secretly to kill the new-born child. Bacc. Did I know any thing, to gain your credit, More sacred than an oath, I'd use it, Laches, In solemn protestation to assure you, That I have had no commerce with your son, Since he was married. Me segregatum habuisse, uxorem ut duxit, a me Pamphilum. How shall we reconcile this solemn protestation of Bacchis to a passage in the first act? Ph. Quid interea! ibatne ad Bacchidem? Par. Cotidie. Phi. But tell me; Went he meanwhile to Bacchis? Par. Every day. Are we to suppose that Bacchis, who behaves so candidly in every other instance, wantonly perjures herself in this? or that the Poet, by a kind of infatuation strangely attending him in this Comedy, flatly contradicts himself? Lach. Good girl! But d'ye know What I would farther have you do? Bacc. Inform me. Lach. Go to the women here, and offer them The same oath. Satisfy their minds, and clear Yourself from all reproach in this. Bacc. I'll do't. Altho' I'm sure no other of my calling Would shew herself before a married woman Upon the same occasion.âBut it hurts me To see your son suspected on false grounds; And that to those, who owe him better thoughts, His conduct should seem light. For he deserves All my best offices. Lach. Your conversation has much wrought upon me, Gain'd my good-will, and alter'd my opinion. For not the women only thought thus of you, But I believ'd it too. Now therefore since I've found you better than my expectation, Prove still the same, and make my friendship sure. If otherwiseâBut I'll contain myself. I'll not Say any thing severe.âBut I advise you, Rather experience what a friend I am, Than what an enemy. Bacc. I'll do my best. SCENE IX. Enter PHIDIPPUS and a Nurse. Phid. to the Nurse.] Nay, you shall want for nothing at my house; I'll give you all that's needful in abundance. But when you've eat and drank your fill yourself, Take care to satisfy the infant too. Lach. I see the father of Philumena Coming this way. He brings the child a nurse. âPhidippus, Bacchis swears most solemnlyâ Phid. Is this she? Lach. Ay. Phid. They never mind the Gods, Nor do I think the Gods mind them. Bacc. Here are My waiting-women: take them, and extort By any kind of torment the truth from them. âOur present business is, I take it, this: That I should win the wife of Pamphilus To return home; which so I but effect, I sha'n't regret the fame of having done What others of my calling would avoid. Terence, by his uncommon art, has attempted many innovations with great success. In this comedy he introduces, contrary to received prejudices, a good Step-Mother, and an honest courtezan; but at the same time he so carefully assigns their motives of action, that by him alone every thing seems reconcilable to truth and nature; for this is just the opposite of what he mentions in another place, as the common privilege of all poets, âto paint good matrons, and wicked courtezans.â Donatus. Lach. Phidippus, we've discover'd that in fact We both suspected our wives wrongfully. Let's now try Her: for if your wife perceives Her own suspicions also are unjust, She'll drop her anger. If my son's offended, Because his wife conceal'd her labour from him, That's but a trifle; he'll be soon appeas'd. âAnd truly I see nothing in this matter, That need occasion a divorce. Phid. Fore heav'n, I wish that all may end well. Lach. Here she is: Examine her; she'll give you satisfaction. Phid. What needs all this to Me? You know my mind Already, Laches: do but make Them easy. Lach. Bacchis, be sure you keep your promise with me. Bacc. Shall I go in then for that purpose? Lach. Ay, Go in; remove their doubts, It is not unlikely that the method of bringing about the discovery by means of Bacchis going into the family, gave Sir Richard Steele the hint of sending Sealand to Indiana's lodgings for the same purpose. When we are professedly imitating one part of an author, we naturally enough make use of other passages in his works; and what inclines me the more to this conjecture, is that Steele makes exactly the same use of the Bracelet, that Terence does of the Ring, though the presence of Isabella rendered it not so necessary. Such an inconsistency might very possibly proceed from imitation. and satisfy them. Bacc. I will; altho' I'm very sure my presence Will be unwelcome to them; for a wife, When parted from her husband, to a mistress Is a sure enemy. Lach. They'll be your friends, When once they know the reason of your coming. Phid. Ay, ay, they'll be your friends, I promise you, When they once learn your errand; for you'll free Them from mistake, Yourself from all suspicion. Bacc. I'm cover'd with confusion. I'm asham'd To see Philumena.â[to her women.] You two, in after me. [Exeunt Phid. Bacc. &amp;c. LACHES alone. This soliloquy seems to be rather idle and unnecessary: but it is but justice to observe of this act in general, that the perplexity of the fable is very artfully increased, and that the incidents tending to the catastrophe are well contrived and most naturally introduced. What is there that could please me more than This, That Bacchis, without any loss, should gain Favour from Them, and do Me service too? For if she really has withdrawn herself From Pamphilus, it will increase, she knows, Her reputation, interest, and honour; Since by this generous act she will at once Oblige my son, and make us all her friends. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. PARMENO alone. I'faith my master holds my labour cheap, To send me to the Citadel for nothing, Where I have waited the whole day in vain For his Myconian, Callidemides. There was I sitting, gaping like a fool, And running up, if any one appear'd, ââAre you, Sir, a Myconian?âââNo not I.ââ ââBut your name's Callidemides?âââNot it.ââ âAnd have not you a guest here, of the name âOf Pamphilus?ââAll answer'd, No. In short, I don't believe there's such a man. At last I grew asham'd, and so sneak'd off. âBut is't not Bacchis that I see come forth From our new kinsman? What can she do there? SCENE II. Enter BACCHIS. Bacc. Oh Parmeno, I'm glad I met with you. Run quick to Pamphilus. Parmeno is drawn as of a lazy and inquisitive character. Terence therefore humourously contrives to keep him in continual employment and total ignorance. Donatus. Par. On what account? Bacc. Tell him, that I desire he'd come. Par. To you? Bacc. No; to Philumena. Par. Why, what's the matter? Bacc. Nothing to You; so ask no questions. Par. Must I Say nothing else? Bacc. Yes; tell him too, That Myrrhina acknowledges the Ring, Which formerly he gave me, as her daughter's. Par. I understand you. But is that all? Bacc. All. He'll come the moment that you tell him that. What! do you loiter? Par. No, i'faith, not I. I have not had it in my pow'r, I've been So bandied to and fro, sent here and there, Trotting, and running up and down all day. [Exit. SCENE III. BACCHIS alone. The rest of the argument is told in soliloquy. Donatus. So much the worse. What joy have I procur'd to Pamphilus By coming here to-day! what blessings brought him! And from how many sorrows rescued him! His son, by his and their means nearly lost, I've sav'd; a wife, he meant to put away, I have restor'd; and from the strong suspicions Of Laches and Phidippus set him free. âOf all these things the Ring has been the cause. For I remember, near ten months ago, That he came running home to me one evening, Breathless, alone, and much inflam'd with wine, Bringing this Ring. I was alarm'd at it. âPrithee, my dearest Pamphilus, said I, Terence studies brevity: for in the Greek these things are acted, not related. Donatus. This is so curious a piece of information, communicated by Donatus, that I am surprised that no former editors or translators have taken notice of it. If it means, that in the Greek the circumstances of the catastrophe were thrown into action, Terence may indeed have studied brevity, but he has not much consulted the entertainment of his audience. That this is the meaning of this passage in Donatus, I think is plain. The conversation, of which Bacchis here speaks, must have taken place before the opening of the play; so that it can hardly be supposed to have been introduced as a scene in the original Greek: besides, the note of Donatus immediately preceding seems to confirm this interpretation, as well as what he says soon after, conclusit narrationem fabulÃ¦, more suo: ne hÃ¦c in futuro actu expectaremus. âHe has here concluded the story of the fable, after his usual manner: that we may not expect these things to come out in a future act.â âWhence comes all this confusion? whence this Ring? âTell me, my love.ââHe put me off at first: Perceiving this, it made me apprehend Something of serious import, and I urg'd him More earnestly to tell me.âHe confess'd That, as he came along, he had committed A rape upon a virginâwhom he knew notâ And, as she struggled, forc'd from her that Ring: Which Myrrhina now seeing on my finger, Immediately acknowledg'd, and enquir'd, How I came by it. I told all this story: It is not sufficient, oh thou writer of Comedy, to have said in your plan, âI will introduce a young man but weakly attached to a courtezan; he shall quit her; shall marry, and be fond of his wife; the wife shall be amiable, and her husband promise himself a happy life with her: Moreover, he shall lie by her for two months without touching her, and yet she shall prove with child. I must have a good Step-Mother, and a Courtezan of sentiment. I cannot do without a rape; and I will suppose it to be committed in the street by a young man drunk.ââVery well: Courage! Go on; huddle strange circumstances one upon another; I consent to it. Your fable will be wonderful, to be sure. But do not forget, that you must redeem all this marvellous in your plot by a multitude of common incidents that atone for it, and give it the air of probability. Diderot. The above extract from Mons. Diderot's Essay on Dramatick Poetry is a very elegant compliment to the genius of our poet, and the art displayed in the play before us. The outline of the fable is undoubtedly beautiful; but on the whole, I cannot think that outline so well filled as might be expected from the master-hand of Terence. There are many circumstances happily contrived to create an agreeable perplexity, but in other parts of the piece there prevails an uncommon coldness and want of spirit. The same ingenious French Critick has a very fine passage in the Essay above mentioned. âAlthough,â says he, âthe quickness of the movement varies according to the different species of the Drama, yet the action always proceeds. It does not stop even between the acts. 'Tis a mass loosened from the top of a rock: its velocity increases in proportion to its descent; and it bounds from place to place, according to the obstacles which it meets with in its way.ââ According to this comparison, which is, I think, as just as it is beautiful, what shall we say to the first act of this Comedy? Instead of a mass falling from a rock, it seems an unwieldy mass, which can with difficulty be heaved from the ground: or, to change the allusion, the Poet treats his fable, as the Savoyards do a clock-work figure, which they are obliged to wind up, before they can set it in motion.âAnd then of what does the last act consist? All the materials, which should compose it, are exhausted in the interval supposed to pass between that act and the fourth, a fault, which dramatick writers, of inferior genius to Terence, are very apt to fall into. But surely there cannot be an error more fatal to the catastrophe of a piece; nor any fault more fatal to the piece than an inanimate catastrophe: âfor if,â continues Mons. Diderot, âthe above comparison is just; if it is true that there will be so much less of discourse as there is more of action, there ought to be more dialogue than incident in the former acts, and more incident than dialogue in the latter.â Whence 'twas discover'd, that Philumena Was she who had been ravish'd, and the child Conceiv'd from that encounter.âThat I've been The instrument of all these joys I'm glad, Tho' other courtezans would not be so; Nor is it for our profit and advantage, That lovers should be happy in their marriage. But never will I, for my calling'-sake, Suffer ingratitude to taint my mind. I found him, while occasion gave him leave, Kind, pleasant, and good-humour'd: and this marriage Happen'd unluckily, I must confess. Yet I did nothing to estrange his love; And since I have receiv'd much kindness from him, 'Tis fit I shou'd endure this one affliction. SCENE IV. Enter at a distance PAMPHILUS and PARMENO. Pam. Be sure you prove this to me, Parmeno; Prithee, be sure on't. Do not bubble me With false and short-liv'd joy. Par. 'Tis even so. Pam. For certain? Par. Ay, for certain. Pam. I'm in heaven, If this be so. Par. You'll find it very true. Pam. Hold, I beseech you.âI'm afraid, I think One thing, while you relate another. Par. Well? Pam. You said, I think, âthat Myrrhina discover'd âThe Ring on Bacchis' finger, was her own.â Par. She did. Pam. âThe same I gave her formerly. ââAnd Bacchis bad you run and tell me this.â Is it not so? Par. I tell you, Sir, it is. Pam. Who is more fortunate, more blest than I? âWhat shall I give you for this news? what? what? I don't know. Par. But I know. Pam. What? Par. Just nothing. For I see nothing of advantage to you, Or in the message, or myself. Pam. Shall I Permit you to go unrewarded; you, Who have restor'd me ev'n from death to life? Ah, Parmeno, d'ye think me so ungrateful? âBut yonder's Bacchis standing at the door. She waits for me, I fancy. I'll go to her. Bacc. seeing him.] Pamphilus, save you! Pam. Bacchis! my dear Bacchis! My guardian, my protectress! Bacc. All is well: And I'm o'erjoy'd at it. Pam. Your actions speak it. You're still the charming girl I ever found you. Your presence, company, and conversation, Come where you will, bring joy and pleasure with them. Bacc. And you, in faith, are still the same as ever, The sweetest, most engaging man on earth. Pam. Ha! ha! ha! that speech from you, dear Bacchis? Bacc. You lov'd your wife with reason, Pamphilus: Never, that I remember, did I see her Before to-day; and she's a charming woman. Pam. Speak truth! Bacc. So heaven help me, Pamphilus! Pam. Say, have you told my father any part Of this tale? Bacc. Not a word. Pam. Nor is there need. Let all be hush! I would not have it here, As in a comedy, Terence here with reason endeavours to make the most of a circumstance peculiar to his play. In other Comedies, every body, Actors as well as Spectators, are at last equally acquainted with the whole intrigue and Catastrophe; and it would even be a defect in the plot, were there any obscurity remaining. But Terence, like a true Genius, makes himself superior to Rules, and adds new beauties to his piece by forsaking them. His reasons for concealing from part of the personages of the Drama the principal incident of the Plot, are so plausible and natural, that he could not have followed the beaten track without offending against manners and decency. This bold and uncommon turn is one of the chief graces of the Play. Dacier. See the notes to the third act of this Comedy. where every thing Is known to every body. Here, those persons Whom it concerns, already know it; They, Who 'twere not meet should know it, never shall. Bacc. I promise you, it may with ease be hid. Myrrhina told Phidippus, that my oath Convinc'd her, and she held you clear. Pam. Good! good! All will be well, and all, I hope, end well. Par. May I know, Sir, what good I've done to-day? And what's the meaning of your conversation? Pam. No. Par. I suspect however.ââI restore him From death to life?ââwhich way?â Pam. Oh, Parmeno, You can't conceive the good you've done to-day, From what distress you have deliver'd me. Par. Ay, but I know, and did it with design. Pam. Oh, I'm convinc'd of that. [ironically. Par. Did Parmeno Ever let slip an opportunity Of doing what he ought, Sir? Pam. Parmeno, In after me! Par. I follow.âBy my troth, I've done more good to-day without design, Than ever with design in all my life.â Clap your hands! Terence had recourse to the expedient of double plots. And this, I suppose, is what gained him the reputation of being the most artificial writer for the Stage. The Hecyra [The Step-Mother] is the only one of his Comedies, of the true antient cast. And we know how it came off in the representation. That ill success and the simplicity of its conduct have continued to draw upon it the same unfavourable treatment from the critics, to this day; who constantly speak of it, as much inferior to the rest; whereas, for the genuine beauty of dramatick design and the observance, after the ancient Greek manner, of the nice dependency and coherence of the fable, throughout, it is, indisputably, to every reader of true taste, the most masterly and exquisite of the whole collection. Hurd's Notes on the Epistle to Augustus. Though I would not attempt to justify the town-criticks of the days of Terence, who passed a sentence of absolute condemnation on this Comedy, yet I cannot think that it failed merely for want of duplicity of intrigue; nor that the Criticks of Horace's time esteemed Terence the most artificial writer for the stage, only because he combined two stories into one. May we not, at this day, speak of the uncommon art of Terence in the preparation of his incidents, and conduct of his fable, without being supposed to imply a particular commendation of his double plots? and may we not allow the beauty of design in writing on a single plot, and yet at the same time discover so many capital defects in the conduct of a particular piece, as may reduce it to a much lower standard of merit than that of other Comedies constructed on a less correct model? Tous les genres, says Mons. Voltaire, sont bons, hors le genre ennuyeux. For my part, I had much rather see or read the Comedy of the Provoked Husband, which so flagrantly transgresses the unity of action that it is almost two plays in one, than the cold production of any affected lover of simplicity, who, on the sole merit of a single plot, tells a dull story in a dull manner, without any interest of incident, strength of character, or vivacity of dialogue. It is not the insertion of an Episode that will enliven the fable; but the just delineation of character and proper conduct of the plot, simple or complicated, that gives it spirit. Mons. Voltaire justly observed, in his letters on our nation, that the Love-Episode in Addison's Cato throws a languor on the whole piece. The Theatre affords a constant evidence of the same fact in Tate's alteration of King Lear; and, to instance rather in Comedy, the Andrian of our Author would be much better without the story of Charinus. Interesting incidents, however, there must be: or insipidity will ensue, unless the attention be diverted from examining the plot, by Buffoonery; which is as vicious in the manners of Comedy, as Pantomime changes in the fable. Terence, âwhose taste was abhorrent from ribaldry,â has, I think, in this play suffered the interest of his piece to languish; and if there is any just observation in the preceding notes, there is a lameness, notwithstanding the simplicity, in the conduct of the fable. The first act, being entirely consumed in narration, is very inartificial, and what is still worse, redundant; the discovery of the main incident is made in the most uninteresting manner, by a long soliloquy in the third act; and the catastrophe itself is managed in the same cold manner, by another long soliloquy; the incidents, that should have filled the fifth act, being injudiciously precluded by what is supposed to pass in the preceding interval.âIn point of character also, The Step-Mother has much less merit than the rest of our author's pieces. Laches and Phidippus are far inferior to Simo, Menedemus, Chremes, Micio, Demea, &amp;c. nor is Pamphilus equal to the Pamphilus of the Andrian, or PhÃ¦dria, or Ãschinus, &amp;c.âThis play has by some Criticks been coupled with the Self-Tormentor for purity of stile and beauty of sentiment. It is not void of those graces, no more than it is wholly destitute of art in the construction of the plot, but surely it possesses them in a much less eminent degree than the Self-Tormentor. Can the narration of Parmeno, not to dwell on its being needless, be compared with that of Menedemus? or with that of Simo in the Andrian; or that of Geta in the Phormio?âI have endeavoured to omit no opportunity of taking notice of the beautiful passages of this play; and I have indeed been more than ordinarily assiduous to point them out, in order to shew that in the most indifferent productions of a great author, there are some things worthy our attention and imitation. On the whole, however, I am sorry to be obliged to differ once more from the learned and ingenious Critick above cited: And I cannot help thinking it rather singular, that he, who every where maintains that character is the chief object of Comedy, should yet seem to draw conclusions directly opposite to these premises, and not only prefer Terence (whose artificial fables rendered him popular) to all other Comick Dramatists, but also rank the Step-Mother, merely on account of âthe nice dependency and coherence of the fable,â higher in merit than any other of his pieces, confessedly more rich in character. I must own that, so far from being able to acquiesce in the opinion, that âit is, indisputably, to every reader of true taste, the most masterly and exquisite of the whole collection,â I am, in this instance, much rather inclined to say with Volcatius, Sumetur Hecyra sexta ex ijs fabula. âThe last, and least in merit of the six.â Mons. Diderot, so often mentioned in these notes, has given us two excellent serious Comedies, Le Fils Naturel, and Le PÃ©re de Famille: in the conduct of the first, if I am not deceived, he seems to have kept his eye on the Step-Mother, and in the second on The Brothers; and, in my opinion, he has gone as far beyond Terence in the Fils Naturel, as he has fallen short of him in the PÃ©re de Famille.</field>
