      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scena Prima. Enter Forestee and Lvcio. Forest. I must not be so rude as to beleeue That you (my Lord) can your affections set; Vpon a Mayde, so humble in her birth As she you name, for regard of honour Doe not mock the sister of your seruant. Lucio. This way to madnesse leads, teach not my heart Such modern Heraldry. Let it dispose Of charitable thoughts, with naturall eies, Vnlimmited by customary forme, Which gaine, and nicetie haue made an Art, Virtue, not blood enobles vs, and ernes Her atribute, without hereditary helpe From ancestors. O my deere Foreste? Thy sister with such noble wealth is fraught, That to be couetous for her, appeares, A holy sinne. But thou art cruell growne Thy memory is sick. The old effects That witnesse how I loue thy learned soule, Are quite forgot. Fores. Young Lord, disclaime that thought! Heare I Promulgate, you my Patron are; You found me in estate so poore, so lowe, That you were faine to stoope to lift me vp, You are the Dukes Creature! who doates by Art, Who in his loue, and kindnesse, Method keepes: He holdeth thus his Armes, in fearefull care Not to bruse you with his deere embracements, And what is she whose Virgin blood disdaines To quench your lawfull fire? or whom the Duke Would not procure to climbe your Marriage bed Vpon her Knees? And shall I then (Like to the treacherous Moone) striue to eclipe The Sunne that giues me light? Shall i consent That she, that tumbled in a Wombe with me, Shall giue your Issue birth? The royall Duke Would thanke me for such charitie. My Lord Though you are wise, you are but young. Lucio. Heart of Viper! Sure, Time hath lost his feathers from his Heeles, Marke how slow he goes? Shall I neere be olde That my designes may repute haue, And credit in the World. I doe not aske Thy Sister for my Whore; but for my Wife. Fores. Sir t'is already ioynd vnto my Creede: For I would eate your Heart, should it contriue A way in thought, how to cheate my Sister Of her pure Chastitie. I loue you so That I with care suppose; She not deserues To be your Wife, and so esteeme of her That she is much too good, to be your Whore. In this new Argument, I am too bolde, You know my duty well. The Dukes abroad Though but the birth of day. Goe Sir! Enter Duke, Castruchio, Dorido, Cosimo, Page: and Followers. Duke. My glorious Boy, you are too vigilant: The Sunne, and you, doe visite me at once. This courtship is not safe. You must not meete Your Louer, with a Riuall, glorious As your selfe. Foreste! welcome from Genoa, How fares our Brother Cardinall? Fores. In health, and ease. He badde me tell your Grace It was a deed of charitie to thinke Him worthy of this same great imployment. And this letter he humbly recommends To your perusall. Duke reads the Letter to himselfe. Cast. How can it choose But choke the very Soule, and bruse the Heart To thinke that such a giddy Snipe: a Foole (That meerely liues to disparage Nature) Should creepe to this ambitious gouernment. Still he rules the Ruler. The Duke is Ward Vnto a Page; whose Eie-browes weare more Beard, Then doth his Chinne: And there's his Instrument, A darke fellow; that with disguised Lookes Could cheat an Hypocrite, older then Time. Dorid. I'ue heard a better Character of both, Such, as to the young Count, Witt, and vallour giues: Vnto Foreste, honest Spirits. Cast. Report is then become a Bawde to Luck; Whom Fortune do henrich, Fame doth flatter. Duke. Sure this tame Priest will make vs all Cowards. We must a truce confirme with Genoa. Well, be it so. Where now (my noble Boy) Shall I occasion finde, to testifie That you deserue my loue, by vertue of your owne? In sickely times, when Warre and ciuill Spleene Besiege the Heart, with treacherous designes, A friend shall find a cause to make him knowne, But now in faire weather: I neede not aske What Houell's nere? Lucio. In this, I dare discredite Fate. They are not so wealthy in affliction: With sorrow so well stor'd; as could suffice To trie my sufferance: in the behalfe Of you my Prince, and still royall Master. Duke. Dar'st thou then die for me? Heereâmake thy selfe a sacrifice to Fame, Profers him a naked Ponyard. Take it: and I will be thy Chronicler. Lucio. It were (Sir) but ingratitude in me To lessen thus, the number sanctifide Of your true friends. Be you pleas'd to sheath it, In that same part, which you doe most abhorre. Duke. O Lucio! thou art my Earewig now, Creep'st in my eare, to feast vpon my Braines. When in my priuate graue I lye inclos'd, More silent then my ruin'd Fame: no tongue Shall pay his tribute to my memory But thine: for thou art likely to suruiue. Thy yeares are few, but full of gratitude.â Come: hye we to the Parke: The sprightfull morne Giues motion wings, and libertie to those Whom lamenesse stakes vnto the ground. Cast. Royall dotard, like tinder, thou dost waste Thy forced fire: to giue another light Whose sawcy flame will darken thine. Monstrous! Dorid. Why dost thou spend thy gall in secret thus? A pox vpon't: turne thoughts to action: Heauen knowes, I had rather enrich my selfe, Then enuy others wealth. Imploy thy brayne. Get the Dukes fist to this; and thou shalt share Fiue hundred Crownes. Cast. What is't? Dorid. The old businesse. Cast. And not yet sign'd: This t'is to be modest. Had I had reputation in thy Creede Enter Foreste. It had beene done long since. There's my agent. Hence and prouide me thanks. Saue you Signior. Fores. You may with charitie. Cast. Am I in your remembrance sir? Fores. Signior Castruchio as I take you. Cast. The same. Because I neuer did desire To gaine by being troublesome, I lost The deere benifit of the practique part. Custom's a sutors safe encourager. I the Duke haue seru'd, since I was able To serue my selfe. Yet neuer had the luck To get by it: and as the times promise, Neuer shall: Vnlesse I imitate the Crab, And find my way (as he doth his) backwards. That is, to make petition to the foote That he will please t'instruct, and teach the head When to comiserate my affaire. Fores. Signior. I neede a comment to your words. Cast. If you will mooue my Lord (the Count) To get the Dukes faire hand, subscribed heere; Then shall I feele my selfe well vnderstood. Fores. Sir my abillities are most pregnant When I find I may be profitable To any Courtiers iust, and modest sute. I pray what sense carries the inscription? Cast. Only this Sir. There is an Engine made Which spends its strength by force of nimble wheeles, For they once screwed vp, in their returne Will riue on Oake: but with such subtill force That motion giues no leasure to impediment. The large and ponderous Logge is soone consum'd, To shauings more transparant then a Glasse. Of these the skilfull Boxes make, Scabbards, Sheathes, Cheasts, and molds for childrens Cabinets. Fores. Trust me an Engine of importance great! But now, what would the Enginere himselfe? Cast. Faith Signior, nought but a Monopoly For all those wares, his Engine makes. Fores. Keepe it. Good sir keepe it. A monopoly Why sir the common-wealth hath beene so crush'd, With th'insulting Charter of such Patents, That now the very word defiles the cause. I had thought you Signior would haue ingag'd My industry in such a sute as might No way disparedg though it did enrich; Howeuer not abuse the publique weale. Cast. Very good Sir. My Lord the Count, your selfe (His seruile Instrument) and some others, Of this new faction that now, engrosse All Offices, and send your Scoutes abroad Intelligencers strict, that bring you home The number, and the rate of what your selues, Or others in the darke can put to sale. Nature hath not altered yet: the first And antick method to preserue our breaths. We must eate bread if we intend to liue; Which how to get (vnlesse this humble way That you deride) In troth I cannot tell. It makes me mad to thinke you should expose Vs Men of Heart, to those fastidious helpes That scape your owne acceptance. Your wide Threats, That soone will swallow any thing which fills Although it nourish not. A pox vpon you all! Fores. I did expect you would begin to rayle. Good troubled Soule! I knew you well before. You are the only Man, whose wealthy Muse Doth furnish all the Fidlers in the State With desp'rate Ballads, and inuectiue Songs. Libells of such weake fancy and composure That we doe all esteeme it greater wrong T'haue our Names extant in such paltery Ryme Then in the slanderous sence. Cast. Very well Sir! Fores. You, you must be a Satyrist forsooth, Calumniate by instinct and inspiration. As if iust Heauen would borrow Gall of you, Where with to write our faults. (O strict account!) Your Gall, which in the Pen so ouerflowes, That still it blots, where in inscribs. You imitate the propertie of Doggs, Who barke and snarle most at him they know not For else among all those you scandalize Why nam'd you me? (almost a stranger to your Eye) My Ancestors that built no Monument For their fames to dwell in; You also bring Into the knowledge of the criticke World. Why I could neuer see thee yet but drunke: Which makes thy Verses reele and stagger so. Cast. Come sir! We may exchange one thrust vnseene. They draw fight, close, Fore flings down Cas &amp; disarmes him. Fores. A prety Curr! dare it bite as well as barke! How now sir, your Mathematicall thrusts! Then haue at yeâYeeld me thy Sword, or else thou dy'st. I haue no ioy to set at liberty A Soule so vnprepar'd. And as thou art My Enemy, I take a full reuenge, By suffering thy corrupted blood to dwell Enter a Monke. And taint within thy vaines. W'are discoueredâ Take thy sword Now get thee home and rayle vpon't, Because t'would fight no better. Cast. Yet we may meete i'th'darke. You haue a throat And there are Kniues in Italy. Exit Castruchio. Forest. A good day attend my ghostly Father. Doth this your tariance heere discouer ought, You would with me? Monke. Your leasure shall produce my vtterance. O Sonne, your fame is of complexion cleere, Such as ensnares the virtuous Eye to loue And adoration. Such as would procure All the skilfull Angels sutors to her, And such as serues for my encouragement For I no letters haue from Noble friends, Which a requitall from themselues inuite, By Courtship bold, and troublesome to others, Nor am I with that wicked mettall stor'd, That rules the mighty, and betrayes the minde To toyle in a designe, which angers Heauen, And makes the Deuill blush. But yet (deere Sonne) I haue a suite to thee. Fores. Which I desire to know. Monke, In the ancient Covent of S. Austine There is a holy brother lately dead, Whose place if you will but confirme on me By the Dukes letter to the brother-hood, Then shall I better leasure haue to pray For you my Patron. Fores. Alas my Father! The times are more obseruant to your Tribe. It is the method now that your deserts Need not to vsher but succeed reward. The Treatise (written lately) to confute, The desperate sect in Mantua, calls it you The Author? Monke. It knowes no other. Fores. There your preferment safely taketh roote. Beleeue me (ghostly Father) I will choose The fittest time to woke in your behalfe. Monke. Heauen prosper your designes. Exit Monke. Forest. What throngs of great impediments besiege The vertuous minde? so thick in multitude, They iostle one another as they come. Hath Vice a charter got, that none must rise But such, who of the Deuils faction are? The way to honour is not euermore The way to Hell: a vertuous Man may climbe. Let the flatterer sell his Lies, else-where It is vnthrifty merchandize to change My gold for breath. Of all Antagonists Most charitie I finde in enuious men. For they doe sooner hurt themselues, then hurt Or me, or him, that rays'd me vp. An enuious man is made of thoughts. To ruminate much doth melt the braine, And make the heart grow leane. Such men as these: That in opposing waste their proper strengths: That sacrifice themselues in silly hope, To butcher vs; saue Reuenge a labour, And dye to make experiment of Wrath. Let Fame discourse aloud vntill she want An Antidote: I am not scar'd with noyse. Heere I dismisse my feares. If I can swell (Vnpoyson'd by those helpes, which Heauen forbids) Fond loue of ease, shall neere my soule dehort: Maugre all flattery, enuy, or report. Exit Foreste. Sutors within. O good your Grace heare vs, heare the complaints Of vs poore Men: O heare vs! we are all Vndone! Good your Honour heare vs. Enter Duke and Lucio. Duke. Death encounter 'em! Lucio shut the doore! Tis the plague of greatnesse, the curse Of pompe, that in our darkest priuacie, wee must Euen publique be to euery Mans affaires. How now! All these sawcy Troopes of brawling Sutors, attend on you my glorious Boy. Lucio. It is their humble skill not to arriue Before your Grace, but by an Aduocate A Mediatour blessed in your Eies. Duke. How apt am I to loue! yet now obserue Vnkindnesse in my care, and bitternesse In Physicke. I study how to make thee lesse That I may make thee more and more my owne. Office and Dignity are Enemies To health and ease. Respect growes tedious Obseruance troublesome, where ti's most due. He that giues his Soule no more imployment Then what's her owne: may sleepe within a Drumme While busie Hearts, that loue to vndertake Beyond their reach of yeeres: are faine to vse Drowsie potions yet watch the Winter night With more distinction then the Parish Clocke. Could'st thou resigne thy titles and thy cares To make me yet more capable of still Enioying thee? Lucio. My zeale vnto my selfe forbids my speech. Since if I make reply to this, I but Disparedge duty, and consume my breath. Where fight is young, and cleere, there Spectacles Are troublesome; and rather hide, then shew The obiect. The most deuout obedience Which I shall euer owe vnto your Grace Becomes my heart, much better then my tongue. Duke. But yet obserue (my Lucio) Th'vnkind tricks of Nature: how we are fool'd By a religious constancy in Loue. A Princes hate doth ruine where it falls: But his affection warmeth where it shines Vntill it kindle fire to scorch himselfe. If we are subiect to the sinne of Heauen, (Too much charitie) extreamity of loue: Let there be mercy shewen in punishment. Why is the corrupted vse of Royall loue Imputed to our charge, to our Audit layd? We that with all those Organs furnish'd are All those faculties naturall in Men: Yet limitted in vse of each: prescrib'd Our conuersation, by a sawcy forme Of State. How can we choose (by this restraint) But struggle more for liberty? make choise Of some one Eare; wherein to empty out our Soules, When they are full of busie thoughts; of plotts Abortiue, crude, and thinne. T'is cheape, and base For Maiestie not to be singular In all effects. O then, if I must giue my heart To the command of one: send him (sweete Heauen!) A modest appetite: teach him to know The stomacke sooner surfeits with too much, Then starues for lacke of that supply Which couetous Ambition calleth want. For when my Friend beggs, my bounty then Concludes to make me poore before that he Shall so vnthrifty be of breath to aske in vaine. Distraction! tamenesse! O my Lucio. How canst thou conster this. After I haue chid I seeme to flatter thee. Lucio. My gracious Lord!â Duke. Peaceâ I will no more imploy my memory Thus to discourage thine. Where's Foreste! T'is fit he know you are not vigilant In his behalfe. Farelo de Sforza (My old Secretary) is newly dead: The place is his. I shall expect no thankes From you, nor yet from him: My bounty is requited in her choice. Lucio. Your Grace will bring vs both within the reach Of publique enuy. Duke. Thou now would'st certifie, His birth obscure and base discourageth Such earnest helpe to his so great promotion. Not a iot: Know my Boy! t'is the vulgar, Not the Royall trade to patch vp things: Or seeke to mend what was before of qualitie Perfect enough it selfe. To make a Man Of nothing: why this same creation Enclines a little neere Diuinitie. Neere the old performance; which from Chaos Drew this multitude of subtill formes. Lucio. Since you (the royall maker) doe commend The mettall, and your workemanshippe; it shewes There's little skill in those which enuy him. Foreste is your Creature. Many times I doe acquaint him what the generall voyce Doth vrge in his disgrace. He laughs it out And sweares he would not loose that priuiledge Which Nature gaue him by her kinde mistake In his natiuitie, for the Seas worth. As if from's Issue, he could ne're deserue. A Monument, vnlesse himselfe doe hewe The stones whereof t'is built: vnlesse he raise His Monument on a Wart; his dignitie On pouertie obscure and base. Duke. We doe affect his thoughts. Such industry Proclaimes him fit for high designes: Some Men Attend the talking Drumme, and riddle out Their liues on Earth; with Madnesse Sophistry: Calling their losse, their gaine, danger, delight. Some men conuerse with Bookes, and melt the braine In sullen study how to vindicate The liberall Arts. Those loose formalitie, Then grow Methodicall; and dy i'th' darke. Some practise rules of State, and suffer much For Honors sake: nay tread vpon themselues At first; to reach the higher. Some pursue The Plough; and in their wholesome sweat doe swimme. And some that furnish'd are with nimbler soules, Imploy their times in wanton exercise; Masques and Reuells: the complements of Loue, And Loue I finde the easiest vanity. Lucio. O gentle Corsa! make it so with me, Faine would I (if I durst) reueale to him a noyse within The heate of my affection, and where t'is fix'd. Duke. Hearke: sure the gallery doore is left vnlockt. Are we debard all place of priuacie? Nature in vs hath lost her vulgar right. A loude, bawling sutor; doth not waken Charitie, but deafen her. A shame vpon 'em all! In Lucio. Exeunt Duke &amp; Lucio. Enter Sutors at the other doore. 1. Heauen blesse his Grace! 2. Amen: and my Lord the Count's good Honor. 3. Friend! went the Duke this way? 2. Heere. This way. 3. Pray shew me him: they call Signior Lucio 2. The Count. Come, I'le shew you him. 1. Follow, follow, follow. Exeunt. Enter Dorido and Cosimo. Dor. Dost heere? Cosimo. Cosi. What sayst thou? Dor. I prethee stay, why slip but heere aside: And thou shalt see the most resplendent Fopp, That euer did discredit Nature. Signior Lothario; a Countrey Gentleman But now the Court Baboone: who perswades himselfe, (Out of a new kinde of madnesse) to be enter Lothario, Borachio. The Dukes fauorite. He comes. Th'other is A bundle of Prouerbs: whom he seduc'd From the Plough; to serue him for Preferment. Lotha. Borachio. Bor. My Lord? Loth. Suruay my garments round, and then declare If I haue hit it? Bor. You haue sir: but not the marke. Loth. What marke? thou bold Parishioner of Hell. Bor. Why Sir, the marke I aime at: Preferment. After a storme, comes a calme: the harder You blow, the sooner your Cheekes will ake: and he That cares for your anger, may haue more of't When he list, for my part, I know my Mother. Loth. The froward Sisters haue conspir'd Slaue! Dog Wilt thou neuer leaue this immense folly? Can nothing serue these dull Lippes but Prouerbs? Bor. Sir, I know none of your Prouerbs. First come, First seru'd. These words that are neerest the tongue, Haue opportunitie soonest to leaue The mouth. Loth. Is it then decreed, I must grow mad? Bor. I'le be no more flowted, nor brus'd, not I What need my Lord, be beholding to me For's mirth; when he may laugh at's owne folly? Besides though motion and exercise Be good for grosse bodies; therefore, must they Of the Guard, pitch me vp and downe like a barre! Loth. Sa, sa, sa, A mutinie in Heauen! Bor. If there be; You are not likely to come Thither to appease it, first end this quarrell Vpon earth, I haue seru'd you this sixe Moneths, In hope of an Office; and am no more An Officer then she that bore me. Loth. Alas poore foole! I pitty thee. Thou wilt beleeue nothing But that which may be seene or vnderstood. I say thou art an Officer. Or if thou art not Thou shalt be; which is better: for that fame Which we now enioy is in some danger To be lost: but that which we neuer had Cannot be lost before we haue it. Bora. O rare conclusion! Loth. Besides. Looke heere and then reioyce, Is the Count (Whom they call my Riuall ith' Dukes fauour) Is he (I say) accoutred like to me? Why his sleeues sit like stockins on his Armes. His Breeches are like two Clokebags, halfe sowde Together in the Twist: and his other Garments shew like Playsters on him. Follow. And make thy fortune fat. Bora. Well. He that still expects, but tires his hope, What One cannot, another can: t'is so With dayes and houres too. And for my part Let Glasse runne out. Exeunt Loth. Bor. Dorid. His Man's as full of Prouerbs As a Constable: he coyns 'em himselfe. Cos. And such another Heade-peece fill'd with Whay As is the Master heere, the Sunne nere saw. Dorid. He walkes like a Zealand-storke. Cast. But sure the Duke Enables error in their fancy, by some Behauiour equiualent to what The Master, and the Man expect: for else Folly cannot be so sickely-Eied; but time Will giue it strength to know it selfe. Dorid. Why sir; this dignifies the least. They scarce Ere saw the Duke: and are lesse knowne Vnto the world. His Grace well apprehends, These voluntary mistakes of Nature, In preseruation of their intellects, Are fitter subiects for accidentall mirth, Then a Comicall continuance. It is A leuitie too humble in a Prince To heede such trifles. Cos. NayâPrethee lead the way. Exeunt omnes.</field>

Forest. I was assur'd before. This is the time, In which I shall oblige posteritie Or fall (my wench) by flattering error. Hast thou to my sister counsaile giuen? Instructions safe! whereby her actions May warrant her promotion well deseru'd. Luin. It was my tongues last imployment. Fores. I would haue her weare her growing fortunes, In a handsome fashion: Doe but obserue The vnpollish'd garbe of Citty dames: of those Whom fathers purse-strings hoyse vp to honor. How they doe sucke their Chinnes into their Neckes. Simper with vnskilfull leuetie: and trip On their wanton Toes, like Kibe-heel'd-Fayries.

Fores. My good Lord, The prouerbe will perswade you: To be bold, with whats your owne. Your title's strong, both to the house, and me. Lucio. I am in debt for both. wilt thou not chide To see my heart assume this libertie Musick. Vpon my Tongue: before it rightly knowes Thy sisters heart: The Duke consent, as yet vnasked too: harke? Fores. Cease that noyse, tis troublesome: cease Muse. Lucio. How Foreste? Hast thou eares? and wilt thou Sence such hopefull harmony, or is Thy thrift vnnaturall, wilt thou forbid Thy friend to share in what is good, sweet tongue And hand, persist in what your kindnesse profferd. Fores. Obey him, if the musick not deserue Your strict attention: You must blame your selfe. Song. Lucio. Shew me the way Foreste: Fores. Whither sir? Lucio.

Stay SirâIf she consent but to abuse The propertie of motion in such kinde As may exalt her person but on such Aboue this height: I am her enemy For euermore. Consider what you doe. She brings no portion but humilitie, If her first payment faile: who dares assure The future debt? Pray looke into her lappe: You'le finde she comes not from the East enrich'd With Diamonds, bright wealth: whose wanton worth Vnskilfull fancy prises not from vse But from the idolatrous doting of the eie. Her chaste obedience is all her dowrie. O bitter speech! it cuts my very soule To thinke that fortune should create vs two Meere patterns of your charitie. Lucio. Dare you authorize this Idolatry?

So blessed in their Issue, that when time Shall thinke them fit to taste the priuiledge Of Death: they shall not need a Monument Yet dwell as chiefe i'th' memory of Fame. Corsa. Amen, Amen. Lucio. Such is my prayer too. O Foreste! Excessiue ioy disturbs my vtterance. My words are parted on my tongue. O speake! Thou know'st my heart!

He sends his wormes To Bookes, to old Records: and they deuoure Th'inscription. He loues Ingratitude; For he destroyd the memory of Man: But I shall neere forget on what strange termes You take me to your bed. Lucio. Excellent wretch! I am vndone with ioy I will not blame the Coward to feare death, Since the world containes such ioy as this. Why doe you weepe Lady? can you suppose Foreste would consent to what is done, Vnlesse he knew there were no danger in't? Sure his Mother was a Sibyll; he sees With a prophetique aime; the end of his Designes; before they come to action. He is too wise to erre. Why weepe you then? Corsa. It is a folly in my Eies. I know not why they weepe: vnlesse they weepe Because they now haue lost their libertie; Heeretofore each man, which chance presented, Was to them a lawfull obiect: but now, They are to looke on none but you.

Though Modesty would suffer me to boast, Yet t'were not in the power of breath, to make My ioy so knowne, as it is felt. Lucio.

I know him. He sings like Phalaris Bull. Cos. I supposd at first, he would haue sent him A Challenge. Dor. But that's contingent now: Foreste Being made Secretary of State. Cos. I'haue heard o'th' new edict, which institutes A misterious toy, i'th' Hatband, for those Of the faction. Dor. Why about two dayes since: one of the sect Sent me a Challenge. Because my sister Drunke his Lords health, with her Quoife on. Each houre These giddy Participles doe imbarque Themselues for Duels. The one is a kinne To my honorable Lady.

We shall haue your Thrush, in a Cage shortly. Remember, who you deale withall. Cast. Hang him, dull, open slaue, His thoughts may be Discernd, through the shauing of a deale bord. I'le sift and winnow him, in an old hat. Dor. Prethee (sweete Castruchio) leaue thy barkeing. 'T will be treason shortly for any man, To carry eares, within three miles of thy Tongue. Cast. Why Signior, what Faction are you of: Dor. Not of your faction (Sir) if none returne Vnto the prison for your libelling. You remember your Vicesâstrip'd, and whip'd. Your trimme Eclogues, the fulsome Satyr too, Written to his Grace. Wherein you flatter, Whine, and damne your selfe to get a pardon For what seemes there a resolute offence. Satyrs, are more vsefull, now then euer. Nor grieues it me to see the humour vs'd, But thus abus'd. To see a Bard still reach At holy Bayes. Passion o'me! I'le tell thee. Thy Rimes include not so much Braines, as would Suffice to fill a Cherry-stone. Cast. Yo'ld faine make me angry. Dor. I, with thy selfe. Cos. And then thou spend'st thy Gall, with more iustice, Then when, thou rayl'st against Foreste. Cast. Cry you mercy (precious Cox) Hath Foreste, So great a share in your tongue too?

Encircled with a Mote that flowes with Lhasisâ Cast. Deriu'd their Augury from the warme Entrailes Of a Calfe. Bor. Sir. These are some of those, that laugh'd at yee In the presence. Loth.

Seignior Lothario, the great Minion To our Duke: I greet your health, with all ioy. Cos. And I with all humility. Dorid. And I with all celerity. Loth. Hearke! thou dull Sinner. Is this reall? hah? Bora. Sir, let him, that hath a heart of his owne Thinke what he list. Loth. Doe they adore, or floute me now? Bora. All is witchcraft. I know when the Moone winks There's something in't, besides an ecclips. Loth. Miscreant: What suspitious follys Dost thou creat within that Wodden-skull? And with what Heathen-phrase vtter'd? Know Dogg, If I imploy my wrathâ Bora. Allas sir I'ue more faults then misbeliefe. Therefore giue me your blessing, and let me Goe home in peace. T'is true, when the skie falls We shall haue Larkes. But let weaker stomachs, Expect such curious meate. I can eate Oates, and Garlick, vnder my owne Roofe. Dorid. How? will Borachio leaue the Court? Cast. What accident of dire portent is fallne? Loth. Gentlemen applaude my patience: Because, He cannot furnish me with wholesome Sutes, He doubts my power to get 'em granted. Cast. Why we, will furnish him with Sutes. Bora. But wont yee floute, and play the knaue with one? Cast. How (Knaue!) was that the word? Bora. Interpret the word as your selfe shall please. I scorne to be your Dictionary. Marry come vp: Are your cares so tender? I hope I'm a Man, although a sinner. Cast. Vse no choller Amorous childe. But if Thou wantest sutes, thy Lord being neere the Duke, May furnish thee withâ Cos. Or me thinks thou would'st become a knighthood Get him to begg it for thee. Bora. No, no. Hot words make but warme aire, A figg For a Knight-errant; that hath a stile, and nere a hedge. Dorid. Then get a Patent to suruay Brine-pits. Or else for casting Ordinance in Lome. Cast. Or else search Saint Peters patrimony, Lay Prebendrys are good, and Symony Is an old Paradox. Bora. Holde, holde Enough sufficeth all women but whores. He that expects the Morning lengthens the Night Therefore straitway let my Lord get the Duke To signe these Patents: which done I'le returne to the wife of my bowels, And dye for ioy. Cast. Why this, is fit, and requisite. Cos. If Signior Lothario doe consent. Loth. It is decreed. Bora. Who would hasten Time, when we may be old Too soone. Let me take downe a Cushion, and pray. For I shall haue more dignitie then will suffice To damne a Monke. Cast. Who could perish in a better cause? Bora. Why, can I helpe it? If a man be borne To Offices. Or as my Master sayd, Predestinate in the wombe of greatnesse. Tis not our faults. Each man obayes his Starre, In spight of his Teeth, Dor. All this is Alcaron Bora. One thing grieues me. I'ue a badd memory Already, and now t'will be made worse. Cast. How can preferment hurt thy memory? Bora. O Sir! preferment makes a man forget His deerest friends; nay his kindred too. Cos. Looke, Thy Master's building more Castles, in the Aire. Cast. He has intelligence from Spaine, and fortefies, To no purpose gainst the next Spring. Loth. All offices shall be sold i'th' darkeâ Bora. How! Grow not old in anothers garment, Sell what's your owne, Some of those offices Are mine by promise. Loth. Still, crosse to my designes. Ile stretch your Sinwsâ Dor. Hold! Signior Lothario, hold! Mercy Becomes the powerfull, Bora. Let the Deuill take the Knighthood, and make His Damme a Lady. I'le not be his Asse, Exit Bor. Loth. running after him. That seru'd for blowes, and Prouander. Dor. Lets relieue Borachio, or all our Comick Scenes Are at an end. Exeunt Omnes. Chaire out. Enter Duke and Foreste. Duke. Foreste. Fores. My gracious Lord. Duke. Are yet our Letters to his Holinesse Dispatch'd? Fores. They are so please your Grace. Duke. Did the French Embassador make some shew Of discontent at his departure hence? Fores. Both in his words and lookes: for when he heard Th'English-Leiger had oppos'd his Treaty Concerning traffique with the Florentine, His anger straight dismissed the Argument, And seiz'd vpon the Nation, nay rayl'd 'Against the Leiger too, whose opposition, Might be chidden as too nice a Virtue, But could not be accused as a vice, Tis knowne indeed the French doe take a pride, In the emphasis of sudden anger, As if alacritie in ill did make, The fault looke handsomely, and dulnesse adde Deformitie to sinne. Duke. Tis faithfully obseru'd. Fores. Swell'd with vncharitable pride: such as Admits no stile of Neighbour; as if growne Aboue the vse of friendshippe. They seeme to call Those mighty Ilanders neerest their soyle, Poore borderers to their Continent. Such, Whose thinne numbers, haue in bloudy battaile, Made their multitudes their impediments, Worne their Ensignes, instead of gaudy Skarfes. Duke. The chance of war, Admitteth many times of Miracles, Euen such, as doe discredit History, High-prouidence confers the conquest there, Where probability conferd the losse. And this is done, that we may attribute The prayse to him that gaue the victory, Not to them that got it. Obserue besides, That when the weake doe ouercome: the strong, Doe leaue that staine, for their Posteritie To wipe away: which is already done; The French, haue fiery nimble spirits. Fores. Your Grace deales iustly in your praise. They haue Spirits: but they all are vselesse made, By forward and affectate violence. He that spends his fury, and his strength I'th' first charge, must not hope to make's retreate, So nobly, as the modest Combatant, Whose onset slowly mooues: as carefull not T'outride his skill. Their vallour is t'attempt, Not to performe. T'is a giddy Nation; And neuer serious but in trifles. Duke. Thou doest mistake in naturall effects, Where Fancy is so rich, the incident To some mis-expence. These witty ryots Divulge the wealth o'th' Braine. Fruite that is ripe Is prone to fall, or to corrupt it selfe. According to the age of Monarchies: They now are fully ripe: they reach The height, and top of mortall faculties. Nature in them doth stand vpon the verge Of her owne youth. The English want Three hundred yeeres of that perfection. And as the Moone ner'e changes but i'th' full Euen so the mighty Nations of the Earth, Change in their greatest glory. First their strict And rugged discipline, to vaine delights. Their solemne Marches next to wanton Iigs. Their Battailes fierce to Duells spleenatiue, enter Lucio. kneeles. Or witty quarrels of the Penne. Luc. Heere may my knees take root: whilst I doe grow A liuing Statue of true obedience, Or let my royall Master grant his pardon. Duke. Sure we may trust, the iudgement of our eies, Thou dost not looke as if thou could'st commit A sinne so horrid, so vgly as can fright Our mercy from vs. Rise, we pardon thee. Now let vs know thy crime. Lucio. It is no crime Vnlesse against that great prerogatiue Youre eare hath ouerrune. Perhaps my Heart, Hath made escape through these fonde Eies. And I (I'th' rash discretion of my youthfull blood) Confin'd my selfe in Matrimoniall bonds. Duke. Hah! maried? speake suddenly, to whom? Fores. To my Sister. Sir pardon the permission, Foreste kneeles. Or frowne, and leaue your creature more obscure Then when you own'd him first. Now is the time To shew your charity Diuine. Preserue What you haue made. Duke. Foreste this is ill. What confederate with vngouern'd youth? But rise, we pardon you. Where's the Lady? Enter Corsa. Rare beauty!â You haue our pardon, and our fauour too. I thus inuite more knowledge of your worth Beleeue me Lady: you haue a feature That would betray a more experienc'd Eie Then Lucio's is. Excellent wretch! with a Timerous modesty, she stifleth vp Her vtterance. O such a pregnant Eye! And yet so slow of speech; is a wonder More delightfull, then any Nature makes. Hast thou Lucio, so much vnhappy witt, As to be iealous yet? wilt thou suppose Thy selfe secure in our discourse? Lucio. Heauen forbid, your Grace should er'e imploy Your time so ill as to discourse with her 'Till I grew jealous. Duke. Come hither Lady, come, confesse, how chance You haue bewitch'd my Boy with subtill smiles, With wanton hauiour of those pretty Eies? Doth Heauen bestow such Noble ornaments, To be abused in the vse: and now He is your Prisoner too, in cheerefull bonds, How can you haue the heart to make such spoile, And hauock of his beauty? hah! speake Lady! Corsa. I hope your Grace hath thoughts more mercifull I know this match was made in Heauen; and not Prouok'd by any sinfull art in me. How I haue vs'd him in this little time That he hath bin my Lord: let him declare. My duty is so strict, I need not blush To heare the story told. Duke. No! looke, looke there. His Eies for very shame Their luster's lost are crep't into his head: Encircled with the weakely cullor blew. The Roses in his Cheekes are withered quite His cleere and briske aspect is muddy now And dull: His voyce (that was so shrill; and could Euen Trumpet-like, outscolde the Ecchoe) Is hollow growne, and horce. Haue you then vs'd him well? Corsa. Alas (most gracious sir) goe not about To make my Lord suspect my Loyalty. If Nature sickne in his faculties; Which (heauen be thanked) I perceiued not yet, It cannot prooue a guiltinesse in me. Duke. Beleeu't (young wife) I am no Proselyte. I still auerr, you are that greedy Nimph, That hath deuour'd the rich complexion of my Boy. See how his feature's shrunke? his beauty stain'd? The Scythian Dame (whose cruelty is such, Whose lust so prodigall, that she doth striue To kill the able Lecher in the act; Making her wombe his Sepulchre) would yet Haue spard that wanton handsomenesse; to shew As patterne of her Lenitie. Corsa. I hope, your Grace will pardon Ignorance, That so ill mannerd is, as not to know Your meaning. Duke. No matter Lady. My accusation shall withdraw it selfe. Pretty innocence! Lucio, prepare. Tis our will to make thy Wife a Courtier; She shall be high in fauour; if she'll leaue Her modesty; that's out of fashion now: In Neighbor Courts, the Ladys so preuaile With masculine behauiour: they grow In factions able to depose their Husbands From the charter of their Sex. Fores. T'is strange that his dislike is fled so soone. Duke. Your Mariage we wil solemnize with masques, And Reuels. If Inuention euer meane, To get reward for subtiltie; tis now. We take notice (Lucio) She is thy wife, And thy sister our Foreste. Fores., Lucio. We your Graces humblest Creatures. Fores. Affection is become a Parasite; Striues to please, whom it cannot benifit.

Who ne're saw verse, but what their Sutors writ, Which they read like Prose too. Cast. I'le not discredit my patience, talke on. Dor. They say you are particular with a Great Lady. Cos. Yes, and her Pensioner. Dor. Some loose thing (belike) yet will be at charge, To secure her fame from noyse. For thou prayst Against all lechery but thine owne. Cos. And she hath wish'd in witty-penitence, Thou had'st beene single in the world. Dor. I, for then she had liu'd chaste. He growes angry, His eies looke red. Cast. No Sir. They blush to see a Foole. Dor. T'were fit they would imploy their modesty At home. For thou art a foole in print. Cos. Yet had he liu'd, when the old Sybill, Presented her diuine Manuscripts, to The dull Romane; he would haue scolded with her, Vnlesse his Pamphlets had attain'd the first Acceptance. Dor. True, for euery Poet thinks himselfe The best Poet in the world. Cos. And that Satyr not the worst; wherin He chides Women, for wearing their Halfe-Ruffes, Which pinn'd behin'd transascetuates the face, Or makes 'em looke, like Ianus with two faces. Dorid. A iust exception; for going hastily To kisse his whore; he could not find her Mouth. Cos. Why sure her breath was strong enough To direct him to it. Cast. Yet I haue heard nothing, but what deserues More pitty, then anger. Dorid. Now when he hath prouided some high toy For the Presse; he thinks on dedication, Strait chooseth one of the faction; who must Not Patronize, but buy what he makes vendable, With praise in the Epistle. Cos. Can you deny this Cousen Satyrist? Dorid. And nothing makes Learning so cheape; but that Euery writer sells his works. Exit Castruchio. they after him. Cos. Nay let's follow; and worry him to peeces. Enter Lucio, and Foreste. Lucio. Foreste! Our ruine is contriu'd aboue, If our Master prooue vnkin'd, the Planets Gouerne ill: For our gratitude, and care, Deserues more constancy. Foreste. Lookes he so strangely on yee? Lucio. As if the obiect were but new to him. And his owne heart vnsetled in his breast. Fores. Is his violence so soone tir'd suruay The Register of your owne deeds. Speake Sir, Haue you so engross'd his eares, as if their Organ, were yours, not his. Confin'd 'em to Your owne tongue: and so depriu'd the sorrowfull, The grieu'd in heart, of an easie audience? Lucio. Neuer. Forest. Since you haue shar'd the Dukes prerogatiue, And by his loue, held opposition, At such great aduantage, did you e're slight With cheape regard, those of high, and Noble birth? Lucio. My soule abhorrs such tyranny. Fores. Haue those who weare th'Eternalls Liuery Bought their wages of ye? Or haue they found Bold, and skilfull flattery, more helps Aduancement; then deepe and modest Learning? Lucio. Neuer, since my distinction was of power To helpe its choyce. Forest. In nice triall, or euidence of Law, Hath Custome (which only giues vs hope Of certainty in Iustice) bin traduc'd By your obscure helpe? Lucio. Neuer. Fores. Hath the desolate Widdow fear'd mercy From your eies, with her old ruin'd beauty, (For griefe was neuer amorous) or hath The torne Begget too soone dismissed your charitie Because not giddy enough to delight Wantonesse. Lucio. Neuer. Fores. Then if our great Master withdraw his loue; The weight of sufferance cannot bruise ye; For the whole world will share i'th' burden. Enter a young Gentleman with a Letter. Lucio. From whom is this sir? Gent. From my Lord Marquise de Loretta. Lucio. I humbly kisse his hand. Gent. Now luck flatter me but once, and I am madeâ Tis short, pray heauen it be sweete, or I'le nere loue The Prouerb. Lucio. Sir, haue you euer bin in seruice, Vnder any eminent Commander? Gent. Neuer yet. Lucio. Reade these Foreste. How Reputation lessens in esteme. Courtesie growes so cheape that deniall, Seemes lesse troublesome then consent. And performance is only Lazy. The labor of subscription hinders more, Then thought of that, to which it doth subscribe. This Letter would faine make you a Captaine In the new Troupes, sent to the Valtaline. But sure your modesty will teach you baulke The graunt, though I should beg ye to receau't. Fores. Sir. Shall the grey head, the old Souldier, That tries misfortune by his constancy In sufferance; affronts the winters rage; Whilst his blood is frozen into Corrall, His sinnes into Wyer: whose Vallor thinkes To weare Chain'd shot as bracelets on his Loynes. Shall his preferment be intercepted? Shall he now traile a Pike vnder a Boy, Whose experience is younger then his face? Lucio. No, the friendship of the noble Marquisse Shall neuer countenance vniust deeds. Finde a Sute more capable of my grant, And your acceptance, it is your owne. Chaire at the Arras. Gent. Noble Signior, I'le put ye to the test. Fores. Princes letters are cheaper far then those Which Scriueners put to sale. If such Pigmyes, Apes in doublets, procure command o'th' Campe, Let the Cranes wage war agen. No opposition Is too weake to ruinate.âGoe young Lord, The Duke is ill accompany'd, if only With his owne thoughts. Discouer more. Perhaps His discontent concerns not you. Lucio. I feare, yet my hopes would faine comfort me, Farewell. Exeunt omnes. Enter Luinna, and Duarte. Luin. I would not be vnmannerly, but if She be at leasure, tell her, I am heere. Dua. Please your Ladyship to sit, Il'e tell her so. enter Corsa. She's come already. Corsa. I saw your entrance. How doe you Sister? Luin. I humbly thanke your honor, I am well, Pray dismisse your woman: I would impart A priuacy. Corsa. Watch my Lords comming from the Duke, and bring Me word, before he is vncoach'd. Dua. I shall. Exit Duarte. Luin. O Madam Time is now growne old, and runnes But slowly, I thought each Hower, a yeere, Vntill I saw your Ladyship. Cor. Why what's the matter? I hope my brother's well Luin. Yes, I thanke heauen. But pray come hither Who doe you suppose was with me last night, When my husband was at Court? Corsa. How should I tell, without you instruct me. Luin. Why giue a guesse. Corsa. The Lady Benuolia, or the Lady Vtruvia, who was it? Luin. Nay t'was a Man too. Corsa. That's fine i'faith, pray name him to me. Luin. What thinke you of the best man in Sienna? Corsa. How! was the Duke with ye? Luin. Yes, disguis'd too: he either came, (or else Pretended so) to meete your husband there. After some talke, (in which he did expresse His loue to all our family) he gaue An ample praise of you: and sayd he saw Already so much worth in your faire breast As will adde a knot to your Lords Heart, And his owne: nay and make his constant loue A patterne for euery royall Master. Corsa. Indeed, I dayly pray to haue it so. Luin. Then he gaue me this same Iewell; to you He recommended the receipt of this. Corsa. Trust me wench, they are both full of glory Rarely cut, and set. Luin. Your's is the better of the twaine, Corsa. It is. But truely I mislike the manner of The gift. Dost thou thinke his thoughts are honorable? I prethee tell me? Luin. Th'are such as I suspected at the first, Such as made me to refuse these Iewels. He swore I was a Traytor, if I thought He meant amisse. Or if I did deny To beare this same to you, I did but ill Require his kind request vnto my husband. Then in the close he vsd such Art, such subtill phrase, To free his thoughts from the strict iealousie Of mine; as reconcil'd me to obey his will. You know besides how harsh it is to chide With Maiestie, or slight Princes fauors. Corsa. I'le shew it to my Lord. Luin. I had thought t'haue shewne my husband mine too But since t'is capable of curious Questioning, I meane to stay awhile. Corsa. Thou counsayl'st well. Wee'll weare 'em both at once. Mine is the best, I e're was Mistresse of. Enter Duarte. Luin. And mine is not ecclipsed much by yours. Dua. Madam, my Lord is neere at hand. Corsa. Come Sister, we shall heere the newes at Court. Luin. I'le waite vpon your Ladyship. Exeunt omnes. Enter Castruchio, Lothario, Borachio. Cast. Sir Knight, beleeu't Foreste is the Man; That duls your reputation with the Duke, And subbornes the Count against ye. Loth. Dares he controle my purposes? Cast. Aske honest Borachio else. Bora. Nay He'le not beleeue me: though I should swear You flout him behind his backe: and when a man Sees things plainely; he neede not buy spectacles, Till he grow old. Loth. I'le mince the Villaine into sand, to fill My Howerglasseâ Cast. In this Garden he walkes continually After dinner. Heere stay, and expect him. And Signior in this skin of parchment; marke What paines I take, to prefect your reuenge. I'th' shape of a tree (which takes roote in Hell) You shall discouer all his base discent. On that branch appeares a Hangman. Then, A lakes-man, then, a Tynker. On's Mothers side A Bawde profess'd. then, a Tybb. then, a Trypewife. A Synagogue of Welsh Rabbys; could not Expresse more skill in Genealogies, Then this includes. Sir, shew it him, and he Insaniates strait. Loth. I'le make him weare it on his forehead. Cast. Excellent rage! but not a word of me. I humbly take my leaue. exit Castruchio. Loth. Not the foure winds (met in March) shall coole my spleene Bora. Sir, now we are priuat, tis a fit time To be troublesomeâ Loth. I'le cram Cerberus, with sopps made of the slaues bloodâ Bora. Concerning those Offices. I'ue thought on 'em, And will haue 'em all in spight of Boltens teeth. ent. For. Fores. Signior Lothario! Borachio too. Thou art an honest fellow. Bora.

Behold, &amp; grow more mannerly. shewes him a Parchment. Fores. Whats heere? My Pedigree? Some sawcy knaue Hath counsell'd him, to this affront. What he, Enter seruants. I must know th'originall proiector. Lay hold vpon those fooles. Loth. Lay hold on me? Take off your hands; or I will tosse ye all Into the cloudes, and kicke the Mountaines after ye. Bora. I pray bid the Gentleman take good heede; For my Master, can doe all this, and more too I haue seene him. Ser. Be you quiet. You that desire Offices. Bora. If I doe, what then? there be those desire Worse things. Loth. Know ye not Rogues, that I can muzle vp The testie Vnicorne, in a Spinners threed? Fores. Lay all hold on him. Bora. He that cannot runne for his Liberty Hath no courage in his Heeles. Let the Goute Take him, that hath Leggs, and w'ont vse'em he runs away. Fores. No matter, let him goe. Conuey that foole, Vnto the Porters Lodge. Loth. A Chaos shall succeed this same. Exeunt seruants with Lothario. Enter Lucio. Foreste. Whither so fast (sweete Lord!) Lucio. Foreste, I haue tane my leaue o'th' Duke. Fores. Must ye away to night. Lucio. Now, presently. My followers attend At doore. I onely came to kisse thy hands. Fores. The Sunne will faile yee, ere ye reach Lucca. Lucio. I must through. His grace will haue it so. Why dost thou make thy head, to shake and reele, Vpon thy shoulders thus. Is it o'recome With thoughts, and such as must be hid from me? Fores. Take heede, suspition is the Fauorite Of Time, and Nature, it takes a sudden grouth: And gathers in the brest, like Balls of snow, In snow; vntill the weight make it deny To be remoou'd: then melts at leasure too. Lucio. He's too moderate, that will at my yeeres, Be satisfied thus. Fores. Why then consider thus. You goe to Lucca, There to congratulate the safe aproach Of the Popes Legate; He hath bin there a weeke; And why he was not visited ere this Or why vpon such strict, and short summons. Your selfe must now be sent; quite puzles me. Actions rare, and sudden, doe commonly Proceed from fierce necessitie: or else From some oblique designe: which is asham'd, To shew it selfe i'th' publique Rode. Lucio. Foreste is this all? Forest. Why my sweete Patron: this is enough Of danger, since none is merited. Lucio. Yong thoughts encourage me to sufferance. Each storme is vsner to a gentle calme: Who toyles with speede, gets soonest home to rest. The plodding Muse shall sleepe eternally: Why should the stricken deare bemoane his death: His obsequies, were full of noble rites: Acteons Quire, a iolly Requiem gaue: And th'Arrow from the bow did sing his dirge. Fores. Thus thy yeeres doe riddle griefe away; Making sorrow swift, because 'tis mortall. Let me waite, on your Lordship to your horse, And at your better leasure read this same. I'le tell ye as we goe, who brought it me. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Duke. Duke. To wrong my boy, vnkinde, incestuous heate! Why is Copulation legal; it giues Authoritie to lust, for chastetie Would soone conclude the World. O virtuous Preiudice, when error, preuents folly! Fiendes, Deuils, that doe liue in liquid fire, Haue constitutions not halfe so hot, So riotous as mine. But why this? The beautious Corsa is not yet defil'd. He that repents e're he commits a fault, Doth like a thirsty, sinner store his Soule With mercy, to absolue that sinne himselfe; Which he may afterwards, more securely Fall into. Enough this soone Initiates. Enter Castruchio. The credulous Count her husband, I haue sent To Lucca. And to morrow he returnes. My plots are limmited too short a time To become Actions. Nor was it skill To send the Iewell by her sister. Marke! My Soule and braine, are perfect Courtiers growne; In my declention, and my greatest want They leaue me to instruct, and helpe my selfe. Cast. These fancies are not old: the whole Court Obserues him strangely altered. But why Am I sent for? that I must know, by safe, And cautelous insinuation. Duke. How soone, I'ue profited in discipline Of Hell. I must through. What I did meane Adultery at first; will now I feare Become a Rape. Cast. Hah! still vpon that string? I like it well, T'is musicall. Duke. Castrucho! art thou come? Thou hast bin a Courtier long; but whether 'Twas want of skill in me to choose a Man, Or want of lucke in thee to be my choyce; Suspence makes neutrall. But know; my loue Was tardy, because still voyde of leasure; To warrant passion well bestowed; by safe (Though tedious) trials. Affection That is slow, is sure: And now, I weare my heart Not in mine owne breast, but thine. Cast. I haue but one life, it is some error In your Grace, thus t'oblige me to the losse Of more, in your deare seruice. Duke. I am not skil'd in words. But I affect Thy fury. For thou art the bold Satyr, That whips Foreste, and the wanton Count, In thy tart Verse. Cast. My gracious Lord! I shall conceiue much griefe If my zeale mistake in accusation Of those Men, which th'vncertaine Tongue of Fame Deliuers to my charge. Duke. Nay, make not thy confession an excuse Rather then a story: For there needs none. I hate Foreste, and the Count, and would Deuise succinct ways to my reuenge. Cast. Heauen forbid! I'de rather farre disgrace The skill of my subiect; call accusation Slander: then that the busie multitude Should note inconstancy in you, Duke. This is a damn'd Hypocrite. Chamelions Changes, are not so intricate to sense. Castruchio! ease me with nimble apprehension. I haue not leasure, to be modest now. Speake; hast no acquaintance with any neere Cersa's person; the Counts faire wife? Cast. I humbly beg, your Grace would not mistake The conditions of my duty. Duke. I beg of thee not to mistake the sense Of my designes: My words import my heart, And both, no danger vnto thee. Cast. I hope my skill in seruitude, will not Prouoke my Prince to tempt my honor. Duke. What prolixe loue is this; Dost thou indent With my acceptance, make choyce of seruices! Cast. Your Grace will giue me leaue; since that I know I not deserue to share in your high secrets, To doubt my safety in knowing this. Duke. Death! and horror! thy suspitions are too thinne. Consider why I sent the Count to Lucca? Vpon my life thou art secure: therefore Reply vnto my former question. Cast. My gracious Lord, I haue some interest In her woman. Duke. Is Corsa's woman knowne to thee? Cast. She is. Perhapsâ Duke. Discharge thy tongue. May my eares blister If they digest words to thy preiudice. Cast. Perhaps I knew her, beyond the modest straine. Duke. There's Gold. Castruchio, shew some pitty flings him a Bag. On rebellious blood. Be my Harbenger, Billet me this night where she doth lye And thou art made for euer. Cast. Must it be this night? Duke. Strict opportunitie will haue it so. Her Lord returnes with the next Sunne. Cast. I cannot say her selfe shall porter be Vnto your entrance; but her woman shall. Duke. Enough! there's more Gold. Summon vp thy braine Thy heart, thy soule, to meet in consultation, And so contriue my peace, Farewell. Cast. I will instruct your Grace e're long: both when, And how to make this amorous assault. Duke. My selfe and my Exchequer are thine owne. There needs no Art to worke him into euill; He is bad enough t'infect the Deuill. Exeunt seuerall wayes.</field>

Castruchio is grac'd with rare imployment: The Duke and he doe heere consume the Night. These are houres for Ghosts, Adulterers And Theeues. The slaue is Haggard. At Supper Being full of gold: his vaine Appetite Fed at Nero's rate; I was discarded With a frowne: shaken like a Burre from's sleeue. As if my closure heeretofore had bin Impertinent.

But what; she tooke it willingly! Dua. No, but she did not. Cast. Pox 'o these modest Lies! I say she did, Duar. In troth you doe abuse her then; I'm sure Her shreeks did scare my heart vp to my lipps. Cast. Then thou couldst haue Kiss'd heartely. Duar. I wonder, it wakened not the whole house. Cast. Ist possible! what meanes did the Duke vse To stifle vp this noyse? Dua. Nay, I know not. But since she was no more Pliant; it doth repent me much, I'ere Was instrument to his other actions. Cast. What, repent! I prethee sweete Duarte Wrong not Diuinitie so much: waste not A virtue, that would more profit others: And to suppose that the Lady was rauish'd, Is an heresie, which my Soule must nere Be guilty of. Doe not I know Women Are a kinde of soft waxe, that will receaue Any impression? Dua. And doe not I know: there is difference In workemen as in wax. Hard wax (when cold) Accepts of no impression. By coldnesse I inferre chastitie: for chastitie Is colde. Cast. But those workemen are harder farre Then that hard waxe. And t'is hardest of all To finde those workemen: vnlesse by Russia Where the people freeze, till they spit snow. Come, Kisse me Chuck. Agen, once moreâ Dor. A precious Satyrist! This surly Dog, Inueyes 'gainst lechery in others, 'cause He would engrosse all Women to himselfe. Cast. Your greatest Thieues, are commonly begot When Parents doe their leachery by stealth. Men get Cowards, when frighted in the Act. And by such vulgar consequence: 't'is now A proper time to beget a Pander. One, that may hereafter doe other men The same office: which we doe the Duke now. Come. Shall we in, and try? Dua. You presume much, on an easie nature; And how extrauagant you are abroad; I am not so vnkind to question. Cast.

His Hand Imployd a Torch, a Torch; whose fancy weake Aged, and blacke, had ouergrowen the flame. And shew'd (me thought) like vnto Tarquins Ghost; Preaching in fire: as if it counsell'd him, To preuent such pennance by forsaking His attempt. This, I told him too. But he (That came not to consider, but to act) O'rerul'd my Hands with his: then made shipwrack Of my Honor. Luin. O royall Villaine! My ioynts and sinnews dissipated are, And scatter'd in a trembling feare. But marke More sorrowes yet. My Husband lookeing in My Cabinet, did spy that Iewell there, Which the Duke last gaue me. It was to him A new, and vnknowne starre: and Commet like, Imployd his thoughts with such Astrologie As made an Optick of his iealousie; Through which, he would discerne the cause, th'effect Of its being there. I told him all the truth: And Truth's oftner praysed, then rewarded Heere on Earth: for he dismiss'd me streight With fatall lookes. Corsa. My Brother is a noble Gentleman. Goe, goe, and kneele to him. All iealousie Must still be strangled in its birth: or Time Will soone conspire to make it strong enough To ouercome the truth. Shield vs sweete Heauen!

Allas I'm apt to weepe, though I but see An Onyon stripp'd naked. Cast. I thought to meete thy Master heere. I'm sure I saw the warrant sign'd for his release. Bora. The Deuill take your worship for me, why, D'yee bring such good newes, on a work'y day? Cast. But thou pray'st ill, in praying the Deuill To take me. Bora. Why could he euer come to lesse purpose Then when he findes you doing well. Though he Loose his labour once: I dare warrant ye, He'le come againe on the same arrand. Cast. A bitter foole. Bora. Sir, let we friends be true to one another. There are but few true friends extant. Let them Be kindly vs'd and kept, if only for breed. Cast. With all my heart, translate thy meaning. Bora. Is my Master at liberty? Cast. I'le deferre an answere of this, vntill Thy owne Eies be a little elder. Bora. Well, is he still in fauour with the Duke? Cast. Why he shall shortly gouerne all at Court, And be a very Mote in the Duk's eye. Bora. Enough. T'is not wholesome to burst with Ioy. Cast. But what then? Bora. I'ue thought with much care on these Offices: And finde my selfe fitting to be in'em. I will haue'em all; come Cut, and Long-taile. For my Wife, will be such a glad woman. Enter Lothario. Cos. Looke! who comes there? Bora. O Sir! giue me your blessingâ He kneeles. Loth. Weepe not Borachio!

Signior, I knew ye a braue Commander Vnder the great Petruchio; and since That time your constant virtues haue deseru'd More recompence, then Fate will minister By me. My kindenesse is no miracle: Since gratitude is only sicke, not dead. But pray beleeue what I haue sayd is truth. Fores. O Sir, t'is th'error of vnskilfull loue To be too constant in her charitie To all. But I haue grounds more relatiue To make me iealouse of the truth: and I Beleeue you with my heart: and yet t'is strange. Doth this Castruchio thinke his haggard fate Can triumph ouer mine? because in lust The Deuill did instruct his industry: Dares he attempt my life? Dor. I giue you reall grounds for my suspence. Reward (sir) may make a Villaine bloody Though it cannot make him valiant. The Duke Will let him want no Gold. Fores. Nay t'is often seene. Amongst the seuerall Creatures of a Prince, Such instruments as these most profit reape. Imployments noble doe requite themselues, And honour payes, the great of heart: who loose But Time in seruice which is the Bodies wealth. Your friend stays.

Come hither Loue. Signefie in secret When was the royall Lecher heere disguis'd? What did he send thee last? when must ye quench The Cyprian fire: hah! you may tell me all, For I'le not blabb. Alas, I'm more silent Then my Grandsire in his Tombe. A subtill Pimpe, I. A Pander learned in the art. Tell me Chucke? Luin. Alas my noble Lord! what doe ye meane? Fores. Why nothing, I: yet tis enough I feele The wrong. If ignorant, I suffer twice. And therefore let me know my Enemy. The little worme, when trod vpon; will turne His Head, to looke vpon his Murderer.

Or bring the riotous Horse, and the Towne Bull To drownd ye in the act. Take her aside, And agree who shall beginne. Luin. Stay, stay, O my Husband, my deerest Lord? Will you permit such cruelty against Your owne Wife. She, that hath so often slept Within your Bosome. O speake? doe you want The naturall touch! stay, stay, I will confes't. Forest. Stay, I'm of too easie, too soft a Soule. My Heartstrings (sure) are made of silke: and 'tis A subtill whore, she knowes it well enough. But come, be briefe. Charme me not with storys Of my former loue betweene vs. I see thee as thou art, and thou appear'st Like an intire, proportionable Boyle. Why speak'st thou not? Luin. Sorrow was euer slow of vtterance, And I doe tremble still. I knew the time, My duty hath bin held in more regard Then now it is. All former interest Is quit forgot. Fores. Marke, did not I suspect, she would begin Her Charmes agen. Away with her. Luin. O stay, now, now, I will reueale all. Fores. Be nimble then: and tell me punctuall truth, For my reuenge is honest, and would not Willingly mistake, when it shall strike. Luin. T'is true, your Sster's rauish'd by the Duke. Which fatall truth, this morning I receau'd From her owne mouth, But if I ere did breake My Mariage vowes, or thinke vnlawfully; Then may I loose my interest in Heauen. My duty, and my loue remaine still yours, And this constancy deserues some kindnesse. Therefore, if t'is decreed that I must dye: Let me dye a modest death. Expose not Your poore vvife, vnto the cruelty Of Rauishers. Fores. What thinke ye sir? Dor. My thoughts continue in the former sence: I haue a chaste, and virtuous wife; howeuer You desir'd assurance from a triall So vnkind as this. Fores. Still me thinks that Iewell which he gaue her, Procur'd the same requitall that my Sister made. But let it passe. I doe coniure ye both, (As y'haue bin Souldiers) to keepe your Tongues, A safe distance from your Eares, Let not words Disperse what you haue heard. T'is externall Reputation that keepes some Men from sinne. Our faults once knowne, we doe neglect to mend: Since Reputation suffers still: for that Admits of helpe, but it is neuer cur'd. And so the fatall iarrs tweene Man, and Wife, If secret kept, dissension falls asleepe. But if once knowne to Fame; Fame talks so loude She waketh it agen. Your silence Signiors, Shall challenge much from my requitall. Dor. Besides our obligations to your worth, Euen both our honors would impose it As a virtue, not a trouble. We are Your humble seruants. Exit Dorido with his Friend. Fores. I will deserue you for my friends.

Though I were stomach'd like an Estridge, Yet could I not digest such hard dealing. My Wife defil'd, Corsa rauish'd. The Count Abus'd where satisfaction is exempt By Nature. My selfe proscrib'd to suffer By the cheape vallour of obscure Villaines. Would I had trode the humble path, and made My industry lesse ambitious. The Shrub Securelie growes. The tallest Tree, stands Most in the winde. And thus we distinguish The Noble from the base: the Noble finde Their liues, and deaths still troublesome: But humility doth sleepe, whilst the storme Growes horce with scolding.

Can you Suruiue a wrong so eminent: a wrong Committed 'gainst your Husband, and my Patron? Corsa. O Sir! I hope if you haue heard the trueth: You will conclude it as a rape i'th' Duke; And no adultery in me. Fores. How, a rape! o weake, and immodest shift, Were Aretine aliue; or had I brought A Crew of Midwiues heere: whose obscene art Might warrant the distinction good; Although the cause did blush, to owne th'effect; Yet thy appeale might stand: but heere are none.

O this Wilde mysterie so much concerneth Man: That we would willingly dismisse suspence With Eiesight not with consequence. For he that sees through Faith, but flatters doubt. Faith's a Perspectiue; through whose narrow lane; Little things (far of) seeme so much too great, Too neere: that what was first vnknowne is more Estrang'd from knowledge, then it was before. Yet by the rules of lawfull notion: It Goes well with her: for she was euer giuen To prayer: superstitious in humilitie: And euen vnthrifty in her charitie.

Doth she insist in censure of the act With such a sterne impatience, and dislike? Cast. Euen so (Sir) my intelligence imports.

Hee'le choose To trauaile in the Night for priuacie. Duke. And I haue sent to stay him there: vntill A new Commission order his returne. Cast. Most royall Sir, you then may guesse what frights Such opposition in these messages Will nourish in his Heart. And being yong, He cannot feede on doubts. Hee'le rather thinke His interest in you his preuiledge to erre: So, slight your Mandate, and come home, To settle his suspence. Duke. Remorse doth cherish danger! Let me be safe.

And finding you betray'd in your owne Fort! I slit her Wrist-vaynes, and gaue perpetuall Liberty, to her polluted Blood. Lucio.

I wonder Heauen takes so little Notice of it. I am not sindg'd to death With Lightning Like the Dorr: nor murdred through The Eare with thunder; like a Batt. O Lucio! Minde not my former loue: but strike, vntill I groane my last. Lucio. Foreste sheath thy sword. It must not be. He was our Royall Master once, and might In modesty compare himselfe; with all Best Princes; whom Fame reserues as Paternes. For my sake sheath your Sword. Duke. O I shall suruiue my Royall Charter! My creature is more beautifull then I: More wealthy in his loue. Fores. For my owne part, I will annihilate My selfe: for should I liue, I should grow madde. But I am bound to care for you (my Lord) Take heede! I know the tricks of Maiestie. They thinke they cannot be secure after Doing ill; but by doing worse: that is, By killing quite whom erst they did but wound. Lucio. And that's the surgery, which I desire, I will endure all. O my Lord, my Lord; I will not bid Posterity tell tales: not charge Historians to insert in Annalls; On such a Night a great Italian-Duke, Rauish'd his Creature Lucio's Wife: Sister To Foreste, his actiue Councellor. Fores. Lucio, compos'd of such an humble loue: That to secure his Masters feete, would spread, And scatter all his Limmes, for him to walke vpon. Lucio. And Foreste, whose industry, and care Outwatch'd Leane-vigilance, 'till she grew mad. But come, Let's leaue him to contriue our deaths. My Heart so fills my mouth, I cannot speake. Duke. Lucio stay, Foreste stay awhile. Leaue me not thus anatomiz'd with breath. He riseth from the Bed. Dissect me really with your good Swords. Behold my Breast, take out my Heart: and if You finde your figures there, then vse my Fame With Mercy. Lucio. Foreste come away. Fores. Make hast Luinna. Luin. I am wak'd out of a strange amazement. Exeunt Foreste, Lucio, Luinna. Duke. Hide me swelling Hills! rough, and scabbed Rocks, Ye Quarries cleaue, and sucke me in, then ioyne Againe. Would it not make a Patriarke mad? O who shall bribe the Sunne, that in the day Of generall accompts: he may auouch He neuer saw me heere. Hah! false Memory! I forgot to tell 'em of Castruchio. Tis best to o'retake 'em. I cannot guesse Which way they went: Exit the other way. Enter Castruchio, Lothario, Cosimo. Cast. Hell, and the Pillary take such dull Eares. It cannot be, but they haue pass'd the Cloysters, And e're this, with helpe of priuate Keyes, Entred the Dukes Bedchamber. Loth. Those were Authors of that noyse, I spoke of. Cast. The very same. A pox vpon demurres. Cos. Will you lead the way, that we may hearken enter Duke. If they be there, or no. Duke. If I should come too late?â Loth. That's none of the Counts voyce. Haue at ye sir. Duke. O, O, O, I am surpriz'd in my owne snare. Cast. It is Foreste sure. Let's make safe worke Kill Lothario, lay him by him, and depart. Cos. A match. Loth. O Villaines, O, O, O. Lothario dies. Enter Foreste, Lucio, Luinna. Fores. What noyse is that? Cast. Another Foreste. Lucio. My Royal Master bleeding on the Ground. O murderous Villaines: Luin. Murder, murder. Helpe! oh helpe! Exit Lucio fights with Cossimo, Foreste with Castruchio. Fores. The Duke my Soueraign, slaine, and Lucio Bleeding at his feete. Villaine take this thrust At my owne preiudice. Lucio. I am foyld by a base hand. Cast. Flie Cosimo, flie. Exeunt Cast. and Cos. Fores. Some comfort yet remaines: in that I am, Proscrib'd to share in thy fate, though it be bad. I loose much blood. O triuiall fortitude, False Sinnewes, doe you begin to shrinke? He fals downe. Duke. Lucio, Let my Soule cary your pardon With her vnto Heauen; and yours Foreste. This stratageme was mine, but the successe, Was much against my will. Lucio. Sir, I forgiue you all. Fores. Nay let vs ioyne Hands.âWe doe forgiue Each other, and the World. The like mercy May Heauen bestow on vs. Duke. Amen, Amen. Lucio. Amen, Amen. they die. Fores. There his heartstrings broke. Lucio (my Patron) Already Chapfalne to: that sight deserues a Teare: Though I should stabb my Eies to warrant it. Enter Dorido, Luinna, Courtiers with Light: Castruchio: and Cosimo: led in. Dor. Bring the slaues in, their deeds will soone conuince Their faint deniall, where did you leaue 'em Lady? Luin. Here, here, O my Lord, my Lord. Fores. I haue not breath enough to comfort thee. With words, mercy Heauen. dies. Luin. O my Lord? my Husband. He's dead, he's dead. Dor. Hold the Lady there: O dire spectacle. the Duke, Lucio, Foreste, and Lothario Lye here breathlesse. I did suspect some blacke Conspiracy. Which made me haunt them two Vnto the Pallace, but I did loose 'em By the Chappell staires; bloody dogs, what Deuill Prompted thee to this action. Cast. I hope, I'ue not so much Blood left, as will preserue Me for an answeere. Cos. I feele my end to neere. Dor. Take em away, and close their wounds, though there Be some mercy shewne, by thus deferring That reward which your blacke soules shall receaue In Hell. Yet know the Law will heere on Earth Prouide such tortures as shall make your deaths Exemplary to all succeeding times.â exeunt some with Cast. and Cos. Gentlemen, your silence may be excus'd. Where, theres so much cause of admiration. Some helpe transfer the dead from hence, others Call vp the Councellors of state. So intricate is Heauens reuenge gainst lust. The righteous suffer here, with the vniust. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
