      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Grounds in front of Revesdale Castle. The front of the Castle occupies the back of the stage. Richard Frampton discovered, leaning thoughtfully on a gun. Giles and group of Peasants and Retainers of Lord Revesdale rush on and surround Richard. Peas. Here's Master Frampton! Retain. Master Richard Frampton! He'll tell us all. Enter Alice. Alice. What, Richard! my son, Richard! [She makes her way through the group to Frampton. Rich. So, so, mother! Alice. It can't be trueâI won't believe 'tis true; My young lord sell his landsâsell Revesdale Park! Giles. The castle, tooâold almost as the earth On which it stands, and which, since it has stood, Never owned man for master but a Revesdale! Rich. Ay, lands and castle, all must go! Alice. Why must? Rich. Because the king won't pay his debtsâvast sums By our late master, brave Lord Godfrey, raised To help the first King Charles, who perished, leaving The claim uncancelled. Then came the second Charles, Who put Lord Godfrey off with promised payment, Till in one month both prince and subject died. King James, his brother's heir, sat on his throne; My master's heir was beggared! Giles. But King James Will give my lord his rights? Rich. King James but chid him For thrusting in his need 'midst public cares; So sent him with his sister home to ruin. Giles. Our young Lord Basilâopen hand that ne'er Forgot the poor! Alice. Ay, sirs, and his sweet sister, Lady Felicia, whom but to look on Were cure for evil! Giles. Talking of evil, look! [Points off. Rich. His worship, Master Bancroft! 'Tis his cousin, Living abroad, to whom my lord's estate Stands pledged, to satisfy whose strict demand It must be sold; so wills our magistrate. Giles. Magistrate, 'sooth! 'Twas more brute's deed than man's To hunt to death by scores, as Bancroft did, The poor mistaken souls who rose with Monmouth. Alice. So said my lord and young Squire Ringwood. Giles. All To gain promotion! Magistrate, indeed! Bloodhound! Rich. Hush, hush! he's here. Giles and Peas. Who cares? Enter Bancroft. All shrink back except Richard. Ban. Well, friend, can I see your master? [Richard, who polishes his gun-stock vigorously, makes no reply.] D'ye hear? Your master, knave, I say! [Advancing to him.] Have you no answer? Rich. Oh, it's to me you speak? Ban. You knew it! Rich. No; You called me friend, which I am not; then knave, Which I am not, not being your worship's friend. My master's in discourse; if you would see him, You can wait his leisure, or return. [A murmur of approbation from the group.] To your tasks! Alice. We'll bear your love and duty to my lady. [Peasants and Retainers go out; then Alice, Richard, and Giles. Ban. Bloodhound! My zeal that brought the rogues to justice, Who leagued with Monmouth's duke against King James, Has won me this new christening. Arthur Ringwood! You taught the mob to hate meâtaught this proud And ruined lord, who now lies in my powerâ Thanks to my cousin's mortgageâthus to brand me. Shall I forget how at a public feast, Laying, in talk, my hand upon his arm, Roughly the youngster shook me off? Said he, âI like not, sir, to bear the soil of dust Upon my coat, far less the soil of blood!â Shall I forget how all men at those words Shrank from me as contagion? how my equals Have shunned me sinceâa man proscribed and shunnedâ A social leper? 'Tis his new command In the militia that still foils my plans. He little deems the appointment was but given, That, should his schemes be treasonous, they might The better be observed, and he entrapped. Bloodhound! I'll earn my nameâswift, keen, untiring! Though, from loose gossip, I suspect young Ringwood Shared Monmouth's treason, was in arms for him, And that Lord Revesdale knows it. [Looking off.] Ah, 'tis Ringwood And the pet fawn of the park, Felicia Revesdale! 'Slife! his arm's free with her! The hound's in ambush. [He retires through the door of Castle, and stands concealed. Enter Matthew Ringwood, followed by Arthur Ringwood and Felicia Revesdale. Mat. [Laughing to himself.] And she answered yes, so soon! Ha, ha! that boy Has the world at his fingers' ends! To fight or argue, Discuss affairs of state, or win a womanâ All's the same to him. [To Arthur.] Pooh, sir! she repents, And droops her head. Arth. You broke so suddenly Upon our conferenceâ Mat. O, conference! What two young hearts, masking for years with friendship, Can't fling aside their vizards, and display The honest love behind them, but it needs A conference, does it? Arth. 'Twas her very friendship, Frank, like a sister's, made me doubt till now Love's deeper spring beneath. Mat. And what says the daughter Of those grim Normans to the rich brewer's grandson? Fel. That when she looks on him, she has no thought To spare for grandsires. Mat. Tut! How this news Will surprise Basil! Arth. Yes; his recent absence, And his reserve since then, have kept my hopes Strange to him yet. Fel. Reserve! Arth. When late deposed From his colonelcy in the militia, I stepped into his post; 'tis this, I fear, Rankles his pride, which deems I built advancement On his disgrace. Mat. Yet you but took the office To curb the cruel licence of the soldiers, Prompted by Bancroft. Arth. I had said as much; But Basil would not hear me. Fel. Bear with him, My true, kind brother! By the king's injustice, Soon to be driven from home, forlorn and poor, Wrong makes him quick and proud. Arth. Have we forgot That to his generous silence and your shelter I owed my life? Mat. And you were strangers then. Alas! poor Monmouth and that fatal night! [In a low and cautious tone apart to him, and advancing to the front. Oft, Arthur, have I rued the chance that threw you, A peaceful subject, 'midst those hapless rebels! Arth. 'Twas, as you say, but chance. My horse's path They crossed, leagues from the field, poor fugitives, A score to one pursuer! A brace of troopers, Deaf to their cries, clove down those helpless wretches, Staggering, unarmed, and famished! What could man, Who had a heart and sword, do less than Iâ Parry the slaughterous blow, and give them time For flight and life? Mat. Ay, lad, till the king's men, Coming to their comrades' aid, forced you to fly For your own life. Well that you were disarmed And masked by twilight. Promise never more To tempt your fate so. Arth. [Gaily.] Sir, you'd bid me do it, Did the chance come round. [Felicia advancing, and laying her hand on his arm imploringly.] You too; you'd never ask That I should grow so niggard of my years As to keep down the impulse just or kind That gives time worth. You'd have me live, I know, Or long, or brief, a thinking, loving man; No torpid thing, that only measures time By the almanac. To feel, to act, is life; Who wants these lives not, sweet; he only breathes. Mat. Here's an oration! Well, 'twas worth the risk To hear the rogues tramp by, nor guess the traitor Lurked snugly by Felicia's loyal hearth. Fel. [Earnestly.] My brother knew not that. Arth. That you concealed me? On that point I was silent; 'twas your wish. But why? I met him with his retinue At the Castle gate, and told him all my plight. Fel. He must not know you passed within our doors. I kept the knowledge from him, that, if questioned, He might deny it truly. Mat. And so 'scape The peril you incurred! Oh, wise as noble, Thou'rt worthy of my boy! Arth. And now to Basil. Fel. He's held by strangers now. Mat. To-morrow, then. But mind you keep our secret, for I mean Myself to tell him. 'Twill be brave to thaw His pride in our warm love. Come, we'll all cheer him In his harsh lot, and henceforth have one interest, One home, one heartâperhaps one home indeed, For there's a grand investment, a rare toy, In stone that Arthur covetsâaâWell, well, I'll say no moreâa new surprise for Basil! You'll keep your word; remember, now, I tell him. [Matthew, Arthur, and Felicia go out. Re-enter Bancroft, from Castle. Ban. Plague on the distance and my own dull ears! I lost the most part; but my brain is pregnant With what did reach me. Sheltered from some risk! Sheltered by whom? Her brother? Shelter, risk, Basil was silent! Then the peril lay In what he knew and told not. So I thought. Young Ringwood was in arms for the Duke of Monmouth! This modest squire, too, wooes the fair Felicia, Which my lord knows not, for he stands aloof. That wound of the militia which I probed Will fester, though he hid the sore from me. To gender hate 'twixt the proud blood of Revesdale And base-born Ringwood I have striven, will strive; And from that hate perchance so work my ends As to sting both; win the king's gratitude To swell my lands, to lift me into rank. Sir RichardâBloodhound! Oh, I must walk to cool! [He goes out. SCENE II. A Gothic library in Revesdale Castle. The room, which is in some confusion, is hung with weapons, portraits, &amp;c. The arms of the Revesdale family are painted on a window, which is partly open, fronting the park. Antique couch at back. Writing table; on it pens, inkstand, parchments, and papers. Antique chairs. Lord Revesdale, Drayton, Miles, and Holme seated at table. Dray. What says your lordship? Reves. That had I remained In the militia, wherein, as you say, My friend displaced me, I had scorned to use The king's trust 'gainst himself. Dray. But the people love you. Lift but your hand, hundreds of stalwart yeomen Will leap to horse. Reves. I will not rashly peril Those honest, trusting hearts. As yet I know not Your plans, your strength, or your associates. Holme. You know King James a tyrant to his people, And your immediate ruin. Miles. What can bind you To him who has left you nothing but a name? Reves. My last possession! You'll forgive me, therefore, If I'm jealous how I risk it. [All rise. Miles. [Aside.] What a look! They're well called the proud Revesdales. Holme. To the point: Should William of Nassau set foot in England, Shall he have aid from you? Reves. I'll answer that When I've your scheme and know my comrades. Dray. Ere We name them, sign this document. [Taking parchment from his breast.] It prays Prince William's presence here, to arbitrate Between the king and his wronged subjects. Reves. [Perusing the paper.] But Exacts no pledge to arm in the quarrel? Dray. None. Reves. [Signing it.] 'Tis signed. [Returns it to Drayton. Dray. And here's the list of those who share our venture. [Gives it. Reves. Sir Dudley Ford, Lord Harwood, Langton, Orme. High names! Dray. Meet us an hour hence at my house, Where those in league assemble. Meantime learn We're bound by mutual peril. Your subscription Is treason, and incurs its sentenceâdeath! Reves. For this you bade me sign, to force my silence By the base means of fear. I sought to know By comrades, and I know them. There's your path. [Pointing to door. Dray. Not by that door, an't please you. We require The screen of the forest. For our late precaution, Remember danger brooks not ceremony. In an hour we shall expect you. Friends, to horse! [Drayton, Miles, and Holme go out by window. Reves. [Who paces the room, suddenly stopping short.] Pshaw, pshaw! Why should it fret me that base hirelings Ask pledges for my truth? 'Tis not with them I deal, but with their causeâa righteous protest Against this tyrant who treads down our laws, Breaks every kingly oath; in the Church's name Slays poor schismatics, while himself betrays The Church to Rome! My wronged and loyal house Falls from thee, James, in me! I'll join these men, And for more secrecy afoot. [He seizes his hat and cloak from chair. Enter Felicia. Reves. [With great tenderness.] Felicia! Fel. Do you go forth? Reves. Ay, love, on urgent matters. Fel. Urgent! And you've not told them to your sister? Reves. Since we were orphans, have I known a joy You knew not likewise? 'Tis my cares alone That would be secret. [Kissing her forehead, and crossing towards door. Fel. Stay, I've greetings for you From Master Ringwood. He would have you count His heart and home your own. Reves. [Bitterly.] Was Arthur by To confirm this bounty! [Aside.] He who flaunts in honours Stripped from his friend, and so lends countenance To the court's insult! Fel. Basil! Reves. Girl, that man Would rise upon our ruin! Fel. [Reproachfully.] Arthur Ringwood! Reves. [After a pause.] I may have been unjust. Fel. You were indeed. Then you'll accept their welcome; you will, Basil? Are you too proud? Reves. What shield has poverty But pride? In happier days you knew me free To all of worth, as liberal of kind thoughts As the day of light. My disk is darkened now! Let it die out, rather than glimmer on By the pensioned beams of others! Fel. Should you spurn Those aids from man to man, the loftiest need To lean on or they fall? Reves. The line of Revesdale May fall; it never leaned. Fel. Be not so lost In pining for past greatness, as to scorn Life's present blessings! Though the kingâ Reves. My curse Hunt him to shame as flagrant as the glory Of our crushed house! May!âO, 'tis brave to war With these tongue-pellets! I've delayed too long. [Felicia suddenly intercepts him, and lays her hand on his arm. Why do you hold me? Fel. Basil, you nurse some scheme Against the king. Reves. Wondrous! You're a Cassandra, And deal in prophecy. Fel. Like hersâof danger. Reves. Excellent! Fel. Is there none? Reves. And if there were, Did ever daughter of our house urge danger To bar a brother's path? Fel. She does not now, If duty summons. See, I loose my clasp. Say thou art called by that which in calm hours Thy heart counts duty, and I bid thee go, Though the risk be life. Reves. I go, then. It is duty To guard a people's rights. Fel. One moment yet! Is it the people's rights, or thine own wrongs, That sway thee most! Reves. What matters which? Fel. Much, Basil. Do things in their true names. Take thou thy vengeance, If it be right, as vengeance; but don't call it Love for a people's rights. Reves. Both may combine. Fel. Scarcely. Hate cannot blend with a pure will, And not corrupt it. Brother, earth has seen Few patriots. These, if they strove with wrong, Strove first by reason and by prayers; hast thou? They knew each sounding of the nation's course; Dost thou, till late secluded in these walls? If they did strike, 'twas in extremity, In grief, at cost of household ties, with yearnings To sheathe the sword they drew; canst thou so strike? Reves. Who lessons me, and dares to preach my duties? Fel. [Kneeling.] Thyself, whose truth and honour in clear seasons Shone on thy sister's soul, and, kindling there, Shine back to guide thee now in hours of storm! Reves. [After a pause, dropping his cloak.] You're right, Felicia. I forego this purpose Till I have pondered well, and asked my heart If honour prompt it. I'll not take revenge Under the mask of justice. Yet, 'twas all He had left me in my wreck! Fel. All? Reves. [Embracing her.] No, my sister! Enter Richard. Rich. Your lordship's pardon! Master Bancroft's here, And much desires to see you. Reves. [Aside.] It must be. Tell him I come. [Richard goes out. Fel. Bancroft, I never hear That name without a shudder. Reves. Fear not, sweet! He comes on pressing businessâthe near sale Of Revesdale for his cousin's debt. Fel. And then? Reves. Thou wilt be with me; where thou art is home. [He passes his arm round her, and conducts her out. SCENE III. Grounds in front of Revesdale Castle. Enter Lord Revesdale, followed by Bancroft. Reves. Be it so, sir; it is your cousin's right, His fair undoubted right, to sell my lands. So must my father's heavy debt be cancelled. Ban. My kinsman, so he writes me, needs large sums For present uses, so the lands must go. Yet, though I've not much cause to bear you love, It frets me that your ancient, proud domain Should pass to strangers. Reves. All that's needful else You will see done. Ban. Though if young Ringwood buy it, 'Twill scarcely fall to strangers. Reves. Ringwood buy it! Ban. Has he not broken with you upon this? Reves. Never! Ban. He might have thought, perhaps, the old Revesdale blood Would fire at such successionâthe brewer's grandson! Reves. [With an effort.] And my friend, sir! He told you his intent? Ban. He told my agent. [Jestingly.] 'Tis a foolish thought, But yet, had proof confirmed the general rumour Of Ringwood's traitorous aid to the Duke of Monmouth, He had found a different fate! Reves. [Regarding him keenly.] There are such rumours? Ban. [Aside.] He knows it! Proved, they'd check the aspiring pride That vaults into your seat. Reves. Ay, sir; you've taught us What the king's mercy is. Ban. [Aside.] You taunt me, do you? Even to my face? [With feigned merriment.] You never surely thought I meant the scaffold? Pshaw! the king's grown lenient. Most noted traitors 'scape with fine or exile. Reves. Such converse, Master Bancroft, as affairs Demand between us, I would give with patience To you or any man. Beyond that point You trespass on my leisure. Ban. [Aside.] Ay, the bloodhound Is not fit mate for a Revesdale!âAs you will. Again, I say, I bear you little love, And proffer none. But I respect a house As old as yours, and hate the parasite That thrives upon a ruin! [Aside.] Yes, he flinched! I stung his ruling passion. Thanks to that, And to my surly bluntness, which must tell In time for honestyâI'll mould him yet! [Bancroft goes out. Reves. Again he couples Arthur's name with treason! I must be wary; a chance word or look Might snare my friend. My friend! who covertly Plots to be Lord of Revesdale! He'd not steal So subtly on my track, see me driven forth From my ancestral home, this native ground Of my soul as well as body, and then kindle His holiday taper in the silent halls Where my torch is grey in ashes! Enter Felicia, with Richard and Giles. Fel. Yes, good friends, I'll bear your message. [Richard and Giles go out. Felicia advances to Revesdale.] You're in thought? Reves. No, sister! Fel. Richard and Giles demand a boon. Reves. From me! What have I left to grant? Fel. That where you go They may go too. They are content for hire To take what fortune sends; or, unhired, serve you For your love, that never let them feed like hirelings. Reves. [Much moved.] True friends! I thank and bless them. Age and sickness Will chill these faithful hearts, and ruined Revesdale Must let them perish aidless. Fel. None so perish Who trust in Heaven, my brother! Reves. You say well, And I'll not murmur. Though another week Must see us strangers hereâhere, where our banner Flung, like a sunward wing, its mighty shade O'er a brood of heroesâstill I'll think whom Heaven Has left me in my exileâthee! Fel. My bother! [He embraces her. Reves. And time shall teach me to endure, forget, Ay, and hope too! ThereâI say hope already! Enter Richard. Rich. A letter for your lordship. [Gives it.] Would it bore Some news to cheer him! [He goes out. Reves. [Cheerfully.] We've this comfort, sister, Our poverty is proof against ill tidings. [He opens and peruses the letter. Ah, ah! Fel. You're moved! Reves. They'll cheat me and die out, These words of light! O, like the tints of rainbows, They build heaven's arch on storm, and, being as bright, Perhaps may vanish like them! Fel. What is this? Reves. Such joy as almost dazzles me to doubt. Redemption of our house and wealth, though wealth I prize but for our house! Fel. Is this news sure? Reves. I trust so; you might make it sure. It comes From our best and most tried friendâ Fel. Dear, kind Lord Norville, Who pressed your suit at Court? Reves. Yes, he has a claim, He thinks, upon the minister who needs His special service, and the price he asks Is justice to his friend! Fel. To you! Oh, bless him! Reves. That's what he asks for. Bless him, for you can! This flashed on me at times when you met in London. Fel. What flashed upon you, Basil? Reves. What he writes So plainly hereâforgive my joy's abruptnessâ He loves you, and would wed you. Fel. Me!âLord Norville!â Impossible! Reves. Why so? My friend is noble In heart, mien, birthâ Fel. I know it! Reves. One for whom You've oft avowed regard, which must, in time, Ripen to love! Fel. [Aside.] Although I promised silence, I must reveal my troth to Arthur. Brother, I cannot wed Lord Norvilleâ Reves. Cannot! Pause; Think what's at stakeâthe upholding of our line In honour by his aid! They'll grant his wifeâ He writes itâwhat they might refuse his friend. Fel. You talk not like yourself. Reves. Myself! Our race Adjures thee through thy brother! Fel. Basil! Reves. [Pointing to the Castle.] Look On that grey pile, from base to parapet A fane of glory!âStone? 'Tis built of deeds, Compact with hearts' blood; heroes trod its courts Whose names are histories; voices from its halls Swept o'er a realm like winds that wake a sea; A tide of memory richer than the sun Pours through each loophole, and its very dust Sown with traditionâglory's fallen seedâ Stirs with the quickening future! Fel. Oh, beware! Such pride tempts Heaven. Reves. Heaven made the valeâit sinks; The peakâit soars. I tell thee, to my frame Its vital flood's less dear than to my soul The trust my fathers left. Felicia, thinkâ The Court against me, not a chance to rise In war or council, doomed to sordid need And banishment from henceâas, if you scorn Lord Norville's suit, we areâwhat path remains Of enterprise or greatness? Fel. Brother, greatness Is of the soul, not fortune. Emulate The spirit of our sires, but leave to Heaven The question of their fame. Enter Bancroft. Reves. I ask my sister For life, or what is dearer, and she deigns me A homily for answer. [Turning from her, he perceives Bancroft.] Here again? [They converse apart from Felicia. Ban. My errand's brief. Young Ringwood asks my agent For an inventory; will you grant it? Reves. How? Ban. A catalogue of all your movables, Plate, pictures, suits of armour, family jewelsâ No, jewels pass as heirlooms. Reves. How? You jest. Ban. 'Tis natural; Men like to know the worth of that they buy. But he wrote in secret, and with emphasis Forbade that you should know it. Reves. Wrote in secret! Ban. But as we could not take the inventory As yet without your licence, I was bound To let you hear. Reves. Such insult! Oh, my ears Have played me false! Ban. Then trust your eyes, and read His letter to my agent, who waits yonder. Reves. In his own hand! Ban. 'Tis strange! I thought these plans Bore on his contract for your sister. Reves. [Starting, and glancing rapidly at Felicia, who stands apart.] Hush! I must hear all! Ban. You can't be ignorant Of his suit? Reves. His suitâto wed my sister! Such an aim Had jarred upon my love when most in tune: But now!âYou bear him malice! Ban. I don't doat Either on him or you; but I brook the proud More easily than the false. Reves. [Aside.] Why should I doubt This man? Though fierce and violent, he wears His nature frankly, shows his plain distaste For me, nor stoops to counterfeit a smoothness, As would dissemblers. Ban. You may think me bitter. Well, I come of an old stock myself, and like not Your treacherous upstarts. Let me ask you this: Who, when you were dismissed from the militia, Leaped to the vacant post, making your slight His honour! Prudent friend! Who now by stealth, Lest your pride wake and thwart him, seeks possession Of your house and union with your blood, to gild His base beginnings? Reves. Hold! I'll sift your story But to disprove it. Hither! I'll return Anon, Felicia. Hither, sir; unfold This business as we walk. [Revesdale and Bancroft go out. Fel. [Coming forward.] O bitter strait! I must be false to loveânay, worseâto conscience, Or crush my brother's hopes. Alas that pride Should blight a heart so rich! Most perilous Is pride to noble natures. Other sins Stand naked and repel; but pride doth filch The garb of poetry, and the flawed idol Shows like a god. Enter Matthew and Arthur Ringwood. Arth. See! 'tis herselfâFelicia! How stillâhow muteâhow like a living dream That's conscious of its bliss, and will not stir Lest motion end it! Mat. Dream, forsooth! [Aside.] He talks Poetry like the laureate! Dream! Do dreams Glow with a flush like hers, or do their steps Come tinkling on men's hearts like hers on thine? Arth. [Embracing Felicia.] My own! Fel. Arthur! Mat. Is she a dream, lad? Arth. How! There's trouble in thine eye. Fel. I'm glad you're come. Mat. Not so am I. I'm tired, and want my dinner. What's dinner to a lover? You that feed On the dews of violets,âyou sleep-walkers In the realms of fancy, that can take your rest With open eyes, should pity common folk That have digestions, and like easy chairs. Arth. But where is Basil? Mat. Is our secret safe? Is he yet i' the dark? Fel. My friend, my father! Mat. Well? Speak, love! Fel. Untoward affairs have vexed my brother. You'll treat him gently? Mat. Gently! Why, how else But gently should I treat him? I bestow My boyâthan whom a nobler never blessed A father's heartâupon him for a brother. Methinks that's gentle. Arth. Look where comes my friend! How rapt in meditation! Re-enter Revesdale. Mat. [To Felicia.] You'll not leave us? Fel. [Observing Revesdale closely.] No, no; 'tis better I remain. Mat. [Laughing.] Draw back; He's in a trance; perhaps he solves a problem. [They retire a few steps, unperceived by Revesdale. Reves. Woos her in secret, does he? Wastes no breath To win my sanction, who should thank my luck That my home and sister please him! Our alliance, 'Tis true, has been held priceless; but this broker In decayed honours knows that it befits The needy to be humble. Is't for thee, Thou climber by the clefts of others' ruin, My sister has forsworn her happiness, Foiled my fresh hopes and balked my thirsting heart Of the fount before it? Not so; my friend Norville Stays at his seat in Hampshire. I'll set forth This hour to see him, and so gain delay For a wiser answer. [Matthew, Arthur, and Felicia come forward. Mat. Save you, noble student! Have you yet solved your riddle? Reves. Sir, you have it. Arth. I give you joy! Your hand. Reves. 'Tis not for sale. Arth. For sale! Mat. Nay, nay! We're here To join hands, not deny them. Faith, my lord, You must clear that clouded brow. I would acquaint you With my heiress and my new-found daughter! Reves. So, Your daughter. [Aside.] It goes smoothly! Mat. You're amazed. 'Twill crown your wonder when I say how long You've known her, you, sirâthat, in brief, she stands With her affianced husband thereâay, there! [Pointing to Arthur and Felicia. Go, boy, and bless them! Reves. Ingrate that I am, I have no knee to thank you. Arth. You'll not mar Our joy, else perfect? 'Twas but yesterday I dared to hopeâ Reves. What you must hope no more. [Restraining himself, and with formal courtesy. Sir, for the honour you design our house I thank you, and decline it. Mat. What! decline, My boy! Adversity has turned his brain. Decline my Arthur! Arth. Basil, pardon me. Your sister's love was her own gift. I stand, However humble, dignified in thisâ That she has chosen me, and girt my life With her bright zone of love. To yield her, then, Must be a pang to meâa worse than pang, A crime, to her. For her sakeâ Reves. [Ironically.] For her sake! Arth. Yes, for her sake, my lord. I do not boast A storied name. Perchance mine never waved Embroidered on a flag, or rallied hosts In the shock of battle. Courts may nothing heed it. The hind at plough may hear it and plod on, Nor check his careless whistle. Do you ask My title, then, in this? 'Tis hereâshe loves me! Spite of all want and accident, she loves me, Finds love that answers hers, finds truth to lean on, Finds sympathies that feed her root of joy, And keep it verdant. If I give not these, I have indeed no claim; but giving them, My lot grows proud. I am something to myself If aught to her. I'll not withdraw the faith She prizes, till she say, âSir, take it backâ I no more need it.â Fel. Never, never, Arthur, Can she say that! O brother! Mat. Stand apart, My boy, and let them speak. [Arthur and Matthew retire a few steps. Reves. And so you'll blight My future and your own for a light mood That dates from yesterdayâa whim, a nothing! Fel. A nothing! All new life, that struck its fibres Deep down before it budded! Nothing! Basil, Earth has a thousand destinies for man; For us, oneâlove! Man's massive trunk puts forth Unnumbered branches; lop them, they renew; But we who cling around him, severed thence, Are prostrate once for ever. Reves. Credulous girl, Be warned! What Ringwood seeks in this alliance Is his advancement, not your love. For this, Unknown to me, he lured you step by step. Fel. Your frenzy speaks! Reves. For this, by stealth he traffics For our domain, as if to seize our eyry Made him the eagleâdoes this, and commands That the knowledge be kept from me! Fel. Question him; He'll explain all. Reves. [Ironically.] To be sure he will! And now, To save you and those hopes he would eclipse, Listen! I'm bound for a sudden journey. Ere I go, decideâa suitor or a brother? Fel. [Seizing his hand.] You cannot meanâ Reves. Decide at onceârenounce him! Fel. He has loved me, and I cannot; I have pledged My love to him, and will not; 'tis your wish To cast me off, not mine to lose you, brother. I must be trueâI wed him! [She turns to Arthur and Matthew, who advance. Reves. Free my hand! [To Arthur.] Sir, till your gold gives right to unlock my gates, You pass them not again. [To Felicia.] Release me! Fel. [Clinging to him.] Brother! Reves. When next we meet, I see thee Norville's wife, His wife affianced, or a strangerâstrange Thenceforth to sight, thought, love; thy name a sound, Thy place a void, thy very memory dead! [He breaks away from Felicia, and rushes out. Fel. Bear witness, heart, I had no choice but this! [She sinks into Arthur's arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An oak chamber in Revesdale Castle; door at back leading to chapel. Night. Enter Alice and Richard, bearing lamp, and ushering in Arthur Ringwood. Alice. This way, your honourâthis way, Master Arthur. May it prove a joyful day, or rather night. You're kindly welcome. Rich. Welcome! You forget 'Tis for the young squire here to welcome us. The Castle now is his. Alice. How thy wits wander! Arth. What says good Alice? Rich. Nay, she'll not believe That you've bought Revesdale, and are lord of it. Alice. Revesdale's the lord of Revesdale. In the time Of my grandsire's grandsire, it had been so years Beyond his count. Arth. It was so then. Alice. What then was Must be so still. I'm grown too old to change. Arth. Too faithful, say. Alice. I see now why my son Called you the lord of Revesdale. 'Tis because You'll wed the lady of Revesdale. [To Richard.] Thy poor wits That once wast shrewd! 'Tis not the wife gives rank, But the husband. Rest ye, gentles, for awhile; I'll bring my beauty to ye, my dear childâ I'll bring the bride anon. [She goes out. Enter Matthew Ringwood. Mat. The priest attends, And all's prepared. A word with you, friend Richard, On this near marriage. Arth. His true service claims Full confidence. [To Richard.] Your lady takes a husband In her brother's absenceânay, against his will. You like not that, nor I; but reasons strong And just enforce it. Rich. What my mistress does Must needs be right. Arth. True; but your lord being adverse, We would not use such public ceremony As might offend him; therefore hold our union Private, as we would have it. Rich. I'll be heedful. [He retires to back, and occupies himself in arranging the apartment. Mat. So Revesdale now is ours! and thy Felicia Knows why we bought the Castle and domain? Arth. She does. I told her, that should chance restore Her brother's wealth, it should again be his. Mat. A costly purchase! Ringwood must be sold To stock our empty coffers. But for that, Its old walls had received you. Rich. See, my mistress! Enter Felicia in bridal attire, accompanied by Alice. Fel. [To Alice.] Await me here. [Advancing.] An unattended bride, No kindred nor companions to present me To my dear lord, I do present myself. Arth. There is no herald to thy love so fit As its own music. Mat. Bless you for his sake, My brave, true child! Arth. And yet my heart, Felicia, Half shrinks to take its treasure. If one doubtâ Fel. There's no doubtâcan be none.âArthur, I've weighed Each point of duty. Basil, ere he went, Left me these written words:ââBy all that makes An oath inviolable, on my return You part from Ringwood or from me. Obey, Or seek a separate home.â That oath he'll keep. His journey's to your rival's house, in hopes His suit may shake my purpose. To await Basil's return, what were it but to wage A fruitless strife, and widen for no cause Our household wounds? In all becomes a sister I'd drain my heart for him; but in that love Which holds not of our kin, but straight from heaven, Doth blend two souls in oneâwho owns that claim, Must own it paramount. Arth. O, pardon me, If jealousy for thy pure nobleness Makes question still. What if our union, private, Unknown beyond these walls, yet linking us In closest contract, draw on thee reproach From the malignant? What if they should sayâ Mat. What can they say, but that an honoured lady Receives two honoured guests? In a few days Her brother will return, and all be told. Fel. My love past doubt, I'll place beyond dispute. Alice. [Coming forward.] Now, ladybird, the priest Attends; my darling's stayed for. Mat. May Heaven's grace Bless thee, my daughter! 'Tis some forty years Since, as that boy stands now, I stood with one Gentle and fair like thee. She left me him For my age's solace; and I think, though friends Are scanty here, perhaps an angel's eyes Look on these bridals. There!âdon't think that grief Flows in these drops. I see the future through them, The happy future!âBasil reconciled, As he must be when he knows us, a glad group Round the old man at the hearth, and, in good time, Perhaps upon his kneesâWhat was I saying? Lean on your bridesman, girl. Now, boy, your arm To Mistress Alice! Arth. Alice! Alice. Sir, that everâ Arth. [Placing her arm in his.] I shall claim my kiss! Alice. Ah, well-a-day! Mat. Come, daughter! [Arthur with Alice, Matthew with Felicia, go into the adjoining chapel, from which the music of an organ is heard, Richard lighting them. SCENE II. An interval of nearly a day is supposed to elapsed between the first and second scenes of this act. An apartment in a roadside hostelry. Fireplace. Drayton, Miles, and Holme seated at table before the fire; on table a bottle of wine and glasses. A large screen behind them divides the apartment. Dray. Alone? Miles. [Looking behind the screen.] Not a mouse hears. Dray. Then one last cup To our patron ere we move. Holme. Drink deepâSuccess To Russell and his mission! [All drink.] Now or never Is the adventure's time. The people's heart Would leap to it. Dray. These Dutchmen never hurry. Miles. Fill up! Our task's done, and we've baffled Bancroft. Holme. We're safer, being these twenty miles apart. I liked not his close conference with Lord Revesdale. Dray. No danger there; a Revesdale ne'er betrayed. And my lord was in our power, having signed to treason, Whose penalty is death. Holme. [Refilling his glass.] So his lands are sold! Dray. It had been gold well spent had some we wot of Bought Revesdale Castle. Here's the plan of'tâsee! A height commanding all the bay. [He exhibits the plan, and, as they examine and discuss it, Revesdale enters with the Landlord unobserved. Reves. [Apart to Landlord.] Wine, host, And a fresh horse! and quickly. I'd reach home Ere night. [Landlord goes out.] Disastrous chance, that called my friend From his house before I reached it, and so wasted My day in the vain hope of his return! [Landlord re-enters with salver and bottle of wine and glass, and places them on table. Landlord goes out. Strangers! [He retires to back of screen and sits. Dray. Ay, Revesdale Castle's in bad hands. Miles. In upstart Ringwood's, who refused our league, Because, forsooth, the cause lacked better vouchers! Holme. How brooks the proud Lord Basil to see Ringwood Master of Revesdale? Miles. Soon to wed his sister. Holme. A bridegroom who should blazon on his shield Three vats, with crestâa malt-sack! Dray. 'Tis well Revesdale Has been of late from home; though they were friends, He'd scarcely brook young Ringwood's license, or This gossip on his sister. [All laugh and rise. Holme. But that tale Touching her chamber! It's mere jest? Dray. 'Tis sworn to By our landlord's niece, a dweller in the village, Who, having business with the lady, entered The room inopportunely. [Renewed laughter. Reves. [Starting up, and advancing to them.] May I share Your pleasant secret, sirs? Miles. My lord! Reves. Go on! My sister and her chamber? Stint not breath; I would laugh too. Dray. Your sister? Reves. Ay, her chamber? Dray. [Hesitating.] My lord, it has been new furnished in your absence To suit young Ringwood's taste. Miles. Whereat we laughed Holme. No offence, I hope? Reves. Beware! You're warned; bewareâ Dray. Nay, nay; we fear not threats; but own the claim Of your misfortunes. If in light discourse, We have given unmeant offence, accept our sorrow, And grant your pardon. [Revesdale bows haughtily, and walks apart.] Come, the day wears down. Holme. Have with you! Dray. [To Miles, who refills his glass.] Sirrah, d'ye mean To sit your horse? Miles. [Draining his glass.] There, there! Dray. Good day, my lord! [Drayton, Miles, and Holme go out. Reves. [Coming forward.] My lands are sold then; Revesdale now is Ringwood's! To-day, these men came from the very spot That was our homeâwas for five hundred years! What meant their mirth about my sister's chamber? There lurked beneath it more than they expressed. 'Tis plain that all men know young Ringwood's suit, And her consent. [After a pause, with uncontrollable passion.] Would hurricanes had strewed Earth with my towers! would that the earth, our soil, Had gaped, and so engulfed them!âWed Felicia! Our blood that sprang from mountain heights of time, Caught glory's rays while all below was darkâ Had fate no blast to freeze, no torrid heat To scorch, even to its bed, that stream, or e'er It lapsed into a sluice, and turned a mill-wheel? Well, well; well, well! [Drinks excitedly, and throws himself into chair. Enter Bancroft. Ban. Are those I sought not here? Mine host is ignorant, or bribed. [Aside.] How, Revesdale! He meets my very wish. That scrupulous sense Called honour sways him so, that in cool blood 'Twere vain to tempt him; but I've news will lash His passions into furyâfact, broad fact, The man whom most he hates his sister's guest, And by a village matron found last night Where no foot but a husband's should intrude! This, if I know my lord, shall gain my ends, And so arouse his pride, that, like a sea, In fury, and unconscious, he'll cast up His inmost secrets. [Feigning surprise.] Ah! whom do I look on? Lord Revesdale? 'Tis my honoured lord! Reves. [Fiercely.] Your will? Why mock with this feigned respect a ruined outcast? Ban. Because you are one; I can show respect, And not be thought to flatter. Reves. [Recklessly.] Right!âAt least I'm a gainer that way! Ban. [Aside.] Wine or rage, or both, Have fevered him. The better!âyou've heard all? Reves. [Aside.] Peace, heart! Such griefs as thine are not to prate of, As hawkers prate their ballads.âYes, sir, all. Ban. That your castle's sold? Reves. Ay. Ban. And to whom? Reves. That, too. Ban. You bear it nobly. Strangers were more loud In your behalf than you. No man would bid For your inheritance, save Arthur Ringwood. Reves. It fell to him cheaply, then? Ban. This fortitude, Though I rejoice at it, seems more than natural. Dull wit! You have compounded with young Ringwood, Renewed your friendship! To be sure you have! Well, well! 'Twas prudent; you had no resource But to yield your sister, and to trust his bounty. Reves. You're venturous, sir! Ban. Plague on't! my rough, blunt way. I might have guessed before That you were reconciled, or he had not dared, While Revesdale yet was yours, to come there wooing, Against your strict command. Reves. When I left homeâ I mean, left Revesdale? Ban. There the next day found him, The next to that, the third; at last he stayed. Reves. Stayed! where? at Revesdale? and my sister? Ban. There I'm baffled. If with your leave he wooed her, why Forget all caution in his interviews, And draw men's gossip on her? Reves. Gossip! Ban. Well, I'm loth to call it scandal, but the world Will judge by what it sees. Reves. Judge what? [Bancroft averts his face.] Judge what? Ban. What would you judge yourself, if a gallant, Unwedded, sought a maiden in her home, No father near, nor brother, she aloneâ Sought her at eve, and had not left at dawn? At least, he slept at Revesdale yesternight. Reves. 'Neath the same roof with her? Ban. Yes, one despatched On an errand to your sister, unawares Entering the boudoir which adjoins her chamber, Found him there late. Reves. In her chamber? Ban. Nay, I said The adjoining room; now, though I charge no guiltâ Reves. Guilt! Guilt! Ban. You're so intemperate; I but say 'Twas indiscreet! Reves. 'Twas indiscreet! Ah! now The jests those men cast on her flash upon me In their foul sense! Felicia, a theme For ribald tongues, a name for reeking lips To mouth between the drainings of a flagon, A key-note to the chorus of such laughter As shakes a tavern! Ban. [Aside.] The gale whistles now! Reves. My innocent one, that in her orphanhood Flew to my bosom dovelike; whose small hand Our dying mother clasped in mine to guard, And sanctified love's natural bonds at birth, By prayers in death; my darling, whom I loved Even as my better self! O traitor! why Not thrust at my heart only? Stripped, forlorn, And humbled, one pang more had cost me little. But she, my sister! There be eyes in heaven That would forget the patience of the place, And haunt me with reproach if I forgave him! Ban. 'Tis sure he failed in decent reverence to her. Reves. Nay, had she been mere pulseless stone, she stood Niched in the pure tradition of our honour To bend men's thoughts in homage; but herself, Whose very life is purity, whose love, Thought, grace, flow from its fount, all purityâ To foul that stream of crystal from the urn Of shadowing ages! O, his star ascends And mine dies out; but from my ashes leaps A comet that shall cross his rising orb With fiery portent in the midst of heaven! Would we were met! Ban. Why? Reves. Ah, why, why? He seeks To blend with the blood of Revesdale, not to spill itâ He'd tell me so, I doubt not! Ban. Pity 'tis That you met ever. Reves. [Traversing the room impetuously, as if speaking to himself.] Be that hour accursed! Accursed the shows of genial fellowship And truth that won me to him! Cursed my weak And womanish pity that, while we were strangers, Sealed up my servants' lips that eagerly Sought to denounce his treason! Ban. [Aside.] Mad with rage, He knows not what he utters! Treason! Nayâ Reves. It perilled his head, though. Norris, Hurst, and others Of my following, heard it from his own confession. Ban. [Musing.] Norris and Hurst! Some skirmish then. [Approaching Revesdale.] I say Some petty skirmish, then? Reves. [Impatiently.] Ay, ay, his sword Drawn for the rebels while they fled or rallied. I know not nor remember. I but felt His danger and my pity. Ban. [Aside.] Hurst and Norris May have better memories.âAnd he stung the heel That, raised, could crush him. Reves. Peace! Ban. His very life Lying in your grasp,âyou see! Reves. Not I! Ban. That's strange. He is a traitor; you, with Hurst and Norris, Could prove him such. [Laying his hand familiarly on Revesdale's arm. Reves. Off, sir! [Throws off Bancroft.] I spear the foe That dares me with his tusk; but I don't chase him To pitfalls for the butcher! Ban. Humph! the king May be less precise in his hunting. Reves. Ah! You would notâ Ban. Fair journey to your lordship. [Going. Reves. Bancroft, stay! Ban. Not now; you're ruffled, and you shook me off As the bloodhound's paws had soiled you. [Aside.] Hurst and Norris! [Bancroft goes out. Reves. [After a pause, as if bewildered.] What have I done? Now do I see his drift. The villain who would tempt me thus would lie Or colour truth to dupe me. I'll pursue And drag him back! But wherefore? Could I chain His limbs, his tongue were free. That must be stilled At any cost! [Moves to the door.] His horse's hoofs! They trample Upon a living pathâmy honour! Yes, I've betrayed Ringwood! ay, betrayedâthe sin Of basest cowards. Vain to say my words Flew from me like the unconscious sparks from iron That's hammered when afire;â'twas in the furnace Of my own pride I let this demon heat me, And beat me to his shaping! Fool, whose hand, Clutching the shows of nobleness, let slip The very thing! And Arthurâah, why linger? They may be on his track, his life the game, And not a voice to warn! [Seizing his hat and cloak. I should have wings To save him! Ah, what wing will overtake Those angels who have fled meâPeace and Honour! [He rushes out. SCENE III. A spacious Gothic entrance-hall in Revesdale Castle; a massive staircase leading to apartments; many portraits of the Revesdale family are suspended conspicuously on the wall; cheering and dance music heard without; doors open. Enter Giles, Richard, and Servants. Giles. O happy day! You're sure of this good news? Rich. Quite sure; my mistress had it in a letter From some great lord in LondonâLordâLord Norville. He has pleaded with the king, and made him pay His debts to our master. Giles. Hurrah! [To the rest.] D'ye hear? Lord Basil Is rich again; the good old times we knew Are back once more. Ser. Brave news! brave news! Rich. Lord Revesdale, Being absent, knows not yet this happy change. Would he were here! He's to have Revesdale back. Our young squire bought it in the hope some chance Like this might give it to his friend again. Giles. He's a true friend, Squire Arthur! [Peasants laugh and shout without. Rich. See, here comes A holiday group! Our lady has thrown open The park and house for a festival in honour Of these blithe tidings; but the night drives in Our merry-makers. Enter male and female Peasants, preceded by Alice. Alice. [Advancing from the group in great excitement.] Now, son, who was right? Said I not Revesdale still was lord of Revesdale? And now all say it. Strike up, lads and girls! [Music. A dance. Giles. I could shake a leg myself. [Offers his arm to Alice, who, unable to control herself, joins the dance. Rich. [At conclusion of the dance.] Hold, hold, our lady! [Felicia, Matthew, and Arthur appear on the staircase. Peasants, &amp;c., range themselves at side. Join all! Long life to Revesdale and our lady! Chorus. [By the group.] Long live Lord Revesdale and his noble sister! Giles. And his honour and Squire Arthur! Group. Ay, long life And happiness to all! Fel. Thanks, thanks, good friends! Let me not check the mirth, for my heart shares it. [Felicia, Matthew, and Arthur descend the staircase and advance to front; all bow and curtsey, and then retire towards doors. Mat. [To dancers.] Well done! Fall to again! [To Felicia.] I feel So light, so gay! I never see the young Glad, but my old heart leaps up wild and full. I must dance, or sing, or kiss some one; I must! For fear of accidents, it shall be you. [Kisses her tenderly. Fel. Fie! You, a veteran! Mat. Veteran, girl! I'm young. True youth is like true wineâthe longer kept, The more the spirit of the grape comes out. Arth. There wants but one thing to complete our joyâ Basil's return. Mat. How, scapegrace? Do you feel No awe of the man from whom you've stolen his sister? Fel. No danger now. The winter that congealed His love dispelled, 'twill open all its sweets In Fortune's sunshine. 'Tis not in his heart To turn from your devotion. Mat. What delays him? 'Tis clear he's not with Norville, who despatched The letter that restored your brother's rights From London. Fel. You speak anxiously. Mat. No, no; There's nought to fear. And yet 'tis true the land Is rife with plots. Arth. I'm glad of it! Mat. Hush! Scarce a house But holds a spy. Hundreds are daily seized In the name of Order. Arth. Orderâname abused! When shall this harassed land know order more?â The glad obedience freemen pay the laws That keep them free. Cruelty on the bench, Fraud in the council, menace everywhere, The heart denied its commerce with the tongueâ Can there be order? Can unscrupulous power Strike on a nation's heartstrings with a gauntlet, And look for music? Mat. 'Tis said all men's hopes Are set on Holland; but the cautious prince Resists entreaty. Arth. Till his time be ripe. [Laughter from the Dancers at back. Fel. Leave these grave themes, and list their happy laughter. [A pause, during which they watch the Dancers. Reves. [Without.] Way, there! My sister! Arthur! Fel. Ah, that voice! [The group divides in consternation. Revesdale rushes in.] My brother! [Going to him. Reves. Touch me not! No, no embrace. Hence, Arthur, for your life! Arth. Go, friends. [Peasants go out with Alice, Richard, and Giles. Doors are closed.] Now, Basil? Reves. [Aside.] He is here; in that Bancroft spoke truth. [To Arthur.] By what right do you share One home with her? Fel. By the best rightâa husband's. My brotherâ Reves. [Aside.] Married! That explains the slander. Married! What depths of horror at that word Yawn in my path! Fly, Arthur, fly! Fel. You speak In terror, not in wrath. Reves. Fly! Arth. On this night, That hails you back to Revesdaleâto your Revesdale! Fel. Ay, brother, yours. Lord Norville from the king Has won your rights, and Arthur holds your lands But to restore them. Reves. [Aside.] Restore them! This for me, Beyond redemption lost! [To Arthur.] Why do you stand With that calm brow, when every moment falls Like a sand from the glass of fate? Fly for your life, From hence, from England! Mat. What do you mean? Reves. 'Tis knownâ His treason, or the deed which the law calls so, Is known. His foes are mustering, on their way, Fleet as the wind, stanch as remorse; there's not To spare a second! Arth. If suspicion's roused, Flight would confirm it. Those who seek my life May lie in wait at the port. 'Twere wiser far To stay and front them. Reves. Madness! [Kneeling to Arthur.] On my knees I do beseech youâ Fel. Hear him, Arthur; yield, My heart's beloved! Arth. And leave thee? Fel. Ay, to save Thyselfâmy self, that's wrapped in thine. Arth. But, hear me! Fel. Hear me! We'll fly together! Mat. It must not be. Arthur was right. Where are the proofs against him? His deed is known to none save Basil here And his trusty servants. All's secure; we'll face This crisis! [To Felicia.] Courage! Reves. [Aside.] Then I must confess My baseness. Arthur! Arth. Basil, 'tis your zeal For me provokes these fears. Ah! when most harsh, I felt that you were still my friend at heart, My warm, true friend! Reves. No, listen! If a wretchâ Ah! [A loud knocking is heard without. Revesdale stands as if tranced in horror. A short interval of silence. Knocking repeated. Fel. Husband! Reves. To the library. It opens On the rear of the parkâthe private path! Escape! [Drawing his sword and rushing to the door. I'll guard the door. More strength than's packed in iron Stiffens this arm! Hence! there's yet time. [Louder knocking and clamour without. Arth. [Seizing Revesdale's arm.] Resist not! Your life is perilled now. Reves. What bliss if that Could ransom thine! [Struggling with Arthur.] Arth. Be calm; I must remain. The doors are burst open, and Bancroft enters, followed by two Officers of the Militia. Ban. Disarm that madman! Reves. [Officers disarm Revesdale.] Villain! Ban. Arthur Ringwood, I arrest you for high treason! Mat. On whose charge? Ban. [Aside to Officers.] See those men, Hurst and Norris, kept apart, Then stand in call; quick! [Two Officers go out.] Arth. Still athirst for blood! Ban. Is it so strange in a bloodhound? That's the name You and my lord gave me; the name that crowds Chorus with yells. When I was so baptized, You were my sponsors. Giving me the name, Should I not have the nature? Know, your crime, If proved, is death. Mat. Say, who accuses him? None save you have suborned them. Ah, beware! My boy is loved of the peasants. Ban. No mob escort Shall see your son to prison; a detachment Of the king's force is sent for in his honour. Mat. I ask for his accuser. Ban. Ask my lord. Arth. Insolent scoffer! Fel. [Crossing to Revesdale, and speaking to him aside.] Do not heed him, Basil. Your anguish helps suspicion. It was night When the fray chanced; none recognised my husband, Or he had been seized before. Reves. 'Tis known! Fel. To none But Hurst and Norris, our old faithful followers; They would not act a baseness which no tongue Could curse to the full. Reves. There was a thirdâa third Who knew! Fel. Who? If he have betrayed My noble Arthur, may that solemn justice, Which, unlike man's, looks to the heart as well As to the act, judge him! Reves. It does, it does! Fel. His name? Why droop your head? He cannot be Your friend. You shudder! Ah, what fearful thoughts Dart through my brain! Your feud with Arthur, your Close intercourse with Bancroft, now that look! No, noâI loathe my mind for the doubt distraction, Not reason, prompts! Speak, brother, speak in mercy! This traitor's name? Reves. Behold him! [During the previous dialogue Matthew, Arthur, and Bancroft have approached them. Arth. Whom? Ban. A witness To your guilt. Here, sirs! [He goes up the stage and calls in Officers. Mat. My son! [To Felicia, who turns to Arthur.] Away! Thou hast no part in him! thou art his sister. Fel. No! Arth. Father! Mat. Forgive me, girl! [Extends his hand to her. Arth. Basil, what brought thee To this abasement? Reves. [In a deep whisper.] Why, my pride, that listened Unto that demon! Fel. [To Arthur.] Speak no more; let's meet Our fate in silence. Arth. Wife, his wretchedness Doth outweigh ours. Look on him, and have pity. Mat. Pity! he had none. Arth. [To Revesdale.] Say, how wast thou wrought To this extreme? Reves. I deemed by you our house Had suffered shame. [Two Officers go out. Fel. [With bitter laughter.] Our house! [Arthur signs to her to be silent.] If any speak, I must. Our house! Thy house! Where ranks thy name In its roll of heroes? [Pointing to portraits.] See, their pictured forms Start into life and ask thee! Art thou heir Of him whose chivalry spared gallant foes? Thou didst not spare thy friend! Of him whose counsels Quelled bloody strife 'twixt kingdoms? Thou hast stained With blood thy hearth! Of him whose tuneful lips Sang noble deeds? How will this deed of thine Tell with the minstrels? Rise, ye shapes august, And with your lips, white more with scorn than death, Renounce him for your son! Ban. Come, the king's business must be cared for now. Those stand without, who, till the troops arrive, Will be your guard in the castle. Arth. I am ready. Fel. But not alone. There's yet one comfort, loveâ That I can knit my fate so close with thine, No hand shall rend them. We await our doom. Ay, ours! If he be guilty, I partake His glorious crime! Arth. Felicia! Fel. I concealed him Within these walls to save his life. I failed, I triumph now, for I shall share his death! [Casts herself on Arthur's neck. Arth. What hast thou said? Ban. I would it were unspoken. I meant not ill to her; but for this deed The law exacts its due. [Goes up and signals. Several Officers enter; at a sign from Officers, Arthur and Felicia, followed by Matthew, go up towards door.] Conduct them hence. Reves. [As if awaking from stupor.] No, wretch! I'll save themâsaveâ [Felicia, ascending steps towards door, turns and looks earnestly at Revesdale; all go out but Revesdale, who stands awhile dumb and motionless; then, with a cry, falls prostrate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Same as last Scene. Revesdale is seated in an attitude of mental prostration, Richard leans over him; Bancroft stands apart, watching them. Ban. [To Richard.] He'll not answer? Rich. You've done your work too well; for these two hours Has he sat thus, more kin to death than life. Ban. [Aside.] Yet he must speak; for there be secrets still I would worm from him.âBid the guard conduct His sister here; the sight of her may rouse him. Rich. Ay, to new torture. Ban. Better that than humour A fatal lethargy. Go! [Richard goes out.] Our state secretary Writes in reproachâ[Reading from a letter.]ââthat I have missed my clew To traitors here, who signed the requisition To the Prince of Orange.â Now, of these, 'tis like One is young Ringwood. His known lenity To Monmouth's faction, and the treasonous acts By him committed, make suspicion strong. Could I discover this, and his confederates Deliver up to justice, wealth and honours Beyond all hope were mine. By threats or wiles, I'll wring the truth from Revesdale. Enter Felicia, guarded by two Officers. So! Retire. [Officers retire to door. A torpor on your brother hangs, pernicious To health and life. Your voice, perchance, may wake His slumbering sense. Fel. [Gazing on him.] So prostrate! O my brother! Now that my heart is calmer, it consents To my dear husband's pleading. Thy remorse Tells of a soul not base, but sorely tempted. Turn thy face hither; 'tis thy sister, Basil, Entreats thee! Reves. [Vacantly.] Who? Fel. Felicia. Reves. Let no bless'd shape Visit this gulf. There's one to come; for him I wait here. Fel. Whom expect you? Reves. Go! you're fair And pure; he'll not consort with such, the fiend Who plunged me here. Ban. [Approaching with coarse laughter.] He raves! Reves. [Springing upon him.] Ah, ah! thou'rt come; I have thee in my gripe! Ban. Let go your hold! Madman, be warned! release me! Off, I say! I'll crush thee to the earth! Reves. Fool! dost thou think My arms enfold thee merely? 'Tis my soul That grasps its tempter! Mighty with despair, It twines around thee, drags thee down, down, down To its perdition! Ban. Off! I choke! What right Have you for this? I sought my enemy's life, But youâ Reves. [Pausing.] Ay, well? Ban. Betrayed your friend! Reves. [Releases him and staggers back.] Thou'rt right. Thou hast crushed me to the earth! Fel. Basil! Reves. I look on thee, yet live! Fel. You never dreamed Of these sad issues. 'Twas a moment's frenzy Surprised and overcame you. Reves. Is't to a wretch Like me, your murdererâ Fel. Listen! If I'm wronged, I have a claim on thee. Oh, let my words Fall in thy soul like holy seed, which time Shall turn to fruitful duty. Live to prove He who repents can expiate; live to serve Thy kind, that thou may'st say, when grateful hearts Bless theeâI had a sister once, whose spirit Still lives in mine; she prayed for me, she blessed me; With her last breath she won me from despair, And left me what I am! [Revesdale interrupts her with a cry of anguish. Ban. [Looking off.] A step! who comes? Enter Officer. Well, sir, the troops? Officer. Are on their way. I met them with a force More fit to take a city than a prisoner. Ban. A wise precaution. Officer. On their heels the crowd Followed with shouts. Ban. And curses, doubtless. Officer. That I know not; I but bore your summons to their captain. He laughedââYour errand's stale; we were already Bent towards Revesdale.â Ban. [Surprised.] So! Officer. I set spurs to horse, And thus outrode them. [At a sign of dismissal from Bancroft, Officer goes out. Ban. Lady, you've scant time For preparation. Fel. Basil, one embrace! Reves. No, no! [Rushing up to Bancroft.] Bancroft, as yet the law knows not Of their offence; have pityâsave her!âsave Her husband! Ban. What, so low? Reves. [Sinking on his knees.] Ay, in the dust. Where should guilt be? So low! Oh, thou mightst tower Above me like a god! This prostrate thing That's at thy knees, helpless, disgraced, and hopeless, A word from thee can fire with hope, strength, honour. The worm crawls; thou canst bid it rise a man! Ban. There's but one chance. Let Ringwood own his share In the petition [Showing a letter] to the Prince of Orange, And trust to the king's mercy. Reves. [Rising.] What petition? Ban. That signed by traitors, urging William's presence, Implying, if not offering, support. Reves. [Aside.] The same I signed that day Felicia's prayers Won me from the conspiracy. [Aloud.] He never Set hand to that. Ban. Then he can give no clew To the plot. I cannot save them. 'Tis of moment, Most vital, some accomplice in that act Should be discovered. Reves. [Aside.] And my signature To the requisition makes me such accomplice! Ban. Time hurries. Officers! Reves. Go, sister. Bancroft, Remain. Fel. One last embrace. Reves. Not nowâI dare not; yet, A time may come. Go; we shall meet once more, Once more, my sister. [Felicia goes out, guarded by two Officers.] Now, you said detention Of one who signed that deed was vital. Save My sister and her husband, and I place An accomplice in your power. Ban. [Aside.] Ah! he bids high, If I could trust him; yet to lose my vengeance! Stay; I might compass both. Were Ringwood free, The troops who are at hand might overtake him. Reves. Your answer! The king's force is nigh. Ban. What ground Have I to trust you? Reves. This: I have confessed I know the traitor. If I break my word, The peril lights on me. Ban. It does already. Reves. I can be silent. Ban. [Aside.] True; the prey meanwhile May cheat me and escape. Will this accomplice Name his confederates? Reves. No. Ban. [Aside.] A foolish question! Once seized, if he prove obstinate, the rack Will force avowal. And within what time Will you reveal the culprit? Reves. When my sister And Ringwood are safe on shipboard. Ban. [Aside.] I'll so plan That ere they well spread sail they are pursued. Should they escape, the stake will justify My venture to the king. I take your terms. Reves. Quick, then; release them! Ban. Should you fail, be sure Your lifeâ Reves. Will answer it. Ban. I go; we meet Straight in the courtyard; but your pledgeâremember! [Bancroft goes out. Reves. He yields; they may be rescued! They may live In joy, with children round them, and my life, My worthless life, may save them. Well said, sister; He who repents can expiate! [He goes out. SCENE II. Courtyard of the Castle. Very large centre gates. Enter Bancroft and Officer. Ban. Mount you the roof of the castle; it commands The road for miles. The instant you catch sight Of the troops, return; I'll speed you with instructions To meet their leader. [Officer goes out.] So, 'tis well contrived. Enter Revesdale and Richard. Reves. She lies in the offing? Rich. Ay, sir. Reves. Bound, you say, To Holland? Haste, good Richard; see a boat Straight manned by the beach, and thither summon friends From the peasants and our people. Rich. Think it done. [Richard goes out. Reves. [To Bancroft.] The order for releaseâ Ban. Is given; even now Your sister and her husband quit the door. Reves. They pass this way! Ban. I've kept my share of the compact; Look to your own! Reves. [Aside.] 'Twill be a last farewell, And then these arms will no more fold a sister So noble, so forgiving, nor this hand Clasp his whom I so wronged, so basely wronged, And now would ransom! May they never know That ransom's price! Enter Felicia and Arthur, preceded by four Officers, followed by Alice, Giles, and a group of domestics, who press around them. Fel. Farewell, till happier times! [Embracing Alice. Oh, they will come! Farewell, kind friends! [Felicia and Arthur, with Officers, advance. Fel. My brother! Heaven has had mercy, and your prayers prevailed. Reves. They did. Arth. [Glancing at Bancroft.] And could his heart be touched with pity? 'Tis strange! Reves. Arthur! Arth. [Giving his hand.] Basil, believe no thought Of harshness lives between us. Reves. I believe it, My generous friend; farewell! Fel. Now to thine arms! Reves. Yes; now I think I dare embrace thee. Bless, Oh, bless and pardon me! [They embrace. Fel. From my heart's depths. But we shall meet again; you'll join us soon In the new land we seek? Promise! Reves. [Very tenderly.] How like you are To our lost mother, sweet! That's the same look Of anxious love she wore when we two children Rode from the hall, and I, rash brother, urged Your palfrey to his speed, or from the bough Broke off the blossoming chestnut for your hat. Fel. Ah, those old days, they'll come again! once more We'll be boy and girl together. [Anxiously.] Dear, we part But for a time. Reves. But for a time, Feliciaâ But for a time. Arth. Nay, there's some mystery. [Pointing. [To Bancroft.] Basil, you stand not in his power? Reves. [Affecting gaiety.] His power! His power! You stand so, lingering here; no safety Till you embark! Think of your father, Arthur; He waits you on the beach. Farewell, farewellâ No word but that! Arth. Basil! Fel. My brother! [Returning and embracing him. Reves. Go! [He gently forces them off, Officers following; Alice, Giles, and domestics go out. Ban. [Aside.] The troops not yet in sight! Reves. [Watching Felicia and Arthur from side.] The gate stands open; The beach is lined with friends; they pass the walls; The living lane divides; and yet one group Conceals the boat. Ah, now 'tis clear! the pilot Stands at the helm; they pause! 'Tis to embrace Their father. Now her foot is on the plank, And Arthur follows her. The rowers bend; It moves! it moves to the wide seas; they're saved! Thank God! thank God! [Kneeling. Ban. [Aside.] May storm and hidden shoal Wreak my full hate on Ringwood! [Suddenly, to Revesdale.] Now, your pledge! That traitor who subscribed the requisitionâ His name? Where lurks he? Reves. Lurks! Why should he lurk? The caitiff in his mesh lurks spider-like, Who from his very filament of life Spins death for others; cowards lurk, who gag Men's reason by their passions, and then strike A soul in fetters; bravos lurk, sometimes Beneath a soldier's cloak, and, spite of all, The slouch betrays them. Lurk! lurk thou! Thy victim Stands in broad day and waits thee. Ban. Who? Reves. Myself. Ban. You signed that deed? Reves. Ay. Ban. And you know your doom? Reves. 'Tis death. Ban. I see: you think to 'scape By naming your confederates. Well, proclaim them. Reves. Never! they're fled: thou hast lost the scent. [With scornful laughter. Ban. [Enraged, and half drawing.] Beware! Reves. [Touching the sword-hilt.] It is a sword; I thought to have seen a knife. Ban. Mark, then; 'tis not your death alone impends, But, ere death, torture. Reves. Torture! Man, I've lain Upon the rackâremorse; can thine affright me? Re-enter Officer. Ban. Well, laggard? Officer. Sir, the troopsâ Ban. A curse reward their dallying!â Officer. Are at hand. But for the mist, we had descried them long since. Ban. To your horse, and hide Your rowels in his flanks! Haste them! Officer. They come, Battalion on battalion, and the shout Of following crowds roars like a distant sea. [He goes out. Ban. That's strange! such numbers! [Goes to side.] Ah, the boat returns! And with its freightâRingwood, his wife! They land, And bend this way. Unlooked-for chance! Fools, fools! They're in my power at last, for now the troops Will bar escape! Reves. O fatal sight! Back, back! Ban. They're welcome. Guards! Enter Felicia, Arthur, Matthew, and Officers. The tables turn, my lord. Their lives and yours are at my mercy. Arth. No! Fel. Hold, husband! What! his life? Ban. He has confessed To a treasonous plot, and thereby bought your rescue, But screens his guilty partners. Hark, the troops! [Military music without. Not theirs slow justice. In one hour they try, Pronounce, despatch! Look on that pair. [Points to Felicia and Arthur.] The sun Climbs, they bask in his light, are here. An hour He will be in his zenith; but where they? 'Tis you must answer. Speak! Your comrades' names, Or friend and sister perish! [He beckons to Officers, who advance towards Felicia and Arthur; they halt at a signal from Bancroft. Reves. Wretch! to bribe The conscience through the heart. [In great agony.] Felicia! Arthur! What! must a brother doom them, or pollute Their very lives by blood! Off, tempter, off! No; I'll not buy their pure lives with dishonour. Earth has a Judge; I trust in Him to save them. Fel. [Embracing him.] O, twice redeemed, my brother! Mat. [To Revesdale.] My brave son! Ban. [To Officers.] Away with them! Away! Fel. They will not stir. Ban. How? Fel. [Clinging to Revesdale.] Hear! As through the mist we ploughed the main, A skiff crossed ours. Its pilot stayed our course, Inquired our name and errand. These being told, âReturn!â he cried; âno need to quit your shores; Friends follow youâfriends able to protect Or to avenge.â Wouldst meet those friends? [Cheering without at back.] Hark, hark, The cheers of thousands greet them! [Discharge of artillery at back.] Does that sound Shake thee? 'Tis but a whisper to the shout A nation's heart would utterâa free nation's! Enter Richard, Giles, and Alice. Retainers and Peasants rush in, shouting. Fling wide the gates! See William of Nassau, The Prince of Orange! [The large gates are thrown open, and discover in the distance the fleet, Prince William of Orange disembarking, the coast lined with troops and others. Soldiers, Banner-men, and Dignitaries discovered: renewed discharge of artillery. Felicia throws herself into Arthur's arms. Ban. But the troopsâ Mat. Go over to the Prince. [To Soldiers who have entered.] Secure this man. [Soldiers seize Bancroft. Wretches, by him suborned, as I shall prove, Have brought the innocent to timeless death. Mat. Off with him! [Several Soldiers go out with Bancroft. Arth. How fares Basil? Reves. Oh, as one Who, 'scaped from shipwreck, wakes, half deeming still The billows round him, but beholds the earth And the soft sky. Mat. You wake in a new reign. Fel. And, brother, with new hopes. Reves. To a new life! [Renewed shouts and discharge of artillery; the Prince is seen surrounded by his suite; he takes off his hat; flourish and shouts. END OF A LIFE'S RANSOM.</field>
