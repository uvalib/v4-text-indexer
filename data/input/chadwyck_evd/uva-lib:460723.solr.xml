      <field name="fulltext">AN ENGLISH TRAGEDY. A PLAY IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An anecdote of real life, which I heard my father relate, suggested to me the Third Scene of the Third Act of the following Play, which I wrote as a dramatic fragment before the idea of the whole had occurred to me. The preceding and subsequent portions of the drama were afterwards added to that scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE REVEREND WILLIAM HARNESS. My kind and honoured Friend, It is not without hesitation that I avail myself of your permission to dedicate this Play to you. Written between twenty and thirty years ago, it then challenged the indulgence of my friends, in spite of its many defects, as the possible promise of better things when I should have attained maturer powers. I, too, hoped what my friends were kind enough to expect, and looked forward to accomplishing something better; but alas! this is the only piece of work I have ever finished since the first essays of my school-girl days; and, therefore, most imperfect as it is, I have nothing better to offer you. Pray accept it, and with it the expression of my heartfelt regret that it is not a worthier token of the respect, gratitude, and affection with which I am Yours most truly, Fanny Kemble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Lord Alford. Judge Winthrop. John Forrester. James Forrester. Wilton. Mowbray. Illworth. Gentlemen, Servants of Lord Alford and Judge Winthrop. Anne, Winthrop's wife. Mary, Winthrop's sister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The scene lies partly in London and partly at Judge Winthrop's house in Surrey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene 1. A tavern in London. Enter John and James Forrester. JOHN FORRESTER. From Antwerp you shall certainly hear from me; And then as soon as I reach Ghent, and of my Speeding on the voyageâhow strange things Seem to untravelled eyesâhow Flanders ladies And Flanders lace may look to an Englishman, And all important matters, I will write of. JAMES. Especially forget not to apprize me As soon as my uncle diesâfor die he must, I take it; and, good John, when you come back, And are the Honourable Sir John Forrester, With sundry thousand pounds a-year, I beg You'll not forget your poorer younger brother. JOHN. Which way shall I remember thee? with alms From my new fortunes? JAMES. Faith, it may be so; I shall be out at elbows presently, An the dice use me not more courteously. JOHN. Dice seldom mend a tattered doublet, James. Thou'rt but a careless fellow, and I fear That I shall find thee, when I do come back, The poorer for my absence. JAMES. I do fear it; Good brother John, I fear it infinitely. Thy wisdom was a kind of floating buoy That held me up i' the midst of my unthrift; I fear when thou art gone, that I shall go To the very bottom. Thou'rt a lucky fellow! JOHN. Nay, now most men had said that, of the twain, Thou wert the luckier: eldest of our house, I yet have thence derived no good advantage, Save the honour of being head of a family More old than rich; whilst thou, the curly darling Of our old grandam Wentworth, didst inherit Her fortune and a younger brother's privilege To spend it like a madman, merrily: And yet I'm lucky, sayest thou. JAMES. Very lucky; You never play. JOHN. You might be lucky, too, Upon those terms. JAMES. You never wish to play; That's where you're lucky. JOHN. No, nor ever wish To cut a man's throat, or to steal his purse; Perhaps I'm lucky, too, in that. JAMES. Most certainly, For if you played, you might do one or both; I'm sure I've often thought I should do both. JOHN. Dear brother, what you thus speak jestingly Sounds very sadly in my ears; have patience, If now, about to leave you quite alone, For the first time since our poor father died, I use a little the elder brother's right, And leave thee, with these few hundred pounds I've saved Upon my last year's income, some few words Of counsel; dearest James, pray give me heed. JAMES. I would I could but mind as well as heed, And do as well as listenâyet the moneyâ JOHN. I do not want it, brother, and you may; You know I never play, and my outgoings Are measured always by my incomings; 'Tis yours, and yours alone. JAMES. Thanks, generous friend, I'll try and spend, not lose it. JOHN. Prithee do. Put not thy gentry into such ill company As dicers, drinkers, tavern-haunting folk; Kites that seem doves, but hover round their prey With beaks and talons whetted sharp for blood. Cram not thine honour and thine happiness Into that hollow cup, whence, with the dice, They shall come tumbling in what fashion fortune May please to order. Oh! be still above The power of chance, at least in thine own mind, Dear James, nor put thy manliness and worth At stake upon a hazard table. The money Is nought, but that thou canst not win or lose That, without losing at the self same time An infinite treasureâthine own good esteem; It is a deep stake, brother; do not risk it. JAMES. I will not say to thee that till thou come I'll not touch dice, I fear to be forsworn; But I will strive to be more moderate In venturing; and if I can, I will not Play while thou'rt gone. JOHN. That's well, good fellow! well? [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. The captain is on board, sir, and the wind Streaks with grey rippling lines the river's bosom; Your clothes are in the ship, all things are ready. JOHN. I come immediately. [Exit Servant. Brother, another word; Here is a letter to my friend Judge Winthrop; He'll see for thee into those scrolls and parchments That we were looking over yesterday. You'll find him, brother, a true Englishman; I cannot give a man a better name. JAMES. I will set out to-morrow, brother. JOHN. Goodâ While thou art there, perhaps it were as well To think of another matter, James; the Judge Has a fair sister, a most charming lady, Whom thou couldst easier love than I describe. When you look at her, think of what I say; A lovely, loving wife were a better monitor Than I can be; sweet lips, and gentle eyes, And woman's fond persuasion, should do more To sunder thee from those ill-favoured mistresses, The dice, than all my talking; and besides, 'Twixt man and man there is a boundary Not passable even by the closest kindred. But, an thou once wert married, thou shouldst find Each hour admonish thee not to betray Thine own and others' happiness to play. Come, let us go. I shall be late on board; Come with me to the stairs. JAMES. Would 'twere to Flanders! [Exeunt the two Forresters. Scene 2. Another chamber in the tavern. A table at which Alford, Illworth, Wilton, Mowbray, and others are sitting at dice. ALFORD. It's my throw. ILLWORTH. He will have the same, I'll wager. MOWBRAY. Impossible! he's had it three times running; Poor Wilton here can't speak. WILTON. Come, sir, will you throw. ALFORD. There 'tis again. OMNES. Again! ILLWORTH. I told you so; I'd bet upon him, sir, for a thousand pounds; He is the luckiest man in London. WILTON. And I The most unlucky dog in all the world! Some wine there, ho! some wine! MOWBRAY (aside). Be careful, Wilton, You mar your sole chance, if you lose your wits. WILTON (aloud). Sir, when one's money's lost, one's wit's lost too; It's gone already, sir. Bring me some wine! [Servant brings in wine; all the gentlemen drink, except Alford, Illworth, and Mowbray. ALFORD. You should not drink, sir, when you play; you see I do not. ILLWORTH. No, my lord, nor I. MOWBRAY. Nor I. Now Wilton, throw, and good success befriend you! WILTON. Thanks, friend! (throws) that's well! ALFORD (throws). Yes, sir, and that is better. Your stake is lost; what, will you play again? WILTON (rises). Damnation seize the dice! I'm ruined, ruined. Land mortgagedâmoney lostâmy lord, my lord! [Alford converses with other gentlemen; Mowbray walks up and down with Wilton, in great agitation. MOWBRAY. For God's sake, sir, be patient! 'tis not possible. WILTON. I say 'tis true; I saw it, and I know it. MOWBRAY. What, man! a lord play such a beggar's trick? WILTON. It was a beggar's trick; I'm sure he did it though! ALFORD. You seem disturbed, sir; I'm afraid your losses Something outwent your expectations; I shall be proud to give you your revenge. Shall we play again? WILTON. Oh! by no means, my lord, Your lordship's luck is more than I can cope with, (Aside)âBacked by your lordship's dexterous sleight of hand. ALFORD. I'm sorry, sir, my luck has been so great; Indeed I'm mostly lucky; I could wish I were notâI too often rob my friends. Good evening, gentlemen, I see you're going; Good Master Wilton, a good even to you. WILTON (aside). The curses of a ruined man light on you! [Exeunt Wilton, Mowbray, and the rest: manent Alford and Illworth. ALFORD. There's a fool who puts his finger in the candle, And cries because 'tis burnt. ILLWORTH. I see, my lord, You've not forgotten how to handle dice. ALFORD. No, Illworth:âand yet all's but nothing either; Thou seest the goodly show I make in town here, My carriages, my horses, and my servants. ILLWORTH. A comet's tail, a perfect blaze of splendour! ALFORD. All borrowed light, sir, for all that: I tell thee, I'm the poorest man in Christendom; and save When every now and then a money bag Without a head, like this fellow, comes to be squeezed, I've but a sorry time with the petitions Of a scurvy set of villains they call creditors. And whither art thou bound? ILLWORTH. My lord, to Florence. ALFORD. To Florence, ha! what the game's up in England? Or hast thou run a step beyond thy compass? ILLWORTH. Fortune and credit are with me so wrecked, That I must fly from England, which henceforth Has nought but chains and prison bars for me. ALFORD. That's a pity! but you'll thrive in Florence, Illworth. I'll give you letters to some friends of mine there; Men of good purses, whom you'll find worth knowing. You must not fail to find out old Matteo, The man who makes the curious dice you wot of; Somewhere in St. Peter's Street, near the Arno side. I'll find the very name of the place for thee, And give thee, too, an errand to him for me. But that I've other quarry in pursuit, I'd see fair Florence once again with thee. ILLWORTH. Your lordship means to stay in London? ALFORD. No. I'm bound to Surrey; I shall visit there A certain judge, who hath a pretty wife, Upon some special business. ILLWORTH. Of his own, Or yours, my lord? Do you know the lady? ALFORD. Yes, After a fashion, I admired her once; 'Twas thought she was an heiress, when I did so. She lost her fortune, and, I thought, her looks; She's married nowâand has grown fair again. ILLWORTH. Poor lady! I should say, poor gentleman! Does your lordship purpose to remain there long? ALFORD. Umph! I can't tell, sir, till I see the lady. I may have CÃ¦sar's fortune, or I may Sit ten years down before a female Troy: I fear not much the latter chance, however. ILLWORTH. No; your experience has not taught you fear. The conqueror of our proudest city beauties Could scarce be foiled by a simple country mistress. ALFORD. She is not country bred; dost think I'm whining After some rosy Amaryllida? This lady would have shone a dazzling star In the brightest court in Europe; she is perfect! So fair, so stately, so majestical, I never saw her peer! ILLWORTH. Why, my good lord, You're sure in love. ALFORD. Perhaps I am, a little, But not enough to puzzle me, good Illworth. Farewell! good speed to Florence! and don't forget The hand thus, and they never fall amiss. [Exeunt. Scene 3. A room in Judge Winthrop's house. Anne is discovered sitting at work: enter to her Mary with her lap full of flowers. ANNE. Oh! I am glad you're come! the morning wears, 'Tis near on noonâwe shall dine presently. Why, where hast thou been? thy dress is all disordered, And thy hair tangled, and all wet with dew: Where hast thou been? MARY. All through the park and garden. Oh, never mind my hair! Oh, Anne, the spring Is come again: the hollow dingle path Is soft with the swelling moss, all starry green; And by the old oak roots, the freckled primroses Are starting up: the golden crocus points, Like to a goodly rank of fairy spears, Are peering up behind the close box borders; And the snowdrops rang their silver bells at me As I ran past. Here are some violetsâ A handful that I gathered as I came Along the hawthorn hedge: delicious creatures! ANNE. How you kiss them, child! Why, one would think they were Your lover. MARY. I should like so sweet an one. Venus' fair Adonis, nor the youth Who died beside the brook wherein he gazed, Were not made into flowers one half so sweet. You know, Anne, you are married, and can tell Better than I can guess what manner of love One bears one's husband: for mine own good part, I cannot fancy that I e'er shall like Any man alive so well as I like my brother, Or any life so much as this I leadâ In the sunny walks, among the flower-plots, Where I am free to run, sing, laugh, and play, With my good friends the birds and butterflies. But you don't like the country. ANNE. Yes I do; I like it better than I did at first; I see more things here than I did at first; I look more at them, too;âa rosy sunset, Or a bright morning, now begins to be As good as a city pageant to me; and I grow To like the converse of all silent thingsâ Of trees and flowers, and wandering waters sweet, Of lights and shadows, Nature's visitors, Which come and make society in solitude, To cheer us. MARY. Yes, you're growing more to like it; Yet methinks you'd rather be in London, Leading your city life. ANNE. I was bred up to it. MARY. And I to this: and each loves best her own; Yet in some sort, I can feel how it is with youâ You are so beautiful, dear Anne; 'tis natural, Most natural, that you should love to be Where you can draw all eyes to wait on you You talk well, too, and those who do so love Fit audience to applaud. ANNE. No, not to applaud, But to respond. MARY. Alas! I cannot do so, I have no wit; yet Heaven knows I love you. I am not worthy to be your companion. ANNE. Fie! speak not thus; you make me blush, dear Mary. You are a fit companion for an angel. MARY. But then, my brother is your husband, Anne, And he can understand and prize you fully; And he loves you dearly, and admires you well, And thinks you excellent above all women. Does not his company make up for all You left i' the merry town? ANNE. Is your brother merry? MARY. No, in himself he's grave enough, I grant you; But then, why don't you make him laugh? ANNE. I can't. MARY. Oh yes, you could! I do, whene'er I see him. ANNE. Yes, and I often wonder how you dare. MARY. How I dare! why, one would think, to hear you, You were afraid of your good husband, Anne. ANNE. Well, so I amâI am afraid of him. MARY. Afraid of him! the gentlest soul alive! Afraid of him! ANNE. Aye, aye, 'tis easy, dear, For you to speak thus, who have known him always, And grown up on his knee: you're like some child Bred in a mountain land, and running boldly Where others fear to stand. Come, sit down here, And while you twist your flower-wreath I'll tell you After what fashion I was married, and then You'll see I have some cause for what I say. MARY. A story, oh a story! Kiss, me, good girl Well nowâand so? ANNE. You know, my mother died When I was but a little toddling thing; My father loved me with that passionate love That mostly grows where the heart has but one channel In which to pour itself. He was very wealthy, And nobly born, and proud, and I was nursed In the bosom of all stateliness and splendour. MARY. That's why you look so proud and queenly, love: Don't laugh, your pride becomes you infinitely. ANNE. Indeed! I did not know that I was proud. As I grew a woman I was daily taught That I was fair, and should be great and powerful; And at the court, and in the city revels, Whene'er I went abroad, a smiling crowd Came round me, full of ready courtesy And flattering worship, and my heart was full With the bright sunshine of prosperity, And took delight in all things. MARY. Had you many suitors? ANNE. Yes, Mary, many; though I was very young, Scarce sixteen. MARY. Did you fancy none of them? ANNE. YesânoâI scarcely know. MARY. You will not tell. ANNE. I would tell you if I could tell myself. My father was ambitious for me, and hoped, I know, to see me favour one of them, For marrying him I should have been a countess. MARY. Oh! would you like to have been a countess, Anne? ANNE. Yes, I suppose I should. MARY. Why didn't you marry him? ANNE. He never asked me: he was one of those Who, under the sharp flail of my misfortunes, Prov'd light and flew away. MARY. What sorry chaff! How very strange! ANNE. No, love, that is not strange; 'Tis you who are strange, and true, and lovely. MARY. Go onâand soâ ANNE. Suddenly a claim was made By some far distant kinsman of our house, Who had been long in foreign lands, to a shareâ A large share of my father's best estates. MARY. Was the claim rightful? ANNE. Many thought it so, And we were on the brink of being spoiled, When your brotherâ MARY. Yes, my brother took your cause And won it for you; I have heard that story. So then you married him? ANNE. 'Twas strange enough, That he, so grave, so silent, and so thoughtful, Should e'er have fallen to loving such an one; But so it was; and my father growing sick, Full gratefully resigned me to the hands Of this good guardian. My poor father died, And then this strange relation became heir To all th'estates which I had thought were mine; He became heir, too, to the friends and lovers That waited, as I found, on them, not me. Suddenly I was left alone in the world, And still your brother loved me, and at last, He was so kind to me, I married him. MARY. Well, are you sorry for it? ANNE. What a question? I do but wish that he were oftener with us. He's always busy; I scarce feel I know Aught of him, save that he is very good to me. MARY. He's good to every thing! Are you happy, then? ANNE. Yes, happy; yes, quite happy, certainly. [Clock strikes. MARY. Hark! it is noon, and here's my brother come. [Enter Winthrop. WINTHROP. Good morrow, dear! good morrow, my sweet wife! How has the morning sped, my mistresses? Why, Mary, thou art glowing like a rose; Thou hast been out: wert thou along with her, sweet? ANNE. No, I can't walk, you know; it wearies me. And Mary skims the sward like a young greyhound, And laughs at me because I am so slow. WINTHROP. Ne'er heed her, wench; we'll teach thee e'er we've done, To walk six miles ere breaking of thy fast. What hast thou done with the time? wrought at the loom? Let's seeâwhy Mary, why, should she go forth? See, here's a garden growing 'neath her fingers, More perfect than the real flowers they mimic. MARY. No doubt, for nothing natural is perfect. WINTHROP. My little Socrates! here's a carnation Might almost cheat my nose at Christmas-tide, Whilst in an hour, these buds that thou hast gathered Shall be trod underground, withered and pale. MARY. Yet you love best these children of the mould For that very cause, that they shall fade and die. Secure possession of mere mortal good Would prove no blessing could it last for ever. In its frail tenure lies its richest worth. We love that most, we mostly fear to lose, And the precious things of life are those that perish. Is it not so? WINTHROP. How wise thou art this morning! MARY. But is it not so? WINTHROP. It seems as tho' it were! Wife, you make roses better than the spring; I would my work were of such pleasant sort! ANNE. Have you had much hard work to do this morning? Are you weary? WINTHROP. Till I saw you, dear, I was. MARY. Come, let me kiss the cobwebs from thy brain. Look here, Anne, how this daffodil becomes him, Stuck in his doublet. Here, I'll put another In your hat for youâwhy, now you're beautiful! WINTHROP. Out, madcap! Wife, we must tame this saucy girl. Shall we shut her up, or seek a husband for her? MARY. Oh, shut me up! pray shut me up, dear brother! I'll take the prison very patiently, So you leave out the jailer. WINTHROP. Very well; We shall see anon; I expect from town to-morrow Two of our first gallantsâMaster James Forrester And the Lord Alford. When you see these gentlemen, Perhaps you'll change your mind. ANNE. Lord Alford, said you? WINTHROP. Aye, do you know him? ANNE. I did know him once, A littleâand very long ago. He has broken More hearts, they say, than any man in England. MARY. Thank Heaven, so fine a gentleman can scarce Think my heart worth the breaking! WINTHROP. To speak truth, Report talks loudly of him in such praises As I would rather he deserved than I. But that I know you, wenches, to be such As honest Englishwomen should be, I Might not so well have liked his Lordship's visit. He comes on business tho', and while he's here, You'll entertain him as becomes yourselves, And my dear wife and sister. MARY. Sure their worships Will soon be gone; they'll find us but dull company. [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Your dinner waits, sir. WINTHROP. Come, wife, do you hear; Leave planting of your flowersâthe dinner waits. MARY. And what's the otherâMaster Forrester? WINTHROP. I do not know him; you shall find that out, And with a woman's eye, sharp as her needle, Spy all his qualities in half an hour. MARY. Will you take my word for him, then? WINTHROP. Assuredly. MARY. Very good! A pretty book you give me here; But I shall spell it through, or I'm mistaken. For, court or country, still a man's a man. WINTHROP. That's very true; and to one wise as thou art I' the curious study of mankindâ MARY. Flout on. All their ill gifts I know in knowing thee; And whatsoe'er in other men appears, That's not in thee, may be set down for good. Thou art a judge, yet, by my word, thy judgment Touching this gentleman shall wait on mine. WINTHROP. Content, my small Minerva! Come, wife, come. [Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene 1. The garden of Winthrop's house. Enter Mary and James Forrester. MARY. And so you never heard of the flower-angels? JAMES. Never! Are you one of them? MARY. Oh! you are mocking me. JAMES. Believe me, no; but, for whene'er I see you, Be 't morn or eve, mid noon or starry night, A flower still hangs on your breast or in your hand: I thought perhaps you were a flower-angel. MARY. No, truly; but they're always near about me. JAMES. What are they? MARY. Happy sprites, whose charge it is To walk unseen about all garden paths, And live in the fragrant neighbourhood of flowers. No bud or blossom but hath such a keeper; In dim, damp wood, or on wide windy common, By loneliest marsh, where'er a flower may blow, Nursed in close gardens of man's fashioning, Or sown by that wandering seedsman, the free air, These angels haunt: the maid that on her casement Sets a flower-pot, hath one still watching there, And she that wears a blossom in her vest Keeps a good spirit hovering o'er her breast. I make you smile: this is not city talk. JAMES. Give me that rose you wearâfor I believe Partly in what you sayâso give it me, That I may have an angel near to me. MARY. So you take mine from meâwell, 'tis no matter. JAMES. Alas! you do not need such guardianship. But when this fades, then whither goes the sprite? MARY. I do not know; I ne'er did think of thatâ Perchance to some new-blown bud of the same kind. JAMES. My angel then will leave me. I could wish To have some flower growing ever near me, That should live as long as I didâsome sweet flower Whose loveliness and bloom should last my days, And whose good angel should be mine till death. Know you of any such? MARY. No, sir, of none. The dews begin to fall,â'tis growing evening. Shall we go in? JAMES. Oh! 'tis not evening yet: The air is warm and balmy, and the light Is bright on all the tree stems yet, dear Mary. MARY. Nay, but look yonder, how the sober sky Hath suited all itself in modest grey; And see, where the moon uplifts her pearly brow Over that soft brown cloud. JAMES. Ay, but look yonder, On my side of the garden, gentle mistress; The western heaven is full of rosy light, And on yon slope where the fallow deer stand grazing, How red the sunset falls! MARY. Look at the shadows: They are very long. JAMES. They will grow longer, Mary, And night will come, and after it to-morrow, When I must go from hence. MARY. Shall we go in? JAMES. One moment stand beneath this blossoming tree, That drops its snowy stars upon thy head, And let me, while I yet am at thy side, Gaze on this happy place that I must leave. MARY. Nay, speak not thus: these melancholy words, And the stealing twilight, fill my heart with sadness. Must you indeed begone? JAMES. I must indeed. The business I came hither to despatch Is all accomplished, all things quite cleared up: One blessed week has passed like one short day, And all is over. MARY. I am sorry. JAMES. What? What are you sorry for? MARY. That you must go. Shall you never come again? JAMES. Will you give me leave To come again? MARY. Oh yes, most gladly! JAMES. Mary, We are not speaking to each other truly. The words that from thy innocent lips I draw Might seem to some men warrant of a hope Which yet I have not; for I know thy thought Touches not mine. MARY. I do not understand you. I'm very sorry you must goâI would Your cause had been much harder to unravel. Then you had stayed here longer; I'd have shown you, Then, other walks and favourite paths of mine, And we should have seen the roses bloom together. What is the matter that you cover your eyes And sigh so?âhave I vexed you, Master Forrester? JAMES. Hush, hush, thou fairy! this is all too much! Oh, lay this little hand upon my breast, And feel the tempest thou hast wrought in me. MARY. You frighten me! Oh, pray let go my hand! 'Tis evening now, quite eveningâlet's go in. JAMES. Mary, my heart's bursting, I must speak it all. Mary, I love youâO maiden, words can't utter How much I love you! Oh no, do not leave me! Don't tremble: dost thou fear me, I who'd give My soul to save thee from the smallest harm? MARY. Let me go to my brother! Sir, this is not well; Youâyouâyou should not have said this to me. I can scarce breathe or stand. JAMES. Oh, sit down here! I will not breathe another word of love; Forgive me, but for pity's sake stay here. Don't fear; I will not touch thy hand, I will not E'en sit beside thee. May I stand here, Mary? MARY. Yes, sir. JAMES. The moonlight shines into your eyes, And makes them look like two soft streams of light. Listen! far down in the dusk, from yonder thickets, What sound is that? MARY. It is the nightingale: Is it not sweet? JAMES. Most melancholy sweet! Yet oh! not half so sweet as thy sweet voice. MARY. I'm better now, so pray let us go in. JAMES. Shall your brother know of all this secret talk? Shall I tell it him, and ask him if he'll give you To me to be my wife? Speak Mary, shall I? MARY. Ask what thou wilt; I will stay here no longer. [Exit. JAMES. For mercy's sake don't leave me! She is gone; Like some light vision of unearthly beauty, She's vanished! but the charm she shed around Remains. O blessed sward her feet have pressed, Be ever green! Thou happy, happy mound That didst receive her beauteous form, may flowers Cover thee sweetly all the live-long summer! And thou, delicious curtain of fresh blossoms, May the autumn crown thee with a glorious bearing! Ye lovely ministrants to man's delight, That seem so full of kindly sympathy With human joy, a lover's blessing on ye! And be this place for ever hallowed ground, First left by winter, by the summer's sun first found! [Exit. Scene 2. A room in Winthrop's house. Anne and Alford playing at chess; Winthrop reading. ALFORD. Fair Mistress Winthrop, you're too hard for me. WINTHROP (aside). I'm glad of it. ANNE. Your lordship is not playing As though you meant to win: I fear you spare me. Pray play in earnest, sir! ALFORD. Shall I do so, And win of you? ANNE. But that I did not fear The chance of losing, sir, I had not played. Pray show your strength; I'm bent to conquer you. ALFORD. That were an easier matter than you think, Perhaps, fair mistress. ANNE. I crave your lordship's pardon, I did not hear you. ALFORD. 'Tis no matter, madam; You had not heeded had you heard, perchance, And that had been worseâyour moves are very cautious. WINTHROP. Your lordship's not a foe to trifle with; She's right. ANNE. This game is mine, for a crown. ALFORD. Indeed! (Aside)âThe other game is mine, I think, though. [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Mistress, Here is a dame come up from the village, craves To speak a word with you. ANNE. Oh, 'tis Dame Ingle, husband; I bade her come, and promised her, moreover, Her husband's pardon. WINTHROP (to the Servant). You may go away. [Exit Servant. I'm sorry for it, wife. ANNE. Sorry for what? Why, 'tis but closing of your book a minute, And writing out the man's dismissal. WINTHROP. Nay, You promised him his pardon, and you must give it. ANNE. Why, sir, you jest; I promised it, indeed, Because I knew that you would give it. WINTHROP. You should not Have promised for another, Anne. ANNE. Pshaw! nonsense! 'Tis hard indeed if my credit may not reach To such a point as this! WINTHROP. Perhaps it is; But it may not. ANNE. What do you mean, Judge Winthrop? WINTHROP. That you have promised what you cannot do. ANNE. No; but you can. WINTHROP. Indeed, I cannot. ANNE. How! Cannot!âcannot set a man free from gaol, Who's there by your own warrant! You will not, You should have said. WINTHROP. I'll say it, thenâI will not Nay, Anne, ne'er frown, nor look so scornfully: I will not, and I cannot break the laws, By whose just doom this man is cast in prison. D'ye think I make the statutes I enforce? Nay, I am but their voiceâthe parchment sheet In which they are set down, that shows them forth. ANNE. Ne'er tell me, sir, but you have power enough To do this thing, if you were minded to it. What! the first man in the shire, Judge Winthrop, Not able to let a man go free from gaol? WINTHROP. Neither to send him thither nor take him thence Have I the powerâwere I the king of England, I could not do it. Thank Heaven! 'tis no man's will Can touch the free life of an Englishman,â Nought but the sovereign lawsânor take from any, The meanest soul alive in all this land, One tittle of his precious liberty. You have mistook the matter. ANNE. What shall be done? I told the woman I would get him free. WINTHROP. You must tell her now you cannot. Be content, wife; The man's not worth your care, and where he is, There he is best. ANNE. Nay, but I pledged my word. WINTHROP. You were to blame: I cannot help it, Anne. You need not vex yourself about the woman; I'll have her looked to well. ANNE. No doubt you will; But, sir, that's not the point. Must I go tell her, Judge Winthrop will not make my promise good, He has refused me?âshall I have no more Account made of my prayer than the next dame, Who comes from quarrelling on market-day To have her matters righted by his worship? WINTHROP. Your prayer is of no more account than hers, But of the same, Anne, and shall meet from me With the self-same justice. Unto her and you, And every one, I would deal righteously. ANNE. Have I, your wife, no other privileges? WINTHROP. Yes, manyâfolded in the private chamber Of my heart and home; none on the judgment-bench, Or in the court, wife. ANNE. Shall this be believed? WINTHROP. Come, you have left his lordship long enough, Pondering his next move;âget you to your game. I will go speak to the woman; where is she? ANNE. In the oak parlour, sir, I bade them put her. WINTHROP. Very well! Go to your game; and, Anne, remember, Be charier henceforth of your promises. [Exit Winthrop. ANNE. I cry you mercy, sir! Shall we go on? ALFORD. Your leisure is my master, gentle madam. I'm sorry for the failure of your suit. ANNE. O sir, I heed it not. ALFORD. A cause so pleaded, By such an one too, might have won itself. ANNE. It matters not at all. ALFORD. How many men Would have died gladly but for half those words! Madam, I think you are not in your gameâ That's a strange move: will you recall it? ANNE. No, sir; I don't recall what I once do. ALFORD. Take heed, then, And play more carefully, or I shall beat you; Your king's in check. ANNE. Pshaw! I am blind, I think. That's better. ALFORD. Hardly; there, you're caught again; Check to your king! ANNE (rising). I cannot play! I know not What I am doing! to be thus refused; Before a stranger, too, to have my promise, Like a child's brag, turned down my throat. ALFORD. 'Tis pity indeed! Perhaps, however, madam, You have already used Judge Winthrop's interest In these kind of matters. I have known some wives Who scattered their husband's influence so fast That they were left adry; their courtesies Were spent by their ladies with so free a hand. ANNE. 'Tis the first favour, sir, I ever asked him, And thus he answers me. ALFORD. The first! O Heaven! To be thus sued to, and to answer thus! Your husband, Mistress Winthrop, is a man Like none that ever lived in the world before. There beâay, hundredsâwho but for one word Of lightest bidding, uttered by such lips, Would leap into the fire. ANNE. O sir; but then One's husband never would be one of these. ALFORD. Fatal decree! that still possession dulls The sense to the owning the most precious treasure; Yet I had not believed this, but for seeing it. ANNE. 'Tis hard indeed! ALFORD. You, you whom I remember Absolute queen over so many hearts! The drooping of whose eyelid might have bid The lordliest of our court fall down before you In happy worship of your slightest wish; You to be thus refused!âI crave your pardonâ ANNE. O sir, go on! You saw it, and you may, And doubtless will, speak what you saw. You'll say You saw me, like an humbled school-girl, stand To be tutored about this and t'other word That I had spoke too much; to be denied The suit I asked, and bade take care henceforth What things I asked for;âand indeed I will! ALFORD. Have patience, madam!âit is true, your husband Might have more gently put you from your suit, Answered with something more of courtesy. Alas! I can imagine no such grief As having to deny a prayer of yours. ANNE. He does not think so. ALFORD. Pardon me, fair mistressâ You must make some allowances for age. The tender heart, that in that gentle breast With pity and with kindness throbs towards all things, Is young enough to have been Judge Winthrop's daughter's. Had you but mated your sweet prime of life With one akin to you in years, you had found Perchance a happier lot: but you forget, Time, as it goes, lays ice within our veins, Which coldly curdles round an old man's heart: 'Tis not your husband's fault, but your ill fortune, That he no more is young. ANNE. 'Tis very true: 'Tis an ill thing when opposite seasons meet. ALFORD. And opposite ages are like spring and winter; 'Tis the spring suffers always in the encounter, And the gentler bows to the sterner influence. ANNE. My father made this match; he was his friend. Oh! let me think how much he was his friend Who married me, portionless, friendless! ALFORD. Madam! What is't you say? portionless! Where's the dower Might with your wealth of beauty hold compare? Portionless! why, the giving of yourself, Decked as you are with charms not of this earthâ Turn not away, I speak the common words Of all men, where your name is only utteredâ Was the bestowing of so great a gift, That, tho' he should make up Methusaleh's years, He ne'er could pay you for't. O Heaven! portionless! The peerless Greek that set the world in arms Ne'er fired the nations with such matchless beauty. To look on you alone is happiness, And he has called you hisâhis own! ANNE. My lord! ALFORD. Oh! pardon me, you do not knowâyou cannot Ev'n guessâwhat chords are thrilling in my breast, That have perforce been silent many a year. You never knew, and now 'tis useless all That you should know, the hopes, the dreams, the worship That once did shrine your image in my heartâ Hopes that had sickened till I thought them dead, And worship that should now be dumb for ever;â Yet 'tis impossible to hold one's peace And hear you thus decry your precious self. Portionless! friendless! If you were thus friendless, It more became him ne'er to make you look From him to others who no others have, To hold his place if he should fail to you. You have no brother, madam, nor no sister? ANNE. Not one of kin to me in the wide world. ALFORD. Yet 'tis not so, fair creature! say thou not That thou art friendless; every eye that sees thee, Each heart that feels thy sovereignty of beauty, Is friend and servant to thine excellence. Oh! honour me with such a blessed title, And call my life your own. ANNE. I thank you, sir: To-morrow you go hence, never again To hear my name, or look upon my face. Your proffers were most kind, could they stead me aught. ALFORD. Yet, oh! remember them! ANNE. Be sure I will; And let me pray one thing of youâyour silence On what this evening you have witnessed. ALFORD. Madam, Your will locks that within my lips. ANNE. Good night, sir! Ere you depart to-morrow I shall see you. ALFORD. Once more I shall be happy then. Good night, Sweet lady! and may pleasant dreams wait on you! [Exit Anne. I would I might but order those same dreams: 'Tis wonderful how much is worked by them. The unconscious reason thrust aside the while, Feelings and passions oft lay hold of us, Which, i' the waking hours of soberer judgment, Were hard withstood: not so in kindly sleepâ The spell lies soft upon the dreaming spirit, And the foe creeps into the slumbering stronghold, Whence daylight and its sterner thoughts can't drive it. Fair Mistress Anne, would I were Morpheus To-night for your sweet sake! How proud she is! The tow'r's so high, 'twill topple of itself; For wisdom says pride goes before a fall, And if decreed so, why, I cannot help it. Bless Mother Ingle! I will pension her, Though 'twere my last groat, for this good night's work. [Exit. Scene 3. A terrace before Winthrop's house. Night. Enter Anne. ANNE. Into the cool night air; my blood is thick With a strange melancholy; and in my heart A fluttering fear beats quick, then dies away In faint dim longings. What should all this mean? I'll walk i' the moonlightâit may be the chaste And solemn light of the starry heavens, together With the night's cool breathings, shall refresh my spirit. How bright thou art, ineffable lonely queen, That rul'st these silent hours! O me! my soul Melts in thy radiance! All things are at rest. From the still boughs that sleep beneath thine eye Faint odours breathe of the green and budding spring; No smallest sound is heard, but a low rustling Like the unfolding of the new made leaves. My husband sleeps; I watched him ere I left him; A dreamless quiet slumber it did seem, Like that of a good man. [Enter at the back Lord Alford. I'm glad I woke. My sleep was much disturbed, and in my dreams A voice and form arose for evermore, That seemed to draw my heart away from me; I'm glad I woke! How sad and fair is night! How fair were such a night to two who loved, Standing beneath this loving sky. Ah me! That mine had been so sweet a lot! Who's there? O Heaven! Who's there? ALFORD (coming forward). Start not, fair dame, nor fear. What, wandering thus a lonely votary Of the cold queen! Where is your happy husband, That he thus suffers you to steal away, To walk through the night a fairer earthly Dian? ANNE. How comes your lordship waking at this hour? I thought the house abed. ALFORD. Nay, how come you At such an hour awake? Alas! my eyes Refuse to close: my blood within my veins, Stirred by some unknown passion to and fro, Gushes and ebbs from my o'erladen heart, That heaves with smothered sighs. But what make you With restless wakefulness? You, in whose breast The sunshine of a calm content doth dwell, Whose wishes crowned with perfect happiness Rest in the joy of full accomplishment? ANNE. O Heaven! I!â ALFORD. Why, you are weeping, sure! Whence are these crystal tokens? ANNE. Sirâmy lordâ It is not fit, nor seemlyâ'tis not well, That thus in the night we should converse together. ALFORD. Why? was it sin when here you stood alone, Gazing into the heavens, like one dropt from them? And is it sin that, led by the beauteous night, And a secret spirit of most blessed chance, I here have met you? Nay, but if you were one Not bound in wedlock chain, but gently bent To hear me pleadâif I were one who loved youâ If kneeling thus, thus pressing this white hand, I prayed your mercyâ ANNE. Rise this instant, sir! You have forgot to whom you speakâforgot Yourself and meâin this audacious language. ALFORD. Pardon, oh, pardon!âon the earth I lie Prostrate before you. Call your husband hither, And bid him put his sword into my heart, But pierce it not with thy more terrible anger. ANNE. Hence, ere the night shall waste another second I may not look upon you once again, Nor hear you speak another syllable, Without a deadly sin. ALFORD. Forgiveâforgive me [Anne re-enters the chamber and closes the window; he remains kneeling as the scene closes. Scene 4. Enter Servants, crossing the stage with trunks. FIRST SERVANT. Are they up yet? SECOND SERVANT. They should be, for the cock Crew half an hour ago, and the dawn whitens. My lord said last night he would be in London To dinner. FIRST SERVANT. He must have good horses then. Be they saddled all? SECOND SERVANT. They are e'en at it now. The house is only now beginning to stir. Come, let's go get our breakfast, thou and I, Ere riding into town. Yonder's the Judge And Master Forrester; they'll start anon, And 'tis ill riding on an empty stomach. [Exeunt. [Enter James Forrester and Judge Winthrop. WINTHROP. All is concluded, Master Forrester, And I hope well righted to your brother's wish. Hereafter, should any troubles visit you, I shall be glad to straighten matters for you; Here are the parchments. JAMES. Thanks, most worthy sir! Yet I have still another cause on hand, Which, more than all, needs your indulgent help. WINTHROP. Speak and command me. JAMES. I have heard my brother Speak of you ever as the man in the world He loved the best, me only set aside. WINTHROP. Young sir, your brother is my worthy friend; I love him as a brotherâI might say A son, he is most excellent. JAMES. Then, sir, May I think you will not hold me over daring, If to fulfil a darling wish of his, And a hope on which my more than life depends, I ask if you will give to your friend's brother Your gentle sister?âGood sir! do but hear me! That I love her most dearly, oh, believe it! That she towards me inclines with kindly favour I dare to thinkâ WINTHROP. Why, surelyâsurely, sir, You would not have the heart to marry her? JAMES. Sir! WINTHROP. Sir, I cannot give that child away! You might as well ask me for half my heart! I cannot want herâI can't live without her! JAMES. Judge Winthrop, you amaze me! what, the good, And self-denying man, who still to all Deals merciful justice, for the single sake Of a mere fancied loss, denies his sister The happiness of a prosperous wedlock, and Condemns the man who loves her to a life Of bitterest disappointment; O sir, hear me! If, as I hope, your gentle sister loves meâ WINTHROP. Sir, 'tis impossible! I'm sure she cannot Love you! she oft has sworn to me, she never Should love a man, to have him for her husband. JAMES. Are you married, sir, and do not you yet know The cunning cloaks a maiden's humour wears Ere yet her fancy's touched? Nay, but believe me, I think I am not over bold, nor vain, To dream that Mistress Mary heeds my suit. Send for her, I beseech you, sir, and question her. WINTHROP. O Heaven! this is the way! a whole dear life They live upon our knees, and in our arms, The darlings of our very soulsâand lo! A stranger, passing by, but beckons them, And straight they turn their back upon their homes, And make their lodging in a new-found heart. Oh! I had dreamt of thisâbut it is bitter, Now that 'tis come to pass! JAMES. Good sir, take comfort! You shall not lose your sister, but instead, Gain a true loving brother, and we will live As near to youâ WINTHROP. Oh, sir! for eighteen years, We've lived together and asked no man's leave, And only thanked God for the blessing, sir! But you are right, for if she marries you, Henceforth you shall lend me her society, And I shall thank you for't; live near to me! My heart has been her house for eighteen years, And every thought a chamber that she dwelt in Perpetually! but now, if she lived 'neath my roof, Sat at my board, slept in the very bed That held her in her sleep last night, and walked Each day in her accustomed walks, I tell you, She would be gone from meâgone from me, sir; A husband is a wall that builds itself Between a woman and all other things. Like the young bird, in our hedge elm trees here, Warmed in the nest, he presently drives thence The ancient brood, who made their proper home there. If she is married, she is no more mine, No sister, nor no daughter, but a wife; All other names are clean forgot in that New nameâall other loves in that new love. JAMES. Well, sir, if she loves me, how shall it stead you That she still wish she were not where she is, Nor what she is, but married, and my wife? WINTHROP. That's true! poor wench! Pray, sir, have patience with me! 'Tis something sudden, and you seemed to me Little more welcome than a thief to a miser. Trueâas you sayâif she indeed doth love you, She's gone already beyond all redemption. Have you spoke of this matter to her yet? JAMES. Walking by twilight in the orchard, sir, Last evening, when I took my leave of her, My heart unsealed itself. WINTHROP. And what said she? JAMES. She bade me speak to you. WINTHROP. She did? JAMES. She did. WINTHROP. Within there! [Enter a Servant. Send my sister Mary hither. [Exit Servant. James Forrester, if this be as you think, If my dear sister loves you, you shall never Hear another word from me upon this matter. 'Tis woman's nature, Sir, and there's an end on't. You wrenched my heart something too suddenly, And I with little wisdom answered you. You are my dear friend's brother, if you make My sister happy, I will bless you and love you Above all men.âOh! if she love thee, youth, Treasure thou well the gift she gives to thee: A gentle, modest, virtuous, loving woman, Will make thy life on earth a paradise, And help thee far upon thy way to heaven. God help me! an it were her burial I scarce could feel more sadly. [Enter Mary. My sweet Mary! Give me thy hand, thus do I lay it fast In his, who asks thee of me for his wife. Start not, nor blush, nor tremble, nor deny, But simply, if thou art content to wed him, Take not thy hand away:âit is enough. MARY. Brother! WINTHROP. Why what's the matter? did he hold you So tight, you could not get your hand away? MARY. No, brother, butâ WINTHROP. Goâgoâgo. Hold thy peace! [Mary and James converse apart. [Enter at different doors Anne and Lord Alford. Good-morrow, wife. Good-morrow to your lordship! How did you rest last night? ALFORD. Indifferently, sir: A night so troubled I shall scarce forget it. (Aside.) She has not told her husband yet; good lady! WINTHROP. Indeed, I'm sorry for't. Was your lordship sick? ALFORD. Sick to the heart, sir. Gentle Mistress Winthrop, How fare you in this early hour o' the day? Your pillow scarcely will forgive us, that We draw you from it sooner than your wont. (Apart to her.) Have you forgotten and forgiven too? ANNE. My lordâIâIâ [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Your Lordship's horses wait. ANNE. Thank Heaven, at last! WINTHROP. Before you take your leave, Here is a piece of business toward, to which I wish your presence, as true witnesses. Here be two friends of ours, who have found out That marrying is a wise and pleasant thing. Heaven grant they prove it so! to their betrothment Testify with your best good wishes:âwife, Go, give my sister joy; and you, my lord, Pray greet your friend, who is to be my brother. ALFORD. Your hand, good James; may marriage be to you,â What yet I never heard it was to any man. WINTHROP. That's a court jest, sir: 'tis above our wits. In the country, we yet hold the grandam's saw, That marriage is a state both blest and honourable. ALFORD. (Aside)âThat's as may happen. (Aloud)âGood sir, pardon me! ANNE (to MARY). May'st thou be happy, dearest child! MARY. As happy As you are, Anne, and I shall be content. ALFORD. Umph! ANNE (aside). Will this end! WINTHROP. As for the wedding day, For that we wait your brother John's return. I'm sure you would not think yourself well married Unless he gave you joy. Clear up your brows, He must be back ere the next month goes by, And though you must remain in London now, And Mary here, you're free to waste between ye, As much good paper, pen and ink, and horse-shoes As you shall deem discreet. JAMES. A mortal month! We shall be sundered! WINTHROP. Pshaw! come, come, this parting Grows sad,âsome wine! [Enter a Servant. Your stirrup cup, my lord, Before you mount,âa bowl of Burgundy, Well spiced, and warmed, to keep the chill air out; And I myself will ride as far with you As the clump of oaks, where you strike the high road. ALFORD. Fair Mistress Winthrop, you're but ill at ease, I fear we have disturbed you all too early: You are pale, I think. WINTHROP. That fault is mended now, Your lordship sees. James Forrester, a word with you. ALFORD (aside to ANNE). Do not forget me quite!âI goâno more To look upon you; this is Paradise, And I, a wretch driv'n from its gates for ever! [Enter a Servant with a bowl of wine. WINTHROP. Now, wife, give you the morning draught to his lordship. What's the matter? ANNE. Nothing, sir, a careless stumble. WINTHROP. That wine's too good for earth libations, sweet; Walk heedfully! [Anne takes the cup to Lord Alford; he salutes her but does not drink. ALFORD. No wine after that kiss, I'm drunk already. ANNE. I shall sink with horror! [Alford giving the cup back to her gives her a small parcel. ALFORD. (Aside)âHush! do not let them see this; but sometimes, Look on it for my sake with pity. (Aloud)âMadam, We cannot speed but well, by you sent forth, And by your worthy husband guided hence. [Winthrop takes the cup from Anne and gives it to Mary. WINTHROP. Now, Mary, bid James Forrester good speed Toward London; when he comes this way there'll be No need to bid thee speed him with thy wishes. [Mary takes the cup and gives it to James. MARY. Farewell! may you speed quickly backâI meanâ To London! JAMES (kisses her cheek). Heaven bless and keep you, Mary! WINTHROP (after drinking). To horse! to horse! to brush the morning dew, And sniff the freshest air o' the day. Come, gentlemen. [Exeunt Winthrop, Forrester, and Alford. MARY. From the terrace we can see them as they ride Down to the linden trees; come Anne and watch them. [She opens the window and goes out. ANNE. They're gone at last, and I can breathe!âwhat's this? What's this? ah, traitor! dost thou doubt thy art? Think'st thou the image is not deep enough? Oh, eyes that have looked through me, do I yet Behold ye, fatal eyes, that have undone me! Lips! that the sweetest poison in the world Have poured into my heart, are ye yet here? What is't I do?âO Heaven! what is't I do? Am I a wife, and thus stand gazing on The picture of a man that's not my husband? Why, I am lost! he must have seen it too; Seen that I was not true, nor chaste, nor honest. How did he dare to leave his picture with me! How did he dare to think I thought of him! How did he dare!âoh, wherefore, should he not? What though I bury this down i' the earth, Smother it up fathoms deep i' the sea, Oh, what will that avail? he's here, he's here, Here in the hurried throbbing of my heart, Here, here within my bosom; God in Heaven! What will become of me? what shall I do, When back my husband comes? How shall I look When he looks on me? How answer him When he speaks to me? all the live-long day, How shall I hide my thoughts from him? at night If I should dream, or utter words in my sleep, What will become of me? MARY (from the terrace). What, are you coming, Anne? I see my brother turning home again. ANNE. Oh, horrible! Hide, hide thee close; O Heaven! it burns my heart. MARY (from the terrace). I shall run meet him,âwill you come along? ANNE. Would I might never see his face again! What did I say?âoh, I am lost for ever! [She runs out. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene 1. The park of Judge Winthrop, early morning. Enter Anne and Alford. ANNE. All's still as night; comeâyou may comeâcome quickly; I have spied carefully, there's no one near. ALFORD. Thanks, gentle guide! what, art thou turning back? Wilt thou not walk with me to the orchard wall? ANNE. I'm sick with fear! O Alford, get thee gone! Hark! what was that? ALFORD. Nothing; why how you tremble! A bird stirred in its sleep among the boughs. Why, how your heart is beating, and the blood All ebbing from your cheeks! ANNE. This is the joy of guilt! For mercy's sake, begone!âthe light is breaking In the east. See, there's a shadow moving yonder. ALFORD. Oh, you see shadows where there's nothing, love. ANNE. 'Tis very like; my eyes are full of fear. ALFORD. What should'st thou fear when I am near thee, sweet? ANNE. Everythingâyouâmyselfâmy husbandâGod. You laugh because I said that I feared God; Yet oh, 'tis true! I fear His dreadful justice; It will o'ertake us yetâbe sure it will! ALFORD. Why, thou'rt some pretty puritan, and not The gallant lady that Lord Alford loves. ANNE. Do you love me yet? is't possible you do? You will not love me longâyou will forsake me; What will become of me when you are weary of me! ALFORD. Fie! speak not thus! whene'er I love thee not, I live not either. Come, cheer up, my love, And look upon me brightly ere I go. ANNE. I know you do not love me as you used. You come less often, and you stay less long; You jest now when I weep, and you grow angry When I sigh, as I must do whene'er I think: Oh no, no, no: you will not love me long, And then what shall I do?âthen I must die! ALFORD. Pshaw! if I come less oft, or stay less long, 'Tis that you now for ever wear a face Of discontent and mortified repentance; As if the loving me were such a baseness As would degrade you. ANNE. Oh, my heart is breaking! You cannot, and you will not understand me. ALFORD. I do not understand these wintry looks, And these eternal self-upbraidings, madam. [Going. ANNE. O heav'ns! you're angry! Do not leave me thus. ALFORD. Nay, but I thought my presence might disturb you. I know not how thou art when I am hence, But when I'm here, you've nought but lamentations. ANNE. I'll tell thee how I am when thou art hence. The very moment that mine eyes lose sight of thee, Horrible darkness falls upon my life. One dismal, dreary winter spell comes o'er me, And save for a dim and dreamy sense of shame And terror that for ever dogs my steps, I seem no more alive;âeach word, each look Makes the guilty red roll hotly to my brows; I wake all night, weeping, till I grow sick; And if my heavy eyelids drop, I rise, And like a wicked spirit walk about, For fear lest I should sleep, and dream, and speak. Look at me, Alford! Do you see my eyes, How dim they look, and how my cheeks are fading? You cannot love the thing I am becoming. ALFORD. (Aside)âThere's truth in that. (Aloud)âOh, is it not yourself That have grown weary of our sweet communion? You do but jest to say that I am changed. You do not love me any more. ANNE. O Heaven! What shall I do? Alas! what's left to do, To prove my mad love for thee? Nothingânothing ALFORD. Yes, there is something yet, sweet Anne, to do. ANNE. Say what. I'll buy thy gratitude at least; That may outlive thy waning fancy. What? ALFORD. I have been playing deep, and am a loser Of heavy ventures. I am sore beset. ANNE. I have no money. ALFORD. But your husbandâ ANNE. What? Shall my husband's purse as well asâoh, no, no! You do not meanâyou're not in earnestâyouâ You do but jestâit is impossible! ALFORD. Unless I have to-night seven hundred pounds, To-morrow I shall bid adieu to England. I will not live to be lackeyed at the heels By ragged rascals, clamouring for their dues; I will begoneâ ANNE. Whither? ALFORD. In Italy Life's pleasant, or in France, and I will thither. ANNE. And what shall I do? ALFORD. Oh, make friends with your husband. ANNE. I was proud once! ALFORD. Hark! I hear footsteps coming. If I should never see you moreâ ANNE. O God! ALFORD. Farewellâ [Going. ANNE. What! Are you going thus! For ever! I will ask for the money, Alford,âyes, I will! ALFORD. I know for certain, that Judge Winthrop means To go from home for some few days, to-night. In a few hours hence I will again be with you, Thanks, gentle friend! farewell! but not for ever. [Exit. ANNE. My body's honour, and my soul's salvation, My peace of mind here, and heaven's joys hereafter, All, all are gone! for what? Why, he despises me. He's used me for his pleasure, and he now Will use me for his profit, for his purse. He loves me not!âhe soon will grow to loathe me; For where we wrong, there do we oftenest hate, And presently he'll leave me, throw me by; He'll never come again, nor ever think of me, But with an inward sneer; perhaps, he'll brag Of how he found Judge Winthrop's lady easy, And make a ribald table tale of me! I shall go mad! [Enter Mary. What, Mary, are you there? Have you been walking? I've been up, and stirring, With the early bees; you see I mend apace: The morning was so fair, andâandâmy spirits So light and joyful, that I thought I'd try How the dewy air of the grey hours tasted; andâ I came to walkâ [Enter Winthrop. MARY. Why, here's a miracle! Why, brother, here's our Lady Runaway Turned handmaid to the early morning star,â First gentlewoman of Aurora's bed-chamber, And blushing as her mistress. WINTHROP. How now, wife! What, truant, what! steal from me as I slept? What shall I think hath lured thee from my bed? Why, were I jealous, such unwonted wakefulness Might make me doubtâ ANNE. Doubt, sir! youâyouâyou could not. WINTHROP. What, will you answer me in earnest now? Yea then, I swear, I saw you meet the man, Andâ ANNE. Sir! WINTHROP. And part from himâ ANNE. Ha! ha! ha! ha! How merry is my husband this fair morning, To jest so much ere breaking of his fast! MARY. Nay, but I find you merrier than your wont; Do you not notice, brother, in her eyes An unaccustomed brightness, and a colour More red than usual in her cheeks? ANNE. Why sure, You would not have me rise at such an hour For nothing? Why, the profit's to our beauty, If, ere the sun gets up, we cheerly leave Our dreaming beds, and to the early light, And the fresh air, and sparkling dews of morning, Commend our faces; whatâyou see your homilies Are not lost on me; I can chatter, too, On wholesome exercises and good hours; Perhaps you thought that, being city-bred, I was incapable of all this wisdom? MARY. I scarcely thought thee apt at so much mirth; I do not know thee. ANNE. 'Tis the morning sun, Hath touched my forehead, and upon my spirits Worked a brisk spell. WINTHROP. Why, be it what it will, That to thy heart brings but one pleasant fancy, It has my thanks; for still thy mirth is mine, Thy pleasure and thy joy my best content, And what does thee a good does me a thousand. ANNE. (Aside)âO Heaven! (Aloud)âCome, I must test your love a little; IânoâI will not. WINTHROP. What's the matter, wench? ANNE. I thought to have asked you, since your love's so great. A proof of it. MARY. Now shall I learn to wheedle WINTHROP. Learn! oh you're perfect all of ye in that; Dame Nature, in your very swaddling clothes, Teaches ye that. Come, now, what is it, wife? ANNE. I fear you will deny me. WINTHROP. Nothing, sweet, That lies within my compass. What? ANNE (aside). My eyes Are filling fast with tears; I shall betray myself. WINTHROP. Come, Anne, take heart,âdo I deserve this pause? MARY. I would not bargain so to tax thy love. ANNE. No, you've no need. IâI would have some money,â SirâhusbandâI have need of such a sum As I most fear to nameâseven hundred pounds! MARY. Wilt thou build churches? This is wonderful! ANNE. Pray do not question me for what I want this; Pray do not say one word but yea or nay; Say no, I cannot have it,âsay so quickly! WINTHROP. Wife, you can have it; I have more than that Now in my hands, and it is freely yours. I do not ask you anything, but when You please to tell me how you need this money, I shall be glad to know it. Hitherto I have not known you wasteful or unthrifty; I'll think you have good cause for what you ask, And mean to put it to some worthy use. ANNE. This is too much! I will not take it, no. WINTHROP. Peace, peace, 'tis yours. Here is the key of my chest, Take that thou find'st therein, it will not reach To full seven hundred pounds, but go to my steward, And bid him pay the rest to thee. I know It is to do some holy act of charity, Which shall buy blessings out of heaven for us, That thou desirest this; it could not be Else that thou wert so close;âgive me a kiss! For I must ride from home some twenty miles, And shall not see thee for a day and night, So bid me speed. MARY. Why, Anne, what is the matter? You're growing deadly pale. ANNE. Oh, stay at home! Good husband, stay at home, to-day, at least! Oh, I beseech thee do not go away! No, do not go from home by any means! WINTHROP. Why, this is stranger than all things beside! Not go from home! not do my duty, Anne! 'Tis not the first time that I have been called Unwillingly enough, for a space to leave thee, But never yet have I been stayed with tears, And wringing hands. ANNE. Pray, do not go! pray, do not! MARY. Why say, what is it? Hast thou dreamt of him? Ill chances on the road? Did the death-watch tick? Or did your woman break a glass last night? ANNE. Well, I am mad! yet, husband, do not go! WINTHROP. Pray, Anne, don't try my virtue in this fashion. 'Tis hard enough still to be called away From you and home, by matters that in nothing Touch my own heart; but thus to have thee sue, And hang about me, and weep over me, Why, 'tis enough to melt a man's soul out of him. ANNE. I cannot help it. What, can you not stay? WINTHROP. So little, that the hour is even now When I must mount my horse; come, walk with me To the gate. ANNE. Will you not stay? WINTHROP. I cannot, Anne. ANNE (aside). 'Twas the last hope, and I had clutched at it In vain! MARY. Oh, come! I see 'tis I must play the hero, And swear to guard you well till he comes home. There shall no thief come in at our door, nor lover At our windows, brother, and so go in peace; I will look to your loving wife the while. [Exeunt. Scene 2. A tavern in London. Wilton, Mowbray, and others discovered at dice. MOWBRAY. Who saw him last? WILTON. Whom? MOWBRAY. Why, the pattern man; The eleventh commandment, by which people live In London; the Lord Alford. WILTON. Bless him! FIRST GENTLEMAN. Three days since I met with him, passing through Austin Friars He was in grave talk with an Israelite; I feared for the poor circumcised rascal; I thought he was no match for the gentleman. WILTON. Well, well, revenges will be had some day, And justice comes, though she be long a-coming. They say he's steep'd in debts to the very lips; An I were his creditor, I'd be like him i' the Bible, And hold him by the throat till all were paid. MOWBRAY. His estates are laden with more mortgages Than his oaks bear apples; yet he ruffles it For ever like a pageant through the town, And his need seems costlier than most men's wealth. WILTON. He hath means, sir, easy means. MOWBRAY. Hush, Wilton! SECOND GENTLEMAN. What, What means hath his lordship? WILTON. Oh, the devil knows! Not I. FIRST GENTLEMAN. Why, he's kept by half a score Of loving ladies who have loving lords; He borrows from their husbands several ways; He will not starve till he grows old or ugly. Yonder he comesâ WILTON. Then I'll begone. I love not To handle dice in his lordship's company. [Exit Wilton. [Enter Lord Alford. ALFORD. Good morrow, lads! Ha, still at the old work! Who's winning, and who's losing? Come, I'll be One of ye. Here be good seven hundred pounds I mean to lose, or double, presently. MOWBRAY. That's well, for Jew, or mistress! I will go Shares in your lordship's luck. FIRST GENTLEMAN. Then George and I Shall be your adversaries:ânow, my lord. ALFORD. Who saw James Forrester to-day?âsoâsoâ An excellent cast. MOWBRAY. I did; in merry humour, Going to meet his brother, the new baronet. FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do not see we touch that bag of gold yet: Your lordship has a spell for the dice, I think. ALFORD. Certainly, sir, I have. So Sir John Forrester Comes home to-day, does he? MOWBRAY. E'en now he should be landing. ALFORD. What manner of man is he?âlike James? MOWBRAY. Not much: Graver, and less acquainted with the world; A scholar, and a single-hearted man, Of excellent dispositions. ALFORD. Is he married? SECOND GENTLEMAN. Oh, no! he never found that perfect lady That he could love, they say. ALFORD. Indeed! There's the last cast: That finishes the game;âgood sirs, you're conquered. I beg your pardon humbly. Well, this gentleman, He's got this title lately? MOWBRAY. Ayeâand with it A fat round revenue of thirteen thousands Per year. ALFORD. That's too much for a bachelor. (Aside)âI would I might but once get hold of him, Easy, and rich, he were an income to me; Teaching such fools experience, we do give them Their money's worthâwisdom, that pearl of price, For what all wise men are agreed is trash. [Enter Servants, carrying in trunks, &amp;c. Enter Sir John and James Forrester. JOHN. No, no, I will not set my foot again Upon that most uneasy cradle. James, See thou to the rest; I'm no more for the water, My head is rocking yet; I'll keep the ground, The new-found earth, for a little while. JAMES. I go, And straight am back to you,âoh, welcome friend! Dear brother, welcome! [Exit. MOWBRAY. Welcome home again, Worthy Sir John. FIRST GENTLEMAN. Good sir, I greet you well! SECOND GENTLEMAN. You're very welcome back to England, sir! JOHN. Thank you, good gentlemen! your courtesy Is very gratefully received by me: And 'tis a happiness indeed, once more, To hear the pleasant tongue my mother spoke, And grasp an Englishman again by the hand. ALFORD. May I take leave to bid you welcome, sir, To your own country; wealthier, and more noble, In the world's common use of speech; but neither To those who knew your worth and true nobility. FORRESTER. Lord Alford, as I think? ALFORD. The same. FORRESTER. My lord, Your speech would make me blush, but that I know 'Tis a mere fashion thus to praise demerit, And courtesy, rather than truth, is thanked for it. ALFORD. Sir, I have long desired much to know you. FORRESTER. Your lordship does me honour. ALFORD. Not a whit; Myself much pleasure. Shall we sit, good sir? They may be tedious landing of your goods, You're doubtless weary? FORRESTER. Why, I thought I was, Till from the main into the river's course, Swoll'n with the briny mingling of the sea, We turned our prow; then, as the morning broke Upon the narrowing stream, and from each shore Up drew the misty curtains of the night, My senses, challenged by each several object Of welcome sight and sound, and smell of land, Grew brisk and wakeful; and the kindly greeting That met me here has given me rest already, Refreshing me with pleasure and content. MOWBRAY. We'll take our leave awhile; hereafter, sir, We shall be proud to wait upon your leisure. [Exeunt Mowbray and Gentlemen. ALFORD. Methinks good Master James has a long task; How shall we waste the time? Oh! here be diceâ D'ye play? FORRESTER. No, pardon me, I have not touched A die for many years. ALFORD. Rare abstinence! a vow, perhaps? FORRESTER. Even so, my lord, a vow. When but a boy, I threw, and won at once so large a stake, That I thought the devil must be bribing me To an ill course: and though so much the gainer, I never since have given him leave to tempt me. ALFORD. (Aside)âThis is some man come from before the flood: Who ever heard the like? (Aloud)âOh! you're to blame, I find these little squares rare playfellows; Your brother loves them well. FORRESTER. I fear, too well. [Lord Alford drops the dice; in stooping to pick them up a picture falls from his dress; Sir John Forrester picks it up. You have dropped something, sir; how beautiful!â Pray pardon me, my lord. ALFORD. Nay, look at it As much as you will: d'ye think it fair? FORRESTER. Oh, rare! Most rare! you must forgive me, my good lord,â Is there indeed a woman like to this? Or is't a cunning sport of the painter's fancy? It were great happiness to dream this face. ALFORD. Sir, 'tis no dream, but an indifferent copy Of a lady's face, whom I am well acquainted with. FORRESTER. You know her? ALFORD. Very well. FORRESTER. And is it possible She is as fair as this? ALFORD. As much more fair As life to death, and nature's workmanship, To the poor mimicry of art. These eyes, And brows; that rosy mouth, and golden hair, Are barren truths, which in the real woman, Inform'd by the light of life's most subtle magic, Become transfigured to a thing divine. FORRESTER. I can believe it; here it is, my Lord. ALFORD. Nay, do not stint yourself, if it pleases you;â Are you satisfied with gazing? FORRESTER (retaining the picture and looking at it). 'Twere unsafe Much longer to indulge such contemplationâ It seems to grow alive while I look at it. ALFORD. Why so it might. Would you care to know this lady? FORRESTER. I hardly care to own how much; you'll laugh, And I feel as if a witchcraft had possess'd me. It is most strange, but from these eyes a spell Unutterableâa sudden, irresistible charm Has seized upon my fancy; I shall offend you, But I'd giveâI know not whatâto know her. ALFORD (aside). Oh ho! there is a right string after all To make the puppet dance; why, she shall do it. (Aloud)âDon't break your heart; I think that I can say You shall see her. FORRESTER. How! ALFORD. And yet not pay that priceâ I mean âyou know not whatââfor the privilege. She might prove a dear beauty at that rate. FORRESTER. How say you? That I may see this lady? ALFORD. Certainly; And know her, and converse with her, and more If it so like you. FORRESTER. Indeed! I'm sorry for it! ALFORD. Sorry! for what? FORRESTER. That she is such an one, Methinks there shines a spirit in this face Of inward purity; how sweet and sad It is! Surely those heavenly eyes are not Lights that betray men's souls! ALFORD. I cry your mercy! Perhaps you have a vow too against this, And will not go with me to see this lady? FORRESTER. I've no such virtue in me I confess, But will be bounden to you to fulfil Your promise to me. That fair countenance Hath laid fast hold of my fancy. If that woman Has a priceâwhich yet 'tis pity that she has!â Though 'twere my best estate I think I'd give it To buy her favour ALFORD. Good Sir John, to-morrow You shall strike your bargain for yourself. FORRESTER. To-morrow! I did not think my first half day in England Could have seem'd so longâ ALFORD. See, where your brother comes, Let us go meet him. FORRESTER (returning the picture). You will certainly To-morrow let me see her? ALFORD. Certainly And if your speed in wooing match my wishes, To-morrow you may call that lady yours. [Exeunt. Scene 3. Anne's bedroom: she is discovered at the window. ANNE. The day goes down, and darkness comes apace, To muffle up the wickedness and woe That the light looks on. O that never more Morning might rise upon the earth! that this Fast gathering gloom might henceforth shroud the world, And wrap my shame and sorrow up for ever! But the hours will go upon their ceaseless errand; The night will fold her wings, and rising up Leave on the earth a new-hatch'd day of misery. And I must wake from sleep, and feel my heart Clutch'd by remorse and fear ere well I wake; My dismal and inseparable fellows, That still lie down, and still rise up with me. And I am strong and youngâgreat God!âand I Must live through many, many, many days, Before I die! Far down through the darkening fields The river runs; deep, deep, and fast it runs, And underneath each wave of it there lies A bed for death. A moaning voice comes to me, Calling me to lie down and sleep beneath That glassy coverlidâit were soon done. No more to fear; no more to think and suffer; No more to know; no more to recollect. O blessed fate! no more to recollect! I'll do it: it grows nightâno one will see me; And far, far, when the cruel morning breaks, My body will go tumbling on the waters To the great seaâand where shall be my soul? O terrible thought! I shall not die in drowning. 'Tis not my body suffers and remembers; It is my soul, and that shall live for ever! Perchance, too, as I leapt into the waters The love of life might rush into my heart; And while the choking waves were smothering me, The sun, the light, might rise before my eyes, And I might long to live; and if I call'd, 'Tis night, and none would hear: my husband's far, And he is far. Oh, my heart dies away, To think of him whom I did love so madly, Whom now I fear and loathe so utterly!â There was a sound without! Sure I heard footsteps, And a rustling motion near,âO Heaven! 'tis he. Oh, I am sick with horror! [Enter at the window Alford. ALFORD. Ha, fair mistress! You look'd like a star in the grey evening light; You tremble, lady. ANNE. Youâyou make me shudder. ALFORD. Shudderâthat's cold! trembling is not so cold: You used to tremble when I met you first, When first we spake, when first our fingers clasp'd; But that was trembling full of blushes,âwarm, And not like this cold loathing death shiver. What, you're not merry! What's the matter, sweetheart? ANNE. I am not merry! faith, 'tis strange I am not, Having such cause! here do I stand beside My husband's bed; here, in this sacred chamber, To marriage vows holy and dedicate; I, the most foul and falsest wife alive, And you, whose arts have made me what I am, The wretch, the creeping, starting, guilty wretchâ In faith, 'tis strange I am not merrier! ALFORD. Why come, you please me better now,â that's right! I love to hear you talk, 'twill ease your heart too; And for my part, I am willing to be rail'd at. Luckily, ladies' scolding breaks no bones, I should have scarcely had a whole one else Anon you'll fall to weeping and be well: Come, is it over? ANNE. Give me patience, Heaven! To think is madness!âI, that was once so happy, So good, so fair, so innocent,âand now! And dost thou never think? hast thou no moment, Not given up to wickedness, when thought Lays hold of thee? Dost thou sometimes remember, In the night, when sleep neglects to visit thee, Or in some sudden pauses of thy passions, Dost thou sometimes remember what I was, And what thou'st made me? ALFORD. We've been often happy Together, I remember that. ANNE. Oh, never! Never, so hear me God! have I been happy, While sinning with thee. One distracted dream Of passion, and of guilt, of wild delusion And horrible remorse, and clinging dread, Of shame, that eats into my very soul, This has been all my happiness with thee; The damned need not have envied it! ALFORD. Come, come; You have left out some pleasant hours we've had. I thought them pleasant, so did you too once. ANNE. Utter them not! Yet are they register'd Eternally in the great doomsday book; Thence can no tears or prayers wipe them away; They're there,âand thou and I shall read them there, Before the whole assembled universe, Upon the judgment day. ALFORD. Why, so we shall then: In the meantime, since neither tears nor prayers Can wipe them out, think thou no more of them, But rather let us study to make sweet This pleasant present life, nor heed the next. Leave walking up and down so hurriedly. ANNE. Alas! 'tis thus with me for ever! rest I know not, save in constant restlessness, Nor joy save in my tears, nor hope, save in My deep despair. ALFORD. Come sit ye down by me. ANNE. Oh, leave me! do not touch me, Alford! I know Your little hour of love for me is past: You have possess'd me, you have conquer'd me; Such beauty as I had has been your prize; My virtue and my peace are all your booty; Your triumph's full,âyou've done with me; for mercy Have done with me indeed! and never more Come hither where there's nothing left to tempt you; Oh, let me go! ALFORD. Come, come, I say you shall; What, coy with me? oh, pshaw! 'tis past the time. Sit down: I've something I would say to you. ANNE. Be brief, or I shall grow to stone. ALFORD. 'Tis pity now That you should weep so much; your eyes were bright When first I saw themâthey were like the stars. ANNE. Have pity on me, Alford! ALFORD. Then your hairâ It was not wont to hang dishevell'd thus: Fie! it looks slovenly; where are the braids, The golden links, the shining glossy curls, The billowy, glorious waves of floating hair, That caught my fancy? ANNE. You are mocking meâ I am so miserableâI know you are; And yet, I cannot think why you should torture me So cruelly. ALFORD. Why, you were wont to be so brave, That none came near you in your costliness; I'd have you be the woman that you were. ANNE. Make me that woman, thou who hast unmade me; Do it, oh, do it, if thou canst! ALFORD. Nay, hear me. I'd have you look the laughing, lovely dame, That once you look'd. ANNE. Wherefore? ALFORD. You're fair enough Yet to catch hearts. ANNE. What mean you? ALFORD. And although We two be no more lovers, there be some Who would give much to win your favour, lady. ANNE. If thou wouldst have me not go mad at once, Look not, and speak not thus, but let me go! ALFORD. No, no, you shall not go. I am a suitor to you; Not for myself indeed, yet I have hope That as I once prevail'd, another may Prevail, for my sake, with you. ANNE. What? ALFORD. Have patience! ANNE. I will not hear! ALFORD. Oh yes, you will, and do it: So hearken now, and leave this fooling, mistress! I have a friend, a man whom I know well, Who's a large fortune,âdo you hear me? ANNE. Yes. ALFORD. Well, then, you know that I have no estate, Nothing wherewith t'uphold the goodly show I make, save debts that have been made by it. You know this. ANNE. Yes. ALFORD. Good now, here's this to do: Receive this man, this fool, this friend of mine. Start not! but hear me: he is mad for thee! A goodly fellow too, handsome, and tall; This shall advantage thee, and from his wealth We will together draw advantages; For the which thou'lt pay him in the easy coin Of kisses, and sweet looks. What, hast thou heard me?â Art deaf? art dumb? art stone? art dead? ANNE. O God! I'm choking! Can I not get from hence! O Alford! Upon my knees, I beg, I do implore thee, Make me not do this horrible wickedness! By all that I have sacrificed to thee, By any hope of good, or fear of evil, Thou mayst acknowledge, make me not do this. I, whom thou once didst feign to love and worship; I kiss thy feet, trample upon me, kill me, Spit on me, spurn me, only spare me this! ALFORD. Go to! you're mad! Get up and listen to me! What more in loving him than loving me? ANNE. But him I do not know. ALFORD. Pshaw! never mind; You'll make acquaintance with him presently. ANNE. Hear me, you man! I'm an adulteress, A branded thing, for honest men to scorn, And true wives to cry out on. This I know; I do not wink at mine iniquity, It glares upon me full, and it is monstrous! But, if thou deem'st I am that shameless creature, To turn from man to man, and sell my body For price of money, 'tis not so I tell thee! I loved thee, idiot! idiot that I was! But I am not a common harlot yet! ALFORD. Another storm, and then another shower, And then a little while of sunny weather. What dost thou think that I intend to do, If thou deniest me? ANNE. Do thy worst, and spare not Thou'lt tell my husbandânay, I'll be before thee. Let him but once return, and I lay down The heavy load of all my sins before him; If he do strike me dead, I'll bless him for't. ALFORD. And leave him, too, a fair inheritance, A goodly name thro' all the country side, A precious title added to his Judgeship. Now, I am not so high heroical To wish your husband's fair fame branded thus; Methinks 'twere pity that the good Judge Winthrop Should be a scoffing mark in the public streets. And tho' if you were dead, you might not hear it; You leave your husband but an ugly name. ANNE. O God, preserve me! I shall sure run mad. What will become of me? ALFORD. Oh, why you'll be The whole world's wonder for your truth-telling. ANNE. Devil! be quick and say what I must do? ALFORD. Write straight, and hither bid this gentleman. ANNE. When must I bid him? ALFORD. Bid him come to-morrow. ANNE. How must he come? ALFORD. Oh, by our own old wayâ The yew-tree path, by the mossy orchard wall. ANNE. Shall he come that way? and will you show it him? ALFORD. I will; and now that you're so reasonable, I will do more. He does not know your name, Nor who you are, nor aught concerning you; I'll bring him blindfold hither, and if you Keep your own counsel, your good name may stand As fair as ever. So farewell! ANNE. I thank you. [She faints on the ground: he goes out. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene 1. Anne's bedchamberâearly morning. She is lying asleep on the bed. ANNE. Oh, mercy, husband, mercy! do not murder me! Alford, help, help meâI am drowning! Oh, Thank Heaven! thank Heaven! I am awakeâalive. My husband does not know; I am not drowning; 'Tis daylight once again, and all is well. That's falseâall is not well; I know it is not, Yet do not recollect what is amiss. Let's seeâlet's see! I dreamt my husband came, And frowning, thrust a knife into my heart. I felt the cold sharp point of the steel go thro' me, And then a heap of rushing waves came over me, And I was chokingâand upon the bank There stood a devil laughing, with the eyes Ofâofâwhy, what? was he not here last night? Last night! Was that a dream? Stood I not here, Lost in tremendous thoughts of sin and death, And came there not that manâthat devilâwho bade me Stoop to the vilest shame that ere tongue utter'd, Or thought conceived? Why, was that true indeed! Did I consent, is't possible I did! Is't possible, that hereâthat nowâe'en nowâ He may be coming,ânay, he may be come! Oh! no, no, never! no, it is not true; It was some hideous fancy, which in the night Took up the wretched dreamings of the day, And wrought it into shape. O Heaven! nor night Nor day to taste of rest! but this most certainly Was a bad dreamâno doubt, an evil dream. Nought elseânought else. [She goes to the window; enter Sir John Forrester. Oh, God! no! it was true. FORRESTER. I come not unexpected, nor unbidden, O fairest lady! wherefore start you, then? See, in my hand I hold the gracious words That gave me leave to look upon your beauty, And make my eyes and heart its slaves for ever. ANNE. Where am I fallen! FORRESTER. Oh, turn not thus away! In nought have I deserved such cold reproof, Save daring to admire you; yet yourself In gentle bidding writ that I should come, And I have flown. Nor was your hest forgotten; I have not raised audacious hands, to draw The curtain you have folded round yourself; Blindfold, e'en as you bade, I here was brought; I do not know the happy path that leads To where you dwell,âI do not know your name, Nor e'en the very house that holds you;ânow, This instant, in a chamber close at hand, Were my eyes loosed from this enforced darkness, And I stand dazzled as before the sun. Look on me, lovely lady, that I may Believe the image stamp'd upon my heart, From the cold tablet of your counterfeit ANNE. I cannot breathe,âI sink with shame! FORRESTER. 'Tis strange, So coy a bearing! Nay, I woo too coldly; And in your heart I know you laugh at me, That I stand tamely gazing at you thus, Nor seek to win you to a softer mood, With more importunate wooing. Come, be kind As you are fair, nor with cold winter now Freeze up the hopes yourself have made to spring; You did not summon me to mock at me. Sweet one! let me touch your handâ ANNE. O Heaven! Stand from me! let me go! FORRESTER. How now, fair dame? ANNE. For mercy's sake, sir! FORRESTER. Trembling, and in tears! ANNE. If you have yet a mother, for her sake! If you've a virtuous sister! FORRESTER. Why, what's here! Upon your finger a ringâa wedding ring! Your gay attire, your blooming youth, forbid To think you are a widow;âis it possible You areâ? ANNE. A wife! a wicked, wicked wife! The shame and curse of a trusting noble husband. O sir, if ever in your heart you held The image of a chaste and holy woman, If yet the honour'd life or memory Of her who bore you lives within your mind, If ever you desire to win a wife, Whose love shall be a sacred sanctuary, Open to you alone;âif e'er in woman You hope for honour or for happiness, Now turn from this foul suit, nor seek to sink Yet deeper in iniquity a wretch So lost as I!âfor manhood's sake forbear! Stretch not the advantage that you have o'er me; Have pity, sir! have pity! FORRESTER. How deep we go In the first step we take in sin, we know not. Rise, lady! nor to such humility Stoop that fair form. What shall I say to you? You have no need to pray me to forbear; Were you the fairest she that ever lived, And I more madly lost in love with you, Than ever man with woman was before, Here is a spell of power to exorcise The devil of unchaste thoughts and wild desires, And make me blush I ever had such toward you. And did the fellow of this wedded hand Write this? ANNE. Nay, I will tell you all,âyes, all, And trust your nobleness to pity me. The man that brought you here found in my heart An evil spot, which he hath spread so large, That 'tis a plague infecting my whole body. From the chaste duties of a wife I fell, Lured by his arts, therefore I stand before you, Bow'd down with shame, with sorrow, and repentance. O worthy sir, forbear to spit on me, But leave me mercifully, and forget That e'er you saw or spoke with such a creature. FORRESTER. Double-dyed villain! but that dear respect Of you and your sad secret hold me back, I would requite these goodly dealings presently. ANNE. For Heaven's sake do not so! My husband yet Knows not my guilt; and in the world's eye still I am honour'd; do not tear away the veil That keeps me from one universal hiss; Say nothing,âoh, say nothing, but begone! FORRESTER. I will begone: I now perceive how far The giving way to a licentious wish Might have betray'd me into sinning. Madam, Your beauty, which awoke those thoughts in me, Now teaches me to feel you have but stray'd Into sin's confines, and will straight turn back; For good is sure your proper element. You were not deck'd thus rarely, to become A snare to those who look on you, but rather, Believe it, and return to your right office, To make all men in love with excellence, Made fairer by your perfect loveliness. Pardon me, gentle lady! but these tears, These gracious drops, now falling from your eyes, Make bold my heart with virtuous love for you. Oh, trust your husband! do not any more Deceive him, but with noble courage, seek Forgiveness first from him, and then from Heaven. Farewell, for ever! as I came, I go: To the detested guidance of your enemy I must commit myself, and bear awhile His fellowship, with what patience I best may. Blindfold, I will retrace my steps, nor seek To know aught more than you have deign'd to tell me. And be you sure of this, if e'er hereafter I should encounter you, here or elsewhereâ As such a chance, perhaps, might yet befall meâ Neither by word, or look, or slightest sign, Shall you be made to recollect by me That ever I beheld your face before. And so, farewell! ANNE. The blessings of a soul Turn'd back from sinning, dwell with you for ever! [Exit Forrester. Scene changes. Scene 2. Garden of Judge Winthrop's house. Mary discovered. MARY. The blossoms are all gone,âhow soon they pass'd! And now already can I spy the round And downy shape of the half-formed fruit. It looks no more so fair, nor smells so sweet, Yet it has grown more worth; and the husbandman, Tells how the promise of the flowers was true. Methinks this tree speaks as a living voice, And such a lesson as a maid may hearken to, Who loves and dreams of marriage. It is now With us, in our sweet hopes, and happy dreams, The very hour of pleasant blossoming. Love, joy, and youth, within our bosoms make A sunny May-day; but the tree is full, Full flush'd with flowers, all open, all wide blown. Then what comes next? that they must fall,â'tis pity! So turn we to the graver days of life, Full of the sober happiness of duty; And in the ripening sun of time, we grow To a goodly prosperous autumn,âand what then? Shall it be winter ever in our hearts? O tree! how soon thou hast shed thy pleasant crown, Which, ere thou wear again, thy fruit must drop, Thy leaves grow withered, and thy sap run cold, And thou be pinch'd in a stern and barren winter. But not to such conclusion need we come, While Love's sweet flower yet lives within our hearts, And all our mellow golden autumn fruits Are stored for the empty days which we will fill With happy memories and blessed hopes. [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Madam, from the fern knoll I can see Eustace Hard riding to the house; the post is in. [Exit Servant. MARY. Oh, he brings letters! Oh, he is too happy, To hold in his hands the precious words of love That make my heart dance! [Enter Anne. ANNE. Here's your letter, Mary. Oh, how your blood reads from your cheek this writing! Will you not look inside? MARY. I am afraid; The sight of the mere paper is a blessing, But what's within I know not. ANNE. Shall I read it For you? MARY. No, you shall not,âI thank you. ANNE. Here's one for my husband, in a character I do not know,âand here is one from him. MARY (reading her letter). O Heavens! ANNE (reading her letter). What's the matter? Why, my husband Must be e'en now at the gates; for this was writ Yesterday, saying that he comes to-morrow, By early morning;âwhat's the matter, Mary? Ill news? say, dear,âis Master Forrester sick? Hath aught befallen him? MARY. Oh, me! that ever We should let steal our hearts out of our breasts, And trust them in such cruel, careless keeping! Thoughtless and thriftless! ANNE. What? MARY. He writes me here, That dicing two nights back with the Lord Alfordâ I hate that man! I always hated him! From the first I thought he looked a very villain, And now he's proved so! ANNE. What of him? go on. MARY. James Forrester has lost so deeply to him, That he says he knows not how he e'er shall answer it, Or when in this, his fortune's shatter'd plight, He can fulfil his word, and marry me. Oh! I was happy, happy, and contented Before I knew him; but my peace is gone, Gone, and for ever. This it is to love! ANNE. Oh, cheer thee, wench! the mischief may not be So great; his brother's wealthyâ MARY. What of that? Shall his honourable brother bear the charge Of his dishonest ventures?â'tis dishonest To venture what one cannot want. ANNE. Lord Alford Is his friend, and peradventureâ MARY. More's the pity That he's his friend! and is it a friend's office To let him play himself beyond his depth, And turn from friend to creditor? Out on it! Is this the dealing of a friend or gentleman! ANNE. He will remit the debt, no doubt of it. MARY. But I do doubt it; and what if he did? That's looking at the end, and not the action. If he forgave him fifty fold his debt, Does that undo his having risk'd so much? Besides, I'm sure he will do no such thing. ANNE. Why are you sure? MARY. Because, from every word I ever heard him speak, I judge him false. I never could abide the look of his eyes; But you, now I bethink me, seem'd to like him. ANNE. Who, I!â MARY. I thought you did, and marvell'd at it. For you had heard, as well as I, the tales Of wickedness, that ever, like foul shadows, Follow'd his name; you knew his bad renown; I wonder that my brother ever suffer'd him, Or Master Forrester could call him friend. ANNE. You judge him hardlyâ MARY. Can he be so judged? What, a heartless thief, who to the honest man That opes his door to him holds out his hand, And with the other stabs him in the back. The cowardly tempter of frail women, one Whose noblest trophies are a foul disgrace To a true-born gentleman;âI would have such Whipp'd through the land, as they do by common felons, For daring so to smirch the name he bears, The honour'd name of an English lord. ANNE. Good Heaven! How like you look to your brother! MARY. Oh! I am wrought beyond myself. Alas! and 'tis Another who hath raised this tempest in me. I am no more mine own! another's fate Moves me to weep or smile; another's deeds Make me rejoice or mourn,âthis 'tis to love! Two months agone what matter'd, what cared I Who play'd, or who forbore, who lost, or won? My thoughts ne'er wander'd from this pleasant home Of cheerful, sweet monotony; but nowâ A man has carried hence my heart with him; I am in London, I am no more here, And all save him is nothing; this it is To love! ANNE. Poor child! she weeps! her tears Are like clear drops from an overbrimming fountain, Freshening whereon they fall; she does not know, The tears that from the black well of remorse Distil their bitter poison down one's cheeks, Blistering and scorching furrows in one's soul. Weep not, dear Mary. MARY. No,â'tis of no avail. I will not weep; I will have patience, sister. Sweet patience will come comfort me. My flowers Look sick and silly, and I care for them no more; But I'll go walk among them, and take counsel Of their meek bowing when the hail-storms beat them. Upon the road I hear the grating wheels; 'Tis my brother; I shall go, for if he sees My eyes so red, he will be wroth, I know, And speak hard words of Master Forrester, And that would be the worst to bear of all. [Exit Mary. ANNE. Oh, pure in spirit! as she passes by me My heart shrinks back, instinct with its own foulness, From her clear presence. Now my husband comes, And I must utter all. Good Heaven, support me! WINTHROP (without). What, wife! ho, wife! ANNE. I cannot; I shall die! I cannot now; some other time I will. [Enter Winthrop. WINTHROP. Dear wife! dear Anne! oh, I grow young again, Whene'er from absence I return to thee! Sweet is the air around one's home, and sweet The light that shines upon it, and more sweet The faithful love that, like a holy lamp, Burns night and day within its sanctuary! ANNE. Good husband, welcome back! WINTHROP. As I rode up The park, and o'er the lawny slopes, and through The spreading chestnuts saw our pleasant house, And thought within myself how you and Mary Were waiting my return with loving eyes, Oft looking toward my coming, beck'ning me With your fond wishesâoh! I bless'd my God Who made me capable of love, and gave me Such precious things to spend that love upon. Draw not away thine hands, nor drop thy lids; But fix those eyes, clear windows of thy soul, And my most comfortable stars, upon me. O Anne! ANNE. What are you thinking of? WINTHROP. O wife! How savage and how wild a deed is hers, That woman's, who, with cursed and cruel hands, Shatters the crystal vial of her faith, And on the stony paths of life throws forth Her husband's honour, peace, and happiness, To bleed to death; oh! 'tis a sin unransom'd! ANNE. O Heavens! what put that thought into your head? WINTHROP. The sense of mine own wealth; the sight of thee, My treasure! and the dismal fate of one, A man I've seen of late, who hath been thus spoil'd By the familiar devil that lay in his breast, His wifeânay, but this story moves thee more Than I could wishâwhat, pale, and trembling, love! Come cheer, come cheer, let's speak of something else. Where is the child? where is my darling Mary? ANNE. She has gone heavily into the house With a letter from James Forrester. WINTHROP. Ha! poor wench! She's yet to prove the wise man's saying trueâ Who loves and longs in a single day grows old. But what's the news? ill news? ANNE. I scarcely know, She'll tell you all anon; here's a letter come for you, I have something crush'd itâ WINTHROP. Let us see, my dame. Ho, wife, here is brave news! Hark thee, good Anne, Hie thee, and presently deck up the best guest chamber, Let the damask hangings be spread all around it, And stick fair branches of the early flowers Aboutâand strew the ground with lavender, And lay the fine holland woof upon the bed. My dearest friend, a man you've heard me speak of For ever with good words, comes here to-day; He writes me thus:ââStrange chances, to be told Hereafter, when we meet, have brought me now, Within six miles of you; and so I purpose, As soon as that six miles may be gone o'er, To lodge beneath your roof a night.â Dear Anne, This is John Forrester, whose name you know, The one true friend good Heaven has blest me with. Go in, dear, and make ready with best speed, And with our primest cheer and warmest welcome Prepare all things. Oh, I'm merry, dear; He hath yet to know thee, yet to see thee, Anne. I have commended thee full oft to him, And wish'd he could but know how happily I was wived; make thyself brave, and show I was no braggart. ANNE. I shall do my best, sir. [Exit Anne. WINTHROP. Let's see, six years, come Martinmas six years, Since last we met; and he hath grown a baronet, And I have married, and a thousand things To gossip on have pass'd since then. I marvel What chance he hints at brings him hitherwards; The late Sir John's estates lie not this way; He says no word of James, nor of the news Mary has gotten from him; well, well, well, 'Twill all be told 'twixt this and eventide. Ho! Walter! [Enter Servant. Get thee to the cellarage, And draw from the best butt of Burgundy, And let me have sack of the eldest Sherris, And bid them lay before the fire the haunch Of the lusty buck, brought in o'Tuesday last. We will have cheer, and rouse. [Exit Servant. And if he's got A title and estates, I have a wife, A fair young wife! [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. One Sir John Forrester would see your worship. WINTHROP. Where is he? SERVANT. Here at hand, sir, but new lighted; He follows on my heels. WINTHROP. Oh, bring him straight! [Exit Servant. Re-enter with Sir John Forrester. WINTHROP. Welcome, thrice welcome, and again most welcome, Good John! Sir John, for new-made honour Loves its own name. FORRESTER. The man who once Hath call'd you friend can find no better title, My worthy friend and master. WINTHROP. Heart of gold! Give me your hand; it warms my blood to see you Once more at home, in this my home. FORRESTER. It looks Most pleasantly, and lovingly, dear Winthrop! In its new green; the old trees, with their limbs Not hidden yet by their tender veil of leaves. How happy I have been here! WINTHROP. And you shall Be just as happy. FORRESTER. You are married now. WINTHROP. What then! you are no raking, mad companion, Such as good housewives hate, who waste the night Draining of wine-pledges; and my good wife Loves me enough to love my friends right heartily. FORRESTER. 'Tis strange you should be married! WINTHROP. Why, I've writ Often enough to thee about the matter To make it no more strange. Why, you look gravely. Are you weary with your riding? FORRESTER. Not a whit. WINTHROP. Yet you look gravely. Adso! tell me now What chance 'twas brought you near me, that you writ of. FORRESTER. If I look gravely, 'tis that very chance. 'Tis a close secret, not mine own to tell, But a lady's. WINTHROP. Ha, lad! sits the wind that way? Art thou for wiving too? FORRESTER. I never Was further from it yet. No, I do think, If a wedlock prosperous beyond my hope, In the virtue, beauty, nobleness, and wealth Of a bride were offer'd me, I should turn loathing from it As though in my wine-cup I should spy a toad. WINTHROP. Why, what's the matter? FORRESTER. Oh! I have seen the inside Of such a thing! the seamy, foul inside Of what was held, is held, a prosperous wedlock. I have seen that which, while I live, I think, Will make my heart heave at the thought of marrying. WINTHROP. Why this is strange! You make me muse: e'en now I have returned home from a sad errand, Between a noble pair about to part, The lady having past all mercy sinn'd, And wreck'd by her ill-government the vessel Of their whole lives' peace. Can it be possible This plague is growing with us? FORRESTER. God forbid! And once again I say it, God forbid! Not in her stormy girdle of proud waves, Not in the rugged ramparts of her rocks, Not in the winged fleets that fly around her, Guarding her watery gates, lies the defence Of our dear country; but within her homes, The virtue and the truth upgarner'd there, Lives the right strength of England. Let but once Rottenness creep to this, the inward core Of all true bravery, and we are nothing. O my dear country! dearer now that I Return from foreign lands, to breathe again Thy purer airâfar be the day from thee, When the vile pest of strange licentiousness, Shall, like a poison, course within thy veins, Tainting thy wholesome body, and taking from thee The crown that thou hast worn since the first day The sea did homage to thy milky cliffs, Emblems of power and purity within! WINTHROP. Well pray'd, good Englishman; amen! and now Let's brush away these ill thoughts from our minds: Let's not, for one deceitful marriage, think All marriages accurst,âI cannot think so; And hope again to make revive in thee The honourable esteem thou once hadst for it. That I am married moves your marvel, Forrester; You will be wider yet amazed, to hear My wife is little more than half my years; She might have been my daughter. Shall I tell you Of her beauty? No, you will see her presently. Of her virtuous excellence, and modest worth, Her noble gentleness, her temperate pride, Her loftiness of spirit, that gives her the mien And gait of a sovereign queen? My good young friend, Think not I doteâmy life has found its crown In a fair womanâoh! such a woman, John! By heaven! I am ashamed to speak my mind of her, Or tell another man, how high I rate My wifeâ FORRESTER. I am impatient to behold her. [Enter Mary. Is this your lady? No, this is your sister, For softened in each feature, I behold The image of your face. Your sister, Winthrop, Is a fair glass, reflecting back yourself. Lady, by your leave! WINTHROP. She has clean forgotten thee. Will you not ask Sir John after his brother? But you care nothing for him; I remember, You heed not how he fares, you will not ask; So tell me, when comes Master James among us? FORRESTER. I hope in two days hence. Sweet Mistress Mary, I was your playfellow once on a while; My brother holds a happier fellowship with you. WINTHROP. But come, come, come, 'tis dinner-time, ha, wife! [Enter Anne. Are you come at last! Now, sir, here is the lady. Anne, this is Sir John Forrester, my friend; So bid him welcome to my house, sweet Anne. ANNE. You are very welcome!â WINTHROP. What's the matter? ANNE. Nothing: You are very welcome to my husband's house. FORRESTER. As your husband's friend, fair madam, let me thank you, And call myself yours as well as his. WINTHROP. Come in; I have ridden hard, and have a stomach brooks not Too much nice ceremony. Forrester, come, Take in my lady, and do thou, sweet Mary, Give me thy handâha, fie! 'tis given already; But let's go in to dinner for all that. [Exeunt omnes. Scene 3. A room in Judge Winthrop's house. Servants carry in dishes, and place them on the table. Enter Forrester and Anne, Winthrop and Mary; they seat themselves. WINTHROP. For his good gifts be the Lord thank'd! Now wife, Fall to, and let us eat. What, you look gravely; And you too, Forrester, wear yet a cloud More dark than was before upon your brow, And Mary mopes for companyâor lack of it. Come, fill your glasses, I will give you a pledge; Fill to the brim! the present and the absent! I'm sorry I'm the only one amongst you That seems in humour with my dinner. FORRESTER. This is A pleasant house, madam, that you live in here; Yon sloping upland, crowned with leafy garlands Of rocking woods, and that clear brimming river, Make a perpetual pageant to the eye. Is that water deep? ANNE. Yesânoâ WINTHROP. Ay, deep enough To drown thee, little wife, if thou should'st try it. MARY. You do not eat, sir, WINTHROP. No, nor drink. FORRESTER. One might Be happy here. WINTHROP. One might! aye, and one is. I'll say it, though my wife will not; is one not Happy here, Anne? ANNE. I hope you're happy, sir. FORRESTER. Like one athirst, who buries all his head In the cup from which he drinks, nor breathes, nor stirs, Till he has drain'd to the very end; so we, Quaffing sweet happiness, raise not our eyes Over the brim to look beyond. WINTHROP. How now! How now! I wear the grey hair here, yet I Alone am merry; why, my friend, is it A sin to thank Heaven for my blessings? FORRESTER. No; But they are Heaven's, not yours, remember it. WINTHROP. Why you amaze me! shall I look around, And see my life crown'd with each several joy That life may hold, and which for the most part Are singly dealt to mortals, nor combined Upon one head; shall I be rich, and honour'd, And loved, nor know it, nor be thankful for it! Go to! 'tis not thy grave face or grave words Shall fright me from my mirth; and still I say, There breathes no happier man in England now, In Englandâin the world than I am! [Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Sir, A rider who just spurred to the gate, threw this Into my hands, and straight across the park Gallop'd in foaming haste, shouting me back, To put it in your worship's handsânone other. It must be very urgent, for his horse Was smoking with his speed, and from his mouth Flew the white foam flakes, and his nostrils puff'd With snorting breath the air, while his vein'd sides, All dark with sweat, panted beneath his rider. He did not stay a minute for his errand, But wheel'd and fled, as one pursued for life. WINTHROP (opens the letter). What! [He starts up, they all rise. ANNE. What's the matter? MARY. Brother! FORRESTER. What is it? WINTHROP. Nothing; sit down! ANNE. For mercy's sake! WINTHROP. Sit down! I sayânone stir, thatâsitâsitâsit ye down! I will be back anon. [Exit Winthrop. ANNE. Oh, I am lost! Scene 4. Judge Winthrop's garden. Enter Winthrop, hurriedly, with letters in his hand. WINTHROP. Soâhere is airâsoâsoâone may breathe here; And daylightâI can see to read; and room If I should swell with rage to bursting, or Go mad, or rave like an unchain'd dog; but none To bite; yet I will bite. Hell and its devils! here, And here, and hereâtwo, three, all hersâall writ by her. Let's see, let's seeâGod give me patience! âDearest, He is from home to-nightââHe! ha! ha! ha! The dolt, the horned beast, led i' the noose, And ridden by this piece of painted fleshâ âHe is from home to-night; he will be gone For yet two days. Come, and be safe and happy.â Let me not die, good Heaven! let me not! A palsy shakes in my limbs, yet let me live An hourâbut oneâto blast her. Devil! oh, devil! âThe old man.â Old! curst be thy poisonous youth! Viper! forked viper! woman! wife! What, shame! What, pointed at as I go thro' the streets For her lewdness; the old doting fool, who kept A wanton wife to cut his honour's throat, And drive him raging mad into his grave! I'll murder her, I will; now, now, with the knife That lies on the table yonder! Better, betterâ I'll have her dragg'd before the court; I'll have her In a sheet, barefoot, walk thro' the public ways; She shall be haul'd through the mud, and hooted at, And hiss'dâmy wifeâmy wifeâha! ha! ha! ha! And I, the Judge, theâoh! [Enter Mary. MARY. Good brother!âbrother! Why have you left the room so suddenly? WINTHROP. Where's Mistress Winthrop?âwhere's my wife? MARY. Within, Much grieved at your distemperature. WINTHROP. Kind soul! Sweet loving wife! what wonder'd, ha? and sigh'd, What might the matter be? she did, did she? Ha! ha! ha! ha! MARY. Come in. WINTHROP. Ha! ha! ha! ha! MARY. In God's name, what's the matter? brotherâbrother! WINTHROP. Is she alone? who's with her? MARY. Sir John Forrester. WINTHROP. What! did you leave her all alone with himâ Alone with a man?âdid you not know she isâ MARY. What? WINTHROP. Oh, a very modest woman, so make haste And get to her again. Leave me, d'ye hear! And send her to me. [Exit Mary. I am going mad: Fire dances all about before my eyes, And my blood bubbles boiling up and down, And the air is hot as hell blasts. I will notâ I'll not go mad until I speak with her; My brain shall hold, I will not drivel yet; Not yet for one half hour, and then, great God! Blot out my sense for ever! let me become In all things as in thisâa crazy idiot, With eyes wide blind, and neither thought or memory. No memory, good Heaven! no memory! [Enter Anne. ANNE. The earth sinks in under my feet! I'm blind With terror. WINTHROP. I do hear her feet, and the rustle Of her clothes; she's coming near me; if she touches me I shall surely murder her. ANNE. Sir, I am here. WINTHROP. Oh, are you so? ANNE. Mercy! oh, mercy, mercy! You know it all. WINTHROP. What do I know?âsay what? What do I know? or rather, what know you, That like a vile thing you lie there i' the dust, Kissing my feet? Oh, for some ready weapon, To let thy hot blood from thy veins! ANNE. Oh, husband! WINTHROP. Peace, devil! wilt thou utter such a word? What is't? thy screen, thy cover-shame, thy curtain, That decently keeps thy foulness from the world. Infamous creature! ANNE. Oh, have mercy! help! WINTHROP. Close up thy lips! utter no sound! by Heaven, If thou but breathe aloud I'll murder thee! What, wilt thou raise the house, the neighbourhood? Shall your servants and your gossips come to gape Upon your shame?âperhaps they know it, though! Perhaps your grooms, and footmen too, had word Of when I lay from home. How many,âsay, How many hast thou entertain'd? ANNE. O God! WINTHROP. I'll have thee branded in the forehead, wanton! Shalt thou walk forth with that white brow, and those Blue eyes, that look like summer depths in Heaven. And none know what's behind that goodly mask? Thou shalt be labell'd, pointed at, as I am; I'll have thee set i' the public pillory, Thou shalt be spit at, grinn'd at, hooted atâ Thou shalt, thou shalt, though I die at the foot of it. ANNE. One word!âyet hear me! WINTHROP. Wilt thou touch me? ANNE. Mercy! WINTHROP. Hold off thy hands, or I will trample thee Under my feet, here as thou liest! What's this? Ha! ha! ha! ha! good wife! her wedding ring! What dost thou wear this for? for sport? for mock? Off with it!âoff, I say! and find some badge That fits thy liberal life; give it, I say! Cursed be the day when first I put it on thee! Oh, if there be a power that hears the curses Of injured men, let it give ear to mine! Mayst thou fall down from baseness unto baseness, Till in the mud and filth of lowest infamy Thou liest wallowing! May thy fatal beauty Turn to a scarr'd and loathsome hideousness, Thy lovers, who have fed upon thy wantonness, Spurn at thee with abhorrence; mayst thou die, Flung off like some foul rag, i' the common streets. Mayst thouâ [He falls down. ANNE. Oh! he is dead! I've murder'd him! help! help! END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene 1. A room in Judge Winthrop's house. Enter two Servants. FIRST SERVANT. Hist! hist!âfor the love of life, come hither! SECOND SERVANT. Well, how now? FIRST SERVANT. What's toward in the library yonder? SECOND SERVANT. I know not! how dost thou mean? FIRST SERVANT. His worship's sitting there all dressed in black: dost thou know, he must have had an ugly fall that the leech bled him for! He's as pale as death, and may I ne'er be believed but his head is white! SECOND SERVANT. What, white, sayst thou? It cannot be; but yesterday 'twas grey, an iron grizzled. FIRST SERVANT. I know it, a good manly head,â'tis now an old man's poll; and in one night the snow has fallen thick and covered it. His face looks lean, and withered, and strange, and as I hurried through, he made an angry motion with his hand, and Sir John Forrester bade me get from thence, and that we none of us should enter there till sent for. SECOND SERVANT. Where be the ladies?âmy lady and Mistress Mary? FIRST SERVANT. There too: they stood leaning against each other, for all the world like a pair of twin churchyard images, cut out in stone. My lady said never a word, but Mistress Mary wept like a fountain. What can it mean? What can it all mean? SECOND SERVANT. My life to a silver penny, the parcel that thou broughtest t'other day is at the bottom on't. Hark! âhush!âI thought I heard his worship's voice! Let us not be caught together here; let's get to the pantry, and talk at ease; some one is coming,âlet's not be found, for something's sure amiss! [Exeunt Servants. Scene 2. Judge Winthrop's library. He is discovered sitting, Sir John Forrester standing by him: Mary and Anne in the front of the stage. WINTHROP. Will you draw nearer, madam? I must speak to you, And I am weak and cannot well speak loud. Be pleased to listen to me. You have borne my name Near on six years; youâyouâDuring that time, Honour, affection, trust, and such indulgence As my means offer'd, I have freely given you. Let me be brief; how you have answer'd this, And how repaid it, you well know. 'Tis past! Wipe it from your conscience how you will, 'tis over! You'll tell me you were young, and I was old, Grey-headed, careful,âyet you married me! You did it out of thankfulness; there 'tis. You didâand I believed 'twas love. Wellâ Wellâwellâit is for this, that I forbear To cast you off, and give you to the scorn Of the world to scourge you for your sin; for I Sinn'd deeply first in folly, and therefore, I'll bear without complaint the stab you've given me; But here are two who do love me indeed, And before them I must be justified. Had you been true, Anneâhad I held your heartâ The love of the wide world might have gone begging. But you have filch'd my treasure from me, and now I gather up and count such poor remains As I can call my own. Before the world I care not how I stand; but before these I must be clear'd. I cannot spare their love, Nor by them be accused of cruelty. Speak, is this just? Do I deal rightly by you? ANNE. Oh! oh! WINTHROP. Pray do not weep! pray do not! Come, this must end. Sister and friend, this womanâ MARY. Oh, do not utter it!â WINTHROP. She's false, she's false; And I, a wretch, cover'd with shame and misery, Must drag my rest of years out as I may, In bitter and disgracÃ¨d loneliness. FORRESTER. Oh, let this quickly end, 'twill kill us all! WINTHROP. True, true; I have no right to make you suffer. I will not publish you, I will not shame you; The world shall never know the thing you are. Live yet at home, here, in my house, and call, As heretofore, all things in it your own. Only, this little let me beg: this room, My wonted dwelling room, let me reserve; And the yew-tree walk that stretches here before it, For my daily use and exercise I'll keep. Take all the rest; but here, where I shall live, I do command you never to set foot. Let me never, never, hear your voice again, Nor ever, while I live, behold your face! [He rises. O friend! sometimes i' the time when I was happy, I mourn'd to think my life was growing short; But now, thank God I am not young! Come, come; Give me your arm, and lead me out i' the air. Yet, stay a little: those intemperate words, That wicked curse, I uttered in my agony, I do retract it, and I pray you pardon it! I sinn'd to think it; God forgive you, Anne! And grant you to repent. Farewell! [Exeunt Judge Winthrop and Forrester. MARY. O sister! ANNE. What! will you touch me? will you look upon me? Do you not fear to catch this pestilence, With which I am alive from head to foot? MARY. Oh hush! hush! hush! lie still in my arms, my tears Shall wash you of your fault; oh, would to Heaven Your sorrow were all mine!âpoorâpoorâ ANNE. How paleâ How white he looked! Dost thou not think that God Looks as he look'd, when He sends souls to hell? MARY. Oh, what wild words are these! ANNE. Yes; then, you know, The blue sky rises up further and further, And vanishes away; and one goes falling Down, down, down, into bottomless despair. MARY. What dreadful thoughts! ANNE. Hark! now I'm call'dâall round, Eyes, staring eyes, all roundâto see my shameâ A world of them! Look there! there sits my father Yonder, that stern old man; and now, my husband Stands up, and points me out for sentence. No! No! no! I will not hear it, mercy! mercy! Hark! my hair rouses, and my heart stands still. Did you hear thatâand how the devils shouted? Great God! let me not be deliver'd up to him, Oh, not to himâfor ever and for ever! To every fiend in hell, but not to him! Look down, look down, in the red fireâhe's there! He grins and beckons me! he welcomes me! Ha! ha! ha! sweetheart! so we meet in hell; That's merry! well met, well met, sweetheart! look, He holds his arms out, he has clutch'd meâha! Help! help! the fire leaps up like serpents' tongues In eager flames all round meâI am burning! Undo his hands! he hauls me into them, He pulls, he drags meâhorror! save me! save me! MARY. Listen to me, Anne; give me your handsâ'tis Iâ Mary, your friend, your sister; look, dear! look! ANNE. Oh, bless thee! thou'rt an angel, bless thee! bless thee! Thou'rt come to take me out of torment; take me! Quick! quick! MARY. Come, come. ANNE. Yes, I will go with thee. Take hold of me, take care of me, good angel; Spread thy white wings over my burning eyes; Soâall is darkâ MARY. She's growing wondrous heavy; Help! help! within there! ho! [Enter Servants. Take up your mistress, And carry her to her chamber; gently, gently. [Exeunt. Scene 3. Room in a tavern in London; James Forrester discovered writing. JAMES. How bitter are the dregs! the draught was swallow'd So greedily, I scarce know if 'twas sweet; But the sour and biting flavour of the lees Lies on my palate. O thou moral dunce! Whom teaching could not make retain thy task, But who again hast fallen on a path Measured so often with thy stumbling footsteps. How deep I scorn myself! from the high bar Of mine own conscience slink I shamefully, Judged of my thoughts. Why there is nothing, nothing That is not worthier, steadfaster, more firm, More true and constant to its purposes than I am. A reed, a vane, feathers that show the wind, All things unstable are poor types of me; For they, obeying their great natural law, Do but their kind in changing; while myself, Owning one law, acknowledging one right, Straight turn, and sin against mine own allowance, And show myself herein most pitiful, That not my reason or resolve can hold me From the chance breath of every stray temptation. Oh, I could strike my forehead on these boards! Less dull! less senseless! less incapable! And now to write to her:âwhat shall I say? âI love you.â Answers she not, âYou have proved it?â If I do beg her pardon, like an alms, Given to one whose evil life hath beggar'd him, Out of her Christian pity she shall give it, And bid God help me to a better course. If I do crave her hand, shall she not say: âYea, for the hope I have of restless days, Nights, when you shall forsake my bed for the dice, The sweet society of all your tavern friends, And the fair chance of dying yet a beggarâ For all these pleasant prospects, I will marry you.â 'Sdeath! I'll not write; I've not the face! or thus, I yet will write, and bidding her consider How desperately unworthy I am grown Ever to see her, or to think of her, Beseech her to forgive me, though for ever She banish me from her sweet heart and mind, A rude, ungovern'd outlaw from all grace. [Shouts of laughter without. Now come my fellow fools! and he, the devil That leads the dance. Time was I loved this laughing; It sounds like howling now. Here comes the rout, And even quiet thoughts must give them place. [Enter Lord Alford, Wilton, Mowbray, Illworth, and others. ALFORD. Ha! ha! ha! ha! and so they were too hard for thee In Florence, Illworth? ILLWORTH. Curse their Italian craft! Their dice be devils. ALFORD. So are ours sometimes. Ha, James! what sayst thou? are they not, good James? JAMES. In your lordship's hands they are familiar devils, That spoil men at your will; but have a care! They will be paid at last their fees by you. ALFORD. How now! how now! homilies at the hazard table? Gramercy, holy preacher! is your text From theory, or experience? JAMES. From experience; As your lordship's purse might let you know. WILTON. That's well! If I were James, I'd flay him! MOWBRAY. Why don't you? He owes you just as much; peace now, be still; Here'll be a quarrel. ALFORD. Ha! ha! ha! poor Forrester! He's stripp'd to the quick; you'd think he'd pledged his skin, And lost it. JAMES (aside). Shall I take him by the throat? (Aloud). Very well, sir,â'tis the winner's part to laugh. ALFORD. 'Tis very clear you're not the winner, James; You look about to cry. JAMES (aside). 'Sdeath! I will write to her, And then end all at once. ALFORD. Come, Illworth, show us The craft you spoke of:âhow is it they play? ILLWORTH. Why, they stand round the table, as it wereâ Here, spread the tableânow, where be the dice? MOWBRAY. How many play at it? ILLWORTH. Why, all who will. WILTON. Forrester, come and see this foreign trickery. JAMES. Thanks! I have seen our English, which is good. ALFORD. Oh, let him be! he's like a hen i' the pip, Best in the corner where he's thrust himself: Go on. Well then, they all stand round the table, And here we are. ILLWORTH. Now each in turn shall say What the cast shall be, and put the stake down on it. WILTON. Well, here's my stakeâmark though, for thy example Only. OMNES. Ha! ha! here, here's for thy example. MOWBRAY. Forrester, come and wager for example. JAMES. I have done so already, for your example; Let my loss be your gain. ILLWORTH. 'Tis a curious game, sir, Well worth your eye. FORRESTER. 'Tis very likely, sir, Yet pray excuse me. ILLWORTH. Even as you will. ALFORD. Come, James, ne'er mope; what though Sir John be come, Hasn't he slack'd the leading-strings yet? JAMES. Sir! ALFORD. Why God a mercy, friend! don't eat me! JAMES. My lord, Let me but put two words more to this paper, And I will speak with you; by your good leave, Let me be private for a moment. ALFORD. Certainly: He's writing to his mistress; she's forbid him To touch the diceâhe's play'd, the naughty boy, And now is begging to be spared his whipping. JAMES (aside). Very well, I hear you,âvery well; within there. MOWBRAY. Come, Illworth, hereâhere lie our stakes all round. [Enter a Servant. JAMES. Send hither my man. [Exit Servant. ILLWORTH. Now, I will hold the dice, And as you each call out the cast, that one, Who names the number even as it falls, Sweeps all away. WILTON. How if none hit the right? ILLWORTH. The stake is his that throws. MOWBRAY. But how, if two, Or more, should say alike? ILLWORTH. If they hit right, The profit lies between them. ALFORD. A pretty game! Come now, begin. [Enter a Servant. JAMES. Eustace, if presently, My brother should come here, and I beâgoneâ Or elseâno matter, if I am not here, Here is a letter for him, and hark in thine ear. [Whispers to him. EUSTACE. I shall, sir. JAMES. Bring them now at once. [Exit Eustace. MOWBRAY. Hallo! I said 'twas quatre ace, and so it is. Fair play! fair play! good foreign conjuror! ILLWORTH. You did not say soâor I heard you not. WILTON. He did, he did, I heard him; you, my Lord, Did you not hear? ALFORD. I never hear. MOWBRAY. No matter; Hear or not hear who will, I swear I said it; I said it, and, by Jove! I'll stand to it. WILTON. I heard you say itâ SEVERAL. So did I, and I. ILLWORTH. Hoite toite! cats in a high wind! [Re-enter Eustace, bringing a case of pistols. EUSTACE. Here, sir. JAMES. Are they loaded, primed, and ready? Very good. You've got that letter for my brother? Here Is one for Mistress Mary Winthrop. You Will ride at break of day to the Judge's house, And give it herâyourself; be sure, yourself. EUSTACE. Is your honour going on a journey? JAMES. Yesâ On a long journey, Eustace. EUSTACE. Please you, sir, Nothing's prepared, or in fit order yet. JAMES. That's true, indeed! I know it very well! Good Eustace, get thee gone; think of my letters. What a hell's turmoil! get thee gone. [Exit Eustace. ILLWORTH. Let be, Let him swear out his gizzard; what is't to me! JAMES (rising). Now, I am for you. OMNES. Forrester! Forrester! Judge thou this matter! JAMES. No; pray pardon me; I have a game to play on mine own account. When that is over, I will hear this question. ALFORD. Why, well said! Now, my melancholy man! Hang it; although thy good St. John of a brotherâ JAMES. Let be my brother, if you please, my lord. Your lordship challenged me to throw the dice Just now; and so I would, but that indeed You have fish'd clean to the bottom of my pouch, And I have nothing left for you to sport with. WILTON. What ails that man? D'ye mark how pale he looks? MOWBRAY. That's what you call white heatâhotter than red. ALFORD. What, nothing? JAMES. Nothing; not the wherewithal, Unless I sit at my brother's board, to get My supper for to-night or morrow's dinner. 'Tis a plain case; nothing is right soon counted. Now, having nothing for a mess of broth To stay my stomach on when next I hunger, What shall I venture against you, my good lord? ALFORD. Will not thy credit serve thee with the Jews? JAMES. That's bye and bye; I would be playing now. ALFORD. What! nor thy generous brother lend thee a stiver! JAMES. Perhaps he might; but he is not at hand, Although I look for him from hour to hour. I would be playing now. ALFORD. I'll tell thee, James; Thy manory of Wentworthâ'tis a thought, An excellent thought!âha! ha! an excellent thought. JAMES. No doubt: what is't? ALFORD. Thou hast it yet?âthat farm? With all its goodly meadow land, and timber, The lusty growth that hath been rising there, For thy necessity, these hundred years? JAMES. Yes, sir, I have it yet; (aside)âit should have been my home When I was married, that old farm: (aloud)âwell, sir? ALFORD. Is't mortgaged? JAMES. No. ALFORD. What, sound? no corner touched? JAMES. That's wonderful, my lordâis't not to you? ALFORD. Why, thou canst raise a fortune on it, man. JAMES. Hereafter; but I would be playing now. OMNES. I'll lend thee, Forrester!âor I!âor I! JAMES. Oh, thank ye! thank ye! honest gentlemen! (Aside). Good fellow gulls, have ye so much left to lend? ALFORD. Hark, James, I'm bent to have that farm of thine. JAMES. Damn him! my blood boils o'er in spite of myself! With all my heart; shall I make a deed of gift, Or play for it with your lordship? ALFORD. Deed of gift! No, no; thou'rt jesting. Come, we'll throw for it. JAMES. With all my heart; how shall the venture stand? ALFORD. Thus: he that throws the two best casts of three, Shall call it his, and if thou winn'st, it quits thee Of all thou owest me. Is it agreed? JAMES. Agreed; Upon a bargain, worthiest sir, that when That game is o'er, you play another one On my conditions. ALFORD. I will wager thee, When thou hast lost thy farm, thou hast not left The heart, to throw another die. JAMES. Then, sir, I'll borrow yours. Your lordship's heart, d'ye hear Which seems to be of the hardest that are made, Your upright, noble, generous, kind heart. Look, worthy Sir, who plays with desperate men Must play a desperate game; do you see these? These playthings here? here lie they at my hand. Now, win or lose this manor, an ye list; He that shall throw the two best casts of three, When that is done, shall have first aim and fire. An excellent thought, my lord! ha! ha! an excellent thought. Is it agreed? ALFORD. Agreed. MOWBRAY. What is't you do? WILTON. James! for the love of heaven, play not this stake! ILLWORTH. Be counsell'd yet, sirâ WILTON. James! James Forrester! MOWBRAY. He ne'er was known to lose. ALFORD. Nor will not now; Come, James, you're angry; give this mad game o'er, I do not care to throw with theeâ JAMES. My lord, I'm ready. MOWBRAY. Some one run to his brother's lodging. JAMES. No one that loves me stir. Good gentlemen, If any here are friends to an unthrift, That never yet was friend unto himself, Stand by, and see fair play; 'tis all I ask. Now then, sir, throw; trois, quatre! ALFORD. And trois, ace! You've the better, sir. JAMES. Again, doubletts! ALFORD. Trois, six! Now for the third; trois, quatre! JAMES. Quatre, ace! The manor's yours! now, Sir, we'll try how long You shall enjoy it. WILTON. This is murder! [Enter Sir John Forrester. Oh! Thank God you've come! here is your brother James Playing with that thief of a lord for his life. FORRESTER. Stand by; Hush! stand awhile, and speak not! WILTON. Sir, the stake Is who shall have first aim, and fire at the other! FORRESTER. Peace, for awhile! let's see. ALFORD. Give up the rest. JAMES. Play my lord, play! deux, ace! ALFORD. Why, take it then, Fool, an thou wilt! trois, deux! MOWBRAY. This is most horrible! JAMES. Our merry game will presently be over, You've the best of me; trois, quatre! ALFORD. Trois, deux! so, Thou'st yet one chance of living to grow wiser, Improve it, James, if thou should'st win the match. JAMES. Trois, quatre! ALFORD. Quatre, cinq! FORRESTER (striking him). Villain and thief! That die is loaded! OMNES. Loaded! a loaded die! Seize on it!âprove it! ALFORD. Your greeting's short, and short Is my replyâtake that! [Fires a pistol at him. FORRESTER. Oh! I am dead! OMNES. Secure him! Call the watch! JAMES (seizing the other pistol). Devil! FORRESTER (wrests it from him). No! you shall do no murder, To wound me worse than this leaden death within me. What! shall he die by the hand of a gentleman Who hath lived like a felon? ALFORD. How shalt thou prevent it? FORRESTER. James! I do charge thee with this latest breath, Whose ebbing checks my speech, pursue that man To the very utmost limit of the law, And spare him not; but let his noble name Receive at the high tribunal of his peers The dignities himself hath graced it with, Of dicerâmurdererâand thief! WILTON. The watch! The city watch! MOWBRAY. Call them! ALFORD. Ha! let me pass! MOWBRAY. They are knocking now. ALFORD. Let me pass, I say! [Enter the Watch. WILTON. They're here! Take your precedence, noble sir, to the gallows! MOWBRAY. Good master officer! here's been a murder Done in broad day, before us all, ev'n now; Here lies a gentleman, wounded to death By this lord; we all can witness to the deed. WILTON. Further, here lie the dice his lordship usesâ Curious ones. OFFICER. Will you follow? ALFORD. Fellow, keep off! WILTON. To be sure; don't touch him, he's a lord! I hope They'll hang his lordship with a silken rope. ALFORD. Cowardly cur! that durst not show thy teeth Till the bear was noosed! OFFICER. Come, sir, will you walk? ALFORD. Go on. Farewell, sweet sirs! I've lived upon ye all For some time past; 'tis fit I thank you for't: So, thank ye, excellent fools, that I have fed on. God send ye wits, to cram your bellies with, And mend the holes I've made in your estates. JAMES. Hence! take him hence! [Exeunt Alford and Watch. Wilt thou be carried home? Canst thou move? FORRESTER. No!âI fear time scarce will serve. James, do not mourn, nor let thy spirit grieve That I am dead. I often, in my life, Did marvel to what use or end I lived; I know it now, and die rejoiced to think of it. Henceforth my blood, and not these painted spots, Will speck the dice that thou shalt look upon; And thou shalt fear to rattle them again, As if they were my bones. The blood has soaked All through my doublet: raise me upâO God! Farewell, poor brother! Weep not! weep not! weep not! [He dies. JAMES. Oh, sirs, he's dead! MOWBRAY. James, we will carry him Home in our arms: have comfort, sir!âsoâsoâ Flesh never wrapp'd a nobler soul than his. Bear we his body honourably hence, Whose memory shall live in our hearts for ever. [Exeunt, bearing the body. Scene 4. A room in Winthrop's house. Anne sitting by the window, Mary watching her. ANNE. The shadow has crept on. MARY. Why do you watch it so? You have scarcely turn'd your eyes for the last half-hour; What do you see? ANNE. Oh, is it half-an-hour? The light is almost swallow'd up by the shade. MARY. What light? what shade? Say, love, what are you watching? ANNE. The evening sun upon the gravel walk, And the shadow of that yew tree. MARY. What do you start at? ANNE. Come here and look. MARY. What is't? ah! now I see. ANNE. Did you see that shadow? MARY. Yes, my brother's shadow. Is this why every day, as the sun goes down, You sit at this window, straining your poor eyes; Is it to see his shadow as he walks? ANNE. Methinks, each evening, it stoops more and more, Inclining to the grave I have dug for him. Oh! if the light could only shine there still, And he still walk, and I still see his shadow! But the sun is almost set. Mary, does he walk After sunset ever? MARY. Oh, yes, till after midnight He oft continues pacing up and down. ANNE. Oh! if I could but hear his feet on the ground After the darkness takes away his shadow! I am too bold to dare to wish so much; Do you not think so? MARY. No, dear; let me smooth This pillow underneath your cheek; how fares it? ANNE. Dyingâdying; thou shalt soon, O thou sweet saint! Minister to my misery no more. For thy compassion and humility In tending one so vile, God will requite thee. My lips have lost the power to speak blessings. The shadow eats the light up, inch by inch; Ah, cruel, cruel! MARY. Lay your head down,âso; You can still watch the sunset. You grow paler; Art worse? ANNE. No, but the warmth about my heart Seems dying out with that departing light. 'Tis gone; never again! never again! MARY. This is the time when you are wont to sleep: Come, shut those eyes up, that they drop no tears. Come, I will sing to you. ANNE. Thy song shall be My dirge: let it be solemn, slow, and sad; On earth I shall never hear sweet music more. MARY. Do you lie easily? ANNE. Yes: I shall slide Even from this very chair into my grave. Is it dug deep? will it hide my sin and shame? Sing, seraph, sing, while I sink down into it. Sleep holds me; I do think I shall not wake. MARY (sings). Sleep, do not dreamâdream not, but only rest, Poor weary heart! forget thou art alive. God's mercy holds thee as a mother's breast. Cease, thou sad soul, to suffer and to strive. Dream not, but sleepâsleep through the dismal night: Beloved, when thou wak'st it shall be light. [MARY.] Fast! fast! how pale! how thin! oh, misery! How changed! she surely is about to die. And shall my brother look on her no more? That sweet young wife that he did dote on so! Shall he see her body carried out from the door, But never her? Oh, I will fetch him hither! He'll surely, surely come to see her onceâ But once before she dies. Oh, what a life Has mine become! who thus, from day to day, Stand here between them both, watching them waste And waste with sorrow; all mine own poor hopes Wreck'd on the treacherous coast of a light love; And the summer morning of my happiness Covered with weeping clouds and darkness. ANNE. Husband! MARY. It is the first time she has spoke that word. Call'st thou upon him, poor heart, in thy sleep, Whom waking thou dost almost quake to think on? Yeaâhe shall come once more to answer thee, Once more to hear thee speak; softâsoftâno noise. [Exit Mary. [Music plays while Anne sleeps. ANNE. Sweet music! heavenly strains! my soul is borne Upon your gentle stream awayâaway. There is forgiveness for the broken spirit. Thou Merciful! forgiveâforgiveâforgiveâ [Enter Mary and Winthrop. MARY. Lean on me, doâdoâwhile you tremble so. Gently; don't wake her; she is yet asleep; Do not go near to her. Oh, pray! WINTHROP. Sinâsinâ Could there be any death else? MARY. O brother! Now you are here, I fear what I have done. Begone again before she wakes. WINTHROP. So young! But one short draught of life, and so much bitter; And now the cup is rudely snatch'd from thee, And dust thrust in thy mouth! MARY. Come, come away, If she does wake, the sudden sight of you Will kill her. WINTHROP. In a little while this body, The temple once of beauty, oh, how rare! Now desecrated, ruin'd, and forsaken, Shall be hid in the earth; they'll lay her i' the ground, And I shall walk upon it still, and feel The sun. MARY. O brother! if she wakes, have pity! Be kind to her! WINTHROP. Be kind to her! O God! MARY. Hush! hush! WINTHROP. I have done thisâI've murder'd her! I, that must covet this fair flower, and snatch it Out from the sunny garden where it grew, To wither in an old man's wintry bosom! That could not see, but push'd her tottering steps Even to the dizzy verge of steep temptation. But, oh! but, oh! she seem'd to me so excellent, I did not recollect that she was mortal. MARY. Peace, she awakes! Stand from her sight awhile. How is it, sweet? has thy sleep cheer'd thee? ANNE. Yes. My spirit stands a tip-toe to begone; Accursed fear has fled away for ever; I am at peace. To have seen my husband onceâ Once to have heard him utter âI forgive theeââ WINTHROP. I do forgive thee, wife! I do forgive thee! So Heaven have mercy on me, as I do Forgive thee with all my soul! [Anne falls from her chair. MARY. You have been too sudden; Her spirit hath hurried all affrighted hence. [Winthrop raises her. ANNE. Oh, bless thee, bless thee, noble heart! WINTHROP. And thou, Forgive thou me for having married thee Unto conditions so unlike thine own. Forgive my having thrust thee to the brink And desperate precipice of thy temptation. Forgive my sternness, and unyielding temper, And all the rugged harshness of my nature. ANNE. Death, the divorcer, marries us anew. When I am cold, and carried to that bed That knows no fellowship, upon my hand Put thou once more my wedding-ringâi' the churchâ Put it upon my finger once again. WINTHROP. I will. MARY. Footsteps draw near; one knocks. JAMES (without). 'Tis I! MARY. O Heaven! ANNE. That is James Forrester; let him come in. MARY. No! no! ANNE. Let him come in. WINTHROP (opens the door). Come in; you're welcome To this solemn house, where death, with icy hands, Is slackening all our dearest knots of life. JAMES. To such a house come I a fitting guest. Behold my sable garb, and hear the sum Of my great loss in few poor words: my brother Is dead. MARY. Alas! WINTHROP. Sorrow comes thick on sorrow! We shall be stripp'd. JAMES. Of the manner of the death, Which leaves me lonely in the world, I'll tell ye Anon; a devilâthat devil Alfordâslew him; And yet I am his murderer. MARY. Hold! hold! These news have stunn'd her; why, how pale, how still! Brother, raise your arm, her head has fallen on it; She sleeps. WINTHROP. Yes, the cold sleep; she will not wake Till the dead wake, for she is dead. JAMES. O Heaven! WINTHROP. Two of the jewels of my life are gone; The one, most precious, flaw'd, and stolen from me; The other, seized, and rudely cast away. Both by one handâmay God requite its dealings. What now remains, but that I take my last, And giving that awayâlike to a beggar Whose scrip is empty, and whose alms are spent, Stretch out my limbs, and die. MARY. Oh, brother! brother! Are these the words with which you give me forth To my new fortunes? Miserable maiden! What joy shall ever smile upon my fate, Whose earliest hours of love, and of betrothment, Are spent amidst sights of death and sounds of mourning? WINTHROP. No, my sweet Maryâno, my darling child! I am to blame, to blame, but bear with me; And in the embers of my heart I'll rake, And find some warmth there yet, to bless thee with. Thy marriage peal shall be no funeral knell, Nor shall a pall o'erhang thy bridal bed; Let pass these days of mourning, and again, Before I die, I'll smile to bid thee joy. JAMES. Cheer thee, dear love! comfort, my gentle Mary! WINTHROP. Come and live with me, here, until I die; You are my heiress, all is here your own. The waters of my life have run to bitterness, And the failing fountain trickles cold and slow. Let its last ebbing drops fall in the sunshine Of your sweet love and holy happiness.
