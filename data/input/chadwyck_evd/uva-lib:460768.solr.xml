      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Grotto of Calypso in the Island of Ogygia—Leucothoe and other Nymphs discovered in melancholy attitudes—a lamp and magic book. Recitative—Eucharis. Calypso is inconsolable for the departure of Ulysses, Her grief she cannot master for the man she so much misses; Where her lover went to sea, every day she goes to stare, And instead of following her hounds, she has taken to tearing her hair; E'en night to her brings no repose, for in this grotto mystical She brews “thick coming fancies” very black and Manfredistical; Her Nymphs dare not approach her in her solitary rambles, And here is Chrismas come and we forbid our Christmas gambols. Chorus —“Light as Fairy Foot”—“Oberon.” What a fate on us to fall, We must have no fun at all, All too loud she says we play,—too loud! All too loud she says we sing,—too loud! Cast your skipping ropes away, Burn your hoops and cut your swing. Vainly we to sleep would go, All night long she sobs and sighs, Rest she can't herself, and so She won't let us close our eyes. O for some pill, to cure her spleen, Cold pudding can't settle love so keen. Euch. She comes, and fain would be alone. Leuco. Pray let her. The sooner we all brush, I'm sure the better. (Exeunt Omnes) Enter Calypso; Scena—“Di Piacer.” Cal. Deep my share of mortal woe, For Ulysses still I pine, He has left his Calypso, And in vain call lips o' mine!— In every waving bough, His farewell bow I see, Green leaves are hateful now, Since he has ta'en French leave of me! I can't abide the cry of “stole away,” Since o'er the sea his bark did roll away. To see the hounds throw off can't cheer me, By him thrown off who once was near me; My deer has proved a fox to be, And made a silly goose of me! (seats herself beside the lamp, and consults her magic book—lights down) The lamp wants trimming sadly—so does he Who is the cause of all my misery! Why should I burn a light? my fate still dark Must be, for I have lost my latest spark. My slumbers, if I slumber, are not sleep, I get the fidgets, tumble, toss, and weep. I've thought until I think I'm sick of thinking; I'm half inclined to take at once to drinking. I will raise spirits, that may raise my own; (rises) Come in some forms by which ye may be known, Ye Ardent Spirits, from the wine vaults near! I charge ye by the glass, appear! up here! Music—The back of the grotto opens and discovers the Lake of Geneva, in front of it the Spirit of Gin. Spirit. Old Tom is the best of Geneva, They owned it long ago; Ask Hodges, the spin- ner of cordial gin, Or Thompson, Fearon and Co. There are palaces built in every street To the sprite of the juniper tree. I'm here, if you wish to take me, neat, Or why did you call for me? Cal. I called thee, for I called thee, saucy sprite, Thou'rt called “blue ruin,” and thou'rt called aright. Begone, and to the poor thy poison deal, I will to see a spirit more genteel. Music—“Drops of Brandy,” at which the Spirit of Gin evaporates, and the Spirit of Brandy floats in upon a cask, the scene changing to the Straits of Dover. Spirit. In the dumps art thou, daughter? Where thy pain? what thy grief? Can brandy and water Afford thee relief? Warm with, if 'tis handy, If not, without, cold: To the spirit of brandy Your wishes unfold. Cal. Avaunt! for thy French name is “Eau de Vie,” And life is now detestable to me! To drink thee even mixed might be manslaughter, My lost Ulysses may be in the water. Hence, nor provoke me to use means severer, I'm very queer, and would see something queerer. Music—“Grog time of day, boys.” The Spirit of Brandy goes out, and the Spirit of Rum appears off the coast of a West India Island; a fleet in the distance. Spirit. I am the rummest spirit mind That ever you did see, The sugar cane I left behind Where folks drink sangaree; To ease thy pain, I o'er the main From old Jamaica jog, The fleet I met sailed better yet At the mere sight of grog. Cal. A fleet! oh, horrid sound! the thought of ships, O, Is quite enough to make sea-sick Calypso. Why cam'st thou hither, with that ugly phiz? What canst thou say to cheer me? Spirit. “Rums is riz.” Cal. Down, evil spirit to thy native hell, And say I sent thee thither. Spirit. (sinking) “Rums is fell.” Cal. These spirits cannot teach me to forget, I must have something far more potent yet. (waves her sceptre—Music—A gauze to imitate smoke covers the stage) What rises yonder, 'mid those fumes mysterious? I fear 'tis something very deleterious. Voice. (without) I am the spirit o' a private still, Wi' smuggled Highland whiskey what's your will? Cal. Forgetfulness. Voice. Of what, of whom, and why? Cal. Of my own wretched self—my sorrow's dry, And I would drown it! I feel very choky And don't much fancy anything so smoky. Voice. The still small voice of small still whiskey hear. Cal. Why can't you, like the rest, to sight appear? Voice. Troth, to do that would argue me no wise man, I've ne'er paid duty yet to the excise-man. Cal. But you to me shall pay it. Let somebody I love be now inspired by whiskey toddy. Voice. Behold! (music—Gauze rises and discovers the figure of Ulysses leaning on a pedestal) Cal. O criminy! I'm hoaxed, for this is A madness and a mockery. Ulysses! O speak to me, though but one word in Greek, If you're a gentleman, I beg you'll speak. Duet—“By the margin of Zurich's fair waters.” Cal. On the margin of Neptune's salt waters, Calypso! Has wandered the long summer's day; On the spot where thy glances last caught hers, Calypso! Has cast all her good looks away. I have called very often on thee, And in turn thou hast now called on me, Then speak to me, dearest, I pray. Ulys. Calypso! Cal. Go on! is that all you can say? Ulys. Calypso! Calypso! Cal. Alack, well a day! Calypso! Calypso! is all he can say. (the figure of Ulysses vanishes) [Calypso] My heart is broken all to little bits, Cracked is my brain, and shattered are my wits. I will no more of spirits—even wine (Except when dining out) will I decline. Henceforth I'll lady-patronise sobriety, And start a female temperance society. Air—Calypso—“Farewell to the Mountain”—“Mountain Sylph.” Farewell Shrub and Mountain, Brown Sherry and pale, Henceforth at the fountain, I'll drink Adam's ale. Claret, Port, and Madeira, Champagne and Moselle, You're too heady for me, then Farewell, oh farewell! Farewell, oh completely, Wine, Spirits, and Beer, Naught stronger than butter milk, Will I drink here; Drams and Cordials go comfort Some old Convent belle, Such drops I'm for dropping, Farewell, oh farewell. Farewell Shrub and Mountain, &amp;c. (Exit Calypso)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —A view in the Island. Enter Mercury, meeting Eucharis and Leucothoe. Euch. Law, Mr. Mercury, how do you do? Mer. Ladies, I kiss your hands and your lips too. (salutes them) Leuco. It's quite an age since we have met together. Euch. Pray tell us, shan't we have a change of weather? Men say when Mercury comes down so low, It's a sure sign that it will rain or snow, And when they see you rapidly ascending They count upon the weather shortly mending. Mer. They are quite right, although in these gay bowers I never even fall so low as “showers;” My errand here, in fact, is to inform ye, That out at sea I have been down to “stormy.” But though it should rain cats and dogs elsewhere, The glass you look in always points to “fair.” Euch. Oh, Mr. Hermes, you have such a knack Of saying civil things— Mer. As I come back I'll call and say some more; but where's the Queen? Is she up yet, and willing to be seen? Leuco. Up? I believe you. As we passed her grot She bolted out, and passed us like a shot; You'll find her at the “look out” on the cliff, From whence she last beheld the Grecian skiff That bore Ulysses from this charmed Isle. Mer. Is it far off, pray? Euch. About half a mile. Mer. I bear despatches from the king o' the sky, Say, will you take them to her or shall I? Leuco. We take 'em! If a word we dared to speak She'd knock us into the middle of next week. Air—Leucothoe—“Lieber Augustine.” With safety, so near her, We can't shew our faces; We've good cause to fear her, When she's in her frowns. An absolute Queen—she'd abolish our places, Or else with her sceptre demolish our crowns. Air—Eucharis—“L'Amour.” Anacreon Moore, with his numbers so charming, Would fail to appease her when once she's enraged; You'd better return, sir,—your duty's alarming,— And say you have called here, and found her engaged. Air—Mercury—“Merrily, oh.” Mercury's spirit sometimes rises, Mercury O! Mercury O! Until it all the world surprises, Mercury O! Mercury O! In heat I mount up without fear, O, In cold I plunge right down to zero; Mercury's wings defy capsizes, So here I go! So here I go! (first in solos and then together, the airs harmonising) (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —Another view in the Island—the sea in the distance, on the left hand a projecting cliff, on the summit of which Calypso is discovered gazing on the beach beneath her. Cal. The spirits I've forsworn still fuddle me, The meditations I indulge in muddle me. I stand upon the edge of this lone steep, And sometimes feel a strange desire to leap— And then again I don't. Enter Mercury from below. Mer. She's there by jingo. Cal. Sure I saw something yonder on the wing go, The birds fly low—There'll be some falling weather. Mer. If you don't mind, ma'am, you'll all fall together. (Mercury mounts the rock) Cal. Ulysses, oh Ulysses! why, oh why Am I immortal when I wish to die? How very hard! Of troubles I've a peck, Yet cannot either break my heart or neck. I'll try though, that I will. Earth, take these bones, And crack 'em— Mer. (holding her) Hollo! gently o'er the stones. Cal. Who art thou, in whose arm there so much nerve is? Mer. Just now I'm one of the preventive service. Cal. Ha, Mercury, I recollect your face, My grief was blind—I didn't see your grace. Mer. My scrapegrace rather; but descend, I pray, And don't break bones upon the road to-day. I have some hope to lighten your distress, I bear glad tidings. Cal. Oh, what are they? Mer. Guess. Cal. I can't. Mer. Then listen. (whispers) Cal. You're some hoax designing. Mer. No. Cal. On your life and honour? Mer. Bright and shining. Cal. I can't believe it, who has done this? Mer. You know Full well the lady. Cal. For a pound it's Juno. Mer. Done, pay the money, for (but mind between us This must be kept a secret) it was Venus; I took the note to Neptune by her order, Begging this little boon he would accord her. Cal. And he consented! nay, 'tis too good news. Mer. Look then but yonder, where the tempest brews For many a hapless tar his watery bier: (storm) That storm will wreck Telemachus. Cal. What, here? Mer. So much great Jove hath sent me here to say With his best compliments. Cal. Thrice happy day! Ulysses' son? Telemachus, oh joy! Yes, the ship sinks, but there still floats the boy; There's some one with him; who's his friend I wonder? Some queer old quiz, who looks as black as thunder. Mer. (aside) I know, but mustn't tell. 'Tis sage Minerva, Provided with a patent life preserver, For under the disguise and name of Mentor, She of cork jackets was the first inventor; But that's 'twixt Jove and me. (to Calypso) Ma'am, to depart I crave permission. Cal. Oh, with all my heart. Mer. Well, if that isn't civil, I'll be shot! (Exit Mercury) Cal. What, ho! my nymphs. From fountain, grove, or grot, Haste hither to your Queen, all those who hear her; She holds a drawing-room, and wants you near her. Enter Eucharis and Leucothoe, and at the same moment all the Nymphs appear in different parts of the stage—Telemachus and Mentor ascend as from the beach Sestetto—“Il Gruppo.” Calypso, Eucharis, Leucothoe, Telemachus, Mentor, and 1st Nymph. All. Ah! Ment. (to Telemachus) Mind, boy! mind what you're about here; What a group! O, sharp look out here. Tel. We're in luck, I make no doubt here; What a group are looking out here. Cal. (aside) We've Telemachus no doubt here On the group, how he looks out here. Euch., Leuco., and 1st Nymph. In their wet clothes walking out here, They'll catch croup or they'll catch gout here. Cal. (aloud, in feigned anger) Had we no such thing as scout here, To prevent their getting out here! Though we had a ball or rout here, They would come unasked no doubt here! Ment. (to Telemachus) Thunder, rain, and water spout here, Made us happy to get out here. We shall put them to the rout here. Still they'll welcome us no doubt here. Euch., Leuco., and 1st Nymph. Sure there's been a waterspout here, They've come up it to get out here; Passports, if they are without here, They'll be hanged without a doubt here. Cal. (aside) Although half-drowned, he looks the youth of fashion; But I must feign a most tremendous passion. (aloud) Whence and what are ye who the hungry fish on My coast have baulked of lunch without permission? Tel. Amongst the elements the late confusion Must plead our pardon for this bold intrusion. We're come, 'tis true, without an introduction But drawn— Cal. By sympathy? Ment. No, ma'am,—by suction. Cal. (aside) Some rude philosopher. (aloud) Tell you the tale. (to Telemachus) Tel. At five a.m. it blew a heavy gale— Ment. In short, we're shipwrecked—now you know it all. Cal. And you must know that neither short nor tall Are ever suffered with impunity To land amidst this fair community, In proof whereof you should be doomed to death, But that you seem already out of breath. To-day, at all events, you shall not die— Being wet we'll only hang you—out to dry. Ment. You're very kind. But he'll think it a bore, And I have been across the line before. Cal. Your name, sir, (to Telemachus) and condition? Ment. Madam, this is Telemachus, the son of sage Ulysses; Ny name is Mentor—I'm his private tutor. Cal. Mentor! Tormentor rather! Sir, be mute, or I'll find a way to make you. Pray, young man, Tell your own story—I've no doubt you can. Medley—Telemachus. My name it is Telemachus! I've seen a little sarvice, Where angry billows roll and loud tempests blow; I've sailed in Tyrian ships, And I've driven Cretan Jarvies, And— Over the mountains and over the moor, Hungry and barefoot I've wandered forlorn; My father I've lost, and my mother—I'm sure— There's fifty young men have told her their fine tales, And called her their fairest she, But— When they asked, “Are you within?” Heigho! says Rowley! She answered them yes! but I'm sitting to spin And— Oft in the stilly night, When slumber's chain had bound them, All she had done by light She undid to confound them; Singing— Where and oh! where Is my Grecian laddie gone? He's gone to fight the Trojans, And crack King Priam's crown; And it's oh! in my heart, But I wish he'd make haste home— Then I, a brisk and lively lad, Thought I'd go to see, ma'am; What could keep my roving dad From his Penelope, ma'am— So I played at Bo-peep, All over the deep, But I couldn't tell where to find him; Let him alone, Thinks I, he'll come home, With a very long tale of— How the Grecians went running to Troy, And the Trojans came running to meet 'em— But just as here with fav'ring gale Our gallant ship up channel steered, And scudding under easy sail This sky-blue western isle appeared; To heave the lead the seamen sprung, When out the pilot loudly sung— O dear! what can the matter be, Dear! dear! what can the matter be; O dear! what can the matter be, The weather no longer is fair— Loud roars the dreadful thunder. The rain a deluge showers, The skies are rent asunder By lightning's vivid powers; Quite puzzled what to do, The poor unhappy crew, Lay like logs, Sick as dogs, Without beef or biskey, oh! But lucky event, When to pieces we went, We happened to be very nigh land; So to swim we both tried, And were left by the tide High and dry on your Majesty's island! Oh, it's a nice little island, A dear little duck of an island; I am sick of the seas, And would live if you please, All my life in this tight little island! Cal. Well, I must own I pity your distresses, You seem to have been in some dreadful messes. Though you were wet, your story's made you dry, You look fatigued, too—rest till by-and-bye. In yonder grotto you'll find all prepared; The rooms are airy, and the beds are aired. Tel. A thousand thanks. Cal. (to Mentor) And you may follow suit. You'll entertainment find for man and (with a look of scorn at him) brute. Ment. You're too polite. (aside) At all her wiles I laugh, Old birds are never to be caught with chaff. (to Telemachus) I shall keep you awake with constant tapping. She's mighty cunning, but shan't catch me napping. Tel. (aside) To leave such company's a sin; methinks I shall come back when I've had forty winks. (Exeunt Mentor and Telemachus) Cal. Go, ladies, and prepare a cold collation, Then each may follow her own inclination. (Exeunt Nymphs) (advancing) He's handsomer than his papa, I vow, If I could only make him love me now! Venus might aid me, but then she's his foe; I'll write a note to her and ask her though. (takes out tablets and writes) Air—Calypso—“Lovely Lady Mine”—“Le Pré aux Clercs.” Queen of lovely beauty, Venus, most divine, I present my duty To yourself and shrine. Grant the prayer I pen you, Make this youth my own, If you won't, why then you Must let it alone. Venus, to my coast, pray Come before you dine; Or by return of post, pray Let me have a line. “To Venus, Queen of Paphos.” (directing it) Take it, wind. (letter flies off) Venus appears with Cupid. She's come already! 'Pon my life that's kind. Madam, for this politeness I'm your debtor. Ven. Oh not at all. How are you, any better? As luck would have it, we were close by, shopping, And I had thought of in upon you popping. What is't you want? and yet I need not ask. You want that lad to love you. That's a task You'll find more easy to be said than done, But you may try and warm him with my son. I'll leave him with you for the day with pleasure, But I must go—I'm hurried beyond measure. Cal. One moment! Pry'thee, who's that surly bear? Telemachus's tutor? Ven. Nay, dear—there I'm puzzled too. I only know that he Has been particularly rude to me, And brought his pupil to scorn me too. I'll ne'er forgive him—shoot me if I do! Neptune has tried to drown him twice—but rat The rogue, he's got more lives than any cat. A pedant! 'Gainst my court to back his college, His useful 'gainst my entertaining knowledge! The Book of Beauty, published by its queen, He'd stifle with a Penny magazine! If you can worry him in any way, You'll quite oblige me. Cupid, love, you'll stay With Queen Calypso all the afternoon. Diana's waiting for me in the moon. I've got to night to be an evening star, And twenty calls to make first, so ta ta! (music—Venus re-ascends) Cal. Good-bye, good Venus! If this deer I tame, Next time I hunt, I'll send you lots of game. Well, my young friend, can you assist me, pray? Cupid. I'll try. There are but few can spurn my sway, But this boy's case presents a novel feature; He is a most extraordinary creature— He snubs the ladies, and declares he'd rather Go poking round the world to find his father; However, I have got a little plan, Which I suspect will tease my gentleman; When next your nymphs— Cal. They come—I see their noses! Cupid. Go you away—I'll hide amongst the roses. (Exit Calypso—Cupid hides in a rose bush) Enter Eucharis, Leucothoe, and Nymphs. Chorus. Girls so gay, come out to play, We'll do no more work to-day; Come with a hoop, or come with a ball, Come with a good will, or not at all. Euch. What shall we play at—forfeits? Leuco. Forfeits! stuff! I'm for a good long game at blindman's buff. Euch. Well, blindman's buff then—who shall first be blind? Enter Telemachus and Mentor. Leuco. One of these gentlemen will be so kind. Ment. From all such follies we must stand exempt. “Familiarity doth breed contempt;” Pray let it understood between us be, You shan't blind him, ma'am, and you can't blind me. Leuco. Civil, I vow. (to Telemachus) And do you say “fain play?” Tel. (to Mentor) Please, sir, mayn't I have a half holiday? Ment. Not to enlist yourself 'neath folly's banners. “Evil communication spoils good manners.” Tel. Ladies, you hear, I am a luckless suitor, I am kept in by order of my tutor. Leuco. Well, round my forehead let the scarf be tied. Cupid reappears from rose bush, with bandage over his eyes. Euch. Stay! here's a blind boy ready cut and dried; Come hither, little master; what's your name? Have you a mind to join our Christmas game? Cupid. Ladies, a second time you shall not sue, I'll play with all my heart, (aside) and all yours too. Leuco. This is your station,—now, my little man, Turn round three times, and then catch whom you can. Dance—After a while Cupid catches Leucothoe—music ceases. Leuco. Hey-day! This boy is sure the worst of pickles; Plague take the little rascal—how he tickles! (breaks from him—dance resumed—he catches another Nymph—music ceases) 2nd Nymph. Let go—you tease me, and I'll play no more; I vow I ne'er was caught this way before. (retires) Euch. (aside) There's something monstrous queer about that elf, I've half a mind that I'll be caught myself. (dance resumed—Eucharis puts herself in Cupid's way—he catches her—she breaks from him—music ceases) What's this I feel—grief, pleasure, pain, or joy! Whatever have you done, you naughty boy? Ladies, beware! that urchin near you creeping, If you but look on him you'll pay for peeping; At all events, beware you touch him not, His hand is like a furnace—it's so hot! 3rd Nymph. Surely a child like that can never harm us! My hand's quite cold. 4th Nymph. And mine— 3rd Nymph. Let's make him warm us. (dance again—Cupid turns each of the Nymphs) What's this?—I burn! 1st Nymph. I roast! 4th Nymph. I broil! 5th Nymph. I fry! 1st Nymph. You little rogue! 4th Nymph. Oh, my! 3rd Nymph. Oh, fie! 5th Nymph. Oh, cry! (Exeunt Nymphs) Cupid. (to Telemachus) These ladies, sir, seem tired of my face; Suppose you let me blind you in my place! Ment. Telemachus, Telemachus! mind me; “There's none so blind as those who will not see.” Do you not mark, who near that urchin lingers, As sure as eggs is eggs will burn his fingers. Tel. My sage adviser, Lindley Murray begs Another time you'll say that eggs are eggs. Ment. When, to save you, you see me in a hurry, I'll thank you not to bother me with Murray. Tel. Why mayn't I with that child my time employ? He's surely an engaging little boy. Ment. Engaging!—yes, no doubt of that, you stupid; Engaging is his trade—his name is Cupid. Tel. Cupid!—and is that Cupid?—pray don't row me; But I must speak to him—will you allow me? (to Cupid) Cupid. You do me honour, sir: I recommend A partner—Lady Eucharis—my friend. Tel. (aside) I feel an overishness come all over; Sure I'm transformed at once into a lover. Ment. That serves you right—you put me in a rage; It's little use to stuff your heart with sage Reasons, if thus you let that rascal spoil it. Why if it were his father's heart, he'd broil it. Quartette—“Mi manca la voce.” Eucharis, Telemachus, Calypso, and Mentor. Euch. Oh, who can this boy be? He's hurt me severely. Why should I feel queerly And he go scot free? Tel. A plague take this boy! he Has hurt me severely. Why should I feel queerly And he go scot free? Cal. (entering) Oh, where can this boy be? He's not heard me clearly; He's made them all queerly; None will go scot free. Ment. Oh, hanged shall this boy be! He's hurt mine severely; I'll make him pay dearly; He shan't go scot free. Cal. I'm all astonishment! (to Cupid) What have you done? Cupid. Hush! not a word! I've caught 'em all—such fun! Cal. Such fun indeed! Are you too blind to see What's fun to you, sir, may be death to me? Cupid. I've done some mischief, one way or another, And that's enough—so I'll go back to mother. (Exit) Cal. (to Mentor) A word in private with your youthful friend. Ment. (to Telemachus, aside) If you should want me, do not sigh but send. (Exit) Cal. You'll join the chase, Telemachus, I trust? Tel. I should be happy, madam, but I must, I fear, be jogging on to seek my father. Cal. No farther seek, but stay with me the rather, Reign with me here where rain doth never fall, Where Winter's music's never heard at all; And where you may with safety upon this count, That india-rubber cloaks are at a discount; Where bright Apollo, in his march sublime, Though god of verse, won't suffer frosts of rime. My coast is clear, my skies are never hazy, My smiling meadows never lack a daisy. Stay then, and love but me as I love you; No knife shall ever cut our love in two. Tel. Unless my love is cut in two, alas! I do not see how this can come to pass. Cal. Not come to pass! have I made this confession, And is another lady in possession? Tel. (aside) I had almost betrayed myself. (aloud) Oh no. Cal. Then why the dickens did you scare me so? For whom would you divide your love in two? For whom? with whom? Tel. Papa. Cal. Papa! pooh, pooh! I'll be your father, mother, sister, wife. Tel. Your Majesty's too gracious, on my life. Cal. But not a word just now, my nymphs are nigh, We'll talk this matter over by-and-bye. Ladies, the hounds throw off at Breakneck Thicket. We hunt to-day. Tel. A hunt?—Yoicks! All. That's the ticket. (Exeunt Eucharis, Leucothoe, and Nymphs.) Enter Nymphs, in hunting dresses. Air and Chorus—“Let us take the road”—“Beggar's Opera.” Calypso and Nymphs. Let us take the field! The hour of the chase approaches, On a manor where no one poaches, To the glorious pastime yield! See the lance I hold— We laugh at the doctors' glasses, Our system theirs surpasses, We don't buy our health with gold. (Exeunt Omnes)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —A Forest. Enter Mentor. Ment. So so! the game is up! Mistress and maid Are bent upon the same though, I'm afraid; And yet, so much the better, for I've found Between two stools we often come to ground. I'll lead Calypso where she may discover Miss Eucharis coquetting with her lover; And if some precious trick she doesn't serve her, Why then my real name is not Minerva. It is impossible, young Mr. T. Could live in Hymen's bonds with that Miss E.; And what's impossible can never be, And never, never, never come to pass— Who thinks it can, is but a stupid ass. Son of Ulysses, up this proverb treasure, “Marry in haste and you'll repent at leisure.” Air—“When time hath bereft thee”—“Gustavus III.” 'Tis time thou hast left here, O pupil of mine; Or of freedom bereft here, To late thou'lt repine. When the rose pink shall vanish That now paints thy dear, And the want of the Spanish Makes creditors queer— Thou'lt complain of the badness Of times; and to me Confess it was madness To marry Miss E. They come! Calypso must not longer doubt of it. Enter Eucharis and Telemachus. Euch. We're in the wood. Ment. (aside) Don't hollo till you're out of it. (Exit) Euch. Oh, that together we through life could trip so; But weren't you just now kneeling to Calypso? Tel. Kneeling to her, sweet maid! Come, that's a good one; One couldn't after seeing you—now could one? With you alone I'd live—without you die! Euch. You just say that 'cause no one else is by. Tel. Sweet love, you wrong me! let me swear again!— Euch. They tell me that's the way with all the men. Tel. I'm not like other men—indeed it's true! Euch. That's strange, for other men are just like you. Tel. I vow—protest—I never will deceive you! Euch. (curtseying) And I am fool enough, sir, to believe you. Tel. You are? then is my happiness complete, I'll settle here and buy a country seat. Enter Calypso and Mentor. Cal. You settle here! I'll settle you and her too! That in this isle such things should e'er occur too! Euch. Pray don't be angry with this gentleman— I can explain. Cal. I make no doubt you can. Tel. Madam, be merciful!—she's very fair; It had been so with you had you been there. Cal. Fair? she's as false as thou! Oh, fie upon her! And then she calls herself a maid of honour! Euch. Away then with obedience to the wind, I'll love my love wherever him I find; Madam, without the slightest hesitation, I beg to tender you my resignation. Duet—Eucharis and Calypso—“Beggar's Opera.” Euch. Farewell, Queen Ca-lyp-so, Your paltry wages scorning; I'll pack my portmanteau, And wish you a good morning. Ca-lyp-so. Cal. You're quite right, saucy maid, In thus my wages scorning; You've no right to be paid, As you yourself gave warning. Saucy maid. (Exit Eucharis) Ment. (stopping Telemachus) No, you don't follow her, so needn't try— Go in! I'll talk to you, sir, by-and-bye; First to the Queen I have a word to say— And while the sun shines I must make my hay. (Exit Telemachus) Cal. Knives, scissors, bodkins! he still sweet as sugar is Upon that saucy slut—that minx, Miss Eucharis; But if he won't wed me, he shan't wed her, And that I swear by Styx! Come hither, sir! It's clear you want Telemachus away— I've not the slightest wish that he should stay. To-morrow's paper treats of building ships, I've got an early copy—in the slips— And you shall have it. Ment. Thank you for the favour— But I know everything. Cal. A walking Mavor! Then build a ship like that in which you came. Ment. But where to find materials for the same? Cal. You said that you knew everything, you fool. Ment. That's the exception, ma'am, that proves the rule. Cal. Down by a cave, which forms a sort of limehouse, There stands a poplar creep there like a sly mouse; Cut the tree down, then up, and there remain At work—but mind, let no one see you plane; Behind the entrance to the cave on stools You'll find a vast variety of tools; And dipping in a box which never fails, E'en at your fingers' ends you'll find some nails; Work like a workman who has much to do, And all you see in one you saw in two; You'll soon get through it if you're not a dolt, And when your wood-work's ready make a bolt. If I have left no pitch upon the shelf, Just put to sea—the ship will pitch itself. Ment. Verbum sat sapienti. In a trice I'll do it, madam—you shan't tell me twice. Duet—Mentor and Calypso—“Se la vita”—“Semiramide.” Ment. To sea! Cal. To sea! Ment. To sea! Cal. Get out of this island, You shan't live in my land, Nor longer on dry land, So now, sir, you know; You've both made a blunder, My vengeance you're under, In lightning and thunder Away you shall go. Ment. I laugh at your worry, You're hotter than curry, The cause of your flurry, Young woman, I know; There shan't be a slip, ma'am, Between cup and lip, ma'am, I'll just build that ship, ma'am, And then off we go. (aside) I've beat her, Cal. (aside) I have beat him; Ment. (aside) I shall cheat her, Cal. (aside) I shall cheat him. (Exeunt Mentor and Calypso)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —The Beach of the Island at low water, and by moonlight, seen through a perforated rock. Music—“Pretty Star of the Night”—Venus, as the Evening Star, rises in the horizon. Ven. As I suspected, Mentor love defies, How very lucky 'twas my time to rise. Where is my hopeful son? Cupid, my dear, I want you, come directly. Enter Cupid. Cupid. Ma, I'm here. Ven. You are! and don't you know what mischief's brewing? Cupid. I think I ought, for it was all my doing. Ven. What, to let that vile Mentor build a ship, And with Telemachus give us the slip? My stars and garters! Cupid. Oh, mamma, for shame! Ven. Well, I can't help it, then; be made the game Of all the sky by these two clods of clay, I won't endure it. Find me out some way To turn the tide—some night's move that may check 'em. Cupid. Do as before—ask Neptune just to wreck 'em. Ven. He can't. He told me but this afternoon, He cannot raise the wind again so soon. The last time he was forced to give a rout, He put his trident up the water-spout. Cupid. Well, 'pon my honour, that was forking out. What can be done, dear mother, for you know Calypso's sworn by Styx that they shall go. Ven. O, burn the Styx. Cupid. Stay, you have struck a light Into my brain-pan, and a prospect bright Is kindling. “Burn the Styx,”—theirs shall be burned Before they cut them, don't you be concerned. Dry your bright eyes, for ere they have done winking, Through this night's watch they'll see yon vessel sinking. Ven. A mother's blessing be upon thy brow! Cupid. I'm much obliged; but don't stand preaching now— Here comes the lady I must work on. Fly Up to your own blue lamp-post in the sky. (Venus rises—Cupid retires) Enter Calypso. Cal. Too hasty Queen, what has thy passion done— The ship is built, and they may cut and run. Cupid. (advancing) Not if you'll trust to me! Cal. How so, my dear? I've sworn by Styx and cannot interfere. Cupid. But Eucharis— Cal. Name not that hated name! Cupid. Hated or not you're partners in this game— If Mentor wins, the stake is lost to both. Now though your Majesty has ta'en an oath, It don't bind Eucharis, and I'll inspire Her and the rest to set the ship on fire; In that ship's smoke old Mentor's hopes you'll smother— You haven't sworn that he shall build another. Cal. “A Daniel come to judgment” you indeed are— But Love was ever known a special pleader. You darling Love! as swift as meditation Or your own thoughts effect this consumation Devoutly to be wished—the furies raise up Hate, Jealousy, Revenge, and make them blaze up; Remember, though, it must be your affair, I but look on and laugh at their despair. Vainly old Mentor hopes to cross the ocean, My learned friend takes nothing by his motion. Air—Calypso—“Der Freischutz.” Though they think o'er me to crow, Soon the ruddy flame shall glow, They will find it is no go. Mentor and Telemachus Still shall lodge and board with us. Burn then, burn, I do implore thee, Cupid, Cupid, I adore thee. (Exeunt Cupid and Calypso) Enter Mentor. Ment. So that job's jobbed. Enter Telemachus. Now, Master T., away! Tel. Whither? Ment. No, not with her, with me; “delay Is dangerous.” To mizzle I decide. I've built a ship—she'll float with the next tide. And see, 'tis rising fast. Tel. A clap of thunder This to my hopes. Where's Eucharis, I wonder? Mayn't I take leave of her? Let me go back, Indeed I must. I've got my things to pack. Ment. Pack nothing—but pack off without delay. Tel. But Eucharis! Ah! see, she comes this way, With all the Nymphs, who lighted torches bear. Ment. Aye, led by Love, Hatred, Revenge, Despair, And Jealousy, that green eyed monster, who Eats nothing which his own cook doesn't stew. Stand by and let them go on with their burning. It's a long lane that never has a turning. Enter Eucharis, Leucothoe, and other Nymphs, with lighted torches, led by Cupid, Jealousy, Revenge, Hatred, Despair, and the Furies. Chorus —“Siege of Corinth.” Come flare up and burn his ship, A bonfire soon she'll make; He thinks he'll give us the slip, But it's quite a mistake. As eyes fail to raise a flame, Or them to bewitch, It may be a burning shame, But we'll try pitch. Then flare up, as Cupid's chain They would break in two, We will patch it up again With links bright and new. (Exeunt all but Mentor and Telemachus) Ment. Love, still I laugh at thee! oh, shallow dreamer, The vessel I have chartered is a steamer— She's got her coals aboard, and he can't spoil her, The fire he lights will only heat the boiler, And ere “Jack Robinson” the rogue can say She'll get her steam up and be under weigh. Here she comes smoking like a modern dandy. Away! this is no moment words to bandy; Up, up with me, I say! From yonder rocks We'll jump at once upon the paddle box. (forces Telemachus up the rocks—the steamer glides on as they ascend) Tel. Ah, Eucharis! one last—one little peep; How oft you've said, sir, “Look before you leap.” Ment. True! but at present that won't suit my book— In this case you must “leap before you look.” (pushes him off the rock on to the paddle box and jumps after him—the vessel sails off) Re-enter Cupid, Eucharis, Leucothoe, Nymphs, Furies, &amp;c., Calypso. Cal. Baffled! defied! It's all along of you; Vile Love! since he is gone, be you gone too! Cupid. I'm sure to stay here I've no inclination, But you detain me by some fascination. Cal. I'm sick of all the flummery you utter! Ment. (from the vessel, which has re-appeared at sea) You're right, “Fine words no parsnips ever butter. Cal. Who art thou that can thus e'en Love disarm? Ment. Wisdom! whose Ægis shelters youth from harm; Behold me in my proper form appear. (assumes the form of Minerva—the name of “Mentor” on the paddle-box changing at the same time to that of “Minerva”) All. Minerva! Cupid. Oh, the murder's out then! Min. (to Telemachus) “Hear Me for the last time, oh son of Ulysses!” Cal. What! “for the last time”—such a night as this is? I beg your pardon;—wise as you may be, That's anything but a wise speech for me. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg to say, I hope you won't be led by her away; If you approve, I'll bet the prude a penny That this will not be “the last time” by many Telemachus shall listen to her voice, Or I to yours—oh! let my heart rejoice In those sweet sounds that now alone can cheer The muffled drum of sad Calypso's ear; Let no cross Mentor with some proverb stale Our harmless nonsense weigh in reason's scale. Remember Christmas comes but once a year, And you have made success proverbial here; Then “vogue la Galère” shall be my motto, Or, as the boys say—“Don't forget the grotto:” But on the strand when fortune drives your ships, O! Take shelter in the island of Calypso. Finale—“Merry may the Keel row.” Cal. As you come down Newcastle Street, Oh let me hear you sing— “Tis yonder lives Calypso, Suppose we just look in.” Though love is looking rather blue, If you are not disappointed too, I do not care a pin, And merry may the keel row The steamer my lad's in. Chorus —And merry may, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
