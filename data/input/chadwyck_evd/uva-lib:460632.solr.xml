      <field name="fulltext">THE SICILIAN VESPERS: An Historical Tragedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. Many romances and dramas have been founded on that great historical event, entitled âThe Sicilian Vespers,â all of which must, to a certain extent, have an interest in common. The present production is based on Les VÃªspres Siciliennes of Monsieur Casimir Delavigne; but in my development and details I have used a free and independent hand. I have both modified and added to the incident, in the view of giving truth and force to the action; and for the merits or defects of the language of my tragedy throughout I must of necessity be alone responsible. That it should often bear such vague similarity to that of the French drama as belongs to circumstantial allusion, and a common tendency to the same result, was inevitable; but for such passages as produced the most powerful effect in the representation of this drama, not even the occasion occurs in the work of the French poet. I must repeat my grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Davidge, whose zeal in my favour, under very trying circumstances, has been unremitting. To Mr. Elton, also, who so fully justified his engagement as the star of my dramatis personÃ¦; and to the ladies and gentlemen of the Surrey establishment, who so ably supported him, I beg to return my best thanks, for the talent as well as zeal they have manifested in the representation of the Sicilian Vespers. I am also bound to acknowledge the liberal support I have met with on this occasion from the public press, with which I have every reason to be gratified. J. K. 30th Sept. 1840.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE.âAn Avenue of the Palace of Procida. A Mariner enters, driven on by St. Clair; Procida enters behind, observing them. ST. CLAIR. Begone, audacious miscreant!âdare you mutter? MARINER. I speak but for mine own. I have been robbed, And lawfully may say so. ST. CLAIR. Art thou silent? Avoid my path, or I shall teach thee law Thou'lt dearly pay for. Thou hast no property. Thou art a stubborn traitor; and thy life Is ours, to take or spare. [Exit. MARINER (drawing a dagger, and about to follow him.) Beware thine own. PROCIDA (stopping him.) Madman! dost know no better means of vengeance? MARINER. Canst thou instruct me better? PROCIDA. Ay; put up Thy good stiletto,âit shall serve anon. Thou art a mariner, and haply know'st not What's passing in the city. MARINER. Well I know I am not the only desperate man in it. PROCIDA (mysteriously.) West of the port lives Paullo Zuckarelli, Well known,âa brother sailor,âseek him out. If thou wouldst kill thy foe and live thyselfâ Live free and fearlessâhe will teach thee how. MARINER (understanding him.) I thank thee! This I would have heard. Thou hast made A friend,âa firm one. Heartily I thank thee. [Exit. Salviati enters. SALVIATI. The garb of a Cordelian monkâtis he! (Procida recognises him, and advances.) Welcome, most welcome! Joy to Sicily! Our chief among us! Speak!âassure my senses Thou'rt Procida indeed. PROCIDA. In the firm grasp That patriot binds to patriot, when a cause Like ours unites them, know and welcome me. Health to my countryman! Palermo, hail! Hail, and be free; for I have sworn thou shalt be. SALVIATI. Thousands have sworn it. On the verge of Fate, And only respited from day to day, Lives the light Frenchman, till a word of thine Give breath and surety to the whelming ruin. Now, briefly, how hath fared thy long self-exile? PROCIDA. It hath been Bitter, but fruitful. No meek pilgrimage Of idly-measured steps, and holy patience; Each tuft or stone that bore my weary head Served as an altar for my vows of vengeance. Through our devoted cities long I roved 'Mid insolence and outrage, and beheld The treasures of our husbandmen given o'er To spoil and reckless waste. My busy zeal, In ever-changing shapes to shun observance, Wrought to its purposeânow beneath the cowl, At nightfall, in some cloistered shade, I roused The deep, remorseless rage of the fanatic; Like the gaunt maniac, now, with haggard stare, I loudly raved against the foreigners In curses and wild prophecies; and now, Fashioned like some shrewd citizen, discussed Their free and fatal licence with our dames, Till in pale lips and flashing eyes I saw The sallow demon of Sicilian breasts Awake and fanged for mischief. Through the Isle All hearts were ours. Then, sailing east and west, Briefly to speak, I have secured for you The King of Arragon, the eastern CÃ¦sar, And the great Pontiff's thunders. SALVIATI. We'll build you monuments. PROCIDA. Now, what is our dependence in Palermo? SALVIATI. The best and strongest still. The stern Borella, Julian de Fondi, and Alberto d'Aquila, Mario, Lazarra, and the Loricelli, With fifty other as determined men, Pant for the day of onset. Such among us As hold familiar intercourse with Montfort, Fav'ring his lighter tastes, his sports, and revels, Have thus diverted him from dangerous note Of aught that might alarm him. Even now 'Twere best to strike,âa time of festival,â The people loose,âtheir priests to stir their fury,â Our victims all abroad and unprepared! What says our leader? PROCIDA. We'll advise on't quickly. Ranks not my son among your chiefs? Methinks You named him not? SALVIATI. Touching your son, the charge you left with us Will best revert to your paternal prudence: Nor I, nor any of your friends, have dared Propound our views to him. The brilliant Montfort Hath wholly won him: even in your palace He holds his court at Loridan's entreaty. PROCIDA. That I had heard, but deemed it a device To aid your purpose. Loridan his friend! Is he so potent to ensnare men's hearts? SALVIATI. In truth, his noble nature may defy His enemy's report. Humane and generous, Were he as vigilant to spy abuse As eager to redress it, this our cause, In the main source and sinews of its strength, Lacking the griefs that nerve it, he had withered. Rich in the polished arts of peace, he bears The first renown in arms; and though impetuous To meet offence, he hath a gracious frankness That speedily repairs the wrong he does, And pardons that he suffers. Confident As he is brave and guileless, he would meet The bravo's dagger levelled at his breast, And, smiling, tell him he mistook his victim. PROCIDA. He represents a tyrant,âstands in trust For rank oppression. I expect my son. The trusty follower I sent to you Hath also summoned him. He comes. We'll speak in private: see our friends, And say I'll follow quickly. [Exit Salviati. Loridan enters. LORIDAN. It is my father! (embrace.) Welcome! Oh, most welcome! PROCIDA. My heart repays thee. LORIDAN. Why this dark approach? After so long an absence, do I meet you, And in the very precincts of your palace, Masked like the midnight robber? PROCIDA. In my palace Dwells one I hate, and thou shouldst blush to see thereâ Thy country's foe!â The man entrusted to confirm her bondage! LORIDAN. If you would speak of Montfort, everywhere The best and bravest may respect his virtues. Brothers in arms, his hand conferred on me The scarf of knighthood, and he hath, beside, Done me such favour as I cannot choose But in my best requite. PROCIDA. No more of this; These are the shallow flatteries of Frenchmen, And fool thine inexperience. LORIDAN. No, sir. True He hath his hours of lightness, some may think More than become him; but he wears no mask, Nor speaks the thing his heart avouches not. He is too brave a soldier to be false; And though the laurels cluster o'er his brow, He pants for honour as if none were his. Beneath one standard are we pledged to join Our chivalrous career. PROCIDA. My son, be warnedâ Warned by a father's love; or, if thou wilt not, Trust him, and learn thy wisdom of repentance. Wouldst know the proud career he means for thee? He'll waste thy youth, make profit of the zeal That fires thee in his service, and at last Withhold thy recompence, control thy fortune, And clip thy laurels, lest they o'ershade his. And hast thou never, 'mid these new temptations, Said to thyself, Palermo is in chains! Ne'er heard in her forlorn and wretched streets The muttered execration; marked at dusk Her citizens in watchful clusters met To whisper of revenge? Was Loridan So school'd in rough and Roman independence, And is he now so supple? Hath a courtier, And an oppressor of thy country, too, Estranged thee from her, rooted from thy soul The sacred memory of Conradin, Our martyr'd prince?ânay, stolen thee from thyself, Thy honest self? If thou art thus degenerate, Thou'rt not my son, thou'rt not my countryman. LORIDAN. I never was disloyal, Sir, nor can be. PROCIDA. The royal orphan, too, thy loved Leanthe, Hath she, and hath the oath that binds thee to her, Lost all their power? LORIDAN. Heaven witness for me, no! There, there, my father, be my kind counsellor. Would my Leanthe were unchanged as I am. Search thou her thoughts: she weeps, yet tells not why. I saw the knights of France assail her heart In crowds unheeded. Now, I fear their chief, That conqueror of all hearts. PROCIDA. Thy Montfort! LORIDAN. Yes; He loves her; yet I dare not doubt his justice. But yesterday, in open confidence, Not knowing of my love, he told me his; Nay, came a suitor for my intercession. You have a brother's power with her, he said, And now must use it for thy friend. In dumb perplexity I bowed my headâ Throbs checked my utterance. I dared not trust My eye to look on him, my tongue to speak. When, on a sudden duty called, he left me. PROCIDA. And shall his slave dare cope with him? 'Tis gross! Let nature and thy duty counsel thee: Think how thou mayst defy him. Feed thy gall; And let the venom'd thoughts of yesterday Brood and beget bold deeds. There is a way To make all sure and do thy country justice. Didst never dream on't? LORIDAN. Speak not darkly, Sir. What you would say, why should I shrink to hear? PROCIDA. I have been absent long, have journeyed far, Amid privation, misery, and danger, And think'st thou vainly? Hast thou ne'er surmised Why I departed, wherefore thus return In mystery? I loathed my home! My soul Was dungeoned there. It would be freeâit shall; And in its native Sicily. Come near, And tell meâif a glorious work were now Ripe for the doingâthou art pale! Farewell. Go play the babbler to thy Montfort. Crouchâ Cling to thy chains, and die defending them. LORIDAN. You know me better, Sir. My life is yours. Be my thoughts free, and speak at full your meaning. PROCIDA. Who comes? LORIDAN. The princess, bending towards the chapel, To do those sacred offices she now Makes her so frequent custom. PROCIDA. Fit occasion! I'll cross her path, and thus, unknown, awake Timely remembrance of her solemn vows. LORIDAN. Do this; and whatsoever dark intent Lie struggling under that resentful brow, Your fate is mine. PROCIDA. That pledge I shall exact. Enter Leanthe and Attendant; Procida approaches them. LEANTHE. Save ye, good father. PROCIDA. Benedicite! Princess, I crave a moment's hearing. LEANTHE. Speak. PROCIDA. Know ye this signet? LEANTHE. Ha! 'tis Procida's! He bade me when I saw it to respect The bearer for his sake. What tidings of him? PROCIDA. He is in health, and you will meet ere long. On this he'd have ye silent, and meantime Enjoins you by that token to respect Thy brother's dying words, by which he claims A daughter's love of thee, his son a husband's. Soon as your reason and your heart's matured, Joining your hands upon his tomb, your vows Confirmed his wishes. You remember it? LEANTHE. His goodness to me and my vows to Heaven I never can forget. Who, then, suspects me? [Glancing at Loridan. LORIDAN. Alas! I love not lightly, my Leanthe, Nor would be doubtfully or coldly loved. PROCIDA. Forgive him. I would have his thoughts now free, For I would use them to a noble purpose. The spirit of Conradin is now abroad, Inspiring every bold Sicilian heart, And will avenge a sister's perjury. Say thou'lt be true. (Leanthe much embarrassed.) LORIDAN. She dares not. PROCIDA. Speak! LEANTHE. I will. PROCIDA. Be just, then, Loridanâdeserve thy fortune. As she respects her duty, think of thine; Be mindful of thy pledge. Let each devout remembrance I have raised Restore ye to each other; and awhile Farewell. Ere noon thou'lt hear of me. [Exit. LORIDAN. Can you forgive me? LEANTHE. Loridan, I have. LORIDAN. Yet there is still Displeasure on your brow. LEANTHE. Alas! alas! Why may I not in some lone convent's gloom, Without a hope, save that I may reserve In heaven, consigned to penitence and prayer, Wear out my days! LORIDAN. What words are these?âthey freeze me; Blighting the hope your heart denies to cherish, And shaming still my blindness. Say, what guilt Demands your penitence?âwhat grief your tears? LEANTHE. Have I not cause to weep? LORIDAN. You have, you haveâ A deep and fearful one. Long since you wept For Conradin; and I have seen those tears Yield gently to the beams of peace and gladness. Some care hath sprung anew that will not be, Save to the eye of dotage, masked or hidden. That it should be soâprotestations, oaths! In woman's heart some new caprice will come, O'ermastering all! LEANTHE. I meant not to offend youâ What have I said? LORIDAN. Have you a grief, Leanthe, That shuns the sympathy of Loridan, And shall I doubt its source? You know I cannot. Nor by the wrath that waits your broken vow Will I thus live in abject misery! Have I not marked you in the festive maze Till my heart sickened at my eyes' observance? Have I not track'd you to the altar's foot, And almost listened to the sacred words Consigned to him who had less right to hear them? Confess:âa dazzling troop now court your smiles; And one above the rest, who, when he wins them, Will bear aloft his plume with fresher grace; Or, at the fÃªte, touch his ProvenÃ§al lute To softer strains of his own minstrelsy, And steal into your heart. These blandishments Are none of mine; and who shall boast them more Than he, your new, avowed adorer, Montfort! What ails you, Madam? You are strangely moved. LEANTHE. That a wild fancy should mislead you thus! LORIDAN. That a wild fancy should mislead you thus! What, I have told you more than he had dared, And the proud thought hath shook thy poor dissembling. Yes; if to know your power be dear to you,â And dear to every woman's heart it is,â Montfort hath own'd he loves youâown'd to meâ Nay charged me with his suit. LEANTHE. You check'd it, then, And told himâ LORIDAN. No; my words were fruitless. Mark me! Your voice alone can humble his bold hopes; And must, without an hour's delay. Assert My claims, and dare all human power to shake them! This, if you prize my quiet, may assure it, And this alone. LEANTHE. You know not what you ask. How should I do this? How should I command Or courage or occasion? LORIDAN. Better thoughts Will bring you both, or both must be commanded. For the occasion, doubtless 'twill arrive. Thy feeble courage, Heaven forgive and strengthen! Nay, speak not nowâyour words or silence now I dread alike: and with my youth's fair friend, So gentle, so religiously beloved, My wrongs may deal too roughly. Only this Before we part. A friendship more devout, Of purer source, or firmlier based, ne'er sprung In human breast than I have felt for Montfort! 'Tis light as air, or woman's lighter vows, Pois'd with my love for thee! Look to my rights! No vague, ambiguous word to tamper with. If we contend as rivals but a day, Our arbiter is death! [Exit. LEANTHE. How stern an empire does he take already Over my weakness; and my guilty thoughts Turn then to all the tenderness of Montfort! That dangerous homage, frank, yet how respectful! Modest, yet free from all servility! Heaven and the sufferings of my martyr'd brother Sustain me in the anguish of my struggle; And let the secret of my heart consume me Ere it escape or sway me from my duty! One effort, and we meet no more. [Exit. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE.âA Hall in the Palace of Procida, open to a prospect of the port and country beyond. Montfort enters, attended by Gaston, St. Clair, Salviati, Fondi, D'Aquila, French Knights, and Sicilians. MONTFORT. The cares of state dismiss'd, now, my brave friends, You that the King demands for distant service Make profit of your time. A purer sky Shall never wake your spirits to delight, Nor nature with a lovelier aspect lure The gazing eye to fond captivity. Such and so fair my own ProvenÃ§al fields; And these the sweeter that they oft recal Their cherished memory. You, Sicilian friends, Control our pastimes, so disposing them That we may husband well our stay with you. To-day the chase. How say ye, Gaston? GASTON. No; My hunting's past. But if a veteran friend May add some moments to the brief allotment You have bestow'd on business, 'twould oblige him. MONTFORT. Ever some sarcasm on thy tongue, old friend! All here have been campaigners like thyself, And done their gallant deedsâthe laurell'd head Ill brooks the dull routine of cabinets. St. Clair succeeds us, he'll make amends for us. ST. CLAIR. Will you not trust me? GASTON. 'Twere ill manners, Sir, Before our present viceroy, should I say The state would profit in the change. ST. CLAIR. I thank ye. Gaston, it seems, grows weary of his calling, Forgets his soldiership, and, some report, Designs to teach philosophy. GASTON. Much need on't. Should the King pension me to teach endurance Among Palermo's citizens, 'twould prove No sinecure. MONTFORT. Come, this is but thy humour. There are Sicilians in our circle now Who know my heart, and may command it freely To do them right. Is this your business? GASTON. I'll speak in private. MONTFORT. Friends, I'll follow you. [Exeunt all, except Montfort and Gaston. GASTON. You are too little chary of your person! As one responsible for all the griefs That prey upon the city, guard it better. But yesterday, with one companion only, You walked the public streets. MONTFORT. And shall to-day. When I am guarded for my safety's sake, Let infants mock my tremors as I pass, And cowards buffet me. GASTON. I know you well; And 'tis my earnest love that would protect Your manly virtues. For the King's advantage, Who boasts no superfluity of those May do his service honour; let thy prudence Bear out thy bravery. Look abroad, nor think, Though few complaints may reach you, few are uttered. MONTFORT. Gaston, I love thy praise; and setting it Against a world of calumny, should deem My fame acquitted. But my gallant comrades Will not be reined with churlish discipline. Brave soldiers should be generous men. GASTON. They should. But we in all things rush beyond the bound Of sober feeling. Long impunity Hath nursed injustice, arrogance, and insult. The soldiers ape the licence of their chiefs, And daily brawls disturb the city's peace. Look to't: if you depart, and leave us thus, The King will lose his Sicily. MONTFORT. Then you and I must help him to regain it. What else remains? GASTON. Deal with him honestly. Demand authority to soothe a hate That will not be despised. I note what's passing. Your ear is lull'd by flatterers and minstrels,â Mine, listening to the murmur, low and deep, Learns of the gathering storm. Confront the truth. You go to spread abroad our Christian faith. Be a fair fame thy harbinger, and shew The holy standard, idle mockery else, Unstained with brute excess and ruffian pride. Win thee the prayers of the oppress'dâsole incense A king or conqueror may safely breathe. Our danger presses!âgreat ones, priests, and people Have faces busy with some stirring purpose; And oft they speak of Procida, that stubbornest Of all our foes. MONTFORT. He will return our friend: His surly spleen will yield to time and travel. GASTON. Rather find strength in both. 'Tis that he seeks. I've cause to say so. MONTFORT. You are credulous: The father will not league against the son: And if there be a man in Sicily That loves me, and may claim my confidence, That man is Loridan! GASTON. Be not you credulous. A GUARD (without.) You cannot pass. JULIA VILLANELLI. I've business with the viceroy. MONTFORT. How now?âthe Lady Julia Villanelli! Julia Villanelli enters. JULIA. Your pardon, noble sir, that I intrude Against your special orders. MONTFORT. Mine! Intrude!â A lady whom the princess calls her friend! JULIA. I gain your presence by surprise, to crave Justice for wrong, defence from tyrant outrage. MONTFORT. Speak, madam,âwhence this charge?âwho hath provoked it? JULIA. A Frenchman, highly trusted, strong in power, Boasting your friendship, and disgracing it. MONTFORT. St. Clair? JULIA. The same. GASTON. The man of gibes, who promises Reform and diligence. JULIA. He hath preferred A lawless suit to me, which honest means Nor silenced nor abashed; but only urged To most audacious and offensive freedom. My lord, apprized of insults still unceasing, As now they met, with sudden anger moved, Spake out his just reproach, and was at once With numbers and with shameless force o'erwhelmedâ Prisoned and fettered like a criminal. Will you release him, sir, and do him right? MONTFORT. Madam, he shall conduct you from the palace. You know my wishes, Gaston; see them done. GASTON. The office is most grateful to me. [Exit. MONTFORT. This St. Clair Stands proudly in the favour of the king; Yet shall he know my mind, and feel my power, Which, should it fail me, for my country's honour, This quarrel should be mine. JULIA. Let me not rob Our many sufferers of your time and care. I have announced my coming to the princess, And will attend her where I am accustomed. I charge you stir not. Shame, such libertines As this St. Clair! But for the gallant Montfort, If my report may serve him, all desert A knight and noble gentleman may claim, I'll vouch for to his fair renown. MONTFORT. Hold there! That flattering tongue may do me better service, And shame me less, with her you go to seek. Will you commend me to her? JULIA. If you'll trust A woman's penetration to interpret A woman's heart, to win you favour there Shall quit my debt to you at little cost. To all your hopes, success. [Exit. MONTFORT. Too flattering words,â Dare I believe them? Ha! Leanthe comes; Now Fortune find me favour. (Enter Leanthe.) LEANTHE. Monfort! MONTFORT. You would not shun me. LEANTHE. Sir, I sought The Lady Julia. MONTFORT. She attends you, Madam; Yet will not envy me a few blest moments. What mean those looks? Would they rebuke my wish? LEANTHE. I am a Mainfroy, Sir, and still a mourner. MONTFORT. Too long a mourner. Wake to love and joy. May I not hope? You know my heartâyou must. LEANTHE. 'Tis true, Sir, Loridanâ MONTFORT. Hath he then spoken, And hath his friendship only thus availed me? You tremble! Am I, then, a man to fear? If my devotion and my love may win you, My suit shall be eternal: other means My pride disdains. Ambition is my frailty. You are a princess; I, a knight of France. Call me your knight, and make me all you will. My king and my Leanthe may inspire Deeds that shall bring fresh honours on my head; Nay, crown it with its sovereignty in turn, Won of the misbelievers. Love that dares Aspire to thee can ne'er be blest without thee. LEANTHE (aside.) Dare I reply to him? MONTFORT. I'll hail your silenceâ LEANTHE. Hold, for I must not hear you. Shuddering terror Alone hath checked my speech and licensed yours. Light man! forgetful of yourself, of me, And of my holiest duties. When did Nature Blend her opposing elements, or make Wild union of her fixed antipathies? My murdered brotherâ MONTFORT. Would have found in me A friend and advocate. Unjust reproach! I fought in fields that sullied not my sword, Nor shared that needless horror. LEANTHE. You enjoy Its fruits,âthe power he left to usurpation. The holy church its altars would deny To love so monstrous, call it blasphemy, And greet it with a curse. MONTFORT. Unchristian error! Oh, how unworthy of those angel lips! The blasphemous are they whose venomed tongues Profane the Heaven they serve, whose ministry Makes men enthusiasts in their evil passions When nature would have hushed them. Quit their cells, And be thy pastor that blue Heaven itself. Look up, and thence inhale The beam of Love, the breath of Charity LEANTHE. My fate is sealed. My dying brother gave me To one he thought might worthily possess me. MONTFORT. Might worthily! To whom? LEANTHE. To Loridan. MONTFORT. To Loridan! The manâYou trifle, Madam. LEANTHE. 'Tis certain. From his father we received The mandate, and a solemn vow hath bound us. MONTFORT. 'Tis past belief. Your vows are mutual, then. LEANTHE. Sir, I am his. MONTFORT. And this my friend!âmy creature! A boy!âand I his fool! Dark, damned Sicilians! They circumvent us. Honest Gaston knew him!â The princess, too! He towers above us all. LEANTHE. How hath he done ye wrong? MONTFORT. No matter, Madam. Farewell. I will not urge your further stay; I would not feed my torment, nor inflame My anger! LEANTHE. He comes! MONTFORT. Ah! LEANTHE. Hold him blameless, for he is so. [Exit. Loridan enters. LORIDAN (apart.) So they have met, then, and his looks declare She hath been earnest with him. (To Montfort.) I seem unwelcome here. You are in anger. MONTFORT. And you, that tone would tell me, are prepared for't. LORIDAN. Prepared to calm it, as a friend should be. MONTFORT. Talk not of friends! A friend, Sir, hath betrayed me! A stripling, too, in whom the vernal glow Of young simplicity and ardent virtue Opened my heart as to the radiant face Of truth itself. Yet he, this honest seemer, Hath coiled and brooded like a serpent there To sting it; prey upon its secrets; use them To his own dark, insidious purposes. You are that friend, unblushing traitorâyou! LORIDAN. You rave! MONTFORT. I took upon myself to think My friendship flattered yeâhad done ye honour Great as your hopes when I conferred on you The sword that dubb'd you of our chivalry; But you had prouder thoughtsâthe blood of Mainfroy Had tempted you; and having seized betimes Advantage Fortune gave you, you had dared In treacherous security behold My growing hopes with pity! LORIDAN. All my pride Is little that can patiently endure This tyrannous injustice; and I feel I condescend when I reply to you In sober vindication of my truth. Of me you claimed no secrets; and the tie That bound me to Leanthe I concealed In sole obedience to my father's wish. She came to me a dying brother's trust, Which, let me say, my love and long devotion Hath honourably sanctioned. MONTFORT. 'Twill not pass. She came to you a young and guileless maid, The easy victim of whatever tales Dishonest influence assailed her with. These are your rights, or whence your mystery? Heavy suspicion lights upon your father: Treason and foul rebellion are abroad, Stirred, it is said, by him. What! he would drive The French invader forth, and urging, then, This trim alliance, seize the sovereignty For his aspiring boy! LORIDAN. Believe it so. The foul aspersion of dishonest dealing I spurn, and throw thee back. For my ambition, Had it aspired to rule in Sicily Against a stranger's claim, the guilt, methinks, Had not been damning nor excessive. Friendship Alone has blinded me to that misrule And despot arrogance; sole, ample source Of those rebellious signs that threaten you. I feel it now; and yet in friendship charge ye Drive not a groaning people to despair. MONTFORT. So! treason ripens, and the renegade Breaks boldly out! Dost brave me, insolent? LORIDAN. That air of sudden loftiness I brave And smile at; it imposes nothing. I am at home, and there, at least, your equal. Your friendship is for slaves, and I disown it; My prideâthough less, Heaven knows, than you would have itâ I yet may thank that it restores to me My freedom and my self-esteem. MONTFORT. 'Tis well! Then in the power you dare insult, be taught I am your master. Think not to despise The foe you make of me. Begone!âhenceforth The meanest of my train is more than you; Sink down, and writhe among the common crowd, Unworthy them; for you had found an ear For those complaints which all your patriot zeal Could find no tongue for. Get you from Palermo! 'Tis my command, and see that you obey it! Then if the Princess, disenthralled, forsake ye, Rail out and call me ravisher. No more. Follow the restless malcontent, your father! Thus do we part, and such the leave I take Of thee and of thy friendship. [Exit. Procida enters behind, as having observed Montfort, and gradually advances. LORIDAN. Is it so! Scorn'd, hunted from my palace, turned abroad With no more words than serve an outcast dog! And no redress!âno hope, but base submission! My father!âwelcome! Montfort is a tyrant! PROCIDA. The rival, then, hath marr'd the deity! Yet as he quitted you the wrath of Jove Could scarce shew mightier or more imperial. How will you meet his thunders? LORIDAN. Teach me that. I am condemn'd to ignominious exile; The holy bond that makes Leanthe mine Threaten'd with outrage, branded with reproach! You are suspected for a secret traitor. 'Twere comfort now to know 'tis not unjustly. Must we endure it? PROCIDA. No! we have endured Too much alreadyâwe, and all of Sicily. The worst they can suspect I have deserved; And the slow march of my determined vengeance Weighs heavier on my soul than all its guilt. For sixteen years hath this usurping horde Thus trampled on our rights. In every city The blood of innocence hath largely flow'd; Our manhood hath been humbled, and our beauty, With ruffian licence, spotted and defiled. Our native wisdom, dignity, and virtue, Hiding their heads, have given their honours up To deck the profligate. Our industry Hath fed their riot, and our holy temples Their avarice hath plunder'd and profaned. The poor man toils not for the daily meal Rapacity may seize. Scared Enterprise Shuts her far-reaching eye, and folds her armsâ The merchant is a beggar on the mart, Or bears to other lands his bankrupt hopes. Palermo! once so proud, so glorious city, Where are the days of thy prosperity? And have I found amid thy miseries One of thy citizens who felt them not, And Loridan the friend of the oppressor! LORIDAN. 'Tis past! I feel it hath dishonoured me: I'll forth and rouse the peopleâlead them onâ PROCIDA. Peace! thou'lt entomb their liberties for ever,â War thus declared were impotent and fatal. What would ye? LORIDAN. Force them from the land!â PROCIDA. No, no; Here let them die and rot,âthe troubled world Be rid of them and their accurst oppression!â Feast they our wolves; and let their bleaching bones Bestrew our shores,âa salutary warning. Thousands of hearts in Sicily feel thus Inspired and guided by a band of heroes. Wilt thou enrol with them? LORIDAN. Conspiracy! PROCIDA. What else shall grapple with a lawless force? The conqueror, who wantons in his power, Well knows his victim is his enemy; And to revenge, work darkly as he will, Throws down the gauntlet, and defies the worst: My life is staked on the attempt. Decide! LORIDAN. We share one destiny! Bring me among ye. PROCIDA. Come, then. Yet, as the father and the son Link thus, why steals this first compunction o'er me? My boy!âmy Loridan!âshould I attaintâ LORIDAN. Shrink not a moment!âI am firm. PROCIDA. Yet hold! First quit the city,â'twill be noted else: I will devise the means of thy return, And bear meantime to our assembled friends The news of thy enrolment. Know thy mindâ Montfort must die! LORIDAN. Montfort must die!âand yet, To leave Leanthe thus! PROCIDA. Delay not now; She's firm and faithful to us: Salviati O'erheard her with indignant sternness check The tyrant's suit. We'll charge him to instruct her With all it may concern her peace to know. LORIDAN. No more! Lead on! Home of my ancestors, Awhile farewell!âwhen I return to thee, Oppression's blood shall streak thy marble halls, And Procida acknowledge thee again! END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE.âA Court of the Palace.âThe Entrance of a Chapel. Leanthe enters in disorder, with an Attendant. LEANTHE. I cannot tarry longer in the chapel: My brain is dizzy. Bid the priest forgive me! The air, the boundless air, will best restore me. ATTENDANT. Shall I not seek assistance? LEANTHE. No! That stranger, That man of mystery, who crossed my path, Gave meâand yet, I dare not tell of it. Didst mark My wild and wandering speech? ATTENDANT. You spake of Montfort. LEANTHE. Heaven will forgive me! Dark forebodings hung A spell on all my senses; still I saw His form before me. Through a mist it broke Of drizzly blood; then gazed on me with looks That mildly spake at once reproach and pardon; And ever thus still vanished and returned. (Julia Villanelli enters in haste.) My Julia! Oh! most welcome! JULIA. How is this? What mean these looks? LEANTHE. 'Twill pass awayâ'tis nothing! JULIA. My husband's free! and the enraged St. Clair, Encountering the Viceroy, dared accost him In mutinous and bold affront, which soon His sword avenged. Struck mortally, 'tis said, The recreant fell beneath it. Can I less Than plead for favour for this generous Frenchman? LEANTHE. From whom? For favour! Hush! the priest will hear us. Heaven will avenge the sacrilegious words; Madden, and drive us from its altars. Hush! JULIA. I know your bosom's grief. LEANTHE. Did I not tell you My vows to Loridan? Fiends will tear my heart; And for their bitterest mockery call me, Woman! JULIA. Sweetest Leanthe! Can I see thee thus, Nor bid thee seek thy happiness? I cannot. Shall that resentment, due to guilt alone, Visit the virtuous, and revolt the good? Are hearts assign'd and sympathies bequeath'd Like base extrinsic things, which all alike Receive or pass away? No; such a bond Nature proclaims 'twere greater sacrilege To keep than set at nought; a bond of wrong, Which, were your Loridan as generous Montfort, He would release you from and tear asunder. LEANTHE. Delude me not! Speak rather of the tyrant Who banish'd Loridan his homeâdisgraced him! JULIA. The hasty turbulence of baffled pride! He'll reassume his clemency, and quit you, Perhaps to bear away a broken heart, And leave one to avenge it. Must he die? LEANTHE. Die! ayâ'tis so decreed. Revenge and death Are lurking round him. See, I bear his sentence! Read! Shall we not avert it? (Takes a paper from her bosom and delivers it.) JULIA (reads.) âTrue to your duties and the blood of Mainfroy, âFear not the tyrant's threats. His doom awaits him! âRest in the palace, tranquil and assured, âTo welcome there, at last, your friends in triumph!â LEANTHE. Dark plots and daggers aimed against his life! JULIA. How came this paper in your hands? LEANTHE. 'Twas given me By one close mantled, as I sought the chapel. I went to pray for Loridan, and still My ear was startled with the name of Montfort. Then the priest marvell'd, and his angry brow Drove me, disorder'd, from his awful presence. JULIA. He comes! Entreat him to remain within. LEANTHE. I tremble to behold him! Montfort enters. MONTFORT. Fair Princess! if I am again your suitor, It is for pardon only. Armed with power, I have employed it rashly, and I fear The eye of jealousy enlarged my wrongs. Forgive me, nor believe me yet so base That I would persecute the gentle heart I cannot win. So it atone to you, Let Loridan return. Entreat it of him, If uncontroll'd your faith is pledged to him; His fortune triumphs, and I bend resigned. Henceforth I am his guest no more. 'Tis fit With honest Gaston I depart at once; My state will follow. Madam, fare ye well! LEANTHE. How! Leave the palace with no more attendance? MONTFORT. These fears from you! Are they a bye-word, thenâ The fashion of the hour? LEANTHE. They should be so! Does no dark boding come upon your mindâ Hear you no whisperings of untimely fate? MONTFORT. I have indeed such warnings, and would hush themâ Prophetic whisperings of despair and death; But from no bravo's hand, or enemy'sâ Mine is a gentle executioner. LEANTHE. Alas, you will not heed!âI charge you, stayâ Your life's in instant danger! MONTFORT. Shall I fear The loss of that which now I value not? LEANTHE. Such thoughts are sinful. Do not go nowâI pray you, do not go! MONTFORT. Pray Heaven to give me strength,âI cannot tarry. LEANTHE. Ungrateful man!âMust I, then, sue in tears? MONTFORT. Tears and ingratitude! For what ungrateful? Is, then, my state so fallen, that I must now Lavish my gratitude on mere compassion! Madam, you hasten my retreat. Farewell! LEANTHE. Assassins lurk for you!âyet stayâoh, stay!â Live for thy sovereign's, for all good men's love! MONTFORT. 'Tis vain! LEANTHE. For mine, then! MONTFORT. Heavens! Did I hearâ LEANTHE. Madness! JULIA. The truth. She loves you! Heaven has heard it! Despair no longer. Live for her. Learn here Your danger. (Gives the paper.) MONTFORT. Joy!âdelirious joy Obscures my sight! 'Tis some dark warning, doubtless, Yet comes to me an oracle of bliss! Receive my vows of endless gratitude. LEANTHE. Kneel not to me, to Heaven lift up thy hands, And let thy purer prayer avert the blow From my devoted head. MONTFORT. You cannot sin. Infinite virtue! Heaven is around you. Gaston enters. GASTON. My lord, forgive me if again I check The courtier's dalliance for the statesman's duty. MONTFORT. Say on, old friend. My life is precious now, And I will guard it; list thy warning voice, And share thy dreams of danger. GASTON. You have guess'd My errand truly; and be sure, my lord, I am no dreamer. Dangers palpable Are gathering round us, and claim all your thoughts. I come to make disclosures. MONTFORT. Make them quickly. Here you will speak as to my single self. GASTON. I hinted of my fears in Procida; Last night he landed on the coast in secret. LEANTHE (aside.) What tale is this? MONTFORT. Is't certain? Whence your knowledge? GASTON. I had some cause to look for his arrival, Derived from vigilant and wide research. Disguised as a Cordelian monk, a veteran Guarding the palace recognised his person; Of which informed, I ordered his arrest. The guard conducts him hither. LEANTHE (aside). He is lost! MONTFORT. You have done loyally and wisely, Gaston; Yet here I am his debtor and his guest. How should I treat him as a criminal? GASTON. Proofs may escape him. LEANTHE (eagerly.) Give me back that paper! GASTON. A paper! Not if it concern our safety; You cannot, nor you will not. MONTFORT (aside to her.) Calm your fears, Lest they betray those whom you mean to save. Should it containâ [Peruses the paper. LEANTHE. Conduct me hence. My sight Is darkening, and my heartâthe wrath of Heaven Already punishes my perjury. [Exit, supported by Julia. MONTFORT. This to suppress would make of me a traitor. GASTON. We must be firm. No man must yield him now To sensibilities that guard from spleen The idle hour of peace. Our fame's at issue. Insanity hath seized on every Frenchman. To-day, in spite of studied provocations, The people shew a strange, unshaken patience; And hence they laugh and deem the rebels tamed. Far other signs I see which they regard not,â The teeth fast clenched, the rankling spleen held down, The circling glance of caution, and the sneer Of hollow self-control that feels revenge Assured and not far distant. Be not rash! Young Loridan has re-appeared, and comes With loud remonstrance on his sire's behalf. 'Tis bold! But why has he concealed his coming? MONTFORT. That let him answer. I am sure he's guiltless. He comesâand mark!âerect as when we parted. Loridan enters, followed by Procida, in the custody of Guards. LORIDAN. If I have dared, beneath my natal roof, Again appear before your generous mercy Recalled me to my own, think not I come To brave your power. Your wounded pride may plead Strong against me;âbut what against my father?â What guilt is his, save in the dreams of dotage, Or conscience-sick imaginations? PROCIDA. Be temperate, my son. What is my crime? MONTFORT. Strong circumstance sustains us in our charge. You are an active foe to this our empire; The kindler of a fierce, disloyal spirit That threatens us with rupture and revolt. Too proud to do us service, and too weak To shake us in domestic opposition, You have been tampering, we are well advised, For foreign aid against us. PROCIDA. I have led A wandering life of discontent and sorrow, Which, for a plotter, I have ill concealed; And shallow politicians hence infer The worst against me. MONTFORT. If we still offend you, Why this return? What seek you now? PROCIDA. A grave. Howe'er disgusted with my generation, I would be buried with my ancestors. MONTFORT. You would be lighting up the brand of mischief; Let loose the stubborn malice of your soul, Which now you think has made its purpose sure, And stake the desperate trial. PROCIDA. This becomes you. Provoke my age to some unguarded act, Some treason rash and sudden, that at length I may die free amid a land of slaves. MONTFORT. Must you be taught respect? PROCIDA. Who first may claim it? Youth plumed in power, of lawless force deriv'd, Or age, bent down with shame and grief beneath it? MONTFORT. Nor shame nor sorrow arm the dark assassin. Your guilt is known. The proof is in our hands. You seek my life. PROCIDA. MONTFORT. You! The foul design Is here disclosed; and all suspicion points Firmly and undiverted still to you. For Loridan, despite his wrongs, each thought, Each candid feeling of my heart defends him. His soul's of finer temper, and his word Acquits him, or condemns. Know ye that paper? Or aught of its contents? LORIDAN. Amazement! Yes. PROCIDA. My son! LORIDAN. How came it in your hands? What treacheryâ Oh! this is agony beyond my fears. MONTFORT. What would you say? Not that it came of you? LORIDAN. Ay, though the rack should follow. Aimless, hopeless, Betrayed, given o'er to shame, disgrace, distraction, Rend every limb, 'twill ease my tortured spirit. MONTFORT. Thou a conspirator! LORIDAN. My guilt's my ownâ Associates I disclaim. Provoked with wrongs High spirits cannot tamper with, I sought Your life, sought of myself alone. Revenge Yearn'd for its prey; yet hand to hand had offered Open encounter. If my desperate thoughts Took ampler field, it was in wildness all: Plot I had noneâand this my utmost treason. My father claims his freedom, justly due To this avowal. MONTFORT. Brief and vain perversion! The raw and ill-trained rebel thou hadst made Were more an object of our grief than terror. LORIDAN. Respect my hate, or it may foil your clemency. MONTFORT. How shall I aggravate the punishment Your crime hath met already. In Leanthe, Your father gave what nature's voice denied His right to give. This wrung the secret from her. (Shews the paper.) The heart that never could be yours is mineâ Ay, honourably mine. Reply not thus, Nor let high Loridan, in sordid envy, Disclaim a friend, whoâlet Leanthe witnessâ Resolved to do that justice he requires. Spite of yourself, for me you yet shall live: A vessel shall convey you from the coast, Till I secure your pardon from the King. PROCIDA (to Loridan.) I charge you, curb your rashness. MONTFORT. Well advised! Be you, Sir, his companion! You incur Too much suspicion to be here at large In times like these; your palace be your prison. (To Loridan.) Knight of St. Louis! battle with foul thoughts: We're Christian soldiers all, and know our dutyâ Your vengeance failed, mine may be more successful. [Exit, followed by his train and guards. PROCIDA. Will he not charm thee to forgiveness? LORIDAN. Never! Hast thou no refuge? Shall my fears for thee Stifle a wrath of fire? And must we fly, Like baffled demons, fangless and despised, To brood on our despair? PROCIDA. Despair!âfor shame! That dastard word we know not or despiseâ The tongue of manhood scorns to utter it. I've hope for thee. LORIDAN. Undaunted soul, say on! And let me owe to thee a second life. PROCIDA. Gaston is here! When he retires, we'll talk on't. Gaston enters. GASTON. The viceroy, Sir, confiding in his friend, Fearless betakes him to his 'custom'd hour Of stillness and repose. To Loridan He leaves the privilege of one at home; But has required, on special intimations, That you, Sir, till the hour of your embarking, Be burthen'd with my presence. PROCIDA. What you deem A burthen, Sir, but meets my earnest wish. I feel the viceroy's favour to my son; And on a matter much importing you, Importing, too, the welfare of the state, Had sought your private ear. GASTON. You now command it. Follow me. [Exit. PROCIDA to LORIDAN. We'll not be long asunder. [Exit. LORIDAN. What may this mean? Is this his vaunted hope? Can Procida prove renegade, to seek His safety in desertionâtreacheryâ And talk of hope that points not to revenge? No matterâI have none. Yet let me not Yield blindly to the fiend that suddenly Darts his black poison through my veins. It may be A boastful rival may abuse me. Ay; Leanthe must alone decide my fate. [Exit. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE.âA Hall of Audience. Leanthe enters. LEANTHE. He follows me. Where shall I hide me from him! Loridan enters. LORIDAN. Is it from me you fly? LEANTHE. Avoid meâleave me! Reproach me not to torture and distract me. LORIDAN. Dare I reproach you?âDare I call Leanthe Ungrateful, perjured, vilest of dissemblers, Making of all things sacred but the fence Of vile imposture. Speak! nor let me longer Stand doubtful of the ruin tottering o'er me; But loose and let it fall. LEANTHE. What wouldst thou ask? LORIDAN. What! Thou art mine!âmine to adore thy truth, Or follow with a husband's wrath thy falsehood! Thou hast betrayed me, given me o'er to shame, To triumph in my fall and wed my rival. That paper which I sent thee to relieve Thy fears, amid the shock of dreadful things, Thou gavest to Montfort!â LEANTHE. No; I gave it not. LORIDAN. Not gave it? LEANTHE. Nor could I believe it thine. LORIDAN. You stir the mortal weight upon my heart. If I have erred, 'twas in by boundless passion. All stings and taunts high natures turn against His anger tried me with. I feared to lose thee: Say still thou art mine. Oh! yet in mercy leave me A ray of hope, and patiently I'll bearâ Nay, bless my penance. LEANTHE. Thou hast nought to fear; Montfort will do thee justice. But of me, Think never, never more! LORIDAN. You trifle still! Pronounce my doom. LEANTHE. I dare not. LORIDAN. Then you have. Come, out with all,âfear not a sentenced culprit. Your pity mastered you, and you confessedâ LEANTHE. I know not what. If that relentless heart Know nought but vengeance, desperately I meet it. He was too noble to have been thy victim: I saved him!âask not how! Pour thy hot wrathâ I am dishonoured for thy plighted brideâ And let it fall. Spare not! Call down the thunder! Rail till you shake my brain and all's forgotten. LORIDAN. And thinkest thou thus to move me? Witness, Heaven; There's not a saint thy piety invokes Has been the martyr to his faith that I am: But not to suffer with a saintly patience. Hear me! Nay, start not. Live till life be loathsome! Thy country's malediction follow thee! And may the man who made thee what thou art, Like thee be fickle, and like thee be perjured, Till thy heart writhe with every jealous pang That now wrings mine!âthen mock each fond caress With icy scorn, and smile upon thy madness! Such be thy wedded joys! LEANTHE. I'll wed with no man. LORIDAN. Thou shalt not! So 'twere best. That guilt I'll save thee. Pray for thy Montfort. LEANTHE. Darest thou threaten still! His truth defies thee, as his mercy shields thee. Repent thee! Live, and let me die in peace. [Exit. LORIDAN. I know thee nowâand thou hast proved the woman! He who hath so far won thee may possess thee. Possess thee! No; my sword is left me still, And now let justice guide it. Procida enters. PROCIDA. Now, my son, speak uncontroll'd. LORIDAN. Where's Gaston? PROCIDA. Where he'll trouble us no more. I bad thee hope. My heart was resolute. With specious preface of a vast disclosure, I led him where the western colonnade In solitude o'erlooks the sea. Just then A boat sailed full before us, and conveyed Deserters from our band. Behold! he cried, The traitors will escape us! 'Twas the moment! I stopped his clamours with a lion's gripe, And plunged my dagger in his heart. The cowards Beheld me as I hurl'd him down the steep; And making signs of renovated hope Put back to join us. I expect'em. Rouse thee! LORIDAN. Ay! for a deed like thine. E'en such a tale I would have heard;âit fills my soul with envy. Now shalt thou find me worthy of my father; Stern, savage, pitiless, as thou wouldst have me; Ripe for a scene of giant desolation. Enter Salviati. SALVIATI. Amazed and breathless have I hastened hither! What sight have I beheld? Are ye then free! PROCIDA. Our sentinel hath toppled from his post; And we are free, if we dare use our freedom. Few moments now remain for qualms and tremors. List to me, both; for both are yet to learn Repentance and retreat are barred against us. The watchword has gone forth in every street, Where my arrest will ne'er be known or heeded. 'Tis fixed the vesper bell commands the onset: And sound it will though we be deaf to it. The fateful hour advances. Through the city Ten thousand listeners eagerly await The signal that unsheaths ten thousand swords, Gives breath to sixteen years of groaning wrong In shouts of vengeance; and each languid arm, With sloth and want half withered, and decayed Beneath the spell of ruthless tyranny, Nerves to the work of bloody retribution! Our stauncher friends, who scorned in panic haste, Like you, to fly, my trusty follower, By secret entrance, known to me alone, Have now assembled in the western hall. Where are your run-aways? SALVIATI. With wonder seized At such a deed as thine, when all seem'd lost, They wait without; though still some craven spirits Would sue for Montfort's mercy. PROCIDA. Haste and meet them! Say, I would have a word with them ere yet They stain their names for ever. Lead them freely On to the western hall. None there will heed us. Be prompt, and Sicily may yet be free. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. A Hall open to the city.âGleams of moonlight. Conspirators discovered on the watch. ALL. Procida! Procida! Enter Salviati, Fondi, D'Aquila, and other Nobles and Conspirators; Procida and Loridan on the opposite side. PROCIDA. Welcome, right welcome, all! Some guard the avenues. Draw round me. Say! do I meet friends or renegades? Brief time is left us. I am pledged in blood For your success. Be martyrs or avengers: The choice is still your own. Salviati, speak! SALVIATI. I cannot. We are a disordered crowd. Whate'er thy steadfast soul dare yet expect Disunion and alarm will now, I fear, Forbid to put in act. It is too late. PROCIDA. Too late! It is the moment! Seize it boldly. Gaston, St. Clair, and with them every danger Of new surprise is far removed from us. And are there falterers among ye still? I have staked all; and by a daring deed Here we are masters, till resolved once more We rush abroad, even from the spot we stand on, To consummate our work, to win our freedom. Be firm; be rulers of the land ye live in. Recall your cause, and let it shame your fears. 'Tis not to change one tyrant for another,â In humbling one, 'tis to instruct them allâ 'Tis to be free! respected of ourselves, And claim for Sicily, be king who may, Man's equitable rights, secured and chartered. This is the hope to which you would oppose The chance, the desperate chance, of abject safety. D'AQUILA. Let Villanelli speak. SALVIATI. He's not among us. FONDI. Not here! SALVIATI. Nay, never doubt him. He has been Too openly the Viceroy's advocate To harbour treachery. He and others think Montfort will be the friend of Sicily. PROCIDA. Corrupt her friends! Rivet her chains past hope! LORIDAN. Behold his mortal foe,âstained with his friendship, Wrong'd by his treachery. By me he falls! I swear it. PROCIDA. Let him thus atone to Sicily. The dazzling conqueror pants but for renown; Ardent alone to make his king new victims, He'll leave yon shallow rebels to his mercyâ His mercy, his who hath abandoned us To all the licence of his robber bands To keep them staunch, as huntsmen throw their dogs The offal of their prey. Think ye to gain His confidence? There's not a man of you Shall see the natural term of his career. His fears shall set a mark upon ye all, And on the morrow of some sleepless night He'll sacrifice you one by one, to soothe The slumbers of his next. Will you die thus, Or stand by those who have staked all for you? MARIO. Is there yet hope?â PROCIDA. Hope! never was there more. âBut that I used the moments yet our own To stir in ye the bravery of hope, Not desperation, I had spared this parley. Their late alarms my bondage will have hushed; It came too late. The springs of our design Have now their impulse, and the work will on. It was allotted me to spread our purpose, And marshal the assault, with all dispatch, Through the close-linked confederacy. 'Tis done! They seized me as I hastened to report it; Destruction stands bare-weaponed for her work, And but awaits her signal, which all hearts Are swelling to obey. Will ye shrink now? D'AQUILA. 'Tis plain we cannot! PROCIDA. If you do, You are the worst of traitors!âSacrifice Your lives like idiots,âcheat the people's fury, Which shall o'erwhelm, like the red waves of Etna, Tenfold their foes, if you betray them not To panic and confusion; and disgrace A cause which Fortune has proclaimed her own! SALVIATI. We shall succeed. D'AQUILA. I am resolved. FONDI. And I. LORIDAN. Then we are all resolved!â ALL. All, all! SALVIATI. We wait the signalâ PROCIDA. Ay, the vesper bell, The knoll of tyranny!âa sound shall waken The gratitude of ages free and happy. Fate urgesâand but waited that resolve Which now encircles me with steadfast hearts! See! the bright moon-beam on the dial shews We touch upon the moment! Firmly, then, And hopefully commend your swords to Heaven! (The bell sounds.) It sounds! Draw now, for Sicily and freedom! ALL. For Sicily and freedom! PROCIDA. Each man knows His post! LORIDAN. My victim's hereâI've sworn it! PROCIDA. Trust him! (A shout.) Away! (To Loridan.) We meet in Mainfroy's palace. [Exeunt Procida and Conspirators. LORIDAN. Ah! shall I rush upon his privacy, And stab him like a bravo! No! those lawsâ Those sacred laws of chivalry he taught me, Bid me disdain it. I'll await him here, Equipp'd for combat. Ha! he comesâunarm'd! Death to my hopes! Enter Montfort, in disorder. MONTFORT. What is this uproar? Whence The signs of death I have beheld? Where's Gaston? LORIDAN. Approach me not! MONTFORT. What mean you? LORIDAN. Hence!âavoid me! MONTFORT. What should I fear? LORIDAN. I have sworn to kill thee! MONTFORT (presenting himself.) Strike! LORIDAN. He palsies me. (inward struggle.) MONTFORT. If thou believ'st disloyally I've wrong'd thee, Convince thee at the bottom of my heart! LORIDAN. I am unmann'd. Thy genius is the stronger. I thought I hated thee; yet are thy foes Many and desperate! (Shout.) Hark! the storm is up. Rebellion rages, and its cause is mine. MONTFORT. Rebellion!âLet me fly! LORIDAN. Hold! thou art unarm'd! (Giving his sword.) This was thy gift, and was to win me honour; Take it again!âdie like a soldierâgo! If in the strife we meet, we meet as foes! MONTFORT. Agreed! And for thy gift we part as friends. (Offers his hand, Loridan takes it, much affected.) LORIDAN. Brave heart, away! Our arms are now at issueâ Thine for thy King, and for my country mine! [Exeunt severally. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. âA Street.âDistant Shrieks and Alarums. Enter several of the Populace armed, and headed by a Citizen. CITIZEN. This way! A second Citizen enters, meeting them. SECOND CITIZEN. Haste! haste! The Viceroy suddenly Hath gathered up a desperate band, and makes Fierce havoc where he goes. FIRST CITIZEN. Upon him! Villanelli enters. VILLANELLI. Hold! I charge you, spare himâhaste to save his life! He is surrounded in the palace, where He and his troop, closely beset, have made Their last retreat. Let him capitulate; And be his life your tribute to his virtues. My name is Villanelli; for whose wrongs This day a Frenchman fell beneath his swordâ A favourite of the king's, too;âyet he shed His blood for sacred justice. Even now Your wives and children must to-morrow toil To free us of the slaughter. Let one act Of signal mercy brighten in your annals So black a tale. MOB. We'll spare him! Let him live! VILLANELLI. Demand his life of Procida; whose coming They who surround the palace now await, At my entreaty, ere their flaming brands Doom to a dreadful fate a foe so noble. Procida comes! Enter Procida. PROCIDA. How now? MOB. Spare Montfort. PROCIDA. No! The honour of my house demands his blood. No mercy! Either he hath slain my son, Or by some sorcery accurst hath won him To perjury and treason. He must die! Where'er he goes his ready followers Assume a desperate courage and outface us. Should they by miracle prevail, you'll perish By a deliberate and hellish vengeance. Enter a Citizen. CITIZEN. Bring up all aid! The Viceroy and his band Have sallied forth, joined by the palace guards, And mock all efforts of our chiefs to stem Their daring course. [A Shout. PROCIDA. The trial, then, be ours. [Exeunt. SCENE II. An open space in the City. Alarums. Montfort enters, and encounters Procida. MONTFORT. So old, and yet so rash! Then thy black blood Must mingle with the stream thou hast let loose, And that way seek thy hell. PROCIDA. I sought but thee! Either the life or honour of my son Thus I avenge! (They fight. Procida totters; and as Montfort is about to strike him mortally, Loridan enters and intercepts him.) LORIDAN. Hold! PROCIDA. Loridan! LORIDAN. Stand firm! Foe to my father's life, defend thine own. MONTFORT. Guard thine! A traitor, and the friend of traitors, I meet thee now, and death alone can part us. [Exeunt, fighting. PROCIDA. Ha! Now he trifles not. They grapple now Like stubborn foes and deadly! Must I faint In such an hour, and for a sorry scratch? Enter Salviati and another. SALVIATI. This way they went. How now! Is't Procida? PROCIDA. Ay. SALVIATI. Art thou hurt? PROCIDA. Not much. 'Tis here. 'Twill leave no scar worthy the day 'twill tell of. Soâthe air freshens, and I breathe again. Follow my son; our last hope is with him. With Montfort he contends. SALVIATI. He will strive nobly. PROCIDA. See that he does. SALVIATI. You need assistance still. PROCIDA. Follow my son, I say! SALVIATI. And leave you thus Weak and defenceless! PROCIDA. Nay, then, follow me. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Vestibule of the Palace.âDarkness, dimly relieved by Moonlight in the perspective.âGleams, as from distant fires. Enter Leanthe. LEANTHE. Where do I wander?âeven my women shun me, As if they hid them from some dreadful doom That hangs o'er all; 'tis sure distempered fancy. A fearful trance hath suddenly enthrall'd My o'erwrought brain! Illusions terrible Visit my guilty soul for its offence!â Shouts have I heard; a wild turmoil of battle; Then women shrieked, and infants!âand anon 'Twas death-like silence, broken still with groans,â Some distant, some so near they freeze my blood!â And Montfort, too,âay, he that should have stayed To guard and pray for meâhe, too, is fled! But that each thought of him bewilders me, It seemed I saw him rushing through the streets, Bare-headed, and scared wretches fly before him! (Julia Villanelli enters.) Julia! thou comest to save me from distraction! JULIA. Let me embrace theeâfeel thy beating heart. Yes, yes, thou livest, and art but pale with fear. I thought I never should escape again The sight of death, staring and ghastly death! Oh! let me breathe awhile, and ease my terrors. LEANTHE. 'Tis done, then! Death and vengeance are abroad And I have set them on!âthou comest to say soâ To tell of Loridan and Montfort. Speak! The terror of my wild imaginings May bid the truth defiance! JULIA. For thy Montfort, None but his friends surround him, for his foes Fly headlong at his sight. Fear not for him; His valour shall restore him to you safe: I heard my husband's voice, too, clamouring aloud To have his life preserved! LEANTHE. His life!âfrom whom? JULIA. The citizens, the people, every man That calls himself Sicilian! 'Tis a work Of foul conspiracy, a bursting forth Of deadly hate long stifled. I had joined At the cathedral the assembled crowd, To do the holy duties Christians use Upon this solemn day; when, as the bell Had ceased the sounding of the vesper hour, A shout as of revolted demons shook The vaulted roof! Swords waved aloft, the priests Raised each his crucifix, and cried aloud, Revenge! revenge! And thenâoh! horrible! Beside, around me, butcheries were done It maddens me to think of. I distinguished, And 'twas Heaven's mercy, but a passing moment. Yet, ere all sense abandoned me, I saw Montfort appear like a descended angel; And at his name and aspect I perceived The murderers shrink and fly! I saw no more, Till from an icy stupor I awoke And all was hushed. The conflict and the crowd Had passed away; yet fearful things remainedâ Dead limbs encumbered me!âI heard the gasp Of still expiring wretches; and the beam Of some lone taper that the wreck had spared Shewed me their livid faces, and pale hands Convulsive grasping the scarce paler marble! A few affrighted women like myself Were tottering through the aisles, like guilty spirits Suffering their common penance; for 'twas all Too dreadful for humanity! With one Close link'd, to keep our mutual courage up, I ventured forth, and here took speediest refuge, Shuddering, and draggling through a path of blood! LEANTHE. Have mercy, Heaven! Loridan enters. LORIDAN. Still the yell pursues me! Inexorable father!âI have saved thee! Thee and my honour! Say'st not so, stern heart! Where art thou?âLaud me, for my soul is sickâ Mortally sick of its detested deed! JULIA. 'Tis Loridan! LEANTHE. I dread him! LORIDAN. Night of horrors! To thoughts like mine that ne'er shall usher morning, Ne'er shall they know a dawn of human peace! And yetâif he still liveâshall I notâ JULIA. Loridan! LORIDAN. What voice is that? JULIA. 'Tis Julia Villanelli. LORIDAN. Ha! thou hast courage!âthou hast human pity! Hear me! Beneath the cloister of St. Mark, Abandoned, lies a brave and noble Frenchman, Struck down, and yet, perhaps, not mortally. Call my attendants,âseek him. Here we'll hide him. Save him, and I will bless thee! JULIA. In the palace All is deserted. I have strength enough In such a cause. Come; you and I will go. LORIDAN. I dare not look upon him! VILLANELLI (without.) Julia! JULIA. Ha! my husband! With him I'll thither instantly. [Exit. LORIDAN (glancing at Leanthe.) Ha! who art thou? LEANTHE. A wretch whom Heaven had bless'd Had she been first the victim of your vengeance. Oh, Loridan! have mercy! Rest thou hereâ Play not the dark assassin! LORIDAN (wildly.) Get thee hence! LEANTHE. Oh, pity and forgive me! Friend and brother, Still art thou safe, and in an hour like this, May I not ask of thee the fate of Montfort? LORIDAN. No; there are murderers hereâI am a murderer! The murderers and the murder'd fill the landâ These hands are clamm'd with blood! LEANTHE. Oh, spare me!âspare me! LORIDAN. Away!âthy Montfort needs thee. Thou hast power, Perhaps, to save him. LEANTHE. Save him!âwhat base heart, What impious arm has dared toâ LORIDAN. Curse me not! His hand was raised against my father's life. (Here Montfort appears, tottering and exhausted, assisted by Julia and Villanelli.) Horrible vision! LEANTHE. Montfort!âpale and bleeding! Yet not to die! Despair not! Liveâyet live!â We'll heal thy wounds. MONTFORT. Leanthe!âheavenly kind! Thus to behold and hear thee brings indeed Unlook'd for comfort to my toiling spirit. All else is hopeless! LEANTHE. Say not so!âRecline thee. MONTFORT. Not for my life, but for my peace above Put up thy prayers. Oh, wherefore should I live To mourn my miserable countrymen, And gaze upon the scene that shall await To-morrow's dawn. No; in the common doom Heaven's mercy joins me. O'er my fading sight The clouds of death are gathering. Read there still, Ere all be dark, my gratitude to thee. Hold dear my memory, as thou dost thy Conradin's, And keep thy vow to Loridan. LEANTHE. Thy murderer! MONTFORT. No; 'twas he arm'd me for a soldier's death, And such a death he dealt me. Comes he not? JULIA. He is before you. LORIDAN (rushing forward towards him.) Montfort, can you bear To look upon a wretch who would redeem Thy life with years of anguish. Take once more My sword. Revenge thee, and forgive me. MONTFORT. Who dies but to forgive! Too many errors Will stand, I fear, in judgment on my memory. The ruler of a discontented land Hath not a charge of pastime. I have held it, Alas, too lightly! Learn, ye conquerors! Frail are your conquests, perilous your sway, Unfounded in the hearts of those ye conquer. Draw near me both. Let the King know me loyal, Nor e'er retaliate, for my country's honour, The rage of these Sicilians. Better far To fall as we fall than like them to conquer. (Dies.) LEANTHE. Ha! speak againâyet speak! No soundâno breath! Stand off!âI will not rave! Insatiate Death (stupor) Here too hath laid his icy hand. 'Tis welcome! To Montfort and to Loridan, farewellâ Farewell for ever! [Exit, led by Lady Julia. LORIDAN. Why, so, 'tis past! Let heaven and nature mourn, Black storm and whirlwind howlâthat marble smile Should mock their wailings. I have wept my last! VILLANELLI. These words become ye, Sir. This is no hour For sorrow's orgies, nor a night for slumber. Though here the foe is crushed, a band well arm'd, And strong in numbersâso the rumour runsâ Approach the cityâsummoned, as we deem, By Gaston, from Messina. LORIDAN. Stirring news! Well arm'd, too! They are foes a soldier seeks. I have a father, Sir; let him not blush for me. Follow me closeâa brave man be my witness I'm a Sicilian, and have slain my share. Here's massacre shall weigh against their thousands. I swore an oath to kill himâam I perjured? And now for havoc! Bring your ruffian hostsâ Ye whose accursed deeds his life hath paid, And heaps on heaps, in reeking hecatombs, Revenge his shade. [Exeunt. (Shouts.) SCENE IV. An outer Hall. Procida and other conspirators. PROCIDA. He must be found,âthrough all the palace seek him; He had an oath to Sicily, and does he Fail us at such an hour! New foes upon us, And this right arm grown powerless! Calumny Is busy with his name in all our streets! Ho! Loridan! Nor he nor his sworn foe, Living or dead, console these anxious eyes. Enter Salviati. SALVIATI. My lord, your patriot fears are at an end: Ranging the vacant palace, we have found The body of the Viceroy, pale and bleeding, His gallant spirit fled! PROCIDA. Is't so? That's much. My heart's disburdened of the worst. Haste now Where yet the strife is raging. Let me hear My son is in the midst. (Borella enters.) Hold! here are tidings. BORELLA. And of the best. The unexpected band Spread terror and defeat, when suddenly Your son, as if in envy of his Montfort, Rush'd, madly shouting, to the fight. On, on! Follow the traitor Loridan, he cried, For Procida and Sicily! All hearts Hail'd him, and follow'd. Every arm struck death Around his path, and he careers in lightning. PROCIDA. Your words are life to me. BORELLA. Our native archers Bring down the runaways,âthey choke our streets. Where'er a Frenchman shelters, sword and brand Still hunt him with exterminating wrath. PROCIDA. Brave tidings! Yet methinks our vengeance lingersâ Fate tampers with us! Come, we'll forth and front her. [Exeunt. SCENE V. A Square in the City.âAlarums.âConclusion of the Massacre âThe Stage and Terraces strewed with the dead. âThe Houses of the French consumed. Loridan enters, eagerly, yet tottering with debility; suddenly rests on his sword, unable to proceed. Villanelli, with other citizens and conspirators, with torches, follow and surround him. VILLANELLI. You strive in vain. Rest here! LORIDAN. My father! VILLANELLI. Your friends on every hand are seeking him. Behold, he comes! Enter Procida, Salviati, Borella, &amp;c. PROCIDA. My son! (Loridan seizes on his hand and falls.) How is it with thee? LORIDAN. Well; all now is well. The storm but sweeps away a blighted thing, Not worth the weeping for. Palermo's free, andâMontfortâis no more. Our name is not dishonoured! PROCIDA. Thou art the bravest of our race. I've wrong'd thee. LORIDAN. No! thou hast done thy noble name but justice. PROCIDA. Curse on the tyrant! Could I but restore The blood to that pale cheekâ LORIDAN. 'Tis freely shed! In the red torrent that oppression pours Thine own hath mingled; and if more of mine, My country's victory is at little cost. My heart's last wish my tongue now dares utterâ Thou wilt respect a hero's ashesâMontfort Shall be entombed with honour. PROCIDA. Else be Heaven Deaf to my prayers for thee, for Sicily! LORIDAN. 'Tis all I live to hear. (Dies.) PROCIDA (after a solemn pause.) Not less than this! Not less than this, my country! Oh, Loridan! My brave, unhappy boy! Art thou then gone for ever? Am I left Childless and lonely-hearted in my day Of pride and glory! Oh! my friends, forgive This gush of sorrow,âNature must awhile Subdue the patriot for a father's tears. (Suppressed but deep emotion; then recovering from the struggle with renewed energy.) Be ready with the dawn to crown our triumph! Martial salute. THE CURTAIN FALLS.</field>
