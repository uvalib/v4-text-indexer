      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE AND TRVLY NOBLE MINDED, JOHN CARY, VISCOVNT ROCHFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy Friend, Mr. Nathanael Richards, upon his well-written Tragedy of Messalina. When I beheld this Roman Tragedie, Where the mad sinne of Lust in Majestie And pow'r I saw attir'd, triumphantly, Guiding the Helme of doating soveraignty To her owne Compasse; I was pleas'd with it, Cause things immodest, modestly were write. Not in Prodigious Language that would start Into the Cheekes the suff'rings of the heart, And fright a Blush into a Feavour: tho Of late (shame to this Age) some have writ so. Had yours beene such, never should Pen of mine (Poore though my Muse) have lent you halfe a line. But now agen, recalling what you writ, How well adorn'd with words, and wrought with wit; I'le justifie the Language and the Plot Can neither cast aspersion nor spot On your cleane Fancie; But Apollo's Bayse Growes green upon your Brow to crowne your praise. Then for this Tragedy, securely rest, 'Tis current Coyne, and will endure the Test. Stephen Bradwell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my true Friend Mr. Nathanael Richards in due praise of his Tragedy of Messallina. Friend, y'ave so well limn'd Messallina's lust T'were pitty that the Peece should kisse the dust Of darke Oblivion; you have (I confesse) Apply'd a due Preservative the Presse. Y'are now sayl'd forth o'th Narrow Sea, the Stage, Into the world's wide Ocean, where the rage Of Criticisme, it's utmost will extend To buffet your new Barke: But feare not Friend, She's so well built, so ballac't, so well man'd With Plot, with Forme and Language that shee'l stand The storme; and having plough'd the Seas passion, Will Anchor safe i'th Rhode of approbation: Where judgements equall hand shall moare her fast, And hang a Lawrell-Garland on her Maste. Robert Davenport.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Friend Mr. Nathanael Richards, upon his Tragedy of Messallina. If it be good to write the truth of ill And Vertues excellence, 'tis in thy skill (Respected Friend) thy nimble Scenes discover Romes lust-burnt Emp'resse and her vertuous Mother So truly to the life; judgement may see, (Praysing this Peece) I doe not flatter thee. Men here may reade Heaven's Art to chastise Lust; Rich Vertue in a Play, so cleare; no rust, Bred by the squint ey'd critickes conquering breath Can e're deface it; Messallina's death Adds life unto the Stage; where though she die Defam'd; true justice crownes this Tragedy. Jo. Robinson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Friend the Author Mr. Nathanael Richards on his Tragedy of Messallina. For this thy Play (deare Friend) I must confesse Thy Plot's contriv'd with such misteriousnesse As if Fate turn'd the Scene; thy Language can Expresse thee a Divine and Morrall Man, The Musicke of thy Numbers might entice Time's glorious Harlot from her lust-stung vice. This is to shew my judgement, who will say (That findes my approbation of this Play) I want needefull knowledge? It shall be Sufficient praise for me, I can praise thee. 'Tis judgement to know judgement, and I find Most of our Playhouse wits, are of my minde. Men call them Censurers a stocke of brothers, Thought wise by praysing and dispraysing others: Bid them write Playes themselves, &amp; then you'l foyle 'em; The'yl say they can't finde time, yes time to spoyle 'em. Thou art above their aymes, who dislikes this Must be a Goose, or Serpent: let him hisse. Tho. Iordan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his worthy Friend Mr. Nathanael Richards, upon his Tragedy of Messallina. Behold a Poet whose laborious Quill Dictates his Makers prayse, above the skill Of times Earth-minding Idolls muddy straine (Base as the things they immitate) thy veine (Approved friend) strikes dead the impious Times Adored Vices and high raised Crimes Which pulls swift vengeance downe; thy labour'd lines Curbs Vice, crownes Vertue, gold from drosse refines All gazing eyes may see thy Anchorite Muse Delights in a conversion, not abuse Romes mightie Whore by thee adornes the Stage: For to convert not to corrupt this Age. And they that (Messallina) thus pend sees Must praise the Authors candor, thriftie Bees Suck Hony out of weeds, her actions may Have miracles for issue, if y'obay Your jogging consciences that whispering say, Be rul'd by this, instructing (Tragicke) Play.

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. To write a Tragedy is no such ease As some may thinke, 'mongst whom ther's a disease Still of dislike, censuring what ere is writ With ignorance; onely to be thought a wit. Playes are like severall meates, their strange effects So different prove, some carelesly neglect What others long for, that which surfets thee, Another sayes tis good, gives life to me. What's to be done? the way to please you all Requires an Art, past Magick naturall. Our best endeavours still with Comick fare Have striv'd to please; now all our cost and care, Soares on the wings of labour'd industrie; To feast your sences with the Tragedy Of Roman Messallina, the Play is new, And by Romes fam'd Historians confirm'd true. We hope you'l not distaste it, nor us blame, Where spots of life are acted to sinnes shame. Tell me I pray? can there be no content? To see high towring sinnes just punishment And Vertues prayse; insatiate lust to die, And chast Dames star'd unto Eternitie, Will not this please? if any answer no, I, let that soule and all the world to know, Your loves the marke we ayme at, all our might, Shootes at your love, labours to hit that white.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 1. SCENE. 1. Enter Silius reading in a Booke. Sil. Sola virtus vera nobilitas. Vertue is onely true nobilitie, So speakes our times best Tutor Seneca, And 'tis divinely spoken, like himselfe. True Philosopher, for what is't to man For to be borne noble, and yet detaine Th'ignoble mind of vice, licentious will, Such no way are alide to noblenesse. Times hellbred, base, ignoble noble blood, Runnes through his veines, thats only great not good. Farre better live a private life with thee, Thou sweete companion to Well-minded man. Here's no seducing Pompe, no clouds of vice, Nor fogges of vanitie obscures mans sight From the direct to wayes directly ill. This seale confirme the sequell of my life To immitate the good that thou presents. Kisseth the Booke. Enter Valens and Proculus. Val. Still plodding at your Book, shall we ne'r find You otherwise; Pox of this sad mutt'ring To your selfe; hang't up, 'tis a disease to Sweet alacritie, of all true joviall Minds to be abhord, come.— Offers to take away the Booke. Sil. Prethe disist. Pro. How scurvily this shewes, how ill in you, That Should be fram'd just of the times fashion. Sil. Thats learning, and valour; or should be so At least; and not in outsides fond delight, Whereon Times Puffe-paste costly coxcombe, all His great little wit, and wealth, thinkes best bestow'd To please his Mistri's Eye; when all mans minde Should bend his course to follow virtues steps. Val. Out upon't; drinke me and whore; those are The vertues best, and best accepted 'mong Gallants of this age. Sil. Th'are gallant sots, Silly and senselesse; what's all the delight, That seemes so pleasing to the itchie whor'er? But like the Itch, scratch't raw, 'tis still the sorer 'Twill smart to purpose; make you to find out An obscure grave, cold as the snowy Alpes, There, in a hollow circle of the night Lust breeds more cause of terrour then delight. Pro. Fie Cajus fie, turn'd Satire gainst your friends, Sil. Alas y'are blind my friends, and I am sorry. Val. Pish; wer't not for sparkling beauty, pretious woman, Woman I say, that faire and winning creature, Whose ne'r to be resisted delicate touch, Divides us into all the sweets of sense, Wer't not for her, (glorious sweet fac'd woman,) Man makes no use of his Creation, What saies our Roman phrase, Si non lætaris vivens lætabere nanquam. Leave then this puling study and be rul'd. Hang up Philosophy that Sceane of sorrow, Come goe with me to beauties faire abode, There, if you'l make true tryall of your strength, Let it be there imploy'd; doe but withstand The catching beauties there, and spight of all Their powerfull charmes and incantations Come freely off, untainted with the Act. For ever Ile abjure to be seduc'd By the worlds quainte enticements; betake me Wholly to Philosophy, and practise The same in life. Pro. So shall Proculus. Sil. O were I sure that sworne you'd keepe, &amp; not Infringe your vowes (though noble wisedome bids, To shunne the glorious strumpets licorish snares,) You soone should finde me sudaine, dare to stand, The baites of whoorish fortitude unmoov'd. Val. Talke not but do't. Pro. Therein consists the Test Of compleat man. Sil. Then on this booke take Oath, Sweare that by all the good therein contain'd, And all that's good the vertues of true Man, At my returne free from adultr'ate sinne To live true friends to vertue ever after You shall prevaile. Both. We sweare. Vall. So deepely sweare That may Ioves thunder strike when we forsake Our vowes. Sil. Tis well, lead on; And if I ever prove False to Syllana punish me great Iove. Exeunt. Enter Veneria the Bawd, Calphurnia, Hem and Stitch, Panders. Bawd. Hey ho, what Hem, Hem, Hems, vvhat Hem I say. Hem. Here Mistresse. Bawd. Stitch, oh Stitch. St. In your side Madam. Bawd. No Stitch, orethwart my heart, O I shall die; The bottle, the bottle, the bottle knave the bottle. Shee drinkes. Cal. Doe doe drinke and be fatter still up with't, Why so my brave bundle of guts and garbish. Bawd. I you may well say drinke, well may I drink All sorrow from my heart, for I thanke you Ten thousand sesterces, this day is lost To our victorious Empresse Messallina; Messallina Claudij Cæsaris conjux hanc regalem existimans palam elegit in id certamen nobilissimam e prostitutis ancillam mercenarie stipis eamque die ac nocte superavit quinto ac vicesimo concubitu. Plin. lib. 10. cap. 62.Witnesse the Number five and twentie, All in the circuit of a day and night, And yet shees ready for a new delight. Cal. She may, for who but shee dares do the like, For a poore subject, halfe the number serves, On greatest Queenes most servants still attends. Bawd. Hadst not provocations to enable thee, Confection of Cantharides, Diasaterion Eringoes, Snailes, Oysters, Alligant, and could not these Make thee hold out with five and twentie; 'Twas but a Forenoones worke, a forenoones worke You paltry puling. Cal. I, in your young dayes. Bawd. In my young dayes, I tell thee small Flounder, Old as I am and fat, I durst yet wager, To lay twice the number of such shrimpes as thee, That they should ne're rise more. Cal. Yes with a Pox. I have not the Court art to kill my lovers, Nor draw them on with witchcraft, Circean charmes, Nor is it lust, but want makes me a trader, And those I clip with, I must like at least, Let Romes brave Empresse do her liking, Stitch. I she's a brave Roman dame indeed. Hem. And those Mad-dames are the best doers Stitch. Cal. Calphurnia loathes varietie of men, Times big bone Animalls so apt to please, Th'Empresse will whets not my appetite, Besides you know I'me not for durance, Wanting the daily visits of best Doctors, To make me broths of dissolv'd Pearle and Amber, Which well considered will not quit the cost, She won the wager, I am glad I lost. Bawd. Glad I have lost, Let me come to her, Ile claw you Minkes, glad I have lost, and which goes nearest my heart; To raile, and none to raile against but tall Proper and goodly able men, calling Them big-bond Animals, O blasphemy. Why Phisgig; must I keepe thee rich in cloathes, To want that ever pleasing sweet, Hony, and Sugar candy delight; which the Bravest high spirited glistering Ladies, (Such as make Punies of their pettie Lords) Account their heaven, their onely happinesse, Never but discontented when they are Out of Action; and are you defective now; Fallen out (forsooth) with the felicitie You shu'd take in man; O most absurd, Not to be suffer'd, utter'd, nor indur'd, It is intollerable; it is, it is, it is, Thou muddy minded piece of mischiefe it is. St. Hem, Mistris, here comes our fellow Pander The Lord Sausellus. Hem. All of a house, but not all fellowes Stitch, And yet we hope to be Sir Panders; nay since Great-ones be of that profession, and thrive so by it, It cannot chuse but be a brave profession. St. Oh, tis a good, A goodly brave profession; 'tis the best, Best streame to sish in, be ne'r so impious, Gold stiles the royall villaine vertuous. Sauf. Here, here my most pretious procurers Downe, and adore our royall Empresse, And me the messenger of these glad tidings; Proud is her highnesse of the wager wonne, Yet scorning the advantage of the losse Trebly returnes your owne, with a reward, And signe of her high favour ever after. Ba. I hope her mightinesse receiv'd content, And will make bold with my poore house hereafter. Sauf. Yes, with your house a little bold her yet, Silius comes hither straight brought by his friends Valens and Proculus, your best wills worke, To make him serve her pleasure. Ba. Pleasure her, What? Silius a private gentleman of Rome And be so grosse as not to pleasure her. Which of you gallants wu'd not pleasure an Emp'resse; that a man should be so very a sot As not do, Oh 'twere abominable. Sauf. But hee's a man of precise abstinence, And hardly will be drawne by any woman. Ba. Hoy day; not drawne by woman sayd you, If he come here, he shall be hang'd and drawne, And dry drawne to; not drawne by a woman! Gogs nigs that's fine ifaith. Sauf. See, here they come prepar'd; I must withdraw For a more apt imployment, shew your skills, Women through lust and Hell will worke their wills. Exit. Enter Silius, Valens, Proculus. Val. Come, Sir, wee'l enter you. Sil. Most certaine Into the divels vaulting schoole; where lust In triumph rides or'e shame and innocence, Am I not in Hell. Pro. O silly Silius. Cannot a sweet shap't gallant like my selfe, Enter the house where Venus vestalls live But it must needs be Hell, ha, ha, ha. Ba. Welcome Princely Spirits, Sweet faces, rich cloathes, and exquisite bodies, Make you for ever (my most curious clients) Pruriently, pleasing to the blood of beautie, Hem and Stitch some stooles and cushions quicke. Sil. What have you brought me to your Sempsters house. Ba. These are no idle persons. Sil. Is this your lusty kindred, sweet pleasure Which angles soules to hell, as men hooke fish; I, this is she the bane of all devotion, She whose inticements turnes weake men aside From the right way of vertue, throwing em downe Into the gulfe of all confusion; From whence me thinks those dreadfull soules I heare Now at this instant cursing of your Sex; Your sinne affected trimings to entice Which implicates the wretched mind of man Crying with horrour 'gainst your impudence. O woman, woman, thy bewitching motion, Fooles wisedome, reason, and blinds all devotion. Ba. What is the man detracted from his wits tro. Sil. Out thou devourer up of maiden heads Ba. Hoy day, I a devourer of maiden heads, That (with joy be it spoken) I have not bad A maidenhead these fiftie yeares. Vall. Prethee be not thus bitter unto 'em, Poore necessary evils they pleasure us. Sil. Out on your beastly, your most senselesse pleasures, That makes you reasonlesse, esteeming best Those things delight you most. Cal. O I could stand, My lifetime here to heare this Silius raile. Sil. Note but the end of all your lustfull pleasures, All breed diseases, griefes, reproaches foule, Consumption of the body, and the soule, Engender sorrowes and sotishnesse, Forgets all prudence: growes most insolent, Breeds th'Epelepsie that falling evill; Begets murder, makes a man a divell, O're throwes whole families, confounds the just, Foisteth in children illigitimate, Corrupts all humane sweet societie. The various paths of lust are all uneven, Her pleasures dreadful plagues the scourge of heaven. Enter Emperesse and Saufellus attending with a cap. Emp. Our soveraigne good is pleasure unto which None can attaine but valiant men and wise. Sil. Oh. Sil. fals on his knees. Emp. Silius thou shalt not fall unlesse I fall, Nor rise without me, we love thee Cajus Thou soule of musicke breath, breath and enchant. Musicke. With thy delicious Tones while thus we bend, And health our love mirrour of men to thee. She drinkes. Sil. Foole that I am, thou hast undone thy selfe, Keepe in my vertue or this fiery triall Flames thee to Cindars. Emp. Fill for him, ist prepar'd? Sauf. With deepest Art. Emp. Here pledge, and pledge freely, a heatty draught (As I began) up witht; so tis well, this, Sil. drinks. This fayling, pure, precise one now is silenc'd, Conveigh him to our bed, Natures delight Where when he wakes he may admire and burne Be mad in love to pleasure free in us. Thanks Valens, and Proculus, Cæsar dispatcht To Ostia, wee'l finde fit time to make you Shine in glory, all shall finde rich rewards. Exit Emperesse and Saufellus. Ba. May you for ever glister like the Sunne. Val. Silius y'are snar'd; and we our wager wonne. Exit. Hoboyes. Enter Emperour, Claudius, Messallina Narcissus, Pallas, Calistus, Saufellus, with attendance. Emp. Swift nimble time the season of the yeare (To offer sacrifice unto the Gods) Calls us with speed from Rome to Hostia, in Which our absence, sweet, deare then my life, We doe implore, use all the carefull meanes That may preserve that life and happinesse Thy love assures us; which if want of health Should bate thee joy; Cæsar were not himselfe Disaster, griefes, diseases pale and wan Wu'd make me marble, such is th'affiance, The strong perswasion of that love I beare To thee thou starre on earth my onely blisse Beare record heaven, blesse thou this parting kisse. Exit Emperour, cum suis. Mess. Farewell my life, my love, my royall, Foole Shallow braine fop, dull ignorance adeiu, The kindest Cuckold woman ever knew. Saufellus draw nigh, Now is the wisht for time to crowne delight Turne night to day and day into the night, Prepare for stirring, Masque, midnight revells All rare varietie to provoke desire; Then haste and fetch those envide Adamants Rome most admires for foolish chastitie, When we have graspt them here, surfeits riot Shall squeese their spungie vertue into vice. If they deny to come, let vengeance fall Like to that all devouring thunders flame Which fierd the world, be mercilesse and kill. Rome shall take notice, our incensed blood, Like to Medusa's shall to Serpents turne, Poys'ning the Ayre, where locall chastitie Claymes least preheminence. Sauf. Spoke like your selfe beyond thought excellent O it becomes you rarely; thinke what you are All glory drosse is, in comparison Of that all rare inestimable worth, You truly owe; all admir'd beautie past, And that to come with full attractive force Have fixt their lively characters in you. Divinest faire; earth breathes not such another, Twere madnesse longer your delights to smother: I'me fierd with joy to see your high blood free. Continue with encrease, adde flame to flames. Burne high bright glorious wonder of thy Sex, Act what your thoughts shall prompt too, I in all Am onely yours at whose commanding will Ile death and horrour wade to save or kill. Offers to goe. Mess. Stay er'e you goe resolve us; what is that Stagerites Name, he that last night i'th play Did personate the Part of Troylus. Sauf. Menester (glorious Empresse) thats his name. Mess. Menester how that name works on my blood And like a violent Tyde, swells me with full Desire to know the man; it must be so Command him to attend our will to night. Sauf. Know mightie Queen I by your looks perceiv'd The gracefull Actor pleasing to your eyes, And therefore already here in court, I Have prepar'd him. Mess.

We long for change to feede on various fruit; Vp Messalina let thy mountaine will Too long kept downe, fly to thy full desire, Ile live in pleasure though I burne in fire. Exit. Enter Saufellus with a Torch, Menester following. Sauf. Come, come, come, this way, fie how I sweat, This venery is a stirring businesse, Remaine you here, Ile instantly returne. Exit. Men. My heart that ne're yet shrunk begins to throb, And my good Genius whispers in mine eare A faire retreat; I am faire warn'd, and yet I waver doubtfull. Sauf. Fortunate Actor, Now let thy best of action to the life Court Romes rare Emp'resse to the height of pleasure, Muster up all the powers of man in thee To an united strength, prepare a part To ravish, pleasure winne an Empresse heart, Looke to't, prove active to yeeld full content, Or else you die, die a most shamefull death, So speed as you shall please. Exit. Men. That's certaine death, I, I that in Pompeys, spacious Theater Acted the noble vertues of true man, When the faire piercing lines so much prevail'd, I felt a sacred flame runne through my braines, And in this Orb of mans circumference, My selfe at furious war within my selfe, That in my lifes sweet sequell, I still striv'd Wrestled with flesh and blood to immitate The good I then presented, but now, a Coward plague, or else some Fiend rais'd from the Pit of feare, hath all my goodnesse to a Period dropt; and I like chaffe, blowne on this Wide worlds stage, am now to act my owne part, Which must be vicious now, lust stung vicious With Romes majesticke Empresse, whose command Strikes dead in the refusall, dead; a word That quakes even the most valiant He, though least Exprest, if by escape I thinke my selfe Secure in some remote soile, her revenge Will with the selfe same stroake there strike me dead, 'Mong petty emminent persons now tis Common; then Princes cannot faile, their Armes Are long and large, compulsion bids me on Who ere shall reade my story then shall say 'Tis forc'd compulsion, and not rich reward, No high Court favourers made Menester sinne.

Presenting his naked Poniard. Goe the influence of whose power starres, Mounts thy imperiall lot to set aloft On the high Orbe of our affection, Like the bright rising orientall Sun, When it salutes Aurora; 'bove the choice Of five and twentie Iove-like Ganimends, Who charm'd, and wrapt in wanton dalliance, Life fir'd with admiration; O pleasing, More pleasing sweet to my insate desire, Then was to Synon Illions loftie fire. Mess. Shall Messallina in her flourishing youth Like dull and tame, Nobilitie live coopt, Confin'd and mew'd up singular to one; No Cæsar no t'were fooles Philosophy, And I abjure't; there is no musick in't, Those of our Sex the mindes of sots containe And are of no brave spirits that deny Pleasure, the heaven of my Idolatry. Enter Saufellus and Lepida. Lep. Plagues yet unfelt light on thee mischievous Slave, villane, dog murderer rot as thou livest. Mess. Mother the cause of your distemprature. Lep. Murder in thee, in thee thou wicked Impe And that thy substitute by the ordain'd Gainst the most noble mindes of chastitie, Whose innocent blood like th'Atlantick sea Lookes red with murder, and cries out to heaven For justice and revenge; O hadst thou first Then beene the Author of so foule a fact Made thy owne passage, happy woman I. Mess. Beldame give or'e, or Ile disclaime all smoothnesse, Ther's nothing done that's wisht undone by us. Lep. Ist even so, then too too ill farewell Truths story shall relate to after times My love to thee; hate to thy desp'rate crimes. Mess. Pish to your chamber dotard be advis'd. Sauf. Goe and a mischiefe dambe you, and all your Pittifull Sex. Mess. We doe commend thy care, Ioy 'ith performance of our strict command, Which shall from hence forth stile thee favorite To us, that will command thy fortunes rise. Sauf. And all those fortunes, favours, life and all, Shall like an Atlas undergoe the weight Of your imperious will, be it toth' death Of Parents, massacre of all my kin, To exceede the divell, act any sinne. Mess. For which we thus enseame thee, Kisses him. Sauf. O Dulce, Divinest goddesse whom my soule adores, Multiply that sweet touch of rare delight, And from the Garden of Hesperides, Those delicate delicious rubie lips, Make me immortall, quench, quench the burning heat Which like th'immoderate thirst of Tantalus, (Scorching the medowes of my solid flesh) Dries up the Rivers of my crimson blood, And as the gaping tongue tide earth for raine Opens her griefe, so in my lookes behold, View my distresse; make me to live or die. Mess. Graspe me Saufellus; lets have a sprightly dance, Swift footing apts my blood for dalliance. Sauf. Musicke, rich musicke there; O that my skill Could transcend mortall. Mess. Tush: wee'l accept thy will. Dance a Coranto. Enter Lepida. Sauf. What divell sends her back, Mess. Pish minde her not. Lep. Nature constraines me back, what though dismai'd Shall I desist, O then shees lost for ever, No; I will bend with fairest faire demeane. To save her soule I'le make my foot my head, Mothers were Monsters else not truly bred, Give my speech once more freedome. Mess. You'l force us through unmannerly exclaimes To rest the strictnesse of our dread command Lep. I come not bent with wrath, but to implore On bended knees, with penitentiall teares, T'appease the Gods for thy full Sea of sinne, Such is a mothers love, and such is mine; Prove thou my like, thy soule shall never fall Into those damned sinnes it nourisheth; Which like a ponderous Argosey full frought, Cuft on the mountaine top of some bigge wave, In the descent, falls on the fearefull Rock And splits in peeces irrecoverable, So fatall death upon the wings of night Whirles the blacke soule in her triumphant Car To the Tartarian vales; where crown'd in flames, Tumbling descend to dreadfull Orcus Cell, That mercilesse pit of bottomlesse despaire, To fry in those blew flames of feare for ever, In never ending endlesse paine for ever. If mothers teares were e're of force to move, Let these of mine take place; strive to repent, Thinke what a horrid thing it is to see There is feare above us; feare still beneath us, Feare round about, and yet no feare within us. Mess. I doe begin to melt. Lep. Heavens blessings on thee. Sauf. And hells curse on thee; tis high time to speak, O be your selfe divinest faire on earth, This idle superstitious lecturing Proceeds of malice; what? to make you childe And slave to her desires. Lep. O impious devill. Mess. No more, live and be thankfull. Exit. Mess. and Saufel. Lep. Ha, howes that? Live and be thankfull; am I then contemn'd Is all my labour in a moment lost. Live and be thankfull; sure I doe but dreame, It cannot be, nature against it selfe Should so rebell; O foole, foole that I am With vaine hope thus to play the flatterer. Mors ærumnarum quies; mors omnibus finis. Dissolve the glassie pearles of mine eyes, That Niobe-like I may consume in teares, And nevermore behold day light agen. Pish, all this is but talke; and talke I must, Fly from me soule and turne my earth to dust. Must I then live to see my daughters shame. Crack, crack poore heart; sterne death let fly thy dart, Send my sad soule to the Elizium shades That there it might drinke Lethe, and forget It ever liv'd in this mortallitie. Parcæ dispatch; when, when I say; no, no, Falls distracted. Then will I act Medeas murd'ring part Vpon my staine of blood, that gods and men May sit and laugh, and plaudite my revenge. Ye dismall sisters of the fatall night, Rise, rise, and dance hells roundelaies for joy, Rhamnusia finds imployment for you all. Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow. Note with your grim aspects the courts of Kings, See how the politicke statesman for his ends, Sits hammering mischiefe; and how Toad-like swels Bombaste with treasons riches; see ther's lust, Brave Madam, lust temptations painted whore Divinely worshipt by the bastard brood Of knaves and fooles. Ye dread and irefull furies i'ft not true. Why then imploy your burning whips of steele, Lash with eternall lashes, there, there, there, Excellent Furies how you doe excell, So, so, so, so, tis holy day in hell. Syllana drawne out upon a Bed as sleeping to whom Silius with a light Torch enters. Sil. O what a fiery combate feeles my soule, The Genius good and bad that waights on man, Shakes natures frame, trembles this Microcosme, There vertue pleads for sleeping innocence, For love, true love, chast thoughts, and vertuous acts Which entertain'd within a constant brest Makes man triumphant crown'd immortall blest. But O the pondrous plummets of blacke vice, Suppresse those pure imaginations, Which breake like lightning onely for a flash, Wanting the true materiall to impell, And to continue this false clocke of life From its exorbitant course; such like are Majesticke title, and the Empresse, That unpeer'd excellence, bevvitching dalliance, Soule of temptation sweete, so charmes all sense, Vertue I loath, like politick states whose good Depends on ill, worke their attempts in blood. Syla. O my affrighted soule art thou there sweet, Then am I safe; t'was but a dreame I see, A waking walking in my sleepe wherein, Me thought I saw neare to a River side, Two lovely Turtles sit, like morne in May, Adorn'd with all the glories of the Spring, Their loves to either seem'd to sympathize, And with such sober chastitie connex, That their two hearts (as true loves ever should, Like fire and heate inseperate a like) Shew'd like the splendor of a heart that liv'd In sacred flames; in unextinguisht flames Of chast desires, free from the tainted spot Of petulent dalliance, till temptations snare Appear'd Parthenope like; that with her charmes Work't so effectuall on the Turtle Male, He (like Troy, firebrand, falsly that forsooke Vnpitied Oenon) not alone content, Alone forlorne, t'abjure his lovely mate, But back return'd his black intents to further, And to the height of lust he added murther The very thought seem'd daggers to my brest, That with the feare I wakt. Sil. To sleepe thy last. Presents his lomard to her. Syl. Light of my life how's that? Sil. Briefly this; I'le be your dreames expositor thou must die; Die by this hand, this fat all instrument Nor must I seeme to yeeld a slave to pittie. Sil. Sure, sure I dreame, dreame still, if not tell, O Tell me my better selfe, whose killing words, Wounds crueller then death; what cause, what offence What ill desert in me, that wrong'd you never, The Gods me witnesse beare. Sil. Tis for no fault sustain'd on thy behalfe, No; tis the Empresse Doome. Syl. She; nay then. Sil. 'Tis shee; that modell of creation, Must through thy death participate alone All that is man in me; And to that end With sweetest concord of discording parts, Out sings the Syrens, fiers this mansion With haut, Ambition, Romes imperiall crowne, And therefore I must kill; or else forgoe All those bright shining glories, which what foole Would be so nice. Syl. Is there then no hope, No comfort, no remorse; must I depart Where I shall never see thy face agen, Never behold those joyes, which Hymens Rites Were wont to crowne with true loves flames, Is there no remedy. Farewell vaine world, my life is such a toy, I will not wish to live, t'abate thee joy. Yet er'e I goe, grant this one courtesie, 'Tis the last kindnesse you shall ever give, Place gainst my heart thy deadly pointed steele, So, now farewell; death is for me most meet, Strike sure and home, I doe forgive thee sweet. Sil. Bravely resolv'd, and I'le performe thy will As bravely thus, Pretending a violent stab he flings away the Poniard. Not to be Emp'rour of the spacious earth, Live, live Syllana free. Syl. Ist possible, Twixt feare and hope strucke, through with deepe amaze I waver doubtfull. Sil. Cease admiration And be sure of this, though I must confesse I hither came Arm'd with a full intent To take thy life, yet Silius ne'r shall adde To his libidinous life, a murderers name. Of ills, 'tis ever best, the worst to shanne, By murders murderers soules are oft undone; I wish I were farre better then I am, Neque Silius fagitii aut periculi nescius erat; sed certo si abnueret exitio, &amp; nonnulla fallendi spe, simul magnis præmiis, opperiri futura, &amp; præsentibus frui pro solatio habebat, Tacit.But since without my most assured ruine It cannot be; being so faire ingag'd Into the Empresse favour, I must on Make use of some devise cloakt with deceit, That farre beyond perswasion may enforce Thy deaths beleefe. Syl. Kill, O kill me rather. Be not far crueller to thy selfe then death To put to hazard on so slight a ground Thy life for mine; I know the Emp'resse That if least notice of my life she heare, Not irefull Nemesis in swift revenge Could be more speedy. Sil. Pish, I will so worke You shall not neede to feare, therefore as I, At court with my continuance must make way To cleare suspect; use you the matter so Among your noble Family whereby Argos ey'd Envie descrie me not; I Shall securely live dreadlesse of danger. Syl. Though you had struck my body full of wounnds And I survive, my fierce revenge should be Good against ill, how to preserve your life. Sil. Th'art the true Emblem of a perfect wife, For whose rare vertue, from my soule I wish All husbands were the same, in that right way A perfect husband truly ought to be. Which since in me (ordain'd by powerfull Fate) Never to be avoyded backward runnes, Let my recursion from thy mind expell, That Serpent foe to life; sad griefes extreame. As grossely vaine in being remedilesse, and Therefore shunne it, patient conjuence Is the calme of trouble, best cure gainst care, Gives greatnesse best content in meane estate. Why doe I then (like Godlesse villains) tell, The way t'heaven, yet lead the path to hell. Mindes that will monnt into superiour state, Climbe mischiefes Ladder; vertuous actions hate. Yet ist not so with Silius; I doe love Those vertues in another, though I want The like performance; nor shall my high ayme, Rais'd on advancements top doe me more good, Then th'injoyning free from the act of blood. But I protract delay, ther's danger in't; Video meliora, proboque, deteriora Sequor. Never was man so infinitely Bewitcht; charm'd, and inchanted as is Caius Silius, to leave a constant wife; farewell, We must part. Syl. Must, must, O wretched word of Mischievous command; must we part. Sil. We must; nay prethee weepe not sweet, Syl. Blessings like drops of raine shower on thy soule, O that I might part dying in thine armes. Sil. Farewell. Syl. Farewell. Sil. Teares want their remedy, There is no striving, gainst our destinie.

My brother gone to exile and I here, So neare the Empresse Court, the Court of shame, Where mischiefes hourely breed; how strange seemes this, I have a will to follow, yet I want My wills performance; not that I am sicke, Wanting, or limbes, or libertie; which begets More strange immaginations, yet all I can. Comes short to guesse th'inscrutable meaning That thus deteines me here, in vaine, in vaine: The more I strive my senses I confound, Then give it o're, salute thy mother earth, Lies downe. And rest, rest while thy poore distracted minde Vpon the wings of thought takes flight and flie Fly to the lland of Coreyra there, Learne the soules comfort sweete Philosophy, What infinite good 'tis to contemplate heaven, For to that end the life of man is given. Enter Montanus in disguise. Mon. Prove prosperous my designe upon this Brother to the banisht Seneca, Are you cought Sir? Snatcheth Mela's Sword from behind him. Mel. Ha, villaine what art thou. Mon. A murderer and villaine, O Sir, 'Tis the best thriving trade and best imployd 'Gainst such malevolent Satyrists as you You that are all for vertue, a meere word, When indeede ther's no such thing; say there be None truly loves it but dies beggerly. Mel. Slave, rather dispatch me then torment my soul With thy envenom'd scoffes 'gainst that that is Most rare, most excellent. Mon. A little more, And then I'le speede you, excellent Ladies Cannot disable with a charming spell, (A trick of wit, a humour that they have) Husbands they not affect; making free way For Atlas backs to leape their lovely lappes, But your Satyricall censure straight must passe, Th'ones pride's scabd-hammd Rascalls, and the others Mischiefes veneriall Trulls; these are fine tearmes, Pray who made you a censurer of manners. Mel. O slave, Mon. T'upbraid such emminent persons What madnesse durst the like, deserv'st not death, Yes, yet your life is safe, passe but your vow T'embrace a beautie I shall bring you to, (More delicate then was the Spartan Queene) One that shall pay large tribute night by night, Give thee thy weight in gold for each delight. Mel. Not I, I yeeld my body mercenary slave To lust and lucre, no, though mines of gold She could give oftner then those whorish lookes Women take pride in, to bewitch mens soules; First partch't to Cinders, 'gainst the burning Zone, Be buried quicke, all torments possible, (Stretcht on the Tenters of invention) I gladly would (most willingly) endure E're thy soule killing proffers enters here. Mon. No? Mel. Pish, for my death, ther's too much man in me To feare so sleight a scratch; let it come, I will no budg a foote; strike faire and home, Tis better die then live to live unjust, Slave to th'unsounded Sea of womans lust. Mon. Are you so confident, have at you Sir, Offers to runne at him and flings downe the Weapon. Your love, your love, 'tis onely that I seeke I am no villaine, though I seem'd in show But one that fearefull in these dangerous times For to retaine a friend; led on by hope Of your faire life, whom envie in your foes Reports no lesse of; caus'd me through disguise, To put to tryall your unvalued worth, Which beyond man I find of such pure mold, Sun-like your vertues outshine purest gold. Mel. Beleeve me Sir ther's no such thing in me Worthy your least Encomium. Mon. But there is A miracle, which but in me in part, Through friendships deare respect incorporate. And you shall binde me everlastingly To blesse the houre we met. Mel. As I am slow, To friendships confidence (as tis requisite For ev'ry one, and yet once enter'd in Affect stabilitie, judge you the same, A man that truly sensative well knowes, Vertue to be but meerely adjective; Wanting that soveraigne sweetnesse which directs The minde to honest Actions; and therefore, As friendship joynes with vertue; truly is, The lover of love; each true friends propertie, By that true blessing, sundry, wills connexion Our hearts as hands unite, dilate affection, That th'enlarge length, orbicular may spread And ne'r finde end. Mon. So am I yours. Mel. You mine. Mon. Vnparallel'd is that love where friends combine. Enter Valens, Proculus, Menester. Here comes the top top gallants of the time. Mel. The fooles of the time; how are we bound to heaven Exempt the bondage of these Palace Rats, These, whose delights are last provocatives. Mon. Let us withdraw, and seeme to minde them not. Men. Was men er'e blest with that excesse of joy Equall to ours; to us that feele no want Of high court favours lifes licentiousnesse; Kings have their cares, and in their highest state, Want those free pleasures crownes us fortunate. Val. O happy state. Mel. Glorious slave.— Aside. Val. Thrice happy, I'de not change Earth for Ioves felicitie. Pro. Nor I, who wu'd, what inconsiderate he For such a Mistris as the Emp'resse Wu'd be so dull, as not make use of Art, Forcing the bodies joviall able might, To yeeld her expectation full delight. Mon. Libidnious Goate.— Aside. Val. I'de do't, though Phaeton like, The hot receipt should fire this Fabrick. Men. When I commemorate her excellence, How lavish lovely dalliance free proceedes From that raritie of perfection, O How I'me ravisht; ravisht in thought as well, As with the Act; which breeds no wonder though High Iove transhap't him to Amphitrio To taste the pleasure of Alcmenas bed; Needs must such prodigall sweets mad thoughts of Men; when power t'atract the Gods. Mel. Impious Letchers.— Aside. Mon. Silence, marke the event.— Aside. Val. I that know none more worthy then my selfe Of true regard and worth; would be resolv'd What's he, that beares the valliant minde of man Dares for his mightie soveraigne Mistris more Then Vrctius Valens. Pro. That dare I, I dare; Fond that thou art to question such a toy, Were thy power equall to thy daring pride, Proculus dares doe more. Men. Nor thou, nor he, Not Valens nor Proculus though you both, Both durst as much as he durst cuckold Iove Menester would transcend you. Val. That our bloods decide. All draw, exposed to a Triple sight round. Pro. A Spirit of valour. Men. Let it come. Enter Messallina and Saufellus above. Mess. What killing objects, this presents our eyes, Our Favorites turn'd fighters must not be, Descend Saufellus, know the cause, wee'l follow. Val. Stand all so firme, this Seale expresse my rage. Pro. Mine this, Men. This mine Wound each other. Enter Saufellus. Sauf. Hold, hold, y're wounded all; As you'l incurre our Emp'resse deepe displeasure Hold, and resolve why thus you have expos'd Your lives to danger. Enter Empresse. Mess. Whence proceeds this fray. Men. From that concernes the credits of best men Which of us three in our affections priz'd Your excellence most. Mess. And was that the cause? Wee doe embrace and pretiously account The vigour of your loves; so you no more So full of spight, let prosecute your hate. With the like hardy daring, twill not please. We should esteeme your jarres rediculous Issuing from brainelesse wit discern'd in others. And as 'tis common to our emminent Sex, Triumph instate, and glory in your falls; Yet th'operation of your loves so workes, That it scruze ours to judge the contrary. Dry up your wounds with care; then come to court Love shall entrance your soules; prepare for sport. Exit Messallina and Saufel. Val. Ile study Art in love for recompence. Pro. My love shall mount. Men. Mine yeeld profuse expence. Exeunt Favorites. Mon. Here was a storme of mischiefe soone blowne or'e, Mel. 'Twas to preserve them for a wicked life, But since these complices are gon that are Not worth least memory; behold this booke, Set my deare friend, and I will read to thee Of that high Majestie puissant Ens, From whom we have our being, life, and soule, Which should dull flintie inconsiderate man, When with black deeds 'ith mytie bog of sinne, Beast like he wallowes; considers right, Thinkes on his present state (whence came and must) Then on that terrible Thunderer that sees, His actions kick at heaven; he then no more Would dare t'offend his Maker, but with teares, Lament his soules polution, which doth give Matter, by which mens soules immortall live, But through an unfrequented heavinesse I am prevented. Mon. Repose a while I'le reade. Enter Empresse and Saufellus above. Emp. Make us celestiall happy with thy newes, Art thou sure 'tis he. Sauf. 'Tis, 'tis Montanus, Sure as I live, I tooke full view of him Before and after the fight; then with drawne Within yon grove of Oakes. Emp. My hearts on fire To clip him; fly swift as thought Saufellus Conduct him to our Paradice of joy, If he escape desire then confound us, We onely view'd him once, but then the time Crost our desires; blest opportunitie That makes our happinesse a very heav'n Wee'l build an Altar, and erect a shrine That shall eternize thee for this; wer't my brother Resembled him we so intirely love, Wee'd force him ravish pleasure if not kill Be a Suniramis to sate our will. Enter Saufellus. Sauf. Haile to Montanus. Mon. Sir the like to you. Sauf. 'Tis th'Emp'resse pleasure you attend her will. Mon. Know you the cause. Sauf. Delay not with demands th'are frivilous Will you along. Mon. Your favour sir a while; I'le but awake my friend, (So-ho) sleepy still, Pray heaven this heavinesse imports no harme. Exeunt. Mel. How's this, my friend departed, I alone, I know not what to thinke, 'tis very strange, He thus unwak'd would leave me; sure he striv'd, Yet I so fast, that he no doubt was loath To breake my rest; 'tis so, and some chiefe cause Which I might well dispence with drew him hence. I'le to his fathers house, there certaine finde Or heare of him. Exit. Hoboyes. A Banquet, to it Montanus is usher'd in state by Saufellus and others, who placing him depart; Hoboyes cease, and solemne Musicke playes during his speech. Mon. O Potent lust, thou that hast power to make The valiant and the wise, coward, and foole, I'me not so dull, but that I know thee now. Now comprehend why Musicke breathes delight, And why this banquet; why both presents themselves To be my slaves; 'Tis to make me a slave To lust; that deadly potion of the soule, Ne Trauli quidem Montano equitis Romani, defensio recepta est, u modesta juventa, sed corpore insigni, accitus ultro noctemq; intræ unam a Messallina proturbatus erat, paribus lasciviis ad cupidinem &amp; fastidio. Tacit.Whose poyson quaft, kills body and the soule. That's the maine end of these harmonious straines, These stirring meates, which unto me appeare, Like those blew flames the damned taste in hell. Enter Emperesse by degrees, gazing at him. Celestiall Angels guard me, now she comes, And I so ill prepar'd, I, know not what, A suddaine earthquake trembles natures frame, Which like a falling Pine tree to and fro, Vncertaine where to fall, it tottering stands. She's most bewitching sweet, I feare, I feare, She will ore come; now I begin to burne, To scortch, like to the coales of Etna; strike Me eternall winter with thy frosts; quench Quench this hot combustion in my blood, And if I needs must fall, O sacred powers Benumbe my senses so, that I may taste No sweetnesse in the Act, yeeld no delight. Emp. Thus long with admiration we have stood To gaze on thy perfections, pretious shape Why dost thou shake? why stare? as rapt in wonder Why dumbe? or think'st thy happinesse a dreame This kisse confirme thee ours; entrance thy soule To stirre loves-panting appetite while thus We clip thee in our Armes, embrace thee thus. Mon. O— Emp. That's loves Alarum, to bed, to bed, To Venus field, there combate for loves treasure Swimme in excesse of joy, there ravish pleasure. Exeunt. Enter Mela. To thee faire fortune in divinest sense, In whom all excellence inclusive is, To that high power, I invocate impore. If pleas'd, direct where I may finde my friend, Ful when, I fitly may assimulate The restlesse acquiessence of my minde, To the perpetuall motion of a wheele. That by the force of water restlesse turnes The vigour of the torrent left unstopt. So the strang absence of my noble friend, Suffers th'insulting tortent of sad griefe, (Tyranicke-like upon the wheele of sense) To racke my restlesse rest, which I must beare, 'Tis vaine to strive 'gainst sorrowes streame to swim, Man hath no power on griefe, griefe power on him; What's he declines his visage to the ground, Is't not my friend? tis he, happily met. Enter Montanus dejected in countenance. Mon. Hell-cat no more, no more of thy imbrace, Findest thou my body enemy to lust And yet agen attempts me. Mel. How's this? Mon. Keepe off insatiate Empresse, I'le no more, Poyson of Monsters, the blood of Nessas Damme up thy Curtian-gulph-like appetite; May furies fright thy whorish fortitude Dancing Lavolto's in the very act And dambe you. Mel. Save him divine assistance; For he's lost; mistake not I'me thy friend Mon. Tis so, and I am happily mistooke Thy pardon worthy friend, it was my feare Of further ill; made me forget my selfe Distracted sense, as well it might, O ther's A strange deede past. Mel. I fully comprehend, By that distemper lately in your blood. 'Twas musicks sweetest concord to my soule, To heare with what a cold performance Th'act was wrested from you, happy prevention How like a doubtfull battle it hath made The victory more joyfull; which had else, Had you replenisht those soule-killing sweets, No meanes for safetie then, but fall you must, A prey to slaughter, or a slave to lust. But since with heavens prevention you are free, Fly Rome; the impious maladies she breeds, Experience tells, are hookes to catch at soules. Therefore to be avoyded, ther's no trust To trust to stay, where such infection raignes. VVho is at all times one; in that right way Man ought to be, being circumvolv'd mong those, That by the Plummets of licentious will Measure their vertues; 'tis impossible. The scholler, He, in whom there doth consist Honest conditions, and within whose heart Ther's many vertues make their residence, Though with night watchings at his study site, Wasting his vitall spirits (not unlike His burning Tapor) to illuminate Others the way that leads to the direct, From superficiall to essentiall joy, Even he ill company corrupts, directs To the indirect; so that some one vice Robs him of all his vertue: The Souldier That magnanimious resolution, He that leaves nothing unattempted May tend to the honour of his countrey, Ill company poysons with selfe conceit, Cankers with envie; till on the racke of Haute ambition stretcht, like stubble set On fire he prove a flame. And therefore to prevent us, gainst all ill 'gainst Wisedome commands our absence, truly knowes, Man at the best, his power to doe is little His state obnoxious, at the best most brittle. Mon. Your counsell points my actions their true way To immortalitie, forewarnes to flye, The dire event of future Tragedy Which as the flame, the fire of force must follow By th'Emp'resse bloudy project; that Monster In nature, in this the Emperours absence, Mounts on the highest Spyre of infamy, Resolves to joyne in Hymeneall bands With Cajus which Silius quaint vallanie, To put in speedy practise, he last night Ariv'd at Court. Mel. There let their impudence, For glassie glories of Monorcall state Ingender sinne with sinne, flatter their hopes, While our soules fixt on contemplation Make for the Ile of Corce, (come my deare Friend there on the Tyrhen shore wee'l practise Mans sole perfection to be heavenly wise.

By whose perswasions we are confident The sayd Nuptialls, to be but colourably, Onely of purpose t'avert the danger Of certaine prodigies, aym'd at our losse Of life and Empire. Calp.

Else, how should the meanes to his high ayme, Free from the plots of blood thus fairely greet Without least flaw in safetie. Pro. True, true, nor Can it enter in my thoughts to thinke, What obstacle should barre his excellence From writing Emp'rour. Men.

Sauf. Their love to you and feare of prodigies Pretended for to dimme dull Cæsars glory Will worke constraint. Val. Refresh to memory The Acts of blood that raign'd in Scylla's dayes. Emp. Busie their braines, and put them still in minde That the blacke thoughts of Cataline survive For this prodigious Age to perpetrate. Calp. Besides the Auspices, 'mong whom this grant Was sign'd, they by the Entrailes of their beasts Firmely affirme (past contradiction) Your raigne to be most safe and popular. Vir.

Silius growes popular, and the people As 'tis their nature, ever covet change, They are as easie to be fil'd with errours, As for a lust-stung strumpet to take up To her dishonor; therefore as Saylers, That have for guide the South and North, sometimes To traverse and to crosse their way, and yet Not lose their guide; so in the deepe affaires Of such high consequence of state (as now The time concerties) we must for guide, detaine Agitavero; num Messallina secretis minis depellerent amore Silij, cuncta alia dissimulantes deinde metu, ne ad pernicis ultto traherentur desistunt.

Thereby indeede man rarely Rests deceived, which for to put in speedy Practise, and stop the marriage, you and I My Lord (under the vaile of friendship) will To Rome; perswade the Empr'esse Cæsar is Himselfe; perceives that all her plots to his Destruction tends; the losse of Empire and Th'abuse of 'his bed, disswaded her from the Love of Silius, which (in the refusall) Blood and fire must quench.

There is no trust to such uncertaintie, T'were deadly Stibium to our vitall blood, Like that dire poyson thats resistative 'Gainst the most wholesome Antidotes of life. Weake mindes of men they are fit to be fool'd, Slighted, add scorn'd, whose dull ignorance Knowes not that women in their height of ill, Who barres them their delight, delight to kill.

Now, Does he claw like a decay'd Tradesman, when To maintaine the wagging of his chappes His wives Veneriall Firk-in must to Sale. Men. Why? did you ne're heare of a fellow, that By the scratching of his nimble pate, Workt your best pleasing project for a maske, Was well rewarded for't, when such as you For paines in song and dances laught to scorne Poore simple sots, their payment was the horne.

My Sun is set in blood, fly soule and catch “At a more glorious being, farewell breath, “Man's never in the way to joy till death. Dies. Sil. Why like a worme crawling twixt life &amp; death Am I thus forc'd; I must, I will not die So like a beast, the lofty Cedar and the aged Oake, Cuft with incessant stormes shall represent The fall of Silius; what? wil't not do? no? Shall my death then prevaile above my minde, O sad condition, misery of life. Expence of bloud faints me, and yet I stand, Stagger in spight of death; lifes threads uncut, What meanes this Riddle? are the Fates asleepe? So drunke at sight of this sad spectacle, I must awake their waking; I'me abus'd, Where art thou, thou invisible threefe; leane Rogue I dare thee to this combite, why slave, Dog, coward, dastard Death, no no; why then O kind best loving death; if valiant, if Thou be that sole conquerour of Kings time Speakes thee for? prethee, but for one bout, I'le not resist, scarse able to stand; open Breasted, take all advantage, disjoynt the Chaine of inauspicious stars, fettering My over wearied flesh with life, one thrust Put home will end me.

The good good Gods to pardon thee my love. Sil. Like a spent Taper onely for a flash, I doe recover to embrace thee sweet: Forgive me injur'd excellence; constant wife. Take from my lippes (deare heart) a parting kisse Cold as the dead mans Skull; nay weepe not sweet There is divinity in that weeping eye, Prayer on thy lip, and holinesse in thy heart. The Divells cannot say I flatter thee, Nor this abusive, scornefull, dull darke Age, Taxe me to say it never, never can, Not out of all the Catalogue of women, Pick such a Phænix Saint forth as thy selfe. In thee, bright heavens majesticke emminence, Lives my supporting prop against all ill To take me up to mercy. Dies. Syl. Stay, O stay, And take me with thee up to mercies seate, For when we are there I know, we shall not Part thus; O he is gone; the strings of life Are crackt; I'le not outlive thee, no; thy losse Most noble husband, wafts my soule the way To her eternall rest, breake heart, swell griefe, And mount me to my love; I neede not I, The burning coales of Portia, Lucrece knife, One kisse wilt do't, thus ends Syllana's life. Dies. Enter Pallas, with Virgilianus, Calphurnianus and Sulpitius Prisoners. Pall. Live royall Emp'rour long and happy live, To adde to your revenge behold I bring The approbrious Faction unto Silius. Emp. More blood unto this banquet welcome, what Virgillianus so grave a Senator So trech'rous, serv'd you as Bawdes to sooth the Mindes of Letchers, Calphurnianus and Sulpitius too: off with their heads, away With them, be suddaine, the tunne of vengeance Now begins to stoope broacht with the blood of These; vaine inconsiderate fooles. Nar. My Lord, The Core of lust still lives, time was Rome bragg'd Of these dead corpes for the most vertuous youths It e're brought forth, till your leud Empresse Poyson'd their bloods with her bewitching lust. Emp. Where is that wretch? Pal. Prisoner my Lord, safe in Lucullu's garden Emp. Remove these bodies, her bloods the period To my full revenge. Enter Vibidia Vib.

Exeunt omnes. Nar. I but such warning as she shall nere come there. Manet Narcissus. I'le give no trust to those her whorish eyes. Ac in cædem ejus Narcissus properavissat; verterat pernicio in accusatorem. Tacit.She will bewitch thee Cæsar, mollifie Thy flint heart; if they e're peece agen Off goes my head; I'le not abide the Test.

Exit. Enter Messallina, Lepida. Mess. Prevented with a storme in Sunshine, Frost in the heate of all our happinesse, O fire and Ice, O how betweene these two Sad smarting strange extreames I madly live Tortur'd in mind and blood. Lep.

Repent, redivell, Tell not me mother of repentance, Earths pleasures are to full of high content, To be forgot by such a bitter Pill. Pray give some better solace, what returne Makes Romes grave Matron your friend Vibidia, Can she with all her holinesse of life, Procure our pardon; is that possible. Lep. Onely a day of hearing that's all, which You must arme your selfe for 'gainst to morrow. Mess.
