      <field name="fulltext">A Curtaine being drawne, an Ale-house is discovered, out of which Time drives certaine ignorant, and yet Great undertaking Almanack-makers. Time. And must I still be vext! shall my gray age Be play'd upon, as if I were a Page To your fond Art, not Nature: did not live But by the stipend which you yearely give. Your owne's but fourty shillings, and that price Bindes you to order me by sage advice With Ticho Brach, and Ptolomy, so farre You dare out-doe a learn'd Albumazar. And with Predictions cheat the faith of men, That make your bookes their gods; and from your raigne Or drought foretold inhaunce the price of graine, This is the end of your high practise. 1. Alm. Wee Doe all by just rules of Astrologie. Time. Starre-gazing idiots, you Astrologers! That understand not what the name inferres. You have not enough Grammar to conceive The words true Etymon; and therefore leave Your vaine replies, lest I apply them to Another use. 2. Alm. What would Time have us doe? Time. Not fright credulitie with this yeares wonders; Eclipses; tempests; frosts; snowes; stormes and thunders. And you that sad fates sadly doe report In borrowed Latine from the Innes a court; Let not great Princes; Statesmen, and whole Nations Suffer this yeare by your Prognostications: As if you could the fates of all men teach, When your conjecture hath obtain'd the reach Of probabilitie: for which your eares May stand in time as fixt starres on the spheares Of some round pillory. 'Twill teach you how 'Tis judgement to be silent, though you know. 3. Alm. Why Astraregunt homines. Time. 'Tis true: Starres governe men; but Time shall governe you; And regulate your studies: or he'le be No longer ruler o're his Pentarchie. You shall not stuffe your annuall bookes with rimes Bought of the Ballad-mongers of the times; In which (and that shewes little Poetrie) He must enveigh 'gainst wine and venerie. Prescribe the fittest time for cutting cornes; And when the Pigges should feare the gelders hornes. These are your labours; and by such as these Each of you shewes himselfe Philomates, You likewise thinke 'tis grace your yeares workes are Fixt on the backside of some chalkie barre, Where's your owne score, perhaps for Ale or Beere You will not pay 'till the Platonick yeare. 4. Alm. Time Satyres me. Time. Indeed Time cannot lye: You know his Motto: ?????? ?? ????????. 'Tis well that you can make the country Squire For two pence yearely a Chronologer. Tell him how long 'tis since the world began; And since the Conquest every Monarches raigne. Then with this store enabled hee's complete; Can welcome friends with talke as well as meate, Before poore tenants have their rent to pay The Landlord's skilfull in the quarter day: Knowes every Termes returnes, and when he's ti'de By a Subpæna on his mare to ride To London; where he onely learnes to boast How much his journey, and his law-sutes cost. 2. Alm. Time knowes that we are schollers. Time. So you are; And learn'd ones too: whose speculations dare Reach at sublime things, when you cannot spye What snakes of folly at your owne feet lye. 3. Alm. What would Time have us then? Time. I'de have you be Not vaine prescribers of mens destinie; But Registers of actions, such as may Challenge deserv'dly a peculiar day To every owner. You me thinkes should show The executions done by th'English bow, When black Prince Edward bravely did advance His Ensignes through the very heart of France. I will have all the world observe this day, So glorious by the birth of him, that may Fill volumes with his acts, and challenge more Then all the great Heroes went before. 4. Alm. Such things as those Historians ought to day. Time. Be nothing, or be you Historians too. Practise a reformation, or (fond Elves) Chang'd into Satyres you shall lash your selves. Exit. 1. Alm. Is the gray dotard gone? Wee are then alone: Good fellowes every one Let's call my hostesse Joane. 2. Alm. Well said rithmer; thy halting verses will hardly support the fat cripple any longer that begs with them. Would wee had some Ale. 3. Alm. Hang this Time that would alter our profession, which is of equall antiquitie with him. Suppose wee have abilities; must we use them as he please? No: let us inspire our selves with Ale, and compile an everlasting Ephimerides. 1. Alm. Where's the stock-boy? Doe not mock boy: Lest I knock boy Your learn'd block boy. 3. Alm. Hast thou none left of thy sixe yeares before hand? If the Stationers refuse to trust, our bookes shall never more credit the Company with rubricks in the title. 2. Alm. Wee'le try all the houses in the Zodiac; and if they will not trust, wee'le pull downe the signes. 3. Alm. Here is the signe of the Moone, the rendevous of our fraternitie. If the worst comes to the worst, wee'le pawne Time for the reckoning. 4. Alm. By your favour we may more easily spend him. Hostesse enters. 3. Alm. Here comes shee will fill us the comfortable liquor. 2. Alm. By the dozen? 3. Alm. By the score boy. Wilt not Hostesse? Host. No indeed sir. I'le hazard no more upon your next yeares Almanack. You say there's a man in the Moone drinkes Claret; keepe him company. The woman at the Moone will keepe her Ale for better customers. 3. Alm. Shall wee have no Ale then? Hostesse. Not a cockle-shell full without money before-hand. 3. Alm. Here's two groats; fetch every man his pot, and before we drinke a health wee'le curse thee. Host. The Foxe will fare the better. Exit. 3. Alm. Maist thou have alwayes pennilesse guests like us, 'till thou pawne thy petticoate to pay the Brewer, and thy glorious shelves shine not so much as with an earthen platter. Instead of Shoelane hangings may the walls of thy house be painted with chalke; and the figures of no more valew then cyphars. Mayst thou weekly be subject to informers, and thy forfeited licence be put to the last use of wast paper. Host enters with drinke, and exit presently. Host. Stop your mouth sir. 3. Alm. Hast thou brought Ale? cry thee mercy. Here's a health to the Prince, whose Birth-day Time would have should be the whole subject of an Almanack. 4. Alm. Let him give the conceipt to a Poet; it may be worth a day to him. They drinke, and are transformed into Satyres, hornes growing out of their heads. 3. Alm. Time enters. Ha! hath Circes given us an inchanted cup; or are our wives turn'd City Witches? These are fine jestes. Time. 'Tis your owne idle humour makes you beasts. 2. Alm. Forgive us Time. Time. Nay dance a Horne-pipe now. That done perhaps I'le crop your well-growne brow. They dance: at the end whereof their hornes fall away. 3. Alm. Ha! wee are men againe. Time. Hence: since you sleight all counsaile, that is mine, I'le employ others in my great designe. Time drives them forth. A Symphonie of Musicke with chirping of Birds, singing of Nightingales and Cuckoes. The Scæne changing into a pleasant Garden, Time brings in May, attended by Flora and Vertumnus, who sing the following Song. The Song. On, gently on; the skye is faire: Arabian winds perfume the ayre, As they the Easterne gardens sweepe, Or Amber floating on the deepe. Such sweets doe here the sense bewitch. The Phenix pile is not so rich. Chorus. Here is a presence, from whose eyes An influence awes all destinies. A Sunne that can with one bright ray Make where it shines eternall May. Sing, sweetly sing. The chirping birds Have got new notes, and better words. What Nature wants Art doth supply, And makes it perfect harmony. Such sounds doe here enrich the eares, Above the Musick of the Spheares. Chorus. Here are presented to the tast Ripe fruits and early, that will last. For such we banish Nectar hence, Here's perfect May in every sence. Time. Welcome to Time thou comfort of the earth, That with thy warme dewe giv'st a lively birth To all her glories, which cold winter late Wrapt in his clowdes of ice: she desolate Vngarnisht then, wore nothing on her head But snow and barrennesse, nor was her bed Cover'd with greene: then heavens crystall eye Seldome peepe out of his bright canopie. But now thou hast unto the infant Spring Given perfection; and thy blessings bring The Summers hopes on. Thou Times Queene shalt be Whilst Flora and Vertumnus waite on thee. Thou own'st a glory yet transcends the best Of these, as day light doth the the time of rest. This day, that makes Time young, in hope to see A thousand revolutions e're he be Dissolv'd, to gaze on Trophies shall adorne The Princes life, and acts was this day borne. Goe my delight exhaust the treasurie Of all thy pleasures; to his gracious eye Present the choycest. May. I have none that are Worthy his high acceptance: they are farre Inferiour to the things that should set forth The fulnesse of his glory and his worth. The pastimes which belong to me are rude, Fitter for course ones, and the multitude: Yet (so the error may be pardon'd) they Shall enter to delight him as they may. A Morisk Dance. Time. Hee's pleas'd with this. Greatnesse and goodnesse ayme At such proportion in his Princely frame, That every part of his, his heart, his eye, Expresse them in a due equallitye. I have another to present him, then Wee'le yeeld to change. May. I'le never change whilst men Keepe registers of Time. And though it be Custome, that they doe chiefly welcome me At my first entrance, this shall be my day As th'onely one that crownes the pride of May. I'le weare no other flowres upon my head But the Deluce; with Roses, white and red; And the stout Thistle: each of which implies An Embleme full of sacred Mysteries. The Lillie and the Rose are beauties flowres: They deck; the Thistle shall defend his bowers. The white and red Rose thornelesse, signifie A gentle rule: The Lillie, soveraigntie. The Thistle strength and power to quell his foes That rudely dare attempt to gather those. Besides, these severall flowers doe appertaine To Nations subject to his future raigne. And this is all poore May can straine her powers To doe; to make her Garland of his flowers. And cause men yearely on this day to see His name preserv'd unto posteritie. Time hath some rich thing to present. Time. I have (As Time is powerful) summond from the grave Eight Princes all of Wales, whose histories Shall be instruction, and their memories Present Heroick actions so t'his mind, That though their fortunes were not alwayes kind, Their vertues he shall strictly imitate, And make those vertues awfull over Fate. Vertumnus you, and Flora you be gone. And if their ayrie formes are quite put on Let them appeare; whilst lovely May and I Listen to th'Birds and Natures harmonie. Another Symphonie with like chirping, whilst the Scene is varied into a glorious expression of Elizium: in which appeare the eight Markers, representing eight Princes of Wales, distinguisht by the severall impresses, and inscriptions on their Shields. Who whilst the following song is singing, approach the Presence, salute the Prince, then place themselves in a figure for the Dance. The Song. From th'Earth where honour long hath slept, And noblest dust (as treasure kept) By hallowing clay hath made it shine More glorious then an Indian mine, These brave Heroick shadowes come To sport in this Elizium. Chorus. For theirs and this doe both agree In all but the Eternitie. From th'ayre, or from the Spheares above As they in perfect concord move. Let Musick sound, and such as may Equall his harpe that rules the day. Thus doe we welcome you to night Vnto our Mansion of delight. Chorus. For yours and this doe both agree In al but the Eternitie. The Dance ended they retire, whilst Time speakes the Epilogue. Time. Old Time leaves all his blessings that he may Here with this presence; and will every day Confirme possession. Sadly sets the Sunne After his dayes course cheerefully was runne. The Moone lookes pale; the Tapers dimnly burne: The feare of your departure makes them mourne. Sweet rest attend ye all: Good night 'tis late, Many birth-dayes may you thus celebrate. Time being received into the Scæne it closeth. The End.</field>
