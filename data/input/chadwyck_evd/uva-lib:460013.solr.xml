      <field name="fulltext">ELVIRA: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE Earl of BUTE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. War is no more: those thunders cease to rowl, That lately shook the globe from pole to pole; When Britain sought and triumph'd o'er her foe, Wherever winds can waft or waters flow. She, and she only could, bade discord cease, And, having humbled, gave the nations peace. May its wish'd influence, thro' this favor'd Isle, On every brow, in every bosom, smile! 'Twas union made her Queen of land and main: 'Tis that alone her triumphs can maintain; Improve those blessings, arts will now adorn, And send them safe to Britons yet unborn. O might no other strife your hearts divide, Than how a culprit-author should be try'd; Ours, whom no mean, no partial interest moves, Would be the victim of that peace he loves. Yet, why this fear? Good nature is your boast: And, who most want it, ever feel it most. Abroad, you knew to conquer and to spare: And, as your cause, your conduct too was fair. Then, what you gave so nobly to the foe, At home, and to a friend, you sure will show. His scenes, to night, no feign'd adventure bring: If tears shall flow, from real ills they spring. What Lisbon trembling saw and truly mourn'd; What her first Muse in epic strains adorn'd; What Paris next bedew'd with copious tears, Now, to the Sons of Britain, late appears. To you, wherever Truth and nature reign, And Terror shakes, and Pity melts the strain; Wherever these declare the genuine bard, Your warm applauses are his sure reward: Then, while such Judges strike our author's view, His fears are from himself, and not from you.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. RODRIGO, ALVAREZ. ALVAREZ. Health to your highness! RODRIGO. Brave Alvarez, welcome. This long-expected, this auspicious morn Will see confirm'd the league of amity Betwixt Castile and Portugal. You time Your wish'd arrival well; to be at once The witness and partaker of our joy. ALVAREZ. My absence, and th'unceasing cares of war On Afric's plains, against her swarthy sons, Where, till Don Pedro, our brave prince, return'd, The chief command was mine; that tedious absence Has left me ignorant, or ill-inform'd, Of most particulars. RODRIGO. Then know, my Lord, Our present queen, the mother of Almeyda, Brought with her from Castile that blooming princess, The wish of all beholders! And, no doubt, You must have often heard her lover's voice Most lavish in the praises of the fair one, Whom he this day espouses, and in her Whate'er is excellent or lovely. ALVAREZ. Never! Don Pedro, with that chaste reserve and caution Which would become the coldest virgin's fear, Even on a theme so pleasing still was silent; Or only, when alone, indulg'd his rapture. RODRIGO. So cold a lover, and so warm a hero, Are contraries that seldom blend in youth. 'Tis most suprizing! for, as we have heard, His heat of valor is a rapid flame, Encreasing as it spreadsâ ALVAREZ. And yet his prudence, Serenely cool, keeps measure with his fire. Had you, in this last battle with the Moors, Had you beheld the mutual poize of each, As either was call'd forth by fair occasion, Your praises would be transport!âbut proceed. RODRIGO. The sum of all is this. To-day he weds The bright Castilian princess; and this hour Her brother Ferdinand's ambassador Has audience of our Kingâ [Trumpet sounds. ALVAREZ. That trumpet speaks The happy moment come. May peace, my lord, A long, a glorious peace be the fair issue! SCENE II. Trumpets sound again. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA, RODRIGO, ALVAREZ, Courtiers. ALONZO. The heavens, my Queen, look smilingly upon us, As pleas'd to see, thus solemnly secur'd, The league that joins your Ferdinand to me In one true bond of loveâWhere is my son? Not follow us? RODRIGO. His modest fear avoids To be the hearer of his own just praise. ALONZO. Such fear, attendant on successful arms, Becomes the brave, and most of all in youth: 'Tis then the nobler conquest. Gentle cousin, The ties of blood have made his glory yours: I know they have, Rodrigo. You, Alvarez, Were partner of his day; you nobly fought And conquer'd with him. Both of you must share The joy sincere that swells a father's bosom, Made young again and blooming in a son. SCENE III. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA, RODRIGO, ALVAREZ, Courtier, &amp;c. COURTIER. The ambassador of Spain, my lordâ ALONZO. 'Tis well. Conduct him hither. SCENE IV. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA, RODRIGO, ALVAREZ. [The King ascends his throne, placing the Queen on his left, the Ambassador and his train range themselves.] AMBASSADOR. Sir, my royal master, Don Ferdinand, by his ambassador Thus speaks the true fraternal part he takes In your full joy. He holds himself most happy, That his lov'd parent shares a throne with you; And that his sister, his Almeyda, weds So great a monarch's heir, and who renews The virtues of his race. Don Pedro's fame Spreads not o'er Portugal more welcome beams Than o'er our friendly Spain. And you enjoy The bliss supreme, that noblest minds taste deepest, A son that loves the sire he emulates! Yes, you have seen him, from his earliest youth, Pursue the path your valour trod before To conquest and renown. Your arm, by him, Has oft been felt in Afric; oft has shook Her strongest forts, her deepest squadrons pierc'd; And now, even now, of laurels fairly won A mighty harvest reap'd. Your interests, Sir, Are link'd with ours by bonds of mutual friendship: And where allies are mutual in their love, The happiness is common. Our Castile, Itself triumphant, triumphs too with you! ALONZO. Your sovereign is the partner of my heart. His mother, now my queen, and who adorns The seat she fills, has made our nations one: And that same treaty, which declar'd her mine, Assures Don Pedro to her daughter's arms; Assures my kingdom's safety: for these nuptials, Tho by the guilt of intervening war Too long delay'd, shall be accomplish'd now; While, to the holy temple, Peace and Leisure, His best attendants, wait in Hymen's train. Go, bear this message to my brother back; That all Castile may share the joy it gives. SCENE V. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA. ALONZO. Yes, madam, your lov'd daughter soon shall see This happy union fix her future fate. QUEEN. I could have wish'd the same propitious morn, That join'd our hands, had seen compleated too Their plighted vows. ALONZO. It was my fondest aim. But could a father's love to such a son Deny what his impatient courage urg'd? Some short delay, some respite, till his arm By deeds of noble daring should have earn'd The blessing he aspir'd to. QUEEN. Yet, my lordâ ALONZO. I plac'd myself the sword within his hand, And whetted his young spirit. Fortune oft Companions youth most willingly, and leads The nearest road to fame. I then foresaw, He would be all that I had been before. I thenceforth ceas'd to conquer, but by him: And, thanks to heaven! his actions have outgone A parent's warmest hope. QUEEN. To this my heart Gives unrestrain'd assent. ALONZO. The Moors, you see, Reduc'd to sue for mercy. Part, in chains, His conquering arm confess, and grace his triumph: The rest, subdu'd by his victorious name, Lie trembling in the depth of distant desarts. To him what glory! what true joy to me! I now dare hope, he may deserve to wed The beauty he desires. QUEEN. Forgive me, Sirâ Have you no doubt, no foresight of resistance, Nay of refusal, on the prince's part? For me, in spite of all my partial hopes, I dread some bar, some obstacle unknown Betwixt us and our wishes. ALONZO. Whence can rise Suspicions so unlikely? QUEEN. I have mark'd, With all a mother's watchfulness of fear, His strange demeanor. Gloomy, lost in thought, He sees his bride, as if he saw her not. No beam of kindness brightens in his eye; No word of tenderness melts from his lip; As if nor bloom, nor grace, nor gentle spirit Grew with her opening years. ALONZO. Th'alarm is vain. Grant some indulgence to the pride of youth, An early hero's ardor, with the blaze Of his first conquest dazzled and engag'd. A softer passion, doubt it not, will soon Dispel that gaudy dream, and leave his breast All-open to the better bliss that waits him. QUEEN. And yet, my busy fears still whisper to me, Why was he absent this distinguish'd day? Why, with his presence, deign'd he not to grace My Ferdinand, your brother and ally, Here in the person of his minister? Should he resist, my Lord? ALONZO. Resist? Just heaven! I shudder at the thought. In such resistance The rebel would at once efface the son. Ha! should he push his pride to that extreme, More guilty as the more with glory bright, He then should find, that conquest and renown, That even the bonds of nature, cannot free A subject from the laws; that all are light As the blown bubble, weigh'd with a king's honor QUEEN. Sir, I would yet adviseâ ALONZO. No: a first subject, From whose example each descending rank Should learn obedience, is himself most bound. In him resistance would be deepest treason. It cannot be, my queen: turn we our thoughts From such forebodings of imagin'd guilt. I will, this coming moment, to the princess Disclose what I have fix'd. That done, the prince Shall know my last resolve. QUEEN. Ah! in what words? How will a father speak it? ALONZO. As his king! SCENE VI. The QUEEN, ELVIRA. QUEEN. ElviraâYou have heard your queen's complaints; Have heard too what Alonzo, fix'd as fate And resolutely just, has now determin'd. The fatal secret that alarms us both, I think, is in your keeping. ELVIRA. Heaven! in mine? QUEEN. In yours. Whene'er the prince vouchsafes a visit To my poor court, his eyes are ever turn'd, Are ever fix'd on youâWhat should that mean? ELVIRA. Your words amaze me!â QUEEN. Are Almeyda's charms, Whatever Nature's kindest hand can lavish On favor'd youth, to justify at full A mother's fondnessâtell me, are those charms Hid but from him? while all beholders else Divide, with mine, the transports they confess. They see in her combin'd each brighter grace Of look and air, see virtue's fairest stamp Upon her brow imprest, and over all And all exalting, modest ignorance Of her own worth: And have I yet to fear, For such a daughter, coldness or disdain? ELVIRA. How can you deem the prince so stern of nature, That beauty has no power upon his heart? No, Madam, he has felt it, and admires Its awful influence in Almeyda's eyes! QUEEN. You know it then? ELVIRA. It is not mine to read The secret of his bosom; but he oft, With me confessing her superior charms, And that true virtue, lovely as unfeign'd, The beam that lights those beauties into blaze, Has oft proclaim'd her all your fondness thinks. QUEEN. And sought out you, and only you, to pour His amorous rapture in your willing ear? Indeed!âElviraâtremble! You but pull Destruction on your headâyes, sure destruction, By daring to deceive me! No: not her, When you are by, his theme is not Almeyda. Of you he talks! ELVIRA. Of me! QUEEN. Of you alone! You either dare to loveâor, calm my fears, And point me to the bosom I should pierce! For hereâI here disclose my inmost soulâ She, the rash fair one, who should lift her eyes To that forbidden height; should wound my breast, A parent's breast, in its most tender sense, She, the devoted victim of my rage, The wretch, the vain presumer, then should feel How far a mother and a queen can punish! ELVIRA. Ye saints and angels!âMadam, let calm reasonâ QUEEN. My daughter is to me health, pleasure, fame! My sum of good or ill is wrapt in her! Mine her affront, her rival too is mine! And to revenge her, earth and heaven in vain Would bar my way. I am on fire to know Where I should strike. Thenâmark meâfind her out, This guilty headâor ruin hangs o'er thine! SCENE VII. ELVIRA. What have I heard! If my stun'd ear may credit Her direful threats, the tempest is at hand That must o'erwhelm us both! And yet how firm, Amid these horrors, would my heart be found, If only I stood obvious to the bolt! If all my fears were for myself alone! SCENE VIII. ELVIRA, DON PEDRO, RAMIREZ. DON PEDRO. Elvira! my soul's happinessâ ELVIRA. Ah! Prince! I have to tellâO heaven!âBut look that none, No eye may here surprize us. DON PEDRO. You, Ramirez, Will watch without. Now, in the name of love, What mean these streaming eyes? this face o'ercast With dark despair? Speak, save me from my fears. Suspence is torture! ELVIRA. And discovery, death! My Lord! my husband! now the hour is come, The fatal moment my sad thought presag'd! Even at the sacred altar, when our hearts Were wedded with our hands, even then I fear'd itâ O were the threaten'd ruin all my own! DON PEDRO. Our fate is one; our happiness or woe Inseparably link'dâBut whence, my love, This deep alarm? ELVIRA. Your marriage with the Princessâ O thence it springs! Alonzo too has nam'd Th'approaching hour to tell you, it is fix'd! Yet more, th'offended Queen suspects our loves! Had you beheld the rage to which her soul Abandons all its faculties!âAnd now, Made furious by despair, to what a height Will jealousy transport her, when its eye, In this suspected mistress, finds a wife! DON PEDRO. Yet, calm thy fears. Since on Don Pedro's faith Depends the sacred charge of saving thee, His sum of bliss! what anger, whose revenge Should wake such tempest in Elvira's bosom? ELVIRA. Prince, judge more nobly of me. This alarm Is all for him, whose every pain is mine. My dangers touch me, but as your distress; As they must woundâfor Oh too sure they will! Thy generous breast. And it will witness for me, The splendor of a crown, that worship'd sun Of vulgar eyes, could never dazzle mine: For when I dar'd, in giving you my hand, To violate the law, the rigid law, That makes a marriage, such as mine, rebellion; I came the willing victim of your love, Resign'd, devoted to whatever fate Heaven may reserve for either! DON PEDRO. Yes, Elvira, Thy generous virtue was the charm supreme That made me first, and binds me thine, for ever! ELVIRA. Nor do I now repent me. No, my Lord: Even on the scaffold, at the lifted ax My heart could smile; remembring it had once, By being yours, brought happiness to both. DON PEDRO. The same bright flame, which angels might avow, Inspires thy lover's breastâfor such I am, Such will to death be found. The name of wife, While it refines this passion, makes it duty: And if I needs must tremble for thy days, All other names, however holy deem'd, Son, subject, father, king, are light as air, When in the ballance laid to counterpoise Those, still more sacred, that connubial love Has rais'd, has sanctify'dâ ELVIRA. My soul shrinks back With horror from these transports. O remember, When Hymen's secret rite first join'd our hands, Remember what my tenderness exacted, And what your vows assur'd meâstill to hold Elvira dear; but still, as death, to shun The crime of civil war! and O what doom, What fate soever heaven may have in store For her you honor'd, never to forget, Your father is your sovereign! DON PEDRO. By the Power, Whose primal law has made our being one! No promises shall stay a husband's arm From sheltering thee. There is on earth no claim, No tie of duty strong enough to hold My fierce impatience. Thou to me art all, Faith, virtue, honor: or these shadowy names All vanish at the brightness of thine eye! ELVIRA. My Lord, I must not hear youâ DON PEDRO. Thenâretire: Fly, if it must be, this tumultuous court, This scene of storm and danger. To the shade, To that sweet solitude where first our loves Were ratify'd and blest, where calm Content And true Repose have fix'd their soft abode, Return, Elvira: safety there awaits thee. ELVIRA. O dear remember'd scene! O hours of peace That are no more! Beneath its pensive pines, And by the murmurs of its mazy stream That breath'd out freshness on our secret walk, The morn arose, the peaceful evening clos'd On our united hearts! All fear was far, All jealousy of courts; for Love himself Stood guardian of the shade! DON PEDRO. No more, no more: These thoughts but soothe, but soften both to weakness. For me, no color of delay remains. I know Alonzo well; his eye severe, His breast inflexible: and I this hour Must meet their utmost terror. Then the Queenâ Should her unsleeping jealousy at last Surprize the dangerous secret of our loves, The King, most sure, to her insulted pride, And to the voice of Justice, would give up Elvira's headâO fly, and guard my soul From this distracting fear! ELVIRA. It must not be. For me to fly at present would be fatal: At once disclosing what with all our care We should conceal. 'Tis safer to remain; To guide our steps with prudence, and our breasts With firmness arm. From this alarming hour, We meet no moreâand is it I, O heaven! Who give the hard advice?âno more exchange A look, a smile, where other eyes are present; For all around are hostile! DON PEDRO. Be it so. I go resolv'dâBut, O my soul's best treasure! O'er every motion, every look and word, Let close-ey'd Caution watch. ELVIRA. Alas, my Lord! All that a woman's feeble reason can, Elvira will attempt. Ye pitying powers, Who see with what reluctance from his sight I turn my parting steps, around his head Spread your protecting wings! for oh! who knows What can assure us, but we both receive, And both an everlasting farewel give! End of the first ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. ALONZO, ALMEYDA. ALONZO. No more, Almeyda. ALMEYDA. Then, I hop'd in vain To touch a King, in whom my heart reveres A second father? Yet, a while delay This promis'd union of your son and me, Till he himself with fond impatience chides The tardy hours, and presses to be mine. It most becomes us both. ALONZO. It suits at least The conscious pride that dignifies your sex. More nicely fram'd, more delicately coy, Than grosser man, such chaste reserve, that spreads New brightness o'er your charms, exalts them too. Complaint, on such a theme, would ill beseem A virgin's mouth. I know it: and the less You urge my promise, a King's honor given Exacts, with stricter care, its full performance. My orders are already sent. ALMEYDA. O Sir, If my true cares, by all a daughter's duty, To merit your esteem, can have inspir'd Alonzo's least regard; and if amidst A kingdom's high concerns, you deign a thought On what may stain Almeyda's life with shame, Or make it bright and happy! yet recall Those orders: yet suspendâ ALONZO. Your words amaze me! I, in my turn, am left in equal doubt; Nor know I what this strange reluctance means. My son! Don Pedro!âis he to your thoughts An object of such horror? Why this dread Of calling me your father? Must I think Contempt of himâ ALMEYDA. Contempt? Alas, my Lord, Could he deserve it, did my reason judge him Less worthy of the blood from whence he springs; I thenâO Sir!âI then might wait his pleasure, With less emotion trembling at this heart. To you I dare disclose its inmost weakness, Tho shame arises blushing to forbid meâ Then knowâbecause I loveâI dread his answer! Yes, from the moment I beheld him first, A sudden softness, to myself unknown, Sprung in my bosom; charm'd at once and pain'd me With all the mingled war of love and doubt: And gave me soonâalas! too soon to know, Almeyda's future fate was in his power! Andâif I miss'd his heartâ ALONZO. Proceed, fair Princess. The blush that reddens there is Virtue's color: Her chaste hand spreads it. But proceed unmov'd: And be assur'd a parent's kindest ear Is open to your tale. ALMEYDA. I need not say How, with his rising fame, my passion grew. 'Twas glory fed it: and each added conquest, Like heaven's kind dew upon th'unfolding rose, Nurs'd the new blossom into strength and beauty. But, more unhappy as more fondly his, The cold that hangs on his constrain'd address Is winter here, and withers all my hopes! Hence grows, my Lord, the backwardness you blame: Permit it to my sex, till ripening time Shall warm his bosom into mutual softness. ALONZO. Daughter!âfor that dear name is justly due To such exalted openness of heart, True Honor's fair companionâtrust to me; Rely on all a father's love. I feel, Yes, feel already every soft emotion These tender names convey. Let not a dream, A distant doubt of ills impossible Alarm that gentle bosom. No, Almeyda! When you shall learn, as instantly you may, Not his obedience only, but his love, Your fears will fly before them. SCENE II. ALONZO, ALMEYDA. GUARD. Sir, the Prince Attends your pleasure. ALMEYDA. Ah! I must be gone: But if my tears have influenceâ ALONZO. Go, my daughter, And on my love repose your every care. SCENE III. ALONZO, DON PEDRO. ALONZO sits. My subjects, Prince, the triumphs of your sword Have oft beheld, oft hail'd with loud applause: Alonzo too has felt a parent's share Of joy in theirs. The time is come at last For other festivals, the gentler triumphs That wait on love and hymeneal rites. These are the honors that can best reward The warrior's glorious toils: and much it moves My wonder, Prince, that I, who ought to find In your impatience all a lover's ardor, Must here advise, nay must impose, obedience! DON PEDRO. Sir, from a father's kindness I had hop'd Commands less rigid, less severely urg'd: And that his love would in my silence read, What filial reverence stifles on my tongue. Ah, Sir! recall this harsh command. ALONZO. Recall it! By heaven! this rude demeanour, should I give The rein to my just wrath, might cost thee dearâ Nor think thy blindness to Almeyda's worth, This savageness of soul by love unsoften'd, Thy sole offence. DON PEDRO. Alas! what else can stir My sovereign's anger? ALONZO. A King's word is past! Alonzo's word and oath! the league too seal'd And ratify'd, on this express condition! DON PEDRO. And yet, Don Pedro's heartâ ALONZO. Ha! canst thou dream, The nuptials of a Prince, those general ties On which depend the peace and bliss of millions, Are bound with flowery bands, which Fancy twists With idle fingers? twists for those alone, Th'inferior herd, who live but for themselves? Far other maxims guide the royal choice, More noble, more exalted. Not enslav'd By vulgar forms, the common good decides A prince's fate: and, where his people's welfare Directs his judgment, there he gives his hand. DON PEDRO. Thenâin the dearest interest of our heart, Its truest bliss or its severest woe, The heart itself has no election left! This would be binding hard, nay rivetting, Those artificial chains, which Craft of state First forg'd, and Vanity still deigns to wear. Yet Nature has her claims, her elder rights, More holy, more inviolably binding. Are these extinguish'd only to the wretch, Who, nearest to a throne, is most a slave? The lowest slaveâ ALONZO. What mean'st thou? Whither tends This raving talk? DON PEDRO. Yes, here the cottage-hind, Burnt by the beam or shivering in the shade, Smote by the sore vicissitude thro life Of cold, heat, hunger, is a king to him. He, with his heart, can freely give his hand: Can chuseâAh, Sir, you tremble with your angerâ But, at your knees, behold a son with pity! O with a father's gracious ear receive What now he must unfold! ALONZO. Thou shalt be heard. That justice bids; by whose eternal rule All kings should reign. Arise. DON PEDRO. When first the Mother Of Ferdinand became your Queen, alas! You deign'd not, Sir, to read my heart, or know The springs that move it; but engag'd your faith, And promis'd me at once to his fair Sister. ALONZO. True: and that promise is inviolable. What would a king be, where the reverent awe That makes his person sacred, should mankind Not dare to rest their faith upon his honor? Ask thy own bosom. DON PEDRO. O! I well believe, The youth, the beauty of that charming maid Left you no doubt of their full influence On my touch'd heart: you could not then foresee The bar invincible it still opposesâ I speak it with regretâto this wish'd union. ALONZO , rising. Am I awake? DON PEDRO. I feel, severely feel, Fair as she is, she never can be mine. Tho Beauty form'd her in the truest mold, Tho Love has added to her flowering youth Each winning grace, each air of sweet attraction; By all unmov'd, how can I bear the thought Of wedding her my heart can never own? O! if my soul is precious in your sight, If virtuous deeds, inspir'd by your example, Have made me not unworthy to be call'd The son of him who most adorns a throne; To Nature's nobler law let those of state For once give place! and save a breaking heart, That cannot to itself be false or base, My sire and sovereign! save it from the crime Of disobedience! ALONZO. Thou hast said: and still A parent's fondness here is strongly pleading The cause of Mercy for thee. Yet, be warn'd; That parent is thy king! and all his love Will plead in vain against the voice of duty. The sanctity of thrones should be preserv'd, Like that of altars, pure; the faith of leagues, Inviolate, as Heaven's own law supreme. And wouldst thou, by the breach of ties like ours, Wouldst thou afford to Ferdinand pretence For kindling up, as then he fairly might, The flames of cruel and consuming war, And leave to us the deep, the long remorse Of shedding in a cause, unjust and base, The blood of thousands? DON PEDRO. Can Alonzo fear To light a fire of stubble, which his nod Extinguishes at once? Secure to conquer, Why shun to fight? The laurel in our reach, Why pause to make it ours? No: rather urge, Invite a foe, your power is sure to crush; And, from the wish'd occasion, add Castile To those late conquests that renown your arms. Let neighbouring nations feel, with dread and reverence, Th'ascendant of your genius: while your son, In such a shining path, shall count it glory With his last blood to seal a father's fame! ALONZO. Such talk may suit the foe of human kind, A hero's mouth, whose business is destruction: But I must act a nobler partâa King's! The father and preserver of his people! We war for them alone, to make them safer And happier by our triumphs. Other wars, Of mad ambition or of blind revenge, But shame the prince, and curse the land he rules. And may the Nimrods of each blood-stain'd age, Th'exterminating Demons of mankind, Reap horror for their portion! Are we rais'd Alone to conquer? Are mankind but made, That we, as lust or fury drives our will, Should traffic with their blood? We are the guardians Of free-born men, not lords of slavish herds. Upon their bliss is built our truest fame: And when we deviate from that glorious end, We are not kings, but robbers, but assassins. Keep these fair maxims ever in your eye; And when my death shall make this sceptre yours, Remember and fulfill them. Now, Don Pedro, My subject now, submission is thy part. Acquit my promise, make Almeyda thine; For thus, and in one word, thy king commands it. DON PEDRO. O hear me, and recall the stern commandâ Ah thenâin one word tooâfor what I am Permits no moreâI cannot. ALONZO. Ha! SCENE IV. ALONZO, DON PEDRO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA. ALONZO. This rebel Resists me to my face, and shews unveil'd That unsubmitting pride, which my fond love Durst not foresee. By this determin'd insult To your Castile, he covers me and you, And your Almeyda, with one common shame: And doubt I still to punish him?âBut, tell me, Say, is there not some partner of his guilt, Some dark accomplice, whose pernicious counsel Thus hardens him in guilt? QUEEN. You see her there, Th'accomplice you would find! ALONZO. Elvira! ELVIRA. Me! QUEEN. Drawn from his duty by her feeble charms, Aided, no doubt, with all th'ensnaring skill Of female arts, to this degenerate passion He poorly offers up Almeyda's worth, And feeds a subject's vanity by boasting, How rich a victim bleeds before her shrine! ALONZO. Amazement! Can it be? QUEEN. It is not now I first discover whence his coldness grows. Day after day have I beheld his eye Of love and softness ever hung on hers: Nay, when alone, when I the dreadful truth Try'd to explore, the starting tear, that stole Down her flush'd cheek, discover'd all I fear'd, Even nowâI scarce had reach'd my own apartmentâ They met in secret; and in secret long Conversing, parted, each with streaming eyes. And see, my Lord, read on their guilty cheeks Disorder and alarm! ELVIRA. I am accus'dâ But 'tis in vainâSuspicions are not proofsâ Th'imputed crimeâ DON PEDRO. Elvira, we are born Above dissimulation. YesâI love; And dare, without a blush, avow my passion; The object makes it gloryâBut, on me, On my devoted head fall your full vengeance: Elvira, Sir, is guiltless. Sheâ ALONZO. Be dumb! Ungrateful! cruel! ELVIRA. Hear Elvira speak. Make her, untry'd, unjudg'd, the sacrifice! If so fair peace betwixt you and the prince Might be restor'd, a death so justly due Would be my dearest wish! ALONZO. What? what remains? Let her own chamber henceforth be her prison, Till she her conduct justifies at full. Madam, with you I trust her: be it yours To keep her person safe. DON PEDRO. Good angels guard it! With whom, my gracious LordâAh! in what hands Do you entrust her tender frame? ALONZO. Peace! peace! Nor farther urge my furyâI suspend Thy fate some moments: this last day is given thee Yet to reflect; yet to efface thy crime By prompt obedience. Should it pass in vainâ Thou art no more my son! Away. DON PEDRO , aside. Too soon I may returnâmore guilty than I go! SCENE V. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ELVIRA. ALONZO. Thou seest, O heaven! the horrors of my lot; That I may soon, in this offending son, Be forc'd to punish whom I hold most dear. Oppose not now the Monarch to the Father! My heart would be the first: imperious duty, Alas! may drive me to assert the King. Then teach submission to his stubborn will, That he may yet repent, and I be blest! SCENE VI. The QUEEN, ELVIRA. QUEEN. You see, your eyes enjoy the cruel triumph Of our despair. But you are now my prisoner, [Guards enter. And, with your head, shall answer what befalls! For could your arts disarm Alonzo's wrath, You never shall entreat a Mother's heart, By jealous honor made inexorable. Nay more; should I resign the loosen'd rein To my full rage, one victim were too few! The cruel Prince, who dares to stain our name With this disgrace, may thenâThe blood forsakes Your cheek at his imagin'd dangerâKnow, And let it shake your inmost soul! the fear You shew for himâbut wings the fate of both! SCENE VII. ELVIRA. I rise above all horrors for myself Of torments or of death. Don Pedro's fate, Inhuman queen! his fate alone can wound Elvira's breast: her own she scorns to feel. Ills, that but touch ourselves, all disappear; For what we love, we only know to fear! End of the second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. ALONZO, the QUEEN. ALONZO. Yes, let her come. The justice of a King, That law supreme which ever ought to guide His public will, requires she should be heard. Her virtues too, and the fair services To former monarchs and to me perform'd By her forefathers, make it juster still. QUEEN. What would you more? Is not her guilt confess'd In that unworthy passion she inspires? Nor is the pride of her ambition bounded Barely to suffer it: I know, my Lord, That drawing glory from her conquest won, She spares no grace, no favor, to maintain it. ALONZO. Such oft is woman seen: to Vanity, To that mere idolâyet their greater god; For Love himself holds but the second placeâ Devoting even that honor they oppose To Nature's law! QUEEN. And will you leave her then To boast this triumph o'er a monarch's oath? Leave her at large to stretch her boundless sway, Up from your meanest subject to the throne; Where she will reign imperious in a heart By love enslav'd: perpaps decide the fate, The being of an infant, yet unborn, Who is to heir your throne! ALONZO. I hear, and weigh What you so justly urge: and my first thought Was, with her death, to have atton'd her crime. But no: that were on the wild sea of passion To drive at random, as th'unguided bark Is borne before the blastâShe shall be heardâ Yourself shall hear her; sound her secret aims, And search thro all the woman in her soul. You know my thoughts, and what I purpose for her: Set those in open light before her eyes, With firmnessâbut with temper. SCENE II. QUEEN. Wise men tell us That deep dissembling is th'imperial art By which kings reign; and that its mystic veil Must still be drawn betwixt them and the eyes Of their presuming subjects. Must I stoop To this felt baseness? Is a sovereign's will By those to be controll'd whom heaven ordains The vassals of his nod; to crouch and kiss The foot that spurns them? Well; this art for once, Descending from myself, I will essayâ Guard, call your prisoner hitherâand assume, If yet I canâfor just disdain forbids itâ This gentleness of look that is prescrib'd me. SCENE III. The QUEEN, ELVIRA. QUEEN. Draw nearâElvira. ELVIRA. Now assist me, heaven! QUEEN. Your fears, perhaps, have form'd some direful image Of the King's wrath; some sanguinary purpose, By which your doom already is pronounc'd. Those fears repress, and with the calmest ear Attentive mark me. You, beneath this roof, Have wide-diffus'd the flames of hateful discord, It may be, undesigning; and the crime Your eyes have caus'd, your heart may disavow. ELVIRA. You judge me fairly, Madam! QUEEN. Yet, attend. I dare not think you share Don Pedro's fault, Encouraging the rebel in his breast By favor or connivance. You too well Must know the distance, not to be surpass'd, Betwixt you and the throne. It is a height A subject's eye must from afar behold, With reverent awe, but never hope to reach! I know you fair and virtuous: these endowments, That now adorn you, if bestow'd aright, May make you happy too. ELVIRA. What mean you, Madam? QUEEN. Hear what Alonzo speaks by me. He owns The state a debtor to your great forefathers, For conquests won, for blood profusely spilt, Not here alone in this our western world, But in remotest regions, where the sun Looks down direct at noon. He bids me dwell, With chief regard, on what he owes Alphonso, Your Grandsire, that good man who form'd his youth To love of virtue; whose paternal care Taught him, with no unequal hand, to wield This kingdom's sceptre. ELVIRA , aside. Whither tends her purpose? QUEEN. And when a king recounts a subject's worth, What he has prais'd his glory bids him pay With ample retribution. You shall find He now resolves no lessâRodrigo loves you; Rodrigo, near of kindred to the throne. I know he loves you. ELVIRA , aside. I am lost for ever! QUEEN. He oft has urg'd Alonzo to reward His ardent flame: and by a gift so noble, Your sovereign deems not his imperial house Diminish'd in its lustre. No: the world, By this great instance, shall be taught to know, He holds that man, who train'd a king to honor, As second only to the Prince he form'd. ELVIRA. I hear with wonder this exalted strain Of royal gratitude. Yet, Madam, think, The blood, they shed for him, of right was his; And to have lost it, at fair honor's voice, Its own bright recompence! He who is call'd To serve his country, if he has deserv'd That glorious trust, is paid by serving well! But if, too generous, great Alonzo's bounty Deigns to reward their services in me, Tho duty has no rightâ QUEEN. You hesitate. Speak boldly: let your amplest claim be shewn. ELVIRA. Then know, the sole return Elvira asksâ Is to be mistress of her humble fate; That far from courts, and to Rodrigo lost, She may with gentle peace live out her days! QUEEN. Your pride disdains him then? ELVIRA. Pride dwells not here: To such a guest this bosom is a stranger. QUEEN. Yet can refuse, thro mere humility, A prince from great Alonzo's blood deriv'd? And dare to tell it me? ELVIRA. I dare to think, That all the brightest honors Hymen spreads, When he would join our hands, are airy toys, Or glittering load; if love attends not too, To plight consenting hearts. QUEEN. I see thro yours! I fathom its last depth! ELVIRA. Then you may find, What equal Nature has to all indulg'd, Even to its poorest creatures, truth and worth, The inmates of this heart! QUEEN. To boast thy virtues Before thy queen is insult. ELVIRA. Madam, noâ O my full soul! [Aside.âbut justice done myself To you is highest reverence. Truth should ever Be found a subject's language to the throne: And I but meant to say, our weaker sex, Even I, may think up to that height of honor, Which in all ages has enobled Man! The same blest powerâ QUEEN. 'Tis well! thy soul is trac'd Thro all its doubling mazes. Those suspicions I sought to banish, now are truths confirm'd! Ambitious! yes, I mark the daring height, The wild excess, to which your pride of heart Elates imagination! you reserve That beauty for Don Pedro! you revolt A prince, a son, against his king and father! ELVIRA. You wrong me, madam. By the faith sincere I owe my king, this bosom never lodg'd A thought against his dignity or peace. And if the Princeâ[Aside. I shall betray my heartâ If I had power upon Don Pedro's will, Eternal Concord with her sheltering wing, Should ever guard the throne. QUEEN. And what is she, Whose great ambition busys thus itself In matters of such weight? unsummon'd too To this high task?âAm I awake? Elvira! What art thou? ELVIRA. Mock me notâA subject, madam; A subject and your servantâyet the child Of Reason, born to think and act with choice! Sprung too from such a race, so great and good, Their daughter dares not deviate into baseness, By wedding where she loves not! QUEEN. I have found it! A slave to this rebellious passion's force, Don Pedro burns to mount a vacant throne, That you may there be worship'd as his queenâ Ha! yetâwho knowsâit may, it may be true, That, spurning all the ties of sacred law, He is already yours! Perhaps, his fate A secret marriage has already fix'd! Should it be so, should he have sunk the throne To that disgraceâthe bolt is lanc'd already, That strikes you into dust! Your grand-sire, yes, The very man, whose loyalty I boasted, Prescrib'd this law. Think of it wellâAh heaven! [A great shout is heard, and the sound of trumpets at a distance. What mingled uproar this way swells its storm? SCENE. IV. The QUEEN, ELVIRA, MENDOZA. QUEEN. Mendoza! speak. MENDOZA. Madam, the city swarms, In every street, with multitudes enrag'd, Who to the palace urge their furious course. I came to knowâ SCENE V. The QUEEN, ELVIRA, MENDOZA. RODRIGO. Not here! Where is the king? QUEEN. Rodrigoâwhat! RODRIGO. The sum of all misfortunes! Arms in his hands and fury in his eyes, Don Pedro, with a host of gather'd rebels, Already fills the square, and threatens loudly Destruction on our headsâI must return: The king may want our swords. SCENE VI. The QUEEN, ELVIRA. QUEEN. Perfidious! see, Behold the curs'd effectsâ ELVIRA. O Madam, spare This fruitless insult. Can Elvira dread Your impotence of anger, while her fears Embrace alike Alonzo and his son? My bosom bleeds for both! But Oh the prince! Whate'er his fate may be, the same despair Abides this tortur'd heartâsince I must weep His life, or virtue, lost! QUEEN. And dares thy pride Affect this glorious sorrow, when 'tis you, You only who have plung'd him into guilt? But yetâand let it as the knell of death Sound in thine earâalone he shall not fall! The thunder o'er thy headâthink of itâthink Thou art my prisoner still! ELVIRA. I think withall, The death you threaten is but my enlargement From life's low dungeon, from its galling chains, To boundless freedom and to bliss supreme, Reserv'd by gracious heaven for every wretch Who suffers here unjustly! Trumpets sound again. SCENE VII. The QUEEN, ELVIRA, an Officer. QUEEN. Ha! what means Thy look of wild distraction? OFFICER. Mighty Queen, Don Pedroâ QUEEN. What of him? OFFICER. Has broken down The palace-gates; and now is rushing forward To where you standâ QUEEN. Confusion! he is hereâ SCENE VIII. DON PEDRO, ELVIRA. DON PEDRO , to those behind. Keep clear the secret passage; plant your friends Thro all its downward windings to the garden: I follow on the instant. Have I found thee, My heart's sole wealth, the jewel of my bosom! Let me secure it, let me lodge it safe Beyond the reach of robbers. ELVIRA. Ah Don Pedro! What have you done? O you have lost for ever A brighter gem, of dearer worth and price, Your Faith and Innocence! And now, your deed Opens my eyes on mine, and sets it full In all its horrors, all its guilt before me! DON PEDRO. Cruel! what mean thy words? ELVIRA. Ah me! what means This blood upon thy sword? Forbid it, heaven! That what my fears suggestâ DON PEDRO. Thy fears are vain. With care I shun'd where stern Alonzo stood, And stem'd the tide, majestic tho alone, Opposing a king's firmness to it's fury. I turn'd another way: and what you see, These sanguine stains are from a vulgar breast, That would have barr'd my passage on to you. Then, let us fly, my love. ELVIRA. Ah, hope it not. I dare to dyeâbut tremble at a crime! I dare be deaf to love itself, and you! Return, defend a parent and a king. Yes, throw that rebel-sword beneath his feet: I less shall suffer from the hand of fate, To lose you, innocent, than save you, guilty! DON PEDRO. What I have done, the meanest of mankind, The peasant, would have dar'd; have boldly met, With face erect, earth's universal Lord, Who from his cottage had presum'd to tear The partner of his bosom. ELVIRA. By the hold, I have upon your heart! More dear than life; Than fame itself more sacred! yet resume Your better thoughts. Let me behold your sorrow, Your filial penitenceâ DON PEDRO. Ah, let me then, Let me lodge Thee, where my distracted fondness No more may tremble for thy life. I then Return to beg an injur'd sovereign's mercy; To ask it at his knees: but, while I fear For thy dear safety, duty pleads in vain! ELVIRA. Then, know, Don Pedroâshould this guilty passion, Deaf to the voice of reason, take no counsel But from its headlong furyâhere I stay! I here remain, your hostage and your victim! DON PEDRO. Thou Angel-Cruelty! does then a wife Reject her husband's aidâ SCENE IX. ALMEYDA, ELVIRA, DON PEDRO. ALMEYDA. Don Pedro, fly! Your life is on the cast: this minute's chance Decides your future fate. Alonzo comes: Those clamouring multitudes, at sight of him, Shrunk into tame submission. Not their boldest Could bear the mingled dignity and wrath That threaten'd from his brow. Be gone, my Lord, Let not a father's vengeance find you here. ELVIRA. O unexampled goodness! DON PEDRO. Can it be? Do you take part, Almeyda, for his life, The life of One, who merits all your hate? ALMEYDA. Ah no! The jealousy of slighted love I stifle here. My soul is rais'd beyond The baseness of revenge. I pardon all, So you are safe. Fly then, this instant fly, Even were it with my rivalâ ELVIRA. See! Don Pedro, The King appearsâ SCENE X. ALONZO, DON PEDRO, ALMEYDA, ELVIRA. ALONZO. Yes, thou of many crimes! Thou complicated traitor! thou art lost, Where mercy cannot find theeâBut behold, Lo where he stands! Say, is thine arm still rais'd, Still eager for the sin of parricide? This instant yield thy sword; or plunge it here Full in a father's breast. DON PEDRO. That word, my Lord, That dreadful sound has wrench'd it from my hand. One moment's madness has not so effac'd Great Nature's law, that I should ballance here. And now, disarm'd, I know my ruin sure! My doom already past! But O, my Lord, O let impartial Justice draw her line, And separate strictly innocence from guilt! ALONZO. Ha! innocence? DON PEDRO. Elvira's safety, Sir, Unsheath'd my sword. I thought her life in danger: And to secure my bliss in guarding that, Tempestuous passion bore me into guilt. But her firm virtue, firm above all fear, Deny'd to be th'accomplice of my crime. She chose to stay, and answer with her life For my returning reason. Save such goodness: Protect it, Sir, from one revengeful arm. I ask no more. ALONZO. Far other cares should now Employ thy thoughts. To serve her better, know Thou shouldst defend her less. 'Tis thine to tremble For her and for thyself! DON PEDRO. If I must dye, Let Punishment at once lift up her axe, And strike this rebel: for, while life is mine, That life, in her defence, will be employ'd. You think this recent tumult quench'd and dead: An instant blows it into sevenfold flame. Your subjects then, let loose from all regards, May force my prison-doors, may set me free: And I, amidst the horrors of my rage, May to its deep foundations shake this realm! Do things that reason shudders but to think! In that wild storm, discerning, sparing none, Noble or base, but you and this fair princess! ELVIRA. His passion blinds him! All the guilt is mine, Who thus have arm'd a son against his sovereign. Then let my head attone it; let my death Restore that peaceâ ALONZO. Who waits?âConfine the Prince [Guards enter. To his apartment.â ALMEYDA. Dear unhappy youth! ALONZO. And guard him at the peril of your Heads. [Two conduct Don Pedro to his Apartment. Secure Elvira too. [She is attended to hers by two others. Stern Justiceâno, I have no son! I am no more a father! Follow me not To Almeyda.âI would avoid myself, Fly from mankind, forsake this hated light, And hide my woes in death's eternal night!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. RODRIGO, ALVAREZ. ALVAREZ. You seem much mov'd. RODRIGO. The horrid vision still Pursues my wounded fancy! ALVAREZ. Speak, my Lord, What have you seen? RODRIGO. I am not prone to shape Unreal forms, with Superstition's eye: But thus it was. There, in that reverend pile Where rest the bones of our departed kings, And where in animated marble rise Their sceptred forms around; as on my knees I pour'd to heaven my heart in secret prayer, At once a more than midnight-darkness spred O'er all the solemn scene: at once was heard A peal of groans, resounding from below! While sudden lightnings, darted thro' the gloom, Shew'd every sanguine statue red with blood! Chief that of old Alphonsoâyou have seen him, Elvira's grandsire. ALVAREZ. Yes: to crown whose virtues, The reigning Monarch plac'd his honor'd form Next those of our dead kings. RODRIGO. The very same. Down his stain'd armor ran the crimson drops, And his shook image trembled on its base! Now, if I live, I saw it. ALVAREZ. That good angel, Who watches o'er our state, avert the dangers Such omens may foreshewâThe King! he gnaws His angry lip, and storm is on his brow. SCENE II. ALONZO, RODRIGO, ALVAREZ. ALONZO. Thenâit is fix'dâThe Lords that you have summon'd, Say, are they come? ALVAREZ. They wait your pleasure, Sir, In the near council-chamberâ ALONZO. Aside. Could they see Their sovereign's breast unveil'd! but no: the curtain Must be close-drawn, that each man may advise As unimpassion'd reason guides himâLeave me. SCENE III. ALONZO. Advise!âThou general Parent of mankind! Who bidst thy sun arise, thy rain descend On all the various creatures thou hast made, Just and unjust alike! is one sad father Reserved, in his grey years, himself to punish A lov'd, an only son? And must he sit In judgment on him? hear the doom of deathâ My soul revolts, all nature in my bosom Shrinks and starts back from this detested duty; But 'tis a King'sâand thou, Alonzo, thou Art he, that king! O did the beggar know What splendid misery is lodg'd within The circle of a crown, he would not stoop His palsy'd hand to take it from the dust, And be its wearerâWhat, or how determine? Was it for this I weary'd heaven with vows To give my throne an heir? Was it in wrath, Heaven granted my request? and have I form'd His youth to glory, seen his steps outrun The swiftest in her race, that he, this son, With her fresh laurel wreath'd, should bleed at last Beneath the murderous axe? Guardsâbring my son; Conduct Don Pedro hither. Once, once more I mean to hear himâcould I pardon too, I yet were blest! for my torn bosom feels The pangs of guilt, in following Virtue's call. Then summon all the monarch to thine aid! For think, the present, think, each future age Will fix their eyes of censure or applause On this one act of thine. Altho a father, That private name must bend before the large, The universal duties of a sovereign. Quit we the sceptre, or its rights assert; Chastise offence, while weeping o'er th'offender: That humankind may tremble to transgress, Who see inexorable Justice stretch, O'er all alike, her rod of punishment; Not even a prince, a throne's immediate heir Exempted from her arm! SCENE IV. ALONZO, DON PEDRO. ALONZO. The council, Prince, Is now assembling. Your own breast must tell you Th'inevitable sentence it will pass: And when your fury plung'd you into guilt, You on yourself pronounc'd it. Yet there is, There still remains one door of mercy open: Take warning then in time. Your prompt obedience, To me a son, to you restores a father. Fulfill the treaty, wed that virtuous Princess: You live on these conditions. These refus'dâ I may be wretchedâbut your doom is past! DON PEDRO. Thenâknow your Son, with all his failings on him. My Soul, like yours, thus guilty as I am, Beholds, unmov'd, the nearest face of danger: And you would blush, would deeply blush for both, If fear or force debas'd me to submission. What love and reverence, to a parent due, Could not persuade, no tortures can obtain. ALONZO. Thou Cruel! why, deserving all my hate, Preserve this greatness, that but more embitters The grief I feel already? Shew me rather A mortal enemy, a Son ingrate Prepar'd to strike his parricidal knife Deep thro my heart. Reduc'd to wish thy death, Let me behold it tooâwithout despair! DON PEDRO. I have deserv'd to die. ALONZO. My pity still Would bid thee live. DON PEDRO. What must I do? ALONZO. Obey! DON PEDRO. Then all is o'er. It cannot be. ALONZO. Retireâ A tear would followâbut I blot it out. SCENE V. The back scene opens and discovers the Lords of the council met, RODRIGO, ALVAREZ, and others. The King walks slowly up to his chair of State. ALONZO. Be seated, LordsâAlas! I look around, And read on every face the secret pangs Your bosoms share with mine. The ready drop Stands trembling in each eye, as if yourselves Had each a son to judge and to condemn! But let us rise above all private feelings; Remorse should have no place, where Justice reigns: And those, whom heaven appoints to counsel kings, Must shed no tear, but for offended laws. All other grief is weakness, or is guilt. The Prince, a rebel to the law and us, Has set at nought the binding faith of oaths; The solemn ties of treaties ratify'd, Whatever links one nation to another, And king to king. Nor is this all. You saw, With horror and astonishment you saw him, In arms and at the head of traitors arm'd, Assault this palace! force its gates against me! And, if he shun'd himself the guilt supreme Of parricide, he left his king expos'd, His father at the mercy of those rebels Whom he had made so!âThese are his offences. 'Tis yours to judge them, and pronounce his doom. Rodrigo, speak. RODRIGO. Alas! I should be silent. You know, and have approv'd the tender love I bear Elvira. To my happiness Don Pedro is the sole, the fatal bar: And you command me, Sir, to judge a rival! But far be from me each imagin'd hope, However dear, that but respects myself! Is it a question, can it bear debate, If he, tho deem'd a criminal, should live? Search your own breast: the powerful pleadings there Will best inform you what I should advise. Forgive, my Lord, this transport. ALONZO. Let calm reason Guide all you say. Proceed. RODRIGO. I ask again, Is it in question, whether your renown Should live by him, or be for ever lost? Heâand there is none otherâcan support The sceptre's weight; he only, after you, Preserve this kingdom flourishing and happy. Weigh then, with candor weigh, against his crime, Th'acknowledg'd prize of benefits like these. ALONZO. But treaties seal'd, and sanctify'd by oaths, He dares to violate. RODRIGO. Are treaties then, But leagues of regal cruelty and force? Must you, to please a neighbouring monarch's pride, In your own son exterminate your race? Extinguish every future hope? and would not The cheek of Ferdinand burn red with shame, Should his lov'd sister owe a husband's hand To cold obedience; while, in other realms, New thrones, new hearts, attend the fair one's choice? He forc'd the palace gates. The crime is own'd: But no design against your crown or person Urg'd that blind violence. Alas! his aim Was but to screen th'endanger'd life of one, His fondness trembled for. You see him thusâ A rebel? no: a lover in despair! And can a moment's rashness merit death? No: let him liveâand tho my bosom bleeds At what I utterâyes, indulge his love! His life is all: a life like mine is nothing! ALONZO. You prove the blood you spring from: and this effort, This generous violence you do your heart, While it misleads, both honors and exalts you. But 'tis the hero, not the judge has spoken. What says Alvarez? ALVAREZ. Could your eye, my Lord, Pierce inward to my heart, the conflict there, The war that gratitude and duty wage, Would leave it doubtful which you most should pity, Don Pedro or his judge. He sav'd my life. Beneath an African's uplifted sabre, Faint, bleeding thro my former wounds, I lay. He saw, he flew, and on his shield receiv'd Th'impending sword! Was it, good heaven, for this, That I, who but for his protecting arm Had now been dust, should sit to judge his fate? Ah no, my Lord: I would be dumb for ever! ALONZO. Fair honor and the duty of this place Exact it of you; call on you to speak By truth's unbiass'd dictates. This great cause Imports ourself, our realm, and all mankind. ALVAREZ. Alas, my Lord, to what alternate horror, As subject and as man, am I expos'd? But hence all private ties, the first and dearest! My life is his; my duty, Sir, is yours: And from the fear, so busy here within, Of being deem'd ungrateful to a friend, I dare not be a traitor to my king. The law has spoke. His sentence is pronounc'd, Is past already; in despight of tears, Of all the pain'd reluctance pity strives with: For when the sovereign majesty of kings Is once invaded, but one way remains To expiate that offence. Th'insulted rights, You sit to judge of, are not yours. They grow Inherent to the throne: And you, my Lord, Are to all present, all succeeding princes Accountable for what you now decree. I go too far. ALONZO. Proceed. ALVAREZ. It cannot be: Tears choak my voice. ALONZO. Keep nothing from my view: Thy virtue here demands it. ALVAREZ. I obey. Should pity now prevail in his behalf, You are no more a king! You reign at mercy Of winds and seas in his ungovern'd passions! Your subjects too, the rebels of to-day, Who now will think him formidably theirs, Are from this moment his. A nod from him Will be their law; and each licentious hour Wear its red mark of civil broils and murders: The crown, the sceptre may remain with you, The power, that should sustain them, will be his! ALONZO. Heroic proof of loyalty and truth! I can discern the painful throes of soul This firmness costs thee: but its felt ascendant, The sovereign influence of such virtue, chides Fond nature from my bosom. Now, who else Among you, Lords, stands forth to give his suffrage?â What! no one rise?âAlas! the tears that stream From each dejected eye, this mournful silence, Big with all horror, but too clearly speak, What you have judg'dâMy son is then condemn'd! For you, for all my people, for mankind, I here devote himâWere I but a father, He still might liveâA monarch must be just: Who has betray'd the law would be a tyrant! He shall not reign: No, from that threaten'd danger I now deliver you, your wives, and children. Let all retire: and you, Mendoza, go, Inform him of his fateâ SCENE V. ALONZO. What will be mine? O tyrant-Duty! art thou satisfy'd, While I with Roman names of cruel greatness, With Brutus, Manlius, share the fame abhorr'd Of being more, or less, than man was meant? But how? or when?âThe blackest hour of night Must cover this dire deedâHa! there, behold Th'uplifted axe! Ha heaven! it fallsâand lo A headless trunk! a scaffold red with blood! O thou, All-Just, who doom'd me to a throne! Why, with its duties, leave this writhing bosom Accessible to pangs, that but a Child Can pierce the soul withâand a Parent know? SCENE VI. ALONZO, the QUEEN, ALMEYDA. ALMEYDA. What have I heard? This most inhuman sentence Is it then past? Each face bedew'd with tears, And every eye cast in despair on heaven, I saw the Council part: and on your brow I read my fate in characters of horror! You have condemn'd your son! ALONZO. I have done justice. ALMEYDA. O heaven! can you avow, and can I hear it? QUEEN. This wound, my Lord, must in a father's heart Be deeply felt. Why, by his guilty rashness, Why has Don Pedro push'd you to the brink Of dire necessityâ ALONZO. Madam, no more, If in obedience to relentless duty, If deaf to all that bleeding Love can plead In this sad bosom, I condemn a son; 'Tis yours to think, that mercy was his due. Unhappy boy! alas it is too plain, He has no mother. SCENE VII. The QUEEN, ALMEYDA. ALMEYDA. If my life is dear To her who gave it, seize, O seize, this momentâ You see Alonzo softening into natureâ Kneel, press, adjure himâand you save the prince! QUEEN. I go. Your pains and pleasures all are mine: Be most assur'd they areâAnd, tho' the skies Look frowning round us, yet methinks a beam Of day-light breaks upon the doubtful horror! It lights meâyes, it points the secret path, I should pursue! Almeydaâtrust to me. SCENE VIII. ALMEYDA. Sir, bring your prisoner: by the Queen's command I have to talk with her. [Guard goes out. It must be soâ Yes, to preserve him, I will stoop to beg A rival's aid. Even should he live for her; Is any price too high, at which we save The life of him we love? She comesâ SCENE IX. ALMEYDA, ELVIRA. ALMEYDA. Alas! Don Pedro is found guilty! ELVIRA. O despair! O death to all my hopes! ALMEYDA. Elvira, now, On this important, this deciding moment Our mutual fate depends. You long have mark'd My passion for the prince; that, in despite Of scorn in him, of jealousy in me, Beyond whatever nature else can boast I hold him dearâ ELVIRA. I have with heart-felt grief, And flowing eyes beheld itâand even now They stream afresh! ALMEYDA. The Queen is gone to try Her tenderest influence on a husband's heart. I too will clasp his knees, and beg for mercy: But will these arts, these little aids prevail Against his dread severity of nature? If you have thought, or if inventive Love Can prompt your breast with more successful means, Advise, Elvira; for your counsels here Shall be my law. Whatever you suggest, At peril of my life I will perform. ELVIRA. Ah! how reply? What equal answer find To such exalted worth? All that my thought Is big with, your true virtue, my distress, All press me with confusion. In your sight The Prince must seem ungrateful and unjust; And I a worthless rival, cast beneath Your least regard. ALMEYDA. Let virtue make us equal. The Prince to both is dear: let both unite, Without a farther thought, to save his life. ELVIRA. O amiable goodness! Wonder fills And joy again attempts to chear my bosom! There rises to my eye one glimpse of light, One ray of hope: but you, and only you Can make it real. Closely here confin'd, Alas! I have no meansâGo thenâand heaven Suceed your purpose! from the King intreat, Obtain a moment's audience for Elviraâ I yet may calm his anger; yet prolong Don Pedro's threaten'd daysâperhaps for you! ALMEYDA. It would be cruel, as 'tis most unjust, To think such hopes could animate my zeal. Elvira, no: the fire that warms this breast Is of a purer beam. I go to find Th'unhappy King; with prayers and tears to try If he is yet a parent, or a man! ELVIRA. O may the fair attempt successful prove! May stern Alonzo hear the voice of love! O may we both preserve, what both adore! So he but livesâI ask of heaven no more! The guards conduct her back. End of the fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. MENDOZA, RAMIREZ. RAMIREZ. Condemn'd to die, you say? MENDOZA. This very moment The fatal preparations are begun; The gloomy pomp that shews us death more dreadful! Surrounding guards, whose silence terrifies Beyond the din of their conflicting arms; The bloody theatre, with cypress hungâ Alas! the color that ten thousand mourners Must shortly wearâAnd then the victim comes! 'Tis horrible to thought! RAMIREZ. Who has in charge To see this murder done? MENDOZA. On me, my friend, On me the cruel duty is impos'd By our relentless Master. RAMIREZ. Is the hour Appointed, and the place? MENDOZA. Both, both are fix'd: And when the midnight-bell with mournful call Tolls up the cloister'd Fathers of Saint Francis, Who have been nam'd on his departing soul To beg heaven's mercyâwhen that fatal warning Has struck my ear, Don Pedro is brought forth. RAMIREZ. And whither then? MENDOZA. To that sequester'd spot, Wall'd high around, where oft the noblest blood Of Portugal has flow'd. 'Tis there the Prince Must lose his head. RAMIREZ. Mine shall be risk'd, by heaven! Nor mine alone: a thousand more shall fall, Ere that inhuman sentence takes effect. A deed like this will stain our hated annals Thro all descending time. Let us prevent it. The people, still tumultuous, like their sea, May soon be blown into a second storm. It shall be try'd. MENDOZA. You cast yourself away, And serve not him your friendship aims to save. The palace-gates are strongly barr'd; at each A triple guard is planted: and the King Commands, on pain of death, that none approach him. RAMIREZ. But sure these orders are not for the Queen: And she, a woman, by those tender feelings, That are her sex's glory, must be sway'dâ She moves this way, and with her, fair Almeyda. SCENE II. The QUEEN, ALMEYDA, MENDOZA, RAMIREZ. O Queen! and you, lov'd Princess! hear me speakâ QUEEN. Withdraw at once. RAMIREZ. Don Pedro, gracious Mistressâ QUEEN. Ha!âleave usâgo. RAMIREZ. Heaven! in her latest hour, When she would plead to thee, remember this! SCENE III. The QUEEN, ALMEYDA. QUEEN. Elvira see the King! What hast thou done? Dishonor'd as we are, you seem to dread The vengeance due to your disgrace and mine. Far from resenting these repeated insults, You, by your tears, solicite new and greater; For they may live, the hated pair may live To see our mutual shame, and triumph o'er it! ALMEYDA. Let not the pious meltings of compassion Offend you, Madam. Let her virtue still Be your Almeyda's happiness and pride. QUEEN. What is your aim? what visionary purpose Deceives you into wishing they may meet? 'Tis madness all. ALMEYDA. When Lisbon first beheld It blest your daughter's steps. As Peace and Ease Came, her companions, shouting thousands rais'd Her name to heaven, and hail'd their guardian-genius. But what a peace, good Angels? writ in blood, And seal'd with murder! Was I then but meant The Messenger of heaven's severest vengeance? To tear asunder nature's closest ties; And by the Sire assassinate the Son? 'Tis more than horror! May Elvira's tears Prevent these threaten'd mischiefsâ QUEEN. May the rage, This bosom swells with, rather be asswag'd By seeing both expire! Rejected? heaven! The daughter of a king! in whose high veins Flows undebas'd from a long line of heroes The noblest blood! Shall Europe hear it told, She has been set at nought? Ha!âand for whom? Degenerate boy! I, with my own, could purchase His death, this moment! ALMEYDA. Do you then wish mine? QUEEN. Ah, can'st thou love him still? ALMEYDA. I still adore him, Ungrateful, cruel as he is! QUEEN. O shame! O fall ignoble from the high rais'd sense Of that resentment, wrongs like ours demand, Nay sanctify, and make our vengeance, virtue! Can she, a child of mine, whose every pulse Should beat with driving fury and disdain, Whose bosom should expand to take in all That brave revenge avows, thus melt away In tears and sighs? like some fond village-maid Beneath her willow, by the brook obscure That soothes her amorous folly? ALMEYDA. O yet think, There is revenge more noble, more divine, That spreads no blush upon the injur'd cheek, By rendering good for ill. QUEEN. My Ferdinand! Son of thy mother's soul, when thou shalt know Thy sister's abject spirit, thus resign'd To injuries and scorn, thy breast will flame With anger uncontroul'd! On thee alone My hopes, my life dependâWho waits?â'Tis glory To fall reveng'd. GUARD. Your pleasure, Madam? QUEEN. Go, Call in th'Ambassador of Spain. ALMEYDA. Ah me, Whence this new storm of passion? Enter AMBASSADOR. QUEEN. You have had Your audience. Then be gone; this moment go; On all the wings of haste to Spain return: And there, this letter, as you prize your head, Deliver on the instant to my son. Yet, stayâYou may be useful, and inforce With your best reason what my letter urges; That he should arm incessantly, and lead His troops the nearest road towards hated Lisbon. Extremest need, mine and Almeyda's safety, Requires he should. That writing will explain What else remains. Exit Ambassador. My brain turns roundâAscend From night eternal and profoundest hell, Ye Powers of vengeance! Punish home with me This object of my hate! thro all her frame Spread fires unquench'd! then, with his funeral torch, Let Death attend, to light her bridal bed! And thus compleat my great revenge, as fits A mother and a Queen! SCENE IV. ALMEDYA. My blood stops short And freezes in its course to hear her threats. But love and rage distract her. SCENE V. ALONZO, ALMEYDA. ALONZO. Princess, yes, Your tears have vanquish'd. I will hear Elvira: But be most sure her hopes are empty air. Leave me: she comes. SCENE VI. ALONZO, ELVIRA. ELVIRA. This moment, Sir, This awful moment is, perhaps, the last That e'er Elvira's voice shall reach your ear, Or sight offend your eyeâBut let me now Intreat this guard may goâHe is already Possess'd of what I purpose. ALONZO. Be it so. Do what you have in charge. ELVIRA. Speed wing thy steps! You have, against the voice of earth and heaven, To day condemn'd your first, your only hope! A Son who loves you, who reveres the voice That dooms him to the block! an early Hero, By you belov'dâO heaven!âand tho I see Remorse sit sad and silent on your brow, You yet devote this victim; that mankind With dread amazement may revere the Justice, They tremble to beholdâYou turn awayâ May I proceed? ALONZO. Go on. ELVIRA. Thus far is well: But thenâ'tis still the first, the law supreme, On kings most binding, to be just in all. Guilt may appear, where yet no crime is found; A rebel, an ingrate, deserves to die. And yet these names may not belong to him, To your unhappy Son. ALONZO. Thy words are wild: Despair and love thy reason have unsettled. ELVIRA. Ah noâIf he, against the faith of treaties, Refus'd Almeyda's hand, it was not, Sirâ Believe these tearsâ'twas not the crime suppos'd Of disobedienceâ ALONZO. How! ELVIRA. And if he forc'd These palace-gates, his noble soul abhorr'd All criminal attempt against his king. A word, a breath his innocence had prov'd: But he, a hero in his cruel silence, To save Elvira, greatly chose to die! 'Tis therefore mine, the sole remaining purpose Of my last hour, to clear his injur'd name; And lead you into truth. Don Pedro's faults Were those of duty, SirâHe is my husband! ALONZO. Ha! husband! he! my son!âAnd dares thy fondness Think, by discovery of this daring crime, To move compassion? When no hope remains Of grace to his offence, dost thou presume On mercy for thy own acknowledg'd guilt? ELVIRA. I ask for none! my parting thoughts are fix'd On something nobler, dearer far than life. The rigid law, by you declar'd inviolable, I only have transgress'dâ ALONZO. True: and thy life The penalty shall pay. ELVIRA. It is most just. I bring no plea, I urge no vain defence, That love for himâsuch love as would in heaven Be held no crimeâ ALONZO. Awayâthat very love Makes thee but still more guilty! ELVIRA. Sir, recall The dreadful moment, when your court beheld This Son, this blooming promise of a hero, His eye extinguish'd and his fading cheek Of its fresh rose forsaken, to the grave Untimely sinking! and a father's tears In hopeless silence streaming o'er his face! I urge it not, that, to preserve his youth, And save your only hope, I gave my hand Where I had vow'd my heartâI urge not this: But now at last devote myself for both! In death exulting to have sav'd him twice! ALONZO. Thro all the horrors guilt has thrown around thee, Thy virtue yet looks lovelyâbut in vain: Thy crime and his stand manifest to view, And what the laws exact shall be fulfill'd. ELVIRA. Just heaven! shouldst thou, when kings address thy throne For mercy on their own offences, then Be deaf to them, as he is now to meâ But on, my Lord; pursue these savage-maxims; Without remorse consummate your revenge! Yet, other victims, other heads attend, To satiate its full furyâSee, O King! Lo! where they standâ [Her two children are brought in by their Governess. Acknowledge them for yours, By dooming both to bleed! ALONZO. Ye holy Powers! What do I see? ELVIRA. Yes, by one common fate, Wife, children, husbandâlet us perish all! ALONZO. What say'st thou!âJustice! Mercy! how ye rend My heart! ELVIRA. Forgive the language of despair. My children, kneel with me. Your infant-tears May wake at last the parent in his breast. Sir, they are yoursâbehold them not as mine. The law demands a victim: here, on me Exhaust its utmost rageâbut O, to these A father save, and to yourself a son! Yet some few moments from his ear conceal Elvira's deathâfor should it reach him now, His own too sure would followâ ALONZO. Call my son! Fly, let him knowâElvira is his own! My daughterâ ELVIRA. O unutterable Joy! Here at your feet, to heaven and you I pour My grateful bosomâ ALONZO. Nature! thou hast conquer'd. I am a man, a father!âRise, Elvira; Live, and be happy longâO my dear children! Take, take me allâ SCENE VII. ALONZO, ELVIRA, DON PEDRO. ALONZO. My son! DON PEDRO. My King and father! Elviraâfrom the grave to me restor'd! To these despairing arms!âand you my little ones! ELVIRA. O I am blestâbeyond all utterance blest! And my transported heartâAh meâ ALONZO. Elvira! Thy cheek is pale! ELVIRA. Oh I have death within me! DON PEDRO. This flood of Joy, my soul's best happiness, O'erpowers thy tender frame. ELVIRA. Ah no, I burn: A kindled furnace rages in my bosomâ Convulsions shake meâsweats of death bedew My trembling limbs! DON PEDRO. O Source of life! look down With pity on herâ ELVIRA. Ha! a sudden night Spreads dark aroundâYou swim before my eyesâ Their light is lost!âbut I will hold you fastâ Again I burn! ALONZO. O most inhuman Queen! This Stygian draught, too sure, was by thy hand, Thy fatal hand prepar'd. DON PEDRO. Did heaven look on And suffer this?âYet, by my soul's strong anguish! Not she alone, her Spain shall weep in blood This deed accurst! ELVIRA. 'Tis pastâDon Pedro, love My memoryâAlonzo, cherish theseâ O my poor babes!âand bless their dying mother! But that fair princessâyes, reward for me Her nobleness of virtueâMy lov'd Lord! These arms would fold thee stillâbut Ohâ ALONZO. She diesâ In that last sigh the gentle spirit fled! DON PEDRO. Mine shall rejoin it, ere it finds that heaven Prepar'd for souls like hersâI will not live? This sword restor'dâ ALONZO , seizing his hand. AwayâShall fury still Sway all thy actions? No: reward her truth A nobler way. These Infants claim thy care: And thou must suffer life, to guide their steps Safe from the snares that courtly Fraud and Falsehood Spread daily in a youthful Prince's walk; Spread for his ruin. And now, warn'd thyself, Let all mankind, by one example, know, From passions unrestrain'd what mischiefs grow! THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. By Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. Cibber. Ladies and Gentlemenâ'Tis so ill bredâ We have no Epilogue, because I'm dead; For he, our Bard, with frenzy-rolling eye, Swears you shan't laugh, when he has made you cry. At which I gave his sleeve a gentle pull, Suppose they should not cry, and should be dull: In such a case, 'twould surely do no harm, A little lively nonsense taken warm: On critick stomacks delicate and queasy, 'Twill ev'n make a heavy meal sit easy. The town hates Epiloguesâit is not true, I answer'd that for youâand youâand youâ (To pit, boxes, and 1st gallery.) They call for Epilogues, and Hornpipes tooâ (To the upper gallery.) Madam, the Criticks sayâTo you they're civil, Here if they have'em not; they'll play the devil; Out of this house, Sir, and to you alone, They'll smile, cry Bravo! Charming!âHere they groan: A single critick will not frown, look big, Harmless and pliant as a single twig, But crouded here they change, and 'tis not odd, For twigs, when bundled up, become a rod. Criticks to bards, like beauties to each other, When tÃ¨te Ã  tÃ¨te their enmity they smother; Kiss me, my dearâhow do you?âCharming creature! What shape! what bloom! what spirit in each feature! You flatter me,â'pon honor, No.âYou doâ My friendâmy dearâsincerely yoursâadieu! But when at Routs, the dear friends change their toneâ I speak of foreign ladies, not our own. Will you permit, good Sirs, these gloomy folk, To give all tragedy, without one joke? They gravely tell usâtragedy's design'd, To purge the passions, purify the mind; To which I say, to strike those blockheads dumb, With physick, always give a sugar plumb; I love these sugar plumbs in prose or rhimes; No one is merrier than myself some times; Yet I, poor I, with tears and constant moan, Am melted down almost to skin and bone: This night, in sighs and sobs I drew my breath; Love, marriage, treason, prison, poison, death, Were scarce sufficient to compleat my fate; Two children were thrown in to make up weight. With all these suff'rings, is it not provoking, To be deny'd at last a little joking? If they will make new laws, for mirth's sakeâbreak 'em, Roar out for Epilogues, and let me speak 'em.</field>
