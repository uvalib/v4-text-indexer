      <field name="fulltext">THE EPHESIAN MATRON. A COMIC SERENATA, After the Manner of the Italian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. The FATHER, Mr. Legg. The CENTURION, Mr. Dibdin. The MATRON, Mrs. Baddely. The MAID, Mrs. Thompson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. The Scene is supposed to lie in a Tomb, near the City of Ephesus. A Lamp burning; on one Side a dead Body. The Matron clasping her Husband's Corps; her Father, and her Maid endeavouring to force her away. TRIO. Matron. Hence, hence! away; in vain you strive To tear me from my dear dead man; His wife I am, dead or alive, My love shall end where it began. Father. But daughterâ Maid. Mistressâ Matron. Grief, O Grief! 1., 2. Will staying here bring him relief? To molder with him in the grave Is killing two. Matron. Adieu, adieu; To die with him is all I crave. 1., 2. Some comfort takeâ Matron. My heart will break. 1., 2. And with us go. Matron. No, no, no, no. Oh, oh, oh, oh! 1., 2. You shall, you must. Matron. No, his dear dust By me shall never be deserted; But here I'll stay, Both night and day, Till Death has join'd whom Death hath parted. FATHER. Well, daughter, since intreaties all are vain, And still your purpose you maintain To give a sample Of nuptial love, And so to prove To future wives a rare example, I leave you to your fate. The sad but glorious work complete, And since all else your constancy denies, When Death, as soon he must, hath clos'd your eyes, Your weeping father shall returnâ You cannot hinder him to mournâ And with due rites perform your obsequies. AIR. But moreâA monument I'll raise, Where, sacred to your endless praise, This just inscription shall be read: âNipt in the flow'r of charms and youth, âA miracle of female truth âLies here inroll'd among the dead. âStop traveller, and, drawing near, âBestow the tribute of a tear. âDeath snatch'd her consort from her side; âShe lov'd, she sorrow'd, and she died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. The Matron, the Maid. MATRON. At length we're left alone, And the sad widow may indulge her moan. Receive me, earth, upon thy flinty breast, Helpless, forlorn, undone, with pain opprest: AIR. And while, grown frantic with my woes, I beat my bosom, tear my hair, Come, ye furies; come, despair; And grief that never comfort knows; All your horrors here display; Nor thou, O Death! be long away. MAID. So, there she lies upon the floor! There never was such madness sure. And will you, in the dreary gloom Of this unwholesome tomb, In sighs and tears your life consume? MATRON. What shou'd a wretched widow do? MAID. You're young and handsome yet, And might another husband get; Ay, that you mightâor two. MATRON. No, no, I death prefer. MAID. The more fool you. MATRON. This only I entreat, my faithful maid, That with me here you'll stay, And see my breathless clay, When I am dead, by my dear husband laid. MAID. Well, Madam, since I must I will. But give me leave to say, You'd better change your purpose still, And act a wiser way. AIR. If I was a wife, and my dearest dear life, Took it into his noddle to die, E'er I took the whim, to be buried with him, I think I'd know very well why. If poignant my grief, I'd search for relief, Not sink with the weight of my care; A salve might be found, no doubt, above ground, And I think I know very well where. Another kind mate shou'd give me what Fate Wou'd not from the former allow: With him I'd amuse, the hours you abuse, And I think I'd know very well how. 'Tis true I'm a maid, and so't may be said No judge of the conjugal lot; Yet marriage, I ween, has a cure for the spleen, And I think I know very well what.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. The Centurion, the Maid, the Matron on the Ground by her Husband's Body. CENTURION. Ho, who's there below? MAID. Bless us! I shall die with fear! A man descends into the cave! What shall our lives our honours save! CENTURION. Hey, who the devil have we here? MAID. A handsome fellow, never stir! CENTURION. Speak. MAID. Two sad women, worthy Sir. A Matron, and my mistress, she Who there upon the ground you see: Her consort dy'd some days ago, Which griev'd the poor dear lady so, That, being here last night inter'dâ I think the like was never heardâ She wou'd needs be buried too. And now, Sir, tell me who are you. CENTURION. A soldierâstanding at my post, To guard yon gibbets on the coast, I saw a light, and hither came, Directed by the glimmering flame. MAID. My mistress, Sir, is much to blame. Noble, and rich, and young, and fairâ CENTURION. Her character is something rare. Softâharkenâyesâshe draws her breath. MAID. Besides she's almost starved to death. Two days she has not eat a bit. CENTURION. I'll rouse her from this desperate fit. AIR. Lovely dame, what, ho! what, ho! From the depths of pain and woe, A soldier calls your beauty. And can bravery do less? To succour ladies in distress, Is still the soldier's duty. Cupid whispers in your ear, And will you refuse to hear, Accents form'd to move? Oh! lovely dame, For shame, for shame! Shall one so fair, Be kill'd by care? Rise to life and love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. The Centurion, the Maid, the Matron rising from the Ground. MATRON. Who'd comfort to a wretch afford? Gone near half way to meet my lord, You fetch me back. MAID. Upon my word, I'm very glad your journey's stopt. CENTURION. Fair creature, gentler thoughts adopt; You have fulfill'd your nuptial vow; To yourself do justice now; Nor sacrifice, by cruel wrong, A nymph so handsome and so young. MAID. The rogue has a bewitching tongue. MATRON. He's very good I must allow, To take a widow's part so kindly. CENTURION. Then follow not destruction blindly; Nor the gifts of Heav'n abuse, But eat and live. MATRON. Indeed, I swore Never to taste a morsel more: But since through pity you intrude Upon my sorrows, 'twould be rude The proffer'd succour to refuse. CENTURION. Here is the meat, my lovely dear! But first your drooping spirits cheer. A flask of wine I've got by stealth: 'Tis strong and old, And from the cold Upon my post this night has fenc'd me. MATRON. I vow and swear it goes against me: HoweverâSir, your health. DUET. Centu. By Venus, mother of desire, Your eyes have set me all on fire! There's magic in your touch. Matron. My eyes! dear Sirâa-well-a-day! Tears must have wash'd their power away: Indeed you say too much. Centu. My heart is Cupid's drum, He beats a march and cries, Come, Come, follow me your chief. Matron. My heart's in perturbation; I too, feel a palpitation; But 'tis the effects of grief. A., 2. What shall I do! O tell me, who Can ease the pangs I feel? 'Tis loveâ'tis grief, Bring some relief, A wounded heart to heal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. The Centurion taking his Leave, the Matron, the Maid. CENTURION. A moment now I must be gone; I guard hard by some gibbet thieves; Another soon my watch relieves, I will be here again anon. MATRON. Well, if you must be gone, you must, No soldier shou'd neglect his post: But I will candidly confess, Your care was soothing my distress; And 'twould have pleased me cou'd you just Have staid to see meâgive up the ghost. AIR. But before you go away, Sir, As we ne'er may meet again; Give me leave to thank you, pray Sir, For the gen'rous care you've ta'en. Well your candour might impeach me, Was I blind to your desert; But, tho' love can never reach me, Friendship still may touch my heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. Matron, Maid. MAID. A sweeter man I never saw! He might give woman-kind the law. He talks and moves with so much grace!â And then he has a charming face. MATRON. Dear girl, this is a shocking place; So dark and dismalâthen the smell Is really overcoming. MAID. Well. Why don't you leave it? MATRON. Leave!âwho, I! Have I not sworn that here I'll die? MAID. Such oaths are better broke than kept; Enough you've sigh'd, enough you've wept; With this young fellow quit the cave; He's worth three dead men. MATRON. Sure you rave. He wou'd not yield his youth to chear A weeping widow. MAID. Never fear. MATRON. And shou'd I lightly seem inclined, What wou'd the world say? MAID. Never mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. The Matron, the Maid, the Centurion in a Fright. AIR. Centu. Zounds! I'm undone! Where shall I run? They've stol'n a thief from the gibbet! And, when I'm in his place, As will soon be the case, A fine figure I shall exhibit. MAID. Bless us, what storm is now a brewing? MATRON. What is the matter? CENTURION. Death and ruin. While love with you prolong'd my stay, Some rogues have watch'd their time, And, from the gibbet, stol'n a thief away. The magistrates to me will lay the crime; And when 'tis miss'd, and I before 'em, That other centinels their watch may keep, I know they'll hang me in terrorem. MATRON. Hang you! MAID. I vow it makes me weep. MATRON. Is there no shift? CENTURION. No, none. MAID. 'Tis true. CENTURION. Farewell! eternally adieu. This night I shall have cause to rue. MATRON. Hold! there's a thought come in my head! My husband is already dead, And consequently has no feeling; And 'twou'd be very cruel dealing To let you suffer for my sake: Yonder he lies, his body take; Strip off the shroud, and hang it where The robber has been taken down. MAID. A fine contrivance this, I swear. MATRON. While they see a body there, The diff'rence never will be known. Fate would my husband from me rend, But shan't, if I can help it, take my friend. MAID. Thus of all fear, at once, she rids you. CENTURION. How shall I thankâ MAID. By doing as she bids you. AIR. Men talk of their prudence and sense, And make a strange pother With this, that, and t'other, But, gad, it is all a pretence. Their genius is trivial and common, And for a shift, At a dead lift, There's nought like the wit of a woman. To that every spring is obedient; And for ways and for means, If to meddle she deigns, No premier of state, Like her can create Or find you out an expedient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VIII. The Matron, the Maid, the Father, the Centurion. MATRON. My father comes, and with him brings The soldier. MAID. Bless us! more strange things! FATHER. Daughter, e'er this, I thought you dead; And by paternal fondness led From the city sadly came To pay those dues the dead may claim. But near the tomb I met this man; Your husband's body on his back. MATRON. Name not my husband, Sir.âAlack! FATHER. First, to accuse him, I began, And call'd him robber of the dead; But you approv'd the deed he said; Now, tell me, is there truth in this? MAID. I'll answer for my lady,âYes. FATHER. If that by any proof appears, Her wedding-day she settles straight. CENTURION. Say, dear, how long is't I must wait? FATHER. Come, name your time, child. MATRON. Seven years. MAID. Sooner she cannot dry her tears For her dear departed mate. FATHER. Sev'n years! prepost'rous! speak again. MATRON. Well, let him wait a twelve-month then. MAID. The time is somewhat shorten'd, Sir. FATHER. But still too long. MATRON. Well, half a year. CENTURION. Too long by half. MATRON. A month then, pray. FATHER. Daughter, you shall be his to-day. MATRON. To-day! FATHER. To-day. MATRON. Nay, pray, Sir, pray, Admit a decent time for sorrow; To day I vow, I cant allowâ It must not beâbefore to-morrow. AIR AND CHORUS. Father. Thus, old wits, in wicked satires, Formerly the fair malign'd; Call'd them light, vain, false, affected, And unsteady as the wind. If they copy'd after nature, Bless'd are English dames I trow, So much alter'd from what ladies Were two thousand years ago. Matron. False and mean the accusation. Men our sex unjustly blame; They are slaves to little passions, And would brand us with the same. Struck with native imperfection, As their minds the object sours; From themselves they draw a picture, Then cry out the face is ours. Maid. Says a traveller to a lion, Upon yonder sign-post see, How a lion like your worship's Torn by a man like me. Says the lion to the traveller, 'Twas a man the daubing drew; Had a lion been the painter, I had been a tearing you. Centu. No excuses, nor allusions: Here's the burden of my song; Women sovereigns are of nature, And as such can ne'er be wrong. Sent to rule, to bless, to charm us, Spite of wit, in rancour's spite, Ev'ry thing they say is proper, Ev'ry thing they do is right. FINIS.</field>
