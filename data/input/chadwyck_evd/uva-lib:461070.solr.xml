      <field name="fulltext">HANNIBAL: A Drama. IN TWO PARTS. PART II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âThe Capitol of Rome. The Senate assembled there. Fabius, Nero, Fulvius, &amp;c. Enter Scipio, as Consul. Fab. Young man, a noble destiny is thine. Thou hast outstripped thine elders in the race, And standest here, thy country's chosen hope. Well has Spain trained thee, well dost thou deserve That Italy should want thee. Prosper there! Say, then, what scheme of warfare hast thou framed? What province for his arms does Scipio ask? Scip. I ask for Africa. Nero. Thou art mad, Scipio! Scip. If I am mad, a madman must save Rome; For 'tis my fixed intent to fight the foe At his own gates. A Sen. O monstrous arrogance! Is this the wisdom, then, whereto our country Her safety has committed! Another. O strange times! When such boy's fancies are put gravely forth, As means of Rome's deliverance, by Rome's consul! Fab. Scipio, comes this resolve of hasty rashness, Or hast thou well considered what thou say'st? We have fixed on thee to cope with Hannibal, Who, though his field of warfare be much narrowed Since the good day that cut off Hasdrubal, Still nourishes his armies on our soil, And now is waiting with a hope revived, For his last brother, for the desperate Mago. This being so, why should thy fancy fly Across the sea to Carthage? Send him thither; Then follow if thou wilt. But wait till then. Scip. I cannot send him hence, whilst I stay here; That has been tried for fifteen years in vain. But let me cross the seas, and I will call him With such a voice he shall not fail to hear. I have well thought this over, and perceive This is the path now plainly traced before me. Fab. Thou art elate with easier victories Than this shall be, which thou art dreaming of. 'Tis true thou wert a match for Hasdrubal; 'Tis true that thou hast conquered Spain for us; And now we have no Hasdrubal to fear. There lies heâthanks to Nero and to Liviusâ Lord of a few feet of Italian earth. But Hannibal is ever Hannibal, And gazes still with the fixed eyes of hate, On that small spot of earth where Rome still stands. That spot those eyeballs never will forego, Whilst his heart beats and hope is named on earth. No chance we offer will he fail to note And turn to his own profit. Mago, tooâ Again, I say, forgett'st thou Mago's host, Now on the watch to enter Italy, For whom, perchance, no new Metaurus waits? Thus, wert thou absent on a perilous errand, With soldiers far more needed nearer home, Thou wouldst be tempting Hannibal to try His fortune once again. A second spring, And Rome might be his prey. Nero. Wilt thou lure back False Syphax to us, Scipio? Wilt thou find Another and more potent Sophonisba? Scip. That costly bride, whose smiles may count for kingdoms, Has stolen one king from us, our sworn ally, But she has given a better in his place; For Masanissa's soul belongs to Rome. I grant that he is kingdomless as yetâ Syphax has seized his realmâbut yet himself, As ye shall find, will be a very host. Soon as we land, his eager tribe will flock To join his standard, and I nothing doubt That he will ride beside us at the head Of the best horsemen that tread Afric's sands. His is a loftier genius than his rival's, A greater prize his friendship. I have fought In battle with him, and in friendly talk Have met him face to face. I know him well. With Masanissa on my side I take This venture on me. Think of Regulus; How easily, once landed, he o'erran The fair and fruitful region wherein stands The single Carthage; not a fortress there To bar our progress; houses, gardens, vines, Corn-fields, where now toil many a Roman slave, Invite us to approach. Remember, too, How harsh and hated is th'imperial rule Of Carthage, by her tributaries round. Small is the help that she will win from them. Therefore, I say, let me be turned loose there, And I will find soon, for Hamilcar's sonsâ Ay, both of them, and not for Mago onlyâ Some work to do a little nearer home. Fab. Be not too proud; be not too sure. Scip. I am not. You think me rash and boastful; so, perhaps, The men of Carthage thought their Hannibal, When first he spoke of storming the great Alps. No great deed yet was planned, but they who most Should profit by th'accomplishment thereof, Trembled beforehand at its very greatness. Fathers, again I ask for Africa; Fathers, deny me not this thing I ask, Or else take back the name of consul from me, And let me send my sword home to its sheath. Fulv. Must this rash youth prevail in his mad wish? Shall our grave judgments count as nought with you? Must you be wiser than so many elder? You spoke of Regulus. Beware lest pride, Forewarned in vain, meet with a fall like his! Scip. Then, Fathers, to the people I appeal! Nero. Scipio, for shame, do thou leave this to us. Scip. One day I leave you to consider of it, And that day being past, let it be seen Which shall decide hereinâyou, or the people. Fab. So be it. May that day bestow you wisdom. Sen. [speaking to each other.] He has gained his point; be sure that threat suffices. [The Senate breaks up.] Scene II. âA mountain pass on the Bruttian frontier. Corpses of Roman soldiers scattered here and there. Enter Hannibal and Maharbal, riding. Mah. Fools! they forget that here we are at home. Pray Heaven, they pardon us for shutting to The door of Bruttium in their face so rudely! Han. Along this pass I saw young Zeba dash, Singly, in hot pursuit of some who spurred Their horses toward yon glimpse of sun and sky. If back he comes at all, he comes to bring Some trophy of his daring. Mah. Hark, his shout! Enter Zeba, on horseback. And here he comes in triumph, brandishing His spear, that's red with many a Roman life. Zeba. My lord! My lord! I have fulfilled my vow! Behold thy vengeance. [Dismounting.] Here lies Nero's son, Dog, of a breed accurst!âdisherited Of his forefathers' tomb! May the four winds Scatter its ashes! Han. Let me look upon him. [Dismounts.] Mah. Thou art a very noble fellow, Zeba! And, if I live, I'll give my daughter to thee. Han. Why should I triumph o'er thee, slaughtered boy? Thou art not Romeânor canst, with all thy blood, Discharge his debt, whose debt to me is Rome's, And must be claimed from her. Such vengeances, What are they, but salt mimicries of water Across the endless desert of my loss? Mah. I looked to see thee smile. Han. Let Zeba smile, For he is happy in a vow fulfilled. Zeba, I say, well done! Ride thou beside me, And tell me how thou brought'st this stag to bay. Zeba. When thou didst honour to Rome's slaughtered consuls, I think she mocked thee. Let the fowls of the air Possess this corpse, and tear the senseless heart With beak and talons ravenous as my hate! Mah. With beak and talons not more butcherly Than Nero's tender mercies to the dead! Han. Yet do I bid thee cover him with earth. Let not these creatures foul profane the dust That's consecrated by a brave revenge.â On to Crotona now! I have a work To dedicate to rock-throned Juno there. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âAfrica. Scipio's Camp at Utica. Scipio, LÃ¦lius, and others, returning from battle, enter the tent of the former. LÃ¦l. Io triumphe! Laud we all the gods!â Here are red swords!âScipio, your work's half done. I dare be sworn, the game you have played to-day Shall blow so loud a trumpet o'er the sea, As Hannibal himself shall start to hear. Three calls you have sent him, and the last will bring him. Scip. My friends, I give you, one and all, my thanks.â Let us sit down, and, whilst our bodies rest, Our minds shall not be idle. Therefore hear My present purposes. Hasdrubal-Gisco May carry his disgraces where he will,â I think we shall not see his face again; But, for his partner in ill-luck, King Syphax, LÃ¦lius, it falls to you and Masanissa To chase him to his capital. By dawn I'd have you mount again, nor spare the spur Till you have reached Massylia. Masanissa Must get his kingdom back; which being done, Press after Syphax. I shall look to have A garrison in Cirtha, and its lord Alive or dead. For my own private pleasure, I could desire he might be saved alive For my hereafter Triumph. But remember, Whether he live or die, I enter not Rome without Sophonisba. Give the land A taste of fire and sword, from end to end, Then back to me. This, LÃ¦lius, is your part. Myself will on to Tunes, and, whilst you Are busy with Numidia, make short work Among the towns of Carthage. I conceive Your voices will be all for me in this? All. Ay, Scipio, we have but one mind amongst us! LÃ¦l. There's one that's absent I will answer for. I know where Masanissa's heart is now, And think that he will mount at dawn to-morrow To ride a joyful race. Scip. Let him not think To win again that dangerous bride of his. She made a traitor of our old ally, And she may make one of the new friend too. Enough for him to get his kingdom back, And add his rival's kingdom to his own; His rival's queen is destined to my triumph. Let him know this; precede him, if thou canst, In Cirtha, and at once secure the prize. LÃ¦l. What, I must teach him Rome claims all his heart, And will not brook e'en woman's rivalship? Well, I will preach my best. Scip. My friends, good night. [Exeunt LÃ¦lius, &amp;c. Scene II. âCirtha. A hall in the palace of Syphax. Micipsa, Juba, Mastanabal, and other Numidian Chiefs assembled. Enter Sophonisba. All the Chiefs. Behold thy slaves! We kiss the dust before thee! Soph. Micipsa, Juba, and Mastanabal! My husband's loved and trusted from of old! Conquered and captive as he is, alas! It may be he will ne'er return to thank you For all your faithfulness to him and me, Who seem to stand this day on ruin's brink; Yet well I know that you will never suffer, Whilst there are hearts and hands to follow you, Such as these matchless ones I see before me, His city and his queen to be the spoil Of Masanissa's spear. Micip. No! by the rocks Our fathers' graves are carved in, we will shed, O Queen of Syphax! our last drop of blood Ere have such shame to blush for. Juba. Light of Cirtha! Ampsaga's waters shall run red that day With the best blood of Masanissa's tribe, Ere here he stand our master! Mast. When thou hear'st The trampling of his horsemen in the land, Then from thy towers look down, daughter of Carthage, And see if these thy servants keep their oath. Soph. Warriors and friends, I thank you and believe you! Nor think that I to Syphax will be wanting, If the dark hour befall us. You shall never Blush in your graves for me. Farewell! farewell! All. Farewell, O queen! We haste to die for thee. [Exeunt omnes. Scene III. âA splendid apartment in the same palace. Sophonisba surrounded by her women. Enter a Messenger, hastily. Mess. O Queen! Micipsa on the walls hath fallen! Soph. May the gods take his glorious soul to rest! Our warriors do not yield? Mess. They and the chiefs Still fight like genii, more than mortal men. Soph. May they come back for me to thank them!âCourage, Daughters of Cirtha! Let us never shame The hearts that die for us! Enter another Messenger. Mess. Woe! woe! great queen! Juba is slain! The enemy bursts on, In still increasing numbersâand ours fall, One after one, around Mastanabal. Soph. Oh, happier they that die than they that live!â Once more, my friends, take courage! Let them find us, Not with dishevelled locks, and tears, and outcries, Defenceless though we be, courting their pityâ But ready each, with steadfast souls, for fate.â Nay, your hands trembleâI will braid my hair. One of the Women. Alas, dear mistress, pardon! Let our hands, For the last time, in robes of royalty Array our queen. Soph. I thank you, O my friends! Another. O queen, and what shall be our fate? Soph. Poor child, I know not! Yet we all would rather perish, Would we not so, than live in Roman bondage? Another. O mistress, 'tis for thee, too, that we weep. To think that such a beautiful young queen Should come to such a fate! Soph. Weep not for me, Weep for my captive husband, and the brave That will return no more. [Cries and confusion are heard in the streets below. A wounded Soldier rushes in.] Sold. O queen! O queen! Mastanabal is fallen!âThe gates are burst!â The enemy is pouring through the town!â Hark! hark! They are here already! Hear you not Those galloping horse-hoofs? 'Tis the king himself. [Shrieks and tumult heard in the palace.] Wom. O ye gods!â Do you hear?âDo you hear?âThat rush upon the stair! Enter Masanissa. Mas. Ha, Sophonisba! Soph. Masanissa! Mas. Oh, False bride, this is the triumph of my life! Soph. Where is my husband? Mas. He? What's that to me? He stole thee from me, but I have thee back! Captive, or dead, you'll never see him more! Who wants him, think you, now? Will he save Carthage? Soph. Thou mayst insult me, for I stand defenceless. Mas. Insult thee! Oh, no, no! I come to save thee, And, praised be all the gods, I am in time. I have outstripped the Romans in the race, And now let LÃ¦lius claim thee if he will! But I have not a moment's space to loseâ I must away to Scipio's camp again, Ere nightfall, and must marry thee to-day. Soph. Marry me, Masanissa! Mas. I have said it! For thine own safety I must marry theeâ Soph. 'Tis worthy of thee thus to mock me. Mas. Hush! Wed me thou must and shalt! But time is short, And danger pressesâI must make thee mine, With such brief martial pomp as time allows; Then back to Scipio,âbut I first must wed thee. Soph. Thou wed me, Masanissa! Never! Never! Mas. Give me no more that answer, Sophonisba! I loved thee from a boy! Soph. And, when a man, Thou didst forsake me. Mas. Thou wert faithless first! But come, thine answer! Wilt thou marry me? Soph. Thou hast mine answerânever! Mas. By the gods, Why dost thou turn from me so scornfully?â Go, then, and pace Rome-streets in chains, I say! Go, walk before the chariot-wheels of Scipio! For, by my soul, I swear I cannot save thee From Scipio's Triumph, if thou wilt not wed me! LÃ¦lius is here to claim theeâgo with him! Ha, how thou look'st! Wom. [rushing up.] The queen! the queen has fainted! Mas. My love! my love! my bride! look up and live! Soph. Oh, I have borne much! Silently my heart Has broken for my country, and my loveâ But this I will not bear, this is too much! O Masanissa, see to what thou hast brought The creature thou didst love! Kill me at once, For I am sickened at the light of day. Mas. Hush! hush! Thou driv'st me mad!âOh, stop those tears!â She weeps as she would never cease from weeping. Soph. If thou hast a man's heart, let not the hands Of Roman soldiers, drunken with the blood Of those that died for Carthage and for me, Profane the form of her that was thy bride, Dragging me through the jeering crowds of Rome Before those hateful wheels! O Masanissa! Let not this cheek, which never yet hath met The gaze of Africa's own skies unveiled, Be scorched with blushes by the eyes of thousands, The eyes of menâof enemiesâof Romans! Mas. No more! no more! Gods! Dost thou think I will Let any Roman touch a hair of thine? Soph. Let me sit here. I shall not faint again. Now look me in the face, and answer me. Canst thou indeed, proud, self-willed as thou artâ Canst thou indeed not save meâme thy loveâ From Roman bondage, if I will not wed thee? Thou dar'st not, or thou wilt not, say thou canst, Was it for this, thou left'st me in the bloom Of girlhood, hope, and love? Was this the visionâ When in the glorious idleness of youth, We loved to tell our daydreams to each otherâ Was this the secret vision of thy soul? Didst thou behold me then a slave in chains, Bowed with the shame of Carthage and my own, From street to street at my new masters' bidding Walk, in broad daylight, slowly, step by step, In time to those relentless wheels behind, Through two long human walls windowed with eyes That watch how oft my unaccustomed feet On the rough pavement stumble, till at last From the long agony they lead me back To thank thee in my prison for that hour, And count how many years of life are left, To take a slave's bread from the hands of Rome? Mas. How dar'st thou stab my soul so, Sophonisba? I will not bear it! Soph. Yet I swear to thee, That I will never wed theeâno, nor yet Walk before Scipio's chariot. I must die. Mas. Oh, madness, Sophonisba! merely madness! What obstinate demon rules thy spirit? Soph. Hush!â I married Syphax for my country's sakeâ Nobly he did his part by her! Three times He gathered up his nation's utmost strength, To battle for her by my father's side, And when, though vanquished, by a prompt submission He might have saved his kingdom and himself, Urged by my prayers and tears, still shared his fate. And shall I now forsake this faithful friend, In his own hall marry his conquering rival, Triumph with him o'er Carthage, pray with him For Rome's success? Now, even nowâere yet The heroic corpses thou didst trample o'er To reach my gates, are cold? No, never! never! Thou canst not force me to it. Hear me out! Mas. Must I hear this? I'll tear him limb from limb! Soph. Be calm; for I have taken my resolve. Cirtha is now thy city. Thou alone Canst save these helpless creatures, and thou wilt. Be just, be generous, be merciful To thy fallen rival's peopleâand to him! Mas. Oh, yet take pity on thyself and me! Let love be love! Why should the roar of war, The wranglings and the rivalries of States, Be heard within that green palm-shade of bliss I'll keep fresh for thee in this world's hot desert! Life is so beautiful, my Sophonisba! Love is so mighty! E'en when most I thought Ambition to the austere smiles of Rome Had given my heart, I loved thee to its core. And now to lose theeâno, 'tis death to dream it! [He paces the room once, then returns to her.] It must be now decided! LÃ¦lius thereâ I here! This is the only moment left! How shall I move thy soul's strange stoniness, That seems the cold creation of a dream? Break through the charm, and come to life again, Thou cruel phantom! Oh, for one short moment, Think of me once again, as once I was! Let us for once again be boy and girl, Deep in the fond familiar talk of old, And then thy heart shall melt to me once more, And thou in thy true home within these arms Be, not Rome's slave, but Masanissa's queen! Soph. I have a better refuge. Hark, that noise! Mas. Ha, 'tis the Roman trumpets! [The gallop of cavalry heard below. He rushes to the window.] LÃ¦lius is come! Fear not! fear not! He shall not set foot here. [Exit. One of the Women. See, see! One reins his horse up at the gates, And glances upwards with his eagle eyes. That must be LÃ¦lius! Another. And King Masanissaâ See how he rushes forth to meet him! Another. Hearken!â O Ashtaroth! How angry are their voices! How stern the Roman looks! how fierce the king! Others. [surrounding Sophonisba.] O mistress, mistress! Do not die and leave us! Soph. Kind friends, I shall not leave you unprotected, For Masanissa will take pity on you. Now grant my last requestâgive me one moment Of silence to remember my past life, And love me when I'm gone. [She swallows poison.] Re-enter Masanissa. Mas. Thou'rt safe from LÃ¦lius, Safe for the moment, butâ Soph. Yes, safe for ever. Mas. What's this? What mean'st thou? Soph. I have taken poison. Mas. It is a lie! a lie! Not even thou Wouldst plunge in such a hell the man that loves thee! How dar'st thou say so? Soph. I have spoken truth. Oh, yet be calmâthou hast much to live for still. Thy course is but begun, whilst mine is over. Mas. Inhuman heart! Revel in my despair! O Sophonisba, thou didst never love me! Soph. I always loved thee. Mas. Oh, to hear this now, When it is only torture! Nothing left me, Save to sum up th'irrevocable past In this last bitter kiss!âHave I no words, My dying love! to tell thee how I love thee, And groan for thy dear pardon? Soph. Masanissa! Forget not my last prayer; protect all these. Mas. Whatever thou hast loved be dear to me As my own soul! Soph. And Syphaxâsave his life. Mas. Curse him!âmy rival to the very last! Soph. Give me thy promise. Mas. Yes, he shall be saved. Soph. Now will I think of thee as once thou wert! Now let us once again be boy and girl; All be forgotten but this blissful now! I love thee, pity thee, and pardon thee. Mas. Oh, but my future! Cruel, cruel love! Thou hast curst my life. Soph. Ah no, be happy still! I could not live. True to my love I die, And yet not false to Carthage, nor my fame. [Dies. All the women raise loud cries of grief.] Wom. Our queen! our queen!âour hearts' beloved queen! How shall we live without her! Mas. Silence!âOh, Love, brand this cruel picture on my soul, In one brief moment for a whole life's torture! O head thrown backward in a queenly sleep! O lips half loosened from their bitter curve! O brow that scorned me, half unbent with pity! O heart that loved me, cold to me for ever! O marble, senseless to despair's last kiss! Lost, murdered, matchless loveliness, farewell!â Take her! I'll never look upon her more. [Rushes out.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âCrotona. A public banqueting-hall. Citizens assembled, drinking after the banquet. Hannibal, Maharbal, Adherbal, and other Carthaginians, as guests of the Greek Citizens, the Master of the Feast presiding. Mast. of the Feast. O Hannibal, yet one more health we owe thee, Ere for the longed-for lyre we hush the board, And with sweet songs delay the brimming cup. Proud is Crotona that her temple adds To priceless stores from countless votaries The sacred story of a hero's deeds, Told as a hero tells them! Thou hast told them; Others must praise them. Proud are we to think How oft the pious thousands of the towns That honour Juno, when they hither crowd To celebrate her day of awful pomp, Shall on thy dedicated column read, In thine own words, the wonders of thy life; And more shall read than yet is graven there, For fiery letters in the dark I see, Wherein thy last achievement shall be writ. I drink to the next record on thy column! Han. Receive my thanks. Whatever record stands, Come ruin, or come triumph, 'gainst my name, Be it a true one, I desire no better. But were my deeds all even that you say, May Juno's temple and Crotona long Outlive their fame, and greater fames than mine! I drink to the great goddess. All. Hail to her! Mah. [Aside.] Their wine is good; but for their chatter! oh, Pray heaven 'tis the last time I ever sit At a Greek supper-table! Ha, the lyre! Now for a love-song, for Adherbal's smiling His sweetest o'er that jingling toy he dotes on. Adh. [Sings.] O maiden, with hand on the mane Of thy bridleless barb, tell me why So breathless to bound o'er the plain, And vanish away in the sky? Thou whom I haste from the city to see, Wild Grace of the desert, why fly'st thou from me? O maid of the city, the rose Of one cheek on thy cushion is hid, And drowned in the tempest which flows From under a sable-lashed lid! Thou whom I haste from the desert to see, Why weep'st thou, O beauty, and weep'st not for me? Oh, standing superb in the shine Of thy tresses' Olympian gold! Whose snowy white garments divine, A terrible beauty enfold! Forgotten are desert and city for thee, O goddess, who smilest, and smilest on me! Mah. That voice cloys me like honey. He a soldier!â Could Rome be won by singing!â Han. Pardon him, For that sweet voice in noisy battle still Outrings the trumpet with its silver cry. [Adherbal passes the lyre to a Citizen.] Cit. Deign, Hannibal, to choose a theme for me. Han. Pray thee, a lay from Homer. Cit. Willingly. Say, what strain shall I choose? Han. Sing Hector's slaughter, And the lament of Troy around his corpse. [The Citizen sings.] Enter Silanus, and seats himself by Hannibal. Mast. of the Feast. Welcome, Silanus! Thou hast missed our supper, But if thou com'st to share the wine-cup with us, Thou art not yet too late. Sil. Thanks, it sufficeth. [To Hannibal.] In the cool colonnade I looked to find thee, According to thy wont. To-day it seems Thou scorn'st not the symposium. Han. As thou say'st. Whence com'st thou? Sil. From Lacinium. I have spent The supper-hour in studying on thy column The battles, sieges, marches, dates and numbers, Drily inscribed there, as the trader notes His bargains on his tablets. When I first At thy dictation penned the list of them, I had no time to reckon up the sum. To-day I have done so. Han. And what sayst thou, then? Find'st thou that column an authentic record? Sil. I think it is the sole authentic one Thy deeds are like to have in after-times; Unless, indeed, I finish ere I die The narrative I mean to give the world. Mah. Thou write a history of war, forsooth! Thou man of peace! A pretty tale thou'lt make. Han. I'll trust Silanus; but forbid it, Clio, My fame be forced to beg its bread from Rome! My ghost would scarcely know myself so handled. A monster, first, of cruelty, and next, A blunderer after CannÃ¦. Then for Capuaâ The luxury we all did live in there! What a pet theme for moralists! Besides, Did I not lose an eye this side the Alps? Sil. Thy strange disguises in Cisalpine Gaul Must bear, I think, the credit of that story.â I wonder oft with what a simple faith We read the pretty stories of old authors, Who know how gossip deals with us that live; And how we think we understand men's motives, And are as much at home in minds that lived Some hundred years ago as in our own, Which yet our nearest understand not. Han. Nor, Perchance, ourselves much better. Mah. The gods save us! How thou wilt make thy personages talk! I pray put no fine speeches in my mouth! Plain sense for me! I'd start out of my grave, If any man should think I prosed in Greek. Sil. Fear notâI shall deal tenderly with thee. I'll tell posterity that thou couldst ride As well as a Numidianâcouldst much better ManÅuvre cavalry for Hannibal, Than comprehend an epicâand, moreover, I'll say thou wert an early riserâhadst A head most potent wine could never vanquishâ Wert punctual to appointments, also wont To curse and swear at every man that was not, And never couldst be brought to understand Why any woman should be taught to read. Will this content thee? Mah. Have it thine own wayâ Be sure I'll never read a page of it. Sil. [to Hannibal.] Thou art not in the spirit present here. Where art thou, then? Han. In Carthage. Sil. There? Methinks Thy spirit must behold her through a mist, Left in such early childhood. Canst thou still Feel it thy home? Han. As it so chanced, last night I dreamed of Carthage, and was there, I think, As verily as if my soul had been Rapt from my sleeping body, and borne thither. The vivid vision is all round me now. Sil. Would I could see it too! Paint it for me. Han. Strange, how the scenes beheld in childhood last, With all the slight details in waking hours Forgotten, stood out in sharp colouring! There, in their threefold ring of walls and towers, With here and there a straight black cypress-spire, Or plumy palm-top, pointing to the sky, Lay all the shining crowd of its white houses, Marching, as 'twere, into the smooth, bright sea, And wound in its blue girdle; bounding all, The spacious outer harbour, galley-thronged; The Kothon's mighty quays more deep withinâ Its thick-set fringe of masts, like lifted spears, Glimpsed through its white Ionic colonnade; Then, high above, the Bozra's stately steep Rising through terraced streets to the vast stair Of Esmun's Temple, the whole city's crown; And all the garden-suburb of Magaliaâ A walled-in paradise with its green shrine Of orange groves and lightly-feathering trees, O'er breadths of glittering water strewn in isles. There was I standing in the streets again: I saw the loaded elephants, I heard The cries of them that drove the strings of mules, And through the gates watched the long trains stream in Of sable slaves from the far savage south. My father's palace I beheld once more, 'Neath whose broad archway, to and fro, so oft The brothers of my childhood have passed with me. Then, with a sudden flitting of the scene, O'er miles of corn and olive, trellised vines, And mantling fig-tree foliage, I was borne To his Byzacean mansion, dark and cool, In cedar-shade, and labyrinths of rose. Sil. Were I a cunning soothsayer, I would tell thee This vision did portend thy swift return, Loaded, of course, with laurels, and so forth. There's still room for the story on thy column. Han. Ill did the shade of solemn sadness thrownâ As 'twere a haze across the spendid sunâ Over the scene I saw, that flattery suit. I am content to have seen my city thus. Nought but calamity can call me home. Enter a Messenger. Mess. My lord, a ship from Carthage is in port, Whose captain brings you letters. He is here, And waits to place them in your hands. Han. Admit him. Enter Carthaginian Captain, and salutes the assembly. He presents his letters to Hannibal. Mast. of the Feast. Gladly, O stranger, to our board we welcome Hannibal's countryman. I pray you sit. Han. [starting from his seat]. Traitors and cowards! The fires of hell devour them! Shame blast their names to all eternity! [Re-seats himself.] Pardon me, friends, I interrupt your revel; Heed not, I pray, my rudeness. Sil. [aside to him]. Have a care! Men's hearts break with such efforts. Han. I am well. Sil. Thy face is stony, but thou art not well; Whate'er thy secret be, hide not too long The inward pang that rends thee. Han. I can bear it. A Cit. [to another]. What follows next? I thought some god had doomed us, And this was but a banquet of dead men! Another. What thunderbolt from Afric has been hurled, To set that swarthy darkness in a blaze? Another. This comes when mighty conquerors deign to sup With peaceful citizens! Another. His generals Roll their fierce eyes on him with gloomy wonder; The stranger captain sits in a stern silence. [To Maharbal.] I trust our city, sir, is not in danger? Methought that Rome was at our very gates! Mah. Plague take your foolish city! You are safe As Punic shields can keep you! A Cit. [aside]. He may say so, Yet non the less the revel has grown tasteless. Mast. of the Feast. Friends, have we drained enough of cups to-night? Let us depart, I pray you. [All rise together. The Greek guests disperse hastily; the Carthaginians gather round Hannibal.] Mah. Ay, hence with you. Han. O my unsatisfied revenge! that hast Haunted me like a beggar for so long, Be patient, for thy waiting is not done! Yet, thou stern ghost, no pardon do I ask Of thy beheaded form, and all the wounds Which made a ruin of thy mortal house, Because that Tiber runs not yet with blood, Because that Rome is not yet changed to flames! I ask no pardon, for thou sitt'st so close To the most secret counsels of my heart, Dead though thou art, thou still art one with me, As ever in those days, when the great dread Of thee walked living over Italy! Adh. O Hannibal, awake from this dire trance, And let us share thine agony with thee! Han. A second time the fool of Roman gods, A second time the plaything of their scorn! They jest upon me, Hasdrubal, my brother!â Comrades, I am recalled. Adh. Recalled!âThou? Whither? Han. Recalled to Africa. Scipio has thrice Routed the Son of Gisco, and King Syphax; Cirtha is taken, and Syphax is a prisoner; Carthage is threatened, and will fall, unless I am in time to save her. Adh. Are we dreaming? Han. Scipio has now my place. Long have I borne In patience the slow death of my heart's hope, And well I might have guessed that this would beâ Yet scarcely thought so to revisit Carthage. Mah. Accursed news! Adh. This is the heaviest blow Save one, thou hast been called to bear and live! Mah. Thou yet shalt march on Rome. Han. Never again. Yet here I would have lingered till old age, So her deep wounds might bleed at last to death.â Read here, tooâlittle may we doubt that Scipio Holds for the foremost trophy of his triumph A Carthaginian's daughter and a queen. I think Rome will enjoy her holiday! Adh. Unless we spoil it for her. Han. Knowing this, You'll further look to hear my brother Mago, Like me, has been recalled. Mah. That's easy guessed. Han. In truth this does not take me by surprise. Sooner or later 'twas inevitable, If Mago's desperate effort in Liguriaâ Our last hopeâfailed; but Mago has done nobly, And bringing me himself, brings me a host. Mah. Now shalt thou meet him the first time since CannÃ¦. Let Rome look to it when you come together. Han. Back to my quarters nowâno time to lose. [To the Captain.] Come with me, sir, and let me hear from you What further you are charged with from the State. [Exeunt omnes. Scene II. âA House in Crotona. Hannibal and Adherbal, and Citizens. Han. I have said it. You are welcome to my ships, Both you and yours; and on the soil of Afric Shall find a home and refuge from Rome's rage, As long as Afric is a home for me. For those who choose submission to their fate, I trust there may e'en yet be clemency. I grieve to leave themâleave, but not forgetâ And if I can, will break their yoke once more. Cit. O Hannibal, our mournful thanks we owe thee! To leave our home is hard, yet not so hard, Following the fortunes of thine undimmed star, Trusting to which we look for our return. [Exeunt. Enter an Officer hastily. Off. My lord! my lord! Th'Italian troops are all Crowding to Juno's temple, where, drawn up, They vow they will not go to Africa. They heed us notâthey call upon the goddess, And drown our words in outcries of defiance. Han. They'll go where I will, or to Tartarus.â Thoas! my horse! Adh. Let me call out my Spaniards, And if these fellows come not to their duty, We'll show Lacinian Juno on her throne How red's the blood of traitors. We can face, I think, her clamours at the sacrilege. Han. 'Twill not be needed. Ne'ertheless be ready; For if they come not willingly, I'll show them Stern reasons for obedience. If those fail I leave to Rome their corpses; but, meanwhile, I want them living, and will have them, too. Enter Silanus. Sil. I break in on stern moments, I divine. Adherbal, by that soft, persuasive smile, And tones as soft, is counselling rough deeds; So doubtless, too, that delicate pen of his, Which traces war-despatches like love-letters. Yet pardon this intrusion, Hannibal! This is the hour thou bad'st me come to thee. Han. Yet must I keep thee waiting, for a space, Whilst first I gallop to Lacinium. Adh. I, Meanwhile, will have my men in readiness, To fall upon these mutineers. Han. So do. I shall not need thee. [Exit. Adh. Thou, if time hang heavy, Mayst spend it in composing funeral dirges. Sil. Willingly. But for whom? Adh. For Mago, first. Sil. For Mago? Art thou such a gloomy prophet? Adh. News of his death this morn have reached his brother. Sil. Is this no jest? Dead? Adh. Of his wounds in battle. The summons home found him, it seems, defeated In one last struggle to cut through his way 'Gainst overwhelming numbers to Etruria, And with a death-wound on himânot, indeed, Defeated till that death-wound. Yet did he Haste, like a true son of Hamilcar's blood, To obey the call, all dying as he was, Embarked with all his army, and expired In passing the Sardinian shore, worn out By the fierce fever of his mind and body. Sil. And Hannibal has now no brother. Adh. None! Such is the comfort that to-day has brought him; To-morrow may bring comfort of its own. The other news we have may be called good. The noble Sophonisba had drunk poison, Rather than fall into the hands of Scipio, And shame her country and her royalty, Her father's house and every house in Carthage, By living for his triumph. Mago's ghost Will find her gone before him. Sil. Well, the skies Can rain disaster on no soul and heart More strong to bear themâyet on none, perchance, More strong to feel them. What shall follow next? Adh. The times are changed. This day, nine years ago, We left our fires red on Tifata's heights, And swept along the Latin road, to Rome. Sil. I had forgotten. Adh. They will not forget! Long shall the husbandmen of Cales tell, Around the purple winepress, how our swarms Burst on her vines when all the leaves were green, And left nor green leaf nor a blossom there! Long shall Casinum for her olives mourn! Long shall FregellÃ¦ curse the day when first Our vengeful trumpets sounded in her lands, And silent Liris tremble down the vale, Remembering how he rolled that day through flames! E'en from the loftiest peak of Algidusâ On whose black oaks the burden of his snows Round Dian's freezing temple lay so lateâ Long the pale priestess in her dreams shall hear The echoes of our horsehoofs thundering by!â Yet Capua fell, and on Tifata's heights Ne'er have our fires been seen to burn again! Small comfort in such anniversaries! I must begone! Adieu! [Exit. Sil. Proud soldier-souls, Hard is the lesson you are now to learn, Nor gentle the task-masters that shall teach it. Under his novel schooling, Mago died. Scene III. The Temple of Juno on the promontory of Lacinium, surrounded by groves and pastures. The Italian troops gathered in and around it. Enter Maharbal. Mah. What! what! You will not! Oh, you pitiful turncoats! Dogs! Scoundrels! all of you! You will not, then? Ital. We have had war enough! For fifteen years, There has been no peace in Italy for him! We will not follow him to Africaâ We will not go and perish in the desert! Mah. I'd like to see you say this to his face! So this is all the thanks he gets from you For making soldiers of you, giving you So many victories over your enemies! Ital. We will not leave this landâwe swear we will not! Mah. A pretty pack of cowards are you all! You fear salt water, do you? By my life! I'll throw you every man into the sea. Ha! horse-hoofs that methinks I know the sound of! Enter Hannibal. Han. What's this, Italians? What's this mutiny? Ital. O Hannibal, take us not o'er the seas! Han. Peace! Let me never hear those words again, And I'll forget that you have uttered them! Where'er I go, you'll follow. Ital. Oh, thou know'st us! Remain in Italy, and we're thy slaves! Han. I have trained you like my children, you Italians! I have been proud to win my victories with you, I know you better than you know yourselves, And I'll not yet believe you are no braver Than frightened girls that weep to leave their mothers! Ital. Try us! oh, try us! Lead us to Rome's gates, And we will burst them for thee! Han. Not to Rome I choose to lead you, but to AfricâWhat! You think, when I am gone, you'll stay at home, To eat and drink, and boast of your old fights, Whilst o'er the seas, Scipio and I are locked In the death grapple? And when I come back, Conqueror without your help, you'll wish me joy? Ay, hang your heads, lest I should see you blush! You will not cross the seas to Afric? Nay, But your new masters wait to lash you thither, Whine and crouch as you will. I'll meet you thenâ Meet my old soldiers, but no longer mineâ No more your general, but with levelled spears! Ital. We'll perish first! Curst be the man of us That dreams of fighting 'neath a Roman banner! Dost thou not know thou break'st our hearts to say so? Han. Come, then, with me! Make not my triumph sad, Won without you! We are so knit together, The gods themselves dare not to part us. Come! Help me to win the noblest of my battles! Help me to save my Carthage! One more victory, Then home! yes, home to happy Italy! Ital. We go! we go!âWe follow thee to death!â Forgive us, oh, forgive us!âWe were mad! Take us! still take us!âWe are thine for ever! Han. Oh, now I know again my brave Italians! The old voice, the old look, and the old love! Who says we shall not stand or fall together? Let Juno ratify our new betrothment, And witness your true vows! Ital. We swear by Juno! May Juno strike us dead, if now we fail thee! [The Italian troops march out of the Temple.] Han. They have done well; for death was at the doorâ Had they stood outâin a more human shape. Mah. I would have done the business with a will! Han. So Mago's work is done, and he is gone! None left to mourn me, as I mourn for him. [Exit. Scene IV. âThe sea-shore. A crowd collected waiting for Hannibal's embarcation. Herdoneans and Metapontines mixed with the people of Crotona. A Cit. Ay, let the women wail! 'Tis time indeed! Who will protect us now? Anoth. Yes, there they go! Gaul, Spaniard, Africanâeach in their turn, The blue-eyed and the swarthyâone fierce face After another. Pass one little hour, And this land will have seen its last of them! Anoth. A swarm of hornets seeking a new nest! And ne'er a Roman dares but raise a shout To send them quicker. Anoth. Pale, sad faces here! We seem to wait an earthquake! Well, no wonder! What shall our fate be now? As yet the Roman Cares not to show so much as a spear's point. They let him go in peace, but once he's gone, Down come they with a vengeance! Anoth. Mighty Juno! He leaves us worse off than we were before! He should have never come, or never gone. A Herd. Let him go, the black-hearted Carthaginian! And let the curses of the slain go with him! Anoth. Herd. And let the curses of our ruined cities Shake his own Carthage deep as her foundations! A Metap. You'll all live to regret him. Greater man Never did this land see, nor ever shallâ A man more dreadful to his enemies, More generous, just, and faithful to his friends, Yea, to the humblest of them. A Cit. If he beats Young Scipio, who knows but he'll come again? Anoth. If Scipio beats him, he's the age's wonder. Who ever heard of Hannibal defeated? Anoth. Say what you will, with him our sun goes down. Enter Hannibal, Maharbal, Adherbal, and others, attended by some of the principal Citizens. Han. Farewell, my friends! To leave you thus exposed To Rome's revenge, afflicts me to the soul, Believe me. I have done what best I could To lighten your hard fate, and still will hope That Rome may gently deal with you. Farewell! Cit. O Hannibal! Farewell! farewell! farewell! Enter Ianthe, dressed as a Sibyl. Ian. O Hannibal! Dost thou remember me? Han. What seek'st thou, lady? Ian. What I cannot findâ Rest for this troubled brainâice for this feverâ Comfort to my despair. Thou art going, then? Go, with the curse of cruelty upon thee! Go, with an evil star, to Africa, And think of me upon the battle-field! Live to see Scipio riding o'er thy slain! Live to fly routed before Scipio's face! Live to behold the ruin of thy country! [She rushes away.] Adh. An evil omen, if the soldiers heard. Mah. Confound her, the mad witch! Adh. Ah, fair Iantheâ Good-bye to thy crazed, piteous loveliness!â And thee, too, goddess Juno, gazing down From yon sun-lighted promontory of woodsâ Through which thy temple sparkles like a flameâ To watch us go! It may be thou shalt yet Watch us return. Han. What though we ne'er return! Whatever henceforth shall become of me, My labour never will have been in vainâ Long shall Rome feel me in her heart of hearts!</field>

Westward, then, so please you, To Leptis we'll direct our course. Han. So be it. Sil. 'Tis not enough thou tenderly avoid'st To shock thy soldiers with ill auguries; Thou shouldst bespeak some favourable omen To wait thy solemn landing on these shores. Let me be byâI'll find one on the spot. Han. [Turning from him to pace the deck.] I was not near, my brothers! when you fought Each your last battle, dying in defeat! Thou, in a thunderstorm of destinyâ And thou, in a more lingering anguish, like The fitful fever-sorrow of thy life. O father! thou didst set these lives on fireâ Thou didst not live to see the after-storm Come pelting on their ashes! Where is the phÅnix that should rise from them? Be Afric's battle-plains, corpse upon corpse, Piled with the pride of Scipio ere we part, It will not give me these two lives again!â I welcome thee to Africa, Silanus. [The fleet continues its course along the coast.] Scene II. âCarthage. The house of Gisco. Ada alone. Ada. Ah, how the stir of great and loud events, Which make strong men turn pale, shakes all the strings Of my fond heart with a soft thrill of dreams, As if the great sea-winds should deign to play Sweet music on this little lute of mine! My Sophonisba! When I heard of thee, I thought that I should never cease to weep! I never thought to find one secret joy In all the horror of this misery! But he is coming! coming home to save us!â As one who, pacing up a gloomy street, Sees suddenly, through a wide-open door, A flood of sunshine, a green stretch of plain, And rosy mountain-tops against the skyâ So seem I to emerge from stifling grief, Into a bright astonishment of rapture.â And I shall see himâsee him in my youthâ See him whilst still my heart is warm to worshipâ Yes, see him! Oh, if I might speak to himâ Find utterance for this passion of sympathy! [Zeinab and Kora rush into the room. Zein. O Ada! Ada! Kora. Canst thou be so calm? Hast thou not heard it? Ada. Heard what? Kora. He is come! Hannibal's landed! Ada. Landed! Oh, when? where? Zein. Landed at Leptisâon his way now, doubtless, To Adrumetum! Kora. Oh, we soon shall hear He has met with Scipio! Zein. Ay, and sent him to us, In chains, like a new Regulus! Hear'st thou The shouting in the streets? 'tis all for him! Kora. We have flung the truce to the four winds. They say Our government has caused some Roman ships, Driven by storm into our port, to be Seized upon straightway; no more waiting now For Rome's consent to the hard terms of Scipio! Now, war, war, war! Would I might wear a sword, And fight myself with Scipio, hand to hand! Kora. Now, hearken, Zeinab! Soon as all is over, And Hannibal in triumph enters Carthage With all his army, is 't not time our fathers Should give us each to our affianced bridegrooms? We'll have a merry wedding. Zein. That we will! And if my wedding finery rivals not E'en Sophonisba's, queen although she wereâ Ha, Ada! Kora. She has fainted, just for joy! Stay, she revives! Ada. He is come, Sophonisba! Where is she?âOh, my lost, lost Sophonisba!â Leave me awhile, so best I shall recover. Kora. Poor Ada! Ah, thou wert so merry once! We'll call thy Zilla to thee. [Claps her hands.] Zilla, Zilla! [Exeunt Zeinab and Kora. Scene III. âThe camp of Hannibal at Adrumetum. Hannibal in his tent receiving a Messenger from Carthage. Mess. Most urgent is my mission: urgently The Senate bade me press your swift advance; They bid you lay by every care but thisâ With your best speed to march upon the Roman, The dread of whom hangs o'er our trembling city, Now standing on the dizzy brink of ruin. Han. You have spoke your errand, sir. Now, then, go back To those that sent you; tell them they o'erstep Their province, in so sending; let them order Their proper business, and leave mine to meâ To halt, to march, to fight the enemy Whene'er and wheresoever I think fit. You have had your answer. Mess. Is this all the comfort, My lord, that I am charged with? Han. This is allâ Make thou the best of it. Enter an Officer. Off. My lord, the chief TyphÅus, with two thousand cavalry, Has reached the camp in answer to your summons, And prays to lay his service at your feet. Han. Ay, surely; bring him to my tent forthwith, With all due ceremony. There, sir, comes Some comfort for your masters. This brave chief Brings me what most I need, and what yourselves Should have been better able to afford me. Mess. I am glad of this. Would I could bring back word King Masanissa had renewed his ties Of faith to Carthage! Enter another Officer. Han. What, returned so soon! What says the king? Off. I found him on the march, With all his force, to Scipio's camp at Tunes. I saw him, but my mission has not prospered. E'en as you bade me, I adjured the king, By all the kindly memories of youth, And in the name of her he loved and lost, To pledge himself anew to the old friendship, With promise of full pardon for the past, And your support in his new-conquered lands; But vainly; for, said he, 'twixt him and Carthage All ties had snapped asunder when his bride Was given to Syphax; and her death he laid More to the door of Carthage than of Rome. Han. Alone you saw him? This was no feigned passion? Off. We were alone: the true Numidian ire Flashed in his rolling eye; no hope from him. Han. Then we will do without him.âTell to Carthage What she may hope for from the penitence Of her old friend. Mess. You have done your best, my lord, Nor can we wonder at your ill success.â My lord, my lord! let me not rouse your wrath, If I dare plead the cause of these fair lands! Your horsemen treat them like a conquered soil, Lay waste our smiling corn, with axe and flame Spoil our rich olive-yards, and snatch away Our ripening fruits. Our rich men groan at home O'er their sweet summer gardens, where your Gauls, We hear, make havoc as in Italy. Must these things be? Han. They do but as I bid them; They are less kind to Scipio than yourselves, And grudge him but one ear of golden maize Or blade of grass; nor care to leave to him One tuft of myrtle brushwood on the plains, One spray of lentisk, that their own deft hands Can timely rob him of. I am sorry for you; But if I conquer, you shall yet have time To sow your corn afresh, and plant new vines. Mess. Adieu, my lord. The gods befriend your arms! [Exit Messenger. Scene IV. The camp of Scipio at Tunes. Enter Masanissa with a train of horsemen. Scipio goes in state to meet him. Scip. Hail, noble prince, the faithful friend of Rome! What means this gloom on Masanissa's brow? Mas. [Turning away.] Well know'st thou what my faithfulness hast cost me. Scip. Well do I know how great the sacrifice That has endeared thee to the heart of Rome, And mine, and to all hearts that in their fellows Can honour such fidelity as thine. Thou standest higher in my State's esteem, Trust me, than any other of her friends. I bid thee, then, take comfort. Mas. Idle words! Thou hast not loved like me! Take all my tribe To serve thee, if thou wilt; but in this quarrel, I'll never lead them more. Scip. And does my friend Shut to his heart against the words of friendship? Then must I call upon his nobler self, And bid him think what Afric looks for in him. Thou art a man, too wise, I think, and proud, To make a woman's love, although she were The pearl of women, thy life's all in all; With her soft voice she charms successful leisure, But hinders him who has not reached success. Mas. This lesson is no longer needed nowâ No danger of a second love for me. Scip. The safer for thee, on thy way to greatness, Whose price in this great sorrow has been paid, Beforehand, to exacting Nemesis. Thou art too young, yet, to forego the best, And having in thy view the golden prize, To waste regret upon the silver trophy! Let grief now spur thee to a noble wrath Against thy wrongers, not against thy friends! Remember thou hast had one deep revenge On Syphax, once thy rival, now Rome's captive; Carthage, whose perfidy bestowed thy bride On one who could not keep her, has received, And with thine aid, a signal chastisement; But more remains for her, when Hannibal Comes to receive the punishment of pride, And long relentlessness of enmity; In which great glory, great should be thy share, If thou art what I thought thee, Afric's pride, And not a boyish trifler. Mas. Scipio, no! No boyish trifler is the son of Gala! Judge not too hastily a wounded heart! To prove to thee it's still unshaken truth, I'll strive to tear out of that heart henceforth The recollection that you would not trust A Carthaginian bride to Masanissa, And left your friend's betrothed no last resource, Save poison, to escape out of your hands. You feared her charms would yet allure me back To Carthageâyou were wrongâbut let that pass! I shall not mourn for Sophonisba more Than may become manhood and royalty, Though I will love no other. Scip. Well said, prince! Now I know Masanissa once again! Now let all men see how I honour thee. [He leads him to a curule chair.] Lo, with this golden diadem I crown thee The king of all Numidia; in thy hand I place this ivory sceptre, and array thee In tunic and in toga, garnished each With their triumphal Phrygian broidery. No greater honour could myself receive, Though entering Rome in triumph. Hail, O king! [The Numidians raise loud shouts.] Mas. O Sophonisba! for such toys as these, Thinks he, I cast away thy priceless love? Enter Soldiers dragging in Zeba. Scip. Who's this? Sold. A spy, O Scipio! Like a cat, This cunning Berber drops as from the trees, Into our very midst; with tympanum, And charcoal brazier, plays demoniac pranks, Swinging his body round, like one possessed, In time to a strange tune; next, as I live, Tastes iron heated red on yonder forge, As 'twere some dainty morsel; lays it by, And greedily devours the prickly leaf, That tears our flesh like poisoned Libyan darts! A very sorcerer we thought him, yetâ Mas. This fellow comes to play the serpent-charmer. Scip. What is his story? Sold. In his broken Latin, He calls himself King Masanissa's tribesman. Mas. Dost thou so? Never has Massylian steed Borne thee to battle, nor Massylian lion Been flayed to clothe those limbs, the hangman's due! Zeba. I said soâbut I lied. A nobler tribe Than thine rides with me, for it ne'er bred traitors. Mas. Take that, thou dog! [Aims a blow at him.] Scip. Hold! Let me question him. What seek'st thou in my camp? Zeba. I came to do An errand for my lord. Scip. Ay, a well-paid one. Zeba. Thou liest! I serve him for himself, not gold. I came to spy thy camp. Scip. Good. Thou shalt first Tell me how many Berber horsemen ride Along with Hannibal. Zeba. What's that to thee? Scip. An idle question, doubtless. We will waive it, And thou shalt tell me of the elephantsâ How trained, how numerous. Zeba. I've not counted them. Scip. But if I fill thy hand with gold? Zeba. I'd spit Upon thy gold and thee. Scip. Or bid them scourge thee? Thoud'st make a guess then? Zeba. Not to save my head. Scip. Well, keep it for thine errand. They shall lead thee All round my campâthen haste to Hannibal And tell him what thou'st seen.âDo him no hurtâ Let him see all, then send him safely forth. [Exeunt Zeba and Soldiers. Scip. Hannibal's first forerunner. In good time! Nor mean I idly to await his coming, But, strengthened by your timely reinforcement, March on Naragara to morrow. Mas. Ay! You will do wrong, assuredly, to suffer Further delay of battle; everywhere The country is laid waste, and every day In which he leaves you isolated in it Is gain to Hannibal. Scip. True; yet my heart Feels well assured the enemy of Rome Is marching to his downfall. Pray you enter. [Scipio and Masanissa enter Scipio's tent. Scene V. âHannibal's Camp at Zama. Enter Hannibal, Maharbal, and Zeba. Mah. The more fool he, for sparing thee! Han. For that I owe him thanksâand thee, for thy brave service. My heart could scarce have spared my noble Zeba, Nor could the cause that's dearest to my heart. What is he like? Couldst thou divine if most His soldiers love or fear him? Zeba. They, methought, Where'er he passed amongst them, heard his words, And did his bidding, with a stern contentment. We worship theeâwe are thy slaves, thy children! To them he seems an honoured elder brother. Han. How deals he with the king? Zeba. With his cold smile He charms him, as the Psylli charm the snake, And the fierce king's his servant. Ask no moreâ I hate him! For he bears the evil eye, And when its blue light dwelt on me I shuddered. He spared my life, but none the less I hate him, For he will do thee mischief. [Exit. Mah. Thy new rival Puts a bold face upon it. Han. He has clenched, By that composed and firm self-confidence, A resolution I have mused uponâ I mean to meet him first in conference, Ere we join battle. Mah. What's this jest? Han. 'Tis none. Mah. Thou seek a conference with Scipio! Thou That hast ne'er met a Roman general yet, But 'twas to send him routed from thee! Thou, In the gods' name, to what end? Han. To offer peace. Mah. I'll never wonder more. Were it not well To make a comfortable compact next, To marry Scipio's sister? Han. Calm thyself!â I, if I fail, lose Carthage; he will lose Only his single army and himself. Mah. And Rome besides! Han. I hope so, in the end. But Carthage, if I fall, falls in the hour. 'Tis better I should offer peace to-day, With an unbroken army, than to-morrow Beg for it, as perhaps I may, with none. Mah. Thou beg for peace! Thou doubt of victory! Go, ask those long-haired giants, or those fellows In white and scarlet yonder! By my soul, I do not know thee, Hannibal, to-day! Peace! Offer peace! What, fold our arms at last, And stare across the sea, whilst smiling Rome Plants, sows, and reaps, on our old battle-fields! For how long, pray thee? Han. Till the true hour strike! Let children find time slow; to a man's faith The future is the present. Peace no more Divides us from our rival than yon sea does, Which with full-swelling sails we o'erstep, when The winds call, and our armaments are ready. Why, what is peace to the true heart of hate, Save leisure time to sharpen a new sword? Mah. Why doubt of victory? Han. I had not doubted, Had it been possible to put off battle; But since it is not, and since Masanissaâ Thou hast heard Zeba's tale as well as Iâ To my three thousand of Numidian horse, Opposes twice three thousand of his ownâ Mah. The villains! They are welcome to my best, Though they were twice as many! Han. That I doubt not. Thou hast heard, too, he brings six thousand foot. Well, then, since I, with all these untried levies, And fresh-caught elephants trained on the instant, That Carthage in her haste has heaped together, Am wanting still in cavalryâsince thus, Scipio, with Masanissa on his side, With my own weapons fights meâI may choose To pause before I risk against such odds My country, whose whole self hangs in the balance, As it hath ever hung, when once a foe Hath touched her soil. Mah. Oh, I vow to the gods! 'Tis Carthage, 'tis herself, I execrate. But for her folly, her besotted folly, In so neglecting her defence at home, Whilst yet the war was distant from her gates, Thou hadst stayed there, and Scipio ne'er been here. But so it is, so evermore will be! Still busy at their paltry money-getting, Bargaining for their gold trash from the south, Their shining pebbles, and their elephant-tusks, Their ostrich-plumes, and grinning Ethiop slaves, And what not elseâor holding jubilee O'er their Byzacean vintages and harvestsâ Their stupid citizens are well content That all their fighting should be done for them, By better men than they, whilst, clothed in purple, They feast and dance, till lo! the conqueror's on them! Han. I cannot help it. Such as Carthage is, I must at present be content to take her. Haply, I yet may find some time to mend her. Mah. I will not ask what terms thou mean'st to offer, Lest I should choke to hear them. Han. Be content; I shall but offer peace. Let Scipio pause, Ere he rejects the gift. If he rejects itâ Why, then, let's blow the trumpets, and our hearts Rush to the revel with the wonted joy. Mah. I have no more to say. [Exit. Enter Silanus. Han. What, thou, Silanus? Thou find'st me envying Scipio. Sil. Scipio's happy. Why dost thou envy him? Han. For having that Which I have lacked, with all my sounding triumphsâ An army of true brothers, one with him, In language, race, and hope. Sil. Thine army loves thee. Fast as thy thousands perished, year by year, Fresh levies flocked, wild from their woods and deserts, To learn the new religion. Han. It loves me. Where'er I call, they follow. Did I bid them March to the siege of Carthage, they would fly As to the sack of Rome. It loves me onlyâ They love in him their country and their cause. I have shaken Rome, yet has she stood, and stands, Not by the energy of single genius, But by th'accumulated wills of all, And by the pride her very name still breathes Into the meanest of her citizens. The vanquished general that has done his best, Comes back to Rome to take her thanks for it; But Carthage pays her thanks in her own way. Hasdrubal-Gisco wanders now in exile, Because he has no heart for crucifixion. Sil. There have been men that have deserved it less. Han. Carthage is fainting, but the soul of Rome, More iron yet than iron, tried in a furnace Of seven-fold heated fury, glowed, but bent not. Sil. You are of Asia, and of Asia still, Coloured by cruel Afric's tints of fire, Will be the fashion of your destiniesâ Like a grand summer for a space to reign, Then roll in thunder from the world away. From Asia come the base and the sublime, Whose clashing contrasts, of your country's story Make the rich poem which mankind will read Admiring, when your race has passed from earth, And all you did is lost. You rest on Afric, Like a great ship on oceanâthe winds blow, And the proud fabric, shattered into fragments, Vanishes, leaving on the waves no trace. You are th'enchanter, whose all-potent wand Preserves the splendid vision to the world; But let your wand be broken, and perchance The hand that dropped your dazzling empire here May snatch it up, with all its marble pride Of town and temple, gaudy markets, gold Of summer harvests, luxury of groves And gardens, pomp of ships, and flashing armsâ To crush it like a child's toy, fling away The giant ruins where no hand shall find them! Han. I yet may dig my state a deep foundation, I yet may find for her a strength more real Than the enchanter's wand. Sil. 'Tis Europe, Europeâ Proclaimed the heir of all the rich-souled Eastâ Absorbs the past and claims the future. Han. Let her! And let me struggle against prophecy! I will not be disheartened for my Carthage. Oh, she, methinks, will turn to bay 'gainst fate! Nor shall she, whilst I live, send forth her sons, In that sweet secret island of the west, Whose key she guards, to hide their vanquish'd heads. And if she rise againâas once she roseâ Thrust back th'aggressor, chased him to his gates, And almost pulled to earth his towering pride, Buried almost, in its tremendous ruins, That European culture you admireâ 'Twill not again be almost. Sil. You alone Can double that strange feat. You dead, how soon Will the gods send your twin? Han. Let me but first Do all that lies in one man's power, to make My country lean no longer on one man, But on the zeal of all! Sil. Then does there wait youâ And heartily I wish you luck thereinâ A struggle with an enemy as stubborn As Rome herselfâsuch a charm'd strength resides In blind and greedy imbecility. But for your near concern in it, my mind Could study, not without a curious pleasure, The problem of such characters as those You fight against at home. Han. I grudge it not to you. Sil. Their fellows' welfareâhonourâjusticeâthese, I comprehend, are words that mean to them No more than might a SophocleÃ¤n chorus To any savage of the Bruttian hills; But to forego the vanity of country, That pride in her success's showiness, Which selfishness itself might love the taste ofâ To sell the splendour of their city's crown, The world's submission, envy, praise, and wonder, In daily barter for their petty spite, Their petty greedânay, e'en their noontide sleepâ That is a bargain which perplexes all My powers of calculation to conceive of. Han. I leave you to sum up the loss and gain; Long have I ceased to study that hard page. [Exit. Sil. Scipio and Hannibal brought face to face! Here stands war's passionate heroic poem; There, its cold logic, pitiless as fate! [Exit. Scene VI. âA rising ground between the camps of Hannibal and Scipio. Hannibal and Scipio are seen approaching from opposite directions. Enter Zeba and Numidians. Zeba. Oh, if this conference should end in peace, I swear I'll go stab Scipio in his tent! This battle that we longed for snatched from us! And I, who burned to see o'er yonder plain Brave Masanissa like an ostrich run, Until my spear should catch himâ A Num. Look, oh, look! Scipio himself approaching. Zeba. He is punctual. Num. A stately figure, and a goodly face. That man, I swear, is fit to lead an army. Who's this rides to his side and speaks to him? Zeba. That's LÃ¦lius. Ay, and there goes Masanissa! Oh, as I live, I'll have that horse of his To-morrow, and the head of him that rides it, Or never throw spear more! Presumptuous upstart! Puffed up by Scipio's gifts and flatteries, To think himself the greatest prince in Afric! Enter from opposite sides Hannibal with Maharbal and Numidians, and Scipio with LÃ¦lius, Masanissa, &amp;c. Mas. At last! Behold the demon-conqueror Draws near, as by a sorcerer's spell constrained, With a superb reluctance, to salute thee! Thou hast conjured well! Scip. That is the man I dreamed. [Hannibal and Scipio approach, dismount, and salute each other, whilst those on either side withdraw to a little distance.] LÃ¦l. So, that is he! Mas. Still silent! How they stand Each gazing on the other!âThere he is, then! Dead Hasdrubal was like him.âHow he seems, On Scipio's face, with eyes of fire to read, As in a book, the story of to-morrow! LÃ¦l. And Scipio, on his face, is studying CannÃ¦. Mas. Can he be doomed? With a half-guilty knowledge, As of a sacred secret, I foresee How the stern genius, throned on that man's brow So splendidly to-day, must fall to-morrow. LÃ¦l. His time is come.âHe speaks. Han. Scipio, in you I see an untried foe, the youthfulest Of all that Rome has sent to cope with me; But yet, I think, the noblest. Scip. I am proud That Hannibal so thinks. Han. Therefore, I sought This conferenceâto offer you a gift That shall not shame the giver nor the taker. Scip. What is this gift? I wait to hear it from you. Han. I come to offer peace. Scip. Now, Hannibal, You crown me with a wreath that Rome will envy! But yet I seek a nobler. Han. Not so! Profit By the brief breathing space destiny still Leaves you, to choose the future. On that spot Where now we stand, to both, but most to you, Wisdom cries, Halt! I bid you hear her voice. Scip. Proceed, I pray, and if it be the voice Of wisdom, I both hear it and obey. Han. Shall I remind you, then, of what you know, How yesterday I was the present dread Of Italy, the ever haunting spectre That stood and frowned into her shrinking eye? The children, born since first I crossed the Alps, Have grown up as familiar with my name As with their fathers', and without my presence Beneath their skies could scarce conceive existence, Nor knew what peace meant. And how is it now? The country that has been to me so long In place of mine own land, sees me no more! No lover parted from his mistress yet With such a mighty sorrow as was mine, To leave the land I scourged for fifteen yearsâ The land I loved and hated, all those years, With such a love and hate as never yet Found room together in the heart of man. You, who well know, and will not scorn to own, That Rome watched breathless my departing host, Nor dared draw nearer by a single stepâ That Rome rejoiced, as o'er a hundred victories, When the sea rolled 'twixt her and Hannibalâ You well can image what that sorrow was. Scip. Ay, no man better! Han. Yes, I understand you! By that fierce joy which leaped up in your soul When first you touched the soil of Africa, You can conceive what my soul felt, that day When back on still retreating Italy I gazed, till Italy was there no more. Now, whilst you triumph in my grief, I bid you Prolong that triumph whilst 'tis in your power! Take peace whilst still with honour you can take itâ Take peace, whilst you can feel that you have won it! Your arms have brought me here to offer itâ Your arms have brought me here, who once had camped Before Rome's gates, and offered up for sale Rome's forum. Well may you be satisfied! Measure your gain by all that I forego, Who, face to face with all that most I hate, Now offer to thrust back into its sheath A bloodless sword, offer to join the hands Of Rome and Carthage o'er a million graves, And enter first the city of my birth, After a banished life of war with Rome, The friend of Rome, and not her conqueror. Let this content you. Scip. Well might it content me That Hannibal seeks peaceâyet that he seeks it, Still persuades war, so great it shows to be The straits of Carthage. Han. Take no heed of that! Think rather of your own straits, and your country's! You are alone, far in a hostile land, Now half deserted, and soon wholly so, And stripped of all provisionâyou yourself Cut off from aid and refuge in the sea: Behind you Carthage, Utica, and Tunes; Before you I who speak, with all my army. Now, with that veteran army at my back, Unconquered to this hour, I offer peace. Do you accept it? Scip. Name, I pray, your terms. Han. These, then, in brief. I offer, in the name Of CarthageâSpain, Sardinia, Sicily, And all the isles that lie betwixt the shores Of Africa and Europe. All for which Carthage and Rome have warred almost to deathâ All this I freely offer up to Rome. Let her rejoice, thus easily to keep What she has struggled for at so much cost. Leave Carthage her possessions on this coast, So long her own: take all the rest yourselves. Scip. Hannibal, trust me, with a grave attention I have weighed all the words that you have spoken, And hear no whisper in my heart, that tells me I am reserved to be a monument Of youth's presumption signally chastised. The terms you offer should have come before. You should have offered them from Italy, Adding your own departure to the sum, Since all that you propose to render up Already has been wrenched away from you. Before you came, in a most abject terror Your countrymen did send and sue to me, With humblest supplications, to spare Carthage, And not avenge on her one man's ambition. I granted them the instant truce they asked, Requiring those conditions you have named, And more, far more than these, as well you know. Your humbled citizens, with thanks, agreed; And I sent home to gain the Senate's sanction. Meanwhile, before that sanction had arrived, Came suddenly the news that you had landed; Then straight their fear was changed to insolence. Uprose they in their full-blown confidence, Broke through the truce, seized on some Roman ships, Then sheltered in their harbour, and withal Mocked and maltreated those I sent to claim them. Now, then, shall I, for their ill faith's reward, Go back from the conditions first proposed, And grant an easier peace? It cannot be. I will not even seek my Senate's pleasure Touching this matter, till you shall agree To yield up, as preliminary terms, All that your State did formerly accept. Nor for Rome's honour can I ask for less, Though 'tis of Hannibal himself I ask. Han. To justify my country I disdain, Or to fling back your charges on yourself; I leave them to the page of history, And bid you welcome to the field to-morrow. Scip. So be it. There we'll meet, then. [They remount their horses.] Mas. [advancing.] Hannibal! Han. Who's this that speaks to me? Scip. It is the king. Han. I know him not. Mas. O Hannibal, beseech thee, Hear thy good genius! Do not fight this battle! Take Scipio's terms, and save thyself and army. Han. Scipio, adieu. Scip. Fare thee well, Hannibal. Mas. Am I a dog, that he should scorn me so? No more of lingering pity for her people! On Carthage fall the blood of Sophonisba! Zeba. [pausing for a moment.] Thou prince of traitors! I will meet with thee, Be sure, on Zama's field. Mas. Thou shalt be welcome! Count not too surely on thy parting from me. Mah. Gods give us a good riddance of ye all! [Exeunt Hannibal and Scipio, with their attendants. Scene VII. âThe Plain of Zama. The armies of Hannibal and Scipio drawn out for battle. Enter Hannibal, Maharbal, Adherbal, and Hanno, riding slowly along the lines. Adher. [To Maharbal.] His battle-smile is there, and cheers the soldiers; But that is not the young gay heart of CannÃ¦, Which lightly jested, till the soldiers caught The jest too, and laughed with us. Mah. Ay, since then, We all are changed a little. Adher. And the times, too. I feel more strange to-day in Africa Than e'er I felt in vanquished Italy. Ay, o'er those blooming plains of asphodel, Once so familiar to my eyes, I think The sight of yonder Romans in array Brings more home-feeling to my soul, this hour, Than aught I've looked on yet. Mah. I vow my heartâ Warms to it kindlier than to wife and children.â Plague on this horse for stumbling! After battle I'll choose me out the best of Masanissa's.â 'Tis time I should ride forward to my post. By heavens, if I should live a century, I still should take youth with me to the charge. Hanno. Ay, go! Put Masanissa to the rout. I'll do my best by LÃ¦lius, and, mayhap, We'll somewhere meet again in chase of Scipio. Mah. [To Hannibal.] My charger waits the spur! Han. Give me thy hand, then. Farewell! Send Masanissa to his love, A little more crest-fallen than she saw him, At their last meeting. Mah. Pray the fiends, I may! [He rides to the left wing.] Hanno. Ay, there he goes! I feel, I know not why, As if I never should behold him more. Adher. So would he love to die.âHow these wild eyes Flash up to Hannibal, from rank to rank, Like the broad, sudden, simultaneous gleam Of serried spears in sunlight. Oh, this man Could train the very leopards of the desert To fight 'gainst Rome for Carthage! Hanno. The gods bless him I, too, must to my post, O Hannibal! Han. Greet LÃ¦lius well from me. Adieu! adieu! [Hanno rides to the right wing.] It is a glorious dawn. Last night the moon Bathed all the plain with memories of Capua, And from the thickets of rose-laurel drew A warm Italian fragrance. Adher. We may yet Breathe that again. Han. Perhaps so. Forward now. [Rides slowly before the front line, pausing from time to time to address them.] You slingers of the isles! take your best aim! Let us of Afric see your boasted skill!â You Moors, beware your tyrant, Masanissa, Who comes on fire to claim you for his bondslaves!â Ligurians, now's your time to snatch revenge For all the thousands of your brethren, still Cheapened in Roman markets. Let them see These be the fields you best know how to tillâ Gauls, be you faithful to your fathers' feud, And, as your kindred in mad revel still Drain from Postumius' skull their sweetest draughts, So shall the heart, henceforth, of all your race Feast high with triumph on the fall of Rome! [All raise loud shouts as Hannibal passes on.] Now for the men of Carthage! Well for me, My trust is in those veterans in our rear, And not upon those countrymen of mine, Nor on these half-trained savages in front, Whose shouts are sounding still from a full heart! Yet they will fly like wild-cats at the foe, And leave on Scipio's legions many a scratch, Ere he can hew a pathway through their bodies. [He pauses before the Carthaginian line.] Adher. These should be soldiersâit was in them once. They are not cowards by inheritanceâ A siege of Carthage might make men of them. Han. You men of Carthage! You, of all this host, Have most to fight forâyou, no hired allies, But true-born sons and brothers of the cause! Those veterans fight for glory, and for meâ You fight for home, for vengeance, and for glory! For a long future of such blissful hours As all your envied past was breathed away inâ For wives and children on the temple-floors Praying for you, with the same hope and horror As thrice, ere now, have knocked against the hearts Of Rome's own maids and matrons, and again Shall knock, be you this day but true to Carthageâ For the sky-rending uproar that shall greet you, When you come conquerors in, heirs newly crowned, Of the world's empire, come to struggle through The praises of the rapture-drunken crowd, To those that meet you with their dear embrace, And tell them, We have saved you! we, your fathers, Husbands, and sonsâwe conquered, and we saved you! For this you fightâyes, for the hope of hopes, Upon the hateful neck of Rome to stamp With all your strength, and break itâon the winds Scatter her ashes, and then drag her name For ever on the broad high-road of Time, Bound to the chariot-wheels of your renown! [The Carthaginian line raises a loud and prolonged shout as Hannibal passes on. Ay, they mean wellâ Adh. So do these elephants, I doubt not, though they're new to battle too. Majestic monsters! Fresh from their first schooling, They understand not how our destinies Hang on their aptness to perform their lesson. Han. I would harangue them too, if they knew Syrian. Now for the rear. Adh. Where lies the hope of Carthage. Scene VIII. âThe front of the Roman army. The Hastati in the first line, commanded by Octavius, confront the elephants; on the right Masanissa, with Numidian cavalry, confronts Maharbal; on the left, LÃ¦lius, with Roman cavalry, confronts the Carthaginian cavalry, commanded by Hanno. Between the two armies the light horse on both sides are skirmishing. A Hast. O Jupiter! They stand like a turreted wall! I have counted eighty of them. A Standard-bearer. So have I! But didst thou ne'er see elephants before? Thou hast ne'er fought in Spain, then! We can kill themâ They are not gods, nor yet so wise as men, For all their cunning. Hast. We can't kill them all. May Jove confound them! Oct. So he will, be sure. Fear not the elephants! I have told you how You shall avoid all mischief from these monsters, And turn their fury back upon their masters. Trust me, the music you shall greet them with Shall send them dancing to far other steps Than those their masters taught them. If you fail To drive the whole huge squadron floundering backward, Take courage still, and watch how easily Our nimble Velites, unharmed themselves, Like children at their playâso blind and drunken These creatures' rage is, when they suffer painâ Shall tempt them through the avenues we've left them Into the open plain. [On the other side.] 1st Eleph. Driver. Methinks the beasts look well disposed to-day, For their share of the game! 2nd Eleph. Driver. To tell the truth, I never set mine own beast to the charge, Without an inward creeping! As for theseâ Betwixt mock-combats, and an earnest battle, The best trained find a difference. And of late, Those cunning Romans yonder have begun To spy into their little weaknesses. 1st Eleph. Driver. Nay, nay! The elephants love Hannibal As we do, and would scorn to fail him. 3rd Eleph. Driver. Oh! How merrily those light Numidian horse Skim o'er the plain, like dancersâround and round, Backwards and forwards! Zeba's there, be sure. I vow I envy them those nimble creatures! 4th Eleph. Driver. The signal! Oh, the signal! To charge! [The elephants advance, and at the same moment the horses and trumpets of the Romans make a loud clamour, and flights of arrows assail them.] 1st Eleph. Driver. This way, this way! Infernal din! Push on Right for the Roman line! 2nd Eleph. Driver. Oh, here we go, Pell-mell on our own cavalry! 3rd Eleph. Driver. We are lost! [Some of the elephants rush towards the right wing of the Carthaginian army, some towards the Roman line, and trample down the Velites.] Stand.-bearer. [caught up in the trunk of an elephant]. The gods receive my soul! Friends, friends, avenge me! A Hast. Alas! Ye gods! the Velites! O horror! Oct. Stand fast! stand fast, my men! They shall not harm you! Here is free room between your lines! Heed not Their roaring! Here is ample room for them! Velites, look you aim against their trunks! Right, right! Now dance away from them! Back, back! They'll follow you into the open plain! Leave those that have passed through to take their wayâ They'll give no trouble now. Well have you stood The monstrous onset! Rest assured, these giants Have wrought more harm to their own side than ours! Well done, you elephants, well done! You see They trample down the Punic horse like grass! O LÃ¦lius, now's thy time! Now for thy charge! Ay, there they go! O elephants, we thank you! [The Hastati advance.] Scene IX. âOn the Carthaginian left Maharbal and cavalry, the elephants rushing in amongst them. Mah. Death and confusion! Here they come on us, too! Where go you? Forward, forward! To the charge! Enter Zeba. Zeba. Ha, general! Mah. Here's disaster, by my life! The curse of Moloch on these frantic devils! Enter Masanissa, charging with cavalry. Zeba. Base dog, and traitor! I am glad to see thee! Mas. Take that, thou slave, whose tribe shall be my bondsmen! [They exchange darts, and Zeba is wounded.] Go, feed the jackals! who shall bury thee? [Gallops on.] Zeba. My turn at last! Would life but hold awhile, That I may rally yet my scattered troop, Or die at least in sight of Hannibal!â There falls Maharbal! [Rides up to him.] Mah. Zeba, I am slain. If e'er thou shouldst meet Hannibal again, Wish him good bye for me. Zeba. I will, my lord. Mah. Tell me, has Hanno's horse been routed, too? Zeba. They fly, my lord! Mah. The foot, have they advanced? Zeba. The front line has gone forward, and fights fiercely. Mah. The brave barbarians! Zeba. But the second line Hangs back. Mah. The Carthaginian cowards! Curse them! [Dies.] Zeba. Now for a race against departing life! [Exit. Scene X. âThe reserve of Hannibal's army drawn up at a little distance in the rear, watching the progress of the battle in front. Adherbal commanding the Spaniards. 1st Span. Alack! alack! On either wing, the dust Rolls the wrong way! Good bye to them! There they goâ LÃ¦lius and Masanissa at their heels! As for the elephants, where are they? 2nd Span. Madâ Fledâslaughtered! You may ask, where, too, just now, Are Hanno and Maharbal! 3rd Span. You'll not find them In yonder rout, I'll swear! Never Maharbal Turned bridle from the Roman squadrons yet! He lies on yonder field, I'll be bound for him. 4th Span. Ha! The Hastati have found their match methinks! Well done! well done! Those young troops fight like us! They'll leave us nought to do! 5th Span. Cowards! O cowards! What, will those Carthaginians bear to see The front line hewn to pieces? Shame upon them! We fight for him, and not for these. 6th Span. We know 'Tis us he looks to, for the victoryâ And we shall win it too, let cavalry And elephants fly where they will! 5th Span. The gods! 'Tis he himself! He dashes to the front! He'll bring them to the charge! Why, by the gods, Will he not take us, too? 6th Span. Must we stand here Like effigies of soldiers set in line For children to make sport with? Adh. [approaching.] Patience! patience! Your time will come! This victory will be yours, Your winning like the others! Never fear, It will be yours to rout the Roman legions, Ere LÃ¦lius and the traitor Masanissa Return from their hot chase. 5th Span. And we will do it! [Adherbal passes along the line.] Scene XI. âThe front of the Roman army. The Hastati engaged with the Gauls and Ligurians in the first line of Hannibal's army. The Principes are drawn up behind. Scipio, &amp;c., watching the conflict in front. A Tribune. They yield! they yield! Well done, you brave Hastati! Right! Drive them back upon the Punic line!â Scipio! give but the word, and in a second, We're face to face with our true adversary, Waiting us yonder! 1st Decurion. Oh, they turn at last! Their right gives way ... See, like wild boars they rush To rend their laggard comradesâright, you Celts! Ay, fight it out between you! 2nd Decurion. Ha! who's he, That fiery horseman, spurring to and fro, Along the Carthaginian line? He points His hand this way! He cheers them to the charge! Scip. 'Tis Hannibal himselfâno other. [A loud shout is heard from the Carthaginian line.] Ha! Their hearts are in that thunder. [The Carthaginian line advances furiously, and the Hastati begin to fall back in disorder.] Principes! Advance and follow me. [The Principes advance to the charge.] Scene XII. âHannibal's reserve drawn up as before. Enter Hannibal and Adherbal. The Carthaginians are seen flying towards the rear in confusion. Han. Level your spears! Thrust back these fugitives! Stand fast, and let them not disorder you! Well done! So! Let them scatter o'er the plain, Or run again on Scipio, if they will. Adh. 'Tis now at last the battle must begin; I think 'twill be the hardest of our fights. Han. I looked for scarce else than the rout of these, And the first lineâstill 'twas a furious fight, And I may trust has told on Scipio's forces. 'Tis vain to mourn now for my cavalry, But since they are lost, I must strain every nerve To break those legions, ere the enemy's Returns to join the contest. Adh. Who will bring us Maharbal back, and Hanno? Han. None, I fear.â My veterans! my heart's comrades! friends and brothers! Who never yet have known defeat or shameâ Whom Rome of yore flew open-mouthed to meet, Till back you scourged her like a froward curâ You, whom her legions now for fifteen years Have trembled at, like schoolboys at the rodâ You, in whose midst, betwixt bare earth and sky, Wrapt in my soldier's cloak, I have slept so oft, In happy haste, upon the battle's brink, My sweetest sleep, and dreamt my sweetest dreams!â O you, my life's great boast! in whose dear ranks I have been proud to feel myself as much Soldier as generalâwhose fierce hearts have drunk In many a draught, from the same cup with me, The battle's madness, and the victory's raptureâ Whose fiery thirst Rome's fear so long has balked Of that sweet madness, that dear raptureânow She offers it once more! She dares at last, Fresh from a foe less dangerous, on this field To give and take the deadliest blows of war. Come, then, surpass yourselves! Come, crown the past! Come, teach her the old lesson once again, And teach it once for all! Sold. [Shouting.] We will! we will! [Hannibal rides forward to survey the Roman army.] Scene XIII. âThe space between the two armies covered with corpses of men and horses. Enter Scipio, &amp;c. Scip. Sound the recall for the Hastati! Ha! Here come they, all triumphant from pursuit! Hence to Octavius! Bid him halt his men, And form, on that side of the heaps of slain.â My gallant soldiers! nobly have you fought To-day for Rome; but there is more to do; For Hannibal, with all his veterans, Th'unpunished ravagers of Italy, The insolent affronters of our pride, Waits yonder with his last presumptuous sneer, With his last hope, to unsheath his last sword! On, then, and double your renown on him! But, first, ere we can spring to the attack, These corpses that encumber so the ground Must be thrust hence, to leave our charge free space. Undo the work your own good steel hath done, And push these gory heaps to either side. A Trib. of the Principes. My sword already cleaves to my right hand. A Centurion. Oh, 'twas no child's play! Hannibal's soul had breathed Such rage and hate into those savages, You would have thought they were the Carthaginians, The Carthaginians were the mercenaries. A Princeps. Till Hannibal appeared! Another. And then, indeed, We saw the sorcerer's power! Cent. Oh, yes, and felt itâ As on the Punic faint-hearts rushed at lastâ By the new fury kindled in ourselves! To know that every blow we struck was seen By those proud eyes, and thrilled in that proud soul, Doubled the ardour caught from Scipio's voice. A Dec. 'Twas good to see how, in their headlong flight, They got from Hannibal no better comfort Than levelled spears to turn them back again! And yet they had fought well. Scip. [Examining one of the corpses.] Ha! this is heâ This is Maharbal! Yesterday we saw him, Well I remember, at the conference. Trib. The very same! A grim and grisly faceâ The dying rage still glaring! Little thought he, When hotly spurring o'er Italian plains, His fate reserved him from so many fields, To bite the dust of Zama! Scip. Even so. A very gallant general was he, Nor did a nobler band of cavalry Ride after any man into the field. Now are they scattered to the winds of heaven, Never to meet again; or stretched, like him, Beside their horses, on that field which soon Ravens and vultures shall dispute with silence.â Now for the struggle! Now for victory! [Hannibal, at the head of his reserve, advances to meet Scipio.] Han. Now, if you need a war-cry, I will give it! When you charge Rome, remember Hasdrubal! [His troops close with the Romans, shouting âRemember Hasdrubal!â The two armies fight furiously.] Scene XIV. âThe rear of Hannibal's army. Enter LÃ¦lius and Masanissa with cavalry and fall upon it from opposite sides, whilst the front ranks are engaged with Scipio. Enter Hannibal and Adherbal from different directions. Adh. By all the fates! a battle lost. Han. Not yet. I'll wrench the victory back from fate itself. [Exit Adherbal. Ha! there's a body of Numidian horse Flying, but still unbroken. They shall yet Turn back with me. [His horse is killed by an arrow. Fugitives from the front begin to press upon him.] My fourth to-day! Indeed, I think my last. Enter Zeba, forcing his way through the press. Zeba. Where is he? I will pass! [Dismounts.] Mount, mount, my lord, and rally to the charge The last of my brave tribe ... Maharbal's slain ... I bring thee his farewell ... O Hannibal, I have ridden my last for thee! Ah, my sweet charger, Bear my lord safe this day! Han. Dear and brave youth, Thou diest as Hannibal would wish to die. Zeba. Then I die happy. [Dies.] Han. [Mounts and rides up to the Numidians.] Come, revenge your chief, My desert warriors! Come, then, charge with me! Oh, charge but once again with me, my children, And win me back the victory! Num. Ay, or die! [They charge.] Enter Masanissa, galloping to meet Hannibal. Mas. Now, thou world troubler, fallen from thy proud heaven! I have a word for thee. Han. And I an answer. [They fling their javelins. Masanissa falls from his horse wounded, and is carried off by his followers. Scipio hastens up with troops.] Scene XV. âA hillock in another part of the field. A body of Gauls and Spaniards on the summit. Enter Hannibal, riding up to them. Han. My own true soldiers! do not yet despair! You have done miraclesâadd yet one more, And save this day for me!âMy glorious Spaniards! My boyhood's comrades in your own dear land, The first I lovedâfollow me once again! Stand by me now, as youâand youâand you, Stood by me once around my father's corpse, When the VettÃ³nes yelled for it like wolves, And tore at it by hundreds! Must I leave This field without my victory? Span. Never! never! [They charge down the hill on the Romans led by Scipio.] Scene XVI. âAnother part of the field. Enter Adherbal, riding up to Hannibal. Adh. All lost at last! The army is destroyed! Carthage is ruined! Han. No, not whilst I breathe! Adh. O gods! what possible end to this despair, Save to bound headlong 'gainst that wall of spears? The thought is almost joy. Han. Hold! dare not waste The life that's due to Carthage! Adh. Let me die! Han. I will not let thee die. Why, once I heard thee, Forsaken by the woman thou didst dote on, Swear with a smile to find another love As lovely and more loving! Do, as then; Smile at thy fate, and live! Adh. Live! live! For what? Han. Carthage, and vengeance! And to save what's left Of the most glorious army in the world. Come, snatch a moment yet from death and fate, To gather a poor remnant from this field. [Exeunt Hannibal and Adherbal. Scene XVII. âA group of palm-trees in a sandy plain between Zama and Adrumetum. Underneath them is a tent, in front of which sits an aged Hermit. Enter Hannibal, Adherbal, and a small body of horsemen. Han. Take heart, my faithful friends! We will rest here A moment in the shade. [Dismounting.] Old man, I greet thee. Her. Mine eyes are somewhat dimâwhat men be you? Han. The brightness of our arms is veiled in dust, Or doubtless, friend, you would have guessed us soldiers. You have a well, and we are very thirsty, For we have ridden far. Have you food here? Her. No, not a morsel, I'm very old, And shall not want it long. Han. Dismount, dear friends. Adherbal, thou wilt live for me and Carthage? Adh. For whom but thee, then, have I lived so long? Her. Methinks I have been dreaming many a day. Did not a mighty army pass by once? Methought I saw their spears shine in the distance, And heard the brazen rattle of their arms. Han. We are that army. A Sold. Hast thou ever heard, Old father, of a certain Hannibal? Her. If I have heard the name, I have forgotten. Han. Alack! 'tis not the time now to remind him. How far is't, pray thee, friend, to Adrumetum? Her. A long day's journey. Adh. [Starting up from the ground.] Bid the trumpets blow! Han. The sun has smit his brain. His day is over. [They surround him and support him as he falls again.] Know'st thou me, friend? An Off. Alas, not even thee!â He speaks againâcan you hear what he says? Adh. The battle is not lost!âIt is not true That Hannibal is slain!âOh, where's Maharbal? Han. Soon shalt thou join him, martial spirit! Adh. Come! We march to Rome. [Dies.] Han. 'Tis over. A Sold. Yet one more Left by the wayside! Another. We would weep for him, But Zama sears our hearts. Another. We need not weepâ We still have thee. Han. Now fare thee well, my friend! I shall have time to mourn thee. Make for him A soldier's grave. We cannot dig so deep But 'twill be shallow to that deeper grave Our long regret shall hollow in our hearts. [They bury the corpse.] Now mount again, my friends, and let's be going. [All mount and exeunt. Scene XVIII. âCarthage. A chamber in the house of Gisco opening on a balcony. Enter Gisco passing hastily through it. Enter Ada as seeking him. Ada. O father, whither go you? Ah, one instant! Tell me if he will pass along this street? Gis. Ay, truly. If you choose to add your eyes To all the thousands that will stare upon him, Go, get you to your balcony, and thence You'll see him make his entry very shortly. A glorious spectacle! Ada. Glorious to me.â The crowd began to gather ere the dawnâ I could not sleep, and watched them from the turret. O father, I have something yet to say:â Father, I hear each hour some new sad tale Of our poor slaughtered citizens, whose wives And children may expect them now in vain; And some not slaughtered, but, more wretched still, Destined to Roman slavery. When I think On all these things, my heart seems like to burst. I cannot help the dead, but I can help A few, a very few. .... Gis. How help? Enough; I cannot wait till you have dried your tears. Weep for yourself, for me, for all your kin, For I can promise you 'tis come to that. Ada. Father, I would that you would charge yourself With all my jewels. I shall never more, Believe me, wear them. Could they help to ransom But oneâbut one of those unhappy ones, Father, 'twould be a joy to me till death! Gis. What folly's this? Your poetry has crazed you! I tell you I am almost mad myself To think how soon I may be stripped of all; And then forsooth to fling away your jewels, As if you thought I had no use for money, At such a time as this is. Ada. Oh, my father! Have we fought, bled, lost everything for Carthage? Gis. Come, come, no more of this. I've no more time For prating now, for I must to the senate. And as for youâwhy, keep your jewels, child. Ada. Oh, I will find some way to serve my country! Zilla! [She claps her hands.] Enter Zilla. Zil. Here am I, lady. Ada. My veil, Zilla! And come with me into the balcony, For I will sit there to see Hannibal. [She passes into the balcony with Zilla.] Zil. Heavens! What a sea of faces! What a silence! Ada. Ah, what a world of sorrow there below us! Zil. Hear'st thou that murmur running through the crowd? See, see, they turn their faces all one way! He must be comingâsurely he is coming! Yes, there he is! Already I can see himâ There, at the furthest end of the long street, Where the great crowd is parting to receive himâ There! there! 'Tis he that slowly rides along Between two others. Oh, this must be he! Now, lady! [Hannibal and a small band of horsemen are seen to enter the street below. The people fling themselves before him with loud cries.] See, he bendsâhe speaks to them! Ada. Hush, hush! [Hannibal ceases to speak, and passes on amid a general silence.] Zil. Ah me, poor souls, they weep, yet still Follow him with their weeping eyes! Look, look! He turns toward us! What a dark, sad brow! Ada. 'Tis the stern sadness of a god dethroned. Zil. How they do press around him! How they seem To draw a comfort from the least glimpse of him! They're streaming after him! What, are these all That's left of his great army? Ada. We have him. Zil. Now, lady, now we have seen Hannibal! Ada. Oh, silence, Zilla, that I still may seem To hear his low voice roll along the air, Like music at a martial funeral! What have I seen? What image have received From the long passionate regard of eyes, Blind with their own intensity of vision? I know notâfor that form has blotted out The picture painted in my soul before, But leaves me no new picture in its placeâ For I was dazzled, and I could not see him. My dream is vanishedâI have lost th'ideal, And yet I find not the reality. It may be that the Hannibal I saw Was nobler than the Hannibal I fancied; And even now, as his voice, heard no more, Speaks to me more distinctly through the silence, So, through the void his parted presence leaves, Memory begins to trace a clearer shape, Than that which passed in very deed before meâ That martial strangeness as of foreign lands, All the proud past still burning in his eyes, Through the dark shadow of a solemn pity, And the strong patience of a hero's grief, Pathetic in its very awfulness. But life is changed, for ever changed, for me! Now shall I never lay me down, nor wake, Without remembering Carthage holds her hero; And I no longer am alone on earth! [She withdraws into the house.] Scene XIX. âScipio's camp at Tunes. His tent, into which enter Scipio and LÃ¦lius. Scip. The Carthaginian deputies, I guess, Are here, as I appointed? LÃ¦l. Even so; And much, I doubt me, troubled in their mind, With expectation of their interview. The poor men have awaited you some days. As for the soldiers, they no whit refrained From jeers and tauntings at the sight of them. Scip. I shall not keep them now much longer waiting. But I must dine first, ere I give them audience. LÃ¦l. Doubtless you had a joyous voyage hither? Scip. I told you, did I not, I turned aside Into their pleasant harbour, and surveyed The city at my leisure? There it was, The galley which conveyed these deputies Met me all wreathed about with olive boughs. I bade them meet me here, and so passed on. LÃ¦l. I doubt 'tis long since they have come to dinner With such a hearty appetite as yours. Scipio, shall it be vain once more to urge That which in council you have overruled? May I not once more tell you, there are those Will blame you that you have admitted Carthage Too easily to terms? I will be bold To say, you rob yourself of half your glory; And it may be, that after-times will think In this you too much followed Hannibal, Whose lingerings after CannÃ¦ saved our Rome. Scip. If Rome was saved so, I ne'er knew as much. LÃ¦l. If I were Scipio, I should scarce be glad To come to Rome with nothing but a treaty, Instead of marching glorious through the streets, With the great spoil of Carthage. Scip. I shall have Wherewith to triumph nobly, as it is, In the brave pageant I shall show to Rome. Not but in Sophonisba I have lost Its rarest ornament. LÃ¦l. And yet there are As fair as she, still hidden from the day, In all the gorgeous palaces of Carthage. Pass but the city gates, and you may choose As many of these beauties as you will, To dazzle Rome with in your hour of triumph. To lead the daughters of the land in chains, To offer up to Jove Capitoline Censors and flagons torn from Moloch's altar, Would be the crowning glory after Zama. With one hand might you point and say, Behold The spoils I took from Hannibal's own camp! And with the other, Lo, the sack of Carthage! If this nought moves you, would you not desire To punish to the uttermost extreme The long o'erweening pride of Hannibal, Which, for requital, should have nothing less Than the entire extinction of his state? Scip. My greedy rivals will not wait for that; The envious fathers that did first oppose My coming hither, are already restless With haste to send me out my successor. I should be superseded long before The painful siege of Carthage were achieved. This business, to be well accomplished, must Be soon accomplished. I'll not trust another; For Hannibal is there to forge despair Into a deadly weapon of resistance. I choose to think I am the man, by fate Designed, to put him down, and mean to bit His fiery ambition whilst I may, Nor run the risk that some unpractised hand May let it go unbridled hence again. Enter an Attendant. Go, bring those Carthaginians to my presence. [Exit Attendant, and re-enter with the Carthaginian Deputies. Scip. You, sirs, it seems, are those your senate sends With her submission? 1st Dep. Noble Scipio, yes. Scip. I have not yet forgot a former day When some of you on a like embassy, And with a like abasement, sought my camp. Nor have I yet forgotten that which followed My ready acquiescence in their prayer. 2nd Dep. Most noble Scipio, then forget it now; Or but remember it to enhance your triumph, That so you may the more incline to mercy. Scip. Let me, in brief, hear what you have to say. 1st Dep. This only, Scipio, that we beg for peace! Upon your clemency we fling ourselves In utter failure of all other hope. We own we have been wrong from first to last; Wrong in the first beginning of the war, Misled by Hannibal's ambition and Hereditary hate; and, lastly, wrong In breaking through the truce you granted us In our late terror. Yet have mercy now! For we are humbled to the dust before you! Oh, be contented with earth's greatest triumph! You have already surpassed Hannibalâ Stay, then, your hand, nor urge us to despair! Scip. I am aware, sirs, this will ever be The fashion of your nation, insolent In their success, and abject in defeat; And, lastly, quick to break the promises Through fear extorted. 2nd Dep. What then shall we say? How further shall we humble ourselves before you? Scip. I have fixed my part already, wholly moved By my own will and pleasure, by regard To the uncertainty of human greatness And to the sovereign dignity of Rome, To me this day committed; not at all By anything that you have said to me, Or any pity for deserved misfortune. I mean to spare your city; on what terms You shall hear from me in yon inner chamber. Await me there one instant. I will follow. [The Deputies pass within.] Think you these men are enough humbled, LÃ¦lius? LÃ¦l. Ay, for a time; but once your sword withdrawn, They will break out in curses. Wait and see What then shall follow. Clemency is wasted On hounds like these. Scip. Well, they shall now learn from me How great is this same clemency you speak of. Pray you, if Masanissa comes, receive him With kindly welcome. [Scipio passes within.] Enter Octavius. Oct. How fares Scipio, pray thee, After his voyage? LÃ¦l. Marvellously well. But that he is somewhat sunburned, I can see No change in him after his victory. He is within there, with those Carthaginians, Giving them lessons of humility. Vainly I urged him to deny them peace, And instantly begin the siege of Carthage. Oct. He knows his business best. He has subdued And humbled Hannibal, has crushed his Carthage, And won himself a triumph. He may rest. LÃ¦l. I dare not hope they will be mad enough, Though Hannibal should urge, to spurn these terms. Oct. If it be madness, Hannibal himself Will save them from it; and if he resists, Hard is the task before us; though I know Thou burn'st to drive the ploughshare o'er the ashes Of Esmun's temple and Hamilcar's palace. LÃ¦l. If a true lasting peace is to be looked for, The foremost article insisted on Should have been this same Hannibal's surrender. Oct. Nay, base and pitiful as Carthage is, It were impossible that even she Should, whilst the breath is left in her, abandon The man in whom alone she can find helpâ The man whose life has been devoted to her; Cruel, perfidious, mischievous to Rome, But faithful to his country. LÃ¦l. On which country He has brought utter ruin. Re-enter Deputies and pass out. Oct. These, I think, Have scarcely found our Scipio too forgiving! Re-enter Scipio. Scip. I greet thee well, Octavius. Oct. And I thee. Scip. Thou smilest, LÃ¦lius. LÃ¦l. As I stood but now, By the tent-door, I heard the soldiers mock Those hapless deputies. One said, âPoor souls! Has Scipio soundly buffeted their ears To teach them manners?â And anotherâHa! In good time; here comes the Numidian king. Enter Masanissa. Scip. I greet thee heartily, King Masanissa! How fares thy wound? Mas. That wound has ceased to pain me. Scip. Then, has thy soul a wound? Mas. More than one, Scipio. Scip. I know that his escape has troubled you. Mas. It had been better far that he had left His proud heart's blood upon the field of Zama. Scip. For us, assuredly. Yet he, methinks, Did well to live after his great defeat. I know our Roman heroes are ashamed To outlive their calamities; and I, Perhaps, myself had followed the old fashion, If his case had been mine. Yet Hannibal, Having done all that lay in man, before And during battle, to insure success, Did surely act more nobly not to sink Under a shame, his fate, not his deserts, Procured him. Mas. Scipio, 'twill be found that Rome Shall have no peace nor safety whilst he lives, Nor whilst his city stands on her foundations. Scip. His city stands, indeed; but such a State, So maimed, so crushed, can only serve to us For a perpetual triumph, and to you. You may content your hatred whilst you live, With seeing your proud enemy abased, And with the thought of all that you have done, By your own arms, to bring her down thus low.â Tell me, I pray you, did you recognize Your friends amongst those Punic deputies? Mas. Not one, but I remembered face and name. LÃ¦l. I guessed as much, Octavius, by his eye, When he came into us. It was not loving. Scip. 'Tis time to make the circuit of the camp. I pray you, friends, give me your company. [Exeunt omnes. Scene XX. âThe Senate of Carthage. Senators pouring in confusedly. Enter Gisco, Bostar, &amp;c. 1st Sen. I scarce could make my way here, for the crowd. Do you know anything? 2nd Sen. No more than youâ That Scipio grants us peaceâon what conditions, It sickens me to guess. 1st Sen. They say the twelve Showed in the streets such faces of despair, The mob were thunderstruck. 2nd Sen. What's to do now? If Hannibal and all his warlike faction Renounce at last the struggle in despair, What's left but to give Scipio all he asks? And what will he not ask? 1st Sen. Wise young Bomilcar, Who frets for ever for the good old times, In all societies gives out forsooth, We suffer simply for the nation's sins; So he and his young converts go about, And preach that all we need is to restore The human sacrifice. In former days, As they remind us, in all great reverses, Moloch had human victims for a bribe, And then a blessing fell upon our doings. 3rd Sen. There's one such victim might at least bribe Rome. But if they think so, let them lead the way. Let their young wives come with their sweetest smiles, To lay their infants on those brazen arms; Well kissed and petted, they will give no trouble, And Moloch, we are told, likes merry victims; And then their purple dresses look so well. I warrant you there are old priests yet left, Would gladly put on scarlet, and go heat The furnace up to roaring. Tell him so. 4th Sen. I heard to-day another doctrine preached; 'Twas by that Hebrew slave with the white beardâ A captive here they say these forty yearsâ Whom on the temple steps we see so oft, In sullen silence sitting, hour by hour. This day at last he lifted up his voice, And cried, âWoe to the worshippers of Baal!â And as he spoke, methought his eyes glared curses. 5th Sen. Thou hadst done well there to have smote him dead. Enter the two Suffetes, followed by the twelve Deputies. Hark! Hark! Hear you the shouting of the mob? Be sure 'tis Hannibal. Enter Hannibal. Is this the air, With which a conquered general takes his place? Bost. The evil genius of the land, returned To look upon the ruin he has wrought! 5th Sen. He gazes round him, like a banished king Surveying from his car reconquered subjects, And choosing out his victims. 6th Sen. Rather, say A lion from the wilderness, for once Compelled amongst the haunts of men to seek A refuge from the mighty hunter's dartsâ And finding them as strange as they find him. [Silence is proclaimed.] 1st Suff. Senate of Carthage! we salute you all! In sackcloth and in ashes we are met, This woefulest of all the days of woe, That yet have fallen on Carthage, since the first Beginning of these long and ill-starred wars. Rome has prevailed. At Scipio's feet we lie Prostrate, and on his pleasure we depend. What shall I say more? Hannibal himself Has bid us beg for peace. Enough. You know The strait wherein we stand. Know then, to-day Has Scipio's answer been received by us, Who, with the hundred elders of the State, Now deem it fitting to appeal once more To the united voice of this assembly, The Senate and nobility of Carthage. Hear, then, the terms on which he grants us peace, Whose legions at our very threshold waitâ Whilst Hannibal amongst us stands within, Without an army, without hope or help, Save his great name and fame. Now, sir, do you Repeat to this assembly what you are charged with. 1st Dep. These are the terms: âCarthage must make amends For all the injuries to Romans done, Pending the truce with Scipioâmust restore All prisoners and desertersâmust give up All her war-galleys, saving only tenâ Likewise her elephants, with promise given To train no new ones for the line of battleâ Must wage no war beyond the bounds of Afric, Nor any war without consent of Romeâ Must yield to Masanissa all that he Or any of his fathers have possessedâ Must feed the Roman army for three months, And pay it until it be carried homeâ Must pay each year for fifty years to come, To Rome, a tribute of two hundred talentsâ And give one hundred hostages to Rome, Betwixt the ages of fifteen and thirty, To be selected at her general's pleasure.â These are the terms by his own lips set forth. [A loud and confused murmur from the assembly.] 2nd Suff. Upon these terms, it seemeth, senators, May Carthage be permitted to exist, A miserable mockery of herself, Till Rome think fit to blot her image out For ever from the earth. Senators. [Speaking confusedly together.] Must we bear this? O Moloch, must we bear it?âCurst be Scipio! What does he think the neck of Carthage made of, That he should lay on it a yoke like this?â What, by the gods, must we be yielded up, Bound hand and foot, after this sort, to Rome, To be first plundered, and then hewn in pieces?â Children and moneyâall to go together! Is this the end, O Baal? Gis. 'Tis too much! If Scipio takes away my money from me, He may go take my daughter for a hostage, For aught I care. As good be dead at once, As have our blood drawn from us, drop by drop! [Mounts the tribune.] I, for one, senators, will ne'er consent To this iniquity. I do lift up My voice against it, and I call on you, I say, on all of you, here presentâ Han. Silence! [He drags Gisco from the tribune, amidst loud exclamations.] 2nd Suff. For shame! Dost thou treat thus a senator, And elder of thy city? Gis. By what right, Dar'st thou cut short my speaking? Han. Pardon me, My countrymen and fellow-citizens. I do not know the usages of Carthage. I left you, four-and-thirty years ago, A child, for the rude company of soldiers, And all that time have been too busy fighting To learn good manners. I will mend my fault, Trust me, before I go to war again; But meanwhile hear me patiently this once, And let me speak my thoughts upon this matter, Wherein I pray you to believe e'en I May have some small concern. First Suff. Speak on! We hear thee. Han. I say, then, fellow-citizens of Carthage, We have no choice, and must accept these terms. I say it, for I stand before you, vanquished Not merely in a battle, but a war. Our army is destroyed, nor have we means To raise another. We have no alliesâ Too much our neighbours hate us, for a hope Of any help from others in a siege, E'en were the dread of Scipio less prevailing. Our citizens have not been trained to war, To danger, nor to hardship. We have long Dealt out these evils upon other lands, Which, when brought home, we have no strength to bear, Having neglected to provide for them. The terms which Scipio offers us this day Are hard, but may be better borne, I think, Than instant and entire extermination. We must accept them; yet, I say, take courage, And make such sternly patient use of peace, That we may hope to stand in arms once more, Still strong with hate, and wiser from defeat. For me, I swear to spend those energies I hitherto have lavished on your wars, In building up your strength and hopes at home. If, therefore, as I think, I may have earned Some right to claim my country's confidence, By old successes, even though I stand This day before you, as a conquered man, You will, like me, hold out against despair. This is my counselârather say your fate. First Suff. Ye have heard Hannibal. Too true it is, 'Tis madness but to whisper of resistance. He tells you so, who has tried Rome so long, And knows her better far than you or I; He calls for prudenceâshall we counsel rashness? He bids us hope, and shall we then despair? Sen. Alas! alas! To this, then, war has brought us! Bereaved, impoverished, shamed!âA Libyan boy, A false Numidian, raised to rival us!â Two hundred talents! Hear it, ghost of Dido!â Was't not enough he treads us to the dust, And must he rob us of our all besides? Gis. Temple of Hercules! for fifty years! Woe, woe, is us! The substance we have heaped With so much toil together! Luxury And splendour, such as far outdazzled Tyre! A day of tears indeed! Who shall not weep? By all the gods, thou smilest, Hannibal! Second Suff. Smilest thou o'er the country thou hast ruined? Han. Your pardon, sirs! Could hearts be read like faces, Then might you read in mine such shame for you, As sheds no tears but tears of blood within. Weep, if you will, thenânot for Zama's slain, Not for your children to be torn from you, Not for your standards trailed through Rome in triumph, Not for your war-ships which made Carthage great, Not for your elephants which made Rome tremble, Not for your ruined majesty in Africâ Weep not for these, but for your paltry purses; And let me laugh, who cannot weep with you. First Suff. If any man rejects the terms of Scipio, Let him lift up his hand. Not one. Be it resolved We send an embassy with our submission. [The Senate breaks up.] Scene XXI. âThe assembly of the people at Carthage in the market-place. Enter the Suffetes, Gisco, Bomilcar. After them enter Hannibal. First Suff. People of Carthage! We have called you here Upon a business which concerns all Carthage. Some of our elders are prepared this day To claim your judgments on a most grave charge Against your sometime general, Hannibal. Gisco, deliver what you have to say. Gis. [Mounting the tribune.] Good people of the city! Well you knowâ Nor need I to remind youâin what plight Our country stands. You know that we are conquered, Insulted, trampled on, by Rome and Scipio. We have no army, scarce a territory; We are bereaved, impoverished, plundered, ruined; We are a jest to all the nations round! Who, then, is he to whom we owe all this? There stands the man! Methinks he should be much Ashamed to look this people in the face! But we can see no humbleness in him. Does any man forget how we have been Wont, heretofore, to deal with those vile bunglers, Whose shameful failures have disgraced the State? Have we been wont to raise them to high places, Or have we given them the death of a dog? [Loud murmurs are heard amongst the audience. Gisco descends from the tribune, and Bostar takes his place.] Bos. People of Carthage! I beseech you be not Cheated by loud professions or vain shows. This Hannibal pretends to be your friend, And calls himself a mighty generalâ How is it, then, that he has ruined us? 'Tis true that fifteen years ago he won What all his friends called a great victory. But did it conquer Rome for us? Did Rome Send, after CannÃ¦, to sue him for peace, As we, forced by his shameful overthrow At Zama, sued to Scipio? By no means. 'Tis true, his boastful Mago at our feet Showered down a goodly heap of golden ringsâ The spoil, he told us, of slain Roman knights; That much we got by CannÃ¦! For the rest, Whilst all his flatterers, for fifteen years, Have talked so big of his prodigious doings, And he, with ceaseless importunity, Has begged for men, and money, and what not, Never has he been nearer, by a step, To the accomplishment of that great project He boasted of, ere yet he crossed the Alps. These sons of Barca have deluded you! 'Tis not so very long since Hasdrubal, Through his own rashness, and his brother's sloth, With all his army has been cut to pieces. Yet still, without a hope, without a plan, In Italy he lingered on and onâ And why? Because he dared not to come home, And face our just displeasure. Might we not At least have trusted that his presence on The soil of Italy would keep at home The arms of Scipio? Nay, but we were brought To ruin's very brink, whilst yet he dozed Beneath the pleasant skies of Bruttium. Well, What next? We send for himâhe lands at last; But in the place of marching night and day, To save his country in her imminent peril, He suffers us, with oft-repeated instance, To urge his swift advance; yet tarries on, Day after day, whilst Scipio over-runs Our country, and takes all our towns from us, And his own rude unruly hirelings treat Our lovely land like conquered Italy. At last he changes wavering for rashness, Refusesâmark meâScipio's moderate termsâ For Scipio, you shall know, then offered peaceâ Stakes all upon one field, and loses it! People of Carthage, I denounce this man, To all your faces, as a traitor to you! Adjudge him, people, to a traitor's death! [Confused and contradictory clamours arise. Bomilcar takes Bostar's place in the tribune.] Bom. O people, how the gods groan over us! They see us shamed, betrayed by him we trusted,â That broken reed, that reed which stabs the hand! They call us to reject our ruiner, The demon that beguiled us, our land's curse, The plague that has afflicted us to death! Their wrath is on us, whilst we suffer him To lift his proud head unrebuked before us! Oh, hear the loud cry of those holy priests Who, prostrate at the altars, night and day, Fast, weep, and pray for their lost land in vain! They bid us yield their victim to the gods. Give the great gods their victim! Whilst he lives They suffer pain; they wreak their pain on us, Who cling to our destruction and our death. Wake from your dream! Do as our fathers did, Surrender to the gods their sacrifice, And send the mighty traitor to his doom! Peo. [Shouting clamorously.] Hannibal! Speak for thyself! Gis. [To Bostar.] Ah, ha! we knew them wellâthe same for him As all the rest! Now let him rue his Zama! Han. People of Carthage! You have heard all this These men have found to charge me with this day. Judge for yourselves if they have reason with them! Judge for yourselves if they have lied, or no! I will not set my knowledge against theirs. Doubtless, whilst they have sat at home at peace, They have learnt all that books and talk could teach them About that art of war which I, alas! In the rude soldier-fashion of my father, Have only studied on the battle-field. But let that pass. 'Tis true that I am conquered; True, for twelve hours I fought for you at Zama, And for twelve hours at Zama fought in vainâ True, for twelve hours I saw, one after one, The bravest soldiers and the dearest friends That ever man has mourned for, perish round meâ True, on the twelfth I saw my life's hope blasted, Scipio victorious, and my country fallen! On me then fall the blameâto me ascribe, If it so please you, all that you have suffered, And let these enemies that, year by year, Have sought to ruin me, stand clear this day. They hate me, so does Rome. Long as I live, Nor they, nor Rome, will know a moment's peace; Do them and Rome a pleasure, then, this day! But by the souls of those we slew at CannÃ¦, And by my father's soul, I swear to you, And by the souls of Hasdrubal and Mago, Carthage will, in the last son of my father, Lose the last friend of Carthage! Here I stand, then! There stand mine enemies! Give them their answer; And if one voice cry, âDown with Hannibal!â Let the whole city lead me to my doom! [The assembly breaks out into loud cries of âLong live Hannibal!â âDown with his enemies!â âWe will not put it to the vote.â] Han. I thank you. I will profit by your trust To make both you, and my own heart, amends For my disaster as a general, By my good service as a citizen. [Exit. Gis. [To Bomilcar and Bostar.] Foiled utterly! We had best take our leave. Now for a revolution in the State! Now for mob government! Bom. Let us be gone, And get back home as quietly as may be. [The assembly breaks up, a vast crowd flocking after Hannibal, with shouts.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âA gallery in the house of Gisco. Enter Gisco and a Senator. Sen. Oh, what a devil we have brought home to us, With a high hand to overthrow the State! What's this strange talk of his about reform? Gis. Reform, indeed! An idiotic word, That ne'er was heard amongst us till this man, That would be wiser than his grandsires, comes To pull those ancient institutions down Which had, methinks, worked well enough for them, Which Aristotle praised, which made us great, And can alone restore us to our greatness. Sen. A mere pretext for keeping up his power, By winning favour with the common peopleâ Gis. He calls it by that fine name, patriotism. But we will not be governed by the peopleâ Thank heaven, we still have means to keep them down! Oh, it enrages me to see that man Play traitor to his order in this fashion, To feed the grasping cravings of ambition. And now, his ruinous defeat still fresh, Comes this audacious talk about abusesâ This censorship of all our public menâ Charges 'gainst this and that man of corruptionâ Odium brought down upon the magistrates, And old-established profits cut away, Till we, the merchant-princes of the sea, Whose state and splendour in our way of life, From Gades to PhÅnicia is renowned, Forsooth, must part with our magnificence, Our daughters lack their portions, and our sons No longer hold their State amongst the people, Like sons of kings, as heretofore hath been; And all because a conquered general, After mishaps for which as worthy men Have suffered, and less justly, crucifixion, Usurps a station at our council-board, And helps, forsooth, to govern us! Well, well, The times are changed, I think, when we reward Those that have ruined us. Sen. Why, by the gods, Could we not rid us of this pest before? The last and hatefulest of all his houseâ A far worse enemy than Rome herself! I would Rome had him! Gis. Ay, and wherefore not? Tell me now, have you guessed these Roman envoys Come with a secret errand, other than That they have openly professedâth'adjustment Of this our difference with King Masanissa? Sen. I had some faint suspicions, I will own. Gis. And have you stretched conjecture far enough To guess what is that errand? Sen. Ay, thus far, As that it touches Hannibal. Gis. It does. Within this very hour I seek the envoys To treat with them upon this very matter. We had sent them private hints that Hannibal Was treating with Antiochus already For a fresh league 'gainst Rome. That was enough. Straight come these legates on their secret mission. Sen. What, to demand that we expel him? Gis. More. Sen. That we should give him up to Rome? Gis. E'en so. Sen. By heaven! How face the fury of the mob? You had almost been stoned for his dear sake When you stepped forth so boldly to impeach him! Gis. Oh, never fearâthey love themselves too well, Not to prefer his loss, once out of sight, To what we'll tell them we are threatened with By Rome's displeasureâsiege and massacre, And what notâhanging o'er our heads through him. But done it must beâay, and speedily. The council is unanimous; already They've held their secret meeting in the Temple, This business to decide; and nought remains But to achieve the seizure. Sen. Are you sure That he has no suspicion? Gis. None as yet; He has shown himself in public fearlessly This very day, and courteously saluted The Roman legates. Oh, he guesses nothing! But he must not be left another day To find it out. Sen. Ah! on this very night, then! Gis. This very night. By midnight we shall send A force sufficient to surround his house, And bear down all resistance so surprised. The Roman galleys in the inner harbour Are ready to receive him, and set sail Ere break of day, with the long wished-for prize. Sen. I scarcely shall breathe freely till 'tis done. He's better out of Carthageâyes, much better. We never can be friends with Rome, so long As he is known to sway in our state councils. They will not trust us. Gis. Nay, how should they? Now, 'Tis in our power to give convincing proof Of our desire to win their confidence. Therefore it must and shall be done. To-morrow Will see us rid of our worst enemy, And able to lie down at night in peace. Come, it is time I should go seek the legates;â Will you accompany my going thither? [Exeunt Gisco and Senator. Zil. [Entering from behind a curtain.] My lady shall know this! What will she say? I think she'll weep, for sure she worships him. [Exit. Scene II. âOne of the principal streets of Carthage, crowded with chariots, elephants, horsemen, and foot passengers, &amp;c. Enter Ada and Zilla disguised, carrying flowers. Ada. Oh, this great crowded street! Zil. Take courage, lady! There's no one here takes you for what you are. Would you but step a little boldlier forth! The common people do not move so softly, Nor look so terrified at every man That brushes past them. Ada. Zilla, we are lost! Surelyâyes, surelyâ'tis my father yonder, Coming towards us with three other men? Zil. 'Tis he, indeed. Should he discover us, For me, at very least, the scourge and dungeon, And for thee, ladyâ Ada. Hush, O Zilla, hush! We will but think of what we came to do. Where shall we turn to? Zil. Slip beneath this archwayâ He'll never notice us. Would he dream, think you, That two poor flower-girls in the public streets Could be his daughter and her handmaid? Ah, Here he comes, lady! Sure enough, 'tis he! What stately foreigners are these with him? Ada. The Romans, doubtless. Oh, my blood runs cold! Zil. He looks half cowed amongst his stern companions, And 'tis no wonder, sure. Enter Gisco and the Roman Legates, passing in front of the archway. Gis. This street we count Our noblest. Doubtless, sirs, your city boasts As splendid thoroughfares? 1st Leg. Our city's boast Is in the men that walk them. Gis. In your streets The various dresses, languages, and products Of other lands, we here encounter daily, Would be a wonder, doubtless? 2nd Leg. We behold them, When conquering generals enter Rome in triumph. [Gisco and the Roman Legates pass on.] Zil. Now we are safe! Now thou may'st come forth, lady. Didst thou not tremble at those haughty strangers, Lest they should find us out? One scowl of theirs Had scattered all my wits. Ada. I scarce can stand; Yet know not if I trembled most for fear Or for abhorrence. Let me but take breath. ... And now I will go on. Our time is short. [Exeunt Ada and Zilla. Scene III. âThe house of Hannibal. A spacious hall, supported on pillars, from which a crowd of petitioners, &amp;c., have just departed. Hannibal alone pacing slowly up and down. Han. I would have saved themâit was not too late; I would have healed their weaknessâthere was time; But now 'tis over, and I must begone. Enough! I've seen my father's house once more, And found it coldly empty of the past In all its stately, long-deserted space. Am I the child that left it long ago, Who now walk in a city of a dream, Like one whose term of days by miracle Is stretched beyond the natural life of man, Who sees familiar generations die, And stands a living statue of the past? I have no friend in Carthage, save myself, Nor elsewhere any friend. On Zama's field I've left the last who loved me; happier they, Than I who live without them. What of that? What if the fiery iron of my soul Must now grow cold? 'Twas hammered on the forge Of destiny into a lasting shape, And will not mould again. Thou know'st it, thou, Hamilcar! that hast given three sons to Carthage! Two of thy gifts are rendered back to thee, But, oh! salute not yet thy Hannibal. Father, my vow still chains me to the world, And Rome and I must not part company. [An attendant's voice without.] Pass in, and You will find my lord alone. [Ada and Zilla pass in through the pillars at the further end, and pause a moment.] Zil. [whispers.] 'Tis he himself! He paces, look! with arms Folded. Oh, and now he has seen us, lady! See, he approaches! God of light, what eyes! Han. I am he whom you seek. Speak your petition. [Zilla withdraws.] Ada. O Hannibal! Han. Speak on, and fear not, lady. If, as I guess, thou art not what thou seem'st, Tell me what danger calls for this disguise? Ada. I cannot speak. .. Oh, pardon me, my lord! .. I am the daughter of thine enemyâ Would he were not so!âAda, Gisco's daughterâ But do not, do not for that cause mistrust me! Han. It would be strange could I mistrust that face. Speak freely, ladyâI but wait thy words. Ada. Indeed, 'tis life and death! You are betrayed! Our council has betrayed you to the Romans! You know not that these envoys have in truth A secret charge to claim your own surrender. This very day a plot is laid with them At midnight to surround you in this house, And to the Roman galleys yield you up, Now anchored in the harbour. O my lord! Do not despise my taleâbeseech you do not. .. Since, with a shame that I must bear till death, I own it was my father's lips revealed This treason in my watchful handmaid's ears. Pardon the traitor, but oh, save yourself! Han. Thanks, my true friend. You tell me what I know; When Rome and Carthage meet to plot together, 'Tis easy guessed what man they plot against; But I perceive, by that which you have told me, My foes are not disposed to let time slip, And I must hasten what I have to do. Ada. Oh, place yourself in safety, then!ânow, now! My lord, lose not a moment. Han. There is time; And if there were not, I have means to die. But tell me, do you put yourself in danger? Will not your absence be discovered? Ada. No; My faithful Zilla has planned all for me. I have passed safely through my greatest danger.â May I dare ask what refuge you will seek. With whom take shelter? Han. With Antiochus. Ada. Whatâand leave Carthage? Thou wilt leave us, leave us! Han. YesâI have taken counsel with my soul; To serve my country, I have now no choice, But to fly from her. Ada. Leave us! Wilt thou leave us? How shall we live without thee? Not for everâ Say not for ever! Say thou wilt come back! Han. That must depend upon Antiochus. If, as I little doubt, his plenitude Of royal condescension will exalt Rome's enemy to his high council table, I yet may live to strike a blow for Carthage. Ada. And is it thus all heroes are rewarded? Oh, that the lords of Carthage felt like me! Why sprang I from a lineage I must blush for? Han. There is in thee that which might well redeem The baseness of a hundred generations; Let not the burden of such earthiness Weigh down a spirit so ethereal. Ada. What can I do for Carthage? Han. Still remain That which thou art, noble, and pure, and trueâ So best thou honourest and serv'st thy country; And so, the deep shame of the final ruin Shall brand no burning stains upon thy conscience. And as for meâif ever I again Sit in my country's councils, or at least May be permitted, from my place of exile, To deal once more some deadly hurt to Rome, I shall remember who it was who came To save me one hope from the wreck of all. Ada. O Hannibal! of such an hour as this, How from my childhood I have dreamed and dreamed. That I, that I should serve thee! Han. Were I still The lord of thousands that held Rome in terror, Be sure, with no more thankfulness of soul, Would I owe life and liberty to thee, Than now when life and liberty are all That I am lord of. Ada. Oh, and what will be The fate of Carthage? Han. Wherefore dost thou ask? The first words of her sentence are pronouncedâ May I not hear the last! Ada. Yet save us! save us! Han. Not from the farthest East will I forget you! In house and field, in palace and in camp, Fasting and feasting, waking or in sleeping, I'll know no joy nor sorrow, save for Carthage. Heart, brain, and arm shall work their last for her, Ere in a wintry night of disappointment The one dear hope, first kindled in my childhood, For ever and for ever be extinguished. Ada. Tell me how that dear hope was kindled first! Each word thou utterest, I shall treasure up. Han. What, must I tell thee of my childhood, Ada? Like other childhoods it was rich in dreams, Ripened by ripening manhood into hopes, And crossed in middle age. Ada. Yet tell me more! Thy childhood never could have been like others! How wert thou made that which thou hast become? Han. It was my happy fortune to be snatched, In those first plastic years when minds are moulded, From the soft pleasures of a Punic home. Ada. Thy motherâsister? Han. Were, and are but dreams. My mother, from my father's austere worship, In her soft youth had vanished goddess-likeâ My scarce-known sister lived to be a bride, Then soared in splendour from the world away. The women of my race were formed of fire Too subtle to burn long in grosser air; The men were left to sterner destinies. I am no Carthaginian in my nurture; Reared on the stormy battle-fields of Spain, My childhood grew to youth beneath the blaze Of great examples; heroes were my friends, And in the whirl of action, victory And danger tracing out his path before himâ Still fierce and brilliant as his name of Lightning, My father in his terrors flashed before me; Yet oft as he could make a green oasis Of rest around us, softened into love. That was the love which vivifies the soul It breathes on, and exalts it into purpose. Him too I had, that other Hasdrubal, The gentle, noble husband of my sister; And then my brothersâas their childhood grew, They followed next, to the stern school of Spain, And drank from the same fount of living fire, That to a burning manhood nurtured me. Those were my lovesâno treacherous tenderness, With sad division, pleaded 'gainst esteemâ I never loved the heart I could not honour. E'en in the vivid summer of my life, When beauty dazzled fancy into passion, My soul has turned away unsatisfied, To lay its homage on austerer shrines. But all of those I worshiped in my youth, Hamilcar and his house, one after one, All save myself, have perished by the sword. Ada. Oh, thou wert left, that mission to accomplish, For which their holy lives were offered up! Han. Ada, since thou hast asked me of my childhood, My heart is inly moved to tell thee that I never yet have told to living earsâ The first, the holiest secret of my lifeâ So much the wistful fervour of thine eyes Is answered by the deep trust of my soul. Ada. How shall I thank thee? Speak on, I beseech thee. Han. Thou knowest, perhaps, that I was but a child, When to those Spanish wars that were his last, My fatherâto unwilling peace with Rome By evil fate constrainedâfor the last time, Sailed from his country's harbour. Ere he parted, He held a solemn public sacrifice To all the gods of Carthage. I was present, That day, with all his household. By my side, I well remember, stood my infant brothers; We, the three lion-whelps my father vowed To rear for Rome's destruction, stood together, And watched with childish curiosity, And childish reverence, the sacred rites. And well, too, I remember how I thought The mighty music, which at every pause Came pealing out of darkness, was the voice Of all the gods, calling us forth to war, And guessed how anxiously my father's heart Must thrill and swell within him to obey it. The victim slainâthe omens found propitiousâ The sacred offering on the altar laidâ And, lastly, the libation duly poured By his own hand upon the sacrificeâ My father, on a sudden, turning him To his armed captains that around him stood, Bade them withdraw themselves a little space, And called me, through the silence, with a voice Whose half-stern pathos still I seem to hear, To stand beside him. Then, in tones so low That no one else could catch the words he spake, He asked me, would I go with him to Spain? Instantly, with a childish eagerness, I prayed that he would take me to the wars. Thereat, with something too of a sad smile, To hear my answer, did he bid me lay My hand upon the altar, and there swear Never to cease from hatred of the Romans. That moment formed my futureâlaughing childhood, Bowing to a religious destiny, Felt its wild fancies cluster round one theme. I swore, and never have forgot my vow; Then, least of all, when, in the hall of council, I called on Carthage to make peace with Rome. Not less my life's one burning vision then Glared on my soul, than on that other hour, When, at my feet, like a spent thunderbolt, Frowned the pale horror of my brother's head. Ada. O Hannibal! I wept, I wept for him. Alas! my lord, would I could comfort thee! Would I could die to bring thee back thy brother! Han. Not for the slain, the slain ones of my house, Not for Hamilcar, nor for Hasdrubal, Nor Mago, waste again those holy tears. I would not wish them to be living now. Yet foolish words!âhad he been living now, All this had never happened.âGods of Carthage! Did you, who look upon me now, inspire That summer-night dream, on the tented fieldâ The dream I dreamed in Spain, the golden Spain, That saw me glorious with a thousand hopes The dream which guided me like prophecy, Betwixt the sparkling turrets of the Alps, And through their white eternity of sleep? I never shuddered, in the chill sublime, Wherein strong soldier hearts did die away, And the great elephants like infants pined, Leaving their giant bones along my path, A sign for wondering ages yet to comeâ I gazed with love upon the cold, pale blue, That veiled the promised land; mine eyes did rove Through labyrinths of ice to seek the sun, And still I felt in spirit warm as if My own sweet south blew o'er me. 'Twas my dream, My lovely lying dream, by which the gods Set their own awful seal on my life's vowâ Lovely, and yet a lie. Ada. What was that dream? Han. My dream? A mere creation of my purpose, Which heard the message of the gods in sleep, No less than waking, with its breathless zeal, Listening for the least whisper of their will. 'Twas on the night after I left New Carthage, Flushed with my late won triumph o'er Saguntum, And marching for the Ebro. It was May, Just deepening into June; my sleeping camp Lay cradled in the shadow of the hills, And I, the last, slept too. 'Twas then, methought, The guardian deity of my father's house, With a subdued yet godlike exultation, Called me to enter the vast council hall Of all the gods of Carthage. There they sat, High on their thrones of State, pale presences, Sublime and silent as the mountain tops; But when I entered, broke from the whole throng, As with a trumpet-voice, their awful charge To fall on Italy with all my host. And one of them, methoughtâI knew not howâ Stepped forth to guide me. As I followed him, I heard him say, âSee thou look not behind.â And on I went, pursuing the clear star Of my far hope, till my impatient soul Broke through his bidding, and I looked behind. Ada. What saw'st thou, then? Han. In dreamlike imagery, That which I've seen since then with waking eyes; I saw the desolation of Italia. Shaped like a giant serpent, it rolled on, Swift, pitiless, resistless, o'er her fair Expanse of harvests; and, where'er it passed, A blurred and blotted picture of the land Lay grey behind me. But my guide cried out, âPass on thy way, and never look behind.â So have I done, through all my waking life, And what has come of it? Ada. And yet that life, So great, so changeful, and so marvellous, Must have been more than happy. Thou hast never Longed to turn backward? Han. Never. Ada. Oh, my lord! Time flies! The sun is setting! Han. The last sun That through my father's halls will shine on me! It lingers but to crown thy brow with fire. Ada. Waste not, no longer waste these hours of danger! Han. Fear not for me; take heed now for thyself. Ada. How soon, then, may I dare to think thee safe? Han. So soon as falls the darkness I take horse, The fleetest of my fleet Numidian steeds, And count on lighting, ere the dawn of day, At my own country mansion by the sea, At Thapsos. There must I take ship to Tyre, To Tyre, the fountain of our raceâto Tyre, The fallen mother of a fallen child; There, when mine eyes take their farewell of Afric, I will imagine that I hear thy voice Wish Hannibal good fortune in the East.â And now, what future, Ada, shall be thine? Young as thou art, child of mine enemy, I am proud, fair creature, thou art born of Carthage! But tell me, must I have to think of thee Enslaved by wedlock ties to any soul, So pitiful as these with whom thou livest? Be faithful to thy country; marry nobly, To be the star of all her matronhood, And mother of her heroes. Ada. Never! Never! I'll take no husband, whilst my country lives Widowed of hope, of glory, and of thee! Henceforth, a priestess to the temple vowed, I will devote my life, from morn till eve, To prayers, and tears, and sacrifice for theeâ Without one hope, save the dear thought of theeâ Han. Poor child! and if that visionary thought Should wed thee to vain hopes of my return, Still, o'er the long, long distance that divides us, Mine eyes shall seem, whene'er they turn to Carthage, To meet with thine, and we shall talk together; And, numbered now with his few precious things, The memory of these thy tears shall follow The heart of Hannibal to exile. Ada. Zillaâ Han. I have no gift wherewith to pay them back, Except my thanks ..... Ada. They shall be treasured up! Han. And this memorial of my happier days! This ringâof all the rings that Carthage bids Her soldiers wear for every year of war, The one I prize the mostâshall leave this finger, For Ada's sake, till I return to claim it. Ada. And thisâwhich year is this for? Han. 'Tis for CannÃ¦.â And now, upon one passionate parting moment, Worth a whole lifetime of the love that's wasted On a less perfect purity and beautyâ My soul must spend its all of tenderness, And never melt again. In this one kiss, A thousand, and a thousand times, I bless thee, Dear child! that weepest by thy country's grave, Rich in thy treasure of a noble sorrow, Which the base happy well might envy thee! And yet again I bless thee, that thou art The revelation of a womanhood I never thrilled to recognize till now! And so to that last tenderness farewell! That dear emotion which to-day has taught me All softness died not from my heart for ever, When my heart's love, my heart's own brother died!â And nowâyes, Ada ... Ada ... we must part! Farewell, beloved! and farewell to Carthage!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PRIESTESS'S VISION. Priestess, priestess! like a rosy flower, Planted in the gloom of Esmun's shrine! Hiding deep as in a cypress bower, All that glowing, grieving youth of thine! Priestess, priestess! silently and slow, Gliding from the cell of prophecies! Speakâwe tremble! What is this new woe? Whence the trouble in those startled eyes? Tell us what thou see'stâ Panting thus for breath?â Far off in the East, I am watching Death. Rome's revengeful hand Stretches o'er the land, To the great betrayed Exile, of long years, Whilst I hoped and prayed, With such useless tears!â Gazing all the while, Why that awful smile?â Rome will never hold him! Standing like a king, To his lips behold him Press the poisoned ring! Oh, the mighty heart, That I loved so well!â Wherefore dost thou start?â Like a god he fell. And hast thou passed into the hopeless land at last? Where is the awful purpose of thy soul, Which on and on, through unknown paths had gone, Pursuing still a still receding goal? Through what a glowing change of marvels did it range! What wailings, what rejoicings, shook the air! What white alarms, what welcome of stretched arms! What loss, what gain, what hate, what hope, and what despair! Not more enchanted ground the daring traveller found, Whose galleys followed, down the unknown West, Along the azure shine, a lurid lineâ Terrible beauty! Terrible unrest! An incense, like the spice of a great sacrifice, Perfumes, far out to sea, the burning air; Through walls of verdure, gloomily built up to the blue sky, Gleam the vast melancholy rivers there; Like nightmares of the flood, a monster brood Trample and rend rich nature, mile on mile; Beneath the splendid water, hungry for the slaughter, Gnashes fell jaws the ambushed crocodile; Through the rich gloom, and spiced entanglement of bloom, The lion glares, or grins the manlike ape; Though day groans to have done with the tyrannic sun, Yet cannot peace into dark night escape. The mountains send forth cries, fire flaunts along the skies, Fast to the revel the mad Ethiops come! The midnight game of demon dancers to proclaim, Storms out a din of cymbal, flute, and drum! So, round the path thou mad'st for thee, upstarted suddenly A world of horror, splendour, and uproar! Thy heart marched sternly through, till fate left nought to do; Then didst thou pause on the dark river's shore, Didst beckon death across, and wert beheld no more! How did hope betray thee, Once thy promised bride? Can the gods repay thee, Thus unsatisfied? What is lost on earth, Can the gods restore? Is thy great loss worth Grief for evermore? Will thine earthly story, With the past oppress thee, When the gods in glory Meet to crown and bless thee? Wilt thou walk apart, Choosing thine own doom, Eating thine own heart In eternal gloom? Wilt thou turn cold eyes On thy past despair, Wondering that the prize Should have seemed so fair? For that unpaid debt, Wilt thou cease to wait? Wilt thou quite forget Home, and hope, and hate? Should I bear to know How thy heart was changed? Should I know thee so, From the past estranged? Keep thy sacred sorrow Yet one day for me, So may I to-morrow Come to comfort thee! Now I fly to seek theeâshall I find thee? Wouldst thou leave my breaking heart behind thee? Shall impenetrable night divide thee, Shall an unguessed transformation hide thee From my pining soul for evermore beside thee? Vanish not into the dark so far, But that I may see thee like a star! Can it be? Can this cold hand be thine, Death, I feel so lightly clasping mine? Dim and distant, like a wordless hum, Now to me the world's great voices come. Far away I see a light, Far away I hear a sound; But all round me is the night, And a silence is all round! Phantoms fill the light with harplike din, Sweet aÃ«rial welcomings begin. Now my heart is broken! Let me in. THE END.</field>
