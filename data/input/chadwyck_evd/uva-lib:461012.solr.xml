      <field name="fulltext">KING VICTOR &amp; KING CHARLES; A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTE. So far as I know, this Tragedy is the first artistic consequence of what Voltaire termed âa terrible event without consequences;â and although it professes to be historical, I have taken more pains to arrive at the history than most readers would thank me for particularizing: since acquainted, as I will hope them to be, with the chief circumstances of Victor's remarkable European careerânor quite ignorant of the sad and surprising facts I am about to reproduce (a tolerable account of which is to be found, for instance, in AbbÃ© Roman's RÃ©cit, or even the fifth of Lord Orrery's Letters from Italy)âI cannot expect them to be versed, nor desirous of becoming so, in all the detail of the memoirs, correspondence, and relations of the time. From these only may be obtained a knowledge of the fiery and audacious temper, unscrupulous selfishness, profound dissimulation, and singular fertility in resources, of Victorâthe extreme and painful sensibility, prolonged immaturity of powers, earnest good purpose and vacillating will of Charlesâthe noble and right woman's manliness of his wifeâand the ill-considered rascality and subsequent better-advised rectitude of D'Ormea. When I say, therefore, that I cannot but believe my statement (combining as it does what appears correct in Voltaire and plausible in Condorcet) more true to person and thing than any it has hitherto been my fortune to meet with, no doubt my word will be taken, and my evidence spared as readily. R. B. London: 1842.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Victor Amadeus, first King of Sardinia. Charles Emmanuel, his son, Prince of Piedmont. Polyxena, wife of Charles. D'Ormea, minister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene.âThe Council Chamber of Rivoli Palace, near Turin, communicating with a Hall at the back, an Apartment to the left, and another to the right of the stage. Time, 1730â1731.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIRST YEAR, 1730.âKING VICTOR. Part I. Charles, Polyxena. Charles. You think so? Well, I do not. Polyxena. My beloved, All must clear up; we shall be happy yet: This cannot last for everâoh, may change To-day or any day! Charles. âMay change? Ah yesâ May change! Polyxena. Endure it, then. Charles. No doubt, a life Like this drags on, now better and now worse. My father may . . . may take to loving me; And he may take D'Ormea closer yet To counsel him;âmay even cast off her âThat bad Sebastian; but he also may . . . Or no, Polyxena, my only friend, He may not force you from me? Polyxena. Now, force me From you!âme, close by you as if there gloomed No Sebastians, no D'Ormeas on our pathâ At Rivoli or Turin, still at hand, Arch-counsellor, prime confidant . . . force me! Charles. Because I felt as sure, as I feel sure We clasp hands now, of being happy once. Young was I, quite neglected, nor concerned By the world's business that engrossed so much My father and my brother: if I peered From out my privacy,âamid the crash And blaze of nations, domineered those two. 'T was war, peaceâFrance our foe, nowâEngland, friendâ In love with Spainâat feud with Austria! Wellâ I wondered, laughed a moment's laugh for pride In the chivalrous couple, then let drop My curtainââI am out of it,â I saidâ When . . . Polyxena. You have told me, Charles. Charles. Polyxenaâ When suddenly,âa warm March day, just that! Just so much sunshine as the cottage child Basks in delighted, while the cottager Takes off his bonnet, as he ceases work, To catch the more of itâand it must fall Heavily on my brother! Had you seen Philipâthe lion-featured! not like me! Polyxena. I knowâ Charles. And Philip's mouth yet fast to mine, His dead cheek on my cheek, his arm still round My neck,âthey bade me rise, âfor I was heir To the Duke,â they said, âthe right hand of the Duke:â Till then he was my father, not the Duke. So . . . let me finish . . . the whole intricate World's-business their dead boy was born to, I Must conquer,âay, the brilliant thing he was, I, of a sudden must be: my faults, my follies, âAll bitter truths were told me, all at once, To end the sooner. What I simply styled Their overlooking me, had been contempt: How should the Duke employ himself, forsooth, With such an one, while lordly Philip rode By him their Turin through? But he was punished, And must put up withâme! 'T was sad enough To learn my future portion and submit. And then the wear and worry, blame on blame! For, spring-sounds in my ears, spring-smells about, How could I but grow dizzy in their pent Dim palace-rooms at first? My mother's look As they discussed my insignificance, She and my father, and I sitting by,â I bore; I knew how brave a son they missed: Philip had gaily run state-papers through, While Charles was spelling at them painfully! But Victor was my father spite of that. âDuke Victor's entire life has been,â I said, âInnumerable efforts to one end; âAnd on the point now of that end's success, âOur Ducal turning to a Kingly crown, âWhere's time to be reminded 't is his child âHe spurns?â And so I sufferedâscarcely suffered, Since I had you at length! Polyxena. âTo serve in place Of monarch, minister, and mistress, Charles. Charles. But, once that crown obtained, then was 't not like Our lot would alter? âWhen he rests, takes breath, âGlances around, sees who there's left to loveâ âNow that my mother's dead, sees I am leftâ Is it not like he'll love me at the last?â Well, Savoy turns Sardinia; the Duke's King: Could Iâprecisely thenâcould you expect His harshness to redouble? These few months Have been . . . have been . . . Polyxena, do you And God conduct me, or I lose myself! What would he have? What is 't they want with me? Him with this mistress and this minister, âYou see me and you hear him; judge us both! Pronounce what I should do, Polyxena! Polyxena. Endure, endure, beloved! Say you not He is your father? All's so incident To novel sway! Beside, our life must change: Or you'll acquire his kingcraft, or he'll find Harshness a sorry way of teaching it. I bear thisânot that there's so much to bear. Charles. You bear? Do not I know that you, tho' bound To silence for my sake, are perishing Piecemeal beside me? And how otherwise When every creephole from the hideous Court Is stopped: the Minister to dog me, hereâ The Mistress posted to entrap you, there! And thus shall we grow old in such a life; Not careless, never estranged,âbut old: to alter Our life, there is so much to alter! Polyxena. Comeâ Is it agreed that we forego complaint Even at Turin, yet complain we here At Rivoli? 'T were wiser you announced Our presence to the King. What's now afoot I wonder? Not that any more's to dread Than every day's embarrassment: but guess For me, why train so fast succeeded train On the high-road, each gayer still than each! I noticed your Archbishop's pursuivant, The sable cloak and silver cross; such pomp Bodes . . . what now, Charles? Can you conceive? Charles. Not I. Polyxena. A matter of some moment. Charles. There's our life! Which of the group of loiterers that stare From the lime-avenue, divines that Iâ About to figure presently, he thinks, In face of all assembledâam the one Who knows precisely least about it? Polyxena. Tush! D'Ormea's contrivance! Charles. Ay, how otherwise Should the young Prince serve for the old King's foil? âSo that the simplest courtier may remark 'T were idle raising parties for a Prince Content to linger the Court's laughing-stock. Something, 't is like, about that weary business [Pointing to papers he has laid down, and which Polyxena examines. âNot that I comprehend three words, of course, After all last night's study. Polyxena. The faint heart! Why, as we rode and you rehearsed just now Its substance . . . (that's the folded speech I mean, Concerning the Reduction of the Fiefs) âWhat would you have?âI fancied while you spoke, Some tones were just your father's. Charles. Flattery! Polyxena. I fancied so:âand here lurks, sure enough My note upon the Spanish Claims! You've mastered The fief-speech thoroughly: this other, mind, Is an opinion you deliver,âstay, Best read it slowly over once to me; Readâthere's bare time; you read it firmlyâloud âRather loud, looking in his face,âdon't sink Your eye onceâay, thus! âIf Spain claims . . .â begin âJust as you look at me! Charles. At you! Oh truly, You have I seen, say, marshalling your troops, Dismissing councils, or, through doors ajar, Head sunk on hand, devoured by slow chagrins âThen radiant, for a crown had all at once Seemed possible again! I can behold Him, whose least whisper ties my spirit fast, In this sweet brow, nought could divert me from Save objects like Sebastian's shameless lip, Or worse, the clipped grey hair and dead white face And dwindling eye as if it ached with guile, D'Ormea wears . . . [As he kisses her, enter from the King's apartment D'Ormea. I said he would divert My kisses from your brow! D'Ormea [aside]. Here! So, King Victor Spoke truth for once: and who's ordained, but I To make that memorable? Both in call, As he declared. Were 't better gnash the teeth, Or laugh outright now? Charles [to Polyxena]. What's his visit for? D'Ormea [aside]. I question if they even speak to me. Polyxena [to Charles]. Face the man! He'll suppose you fear him, else. [Aloud]. The Marquis bears the King's command, no doubt? D'Ormea [aside]. Precisely!âIf I threatened him, perhaps? Well, this at least is punishment enough! Men used to promise punishment would come. Charles. Deliver the King's message, Marquis! D'Ormea [aside]. Ahâ So anxious for his fate? [Aloud.] A word, my Prince, Before you see your fatherâjust one word Of counsel! Charles. Oh, your counsel certainly! Polyxena, the Marquis counsels us! Well, sir? Be brief, however! D'Ormea. What? You know As much as I?âpreceded me, most like, In knowledge! So! ('T is in his eye, besideâ His voice: he knows it, and his heart's on flame Already.) You surmise why you, myself, Del Borgo, Spava, fifty nobles more, Are summoned thus? Charles. Is the Prince used to know, At any time, the pleasure of the King, Before his minister?âPolyxena, Stay here till I conclude my task: I feel Your presence (smile not) through the walls, and take Fresh heart. The King's within that chamber? D'Ormea [passing the table whereon a paper lies, exclaims, as he glances at it]. âSpain!â Polyxena [aside to Charles]. Tarry awhile: what ails the minister? D'Ormea. Madam, I do not often trouble you. The Prince loathes, and you scorn meâlet that pass! But since it touches him and you, not me, Bid the Prince listen! Polyxena [to Charles]. Surely you will listen! -Deceit?âthose fingers crumpling up his vest? Charles. Deceitful to the very fingers' ends! D'Ormea [who has approached them, overlooks the other paper Charles continues to hold]. My project for the Fiefs! As I supposed! Sir, I must give you light upon those measures âFor this is mine, and that I spied of Spain, Mine too! Charles. Release me! Do you gloze on me Who bear in the world's face (that is, the world You make for me at Turin) your contempt? âYour measures?âWhen was not a hateful task D'Ormea's imposition? Leave my robe! What post can I bestow, what grant concede? Or do you take me for the King? D'Ormea. Not I! Not yet for King,ânot for, as yet, thank God, One who in . . . shall I say a year, a month? Ay!âshall be wretcheder than e'er was slave In his Sardinia.âEurope's spectacle And the world's bye-word! What? The Prince aggrieved That I excluded him our counsels? Here [Touching the paper in Charles's hand. Accept a method of extorting gold From Savoy's nobles, who must wring its worth In silver first from tillers of the soil, Whose hinds again have to contribute brass To make up the amount: there's counsel, sir, My counsel, one year old; and the fruit, thisâ Savoy's become a mass of misery And wrath, which one man has to meetâthe King: You're not the King! Another counsel, sir! Spain entertains a project (here it lies) Which, guessed, makes Austria offer that same King Thus much to baffle Spain; he promises; Then comes Spain, breathless lest she be forestalled, Her offer follows; and he promises . . . Charles. âPromises, sir, when he has just agreed To Austria's offer? D'Ormea. That's a counsel, Prince! But past our foresight, Spain and Austria (choosing To make their quarrel up between themselves Without the intervention of a friend) Produce both treaties, and both promises . . . Charles. How? D'Ormea. Prince, a counsel! And the fruit of that? Both parties covenant afresh, to fall Together on their friend, blot out his name, Abolish him from Europe. So, take note, Here's Austria and here's Spain to fight against: And what sustains the King but Savoy here, A miserable people mad with wrongs? You're not the King! Charles. Polyxena, you said All would clear up: all does clear up to me. D'Ormea. Clear up! 'T is no such thing to envy, then? You see the King's state in its length and breadth? You blame me now for keeping you aloof From counsels and the fruit of counsels? Wait Till I explain this morning's business! Charles [aside]. Noâ Stoop to my father, yes,âD'Ormea, no: âThe King's son, not to the King's counsellor! I will do something, but at least retain The credit of my deed. [Aloud]. Then it is this You now expressly come to tell me? D'Ormea. This To tell! You apprehend me? Charles. Perfectly. Further, D'Ormea, you have shown yourself, For the first time these many weeks and months, Disposed to do my bidding? D'Ormea. From the heart! Charles. Acquaint my father, first, I wait his pleasure Next . . . or, I'll tell you at a fitter time. Acquaint the King! D'Ormea [aside]. If I 'scape Victor yet! First, to prevent this stroke at me: if not,â Then, to avenge it! [To Charles.] Gracious sir, I go. [Goes. Charles. God, I forbore! Which more offends, that man Or that man's master? Is it come to this? Have they supposed (the sharpest insult yet) I needed e'en his intervention? No! Noâdull am I, conceded,âbut so dull, Scarcely! Their step decides me. Polyxena. How decides? Charles. You would be freed D'Ormea's eye and hers? âCould fly the court with me and live content? So, this it is for which the knights assemble! The whispers and the closeting of late, The savageness and insolence of old, âFor this! Polyxena. What mean you? Charles. How? You fail to catch Their clever plot? I missed it, but could you? These last two months of care to inculcate How dull I am,âD'Ormea's present visit To prove that, being dull, I might be worse Were I a Kingâas wretched as now dullâ You recognize in it no winding up Of a long plot? Polyxena. Why should there be a plot? Charles. The crown's secure now; I should shame the crownâ An old complaint; the point is, how to gain My place for one, more fit in Victor's eyes, His mistress the Sebastian's child. Polyxena. In truth? Charles. They dare not quite dethrone Sardinia's Prince: But they may descant on my dulness till They sting me into even praying them Grant leave to hide my head, resign my state, And end the coil. Not see now? In a word, They'd have me tender them myself my rights As one incapable;âsome cause for that, Since I delayed thus long to see their drift! I shall apprise the King he may resume My rights this moment. Polyxena. Pause! I dare not think So ill of Victor. Charles. Think no ill of him! Polyxena. âNor think him, then, so shallow as to suffer His purpose be divined thus easily. And yetâyou are the last of a great line; There's a great heritage at stake; new days Seemed to await this newest of the realms Of Europe:âCharles, you must withstand this! Charles. Ahâ You dare not then renounce the splendid Court For one whom all the world despises? Speak! Polyxena. My gentle husband, speak I will, and truth. Were this as you believe, and I once sure Your duty lay in so renouncing rule, I could . . . could? Oh what happiness it wereâ To live, my Charles, and die, alone with you! Charles. I grieve I asked you. To the presence, then! By this, D'Ormea acquaints the King, no doubt, He fears I am too simple for mere hints, And that no less will serve than Victor's mouth Demonstrating in council what I am. I have not breathed, I think, these many years! Polyxena. Why, it may be!âif he desire to wed That woman, call legitimate her child. Charles. You see as much? Oh, let his will have way! You'll not repent confiding in me, love? There's many a brighter spot in Piedmont, far, Than Rivoli. I'll seek him: or, suppose You hear first how I mean to speak my mind? âLoudly and firmly both, this time, be sure! I yet may see your Rhine-land, who can tell? Once away, ever then away! I breathe. Polyxena. And I too breathe. Charles. Come, my Polyxena! Part II. Enter King Victor, bearing the Regalia on a cushion, from his apartment. He calls loudly. Victor. D'Ormea!âfor patience fails me, treading thus Among the obscure trains I have laid,âmy knights Safe in the hall hereâin that anteroom, My son,âD'Ormea, where? Of this, one touchâ [Laying down the crown. This fireball to these mute black cold trainsâthen Outbreak enough! [Contemplating it.] To lose all, after all! This, glancing o'er my house for agesâshaped, Brave meteor, like the crown of Cyprus now, Jerusalem, Spain, England, every change The braver,âand when I have clutched a prize My ancestry died wan with watching for, To lose it!âby a slip, a fault, a trick Learnt to advantage once and not unlearned When past the use,ââjust this once moreâ (I thought) âUse it with Spain and Austria happily, âAnd then away with trick!â An oversight I'd have repaired thrice over, any time These fifty years, must happen now! There's peace At length; and I, to make the most of peace, Ventured my project on our people here, As needing not their help: which Europe knows, And means, cold-blooded, to dispose herself (Apart from plausibilities of war) To crush the new-made Kingâwho ne'er till now Feared her. As Duke, I lost each foot of earth And laughed at her: my name was left, my sword Left, all was left! But she can take, she knows, This crown, herself conceded . . . That's to try, Kind Europe! My career's not closed as yet! This boy was ever subject to my will, Timid and tameâthe fitter! D'Ormea, tooâ What if the sovereign also rid himself Of thee, his prime of parasites?âI delay! D'Ormea! [As D'Ormea enters, the King seats himself. My son, the Princeâattends he? D'Ormea. Sir, He does attend. The crown prepared!âit seems That you persist in your resolve. Victor. Who's come? The chancellor and the chamberlain? My knights? D'Ormea. The whole Annunziata. If, my liege, Your fortune had not tottered worse than now . . . Victor. Del Borgo has drawn up the schedules? mineâ My son's, too? Excellent! Only, beware Of the least blunder, or we look but fools. First, you read the Annulment of the Oaths; Del Borgo follows . . . no, the Prince shall sign; Then let Del Borgo read the Instrument: On which, I enter. D'Ormea. Sir, this may be truth; You, sir, may do as you affectâmay break Your engine, me, to pieces: try at least If not a spring remain worth saving! Take My counsel as I've counselled many times! What if the Spaniard and the Austrian threat? There's England, Holland, Veniceâwhich ally Select you? Victor. Aha! Come, D'Ormea,ââtruthâ Was on your lip a minute since. Allies? I've broken faith with Venice, Holland, England âAs who knows if not you? D'Ormea. But why with me Break faithâwith one ally, your best, break faith? Victor. When first I stumbled on you, Marquisâ't was At Mondoviâa little lawyer's clerk . . . D'Ormea. Therefore your soul's ally!âwho brought you through Your quarrel with the Pope, at pains enoughâ Who simply echoed you in these affairsâ On whom you cannot therefore visit these Affairs' ill-fortuneâwhom you trust to guide You safe (yes, on my soul) through these affairs! Victor. I was about to notice, had you not Prevented me, that since that great town kept With its chicane D'Ormea's satchel stuffed And D'Ormea's self sufficiently recluse, He missed a sight,âmy naval armament When I burned Toulon. How the skiff exults Upon the galliot's wave!ârises its height, O'ertops it even; but the great wave bursts, And hell-deep in the horrible profound Buries itself the galliot: shall the skiff Think to escape the sea's black trough in turn? Apply this: you have been my minister âNext me, above me possibly;âsad post, Huge care, abundant lack of peace of mind; Who would desiderate the eminence? You gave your soul to get it; you'd yet give Your soul to keep it, as I mean you shall, D'Ormea! What if the wave ebbed with me? Whereas it cants you to another crest; I toss you to my son; ride out your ride! D'Ormea. Ah, you so much despise me? Victor. You, D'Ormea? Nowise: and I'll inform you why. A king Must in his time have many ministers, And I've been rash enough to part with mine When I thought proper. Of the tribe, not one ( . . . Or wait, did Pianezze?âah, just the same!) Not one of them, ere his remonstrance reached The length of yours, but has assured me (commonly Standing much as you stand,âor nearer, say, The door to make his exit on his speech) âI should repent of what I did. D'Ormea, Be candid, you approached it when I bade you Prepare the schedules! But you stopped in time, You have not so assured me: how should I Despise you then? Enter Charles. Victor [changing his tone]. Are you instructed? Do My order, point by point! About it, sir! D'Ormea. You so despise me! [Aside.] One last stay remainsâ The boy's discretion there. [To Charles.] For your sake, Prince, I pleaded, wholly in your interest, To save you from this fate! Charles [aside]. Must I be told The Prince was supplicated forâby him? Victor [to D'Ormea]. Apprise Del Borgo, Spava, and the rest, Our son attends them; then return. D'Ormea. One word! Charles [aside]. A moment's pause and they would drive me hence, I do believe! D'Ormea [aside]. Let but the boy be firm! Victor. You disobey? Charles [to D'Ormea]. You do not disobey Me, at least? Did you promise that or no? D'Ormea. Sir, I am yours: what would you? Yours am I! Charles. When I have said what I shall say, 't is like Your face will ne'er again disgust me. Go! Through you, as through a breast of glass, I see. And for your conduct, from my youth till now, Take my contempt! You might have spared me much, Secured me somewhat, nor so harmed yourself: That's over now. Go, ne'er to come again! D'Ormea. As son, the fatherâfather as, the son! My wits! My wits! [Goes. Victor [seated]. And you, what meant you, pray, Speaking thus to D'Ormea? Charles. Let us not Waste words upon D'Ormea! Those I spent Have half unsettled what I came to say. His presence vexes to my very soul. Victor. One called to manage a kingdom, Charles, needs heart To bear up under worse annoyances Than seems D'Ormeaâto me, at least. Charles [aside]. Ah, good! He keeps me to the point. Then be it so. [Aloud.] Last night, sir, brought me certain papersâtheseâ To be reported on,âyour way of late. Is it last night's result that you demand? Victor. For God's sake, what has night brought forth? Pronounce The . . . what's your word?âresult! Charles. Sir, that had proved Quite worthy of your sneer, no doubt:âa few Lame thoughts, regard for you alone could wring, Lame as they are, from brains like mine, believe! As 't is, sir, I am spared both toil and sneer These are the papers. Victor. Well, sir? I suppose You hardly burned them. Now for your result! Charles. I never should have done great things of course, But . . . oh my father, had you loved me more! Victor. Loved? [Aside.] Has D'Ormea played me false, I wonder? [Aloud.] Why, Charles, a king's love is diffusedâyourself May overlook, perchance, your part in it. Our monarchy is absolutest now In Europe, or my trouble's thrown away. I love, my mode, that subjects each and all May have the power of loving, all and each, Their mode: I doubt not, many have their sons To trifle with, talk soft to, all day long: I have that crown, this chair, D'Ormea, Charles! Charles. 'Tis well I am a subject then, not you. Victor [aside]. D'Ormea has told him everything. [Aloud.] Aha! I apprehend you: when all's said, you take Your private station to be prized beyond My own, for instance? Charles. âDo and ever did So take it: 't is the method you pursue That grieves . . . Victor. These words! Let me express, my friend, Your thoughts. You penetrate what I supposed Secret. D'Ormea plies his trade betimes! I purpose to resign my crown to you. Charles. To me? Victor. Now,âin that chamber. Charles. You resign The crown to me? Victor. And time enough, Charles, sure? Confess with me, at four-and-sixty years A crown's a load. I covet quiet once Before I die, and summoned you for that. Charles. 'T is I will speak: you ever hated me. I bore it,âhave insulted me, borne tooâ Now you insult yourself; and I remember What I believed you, what you really are, And cannot bear it. What! My life has passed Under your eye, tormented as you know,â Your whole sagacities, one after one, At leisure brought to play on meâto prove me A fool, I thought and I submitted; now You'd prove . . . what would you prove me? Victor. This to me? I hardly know you! Charles. Know me? Oh indeed You do not! Wait till I complain next time Of my simplicity!âfor here's a sage Knows the world well, is not to be deceived, And his experience and his Macchiavels, D'Ormeas, teach himâwhat?âthat I this while Have envied him his crown! He has not smiled, I warrant,âhas not eaten, drunk, nor slept, For I was plotting with my Princess yonder! Who knows what we might do or might not do? Go now, be politic, astound the world! That sentry in the antechamberânay, The varlet who disposed this precious trap [Pointing to the crown. That was to take meâask them if they think Their own sons envy them their posts!âKnow me! Victor. But you know me, it seems: so, learn in brief. My pleasure. This assembly is convened . . . Charles. Tell me, that woman put it in your head! You were not sole contriver of the scheme, My father! Victor. Now observe me, sir! I jest Seldomâon these points, never. Here, I say, The knights assemble to see me concede, And you accept, Sardinia's crown. Charles. Farewell! 'T were vain to hope to change this: I can end it. Not that I cease from being yours, when sunk Into obscurity: I'll die for you, But not annoy you with my presence. Sir, Farewell! Farewell! Enter D'Ormea. D'Ormea [aside]. Ha, sure he's changed againâ Means not to fall into the cunning trap! Then Victor, I shall yet escape you, Victor! Victor [suddenly placing the crown upon the head of Charles]. D'Ormea, your King! [To Charles.] My son, obey me! Charles, Your father, clearer-sighted than yourself, Decides it must be so. 'Faith, this looks real! My reasons after; reason upon reason After: but now, obey me! Trust in me! By this, you save Sardinia, you save me! Why, the boy swoons! [To D'Ormea.] Come this side! D'Ormea [as Charles turns from him to Victor]. You persist? Victor. Yes, I conceive the gesture's meaning. 'Faith, He almost seems to hate you: how is that? Be re-assured, my Charles! Is 't over now? Then, Marquis, tell the new King what remains To do! A moment's work. Del Borgo reads The Act of Abdication out, you sign it, Then I sign; after that, come back to me. D'Ormea. Sir, for the last time, pause! Victor. Five minutes longer I am your sovereign, Marquis. Hesitateâ And I'll so turn those minutes to account That . . . Ay, you recollect me![Aside.] Could I bring My foolish mind to undergo the reading That Act of Abdication! [As Charles motions D'Ormea to precede him. Thanks, dear Charles! [Charles and D'Ormea retire. Victor. A novel feature in the boy,âindeed Just what I feared he wanted most. Quite right, This earnest tone: your truth, now, for effect! It answers every purpose: with that look, That voice,âI hear him: âI began no treaty,â (He speaks to Spain), ânor ever dreamed of this âYou show me; this I from my soul regret; âBut if my father signed it, bid not me âDishonour himâwho gave me all, beside:â And, âTrue,â says Spain, â 't were harsh to visit that âUpon the Prince.â Then come the nobles trooping: âI grieve at these exactionsâI had cut âThis hand off ere impose them; but shall I âUndo my father's deed?ââand they confer: âDoubtless he was no party, after all; âGive the Prince time!â Ay, give us time, but time! Only, he must not, when the dark day comes, Refer our friends to me and frustrate all. We'll have no child's play, no desponding fits, No Charles at each cross turn entreating Victor To take his crown again. Guard against that! Enter D'Ormea. Long live King Charles! NoâCharles's counsellor! Well, is it over, Marquis? Did I jest? D'Ormea. âKing Charles!â What then may you be? Victor. Anything! A country gentleman that, cured of bustle, Now beats a quick retreat toward Chambery, Would hunt and hawk and leave you noisy folk To drive your trade without him. I'm Count Remontâ Count Tendeâany little place's Count! D'Ormea. Then Victor, Captain against Catinat At Staffarde, where the French beat you; and Duke At Turin, where you beat the French; King late Of Savoy, Piedmont, Montferrat, Sardinia, âNow, âany little place's Countââ Victor. Proceed! D'Ormea. Breaker of vows to God, who crowned you first; Breaker of vows to man, who kept you since; Most profligate to me who outraged God And man to serve you, and am made pay crimes I was but privy to, by passing thus To your imbecile sonâwho, well you know, Mustâ(when the people here, and nations there, Clamour for you the main delinquent, slipped From King toââCount of any little placeâ) Must needs surrender me, all in his reach,â I, sir, forgive you: for I see the endâ See you on your returnâ(you will return)â To him you trust, a moment . . . Victor. Trust him? How? My poor man, merely a prime-minister, Make me know where my trust errs! D'Ormea. In his fear, His love, hisâbut discover for yourself What you are weakest, trusting in! Victor. Aha, D'Ormea, not a shrewder scheme than this In your repertory? You know old Victorâ Vain, choleric, inconstant, rashâ(I've heard Talkers who little thought the King so close) Felicitous now, were 't not, to provoke him To clean forget, one minute afterward, His solemn act, and call the nobles back And pray them give again the very power He has abjured?âfor the dear sake of what? Vengeance on you, D'Ormea! No: such am I, Count Tende or Count anything you please, âOnly, the same that did the things you say, And, among other things you say not, used Your finest fibre, meanest muscle,âyou I used, and now, since you will have it so, Leave to your fateâmere lumber in the midst, You and your works. Why, what on earth beside Are you made for, you sort of ministers? D'Ormea. Not left, though, to my fate! Your witless son Has more wit than to load himself with lumber: He foils you that way, and I follow you. Victor. Stay with my sonâprotect the weaker side! D'Ormea. Ay, to be tossed the people like a rag, And flung by them for Spain and Austria's sport, Abolishing the record of your part In all this perfidy! Victor. Prevent, beside, My own return! D'Ormea. That's half prevented now! 'T will go hard but you find a wondrous charm In exile, to discredit me. The Alps, Silk-mills to watch, vines asking vigilanceâ Hounds open for the stag, your hawk's a-wingâ Brave days that wait the Louis of the South, Italy's Janus! Victor. So, the lawyer's clerk Won't tell me that I shall repent! D'Ormea. You give me Full leave to ask if you repent? Victor. Whene'er Sufficient time's elapsed for that, you judge! [Shouts inside âKing Charles!â D'Ormea. Do you repent? Victor [after a slight pause]. . . . I've kept them waiting? Yes! Come in, complete the Abdication, sir! [They go out. Enter Polyxena. Polyxena. A shout! The sycophants are free of Charles! Oh is not this like Italy? No fruit Of his or my distempered fancy, this, But just an ordinary fact! Beside, Here they've set forms for such proceedings; Victor Imprisoned his own mother: he should know, If any, how a son's to be deprived Of a son's right. Our duty's palpable. Ne'er was my husband for the wily king And the unworthy subjects: be it so! Come you safe out of them, my Charles! Our life Grows not the broad and dazzling life, I dreamed Might prove your lot; for strength was shut in you None guessed but Iâstrength which, untramelled once, Had little shamed your vaunted ancestryâ Patience and self-devotion, fortitude, Simplicity and utter truthfulness âAll which, they shout to lose! So, now my work Beginsâto save him from regret. Save Charles Regret?âthe noble nature! He's not made Like these Italians: 't is a German soul. Charles enters crowned. Oh, where's the King's heir? Gone!âthe Crown Prince? Gone!â Where's Savoy? Gone!âSardinia? Gone! But Charles Is left! And when my Rhine-land bowers arrive, If he looked almost handsome yester-twilight As his grey eyes seemed widening into black Because I praised him, then how will he look? Farewell, you stripped and whited mulberry-trees Bound each to each by lazy ropes of vine! Now I'll teach you my language: I'm not forced To speak Italian now, Charles? [She sees the crown.] What is this? Answer meâwho has done this? Answer! Charles. He! I am King now. Polyxena. Oh worst, worst, worst of all! Tell me! What, Victor? He has made you King? What's he then? What's to follow this? You, King? Charles. Have I done wrong? Yes, for you were not by! Polyxena. Tell me from first to last. Charles. Hushâa new world Brightens before me; he is moved away âThe dark form that eclipsed it, he subsides Into a shape supporting me like you, And I, alone, tend upward, more and more Tend upward: I am grown Sardinia's King. Polyxena. Now stop: was not this Victor, Duke of Savoy At ten years old? Charles. He was. Polyxena. And the Duke spent Since then, just four-and-fifty years in toil To beâwhat? Charles. King. Polyxena. Then why unking himself? Charles. Those years are cause enough. Polyxena. The only cause? Charles. Some new perplexities. Polyxena. Which you can solve Although he cannot? Charles. He assures me so. Polyxena. And this he means shall lastâhow long? Charles. How long? Think you I fear the perils I confront? He's praising me before the people's faceâ My people! Polyxena. Then he's changedâgrown kind, the King? Where can the trap be? Charles. Heart and soul I pledge! My father, could I guard the crown you gained, Transmit as I received it,âall good else Would I surrender! Polyxena. Ah, it opens then Before you, all you dreaded formerly? You are rejoiced to be a king, my Charles? Charles. So much to dare? The better;âmuch to dread? The better. I'll adventure though alone. Triumph or die, there's Victor still to witness Who dies or triumphsâeither way, alone! Polyxena. Once I had found my share in triumph, Charles, Or death. Charles. But you are I! But you I call To take, Heaven's proxy, vows I tendered Heaven A moment since. I will deserve the crown! Polyxena. You will. [Aside.] No doubt it were a glorious thing For any people, if a heart like his Ruled over it. I would I saw the trap. Enter Victor. 'T is he must show me. Victor. So, the mask falls off An old man's foolish love at last. Spare thanks! I know you, and Polyxena I know. Here's CharlesâI am his guest nowâdoes he bid me Be seated? And my light-haired blue-eyed child Must not forget the old man far away At Chambery, who dozes while she reigns. Polyxena. Most grateful shall we now be, talking least Of gratitudeâindeed of anything That hinders what yourself must need to say To Charles. Charles. Pray speak, sir! Victor. 'Faith, not much to say: Only what shows itself, you once i' the point Of sight. You're now the King: you'll comprehend Much you may oft have wondered atâthe shifts, Dissimulation, wiliness I showed. For what's our post? Here's Savoy and here's Piedmont, Here's Montferratâa breadth here, a space thereâ To o'ersweep all these, what's one weapon worth? I often think of how they fought in Greece (Or Rome, which was it? You're the scholar, Charles!) You made a front-thrust? But if your shield too Were not adroitly planted, some shrewd knave Reached you behind; and him foiled, straight if thong And handle of that shield were not cast loose, And you enabled to outstrip the wind, Fresh foes assailed you, either side; 'scape these, And reach your place of refugeâe'en then, odds If the gate opened unless breath enough Were left in you to make its lord a speech. Oh, you will see! Charles. No: straight on shall I go, Truth helping; win with it or die with it. Victor. 'Faith, Charles, you're not made Europe's fighting-man! The barrier-guarder, if you please. You clutch Hold and consolidate, with envious France This side, with Austria that, the territory I heldâay, and will hold . . . which you shall hold Despite the couple! But I've surely earned Exemption from these weary politics, âThe privilege to prattle with my son And daughter here, though Europe wait the while. Polyxena. Nay, sir,âat Chambery, away for ever, As soon you will be, 't is farewell we bid you: Turn these few fleeting moments to account! 'T is just as though it were a death. Victor. Indeed! Polyxena [aside]. Is the trap there? Charles. Ay, call this partingâdeath! The sacreder your memory becomes. If I misrule Sardinia, how bring back My father? Victor. I mean . . . Polyxena [who watches Victor narrowly this while]. Your father does not mean You should be ruling for your father's sake: It is your people must concern you wholly Instead of him. You mean this, sir? (He drops My hand!) Charles. That people is now part of me. Victor. About the people! I took certain measures Some short time since . . . Oh, I know well, you know But little of my measures! These affect The nobles; we've resumed some grants, imposed A tax or two: prepare yourself, in short, For clamour on that score. Mark me: you yield No jot of aught entrusted you! Polyxena. No jot You yield! Charles. My father, when I took the oath, Although my eye might stray in search of yours, I heard it, understood it, promised God What you require. Till from this eminence He move me, here I keep, nor shall concede The meanest of my rights. Victor [aside]. The boy's a fool! âOr rather, I'm a fool: for, what's wrong here? To-day the sweets of reigning: let to-morrow Be ready with its bitters. Enter D'Ormea. There's beside Somewhat to press upon your notice first. Charles. Then why delay it for an instant, sir? That Spanish claim perchance? And, now you speak, âThis morning, my opinion was mature, Which, boy-like, I was bashful in producing To one I ne'er am like to fear in future! My thought is formed upon that Spanish claim. Victor. Betimes indeed. Not now, Charles! You require A host of papers on it. D'Ormea [coming forward]. Here they are. [To Charles.] I, sir, was minister and much beside Of the late monarch; to say little, him I served: on you I have, to say e'en less, No claim. This case contains those papers: with them I tender you my office. Victor [hastily.] Keep him, Charles! There's reason for itâmany reasons: you Distrust him, nor are so far wrong there,âbut He's mixed up in this matterâhe'll desire To quit you, for occasions known to me: Do not accept those reasons: have him stay! Polyxena [aside]. His minister thrust on us! Charles [to D'Ormea]. Sir, believe, In justice to myself, you do not need E'en this commending: howsoe'er might seem My feelings toward you, as a private man, They quit me in the vast and untried field Of action. Though I shall myself (as late In your own hearing I engaged to do) Preside o'er my Sardinia, yet your help Is necessary. Think the past forgotten And serve me now! D'Ormea. I did not offer you My serviceâwould that I could serve you, sir! As for the Spanish matter . . . Victor. But despatch At least the dead, in my good daughter's phrase, Before the living! Help to house me safe Ere with D'Ormea you set the world a-gape! Here is a paperâwill you overlook What I propose reserving for my needs? I get as far from you as possible: Here's what I reckon my expenditure. Charles [reading]. A miserable fifty thousand crowns Victor. Oh, quite enough for country gentlemen! Beside the exchequer happens . . . but find out All that, yourself! Charles [still reading]. âCount Tendeââwhat means this? Victor. Me: you were but an infant when I burst Through the defile of Tende upon France. Had only my allies kept true to me! No matter. Tende's, then, a name I take Just as . . . D'Ormea. âThe Marchioness Sebastian takes The name of Spigno. Charles. How, sir? Victor [to D'Ormea]. Fool! All that Was for my own detailing. [To Charles.] That anon! Charles [to D'Ormea]. Explain what you have said, sir! D'Ormea. I supposed The marriage of the King to her I named, Profoundly kept a secret these few weeks, Was not to be one, now he's Count. Polyxena [aside]. With us The ministerâwith him the mistress! Charles [to Victor]. Noâ Tell me you have not taken herâthat woman To live with, past recall! Victor. And where's the crime . . . Polyxena [to Charles]. True, sir, this is a matter past recall And past your cognizance. A day before, And you had been compelled to note this: now,â Why note it? The King saved his House from shame: What the Count did, is no concern of yours. Charles [after a pause]. The Spanish claim, D'Ormea! Victor. Why, my son, I took some ill-advised . . . one's age, in fact, Spoils everything: though I was overreached, A younger brain, we'll trust, may extricate Sardinia readily. To-morrow, D'Ormea, Inform the King! D'Ormea [without regarding Victor, and leisurely]. Thus stands the case with Spain: When first the Infant Carlos claimed his proper Succession to the throne of Tuscany . . . Victor. I tell you, that stands over! Let that rest! There is the policy! Charles [to D'Ormea]. Thus much I know, And moreâtoo much: the remedy? D'Ormea. Of course! No glimpse of one. Victor. No remedy at all! It makes the remedy itselfâtime makes it. D'Ormea [to Charles]. But if . . . Victor [still more hastily]. In fine, I shall take care of that: And, with another project that I have . . . D'Ormea [turning on him]. Oh, since Count Tende means to take again King Victor's crown!â Polyxena [throwing herself at Victor's feet]. E'en now retake it, sir! Oh speak! We are your subjects both, once more! Say itâa word effects it! You meant not, Nor do mean now, to take it: but you must! 'T is in youâin your natureâand the shame's Not half the shame 't would grow to afterwards! Charles. Polyxena! Polyxena. A word recalls the knightsâ Say it! What's promising and what's the past? Say you are still King Victor! D'Ormea. Better say The Count repents, in brief! [Victor rises. Charles. With such a crime I have not charged you, sir! Polyxena. (Charles turns from me!)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND YEAR, 1731.âKING CHARLES. Part I. Enter Queen Polyxena and D'Ormea.âA pause. Polyxena. And now, sir, what have you to say? D'Ormea. Count Tende . . . Polyxena. Affirm not I betrayed you; you resolve On uttering this strange intelligence âNay, post yourself to find me ere I reach The capital, because you know King Charles Tarries a day or two at Evian baths Behind me:âbut take warning,âhere and thus [Seating herself in the royal seat. I listen, if I listenânot your friend. Explicitly the statement, if you still Persist to urge it on me, must proceed: I am not made for aught else. D'Ormea. Good! Count Tende . . . Polyxena. I, who mistrust you, shall acquaint King Charles Who even more mistrusts you. D'Ormea. Does he so? Polyxena. Why should he not? D'Ormea. Ay, why not? Motives, seek You virtuous people, motives! Say, I serve God at the devil's biddingâwill that do? I'm proud: our people have been pacified, Really I know not howâ Polyxena. By truthfulness. D'Ormea. Exactly; that shows I had nought to do With pacifying them. Our foreign perils Also exceed my means to stay: but here 'T is otherwise, and my pride's piqued. Count Tende Completes a full year's absence: would you, madam, Have the old monarch back, his mistress back, His measures back? I pray you, act upon My counsel, or they will be. Polyxena. When? D'Ormea. Let's think. Home-matters settledâVictor's coming now; Let foreign matters settleâVictor's here Unless I stop him; as I will, this way. Polyxena [reading the papers he presents]. If this should prove a plot 'twixt you and Victor? You seek annoyances to give pretext For what you say you fear. D'Ormea. Oh, possibly! I go for nothing. Only show King Charles That thus Count Tende purposes return, And style me his inviter, if you please! Polyxena. Half of your tale is true; most like, the Count Seeks to return: but why stay you with us? To aid in such emergencies. D'Ormea. Keep safe Those papers: or, to serve me, leave no proof I thus have counselled! When the Count returns, And the King abdicates, 't will stead me little To have thus counselled. Polyxena. The King abdicate! D'Ormea. He's good, we knew long sinceâwise, we discoverâ Firm, let us hope:âbut I'd have gone to work With him away. Well! [Charles without.] In the Council Chamber? D'Ormea. All's lost! Polyxena. Oh, surely not King Charles! He's changedâ That's not this year's care-burthened voice and step: 'T is last year's step, the Prince's voice! D'Ormea. I know. [Enter Charles:âD'Ormea retiring a little. Charles. Now wish me joy, Polyxena! Wish it me The old way! [She embraces him. There was too much cause for that! But I have found myself again. What news At Turin? Oh, if you but felt the load I'm free ofâfree! I said this year would end Or it, or meâbut I am free, thank God! Polyxena. How, Charles? Charles. You do not guess? The day I found Sardinia's hideous coil, at home, abroad, And how my father was involved in it,â Of course, I vowed to rest and smile no more Until I cleared his name from obloquy. We did the people rightâ't was much to gain That point, redress our nobles' grievance, tooâ But that took place here, was no crying shame: All must be done abroad,âif I abroad Appeased the justly-angered Powers, destroyed The scandal, took down Victor's name at last From a bad eminence, I then might breathe And rest! No moment was to lose. Behold The proud resultâa Treaty, Austria, Spain Agree toâ D'Ormea [aside]. I shall merely stipulate For an experienced headsman. Charles. Not a soul Is compromised: the blotted past's a blank: Even D'Ormea escapes unquestioned. See! It reached me from Vienna; I remained At Evian to despatch the Count his news; 'T is gone to Chambery a week agoâ And here am I: do I deserve to feel Your warm white arms around me? D'Ormea [coming forward]. He knows that? Charles. What, in Heaven's name, means this? D'Ormea. He knows that matters Are settled at Vienna? Not too late! Plainly, unless you post this very hour Some man you trust (say, me) to Chambery And take precautions I acquaint you with, Your father will return here. Charles. Are you crazed, D'Ormea? Here? For what? As well return To take his crown! D'Ormea. He will return for that. Charles [to Polyxena]. You have not listened to this man? Polyxena. He spoke About your safetyâand I listened. [He disengages himself from her arms. Charles [to D'Ormea]. What Apprised you of the Count's intentions? D'Ormea. Me? His heart, sir; you may not be used to read Such evidence however; therefore read [Pointing to Polyxena's papers. My evidence. Charles [to Polyxena]. Oh, worthy this of you! And of your speech I never have forgotten, Though I professed forgetfulness; which haunts me As if I did not know how false it was; Which made me toil unconsciously thus long That there might be no least occasion left For aught of its prediction coming true! And now, when there is left no least occasion To instigate my father to such crimeâ When I might venture to forget (I hoped) That speech and recognize Polyxenaâ Oh worthy, to revive, and tenfold worse, That plague! D'Ormea at your ear, his slanders Still in your hand! Silent? Polyxena. As the wronged are. Charles. And you, D'Ormea, since when you have presumed To spy upon my father? I conceive What that wise paper shows, and easily. Since when? D'Ormea. The when and where and how belong To me. 'T is sad work, but I deal in such. You ofttimes serve yourself; I'd serve you here: Use makes me not so squeamish. In a word, Since the first hour he went to Chambery, Of his seven servants, five have I suborned. Charles. You hate my father? D'Ormea. Oh, just as you will! [Looking at Polyxena. A minute since, I loved himâhate him, now! What matter?âif you ponder just one thing: Has he that treaty?âhe is setting forward Already. Are your guards here? Charles. Well for you They are not! [To Polyxena]. Him I knew of old, but youâ To hear that pickthank, further his designs! [To D'Ormea. Guards?âwere they here, I'd bid them, for your trouble, Arrest you. D'Ormea. Guards you shall not want. I lived The servant of your choice, not of your need. You never greatly needed me till now That you discard me. This is my arrest. Again I tender you my chargeâits duty Would bid me press you read those documents. Here, sir! [Offering his badge of office. Charles [taking it]. The papers also! Do you think I dare not read them? Polyxena. Read them, sir! Charles. They prove, My father, still a month within the year Since he so solemnly consigned it me, Means to resume his crown? They shall prove that. Or my best dungeon . . . D'Ormea. Even say, Chambery! 'T is vacant, I surmise, by this. Charles. You prove Your words or pay their forfeit, sir. Go there! Polyxena, one chance to rend the veil Thickening and blackening 'twixt us two! Do say, You'll see the falsehood of the charges proved! Do say, at least, you wish to see them proved False chargesâmy heart's love of other times! Polyxena. Ah, Charles! Charles [to D'Ormea]. Precede me, sir! D'Ormea. And I'm at length A martyr for the truth! No end, they say, Of miracles. My conscious innocence! [As they go out, enterâby the middle door, at which he pausesâVictor. Victor. Sure I heard voices? No. Well, I do best To make at once for this, the heart o' the place. The old room! Nothing changed! So near my seat, D'Ormea? [Pushing away the stool which is by the King's chair. I want that meeting over first, I know not why. Tush, he, D'Ormea, slow To hearten me, the supple knave? That burst Of spite so eased him! He'll inform me . . . What? Why come I hither? All's in rough: let all Remain rough. There's full time to draw backânay, There's nought to draw back from, as yet; whereas, If reason should be, to arrest a course Of errorâreason good, to interpose And save, as I have saved so many times, Our House, admonish my son's giddy youth, Relieve him of a weight that proves too muchâ Now is the time,âor now, or never. 'Faith, This kind of step is pitiful, not due To Charles, this stealing backâhither, because He's from his capital! Oh Victor! Victor! But thus it is. The age of crafty men Is loathsome; youth contrives to carry off Dissimulation; we may intersperse Extenuating passages of strength, Ardour, vivacity, and witâmay turn E'en guile into a voluntary grace: But one's old age, when graces drop away And leave guile the pure staple of our livesâ Ah, loathsome! Not soâor why pause I? Turin Is mine to have, were I so minded, for The asking; all the army's mineâI've witnessed Each private fight beneath me; all the Court's Mine too; and, best of all, D'Ormea's still D'Ormea and mine. There's some grace clinging yet. Had I decided on this step, ere midnight I'd take the crown. No. Just this step to rise Exhausts me. Here am I arrived: the rest Must be done for me. Would I could sit here And let things right themselves, the masque unmasque Of the old King, crownless, grey hair and hot blood,â The young King, crowned, but calm before his time, They say,âthe eager mistress with her taunts,â And the sad earnest wife who motions me Awayâay, there she knelt to me! E'en yet I can return and sleep at Chambery A dream out. Rather shake it off at Turin, King Victor! Say: to Turinâyes, or no? 'T is this relentless noonday-lighted chamber, Lighted like life but silent as the grave, That disconcerts me. That's the change must strike. No silence last year! Some one flung doors wide (Those two great doors which scrutinize me now) And out I went 'mid crowds of menâmen talking, Men watching if my lip fell or brow knit, Men saw me safe forth, put me on my road: That makes the misery of this return. Oh had a battle done it! Had I dropped, Haling some battle, three entire days old, Hither and thither by the foreheadâdropped In Spain, in Austria, best of all, in Franceâ Spurned on its horns or underneath its hooves, When the spent monster went upon its knees To pad and pash the prostrate wretchâI, Victor, Sole to have stood up against France, beat down By inches, brayed to pieces finally In some vast unimaginable charge, A flying hell of horse and foot and guns Over me, and all 's lost, for ever lost, There's no more Victor when the world wakes up! Then silence, as of a raw battle-field, Throughout the world. Then after (as whole days After, you catch at intervals faint noise Through the stiff crust of frozen blood)âthere creeps A rumour forth, so faint, no noise at all, That a strange old man, with face outworn for wounds Is stumbling on from frontier town to town, Begging a pittance that may help him find His Turin out; what scorn and laughter follow The coin you fling into his cap! And last, Some bright morn, how men crowd about the midst O' the market-place, where takes the old king breath Ere with his crutch he strike the palace-gate Wide ope! To Turin, yes or noâor no? Re-enter Charles with papers. Charles. Just as I thought! A miserable falsehood Of hirelings discontented with their pay And longing for enfranchisement! A few Testy expressions of old age that thinks To keep alive its dignity o'er slaves By means that suit their natures! [Tearing them.] Thus they shake My faith in Victor! [Turning, he discovers Victor. Victor [after a pause]. Not at Evian, Charles? What's this? Why do you run to close the doors? No welcome for your father? Charles [aside]. Not his voice! What would I give for one imperious tone Of the old sort! That's gone for ever. Victor. Must I ask once more . . . Charles. NoâI concede it, sir! You are returned for . . . true, your health declines; True, Chambery's a bleak unkindly spot; You'd choose one fitter for your final lodgeâ Veneria, or Moncaglierâay, that's closed And I concede it. Victor. I received advices Of the conclusion of the Spanish matter, Dated from Evian Baths . . . Charles. And you forbore To visit me at Evian, satisfied The work I had to do would fully task The little wit I have, and that your presence Would only disconcert meâ Victor. Charles? Charles. âMe, set For ever in a foreign course to yours, And . . . Sir, this way of wile were good to catch, But I have not the sleight of it. The truth! Though I sink under it! What brings you here? Victor. Not hope of this reception, certainly, From one who'd scarce assume a stranger mode Of speech, did I return to bring about Some awfulest calamity! Charles. âYou mean, Did you require your crown again! Oh yes, I should speak otherwise! But turn not that To jesting! Sir, the truth! Your health declines? Is aught deficient in your equipage? Wisely you seek myself to make complaint, And foil the malice of the world which laughs At petty discontents; but I shall care That not a soul knows of this visit. Speak! Victor [aside]. Here is the grateful much-professing son Prepared to worship me, for whose sole sake I think to waive my plans of public good! [Aloud.] Nay, Charles, if I did seek to take once more My crown, were so disposed to plague myself, What would be warrant for this bitterness? I gave itâgrant I would resume itâwell? Charles. I should say simplyâleaving out the why And howâyou made me swear to keep that crown: And as you then intended . . . Victor. Fool! What way Could I intend or not intend? As man, With a man's will, when I say âI intend,â I can intend up to a certain point, No farther. I intended to preserve The crown of Savoy and Sardinia whole: And if events arise demonstrating The way, I hoped should guard it, rather like To lose it . . . Charles. Keep within your sphere and mine! It is God's province we usurp on, else. Here, blindfold through the maze of things we walk By a slight clue of false, true, right and wrong; All else is rambling and presumption. I Have sworn to keep this kingdom: there's my truth. Victor. Truth, boy, is here, within my breast; and in Your recognition of it, truth is, too; And in the effect of all this tortuous dealing With falsehood, used to carry out the truth, âIn its success, this falsehood turns, again, Truth for the world. But you are right: these themes Are over-subtle. I should rather say In such a case, frankly,âit fails, my scheme: I hoped to see you bring about, yourself, What I must bring about. I interpose On your behalfâwith my son's good in sightâ To hold what he is nearly letting go, Confirm his title, add a grace perhaps. There's Sicily, for instance,âgranted me And taken back, some years since: till I give That island with the rest, my work's half done. For his sake, therefore, as of those he rules . . . Charles. Our sakes are one; and that, you could not say, Because my answer would present itself Forthwith:âa year has wrought an age's change. This people's not the people now, you once Could benefit; nor is my policy Your policy. Victor [with an outburst]. I know it! You undo All I have doneâmy life of toil and care! I left you this the absolutest rule In Europe: do you think I sit and smile, Bid you throw power to the populaceâ See my Sardinia, that has kept apart, Join in the mad and democratic whirl Whereto I see all Europe haste full tide? England casts off her kings; France mimics England: This realm I hoped was safe. Yet here I talk, When I can save it, not by force alone, But bidding plagues, which follow sons like you, Fasten upon my disobedient . . . [Recollecting himself.] Surely I could say thisâif minded soâmy son? Charles. You could not. Bitterer curses than your curse Have I long since denounced upon myself If I misused my power. In fear of these I entered on those measuresâwill abide By them: so, I should say, Count Tende . . . Victor. No! But no! But if, my Charles, yourâmore than oldâ Half-foolish father urged these arguments, And then confessed them futile, but said plainly That he forgot his promise, found his strength Fail him, had thought at savage Chambery Too much of brilliant Turin, Rivoli here, And Susa, and Veneria, and Supergaâ Pined for the pleasant places he had built When he was fortunate and youngâ Charles. My father! Victor. Stay yet!âand if he said he could not die Deprived of baubles he had put aside, He deemed, for everâof the Crown that binds Your brain up, whole, sound and impregnable, Creating kinglinessâthe Sceptre too, Whose mere wind, should you wave it, back would beat Invadersâand the golden Ball which throbs As if you grasped the palpitating heart Indeed o' the realm, to mould as choose you may! âIf I must totter up and down the streets My sires built, where myself have introduced And fostered laws and letters, sciences, The civil and the military arts! Stay, Charles! I see you letting me pretend To live my former self once moreâKing Victor, The venturous yet politic: they style me Again, the Father of the Prince: friends wink Good-humouredly at the delusion you So sedulously guard from all rough truths That else would break upon my dotage!âYouâ Whom now I see preventing my old shameâ I tell not, point by cruel point, my taleâ For is 't not in your breast my brow is hid? Is not your hand extended? Say you not . . . Enter D'Ormea, leading in Polyxena. Polyxena [advancing and withdrawing Charlesâto Victor]. In this conjuncture even, he would say (Though with a moistened eye and quivering lip) The suppliant is my father. I must save A great man from himself, nor see him fling His well-earned fame away: there must not follow Ruin so utter, a break-down of worth So absolute: no enemy shall learn, He thrust his child 'twixt danger and himself, And, when that child somehow stood danger out, Stole back with serpent wiles to ruin Charles âBody, that's much,âand soul, that's moreâand realm, That's most of all! No enemy shall say . . . D'Ormea. Do you repent, sir? Victor [resuming himself]. D'Ormea? This is well! Worthily done, King Charles, craftily done! Judiciously you post these, to o'erhear The little your importunate father thrusts Himself on you to say!âAh, they'll correct The amiable blind facility You show in answering his peevish suit. What can he need to sue for? Thanks, D'Ormea! You have fulfilled your office: but for you, The old Count might have drawn some few more livres To swell his income! Had you, lady, missed The moment, a permission might be granted To buttress up my ruinous old pile! But you remember properly the list Of wise precautions I took when I gave Nearly as much awayâto reap the fruits I should have looked for! Charles. Thanks, sir: degrade me, So you remain yourself! Adieu! Victor. I'll not Forget it for the future, nor presume Next time to slight such mediators! Nayâ Had I first moved them both to intercede, I might secure a chamber in Moncaglier âWho knows? Charles. Adieu! Victor. You bid me this adieu With the old spirit? Charles. Adieu! Victor. CharlesâCharles! Charles. Adieu! [Victor goes. Charles. You were mistaken, Marquis, as you hear. 'T was for another purpose the Count came. The Count desires Moncaglier. Give the order! D'Ormea [leisurely]. Your minister has lost your confidence, Asserting late, for his own purposes, Count Tende would . . . Charles [flinging his badge back]. Be still the minister! And give a loose to your insulting joy; It irks me more thus stifled than expressed: Loose it! D'Ormea. There's none to loose, alas! I see I never am to die a martyr. Polyxena. Charles! Charles. No praise, at least, Polyxenaâno praise! Part II. D'Ormea, seated, folding papers he has been examining. This at the last effects it: now, King Charles Or else King Victorâthat's a balance: but now, D'Ormea the arch-culprit, either turn O' the scale,âthat's sure enough. A point to solve, My masters, moralists, whate'er your style! When you discover why I push myself Into a pitfall you'd pass safely by, Impart to me among the rest! No matter. Prompt are the righteous ever with their rede To us the wrongful; lesson them this once! For safe among the wicked are you set, D'Ormea! We lament life's brevity, Yet quarter e'en the threescore years and ten, Nor stick to call the quarter roundly âlife.â D'Ormea was wicked, say, some twenty years; A tree so long was stunted; afterward, What if it grew, continued growing, till No fellow of the forest equalled it? 'T was a stump then; a stump it still must be: While forward saplings, at the outset checked, In virtue of that first sprout keep their style Amid the forest's green fraternity. Thus I shoot up to surely get lopped down And bound up for the burning. Now for it! Enter Charles and Polyxena with Attendants. D'Ormea [rises]. Sir, in the due discharge of this my officeâ This enforced summons of yourself from Turin, And the disclosure I am bound to make To-night,âthere must already be, I feel, So much that wounds . . . Charles. Well, sir? D'Ormea. âThat I, perchance, May utter also what, another time, Would irk much,âit may prove less irksome now. Charles. What would you utter? D'Ormea. That I from my soul Grieve at to-night's event: for you I grieve, E'en grieve for . . . Charles. Tush, another time for talk! My kingdom is in imminent danger? D'Ormea. Let The Count communicate with Franceâits King, His grandson, will have Fleury's aid for this, Though for no other war. Charles. First for the levies: What forces can I muster presently? [D'Ormea delivers papers which Charles inspects. Charles. Goodâvery good. Montorio . . . how is this? âEquips me double the old complement Of soldiers? D'Ormea. Since his land has been relieved From double imposts, this he manages: But under the late monarch . . . Charles. Peace! I know. Count Spava has omitted mentioning What proxy is to head these troops of his. D'Ormea. Count Spava means to head his troops himself. Something to fight for now; âWhereas,â says he, âUnder the sovereign's fatherâ . . . Charles. It would seem That all my people love me. D'Ormea. Yes. [To Polyxena while Charles continues to inspect the papers. A temper Like Victor's may avail to keep a state; He terrifies men and they fall not off; Good to restrain: best, if restraint were all. But, with the silent circle round him, ends Such sway: our King's begins precisely there. For to suggest, impel and set at work, Is quite another function. Men may slight, In time of peace, the King who brought them peace: In war,âhis voice, his eyes, help more than fear. They love you, sir! Charles [to Attendants]. Bring the regalia forth! Quit the room! And now, Marquis, answer me! Why should the King of France invade my realm? D'Ormea. Why? Did I not acquaint your Majesty An hour ago? Charles. I choose to hear again What then I heard. D'Ormea. Because, sir, as I said, Your father is resolved to have his crown At any risk; and, as I judge, calls in The foreigner to aid him. Charles. And your reason For saying this? D'Ormea [aside]. Ay, just his father's way! [To Charles.] The Count wrote yesterday to your forces' Chief, Rhebinderâmade demand of helpâ Charles. To try Rhebinderâhe's of alien blood: aught else? D'Ormea. Receiving a refusal,âsome hours after, The Count called on Del Borgo to deliver The Act of Abdication: he refusing, Or hesitating, ratherâ Charles. What ensued? D'Ormea. At midnight, only two hours since, at Turin, He rode in person to the citadel With one attendant, to Soccorso gate, And bade the governor, San Remi, openâ Admit him. Charles. For a purpose I divine. These three were faithful, then? D'Ormea. They told it me. And Iâ Charles. Most faithfulâ D'Ormea. Tell it youâwith this Moreover of my own: if, an hour hence, You have not interposed, the Count will be O' the road to France for succour. Charles. Very good! You do your duty now to me your monarch Fully, I warrant?âhave, that is, your project For saving both of us disgrace, no doubt? D'Ormea. I give my counsel,âand the only one. A month since, I besought you to employ Restraints which had prevented many a pang: But now the harsher course must be pursued. These papers, made for the emergency, Will pain you to subscribe: this is a list Of those suspected merelyâmen to watch; Thisâof the few of the Count's very household You must, however reluctantly, arrest; While here's a method of remonstranceâsure Not stronger than the case demandsâto take With the Count's self. Charles. Deliver those three papers. Polyxena [while Charles inspects themâto D'Ormea]. Your measures are not over-harsh, sir: France Will hardly be deterred from her intents By these. D'Ormea. If who proposes might dispose, I could soon satisfy you. Even these, Hear what he'll say at my presenting! Charles [who has signed them]. There! About the warrants! You've my signature. What turns you pale? I do my duty by you In acting boldly thus on your advice. D'Ormea [reading them separately]. Arrest the people I suspected merely? Charles. Did you suspect them? D'Ormea. Doubtless: butâbutâsir, This Forquieri's governor of Turin, And Rivarol and he have influence over Half of the capital! Rabella, too? Why, sirâ Charles. Oh, leave the fear to me! D'Ormea [still reading]. You bid me Incarcerate the people on this list? Sirâ Charles. But you never bade arrest those men, So close related to my father too, On trifling grounds? D'Ormea. Oh, as for that, St. George, President of Chambery's senators, Is hatching treason! stillâ [More troubled.] Sir, Count Cumiane Is brother to your father's wife! What's here? Arrest the wife herself? Charles. You seem to think A venial crime this plot against me. Well? D'Ormea [who has read the last paper]. Wherefore am I thus ruined? Why not take My life at once? This poor formality Is, let me say, unworthy you! Prevent it You, madam! I have served you, am prepared For all disgraces: only, let disgrace Be plain, be properâproper for the world To pass its judgment on 'twixt you and me! Take back your warrant, I will none of it! Charles. Here is a man to talk of fickleness! He stakes his life upon my father's falsehood; I bid him . . . D'Ormea. Not you! Were he trebly false, You do not bid me . . . Charles. Is 't not written there? I thought so: giveâI'll set it right. D'Ormea. Is it there? Oh yes, and plainâarrest him nowâdrag here Your father! And were all six times as plain, Do you suppose I trust it? Charles. Just one word! You bring him, taken in the act of flight, Or else your life is forfeit. D'Ormea. Ay, to Turin I bring him, and to-morrow? Charles. Here and now! The whole thing is a lie, a hateful lie, As I believed and as my father said. I knew it from the first, but was compelled To circumvent you; and the great D'Ormea, That baffled Alberoni and tricked Coscia, The miserable sower of such discord 'Twixt sire and son, is in the toils at last. Oh I see! you arriveâthis plan of yours, Weak as it is, torments sufficiently A sick old peevish manâwrings hasty speech, An ill-considered threat from him; that's noted; Then out you ferret papers, his amusement In lonely hours of lassitudeâexamine The day-by-day report of your paid spiesâ And back you come: all was not ripe, you find, And, as you hope, may keep from ripening yet, But you were in bare time! Only, 't were best I never saw my fatherâthese old men Are potent in excuses: and meanwhile, D'Ormea's the man I cannot do without! Polyxena. Charlesâ Charles. Ah, no question! You against me too! You'd have me eat and drink and sleep, live, die With this lie coiled about me, choking me! No, no, D'Ormea! You venture life, you say, Upon my father's perfidy: and I Have, on the whole, no right to disregard The chains of testimony you thus wind About me; though I doâdo from my soul Discredit them: still I must authorize These measures, and I will. Perugia! [Many Officers enter.] Countâ You and Solar, with all the force you have, Stand at the Marquis' orders: what he bids, Implicitly perform! You are to bring A traitor here; the man that's likest one At present, fronts me; you are at his beck For a full hour! he undertakes to show A fouler than himself,âbut, failing that, Return with him, and, as my father lives, He dies this night! The clemency you blame So oft, shall be revokedârights exercised, Too long abjured. [To D'Ormea.] Now sir, about the work! To save your king and country! Take the warrant! D'Ormea. You hear the sovereign's mandate, Count Perugia? Obey me! As your diligence, expect Reward! All follow to Moncaglier! Charles [in great anguish]. D'Ormea! [D'Ormea goes. He goes, lit up with that appalling smile! [To Polyxena, after a pause. At least you understand all this? Polyxena. These means Of our defenceâthese measures of precaution? Charles. It must be the best way; I should have else Withered beneath his scorn. Polyxena. What would you say? Charles. Why, do you think I mean to keep the crown, Polyxena? Polyxena. You then believe the story In spite of allâthat Victor comes? Charles. Believe it? I know that he is comingâfeel the strength That has upheld me leave me at his coming! 'T was mine, and now he takes his own again. Some kinds of strength are well enough to have; But who's to have that strength? Let my crown go! I meant to keep it; but I cannotâcannot! Only, he shall not taunt meâhe, the first . . See if he would not be the first to taunt me With having left his kingdom at a word. With letting it be conquered without stroke, With . . . noânoâ't is no worse than when he left! I've just to bid him take it, and, that over, We'll fly awayâfly, for I loathe this Turin, This Rivoli, all titles loathe, all state. We'd best go to your countryâunless God Send I die now! Polyxena. Charles, hear me! Charles. And again Shall you be my Polyxenaâyou'll take me Out of this woe! Yes, do speak, and keep speaking! I would not let you speak just now, for fear You'd counsel me against him: but talk, now, As we two used to talk in blessed times: Bid me endure all his caprices; take me From this mad post above him! Polyxena. I believe We are undone, but from a different cause. All your resources, down to the least guard, Are at D'Ormea's beck. What if, the while, He act in concert with your father? We Indeed were lost. This lonely Rivoliâ Where find a better place for them? Charles [pacing the room]. And why Does Victor come? To undo all that's done, Restore the past, prevent the future! Seat His mistress in your seat, and place in mine . . . Oh, my own people, whom will you find there, To ask of, to consult with, to care for, To hold up with your hands? Whom? One that's falseâ Falseâfrom the head's crown to the foot's sole, false! The best is, that I knew it in my heart From the beginning, and expected this, And hated you, Polyxena, because You saw thro' him, though I too saw thro' him, Saw that he meant this while he crowned me, while He prayed for me,ânay, while he kissed my brow, I sawâ Polyxena. But if your measures take effect, D'Ormea true to you? Charles. Then worst of all! I shall have loosed that callous wretch on him! Well may the woman taunt him with his childâ I, eating here his bread, clothed in his clothes, Seated upon his seat, let slip D'Ormea To outrage him! We talkâperchance he tears My father from his bed; the old hands feel For one who is not, but who should be there, He finds D'Ormea! D'Ormea too finds him! The crowded chamber when the lights go outâ Closed doorsâthe horrid scuffle in the darkâ The accursed prompting of the minute! My guards! To horseâand after, with meâand prevent! Polyxena [seizing his hand]. King Charles! Pause here upon this strip of time Allotted you out of eternity! Crowns are from God: you in his name hold yours. Your life's no least thing, were it fit your life Should be abjured along with rule; but now, Keep both! Your duty is to live and ruleâ You, who would vulgarly look fine enough In the world's eye, deserting your soul's charge,â Ay, you would have men's praise, this Rivoli Would be illumined! While, as 't is, no doubt, Something of stain will ever rest on you; No one will rightly know why you refused To abdicate; they'll talk of deeds you could Have done, no doubt,ânor do I much expect Future achievement will blot out the past, Envelope it in hazeânor shall we two Live happy any more. 'T will be, I feel, Only in moments that the duty's seen As palpably as now: the months, the years Of painful indistinctness are to come, While daily must we tread these palace-rooms Pregnant with memories of the past: your eye May turn to mine and find no comfort there, Through fancies that beset me, as yourself, Of other courses, with far other issues, We might have taken this great night: such bear, As I will bear! What matters happiness? Duty! There's man's one moment: this is yours! [Putting the crown on his head, and the sceptre in his hand, she places him on his seat: a long pause and silence. Enter D'Ormea and Victor, with Guards. Victor. At last I speak; but onceâthat once, to you! 'T is you I ask, not these your varletry, Who's King of us? Charles [from his seat.] Count Tende . . . Victor. What your spies Assert I ponder in my soul, I sayâ Here to your face, amid your guards! I choose To take again the crown whose shadow I gaveâ For still its potency surrounds the weak White locks their felon hands have discomposed. Or I'll not ask who's King, but simply, who Withholds the crown I claim? Deliver it! I have no friend in the wide world: nor France Nor England cares for me: you see the sum Of what I can avail. Deliver it! Charles. Take it, my father! And now say in turn, Was it done well, my fatherâsure not well, To try me thus! I might have seen much cause For keeping itâtoo easily seen cause! But, from that moment, e'en more woefully My life had pined away, than pine it will. Already you have much to answer for. My life to pine is nothing,âher sunk eyes Were happy once! No doubt, my people think I am their King still . . . but I cannot strive! Take it! Victor [one hand on the crown Charles offers, the other on his neck]. So few years give it quietly, My son! It will drop from me. See you not? A crown's unlike a sword to give awayâ That, let a strong hand to a weak hand give! But crowns should slip from palsied brows to heads Young as this head: yet mine is weak enough, E'en weaker than I knew. I seek for phrases To vindicate my right. 'T is of a piece! All is alike gone by with meâwho beat Once D'Orleans in his linesâhis very lines! To have been Eugene's comrade, Louis's rival, And now . . . Charles [putting the crown on him, to the rest]. The King speaks, yet none kneels, I think! Victor. I am then King! As I became a King Despite the nations, kept myself a King, So I die King, with Kingship dying too Around me. I have lasted Europe's time. What wants my story of completion? Where Must needs the damning break show? Who mistrusts My children hereâtell they of any break 'Twixt my day's sunrise and its fiery fall? And who were by me when I died but they? D'Ormea there! Charles. What means he? Victor. Ever there! Charlesâhow to save your story! Mine must go Sayâsay that you refused the crown to me! Charles, yours shall be my story! You immured Me, say, at Rivoli. A single year I spend without a sight of you, then die. That will serve every purposeâtell that tale The world! Charles. Mistrust me? Help! Victor. Past help, past reach! 'T is in the heartâyou cannot reach the heart: This broke mine, that I did believe, you, Charles, Would have denied me and disgraced me. Polyxena. Charles Has never ceased to be your subject, sir! He reigned at first through setting up yourself As pattern: if he e'er seemed harsh to you, 'T was from a too intense appreciation Of your own character: he acted youâ Ne'er for an instant did I think it real, Nor look for any other than this end. I hold him worlds the worse on that account; But so it was. Charles [to Polyxena]. I love you now indeed. [To Victor.] You never knew me. Victor. Hardly till this moment, When I seem learning many other things Because the time for using them is past. If 't were to do again! That's idly wished. Truthfulness might prove policy as good As guile. Is this my daughter's forehead? Yes: I've made it fitter now to be a queen's Than formerly: I've ploughed the deep lines there Which keep too well a crown from slipping off. No matter. Guile has made me King again. Louisâ't was in King Victor's time:âlong since, When Louis reigned and, also, Victor reigned. How the world talks already of us two! God of eclipse and each discoloured star, Why do I linger then? Ha! Where lurks he? D'Ormea! Nearer to your King! Now stand! [Collecting his strength as D'Ormea approaches. You lied, D'Ormea! I do not repent. [Dies.</field>
