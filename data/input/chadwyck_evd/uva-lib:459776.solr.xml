      <field name="fulltext">Principibus placuisse Viris non Ultima Laus est. Hor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO His Royal Highness, THE DUKE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. When first our Authour took this Play in hand, He doubted much and long was at a stand. He knew the Fame and Memory of Kings Were to be treated of as Sacred things. Not as th' are represented in this Age, Where they appear the Lumber of the Stage; Us'd only just for reconciling Tools, Or what is worse, made Villains all, or Fools. Besides, the Characters he shows to Night, He found were very difficult to Write: He found the Fame of France and Spain at stake, Therefore long paus'd and fear'd which part to take; Till this his judgment safest understood, To make 'em both Heroick as he cou'd. But now the greatest stop was yet unpass't, He found himself, Alas! confin'd too fast. He is a man of Pleasures, Sirs, like you, And therefore hardly could to bus'ness bow, Till at the last he did this Conquest get, To make his pleasure whetstone to his wit, So sometimes for variety he writ. But as those Block-heads who discourse by Rote, Sometimes speak sence although they rarely know't. So he scarce knew to what his work would grow; But 'twas a Play because it would be so: Yet well he knows this is a weak pretence, For Idleness is the worst want of sence. Let him not now of carelessness be Taxt, He'l write in earnest when he writes the next; Mean while— Prune his superfluous Branches, never spare; Yet do it kindly, be not too severe, He may bear better fruit another year.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the First. SCENE the First. A Palace Royal. The Curtain drawn discovers the King and Queen Attended, Don Carlos, the Marquess of Posa; Rui-Gomez, &amp;c. Eboli, Henrietta, Garcia, Attendants, Guards. King. Happy the Monarch on whose Brow no Cares Add weight to the bright Diadem he weares. Like me in all that he can wish for, blest: Renown, and Love, The Gentlest calms of rest And peace, adorn my Brow, enrich my Breast. To me great Nations Tributary are, Though whilest my Vast Dominions spreads so far, Where most I Reign, I must pay homage, here. [To the Queen. Approach bright Mistress of my purest vows, Now show me him that more Religion owes To Heav'n, or to its Altars more Devoutly bows. Don Carlos. So Merchants cast upon some Savage Coast, Are forc't to see their dearest Treasures lost. Curse! What's obedience? a false Notion made [aside. By Priests, who when they found old Cheats decay'd, By such new Arts kept up declining Trade. A Father oh!— King. —Why does my Carlos shrowd His Joy, and when all's Sunshine wear a Cloud? My Son, thus for thy Glory I provide; From this Fair Charmer, and our Royal Bride Shall such a Noble Race of Heroe's spring, As may adorn the Court when thou art King. D. Car. A greater Glory I can never know Then what already I enjoy in you; The Brightest Ornaments of Crowns and Powers, I only can admire, as they are yours. K. Heaven! How he stands unmov'd! not the least show Of Transport. D. Car. —Not admire your happiness! I do As much admire it as I rev'rence you. Let me express the mighty Joy I feel. Thus Sir I pay my duty when I kneel. Kneels to the Queen. Queen. How hard it is his Passion to Confine: I'm sure 'tis so, if I may judge by mine: [aside. Alas, my Lord, y'are too obsequious now. [To Carlos. D. Carlos. Oh might I but Enjoy this pleasure still! Here would I worship, and for ever kneel. Queen. For Heav'n my Lord, you know not what you do. King. Still there appears disturbance on his brow: And in his looks an Earnestness I read, Which from no Common Causes can proceed: [aside. I'le probe him deep— —When when my dearest Joy [To the Queen. Shall I the mighty debt of Love defray. Hence to Loves secret Temples let's retire, There on his Altars kindle th' Am'rous fire, Then Phœnix-like Each in the flame expire. Still he is fixt— [Looking on D. Carlos. —Gomez observe the Prince, [To R. Gomez. Yet smile on me my charming Excellence. Virgins should only fears and blushes show, But you must lay aside that Title now. The Doctrine which I preach by Heav'n is good; Oh! the Impetuous sallyes of my Blood! Queen. To what unwelcome Joyes I'm forc't to yield, Now fate her utmost malice has fulfill'd. Carlos farewel: for since I must submit— King. Now wing'd with rapture let us fly my sweet. My Son all Troubles from thy breast resigne, And let thy Father's happiness be thine. Exeunt K. and Q. attended. D. C. What King, what God would not his pow'r forgo, T'enjoy so much Divinity below? Did'st Thou behold her Posa— Posa. Sir I did. D. Car. And is she not a sweet one? such a Bride, Oh Posa once she was Decreed for mine. Once I had hopes of Bliss; hadst thou but seen How blest, how proud I was, if I could get But leave to lye a prostrate at her feet. Ev'n with a look I could my pains beguile, Nay she in pitty too would sometimes smile; Till at the last my vows successful prov'd, And one day sighing she confess'd she lov'd, Oh! then I found no limits to our joy, With Eyes thus languishing we lookt all day, So vigorous and strong we darted beams, Our meeting glances kindled into flames, Nothing we found that promis'd not delight, For when rude shades depriv'd us of the light, As we had gaz'd all day, we dreamt all night; But after all these Labours undergone, A cruel Father thus destroys his Son; In their full height my choicest hopes beguiles, And robs me of the fruit of all my Toyles My dearest Posa thou wer't ever kind, Bring thy best Counsel and direct my mind. Enter Gomez. R. Go. Still he is here My Lord. D. Car. —Your business now? R. Go. I've with concern beheld your Clouded brow; Ah! though y'ave lost a Beauty well might make Your strictness honour, and your duty shake, Let not a Fathers ills misguide your mind, But be Obedient, though he's prov'd unkind: D. Car. Hence Cynick to dull Slaves thy Morals teach, I have no leisure now to hear thee Preach; Still you'l usurp a power o're my will: R. Go. Sir you my Service do interpret ill; Nor need it be so soon forgot, that I Have been your Guardian from your Infancy, When to my charge committed, I alone Instructed you how to expect a Crown; Taught you Ambition, and Wars noblest Arts, How to lead Armies, and to Conquer Hearts. Whilst though but Young,— You would with pleasure read of Sieges got, And smile to hear of bloody Battles fought; And still, though not controul, I may advise, D. Car. Alas thy Pride wears a too thin disguise; Too well I know the Falshood of thy Soul, Which to my Father render'd me so foul; That hardly as his Son, a smile I've known, But always as a Traytor met his frown; My forward Honour was Ambition call'd, Or if my friends my early Fame extoll'd, You dampt my Fathers smiles still as they sprung, Perswading I repin'd he liv'd too long; So all my hopes by you were frustrate made, And rob'd of Sun-shine, wither'd in the shade. Whilst my good Patriot! you dispos'd the Crown Out of my reach, to have it in your own: But i'le prevent your Policy— R. Go. —My Lord, This accusation is unjust and hard; The King your Father would not so upbraid My age, is all my service thus repaid? But I will hence and let my Master hear How generously you reward my care, Who on my just complaint, I doubt not, will At last redress the Injuries I feel. [Exit Gomez. Po. Alas my Lord you too severely urge Your Fate, his Interest with the King is large; Besides, you know he has already seen The Transports of your passion for the Queen; The use he may of that advantage make, You ought at least t'avoid, but for her sake. D. Car. Ah! my dear friend, th'ast toucht my tend'rest part, I never yet learnt the dissembling Art; Go call him back, tell him that I implore His pardon; and will nere offend him more: The Queen! kind Heaven make her thy nearest care: Oh! fly, o're take him e're he goes too far. [Exit Posa. How are we bandied up and down by Fate, By so much more unhappy as w'are great; A Prince, and heir to Spains great Monarch born, I'm forc't to Court a Slave whom most I scorn; Who like a Bramble 'mongst a Cedars boughs, Vexes his Peace, under whose shade he grows; Re-enter R. Gomez and Posa. Now he returns, assist me Falshood,—down Thou Rebel passion— Sir I fear I've done [To R. Gomez. You wrong; but if I have you can forgive. Heaven! can I do this abject thing and live? [aside. R. Go. Ah! my good Lord it makes too large amends, When to his Vassal thus a Prince descends: Tho it was something rigid, and unkind T'upbraid your faithful Servant and your friend. D. Car. Alas no more: all Jealousies shall cease Between us two, let there be henceforth Peace; So may Just Heav'n assist me when I sue, As I to Gomez always will be true: R. Go. Stay Sir, and for this mighty favour take All the return sincerity can make Blest in you Fathers love, as I'm in yours, May not one fear disturb your happy hours; Crown'd with success may all your wishes be, And you ne're find worse Enemies than me: [Exeunt Car. and Posa. Nor spight of all his greatness shall he need Of too long date, his ruine is decreed; Spains early hopes of him have been my fears, 'Twas I the charge had of his tender years, And read in all the Progress of his growth An untam'd, haughty, hot and furious Youth, A Will unruly, and a Spirit wild, At all my precepts still with scorn he smil'd; Or when by th'power I from his Father had, Any restraint was on his pleasures laid, Usher'd with frowns on me his soul would rise, And threaten future vengeance from his Eyes: But now to all my fears I bid adieu, For Prince I'le humble both your Fate and you; Here comes the Star by whom my course I steer, [Enter Eboli. Welcome my Love.— Eboli. My Lord why stay you here Losing the pleasure of this happy night? When all the Court are melting in delight, You toyl with the dull bus'ness of the State. R. Go. Only my fair one, how to make thee great: Thou tak'st up all the bus'ness of my heart, And only to it pleasures canst impart: Say say, my Goddess, when shall I be blest? It is an Age since I was happy last. Eboli. My Lord I come not hither now to hear Your love, but offer something to your Ear; If you have well observ'd, you must have seen To day some strange disorders in the Queen. R. Go. Yes such as Youthful Brides do still express, Impatient Longings for the happiness; Approaching Joyes will so disturb the Soul, As Needles alwaies Tremble near the Pole. Ebol. Come, Come, my Lord: seem not so blind: too well I've seen the Wrongs which you from Carlos feel. And know your Judgment is too good, to loose Advantage, where you may so safely choose. Say now if I inform you, how you may With full Revenge all your past Wrongs repay. R. Go. Blest Oracle! speak how it may be done, My will, my life, my hopes are all thy own. Eboli. Hence then and with your strictest cunning try What of the Queen and Prince you can descry. Watch every look, each quick, and subtle glance, Then we'l from all produce such Circumstance As shall the King's new Jealousie advance. Nay Sir, I'l try what mighty Love you show: If you will make me great, begin it now. How Sir! d'you stand Consid'ring what to do? R. Go. No, but methinks I view from hence a King, A Queen and Prince, three goodly Flowers spring, Whilst on 'em like a subtle Bee I'l prey, Till so their Strength and Vertue drawn away, Unable to recover each shall droop, Grow pale and fading hang his Wither'd Top, Then fraught with Thyme Triumphant back I'l come And unlade all the pretious sweets at home. [Exit Gomez. Eboli. In thy fond policy Blind fool go on, And make what hast thou canst to be undone, Whilst I have nobler bus'ness of my own. Was I bred up in Greatness, have I been Nurtur'd with glorious hopes to be a Queen? Made love my study, and with Practic'd Charms Prepar'd my self to meet a Monarch's Arms? At last to be Condemn'd to the Embrace Of one, whom Nature made to her disgrace? An old Imperfect feeble dotard, who Can only tell Alas! what he would do? On him to throw away my Youth, and Bloom, As Jewels that are lost, t'enrich a Tomb? No, though all hopes are in a husband dead, Another path to happiness I'l tread, Elsewhere find Joyes which I'm in him deny'd: Yet while he can let the slave serve my pride. Still I'l in pleasure live, In Glory shine: The gallant Youthful Austria shall be mine. To him with all my force of Charms I'l move; Let others toyl for Greatness: whilst I love. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Second. SCENE the First. Don John of Austria. SCENE, An ORANGE GROVE. D. J. Why should dull Law rule Nature, who first made That Law, by which her self is now betray'd: E're man's Corruptions made him wretched, he Was born most noble that was born most free: Each of himself was Lord; and unconfin'd Obey'd the dictates of his Godlike mind. Law was an Innovation brought in since, When Fools began to love Obedience, And call'd their slavery Safety and defence. My Glorious Father got me in his heat, When all he did was eminently great. When Warlike Belgia felt his Conquering power, And the proud Germans Own'd him Emperour. Why should it be A Stain upon my Blood Because I came not in the Common Road, But Born obscure and so more like a God. No; Though his Diadem Another wear, At least to all his Pleasures I'le be Heir. Here I should meet my Eboli, my fair [Enter Eboli. She comes: As the Bright Cyprian Goddess moves, When Loose and In her Chariot drawn by Doves, She rides to meet the Warlike God she Loves. Ebol. Alas, my Lord, you know not with what fear And Hazard, I am come to meet you here. D. J. O banish it: Lovers like us should fly, And mounted by their wishes soar on high, Where softest extasies and Transports are, While fear alone disturbs the Lower Ayre. Eboli. But who is safe when Eyes are Every where? Or if we could with happiest secresy Enjoy these sweets; Oh whither shall we fly T'Escape that sight whence we can nothing hide! D. J. Alas lay this Religion now Aside, I'le show thee one more pleasant, that which Jove Set forth to the old World, when from above He came himself and taught his Mortals Love. Eboli. Will nothing then Quench your unruly flame? My Lord, you might consider who I am. D. J. I know y'are her I love, what should I more Regard?— Ebol. —By heaven he's brave— [aside. But can so poor A Thought possess your breast, to think that I Will brand my name with Lust and Infamy. D. J. Those that are noblest born, should highest prize Loves sweets; Oh let me fly into those Eyes, There's something in 'em leads my Soul astray, As he who in a Negromancer's glass Beholds his wish't for fortune by him pass, Yet still with greedy Eyes— Pursues the Vision as it glides away. Eboli. Protect me Heaven, I dare no longer stay, Your looks speak danger: I feel something too That bids me fly, yet will not let me go. [half aside D. J. Take Vows and Prayers if ever I prove false, See at your feet the humble Austria falls. [Kneels. Eboli. Rise, Rise [Austria rises. My Lord why would you thus deceive? [Sighs. D. J. How many ways to wound me you contrive; Speak, wouldst thou have an Empire at thy feet? Say, wouldst thou rule the world? I'le Conquer it. Eboli. No above Empire far I could prize you, If you would be but— D. J. —What? Eboli. —For ever true. D. J. That thou may'st ne're have cause to fear those harms, I'le be confin'd for ever in thy Arms; Nay, I'le not one short minute from thee stray, My self I'le on thy tender bosome lay, Till in its warmth I'm melted all away. Enter Garcia. Gar. Madam, Your Lord— Eboli. —Oh! fly or I'm undone: Kisses her Hand. D. J. Must I without my blessing then be gone? Eboli. Think you that this discretion merits one? [pulls it back. D. J. I'm aw'd— As a sick wretch that on his death-bed lyes Loath with his friends to part, just as he dies, Thus sends his Soul in wishes from his eyes. Exit D. J. Eboli. Oh Heaven! what charms in youth and vigour are? Yet he in Conquest is not gone too far; Too easily I'le not my self resign, E're I am his, I'le make him surely mine; Draw him by subtile baits into the Trap, Till so too far got in to make escape, About him swiftly the soft snare I'le cast, And when I have him there I'le hold him fast. Enter Rui. Gomez. R. Go. Thus unaccompany'd I subtilly range The Solitary paths of dark revenge: The fearful Deer in herds to Coverts run, Whilst Beasts of prey affect to Roam alone. Eboli. Ah! my dear Lord, how do you spend your hours? You little think what my poor heart endures; Whilst with your absence tortur'd, I in vain Pant after joys I ne're can hope to gain. R. Go. You cannot my unkindness sure upbraid; You should forgive those faults your self have made: Remember you the task you gave?— Eboli. —'Tis true, Your pardon, for I do remember now: [Sighs If I forgot, 'twas love had all my mind, And 'tis no sin I hope to be too kind. R. Go. How happy am I in a faithful Wife! Oh! thou most pretious blessing of my Life! Eboli. Do's then success attend upon your toyl? I long to see you Revel in the spoyl. R. Go. What strictest diligence could do, I've done, T'incense an angry Father 'gainst his Son; I to advantage told him all that past, Describ'd with Art, each Am'rous glance they cast; So that this night he shun'd the marriage bed, Which through the Court has various murmurs spread. Enter the King attended by Posa. See where he comes with fury in his Eyes, Kind Heaven but grant the storm may higher rise; If't grow too loud I'le lurk in some dark Cell, And laugh to hear my Magick work so well. King. What's all my Glory? all my Pomp? how poor Is fading greatness, or how vain is pow'r: Where all the mighty Conquests I have seen? I who o're Nations have Victorious been, Now cannot quell one little Foe within. Curst Jealousie; that poysons all Loves sweets, How heavy on my heart th'invader sits: Oh! Gomez thou hast given my mortal wound: R. Go. What is't does so your royal thoughts confound? A King his power unbounded ought to have, And ruling all, should not be passions slave. King. Thou counsell'st well, but art no stranger sure To the sad cause of what I now endure. Knowst thou what Poison thou didst lately give? And do'st not wonder to behold me live? R. Go. I only did as by my duty ty'd, And never study'd any thing beside. King. I do not blame thy duty or thy Care; Quickly what past between 'em more declare. How greedily my Soul to ruine flyes, As he who in a Feavour burning lyes, First of his Friends does for a drop implore, Which tasted once unable to give 'ore: Knows 'tis his bane, yet still thirsts after more. On then— R. Go. —I fear that you'l Interpret wrong! 'Tis true, they gaz'd, but 'twas not very long. King. Lye still my heart; not long was't that you said? R. G. No longer then they in your presence staid. King. No longer! why a Soul in less time flyes To Heaven: and they have chang'd theirs at their Eyes. Hence abject fears begone: she's all divine: Speak Friends, can Angels in perfection sin? R. Go. Angels that shine above do oft bestow Their Influence on poor Mortals here below. King. But Carlos is my Son, and alwaies near; Seems to move with me in my glorious Sphear. True, she may showr promiscuous blessings down On slaves that gape for what falls from a Crown. But when too kindly she his brightness sees, It robs my Lustre to add more to his: But oh I dare not think— That those Eyes should at least so humble be, To stoop at him when they had vanquisht me. Posa. Sir, I am proud to think I know the Prince, That he of Virtue has too great a sence To cherish but a thought beyond the bound Of strictest duty: He to me has Own'd How much was to his former passion due, Yet still confess'd he above all priz'd you. R. Go. You better reconcile Sir, then advise; Be not more Charitable then y'are wise: The King is sick, and we should give him Ease, But first find out the depth of his Disease: Too sudden cures have oft pernicious grown, We must not heal up festered wounds too soon. King. By this then you a power would o're me gain; Wounding to let me linger in the pain: I'm stung, and won't the torture long endure; Serpents that wound, have blood those wounds to cure. R. Go. Good Heaven forbid that I should ever dare To Question Virtue in a Queen so fair. Though she her Eyes cast on her Glorious Sun, Men oft see Treasures and yet covet none. King. Think not to blind me with dark Ironies, The Truth disguis'd in Obscure Contraries. No, I will trace his windings, All her dark And subtlest paths, Each little Action mark: Enter Queen Att. Henrietta. If she prove false as yet I fear she dyes: Ha! here! oh let me turn away my Eyes. For all around she'l her bright beams display: Should I to gaze on the wild Meteor stay, 'Spight of my self I shall be led astray. Exit the King Attend. looking at the Queen. Queen. How scornfully he is withdrawn! Sure e're his Love hee'd let me know his power: As Heaven oft Thunders 'ere it sends a shower. This Spanish Gravity is very odd All things are by severity so Aw'd, That little Love dares hardly peep abroad. Henr. Alas, what can you from old age expect, When frail uneasie men themselves neglect? Some little warmth perhaps may be behind, Though such as in extinguisht fires you'l find: Where some remains of heat the ashes hold, Which (if for more you open) staight are cold. Queen. 'Twas Interest and Safety of the State; Interest that bold Imposer on our fate: That alwaies to dark Ends misguides our wills, And with false happiness smooths o're our ills. It was by that unhappy France was led, When though by Contract I should Carlos wed, I was an Offering made to Philip's Bed. [Henr. sighs. Why sigh'st thou Henrietta? Henriett. Who is it can Know your sad fate and yet from grief refrain? With pleasure oft I've heard you smiling tell Of Carlos Love. Queen. —And did it please you well? In that brave Prince's Courtship there did meet All that we could obliging call or sweet. At every point he with advantage stood: Fierce as a Lyon if provok'd abroad; Else, soft as Angels, Charming as a God. Henr. One so Accomplisht! and who lov'd you too! With what resentments must he part with you? Methinks I pity him.—But oh in vain! He's both above my pity and my pain. [aside. Queen. What means this strange disorder? Henr. —Yonder view, Enter D. Carlos. Posa. That which I fear will discompose you too. Queen. Alas! the Prince! there to my mind appears Something that in me moves unusual fears: Away Henrietta.— [offers to go. D. Car. —Why would you begone? Is Carlos sight ungrateful to you grown. If 'tis, speak. In Obedience I'le retire. Qu. No, you may speak, but must advance no nigher. D. Car. Must I then at that Awful distance sue, As our forefathers were Compel'd to do When they petitions made at that great Shrine, Where none but the High Priest might enter in? Let me approach; I've nothing for your Ear, But what's so pure it might be Offer'd there. Qu. Too long 'tis dangerous for me here to stay; If you must speak, proceed: What would you say? Carlos kneels. Nay this strange Ceremony pray give ore. D. Car. Was I n'er in this posture seen before? Ah can your cruel heart so soon resign All sence of these sad sufferings of mine? To your more just remembrance if you can Recall how fate seem'd kindly to ordain, That once you should be mine: which I believ'd, Though now alas! I find I was deceiv'd. Queen. Then Sir you should your Fate, not me upbraid. D. Carl. I will not say y'ave broke the vows you made, Only implore you would not quite forget The Wretch ya've oft seen dying at your feet; And now no other favour begs to have, Then such Kind pity as becomes your slave. For 'midst your highest Joyes, without a Crime At least you now and then may think of him. Queen. If e're you lov'd me you would this forbear; It is a Language which I dare not hear: My Heart and Faith become your Fathers right, All other passions I must now forget. D. Car. Can then a Crown and Majesty dispence Upon your heart such mighty Influence, That I must be for ever banish'd thence. Had I been rais'd to all the heights of power, In Triumph Crown'd the Worlds great Emperour: Of all its riches, all its State possest, Yet you should still have govern'd in my breast. Qu. In vain on her you obligations lay, Who wants not will, but power to repay. Henriett. Yet had you Henrietta's heart, you would At least strive to afford him all you could. [aside. D. Carl. Oh say not you want pow'r, you may with one Kind look, pay doubly all I've undergone. And knew you but the Innocence I bear, How pure, how spotless all my wishes are; You would not scruple to supply my want, When all I'l ask you may so safely grant. Qu. I know not what to grant, too well I find That still at least I cannot be unkind. D. Car. Afford me then that little which I crave: Qu. You shall not want what I may let you have. Gives her hand sighing. D. Carl. Like one— That sees a heap of Gems before him cast, Thence to chuse any that may please him best: From the rich Treasure whilst I choice should make, Dazzel'd withal I know not where to take: I would be rich— Qu. —Nay you too far encroach, I fear I have already giv'n too much. [Turns from him. D. Carl. Oh take not back again th'appearing bliss; How difficult's the path to happiness! Whilst up the Precipice we climb with pain, One little slip throwes us quite down again. Stay, Madam, though you nothing more can give, Then just enough to keep a wretch alive; At least remember how I've lov'd— Qu. —I will. D. Car. That was so kind, that I must beg more still. Let me love on, it is a very poor And easie grant, yet I'l request no more. Qu. Do you believe that you can love retain, And not expect to be belov'd again. D. Carl. Yes I will love, and think I'm happy too, So long as I can find that you are so: All my disquiets banish from my breast; I will endeavour to do so at least. [Sighing deeply. Or if I can't my miseries out-wear, They never more shall come t'offend your Ear. Qu. Love then Brave Prince, whilst I'l thy Love admire Gives her hand, which D. Carlos during all this speech kisses eagerly. Yet keep the Fame so pure, such chast desire, That without spot hereafter we above May meet when we shall come all soul all love. Till when—Oh whither am I run astray! I grow too weak and must no longer stay: For should I, the soft charm so strong would grow, I find that I should want the power to go. Exit Qu. &amp; Henrietta. D. Carl. Oh Sweet— If such transport be in a tast so small, How blest must he be that possesses all! Where am I Posa? Where's the Queen? [standing amazed. Posa. —My Lord, A while some respite to your heart afford, The Queen's retir'd— D. Carl. —Retir'd! and did she then, Just show me Heaven, to shut it in agen? This little ease augments my pain the more; For now, I'me more Impatient than before, And have discover'd Riches, make me mad. Posa. But since those Treasures are not to be had, You should correct desires that drive you on, Beyond that duty which becomes a Son: No longer let the Tyrant Love Invade, The Brave may by themselves be happy made. You to your Father now must all resign. D. Carl. But e're he rob'd me of her she was mine. To be my Friend is all thou hast to do: For half my miseries thou can'st not know: Make my self happy! bid the damn'd do so; Who in sad Flames, must be for ever tost, Yet still in view of the lov'd Hea'vn th'ave lost. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Third. SCENE the First. Don John of Austria. The GROVE continues. D. J. How vainly would dull Moralists Impose Limits on Love, whose Nature brooks no Laws: Love is a God, and like a God should be Inconstant: with unbounded liberty Rove as he list— I find it: for ev'n now I've had a Feast, Of which a God might Covet for a tast. Methinks I yet— See with what soft devotion in her eyes, The tender Lamb came to the Sacrifice. Oh how her Charms, surpriz'd me as I lay! Like too near sweets they took my sence away: And I ev'n lost the pow'r to reach at Joy. But those cross withcrafts soon unravell'd were, And I was lull'd in Trances sweeter far: As Anchor'd Vessels in Calm Harbours ride, Rock't on the swellings of the floating Tide. How wretched then's the man who though alone He thinks he's blest; yet as Confin'd to one, Is but at best a pris'ner on a Throne. To him King Attended. Posa. Gomez. King. Ye mighty Powr's! whose substitutes we are, On whom y'ave layn of Earth the rule and care: Why all our Toyles do you reward with ill? And to those Weighty Cares add Greater still? Or how could I your Dieties enrage, That bles't my youth, thus to afflict my age! A Queen and a Son's Incest! dismal Thought! D. J. What is't so soon his Majesty has brought To Gomez. From the soft Arms of his young Bride? King. —Ay true. Is she not Austria young and Charming too? Dost thou not think her to a wonder fair? Tell me.— D. J. —By Heav'n more bright than Planets are; Her Beauties force might ev'n their pow'r Out-do. King. Nay she's as false and as unconstant too. Oh Austria, that a form so outward bright, Should be within all dark and ugly night. For she, to whom I'd dedicated all My Love, that dearest Jewel of my Soul: Takes from its shrine the pretious Relique down, T'adorn a little Idol of her Own, My Son! That Rebel both to Heav'n and me! Oh the distracting throwes of Jealousie! But as a drowning wretch just like to sink, Seeing him that threw him in upon the brink: At the third plunge layes hold upon his Foe, And tugs him down into destruction too, So thou from whom these miseries I've known, Shall bear me out again, or with me drown. Seizes roughly on Rui-Gomez. R. Go. My Loyalty will teach me how to wait All the Successes of my Soveraign's fate. What is't, Great Sir, you wou'd command me! King. How!— —What is't?—I know not what I'd have thee do; Study revenge for me, 'tis that I want. D. John. Alas! what frenzy does your temper haunt! Revenge! on whom! King. On my false Queen and Son. R. Go. On them! good heav'n what is't that they have done, Oh had my tongue been curst e're it had bred This Jealousie— [half aside. King. —Then cancel what tha'st said. Did'st thou not tell me, that thou saw'st him stand, Printing soft vowes, in kisses on her hand: Whilst in requital she such glances gave, Would quicken a Dead Lover in his Grave. R. Go. I did: and what less could the Queen allow To him, then you to every vassal show: Th'affording him that little from Loves store, Imply'd that she for you reserv'd much more. King. Oh doubtless she must have a woundrous store Of Love, that sells it at a rate so poore. Now Thoud'st rebate my passion with advise, And when thou shouldst be active, wouldst be wise, No, lead me where I may their Incest see. Do: or by heav'n—do and I'le worship Thee! Oh how my Passions drive me to and fro! Under their heavy weight, I yield and bow. But I'le regather yet my strength, and stand Brandishing all my Thunder in my hand. Posa. And may it be sent forth and where it goes, Light fatally and heavy on your foes. But let your Loyal Son, and Consort, bear No ill, since they of any guiltless are. Here with my Sword defiance I proclaim, To that bold Traytor, that dares wrong their fame. D. J. I too, dare with my life their Cause make good. King. Sure well their Innocence y'ave understood, That you so prodigal are of your blood. Or wouldst thou speak me comfort? I would find 'Mongst all my Councellors at least one kind. Yet any thing like that I must not hear, (Or so my wrongs I should too tamely bear) And weakly grow my own fond flatterer. Posa, withdraw— [Exit Posa. My Lords, all this y'have heard. R. Go. Yes, I observ'd it Sir, with strict regard. The Young Lord's Friendship was too great to hide. King. Is he then so to my false Son ally'd? I am environ'd ev'ry way, and all My Fates unhappy Engines plot my fall, Like Cæsar in the Senate, thus I stand, Whilst ruine threaten'd him on ev'ry hand. From each side he had warning he must dye; Yet still he brav'd his Fate, and so will I. To strive for ease would but add more to pain, As streams that beat against their banks in vain Retreating swell into a Flood again. No, I'le do things the World shall quake to hear, My just revenge so true a stamp shall bear. As henceforth Heav'n it self shall emulate, And copy all its vengeance out by that. All but Rui-Gomez I must have withdrawn, I've something to discourse with him alone. [Ex. omnes præter K. &amp; Gomez. Now Gomez on thy truth depends thy fate, Thou'st wrought my sence of Wrong to such a height: Within my breast it will no longer stay, But grows each minute till it force its way. I would not find my self at last deceiv'd. R. Go. Nor would I 'gainst your reason be believ'd; Think Sir your Jealousie to be but fear Of loosing treasures which you hold so dear: Your Queen and Son may yet be innocent, I know but what they did, not what they meant. King. Meant? what should looks and sighs and pressings mean? No, no: I need not hear it o're again. No repetitions—something must be done. Now there's no ill I know that I would shun. I'l fly till them I've in their Incest found Full charg'd with rage and with my vengeance hot, Like a Granado from a Cannon shot, Which lights at last upon the Enemies ground, Then breaking deals destruction all around. [Ex. King. R. Go. So! now his Jealousie is at the Top; Each little blast will serve to keep it up. But stay; there's something I've omitted yet, Posa's my Enemy: and true he's great. Alas! I'm arm'd 'gainst all that he can do; For my snare's large enough to hold him too. Yet, I'le disguise that purpose for a while: But when he with the rest is caught i'th Toile, I'le boldly out and wanton in the spoile. Enter Posa. Posa. My Lord Rui-Gomez! and the King not here! You who so eminent a Favourite are. In a King's Eye, should ne're be absent thence. R. Go. No Sir! 'tis you that by a rising Prince Are cherish't, and so tread a safer way: Rich in that bliss the World waits to enjoy. Posa. Since what may bless the World we ought to prize, I wish there were no publick enemies. No lurking Serpents poyson to dispence, Nor Wolves to prey on noble Innocence. No flatterers that with Royal goodness sport, Those stinking weeds that over-run a Court. R. Go. Nay; if good wishes any thing could do; I have as earnest wishes Sir as you. That tho' perhaps our King enjoyes the best Of power, yet may he still be doubly blest. May he— Posa. Nay Gomez you shall ne're out-do me there; Since for Great Philip's good I wou'd you were (If possible) more honest then you are. R. Go. Why Posa; what defect can you discern? Posa. Nay half your mysteries I'm yet to learn: Tho' this I'l boldly justifie to all, That you contrive a generous Prince's fall. [Gom. smiles. Nay think not by your smiles, and careless port, To laugh it off: I come not here to sport. I do not Sir. R. Go. Young Lord! what meaning has This heat? Posa. To let you see I know y'are base. R. Go. Nay then I pardon ask that I did smile, By heav'n I thought, y'had jested all this while. Base!— Posa. Yes! more base then impotent or old, All vertue in thee, like thy blood, runs cold; Thy rotten putrid Carkass is less full, Of Rancor and Contagion then thy Soul. Even now, before the King I saw it plain, But duty to that Presence aw'd me then; Yet there I dar'd thy Treason with my Sword, But still— Thy Villany talk't all; Courage had not a word. True thou art old; yet if thou hast a Friend, To whom thy Cursed Cause thou dar'st commend; 'Gainst him in publick I'le the Innocence Maintain, of the fair Queen, and injur'd Prince. R. Go. Farewel bold Champion— Learn better how your passions to disguise, Appear less Cholerick, and be more wise. [Exit R. Go. Posa. How frail is all the glory we design? Whilst such as these have pow'r to undermine. Unhappy Prince who might'st have safely stood, If thou hadst been less great, or not so good. Why the vile Monster's blood did I not shed, And all the vengeance draw on my own head? My honour so, had had this just defence, That I preserv'd my Patron and my Prince. Enter Carlos and Queen. Brave Carlos! ha! he's here! O Sir take heed. By an unlucky Fate your Love is led; The King, the King your Father's jealous grown, Forgetting her, his Queen, or you his Son, Calls all his vengeance up, against you both. D. Carl. Has then the false Rui-Gomez broke his Oath? And after all, my Innocence betrayd? Posa. Yes? all his subtlest snares are for you laid, The King within this minute will be here, And you are ruin'd if but seen with her; Retire my Lord.— Queen. How! is he jealous grown! I thought my Virtue he had better known. His unjust doubts have soon found out the way, To make their entry on our Marriage day: For yet he has not with me known a night; Perhaps his Tyranny is his delight. And to such height his Cruelty is grown, He'd Exercise it on his Queen and Son. But since my Lord, this time we must obey, Our Interest; I begg you would not stay. Not seeing you he may to me be just. D. Carl. Should I then leave you, Madam? Queen. Yes! you must. D. Carl. Not then, when storms against your Virtue rise! No, since to lose you, wretched Carlos dies, He'l have the honour of it, in your Cause. This is the noblest thing that Fate could do, She thus abates the rigour of her Lawes. Since 'tis some pleasure but to dye for you. Queen. Talk not of death, for that ev'n Cowards dare, When their base fears compel e'm to despair. Hope's the far nobler passion of the Mind, Fortune's a Mistriss that's with Caution kind, Knows that the constant merit her alone; They, who though she seem froward, yet court on. D. Carl. To wretched minds thus still some comfort gleames, And Angels ease our griefs though but with dreames; I have too oft already been deceiv'd, And the Cheats grown too plain to be believ'd. You Madam, bid me go. Looking earnestly at the Queen. Queen. You must. Posa. You shall; Alas I love you, would not see you fall: And yet may find some way t'evade it all. D. Carl. Thou Posa ever wert' my truest Friend, I almost wish thou wert not now so kind; Thou, of a thing that's lost tak'st too much care; And you fair Angel too indulgent are. [To the Queen. Great my despair; yet still my Love is higher— Well—in obedience to you I'le retire. Though during all the Storm I will be nigh, Where if I see the danger grow too high, To save yon Madam, I'le come forth and and dye. Exit D. Carlos. Enter King and Rui-Gomez. King. Who would have guess't that this had ever been? Seeing Posa and the Queen. Distraction! where shall my revenge begin? Why he's the very Bawd to all their sin? And to disguise it put's on Friendships mask, But his Dispatch, Rui-Gomez is thy task; With him pretend some private conference, And under that disguise seduce him hence; Then in some place fit for the Deed impart The bus'ness by a Ponyard to his Heart. R. G. 'Tis done. King. So Madam!— [Steps to the Queen. Queen. —By the fury in your eyes, I understand you come to tyrannize. I hear you are already Jealous grown, And dare suspect my Virtue with your Son. King. Oh Woman-kind! thy Myst'ries! who can scan Too deep for easie weak believing man! Hold! let me look! indeed y'are wondrous fair, So on the out-side Sodoms Apples were. And yet within, when open'd to the view, Not half so dang'rous, or so foul, as you. Queen. Unhappy Wretched Woman that I am, And you unworthy of a Husband's name? Do you not blush?— King. Yes Madam for your shame. Blush too my Judgment e're should prove so faint, To let me chuse a Devil for a Saint. When first I saw, and lov'd, that tempting eye, The Fiend within the flame I did not spy; But still ran on and Cherish't my desires: For heav'nly Beams mistook Infernal fires. Such raging fires, as you have since thought fit Alone my Son, my Son's hot Youth, should meet. Oh Vengeance, Vengeance!— Queen. —Poor Ungen'rous King! How mean's the Soul from which such thoughts must spring! Was it for this I did so late submit, To let you whine and languish at my feet? When with false Oaths you did my heart beguile, And proffer'd all your Empire for a smile. Then, then, my freedom 'twas I did resign, Though you still swore you would preserve it mine. And still it shall be so: For from this hour I vow to hate, and never see you more. Nay frown not Philip, for you soon shall know I can resent and rage as well as you. King. By Hell her pride's as Raging as her lust: A Guard there—Seize the Queen— [Enter Guard. Enter Carlos and Intercepts the Guard. D. Carl. —Hold Sir be Just. First look on me whom once You call'd your Son. A Title I was alwaies proud to own. King. Good Hea'vn to merit this what have I done? That he too dares before my sight appear. D. Carl. Why Sir, where is the Cause that I should fear? Bold in my Innocence, I come to know The reason, why you use this Princess so. King. Sure I shall find some way to raise this siege: He talks as if 'twere for his Priviledge. Foul ravisher of all my Honour hence: But stay: Guards with the Queen secure the Prince. Wherefore in my Revenge should I be slow? Now in my reach, I'l dash 'em at a Blow. Enter D. John of Austria; Eboli and Henriett. Garcia. D. J. I come Great Sir, with wonder here, to see Your rage grown up to this Extremity Against your beauteous Queen, and Loyal Son. What is't that they to merit Chains have done? Or is't your own wild Jealousie alone? King. Oh Austria thy vain Enquiry Cease, If thou hast any value for thy peace; My mighty Wrongs so loud an accent bear; 'Twould make thee miserable but to hear. D. Carl. Father, if I may dare to call you so, Since now I doubt if I'm your Son or no: As you have seal'd my doom I may Complain. King. Will then that Monster dare to speak again? D. Car. Yes: dying men should not their thoughts disguise; And since You take such Joy in Cruelties; E're of my death the new delight begin, Be pleas'd to hear how cruel You have been. Time was that we were smil'd on by our fate, You not Unjust, nor I unfortunate. Then, then, I was your Son, and you were glad To hear my early praise was talk't abroad. Then Loves dear sweets you to me would display, Told me where this rich Beauteous Treasure lay, And how to gain't instructed me the way. I came, and saw, and lov'd, and blest you for't. But then when Love had seal'd her to my heart, You Violently tore her from my side: And 'cause my Bleeding Wound I could not hide, But still some pleasure to behold her took; You now will have my life but for a look. Wholly forgetting all the pains I bore, Your heart with envious Jealousie boyles ore, 'Cause I can love no less, and you no more. Hen. Alas! how can you hear his soft Complaint, And not your hardned stubborn heart relent? Turn Sir, survey that comely awful man, And to my Pray'rs be cruel if you can. King. Away deluder: who taught thee to sue? Eboli. Loving the Queen what is't she less can do, Then lend her aid against the dreadful storm? King. Why can the Devil dwell too in that form? This is their little Engine by the by, A Scout to watch, and tell when danger's nigh. Come pretty sinner Thou'lt inform me all, How, where, and when, nay do not fear—you shall Hen. Ah Sir Unkind!— [Kneels. King. —Now hold thy Syrens Tongue. Who would have thought there were a Witch so young? D. J. Can you to suing Beauty stop your Ears? Hea'vn layes its Thunder by, and gladly hears Takes up Hen. and makes his address to her. When Angels are become petitioners. Eboli. Ha! what makes Austria so officious there! That glance seems as it sent his heart to her. aside to Garcia. D. Carl. A Banquet then of blood since you design, Yet you may satisfie your self with mine. I love the Queen, I have confest 'tis true: Proud too to think I love her more than you; Though she by Heav'n is clear—but I indeed Have been unjust, and do deserve to bleed. There were no lawless thoughts that I did want, Which Love had pow'r to ask, or Beauty grant. Tho' I ne're yet found hopes to raise 'em on, For she did still preserve her Honours Throne: And dash'd the bold aspiring Devil's down. If to her Cause you do not credit give Fondly against your happiness you'l strive, As some loose Heav'n because they won't believe. Queen. Whilst Prince, my preservation you design, Blot not your Virtue to add more to mine. The clearness of my truth I'd not have shown, By any other light besides its Own, No Sir, he through despair all this has said, And owns Offences which he never made. Why should you think that I would do you wrong? Must I needs be Unchast because I'm young? King. Unconstant Wav'ring heart why heav'st thou so? I shiver all, and know not what I do. I who e're now have Armies led to fight, Thought War a Sport, and danger a delight: Whole Winter nights stood under Heav'ns wide roof Daring my foes: now am not Beauty proof. Oh turn away those Basilisks thy Eyes, Th'Infection's fatal, and who sees 'em, dyes. [Goes away. Qu. Oh do not fly me; I have no design Upon your life, for You may yet save mine. [Kneels. Or if at last I must my Breath submit, Here take it, 'tis an off'ring at your feet. Will you not look on me my dearest Lord? King. Why would'st Thou live!— Qu. Yes, if You'l say the Word. D. Carl. Oh Heav'n! how Coldly, and unmov'd, he sees A praying Beauty prostrate on her knees! Rise Madam— [Steps to take her up. King. —Bold Encroacher touch her not: Into my breast her glances thick are shot. Not true?—stay let me see,—By Heav'n Thou art Looks earnestly on her. —A false Vile Woman—Oh my foolish heart! I give thee life—But from this time refrain, And never come into my sight again: Be banish't ever.— Queen. —This you must not do, At least till I've convinc't you I am true. Grant me but so much time, and when that's done, If you think fit, for ever I'l be gone. King. I've all this while been angry but in vain; She heats me first, then stroaks me tame again. Oh wert thou true how happy should I be! Think'st Thou that I have Joy to part with thee? No, all my Kingdom for the bliss I'd give: Nay though it were not so but to believe. Come, for I can't avoid it, Cheat me quite. Qu. I would not Sir deceive you if I might, But if you'l take my Oaths; by all above 'Tis you, and only you that I will love. King. Thus as a Mariner that sailes along, With pleasure hears th'enticing Syrens Song, Unable quite his strong desires to bound, Boldly leaps in though certain to be drown'd. Come to my bosom then; make no delay: My rage is hush't, and I have room for Joy. Takes her in his Arms. Queen. Agen, you'l think that I unjust will prove? King. No Thou art all o're truth, and I all love. Oh that we might for ever thus remain In folded Arms, and never part again! Queen. Command me any thing, and try your pow'r. King. Then from this minute ne're see Carlos more. Thou slave that dar'st do ill with such a port, For ever here I banish thee my Court. Within some Cloyster lead a private life: That I may love and rule without this strife. Here Eboli receive her to thy Charge. The Treasure's pretious, and the trust is large, Whilst I retiring hence, my self make fit To wait for Joyes, which are too fierce to meet. [Exit King. D. Carl. My Exile from his presence I can hear With pleasure; But no more to look on her! Oh 'tis a dreadful Curse I cannot bear! No Madam, all his pow'r shall nothing do: I'l stay, and take my Banishment from you. Do you Command me, see how far I'l fly. Qu. Will Carlos be at last my Enemy? Consider this submission I have shown; More to preserve your safety then my own? Ungratefully you needless waies devise To loose a life, which I so dearly prize. D. Carl. So; now her fortune's made: and I am left [aside. Alone, a naked wanderer to shift: To the Queen. Madam you might have spar'd the Cruelty; Blest with your sight I was prepar'd to die: But now to loose it drives me to despair; Making me wish to die, and yet not dare. Well, to some solitary shoar I'l roam, And never more into your presence come: Since I already find I'm Troublesome. [is going. Qu. Stay, Sir, Yet stay:—You shall not leave me so. D. Carl. Ha!— Qu. —I must talk with you before you go. Oh Carlos how unhappy is our state? How foul a game was play'd us by our Fate! Who promis'd fair when we did first Begin, 'Till Envying to see us like to Win: Straight Fell to Cheat, and threw the false Lot in. My Vows to You I now remember all. D. Car. Oh Madam, I can hear no more.— [Kneels. Qu. —You shall.— [Kneels too. For I can't chuse but let you know, that I If you'l resolve on't Yet will with you die. D. Car. Sure nobler gallantry was never known Good Heav'n! this Blessing is too much for one No, 'tis enough for me to die alone. My Father, all my foes I now forgive. Queen. Nay Sir by all our Loves I charge You live; But to what Country, Wheresoe're You go, Forget not me, for I'l remember You. D. Carl. Shall I such Virtue, and such Charms forget? No, never— Queen. —Oh that we had never met. But in our distant Clymates still been free! I might have heard of you, and you of me: So towards happiness more safely mov'd; And never been thus wretched, Yet have lov'd. What makes you look so wildly?—why d'you start? D. Carl. A faint cold damp is Thick'ning round my heart. Queen. What shall we do?— D. Carl. —Do any thing but part. Or stay so long till my poor Soul expires: In View of all the Glory it admires. Eboli. In such a Lover how might I be bles't! Oh were I of that noble Heart possest, [aside. How soft, how easie would I make his bands! But Madam, You forgot the King's Commands: To the Queen. Longer to stay your dangers You'l Renew. D. Car. Ah Princess! Lovers pains you never knew; Or what it is to part as we must do. Part too for ever!— After one Minute, never more to stand Fix't on those Eyes, or pressing this soft hand; 'Twere but enough to feed on, and not starve: Yet that is more than I did e're deserve. Though fate to us is niggardly and poor; That from Eternity can't spare one hour. Qu. If it were had, that hour would soon be gone, And we should wish to draw another on. No, Rigorous necessity has made Us both his slaves; and now will be obey'd. Come let us try the parting blow to bear. Adieu.— D. Car. Farewell. [Looking at each other. —I'm fix't and rooted here, I cannot stir— Qu. Shall I the way then show? Now, hold my heart!— Goes to the door, then stops, and turns back again. —Nay Sir, why don't you go? D. Carl. Why do you stay?— Qu. I won't.— D. Car. —You shall a while [Kneels. With one look more my Miseries beguile, That may support my heart 'till you are gone. Qu. Oh Eboli thy help or I'm undone! [Takes hold on Eboli. Here take it then, and with it too my life. Leans into Eboli's arms. D. Car. My Courage with my Tortures is at strife: Since my griefs Cowards are, and dare not kill, I'l try to vanquish, and out-toyl the ill. Well Madam, now I'm something hardier grown; Since I at last perceive you must be gone: To venture the Encounter I'l be bold, Leads her to the door. For Cettainly my heart will so long hold. Farewel—be happy as y'are fair and true. Qu. And all Heav'ns kindest Angels wait on You. [Exit with Eboli. D. Carl. Thus long I wander'd in Loves crooked way, By hope's deluding Meteor, led astray: For e're I've half the dang'rous desart crost, The glimm'ring light's gone out, and I am lost. [Exit D. Carlos.

In vain I try, I must not venture in. Thus is it with the Souls of murder'd men; Who to their Bodies would agen repair, But finding that they cannot enter there, Mourning and groaning wander in the Aire. Rob'd of my Love, and as unjustly thrown From all those hopes that promis'd me a Crown, My heart, with the Dishonour's to me done, Is poison'd, swells too mighty for my breast; But it will break, and I shall be at rest. No: Dull despair this Soul shall never Load, Though Patience be the Virtue of a God: Gods never feel the ills that govern here, Or are above the Injuries we bear. Father! and King! both names bear mighty sence: Yet sure there's something too in Son, and Prince. I was born high, and will not fall less great, Since Triumph Crown'd my Birth! I'le have my Fate, As Glorious and Magestick too, as that. To Flanders Posa, strait my Letters send, Tell 'em the injur'd Carlos is their Friend. And that to head their Forces I design, So vindicate their Cause, if they dare mine. Posa. To th'Rebels!— D. Carlos. No, th'are Friends, their Cause is just, Or when I make it mine, at least, it must; Let th'Common Rout like Beasts Love to be Dull, Whilst sordidly they live at ease and full! Senceless what Honour or Ambition means, And ignorantly dragg their Load of Chains. I am a Prince have had a Crown in view, And cannot brook to loose the prospect now; If th'art my Friend, do not my will delay. Posa. I'le do't.— [Exit Posa. Enter Eboli. Ebol. My Lord! D. Carl. Who calls me? Ebol. You must stay. D. Carl. What newes of fresh affliction can you bear? Ebol. Suppose it were the Queen, you'd stay for her? D. Carl. For Her! Yes, stay an Age, for ever stay. Stay ev'n till time it self shou'd pass away! Fix here a Statue never to remove, An everlasting Monument of Love. Though, may a thing so wretched as I am, But the least place in her remembrance claym? Ebol. Yes; if you dare believe me Sir you do; We both can talk of nothing else but you: Whilst from the theame ev'n Emulation springs, Each striving who shall say the kindest things. D. Carl. But from that Charity I poorly live, Which only pities and can nothing give. Ebol. Nothing! propose! what 'tis you claim, and I, For ought you know may be security. D. Carl. No Madam! what's my due none e're can pay, There stands that Angel Honour in the way Watching his Charge with never sleeping eyes, And stops my Entrance into Paradice. Ebol. What Paradice! what Pleasures can you know Which are not in my power to bestow? D. Carl. Love! Love! and all those eager melting charms, The Queen must yield when in my Father's arms. That Queen so excellently richly fair, Jove could he come agen a Lover here Would Court Mortality to die for her. Oh Madam! take not pleasure to renew Those pains which if you felt you wou'd not do. Ebol. Unkindly urg'd: think you no sence I have Of what you feel? Now you may take your Leave; Something I had to say, but let it die. D. Carl. Why Madam, who has injur'd you? not I. Ebol. Nay Sir! your presence I would not Detain! Alas! you do not hear that I complain! Tho' could you half of my Misfortunes see, Methinks you should encline to pity me. D. Carl. I cannot guess what mournful tale you'd tell; But I am certain you prepare me well. Speak Madam!— Ebol. Say I lov'd, and with a flame Which even melts my tender heart to name; Lov'd too a man! I will not say ingrate, Because he's far above my Birth or Fate. Yet so far He at least does cruel prove, He prosecutes a dead and hopeless Love. Starves on a barren Rock, and won't be blest, Tho' I invite him kindly to a Feast. D. Carl. What stupid Animal could senceless lye, Quicken'd by beams from that Illustrious eye! Ebol. Nay to encrease your wonder you shall know That I, alas! am forc'd to tell him too: Till ev'n I blush as now I tell it you. D. Carl. You neither shall have cause of shame or fear, Whose Secrets safe within my Bosome are. Ebol. Then farther I the riddle may explain, Survey that Face, and blame me if you can! Shews him his own Picture. D. Carl. Distraction on my eyes what have they seen! 'Tis my own Picture which I sent the Queen. When to her Fame I paid Devotion first, Expecting bliss but lost it I am curs't. Curst too in thee, who from my Saint dar'st steal The onely Relique left her of my Zeal! And with the Sacriledg attempt my heart, Wer't thou more charming than thou think'st thou art! Almighty Love preserves the Fort for her, And bids defiance to thy Entrance there. Ebol. Neglected! scorn'd! by Father and by Son; What a malicious course my Stars have run? But since I meet with such unlucky Fate In love; I'le try how I can thrive in hate. My own dull Husband may assist in that: To his revenge I'le give him fresh alarms, [aside. And with the gray old Wizzard muster charms I hav't: Thanks, thanks Revenge: Prince 'tis thy bane! Can you forgive me Sir? I hope you can, [To Carl. mildly. I'l try to recompence the wrongs I've done, And better finish what is ill begun. D. Carl. Madam! you at so strange a rate proceed, I shall begin to think you Lov'd indeed. Ebol. No matter! be but to my Honour true, As you shall ever find I'le be to you. The Queens my charge, and you may on that score, Presume that you shall see her yet once more. I'l lead you to those so much worshipt charms; And yield you to my happy Rivals arms. D. Carl. In what a mighty Sum shall I be bound, I did not think such Virtue could be found. Thou Mistriss of all best perfections stay? Fain I in gratitude wou'd something say! But am too far in Debt for thanks to pay. Enter Don John of Austria. D. John. Where is that Prince, He whose afflictions speak, So loud as all Hearts but his own might break! D. Carl. My Lord! what Fate has left me I am here Mere man; of all my comforts strip't, and bare: Once like a Vine I flourish't, and was young, Rich in my ripening hopes that spoke me strong. But now a dry and wither'd stock am grown: And all my Clusters and my Branches gone. D. John. Amongst those numbers which your wrongs deplore, Then me, there's none that can resent e'm more. I feel a generous grudging in my breast, To see such honour and such hopes opprest. The King your Father is my Brother, true, But I see more that's like my self in you. Freeborn I am, and not on him depend: Oblig'd to none but whom I call my Friend. And if that Title you think fit to bear, Accept the Confirmation of it here. [Embrace. D. Carl. From you, to whom I'm by such Kindness ty'd, The secrets of my Soul I will not hide. This generous Princess has her promise giv'n, I once more shall be brought in sight of Heav'n. To the fair Queen my last Devotion pay, And then for Flanders I intend my way. Where to th'insulting Rebels I'le give Law, To keep my self from wrongs, and them in awe. D. John. Prosperity to the Design, 'Tis good; Both worthy of your Honour and your Blood. D. Carl. My Lord, your spreading Glories flourish high, Above the reach or shock of Destiny; Mine early nip't like Buds untimely dye. Enter Officer of the Guard. Offic. My Lord! I grieve to tell what you must hear, They are unwelcome Orders which I bear, Which are to guard you as a Prisoner. D. Carl. A pris'ner! what new game of Fate's begun? Henceforth be ever curs't the name of Son: Since I must be a Slave because I'm one. Duty! to whom? He's not my Father: no: Back with your Orders to the Tyrant go, Tell him his Fury drives too much one way; I'm weary on't, and can no more obey. D. John. If ask't by whose Commands you did decline Your Orders, Tell my Brother, 'Twas by mine. [Ex. Officer. D. Carl. Now were I certain it would sink me quite; I'd see the Queen once more Though but in spite. Tho' He wish all his fury were in place, I wou'd caress and court her to his face. Oh that I could this minute die, if so What he had lost he might too lately know, Cursing himself to think what he has done: For I was ever an obedient Son. With pleasure all his glories saw when young, Look't and with pride consid'ring whence I sprung. Joyfully under him and free I playd Baskt in his shine and wanton'd in his shade— But now— Cancelling all what e're he then conferr'd He thrusts me out among the common Herd. Nor quietly will there permit my stay But drives and hunts me like a Beast of prey, Affliction! Oh affliction! 'tis too great, Nor have I ever learnt to suffer yet. Though ruine at me from each side take aim, And I stand thus encompas'd round with flame: Tho' the devouring fire approaches fast, Yet; will I try to plunge: if power wast, I can at worst but sink and burn at last. (Ex. D. Carlos. D. John. Go on! persue thy fortune while 'tis hot, I long for work where Honour's to be got. But, Madam, to this Prince, you're wond'rous kind. Ebol. You are not less to Henriet. I find. D. John. Why, she's a Beauty, tender, young, and fair. Ebol. I thought I might in charms have equall'd her. You told me once my Beauty was not less, Is this your faith? are these your promises? D. John. You would seem jealous, but are crafty grown. Tax me of falshood to conceal your own. Go, Y'are a woman— Ebol. Yes: I know I am. And by my weakness do deserve that name. When heart and Honour I to you resign'd. Would I were not a woman or less kind! D. John. Think you your falshood was not plainly seen, When to your Charge my Brother gave the Queen. Too well I saw it: how did you dispence, In looks your pity to th' afflicted Prince. Whilst I my duty paid the King: your time You watcht, and fixt your melting eyes on him, Admir'd him— Ebol. Yes Sir, for his constancie— But 'twas with pain to think you false to me, When to anothers eyes you homage paid, And my true love wrong'd and neglected laid. Wrong'd too so far as nothing can restore. D. John. Nay, then let's part and think of love no more. Farewel— [D. J. is going. Ebol. Farewel, if y'are resolv'd to go. Inhumane Austria can you leave me so? Enough my Soul is by your falshood rack't. Add not to your inconstancie neglect. Methinks you so far might have grateful prov'd, Not to have quite forgotten that I lov'd. D. John. If e're you lov'd, 'tis you not I forget. For a Remove 'tis here too deeply set. Firm rooted and for ever must remain. [Ebol. turns away. Why thus unkind?— Ebol. Why are you jealous then? [turns to him. D. John. Come, let it be no more! I'm husht and still! Will you forgive? Ebol. How can you doubt my will! I do: D. John. Then send me not away unblest. Ebol. Till your return I will not think of rest. Carlos will hither suddenly repair. The next Apartment's mine; I'le wait you there. Farewel. [Ebol. seems to weep. D. John. O do not let me see a Tear. It quenches Joy and stifles appetite. Like Wars fierce God upon my bliss I'd prey; Who from the furious Toils of Arms all day: Returning home to Loves fair Queen at night, Comes riotous and hot with full delight— [Ex. D. John. Ebol. H'has reapt his Joys, and now he would be free, And to effect it puts on Jealousie. But I'm as much a Libertine as He. As fierce my will as furious my desires, Yet will I hold him; Tho' enjoyment tyres, Though Love and Appetite be at the best; He'll serve as common meats fill up a Feast; And look like plenty though we never taste. Enter Rui-Gomez. Old Lord! I bring thee News will make thee young. R. Gom. Speak, there was always Musique in thy Tongue. Ebol. Thy Foes are tott'ring, and the Day's thy own, Give 'em but one lift now and they go down. Quickly to th' King and all his Doubts renew, Appear disturb'd as if you something knew, Too difficult, and dang'rous to relate. Then bring him hither labouring with the weight, I will take care that Carlos shall be here, So for his jealous eyes a sight prepare: Shall prove more fatal than Medusa's head, And he more Monster seem than she e're made. Enter King attended. King. Still how this Tyrant Doubt torments my Breast! When shall I get th'Usurper dispossest? My thoughts like Birds when frighted from their rest, Around the place where all was husht before, Flutter and hardly settle any more— Ha! Gomez! What art thou thus musing on? [Sees Gomez. R. Gom. I'm thinking what it is to have a Son. What mighty cares and what tempestuous strife Attend on an unhappy Fathers life? How Children Blessings seem, but Torments are, When young our folly, and when old our fear. King. Why dost thou bring these odd reflections here? Thou enviest sure the quiet which I bear. R. Gom. No Sir: I joy i'th' ease which you possess. And wish you never may have cause for less. King. Have cause for less! come nearer, Thou art sad, And look'st as thou wouldst tell me that I had: Now, now, I feel it rising up again— Speak quickly, where is Carlos, where the Queen? What not a word? have my wrongs struck thee dumb? Or art thou swoln and labouring with my doom? Yet dar'st not let the fatal secret come? R. Gom. Heav'n great infirmities to age allots: I'm old and have a thousand doting Thoughts: Seek not to know 'em Sir. King. By Heaven I must. R. Gom. Nay, I would not be by compulsion just. King. Yet; if without it you refuse, you shall. R. Gom. Grant me then one request, I'le tell you all. King. Name thy Petition, and conclude it done. R. Gom. It is that you wou'd here forgive your Son, For all his past offences to this hour. King. Th' hast almost ask'd a thing beyond my pow'r, But so much goodness i'th' request I find, Spite of my self I'le for thy sake be kind; His Pardon's seal'd: The secret now declare. R. Gom. Alas! 'tis only that I saw him here.— King. Where with the Queen? Yes, yes, 'tis so I'm sure. Never were wrongs so great as I endure. So great, that they are grown beyond Complaint, For half my patience might have made a Saint. O Woman! Monstrous Woman! Did I for this into my breast receive, The promising repenting Fugitive? But Gomez, I will throw her back agen, And thou shalt see me smile, and tear her then: I'le crush her heart, where all the poyson lies: Till when the Venom's out, the Viper dies. R. Gom. They the best method of revenge pursue, Who so contrive that it may Justice shew: Stay till their wrongs appear at such a head, That Innocence may have no room to plead. Your fury, Sir, at least a while delay, I guess the Prince may come agen this way: Here I'le withdraw and watch his privacy. King. Aud when he's fixt, be sure bring word to me. Till then, I'le bridle vengeance, and retire, Within my breast suppress this angry fire: Till to my eyes my wrongs themselves display, Then like a Faulcon, gently cut my way; And with my pounces seize th'unwary prey. Ex. King. Enter Eboli. Ebol. I've overheard the business with delight, And find revenge will have a Feast to night. Though thy declining years are in their wane, I can perceive there's youth still in thy brain. Away. The Queen is coming hither. [Ex. R. Gom. Enter Queen, and Women. Henrietta. Queen. Now To all felicity a long adieu! Where are you Eboli? Ebol. Madam, I'm here. Qu. Oh how fresh fears assault me every where! I hear that Carlos is a prisoner made. Ebol. No, Madam, he the Orders disobey'd; And boldly owns for Flanders he intends, To head the Rebels, whom he stiles his friends. But e're he goes, by me does humbly sue, That he may take his last farewel of you. Queen. Will he then force his Destiny at last? Hence quickly to him, Eboli, make haste: Tell him, I beg his purpose he'd delay: Or if that can't his resolution stay, Say I have sworn not to survive the hour, In which I hear that he has left this shore. Tell him, I've gain'd his pardon of the King. Tell him—to stay him—tell him any thing.— Ebol. One word from you his Duty would restore, And though you promis'd ne're to see him more, Methinks you might upon so jnst a score. But see he's here— Enter Don Carlos. D. Carl. Run out of breath by Fate, And persecuted by a Fathers hate, Weari'd with all, I panting hither fly, To lay my self down at your feet and dy. Kneels and kisses her hands. Qu. Oh too unhappy Carlos! yet unkind! 'Gainst you what harms have ever I design'd, That you should with such violence decree; Ungratefully at last to murder me? D. Carl. Pour all thy Curses, Heav'n! upon this head. For I've the worst of vengeance merited; That yet I impudently live to hear, My self upbraided of a wrong to her. [he rises. Say, has your Honour been by me betrai'd? Or have I snares t'entrap your virtue laid? Tell me: if not, why do you then upbraid? Queen. You will not know the afflictions which you give, Was't not my last request that you wou'd live? I by our Vows conjur'd it; but I see, Forgetting them; unmindful too of me; Regardless your own ruine you designe; Though you are sure to purchase it with mine. D. Carl. I as you bad me live, obey'd with pride. Though it was harder far than to have di'd. But loss of Liberty my life disdains. These Limbs were never made to suffer Chains. My Father should have singl'd out some Crown, And bidden me go conquer't for my own: He should have seen what Carlos would have done. But to proscribe my freedom, sinck me low, To base confinement where no comforts flow: But black Despair that foul Tormentor lies: With all my present load of Miseries, Was to my Soul too violent a smart, And rous'd the sleeping Lion in my heart. Queen. Yet then be kind; your angry Father's rage, I know the least submission will asswage. You're hot with Youth, He's cholerick with Age. To him: and put a true obedience on; Be humble, and express your self a Son. Carlos! I beg it of you: Will you not? D. Carl. Methinks 'tis very hard; but yet I'le do't. I must obey whatever you prefer; Knowing y'are all Divine, and cannot err. For if my Doom's unalt'rable, I shall This way at least with less Dishonour fall. And Princes less my tameness thus condemn, When I for you shall suffer, though by him. Queen. In my Apartment farther we'll debate Of this; and for a happy issue wait. Your presence there he cannot disapprove, When it shall speak your Duty and my Love. Ex. Carl. and Queen. Enter R. Gomez. Ebol. Now Gomez triumph. All is ripe. The Toyl Has caught 'em, and Fate saw it with a smile. Thus far the Work of Destiny was mine; But I'm content the Master-piece be thine. Away to th' King; prepare his Soul for Blood; A Mystery thou well hast understood: Whilst I go rest within a Lovers arms, And to my Austria lay out all my charms. [aside. Exit. R. Gom. Fate open now thy Book, and set 'em down, I have already markt 'em for thy own. Enter King, and Posa (at a distance.) My Lord the King. King. Gomez! R. Gom. The same. King. Hast seen The Prince? R. Gom. I have. King. Where is he? R. Gom. With the Queen. King. Now ye that dwell in everlasting flame, And keep Records of all ye mean to damn, Shew me, if 'mongst your Presidents there e're Was seen a Son like him, or wife like her! Hark Gomez! did'st not hear th'Infernals groan? Hush Hell a little, and they are thy own. Posa. Who should these be? the King and Gomez sure: at a distance. Methinks, I wish that Carlos were secure. For Flanders his Dispatches I've prepar'd. King. Who's there? 'Tis Posa Pander to their Lust. drawing near to Posa. Now Gomez to his heart thy Dagger Thrust; In the pursuit of vengeance drive it far, Strike deep, and if thou can'st wound Carlos there. R. Gom. I'le do't as close as happy Lovers kiss; May he strike mine if of his heart I miss. Thus Sir— [Stabs him. Posa. Ha Gomez! Villain! thou hast done Thy worst! but yet I would not die alone: Here Dogg— [Stabs at him. R. Gom. So brisk! then take it once again, As they are struggling the Dispatches fall out of Posa's bosom. 'Twas onely Sir to put you out of pain. [Stabs him again, and Posa falls. Posa. My Lord! the King! but life too far is gone, I faint! be mindful of your Queen and Son. [Dies. King. The Slave in death repents and warnes me, Yes I shall be very mindful: What are These? Takes up the Dispatches. For Flanders! with the Prince's Signet seal'd? Here's Villany has yet been unreveal'd. See Gomez! practices against my Crown: [Shows e'm him. Treason and Lust have Joyn'd to pull me down. Yet still I stand like a firm sturdy Rock, Whilst they but split themselves with their own shock. But I too long delay, give word I come. R. Gom. What hoa! within: the King is nigh, make room. The SCENE drawes, and discovers D. John, and Eboli embraacing. King. Now let me if I can to fury add, That when I thunder, I may strike e'm dead. [Looking earnestly on e'm. Ha!—Gomez! on this Truth depends thy Life, Why that's our Brother Austria! R. G. And my Wife! Embracing close; Whilst I was busie grown In others ruines, here I've met my own. Oh! had I perish't e're 'twas understood. King. This is the Nest, where Lust and falshood brood. Is it not admirable?— Exit D. John and Eboli embracing. R. Gom. O Sir yes! Ten thousand Devils tear the Sorceress— King. But they are gone, and my Dishonour's near. Enter D. Carlos and Queen discoursing. Look my incestuous Son and Wife appear! See Gomez, how she Languishes and dyes, 'S'death! There are very pulses in her eyes. [D. Carlos approaches the King. D. Carl. In peace, Heav'h ever guard the King from harms, In Warr Success and Triumph crown his Arms: Till all the Nations of the World shall be Humbled and prostrate at his feet like me. [Kneels. I hear your fury has my Death design'd; Though I've deserv'd the worst, you may be kind: Behold me as your poor unhappy Son, And do not spill that blood which is your own. King. Yes! when my blood growes tainted I ne'r doubt But for my health, 'tis good to let it out: But thine's a stranger like thy soul to me, Or else be curs't thy Mothers memory: And doubly curst be that unhappy night, In which I purchac'd torment with delight. D. Carl. Thus then I lay aside all rights of blood, Rises boldly. My Mother curst! she was all Just and good. Tyrant! too good to stay with thee below, And therefore's blest, and raigns above thee now. Submission, which way got it entrance here! King. Perhaps it came e're Treason was aware, Thy trayterous designs now come to Light, Too great, and horrid to be hid in night: See here my Honour and thy Duties stains; Shews the Dispatches. I've paid your Secretary for his pains. He waits you there, to Council with him, go Ask what Intelligence from Flanders now. Shows Posa's Body. D. Carl. My Friend here slain, my faithful Posa, 'tis; Good Heav'n! what have I done to merit this? What Temples sack't? what Desolations made, To pull down such a vengeance on my head? This Villain, was thy work; what Friend of thine [To Gomez. Did I e're wrong, that thou should'st murder mine? But I'le take care it shall not want reward— [Drawes. King. Courage, my Gomez! since thy King's thy Guard. Come Rebel, and thy Villanies fulfill. D. Carl. No: Tho' unjust, you are my Father still. Throwes away his Sword. And from that Title must your safety own: 'Tis that which awes my hand, and not your Crown. 'Tis true all there contain'd I had design'd; To such a height your Jealousie was grown, It was the onely way that I could find To work your peace, and to procure my own. King. Thinking my Youth and Vigour to decrease, You'd ease me of my Crown to give me peace. D. Carl. Alas! you fetch your misconstructions far, The injuries to Me, and wrongs to her, Were much too great for Empire to repair: When you forgot a Father's Love, and quite Depriv'd me of a Sons and Princes right: Branded my Honour, and pursu'd my Life, My Duty Long with Nature was at strife: Not that I fear'd my Memory or Name, Could suffer by the voice of common Fame. A thing I still esteem'd beneath my pride; For though condemn'd by all the world beside, Had you but thought me just, I could have dy'd. At last this onely way I found, to flye Your anger, and divert you Jealousie— To go for Flanders, and be so remov'd From all, I ever honour'd, ever Lov'd. There in your right hoping I might compleat, 'Spight of my wrongs some Action truly great. Thus by my Faith and Sufferings to out-wear Your hate, and shun that storm which threaten'd here. Queen. And can this merit hate! he would forgo The joyes and charms of Courts to purchase you: Banish himself, and stem the dang'rous Tide Of Lawless outrage, and rebellious pride. King. How evenly she pleads in his defence! So blind is guilt when 'twou'd seem Innocence. She thinks her softness may my rage Disarm; No, Sorceress! Y'are mistaken in your charm. And whilst you sooth, do but assist the storm. Do, take full view of your tall able slave, Q. loking on Carlos. Look hard; it is the last y'are like to have. D. Carl. My Life or Death are in your pow'r to give. King. Yes, and thou dy'st! D. Carl. Not till she give me leave; She is the Star that rules my Destiny. And whilst her Aspect's kind, I cannot dy. Qu. No Prince, for ever live, be ever blest. King. Yes, I will send him to's eternal rest! Oh! had I took the Journey long ago, I n'ere had known the pains that rack me now. Queen. What pains? what racks? [approaching him. King. Avoid and touch me not. I see thee foul all one incestuous blot: Thy broken Vows are in thy guilty face. Queen. Have I then in your pity left no place? King. Oh thus it was you drew me in before, With promises you ne'r would see him more. But now your subtlest Wiles too weak are grown, I've gotten freedome and I'le keep't my own. Queen. May you be ever free, but can your Mind Conceive that any ill was here design'd? He hither came onely that he might show Obedience, and be reconcil'd to you. You saw his humble Dutiful address. King. But you before-hand sign'd the happy Peace. Enter Eboli. Oh Princess thank you for the Care you take! Tell me! how got this Monster entrance? speak. Ebol. Heav'n witness, 'twas without my knowledg done. R. Gom. No, she had other bus'ness of her own. [aside. Oh Blood and Murder— King. All are false! A Guard. [Enter Guard. Seize on that Traytor.— [To Carlos. D. Carl. Welcome: I am prepar'd. Queen. Stay Sir! let me die too, I can obey. King. No, Thou shalt live. [Seemingly kind. By heav'n but not a Day; I a revenge so exquisite have fram'd, [aside. She unrepenting dies, and so she's damn'd. Henr. If ever pity could your heart ingage, If e're you hope for blessings on your Age, Incline your ears to a poor Virgins pray'r. King. I dare not venture thee, thou art too fair. What would'st thou say? Henr. Destroy not in one man More Virtue than the World can boast agen. View him the eldest pledge of your first Love, Your Virgin Joyes! that may some pity move— King. No: for the wrongs I suffer weigh it down, I'd now not spare his life to save my own. Away by thy soft Tongue, I'le not be caught. Henr. By all that hopes can frame I begg; if not, May you by some base hand unpity'd dye; And childless Mothers curse your Memory. By Honour; Love; by Life!— King. Fond Girle away. By heav'n I'le kill thee else! still dar'st thou stay? Cannot Death terrifie Thee? Henr. —No, for I, If you refuse me, am resolv'd to die. D. Carl. Kind fair one do not wast your sorrows here On me, too wretched, and not worth a tear. There yet for you are mighty Joyes in store When I in dust am laid, and seen no more. Oh Madam!— [To the Queen. Qu. Oh my Carlos! must you dye For me? no mercy in a Father's eye. D. Carl. Hide, Hide your Tears, into my Soul they dart A tenderness that misbecomes my heart: For since I must, I like a Prince would fall, And to my aid my Manly spirits call. Qu. You like a man as roughly as you will May die, but let me be a woman still. [Weeps. King. Th'art Woman, a true Copy of the first, In whom the race of all Mankind was curst. Your Sex by Beauty was to Heav'n ally'd; But your great Lord the Devil taught you pride. He too an Angel till he durst rebel; And you are sure the Stars that with him fell. Weep on, a stock of tears like Vows you have, And alwaies ready when you wou'd deceive. Qu. Cruel Inhumane! Oh my heart! why shou'd I throw away a Title that's so good, On one a stranger to what e're was so: Alas I'm torn, and know not what to do. The Just resentment of my wrong's so great, Ready to sink with passion. My spirits sink beneath the heavy weight. Tyrant! stand off. I hate thee! and will try If I have scorn enough to make me dye. D. Car. Blest Angel stay— [Takes her in his Arms. Qu. Carlos! the sole Embrace You ever took, you have before his face. D. Carl. No wealthy Monarch of the plenteous East, In all the Glories of his Empire drest, Was ever half so rich, or half so blest! But from such bliss how wretched is the fall; They too like we must die, and leave it all. King. All this before my face! what Soul could bear't. Go force her from him. [Officer approaches. D. Car. —Slave 'twill cost thy heart: Th'adst better meet a Lyon on his way, And from his hungry Jawes reprize the prey: She's Mistriss of my Soul, and to prepare My self for death, I must consult with her. R. Go. Have pity— [Ironically. King. Hence! How wretchedly he rules, That's serv'd by Cowards, and advis'd by fooles. Oh Torture!— D. Car. —Rouze my Soul, Consider now, That to thy blissful Mansion thou must go. But I so mighty Joyes have tasted here, I hardly shall have sence of any there. Oh soft as Blossoms! and yet sweeter far: Leaning on her bosom. Sweeter than Incense which to Heav'n ascends, Though 'tis presented there by Angels hands. King. Still in his Arms! Cowards go tear her forth. D. Car. You'l sooner from its Center shake the Earth. I'l hold her fast till my last hour is nigh; Then I'l bequeath her to you when I die. King. Cut off his hold or any thing.— D. Carl. —Ay Come. Here kill, and bear me hence into my Tomb: I'd have my Monument erected Here, With broken mangled Limbs still clasping her. Qu. Hold and I'l quit his Arms— [The Gu. Offer their Axes. King. Now bear him hence. [They part. Qu. Oh horrid Tyrant! The Gu. are hurrying Carlos off. Stay Unhappy Prince— Turn, turn oh Torment! must I leave you so? No stay and take me with you where you go. D. Carl. Hark slaves, my Goddess summons me to stay. Dogs! have you eyes, and can you disobey? Pressing forward. See her! Oh let me but just touch my bliss. King. By Hell he shan't, slaves are ye mine or his. Qu. My life! D. Car. —My Soul Farewel— Qu. —He's gone, he's gone. [Exit Carlos. Now Tyrant to thy rage I'm left alone. Give me my death that hate both life and thee. King. I know thou dost, yet live. Qu. —Oh misery! Why was I born to be thus curst? or why Throwes her self on the floor. Should life be forc't, when 'tis so sweet to die? King. Thou woman hast been false: but to renew [To Eboli. Thy Credit in my heart, assist me now: Prepare a draught of poison, such as will Act slow, and by degrees of Torment kill. Give it the Queen, and to prevent all sence Of dying, tell her I've releas'd the Prince, And that e're Morning he'l attend her: I In a disguise his presence will supply: So Glut my rage, and smiling see her dye. Ebol. Your Majesty shall be obey'd—. R. Go. Do, work thy mischiefs to their last degree, And when th'are in their height I'l murder thee. [aside. King. Now Gomez ply my rage and keep it hot; O're Love and Nature I've the Conquest got: Still charming Beauty triumphs in her eyes, Looking at the Queen. Yet for my honour, and my rest she dies. [Exeunt Queen and Women. But oh what Ease can I expect to get, When I must purchase at so dear a rate. [Exeunt Omnes. The SCENE shuts. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Fifth. SCENE the First. Enter King Solus. King. 'Tis night: the season when the happy take Repose, and only wretches are awake: Now discontented Ghosts begin their rounds, Haunt ruin'd Buildings and unwholsome Grounds: Or at the Curtains of the restless wait, To frighten 'em with some sad sale of fate. When I would rest, I can no rest obtain; The ills I've born ev'n o're my slumbers reign, And in sad Dreams torment me o're again. The fatal bus'ness is e're this begun: I'm shock't, and start to think what I have done. But I forget how I that Phillip am So much for Constancy renown'd by fame: Who through the Progress of my life, was ne're By hopes transported, or depress'd by fear. No, it is gone too far to be recall'd, And stedfastness will make the Act extoll'd. Enter Eboli in a Night-Gown. Who! Eboli? Ebol. My Lord. King. Is the Deed done? Ebol. 'Tis! and the Queen to seek repose is gone. King. Can she expect it? who allow'd me none! No Eboli; her Dreams must be as full Of horrour, and as Hellish as her Soul; Does she believe the Prince has freedome gaind? Ebol. She does. King. How were the tydings entertain'd? Ebol. O're all her Face young wandring blushes were, Such as speak hopes too weak to conquer fear.— But when confirm'd no Lover e're so kind, She clasp'd me fast, caress't, and call'd me Friend: Which Opportunity I took to give The Poison; and till Day she cannot live. King. Quickly then to her: say that Carlos here Waits to confirm his happiness with her. Go: that my vengeance I may finish quite, 'Twould be imperfect should I lose the sight. But to contrive that I may not be known, And she may still mistake me for my Son: Remove all Lights but that which may suffice To let her see me scorn her when she dies. Ebol. You'l find her all in ruful sables clad, With one dim Lamp that yields imperfect light, Such as in Vaults assist the ghastly shade, Where wretched Widows come to weep at Night: Thus she resolves to die, or living mourn, Till Carlos shall with Liberty return. King. Oh stedfast Sin! incorrigible Lust! Not damn'd! it is impossible she must. How do I long to see her in her pains, The poys'nous Sulphur rowling through her Veins. Enter D. John, and Attendants. Who's there? my Brother! D. John. Yes Sir, and your Friend! What can your Presence here so late intend? King. Oh Austria! Fate's at work; a Deed's in hand Will put thy Youthful Courage to a stand. Survey me: Do I look as heretofore? D. John. You look like King of Spain, and Lord of Pow'r: Like one who still seeks Glory on the Wing; You look as I would do, were I a King. King. A King! why I am more, I'm all that can Be counted miserable in a man: But thou shalt see how calm anon I'le grow, I'le be as happy and as gay as Thou. D. John. No Sir! my happiness you cannot have! Whilst to your abject passions thus a slave. To know my ease you thoughts like mine must bring, Be something less a man, and more a King. King. I'm growing so: 'Tis true that long I strove With pleading Nature, combated with Love. Those Witchcrafts that had bound my Soul so fast, But now the Date of the Enchantment'ts past: Before my rage like ruines down they fall, And I mount up true Monarch o're e'm all. D. John. I know your Queen and Son y'have doom'd to die, And fear by this the fatal hour is nigh. Why would you cut a sure Succession off, At which your Friends must grieve, and Foes will laugh. As if since Age has from you took away Increase, you'd grow malicious and destroy. King. Doubt it not Austria: Thou my Brother art, And in my blood I'm certain hast a part. Onely the Justice of my Vengeance own, Th'art Heir of Spain, and my adopted Son. D. John. I must confess there in a Crown are charms, Which I would Court in bloody Fields and Arms; But in my Nephew's wrong I must decline, Since he must be extinguish't e're I shine. To mount a Throne o're Battlements I'd climb, Where Death should wait on Me, not I on him. Did you e're Love, or have you ever known The mighty Value of so brave a Son? King. I guess'd I should be treated thus before; I know it is thy Kindness, but no more: Thou living free, alas, art easie grown, And think'st all hearts as honest as thy own. D. John. Not Sir so easie! as I must be bold, And speak what you perhaps wou'd have untold; That y'are a slave to th'vilest that obey, Such as Disgrace on Royal Favour lay: And blindly follow as they lead astray. Voracious Varlets, sordid Hangers on, Best by familiarity Th'are known, Yet shrink at frowns, but when you smile they fawn. Th'are these have wrong'd you and abus'd your Ears, Possest your Mind with false mis-grounded fears. King. Mis-grounded fears! why is there any Truth In Womens Vowes, or Disobedient Youth! I sooner would believe this World were Heav'n; Where I have nought but Toyles and Torment met, And never comfort yet to man was given: But thou shalt see how my revenge I'le treat. The SCENE drawes and discovers the Queen (alone) in mourning on her Couch with a Lamp by her. Look where she sits as quiet and serene, [Ironically. As if she never had a Thought of sin. In mourning her wrong'd Innocence to show; Sh'has sworn't so oft that she believes it true. O'rewhelm'd with sorrow she'l in darkness dwell, So we have heard of Witches in a Cell, Treating with Fiends and making Leagues with Hell. [Q. rises, and comes towards him. Queen. My Lord! Prince Carlos? may it be believ'd! Are my eyes blest? and am I not deceiv'd? King. My Queen! My Love I'm here— [Embraces her. Queen. My Lord! the King! This is surprizing Kindness, which you bring! Can you believe me Innocent at last? Methinks my griefs are half already past! King. O Tongue in nothing practis'd, but deceit; Too well she knew him not to find the cheat: Yes vile Incestuous Woman! it is I The King! Look on me well, despair and die. Queen. Why had you not pronounc'd my doom before, Since to affliction you could add no more: Methinks Death is less welcome when I find, You could but Counterfeit a look that's kind. King. No, now th'art fit for Death, had I believ'd Thou could'st have been more wicked, thou had'st liv'd. Liv'd and gone on in lust and riot still, But I perceiv'd thee early ripe for Hell: And that of the reward thou might'st not miss, This night th'ast drank thy bane, th'art poison'd: Yes Thou art— Queen. —Then welcome everlasting bliss. But e're I die, let me here make a Vow. By Heav'n, and all I hope for there I'm true. King. Vows you had alwaies ready when you spoke, How many of 'em have you made and broke? Yet there's a pow'r that does your falshood hear, A Just one too, and lets thee live to swear. How comes it that above such mercy dwels, To permit Sin, and make us Infidels? Queen. You have been ever so to all that's good, My Innocence had else been understood. At first your love was nothing but your pride; When I arriv'd to be the Prince's Bride, You then a Kind Indulgent Father were: But finding me Unfortunately fair, Thought me a prize too rich to be possest By him, and forc't your self into my breast; Where you maintain'd an Unresisted pow'r: Not your own Daughter could have lov'd you more: Till Conscious of your Age my faith was blam'd, And I a lewd Adulteress proclaim'd; Accus'd of foulest Incest with your Son: What more could my worst Enemy have done? King. Nothing I hope, I would not have it said, That in my Vengeance any fault I made. Love me! oh low pretence! too feebly built: But 'tis the Constant fault of dying guilt, Ev'n to the last to cry th'are Innocent; When their despair's so great, they can't repent. Queen. Thus having Urg'd your Malice to the head, You spightfully are Come to rail me dead. Had I been man and had an impious Wife, With speedy fury I'd have snatch'd her life: Torn a broad passage open to her heart, And there have ransack't each polluted part: Triumph'd and laugh'd t'have seen the Iss'uing flood, And Wantonly have bath'd my hands in blood. That had out-done the low revenge You bring, Much fitter for a Woman then a King. King. I'm glad I know what death you'd wish to have, You would go down in silence to your grave: Remove from future fame, as present times, And bury with you if you could your Crimes. No, I will have my Justice understood: Proclaim thy falshood, and thy lust aloud, Queen. About it then, the noble work begin, Be proud and boast how cruel you have been. Oh how a Monarch's glory 'twill advance! Do, quickly let it reach the ears of France; I've there a Royal Brother that is Young, Who'l certainly revenge his Sisters Wrong: Into thy Spain a mighty Army bring, Tumble thee from thy Throne, a wretched thing, And make it quite forgot thou e're wert King. King. I ne're had pleasure with her till this Night: The Viper finds she's crush't, and fain would bite. Oh were he here and durst maintain that word, I'd like an Eagle seize the Callow Bird, And gripe him till the dastard Craven Cry'd; Then throw him panting by his Sisters side. Qu. Alas! I faint and sink, my Lord your hand, [To D. J. My spirits fail, and I want strength to stand. D. J. O Jealousie. A Curse which none but he that bears it knows; Leads her to a Chair. So rich a Treasure who would live to loose. King. The poison works, heav'n grant there were enough: She is so foul, she may be poison proof. Now, my false fair one— Qu. Tyrant hence be gone, This hour's my last, and let it be my own. Away, away, I would not leave the light, With such a hated Object in my sight. King. No, I will stay and ev'n thy prayr's prevent, I would not give thee leisure to repent: But let thy sins all in one Throng Combine To plague thy Soul, as thou hast Tortur'd mine. Qu. Glut then your Eyes, your Tyrant Fury feed, And Triumph; but remember when I'm dead, Hereafter on your dying pillows, you May feel those Tortures, which you give me now. Go on, your worst reproaches I can bear, And with 'em all, you shall not force a Tear. King. Thus Austria my lost freedom I obtain, And once more shall appear my self again. Love held me fast whilst like a foolish Boy I of the thing was fond because 'twas gay, But now I've thrown the gaudy Toy away. Eboli within. Eb. Help, Murder, help.— King. —See Austria whence that Cry, Call up our Guards, there may be danger nigh. [Enter Guard. Enter Eboli in her night-dress wounded and bleeding, Rui-Gomez pursuing her. Eb. Oh Guard me from that Cruel Murderer! But 'tis in vain, the steel has gone too far: Turn Wretched King, I've something to unfold, Nor can I die till the sad Secret's Told. King. The Woman's mad! to some Apartment by Remove her, where she may grow tame and dye. Fate came abroad to night resolv'd to range; I Love a kind Companion in revenge. [huggs R. Go. Ebol. If in your heart truth any favour wins; If e're you would repent of secret sins, Here me a word. King. —What would'st thou say? be brief. Ebol. Do what you can to save that pretious life: Try every art that may her death prevent; You are abus'd, and she is innocent. When I perceiv'd my hopes of you were vain, Led by my lust I practis'd all my Charms, To gain the Prince Don Carlos to my Arms: But there too cross't, I did the purpose change, And pride made him my Engine for Revenge: [To R. Go. Taught him to raise your growing Jealousie, To D. J. Then my wild passion at this Prince did fly, And that was done for which I now must die. King. Ha Gomez, speak and Quickly, is it so? R. Go. I'm sorry you should doubt if't be or no: She by whose lust my honour was betray'd, Cannot want malice now to take my head, And therefore does this penitence pretend. Eb. Oh Austria take away that Ugly Fiend, He smiles and mocks me, waiting for my Soul: See how his glaring fiery Eye-balls rowl. R. Go. Thus is her fancy tortur'd by her guilt; But since you'l have my blood, let it be spilt. King. No more— [To R. Go. Speak on I charge thee by the rest [To Eb. Thou hope'st the truth, and as thou shalt be blest. Eb. As what I've said is so: There may I find, where I must answer all, What most I need, heav'ns mercy on my Soul. [Dyes. King. Heav'n! she was sensible that she should dye, And durst not in the minute tell a lye. D. J. His guilt's too plain, see his wild staring Eye. By unconcern he would show innocence, But Harden'd Guilt ne're wanted the pretence Of great submission when't had no defence. Thus whilst of life you shew this little Care, You seem not guiltless, but betray despair. King. His life! what satisfaction can that give? But oh in doubt I must for ever live, And loose my peace—Yet I the truth will find: I'l rack him for't; go in this minute bind Him to the wheel— R. Go. How have I this deserv'd, Who only your Commands obey'd and serv'd? What would you have me do? King. —I'd have thee tell The truth; do Gomez, all shall then be well. R. Go. Alas! like you Sir, in a Cloud I'm lost, And can but tell you what I think at most: You set me as a Spy upon the Prince, And I still brought the best Intelligence I could, till finding him too much aware Of me, I nearer measures took by her: Which if I after a false Copy drew, 'Tis I have been Unfortunate as you. King. And this is all thou hast for life to shew? R. Go. Dear Sir your pardon, it is all I know. King. Then Villain I am damn'd as well as thou. Heav'n where is now thy sleeping providence, That took so little care of Innocence? Oh Austria, had I to thy truth inclind: Hid I been half so good as thou wer't kind. But I'm too tame, secure that Traytor; Oh Guards seizes him. Earth open to thy Center, let me Go And there for ever hide my Impious head. Thou fairest purest Creature Heav'n e're made, Thy Injur'd truth too late I've understood: Yet live and be Immortal as Th'art good. Queen. Can you to think me Innocent incline On her bare word, and would not Credit mine: The poison's very busie at my heart, Methinks I see Death shake his Threat'ning dart: Why are you kind and make it hard to die? Persist, Continue on the Injury. Call me still vile, incestuous, all that's foul. King. Oh pity, pity my despairing Soul; Sink it not quite. Raise my Physitians strait; Hasten 'em quickly e're it be too late. Propose rewards may set their skill at strife, I'l give my Crown to him that saves her life. Curst Dog!— [To Gomez. D. J. Vile prostitute! King. —Revengeful Fiend! But Iv'e forgotten half, to Carlos send; Prevent what his despair may make him do: Enter Henrietta. Henr. Oh Horror, Horror, everlasting Woe. The Prince, the Prince! King. Hah! speak.— Hen. —He dyes, he dyes. Within upon his Couch he bleeding lyes: Just taken from a Bath, his Veins all Cut, From which the springing blood flowes swiftly out. He threatens death on all that shall oppose His fate, to save that life which he will loose. King. Dear Austria hasten, all thy int'rest use. Tell him it is to Friendship an Offence, And let him know his Father's penitence: Beg him to live.— R. Go. Since yo've decreed my death, know 'twill be hard, The Bath by me was poison'd when prepar'd. I Ow'd him that for his late pride and scorn: King. There never was so curs't a Villain born. But by revenge such pains he shall go through, As ev'n Religious Cruelty ne're knew. Rack him! I'l broyl him, burn him by degrees; Fresh Torments for him ev'ry hour devise, Till he Curse heav'n, and then the Caitiff dies. Queen. My faithful Henrietta art thou come To wait th'unhappy Mistress to her Tomb? I brought thee hither from thy Parents young, And now must leave thee, to heav'n knowes what wrong. But Heav'n to its protection will receive Such goodness, let it then thy Queen forgive. Hen. How much I lov'd you, Madam, none can tell; For 'tis Unspeakable, I lov'd so well. A proof of it the World shall quickly find: For when You dye, I'l scorn to stay behind. Enter D. Carlos supported between two, and bleeding. D. John. See Sir, your Son. King. My Son! but oh how dare I use that name when this sad Object's near. See Injur'd Prince who 'tis thy pardon Craves; No more thy Father, but the worst of slaves: Behold the tears that from these fountains flow. D. Carl. I come to take my farewel, e're I go To that bright dwelling, where there is no room For Blood, and where the Cruel never Come. King. I know there is not; therefore must despair: Oh heav'n his Cruelty I cannot bear. Dost thou not hear thy wretched Father sue? D. Car. My Father, speak the word once more, is't you? And may I think the dear Conversion true? Oh that I could! King. By heav'n thou must—it is. Let me Embrace and kiss thy Trembling knees. Why wilt thou dye? no, live my Carlos live, And all the wrongs that I have done, forgive. D. Car. Life was my Curse, and giv'n me sure in spight: Oh had I perisht when I first saw light, I never then these miseries had brought On you, nor by you had been Guilty thought. Prop me: apace I feel my life decay. The little time on Earth I have to stay, Grant I without Offence may here bestow: Pointing to the Queen. You cannot certainly be Jealous now. King. Break, break my heart— Leads D. Carlos to the Chair. D. Car. Y'ave thus more kindness shown, Then if y'ad Crown'd and plac't me on your Throne. Methinks so highly happy I appear, That I could pity you, to see You there: Take me away again, You are too good. Queen. Carlos is't you? Oh stop that Royal flood; Live, and possess your Father's Throne, when I In dark and gloomy Shades forgotten lie. D. Car. Crowns are beneath me, I have higher pride Thus on you fixt, and dying by your side, How much a Life and Empire I disdain; No, we'l together mount, where both shall raign Above all Wrongs, and never more Complain. Queen. Oh matchless Youth! oh Constancy Divine! Sure there was never Love that Equall'd thine; Nor any so Unfortunate as mine.— Henceforth forsaken Virgins shall in Songs, When they would ease their own, repeat thy wrongs: And in remembrance of thee, for thy sake, A solemn Annual Procession make: In Chast devotion as fair Pilgrims Come, With Hyacinths, and Lillies, deck thy Tomb. But one thing more, and then Vain World adieu! It is to reconcile my Lord, and You. D. Carl. H'as done no wrong to me, I am possest Of all, beyond my expectation blest. But yet methinks there's something in my heart, Tells me I must not too Unkindly part: Father draw nearer, raise me with your hand, Before I dye, what is't you would Command? King. The Grant thoul't find too difficult a Task; I want forgiveness if I durst but ask. How Curst! and yet how might I have been blest! D. Carl. Oh all my wrongs and my misfortunes past, As they ne're were let your Remembrance shun, And quite forget e'm all as I ha' done. Alas! 'tis fate has been too blame, not You, Who only Honours dictates did pursue. I was a wicked Son, Indeed I was; Rebel to Yours as well as Duties Laws. By head-strong will too proud to be confin'd; Scorn'd your Commands, and at your Joyes repin'd. When to my love your Royal Claim was layd, I should have born my Inj'ries and obeyd; But I was hot, and would my right maintain, Which you forgave; yet I rebell'd again, And nought but death can now wash off the stain. King. Why wert thou made so excellently good; And why was it no sooner Understood? But I was Curs't, and blindly led astray; Oh for thy Father, for thy Father pray. Thou may'st ask that which I'm too vile to dare; And leave me not tormented by despair. D. Carl. Thus then with the remains of life we kneel, D. Carl. and the Queen sink out of the Chairs, and kneel. May you be ever free from all that's ill. Queen. And everlasting peace upon you dwell. King. No more; this Virtue's too divinely bright, My Darken'd Soul too Conversant with Night, Grows blind, and Overcome with too much light. Here raise e'm up: Gently ye slaves, down, down, Ye Glorious Toyles a Scepter and a Crown For ever be forgotten, in your stead Only Eternal darkness wrap my head. Qu. Where are you? oh Farewel, I must be gone. King. Blest happy Soul, take not thy flight to soon: Stay till I dye, then bear mine with thee too, And Guard it up, which else must sink below. Qu. From all my Injuries and all my fears; From Jealousie Love's bane; the worst of Cares, Thus I remove to find that stranger rest, Carlos thy hand support me on thy breast, Within this minute how shall we be blest. D. Car. Oh far above What ever wishes fram'd, or hopes design'd; Thus where we go we shall the Angels find, For ever pressing, and for ever kind. Qu. Make hast, in the first Sphear I'l for you stay; Thence we'l rise both to Everlasting day. Farewel— [Dyes. D. Car. I follow you, now Close my eyes; Leans on her bosome. Thus all o're bliss the Happy Carlos dyes. King. Th'are gone, th'are gone, where I must n'ere aspire, Run, sally out, and set the World on fire. Alarum Nature, let loose all the winds; Set free those spirits whom strong Magick binds. Let the Earth open all her Sulph'rous Veins, The Fiends start from their Hell and shake their Chains, Till all things from their Harmony decline, And the Confusion be as great as mine, Here I'l lye down, and never more arise; Howl out my life, and rend the Ayr with Cryes. D. John. Hold Sir! afford your lab'ring heart some ease. King. Oh name it not! there's no such thing as Peace. From these warm Lips, yet one soft kiss I'le take: How my heart beats! why won't the Rebel break? My Love, my Carlos, I'm thy Father, speak. Oh he regards not now my miseries! But deaf to my Complaint, as I have been to his. Oh now I think on't better, all is well; Here's one that's just descending into Hell: How comes it that he's not already gone? The Sluggard's Lazy, but I'le spur him on. Hey! how he flyes. [Stabs R. Gomez. R. Gom. 'Twas aym'd well at my heart That I had strength enough but to retort: Dull Life so tamely must I from thee part! Curses and plagues; Revenge where art thou now? Meet, meet me at thy own dark house below. [Dyes. King. He's gone, and now there's not so vile a thing As I. D. John. Remember Sir, You are a King. King. A King! it is too little; I'le be more I tell thee: Nero was an Emperour, He kill'd his Mother; but I've that out-done, Murder'd a Loyal Wife, and Guiltless Son. Yet Au'stria, why should I grow mad for that? Is it my fault I was unfortunate? D. John. Collect your Spirits Sir, and calm your Mind? King. Look too't! strange things I tell thee are design'd. Thou Austria shal't grow old, and in thy age Doat, Doat, my Heroe! oh a long gray Beard, With Eyes distiling Rheum, and hollow Cheeks, Will be such charms thou can'st not want success: But above all beware of Jealousie. It was the dreadful Curse that ruin'd me. D. John. Dread Sir, no more. King. Oh Heart! Oh Heaven! but stay, Nam'd I not heaven? I did, and at the word (Methought I saw't) the Azure fabrick stir'd. Oh for my Queen and Son the Saints prepare! But I'le pursue and Overtake e'm there. Whirle, stop the Sun, arrest his Charioteer; I'le ride in that away, pull, pull him down: Oh how I'le hurl the Wild-fire as I run. Now, now I mount— [Runs off raving D. John. Look to the King. See of this fair one too strict care be had. Pointing to Henrietta. Despair! how vast a Triumph hast thou made? No more in Loves Enervate charms I'le ly, Shaking off softness, to the Camp I'le fly; Where Thirst of Fame the Active Hero warms, And what I've lost in Peace, regain in Arms. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. Spoken by a Girle. Now what d'ye think my Message hither means? Yonder's the Poet sick behind the Scenes: He told me there was pity in my face, And therefore sent me here to make his peace. Let me for once perswade ye to be kind; For he has promis'd me to stand my Friend. And if this time I can your kindness move, He'l write for me, he swears by all above, When I am bigg enough to be in love. Now won't you be good natur'd, ye fine men? Indeed I'le grow as fast as e're I can, And try if to his promise he'l be true: Think on't, when that time comes; you do not know, But I may grow in love with some of you: Or at the worst I'm certain I shall see Amongst you those who'l swear they're so with me. But now, if by my Suit you'l not be won, You know what your unkindness oft has done; I'le e'n forsake the Play-House, and turn Nun. THE END.</field>
