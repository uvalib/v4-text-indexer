      <field name="fulltext">OptimÃ¦ spei Iuveni Domino Benedicto Roberts, filio natu minori Nicolai Roberts Armigeri, amoris ergÃ², &amp; observantiÃ¦ erga parentes, sequentia poemata humillimÃ¨ dedicat Thomas Nabbes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his intimate and learned friend Master Thomas Nabbes on his ensuing Poems. Let those who to the world oft publish forth Their owne deserts, in praysing others worth, Throng for a roome; and pride themselves to be Ranck'd in the front of thy learn'd poesie. It shall suffice mee (who have never yet Studied to humour others, not have sweat Like some, two houres in plodding jests, which may At the first sight their authour's wits betray) To have a meaner roome: for I nor come To begge the reader mittigate thy doome; Nor with intent to praise thy worke or thee: For that would seeme a plaine Tautologie. Those, whose diviner soules PhÅbean flame Hath throughly kindled, such as have a name I'the list of PhÅbu's darlings, will admire The eager flames of thy poetique fire. None will dislike ought here, but such dull things Whose soules are out of tune; When PhÅbus sings Some bayards will be bold to judge his straine Harsh and unpleasing; yet applaud the vaineâ âConfused sound of some hoarse pipers voyce, And say 'tis rare, and makes an excellent noyse. If that it chance some fancy not thy straine Th'are dull and ignorant; the wiser traine Will praise thee for't, and utter still with fame The often mention of thy honourd name. Let critiques censure, and these lines condemne, Secur d by thine owne bayes, their rage contemne. C. G. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his honoured friend Master Thomas Nabbes. Had I the massie wealth of Cheops, then I'de raise a Piramid unto thy pen That should for State put downe the empty fame Of Mausoleus tombe, blot out the name The Sunnes Colossus had in that same day When it bestrid the spatious Rhodian bay. Let Momus prate; thou art above him farre: The curre that barkes at, cannot hurt the starre. But why should I presume? for mee to praise Thy winged raptures, rhapsodies and layes Were with darke Lanterne up and downe to runne, And shew th'admiring world the glittring Sunne. Robert Chamberlaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within an Arch of agreeable workmanship, a ScÃ¦ne of Winter presents it selfe, the Trees and Earth covered with Snow, and in the middle thereof a prospect of a faire house as the Mansion of Christmasse. Venus and Cupid descend. Venus. Without good meat and drinke must Venus freeze? Must I derive my flames and my desire From Ceres and from Bacchus? shall the fire That burnes in hearts, and payes me solemne rites Kindle from fulnesse and gorg'd appetites? It shall not Sonne. Learne of thy Sea-borne mother Never to borrow power from any other. The vertue that's our owne, who dares to claime? Are not both Gods and men by thy sure ayme, When at their bosomes thou direct'st a Dart, Wounded with passion past the cure of art? Did not the god of Medicine himselfe want; (When he was struck by thee) a soveraigne plant To heale his hurt? nor did it rancor by Abundance of choyce cates and luxurie? 'Twas meerely thy effect. Why then should we To Ceres or to Bacchus deity Assigne our rights? Cupid. In part we must; for they Are aiders in our worke, and therefore may Share in the attributes of power. If wine Did not the spirits and the bloud refine, Making them warme and active, I should throw My shafts at rocks of ice, and from my Bow The winged arrows of desire would flie With empty and succeslesse battery. If Ceres bounties flow'd not, where should I Find any flame to light my torches by? Fulnesse and ease assist me more then all The helpes I have besides. Venus. And therefore shall They be preferr'd? Thou art a foolish boy. Their base effects are lust; they love to joy In what is sensuall onely. Our pure heate Borrowes no activenesse from drinke or meate; It moves more in the soule. God Bacchus shall Have his due attributes, and Ceres call The plough, crookt sickle, flayle and many more Her owne admir'd inventions, and the store Shee gathers for mens use. But should the mind Make these her only objects, what a blind And dangerous issue of effects would grow From such a seed! high spirits strive to know More then a common eye sees, and aspire Still upwards like the Piramide of fire, When earth tends to its centre. We must move More then the sense; else 'tis not perfect love. To them Ceres and Bacchus. Here's Ceres and LyÃ¦us. Ceres. Wee are told By Maia's sonne that you intend to scould With me and Bacchus. Venus. I have cause to chide. You'ld rob me of my titles, and beside Make it a gluttons tenent, there can be No love without you. Ceres. And your Deity Hath summond us for this: 'tis very good. I must confesse you made your father wood To ravish faire Europa. Having seene Traynes of Arcadian Virgins on the greene Tread their chaste measures, or with nimble pace Through the Parthenian groves, and thickets chace A well-breath'd Stagge, one of them straight-wayes must Be tempted to her ruine by his lust: And this employment Venus still is thine. Venus. Ceres is madd still for her Proserpine: Whose rape hath made her queene of the Abysse. Who to be so rewarded would not kisse The blacke lips of hells king? and to his bed Bring the short pleasures of a Maydenhead? Repine not at it then. Ceres. I must whilst day Hath any light, or heavens bright eye a ray. It was your sonnes great act to boast of; he That suffers not th'infernals to goe free Of his diseases. Bacchus. Rather Ceres mine: For if the God had never tasted wine, Not all the heate of his infernall fire Could e're have thaw'd him into one desire; Or kindled the least flame in his cold brest Without my vertue. Venus. 'Tis an idle jest. Doth Bacchus thinke he can with heate of wine Light the bright flame of love, that is divine, And burnes not from such causes, but takes fire From th'elementall part of pure desire Unmixt with grossnesse? Thy effects are foule; And motions of the sense, not of the soule. Subscribe then to our power; my sonne and I Must have the attributes. Ceres. Let him lay by His quiver rather. Ceres meanes to be The Queene of Love, and Bacchus deity Include all that is Cupids. Venus. First I'le leave To be immortall, and my selfe bereave Of all that I can claime above the skye, Or under heavens archt roofe, if destiny May give it confirmation. Take a Dart And ayme it at her proud imperious heart To shew in thy revenge what thou canst doe. Cupid. I must not Mother. Wee'le referre it to Another tryall, and if Bacchus can Confirme what he so saucily began To argue, by example, wee'le deny Nothing that's due unto his deity. Bacchus. Content. To them Christmasse and Shrovetide Enter. Christmas is personated by an old reverend Gentleman in a furr'd gowne and cappe, &amp;c. And Shrovetide by a fat Cooke with a frying-pan, &amp;c. And see occasion hath comply'd Even with our wish. It cannot be deny'd But these share both our bounties; have free use Of all our gifts: and if you'le not refuse A tryall from themâ Venus. Let them speake, whil'st we To their dispose referre the victory. Shrovetide. I say Christmas you are past date, you are out of the Almanack. Resigne, resigne. Let the Oven give place to the Frying-pan, and Minc't-pies yeild superiority to pancakes and Fritters. Christmas. Resigne to thee! I that am the King of good cheere and feasting, though I come but once a yeare to raigne over bak't, boyled, roast, and plum-porridge, will have being in despight of thy lard-ship. Thou art but my fagge-end, and I must still be before thee. Shrovetide. But thou wilt never be before-hand. Thou art a prodigall Christmas; and Shrovetide hath seene thee many times in the Poultry. Christmas. Dost scorne my liberality, thou rasty bacon, tallow-faced scullion? Though thou be as fat as a Flemming, I'le have Lent choke thee with a red-herring. Shrovetide. I'le arme my selfe for that. In three dayes I can victuall my garrison for seven weekes: and it shall goe hard but I will domineere in Lent despite of the thin-chapt surgeon that makes men skillitons. Christmas. As how? Shrovetide. At any Noblemans house, I can licke my fingers in a privy kitchin. Though I bee out of commons in the hall, there's flesh to be had sometimes in a chamber besides a Landresse. The very three-penny ordinary will keepe me in an upper gallery, and I can be invisible even in the pye-house. Should all faile, the wenches I got with child shall long, and have the Phisitians ticket. Christmas. Thou get children! Shrovetide. Yes more then Christmas, and better too: for thine are all unthrifts, whores, or murderers. Thy sonne In and in, undid many a Citizen. Thou hast a Daughter called my Ladyes hole, a filthy black slut shee is; and Put is common in every Bawdy house. 'Tis thought Noddy was none of thine owne getting, but an Aldermans, that in exchange cuckolded thee, when thou wast a Courtier. Thou hast one sonne bred up in the Country called Christmas gambolls, that doth nothing but breake mens necks; and many more that would undoe the Common-wealth, were it not for the Groome porter. Christmas. Do'st see these sirrah? Shrovetide. Ceres and Bacchus: I am their worshipper. Were Stewes tolerated, and Venus the Grand Bawd of them, without good meate and drinke, your young Factors would never be able to breake their Masters or Mistresses, nor your shee-silke-worme in Cheape care a button for her foreman. Ceres. Venus being overcome, I hope will yeeld, Now shee is vanquisht in the open field, And her weake forces scatter'd: nor can they Gather new head to make a second fray. To them Lent enters. Hee is figur'd in a leane Man, his habit like trouses, and what other anticke devices may be thought proper. Venus. Yes: with this champion; and his fresh supply I'le wage new warre, and call backe victory. Shrovetide. This leane thin-gut starveling, begot by a Spaniard, and nurst at the lower end of Friday-street. Lent. Why thou Helluo of hennes and bakon, thou larder house of collops and egges; thou that makest the kitchin proclaime its employment through the neighbourhood, with the sent of thy Lard and crumpets, what canst thou boast of? Christmas. Children, children, thou parcht starveling: thou canst got nothing but Anatomies. Lent. Children. I get more (I maintaine not their lawfulnesse) then Christmas and Shrovetide. Oh the vertue of Oysters, Lobsters, Sturgeon, Anchoves, &amp; Caveary. Why thou grout-headed bladder, puft with the windinesse of pared apples coffered in batter: for every Brawne or hogge, either Christmas or thy selfe have demolisht; I have a thousand Herrings, despight of the Dutchmens wastfull theft, let them rob the foure Seas never so often. Besides, I couple more then the Parson of Pancrace: I meane City woodcocks, with Suburb-wagtailes. Christmas. Thou couple? Lent. Who more? Is not S. Valentines day mine? are not Codds mine, thou codds-head, and Maides mine? put them together thou wilt find they are thingsâ Shrovetide. Thou art a thing of emptinesse, and Lent was ever a Iack by conversion. Lent. Such a Iack as can come aloft, and doe Venus more credit then thy fulnesse. Doe not I share of Aries, Taurus, and Gemini; the Innes I lye at in my progresse. Yet no cuckold can deny but Aries and Taurus should follow Gemini. And it follows, or should, that I having two fathers my selfe, should get most children. Christmas. Who were thy fathers prethee? Lent. Devotion and Pollicy; and I have begotten Hipocrisie on a holy sister, that despight of all Informers would have flesh, her belly full. Let Christmas and Shrovetide eate and drinke; I'le be for Venus, though I feed upon nothing but herring-cobbs. Venus. Who's now the conqueror? Will Ceres now Subscribe unto my power? and Bacchus bow To Cupids awefull strength? Ceres. Not till it is Confirm'd by better evidence then his. Lent. Then mine Observe. Here the ScÃ¦ne suddenly changeth into a Prospect, with trees budded, the earth somewhat greene, and at one side an old Barne, out of which issues a company of beggars, with a Bag-pipe. See you these good fellowes, that preferre the warme Sunne, before the scrapps which niggardly Christmas and Shrovetide feast them with; and would get a better race under a hedge to people New England, then the Seperatists that possesse it. Whilst they entertaine yee, Ile summon the Spring, and she shall moderate. The Beggars dance. Exeunt. After the dance, is heard the chirping of birds; and whilst the following Song is singing, the ScÃ¦ne againe changeth into a pleasant Arbour, in which the Spring in a greene robe wrought over with flowers presents her selfe. The Song. See, see a Metamorphosis, The late gray field now verdant is. The Sun with warme beames glads the earth, And to the springing flowers He gives a new and lively birth By th'ayde of gentle showres. The Lambes no longer bleate for cold, Nor cry for succour from the old: But friske and play with confidence Like Emblemes of true innocence. Chorus. The cheerefull birds their voyces straine, The Cuckow's hoarse for want of raine. The Nightingale doth sweetly sing, To welcome in the joyfull Spring. Spring. Thus breake my gloryes forth that late lay hid Within the icye earth, and were forbid By Winters nipping cold to show their heads Above the snowy covering of their beds. The winds not rugged now, but calme and fayre, Sweepe flowry Gardens, and perfume the ayre. The woods shrill Choristers (whose frozen throtes Lated wanted motion,) now have found their notes; Strayning their little organes to sound high, And teach men art from Natures harmony. Come you to welcome me? Ceres. Yes lovely Maid; And to have judgement from you, who most aide In Loves great worke. Spring. Is there a strife betweene The goddesse of desire, and plenties Queene? Will they subscribe, Ile moderate. All. Content. Spring. First heare my reasons; then my sentence: bent 'Gainst neithers honours; for I must comply With both as vertues. Venus Deity Is powerfull over all; and Ceres gives Each that hath being that by which he lives. Yet many times excesse perverts the end Of pure intentions; and extreames extend Their powers to undoe those acts are free In their owne natures from impuritie.
