      <field name="fulltext">To the hopefull paire of noble brothers, Cornet George Porter, and Mr. Charles Porter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Bellamente, Clariana. Cla. You shanot goe, indeed you shanot Bel. Lady. Cla. Vnlesse the fault of your poore entertainment Bel. Nay now you trespasse, and dishonour me With a suspition that I can be so Vnjust, as not to acknowledge, you haue made A free, and liberall welcomeâbut excuse Cla. Love shall supply, what else hath beene defective, To expresse my thankes for your kind visit Bel. Tis Businesse that now ravish me away By this white hand, which but to kisse, would tempt me To dwell an age here, I must waite vpon The Duke Cla. Why so you may Bel. Tis now my time. Cla. You are not tied to such a strict obseruance That halfe an houre can preiudice you, come I know you may dispence with dutie so much. Bel. You may command; Cla, Not any thing that shall Reflect iniurious to your selfe, Bel. I know You haue more charity. Cla. If there be other Cause, that concernes your honor, or your fortune, Trust me, I would not by a minites stay Be guilty of your wrong, and yet me thinkes If there were any thing you might tell me; Ther's not a thought, that I dare keepe from you, No sigh but you may know from whence it breakes, I haue not had a teare, but you haue searchd The very spring, come ist some other friend? Bel. O doe not so farre wound your servant Madam To thinke my heart can allow any time For the imagination of another Woman, did all the goodnesse of the sexe Conspire in one without you, I should loue My first election, and be blest to write All my devotion here; if by the title Of friend, you vnderstand a man, there is But one in the whole world I dare call friend, And I am confident it would trouble me As much to find a cause that would offend him As to be guilty of the sinne. Cla. Hippolito. Bel. If he expected me a day, the crime Were easily purg'd, I can presume on him Cla. This is but little of that Character I haue heard your tongue deliuer, if his loue Be what you often haue proclaimd, trust me He is a treasure Bel. Such as both the Indies Sha'not buy, from me, Cla. What thing's rare in him 'Bove other friends? Bel. His love his love Clariana; Cla. That may be found in many Bel. But not so rich of so exact a nature All other is but drossie; Cla. He will venture His life to aduance your cause Bel. He has don't often But that is not the thing for which I bosome Hippolite, I can returne full weight Of blood for his, engage my selfe to dangers As high and horrid as he can for me, But every daring fellow in the street Can draw a sword, and will for his gay honour Which swaies him more then his religion, I'th field maintaine a good or impious quarrell: But he is such a one to me, the name Of friend's too narrow for him, and I want A word that carries more divinitly To expresse his love. Cla. You are not nice to extoll him, What has he done? Bel. An act above all friendship That yet had story, bov'e all recompence I am not capable of a cause, to quit His vnexampled vertue; Cla. This is strange Bel. You will acknowledge when you heare it, and It does concerne you somewhat. Cla. Me, pray let not My ignorance make me so vnhappy, not To give my thankes if he hath aym'd apat Of curtesie to me, what ist? Bel. He dares not see thee Cla. Dares not see me why Am I so terrible? does he feare I shall Transforme him? sure Minerva never drest My haires, he should imagine I present Medusa to him, dares not see me? I Shoot no infection, nor breath any mist That shall corrupt him, whats his reason pray? Bel. Because I love thee, I ha courted him As some would do their mistresse, but to be Companion of one visit, and his love Would not permit him Cla. Not to see your friend. Bel. He loves me so well, that he dares not trust His frailty with thy sight, whom I have so Commended, least before our marriage Some thing should share in his affection Which he hath studied to preserue intire For me, he will not trust his eyes with any Beauty I loue, least they should stray with too much Licence, and by degrees corrupt his faith He knowes not what may theiue upon his seness Or what temptation may rise from him. To undoe us all Cla. A rare and noble friendship. Bel. Ist not Clariana? Cla. He need not feare I shall Commit a rape upon his friendship, and A love so just and perfect as his, cannot With one sight of a woman, armd with more Beauty then mine, be violated; He dares not trust his frailty, he has faults Belike though he be such a miracle In friendship, pray enioy him, and by no meanes Tempt his soft nature to a crime so great As seeing me, it shall suffice my love's To thee inviolable, and what opinion For your sake, I may modestly allow The man I never saw, because your friend Be confident he has it. Bel. Thar't all sweetnesse But I forget my attendance on the Duke Now you allow my absence, vertuous thoughts Streame in your bosome. Cla. Not one kisse at parting? Bel. Let one speake the devotion of your servant That would but dares not stay, to print a thousand. Cla. Milena. Exit. Mil. Madam. Cla. Is Bellamente gone? Mil. Yes Madam Cla. I must see this strange friend, bid make ready The Caroch, and do attendâ Mil. I shall Cla. Dares not trust his frailty with a woman, a fine fellow Enter Hippolito. Courtier. Hip. Eubella come to Court Cour. This morning Sir And much grac'd by the Duke, Sebastian Her father made a Knight Hip. A Knight? Wy much good doot him, hee's a gentleman may deserve it for his daughters sake. The Duke has the advantage, he is able to make great men, there is no bande to a round pension per annum, or the severe brow of authority, promotion will turne the stomack, we under-sinners o'the commonwealth, ha nothing but our good parts to procure for us, she is like to become game royall then. Cour. The Duke pretends she shall be in some place neere the Duchesse, Hip. In some neere place with the Duke, when the Duchesse is in another bed and never Dreames on't; she may intime be a gamster, in the meane time the Duke will play at Cards with her, and if he chance turne up a coate, the honor shall be hers, and a stock perhaps to set up the precious sinne withall, is she not yet Ladified? Cour. She is in the way to rise Hip. Thou art mistaken, she is in the way to fall, a hansome Gentlewoman and new come to Court, in the high way to fall too, if any thing will doot, the Duke has taken a course to take in her Maiden towns. Cour. Did not you love her? Hip. No faith, I cannot properly say I did ever love her, she was too honest, if she have praid since, she has beene sorry for loving me so well,âshe was too wise to be a whoore, and I was not so much a foole to marry, till my time were come, Cour. What time? Hip. Why the fall of the leafe, when my Summer is over, the Dog-days may do much wo me, marry before one and thirty? a solescisme, tis more honorable to be a peepe out, then stand at a single game, tis neither Courtly nor fashionable, and whats become of her wise brother? Cour. He cannot do amisse in the generall aduancement, if his father and sister riseâ Hip. He must needs shew a high forehead, tis such a dog in a wheele, hee'le never become a doublet in fashion, he talkes as if he had read Poetry out of Almanacks, and makes a leg like a Farmer, I wonder who begot him? Cour. His father. Hip. What father? It had beene a question, had his mother beene a Courtier, and not liv'd and died honest in the Country, they that looke upon him, and his sister, would never think two, Poliux and Helena, twinnes, i'th same egge, yet she may be a good hen hereafter and lay, but and he be not addled, he is wiser then his nurse tooke him for Cour. Will you not see 'em in? Hip. Where are they? Co. I'th garden where the Duke hath beene this halfe houre in private discourse with her Hip. No Ile backe agen, I ha not eaten to day, and I dare not looke upon an honest woman fasting, tis ominous, and we have too many fisndayes already, if the Duke aske for me make some excuse, Co. I owe my preferment to you, and you may challenge my services, Enter Bellamente. Bel. Friend whither in such hast Hip. If thou lov'st me interrupt me not, I dare not stay, there are new things at Court, and I ha not provided a complement yet Ile see thee anon. Bel. Farewell. Wild as the wind some crochet has possest him And he is fixt to follow't he but wants A litle pruning, and no Courtier Could grow up more accomplisht, I could wish him An ounce or two of snow to qualifie Some fury in his blood, were there no women He would be a brave man, but why do I Trouble my selfe, that am secure? the Duke. Enter Duke leading Eubella, Sebastian, Bovalda, Court. Du. You are too modest Eu. That was not wont to be a vice my Lord Or if it be too homely for the Court And out of fashion, with your highnes pardon I shall be welcome with it, to the place I came from. Seb. Hold that constant my Eubella. Du. Will you still be ignorant? Bo. Is not that your daughter? Seb. She was Bo. Has she found another father? Seb. She has found a miserie Bo. Let them tell the markes that lost it and take it agen By my consent Du. Bellamente Bel. My Lord Du. Is she not an excellent creature, wer't not pitty That so much beautie should be cast away Vpon a thanklesse woman? Be. How sir Du. That wonot use it to her best advantage? I have beene courting this houre for A smile. Bel. I like not this Seb. Nor I. Bel. I cannot but congratulate your good fortune Seb. Do not, do not You ever have beene held an honest man. Pray, do not mock me, it has pleas'd his grace To give, me a new name; a riban in my forehead Bo. Sebastian's a forehorse-but would I were to be the Dukes taster, Seb. But there's a price too great set for the honor, That is my daughter sir, and though I say't She is yet a virgin, would you part with such A child to buy a Knighthood? bribe at such Expence for a poore title? Bel. Tis darke language I dare not understand you, but you may Mistake the Duke Seb. I wod I did, the way To be assurd is to aske the question sir Du. Sebastian you put us well in mind, we have forgot You have too litle testemonie of our favour You shall be Captaine of our Guard Bo. Howes that? the Duke does love her, I hope not Honestly, she was not borne to he a Dutchesse, I have it Heaven forgive us, the Duke meanes to make her owne father the Pander, tis so, he does not use to give such offices for nothing, well go thy wayes for a princely Ferret, she cannot hold out upon these termes Seb. I know not what to say, but do you thinke She shall be safe here, is the Court a Sanctuary For virgins? Bo. Tw'ere better you were both pickeld, Seb. It depends upon the Princes chastity Whose example builds up vertue Or makes iniquity a trade Du. Why should you Be such an enemy to your selfe, come faire one Thinke who it is that Courts you, he that may Command. Eu. My life but not my honor. Du. Your honor? why I offer in exchange A thousand. Eu. But not all of value, to Repurchase mine, when I have sold it to Your wantonnesse, remember sir how much, You may by one black deed, make forfeit of, Your precious eternity Du. No doctrines Eu. Warrant not so much ill by your example To those that live beneath you, if you suffer, That sordid vice raigne in your blood, who shano't Be a fraid to live with vertue Du. Let a kisse correct this vnkind language Bo. I want patience to see any man kisse A hansome Gentlewoman, and when my owne lips Cannot use their owne priviledge, I prophesie what will Become on her, for all her modesty, but dare stay No longer the sight of so much temptation. Seb. Why should any Promotion charme my honest tongue? Ide rather Plough my owne acres with my innocence Then have my name advanc'd by poisoned honor, He must not Whoore my daughter Be. I commend. Your noble soule, but be advis'd how you Expresse your trouble, griefe while it is dumb Doth fret within, but when we give our thoughts Articulate sound we must distinguish hearers, Princes are dangerous and carry death Vpon their tongue, I wish you well and speake My friendly counsellâ'las poore gentleman! Du. Come you must weare this Iewell, I ha don, But you must live at Court Eu. You will be just To your owne honor, and not give me cause To curse your entertainement Du. Y'are too scrupulous. Seb. Great sir Du. Give order for his Patent to be drawne We will create him Lord, no honor can Reward your merit, and the title will Become the father of this excellent maide Co. His mouth's stopd agen. 2. Lord? What does the Duke meane? 1., 3. No harme to the Gentlewoman. 2 Co. If these wonot purchase the old mans consent to leave his Daughter to his highnesse mercie, for he rises that she may be humbled, there are other courses to be thought on, Sebastian has beene a Souldier, there are quarrells now in the world and Christian warres he were a fit man for a Generall when hee's abroad, the siege at home wonot be so desperate. 1. Co. She must be the Court Starre: 2. Co. Do not you blaze it abroad neither, I do not Thinke his grace will acquaint his counsell With such a cause 3. The old man for ought I see has no stomack to it: Du. Wheres Hippolito? 1. Co. I see him this morning. Du. He is an active Courtier, practis'd in these amorous Paths, weele try his skill to winne her to our Close embrace, command him presently waite on vs Bellamenti. Seb. We heare you are to be married. Eu. Ill tell you more hereafter I do not like the Court, and yet I have His royall word no force shall touch my chastity. Seb.

Are you Melancholy? a Maske is prepared, and Musicke to charme Orpheus himselfe into a stone, numbers presented to your eare that shall speake the soule of the immortall English Ionson, 2 scene to take your eye with wonder, now to see a forrest move, and the pride of summer brought into a walking wood, in the instant as if the sea had swallowed up the earth, to see waves capering about tall ships, Arion upon a rocke playing to the Dolphins, the Tritons calling up the sea-Nimphes to dance before you: in the height of this rapture a tempest so artificiall and suddaine in the clouds, with a generall darkenes and thunder so seeming made to threaten, that you would cry out with the Marriners in the worke, you cannot scape drowning, in the turning of an eye, these waters ravish into a heaven, glorious and angelicall shapes presented, the starres distinctly with their motion and musick so inchanting you, that you would wish to be drowned indeed, to dwell in such a happinesse Eu. Fine painted blessings! Hip. Will you feast, the water shall be summond to bring in her finny and shell inhabitants, the aire shall be unpeopled, and the birds come singing to their sacrifice, Banquets shall spread like wildernesses, and present more variety then men can possibly take in surfets. Are you sicke? all the Court shall take phisick for you, if but your finger ake, the Lords shall put on night-caps, and happiest that Courtier that can first betray how much he suffers with you. Doth not this Pallace please, the Court remoues to morrow: doth the Scituation distast, new places are built, and piramids to put downe the Egyptians: will you hunt to day? the game is provided and taught newes to delight you: will you take the pleasure of the River? the Barge attends, Musicke and the Marmaides go a long, Swannes dy a long the shores and sing their owne dirges: will you spend? the Exchequer is yours all honor and offices yours, and which is the crowne of all, the Duke himselfe is yours, whose ambition shall be to make those pleasures lasting, and every day create new ones to delight his Mistresse. Eu. And yet I thinke you would not give away Your right hand for all these, much lesse present A poniard to your heart and stab your selfe. Hi. I thinke I should not. Eu. And would you tempt me to do worse? Hi. Worse? Eu. To sell my honor basely for these vanities Hi. Vanities? Eu. Meere trifles. Hi. And you go to that Lady, that which you part withall for All these pleasures, is but a trifle Eu. What? Hi. Your maidenhead? where is it? who ever saw it? Is it a thing in nature? what markes has it? many have beene lost you'ld say, who ever found em'? and could say and iustifie, this is such or such a womans maidenhead? a mere fiction, and yet you thinke you have such a iewell on't Eu. You cannot be so ignorant as you seeme Hi. I tell you what I thinke. Eu. Is chastity and innocence no treasure? Are holy thoughts and virgin puritie Of so small value? where is your religion? Were we created men and women to Have a command and empire ore the creatures And shall we loose out priviledge our charter And wilfully degrad our selves of reason And piety, to live like beasts, nay be such? For what name else can we allow our selves? Hath it been held in every age a vertue Rather to suffer death then staine our honor? Does every sinne stricke at the soule and wound it And shall not this, so foule as modesty Allowes no name, affright us? can the Duke Whose wicked cause you plead, with justice punish Those by his lawes that in this kind offend, And can he thinke me Innocent, or himselfe When he has plaid the foule adulterer? Princes are gods on earth and as their virtues Doe shine more exemplary to the world So they stricke more immediately at heaven When they offend. Hi. I did not trouble you with this divinity, Eu. I see you are a Gentleman he favours Be worthy of his trust, and counsell him To better wayes, his shame is your dishonor; For every good man suffers with his prince: Put him in the memory of the holy vow, When he received his Septer He promis'd then protection to the innocent: Tell him the punishment in store for lust This were an Angels office. Hi. But Ile not doo't for a hundred angells, thanke you as much As though I did, that were the tricke of a wise Courtier, tell The Prince of his faults Eu. If he have but the seeds of goodnesse in him Hee'll take it well Hi. He shall doe when I take it upon me, I am not weary o'my place, thou wodst make a very fine Court Surgeonâwell dee heare, you wo'not doe this feate for the Duke then? Eu. I dare not. Hi. You wonot y'are resolv'd for his sake, why then prethee doo't for mine, you told me once you lov'd me, Ile take it as a courtesie; Eu. I never lov'd your vicious wayes; Hi. My wayes, they shanot trouble you, Ile take my owne Course, meet him but to night for my sake and twine with him. Eu. Ile sooner meete with a disease, with death; You are ignoble, do you urge it as An argument of my respect to you To sinne against my love? Hi. I shall do no good upon herâwere I the Duke, you should Find another usage. Eu. A tirant might do any thing Enter Duke Du. How now is she moist and supple? Will she stoope to the impression? Hi. I told you sir, I was not arm'd toth' purpose, you tooke me unprovided, at the next bou't I may do somewhat, ith meane time let me Counsell you, to let her feed high, shee'le never fall low enough else, she must be dieted, if you let her pick her sallets, you may fast another Lent, and all our paines be not worth an egge at Easter.

Grow not from fraile to impudent, Cla. You are resolved To be impatient? when you are collected Bel. Stay I will heare, indeed I will, say any thing Cla. First then you have no cause to accuse Hippolito For breach of friendship, had he purpos'd any Dishonor to your selfe through me, he could not Be such a foole to send you to his chamber Whoe's knowledge, it should last of all the world Arrive at, if you soberly consider. He knowes not so much of me, as my name; Thinke then but with what justice, you have all This while inveighed against himâfor my selfe I confesse freely sir I made a visit But innocently and pure from any thought To iniure you; I had a curiosity To see the man you had so much commended That was my fault, and I before you came Accusd my selfe, and could without your furie. Have chid my modesty enough. Yet sir You tooke me in no action of dishonour My maide was all my company. Bel.

Like mine? Cla. I ha said it Tis you have made a greater fault then I, With so much violence to condemne before You know the offence, and I must tell you sir But that my love is grounded upon virtue, This were enough to stagger my affection Raile at your Mistresse but for going abroad To see your friend? so just a one?

I should name my husband often to arme and fortifie our selves, I confesse, I do not wish him here, perhaps he would do some mischiefe, and hinder another meeting, but if he were present now, and should see us kisse, for and he' were ten husbands, I would trust his eyes no further, what could he say? for he did but kisse her, for he did but kisse her, and so let her go: come for shame be more sprightly, I have as much reason to looke about, and play my game wisely, if my Cards were considerd.

Bel. Treacherous serpent Hip. With this I have sometime releeud your valour And had no pitty of my blood, but then I was a friend, in such a cause as this I have no arme no weapon, not, if I Were sure the bullet would decline my heart. It does beget a cowardise to thinke How I am falne. Cla. O pardon Bel. Pardon with what conscience canst thou aske it? Hip.

Exeunt. Enter Bonaldo and a Courtier. Bon. Not at the Court? why he desired I should meet him here Cour. The Duke hath often asked for him Bon. He waites well in the meane time, who in the name of wantonnesse keepes him away, I know tis a wench, tis a parlous boy, my owne sonne to a haire, and he should not love a woman I would disinherit him, for I am of opinion an Athist sometime is better then an Eunuch, And yet cannot the Court find him game enough, but he must leape the pale and straggle so farre for Venison, that the Duke must hunt after him; and he were not my owne flesh and bloud, I would counsell him to marry, but they are dangerous, and a disease is more curable then a wife, for she indeed is a hectick feaver, although I buried mine seven yeere agoe, yet I feele a grudging of her still, and for a need could guesse at the change of weather by the knowledge her noise has infusd into my bones. Enter Duke, Courtiers. Cour. The Duke. Du. Some one looke out Hippolito Bo. If please your grace let it be my imployment Du. Signior Bonaldo? Bo.

Tis a tricke he learnd in France sir, where your nobility practise, he will leave it, when Capring and Kissing are out of fashion with Gentlemen Du. Oh he is young, I have heard you were as wild at his Yeeres, Bo. And wilder too I should be sorry else Du. How? Bo. I had ne're broke my wives heart else, with supping abroad and midnight revells, I should ha beene troubled with her till this time Du. She was a shrew it seemes? but you promise actively still? Bo.

Lady, I am sent to know your full and finall resolution touching the businesse the Duke propounded, though your father be shut up yet change of aire is fitter for your complexion, the Duke is a Gentleman that may command in these parts, tis not for want of provision, the Duke has a mind to cut up your virginity. Eu. If this be your affaire sir, tell the Duke Eubella is a rocke. Hip. Thats very hard Eu. His mermaids cannot winne me with their songs Nor all his tempests shake me Hip. Stay a litle There's something more in my commission Eu. Hippolito I now have argument to thinke you were Not borne a Gentleman, something, here is witnesse I pittie thee, this is no noble office Hip. You meane a pander it ha's been a thriving way for some, But I am imployed by his grace. Eu. Shall feare or flattery Corrupt a generous soule? I am a woman The weakest of a thousand yet I dare Give man example, rather to be sacrificed. Then betray vertues cause, we give our life To grow agen, from our owne funerall pile Like the Assyrian brid. Hip Thou hast so rich A stocke of goodnesse, were all other women Vitious, thou mightst impart enough to make The whole sexe white agen, and leave thy selfe One degree lesse then angell: canst thou pardon That I have tempted thee so farre? thy hand To give it a relligious kisse, when next My tongue is orator in so foule a cause The argument it selfe turne a disease And eate it to the roote. I am chang'd Eubella And more to trie thy strength then to orecome I speake nowe for the Duke, keepe still thy thoughts Deuout to honor, after I have studied A yeares repentance for my wrongs to thee, I will presume to say I love Eubella Eu. But hath Hippolito no other meaning? I understand, and take some ioy to heare this language Hip. The first proofe of my conversion Shall be to tell the Duke he has done ill To court thee sinfully Enter Duke. Du. Howes this? Eu. Pray do not mocke, if you knew how much, Delight heaven takes to heare you speake so well To the distressed Eubella. Hi. By this lip If my profane touch make thee not offended Theres is no good I will not act, nor ill I will not suffer to deserue thy love But I am miserable and cannot merit I have not beene at home these many yeeres Yet I will call my conscience to account For all, and throw my selfe upon heavens charity, Why dost thou weepe? Eu. My ioy can weare no other livery Then teares, and confident all this is truth I cannot keepe it in, you shall dispose Eubellas heart. Hi. Then here I take it in To my possession Du. Vilaine Strumpet Hi. Sir, here are none such I can assure your highnesse Du. Is this your faith to me? Hi. I never did you. True service till this minute, and I dare Now tell you, though you cut my head off, tis Not justice to pursue the ruine of A harmelesse maid Du. Traytor Hi. Call me some Name, I understand my Lord This virgin now is mine. Du. Your whoore Hi. This cannot make me yet forget your person Eu. Sir I beseech you. Du. By my Dukedome Hi. The more you vex the more we grow together In honor and chast love Du. You speake as if You were to be her husband, Hi. Tis a title a prince should be ambitious of. Du. Very fine Do you consent too, to be cald his wife? Eu. If he dare make me such there is no second My heart affects. Du. Ist come to this? then heare what I determine Eu. Sir consider Du. I have considered do not interrupt me Too morrow if I live Ile see you both Married, thou excellent maide forgive my passion, Accept him freely, thou hast overcome With chastity, and taught me to be a prince Which character, my lust had neere defac'd Release Sebastian. Eu. What dutie can poore Eubella pay? Du. No more, good deeds reward themselves, how have we slept. Hi. This exceeds all your favours Du. Cherish my gift Hippolito, she is a wife for the best prince, no honor can be enough to satisfie thy vertue. Exit, Co.

Cry you mercie Signior, indeed he is not here Bo. How is it with your beauteous Clariana? Bel. Shee's well Bo. Pray commend my service to her Bel. What said yee? Bo. Nothing but my service to your Lady Bel. Oh I thanke you, pray stay, and tell me how I looke Bo. Looke? Bel. They will perswade me within I am not well I must confesse there is some cause of melancholy Within me. Bo. I guest so at first sight, may I presume to aske it? Bel. And yet does not concerne me in a higher nature then My friend, a scuruy chance late hapn'ed to him One that he lov'd most deerely, you will scarce Beleeve, made him a Cuckold Bo. That all? Bel. That all. Dee understand what I have said? Bo. Yes a friend was made a Cuckold by a friend He did his wife and him a curtesie. Bel. Go home and pray, y'are in a desperate state This is enough to weigh thee downe to hell Bo. I am not of your mind, and I had don't my selfe, I should Never had so much despaire as to hang my selfe, why tis as Common as shifting a trencher Bel. But harke you sir, how ere you talke you cannot in your judgement thinke so, are yon married? Bo. What dee see in my forehead you should thinke me so miserable? Bel. Ile tell you then, what a wife is, or should be Bo. I can tell you, what they should be, Bel. What? Bo. They should be honest and love their husbands, and for their Sakes their bastards, which if they understand they are bound, to keepe, because their ill conditions drive us a broad to get 'em. Bel. No, heare me. A wife is mans best peece, who till he marries Wants making up, she is the shrine to which Nature doth send us forth on Pilgrimage, She was a syens taken from that tree Into which if she have no second grafting The world can have no fruit, she is mans Arithemeticke which teaches him to number And multiply himselfe in his owne children, She is the good mans Paradise, and the bads First step to heaven, a treasure which who wants Cannot be trusted to posterity Nor pay his owne debts, she is a golden sentence Writ by our maker, which the Angells may Discourse of, only men know how to use And none but devills violate Bo. All this youle justifie a wife Bel. Now tell me Signior what punishment That man deserves, that should deface or steale This wealth away. Bo. How meane you in the way of lying with her? I am of my first opinion, there is not much treason In't, if she be hansome Bel. But is there no respect of friendship to be observ'd? Bo. Nor kindred much in such a case Bel. Would you not chide your sonne that should abuse his Deere friends wife or Mistresse? Bo. Yes if he should abuse her, but if he did but ly with her I should commend him, make the case your owne would you deny a friend that wanted linnen the curtesie of your cleane shirt? a woman is a more necessary wearing, and yet never the worse for't Bel. Away thou wot infect my dwelling else, To what a monster, is man growne Bo. Fare you well sir, I ha but answered to your questions Bel.

Ile not take from her I have heard her much commended, but she is No miracle Hi. How Clariana. Cla. Our sex were poore If she alone had all the grace of woman. Though she be faire, the Dukedome is not so Barren but it may shew some parralell. And let it not be thought a pride, if I Affirme there have beene those, have said as much Of me, all beavty is not circumscribd In one. Hi. You point at that which takes the Eye And is but halfe a hansomnesse at best Vnlesse the mind be furnished with those vertues Which write a woman faire, but Clariana There is no time for this dispute, and I Am some what sorry you have falne upont When I but praisd Eubella modestly, She is to me the best and fairest now Of all the world, but turne to the occasion That brought me hither, I would heare what practise Is meant against my life, which I would now Preserue for that deere virgin, more then love To keepe it for my use, I did imagine How ever Bellamente shewed a formall And calme release, yet he would meditate Revenge at such a time he most should wound me And had not I a perfect confidence Your thoughts meant simple pitty to my danger I should not thus farre have engaged my self, Then I beseech you tell me Cla. Any thing. Hi. Why dee delay me thus Clariana? Cla. Pardon o pardon me Hippolito Indeed I will discover all the plot Hi. I am prepard, Cla.

Not marry her, why theres no steele can bring So certaine and so violent a death, Forsake Eubella now, now when shee's drest My glorious bride, the Nuptiall ceremonie And Priest expecting us, I know you speake not In hope I should beleeve, you may as well Bid me commit a murder on my life For this will kill her and we both are one. Who hath instructed you to this? Cla. My love My love that will not suffer me to know Thou must be given thus away for ever I could endure thy absence for whole yeeres And not complaine, repent my equall sorrow We have so farre offended, while you keepe Your present freedome, there were then some hope A possiblity, at last to meet In new affections to redeeme the old But thus my expectation is destroyd, You understand? Hi. Too much, be not deceived, There is no love that is not vertuous And thy consenting thus farre but in thought Is sacriledge, and thou dost rob the Church Twice, first in violation of thy vowes Which there were registred, and then mine expected I dare not heare you talke thus Cla. Is this all? All the reward for loosing of my selfe For thy sake? Hip. Y'are not yet quite lost Cla.

I can prevent his furie Against thee Hi. There is no way Cla. Yes this. Hi. Ha divell what hast done? Mi. Alas what ha you both done? Cla. I thanke thee Thou hast spar'd my execution on my selfe Ile tell thee now Hippolito, by this This crimson in whose ebbe my life hasts from me I did not looke for Bellamente, but Surprisd I thought it honor to beg in The tragedy, I know my fate was not To be resisted, twas impossible. To find a second mercy from him, and I would secure no woman after me Should boast the Conquest of Hippolito Thy sword was gentle to me, search't againe And thou shalt see. How my embracing blood will keepe it warme And kisse the kind destroyer Enter Bellamente and Servants, Milena runns in. Bel. What are you humbled? must not serve your turne. Cla.

Now thou hast met a justice in thy blood For thy first sinne, but I will have a Surgeon Hi. Send for Eubella rather Oh let me breath my last upon her lips It will concerne thee Bellamente somewhat The world will think this murder was thine else Bel. Make hast: O woman thou didst weepe once, when thy teares Won my forgivenesse, where are all the drops, The penitent showers, in which thy stained soule Should bath it selfe, this minute lanching forth To thy eternity. Cla. Th'are of another colour, oh forgive me Good heaven, I have wrongd thee Bellamente Oh wives hereafter, meane your hearts to them You give your holy vowes, what mist weighs downe My eyes already, oh tis death I see In a long robe of darkenesse is preparing To seale them up for ever, twere no death, If we could loose our sinnes as we do breath Bel.
