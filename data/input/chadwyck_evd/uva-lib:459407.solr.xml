      <field name="fulltext">Chori Princeps Rhetorici. THE SCHOOLE MODERATOR: OR ?????????. The Combat Of Caps</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VENI, VIDE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nella ??? ??? la ??</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The whole draught of the Invention moves upon two principall Hinges: 1. The maine Plot, or ?? ?????. 2. The Counter-plot, ?? ????????. The first designes forth the Orders of the Place in point of Government; the other, the Didacticall part, in way of Method, thus, in order following. 1. The Maine Plot represents the Fundamentall discipline in ordine ad Regimen usitatum Loci: and is wrapt up in the first part of the Title, (Princeps Rhetoricus) In relation to the Authority of the Schoole Prince, his five Seniors, and twelve Sub-seniors or Keepers, throughout the whole yeere, and consisteth of two Dramaticall parts: 1. Citement. 2. Inditement. The Citement summons the Officers, Seniors, Sub-seniors, and Juniors in the five first Classes, at the Instalment of their Prince. The Inditement belongs to the Fresh-men and Sub-juniors of the fift and sixt Forme, according as they stand severally charged by their Seniors. 2. The Counter-plot layes forth (????????) our Methodicall Exercise, alternis diebus, three dayes a week, i. e. Grammatically and Rhetorically on Tuesday; Poetically on Thursday; Logically on Saturday, viz. upon some Thema simplex, some one word Problematically given forth upon Munday morning: As Cubus, Æra, Sphæra, Annus, severall weeks, severall words, canvased Philologically through the Grammarians, Lexicons, Glossaries, Nomenclators, Criticks, Historians, quasi opus Philologicum: and also hunted through the Arithmeticians and Cosmographers quasi Exercitium Mathematicum: and forthwith out of the present Result the Declamers come forth, quasi Praxis Rhetorica: this for Tuesday perennitèr: the Books being laid by the Librarie keepers præ manibus in ordine ad Classes; and the Exercise recorded in three severall Books, and kept by ??????????,, the keeper of the weekly Papers. Now the Thesis or Controversall word for the present was Pileum, a Cap, being the garbe of the place. But occasionally at this time è re natâ; For a negligent young Student of the House had lost his Colledge Bonnet, whose name, together with his losse, renewed the old Schoole-game, The Parson has lost his Cap, and so fell in accidentally to be the Basis of the Counter-plot, and gave the Title ?????????. The subject of the second, third, fourth Acts, debated Academically. And thus the two Plots interweave all the yeare Scholasticè, Methodi gratiâ. And to day Dramaticè, Compendii causa, ut mundus in Tabellula, The Essay of a Fortnights study. And thus much for the Argument at large.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons of the Rhetoricall Drama, are the same with the Domesticall Students, distinguished by a three-fold degree: In ordine ad 1. Officia. Their Titles and Offices. In ordine ad 2. Classes. Their Formes and places. In ordine ad 3. Ætates. Their Ages. 1. The Office is two-fold: 1. Schoole-Officers, 2. Court-Officers; yet both Mercuriall: Onely the first more properly attend the businesse of the Publique Weale, or Schoole; the other the pleasure of the Prince, or Moderator. That respects Substance, this Ceremony. 2. The Classes are ever six, with an Entrance, termed Vestibulum. 3. The Ages were not here much materiall to the Plot; yet the Plot is materiall to the Ages. Fiat Æmulatio, &amp; Pudor. Now as for the termes of the distinct Titles and Places, they will hardly admit of English; being originally imposed, and still used in Greek or Latine, which are the indispensable dialect of the province; and yet we will venture here to rank them in a triple Paralles. 1. ??????????? ??, or ???????????. Seniores. Old standers. 2. ????????. Juniores. Succeeders. 3. ??????????? Tyrones. Fresh-men. The two first, in order to their Charge, are called ???????, Keepers, or Guards-men; but in another sense, ??????, ?????????, or ??????????, quasi è specula decernentes: in a Grammaticall Acception, Overseers, Watchmen, Spies. For in this Utopia, the main businesse is ???????, Custodia, Tuitio, Excubatio. Watch and Ward, ????????????, where every Officer stands Centinel in the defence of Decencie, and defiance of Rudenesse: for as ?? ?????, decent order, is ?? ??????, so it is the ?? ???????, the guarded treasure, the golden Apple of our Hesperian Garden. Ordo Anima rerum, and needs many watchfull eyes to guard it; Tot Argi oculati, vigiles? Dracones. And thus in order following stands the Posture of our Schoole Model, ?? ??????????? ???????: And therefore in Rank and File, see them here upon their march, facing the Spectators. Officiorum Tituli Specifici: The Officers in their Three-fold Order. 1. Office. 2. Classis. 3. Ætat. Anno. ?? ?????. Princeps Rhetoricus. School-Moderator. ????????? Moderator Mercurialis. Decider of Controversies. 1. 12. ?????????. &amp; Monitor Monitorum. Keeper of Keepers. ????????? Legumq, Custos. Defender of the Laws, and Mr. of Requests. 1. 13. The foure prime Monitors. 1. ?????????. Præses succelli. President of the Chappel. 2. 13. 2. ???????????. Decentiarum explorator. quest-man of Decencie. 2. 12. 3. ???????????. Linguarum Custos. Monitor of Language. 2. 13. 4. ???????????. Ingenii speculator. Observer of Invention. 3. 13. ??????????. The twelve Sub-officials, or subordinate Monitor or Keepers. Offic. Class. Ætat. 1. ? ??????????. Præfectus Scrinii Rhetorici. Chiefe Register of Exercise. 3. 14 2. ? ?????????????. Librarius. Producer of Auth. Keeper of the three School Libraries. 3. 14 3. ? ?????????. Ostiarius. Commander of the keyes and hatches. 3. 14 4. ??????, five ???????. Nolæ Curator. The Timer of the Bell &amp; hourglasse. 3. 13 5. ?????????. Lucifer. Orderer of the lights. 4. 13 6. Cubiculorum decurio. Chief Chamberlain and searcher of studies. 4. 14 7. Præses limitaneus. Marquesse of the Bounds. 4. 14 8. Aulæ mensor. Controller of the Hall. 4. 13 9. Silcutarius. Vsher of the Peace. 5. 13 10. Ambulanthon ductor. Leader of the Fieldwalks. 5. 14 11. Sigillorum procurator &amp; productor. Overseer of the Sigillums. 5. 9 12. ?????????. Pilcorum monitor. Overseers of Gowns and Caps. 3. 15 The Court-Officers. Insignium ???? ???. Offic. Clas. Æt. 1. Ceremoniarum, Rituumq; Cristos, Ordinumq; Magister Urbanus. Master of Ceremonies. 2 15 2. Nequitiarum Regulus, five Atlas minor, Tyronumque patronus. Master of Misrule. 2 11 3. Caducifer, Fecialis Herincticus. Mace-bearer, and Herauld at Armes. 4 14 4. Amanucuses Rhetorici. The two Rhetoricall Text bearers, Aristotle on the right hand, quintilian the left. 5 10 5. Diademiser. The cap of Rhetoricall Maintenance. 5 15 6. Tyronum ?????. Master-Keeper of the Fresh-men. 3 15 Personæ personantes Orchestriews. 1. ?????????. Sir Shannulus The Parson, or Cap-loser. 3. 15 2. Merlita Chorista Merlins Chorister, or Fond Hope. 3. Eccho. Empty Fame. 5. 9 The Fresh-men and Sub-juniors of the 6. Forme. 1. Sir Antonio Draggle-gowne. 2. Sir Henrico Srudle-hawke. 3. Monsieur le Card-thummer. 4. Monsieur le Tittle-tattle. Monsieur le Incongruo. The Vestibulum, or Petty Tyrones. The Habit. The habit was uniform, pro more loci, ????? &amp; ???????, Gown and Cap, differing in the colour of the Phancy, quasi significator officii, the ensigne of office. Onely the Prince and six prime Seniors wore Beavers, to shew the priviledge of their long standing, with Brims also reverst, in token of freedome above the rest; and deckt with stars of severall magnitudes; having in their right hands Trunchions of severall colours, &amp; silk Bends ore their shoulders, Emblemata Honorum, Types of their calling. All white Gloves. white Pumps, Linnen Stockins, knots differing in colour. The Symbolicall Properties. 1. A Mercuriall Mace Argent. Caduceus, with two Snakes, interwinding, and plumed Argent. signifying the power of Serpentine eloquence. This is the Fexanima Pytho, insinuating perswasion. 2. A Mercuriall Bonnet, plumed Argent, Edged Or; typifiing the gallant rationall Head-piece, a Princely Presence; and a free-borne Speaker, whose braines are laid with Gold, and his tongue tipt with Silver. Aurum Argentum? Ioquitur. Againe, the Snakes have respect to the will, the Cap to the the Intellect, the wings to the fancy, and the Colours to the Passions. 3. A Scutchion or Mercuriall Sheild, which bore Gules, three Keyes, Or. on the dexter hand; but on the sinister, a Bend Azure charged with foure Stars of equall radii; over them Sol, under that a Cube, Triangle, and Circle, all Or. the Crest or Rose with wings Argent. quasi Rosa volans. Observe farther, that the allusion was Mathematicall, and chiefly Astronomicall, from beginning to the end, at thus: The two designes are as the Artick and Antartick Poles, bearing the Axis of the maine worke. The five Strophe, Antistropta, or Acts, doe bear the number and office of the Zones; the seven chiefe Seniors wander as the Planets through the Zodiack, the Planets proper stage; the twelve Sub-monitors, as the twelve Signes, fixt to the Zodiack, The intire number of Actors, the same with the Constellations; some Southerne, some Northerne moving, all according to their Longitude, latitudes, and altitudes, according to their place &amp; magnitudes, in the upper &amp; lower division of the School place. All in time and order of vicissitude, moving through the degrees of the Zodiack, till they have reacht to the ????, the highest pitch of Schoole Honour, viz. Princeps Rhetoricus, the Sol scholæ; ? ????? ????????, the Mercuriall Moderator of the whole Regiment; for it is Sceptrum successivum, in ordine admeritum Ascensionis. The Prologue two-fold: 1. The mock-Prologue. 2. And the Serious. 1. The first layes the contrivance of the Anti-plot or counter-designe: Vbi consulitur de inductione Pilei in Scenam &amp; Curiam Principis Rhetorici. The Contrivers five, Misrule, Corister, Custos pileorum, Ostiarius, and Monitor Scholæ. 2. The second gives the argument of the maine plot or fixt work in hand. Being two-fold. 1. In Greek Iambic, Ad Doctos. 2. Ad populum. In English. The English Prologue. All haile thrice faire Assembly. VVhat Orders, Laws, Rights, Constitutions, here Run yearly round in this Schoole Hemisphere: And what Our Elders, and Our Classes doe, Are this day tendred to your publique view. Our Prince is King of Bees; whose well-mann'd throne, No peevish VVaspe can clime, nor lazie drone. Under whose VERGE our new Atlantis lies, And comes well-neere th'Utopian Paradise. As for the scene that lies in Grecian-Rome, A piece new weaved ith Greek and Latian lome; Yet for your sakes (sweet Ladies) all along, The work's imbroder'd in our Mother Tongue. Sirs, you are wise, accept what is not ill, Who are not wise, let them do what they will. The expression of the Mercuriall Coat-Armour. 1. The Scutchion is also allusive every way; by the Plumed Rose in the Crest is declared, that fragrancy and celerity are the top-work of eloquence: swiftnesse, and sweetnesse, are the last and highest parts of this science: again, Invention must not drag low, language must fly high. 2. The 3 Golden Keys lay open this Conceipt; that Logick, Rhetorick, and Grammar, are by way of entrance, taught fundamentall in Schools; but the work is left to be crowned and matured in the Academies: therefore as we the 3 Keys, Oxford gives the 3 Crowns, which also decypher the 3 principall Sciences, 1. Theology, 2. Law, 3. Physick: And why may not we here have a Key for them also? 3. By the Cube, Arithmetick; by the Triangle, Geometry; by the Circle, Cosmography are here intended, and stand Quartered under the 4 Stars, as taught in a different place and manner from the other three Arts before. 4. The Bend of Stars with eight Radii, represent the prime 4 Seniors or Ministers, each man being Keeper of 8 distinct Laws or Canons; Himself shining amongst his fellows as a Star in his place: Again, these Stars denote the 4 cardinall qualities here (under this Prince) professed, attained, kept, 1. Language, 2. Invention, 3. Manners, 4. Religion, each consisting of eight severall branches, cleare and starlike. 5. The Sun hath the chief influence, as the glory and light of the rest; ? ???????? ?????, and stands mounted in the highest angle above the bend of stars, locus Principis Rhetorici, the Princes place; but by the Sun is chiefly intended Religion, without which, all Arts are but meer darknesse, or at least, Ignis fatuus. Yet our Sol appears quartered in a sinister side, because the Pulpits doth challenge the upper hand of the Schools, and Theology the wall of Phisologie. But if the Parson at any time shall lose his Cap, and turn Tityre tu patulæ, a Coridon of our Arcadia; then will we Quarter our Sol upon the right, and his Cap upon the left; for then he is our Junior: his Sheep-hook hath done Homage to our Rod; Divinity hath struck Top sayle to Grammar, and the Liturgy in Syntancticall obeysance hath vayled his bonnet to the Accidence. 6. The two fields, Gules on the right hand, Azure on the left in a Philosophicall acception lively depaint the Will and the Wit, the Heart and the Brain, the two fixt seats of our fourfold learning. Thus much for the Blazounrie in brief, Sed aliquid latet, quod non patet, qui nucleum vult nacem frangat. And now we come to the Argument in speciall, and Correlative to each Act. Princeps Rhetoricus, The schoole Captaine. But why Princeps, and why Rhetoricus? that fals in next to be scand, for non est in promptu ubique O Edipus, all teeth are not nut-crackers. Therefore observe, that the whole allusion brancheth it self into five strains of Rhetorick, or Acts Oratoricall distringued here by 5 titles: The first Act we call Inauguratio, the Instalment, The second, Pompa, the Entertainment. The third, Criticus, the Linguist. The fourth, the Disputant. The fifth, the Judge or Moderator. Princeps. And in order to these is personated a Prince thus qualified: In the first, Princeps legitime inauguratus. In the second, Princeps Pompaticus. Third, Philologicus. Fourth, Philosophicus. Fifth, Judicialis. And in the Catastrophe of the scene, Princeps Religiosus: and through the whole Acts, Princeps Heroicè moratus: of noble deportment; alluding to the seven fold buckler of Ajax, under which Ulysses lay protected. Homers Prince of Eloquence: and thus much for our Prince, Quatenùs Princeps: invested with Title, Authority, Quality; now view him quatenus Rhetoricus. Rhetoricis. His Prince-part was a notion assumed, faigned, and allegorically borrowed: but the Rhetorick part and title are in earnest, &amp; (ex professo) opus loci &amp; Personæ. For now One was to make good in himself (by way of president to the rest) the Character of a compleat Rhetorician, and that by the exact Test of our two Rhetoricall Text-men, Aristotle and Quintilian: for one while he cunningly insinuates; as at his first Ascent to the Chaire. Detur, ait, Dignori, ego enim (comparative) non merui. Like Cæsar in Tacitus, waving finely his new imposed dignity; and yet at the same instant, policetur abundè, promiseth mountains, to rule like an Angel. Again, sometimes his speech becomes demonstrative, praising and inveigling: sometimes deliberative, pondering the future good: sometime Juciciall; according as the Lost-Cap finds Argument through the five Acts, occasionally, &amp; ex Ansâ datâ: for still the matter is before the Iudge, corim Judice lis. And still the Parsons Cap makes work for all. Argumantativè. Then next, touching those three Aristotelian Requisites, 1. Natura, 2. Art, 3. Exercitatio. they were better there seen, then here spoken. As candid spectability, a Tongue well hung, firm sides, retentive memory, fancy clear, a princely undanted presence, &amp; cujus ex ore melle dulcior stuebat Oratio, &amp;c. But to compleat the matter, after some faire Essayes of 1. Invention, 2. Disposition, 3. Elocution, and 4. Pronunciation, he falls upon the moderating part of Oratory; and exhibits a Rhetoricall skill in the Bee-like use of Authours, culling out for his own Hive, the flowers inservient to his present purpose, mutatis mutaadis 3 tèr, i.e. Alterum, Alteratum, or Aliud. Sometimes again he leaves moderating, and falls to debating, syllogysticè, upon the Argument, till being victor in the truth, he concludes by a double power, Argumento 1. recti. 2. sceptri. And so becomes in fine, both Princeps and Rhetoricus, co-incident in nature and title, the Rhetoricall Princesse: for, in vero conveniunt Rex &amp; lex. The Arguments of the 5 Acts severally and particularly; and these in twofold notion, 1. Historical. 2. Morall. ACT I. Princeps legitimè inauguratus, or, The Instalment. The Argument Historicall. Scena I. A curtain is displaied, ?????????, the prime School monitor appears in a studying posture: is interrupted by the entrance of the 2 Text-bearers, inducing ?????????, the wandring schollar Lose-Cap to the sight and speech of the Monitor, with a Petition tendered de recuperando Parsonuli Pileo, for recovery of his Cap, defunct; the Petition is accepted by Phylophylax the Monitor; with promise to be presented in Court, and to have fair audience in the businesse (for his Office is not only School-Superintendent, but also libellorum custos, Master of request and complaints) And here is the first stone laid in the Arch-fabrick of the counterplot. Scena II. Lord of mis-rule enters with his bonny fresh men, undertakes their protection, contra gentes &amp; jura; and against the imperious wand of Custos Tyronum, his main Antagonist and theirs. And this is the second trick of wit in the crosse plot, so to disturb the main plot. Scen. III. Here the maine plot begins. The Master of Ceremonies appears with the Keeper of the Fresh-men: Tis consulted De Curiâ rectè curandâ, that things be done in Place, Time and Order. Exit Ceremonius. Custos induces his Fresh charge, pearcheth them up at the Bar: succeeds again Ceremonius with his whole Court-traine. And first, marshalleth his fourth Classis, next his fift; then fall in the Officers, Seniors, Attendants, Prince, in ceremoniall order. Ceremonius leads the way, next him, Lord Misrule, then two Monitors abrest. Singly succeeds them Monitor Monitorum; next, Præco Fecialis, the Mercuriall Herauld at Armes, Princeps Rhetoricus in the midst. After him the two Text-bearers; then the other two Monitors abrest, the Cap of Maintenance after them, and last, Custos Tyronum, Proclaimer and Guards-man Generall. They proceed to Election, on a fourefold Ground; 1. Sucession, 2. Merit, 3. Suffrages, 4. Lawes and Customes. Invenitur Caduceo Habilis &amp; Idoneus, proclaimed fit for the Mercuriall Scepter. The Quæries are ten: As first, whether he hath orderly ascended from Classis to Classis, non faciens saltum, not making a skip. 2. Whether he be patiens inediæ, frigoris, &amp; sudoris. An multa tulit, fecitq; sudavit &amp; alsit: whether he be Snow-proofe, able to endure Heats and Colds, and to watch by the Lamp of Cleanthes. Againe, whether he hath learned obedire &amp; imperare, to obey and command, as Junior and Senior; and whether well verst in the Lawes appertaining to the Chaire Mercuriall: whether bene moratus, Bene linguatus, Religiosus, &amp; Humilis. And being approved by the Register generall, proclaimed Prince by the Herauld, and voiced by the rest, he ascends the Chaire of Eloquence. Then followes the citement of Officers; after that, the Canto or Hymne of Congratulation; the Speeches Encomiasticall ad Principem. After the Citement, the Indictment is read against the Tyroes, whose penalties are imposed in way of severall Theames, and liberty to speak for themselves, par pœnæ culpa. Their Patron is Lord of mis-rule. Scen. IV. Ex Improviso, abruptly breaks in Sir Shone, Molestus Interpellator Curiæ, In a great fume, impatient of longer attendance, a blunt, unbred, rude, insulse Scholar, and as roughly entertain'd by the Guards-man: they chop Logick at staves end dilemmatically; Here I can have ye, &amp; there; but pates find mediums. Master Keeper assaints the Parson, Argumento Baculino, with Halberd Eloquence, the Parson indoctrinates the Keeper with Crab-tree Logick, but is foyled at his owne weapon; till Misrule, and the Schoole-monitor, his Fratres fraterrimi, complotters and sworn partners, step in to his rescue; by whose provision and request, his Petition is heard, registred, and deliberated on, but deferred till the next Court Sessions Mercuriall. ? ?????. Ode Acclamatoria. The Congratulatory Canto. ??????? ???????????? ????? ??????????? ?????, ????? ????? ????? ?????????? ???????, ??????????? ???????. ??? ??????? ?? ? ????, ?????????? ??? ? ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????. The humble Partishon of Sir Shone of Wales, in formâ paperis following. Be it knowne to all and some, that her hath a partishon in her pockets, ad hunc venarabiliem collegium, propter facere Hue and Cry, post cappum sumum (misere defunctum, &amp; lostum) per omnes Chamberos, Studies, &amp; Corneros. And also her desires to enter her Actions, or rather her Passions in te Law, for a stire facias through te six mercuriall classes, with a non est Inventus, as touching her Plieus; and a Quare Latitat, amongst all her cozen Scholers, and her shall be pound to pray, for her six venerable said Monitors while her may, for ever and a day, and longer too, when her hath nothing else to do. The Morall Argument of this Act, for want of roome, wee passe by. The Authors, like so many flourie fields, Campi Rhetorici, were Tacitus, Justine, Justinian, Quintilian, Eutopia, Mori, Atlantis Verulamei, Apuleius: The Greeks, Homer, Aristophanes, Plutarch, Zenophon de Cyropædia, Longinus, [illeg.]????????. Aristotles Rhetorick, Plato, Æschylus, &amp;c. The language chiefly Greek; but Auditorii gratiâ, translated here and there into English. ACT. II. Princeps Pompaticus: or, The Entertainment. The Argument Historicall. Atlas minor, alias Misrule, ascends his Astronomical Cabinet. A Scematicall figure is erected at the command of the Prince de pileo restaurando. His censure upon Astrologie. This course failing, by the consent of the Court, a Hue and Cry is voiced. Sir Shone the Proclaimer. An Eccho answers within; he runs in after the Eccho, his supposed countriman: in stead of him, fals upon Merlins Chorister, the old welch Bard; who by the Harmonious power of his voice, summons in (in three severall dances) 18 Caps distinct. The Song between Chorister and Eccho. Choris. Eccho, O Eccho; thou Oracle, O Eccho, Eccho tel. Eccho. What shall the Eccho, Eccho tell? Choris. The Scholars Cap is lost, how shal't be found? Eccho. Charm Atlas, Charme the Caps from under ground; By six and six, so shall the Cap be found. Choris. Caps all, O Caps all, appeare at Ecchoes call, Sir great, six small. Eccho. Here, here we rise at Ecchoes call. Choris. When you the Viols heare, brave Sprights appeare. Eccho. Sound Viols sound, for at your sound we'l venter. Roome, roome for Caps, by six and six we enter. The first Dance, consisting of the six Grammaticall Persons. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. I. Thou. He. We. Ye. They. After the Dance they impeach each other De furto Pilei. I puts it off to Thou, Thou to He, so the rest alternative; but neither I, Thou, nor He, We, Ye, nor They: Ergo tandem Nemo, Nemo is the man, No body has it. Morally alluding to the depraved nature of children; accusing and excusing; peevish lyars: the Tutors taske to cure. And also implies, that men themselves act the Childrens Scean; Instead of vindicating, often recriminating, waspish, serpentine, childish, saying, unsaying, gain-saying. Quis enim non ab Ovo mendax? And thirdly, it alludes to the Academians contradictory humour, Affirmo, Nego. The second Dance consisted of six Gipsies, Cap-men, of severall Colours. The intent of this, was like the other, but in a higher way. Suggere jam Quintiliane Colorem; every man hath some colour for what he sayes, or does; in a severall cast of naturall Rhetorick. But by these colours is primely intended the principles and depth of mysticall Philosophie: in which the idle Scholars Cap is seldome found. The third Dance was of the chiefe Faculties, personated lively. 1 A Cardinall. A Miter. Signifying Degrees of preferment. 2 A Master of Arts Square Cap. Signifying Degrees of Learning. 3 The Falkner. Montero Signifying Degrees of Gentry. 4 Seaman. Saylors Thrum. Signifying Degrees of travell. &amp; Forrain. 5 Souldier. An Helmet. Signifying Degrees of Martial Officers. 6 Smith. Fuddle-cap. Signifying Degrees of Trades. Morall. Thus every Cap what ere it be, Is still a sign of some degree. The Dance ends merily. Lose-Cap breaks his confining Circle, and chops in among the Caps, dancing; is defended from their Battouns by the Souldiers buckler, and carried away upon his shoulders; the Seamen advancing one leg, fuddle-Cap the other, shooing him in the exit. The sum of the intendment, belongs to oratoricall practice; these 6 be subjects of eloquence; work for a wise head, and a winning tongue. A sight proposed to the Prince, what manner of men he has to deal with; that will be great or wise. Scena II. After that all vanish and nothing effected, Atlas demands further of the Merlins Chorister whats to be done. He answers again in Song. Cho. Eccho, O Eccho, for Merlins sake O Eccho, once more tell, Eccho. What shall the Eccho once more tell? Cho. Tell who the Cap doth weare, and who goes clear, Eccho. No figure cast by Spel, or Charm, or Magick: But Scholar-like, by Grammar, Wit, and Logick. Atlas interprets the Oracle, the Prince likes and consents; and commands a preparation Scholasticall, de Pilei disquisitione Etymologica. ACT. III. Princep Rhetoricus, or Criticus the Linguist. The Argument. The Philogicall Books are fetcht forth from the Trino-Musæum; the Triple Library, 1. Grammaticall, 2. Philosophicall, 3. Mathematicall; the Grammarians are first scann'd; then the Glossaries &amp; Dictionaries, then the Declamers ex tempore deliver their Cap-verdit Etymologically. The Prince in his Chair moderating; Monitor scholæ, and two head Monitors maintaining the Table in the middle, the other two at Desks ex opposite, and Formes ex adverso to Forms. This way also proving invalid, command is given by his Highnesse elegance; for an Academicall Certamen, logically controverted. Exeunt omnes. ACT. IV. Princeps Academicus, or, The Disputant. The Authours scientificall, and in order to the 7 Arts are produced. Then a set dispute between the three main sciences; de melioritate Prærogativâ Pilei; the question is stated two waies, 1. Which is guilty of the Parsons Cap. 2. Which most worthy among themselves of the three: Next intervenes a Question between the two Princes, Rhetorick and Misrule, de prioritate Galeri &amp; Pilei, the preheminence of the Hat and the Cap; but while the disputes grew hot, enters a message from the Cantabrigian Fellow-Commoners, desiring of the Court a conference touching the new lost Cap, as a maine case concerning their Coppy-hold, 'Tis condescended to, and the Court dissolves for the present. ACT. V. Princeps Judicialis, or, The Judge. Here is a set form of a Sessions, a Court of Judicature, more Judiciali. The Tyroes declame: the Theams five, 1. Horn-book, 2. the Hawke, 3. Long Tayle, 4. Knave of Clubs, 5. A Noune is the Name of a Thing. Before the Declamation each fresh Declamer takes his Briny Dos of water and salt; from the hand of the Tyro-guardian: at every stand, or dead lift, they are helpt out, by their Suggester, and nimble-tongu'd Patron Monsieur de la Misrule; and at last by his mediation, Annuit Princeps, the Bils of Indictment are expunged; Et donantur Pileo Tyrones: made free of the Colledge. Exit Misrule. Misrule within sends Message to the Monitor Monitorum; He craves excuse for his absence a while; A flourish of Cornets. Forthwith return in form of a pontificall Train the 5 Counter-plotters; Misrule in the midst as a Prince; and the Schollars Cap advanced upon a Trunchion, more triumphali: He is made to give account of his device, that no offence be given or taken; and after some Questions problematically propounded by the Prince; He and his seniors are invited to an Astronomicall dance in reference to the Planets, with Laurels, each bearing a star advanced frontwise. After this the Prince returns to his Chaire, gives his charge to the Tyrones, Juniors, and Seniors in their turns, concluding that Religion is the finis ultimatus, the ultimate End of all our Sudies; and Humility the last work of Religion, ending with this Motto, Quanto doctior, tanto submission; withall couching briefly in a fourfold distinction, the four Ends of all mens Academicall labours, 1. Mechanicall, ditescere, 2. Sophisticall, clarescere, 3. Philosophicall, cognoscere, and 4. Angelicall, videre Deum, i.e. Practicws, se abnegando. The Questions in this Act accidently emergent were these. 1. Whether the Mercuriall Cap be more injured by the Fathers indulgence, the Sons negligence, or the Masters insufficience? 2. Whether a lying humour be rather suckt from the dugs of the Nurse; or the paps of custome, or rather, An mendacium be extraduce? Hereditary? 3. Whether the Parsons Cap hath received more cuts and blows, from the blunt weapons of Bacchus, or the sharp sword of Mars? 4. Whether a wel-bred Rhetorician did ever want a Mocenas, or his Cap mendicant? 5. Whether every Noble and great Gentlemen ought to be princeps Rhetoricus, a prime good speaker? 6. Whether every Master of Arts be princeps Rhet. Et e contra? 7. Whether the greatest enemy to the Cap, be not the Cap? Science against Science more persecuting then Ignorance? 8. An pileum Sir-Shonnuli fit ex Lana Caprina? 9. An fiat Pileorum transmigratio? 10. Pileus An tandem fataliter— —Exeat omnis?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUS. As soon as the Court-scene closed, and had as it were bid good-night to Action and Invention, Prince-Misrule-Atlas (now left singly on the Stage) presents the Audience with a Caution or two, by the Horarie Advise of his Quadrant: which being elevated to a just height, he calculates the howrs of the day, 3 of clock, 33 min. and 3 digits. Then warns them, Maturare Reditum, imminet ursa; to hasten homewards, lest ????????? the Keeper of the great Bear meet with them after All. The Beare being a starting-enemy to the Coach-Horse; and Twilight a dangerous time for Caps. Venit Hesperus ite. So Atlas bids his Star-like Guests Adieu, As you have shin'd on Us this Day, With friendly Infùence: So may The New year shine on You. E fonte Cambrino, Jan. 19. 1648. FINIS.</field>
