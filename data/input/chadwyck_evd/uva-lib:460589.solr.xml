      <field name="fulltext">THE DUKE D'ORMOND A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. THE Tragedy which is contained in the following volume was written twenty-four years ago, though it has since undergone many alterations. The Author mentions this circumstance, because, in many respects, it is not such a performance as, at his present time of life, he would have written. The candid reader must be the judge whether he has been too much influenced by that partiality which all writers, more or less, feel for their own productions, when he has deemed that it is not altogether unworthy of being presented to the public. The Author can truly say, that he sees many imperfections in it; he even questions whether the turn of his mind, which rather leads him to analyze feelings, than to clothe them with the freshness, or to embody them in the flesh and blood vitality, of dramatic composition, does not utterly disqualify him for this species of writing. The Author would just hint that where expectations of success are so doubtful, and where a consciousness of demerit is so deeply felt, even if he should not be deemed to have succeeded, he hopes that no great disgrace would attend such a failure. With regard to the other Poem in this volume, the Author presents the reader with one more tale, a part of whose outline is taken from the Novels of Boccacio, notwithstanding the accusation of the monthly reviewers, that he has attempted to imitate, and failed in the attempt, the mixture of pathos and humour of the Italian writers. It is rather singular that in one of the poems, “Titus and Gisippus,” with regard to which this assertion is made, not one instance of, or even the most remote approach to, an attempt at the humorous can be found; notwithstanding the said reviewers so facetiously remark, in reply to the allegation of the Author that this is the case, that they have heard of persons doing many things unconsciously, but never before heard of a person being humorous without being aware of it. Whatever be the Author's failings as a writer (and he is willing to submit to the imputation of many), this one, he is sure, cannot attach to him, the sin of imitation. If he write at all, it is not so much from premeditation and design, as in obedience to an impulse which it would be painful to resist.—The Author has partially availed himself in his printed poems of the outline of two stories from Boccacio, not being blessed with a genius very fertile in the invention of incidents; but these were merely pegs, as it were, to which he wished to attach his own feelings. He never dreamed of imitating the style of the Italian authors, any more than Shakspeare may be supposed to have done (a genius with whom the Author would never think of comparing himself, except on those points which are common to all human beings) when he framed, as the Author presumes that he did, his two plays of “Cymbeline,” and “All's Well that Ends Well,” from the tales of Boccacio. Many very excellent persons disapprove altogether of performances in which portraitures of the passions are introduced. The Author therefore briefly, and not without a jealousy over himself lest he should be in the wrong, while he is sensible that his opinion combats that of the more respectable part of the community, here ventures to state his ideas on the subject.—It is certain, whether impassioned delineations exist in books or not, that there will be what are called impassioned characters. They are these characters which produce and like these books, not these books which encourage, much less produce, these characters. None but these would relish works of the description to which the Author has been alluding; and he is constrained to suggest, that, in general, he believes the prejudice which is entertained against impassioned performances arises from the fact, that, in the breast of the greater part of readers, they excite a painful sense of their own deficiency as respects the scope and intensity of their feelings. Sooner, therefore than avow their own defect, they will erect a negation of passion into a positive virtue. On the other hand, the Author has known persons who have blended exquisite sensibility with deep early religious impressions, and who also have been much limited and restricted in their course of reading and social intercourse, who have found on taking up works of an impassioned tendency, that they too violently stimulated their minds, and destroyed that equanimity and composure, to secure which ought to be one of the first objects of the religious and devout. Of course the Author would never try to persuade persons on whom such performances thus operate to turn to them; no—he respects too much the innate purity, and the exquisite moral and religious tact of such characters, to wish to dim the one, or to blunt the other. But to the generality of those who complain of illegitimate influence from such works, the Author thinks that he may with justice reply in the language of Rousseau in answer to a similar allegation brought against his performances, “Que celle qui lira celui ci, malgré son titre, ne se plaigne point du mal qu'il lui aura fait; elle ment. Le mal etoit fait d'avance: elle n'a plus rien a risquer.”—For one person that objects to books of an impassioned tendency from an exquisite nicety and impressibility of temperament, there are many, many indeed, who only do it as a screen for their own coldness; or to speak perhaps more correctly, as well as more liberally, from a sort of instinctive dislike to the portraiture of feelings to which no corresponding chord vibrates in their bosoms. The main objection, the Author conceives, which can be made against impassioned works is the following. Not only no person would either read them or write them while under the impression of religious feeling, but also a taste for them and a taste for religion could not co-exist in the same mind. Is this true? If it be, not a word would the Author of the following performance say in their extenuation. But in his opinion, if, by really religious persons, neutral pursuits may be at all tolerated, pursuits which are neither religious nor irreligious, and whose only recommendation is that they exercise the intellectual faculties (such subjects for instance as those of science, history, and the greater part of those which form the basis of poetry), works in which the passions are delineated may also lay claim to the same toleration. Of course the Author entirely excludes either from toleration, or from the compass of this apology, those works which pourtray the passions in an inflammatory or seductive manner. Who was ever made ambitious by reading Macbeth, or King Richard the Third; jealous by reading Othello; and died a martyr to the frenzies of imagination, or to the fervours of love, from the perusal of Hamlet or of Romeo and Juliet?—and who of an intellectual cast, who had read these tragedies, would wish not to have been introduced to such exquisite delineations of the workings of the human mind? On the other hand, having premised that there will be persons of an impassioned cast, whether or not there be literary performances adapted to their character, the Author affirms that such persons, in an excited state of mind, will not, cannot find an interest in matter-of-fact books, or books of science; he further thinks that the perusal of works adapted (of course in no way offensive to the interests of morality) to the above excited state of mind, instead of augmenting that excitement, often, as it were, rather absorbs the redundant sparks of passion which are ready to fly off in all directions, and which not only o'erinform, but absolutely disease the mind Preface to Isabel, a tale by C. Lloyd, p. 28.“In the opinion of the Author, books develope, never create; they are only relished in proportion as they reflect back what they already find in the mind; they modify the previous impressions, they seldom afford new materials for excitement.” Ditto, p. 33.“The Author has seen in many religious families from which books of imagination were very much excluded, the same intellectual ennui, the same indisposition, and incapacity for receiving excitement from ordinary reading which by the superficial is supposed to be an effect produced exclusively by the habit of perusing works of an impassioned and exciting cast. The Author allows that many of these works have a most pernicious tendency; yet he believes that the worst books are a very inefficient part of the causes of vice in any given character; books are resorted to in states of meditation, and not in states of active impulse; and it is in the latter state chiefly, when strong impressions happen to be made upon it, that the character is irrevocably formed.”— The Author himself thinks, that he has found when his mind has been in an excited and restless state, that the perusal of a book which has described a similar one, so far from acting as a stimulus, has rather operated as a sedative; the matter of the book has neutralized the exacerbations of his spirit; has absorbed its redundancies; and from such an employment he has often arisen refreshed and tranquillized, when had he attempted to seek refreshment or tranquillity from some author whose topics were one shade more remote from his then state of mind, than the one in question happened to be, he either would have turned from it in disgust, or would have found it incompetent to fix his attention.— Preface to Isabel, p. 28, 29.“Books,” as we have said before, “modify the previous impressions; they seldom afford new materials of excitement. If this remark be just, the objection to impassioned works falls at once. The impassioned, if deprived of them, will only be impassioned in a more dangerous way, because with less of intellectual association; the unimpassioned are always secured from their influence, by the texture of their minds, and by the contempt which they affect, or feel, for them.” Besides, to sum up all which can be said on this subject in one phrase, is it not better to educate, than to endeavour to annihilate the passions?—there are many even of perilous natures who might be conciliated by the former process—how many are there that are driven to desperation, and goaded, as it were, to an inseparable distance from the virtuous, between whom and themselves an impassable gulph seems to yawn, by the latter! The Author can scarcely forbear adding, that it was not till the following Tragedy had gone through the press to nearly the middle of the fourth act, that it struck him that the feelings of some of his more serious friends might be hurt by it. Under this impression he would gladly have cancelled it, had not the expence attending such a change, and the pledge given to the publisher of the following work as to its contents, been the source of considerations which weighed upon him on the other hand. The Author knows that we are commanded by Apostolic authority not to Romans, chap xiv. v. 13, 21.“put a stumbling block in a brother's way,” nor to do “any thing” whereby a “brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak;” and he can truly say, that, had it occurred to him before the contents of this volume were sent to the press, that any portion of them had such a tendency, he would at once have consigned them to oblivion, even though had he thought far more highly than he now thinks of them in a literary point of view: and now that, too late to effect any change, except by means of an inconvenience which seems fraught with greater evil than can be produced by suffering that which is already printed to remain, the idea has been suggested to him that such offence might be taken at some parts of the following Tragedy, all that the Author can say is, to produce such an impression was so far from forming any part of his object in publishing it, that in as much as such an impression is produced he shall have to regret that he was inadvertent of the possibility of such a consequence till it was too late to avoid it. There are many ways in which probably this Tragedy might be altered for the better, particularly in the fifth act. Some final destination ought perhaps to be assigned to Courtenaye and Despard; and indeed the Author had added a scene, which would have lengthened the present Tragedy, in which something of this kind was attempted, but he felt as if the catastrophe at the end of the first scene of the fifth act closed the interest of the piece, and any further detail, and amplification of its denouement would but weaken and attenuate it. Besides, to speak the truth, the identity is passed from the Author which led to the composition of this piece; all attempts from him to alter it would be but so much patch-work. It is better that a composition should be defective from curtailment, than enfeebled by too much detail; in a former part of this preface, the Author has said, “if he write at all, that he must write in obedience to an impulse which it would be painful to resist, rather than from premeditation and design,” and not only the reverse of all this, but also to write in absolute opposition to inclination and impulse, would be his predicament, were he to attempt to add to this jeu d'esprit of former years. The Author hopes that it is supererogatory to intimate that the defence of duelling in the second scene of the fourth act of this Tragedy is merely inserted as characteristic of the personage into whose mouth it is put, and not the expression of his own sentiments. Besides it is but a relative and comparative defence: it is not there pretended that the practice is good in itself, but only better than something which has been introduced in its place; it is not spoken of as a commendable thing, but as a lesser evil. Woodfield, May 16, 1822.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. TILL the following Tragedy had gone through the press to page 192, it did not occur to the Author to contrive that the Duke D'Ormond and the Marchioness de Mielcour should be married. The former arrangement was painful to the Author for reasons that need not be mentioned, but it was not till such a progress as he has already stated had been made in the printing of the Tragedy, that any feasible plan of altering the plot occurred to him. To make the Duke D'Ormond propose marriage after such a recent attachment as he is represented to have had, and with such positive engagements, to another, would give an air of deliberate treachery to his character, which is inconsistent with the view which the Author wishes the reader to take of it; to make Courtenaye propose such a step would be in the highest degree unnatural, and inconsistent with the furtherance of all his schemes; nothing therefore remained but a spurious marriage, which Courtenaye hypocritically recommends. It is natural to suppose that the first idea of this suggested itself to Courtenaye about the time that the soliloquy takes place in the third act, page 169, and the Author requests that the reader will be kind enough, after the perusal of the first line of the above-mentioned page, to insert the following addition:— To-night,—Duke D'Ormond's feelings, as I know, Are ripe for this,—to-night, yes, yes, this night,— Shall they be joined in ties irrevocable. The appearance of this lady, first to me This scheme suggested. Yes, he shall not see her, Till he have placed between himself and her A barrier insurmountable. I meant But by a snare of gallantry t'entrap him. From this he may escape. But if they be Married,—ah married! Then such sanctity The law, his conscience, and the prejudice Of all conditions to this tie attach, Ah then, in vain will this his earliest mistress, So opportunely at this instant found, E'en though she be a kneeling suppliant, plead For a renewal of his love. I see It all. I'll to a priest, now I have done With Despard. To the yielding Marchioness Then will I hasten with the holy man: And since I know they're ripe for any scheme That gives a pledge of permanence to their passion, E'en while the iron's hot,—I'll strike the blow!— And, ere the day be passed, I'll so frame things They shall be bound in everlasting ties. In act the third, page 158, the scene between Despard and Courtenaye should be supposed to take place at the House of the former, and not at the Hotel of the Marchioness de Mielcour. The mistake of the present arrangement originated in the omission of a scene between that in which the Marchioness and Courtenaye, and that in which the latter and Despard meet, and the forgetting to adjust the minor mechanism of the piece to that omission. Courtenaye should go to the house of Despard, and not Despard come to that of the Marchioness, and the reader is requested to make this imaginary transfer in the perusal of the Tragedy.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">[FIRST ACT.] SCENE THE FIRST. A banqueting room. Table spread with a dessert; bottles, glasses, &amp;c. Courtenaye, Despard, Doricourt, and De Valville, afterwards the Duke D'Ormond. DORICOURT. WHAT a changed man is D'Ormond! COURTENAYE. Changed? What mean you? DE VALVILLE. It is most easy to conceive his meaning. COURTENAYE. That which my duller faculties conceive not, To your more quick ones may be obvious. DORICOURT. Well acted, on my life! Why, Courtenaye, how When pupil to so finished an instructor, Should D'Ormond not be changed? COURTENAYE. Good gentlemen, I do not quite conceive your aim. DE VALVILLE. “Not quite!” By this “not quite” you only mean to say, That you somewhat too pointedly conceive it. COURTENAYE. A truce with such equivocating phrase: Explain. DORICOURT. Aye freely! When Duke D'Ormond first Came hither, his deportment was most solemn, His air was more unbending and mysterious, Than that of any man I e'er conversed with. If to a jest you utterance gave, he must With metaphysic argument reply to't. Was there a hint of raillery on our part, 'Twas followed up on his with a discussion In formal terms, all marshalled as a corps Of engineers, storming a garrison. Were he new garmented, it cost his friends A hundred theories on the blest exemption Of Paradise, from all disguise of art. And this or that costume, as learnedly Discussed he, as he were fit nomenclature Adapting to some new discovered science. Not without syllogism could he eat; Drink sans hypothesis; or e'en make love Till he had weigh'd the motives on each side, Eked out with speculative subtleties From free-will, and necessity derived, “Fixed fate, free-will, fore-knowledge absolute.” DE VALVILLE. What is he now? Good heaven! why Paris has not A more accomplished cavalier than he! Who is arrayed with most magnificence?— 'Tis he. Who in his public exhibition Supports most pomp of train and equipage?— Still he. Who, in the most elaborate style, Gives banquets, such as might make pale with envy Apicius or Lucullus?—Still 'tis he!— Of these things now,—not “reasoning their need,” But frankly, carelessly, with easy air,— He does acquit himself. He now can feed Without declaiming that, for man's delight Since bodily appetites as much were given As highest instincts, 'tis deserving praise In the same sense,—though lower in degree, The same in kind,—to have a nice discernment In a fricandeau, as to be possessed Of pious and benevolent desires. Without discoursing of the immortal thirst Of spirits, he the goblet now can drain: And like a sparkling eye, or pouting lip, Nor of inevitable sympathies, Or appetence, pedantically prate.— —And who has taught him this? DORICOURT. Aye, who has taught him? COURTENAYE. I cannot say, I see the change you speak of. At least to-day he gave no proof of it, Or ere he parted hence. Seemed he not, sirs, Most splenetic and unconversible? DORICOURT. Granted.—Yes, if his manners of to-day Were specimen of that which he is always, I should agree with you; but my remarks To his more prevalent mood of late referred. DESPARD (aside to Doricourt and De Valville). Drop you this theme! You see in Courtenaye's breast It jars some secret string. COURTENAYE. Here D'Ormond comes. (To D'Ormond as he enters). Where, in the name of all the cheersome spirits, Which love to hover o'er the social board Free hearted mirth inspiring, have you been Thus truant from your friends? I did suspect That you designed to play the recreant part Of treacherous and unwarning absentee For the remaining hours 'twixt this and night. DUKE D'ORMOND. 'Twas not my aim. A cursed, officious priest, Would speak with me; and here perhaps had kept me Till morrow's dawn, had I not had the plea Of your expectance to cut short his prate. COURTENAYE. Thou hast trespassed, hast thou, in thy nightly rounds Warm from our festal orgies, o'er the threshold, Or by a ladder of ropes more likely scaled The wall, of monastery consecrate To female chastity? The priest, I'll warrant, Held not such tedious parley for light cause. Was she of rank? Father, or brother, has she To vindicate her honour? But what needs he, Who claims the “The Tabouret.” An honour so called, of sitting in the royal presence, peculiar in France to those of ducal rank. Thus Crebillon says of a Duke (Œuvres de Crebillon, fils, tome ii. p. 179) “Qui'l ne lui reste plus a vendre que son Tabouret.” Tabouret to heed such trifles? DUKE D'ORMOND. Hold thy licentious tongue! I was detained, But by a cause of interest more profound, Than suits this moment's utterance. COURTENAYE (aside). This to me May be of mighty import. I must probe him; But now is not the time. (To Duke D'Ormond). Whate'er the cause That robbed us of your presence, I assure you, You were detained much longer than we wished. This moment we were talking of you. DUKE D'ORMOND. Were you? Better had I absent myself once more. To-day all mirth is jarring to my spirits. I may afford you daintier amusement By opportunity of talking of me, Than by conversing with me. (To Courtenaye). You excel In subjecting your dear friends' characters, I know it, to the anatomizing edge Of subtle scrutiny. I baulk your hearers. COURTENAYE. Duke, you are splenetic. Sit down, I pray you, Remember the round dozen of champaigne You pledged to me, and forfeited last night. Let these contribute to this evening's mirth. DUKE D'ORMOND. Agreed. ALL. Agreed. [At a signal given, the table is supplied with fresh wine. Each of the party, except the Duke, here exchange significant looks.] COURTENAYE (aside to Despard). Note well his countenance. (Addressing the company). Come, let me season, with the name of one,— Whose voice, compared with it, to discord turns The most delicious melody, whose looks, To ugliness, most lovely forms,—the juice Which mantles in our goblets. Come, I say, I will invoke a beauteous patroness To grace,—far more than brighest saint, the shrine Most bright,—our mirth; her spirit to infuse, Though unseen, 'mid the pleasures of the hour. ALL (except the Duke). With all our hearts. COURTENAYE. The Marchioness de Mielcour. And may she find a heart as warm and true, As peerless and resistless are her charms. DUKE D'ORMOND, (Starting from his chair, and advancing to the front of the stage). The Marchioness de Mielcour! Curse the lips Which thus her name could recklessly profane! Shall it be used familiarly, nor I The oracle to dictate it? The means Shall it be made to give more pungent relish To midnight banquets, and inebriate revels? I cannot bear it! 'Tis all hell let loose To torture me to madness. COURTENAYE. Duke, did you Not hear the pledge? What agitates you thus? The Marchioness de Mielcour, I'll warrant, Likes the insuppressive fervour of a soul Fiery and ardent as this sparkling beverage! One that can revel in the ecstacy, When its rich fumes elicit from the brain, And thrilling blood, high phantasies of bliss, Far better than the sons of sentiment Sighing in sonnets, and quaint madrigals. DESPARD. Aye, by the holy rood, that does she, 'faith! And if you would that lady woo, and win, Badge of success, and emblem of your fealty, You must entwine the vine-leaf with the myrtle. DUKE D'ORMOND (aside). Hell and perdition! Must these wassailers Thus band about that name, and I not be The master spirit to controul their license? DESPARD, (Looking out of a window, opposite to which is a balcony, from the pillars of which are suspended lamps, and along which a young lady slowly paces to a carriage, in waiting for her, in the court of the banqueting-house, opposite to the end of the balcony). What have we here? A delicate creature, 'faith! Young, fresh, and fair! Alone, and unprotected! I'm off—there is no time for parleying here. [Vanishes suddenly through a porte-fenêtre which opens into the balcony.] DORICOURT. Where can that hair-brained Provençal be going? COURTENAYE. He is embarked in some love enterprize! His match he has not for a quick discernment Where skill in such adventures may be tried, Nor for possession of that skill when wanted. Woe to the damsel, if she virtuous be, Within his gripe! The lamb in eagle's talons Is not more sure a victim than is she! Except indeed, chusing to imitate The preux chevaliers of the good old times Of chivalry, we sally to a rescue. DUKE D'ORMOND. With all my heart! Let us be gone this instant! COURTENAYE. Fie, Duke, fie, fie! Would you a friend's sport spoil? I thought, that, by an intercourse with us, You were with better principles imbued. DUKE D'ORMOND (aside). Confound them, and their principles! I wish I knew as little of the first, as once I, of the latter knew! I can no more Endure this! Gentlemen, hold me excused. Elsewhere my presence is of urgent need. DESPARD. But see, six bottles yet remain unbroached. DUKE D'ORMOND. You broach them! Wine ne'er comes to you amiss. [Exit. COURTENAYE. Why, now—do you call this being so much changed? Was ever mortal more untractable Than he? What think you of his mood to-night? He's absolutely savage with the spleen: Ombrageux as a moody Englishman! DE VALVILLE. This so far does surpass all that I've seen Of his past humours, that it baffles quite All probable surmise. Or he's in love, Or vexed at heart by some untoward event. By whom, do you know, was he called from hence Some half hour since? I'll of our host enquire. [Rings. The master of the banqueting-house enters.] DE VALVILLE. That gentleman who now goes forth from hence, Who was it sought for him some half hour past? HOST. He was a priest: a friar mendicant. Le Charier he is called. COURTENAYE (aside). This solves at once The mystery! I will plot his ruin hence! He is dispatched to D'Ormond, as I've learned, On frequent embassies, by that lean foe To our good mother church, that hugenot, The canting Colville. 'Tis a shrewd discovery, And notably may work my purposes. DE VALVILLE. Who is this priest? This same Le Charier? Who? And what connection has he with Duke D'Ormond? COURTENAYE. 'Tis a long tale! too long now to be told! He is the emissary of a man Who was, in former times, the confidant Of an adventure of the amorous kind, That D'Ormond had in La Vendée, or ere He came to Paris. He would fain persuade him Faithful to be to his affianced love; If so, he is a lost man to ourselves. But I have hitherto successfully His projects contravened; nay more, contrived All intercourse to interrupt between them. The which with overtures to recommence, Le Charier by his patron is dispatched To D'Ormond, as I think. [Ruminating. This must not be! This visit of Le Charier's is portentous! D'Ormond, I track thy steps. (To Doricourt and De Valville). To you, good sirs, I presently return! Then let us pass, At least, some portion of the waning day In pastime meetest to refresh our spirits. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND ACT. SCENE THE FIRST. The House of Count Colville. Count Colville and Le Charier. COUNT COLVILLE. WHAT answer from Duke D'Ormond do you bring? LE CHARIER. Oh, the old tale! he will not hear reproof. His passions are in arms! 'Tis doubtless true, That, of the Marchioness de Mielcour, And him, which you have heard. COUNT COLVILLE. Would he not then One moment listen to you? LE CHARIER. Not one moment. COUNT COLVILLE. Would he not see me? LE CHARIER. No.—When first I gave Utterance to such a wish on your part, he Writhed like a thing tormented. COUNT COLVILLE. Wretched man!— What must be done for him? What I can, I will. But here the possible seems impotence!— But tell me what you gathered from him? LE CHARIER. When To him your apprehensions I expressed Of the ill consequence of intercourse With Courtenaye and his comrades, and when further, As you had authorized, nay had enjoined, I hinted at the rumour you had heard Of an arrangement 'twixt the Marchioness De Mielcour, and him, and then suggested The cruel consequence to Julia Villeneuve Of such an infidelity, he bit His lips, frowned sternly, stamped upon the ground, And quitting me abruptly, he pushed back The door with all his might, so that the room E'en shook; and thus without allowing me Time to expostulate, or his departure Gracing with any courteous ceremony, Finally disappeared. But I have now Another charge of which t'acquit myself: As I departed from the house, a servant Asked me if I came not from you. The truth Confessing, he informed me that a lady Then in the house, had questioned him of you, And wished to send to you a messenger. Then added, shewing me a letter, which He held, that she had begged him to take that With many charges of discreet conveyance, To your abode: he then went on to ask me,— As being burthened with variety Of hindrances, from doing this to-night; If I would be the bearer of it.—See,— Here is the letter, sir.— COUNT COLVILLE. To me, a letter!— And from a lady! In an unknown hand!— And yet methinks ere now I've seen that writing! What may its contents be? Sorrow in me Has made such ravages, in me, alas! Is such a constant inmate, with her pale Attendant apprehension, that I draw Inference calamitous, from each event That seems mysterious or extraordinary, And not of every day's anticipation. Well, I will open it, and put an end To these perplexed conjectures!— [Opens the letter. From Julia!— From the affianced bride of the Duke D'Ormond!— She tells me here that she is come to Paris: And further my permission she entreats To have brief interview with me! (To Le Charier.) But did You not say you received this at the house Where D'Ormond meets with his licentious friends? In short within the very threshold, where You erewhile met him? LE CHARIER. Yes, it is so. COUNT COLVILLE. Ah! Should they meet there. Well, if they do, I hope That Providence will turn the chance to good!— At all events I'll see her. Sit you down While briefly to her letter I reply.— [He sits down, writes. Folds and seals a letter, and gives it to a servant with an order to deliver it to Julia Villeneuve.] COUNT COLVILLE. What can she have to say to me? What can I say to her? Oh that I could, or ere I quit my native land, Duke D'Ormond see Released from his degenerate enthralment? To Julia reconciled!—And being one, As I have reason to believe, who well Deserves his love, e'en as he was or ere By vice degraded, that he might again Confer his love on her, and wedding her, With peace, and virtue, form a lasting union! I have myself from vice too deeply suffered, Not e'en to shudder, when its strong allurements, Enthral a heart susceptible of good!— I am not, Le Charier, the thing I seem!— LE CHARIER. So you have often told me; but I know not— You're always so consistent with yourself, Practice in you not only so makes good, But so outstrips profession—I confess, How to believe your self-disparagement.— COUNT COLVILLE. I am the thing I seem, and I am not!— You know I leave my native land: with me Time now is precious. Ere this lady come,— Since other opportunities may fail,— The few hours which I have to tarry here, Are with so many more affairs o'ercharged, Than I, with my enfeebled faculties, Can well dispatch,—I will now shew to you My inner self, if utterance meet be lent me. I am the thing I seem, and I am not!— Inasmuch as I am sincere I am; And inasmuch I am not as the times Discretion, place, person, and circumstance, Or would not suffer, or not authorize Me, to be unreservedly sincere.— But if you knew the pang it cost me, when I deviate the least from truth's plain path, My aberrations you would deem the effect Of circumstance, not offspring of my will. I have a heavy burthen at my heart!— Le Charier, divers are the characters Of human beings! Are there not who seem In early life for good predestinate Who by some fatal swerving of the will In perilous temptation, blast a prime Of happy promise: trees are they, which bear, Or ought to bear delicious fruit, which nipped By blighting east winds, sapless, withered, sered, And unproductive, finally become The leafless skeletons of what they were!— From men like these all joyous impulse flies; When they should act, they think, not having thought In past times ere they acted! Instinct dies In them, and scrutiny usurps its place. They see through all the common forms of things! They weigh; they speculate; they analyze!— In actions, which, to other men, seem good, And graceful, they, detecting but too well The prevalent motive, nothing see to praise. They are like automatic entities! They, for a gush of tears, or throb of love, Would hazard more than conqueror ever did, And Cæsar's hardships. Alexander's toils,— Give them the promise of sweet sympathy,— To them like sports of childhood would appear. I—I—am one of these!— LE CHARIER. You jest, Count Colville. COUNT COLVILLE. Ah, that I did! the icy cold that weighs Upon my heart, the tearless speculation With which mine eyes see scenes even of anguish, That make my blood creep in my veins, and all My bodily functions seem to paralyze, These symptoms, though invisible to others, Cleaving with importunity to me, Tell but too plainly, to the wretch who feels them, Of a disorganized and shattered conscience. It is by its inexorable pang, Immitigable, inextinguishable, Alone, that I retain a consciousness Of conscience, and discover that I have one.— As to all other joys, I am quite dead To its approval;—to its terrors, victim!— I talk of virtue, but I feel it not!— Talk of religion, but I cannot pray!— And talk of loving, loveless, and unloved! In youth, I pious forms of speech acquired; In youth with virtuous men alone I lived; In youth I framed to virtue my demeanour; And though my speech, my feelings, and my deeds, Still, like a parrot that can talk by rote, Bear virtue's impress, her sweet peace of mind, Her joys unspeakable, are gone for ever!— I am called hugonot, called heretic!— I am no hugonot, no heretic!— But I am one who have too freely tasted Fruit of the tree of knowledge, not to smile At modern commutations,—called Religion,— For sense of moral obligation, And practice of the human hearted virtues. Not but that I believe that heaven consents Slight penance to accept for slight offences. But when the sense of duty is thrown off, None but slight minds at slight offences stop. Offences these of superficial souls, Which cannot or be great in vice or virtue. There are some of etherial innocence: And there are others of mixed temperament, Who cannot or be great in vice or virtue. But those whose virtues are pre-eminent, Are they of perilous natures, who have borne Faithfully a commingled communing, With deep solicitings from froward passions.— Woe be to those who have at once in them Angel combined with devil, and through weakness Have let the latter gain th' ascendancy.— These, these know what it literally is, When they have basely yielded to temptation, To realize again the angel's fall. Hell,—Heaven,—are within them: and the shows Of outward things, as they are prone to yield To ill, or firm as spirits militant T'assist the better cause, reflect on them Infernal horror, or celestial brightness!— So, on the other hand, how bright at last, Shines, like the fire of Vesta, the trimmed lamp, Which,—though it have been cumbered with thick fogs, Or oft half quenched by surly visitings From felon blasts, and noisome damps, and storms Of rain, hail, sleet, and snow,—a good man tends E'en to the hour of final dissolution With vigilant unintermitted toil!— Yet think not I complain! Though buffeted By (sorest of misfortunes here below!) The anguish of a lacerated conscience, I yet can see, or think I see, e'en here, In this untoward world, the ascendancy Of truth o'er error; o'er the ill, of good; A permanence in moral excellence; A self-destructive mutability In pain, and falsehood, and calamity; And thence the promise of the final triumph Of truth, of virtue, and of happiness!— LE CHARIER. Since earliest youth have I been visited With manifold calamities! In none Of these could I discern that man possessed A more than instrumental agency!— A mightier than myself has scourged me. I have bowed down in silent passiveness, Have learned humility: and 'mid all woes Religion a sure comforter has been!— COUNT COLVILLE. When I consider the infinity, The contrariety, complexity, Of powers that bear upon this scene, not made For mortal explanation, I am lost In wonder at the order thence educed,— Their skilful adaptation! With a good, Is there an evil which teems not? Unfit To assume another, and a better form, In nature an abortion? We accuse Men, institutions, as they were the cause Of evil. But the bitterness with which We make the accusation, proves to me That its seat deeper lies—in our own hearts! LE CHARIER. Talk ever thus! Though I am one whose fate Is spited by the world, I love the world, And those my brethren who inhabit it. It soothes me thus in human things to trace A power educing good from imperfection. COUNT COLVILLE. So, my friend, is it! 'Tis the fortunate Who chiefly at their destiny complain. Who, for the most part suffer, if they be Among those numbered, to whom ‘all things work Together for their good,’ learn to endure In silence: to ‘rejoice with thankfulness’ When it is mitigated. “Then at once “Their tongues are loosen'd, and their lips unclosed. “Somewhat of virtue, health, and happiness, “Form the preponderant experience “Of mortals; hence as contraries, and hence “As of more rare occurrence of the two, “Of instances to the reverse we talk, “And he who has fewest of these contraries “Talks with the loudest, and the bitterest tongue! “'Tis an exception which he cannot brook! “We never hear men marvel when they're well!— “Comment, as on a miracle, on joy!— “As thing unheard of, celebrate success!— “Or speak of safety as a prodigy!— “From health allotted, for one grateful word; “From joy imparted, for one warm thanksgiving; “From friendship shewn, one tributary praise; “How many rash ones from infirmity! “How many peevish ones from wretchedness! “How many pinings from ingratitude! “And these, meanwhile, it might be clearly shewn, “Are the exceptions to the general rule.”— Enough of this! Le Charier, let me now Do that to which I've pledged myself already! Yet not to you, as to a Confessor, Do I myself disburthen! No, I deem, God hates not, with an arbitrary hatred, The vicious, but from contrariety Of vice to his pure essence.—Change of heart, Alone can be a grateful sacrifice To Him, not mere confession, much less penance, And all the juggling tricks by which the crafty,— Making them the equivalents for virtue,— Have sought, as one means of ascendency, To gain an influence o'er coward souls, Enervate from the consciousness of guilt. I therefore, as from friend to friend, and not As to a priest—would all priests were like you, Though staunch, and willing martyrdom t'endure In the high cause of your religion, yet Deeming diversity of forms no more Than of man's levity, imperfectness, His love of change, tenaciousness for shew Rather than substance, necessary fruits:— Therefore I sent to you, that, ere I leave My native land for ever, as from friend To bosom friend, I might to you impart— That which I never yet have done to any— The clue from whence to comprehend,—the spring, The master-key of,—my heart's mystery!— I am not what I seem! Le Charier, no!— Hear from my lips that which I really am!— The self-denying, exemplary, Colville,— The mortified ascetic Colville is— LE CHARIER. Stop! stop! for mercy's sake! Your countenance Is wild, and agitated! You are ill!— You know not that which you are saying.— COUNT COLVILLE. I Know but too well! In order to destroy A fabric of foundationless repute, Which I have gained with you, and a few more,— For narrow is my circle of acquaintance— To you,—who judge of others by yourself, And cannot, without the reality, Of the appearance, dream, of rectitude,— I, this confession make. My heart will be Tormented less, when it has once to you Communicated its mysterious secret: Although it cost me pangs like those which wait Upon the hour when soul and body part; Yea, anguish indescribably intense, And throes of agonizing fearfulness! Your friend, your Colville is— (A Servant enters). SERVANT. A lady, sir, Waits, in a chariot, at your door, who fain Would speak with you. COUNT COLVILLE. This must be Julia Villeneuve. (To Le Charier). May I request you to retire now? Soon As from this lady I'm released—at least Or ere I lay me on my pillow—will I The rest of my confession make to you. LE CHARIER. Sir, I retire. May heaven bring healing to you! [As Le Charier withdraws on one side, Julia Villeneuve enters on the other]. SCENE THE SECOND. Count Colville and Julia Villeneuve. JULIA VILLENEUVE (in deep mourning). Your name is Colville, sir? COUNT COLVILLE. It is. JULIA. I fain Would beg, that you, on my abrupt intrusion, Would put no harsh construction. I am driven By stern necessity.— COUNT COLVILLE. (To the Servant, who still waits). Place chairs, and then Withdraw from hence. (To Julia). Madam, sit down I pray you. And trust, that, whatsoe'er your purpose be, I think myself indebted to the cause Which brought so sweet a visitant.— JULIA. My name Is Julia Villeneuve. I am not, I trust, Mistaken, thinking you the gentleman Who once was intimate with one near of kin: Son to my mother's brother? The Duke D'Ormond? COUNT COLVILLE. Such honour once I boasted. But of him What have you to relate? JULIA. That you're his friend You do not disavow. COUNT COLVILLE. I fain would not. JULIA. Say, is he well? Tidings of any sort Were welcomer to me than none at all. COUNT COLVILLE (aside). Poor girl! I greatly fear— (To Julia). I trust he's well. JULIA. I fain would trust the same. I came to you,— Myself divesting of my sex's fears, That to enquire, of which to be resolved, Though disappointingly, to my worn spirits Were better than to linger in surmise. COUNT COLVILLE (aside). Poor injured innocent! What shall I say?— (To Julia). Have you of late then not had tidings of him? JULIA. For the strange step which I have taken now Better apology I cannot make, Than by divulging to you, that, to which It otherwise would pain me to give utterance. An aged mother, aged and infirm, To whom I had not only to supply The place of child, but who, on earth, save me, No other knew whose love she might command, And the Duke D'Ormond, were to me, at once The only objects of my youthful love.— When they were joined they made my only world: Disjoin'd, the absent only seemed o'th' two The dearer, since the absent. Had it been Either, that one had seemed for the time the dearest, And the remaining one been incomplete.— She now is gone, of whom to talk so now, Seems like profaneness!—May I speak to you?— There is indulgence in your eye; and that In you, which prompts to confidence!—I prate.— But, sir, time presses! I am sore beset!— All the complexion of my future days, All that, for which, in long, unsleeping nights, I've prayed, and wept: all,—all,—is now at stake! She is no more! My mother is no more! Oh, may I tell it you? Pious she was, But she was what is deemed heretical In times like these; though never outwardly She left the bosom of her mother church, Yet both by precept, and example, she Discountenanced persecution, of the which Religion—so to indulge malicious tempers— Rather than cause, was pretext. Such the Duke was. I An orphan am sent hither, not by friends,— No,—no,—but by the hard ensnaring wiles Of those on whom, now,—friendless, parentless— The power devolves of governing my fate. To-day is my last day of liberty! A cloister's walls to-morrow will receive me In living sepulture! I hither came With one attendant, and in former times While I, in happier hour, the play-mate was Of D'Ormond, having learned, from seeing him Write letters to you, how to address you,—more, Having myself wrote letters to him, when He was your guest,—the place of your abode I knew, and ere the last sad fatal moment For ever from the world has sever'd me, I came to crave of you,—pardon the freedom, Since I am ignorant of his abode,— News of a kinsman and a once dear friend. COUNT COLVILLE (aside). Poor friendless innocent! I pity thee!— What can I say to comfort her?— JULIA. You seem Disquieted! Pray tell me all,—all—all! I can bear all! I think I can!— COUNT COLVILLE. Will you Permit me, ere, to nearer interests, Our conversation turns, to step aside To speak to one who has it in his power More to confirm me in the replication To all your interrogatories? JULIA. Sir! Use ceremony not with me! Its rules In coming here I've broken. Sufferance now Is all I have to plead for, and perhaps 'Tis more than I should now anticipate. COUNT COLVILLE. Lady, this self disparagement, ill suits Your character: though since it is sincere— For insincerity could never speak In tones like your's—strong in its weakness, 'tis To me a theme for veneration! I wish a second time to question one Better informed than I, from whence I may Learn that which either may confirm, or, as I fain would rather hope, enable me To dissipate, your apprehensive fears. JULIA. To you I'm much beholden! COUNT COLVILLE. He who could, Beholding you, not wish to make you happy, Must have indeed a heart of adamant. [Exit. JULIA (alone). I'm not mistaken. My conjectures were So favourable of Count Colville's goodness, From sentiments which I beheld in letters, In past times, written from him to Duke D'Ormond, That I by this was,—and the confidence He lived above the world's vain ceremonies,— Urged, and emboldened such a step to take. D'Ormond, canst thou have made thyself unworthy Of a friend so excellent? I will not think it! Yet when the Count I questioned of his friend Why should he thus with hesitation answer?— Ah D'Ormond, didst thou as myself remember The lovely days we spent together, when The year was in its prime, all change to thee Were now, as 'tis to me, impossible!— How did affection, and fidelity Saint-like and pure, seem to inspire thy voice, When walking in free converse, burst on us The beauties of a renovated world!— The swelling buds, the animating warmth That through all nature seemed to penetrate, The song of birds, the clear blue atmosphere, All told us of th' Eternal who walked forth And through the very common forms of things Breathed an immortal re-productiveness. Re-enter Count (aside). What can I say to her? Rather than speak That which I must, I would announce his death. JULIA (who had caught his last words). “Death!” Did you say he is dead? Then I indeed Am friendless and undone! [Faints. COUNT COLVILLE. Poor girl! Poor orphan! If apprehension of her D'Ormond's death Thus agitate her, at the thought I shudder Of what must be th' effect of telling her That of which now Le Charier has this instant A second time to-night given me assurance. Further enquiry but confirms, not weakens Th' impression which his story made on me. (To Julia, reviving). No, lady, no, he is not dead! He lives!— JULIA. D'Ormond! COUNT COLVILLE. Poor girl! He is not dead! No, no— Yet lives he. (Aside). But I rather would announce His death to her, than his degraded state!— Yet, noble, or so seemed it, was his nature! JULIA (catching his last words). Was noble, say you? And “so seemed it?” Oh, You wrong his nature! Noble 'tis, and can Never be aught save noble! Now I think on't, He must have oft mentioned my name to you! His kinswoman, his Julia Villeneuve, and His aunt, her mother, could not but be known To one so dear a friend as you are to him? COUNT COLVILLE. (aside). Oh, that I might that title challenge still! I soon would bring him to this lady's side. (To Julia). His “dear friend?” Yes, I was so, and am still! That is, he's dear to me! and I would fain Believe that I am dear to him; would fain Still be a friend to him.—Yes, yes, you are By me well known, and worthily esteemed. JULIA. Why then delay so, if you deem me worthy Of such a trust, to give some palliative At least, to my anxiety for him? I know him rash; and these are perilous times. Impassion'd too is he; and Paris is Full of temptations. All these things I know. So deeply my inquietudes are seated Sometimes they almost rise to agony!— Perhaps you disapprove— COUNT COLVILLE. No, no, I cannot Disapprove aught with so much innocence. No, no—I cannot disapprove—I,—I,— Rather compassionate—I would say respect,— That is, I venerate—I would say,—I know Not what to say.— JULIA. I cannot bear suspense Like this!—Tell me at once if he be living. Or—I mean is he well or ill?—Is he?— You know what I would say! Your look persuades me You only know too well! Would he, good sir, His cousin know again? his play-mate know In days gone by, in former happier hours? All I can bear to hear: I think I can: I'm stronger than I seem: at doubt I tremble, But, when I know the worst, I'm resolute! COUNT COLVILLE. Yes, he is living. JULIA. Ill? COUNT COLVILLE. No. Yes.— JULIA. Good sir, Point out to me the place of his abode. Perhaps e'en now he stands in need of solace?— Who can so well as I, that long have known him, Known him from infancy, with all his ways Am well acquainted, to his wants supply A nurse's place?—Oh agony!—Alas, I rave!—I did forget that all this while, No longer of my person, time, abode, Am I the mistress!— COUNT COLVILLE. Lovely enthusiast!— How shall I break it to her?— (With great solemnity). Julia!— [Julia starts from her chair.] Be seated, madam! Force yourself to calmness, Or I can ill perform the painful task I have before me! The Duke D'Ormond lives; Far as I know he is in health, but— JULIA. Sir?— COUNT COLVILLE. The rest you must conjecture.—I can't tell it.— JULIA. He loves another? Is she worthy of him?— COUNT COLVILLE (aside). How, e'en i'th' midst of her emotions, are Her first thoughts promptings of a generous nature! This elevation in her sentiments Gives my chained tongue the utterance it needs. (To Julia). To say the truth, he is no more the man Whom you and I once knew.— JULIA. I scarce can think it! Except my corporal senses vouch its truth. This were indeed a heavy blow! have hours, Hours, days, and sleepless nights, weeks, months, and years, Spent by me in unsolaced carefulness, In prayers and tears for him brought nought but this!— It is a heavy blow! But may not you Be misinformed? COUNT COLVILLE. Ah, madam, that I were! Most freely, for it so to prove, would I Surrender every claim to future credence! But, 'twere to flatter you to think it possible. For though with me he has declined all commerce, By means of one of known veracity,— And one, who, in his measure, fain would be, As much as I, a friend to him, I gain Tidings of him, not,—as you well may think— To gratify a curious disposition; But—for a moment should conviction smite him,— That I may be prepared to avail myself Of such an interval, to extricate Him from the snares in which he is involved. To be explicit,—for I can perceive I agitate you, and torment as much By this imperfect, as I could divulging With the most perfect, confidence, his state. Your mind is by religion fortified I trust. Here you will need to have recourse To such support. Yet it is preferable To know the extent of a calamity, To being left to dark surmise—and here I have, for this disclosure, double reason.— To you I look now as the only means Of bringing him again to duty's path.— And that you may be able to apply Wisely a remedy, you first must know The extent, and nature of the malady.— JULIA. In such experiment were my life forfeit, Were I successful, I should deem the price As nothing! COUNT COLVILLE. I believe you most devoutly!— Now to my tale—and listen, if you can, With seeming calmness, or in vain shall I Endeavour calmly to sustain my part. With men of desperate character, Duke D'Ormond, And desperate fortune, for some six months past, Has closely leagued himself; or rather, they But too successfully have spread their snare To entangle him as their confederate. They are aware how ample is his fortune; I, from to-day's report, have gained fresh clue Whereby to unravel his late purposes. I have no doubt but that the self-abasement He felt, when so ignobly he left you, And your infirm and venerable mother,— From the degrading influence of remorse When paltered with, and not accompanied By strict resolve to heed its prohibitions,— Prepared his mind for the ascendancy Of those pernicious schemes which have enthralled him. Although his irritable restless passions Suffered him not to keep the post of duty, But urged him to forsake you (to such minds A good far distant is no good at all). And as you had resolved so long as lived Your mother, not to join to his your fate; That other duties might not interfere With a devout exclusive care for her; So he was galled, and left you—as I gained From his own lips—in an unlucky hour Of moody passion: though, I say, the throes Of a tempestuous, fiery temperament, Urged him to this, they could not silence in him. But rather they augmented,—inasmuch As such a character is always gifted With a proportion'd sensibility,— The gnawings of remorse. This very fact, Of failure in one point, prepar'd in him The state which fitted him for more declension. How oft do persons wanting self-controul, Transgress with open eyes, and agonized With piercing consciousness of self-betrayal, Not only wrongly act, but act more wrongly, With fiercer eagerness, proportionate To the intensity of their remorse!— Hoping each new step of delinquency May bring clear riddance to their consciousness, And cast oblivion on those gone before. His passions you well know—for those who know Him well, like you, cannot have fail'd to mark it— Are always on the very verge of frenzy. With sensibility, and genius too Richly endowed, his judgment hitherto Hath not proportionably been matured. This genius, and sensibility, Give him imaginative power to frame A portraiture most exquisite of virtue: And give him even rapturously to feel Influence from what is fair, and good, and perfect; And deeply in his heart to venerate All elevating qualities, all those Which are sublime and awful! Yet, alas! From want of strength of resolution He sometimes deviates from the standard fixed Within his mind of worth! Ah then, how keen— E'en in proportion to his keen perceptions,— Is his remorse! How turbulent its throes!— How wild its transports! Were he lost to virtue, For ever lost, her cause would be deprived Of one, by nature fitted most to grace it. JULIA. Of him you're worthy. Worthily you praise him. Ah! can he have a friend like you, and leave His faithful side, for the perfidious lure Of adulating minions, parasites, Men that make traffic of a brother's weakness? COUNT COLVILLE. So now it seems. When first he hither came, He passed my threshold once or twice. Of you I question'd him; and from his manner feared All was not right with him. In former times, And in his letters, never were his words So eloquent, as when you were his theme. The subject now he waived; talked wildly; muttered Something 'bout wilfulness, propriety; And measur'd coldness.—Just enough for me To gather that his feelings were incensed By some refusal on your part to plight Your faith to his, so long as to your love Your mother's life was spared. At last, by means Of one, a friar mendicant, by name Le Charier, I gain'd intelligence That he had leagued with desperate adventurers: I wrote to him: begged him to come to me: And somewhat perhaps inadvertently Hinted at his delinquency. He deigned Not a reply. Oft have I sought his house:— Never is he to me accessible. By letter oft have I addressed him: yet Never has answer been returned: at last One was sent back unopened. Thus, at length, Closed ten years intercourse! From his fifteenth year Had he been known to me. All that I since Have learned of him, has, through the means been gained Of this Le Charier: who, this evening, called At a famed house for banqueting, to which, With his unworthy colleagues, frequently He, as I am informed, resorts: and grieved Am I to say, that all which I have learned This evening, but confirms my former fears.— JULIA. Ah, God!—But, sir—may I the nature ask?— You understand me?— COUNT COLVILLE. Yes, too well I do!— As at my tale's commencement I affirmed, He by a set of harpies is environed, Whom, probably,—though he consort with them,— He with ineffable contempt regards.— Leader of these confederates in vice, And profligate voluptuousness, is one, Courtenaye by name, a man exactly fitted To gain ascendency o'er such a mind As that of the Duke D'Ormond. You must be, From native sense, instinctively aware, Young though you be, and though your bosom hides, In its clear region, no suspicious thoughts; That 'tis not so much as men act on others That they gain influence, as that they be framed, Iron-nerv'd, of impenetrable stuff, So that no other men can act on them.— Coldness e'en with fatuity, that walks Unswerving in one line (when leagued with souls, However gifted, that are self-betrayed From too exceeding warmth, not counterbalanced By an antagonist energy of judgment) Will gain th' ascendancy, and rule e'en those Of mettle framed for a more noble lot: As we at least should think, did not, when brought To the test of proof, th' anticipation vanish. Thus Courtenaye inaccessible to all The irresolute fluctuations of the Duke, And with a character to comprehend, Though not to emulate, his attributes, Has, at the same time power to assume the semblance, Though spurious, of a fascinating fervour; And he discriminates enough to feel, When their propensities are weighed, what most At once ensnares, and captivates his victims. He hides the most flagitious callousness 'Neath the exterior of warm-hearted frankness. And seeming the mere shuttlecock of whim, Caprice, and gaiety, or, when he chuses, With most enthusiastic ardour fraught, He is impenetrably cold, untouched By conscientious yearnings: not one twinge Of that conviction, which makes men relent In their bad purposes,—howe'er he may Scatter dismay, and ruin, and despair Around him,—ever touched his heart of steel! Well, well he knew that he could never rule Duke D'Ormond's soul, 'till he had mastery gained Of his master passion:—could discriminate That this ascendency he ne'er could gain With his inferior talents and endowments, 'Till he, by leading him to do some deed Abhorrent to his nature, that he felt Degrading, made him with himself at war. Love, lawless love—I rack your soul—and mine Burns, as in torment, at the cruel tale,— This was the passion, this the instrument He chose, as best adapted to his end.— As virtuous love would militate against him, So thought he a licentious paramour, Mainly if she abetted his designs, And in his interest were, would rivet fast His chains.—Most noble of the works of nature, When blest with spirit of self-sacrifice, At once a heroine, and tremulous In sensitiveness, so as to know how To bind man's wounds most efficaciously, What canst thou not, oh woman, when sublime, And tender thou in soul art, not perform! To such a woman I commit Duke D'Ormond. This is not flattery! Though I now but first Beheld you, much of you has been to me Reported; and your countenance tells a tale To which the heart yields an implicit credence. Save him! oh, save him! Something to my heart Whispers to me that it is in your power; And may heaven's blessing help you to perform it Without yourself being a sacrifice. Oh, save him! All my influence over him Is at an end! But let a full placed trust In your own power, derived from trust in heaven, Inspire you, with a blessing from above, You yet may be a “lantern to his feet,” “Light to his path!” But to my narrative— Duke D'Ormond has been introduced by Courtenaye To th' Marchioness de Mielcour. Thus it seems That fate decrees it of your sex to be Glorious, or perilous prerogative, To work redemption for him or perdition. This lady is, as I am told, disposed, With passionate devotion, to abet The schemes of Courtenaye: while she has address To transfer to your D'Ormond—for I still Shall think him your's and call him so—the semblance Of that devotion, she is doing this But as auxiliar to her paramour. But you have heard enough. Once more I go To-morrow to his door. Will you go with me? Wherever you appoint, I'll call for you.— I will, if he be there, make my way to him, Even should his name be refused to me. Once more from my lips shall he hear the truth! And by the silent pleading of your presence Accompanied, truth he cannot resist. JULIA. Should he refuse to see me? Oh my god, I almost tremble to anticipate The possibility of such a slight From one so dear to me; to place myself In circumstance which gives to him the power So cruelly to shake me off, and wrong me!— But I have but one day! Decide for me!— Oh, should he prove my saviour! and while he Generously snatches me from living death, Oh, should the rapture of that thought become Thrice rapturous, thinking that I also am The humble instrument him to restore To that nobility, that radiance Of soul—if by himself not forfeited— By birth-right, and inheritance, his own!— Yes, could I be subservient to a means Of benefit to him, e'en such a wrong As that of being banish'd from his presence, I calmly could confront! I love too well! I've loved too long; and too much for himself I love him, in my breast to harbour pride! True love fears not, since it can never feel Humiliation!— COUNT COLVILLE. He shall not refuse To see you. I will summon him before you As convict to the presence of his judge. JULIA. But I have nothing to reproach him with. 'Twas my tenacious firmness to abide By that which I thought duty dictated, That drove him from me. I am portionless! The little cottage in the which I dwelt With my infirm and venerable mother, Forbade, from scantiness of room, a change In our domestic habits, had her health Permitted, which it did not, such a scheme. The same infirmity, 'twas so extreme, Alike forbade what oft Duke D'Ormond urged, That, when united, we should to his aunt, A mother then to him, propose to dwell, Inmate in her hereditary home. Not only, then, the circumstance that all Her habits were conformed to long abode, Even from early life, in this small dwelling; Not only this forbade what else might seem Means to augment her comfort, but still more Such incapacity for personal change Of place, was her's, that I could never bear Even to hint to her of his proposal; Lest from a generous wish, or ere she died To see me in a safe protection placed, She should insist on my conformity To a change, in which I knew she could not share, And thus to her a sacrifice. Though blind, She loved this little spot. A happy wife There lived she with her lord. It was a home In which an only brother, long since dead, And I, were educated; 'twas to her As the whole world! Its scanty garden plot, The hum of bees hived there, which still she heard On a warm summer's day, the scent of flowers, The honey-suckle which trailed round its porch, Its orchard, field, and trees, her universe!— I knew she could not long be spared to me. Her sufferings, when alleviated best, Were most acute; and I could best perform That sacred task. I wished to lengthen out,— By consecrating to her every moment,— Her being to myself! A life I prized, Not as that only of a tender mother, But as that of a character endowed With every attribute to excite at once Reverence and tenderness: and latterly She seemed to me, so exemplary was Her resignation, so sublime her patience, Not only spite of insuppressive pangs, But even more so seemed she from these pangs, A saint! Though wasting in her bodily frame, A spirit raised above mortality, And by anticipating heaven on earth Beatified below. Could I leave her?— I might have seen her,—such was D'Ormond's plea— Each day. But who her evening hours could cheer? Her long and solitary evening hours?— Talk her, or haply sing her, to her sleep?— Read to her? smooth her pillow? Lastly make Morning seem morning with a daughter's welcome? For morning's light ne'er visited her eyes!— Well! I refused to quit her! D'Ormond grew Absent, reserved, nay splenetic and petulant! He left the Province, nor has he once sent A kind enquiry so t'alleviate His heavy absence. COUNT COLVILLE. You have done Your duty.—I will be with you to-morrow At any time that you may choose to appoint: When we will to Duke D'Ormond's house proceed. JULIA. At noon, if it so please you. Now, good sir, Accept the only boon which I can offer, The fervent incense of a grateful heart. I now retire. Next to the trust I have In heaven's mercy, and protecting care, The consciousness that you will be my friend Will most alleviate the cruel hours Of worn anxiety, that, till to-morrow, It will be mine to spend; and most support My drooping spirits, till the moment come For th' interview so wished for, and so feared. Farewell! Believe me bound to you for ever. COUNT COLVILLE. My blessing on you! May th' almighty arm Protect you; and his gracious spirit pour A healing balm into your wounded breast. END OF ACT THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIRD ACT. SCENE THE FIRST. The Hotel of the Marchioness de Mielcour. THE MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. THESE men, what fools do they become, when once We have enslaved them. Here I Courtenaye see, And the Duke D'Ormond crawling at my feet! Do I love Courtenaye? That I cannot tell. Love the Duke D'Ormond? That's more puzzling still! I scarcely know, or what, or whom, I love! I only know, that, for my life's enjoyment, 'Tis requisite that I indulge the love Of power, and pleasure! Of my passions, first, The love of power is; second, that of pleasure! Courtenaye loves me, but loves his interest more; This gives a spirit to his intercourse, And lends a piquancy to the attempt To vanquish him. The certainty I feel That I have yet to make myself the mistress, Not of the outworks of his character Alone, but also of its strong hold, gives Charms, to my restless spirit, to his commerce, Which I feel not in that of the Duke D'Ormond. Courtenaye brings most amusement, and the Duke Has not sufficiently a heart to give To be the object of a serious passion. As if he were to me the world in one He is as jealous and exacting; yet I see his spirit has its absences, Its infidelities, and reveries Of past-done things. Ought such an one to ask The entire homage of a single heart? Besides his commerce,—if one so may speak,— Puts in one's hands no play. He does not make Any resistance; and, absurd enough, Unsympathizing, ask for sympathy. He is all sentiment, and melancholy; And say, what woman, if she had a spirit, E'er lik'd a sentimental paramour. What woman e'er, if she had spirit, liked One that capitulates when first attacked? Besides, I half despise him. This I know That he another lady has forsaken, With more of that which gives love warranty Endowed, aye infinitely more, than that To which I can lay claim! Am I not fallen? Fallen irrecoverably? In my own esteem I am: and self-blame sets the seal to that Which constitutes essentially a fall. What though I still have too much pride t'admit A partner in the consciousness of this, The worm that gnaws within me, and that preys E'en on my very vitals,—till at last It shall consume me,—forces on my soul A dire conviction I may not evade. One day it will consume me! But as long As I can hinder it, external mark, Sigh, tear, complaint, or any other sign Of inward heaviness, shall ne'er attest Its ravages. When I am only fit To be compassionated,—since I can, Without self-loathing, ne'er be so,—let me Be so placed that I must be, what I should If otherwise it could be,—uncompassioned. I never saw one that could pity nobly. Those have I who could nobly have been pitied. But suffering is the charter of the noble, And he who has not its pernicious essence Lodged in his breast, of bliss was never worthy. But truce with all reflections! In these veins While the tumultuous pulse of passion throbs, The high solicitings will I obey Of an impetuous temperament. Ye talk Of conquering worlds, tyrants of Macedon, And Rome! What are your proudest boasts compared With those of even slighted woman? Our's Is the dominion o'er the human heart! The noblest empire this! The passions we— You sway—of that high creature man—alone The bodily functions! and not e'en these Till ye have first debased him to the brute, And robbed him of his noblest patrimony,— A patrimony imprescriptible To those who chuse to keep it—Liberty! More glorious an achievement in my thought Than subjugation of the universe, The subjugation of one human heart! (Enter Courtenaye). COURTENAYE. You love me not, Maria. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Of all men You have least reason to make this assertion. COURTENAYE. Duke D'Ormond? Aye, confess now, the Duke D'Ormond? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. What? Would you first intreat me to allure him, And then reproach me for the scheme's success?— COURTENAYE (aside). Yet, must I wear the mask of amorous dalliance; It suits my purpose best; else would she not, (High as her nature is) yield that to interest, Which now she thinks she yields to love, for me. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Talk not to me thus, Courtenaye, think you not My conduct towards him, of my love for you, Proof most convincing? Have I not consented For you to do that which no other man Would dare to ask me, and which by no other, And for no other, as I ne'er was asked, Much less did I ever resolve, to do?— To be your instrument have I not agreed, That, to your purpose, more effectively He may be won?— (Aside). Fool! let him, if he can, believe all this! Woe be to him, who, of his fellow beings Makes a convenient tool, if he should chance To aim at this, when with accomplice leagued More comprehensive both in scope of thought, From higher, and from wider range of feelings, With more resources from a richer nature; With one more subtle and more circumspect. The greatest insult man to man can shew Is, in emergency, of him to make Slave of th' occasion! What must this then be When woman is by man insulted thus?— Woman defenceless by her nature? Hell A crime torments not fit to match with this! COURTENAYE, (Who, during her soliloquy had been walking to and fro on the back part of the room, returning to the Marchioness.) Then you do not love D'Ormond? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Help me here, Ye powers that wait on woman to dissemble. (To Courtenaye). Can you love one who at your very feet Crawls? Can you value him who values not Himself? When once a man into one's breast Has poured forth all the mysteries of his nature, He's like a casket of its jewels stripped. Then curiosity is consummate!— That fatal is. Ambition too is sated!— That is more fatal!—Lastly, all the stress Which both to passions nam'd, and nameless, brings Excitement, is no more; all energy To stimulate, to interest, at an end!— This is more fatal still! But at his door Lies yet a deeper sin, not negative, But positive: a sin it is, in man, By woman not to be forgiven! He, 'Stead of amusing, wants to be amused!— What mistress could endure to be obliged To take the burthen wholly on herself To be love's purveyor? He is consumed By deep remorse. And, self-dissatisfied, As others thus estranged from natural joy, And all spontaneous cheerfulness, is doomed Living to sepulture; repining, froward, And fraught with most fastidious selfishness! As to a Circe, he to me repairs, That I, by draughts of passion, may divide Him, by intoxication, from his thoughts.— Now his Aspasia, now his Æsculapius; His recreation,—or—his medicine chest!— Any thing may I rather be to him Than mistress of his heart! Give me a man That is romantic, or is vain enough, E'n in the dream of love, to deem that he Subjugates me, that mightily enhances The dear delight of subjugating him. COURTENAYE. You are a wondrous creature! Born to prove What nature can, in a munificent, And frolic mood produce; when satiate Of treading in a customary path, She would give evidence of original power.— Like those who play at chess, you take us all For men of wood, and move us to your purpose As life were merely a fantastic game. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). So be it.—It my purpose suits most well That he should think so. (To Courtenaye). I allow you, Courtenaye, At least a castle's privilege: for here Am I by you immured. COURTENAYE. Immured! I wish Only that you should hold yourself select For the Duke's visit for a little week.— One little week is all! But a truce now With these superfluous episodes. I wish Now to converse most seriously with you. If you love me, now is the time to prove it. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. If I love you! Name but the proof which you Require of me, and see if I do not, To the least little, execute your wish. But first, let me retire a little instant, To urge an order, till Duke D'Ormond come, To give admission to no visitor. [Exit. COURTENAYE (alone). That I'm his heir, being his father's nephew On my mother's side, and that my name is Villeneuve, This, as she little does suspect, by me So shall she ne'er be told, till my schemes are For such disclosure ripe. For knowing this, As she would then perceive how it imports To my aggrandizement that D'Ormond falls, She would at once see through my stratagems; And of my actions every tendency, And bearing, of a circumventive nature Conducive to the ruin of Duke D'Ormond, Knowing my weal dependent on his woe, She would at once discern! Her noble nature Would utterly revolt, if she knew all Both of my projects, and my means to make them Desperately bear on the Duke D'Ormond's fate. (The Marchioness re-enters). COURTENAYE, (To the Marchioness de Mielcour, both seated). Of my past life, though you know not the whole, You know the greatest part. You know that I Though wealthy once, am now a ruined man. Chance has thrown D'Ormond in my way: he's rich; A little of his wealth would do me service. Of him I cannot make a man of pleasure, Much less a man of dissolute life. He must Be, by his passions, not his senses, ruled.— With inextinguishable appetite For sympathy—in men of temperament Like to his own, which is so often found,— He is peculiarly endowed. Indeed, No more, as I conjecture, could he live Without some object,—or fantastical, Or real,—for his heart,—no matter which,— For both amount to the same thing with him,— Than other men without the vital air, Save through the fascination of your sex, No hold have I on him. To fascinate him Try; and use all your powers to enslave him. So shall his absent fair,—in some sort, who Is still to him as an external conscience, Be from his memory razed. Of this world's goods He nothing heeds. The heart,—and that alone,— And its fantastic joys or miseries Constitute his sole universe.—Of walks Which, during evenings of the summer past, He with his mistress took, still will he rave Of the warm breezes stealing from some bank,— Where the pale primrose, and the violet grew,— Choicest perfumes, and playing on their cheeks, Or with the crisped tresses of his love. Of her frank confidence bewitching him With its sincerity, and innocence! Of converse, though spontaneous, pure and calm As that, which, in the abodes of Paradise, Immortal spirits with each other hold.— From him eradicate, I do beseech you, All these pedantic rhapsodies. If you But have the will, you have the power, to do it. You can, with our sex, with your heaven of beauty, Do any thing, you know you can; this knowledge Gives you the liberty of spirit to do it. Root, root them out! and make him your's; and then He's mine for ever! Then he is as much To my shrine brought, as any victim ever To the fantastic gods of Greece or Rome! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Mean, despicable wretch! He little thinks The effect his exhortations have on me!— To what fools, vanity, dost thou tranform Men of some talents! Till this moment never So loathed I Courtenaye, nor so well loved D'Ormond! But now to have the real sway, I must, In my turn, simulate! What intercourse Is this! To this we bring ourselves by vice! The love of wicked friends converts to fear, That fear to hate, and this brings one, or both, To worthy danger, and deserved death. Shakspeare.Comrades in guilt, however they commence With love most ardent, soon begin to fear Each other, then to hate, and finally Mutually to seek in secret to contrive The ruin of each other! (To Courtenaye). All shall be Done as you counsel. Well you know I cannot Refuse you any thing. [A knock is heard. COURTENAYE. But D'Ormond comes. Here is his picture, which to you I promised: Wear it, but not exposed: and, in exchange Give me my own: be quick. Retire, I pray you, I fain would here awhile converse with D'Ormond: And if of you he catch but one slight glance I scarcely shall arrest his absent thoughts. [The Marchioness de Mielcour goes out, darting towards Courtenaye, unperceived by him, a look of the most profound contempt.] COURTENAYE (alone). Cursed chance! Thus have I this night ventured all, All that I had to lose, and lost it all! Duke D'Ormond ne'er came as he promis'd. Well! I must allow him, for a little time, To feel at liberty; like bird, with thread Invisible, of gossamery woof, Ensnared, that, having yet not tried to fly Beyond its tether, knows not 'tis a prisoner: Then will I pounce upon him, and transfer All his rich acres to my now drained purse. Besides, although he know it not,—and though I take good care that others know it not,— I, next of kin, am of his wealth the heir, Though, since i'th' female line, not of his title. A home-thrust I must make! Things, many days, Cannot remain, as now they are, and I Be visible in Paris. This same night Thy doom, Duke D'Ormond, shall be consummated. To-night shalt thou be in De Mielcour's arms Imparadis'd; but to that paradise,— As to the happy dwellers in thy clime, Oh Eden,—shall a lasting hell succeed. Satiety will soon come! Soonest, best!— Provided with it liberty come not!— I will take care to rivet well his chains; And make him scoop out,—as with his own hands,— A bottomless pit of everlasting woe. I can frame circumstances so,—from this His passion for the Marchioness de Mielcour,— That—with his turbulent impetuousness, And exquisite conscience,—he shall so transgress Against the laws of honour, as respects His former love, that this alternative Alone remains to him,—to die a victim;— And then I quietly ascend his seat;— Or,—from his conscience being in my power,— And from that recklessness which deep remorse, Especially in minds so sensitive Produces—so to have his master-key— Like that of instrument of music—touched, That all his purposes I subjugate. (Enter the Duke D'Ormond). DUKE D'ORMOND. What Courtenaye, are you here? It seems, methinks, These few days past, you haunt me, not unlike One's shadow, both in constancy and gloom. COURTENAYE (aside). Jealous, by Jupiter! I did not think That he was yet so far by passion master'd. Here's a new tool with which to clench his fetters! I will so little, and so much, as suits My purpose, on this weakness work, to me Delectably adapted! and that other— The quick suspicion which cleaves evermore To men of sensibility, and makes Them exquisitely shrink from ridicule. (To the Duke). What, are you jealous, Duke?— DUKE D'ORMOND. No, no! Not jealous! You well may claim certain prescriptive right From intercourse previous to mine with her, To commerce with the Marchioness de Mielcour: But let me this gently insinuate,— Not, since thus, that I am less absolute That,—save on public opportunities,— Your visits here will be,—to me at least— Welcome proportionably as they are rare. COURTENAYE, (Aside, but loud enough for the Duke to hear). How would he blame his passion, could he know What fondness prompted her to say of him! (To the Duke). What—man of sentiment as you are—cannot You comprehend that a fond heart which is Wronged with reserves by the object of its love,— If not entirely slighted, kept at distance,— Will seek almost instinctively for one To whom it may disburthen its repressed, And unrequited sensibilities. DUKE D'ORMOND (aside). Oh, could I once believe 'twere so! (To Courtenaye). But how Do you from hence infer necessity For commerce 'twixt the Marchioness and you?— COURTENAYE, (Aside, but still purposely loud enough for the Duke to hear). On his romantic generosity, On his too exquisite refinement, I Fear its effects, especially should not The passion be reciprocal in him.— A nature like to his should I tell him Her love's excess, from its excess of honour Might thence be irretrievably induced Its freedom to surrender: and till I Learn if her boundless passion be returned, How can I risk disclosure of her secret?— I am perplexed! (To the Duke, as if suddenly roused from deep meditation). But how from hence, say you, Do I infer necessity for commerce 'Twixt myself and the Marchioness? 'Tis well, Well acted, on my life! This infantine Unconsciousness most marvellously fits A person altogether so unskilled As you, in arts to win the softer sex! Let not a swift involuntary smile Of incredulity, that will reveal My thoughts, by you be construed into rudeness. DUKE D'ORMOND. No more perplex me! What does all this mean? Of “exquisite refinement” on my part, “Romantic generosity?”—For I— Though sure you meant it not,—o'erheard your speech, And “boundless passion on the lady's?” COURTENAYE. How Have I betray'd her, and myself! These walls Must be constructed like a whispering gallery! DUKE D'ORMOND. You agonize me! Be explicit. Once,— Once in your life, prove that you are my friend. COURTENAYE, (Affecting not to hear the Duke, and to be in such a state of abstraction that he is insensible to the presence of any second person). Then her consummate delicacy. She Has rumours of a prior preference heard. Would it not be ungenerous, base, to tell Her secret, 'till the Duke had given proof Of being weaned from all anterior ties?— It would—it would! I must be cautious!— DUKE D'ORMOND. You Will drive me mad! I cannot bear it more! [Drawing his sword. Am I to deem you as my friend, or rival? COURTENAYE, (Affecting a loud laugh of surprise). By Jove, most excellent! Rival indeed! (Aside). I see I've stung his soul now to a pitch Just fitting for my purpose. (To the Duke). Rival indeed! She had a moderate regard for me. Too rational, too phlegmatic, it was To flatter me. And that is over now, All over! Cæsar-like you've crossed my path, And, like him, you may say, I came, I saw, I conquer'd. DUKE D'ORMOND. Listen Courtenaye.—I cannot Value the favours of the brightest dame Till first I know that I possess her heart. Idol I must be of, the universe I must be to, the woman that I love!— A wandering of the eye, a sentiment Uttered in absent tone, a look, a gesture, Vacant expression of the countenance, Which made it questionable whether one— A spirit paramount—and that the spirit Of most idolatrous fondness—did pervade Her entire being, would, to my repose,— To my desires, be fatal. Think, then—think,— What must my feelings be, in finding you,— A man notorious for promiscuous intrigue, And libertine adventure,—more than this,— Although, to say it, I know, will but feed Your vanity, now too exorbitant, Yet still will I repeat it,—you, a man Notorious for successful gallantry; What must my feelings be, I say, to find Such an one closetted in secret converse With her my heart is bursting to obtain? COURTENAYE. But let me state a case. A fond heart feign— And here you need not feign—o'erflowing with Excess of tenderness! Further suppose The object on the which that heart is fixed Itself, irresolute is, and dilatory; Mysteriously cautious in surrendering Up its whole self to this devoted heart? Cruel surmises, anxious conflicts, must Be the result of this, in her who thus Feels,—with a circumspective guardedness,— Wholly unmerited by her profound Self-dedication,—herself wronged;—yet such Her love, she rather weeps in solitude, Than seeks on that wrong to recriminate. Will such an one, in such predicament, Occasion not most naturally seek, Into the bosom of a long tried friend Her sorrows to disburthen? Such has been The character of this night's colloquy Betwixt the Marchioness and me. She loves you, Dotes on you; loves you to distraction, Duke! Could you so cold, so unimpassioned be As with contemptuous levity to treat her? No, you could not! Have I not now well proved Myself your friend? Do you suppose the task I have imposed upon myself,—to that, With which perhaps you've not without cause taxed me, My vanity,—is acceptable?—No!— I'm galled; but I'm your friend! and friendship now Unseals my lips, which honour else had closed. But let me not suppose that I've betrayed Her honour, in this proof of zeal for you. A fear lest this might be the case, alone Has kept that secret, which some four months past, The Marchioness imparted first to me. DUKE D'ORMOND. Now, Edward, now indeed you are my friend! Older are you than I, and in the world, And in its ways, more deeply have been trained. Oh, could I trust that that which you have said To me, were true; were literally true, I were the happiest man on earth! But I Am new to men and manners. Can I think That,—from the many polished cavaliers Who seek her favour,—she can turn aside To one who's still in his noviciate?— COURTENAYE. As proof of it, look at this picture here. It is a likeness of myself I gave her Just ere you came to Paris. She has this Returned to me within the last half hour, Assuring me that equally the depth, And delicacy of her love for you, Forbid her longer, free from self-reproach, To have possession of a bauble, once Given to her as pledge of my regard. At the same moment, she has, from my hands, Received a picture of yourself, which you, As you may recollect, gave to my keeping Some four months since, and which you now will find Tied round her neck. Discovering that I had it, She, with an eagerness I scarce could brook, For many weeks past has begged it of me: Loth was I to agree to this exchange, Implying such a mortifying preference; At last, won by her importunities, I promised it: and I this evening brought— When you of me so needlessly were jealous— That, on the one hand, which her love for you Made her so highly prize, and took from her Th' humiliating proof of her indifference. (Aside). If this to him seem not apochryphal, I now may deem him my affianced dupe. DUKE D'ORMOND. Ah Courtenaye, how can I express to you, In worthy terms, my gratitude? How could I De Mielcour misjudge thee thus?— COURTENAYE (aside). Yes, with his proneness to become the victim Of female fascination, and my power To work upon his jealousy, from long Previous intelligence with his fair mistress,— E'en had I no more instruments than these To set at work, I may, as I could wish, Keep him at bay.— (To the Duke). But why waste we our time Discoursing here? The Marchioness de Mielcour, Breathless with expectation, waits for you In yon apartment. DUKE D'ORMOND. Wherefore did you not Intimate this to me an hour ago?— You might have sav'd me from a world of anguish? COURTENAYE (aside). Whereby I've gained a world in expectation. (To the Duke). Why, look you, Duke, it is exorbitant To quarrel with a half-hour of suspense, If that be harbinger to ecstacy!— Meantime, I own, I somewhat have exceeded A gentleman usher's function. But reflect While you are gaining, I had to resign; And tell me now, have not I, with good grace, Exchanged a higher, for a lower post? DUKE D'ORMOND. Adieu till midnight. Courtenaye you sup here? You come then in no questionable shape. [Exit. COURTENAYE (alone). Au revoir. This, to him, shall be a banquet Fatal, though not so bloody, as that given By Atreus to Thyestes. I will pledge him Deep in Circean nectar. The last link Of his chain shall be rivetted to-night. [The House of Despard] (Enter Despard). DESPARD. Courtenaye, well met, of all men in the world, You are the one whom most I wished to see. I to your house have been; not finding you, Hither was I directed thence. My heart Bursts for relief till to your friendly ears, I have divulged th' adventures of the day. Oh Courtenaye, I think you'll scarce credit me, When I repeat to you this evening's chance. The pleasantest, at least the one most pregnant, With various interest, that I ever met with. You know I tracked a fair incognita This evening from our bacchanalian orgies, I pray you guess, though 'twill be to no purpose Although you rack your brain from now 'till doomsday, Guess, who this heroine turns out to be. COURTENAYE. Some demirep I'll warrant. None but those Whose reputation nothing can repair Would enter on an intrigue with a man Of your dilapidated patrimony; And with not wit enough for one short hour To play a part consistently.— DESPARD. You've missed The mark, quite miss'd it. My fair paramour, As yet, plays an involuntary part. She's innocent, and pure, as driven snow; And beauteous as an angel!— COURTENAYE. Angel! Tush!— An angel and yourself could not exist One hour in the same hemisphere. (Aside). I must Feign incredulity to get his secret; And then I must abatement make of half Of that which he asserts; his vanity Leads him to fictions so extravagant. (To Despard.) “Angel” forsooth! and “pure as driven snow.” Why all the devils in a female shape The world e'er saw, with you contrasted, might Seem such. DESPARD. But D'Ormond's mistress? What think you O'th' fair incognita of La Vendée? COURTENAYE (aside). This is worth listening to. (To Despard). You are romancing? DESPARD. No. The very lady—since he reverenced her Too much her name to mention—about whom We've been so often with conjectures puzzled, She in my power is: and a prize more glorious Never the blood warmed, or inspired the lays, Of a Provençal cavalier or bard!— COURTENAYE. What is her name? DESPARD. Curse my o'ermaster'd spirit, O'ermaster'd by her dignity of virtue, I never thought to ask it: if I had She would not have vouchsafed to answer me. COURTENAYE. Fool that you are! In the main point are you Deficient! Here's a tale without a title! How did you find her out? How learn her tale? How bring her to your dwelling? DESPARD. If you please One question at a time. You saw me leave Your company in haste. I had espied By light of lamps hung in the colonnade Which flanks the house in which we banqueted, A damsel, young, and lovely, and alone, Enter a chariot. I contrived, by speed, To keep it in my sight, until it stopped At the Count Colville's door. Night favour'd me. From questions, which, while skulking near her chariot, I heard her ask of him who drove her thither, I not alone learned that she was a stranger, But with entire simplicity, to me The most accommodating, nothing knew Of town-bred manners. I found out that she Meant to return to th' house from whence she came. The entrance of my own is not unlike That of the one which she had quitted. I Thus deemed it better not to intercept Her going to Count Colville's house, because While there she tarried I might hasten on To my own door, which fortunately stands Much about the same distance from Count Colville's As the hotel from whence she first set forth. Thus might she easily take one for t'other, As she designed, as I before express'd The latter to regain; thus set I forward To my own house, not only with intent My servants to prepare for her reception, But also one to send to Colville's door, To see my bidding to the charioteer, Whom with a bribe I had already won, To carry her to mine, exactly followed. Every thing chanc'd according to my wish. The darkness of the night, her ignorance Of Paris, and the close resemblance 'twixt The entrance of my dwelling, and the one Belonging to the hotel she had quitted.— Which, in my memory, was residence Of an ambassador,—prevented her,— Till she had passed my threshold, and already Was in my custody,—from fearing guile.— COURTENAYE. Have you ta'en 'special care your lady be Well guarded in her lodging? Lock and key, Have you peremptory command of these?— DESPARD. Trust me for that. A mouse could not escape Without my sufferance. COURTENAYE. So far very well. Am I to understand that I'm indebted To vanity for your frank confidence, Which with its plethora would burst, if it Did not relieve itself; or may you have Connected with the adventure of the night, Any commands to tax my service with? If so I'm your's. (Aside). My superintendence here Is indispensable. DESPARD. There, Courtenaye, you Have the right cause assigned for my disclosure. Though I doubt not but that this lady has From the Count heard Duke D'Ormond's faithlessness, Yet still she raves of him! It would be told By him, in such a dainty, choice selection Of circumlocutory ambages;— Besides she is so innocent, unsuspecting, Had it not been thus told, her breast so is Incapable of guessing to what height Vice is indulged, and with what shameless front It stalks forth, in this gay metropolis; That—these things being so—e'en her worst suspicions Would fall far short of the reality. You may be sure that at the moment I— By immolating expeditiously— Wished to secure my victim to myself. Yet, curses on me, she apostrophized My better feelings,—feelings, I knew not That I possessed, till I had heard her speak,— So irresistibly, that I was led Not to enforce possession of her person, Till (that I thus might alienate her heart From its strong prepossession in his favour) I, like a fool, had blabbed out the extent Of the Duke's infidelity. This caused A fit of swooning, from the which, ere I Quitted her, she was but enough recovered To be, supported by two persons, led To a neighbouring chamber. COURTENAYE. Hear! a sudden thought, E'en as you spoke, has struck me. At midnight Have the Duke D'Ormond and the Marchioness Invited me en tiers to a banquet.— For the catastrophe devoutly wished By me, i'faith, but I will prime him well! And if I can fit coadjutors find, Though it is somewhat perilous,—yet who E'er heard of scheme that is to consummate, And in few hours, a complicated plot, That was not perilous proportionably To its decisiveness?—Yes, yes! If I Fit coadjutors can select, I will Mould to my wish his destinies for ever. Hear me. To-night shall D'Ormond, and De Mielcour, Repose on their first nuptial couch! No couch For him of roses, but eternal thorns! Yes, this night I've decreed that all my schemes Shall be consummated. So I ere this Had purposed, but this last intelligence Of the arrival of his former love My earnestness redoubles: 'tis a portent Which to a crisis all at once matures My former indefatigable toils. So when a long train of combustibles Subtly is laid, if once the fated spark Be struck, what fierce explosion bursts at once From all the quiet vaults in which they lay. I have, as I had skill to do it, played Upon him with a simulated tale Of fancied injuries towards the Marchioness, From slights, and coldness, she has felt from him. The Duke—like valetudinarian epicure Who flavours craves, and subtle essences, To stimulate his appetite—must have His very pleasures, and voluptuous pastimes Seasoned with metaphysic condiments. I doubt, indeed, if pleasure had enough Of dainty excitation, for his taste, Were it not spiced—as we in costly banquets Produce at last most piquant relishes, And often most esteemed when most unnatural. With keen anticipations of remorse!— A certain casuistry, a daringness Of venturing somewhat on forbidden regions, A prying into nature's mysteries, The dark, th' indefinite, th' obscure, the doubtful, All these are indispensable to give Meet pungency to it, when the Duke D'Ormond Selects an object for his appetites. If he were cheaply so, he were not blessed E'en in paradisaical abode.— The staking his eternal interest In a nocturnal revel, wondrously Adds to its charms with him. Do you, to-morrow, Precisely at the hour of matins, bring Your nameless fair into his presence, while His passion yet is raised to the highest pitch, And as a loathsome weed he'll cast her off. DESPARD. You are my master-spirit.—I will be Governed by your direction. COURTENAYE. If the blow Be once struck, it will surely “trammel up With its surcease, success.” Let him cast off His mistress once: she then is wholly your's. For though he never told to me her name, I have heard him say she had no friend on earth Except an aged mother. DESPARD. She is dead.— To that her mourning garments bear a witness. Also that which she said of being released From house of sorrow, and a death-bed scene. COURTENAYE. She has then no protector but yourself, And what your own deserts could not achieve Necessity may work for you. How soon Soe'er remorse Duke D'Ormond seize, no matter, Be this point once obtained! The soonest, best! Only take care, that, in this juncture, you Co-operate firmly. If remorse seize him, He is not one of your steel-fibred heroes, Who boldly will confront its menaces, And hold a parley with it. No: he must Have stimulants; and what so probable, In what is he so sure to be o'ermatched,— If his soul from its centre be disturb'd,— And he with my longer experience cope,— As,—last resource, when disinherited, Of those who thought themselves the sons of bliss— The gaming table? 'Stablish him once there, And our prosperity is past all doubt. DESPARD. I understand the drift of your contrivance; It pleases me; and I address myself To execute it promptly. Now farewell. COURTENAYE. Farewell! Remember, Despard, I now trust To your discretion, and arbitrement The master-spring, the potent spell, from whence All the complexion of our future days, Whether or prosperous or adverse fortune Fall to our lot, exclusively depend. [Exit Despard. COURTENAYE (alone). I every moment now expect a summons To inform me that my servants wait my pleasure To attend me to the Marchioness de Mielcour's. Now must the irrevocable blow be struck! Within this very hour am I to meet The Duke with his De Mielcour at my side To second my endeavours. True, she knows Nought of my projects. But no less is she— Rather the more so—since unconscious— Fit instrument to work my purposes. Not knowing all my ends, and all my means To work those ends, she may be influenced Oft to co-operate, when otherwise— If she knew all—difference of character Might militate against my stratagems. Thus seeming less to do so—since the end Not seems—do I the more do that which seems not, But is; and passes all mere semblances!— To-night must union of the Duke with her Consummate that of mine with prosperous fortune. To-night,—Duke D'Ormond's feelings, as I know, Are ripe for this,—to-night, yes, yes, this night,— Shall they be joined in ties irrevocable. The appearance of this lady, first to me This scheme suggested. Yes, he shall not see her, Till he have placed between himself and her A barrier insurmountable. I meant But by a snare of gallantry t'entrap him. From this he may escape. But if they be Married,—ah married! Then such sanctity The law, his conscience, and the prejudice Of all conditions to this tie attach, Ah then, in vain will this his earliest mistress, So opportunely at this instant found, E'en though she be a kneeling suppliant, plead For a renewal of his love. I see It all. I'll to a priest, now I have done With Despard. To the yielding Marchioness Then will I hasten with the holy man: And since I know they're ripe for any scheme That gives a pledge of permanence to their passion, E'en while the iron's hot,—I'll strike the blow!— And, ere the day be passed, I'll so frame things They shall be bound in everlasting ties. Passion, which causes others to be victims, And conscience which makes one of its possessor, Unite in D'Ormond. One into itself Too much absorbs all objects not to ask A victim! and too scrupulous the other Respecting those same objects not to be, Even, as 'tis the likeliest chance, if not So by a self-retributory act, By a fix'd fate, predestined to destruction. Him have I doom'd to be t' himself a victim! My thoughts are yet confused: but a dim notion That he would spurn his former mistress from him If she were introduced to him abruptly While yet his soul is revelling in bliss From new-born transports with the Marchioness. And thence, by nice attention on my part To the shades of—and opportunities For working on—his irritable passions, That he might so be made the instrument (By spurning her from him whom most he cherished, Most lov'd, and most devoutly reverenced) Of her destruction; and, from thence, of his: By the fatalities which, in the train, Lurk, of a wounded conscience! All these thoughts, Rush, like peace-murdering, sleep-destroying fiends, In one impetuous torrent through my bosom. But then—ah!—let me see! He must not meet, A second time, her that once is mistress Both of his heart and conscience. Means must be Discovered for removing her from hence, After the interview, to my abode, Or that of Despard! Yes, I see it all:— “Hear it not Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell!” SCENE THE SECOND. An Apartment in the House of Despard. (Despard leading in Julia, from the vestibule, or hall of the house, in which he had met her, attempting to make her escape.) DESPARD. I THOUGHT I had completely frustrated The possibility of such a meeting. (To Julia). Where in such haste, good madam? JULIA. Any where! Any where, so that I may make escape From this ill mansion. DESPARD. But should I bring Good tidings?—I one promise asked from you A short time since; you gave it; and your flight Precipitate, induces me to think You are disposed to break it. I have so But poor encouragement to challenge you To another promise, on a strict compliance With all whose terms, and on whose strict fulfilment, All the complexion, of the hopes which rule Your future fate, exclusively depends. JULIA. What mean you, sir? DESPARD. Did I not, some hour past, Promise to inform you of the present state Of the Duke D'Ormond, having first expressed To you some other slight preliminaries, If you would promise that you would not seek T'escape from my protection? Did you not To all these terms agree?—How am I then To understand this unannounced attempt At an elopement from your room, to which I thought that you were reconciled, at least For this one night? JULIA. I reconciled!—If so,— It is the reconcilement of despair. But by what right do you assume the power To interrogate me with authority?— 'Tis a poor boast to trample thus on one Too weak for self-protection! who has not— Or you would not presume to do it—one To stand her friend! When I that promise made, (Whence you infer such plausible pretence To shackle me, and rivet so my chains That I am thus your wretched thrall for life) Had I not every reason to suppose That the disclosure you would make to me Of D'Ormond—if not satisfactory— Would be, at least, definitive, and clear?— Whereas, by that which you have utter'd you Have raised in me such horrible surmise, That I have now no hope, but in the hope That your reports are not authentical! DESPARD. Be calm, be patient, madam! In my power Now are you, and— JULIA. For this I can't be calm!— You're like an executioner, who lifts The griding axe above his victim's head, And bids him—from th' unutterable depth Of his perception of power paramount, From the extreme of his despair—to smile! Calm,—calm, indeed! DESPARD, (Stupidly and doggedly going on; and from self-complacency not adverting to the apostrophe of Julia). I hold the clue, by which 'Tis in your power t'unwind this labyrinth. It now depends on me, whether or ere To-morrow noon, or whether you no more Behold the Duke. JULIA (aside). E'en on the very verge Of what a precipice do I seem tottering? All my life's hopes are turned to casualties. When I look at him, the vile instrument Seems incommensurate with such dread sway! DESPARD. You answer not! JULIA. Almighty God, is this In human nature? Calmly to behold— Breathless with earnestness—a fellow creature Enduring absolutely, as it were Death-pangs t'obtain a good, which though it be Fantastic, is the all of earthly bliss To that heart-stricken one,—yea, every thing? Yet, like an angler, can a human being— Dallying with th'expectation of another, Torturing a writhing victim, which alas! He has inextricably snared already— Extract—from mere indulgence of his power To agonize—a calm, malicious joy. DESPARD. These are mere rhapsodies of powerless passion. JULIA. They're powerless, granted; not rhapsodical. For mercy's sake, not unrelentingly View pangs like mine! You calmly play a part: While on the issue of the present hour I am a bankrupt, or enriched for ever!— From house of mourning, from a death-bed scene I am but just released. But that was heaven— For there religion was—compared with this!— There pious trust was, there tranquillity!— E'en in my tears was there infused a balm!— But now my brain is dry; or if I weep, Like marble damps, my unrelieving tears Unreconciling seem, unreconciled, As are the pangs which wring them from their source! This, this is madness! I am unprepared, Unfit, for such a conflict.— DESPARD. Madam, think you That what I have to say will lessen it?— I fear 'twill not! At least, not if the Duke Be its distinguish'd object.—Oh, that I Had, in your favour, such an interest, As to suffice to change your grief to joy! JULIA. You're practising on my credulity; My ignorance of the world, and apprehensions! Into compliance would you torture me With that to which my lips can frame no utterance. (In an altered and softened tone). But I forget. Count Colville told me this. He hinted to me.—Oh, it is too much. [Sinks down in a chair. DESPARD. There is no method but to tell her all. If I do not, she ne'er will listen to me. JULIA, (With an hysterical wildness, which Despard, in his stupidity, mistakes for rage). What art thou muttering there thou fiend of hell? DESPARD. (Approaching her, and endeavouring to throw his arms around her). If you will have recourse to violence, I will give proof that I too can be violent. Are you for open war? You, in this house, Are quite defenceless! Here, I reign supreme!— With a forbearing generosity, Which you abuse, too long I have treated you. JULIA. You generous! you forbearing! I despise Your mean unmanly threats! You may destroy me, But till that's done my will shall master your's. Oh, D'Ormond, could'st thou see thy Julia now! DESPARD, (Wrapt up in himself and not condescending to heed her). Self-love is ruling principle of all, Of good, and bad alike.—The difference this.— Whose self-love is in sympathy with that Of other men, are called the good:—the bad, Wretches whose self-love is anomalous! You think your bliss depends on D'Ormond; I That mine on you. Thus are we crossed alike. Which has most reason to upbraid the other? You are averse from my love, he from your's,— Or at least I, which comes to the same thing. Yet for an interview 'twixt him and you Willing am I to afford facilities, But only on the terms, as, on your part, Of certain condescensions, so on mine, Of certain stipulations. JULIA. Sir, proceed. DESPARD. Now hear me, madam—that to which I will, Without prevarication, pledge myself To execute, provided, on your side, You will an acquiescence promise me In consequences I anticipate. JULIA. Name them, sir. DESPARD. I, to-morrow, promise you, Unspotted as you are, to yield you up To the Duke's arms, if you will likewise promise, If he reject you, to return to mine. JULIA, (Aside, and deeply affected). Oh God! Is he so fallen? Somewhat of him This man must know! Can he so fallen be As with such caitiffs live in fellowship? DESPARD. What say you, madam, to this compromise? JULIA (aside). Oh, could I now prevaricate? My God, What shall I do? Do thou protect and guide My inexperienc'd youth? Count Colville said That he at noon would call at the Duke's door. Did I not in the Duke find a protector, Surely I should in his once valued friend!— Could I but stipulate that I should be At that hour taken to Duke D'Ormond's house?— DESPARD. You seem absorbed in thought.—Pray answer me. JULIA (still aside). Yet should I not be safe, at any rate, If I were once admitted to his presence? There's comfort in that thought! But should I be The dupe of hypocritical pretences! DESPARD. Sure you've had time enough to meditate Upon my proposition. JULIA. Yes—no—yes!— What shall I say? It is a fearful venture. Suppose he take me to some lonely place Far from the city! I'm perplexed. (To Despard.) What hour Would you appoint for th' interview? DESPARD (aside). What hour!— Beshrew me if she's not her stratagems, As well as I my own. (To Julia). At what hour? What Can the hour signify? Why, at the hour Which I shall chuse.—The matin bell shall be The signal for our going. JULIA. Better 'twere At noon! DESPARD. My fair enchantress, no! (Aside). I'faith, I 'gin to think she has her emissaries To do her bidding. Can she—no—have tamper'd With Madame D'Orville, or my pursuivants? That is impossible! But yet it looks Suspicious, thus to stipulate the time. However, 'tis enough, that hour should not Be, since 'tis her, my choice. (To Julia). No, at the hour Of matins; I thought you were all impatient To see Duke D'Ormond. What can work this change? If all impatient, why thus cruelly Defer the interview?— JULIA (aside). Hypocrisy, How difficult to those to simulate Untaught by thee! (To Despard). Because, sir—why because— I wish,—I think,—the hour of matins sure Is too importunate for the modes of Paris. Because—sir—why because—I wish it so— Is it not early? DESPARD (aside). And I do not wish it, Because you wish it. Here is artifice. Besides with one who is so dear to you, As you affirm Duke D'Ormond is, to whom You are so dear, vain ceremony 'tis To make exception at an early hour. JULIA (aside). Should he have fixed upon that early hour, Because with less chance of detection, he May thus decoy me into further danger? I fear—I greatly fear—his purposes.— How wretched 'tis to be defenceless thus, Defenceless utterly, and in the power Of one who has the will to work your ruin!— DESPARD. Madam, attend! My last proposal hear! At hour of matins, and no other hour, Will I go with you to Duke D'Ormond's house. If he receives you, I surrender you To him, if not, you're mine. JULIA (aside). If he receives me! What dreadful ambiguity is there, What ominous mystery of fearful import, Contain'd in these few words! The time has been This were incredible! What can I do?— I cannot yield to this. Perhaps 'twere best To ask this man to give me till to-morrow His project to consider.—Thus shall I Gain time; and something in my favour may Occur 'twixt now and then. I shall but then Be forced to do his bidding, not worse off Than now I am. At all events, I ought To avoid provoking him to violence. I now am in his power. Utter refusal Would only be a signal for fresh insult. (To Despard). I have one favour, sir, to ask of you. DESPARD. Well, what is it, my fair one?— JULIA. Till to-morrow Give me to think of your proposal. I Beseech you, give me till its earliest dawn. DESPARD (aside). I'faith, her innocence as prolific seems In stratagems as guilt! To-morrow's dawn?— Passion forbids it! It is hard!—But still I may derive advantage to my schemes From one more consultation yet with Courtenaye, Or ere I fix them quite, except this siren, Like to spell-muttering necromancer, have Agents invisible to do her bidding. A thought has struck me. I'll make Colville's name, Spite of his will, subservient to my projects. Courtenaye must be consulted. (To Julia). I consent.— At sun-rise I receive to-morrow morn Your answer, but (Advancing to salute her) You owe to me, at least, Some courteous recompence for this forbearance. To Madame D'Orville now! She must be well Tutor'd to watch this stipulating fair one. [Despard rings, and Julia is conducted into another apartment by Madame D'Orville, and a servant with her.] DESPARD (alone). Yes, I will go to Courtenaye. 'Twixt us both, We will contrive, as written by the Count, A letter to my prisoner, urging her, At hour of matins, to repair—with view Of meeting him there—to Duke D'Ormond's house. Surely by such a bait she will be caught. [Exit Despard. END OF ACT THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOURTH ACT. SCENE THE FIRST. An Apartment in the House of the Count. Count Colville and Le Charier. COUNT COLVILLE. THIS evening I was interrupted, ere The dire confession, which I hold myself Pledged to impart to you, could pass my lips. But let me hasten—since I am resolved That so it shall be—by a solemn use Of the present time, to frustrate any chance Of outward circumstance, in time to come, Of power to hinder that which I've decreed— A dreadful secret—to impart to you!— Your friend,—your Colville,—is a murderer! [A long pause. In youth I lov'd a lady, but of rank Not equal to my own, and portionless. Knowing 'twould be in vain to try to win My father to consent; rich though he was, Poor he esteemed himself, so long as there Was opportunity t' increase his wealth. The softening influence of connubial love, No more remained to him, no mediatrix Betwixt him, and his progeny, to draw Down on them, through the intercession fond Of a wife's love, paternal charities. Ere I was ten years old my mother died. Having impatiently a year endured That hope deferred which maketh the heart sick, I married privately. For twelve short months My bliss seemed perfect; nor the less so seemed From the restraint engendered by concealment; Rather it seemed this gave to my stolen hours Of wedded intercourse, augmented zest. For when that intercourse was interrupted By indispensable concerns, the joy Anticipation brought me, scarce seemed less Than that of actual possession. Such a deep interest did the fervour give Of my affection, that it seemed as life Was one perpetual dream of happiness.— At the expiration of a year, my wife Became a mother: though apparently The dangers of that season she surmounted; Her health from that time failed; a rapid wearing Attended with all symptoms of decay,— Daily and visibly more and more encroached Upon her strength. Though when a stream of joy Was gushing from our hearts, th' allotted stipend E'en of a bachelor, had well sufficed For all our needs: yet from these heavier claims On it, our child's birth, and my Lucy's sickness, From being, at first, spent in expectancy, We found it, in a little time, fall short To our debts due discharge. Th' anxiety I had, that, with all possible solaces For her distemper, Lucy should be furnished, Heavily taxed my means.—At last, to tell My father of my marriage, I resolved. He lived in the country: I in Paris. He Had all society renounc'd. This left No channel open by the means of which Report could reach him of my marriage ties. He was inexorable. Lucy dying, He banished me for ever from his house. Lucy grew worse and worse. I, from the day That made us man and wife, from Lucy hid My means ill suited to an exhibition Adapted to our rank. Love blessed us both. And little time, and less of inclination, Had we to think of aught but love and bliss. Still more tenaciously had I concealed, When first my wife's distemper shewed itself, The truth, in order in her weakened state, Better to reconcile her generous nature To meet indulgences. How could I now, Emaciate, and enfeebled, as she was, Risk such communication? When not only She had become much more unfit to bear it Than in the first stage of her malady, But also, when, from being involved more deeply, Of far more threatening, and appalling import, The story now must be?—Can I proceed? Driven by excess of anguish and despair, I joined a desperate band who met at night Not far from Paris: and the troublous times Favour'd such freebooters' impunity.— O'er this part of my narrative, let me Pass lightly! Many deeds of violence I took a part in, and to many more Was witness, and much booty thence deriv'd. One night, a band of cavaliers, as chance Would have it, through a forest passed, not far From our accustomed haunt:—we met,—dispers'd them! One fired at me. I fired again, and slew him.— But, oh my God,—my friend,—what agonies Think you were mine;—when I beheld—his hair Stiffen'd with clotted blood, pale, cold, a corse!— My father! My companions had departed; I never, from that moment, saw them more! Next day were tidings brought me by a courier, Though without implication on myself, Both of my father's death, and of the means By which his life was forfeit. I too learned That, ere the dire catastrophe had chanced, He, though to no one he had this disclosed, Had in his heart relented towards his son, And dying left me, with the rank of count, His ample patrimony. Thus was I,— The murderer of my father, by that father,— Endowed by means which negatived at once The blessing which such power had been to me, With means to gratify that which had been My heart's first wish since she who ruled it languished, Th' ability not only to relieve, But to anticipate, far wider range, And a far more capricious catalogue, Of wants, than my poor dying wife could feel.— I, at the moment, had myself surrendered To the arm of justice! But for Lucy's sake, And for my child's, to drag on a loath'd life, Did I submit. How could I wring her heart, For whom I would have died, with mental pangs, In the last conflict of her bodily weakness?— Yet when, with all the sweetness of an angel, The dying Lucy thanked me for procuring Palliatives to her from that very crime Which had a father robbed of life, oh think What must have been my shame and desolation! Think of the dreadful contrariety, As to one point converged, 'twixt all that seems Of heaven and hell! How through it did I live?— I know not! Yet griefs are there so intense That, as there are no outward shews to match them, They, as respects the spectator, do bring Impediment against their own betrayal:— Purveyors of their own impunity.— The pangs which revelled, as it were, within me, As they all exhibition, so they passed All utterance by looks, and words, and gestures. I dared not of my father think!—Lest I Should be detected, never did I feel Smallest anxiety!—and perhaps this— Though at the time I took no notice of it— Frustrated my detection. I had sold Myself to hell, from pliability Of temperament; and reckless of the future Myself I suffered now to be borne on By time and chance. She in my arms expired, My Lucy, blessing me for all my care. My child still lived: this the sole hindrance was That I did not, now, for the second time, Myself surrender to the arm of justice. Lest on his life I obloquy should bring, Mine I consented to drag on. My child, The precious being for whose sake alone I had endured a life of speechless woe, Was torn from me in two years afterwards By a rapid malady. Thus was I left— Thus am I still—poor in the midst of wealth: And with the means of mitigating wants, And woes of thousands, solitary, wretched. Endowed through influence of my patrimony, With power t' excite respect and gratitude, And hope in others, yet myself unhoping, Alone, and in despair, unloveable, Unloving, and unloved! If I have known For twenty years which have past since the last Of these calamities, one little hour, Abatement of my insuppressive pangs, I must attribute it to this, that heaven Has, in his mercy, not quite seered my heart: To this,—that,—though I have a crime committed Which never can be pardoned in this world,— The effect of this has rather been in me A deep humility, than, to confound By a sophistical philosophy, Or fatalism atheistical, Right and wrong deeds;—by merging them in motives— And extreme provocation,—to conceal Thus, from my consciousness the magnitude Of my delinquency!—God's name be blessed;— From whom the latter as the former comes, I, with the power, have had the will, to assist The broken-hearted, and the indigent; And to contribute to alleviate The sufferings of those in every rank Who needed such an advocate. LE CHARIER. Thus you Have found employment. Thus has your life been Supplied with something like an object. COUNT COLVILLE. Yes.— But long I've wished to quit my native land. Not only here too many objects wake Yearnings for—an impossibility!— Me to become like other men; but here, Do what I may, do they too potently Remind me of the past, to allow the hope I ever here can that composure gain, To be possessed of which, in some degree Is needful for me, would I dedicate Myself effectively to other's interests. To-morrow I at noon have an appointment With Julia Villeneuve: as you recollect Her coming here this evening broke the thread Of my sad story. I have seen enough Of her to feel assured she well deserves The Duke her cousin even as he was In better days; and that it must be she— Hid as his brightness now is by a cloud— That will—if any one can—bring him back To the fair light of virtue and of peace. Till this end be achieved, I, for myself, No purpose have. In D'Ormond I behold Not only possibility of all That I, had I not fallen, might have been,— But also of much more. With this I see Like perilous propensity to fall:— And, were this so, as he surpasses me In a capacity for excellence, So would he—and I shudder to think of it— In that for crime, and consequent remorse.— I wish that you would go to his abode To-night, and learn if he have been there seen Of late. But do not let my name transpire. As, should he hear it, probably by change Of residence, to-morrow he would frustrate My resolution to converse with him. And if he be not there; I pray you try To learn, where he may, with most likelihood Be found. I need not say discretion use In this research. Farewell. [Exit. LE CHARIER (alone). It pleases me That he has given me this embassy. It turns a train of thought too tragical!— I do not know whether to marvel most At the deep nature of his crime! or most To pity the excess of his remorse; Or most to reverence the sublimity Of his repentance and return to virtue. SCENE THE SECOND. An Apartment in the House of the Marchioness de Mielcour. Courtenaye. (alone). (The apartment supposed to exhibit the appearance of preparations being made for a banquet for the Duke D'Ormond, Courtenaye, and the Marchioness. The Duke and the Marchioness are withdrawn.—A table covered, with lamps, &amp;c. &amp;c. Writing Implements before Courtenaye). COURTENAYE. YES, yes! I know that she'll consent to this. This very evening shall she give her hand To the Duke D'Ormond. But a meddling priest, As was my first intent, when first this scheme Rushed on my thoughts, must not be here admitted. 'Tis difficult in an enterprize like this, So complex, in an instant to perceive All its particular bearings. Thus the tie Would be legitimate; and then, ah then, I, by a fatal inadvertency, Might, had he offspring, be, by this one act, Self-disinherited of D'Ormond's wealth. This must not be! How shall I manage? Could Despard?—Ah, let me see?— Would D'Ormond know him? De Mielcour never saw him! As respects Her, all then is in safety. But—again Where can I find him? For it must be done This very night, if done at all, since D'Ormond To-morrow morning, as we now have planned, Abides the ordeal of an interview With his late mistress. Despard two hours since From hence departed, with a view to guard His new found fair one.—Ah, had I then This scheme proposed to him. The lucky thought Then had not struck me, and besides I was Called by him from De Mielcour in such haste, I had not time to muster at my will My scattered project: yes, he will be here For that same letter which he bade me write, In Colville's name, to his fair fugitive. Ah! this is lucky: thus all things conspire To consummate the scheme. But let me read This letter which I've written. [Walking backwards and forwards, and reading the letter, to be sent, as from Count Colville, to Julia, by Despard.] Here comes D'Ormond. (Enter the Duke D'Ormond). COURTENAYE. I am glad the Marchioness has left us here. I wish to intercede for her. Conduct Yourself towards her with generosity.— Duke, your good fortune with this lady, has Made me quite splenetic. I have beheld De Mielcour like to please ere now: but she Was still the vict'ress, and her lovers were Her slaves. Now is the scene quite changed. sighs, And looks, and sighs again: and by the hour Will she fantastically prate of you.— Trust me, that, for two hours this evening I Have, in being listener to her long encomiums On your sublime perfections, penance paid Which—from the test to which they put my patience,— Would save me, were I convert to the faith, From fear, of purgatorial discipline. DUKE D'ORMOND. Courtenaye, you jest. COURTENAYE. I jest in earnest then!— Take my word for it, you self-torturing sceptic, I jest on that which is no jest to me.— I own I've no aversion to a good Satyric, comic, and ironical Analysis of my dear absent friends.— I love to have them made ridiculous. Would to the world all men were banished it, Who cannot ridicule, or be ridiculous. But how do you think this humorous phiz of mine Could to a worshipful solemnity Compose itself, while, for two mortal hours, I was obliged to sit, and nod assent To a dull catalogue of charms and graces?— DUKE D'ORMOND. This is too much!—I will not stay with you Another moment.—If you e'en had told me Of some sly scandal you and she had hatched, I could have listen'd with more patience. COURTENAYE (aside). Tut!— Of some sly scandal? It shall e'en be so! I'll put his taste in bitters to the test. (To the Duke). You've hit the mark, Duke! She did, I must own, Put in a little mixture of the acid. DUKE D'ORMOND. She did! Did she? COURTENAYE. You men of sentiment, She said, yourselves conducted so by rule, And such magnificent hard phrases mouthed, You seemed more like those that the science learned, Than those that were about to seize a fortress. DUKE D'ORMOND. She said so?— COURTENAYE. Yes, She said,—I mean not you, But men of sentiment,—you take me?—made Love as a minuet is danced at court,— With wondrous grace, and measured gravity. And that you ne'er forgot the retenu, The imposing, and respectful ceremony, Fit for a royal presence: but she added Were we court gentlewomen in full dress, They could not seem more literally to think The farthingale, and tight laced stomacher, The ruff, the sack, the inflexible brocade Were integral constituents of our person. DUKE D'ORMOND. Call you this listening to my eulogy? By Jove, rather than be so eulogized, I would she had exhausted utterly All the vituperative eloquence Of female malediction. COURTENAYE. Then your stores Of rich imaginative sentiment! Your rapid eloquence; your exquisite, And tremulous susceptibility!— Ovid himself would turn with envy pale, While you in metaphors luxuriate; Or periods round, which close developements Of feelings, if not indescribable, Which by not other had been e'er described.— Desires immortal, occult sympathies; Congeniality of ravished souls! Tender, and mystical presentiments, And all the mysteries of the human heart! DUKE D'ORMOND. This is too much! Perdition seize yourself, And her, myself, and all the universe!— You've said enough to give to any man Such a self-loathing, as will cleave to him To all eternity! Since good old times Of chivalry are past, and men have had Recourse to argument instead of arms, The spirit is evaporate, and lost, Which gives all relish to society.— “Just in proportion as the weapon, we “Now use, the tongue, is of less absolute “Decision than the sword, so deeper wounds, “And bitterer pangs, and fiercer feller hate, “More acrimonious animosities, “Does it excite, than the good honest one, “Whose home-thrusts were a countercheck to malice. “Men's hatred then, like the electric spark “Along a bar of steel, passed swiftly off “At the sword's point, and ended in the shock, “And manly brunt, of noble chivalry.— “Now is the hatred deep of seeming friends! “While mutual foes honoured in former times, “The mutual valour of each other's bearing! “Then flourished all the courtesies of life; “Now hatred flourishes, and as it is “To the body hurtless, so the nobler part, “The soul,—it doth,—with most pestiferous humours, “Which have no passage thence,—inoculate! “Whence putrifying rottenness, and plagues, “Faithlessness, treachery, manœuvring wiles, “Base machinations, and night-gendered intrigues, “Distemper'd noisomeness, and loathsome death! “By this abandonment, what have we gained? “More of the sway of reason? No! What lost?— “All that fine tact which deems no wounds so deep “As those which gestures, looks, and words can give. “Saving our bodies, we have lost our souls! “And bought our safety at the price of that, “Honour,—which gives alone to safety charms. “Life in itself is little worth! Worth nought “When in compare with reputation placed!— “Who is to take the measure of a question?— “Where arbitrators, umpires, shall we find “Impeccable, and incorrupt enough, “If 'tis to be by its intrinsic claim, “And metaphysick evidence decided, “'Stead of that good old argument, the sword?— “The villain, or the fool, now gain the day “By ridicule, or bullying: or worse,— “By that which brings more scandalous abuse “Than,from the droit du duel, ever sprung, “Or e'er could spring, if it were practised more, “And prostituted more, than e'er it was “In any civilized community, “The art of intellectual It is true that the phrases are of more modern date than is the period assigned to this play; but in the breaking out of the reformation we may suppose the evil to have existed: and though we profess to write of things past, we do not profess to express these things in an obsolete language.prize-fighting, “The age's talking gladiatorship!” The sword's test, if we grant it not the test Of that cause being righteous which unsheathed It from its scabbard, was, at least, the test That each who had recourse to it, could not be, While living, recreants from the point of honour. As, where this sentiment reigns paramount Society can never worthless be,— As, where it reigns, no man could sit, and hear, Tamely, such argument for just offence As I have heard from you;—and finally,— Since,—though I see around me on all sides Defaulters from it—I hold this creed still;— I therefore challenge you, by morrow's dawn,— The choice of place, of weapons, and attendants, Leaving to you—in mortal strife to meet me. COURTENAYE (aside). This most triumphantly crowns all my wishes! I will not take him at his word to-night.— But thus I'm furnished with a hint which gives Me power, whenever I've the will to do't, If I know not of any other means Myself to disencumber of him. This Gives me such power, since it has given me Knowledge, that I have nought to do to obtain it, But touch this point of honour's delicate edge And straight—he's moved—like puppet is he moved To my soliciting.—But I have now Galled him enough! This sedative must be By double dose of stimulus countervailed, Or by myself my scheme will be defeated.— Should I accept this challenge, and he fall, I am an outlaw, thence comes banishment, And forfeiture of his inheritance.— No, let him have his fighting mood indulged, But not till I've a proxy found, who may Be my cat's paw, while I the booty seize. DUKE D'ORMOND, (Who during this soliloquy had been walking backwards and forwards at the farther end of the apartment). What? Do you add contempt of my just claim, To your contemptuous speech? Why answer not? COURTENAYE, (Stretching out his hand). My friend, you but mistook me all this while.— Mere envy D'Ormond, take my word for it; Mere jealousy and envy! and as proof Of this, here is my hand! The hand of one, A whimsical, but a warm-hearted friend!— Mere jealousy! Why you would have me more, Or less, than man! I am so full of gall, Had I not let a little of it find A disemboguing at the tip o' my tongue, I swear that I had burst! DUKE D'ORMOND. For once be serious.— Thou see'st that I am so! Is't not enough, For thee to put to a perpetual jar My heart-strings in society? We may— Surely we may, when thus we are alone, Each other understand. COURTENAYE. I never was More serious in my life! Nay, my excess Of levity, was only self-love's dalliance, So to hide superfluity of spleen. Somehow, somehow, it must have found a vent! I ask your pardon! From men blessed like you, Forgiveness must anticipate repentance. A man so fortunate that's not forgiving, Would be a mere Thersites in ill luck.— Nay, if I would not stake my life to come; All future possible contingencies Of joys invisible and visible, To be thyself this blessed moment, brand Thy friend for the remainder of his days, As a poltroon and liar! But what must We poor fools do, that are quite out of favour With time, place, person, opportunity?— “With time! I am older than you by ten years!— “With place! I am an alien from my country! “With person! Are you not preferred o'er me “By judgment of our mutual paramour?— “With opportunity! I staked my all, “My little all to-night, and it is gone!— “No! we must either put a good face on it, “Or go hang, drown, poison, or shoot ourselves. “And 'faith, I think a merry vein ne'er stands “In such good stead, as when you are i'th' mood, “To give yourself up, if you had it not, “To all the devils in Christendom.” But now I'm “serious” as you call it. On my word, Duke, she is dying for you. I said always That you sly, sentimental cavaliers Achieved more amorous trophies in one hour Than we frank, merry-hearted, gallant fellows, Whose souls sit quivering on our lips, can hope To win in any twelvemonth. I cannot In sober sadness talk about my heart, A serious business make of amorous dalliance, Or be impassion'd with an earnest look. But, curse it, you that are all over heart, Like animals in every part alive, When some new freak of fashion you're discussing, More eloquence can put in such a theme, Than such a thoughtless spark as I can do In catalogue raisonnée of all mankind's Enslavers, e'en from royal Bathsheba, Down to the present time. Why did not she,— The Marchioness,—tell me, that one glance of your's, One subtle smile, playing, and quivering round Your soul conveying lips,—nay one,—the least Important, and impassion'd of your gestures,— More meaning, in one moment, could convey, Than other men, with their best utterance, could, In whole course of their lives? DUKE D'ORMOND, (Affecting not to hear him). To-morrow night Will you go with me to the masquerade, At the Duke D'Ypres? COURTENAYE. Yes:—no:—methinks, If I give no more heed to the diversion, Than you do to the question you are asking, And my reply to it,—when I am there, I, a female Pygmalion much shall need, To put a soul into my carcase. DUKE D'ORMOND. Come, Let us an end put to this foolery!— I see that at cross-purposes we are. Therefore, au revoir. I will hence awhile.— My soul, though happy, still is sick with thought. I would go meditate, and try to bring This shapeless chaos of confused feeling Into some discipline that may be borne. [Exit. COURTENAYE (alone). That Despard now were here! I have no doubt, Seeing how much he's caught by his fair prize, That he will with alacrity consent A project to promote which so much tends To throw his unprotected fugitive Entirely in his power. 'Tis nigh the hour That he appointed to receive from me This letter. Though time presses, till I've seen Despard, I will not drop most distant hint To D'Ormond of this marriage. He besides Is so irresolute, and seems to shrink So much from any step that stamps a deed With an irrevocable character, 'Twere better that the ceremony trod Close on the heels of its proposal to him.— De Mielcour will be with him here ere long; I'll leave them then together; and meanwhile Will Despard see. Then will I pounce on him, When his soul's melted by excess of love; And if in this mood I should cope with him, And all be ready for the marriage rite, Surely he will not feel so churlishly As not to thank me that I thus have catered, At least as it shall seem to him, to take All scandal from his coming happiness. I'll school De Mielcour to say nought of this To D'Ormond: and besides a woman's pride Would rather that the project be proposed By any lips than her's. But should they ever Discover this my treachery? Then, methinks, Will they not make the tie legitimate?— Ah, long ere this,—for projects like to mine, Or soon succeed, or have an early death,— He shall be soul and body mine, if still, Which much I doubt whether he will, he breathe The vital air! How luckily, in the very nick Of time, here comes the Marchioness. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Is not the Duke here? Courtenaye, where is he? My porter tells me that he just has passed The outer court. Whither at such an hour?— COURTENAYE. He told me that he went to meditate. (Aside). Ah! this is as it should be! 'Twill be well To ply her with this marriage, while her heart, Like a young girl's fond of a truant bird, Feels doubtful whether her precarious, Volatile favourite be safely caged. (To the Marchioness). So Marchioness, while you devote yourself, A willing victim, to a woman's fondness, Have I been pondering on the likeliest means, To render this your love,—for sure I am, Though you confess it not to me, that love For D'Ormond in your heart has subtly crept,— To render this your love a source to you Of lasting happiness: though I, alas! Thus throw away all hope of earthly joy. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Explain yourself. What is this riddle? say.— COURTENAYE. Love you not D'Ormond? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). What shall I say? To him If I speak truth, so little he believes That it is ever spoken, and so seldom Speaks he the truth himself,—never perhaps Except to serve in purposes of fraud,— That he'll not credit me.— (To Courtenaye). Why ask you this?— COURTENAYE. Because I wish to serve you. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Me! To serve?— I thought in this scheme I was to serve you. COURTENAYE. Now hear me. If, as I have shrewdly guessed, D'Ormond has gained an interest in your heart, Why,—why not marry him?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Are you sincere? COURTENAYE. As far as I would be your friend, I am.— As far as I would be my own, I am not. This tie which I magnanimously proffer, From my care for your honour, is to me, And to my comfort, fatal. But methinks, 'Tis for your interest, and I lay aside, When that I contemplate, all selfish thoughts Of my own happiness. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. But why this marriage? COURTENAYE. Nothing will fix Duke D'Ormond but a tie From which he can't escape. It wearies me To see him in irresolution waste His noble powers. You might do much with him. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. 'Twas but this day, this very day, you asked My aid, to make him to yourself subservient. “A little of his wealth would do me service:” Said you not this? What has thus changed you? COURTENAYE. He, Himself. I have been talking with him now! And find him so devoutly fond of you, No more can I resist, when I behold How serious, and how absolute his love For you, to serve him, and yourself: and sure I am, no service in the world of mine, Can equal that which I am rendering him In pleading with you to become his wife. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Should I consent, would D'Ormond?— COURTENAYE. Would he? Aye!— Would he consent to be in Paradise?— Would he consent, having a foretaste had Of joys of heaven, lasting to render them? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Have you no drift in this beyond the sphere Of my perceptions? COURTENAYE. Hear me, on my knees, My eyes suffused with tears; (my beating heart— See how it throbs—with such a fever maddens Of contradictory and ardent wishes Betwixt the mighty sacrifice I make, And the disinterested ecstasy With which he has inspired me, that I can Scarcely my thoughts articulate): hear me then,— If nature can bear the tremendous conflict, And spare me utterance, from the unutterable Emotions that are mine, confess to you The process of this change. Love has done all, Almighty love! I have conversed with D'Ormond; And, as I live, he so has melted me By his description of his love for you, That I start up from 'neath his influence, A man regenerate. His ardent passion, And the warm phrases in the which he's clothed it, Have wrought on all my nature to a change. I do abhor myself in dust and ashes, For all my past degeneracy. So poor, So mean, so abject, worldly projects seem, Such is the indigence in which they starve Who on them batten, or to me so seems it, Since I have quaffed, though from another's cup, Of the rich beverage of delicious passion, That I'm on fire to prove that I'm not quite Unworthy to be loved, by serving one From whom I first have heard, warm from the lips, From whom I first have seen, bright from the eyes, On the cheeks mantling, moulding every gesture To an inimitable suasive grace, From whom I've caught first, living from the heart, Love's language, spirit, and beatitude. Since I cannot be your's, for I am now A man of fortunes wrecked, and 'twould be cruel, E'en were you willing, as I am not vain Enough to think you are, to ask of you To join your fate to mine: since I must now Your love forswear, and yet am all on fire With love's vast power, seeing its force in him, Since I, in short, cannot his votary be, I am resolved his victim to become.— You must have D'Ormond. I have found a priest, Who, this night, will unite you. No,—no scruples. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Can this be true? If love can work such change, Seen in another, in his selfish heart, What must its triumph be, when, like a gem Of rarest value, in a casket rich As that of D'Ormond's bosom, 'tis enshrined?— [The Servant of Courtenaye enters and announces Despard.] COURTENAYE (aside). She must not see him. (To the Servant). Bid him wait. (To the Marchioness). This man Comes with a message from a reverend friar For whom I've sent a quest.— [A Servant of the Marchioness enters and announces the return of the Duke D'Ormond.] COURTENAYE. The Duke's returned, Please you dear Madam leave us here awhile, This emissary of the friar and me. (Aside). The Duke's return now is most opportune, But he must not see Despard. [Courtenaye here whispers to the Servant to bring Despard to the apartment where he now is, after the Marchioness has left it, by a different passage from the one through which the Duke had passed. The Marchioness desires the same servant, when Courtenaye has finished speaking to him, to shew the Duke into the Salle de Compagnie, with the assurance that she will join him immediately]. COURTENAYE (to the Marchioness). But first tell me, Will you, if here the priest come, give consent To join your hand with D'Ormond? He, I know, Wishes this consummation fervently. He begged of me to break it thus to you. But he'll not mention it himself, till I Have told him, whether, as ambassador For him, in this affair, I've prosperous been. Time presses—Answer me, I pray you. When I, with this man have spoken, I'll to D'Ormond With your reply. How do I pity him E'en for this brief suspense!— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Till you see D'Ormond This subject shall not pass my lips. COURTENAYE. And he, I know has not the heart to speak to you, Till he from me receive your answer. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Well.— Perhaps this suit if made by D'Ormond's lips Might gain from me a favourable hearing. [Exit. (Enter Despard). DESPARD. Here have I sought you, Courtenaye, that you may Play off the scheme which we betwixt ourselves Have with such pains matured. But what have you Been doing at De Mielcour's this last hour? COURTENAYE. I've laid a train: and now I only want Fit instrument to touch and play it off, And then the whole is gained. But let us first Read o'er this letter which I've penned for you. DESPARD. Shew me the letter. You say that you can Perfectly imitate Count Colville's writing? COURTENAYE. Perfectly. I so many times have seen Letters addressed by him to D'Ormond. Here,— You see I have already penned it.— [Giving a letter to Despard, who reads. DESPARD (reading). “Madam.” COURTENAYE. I Was forced in this way to begin; for I Know not the lady's name. DESPARD. How then Have you addressed the letter? COURTENAYE. Not at all.— But thank my wit for finding out a cause, And one of likeliest seeming, to assign For that omission. Here,—i'th' postscript. Read it. DESPARD (reading the postscript). “I have sent this letter without a superscription, as I thought it best that your name should not be known to the people of the house in which you are, thus will your honour the better be guarded. I have given such orders for its delivery as cannot fail to ensure it.” COURTENAYE. Now read the letter. DESPARD (reading). “I have discovered the place to which you have been carried. I called at your hotel an hour after you had quitted me, in order to pass a part of the evening with you; and to my great consternation found that you were not returned thither: having some knowledge that a party of gentlemen, of whom the Duke D'Ormond forms one, frequents that house, I enquired whether he or any of his comrades had been there about the time that you were; I found that they had; and that one of them disappeared just at the time that you got into the chariot which brought you to my house; I know his name, and will tell it you when we meet.” COURTENAYE (to Despard). You see that I have kept your secret there. DESPARD (reading). “I went to his house; and discovered through one of his servants, that you are there, but could not gain admission to you; I further discovered through the same servant, that it is his wish that you should meet the Duke D'Ormond to-morrow at the hour of matins. Comply with this wish, by all means. Depend on my meeting you also, and trust that all yet will end well.” “Colville.” DESPARD. Excellent! Now to hinder all surmise, Seal this: and be it given to the lady As though a special messenger from Colville Had brought it to her. So will I affect Ignorance of such transaction. But do you Think she will have credulity enough To trust to this?— COURTENAYE. Oh, never doubt of that! She has been yet used to a country life, Where every one to every one is known, And every incident: and thus, to her This will appear a chance of every day. DESPARD. I only hope the Duke will not insist Upon a second interview. COURTENAYE. Leave that To me. I'll take good care to make the first Too tragical, for him to wish to have, Or perhaps for him e'en to live to see, A second. [Courtenaye folds and seals the letter. Then gives it to a servant of his, who is in waiting, telling him to take it to the house of Despard, and to desire that it may be presented to a lady there, and that she may be told that a messenger brought it to the door, who waits for an answer, which he requires may be delivered to him.] DESPARD. You will meet me at the hour Of matins, at the Marchioness de Mielcour's? COURTENAYE. Precisely at that hour. Wait here till you Receive the lady's answer. Meanwhile listen.— Despard, I have to name a project to you. Will you assist me? I this evening wish To make De Mielcour D'Ormond's seeming bride. But this must not by a legitimate tie Be now accomplished. Heirs might then arise. And I, to 'scape one evil, thus might rush Into another far more terrible!— For I have reasons of my own for wishing Him to be childless; at least, as respects Lawful inheritors of his vast wealth.— Will you the priest's part play? Could you succeed To modulate your voice, and drawlingly To mouth out, with monotonous nasal twang, The formal homily, your cowl and gown,— Especially as all this plot will be Transacted by the mimic light of tapers,— Sufficiently your person would disguise. DESPARD. Trust me for this. I have e'en for the nonce A cowl and gown, in which some weeks ago Accoutred, I made shift to shrive a fair, And willing votary: in the solemn whine, And formal antics of hypocrisy, I am, believe me, though 'tis I that say it, A most consummate adept. COURTENAYE. This I knew Ere thus I spake to you; and this my knowledge Emboldened me to speak thus. I erewhile Worked on De Mielcour so persuasively, Yet with such shew of seeming sacrifice Of my dear love for her; I have so feigned That tender interest for her honour has, Spite of my own despair, urged me to this, That she at last has yielded. Further too I have persuaded her that thus the The reader is not to suppose that Courtenaye really said this to the Marchioness, but to ascribe the assumption of this pretension on her to his own vanity.secret May, of our own love, by this seeming tie Be better guarded: though methought at this, A faint, yet bitter and incredulous smile, Played on her beauteous lips. But to the Duke Nothing of this will she say. From my lips,— And at the critical moment, when most warm He from her converse comes: (for there's the rub,— Lest he should recreant prove) then to his ear Will I this hint impart. Meanwhile, it is Resolved by me that she shall still impute, That same decision to the which I'll goad him, To his intense idolatry for her. DESPARD. All shall be done as you desire.— COURTENAYE. I would Converse awhile with D'Ormond. Meanwhile you Yourself disguise. Procure a missal. Come. In the first place I'll leave the pair together.— Get you the ring.—Hither return:—and when I know that all things are in readiness, And not till then, I will by one bold stroke,— E'en as 'tis said, that, by some serpent's eye, The victim, which, by instinct taught, it seeks, Is fascinated,—by its abrupt ostent, And subtle choice of opportunity, Throw, ere he be aware, around his feet, Though seeming now a wreath of blooming myrtle, Frail, and most easy to unravel, yet Inextricably, a still galling chain. DESPARD. I see your scheme: and am at your command. [The Servant of Courtenaye enters with a note directed to Count Colville. While Courtenaye is opening it, Despard thus speaks aside] I am the more ready to concur in this, Since, all on fire as I am to possess My beauteous prisoner, it so much augments The chances, that she now will wholly be On my protection thrown. COURTENAYE (reading the letter). “To the Count Colville.” “Sir—I will be guided by your direction: thankful am I that you have discovered the place to which I am so unhandsomely brought: but I will not complain, as now I have a prospect of such speedy release. “I have not signed my name, lest this note should fall into the hands of those who might have additional reason to betray me if they knew who I was.” DESPARD. What can she mean by this? She must, methinks, With all this circumspection, be of rank. Spite of her sweet simplicity, the girl's Not without cunning, and prompt artifice. COURTENAYE. What woman ever was? I here had hoped,— Though I said nothing,—and, to tell the truth, This was one motive dictating the letter,— To wind her name out.— DESPARD. We in time shall know it. COURTENAYE. All is as it should be.—Be here again Ere the night close. When you are come, send word Through my own page, who is in waiting here.— Dumb am I, and invisible to both De Mielcour, and the Duke, till you return: That he may not have opportunity To be irresolute, I will not seek Admission to him, till, by your return, You give the signal.—Now,—dispatch;—away! DESPARD. To-night we're fortunate;—we men of intrigue: Like Cæsar we may say, we came, we saw, We conquered: for behold in few brief hours, By us two plots are hatched, arranged, matured! [As they are separating, Despard returns and recalls Courtenaye, who is just passing the threshold on the opposite side of the apartment.] DESPARD. But, Courtenaye, should this plot of our's be known? The Duke is powerful: 'twill be no slight rub.— COURTENAYE. The times are troublous, and impunity Attends far heavier crimes: but I am full, Brim full of projects; and I scarce can doubt That, ere reflection to Duke D'Ormond come, I shall have so unravelled his life's web, That I again may wind it at my will, Or draw it out to its extremity. E'en as the child's breath, or the playful winds, Dally capriciously with thistles' beard, The seeded dandelion, or a tuft Of flax with filaments scarce visible, Or as least gust doth quench a dying flame, Will I annihilate its last least remnants. Risk we this chance. Greatly would we obtain, We greatly too must hazard. Can we be Worse off than we are now? Here is a chance May better us; for if I win, as sure I hope to win some of his ample stores, You shall be also sharer in the spoil.— DESPARD. Farewell! On this condition I am your's. [Exit. COURTENAYE (alone). Poor, easy fool! These semi-men,—these men Part knave, part coward, coward the better half,— Hold but their lives in fee, as ready tools To cater with their souls emasculate For spirits who can sway them, and they ought To think themselves by such a sufferance honoured. [Exit. SCENE THE THIRD. A Salle de Compagnie in the Hotel of the Marchioness de Mielcour. The Duke D'Ormond and the Marchioness de Mielcour. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. SO you return at length! Cruel to me Was the last hour's suspense. DUKE D'ORMOND, (aside). How beautiful She is! Oh, may I only find her mind As lovely as her form, then am I blessed! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Or I, in my opinion, am deceived, Or I may feel assured to acquire in you,— What is to me a novelty in life,— In you may hope to find a friend! DUKE D'ORMOND. A friend? Nay more!—A lover!—An adorer! I Am your's! and you may mould me to your will. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR, (Making room for the Duke on a sofa). Let us be seated. Sit down here.—I have Much now to say to you! DUKE D'ORMOND. Oh! that I could Forget that there were in the world, save you And me, a creature else. I would, to-night With dreams of everlasting happiness Fain flattered be! For I should cease to live With one more shock, one severing of the heart. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Duke, I suspect, were your wish gratified, That soon, with such exclusive intercourse, You would be palled. DUKE D'ORMOND. You, Marchioness, Yet know me not! The burthen of existence Is a fatigue to me. I could endure To live with poverty, with obloquy, With sickness;—but bereft of sympathy I cannot drag on life! A second self I want! The eternal craving of the heart, Which many have described, and few have felt, An inextinguishable passion is In me. Maria, love me.—Tell me that I make you happy. In the quivering glance Of your frank eye, one moment suffer me To recognize the maddening fire that burns Within the very centre of my soul, And D'Ormond thinks himself supremely blessed. I am no man of gallantry. I am Of female conquests no monopolist. But who would condescend to owe to me Her happiness, she, she will find there lives A vernal season of ne'er-failing love 'Neath my unprepossessing gravity.— And that the more she condescends to trust To its perennial freshness, more and more 'Twill be exuberant e'en to th' utmost verge To which in it she may place confidence. My cold demeanour more is the result Of a superfluous fervour, which congeals, And stagnates,—forming thus an icy crust Over my heart, from never meeting with Fitting excitement for its exercise,— Than from a scant defectiveness of nature. Though in the midst of worldly happiness, I am half heart broken! One more shock, One more disruption of my sympathies, And that illusion utterly is gone, Failing in which, our most voluptuous passions, Behold, from those things which should call them forth, All their bloom fled: their beauty, freshness gone, And nothing seem they but the lifeless forms, Appalling skeletons, of what they were. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. I can but half conceive your meaning! While You thus address me, you impress me more With the conviction that you have sustained Wrongs, real or fancied, from some absent object, Rather than that a pleasure you receive From any present one. Confess, at least, There is in this your style of making love Originality; and besides this, At least, no flattery. DUKE D'ORMOND. The happy flatter, And only they! And they alone are happy Who are themselves by things or persons flattered. For there are flatteries in things as well As individuals. The best that I Can offer, is by my loquaciousness, And egotism, to afford you proof Of perfect confidence: and who confides E'en grief,—while he confides, his grief is lost. Grief that can be confiding is not grief! The real grief is voiceless, and as with it Dies all that vanity which loves to dwell On themes of self; so also, with the hope, Dies all the power, of waking sympathy. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. You're the first lover, I e'er heard of, Duke, Who chose a metaphysical tirade T'amuse a lady's private audience. This seems to me an ominous beginning; And what imports it to the present hour. DUKE D'ORMOND. Not much indeed! But to retort, I may Say, you're the first, I ever met with, lady, To whom a metaphysical tirade Would not appear misplaced: I cannot tell Whether or not confession like to this Will flatter you. But is it not to say In higher sense, converse with one is sweet, Proving that in society with her The deepest workings of a lonely mind Feel a spontaneous soliciting To unused utterance, than 'twould be to seek To amuse her ears with vapid flatteries Of beauty and of grace, whose very speech, While they her person adulate, imply Misprision of her soul? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Well:—very well! I see you men must flatter our frail sex, And perhaps then the most insidiously, When you the most ingeniously disdain All flattery. DUKE D'ORMOND. I love you lady! Love you to distraction!— But certain questionings will vex my heart Of th' influence which Courtenaye has o'er you. And then my withered, and checked impulses, Run into wild discourse. For happiness— With me it is so—is a quiet thing!— But these my words are shapings of a soul Which dallies with its woe; and throws it off In phrases strange and wild; like flowers unplucked Will, ere they quite die, to the fresh breeze give Their sere leaves, and uncultivated blooms. I cannot love you as bequest of Courtenaye. I am exacting. If I am to love Intensely, I must be intensely loved: And not intensely loved, intensely love, I care not to be loved, or love, at all! The art has Courtenaye of inflicting pain, Yet his soil aiming with such subtle skill That all its strokes are, e'en when most they wound, Unrecognizable, invisible, And unrecordable! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). With such a view Of Courtenaye's character, and 'tis methinks, Not a mistaken one, what semblance is there That he should chuse him as ambassador, To woo me as his bride? DUKE D'ORMOND. Could I suppose, E'en for an instant, that you were in league With Courtenaye, I enough should not esteem Our separation, though we severed were Far as from pole to pole. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Unlikelier still That he should Courtenaye chuse as emissary. Perhaps 'tis jealousy. Love never was Where jealousy was not. DUKE D'ORMOND. But such a thought I will not entertain! You could not give me A smile Maria—such a smile as that— If I were warranted in such suspicion. I will not think it! I will think you love me!— And though I have not sacrificed one life— Though I could wish to sacrifice a thousand For you—I will believe that you are mine As much as though the point that made you so, Of honour, had been tried in th' only way, 'Twixt Courtenaye and myself, in which such questions— At least in my opinion,—can be Decided satisfactorily. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Strange! This is very strange! The test will be If Courtenaye have or have not falsely played, When he and D'Ormond once have met. Till then I will be silent. I have given my word For this, and will not break it. This may be To prove the temper of my soul towards him Ere he my hand demand. He cannot know That Courtenaye yet has urged me on this point: If I believed he did, and thought he played A simulated part, my woman's pride Ne'er could such insult pardon.— (To the Duke). D'Ormond, you Are a strange creature!—You appoint a meeting With a fair lady; first you read to her A long, emphatic, speculative thesis, Stuffed full of metaphysic terms, and now The droit du duel is the theme you chuse! “Was ever woman in this humour wooed?— “Was ever woman in this humour won?—” At least this is original in the art Of making love. Such recipe gives Ovid To his disciples.—It appears to me As if your self-tormenting soul's perverseness Could only be allayed, or gain possession Of me on terms accordant to your taste, Could you have rescued me, as valorous knights Are said to have done, in tales of chivalry, Fair damsel, in enchanted fortress bound? Had you won me by proof of hardihood, By dint of sword, by levelling with the ground Castle or barbacan; by scaling walls, Binding discourteous paynim ravisher, Dishorsing mailed soldan with your lance, And by encountering all the prodigies, “Hair-breadth escapes in the imminent deadly breach,” Adventures, hardships, and strange accidents, We read of in romantic rhapsodies.— Thus, ere you bind the myrtle round your brow, Acquiring laurels in the field of Mars. DUKE D'ORMOND. This in one sense is true. I might compare Myself to Sampson i'th' Philistine's gripe.— Unspeakable, immitigable, is The unreconciled disgust of my whole being At the manœuvring, crooked policy, The machiavelian stratagems of Courtenaye. Yet to distraction I love you! and I Should hold myself the happiest of men Had not he been the means of making me Acquainted with you;—but by doing that— Which, when I contemplate your wondrous charms, I scarcely can, without supposing him Or more or less than man, think that he did Without some private reservation— The very greatness of the benefit, The spirit of self-sacrifice it asks, So little seem they of his temperament Spontaneous growths, their very glory feeds The whirl and tempest of suspicious thought. I know he's lax in principle; how then When that which might that of the stoutest shake, Is placed within his reach, can I believe That he, with generosity unheard of, With an unparalleled devotedness To me, can that surrender?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Think you then That I am fallen so low, so very low, That like transferrable property, I am A mere commodity at other's will? DUKE D'ORMOND. Forgive me, madam, if, e'en for an instant, My words could such interpretation bear. I speak of him, not you!—Such dark surmise— Though most ingenious in self-torturing I be,—ne'er yet presumed to glance at you: You live in brightness unapproachable By brooding and distempered jealousies; And inasmuch as of their spurious birth That brightness may be parent, just so much They fall off from you in their consequences, As vapours which the sun draws from the earth, Fall to that earth again condensed in showers, Nor dare, except to eyes which are beneath them, To cast a moment's shade upon its glory. You are that sun, these fogs and mists of passion, Which you have raised in me, attaint you not, They but accite to their tribunal dim, The prejudiced, the earthy qualities Of your idolaters. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Ingeniously, Yes, most ingeniously have you, Duke, found A clue by which to extricate yourself From your perplexity. I never knew Before—but I suppose 'tis love that gives it— That you with such address were gifted. DUKE D'ORMOND. Hear me.— When contemplating you my thoughts appear Suspicions rather than realities, Which, to the soul sick with excess of bliss, And insufficient to endure its transports, Suggest that its powers are not infinite; And that there must be somewhat to remind Us of the imperfection of our nature E'en in the very ecstasy of joy.— In short, Maria, when I look on you, These fancies seem the questionings alone To the soul incident, when ushered first To bliss, beneath the which its nature totters, From having to its deep intensity Been unaccustomed. May they not be likened, As to recriminations, and revenges, Of our mortality and finiteness, When our immortal energies assert Their right to grasp at, having found means of, Immortal happiness. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR (aside). Oh, how I am Unworthy to awaken the affections Of a nature like to this. The time has been— But, ah, that time is past redemption gone. (To the Duke). If by self-questioning you are perplexed, What must I be? We—both of us— But you in far less measure than myself— Have somewhat to remind us we are mortal, And thence imperfect. Yet may not the thought That each the other's feeling comprehends, Each sympathizes with the imperfections And all the sufferings thence entailed on each;— Participation of imperfectness If unaccompanied by vanity— To a nearer union lead, than when two minds Proudly aloof each from the other stand Like fortresses impregnable, both wrapped In self-complacency? Especially May not this be the case, where suffering Is, on the part of the beloved one, Not in proportion to delinquency, But rather wholly is the bitter fruit Of an excessive sensibility, Which gives, in such a case, a power to wound To that delinquency, which, in no other, Without that tremulous sensibility It could possess. DUKE D'ORMOND. Oh, Marchioness, you are My better angel! In this cordial grasp May all my splenetic, repining thoughts, For ever be forgotten. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. How can I Better to-night withdraw myself from you Than by a fervent joining in this wish. [Exit Marchioness. [Enter Courtenaye, unseen by the Duke, by the door opposite to the one by which the Marchioness has withdrawn, and who is supposed to have been waiting for her departure]. COURTENAYE (aside). Now will I take him in the melting mood; Nor will I gradually, but with abrupt Promptness, will hurry him, ere he have time For thought, into this snare I've laid for him. (To the Duke). I've a proposal now to make to you.— The Marchioness de Mielcour and yourself Will ne'er be happy till you both are joined In ties indissoluble; you and she,— The noble-minded Mielcour! I am so Convinced of this, and further so convinced That by affording you facilities For this close union, I best proved to you My faithful love, further was so convinced That you, with your procrastinating spirit,— With your—what shall I call it?—dalliance with Absolute purposes, arising from A melancholy mood of mind, from griefs, Which, though to me you never have divulged them, I, not the less, am sure prey on your heart:— And of their nature too I've a shrewd guess.— DUKE D'ORMOND. Come! To the point. Why all these ambages?— A plain tale ever may be plainly told.— You touch a tender part! What is your drift?— COURTENAYE. This then,—that, for the reasons I've expressed, And others not expressed,—and, hark ye, with The Marchioness' consent,—she knows it all;— I have a priest procured, who waits hard by, E'en in the anti-chamber, to perform, Betwixt De Mielcour and yourself, the rite Of holy matrimony! But hark! she thinks, That this request originates in you.— I ventured on this stratagem to save A woman's blushes. Therefore, pray you, see Not to betray the innocent artifice To which I was led by deep interest in The welfare of you both.— [The Duke walks backwards and forwards as in deep thought. While he does this, Courtenaye thus soliloquizes.] 'Tis true the Marchioness knows this:—and let Him think that it with her originates. I brought the priest, and still the will in me To her consent was father. What of this?— If he suppose it had from her its birth 'Twill bind him faster to consummate it. He cannot be so recreant a gallant As when a lady (as he thinks she's done) Provides him with an instrument on purpose To join her hands with his, as to refuse To accomplish that, which she, with complaisance So flattering to his vanity, has planned. DUKE D'ORMOND (returning). It shall be as you wish. Call the priest in. COURTENAYE. He's now conferring with the Marchioness. (Aside). The blow must now be struck, or all is lost. No time for conference shall they have. For, D'Ormond, Thy soul's the very nursery of doubt. She may have scruples too. (To the Duke). The priest is here. Come let us join him. DUKE D'ORMOND. Well.—It shall be so. [Exeunt. END OF ACT THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIFTH ACT. SCENE THE FIRST. Discovering the Duke D'Ormond asleep on a sofa, the Marchioness de Mielcour seated near him with a harp, on which she plays a short air. (The Duke starting vehemently from the sofa. The Marchioness rises to meet him, and catches him in her arms). DUKE D'ORMOND. 'TIS she! 'tis she! Do not you see her there?— [The Marchioness looks about, then again turns to the Duke.] DUKE D'ORMOND. Dead! Julia! dead! No! I will not believe it: This is the very coinage of my brain! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. What ails you, Duke? Speak, dearest D'Ormond, speak! Why are your eyes so fixed? and why do you To one part of the room so earnestly Direct your looks? There is nothing to be seen There more than usual. DUKE D'ORMOND. Dead, and living! both At once! It is a fearful sight! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Explain Yourself: for heaven's sake, do! DUKE D'ORMOND. That voice! That voice!— Is it not altered? 'Tis not as it should be! Julia! [Looking at the Marchioness, and then suddenly turning from her.] Why take that shape, that damned shape! Speak; I conjure thee, speak; but in the tones Of thy own voice, of thy own natural voice. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. D'Ormond! DUKE D'ORMOND (stopping his ears). Oh, scream not thus! Oh, fiend of hell, What art thou? What?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Maria, thy Maria!— Thy own beloved Maria! Is so soon The memory of those rapturous hours effaced, Which, ere into this inauspicious sleep You fell, we had together passed? DUKE D'ORMOND. We! We! What, you and I? Off, off! I know you not! Why take that damned shape? If you are Julia, Why not appear to me in Julia's form?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. D'Ormond, you're ill! Yes, you are very ill. I pray you let me send for some assistance. DUKE D'ORMOND (with a bitter smile). Ill? yes, I am ill! I begin to feel Very ill! It has been a dream! But oh, Such an one, as, with which, not to have been Troubled, I would life's forfeiture have held— E'en were that life a thousand times more worth Than mine is,—a cheap compromise!— Sit down By me, Maria! I begin to know you Now! [Again looking towards the place on which he had so earnestly, and so frequently gazed.] Is she there? I seem to see her yet!— There! [Pointing to the place.] (To the Marchioness). You remember what I said to you Last night, of Julia? Nay, start not! Be calm. Look not at me so! Be calm, very calm. For I my senses feel o'th' very brink Of alienation! Be calm, very calm! You recollect that which I said of Julia?— Listen, and keep that in your mind! I dreamed That thou in a delicious paradise, And I, together wandered. Round us breathed Strains of the most entrancing harmony!— We seemed like blessed immortals newly winged. As if reflecting back the happiness, Calm, and intense at once that filled us both, Forms both inanimate and animate Of beauty sprung, where'er we bent our gaze. At once, a feeling of reality, Was, as respected these forms, given to us, And, to the other, each allowed, and we Had a sense lent to us, as (in subservience To our delight, and from the agency Of our own wills) started to sudden birth This wonderful assemblage of rich shapes. Gardens, and plants of amaranthine bloom, Bloom such as Eden only saw, conceived Alone, by such as dwell in paradise. Unfading bowers, and trees of lofty size, Umbrageous, rich in leaves, and flowers, and fruits; Immortal streams of living crystal!—founts Of pure and everlasting copiousness.— And gorgeous palaces, pavilion-like, Meet temples e'en for gods. To crown all these Seraphic forms, such as the eye ne'er saw; Seraphic voices, such as ear ne'er heard! Seraphic smiles, such as would win to love A heart where fellest hate had fixed its seat. A fervid light, intense, yet pure and holy, Like a blessed halo, our transfigur'd forms Enveloped. Thou and I wandered at will In this delicious paradise! Love, deep, Calm, permeating, cheerful, yet sublime, Like that of innocent, adoring spirits Transporting, ardent, yet accompanied With the most perfect self-tranquillity, The soul of each possessed. At once the scene All changed! unutterable darkness now Surrounded us. The atmosphere became Clammy, pitch-like, and close, and nothing now Was visible, except, from time to time, When corruscations lurid and sulphureous, Revealed to us, such mansions of dismay, Such scenes of horror, as in ghastliness Outstripped e'en any of those which the bard Of Florence, or that greater British son Of song immortal, have so well pourtrayed. Chasms, yawning chasms; clouds both thunder-voiced, And black as Erebus; bickerings horrible Of light unnatural; now of yellow, dun And tawny, now of fiercest lurid red. Unutterable groans, and yells, and screams; Lakes of bitumen, and of weltering pitch, Emitting a sulphureous fetidness Even to suffocation: these, and such As these, the objects were that smote our senses.— In one, the blackest interval of darkness, Betwixt the corruscations I described I suddenly perceived that, by my side, You were no more; since, when I called on you, No longer you made answer to my call, As you had heretofore. Into a vast Interminable desert, in an instant, Of polar ice and snow was metamorphosed This chaos of infernal images; Rugged,—abrupt,—ice-cliff on ice-cliff piled, And nought beside, into the firmament Started around me! Dense and noisome fog, O'er the whole brooded! Such a yellow fog As, in the winter oft o'ercanopies Some vast metropolis! and when the eye, On the monotonous and wintry waste With gazing tired, its speculation fixed Where rolled (in solemn masses ocean-like, Billowy and multitudinous as its waves) Volumes of vapour, 'twas in canopy, Though moving, yet impenetrable, lost!— The only thing worse to endure than sight Of the unbounded solitude around me On every side, were—e'en to fearfulness— To awful, unexpressive fearfulness— The sentiment of mental solitude That, at the same time, was on me impressed; With such a sense of cold, such corse-like cold, As I had been a petrifaction, yet To life, and thought inexorably chained. For some short space this lasted. Presently I, as it were, heard th' utterance of my name. It seemed as if it were “a wandering voice” That floated in the air. No where it was, Yet every where; nor was it more allied To form, than 'twas to place. I afterwards Near to the base of fissure in a cliff Of ice, espied an aperture, that had The semblance of the entrance to a cave. Thither my steps instinctively were urged. When I had entered it, the fissure seemed More narrow; and that—which externally Had had appearance, from the top o'th' cliff To the bottom, of continuous separation; Now o'er my head was arched! and at the end Of a long narrow avenue, to which The vision but imperfectly extended, A light gleam, which, as I had now advanced Further, than to receive a benefit From the murky twilight of the solitude I'd left, was, to this vault's extremity My only guide! Onward I went, and what Was my surprize, when I came to the end Of this ice-fretted passage, to behold Roofed, walled with ice, and with ten thousand cressets Of crystalline transparency illumed, A circular magnificent apartment. At the far end of this, on gorgeous couch, Or sofa, on an area placed, to which By steps of ice, transparent, you ascend, Beneath a canopy profusely decked With festooned curtains, and rich drapery, Luxuriant from its amplitude of folds, Of gossamery lightness, I saw you, Maria, seated in immortal beauty. You beckoned me to you with all that grace Of earnestness, with delicacy temper'd, Which is your own peculiar attribute.— Forward I rushed to clasp you in my arms. A crash, as of the loudest thunder, smote My ear! The whole scene vanished! and I saw, In the same place in which I saw her last, Julia, a corse, in my embrace. I did Maria! But thou art not she? My brain Is all on fire! Is not she there? Art thou A vision or reality? If thou Be a reality, come to my arms! Is not she there? SCENE THE SECOND. Duke D'Ormond, Marchioness de Mielcour, Julia, Courtenaye, and Despard. [Enter to the Duke, and the Marchioness, silently, and from behind a folding screen, which intercepts the sight of them from the two first named persons, to the very spot where the Duke fancied that he had seen Julia, Julia herself, Courtenaye, and Despard.] DUKE D'ORMOND (to the Marchioness). DOST thou not see her there?— [Hides his face with his hands. Julia meanwhile feels overcome: she makes an effort to dart forward to the Duke, and sinks at his feet. A long silence and general embarrassment ensue. At last, as the Marchioness perceives that the Duke remains fixed in his posture, clenching his hands over his eyes, and Julia almost motionless on the ground, though once or twice she raises her eyes with somewhat of an appealing look to the Duke, and as the Marchioness begins to guess who she is, she beckons to Courtenaye and Despard to assist her in removing either the Duke or Julia to another room: but though these gentlemen wish to restrain Julia so far as to prevent her and the Duke from understanding each other, and therefore are anxious to keep her in a sort of side play with themselves, and are alarmed at the present crisis, when she had, as it were, escaped from their grasp, yet as the project of the Marchioness would utterly defeat their schemes, they affect not to understand her.] MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR, (To Courtenaye). One,—one of them remove! Let him not see her. COURTENAYE (aside to Despard). Not see her!—But he shall!— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR, Look, look at him! At her!—Ye wretches, it appears to you A feast,—this spectacle of misery! [While she speaks, Julia, looking up, without changing her kneeling or recumbent posture, slowly and gently raises one hand, and is about to take that of the Duke.] DUKE D'ORMOND (starting). Touch me not! touch me not! Touch not pollution. JULIA, (Casting a fearful gaze around the room, towards the Marchioness, and Courtenaye, and Despard). Ill is he? Are ye not his friends? MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. He is Very ill, madam. And as I infer From your deportment, that himself and you Have been ere now acquainted, and since deep May be the interest you feel for him, And he for you, I do entreat of you Now to withdraw into another room, Or with these gentlemen, or me, as he Is far too ill now to be taxed with conflict. JULIA. D'Ormond! 'Tis Julia now addresses you; Do you not know her voice? If but one word, I do conjure you, speak. DUKE D'ORMOND. Am I in hell?— Off, off! terrific vision!— COURTENAYE (aside to Despard). Yes, it works,— The poison works as we could wish it. JULIA, (Looking fearfully towards Maria). Has he Been long ill, madam? I entreat of you This mystery to unravel. I cannot Thus leave him. DUKE D'ORMOND. But you shall! Some one must leave me. I am beset, haunted, tormented!—No! No, no!—It is myself that haunt myself!— I am myself my own fierce tormentor!— Angelic creature! MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR, (Seizing Julia by the wrist, and making an effort to separate her from D'Ormond). Madam, come with me. Let us withdraw. COURTENAYE, (Going up to Despard, and pointing to Julia). Do you say something to her. No matter what it is, so it be done With air of an established intercourse. DESPARD. I understand you! Thank you for the hint. [Despard goes up to Julia, and affects to speak in her ear with the familiarity of an old friend.] COURTENAYE, (Now going up to D'Ormond). Be more a man! [Pointing to Despard and Julia.] You see who she is with. What? Break your heart for mistress of another! DUKE D'ORMOND. Curse on thy tongue! Surely all hell is turned Loose upon me!—This am I to endure!— (To Julia). False woman, quit my sight!—For ever quit My sight!—For ever be thou banished!— (To the Marchioness.) Here!— Here my sole haven is of lasting peace. Let us retire. [He embraces the Marchioness, and then retires with her.] COURTENAYE, (To Julia, who advances, though hesitatingly, to follow the Duke). Nay, madam, stay here! You See he is ill. If you will be more calm, I will repair to him, and bring you word Of his condition. JULIA. Nay, but I will follow. COURTENAYE. If you provoke me thus, so it must be!— I must command here! Despard, you assist To move this lady to another place. [They each take a hand of Julia, and forcibly drag her out of the room.] (The Marchioness re-entering, followed by the Duke D'Ormond). MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. What noise was that? They're gone!— DUKE D'ORMOND. Could I believe this? That Julia! That angelic, spotless Julia; To come, with her unhallowed paramour, To insult me to my face?—But stop, perchance, This is but the fulfilment of my dream. This what was meant by her prefigured death! For now she's dead to me, quite dead! Can I Believe this to be so?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Believe this? No!— Look at her face, and you cannot believe it!— Hear her speak once, and you cannot believe it! Her gestures see, and you cannot believe it. There must be some mistake! I did not know She was in Paris: never heard her name Either by Courtenaye or by Despard mentioned. And yet a confidential intercourse 'Twixt her and Despard seems establish'd. DUKE D'ORMOND. No!— It is not possible! The universe, If she no longer virtuous prove herself Is but a splendid system of imposture. (Enter Courtenaye). COURTENAYE. Galling enough!—Here Despard and I brought His mistress here, thinking by this to set Your mind at ease: thinking that seeing thus How the affair stood 'twixt him, and that lady Without compunction, and without reserve, You might the more resign yourself to love, To pleasure, and this lady. Thus it is:— Whenever you most try to serve your friends, You oft produce effects quite opposite To those which you wish to achieve, by some Unlucky contre tems or blunder. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Still The interview was very ill-advised, Just at this moment. So abrupt! so sudden! COURTENAYE (aside to the Marchioness). Hush! Hush! I have my reasons! But not now. Another time I will explain them. DUKE D'ORMOND. Have I in the world a friend? Realities Are th' individuals round me, or the mere Coinage of my distempered brain? Alas, Nought seems to go on as 'twas wont to do. No man's deportment longer seems to me Spontaneous or befitting. I could fancy That every one around me played a part; And that I, as designed to be their victim, Am the only one, of motives ignorant Which actuate the agents I observe, In one conspiracy 'gainst me. COURTENAYE. Tush, tush!— A truce with your self-teazing phantasies! Your pretty country mistress, innocent, Religious, dutiful, although she seemed, Has only, in the end, turned out to be, What all such paragons of excellence Are, a mere flirt, and hypocrite.—For you,— 'Tis well you have, in time, the truth discovered!— [A violent scream is heard from the next apartment.] JULIA (within). I will—yes—I will see him! Though I must Die at his feet. [The Duke D'Ormond goes up to the door through which Julia had been dragged by Courtenaye and Despard, and finds it locked.] DUKE D'ORMOND. Who—who has dared do this?— There's treachery here. Open this door, or I Will burst the lock. JULIA (from within). D'Ormond! DUKE D'ORMOND. Oh, let me hear Your voice! [While the Duke is endeavouring to force the door, Courtenaye skulks behind him and unlocks it, but not unperceived by the Marchioness.] MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Miserable villain! In my house such freedoms!— [The Duke brings in Julia, who looks wildly about the room, and is apparently quite unconscious of the objects near her.] JULIA. Was this well done? Here, here I came alone! My mother I have buried! There, there, there, [Pointing to the ground.] I laid her there! Her coffin I beheld As it sunk slow in earth! The creaking ropes I heard, as gradually it disappeared! The earth and stones I also heard, as they Were on its surface cast! But then I thought Of D'Ormond! Else, I should have fainted! Oh! It was a wicked thought! DUKE D'ORMOND. Julia! My love?— Julia. JULIA. That voice! Before I've listened to it!— And it was silver sweet! Oft in my dreams I have heard it! Ah! then sleep to me was welcome! But Julia never now must slumber more! DUKE D'ORMOND. Demons of hell! Behold, what have you done! (To Julia, leading her to a sofa). Sit, sit,—my love! My blessed Julia, 'tis D'Ormond who speaks to you! See, see—he kneels Before you! (To the Marchioness, who seems much affected.) Come here! you have yet, at least, I see, a woman-hearted feeling. Help me!— Try to recal her wandering thoughts. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Indeed I would do any thing, sir, every thing! My heart bleeds both for you, and for this lady. (To Courtenaye and Despard). For you, ye wretches, it were honouring you Too much, to waste a curse upon you. [The Marchioness advances towards Julia, and in endeavouring to cause her to recline on some of the cushions of the sofa, which, for that purpose, she had previously piled at one end of it, as Julia's posture is changed, a miniature which is fastened round her neck, and which was concealed in her bosom, escapes from its confinement; Courtenaye, who, with Despard, is looking over the back of the sofa, appears much struck with it, and fixes his eyes intently upon it.] COURTENAYE. 'Tis, By all the saints, my mother! This must be Her picture! What may be this lady's name?— JULIA. That voice is gone! Where am I? Round and round My head whirls! Hark! What horrid voice is that I hear? Speak—speak—say would ye murder me?— Alone, unfriended, on his love relying, Did I not come here? But I have been used Most vilely. Into wicked hands I've fallen!— They told me he was false, another loved!— Meanwhile confiding, trusting in his truth, And her own innocence, she cast herself, Yes, his poor Julia, she cast herself Into this populous city, and here,—here,— Have I insulted been. DUKE D'ORMOND. My Julia! Julia!— It is thine own dear D'Ormond. JULIA. Yes! I know it!— I know thy voice now! I am well, quite well!— DUKE D'ORMOND. Oh ecstacy! Ah Julia!—my own Julia!— JULIA. Ah D'Ormond! What I've suffered you know not!— My mother! my dear mother!— DUKE D'ORMOND. What of her?— [Julia hides her face in her handkerchief. D'Ormond now first observes her mourning garments, and the miniature lying in her bosom.] DUKE D'ORMOND. Ah, spare your words! She is—I understand you— These mourning weeds.— COURTENAYE, (Who all this time had been lost in amazement and curiosity). Her name? What is her name?— DUKE D'ORMOND. Whose name? Why are you thus inquisitive?— COURTENAYE. This lady's mother's! Her's whose portrait here This lady honours thus. DUKE D'ORMOND. Her name is Villeneuve. She is the daughter of my father's sister! COURTENAYE. Almighty God, she is my sister! ALL, (Excepting Julia, whose countenance resumes all its bewilderment, and becomes expressive of relapsing insanity). Yours!— Your sister?— COURTENAYE. Yes, my name by birth is Villeneuve! Though I have changed it for another. She My sister is. JULIA (starting wildly from the sofa). Who talked of sister? No! No, no! 'Tis D'Ormond that I want. I have No brother, mother, friend!—I have lost all. DUKE D'ORMOND (to Courtenaye). Be on your guard! See what you've done! Do you, Marchioness, draw him hence. [The Marchioness beckons Courtenaye apart; they walk towards the interior of the apartment, Despard hanging on their rear.] JULIA. Is it then come To this? For him I kept myself alive!— When I have watched, daily, and hourly watched, The dying look, and the decaying form, Of my revered, and venerable mother; And when I recollected that I had, When she went, not a friend on earth, I should Have also died had I not thought of D'Ormond. He is to Julia the whole universe!— And the whole universe speaks, breathes of nought To her, but him! Sometimes, I think I see him, But it is only in a shadowy dream, Which, with the semblance of reality, But mocks me! No, 'twixt him and me, there is Fixed an impassable gulph! I feel it here. Here—here! [Putting her hand alternately to her head and her heart.] (To the Duke, who makes an attempt to speak to her). Do not look so at me! Talk not To me! You only mock me! You are like, But you are not the same. DUKE D'ORMOND, (Still supporting Julia, but turning aside to that part of the room where the Marchioness is). Do one of you Come here, and take my place! I cannot bear it!— Each word she utters stabs my very vitals! E'en worse than she herself soon shall I be! [The Marchioness advances to support Julia, with a look of the deepest concern and sympathy.] JULIA, (As she approaches, and as the Duke is about to disengage himself from her). Off—off—no one shall touch me but himself. (To the Duke). You should be D'Ormond! But you are not he! My once beloved D'Ormond! There's a likeness!— And for that likeness' sake, no one of you Shall touch me but himself. I love you e'en For that resemblance! But the real D'Ormond And Julia must be wedded in the grave!— Fearful thoughts have I!—fearful visions! DUKE D'ORMOND. Hell, Canst thou have agonies surpassing this!— Julia, my Julia, my own Julia!— Oh, God of mercy, straining to my heart, Here am I, all that that heart most adores! But I have made a sacrifice of her!— And now, although our forms be intertwined, An insurmountable impediment Is raised between us!—We no longer live In the same world!— JULIA (catching his last words). Oh, but we do! There is No world for me to live in where he is not!— In every beating of my heart he lives!— But soft—bad thoughts will peradventure rise When one, like me, is ill. [Disengaging her hand.] About a knife, I think, I somewhat recollect! There was A mad girl, who lived near my mother's house, Who had a knife, a wicked knife!— [Putting her hand in her pocket.] You look Kind, and as if you fain would serve me. Keep, I pray you, this! Keep it for my poor sake! [Giving him a knife.] They say a knife is an unlucky gift!— But ah, what gift of mine would not be so?— Now pray keep that, and think of me! This picture, I cannot part with that! or I would give That to you also! No, no, that must be Buried with me! Here! For my sake, keep these! [Producing a few trinkets, and a worked handkerchief, and giving the former to the Duke.] That handkerchief was formerly designed For D'Ormond, as a fond memorial! See, How carefully I have embroidered it!— Here, with my hair, are his initials marked. [Bursts into a flood of tears.] MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. These tears! Grant heaven they might relieve her! What Wretches, good God, are we! Trifling away In inconsiderate and unmeaning passions, (To say the best of them, we cannot give To them a higher epithet) our time, While this divine, self-sacrificing creature, Little by little, and uncomforted, Was dying our unconscious victim. When I think of it, I hate myself to loathing. DESPARD (to Courtenaye). Well acted, on my honour! If she turn Preacher, who says that miracles have ceased? COURTENAYE (to Despard). Hold that blaspheming tongue of thine! This is An hour for cursing rather than such mummery! [Julia, who has continued weeping all this time, now casts a look of ineffable sweetness for a moment towards D'Ormond.] DUKE D'ORMOND. Beloved creature! Look thou ever thus! This is thy D'Ormond! Come, sit down again!— Try to be tranquil! All will yet be well. (Turning to the Marchioness). This lady will to you be as a sister!— Maria, will you not?— MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Oh, that I were Worthy of that!—I am for life her convert!— A name for me more suited than the other! COURTENAYE. What canting have we here? We may as well Go hang ourselves. DESPARD. Aye, hang, drown, poison, shoot;— Or any thing methinks! What think you now Of your manœuvring? COURTENAYE. Think? I am too mad To think! I'm quite sick of the part I take!— That's all I know! JULIA. This, this is the true D'Ormond!— Now is our bridal hour come. I engaged I would be true to you! See, see, from earth He rises! To the skies he beckons me.— Ah, this is he indeed! He is but gone Before me; and invites me to his arms!— My love is not a love of mortal mould!— He is a blessed, ethereal spirit! Now!— This is the hour! I hear his voice! I come! D'Ormond I come! Of everlasting union Thus I invoke the sacramental pledge! [Sinks down on her knees. The Duke and the Marchioness each rush forward towards her, she faints; and while the curtain slowly falls, they bear her, in a state of insensibility, out of the apartment.] SCENE THE THIRD. Courtenaye and Despard. COURTENAYE. WAS not this nobly done? A man to turn Pander to his own sister? DESPARD. I am all Amazement! Solve this riddle to me. Is Courtenaye your name or not? Say, have you been Making fools of us for the last four years, Or are you making now? Though, to speak truth, You seem predestined of yourself to make The greatest fool. COURTENAYE. Listen, Despard, to me; And cease thy stupid wonder! Villeneuve is My real name! I am brother to this lady; Son to the sister, and the only sister, (Brother or sister none had he besides) Of the Duke D'Ormond's father: though of this The Duke had no suspicion. Little wealth To me my father at his death bequeathed. He was a hugenot: under pretence Of heresy, of his fair patrimony By far the greater part was confiscate To the omnivorous rapaciousness Of superstitious hypocrites and bigots. But as my mother's brother, the Duke's father, Lived single till advanced in years, and since There were no heirs in the male line, I was Believed to be, till I was ten years old, My uncle's heir. Thus learned I to abhor Whoever might fill up the vacant niche, With its appurtenances, doomed one day, As I was flattered to expect, and hoped, On myself to devolve.—The Duke and I Both were at the same school; though younger, he But two years came to, ere I quitted, it:— And subsequently college comrades were we. Thus by the relative circumstance, at first, Of both our houses, the Duke's wealthy, while My own, its equal in pretensions, was Impoverish'd, then by D'Ormond's birth, and lastly By his pre-eminence, were frustrated, Nay, strangled in the cradle which had nurs'd them, My high ambition, and aspiring hopes!— I came to Paris, pedant rules abjured, And buckled to my thigh th' adventurous sword, Hoping by force to win those smiles of fortune, Which to my blood, and talents were denied.— But strong solicitings of appetite Here made myself my own antagonist, As much as in the earlier scenes of life My kinsman so had been. Why weary you With a long tale?—Desire exceeded means; And love of pleasure, pleasure's subsidies. My father died, the little that from him I gathered, in usurious practices Had long time been forestalled. Bankrupt was I In hope as well as fortune. I applied To a friend, my father when a bachelor Had had, who since that time had fixed himself On the vast transatlantic continent.— My friends then living, nothing of him knew. He too unwedded was. He had acquired Vast wealth, yet had no one with whom to share it. He flattered my appeal, invited me To seek a home with him. I quitted France— My friends no longer tidings of me hearing Conjectured I was dead; and to confirm This thought, I framed a tale, committing it To such a channel as I knew would bring it To them, establishing beyond all doubt, This fact already rumoured and believed. My father's youthful comrade welcom'd me With hospitality: after a ten years' tarriance under his roof, he died, left me his wealth, With the sole stipulation that henceforth I, in addition to my own, should bear, With its appurtenant blazonries, his name. The effect of ten years' tarriance in a clime, With manners foreign, had been such, that I Conceived no fears, should I return to France, Than any in my visnomy or person, A comrade of past times should recognise. I came to Paris. Never once did I Ask tidings of my mother or my sister. As for the latter, fifteen years was she Younger than I; and as she still had leaned— From a more strict accordancy of tastes In part, with more accordancy of years,— To closer intercourse with my uncle's son Than with myself, she of the hate partook I bore to him. With wealth to cope with it, My earlier love returned of costly pastimes. Added to this, I had acquired, since first I left my native land,—so filling up My oft recurring intervals of leisure— A taste for hazardous stakes at games of chance. When the Duke hither came, once more was I A ruined man! I hated him as much As ever:—felt no fear that he in me Would recognise a kinsman and a rival!— Leagued with the Marchioness de Mielcour, Believing that his coffers groaned with wealth,— You know the rest—I formed a scheme, through her, Or so to make a bankrupt of his mind,— Knowing his strict tenaciousness of conscience— And knowing too how wayward are his passions— Through her I formed a scheme—by making her The means of his launching his eager bark From the sure pilotage of virtuous love— To engulph him in destruction, first of soul, And then of body! Or if this should fail, At least by having made him with himself At war, knowing how prone his nature is To crave excitement, thence to draw him on Into th' inextricable toils and snares Which wait all novices in games of chance; From whence I trusted that my elder skill Might disencumber his inheritance Of its redundant superfluity. You see how far my projects have matured! E'en as all mine have done! to pieces dashed, Just as they seemed for consummation fit! And now am I at my wit's end, to know How from this labyrinth to make escape. DESPARD. You are indeed, man, in your own snares caught! Help you—who can! Not I!—I wash my hands Of the whole stratagem. COURTENAYE. Curses on such Cold-blooded villany! But, hark you, Despard, If I must be exposed, as semblably I shall be, you (as you have not refused To share in the contingent benefits To this scheme tacked) shall not, I promise you, In case of its miscarriage, be exempt From being partner in its obloquy. [A scream is heard from the apartment within: the door bursts open, and Julia, her hair loose, and in a night dress, rushes in to Courtenaye and Despard, followed by the Duke D'Ormond, Physician, and the Marchioness de Mielcour.] JULIA. Is't so? They say he lives! did I not see him?— Did he not beckon to me from the skies?— Immortal was he, radiant, unearthly!— And now they tell me that 'twas all a dream!— (Going up to Courtenaye). Did not you mention make to me erewhile About a sister?—I no brother have! Oh, could I but believe in any thing!— But all seems shadowy; all forms indistinct, And changing every moment! Even now Your face puts on a thousand different aspects. Let me at something grasp! I'm falling—falling— The very firm-set earth seems to give way Under my feet! PHYSICIAN. This must not be allowed!— This lady must be quiet, or there is No chance the anodyne we have administered Will prove effectual. If this lady be Not tranquillized, and speedily, I fear Greatly the end of this. JULIA. Fear, said you? What Fear you? You all have driven me to this!— And now pretend astonishment, nay, pity.— It is too late for that! Who pitied me Alone and unprotected? I have been The very mark for insult to exhaust On me all possible atrocities.— And now you pity me! I smile at this. Let me be quiet. Quietness I ask!— There is but one place where I can indulge That wish—the grave! Oh, look thou down, look down, On thy abused, and broken-hearted daughter, My sainted mother!—But I cannot pray!— No, no, a cold hand presses on my heart, As if its very beatings it would stifle!— I know by your looks that you think me mad! No, no! I am not mad! I yet distinguish 'Twixt foes and friends; as proof of it, here—here Will I take up my everlasting rest!— [She rushes into the arms of the Duke D'Ormond; while he endeavours to press her to his bosom, her knees faulter, she slips through his arms, and dies at his feet.] SCENE THE LAST. Inside of a Monastery: the coffin of Julia covered with a velvet pall, and tapers burning around it. The Marchioness de Mielcour, habited in deep mourning, bending over the coffin. MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR, (After a pause.) YOU I renounce henceforth for ever, Love, Pleasure, ambition! See here—what a wreck Your sophistries have wrought, ye that would plead For the unchecked indulgence of your passions, Under pretence that they instinctive are, And thence legitimate, in human breasts:— Only since natural, legitimate!— Myself do I abhor! 'Tis true, I cannot A whining, canting, penitent become. The penance of coarse garments, homely fare, Fasting, and maceration, tedious vigils Consumed in prayer, and solitary gloom; Nay, that of the most rigid order which Of discipline monastic has e'er yet Been instituted, e'en though solitude, And everlasting silence, it involved, Would be to me no penance! Mine shall be Of deeper dye! I will consent to live To be an object for “the hand of scorn To point her slowly moving finger at.” Mine being yet rank, opulence, and power, In others I may yet alleviate woe. My future life shall now be dedicate To this resolve, renouncing utterly The sources e'en of virtuous sympathy, If chance I might enjoy them; though I fear Rather must I now lie in wait for them, Than hope that they will come spontaneously: And though I be fallen, yet not fallen so low As to accept of that beneath a mask, Which is of worth but as 'tis genuine. (Kneeling before the coffin of Julia). Dear saint, thou art no more! awful indeed Hath been the sacrifice, which hath produced This revolution in my character. Yet deign thou, from the mansions of the blest, Not only to attend to, but record, The vow, (and pledge be for its strict performance) Which now I make, to consecrate to thee, And to thy memory, every future hour: On earth to represent thee! Not, oh no! In uncontaminated purity, In native innocence, and fervent zeal Of adoration! That can never be! But still as a self-sacrificing spirit, To copy thee in thy beneficence, In thy devotedness of character! Although no masses, no meet obsequies, Were celebrated for thy soul's repose, Yet, from thy ashes, in my heart shall spring A sacrificial flame of charity, To which (thus prostrating myself before The narrow mansion which containeth all That now remains of thee) I make a vow Most solemnly to consecrate each deed, And future thought. She is no more! No more The vain, ambitious, proud Maria lives!— Even as thou art, Julia, is she dead!— And her transformed self but consents to dwell On this earth as a delegate to thee!— Till after years spent in the deep abasement Of never shunned, and ever cleaving shame, She may be fit to commune with thy spirit In scenes where tears are wiped from every eye. [As she is slowly rising, the Duke D'Ormond enters. Both he and the Marchioness stand for some time, without looking at each other, intently gazing on the coffin.] MARCHIONESS DE MIELCOUR. Words were superfluous here! were sacrilege! Till to the earth that coffin be consigned To endure your presence I consent: that done, Our separation must be everlasting. DUKE D'ORMOND. To-morrow, I, in company with Colville, Quit, for America, my native land; Having long had the purpose to go thither, He, with a portion of his patrimony, Made change for grant of lands from government, In the most inaccessible retreats Which France holds in that mighty continent. And, all preliminaries now arranged, His scheme is ripe for final execution. My days I mean to end with Colville there, Distant from former scenes, in solitude, Unsolaced, unconversing solitude:— Or at least inasmuch so, as respects The gay, the frivolous, the fortunate; The multitude of the common file of men; Those human beings whose hearts have not been Seered by th' hot iron of calamity, Guilt, and remorse! Let us, Maria, take Our last farewell, kneeling once more before The narrow mansion where poor Julia lies. [They kneel before the coffin. As the Duke D'Ormond and the Marchioness de Mielcour, after a solemn pause, severally retire in different directions to remote parts of the apartment, Count Colville and Le Charier enter, unseen by, and not seeing them.] COUNT COLVILLE, (approaching the coffin). And this is all that I could do for thee, Thou ill-requited victim! This the sad, The latest sacrifice to social ties, That I shall pay ere I for ever quit My native land! In all this pomp of death, I seem to see again the obsequies Of my beloved wife! Little thought I, When I, but yesternight, in my own house Conversed with her, and at the hour of noon Promised a second interview to-day, That such would be our meeting! Yet I have Cause to congratulate myself that I Knew by her means, that she in Paris was. Thus, when I found her not, where she had fixed To meet me, to Duke D'Ormond's house I went. He was not there. By diligent inquiry I traced him to the Marchioness de Mielcour's, Just as the dire catastrophe had chanced. So little here was Julia known; so deep, And violent was Duke D'Ormond's agony, And that which pierced the Marchioness, perchance, Had it not been for me, she might have lost Those honours, and commemorative rites Due to her rank, and exemplary virtue, Though they were both by poverty eclipsed.— I interceded with this sisterhood, To let her corse be hither borne, and now I here repair, (while, with thy presence, thou Dost countenance, and dost assist, to add Meet reverence to it) when a solemn dirge Is to be chanted o'er her mortal relics. [As Count Colville concludes, a solemn chaunting is heard from a distance. The organ strikes up; a procession of Nuns enters, preceded by the Abbess, and the Duke D'Ormond and the Marchioness de Mielcour fall into its rear.] COUNT COLVILLE. But see, the sisterhood advances! Hark: The organ's solemn peal! Take we our part In this last act of holy reconcilement To an untimely death: an act, as we Would fain believe, both to the dead and living Mutually fraught and interchangeably With sweet forgiveness, and religious love! The Dirge is here performed. I. HEAR, oh God! our solemn prayer!— Here is sorrow, not despair. Here a virgin victim lies, An unconscious sacrifice!— Blighted by the world's cold scorn, Like a flower in April born, Which having sprung up all too frail To bear retiring winter's gale, Ere it could display its pride, Tempest-stricken, drooped and died. II. Bounteous God, of whom we trust, That thou in mercy ever dost Chastise the creatures thou hast made, May, from the tomb where she is laid, Such a spirit spring, and seize Those whose unhallowed ministries Brought to the grave this Innocent,— That they may, ere too late, repent; Thus from her fall, and sacrifice, May all her foes to Heaven arise. III. So in the abodes of endless rest Her virtues will be doubly blest; Blessed in their native innocence, And blessed in blessings they dispense. Already do we seem to hear A voice from this untimely bier, Which calls to those who knew her when She sojourned in the haunts of men. “If ye regret pangs I've endured, “Be by those pangs to Heaven allured! “Thus will my fate, however hard, “Meet with a more than full reward.” [The coffin is slowly borne out of the chapel, followed by the Duke D'Ormond, Count Colville, Le Charier, the Marchioness de Mielcour, and the procession of Nuns, and the curtain falls as the symphony is played which closes this dirge.] THE END.</field>
