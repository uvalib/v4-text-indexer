      <field name="fulltext">CYMBELINE. A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE Countess of Litchfield. MADAM, I Have the honour of your Ladyship's permission to present to you a Tragedy, which, though it met with numerous and unprecedented difficulties and discouragements in the theatre, will, I hope, be thought not altogether unworthy your protection in the world.âIndeed, if the unpopularity of its late situation could in the least affect that degree of merit, which your Ladyship's candor, or the indulgence of the town, may allow it to have, it would ill become me to recommend it to my readers, under the sanction of so polite and illustrious a name.â But your Ladyship has too much good sense, as well as generosity, to judge of this performance by mere appearances, and accidental or unlucky circumstances; and therefore, tho' it will stand as a kind of memorial of the bad fortune, and worse treatment of its author; it may at the same time be a proper testimony of the high respect with which I am, Madam, Your Ladyship's most obliged and most obedient Servant, WILLIAM HAWKINS. Feb. 22, 1759.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The Tragedy of Cymbeline is, in the whole oeconomy of it, one of the most irregular productions of Shakespeare. Its defects however, or rather its superfluities, are more than equalled by beauties, and excellencies of various kinds. There is at the same time something so pleasingly romantic, and likewise truly British in the subject of it, that, I flatter myself, and attempt to reduce it, as near as possible, to the regular standard of the drama, will be favourably received by all, who are admirers of novelty, when propriety is its foundation. I have accordingly endeavoured to new-construct this Tragedy, almost upon the plan of Aristotle himself, in respect of the unity of Time; with so thorough a veneration however for the great Father of the English stage, that, even while I have presumed to regulate and modernize his design, I have thought it an honour to tread in his steps, and to imitate his Stile, with the humility and reverence of a Son. With this view, I have retained in many places the very language of the original author, and in all others endeavoured to supply it with a diction similar thereunto; so that, as an unknown friend of mine has observed, the present attempt is intirely new, whether it be considered as an alteration from, or an imitation of Shakespeare. âThe difficulty of such an attempt, as rational as it may be, has a kind of claim, I presume, to the indulgence of the public; especially as it has been attended likewise with disadvantages. âFor I found myself necessitated by my plan to drop some characters, to contract others, and to omit some scenes and incidents of an interesting nature;âor rather to bring the substance and purport of them within the compass of a few short narrations.âA loss irreparable this, but that conveniencies are likewise to be thrown into the opposite scale; for as, I hope, I have not injured any characters by contracting them, but have left them to all intents, and in point of importance the same; so I have had an opportunity of enlarging and improving some of the original parts, (those particularly of Palador, and Philario, the Pisanio of Shakespeare) and, by varying certain incidents and circumstances, of giving a new cast to the whole drama.âAfter all, I am very far from meaning to detract from the merit of Shakespeare; or from insinuating that the plays of so exalted a genius require such new-modelling as the present, in order to the rendering them useful or entertaining.âI have ventured publicly to defend this great dramatic Poet in the liberties he has taken; but still Shakespeare himself needs not be ashamed to wear a modern dress, provided it can be made tolerably to fit him. The only question then will be, whether the present alteration be a judicious one?âAnd this with all due deference is left to the candour and justice of the public. It will be proper to acquaint the reader, that, this play, was recommended some time since by a person of the first distinction, to the manager of the other theatre; who declared, that he had the very same altered play in his possession, and that it was designed for representation on his stage. Our Cymbeline therefore was obliged to take up his head quarters at Covent-Garden; where he has contended not only with the usual difficulties, but also with others of an extraordinary natureâMrs. Bellamy's declining the part of Imogen has done the play incredible prejudice; and convinces me of the vanity of striving against the stream of popularity in general, or the weight of particular disadvantages. âHowever, I am under obligations to many of the performers, for their best endeavours to do justice to my piece, and for their zeal for its success. To some I am indebted for real service, whose names, as comparisons are invidious, I leave it to the judgment of the reader to supply. Upon the whole, I am at a loss to ballance the account between myself and my fortune, in this whimsical situation. The kind assistance, and, I hope, not extremely partial approbation of some, adds as much to my credit and satisfaction, as the delicacy, or ill-nature, &amp;c. of others, has deducted from my advantages.âTo my friends, I return my sincere acknowledgments, and best wishes; to my enemies, I shall say nothing, 'till they are candid, and sagacious enough to speak more plainly than they have hitherto done,âand more to the purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. Ross. Britons, the daring Author of to-night, Attempts in Shakespear's manly stile to write; He strives to copy from that mighty mind The glowing veinâthe spirit unconfin'dâ The figur'd diction that disdain'd controulâ And the full vigour of the poet's soul! âHappy the varied phrase, if none shall call, This imitation, that original.â For other points, our new advent'rer tries The bard's luxuriant plan to modernize; And, by the rules of antient art, refine The same eventful, pleasing, bold design. Our scenes awake not now the am'rous flame, Nor teach soft swains to woo the tender dame; Content, for bright example's sake, to shew A wife distress'd, and innocence in woe.â For what remains, the poet bids you see, From an old tale, what Britons ought to be; And in these restless days of war's alarms, Not melts the soul to love, but fires the blood to arms. Your great forefathers scorn'd the foreign chain, Rome might invade, and CÃ¦sars rage in vainâ Those glorious patterns with bold hearts pursue, To king, to country, and to honour true!â Oh! then candour and good will attend, Applaud the author in the cordial friend: Remember, when his failings most appear, It ill becomes the brave to be severe.â Look ages back, and think you hear to-night An antient poet, still your chief delight! Due to a great attempt compassion take, And spare the modern bard for Shakespear's sake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE Spoken by Mrs. Vincent. Well, Sirsâthe bus'ness of the day is o'er, And I'm a princess, and a wife no moreâ This bard of our's, with Shakespear in his head, May be well-taught, but surely is ill-bred. Spouse gone, coast clear, wife handsome, and what not, We might have had a much genteeler plot. What madness equals true poetic rage? Fine stuff! a lady in a hermitage! A pretty mansion for the blooming fairâ No tea, no scandal,âno intriguing there.â âThe gay beau-monde such hideous scenes must damnâ What! nothing modish, but one cordial dram! âYet after all, the poet bids me say, For your own credit's sake approve the play; You can't for shame condemn old British wit, (I hope there are no Frenchmen in the pit) Or slight a timely tale, that well discovers, The bravest soldiers are the truest lovers. Such Leonatus was, in our romance, A gallant courtier, tho' he cou'd not dance; Say, wou'd you gain, like him, the fair one's charms, First try your might in hardy deeds of arms; Your muffs, your coffee, and down-beds fore-go, Follow the mighty Prussia thro' the snow; At length bring home the honourable scar, And love's sweet balm shall heal the wounds of war. For me, what various thoughts my mind perplex? Is't better I resume my feeble sex, Or wear this manly garb? it fits me wellâ Gallants instruct meâladies, can you tell? The court's divided, and the gentle beaux, Cryâno disguisesâgive the girl her cloaths, The ladies say, to-night's example teaches, (And I will take their words without more speeches) That things go best whenâwomen wear the breeches.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CYMBELINE. A TRAGEDY. ACT I. SCENE A Royal Palace. Enter two Lords. 1st LORD. I pray you feast mine ears with more of this; For 'tis so long since first I turn'd my back Upon our isle, that I am new in Britain. 2d LORD. I think your wish to breathe in foreign air, Took you away about the very time The royal babes were stolen. 1st LORD. It is true, sirâ Some twenty years agoâ'twas a strange theft, But the concealment stranger; for you tell me, That to this hour there is no guess in knowlege Which way they went. 2d LORD. No, sirâalbeit search Was hot in the enquiryâbut much time Has worn out all that miracleâfresh matter Supplying wonder since. 1st LORD. Of which my ignorance Is not yet perfect learner. 2d LORD. Well then, heed me. Our late good queen (you knew her, sir) whose age Was thought t'advance beyond more hope of children, Yet brought the joyful Cymbeline a daughter, And to his kingdoms a most hopeful heir, In lieu of those he lost: for Imogen (Such is her name) took all the graces in, Which the best wisdom of the times put to her, As we do air, fast as 'tis minister'd. If beauty, innocence, and gentleness Are woman's rarest jewels, she is rich In most full measure of possession. 1st LORD. You speak her fair. 2d LORD. But not to flatter, sir, Tho' I should talk the sun down. You have heard The bright side of the story, for the other It has a sable hueâI'll be brief with itâ 1st LORD. Do, but be plain. 2d LORD. The queen quits mortal being; And Cymbeline, tho' now in wane of life, Takes to his lonely bed a second dame, A widow, bold, ambitious, cunning, cruel, That rul'd his heart by acting what she was not: She mov'd the cred'lous king to wed his daughter With Cloten, her own son, a wretch in whom All qualities that dub a worthy man Are low as worst report.âThe princess cast Disdain upon his suitâand in mean time My plotting stepdame dies. 1st LORD. A lucky death! 2d LORD. 'Twas thought so.âBut the king, in whom this weakness Is his first point of fault, pursues the aim Of his now dead belov'd, and wills the maid To take the crown with this encumbrance Cloten, Or hold her birth-right void. 1st LORD. Alas! poor lady. 2d LORD. Nay there's more woe behind.âSweet Imogen Had long been list'ning to the earnest suit Of Leonatus, a young lord o'th' court, A valiant, frank, and honest gentleman, That has no vice, if poverty be none; And to say all, as much unlike to Cloten As man can be to man.âHim in pure love, And to undo all aims, she weds, and makes The deed soon known her boast: th'enraged king Sends Leonatus into banishment, And her within the circle of this castle Enforceth to abide, till she consent To break her bond to her new-wedded lord By strong propos'd divorce.âThis is the sum Of what you wish'd to hear. 1st LORD. What say the Britons To these proceedings? 2d LORD. As their humours vary; Some blame the king, all pity Imogen, And much lament the loss of Leonatus, Now the black Romans swarm upon our coasts, And virtue's call'd to proof. 1st LORD. They're landed then! 2d LORD. Report says loudly so.âBut hist!âthe kingâ We must forbear, we shall hear more of this. Enter Cymbeline, Cloten, and Lords. CYMBELINE, Well, sirs, the news abroad? 1st LORD. So please your majesty, The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, Are landed on your coast, with large supply Of Roman gentry, by the senate sent. CYMBELINE. Where hold they rendezvous? 2d LORD. My liege, at Milford. CYMBELINE. Now by the soul of great Cassibelan, They're fairly welcome!âOur right valiant Britons Will greet them soldier-like.âCÃ¦sar's ambition, Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch The sides o'th' globe, against all colour here Did put the yoke upon'sâwhich to shake off Becomes a warlike people, such as we Will prove ourselves to be. CLOTEN. My royal father, The dreaded foe we have to cope withal (That in his empire's paw would gripe the world) Oft have we measur'd swords withâere't be long We'll make the mighty name of Cymbeline To sound as roughly in a Roman ear, As did Cassibelan's.â 3d LORD. My gracious liege, Old Caius Lucius, and th'Italian spark Pisanio, that was tendant at his side In his late mission from the Roman camp, Are come, with errand of especial weight Upon their brow. CYMBELINE. Let them approach our presence. Enter C. Lucius, Pisanio, &amp;c. Lucius, we love thy person, tho' thou com'st On deputation from our angry foe. Pisanio, welcome too. Now, sirs, the message. LUCIUS. First for myself, I thank you, royal sir, For courtesies receiv'dânot since forgotâ My present bus'ness is, in CÃ¦sar's name, (CÃ¦sar, that hath more kings his servants than Thyself domestic officers) to know If in repentant yielding thou wilt pay The yearly tribute of three thousand crowns, Granted by fam'd Cassibelan thine uncle, For him and his succession, to great Julius, (Which by thee lately is untendered left) Now fell confusion sets his standard up, And fearful wars point at you? CYMBELINE. Noble Lucius, Words have no terrorsâthere be many CÃ¦sars Ere such another JuliusâYou well know, Till the injurious Roman did extort This tribute, we were free.âOur Britain is A world itself, and we will nothing pay For wearing our own facesâSir, our subjects Will not endure this yokeâand for ourself, To shew less sov'reignty than they, must needs Appear unking-like. LUCIUS. Sir, when late to Britain I came in peaceful embassy to claim This yet contested tribute, I remember The boast that fill'd your mouthâyou vaunted then The nat'ral brav'ry of your isle, which stands As Neptune's park ribbed and paled in With rocks unscaleable, and roaring waters, With sands that would not bear your enemies boats, But suck them up to th' topmast.âWe have leaped This all-forbidding fence,âand, sir, be sure, Where'er the Roman banner waves in wrath, Conquest limps not behind.â [During this speech, Cloten whispers Pisanio.] CYMBELINE. Had Julius found In ev'ry land he mangled with his sword, No stabler footing than he gain'd him here, I could have bought his empire for a tithe Of Britain's leanest soil.âNo more of this. To-morrow we will meet you in the field, And this fair land is yours, if you can win it; If not, our crows shall fare the better for you. Caius, thou'rt welcome: give him tendance, lords, And feast him as befits his quality; The due of honour in no point omit. Once more my hand in friendship; from this time I wear it as your enemy. LUCIUS. Th' event Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well. [Exeunt Lucius, Pisanio, and some Lords. CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it should be thus Hath made us forward. Cloten, our now heir, (For the base Imogen our sometime daughter Has lost all right in us) if so it hap That I must leave my life in battle, thine Is this imperial crown.âGreat Jupiter Sprinkle his blessings on't as thou obey'st Our sov'reign charge.âHear us most heedily. CLOTEN. I do; and will the royal mandate keep 'Mongst my religious bonds. CYMBELINE. Let not our daughter Breathe more the chearful air of liberty; This castle be her home, house, region, world, Till she shall sue thee for the love she scorn'd: And Leonatus, exil'd, worthless beggar, That vilely did seduce her young affections, If with his foot he mark our land again, Pursue to bitt'rest death.âSo did we promise Thy mother, our late queen, whose memory yet Sits fresh upon my heart. Wilt thou do this? CLOTEN. My liege, most willingly. CYMBELINE. Then I've laid out So much of caution well.âLords, we must bustleâ It is the common cause that wakes our armsâ We grapple for our own;âthe puny wren Will chase him in his thief-assailed nest: We fight for Britain's franchises, the laws Of old Mulmutius, our great ancestor, The first of Britain, which did put his brows Within a golden crown. CLOTEN. Those laws, great sir, We will not change for CÃ¦sar's proud behests That rules by bidding. CYMBELINE. Deal we then our swords With dextrous resolution; or hereafter Let them hang up, like utensils discharg'd, In rusty sloth, and vile disuse for ever. The gore-besmeared Mars infuse his fury Into our soldiers breasts; for our own self We go to battle with a blither heart, Than ere did jovial bridegroom long repuls'd, Into his mistress' bed. Sound there aloft Our instruments of war, that British bloods May boil to martial music. Forward, pass. [Flourish. Exeunt all but Cloten.] Thanks to my mother for this joyless crownâ It fills not half my wish: while Leonatus Reigns in the bosom of fair Imogen, 'Tis I am banish'd, and a sov'reign he: Wou'd I cou'd pluck their loves up by the roots! And I am strong in hopeâif young Pisanio (Whom I made mine by making myself CÃ¦sar's When he was last in Britain) hath been true To the employ I gave him, long ere now The jealous exile pines him in belief His lady's truth is tainted.âCome, Pisanioâ He said, he'd quit the train, and here return T'unlade his secrets to me.âOh! sir, welcome! Enter Pisanio. What shall I ask thee first?âHow fares Augustus? Is Leonatus mad? Thou might'st have told A history ere this. PISANIO. I pray you patienceâ First, sir, my lord commends him to your highness; Next, the diseased Leonatus hath Italian fits of jealousy too strong For hellebore to cure. CLOTEN. That's wellâhis grief Is medicine to mine; but when, and how? Give me particulars at largeâmy ear Shall catch thy narrative as greedily, As doth the sick man the kind drops that fall Upon his fever's flame. PISANIO. My lord, as soon As I had foot in Italy, I challeng'd Th' abused Leonatus with some friends To the appointment of a merry meeting; Where, as the wine danc'd brainward, I began To praise the freedom of the British ladies, Their lib'ral hearts, and am'rous 'complishments; When Leonatus vow'd I did them wrong, And was too bold in my persuasion. CLOTEN. So. PISANIO. I fast held me to my sentiment, And, for his doubt provok'd me, swore myself Had tasted half the court, and his own princess, (Whose virtue he had deem'd unparagon'd) At her own suit in bed. CLOTEN. Most brave, brave Roman! PISANIO. On this the Briton vaults me from his seat, And bids my ready sword avow th' affront Done his pure lady's honourâI with looks Of calm assurance, and arms folded thus, Wish'd him attend my proofs. This fair proposal Had sanction from all sides, and liquor'd noddles Jostled to hear my tale. CLOTEN. Why soâProceed. PISANIO. First, roundly I describ'd her bed-chamber, The arras, cieling, pictures; (for of these I took most faithful inventory, when I lay concealed there); then I produc'd The bracelet that I ravish'd from her arm, As sleep, the ape of death, lay dull upon her; And last I quoted the cinque-spotted mole That richly stains her breast, like crimson drops I'th'bottom of a cowslip. CLOTEN. There was voucher Stronger than ever law made.âWell, sir, what To this the Briton? PISANIO. He was quite besides The government of patienceâHe roll'd round His bloodshot eyes, stamp'd with his foot, and writh'd His form into all postures; strove to speak, And chatter'd monkey-like;âat length, his choler Burst into utt'rance rashâ'tis well, he cried, The fiends of hell divide themselves between youâ And so without more ceremony, left Our board, to cast conjectures, as they might, Whereto his fury tended. CLOTEN. Thanks, Pisanio; Saw you him since? PISANIO. No; but the rumour was, Ere I left Rome, that he had turn'd his thought To bloody purpose of revenge. CLOTEN. 'Tis goodâ Pisanio, I did love this ladyâlie I should not, if I said I love her stillâ O she is sweeter than the breath of spring Wooing the maiden violetâ'tis pastâ And I have lost her. PISANIO. She hath wrong'd you. CLOTEN. Trueâ She hath disdain'd meâspurn'd meâonce she vow'd, The meanest garment that e'er clip'd the body Of Leonatus, was in her respect Dearer than all the hairs upon my head, Were they all made such men.âThe south-fog rot Him, her, and CÃ¦sar's foes. PISANIO. Thou wishest well.â This Leonatus is a thorn, my lord, That pricks your side of greatness. If he 'scape The snare that traps him now, and haply live To recognize his country and his queen, Your crown will totterâfor the lady keeps High seat in ev'ry heart; and for her husband, (I speak in envy this) thro' Italy Tongues quarrel in his praise; the current voice is, So fair an outward, and such inward stuff, Endows no man but him. CLOTEN. I prythee stopâ Was he not yok'd with Imogen, myself Could make my tongue a bankrupt in his praise; But being what he is, I must abhor him: I have no other hate than what I bear Him, and his fortunes; for his kinder stars Have still eclipsed mine: but I will shroud me Beneath the Roman wingâBritain, thou hast Loud service of my tongue; my heart is CÃ¦sar's, Of whom I'll hold my crown; these restif Britons We must have curb upon; left gall'd subjection Feeling the heavy lash of government, Fly off from his obedience. PISANIO. CÃ¦sar bad me Insure his count'nance, and puissant arm, Who will attack your rightâ CLOTEN. We're bound to him. Sir, I will post me in th'approaching battle, Where least our British archers may annoy The Roman legions. PISANIO. It is wellâbut histâ Who is't comes yonder? CLOTEN. 'Tis Philario, friend And council-man to Leonatus; best Abruptly part we here, as chance alone Had brought us thus together. [Exeunt severally. Enter Philario. The four-brow'd Cloten!âIt is wide suspicion Thou wear'st cold British heart, and this rencounter With young Pisanio colours it more strong. But I have other care.âHe writes me here, (Pulling out letters.) In spleenful terms of most confirm'd belief, That he hath cognizance of her incontinence; And wills me, by the love and truth I owe him, To murther her.âPerhaps some false Italian Hath the infection of foul slander pour'd In his too ready ear.âPerhaps she's fall'n.â She's fair,âthat's much;âshe's young,âthat's more,âI hold The virtue of the best attemptable.â I must proceed with wary steps herein.â Here's that will 'tice her from her prison-house, Or for true love, or seeming.âI will steal This way to her apartment. [Exit. SCENE opens, and discovers Imogen in her apartment, sitting by a table; a book on the table. A father cruel, and a suitor base, A banish'd husband tooâO that's the grief That gives the deepest wound.âThen am I sure The shes of Italy will not betray Mine int'rest, and his honour?âWicked fear! Where he abides, falshood is out of fashion, And truth the law to action.âHark! the clock! (Clock strikes.) 'Tis the tenth hour of mornâthe very time I bad him think on me, and combat heav'n With prayers, as I would do.âO bless him Gods, And sweeten all his cares with drops of comfort. âNow to my bookâPhilosophy, best doctor, Thou wisely dost prescribe to human woe The lenitive of patience.â (Reads.) Enter Philario. There she sitsâ Sweet student! with a look as chaste as Dian's.â If she's disloyal, falshood never yet Hung out so fair a signâyet seems, we know, Is often read for isâI must disturb herâ Imogenâladyâ IMOGEN. Hah! what now, Philario? PHILARIO. Dear lady, here are letters from your lordâ IMOGEN. From whom? from Leonatus?âLet me seeâ Oh! learn'd indeed were that astronomer, That knew the stars as I his charactersâ He'd lay the future openâYou good Gods, Let what is here contain'd relish of love; Of my lord's health; of his content; yet not That we two are apartâof his content In all but thatâgood wax, thy leaveâblest bees That make these locks of counselâGood news, Gods. PHILARIO. Now let me con her visage as she readsâ IMOGEN. (Reading) Justice and your father's wrath, should he take me in his dominions, could not be so cruel to me, but you, oh! the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am at Milford Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and yours increasing in love, Leonatus. Oh! for a horse with wingsâhear'st thou, Philario, He is at Milford Havenâprithee tell me How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs May plod it in a day, why may not I Glide thither in an hour? Then, good Philario, Who long'st like me to see thy friend; who long'st (O let me bate) but not like me, yet long'st, But in a fainter kindâOh! not like meâ For mine's beyond, beyondâtell me how far To this same blessed Milford; and by the way Tell me how Wales was made so happy as T'inherit such a haven. But first of all, How may we steal from hence? I prithee speak How far to Milford? PHILARIO. Madam, we may reach it, With horses swift and sure of foot, before The sun has ended his day's journey. IMOGEN. Wellâ But how to get from henceâ PHILARIO. I have a thoughtâ Lady, a thousand eyes keep centinel To watch your motions hereâyet haply these Unquestion'd we may passâsuppose you did Assume another mien, and but disguise That, which t'appear itself must not now be But by self-dangerâcannot you awhile Forget to be a woman? IMOGEN. I'm almost A man already. PHILARIO. Make yourself but like one, And ev'ry gate shall kindly open to us, Tho' Argus' self were porter. IMOGEN. In my closet I have a suit of boy's apparel ready, That was my page'sâunder which disguise, And with what imitation I can borrow From youth of such a season, I will quit This castle's loathsome hold. PHILARIO. You are resolv'd then To tie yourself to Leonatus' fortune, And leave your father and the court behind you? IMOGEN. No court, no father nowâ(for what's a father Whose mind my crafty stepdame poison'd, that Bore all down with her brain) no, nor no more Of that harsh, sullen, haughty, princeling Cloten, That Cloten, whose love-suit has been to me As fearful as a siege. PHILARIO. Hie to your chamber, And fit you to your manhoodâdull delay Is sin 'gainst resolution. IMOGEN. I am arm'd Ev'n for events of peril infinite, And woman's love is courage. PHILARIO. I will hence, And able horse and furniture prepare For this adventure: I'll be with you, lady, Before you're well equipp'd. IMOGEN. Do, good Philario: The gracious Gods direct us! [Exeunt severally.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE The Castle. Enter Cloten and Lords. 1st LORD. In truth, my lord, her throwing favours on So low a thing as Leonatus is, Slanders her judgment much; it doth subtract From her else princely qualitiesâ CLOTEN. I think soâ 2d LORD. Is there a spell in Leonatus' name? What is he in his person, nature, fortune, That you are not, and more?âSay, is he young? You reap'd your chin since he didâis he valiant? By Mars, you fear him notâhandsome? you read Your faithful glass with more content than heâ For birth and fortune the proportion is As top to th' bottom. CLOTEN. Oh! your pardon, sir, His lady's smile has tutor'd him a pride That ranks him with the highestâand though Rome His body holds, he hath a heart and hope In Britain still; which nothing can cut off, But something that may give a mortal wound Or to his life, or love. Enter Cymbeline, and other Lords. 1st LORD. My lord, the king. CYMBELINE. Await you here our daughter, noble Cloten? Will she not forth? CLOTEN. She will vouchsafe no notice. CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new, She hath not yet forgot him: some more time May wear the print of his remembrance out, And then she's yours. CLOTEN. Never, I fear, my lord. O I have proved her heart impregnable; I should, my liege, your patience overstretch To tell in course the labours of my love; Denials but increas'd my services; I have put by my nature, crouch'd and fawn'd; I seem'd as if inspir'd to do the duties I tender'd to her; if she had forsworn All commerce with mankind, I'd been content; But Leonatus' suit had witchcraft in't, While mine she heard as does the ruthless rock The drowning seaman's moan. CYMBELINE. It must be humour: The stubborn tendency of woman's will, Still pliant or resisting 'gainst all rules Of virtue and discretionâLet her sufferâ I have a child in theeâ CLOTEN. A thankful one. CYMBELINE. Call her before us, sirs, (exeunt Lords) for we would make A last demand to her unduteous spirit, Ere yet we take the fieldâand here we swear By the great sov'reign of th'immortal Gods, If she consent not fully to the act, Whereby we late have sentenc'd her divorce From that base slave, whose vileness must not soil The lustre of our crown, we reconfirm Our royal grant to thee, adopted son Of our dear love; and her blot out for ever From all connection with our blood, and title To this imperial diademâHow now? Re-enter Lords. 1st LORD. So please you, sir, her chambers all are lock'd, Nor answer will be given to the noise Our loudest clamours make. CYMBELINE. Hah! fled! escap'd! How may this be?âCloten, the guard is yoursâ Have you not surety of their faith? CLOTEN. My liege, They are the pick'd of my affection, and I stand amaz'd at this. CYMBELINE. Where is Philario? 2d LORD. My liege, some two hours since, I saw him take The road that windeth round the castle grove, And by his side a comely youth that seem'd A page o'th' court. CYMBELINE. My life it must be she; Wing'd with the fervor of her love she's flown To Leonatus, and Philario is The pander of her folly. We're abus'd; All Italy in arms would hurt us less Than what aggrieves us hereâOur dear son Cloten, Head thou the search for these vile runagates, With thy best faculties of diligence; Then follow to the fieldâWe must be gone; But we will carry our displeasure with us, And Rome shall feel we're angry.âCome away. [Exeunt. Manet Cloten with some Lords. To horse, sirsâmark meâI am dead to love, And vengeance speeds me now. [Exit with Lords. SCENE A Forest, and a Cave at a distance. Enter from the Cave Bellarius, Palador, and Cadwal. BELLARIUS. It is a goodly skyâStoop, boys, this gate Instructs you how t'adore the heavens, and bows you To ev'ning's holy office. Gates of monarchs Are arch'd so high that giants may jut thro', And keep their impious turbands on without Obeisance to the sunâHail! thou fair heav'n, We house i'th' rock, yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do. PALADOR. Hail heav'n! CADWAL. Hail heav'n! BELLARIUS. Our life, my boys, is such as mortals led Ere living was an art. The busy knaves That clatter in yon world, are mad to purchase Honour with danger; wealth with envy; pleasure With manifold infirmity; while we, Poor in possession, in enjoyment rich, Have no more wants than means; our av'rice is not Wider than are our stomachs; our ambition, Who first shall scale the steepy mountain's cliff, Or strike the destin'd venison; this is life, And health, the life of life. CADWAL. My rev'rend father, Out of your proof you speakâwe, poor unfledged, Have never wing'd from view o'th' nest, nor know What air's from home; haply this life is best, If quiet life is best; sweeter to you That have a sharper known. PALADOR. What shall we speak of, When we are old as you? When we shall hear The rain and wind beat dark December, how In this our pinching cave shall we discourse The freezing hours away? We have seen nothingâ We're beastly; subtle as the fox for prey; Like valiant as the wolf for what we eat; Our courage is to chace what flies; our cage We make a choir as doth the prison'd bird, And sing our bondage freely. BELLARIUS. How you speak? Did you but know the cities' usuries, The art o'th' court, the toil of war that goes In quest of honest fame, yet dies i'th'search, And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph As record of fair act; did you know this How would you smile in solitudeâOh! boys, The sharded beetle is in safer hold Than is the full-wing'd eagleâI was once First with the best of noteâCymbeline lov'd me, And when a soldier was the theme, my name Was not far offâThen was I as a tree Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night A storm, or robb'ry, call it what you will, Shook down my mellow hangings, nay my leaves, And left me bare to weather. PALADOR. Uncertain favour! BELLARIUS. My fault was nothing, (as I oft have told you) But that two villains, stand'ring my fair honour, Swore me confed'rate with the Romans: so Follow'd my banishment; and these twenty yearsâ This rock, and these demesnes have been my world; Where I have liv'd at honest freedom; paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The fore-end of my timeâbut up to the woodsâ This is not hunter's languageâHe who brings The largest fardle home is lord o'th'feast. CADWAL. Come, Paladorâ [Exeunt Pal. and Cad. BELLARIUS. I'll meet you in the valleys. Thou divine nature, how thyself thou blazon'st In these two princely boys! O Cymbeline! Thy sons, tho' train'd thus meanly up among These desart rocks, have lofty thoughts that hit The roofs of palacesâ'tis wonderful That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught, Civility not seen from others, valour That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop, As if it had been sow'd.âWellâI must afterâ [Exit SCENE Another part of the Forest. Enter Philario, and Imogen in boy's clothes. IMOGEN. Thou told'st me when we came from home, the place Was near at hand. Ne'er long'd his mother so To see him first, as I do now. Where are we? Here is no path, no proof of habitation; And, but we tread on solid earth, methinks We're out o'th' bounds o'th' worldâI pray, Philario, Where dost thou lead me? It will soon be night, For see the lamp of PhÅbus is nigh quench'd In Thetis' watry bosom.â PHILARIO. Madam, here Our journey ends: IMOGEN. Here! where is Leonatus? PHILARIO. Lady, at Romeâ'twere treason to be here. IMOGEN. Alas! what means this coldness of reply? Hast thou abus'd me with a forged letter? Where is my lord, Philario?âWhat's the matter? Why offer'st thou that paper to me with A look untender? how! my husband's hand! Quick, slay, or cure me outright. PHILARIO. Please you, read, And you shall find the duty I am bound to. IMOGEN reads. My wife, Philario, hath play'd the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof, as strong as my grief, and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part, thou, Philario, must act for me; Let thine own hand take away her life; I shall give thee oppurtunity in the road to Milford: my letter is for that purpose to her: so, if thou fear to strike, and to certify it is done, thou hast broken thy vows, and art a traitor to friendship. (Imogen drops the letter, stands silent, and in the utmost consternation.) PHILARIO. Is her amazement innocent or guilty? Tell me some God,âfor sure a mortal wit May else misconstrue such perplexity.â (Aside.) Madam, what cheer? are you prepar'd to die? IMOGEN. I false! I false to's bed? have I been chaste As snows that sun-beam never kist, for this? Gods! have I left my father's gilded roof, The rights of birth, the largesses of fortune, The pageants of pre-eminence, and all That womanhood is said to doat on, yea And womanhood itself?âhave I left these, No jewel taken with me but my honour, To hear I'm false? oh! oh! PHILARIO. She heeds me not.â] IMOGEN. False to his bed? what is it to be false? To lie in watch there, and to think on him? To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep charge nature, To break it with a fearful dream of him, And cry myself awake?âthat false to's bed! PHILARIO. What shall I do? I must be home to th' point. (Aside.) Lady, I stand not here to try your cause: I am your executioner :âyour judge, My friend, to whom I've sworn all offices, Appoints me to this deed;âif thou art guilty, I hold the sword of justice; if guilt-free, Thy blood must light on Leonatus' headâ One pray'r and I dispatch.â IMOGEN. That paper, Sir, Hath done the bus'ness: You may sheath your sword;â I've heard I am a strumpet, and my heart Therein false struck, can take no greater wound, Nor tent to bottom that. PHILARIO. O yet bethink youâ With what a weight descends the guilty soul, Sunk with a load of unrepented crimes? For such th' infernal ministers prepare The darkest cells of Erebus. IMOGEN.. Nay, preach not, But do thy workâand when thou seest my lord, A little witness my obedience;âlookâ Smiling I meet thy angry swordâcome, hit Th'innocent mansion of my love, my heartâ Prythee, dispatchâIs that the stern Philario, That came on murder's errand?âStrikeâfor now The lamb intreats the butcher. PHILARIO. O that look Would out-face proof. (Aside.) Hence thou vile instrument, Thou shalt not damn my hand.â (Throws down the sword.) It cannot be But that my friend's abus'dâsome crafty villain That's sing'lar in his art, hath done you both This cursed injury.âO thou vip'rous slander, Thy edge is sharper than the murd'rous sword; Thy tongue out-venoms all the worms of Nile; Thy breath, that rides upon the posting winds, Belies all corners of the world.âI'll speak As from most firm conviction of her virtue, To probe her still more deeplyâI have yet More test to put her to. (Aside.) IMOGEN. Alas! Philario, Some jay of Italy, with painted feathers, Hath robb'd me of his heart; poor I am stale; A cast-off robe; a garment out of fashion; And, for I'm richer than to hang by th' wall, I must be riptâto pieces with meâoh! Men's vows are women's traitors. PHILARIO. If it be so, (As I confess it doth provoke belief) The face of virtue shall from hence be thought The mask of villainy; and Leonatus Hath laid the level to all proper men; Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd, From his great fall. IMOGEN. Take up thy sword, Philario, Behold my breast obedient as the scabbard.â I liv'd but to one end, to do his pleasure, And to that end would die.â PHILARIO. O gracious lady, Since I receiv'd command to do this bus'ness, I scarce have slept one wink. IMOGEN. Do't, and to bed then. PHILARIO. I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first. No, thou sweetest, If he hath stain'd his loyalty, his mind Is now as low to thine, as were his fortunes.â What! shall his vileness batteries erect To shake thy fort of innocence?âLive, lady, To kill him with thine eyeâhe shall be told That I have done his bidding, and awhile You in some residence obscure shall 'bide, As is thy present habit.âCome, let's hence. Sure this discourse hath much bewilder'd me, Or we have march'd too wide.âFortune befriend us, Else we have far to supper.âThis way, lady.â [Exeunt. SCENE the Cave. Enter Bellarius. My meditation hath misguided me, And I have miss'd the boys. They'll not return, Tho' all the elements should be at war, 'Till darkness sends 'em home. O Cymbeline, When thou shalt see thy royal progeny, (As I do mean with the first 'vantage to Render thee back these youths) thou shalt confess Thy loss was gain, and thank calamity. Hah! who are these? Enter Philario and Imogen. What chance cou'd wind their steps Thus far from all society? 'tis strange! IMOGEN. (seeing him) O look, Philario, lookâwhat rev'rend figure Is this approaches? In his visage sits The treasur'd wisdom of an hundred yearsâ The sages of old time are pictur'd thus; Accost him, good Philario; for his presence Awes my unskilful heart. PHILARIO. Grave hermit, hail! Pardon, old man, our ignorant intrusion, Upon your venerable solitude. I, and my nephew here, are bound for Milford, And chance wide straying from our way to night, Have light upon your lonely habitation. BELLARIUS. Thou hast a gracious favourâfor this youngling, The dimpled God that holds the cup to Jove Is second to him.âYou are welcome, sirsâ If you can shape your fancy to your needs, The wholesome viands of a homely board, That bloated luxury ne'er cater'd to, Shall be most freely yours. Your names, beseech you? PHILARIO. Philario, sirâthis gentle youths' Fidele.â BELLARIUS. Why once more welcomeâthis low roof's your home, While 'tis worth owning.âI've two sons, whose age Will yoke in followship with yours, Fideleâ Philario mates with meâtarry awhile, And purge your lungs of the foul air o'th' city, Or of the court, for that is sickly tooâ O! I have liv'd to make the pop'lous world A stock for laughter. IMOGEN. Uncle, we have found Delightful lodging, and a gracious hostâ This good old father's greeting sooths my spirit, Faint with this long day's march. PHILARIO. Look here, Fideleâ I have a cordial of especial proof, I pray thee drink it offâit is a drug That three times hath my father's life redeem'd From the arrest of death. It has more virtue Than I shall tell you now. (Aside.) IMOGEN. drinks. Uncle, I thank you. BELLARIUS. Here come my boys.âSirs, stand aside awhile; How will they take this novelty? they ne'er Saw mortal but their mother, and myself. Enter Palador and Cadwal. You, Cadwal, are best woodman, and are nam'd, The master of the feastâhah! what are these? Go not near, Cadwalâthey are Gods that come In visitation to our hermitageâ The eldest is God Pan; the other seems Like swift-leg'd Mercury, or the God of Love, Drest in his mother's smiles.âDown, Cadwal, down On knees of adoration, and beseech Propitious aspect from their deitiesâ Hear us immortal pow'rs.â (Kneels.) BELLARIUS. Rise up my boys: These are but mortals like ourselves, made up Of the same stuff as weâwhen we have supp'd, We will enlarge our conference. PALADOR. Are they men? By the puissant Jove they're noble onesâ I long to commune with 'emâfor that youth My heart is high in sudden palpitationâ Methinks I love him neither more nor less, Cadwal, than I do thee. CADWAL. Ev'n so says Cadwal. IMOGEN. Uncle, I have a tender feeling too, That yearns on these fair strangersâI had once Two brothers, whom the hand of early fate Snatch'd from the worldâIf they had liv'd, I think They had been like this gentle pair.âSweet youths, May I not call you brothers? PALADOR. Ay, most freely. And, sir, if you are uncle to our brother, You stand in kin to usâI pray, good father, Let him be tutor to us: we would learn The mystery of life; the art of war; The policy of kings; the rules of states; Will you instruct us? we are ign'rant yet What drawing breath is good for. PHILARIO. These young plants Are of the kindest growth my eyes e're sawâ Why, who would dream this barren desart here A nursery of demi-gods? BELLARIUS. Enough; Vice is the child of praise; my boys are such As nature made them, and she made 'em not For art to marr; but let us in to supperâ Our appetites shall make what's homely, sav'ry: We eat for health, and rise before the sun, Silvers the mountain shrubs.âCome, boys conduct Your new compeer.âPhilario, you are mine.â PALADOR. The night to th'owl, and morn to th' lark less welcome. [Exeunt into the cave. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. Enter Philario from the Cave. How restless is this thinking! welcome day! How I shall sift her thoroughlyâfor what's past Little hangs on itâwere she true and artless, Thus would she' have; if false and artful, thusâ She shall be told in words as strong and hateful, As earnestness can make 'em, what she drank Is deadly to all sense, as for a time It is, to full effect.â'Tis a rare drug That locks the spirits up in shew of death, To be more fresh revivingâDread of death Shall force me out the truth; fraud will be honest Itself thus over-reach'dâbut hist, Bellarius. Enter Bellarius. Our courtiers say all's savage but at courtâ How does this hospitable rock, Bellarius, Give 'em the lie? BELLARIUS. Our minds must not be measur'd By this rude place we live inâYou are rouz'd Before the hunter's hourâCould you not sleep Upon your bed of moss? PHILARIO. Ay, sir, as soundly As cradled infancy. BELLARIUS. Your chamber was The best o'th' houseâFor us we often make The star-wrought sky our testerâWeariness Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth Finds the down pillow hardâwhat think you, sir, Of this our way of life? PHILARIO. It is unknown, And therefore envied notâour courtly great ones May blush at their high breeding; here's the place Where virtue teaches schoolâare your sons up? By Jove multipotent there's not a couple, Whose praise fame trumpets with her loud'st O yes, That can out-peer these twainâthey seem as gentle As Zephyrs blowing 'neath the hyacinth, Not wagging his sweet head, and yet as rough (Their sprightly blood by a good tale once warm'd) As the rude wind that by the top doth take The mountain pine, and make him stoop to th' vale.â BELLARIUS. Why, thou hast mark'd them wellâLo! where they come, And with 'em your Fidele. Enter Palador, Cadwal, and Imogen. BELLARIUS. So, my boys, Are your devotions to the morning star With solemn homage paid? PALADOR. They are, my father. BELLARIUS. What says Fidele? Can he like a court No bigger than this cave? IMOGEN. Believe me, sir, The partnership of labour here, is richer Than golden honours there. CADWAL. I've said I love theeâ I cannot say how much, but sure as much As I do love my fatherâ BELLARIUS. What? How? How? PALADOR. If it be sin to say so, sir, I join me In my good brother's faultâI know not why I love this youth, and I have heard you say Love reasons without reason. Fate at door, And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say My father, not this youthâ BELLARIUS. 'Tis wonderful: Does instinct tell them I am not their father? (Aside.) Wellâto the fieldâtis the fourth hour o'th' morn. Philario, and Fidele will remain Here in the caveâWe'll come to you after hunting; Or are you for our sport? IMOGEN. I am not wellâ A sudden laziness creeps o'er my senses, As if fatigue acknowledg'd no repair By this nights' sleepâ PHILARIO. The drug begins to workâ (Aside.) PALADOR. Go you to huntingâI'll abide with him. IMOGEN. Noâto your journal courseâthe breach of custom Is breach of allâMy uncle will stay hereâ FarewelâI wish you sportâI shall be well By your returnâ ALL. We'll not be long away.â [Exeunt Bellarius, Palador, and Cadwal. PHILARIO. These are kind creatures, lady. IMOGEN. On my life I'd change my sex to be companion with 'em, Since my dear lord is false. PHILARIO. I would confer Once more upon that theme. IMOGEN. I'm sick already; And would you minister fresh pain, Philario? PHILARIO. ComeâI'll no more dissembleâyou are known False to your banish'd lord. IMOGEN. What hear I, Gods! PHILARIO. The truth, the killing truthâart not asham'd? âBut shame is masculineâCould I find out The woman's part in meâfor there's no motion That tends to vice in man, but I affirm It is the woman's part; be't lying, note it, The woman's flatt'ring, yours; deceiving, yours; Lust and rank thoughts, yours, yours; revenges, yours; Ambition; covetings; change of prides; disdain; Nice longings; slanders; mutability; All faults that may be nam'd, nay, that hell knows, Why yours in part, or all; but rather allâ For ev'n to vice You are not constant, but are changing still One vice but of a minute old, for one Not half so old as that. IMOGEN. Am I awake? Or have you senses perfect? PHILARIO. 'Tis enoughâ I have atchieved more than er'e did Julius, And will be chronicled 'mongst those wise few That have out-craftied woman. IMOGEN. You amaze me. PHILARIO. Oh! no more foolingâI have proof that tells The time, the place, theâfie upon it, lady, It wounds my modesty to quote the deeds That cost thee not a blush. IMOGEN. Blasphemer, hold! Thou art in league with perjur'd Leonatus, And dost traduce a lady that despises Malice and thee like. PHILARIO. Go toâyou're naughtâ IMOGEN. Villain, your proof? Why stand you idle thus? If thou do'st see a speck upon my honour, Prick at it with the sword, your just remorse E'en now let drop. PHILARIO. Mistake not, lady mine, Remorse was counterfeit, my purpose real; I found you past all grace, and did commence Cunning in my revenge; your punishment Were nothing if not such; you have your death, Yet never felt his sting. IMOGEN. What says Philario! PHILARIO. O now you tremble like a guilty soul Beneath the furies lashânow you would pour A deluge of salt grief to wash your crimesâ It is too late, thou hast out-liv'd repentanceâ That draught was tinctured with a mortal juice, And he that drinks an acron on't, is serv'd, As I would serve a dog. IMOGEN. Sir, my surprize Relishes not of fear.âThis is a cure Which you do call a chastisementâI feel The death thou speak'st of curdling in my veins.â How sweetly do they sleep whom sorrow wakes not! Farewelâmy innocence is sacrifice, Or to the blindfold rage of jealousy, Or to estranged loveâO Leonatus, The Gods have pity on thee. PHILARIO. Do I speak? Is this my hand? are these my eyes?âAll this I will to question put, if thou art trueâ O Imogen, but that I thought thee foul, And thy confession a superfluous warrant, I would have ta'en my sucking infant's throat, And broach'd it with my martial scymeter, E're touch'd thy precious life. IMOGEN. I do forgive theeâ Thy judgment (which how warp'd it matters not) Condemn'd me to this deathâNay, weep not, sir, Commend me to my lordâalas! Philario, I grieve myself to think how much hereafter, When the belief, or false affection, which Holds pris'ner now his mind, shall leave him free, His mem'ry will be pang'd by looking back On my hard case of woeâmy brain is heavyâ PHILARIO. The mighty Gods throw stones of sulphur on All jealous, head-sick foolsâHe saw it notâ And ev'ry day's experience doth disprove The strong'st reportâO the accursed fate That damn'd me to this officeâ IMOGEN. Curb thy rage Unprofitably loos'dâI'll in, and dieâ Follow me notâmy soul has that to do Which is best done in secretâfare thee wellâ Present to our good host, and my sweet brothers, My thanks and choicest blessings. [Exit. Imogen into the Cave. PHILARIO. It goes well, Her honour I have fann'd, and found it chafflessâ Friend, thou art fool, or villainâIf I prove Thou would'st betray my love to purposes Of hell-black colour, tho' our friendship stood Upon a brazen base, it should dissolve, And, like the film that dews the morning flower, Break into unseen air. Hah Palador!â Enter Palador hastily Lend me thy sword, good Uncleâas I crost The mountain's ridge, a fellow at a distance (Whose drapery by far out-glistens thine) Bad me with accents stern and masterly Stop and attend his speechâI hied me hither, And, if he follow, will responses make By word, or blow, an he dare question meâ Belike 'tis talk'd at court that such as we Cave here; haunt here; are outlaws; and in time May make some stronger head; the which he hearing Is sworn with choice attendants in his train To fetch us inâIt is a crisis that My father sometimes drops discourses of.â PHILARIO. Say'st so? I will go climb the rock, and spie What companies are near. [Exit. Philario. PALADOR. Doâfor this bravo, Let me alone with himâthis instrument Fits my hand wellâI grasp it fast as tho' 'Twere part of me, and grew unto my armâ I feel I can do any thing but fearâ I will look out.âBy the broad shield of Mars He comes unto my wishâup sword, and sleep Till I awake thee, hap'ly soonâ Enter Cloten. CLOTEN. My zeal Hath far out-gone my trainâhark theeâthou fellow, Why didst thou fly me? didst not hear me call? PALADOR. I did, and therefore came not. CLOTEN. Saucy hindâ Thou art some villain mountaineerâWhat art thou? PALADOR. A manâthou look'st as if thou cam'st from court, And yet thou art no more. CLOTEN. Thou know'st me notâ Answer me, wretch, on peril of thy lifeâ Saw'st thou two trav'lers speeding thro' the forestâ The elder somewhat 'bove my age, the younger Few years below your own? PALADOR. Such if I saw. I saw 'em not for theeâ CLOTEN. Ha! dost thou mock me? Where are the traitors, slave? quick, orâ PALADOR. A thing More slavish did I ne'er, than answering A slave, without a blow. CLOTEN. Thou art a robber; A law-breaker; a villain; yield thee, thiefâ PALADOR. To whom? to thee? what art thou? Have not I An arm as big as thine? a heart as big? Thy words I grant are biggerâfor I wear not My dagger in my mouthâsay what thou art, Why I should yield to thee? CLOTEN. Thou villian base! Know'st me not by my garb? PALADOR. No, nor thy tailorâ Who is thy grandfather?âhe made that garb, Which, as it seems, makes theeâ CLOTEN. Injurious thief! Hear but my name, and trembleâ PALADOR. What's thy name? CLOTEN. Cloten, thou villain! PALADOR. Cloten? then double villain be thy name; I cannot tremble at it; were it Toad, Adder, or Spider, it would move me soonerâ CLOTEN. Then to thy fear, and mere confusion, know I'm son to the late queen, and heir to th' crown. PALADOR. In troth I'm sorry for't; thyself not seeming So worthy as thy birth.âMe thou hast wrong'd, Thou' thou wert son of Juno. CLOTEN. Thou vile thing! Wrong thee!âBut die the deathâthou wilt be honour'd To perish by this handâwhen I have slain thee, I'll on the gate of Lud's Town set thy head To roast i'th' sun. (Drawing.) PALADOR. Are you for scratching? Comeâ To-day I'll lose a soldier's maidenheadâ Hah! are you down? I see a prince is made (fight) Of penetrable stuffâ (Cloten falls.) CLOTEN. Dog! thou hast slain me. (dies.) PALADOR. Ay, and the world no loserâThis is sport Hotter than huntingâI will kill no more The tim'rous deerâsuch killing's cowardiceâ My reeking sword sweats honourably nowâ Thou poor loud-boasting fool! Hah! how I stalk In triumph round thee! like the victor lion Slow pacing 'bout the mangled tyger's corse, And grimly taking solace in his slaughterâ Enter Bellarius, Cadwal, and Philario. BELLARIUS. I heard the clash of swordsâO Palador! What hast thou done? PALADOR. I'm perfect whatâcut thro' one Cloten's heart, Son to the queen, after his own reportâ He came in search of thee and fair Fidele, Or I did much misconstrue his demandâ (To Philario. He call'd me villain, mountaneer, and swore He would displace my head, where now it grows, And set it on Lud's Town. PHILARIO. 'Tis very Cloten, The king's adopted son. PALADOR. Why had the king Misus'd bold Palador, his royalty Had lain so weltring thereâWhat company Discover you abroad? PHILARIO. No single soul Can I set eye onâyet 'tis strange his anger Should bring him here alone. BELLARIUS. I'll not believe But quick revenge pursues us! PALADOR. Let it come; Let it be such as possible strength may meet, It shall be welcome. CADWAL. That's my valiant brotherâ Thou hast said well, done well; O Palador! I love thee brotherly, but envy much Thou'st rob'd me of this deed. Where's sweet Fidele? PHILARIO. Asleep within the cave.âHear me, good sirsâ This act, I trust, is dangerless, except We're traitors to ourselves.âBoys, take the body, And let it down the creek behind the rock Into the sea (Exeunt Pal. and Cad. with the body.) Bellarius, hark a wordâ Thy sons are noble ones, and pity 'tis Their worth should waste in dull obscurity. To day fell war unfurls his bloody flag Between the Roman and the British host, And confidence is goad to either side. Upon the border of the forest here, The Roman lies encamp'dâand two hours march Will join our countrymenâyour valiant boys May, in such fight as this is like to prove, Begin and end a fame. BELLARIUS. Why now or never 'Tis fit they launch into the world, Philario, But fitter never. PHILARIO. Do not say so, sir; Britain doth lack such hearts. BELLARIUS. Well, you shall rule meâ Indeed I wish'd for such a day as this, To make them known to Cymbeline. (aside.) They're here. Enter Palador and Cadwal. PALADOR. We've sent him down the stream, and so to sea, To tell the fishes he's the queen's son Cloten.â BELLARIUS. My boys, your uncle here would steal you from me, To your bruis'd country's wars. PALADOR. Oh! let us go; For this hath been our daily fervent prayerâ Uncle, intreat againâwhy I can fightâ You have to-day a sampleâso can Cadwalâ Our opposition we will stake 'gainst two, The stoutest of old Romeâay, against odds, If valour's scarce in Britain. CADWAL. Odds to chuse. BELLARIUS. The king hath wrong'd meâhe deserveth not Your service, and my love. PALADOR. The king's deservings I weigh not nowâthis is a public cause. I do not know my countrymen, but know They were not born to be the slaves of Rome, To wear the badge of foreign tyranny, And crouch to aliens that dominion hold By rape, not rightâ PHILARIO. O! such a spirit as this Will drive the pestilent invasion hence, And post it short-breath'd home. PALADOR. Why, my good uncle, Why not pursue it at the heels, and pay The foe in kindâLet the hot war return Upon our enemies heads.âO! for the time, When Britons bold shall throng the streets of Rome, And breathe strange climes, that conquest makes our own. PHILARIO. Most like a Briton said.âTo-day shall put This courage to more proof. PALADOR. Sir, I will fight For liberty, and Britain, till the blood Be drain'd thro' all my veins; and when my arm Has lost his office, I will to the last Give token of resistance. CADWAL. So will I; I am asham'd to look upon the sun, To have the benefit of his blest beams So long a poor unknown: Sure than be so Better to cease to be. BELLARIUS. Have with you boys! No reason I, since of your lives you set So slight a valuation, shou'd reserve My crack'd one to more care.âWe'll all to the army. Philario and Fidele shall keep house, Till our return. PHILARIO. Not so Bellarius; we Habited like yourself, to 'scape the eye Of knowledge, will attest to day the feats Of these brave lads. PALADOR. Why, let the Gods be witness, And celebrate this birth-day of our gloryâ Liberty! CADWAL. Britain! BOTH. Liberty and Britain! BELLARIUS. Go, see if young Fidele be awake. [Exeunt Palador and Cadwal. Doth not this mettle promise well, Philario? I scarce wou'd change a son with Jupiter! The service of these lusty boys shall do The king more good, than this same Cloten's death Hath done him harm.â(Solemn music within.) Hah! wherefore sounds within My most ingenious instrument? What cause Should give it motion now? Enter Palador. PALADOR. The bird is dead That we have made so much on. O come in And see what violent hands stern death has laid Upon the sweetest lily of the land.â (They go into the Cave.) SCENE opens and discovers the inside of the Cave, with Bellarius, Philario, Palador, and Cadwal, round the Body of Imogen, lying upon a Couch of Moss. PHILARIO. Alas! my dearest nephew! PALADOR. I had rather Have leap'd from twenty years of age to eighty, And turn'd my warlike spear into a crutch, Than have seen this. BELLARIUS. O poor Fidele! Jove doth know what man Thou might'st have madeâthou died'st a most rare boy. Tell us how found you him? PALADOR. Stark as you see; And smiling thus, as if the dart of death Had gently tickl'd slumber; CADWAL. O sweet brother, With female fairies will thy tomb be haunted, And worms shall not come near thee.â PALADOR. With fair flow'rs (While summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele) I will adorn thy graveâThou shalt not lack The flow'r that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor The azur'd harebell like thy veins; no nor The leaf of eglantine, which, not to slander't, Out-sweeten'd not thy breathâThe ruddock would With charitable bill bring thee all this, Yea and furr'd moss besides, when flow'rs were none, To winter-gown thy corse.â BELLARIUS. Come, boys, have done, And play no more in wench-like words with that Which is so seriousâHence, and lay his corps Near good Euriphile's, your worthy mother'sâ PALADOR. Be't soâbut, Cadwal, first, albeit thy voice Has now the mannish crack, sing o'er his body In note and words like those which thou didst chaunt O'er good Euriphileâe'er she was lodg'd Within her leafy graveâCome onâbeginâ The DIRGE. Set by Mr. Arne, sung by Mr. Lowe. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun, Nor the furious winter's blast; Thou thy worldly task hast done, And the dream of life is past. Golden lads and girls all must Follow thee, and come to dust. Fear no more the frown o' th' great, Death doth mock the tyrant foe; Happiest is the early fate, Misery with time doth grow. Monarchs, sages, peasants must Follow thee, and come to dust. No exorciser harm thee! No spell of witchcraft charm thee! Grim ghost unlaid forbear thee! The fairy elves be near thee! Quiet consummation have, Unremoved be thy grave. BELLARIUS. These are our rural obsequies, Philarioâ PHILARIO. Most sweet and solemn, sir. BELLARIUS. When you've remov'd the body, back repair Here to the cave, and fit you for the field. âWe'll share our little armory among usâ And, sons, e'er ev'ning we'll forget this grief, And wipe our tear-stain'd cheeks with bloody hands. âCome, good Philarioâ [Exeunt severally.

So please your grace, it is my faith he will; We are already beaten in conceit, And pride does still forego his 'vantages. Best then halt here, my liege. CYMBELINE. Halt! give the word. (Within) Halt! halt! halt! halt! CYMBELINE. Our son not yet return'd! Oh! here comes one That was a limb o'th'party. What now, captain? Enter an Officer. OFFICER. My liege, prince Cloten far outstripp'd his train, And we're to seek the seekerâHis spurr'd horse We found upon the verge of yonder forest, But him no tidings speak of. CYMBELINE. Take thou his charge, And so bestir thee in the field, that none May think his valour missing. Well-how now? Enter another Officer. OFFICER. My liege, here are without four volunteers That seem to promise marvels, tho' their looks And garb be such as hermits wont to wear In most retired sequestration; They have bewitch'd the soldier's hearts, and crave Instant admittance to your Majesty. CYMBELINE. It doth amaze usâlet 'em come before usâ [Exit Lord, and returns with Bellarius, Palador, Cadwal, and Philario.

Mighty Cymbeline, Hermits we are, that have a homely dwelling Where want keeps houseâyet are we bold to boast Our hands and hearts as good as any he's, That dares look Roman in the face. CYMBELINE. Thy speech Gives earnest of much worthâSay, who are these The colleagues of your enterprize? BELLARIUS. Dread sir, These striplings are my sons; this worthy fellow Is kinsman of my wife'sâ PALADOR. First, let's go fight, And then to telling tales. CYMBELINE. So prompt, so young! Wast thou a soldier born? Is warlike science By inspiration caught, which still we judg'd By long experience learn'd? BELLARIUS. O royal sir, My boys are of a gen'rous breedâGreat Gods, When on my three-foot stool I sit, and tell The val'rous feats I've done, (for I am free Of this same trade of war) how will this youth, My first-born Palador, let his spirits fly Out at my story? âThus mine enemy fell, âAnd thus (say I) I set my foot on's neckââ Ev'n then the blood flows in his cheeks, he sweats, Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture That acts my wordsâHis younger brother Cadwal With ardour emulous, and as like a figure, Strikes life into my speech; and richly shews His great conceiving. CYMBELINE. In a time that look'd More perilous than this, such early virtue Would bode us issue fortunate to Britainâ Enter another Officer in haste. Soldier thy speed is big with consequenceâ Proclaim it with thy tongueâ OFFICER. To arms, my liege, The Roman legions are come down the hill, And their loud clarions sound to present battle.

Stretch your big hearts, my countrymen, and shout From the strong lungs of liberty, till air Wast your incessant clamours to the thrones Of the admiring Gods. (a great shout.) Remember, sirs, We go to fight for death, or victory.â O let us only live on terms of conquest Who dies, at least dies free-man, blessed dies To live immortal in his country's songsâ If there's a coward here, let him post back To his soft bed and caudleâI should weep Worse than a love-sick girl to find to-day Our hearts not of a pieceâCome on, brave fellows, For soldiers all are fellowsâWe'll yet live (Unless my sins abuse my divination) To see old Lud's Town bright with joyful fires, And Britons strut in triumphâSet we onâ [Exeunt.

O Philario, (For I well know thy friendship such, thou'st done The letter of my will) thou should'st have paus'dâ Anger is indiscreet in his commandsâ Too true, the noble Imogen did wrong me; (And so, I doubt not, did my mother him I call'd my father, tho' she still was held The non-pareil of virtue) yet her fault, The nat'ral failing of her sex, not hers, Was ill pusu'd with vengeance capital By meâO Britain, I have kill'd my wife, Who was thy mistressâtherefore thus array'd Like a poor soldier, neither known, nor guess'd at, Pitied or hated, to the face of peril Myself I'll dedicateâHeav'n knows my life Is ev'ry breath a death.

Great, tho' meanâ Noble obscure, we thank theeâwhat's thy name? LEONATUS. I cannot stay to tell theeâhear'st thou not How loud Mars bellows yonder?âonly thisâ The king has friends he knows notâfare you well, My sword will cool else.â [Exit Leonatus. CYMBELINE. What blunt fellow's this? We have no time to wonderâHow now, captain? Enter an Officer. OFFICER. Advance, my liegeâOur battle galls 'em sorelyâ Yon sage, and his boy-hermits fight like dragons. The Roman eagle flaps his wing for flight, And conquest smiles upon us. CYMBELINE. Follow me; And still the word be, Cymbeline, and Britain [Exeunt. Alarum. Fight. Enter Britons and Romans fighting.

Thou hast o'erpower'd me striplingâthe just Gods Unbrac'd my armâthe heaviness of guilt Took off my manhoodâI've bely'd a lady, The princess of this country; and the air on't Revengingly enfeebled me; brave youth, Witness the penance of my dying hour, And let the noble Leonatus know I crav'd in death his pardonâ PALADOR.

Thou hast the arm That heav'n does justice withâI can no moreâ Take thou this note of Cloten's (gives a note) it doth speak In terms full relative to the device Then hatching in his brain; and farther marks The lowly bendings of his love to CÃ¦sarâ This shall confirm thy by-and-by report Strongly as living evidenceâI've done More good in my last hour, than can be pick'd From my whole piece of lifeâthere's hope in that, And in that hope I dieâ (dies) PALADOR. Nay, if thou hop'st, I'll write despair down follyâJupiter, What a vile rogue was this? and yet he wore A worthy seemingâI perceive my garb Doth shame the guise o'th' worldâI will set out New fashion; less without, and more within. What have we here? (Flourish.) Enter Leonatus. LEONATUS. Hermit, our wars are done; The Romans turn their backs, and victory To-day is wedded to great Cymbeline. O that the joy of all should touch not me! I am not mortal sure; for death I sought, Yet found him not where I did hear him groan, Nor felt him where he struck. This ugly monster, 'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, smooth beds, Sweet words, and hath more ministers than we That draw his knives in war. PALADOR. Art thou a Briton, And dost not laugh to-day? Sad looks are treason, And take the part of Rome; the man that feels His own distress, hates more his pers'nal grief, Than he doth love his country. LEONATUS. O you know notâ Hah! who lies there? Ye Gods, it is Pisanioâ The damn'd Italian fiend that stain'd my honour; I would have sav'd an hundred lives in fight To have met his. PALADOR. If thou art Leonatus, (As by thy talk thou should'st be) I have matter For your quick hearing. LEONATUS. I am Leonatus, I would I were aught else! PALADOR. That villain there Did much abuse you, Sir. LEONATUS. He did abuse me Beyond the pow'r of all his worthless tribe To make amendsâWho robs me of my wealth, May one day have ability, or will To yield me, full repaymentâbut the villain That doth invade a husband's right in bed, Is murd'rer of his peace, and makes a breach In his life's after-quiet, that the grief Of penitence itself cannot repair. PALADOR. Thou dost mistake thy woe, good Leonatus, Which yet (if the great Gods are merciful) I have a cure forâ LEONATUS. How! where! which way! when! PALADOR. Sir, your belief in your dear lady's truth Is falsely wounded, who, be sure (for aught This arch impostor Roman could disprove) Has kept her bond of chastity uncrack'd, And is as cold as Dian. LEONATUS. Ay, and colder; For Dian is aliveâIf thou not fool'st me, Thou curest common sickness with the plague, And killest with reliefâI could not find The virtue of my wife untainted now, (That once I priz'd to adoration) For the best carbuncle of PhÅbus' wheel, Nay, all the worth of's car. PALADOR. Alas! I'm sorry Your much wrong'd judgment hath proceeded thus.â For free and full confession made this wretch Of most refined stratagem to change Your biass of affection: Sir, this note, Which with his dying hand he did bequeath you, Will more at large illustrate what my tongue Faulters in utt'rance of. (gives the note.) LEONATUS. Quick, let me see it, Impatient misery longs to know the worst, E'en when the worst is fatal. (reads) The Lord Cloten to the Roman Knight Pisanio. Cloten! the name is ominousâit bodes More than the raven's sullen flap that scents Cadaverous infirmity.âBut onâ If thou lov'st me, let me see thee ere night. I have bought the fidelity of the princess's woman with my gold; she will give thee admittance into her chamber, when nothing will be awake but anger and policy; where thou may'st make such note as will be sufficient to the madding of the abhorred Leonatus. Thy service herein will tie me closer to thyself, and to Augustus thy lord. No more till thou dost console with thy presence, thine and CÃ¦sar's in affection, Cloten. PALADOR. How fare you, sir? Alack! his grief is dumb. LEONATUS. Are there no Gods? or are they Gods that sleep, And leave us to ourselves?âOh! I have done itâ I've reach'd the point of shame, and villainy Is less than 'twas.âTwice doubly curst be he That first did graff the failings of his wife On a fool's head's suspicion.âI've destroy'd The temple of fair virtue, yea herselfâ Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set The dogs o'th' street to bait me; ev'ry fool Be Leonatus call'd. O! Imogen, My queen, my love my wife, oh! Imogen! PALADOR. Mark thou unhappy Briton, how my soul Catches thy griefâmy eyes half drown my tongue. Wifeâwhat is wife? what is it thou dost feel? The pang that gripes thee seems more keen than mine was, When my good mother, and Fidele died! âYet then I mourn'd heart-deepâO that thy woes Had remedy within the reach of power, I would pursue endeavours infinite 'Till rashness should be virtue. Pardon me This vain, vain boastâValour himself must weep When he cannot redressâI'll sit down by thee, And mourn 'till I beguile thee of thy sorrowsâ We'll give our shares in this day's triumph up To riot and hard-hearted jollity. O Imogen, where art thou?âsoftâhere comes Philario, my good uncle. Enter Philario. LEONATUS. How! Philario? O turn a thousand Romans loose upon me, But shew me not Philario. PHILARIO. Palador, Have we a madman here? LEONATUS. Ay, of thy making, Thou cred'lous fool, egregious murtherer, Thief, any thing, that's due to villains past, In being, or to come.â PHILARIO. I know thee not. LEONATUS. Know'st thou not Leonatus? PHILARIO. Art thou he? And dost thou greet me thus? LEONATUS. Where is my wife? My wife, my wife, my Imogen, thou villain! PHILARIO. Base and ungrateful! is it come to this? Have I then offer'd up my mind's repose, My better judgment, and my nature's pity, To thy injunction? Have I stain'd my sword With blood as rich as ever yet did wash A British heart, to be bequestion'd now With, villain, where's my wife, my Imogen? âBut that thy will was absolute herein, I could have wish'd the damned charge had aim'd At universal ruin of the sex, And her alone left out. LEONATUS. I'm wildâforgive me; I've kill'd my wife, and shall my friend escape Th' abuses of my fury?âRead, Philario, Read this black scroll, (gives him the letter) read it, and after tell me, If jealousy be written in the list Of sins that mercy reaches. PHILARIO. You're undone; And so am Iâcome not to me for comfort, For my own pers'nal grief out-measures all The patience I was born with. LEONATUS. Patience! who Is patient in despair? Can patience wake The sleep of death? Can it command old time To render back the hours he snatch'd away, Or what is done, make undone? Give me cord, Poison, or knife, some upright justicer, And then prescribe me patience. PALADOR. O Bellarius, Thy lectures all were true, and this world holds Nothing but woe and villainyâwhere's Cadwal? We'll homeward to the rock.â PHILARIO. Hold thee, young manâ The king must thank you for your servicesâ Anon he will be here; and, Leonatus, Do not, I pray, with rashness over-ripe A vi'lence on thyselfâbest wait we both The royal sentence on our lives, and die Without more folly on our headsâto me The op'ning leave of this. LEONATUS. Well, let me dieâ The rest you shall commandâI see her nowâ Bloody and pale she looksâher snow-white breast Whose fragrance sent up incense to the Gods, Is soil'd with clotted goreâher jetty locks, Where Cupid and a thousand graces play'd, Are turn'd to fury's snakesâand in her eye, At whose kind beams glad Hymen light his torch, Sits fiery vengeance now with direful looks Chilling my faculties. PHILARIO. If thou art man, Be like one nowâdie as a soldier should do, And do not start at shadowsâI've bethought me How we may fit and full disclosure make Of all our purposes to Cymbeline; Yea, and of Cloten's too, (whereof the truth Shall the king's heart sore smite) that devil Cloten Of whom this gallant youth has well reveng'd us. LEONATUS. Has he? who, what art thou, thou wond'rous man! To whom I am indebted for the scourge Of my two deadly foes. PHILARIO. He is a wonder Myself can scarce explain;âBut hark, the king.â (Flourish.) Let us, my wretched friend, appear a while, What our now-habits speak us. Enter Cymbeline, Bellarius, Cadwal, Lords, and Soldiers. CYMBELINE. Thanks to all; Chiefly to you, whom the great Gods have made Best pillars of my throne. Where are the rest? O here's your worthy kinsman, your brave son, And the poor soldier that in rags did shame Rich coats of war, and with his naked breast Stept before shields of proofâwe owe our life To his true valour. BELLARIUS. I did never see Such noble fury in so mean a thing; Such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought But begg'ry and bad luck. CYMBELINE. All bow your kneesâ (Bellarius, Philario, Palador, Cadwal and Leonatus kneel.) Arise, my knights o'th' battle; we create you Companions to our person, and will give you Estates becoming your new dignities. PALADOR. My Lord, the honour I have won to-day Is sustenance for meâI fought for fame, And riches give not thatâI'll carry home The strange experience of some seven hours, And live upon't hereafter. CADWAL. Most brave brother. CYMBELINE. We must not lose you so. PHILARIO. So please your grace, I would intreat a word. CYMBELINE. Say on, and freely. PHILARIO. Then, in the name of all our brotherhood, I do beseech your majesty to bless With your high presence our poor hermitage; Which (I am ready to make good the boast) Is fit to give a mighty monarch welcome, If cleanly wholesomeness, and simple plenty, Be worth your appetite; and, sir, the more I do solicit this, for that I have Much matter for your ear, which only there My spirit groans to utter.âMay I hope This invitation likes your majesty? CYMBELINE. Ay, passing well.âMy sirs, return you with A monarch in your trainâwe long to know What 'tis you would impartâcome thou brave fellow! (To Leonatus.) Some of you lords attend us, and the rest Abide here in the camp.âIs there close guard Upon the Roman prisoners? 1st LORD. My gracious liege, there is. CYMBELINE. 'Tis wellâHermit, lead on. [Exeunt Cymbelline, Bellarius, Philario, Palador, Cadwal, Leonatus, and Lords at one door, and other Lords at another. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE The Forest and Cave. Enter Palador, and Cadwal. PALADOR. Cadwal, once more all hail our happy home! I've seen enough of this wide world to day, To turn my back upon societyâ Saving the manly hardiments of war, There's nought on earth desirableâbut come, Do we our errand, and the cave prepare, (For therefore were we will'd to speed us first) For the reception of high majesty.â CADWAL. They will o'ertake us soonâ PALADOR. (Looking into the cave) Stay, come not inâ But that I know this figure, I should think It were a fairy. CADWAL. What's the matter, brother? PALADOR. By Jupiter, a spirit!âGods! one sand Another doth not more resemble, than This form the rosy lad who died, and was Fideleâ CADWAL. Ev'n the same dead thing aliveâ PALADOR. Peace, peace, see moreâhe eyes us notâforbearâ It is Fidele's ghostâ CADWAL. Hist! it comes forward! Enter Imogen from the cave. PALADOR. Cadwal, stand closeânay shake notâlook, it smiles. What art thou, beauteous vision, that dost take So sweet a formâthou can'st not mean us harm. Mischief ne'er travell'd in a shape like thatâ Art thou Fidele? speakâwhy hast thou left Thy flow'ry grave? why dost thou haunt our rock? Or art some spirit in his borrow'd likeness, That for thy merriment dost wear a semblance, Deluding us poor mortals?âGentle, speak.â IMOGEN. Give me your handsâI am your living brother, The true Fideleâ CADWAL. Can it be ye Gods! This is a day of wondersâ PALADOR. I'll no more Witness the thing I seeâart thou alive? Dear boy, I feel thou artâ (Embracing Imogen.) IMOGEN. Sirs, I did take A certain drowsy potion, that fast seiz'd The present pow'r of life; but in short time All offices of nature did again Resume due functions.âWherefore I took this, Hereafter askâand let me now demand, Where's good Bellarius? where's my uncle? why Those weapons at your sides? for thus you ne'er Equip'd for hunting. PALADOR. No, my dearest brother, We've been at better sport in the fair field, Where honour chases dangerâwhat we've done Fame shall set down in brass, and shew't to CÃ¦sar; And then 'twill task arithmetic to count All the wet cheeks in Rome. IMOGEN. How! have your rapiers Been drawn in battle? PALADOR. To victorious purposeâ The king is coming hitherâ IMOGEN. Hah! the king! What and who brings him? PALADOR. O your worthy uncle, Unknown, and in disguise; my father too, And a long lordly train; ere night, the book Of fate, wide open'd to inspection, Great secrets shall disclose.âHere comes Philario, The rest are not far off.âCadwal, we'll inâ Do you, Fidele, meet him here, and strike New matter of amazement to his heart. [Exeunt Palador and Cadwal into the cave. Enter Philario. PHILARIO. Fairest, and best of women, pardon me (kneeling) The tortures I have put thy virtue to In trial, not in malice.âO forgive me; For till thy lips have pass'd remission on me, Mine must be lock'd in silence. IMOGEN. Rise, Philario! Thy stratagem has more complexion in't Of wisdom, than of guiltâmy honour tried, I'm serv'd, and not offendedâThat same drug, Murd'rous awhile to sense, I thank'd thee for With the first breath I wak'd withâhence of that Put the remembrance byâMy brothers tell me Of something strange at hand.â PHILARIO. My gracious lady, Since last we parted, the big hours have teem'd With great, and sad eventsâpardon me, Gods, One fiction more.â (aside.) IMOGEN. Hast thou heard aught, Philario, Of Leonatus? What is in thy mind That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh From th'inward of thee? Speakâwhere is my husband? PHILARIO. Say he were deadâhis villainous intent Should cure thy present sorrow. IMOGEN. Thy supposing Confirms his death, and my hereafter woeâ Thou tell'st me he was jealous, false, and cruelâ Grant he had faults, yet they were faults that others Haply infus'd into his honest natureâ Grant he had faults, yet faults his future life Might have amended all.âBut, oh! this death Chills mortally, and with the scythe of winter Cuts down my spring of hopeâO Leonatus! PHILARIO. Nay, lady, mark meâHe did leave the world Without one drop of pity for your fate. I saw him down in fight, whereto his rage Had brought him, 'midst the hottest fumes of war To make a desp'rate end; and first explaining This hermit's garb, (which I to-day put on To cheat the wary eye of Cymbeline) Vow'd in the doing his will my heart Rebell'd against my hand. â'Tis well, he cry'd, âI go to meet the strumpet, and consign her âTo other fires than lust.â He said no more, But to the last breath'd anger. IMOGEN. If 'tis so,â Some dÃ¦mon, envious of his peace and mine, Did witch his sober judgment; nought but magic In subtle potency of transformation, Could ruin make of such a noble piece Of heav'nly workmanship. Gods! what is man When error outlives honour? Yet, Philario, I will remember the good thing he was, Ere fury bent him wrongwardsâWhat he did Let insolence, that wags his head in scorn O'er virtue fall'n, proclaimâbut never so Shall his poor wife reproach himâO my lord, Wise, valiant, gentle, constant, just, and true, The world did tack to thy all-honour'd name; Thou wert the mark that Jupiter did point to, When he prais'd mortal beings. PHILARIO. Noblest princess, What shall my wonder call thee?âthy great father Yet knows not half thy worthâhither he's coming; And I will put into his royal pow'r The now-disposal of our destiniesâ Lo, he is hereâBe silent, and attendâ Hail to king Cymbeline.â Enter Cymbeline, Bellarius, Leonatus, and Lords. CYMBELINE. We thank you, hermit.â BELLARIUS. Good heav'ns! Fidele living! PHILARIO. Histâa wordâ (Phil. whispers Bell.) CYMBELINE. In troth, this rock hath a most pleasant site To tempt a king from homeâO luxury, How art thou put to shame, if comfort lives Where lowliness inhabitsâour good hosts, Where are the valiant boys? PHILARIO. Dread sovereign, They shall come forth.âHo! Cadwal! Palador! Enter Cadwal and Palador from the Cave. And now, so please your highness, I will ope, Before you do betake you to repast, A volume of high marvels to your ear. CYMBELINE. Pray you begin. PHILARIO. First know then, mighty sir, He, that addresses here your royal presence, No hermit is, but your true slave Philario.â Nay, start not, sir, but know all criminals, And then proceed to justiceâhere is one (pointing to Leonatus.) Has travell'd far to meet your fierce displeasure, Yet once deserv'd your graceâ LEONATUS. Ay, I am heâ No beggar, king, but yet a wretch more curst Than ever fortune spurn'd at.âKnow'st me not? Send for ingenious torturers; command The art of cruelty to practise on me, For I do all abhorred things amend By being worse than they.âKnow'st me not yet? The villain that did steal thy princely daughter; (Yet that was theft for Gods!) the damned villain That, in a fit of jealous lunacy, Murder'd all precious qualities that man Loves woman forâthatâ IMOGEN. (running, and laying hold of her.) Peace, my lord, hear, hearâ LEONATUS. Shall's have a play of this? thou scornful page Come not athwart my griefâ (strikes her.) PHILARIO. Hold, Leonatus, Or thou wilt murder do, who art so hurt In a conceit 'tis doneâWhy gaze you so? Didst thou not hear her speak? and know'st thou not The tune of Imogen? CYMBELINE. The rock goes round. PHILARIO. Nay, wonder is the gen'ral word to all! You that ne'er lov'd, look on that virtuous pairâ Mark! how he anchors upon Imogen! See! how she hangs on Leonatus' arm! While both are mute in sweet extremity Of truest love, and joy! LEONATUS (after a pause.) Joy! who names joy?â It is a word too coldâWhat heav'n shall be Hereafter, I feel nowâWhom had I lost, But Imogen?âWhom did I hold corrupt, But Imogen?âWhom did I drive to death, But Imogen?âYet Imogen is foundâ Yet Imogen is purer than the star That leads her virgin train to light the mornâ Yet Imogen still lives, and lives to love me!â âDivide all matter of discourse among youâ What can I say or think but Imogen! IMOGEN. How do the gracious Gods hide kindness, 'neath The fable veil of sad appearances? O Leonatus! had we never parted, Had I ne'er stood the mark of thy revenge, Ne'er had we known what 'tis to meet again, What 'tis to meet again in life, and love! (Embrace.) PALADOR. Why so, farewel The boy Fidele! I begin to fear I shall hold manhood vile, for sure the graces, Which fair perfection is compounded of, Are all bound up in woman! princely Imogen, Altho' thou art the daughter of a king, I have ambition in me, that could wish To call thee sister.â BELLARIUS. Wond'rous nature still! (aside.) PALADOR. My sword has from their hearts drawn the best blood Of those you're little bound toâand I'll wear it, Whilst it is mine, for your protection, ladyâ PHILARIO. I do believ'tâenoughânow Cymbeline Wait we your royal sentenceâfor myself, That I have cover'd honesty with guile, In which I had in aim the gen'ral good, I rather sue for thanks from all, than pardonâ For this my friend, (points to Leonatus)âdread Sir, your clearest judgment Has seal'd his virtue sterling; and albeit In jealous mood he did conceive an act That tenderness calls terrible, yet think I, His jealousy had ground more seeming sure, Than common frenzy treads onâ PALADOR. Sir, I know it. PHILARIO. Well, by-and-byâfor this unparagon'd, She'as cur'd me of some spleen against her sex; I've prov'd her (as anon at large you'll hear IMOGEN. When we shall make past terrors our disport,) PHILARIO. The sweetest lady; and the truest wife, That ever swore her faithâyour sentence, sir, Which I forestal a kind one. CYMBELINE. Since 'tis thus, I will not counteract the mighty Gods In what they have ordainedâMy children, take Full pardon in a blessingâheaven's good gifts Fall on your heads like dew! LEONATUS. Thus on our kneesâ (Leonat. and Imogen kneel.) Take we with pious thankfulness the bounty. My Imogen!â IMOGEN. My Leonatus! BOTH. Oh!â (Embracing.) PHILARIO. How glutton-like thou dost devour thy joy, And can'st not spare one morsel to a friend! LEONATUS. O yes, to theeâfor 'tis to thee I owe The bliss that I am wild withâO believe me, Scarce went that angry mandate from my hand, But my repentance fetch'd it back, e'en tho' I thought my bride-bed stain'd with violationâ I landed 'midst a herd of vulgar Romans, In hope to intercept the fell revenge That freighted thy commission, or myself To barter life of future wretchedness For death of present gloryâ CYMBELINE. Well resolv'dâ But still there doth remain behind Philario, Long maze to be unravell'dâwho are these? This old man and his boys? How join'd you them? Or knowst thou aught of Cloten, our dear son? Upon whose widow'd hopes we're bound in honour To shed some comfortâhim we shall endow with A moiety of this fair realmâ PALADOR. What him! Would you make puppets princes? I'm right glad (Your pardon king) he will not heed your offerâ CYMBELINE. Say'st thou bold boy? PALADOR. If honesty is boldness, I am a lionâto be brief, my lordâ Wherefore that frown? I was not born to stand In awe of eye-browsâYour son Cloten ranks 'Mongst those that were your subjectsâ CYMBELINE. How is this? Stripling bewareâwho trifles with a king Plays with his perilâ PALADOR. He is deadâI slew himâ Upon the very spot thou standst, I slew himâ The foulest blood my hand has spilt is hisâ Monarch, thou knew'st him notâ CYMBELINE. Audacious boy! Thou hast condemn'd thyselfâand spight of all That thou hast done to-day, dost from my lips Pluck a hard sentenceâthou must dieâ PALADOR. Hah! hah! Die, Sir! why then let treason be true service, And loyalty make capitalâI'm sorry To anger youâbut the bare name of Cloten Untunes my spirits; my enraged soul Catches like tinder at it; it doth fret me, And make me quarrelous and testy as Infirmity untendedâGood Philario, Produce thy scrollâ PHILARIO. Marry, and willingly. (Gives Cloten's letter.) So please your grace read this. It doth contain Matter important to the point. (Cymbeline reads.) Good Sirs, Comes it within the compass of belief, Such wisdom and such valour e'er could grow Beneath so poor a roof?âThis virtuous hermit Is fit to train up emperorsâThese youthsâ But peaceâthe king CYMBELINE. This letter, sir, whence came it? PALADOR. My lord, Pisanio, with his dying hand Lodg'd it in mineâ CYMBELINE. It doth appear by this, That Cloten villainous connection held With the new-beaten CÃ¦sarâI'm abus'd, And fool is he that thinks the heart of man Hangs at his tongueâloudly this caitif roar'd For Britain, and for me; and when he breath'd His am'rous plaints, pin'd like a nightingale.â This mischief-breeding serpent! Palador, We thank thy valour, tho' thy tongue was rude In roughness of reply. PALADOR. If I have valour, It is my nature, sir, for my harsh language I learn'd it 'mongst these rocks. CYMBELINE. We would know more Of who, and what thou artâBellarius speak, Make full discov'ry of yourselves, and fortunes, And end our present wonders. BELLARIUS. It is meet Your will should be obey'dâMy sons, I must For my own part unfold much dang'rous truth, Tho' haply well for youâ PALADOR. Your danger's ours. CADWAL. And our good your's. BELLARIUS. Most mighty Cymbeline! Thou hadst a subject that was Edwin call'd. CYMBELINE. Edwin! ay, what of him? a banish'd traitorâ BELLARIUS. Indeed, a banish'd man, but not a traitor; For I am heâ CYMBELINE. The whole world shall not save him! Lords bear him henceâ BELLARIUS. Nay, not so hot, great kingâFirst pay me for The breeding of thy sonsâ CYMBELINE. Breeding my sons! BELLARIUS. I am too blunt, and saucy; here's my knee; E'er I arise, I will prefer my sons, (kneels.) Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir, These two young gentlemen, that call me father, Are the true issue of your royal loins, And blood of your begetting. CYMBELINE. How! my issue! BELLARIUS. So sure, as you your sire's. These noble princes (For such and so they are) these twenty years Have I train'd up; such arts they have as I Could put into themâSir, my breeding was As your grace knowsâTheir nurse Euriphile, Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children Upon my banishment. The loss of these The more by you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd Unto my end of stealing them; the vengeance Of slander'd loyaltyâbut, royal sir, Here are your sons again; and I must lose Two of the sweet'st companions in the worldâ Heaven's grace be with them both, for they are worthy To in-lay heav'n with stars. CYMBELINE. Thou weep'st, and speak'stâ I lost my children, and if these be they They are a pair of worthies. BELLARIUS. Sir, your patienceâ This gentleman whom I call Palador, Most worthy prince, as your's, is true Guiderius; This gentleman, my Cadwal, is Arviragus, Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapt In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand Of his queen mother, which for more probation I can with ease produce. CYMBELINE. Guiderius had Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star; It was a mark of wonder. BELLARIUS. This is he, Who hath upon him still that nat'ral stamp; It was wife nature's end in the donation To be his evidence now. CYMBELINE. 'Tis he! 'tis he! O sure to-day the Gods do mean to strike me To death with mortal joyâ(Embracing Palador and Cadwal.) My sons! my sons! O Imogen! my child, thou'st found two brothers, But thou hast lost a kingdom. IMOGEN. No, my lord, I've got two worlds by this. O my dear brothers, Do we meet thus? oh! never say hereafter But I am truest speaker.âYou call'd me brother, When I was but your sister; I, you brothers, When you were so indeed. PALADOR. Why e'en let honour Come, as the Gods foresay it; I'm a prince But still the British Palador a sweet sister, The moiety my father meant for Cloten Is thine, and thy brave lord's, if my request, The first I make, be grantedâthee, Bellarius, We must at leisure thank; and you, Philario, We shall set down our friend; dear brother Cadwal, (I can't yet call thee by that other name) Thou shalt be part'ner of my royalty; We'll turn our hermitage into a temple, And yearly smoak it with our sacrifices. CADWAL. Agreed! O never was a day like this! CYMBELINE. Laud we the Gods!âBellarius, be our brother. Sirs, we are much indebted to you all, And we will shew it in our courtesiesâ Come, let us in, and to more joyous feast Than princes e'er regal'd atâIn your stories, Of which th' abridgement fills us with amazement, Distinction shall be richâto-morrow, sirs, We will to Lud's Town marchâCÃ¦sar shall pay Large ransom for the lives we have in hold, And sue to us for termsâne'er war did cease, With fairer prospect of a glorious peace.
