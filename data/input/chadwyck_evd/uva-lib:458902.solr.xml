      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi ScÃ¦na pma Antiochus stoic? in philosophers habits. Chrysalus [(wt h a writing Â«&amp;Â» penÂ«yÂ»] Syrus. Geta. bondeme Stoic?: You are now in sight of Carthage, that greate Cittie wch in Her empires vastnesse rivalls Rome at her prowde height. two howers will bringe you thither. make vse of what you haue learnde in your longe travayles, and from the golden principles read to you in th'Athenian Academie, stand resolude for either fortune. you must now forget the contemplations of a private man and put in action that wch may complie with the maiestie of a monarch. Antiochus: How that title, that glorious attribute of maiestie that troublesome, thowgh most trivmphant robe designde mee in my birth, wch I haue worne with terror, and astonishement to others affrights mee now! o memorie! memorie! of what I was once! when the easterne worlde with wonder in my may of youth look'd on mee. embassadors of the most potent kinges with noble Ã¦mulation contendinge to court my freindship, their faire daughters offer'd as pledges to assure it with all pompe and circumstance of glorie. Rome her selfe, and Carthage Ã¦mulous, whose side I showlde confirme in my protection. o remembrance with what ingenious crueltie, and tortures out of a due consideration of my present, lowe, and desperate condition do'st thou afflicte mee now! [Hermit] [stoicqe:] you must oppose (for soe the stoic? discipline com?andes you) that wisdome, with your pacyence fortefi'd wch holdes dominion over fate, against the torrent of your passion. Antiochus: I showlde, I doe confesse I shoulde yf I cowlde drincke vp that river of forgetfullnesse Poets dreame of. But still in dreadfull formes, (Philosophie wantinge power to remoue 'em) all those innocent spirits borroweinge againe their bodies gash'de with woundes (wch strowde Achaias bloodie plaines, and made rivoletts of gore) appeare to mee exactinge a stricte accompte of my ambitious follye for the exposinge of twelue thowsande soules (whoe fell that fatall day) to certaine ruine. neither the counsaile of the Persian kinge prevaylinge with mee, nor the graue advice of my wise enemie Marcus Scaurus hindringe my desperate enterprise to late repented. mee thinckes I now looke on my butcherd armie. Stoic?: this is meere melancholye. Antiochus: o 'tis more Sr heere, there, and every where they doe pursue mee. The Genivs of my cuntrie, made a slaue like a weepinge mother seemes to kneele before mee wringeinge her manacled handes; the hopefull youth, and braverie of my kingedome in their pale, and ghastlye lookes lamentinge that they were to soone by my meanes forc'd from their sweete beeinge. olde men with siluer lockes in vain Â«th Â» traynÂ«enÂ» all delights, or sacred to the chaÂ«steÂ» Dianas rites, compelde to bowe to the souldiers [greedie] lusts, or at an outcrie solde vnder the speare, like beasts, to be spurnde, and trod on by their prowde mistrisses the Roman matrons. o sr consyder [sir] then yf it can bee in the constancie of a stoic? to indure what now I suffer. [Antiochus:] stoic?: two and twentye yeares travaylinge ore the worlde you haue pay'd the forfeite of this ingagement, &amp; [and] shed a sea of teares in your sorrowe for it; and now beeinge call'd from the rigour of a stricte philosophers life by the cries of your poore cuntrie, you are bounde with an obedient cheerefullnesse to follow the path that you are enter'd in: wch will guide you out of a wildernesse of horror to the flourishinge plaines of safetie, the iust gods smoothinge the way before you. Antiochus: thowgh I grant that all impossibilities are easie to their omnipotence, gieue mee leaue to feare the more then doubtfull issue. can it fall in the compasse of my hopes the lordlye Romans soe longe possessde of Asia, [his] their plea made good by conquest, and that ratefide with their relligious authoritie the propagation of the co?on welth to whose increase they are sworne to, will ere part with a pray soe pretious, and deerelye purchasde. A Tigresse circlde with her famishd whelpes will sooner yeelde a lambe snatchde from the flocke to the dumbe oratorie of the ewe then Rome restore one foote of earth that may diminishe her vast empire Stoic?: In her will this may bee granted: but you haue a title soe stronge, and cleare, that there's noe colour left to varnishe Romes pretences. ad this sr. the Asian princes warn'd by your example and yet vnconque'rd, never will consent that such a foule example of iniustice shall to the scandall of the present age hereafter bee recorded. they in this are equallie ingag'd with you, and must thowgh not in loue to iustice for their safetie in policie assist, garde, and protecte you and you may rest assur'd neither the kinge of Parthia, the Gauls, nor big bonde Germans nor this greate Carthage growne alreadie iealous of Romes incrochinge empire will crie aime to such an vsurpation, wch must take from their owne securitie. besides your mother was a Roman for her sake and the famelies from wch shee is deriud you must finde favour. Antiochus: for her sake alas sr ambition knowes noe kinred, right, and lawfull was never yet founde as a marginall note in the blacke booke of profit. I am suncke to lowe to bee bouyde vp, it beeinge helde a foolishe weakenesse, and disease in statists in favour of a weakeman to provoke such as are mightie; the imperious waues Â«fÂ» callamities e alreadie swÂ«?Â»lne a will [10 lines] An [5 lines] Chry [2 lines] Get [4 lines] Syru [5 lines] Get [2 lines] Syru [1 line] Geta [2 lines] Chrysalus [7 lines] w Syrus: hau a k Chrysalus: a ki alas [buri] [buriedâ]all in tr to mÂ«eÂ» this is Geta: wee kn Chrysalus: but wh to bee noe soon shall forÂ«gÂ» Hee's pr all that Syrus:, [Geta:-] Humph.

Ha! what is containde in this wast paper? 'tis indor'sde reads:â to the noe kinge Antiochus. and subscribde noe more thy servant but superior.

I that was borne, and bred vp a kinge, whose frowne, or smile spake death, or life, my will a law; my person environde with an armie; now exposde to the contempt, and scorne of my owne slaue whoe in his pride, as a god compar'd with mee bids mee become a begger. but complaynts are weake, and womanishe. I will like a palme tree growe vnder my huge waight: nor shall the feare of death, or torture, that deiection bringe to make me liue, or dye, lesse then a kinge. exit. scÃ¦na secunda. Berecinthivs a flamen. 3 Asian marchants. 1 marchant: wee are growne soe contemptible, hee disdaines to gieue vs hearinge. 2. marchant: keepes vs of at such distance and with his Roman gravitie declines our sude for conference, as with much more ease wee might make our approches to the Parthian without a present, then worke hym to haue a feelinge of our grievances. 3 marchant: a statesman? the divell I thincke, whoe onlye knowes hym truelye can gieue his character when Hee is to determine a poynt of iustice. His wordes fall in measure like plu?ets of a clocke, observinge time and iust proportion. 1 marchant: but when Hee is to speake in any cawse concernes hym selfe or Romes republi?, like a gushinge torrent not to bee stopp'd in it's full course, his reasons deliverd like a seconde Mercurie breke in and be de wÂ«hatsÂ»oever is oppos'd agaist 'em. 2 marchant: when Hee smiles, let such beware, as haue to doe with hym, for then sans doubt Hee's bent to mischeife. Berecinthius: as I am Cybeles flamen, whose most sacred image drawne thus in pompe I weare vpon my brest, I am priveledgde, nor is it in his power to doe mee wronge, and hee shall finde I can chant, and alowd to when I am not at her altar kneelinge. mother of the gods what is hee. at his best but a Patritian of Rome, His name Titus flaminivs, and speake mine Berecinthivs Archflamen to Cybele[s] it makes as greate a sownde. 3 marchant: trewe but his place sr and the power it carries in it, as Romes legate gieues hym preheminence ore you. Berecinthius: not an atome. when morall honestie, and ius gentium faile to lende reliefe to such as are oppresd relligion must vse her strength. I am perfit in theis notes you gaue mee. doe they contayne at full your grievances, and losses. 1 marchant: woulde they were as well redresd, as they are punctuallie deliver'd to you. Berecinthius: say noe more they shall &amp; to the purpose. 2 marchant: Heere hee comes. [enter Titus flaminivs. Calistus. Demetrius. 2 freedmen.] Berecinthius: haue at hym. flaminius: blowe away theis troublesome &amp; importunate drones I haue embrions of greater consequence in my imaginations to wch I must gieue life, and forme, not now vouchsafinge to heare their idle buzzes. 1 marchant: note you that. Berecinthivs yes I doe note it, but the flamen is not soe light to bee remou'd by a groomes breath I must, and will speake, and I thus confront hym flaminivs: but that the image of the goddesse wch thow wearst vpon thy brest protects thy rudenesse, it had forfeyted thy life. dost thou not tremble when an incensed Roman frownes. Berecinthius: I see noe Gorgon in your face. flaminivs: must I speake in thunder before thow wilt bee awde? Berecinthivs: I rather looke for reverence from thee, yf thow respectest the goddesse power and in her name I charge thee to gieue mee hearinge. yf theis lyons rore for thy contempt of her expecte a vengeance sutable to thy pride. flaminivs: thow shalt orecome. theres noe contendinge with thee. 3 marchant: hitherto the flamen hath the better 1 marchant: but I feare Hee will not keepe it.

Prusias: I will bee first heard. shall I for your endes infringe my princelye word? or breake the lawes of hospitalitie? defeate my selfe of the certaine honor to restore a kinge vnto his owne? and what you Romans haue extorted, and keepe from hym? far bee it from mee I will not buy your amitie at such losse. soe it bee to all after times remembred I held it not sufficient to liue as one borne only for my selfe, and I desire noe other monument. flaminivs I grant it is a spetious thinge to leaue behinde vs a faire report, thowgh in the other world wee haue noe feelinge of it, &amp; to lende a desperate, thowgh fruitlesse ayde, to such as fate not to bee alterd hath markd out examples of callamitie, may appeare a glorious ornament, but heer's a man the oracle of your kingedome that can tell you when there's noe probabilitie it may be effected 'tis meere madnesse to attempt it.

Prusias: my power? flaminivs: is not to bee disputed yf waighd truelye with the pettie kinges your neighbours but when ballancd with the globes, and scepters of my mistris Rome will but I spare comparisons. but you builde on your strength to iustefie the fact. alas it is a feeble reede, &amp; leaninge on it will wounde your hande much sooner then support you. you keepe in pay tis true some peace traynd troopes wch awe your neighbours but consyder when our egles shall display their sayle stretchde winges hoveringe ore our legions, what defence can you expecte from yours? Philoxenus: vrge that poynt home. flaminivs: our olde victorious bandes are ever readie, &amp; such as are not our confÃ¦derates, tremble to thincke where next the storme shall fall with horror. Philoxenus knowes it. will you to helpe one you shoulde contemne, and is not worth your pittie pull it on your owne head? your neighbour Carthage would smile to see your error. let mee paynt the danger to you ere it come, imagine our legions, and th'auxiliarie forces of such [such] as are our freinds, and tributaries drawne vp, Bithinia cover'd with our [troopes] armies. all places promisinge defence blockde vp with our armd troopes; the siege continewinge; famine within, and force without disablinge all opposition; then the armie enter'd (as victorie is insolent) the rapes of virgins, and graue matrons; reverend old men with their last grones accusinge you, your cittie, and pallace sackd.
