      <field name="fulltext">Enters Rasni king of Niniuie, with three kings of Cicilia, Creet, and Paphlagonia, from the ouerthrow of Ieroboam, King of Ierusalem. So pace ye on triumphant warriours, Make Venus Lemm? armd in al his pomp, Bash at the brightnesse of your hardy lookes, For you the Viceroyes and the Caualires, That wait on Rasnies royall mightinesse: Boast pettie kings, and glorie in your fates, That stars haue made your fortuns clime so high, To giue attend on Rasnies excellency. Am I not he that rules great Niniuie, Rounded with Lycas siluer flowing streames, Whose Citie large Diametri containes, Euen three daies iournies length from wall to wall, Two hundreth gates carued out of burnisht brasse, As glorious as the portoyle of the Sunne, And for to decke heauens battlements with pride, Six hundreth Towers that toplesse touch the cloudes: This Citie is the footestoole of your King, A hundreth Lords do honour at my feete, My scepter straineth both the poralels, And now to t'enlarge the highnesse of my power, I haue made Iudeas Monarch flee the field, And beat proud Ieroboam from his holds, Winning from Cades to Samaria, Great Iewries God that foild stout Benhadab, Could not rebate the strength that Rasni brought, For be he God in heauen, yet Uiceroyes know, Rasni is God on earth and none but he. Cicilia. If louely shape, feature by natures skill, Passing in beautie faire Endymions, That Luna wrapt within her snowy brests, Or that sweet boy that wrought bright Venus bane, Transformde vnto a purple Hiacynth, If beautie Nunpareile in excellence, May make a King match with the Gods in gree, Rasni is God on earth, and none but hee. Creet. If martiall lookes wrapt in a cloud of wars More fierce then Mars, lightneth fro his eyes Sparkling reuenge and dyre disparagement: If doughtie deedes more haughtie then any done, Seald with the smile of fortune and of fate, Matchlesse to manage Lance and Curtelex. If such high actions grac'd with victories, May make a King match with the Gods in gree, Rasni is God on earth, and none but he. Paphlag. If Pallas wealth. Rasni. Uiceroyes inough, Paphlagon no more, See wheres my sister faire Remilia, Fairer then was the virgin Dania, That waits on Venus with a golden show, She that hath stolen the wealth of Rasnes lookes, And tide his thoughts within her louely locks, She that is lou'd, and loue vnto your King, See where she comes to gratulate my fame. Enters Radagon with Remilia, sister to Rasni, Aluia wife to Paphlagon, and other Ladies, bring a Globe seated in a ship. Remilia. Uictorious Monarch, second vnto Ioue, Mars vpon earth, and Neptune on the Seas, Whose frowne stroyes all the Ocean with a calme, Whose smile, drawes Flora to display her pride, Whose eye holds wanton Venus at a gaze, Rasni the Regent of great Niniuie, For thou hast foyld proud Ieroboams force, And like the mustering breath of Æolus, That ouerturnes the pines of Libanon, Hast scattered Iury and her vpstart groomes, Winning from Cades to Samaria, Remilia greets thee with a kinde salute, And for a present to thy mightinesse, Giues thee a Globe folded within a ship, As King on earth, and Lord of all the Seas, With such a welcome vnto Niniuie As may thy sisters humble loue afford. Rasni. Sister. The title fits not thy degree, A higher state of honour shall be thine, The louely Trull that Mercury intrapt, Within the curious pleasure of his tongue, And she that basht the sun-god with her eyes, Faire Semele the choise of Venus maides, Were not so beautious as Remilia. Then sweeting, sister shall not serue the turne, But Rasnes wife, his Lemmon and his loue. Thou shalt like Iuno wed thy selfe to Ioue, And fold me in the riches of thy faire, Remilia shall be Rasnes Paramour. For why if I be Mars for warlike deeds, And though bright Venus for thy cleare aspect, Why should not from our loynes issue a sonne, That might be Lord of royall soueraigntie? Of twentie worlds, if twentie worlds might be, What saist Remilia, art thou Rasnes wife? Remilia. My heart doth swell with fauour of thy thoughts, The loue of Rasni maketh me as proud As Iuno when she wore heauens Diademe. Thy sister borne, was for thy wife by loue, Had I the riches nature locketh vp, To decke her darling, beautie when she smiles, Rasni should prancke him in the pride of all. Rasni. Remelias loue, is farre more either prisde, Then Ieroboams or the worlds subdue, Lordings, ile haue my weddings sumptuous, Made glorious with the treasures of the world, Ile fetch from Albia shelues of Margarites, And strip the Indies of their Diamonds, And Tyre shall yeeld me tribute of her gold, To make Remelias wedding glorious, Ile send for all the Damosell Queenes that liue Within the reach of Rasnies gouernment, To wait as hand maides to Remelia, That her attendant traine may passe the troupe That gloried Venus at her wedding day. Creete. Oh my Lord, not sister to thy loue, Tis incest and too foule a fact for Kings, Nature allowes no limits to such lust. Rada. Presumptuous Uiceroy, darst thou check thy Lord, Or twit him with the lawes that nature loues, Is not great Rasni aboue natures reach, God vpon earth, and all his will is law. Creet. Oh flatter not, for hatefull is his choise, And sisters loue will blemish all his worth. Radag. Doth not the brightnesse of his maiestie, Shadow his deeds from being counted faults. Rasni Well hast thou answered within Radon, I like thee for thy learned Sophistri, But thou of Creet, that countercheckst thy King, Packe hence in exile, giue Radagon thy Crowne, Be thee Uicegerent of his royaltie? And faile me not in what my thoughts may please, For from a begger haue I brought thee vp, And gracst thee with the honour of a Crowne, Ye quandam king, what feed ye on delaies? Creete. Better no King then Uiceroy vnder him That hath no vertue to maintaine his Crowne. Rasni. Remilias, what faire dames be those that wait Attendant on my matchlesse royaltie? Remilia. Tis Aluia, the faire wife to the king of Paphlagonia. Rasni. Trust me she is a faire: thou hast Paphlagon a Iewell, To fold thee in so bright a sweetings armes. Rad. Like you her my Lord? Rasni. What if I do Radagon? Rada. Why then she is yours my Lord, for marriage Makes no exception, where Rasni doth command. Paphla. Ill dost thou counsell him to fancy wiues. Rada. Wife or not wife, what so he likes is his. Rasni. well answered Radagon thou art for me, Feed thou mine humour, and be still a king. Lords go in tryumph of my happie loues, And for to feast vs after all our broiles, Frolicke and reuell it in Niniuie. Whatsoeuer befitteth your conceited thoughts, Or good or ill, loue or not loue my boyes, In loue, or what may satisfie your lust, Act it my Lords, for no man dare say no. Smith. Denesum imperium, Cum Ioue nunc teno. Exeunt. Enters brought in by an Angell Oseas the Prophet, and set downe ouer the Stage in a Throne. Angell. Amaze not man of God, if in the spirit Th'art brought from Iewry vnto Niniuie, So was Elias wrapt within a storme, And set vpon mount Carnell by the Lord, For thou hast prcacht long to the stubborne Iewes, Whose flintie hearts haue felt no sweet remorse, But lightly valuing all the threats of God, Haue still perseuerd in their wickednesse. Loe I haue brought thee vnto Niniuie, The rich and royall Cittie of the world, Pampred in wealth, and ouergrowne with pride, As Sodome and Gomorrha full of sin, The Lord lookes downe and cannot see one good, Not one that couets to obey his will, But wicked all, from Cradle to the Church. Note then Oseas all their greeuous sinnes, And see the wrath of God that paies reuenge. And when the ripenesse of their sin is full, And thou hast written all their wicked through, Ile carrie thee to Iewry, backe againe, And seate thee in the great Ierusalem, There shalt thou publish in her open streetes, That God sends downe his hatefull wrath for sin, On such as neuer heard his Prophets speake, Much more will he inflict a world of plagues, On such as heare the sweetnesse of his voice, And yet obey not what his Prophets speake, Sit thee Oseas pondring in the spirit, The mightinesse of these fond peoples sinnes, Oseas. The will of the Lord be done. Exit. Angell. Enters the Clowne and his crew of Ruffians, to go to drinke. Ruffian. Come on Smith, thou shalt be one one of the crew, because thou knowest where the best Ale in the Towne is. Smith. Come on, in faith my colts, I haue left my M. striking of a heat, and stole away, because I would keep you company. Clowne. Why, what shall we haue this paltrie Smith with vs? Smith. Paltry Smith, why you incarnatiue knaue, what are you, that you speak pettie treason against the Smiths trade? Clowne. Why slaue, I am a gentleman of Niniuie. Smith. A Gentleman good sir, I remember you well and al your progenitors, your father bare office in our towne, an honest man he was, and in great discredit in the parish, for they bestowed two squires liuings on him, the one was on working dayes, and then he kept the towne stage, and on holidaies they made him the Sextens man, for he whipt dogs out of the Church. Alas sir, your father, why sir mee-thinks I see the Gentleman stil, a proper youth he was faith, aged some foure &amp; ten, his beard Rats colour, halfe blacke, halfe white, his nose was in the highest degree of noses, it was nose Autem glorificam, so set with Rubies, that after his death it should haue bin nailed vp in Copper-smiths hall for a monument. Well sir, I was beholding to your good father, for he was the first man that euer instructed me in the mysterie of a pot of Ale. 2. Well said Smith, that crost him ouer the thumbs. Clowne. Uillaine were it not that we goe to be merrie, my rapier should presently quit thy opproprious termes. Smith O Peter, Peter, put vp thy sword I prithie heartily into thy scabbard, hold in your rapier, for though I haue not a long reacher, I haue a short hitter. Nay then gentlemen stay me, for my choller begins to rise against him: for mark the words of a paltry Smith, Oh horrible sentence, thou hast in these words I will stand to it, libelled against all the sound horses, whole horses, sore horses, Coursers, Curtalls, Iades, Cuts, Hacknies, and Mares: wherevpon my friend, in their defence, I giue thee this curse, thou shalt be worth a horse of thine owne this seuen yeare. 1. Clowne. I prithie Smith is your occupation so excellent? Smith A paltry Smith, why ile stand to it, a Smith is Lord of the foure elements, for our iron is made of the earth, our bellowes blowe out aire, our flore holdes fire, and our forge water. Nay sir, we reade in the Chronicles, that there was a God of our occupation. Clowne. I, but he was a Cuckold. Smith That was the reason sir he cald your father cousin, paltry smith, why in this one word thou hast defaced their worshipful occupation. Clowne. As how? Smith Marrie sir I will stand to it, that a Smith in his kinde is a Phisition, a Surgion and a Barber. For let a Horse take a cold, or be troubled with the bots, and we straight giue him a poti? or a purgation, in such phisicall maner that he mends straight, if he haue outward diseases, as the spuing, splent, ring-bone, windgall or fashion, or sir a galled back, we let him blood &amp; clap a plaister to him with a pestilence, that mends him with a verie vengeance, now if his mane grow out of order, and he haue any rebellious haires, we straight to our sheeres and trim him with what cut it please vs, pick his eares and make him neat, marry indeed sir, we are slouens for one thing, we neuer vse any musk-balls to wash him with, &amp; the reason is sir, because he can woe without kissing. Clowne. Well sirrha, leaue off these praises of a Smyth, and bring vs to the best Ale in the towne. Smith Now sir I haue a feate aboue all the Smyths in Niniuie, for sir, I am a Philosopher that can dispute of the nature of Ale, for marke you sir, a pot of ale consists of foure parts, Imprimis the Ale, the Toast, the Ginger and the Nutmeg. Clowne. Excellent. Smith The Ale is a restoratiue, bread is a binder, marke you sir two excellent points in phisicke, the Ginger, oh ware of that: the philosophers haue written of the nature of ginger, tis expulsitiue in two degrees, you shal here the sent?ce of Galen, it wil make a man belch, cough, &amp; fart, and is a great comfort to the heart, a proper poesie I promise you, but now to the noble vertue of the Nutmeg, it is saith one Ballad, I think an English Roman was the authour, an vnderlayer to the braines, for when the Ale giues a buffet to the head, oh the Nutmeg that keepes him for a while in temper. Thus you see the discription of the vertue of a pot of Ale, now sir to put my phisicall precepts in practise follow me, but afore I step any further. Clowne. Whats the matter now? Smith Why seeing I haue prouided the Ale, who is the puruaior for the wenches, for maisters take this of me, a cup of Ale without a wench, why alasse tis like an egge without salt, or a red hering without musterd. Clowne Lead vs to the Ale, weele haue wenches inough I warrant thee. Oseas. Iniquitie seekes out companions still, And mortall men are armed to do ill: London looke on, this matter nips thee neere, Leaue off thy ryot, pride and sumptuous cheere. Spend lesse at boord, and spare not at the doore, But aid the infant, and releeue the poore. Else seeking mercy, being mercilesse, Thou be adiudged to endlesse heauinesse. Enters the Vsurer, a yoong Gentleman, and a poore man. Vsurer. Come on, I am euery day troubled with those needie companions, what newes with you, what wind brings you hither? Gent. Sir I hope how far soeuer you make it off, you remember too well for me, that this is the day wherein I should pay you money that I tooke vp of you alate in a commoditie. Poore man. And sir, sirreuerence of your manhood and genterie, I haue brought home such mony as you lent me. Vsurer. You yoong Gentleman, is my mony readie? Gentle. Trulie sir, this time was so short, the commoditie so bad, and the promise of friends so broken, that I could not prouide it against the day, wherefore I am come to intreat you to stand my friend, and to fauour me with a longer time, and I will make you sufficient consideration. Vsurer. Is the winde in that doore, if thou hast my mony so it is, I will not defer a day, an houre, a minute, but take the forfeyt of the bond. Gent. I pray you sir consider that my losse was great by the commoditie I tooke vp, you knowe sir I borrowed of you forty pounds, whereof I had ten pounds in money, and thirtie pounds in Lute strings, which when I came to sell againe, I could get but fiue pounds for them, so had I sir but fifteene pounds for my fortie: In consideration of this ill bargaine, I pray you sir giue me a month longer. Vsurer. I answered thee afore not a minute, what haue I to do how thy bargain prooued, I haue thy hand set to my book, that thou receiuedst fortie pounds of me in money. Gent. I sir it was your deuice that, to colour the Statute, but your conscience knowes what I had. Poore. Freend, thou speakest hebrew to him, when thou talkest to him of conscience, for he hath as much conscience about the forfeyt of an Obligation, as my blind Mare God blesse her, hath ouer a manger of Oates. Gent. Then there is no fauour sir? Vsurer. Come to morrow to mee, and see how I will vse thee. Gent. No couetous Caterpiller, know, that I haue made extreame shift rather then I would fall into the hands of such a rauening panthar: and therefore here is thy mony and deliuer me the recognisance of my lands. Vsurer. What a spite is this, hath sped of his Crownes, if he had mist but one halfe houre, what a goodly Farme had I gotten for fortie pounds, well tis my cursed fortune. Oh haue I no shift to make him forfeit his recognisance. Cent. Come sir will you dispatch and tell your mony? Strikes 4. a clocke. Vsurer. Stay, what is this a clocke foure, let me see, to be paid between the houres of three and foure in the afternoone, this goes right for me: you sir, heare you not the clocke, and haue you not a counterpaine of your Obligation? the houre is past, it was to bee paid betweene three and foure, and now the clocke hath strooken foure, I will receiue none, Ile stand to the forfeyt of the recognisance. Gent. Why sir, I hope you do but iest, why tis but foure, and will you for a minute take forfeyt of my bond? if it were so sir, I was here before foure. Vsurer. Why didst thou not tender thy mony then? if I offer thee iniuriet, ake the law of me, complaine to the iudge, I will receiue no mony. Poore. Well sir, I hope you will stand my good maister for my Cow, I borrowed thirtie shillings on her, and for that I haue paid you 18. pence a weeke, and for her meate you haue had her milke, and I tell you sir, she giues a pretie soape: now sir here is your mony. Vsurer. Hang beggerly knaue, commest to me for a Cow, did I not bind her bought and sold for a peny, and was not thy day to haue paid yestarday? thou getst no Cow at my hand. Poore. No cow sir, alasse that word no cow, goes as cold to my heart, as a draught of small drinke in a frostie morning. No cow sir, why alasse, alasse, M. Usurer, what shal become of me, my wife, and my poore childe? Vsurer. Thou getst no cow of me knaue, I cannot stand prating with you, I must be gone. Poore. Nay but heare you M. Usurer, no cow, why sir heres your thirtie shillings, I haue paid you 18. pence a weeke, &amp; therfore there is reason I should haue my cow. Vsurer. What pratest thou, haue I not answered thee thy day is broken? Poore. Why sir alasse, my Cow is a common-wealth to mee, for first sir, she allowes me, my wife and sonne, for to banket our selues withall, butter, cheese, whay, curds, creame, sod milke, raw-milke, sower-milke, sweete-milke, and butter-milk, besides sir, she saued me euery yeare a peny in almanakes, for shee was as good to me as a Prognostication, if she had but set vp her taile and haue galladt about the meade, my little boy was able to say, oh father there will be a storme: her very taile was a Kalender to me, &amp; now to loose my cow, alas M. Usurer, take pittie vpon mee. Vsurer. I haue other matters to talke on, farewell fellowes. Gent. Why but thou couetous churle, wilt thou not receiue thy mony and deliuer me my recognisance? Vsurer. Ile deliuer thee none, if I haue wronged thee, seeke thy mends at the law. Gent. And so I will insatiable pesant. Poore. And sir, rather then I will put vp this word no Cow, I will laie my wiues best gowne to pawne. I tell you sir, when the slaue vttered this word no Cow, it strooke to my heart, for my wife shal neuer haue one so fit for her turne againe, for indeed sir, she is a woman that hath her twidling strings broke. Gent. What meanest thou by that fellow? Poore. Marre sir, sirreuerence of your manhood, she breakes winde behinde, and indeed sir, when shee sat milking of her Cow and let a fart, my other Cowes would start at the noise, and kick downe the milke and away: but this Cow, sir the gentlest Cow, my wife might blow whilst she burst: and hauing such good conditions, shall the Usurer come vpon me with no cow? Nay sir, before I pocket vp this word no Cow, my wiues gowne goes to the Lawier, why alasse sir, tis as ill a word to me, as no Crowne to a King. Gent. Well fellow, go with me, and ile helpe thee to a Lawyer. Poore. Marrie and I will sir: No Cow, well the world goes hard. Exeunt. Oseas. Oseas. Where hatefull vsurie Is counted husbandrie, Where mercilesse men rob the poore, And the needie are thrust out of doore. Where gaine is held for conscience, And mens pleasures is all on pence, Where yoong Gentlemen forfeit their lands Through riot, into the Vsurers hands: Where pouertie is despised &amp; pittie banished And mercy indeed vtterly vanished. Where men esteeme more of mony then of God, Let that land looke to feele his wrathfull rod. For there is no sin more odious in his sight, Then where vsurie defraudes the poore of his right. London take heede, these sins abound in thee: The poore complaine, the widowes wronged bee. The Gentlemen by subtiltie are spoilde, The plough-men loose the crop for which they toild. Sin raignes in thee ô London euery houre, Repent and tempt not thus the heauenly power. Enters Remilia, with a traine of Ladies in all royaltie. Remilia. Faire Queene, yet handmaids vnto Rasnes loue, Tell me, is not my state so glorious As Iunoes pomp, when tyred with heauens despoyle, Clad in her vestments, spotted all with starres? She crost the siluer path vnto her Ioue, Is not Remilias far more beautious, Rich with the pride of natures excellencie? Then Venus in the brightest of her shine? My haires surpasse they not Apollos locks? Are not my Tresses curled with such art, As loue delights to hide him in their faire? Doth not mine eye shine like the morning lampe, That tels Aurera when her loue will come? Haue I not stolne the beautie of the heauens, And placest it on the feature of my face? Can any Goddesse make compare with me? Or match her with the faire Remilia? Aluida. The beauties that proud Paris saw from Troy, Mustering in Ida for the golden ball, Were not so gorgious as Remilia. Remilia. I haue trickt my tramels vp with riches balme, And made my perfumes of the purest Myrre: The precious drugs that Ægypts wealth affoords, The costly painting fetcht fro curious Tyre, Haue mended in my face what nature mist. Am I not the earths wonder in my lookes? Alui. The wonder of the earth and pride of heauen. Remilia. Looke Aluida a haire stands not amisse, For womens locks are tramels of conceit, Which do intangle loue for all his wiles. Aluid. Madam, vnlesse you coy it trick and trim, And plaie the ciuill wanton ere you yeeld, Smiting disdaine of pleasures with your tongue, Patting your princely Rasni on the cheeke, When he presumes to kisse without consent: You marre the market, beautie nought auailes. You must be proud, for pleasures hardly got, Are sweete, if once attainde. Remilia. Faire Aluida, Thy counsell makes Remilia passing wise. Suppose that thou weart Rasnes mightinesse, And I Remilia Prince of excellence. Aluida. I would be maister then of loue and thee. Remil. Of loue and me? Proud and disdainfull king, Dar'st thou presume to touch a Deitie, Before she grace thee with a yeelding smile? Aluida. Tut my Remilia, be not thou so coy, Say nay, and take it. Remilia. Carelesse and vnkinde, Talkes Rasni to Remilia in such sort As if he did enioy a humane forme? Looke on thy Loue, behold mine eies diuine, And dar'st thou twit me with a womans fault? Ah Rasni thou art rash to iudge of me, I tell thee Flora oft hath wooed my lips, To lend a rose to beautifie her spring, The sea-Nymphs fetch their lillies from my cheekes. Then thou vnkind, and hereon would I weepe. Alui. And here would Aluida resigne her charge, For were I but in thought Th'assirian King, I needs must quite thy teares, with kisses sweete, And craue a pardon with a friendly touch, You know it Madam though I teach it not, The touch I meane, you smile when as you think il. Remi. How am I pleas'd to hear thy pritty prate, According to the humor of my minde? Ah Nymphs, who fairer then Remilia? The gentle windes haue woode me with their sighes, The frowning aire hath cleerde when I did smile, And when I tract vpon the grasse, Loue that makes warme the center of the earth, Lift vp his crest to kisse Remilas foote, Iuno still entertaines her amorous Ioue‘ With new delights, for feare he looke on me, The Phwnix feathers are become my Fanne, For I am beauties Phœnix in this world. Shut close these Curtaines stright and shadow me, For feare Apollo spie me in his walkes, And scorne all eyes, to see Remilias eyes. Nymphes, Knancks, sing for Mauors draweth nigh, Hide me in Closure, let him long to looke, For were a Goddesse fairer then am I, Ile scale the heauens to pull her from the place. They draw the Curtaines, and Musicke plaies. Aluida. Beleeue me, tho she say that she is fairest, I thinke my pennie siluer bo her leaue. Enter Rasni with his Lords in pomp, who make a ward about him, with him the Magi in great pomp. Rasni. Magi for loue of Rasni by our Art, By Magicke frame an Armour out of hand, For faire Remilia to disport her in. Meane-while, I will bethinke me on surth, a pomp. Exit. The Magi with their rods beate the ground, and from vnder the same riseth a braue Arbour, the King returneth in an other sute while the Trumpets sounde. Rasni. Blest be ye man of Art that grace me thus, And blessed be this day where Himen hies, To ioyne in vnion pride of heauen and earth. Lightning and thunder wherewith Remelia is strooken. What wondrous threatning noise is this I heare? What flashing lightnings trouble our delights? When I draw neare Remilias royall Tent, I waking, dreame of sorrow or mishap. Rada. Dread not O King, at ordinary chance, These are but common exalitations, Drawne from the earth, in substance hot and drie, Or moist and thicke, or Meteors combust, Matters and causes incident to time, In kindling in the firie region first. Tut, be not now a Romane Angurer, Approach the Tent, looke on Remelia. Rasni. Thou hast confirmd my doubts kinde Radagon. Now ope ye folds where Queene of fauour sits Carrying a Net within her curled locks, Wherein the Graces are intangled oft: Ope like th'imperiall gates where Phœbus sits, When as he meanes to wooe his Clitia. Necternall cares, ye blemishers of blisse, Cloud not mine eyes whilst I behold her face, Remilia my delight, she answereth not. He drawes the Curtaines and findes her strooken with Thunder, blacke. How pale? as if bereau'd in fatall meedes, The balmy breath hath left her bosome quite. My Hesperus by cloudie death is bent, Uillaines away, fetch Sirrops of the Inde, Fetch Balsomo the kind preserue of life, Fetch wine of Greece, fetch oiles, fetch herbes, fetch all To fetch her life, or I will faint and die. They bring in all these and offer, nought preuailes. Herbes, Oyles of Inde, alasse there nought preuailes. Shut are the day-bright eyes, that made me see, Lockt are the Iems of ioy in dens of death, Yet triumph I on fate, and he on her. Malicious mistresse of inconstancie, Damd be thy name, that hath obscur'd my ioy, Kings, Uiceroy, Princes, reare a royall tombe For my Remelia, beare her from my sight, Whilst I in teares, weepe for Remilia. They beare her out. Rada. What maketh Rasni moodie? Losse of one? As if no more were left so faire as she? Behold a daintie minion for the nonce, Faire Aluida the Paphlagonian Queene, Wooe her, and leaue this weeping for the dead. Ras. What wooe my subiects wife that honoureth me? Rada. Tut, Kings this meum tuum should not know. Is she not faire? Is not her husband hence? Hold, take her at the hands of Radagon. A pretie peate to driue your mourne away. Rasni. She smiles on me, I see she is mine owne. Wilt thou be Rasnes royall Paramour? Rad. She blushing yeelds consent, make no dispute? The King is sad, and must be gladded straight. Let Paphlagonian King go mourne meane-while. He thrust the King out, and so they Exeunt. Oseas. Pride hath his iudgement, London looke about, Tis not inough in shew to be deuout: A furie now from heauen to lands vnknowne, Hath made the Prophet speake, not to his owne. Flie wanton flie, this pride and vaine attire, The seales to set your tender hearts on fire. Be faithfull in the promise you haue past, Else God will plague and punish at the last. When lust is hid in shroude of wretched life, When craft doth dwell in bed of married wife. Marke but the Prophets, we that shortly shewes, After death expect for many woes. Enters the poore man and the Gntleman, with their Lawier. Gent. I need not sir discourse vnto you, the dutie of Lawiers in tendering the right cause of their Clients, nor the conscience you are tied vnto by higher command. Therefore suffise the Usurer hath done me wrong, you know the case: and good sir, I haue strained my selfe to giue you your fees. Lawier. Sir if I should any way neglect so manifest a truth, I were to be accused of open periury, for the case is euident. Poore. And trulie sir, for my case, if you helpe me not for my matter, why sir, I and my wife are quity vndone, I want my mease of milke when I goe to my worke, and my boy his bread and butter when he goes to schoole. M. Lawier pitie me, for surely sir, I was faine to lay my wiues best gowne to pawne for your fees, when I lookt vpon it sir, and saw how hansomly it was dawbed with statute lace, and what a faire mockado Cape it had, and then thought how hansomely it became my wife, truly sir my heart is made of butter, it melts at the least persecution, I fell on weeping, but when I thought on the words the Usurer gaue me, no Cow: then sir, I would haue stript her into her smocke, but I would make him deliuer my Cow ere I had done, therefore good M. Lawier stand my friend. Lawier. Trust me father, I will doo for thee as much as for my selfe. Poore. Are you married sir? Lawier. I marry am I father. Poore. Then goods Benison light on you &amp; your good wife, and send her that she be neuer troubled with my wiues disease. Lawier. Why whats thy wiues disease? Poore. Trulie sir, she hath two open faults, and one priuie fault, sir the first is, she is too eloqu?t for a poore man, and hath he words of Art, for she will call me Rascall, Rogue, Runnagate, Uarlet, Uagabound, Slaue, and Knaue. Why alasse sir, &amp; these be but holi-day tearmes, but if you heard her working-day words, in faith sir, they be ratlers like thunder sir, for after the dewe followes a storme, for then am I sure either to bee well buffetted, my face scratcht, or my head broken, and therefore good M. Lawyer, on my knees I aske it, let me not go home again to my wife, with this word, No Cow: for then shee will exercise her two faults vpon me with all extremitie. Lawier. Feare not man, but what is thy wiues priuy fault? Poore. Truly sir, thats a thing of nothing, alasse she indeede ssrreuerence of your maistership, doth vse to breake winde in her sleepe. Oh sir, here comes the iudge, and the old Catife the Usurer Enters the Iudge, the Vsurer, and his attendants. Vsurer. Sir here is fortie Angels for you, and if at any time you want a hundreth pound or two, tis readie at your command, or the feeding of three or foure fat bullocks: whereas these needie slaues can reward with nothing but a cap and a knee, &amp; therefore I pray you sir fauour my case. Iudge. Feare not sir, Ile do what I can for you. Vsurer. What maister Lawier, what make you here, mine aduersary for these Clients? Lawier. So it chanceth now sir. Vsurer. I know you know the old Prouerbe, He is not wise, that is not wise for himselfe. I would not be disgracst in this action, therefore here is twentie angels say nothing in the matter, and what you say, say to no purpose, for the Iudge is my friend. Lawier. Let me alone, Ile fit your purpose. Iudge. Come, where are these fellowes that are the plaintifes, what can they say against this honest Citizen our neighbour, a man of good report amongst all men? Poore. Trulie M. Iudge, he is a man much spoken off, marry euery mans cries are against him, and especially we, and therefore I thinke we haue brought our Lawier to touch him with as much law as will fetch his lands and my Cowe, with a pestilence. Gent. Sir, I am the other plaintife, and this is my councellour, I beseech your honour be fauourable to me in equitie. Iudge. Oh Signor Mizaldo, what can you say in this Gentlemans behalfe? Lawier. Faith sir as yet little good, sir tell you your owne case to the iudge, for I haue so many matters in my head, that I haue almost forgotten it. Gent. Is the winde in that doore? why then my Lord thus: I tooke vp of this cursed Usurer, for so I may well tearme him, a commoditie of fortie poundes, whereof I receiued ten pound in mony, and thirtie pound in lute-strings, wherof I could by great friendship make but fiue pounds: for the assurance of this badde commodity, I bound him my land in recognisance, I came at my day and tendred him his mony and he would not take it, for the redresse of my open wrong, I craue but iustice. Iudge. What say you to this sir? Vsurer. That first, he had no Lute-strings of me, for looke you sir, I haue his owne hand to my booke for y e receit of fortie pound. Gent. That was sir, but a deuise of him to colour the Statute. Iudge. Well he hath thine owne hand, and we can craue no more in law: but now sir, he saies his mony was tendred at the day and houre. Vsurer. This is manifest contrary sir, and on that I will depose, for here is the obligation, to be paid between three and foure in the after noone, and the Clocke strooke foure before he offered it, and the words be betweene three and foure, therefore to be tendred before foure. Gent. Sir, I was there before foure, &amp; he held me with brabling till the Clocke strooke, and then for the breach of a minute he refused my money, and keepe the recognisance of my land for so small a trifle: Good Signor Mizaldo speak what is law, you haue your fee, you haue heard what the case is, and therefore do me iustice and right: I am a yoong Gentleman, and speake for my patrimony. Lawier. Faith sir, the Case is altered, you told me it before in an other maner, the law goes quite against you, and therfore you must plead to the iudge for fauour. Gent. O execrable briberye. Poore. Faith sir Iudge, I pray you let me be the Gentlemans Counsellour, for I can say thus much in his defence, that the Usurers Clocke is the swiftest Clocke in all the Towne, tis sir like a womans tongue, it goes euer halfe an houre before the time: for when we were gone from him, other Clocks in the Towne strooke foure. Iudge. Hold thy prating fellow, and you yoong gentleman, this is my ward, looke better an other time both to your bargains and to the paiments, for I must giue flat sentence against you: that for default of tendering the mony betweene the houres, you haue forfeited your recognisance, and he to haue the land. Gent. O inspeakeable iniustice. Poore. O monstrous, miserable, moth-eaten Iudge. Iudge. Now you fellow, what haue you to say for your matter? Poore. Maister Lawier, I laide my wiues gowne to pawne for your fees, I pray you to this geere. Lawier. Alasse poore man, thy matter is out of my head, and therefore I pray thee tell it thy selfe. Poore. I hold my Cap to a noble, that the Usurer hath giuen him some gold, and he chewing it in his mouth, hath got y e toothache that he cannot speake. Iudge. Well sirrha, I must be short, and therefore say on. Poore. M. maister Iudge, I borrowed of this man thirtie shillings for which, I left him in pawne my good Cow, the bargaine was, he should haue eighteen pence a weeke, and the Cowes milk for vsurie: Now sir, assoone as I had gotten the mony, I brought it him, and broke but a day, and for that he refused his mony, and keepes my Cowe sir. Iudge. Why thou hast giuen sentence against thy selfe, for in breaking thy day, thou hast lost thy Cowe. Poore. Maister Lawier, now for my ten shillings. Lawier. Faith poore man, thy Case is so bad, I shall but speake against thee. Poore. Twere good then I shuld haue my ten shillings again. Lawier. Tis my fee fellow for comming, wouldst thou haue me come for nothing? Poore. Why then am I like to goe home, not onely with no Cowe, but no gowne: this geare goes hard. Iudge. Well you haue heard what fauour I can shew you, I must do iustice, come M. Mizaldo, and you sir, go home with me to dinner. Poore. Why but M. Iudge, no cow, &amp; M. Lawier no gowne, Then must I cleane run out of the Towne. How cheere you gentleman, you crie no lands too, the Iudge hath made you a knight for a gentleman, hath dubd you sir Iohn lackland. Gent. O miserable time wherein gold is aboue God. Poore. Feare not man, I haue yet a fetch to get thy lands and my cow againe, for I haue a sonne in the Court, that is eyther a King or a Kings fellow, and to him wil I go and complain on the Iudge and the Usurer both. Gent. And I will go with thee and intreat him for my Case. Poore. But how shall I go home to my wife, when I shall haue nothing to say vnto her, but no Cow. Alasse sir, my wiues faults will fall vpon me. Gent. Feare not, lets go, Ile quiet her shalt see. Exeunt. Oseas. Flie Iudges flie, corruption in your Court, The Iudge of truth, hath made your iudgement short. Looke so to iudge, that at the latter day, Ye be not iudg'd with those that wend astray. Who passeth iudgement for his priuate gaine, He well may iudge, he is adiudg'd to paine. Enters the Clowne and all his crew drunke. Clowne. Farewell gentle Tapster, maisters, as good ale as euer was tapt, looke to your feete, for the ale is strong: well farewell gentle Tapster. 1. Ruffian. Why sirrha slaue, by heauens maker, thinkest thou the wench loues thee best, because she laught on thee, giue me but such an other word, and I will throw the pot at thy head. Clowne. Spill no drinke, spill no drinke, the Ale is good, Ile tell you what, ale is ale, and so Ile commend me to you with hartie commendations: farewell gentle Tapster. 2. Why wherfore pesant scornst thou that the wench should loue me, looke but on her, and ile thrust my dagger in thy bosome 1. Ruffian. Well sirrha well, thart as thart, and so ile take thee. 2. Why what am I? 1. Why what thou wilt, a flaue. 2. Then take that villaine, and learne how to vse me another time. 1. Oh I am slaine. 2. Thats al one to me, I care not, now wil I in to my wench and call for a fresh pot. Clowne. Nay but heare ye, take me with ye, for the ale is ale, cut a fresh toast Tapster, fil me a pot here is mony, I am no beggar, Ile follow thee as long as the ale lasts: a pestilence on the blocks for me, for I might haue had a fall: well if we shal haue no Ale ile sit me downe, and so farewell gentle Tapster. Here he fals ouer the dead man. Enters the King, Aluida, the King of Cilicia, and of Paphlagonia, with other attendant. Rasni. What slaughtred wretch lies bleeding here his last? So neare the royall pallace of the King, Search out if any one be biding nie, That can discourse the manner of his death, Seate thee faire Aluida, the faire of faires, Let not the otrict once offend thine eyes, L. Heres one sits here a sleepe my Lord. Rasni. Wake him, and make enquirie of this thing. Lord. Sirrha you, hearest thou fellow? Clowne. If you will fill a fresh pot, here's a penny, or else farewell gentle Tapster. Lord. He is drunke my Lord. Rasni. Weele sport with him, that Aluida may laugh. L. Sirrha thou fellow, thou must come to the King. Clowne. I will not do a stroake of worke to day, for the ale is good ale, and you can aske but a peny for a pot, no more by the statute. L. Uillaine, heres the King, thou must come to him. Clowne. The King come to an Ale-house? Tapster, fil me three pots, wheres the King, is this he? Giue me your hand sir, as good Ale as euer was tapt, you shall drinke while your skin cracke. Rasni. But hearest thou fellow, who kild this man? Clowne. Ile tell you sir, if you did taste of the Ale, all Niniuie hath not such a cup of Ale, it floures in the cup sir, by my troth I spent eleuen pence beside three rases of ginger. Rasni. Answer me knaue to my question, how came this man slaine? Clowne. Slain, why ale is strong ale, tis hufcap, I warrant you twill make a man well. Tapster ho, for the King a cup of ale and a fresh Toast, heres two rases more. Aluida. Why good fellow the King talkes not of drinke, he would haue thee tell him how this man came dead. Clowne. Dead nay, I thinke I am aliue yet, and will drinke a full pot ere night, but here ye, if ye be the wench that fild vs drink, why so: do your office, and giue vs a fresh pot, or if you be the tapsters wife, why so, wash the glasse cleane. Aluida. Hee is so drunke my Lord, there is no talking with him. Clowne. Drunke, nay then wench I am not drunke, thart a shitten queane, to call me drunke, I tell thee I am not drunke, I am a smith. Enters the Smith, the Clownes maister. Lord. Sir, here comes one perhaps that can tell. Smith. God saue you maister. Rasni. Smith canst thou tell me how this man came dead? Smith. May it please your highnesse, my man here and a crue of them went to the ale-house, and came out so drunke, that one of them kild another: and now sir, I am faine to leaue my shop, and come to fetch him home. Rasni. Some of you carrie away the dead body, drunken men must haue their fits, and sirrha Smith, hence with thy man. Smith. Sirrha you, rise come go wth me. Clowne. If we shall haue a pot of Ale, lets haue it, heres mony: hold Tapster take my purse. Smith. Come then with me, the pot stands full in the house. Clowne. I am for you, lets go, thart an honest Tapster, weele drinke six pots ere we part. Exeunt. Rasni. Beautious, more bright then beautie in mine eyes, Tell me faire sweeting, wants thou any thing? Conteind within the threefold circle of the world, That may make Aluida liue full content. Aluida. Nothing my Lord, for all my thoughts are pleasde, When as mine eye surfets with Rasnes sight. Enters the King of Paphlagonia, male-content. Rasni. Looke how thy husband haunts our royall Courts, How still his sight breeds melancholy stormes, Oh Aluida, I am passing passionate, And vext with wrath and anger to the death: Mars when he held faire Venus on his knee, And saw the limping Smith come from his forge, Had not more deeper sorrowes in his brow, Then Rasni hath to see this Paphlagon. Alui. Content thee sweet, ile salue thy sorrow straight, Rest but the ease of all thy thoughts on me, And if I make not Rasni blyth againe, Then say that womens fancies haue no shifts. Paphla. Shamst thou not Rasni though thou beest a King, To shroude adultry in thy royall seate, Art thou arch-ruler of great Niniuie, Who shouldst excell in vertue as in state, And wrongst thy friend by keeping backe his wife, Haue I not battaild in thy troups full oft, Gainst Ægypt, Iury, and proud Babylon, Spending my bloud to purchase thy renowme, And is the guerdon of my chiualrie, Ended in this abusing of my wife? Restore her me, or I will from thy Courts, And make discourse of thy adulterous deeds. Ras. Why take her Paphlagon, exclaime not man, For I do prise mine honour more then loue. Faire Aluida go with thy husband home. Alui. How dare I go, sham'd with so deepe misdeed, Reuenge will broile within my husbands brest, And when he hath me in the Court at home, Then Aluida shall feele reuenge for all. Rasni. What saist thou King of Paphlagon to this? Thou hearest the doubt thy wife doth stand vpon, If she haue done amisse it is my fault, I prithie pardon and forget all. Paphla. If that I meant not Rasni to forgiue, And quite forget the follies that are past, I would not vouchsafe her presence in my Courts, But she shall be my Queene, my loue, my life, And Aluida vnto her Paphlagon And loued, and more beloued then before. Rasni. What sayst thou Aluida to this? Alui. That will he sweare it to my Lord the king, And in a full carouse of Greekish wine, Drinke downe the malice of his deepe reuenge, I will go home and loue him new againe. Rasni. What answeres Paphlagon? Paphla. That what she hath requested I will do. Alui. Go Damosell fetch me that sweet wine, That stands within thy Closet on the shelfe, Powre it into a standing bowle of gold, But on thy life taste not before the King. Make hast, why is great Rasni melancholy thus? If promise be not kept, hate all for me. Here is the wine my Lord, first make him sweare. Paphla. By Niniuies great gods, and Niniuies great king. My thoughts shall neuer be to wrong my wife, And thereon heres a full carowse to her. Alui. And thereon Rasni heres a kisse for thee, Now maist thou freely fold thine Aluida. Paphla. Oh I am dead, obstructions of my breath, The poison is of wondrous sharpe effect, Cursed be all adultrous queenes say I, And cursing so, poore Paphlagon doth die. Alui. Now haue I not salued the sorrows of my lord? Haue I not rid ariuall of thy loues, What saist thou Rasni to thy Paramour? Rasni. That for this deed ile deck my Aluida, In Sendall and in costly Sussapine, Bordred with Pearle and India Diamond, Ile cause great Eol perfume all his windes, With richest myrre and curious Amber greece, Come louely minion, paragon for faire, Come follow me sweet goddesse of mine eye, And taste the pleasures Rasni will prouide. Exeunt. Oseas. Where whordome raines, there murther follows fast, As falling leaues before the winter blast, A wicked life, trainde vp in endlesse crime, Hath no reward vnto the latter time. When Letchers shall be punisht for their lust, When Princes plagued, because they are vniust Foresee in time, the warning bell doth towle, Subdue the flesh, by praier to saue the soule. London behold the cause of others wreacke, And set the sword of iustice at thy backe. Deferre not off, to morrow is too late, By night he comes perhaps to iudge thy state. Enter Ionas Solus. Ionas. From forth the depth of my imprisoned soule, Steale you my sighes, testifie my paine, Conuey on wings of mine immortall tone, My zealous praiers, vnto the starrie throne: Ah mercifull and iust, thou dreadfull God, Where is thine arme to lay reuengefull stroakes Upon the heads of our rebellious race? Loe Israell once that flourisht like the vine, Is barraine laide, the beautifull increase Is wholely blent, and irreligious zeale Incampeth there where vertue was inthroan'd, Ah-lasse the while, the widow wants reliefe, The fatherlesse is wronged by naked need, Deuotion sleepes in sinders of contempt, Hypocrisie infects the holy Priest. Aye me for this, woe me for these misdeeds, Alone I walke to thinke vpon the world, And sigh to see thy Prophets so contemn'd: Ah-lasse contemn'd by cursed Israell. Yet Ionas rest content, tis Israels sinne That causeth this, then muse no more thereon, But pray amends, and mend thy owne amisse. An Angell appeareth to Ionas. Angel. Amithais sonne, I charge thee muse no more, (I am) hath power to pardon and correct, To thee pertains to do the Lords command. Go girt thy loines, and hast thee quickly hence, To Niniuie, that mightie Citie wend, And say this message from the Lord of hoasts, Preach vnto them these tidings from thy God. Behold thy wickednesse hath tempted me, And pierced through the ninefold orbes of heauen: Repent, or else thy iudgement is at hand. This said, the Angell vanisheth. Ionas. Prostrate I lye before the Lord of hostes, UUith humble eares intending his behest, Ah honoured be Iehouahs great command, Then Ionas must to Niniuie repaire, Commanded as the Prophet of the Lord, Great dangers on this iourney to awaight, But dangers none where heauens direct the course, UUhat should I deeme, I see, yea sighing see, How Israell sinne, yet knowes the way of truth, And thereby growes the the by-word of the world, How then should God in iudgement be so strickt? Gainst those who neuer heard or knew his power, To threaten vtter ruine of them all: Should I report this iudgement of my God, I should incite them more to follow sinne, And publish to the world my countries blame, It may not be, my conscience tels me no. Ah Ionas wilt thou prooue rebellious then? Consider ere thou fall, what errour is, My minde misgiues, to Ioppa will I flee, And for a while to Tharsus shape my course, Untill the Lord vnfret his angry browes. Enter certaine merchants of Tharsus, a Maister, and some Sailers M. Come on braue merchants, now the wind doth serue, And sweetly blowes a gale at UUest, Southwest. Our yards a crosse, our anchors on the pike, UUhat shall we hence and take this merry gale? Mer. Sailers conuey our budgets strait aboord, And we will recompence your paines at last, If once in safetie we may Tharsus see, M. weele feast these merry mates and thee. M. Mean-while content your selues with silly cates, Our beds are boordes, our feasts are full of mirth. We vse no pompe, we are the Lords of see, When Princes swet in care, we swincke of glee. Orious shoulders and the pointers serue, To be our Load-stars in the lingring night, The beauties of Arcturus we behold, And though the Sailer is no booke-man held, He knowes more Art then euer booke-men read. Sailer. By heauens well said, in honor of our trade, Lets see the proudest scholler stir his course Or shift his tides as Silly sailers do. Then will we yeeld them praise, else neuer none. Mer. Well spoken fellow in thine owne behalfe, But let vs hence, wind tarries none you wot, And tide and time let slip is hardly got. M. March to the Hauen marchants, I follow you. Ionas. Now doth occasion further my desires, I finde companions fit to aid my flight, Staie sir I pray, and heare a word or two. M. Say on good freend, but briefly if you please, My passengers by this time are aboord. Ionas. Whither pretend you to imbarke your selues? M. To Tharsus sir, and here in Ioppa hauen Our ship is prest and readie to depart. Ionas. May I haue passage for my mony then? M. What not for mony? pay ten siluerlings, You are a welcome guest if so you please. Ionas. Hold take thine hire, I follow thee my friend. M. Where is your budget let me bare it sir. Ionas. To one in peace, who saile as I do now, Put trust in him, who succoureth euery want. Exeunt. Ose. When Prophets new inspird, presume to force And tie the power of heauen to their conceits, When feare, promotion, pride, or simony, Ambition, subtill craft, their thoughts disguise, Woe to the flocke whereas the shepheards fold, For lo the Lord at vnawares shall plague The carelesse guide, because his flocks do stray: The axe already to the tree is set, Beware to tempt the Lord ye men of art. Enters Alcon, Thrasibulus, Samia, Clesiphon a lad. Clesi. Mother, some meat or else I die for want. Samia. Ah little boy how glad thy mother would Supply thy wants, but naked need denies: Thy fathers slender portion in this world, By vsury and false deceit is lost, No charitie within this Citie bides: All for themselues, and none to helpe the poore. Clesi. Father, shall Clesiphon haue no reliefe? Alcon. Faith my boy, I must be flat with thee, we must feed vpon prouerbes now. As necessitie hath no law, a churles feast is better then none at all: for other remedies haue we none, except thy brother Radagon helpe vs. Samia. Is this thy slender care to helpe our childe? Hath nature armde thee to no more remorse? Ah cruell man vnkinde and pittilesse: Come Clesiphon my boy, ile beg for thee. Clesi. Oh how my mothers mourning moueth me. Alcon. Nay you shal pay me interest for getting the boy (wife) before you carrie him hence. Ah-lasse woman what can Alcon do more? Ile pluck the belly out of my heart for thee sweet Samia, be not so waspish. Samia. Ah silly man, I know thy want is great, And foolishly I do craue where nothing is. Haste Alcon haste, make haste vnto our sonne, Who since he is in fauour of the King, May helpe this haplesse Gentleman and vs. For to regaine our goods from tyrants hands. Thra. Haue patience Samia, waight your weale from heauen, The Gods haue raisd your sonne I hope for this, To succour innocents in their distresse Enters Radagon, Solus. Lo where he comes from the imperiall Court, Go, lets prostrate vs before his feete. Alcon. Nay by my troth, ile neuer aske my sonne blessing, che trow, cha taught him his lesson to know his father, what sonne Radagon,, yfaith boy how doest thee? Rada. Uillaine disturbe me not, I cannot stay. Alcon. Tut sonne ile helpe you of that disease quickly, for I can hold thee, ask thy mother knaue, what cunning I haue to ease a woman, when a qualme of kindnesse come too neare her stomacke? Let me but claspe mine armes about her body and saie my praiers in her bosome, and she shall be healed presently, Rada. Traitor vnto my Princely Maiestie, How dar'st thou lay thy hands vpon a king? Samia. No Traitor Radagon, but true is he, What hath promotion bleared thus thine eye, To scorne thy father when he visits thee? Ah-lasse my sonne behold with ruthfull eyes, Thy parents robd of all their worldly weale, By subtile meanes of Usurie and guile, The Iudges eares are deaffe and shut vp close, All mercie sleepes, then be thou in these plunges A patron to thy mother to her paines, Behold thy brother almost dead for foode, Oh succour vs, that first did succour thee. Rada. What succour me, fals callet hence auant? Old dotard pack, moue not my patience, I know you not, Kings neuer looke so low. Samia. You know vs not. Oh Rada. you know, That knowing vs, you know your parents then, Thou knowst this wombe first brought thee forth to light, I know these paps did foster thee my sonne. Alcon. And I know he hath had many a peece of bread &amp; cheese at my hands, as proud as he is, that know I. Thracib. I waight no hope of succours in this place, Where children hold their fathers in disgrace. Rada. Dare you enforce the furrowes of reuenge, Within the browes of royall Radagon? Uillaine auant, hence beggees with your brats, Marshall, why whip ye you not these rogues away? That thus disturbe our royall Maiestie. Clesiphon. Mother I see it is a wondrous thing, From base estate for to become a King: For why mee think my brother in these fits, Hath got a kingdome, and hath lost his wits. Rada. Yet more contempt before my roialtie? Slaues fetch out tortures worse then Titius plagues, And teare their toongs from their blasphemous heads. Thrasi. Ile get me gone, tho woe begon with griefe, No hope remaines, come Alcon let vs wend. Ra. Twer best you did, for feare you catch your bane. Samia. Nay Traitor, I will haunt thee to the death, Ungratious sonne, vntoward and peruerse, Ile fill the heauens with ecchoes of thy pride, And ring in euery eare thy small regard, That doest despise thy parents in their wants, And breathing forth my soule before thy feete, My curses still shall haunt thy hatefull head, And being dead, my ghost shall thee pursue. Enter Rasni King of Assiria, attended on by his sooth-sayers and Kings. Rasni. How now, what meane these outcries in our Court? Where nought should sound, but harmonies of heauen, UUhat maketh Radagon so passionate? Samia. Iustice, O King, iustice against my sonne. Rasni. Thy sonne: what sonne? Samia. This cursed Radagon. Rada. Dread Monarch, this is but a lunacie, UUhich griefe and want hath brought the woman to, UUhat doth this passion hold you euery Moone? Samia. Oh polliticke in sinne and wickednesse, Too impudent for to delude thy Prince. Oh Rasni, this same wombe brought him foorth, This is his father, worne with care and age, This is his brother, poore vnhappie lad, And I his mother, though contem'd by him, With tedious toyle we got our little good, And brought him vp to schoole with mickle charge: Lord how we ioy'd to see his towardnesse, And to our selues, we oft in silence said, This youth when we are old may succour vs. But now preferd and lifted vp by thee, We quite destroyed by cursed vsurie, He scorneth me, his father, and this childe. Clesi. He plaies the Serpent right, describ'd in Æsopes tale, That soughtt the fosters death, that lately gaue him life. Alcon. Nay and please your maiesti-ship, for proofe he was my childe, search the parish booke: the Clarke will sweare it, his godfathers and godmothers can witnesse it, it cost me fortie pence in ale and cakes on the wiues at his christning. Hence proud King, thou shalt neuer more haue my blessing. He takes him apart. Rasni. Say sooth in secret Radagon, Is this thy father? Rada. Mightie King he is, I blushing, tell it to your Maiestie. Ras. Why dost thou then contemne him and his friends? Rada. Because he is a base and abiect swaine, My mother and her brat both beggarly, Unmeete to be allied vnto a King, Should I that looke on Rasnes countenance, And march amidst his royall equipage, Embase my selfe to speake to such as they? Twere impious so to impaire the loue That mightie Rasni beares to Radagon. I would your grace would quit them from your sight, That dare presume to looke on Ioues compare. Rasni. I like thy pride, I praise thy pollicie, Such should they be that wait vpon my Court. Let me alone to answere (Radagon.) Uillaine seditious traitors as you be, That scandalize the honour of a King, Depart my Court, you stales of impudence, Unlesse you would be parted from your limmes, So base for to intitle father-hood, To Rasnes freend, to Rasnes fauourite? Rada. Hence begging scold, hence catiue clogd with yeares, On paine of death reuisit not the Court. Was I conceiu'd by such a scuruie trull, Or brought to light by such a lump of dirt: Go Lossell trot it to the cart and spade, Thou art vnmeete to looke vpon a King, Much lesse to be the father of a King. Alcon. You may see wife, what a goodly peece of worke you haue made, haue I tought you Arsmetry, as additiori multiplicarum, the rule of three, and all for the begetting of a boy, and to be banished for my labour. O pittiful hearing. Come Clesiphon follow me. Clesi. Brother beware, I oft haue heard it told, That sonnes who do their fathers scorne, shall beg when they be old. Exit Alcon, Clesiphon. Radagon. Hence bastard boy for feare you taste the whip. Samia. Oh all you heauens, and you eternall powers, That sway the sword of iustice in your hands, (If mothers curses of her sonnes contempt, May fill the ballance of your furie full) Powre downe the tempest of your direfull plagues, Upon the head of cursed Radagon. Vpon this praier she departeth, and a flame of fire appeareth from beneath, and Radagon is swallowed. So you are iust, now triumph Samia. Ext. Samia. Rasni. UUhat exporcising charme, or hatefull hag, Hath rauished the pride of my delight? UUhat tortuous planets, or maleuolent Conspiring power, repining destenie Hath made the concaue of the earth vnclose, And shut in ruptures louely Radagon? If I be Lord-commander of the cloudes, King of the earth, and Soueraigne of the seas, UUhat daring Saturne from his fierie denne, Doth dart these furious flames amidst my Court? I am not chiefe, there is more great then I, UUhat greater then Th'assirian Satrapos? It may not be, and yet I feare there is, That hath bereft me of my Radagon. Soothsaier. Monarch and Potentate of all our Prouinces, Muse not so much vpon this accident, UUhich is indeed nothing miraculous, The hill of Scicely, dread Soueraigne, Sometime on sodaine, doth euacuate, UUhole flakes of fire, and spues out from below The smoakie brands that Vulueus bellowes driue, UUhether by windes inclosed in the earth, Or fracture of the earth by riuers force, Such chances as was this, are often seene, UUhole cities suncke, whole countries drowned quite, Then muse not at the losse of Radagon. But frolicke with the dalliance of your loue. Let cloathes of purple set with studdes of gold, Embellished with all the pride of earth, Be spred for Aluida to sit vpon. Then thou like Mars courting the Queene of loue, Maist driue away this melancholy fit. Rasni. The proofe is good, and philosophicall, And more, thy counsaile plausible and sweete. Come Lords, though Rasni wants his Radagon, Earth will repaie him many Radagons, And Aluida with pleasant lookes reuiue, The heart that droupes for want of Radagon. Exeunt. Oseas. When disobedience raigneth in the childe, And Princes eares by flattery be beguilde. When lawes do passe by fauour, not by truth, When falshood swarmeth both in old and youth. When gold is made a god to wrong the poore, And charitie exilde from rich mens doore. When men by wit, do labour to disproue, The plagues for sinne, sent downe by God aboue. Where great mens eares are stopt to good aduice. And apt to heare those tales that feed their vice. Woe to the land, for from the East shall rise, A lambe of peace, the scourge of vanities. The iudge of truth, the patron of the iust, Who soone will lay presumption in the dust. And giue the humble poore their hearts desire And doome the worldlings to eternall fire. Repent all you that heare, for feare of plagues, O London, this and more doth swarme in thee, Repent, repent, for why the Lord doth see. With tremblnig pray, and mend what is amisse, The swoord of iustice drawne alreadie is. Eenter the Clowne and the Smiths wife. Clowne. Why but heare you mistresse, you know a womans eies are like a paire of pattens, fit to saue shoo-leather in summer, and to keepe away the cold in winter, so you may like your husband with the one eye, because you are married, and me with the other, because I am your man. Alasse, alasse, think mistresse what a thing loue is, why it is like to an ostry faggot, that once set on fire, is as hardly quenched, as the bird Crocodill driuen out of her neast. Wife. Why Adam, cannot a woman wink but she must sleep, and can she not loue, but she must crie it out at the Crosse? know Adam, I loue thee as my selfe, now that we are togeither in secret. Clown. Mis. these words of yours, are like a Fox taile, placed in a gentlewomans Fanne, which as it is light, so it giueth life. Oh these words are as sweete as a lilly, whereupon offering a borachio of kisses to your vnseemely personage, I entertain you vpon further acquaintance. Wife. Alasse my husband comes. Clowne. Strike vp the drum, and say no words but mum. Smith. Sirrha you, and you huswife, well taken togither, I haue long suspected you, and now I am glad I haue found you togither. Clowne. Truly sir, and I am glad that I may do you any way pleasure, either in helping you or my mistresse. Smith. Boy here, and knaue you shall know it straight, I will haue you both before the Magistrate, and there haue you surely punished. Clowne. Why then maister you are iealous? Smith. Iealous knaue, how can I be but iealous, to see you euer so familiar togither? thou art not only content to drink away my goods but to abuse my wife. Clowne. Two good qualities, drunkennesse and leachery, but maister are you iealous? Smith. I knaue, and thou shalt know it ere I passe, for I will beswindge thee while this roape will hold. Wife. My good husband abuse him not for he neuer proffered you any wrong, Smith. Nay whore, thy part shall not be behinde. Clowne. Why suppose maister I haue offended you, it is lawfull for the maister to beate the seruant for all offences? Smith. I marry is it knaue. Clowne. Then maister wil I prooue by lodgick, that seeing all sinnes are to receiue correction, the maister is to bee corrected of the man, and sir I pray you, what greater sinne is, then iealousie? tis like a mad dog that for anger bites himselfe. Therefore that I may doe my dutie to you good maister, and to make a white sonne of you, I will beswinge iealousie out of you, as you shall loue me the better while you liue. Smith. What beate thy maister knaue? Clowne. What beat thy man knaue? and I maister, and double beate you, because you are a man of credit, and therefore haue at you, the fairest of fortie pence. Smith. Alasse wife, helpe, helpe, my man kils me. Wife. Nay, euen as you haue baked, so brue, iealousie must be driuen out by extremities. Clowne. and that will I do, mistresse. Smith. Hold thy hand Adam, and not onely I forgiue and forget all, but I will giue thee a good Farme to liue on. Clowne. Be gone Peasant, out of the compasse of my further wrath, for I am a corrector of vice, and at night I wil bring home my mistresse. Smith. Euen when you please good Adam. Clowne. When I please, marke thy words, tis a lease parol, to haue and to hold, thou shalt be mine for euer, and so lets go to the ale-house. Exeunt. Oseas. Where seruants gainst maisters do rebell, The Common-weale may be accounted hell. For if rhe feete the head shall hold in scorne, The Cities state will fall and be forlorne. This error London, waiteth on thy state, Seruants amend, and maisters leaue to hate. Let loue abound, and vertue raigne in all, So God will hold his hand that threatneth thrall. Enter the Marchants of Tharsus, the M. of the ship, some Sailers, wet from sea, with them the Gouernour of Ioppa. Gouer. Iop. What strange encounters met you on the sea? That thus your Barke is battered by the flouds, And you returne thus sea-wrackt as I see. Mer. Most mightie gouernor the chance is strange, The tidings full of wonder and amaze, Which better then we, our M. can report. Gouer. M. discourse vs all the accident. M. The faire Triones with their glimmering light Smil'd at the foote of cleare Rootes a raine, And in the wrath distinguishing the houres, The Laod-starre of our course dispearst his cleare, When to the seas with blithfull westerne blasts, We saild amaine, and let the bowling flie? Scarce had we gone ten leagues from sight of land, But lo an hoast of blacke and sable cloudes, Gan to eclips Lucinas siluer face, And with a hurling noise from forth the South, A gust of winde did raise the billowes vp, Then scantled we our sailes with speedie hands, And tooke our drablers from our bonnets straight, And seuered our bonnets from our courses, Our topsailes vp, we trusse our spritsailes in, But vainely striue they that resist the heauens. For loe the waues incence them more and more, Mounting with hideous roarings from the depth, Our Barke is battered by incountring stormes, And welny stemd by breaking of the flouds, The steers-man pale, and carefull holds his helme, Wherein the trust of life and safetie lay, Till all at once (a mortall tale to tell) Our sailes were split by Bisas bitter blast, Our rudder broke and we bereft of hope, There might you see with pale and gastly lookes, The dead in thought, and dolefull marchants lifts, Their eies and hands vnto their Countries Gods, The goods we cast in bowels of the sea, A sacrifice to swage proud Neptunes ire, Onely alone a man of Israell, A passenger, did vnder hatches lie, And slept secure, when we for succour praide: Him I awooke, and said: why slumberest thou? Arise and pray, and call vpon thy God, He will perhaps in pittie looke on vs. Then cast we lots to know by whose amisse Our mischiefe come, according to the guise, And loe the lot did vnto Ionas fall, The Israelite of whom I told you last, Then question we his Country and his name, Who answered vs, I am and Nebrue borne Who feare the Lord of Heauen, who made the sea, And fled from him for which we all are plagu'd, So to asswage the fury of my God, Take me and cast my carkasse in the sea, Then shall this stormy winde and billow cease. The heauens they know, the Hebrues God can tell, How loth we were to execute his will: But when no Oares nor labour might suffise, We heaued the haplesse Ionas ouer-boord. So ceast the storme, and calmed all the sea, And we by strength of oares recouered shoare. Gouer. A wondrous chance of mighty conseauence. Mer. Ah honored be the god that wrought the same, For we haue vowd, that saw his wondrous works, To cast away prophaned Paganisme, And count the Hebrues God the onely God. To him this offering of the purest gold, This mirrhe and Cascia freely I do yeeld. M. And on his alters perfume these Turkie clothes, This gassampine and gold ile sacrifice. Sailer. To him my heart and thoughts I will addict, Then suffer vs most mightie Gouernour, Within your Temples to do sacrifice. Gouer. You men of Tharsus follow me, Who sacrifice vnto your God of heauen, And welcome freends to Ioppais Gouernor. Exeunt a sacrifice. Oseas. If warned once, the Ethnicks thus repent, And at the first their errour do lament: What senslesse beasts deuoured in their sinne, Are they whom long perswations cannot winne. Beware ye westerne Cities, where the word Is daily preached both at church and boord: Where maiestie the Gospell doth maintaine, Where Preachers for your good, th?selues do paine. To dally long, and still protract the time, The Lord is iust, and you but dust and slime: Presume not far, delay not to amend, Who suffereth long, will punish in the end. Cast thy account ô London in this case, Then iudge what cause thou hast, to call for grace. Ionas the Prophet cast out of the Whales belly vppon the Stage. Ionas. Lord of the light, thou maker of the word, Behold thy hands of mercy reares me vp, Loe from the hidious bowels of this fish, Thou hast returnd me to the wished aire, Loe here apparant witnesse of thy power, The proud Leniathan that scoures the seas, And from his nosthrils shoures out stormy flouds, Whose backe resists the tempest of the winde, Whose presence makes the scaly troopes to shake, With humble stresse of his broad opened chappes, Hath lent me harbour in the raging flouds. Thus though my sin hath drawne me down to death, Thy mercy hath restored me to life. Bow ye my knees, and you my bashfull eyes, Weepe so for griefe, as you to water would: In trouble Lord, I called vnto thee, Out of the belly of the deepest hell, I cride, and thou didst heare my voice O God: Tis thou hadst cast me downe into the deepe, The seas and flouds did compasse me about, I thought I had beene cast from out thy sight, The weeds were wrapt about thy wretched head, I went vnto the bottome of the hilles, But thou O Lord my God hast brought me vp. On thee I thought when as my soule did faint, My praiers did prease before thy mercie seate. Then will I pay my vowes vnto the Lord, For why, saluation commeth from his throane. The Angell appeareth. Angel. Ionas arise, get thee to Niniuie, And preach to them the preachings that I bad: Haste thee to see the will of heauen perform'd. Depart Angel. Ionas. Iehouah I am Priest to do thy will. What coast is this, and where am I arriu'd? Behold sweete Licas streaming in his boundes, Bearing the walles of haughtie Niniuie, Whereas three hundred towns do tempt the heauen. Faire are the walles pride of Assiria, But lo thy sinnes haue pierced through the cloudes. Here will I enter boldly, since I know My God commands, whose power no power resists. Exit. Oseas. You Prophets learne by Ionas how to liue Repent your sinnes, whilst he doth warning giue. Who knowes his maisters wil anh doth it not, Shall suffer many stripes full well I wot. Enter Aluida in rich attire, with the King of Cilicia, her Ladies. Aluida. Ladies go sit you downe amist this bowre, And let the Eunicks plaie you all a sleepe: Put garlands made of Roses on your heads, And plaie the wantons whilst I talke a while. Lady. Tho beautifull of all the world we will. Enter the bowers. Aluid. King of Cilicias kinde and courteous, Like to thy selfe, because a louely King, Come lay thee downe vpon thy mistresse knee, And I will sing and talke of loue to thee. King Cili. Most gratious Paragon of excellence, It fits not such an abiect Prince as I, To talke with Rasnes Paramour and loue. Al. To talke sweet freend? who wold not talke with thee? Oh be not coy, art thou not onely faire? Come twine thine armes about this snow white neck, A loue-nest for the great Assirian King, Blushing I tell thee faire Cilician Prince, None but thy selfe can merit such a grace. K. Ci. Madam, I hope you mean not for to mock me: Al. No king, faire king, my meaning is to yoke thee. Heare me but sing of loue, then by my sighes, My teares, my glauncing lookes, my changed cheare, Thou shalt perceiue how I do hold thee deare. K. Ci. Sing Madam if you please, but loue in iest, Aluid. Nay, I will loue, and sigh at euery rest. Song. Beautie alasse, where wast thou borne? Thus to hold thy selfe in scorne: When as beautie kist to wooe thee, Thou by Beautie doest vndo mee. Heigh ho, despise me not. I and thou in sooth are one, Fairer thou, I fairer none: Wanton thou, and wilt thou wanton Yeeld a cruell heart to plant on? Do me right and do me reason, Crueltie is cursed treason. Heigho I loue, heigho I loue, Higho, and yet he eies me not. King. Madam your song is passing passionate. Alui. And wilt thou not then pittie my estate? King. Aske loue of them, who pittie may impart. Alui. I aske of thee sweet, thou hast stole my heart. King. Your loue is fixed on a greater King. Alui. Tut womens loue, it is a fickle thing. I loue my Rasni for my dignitie. I loue Cilician King for his sweete eye. I loue my Rasni since he rules the world. But more I loue this kingly little world. Embrace him. How sweete he lookes? Oh were I Cithias Pheere, And thou Endimion, I should hold thee deere: Thus should mine armes be spread about thy necke. Embrace his necke. Thus would I kisse my loue at euerie becke. Kisse. Thus would I sigh to see thee sweeeetly sleepe, And If thou wakest not soone, thus would I weepe. And thus, and thus, and thus: thus much I loue thee. Kisse him. King. For all these vowes, beshrow me if I proue you: My faith vnto my King shall not be falc'd. Alui. Good Lord how men are coy when they are crau'd? King. Madam, behold our King approacheth nie. Alui. Thou art Endimion, then no more, heigho for him I die. Faints. Point at the King of Cilicia. Enter Rasni, with his Kings and Lords. What ailes the Center of my happinesse, Whereon depends the heauen of my delight? Thine eyes the motors to command my world, Thy hands the axier to maintaine my world. Thy smiles, the prime and spring-tide of my world. Thy frownes, the winter to afflict the world. Thou Queene of me, I King of all the world. Alui. Ah feeble eyes lift vp and looke on him. She riseth as out of a trance. Is Rasni here? then droupe no more poore heart, Oh how I fainted when I wanted thee? (Embrace him. How faine am I, now I may looke on thee? How glorious is my Rasni? how diuine? Eunukes play himmes, to praise his deitie: He is my Ioue, and I his Iuno am. Rasni. Sun-bright, as is the eye of summers day, When as he sutes Spenori all in gold, To wooe his Leda in a swanlike shape. Seemely as Galbocia for thy white: Rose-coloured, lilly, louely, wanton, kinde, Be thou the laborinth to tangle loue, Whilest I command the crowne from Venus crest: And pull Onoris girdle from his loines, Enchast with Carbunckles, and Diamonds, To beautifie faire Aluida my loue. Play Eunukes, sing in honour of her name, Yet looke not slaues vpon her woing eyne, For she is faire Lucina to your King, But fierce Medusa to your baser eye. Alui. What if I slept, where should my pillow be? Rasni. Within my bosome Nimph, not on my knee, Sleepe like the smiling puritie of heauen, When mildest wind is loath to blend the peace, Meane-while thy blame shall from thy breath arise, And while these closures of thy lamps be shut, My soule may haue his peace from fancies warre. This is my Morane, and I her Cephalus. Wake not too soone sweete Nimph, my loue is wonne: Catnies, why staie your straines, why tempt you me? Enter the Priest of the sun, with the miters on their heads, carrying fire in their hands. Priest. All haile vnto Th'assirian deitie. Ras. Priests why presume you to disturbe my peace? Priest. Rasni, the destinies disturbe thy peace. Behold amidst the addittes of our Gods, Our mightie Gods the patrons of our warre. The ghost of dead men howling walke about, Crying Ve, Ve, woe to this Citie woe. The statutes of our Gods are throwne downe, And streames of blood our altars do distaine. Aluida. Ah-lasse my Lord, what tidings do I heare? Shall I be slaine? She starteth. Rasni. Who tempteth Aluida? Go breake me vp the brazen walles of dreames, And binde me cursed Morpheus in a chaine, And fetter all the fancies of the night, Because they do disturbe my Aluida. A hand from out a cloud, threatneth a burning sword. K. Cili. Behold dread Prince, a burning sword from heauen, Which by a threatning arme is brandished. Rasni. What am I threatned then amidst my throan? Sages? you Magie speake: what meaneth this? Sages. These are but clammy exhalations, Or retrograde, coniunctions of the starres, Or oppositions of the greater lights. Or radiatrous finding matter fit, That in the starrie Spheare kindled be, Matters betokening dangers to thy foes, But peace and honour to my Lord the King. Rasni. Then frolicke Uiceroies, kings &amp; potentates, Driue all vaine fancies from your feeble mindes. Priests go and pray, whilst I prepare my feast, Where Aluida and I, in pearle and gold, Will quaffe vnto our Nobles, richest wine, In spight of fortune, fate, or destinie. Exeunt. Oseas. Woe to the traines of womens foolish lust, In wedlocke rights that yeeld but little trust. That vow to one, yet common be to all, Take warning wantons, pride will haue a fall. Woe to the land, where warnings profit nought, Who say that nature, Gods decrees hath wrought. Who build on fate, and leaue the corner stone, The God of Gods, sweete Christ the onely one. If such escapes ô London reigne in thee: Repent, for why each sin shall punisht be. Repent, amend, repent the houre is nie, Defer not time, who knowes when he shall die? Enters one clad in diuels attire alone. Longer liues a merry man then a sad, and because I meane to make my selfe pleasant this night, I haue put my selfe into this attire, to make a Clowne afraid, that passeth this way: for of late there haue appeared many strange apparitions, to the great feare and terror of the Citizens. Oh here my yoong maister comes. Enters Adam and his mistresse. Adam. Fear not mistresse, ile bring you safe home, if my maister frowne, then will I stamp and stare, and if all bee not well then, why then to morrow morne put out mine eyes cleane with fortie pound. Wife. Oh but Adam, I am afraid to walke so late because of the spirits that appeare in the Citie. Adam. What are you afraid of spirits, armde as I am, with Ale, and Nutmegs, turne me loose to all the diuels in hell. Wife. Alasse Adam, Adam, the diuell, the diuell. Adam. The diuell mistresse, flie you for your safegard, let mee alone, the diuell and I will deale well inough, if hee haue any honestie at all in him, Ile either win him with a smooth tale, or else with a toast and a cup of Ale. The Diuell sings heere. Diuell. Oh, oh, oh, oh, faine would I bee, If that my kingdome fulfilled I might see. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Clowne. Surely this is a merry diuell, and I beleeue hee is one of Lucifers Minstrels, hath a sweet voice, now surely, surely, he may sing to a paire of Tongs and a Bag-pipe. Diuell. Oh thou art he that I seeke for. Clowne. Spiritus santus, away from me satan, I haue nothing to do with thee. Diuell. Oh villaine thou art mine. Clown. Nominus patrus, I blesse me from thee, and I coniure thee to tell me who thou art? Diuell. I am the spirit of the dead man that was slaine in thy company when we were drunke togither at the Ale. Clown. By my troth sir, I cry you mercy, your face is so changed, that I had quite forgotten you, well maister diuell we haue tost ouer many a pot of ale togither. Diuell. And therefore must thou go with me to hell. Clowne. I haue a pollicie to shift him, for I know hee comes out of a hote place, and I know my selfe, the Smith and the diuel hath a drie tooth in his head, therefore will I leaue him asleepe, and run my way. Diuell. Come art thou readie. Clowne. Faith sir my old freend, and now goodman diuell, you know, you and I haue beene tossing many a good cup of ale, your nose is growne very rich, what say you, will you take a pot of ale now at my hands, hell is like a Smiths forge full of water, and yet euer a thrust. Diuell. No Ale villaine, spirits cannot drinke, come get vp on my backe, that I may carrie thee. Clowne. You know I am a Smith sir, let mee looke whither you be wel shod or no, for if you want a shoe, a remoue, or the clinching of a naile, I am at your command. Diuell. Thou hast neuer a shoe fit for me. Clowne. Why sir, we shooe horned beasts as well as you, Oh Good Lord, let me sit downe and laugh, hath neuer a clouen foot, a diuell quoth he, ile vse spritus santus nor nominus patrus no more to him, I warrant you, Ile do more good vpon him with my cudgell, now will I sit me downe and become Iustice of peace to the diuell. Diuell. Come art thou readie? Clowne. I am readie. And with this cudgell I will coniure thee. Diuell. Oh hold thy hand, thou kilst me, thou kilst me. Clowne. Then may I count my selfe I think a tall man, that am able to kill a diuell. Now who dare deale with me in the parish, or what wench in Niniuie will not loue me, when they say, there goes he that beat the diuell. Enters Thrasibulus. Thrasi. Loathed is the life that now inforc'd I lead, But since necessitie will haue it so, (Necessitie it doth command the Gods) Through euery coast and corner now I prie. To pilfer what I can to buie me meate. Here haue I got a cloake not ouer old, Which will affoord some little sustenance, Now will I to the broaking Usurer, To make exchange of ware for readie coine. Alcon. Wife bid the trumpets sound a prize, a prize, mark the posie, I cut this from a new married wife, by the help of a horne thombe and a knife, sixe shillings foure pence. Smia. The better lucke ours, but what haue we here, cast apparell? Come away man, the Usurer is neare, this is dead ware, let it not bide on our hands. Thrasi. Here are my partners in my pouertie, Inforc'd to seeke their fortunes as I do. Ah-lasse that fewe men should possesse the wealth, And many soules be forc'd to beg or steale. Alcon well met. Alcon. Fellow begger whither now? Thrasi. To the Usurer to get gold on commoditie. Alcon. And I to the same place to get a vent for my villany, see where the old crust comes, let vs salute him. God speed sir, may a man abuse your patience vpon a pawne? Vsurer. Friend let me see it. Alcon. Ecce signum, a faire doublet and hose, new bought out of the pilferers shop, a hansome cloake. Vsurer. How were they gotten? Thrasi. How catch the fisher-men fish? M. take them as you thinke them worth, we leaue all to your conscience. Vsurer. Honest men, toward men, good men, my freends, like to prooue good members, vse me, command me, I will maintaine your credits, there's mony, now spend not your time in idlenesse, bring me commoditie, I haue crownes for you, there is two shillings for thee, and six shillings for thee. Alcon. A bargaine, now Samia haue at it for a new smocke, come let vs to the spring of the best liquor, whilest this lasts, trillill. Vsurer. Good fellowes, proper fellowes, my companions, farwell, I haue a pot for you. Samia. If he could spare it. Enters to them Ionas. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent, The day of iudgement comes. When greedie hearts shall glutted be with fire. When as corruptions vailde, shall be vnmaskt. When briberies shall be repaide with bane. When whoredomes shall be recompenc'd in hell. When riot shall with rigor be rewarded. When as neglect of truth, contempt of God, Disdaine of poore men, fatherlesse and sicke Sall be rewarded with a bitter plague. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent. The Lord hath spoke, and I do crie it out. There are as yet, but fortie daies remaining, And then shall Niniuie be ouerthrowne. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent. There are as yet but fortie daies remaining, And then shall Niniuie be ouerthrowne. Exit. Vsur. Confusd in thought, oh whither shall I wend? (Exit. Thrasi. My conscience cries that I haue done amisse. (Exit. Alcon. Oh God of heauen, gainst thee haue I offended. (Exit. Samia. Asham'd of my misdeeds, where shall I hide me? (Exit. Clesi. Father me thinks this word repent is good, He that punish disobedience. Doth hold a scourge for euery priuie fault. (Exit. Oseas. Look London looke, with inward eies behold, What lessons the euents do here vnfold. Sinne growne to pride, to miserie is thrall, The warning bell is rung, beware to fall. Ye worldly men whom wealth doth lift on hie, Beware and feare, for worldly men must die. The time shall come, where least respect remaines, The sword shall light vpon the wisest braines. The head that deemes to ouer-top the skie, Shall perish in his humaine pollicie. Lo I haue said, when I haue said the truth, When will is law, when folly guideth youth. When shew of zeale is prankt in robes of zeale, When Ministers powle the pride of c?mon-weale? When Law is made a laborinth of strife, When honour yeelds him freend to wicked life. When Princes heare by others eares their follie, When Vsury is most accounted holie. If these should hap, as wold to God they might not, The plague is neare, I speake although I write not. Enters the Angell. Angell. Oseas. Oseas. Lord. An. Now hath thine eies perus'd these hainous sins, Hatefull vnto the mightie Lord of hostes, The time is come, their sinnes are waxen ripe, And though the Lord forewarnes, yet they repent not: Custome of sinne hath hardened all their hearts, Now comes reuenge armed with mightie plagues, To punish all that liue in Niniuie, For God is iust, as he is mercifull, And doubtlesse plagues all such as scorne repent, Thou shalt not see the desolation That falles vnto these cursed Niniuites. But shalt returne to great Hierusalem, And preach vnto the people of thy God, What mightie plagues are incident to sinne, Unlesse repentance mittigate his ire: Wrapt in the spirit as thou wert hither brought, Ile seate thee in Iudeas prouinces, Feare not Oseas then to preach the word. Oseas. The will of the Lord be done. Oseas taken away. Enters Rasni with his Viceroyes, Aluida and Ladies, to a banquet. Rasni. So Uiceroyes you haue pleasde mee passing well, These curious cates are gratious in mine eye. But these Borachious of the richest wine, Make me to thinke how blythsome we will be. Seate thee faire Iuno in the royall throne, And I will serue thee to see thy face, That feeding on the beautie of thy lookes, My stomacke and mine eyes may both be fild. Come Lordings seate you, fellow mates at feast, And frolicke wags, this is a day of glee, This banquet is for brightsome Aluida. Ile haue them skinckt my standing bowles of wine, And no man drinke, but quaffe a full carouse, Unto the health of beautious Aluida. For who so riseth from this feast not drunke, As I am Rasni, Niniuies great King, Shall die the death as traitor to my selfe, For that he scornes the health of Aluida. K. Cili. That will I neuer do my Lord. Therefore with fauour, fortune to your grace, Carowse vnto the health of Aluida. Rasni. Gramercie Lording, here I take thy pledge. And Creete to thee a bowle of Greekish wine, Here to the health of Aluida. Creete. Let come my Lord, Iack scincker fill it ful, I pledge vnto the health of heauenly Aluida. Rasni. Uassals attendant on our royall feasts, Drinke you I say vnto my louers health, Let none that is in Rasnes royall Court, Go this night safe and sober to his bed. Enters the Clowne. Clowne. This way he is, and here will I speake with him. Lord. Fellow, whither pressest thou? Clowne. I presse no bodie sir, I am going to speake with a friend of mine. Lord. Why slaue, here is none but the king and his Uiceroyes. Clowne. The King, marry sir he is the man I would speake withall. Lord. why calst him a friend of thine? Clowne. I marry do I sir, for if he be not my friend, ile make him my friend, ere he and I passe. Lord. Away vassaile be gone, thou speake vnto the king. Clowne. I marry will I sir, and if he were a King of veluet, I will talke to him. Rasni. Whats the matter there, what noise is that? Clowne. A boone my Liege, a boone my Liege. Rasni. What is it that great Rasni will not grant This day, vnto the meanest of his land? In honour of his beautious Aluida? Come hither swaine, what is it that thou crauest? Clowne. Faith sir nothing, but to speake a few sentences to your worship. Rasni. Say, what is it? Clown. I am sure sir you haue heard of the spirits that walke in the Citie here. Rasni. I, what of that? Clown. Truly sir, I haue an oration to tel you of one of them, and this it is. Alui. Why goest not forward with thy tale? Clowne. Faith mistresse, I feele an imperfection in my voice, a disease that often troubles mee, but alasse, easily mended, a cup of Ale, or a cup of Wine, will serue the turne. Alui. Fill him a bowle, and let him want no drinke. Clowne. O what a pretious word was that, and let him want no drinke. Well sir, now ile tell you foorth my tale. Sir as I was comming alongst the port ryuale of Niniuie, there appeared to me a great diuell, and as hard fauoured a diuell as euer I saw: nay sir, he was a cuckoldly diuell, for hee had hornes on his head. This diuell, marke you now, presseth vppon me, and sir indeed, I charged him with my pike staffe: but when that wold not serue, I came vpon him with sprytus santus, why it had bin able to haue put Lucifer out of his wits, when I sawe my charme would not serue, I was in such a perplexitie, that sixe penny-worth of Iuniper would not haue made the place sweete againe. Alui. Why fellow wert thou so afraid? Clowne. Oh mistresse, had you beene there and seene, his very sight had made you shift a cleane smocke, I promise you though I were a man, and counted a tall fellow, yet my Landresse calde me slouenly knaue the next day. Rasni. A pleasaunt slaue, forward sirrha, on with thy tale. Clown. Faith sir, but I remember a word that my mistresse your bed-fellow spoake. Rasni. What was that fellow? Clowne. Oh sir, a word of comfort, a pretious word: and let him want no drinke. Rasni. Her word is lawe: and thou shalt want no drinke. Clowne. Then sir this diuell came vpon mee, and would not be perswaded, but he would needs carry me to hell, I proffered him a cup of Ale, thinking because he came from so hotte a place, that he was thirstie, but the diuell was not drie, and therefore the more sory was I, well, there was no remedie, but I must with him to hell, and at last I cast mine eye aside, if you knew what I spied, you would laugh, sir I lookt from top to toe, and he had no clouen feete. Then I ruffled vp my haire, and set my cap on the one side, &amp; sir grew to be a Iustice of peace to the diuell. At last in a great fume, as I am very choloricke, and sometime so hotte in my fustin fumes, that no man can abide within twentie yards of me, I start vp, and so bombasted the diuell, that sir he cried out, and ranne away. Alui. This pleasant knaue hath made me laugh my fill. Rasni, now Aluida begins her quaffe, And drinkes a full carouse vnto her King. Rasni. I pledge my loue, as hartie as great Ioue Drunke, when his Iuno heau'd a bowle to him. Frolicke my Lord, let all the standerds walke. Ply it till euery man hath tane his load. How now sirrha, what cheere: we haue no words of you? Clown. Truly sir, I was in a broune study about my mistresse. Alui. About me, for what? Clowne. Trulie mistresse, to thinke what a golden sentence you did speake: all the philosophers in the world could not haue said more: what come let him want no drinke. Oh wise speech. Alui. Uillaines, why skinck you not vnto this fellow? He makes me blyth and merry in my thoughts. Heard you not that the King hath giuen command, That all be drunke this day within his Court, In quaffing to the health of Aluida? Enters Ionas. Ionas. Repent, repent, ye men of Niniuie repent. The Lord hath spoken, and I do crie it out, There are as yet but fortie daies remaining, And then shall Niniuie be ouerthrowne. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent. Rasni. What fellow is this, that thus disturbs our feasts, With outcries and alarams to repent? Clowne. Oh sir, tis one goodman Ionas that is come from Iericho, and surely I thinke hee hath seene some spirit by the way, and is fallen out of his wits, for he neuer leaues crying night nor day, my maister heard him, and he shut vp his shop, gaue me my Indenture, and he and his wife do nothing but fast and pray. Ionas. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent. Rasni. Come hither fellow, what art, &amp; from whence commest thou? Ionas. Rasni, I am a Prophet of the Lord, Sent hither by the mightie God of hostes, To cry destruction to the Niniuites, O Niniuie, thou harlot of the world, I raise thy neighbours round about thy bounds, To come and see thy filthinesse and sinne. Thus saith the Lord, the mightie God of hoste, Your King loues chambering and wantonnesse, Whoredome and murther do distaine his Court, He fauoureth couetous and drunken men. Behold therefore all like a strumpet foule, Thou shalt be iudg'd and punisht for thy crime: The foe shall pierce the gates with iron rampes, The fire shall quite consume thee from aboue. The houses shall be burnt, the Infants slaine. And women shall behold their husbands die. Thine eldest Sister is Lamana. And Sodome on thy right hand seated is. Repent ye men of Niniuie, repent. The Lord hath spoke, and I do crie it out. There are as yet but fortie daies remaining, And then shall Niniuie be ouerthrowne. Exit. Offered. Rasni. Staie Prophet, staie. Ionas. Disturbe not him that sent me, Let me performe the message of the Lord. Exit. Rasni. My soule is buried in the hell of thoughts. Ah Aluida, I looke on thee with shame. My Lords on suddaine fixe their eyes on ground, As if dismayd to looke vpon the heauens. Hence Magi, who haue flattered me in sinne. Exit. His Sages. Horror of minde, disturbance of my soule, Makes me agast, for Niniuies mishap. Lords see proclaym'd, yea see it straight proclaim'd, That man and beast, the woman and her childe, For fortie daies in sacke and ashes fast, Perhaps the Lord will yeeld and pittie vs. Beare hence these wretched blandishments of sinne, And bring me sackcloth to attire your King. Away with pompe, my soule is full of woe: In pittie looke on Niniuie, O God. Exit. A man. Alui. Assaild with shame, with horror ouerborne, To sorrowes sold, all guiltie of our sinne. Come Ladies come, let vs prepare to pray, Ah-lasse, how dare we looke on heauenly light, That haue dispisde the maker of the same? How may we hope for mercie from aboue, That still despise the warnings from aboue? Woes me, my conscience is a heauie foe. O patron of the poore opprest with sinne, Looke, looke on me, that now for pittie craue, Assaild with shame, with horror ouerborne, To sorrow sold, all guiltie of our sinne. Come Ladies come, let vs prepare to pray. Exeunt. Enter the Vsurer, solus, with a halter in one hand, a dagger in the other. Vsurer. Groning in conscience, burdened with my crimes, The hell of sorrow haunts me vp and downe. Tread where I list, mee-thinkes the bleeding ghostes Of those whom my corruption brought to noughts, Do serue for stumbling blocks before my steppes. The fatherlesse and widow wrongd by me. The poore oppressed by my vsurie, Mee-thinkes I see their hands reard vp to heauen, To crie for vengeance of my couetousnesse. Where so I walke, Ile sigh and shun my way. Thus am I made a monster of the world, Hell gapes for me, heauen will not hold my soule. You mountaines shrowde me from the God of truth. Mee-thinkes I see him sit to iudge the earth. See how he blots me out of the booke of life. Oh burthen more then Atna that I beare. Couer me hills, and shroude me from the Lord. Swallow me Licas, shield me from the Lord. In life no peace: each murmuring that I heare, Mee-thinkes the sentence of damnation soundes, Die reprobate, and hie thee hence to hell. The euill angell tempteth him, offering the knife and rope. What fiend is this that tempts me to the death? What is my death the harbour of my rest? Then let me die: what second charge is this? Mee-thinke, I heare a voice amidst mine eares, That bids me staie: and tels me that the Lord As mercifull to those that do repent. May I repent? oh thou my doubtfull soule? Thou maist repent, the iudge is mercifull. Hence tooles of wrath, stales of temptation, For I will pray and sigh vnto the Lord. In sackcloth will I sigh, and fasting pray: O Lord in rigor looke not on my sinnes. He sits him down in sack-cloathes, his hands and eyes reared to heauen. Enters Aluida with her Ladies, with dispiersed lookes. Alui. Come mournfull dames lay off your brodred locks, And on your shoulders spread dispiersed haires, Let voice of musicke cease, where sorrow dwels. Cloathed in sackcloaths, sigh your sinnes with me. Bemone your pride, bewaile your lawlesse lusts, With fasting mortifie your pampered loines: Oh thinke vpon the horrour of your sinnes. Think, think, with me, the burthen of your blames, Woe to thy pompe, fall, beautie, fading flowre, Blasted by age, by sicknesse, and by death. Woe to our painted cheekes, our curious oyles, Our rich array, that fostered vs in sinne. Woe to our idle thoughts that wound our soules. Oh would to God, all nations might receiue, A good example by our greeuous fall. Ladies. You that are planted there where pleasure dwels, And thinkes your pompe as great as Niniuies, May fall for sinne as Niniuie doth now. Alui. Mourn, mourn, let moane be all your melodie, And pray with me, and I will pray for all. Lord. O Lord of heauen forgiue vs our misdeeds. Ladies. O Lord of heauen forgiue vs our misdeeds. Vsurer. O Lord of light forgiue me my misdeeds. Enters Rasni, the kings of Assiria, with his nobles in sackcloath. K. Cilicia. Be not so ouercome with greefe O king, Least you indanger life by sorrowing so. Rasni. King of Cilicia, should I cease my greefe, Where as my swarming sinnes aflict my soule? Uaine man know, this my burthen greater is, Then euery priuate subiect in my land: My life hath beene a loadstarre vnto them, To guide them in the laborinth of blame, Thus I haue taught them for to do amisse: Then must I weepe my freende for their amisse, The fall of Niniuie is wrought by me: I haue maintaind this Citie in her shame. I haue contem'd the warnings from aboue. I haue vpholden incest, rape, and spoile. Tis I that wrought thy sinne, must weepe thy sinne. Oh had I teares like to the siluer streames, That from the Alpine Mountaines sweetly streame, Or had I sighes the treasures of remorse, As plentifull as Æolus hath blasts, I then would tempt the heauens with my laments, And pierce the throane of mercy by my sighes. K. Cil. Heauens are prepitious vnto faithful praiers. Rasni. But after our repent, we must lament: Least that a worser mischiefe doth befall. Oh pray, perhaps the Lord will pitie vs. Oh God of truth both mercifull and iust, Behold repentant men with pitious eyes, We waile the life that we haue led before. Oh pardon Lord, O pitie Niniuie. Omnes. O pardon Lord, O pitie Niniuie. Rasni. Let not the Infants dallying on the tent, For fathers sinnes in iudgement be opprest. K. Cil. Let not the painfull mothers big with child, The innocents be punisht for our sinne. Rasni. O pardon Lord, O pittie Niniuie. Omnes. O pardon Lord, O pittie Niniuie. Rasni. O Lord of heauen, the virgins weepe to thee. The couetous man sorie for his sinne. The Prince and poore, all pray before thy throane. And wilt thou then be wroth with Niniuie? K. Cili. Giue truce to praier O king, and rest a space. Rasni. Giue truce to praiers, when times require no truce? No Princes no. Let all our subiects hie Unto our temples, where on humbled knees, I will exspect some mercy from aboue. Enter the temple Omnes. Enters Ionas, solus. Ionas. This is the day wherein the Lord hath said. That Niniuie shall quite be ouerthrowne. This is the day of horror and mishap, Fatall vnto the cursed Niniuites. These stately Towers shall in thy watery bounds, Swift flowing Licas find their burials, These pallaces the pride of Assurs kings, Shall be the bowres of desolation, Where as the sollitary bird shall sing, And Tygers traine their young ones to their nest. O all ye nations bounded by the West, Ye happie Iles, where Prophets do abound, Ye Cities famous in the westerne world, Make Niniuie a president for you. Leaue leaud desires, leaue couetous delights. Flie vsurie, let whoredome be exilde, Least you with Niniuie be ouerthrowne. Loe how the sunnes inflamed torch preuailes, Scorching the parched furrowes of the earth. Here will I sit me downe and fixe mine eye Upon the ruines of yon wretched Towne, And lo a pleasant shade, a spreading vine, To shelter Ionas in this sunny heate, What meanes my God, the day is done end spent. Lord shall my Prophecie be brought to nought? When falles the fire? When will the iudge be wroth? I pray thee Lord remember what I said, When I was yet within my country land, Iehouah is too mercifull I feare. O let me flie before a Prophet fault, For thou art mercifull the Lord my God, Full of compassion and sufferance, And doest repent in taking punishment. Why staies thy hand? O Lord first take my life, Before my Prophesie be brought to noughts. Ah he is wroth, behold the gladsome vine That did defend me from the sunny heate, Is withered quite, and swallowed by a Serpent. A serpent deuoureth the vine. Now furious Phlegon triumphs on my browes, And heate preuailes, and I am faint in heart. Enters the Angell. Angell. Art thou so angry Ionas? tell me why? Ionas. Iehouah, I with burning heate am plungd, And shadowed onely by a silly vine. Behold a Serpent hath deuoured it. And lo the sunne incenst by Easterne winde, Afflicts me with Cariculer aspect, Would God that I might die, for well I wot, Twere better I were dead, then rest aliue. Angell. Ionas art thou so angry for the vine, Ionas. Yea I am angry to the death my God. Angell. Thou hast compassion Ionas on a vine, On which thou neuer labour didst bestow, Thou neuer gauest it life or power to grow, Bud suddainly it sprung and suddainly dide. And should not I haue great compassion On Niniuie the Citie of the Lord, Wherein there are a hundred thousand soules, And twentie thousand infants that ne wot The right hand from the left, besides much cattle. Oh Ionas, looke into their Temples now, And see the true contrition of their King: The subiects teares, the sinners true remorse. Then from the Lord, proclaime a mercie day, For he is pittifull as he is iust. Exit, Angelus. Ionas. I go my God to finish thy command, Oh who can tell the wonders of my God: Or talke his praises with a feruent toong. He bringeth downe to hell, and lifts to heauen. He drawes the yoake of bondage from the iust, And lookes vpon the Heathen with piteous eyes, To him all praise and honour be ascribed. Oh who can tell the wonders of my God, He makes the infant to proclaime his truth, The asse to speake, to saue the Prophets life. The earth and sea to yeeld increase for man. Who can describe the compasse of his power? Or testifie in termes his endlesse might? My rauisht spright, oh whither doest thou wend? Go and proclaime the mercy of my God. Relieue the carefull hearted Niniuites. And as thou weart the messenger of death, Go bring glad tydings of recouered grace. Enters Adam solus, with a bottle of beer in one shop, and a great peece of beefe in an other. Wel good-man Ionas, I would you had neuer come from Iury to this Country, you haue made me looke like a leane rib of roast beefe, or like the picture of lent, painted vpon a read-herings cob. Alasse maisters, we are commanded by the proclamation to fast and pray, by my troth I could prettely so, so, away with praying, but for fasting, why tis so contrary to my nature, that I had rather suffer a short hanging, then a long fasting. Marke me, the words be these. Thou shalt take no maner of foode for so many daies. I had as leeue he should haue said, thou shalt hang thy selfe for so many daies. And yet in faith I need not finde fault with the proclamation, for I haue a buttry, and a pantry, and a kitchin, about me, for proofe, Ecce signum, this right flop is my pantry, behold a manchet, this place is my kitchin, for loe a peece of beefe. Oh let me repeat that sweet word againe: For loe a peece of beef. This is my buttry, for see, see, my friends, to my great ioy, a bottle of beere. Thus alasse, I make shift to weare out this fasting, I driue away the time, but there go Searchers about to seeke if any man breakes the Kings command. Oh here they be, in with your victuals Adam. Enters two Searchers. 1. Searcher. How duly the men of Niniuie keep the proclamation, how are they armde to repentance? we haue searcht through the whole Citie &amp; haue not as yet found one that breaks the fast. 2. Sear. The signe of the more grace, but staie, here sits one mee thinkes at his praiers, let vs see who it is. 1. Sear. Tis Adam, the Smithes man, how now Adam. Adam. Trouble me not, thou shalt take no maner of foode, but fast and pray. 1. Sear. How deuoutly he sits at his orysions, but stay, meethinkes I feele a smell of some meate or bread about him. 2. Sear. So thinkes me too, you sirrha, what victuals haue you about you? Adam. Uictuals! Oh horrible blasphemie! Hinder me not of my praier, nor driue me not into a chollor, victualles! why hardst thou not the sentence, thou shalt take no foode but fast and pray? 2. Sear. Truth so it should be, but me-thinkes I smell meate about thee. Adam. About me my friends, these words are actions in the Case, about me, No, no: hang those gluttons that cannot fast and pray. 1. Sear. Well, for all your words, we must search you. Adam. Search me, take heed what you do, my hose are my castles, tis burglary if you breake ope a slop, no officer must lift vp an iron hatch, take heede my slops are iron. 2. Sear. Oh villaine, see how he hath gotten victailes, bread, beefe, and beere, where the King commanded vpon paine of death none should eate for so many daies, no not the sucking infant. Adam. Alasse sir, this is nothing but a modicum non necet vt merdicus daret, why sir, a bit to comfort my stomacke. 1. Sear. Uillaine thou shalt be hangd for it. Adam. These are your words, I shall be hangd for it, but first answer me to this question, how many daies haue we to fast stil? 2. Sear. Fiue daies. Adam. Fiue daies, a long time, then I must be hangd? 1. Sear. I marry must thou. Adam. I am your man, I am for you sir, for I had rather be hangd, th? abide so long a fast, what fiue daies? come ile vntrusse, is your halter and the gallowes, the ladder, and all such furniture in readinesse? 1. Sear. I warrant thee, shalt want none of these. Adam. But heare you, must I be hangd? 1. Sear. I marry. Adam. And for eating of meate, then friends, know ye by these presents, I will eate vp all my meate, and drink vp all my drinke, for it shall neuer be said, I was hangd with an emptie stomack. 1. Sear. Come away knaue, wilt thou stand feeding now? Adam. If you be hastie, hang your selfe an houre while I come to you, for surely I will eate vp my meate. 2. Sear. Come lets draw him away perforce. Adam. You say there is fiue daies yet to fast, these are your words. 2. Sear. I sir. Adam. I am for you, come lets away, and yet let me be put in the Chronicles. Enter Ionas, Rasni, Aluida, kings of Cilicia, others royally att?ded. Ionas. Come carefull King, cast off thy mourfull weedes, Exchange thy cloudie lookes to smoothed smiles, Thy teares haue pierc'd the pitious throane of grace, Thy sighes like Imence pleasing to the Lord: Haue bene peace-offerings for thy former pride. Reioyce and praise his name that gaue thee peace. And you faire Nymphs, ye louely Niniuites, Since you haue wept and fasted for the Lord, He gratiously haue tempered his reuenge, Beware hencefoorth to tempt him anymore, Let not the nicenesse of your beautious lookes, Ingraft in you a high presuming minde, For those that climbe, he casteth to the ground, And they that humble be, he lifts aloft. Rasni. Lowly I bend with awfull bent of eye, Before the dread Iehouah, God of hoste, Despising all prophane deuice of man, Those lustfull lures that whilome led awry, My wanton eyes shall wound my heart no more: And she whose youth in dalliance I abus'd, Shall now at last become my wedlocke mate. Faire Aluida looke not so woe begone: If for thy sinne thy sorrow do exceed, Blessed be thou, come with thy holy band, Lets knit a knot to salue our former shame. Alui. With blushing lookes betokening my remorse, I lowly yeeld my King to thy behest, So as this man of God shall thinke it good. Ionas. Woman, amends may neuer come too late. I will thou practise goodnesse, &amp; vertuousnesse, The God of heauen when sinners do repent, Doth more reioyce then in ten thousand iust. Rasni. Then witnesse holie Prophet our accord. Alui. Plight in the presence of the Lord thy God. Ionas. Blest may you be, like to the flouring sheaues That plaie with gentle windes in summer tide, Like Oliue branches let your children spred: And as the Pines in loftie Libanon, Or as the Kids that feed on Lepher plaines, So be the seede and ofsprings of your loines, Enters the Vsurer, Gentleman, and Alcon. Vsurer. Come foorth my freends, whom wittingly I wrongd, Before this man of God, receiue your due, Before our king I meane to make my peace. Ionas, behold in signe of my remorse, I heare restore into these poore mens hands, Their goods which I vniustly haue retaind, And may the heauens so pardon my misdeeds, As I am penitent for my offence. Thrasi. And what through want, from others I purloynd, Behold O King, I proffer forth thy throane. To be restored to such as owe the same. Ionas. A vertuous deed pleasing to God and man, Would God all Cities drowned in like shame, Would take example of these Niniuites. Rasni. Such be the fruites of Niniuies repent, And such for euer may our dealings be, That he that cald vs home in height of sinne, May smile to see our heartie penitence. Uiceroyes proclaime a fast vnto the Lord, Let Israels God be honoured in our land. Let all occasion of corruption die. For who shall fault therein, shall suffer death. Beare witnesse God, of my vnfained zeale. Come holy man, as thou shalt counsaile me, My Court and Citie shall reformed be. Exeunt. Ionas. Wend on in peace, and prosecute this course, You Ilanders on whom the milder aire Doth sweetly breath the balme of kinde increase: Whose lands are fatned with the deawe of heauen, And made more fruitfull then Actean plaines. You whom delitious pleasures dandle soft: Whose eyes are blinded with securitie, Unmaske your selues, cast error cleane aside. O London, mayden of the mistresse Ile, Wrapt in the foldes and swathing cloutes of shame. In thee more sinnes then Niniuie containes. Contempt of God, dispight of reuerend age. Neglect of law, desire to wrong the poore: Corruption, whordome, drunkennesse, and pride. Swolne are thy brows with impudence and shame. O proud adulterous glorie of the West, Thy neighbors burns, yet doest thou feare no fire. Thy Preachers crie, yet doest thou stop thine eares. The larum rings, yet sleepest thou secure. London awake, for feare the Lord do frowne, I set a looking Glasse before thine eyes. O turne, O turne, with weeping to the Lord, And thinke the praiers and vertues of thy Queene, Defers the plague, which otherwise would fall. Repent O London, least for thine offence, Thy shepheard faile, whom mightie God preserue, That she may bide the pillar of his Church, Against the stormes of Romish Antichrist: The hand of mercy ouershead her head, And let all faithfull subiects say, Amen.
