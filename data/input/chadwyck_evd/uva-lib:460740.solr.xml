      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Orpheus. Eurydice. Charon. Pluto. Proserpine. Thracian Men and Women. Manes, Spectres, and Infernal powers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A View of a wild Region of Mount Rhodope. Orpheus, Solus. [Recitative.] The mountains lay open their caves for my home; The trees bend like slaves with an offering of food; The gaunt wolf comes fawning wherever I roam, But an inhospitable race, More cruel than the wolves that prowl the hills of Thrace, Is thirsting for my blood. Where shall I shelter find, Yon savages to shun? Before, around, behind, They multiply in view; They meet me and pursue, O whither shall I run? SCENE II. Enter a Thracian man and woman, with the Chorus. (Air for four voices.) Man. We have found him, rejoice. Woman. He shall not again depart. Man. We shall hear his sweet voice. Woman. He will teach us his art. [This stanza to be repeated by the chorus.] Orpheus. [Recitative.] What fury, Thracians, fires your souls, That howling thus my steps ye hound? Ha! sure some Deity controls! For wond'ring mute they stand around. With eyes appeas'd they kindly gaze; Their fierce and dreadful energy Is alter'd to a mild amaze! They wait, they look with reverence meekâ What would ye, gentle Thracians, speak! What gifts has wand'ring poverty? Duet by a Thracian man and woman. The softly-bleating lamb, Heard afar in the night, And the feather'd voice of spring Fill'd our hearts with delight.â But the voice of the fold, And the song of the tree, Delight our hearts no more, Since we listen'd to thee. Semi-Chorus. The mountain chace we quit for you, And will where'er you fly pursue. Orpheus. [Recitative.] Apollo here his sacred influence shows, And from a dismal fate rescues his bard; Turning the rage of these relenting foes To mild soliciting and kind regard. [Song.] O ever-glorious God of Song, Behold this rude resistless throng, Thy holy power obey, With melting hearts and gentle mien, They crowd the trembling poet's scene, And ask the humanizing lay. Chorus. Again, again, again! Renew the warbled strain. Semi-Chorus. All the day, all the night, We shall listen with delight. Chorus. Again, again, again, Repeat the warbled strain. Orpheus. [Song.] O pity, O some pity show, A wretch like me distress'd; O could your bosoms only know The fears that fill my breast. The lark that hails the morning light, Is hush'd beneath the moon; The lone melodious bird of night Sits silent when 'tis noon. But shall the poet never claim Sweet solace for his weary frame? A Thracian woman. Recitative. Ah, Thracians, sadly faint he sighs, He needs repose, he asks relief; Let us before he dies, Before he cold and silent lies, O let us soothe, with choicest fruit, The tuneful stranger's grief. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Orpheus, Solus. [Recitative.] Propitious, sure, the Gods divine To charity these dire barbarians turn; But lov'd Eurydice, thou life of mine, How long shall I thy absence mourn? SCENE IV. Eurydice and Orpheus. [Recitative.] Eurydice. My love! my life! my Orpheus, Why drooping, so pale, and dejected? Orpheus. Eurydice safe! Eurydice! By what God or what magic protected? Eurydice. Deep in yon cavern, o'er whose gloomy door Green ivy hangs in drapery, Unseen I trembling sat obscure, Spectator of thy jeopardy. But in thy loving arms again, I feel, nor fear, nor grief, nor pain. SCENE V. Enter the Thracians in procession, bearing branches and baskets of fruit, and singing. Th. 1. His couch shall be deck'd with the blossoms of spring, Th. 2. We'll form him in summer an arbour for shade, Th. 3. To his feet the ripe treasures of autumn we'll bring, Th. 4. Nor his bright-blazing hearth shall the winter invade. Orpheus. [Recitative.] Enough! your generous gifts suspend, For all my fearful sorrows end, And my Eurydice restor'd, Restores to joy my bosom's Lord. If e'er ye see her as ye range your rounds, In pastoral haunts, or sylvan bounds, With milder gestures and a tamer air, Pass by the timid fair. Not to contend in strength or strife, Great Nature form'd the lovely sex, But with their smiles to cherish life, When anguish stings or troubles vex. In her supreme and wond'rous plan, A mutual blessing to impart, She fram'd the much-defying mind of man, And woman's much-enduring heart. Him she prompts the wilds to roam, To rouse the prey, to face the blast; Her she taught to deck his home, To tend the young, the sick, the old, And garnish with contented smiles, The labor-earn'd repast. [Song.] [Orpheus.] Of softer mould was woman made, Man's rugged passions to appease: To pain she brings her soothing aid, And pleasure to the couch of care. When pillow'd on her gentle breast, The careful head is lull'd to rest, And to her loving bosom prest, The rankled heart is heal'd and blest. [Semi-Chorus, Menâsing.] Still as thou teachest, Orpheus, Thy precepts we obeyâ The fair divided from our toil, Shall far from danger share the spoil, When we pursue the prey. Chorus. Hail, Orpheus, hail, We yield to thee; Bound by thy law, Who would be free?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Air for four voices.) Man. We have found him, rejoice. Woman. He shall not again depart. Man. We shall hear his sweet voice. Woman. He will teach us his art. [This stanza to be repeated by the chorus.]</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Altar in a Grove. Orpheus and Thracians. [Hymn, by the Chorus.] The bright-ascending God of day, Fills with his glory all the air; Earth gladden'd by the heav'nly ray, Lifts her broad forehead glowing fair. But chiefly in the living frame, Is felt the God's all-cheering power; Life kindles as it darts in flame, And Strength smiles from the night-built tower. Orpheus. [Recitative.] Thus daily, when yon orb of fire Its glorious round displays above the hills, Here let the incense of your songs aspire, To him that with his radiant eye The world's vast concave fills. And often, as the moon returns, Re-lighted from his bright abode, With higher pomp of solemn praise, Adore the God. For every star that burns by night, And every gem, and minist'ring light, That Heav'n and Earth, and Ocean hold, Some emanated ray, Some hue or influence unfold, Of him that gives the day. [Chorus.] We will build him a temple, and his name shall be call'd The glorious, the all-pervading beamâ At his altar continually the good and the fair Shall nurse the emblematic flame, And chant the solemn hymn. Orpheus. But where is my Eurydice, she that alone can give All that the sun sheds on the green-clad plain, Hoar-headed mountain, and blue-mantled main, To all in Nature, and to all that live, Or thought employ, Light, life and joyâ O bring her to me, swains, My ling'ring charmer bring; I pine in wintery solitude, O speed the tardy spring. [Exeunt Chorus. SCENE II. Orpheus, solus. [Recitative.] What time the silv'ry harbinger of day, Upon the eastern hill announc'd the dawn, I left her, as she like Aurora lay, The fringed curtain of her eyes undrawn; And yet she comes not, though the flood of light Has swept from vision the bright morning star, And all the glittering dews in misty flight Have viewless spread themselves in air afarâ And yet she comes not, though the voice of love In vocal sweetness rises from the bowers, And beauty emulous her charms to prove, Invites abroad with fragrancy of flowers. Why stays my fair? the morning freshness flies, Awake, O glory of my sight, arise. [Song.] What is this tingling through my frame, This fiery fondness in my breast, This ever-pleasing, spreading flame, This constant bliss, though never blest? SCENE III. Orpheus and Thracian Men. Thracian Men. In all her wonted haunts we sought the fair, Where the clear streamlet sleeps amidst the green; Near the white waterfall's thought-soothing blair, In the cool grots, that fragrant branches screen, And where the moss-crown'd naiads weep unseen. But neither where the mossy naiads weep, Nor grottos cool, where branches fan the air, Nor where the waterfall leaps from the steep, Nor by the placid stream saw we the gentle fair. Orpheus âsings. Silly fondling heart of mine, In her absence thus to pine; Pining thus at every chance, That hides her from my anxious glance. SCENE IV. Orpheus, Thracian Men and Women. [Recitative.] Thracian Woman. While we, our bosoms light and gay, Rang'd with Eurydice the height, To yonder cavern, frowning fierce dismay, The bands of Pluto bore her from our sight. Orpheus. [Recitative.] O God of day, to whom my praise was given, Where was thy power?âBut I no more Will chant thy pÃ¦ans, flaming light of Heav'n! I'll now the deity of gloom adore,â To the pale Proserpine I must complain, And never worship in thy beams again. [Exit Orpheus. Thracian Man. Where runs the poet with such frantic speed, Beneath his flying feet the grass scarce bends; Ah, sure he meditates some desp'rate deed, Alas, the cavern, see he now descends. Down in that dismal cave forlorn, A horrible and headlong road, Leads to grim Pluto's dread abode: His loss we can but mourn. [Dirge by the Chorus.] Weep, all ye flowing fountains, Bend low, ye stately trees, Moan from your caves, ye mountains, Sigh every airy breeze. With us deplore The sweetest bard no more. Droop your fair heads, ye flowers, And shed your dewy tears, Join, songsters, in your bowers, And all that music cheers. With us deplore The sweetest bard no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Infernal Regions. Orpheus. [Air.] Hail, everlasting fears, horrors and darkness, hail, Welcome, profoundest hell, welcome, ye spectres pale. [Recitative.] Where shall I choose my way? Where may my guideless feet not stray? In this tremendous wilderness of gloom, This labyrinth of Nox and death,â O universal tomb! Around me is silence, as still as the dead, And these dim flames that sickly gleam O'er Lethe's dumb black-rolling stream, But darker horror shed. [Thunder. Hark! shrill lamentings, and desponding cries, Lo, on the pitchy Lethe's blasted strand, Millions of pale and hazy spectres stand, Shades of the tombless dead!â Lo, now he comes, slow plying to the shore, Charon, whom I must next implore; His grizly charnel form, Hoar beard, like vapor troubled in the storm, Grim eye of ire, and knotted brow of thought, With less-appalling power seem fraught, Than those dread hands of wasted ageâ What giant strength could with their youth engage! SCENE II. Charon comes from the boat, and addresses himself to the Spectres. Charon. [Recitative.] Ye peevish shadows, tease no more, Resign to other ghosts the shore, Go, look for those that were your friends, And new as each, from life descends, Upbraid and wail to themâawayâ Nor thus my fated task delay. 1 Spec. All my friends have long gone by, And oft with many a sigh They sought me slain in the NemÃ¦an wood, My murderers too have pass'd, O, why am I the last, Patient my weary century I've stood. Charon. On board, tis now thy time. 2 Spect. Long moulder'd to dust are my gibbetted bones. 3 &amp; 4 Spect. And ours, his ill-taught guilty sons. Charon. Avaunt ye and your crime. [Duet.] Orpheus. (air.) O Charon, O Charon, one moment yet stay, One moment, one moment, O Charon, delay. Charon. Who art thou that pleadest with this strange art? Orpheus. A wretch most forlorn, From all pleasure torn. Charon. Push off, push off, away, let us depart. Orpheus. One moment yet stay, One moment delay. Charon. Alas, poor wretch, it melts my heart. [Charon.] [Recitative.] What would'st thou here, what dost thou seek? Orpheus. Oh, one whose loss is worse than death and night; With her is life and heavenly light. So gentle, so lovely, so holy, so meek, O my Eurydice! Eurydice I seek. Charon. On board, on board, for now I see Calamity is littering plagues to me; A crew of wave-envelop'd seamen come. The swarms of earthquake, nor the hives, That the Volcano or the hero drives, Can match the shipwreck's progenyâ All Hell is as their home. [Orpheus embarks with Charon and Spectres, and as the boat is pushed off, the Chorus of Mariners enters.] Chorus. Make haste, for us return, Make haste, for us return, Our corses on the sand are thrown, And the bird with the flesh, and the dog with the bone, Should serve for tomb and urn. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A wintery view of Hell. Charon and Orpheus. Charon. [Recitative.] This is mysterious Styges' side, Dread ever-freezing, never-frozen tide. Orpheus. O scene supremely drear. Charon. The ceaseless snow, the rattling hail, With everlasting rigor here assail. Eternal winter rages in the storm, Augmenting ever as it howls, And ever changing form: You may not linger here. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A fiery view of Hell. Orpheus. [Recitative.] Here on the brink of fiery Phlegethon, Tremendous Charon bade me wait, Here at the cavern's mouth of Fate, Where three continual streams uniteâ Streams that upward have no head, But flowing from the den of night, Encircle thrice the regions of the dead. Heavier peals the loaded thunder, The solid adamant is cleft asunder, And lo, the palace of the gloomy God Ascends to this infernal light, As the burning ruby, bright, Solemn, sublime, abode. [Exit. SCENE V. The Palace of Pluto is seen rising. The domes and pinnacles first appear, and the whole edifice continues to ascend until the stage presents the interior of a court, with an open door in the middle of the back scene, through which the interior halls are seen, with Pluto and Proserpine on their throne, and surrounded by their attendants. Hymnâsung within. Dark Pluto, ever round thy throne New miseries triumphant rise; And shrilly, with the swelling groan, The chorus of new wretches cries. From thee, O joyless Proserpine, The sorrows and the cares ascend, And all the hopeless ever thine, Still in thy dismal halls attend. SCENE VI. Enter Orpheus. [Recitative.] Orpheus. The gates of living brass, Sternly studded with fierce flickering eyes, Opened to let me pass, Consenting to my sighs. And to my sad entreaty, Black Cerberus restrain'd his triple bay, And all subdued with pity, Made free the dreadful way. Lo, on his throne the King of Hell appears, And by his side mild Proserpine, the queen; He like a comet that inflames the spheres, And she like the pale moon, that rules the night serene. 1 Voice from within. What daring mortal seeks admission, Marring Hell's council in high session? 2 Vo. Why came thy mortal feet to tread, The awful regions of the dead? 1 Vo. Seek'st thou here relief from pleasure, Chas'd too long, and back would'st measure The hurried steps of wild desire, Call sullen Suicide! and she Will open wide all Hell to thee. 2 Vo. Or would'st thou to the goddess of the solemn eye Of perjur'd love, or faithless friendship sigh? The pale and meagre form of Woe, Should guide thy lonely march below. 3 Vo. But if the pain of joy's voluptuous poison, Nor friendship false thy bosom rend, Nor guilt's recoiling sting, Nor love's heart-wounding treason, Why dost thou suppliant bend, And dare the vision of our gloomy King? Orpheus. [Song.] O Pluto, from thy dreadful dome My Love, my gentle love, restore, Eurydice, wilt thou not come, O shall we, fairest, meet no more! [Recitative.] They yield, they yield, Eurydice appears! The sight, but the sight of her banishes my fears. In her arms, in thy arms, my lost love againâ All sorrow is ended, and cured every pain. Semi-Chorus. What God, Almighty God is this! That finds in Hell the means of bliss. Full Chorus. Sing aloud, and rejoice, The wonder proclaim, That Pluto was melted to pityâ And wrapping his face in his mantle of flame, Consented to tuneful entreaty. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REMARKS ON ORPHEUS. The lyrical Drama is a species of composition but little known to the English stage. Nor, perhaps, is it ever likely to become popular in this country, without some previous radical change in the musical taste of the people. The English, perhaps, relish songs and martial airs quite as much as any other people, but of that higher and nobler kind of music, which aspires to express a continued train of feeling, and the varieties of impassioned sentiment, scarcely any notion has yet been conceived by the most popular native composers, and certainly not the slightest idea by the generality of the public. Sometimes, indeed, it has occurred to us, that the performance at Sadler's Wells was laying the foundation of an English original Opera: at least it is indisputable, that many more of the airs of the songs sung at that theatre become popular than those of the Lyceum, which has assumed to itself the style and title of the English Opera Houseâand the dialogue at Sadler's Wells is also, owing to an absurdity in an Act of Parliament, necessarily recited with music. The author of Orpheus has had in view the allegory which is supposed to be couched under the story. The piece opens with the Musician's apprehension of being torn to pieces by the savage inhabitants of Mount Rhodope. It appears, however, that they only pursue him in order to hear him sing; but he has the sagacity to turn this circumstance to their advantage, by persuading them to divide the employment of the sexes to the most obvious and appropriate duties of man and womanâthus covertly describing the primitive institution of society. The second Act opens with the institution of religious worship, and concludes with a lamentation for the loss of Orpheus, which implies, that in the second stage of society the Gods are revered, and honors paid to the memory of the illustrious dead. We are not certain that the author has carried the allegory any further, as the third Act seems only to relate to the story of the piece; but perhaps he may have meant, that the transactions in Hell should indirectly apply to that third stage of society, when mankind, led by the honors paid to illustrious men, to think of their own future existence, give way to vain fancies, and theoretical conceits, as to the state of the spirit after death. It has occurred to us also, that under the denomination of Orpheus and Eurydice, the author may have remotely personified the soul and body; and that the third Act has some mythological relation to the mystery of their separation by death and subsequent re-union. But it is of no use to guess about occult intentions, the piece is obviously a dramatic contrivance to produce a fine scenic spectacle. The part of Orpheus performed by Mr. Braham, with suitable pageantry, would probably render it popular for as many nights as the public endure the majority of modern Operas.</field>
