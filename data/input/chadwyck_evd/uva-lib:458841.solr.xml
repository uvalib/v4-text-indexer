      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Amongst the Grecians there were annuall feasts, To which none were invited as chief guests, Save Princes and their Wives. Amongst the men, There was no argument disputed then, But who best govern'd: And (as't did appeare) He was esteem'd sole Soveraigne for that yeare. The Queens and Ladies argued at that time, For Vertue and for beauty which was prime, And she had the high honour. Two here be, For Beauty one, the other Majesty, Most worthy (did that custome still persever) Not for one yeare, but to be Soveraignes ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[[Actus primus.]] Enter two Captaines, and Mr. Carrol. 1. Capt. When puts my Lord to Sea? 2. Capt. When the winde's faire. Car. Resolve me I intreat, can you not guesse The purpose of this voyage? 1. Capt. Most men thinke The Fleet's bound for the Ilands. Carr. Nay, tis like. The great successe at Cales under the conduct Of such a Noble Generall, hath put heart Into the English: They are all on fire To purchase from the Spaniard. If their Carracks Come deeply laden, wee shall tugge with them For golden spoile. 2. Capt. O, were it come to that! 1 Capt. How Plimouth swells with Gallants! how the streets Glister with gold! You cannot meet a man But trickt in skarffe and feather, that it seemes As if the pride of Englands Gallantry Were harbourd here. It doth appeare (me thinkes) A very Court of Souldiers. Carr. It doth so. Where shall we dine to day? 2. Capt. At the next Taverne by; there's the best wine, 1 Cap. And the best wench, Besse Bridges, she's the flowre Of Plimouth held: the Castle needes no bush, Her beauty drawes to them more gallant Customers Then all the signes ith' towne else. 2. Capt. A sweet Lasse, If I have any judgement. 1. Capt. Now in troth I thinke shee's honest. Carr. Honest, and live there? What, in a publike Taverne, where's such confluence Of lusty and brave Gallants? Honest said you? 2. Capt. I vow she is for me. 1. Capt. For all, I think. I'm sure she's wondrous modest. Carr. But withall Exceeding affable. 2 Capt. An argument that shee's not proud. Carr. No, were she proud, she'd fall. 1 Capt. Well, shee's a most attractive Adamant, Her very beauty hath upheld that house, And gain'd her master much. Carr. That Adamant Shall for this time draw me to, wee'll dine there. 2. Capt. No better motion: Come to the Castle then. Enter M. Spencer, and Capt. Goodlack. Goodl. What, to the old house still? Spenc. Canst blame me, Captaine, Beleeve me, I was never surprisde till now, Or catcht upon the sudden. Goodl. Pray resolve me, Why being a Gentleman of fortunes, meanes, And well revenude, will you adventure thus A doubtfull voyage, when onely such as I Borne to no other fortunes then my sword Should seeke abroad for pillage. Spenc. Pillage, Captaine? No, tis for honor; And the brave societie Of all these shining Gallants that attend The great L. Generall, drew me hither first: No hope of gaine or spoyle. Goodl. I, but what drawes you to this house so oft? Spenc. As if thou knewst it not. Goodl. What, Besse? Spenc. Even she. Goodl. Come, I must tell you, you forget your selfe, One of your birth and breeding, thus to dote Vpon a Tanners daughter: why, her father Sold hydes in Somersetshire, and being trade-falne, Sent her to service. Spenc. Prethee speake no more, Thou telst me that which I would faine forget, Or wish I had not knowne. If thou wilt humor me Tell me shee's faire and honest. Goodl. Yes, and loves you. Spenc. To forget that, were to exclude the rest: All saving that, were nothing. Come let's enter. Enter 2. Drawers. 1. Draw. You are welcome Gentlemen. Shew them into the next roome there. 2. Draw. Looke out a Towell, and some Rolls, a Salt and Trenchers. Spenc. No sir, we will not dine. 2. Draw. I am sure ye would if ye had my stomacke. What wine drinke yee, Sacke or Claret? Spenc. Wheres Besse? 2. Draw. Marry above with three or foure Gentlemen. Spenc. Goe call her. 2. D. Ile draw you a cup of the neatest wine in Plimouth Spen. Ile tast none of your drawing. Goe call Besse. 2. Draw. Theres nothing in the mouthes of these Gallants, but Besse, Besse. Spenc. What sa'y Sir? 2. Draw. Nothing sir, but Ile goe call her presently. Spenc. Tell her who's here. 2. Draw. The devill rid her out of the house for me. Spenc. Sa'y sir? 2 Draw. Nothing but anon anon sir. Enter Besse Bridges. Spenc. See she's come. Bess. Sweet Mr Spencer, y'are a stranger growne, Where have you beene these three dayes? Spenc. The last night Is ate up late, at game: here take this bagge, And lay't up till I call for't. Bess. Sir I shall. Spenc. Bring me some wine. Bess. I know your taste, And I shall please your palate. Goodl. Troth tis a pretty soule. Spenc. To thee I will unbosome all my thoughts, Were her low birth but equall with her beauty Here would I fixe my thoughts. Goodl. You are not mad sir? You say you love her. Spenc. Never question that. Goodl. Then put her to't, win Oportunity, Shee the best bawd: If (as you say) she loves you, She can deny you nothing. Spenc. I have proved her Vnto the utmost test. Examin'd her. Even to a modest force: but all in vaine: Shee'll laugh, conferre, keepe company, discourse, And something more, kisse: but beyond that compasse She no way can be drawne. Goodl. Tis a vertue, But seldome found in tavernes. Enter Besse with wine. Besse. Tis of the best Graves wine sir. Spenc. Gramarcie Girle, come sit. Besse. Pray pardon sir, I dare not. Spenc. Ile ha'it so. Besse. My fellowes love me not, and will complaine Of such a sawcy boldnesse. Spenc. Pox on your fellowes, Ile try whether their pottle pots or heads Be harder, if I doe but heare them grumble. Sit: now Besse drinke to me. Besse. To your good voyage. Enter the second Drawer. 2 Draw. Did you call sir? Sp. Yes sir, to have your absence. Captaine, this health. Goodl. Let it come sir. 2 Draw. Must you be set, and we wait, with aâ Spenc. What say you sir? 2 Draw. Anon, anon, I come there. Exit. Spenc. What will you venture Besse to sea with me? Besse. What I love best, my heart: for I could wish I had beene borne to equall you in fortune, Or you so low, to have beene rankt with me, I could have then presum'd boldly to say, I love none but my Spencer. Spenc. Besse I thanke thee. Keepe still that hundred pound till my returne From th'Islands with my Lord: if never, wench Take it, it is thine owne. Besse. You binde me to you. Enter the first Drawer. 1 Draw. Besse, you must fill some wine into the Portcullis, the Gentlemen there will drinke none but of your drawing. Spenc. She shall not rise sir, goe let your Master snick-up. 1 D. And that should be cousin-german to the hick-up. Enter the second Drawer. 2 Draw. Besse, you must needs come, the gentlemen fling pots, pottles, drawers, and all downe staires. The whole house is in an uprore. Besse. Pray pardon sir, I needs must be gone. 2 D. The Gentlemen sweare if she come not up to th? They will come downe to her. Spenc. If they come in peace, Like ciuill Gentlemen, they may be welcome: If otherwise, let them usurpe their pleasures. We stand prepar'd for both. Enter Caroll and two Captaines. Car. Save you gallants, we are somwhat bold to presse Into your company. It may be held scarce manners, Therefore fit that we should crave your pardon. Spenc. Sir, you are welcome, so are your friends. 1 Capt. Some wine. Besse. Pray give me leave to fill it. Sp. You shall not stir. So please you wee'l joyne c?pany. Drawer, more stooles. Car. I tak't that's a she drawer. Are you of the house? Besse. I am sir. Caroll. In what place? Besse. I draw. Caroll. Beere, doe you not? You are some tapstresse. Spenc. Sir, the worst character you can bestow Vpon the maide is to draw wine. Caroll. She would draw none to us, Perhaps she keepes a Rundlet for your taste, Which none but you must pierce. 2 Capt. I pray be civill. Spenc. I know not, Gentlemen, what your intents be, Nor doe I feare or care. This is my roome, And if you beare you, as you seeme in shew, Like Gentlemen, sit and be sociable. Car. We will. Minx, by your leave: Remove I say. Spenc. She shall not stir. Car. How sir? Spen. No sir: could you out-face the devill, We doe not feare your roaring. Car. Though you may be companion with a drudge, It is not fit shee should have place by us. About your businesse, huswife. Spenc. She is worthy The place as the best here, and she shall keep't. Car. You lie. They bustle. Caroll slaine. Goodl. The Gentleman's slaine, away. Besse. Oh heaven, what have you done? Goodl. Vndone thy selfe and me too: Come away? Besse. Oh sad misfortune, I shall lose him ever. What, are you men or milk sops? Stand you still Senslesse as stones, and see your friend in danger To expire his last? 1 Capt. Tush, all our help's in vaine. 2 Capt. This is the fruit of whoores. This mischiefe came through thee. Besse. It grew first from your incivilitie. 1 Cap. Lend me a hand to lift his body hence. It was a fatall businesse. Exeunt Captaines. Enter the two Drawers. 1 Dr. One call my Master, another fetch the constable, Here's a man kild in the roome. 2 Dr. How, a man kill'd saist thou. Is all paid? 1 Dr. How fell they out, canst thou tell? 2 Dr. Sure about this bold Betrice: tis not so much for the death of the man, but how shall we come by our reckoning? Exeunt Drawers. Besse. What shall become of me! Of all lost creatures The most infortunate. My innocence Hath beene the cause of blood, and I am now Purpled with murder, though not within compasse Of the Lawes severe censure: but which most Addes unto my affliction, I by this Have lost so worthy and approv'd a friend, Whom to redeeme from exile, I would give All that's without and in me. Enter Forset. Fors. Your name's Besse Bridges? Besse. An unfortunate Maid. Knowne by that name too well in Plimouth here. Your businesse, sir, with me? Fors. Know you this Ring? Besse. I doe: it is my Spencers. I know withall you are his trusty friend, To whom he would commit it. Speake, how fares he? Is hee in freedome, know yee? Fors. Hee's in health Of body, though in minde somwhat perplext For this late mischiefe happened. Besse. Is he fled, and freed from danger? Fors. Neither. By this token He lovingly commends him to you Besse, And prayes you when tis darke meet him o'th Hoe Neere to the new-made Fort, where hee'll attend you, Before he flyes, to take a kinde farewell. Theres onely Goodlack in his company, He intreats you not to faile him. Bes. Tell him from me, Ile come, Ile runne, Ile flye, Stand Death before me: were I sure to die. Exit. Enter Spencer and Goodlacke. Goodl. You are too full of passion. Spenc. Canst thou blame me, To have the guilt of murder burden me, And next, my life in hazatd to a death So ignominious: last, to lose a Love So sweet, so faire, so am'rous, and so chaste, And all these at an instant? Art thou sure Carol is dead? Goodl. I can beleeve no lesse. You hit him in the very speeding place. Spenc. Oh but the last of these sits neer'st my heart. Goodl. Sir be advis'd by mee. Try her before you trust her. She perchance May take th'advantage of your hopefull fortunes: But when she findes you subject to distresse And casualty, her flattering love may die: Your deceased hopes. Spenc. Thou counselst well. Ile put her to the test and utmost tryall Before I trust her further. Here she comes. Enter Forset, and Besse with a bagge. Fors. I have done my message sir. Bes. Feare not sweet Spencer, we are now alone, And thou art sanctuar'd in these mine armes. Goodl. While these conferre wee'll centinel their safety. This place Ile guard. Fors. I this. Bes. Are you not hurt? Or your skinne rac'd with his offensive steele? How is it with you? Spenc. Besse, all my afflictions Are that I must leave thee: thou knowst withall My extreame necessity, and that the feare Of a most scandalous death doth force me hence. I am not neare my Country, and to stay From new supply from thence, might deeply ingage mee To desperate hazard. Besse. Is it coyne you want? Here is the hundred pound you gave me late, Vse that, beside what I have stor'd and sav'de Which makes it fifty more: were it ten thousand Nay, a whole million, Spencer, all were thine. Spenc. No, what thou hast keepe still, tis all thine owne. Here be my keyes, my trunkes take to thy charge: Such gold fit for transportage as I have, Ile beare along: the rest are freely thine, Money, apparell, and what else thou findst, Perhaps worth my bequest and thy receiving, I make thee mistresse of. Besse. Before I doted, But now you strive to have me extaside. What would you have me doe, in which t'expresse My zeale to you? Spenc. Which in my chamber hangs, My picture, I injoyne thee to keepe ever, For when thou partst with that, thou losest me. Besse. My soule may from my body be divorc'd, But never that from me. Spenc. I have a house in Foy, a taverne calld The Winde-mill, that I freely give thee too, And thither if I live Ile send to thee. Besse. So soone as I have cast my reckonings up, And made even with my Master, Ile not faile To visit Foy in Cornwall. Is there else Ought that you will injoyne me? Spenc. Thou art faire, Ioyne to thy beauty vertue. Many suiters I know will tempt thee: beauty's a shrewd baite, But unto that if thou add'st chastitie, Thou shalt ore-come all scandall. Time cals hence, We now must part. Besse. Oh that I had the power to make Time lame, To stay the starres, or make the Moone stand still, That future day might never haste thy flight. I could dwell here for ever in thine armes, And wish it alwayes night. Spenc. We trifle howers. Farewell. Besse. First take this Ring: Twas the first token of my constant love That past betwixt us. When I see this next, And not my Spencer, I shall thinke thee dead: For till death part thy body from thy soule I know thou wilt not part with it. Spenc. Sweare for me Besse: for thou maist safely doe't. Once more farewell: at Foy thou shalt heare from me. Besse. Theres not a word that hath a parting sound Which through mine eares shrills not immediate death. I shall not live to lose thee. Fors. Best be gone, for harke I heare some tread. Spenc. A thousand farewels are in one contracted. Captaine away. Exit Spencer, &amp; Goodlacke. Besse. Oh, I shall dye. Fors. What mean you Besse, wil you betray your friend, Or call my name in question? Sweet, looke up. Besse. Hah, is my Spencer gone? Fors. With speed towards Foy, There to take ship for Fiall. Besse. Let me recollect my selfe, And what he left in charge. Vertue and Chastitie. Next, with all sudden expedition Prepare for Foy: all these will I conserve, And keepe them strictly, as I would my life. Plimouth farewell: in Cornwall I will prove A second fortune, and for ever mourne, Vntill I see my Spencers safe returne. Hoboys. A dumbe Show. Enter Generall, Captaines, the Mayor: Petitioners the other way with papers: amongst these the Drawers. The Generall gives them bagges of money. All goe off saving the two Drawers. 1 Draw. Tis well yet we have gotten all the money due to my Master. It is the commonest thing that can bee for these Captaines to score and to score: but when the scores are to be paid, Non est inventus. 2 Draw. Tis ordinary amongst Gallants now a dayes, who had rather sweare forty oaths, then onely this one oath, God let me never be trusted. 1 Draw. But if the Captaines would follow the noble minde of the Generall, before night there would not bee one score owing in Plimouth. 2 Draw. Little knowes Besse that my Master hath got in these desperate debts: but she hath cast up her accounts and is gone. 1 Draw. Whither canst thou tell? 2 Draw. They say to keepe a Taverne in Foy, and that M. Spencer hath given her a stocke to set up for her selfe. Well, howsoever, I am glad, though he kild the man wee have got our money.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus Scena prima. Enter Forset and Roughman. Forset. In your time have you seene a sweeter creature? Roughm. Some weeke or thereabouts. Fors. And in that small time shee hath almost undone all the other Taverns. The Gallants make no rendezvous now but at the Wind-mill. Roughm. Spight of them Ile have her. It shall cost me the setting on but Ile have her. Fors. Why, doe you thinke she is so easily won? Roughm. Easily or not, Ile bid as fayre and farre as any man within twenty miles of my head, but I will put her to the squeake. Fors. They say there are Knights sonnes already come as suiters to her. Roughm. Tis like enough, some younger brothers, and so I intend to make them. Fors. If these doings hold, shee will grow rich in short time. Roughm. There shall bee doings that shall make this Wind-mill my grand seate, my mansion, my pallace, and my Constantinople. Enter Besse Bridges like a Mistresse, and Clem. Fors. Here she comes: observe how modestly she beares her selfe. Roughm. I must know of what burden this vessell is, I shall not beare with her till shee beare with mee, and till then, I cannot report her for a woman of good cariage. Besse. Your olde Master that dwelt here before my comming, hath turn'd over your yeares to me. Clem. Right forsooth: before he was a Vintner, hee was a shoo-maker, and left two or three turne-overs more besides my selfe. Besse. How long hast thou to serve. Clem. But eleven yeares next grasse, and then I am in hope of my freedom. For by that time I shall be at ful age. Besse. How old art thou now? Clem. Forsooth newly come into my Teenes. I have scrap'd trenchers this two yeares, and the next Vintage I hope to be Barre-boy. Besse. What's thy name? Clem. My name is Clem, my father was a Baker, and by the report of his neighbors, as honest a man as ever lived by bread. Bes. And where dwelt he? Clem. Below here in the next crooked street, at the signe of the Leg. Hee was nothing so tall as I, but a little wee-man, and somewhat huckt-backt. Besse. He was once Constable? Clem. Hee was indeede, and in that one yeare of his raigne, I have heard them say, hee bolted and sifted out more businesse, then others in that office in many yeares before him. Besse. How long ist since he dyed? Clem. Marry the last deare yeare. For when corne grew to be at an high rate, my father never dowed after. Besse. I thinke I have heard of him. Clem. Then I am sure you have heard he was an honest neighbor, and one that never lov'd to be meale-mouth'd. Besse. Well sirrah, proove an honest servant, and you shall finde me your good Mistresse. What company is in the Marmaid? Clem. There be foure Sea captaines. I beleeve they be little better then spirats, they are so flush of their rudocks. Bess. No matter, wee will take no note of them. Here they vent many brave commodities, By which some gain accrews. Th'are my good customers, And still returne me profit. Clem. Wot you what Mistresse, how the two Saylers would have served me, that calld for the pound and halfe of Cheese? Bess. How was it Clem? Clem. When I brought them a reckoning, they would have had me to have scor'd it up. They tooke me for a simple gull indeed, that would have had me to have taken Chalke for Cheese. Besse. Well, goe waite upon the Captaines, see them want no wine. Clem. Nor reckoning neyther, take my word Mistress. Roughm. Shee's now at leasure, Ile to her. Lady, what Gentlemen are those above? Besse. Sir they are such as please to be my guests, And they are kindly welcome. Roughm. Give me their names. Besse. You may goe search the Church-booke where they were christned. There you perhaps may learne them. Roughm. Minion, how? Fors. Fie, fie, you are too rude with this faire creature, That no way seekes t'offend you. Bess. Pray hands off. Roughm. I tell thee maid, wife, or what e'er thou beest, No man shall enter here but by my leave. Come, let's be more familiar. Bess. 'Las good-man. R. Why knowst thou wh? thou sleightst. I am Roughman, The onely approved gallant of these parts, A man of whom the Roarers stand in awe, And must not be put off. Bess. I never yet heard man so praise himselfe, But prov'd in'th end a coward. Roughm. Coward, Bess? You will offend me, raise in me that fury Your beauty cannot calme. Goe to, no more, Your language is too harsh and peremptory. Pray let me heare no more on't. I tell thee That quiet day scarce past me these seven yeares I have not crackt a weapon in some fray, And will I you move my spleene? Fors. What, threat a woman? Bes. Sir, if you thus persist to wrong my house, Disturbe my guests, and nightly domineire, To put my friends from patience, Ile complaine, And right my selfe before the Magistrate. Can we not live in compasse of the Law, But must be swaggerd out on't? Roughm. Goe too, wench, I wish thee well, thinke on't, theres good for thee Stor'd in my brest, and when I come in place I must have no man to offend mine eye: My love can brooke no rivals. For this time I am content your Captaines shall have peace, But must not be us'd to't. Bes. Sir if you come like other free &amp; civill Gentlemen Y'are welcome, otherwise my doores are barr'd you. Roughm. That's my good Girle, I have fortunes laid up for thee: what I have Command it as thine owne. Goe too, be wise. Bes. Well, I shall study for't. Roughm. Consider on't. Farewell. Exit. Bes. My minde suggests mee that this prating fellow Is some notorious Coward. If he persist I have a tricke, to try what metall's in him. Enter Clem. What newes with you? Cle. I am now going to carry the Captaines a reckning. Besse. And what's the summe? Clem. Let me see, eight shillings and six pence. Bes. How can you make that good? write them a bill. Clem. Ile watch them for that, tis no time of night to use our bils, the Gentlemen are no dwarfes, and with one word of my mouth, I can tell them what is to be-tall. Besse. How comes it to so much? Clem. Imprimis, six quarts of wine at seven pence the quart, seven sixpences. Besse. Why dost thou reckon it so? Clem. Because as they came in by hab nab, so I will bring them in a reckning at six and at sevens. Bes. Well, wineâ3 s, 6 d. Clem. And what wants that often groats? Besse. Tis two pence over. Clem. Then put six pence more to it, and make it 4 s, wine, though you bate it them in their meate. Besse. Why so I prethee? Clem. Because of the old proverbe, VVhat they want in meate, let them take out in drinke. Then for twelve penyworth of Anchoves, 18 d. Besse. How can that be? Clem. Marry very well Mistresse, 12 d. Anchoves, and 6 d. oyle and vineger. Nay they shall have a sawcy reckoning Bes. And what for the other halfe crowne? Clem. Bread, beere, salt, napkins, trenchers, one thing with another, so the summa totalis isâ8 s, 6 d. Bes. Well, take the reckoning from the bar. Clem. What needs that forsooth? The Gentlemen seem to be high-flowne already, send them in but another pottle of Sacke, and they will cast up the reckoning of themselves. Yes, Ile about it. Bes. VVere I not with so my sutors pesterd, And might I injoy my Spencer, what a sweet Contented life were this? For money flowes And my gaine's great. But to my Roughman next: I have a tricke to try what spirit's in him, It shall be my next businesse: in this passion For my deare Spencer, I propose me this, Mongst many sorrowes some mirth's not amisse, Exit. Enter Spencer, and Goodlacke. Goodl. What were you thinking sir? Spen. Troth of the world, what any man should see in't To be in love with it. Goodl. The reason of your meditation. Spenc. To imagine that in the same instant that one forfets all his estate, another enters upon a rich possession: as one goes to the Church to be marryed, another is hurried to the gallowes to be hang'd, the last having no feeling of the first mans joy, nor the first of the last mans misery. At the same time that one lyes tortured upon the Racke, another lyes tumbling with his Mistresse over head and eares in downe and feathers. This when I truly consider, I cannot but wonder why any fortune should make a man extasy'd. Goodl. You give your selfe too much to melancholy. Spenc. These are my Maximes, and were they as faithfully practised by others, as truly apprehended by me, we should have lesse oppression, and more charitie. Enter the two Captaines that were before. 1 Capt. Make good thy words. 2 Capt. I say thou hast injur'd me. 1 Capt. Tell me wherein. 2 Capt. When we assaulted Fiall, And I had by the Generals command The onset, and with danger of my person Enforc'd the Spaniard to a swift retreat, And beat them from their Fort, thou when thou sawst All feare and danger past, mad'st up with me To share that honour which was sole mine owne, And never ventur'd shot for't, or ere came Where bullet graz'd. Spenc. See Captaine a fray towards, Let's if we can attone this difference. Goodl. Content. 1 Capt. Ile prove it with my sword, That though thou hadst the formost place in field, And I the second, yet my Company Was equall in the entry of the Fort. My sword was that day drawne as soone as thine, And that poore honour which I won that day Was but my merit. 2 Capt. Wrong me palpably And justifie the same? Spenc. You shall not fight. 1 Capt. Why, sir, who made you first a Iusticer, And taught you that word shall? you are no Generall, Or if you be, pray shew us your Commission. Spenc. Sir you have no commission but my counsell, And that Ile shew you freely. 2 Capt. Tis some Chaplaine, 1 Capt. I doe not like his text. Goodl. Let's beate their weapons downe. 1 Cap. Ile aime at him that offers to divide us? 2 Cap. Pox of these part-frayes, see I am wounded By beating downe my weapon. Goodl. How fares my friend? Sp. You sought for blood, and Gentlemen you have it, Let mine appease you, I am hurt to death. 1 Capt. My rage converts to pitie, that this Gentleman Shall suffer for his goodnes. Goodl. Noble friend, I will revenge thy death. Spen. He is no friend That murmurs such a thought. Oh Gentlemen. I kill'd a man in Plimouth, and by you Am slaine in Fiall. Caroll fell by me, And I fall by a Spencer. Heav'n is just, And will not suffer murder unreveng'd, Heaven pardon me, as I forgive you both, Shift for your selves: away. 2 Capt. VVe saw him die, But grieve you should so perish. Spen. Note Heavens justice, And henceforth make that use on't. I shall faint. 1 Capt. Short Farewels now must serve. If thou surviv'st Live to thine honour: but if thou expir'st Heaven take thy soule to mercy. Exeunt. Spenc. I bleed much, I must goe seeke a Surgeon. Goodl. Sir how cheare you? Spenc. Like one thats bound upon a new adventure To th'other world: yet thus much worthy friend Let me intreat you, since I understand The Fleet is bound for England, take your occasion To ship your selfe, and when you come to Foy Kindly commend me to my dearest Besse, Thou shalt receive a Will, in which I have Possest her of five hundred pounds a yeare. Goodl. A noble Legacy. Spenc. The rest I have bestow'd amongst my friends, Onely reserving a bare hundred pounds To see me honestly and well interr'd. Goodl. I shall performe your trust as carefully As to my father, breath'd he. Spenc. Marke me Captaine: Her Legacie I give with this proviso, If at thy arrivall where my Besse remaines, Thou findst her well reported, free from scandall, My VVill stands firme: but if thou hear'st her branded For loose behaviour, or immodest life, VVhat she should have, I here bestow on thee, It is thine owne: but as thou lov'st thy soule Deale faithfully betwixt my Besse and me. Goodl. Else let me dye a prodigie. Spenc. This Ring was hers, that, be she loose or chaste, Being her owne, restore her, she will know it, And doubtlesse she deserves it. Oh my memory, VVhat had I quite forgot? She hath my picture, Goodl. And what of that? Sp. If she be ranckt amongst the loose and lewd, Take it away, I hold it much undecent, A whore should ha't in keeping: but if constant Let her injoy it: this my Will performe As thou art just and honest. Goodl. Sense else forsake me. Spenc. Now lead me to my Chamber, all's mads even, My peace with earth, and my atone with heaven. Enter Besse Bridges like a Page with a sword, and Clem. Bess. But that I know my mother to be chaste, I'de sweare some Souldier got me. Clem. It may be many a Souldiers Buffe Ierkin came out of your fathers Tanne-fat. Besse. Me thinkes I have a manly spirit in me In this mans habit. Clem. Now am not I of many mens mindes, for if you should doe me wrong, I should not kill you, though I tooke you pissing against a wall. Bess. Me thinkes I could be valiant on the sudden: And meet a man i'th field. I could doe all that I have heard discourst Of Mary Ambree or Westminsters Long-Meg. Clem. VVhat Mary Ambree was I cannot tell, but unlesse you were taller you will come short of Long Meg, Bess. Of all thy fellowes thee I onely trust, And charge thee to be secret. Clem. I am bound in my Indentures to keepe my Masters secrets, and should I finde a man in bed with you, I would not tell. Bes. Be gone sir, but no words as you esteeme my favor. Clem. But Mistresse, I could wish you to looke to your long seames, fights are dangerous. But am not I in a sweet taking thinke you? Besse. I prethee why? Clem. Why, if you should swagger and kill any body, I being a Vintner should be calld to the Barre. Besse. Let none condemne me of immodesty, Because I trie the courage of a man Who on my soule's a Coward: beates my servants, Cuffes them, and as they passe by him kickes my maids, Nay domineirs over me, making himselfe Lord ore my house and houshold. Yesternight I heard him make appointment on some businesse To passe alone this way. Ile venture faire, But I will try what's in him. Enter Roughman and Forset. Fors. Sir, I can now no further, weighty businesse Calls me away. Rough. Why at your pleasure then, Yet I could wish that ere I past this field, That I could meet some Hector, so your eyes Might witnesse what my selfe have oft repeated, Namely that I am valiant. Fors. Sir no doubt. But now I am in haste. Farewell. Roug. How many times brave words beare out a man? For if he can but make a noise, hee's fear'd. To talke of fraies, although he ne'er had heart To face a man in field, that's a brave fellow, I have beene valiant I must needs confesse, In street and Taverne, where there have beene men Ready to part the fray: but for the fields They are too cold to fight in. Besse. You are a villaine, a Coward, and you lie. R. You wrong me I protest. Sweet courteous Gentlem? I never did you wrong. Besse. Wilt tell me that? Draw forth thy coward sword, and suddenly, Or as I am a man Ile runne thee through, And leave thee dead ith field. Roug. Hold as you are a Gentleman. I have tane an oath I will not fight to day. Besse. Th'ast tooke a blow already and the lie, Will not both these inrage thee? Rough. No, would you give the bastinado too, I will not breake mine oath. Besse. Oh, your name's Roughman. No day doth passe you but you hurt or kill. Is this out of your calender? Rough. I, you are deceiv'd, I ne'er drew sword in anger I protest, Vnlesse it were upon some poore weake fellow That ne'er wore steele about him. Besse. Throw your Sword. Roug. Here sweet young sir, but as you are a gentleman, Doe not impaire mine honor. Besse. Tye that shooe. Rough. I shall sir. Besse. Vntrusse that point. Rough. Any thing this day to save mine oath. Besse. Enough: yet not enough, lie downe Till I stride ore thee. Rough. Sweet sir any thing. Besse. Rise, thou hast leave. Now Roughman thou art blest This day thy life is sav'd, looke to the rest. Take backe thy sword. Roughm. Oh you are generous: honour me so much As let me know to whom I owe my life. Besse. I am Besse Bridges brother, Roug. Still me thought that you were somthing like her. Besse. And I have heard, You domineir and revell in her house, Controle her servants, and abuse her guests, VVhich if I ever shall hereafter heare, Thou art but a dead man. Roughm. She never told me of a brother living, But you have power to sway me. Bess. But for I see you are a Gentleman, I am content this once to let you passe, But if I finde you fall into relapse, The second's farre more dangerous. Roughm. I shall feare it. Sir will you take the wine? Bess. I am for London. And for these two termes cannot make returne: But if you see my sister, you may say I was in health. Roughm. Too well, the devill take you. Bess. Pray use her well, and at my comming backe Ile aske for your acquaintance. Now farewell. Rough. None saw't: hee's gone for London: I am unhurt, Then who shall publish this disgrace abroad? One man's no slander, should he speake his worst: My tongue's as loud as his, but in this country Both of more fame and credit. Should we contest I can out-face the proudest. This is then My comfort: Roughman, thou art still the same, For a disgrace not seene, is held no shame. Enter two Sailors. 1 Sa. Aboard, aboard, the wind stands faire for England, The ships have all weigh'd anchor. 2 Sail. A stiffe gale blowes from the shore. Enter Captaine Goodlacke. Goodl. The Sailers call aboard, and I am forc'd To leave my friend now at the point of death, And cannot close his eyes. Here is the Will, Now may I finde yon Tanners daughter turn'd Vnchaste or wanton, I shall gaine by it Five hundred pounds a yeare: here is good evidence. 1 Sailor. Sir will you take the long boat and aboard? Enter a third Sailor. Goodl. With all my heart. 3 Sail. What are you ready Mates? 1 Sail. We staid for you. Thou canst not tel who's dead? The great bell rung out now. 3 Sailor. They say twas for one Spencer, who this night Dyde of a mortall wound. Goodl. My worthy friend. Vnhappy man that cannot stay behinde To doe him his last rights. Was his name Spencer? 3 Sail. Yes Sir, a Gentleman of good account And well knowne in the navy. Goodl. This is the end of all mortalitie: It will be newes unpleasing to his Besse. I cannot faire amisse, but long to see Whether these Lands belong to her or mee. Enter Spencer, and his Surgeon. Surg. Nay feare not sir, now you have scap'd this dressing My life for yours. Spenc. I thanke thee honest Friend. Surg. Sir I can tell you newes. Spenc. What ist I prethee? Surg. There is a Gentleman one of your name, That dide within this hower. Spenc. My name? what was he, of what sicknes dide he? Surg. No sicknesse, but a sleight hurt in the body, Which shewed at first no danger, but being searcht, He dyde at the third dressing. Spenc. At my third search I am in hope of life. The heavens are mercifull. Surg. Sir doubt not your recovery. Spenc. That hundred pound I had prepar'd t'expend Vpon mine owne expected Funerall I for name sake will now bestow on his. Surg. A noble resolution. Spenc. What ships are bound for England, I would gladly Venture to sea, though weake. Surg. All bound that way are vnder saile already. Spenc. Here's no securitie, For when the beaten Spaniards shall returne, They'le spoile whom they can finde. Surg. We have a ship, Of which I am Surgeon, that belongs unto A London merchant, now bound for Mamorah A towne in Barbary, please you to use that, You shall command free passage: ten months hence We hope to visit England. Spenc. Friend I thanke thee. Surg. Ile bring you to the Master, who I know Will entertaine you gladly. Spen. When I have seene the funerall rights perform'd To the dead body of my Country man And kinsman, I will take your courteous offer. England no doubt will heare newes of my death, How Besse will take it is to me unknowne: On her behaviour I will build my fate, There raise my love, or thence erect my hate.

Had you but staid the crossing of one field, You had beheld a Hector, the boldest Trojan That ever Roughman met with. Fors. Pray what was he? Rough. You talke of Little Davy, Cutting Dick, And divers such, but tush, this hath no fellow. Fors. Of what stature and yeares was he? Rough. Indeed I must confesse he was no giant, Nor above fifty, but he did bestirre him, Was here and there, and every where at once, That I was ne'er so put to't since the Midwife First wrapt my head in linnen. Let's to Besse. Ile tell her the whole project. Fors. Heres the house, wee'll enter if you please. Roug. Where be these Drawers, Rascals I should say? That will give no attendance. Enter Clem. Clem. Anon, anon sir, please you see a roome. What you here againe? Now we shall have such roaring. Rough. You sirrah call your Mistresse. Clem. Yes sir, I know it is my duty to call her Mistresse. Rough. See and the slave will stir. Clem. Yes I doe stir. Rough. Shal we have humors, sauce-box, you have eares Ile teach you prick-song. Clem. But you have now a wrong Sow by the eare. I will call her, Roughm. Doe sir, you had best. Clem. If you were twenty Roughmans, if you lug me by the eares againe, Ile draw. Roughm. Ha, what will you draw? Clem. The best wine in the house for your worship: and I would call her, but I can assure you she is eyther not stirring, or else not in case. Roughm. How not in case? Clem. I thinke she hath not her smocke on, for I thinke I saw it lye at her beds head. Rough. What, Drawers grow capritious? Clem. Help, help. Enter Besse Bridges. Besse. What uprore's this? shall we be never rid. From these disturbances? Rough. Why how now Besse? Is this your huswifry? When you are mine Ile have you rise as early as the Larke, Looke to the Bar your selfe: these lazy rascalls Will bring your state behinde hand. Clem. You lye sir? Roughm. How? lye? Clem. Yes sir at the Raven in the high-street, I was at your lodging this morning for a pottle pot. Roughm. You will about your businesse, must you heare Stand gaping and idle? Besse. You wrong me sir, And tyrannize too much over my servants. I will have no man touch them but my selfe. Clem. If I doe not put Rats-bane into his wine in stead of Suger, say I am no true Baker. Roughm. VVhat, rise at noone? A man may fight a tall fray in a morning, And one of your best friends too be hackt and mangled, And almost cut to peeces, and you fast Close in your bed, ne'er dreame on't. Besse. Fought you this day? Roughm. And ne'er was better put too't in my daies. Besse. I pray, how was't? Roughm. Thus: as I past yon fields: Enter the Kitchin-maid. Maid. I pray forsooth, what shall I reckon for the Iolle of Ling in the Port-cullis. Roughm. A pox upon your Iolles, you kitchin-stuffe, Goe scowre your skillets, pots, and dripping-pans, And interrupt not us. Maid. The Devill take your Oxe-heeles, you foule Cods-head, must you be kicking? Roughm. Minion dare you scould? Maid. Yes sir, and lay my ladle over your coxcombe. Besse. I doe not thinke that thou darst strike a man, That swaggerst thus ore women. Rough. How now Besse? Besse. Shall we be never quiet? Fors. You are too rude. Roughm. Now I professe all patience. Bess. Then proceede. Roughm. Rising up early, Minion whilst you slept, To crosse yon field, I had but newly parted With this my friend, but that I soone espide A gallant fellow, and most strongly arm'd. In the mid-field we met, and both being resolute, VVe justled for the wall. Besse. VVhy, did there stand a wall in the mid-field? Roughm. I meant strove for the way. Two such brave spirits meeting, straight both drew. Enter Clem. Clem. The Maid forsooth sent me to know whether you would have the shoulder of mutton roasted or sod. Roughm. A mischiefe on your shoulders. Cl. That's the way to make me never prove good porter Besse. You still heape wrongs on wrongs. Rough. I was in fury To thinke upon the violence of that fight, And could not stay my rage. Fors. Once more proceed. Roughm. Oh had you seene two tilting meteors justle In the mid Region, with like feare and fury We two encounter'd. Not Briarius Could with his hundred hands have strucke more thicke. Blowes came about my head, I tooke them still. Thrusts by my sides twixt body and my armes, Yet still I put them by. Besse. When they were past he put them by. Goe on. But in this fury what became of him? Ro. I thinke I paid him home, hee's soundly maul'd, I bosom'd him at every second thrust. Besse. Scap'd he with life? Rough. I, thats my feare: if he recover this, Ile never trust my sword more. Besse. Why fly you not if he be in such danger? Rough. Because a witch once told me I ne'er should dye for murder. Besse. I beleeve thee, But tell me pray, was not this gallant fellow, A pretty faire young youth about my yeares? Rough. Even thereabout. Clem. He was not fiftie then. Besse. Much of my stature? Rough. Much about your pitch, Clem. He was no giant then. Besse. And wore a suit like this? Rough. I halfe suspect. Besse. That gallant fellow, So wounded and so mangled, was my selfe, You base white-lyver'd slave, it was this shooe That thou stoopt to untie: untrust those points: And like a beastly coward lay along, Till I stridd over thee. Speake, was't not so? Rough. It cannot be deny'd. Besse. Hare-hearted fellow, Milk-sop, dost not blush? Give me that Rapier: I will make thee sweare, Thou shalt redeeme this scorne thou hast incurr'd, Or in this woman shape Ile cudgell thee, And beate thee through the streets. As I am Besse, I'll do't. Rough. Hold, hold; I sweare. Bes. Dare not to enter at my doore till then. Rough. Shame confounds me quite. Bess. That shame redeem: perhaps wee'l doe thee grace I love the valiant, but despise the base. Exit. Clem. VVill you be kickt sir? Rough. She hath wakend me, And kindled that dead fire of courage in me, VVhich all this while hath slept: To spare my flesh And wound my fame, what is't? I will not rest Till by some valiant deed I have made good All my disgraces past. Ile crosse the streete, And strike the next brave fellow that I meet. Fors. I am bound to see the end on't. Rough. Are you sir? Beates off Forset. Enter Mayor of Foy, an Alderman, and Servant. Mayor. Beleeve me sir, she beares her selfe so well, No man can justly blame her: and I wonder Being a single woman as she is, And living in an house of such resort, She is no more distasted. Alder. The best Gentlemen The Country yeelds, become her daily guests. Sure sir I thinke shee's rich. Mayor. Thus much I know, would I could buy her state VVere't for a brace of thousands. A shot. Ald. Twas said a ship is now put into harbour, Know whence she is. Serv. Ile bring newes from the key. Mayor. To tell you true sir, I could wish a match Betwixt her and mine owne and onely sonne, And stretch my purse too upon that condition. Ald. Please you Ile motion it. Enter the Servant. Serv. One of the ships is new come from the Islands, The greatest man of note's one Captaine Goodlack. It is but a small Vessell. Enter Goodlack and Sailors. Goodl. Ile meet you straight at th'VVind-mill. Not one word of my name. 1 Sail. VVe understand you. Mayor. Sir tis told us you came late from th'Islands! Goodl. I did so: Mayor. Pray sir the newes from thence. Goodl. The best is, that the Generall is in health, And Fiall won from th'Spaniards: but the Fleet By reason of so many dangerous tempests Extremely wether-beaten. You sir I take it, Are Mayor o'th towne. Mayor. I am the Kings Lieftenant. Goodl. I have some Letters of import from one A Gentleman of very good account, That dide late in the Islands, to a Maide That keepes a Taverne here. Mayor. Her name Besse Bridges? Goodl. The same. I was desir'd to make inquirie VVhat fame she beares, and what report shee's of. Now you sir being here chiefe Magistrate, Can best resolve me. Mayor. To our understanding, Shee's without staine or blemish well reputed, And by her modesty and faire demeanour, Hath won the love of all. Goodl. The worse for me. Alder. I can assure you many narrow eyes Have lookt on her and her condition, But those that with most envy have endevour'd T'entrap her, have return'd won by her vertues. Goodl. So all that I inquire of make report. I am glad to heare't. Sir I have now some businesse, And I of force must leave you. Mayor. I intreat you to sup with me to night. Goodl. Sir I may trouble you. Five hundred pound a yeare out of my way. Is there no flaw that I can tax her with, To forfeit this revenew? Is she such a Saint, None can missay her? why then I my selfe VVill undertake it. If in her demeanor I can but finde one blemish, staine or spot, It is five hundred pound a yeare well got. Exit. Enter Clem and the Sailors on the one side, at the other Roughman, who drawes upon them, and beates them off. Enter Besse, Clem, and the Sailors. Bes. But did he fight it bravely? Clem. I assure you mistresse most dissolutely: hee hath runne this Sailer three times through the body, and yet never toucht his skinne. Besse. How can that be? Clem. Through the body of his doublet I meant. Besse, How shame, base imputation, and disgrace Can make a coward valiant: Sirrah you Looke to the barre. Clem. Ile hold up my hand there presently. Bes. I understand, you came now from the Islands, 1 Sail. VVe did so. Bes. If you can tell me tydings of one Gentleman I shall require you largely. 1 Sailor. Of what name? Bess. One Spencer. 1 Sailor. VVe both saw and knew the man. Besse. Onely for that call for what wine you please. Pray tell me where you left him. 2 Sailor. In Fiall. Bes. VVas he in health? how did he fare? 2 Sail. Why well. Bess. For that good newes, spend, revell, and carouse, Your reckning's paid before-hand. I'me extaside, And my delights unbounded. 1 Sail. Did you love him? Bess. Next to my hopes in heaven. 1 Sail. Then change your mirth. Besse. VVhy, as I take it, you told me he was well, And shall I not rejoyce? 1 Sail. Hee's well in heaven, For Mistrisse, he is dead, Bess. Hah, dead! was't so you said? Th'ast giv? me, friend But one wound yet, speake but that word againe, And kill me out-right. 2 Sail. He lives not. Bess. And shall I? VVilt thou not breake heart? Are these my ribs wrought out of brasse or steele, Thou canst not craze their barres? 1 Sail. Mistris use patience, which conquers all despaire. Besse. You advise well: I did but jeast with sorrow: you may see I am now in gentle temper. 2 Sail. True, we see't. Bes. Pray take the best roome in the house, and there Call for what wine best tasts you: at my leasure Ile visit you my selfe. 1 Sail. Ile use your kindnesse. Exeunt. Besse. That it should be my fate. Poore poore sweet-hart I doe but thinke how thou becomst thy grave, In which would I lay by thee: what's my wealth To injoy't without my Spencer. I will now Study to die, that I may live with him. Enter Goodlack. Goodl. The further I inquire, the more I heare To my discomfort. If my discontinuance And change at Sea disguise me from her knowledge I shall have scope enough to prove her fully. This sadnesse argues she hath heard some newes Of my Friends death. Besse. It cannot sure be true That he is dead, Death could not be so envious To snatch him in his prime. I study to forget That ere was such a man. Goodl. If not impeach her, My purpose is to seeke to marry her. If she deny me, Ile conceale the VVill, Or at the least make her compound for halfe. Save you faire Gentlewoman. Bess. You are welcome sir. Goodl. I heare say there's a whore here that draws wine, I am sharp set, and newly come from sea, And I would see the trash. Bess. Sure you mistake sir. If you desire attendance and some wine I can command you both. VVhere be these boyes? Goodl. Are you the Mistresse? Besse. I command the house. Goodl. Of what birth are you, pra'y? Bess. A Tanners daughter. Goodl. VVhere borne? Besse. In Somersetshire. Goodl. A trade-falne Tanners daughter goe so brave: Oh you have trickes to compasse these gay cloaths. Besse. None sir, but what are honest. Goodl. VVhat's your name? Besse. Besse Bridges most men call me. Goodl. Y'are a whore. Besse. Sir, I will fetch you wine to wash your mouth, It is so foule, I feare't may fester else. There may be danger in't. Goodl. Not all this move her patience. Besse. Good sir, at this time I am scarce my selfe By reason of a great and weighty losse That troubles me: but I should know that Ring. Goodl. How, this, you baggage? It was never made To grace a strumpets finger. Besse. Pardon sir, I both must and will leave you. Exit. Goodl. Did not this well? This will sticke in my stomack I could repent my wrongs done to this maid: But Ile not leave her thus: if she still love him, Ile breake her heart-strings with some false report Of his unkindnesse. Enter Clem. Clem. You are welcome Gentleman: what wine will you drinke? Claret, Metheglin, or Muskadine, Cyder or Pyrrey, to make you merry, Aragoosa, or Peter-see-mee, Canary or Charnico? But by your nose sir you should love a cup of Malmsey: you shall have a cup of the best in Cornwaile. Goodl. Here's a brave drawer will quarrell with his wine. Clem. But if you preferre the Frenchman before the Spaniard, you shall have either here of the deepe red grape or the pallid white. You are a pretty tall Gentleman, you should love High-Country wine: none but Clarkes and Sextons love Graves wine. Or are you a maried man, Ile furnish you with bastard, white or browne, according to the complexion of your bed-fellow. Goodl. You rogue, how many yeares of your prentiship Have you spent in studying this set speech? Clem. The first line of my part was, Anon anon, sir: and the first question I answerd to, was logger-head, or blockhead, I know not whether. Goodl. Speake, wheres your Mistresse? Clem. Gone up to her chamber. Goodl. Set a pottle of Sacke in th'fire, and carry it into the next roome. Exit. Clem. Score a pottle of Sacke in the Crowne, and see at the barre for some rotten egges to burne it: we must have one tricke or other to vent away our bad commodities. Exit. Enter Besse with Spencers Picture. Besse. To dye, and not vouchsafe some few commends Before his death, was most unkindly done. This Picture is more courteous: 'twill not shrinke For twenty thousand kisses: no nor blush: Then thou shalt be my husband, and I vow Never to marry other. Enter Goodlacke. Goodl. Wheres this harlot? Besse. You are immodest sir to presse thus rudely Into my private chamber. Goodl. Pox of modesty When punks must have it mincing in their mouthes. And have I found thee? then shalt hence with me. Besse. Rob me not of the chiefest wealth I have: Search all my trunks, take the best Iewels there: Deprive me not that treasure, Ile redeeme it With plate, and all the little coyne I have, So I make keepe that still. Goodl. Thinkst thou that bribes Can make me leave my friends Will unperform'd? Besse. What was that Friend? Goodl. One Spencer, dead i'th Islands, Whose very last words uttered at his death Were these, If ever thou shalt come to Foy, Take thence my picture, and deface it quite: For let it not be said, my pourtrature Shall grace a strumpets chamber. Bess. Twas not so: You lye, you are a villaine: twas not so. Tis more then sinne thus to bely the dead: Hee knew if ever I would have transgrest, 'T had beene with him: he durst have sworne me chaste, And dyde in that beliefe. Good. Are you so briefe? Nay, Ile not trouble you: God b'oy you. Besse. Yet leave me still that Picture, and Ile sweare You are a Gentleman, and cannot lie. Goodl. I am inexorable. Besse. Are you a Christian, have you any name That ever good man gave you? 'Twas no Saint you were call'd after. Whats thy name? Goodl. My name is Captaine Thomas Goodâ Bess. I can see no good in thee, Race that syllable Out of thy name. Goodl. Goodlacke's my name. Besse. I cry you mercy sir: I now remember you, You were my Spencers friend, and I am sory, Because he lov'd you, I have beene so harsh: For whose sake, I intreat ere you take't hence, I may but take my leave on't. Goodl. You'l returne it? Besse. As I am chaste I will. Goodl. For once Ile trust you. Besse. Oh thou the perfect semblance of my Love, And all that's left of him, take one sweet kisse, As my last farewell. Thou resemblest him For whose sweet safety I was every morning Downe on my knees, and with the Larkes sweet tunes I did begin my prayers: and when sad sleepe Had charm'd all eyes, when none save the bright starres Were up and waking, I remembred thee, But all, all to no purpose. Goodl. Sure, most sure, this cannot be dissembled. Besse. To thee I have beene constant in thine absence, And when I look'd upon this painted peece Remembred thy last rules and principles: For thee I have given almes, visited prisons, To Gentlemen and passengers lent coyne, That if they ever had abilitie They might repay't to Spencer: yet for this, All this, and more, I cannot have so much As this poore table. G. I should question truth, if I should wrong this creature. Besse. I am resolv'd. See sir, this Picture I restore you backe, Which since it was his will you should take hence, I will not wrong the dead. Goodl. God be w'you. Besse. One word more. Spencer you say was so unkinde in death. Goodl. I tell you true. Besse. I doe intreat you even for goodnesse sake Since you were one that he intirely lov'd, If you some few dayes hence here me expir'd, You will mongst other good men, and poore people That haply may misse Besse, grace me so much As follow me to th'grave. This if you promise, You shall not be the least of all my friends Remembred in my will. Now fare you well. Goodl. Had I a heart of flint or adamant It would relent at this. My Mistris Besse, I have better tydings for you. Besse. You will restore my Picture? will you? Goodl. Yes, and more then that, This Ring from my friends finger sent to you, With infinite commends. Besse. You change my blood. Goodl. These writings are the evidence of Lands, Five hundred pound ayeare's bequeath'd to you, Of which I here possesse you: all is yours. Besse. This surplussage of love, hath made my losse That was but great before: now infinite. It may be compast: there's in this my purpose No impossibilitie. Goodl. What study you? Besse. Foure thousand pound besides this Legacie, In Iewels, gold, and silver I can make, And every man discharg'd. I am resolv'd To be a patterne to all Maides hereafter Of constancy in love. G. Sweet Mistris Besse, will you command my service, Is to succeed your Spencer in his Love, I would expose me wholly to your wishes. Besse. Alas my love sleepes with him in his grave, And cannot thence be wakend: yet for his sake I will impart a secret to your trust, Which, saving you, no mortall should partake. Goodl. Both for his love and yours, command my service. Besse. There's a prise Brought into Famouth Road, a good tight Vessell, The Bottome will but cost eight hundred pound, You shall have money: buy it. Goodl. To what end? Besse. That you shall know hereafter. Furnish her With all provision needfull: spare no cost: And joyne with you a ginge of lusty ladds, Such as will bravely man her: all the charge I will commit to you: and when shee's fitted, Captaine she is thine owne. Goodl. I sound it not. Besse. Spare me the rest. This voyage I intend, Though some may blame, all Lovers will commend. Exeunt. Explicit Actus tertius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus. Scena prima. After an Alarmne, Enter a Spanish Captaine, with Saylors, bringing in a Merchant, Spencer, and the Surgion prisoners. Spaniard. For Fialls losse, and spoile by th'English done, We are in part reveng'd. There's not a Vessell That beare upon her top S. Georges Crosse, But for that act shall suffer. Merchant. Insult not Spaniard, Nor be too proud, that thou by oddes of Ships, Provision, men, and powder mad'st us yeeld. Had you come one to one, or made assault With reasonable advantage, wee by this Had made the carkasse of your ship your graves, Low suncke to the Seas bottome. Span. Englishman, thy ship shall yeeld us pillage, These prisoners we will keepe in strongest Hold, To pay no other ransome then their lives. Spenc. Degenerate Spaniard, there's no noblesse in thee To threaten men unarm'd and miserable, Thou mightst as well tread ore a field of slaughter, And kill them ore, that are already slaine, And brag thy manhood. Span. Sirrah, what are you? Spen. Thy equall as I am a prisoner, But once to stay a better man then thou, A Gentleman in my Country. Span. Wert thou not so, we have strappadoes, bolts, And engines to the Maine-mast-fastened, Can make you gentle. Spenc. Spaniard doe thy worst, thou canst not act More tortures then my courage is able to endure. Span. These Englishmen Nothing can daunt them; Even in misery They'l not regard their masters. Spenc. Masters! Insulting bragging Thrasoes. Span. His sawcinesse wee'l punish 'bove the rest. About their censures we will next devise, Flourish And now towards Spaine with our brave English prise. Exeunt. Enter Besse, Mayor, Alderman, Clem. A table set out, and stooles. Besse. A Table and some stooles. Cl. I shal give you occasion to ease your tailes presently. Bes. Will't please you sit? Mayor. With all our hearts, and thanke you. Besse. Fetch me that parchment in my Closet window. Cl. The three sheep-skins with the wrong side outward Besse. That with the seale. Clem. I hope it is my Indenture, and now shee meanes to give me my time. Alder. And now you are alone, faire Mistresse Elzabeth I thinke it good to taste you with a motion. That no way can displease you. Besse. Pray speake on. Alder. 'T hath pleas'd here Master Mayor so far to look Into your faire demeanour, that he thinkes you A fit match for his Sonne. Enter Clem with the parchment. Clem. Here's the parchment, but if it bee the lease of your house, I can assure you 'tis out. Besse. The yeares are not expired. Clem. No, but it is out of your Closet. Besse. About your businesse. Cl. Here's even Susanna bewixt the two wicked elders. Ald. What thinke you Mistresse Elzabeth? Besse. Sir I thanke you. And how much I esteeme this goodnesse from you The trust I shall commit unto your charge Will truly witnes. Marry, gentle Sir!

The Legacies for Spencer thus to stand, To number all the poorest of his kin, And to bestow on them. Item toâ Besse. Enough: you see sir I am now too poore To bring a dowry with me fit for your sonne. Mayor. You want a president, you so abound In charitie and goodnesse. Besse. All my servants I leave at your discretions to dispose Not one but I have left some Legacie. What shall become of me, or what I purpose Spare further to enquire. Mayor. Wee'll take our leaves. And prove to you faithfull Executors. In this bequest. Alder. Let never such despaire, As dying rich, shall make the poore their heyre. Exit. Besse. Why what is all the wealth the world containes, Without my Spencer? Enter Roughman and Forset. Roughm. Wheres my sweet Besse? Shall I become a welcome suiter now? That I have chang'd my Copie? Besse. I joy to heare it. Ile finde imployment for you. Enter Goodlacke, Sailors, and Clem. Goodl. A gallant ship, and wondrous proudly trim'd, Well calkt, well tackled, every way prepar'd. Besse. Here then our mourning for a season end. Rough. Besse, shall strike that Captaine? say the word, Ile have him by the eares. Besse. Not for the world. Goodl. What saith that fellow? Besse. He desires your love, good Captain let him ha'it. Goodl. Then change a hand. Besse. Resolve me all. I am bound upon a voyage, Will you in this adventure take such part, As I my selfe shall doe? Rough. With my fayre Besse, to the worlds end. Besse. Then Captaine and Lieftenant both, joine hands, Such are your places now. Goodl. Wee two are friends. Bess. I next must sweare you two, with all your ginge True to some articles you must observe, Reserving to my selfe a prime command, Whilst I injoyne nothing unreasonable. Goodl. All this is granted. Bes. Then first, you said your ship was trim and gay, Ile have her pitcht all ore, no spot of white, No colour to be seene, no Saile but blacke, No Flag but sable. Goodl. Twill be ominous, and bode disaster fortune. Besse. Ile ha'it so. Goodl. Why then she shall be pitcht blacke as the devil, Besse. She shall be call'd The Negro, when you know My conceit, Captaine, you will thanke for't. Roug. But whither are we bound? Besse. Pardon me that. When wee are out at sea Ile tell you all. For mine owne wearing I have rich apparell, For man or woman as occasion serves. Clem. But Mistrisse, if you be going to sea, what shall become of me aland. Besse. Ile give thee thy full time. Clem. And shall I take time, when time is, and let my Mistresse slip away. No, it shall be seene that my teeth are as strong to grinde bisket as the best sailor of them all, and my stomacke as able to digest pouderd beefe and Poore-john. Shall I stay here to scoare a pudding in the Halfe-moone, and see my Mistresse at the Maine yard with her sailes up, and spread. No it shall be seene that I who have beene brought up to draw wine, will see what water the ship drawes, or Ile beray the Voyage. Besse. If thou hast so much courage, the Captaine shall accept thee. Clem. If I have so much courage? When did you see a blacke beard with a white lyvor, or a little fellow without a tall stomacke. I doubt not but to prove an honour to all the Drawers in Cornwall. Goodl. What now remaines? Fors. To make my selfe assotiate in this bold enterprise. Goodl. Most gladly sir. And now our number's full, what's to be done. Besse. First, at my charge Ile feast the towne of Foy, Then set the Cellers ope, that these my Mates May quaffe unto the health of our boone voyage, Our needfull things being once convay'd aboard, Then casting up our caps in signe of joy, Our purpose is to bid farewell to Foy. Hoboyes long. Enter Mullisheg. Bashaw Alcade, and Ioffer: with other Attendants. Mullish. Out of these bloody and intestine broiles Wee have at length attain'd a fort'nate peace, And now at last establisht in the Throne Of our great Ancestors, and raigne King Of Fesse and great Morocco. Alcade. Mighty Mullisheg, Pride of our age, and glory of the Moores, By whose victorious hand all Barbary Is conquer'd, aw'd, and swai'd: behold thy vassalls With loud applauses greet thy victory. shout. flourish. Mull. Vpon the slaughtered bodies of our foes, We mount our high Tribunall, and being sole VVithout competitor, we now have leasure To stablish lawes first for our Kingdomes safetie, The inriching of our publique Treasury, And last our state and pleasure: then give order That all such Christian Merchants as have traffique And freedome in our Country, that conceale The least part of our Custome due to us, Shall forfeit ship and goods. Ioff. There are appointed Vnto that purpose carefull officers. Mull. Those forfeitures must help to furnish up Th'exhausted treasure that our wars consum'd, Part of such profits as accrue that way VVe have already tasted. Alc. Tis most fit, Those Christians that reape profit: by our Land Should contribute unto so great a losse. Mull. Alcade, They shall. But what's the style of King VVithout his pleasure? Finde us concubines, The fayrest Christian Damsells you can hire, Or buy for gold: the loueliest of the Moores VVe can command, and Negroes every where: Italians, French, and Dutch, choise Turkish Girles Must fill our Alkedavy, the great Pallace, Where Mullisheg now daines to keepe his Court. Ioffer. Who else are worthy to be Libertines, But such as beare the Sword? Mull. Ioffer, Thou pleasest us. If Kings on earth be termed Demi-gods, Why should we not make here terrestriall heaven? VVe can, wee will, our God shall be our pleasure, For so our Mecan Prophet warrants us. And now the musicke of the Drums surcease, Wee'll learne to dance to the soft tunes of peace. Hoboyes. Enter Besse like a Sea-captaine, Goodlacke, Roughman, Forset, and Clem. Bess. Good morrow Captaine. Oh this last Sea-fight VVas gallantly perform'd. It did me good To see the Spanish Carveile vaile her top Vnto my Maiden Flag. VVhere ride we now? Goodl. Among the Islands. Bess. VVhat coast is this wee now descry from farre. Goodl. Yon Fort's call'd Fiall. Bess. Is that the place where Spencers body lies? Goodl. Yes, in yon Church hee's buried. Besse. Then know, to this place was my voyage bound To fetch the body of my Spencer thence. In his owne Country to erect a tombe, And lasting monument, where when I die In the same bed of earth my bones may lye. Then all that love me, arme and make for shore, Yours be the spoile, be mine, I crave no more. Rough. May that man dye derided and accurst That will not follow where a woman leades. Goodl. Roughman, you are too rash, and counsell ill, Have not the Spaniards fortifide the towne? In all our Ginge wee are but sixty five. Roughm. Come, Ile make one. Goodl. Attend me good Lieutenant, And sweet Besse, listen what I have devis'd, With ten tall Fellowes I have man'd our Boat, To see what stragling Spaniards they can take. And see where Forset is return'd with prisoners. Enter Forset with two Spaniards. Fors. These Spaniards we by breake of day surpris'd, As they were ready to take boat for Fishing. Goodl. Spaniards, upon your lives resolve us truly How strong's the Towne and Fort. Span. Since English Rawleigh wan and spoil'd it first, The Towne's reedifide, and Fort new built, And foure Field-peeces in the Block-house lye To keepe the Harbours mouth. Goodl. And what's one ship to these? Besse. Was there not in the time of their aboad A Gentleman call'd Spencer buryed there Within the Church, whom some report was slaine, Or perisht by a wound? Span. Indeed there was, And ore him rais'd a goodly monument, But when the English Navy were sail'd thence, And that the Spaniards did possesse the Towne, Because they held him for an Heretike, They straight remov'd his body from the Church. Bes. And would the tyrants be so uncharitable To wrong the dead? where did they then bestow him? Span. They buryed him ith fields. Besse. Oh still more cruell. Span. The man that ought the field, doubtfull his corne Would never prosper whilst an hereticks body Lay there, hee made petition to the Church To ha'it digd up and burnt, and so it was. Besse. What's he that loves me would perswade me live, Not rather leape ore hatches into th'Sea: Yet ere I die I hope to be reveng'd Vpon some Spaniards for my Spencers wrong. Rough. Let's first begin with these. Bess. 'Las these poore slaves! besides their pardond lives One give them money. And Spaniards where you come, Pray for Besse Bridges, and speake well o'th English. Span. We shall. Bess. Our mourning wee will turne into revenge, And since the Church hath censur'd so my Spencer, Bestow upon the Church some few cast Peeces, Command the Gunner do't. Goodl. And if he can to batter it to the earth. A Peece. Enter Clem falling for haste. Clem. A Saile, a Saile. Besse. From whence? Clem. A pox upon yon Gunner, could he not giue warning before he had shot? Rough. Why I prethee? Clem. Why? I was sent to the top-mast to watch, and there I fell fast asleepe. Bounce quoth the guns, downe tumbles Clem, and if by chance my feet had not hung in the tackles, you must have sent to England for a bone-setter, for my necke had beene in a pittifull taking, Rough. Thou toldst us of a Saile. Enter Sailer above. Sailor. Arme Gentlemen, a gallant ship of warre Makes with her full sailes this way: who it seemes Hath tooke a Barke of England. Besse. Which wee'll rescue. Or perish in th'adventure. You have sworne That howsoere we conquer or miscary Not to reveale my sex. All. Wee have. Bess. Then for your Countries honor, my revenge, For your owne fame, and hope of golden spoile, Stand bravely to't. The manage of the fight We leaue to you. Go. Then now up with your fights, &amp; let your ensignes Blest with S. Georges Crosse, play with the windes. Faire Besse, keepe you your cabin. Besse. Captaine you wrong me, I will face the fight, And where the bullets sing loudst 'bout mine eares, There shall you finde me chearing up my men. Rough. This wench would of a coward make an Hercules. Besse. Trumpets a charge, and with your whistles shrill Sound boatswaynes an alarum to your mates. With musicke cheare up their astonisht soules, The whilst the thundring Ordnance beare the Base. Goodl. To fight against the Spaniards we desire, Alarme Trumpets. Alarme. Rough. Gunners straight give fire. Shot. Enter Goodlacke hurt. Besse, Roughman, Forset, Clem. Goodl. I am shot and can no longer man the Decke, Yet let not my wound daunt your courage mates. Besse. For every drop of blood that thou hast shed, Ile have a Spaniards life. Advance your Targets, And now cry all, Boord, boord, amaine for England. Alarme. Enter with victory Besse, Roughman, Forset, Clem, &amp;c. The Spaniards Prisoners. Besse. How is it with the Captaine? Rough. Nothing dangerous, But being shot ith' thigh hee keepes his Cabin, And cannot rise to greet your victory. Besse. He stood it bravely out whilst he could stand. Clem. But for these Spaniards, now you Don Diegoes, You that made Paules to stinke. Roughm. Before we further censure them, let's know What English prisoners they have here aboord. Span. You may command them all. We that were now Lords ouer them, Fortune hath made your slaves, Release our prisoners. Besse. Had my captaine dide Not one proud Spaniard had escap'd with life, Your ship is forfeit to us, and your goods. So live. Give him his long Boate: him and his Set safe ashore; and pray for English Besse. Sp. I know not whom you meane, but bee't your Queene Famous Elizabeth, I shall report She and her subjects both are mercifull. Exeunt. Enter Roughman, with the Merchant and Spencer. Bess. Whence are you sir? and whither were you bound? Merch. I am a London bound for Barbary, But by this Spanish Man-of-warre surpris'd, Pillag'd and captiv'd. Besse. We much pitty you, What losse you have sustain'd, this Spanish prey Shall make good to you to the utmost farthing. Merc. Our lives, and all our fortunes whatsoever Are wholly at your service. Besse. These Gentlemen have been dejected long, Let me peruse them all, and give them money To drinke our health, and pray forget not Sirs, To pray forâHold, support me, or I faint. Roughm. What sudden unexpected extasie Disturbs your conquest. Besse. Interrupt me not, But give me way for Heavens sake. Spencer. I have seene a face ere now like that yong Gentleman, But not remember where. Besse. But he was slaine, Lay buried in yon Church, and thence remov'd, Denyde all Christian rights, and like an Infidell Confinde unto the fields, and thence digd up, His body after death had martyrdome: All these assure me tis his shadow dogs me, For some most just revenge thus farre to Sea. Is it because the Spaniards scap'd with life, That were to thee so cruell after death Thou hauntst me thus? Sweet ghost thy rage forbeare, I will revenge thee on the next we seaze. I am amaz'd, this sight Ile not endure. Sleepe, sleepe, faire ghost, for thy revenge is sure. Roug. Forset, convey the owner to his cabin. Spencer. I pray sir what young Gentleman is that? Rough. Hee's both the owner of the ship and goods, That for some reasons hath his name conceal'd. Spencer. Me thinke he lookes like Besse, for in his eyes Lives the first love that did my heart surprise. Roughm. Come Gentlemen, first make your losses good Out of this Spanish prize. Let's then divide Both severall wayes, and heavens be our guide. Merc. We towards Mamorrah. Roughm. We where the Fates doe please, Till we have tract a wildernesse of Seas. Florish. Enter Chorus. Our Stage so lamely can expresse a Sea, That we are forst by Chorus to discourse What should have beene in action. Now imagine Her passion ore, and Goodlacke well recoverd, Who had he not been wounded and seene Spencer, Had sure descride him. Much prise they have tane, The French and Dutch she spares, onely makes spoile Of the rich Spaniard, and the barbarous Turke. And now her fame growes great in all these seas. Suppose her rich, and forst for want of water To put into Mamorrah in Barbary, Where wearied with the habit of a man, She was discoverd by the Moores aboord, Which told it to the amorous King of Fesse, That ne'er before had English Lady seene. He sends for her on shore, how he receives her, How she and Spencer meet, must next succeed. Sit patient then, when these are fully told, Some may hap say, I, there's a Girle worth gold. Exeunt.

We will have banquets, revels, and what not To entertaine this stranger. Hoboyes. Enter Besse Bridges vail'd, Goodlack, Roughman, Forset, and Moores. A goodly presence! why's that beauty vail'd?

Captaine, let me thus Imbrace thee in my armes. Load him with gold For this great favour. Bess. Captaine, touch it not. Know King of Fesse my followers want no gold, I onely came to see thee for my pleasure, And shew thee, what these say thou never saw'st, A woman borne in England. Mull.

Mighty Prince, If you desire to see me beat my brest, Poure forth a river of increasing teares, Then you may urge me to that sad discourse. Mull. Not for Mamorrahs wealth, nor all the gold Coyn'd in rich Barbary. Nay sweet arise, And aske of me be'it halfe this kingdomes treasure, And thou art Lady on't. Besse. If I shall aske, 'tmust be, you will not give. Our country breedes no beggers, for our hearts Are of more noble temper. Mull. Sweet, your name? Besse. Elizabeth. Mull. There's vertue in that name. The Virgin Queene so famous through the world, The mighty Empresse of the maiden-Ile, Whose predecessors have ore-runne great France, Whose powerfull hand doth still support the Dutch, And keepes the potent King of Spaine in awe, Is not she titled so?
