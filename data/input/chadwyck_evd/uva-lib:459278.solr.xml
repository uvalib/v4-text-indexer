      <field name="fulltext">Thersites commeth in fyrste havinge a clubbe uppon his necke [Thersites] Have in a ruffler foorth of the greke lande Called Thersites if ye wyll me knowe. Abacke, geve me roume! in my way do ye not stand, For if ye do I wyll soone laye you lowe. In Homere of my actes ye have red I trow: Neyther Agamemnon nor Ulysses I spared to checkeâ They coulde not bringe me to be at theyr becke. Of late frome the sege of Troye I retourned Where all my harnes excepte this clubbe I lost, In an olde house there it was quyte burned Whyle I was preparinge vytayles for the hoste. I must nedes get me newe what so ever it cost. I wyll go seke adventures for I can not be ydle; I wyll hamper some of the knaves in a brydle. It greveth me to heare howe the knaves do bragge But, by supreme Jupiter, when I am harnessed well I shall make the dasters to renne in to a bagge To hyde them fro me as from the devyll of hell. I doubte not but hereafter of me ye shall heare tell Howe I have made the knaves for to play cowch quaile. But nowe to the shop of Mulciber to go I wyll not faile. Mulciber must have a shop made in the place and Thersites cometh before it sayinge a loude: Mulciber, whom the poetes doth call the god of fyer, Smith unto Jupiter kinge over all, Come foorth! Of thy office I the desyre, And graunte me my petiction; I aske a thinge but small. I wyl none of thy lightning, that thou art wont to make For the goddes supernall for yre when they do shake, With whiche they thruste the gyauntes downe to hell That were at a convention heaven to bye and sell; But I woulde have some helpe of Lemnos and Ilva That of theyr stele, by thy crafte, condatur mihi galea. Mulciber What, felowe Thersites, do ye speake latyn nowe? Nay, then farewell. I make God a vowe, I do not you understandeâno latyn is in my palet. And then he must do as he wolde go awaye. Thersites I say abyde, good Mulciber. I praye [thee] make me a sallet. Mulciber Why, Thersites, hast thou anye wytte in thy head? Woldest thou have a sallet nowe, all the herbes are dead? Besyde that it is not mete for a smyth To gether herbes and sallettes to medle with. Go get the to my lover Venus; She hath sallettes ynough for all us. I eate none suche sallettes for now I waxe olde And for my stomacke they are verye coulde. Thersites Nowe I praye to Jupiter that thou dye a cuckolde. I meane a sallet with whiche men do fyght. Mulciber It is a small tastinge of a mannes mighte That he shoulde for any matter Fyght with a fewe herbes in a platterâ No greate laude shoulde folowe that victorye. Thersites Goddes passion, Mulciber! where is thy wit and memory? I wolde have a sallet made of stele. Mulciber Whye, syr, in youre stomacke longe you shall it fele, For stele is harde for to digest. Thersites Mans bones and sydes, hee is worse then a beest! I wolde have a sallet to were on my hed Whiche under my chyn with a thonge red Buckeled shall be. Doest thou yet parceyve me? Mulciber Your mynde now I se. Why thou pevysshe ladde Arte thou almost madde Or well in thy wytte? Gette the a wallette! Wolde thou have a sallette? What woldest thou do with it? Thersites I pray the, good Mulciber, make no mo bones But let me have a sallet made at ones. Mulciber I must do somewhat for this knave. What maner of sallet, syr, woulde ye have? Thersites I wold have such a one that nother might nor mayne Shoulde perse it thorowe or parte it in twayne, Whiche nother gonstone nor sharpe speare Shoulde be able other to hurte or teare. I woulde have it also for to save my heade; Yf Jupiter him selfe woulde have me dead And if he in a fume woulde cast at me his fire This sallet I woulde have to kepe me from his yre. Mulciber I perceave youre mynde. Ye shall fynde me kynde. I wyll for you prepare. And then he goeth in to his shop and maketh a sallet for hym; at the laste he sayth: Here, Thersites, do this sallet weare And on thy head it beare And none shall worke the care. Then Mulciber goeth into his shop untyll he is called agayne. Thersites Now woulde I not feare with anye bull to fyghte Or with a raumpinge lyon nother by daye nor nyghte. O what greate strength is in my body so lusty Whiche for lacke of exercise is nowe almost rustye! Hercules in comparison to me was but a boye When the bandogge Cerberus from hell he bare awaye, When he kylled the lyons, hydra, and the bere so wylde. Compare him to me and he was but a chylde. Why, Sampson, I saye, hast thou no more wytte? Woldest thou be as strong as I? Come suck they mothers tytte! Wene you that David, that lyttle elvyshe boye, Should with his slinge have take my life awaye? Nay ywys, Golyath, for all his fyve stones I woulde have quashed his little boysshe bones. O howe it woulde do my harte muche good To se some of the giauntes before Noes floud! I woulde make the knaves to crye âcrekeâ, Or elles with my clubbe their braynes I wyll breake. But, Mulciber, yet I have not with the do; My heade is armed, my necke I woulde have to, And also my shoulders with some good habergyn, That the devyll if he shote at me coulde not enter in. For I am determined greate battayle to make, Excepte my fumishenes by some meanes may aslake. Mulciber Bokell on this habergyn as fast as thou canne And feare for the metinge of nother beast nor manne. Yf it were possible for one too shote an oke, This habergyn wyll defende thee frome the stroke; Let them throwe mylstones at the as thick as haile, Yet the to kyll they shall their purpose faile; Yf Malverne hylles shoulde on thy shoulders light, They shall not hurte the nor suppresse thy mighte; Yf Bevis of Hampton, Colburne and Guy Will the assaye, set not by them a flye; To be briefe: this habergyn shall the save Bothe by lande and water. Nowe playe the lustye knave. Then he goeth in to his shoppe againe. Thersites When I consider my shoulders that so brode be, When the other partes of my bodye I do beholde, I verely thynke that none in chrystente With me to medele dare be so bolde. Now have at [thee], lyons on Cotsolde! I wyll neyther spare for heate nor for colde. Where art thou, king Arthur, and the knightes of the rounde table? Come brynge forth your horses out of the stable! Lo with me to mete they be not able. By the masse, they had rather were a bable! Where arte thou, Gawyn the curtesse, and Cay the crabed? Here be a couple of knightes cowardishe and scabbed. Appere in thy likenesse, Syr Libeus Disconius, Yf thou wilt have my clubbe lyghte on thy hedibus. Lo ye maye see he beareth not the face With me to trye a blowe in thys place. Howe, syrray? Approche, syr Launcelot de Lake, What, renne ye awaie and for feare quake? Nowe he that did the a knight make Thought never that thou any battaile shouldest take. Yf thou wilt not come thy self, some other of thy felowes send! To battaile I provoke them; them selfe let them defende! Lo! for all the good that ever they se They wyll not ones set hande to fight with me. O, good lorde, howe brode is my brest And stronge with all, for hole is my chest. He that should medle with me shall have shrewde rest. Beholde you my handes, my legges, and my feete! Every parte is stronge, proportionable, and mete. Thinke you that I am not feared in felde and strete? Yes, yes, God wote! they geve me the wall Or elles with my clubbe I make them to fall. âBacke, knaves!â I saye to themâthen for feare they quake And take me then to the taverne and good chere me make. The proctoure and his men I made to renne their waies And some wente to hide them in Broken Heys. I tell you, at a woorde, I set not a torde By none of them al. Early and late I wyll walke And London stretes stalke Spyte of them greate and small. For I thinke verely That none, in heaven so hye Nor yet in hell so lowe, Whyle I have this clubbe in my hande, Can be able me to withstande Or me to overthrowe. But, Mulciber, yet I must the desyre To make me briggen yrons for myne armes And then I will love the as mine owne syre, For withoute them I can not be safe frome all harmes. Those once had, I will not sette a strawe By all the worlde for then I wyll by awe Have all my mynde or elles, by the holye roode, I wyl make them thinke the devyll caryeth them to the wood. Yf no man wyll with me battayle take A vyage to hell quickely I wyll make And there I wyll bete the devyll and his dame And bringe the soules awaye, I fullye entende the same. After that in hell I have ruffled so, [Streyghte] to olde purgatorye wyll I go. I wyll cleane that so purge rounde aboute That we shall nede no pardons to helpe them oute. Yf I have not fyghte ynoughe this wayes I wyll clymbe to heaven and fet awaye Peters kayesâ I wyll kepe them my selfe and let in a great route. What shoulde suche a fysher kepe good felowes out? Mulciber Have here Thersites briggen yrons bright And feare thou no man manly to fyghte; Thoughe he be stronger then Hercules or Sampson, Be thou prest and bolde to set him upon. Nother Amazon nor Xerxes with their hole rable The to assayle shall fynde it profytable. I warrante the they wyll fle fro thy face As doth an hare from the dogges in a chase. Would not thy blacke and rustye grym berde Nowe thou art so armed make anye man aferde? Surely if Jupiter dyd see the in this gere He woulde renne awaye and hyde hym for feare. He wold thinke that Typhoeus the gyaunt were alive And his brother Enceladus agayn with him to strive. If that Mars, of battell the god stoute and bold, In this aray shoulde chaunce the to beholde, He would yelde up his sworde unto the And god of battayle (he would say) thou shouldest be. Now fare thou wel; go the world through And seke adventures; thou arte man good ynough. Thersites Mulciber, whyle the starres shal shyne in the sky And Phaetons horses with the sonnes charret shall fly, Whyle the mornynge shall go before none And cause the darkennesse to vanysshe away soone, Whyle that the cat shall love well mylke, And whyle that women shal love to go in sylke, Whyle beggers have lyce And cockneys are nyce, Whyle pardoners can lye Marchauntes can by And chyldren crye, Whyle all these laste and more Whiche I kepe in store, I do me faythfully bynde Thy kyndnes to beare in mynde. But yet, Mulciber, one thinge I aske more: Haste thou ever a sworde now in store? I would have suche a one that would cut stones And pare a great oke down at once; That were a sworde, lo, even for the nones. Mulciber Truely I have suche a one in my shoppe That wil pare yron as it were a rope. Haveâhere it isâgyrde it to thy syde. Now fare thou well; Jupiter be thy guyde. Thersites Gramercye, Mulciber, wyth my hole harte; Geve me thy hande and let us departe. Mulciber goeth in to hys shoppe againe and Thersites saith foorth: Nowe I go hence and put my selfe in prease; I wyll seeke adventures, yea, and that I wyll not cease. If there be any present here thys nyghte That wyll take upon them with me to fighte, Let them come quickly and the battayle shall be pyghte. Where is Cacus? that knave not worthe a grote, That was wont to blowe cloudes oute of his throte, Which stale Hercules kine and hyd them in his cave. Come hether Cacus, thou lubber and false knave, I wyll teache all wretches by the to beware. If thou come hether I trappe the in a snare; Thou shalt have knocked breade and yll fare. How say you, good godfather, that loke so stale, Ye seeme a man to be borne in the valeâ Dare ye adventure wyth me a stripe or two? Go coward! Go hide the as thou wast wonte to do. What a sorte of dasterdes have we here? None of you to battaile with me dare appeare. What saie you, hart of gold, of countenaunce so demure? Will you fighte with me? No, I am righte sure. Fye! blusshe not, woman, I wyll do you no harme Excepte I had you soner to kepe my backe warme. Alas, lyttle pums, why are ye so sore afrayd? I praye you, shew how longe it is sence ye were a mayd. Tell me in myne eare. Syrs, she hathe me tolde That gone was her mydenhead at thrustene yeare olde. Byr ladye! she was lothe to kepe it to longe. âAnd I were a mayde agayneâ nowe maye be here songe. Do after my counsel, of maydens the hoole bevye, Quickly red your maydenhed for they are vengeaunce hevy. Well, let all go. Whye, wyll none come in With me to fyghte that I maye pare his skyn? The Mater commeth in Mater What saye you my sonne, wyl ye fyght? God it defende! For what cause to warre do you nowe pretende? Wyll ye committe to battayles daungerous Youre lyfe that is to me so precious? Thersites I wyll go, I wyll go! Stoppe not my waye. Holde me not, good mother, I hartely you pray. If there be any lyons or other wylde beest That wyll not suffer the husband man in rest, I wyll go seeche them and byd them to a feest. They shall abye bytterlye the comminge of suche a gest. I wyll searche for them bothe in busshe and shrubbe And laye on a lode with this lustye clubbe. Mater O, my swete sonne, I am thy mother; Wylt thou kyll me and thou hast none other? Thersites No, mother, no. I am not of suche iniquitye That I wyll defyle my handes upon the. But be contente, mother, for I wyll not rest Tyll I have foughte with some man or wylde beast. [Mater] Truely, my sonne, yf that ye take thys way, Thys shall be the conclusionâmarke what I shall say: Other I wyll drowne my selfe for sorowe And fede fyshes with my body before to morowe, Or wyth a sharpe swerde surely I wyll me kyll. Nowe thou mayst save me if it be thy wyll. I wyll also cut my pappes awaye That gave the sucke so manye a daye And so in all the worlde it shall be knowen That by my owne sonne I was overthrowen. Therefore, if my lyfe be to the pleasaunte, That whiche I desyre, good sonne, do me graunte. Thersites Mother thou spendest thy winde but in wast; The goddes of battayle hyr fury on me hath cast. I am fullye fyxed battayle for to taste. O, how many to deth I shall dryve in haste! I wyll ruffle this clubbe aboute my hedde Or els I pray god I never dye in my bedde. There shall never a stroke be stroken with my hande But they shall thynke [that] Jupiter doth thonder in the land. Mater My owne swete sonne, I, knelynge on my knee And bothe my handes holdinge up to the, Desyre the to ceasse and no battayle make. Call to the pacience and better wayes take. Thersites Tusshe, mother, I am deafe; I wyll the not heare. No, no! Yf Jupiter here him selfe nowe were And all the goddes and Juno his wife And lovinge Minerva that abhorreth all stryfe, Yf all these, I saye, would desyre me to be content, They dyd theyr wynde but in vaine spente. I wyll have battayle in Wayles or in Kente And some of the knaves I wyll all to rent. Where is the valiaunt knighte, syr Isenbrase? Appere, syr, I praye you. Dare ye not shewe your face? Where is Robin John and Little Hode? Approche hyther quickely if ye thinke it good. I wyll teache suche outlawes, wyth Chrystes curses, How they take hereafter awaye abbottes purses. Whye, wyll no adventure appeare in thys place? Where is Hercules with his greate mase? Where is Busyris that fed hys horses, Full lyke a tyraunte, with dead mens corses? Come any of you bothe And I make an othe That yer I eate anye breade I wyll dryve a wayne, Ye for neede twayne, Betwene your bodye and your heade. Thus passeth my braynes. Wyll none take the paynes To trye wyth me a blowe? O what a fellowe am I Whome everye man dothe flye That dothe me but once knowe. Mater Sonne all do you feare That be presente here; They wyll not wyth you fyghte. You, as you be worthye, Have nowe the victorye Wythoute tastynge of youre myghte. Here is none I trowe That profereth you a bloweâ Man, woman nor chylde. Do not set your mynde To fyghte with the wynde; Be not so madde nor wylde. Thersites I saye aryse who so ever wyll fighte; I am to battayle here readye dyghte. Come hyther other swayne or knyghte; Let me see who dare presente him to my syghte. Here with my clubbe readye I stande, Yf anye wyll come to take them in hand. Mater There is no hope left in my brest To bring my sonne unto better rest. He wyll do nothinge at my request; He regardeth me no more then a best. I see no remedye but styll I wyll praye To God my sonne to gyde in his waye That he maye have a prasperous tournynge And to bee save at his returnynge. Sonne, God above graunte thys my oration That when in battaile thou shalt have concertacion With your ennemies other fare or nere, No wounde in them nor in you may appere So that ye nother kyll nor be kylled. Thersites Mother, thy peticion I praye God be fulfylled For then no knaves bloude shall be spilled. [Aside] Felowes, kepe my counsell: by the masse, I doo but crakeâ I wyll be gentyll enoughe and no busenesse make. But yet I wyll make her beleve that I am a man. Thincke you that I wyll fight? No, no, but wyth the can, Excepte I finde my enemye on thys wyse That he be aslepe or els can not aryse. Yf his armes and his fete be not fast bounde, I wyll not profer a stripe for a thousande pound. Fare well mother and tarrye here no longer, For after proves of chivalry I do both thyrste and honger; I wyll beate the knaves as flatte as a conger. Then the mother goeth in the place which is prepareth for her. What! how long shal I tary? Be your hartes in your hose? Will there none of you in battayl me appose? Come prove me! Whye stande you so in doubte? Have you any wylde bloude that ye would have let oute? Alacke that a mans strengthe can not be [knowen] Because that he lacketh ennemies to be [overthrowen]. Here a snaile muste appere unto him and hee muste loke fearefully uppon the snaile, saienge: But what a monster do I see nowe Comminge hetherwarde with an armed browe? What is it? Ah, it is a sowe! No, by Gods body, it is but a grestle And on the backe it hath never a brystle. It is not a cowâah there I fayle For then it should have a long tayle. What the devyll! I was blyndeâit is but a snayle. I was never so afrayde in east nor in south; My harte at the fyrste syght was at my mouth. Mary, syr, fy, fy, fy! I do sweate for feareâ I thoughte I had craked but to tymely here. Hens thou beest and plucke in thy hornes Or I sweare, by him that crowned was with thornes, I will make [thee] drincke worse than good ale in the cornes. Haste thou nothynge elles to doo But come wyth hornes and face me so? Howe, how, my servauntes, get you shelde and spere And let us werye and kyll thys monster here. Here Miles cometh in. Miles Is not thys a worthye knyghte That wyth a snayle dareth not fight Excepte he have hys servauntes ayde? Is this the chaumpyon that maketh al men afraid? I am a pore souldiour come of late from Calice; I trust, or I go, to debate some of his malyce. I wyll tarrye my tyme tell I do see Betwixt hym and the snayle what the ende wyll be. Thersites Whye ye horeson knavys, regard ye not my callinge? Whye do ye not come and wyth you weapons brynge? Why, shall this monster so escape kyllinge? No, that he shal not and God be wyllinge. Miles I promyse you thys is as worthye a knyghte As ever shall brede oute of a bottell byte. I thinke he be Dares, of whom Virgyll doth write, That woulde not let Entellus alone But ever provoked and ever called on. But yet at the last he tooke a fall And so within a whyle, I trowe, I make [thee] shall. Thersites By Gods passion, knaves, if I come I wyll you fetter! Regarde ye my callinge and cryinge no better? Why, horesons, I saye! Wyll ye not come? By the masse! the knaves be all from home. They had better have fette me an errande at Rome. Miles By my trothe I thynke that very skante This lubber dare adventure to fighte with an ant. Thersites Well, seinge my servauntes come to me will not I must take hede that this monster me spyll not; I wyll joparde with it a joynte And, other with my clubbe or my sweardes poynte, I wyll reche it suche woundes As I woulde not have for [forty thousand] poundes. Plucke in thy hornes thou unhappy beast. What! facest thou me? Wilte not thou be in reste? Why! wylte not thou thy hornes in holde? Thinkest thou that I am a cockolde? Goddes armes! the monster cometh towarde me styll; Excepte I fyghte manfully, it wyll me surely kyll. Then he must fyghte against the snayle with his club. Miles O Jupiter! Lorde, doest thou not see and heare How he feareth the snayle as it were a bere? Thersites Well with my clubbe I have had good lucke; Nowe with my sworde have at the a plucke! And he must cast his club awaye I wyll make the or I go for to ducke And thou were as tale a man as Frier Tucke. I saye yet agayne thy hornes in drawe Or elles I wyll make the to have woundes rawe! Arte not thou aferde To have thy bearde Pared with my swearde? Here he must fighte then with his sworde against the snayle and the snayle draweth her hornes in. Ah well, nowe no more! Thou mightest have done so before. I layed at it so sore That it thoughte it shoulde have be lore. And it had not drawen in his hornes againe Surelye I woulde the monster have slaine. But now farewell, I wyll worke the no more payne. Nowe my fume is paste And dothe no longer laste That I did to the monster cast. Now in other countreis both farre and neare Mo dedes of chyvalrye I wyll go inquere. Miles Thou nedes not seke any further for redy I am here; I wyll debate anone I trowe thy bragginge chere. Thersites Nowe where is any mo that wyll me assayle? I wyll turne him and tosse him bothe toppe and tayle Yf he be stronger then Sampson was, Who with his bare handes kylde lyons apas. Miles What nedeth this booste? I am here at hande That with [thee] will fighte. Kepe [thy] heade and stande! Surelye for al thy hye wordes I wyll not feare To assaye the a towche tyll some bloude apeare. I wyll geve the somewhat for the gifte of a newe yeare. And he begynth to fight with him but Thersites must ren awaye and hyde hym behynde hys mother backe sayinge: Thersites O mother, mother, I praye the me hyde! Throwe some thinge over me and cover me every syde! Mater O my sonne, what thynge eldyth the? Thersites Mother, a thousande horsemen do persecute me. Mater Marye, sonne, then it was time to flye; I blame the not then thoughe afrayde thou be. A deadlye wounde thou mightest there sone catche. One against so manye is no indyfferente matche. Thersites No, mother, but if they had bene but ten to one I woulde not have avoyded but set them uppon, But seinge they be so many I ran awaye. Hyde me, mother, hyde me, I hartely the pray! For if they come hyther and here me fynde To their horses tayles they wyll me bynde And after that fasshyon hall me and kyll me; And thoughe I were never so bolde and stoute, To fyghte againste so manye I shoulde stande in doubte. Miles Thou that doest seke giauntes to conquere Come foorth if thou dare and in this place appere! Fy, for shame! doest thou so sone take flighte? Come forth and shewe somewhat of thy myghte! Thersites Hyde me, mother, hyde me, and never worde saye! Miles Thou, olde trotte, seyst thou any man come thys waye Well armed and weaponed and readye to fighte? Mater No forsothe, maister, there came none in my sight. Miles He dyd avoyde in tyme for withoute doubtes I woulde have set on his backe some clowtes. Yf I may take him I wyll make all slowches To beware by him that they come not in my clowches. Then he goeth oute and the Mother saith: Mater Come foorth, my sonne, youre enemy is gone; Be not afrayed for hurte thou canst have none. Then he loketh aboute if he be gone or not at the last he sayth: Thersites Ywys thou didest wisely, who so ever thou be, To tarrye no longer to fighte with me, For with my clubbe I woulde have broken thy skull, Yf thou were as bigge as Hercules bull. Why, thou cowardely knave, no stronger then a ducke, Darest thou trye maystries with me a plucke, Whiche fere nother giauntes nor Jupiters fire bolte Nor Beelzebub the mayster devyll as ragged as a colte? I woulde thou wouldest come hyther ones againe; I thincke thou haddest rather alyve to be flayne. Come againe and I sweare by my mothers wombe I wyll pull the in peeces no more then my thombe And thy braines abrode I wyll so scatter That all knaves shall feare against me to clatter. Then cometh in Telemachus bringinge a letter from his father Ulisses and Thersites saieth: What, little Telemachus, What makest thou here amonge us? Telemachus Syr my father, Ulysses, doth hym commende To you most hartely and here he hath you sende Of hys mynde a letter Whiche shewe you better Every thynge shall Then I can make rehersall. Here he must delyver hym the letter. Thersites Lo frendes ye maye see What great men wryte to mee: Here he must redde the letter. âAs entyrely as harte can thyncke Or scryvener can wryte with yncke, I sende you lovynge gretynge, Thersytes, myne owne swetynge. I am very sorye When I cast in memory The great unkyndnes And also the blyndnes That hath be in my brest Agaynst you ever prest; I have be prompt and dylygent Ever to make you shent, To appale your good name, And to mynysshe your fame; In that I was to blame. But well al this is gone And remedy there is none But onely repentaunce Of all my olde grevaunce With whiche I dyd you moleste And gave you sorye reast; The cause was thereof truely Nothinge but verye envye. Wherefore nowe, gentyll esquier, Forgeve me I you desyre And helpe, I you beseche, Telemachus to a leche, That hym maye wyselye charme From the wormes that do hym harme. In that ye maye do me pleasure, For he is my chyefe treasure. I have hearde menne say, That come by the way, That better charmer is no other Then is youre owne deare mother. I praye you of her obtayne To charme away his paine. Fare ye well and come to my house To dryncke wyne and eate a peece of sowse And we wyll have minstrelsy That shall pype âHankyn Bobyâ. My wyfe Penelobe Doth grete you well by me: Wrytinge at my house on Candelmasse daye Mydsomer moneth the Calendars of Maye By me Ulisse[s], beynge verye gladde That the victorye of late of the monster ye hadde.â âAh syrrayeâ quod he! How saye you frendes all? Ulisses is glad for my favoure to call. Well, thoughe we ofte have swerved And he small love deserved, Yet I am well contente Seinge he dothe repente To let olde matters go And to take him no more so As I have do hyther to For my mortall fo. Come go with me Telemachus; I wyll the bringe Unto my mother to have her cherminge. I doubte not but by that tyme that she hathe done, Thou shalte be the better seven yeares agone. Then Thersytes goeth to his mother sayinge Mother, Christe thee save and see, Ulysses hathe sende his sonne to thee That thou shouldest hym charme From the wormes that hym harme. Mater Sonne, ye be wise kepe ye warme. Whye shoulde I for Ulysses doo, That never was kynde us to? He was readye in warre Ever the, sonne, to marre. Then had bene all my joye Exiled cleane awaye. Thersites Wel, mother, all that is past; Wroth maye not alwaye laste, And seinge we be mortall all Let not our wroth be immortall. Mater Charme that charme wyll; he shal not be charmed of me. Thersites Charme! or, by the masse, with my club I wil charme the! Mater Why, sonne, arte thou so wicked to beate thy mother? Thersites Ye, that I wyll, by goddes deare brother! Charme, olde witche, in the devils name Or I wyll sende the to him to be his dame! Mater Alas, what a sonne have I That thus dothe order me spitefullye! Cursed be the time that ever I hym fedde; I woulde in my bely he had be deade. Thersites Cursest thou olde hore? Blesse me againe Or I wyll blesse the that shall be to thy payne! Then he must take hyr by the armes and she crieth oute as foloweth: Mater He will kyll me! He wyll spyll me! He wyll brose me! He wyll lose me! He wyll pricke me! He wyll stycke me! Thersites. The devyll stycke the, olde wytherde witch, For I wyll sticke nother the nor none suche. But come [off]! geve me thy blessinge againe. I saye, let me have it or elles certayne With my clubbe I wyll laye the on the brayne. Mater Well, seinge thou threatenest to me affliction, Spite of my harte have nowe my benediction: Nowe Christes swete blessinge and mine Lighte above and beneath the bodye of thyne And I beseche, with all my devotion, That thou mayste come to Amans promotion. He that forgeve Mary Mawdalene hyr synne Make [thee] hyghest of all thy kynne! Thersites In this wordes is double intellimente: Wouldest thou have me hanged mother, veramente? Mater No, sonne, no, but too have you hye In promocion is my mynde, verelye. Thersites Well then, mother, let all this goo And charme this chylde that you is sende to. And loke hereafter to curse ye be not gredye. Curse me no more; I am cursed ynoughe all readye. Mater Well, sonne, I wyll curse you no more, Excepte ye provoke me to to sore. But I mervaile whye ye do me move To do for Ulisses that dothe not us love. Thersites Mother, by hys sonne he hathe sende me a letter Promysynge heareafter to be to us better And you and I, with my greate clubbe, Muste walke to him and eate a solybubbe, And we shall make merye And synge âtyrle on the beryeâ With Simkyn Sydnam, somner, That kylde a catte at Comner. There the tryflinge tabborer, trowbler of tunys, Wyll pyke Peter Pybaker a penyworth of prunes. Nycholl Nevergood a nette and a nightcappe Knytte wyll for Kyt whose knee cawghte a knappe. David Dowghtye, dyghter of datys, Gren with Godfrey Goodal wyll gretely at the gates Thom Tombler of Tewxbury, turninge at a tryce, Wyll wype Wylliam Waterman if he be not wyse. Symon Sadler of Sudeley that served the sowe Hytte wyll Henrye Hartlesse he harde not yet how. Jynkyn Jaxon, that jobbed jolye Jone, Grynde wyll gromelsede untyll he grone. Prowde Peris Pykethancke, that pyked Pernels purse, Cut wyll the cakes thoughe Cate do crye and curse. Roughe Robyn Rover, rufflinge in ryghte rate, Balde Bernarde Braynles wyll bete and Benet bate. Folyshe Frederycke, furburer of a farte, Dynge Daniell Deintye to deathe wyll with a darte. Mercolfe Movyles, moreninge for mad Marye, Tyncke wyll the tables thoughe he there not tary. Andrewe Allknave, alderman of Andwarpe, Hoppe wyll with holy hockes and harken Humfreys harpe. It is to to, mother, the pastyme and good chere That we shall see and have when that we come there. Wherefore, gentyll mother, I the hartely praye That thou wylte charme for wormes this pretye boye. Mater Well sonne, seinge the case and mater standeth so, I am contente all thy request to do. Come hyther, pretye childe, I will [thee] charme frome the wormes wylde, But firste do thou me thy name tell. Telemachus I am called Telemachus there as I dwell. Mater Telemachus, lye downe uprighte on the grounde And styrre not ones for a thousande pounde. Telemachus I am readye here preste To doo all youre requeste. Then he must lay hym down with his bely upward and shee muste blesse hym frome above too beneath sayinge a[s] foloweth: Mater The cowherd of Comertowne with his croked spade Cause frome the the wormes soone to vade. And jolye Jacke Jumbler, that juggleth with a horne, Graunte that thy wormes soone be all to torne. Good graundsyre Abraham, godmother to Eve, Graunte that this wormes no longer this chylde greve. All the courte of conscience in Cockoldshyres: Tynkers and tabberers, typplers, taverners, Tyttyfylles, tryfullers, turners, and trumpers, Tempters, traytoures, travaylers, and thumpers, Thryftlesse, thevyshe, thycke, and thereto thynne, The maladye of this wormes cause for too blynne. The vertue of the tayle of Isaackes cow, That before Adam in Paradyse dyd lowe, Also the joyste of Moses rod, In the Mounte of Calvarye that spake with God. Facie ad faciem, turninge tayle to tayle, Cause all these wormes quickly to fayle. The bottome of the shyppe of Noe, And also the legge of the horse of Troe, The peece of the tounge of Balaams asse, The chawbone of the oxe that at Christes byrth was, The eye tothe of the dogge that wente on pylgremage With yonge Thobye, these wormes sone may swage. The butterflye of Bromemycham that was borne blinde, The blaste of the bottell that blowed Aelous wynde, The buttocke of the bytter boughte at Buckyngame, The bodye of the bere that wyth Bevis came, The backster of Balockburye with her bakinge pele, Chylde, fro thy wormes, I praye maye sone the hele. The tapper of Tavyestocke, and the tapsters potte, The tothe of the tytmus, the torde of the gote, In the towre of tenysballes tostyd by the fyer, The table of Tantalus turned trym in myre, The tombe of Tom Thredbare that thruste Tyb through the smock, Make al thy wormes, chylde, to come forth at thy docke. Sem, Cam, and Japhat, and Coll, the myllars mare, The fyve stones of Davyd that made Goliath stare, The wing with whiche Seint Mychaell dyd fly to his mount, The counters wherwith cherubyn did cheristones count, The hawke with whiche Assuerus kylde the wylde bore, Helpe that these wormes, my chylde, hurt the no more. The mawe of the morecocke that made Mawd to mowe, When Martylmas at Moreton morened for the snowe, The spere of spanysshe spylbery, sprente with spiteful spottes, The lyghtes of the laverocke, layde at London lottes, The shynbon of Saint Samuell, shyninge so as the sunne, Graunt, child, of the wormes that sone thy paines be don. Mother Bryce of Oxforde and greate Gyb of Hynxey, Also Mawde of Thrutton and Mable of Chartesey, And all other wytches that walke in Dymminges dale, Clytteringe and clatteringe there youre pottes with ale, Inclyne youre eares and heare this my peticion And graunte this childe of healthe to have fruition. The blessinge that Jorden to his godsonne gave, Lyghte on my chylde and from the wormes him save. Now stand uppe little Telemachus anone I warrante the by tomorow thy wormes wyll be gone. Telemachus I thanke you, mother, in my most hartelye wise. Wyll ye, syr, to my father commaunde me anye service? Thersites No, pretye boye, but do thou us two commende To thy father and mother; tell them that we entende, Bothe my mother and I, To see them shortelye. Telemachus Ye shall be hartelye welcome to them I dare well say. Fare ye well, by youre leave, now I wyll departe awaye. Thersites Sonne, geve me thy hande. Fare well. Mater I praye God kepe the from parell. Telemachus goeth oute and the mother sayeth: Ywys it is a proper chylde And in behavioure nothinge wylde. Ye maye see what is good education; I woulde every man after this fasshion Had their children up broughte, Then manye of them woulde not have bene so noughte. A chylde is better unborne then untaughte. Thersites Ye saye truthe, mother, well let all this go And make you ready Ulisses to go to With me anone. Be ye so contente? Mater I am well pleased; to youre wyll I assente, For all thoughe that I love hym but verye evyll, It is good to set a candell before the devyll. Of moste parte of greate men, I sweare by thys fyer, Lyghte is the thancke but heavye is the ire. Fare well, sonne, I wyll go me to prepare. Thersites Mother, God be wyth you, and keepe you frome care. The mother goeth out and Thersites sayeth forth: What somever I saye, syrs, I thyncke: âyll might she [fare]!â I care not if the olde wytche were deade; It were an almoys dede to knocke hyr in the heade And saye on the wormes that she dyd dye, For there be manye that my landes woulde bye. By Goddes blessed brother, Yf I were not seke of the mother! Thys totheles trotte kepethe me harde And suffereth no money in my warde But, by the blessed trinitye, Yf she will no soner ded be, I wyll with a coyshion stoppe hyr breath Tyll she have forgotte Newemarketh heth. Yll myghte I fare Yf that I care Hyr to spare. Aboute the house she hoppeth And hyr nose ofte droppeth When the wortes she choppeth. When that she dothe brewe I maye saye to you I am redy to spew, The droppes to see downe renne, By all chrysten menne, Frome hyr nose to hyr knen. Fye, Goddes bodye! it maketh me to spitte To remember howe that she doth sytte By the fyer brallynge, Scratchinge and scrallynge, And in everye place Leyenge oysters apase; She dothe but lacke shellesâ The devyll have [thy] whytte elles. At nyghte when to bedde she goys And plulcketh of her hose She knappeth me in the nose With ryppe rappe, Flypppe flappe, That an yll happe Come to that tappe That venteth so, Where so ever she go. So muche she daylye dryncketh That hyr breath at both endes styncketh. That a horsecombe and an halter Hyr soone uppe talter Tyll I saye Davydes psalter; That shall be at Nevermas, Whyche never shall be nor never was. [holds up fingers] By this tenne bones, She served me ones A touche for the nones: I was sicke and laye in my bedde; She broughte me a kerchyfe to wrappe on my heade AndâI praye God that I be deade Yf that I lye any whytteâ When she was aboute the kerchefe to knytte, Breake did one of the formes fete That she dyd stande on, And downe fell she anone, And foorth withall As she dyd fall She gyrded oute a farte That me made to starte. I thyncke hyr buttockes dyd smarte. Excepte it hadde be a mare in a carte, I have not harde suche a blast. I cryed and byd hyr holde fast; With that she, nothinge agast, Saide to me that no woman in this lande Coulde holde faste that whyche was not in hyr hande. Nowe, syrs, in that hole pitche and fyre brande! Of that bagge so fustye, So stale and so mustye, So cankered and so rustye, So stinckynge and so dustyeâ God sende hyr as muche joye As my nose hathe alwaye Of hyr unsaverye spice, Yf that I be not wyse And stoppe my nose quickelye, When she letteth goo merelye. But let all this go! I had almoste forget The knave that here yerewhyles dyd jet Before that Telemachus did come in. I wyll go seeche hym; I wyll not blynne Untyll that I have hym, Then so God save hym I wyll so âbeknaveâ hym That I wyll make to rave hym, Wyth this swearde I wyll shave hym, And strypes, when I have gave hym, Better I wyll deprave him That you shall knowe for a slave him. Then Miles cometh in sayinge: Miles Wylte thou so in deede? Hye the, make good spede! I am at hande here prest; Put awaye tongue shakynge And this folysshe crakynge; Let us trye for the best. Cowardes make speake apase, [Strypes] prove the manne. Have nowe at thy faceâ Keepe [off] if thou canne! And then he muste stryke at hym and Thersytes muste runne awaye and leave his clubbe and sworde behynde. Whye, thou lubber, runnest thou awaye And leavest thy swearde and thy clubbe thee behynde? Nowe thys is a sure carde nowe, I maye well saye, That a cowarde crakinge here I dyd fynde. Maysters, ye maye see by this playe in sighte That great barking dogges do not most byte, And oft it is sene that the best men in the hoost Be not suche that use to bragge moste. Yf ye wyll avoyde the daunger of confusion, Printe my wordes in harte and marke this conclusion: Suche gyftes of God that ye excelle in moste Use them wyth sobernesse and youre selfe never bost. Seke the laude of God in all that ye doo; So shall vertue and honoure come you too. But if you geve youre myndes to the sinne of pryde, Vanisshe shall your vertue; your honoure away wil slide. For pryde is hated of God above And meekenesse sonest obtaineth his love. To youre rulers and parentes be you obediente, Never transgressinge their lawefull commaundemente. Be ye merye and joyfull at borde and at bedde. Imagin no traitourye againste youre prince and heade. Love God, and feare him, and after him youre kinge Whiche is as victorious as anye is lyvinge. Praye for His Grace, with hartes that dothe not fayne, That longe he maye rule us withoute grefe or paine. Beseche ye also that God maye save his quene, Lovely Ladie Jane, and the prince that he hath send them betwen To augment their joy and the comons felicitie. Fare ye wel, swete audience, God graunt you al prosperite.
