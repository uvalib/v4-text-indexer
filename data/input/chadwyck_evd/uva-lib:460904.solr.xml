      <field name="fulltext">Scene I. —Grands Mulets on Mont Blanc. Sunset. Lord Margate and his five Companions are discovered at Luncheon. Chorus. Air.—Galop from “Orphée aux Enfers.” Thoughts of care away we fling, And gaily drink and gaily, And gaily sing—and gaily sing— And gaily, gaily, gaily sing. Hither, when our flight we wing With songs we make the welkin ring: The welkin ring, the welkin ring, The welkin, welkin, welkin ring. Solo.—Lord Margate. When home in Piccadilly, Turning, willy, nilly, Little noddles, silly, silly, silly, silly, Each pretty little filly, Polly, Jenny, Tilly, Finds she must to us capitulate. All. —Here we dance and here we sing, &amp;c. Ld. Mar. Marquis of Cranbourne Alley's leave I cry— Lord Pentonville's, and your's, Sir Peckham Rye. You all remember, when we left the shore Of Rule Britannia, we in concert swore We'd do our best, on reaching these localities To show our undisputed nationalities, To show contempt in everything that we did: Tell me, my comrades, how have we succeeded? Marq. of Cran. I've sworn at all who've hindered my researches. Ld. Penton. I've worn my hat in all the foreign churches. Sir Peck. When Frenchmen have conversed with me or you, We've always turned the talk to Waterloo! Ld. Mar. I've half a dozen Frenchmen tried to teach That I'm twelve times as brave and strong as each, And showed that this corollary must follow,— One Englishman can thrash twelve Frenchmen hollow. Marq. of Cran. But did you? Ld. Mar. Well, they asked me if I wouldn't, But they were only six: of course I couldn't! Marq. of Cran. (looking off.) Hillo, who's this, who bounds from crag to crag? Is it “Excelsior,” without his flag? Old sombre garments deck his every limb, Though he's on white crags, black rags are on him. Ld. Pen. See how he bounds o'er yonder frozen plain, From ice to snow, from snow to ice again. Ld. Mar. Well, that's not odd: a man who would look nice Should always have his (s) nose between his ice, Let's watch him unobserved, away you go— Conceal yourselves beneath the frozen snow. Ld. Pen. But it'll be so cold, I'm frozen blue! Ld. Mar. What matter, so you be congealed from view! (They all conceal themselves behind portions of the ‘set,’ when they are hidden, enter Roberto, with alpenstock.) Rob. In dress, and thought, and look, and vocal tone, I'm p'raps the gloomiest party ever known! I'm wretched, dull, uncomfortably broody! The only books I read I get from Moodie; I go about in black and dismal rags, And only care to haunt black beetling crags. This mountain—white—I should in horror shun, But that it is so very often dun. Black nigger songs to sing I only care And breathe a nipping and an iggur air, And do my best to make myself appear Like a cold mute, employed by chilly-bier. Lord Margate and his Companions appear and surround him. Ld. Mar. Declare yourself instanter, or I'll fell you! Your name? Rob. My name? guess three times and I'll tell you. Marq. of Cran. Hamlet! Ld. Pen. The Stranger! Rob. No, that's two already. Ld. Mar. Robinson Crusoe! Rob. Pretty near—Man freddy! Ld. Mar. I know, two years ago at Drury Lane You went on in a manner quite insane; I know, and may I ask without intrusion What is the meaning of your sad seclusion? Rob. (mysteriously,) I'm married, that's the circumstance that kills me! Ld. Mar. (shuddering.) The icy horror of your story thrills me! How could you hope to live 'neath such a ban? Married! Oh you unfortunate old man. Rob. Of all my ills that circumstance the fountain's! Ld. Mar. You call 'em ills, by Jove, I call 'em mountains, Rob. They are—so many I could hardly count 'em, In vain I've often essayed to surmount 'em, But failed in scaling them, full twenty times. What wonder that I fled to other climbs? I was a soldier ere I took a wife, But when I did, she led me such a life; I trembled as I drained my bitter cup: E'en on parade I used to “shudder up!” At length she said, in some domestic strife, “Go fight your country's battles, not your wife.” The notion seemed particularly good, At home I learn't to fight—I fought I would, And so I went, escaping wife and writs To fight the Austrians at Austerlitz: Ten horses were shot under me—sure I'm of it, We had indeed a most horse tryin' time of it; My comrades' blood on every side was spilled, At length my turn arrived, and I was killed! A bullet where my brain should be, went through. Ld. Mar. How sad. (affecting to weep.) Rob. Yes, at the time I felt it, too; I was reported dead, but—do not start, My head is not a very vital part; I had but swooned, nor thought I should be soon dead. Says they, “he's killed,’ thinks I, “Oh no, he's wounded.” When I recovered and became awake, I took advantage of the sad mistake: I came up here, that I might live alone, And shun my scolding wife's upbraiding tone. She drove me mad with everlasting teazin'! Ld. Mar. Up here you'll never feel a loss of (f) reasin.’ (aside.) That squint! that nose! Ha, can it be? It can The Marchioness of Birkenfelt's good man; He left her years ago. I know her well; She's down at Chamouni: a splendid sell 'Twould be to take him down in friendly tether, And bring the loving pair once more together; She persecutes me, 'twill be tit for tat. (To Roberto). Manfred, it seems a thousand pities that A person of your intellectual bent, (crosses left) With such a fund of lofty sentiment, Should waste it on the air—away we'll burk you, And form a joint stock company to work you, Come, with us from your mountain holdfast sally, And try the soothing joys of yonder valley, A decent servant hire, some handy elf, And set a proper valley on yourself. Rob. True, true, I've had enough of mountain dallying Here in my chilly chalet, shilly shallying: This icy solitude I've had my fill on, A pris'ner—and a pris'ner with the chill on, I'll join your party. Ld. Mar. It'll do you good, Rob. I'll be a swell. Ld. Mar. It's just as well you should. Rob. A silky sable wear when out I stir A proper garment for a flossy fur. Lord Margate and Companions offer Roberto Champagne bottle —Business. Rob. Champagne? Ah! once I thought it very plis'nt An empty vanity, (spills wine), oh, no, it isn't! (drinks with disgust.) And there are some who love this filthy drink! Is it champagne? (drinks), no, it's Moselle I think, (drinks.) And this men drink, and then talk wildly, blabbily. (They offer him more.) Hock, and Sauterne? they haven't done it Shabbily. Ha, Burgundy, and Claret, every sort, This summit tall, provides a summit short, Of such a landscape who could take a survey? The mountain's drunk—it's clearly tipsy-turvey, Duet and Chorus.—Air, “For a few days.” Rob. The fumes of wine obstruct my view With a rude haze—with a rude haze— The fumes of wine when mingled, do In a rude haze all things blend! Ld. Mar. But of hours there are twenty four In the true days—in the true days— Yes, of hours there are twenty four 'Ere the true day's at an end! Chorus. Yes, yes, twenty four In the true days—in the true days— Yes, yes, twenty four 'Ere the true day's at an end! Ld. Mar. You musn't talk in this shocking way, For it rude is—for it rude is— Rob. I quite agree in what you say: That it rude is all agree. The books I read, as I said before, Are from Mudie's—are from Mudie's: The books on which I set a store Are from Mudie's libraree! Chorus. Yes, yes, all he reads Are from Mudie's—are from Mudie's— Yes, yes, all he reads Are from Mudie's libraree! Enter Maria from opposite direction. She does not see Lord Margate and his party. Maria. So, half my walk is done, I think I'd best Do my remainder when I've done my rest. (Sits on rock.) An uncongenial seat! I wish I could Exclaim with perfect truth “Sofa so good.” (Sees tourists.) Oh, who are these? I wasn't sir, aware— Ld. Mar. Don't be alarmed, most charming vivandiere, We'll be your escort, may we make so bold? (Maria appears frightened.) Why how you're trembling! If it's caused by cold Accept this coat. (offering fur coat.) Maria. (aside.) I'm in a pretty mess caught! (aloud.) Thanks, I require neither coat nor (w) escort. Ld. Mar. Then tell us why you're here, discarding flam any, Maria. I walked up here from Chamouni. Ld. Mar. Oh, jammini! Maria. My morning stroll is from yon fertile plain, Right up Mount Blanc each day and down again; When I get down again, for bread I'm famine-y. Ld. Mar. What down to even money! Maria. Even cham-money. Ld. Mar. We'll take our toll then, come, kiss all the lot. Yes, by my troth I swear. Maria. (repulsing him.) Betrothed we're not. Ld. Mar. (putting his arm round her.) Sweet avalanche of charms in one fair bunch! Maria. (repulsing him.) An avalanche! you've had an 'eavy lunch. All. We want a kiss. Maria. Well, if I must be kiss't, Of course its useless for me to resist. (aside.) If Tonio would but come to my relief! (aloud.) It's opportunity that makes the thief. Ld. Mar. The opportunity's your pretty face, An opportunity we'll all embrace! (They endeavour to kiss her.) Maria. Help! help! help! help! Respect my accents moany, oh. Oh Tonio, Tonio, where, where art thou, Tonio! (Enter Tonio. She rushes to his arms. Tableau. You are all armed or quickly he'd correct you. Tonio. Don't be all-armed, I'm here, dear, to protect you. (to Ld. Mar.) I'll pitch you over if you touch the girl; You're a pretty fellow for a hurl. (to Maria.) Maria, if he tries to come too near, I'll pitch a snowball at this (s)noball peer. Ld. Mar. Shall a chivalric Earl thus tamely risk her, For such a curl be bearded by this swiss-cur? (to Tonio proudly.) It's Margate's heir, young man, that you're displacing. Tonio. I've heard the air of Margate is (hem!) bracing? My name is Tonio; now, if you please, Inform me who are you, and who are these? (pointing to Tourists.) Trio and Chorus.—Lord Margate, Tonio, Maria, and Companions. Air.—“The Galloping Snob.” Ld. Mar. Whoever can you be, not to know, Not to know, not to know The lolloping nobs of Rotten Row. (Imitating with their alpenstocks the attitude of Rotten Row loungers leaning over the railings, while Tonio and Maria gallop up and down before them.) We are those lolloping nobs, With our fingers in our fobs, We watch the passing cobs, We watch the cobs, the cobs, the cobs, The galloping cobs of Rotten Row. Chorus. We are those lolloping snobs, &amp;c. Tonio. You Al'pine snobs, with your dot and go, Dot and go, dot and go. (Imitating the action of men walking with alpenstocks.) If you dont mind, you'll be shot, and go It will, right through your nobs, Maria. You dreadful Al'pine snobs, With your fingers in your fobs, You dreadful snobs, you snobs, you snobs, You Al'pine snobs, with your dot and go. Chorus. You/we dreadful alpine snobs, &amp;c. DANCE—SCENE CLOSES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chorus. Air.—Galop from “Orphée aux Enfers.” Thoughts of care away we fling, And gaily drink and gaily, And gaily sing—and gaily sing— And gaily, gaily, gaily sing. Hither, when our flight we wing With songs we make the welkin ring: The welkin ring, the welkin ring, The welkin, welkin, welkin ring. Solo.—Lord Margate. When home in Piccadilly, Turning, willy, nilly, Little noddles, silly, silly, silly, silly, Each pretty little filly, Polly, Jenny, Tilly, Finds she must to us capitulate. All. —Here we dance and here we sing, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene II. —Interior of Guardroom. Enter Cospetto meeting Ortensio. Orten. Sergeant Sulpizio's in an awful way Our daughter he's not seen since break of day. Corp. She left this morning, matters not to mince, To climb Mount Blanc and ain't been heard of since! Perhaps she's fallen down some fearful cut in it, Some chasm. Oten. If she has she's put her fut in it! Enter Sergeant Sulpizio. Sul. Where is our daughter? Orten. Up on yonder height. Sul. Once more upon her reckless headlong flight, Bounding from rock to rock! Herself she bears As if that flight were but a flight of stairs. Cos. Oh, she's sure footed quite: you know its true, Come give the darling girl her mountain due, She's like an antelope on ridge or coping. Sul. An antelope? I hope she an't eloping. Enter Maria. Maria. Papa, why what's all this! why look so glum? Sul. (embracing her) My ravings were but empty froth—she's come, (sternly) You should have asked and got the full consent, Of all your fathers, 'ere away you went. Maria. To please a thousand fathers hard for me, How can I when they always disagree? (shivering) I am so cold, how can you treat your ward so? Upon the mount it froze so. Sul. Yes, I thawed so; No wonder you're frozen by your climb, You're precious (s) nowing, and you talk in rime. You shouldn't leave the valley, you're too fragile. Maria. Forgive me! There, to show I'm very agile, At one big bound, although the road's a hard 'un, I go from Chamouni to Pardon—pardon; Sul. (kissing her) Then you're forgiven: now then to reveal A secret which I longer can't conceal, I've always said and you believed it true, You were the Reg'ment's daughter, didn't you? Maria. Oh yes, a thousand fathers now surround me. Sul. (impressively) You're not the Reg'ment's daughter! Maria. (amazed) You astound me! Sul. Long years ago upon a battle plain, The Captain of my company was slain. But ere he died, he handed to my care A pretty Baby beautifully fair, In this silk handkerchief the captain wropped it, [producing handkerchief.] But 'ere I could adopt it, he had hopped it! The baby grew up exquisite indeed, Now she's the fairest flower you ever seed, Maria. (innocently) The fairest flower? Whoever can that be? (suddenly) Why that describes me, father, to a T. Cos. We did our best to our gay life to win you, And fostered military tastes within you, Words of command you early learn't to prattle. Ortensio. The noise of musketry supplied your rattle, When but a tender babe you went to bed, With a percussion cap upon your head. Maria. When I was ill I swallowed like a lamb A nice gun powder well disguised in jam. Sul. You played at cannon balls in mossy dells, And on the shore picked pretty shrapnel shells. Maria. Then every morning sure as day did come Didn't I breakfast on a roll of drum? Sul. Washing it down, as pleasant as could be, With cups of good hot strong gun-powder tea. Maria. I learnt to sew as well as any one— Got through my work well with a needle gun. Sul. The needle gun with which so well you got on You always threaded, darling, with gun cotton; Drill tho' upon parade, you've quite forgot to, Altho' I've often, dear, p(a)rayed you not to, With stitching you began— Maria. There errs your mem, Maria dear commences with a hem, For me, my fathers couldn't have done more. You've always been most kind to me I'm sure, Whene'er I asked an inch, as all can tell, You, though a private soldier, sent an ell. Duet.—Sulpizio and Maria. Air.—“Mazeppa's History.” Maria. The playthings that you bought me, always cost a sum immense, And Cremer had instructions quite regardless of expense; Instructive magic lanterns were the costly consequence, And dolls that were impossible in their magnificence. Yes, in my childhood's happy day, Those were the sort of toys with which I used to play. Instructive magic lanterns were the costly consequence, And dolls that were impossible in their magnificence. Sul. My playthings, as a boy, were neither elegant nor new; A bit of chalk, a rabbit skin, some washerwoman's blue, Some cobbler's wax, a cabbage, half-a-pipe, a lump of glue, A piece of string, a kitten, seven buttons and a shoe! Yes, in my boyhood's happy day, Those were the only toys with which I used to play. Some cobbler's wax, a cabbage, half-a-pipe, a lump of glue, A piece of string, a kitten, seven buttons and a shoe! (COMIC DANCE.) Exeunt Sulpizio, Cospetto, and Ortensio. Tonio pops his head in at the door. Tonio. May I come in, Maria? It's your lover. Maria, Oh, Tonio.—If the serjeant should discover! (Tonio comes in.) The Sergeant's grown suspicious, dear, of late. Tonio. The matter's urgent, dear, and cannot wait: I come to say I love you; wilt be mine? Maria. You love me? yes, that's all extremely fine, You've conquered me, but haven't done your task; My thousand father's leave you first must ask; These gallant soldiers all are my papas! Tonio. Who are your mothers then? Maria. My mothers? Mars! If their consent you can beg, steal, or borrow, I'll be your little wifey dear to-morrow. 'Twas but the accident of fire and sword Made me their protegée, their little ward. Tonio. Oh, what a union! bless you for affording it, A union, too, with such a casual ward in it. Maria. A casual ward? That never very sad is, When cared for by a thousand “kind old daddies.” Duet.—Tonio and Maria. Air—Dites, la jeune belle. Tonio. Sweeter lollipop than— Longer I dare not stay— Maria. Fleeter, never a man, Flew from his love away; My fathers you'll seek—a, I'll be yours in a week—a, If they agreeing are. Tonio. What? a week, without slumber? Maria. Yes, remember their number; Tonio. The date is much too far. Both. Sweeter lollipop than— Longer he dares not stay, Fleeter, never a man, Flew from his love away. (At the conclusion of the Duet, they embrace each other.) Enter Sulpizio. Sul. A “Guide” to Polly paying his addresses I'll give you mustard, Miss, with your caresses, With a mere guide, a poor Mont Blanc explorer! Tonio. (kissing her.) This is my way of showing I adore her. Sul. (dragging him away.) Of these proceedings, sir, I'll have no more. This is my way of showing you a door. (points to door.) Unless you do those loving words rescind, o.’ Sulpizio, here, sal pitz yo out of window. Be off, or you shall go to your account. Maria. Don't treat him so, he did, when on the mount, From six stout English noblemen assist me, Who, led by one, Lord Margate, would have kiss't me. And when my blood was curdled with alarms, He curdled me within his manly arms, He to my rescue, or you'd outlive me; Need I say more, or esk you to forgive me. Sul. (To Tonio.) When first she came among us, sir, we said Maria should a soldier only wed, Into a soldier if you like we'll coin you, If you consent to join us, why we'll join you, (Tonio gives her hand a token of consent.) Trio.—Sulpizio, Maria, and Tonio. Air.—“Ciascun lo dice.” Maria. Tonio devoted ne'er will we part, Your only trump card, pluckily, pluckily playing Sul. You'll be promoted, your loving heart, Down at her tootsies luckily, luckily laying! Tonio, I am devoted as you agree When I'm promoted, wedded we'll be. Maria. What a plan, what a plan, what a plan 'twill be Tonio. What a plan, what a plan to be joined to she. Sul. There never was known such an excellent plan, There never was seen such a brave little man. Air changes to Rataplan Chorus. All. What a plan, what a plan, what a plan, What a plan, what a plan, plan, plan, If I'm right I'll/he'll delight for to fight day and night and at sight he will draw on a foe; What a plan, what a plan, what a plan, What a plan, what a plan, plan, plan, I'm/He's a wight, very dight, ready quite for to bite, like a kite at a chick or a crow. DANCE.—and off together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene III. —Enterior of Marchioness of Birkenfelt's Chateau, in Chamouni. View of Mont Blanc in the distance. A triumphal Arch is seen at the back of the stage hung with evergreens, banners, &amp;c., and the scene generally, conveys the idea that festive preparations are in progress. Villagers superintended by Pumperinickel are discovered hanging Flags, dressing the Arch, &amp;c., On the Arch is inscribed the legend “Of Age to Day.” Bells heard. Enter Lord Margate and his companions, they contemplate the proceedings with dignified curiosity. Ld. Mar. Why bless us, what's all this? What's up, I say? Pump. The Marchioness has come of age to-day. Ld. Mar. Of age, Ha! ha! ha! ha! It's time she did, Why she was thirty, when I was a kid. Pump. (amazed) A splendid creature, for a princess fit, A woman of a thousand, you'll admit. Ld. Mar. One of a thousand! No—but truth to say, She's one of forty seven, if a day! Pump. The cannon's firing, and the bells are ringing, All nature with one voice to-day is singing The very trees rejoice as on she marches, With joyous (s)beeches and triumphal (l)arches. (Pointing to the Arch) That one appears to say, “Hail Beauty's Queen, She's twenty one!” Ld. Mar. (pretending to admire it.) Yes, it's extremely green. Pump. But see, she comes with grace in every feature, (rapturously). Oh, isn't she a charming, charming creature. Lord Margate. Air.—“Oh, how delightful.” Enter the Marchioness from house attended by peasants, throwing flowers; she has all the appearance of a faded Coquette, and her manner is characterized by an affectation of extreme juvenility: all hurrah as she enters. Marchs. Of age, a baby but the other day! How rapidly my years have passed away! Ah, how time flies. Ld. Mar. (aside). So quickly has it run: Her fifty years have seemed like twenty-one! (aloud). No wonder that it passes as you mention, Such beauty must command so much attention. (retires.) Ld. Cran. Those sunny smiles the coldest heart would jog, (aside.) They're very like the sun seen thro' a fog. Ld. Pen. The rose and lily matched, in colour could be! (aside.) Only the rose is where the lily should be. Sir Peck. Yes, strawberries and cream, and all the rest of it, (aside.) Only the strawberries have much the best of it! Marchs. My simple beauty of itself don't tell, I'm worshipped for my rank and wealth as well, I am no fool. (ogling.) Ld. Mar. How roguishly it twinkles! Some one has put you up to lots of wrinkles. Marchs. They were born with me, sir. Ld. Mar. Yes, I'll engage, Your wrinkles, like yourself have come of age. Marchs. Some people say and tell me as a duty, My cheeks are much too ruddy for a beauty. Ld. Mar. The wretch who said so is with falsehood tainted, They're nothing like so ruddy as they're painted. Marchs. That I should use more powder! Ld. Mar. Powder? Puff! Marchs. And that my figure's padded! Ld. Mar. Padded? Stuff! Marchs. My hair a wig, that's rudeness pretty blunt, Ld. Mar. Rudeness? I stigmatize it as affront. Marchs. That it's stained yellow—things which I denied first, Ld. Mar. You stain your tresses yellow? you'd have died first. Pump. The country ringing with your fame of feature, And such a voice. Ld. Mar. Yes, you are a famous (s) creature. Pump. Now villagers, a dance, and soldier's too Her ladyship would see what you can do, The anniversary, friends, of her birth You've got some ground for showing her some mirth. Grand Ballet; at the conclusion, the Marchioness goes into the house with her attendants: then enter Roberto. Rob. Poor thoughtless butterflies, they little think That grief is joy disguised in robes of ink. Ld. Mar. Well, Manfred, this is better far I guess Than life up there in lazy loneliness. Rob. Lazy! Ha, ha; I really thought you knew The nature of the work I had to do; For fifteen years I've been engaged for one In tunnelling the Alps: it's not yet done, Sulp. For fifteen years! I'd freely have assured them That long 'ere this you'd thoroughly have bored them. Rob. Gigantic rocks and frozen mountains too, You've no idea what I had to go through. Sulp. Console yourself with this reflection aided, You didn't go through half as much as they did. Ld. Mar. The Marchioness you've seen, (winking.) Rob. What makes you wink so? Ld. Mar. A splendid woman! Rob. (interested.) Is she? Sulp. I should think so. Rob. Well, well, what matters it although she be? That sort of thing has passed away from me. Though I was once, you'd hardly think it—yet, I was the jolliest dog in all my ‘set.’ The evening parties that I gave unfurled The jolliest little suppers in the world. Cut oranges and sandwiches a plateful, And ginger wine, but still they were ungrateful; My sandwiches aside they'd coolly put 'em, And wouldn't even take this 'and which cut 'em: My ginger wine, they'd openly contemn, As if my ginger wine could (g) injure them. Yes, at my parties, somehow, all seemed surly, They didn't go, although my guests did—early. TRIO.—Roberto, Lord Margate, and Sulpizio. Air.—Payne's Cap Dance in Cinderella. Rob. Oh, of all men I have been the most unfortunate. Ld. Mar. Words, which cannot fail their hearers all to shock: Rob. Woe, for fools alone to know me are importunate; Sul. Birds, whose feathers are the same, together flock: Rob. (irritated.) Dickies of a feather, says the proverb, fly together, But I do not seem to see that that applies to me. Sul. and Ld. Mar. (laughing)— Dickies of a feather, says the proverb, fly together, But he doesn't seem to see that that applies to he. Rob. Why must I in vain for sympathy be calling out? Ld. Mar. You of course can't understand how that can be: Rob. I with fools cannot get on, we're always falling out: Sul. Two of one profession never do agree. Rob. (irritated.) Two of a profession don't agree, but that expression Doesn't seem, in my opinion, to apply to me. Sul. and Ld. Mar. (laughing)— Two of a profession don't agree, but that expression Doesn't seem, in his opinion, to apply to he. (French grotesque Dance. Roberto slides off to the slow movement, and Lord Margate follows him, imitating his action. Then enter Ortensio, Cospetto, and Soldiers, all weeping.) Cos. Here's tidings! Our Maria we shall lose, To-night I'll get no slumber thro' this noose. (Enter Sulpizio). Sul. The regiment blubbering, beyond a doubt, Wriggling and weeping! what's it all about? Ort. We're reg'lars, and not wrigglers. Sul. It appears You're more like wrigglers mixed with fallen tears, (Enter Marchioness.) Marchs. Why, what's all this; all weeping unexpect'ly, And I of age to-day? Rejoice directly. To-day with joy you should away be carried. Ort. Our Vivandiere is going to be married. Sul. The Regiment's daughter, she on girlhood's brink, At least we've always daught her so to think; Because when borne to us in utter dearth, We gave the friendless little child a berth. Ort. We gave her then a place, her fortune made is. Sul. Well, soldiers always should give place to ladies, Away for some one else she wants to fling us: The viper that we've warmed now turns to sting us: The tears come welling when I think on't! Marchs. Does 'em. Sul. And thus I tear the wiper from my buzzum. (Takes a very common pocket handkerchief from his breast and wipes his eyes on it.) Marchs. (startled.) That handkerchief to me one moment give, (looking at mark.) My late lamented husband's as I live! It was his only one, he loved it so! His habit was to wear it. Sul. Were it though? Marchs. See, here's his name, by me the writing's done In patent marking ink, “Roberto—One.” Sul. I always thought and always said it too, The day would gum when this would give some glue: My shipwrecked hopes clung to that fond belief, And my chief anchor was this handkerchief. Marchs. To me his death a blow tremendous dealt; The mainstay of the house of Birkenfelt: I let it when he first paid nature's debts At Austerlitz, and now the 'ouse to let's! We had one girl—a female—one alone: He was the most devoted father known; Towards the infant he felt such attraction, He always took it with him into action, There they were killed, no doubt of that I fear! Sul. (who has been struggling with his feelings during this speech.) The Captain was—the little Babe is here! Enter Maria, followed by Lord Margate and his companions, who are annoying her with their attentions. Marchs. (embracing Maria.) My child! I hav'nt seen her, that I know, Since she was born, just nineteen years ago. Ld. Mar. Then this astounding fact remains untold, You must have been a Ma at two years old. Marchs. She's got her mother's eyes, her mother's fin, Her mother's nose, her mother's little chin. Sul. But no one in her conduct ever saw Her mother's cheek, nor yet her mother's jaw. Marchs. Prepare to leave these soldier-folk to-day And join our family without delay. We're going to dinner, please to look alert. Sul. To dinner? No—you're going to desert. Marchs. Don't tease her so, or else away I'll hurry her, A soldier needn't always be a worry-er! CONCERTED PIECE. Air—Oh Mary, oh Mary. Sul. Most unhappy we are, losing our Maria: Us of her, this fat old female's going for rob. Maria. I shall miss you greatly, all disconsolately, I shall sigh, and sob, and cry, and sigh, and sob. Sul. Oh, Tarry, Oh Tarry; Tonio, you're bound to marry. Oh, Tarry, Oh Tarry, How can you treat your true love so. Chorus. Oh, Tarry, &amp;c. Marchs. She's clearly in our power, a lovely little flower, The very image of her ma, as any one can see. Ld. Mar. Honeysuckle, lily, Cowslip, daffodilly, Mignionette and violet, and a sprig of rosemary; Sul. Rose-mary, rose-mary, Is a type of this young fairy, Rose-mary, rose-mary, Bunch of the sweetest flowers that grow. Rose-mary, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene IV. —Interior of Guard Room, enter Ortensio meeting Tonio dressed as a Soldier. Ort. Well, Tonio, I suppose you've heard the news, Our Vivandiere beloved, we soon shall lose. Tonio. Maria! Ort. Yes, Maria, as we named her. The Marchioness of Birkenfelt has claimed her. (Exit.) Tonio. Burked? Agony! Then we shall parted be? Oh, how this Burkin' will be felt by me. (Enter Maria and Sulpizio.) Maria, say, is this report quite true? Sul. Ah, my young shaver, you may well look blue. Maria. Yes, Tonio, we must part for ever. Tonio. Why? Maria. Because our ranks apart so widely lie. You, in a private soldier's humble dress, A marchin' are—and I'm a marchin' ess. Tonio. But then, you are so brave, so good to all, You've always been adored by great and small; In action, always present, like a brick, With good strong brandy, tending on the sick, With pity, evergreen. Sul. Green! He's aware. Her pity takes the form of petit verre. (To Maria) For cognac you would never let them pay, You always put it down, and so did they. Tonio. I've always paid my score, though long it be, For eau-de-vie, I never owed a fee. Maria. Farewell, my drum! none could your parchment rap So well as I. Sul. (pointing to her canteen) I always liked your tap. Maria. I ne'er shall beat you more, Adoo! Adoo! I bid a long tata to my tattoo. Trio—Tonio, Maria and Sulpizio. Air—“Tootle on the Cornet.” Sul. Your thoughts when you have left our band, Will take a wider range, You'll wear expensive dresses, And a pocketful of change; In lavish stream will flow the fount, Of skilly and of toke, With more Cigars than you can count; But no you never smoke, Our heart was all her own, To ribbons she has torn it; To take her from us thus is very Brutal! brutal! brutal! but I've borne it! Tonio. You'll go to bed at 5 a.m. Get up at 12 or 1, And drive or go to Rotton Row; And when your ride is done, You'll lunch at three and then maybe, Drive out and make a call, Then drive at eight, and go in state, To opera and ball. Maria. What quite forget my friends? I beg to say I'd scorn it, My grief I will embody in a, Tootle, Tootle, Tootle, on the Cornet. CORNET SOLO.—Maria. Maria. I'll weigh my anchor now, or else I'll melt,— Say nothing to my mother; if you felt The weight of her displeasure, you'd not thank her. Sul. She knows it's heavy, for she's weighed her rancour, She's now a lady, high in rank and style, While you, you know, are only rank and vile. Enter Marchioness and Pumpernickel. Marchs. Come, daughter, bid these people all good-bye, Prepare to start, and don't begin to cry. Pump. The train starts in five minutes, as I've reckoned, To pack up now you've only got a second. Sul. A harder case I never, never knew, Once more, adoo! (embracing her.) Maria. Well if I must—Adoo! Tonio. Adoo! (embracing her.) Maria. Adoo! March. Stop billing it, and cooing it, Say good-bye and don't be so long a-dooing it. Tonio. (desperately.) Don't take her, madame, or let me go too. Marchs. And may I ask, sir, who on earth are you? From whom descended, from what Royal fountains? Tonio. Descended! From Mount Blanc, the King of Mountains! Marchs. Descended from the mountain, stupid lout! Sul. Yes, he's the mountain heir you've heard about; The heir-apparent. Marchs. Judging from his tone, An heir much more presumptive ne'er was known; And what's his character? Tonio. It's most illustrious; I'm cleanly, honest, sober, and industrious. Pump. It can't be done, the Marchioness allows No followers whatever in her hows. Sul. (aside to Tonio.) In silence you must love, for once be cowed. Tonio. In silence! Sul. Yes, no followers aloud. (Clock strikes four. Quintette.—Marchioness, Maria, Tonio, Sulpizio, and Pumpernickel. Air.—“Din, din, din, din, minuit sonne.” Marchs. Din, din, din, din, There's the hour, Maria. Din, din, din, din, Oh dear, what shall I do! Pump. Din, din, din, din, It is fower, Sul. Din, din, din, din, This day we all shall rue. Tonio. (wildly.) Oh, for one moment stay, ma'am, Don't take my love away ma'am, Or take me too, I pray, ma'am, Or I shall crazy go! Marchs. This man is most annoying! Sul. Such words in vain employing! Pump. False hope his love is buoying Maria. How I love he'll never know. Bonsoir! Tonio. Bonsoir! Marchs. Bonsoir! Sul. Bonsoir!

      <field name="fulltext">Scene V. —Gardens attached to the Marchioness's house. (Enter Pumpernickel meeting Cocotte) Pump. A pretty state of things, upon my word, Since first that recognition strange occurred; A serjeant, and a lot of soldiers too, Have lived with us with naught on earth to do. Cocotte. Well, what of that? They're all nice looking men, Ah, who would think twelve months had passed since then; We've been so merry since they first came here, It's one continual grin from year to year. From gaiety to gaiety we're carried, Maria to Lord Margate's to be married. Pump. Maria married; oh, that makes me sad. (melo-dramatically.) A whisper! Cocotte. Well! Pump. I love her; yes, like mad! (Cocotte surprised) But that's not all, shall I go on? Cocotte. Oh yes! Pump. You may have heard p'raps of the Marchioness? Cocotte. My mistress! why of course, what's she to you? Pump. Well then, Ha, ha, ha, ha! I love her too! Cocotte. You do! Pump. But that's not all I've got to tell. Cocotte. Indeed, what more? Pump. I worship you as well! Yes, for all three for months I've angling been, Cocotte. Angling? Ha! ha! Tri-angling you must mean. Enter Lord Margate and Roberto who is dressed in ludicrously showy costume. Ld. Mar. (to Pump.) Summon my friends—the contract's here to sign, Which makes Maria's hand and fortune mine, (Exeunt Pump. and Cocotte. R.) For two long years I've waited since I met them. Rob. For two long years? Well you deserve to get them You'll never find, as it to me appears, A better ornament than two long ears. Enter Marchioness. Marchs. Lord Margate's come, his blushing bride to find, Though when he sees her, he may change his mind. Powder and paint she christens dirty messes! She won't “go off” unless her hair she dresses: So great a gun as she should be much prouder, (Enter Sulpizio.) Sul. No great gun can “go off” without some powder. Marchs. I've always worn it since I first could read, And see how I've gone off. Sul. You have indeed. (aside.) Marchs. She still goes out wherever she is sent to Dressed a la Figlia del Regimento In coat of scarlet cloth, turned up with camlet. Sul. She'll always always be a figlia, while she am let. Lord Margate comes down with Roberto. Ld. Mar. This gentleman has just this moment come, (introducing.) The Marchioness—Haw!—Mr. Manfred—Hum! Manfred, the Marchioness, (aside) and now she's righted! Rob. (with great affectation.) Haw! lovely creature, 'pon my life delighted, This is indeed a pleashaw; 'pon my soul, Most happy 'sure you. Can't my joy control. During this speech the Marchioness has coyly concealed her face. Marchs. You bad man go along, (tapping him with her fan.) Rob. In form and feachaw, You are indeed a most superior creechur The numerous advantages you see, A concentrating of themselves in me, Under your notice I should like to bring, I'm single, haw, and all that sort of thing, A Bachelor, who is tired of single life And wants to marry. Marchs. (coyly showing her face.) Go away. Rob. (starts.) My wife! Marchs. My husband! It's my long lost count Roberto, Roberto certo, living and unhurt, O! (embraces him.) Rob. If I had had a notion, whom thou wer't, O! Rather than quit the Alps, I'd have been scalped, (assignedly.) I can't go back, what's done cannot be alped. Concerted Piece Marchioness, Roberto, Lord Margate and Sulpizio. Air.—Market Gardener. Rob. Oh, upon my word and honour— Till I cast my eye upon her, I'd no notion she was such a near relation. Marchs. You're as cruel as Bishop Bonner: I'm a broken hearted Donna! Pray remark my unexampled agitation. Sul. Such a thing I never knew— Why, whatever will they do, Oh, isn't this a striking situation; It's enough a man to nettle. Ld Mar. Now this matter can't I settle, Or do anything by way of mediation. Sul. I'm familiar with the clatter of her chatter, chatter, chatter, She's a lady of excessive animation. Marchs. You may beat me to a batter, But I'll shew you what's the matter! You may well exhibit signs of perturbation. Ld. Mar. Oh, isn't this a go? all circumstances shew You had better have declined my invitation. Rob. Oh, I wish upon my honor, I had never looked upon her; Or descended from my recent elevation. Chorus. Oh, my! why, Roberto, why, Didn't you decline his invitation. Don't you wish, upon your honor, You had never looked upon her, Or descended from your recent elevation. At the end of concerted piece, all go off into the house, except Lord Margate. Enter Maria. Ld. Mar. Allow me, dear, on this auspicious day, To offer you this exquisite bouquet. (offering bouquet.) Maria. (returning it) I like to pick my flowers all alone, I always find that when I cull my own, The odour seems much sweeter to the nose. Ld. Mar. Odour cull own—you'd call it, I suppose! I'm the best match, my dear, in all the South, Born with a silver spoon Miss, in my mouth— Maria. A silver spoon? how very shocking! Ld. Mar. Eh! Maria. It seems to have affected all you say! Ld. Mar. Once, you would sigh, and when I left you, fret— And squeeze my hand, but now I only get A frigid shake, that's not behaving nicily. Maria. You say that I press coldly! Ld. Mar. Yes, press-icily. From life's rude blasts you'll safely lie, my dear, Undering the sheltering lee of Margate peer. The Isle of Thanet's yours, for so I'll plan it, Your love I value much more highly than it. Maria. But you have railed so long at married life. Ld. Mar. I'm changed completely, and I want a wife, Love it as much as once I did detest it, And pleasure take in all that can suggest it. I find an occupation most enticing, Even in watching tars their timbers splicing, I love the sands and long have on them tarried. Cause, when the sea goes down it leaves them arid; But never will consent with crowds to mingle Upon the beach as long as it is shingle; In life connubial I'll be all to thee, Tell me, my love, can you be all to me. (Enter the Marchioness with Notary and Soldiers, Peasants and Guests, and Sulpizio.) Marchs. Here is the marriage contract, daughter Mine, The Notary's prepared to seal and sign. Maria. (reading contract.) Don't seal it yet, a trifling flaw I spot: It says that I consent, and I do not; You'd better far, if fairly you'd be dealing, Repair the flaw, ere you begin the sealing. Marchs. Amazement! Do you know, miss, what you've said? Maria. Without my father's leave I'll never wed. Marchs. Your father's? Maria. Yes, Sulpizio's! Marchs. Very fine! (to Sul.) We want the girl at once the deed to sign: Speak on the point, to you, she said she'd rather first. Maria. In other words, I said I'd see you father first. My Tonio will return and scare these folk, True as the mistletoe unto the oak. Sul. (aside.) 'Ere this by Charon o'er the Styx he's ferried, Like mistletoe, I'm pretty sure he's berried. Maria. The most accomplished soldier ever drilled. Marchs. Well, as for that, he certainly is (s)killed. Maria. His grief would quite destroy his handsome phiz. Ld. Mar. He couldn't be more “cut up” than he is! (Enter Cocotte and Pumpernickel. L.) Cocotte. Oh, madam, for one moment please to wait, Here's a poor wounded soldier at the gate, He says he must come in, he brings some news About poor Tonio. Maria. (to Marchs.) Oh, you won't refuse? Marchs. Indeed, I will. (to Cocotte.) Keep him outside the gate. (Enter Tonio. L.) Tonio. The soldier didn't feel inclined to wait. Maria. My Tonio! Marchs. This is extremely fine. Ld. Mar. (taking Maria.) I am Lord Margate, and the lady's mine. Sul. (to Ld. Mar.) Say, are you covered, pardon the allusion, With strawberry marks in prodigal profusion? Two on each shoulder, on your bosom four; Twelve on your back, on each arm seven more; Three on your left foot, nine upon each knee; Five on your calves, upon each elbow three, Just sixty six in all. Ld. Mar. (rapidly counting.) Exactly so. Sul. Then you are not the Earl of Margate! Marchs. (surprised.) No! Sul. No peer of Margate, young, old, short, or tall, Had ever any strawberry marks at all. Tonio. (suddenly.) I have no strawberry marks. Sul. Ha! Then I see The rightful Earl of Margate you must be; I can't help saying, for so well I knows yer, This is a most extrawberry disclosure. (Enter Roberto with paper, hurriedly. L.) Rob. Here's a dispatch that's just delivered been, For Captain Tonio, from his King and Queen. (reads) “As a slight recompense for all you've done, Your country now appoints her gallant son Head Constable of all the Royal Towers; Chief Councillor of European powers; Chancellor too, of every King's resources; Field Marshal of all continental forces; Lord Admiral of all terrestrial seas; Governor too, of all our colonies; Prince of a dozen countries, here and there; Duke of most places, Earl of everywhere!” Marchs. (Giving Maria to Tonio.) Take her, she's yours—you have my full consent, To give her to you, all along, I meant. (to Lord Mar.) Come, you be off, go to the right about. Ld. Mar. Preposterous old female, you get out! MARIA. I think I've shown myself throughout my part, True to my regiment and my Tonio's heart; As true as iron, to both kinds of cores: I've given him my hand, pray give me your's. “True to the Corps!” be you in mode emphatic, True to what “Corps?” True to my “Corps dramatique.” FINALE. Air—“Eclipse Galop.” Sal. And now our fun to earth is run, The play is nearly ended, We must admit the fact, that it Can hardly be defended. Ld. Margate. And true it is, that now to this, Conclusion we awaken, That many a grievous liberty, With it we've freely taken. Rob. (frantically.) Sally come up and Sally go down I've made a great sensation. Tonio. He's mad as he can fairly be, Don't heed his peroration. Rob. Skidamalink and a tippity wink, And an ounce of approbation. All. —He's mad as he can fairly be, Can fairly, fairly be. Maria. Give your hands, don't be too critical, Breaking flies on wheels—I pity call, Give your hands, don't be too critical, Give your hands and come another day. All. And now our fun, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
