      <field name="fulltext">Scene Bednal Green.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Enter Bedford, Sir Robert Westford, Captain Westford and Souldiers. Bed. You Peers of England that with awfull dread Drum. Have pac'd on the green Garments of fair France, Here cease a while, and give the French-men rest, That they may know whose Soveraignty is best, Either the Dolphins, or our Royal Lords. But what avails our Conquests far from home, When civil Discords stir uncivil arms In the Kings Chamber, London, nay, his Court? See Lords, read what is written there. By blest St. Peter, Gloster is to blame, And Winchester hath neither grace nor shame. Sir Rob. Yes my Lord, he is Lord Cardinals grace. Bed. Lord Cardinal! marry fie, he was proud before, But now his Hat exalts his proud heart more: But when I come among them, Ile make them know The benefit of Peace; fall out for women, Wrangle at a word? the one's Protector Of a sacred Prince, the other made a Prince Drum afar off. Amongst the Prelates; though Bewford basely born Ile write to them: if with regardless eves our lines they read, VVe'll over and cut off their factious head Sir Rob. About old Playnseys son what says your Excellency? Bed. Sir Walters son, marry Sir Rob. Westford; March afar off. This Drum I think marcheth from Amiens, It should be he, I sent him for the Prisoners. Enter young Plainsey with Drum and Souldiers, and a Switzar. Y. Playn. Health to your Excellence most gracious Regent, Playnsey long Prisoner in Amiens, Releast by Momfords bounty and your care, Requests before these Prisoners be dismist This Switzar may be searcht, for last night late I heard a Gentleman tell him in Dutch, If he would bear a Letter to a Lord, VVith whom Veleires had intelligence, He should receive in hand ten Crowns in gold, And 30 more when 'twas deliver'd him. Bed. Who was it promis'd you so large reward? Switz. On frolick yonker, Dat is de Scryven Ick Doeniit for-stow De secretarie to Van Here Velieres Bed. He was the Secretary to the Governour? Swiz. Yaw, yaw, mine Here. Bed. Who were they sent unto? Swiz. To van Heren Montford dat is de grave van Callis ant van Guynes, Dar is deen script deen Letters watt you see then. Bed. To Momford! what should Veleires write to Momford. Read. Sr. Rob. Playnsey is this the plot for Momfords fall? Y. Playn. It is, and be assured that down he shall. Sr. Rob. Oh let me hugg thee! thou hast won my heart! Y. Playn. Forbear, lest the sharp eye of Jealousie, See by this suddain Joy our Injury. Sir Rob. When it breaks forth wee'l seem to weep for grief. Bed. Lords take your places, and Mr. Playnsey take your seat, For in this business your desert is great. See here's a Letter sent from Amiens unto Momford. Omnes. How, unto Momford! Bed. Yes, and if this speak right, Momford betray'd Guynes on Friday night, And means to morrow ere the Sun be set To yield up Callis to the enemy. Cap. West. High Heaven for-send it, gracious General. I think there breaths not a more noble Spirit In any Souldiers breast, than noble Momfords. Y. Playn. I'le gage my life Lord Momford will be loyal. Bed. We would be loath to find him otherwise: Enter Momford. But here he comes himself, his eyes bewray Sorrow, as clowds fore-shew a stormy day. Monf. Better success betide my Noble Lords, Than hath befaln the miserable Momford. Bed. What hath befaln thee? Momf. Guynes, Guynes, is betray'd. Bed. And when must Callis be surrendered? Momf. Never while Momford hath the charge of it. Bed. Yes, if thou have the charge of it this night It must be yielded unto false Veleires. Here's a large promise of ten thousand Marks, Your raise for Fridays work in yielding Guynes. Know you this hand? Oh that on silver hairs, After much honour won in flowring Youth, Should sit so huge a shame as on thine doth. Momf. My Lord! Lords all! this is conspiracy. Bed. True, conspiracy in thee, for there he stands That should have brought that Letter to thy hands. Momf. This fellow fled from Hance Beamart the Traitor, The Walloon Captain that betray'd the Lanthorn, And so by consequence the Fort of Guynes. Bed. Momford no more, his free confession Hath purchased his pardon, fellow stay Amongst our English, and expect good pay. Swiz. Thank hab mine Here, lets Jacob gilt habben, And Ick fall fight wid ten hunderd towsand Divels. Exit Switz. Momf. Shall such a one touch Momfords reputation? Bed. These Letters and the accidents succeeding Condemn thee, and thou know'st by Law of Arms Thou merit'st death with more than common torture: But thy exceeding vallour of en tride, Sets open Mercies gate, whose gentle hand Leads thee from death, but leaves thee banished From England, and the Realms and Provinces Under protection of the English King, Only thy Lands and Goods thou shalt enjoy, And wheresoere from them be still maintain'd. Monf. My gracious Lord! Bed. Thou find'st but too much grace. Momf. Here me but speak. Bed. No more; we must away, To win by force the Town thou didst betray. Exeunt. Momf. Oh miserable! miserable man! Falls. West. Why do you faint? why fall you on the ground? Sir Rob. Cosen arise. Manet Momford Sir Rob. Y. Playnsey, and Cap. Westford. Y. Playn. Father, you are my Father! The Lady Elizabeth your noble Daughter Is my affied wife, for her sake rise, And stop this tide of woe that drowns your eyes. Momf. Oh miserable, miserable Man! Dishonours-abject, base reproaches scorn, Why was mine age to this disaster born? Cap. West. Comfort your self, let not condemn'd despair Add to your sorrow, more than common care. If you be just, as I suppose you be, Know Innocence ends not in misery; Kings have had falls, great Souldiers overthrown, No riches in this earth is a mans own, He strives, he toyls, with many pains he takes it, In an age gets it, in one hour forsakes it. Enter Luce the Landeresse and 3 others. Vitler. Hee's yonder yet, hee's digrac'd, and can do us no more good, Therefore let every man ask his own. Follow me Sirs, Ile speak to the purpose and stand too't. Luce. Nay Sutler by your leave I'll stand to the best man in the Army, And have my due before the proudest of ye, if I do not, Say Luce the Landress is your Shee-asse to bear for others, I'll venture upon him, let him take it as he will. Enter Souldier All. Do Luce, wee'l be rul'd by thee. Luce. My Lord, my Noble Lord, I am sorry for your weak estate, I hope for all this to see you up again, here's 4 poor Creatures of us; amongst the rest I am Luce your poor Landress, that have washt you, and trim'd you, and starch't you, and as I have done for you, I have done my part with all your company, heres my Bill, I pray see me crost. Momf. VVhat do I owe thee woman? Luce. Nine pound, nine shillings, and nine pence my Lord. Momf. There's 10 pound for thee. Luce, Oh good Noble man! that ever, that ever I should see thee thus down, adown! Vitler. Your poor Vitler Sir, where your Lordships men went o'th' ticket. Armor. Your Armorer an't please your Honor. Carter. Your Carter Sir for carriages. Momf. VVhat owe I thee? Vitler. Some (7 marks) an't like ye. Monf. VVhat thee? Armor. Twelve pound. Momf. VVhat thee? Carter. About some 20 Nobles. Momf. Ther's 30 pound amongst ye, all I have, The Treasurer owes me some two thousand Marks. All 4. God blesse ye Sir, and send it ye. Exeunt Luce and the rest. Momf. VVherefore stayest thou my Friend? Oh I know thee now! Thou art not impudent, thou canst not begg, Thou art a Souldier, and thy wound-plow'd face Hath every furrow fill'd with falling tears, That arms and honour should be thus disdain'd. I have no gold to give thee, but this chain, I pray thee take it friend, thou griev'd at me, And I am griev'd thy want and wounds to see. Sould. My silent prayer my hearts love shall express. Heaven succour you, as you help my distress. Momf. Brother Sir Robert, if you do not scorn Momfords disgraced name, and Mr. Playnsey, Son I should call ye if all vows be kept, VVill you vouchsafe to tarry here a while Till I go down unto the Treasurers tent? It may be he will pay me all my due. Y. Playn. Father I'll wait for you, and weep for woe, That I have liv'd to see your overthrow. Sir Rob. VVell, I'll stay too, or bear ye company, For your distress doth make my woes abound. Momf. Come Cosen Captain Westford walk with me. Cap. West. To do you good I'd go though't be to death. Exeunt. Manet Sir Robert, and young Playnsey. Sir Rob. Ha, ha, ha, gill, gill, gill, I have been ready to burst. Son pray thee tell me how thou laid'st this plot? Y. Playn. Marry Sir Robert thus, when I perceiv'd Your great desire for Momfords overthrow, I got intelligence at Amiens, How one Beaumart a Captain in Guynes Fort Offer'd to sell it to the Governor, Having this light, about a two months since, I wilfully was taken Prisoner, Born into Amiens, where I was confirm'd And knew the very time of taking Guynes, On Thursday evening I attir'd my self Like Veleires Secretary Lanclot, Came to the Prison where the Switzer lay, For I had liberty to walk the Town, Had all my Ramsome ready sent by Momford, And only tarryed for our English Drum, That should exchange French Prisoners for the English, The Switzar being one that stay'd with us. Sir Rob. So, I understand ye; but in the end How dealt ye with the Switzar for the Letter? Y. Playn. I brought it home in secret, gave him charge To give it Momford with all able speed, Promising 30 Crowns, besides those ten I gave him first, of noble Momfords bounty: He took me for Veleires Secretarie; But now you see the end, Momford's disgrac'd, And I am unsuspected in this case. Sir Rob. Excellent good! I hugg thee gentle Playnsey. Y. Playn. But tell me pray, How goes all in England? Sir Rob. Marry I'll tell thee Gill, thy Fathers Ward The Lady Ellenor, shall be his Wife. Y. Playn. The Duke of Gloster will not suffer that. Sir Rob. Tut, tut, it's all but talk, it's all but lyes; So does the Cardinal make show of Love, But tittle tittle tattle, all's but talk, He shall have Lady Ellenor no doubt, Say she die childless, there is land for you, You marry with my daughter, shee's my heir, Still Mr. Playnsey there is land for you; I'll turn out Momfords daughter forth of doors, Seise all her goods and lands by a device; Still Mr. Playnsey there is Land for you. Y. Playn. But how I pray? What colour have you for it? Sir Rob. Marry Son thus, About a twelve month since Momford in trust made me a Deed of Gift Of all he had, excepting certain land Morgag'd unto a Norfolk man, one Strowd of Harling, Now Sir I am acquainted with an odd Consort, One Canbee, that doth serve the Cardinal. Y. Playn. Oh he can cheat, take purses, forge mens hands. Sir Rob. The same, the same, he rac'd out that Exception, And put in other matter to my liking: So I'll defeat old Strowd, turn out Besse Momford, All shall be mine, and after mine all thine. Y. Playn. No more, Momford returns. Enter Momford, and Captain Westford. Momf. Captain, Ye see That men dejected bust bear injury. He knowes I am exil'd, and cannot stay, And yet he drives me to a longer day. Cap. Westford, There is a hundred pound, ye shall not chuse. Sir Rob. Ifaith my Noble Cozen, I and Playnsey Are without mony, but send into England, Ye shall not want for 20 thousand pound. Momf. Brother Sir Robert I put trust in you, This Ring shall come within a day or two. Sir Rob. I cannot speak for grief! Momf. No more can I, This wind ere the Sun set will let you see London, that nere must be beheld of me. Commend me to my Daughter, love her Playnsey; Part silent, let your sighs serve for reply. They embrace. Captain think on Strowds morgage, and farewell. Exeunt, manet Momf. They shall see London, they shall see my Child, But Momford must nor, for he is exil'd. I am exil'd, Yet I will England see, And live in England 'spight of infamy. In some disguise I'll live, perhaps I'll turn A Beggar, for a Beggars life is best, His Dyet is in each mans Kitchin drest, But first I'll like an aged Souldier Carry mine own Ring to Sir Robert Westford, They say 'tis good to try Friends, him I'll try, Though I believe he love me stedfastly. Ex. Momf. Enter old Playnsey, and Lady Ellenor. Lady. Sir Walter Playnsey. Old Playn. Lady Ellenor, You are too strong in this opinion, I yield you are my wardship, and that desire To your Revenews, more than true hearts love, Enforc'd me beg your wardship of the King. Lady. I do believe you Sir, for did you look Into my State with an indifferent eye, Or love me half so well as you make shew, You wouldâ Old Playn. Come, come, I know what you would say, You think I am your Foe, because I keep you From private conference with the Duke of Gloster, And his proud Uncle the Lord Cardinal, That divers times have practis'd sundry plots To steal you from my house. Lady. Your love's but feign'd, Because you say you love me for my living. Old Playn. I say my first love took first life from thence, But since more dear familiarity Hath brought forth perfect and true shapen love. I love you Lady, and you are mine own, Mine in possession, and I do intend To make you mine by lawfull marriage, Then blame me not if being all my joy, And the high-prized Jewel of my heart, I over-look you with a wary eye, Lest Gloster, or the Bastard Cardinal Should with their swelling Protestations, Knock. Cheat my fair meaning of thy hopefull love. Enter a Serv. Serv. Sir here's a Servant from the Duke of Gloster Hath brought you Letters. Old Playn. How! Letters to me! No thou mistak'd, they come to Ellenor, Enter Gloster disguised with a Letter. Glost. My Lord and Master greets Sir Walter Playnsey, Old Playn. I do accept his honourable love With more than mean or ordinary care. Reads He doth intreat me to come and speak with him About some certain Letters come from France, Touching the present fortunes of my Son Lately tane Prisoner by the bloodie French. He shall command far more than he intreats. Knocks. How now? whose that which knocks? Enter Serv. Serv. One of the Cardinals men. Old Playn. Bid him to come in. Enter the Cardinal disguised with Letters. Card. Sir Walter Playnsey, From my Lord Cardinals grace of Winchester I greet thee well, and charge thee without stay To come, and answer such objections As may by him be laid unto thy charge Glost. Oh you should be his Sumner by your message. Card. And if I do not take my marks amiss Thou shouldest be Glosters Skullion. Glost. How ye Groom? I am as good a man, and better born Than up-start Bewford the base Cardinal. Card. Sirrah! wert not thou in presence of this Lady Whose love my Lord doth prize above his life, I'd scorn to take these braves at Glosters hands, Much less at thine. Madam know I am Bewford, And for your love do undergo this scorn. Lady. Then for my love let all these quarrels cease, For fear Sir Walter do discover you. Glost. Hadst thou been Servant to the meanest man That breaths in England, being legitimate, I would have born with thee: but thou to brave me, Whose Master I esteem as basely on, As on thy words, I cannot put it up, For Madam know, that howsoere diguis'd My name is Gloster, who holds scornâ Lady. No more, If ever I had interest in your love, Shew it in silence, thats the Cardinal Who comes diguis'd, arm'd with some base resolve To get me hence by forein violence. Glost. Is't possible that this disguise should meet, So just with mine? Lady. 'Tis true, he told me all. Glost. Wo'd we were well rid of his company. Lady. Do you but send away Sir Walter Playnsey, Let me alone to pack the Cardinal. Both. What do you say Sir Walter? Old Playn. There is some hidden secret in this message Which Playnsey founds not, but I'll go to them both. Glost. But Sir I hope you'l go to Gloster first. Card. And why to Gloster first? Glost. 'Cause hee's the better man. Card. He lyes that sayes it. Glost. Were the Cardinal Bewford himself apparell'd in thy cloaths, Draw. I'd cross his pate for giving me the lye. Old Playn. Keep the Kings peace Sir. Glost. Sir Walter, so I will, Yet the worst boy that feeds on Glosters beef, Holds it high scorn to pocket up the lye At ere a Sumners hand that follows Bewford. Card. Thou durst not speak this in another place? Glost. Yes here, or any where to Bewfords face, Even to his teeth, and I would thou wert he. Card. Shall I be brav'd! oh I could tear my flesh, And eat his heart for this disparagement, I fear he knows me, and to work my shame He braves me thus before my Mrs. face, But Bewford with a shower of patience, Lay the rough wind of thy distemper'd thoughts For my vext Soul hath tane a solemn oath Nere to kiss comfort till I be reveng'd. Old Playn. Nay Gentlemen, howsoever private brawls Have set your Lords and Masters at debate, Let my intreats so much prevail with you, As in my house to use no violence, And so I pray rest pleas'd, for ere I sleep I do intend to visit both my Lords. Will't please you to walk along for company? Card. I would, but I must stay an hour or two About some other business in the Town. Glost. About my Love you mean, but Cardinal Heres one will do that business to your hand. Old Playn. Why then farewell to you both. Exit old Playn. Both. Adue Sir Walter Playnsey. Lady. A word with you my good Lord Cardinal, Your Brothers man seems very quarrelsome, And should you both stay, there might grow some jars, Which to prevent, I would intreat your grace To walk before into the Spittle fields. Whilst with good words I send away this Fellow, Which done, I'll chuse my opportunity, And in the absence of Sir Walter Playnsey Get out, and meet you at the Orchard-gate, And there conclude about some stratageme To make you Master of your own desires. Card. Enough sweet Lady: Sirrah Horse-courser, I'll course you one day for your Jadish tricks. Glo. Jades a fit Title for an Alle like thee, That canst not kick, but bear all injury. Manet Glo. &amp; Elle. Come Madam now let's go, the Cardinals mad To lose thee thus, then banish hence all fear, Gloster is on thy side. Exeunt. Enter Canbee and Hadland, and Cardinal. Can.

Had.

Can. And I damb thee not for thy unbelief. Call Canbie Coward (think'st thou) I wo'd have lost this evenings work, but for my Noble, my Princely Lord Cardinal? no. Had. That's some reason indeed, but Prince and Cardinal if thou be, Jack-Hadland swears by the bawl'd Crown of King Carnifax the meeting thy greatness this evening has dampnified our receipts at least six purles. Card. Be what you will be both, only be resolute In any quarrel against Glosters men, And on mine honour I'll reward ye well. Can.

Can. I'll jerk ye for this ye slave. Card. Nay Sirs be Friends, hold ye, here's gold, Do but assist me against Glosters life And I'll reward you better. Had. Cardinal, wert thou Cardinal King of the Infernals, were thou Prince of Grim-tarter-tarmagant and Erebus, I wo'd not shed one drop of the worst Dogs blood my Duke of Gloster keeps, for thy miter, thy million, thy metropolis, shall I betray his life that sav'd me from the death of a Dog? no. Yet for my honest friend Franck Canbees sake, I am content to stand by, and give aym at this time. Enter Gloster and Ellenor. See where he comes two of ye are enough to deal with one, I'll not meddle with him. Card. Let's set upon him all, and kill the slave. Glost. Hast thou betray'd me Coward? Bewford know Though I am over-matcht I am not kill'd. Enter old Playnsey, young Playnsey, Captain West. and Oficers. Old Playn. Keep the Kings peace for shame my Lords. Card. Come Canbee follow me, Playnsey be sure I'll fit upon your skirts for parting us. Glost. Bewford Thou maist befriend him with thy power, Had not he been, thou hadst not breath'd this aire. Card. Gloster thou wrongst me, with-hold'st St. Johnses, Look too't, for fear when I get enterie I pull not down the Castle ore thine ears: Glost. Cardinal to spite thee I'll keep Ellenor, And wed her in St. Johnses make her my Dutches. Card. Thou wilt abuse her with lascivious lust, As once thou didst the Earl of Flanders wife, And make her wretched, hoping in thy love. Glost. Oh! your holiness would have her turn a Nun, Your cloyster-lemmon but she minds thee not; Fellow what ere thou art that tak'st my part There's 20 Crowns, go prove an honest man Card. There's 40 for thee, Canbee, kill that slave As ever thou intend'st my Love to have. Can. I will take my time my Lord. Had. Canbee come not near me, thou knowest my antient order.

I shall be mindfull of thee Canbee: if thou kill him Base slave, had not he been Gloster had dyed? Glost. I am sorry Gentlemen for Momfords fall, And for our Brother the Lord Regents anger, Let him pull down the pride of Winchester, And Gloster easily will be appeas'd. Card. Humphry nor Bedford, nor thy self hath power To make Lord Bewford stoop; dost thou forget, I am a Prince, and a Plantaginet? Glost. Bastards were never Princes in their state. Card. I am a Prince elected by the Pope. Glost. I'll make ye gladly flye to your Elector. Card. First will I see thy death Witless Protector. Draw again. Old Playn. Keep the Kings peace my Lords. Card.

But to the purpose, now Sir Walter Playnsey Take no exceptions as you love our favour, That Lady Ellenor's escap'd away. Old Playn. Is she escap'd away my Lord? Glost. She is, nay storm not, For if you do your anger is in vain, I'll answer any Duty for her wardship. So rest your self content; if ye rest quiet And will confirm your ward to be my wife, I'll send ye within six daies six thousand pound, Being more than you can get by course of Law. Old Playn.

Think upon your Vow, See this sad Lady, when you went to France, You swore at your return to mary her. Y. Playn.

Stro. âAnd have at you too then e'faith. They fight. Can. Hold, as you are a Gentleman hold. Y. Stro. Hold me no holds, I'll have another bout with ye, or I'll make your sconce and the post ring noon together, and sirrah Gypsie you shall fare the worse for one of your Coats sake, that rob'd me of a sattin suite tother night,âand well remembred where's my Cloak Swash? Swash. Your Cloaks a good Cloak, take the wall of my Master ye slave you. Y. Stro. I think the fellow be mad,âwhere's my Cloak man. Swash. Your Cloak's a good Cloak and a fair Cloak, quarrel with my Mr. ye scabs you. Y. Stro. I think the fellow's from pall, I ask thee where my Cloak is. Can. Let not a man pass unsearch'd, the Gentleman shall not lose the worth of a mite in my company. Had. I hope Sir you will not suspect my Boy nor me? Y. Stro. Suspect me no suspects, I am sure my Cloak cannot go without hands, and I'll have it again, or I'll bang it out of the coxcombs of some of them. Can. âSir you mishape lyes as near my heart as it had been mine own, and cause I see 'you a resolute tall Gentleman, and in respect that I was the occasion of this falling out, my Cloak (simpl though it be) cost me 40 French Crowns, take it, it is at your service. Y. Stro. Forty French Crowns, forty French Pins, what dost thou tell me of thy Cloak? I scorn to wear ere a mans Cloak under the Element but mine own: but I'll tell thee what, and it were not for thy sake, whom I think an honest kind fellow and so forth, I'de bang this Bacon fan'd slave orethwart his shanks, he should remember stealing a Cloak to Dooms day, so should he.

Naye Swash yonders my father, say nothing of my Cloak Swash. Enter old Strowd. Old Stro. Well, if I live I'll meet Sir Robert Westford, But first I'll see if I can find my Son, And here he is, is't possible my Lands A Jerkin or Jacket for Srrowd. Should maintain this Attire, you Podigal Where have you got this trash, unto whose Books Are you indebted for it, pardon me Gentlemen For being so sawcy in your company; 'Tis not for a poor Country Yeomans son To flant it out thus. Can. Sir you may say your pleasure, is your Son, but thus much I'll assure you, though if he be your Son the chiefest Gallants in the Land are enamour'd with his good parts and valour. Old Strow. Nay Gentlemen thus much I'll say for him, Hee's a right Norfolk-man mettle, all steel: But I'll not have him use his bravery. The time has been when as a Norfolk yeoman That might dispend 500 marks a year Would wear such cloath as this sheeps russets gray, And for my Son shall pe no President To break those orders, come off with this trash Your bought Gentility, that sits on thee Like Peacock's feathers cock't upon a Raven. Let true born Gentlemen were Gentries robes, And Yeoman Country seeming Liveries. Y. Stro. âYou'd have the Calf with the white face I think, I am sure yonders old Simsons son of Showdam Thorp, that wears his great gall gaskins o'the Swash-fashion, with 8 or 10 gold laces of a side, and yet, without boast be it spoken, you are more in the Kings Books than he, and pay more scot and lot a fair deal, so ye do. Old Stro. He is a desperate Cast-away like thee, And wrongs his fathers credit and his own; The Sons discent's no better than her fathers. Why should their cloaths be richer? I am as proud, And think my self as gallant in this gray, Having my Table furnish't with good Beef. Norfolk temes bread, and Country home bred drink, As he that goeth in ratling Taffity. Let Gentlemen go gallant what care I, I was a Yeoman born, and so I'll dye; Then if thou beest my Son be of my mind, Wast lesse in rags and spend more in thine House, Or if thou hast no House to spend it in Swash. Go to a Bawdy-house Mr. Old Stro. How Knave to a Bawdy-house, no sirrah no give it maim'd Souldiers, and poor helpless Widows. Off with this trash, on with this seemly weed, Be not Strowds shadow but be Strowd indeed. Y. Stro. Come hither Swash there is no remedy, I must give the old man good words and speak him fair, for and if he should die to morrow next (as God forbid but he should) he might defeat me of all his Land. Swash. You say true Master, come on with this Jerkin, so now young Master you look like your self, and like my Masters son. Old Stro. Son what are these that keep you company? Y. Stro. A couple of honest proper Gentlemen they seem to be, but alls one to you, I must keep company with none but a sort of Momes and Hoydons that know not chalk from cheese, and can talk of nothing but how they sell a score of Cow-hides at Lynmarte, and what price Pease and Barley bears at Thetford market. Old Stro. Then still consort thee with these Gentlemen, I like the carriage of them passing well. Y. Stro. I a murren on em they they have carried away my Cloak amongst 'em. Old Stro. But let that pass. Swash. I Sir 'tis past and gon too. Old Stro. And come along with me to Mile end to my Lodging. I must talk a couple of cold words with Sir Robert Westford. Go Swash afore, and saddle my bay Nag, Perhaps I'll ride a mile or two to night: Kind Gentlemen, I am somewhat troublesom To press thus rudely into your company; Come Gentlemen, I'll gratulate your Loves And your kind favours used unto my Son. Ex. Strowds. Can. And we live wee'l make him spend your living, come Jack lets go, where's Snip. Had. Oh Sir at my sweet Boss the Broakers, neer fear it there's a sure Dandeno, she cuts it out in Hose and Jerkins, she is an honest dealer, your privy taker, and your sure concealer. Can. Let's to't and turn again to meet this Gull, Wee'll fleece him and his Bags wee they nere so full. Exeunt. Enter Bess Momford. Bess. Oh hapless, hapless, miserable wretch! To loose my wealth and all my fathers Lands Did never move me; but to see my Uncle Cheat me of all my Jewels, and in spight Even to my face mary my troth-plight Husband To his own Daughter, and to see young Playnsey Embrace another in my promis'd bed, And I thrust out upon the wedding day; Oh this is it that drives me full of woe Into this sad and sollitary Green! Here to do violence unto my self. Momf. My Daughter in dispair, then play thy part, Prevent her ills that did procure her smart, Alas where am I? how shall I return Unto my homely Cabbin? where's my boy? I prethee do not leave me gentle wag, Take pity of my miserable state. Bess. Who talks of pity? now alas good man, What are you blind? Momf. Yes blind, and like to die, Not for my own, but for thy misery. Bess. Father be comforted, I am but poor, Yet time has beenâ sigh. Momf. Oh do not sigh Girl, Grief hath so tyranniz'd upon my heart That if you mourn my tears will bear a part. Bess. You are the man I look for. Momf. I am indeed, And yet thou know'st me not, alas the while That blind deceit, should clear ey'd love beguile, Whence spring thy sorrows from some private wrong. Bess. Am I asleep, or do I know his tongue, Art thou blind sayest thou, let me fee thy face, Oh let me kiss it too, and with my tears Wash off these blemishes which cruel time Have furrow'd in thy cheeks! Oh could thou see, I'de show thine eyes whom thou dost represent. I call'd thee father, I thou shalt be my father, Nor scorn my proffer, were my father here, Hee'd tell thee that his Daughter held him dear: But in his absence Father, thou art he, Shed but one tear for him, and I for thee will weep, till from the moyster of mine eyes A little font of christall tears, shall rise To bathe thine eye lids in, yet do not weep; Lay all thy griefs on me, for I am young, And I have tears enough to weep much wrong. Momf. Wilt thou remain with me, I dare not speak For fear my tongue should my heart's counsel break. Bess. I'le dwell, I'le tend thee, I'le do any thing To do thee good, because within thy looks I see the presence of my reverend Father. Momf. Hast 't lost thy Father then? Bess. Father!

Decide a pins end, do you take her part, Each one you saw did seek to get their own, Why should not I then? shall I undergo Publick displeasure for a pawltry Girl; Shee comes not in myne ears. Cap. West. The more unkind And cruel you, but wherefore should you mary Young Playnsey to your Child, considering He was the troth-plight Husband to your Kins-woman, The much wrong'd Daughter of the down-trod Momford. Sir Rob. Alas for her, does she complain to you, Why and she want a Husband you are a Batcheler, You may do well to take her. Cap. West.

Exeunt. Old Stro. So they are gone, and now Sir Robert Westford. Think of your last nights quarrel. Sir Rob. Tut, tut, nee'r prate, Old Stro.

Momford dissemble, Daughter come forth, and look about this Close, I heard one groan. Enter Bess: Bess. And here's a bloody Coarse. Momf. Look if thou knowst it. Bess. Oh 'tis my Uncle Westford, He that last day with his commanding breath Chid me out of his doors, now breathless lies Intreating me, to give his mingled body A homely entertainment in our Cell. Heaven thou art just, and dreadfull is thy judgement. Momf. Glory not in his Fall, but rather grieve That in his end thou canst him not relieve: Let's bear him in, and if we can by Art Upon thy Foe, we'll work a friendly part: For have he but the smallest sign of breath, We'll recall life, and rescue him from Death. But howsoe're the Body stayes with me, Exeunt with the body. Till Justice points him out that murder'd thee. Enter old Strowd, young Strowd, and Swash. Old Stro.

My Father kill a man,âhere's a jest to mock an Ape withall, what shall become of me now: Swash hie thee to Chenford for the 100 pound, and soon towards Evening Il'e meet thee at Ilford for fear of base Knaves;âI know not whom a man may trust when ones own Father does deceive 'em thus. Ex. Swash. Old Stro. Well Gentlemen I do obey the Law, And yield my body Prisoner to the King, Soon work what means ye can for my repreeve Till we may sue for pardon. So adue my Son, Heaven give thee grace such desperate bralls to shun. Exeunt. Y. Stro. Get a reprieval call you it,âI know no more how to go about it, than I know how to build Pauls-steeple so I do not: but I'le go seek out a Gentleman, one Franck Canby that served the Cardinall, and try what he can do in it; it's an old saying in our Country, it's better to have a friend at Court than a peny in the purse, it shall go hard but I'le save my father from hanging thats certain.

Good Father! gentle Maiden set me down, My wound I fear will freshly bleed again, I prethee let thy Daughter make a bed, I fear my Death-bed, good now send her in. Momf. Daughter I pray go in and make the bed, If we need help I'le call you, pray you begone. Bess. It doth torment him to behold my sight, Well Heaven forgive him and restore his health, He did me more than wrong, and if I see He be at point of death, I'le let him know, That I am Momford's Childe he wronged so. Exit Bess. Sir Rob. Father lend me thy hand now in Heaven's eye Swear to be secret till thou see me dead, Or of this wound by the recovered; Know first I am a Knight, my Name is Westford, My Wife was Sister to the Baron Momford, Ready for a Hangman's will. That Momford left his Daughter to my trust, Which Daughter I have this day turned forth To seek her living, and from her have kept Above ten thousand Marks, besides the Lands Morgag'd unto one Strowd a Norfolk Yeoman, That Strowd on my abuse done to the Lady Challeng'd the field, we fought, and here I fell, He scap't I hope, Heaven grant he may do well. Momf. 'Tis well Sir that you are so penitent. Sir Rob. Oh Father I had need to rend my heart In sunder, with true sorrows hourly sighes, For I have done a deed more impious Than ever entred in the heart of man, If ever thou didst hear of Momfords name, His honor, bounty, and magnificence, If ever thou didst hear his late defame, His accusation, exile, indigence, Then know that I am he, Momford lov'd well, Yet I am he by whom old Momford fell. Momf. Alas Sir! how? Sir Rob. I coveted his Land, And practis'd with Sir Walter Playnsey's Son, An irreligious careless Gentleman; Yet one that will make show, swear and protest, His course of life is equal with the best. O there are many such old man there be, Too many in this Land like him and me; We laid this plot, he should go into France, He did, and serv'd on horse at Amiens, Where he was wilfully ta'n Prisoner, And by his Keepers Daughter understood, The French should by a trecherous plot win Guynes, Wherein Lord Momford held a Garrison. Momf. Who were consenting with the French in this? Sir Rob. A Wallown-Captain called Haute Bewmart. Momf. Did Momford know of it? Sir Rob. No (old man) neverâ But Playnsey counterfeited certain Letters. Subscribing them with Lord Villiers his name, In gratulation for betraying Guynes, These Letters were delivered to a Post, The Post surpriz'd, examin'd where he had them, He answered from Villiers his Secretary: For in his habit Playnsey was disguis'd. Momf. Oh Heaven! Sir Rob. Good father wherefore dost thou sigh? Momf. For grief mens hearts should harbour such deceits. Sir Rob. I faint good father, if thou can relieve me, Call for thy Daughter, stretch me on a bed: Bear witness I repent now, help and ease me, And till I dye conceal my treachery. Momf. Be sure I will, and yet I hope you'll live, And reconcile the banish't Lord your self, For 'twas an unjust fact, indeed it was, Come Daughter help to lead in this Gentleman, Wee'll show him all the favour that we can. Enter Bess. Bess. Father he sownes. Momf. Come quickly help him in, I hope he will recover, but if not, Heaven grant his sins may wholly be forgot. Exeunt Enter Canbee disguised. Can. This damb'd perpetual Rogue Swash, has kept me here in little ease of the bare ground, hungry, cold, and comfortless, ever since two hours afore day. I am hungry for the hundred pound he brings, cold at my heart for fear he come without it, and comfortless least if he have it, he comes with company, but lupus in fabula here he comes, what and alone! excellent the 100 l. myne own then. Enter Swash. Swash. I discover none, the danger is past, I think I may with safety put up an honest weapon, thou terror to all Theeves, sleep there; my young Master promised to meet me, he stayes somewhat long, but he knows Swash is able to stand under the strokes of a dozen false slaves, oh that I could meet with a Theef now to try my valour. Can. Stand sirrah and deliver. Swash. Oh Lord, Theeves, theeves, oh, oh. Can. Peace Villain, or I'le cut out thy Tongue, and make a rasher of the coals on't, deliver the mony. Swash.

Yes faith there was six Theeves set upon me, I very manfully kill'd seven of the six, and the rest carried away the mony, but I shall have it again that's the best on't. Y. Stro. How dost thou know thou shalt ha't again Swash? Swash. Why he has left me his bond here to bring it again. Y. Stro. There's a bond with a Halters name,âSwash is all the mony gone? Swash.

Rob'd, I wod I had been with thee Swash. Swash. I honest Mr. Canbee, and you had been with me I had scaped well enough then. Can. Well, Mr. Strowd, as I was passing through Allgate this morning I saw the Shreeves and Constables set towards to Newgate to fetch your father, the Carpenter in a Cart carried the Jebbet to Bednall-Green, only love to meet you made me neglect the principal business, here's the Protectors Reprieve, I have done the part of a Gentleman, here's Humphry Gloster good Noble man, he loved your Father well, let not your delay dash all, I was two hours by the clock of my bare Knees to the Protector, pray'd the equity of the quarrel, and could Westfords body a been found, the Pardon had been sealed: but haste away with the Repreeve, take horse at Langton, and make speed, or your father will be hanged. Y. Stro. How take horse quoth ye, yes, the Cat would lick her ears and she had 'em, why, I was rob'd too last night my self at Langton. Can. Were you rob'd Mr. Strowd? Y. Stro. Yes faith, they make a matter of nothing to rob Swash and I now adayes, I have not a horse to cast at a dog man not I. Can. Apox of all ill fortunes, hold Sir, there's five shillings left take it, and go take my horse at the Bell at Stratford, and make hast for fear you come too late. Y. Stro. Troth Mr. Canbee, and ye gave me all that ere ye had, I can but thank you, and your horse were a horse of gold, he shall be forth-comming again. Come Swash let us go. Exit Tom Stro: Swash.

Snip. Farewell Swash and be hang'd. Had. âCanbee, art thou mad to give him thy horse, and five shillings to save his father from hanging. Can. No you Friday-fac't-frying pan it was to save us all from whipping, or a worse shame; for let your Rogueship understand, that this reprieve is counterfeit and made by me, your ordinary pasport maker, that should have lost an ear at Salisbury, and another at Northampton; the truth is we must leave London, for if the Protector get us under his protection, we shall all go Westward for this warrant. Had. âLet's turn Gypsies again then, and go about a fortune-telling, 'tis in good request again now. Can. That's the smooth foot path up Holborn, no Iack there's an odde fellow snuffels i'the nose, that shows a motion about Bishops-gate, we'le wheel about by Ratliff and get to his lodging, see shews for a fortnight, till Strowd's nine daies wonder of hanging be past, to let us use his motion, which done the boy shall turn girle, thou as I have done already, wash off that Gypsie-colour, and be doorkeeper with the boy, my self with a half vizzard will describe, and thus we'le live like young Emperors. Had. Canbee I'le chronicle thee for this conceit. Snip thou shalt have good purchase of the Wenches in the throng. Snip. And if I snip not off their Purses then call me crack. Ex. Enter Gloster, Sir Walter Playnsey and his Son, Captain Westford. Enter Old Strowd to the Gallows, with the Hangman, and Officers. Glost. Strowd I am sorry for this heavy fight, And by the dread command of my liege Lord, I come to witness 'twixt the world and you What state you dye in, how yon will dispose Your lands, your goods and debts now forfeited, These he restores thee, yet whilst thou has life To give unto your son, your friends, or wife. Old Stro. I humbly thank his royal Majesty, VVishing long happiness to him and you: But with your favour my good Lord Protector I still deny I am a Murtherer, I kill'd Sir Robert Westford in fair fight; Our quarrel rising from open wrong, He offer'd to his neece the Lady Momford. Glost. All that was certified his Majesty, But prethee hear me Strowd, Death's fleshless hand Clapsing the wretched palms of endless woe, Hath made a circle, and thy soul's the Center, From which by neither power, prayers, or tears, If thou dye desperate she can be freed. Old Stro. My Lord I do beseech ye pardon me, The worl'd believes that I have murder'd Westford, Or since abus'd his body being dead, And shaming at my savage guiltiness, Have hurl'd it in some well not to be found; Is this the matter that I should confess? Glost. It is good Strowd in that make clear thy Soul. Old Stro. He whose pure blood turns scarlet sins to snow. Forgive me all my faults and Westford's death: But if I ever wrong'd him being dead, Or mov'd him from the place whereon he fell, Not far off from this place where I must fall. I ask Heavens anger on me, for his grace, And I can say no more concerning that. Glost. Enough what sayes thou about Momford's lands. Old Stro. I say, seeing the King of his good grace Hath given me all my lands, my debts, and goods, I give too marks, and all the deeds, Unto the Lady Elizabeth his Daughter, And Captain Westford, in whom I put all trust, Be carefull that the Lady be not wrong'd. Cap. West. I warrant you Mr. Strowd. Glost. How mean'st thou to dispose of all thine own? Old Stro. I have a will drawn at my house in Harling, And I confirm that for my Testament. Glost. Are you pleas'd that will shall be perform'd, Old Stro. Heaven's will be done. But I would fain have seen mine unkind Son. Glost. Tarry a little Executioner. Enter Tom Strowd, and Swash. Y. Stro. Hold, hold, hold, let him alone you cross legg'd-hartichoak, touch him and thou dare. Swash. Hold Hangman and thou be'st a man, hold for the Kings advantage. Glost. What are these trow? Y. Stro. Two Sir that come not without their cards I hope; Father you have a simple fellow to your Son you see, come who's the shreeve here haw. Old Playn. I do supply his place. Y. Stro. Do ye so, then here's a Mittimus to repreeve my father back again to the Gaol, or a repreeval what do you call it, it's my Lord Cardinal's, and my Lord Protectors own hands, and seals; I assure you Sir. Glost. Proud Winchesters and mine, that's strange, let's see it. Swash. It is not so strange as true Sir, there it is. Glost. Is this your Son Strowd? Old Stro. I my gracious Lord. Y. Stro. 'Tis the more shame for my Mother else. Glost. Where had you this repreeve? Y. Stro. Of an honest Gentleman Sir, one that can do any reasonable matter with my Lord Protector. Swash. I truly Sir he is one, as honest a Gentleman as Canbee. Glost. It may be so, for I know one Franck Canbee, He serv'd sometimes Bewford the Cardinal, The commonst cosening Knave in all this Land. Swash. I, I that's he Sir, that's he. Y. Stro. As God mend me 'tis the very same man, but all's one for that, he has plaid the kind Gentleman with me, and as God save me, and Swash had not been rob'd this morning of 100 pound, I had paid him well for his pains too Sir. Glost. Strowd turn your self to Heaven these hopes are vain, And young Strowd as you hope to have our favour After your Father's death, I charge you seek That Canbee forth that forg'd you this repreeve. Y. Stro. How after my father's death,âI hope it is not come to that now? after all this charge. Old Stro. Sirrah you, ever chuse yon such sure Mates, My Lord Protector pray be good to him. Y. Stro. Nay pray you my Lord be good to my father, and turn him 'ore the Ladder. Swash. âis this my Lord Erector? Y. Stro. How's that my Lord Protector, and you be my Lord Protector, I pray do but set your hand to this Bill, and as God save me, and ere ye come into Norfolk, I'le do you twenty times as good a turn as the hanging of my father comes to, pray you my Lord. Swash. Do my good Lord Erector, and Swash and his Buckler shall be at your service. Old Stro. Peace, peace, your idle prate, Heaven's peace Must be my comfort in adversity. Y. Stro. Swash what shall become of me now, I nere dare go down into Norfolk again, every clown will brave me, and bid me go to London, and be hang'd as my father was. Swash. I, and they'll bid Swash swing in an Halter as his old Master did. Enter old Momford lead in by Bess Momford. Momf. Some good man bring me to an Officer. It may be a blind wretch may save a subject. Swash. Master, here's a blind man come to see your father hang'd. Y. Stro. How a blind man see him hang'd? that were strange indeed Swash. Old Playn. What would that aged man, and that fair Maid? Swash. I hope she comes to beg my old Master from the Gallows. Y. Stro. No Swash She should have come in her Smock, and then aâ Swash. It may be it is not clean Master. Momf. I heard the people murmur near my house, A little Cottage yonder on the Green, That there was come an antient man to die, For killing of a Knight last afternoon, If it be so, the Knight lives, and no doubt Will be recovered of his dangerous wounds. Glost. Where is he father? Momf. Yonder in my Cottage. Swash. O brave, Master he sayes the Knight's in his God-piece. Y. Stro. No in his Cottage man, thou mistakest. Momf. He nam'd himself but now, and sent us forth, To know the truth, and he comes after us, As well as his green wounds will give him leave. Y. Stro. I marry Swash, here's a good old man, and a goodly Mother, brings news for the nonce,âI wo'd not for all the Bullocks in Norfolk, th'ad faln out, that my father had faln off. Glost. Let Strowd come down, I hope Sir Robert lives, And if he do, believe me I'le reprove This over rash proceedings for Strowd's death. Old Playn. May it please your grace, 'twas Sessions the last day, Strowd granted he had kill'd him, Judgement past, And my Sons wife the Daughter to Sir Robert, Hasten'd (with tears) the execution. Enter Sir Robert Westford. Swash. Yonder he comes Master, come you had like to made a fine piece of work here, are you a Knight and can fight no better. Sir Rob. Health to my gracious Lord the Duke of Gloster. Glost. I am glad Sir Robert Westford of your health, How do you feel your wounds? Sir Rob. May it please your grace, I hope they will do well, This good old man, and this fair-comming Maid, Next under Heaven preserv'd me from death. Glost. Be thankfull to them then, and hear ye young Strowd, Consider this poor man, and that fair Maid. Y. Stro. Consider her,âI consider well enough, sirrah Swash methinks it is the prettiest Mother that ere man's eyes look't on. Glost. Sir Walter Playnsey take Strowd to your house, His pardon shall be sent you ere you dine, So upon Sureties let him be discharg'd, But hear you young Strowd, see you find out Canbee, Or at my hands never expect a favour. Y. Stro. Yes my Lord I'le find him or it shall go hard, vesdiness Swash I am mightily smitten in love with yonder Mother, and I ha not a swelling burning feavour, in every member wo'd I might nere stir,âyonders Mr. Playnsey has all the talk with her, and yet hee's no Batchelar. Swash. Cannot you go and take her away from him, I co'd do it my self Master. Y. Stro. Ile go to 'em, I'le try, Goddeen to your Sir. Swash. Pish you are no body Master, let me alone I have a device to get him away, and then do you sease upon the Wench: follow me Master. Y. Stro. Oh brave Swash e'faith. Enter a Messenger. Glost. Now Sir your news? Mess. The haughty Cardinal Taking advantage of your being from home, Hath with a crue of his Confederates, Beset St. Johnses, and with all his force Assayls to wrong the Lady Ellenor, And steal her forth the Castle. Glost. Is't possible, that this proud Priest dares offer violence Unto my Troth-plight Ellenor? Mess. 'Tis too true my Lord. Glost. Where is he now? Mess. Rid to the Court my Lord. Glost. And thither Gloster doth intend to fly, As swift as quickest speed will give him leave. Ex. Glost. Old Stro. Come Sir you'll seek those Cozeners, No doubt those copes-mates had my 100 pound, And do you hear, take your companion with you, Go and seek them, or for your own part never see my face: But as for you that trust to every slave, Wasting my goods, nay jesting out my life, By false repreeves, and such base practises, Walk, pack, sink, swim, pine, perish, look not on me, Till you have found those that have Cony-catch't you. Y. Stro. Heark hither Swash, and it had not been for a blemish to the name of the Strowds, wo'd we had made an end of this brawling at the Gallows, and then thou should'st a seen whether I wo'd a kept such a coyl for a little pawltry loss or no, I warrant thee he ha not the honesty, to cast thee a Noble towards the healing of thy crack't Crown, yet every one sayes he gave that ill-fac't knave the Hangman five, or six pound. Swash. I that was to buy him a better face Mr. But give him good words, you know the old man is kind enough. Y. Stro. I as any Corssen creature, hee's won with a Apple, and lost again with a nut, but come Swash we'll go seek out those Cony-catchers, and ere I catch them,âI'le make them pay soundly all for their roguery. Exeunt young Strowd and Swash. Old Playn. Sir Robert will you shake hands with Mr. Strowd. Sir Rob.

Oh Uncle have patience. Sir Rob. You are an Agent for the Child of Momford, I pray you Sir Walter Playnsey make good Bonds, That Strowd abuse me not, look to't I pray. Old Playn. I warrant you Sir Robert I'le be sure Of such security as you shall like. Old Stro. Come Captain Westford, you shall have the Deeds Concerning Momford's lands past unto you. Cap. West. I had rather Sir you kept them in your hand. Old Stro. Well as you please, yet walk with us I pray, You brought me to the Gallows, bring me back: Father farewell, farewell good gentle maid, I'le rest your Debtor till some other time; But 'twas Sir Robert's kindness to reveal his name, Else Hangman you had had this home-spun suit, But Heaven be thank't I keep it for my Son, I hope to driue him from his silken humour. Cap. West. Come good Mr. Strowd will you go? Old Stro. Gallows farewell, Strowd's heart is blithe and bold, Having escap'd thy danger being thus old. Exeunt old Strowd, Cap. Westford, and old Playnsey. Sir Rob. A plague of this blind slave, and that base drab, Else hadst thou hang'd ere I had been discover'd, And on my tongue a mischief, that reveal'd Our purpose in the plot of Momfords fall, But I ha't now, I am resolv'd, hear you Son Playnsey, I pray you give that Maid a mark in gold, And Father I must crave a word with thee. Y. Playn. Fair Maid besides his offer take this Gold, Bess. I pray you pardon me, for all the world I would not do my soul that injury. Y. Playn. Divine immortal, all my Souls delight. Bess. Salute me not with such vain Epithite. I am wretched, mortal, miserable, poor, But howsoever base, I'le be no whore. Y. Playn. Wilt thou be then my wife, for she is dead. Bess. It's much unlike, A Gentleman of your worth will vouchsafe, A Beggars Daughter to your Bridal bed. Y. Playn. By Heaven I will if thou wilt grant me love. I'le answer you another time kind Sir. My father hath no Nurse, no Wife, no childe, No servant but my self, and he is blind. Y. Playn. Heark in thine ear one word. Sir Rob. I, I, I, I do remember such a tale I told thee, Come hither good son Playnsey thou shalt hear it. Last night at my first dressing I was Lunatick, Mad that I was hurt, more than of the hurt, And in my ravening fit told this old fool, That thou and I did practise Momford's fall, Now this old Asse believing I said true, Comes with my Conscience, bids me advise, And goes about to make a matter on't, Ha, ha, old fool go, go, go to thy prayers, Thou hadst need of eyes to keep thy Daughter honest. I guess thy cottage be a brothell house, Talk'st thou of Momfords fall and of my madness Momf. I do beseech ye hear me for Heaven's sake. Sir Rob. Tut, tut, do not tell me of Heaven, or Hell, Prate not, I'le send the now and then a peny, But if thou tittle tattle tales of me, I'le clap thee by the heels, and whip thy Daughter, Turn thee to the wide world, and let thee starve. Come come son Plainsey let the Knave alone, Keep's tongue, and keep his friend, else he gets none. Bess. My Father Sir had pity of your wounds. Sir Rob. Peace Huswife. I have paid him for his pains. Come son away, and old man hold your tongue, Remember this old saw, As men are friended, Ex. Sir Rob. and Y. Playn. So either right or wrong their sutes are ended. Momf. Oh miserable age! Bess. Oh wretched youth! Momf. Oh times corrupt by men for want of truth! Bess. What ailes my father? Momf. Why exclaims my Daughter? Bess. Playnsey the perjur'd, he that did deride me, He that did marry Westford's only Daughter, Courts me again to be his Concubine. Momf. Does he then know thee? Bess. He makes show he doth not. Momf. Oh do not trust him Girl, Westford and he Are all compos'd of guile and subtilty. Alas that this fair world, by sin deform'd, Should bear upon her bosome such a shape As Westford is; last night expecting death, Terror dwelt on his heart, which forc'd him tell With tears and lamentations his foul facts, No sooner had he any hope of health, But he conspir'd the faultless death of Strowd, And would not have come forth, had not we been, But till the man had dy'd kept close within. Now he denies a deed as clear as day, Threatens poor want, and low-trod poverty Must not resist men in authority; Come lead me in, I would my daies were done, Since vice layes baits which vertue cannot shun. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Tom Strowd and Swash. Y. Stro. How's this, shall I see all Norwitch in the corner of a little Chamber? I had as lieve thou hadst told me Charing cross stood in Cheapside, and all one. Swash. And you will not believe me you shall see it your self, 'tis in this house, 'tis called a motion: there's first the Master of the motion, then the Master's Mate, the Mate's Consort, the Consort's Cabin-fellow, the Cabin-fellows Hangby, the Hangby's Man, the Man's Boy, the Boy's Page, the Page's Wench, and all these live upon the motion. Y. Stro. This is old excellent y'faith; come, and I had but one cross in the world to bless me with I'de see it; go you afore Swash and shew me thither. Enter Snip like a Wench drest up. Swash. Do you see yon Wench Master? she is Door-keeper, I have given her earnest to enter her soberly, and pass through her quarters at my pleasure. Y. Stro. Is this she? how now pretty Mother? what Gamballs hast ta? canst thou describe them? sen ye? Snip. Not I Sir, the Master of the Motion can Sir. Y. Stro. Go call him out then,âWhat's he? is he asham'd to shew his face trow? or is it the fashion trow ye? what Gamballs have ye here now? ha? Enter Canbee and Hadland disguised. Can. Why This is Strowd that I fetc'd over with the counterfeit Repreeve, but 'tis no matter, wee'll out-face him. Gentlemen the first conceit you are to see is Tumbling. Y. Stro. Stumbling, What stumbling? I think the fellow be straught. Had. Sir he means Tumbling, and feats of Activity. Y. Stro. Why man that's as stale as Bancks curtal, there were a sort of Tumblers at Windham fair last week, and they have made that so stale In Norfolk and Suffolk, that every wench is turn'd Tumbler, and ye ha no better matters ye lose my custome I can tell ye Sirs. Can. You shall likewise see the famous City of Norwitch, and the stabbing of Julius CÃ¦sar in the French Capitol by a sort of Dutch Mesapotamians. Y. Stro. How the French Capitol! nay I remember Tully's Offices sayes the Capitol that CÃ¦sar was stab'd in was at Rome. Can. Impute the gross mistake to the fault of the Author; you shall likewise see the amorous conceits and Love songs betwixt Captain Pod of Py-corner, and Mrs. Rump of Ram-alley, never described before. Swash. Good Master let's see Mrs. Rump of Ram-alley. Y. Stro. How? Captain Pod and Mrs. Rump?âI think this snufling slave flouts us; then y'faith let's see the sawing of the Devil with a wooden saw. Can. Or if it please you shall see a stately combate betwixt Tamberlayn the Great, and the Duke of Guyso the less, perform'd on the Olympick Hills in France. Y. Stro. France?âThou speakest all French to me; but off with this snuffling French Mask, and speak in your English voyce, or as God sa me I'll beat thy nostrils as flat as a pancake, or a barly froyes. Had. Alas Sir, the Gentleman has got a mischance lately, and broke his Brow, that makes him wear a Visard. Y. Stro. Dost tell me on his Brow? what car'd I and he had broke his Neck, I'll have it off; what are you the Master of the Motion? âI am glad I know it; Swash look thee here's Canby that cosen'd me with the false Repreeve. Swash. And here's the slave Snip that ran away with your Sword in a Wenches Petticoat; we'll spoyle your motion now we have ye. Had. I beseech you good Master Swash. Swash. What Gypsie? are you turn'd Jugler? I'll tickle you. Can. Heark ye Mr. Strowd. Had. Mr. Swash as you ever came of a womanâ Swash. Let me never come off a woman while I live again if I do not terrifie you, I'll motion you, I'll murther your Tamberlayn and his Coatch-horses, I'll stab your CÃ¦sar, I'll ravish your Rump, I'll peper your Pod, I'll powder your Motion, your Norwitch shall down, I am fire, and I'll consume your Motion in a twinkling. Exit with Snip. Y. Stro. Do Swash, and let me alone with these till thou come again. Had. Mr. Stro. For mine own part I protest unto you I love you as dear as the heart in my bosom, and protest unto you it went to the very soul of me to hear how that slave Canbee, like a Gypsy, cosen'd you of a sattin suit. Y. Stro. How? how's this, was he the Gypsie that cosen'd me of my suit? Can. Jack y'are a Gypsie; believe him not Mr. Strowd, he has been prov'd perjur'd, the slave will fight with his own Father for a Jack of Beer, and kill a sucking Infant for a pint of Wine, and where he sayes I cosen'd you of your suit, 'twas his damn'd counsell that Swash was rob'd yesterday of the 100 l. Had. Mr. Strowd, by this hollow tooth that shall tear that slaves Nose like a piece of Swines flesh, 'twas he that rob'd him, and counterfeited the Repreeve; indeed I must confess I had my share; some I have spent, the rest is here, take it Mr. Strowd, and think of honest Jack Hadland as he deserves. Can. I must give him some to; Mr. Strowd there's 20 l. towards your losses, because I would not have my reputation come in question afore the Protector, nor seem to stain my Lord Cardinal's cloath; there should be an old Harry Angel amongst it, lend it me to swear by a little. Y. Stro. Not one of them and there were a hundred of 'em. Can. Let me be torn into mammocks with wilde Bears if I make not a gallemaufry of thy heart, and keep thy Skull for my quaffing bowl you base cheating Slave. Y. Stro. âHere's the old Proverb right, When false Theeves fall out, true men come to their own; but say I should take this 40 l. in part of payment, what security shall I have to get the rest? for my Father has vow'd nere to take me for his Son, till I get his mony again, or see you at the Gallows. Can. Are you faln out with your father? fall in with us helter shelter, you shall fare no worse than we do. Y. Stro. âMan, what wouldst thou have me to turn Cony-catcher? Can. Oh Sir, your only bravest life that can be. Y. Stro. âI think it were not amiss, for I ha seen Wheat and Barley grow amongst cockell and darnell, and many an honest man keep Knaves company; How now Swash, what hast thou done? Enter Swash and Snip. Swash. I have confounded their Motion, beleaguer'd their Castle, batter'd down the Walls, and taken Tamberlayn the blood, Prisoner in a pursute, to the utter undoing of all Motion-Monger and Puppit-players. Y. Stro. 'Tis well done Swash, but wotts thou what man? I am turn'd Cony-catcher since thou wentst. Swash. Cony-catcher? the Devill you are? Y. Stro. Yes y'faith Swash, and if thou wou't do one thing for me now, I'll teach thee to conycatch too when I come into Norfolk. Swash. On that condition Master I'll do it what ere it be. Y. Stro. Do but go thy waies to Mile-end-Green to my fathers lodging at the 3 Colts, &amp; do but tell him I cannot find these fellows yet, but as soon as I do meet with them, tell him he shal hear from me. Swash. Yes Sir, I'll go tell him you are with 'em, but you bid me say you could not find 'em. Y. Stro. âBy no means Swash, then thou marr'st all, tell him I cannot find 'em, make a lye for me now, I'll make two for thee another time. Swash. Well on this condition you'll teach me to cony, I am content to lye for you. Ex. Swash. Y. Stro. Do so; Now Sirs, what course will you take, that I may come by the rest of my mony? Can. Tush we have 100 l. tricks when we want cash one amongst us undertakes the name and habit of some swashing Italian or French Noble-man at least, the rest in Liveries attending, then we come and sojourn at some honest Gentlemans house, till we have eat him out of house and home in diet, and wore his credit out at elbows with taking up commodities at his Merchants, in hope to have all his mony at a day, before which day we give him the slip, and to escape pursute attire our selves like Gypsies, Pedlars, Tinkers, or such like disguise; how like you this? Y. Stro. This is old excellent y'faith; well I see I might a kept company with honest men all the daies a my life ere I should a learn'd half this Knavery: but heark my Masters, yonder's the Blind-Beggar of Bednall-Green has the prettiest Mother to his Daughter as a man need to lay his leg over, now if all the wit in your heads can but get her to be my wife, I sho'd think my mony every penny better bestowed than other. Can. You shall have Sir her. Y. Stro. Shall, why well said; come then my mad Viragoes I have spent many a gray groat of honest swaggerers, and tear-Plackets in my daies that I never drunk for, and now I'll turn swaggerer my self, I'll keep you company and't be but to keep you honest, true men I cannot, for there's nere a finger on your hands but is as bad as a lime twig, I'll do my good will, and I can bring ye to any goodness, then say God a mercy honest Tom Strowd of Harling. Can. Thou shalt be our chief Captain amongst us. Y. Stro. How your Captain?âI'll make all split then, come my hearts. Exeunt. Enter old Momford and sits down, to him Bess Momford. Bess. Father, dear father succour me from shame, Young Mr. Playnsey is entered our house, Hath shut the fore-door up, detains the keys, And swears to kill me, if I do not yield To his abhorrid and intemperate lust, Help me good father o're the Garden pale, That I may call for succour on the Green. Momf. No Daughter, sit thee down, sit down by me, I call you Daughter, being your own desire, If you be nobly born as you report, Why should you to escape your own distress Leave me poor man alone, and comfortless? Enter Y. Playn. Bess. He comes! Momf. Let him, sit down, sit down I say. Bess. O how shall I escape reproach this day? Momf. Peace, heaven may give my byzon'd eyes their light, Stretching these crooked limbs strait and upright. Y. Playn. Art thou fled hither? thinkest thou his weak strength Can free thee? come, why should this frosty ice Clasp his cold arms about thy flowring spring? Nay strive not Bayard, if ye do, by Heaven I'll draw my Rapier, and with one thrust Send thee to Charon as a Passenger: Momf. Oh, I am feeble, pray ye hurt me not, If it be true, as I have heard it told You maried lately with Sir Robert's Daughter. Y. Playn. Father, I hate her, and she scorneth me, She pules, she sighs, she pines, she leaves her meat, She flies my Bridal-bed, she bans, she raves That ere her father forc'd her to be mine. Bess. Good Sir comfort her. Y. Playn. Comfort thou me, and I will comfort her. Bess. I will not yield consent to such a sin, I scorn to be a Princes Concubine. Y. Playn. Wilt thou be then my wife? Bess. No, I have sworn To dye as pure a Maid as I was born. Momf. How can she be your Wife? Y. Stro. My wife will die. Momf. Tarry that time. Y. Playn. All lingering I defie. Old man I'll make thee happy by thy grant; Fair Maid thou shalt be blest in thy consent; Deny me and I'll turn a Tereus, Murder thy Father, then cut out thy tongue, Deform thy beauty with the hand of wrath, Lastly make spoyl of thy Virginity, Then leave thee wretched; where if now thou yield, 'Gainst all reproach and wrong I'll be thy shield. Bess. Help me good Father. Y. Playn. Bid a sere dry'd Reed Oppose his sapless strength 'gainst a green Oak. See me, I am all youth, all love, all beauty, Thou beautious, lovely, youthfull, 'tis thy duty To love thy like, which duty if thou shun, My hate thy beautious youth shall overturn. Momf. Good Sir stand but aside a little while; I do remember since my self was young The strong effects of lust; both she and I Must yield to your desire. Bess. I'll rather dye. Momf. Nay say not so, listen to me my Child. Y. Playn. I marry father if thou canst perswade her I'll make thee rich, and one day mary her. Momf. Fear nothing Child, but use him gently, And I will fit his hot lust presently. Y. Playn. Come, what resolve you? either yield or dye. Momf. Sir I commit my Daughter to your hands, But I beseech you woo her with fair words, She may without compulsion yield at last; I'll in and weep, for what can I do more? You're rich and strong, and I am week and poor. Y. Playn. Hold Father, take that Gold to comfort thee. Momf. For mony few men now shun infamy. Bess. Oh me, do you forsake me! Momf. I a while I do, But Playnsey I'll anon be even with you. Ex. Momf. Y. Playn. Now prettie Virgin how are you resolv'd? Bess. I yield, yet though I yield I bend my knees, And ere my spotless Virgin shape I leese Kneels. Let me delate the many miseriesâ Y. Playn. Come do not stain thy lilly cheeks with tears, Nor fashion to thy self a form of dread, Thou talk'st of loss of shape, a fair Lass bears A shape as goodly in lost Maiden-head, And far more lovely; then with smiling grace, They boldly look upon a Lovers face, Try once, then be assur'd thoul't not refuse, Hadst thou a hundred Maiden-heads to lose. Bess. Impious temptation! I defie thee Playnsey, Setting my weak strength to resist thy lust; Off with thy poysonous hands, help, help me Heaven. Enter Momford like a Serving-man. Momf. But a poor earthly man guided by Heaven Will keep thee from this deed, hatefull as Hell; Playnsey forbear as thou respects thy life. Y. Playn. Thou Autum-shaken leaf, thou bare Anatomie, Thou wither'd Elder-pith, thou shape of death, Sent by that blind exorcist to disturb The pleasures that young Playnsey's heart affects, Vanish, I know thou art but lither Ayr, Thy hand fell lightly on me like thin smoak That is disperc'st amongst the spreading clowds. Momf. What mak'st thou me a Ghost? come take thy weapons, Thou shalt soon try I am both flesh and bone. Fight, Playnsey is down. Y. Playn: Hold Villain hold! Momf. No Boy, I am a Man, Uncle to that wrong'd Maid, the Blind-mans brother, Who quaking sits within mourning his Child; Ar't not asham'd? no thou art impudent, Westford and you are flesh't in villanies; Think on your plot about the banish'd Momford, If you'll repent it I will use you well; Make means that Momford may be proved clear, As you know best his harmless innocence, And on a Souldiers word I do protest Momford shall make your peace, and sue your pardon. Y. Playn. What dost thou mean? what's this thou talk'st to me? Momf. I talk of Treason, rapine, slander, wrong; Go get thee to Sir Robert, hee's hard by, I saw him walking up along the Green; Stand not to talk, if thou accept my offer I'll be a faithfull servant in this business, Preserve your credits, and confer with you; If not, resolve on this, I'll to the King, And there accuse you of this haynous wrong. Y. Playn. Wilt thou stay here untill I fetch Sir Robert? Momf. I will. Go Maid, help the old man to bed, Ex. Pl. Hee's shrowdly frighted by this violence. Bess. What reverend man art thou? or Angel rather, That speak'st these wonders of my banish'd father? Momf. Go honorable Maiden, Momford's Heir, A little help the old weak blinded man, That weeping sits within, trembling for dread Lest Playnsey had thy chast youth injured, Help him, and then I'll tell thee many wonders. Bess. To hear but one word of my fathers weal, I'll undergo all work, all pain, all toyl. Ex. Bess. Momf. Poor Girl, how glad she is to hear the voyce Of Momford's honor? with what nimble speed She hyes to help a shadow, there's no beggar, No poor blind man, that wants her comforting; I wonder what she'll think, when she shall find Only a staff, a scrip, a gown, a bonnet, And nere a body to make use of them? Enter Bess. She comes, and is amazed as she comes. Bess. Where is the blind man I beseech you Sir? Alone I find his garments in his Chair, Do not amaze me, tell me where he is? Momf. He is within fair Maid. Bess. Aged man, I should give credit to your milk-white hairs; Tell me, O tell me, why within a Chair The case is left; are you a Conjuror, Where is the blind man that I call'd my father? Momf. I am no Conjuror, stay here but a while, And I will bring the blind-man to thy sight, Stay here, look on this clowdy Element, And I'll produce him to your hearts content. Ex. Momf. Bess. Alas where am I! sure this Beggars Cell Is a base Cottage to betray my honor; I took him at the first to be a Comforter, But now I see he is expert in shapes: But why should I dispraise him? he did free My body from vild Playnsey's luxury. Methinks he has been all my Joy to me, Why should there now arise this difference? Enter Momford like a Beggar. Momf. Daughter where are you? Bess. Pray where is your brother? Momf. I have no Brother, no kin but one Daughter. Bess. Hee's an inchanter sure, his waies I'll shun. Momf. Daughter where are you? I conjure you Child By the true honor of old Momford's name, By Momford's faith, that was by fraud exil'd, You would not let his honor die in shame. Bess. Help me ye powers, that give all Mortals power, To scape this heavy and too troublous hour. Spirit avoid me, or if thou be no spirit Surely it is a damn'd Magicion. Fly me, thou alter'st shapes, I do not love thee. Momf. Thou dost; see here the Gold thou sent'st thy father, When I, even I my self brought these fair Arms To wicked Westford's Gate; poor Child be not amaz'd, I am thy Father Momford, by trayterous practise banished. Bess. Ah me, that I have liv'd so long unknown, I still had such a hope. Mom. Fair Child forbear, I know Sir Robert Westford, and this Playnsey, Or one of them at least, will come forthwith; Say you the blind man is in his bed sick, And call me Uncle; come, be comforted, Our sum of honor in despight of guile Shall brightly shine in England's Hemisphere, We have been clowded long, but mauger hate, Truth will advance desert to honor's state. Exeunt. Enter Sir Robert Westford, Y. Playnsey, Canbee, Hadland, and Tom Strowd. Y. Playn. Dare you trust Strowd in this same stratagem? Can. Tush fear him not, since his father hath given him over, he hath given o're all honesty and lives upon the spoyl; come ye mad Rogues here's three of us, and here's 30 l. each man take his share, and with his share his charge; We are all for this mony to cut the throat of the Blind-beggar, his Brother, and his Daughter. Y. Stro. How? cut their Throats?âI'll see ye hang'd first. Can. Jack thou and I will keep quarter at this end of the Green, and Waylay the old spruce Serving-man, he shall be our share, and Tom Strowd thou shalt ly at this corner for the wench, for this way she comes unto the Conduit-head for water, she falls to thee. Had. And fall thou to her, and ye can but agree of price. Y. Stro. Nay let me alone for falling upon the Wench I warrant ye. Can. Mr. Playnsey and Sir Robert do you keep about the old Mans Cottage, and when you see his Daughter gone knock out his Brains with his Crutches; thus have you heard your several charges; every man to his Court of Guard, and keep fair quarter. Sir Rob. Plotted with good discretion; Son Playnsey I like it well, that you and I go walk Near to this Cottage, for it much concerns us To see this Beggar dead, upon whose breath Proud slander sits to blemish our good names, And blast our honest reputations; Shake hands and part in hope when next we meet, Ex. Sir Rob. &amp; Can. &amp; Had. Their deaths shall lay all danger at our feet. Y. Playn. Pray heaven it may; a word good Mr. Strowd. Although you had in charge to kill the Maid, I do intreat you use some special care In your attempt, and in the stead of death Tell her I love her dearly, and that love Enforc'd this shift: for though the Wench be poor, Yet in the glass of my affection She seems right wealthy, fair and vertuous; Commend me to her Strowd, and since my wife Hath given her latest farewell to the world, Ready Swash. Tell her I do intend to mary her; Mean time convey her to my farm at Rederiff, And there's 10 Angels more for thy reward: But be as trusty to me, as the thought That sleeps within my bosome, so adue, I trust the richest of my hopes with you. Ex. Playn. Y. Stro. Do so, and I do not deceive you let me dye like a Dog on a Pitch-fork;âThis is excellent, hire me to steal away the Wench I am in love withall my self, this comes just in the nick yfaith, I desire no more, but to meet her. Whose yonder Swash? how now? whither away so fast Swash ha? Enter Swash. Swash. What my young Master? why I am going to the three Colts to saddle your Fathers Gelding; we both ride into Norfolk this afternoon. Y. Stro. âBetter and better still, thou com'st as fit for the purpose as a Pudding for a Fryers mouth, so dost thou: I do but stay here to talk 3 or 4 cold words in hugger-mugger with the Blind-beggars Daughter, and I'll ride down into Norfolk with you; and as God wo'd ha't, yonder comes the Mother. Enter Bess Momford. Bess. Oh what content attends this Country life? Here proud Ambition's emulating eye Playes not the find-fault; our thatch'd-shed is built Without the reach of Treasons bloody Gripe. Swash. To her Master; 'tis an old saying in our Country, Long Standers are but short Doers, Wenches cannot away with them. Y. Stro. Mass Swash I think thou sayst true; I'll to her, How now pretty Mother, whither are you going so fast? Bess. Alas good Sir I am a poor man's Child, My Father is the Beggar of this Green, That ives upon good peoples charities, I am agoing with this earthen Pitcher To fetch clean water from the Conduit-head; VVe eat the herbs that grow on the Springs brinck, And count the Conduit-water wholsom drink. Y. Stro. Nay you drink water you are no hostess for me: Swash. You are no hostess for me, fie, fie, I am ashamed of you. Y. Stro. Why? what should I say to her? Swash. VVhat? you should have prais'd her little foot, Her hansome shooe belonging to't: And then a come to her round knee, And then Master to her belly. Y. Stro. I marry Swash, and I were there once I'de do well enough: but pray, thee let me alone, I'll talk to her well enough I warrant thee; this is to the purpose, VVench you know young Mr. Playnsey? Bess. I do remember I have seen the man, He loves my Father well; why names he Playnsey? I hope he'ill do me no more injury? Swash. Fie, fie, what have you to do with Playnsey? come to your own business; as thus you must come upon her, Oh Lady bright, pity this Knight, that in this plight is thus tormented, if you be willing, to be billing, I dare hold a shilling you shall be contented. Y. Stro. I marry Swash, this is excellent yfaith; could'st not thou a taught me this? but all's one Swash, I'll win her without these Ballads I warrant you; VVell wench, to come to the point, there's young Playnsey loves you well, and he has hired me to watch for thee here, and carry thee to his Farm house at Rederiff, where if he find thee, soon at night thou art like to lose thy Maiden-head afore morning. Bess. Unhappy wretch, that Playnsey sure was born To make our House and Family a scorn. Swash. Shee begins to yield Master, give her not o're, to her again Master. Y. Stro. I warrant thee Swash now I am in let me alone. VVell VVench, this is the plain English on't, and thou lovest me no worse than I love thee, instead of carrying thee to his Farm-house at Rederiff, I'll ha thee to the Church and mary thee, and of a poor Beggars Daughter, I'll make thee a wealthy Norfolk Yeomans wife; what sayest thou to it now sen ye? Bess. Alas my Father is a poor Blind-man, And I am all the comfort that he has, I am his eyes to see, his feet to go, And hands to dress him, I being gone hee's left Eyeless, handless, footless, comfortless, Yet if you love me as you make a show, Come to our Cottage: though our State be poor, We live content and that's a good mans store, Y. Stro. Lay thee Swash, I must go into her Cot-house she says; Well VVench, and thou wot not go with me, thou art ne're like to see thy Father, nor his Shed more, for Mr. Playnsey and Sir Robert Westford has hired a couple of false Knaves to cut thy fathers throat, therefore and thou canst love me, say, and hold, go thou with Swash and raise the Town, and I'll go back and save thy Father's life I warrant thee. Bess. I'll go with ye, love ye, I'll do any thing so thou wilt save my aged Fathers life. Y. Stro. âLet me be hang'd like a Dog and I do not; Swash go you with her and raise the Town, I'll but cross o're the Summer lay by the Broom field o're goodman Dawson's Close and be with you presently;âwhither art thou going? thou dost not hear me. Swash. Yes, yes, I must go by the Broom-field, I hear you Sir, come VVench come. Y. Stro. Nay since you are so forward hold, take you the Pitcher, I'll go with her my self,âI wod not for anything but I had turn'd Cony-catcher, here had been a black day with some body else; come VVench, dry thine eyes, never cry for the matter, the worst is past, thou shalt see the case altered I warrant thee, I'll save thy Father's life fear not. Swash. Oh, oh, oh, I carry the Pitcher! there let it lye, I'll after them. Exeunt. Enter Momford driving in Canbee and Hadland. Can. âI am hurt. Had. Hold, and thou com'st of the noble blood of the Trojans hold. Momf. Nay do not think you desperate Cast-aways, Though time hath hid me with the rynd of Age, And hung his snowy livery of my face, Though I am old, that I want strength to fight; If you be men whose fortune's has been shak'd By the rough arm of want, or Servitors That have consum'd your living in the wars, I have a poor blind Brother on this Green, Who by the Alms of charitable men, And with the wealth I brought him out of France, Hath store of Gold, and had you shown your wants To him or meâ Can. I scorn to make my state known to e're a prowling Beggar on ye all, we know your Brother has Gold, and 'tis that we come for. Had. And we'll ha't or dye for't. Both. Murther, help, help. They fight. Enter Sir Robert Westford, and young Playnsey. Sir Rob. What murder? where's the Murderers? Y. Playn. Sir Robert draw, it is my friend that's wrong'd. Momf. Nay I beseech your worship hold your hands, Though I be old, I am sufficient To answer two far better men than these. Can. Sir Robert, as you are a Knight lay hold upon one, who was not content to rob us in the Kings high way, but would likewise have taken away our lives. Y. Playn. Upon my Soul you do the fellow wrong. Sir Rob. Nay, nay Son Playnsey, never take his part; How should the Beggar here of Bednall-Green Get so much wealth, as the world thinks he hath, And keep his minion at the Beggars house, But by such practices? yield up thy weapons, Or set upon him all, I'll answer it. Momf. Well, well, Sir Robert Westford, time has been The Blind-man and his Daughter did deserve More friendship at your hands: and Mr. Playnsey I could repeat, but let old matters rest. They beat Momf. Sir Rob. What do ye brave us? set upon the slave. Y. Playn. What is he gone? how did he scape our hands? Can. âI know not, I had a full blow at his left leg, I had thought I had cut it off. Enter Tom Stroud. Tom Stro. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, Canbee! Pray Heaven keep the old man from killing ere I come, and I care not. Can. What Tom Strowd? well met, where's the Wench? is she safe? Y. Stro. Safe! Dost thou make a question on't? I warrant she is safe enough for telling any more tales, I am no Bunglar about a VVench; but where's the Blind-beggar and his Brother? Can. The Beggar is a Devil, and his Brother his familiar; here's old Madge has bit off 100 and 50 Legs and Arms in her daies, and yet she could not so much as draw blood of him, hee's Musket-proof, or he had dyed for't else. Y. Playn. She is at Rederiff then, there I sent Strowd; VVe'll end this task, and then I'll visit her: But here's the Cottage, pull the Villain out, They knock. Hee's both a Fellon, and a Murderer. Enter Momford like a Beggar. Momf. VVhat means this out-rage at a Blind mans door? Are Englishmen become so inhumane That Beggars cannot scape their violence? Sir Rob. Leave this dissembling, and send forth thy Brother, For he hath rob'd these honest Gentlemen, VVe follow'd him, and saw him enter here, Therefore dispatch, and either send him out, Or else wee'll lock the Doors upon you both, And fire the rotten Cottage 'ore your ears. Momf. Indeed I must confess I have a Brother, An antient Serving-man, maym'd in the wars Under Lord Momfords colours. Y. Playn. For naming Momford run him through the heart. T. Stro. âTouch him he that dares; as God fa' me I'll be his Priest that toucheth but a hair of him? Can. Strowd, I hope you do but jest with us. T. Stro. Jest me no jests shall ne're be said, Tom Strowd of Harling stood by and saw a Blind-man murthered, therefore courage old Father, set thy back to mine, and cover thy head with thy Crutches; I'll take up my lodging on Gods dear ground, er'e thou shalt take any harm, for the pretty Mother thy Daughters sake. Enter old Playnsey, old Strowd, and Captain VVestford, Sill. Clark. Old Playn. How now? what quarrels have we here? Sir Robert Westford, it ill beseems a man of your estate To have a hand in such unlawfull riots; Are you there Son? have you so soon forgot The timeless death of your deceased wife, To follow such unseemly practises? Old. Stro. Ha, sest me so? dost take the blind mans part? Th'art a Strowd right, a Norfolk, Yeoman right, To take part with the weakest; Well done my Boy, I do forgive all matters that are past, For joy to see thy heart so well inclin'd. T. Stro. VVhy I thank you Father, and I forgive you too withall my heart. Sir Rob. Sir Walter Playnsey you are mis-inform'd, We come with no intent of injury, These Gentlemen were Strangers unto us, We found sore hurt and rob'd by a false Theef, And Brother to this Beggar, whom we saw Enter into his house. Old Playn. What say'st thou Father? Know'st thou of such a practise by thy Brother? Or to thy knowledge is he in the house? Momf. Sir Walter Playnsey, that I take's your name, So help me Heaven, as I am ignorant From any such lewd practise of my Brothers: But since your worships here, I'll call him forth In person, to make answer for himself, Desiring you to pardon me a while, For what with sorrow and with cares down prest, My sightless eyes had need to take their rest. Exit. Old Payn. Send us thy Brother and be thou discharg'd: But Mr. Strowd, what can you say to this? T. Stro. Faith Sir, 'tis a common saying in our Country, You shall know by the Market-folks how the Market goes; and none knows their Knavery better than I that was one of their company. Father do you see those two fellows there? Old Stro. I son, what of them? T. Stro. Why these were they that cosen'd me of my sattin sute, and with the false Repreeve that had like to a hang'd you, and rob'd Swash of the 100 l. too. Old Stro. What these Gentlemen? T. Stro. Gentlemen! as God mend me, a couple of as arrant Cony-catchers as e're pist. Old Stro. Is't possible Son? T. Stro. Push, you are a Fool Father, you know nothing, I have paid for my learning; and falling into their company in hope to get some satisfaction for all my losses; it was my chance to be by when Sir Robert Westford and Mr. Playnsey there gave them 30 l. to murder the Blind-beggar, his Brother, and his Daughter: but by my means the Beggar and his Daughter are alive, but what's become of his Brother I know not; this, as I am Tom Strowd of Harling, and a true-hearted Norfolk-man, I'll justifie against one, two, three, or the whole pack of em', when, where, or how they dare, for the very ears and guts of 'em all. Can. Strowd, y'are a Nit, a Slave, and a Pessant. T. Stro. How a Fessant?âI scorn to soyl my hands about thee: but and I had thee alone, with a tough Ashen Gibbet in my hand, and I did not dry bang ye all one after another, I'de eat no meat but Mustard; sen ye? Old Playn. Strowd have a care you speak nought but truth. Old Stro. And speak the truth Boy as thou art my Son. T. Stro. And I do not I'll give you leave to call me Cut, sen ye? Old Playn. Sir Robert Westford this concerns you near, And Son it touches your reputation too? Y. Playn. But it shall touch his life that Authors it; Strowd you are a villain, and for old grudge Enter Momford like a Serving-man. Betwixt your Father and Sir Robert Westford, Forg'd this surmise, as both these Gentlemen Are ready on their oaths to justifie. Can. No more, here comes the Slave that rob'd us. T. Stro. Rob'd ye! of what I trow? of your good conditions? Had. This is he that hack't my Thygh like a leg of Beef. T. Stro. Thou lyest like a Theef. Old Playn. Are you the Blind-mans Brother? Momf. Sir, I am. Old Playn. You are accus'd here of a Robbery, What can you answer in your own defence? Momf. Sir Walter Playnsey, and good Captain Westford, First as I look for comfort from above I never nurs'd a thought to that intent: Indeed these Gentlemen, Strangers to me, Did draw upon me, and as I suppose, By the provokement of Sir Robert Westford And Mr. Playnsey, sought to take my life. Old Playn. What reason should they have for that? Momf. Your worship shall perceive; Sir Robert Westford Wounded by Strowd, and desperate of life, Confest unto my Brother the Blind-man, That by the means of him and Mr. Playnsey They counterfeited these Letters that wrought Momford's banishment; Besides all this, My Sword shall justifie, that first by briber, And then by forcive means he would have forc'd My Neece unto his lust. All this is true, And this I'll justifie upon their bodies in the open lists. Y. Playn. Thou dar'st not for thy life? Momf. Playnsey I dare, And wo'd my Soveraign Liege give me but leave, This Sun should see thy Treasons punished. Sir Rob. Wert thou a Gentlemen as thou art a Slave, I'de make thee eat thy words or dig thy Grave. T. Stro. Eat a Pudding's end, the old man shall take no wrong Sir. Cap. West. Sir Robert Westford, your Gentility Shall not tread down the truth; long has my Soul Thirsted for this occasion: for when I saw You falsifie your faith, wedding your Daughter Unto Playnsey's Son, that was the Troth-plight Husband to Bess Momford, I thought as much as this poor man now speaks, And will in single combate prove as much; He of you both that thinks himself most touch'd, Take up my Gage. Y. Playn. Westford I'll answer thee. Can. And I'll maintain Sir Robert Westford's cause. Momf. Take up my Glove then. Sir Rob. Give me it, I'll maintain it my self. Had. This shall justifie that Strowd And that base Villain were agreed to murder us. T. Stro. I is the wind ei' that door, I'll take up thy Glove: but âand I bang not thy Coxcomb, hang me la. Old Playn. I hope this challeng'd combate will decide the truth. Cap. West. Which Heaven assisting, and the King well pleas'd, Shall be perform'd this present afternoon; I'll to the King, and never raise my Knee from the cold earth, Till I obtain, by privilege of flight A black revenge for worthy Momford's fall. Ex. Cap. West. Y. Playn. And thither Westford will I follow thee, Or born upon the wings of my just cause, Arive before thee. Exit Y. Playn. Sir Rob. Each man take his way. St. George and Conquest guide our swords this day. [Exeunt, manent Old Stro. Courage my Boy, if thou prevail in fight, [the Strowds. I'll swear Lord Momford hath not had his right. T. Stro. Courage sa' ye? as God mend me, I respect them no more than I do a flap with a Fox tayl, and I do not beat 'em as ye sho'd cuyle a side of dry'd Stock-fish, I'll be bound to go to Rome with a Morter a my head. Old Stro. Why well said my Son, let's away. T. Stro. But heark ye Father; you know I am to go amongst the Court-nowles, you must needs let me have good store of mony with me, let not the name of STROWDS be disgrac'd, I pray Father. Old Stro. Tush Boy, fear not, I'll carry 500 l. with me, and that shall fly ere thou want. T. Stro. âAnd I'll bring some of my own too, or it shall go hard. Exeunt. Musick. Cornets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Sound Trumpets. Enter King Harry the 6th. Gloster, Cardinal, Lady Ellanor, and Lords attending. King. Vncle of Gloster, and Lord Cardinal, Since all our Court has put on smooth-fac'd mirth, Only to grace your Honor'd Mariage, Embrace each other in the arms of Love, And as you joyn your hands, so let your hearts Knit your affections in a friendly league. Glost. Gloster speaks first, yet speaks he not in fear, As begging Bewford's friendship, but in love Both to his King, and to fair Englands good; Yet ere I set my hand to this new League, Bewford, if any undisgested wrong Lyes in thy swelling bosome, freely speak't, And Gloster will as freely answer it: But if thy Conscience be as clear from soyl Of hatefull treachery, as Glosters is, Give me thy hand, and with thy hand thy heart, Which Gloster will as charily regard, As the best blood that's chamber'd in his breast. Card. On that Condition Bewford gives his hand, And from his heart wipes off all forepass'd wrongs. King. Witness this League Lords, and now Ant Ellanor Heaven give you joy, both of our Uncles love, And of this new born peace. Now Uncle Gloster I desire to know The cause of Momford's treason, and his fall, Which he hath lately undergone in France? Glost. His fall my Liege was great, but his offence Little or none; for by Velleires his means, Who as a Prisoner now attends your Grace, I have found out since Momford's banishment, That all his accusations were false. King. Yet Guynes in which Lord Momford had a charge, Was yeelded up by Treason. Glost. True my Liege, I have known Momford in my Brothers days, Put in great trust; yet never heard That he was found disloyal in his charge. King. And Uncle Gloster, we have always had His honor'd age in reverent esteem. We hear he had a Daughter, where lives she? Glost. Thrust out of all by one old Westford's means. King. Methinks 'tis hard the Child should not enjoy The riches that the painfull Father left. Good Uncle Gloster let it be your care, To see old Momferd's Daughter have her right. Enter old Pl. But what grave man is that? Glost. Sir Walter Playnsey, The bosom friend unto exiled Momford. King. Sir Walter Playnsey, by our Uncles leave I pray stand up, methinks those reverent hairs Deserve a softer pillar than the ground; I pray stand up, and boldly speak your mind. Old Playn. My Soveraign Liege, your Subject comes in love To let you know, that divers Gentlemen, On what presumption they themselves best know, Have underta'en to prove in open field, That the Lord Momford who late fell in France, Was treacherously accus'd. Glost. Why? 'twas your Son That first produc'd his accusation. Old Playn. Your Grace will give me leave to clear my self, For I was neither privy to that fact, Nor speak in his excuse; he is my Son, But if in malice he hath wrong'd Lord Momford, Let him have Justice, and the Law take place. King. Are they resolv'd to try it out in fight? Old Playn. They are my Liege, and only wait your pleasure. King. Even what our Uncle Gloster will set down. We do assent to. Glost. Herald fetch them in, See them at all points arm'd. Enter with Drum Sir Robert West. young Playn. Canbee and Hadland. At the other Door old Momf. Cap. West. Tom Srrowd, and old Strowd, and Bess. Glost. Who is the Plaintiff? Momf. I my gracious Lord. Glost. Reach him the Book, and thereon take thine Oath, That thou art neither drawn by bribes nor hate To undertake this Combat.â'Tis enough. Speak truth, and nought but truth, so help thee Heaven. Momf. Pleaseth your Grace, this in a word is all, Sir Robert Westford and Mr. Playnsey there confest To a Blind-man, in hearing of that Maid, That Playnsey and himself did counterfeit The Letters that wrought Momfords banishment. Glost. Give him the Book, now answer on thine oath In thy defence. Sir Rob. Then first my Liege 'tis false, Next hee's a Felon, and by force of arms Offer'd to rob these honest Gentlemen In the high way. T. Stro. âThen I can hold my tongue no longer, it's an arrant lye my Lord, that's the plain English on't: for I was by when Sir Robert Westford and Mr. Playnsey gave them 30 l. to murder the Blind-beggar, his Brother, and his Daughter, and if I had not been, they had been all kill'd too, so had they. King. Fellows what do you say to this? Can. My Liege I cannot talk, grant me the Combate, and my Sword shall prove I am a Souldier, and my tongue nere knew the art of scolding. Glost. Give him his will, alarum to the fight. King. Stay, for me thinks there is some difference, Both in their years, and their conditions, And for we highly prize our Subject lives, Good Uncle Gloster let them choose their weapons, It may be a means to save their lives. Glost. And hearten others in pursute of knowledge. Herauld bring forth all sorts of weapons, 'Tis the King's pleasure that every man Make choice of those weapons he hath practis'd most. Sir Robert chuse your weapon first. Sir Rob. Thanks to my Liege: the common fight of these same serving men is sword and dagger, therefore I'll chuse the sword and target they are unskilfull in; I take the sword and target for my defence. Momf. And my Liege, because Sir Rob. Westford shall not think I'll take any advantage, I'll answer him at his own weapons. King. 'Tis well; on to the next. Y. Playn. Come Captain Westford, you have been in Spain, And well are practis'd in the desperate fight of single Rapier? Cap. West. Playnsey I am pleas'd. King. So are not we, the single Rapier is too desperate, And therefore choose some other weapon, Or we will have no Combat fought this day. Y. Playn. Backsword then and't please your Grace. King. So, we are pleas'd. Can. Sirrah Jack, methinks Sword and Bucklet's a safe fight. Had. I'll choose no other, and I had a thousand lives. Tom. Stro. I do, take your bars of Iron, and your Barn-doors, and I do not bang 'em together like a couple of Cur-dogs, I'll nere be seen again. King. Sirrah thou fellow. T. Stro. Anon. King. What weapons wilt thou use? T. Stro. Weapon me no weapons, I can play at wasters as well as another man; but all's one for that, give me but an ashen Gibbet in my hand, and I do not dry-bang them both, I'll be bound to eat hay with a horse, so will I. King. An ashen-gibbet? what dost thou mean by that? T. Stro. What do I mean by it quoth ye?âI think you be sib to one of the London-Cockneys, that ask't, whether Hay-cocks were better meat broyl'd or rosted, an ashen Plant, a good Cudgell, what sho'd I ca it? King. If there be such a weapon in the Court, let one go fetch it him. T. Stro. Nay I'll make a page of my own age, and fet it my self. Swash bring out my blest Beggar there. Enter Swash with an ashen-Gibbet: Swash. Yes Sir, here's your blest Beggar Master. T. Stro. Look ye Sirs, this is en it, and I do not cudgell 'em both with it, I'll give you leave to stick me up at the Court-gate for a Pissing-post, so will I. King. But two to one is oddes, rather fight single. T. Stro. No, they know me well enough, I have cudgelled them both afore now. King. Well, if thou dare oppose them both, have thy desire. King. Alarum to the flight. Alarum. They fight, and Momford's side wins. King. Fellow, dost hear? T. Stro. Anon? King. What should I call thy Country, and thy name? T. Stro. Sen ye? Glost. The King wo'd know thy Country, and thy name? T. Stro. My name? I am not asham'd of my name, I am one Tom Strowd of Harling, I'll play a gole at Camp-ball, or wrassel a fall a the hip, or the hin turn with ere a Courtnoll of ye all, for 20 quarters of Malt, and match me height for height. King. A lusty fellow trustâ We have too few such Subjects in our Land; where's the Blind-beggar and his brother? T. Stro. Where the Blind-beggar is I know not, but here's the pretty Mother his Daughter; and thou beest a kind spring all speak a good word for me to my father that I may have her, and as God mend me and ere thou com'st into Norfolk I'll give thee as good a Dish of Dumplings as e're thou layd'st thy lips too, so will I, sen ye? Old Stro. How? mary with a Beggar? mix the blood of Strowds with a tatter? either cast her off, or I will cast off thee. T. Stro. Now we shall have a coyl with ye; and ye were not my father I'd knock your pate, so wo'd I. Old Stro. How's that? do and thou dare. Momf. Strowd, though she be Daughter to a poor Bind-man that long hath liv'd on good mens charity, do not disdain her. Be her birth as it may, the portion I'll give with her, deserves as good a Husband as your Son. T. Stro. Bate me an ace of that gd. Bolton, yet I would I had her as naked as my nayl. Old Stro. As good a portion as my Son? proud Beggar, 'Tis not your Clapdish and your patch'd Gown can do't. Momf. However poor, good Sir digrace me not. Old Stro. 'Tis my disgrace to be out-worded by a Beggar? But and thou be'st such a well-monied man As thou dost brag, dar'st drop old Angels with me? And he that out-drops other, take up all? Momf. That were ambition in a beggar Sir. Cap. West. 'Twere credit for thee, and thou couldst out-drop him. Momf. So please my Liege to give me leave, I'll venture That small Estate I have. King. We are content, 'Mongst cares 'tis fit to mix some meriment. Momf. Come hither Daughter; are you ready Master? T. Stro. âTo him Father, never lose a hog for a halfp'worth of tar; come old fellow bring thy white Bears to the stake, and thy yellow gingle boys to the Bull-ring;âFather wherefore do you hang an arse so? they are all our own and there were a comb seek full on 'em Momf. I thus begin. Old Stro. And thus I answer thee. Momf. Thus I reply. Old Stro. And thus do I joyn issue. T. Stro. I had rather joyn issue with the Mother a great deal, had I. Old Stro. Some more mony Swash. Swash. Here Master, we'll outdrop the Beggar, we'll make Gill sweat else. Old Stro. Hast thou any mony about thee Tom? T. Stro. An hundred angels, and a better peny, Pigs of your own Sow Father. Momf. There's 20 more. Old Stro. More yet? the Rascal will disgrace me; more yet? T. Stro. And yet too,âyou think beggars ha' no lice father. Glost. Why how now Strowd, begins it to be low water with ye? Old Stro. I am e'en run a ground, have drop'd till I can drop no more. T. Stro. You must e'en burn of the spit, for I have no more oyl of Angels to bast you father. Old Stro. Nor thou Swash? Swash. Only a broken three farthings that I kept in a corner to buy my wench pins with. Momf. All this is mine then. Old Stro. I not deny't, 'tis true That was our match, and so good Gold adue. T. Stro. âI have brought my hogs to a fair Market, must I lose the Mother and all my Gold too? Old Stro. Yes faith, all's gone Tom. T. Stro. This is your foolery Father, and I had don't, we sho'd have had such a scolding with you. Momf. Then Strowd where thou before didst scorn my Daughter, Now I do scorn thy Son; not mov'd through hate, For Strowd I hold thee a most honest man, For right thou didst unto Lord Momford's Daughter, And since thy Son did save my poor Girls life, And rescued mine with hazard of his own, This Gold which by our bargain is all mine I freely give him towards his mariage. King. Trust me a gallant Beggar. T. Stro. Beggar?âHe might be a King for his bounty, for he gives away all. Swash. I know the reason of that, he can beg more, and Begging be so good an occupation wo'd I had been bound Apprentice to't seven years ago, there was somewhat to be got by it then, 'tis out of request now. T. Stro. This is old excellent, here carry't to my Chamber Swash, and lock the door fast I charge thee. Swash. And I meet no false Knaves by the way; Canbee and Hadland here had been a simple boon for you now. Exit. Momf. And now my Lord, since Momford is prov'd clear, And his Accusers have confest their guilt, I freely give my Daughter to the man, Who for the love of Momford (lov'd of all) Will take her to his wife. Cap. West. For Momford's sake, whose honor'd deeds Are writ up with the blood of the proud French, Were she the meanest and deformed'st Creature That treads upon the bosome of the earth, Westford wo'd take, love, live and marry her. Momf. Nay then I see that virtue shall find friends; Take her good Captain, and for Momford's sake Use the Maid kindly. T. Stro. Why farewell 40 pence, I ha fisht fair and caught a frog; well Mother, though I am no Gentleman, I co'd ha brought you to more Land than a score on 'em, thou should'st have had 40 as fair milch kine to your payl, as a man sho'd need to see in a Summers day, 4 yoak of Oxen, and three team of Cart-horses; besides thou should'st have had thine ambling nag, and thy side-saddle to ha rid on, a little easier than to be jaunted up and down London Streets in a lethern wheel-barrow; and then of the other side there's the old woman my Mother, she would have made thee a vild-good Huswife could have taught thee how to a made butter, and flap-jacks, fritters, pancakes, I and the rarest fools, all the Ladies in the Land know not how to turn their hands to 'em: But I'll take my leave on thee with an oh good night Land-lady the Moon is up. Momford discovers himself. Cap. W., Gl., Card. Momford! King. Bold Momford living, and proved Loyal, Thy Love like a rich Jewel we will wear Next to our hear; upon those Gentlemen That have maintain'd and proved faithfull, We do confer a 100 Crowns a piece. Momf. Your Grace in this does Momford double right; And noble Country-men while we do live, Your Love and Valour must not be forgotten. Old Playn. How is't you will we deal with your Accusers? King. That we refer unto our Uncle Gloster, Who better knows those passages than we. Glost. Since 'tis your will my Liege, then thus't must be, For you Y. Playnsey and Sir Robert Westford Receive a legal Tryal; Canbee and Hadland, We for a President will have you sent Out of the Land to dateless banishment. Can. Thanks your good Honor, and we'll do you more good by cheating your enemies abroad, than ever we did hurt by cosening honest subjects at home. King. Good Uncle Gloster, we commend your care For throwing out such rank weeds forth our Land, Whose weaken'd body hath been sick too long, Wanting those helps that should have made it strong. 'Mongst whom Lord Momford you are not the least, (Pray Heaven you be the last) whom this wilde beast, Ambitious treason sought to ruinate: But in requital of your more than wrong We make you here our Lord High-Treasurer; And Captain Westford, make you General Of all our forces muster'd up 'gainst France. Thus our disjointed Kingdom being made strong, Each Member seated in his proper seat Let's in to praise his name, whose powerfull hand Protects the safety of our peacefull Land. JOHN DAY.
