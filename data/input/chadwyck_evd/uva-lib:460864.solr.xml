      <field name="fulltext">THE BIRDS OF ARISTOPHANES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The following two paragraphs have been extracted from the Preface I am not aware that any attempt has been before made at a metrical version of the Birds of Aristophanes in English. Mr. Mitchell, who has lately favoured us with an entire translation of the Wasps, and of several scenes from the Acharnians and Knights, leaves it uncertain, in the preface to his last volume, whether he will proceed with the remainder of the plays. It is trusted that the present version will be found, in the dialogue part, tolerably close to the original, except where one of the following cases seemed to warrant a departure from it; first, when the grossness of the poet is such as our manners would not admit of, which happens in two or three instances; next, when there is some play on words, which it would be impossible to preserve exactly in another language; and lastly, when the names of birds are introduced, in which latter case it is sometimes not known what birds are meant, and sometimes the English names, when known, are such as would not conveniently come into the verse. Throughout the lyrical parts in general more liberty has been taken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT. Euelpides and PisthetÃ¦rus, two ancient Athenians, thoroughly weary of the folly, injustice, and litigious temper of their countrymen, determine to leave Attica for good and all; and having heard much of the fame of Epops, king of the birds, who was once a man under the name of Tereus, and had married an Athenian lady, they pack up a few necessary utensils, and set out for the court of that prince, under the conduct of a jay and a raven, birds of great distinction in augury, without whose direction the Greeks never undertook any thing of consequence. Their errand is to inquire of the birds, who are the greatest travellers of any nation, where they may meet with a quiet, easy settlement, far from all prosecutions, law-suits, and sycophant informers, to pass the remainder of their lives in peace and liberty. ACT I.âSCENE I. The scene is a wild, unfrequented country, which terminates in mountains; there the old men are seen, (accompanied by two slaves, who carry their little baggage), fatigued and fretting at the carelessness of their guides, who, though they cost them a matter of a groat in the market, are good for nothing but to bite them by the fingers, and lead them out of the way. They travel on however, till they come to the foot of the rocks, which stop up their passage, and put them to their wits' end. Here the raven croaks, and the jay chatters and looks up into the air, as much as to say that this is the place: upon which they knock with a stone and with their heels (as though it were against a door) against the side of the mountain. SCENE II. Trochilus, a bird that waits upon Epops, appears above; he is frightened at the sight of two men, and they are much more so at the length of his beak and the fierceness of his aspect. He takes them for fowlers; and they insist upon it, that they are not men but birds. In their confusion, their guides, whom they held in a string, escape and fly away. Epops, during this, is asleep within, after having dined upon a dish of beetles and berries: their noise wakens him, and he comes out of the grove. SCENE III. At the strangeness of his figure they are divided between fear and laughing. They tell him their errand, and he gives them the choice of several cities fit for their purpose, one particularly on the coast of the Red Sea, all which they refuse, for many comical reasons. He tells them the happiness of living among the birds; they are much pleased with the liberty and simplicity of it; and PisthetÃ¦rus, a shrewd old fellow, proposes a scheme to improve it, and make them a far more powerful and considerable nation. Epops is struck with the project, and calls up his consort, the nightingale, to summon all his people together with her voice. They sing a fine ode. SCENE IV. The birds come flying down, at first one by one, and perch here and there about the scene; and at last the Chorus, in a whole body, come hopping, and fluttering, and twittering in. At the sight of the two men they are in great tumult, and think that their king has betrayed them to the enemy. They determine to tear the two old men to pieces, draw themselves up in battle array, and are giving the word to fall on. Euelpides and PisthetÃ¦rus, in all the terrors of death, after upbraiding each the other for bringing him into such distress, and trying in vain to escape, assume courage from mere despair, seize upon the kitchen-furniture which they had brought with them, and armed with pipkins for helmets, and with spits for lances, they present a resolute front to the enemy's phalanx. On the point of battle Epops interposes, pleads hard for his two guests, who are, he says, his wife's relations, and people of wonderful abilities, and well-affected to their commonwealth. His eloquence has its effect: the birds grow less violent, they enter into a truce with the old men, and both sides lay down their arms. PisthetÃ¦rus, upon the authority of Ãsop's fables, proves to them the great antiquity of their nation; that they were born before the creation of the earth, and before the gods, and once reigned over all countries, as he shows from several testimonies and monuments of different nations; that the cock wears his tiara erect, like the Persian king, and that all mankind start out of their beds at his command; that when the kite makes his first appearance in the spring, every one prostrates himself on the ground before it; that the Egyptians and PhÅnicians set about their harvest as soon as the cuckoo is heard; that all kings bear an eagle on their sceptre, and many of the gods carry a bird on their head; that many great men swear by the goose, &amp;c. &amp;c. When he has revived in them the memory of their ancient empire, he laments their present despicable condition, and the affronts put upon them by mankind. They are convinced of what he says, applaud his oration, and desire his advice. He proposes that they shall unite, and build a city in the mid-air, whereby all commerce will effectually be stopped between heaven and earth: the gods will no longer be able to visit at ease their Semeles and Alcmenas below, nor feast on the fume of sacrifices daily sent up to them, nor men enjoy the benefit of the seasons, nor the fruits of the earth, without permission from those winged deities of the middle region. He shows how mankind will lose nothing by this change of government; that the birds may be worshipped at a far less expense, nothing more than a few berries or a handful of corn; that they will need no sumptuous temples; that by their great knowledge of futurity they will direct their good votaries in all their expeditions, so as they can never fail of success; that the ravens, famed for the length of their lives, may make a present of a century or two to their worshippers; and, besides, the birds will ever be within call, when invoked, and not sit pouting in the clouds, and keeping their state so many miles off. The scheme is highly admired, and the two old men are to be made free of the city, and each of them is to be adorned with a pair of wings at the public charge. Epops invites them to his nest-royal, and entertains them nobly. The nightingale in the meantime joins the Chorus without, and the parabasis begins. SCENE V. They sing their own nobility and ancient grandeur, their prophetic skill, the benefits they do mankind already, and all the good which they design them; they descant upon the power of music, in which they are such great masters, and intermix many strokes of satire; they show the advantages of flying, and apply it to several whimsical cases; and they invite all such as would be free from the heavy tyranny of human laws, to live among them, where it is no sin to beat one's father, &amp;c. &amp;c. ACT II.âSCENE I. The old men, now become birds, and magnificently fledged, after laughing awhile at the new and awkward figure they make, consult about the name which they shall give to their rising city, and fix upon that of Nephelococcygia, or Cuckoocloudland; and while one goes to superintend the workmen, the other prepares to sacrifice for the prosperity of the city, which is growing apace. SCENE II. They begin a solemn prayer to all the birds of Olympus, putting the swan in the place of Apollo, the cock in that of Mars, and the ostrich in that of the great mother Cybele, &amp;c. SCENE III. A miserable poet having already heard of the new settlement, comes with some lyric poetry, which he has composed on this great occasion. PisthetÃ¦rus knows his errand from his looks, and makes them give him an old coat; but not contented with that, he begs to have the waistcoat to it, in the elevated style of Pindar: they comply, and get rid of him. SCENE IV. The sacrifice is again interrupted by a begging prophet, who brings a cargo of oracles, partly relating to the prosperity of the city of Nephelococcygia, and partly to a new pair of shoes, of which he is in extreme want. PisthetÃ¦rus loses patience, and cuffs him and his religious trumpery off the stage. SCENE V. Meto, the famous geometrician, comes next, and offers a plan which he has drawn for the new buildings, with much importance and impertinence: he meets with as bad a reception as the prophet. SCENES VI. AND VII. An ambassador, or licensed spy, from Athens, arrives, and a legislator with a body of new laws. They are used with abundance of indignity, and go off, threatening every body with a prosecution. The sacred rites being so often interrupted, they are forced to remove their altar, and finish them behind the scenes. SCENE VIII. The Chorus rejoice in their own increasing power; and (as about the time of the Dionysia it was usual to make proclamation against the enemies of the republic) they set a price upon the head of a famous poulterer, who has exercised infinite cruelties upon their friends and brethren; then they turn themselves to the judges and spectators, and promise, if this drama obtain the victory, how propitious they will be to them. ACT III.âSCENE I. PisthetÃ¦rus returns, and reports, that the sacrifice appears auspicious to their undertaking: a messenger then enters, with an account how quick the works advance, and whimsically describes the employments allotted to the several birds, in different parts of the building. SCENE II. Another messenger arrives in a violent hurry, to tell how somebody from heaven has deceived the vigilance of the jackdaws, who were upon guard, and passed through the gates down into the lower air; but that a whole squadron of light-winged forces were in pursuit of this insolent person, and hoped to fetch him back again. The birds are in great perturbation, and all in a flutter about it. SCENE III. This proves to be Iris, who in her return is stopped short, and seized by order of PisthetÃ¦rus. He examines her, where is her passport? Whether she had leave from the watch? What is her business? Who she is? in short, he treats her with great authority. She tells her name, and that she was sent by Jove with orders to mankind, that they should keep holiday, and perform a grand sacrifice; she wonders at their sauciness and madness, and threatens them with all her father's thunder. The governor of Nephelococcygia returns it with higher menaces, and with language very indecent indeed for a goddess and a maid to hear: however, with much-ado, she carries off her virginity safe, but in a terrible passion. SCENE IV. The herald, who had been despatched to the lower world, returns with an account that all Athens was gone bird-mad; that it was grown a fashion to imitate them in their names and manners; and that shortly they might expect to see a whole convoy arrive, in order to settle among them. The Chorus run to fetch a vast cargo of feathers and wings to equip their new citizens, when they come. SCENE V. The first who appears is a profligate young fellow, who hopes to enjoy a liberty, which he could not enjoy so well at home, the liberty of beating his father. PisthetÃ¦rus allows it indeed to be the custom of his people; but at the same time informs him of an ancient law preserved among the storks, that they shall maintain their parents in their old age. This is not at all agreeable to the youth: however, in consideration of his affection for the Nephelococcygians, PisthetÃ¦rus furnishes him with a feather for his helmet, and a cock's spur for a weapon, and advises him, as he seems to be of a military turn, to go into the army in Thrace. SCENE VI. The next is Cinesias, the dithyrambic writer, who is delighted with the thought of living among the clouds, amidst those airy regions, whence all his poetical flights are derived; but PisthetÃ¦rus will have no such animal among his birds: he drives him back to Athens with great contempt. SCENE VII. He then drives away also (but not without a severe whipping) an informer, who for the better despatch of business comes to beg a pair of wings to carry him round the islands and cities subject to Athens, whose inhabitants he is used to swear against for an honest livelihood, as did, he says, his fathers before him. The birds, in the ensuing chorus, relate their travels, and describe the strange things and strange men they have seen in them. ACT IV.âSCENE I. A person in disguise, with all the appearance of caution and fear, comes to inquire for PisthetÃ¦rus, to whom he discovers himself to be Prometheus, and tells him (but first he makes them hold a large umbrella over his head for fear Jupiter should spy him) that the Gods are all in a starving, miserable condition; and, what is worse, that barbarian gods (who live no one knows where, in a part of heaven far beyond the gods of Greece) threaten to make war upon them, unless they will open the ports, and renew the intercourse between mankind and them, as of old. He advises PisthetÃ¦rus to make the most of this intelligence, and to reject all offers boldly, which Jupiter may make him, unless he will consent to restore to the birds their ancient power, and give him in marriage his favourite attendant, Basilea. This said, he slips back again to heaven, as he came. The chorus continue an account of their travels. SCENE II. An embassy arrives from heaven, consisting of Hercules, Neptune, and a certain Triballian god. As they approach the city walls, Neptune is dressing and scolding at the outlandish divinity, and teaching him how to carry himself a little decently. They find PisthetÃ¦rus busy in giving orders about a dish of wild fowl (i.e. of birds which had been guilty of high misdemeanours, and condemned to die by the public) which are dressing for his dinner. Hercules, who before was for bringing off the head of this audacious mortal without further conference, finds himself insensibly relent, as he snuffs the savoury steam. He salutes PisthetÃ¦rus, who receives them very coldly, and is more attentive to his kitchen than to their compliment. Neptune opens his commission; owns that his nation (the gods) are not the better for this war, and on reasonable terms would be glad of a peace. PisthetÃ¦rus, according to the advice of Prometheus, proposes (as if to try them) the first condition, namely, that of Jupiter's restoring to the birds their ancient power; and, if this should be agreed to, he says, that he hopes to entertain my lords the ambassadors at dinner. Hercules, pleased with this last compliment, so agreeable to his appetite, comes readily into all he asks; but is severely reproved by Neptune for his gluttony. PisthetÃ¦rus argues the point, and shows how much it would be for the mutual interest of both nations; and Neptune is hungry enough to be glad of some reasonable pretence to give the thing up. The Triballian god is asked his opinion for form: he mutters somewhat, which nobody understands, and so it passes for his consent. Here they are going in to dinner, and all is well; when PisthetÃ¦rus bethinks himself of the match with Basilea. This makes Neptune fly out again: he will not hear of it; he will return home instantly; but Hercules cannot think of leaving a good meal so; he is ready to acquiesce in any conditions. His colleague attempts to show him that he is giving up his patrimony for a dinner; and what will become of him after Jupiter's death, if the birds are to have every thing during his life-time. PisthetÃ¦rus clearly proves to Hercules that this is a mere imposition; that by the laws of Solon a bastard has no inheritance; that if Jove died without legitimate issue, his brothers would succeed to his estate, and that he speaks only out of interest. Now the Triballian god is again to determine the matter; they interpret his jargon as favourable to them; so Neptune is forced to give up the point, and PisthetÃ¦rus goes with him and the barbarian to heaven to fetch his bride, while Hercules stays behind to take care that the roast meat is not spoiled. ACT V.âSCENE THE FIRST AND LAST. A messenger returns with the news of the approach of PisthetÃ¦rus and his bride; and accordingly they appear in the air in a splendid machine, he with Jove's thunderbolt in his hand, and by his side Basilea, magnificently adorned: the birds break out into loud songs of exultation, and conclude the drama with their hymeneal. âGray's Works, V. ii. p. 160. 4to. 1814.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Euelpides, PisthetÃ¦rus. Euelpides (speaking to his jackdaw). Bidst thou me go straight onward where the tree is? PisthetÃ¦rus. Plague on thee; but this bird of mine croaks âBack again.â Euelpides. Thou miserable fellow, canst resolve me Wherefore we thus do wander up and down, Periling ourselves in this wild random search? PisthetÃ¦rus. Wretch that I am, to have been danced about More than a hundred stadia in obsequiousness To a raven's marshaling! Euelpides. My fate's no better, That have been tearing off my nails to scramble After this jackdaw! PisthetÃ¦rus. Where i'th'world we are I have no guess! Euelpides. And couldst thou find out hence Where one's own country lies? PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jupiter, that Might puzzle Execestides himself. Euelpides. Out on it! PisthetÃ¦rus. Friend, do you go, try that way. Euelpides. He has play'd us a pretty trick, no doubt on't, That fellow with his tray there, mad Philocrates, Who told us that these two would show us where We might find Tereus out, the Epops, him Who was made birdâout of a bird. He sold Him Tharrelides' jackdaw for an obol, And me this fowl for three; but devil a thing They know but how to bite one. And you, sirrah, (to the jackdaw) You with your mouth agape, what wot you of? Where wilt thou take us next? into the rock? For here I see no way. PisthetÃ¦rus. Nor here, by Jove; Not a footstep. Euelpides. Nor doth not the raven tell thee Aught of the way? PisthetÃ¦rus. Nought; but is croaking still Just as he was erewhile. Euelpides. But of the way What saith he now? PisthetÃ¦rus. What but that he will gnaw My fingers till he has eat them off? Euelpides. Is't not A burning shame now, when we have made our minds up To go to the crows, and are prepar'd for't, then Not to be able to find out the way? For we (I'd have you note us, all that hear) [To the spectators. Are in a sore disaster, the opposite To that of Sacas. He, being no citizen, Forces himself in; we, by birth and tribe Distinguish'd, citizens 'mongst citizens, When not a soul cries âwhewâ to start us up, Fly from our country fast as legs can carry us: Not that we hate the city in herself For not being naturally great and blessed And common to allâwho'd spend their coin in lawsuits: The grasshoppers, they, but a month or two Chirp on the branches, but the Athenians still On the law-benches sit and chirp their lives out: And this it is hath made us to set out This uncouth journey with our little furniture, A pot, a basket, and these myrtle stakes, Wandering in quest of some place free from trouble, Where we may settle us down and dwell in peace. So are we bound to Tereus, we, the Epops, To ask of him if ever in his flights He hath visited such a city. PisthetÃ¦rus. Ho! Euelpides. What now? PisthetÃ¦rus. The raven gives me notice this some time Of something up aloft. Euelpides. Ay, and this daw too Is gaping upward, as 'twould show me somewhat. It cannot be but that the birds are here. We shall know that anon, an we make noise enough. Dost know what's best to do? Strike with thy foot Against the rock. PisthetÃ¦rus. And with thy head strike thou; So shall the noise be double. Euelpides. Take a stone then, And knock. PisthetÃ¦rus. That's something like. Here goes. Euelpides. Boy! boy! PisthetÃ¦rus. Hilloah! what sayst thou? call'st the Epops boy? Thou shouldst have shouted Epops, and not boy. Euelpides. Ho! Epops! Must I knock again? Ho! Epops! SCENE II. Trochilus, Euelpides, PisthetÃ¦rus. Trochilus. Who's there? Who's he, that bawls out on my master? Euelpides. PhÅbus Averter! what a yawn was there! Trochilus had his beak opened, as if he intended to swallow them. Trochilus. Wretch that I am! two bird-catchers are these. Euelpides. Oh horrible! mention not such a thing. Trochilus. Curse on ye! Euelpides. Yet we are not men. Trochilus. What then? Euelpides. I am a bird from Libya, call'd the Fearling. Trochilus. Nay, nay, thou triflest. Euelpides. Ask then what's before thee. Trochilus. And he, what bird is he? Wilt thou not tell? PisthetÃ¦rus. I am the Dropling, a Phasianic fowl. Euelpides. But thou, what beast art thou, by all the Gods? Trochilus. I am a slave-bird. Euelpides. What! hast thou been worsted By some game-cock in battle? Trochilus. No: but when My master was made Epops, he did wish Me too to be transfigur'd to a bird, That he might have me for his pursuivant, and still To serve him. Euelpides. Wants a bird then one to serve him? Trochilus. He, having been formerly a man, will sometimes Long for a meal of Phaleric anchovies: Then straight a dish take I, and run to fetch them. Does he lack porridge? He must have his pot And ladle; so I run to fetch his ladle. Euelpides. This is the Trochilus bird, I see. Dost know then, Good Trochilus, what to do for us? Call out Thy master, that we may speak with him forthwith. Trochilus. By Jove, he is this instant fall'n asleep, After his dinner of gnats and myrtle berries. Euelpides. No matter: wake him. Trochilus. He'll be finely fretted, I am sure of that: but to please you I'll wake him. [Exit Trochilus. Euelpides. Alas! Alas! the jackdaw in my terror Has given me the slip. PisthetÃ¦rus. Thou cowardly beast, Hast thou let go the jackdaw in thy fright? Euelpides. And tell me did not you let loose the raven When you slipp'd down but now? PisthetÃ¦rus. Not I, by Jove. Euelpides. Where is he then? PisthetÃ¦rus. O he has flown away. Euelpides. What? so you did not loose him? You're a brave one. SCENE III. Epops, Euelpides, PisthetÃ¦rus. Epops. Unbar the forest, that I may come forth. Euelpides. Great Hercules! Why what a monster's here! What plumage! what a triple tire of cresting! Epops. Who are they, seek me? Euelpides. The twelve Gods, I think, Are banded for our ruin. Epops. Mock ye at me, Seeing my plumage? Strangers, I was once A man. Euelpides. At thee we laugh not. Epops. At whom then? Euelpides. The beak thou hast in truth is somewhat laughable. Epops. This is a mischief Sophocles hath done In his rare tragedies to meâto Tereus. Euelpides. Tereus art thou? say, whether bird or peacock? Epops. A birdâI am a bird. Euelpides. But where thy pennons? Epops. They're moulted. Euelpides. What? through some disorder haply? Epops. No: but in winter time all birds do use To shed their feathers; and then we put forth new. But, tell me, who are ye? Euelpides. We? Mortals. Epops. Whence? Euelpides. Whence the fine gallies come from, thence are we. Epops. Ay? What, law-chicaners? Euelpides. Nay, clean contrary; Anti-chicaners. Epops. Sow they in that country Such seed then? Euelpides. In small quantities, forsooth, I'th'fields ye might perchance pick up a little. Epops. What errand brought ye hither? Euelpides. To confer With thee, our wish was. Epops. On what matter, pray? Euelpides. Since thou wert first a man, e'en as we, once, And wert in debt moreover, as we, once, And wouldst fain shirk thy creditors, as we, once; But after for a bird's thy nature changedst, And flewst o'er lands and seas the circle round, And so kennst all things that or man or bird may; Therefore as suppliants are we hither come to thee, If thou wouldst show us some warm, well-fleeced city, To creep into like a blanket and lie snug. Epops. Seekst thou a greater city than the Craggy? Euelpides. A greater? no; but one more suited to us. Epops. You're looking for an aristocracy, I trow. Euelpides. I? Hang me then. I hate his very name, That whoreson cub of Scellius. Epops. My sweet fellow, Tell me what sort of city 'tis you'd like. Euelpides. I'll tell you; where one's greatest trouble should be Something of this kind. By good times i'th'morning I should look out and see standing at my door Some friend. âI'm come,â says he, âto say that you And your family must dine with me to-day. Be early. No excuses, by the Olympian. We have a wedding toward. If ye fail me, Take heed I never see you when I'm poor.â Epops. By Jupiter, you're mighty fond of trouble. And you, what would you have? PisthetÃ¦rus. I'll tell you. Epops. Well. PisthetÃ¦rus. Something of this kind. I should like a place Where, if one met a neighbour, he should chide one After this fashion, âSir, you wish to affront me. I have a daughter, a good comely girl, You met her t'other day as she came home From her devotions in her best attire, Yet you ne'er stay'd to kiss or toy with her, Nor took no liberty with her no more Than she were a trull. It is not handsome of you, Considering on what terms we have always been.â This is one of the few passages in the present play where the impurity of the original made it necessary to substitute something that should be less offensive to the modern reader. Epops. You sorry rascal! what sad doings you'd have! However there is some such blessed city. As you are talking ofâby the Red Sea. Euelpides. Alas! Alas! let it not be by the sea, Where the Salaminian may pop in some morning With a summons. Hast no city in Greece for us? Epops. Why not set forth and plant a colony At the Elean Lepreum? Euelpides. That's a place I have never seen, yet hate it mortally, That leprous Lepreumâfor Melanthius' sake. Epops. Well, there are others, as the Opuntian Locris, Where you might settle. Euelpides. Not a golden talent Should tempt me to become Opuntian. But prythee say what sort of life is this Among the birds? For you must know it thoroughly. Epops. Troth, no unpleasant one. In the first place, We have no need of purses. Euelpides. There's at least then No counterfeit coin, no forging in your country. Epops. As for our diet, 'tis i'th'gardens mostly, On sesamum, myrtles, water-mint, and poppy. Euelpides. You have sweet herbs enough to deck out a wedding. PisthetÃ¦rus. Oh admirable! a rare device hath struck me, A mighty plan. Power, power I see awaiting The generation of the birds, if ye Have but the heart to take my counsel. Epops. Thine? What counsel should we take of thine? PisthetÃ¦rus. What counsel? In the first place I'd have you to leave off Your fluttering every where about and gaping, As a thing not suited to your dignity. With us if one, seeing such flutterers, Should ask, âWhat bird have we here?â Teleas straight Will say, âThe man's a giddy-pated chough, A flutterer, without ballast, without aim, Nor ever biding in one spot an instant.â Epops. Good, good; by Bacchus, we deserve this gibing. What should we do then? PisthetÃ¦rus. Found one common polity. Epops. A polity? prythee, what sort of polity Were that, which should be founded by the birds? PisthetÃ¦rus. What so? Thou'st spoken like a dolt. Look down. Epops. I do. PisthetÃ¦rus. Well: now look up. Epops. 'Tis done. PisthetÃ¦rus. And now Round with thy neck. Epops. Good looking and good luck, By Jove, if that be twisted. PisthetÃ¦rus. Hast seen aught? Epops. Ay: clouds I've seen and sky. PisthetÃ¦rus. And is not this The bird's pole? Epops. Pole? How mean you that? PisthetÃ¦rus. No other, Than as one should say their place. For thus it is That all things by polarity subsist: Therefore 'tis termed pole; which if ye found, And fortify it well, 'twill from that hour, Instead of pole, as hitherto, be your polity; So that ye shall rule men like cockchafers, And starve the Gods out with a Melian famine. Epops. How? PisthetÃ¦rus. Midway earth you know is air. As, therefore We, if we'd go to Pytho, needs must ask Of the BÅotians to afford a passage; E'en so when men make offerings to the Gods, Unless the Gods to you pay tribute, ye Shall not allow the savoury steams to pass, As through an alien state and your own chaos. Epops. Hurrah! Hurrah! By earth and gins and nets and traps, I never heard a cleverer device, So that ye shall found the city jointly with us, Permission first obtain'd of th'other birds. PisthetÃ¦rus. Who then shall broach to them the business? Epops. Thou: For I have taught them, being before barbarians, The use of speech, having been long time with them. PisthetÃ¦rus. How wouldst thou summon them to the meeting? Epops. Easily. For first, I'll shroud me in this thicket here; And then, awaking up my nightingale, We'll call out to them. They, be sure, no sooner Will hear our voice, than they'll come scudding to us. PisthetÃ¦rus. O brave! I love thee, bird, for this. But haste; No tarrying, prythee; enter quick as may be Into the thicket, and wake up the nightingale. Epops. O come, my mate, break off thy slumbers, And round thee fling thy plaintive numbers In a moist, melodious hymn, Warbled from thy brown throat dim: For Itys, our beloved son, Thine and mine, now dead and gone, Fill the forest with thy moaning; Till through the woodbine boughs the groaning Of thy voice to Jove's seat climb, And mingle with the starry chime, Where golden-tressed PhÅbus soon Shall answer in as sad a tune, From his ivory-clasped lyre, That leads in dance the stately quire; And from the blest above shall flow A peal accordant to thy woe. [Some one plays on the pipe. PisthetÃ¦rus. Oh Jupiter! for the voice of that sweet bird! How it hath honied all the thicket round! Euelpides. Ho! PisthetÃ¦rus. What's the matter? Euelpides. Won't you list? PisthetÃ¦rus. For why? Euelpides. The bird prepares to warble out again. Epops. Epopoi! popopo! popoi! popoi! Flock hither, flock hither, flock hither, Hilloah! Hilloah! All ye of like feather, Wherever ye be, Whether barley ye gather, Or seed on the lea; With a skip and a bound, And a song of sweet sound, Flock ye hither to me. Ye that twitter the clod around, Tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, Or in ivy-bush dwell 'Mid gardens; in mountain or dell; Who dip the beak or who brush the wing In reedy pool or in plashy spring; On berries of wilding-olive feed, Or strip off the arbute's scarlet seed, Come along, come along To the voice of my song, Trioto, trioto, trioto, tobrinx; Or on wide fenny flats, Flitting after the gnats, When they're twanging their horn, Snap them up; or at morn, Where the dew lies, are seen Glancing over the green Of sweet Marathon's mead; And with pinion so bright, Hazel-hen, hazel-hen: Or whose tribes take a flight On the tumbling sea-billow, Where the king-fishers pillow, Come hither and hear What news we have here: For all our tribes are gathering, Fowls of every plume and wing: And there is amongst us brought An elder shrewd of subtle thought, That plans new counsels for our state. Come all, and aid the deep debate: Hither, hither, hither. SCENE IV. Chorus, Epops, Euelpides, PisthetÃ¦rus. Chorus. Toro, toro, toro; toro, toro, tinx. Kikkabau, kikkabau, Toro, toro, toro, toli, lilinx. PisthetÃ¦rus. Seest any bird? Euelpides. Not I, by Apollo; none; Though with mouth open I have been staring up. 'Tis all in vain it seems the Epops hath sung, Mocking the sea-lark, in that thicket shrouded. A Bird. Torotinx, torotinx. PisthetÃ¦rus. But, my friend, here at last is some bird coming to us. Euelpides. Yea, by Jove: but what bird? is't a peacock? PisthetÃ¦rus. He'll show us. Epops. He's not one of such as you commonly see; No tame one; but haunts the morasses. PisthetÃ¦rus. Ah me! How with crimson and gold he is all in a flame! Epops. Like enough; and Flamingo indeed is his name. PisthetÃ¦rus. Hilloah! you. Epops. What now? PisthetÃ¦rus. Here's another, I see. Epops. And another, by Jove, as outlandish as he. PisthetÃ¦rus. Who's this strange swelling bird that's so monstrously hideous? Epops. The Median they call him. PisthetÃ¦rus. The Median? Prodigious! And how came he here from so far off a region, With no camel to bear him, this wonderful Median? Euelpides. Here's another again! What a crest he has got! PisthetÃ¦rus. 'Tis strange! There was no other Epops, I thought, But thyself! Yet the same though another is he! Epops. From Philocles he springs as Philocles from me. So I am his grandsire; and we two tally as Hipponicus is son to and father of Callias. PisthetÃ¦rus. In faith, he is Callias: his plumes are so shatter'd. Epops. Ay, just like a lord, that's confoundedly batter'd By women and sycophants, leaguing together, That have stript him so close they scarce leave him a feather. PisthetÃ¦rus. By Neptune, and here comes another that vies With the best of them all in his mutable dies. His name is? Epops. The Glutton. PisthetÃ¦rus. The Glutton? A name, That, Cleonymus only can properly claim. But if 'tis Cleonymus, how has he still That cone on his pate and that red in his gill? Euelpides. But what means this cresting? these caps they have on? Do you think 'tis a race they are going to run? Epops. If a race, 'tis like that of the Carians, who go To their crests, when they're hunted, for safety, you know. PisthetÃ¦rus. But Neptune preserve us! how cursed a crowd Of fowls is collecting! Euelpides. By PhÅbus, the cloud Is so thick, I can scarce see the entrance at present. PisthetÃ¦rus. There's a partridge, I see. Euelpides. Ay, and there is a pheasant. PisthetÃ¦rus. Next a godwit: a kingfisher close at his tail. But who's that behind her? Euelpides. Who is it? her male. PisthetÃ¦rus. What is Sporgilus one of these comical fowls? Then the owl herself comes. Euelpides. Who to Athens brings owls? PisthetÃ¦rus. A tit-lark and magpie, a cuckow and pigeon, A hawk and dive-dapper, woodpecker and widgeon, A turtle and stockdove, an osprey and quail, Chaffinch, bulfinch, teal, linnet, red-moor-hen and rail. Odso! what a screaming and whistling they make! How they sidle and fidget, and noddle and shake! Do you think it's at us they are making this clangor? Alack! how they are gaping! and look as in anger At both you and me! Euelpides. 'Tis too certain, I fear. Chorus. Popopoi! Popopoi! Who hath summon'd us here? What place doth he haunt in? Epops. Behold whom ye seek. I ne'er flinch from my friends, and am ready to speak. Chorus. Titi, tititimptrou! Pray tell us at once What good tidings it is that thou hast to announce. Epops. A plan, safe, just, pleasant, and good for the state, Two shrewd counsellors come to propose for debate. Chorus. Where are they? where are they? what sayst? Epops. I have told. 'Tis a matter of moment they have to unfold, These twain, who are come from the dwellings of men: 'Tis a root ye may peck at and peck at again. Chorus. In my life I ne'er heard so audacious a fact. What is itâ Epops. Nay, quake not. Chorus. Thou'st dared to transact? Epops. All I have done is to offer a courteous greeting To two men who are heartily friends to this meeting. Chorus. And hast thou done this? Epops. And rejoice in it too. Chorus. And where are they? Epops. With us, if myself am with you. Chorus. Ah! I'm lost, I'm undone By my comate, and one With whom I was brought up together; He's abandon'd our cause, And has broken the laws That bound all the tribes of the feather. With unholy deceit He has practised a cheat, That henceforward our friendship will sever; And betray'd me to those Whom I deem'd my worst foes, And have lived with in enmity ever. With the bird for his crime we will presently deal: But these seniors meanwhile our just vengeance shall feel: Our doom is to rend them asunder. PisthetÃ¦rus. We're gone. Euelpides. And thou art the cause of these evils alone. For, why didst thou bring me? PisthetÃ¦rus. To be my attendant. Euelpides. Say, rather to weep. PisthetÃ¦rus. Thou'rt mistaken, depend on't. No such fate will be thine. Euelpides. And what moves thee to doubt? PisthetÃ¦rus. For how shouldst thou weep, if thine eyes be pluck'd out? Chorus. Ho! onward! advance! On every side glance Your pennons, and clip them about: So our vengeance shall strike On each caitiff alike, And they both shall be food for our snout. Up the shadowy steep, Through the billowy deep, O'er the measureless wilds of the air, They may flee us; in vain; We will chase them, and strain Every nerve till we've follow'd them there. No delay; no delay. Haste to rend and to bite. And quick wheel the captain his wing to the right. Euelpides. 'Tis e'en so. Whither, wretch, can I fly? PisthetÃ¦rus. Then remain. Euelpides. What? by these to be torn? PisthetÃ¦rus. Canst thou 'scape being ta'en? Euelpides. I know not the means. PisthetÃ¦rus. Let us face them and stand, Prepared for defence with these pots in our hand. Euelpides. What good will our pots do? PisthetÃ¦rus. They'll scare off the owls. Euelpides. But how shall we deal with those crook-talon'd fowls? PisthetÃ¦rus. Take a spit and have at them. Euelpides. But how for our eyes? PisthetÃ¦rus. A plate or a sauce-boat will amply suffice. Euelpides. What a martial device, thou most dexterous man! Not Nicias himself such inventions could plan. Chorus. Shout, shout, and march on, level bills, linger not; Strike, pluck, pull and rend; and first down with that pot. Epops. Stay thy fury, mad beast; and I charge thee declare What it is that impels thee to murder and tear Two men, who have given no cause for this strife, But are both of them tribesmen and kin to my wife? Chorus. On whom may we vengeance more justly repay? Are the wolves less deserving our mercy than they? Epops. If their nature be hostile, yet friendly their mind, And they come with some scheme for our welfare design'dâ Chorus. For our welfare what scheme should these ever propose, To our fathers of old such inveterate foes? Epops. The wise their best lessons are taught by a foe; For to caution alone we security owe; And that thou couldst never have learnt from a friend. 'Tis instruction for which on our foes we depend. The means they suggest for preserving a nation, Ship-building, manÅuvring, and fortification. Thus to guard all that's dearest our enemies teach. Chorus. We admit of a parley, convinced by your speech. PisthetÃ¦rus. Methinks they're relenting. Chorus. Fall back on your ranks. Epops. 'Tis well: for this measure ye owe me your thanks. Chorus. I dispute not your wisdom; and ever, as now, To its dictates obedient submissively bow. PisthetÃ¦rus. They're for peace, as I wot. Lower dishes and pot. But with spear, I mean spit, Ported thus, it is fit That we walk to and fro Near the arms we forego; And keep them in sight. We must not think of flight. Euelpides. True: but if we should die, Whereabouts shall we lie? PisthetÃ¦rus. We shall sleep with the brave. Ceramicus a grave Will afford us publicly; For, in fight, we will tell Our commander, we fell 'Gainst the foe at OrneÃ¦. Chorus. Retire in order, whence thou cam'st; And, like a soldier heavy-arm'd, Lay down thy wrath, and let it rest Beside thine anger. We the while Of these will question, who they are, And from what clime, And on what errand come. Ho! Epops! on thee I call. Epops. Whereof to be inform'd, desiring, Call'st thou on me? Chorus. Who these and whence? Epops. Strangers from sapient Greece. Chorus. What chance Amid the birds hath brought them here? Epops. Love of the life thou lead'st, thy food, Thyself; to dwell along with thee, And to be with thee wholly. Chorus. Say'st? And what report have they for us? Epops. Things past belief and yet unheard of. Chorus. Discern'st thou any profit, worth the biding, Wherein he hath reliance placed, Desiring to consort with us? Having wherewith to harm a foe, Or benefit a friend? Epops. Of bliss He speaks, enormous happiness, Incredible, untold; for thine, As he affirms, are all things, far, This way and that, as thought can reach. Chorus. Is he one struck with madness then? Epops. I cannot tell thee, how discreet. Chorus. And to discretion adds he wisdom? Epops. For subtleness a very fox; Sheer serpentry; all over craft; The meal thrice bolted not so fine. Chorus. O good! O good! I'd have him speak. Bid him to speak forthwith. Thy words Have set me on the wing. Epops. Now then do thou and thou put off these weapons, [To PisthetÃ¦rus and Euelpides. And to Good Fortune for an offering hang them Close to the lazy-back in your chimney corners. But thou, for what intent I these convened, To them at large unfold; deliver. PisthetÃ¦rus. Nay, Not I, by Apollo, unless they first agree To strike a bargain with me like to that Which that monkey the sword-cutler did with's wife, That they will never bite, or pull, or pokeâ Chorus. What dost thou talk of? Fye. PisthetÃ¦rus. I mean, mine eyes out. Chorus. Done: I agree to 't. PisthetÃ¦rus. I will have thee swear too. Chorus. I swear; so as I hope to win the plaudits Of all these judges and spectators here. PisthetÃ¦rus. Be't so. Chorus. And if I break it, may I haveâ Only the better half upon my side. SCENE V. A Crier, Chorus, Euelpides, PisthetÃ¦rus, Epops. Crier. O yes! O yes! We do proclaim hereby The soldiery take up their arms, and each Unto his home repair; and to hold counsel What next in order shall be issued forth Chorus. Man was deceitful ever, But speak however, For thou perhaps mayst tell Something so wise and clever As shall my simpler thoughts excel; Some worth by me not understood, Which in me thou canst spy; Reveal it for the common good; And thou shalt share no less than I. Whatever the device be that thou hast to produce, Unfold it here without a fear lest we should break the truce. PisthetÃ¦rus. My appetite is sharp, by Jove; my plan is ready kneaded; I've thy good leave to end the batch, and that is all was needed. My boy, go bring the garland, and set the water flowing To lave our hands withal. Euelpides. What then? To dinner are we going? PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jove, but I've a feast prepar'd; 'tis some time since I plann'd it; A most superb and dainty speech: I know they'll not withstand it. Great grief comes o'er me, such as in vain I would keep under, Rememb'ring ye were kings. Chorus. We kings? Of what, i'th'name of wonder? PisthetÃ¦rus. Of all; of him; of me; nay more, of him that rules the thunder. Ye were before old Saturn; before the Titans, ye, And earth. Chorus. And earth? PisthetÃ¦rus. By PhÅbus, ay. Chorus. By Jove, 'tis news to me. PisthetÃ¦rus. For why? Thou lackest learning; incurious art beside, And never yet to Ãsop thy talons hast applied. He told how first the lark was born before Creation's birth: How of disease his father died; as yet there was no earth: Five days he lay unburied: the fifth the duteous bird, His sire, for want of other grave, in his own head interr'd. Chorus. Troth now the father of the lark lies dead in CephalÃ¦. PisthetÃ¦rus. If then more ancient than the earth and than the gods are ye, By eldership you justly claim the kingdom for your own. Chorus. And shall not to the woodpecker Jove straightway yield his throne? Euelpides. At least your bill I'd have you fill in right of this dominion. PisthetÃ¦rus. No lack is there of proofs to show the truth of our opinion; That birds, not gods, o'er men the kings and sovereigns were of yore. And first I instance in the cock, how he the sceptre bore; How long before their monarchs old the Persians him obey'd, Or ere Darius yet was born, or Megabyzus sway'd. And so he's nam'd the Persian bird. Euelpides. And still he struts, you see; Nor other bird there is that wears the turban cock'd but he. PisthetÃ¦rus. He was so potent and so great, so far and wide renown'd, E'en yet when he of all the birds his matin song doth sound, In memory of his former might men start up to their labours, All slipshod in the dark for speed, all vying with their neighbours; Tinkers and tanners, shoemakers, and bagnio-boys and bakers, Army-accoutrementâboss'd-shieldâand baby's fiddle-makers. Euelpides. Ask me of that, who waken'd once by this same matin-bell, Did lose my cloak of Phrygian wool, as ruefully befel. To some child's tenth-day I had had a friendly invitation, And o'ernight in the city made a somewhat free potation; So fell asleep; ere others supp'd, when he begins to crow, I think it dawn, and up start I towards Alimus to go: But scarcely have I poked my neck outside the city wall When a pickpocket with his club salutes my back: I fall: And lo! he has filch'd my cloak away before I've time to bawl. PisthetÃ¦rus. Among the Grecians then, it was a kite that wore the crown. Chorus. Among the Grecians? PisthetÃ¦rus. Ay; he taught them to fall down In homage when the kites appear'd. Euelpides. By Bacchus, that prostration Cost me a penny once when I my humble adoration Offer'd at sight of a noble kite. For as I lay supine With mouth agape, unwares I gulp'd and swallow'd down the coin. The bag took nothing home that day to fill this paunch of mine. PisthetÃ¦rus. Of Egypt and PhÅnicia all, the cuckoo was the king: And when the cuckoo cried Cuckoo, he made them forth to spring, PhÅnicians all, and gather in the barley to the bield. Euelpides. Then he said true, who said, âCuckoo: the circumcis'd afield.â PisthetÃ¦rus. And they in every state maintain'd such absolute command, That rule whatever monarch might in any Grecian land, Whether he Menelaus or great Agamemnon were, A bird upon his sceptre sate in all his bribes to share. Euelpides. Of this I never knew before; and yet have wonder'd too What with one Priam in the play that bird should have to do. I see he stood observing when Lysicrates was bribed. PisthetÃ¦rus. But here's the strangest thing of all, that Jupiter's described (He that's now king) sustaining an eagle on his noul; PhÅbus, like servant, hath his hawk; and Pallas hath her owl. Epops. By Ceres, that is well observ'd. And why there are they placed? PisthetÃ¦rus. Why, but that when a victim's slain they first the guts may taste? Not by the Gods but birds to swear it was of old the use; And even now when Lampon cheats he sweareth âby the goose.â So great and holy were ye then; but now, oh strange abuse! They like to slaves or madmen treat ye; Shoot you in temples if they meet ye; Lime twigs; hunt bushes, brakes, and briars; Lay snares, gins, meshes, traps, and wires: Then every fowler, who so cozens, Sells you in markets strung by dozens; The buyers feel ye, if ye're plump, Pinching your belly, breast, and rump; Nor after, when ye've this endured, They set you on plain roast and skewer'd, But rub together in a trice Scraped cheese, oil, vinegar, and spice, With other sauces, rich and hot, Pour'd on you steaming from the pot; Preserve and pickle, souse and gum ye, Like tainted carcase of a mummy. Chorus. Grievous, right grievous are the words That thou hast spoke, O man! So that I weep, rememb'ring The cowardice of my fathers, Who have these honours, which thou tell'st Deliver'd down from ancestors remote, In me dissolved. Yet thou art come, Not without aid divine and fav'ring chance, A saviour to me. Therefore I to thee My callow nurselings and myself Committing, will henceforward dwell. But thou must say what's fit to do. For life to us were vain, Unless we used all means to win our kingdom back again. PisthetÃ¦rus. First then I teach that of the birds the state must be but one; Then all the air be wall'd about with bricks, like Babylon. Epops. Cebriones! Porphyrion! What a dreadful fortifying! PisthetÃ¦rus. Next back the government from Jove demand, which he denying, Through want of will, or ignorance, then send him your defiance, A holy war proclaim, and name yourselves the Grand Alliance. Say that the Gods no more shall pass, when hot on their amours, To their Alopes or Semeles through any tract of yours. And next another bird express I'd have you send below, To tell mankind that 'tis the birds have got the kingdom now; And bid them first to birds henceforth their sacrifices pay, And next to Gods, assigning each their victims as they may. If Venus hath her offering, the coot shall barley take; To Neptune if the swine be slain, then wheat befits the drake; If Hercules his ox, the gull must have his ploughman's cake; And if the shrine of Jove the King, a slaughter'd ram shall stain, To the Goldencrown, a kingly bird, be first a male-ant slain. Euelpides. The male-ant slain delights my heart, though Jove his thunder plies. Epops. But how shall men believe that we are Gods and not magpies, Seeing we've wings, and flit about? PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jove, ye're sadly out. For Hermes, though a God, hath wings, and flits like you about: And many more. So Victory soars on wings of gold; and Love. And Homer says that Iris is like to a trembling dove. Epops. Ay, and Jove's lightning too hath wings. Fear'st not at thee 'twill fly? PisthetÃ¦rus. But if they you for nothing take, and them for Gods on high, Straight let a cloud of sparrows rais'd, their seed, when sowing, eat; And when they're hungry, Ceres then may measure out their wheat. Euelpides. By Jove, not she: she'll only give apologies enow. PisthetÃ¦rus. And when their sheep are in the fold, and cattle at the plough, At them a flight of crows despatch to peck their eyes; and see Whether Apollo can cure them; for so he gets his fee. Euelpides. Nay, not at least till I first sell my little team. [Aside. PisthetÃ¦rus. But thee If men deem Saturn, Life and Earth, and Neptune and the Sun, All blessings shall await them then. Chorus. I prythee mention one. PisthetÃ¦rus. First then the locusts of their vines shall not destroy the bloom; For them one troop of horned owls shall utterly consume. The gnats and midges next no more upon their figs shall prey; But one great herd of thrushes come and sweep them all away. Epops. But wealth, which most of all they prize, whence that may we bestow? PisthetÃ¦rus. These, by prophetic signs, to them shall mines and metals show, And tell the augur how, by sea, a thriving trade to drive, That not a soul be lost. Epops. Ay? How shall they be kept alive? PisthetÃ¦rus. When they consult the augury, some bird shall still declare, âNow sail ye not; 'twill be a storm. Sail now; it will be fair.â Euelpides. I'll buy a brig and man her straight. With you I would not bide. [Aside. PisthetÃ¦rus. And they of yore too underground their treasures used to hide. These will they show who know where pots of silver lie interr'd; For 'tis what all men say, âNone knows my treasure but a bird.â Euelpides. I'll sell my brig and buy a spade, and by my digging live. [Aside. Epops. But how shall these grant health? for this the Gods do only give. PisthetÃ¦rus. If in the world they're well to do, is this not health, I pray? None that is ill at least has health: thus much I'm bold to say. Epops. How shall they reach old age? for that's another gift of Heaven. Or must they die being children? PisthetÃ¦rus. By the birds there shall be given Three hundred years of added life, by Jove. Epops. How so? PisthetÃ¦rus. How so? Kenn'st not five races of mankind outlives the babbling crow? Euelpides. Tut! tut! What's Jove to these for king, I should be glad to know? PisthetÃ¦rus. Far better these: they want no roof Of pillar'd temple, massy-proof: For them no gorgeous doors unfold Their valves inlaid with molten gold. In shrubs and bosky hedge they dwell, Their costliest shrine an oaken dell. In sacrifice to their blest power We need but seek some olive bower; Not traverse hills or pass the main To Delphi's steep or Ammon's fane: Under the arbute's glossy shade, Or arch by wilding berries made, Oft will we take our wonted stand With wheat or barley; there the hand Raise up to them in simple prayer That we some good of life may share; And they these gifts to us will deal, Scattering but a little meal. Chorus. Lov'd elder, thou, the dearest now, though lately held a foe, It ne'er can be that willingly thy purpose I forego. By thy counsel upheld, I have threaten'd and swell'd, And my solemn oath take, That if thou wilt stake Thy word pledg'd in verity And holy sincerity. To aid and abet us 'Gainst all who shall let us, And with us to fight 'Gainst the Gods for our right, They shall speedily try whose cause is the stronger, Nor handle our sceptres much longer. Whatever must by force be wrought, for this array'd are we; What asks the help of subtler thought all that be left to thee. Epops. And by great Jove I swear no time is now Left us for nodding or for Niciasizing. Something must be done and quickly; and do ye first Enter into my nest, and take possession Of such poor chips and litter as is there. And how they call you, tell us. PisthetÃ¦rus. Most readily. My name is PisthetÃ¦rus. Epops. And what his? PisthetÃ¦rus. Euelpides from Thria. Epops. I give you both The greeting. PisthetÃ¦rus. We accept it. Epops. Now then in. PisthetÃ¦rus. So; do thou take and lead us. Epops. Onward: come. PisthetÃ¦rus. But, sir, we must hark back a little first. Epops. Come, let me see. PisthetÃ¦rus. Inform us, pray, how shall we Consort with you, who're wing'd, being ourselves wingless? Epops. Well thought of. PisthetÃ¦rus. Look ye now, there is in Ãsop Some history 'bout a fox; how ill he fared once Keeping an eagle's company. Epops. Nay: fear nothing. There's a certain tiny root, which having eaten, Ye shall be wing'd straight. PisthetÃ¦rus. Enough: let us proceed. Come, Xanthias! Manodorus! The names of two slaves. take our stuff. Chorus. Hilloah! I call thee; thee, I say. Epops. Why call'st? Chorus. That thou shouldst take These gentlemen along with thee, and feast them for my sake. But bring out here the silver-ton'd sweet Muse's nightingale; And leave with us that we awhile ourselves with her regale. PisthetÃ¦rus. Herein, by Jove, I beg thee gratify them. Bring from the rushes forth the darling bird; By the Gods, bring her forth; that we too may be Spectators of the nightingale. Epops. Be't so, If that's your pleasure also. Procne, come forth; And show thyself to these good strangers here. PisthetÃ¦rus. O precious Jupiter! what a sweet birdling! How delicate too and white! Euelpides. In troth, in troth, I'm fall'n in love with her already, I. PisthetÃ¦rus. What a golden down, even as a maiden, hath she! Euelpides. Nay, I shall never keep from kissing her. PisthetÃ¦rus. Thou miserable fellow, dost not see She has a bill of two spikes to run through thee? The actress wears, for a mask, the head and beak of a bird. Euelpides. Then shelling her like an egg, by Jove, I'll pull The rind from off her poll, and kiss her so. Epops. Let us be going. PisthetÃ¦rus. Lead on; and luck befriend us. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Chorus. Chorus. O gentle bird of auburn wing, Gentlest and dearest, that dost sing Consorting still with mine thy lay, Lov'd partner of my wild-wood way, Thou'rt come, thou'rt come; all hail! all hail! I see thee now, sweet nightingale. Low twittering lead thy pipe along; Then sudden in a spring-tide song Burst out the descant bold and free Of anapÃ¦stic minstrelsy. Oh come, ye men, ye brittle things, mere images of clay, Ye flitting leaves, ye shadowy shapes, ye creatures of a day, Poor, wingless, wretched mortals ye, like nothing but a dream; Give heed to us, and list for once to an immortal theme. Immortals we, and live for aye, from age and sorrow free; Our mansion in the viewless air; our thoughts, eternity. Come learn from us, for we can tell ye secrets most sublime, How all things are; and birds exist before the birth of time; How Gods and Hell and Chaos rose, and mighty rivers sprang; Come learn aright;âand then from me bid Prodicus go hang. First Chaos was and Night and Hell and Tartarus profound; But Earth was not, nor Sky nor Heaven; so Hell withouten bound Stretch'd forth his bosom dark and deep, by windy tempests blown, When first of all black-winged Night doth lay an egg thereon. In circling hours thence Love was born, an infant heavenly-fair, Glittering his back with golden wings, and fleet as eddying air; With winged Chaos mingling he, amid the gloomy Night, In Tartarus our kind did hatch, and brought us first to light. Till then the immortal race was not, ere Love commingled all; But from the mingling Heav'n was made, and sea and earthy ball; And hence the incorruptible kind of all the blest above; We of those blest the eldest far, undoubted seed of Love. For why? We flit with wings about, and are with lovers still, And many a maiden coy have won to do her wooer's will: One with a quail will oft prevail upon his mistress dear; One sends a moor-hen; one, a goose; another, chanticleer. And, from the birds to mortals, all their chief of blessings flow. To them the coming seasons, we, spring, winter, autumn, show. To bid them sow, the clamouring crane hies o'er the Libyan deep, And tells the mariner to hang his rudder up and sleep; Orestes too, by him forewarn'd, will think of honest labour, And weave a coat, that when he quakes, he may not strip his neighbour. Another season next the kite announcing, hastes to tell When sheep in spring-time should be clipp'd. Next when 'tis fit to sell The coat of frize, and buy a frock, that learn ye from the swallow. Your Ammon we and Delphi are, Dodone and Apollo. So ye to birds do ever turn for oracles divine; Whether ye barter, money make, or holy wedlock join: Nor aught there is, by augury, but for a bird may pass; A word; a sign; a sound; a sneeze; a servant or an ass. Be honest then; at once declare, That we your genuine PhÅbus are. Own us your Gods; and for all uses We'll serve you well, priests, prophets, muses; For gentle seasons, summer breezes, When spring relents, or winter freezes; Not turn away and sit above 'Mid clouds with solemn airs like Jove: Present, all gifts we'll bring to you, Your children and your children's children too: Wealth and peace, and flowing treasure, Health and joy, and youth and pleasure, Love and laughter, smiles and silk, The young reader should be apprized that this is an addition made by the translator to the luxuries promised by the birds, and that it was not in use at that time among the Greeks. Song, feast, dance, and pigeon's milk; That ye shall sink opprest with plenty: So to your heart's ease we'll content ye. Muse, that from the forest brinks Thy liquid measures oft dost trill, Tio, tio, tio, tinx: With whom I wont to rove Through glen or grove, Tio, tio, tio, tio, tinx: Then to the mountain-tops we hie, On an ash-tree wildly swinging, To Pan our holy numbers singing; Or from brown throat, strained high, Warbling forth loud melody To the Mountain Mother, fill The woods with songs, her sacred dances leading; Tototo, tototo, tototo, totinx: Whence like a bee, On ambrosial numbers feeding, Phrynichus hath borne away Notes t'imbue his dulcet lay. Come, ye mortals, whoever would flee melancholy, Come and live with the birds, and your lives shall be jolly. Whate'er the laws yonder forbid you to do, With us is allow'd, and commendable too. Though with you 'tis unlawful to beat one's own father; We not only excuse, but approve of it rather, If any one runs at his father, and smiting Cries, âThere, take a spur, if ye're ready for fighting.â If any's a run-a-way, branded and freckled, With us he's a guinea-fowl, curiously speckled. If a Phrygian you there, base as Spintharus deem one, He'll here be a finch, of the race of Philemon; If a slave and a Carian, like Execestides, With us he may choose what forefathers he please: And if Pisias's son have to outlaws unbarr'd The gates, which his city had given him to guard, Let him be a partridge, his father's own brood; For a partridge may scamper where'er he sees good. E'en thus the swans their notes do raise, Tio, tio, tio, tio, tinx, And a tuneful clamour mix, While every pinion creaks; As in Apollo's praise, Their random rout and revelry, Tio, tio, tio, tio, tinx, On Hebrus' banks they ply; Tio, tio, tio, tio; Till up the clouds the clamour raves, And every beast, ounce, leopard, lynx, Hears it and shrinks; And the hush'd Ã¦ther stills her waves, Tototo, tototo, tototo, totinx. An answering peal rings out From all Olympus; and the kings, strange wonder Seizes, as in melodious thunder Graces Olympian and Muses shout Tio, tio, tio, tinx. Of all the commodious and delicate things There's none to compare to a good pair of wings. If you, my spectators, had got them full grown, How many advantages then were your own! If any among you were hungry, and tired Of some tragedy's chorus, his dinner desired, He might spread them at once, and with ease fly away To his home, take a mouthful, and back to the play. Or if some Patroclides among you should know A need more ignoble that urged him to go, 'Twere well he were off, not a soul would complain Of his absence, nor fret till he flew back again: Or if in the boxes some spark should discover His mistress's husband, the fortunate lover Might flutter his plumes, give the dame an embrace, And ere any had miss'd him, be back in his place. Oh surely the value of wings must be great, When with wicker ones only Diitriphes late To rise to the top of our knights has been able, From nothing grown great, and the cock of the stable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. PisthetÃ¦rus, Euelpides, Epops. PisthetÃ¦rus. Here 'tis; the very thing. Ha! ha! by Jove, A droller business never yet saw I. Euelpides. What dost thou laugh at thus? PisthetÃ¦rus. At what? Thy pennons. Know'st what thou'rt likest to, now thou art fledg'd? To an ill-pictur'd goose. Euelpides. And thou to a blackbird Having his pate pluck'd. PisthetÃ¦rus. There then we've our likenesses, As Ãschylus says, âtaken not by others' plumes, But by our own.â Epops. Come, come; what's to be done next? PisthetÃ¦rus. First we must put a name upon the city, Some great and famous one; then after this To the Gods make sacrifice. Epops. I'm of your mind. PisthetÃ¦rus. Well, let me see. What shall our city's name be? Will you we go to LacedÃ¦mon for it, And put a noble name upon herâSparta? Epops. Hercules! I'd not put Sparta on my city; Nor on my pallet not a Spartan girth, If I had one of reeds. PisthetÃ¦rus. What shall we choose then? Epops. We'll take one hence; even from the clouds and these Meteorous regions. PisthetÃ¦rus. Something grand, I warrant, And swelling. Cuckoocloudland. Will that do? Epops. O famous! famous! Thou'st found out a name That's passing fine, an excellent good name. Euelpides. And is not this the very Cuckoocloudland Where great part of Theagenes' estate lies, And all of Ãschines'? PisthetÃ¦rus. Ay, and fitliest too, Or on the plains of Phlegra, where the Gods O'ershot the giants in their swaggering. Epops. It goes on nicely, does this city. What god Shall have the guard on't? Whom shall we comb the veil for? PisthetÃ¦rus. Why should we not let tutelary Pallas? Epops. And how may that be a well-order'd city, Wherein a female is the god, and stands, Having full armour on, while Clisthenes Handles the shuttle? PisthetÃ¦rus. Who shall be president O'er the Pelargic fortress? Epops. Who but the bird Of Persian breed, that every where is call'd The fiercest chick of Mars? Euelpides. O chicken-master! What a fit god were he to man our battlements! PisthetÃ¦rus. For thee, be't thine to tread with nimble step To the air, and minister unto the builders; Fetch pebbles; strip thee, and stir well the mortar; Carry the hod up; slip adown the ladder; See that the sentinels be duly set; Cover the embers; run round with the larum; And sleep there: send besides a messenger, One to the Gods, another from aloft To men below; and thence again to me. Euelpides. But thou stay here the while, andâtake from meâ Curse on thee! PisthetÃ¦rus. To thine errand straight, good sir. Of these things nought may without thee be done. [Exit Euelpides. But I, that to the new Gods I may sacrifice, Will call the priest to lead a solemn pomp. Boy! boy! lift up the basket and the ewer. Chorus. My will, mine aid, mine arm is thine, In these thy holy rites to join With stately march toward the shrine, Which, in mark of grace beside, Shall be with blood of victim dyed. Loud, loud the Pythian shout ascend In honour of the power divine; And ChÃ¦ris notes accordant blend. SCENE II. PisthetÃ¦rus, Epops, Priest. PisthetÃ¦rus. Truce with thy puffing. Hercules! What have we here? What's this? By Jove, I have seen strange things many, But never yet a crow with mouthpiece on. Epops. Priest, to thine office. Let the sacrifice To the new gods proceed. Priest. It shall be done. But where is he that hath the basket? Now; Do ye with prayer and solemn rite On Ornitheian Vesta call, And on the guardian kite, And birds Olympian all, To all of either gender, Their due devotion render: And in loud anthems sing. PisthetÃ¦rus. Hail, Sunian hawk! all hail Pelargick king! Priest. And to the Pythian swan all hail! And to Latona, mother quail; And to the goldfinch, goddess Delian. PisthetÃ¦rus. Diana, goldfinch now, no more ColÃ¦nian. Priest. To the Sabazian chaffinch sing; And to the mighty ostrich, Of gods and men the mother. PisthetÃ¦rus. O Cybele! O lady ostrich! Of Cleocritus the mother! Priest. That to the Cuckoocloudlanders They would health and safety bring, To them and to their heirs, And eke unto the Chians too. PisthetÃ¦rus. Now that 'tis hits my fancy, âEke unto The Chians too.â Never leave out the Chians. Priest. To heroes, birds, and sons of heroes; And to moor-hen and pelican; And shovel-bill and wagtail; And heathcock and peacock; And barn-owl and screech-owl; And red-game and moor-game; And green-finch and pie-finch; And wren, cock and hen. PisthetÃ¦rus. Enough, enough; confound thee to the crows. No more invoking. To what sort of sacrifice, Ospreys and vultures, art inviting thus? And dost not see, thou miserable thing, One kite would snatch all up, and away with it? Off with thee, crowns and all. For I myself Will to these Gods do sacrifice alone. Priest. Yet once more for thee still must I Breathe out a second melody Over the ewer, a holy shout Ascending up from heart devout; And call again upon the blest, Yet only one, to share the feast: If add some savoury meat ye can; For this is nought but husks and bran. SCENE III. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Poet. PisthetÃ¦rus. Thus sacrificing offer we our vows To the wing'd Gods. Poet. âCuckoocloudland's praise to sing, Strike, O Muse, the sounding string.â PisthetÃ¦rus. What have we here? Whence dost thou drop from? Eh? What art thou? Poet. âOne, who shed the chords along, Torrents of mellifluous songâ In the Muses' service I:â As Homer hath it. PisthetÃ¦rus. What! in service? Yet pluming thyself so much on thy tresses? Poet. Not so; no. But âall minstrels we In the Muses' service be:â As Homer hath it. PisthetÃ¦rus. Troth, and thy jacket has seen service too. But, poet, what brings thee hither with a vengeance? Poet. I have made odes upon your Cuckoocloudlands, Odes, Cyclian melodies, many and beautiful, Songs to be sung by virgins, and in the gusto Of Simonides. PisthetÃ¦rus. Ay? and how long is't, prythee, Since thou hast made them? Poet. Oh some time, some time 'Tis since I've tuned my lyre to exalt your city. PisthetÃ¦rus. What? Am not I e'en now employ'd i'th'rites, The sacred rites, that tend the naming on't, Like to an infant's naming on his tenth day? Poet. But âswift the report of the Nine, Like the many-twinkling feet Of horses fleet. And thou, O sire, Founder of Ãtna; yea, a title thine, Derived from holiest things divine, Give what thou wouldst thyself desire: The tinkling wire I wake, And that, which tinkleth, take.â PisthetÃ¦rus. A mischief this we shall have trouble enough with, Unless we give him somewhat, and so rid him. Ho! thou'st a jerkin and a coat upon thee, [To one of the attendants. Strip and impart to this sweet poet. Here, Take thou this jerkin; thou seem'st chill; 'twill warm thee. Poet. âNot loth the Muse admits the boon: And thou in turn A word of Pindar learn.â PisthetÃ¦rus. The fellow's not so easily despatch'd. Poet. âO'er Scythia's wild untrodden ways, Straton with savage herdmen strays; Yet ah! he hath possest No interwoven vest. Inglorious and a prey to scorn, The jerkin is, I ween, That without coat is worn. Thou knowest what I mean.â PisthetÃ¦rus. I know thou wouldst fain have the coat beside. Well; strip: for we must needs oblige the poet. And now thou'st got it, quick, be off. Poet. I'm gone: Yet at departing one more strain will utter Upon this blessed city. âO thou, that sitt'st in golden chair, Her mighty praise declare. Frigid, teeth-chattering, pure serene, Smit with eternal snows, The ever-fruitful scene, O'er which my step admiring goes. Io PÃ¦an! Io PÃ¦an!â Thank Jupiter, however, I have 'scaped This pure serene by the warm coat they've given me. [Exit the Poet, wrapping the coat about him. PisthetÃ¦rus. This was, by Jove, a curse I little dreamt of, That such a scurvy fellow should so speedily Have of our city gain'd intelligence. Again take up the ewer and pace around. SCENE IV. Priest, PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Prophet. Priest. Good omens wait us. Prophet. Stay, I charge thee lift not Thy hand upon the victim. PisthetÃ¦rus. And what art thou? Prophet. What I? A prophet. PisthetÃ¦rus. I would that thou wert hang'd. Prophet. O sir! of things divine be not so reckless. There is an oracle of Bacis extant, That plainly doth regard the Cuckoocloudlands. PisthetÃ¦rus. And why then didst not thou deliver it, Ere I this city founded? Prophet. The divinity Forbade me. PisthetÃ¦rus. Well, well; after all is said, There's nothing like hearing the verses. Out with them. Prophet. âWhen leagued together wolves and hoary crows, Their seat, 'twixt Sicyon and Corinth, choose.â PisthetÃ¦rus. And what is Corinth to me, or I to Corinth? Prophet. Thus Bacis enigmatically meant the air. âFirst to Pandora of all powers on high, A ram with snowy fleece the altar dye. But on my prophet, first of all, a boon Grateful bestow,âclean raiment and new shoon.â PisthetÃ¦rus. What, and are âshoonâ in it? Prophet. Take the book. âA goblet give, with entrails fill his handââ PisthetÃ¦rus. And are the entrails there too? Prophet. Take the book. âAnd if thou dost, brave boy, what I command, An eagle shalt thou soar in realms above. No eagle else, nor woodpecker nor dove.â PisthetÃ¦rus. What, and is all this written? Prophet. Take the book. PisthetÃ¦rus. The oracle in nought resembles one, Which from Apollo's I have here transcribed. âWhene'er upon the rites there shall intrude, Unask'd, a fellow impudent and lewd, Who of the entrails shall demand a share, Give him some blows between the shoulders bare.â Prophet. Poh! Poh! Thou'rt trifling with me. PisthetÃ¦rus. Take the book. âSpare not, were he an eagle, my brave son, Lampon or great Diopithes, lay it on.â Prophet. What, and is all this written? PisthetÃ¦rus. Take the book. What, wilt thou not be off with thee? [Beating him. Prophet. Mercy! Mercy! PisthetÃ¦rus. Take to thy heels, and prophesy elsewhere. [Exit Prophet. SCENE V. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Meto. Meto. I am come among you. PisthetÃ¦rus. Here's another scoundrel! âWhat thou to do? by what idea prompted? What thought impels? what buskin leads thy way?â Meto. My wish is to mete forth the air unto you, And lay it out in due departments rang'd. PisthetÃ¦rus. The Gods preserve us! What i'th'world art thou? Meto. I? I am Meto, not unknown to Greece And to Colonus. PisthetÃ¦rus. Tell me, what hast here? Meto. Rules for the air. For that in figure wholly Doth to an oven most resemblance bear. Therefore (observe me) I applying upward This bent rule to it; putting in the compassâ You understand meâ PisthetÃ¦rus. Nay, I understand thee notâ Meto. Do measure it with a straight rule so applied As that the circle may be made four square. I'th'midst the forum, then the streets direct Leading to it i'th'midst, so that being circular, As from a star, the rays on every side May verge therefrom direct. PisthetÃ¦rus. A very Thales! Metoâ Meto. Well, sir! PisthetÃ¦rus. Dost know I am thy friend? And if thou take my counsel, thou'lt out of the way. Meto. But what's to fear? PisthetÃ¦rus. There is an alien act Pass'd here, like that in Sparta. Certain blows Are rife i'th'cityâ Meto. What, are ye in factions? PisthetÃ¦rus. Not so, by Jove. Meto. How then? PisthetÃ¦rus. It has been carried, With not a voice dissenting, to drub heartily All impudent fellows. Meto. I must away, by Jove. PisthetÃ¦rus. So that I know not if thou'rt yet in time, For these same fisty cuffs are coming. [Beats him. Meto. Oh! Oh! I'm undone; I'm undone. PisthetÃ¦rus. Did I not tell thee? Forewarn'd I not? Wilt thou not hence, and take A better measure of thyself elsewhere? [Exit Meto. SCENE VI. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, an Envoy. Envoy. Where are my hosts, provided by the state? PisthetÃ¦rus. What spruce and essenced Emperor have we here? Envoy. I'm come an envoy, chosen by the ballot, To Cuckoocloudlands. PisthetÃ¦rus. An envoy? and who sent thee? Envoy. A poor diploma here of Teleas' penning. PisthetÃ¦rus. What then? art willing to receive thy stipend, And without more ado, at once begone? Envoy. Nay, by the Gods, I'd better stay'd at home Attending the debates in Parliament. Mine interest there had been of use to Pharn?ces. A Persian satrap. The envoy is perhaps hinting that for a bribe he would be willing to serve the interests of the new state against his employers. PisthetÃ¦rus. Begone, and take it; for thy stipend's this. [Beats him. Envoy. What mean'st by this? PisthetÃ¦rus. A parliament debate For Pharnaces. Envoy. I call you all to witness That I am stricken being an envoy. PisthetÃ¦rus. Whew! Wilt thou not tramp and carry off thy boxes? This is too bad. They send their envoys hither Before we have even sacrificed to the Gods. SCENE VII. Priest, PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, an Envoy, a Legislator. This is the last of these puppies. If Aristophanes had lived in our days, I doubt not he would have added a Political (Economist to finish the climax. Legislator (reading). âAnd 'tis hereby provided that if one Of Cuckoocloudlands do to an Athenianââ The beginning of a new law which he proposes. PisthetÃ¦rus. What other curs'd diploma's coming now? Legislator. I am a constitution-maker. Laws, Span-new, I come to vend among you. PisthetÃ¦rus. What's this? Legislator (reading). âAnd that the Cuckoocloudlanders do use Like measures, weights, and acts in senate pass'd As the Olophyxians.â PisthetÃ¦rus. Haul will I And fix thee in the stocks anon unlessâ Legislator. Ho! Sir! what ails thee? PisthetÃ¦rus. Wilt not budge with thy laws? Else will I show thee bitter laws to-day. Envoy. I hereby PisthetÃ¦rus cite t'appear At the next spring assize in Court for Wrongâ PisthetÃ¦rus. What so! thou fellow, hast thou still been here? Legislator (reading). âBut if any one drive out the magistrates, And do not, as the column directs, receive themââ PisthetÃ¦rus. Oh! for patience! hast thou too still been here? Envoy. I'll do for thee. I'll lay the damages at Ten thousand drachmas. PisthetÃ¦rus. I'll scatter thy boxes. Legislator. Remember when one night thou didst befoul The column. PisthetÃ¦rus. This is past bearing. Seize him, ho! Wilt not halt, sirrah? Priest. Fitting 'tis that speedily We take departure hence, and to the Gods Complete the unfinish'd sacrifice within. SCENE VIII. Chorus. Semichorus. O'er the wide world now I sway, And my subject realms survey; Mortals all to me shall bring Votive prayer and offering. For the green earth I defend; All her blooming fruitage tend; And, ruthless, slay the ravening brood That lurk within the closed bud, Or with their million fangs devour The chalice of the opening flower, Sit on the trees and suck their fruit, Or mining sap the secret root. Through the damask gardens I Seize the reptile, chase the fly, Whoe'er with harmful power presume To waste the sweets or soil the bloom. Crush'd by my wing the felons lie, And writhing in their mischief die. Whereas this day is issued a new proclamation, Design'd for the safety and good of the nation, That a talent the state to that citizen pays Whoever the Melian Diagoras slays, And another to him who kills over again Any tyrant soe'er that already is slain; We therefore hereby think it fit to declare The rewards that our friends and avengers shall share: A talent to him who among you shall slay The poulterer Philocrates gladly we pay, And four to the man, whosoever he be, That shall take him alive and conduct him to me; For our sparrows he strings and sells seven a penny, Blows our thrushes hung up to be stared at by any; The plumes from the tails of our blackbirds he gathers, And thrusts through their nostrils obliquely the feathers: He catches our doves, and imprisons a troop, Constrain'd to decoy while inclosed in their coop. And we further give notice, if any detain Fowls shut up in his yard, that he loose them again, On pain that yourselves by the birds shall be seiz'd, And shut up to decoy till your thralls are releas'd. Blest the winged tribes that wear No fleece to fend the winter's air: Nor again doth sultry ray Scorch us through the summer day; Bosom'd deep in leafy green Then the flowery meadows screen; While the grasshopper doth sing With his shrill note clamouring, All throughout the livelong noon, Loud and maddening with the sun. When the stormy season raves, Winter I in hollow caves, With the mountain nymphs disporting; Till with spring again resorting Once more to the myrtle bowers, We feed on snow-white virgin flowers, Dallying where the Graces play O'er the garden alleys gay. Ere we further proceed, I have something to say To the judges about the success of our play; What gifts, if the conquest to us they decree, We will grant, such as Paris with envy might see. First then, what 'tis known every judge would like best, The Laurian owls shall with you make their nest; They shall lurk in your purses, the delicate elves, And hatch little coins there as dear as themselves. Next your houses with temples in splendour shall vie, Their roofs crown'd with eagles that gaze on the sky. If in office you're placed, and would aught filch away, Little hawks to your fists shall the rapine convey. And if anywhere you're invited to sup, We will send you such craws as ye scarce can fill up. Not so if the victory to us is denied, To your heads then like statues must plates be applied; For if you're without, though your raiment's like snow, Be sure we'll befoul you wherever you go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, and Messenger. PisthetÃ¦rus. All speeds, ye birds, right fairly with our sacrifice. But from the walls how chances there is come No herald to tell us how things there proceed? But lo! here runneth one, breathing AlphÃ¦us! Messenger. Where, where, where, where, where, where's he, where; where, where's he, where, Where is our archon, PisthetÃ¦rus? PisthetÃ¦rus. Here. Messenger. Our wall is built. PisthetÃ¦rus. 'Tis well; thou sayest well. Messenger. A work most beautiful and most magnificent! So that Proxenides of Bragland, and Theagenes, if their cars should meet, with horses Large as the Wooden, might drive past each other,â So spacious is the breadth. PisthetÃ¦rus. O Hercules! Messenger. And for the length, I measured it myself, An hundred cubits. PisthetÃ¦rus. Neptune! what a size! And who are they that built it of such bulk? Messenger. Birds, not a soul beside: Ãgyptian none, Bricklayer or stone-mason or carpenter; But the birds with their own hands; that 'twas marvelous! From Libya came about three myriad cranes, Who had swallow'd stones for the foundation; these The cornrails with their beaks did chip and hew. The storks, another myriad, bare the bricks; While water to the air from underneath Was brought by sea-larks and each river-bird. PisthetÃ¦rus. And who with mortar serv'd them? Messenger. Herons with hods. PisthetÃ¦rus. And how did they the mortar throw therein? Messenger. That too was managed, sir, most dexterously; For by their feet the geese with understroke As 'twere with trowels cast it in the hods. PisthetÃ¦rus. O what may not by help of feet be done! Messenger. Ay, and the drakes, by Jove, with aprons tuck'd up, Bare bricks; and after them, like serving lads, Flew up with cement in their mouths, the swallows. PisthetÃ¦rus. Who now would pay hired labourers for his work? But let me see: the timber work o'th'wall, Who wrought at that? Messenger. Those carpenter fowls, the hickwalls, Who with their beaks did hack the gates out workmanly, And of their hacking the like sound arose As in a dock-yard. And now all's complete, Gates, bars, and bolts; all strictly guarded round; Watch visited, and larums pass'd; and sentinels Set every where, and beacons on the towers. But now must I run off and wash me. Meanwhile Thyself look to the rest. Chorus. Well, sir, how now? Dost not admire how expeditiously our wall Hath been erected? PisthetÃ¦rus. Yea, by the Gods do I, And most deservedly; for it all, in sooth, Doth seem like falsehoods to me. But hitherward A guard, as seems, from thence despatch'd, a messenger, Comes running towards us, looking fierce defiance. SCENE II. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, and another Messenger. Messenger. Oh! Oh! Alas! Alas! PisthetÃ¦rus. What hap hath chanced? Messenger. Ill, ill; most direful chance: For some one of the Gods, that are with Jove, E'en now, escaping through our gates, hath flown Down into th'air, unnoticed by our guard, The jackdaws, station'd there for daily watch. PisthetÃ¦rus. Which of the Gods? Messenger. We know not; but that 'twas One who hath wings, thus much we know. PisthetÃ¦rus. Behoved not To send forth scouts against them straight? Messenger. That did we; Sent out three myriad hawks, equestrian bowyers; Them, each one, arm'd with crooked talon, joins, Owl, buzzard, vulture, eagle, falcon, kite; With clang and winnowing and rush of wings, All ether is turmoil'd, while they the God Are seeking, who methinks is not far off, But somewhere hereabout lurks even now. PisthetÃ¦rus. Must we not then make ready slings and bows? Haste hither all in battailous array; Draw each his bow; and reach me swift a sling. Chorus. War is afoot, unspeakable war, Waged between me and heaven. Ye, every one, watch well around The air with cloudy girdle bound, Whom Erebus to light did bring; Lest any of the Gods by stealth Passing this way escape. And every one fling round a glance Of eager vigilance. For now, as from some deity sailing near, A winged sound of whirling meets mine ear. SCENE III. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Iris. PisthetÃ¦rus. Hilloah! thou! whither, whither in such haste? Halt; stay thy flight; stand where thou art; advance not. Who art thou? whence? thou shouldst have told ere now. Iris. From the Gods, I, th'Olympians. PisthetÃ¦rus. What thy name? Vessel or herald's cap? Iris has on a petasus, or helmet, with wings, like that worn by Mercury, as it is described by himself in the prologue to the Amphitruo of Plautus: Nunc internosse ut nos possitis facilius, Ego has habebo hic usque in petaso pinnulas. Her resemblance to a vessel is caused by the folds of her robe swelling out like the sails of a ship. Iris. Iris the swift. PisthetÃ¦rus. Paralus or Salaminian? Iris. Why? what's here? PisthetÃ¦rus. Will not some buzzard fly and seize her? Iris. Me? Seize me? And what, the mischief! means all this? PisthetÃ¦rus. O thou shalt have it soundly. Iris. Strange this! Strange! PisthetÃ¦rus. Through what gates hast thou come within our wall, Thou most audacious? Iris. I know not, I, by Jove, Thorough what gates. PisthetÃ¦rus. Heard'st thou that, how she scoffs us? Didst go to th'captain's guard of jackdaws? hast thou The signet from the storks? Sayst? Iris. What? the mischief! PisthetÃ¦rus. Didst take it? Iris. Art i'thy senses? PisthetÃ¦rus. Nor did none O'th'birds that are in command pass thee the sign? Iris. By Jove, wretch! none. PisthetÃ¦rus. And dost thou then in silence Fly through a foreign state and chaos thus? Iris. What other way should the Gods fly? PisthetÃ¦rus. That, by Jupiter, Is more than I can tell; but not by this. And thou'rt e'en now on trespass. Know'st thou not Of all the Irises that ever were, None ever was more justly doom'd to die Than thou, being ta'en thus, if thou'dst thy desert? Iris. But I am deathless. PisthetÃ¦rus. Yet thou shouldst have died. For 'twere intolerable methinks if we O'er others ruled, and you Gods lived as rebels, Nor should acknowledge that to us in turn Allegiance must be paid, as to your betters. But tell me whither are thy pennons bound? Iris. Mine? From the Father down to men,âto bid them Do sacrifice unto the Olympian Gods, Slay victims on our sacrificial shrines, And steam the ways with fat. PisthetÃ¦rus. To what Gods sayst thou? Iris. To what? To us, the Gods in heav'n. PisthetÃ¦rus. Ye! Gods? Iris. And who is God beside? PisthetÃ¦rus. The birds to men Are now the Gods, to whom they must do sacrifice; But, by Jove, not to Jove. Iris. Fool! fool! beware How thou dost stir the terrible mind o'th'Gods, Lest all the generation of ye doom'd To ruin, justice with Jove's spade upset, And sooty blaze thy body, house and all, Resolve to ashes with Licymnian bolts. PisthetÃ¦rus. Hearken thyself. No more of this wild rant: Be still: for whether dost thou think to scare Some Lydian slave or Phrygian with these bugbears? Know'st thou if Jove shall anger me yet more, That I his roofs and houses of Amphion Will with fire-bearing eagles burn to ashes? And up to heav'n flamingos will I send, Porphyrion fowls against him, and all cased In leopard's skins, more than six thousand of them. He knows how one Porphyrion plagued him once. And thou, if thou shalt anger me a whit, Shalt try an old man's prowess, my coy lady. So shalt thou wonder enough, young mistress Wonder! Iris. Thou and thy words be split. Confusion to thee! PisthetÃ¦rus. Whew! whew! wilt not be off? wilt not whirr with thee? Iris. If my father doth not make thee smart for thisâ PisthetÃ¦rus. Gramercy, madam: to some younger spark; And him resolve to ashes an thou wilt. Chorus. Aloud we declare That of Jupiter's Gods None henceforth should dare To pass our abodes. Nor in sacrifice Let a mortal again Presume from his fane To send any incense this way to the skies. SCENE IV. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Herald. PisthetÃ¦rus. Strange if this herald we have sent to men Should ne'er return again! But here he comes. Herald. O PisthetÃ¦rus, excellent PisthetÃ¦rus! O thou discreetest, wisest, famousest, most blest! O bid all here give hearing. PisthetÃ¦rus. Well! What sayst? Herald. Thee with a crown of gold do crown and honour All people for thy wisdom's sake. PisthetÃ¦rus. Accepted. But wherefore honour me the people thus? Herald. O thou, that hast a city most illustrious Founded i'th'air, thou know'st not all the glory Thou'st gain'd from mortals, nor how many lovers Thou of this place hast won; for till the founding Of this state all were LacedÃ¦mon-mad, Wore tresses long, kept fast, went filthily, Acted to the life the part of Socrates, Bare Spartan staffs; but now they have turn'd about, And are grown bird-crazy; mimicking through pleasure Whate'er the birds do. First, as soon as day dawns, All fly together to the courts, like us; And in a herd they flutter to the leaves, And peck and feed away upon decrees Most lustily. Nay, to such a pitch of frenzy Is this bird-mania grown, that many of them Have got fowl names: one fellow, a limping vintner, Is nicknamed Partridge; and as to Menippus, He is entitled Swallow; Opuntius Is Raven the one-eyed; Philocles, Lark; Theagenes, Barnacle; Lycurgus, Stork; ChÃ¦rephon, Bat; and Syracosius, Magpie. For Midias, he is known there commonly By th'name of Quail, since he's most like a quail That by a game-cock has been maul'd and batter'd. Then for the songs they all sing, not one's made Without some swallow in it, or some widgeon, Or may be goose or stockdove; or at least They manage to bring in something about wings Or pinions, be it never such a scrap. So matters go on there. But I can tell you One thing; that we shall have ten thousand of them, Or upwards, coming here to beg for wings And talons; so that from some where or other Wings must be had for these new colonists. PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jove, then, we've no business to stand here. Quick, quick; as many baskets as thou find'st, And all the boxes, fill brimfull of wings. Let Manes fetch the wings out. I meantime Shall be ready to receive them as they come. Chorus. Our city soon may bear the style Of populous. PisthetÃ¦rus. So Fortune smile. Chorus. The ardour for our city grows. PisthetÃ¦rus. Bestir thee; for no time's to lose. Chorus. What is not here that men seek most Who settle on a foreign coast? Wisdom and Love; the Graces three; Ambrosia, and Tranquillity, Breathing from her gentle face Holy calm around the place. PisthetÃ¦rus. How sluggishly thy work is done! Wilt thou not budge? Wilt thou not run? Chorus. Bear some one quick a pannier full Of wings. This fellow is too dull. Go thou, and make him stir for us, The doltish assâlay on him thus. PisthetÃ¦rus. Right, 'tis but Manes; never spare: The coward slave was made to bear. Chorus. First lay the wings in order all; Together place the musical; Next the prophetic; and last these Adapted to the billowy seas. Then carefully each comer scan, And dress in fitting plumes the man. PisthetÃ¦rus. Yea, by the screech-owls, but I can hold off No longer, seeing thee so slack and lubberly. [Beats Manes. SCENE V. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, and a Parricide. Parricide. âOh for an eagle's lofty pinion To bear me with supreme dominion O'er the blue barren ocean's swell!â PisthetÃ¦rus. Well, our reporter seems to have been no false one. Here's one hath set the eagle to a tune. Parricide. O what's so sweet as flying? I'm fall'n in love With the birds' polity. I'm downright bird-mad. I feel a fluttering. I've a longing wish To dwell with you, a vehement coveting for Your laws. PisthetÃ¦rus. What laws? for the birds' laws are many. Parricide. All, all; but most because by them 'tis honourable To throttle one's own father. PisthetÃ¦rus. True, by Jove; They judge it very manly, at the least, If one, being a chick, hath struck its father. Parricide. This is the reason of my settling with you. I long to throttle my father, and have all. PisthetÃ¦rus. But we've an ancient law among the birds ('Tis in the tablet of the storks inscribed), Whenso the father-stork hath nourish'd all His young, and made them able to take wing, That they in turn must yield their father nourishment. Parricide. A pretty journey then I've made, by Jove! If all I've got by coming is, that I Must feed my father. PisthetÃ¦rus. Nay, not so; for since Thou'rt come, poor fellow, with good will here, we Will as an orphan fledge thee. I've besides, Young sir, some counsel for thee, which thou'lt find Not ill, such as my younger days have taught me. Smite not thy father. But here, take this wing; And in the other hand this spur: believe Thou hast a cock's crest on; disgrace it not; Keep watch; serve bravely; be thy pay thy sustenance; And for thy father, let him live: but since Thou art for battling, fly away to Thrace, And there fight. Parricide. This sounds well, at least, by Bacchus! And I'll e'en do't. PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jove, 'twill be thy wisdom. SCENE VI. PisthetÃ¦rus. Chorus, Cinesias. Cinesias. âOn wings fluttering light, To Olympus my flight, Through many a lay, Winds its aery way.â PisthetÃ¦rus. This thing doth want a ballast of stout pennons. Cinesias. âUndaunted the spirit And frame I inherit, That would ever pursue Varied numbers light and new.â PisthetÃ¦rus. We greet the linden lath, Cinesias. Why hast thou hither wheel'd thy limping gait? Cinesias. âMy ambition presumes At sweet Philomel's plumes.â PisthetÃ¦rus. Nay, cease thy warbling. Tell me what thou mean'st. Cinesias. This plainly. I would fain be fledg'd by thee, And soar aloft, and pluck me some new ditties Air-whirled, and snow-smitten from the clouds. PisthetÃ¦rus. What, and could one pluck ditties from the clouds? Cinesias. Our art depends thence; for in dithyrambics The finest things are all aÃ«rial, Shadowy, dim-gleaming, like to viewless plumes That pant and whirl along th'etherial void. But thou shalt have an instance. PisthetÃ¦rus. Nay, not I. Cinesias. By Hercules, but thou shalt; for I will course All air through for thee. âWinged ghosts in airy rank Stretching long necks, lean and lankââ PisthetÃ¦rus. Soho! soho! Cinesias. âOh for a blast of the invisible breeze, My wings to uplift, And send me adrift Wand'ring, wand'ring, wand'ring, Wand'ring o'er the wavy seas!â PisthetÃ¦rus. By Jove, I'll put a period to thy blasts. Cinesias. âNow a southward voyage steering, Now to north my body nearing; Cutting the havenless furrow of the air.â [PisthetÃ¦rus whips him. A tricksy rare device of thine, old gentleman. PisthetÃ¦rus. Does not this whirling suit thy fancy? I thought Thou hadst liked whirling. Cinesias. Is it thus thou dost Misuse the Master of the Cyclian song, Whom all the tribes contend for? PisthetÃ¦rus. Wilt thou stay With us, and be the Master to a Chorus Of flying fowl; cramming the tribe of Cecrops For Leotrophidas? Cinesias. I mark thy jeering. But be assured of this; I will not stop Till I get wings, and cleave the buxom air. SCENE VII. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, an Informer. Informer. âWhat birds are these, with plumes so gay, That live of nought possest? O wide-wing'd swallow, pause, and say, Upon thy speckled breast.â PisthetÃ¦rus. No slight annoyance this that we have stirr'd. Here comes another in the sing-song mood. Informer. âO wide-wing'd swallow, pause again Upon thy speckled breast.â PisthetÃ¦rus. Methinks he hums a catch for his own doublet, That's worn so bare he had need of many swallows To keep the cold out. Informer. Who's he that wings the comers? PisthetÃ¦rus. Here is he. But thou must say what thou'dst have. Informer. Wings, wings. Ask not a second time. PisthetÃ¦rus. Dost think, then, To fly with them direct unto Pellene? Informer. Not so, by Jove. But I am an informer, That seek defaulters through our friendly isles, And summon them to justice. PisthetÃ¦rus. Blessed trade! Informer. Now in this my office of a pettifogger Some wings would serve me well to whir about, When I go round on my citations. PisthetÃ¦rus. And couldst thou cite the better for thy wings? Informer. Not so, by Jove! but that, to avoid pirates, I may return thence with the cranes. The lawsuits I shall have swallow'd down will serve for ballast. PisthetÃ¦rus. Is this thy occupation? is thy youth Employ'd in this vile service of informing? Informer. What should I do? I know not how to dig. PisthetÃ¦rus. But there are other decent ways, by Jove, Which one of thy age should live honestly by, Rather than pandering for the hungry courts. Informer. Good sir, I came for wings, and not for counsel. PisthetÃ¦rus. I now, in thus discoursing, wing thee. Informer. How? Could a man be wing'd with discourses? PisthetÃ¦rus. All are so. Informer. All? PisthetÃ¦rus. Hast thou never heard what every where Fathers do say to the boys in barbers' shops? âMy son is on the wing for chariot-driving, Plague on it! This is what Diitriphes' discourse Has done for him.â Another tells you, âhis Has had his mind fly off to tragedies, And that his thoughts still hover o'er the stage.â Informer. And doth discourse indeed give wings? PisthetÃ¦rus. Believe me, does it; Raises the soul aloft, and lifteth up The very man. And so I now am willing, By good discourse, to give thee wings, and turn To lawful acting. Informer. But I'm not willing, I. PisthetÃ¦rus. What wilt thou do? Informer. I will not shame my breeding. The informer's life is that my fathers left me. Give me then wings, and be they swift and light, A hawk's, or mousing owl's, that having cited Our island friends, and then accused them here, I then again may fly back there. PisthetÃ¦rus. I understand. Thou mean'st it thus: that he should be cast and fined, The islander, ere he come. Informer. Right, right; thou understand'st. PisthetÃ¦rus. Then he sails hither, and thou fly'st back there To seize upon his goods. Informer. Thou hast it all. I must in nothing differ from a top. PisthetÃ¦rus. I understand: a top. And here, by Jove, I have some excellent CorcyrÃ¦an wings. Informer. Mercy! thou hast a whip. PisthetÃ¦rus. And therein the wings, With which this day I'll make thee spin. Informer. Oh mercy! Wretch that I am! PisthetÃ¦rus. Wilt thou not wing thee hence? Wilt not drop off, thou most accursed villain? I'll show thee a twist-whirligig of justice. Come, let us gather up the wings, and go. [Exeunt PisthetÃ¦rus and Informer. Chorus. Many and strange the things, and rare The sights that I have seen, As wide along the tracts of air My devious flight has been. A plant there is that far doth spring From Cardia's sanguine fields, That bears informers' leaves in spring, And sheds, in winter, shields. No other use on earth it knows, Yet fearful is to see; And large of limb, and sturdy grows The Cleonymian tree. Again, there is a place, that light Of torches ne'er invades; O'ercanopied with âdouble night Of darkness and of shades.â The heroes there with men converse, Who to a dinner treat them, Except at eve; but then 'tis scarce Accounted safe to meet them. For the noble parts are stricken sore, And lost, perdye, the vest is Of mortal, at that solemn hour, Who crosses great Orestes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Prometheus, PisthetÃ¦rus. Prometheus. Woe to me, wretch, should Jove set eyes upon me! Where's PisthetÃ¦rus? PisthetÃ¦rus. Heyday! what have we here? What muffling's this? Prometheus. Seest any of the Gods Behind me? PisthetÃ¦rus. Not I, by Jove. But who art thou? Prometheus. What time o'day is't? PisthetÃ¦rus. What time? past noon a little. But who, the mischief! art? Prometheus. Draws it to sunset, Or later? PisthetÃ¦rus. Now I would a murrain had thee! Prometheus. What's Jupiter doing? Clears he off the clouds, Or gathers? PisthetÃ¦rus. Thou be curs'd! Prometheus. So I unmuffle. PisthetÃ¦rus. What thou? my dear Prometheus? Prometheus. Hush! hush! no noise. PisthetÃ¦rus. Why, what's this? Prometheus. Silence, call me not by name. Thou'lt ruin me, if Jove spy me here. But stop, That I may tell thee what's going on above. Take this umbrella; hold it over me, Up thus, that the Gods see me not. PisthetÃ¦rus. Ha! ha! ha! Contrived most providently, and like thyself; But come, step under quick; and now speak boldly. Prometheus. Then hear. PisthetÃ¦rus. I hear: say on. Prometheus. Jove's ruin'd. PisthetÃ¦rus. Eh? How long has he been ruin'd? Prometheus. E'er since ye Have built i'th'air; for of men none do longer Sacrifice aught to the Gods; nor fat of thighs Hath come up to us from that time; but still, As in the Thesmophoria, we keep fast, Having no oblations: and the barbarous Gods, Like starved Illyrians, grind their teeth, and say They will make war on Jupiter from above, Unless he straightway open them the ports, That the carved entrails may have free ingress. PisthetÃ¦rus. Are there then others, barbarous Gods, 'bove you? Prometheus. How should they not be barbarous, who do reign Whence Execestides derives his ancestry? PisthetÃ¦rus. And what name give ye to these barbarous Gods? Prometheus. What name? Triballi. PisthetÃ¦rus. I understand; the word âTroubleâ comes from them. Prometheus. No doubt; no doubt; but one thing I can assure ye of. You'll have coming here Ambassadors to treat about a peace, From Jupiter and these same Triballi; but Do ye grant no conditions, unless Jove Restore the sceptre to the Birds again, And give thee Basilea for thy wife. PisthetÃ¦rus. Who's Basilea? Prometheus. A most lovely girl, Who manufactures thunderbolts for Jove, And, in short, every thing he wants; wise counsel, Good legislating, temperance, dock-yards, Scandal, first Lord o'the'Treasury, and new Mintage. PisthetÃ¦rus. So she's his Major Domo? Prometheus. Ay, believe me; Whom if you only get from him, you've all. And this is what I came to tell you of. For I am still a well-wisher to men. PisthetÃ¦rus. True; thou of all the Gods art the only one That ever taught man how to use the gridiron. Prometheus. And for the Gods, I hate them all, as thou know'st. PisthetÃ¦rus. I'll vouch for thee, by Jove, that thou hast ever Been a thorough God-hater. Prometheus. A pure Timon. But that I may run off back, give me th'umbrella, So that should Jove espy me from on high, He may suppose I'm following the Canephorus. PisthetÃ¦rus. Here: and take up the litter, and pass on. [Exit Prometheus. Chorus. In dark-foot land a lake there rolls Unwash'd and muddy still, Where Socrates evoketh souls By necromantic skill. Pisander came and ask'd to see His own soul, that had gone, Leaving him on this earth to be A man with breath alone. A camel for a lamb he led, In sacrifice to slay; And like Ulysses, while it bled, Did turn his face away. Then up there rose, as quick as thought, And o'er the marish flat, Flickering to the camel's throat, Flew ChÃ¦rephon the bat. This is continuation of the Chorus at the end of the last act. SCENE II. PisthetÃ¦rus, Chorus, Neptune, Triballus, Hercules. Neptune. Here is the city then of Cuckoocloudlands, Thou seest, whereto we are sent on this embassy. But, you sir, how is this? Why wear you thus [To Triballus. Your garment all awry upon the left? Will you not shift it to the other side? What, art thou some LÃ¦spodias in thy shape, Unlucky devil? O democracy, What wilt thou at last come to, if the Gods Have voted in a fellow like to this? Triballus. Wo't not be quiet? Neptune. Hang thee. Never saw I Such a barbarian of a God before. But, Hercules, come, what shall we do? Hercules. You know My sentiments, that I would throttle the rascal, Whoe'er he be, that has wall'd out the Gods. Neptune. Nay, but my good friend, our instructions are To accommodate matters. Hercules. Doubly so am I Disposed to throttle him. PisthetÃ¦rus. Some one hand the cheese-rasper. Bring me the spice. Ho there! I want the cheese. Make the embers burn. Hercules. A hearty greeting to thee, Good man, from us three Gods. PisthetÃ¦rus. Scrape the spice over. Hercules. Pray, what meat is this? PisthetÃ¦rus. Certain fowls, have suffer'd For being 'gainst the commonalty of the birds. Hercules. Do you scrape spice upon them first? PisthetÃ¦rus. Ha! Hercules? Good day to thee. What's thy business? Hercules. We're come here, Commission'd from the Gods to treat of peace. PisthetÃ¦rus. There is not a drop of oil left in the flask. Hercules. And the little things ought to be well basted. Neptune. For we indeed by war are nothing profited; And ye, being on friendly terms with us Gods, Would have rain water always in your cisterns, And would lead halcyon days still. With full powers On all these matters come we. PisthetÃ¦rus. But we neither Began at any time war upon you; And now are willing, if it seemeth fit, And ye're inclin'd to do what else is just, To come to terms. By what is just this mean I; That Jove, to us the Birds, do render back The sceptre; and so let us be reconcil'd. That done, th'ambassadors will please to dine with me. Hercules. O quite sufficient; and I give my vote for't. Neptune. What, thou infatuate! art such a dotard And glutton, thus to dispossess thy father Of his supremacy? PisthetÃ¦rus. But is it so? And will ye Gods not gain increase of power, If birds bear rule below? Now indeed they stoop Under the shelter of the clouds, and swear False oaths; but if the birds were your allies, Should one swear by the Raven and by Jove, And break his oath, the Raven, as he pass'd, Might unawares fly at him, and so peck His eye out at a stroke. Neptune. By Neptune, there is Some truth in that. Hercules. I think so. Neptune. What say'st thou? Triballus. Nabaisetreu. PisthetÃ¦rus. Do you see, how he assents too? There is another thing besides, in which Observe how much advantage we shall do you. If any mortal in his prayers should vow A sacrificial offering to the Gods, And afterwards in cunning sophistry say, âLong-suffering are the Gods,â and pay it not, We will exact the debt with usury. Neptune. How? let me see. PisthetÃ¦rus. Why when this man should chance To count his money up; or sit and bathe; A kite should unaware pounce down, and snatching The value of two sheep, bear it to the God. Hercules. I vote again restoring them the sceptre. Neptune. Now ask Triballus. Hercules. Triballus, what think youâ Of being curs'd? Triballus. Saunaca Backtaricrousa. Hercules. He says I'm quite right. Neptune. Well, if you are both Of that opinion, I shall not hold out. Hercules. Ho! you, we are agreed about the sceptre. PisthetÃ¦rus. There is, by Jove, another thing occurs to me. For Juno, I do give her up to Jove; But, for myself, the damsel Basilea I claim to wife. Neptune. Thou hast no mind to peace. Let us begone home. PisthetÃ¦rus. It's all one to me. Cook, see thou make the sauce sweet. Hercules. My dear Neptune, My best of fellows, what art thou about? Shall we now for one woman go to war? Neptune. What should we do then? Hercules. Do? why let's agree. Neptune. Dost not perceive, thou most unlucky wight, That thou wert miserably gull'd but now? Thou'rt injuring thyself. For if Jove die, Having given up the sovereignty to these, Thou art reduced to poverty. For all the wealth, That Jove shall die possess'd of, falls to thee. PisthetÃ¦rus. Mercy upon me! how he would cajole thee! Come here aside that I may tell thee something. This is mere trick and practice of thine uncle's On thy simplicity. For not a doit, Of all thy father hath, is thine by law. For thou art a bastard and no lawful son. Hercules. A bastard, I? How sayst? PisthetÃ¦rus. E'en so, by Jove, Being of a foreign woman. Else dost think Minerva ever could have been the heiress, Had there been lawful brethren? Hercules. But suppose My father at his death should give me that, Which to one base-born he hath power to give? PisthetÃ¦rus. The law permits it not; for this same Neptune, Who now incites thee, then will be the first To claim thy father's property on the plea That he's a brother born of lawful bed. Nay, thou shalt hear how Solon's law doth run:â âNo bastard doth succeed in right of blood, If there be lawful children. If there be none, Those next of kin partake the inheritance.â Hercules. Have I no share then in my father's goods? PisthetÃ¦rus. None, none, by Jupiter. But tell me this: Hath he enroll'd thee yet among the tribesmen? Hercules. He hath not: at which I, some time, have wonder'd. PisthetÃ¦rus. Why then, no more stare up upon yon heavens With mouth agape, and looking daggers thus. If thou'rt with us, I will appoint thee sovereign, Feed thee on pigeon's milk. Hercules. I've thought some time What thou dost say about the damsel right; And for my part I give her up to thee. PisthetÃ¦rus. How speaks thy judgment? Neptune. My vote is against it. PisthetÃ¦rus. Triballus has the casting voice. How says he? Triballus. De beautiful gran damsel Basilau Me give up to de fool. To the fowl. Hercules. You give her up You say. Neptune. He bids us give her up, by Jove, No more than bids us go, as swallows might. PisthetÃ¦rus. He bids you give her to the swallows then. Neptune. Well, ye're agreed; and ratify the peace. I shall be silent, since it pleases you. Hercules. We have resolved to give you all you ask. But come with us yourself to heaven, that there You Basilea and all else may take. PisthetÃ¦rus. Troth it is very seasonably for the marriage That they have been cut off,âthese. The birds that had been put to death for rising against the new state. Hercules. Would you like me To stay and finish the cooking of these meats? And do you go. Neptune. Finish the cooking? This Is strange love of thy belly. Wilt not with us? Hercules. I had been well disposed of; that's the truth. PisthetÃ¦rus. Here, some one reach me out a wedding robe. [Exeunt. Chorus. On plains Fanatic lives a race, Where Clepsydra impels Her waters with a silent pace Along their secret cells. A crafty tongue serves all their needs, Yet in the belly ligs; It reaps their harvests, sows their seeds, And plucks their grapes and figs. These ventrilinguists are a kind From lands barbarian come, Philips and Gorgiases, that find Too oft with us a home. And yet from such tongue-doughty breeds, Prevails through Attica The custom, when a victim bleeds, To cut the tongue away. A continuation of the last Chorus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Messenger, Chorus, PisthetÃ¦rus. Messenger. O fortunate, beyond expression fortunate, O ye thrice blest, ye winged race of birds, Welcome your king, and to his goodly home Conduct him. For he comes, in brightness such As never darted from all-glittering star In its high dome that beams with radiant gold; Nor ever such a blaze of glory shone From the sun's inextinguishable fire. And in his pomp he leads a bride, how fair No words may tell; and in his hand doth grasp, Brandishing, thunder, the wing'd bolt of Jove. Unutterable odours to the depth Pervade the circle; and from incense sprung, Sweet marvel to behold, the lightsome airs Mount and shave through the wreathed curl of smoke. And lo! himself is here! But now behoves The heavenly Muse should lift her sacred voice. Semichorus. Above, below, beside, around, Let your veering flight be wound. Clasp him with upraised pinion, Fortune's ever-blessed minion. Oh! what beauty! Oh! what grace! Thrice happy thou that dost embrace In holy wedlock thy loved mate, Pride and glory of our state. Semichorus. Mighty the joys that betide This city through him and his bride. Welcome, welcome, with loud glee, Marriage song and jubilee, Him and his beautiful Basilee. Semichorus. T'Olympian Juno's couch of yore, Fates divine in triumph bore Him, whose nod did shake the skies, Join'd in like solemnities. Golden-feather'd Love the while, Beaming forth a heavenly smile, Guided the bending reins O'er the star-sown plains, At those nuptials to preside Of Jove and his imperial bride. To Hymen, Hymen, raise the song; To Hymen, Hymen, yet a louder note prolong. PisthetÃ¦rus. With joy I hear your sacred hymns, With joy your melodies I hear, And rapt delight. But come, call now His own dread earthly thunders forth, And fiery levin-brands of Jove, And the white vollied lightning. Chorus. O thou great golden light of levin-brand, O deathless fiery weapon of Jove's hand, And with thee the deep thunders that do pour A stormy deluge mingling with their roar, That shake e'en now this earthly ball; By thee he reigneth lord of all, Holding his beautiful Basilee, Jove's assessor, won by thee. To Hymen, Hymen, raise the song; To Hymen yet a louder note prolong. Now aloft in mirthful glee Flits our plumed pageantry. Follow all ye tribes, whoe'er With light wings beat the yielding air, Follow, follow now our wedding To Jove's house and to the bedding. Stretch thy hand, O blessed bride, Take my wings and dance with me; Floating upward at my side Thus in airy buoyancy. On! On! Io PÃ¦an! Shout Victory! Victory! O first of immortals! O chief of the sky!</field>
