      <field name="fulltext">ARGUMENT The Erinnyes who appeared to Orestes after the murder of ClytÃ¦mnestra made his life miserable, and drove him without rest from land to land. And he, seeking to escape them, had recourse to the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, believing that he who had sent him to do the work of vengeance would also help to free him from this wretchedness. But the Erinnyes followed him there also, and took their places even within the holy shrine of the Oracle, and while Orestes knelt on the central hearth as a suppliant, they sat upon the seats there, and for very weariness fell asleep.</field>

First, with this prayer, of all the Gods I honour The primal seeress Earth, and Themis next, The succession is, in part, accordant with that in the Theogonia of Hesiod, (vv. 116â136,) but the special characteristic of the Ãschylean form of the legend is that each change is a step in a due, rightful succession, as by free gift, not accomplished (as in other narratives of the same transition) by violence and wrong. Who in due order filled her mother's place, (So runs the tale) and in the third lot named, With her goodwill and doing wrong to none, Another of the Titans' offspring sat, Earth's daughter PhÅbe, and as birthday gift She gives it up to PhÅbos, PhÅbe, in the Theogonia, marries Coios, and becomes the mother of Leto, or Latona, and so the grandmother of Apollo. The âbirthday giftâ was commonly presented on the eighth day after birth, when the child was named. The oracle is spoken of as such a gift to Apollo, as bearing the name of PhÅbos. and he takes His name from PhÅbe. And he, leaving then The pool The sacred circular pool of Delos is the crater of an extinct volcano.

The words refer to the supposed origin of the Sacred Road from Athens to Delphi passing through BÅotia and Phokis. When the Athenians sent envoys to consult the oracle they were preceded by men bearing axes, in remembrance of the original pioneering work which had been done for Apollo. The first work of active civilisation was thus connected with the worship of the giver of Light and Wisdom. turning thus A rough, wild country into civilised; And when He comes, the people honour him, And Delphos too, Delphos, the hero Eponymos (name-giving) of Delphi, was honoured as the son of Poseidon. Hence the Priestess invokes the latter as one of the guardian deities of the shrine. chief pilot of this land. And him Zeus sets, his mind with skill inspired, As the fourth seer upon these sacred seats; And Loxias is his father Zeus's prophet. These Gods in prologue of my prayer I worship; Pallas Pronaia Pronaia, as having her shrine or statue in front of the temple of Apollo. next with praise is honoured; Thy Nymphs adore I too where stands the rock Korykian, The Korykian rock in Parnassos, as in Soph., Antig. v. 1128; known also as the âNymphs' cavern.â hollow, loved of birds and haunt Of Gods.

In the legend which Euripides follows, KithÃ¦ron, not Parnassos, is the scene of the death of Pentheus. He, it was said, opposed the wild or frantic worship of the Pelasgic Bacchos, concealed himself that he might behold the mysteries of the MÃ¦nads, and was torn in pieces by his mother and two others, on whose eyes the God had cast such glamour that they took him for a wild beast.

If Hellas pilgrims sends, Let them approach by lot, as is our law; For as the God guides I give oracles. At one time the Oracle had been open to questioners once in the year only, afterwards once a month. The pilgrims, after they had made their offerings, cast lots, and the doors were opened to him to whom the lot had fallen. Plutarch, Qu. GrÃ¦c., p. 292. [She passes through the door to the adytum, and after a pause returns trembling and crouching with fear, supporting herself with her hands against the walls and columns. The door remains open, and Orestes and the Erinnyes are seen in the inner sanctuary. Dread things to tell, and dread for eyes to see, Have sent me back again from Loxias' shrine, So that strength fails, nor can I nimbly move, But run with help of hands not speed of foot; A woman old and terrified is nought, A very child. Lo! Into yon recess With garlands hung I go, and there I see Upon the central stone The altar of the adytum, on the very centre, as men deemed, of the whole earth. Zeus, it was said, had sent forth two eagles at the same moment; one from the East and the other from the West, and here it was that they had met. The stone was of white marble, and the two eagles were sculptured on it. Strabo, ix. 3. a God-loathed man, Sitting as suppliant, and with hands that dripped Blood-drops, and holding sword but newly drawn, And branch of olive from the topmost growth, With amplest tufts of white wool meetly wreathed; For this I will say clearly. The priestess dwells upon the outward tokens, which shewed that the suppliant came as one whose need was specially urgent. On the ritual of supplication generally comp. Suppl. vv. 22, 348, 641, Soph. Åd. King, v. 3. Åd. Col. vv. 469â489. And a troop Of women strange to look at sleepeth there, Before this wanderer, seated on their stools; Not women they, but Gorgons Ãschylos apparently follows the Theogonia of Hesiod (1.278) who describes the Gorgons as three in number, daughters of Phorkys and Keto, and bearing the names of Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. The last enters into the Perseus cycle of myths, as one of the monsters whom he conquered, with a face once beautiful, but with her hair turned to serpents by the wrath of Athena, and so dreadful to look upon that whoso gazed on her was turned to stone. When Perseus had slain her, Athena placed her head in her Ã¦gis, and thus became the terror of all who were foes to herself or her people. A wild legendary account of them meets us in the Prom. Bound, v. 812. As works of art, the Gorgon images are traceable to the earliest or Kyclopian period. I must call them; Nor yet can I to Gorgon forms compare them: I have seen painted shapes that bear away The feast of Phineus. Here also we have a reference to a familiar subject of early Greek art, probably to some painting familiar to an Athenian audience. The name of Phineus indicates that the monstrous forms spoken of are those of the Harpies, birds with women's faces, or women with birds' wings, who were sent to vex the blind seer for his cruelty to the children of his first marriage. Comp. Soph. Antig. v. 973. In the Ãneid they appear (III. 225) as dwelling in the Strophades, and harassing Ãneas and his companions. Wingless, though, are these, And swarth, and every way abominable. They snort with breath that none may dare approach, And from their eyes a loathsome humour pours, And such their garb as neither to the shrine Of Gods is meet to bring, nor mortal roof. Ne'er have I seen a race that owns this tribe, Nor is there land that boasts it rears this brood, Unhurt and free from sorrow for its pains. Henceforth be it the lot of Loxias, Our mighty lord, himself to deal with them: A prophet-healer he, and portent-seer, And for all others cleanser of their homes. Enter Apollo from the inner adytum, attended by Hermes. Apol. [To Orestes.] Nay, I'll not fail thee, but as close at hand Will guard thee to the end, or though far off, Will not prove yielding to thine adversaries; And now thou see'st these fierce ones captive ta'en, These loathly maidens fallen fast asleep. Hoary and ancient virgins they, with whom Nor God, nor man, nor beast, holds intercourse. They owe their birth to evils; for they dwell In evil darkness, yea in Tartaros Beneath the earth, and are the hate and dread Of all mankind, and of Olympian Gods. Yet fly thou, fly, and be not faint of heart; For they will chase thee over mainland wide, As thou dost tread the soil by wanderers tracked, And o'er the ocean, and by sea-girt towns; And fail thou not before the time, as brooding O'er this great toil. But go to Pallas' city, And sit, and clasp her ancient image The old image of Pallas, carved in olive-wood, as distinguished from later sculpture. there; And there with judges of these things, and words Strong to appease, will we a means devise To free thee from these ills for evermore; For I urged thee to take thy mother's life. Orest. Thou know'st, O king Apollo, not to wrong; And since thou know'st, learn also not to slight: Thy strength to act is fully competent. Apol. Remember, let no fear o'ercome thy soul; And [To Hermes,] thou, my brother, of one father born, O Hermes, guard him; true to that thy name, Be thou his Guide, true shepherd of this man, Who comes to me as suppliant: Zeus himself Reveres this reverence e'en to outcasts due, When it to mortals comes with guidance good. The early code of hospitality bound the host, who as such had once received a guest under the shelter of his roof, not to desert him, even though he might discover afterwards that he had been guilty of great crimes, but to escort him safely to the boundary of his territory. Thus Apollo, as the host with whom Orestes had taken refuge, sends Hermes, the escort God, to guide and defend him on his way to Athens. [Exit Orestes led by Hermes. Apollo retires within the Adytum. The Ghost of ClytÃ¦mnestra rises from the ground. ClytÃ¦m. What ho! Sleep on! What need of sleepers now? And I am put by you to foul disgrace Among the other dead, nor fails reproach Among the shades that I a murderess am; And so in shame I wander, and I tell you That at their hands I bear worst form of blame. And much as I have borne from nearest kin, Yet not one God is stirred to wrath for me, Though done to death by matricidal hands. See ye these heart-wounds, whence and how they came? Yea, when it sleeps, the mind is bright with eyes; The thought that the highest wisdom came to men rather in âvisions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,â than through the waking senses, which we have already met with in Agam. v. 173, is traceable to the mysticism of Pythagoras, more distinctly perhaps to that of Epimenides. But in the day it is man's lot to lack All true discernment. Many a gift of mine Have ye lapped up, libations pure from wine, Wine, as in Soph. Åd. Col. vv. 100, 481, was rigidly excluded from the cultus of the Eumenides, and to them only as daughters of Night were midnight sacrifices offered. And soothing rites that shut out drunken mirth; And I dread banquets of the night would offer On altar-hearth, at hour no God might share. And lo! all this is trampled under foot. He is escaped, and flees, like fawn, away; And even from the midst of all your toils Has nimbly slipped, and draws wide mouth at you. Hear ye; for I have spoken for my life: Give heed, ye dark, earth-dwelling Goddesses. I, ClytÃ¦mnestra's phantom, call on you. [The Erinnyes snort and snore. Snore on, the man is gone, and flees far off: My kindred find protectors; I find none. [Snore and snort as before. Too sleep-oppressed art thou, nor pitiest me: Orestes, murderer of his mother, 'scapes. [Noises repeated. Dost snort? Dost snore? Wilt thou not rise and speed? What have ye ever done but work out ill? [Noises as before. Yea, sleep and toil, supreme conspirators, Have withered up the dreaded dragon's strength. Chor. [starting up suddenly with a yell.] Seize him, seize, seize, yea, seize: look well to it. ClytÃ¦m. Thou, phantom-like, The common rendering âin a dreamâ gives a sufficient meaning, and is, of course, tenable enough. But there is a force in the repetition of the same word, as in v. 116, which is thus lost, and which I have endeavoured to preserve. The Erinnyes, thus impotent in their rage, are as much mere dream-like spectres as is the ghost of ClytÃ¦mnestra. dost hunt thy prey, and criest, Like hound that never rests from thoughts of toil. What dost thou? (to one Erinnys.) Rise and let not toil o'ercome thee, Nor, lulled to sleep, lose all thy sense of loss. Let thy soul (to another) feel the pain of just reproach: The wise of heart find that their goad and spur. And thou (to a third), breathe on him with thy blood-flecked breath, And with thy vapour, thy maw's fire, consume him; Chase him, and wither with a fresh pursuit. Leader of the Chor. Wake, wake, I say; wake her, as I wake thee. Dost slumber? Rise, I say, and shake off sleep. Let's see if this our prelude be in vain. Stroph. I. Pah! Pah! Oh me! We suffered, O my friends. ... Yea, many mine own sufferings undeserved. ... We suffered a great sorrow, full of woe, An evil hard to bear. Out of the nets he's slipped, our prey is gone: O'ercome by sleep I have my quarry lost. Antistroph. I. Ah, son of Zeus, a very robber thou, Though young, thou did'st old Goddesses ride down, Here, as throughout Ãschylos, the Olympian divinities are thought of as new comers, thrusting from their thrones the older Chthonian and Titanic dynasty, Gods of the conquering Hellenes superseding those of the Pelasgi. Honouring thy suppliant, godless though he be, One whom his parents loathe: Thou, though a God, a matricide hast rescued: Of which of these acts can one speak as just? Stroph. II. Yea, and this shame that came to me from dreams Smote me, as charioteer Smites with a goad he in the middle grasps, Beneath my breast, my heart; 'Tis ours to feel the keen, the o'er keen smart, As by the public scourger fiercely lashed. Antistroph. II. Such are the doings of these younger Gods, Beyond all bounds of right Stretching their power. ... A clot of blood besmeared Upon the base, the head, ... Earth's central shrine itself we now may see Take to itself pollution terrible. Stroph. III. And thou, a seer, with guilt that stains thy hearth Hast fouled thy shrine, self-prompted, self-impelled, Against the laws of Gods a mortal honouring, And bringing low the Fates Born in the hoary past. Antistroph. III. Me he may vex, but shall not rescue him; Though 'neath the earth he flee, he is not freed; For he, blood-stained, shall find upon his head Another after me, Destroyer foul and dread. [Apollo advances from the Adytum and confronts them. Apol. Out, out, I bid you, quickly from this temple; Go forth, and leave this shrine oracular, Lest with a serpent winged and glistening bright, Forth darted from my bow-string golden-wrought, Thou in sore pain bring up dark foam, and vomit The clots of blood thou suck'dst from human veins. This is no house where ye may meetly come, But there where heads upon the scaffold lie, The accumulation of horrid forms of cruelty had, probably, a special significance for the Athenians. These punishments belonged to their enemies the Persians, not to the Hellenic race, and the poet's purpose was to rekindle patriotic feeling by dwelling on their barbarity, as in Agam. v. 894, he points in like manner to their haughtiness and luxury. And eyes are gouged, and throats of men are cut, And mutilation mars the bloom of youth, Where men are maimed and stoned to death, and groan With bitter wailing, on the stake impaled; Hear ye what feast ye love, and so become Loathed of the Gods? Yes, all your figure's fashion Points clearly to it. Such as ye should dwell In cave of lion battening upon blood, Nor tarry in these sacred precincts here, Working defilement. Go, and roam afield Without a shepherd, for to flock like this Not one of all the Gods is friendly found. Chor. O king Apollo, hear us in our turn: No mere accomplice art thou of these things, But guilty art in full as principal. Apol. How then? Prolong thy speech to tell me this. Chor. Thou bad'st this stranger be a matricide. Apol. I bade him to avenge his sire. Why not? Chor. Then thou did'st welcome here the blood just shed. Apol. I bade him seek this shrine as suppliant. Chor. Yet us who were his escort thou revilest. Apol. It is not meet that ye come nigh this house. Chor. Yet is this self-same task appointed us. Apol. What function's this? Take goodly grounds for boasting. Chor. We drive from home the murderers of their mothers. Apol. What? Those who kill a wife that slays her spouse? Chor. That deed brings not the guilt of blood of kin. The argument of the Erinnyes is, to some extent, like that of the Antigone of Sophocles, (Antig. 909â913,) and the wife of Intaphernes, (Herod. III. 119.) The tie which binds the husband to the wife is less sacred than that between the mother and the son. This therefore brings on the slayer the guilt of blood of kin, while murder in the other case is reduced to simple homicide. Orestes therefore was not justified in perpetrating the greater crime as a retribution for the less. Apol. Truly thou mak'st dishonoured, and as nought The marriage-vows of Zeus and Hera great; And by this reasoning Kypris too is shamed, From whom men gain the ties of closest love. For still to man and woman marriage bed, Assigned by Fate and guided by the Right, Is more than any oath. If thou then deal So gently, when the one the other slays, And dost not even look on them with wrath, I say thou dost not justly chase Orestes; For thou, in this one case, I know, dost rage; I'the other, clearly tak'st it easily: The Goddess Pallas shall our quarrel judge. Chor. That man I ne'er will leave for evermore. Apol. Chase him then, chase, and gain yet more of toil. Chor. Curtail not thou my functions by thy speech. Apol. Ne'er by my choice would I thy functions own. Chor. True: great thy name among the thrones of Zeus: But I, his mother's blood constraining me, Will this man chase and track him like a hound. Apol. And I will help him and my suppliant free; For dreadful among Gods and mortals too The suppliant's curse, should I abandon him. [Exeunt. Scene changes to Athens, in front of the Temple of Athena Polias, on the Acropolis. The ideal interval of time between the two parts of the drama is left undefined, but it would seem from vv. 274â6 to have been long enough to have allowed of many wanderings to sacred places. Orestes does not go straight from Delphi to Athens. He appears now, not as before dripping and besmeared with blood, but with hands and garments purified. Enter Orestes. Orest. [clasping the statue of the Goddess.] O Queen Athena, I at Loxias' hest Am come: do thou receive me graciously, Sin-stained though I have been: no guilt of blood Is on my soul, nor is my hand unclean, But now with stain toned down and worn away, In other homes and journeyings among men, The story of Adrastos and CrÅsos in Herod. I. 35, illustrates the gradual purification of which Orestes speaks. The penitent who has the stain of blood-guiltiness upon him comes to the king, and the king, as his host, performs the lustral rites for him. Here Orestes urges that he has been received at many homes, and gone through many such lustrations. He has been cleansed from the pollution of sin: what he now seeks is a forensic justification. O'er land and water travelling alike, Keeping great Loxias' charge oracular, I come, O Goddess, to thy shrine and statue: Here will I stay and wait the trial's issue. Enter the Erinnyes in pursuit. Chor. Lo! here are clearest traces of the man: Follow thou up that dumb informer's Sc. the scent of blood, which though no longer visible to the eyes of men, still lingers round him and is perceptible to his pursuers. hints; For as the hound pursues a wounded fawn, So by red blood and oozing gore track we. My lungs are panting with full many a toil, Wearing man's strength down. Every spot of earth Have I now searched, and o'er the sea in flight Wingless I came pursuing, swift as ship; And now full sure he's crouching somewhere here: The smell of human blood wafts joy to me. See, see again, look round ye every way, Lest he, the murderer, slip away unscathed. He, it is true, in full security, Clasping the statue of the deathless goddess, Would fain now take his trial at our hands. This may not be; a mother's blood out-poured (Pah! pah!) can never be raised up again, The life-blood shed is pourÃ¨d out and gone, But thou must give to us to suck the blood Red from thy living members; yea, from thee, May I gain meal of drink undrinkable! And, having dried thee up, I'll drag thee down Alive to bear the doom of matricide. There thou shalt see if any other man Has sinned in not revering God or guest, Or parents dear, that each receiveth there The recompense of sin that Justice claims. For Hades is a mighty arbiter Of those that dwell below, and with a mind That writes true record all man's deeds surveys. Orest. I, taught by troubles, know full many a form Of cleansing rites,âto speak, when that is meet, And when 'tis not, keep silence, and in this I by wise teacher was enjoined to speak; For the blood fails and fades from off my hands; The guilt of matricide is washed away. For when 'twas fresh, it then was all dispelled, At PhÅbos' shrine, by spells of slaughtered swine. Long would the story be, if told complete, Of all I joined in harmless intercourse. Time waxing old, too, cleanses all alike: And now with pure lips, I in words devout, Call AthenÃ¦a, whom this land owns queen, To come and help me: So without a war Shall she gain me, my land, my Argive people, Full faithful friends, allies for evermore; Here, too, we trace the political bearing of the play. In the year when it was produced (B. C. 458) an alliance with Argos was the favourite measure of the more conservative party at Athens. But whether in the climes of Libyan land, Hard by her birth-stream's foam, Tritonian named, The names Triton and Tritonis, wherever found in classical geography, (Libya, Crete, Thessaly, BÅotia,) are always connected with the legend that Athena was born there. Probably both name and legend were carried from Greece to Libya, and then amalgamated with the indigenous local worship of a warlike goddess. Hesiod (iv. 180, 188) connects the Libyan lake with the legend of Jason and the Argonauts. She stands upright, or sits with feet enwrapt, Helping her friends, or o'er PhlegrÃ¦an plains, Like a bold chieftain, she keeps watchful guard, In the war with the giants fought in the PhlegrÃ¦an plains (the volcanic district of Campania) Athena had helped her father Zeus by her wise counsel, and was honoured there as keeping in check the destructive Titanic forces which had been so subdued, burying Enkelados, e.g., in Sicily. The âfriendsâ are her Libyan worshippers. Oh, may she come! (Far off a God can hear,) And work for me deliverance from these ills! Chor. Nay, nor Apollo, nor Athena's might Can save thee from the doom of perishing, Outcast, not knowing where to look for joy, The bloodless food of demons, a mere shade. Wilt thou not answer? Scornest thou my words? A victim reared and consecrate to me, Alive thou'lt feed me, not at altar slain; And thou shalt hear our hymn as spell to bind thee. The Erinnyes, as they sing the ode that follows, move round and round in solemn and weird measure. Come, then, let us form our chorus; Since 'tis now our will to utter Melody of song most hateful, Telling how our band assigneth All the lots that fall to mortals; And we boast that we are righteous: Not on one who pure hands lifteth Falleth from us any anger, But his life he passeth scatheless; But to him who sins like this man And his blood-stained hands concealeth, Witnesses for those who perish, Coming to exact blood-forfeit, We appear to work completeness. Stroph. I. O mother who did'st bear me, mother Night, A terror of the living and the dead, Hear me, oh, hear! The son of Leto puts me to disgrace And robs me of my spoil, This crouching victim for a mother's blood: And over him as slain, We raise this chant of madness, frenzy-working, The Choral ode here is brought in as an incantation. This weapon is to succeed where others have failed, and this too, the frenzy which seizes the soul in the remembrance of its past transgression, is soothed and banished by Athena. The hymn the Erinnyes love, A spell upon the soul, a lyreless strain That withers up men's strength. Antistroph. I. This lot the all-pervading Destiny Hath spun to hold its ground for evermore, That we should still attend On him on whom there rests the guilt of blood Of kin shed causelessly, Till earth lie o'er him; nor shall death set free. And over him as slain, We raise this chant of madness, frenzy-working, The hymn the Erinnyes love, A spell upon the soul, a lyreless strain That withers up men's strength. Stroph. II. Such lot was then assigned us at our birth: From us the Undying Ones must hold aloof: Nor is there one who shares The banquet-meal with us; In garments white I have nor part nor lot; White, as the special colour of festal joy, was not used in the worship of the Erinnyes. My choice was made for overthrow of homes; Where home-bred slaughter works a loved one's death: Ha! hunting after him, Strong though he be, 'tis ours To wear the newness of the fresh blood down. Antistroph. II. Since 'tis our work another's task to take, The thought which underlies the obscurity of a corrupt passage seems to be that, as they relieve the Gods from the task of being avengers of blood, all that the Gods on their side can legitimately do against them is to render powerless the prayers for vengeance offered by the kindred of the slain. Their very isolation, as Chthonian deities, from the Gods of Olympos should protect them from open conflict. But an alternative rendering of the second line gives, perhaps, a better meaningâ âAnd by the prayers men offer unto me Work freedom for the Gods.â i.e., by being the appointed receivers of such prayers for vengeance, they leave the Gods free for a higher and serener life. The Gods indeed may bar the force of prayers Men offer unto me, But cannot clash in strife; For Zeus doth cast us from his fellowship, Blood-dropping, worthy of his utmost hate. ... For leaping down as from the topmost height, I on my victim bring The crushing force of feet, Limbs that o'erthrow e'en those that swiftly run, An AtÃ¨ hard to bear. Stroph. III. And fame of men, though very lofty now Beneath the clear, bright sky, Below the earth grows dim and fades away Before the attack of us, the black-robed ones, And these our dancings wild, Which all men loathe and hate. Antistroph. III. Falling in frenzied guilt, he knows it not; So thick the blinding cloud That o'er him floats; and Rumour widely spread With many a sigh reports the dreary doom, A mist that o'er the house In gathering darkness broods. Stroph. IV. Fixed is the law, no lack of means find we: Our purpose never fails; The dreaded Ones, the registrars of crime, Whom mortals fail to soothe, Fulfilling tasks dishonoured, unrevered, Apart from all the Gods, In foul and sunless gloom. Perhaps, âWith torch of sunless gloom.â Driving o'er rough steep road both those that see, And those whose eyes are closed. Antistroph. IV. What mortal man then doth not bow in awe And fear before all this, Hearing from me the destined ordinance Assigned me by the Gods? This task of mine is one of ancient days; Nor meet I here with scorn, Though 'neath the earth I dwell, And live there in the darkness thick and dense, Where never sunbeam falls. [Enter Athena, appearing in her chariot, and then alights. Athena. I heard far off the cry of thine entreaty E'en from Scamandros, The words contain an allusion to the dispute between Athens and Mitylene in the time of Peisistratos, as to the possession of Sigeion. Athena asserts that it had been given to her by the whole body of AchÃ¦ans at the time when they had taken TroÃ¯a. Comp. Herod. v. 94, 95. It probably entered into the political purposes of the play to excite the Athenians to a war in this direction, so as to draw them off from the constitutional changes proposed by Pericles and Ephialtes. claiming there mine own, The land which all Achaia's foremost leaders, As portion chief from out the spoils of war, Gave to me, trees and all, for evermore, A special gift for Theseus' progeny. Thence came I plying foot that never tires, Flapping my Ã¦gis-folds, no need of wings, My chariot drawn by young and vigorous colts; And seeing this new presence in the land, I have no fear, though wonder fills mine eyes; Who, pray, are ye? To all of you I speak, And to this stranger at my statue suppliant. And as for you, like none of Nature's births, Nor seen by Gods among the Goddess-forms, Nor yet in likeness of a mortal shape. ... But to speak ill of neighbours blameless found Is far from just, and Right holds back from it. Chor. Daughter of Zeus, thou shalt learn all in brief; Children are we of everlasting Night; [At home, beneath the earth, they call us Curses.] Athena. Your race I know, and whence ye take your name. Chor. Thou shalt soon know then what mine office is. Athena. Then could I know, if ye clear speech would speak. Chor. We from their home drive forth all homicides. Athena. Where doth the slayer find the goal of flight? Chor. Where to find joy in nought is still his wont. Athena. And whirrest thou such flight on this man here? Chor. Yea, for he thought it meet to slay his mother. Athena. Was there no other power whose wrath he feared? Chor. What motive, then, should prick to matricide? Athena. Two sides are here, and I but half have heard. Chor. But he nor tenders nor accepts an oath. Here, and throughout the trial, we have to bear in mind the technicalities of Athenian judicial procedure. The prosecutor, in the first instance, tendered to the accused an oath that he was not guilty. This he might accept or refuse. In the latter case, the course of the trial was at least stopped, and judgment might be recorded against him. If he could bring himself to accept it, he was acquitted of the special charge of which he was accused, but was liable to a prosecution afterwards for that perjury. If, on the other hand, he tendered an oath affirming his guilt to the prosecutor, he placed himself in his hands. Orestes, not being able to deny the fact, will not declare on oath that he is ânot guilty,â but neither will he place himself in the power of his accusers. The peculiarities of this use of oaths were: (1.) That they were taken by the parties to the suit, not by witnesses. (2.) That if both parties agreed to that mode of decision, the oath was either way decisive. An allusion to the latter practice is found in Heb. vi. 16, and traces of it are found, as the Yelverton cause celebre has recently reminded us, in the law-proceedings of Scotland. Athena. Thou lov'st the fame of Justice more than act. Chor. How so? Inform me. Skill thou dost not lack! Athena. 'Tis not by oaths a cause unjust shall win. Ãschylos seems here to attach himself to the principles of those who were seeking to reform the practice described in the previous note as being at once cumbrous and unjust, throwing its weight into the scale of the least scrupulous conscience, and to urge a simpler, more straightforward trial. The same objection is noticed by Aristotle in his discussion of the subject. (Rhet. i. 15.) Chor. Try then the cause, and righteous judgment judge. Athena. And would ye trust to me to end the cause? Athena offers herself, not as arbitrator or sovereign judge, but as presiding over the court of jurors whom she proceeds to appoint. Chor. How else? Thy worth and worthy stock we honour. Athena. What dost thou wish, O stranger, to reply? Tell thou thy land, thy race, thy life's strange chance, And then ward off this censure aimed at thee, Since thou sitt'st trusting in thy right, and hold'st This mine own image, near mine altar hearth, A suppliant, like Ixion, Ixion appeared in the mythical history of Greece as the prototype of all suppliants for purification. When he had murdered Deioneus, Zeus had had compassion to him, received him as a guest, cleansed him from his guilt. His ingratitude for this service was the special guilt of his attempted outrage upon Hera. The case is mentioned again in v. 687. honourable. Give thou an answer all may understand. Orest. O Queen Athena, from thy last words starting, I first will free thee from a weighty care: I am not now defiled: no curse abides Upon the hand that on thy statue rests; And I will give thee proof full strong of this. The law is fixed the murderer should be dumb, Till at the hand of one who frees from blood, The purple stream from yeanling swine run o'er him; In heathen, as in Jewish sacrifices, the blood was the very instrument of purification. It was sprinkled or poured upon men, and they became clean. But this could not be done by the criminal himself nor by any chance person. The service had to be rendered by a friend, who of very love gave himself to this mediatorial work. Long since at other houses these dread rites In the legend related by Pausanias (Corinth. c. 3) TrÅzen was the first place where Orestes was thus received, and in his time the descendants of those who had thus helped held periodical feasts in commemoration of it. We have gone through, slain victims, flowing streams: This care, then, I can speak of now as gone. And how my lineage stands thou soon shalt know: An Argive I, my sire well known to thee, Chief ruler of the seamen, Agamemnon, With whom thou madest TroÃ¯a, Ilion's city, To be no city. He, when he came home, Died without honour; and my dark-souled mother Enwrapt and slew him with her broidered toils, Which bore their witness of the murder wrought There in the bath; and I, on my return, (Till then an exile,) did my mother kill, (That deed I'll not deny,) in forfeit due Of blood for blood of father best beloved; And Loxias, too, is found accomplice here, Foretelling woes that pricked my heart to act, If I did nought to those accomplices In that same crime. But thou, judge thou my cause, If what I did were right or wrong, and I, Whate'er the issue, will be well content. Athena. Too great this matter, if a mortal man Think to decide it. Nor is't meet for me To judge a cause of murder stirred by wrath; And all the more since thou with contrite soul Hast come to this my house a suppliant, Harmless and pure. I now, in spite of all, Take thee as one my city need not blame; The course which Athena takes is: (1,) to receive Orestes as a settler with the rights which attached to such persons on Athenian soil, not a criminal fugitive to be simply surrendered; (2,) to offer to the Erinnyes, as being too important to be put out of court, a fair and open trial; (3,) to acknowledge that he and they are equally âblameless,â as far as she is concerned. She has no complaint to make of them. But these hold office that forbids dismissal, And should they fail of victory in this cause, Hereafter from their passionate mood will poison The red blight of vines and wheat was looked on as caused by drops of blood which the Erinnyes had let fall. Fall on the land, disease intolerable, And lasting for all time. E'en thus it stands; And both alike, their staying or their dismissal, Are unto me perplexing and disastrous. But since the matter thus hath come on me, I will appoint as judges of this murder Men bound by oath, a law for evermore; Stress is laid on the fact that the judges of the Areopagos, in contrast with those of the inferior tribunes of Athens, discharged their duty under the sanction of an oath. And ye, call ye your proofs and witnesses, Sworn pledges given to help the cause of right. And I, selecting of my citizens Those who are best, will come again that they May judge this matter truly, taking oaths To utter nought against the law of right. [Exit. Chor. Stroph. I. Now will there be an outbreak of new laws: If victory shall rest Upon the wrong right of this matricide, This deed will prompt forthwith All mortal men to callous recklessness. And many deaths, I trow, At children's hands their parents now await Through all the time to come. Antistroph. I. For since no wrath on evil deeds will creep Henceforth from those who watch With wild, fierce soul the evil deeds of men, I will let loose all crime; And each from each shall seek in eager quest, Speaking of neighbours' ills, For pause and lull of woes; Perhaps âAnd each from each shall learn, as he predicts His neighbour's ills, that he Shares in the same and harbours them, and speaks, Poor wretch, of cures that fail.â yet wretched man, He speaks of cures that fail. Stroph. II. Henceforth let none invoke us, When smitten by mischance, Uttering this cry of prayer, âO Justice, and O ye, Erinnyes' thrones!â Such wail, perchance, a father then shall utter, Or mother newly slain, Since, fallen low, the house of Justice now Lies prostrate in the dust. Antistroph. II. There are with whom 'tis well That awe should still abide, As watchman o'er their souls; Calm wisdom gained by sorrow profits much: For who that in the gladness of his heart, Or man or commonwealth, Has nought of this, would bow at Justice' throne Humbly as heretofore? At a more advanced period of human thought, Cicero (Orat. pro Roscio, c. 24) could point to the âthoughts that accuse each other,â the honour and remorse of the criminal, as the true Erinnyes, the âassiduÃ¦ domesticÃ¦que FuriÃ¦.â Ãschylos clings to the mythical symbolism as indispensable for the preservation of the truth which it shadowed forth. Stroph. III. Praise not the lawless life, Nor that which owns a despot's sovereignty; To the true mean in all God gives success, Once again we have the poet of constitutional conservatism keeping the via media between Peisistratos and Pericles. And looks on other things With glance of other mood; And I will say with this in harmony, That Pride is truly child of Godlessness; While from the soul's true health Comes the fair fortune, loved of all mankind, And aim of many a prayer. Antistroph. III. And now, I say, in sum, Revere the altar reared to Justice high, Nor, thine eye set on gain, with godless foot Treat it contemptuously: For penalty shall come, The destined end abideth still for each. Therefore let each be found full honour giving To parents, and to those, The honoured guests that gather in his house. Let him due reverence show. Stroph. IV. And one who of his own free will is just, Not by enforced constraint, He shall not be unblest, Nor can he e'er be utterly o'erthrown; But he that dareth, and transgresseth all, In wild, confusÃ¨d deeds, Where Justice is not seen, I say that he perforce, as time wears on, Will have to take in sail, When trouble makes him hers, and each yard-arm Is shivered by the blast. Antistroph. IV. And then he calls on those who hear him not, And struggles all in vain, In the fierce waves' mid-whirl; And God still mocks the man with hot thoughts stirred, When he sees him who bragged it ne'er would come, With woes inextricable Worn out, and failing still To weather round the perilous promontory; And for all time to come, Wrecking his once high bliss on Justice' reefs, He dies unwept, unseen. [The scene changes to the Areopagos. Enter Athena, followed by Herald and twelve Athenian citizens. Athena. Cry out, O herald; the great host hold back; Then let Tyrrhenian trumpet, The Tyrrhenian trumpet, with its bent and twisted tube, retained its proverbial pre-eminence from the days of Ãschylos and Sophocles, (Aias, 17) to those of Virgil, (Ãn. viii. 526.) piercing heaven, Filled with man's breath, to all that host send forth The full-toned notes, (for while this council-hall Is filling, it is meet men hold their peace.) [Herald blows his trumpet. And let the city for all time to come Learn these my laws, and this accused one too, That so the trial may be rightly judged. The fondness of the Athenians for litigation, and the large share which every citizen took in the administration of justice, would probably make the scene which follows, with all its technicalities, the part of the play into which they would most enter. [As Athena speaks, Apollo enters. Chor. O King Apollo, rule thou o'er thine own; But what hast thou to do with this our cause? Apol. I am come both as witness,âfor this man Is here as suppliant, seated on my hearth, And I his cleanser am from guilt of blood,â And to plead for him as his advocate: I bear the blame of that his mother's death. But thou, whoe'er dost act as president, Open the suit in way well known to thee. It was necessary that some one, sitting as President of the Court, should formally open the pleadings, by calling on this side or that to begin. Here Athena takes that office on herself, and calls on the Erinnyes. Athena. [To the Erinnyes.] 'Tis yours to speak; I thus the pleadings open, For so the accuser, speaking first, would have, Of right, the task to state the cause at issue. Chor. Many are we, but briefly will we speak; And answer thou, in thy turn, word for word; First tell us this, did'st thou thy mother slay? Orest. I slew her: of that fact is no denial. Chor. Here, then, is one of our three bouts The technicalities of the Areopagos are still kept up. The three points on which the Erinnyes, as prosecutors, lay stress are: (1,) the fact of the murder; (2,) the mode; (3,) the motive. âThree bouts,â as referring to the rule of the arena, that three struggles for the mastery should be decisive. decided. Orest. Thou boastest this o'er one not yet thrown down. Chor. This thou at least must tell, how thou did'st slay her. Orest. E'en so; I cut her throat with hand sword-armed. Chor. By whom persuaded, and with whose advice? Orest. [Pointing to Apollo.] By His divine command: He bears me witness. Chor. The prophet-God prompt thee to matricide! Orest. Yea, and till now I do not blame my lot. Chor. Nay, when found guilty, soon thou'lt change thy tone. Orest. I trust: my sire will send help from the tomb. Chor. Trust in the dead, thou murderer of thy mother! Orest. Yes; for in her two great pollutions met. Chor. How so, I pray? Inform the court of this? Orest. She both her husband and my father slew. Chor. Nay then, thou liv'st, and she gets quit by death. Orest. Why, while she lived, did'st thou to chase her fail? Chor. The man she slew was not of one blood with her. The pleas put in by the Erinnyes as prosecutors are: (1,) That ClytÃ¦mnestra had been adequately punished by her death, while Orestes was still alive; and (2,) when asked why they had not intervened to bring about that punishment, that the relationship between husband and wife was less close than that between mother and son. They drew, in other words, a distinction between consanguinity and affinity, and upon this the rest of the discussion turns. Orestes, and Apollo as his counsel, on the other hand, meet this with the rejoinder, that there is no blood-relationship between the mother and her offspring. Orest. And does my mother's blood then flow in me? Chor. E'en so; how else, O murderer, reared she thee Within her womb? Disown'st thou mother's blood? Orest. [Turning to Apollo.] Now bear thou witness, and declare to me, Apollo, if I slew her righteously; For I the deed as fact will not deny. But whether right or wrong this deed of blood Seem in thine eyes, judge thou that these may hear. Apol. I will to you, Athena's solemn council, Speak truly, and as prophet will not lie. Ne'er have I spoken on prophetic throne, Of man, or woman, or of commonwealth, But as great Zeus, Olympian Father, bade; And that ye learn how much this plea avails, I bid you [Turning to the court of jurymen] follow out my Father's will; No oath can be of greater might than Zeus. Sc., Their oath to give a verdict according to the evidence must yield to the higher obligation of following the Divine will rather than the letter of the law. Chor. Zeus, then, thou say'st, did prompt the oracle That this Orestes here, his father's blood Avenging, should his mother's rights o'erthrow? Apol. 'Tis a quite other thing for hero-chief, Bearing the honour of Zeus-given sceptre, To die, and at a woman's hands, not e'en By swift, strong dart, as from Amazon's bow, To have died in health by the arrows of a woman-warrior might have been borne. To be slain by a wife treacherously in his bath was to endure a far worse outrage. But as thou, Pallas, now shalt hear, and those Who sit to give their judgment in this cause; For when he came successful from the trade Of war with largest gains, receiving him With kindly words of praise, she spread a robe Over the bath, yes, even o'er its edge, As he was bathing, and entangling him In endless folds of cloak of cunning work, She strikes her lord down. Thus the tale is told Of her lord's murder, chief whom all did honour, The ship's great captain. So I tell it out, E'en as it was, to thrill the people's hearts, Who now are set to give their verdict here. Chor. Zeus then a father's death, as thou dost say, Of highest moment holds, yet He himself Bound fast in chains his aged father, Cronos; In this new argument, and the answer to it, we may trace, as in the Prometheus and the Agamemnon, the struggles of the questioning intellect against the more startling elements of the popular religious belief. Zeus is worshipped as the supreme Lord, yet His dominion seems founded on might as opposed to goodness, on the unrighteous expulsion of another. Here, in Apollo's answer, there is the glimmer of a possible reconciliation. The old and the new, the sovereignty of Cronos and that of Zeus may be reconciled, and one supreme God be âall in all.â Are not thy words at variance with the facts? I call on you [To the Court] to witness what he says. Apol. O hateful creatures, loathÃ¨d of the Gods, Those chains may be undone, that wrong be cured, And many a means of rescue may be found: But when the dust has drunk the blood of men, No resurrection comes for one that's dead: No charm for these things hath my sire devised; But all things else he turneth up or down, And orders without toil or weariness. Comp. the thought and language of the Suppliants, v. 93. Chor. Take heed how thou help this man to escape: Shall he who stained earth with his mother's blood Then dwell in Argos in his father's house? What public altars can he visit now? What lustral rite of clan or tribe admit him? The last argument is, that the acquittal can be, at the best, partial only, not complete; formal, not real. There would remain for ever the pollution which would exclude Orestes from the Phratria, the clan-brotherhood, by which, as by a sacramental bond, all the members were held together. Apol. This too I'll say; judge thou if I speak right: The mother is not parent of the child That is called hers, but nurse of embryo sown. He that begets is parent: The question seems to have been one of those which occupied men's minds in their first gropings towards the mysteries of man's physical life, and both popular metaphors and primary impressions were in favour of the hypothesis here maintained. Euripides (Orest. v. 534) puts the same argument into the mouth of Orestes. she, as stranger, For stranger rears the scion, if God mar not; And of this fact I'll give thee proof full sure. A father there may be without a mother: Here nigh at hand, as witness, is the child Of high Olympian Zeus, for she not e'en Was nurtured in the darkness of the womb, The story of Athena's birth, full-grown, from the head of Zeus, is next referred to as the leading case bearing on the point at issue. Yet such a scion may no God beget. I both in all else, Pallas, as I know, Will make thy city and thy people great, And now this man have sent as suppliant Upon thy hearth, that he may faithful prove Now and for ever, and that thou, O Goddess, May'st gain him as ally, and all his race, And that it last as law for evermore, That these men's progeny our treaties own. Athena. [To jurors.] I bid you give, according to your conscience, A verdict just; enough has now been said. Chor. We have shot forth our every weapon now: I wait to hear what way the strife is judged. Athena. [To Chorus.] How shall I order this, unblamed by you? Chor. [To jurors.] Ye heard what things ye heard, and in your hearts Reverence your oaths, and give your votes, O friends. Athena. Hear ye my order, O ye Attic people, In act to judge your first great murder-cause. And henceforth shall the host of Ãgeus' race Here, of course, the political interest of the whole drama reached its highest point. What seems comparatively flat to us must, to the thousands who sat as spectators, have been fraught with the most intense excitement, showing itself in shouts of applause, or audible tokens of clamorous dissent. The rivalry of Whigs and Tories over Addison's Cato, the sensation produced in times of Papal aggression by the king's answer to Pandulph in King John, present analogies which are worth remembering. For ever own this council-hall of judges: And for this Ares' hill, the Amazons' seat And camp when they, enraged with Theseus, came The story ran that the tribe of women-warriors from the Caucasos, or the Thermodon, known by this name, had invaded Attica under Oreithyia, when Theseus was king, to revenge the wrongs he had done them, and to recover her sister Hippolyta. Ares, the God of Thrakians, Skythians, and nearly all the wilder barbaric tribes, was their special deity; and when they occupied the hill which rose over against the Acropolis, they sacrificed to him, and so it gained the name of the Areopagos, or âhill of Ares.â In hostile march, and built as counterwork This citadel high-reared, a city new, And sacrificed to Ares, whence 'tis named As Ares' hill and fortress: in this, I say, The reverent awe its citizens shall own, And fear, awe's kindred, shall restrain from wrong By day, nor less by night, so long as those Who dwell as burghers alter not their laws: But if with stream defiled and tainted soil Clear river thou pollute, no drink thou'lt find. As in the Agamemnon, (v. 1010,) so here we find the aristocratic, conservative poet showing his colours, protesting against the admission to the Archonship, and therefore to the Areopagos, of men of low birth or in undignified employments. I give my counsel to you, citizens, To reverence and guard well that form of state Which is nor lawless, nor tyrannical, And not to cast all fear from out the city; The words, like all political clap-trap, are somewhat vague; but, as understood at the time, the âlawlessâ policy alluded to was that of Pericles and Ephialtes, who sought to deface and to diminish the jurisdiction of the Areopagos, and the âtyrannical,â that which had crushed the independence of Athens under Peisistratos. Between the two was the conservative party, of which Kimon was the leader. For what man lives devoid of fear and just? But rightly shrinking, owning awe like this, Ye then would have a bulwark of your land, A safeguard for your city, such as none Can boast in Skythia's The Skythians may be named simply as representing all barbarous, non-Hellenic races; but they appear, about this time, wild and nomadic as their life was, to have impressed the minds of the Greeks somewhat in the same way as the Germans did the minds of the Romans in the time of Tacitus. Tales floated from travellers' lips of their wisdom and their happinessâof sages like Zamolxis and Aristarchos, who rivalled those of Hellasâof the Hyperborei, in the far north, who enjoyed a perpetual and unequalled blessedness.âComp. Libation Pourers, v. 366. or in Pelops' clime. This council I establish pure from bribe, Reverend, and keen to act, for those that sleep Two topics of praise are briefly touched on: (1,) the lower, popular courts of justice at Athens might be open to the suspicion of corruption, but no breath of slander had ever tainted the fame of the Areopagos; (2,) it met by night, keeping its watch, that the citizens might sleep in peace. An ever-watchful sentry of the land. This charge of mine I thus have lengthened out For you, my people, for all time to come. And now 'tis meet ye rise, and take your ballots, The first of the twelve jurymen rises and drops his voting-ballot into one of the urns, and is followed by another at the end of each of the short two-line speeches in the dialogue that follows. The two urns of acquittal and condemnation stand in front of them. The plan of voting with different coloured balls (black and white) in the same urn, was a later usage. And so decide the cause, maintaining still Your reverence for your oath. My speech is said. Chor. And I advise you not to treat with scorn A troop that can sit heavy on your land. Apol. And I do bid you dread my oracles, And those of Zeus, nor rob them of their fruit. Chor. Uncalled thou com'st to take a murderer's part; No longer pure the oracles thou'lt speak. Apol. And did my father then in purpose err, When the first murderer he received, Ixion? Compare note on v. 419. Chor. Thou talk'st; but should I fail in this my cause, I will again dwell here and vex this land. Apol. Alike among the new Gods and the old Art thou dishonoured: I shall win the day. Chor. This did'st thou also in the house of Pheres, In the legend of Admetos son of Pheres, and king of PherÃ¦ in Thessalia, Apollo is represented as having first given wine to the Destinies, and then persuaded them to allow Admetos, whenever the hour of death should come, to be redeemed from Hades, if father, or mother, or wife were willing to die for him. The self-surrender of his wife, Alkestis, for this purpose, forms the subject of the noblest of the tragedies of Euripides. Winning the Fates to make a man immortal. Apol. Is it not just a worshipper to bless In any case,âthen most, when he's in want? Chor. Thou hast o'erthrown, yea, thou, laws hoar with age, And drugged with wine the ancient Goddesses. Partly as setting at nought the power of the Erinnyes and the Destinies, partly as giving wine to those whose libations were wineless.âComp. Sophocles Åd. Col. v. 100. Apol. Nay, thou, non-suited in this cause of thine, Shalt venom spit that nothing hurts thy foes. Chor. Since thou, though young, dost ride me down, though old, I wait to hear the issue of the cause, Still wavering in my wrath against this city. Athena. 'Tis now my task to close proceedings here; And this my vote I to Orestes add; For I no mother own that brought me forth, And in all else but wedlock I prefer The male with all my heart, and make mine own The father's cause, nor will above it place A woman's death, who slew her own true lord, The guardian of her house. Orestes wins, E'en though the votes be equal. Cast ye forth With all your speed the lots from out the urns, Ye who the juror's office own as yours. Orest. PhÅbos Apollo! what will be the judgment? Chor. Dark Night, my mother! dost thou look on this? Orest. My goal is now the noose, or full, clear sunshine. Chor. Ours too to fail, or carry on our work. [A pause. The jurors take out the voting tablets from the two urns (one of bronze, the other of wood) for acquittal or condemnation. Apol. Now count ye up the votes thrown out, O friends, And be ye honest, as ye reckon them; One sentence lacking, sorrow great may come, And one vote given hath ofttimes saved a house. [A pause, during which the urns are emptied and the votes are counted. Athena. The accused is found ânot guiltyâ of the murder: For lo! the numbers of the votes are equal. The practice of the Areopagos is accurately reproduced. When the votes of the judges were equal a casting vote was given in favour of the accused, and was known as that of Athena. Orest. O Pallas, thou who hast redeemed my house, Thou, thou hast brought me back when I had been Bereaved of fatherland, and Hellenes now Will say, âThis man's an Argive once again, And dwells upon his father's heritage, Because of Pallas and of Loxias, And Zeus, the true third Saviour, all o'erruling, Who, touched with pity for my father's fate, Saves me, beholding these my mother's pleaders.â And I will now wend homeward giving pledge To this thy country and its valiant host, To stand as firm for henceforth and for ever, That no man henceforth, chief of Argive land, Shall bring against it spearmen well equipped: For we ourselves, though in our sepulchres, On those who shall transgress these oaths of ours, Will with inextricable evils work, Making their paths disheartening, and their ways Ill-omened, that they may their toil repent. But if these oaths be kept, to those who honour This city of great Pallas, our ally, Then we to them are more propitious yet. Farewell then, Thou, and these thy citizens! May'st thou so wrestle that thy foes escape not, And so win victory and deliverance! Chor. Stroph. Ah! ah! ye younger Gods! Ye have ridden down the laws of ancient days, And robbed me of my prey. And I, dishonoured, wretched, full of wrath, Upon this land, ha! ha! Will venom, venom from my heart let fall, In vengeance for my grief, A dropping which shall smite The earth with barrenness; And thence shall come (O Vengeance!) on the plain Down swooping, blight of leaves and murrain dire. That o'er the land flings taint of pestilence; Shall I then wail and groan? Or what else shall I do? Shall I become a woe intolerable Unto this state for wrongs I have endured? Great, very great are they, Ye virgin daughters of dim Night, ill-doomed, Born both to shame and woe! Athena. Nay, list to me, and be not over-grieved Ye have not been defeated, but the cause Came fairly to a tie, no shame to thee. But the clear evidence of Zeus was given, And He who spake it bare his witness too That, doing this, Orestes should not suffer. Hurl ye not then fierce rage on this my land; Nor be ye wroth, nor work ye barrenness, By letting fall the drops of evil Powers, The baleful influence that consumes all seed. For lo! I promise, promise faithfully, That, seated on your hearths with shining thrones, Ye shall find cavern homes in righteous land, Honoured and worshipped by these citizens. Chor. Antistroph. Ah! ah! ye younger Gods! Ye have ridden down the laws of ancient days, And robbed me of my prey. And I, dishonoured, wretched, full of wrath, Upon this land, ha! ha! Will venom, venom from my heart let fall, In vengeance for my grief, A dropping which shall smite The earth with barrenness! And thence shall come, (O Vengeance!) on the plain Down-swooping, blight of leaves and murrain dire, That o'er the land flings taint of pestilence. Shall I then wail and groan? Or what else shall I do? Shall I become a woe intolerable Unto this state for wrongs I have endured? Great, very great are they, Ye virgin daughters of dim Night, ill-doomed, Born both to shame and woe! Athena. Ye are not left unhonoured; be not hot In wrath, ye Goddesses, to mar man's land. I too, yes I, trust Zeus. Need I say more? I only of the high Gods know the keys Of chambers where the sealed-up thunder lies; But that I have no need of. List to me, Nor cast upon the earth thy rash tongue's fruit, That brings to all things failure and distress; Lull thou the bitter storm of that dark surge, As dwelling with me, honoured and revered; And thou with first-fruits of this wide champaign, Offerings for children's birth and wedlock-rites, Shalt praise these words of mine for evermore. Chor. That I should suffer this, fie on it! fie! That I, with thoughts of hoar antiquity, Should now in this land dwell, Dishonoured, deemed a plague! I pant with rage, and every form of wrath. Pah! pah! fie on it! pah! What pang is this that thrills through all my breast? Hear thou, O mother Night, Hear thou my vehement wrath! For lo! deceits that none can wrestle with Have thrust me out from honours old of Gods, And made a thing of nought. Athena. Thy wrath I'll bear, for thou the elder art, [And wiser too in that respect than I;] Yet to me too Zeus gave no wisdom poor; And ye, if ye an alien country seek, Shall faint with love for this land. This I tell you; For to this people Time, as it runs on, Shall come with fuller honours, and if thou Hast honoured seat hard by Erechtheus' home, Thou shalt from men and women reap such gifts As thou would'st never gain from other mortals; But in these fields of mine be slow to cast Whetstones of murder's knife, to young hearts bale, Stirring to maddened frenzy, not of wine; Nor, as transplanting hearts of fighting-cocks, Cock-fighting took its place among the recognised sports of the Athenians. Once a year there was a public performance in the theatre. Make Ares inmate with my citizens, In civil discord, with intestine broils; Let them have war without, not scantily, For him who feels the passionate thirst of fame: Battle of home-bred birds be far from them; This it is thine to choose as gift from me; Well-doing, well-entreated, and well-honoured, To have thy share in this God-favoured land. Chor. That I should suffer this, fie on it! fie! That I, with thoughts of hoar antiquity, Should now in this land dwell, Dishonoured, deemed a plague, I pant with every rage, and every form of wrath; Pah! pah! fie on it! fie! What pang is this that thrills through all my breast? Hear thou, O mother Night, Hear thou my vehement wrath! For lo! deceits that none can wrestle with Have thrust me out from honours old of Gods, And made a thing of nought. Athena. I will not weary, telling thee of good, That thou may'st never say that thou, being old, Wert at the hands of me, a younger Goddess, And those of men who in my city dwell, Driven in dishonour, exiled from this plain. But if the might of Suasion thou count holy, And my tongue's blandishments have power to soothe, Thou then wilt stay; but if thou wilt not stay, Not justly would'st thou bring upon this city, Or wrath, or grudge, or mischief for its host. It rests with thee, as dweller in this spot, The Temple of the Eumenides or SemnÃ¦ (âvenerable onesâ) stood near the Areopagos. To meet with all due honour evermore. Chor. Athena, Queen, what seat assign'st thou me? Athena. One void of touch of evil; take thou it. Chor. Say I accept. What honour then is mine? Athena. That no one house apart from thee shall prosper. Chor. And wilt thou work that I such might may have? Athena. His lot who worships thee we'll guide aright. Chor. And wilt thou give thy warrant for all time? Athena. What I work not I might refrain from speaking. Chor. It seems thou sooth'st me: I relax my wrath. Athena. New friends then thou shalt in this country gain. Chor. What hymn then for this land dost bid me raise? Athena. Such as is meet for no ill victory. Some two or three lines have probably been lost here. And pray that blessings upon men be sent, And that, too, both from earth, and ocean's spray, And out of heaven; and that the breezy winds, In sunshine blowing, sweep upon the land, And that o'erflowing fruit of field and flock May never fail my citizens to bless, Nor safe deliverance for the seed of men. But for the godless, rather root them out: For I like gardener shepherding his plants, Accept this race of just men freed from ill; So much for thee; and I will never fail To give this city honour among men, Victorious in the noble games of war. Chor. Stroph. I. I will accept this offered home with Pallas, Nor will the city scorn, Which e'en All-ruling Zeus And Ares give as fortress of the Gods, The altar-guarding pride of Gods of Hellas; And I upon her call, With kindly auguries, That so the glorious splendour of the sun May cause life's fairest portion in thick growth To burgeon from the earth. Athena. Yes, this I work with kindliest feeling For these my subjects, having settled Great Powers and hard to soothe among them: For unto them the lot is given, All things human still to order; And he who hath not felt pain's pressure Knows not whence life's scourges smite him: For the sin of generations Past and gone;âa dumb destroyer,â Leads him on into their presence, And with mood of foe low bringeth Him whose lips are speaking proudly. Antistroph. I. Chor. Let no tree-blighting canker breathe on them, (I tell of boon I give,) Nor blaze of scorching heat, That mars the budding eyes of nursling plants, And checks their spreading o'er their narrow bounds; And may no dark, drear plague Smite it with barrenness. But may Earth feed fair flock in season due, Blest with twin births, and earth's rich produce pay To the high heavenly Powers Its gift for treasure found. Probably an allusion to the silver-mines at Laureion, which about this time formed a large element of the revenues of Athens. Athena. Hear ye then, ye city's guardians, What she offers? Dread and mighty With the Undying is Erinnys; And with Those beneath the earth too, And full clearly and completely Work they all things out for mortals, Giving these the songs of gladness, Those a life bedimmed with weeping. Stroph. II. Chor. Avaunt all evil chance That brings men low in death before their time! And for the maidens lovely and beloved, Give, ye whose work it is, Life with a husband true, And ye, O Powers of self-same mother born, Ye Fates who rule aright, Partners in every house, Awe-striking through all time, With presence full of righteousness and truth, Throughout the universe Most honoured of the Gods! Athena. Much I joy that thus ye promise These boons to my land in kindness And I love the glance of Suasion, That she guides my speech and accent Unto those who gainsaid stoutly. But the victory is won by Zeus, the agora's protector; And our rivalry in blessings Is the conqueror evermore. Antistroph. II. [Chor.] For this too I will pray, That Discord, never satiate with ill, May never ravine in this commonwealth, Nor dust that drinks dark blood From veins of citizens, Through eager thirst for vengeance, snatch at woes That came as penalties For deeds of murderous guilt. But may they give instead With friendly purpose acts of kind intent, And if need be, to hate With minds of one accord; For this is healing found to mortal men Of many a grievous woe. Athena. Are not they then waxing wiser, And at last the path discerning Of a speech more good and gentle? Now from these strange forms and fearful. See I to my townsmen coming, E'en to those, great mood of profit; For if ye, with kindly welcome, Honour these as kind protectors, Then shall ye be famed as keeping, Just and upright in all dealings, Land and city evermore. Stroph. III. Chor. Rejoice, rejoice ye in abounding wealth, Rejoice, ye citizens, Dwelling near Zeus himself, Reference is made to another local sanctuary, the temple on the Areopagos dedicated to the Olympian Zeus. Loved of the virgin Goddess whom ye love, In due time wise of heart, You, 'neath the wings of Pallas ever staying, The figure of Athena, as identical with Victory, and so the tutelary Goddess of Athens, was sculptured with outspread wings. The Father honoureth. Athena. Rejoice ye also, but before you I must march to show your chambers, By your escorts' torches holy; Go, and with those dread oblations Passing to the crypt cavernous, Keep all harm from this our country, Send all gain upon our city, Cause it o'er its foes to triumph. Lead ye on, ye sons of Cranaos, Cranaos, the son of Kecrops, the mythical founder of Athens. Lead, ye dwellers in the city, Those who come to sojourn with you, And may good gifts work good feeling In its people evermore! Antistroph. III. Chor. Rejoice, rejoice once more, ye habitants! I say it yet again, Ye Gods, and mortals too, Who dwell in Pallas' city. Should ye treat With reverence us who dwell As sojourners among you, ye shall find No cause to blame your lot. Athena. I praise these words of yours, the prayers ye offer, And with the light of torches flashing fire, Will I escort you to your dark abode, The sanctuaries of the Eumenides were crypt-like chapels, where they were worshipped in gloom by the light of lamps or torches. Low down beneath the earth, with my attendants, Who with due honour guard my statue here, For now may issue forth the goodly eye Of all the land of Theseus; fair-famed troop Of girls and women, band of matrons too, In upper vestments purple-dyed arrayed: Now then advance ye; and the blaze of fire, Let it go forth, that so this company Stand forth propitious henceforth and for aye In rearing race of noblest citizens. Enter an array of women, young and old, in procession, leading the Erinnyes,ânow, as propitiated, the Eumenides or Gentle Ones,âto their shrines. Stroph. I. Go to your home, ye great and jealous Ones, Children of Night, and yet no children ye; Perhaps, âChildren of Night, yourselves all childless left.â With escort of good will, Shout, shout, ye townsmen, shout. Antistroph. I. There in the dark and gloomy caves of earth, With worthy gifts and many a sacrifice ConsumÃ¨d in the fireâ Shout, shout ye, one and all. Stroph. II. Come, come, with thought benign, Propitious to our land, Ye dreaded Ones, yea, come, While on your progress onward ye rejoice, In the bright light of fire-devourÃ¨d torch; Shout, shout ye to our songs. Antistroph. II. Let the drink-offerings come, In order meet behind, While torches fling their light; Zeus the All-seeing thus hath joined in league With Destiny for Pallas' citizens; Shout, shout ye to our songs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX OF RHYMED CHORUSES. Verses 297â374.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Come then, and let us dance in solemn strain; It is our will to chant our harsh refrain, And tell how this our band Works among men the tasks we take in hand. In righteous vengeance find we full delight; On him who putteth forth clean hands and pure No wrath from us doth light; Unhurt shall he through all his life endure; But whoso, as this man, hath evil wrought, And hides hands stained with blood, On him we come, with power prevailing fraught, True witnesses and good, For those whom he has slain, and bent to win Full forfeit-price for that his deed of sin. Stroph. I. O Mother, Mother Night! Who did'st bear me a penalty and curse To those who see and those who see not light, Hear thou; for Leto's son, in mood perverse, Puts me to foulest shame, In that he robs me of my trembling prey, The victim whom we claim, That we his mother's blood may wash away; And over him as slain Sing we this dolorous, frenzied, maddening strain, The song that we the Erinnyes love so well, That binds the soul as with enchanter's spell, Without one note from out the sweet-voiced lyre, Withering the strength of men as with a blast of fire. Antistroph. I. For this our task hath Fate Spun without fail to last for ever sure, That we on man weighed down with deeds of hate Should follow till the earth his life immure. Nor when he dies can he Boast of being truly free; And over him as slain Sing we this dolorous, frenzied, maddening strain, The song that we the Erinnyes love so well, That binds the soul as with enchanter's spell, Without one note from out the sweet-voiced lyre, Withering the strength of men as with a blast of fire. Stroph. II. Yea, at our birth this lot to us was given, And from the immortal Ones who dwell in Heaven We still must hold aloof; None sits with us at banquets of delight, Or shares a common roof, Nor part nor lot have I in garments white; My choice was made a race to overthrow, When murder, home-reared, lays a loved one low; Strong though he be, upon his track we tread, And drain his blood till all his strength is fled. Antistroph. II. Yea, 'tis our work to set another free From tasks like this, and by my service due To give the Gods their perfect liberty, Relieved from task of meting judgment true; For this our tribe from out his fellowship Zeus hath cast out as worthy of all hate, And from our limbs the purple blood-drops drip; So with a mighty leap and grievous weight My foot I bring upon my quivering prey, With power to make the swift and strong give way, An evil and intolerable fate. Stroph. III. And all the glory and the pride of men, Though high exalted in the light of day; Wither and fade away, Of little honour then, When in the darkness of the grave they stay, By our attack brought low, The loathÃ¨d dance through which in raiment black we go: Antistroph. III. And through the ill that leaves him dazed and blind, He still is all unconscious that he falls, So thick a cloud enthrals The vision of his mind: And Rumour with a voice of wailing calls, And tells of gathering gloom That doth the ancient halls in darkness thick entomb. Stroph. IV. So it abideth still; Ready and prompt are we to work our will, The dreaded Ones who bring The dire remembrance of each deed of ill, Whom mortals may not soothe with offering, Working a task with little honour fraught, Yea, all dishonoured, task the Gods detest, In sunless midnight wrought, By which alike are pressed Those who yet live, and those who lie in gloom unblest. Antistroph. IV. What mortal man then will not crouch in fear, As he my work shall hear, The task to me by destiny from Heaven As from the high Gods given? Yea, a time-honoured lot is mine I trow, No shame in it I see, Though deep beneath the earth my station be, In gloom that never feels the sunlight's quickening glow Verses 468â535.These numerals refer to the Greek text, not to the translation Stroph. I. Now is there utter fall and overthrow, Which new-made laws begin; If he who struck the matricidal blow, His right,ânot so, his utter wrong shall win, This baseness will the minds of all men lead To wanton, reckless thought, And now for parents waits there woe, and deed Of parricidal guilt by children wrought. Antistroph. I. For then no more shall wrath from this our band, The MÃ¦nad troop that watch the deeds of men, Come for these crimes; but lo! on either hand I will let slip all evil fate, and then Telling his neighbours' grief, Shall this man seek from that, and seek in vain, Remission and relief, Nor is there any certain cure for pain. And lo! the wretched man all fruitlessly For grace and help shall cry. Stroph. II. Henceforth let no man in his anguish call, When he sore-smitten by ill-chance shall fall, Uttering with groan and moan, âO mighty Justice, O Erinnyes' throne!â So may a father or a mother wail, Struck by new woe, and tell their sorrow's tale; For low on earth doth lie The home where Justice once her dwelling had on high. Antistroph. II. Yes, there are times when reverent Awe should stay As guardian of the soul; It profits much to learn through suffering The bliss of self-control. Who that within the heart's full daylight bears No touch of holy awe, Be it or man or State that casts out fear, Will still own reverence for the might of law? Stroph. III. Nor life that will no sovran rule obey, Nor one down-crushed beneath a despot's sway, Shalt thou approve; God still gives power and strength for victory To all that in the golden mean doth lie. All else, as they in diverse order move, He scans with watchful eye. With this I speak a word in harmony, That of irreverence still Outrage is offspring ill, While from the soul's true health Comes the much-loved, much-prayed-for joy and wealth. Antistroph. III. Yes, this I bid thee know; Bow thou before the altar of the Right, And let no wandering glance That looks at gain askance Lead thee with godless foot to scorn or slight. Know well the appointed penalty shall come; The doom remaineth sure and will at last strike home. Wherefore let each man pay the reverence due To those who call him son; By each to thronging guests let honour true In loyal faith be done. Stroph. IV. But one who with no pressure of constraint Of his free will draws back from evil taint, He shall not be unblest, Nor ever sink by utter woe oppressed. But this I still aver, That he whose daring leads him to transgress, The chaos wild of evil deeds to stir, In sharp and sore distress, Against his will will slacken sail ere long, When, as his timbers crash before the blast, He feels the tempest strong. Antistroph. IV. Then in the midst of peril he at last Shall call on those who then will hear him not. Yea, God still laughs to scorn The man by evil tide of passions borne, Swayed by thoughts wild and hot, When he beholdeth one whose boast was high He ne'er should know it, sunk in misery, And all unable round the point to steer; And so his former pride of prosperous days He wrecks upon the reefs of Vengeance drear, And dies with none to weep him or to praise.</field>
