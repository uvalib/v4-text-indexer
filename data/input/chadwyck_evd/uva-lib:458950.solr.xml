      <field name="fulltext">THE PROPHETESSE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Charinus, Aurelia, Niger. Char. You buz into my head strange likelihoods, and fill mee full of doubts; But what proofes (Niger,) what certainties, that my most noble Brother came to his end by murther? Tel me that, assure me by some circumstance. Niger. I will Sir. And as I tell you truth, so the gods prosper me. I have often nam'd this Aper. Char. True, ye have done: and in mysterious senses I have heard ye break out o'th' sudden, and abruptly. Niger. True, Sir. Fear of your unbeliefe, and the Times giddinesse made me I durst not then go farther. So your Grace please out of your wonted goodnesse to give credit, I shall unfold the wonder. Aur. Do it boldly: you shall have both our hearty loves, and hearings. Niger. This Aper then, this too much honourd villain, (for he deserves no mention of a good man) great Sir, give ear: This most ungratefull, spightfull, above the memory of mankind mischievous, with his owne bloody hands. Char. Take heed. Nig. I am in, Sir; and if I make not good my Storie. Aur. Forward: I see a Truth would break out: be not fearfull. Nig. I say, this Aper, and his damn'd Ambition, cut off your Brothers hopes, his life, and fortunes: the honourd Numerianus fell by him, fell basely, most untimely, and most treacherously: For in his Litter, as he bore him company, most privately and cunningly he kill'd him; yet still hee fils the faithfull Souldiers ears with stories of his weaknesse; of his life; that he dare not venture to appear in open, and shew his warlike face among the souldiers; the tendernesse and weaknesse of his eyes, being not able to endure the Sun yet. Slave that he is, he gives out this infirmitie (because hee would dispatch his honour too) to arise from wantonnesse, and love of women, and thus he juggles still. Aur. O most pernitious. most bloody, and most base! Alas, deer Brother, art thou accus'd, and after death thy memory loaden with shames and lies? Those pious tears thou daily showerdst upon my fathers Monument, (when in the Persian Expedition he fell unfortunately by a stroak of thunder) made thy defame and sins? Those wept out eyes, the fair examples of a noble Nature, those holy drops of Love, turn'd by depravers (malitious poyson'd tongues) to thy abuses? We must not suffer this. Char. It shows a truth now: and sure this Aper is not right nor honest, hee will not now come neer me. Nig. No, he dare not: He has an inmate here, thats call'd a conscience, bids him keep off. Char. My Brother honourd him, made him first Captain of his Guard, his next friend; then to my mother (to assure him neerer) he made him husband. Nig. And withall ambitious: for when he trod so nigh, his false feet itch'd Sir, to step into the State. Aur. If ye beleeve, Brother, Aper a bloody knave (as 'tis apparant) Let's leave disputing, and do something Noble. Char. Sister be rul'd, I am not yet so powerfull, to meet him in the field: He has under him the flower of all the Empire, and the strength, the Brittain and the Germain Cohorts; pray ye be patient. Niger, how stands the Souldier to him? Nig. In fear, more Sir, then love or honour: he has lost their fair affections, by his most covetous and greedy griping. Are ye desirous to do something on him, that all the world may know ye lov'd your Brother? and do it safely too, without an Army? Char. Most willingly. Nig. Then send out a Proscription, send suddenly: And to that man that executes it, (I mean, that brings his head) add a fair payment, no common summe: then ye shall see, I fear not, even from his own camp, from those men that follow him, follow, and flatter him, we shall find one, and if he misse, one hundred that will venture it. Aur. For his reward, it shall be so, deer Brother, so far I'll honour him that kils the villain: for so far runs my love to my dead Brother, let him be what he will; base, old, or crooked, hee shall have Me: Nay, which is more, I'll love him. I will not be denyde. Char. You shall not, Sister. But ye shall know, my Love shall go along too: See a Proscription drawn; And for his recompence, my Sister, and half partner in the Empire: and I will keep my word. Aur. Now ye do bravely. Nig. And though it cost my life, I'll see it publish'd. Char. Away then, for the businesse. Nig. I am gone, Sir: you shall have all dispatch'd to night. Char. Be prosperous. Aur. And let the villain fall. Nig. Fear nothing Madam. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Delphia and Drusilla. Dru. 'Tis true, that Diocles is courteous, and of a pleasant nature, sweet and temperate: his Cosen Maximinian, proud and bloody. Del. Yes: and mistrustfull too (my Girl) take heed, although he seem to love thee, and affect like the more Courtier, curious complement, yet have a care. Dru. You know all my affection, and all my heart-desires is set on Diocles. But (Aunt) how coldly he requites this courtesie, how dull and heavily he looks upon me, although I woo him sometimes beyond modestie, beyond a Virgins care: how still he flights me, and puts me still off with your Prophecie, and the performance of your late Prediction, that when he is Emperor, then he will marry me, alas, what hope of that? Del. Peace, and be patient, for though he be now a man most miserable, of no rank, nor no badge of honour on him, bred low and poor, no eye of favour shining: And though my sure Prediction of his Rising (which can no more faile, then the day or night do's, nay, let him be asleep, will overtake him) have found some rubs and stops, yet hear me Neece, and hear me with a faith, it shall come to him. I'll tell thee the occasion. Dru. Do good Aunt: for yet I am ignorant. Del. Chiding him one day for being too neer, and sparing for a Souldier, too griping, and too greedy: he made answer, When I am CÃ¦sar, then I will be liberall. I presently inspir'd with holy fire, and my Prophetick spirit burning in me, gave answer from the gods; and this it was, Imperator eris Roma, cum Aprum grandem interfecoris: Thou shalt be Emperor, O Diocles, when thou hast kill'd a mighty Boar. From that time (as giving credit to my words) hee has imploy'd much of his life in hunting. Many Boars hideous and fierce, with his own hands he has kild too, but yet not lighted on the fatall one, should raise him to the Empire: Be not sad Neece, ere long he shall: Come, lets go entertain him; for by this time, I ghesse, he comes from hunting: And by my art, I find this very instant some great designe 's afoot. Dru. The gods give good, Aunt. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Diocles, Maximinian, Geta, with a Boar. Dio. Lay down the Boar. Get. With all my heart; I am weary on't: I shall turn Jew, if I carry many such burthens. Do you think (Master) to be Emperor with killing Swine? ye may be an honest Butcher, or allied to a seemly Family of Sowse-wives. Can you be such an asse, my reverend Master, to think these Springs of Pork will shoot up CÃ¦sars? Max. The fool sayes true. Dio. Come leave your fooling, Sirha, and think of what thou shalt be when I am Emperor. Get. Would it would come with thinking: for then o' my conscience I should be at least a Senator. Max. A Sowter: for that's a place more fitted to thy nature, if there could be such an expectation. Or say the Divel could perform this wonder, Can such a Rascall as thou art hope for honour? such a log-carrying Lowt? Get. Yes, and bear it too, and bear it swimmingly. I am not the first Asse, Sir, has born good Office, &amp; perform'd it reverendly. Dio. Thou being the son a Tiler, canst thou hope to be a Senator? Get. Thou being son of a Tanner, canst thou hope to be an Emperour? Dio. Thou saist true Geta, there's a stop indeed; but yet the bold and vertuousâ Get. Ye are right, Master, right as a gun: For we the vertuous, though we be kennel-rakers, scabs, and scowndrels, wee the discreet and bold: and yet, now I remember it, We Tilers may deserve to be Senators; and there we step before you thick-skin'd Tanners, for we are born three Stories high; no base ones, none of your groundlings, Master. Dio. I like thee well, thou hast a good mind, as I have, to this Honour. Get. As good a mind Sir, of a simple plaistererâ and when I come to execute my Office, then you shall see. Max. What? Get. An Officer in fury; an Officer as he ought to be: Do you laugh at it? Is a Senator (in hope) worth no more reverence? By these hands I'll clap you by th'heels the first hour of it. Max. O' my conscience, the fellow beleeves. Dio. I do, do Geta, for if I once be Emperorâ Get. Then will I (for wise men must be had to prop the Republick) not bate ye a single ace of a sound Senator. Dio. But what shall we do the whilst? Get. Kill Swine, and sowse 'em, and eat 'em, when we have bread. Max. Why didst thou run away when the Boar made toward thee? art thou not valiant? Get. No indeed am I not; and 'tis for mine honour too: I took a tree, 'tis true; gave way to the Monster; heark what discretion sayes, Let furie passe; from the tooth of a mad beast, and the tongue of a slanderer preserve thine honour. Dio. Hee talks like a full Senator. Go, take it up, and carry it in: 'tis a huge one; we never kill'd so large a swine; so fierce too I never met with yet. Max. Take heed, it stirres again; how nimbly the rogue runs up: he climbs like a Squirrel. Dio. Come down ye dunce, is it not dead? Get. I know not. Dio. His throat is cut, and his bowels out. Get. That's all one, I am sure his teeth are in: and for any thing I know, he may have pigs of his own nature in's belly. Dio. Come take him up I say, and see him drest, he is fat, and will be lustie meat; away with him, and get some of him ready for our dinner. Get. Shall he be rosted whole, and serv'd up in a Sowce-tub? a portly service, I'll run i'th' wheel my self. Max. Sirrah, leave your prating, and get some piece of him ready presently, we are weary both, and hungry. Get. I'll about it. What an inundation of brewisse shall I swim in? Exit. Dio. Thou art ever dull and melancholy, Cosen, distrustfull of my hopes. Max. Why, can ye blame me? Do men give credit to a Juggler? Dio. Thou know'st she is a Prophetesse. Max. A small one, and as small profit to be hop'd for by her. Dio. Thou art the strangest man; how do's thy hurt? the Boar came neer you Sir. Max. A scratch, a scratch. Dio. It akes &amp; troubles thee, and that makes thee angry. Max. Not at the pain, but at the practice, Unkle, the butcherly base custome of our lives now: Had a brave enemies sword drawn so much from me, or danger met me in the head o'th' Army, to have blush'd thus in my blood, had been mine honour. But to live base, like Swine-herds, and beleeve too, to be fool'd out with tales, and old wives dreams, dreams, when they are drunk. Dio. Certain, you much mistake her. Max. Mistake her? hang her: to be made her Purveyors, to feed her old chaps: to provide her daily, and bring in Feasts, whilst shee sits farting at us, and blowing out her Prophecies at both ends. Dio. Preethee be wise: Dost thou think, Maximinian, so great a reverence, and so staid a knowledgeâ Max. Sur-reverence, you would say: what truth? what knowledge? what any thing but eating is good in her? 'Twould make a fool prophecie to be fed continually: What do you get? your labour and your danger. Whilst she sits bathing in her larded fury, inspir'd with full deep cups, who cannot prophecie? A Tinker, out of Ale, will give Predictions: but who beleeves? Dio. Shee is a holy Druid, A woman noted for that faith, that piety, Belov'd of heaven. Max. Heaven knows, I do not beleeve it. Indeed, I must confesse, they are excellent Jugglers; their age upon some fools too flings a confidence. But what grounds have they: what elements to work on? show mee but that: the sieve and sheers? a learned one. I have no patience to dispute this Question, 'tis so ridiculous: I think the divell do's help 'em: or rather, (mark me well) abuse 'em (Unkle): for they are as fit to deal with him: these old women, they are as jump and squar'd out to his natureâ Dio. Thou hast a perfect malice. Max. So I would have against these purblind Prophets: for look ye Sir, old women will lie monstrously; so will the divell, or else he has had much wrong: upon my knowledge, old women are malicious; so is hee: they are proud, and covetous, revengefull, lecherous: all which are excellent attributes of the Divell. They would at last seem holy; so would hee: and to vail over these villanies, they would prophecie; he gives them leave now and then to use their cunnings, which is to kill a cow, or blast a harvest, make young pigs pipe themselves to death, choak poultry, and chafe a dairy-wench into a feaver with pumping for her butter. But when he makes these Agents to raise Emperors, when he disposes Fortune as his Servant, and tyes her to old wives tailesâ Dio. Goe thy wayes, thou art a learned Scholar, against credit. You hear the Prophecie? Max. Yes, and I laugh at it: and so will any man can tell but twenty, that is not blind, as you are blind and ignorant. Do you think she knows your fortune? Dio. I do think it. Max. I know she has the name of a rare South-sayer: but do you in your conscience beleeve her holy? inspired with such prophetick fire? Dio. Yes in my conscience. Max. And that you must upon necessity from her words be a Cesar? Dio. If I live, Max. There's one stop yet. Dio. and follow her directions. Max. But do not juggle with me. Dio. In faith (Cosen,)â so full a truth hangs ever on her Prophecies, that how I should think otherwise. Max. Very well Sir: You then beleeve (for me thinks, 'tis most necessary) she knows her own Fate? Dio. I beleeve it certain. Max. Dare you but be so wise to let me try it, for I stand doubtfull. Dio. How? Max. Come neerer to me; because her cunning divell shall not prevent me: Close, close, and hear; If she can turn this destinie, I'll be of your faith too. Dio. Forward, I fear not. for if shee knows not this, sure she knows nothing. Enter Delphia. I am so confidentâ Max. 'Faith so am I too, that I shall make her Divels sides hum. Dio. Shee comes here: go take your stand. Max. Now holly, or you howl for't. Exit. Dio. 'Tis pity this young man should be so stubborn. Valiant he is, and to his valour temperate, onely distrustfull of delayes in Fortune; I love him deerly well. Del. Now my Son Diocles, are yee not weary of your game to day? and are ye well? Dio. Yes Mother, well and lustie: onely ye make me hunt for empty shadows. Del. You must have patience, Rome was not built in one day: and he that hopes, must give his hopes their currents. You have kil'd a mighty Boar. Dio. But I am no Emperor. Why do you fool me thus, and make me follow your flattering expectation hour by hour? Rise early, and sleep late? to feed your appetites, forget my trade, my Arms? forsake mine honour, labour and sweat to arrive at a base memory? oppose my self to hazzards of all sorts, onely to win the barbarous name of Butcher? Del. Son, you are wise. Dio. But you are cunning, Mother: and with that Cannon, and the faith I give ye, ye lead me blindly to no end, no honour. You find ye are daily fed, you take no labour, your familie at ease, they know no Market, and therefore to maintain this, you speak darkly, as darkly still ye nourish it, whilst I being a credulous and obsequious coxcomb, hunt daily, and sweat hourly, to find out to cleer your Mystery: kill Boar on Boar, and make your spits and pots bow with my Bounties: yet I still poorer, further stillâ Del. Be provident, and tempt not the gods doombs: stop not the glory they are ready to fix on ye. Ye are a fool then; cheerfull and gratefull takers the gods love, and such as wait their pleasures with full hopes: the doubtfull and distrustfull man Heaven frowns at. What I have told you by my inspiration, I tell ye once again, must and shall find ye. Dio. But when? or how? Del. Cum Aprum interfeceris. Dio. I have kil'd many. Del. Not the Boar they point ye: nor must I reveal further, till you cleer it. The lots of glorious men are wrapt in mysteries, and so deliverd: Common and slight creatures, that have their Ends as open as their Actions, easie and open fortunes follow. Max. I shall try how deep your inspiration lies hid in ye, and whether your brave spirit have a buckler to keep this arrow off, I'll make you smoak else. Dio. Knowing my fortune so precisely, punctually, and that it must fall without contradiction, being a stranger of no tie unto ye, me thinks you should be studied in your own, in your own destiny, me thinks, most perfect, and every hour, and every minute, Mother, so great a care should heaven have of her Ministers; me thinks your fortunes both waies should appear to ye, both to avoid, and take. Can the Stars now, and all those influences you receive into ye, or secret inspirations ye make shew of, if an hard fortune hung, and were now ready to powr it self upon your life, deliver ye? Can they now say, Take heed? Del. Ha? pray ye come hither. Max. I would know that: I fear your divel wil cozen ye, and stand as close as ye can, I shall be with ye. Del. I find a present ill. Dio. How? Del. But I scorn it. Max. Do ye so? do ye so? Del. Yes, and laugh at it, Diocles. Is it not strange, these wild and foolish men should dare to oppose the power of Destiny? that power the gods shake at? Look yonder, Son, Max. Have ye spide me? then have at ye. Del. Do, shoot boldly. hit mee and spare not, if thou canst. Dio. Shoot cosen. Max. I cannot; mine arm's dead, I have no feeling: or if I could shoot, so strong is her arm'd vertue, she would catch the arrow flying. Del. Poor doubtfull people, I pity your weak faiths. Dio. Your mercy (Mother,) and from this hour a deity, I crown ye. Del. No more of that. Max. O let my prayers prevail too, here like a tree, I dwell else: free me Mother, and greater then great Fortune, I'll adore thee. Del. Be free again, and have more pure thoughts in ye. Dio. Now I beleeve your words most constantly, and when I have that power ye have promis'd to me. Del. Remember then your vow: my Neice Drusilla, I mean, to marry her, and then ye prosper, Dio. I shall forget my life else. Del. I am a poor weak woman: to me no worship. Enter Niger, Geta, and Souldiers. Get. And shall he have as you say, that kils this Aper? Del. Now mark and understand. Nig. The Proscription's up, i'th' Market-place 'tis up, there ye may read it, he shall have half the Empire. Get. A pretty Farm i'faith. Nig. And the Emperors Sister, bright Aurelia, her to his wife. Get. Ye say well Friend; but heark ye, Who shall do this? Nig. You, if ye dare. Get. I think so: Yet I could poyson him in a pot of Perry, he loves that veng'ancely: But when I have done this, may I lie with the Gentlewoman? Nig. Lie with her? what else man? Get. Yes Man, I have known a man married, that never lay with his wife. those dancing dayes are done. Nig. These are old Souldiers, and poor, it seems. I'll try their appetites. 'Save ye brave Souldiers. Max. Sir, ye talkt of proscriptions? Nig. 'Tis true, there is one set up from the Emperour against Volutius Aper. Dio. Aper? Del. Now; Now have ye found the Boar? Dio. I have the meaning; and blessed Mother.â Nig. He has scorn'd his Master, and bloodily cut off by treachery the noble Brother to him. Dio. He lives here Sir, sickly and weak. Nig. Did you see him? Max. No. Nig. He is murthered; so ye shall find it mentioned from the Emperour; and honest faithful souldiers, but believe it; for, by the gods, you will find it so, he is murthered; the manner how, read in the large Proscription. Del. It is most true Son; and he cozens ye, Aper's a villain false. Dio. I thank ye Mother. and dare beleeve ye: Heark ye Sir, the recompence? as ye related. Nig. Is as firme as faith Sir: bring him alive or dead. Max. You took a fit time, the Generall being out o'th' Towne: for though we love him not, yet had he known this first, you had paid for't deerly. Dio. 'Tis Niger, now I know him: honest Niger, a true sound man, and I beleeve him constantly: your busines may be done, make no great hurry for your owne safety. Nig. No, I am gone: I thank ye. Exit. Dio. Pray, Maximinian, pray. Max. I'll pray and work too. Dio. I'll to the Market place, and read the offer, and now I have found the Boar. Del. Find your owne faith too, and remember what ye have vow'd. Dio. O Mother. Del. Prosper. Get. If my Master, and I do do this, there's two Emperours, and what a show will that make? how we shall bounce it? Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Drusilla and Delphia. Dru. Leave us, and not vouchsafe a parting kisse to her that in his hopes of greatnesse lives, and goes along with him in all his dangers? Del. I grant 't was most inhumane. Dru. O you give it too mild a name: 't was more then barbarous, and you a partner in't. Del. I Drusilla? Dru. Yes: you have blowne his swolne pride to that vastnes, as he beleeves the earth is in his fadom, this makes him quite forget his humble Being: And can I hope that he, that onely fed with the imagin'd food of future Empire, disdains even those that gave him Means, and life, to nourish such desires, when he's possest of his ambitious Ends (which must fall on him, or your Predictions are false) will ever descend to look on me? Del. Were his Intents perfidious as the Seas or Windes, his heart compos'd of falshood; yet the benefit, the greatnesse of the good he has from you, (for what I have conferr'd, is thine, Drusilla) must make him firm, and thankful: But if all remembrance of the debts he stands engag'd for, finde a quick grave in his Ingratitude, my powerful Art, that guides him to this height, shall make him curse the hour he ere was rais'd, or sink him to the center. Dru. I had rather your Art could force him to return that ardour to me, I bear to him; or give me power to moderate my passions: Yet I know not, I should repent your grant, though you had sign'd it, (so well I finde he's worthy of all service.) But to believe that any check to him in his main hopes, could yeeld content to me, were treason to true love, that knows no pleasure, the object that is doats on ill affected. Del. Pretty simplicity; I love thee for't, and will not sit an idle looker on, and see it cozen'd: dry thy innocent eyes, and cast off jealous fears, (yet promises are but lip-comforts) and but fancie aught that's possible in Nature, or in Art, that may advance thy comfort, and be bold to tell thy soul 'tis thine: therefore speak freely. Dru. You new create me. To conceal from you my virgin fondnesse, were to hide my sicknesse from my physitian. O dear Aunt, I languish for want of Diocles sight: he is the Sun that keeps my blood in a perpetual spring: but in his absence, cold benumming Winter seizes on all my faculties. Would you binde me (that am your slave already) in more fetters, and (in the place of service) to adore you? O bear me then (but 'tis impossible, I fear, to be effected) where I may see how my Diocles breaks thorow his dangers, and in what heaps his honours flow upon him, that I may meet him, in the height and pride of all his glories; and there (as your gift) chalenge him, as mine own. Del. Enjoy thy wishes: this is an easie Boon, which, at thy yeers, I could have given to any; but now grown perfect in all the hidden mysteries of that inimitable Art, which makes us equal even to the gods, and Natures wonders, it shall be done, as fits my skill and glory: To break thorow bolts, and locks, a Scholars prize for Theeves, and Pick-locks: To passe thorow an Army cover'd with Night, or some disguise, the practice of poor and needy Spies: No, my Drusilla, from Ceres I will force her winged Dragons, and in the air hung over the Tribunal; (the Musick of the Spheres attending on us.) There, as his good Star, thou shalt shine upon him, if he prove true, and as his Angel guard him. But if he dare be false, I, in a moment will put that glorious light out, with such horrour, as if the eternal Night had seiz'd the Sun, or all things were return'd to the first Chaos, and then appear like Furies. Dru. I will do what ere you shall command: Del. Rest then assur'd, I am the Mistris of my Art, and fear not. Exeunt. Soft Musick. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Aper, Camurius, Guard, a Litter covered. Aper. Your care of your sick Emperour, fellow-souldiers, in colours to the life, doth shew your love, and zealous duty: O continue in it. And though I know you long to see and hear him, impute it not to pride, or melancholy, that keeps you from your wishes: such State-vices (too too familiar with great Princes) are strangers to all the actions of the life of good Numerianus: Let your patience be the Physitian to his wounded eyes, (wounded with pious sorrow for his father) which Time and your strong Patience will recover, provided it prove constant. 1 Guard. If he counterfeit, I will hereafter trust a prodigal heir, when he weeps at his fathers Funeral. 2 Guard. Or a young widow, following a bed-rid husband, (after a three yeers groaning) to the Fire. 3 Guard. Note his humility, and with what soft murmures he does enquire his pleasures. 1 Guard. And how soon he is instructed. 2 Guard. How he bows again too. Aper. All your Commands (dread CÃ¦sar) I'll impart to your most ready Souldier, to obey them; so take your rest in peace. It is the pleasure of mighty CÃ¦sar (his thanks still remembred) for your long patience, which a donative, fitting his State to give, shall quickly follow) that you continue a strict Guard upon his sacred person, and admit no stranger of any other Legion, to come neer him; you being most trusted by him. I receive your answer in your silence. Now Camurius, speak without flattery; Hath thy Aper acted this passion to the life? Cam. I would applaud him, were he saluted CÃ¦sar: but I fear these long protracted counsels will undo us; and 'tis beyond my reason, he being dead, you should conceal your self, or hope it can continue undiscover'd. Aper. That I have killed him, yet feed these ignorant fools with hopes he lives, has a main end in't. The Pannonian Cohorts (that are my own, and sure) are not come up, the Germane Legions waver, and Charinus (brother to this dead dog) hells plagues on Niger, is jealous of the murther; and, I hear, is marching up against me. 'Tis not safe, till I have power, to justifie the Act, to shew my self the Authour: be therefore careful for an hour or two (till I have fully sounded how the Tribunes and Centurions stand affected) that none come neer the Litter. If I finde them firm on my part, I dare professe my self, and then live Aper's equal. Cam. Does not the body begin to putrifie? Aper. That exacts my haste: when, but even now, I feign'd obedience to it, as I had some great businesse to impart, the sent had almost choak'd me: be therefore curious: all keep at distance. Exit. Cam. I am taught my parts; haste you, to perfect yours. 1 Guard. I had rather meet an enemy in the field, then stand thus nodding like to a rug-gown'd Watch-man. Enter Diocles, Maximinian, Geta. Geta. The Watch at noon? this is a new device. Cam. Stand. Dio. I am arm'd against all danger. Max. If I fear to follow, a Cowards name pursue me. Dio. Now my Fate guide and direct me. Cam. You are rude and sawcy, with your forbidden feet to touch this ground, sacred to CÃ¦sar onely, and to these that do attend his person. Speak, what are you? Dio. What thou, nor any of thy faction are, nor ever were: Souldiers, and honest men. Cam. So blunt? Geta. Nay, you shall finde he's good at the sharp too. Dio. No instruments of craft: engines of murder, that serve the Emperour onely with oil'd tongues, sooth and applaud his vices, play the Bauds to all his appetites; and when you have wrought so far upon his weaknesse, that he's grown odious to the subject and himself, and can no further help your wicked ends, you rid him out of the way. Cam. Treason? Dio. 'Tis truth, and I will make it good. Cam. Lay hands upon 'em, or kill them suddenly. Geta. I am out at that; I do not like the sport. Dio. What's he that is owner of any vertue worth a Roman, or does retain the memory of the Oath he made to CÃ¦sar, that dares lift his sword against the man that (carelesse of his life) comes to discover such a horrid Treason, as when you hear 't, and understand how long y'ave been abus'd, will run you mad with fury? I am no stranger, but (like you) a Souldier, train'd up one from my youth: and there are some with whom I have serv'd, and (not to praise my self) must needs confesse they have seen Diocles in the late Britain Wars, both dare and do beyond a common man. 1 Guard. Diocles? 2 Guard. I know him, the bravest Souldier of the Empire. Cam. Stand: if thou advance an inch, thou art dead. Dio. Die thou, that durst oppose thy self against a Truth that will break out, though mountains cover it. Get. I fear this is a sucking Pigg; no Boar, he falls so easie. Dio. Hear me, fellow Souldiers; and if I make it not apparant to you this is an act of Justice, and no Murther, cut me in pieces: I'll disperse the cloud that hath so long obscur'd a bloody act nere equall'd yet: you all knew with what favours the good Numerianus ever grac't the Provost Aper? Guard. True. Dio. And that those bounties should have contain'd him (if he ere had learn'd the elements of Honestie and Truth) in loyal duty: But ambition never looks backward on desert, but with blinde haste boldly runs on. But I lose time. You are here commanded by this Aper to attend the Emperours person; to admit no stranger to have accesse to him, or come neer his Litter, under pretence (forsooth) his eyes are sore, and his minde troubled: no, my friends, you are cozen'd; the good Numerianus now is past the sense of wrong or injury. Guard. How? dead? Dio. Let your own eyes inform you. Get. An Emperours Cabinet? Fough, I have known a Charnel-house smell sweeter. If Emperours flesh have this favour, what will mine do, when I am rotten? 1 Guard. Most unheard-of villany: 2 Guard. And with all cruelty to be reveng'd. 3 Guard. Who is the murtherer? name him, that we may punish it in his family. Dio. Who but Aper? the barbarous and most ingrateful Aper? His desperate Poniard printed on his brest this deadly wound: hate to vow'd enemies findes a full satisfaction in death; and Tyrants seek no farther. He (a Subject, and bound by all the Ties of love and duty) ended not so; but does deny his Prince (whose ghost forbad passage to his rest, mourns by the Stygian shore) his Funeral-Rites. Nay, weep not; let your loves speak in your anger; and, to confirm you gave no suffrage to the damned Plot, lend me your helping hands to wreak the Parricide: and if you finde that there is worth in Diocles to deserve it, make him your leader. Guard. A Diocles, a Diocles. Dio. We'll force him from his Guards. And now, my Stars, if you have any good for me in store, shew it, when I have slain this fatal Boar. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Delphia and Drusilla in a Throne drawn by Dragons. Del. Fix here, and rest a while your Sail-stretch'd wings that have out-stript the windes: the eye of heaven durst not behold your speed, but hid it self behinde the grossest clouds; and the pale Moon pluckt in her silver horns, trembling for fear that my strong Spells should force her from her Sphere; such is the power of Art. Dru. Good Aunt, where are we? Del. Look down, Drusilla, on these lofty Towers, these spacious streets, where every private house appears a Palace to receive a King: the site, the wealth, the beauty of the place, will soon inform thee 't is imperious Rome, Rome, the great Mistris of the conquer'd world. Dru. But without Diocles, it is to me like any wildernesse we have pass'd ore: shall I not see him? Del. Yes, and in full glory, and glut thy greedy eyes with looking on his prosperous successe: Contain thy self; for though all things beneath us are transparent, the sharpest sighted, were he Eagle-ey'd, cannot discover us: nor will we hang idle Spectators to behold his triumph: Enter Diocles, Maximinian, Guard, Aper, Senators, Geta, Officers, (With Litter. but when occasion shall present it self, do something to adde to it. See, he comes. Dru. How god-like he appears? with such a grace the Giants that attempted to scale heaven, when they lay dead on the Phlegrean plain, Mars did appear to Jove. Del. Forbear. Dio. Look on this, and when with horrour thou hast view'd thy deed, (thy most accursed deed) be thine own judge, and see (thy guilt consider'd) if thou canst perswade thy self (whom thou stand'st bound to hate) to hope or plead for mercy. Aper. I confesse my life's a burden to me. Dio. Thou art like thy name, a cruel Boar, whose snout hath rooted up the fruitful Vineyard of the Common-wealth: I long have hunted for thee, and since now thou art in the Toyl, it is in vain to hope thou ever shalt break out: thou dost deserve the Hangmans hook, or to be punished more majorum, whipt with rods to death, or any way, that were more terrible. Yet, since my future fate depends upon thee, thus, to fulfil great Delphia's Prophecie, Aper (thou fatal Boar) receive the honour to fall by Diocles hand. Shine clear, my Stars, that usher'd me to taste this common air, in my entrance to the world, and give applause to this great work. Musick. Del. Strike Musick from the Spheres. Dru. O now you honour me. Dio. Ha? in the Air? All. Miraculous. Max. This shews the gods approve the Person, and the Act: then if the Senate (for in their eyes I read the Souldiers love) think Diocles worthy to supply the place of dead Numerianus, as he stands his heir, in his revenge, with one consent salute him Emperour. Senat. Long live Diocles: Augustus, Pater PatriÃ¦, and all Titles that are peculiar onely to the CÃ¦sars, we gladly throw upon him. Guard. We confirm it, and will defend his honour with our Swords against the world: raise him to the Tribunal. 1 Sen. Fetch the Imperial Robes: and as a signe we give him absolute power of life and death, binde this sword to his side. 2 Sen. Omit no Ceremony that may be for his honour. Song. Max. Still the gods expresse that they are pleas'd with this election. Geta. My Master is an Emperour, and I feel a Senators Itch upon me: would I could hire these fine invisible Fidlers to play to me at my instalment. Dio. I embrace your loves, and hope the honours that you heap upon me, shall be with strength supported. It shall be my studie to appear another Atlas, to stand firm underneath this heaven of Empire, and bear it boldly. I desire no Titles, but as I shall deserve 'em. I will keep the name I had, being a private man, onely with some small difference; I will adde to Diocles but two short syllables, and be called Dioclesianus. Geta. That is fine: I'll follow the fashion; and when I am a Senator, I will be no more plain Geta, but be call'd Lord Getianus. Dru. He ne'er thinks of me, nor of your favour. Enter Niger. Del. If he dares prove false, these glories shall be to him as a dream, or an inchanted banquet. Niger. From Charinus, from great Charinus, who with joy hath heard of your proceedings, and confirms your honours: he, with his beauteous sister, fair Aurelia, are come in person, like themselves attended to gratulate your fortune. Loud Musick. Enter Charinus, Aurelia, Attendants. Dio. For thy news, Be thou in France Pro-consul: let us meet the Emperour with all honour, and embrace him. Dru. O Aunt, I fear this Princesse doth eclipse th'opinion of my beauty, though I were my self to be the judge. Del. Rely on me. Char. 'Tis vertue and not birth that makes us noble: Great actions speak great mindes, and such should govern; and you are grac't with both. Thus, as a Brother, a Fellow, and Co-partner in the Empire, I do embrace you: may we live so far from difference, or emulous Competition, that all the world may say. Although two Bodies we have one Minde, Aur. When I look on the Trunk of dear Numerianus, I should wash his wounds with tears, and pay a sisters sorrow to his sad fate: but since he lives again in your most brave Revenge, I bow to you, as to a power that gave him second life, and will make good my promise. If you finde that there is worth in me that may deserve you, and that in being your wife, I shall not bring disquiet and dishonour to your Bed, Although my youth and fortune should require both to be su'd and sought to, here I yeeld my self at your devotion, Dio. O you gods, teach me how to be thankful: you have pour'd all blessings on me, that ambitious man could ever fancie: till this happie minute, I nere saw beauty, or believ'd there could be perfection in a woman. I shall live to serve and honour you: upon my knees I thus receive you; and, so you vouchsafe it, this day I am doubly married; to the Empire, and your best-self. Del. False and perfidious villain.â Dru. Let me fall headlong on him: O my Stars! this I foresaw and fear'd. Cha. Call forth a Flamen. This knot shall now be ti'd. Del. But I will loose it, if Art or Hell have any strength. Enter a Flamen. Thunder and Lightning. Cha. Prodigious! Max. How soon the day 's orecast? Fla. The Signes are fatal: Juno smiles not upon this Match, and shews too she has her thunder. Dio. Can there be a stop in my full fortune? Cha. We are too violent, and I repent the haste: we first should pay our latest duty to the dead, and then proceed discreetly. Let's take up the body, and when we have plac'd his ashes in his Urn, we'll try the gods again: for wise men say, Marriage and Obsequies do not suit one day. Senate exit. Del. So, 't is deferr'd yet, in despite of falshood: Comfort Drusilla, for he shall be thine, or wish, in vain, he were not. I will punish Ascend. his perjury to the height. Mount up, my birds; some Rites I am to perform to Hecate, to perfect my designes; which once perform'd, he shall be made obedient to thy Call, or in his ruine I will bury all. Ascends throne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Maximinian (solus.) Max. What powerful Star shin'd at this mans Nativity? and bless'd his homely Cradle with full glory? what throngs of people presse and buz about him, and with their humming flatteries sing him CÃ¦sar? sing him aloud, and grow hoarse with saluting him? How the fierce-minded Souldier steals in to him, adores and courts his Honour? at his devotion their lives, their vertues and their fortunes laying? Charinus sues, the Emperour intreats him, and as a brighter flame, takes his beams from him. The bless'd and bright Aurelia, she doats on him, and as the god of Love, burns incense to him. All eyes live on him. Yet I am still Maximinian, still the same poor and wretched thing, his servant. What have I got by this? where lies my glory? how am I rais'd and honour'd? I have gone as far to woo this purblinde Honour, and have pass'd as many dangerous Expeditions, as noble, and as high; nay, in his destinie (whilst 't was unknown) have run as many hazards, and done as much; sweat thorow as many perils; onely the Hang-man of Volutius Aper (which I mistook) has made him Emperour, and me his slave. Enter Delphia and Drusilla. Del. Stand still; he cannot see us, till I please: mark him well, this discontentment I have forc'd into him, for thy cause, Drusilla. Max. Can the gods see this; see it with justice, and confer their blessings on him, that never flung one grain of incense upon their Altars? never bow'd his knee yet; and I that have march'd foot by foot, struck equally, and whilst he was a gleaning, have been praying, contemning his base covetousâ Del. Now we'll be open. Max. Blesse me, and with all reverence. Del. Stand up, Son, and wonder not at thy ungrateful Uncle: I know thy thoughts, and I appear to ease 'em. Max. O mother, did I stand the tenth part to ye engag'd and fetter'd, as mine Uncle does, how would I serve, how would I fall before ye? the poorer powers me worship. Del. Peace, and flatter not; necessitie and anger draws this from ye; of both which I will quit ye: For your Uncle I spoke this Honour, and it fell upon him; fell, to his full content: he has forgot me, for all my care; forgot me, and his vow too: as if a dream had vanish'd, so h' as lost me, and I him: let him now stand fast. Come hither; my care is now on you. Max. O blessed Mother! Del. Stand still, and let me work. So now, Maximinian, go, and appear in Court, and eye Aurelia: beleeve, what I have done, concerns ye highly. Stand in her view, make your addresses to her: she is the Satyre of Honour. I'll say no more, but Fortune is your servant: go. Max. With reverence;â all this as holy truths. Exit. Del. Believe, and prosper. Dru. Yet all this cures not me; but as much credit, as much belief from Dioclesian. Enter Geta, Lictors, and Suitors, (with Petitions.) Del. Be not dejected; I have warn'd ye often: the proudest thoughts he has, I'll humble. Who's this? O 't is the fool and knave grown a grave Officer: here's hot and high preferment. Get. What's your Bill? for Gravel for the Appian way, and Pills? is the way rheumatick? 1 Suitor. 'T is Piles, and 't please you. Get. Remove me those Piles to Port Esquiline, fitter the place, my friend: you shall be paid. 1 Suit. I thank your Worship. Get. Thank me when ye have it; thank me another way, ye are an Asse else. I know my Office: you are for the Streets, Sir. Lord, how ye throng that knave has eaten Garlick; whip him, and bring him back. 3 Suitor. I beseech you Worship; here's an old reckoning for the dung and dirt, Sir. Get. It stinks like thee: Away. Yet let him tarry, his Bill shall quit his Breath. Give your Petitions in seemly sort, and keep your hats off, decently. For scowring the Water-courses thorow the Cities? a fine periphrasis of a kennel-raker. Did ye scour all, my friend? ye had some businesse: who shall scour you? you are to be paid, I take it, when Surgeons swear you have performed your Office. 4 Suit. Your Worship's merry. Get. We must be sometimes wittie, to nick a knave; 't is as useful as our gravitie. I'll take no more Petitions; I am pester'd; give me some rest. 4 Suit. I have brought the gold (and 't please ye) about the Place ye promised. Get. See him enter'd. How does your daughter? 4 Suit. Better your Worship thinks of her. Get. This is with the least. But let me see your daughter. 'T is a good forward maid; I'll joyn her with ye. I do beseech ye, leave me. Lictor. Ye see the Edile's busie. Get. And look to your Places, or I'll make ye smoke else. Sirha, I drank a cup of wine at your house yesterday; a good smart wine. Lict. Send him the piece, he likes it. Get. And ate the best wilde Boar at that same Farmors. 2 Su. I have half left yet: your Worship shall command it Get. A bit will serve: give me some rest: gods help me. How shall I labour when I am a Senator? Del. 'T is a fit place indeed. 'Save your Mastership; do you know us, Sir? Get. These women are still troublesom. There be houses providing for such wretched women, and some small Rents, to set ye a spinning. Dru. Sir, we are no Spinsters; nor, if you look upon us, so wretched as you take us. Del. Does your Mightinesse that is a great destroyer of your Memorie, yet understand our faces? Get. 'Prethee keep off, woman; it is not fit I should know every creature. Although I have been familiar with thee heretofore, I must not know thee now: my place neglects thee. Yet, because I daign a glimpse of your remembrances, give me your Suits, and wait me a month hence. Del. Our Suits are (Sir) to see the Emperour, the Emperour Dioclesian, to speak to him, and not to wait on you. We have told you all, Sir. Get. I laugh at your simplicitie, poor women: see the Emperour? why you are deceiv'd: now the Emperour appears but once in seven yeers, and then he shines not on such weeds as you are. Forward, and keep your State, and keep beggers from me. Drus. Here is a prettie youth. Exeunt. Enter Diocles. Del. He shall be prettie, or I will want my will, since ye are so high, Sir: I'll raise ye higher, or my art shall fail me. Stand close, he comes. Dio. How am I cross'd and tortur'd? my most wish'd happinesse, my lovely Mistris, that must make good my hopes, and link my greatnesse, yet sever'd from mine arms? Tell me, high heaven, how have I sinn'd, that you should speak in thunder, in horrid thunder, when my heart was ready: to leap into her brest? the Priest was ready? the joyful virgins and the young men ready? when Hymen stood with all his flames about him blessing the bed? the house with full joy sweating? and expectation, like the Romane Eagle, took stand, and call'd all eyes? It was your Honour; and ere you give it full; do you destroy it? or was there some dire Star? some devil that did it? some sad malignant Angel to mine honour? With you, I dare not rage. Del. With me thou canst not, though it was I. Nay, look not pale and frighted; I'll fright thee more. With me thou canst not quarrel; I rais'd the thunder, to rebuke thy falshood: look here, to her thy falshood. Now be angry, and be as great in evil as in Empire. Dio. Blesse me, ye Powers. Del. Thou hast full need of blessing. 'T was I, that at thy great Inauguration, hung in the air unseen: 't was I that honoured thee with various Musicks, and sweet sounding airs: 't was I inspired the souldiers heart with wonder, and made him throw himself, with love and duty, lowe as thy feet: 't was I that fix'd him to thee. But why did I all this? To keep thy honestie, thy vow and faith, that once forgot and slighted Aurelia in regard, the Marriage ready, the Priest and all the Ceremonies present. 'T was I that thundred loud; 't was I that threatned; 't was I that cast a dark face over heaven, and smote ye all with terrour. Drus. Yet consider, as ye are noble, as I have deserv'd ye; for yet ye are free: if neither faith nor promise, the deeds of elder times may be remembred, let these new-dropping tears; for I still love ye, these hands held up to heaven. Dio. I must not pitie ye; 't is not wise in me. Del. How? not wise? Dio. Nor honourable. A Princesse is my Love, and doats upon me: a fair and lovely Princesse is my Mistris. I am an Emperour: consider, Prophetesse, now my embraces are for Queens and Princesses, for Ladies of high mark, for divine beauties: to look so lowe as this cheap common sweetnesse, would speak me base, my names and glories nothing. I grant I made a vow; what was I then? as she is now, of no sort (Hope made me promise) but now I am: to keep this vow, were monstrous, a madnesse, and a lowe inglorious fondnesse. Del. Take heed, proud man. Drus. Princes may love with Titles, but I with Truth. Del. Take heed; here stands thy destinie; thy Fate here follows. Dio. Thou doating Sorceresse, wouldst have me love this Thing, that is not worthy to kneel unto my Saint? to kisse her shadow? Great Princes are her slaves; selected beauties bow at her beck: the mighty Persian's daughter (bright as the breaking East, as the mid-day glorious) waits her commands, and grows proud in her pleasures. I'll see her honour'd: some Watch I shall think of, that shall advance ye both; mean time I'll favour ye. Exit. Del. Mean time I'll haunt thee. Cry not (wench) be confident, ere long, thou shalt more pitie him (observe me) and pitie him in truth, then now thou seek'st him: my Art and I are yet companions. Come, Girl. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Geta, Lictors. Get. I am too merciful, I finde it (friends) of too soft a nature to be an Officer; I bear too much remorse. 1 Lict. 'T is your own fault, Sir; for look you, One so newly warm in Office should lay about him blindfold, like true Justice, hit where it will: the more ye whip and hang, Sir, (though without cause; let that declare it self afterward) the more ye are admired. Get. I think I shall be.â 2 Lict. Your Worship is a man of a spare body, and prone to anger. Get. Nay, I will be angry, and, the best is, I need not shew my reason. 2 Lict. You need not, Sir, your place is without reason; and what you want in growth and full proportion, make up in rule and rigour. Get. A rare Counsellor; instruct me further. Is it fit, my friends, the Emperour my Master Dioclesian should now remember or the Times or Manners that call'd him plain down Diocles? 1 Lict. He must not, it stands not with his Royaltie. Get. I grant ye, I being then the Edile Getianus, a man of Place, and Judge, it is held requisite I should commit to my consideration those Rascals of removed and ragged hours, that with unreverend mouthes call'd me Slave Geta? 2 Lict. You must forget their names; your Honour bids ye. Get. I do forget; but I'll hang their natures: I will ascend my Place, which is of Justice; and Mercy, I forget thee. Suitor. A rare Magistrate; another Solon sure. Get. Bring out the offenders. 1 Lict. There are none yet, Sir, but no doubt there will be. but if you please touch some things of those natures. Get. And am I ready, and mine anger too? the melancholy of a Magistrate upon me, and no offenders to execute my fury? Ha? no offenders, knaves? 1 Lict. There are knaves indeed, Sir, but we hope shortly to have 'em for your Worship. Get. No men to hang or whip? are you good Officers, that provide no fuel for a Judges fury? in this Place something must be done; this Chair, I tell ye, when I sit down, must favour of Severitie: therefore I warn ye all, bring me lewd people, or likely to be lewd; twigs must be cropt too: let me have evil persons in abundance, or make 'em evil; 't is all one, do but say so, that I may have fit matter for a Magistrate; and let me work. If I sit empty once more, and lose my longing, as I am true Edile, and as I hope to rectifie my Countrie, you are those scabs I will scratch off from the Commonwealth: you are those Rascals of the State I treat of, and you shall finde and feel.â 2 Lict. You shall have many, many notorious people. Get. Let 'em be people, and take ye notorious to your selves. Mark me, my Lictors, and you, the rest of my Officials; If I be angry, as my place will ask it, and want fit matter to dispose my Authoritie, I'll hang a hundred of ye: I'll not stay longer, nor enquire no further into your offences: it is sufficient that I finde no Criminals, and therefore I must make some: if I cannot, suffer my self; for so runs my Commission. Suitor. An admirable, zealous and true Justice. 1 Lict. I cannot hold: if there be any people, of what degree soever, or what qualitie, that would behold the wonderful works of Justice in a new Officer, a man conceal'd yet, let him repair, and see, and hear, and wonder at the most wise and gracious Getianus. Enter Delphia and Drusilla. Get. This qualifies a little. What are these? Del. You shall not mourn still: times of recreation, to allay this sadnesse, must be sought. What's here? a superstitious flock of senslesse people worshipping a signe in Office? Get. Lay hold on her, and hold her fast, she'll slip thorow your fingers like an Eel else; I know her tricks: hold her, I say, and binde her, or hang her first, and then I'll tell her wherefore. Del. What have I done? Get. Thou hast done enough to undo thee; thou hast pressed to the Emperours presence without my warrant, I being his key and image. Del. You are an image indeed, and of the coursest stuff, and the worst making that ere I look'd on yet: I'll make as good an image of an Asse. Get. Besides, thou art a woman of a lewd life. Del. I am nowhere, Sir, nor no common fame has yet proclaim'd me to the people, vitious. Get. Thou art to me a damnable lewd woman, which is as much as all the people swore it; I know thou art a keeper of tame devils: and whereas great and grave men of my Place can by the Laws be allow'd but one apiece, for their own services and recreations; thou, like a traiterous quean, keepst twenty devils; twenty in ordinary. Del. Pray ye, Sir, be pacified, if that be all: and if ye want a servant, you shall have one of mine shall serve for nothing, faithful, and diligent, and a wise devil too; think for what end. Get. Let her alone, 't is useful; we men of businesse must use speedie servants: let me see your family. Del. Think but one, he is ready. Get. A devil for intelligence? No, no, he will lye beyond all travellers. A State-devil? Neither; he will undo me at mine own weapon. For execution? he will hang me too. I would have a handsom, pleasant and a fine she-devil, to entertain the Ladies that come to me; a travell'd devil too, that speaks the tongues, and a neat carving devil. Musick. Enter a she-devil. Del. Be not fearful. Get. A prettie brown devil ifaith; may I not kisse her? Del. Yes, and embrace her too; she is your servant. Fear not; her lips are cool enough. Get. She is marvellous well mounted; what's her name? Del. Lucifera. Get. Come hither, Lucifera, and kisse me. Del. Let her sit on your knee. Get. The Chair turns: hey-boys: pleasant ifaith, and a fine facetious devil. Dance. Del. She would whisper in your ear, and tell ye wonders. Get. Come; what's her name? Del. Lucifera. Get. Come, Lucie, come, speak thy minde. I am certain burnt to ashes. Exeunt. I have a kinde of Glasse-house in my cod-piece. Are these the flames of State? I am rosted over, over, and over-rosted. Is this Office? the pleasures of Authoritie? I'll no more on't, till I can punish devils too; I'll quit it. Some other Trade now, and some course lesse dangerous, or certainly I'll tyle again for two pence. Exit. ScÅna Tertia. Enter Charinus, Aurelia, Cassana, Ambassadours, Attendants. Aur. Never dispute with me; you cannot have her: nor name the greatnesse of your King; I scorn him: your knees to me are nothing; should he bow too, it were his dutie, and my power to slight him. Cha. She is her woman; never sue to me; and in her power to render her, or keep her; and she, my sister, not to be compell'd, nor have her own snatch'd from her. Amb. We desire not, but for what ransom she shall please to think of; Jewels, or Towns, or Provinces. Aur. No ransom, âNo, not your Kings own head, his crown upon it, and all the lowe subjections of his People. Am. Fair Princes should have tender thoughts. Aur. Is she too good to wait upon the mighty Emperours sister? What Princesse of that sweetnesse, or that excellence, sprung from the proudest, and the mightiest Monarchs, but may be highly blest to be my servant? Cas. 'Tis most true, mighty Lady. Aur. Has my fair usage made you so much despise me and your fortune, that ye grow weary of my entertainments? Henceforward, as ye are, I will command ye, and as you were ordain'd my prisoner, my slave, and one I may dispose of any way, no more my fair Companion: tell your King so: and if he had more sisters, I would have 'em, and use 'em as I please. You have your Answer. Amb. We must take some other way: force must compel it. Exit. Enter Maximinian. Max. Now if thou beest a Prophetesse, and canst do things of that wonder that thy tongue delivers, canst raise me too: I shall be bound to speak thee: I half believe, confirm the other to me, and Monuments to all succeeding Ages, of thee, and of thy piety.âNow she eyes me. Now work great power of Art: she moves unto me: how sweet, how fair, and lovely her aspects are? her eyes are like bright Ioan flames shot thorow me. Aur. O my fair friend, where have you been? Max. What am I? what does she take me for? Work still, work strongly. Aur. Where have you fled, my loves and my embraces? Max. I am beyond my wits. Aur. Can one poor Thunder, whose causes are as common as his noises, make ye defer your lawful and free pleasures? strike terrour to a Souldiers heart, a Monarchs? Thorow all the fires of angry heaven, thorow tempests that sing of nothing but destruction, even underneath the bolt of Jove, then ready, and aiming dreadfully, I would seek you, and flie into your arms. Max. I shall be mighty, and (which I never knew yet) I am goodly; for certain, a most handsom man. Cha. Fie, sister, what a forgetful weaknesse is this in ye? what a light presence? these are words and offers due onely to your husband Dioclesian; this free behaviour onely his. Aur. 'Tis strange that onely empty Names compel Affections: this man, ye see, give him what name or title, let it be nere so poor, nere so despis'd (brother) this lovely man.â Max. Though I be hang'd, I'll forward: for (certain) I am excellent, and knew not. Aur. This rare and sweet young man, see how he looks, Sir, Max. I'll justle hard, dear Uncle. Aur. This Thing, I say, let him be what he will, or bear what fortune, this most unequall'd man, this spring of beauty deserves the bed of Juno. Cha. You are not mad. Max. I hope she be; I am sure I am little better. Aur. O fair, sweet man! Cha. For shame refrain this impudence. Max. Would I had her alone, that I might seal this blessing: sure, sure she should not beg: If this continue, as I hope (heaven) it will; Uncle, I'll nick ye, I'll nick ye, by this life. Some would fear killing in the pursuit now of so rare a venture; Enter Diocles. I am covetous to die for such a Beauty. Mine Uncle comes: now, if she stand, I am happie. Cha. Be right again, for honours sake. Dio. Fair Mistrisâ Aur. What man is this? Away. What sawcy fellow? dare any such base groom presse to salute me? Dio. Have ye forgot me (Fair) or do you jest with me? I'll tell ye what I am: come, 'pray ye look lovely. Nothing but frowns and scorns? Aur. Who is this fellow? Dio. I'll tell ye who I am: I am your husband. Aur. Husband to me? Dio. To you. I am Dioclesian. Max. More of this sport, and I am made, old mother: effect but this thou hast begun. Dio. I am he (Lady) reveng'd your brothers death; slew cruel Aper: I am he the Souldier courts, the Empire honours, your Brother loves: am he (my lovely Mistris) will make you Empresse of the world. Max. Still excellent: Now I see too, mine Uncle may be cozen'd. An Emperour may suffer like another. Well said (old mother) hold but up this miracle. Aur. Thou lyest; thou art not he: thou a brave fellow? Cha. Is there no shame, no modestie in women? Aur. Thou one of high and full mark? Dio. Gods, what ails she? Aur. Generous and noble? Fie, thou lyest most basely. Thy face, and all aspect upon thee, tells me thou art a poor Dalmatian slave, a lowe thing not worth the name of Romane: stand off farther. Dio. What may this mean? Aur. Come hither, my Endymion; come, shew thy self, and all eyes be blessed in thee. Dio. Hah? what is this? Aur. Thou fair Star that I live by, look lovely on me, break into full brightnesse: Look, here's a face now, of another making, another mold; here's a divine proportion, eyes fit for PhÅbus self, to gild the world with; and there's a brow arch'd like the state of heaven; look how it bends, and with what radience, as if the Synod of the gods sate under: look there, and wonder: now behold that fellow, that admirable thing, cut with an ax out. Max. Old woman, though I cannot give thee recompence, yet (certainly) I'll make thy name as glorious. Dio. Is this in truth? Cha. She is mad, and you must pardon her. Dio. She hangs upon him: see. Cha. Her fit is strong now: be not you passionate. Dio. She kisses. Cha. Let her; 't is but the fondnesse of her fit. Dio. I am fool'd, and if I suffer this. Cha. Pray ye (friend) be pacified, this will be off anon: she goes in. Exit Aurelia. Dio. Sirha. Max. What say you, Sir? Dio. How dare thy lips, thy base lips? Max. I am your kinsman Sir, and no such base one: I sought no kisses, nor I had no reason to kick the Princesse from me: 't was no manners: I never yet compell'd her: of her courtesie what shee bestows Sir, I am thankfull for. Dio. Be gone villain. Max. I will, and I will go off with that glory, and magnifie my fate. Exit. Dio. Good brother leave me, I am to my self a trouble now. Char. I am sorry for't. You'll find it but a woman-fit to try ye. Dio. It may be so; I hope so. Cha. I am asham'd, and what I think I blush at. Exit. Dio. What misery hath my great Fortune bred me? and how far must I suffer? Poor and low States, though they know wants and hungers, know not these, know not these killing Fates: Little contents them, and with that little they live, Kings commanding, and ordering both their Ends and Loves. O Honour! how geedily men seek thee, and once purchased, how many enemies to mans peace bringst thou? how many griefs and sorrows, that like sheers, like fatall sheers, are sheering off our lives still? how many sad ecclipses do we shine thorow? Enter Delphia, Drusilla vail'd. When I presum'd I was bless'd in this fair woman, Del. Behold him now, and tell me how thou likest him. Dio. When all my hopes were up, and Fortune dealt me even for the greatest and the happiest Monarch, then to be cozen'd, to be cheated basely? by mine owne kinsman cross'd? O villain kinsman! Curse of my blood; because a little younger, a little smoother fac'd: O false, false woman, false and forgetfull of thy faith: I'll kill him. But can I kill her hate too? No: he wooes not, nor worthie is of death, because she follows him, because she courts him: Shall I kill an innocent? O Diocles! would thou hadst never known this, nor surfeited upon this sweet Ambition, that now lies bitter at thy heart: O Fortune, that thou hast none to fool and blow like bubbles, but Kings, and their Contents! Del. What think ye now, Girl? Dru. Upon my life, I pity his misfortune. See how he weeps; I cannot hold. Del. Away fool; he must weep bloody tears before thou hast him. How fare ye now, brave Dioclesian? What? lazie in your loves? has too much pleasure dull'd your most mighty faculties? Dio. Art thou there? more to torment me? Dost thou come to mock me? Del. I doe: and I do laugh at all thy suffrings. I that have wrought 'em come to scorn thy wailings: I told thee once, This is thy fate, this woman, and as thou usest her, so thou shalt prosper. It is not in thy power to turn this destiny, not stop the torrent of those miseries (if thou neglect her still) shall fall upon thee. Sigh that thou art dishonest, false of faith, proud, and dost think no power can crosse thy pleasures; thou wilt find a Fate above thee. Dru. Good Aunt speak mildly: see how he looks and suffers. Dio. I find and feel, woman, that I am miserable. Del. Thou art most miserable. Dio. That as I am the most, I am most miserable. But didst thou work this? Del. Yes, and will pursue it. Dio. Stay there, and have some pity: fair Drusilla, let me perswade thy mercy, thou hast lov'd mee, although I know my suit will sound unjustly to make thy love the means to lose it selfe, have pity on me. Dru. I will do. Del. Peace Neece. although this softnesse may become your love, your care must scorn it. Let him still contemn thee, And still I'll work: the same affection he ever shews to thee, be it sweet or bitter, the same Aurelia shall shew him; no further: nor shall the wealth of all his Empire free this. Dio. I must speak fair. Lovely young maid, forgive me, look gently on my sorrows: You that grieve too; I see it in your eyes, and thus I meet it. Dru. O Aunt, I am bless'd. Dio. Be not both young and cruell, again I beg it, thus. Dru. Thus, Sir, I grant it. Enter Aurelia. He's mine own now, Aunt. Del. Not yet (Girl) thou art cozen'd. Aur. O my deer Lord, how have I wrong'd your patience? how wandred from the truth of my affections? how (like a wanton fool) shun'd that I lov'd most? but you are full of goodnesse to forgive, Sir, as I of griefe to beg, and shame to take it: sure I was not my self, some strange illusion, or what you please to pardon. Dio. All, my Deerest; all, my Delight; and with more pleasure take thee, then if there had been no such dream: for certain, it was no more. Aur. Now you have seal'd forgivenesse, I take my leave; and the gods keep your goodnesse. Exit. Del. You see how kindnesse prospers: be but so kind to marry her, and see then what new fortunes, new joyes, and pleasures; far beyond this Lady, beyond her Greatnesse too. Dio. I'll die a dog first. Now I am reconcil'd, I will enjoy her in spight of all thy spirits, and thy witchcrafts. Del. Thou shalt not (fool). Dio. I will, old doating Divels; and wert thou any thing but air and spirit, my sword should tell thee. Del. I contemn thy threatnings, and thou shalt know I hold a power above thee. Wee must remove Aurelia: Come, farewell fool, when thou shalt see me next, thou shalt bow to me. Dio. Look thou appear no more to crosse my pleasures. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Chorus. So full of matter is our Historie, Yet mix'd, I hope with sweet varietie, The accidents not vulgar too, but rare, And fit to be presented, that there wants Room in this narrow Stage, and time to expresse In Action to the life, our Dioclesian In his full lustre: Yet (as the Statuarie, That by the large size of Alcides foot, Ghess'd at his whole proportion) so wee hope, Your apprehensive judgements will conceive Out of the shadow we can only shew, How fair the body was; and will be pleas'd, Out of your wonted goodnesse, to behold As in a silent Mirrour, what we cannot With fit conveniencie of time, allow'd For such Presentments, cloath in vocall sounds. Yet with such Art the Subject is conveigh'd, That every Scene and passage shall be cleer Even to the grossest understander here. Loud Musick. Dumb Shew. Enter (at one door) Delphia, Ambassadors, they whisper together; they take an oath upon her hand; She circles them (kneeling) with her Magick rod; They rise and draw their Swords. Enter (at the other door) Dioclesian, Charinus, Maximinian, Niger, Aurelia, Cassana, Guard; Charinus and Niger perswading Aurelia; She offers to imbrace Maximinian; Diocles draws his sword, keeps off Maximinian, turns to Aurelia, kneels to her, laies his sword at her feet, she scornfully turns away: Delphia gives a signe; the Ambassadors and Souldiers rush upon them, seise on Aurelia, Cassana, Charinus, and Maximinian; Dioclesian and others offer to rescue them; Delphia raises a Mist: Exeutt Ambassadors and Prisoners, and the rest discontented. The skilfull Delphia finding by sure proof The presence of Aurelia dim'd the beauty Of her Drusilla; and in spight of Charms, The Emperour her Brother, Great Charinus, Still urg'd her to the love of Dioclesian, Deals with the Persian Legats, that were bound For the Ransom of Cassana, to remove Aurelia, Maximinian, and Charinus Out of the sight of Rome; but takes their oathes (In lieu of her assistance) that they shall not On any terms, when they were in their power, Presume to touch their lives: This yeelded to, They lie in ambush for 'em. Dioclesian Still mad for fair Aurelia, that doated As much upon Maximinian, twice had kill'd him, But that her frown restrain'd him: He pursues her With all humilitie; but she continues Proud and disdainfull. The sign given by Delphia, The Persians break thorow, and seize upon Charinus and his Sister, with Maximinian, And free Cassana. For their speedy rescue, Enraged Dioclesian draws his sword, And bids his Guard assist him: Then too weak Had been all opposition and resistance The Persians could have made against their fury, If Delphia by her cunning had not rais'd A foggie mist, which as a cloud conceal'd them, Deceiving their Pursuers. Now be pleas'd, That your Imaginations may help you To think them safe in Persia, and Dioclesian For this disastre circled round with sorrow, Yet mindfull of the wrong. Their future fortunes Wee will present in Action; and are bold In that which follows, that the Most shall say, 'Twas well begun, but the End crown'd the Play. Exit. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Diocles, Niger, Senators, Guard. Dio. Talk not of comfort; I have broke my faith, and the Gods fight against me: and proud man, how-ever magnified, is but as dust before the raging whirlwind of their justice. What is it to be great? ador'd on earth? when the immortall Powers that are above us turn all our blessings into horrid curses, and laugh at our resistance, or prevention of what they purpose? O the Furies that I feel within me! whip'd on, by their angers, for my tormentors. Could it else have been in Nature, that a few poor fugitive Persians, unfriended, and unarmed too, could have rob'd me (in Rome, the worlds Metropolis, and her glory; in Rome, where I command, inviron'd round with such invincible Troops that know no fear, but want of noble Enemies) of those jewels I priz'd above my life, and I want power to free them, if those gods I have provok'd had not given spirit to the undertakers, and in their deed protected 'em? Nig. Great CÃ¦sar, your safetie does confirm you are their care, and that how-ere their practices reach others, you stand above their malice. 1 Sen. Rome in us offers (as means to further your revenge) the lives of her best Citizens, and all they stand possess'd of. 1 Gu. Do but lead us on with that invincible and undaunted courage which waited bravely on you, when you appear'd the Minion of Conquest: Married rather to glorious Victory, and we will drag (though all the enemies of life conspire against our undertakings) the proud Persian out of his strongest hold. 2. Gu. Be but your self, and do not talk but doe. 3 Gu. You have hands and swords, Limbs to make up a well proportion'd Army, that onely want in you an Head to lead us. Dio. The gods reward your goodnesse; and beleeve, how-ere (for some great sin) I am mark'd out the object of their hate, though Jove stood ready to dart his three-fold thunder, on this head, it could not fright me from a fierce pursuit of my revenge: I will redeem my friends, and with my friends mine honour; at least fall like to my self, a Souldier. Nig. Now we hear Great Dioclesian speak. Dio. Draw up our Legions, and let it be your care (my much lov'd Niger) to hasten the remove: And fellow-souldiers, your love to me will teach you to endure both long and tedious marches. 1 Gu. Die hee accurs'd that thinks of rest or sleep, before he sets his foot on Persian earth. Nig. Wee know our glory: the dignitie of Rome, and what's above all can be urg'd, the quiet of your mind depends upon our hast. Dio. Remove to night: five dayes shall bring me to you. All. Happinesse to Cesar, and glorious victorie. Exeunt. Dio. The cheerfulnesse of my Souldiers gives assurance of good successe abroad; if first I make my peace at home here. There is something chides me, and sharply tels me, that my breach of faith to Delphia and Drusilla, is the ground of my misfortunes: And I must remember, while I was lov'd, and in great Delphia's grace, she was as my good angell, and bound Fortune to prosper my designes: I must appease her: Let others pay their knees, their vows, their prayers to weak imagin'd Powers; shee is my All, and thus I do invoke her. Knowing Delphia, thou more then woman, and though thou vouchsafest to grace the earth with thy celestiall steps, and taste this grosser air, thy heavenly spirit hath free accesse to all the secret counsels which a full Senat of the gods determine when they consider man: The brasse-leav'd book of Fate lies open to thee, where thou read'st, and fashionest the destinies of men at thy wish'd pleasure: Look upon thy creature, and as thou twice hast pleased to appear to reprehend my falshood, now vouchsafe to see my lowe submission. Del. What's thy will? false, and unthankfull, (and in that deserving all humane sorrowes) dar'st thou hope from me relief or comfort? Dio. Penitence does appease th'incensed Powers, and Sacrifice takes off their heavie angers; thus I tender both: the Master of great Rome, and in that, Lord of all the Sun gives heat and being to, thus sues for mercy: Be but as thou wert, the Pilot to the Bark of my good fortunes, and once more steer my Actions to the Port of glorious honour, and if I fall off hereafter from my faith to this sweet Virgin, joyne with those Powers that punish perjury, to make me an example, to deter others from being false. Dru. Upon my soul you may beleeve him: nor did he ere purpose to me but nobly; hee made triall how I could endure unkindnesse; I see Truth triumphat in his sorrow. Deerest Aunt, both credit him, and help him; and on assurance that what I plead for, you cannot deny, I raise him thus, and with this willing kisse I seale his pardon. Dio. O that I ere look'd beyond this abstract of all womans goodnesse. Del. I am thine again; thus I confirm our league: I know thy wishes, and how much thou fufferst in honour for thy friends: thou shalt repair all; for to thy fleet I'll give a fore-right winde to passe the Persian gulf; remove all lets that may molest thy souldiers in their March that passe by land: and destiny is false, if thou prove not victorious: Yet remember, when thou art rais'd up to the highest point of humane happinesse, such as move beyond it must of necessitie descend. Think on't, and use those blessings that the gods powre on you with moderation. Dio. As their Oracle I hear you, and obey you, and will follow your grave directions. Del. You will not repent it. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Niger, Geta, Guard, Souldiers, Ensignes. Nig. How do you like your entrance to the Warre? when the whole Body of the Army moves, shews it not gloriously? Get. 'Tis a fine May-game: but eating and drinking I think are forbad in't, (I mean, with leasure) wee walk on, and feed like hungry boyes that haste to School; or as we carried fish to the City, dare stay no where, for fear our ware should stink. 1. Gu. That's the necessitie of our speedy March. Get. Sir, I doe love my ease, and though I hate all Seats of Judicature, I mean in the Citie, for conveniencie, I still will be a Justice in the War, and ride upon my foot-cloth. I hope a Captain (and a gown'd-Captain too) may be dispens'd with. I tell you, and do not mock me, when I was poor, I could endure like others, cold and hunger: but since I grew rich, let but my finger ake, or feel but the least pain in my great toe, unlesse I have a Doctor, mine own Doctor, that may assure me, I am gone. Nig. Come, fear not; you shall want nothing. 1. Gu. We will make you fight as you were mad. Get. Not too much of fighting, Friend: it is thy trade, that art a common souldier: We Officers, by our place, may share the spoile, and never sweat for't. 2. Gu. You shall kil for practice but your dozen or two a day. Get. Thou talkst as if thou wert lowsing thy self: but yet I will make danger. If I prove one of the Worthies, so: However, I'll have the fear of the gods before my eyes, and doe no hurt, I warrant you. Nig. Come, March on, and humour him for our mirth. 1. Gu. 'Tis a fine peak-goose. Nig. But one that fools to the Emperor, and in that, a wise man and a Souldier. 1. Gu. True moralitie. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na quarta. Enter Cosroe, Cassana, Persians; and Charinus, Maximinian, Aurelia (bound) with Souldiers. Cos. Now by the Persian gods, most truly welcom, encompass'd thus with tributary kings, I entertain you. Lend your helping hands to seat her by me: and thus rais'd, bow all, to do her honour: O, my best Cassana, Sister, and partner of my life and Empire, wee'll teach thee to forget with present pleasures thy late captivitie: and this proud Roman, that us'd thee as a slave, and did disdain a Princely Ransom, shall (if she repine) be forc'd by various Tortures, to adore what she of late contemn'd. Cas. All greatnesse ever attend Cosroe: though Persia be stil'd the nurse of pomp and pride; wee'll leave to Rome her native crueltie. For know Aurelia, a Roman Princesse, and a Cesars Sister, though now, like thee captiv'd, I can forget. thy barbarous usage: and though thou to me (when I was in thy power) didst shew thy self a most insulting Tyrannesse, I to thee may prove a gentle Mistris. Aur. O my Stars, a Mistris? can I love and owe that name to flesh and bloud? I was borne to command, train'd up in Soveraigntie; and I, in death can quit the name of slave: She that scorns life, may mock captivitie. Char. Rome will be Rome when we are nothing: and her powr's the same which you once quak'd at. Max. Dioclesian lives; hear it, and tremble: Lives (thou King of Persia) the Master of his fortune, and his honour: and though by divelish Arts wee were surpriz'd, and made the prey of Magick and of Theft, and not won nobly, we shall be redeem'd, and by a Roman war; and every wrong we suffer here, with interest, be return'd on the insulting doer. 1 Per. Sure these Romanes are more then men. 2 Per. Their great hearts will not yeeld, they cannot bend to any adverse Fate, such is their confidence. Cosr. They then shall break. Why, you rebellious wretches, dare you still contend, when the least breath, or nod of mine marks you out for the fire? or to be made the prey of wolfs or vultures? The vain name of Roman Legions, I slight thus, and scorn: and for that boasted bug-bear, Dioclesian (which you presume on) would he were the Master but of the spirit, to meet me in the field, hee soon should find, that our immortall Squadrons, that with full numbers ever are supyli'd, (could it be possible they should decay) dare front his boldest Troops, and scatter 'em, as an high towring Falcon on her Stretches, severs the fearfull fowl. And by the Sun, the Moon, the Winds, the nourishers of life, and by this Sword, the instrument of death, since that you fly not humbly to our Mercy, but yet dare hope your libertie by force; if Dioclesian dare not attempt to free you with his sword, all slavery that crueltie can find out to make you wretched, falls heavie on you. Max. If the Sun keeps his course, and the earth can bear his souldiers march, I fear not. Aur. Or libertie, or revenge. Char. On that I build too. A Trumpet. Aur. A Roman Trumpet! Max. 'Tis: Comes it not like a pardon to a man condemn'd? Cosr. Admit him. Enter Niger. The purpose of thy coming? Nig. My great Master, the Lord of Rome, (in that all Power is spoken) hoping that thou wilt prove a noble Enemie, and (in thy bold resistance) worth his conquest, defies thee, Cosroe. Max. There is fire in this. Nig. And to encourage thy laborious powers to tug for Empire, dares thee to the Field, with this assurance, If thy sword can win him, or force his Legions with thy barbed horse, but to forsake their ground, that not alone wing'd Victory shall take stand on thy Tent, but all the Provinces, and Kingdomes held by the Roman Garrisons in this Eastern world, shall be delivered up, and hee himself acknowledge thee his Soveraign. In return of this large offer, he asks onely this, That till the doubtfull Dye of War determine who has most power, and should command the other, thou wouldst intreat thy Prisoners like their births, and not their present Fortune: and to bring 'em (guarded) into thy Tent, with thy best Strengths, thy ablest men of war, and thou thy self sworn to make good the place. And if he fail (maugre all opposition can be made) in his own person to compell his way, and fetch them safely off, the day is thine, and hee (like these) thy prisoner. Cosr. Though I receive this but as a Roman brave, I doe imbrace it, and love the sender. Tell him, I will bring my Prisoners to the field, and without ods, against his single force, alone defend 'em; or else with equall numbers. Courage, noble Princes, and let Posteritie record, that we this memorable day restor'd to Persia, that Empire of the world, great Philips son ravish'd from us, and Greece gave up to Rome. This our strong comfort, that we cannot fall ingloriously, since we contend for all. Exeunt. Flourish, Alarms. ScÃ¦na quinta. Enter Geta, Guard, Souldiers. Get. I'll swear the peace against 'em, I am hurt, run for a Surgeon, or I faint. 1. Gu. Bear up man, 'tis but a scratch. Get. Scoring a man ore the coxcomb is but a scratch with you:âo' your occupation, your scurvie scuffling trade: I was told before my face was bad enough; but now I look like bloody bone, and raw head, to fright children; I am for no use else. 2. Gu. Thou shalt fright men. 1. Gu. You look so terrible now: but see your face in the pummell of my sword. Get. I die, I am gone. Oh my sweet physiognomy. Enter 3 Persians. 2. Gu. They come. Now fight, or die indeed. Get. I will scape this way: I cannot hold my sword; What would you have of a maim'd man? 1. Gu. Nay, then I have a goad to prick you forward, Oxe. 2. Gu. Fight like a man, or die lie a dog. Get. Shall I, like Cesar fall among my friends? no mercy? Et tu Brute? You shall not have the honour of my death, I'll fall by the Enemie first. 1. Gu. O brave, brave Geta; Persians driven off. he plaies the divell now. Enter Niger. Nig. Make up for honour, the Persians shrink. The passage is laid open, great Dioclesian, like a second Mars, his strong arm govern'd by the fierce Bellona, performs more then a man: His shield struck full of Persian darts, which now are his defence against the Enemies swords, still leads the way. Of all the Persian Forces, one strong Squadron, Alarm's continued. in which Cosroe in his own person fights, stands firm, and yet unrouted: Break thorow that, the day, and all is ours. Retreat. All. Victory, Victory. Exeunt. Flourish. ScÃ¦na Sexta. Enter (in Triumph with Roman Ensignes) Guard, Dioclesian, Charinus, Aurelia, Maximinian, Niger, Geta, Cosroe, Cassana, Persians (as Prisoners): Delphia, Drusilla, privately. Dio. I am rewarded in the Act: your freedome to me's ten thousand Triumphs: You Sir, share in all my Glories. And unkind Aurelia, from being a Captive, still command the Victor. Nephew, remember by whose gift you are free: You I afford my pitie; baser minds insult on the afflicted, You shall know, Vertue and Courage is admir'd and lov'd in Enemies: but more of that hereafter. Thanks to your valour; to your swords I owe this wreath triumphant. Nor be thou forgot my first poor bondman, Geta, I am glad thou art turn'd a fighter. Get. 'Twas against my will: but now I am content with't. Char. But imagine what honours can be done to you beyond these, transcending all example; 'tis in you to will, in us to serve it. Nig. Wee will have his Statue of pure gold set in the Capitol, and he that bows not to it as a god, makes forfeit of his head. Max. I burst with envie; and yet these honours, which conferr'd on me, would make me pace on air, seem not to move him. Dio. Suppose this done, or were it possible I could rise higher still, I am a man, and all these Glories, Empires heap'd upon me, confirm'd by constant friends, and faithfull Guards, cannot defend me from a shaking feaver, or bribe the uncorrupted dart of death to spare me one short minute. Thus adorn'd in these triumphant Robes, my body yeelds not a greater shadow then it did when I liv'd both poor, and obscure; a swords sharp point enters my flesh as far; dreams break my sleep as when I was a private man; my Passions are stronger tyrants on me; nor is Greatnesse a saving Antidote to keep me from, a traitors poyson. Shall I praise my fortune, or raise the building of my happinesse on her uncertain favour? or presume she is my owne, and sure, that yet was never constant to any? should my reason fail me (as flattery oft corrupts it) here's an example, to speak how far her smiles are to be trusted; The rising Sun, this morning, saw this man the Persian Monarch, and those Subjects proud that had the honour but to kisse his feet; and yet ere his diurnall progresse ends, hee is the scorn of Fortune: But you'll say, that shee forsook him for his want of courage, but never leaves the bold. Now by my hopes of peace and quiet here, I never met a braver Enemie: and to make it good, Cosroe, Cassana, and the rest, be free, and ransomlesse return. Cosr. To see this vertue is more to me then Empire; and to be orecome by you, a glorious victorie. Max. What a divell means he next? Dio. I know that Glory is like Alcides shirt, if it stay on us till pride hath mix'd it with our blood; nor can we part with it at pleasure: when wee would uncase, it brings along with it both flesh and sinews, and leaves us living monsters. Max. Would it were come to my turn to put it on: I'ld run the hazzard. Dio. No, I will not be pluck'd out by the ears out of this glorious castle; uncompell'd I will surrender rather: Let it suffice, I have touch'd the height of humane happinesse, and here I fix Nil ultra. Hitherto I have liv'd a servant to ambitious thoughts, and fading glories: what remains of life, I dedicate to Vertue; and to keep my faith untainted, farewell Pride and Pomp, and circumstance of glorious Majestie, farewell for ever. Nephew, I have noted, that you have long with sore eyes look'd upon my flourishing Fortune; you shall have possession of my felicitie: I deliver up my Empire, and this Jem I priz'd above it, and all things else that made me worth your envie, freely unto you. Gentle Sir, your suffrage, to strengthen this: the souldiers love I doubt not; his valour (Gentlemen) will deserve your favours, which let my prayers further. All is yours. But I have been too liberall, and giv'n that I must beg back again. Max. What am I falne from? Dio. Nay, start not: It is only the poor Grange, the Patrimony which my Father left me, I would be Tenant to. Max. Sir, I am yours: I will attend you there. Dio. No, keep the Court: seek you in Rome for honour: I will labour to finde content elswhere. Disswade me not, byâ, I am resolv'd. And now Drusilla, being as poor as when I vow'd to make thee my wife: if thy love since hath felt no change, I am ready to perform it. Dru. I still lov'd your Person, not your Fortunes: in a cottage, being yours, I am an Empresse. Del. And I'll make the change most happy. Dio. Do me then the honour, to see my vow perform'd. You but attend my Glories to the urn; where be it ashes, welcome my mean estate: and as a due, Wish Rest to me, I Honour unto you. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Chorus. Cho. The War with glory ended; and Cosroe (Acknowledging his fealtie to Charinus) Dismiss'd in peace, returns to Persia: The rest, arriving safely unto Rome, Are entertain'd with Triumphs: Maximinian, By the grace and intercession of his Uncle, Saluted CÃ¦sar: but good Dioclesian, Weary of Pomp and State, retires himself With a small Train, to a most private Grange In Lumbardie; where the glad Countrey strives With Rurall Sports to give him entertainment: With which delighted, he with ease forgets All specious trifles, and securely tastes The certain pleasures of a private life. But oh Ambition, that eats into With venom'd teeth, true thankfulnesse, and honour. And to support her Greatnesse, fashions fears, Doubts, and preventions to decline all dangers, Which in the place of safetie, prove her ruine: All which be pleas'd to see in Maximinian, To whom, his confer'd Soveraignty was like A large sail fill'd full with a fore-right winde, That drowns a smaller Bark: and hee once faln Into ingratitude, makes no stop in mischief, But violently runs on. Allow Maximinian all, Honour, and Empire, absolute command; Yet being ill, long great he cannot stand. Exit. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Maximinian and Aurelia. Aur. Why droops my Lord, my Love, my life, my CÃ¦sar? how ill this dulnesse doth comport with Greatnesse? Does not (with open arms) your Fortune court you? Rome know you for her Master? I my self confesse you for my Husband? love, and serve you? if you contemn not these, and think them curses, I know no blessings that ambitious flesh could wish to feel beyond 'em. Max. Best Aurelia, the parent and the nurse to all my Glories, 'tis not that thus embracing you, I think there is a heaven beyond it, that begets these sad retirements; but the fear to lose what it is hell to part with: better to have liv'd poor and obscure, and never scal'd the top of hilly Empire, then to die with fear to be thrown headlong down, almost as soon as we have reach'd it. Aur. These are Pannick terrours you fashion to your self: Is not my Brother (your equall and copartner in the Empire) vow'd and confirm'd your friend? the souldier constant? Hath not your Uncle Dioclesian taken his last farewell o'th' world? What then can shake ye? Max. The thought I may be shaken: and assurance that what we doe possesse is not our own, but has depending on anothers favour: for nothing's more uncertain (my Aurelia) then Power that stands not on his proper Basis, but borrowes his foundation. I'll make plain my cause of doubts and fears; for what should I conceal from you, that are to be familiar with my most private thoughts? Is not the Empire my Uncles gift? and may he not resume it upon the least distaste? Does not Charinus crosse me in my designes? And what is Majestie when 'tis divided? Does not the insolent Souldier call my command his donative? and what can take more from our honour? No (my wise Aurelia,) If I to you am more then all the world, as sure you are to me; as wee desire to be secure, wee must be absolute, and know no equall: when your Brother borrows the little splendor that he has from us, and we are serv'd for fear, not at entreaty, we may live safe; but till then, we but walk with heavie burthens on a sea of glasse, and our own weight will sink us. Aur. Your Mother brought you into the world an Emperor: you perswade but what I would have counsell'd: Neernesse of blood, respect of pietie, and thankfulnesse, and all the holy dreams of vertuous fools must vanish into nothing, when Ambition (the maker of great minds, and nurse of honour) puts in for Empire. On then, and forget your simple Uncle; think he was the Master (in being once an Emperor) of a Jewell, whose worth and use he knew not: For Charinus, no more my Brother, if hee be a stop to what you purpose; hee to Me's a stranger, and so to be remov'd. Max. Thou more then woman, thou masculine Greatnesse, to whose soaring spirit to touch the stars seems but an easie flight; O how I glory in thee! those great women Antiquitie is proud of, thou but nam'd, shall be no more remembred: but persever, and thou shalt shine among those lesser lights Enter Charinus, Niger, Guard. to all posteritie like another Phebe, and so ador'd as she is. Aur. Here's Charinus, his brow furrow'd with anger. Max. Let him storm, and you shall hear me thunder. Cha. He dispose of my Provinces at his pleasure? and confer those honours (that are onely mine to give) upon his creatures? Nig. Mighty Sir, ascribe it to his assurance of your love and favour, and not to pride or malice. Cha. No, good Niger, courtesie shall not fool me; he shall know I lent a hand to raise him, and defend him, while he continues good: but the same strength if pride make him usurp upon my Right, shall strike him to the Center. You are well met, Sir. Max. As you make the Encounter: Sir, I hear, that you repine, and hold your self much griev'd, in that, without your good leave, I bestow'd the Gallian Proconsulship upon a follower of mine. Cha. 'Tis true: and wonder you durst attempt it. Max. Durst, Charinus? Cha. Durst: again, I speak it: Think you me so tame, so leaden and unactive, to sit down with such dishonour? But, recall your grant, and speedily; or by the Romanâ thou tripst thine own heels up, and hast no part in Rome, or in the Empire. Max. Thou hast none, but by permission: Alas, poor Charinus, thou shadow of an Emperor, I scorn thee, thee, and thy foolish threats: The gods appoint him the absolute disposer of the Earth, that has the sharpest sword. I am sure (Charinus) thou wear'st one without edge. When cruell Aper had kill'd Numerianus, thy Brother, (an act that would have made a trembling coward more daring then Alcides) thy base feare made thee wink at it: then rose up my Uncle (for the honour of the Empire, and of Rome) against the Traitor, and among his Guards punish'd the treason: This bold daring act got him the Souldiers suffrages to be CÃ¦sar. And howsoever his too gentle nature allow'd thee the name only, as his gift, I challenge the succession. Cha. Thou art cozen'd. When the receiver of a courtesie cannot sustain the weight it carries with it, 'tis but a Triall, not a present Act. Thou hast in a few dayes of thy short Reign, in over-weening pride, riot and lusts, sham'd noble Dioclesian, and his gift: nor doubt I, when it shall arrive unto his certain knowledge, how the Empire grones under thy Tyranny, but hee will forsake his private life, and once again resume his laid-by Majestie: or at least, make choice of such an Atlas as may bear this burthen, too heavie for thy shouldiers. To effect this, lend your assistance (Gentlemen) and then doubt not but that this mushroom (sprung up in a night) shall as soon wither. And for you (Aurelia) if you esteem your honour more then tribute paid to your lothsome appetite, as a Furie flie from his loose embraces: so farewell; ere long you shall hear more. Exeunt. Aur. Are you struck dumb, that you make no reply? Max. Sweet, I will doe, and after talk: I will prevent their plots. and turn them on their own accursed heads. My Uncle? good: I must not know the names of Pietie or Pitie. Steel my heart, desire of Empire, and instruct me, that the Prince that over others would bear sway, checks at no Let that stops him in his way. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter three Shepherds, and two Countrymen. 1 Sh. Do you think this great man will continue here? 2 Sh. Continue here? what else? hee has bought the great Farme; a great man, with a great Inheritance, and all the ground about it, all the woods too; and stock'd it like an Emperor. Now, all our sports again and all our merry Gambols, our May-Ladies, our evening-daunces on the Green, our Songs, our Holliday good cheer, our Bag-pipes now Boyes, shall make the wanton Lasses skip again, our Sheep-shearings, and all our knacks. 3 Sh. But heark ye, we must not call him Emperor. 1 Countr. That's all one; he is the king of good fellowes, that's no treason; and so I'll call him still, though I be hang'd for't. I grant ye, he has given his honour to another man, he cannot give his humour: he is a brave fellow, and will love us, and we'll love him. Come hither Ladon, what new Songs, and what geers? 3 Sh. Enough: I'll tell ye he comes abroad anon to view his grounds, and with the help of Thirsis, and old Egon, (if his whorson could be gon) &amp; Amaryllis, and some few more o'th wenches, we will meet him, and strike him such new Springs, and such free welcoms, shall make him scorn an Empire, forget Majestie, and make him blesse the hour he liv'd here happy. 2 Countr. And we will second ye, we honest Carters, we lads o'th' lash, with some blunt entertainment, our Teams to two pence, will give him some content, or wee'll bawl fearfully. 3 Sh. Hee cannot expect now his Courtly entertainments, and his rare Musicks, and Ladies to delight him with their voyces; honest and cheerfull toyes from honest meanings, and the best hearts they have. We must be neat all: on goes my russet jerkin with blue buttons. 1 Sh. And my green slops I was married in; my bonnet with my carnation point with silver tags, boyes: You know where I won it. 1 Countr. Thou wilt nere be old, Alexis, 1 Sh. And I shall find some toyes that have been favors, and nose-gayes, and such knacks: for there be wenches. 3 Sh. My mantle goes on too I plaid young Paris in, and the new garters Amaryllis sent me. 1 Coun. Yes, yes: we'll all be handsom, and wash our faces. Neighbour, I see a remnant of March dust that's hatch'd into your chaps: I pray ye be carefull. Enter Geta. and mundifie your muzzell. 2. Countr. I'll to th'Barbers, It shall cost me I know what. Who's this? 3. Sh. Give room, neighbours, a great man in our State: gods blesse your Worship. 2. Countr. Encrease your Mastership. Get. Thanks, my good people: Stand off, and know your duties: as I take it you are the labouring people of this village, and you that keep the sheep. Stand farther off yet, and mingle not with my Authoritie, I am too mighty for your companie. 3. Sh. we know it Sir; and we desire your Worship to reckon us amongst your humble servants, and that our Country Sports, Sir,â Get. For your Sports, Sir, they may be seen, when I shall think convenient, when out of my discretion, I shall view 'em, and hold 'em fit for licence. Ye look upon me, and look upon me seriously, as ye knew me: 'Tis true, I have been a Rascall, as you are, a fellow of no mention, nor no mark, just such another piece of durt, so fashion'd: But Time, that purifies all things of merit, has set another stamp. Come neerer now, and be not fearfull; I take off my austeritie: and know me for the great and mighty Steward under this man of Honour: know ye for my vassals, and at my pleasure; I can dispeople ye, can blow you and your cattell out o'th' Countrey: but fear me, and have favour. Come, go along with me, and I will hear your Songs, and perhaps like 'em. 3. Sh. I hope you will, Sir. Get. 'Tis not a thing impossible. Perhaps I'll sing my self, the more to grace ye and if I like your women. 3. Sh. We'll have the best, Sir. handsom young Girls. Get. The handsomer, the better. Enter Delphia. 'May bring your wives too, 'twill be all one charge to ye; for I must know your Families. Del. 'Tis well said, 'tis well said, honest friends; I know ye are hatching some pleasurable sports for your great Landlord: fill him with joy, and win him a friend to ye, and make this little Grange seem a large Empire, let out with home-contents: I'll work his favour, which daily shall be on ye. 3. Sh. Then we'll sing daily, and make him the best Sports. Del. Instruct 'em Geta, and be a merry man again. Get. Will ye lend me a divell, that we may daunce awhile? Del. I'll lend thee two. and Bag-pipes that shall blow alone. Get. I thank ye: but I'll know your divels of a cooler complexion first. Come, follow, follow; I'll go sit and see ye. Exeunt. Enter Diocles, and Drusilla. Dell. Do; and be ready an hour hence, and bring 'em; for in the Grove you'll find him. Dio. Come Drusilla, the partner of my best contents: I hope now you dare beleeve me. Dru. Yes, and dare say to ye, I think ye now most happie. Dio. You say true (Sweet) for by myâ, I find now by experience, Content was never Courtier. Dru. I pray ye walk on, Sir; the cool shades of the Grove invite ye. Dio. O my Deerest! When man has cast off his ambitious Greatnesse, and sunk into the sweetnesse of himself; built his foundation upon honest thoughts, not great, but good Desires him daily servants; how quietly he sleeps! how joyfully he wakes again, and looks on his possessions, and from his willing labours feeds with pleasure? Here hangs no Comets in the shapes of Crowns, to shake our sweet contents: nor here, Drusilla, Cares, like Eclipses, darken our endeavours: we love here without rivals, kisse with innocence; our thoughts as gentle as our lips; our children the double heirs both of our forms and faiths. Dru. I am glad ye make this right use of this sweetnesse, this sweet retirednesse. Dio. 'T is sweet indeed (love) and every circumstance about it, shews it. How liberal is the spring in every place here? the artificial Court shews but a shadow, a painted imitation of this glory. Smell to this flower, here Nature has her excellence: let all the perfumes of the Empire passe this, the carefull'st Ladies cheek shew such a colour, they are gilded and adulterate vanities. And here in Povertie dwells noble Nature. What pains we take to cool our wines, to allay us, Musick belowe. and bury quick the fuming god to quench us, methinks this Crystal Well? Ha! what strange musick? 'tis underneath, sure: how it stirs and joys me? how all the birds set on? the fields redouble their odoriferous sweets? Heark how the ecc hoesâ Enter a Spirit from the Well. Drus. See, Sir, those flowers from out the Well, spring to your entertainment. Enter Delphia. Dio. Blesse me. Dru. Be not afraid, 't is some good Angel that 's come to welcom ye. Del. Go neer and hear, son. Song. Dio. O mother, thank ye, thank ye, this was your will. Del. You shall not want delights to blesse your presence. Now ye are honest, all the Stars shall honour ye. Enter shepherds and dancers. Stay, here are Countrey-shepherds; here is some sport too, and you must grace it, Sir; 't was meant to welcom ye; a King shall never feel your joy. Sit down, son. A dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses; Pan leading the men, Ceres the maids. Hold, hold, my Messenger appears: leave off, friends, leave off a while, and breathe. Dio. What news? ye are pale, mother. Del. No, I am careful of thy safety (son) be not affrighted, but sit still; I am with thee. Enter Maximinian, Aurelia, Souldiers. And now dance out your dance. Do you know that person. Be not amaz'd, but let him shew his dreadfullest. Max. How confident he sits amongst his pleasures, and what a chearful colour shews in's face, and yet he sees me too, the Souldiers with me. Aur. Be speedie in your work, (you will be stopt else) and then you are an Emperour. Max. I will about it. Dio. My Royal Cousin, how I joy to see ye, you, and your Royal Empresse. Max. You are too kinde, Sir. I come not to eat with ye, and to surfeit in these poor Clownish pleasures; but to tell ye I look upon ye like my Winding-sheet, the Coffin of my Greatnesse, my, my Grave: for whilst you are aliveâ Dio. Alive, my Cousin? Max. I say, Alive. I am no Emperour; I am nothing but mine own disquiet. Dio. Stay, Sir. Max. I cannot stay. The Souldiers doat upon ye. I would fain spare ye; but mine own securitie compels me to forget you are my Uncle, compels me to forget you made me CÃ¦sar: for whilst you are remembred, I am buried. Dio. Did not I make ye Emperour, dear Cousin, the free gift from my special grace? Del. Fear nothing. Dio. Did not I chuse this povertie, to raise you? that Royal woman gave into your arms too? bless'd ye with her bright beautie? gave the souldier, the souldier that hung to me, fix'd him on ye? gave ye the worlds command? Max. This cannot help ye. Dio. Yet this shall ease me. Can ye be so base (Cousin) so far from Noblenesse, so far from nature, as to forget all this? to tread this Tie out? raise to yourself so foul a monument that every common foot shall kick asunder? must my blood glue ye to your peace? Max. It must, Uncle; I stand too loose else, and my foot too feeble: you gone once, and their love retir'd, I am rooted. Dio. And cannot this removed poor state obscure me? I do not seek for yours, nor enquire ambitiously after your growing Fortunes. Take heed, my kinsman, ungratefulnesse and blood mingled together, will, like two furious Tidesâ Max. I must sail thorow 'em: let 'em be Tides of death, Sir, I must stem up. Dio. Hear but this last, and wisely yet consider: Place round about my Grange a Garison, that if I offer to exceed my limits, or ever in my common talk name Emperour, ever converse with any greedie souldier, or look for adoration, nay, for courtesie above the days salute.âThink who has fed ye, think (Cousin) who I am. Do ye slight my misery? Nay, then I charge thee; nay, I meet thy crueltie. Max. This cannot serve; prepare: Now fall on, souldiers, and all the treasure that I have. Thunder and Lightning. Sould. The earth shakes; we totter up and down; we cannot stand, Sir; me thinks the mountains tremble too. 2 Sould. The flashes how thick and hot they come? we shall be burn'd all. Del. Fall on, Souldiers: you that sell innocent blood, fall on full bravely. Sould. We cannot stir. Del. You have your libertie, so have you, Lady. One of you come do it. A hand with a Bolt appears above. Do you stand amaz'd? Look ore thy head, Maximinian, look, to thy terrour, what over-hangs thee: nay, it will nail thee dead; look how it threatens thee: the Bolt for vengeance on ungrateful wretches; the Bolt of innocent blood: read those hot characters, and spell the will of heaven. Nay, lovely Lady, you must take part too, as spur to ambition. Are ye humble? Now speak; my part's ended. Does all your glory shake? Max. Hear us, great Uncle, good and great Sir, be pitiful unto us: belowe your feet we lay our lives: be merciful: begin you, heaven will follow. Aur. Oh, it shakes still. Max. And dreadfully it threatens. We acknowledge our base and foul intentions. Stand between us; for faults confess'd, they say, are half forgiven. We are sorry for our sins. Take from us, Sir, that glorious weight that made us swell, that poison'd us; that masse of Majestie I laboured under, (too heavie and too mighty for my manage) that my poor innocent days may turn again, and my minde, pure, may purge me of these curses; by your old love, the blood that runs between us. The hand taken in. Aur. By that love once ye bare to me, by that Sir, that blessed maid enjoysâ Dio. Rise up, dear Cousin, and be your words your judges: I forgive ye: great as ye are, enjoy that greatnesse ever, whilst I mine own Content make mine own Empire. Once more I give ye all; learn to deserve it, and live to love your Good more then your Greatnesse. Now shew your loves to entertain this Emperour, my honest neighbours. Geta, see all handsom. Your Grace must pardon us, our house is little; but such an ample welcom as a poor man and his true love can make you and your Empresse. Madam, we have no dainties. Aur. 'Tis enough, Sir; we shall enjoy the riches of your goodnesse. Sould. Long live the good and gracious Dioclesian. Dio. I thank ye, Souldiers, I forgive your rashnesse. And Royal Sir, long may they love and honour ye. Drums march afar off. What Drums are those? Del. Meet 'em, my honest son, they are thy friends, Charinus and the old Souldiers that come to rescue thee from thy hot Cousin. But all is well, and turn all into welcoms: two Emperours you must entertain now. Dio. O dear mother, I have will enough, but I want room and glory. Del. That shall be my care. Sound your pipes now merrily. and all your handsom sports. Sing 'em full welcoms. Dio. And let 'em know, our true love breeds more stories and perfect joys, then Kings do, and their glories. Exeunt.
