      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A distant View of the Sea Coast near Carthagena, with hills, &amp;c.âon one side of the stage is the Governor's Castle. Enter Hierro de Brazo, or, Iron Arm, and Diego an attendant ruffianâthe former disguised in a long Spanish cloak. AIRâDIEGO. Bold Iron Arm why this disguise? Why venture near yon Castle Walls? Thought broods terrific in those eyes! And every gesture wild appalls! The jingling of bells are heard at a distance, and on the hills Mules appear loaden with richesâ Iron Arm points to them, intimating they must be hisâthe other seems to understand him, and proceeds: YesâI the daring scheme divine, Yon coming riches must be thine! They retireâthe jingling of bells again commencing, the Mules approach nearer, guarded by Soldiers, &amp;c. and, lead by Alphonso, several Inhabitants enter, and greet them with the following CHORUS. Jingling gay the sportive bells, See the loaded train appear! With joy the recoe's The Muleteer. bosom swells, As his journeys end draws near! The Governor, Guards, Victoria, Inis, and Females enter from the Castle, all delighted with the safe arrival of the treasureâthe Governor, after embracing him, presents Alphonso to Victoria, whose hand he kissesâthe chorus continues: Arriv'd safe our treasure, We'll dance, sing and play; While in safety with pleasure, 'Tis stow'd safe away! During this Iron Arm returns, and views the golden bars as they are conveyed into the Castle with satisfaction, determining to possess themâ Father Dominic enters from the Castle; Alphonso approaches him with presents; which receiving, he places himself between Alphonso and Victoria, and, taking their hands, presents them to the Governor. AIRâDOMINIC. To the Saint who protects us (while grateful you feel) From our British invaders, those lords of the Seas! Affection long tried, let your sanction now seal, Reward the brave youth who thus bids wealth encrease! The Governor joins their hands, giving them his blessingâInis and Sancho (a Soldier) come forward. RECITATIVEâINIS. La! ma'am, don't blushâI wish I was in your place, Sancho and I my lord (he bowing aukwardly, and she curtsying) would just ask whether When Father Dominic o'er them says grace, You'll let him tack their man and maid together. Governor stamps angrily, and they exeunt sheepishly âthe Muleteers and Spanish girls congratulate their mistress on her approaching Nuptials in an appropriate Dance, with Castanets, which when concluded, the alarm bell is sounded, and Inis and Sancho rush on out of breath, followed by Spanish Soldiers. DIALOGUE CATCH. Inis. The terror of Spain, dear! dear me! how I quake. San. We're ruin'd! invadedâ All. âWhat, what shall we do! The Englishâour Enemyâled on by Drake. ANOTHER PARTY. The fleet of the British approachâare in view! Drum beats, &amp;c. all appear in alarm and consternation âAlphonso summons the Soldiers from the Garrison, and the Governor attempts to lead them to meet the enemyâat the report of distant firing they are panic struck and fly, but are rallied by Alphonso, who again leads them to the attack, a second discharge of musquetry, more alarmed, they refuse to march; Iron Arm, muffled in his cloak displays the following scroll: âPardon Iron Arm, his Aid will Render Carthagena invincible.â Governor reads it with attentionâduring which Iron Arm discovers himself aside to Dominic, presenting him a purse, commanding him to plead in his behalf, or (shewing a dagger) threatens death as the consequence, and retires.âGovernor consults Dominic and Alphonsoâthe former recommends acquiescence with Iron Arm's requestâthe latter the contraryâIron Arm, viewing this from the entrance, vows eternal vengeance on Alphonso, and exit.â Enter Spanish officer and Soldiers with Oxenham, and other British Seamen prisoners. RECITATIVEâSPANISH OFFICER. Lord Governor, this boat's crew in the bay In taking soundings we surpriz'd. Span. âHuzza! The Governor requests Dominic to examine Oxenham âhe stalks up to him pompously. RECITATIVE. Dom. What is your force?âCommander?âcome friendâspeak? (Dominic offers him the purse he had received from Iron Arm, which Oxenham hurls away with disdain.) Oxen. I shan'tâold swabâso try some other tack, Dom. (Enrag'd) Torture this stubborn fortitude shall break; Oxen. Old Quizâthere's all you'll ever get from Jack. (Takes his quid from his mouth, and throws it at him.) Dom. In separate dungeons let them mourn their fate, Soon to some tune your spirit shall submit! Vindictive Spain on you will vengeance sate! Oxen. Then I'll sing, fal de ral tit. The Prisoners are guarded offâOxenham singing, âTit fal de ra, &amp;c.ââGovernor, &amp;c. ENTER the Castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. The Outside of a Prison, with practicable door, and grated window. Enter Iron Armâwhistles, two of his horde enterâhe dispatches them different routs, telling them he will go to their Cave and refresh himself with sleep; looks at the prison bars with disdain, and exit.âEnter Sancho and Soldiers, marching on Oxenham prisonerâInis meeting them. RECITATIVEâINIS. That's the brave Englishman! oh, dear a me! I must indulge my curiosity! Sanchoâere in yon jail for life-time you'd be cramming him, For Hispaniola's sake let me examine him! Indulge meâand of bribes I'll give a surplus, There (kisses him) and this flask which I have stolen on purpose. (gives him a flask.) DUETâINIS AND OXENHAM. [1.] Inis. Tell me truly (if it suit ye) When Drake lands what will he dare do? Oxen. Pretty beauty, do his duty, Conquer first, then nobly spare you. Inis. Lord! we've heard he is so daring, Cutting, slashing, storming, swearing; Neither man nor woman sparing. Oxen. âNo, no, no! Inis. But we've Soldiers, Sailors plenty, That your Captain's crew out numbers. Oxen. Damme! give us one to twenty, And we'll soon disturb their slumbers; Drub your Soldiers, sink your Sailors, Make as many quake and quail as The Devil did among the Tailors. Yeo, yeo, yeo! 2. Oxen. Pretty Donna, 'pon your honour, Can you like a British lover? Inis. What do sighs mean?âwhat one's eyes mean? If you've sense you'll soon discover! Oxen. Yeo, ho! avast! your's sparkle finely, Like diamonds glittering love so kindly; Damme! but you look divinely, Inis. (conceitedly) âNo, no, no! But we've Soldiers, &amp;c. Enter Officer, blames Sancho for not having secured his prisonerâa Gaoler from the Prison hurries him into the jail, and the Officer, marching the other Soldiers off, leaves Sancho as centinelâafter Sancho has paced a few times backwards and forwards, occasionally imbibing comfort from his bottle, Oxenham looks through the grate. RECITATIVEâOXENHAM. So here I'm harbour'dânot much to my mind, I say old boy! this cabin's cursed confin'd. (Sancho nods and drinks to him.) Aye pull awayâI'm set here in the bilboes! (He tries the strength of the iron barsâshakes his head âpulls out a clasp knife, which he opens.) Avast! if this knife now was but a saw! How I wouldâ(Strikes it against the grating.) âUmphâzounds as I shake my elbows! I'll drown the noise by tipping him slack jaw. Aye, drink awayâat it here goes ding dong. (Sancho drinks during this soliloquy.) I say, old toper! will you have a song? Sancho surlily repliesâayeâ He begins sawing and singing, the Centinel acting what he sings. SONGâOXENHAM, Tune Bembow. As honest a Seaman as honest can be, By the foe was imprison'd all in Barbary; Where a barbarous Blackamoor whom Christian souls must hate, Made him work like a Neger Boy as he look'd through his grate. TuneâBlack-eyed Susan. All as he work'd, he sometimes sigh'd, Dropping salt tears at every wish! While his old Guard, the bottle ply'd, And drank his flip like any fish! But still the Moor his keen revenge to sate, Made him work harder at the Dungeon's grate. Sancho, having now got considerably inebriated, staggering round, nearly detects him. TuneâPoor Jack. Drink on, says the Sailor! for sorrow's a dry, With tears I've replenish'd my cup; So the old soul he swigg'd it 'till, piping his eye, He nearly had swigg'd his last sup! So he stagger'd and hiccup'd, and swell'd in great state! On the Prisoner's grief turn'd his back; Who found a sweet cherub who open'd his grate, And freedom restored to Poor Jack! At this period Sancho, overcome with liquor, staggers against the Prison, his back towards Oxenham, and his musquet within his reachâOxenham having, during the above air, by sawing, at length loosened the grating, cautiously takes it out, and, snatching Sancho's musquet from him, gently shoves him down with the but end, and makes his escapeâ the Jailor appears at the window, awakes Sancho, and making him sensible of their loss, they exeunt in the utmost trepidation;âIron Arm's ruffians re-enter, and complain of the little prospect they have of obtaining plunder; but perceiving Alphonso, &amp;c. approaching, retireâAlphonso enters, leading on Victoria, followed by Inisâthe Ruffians fix on their prey, one seizes Victoria, the other Inisâ Victoria is rescued by Alphonso, but Inis borne off by the Ruffians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DUETâINIS AND OXENHAM. [1.] Inis. Tell me truly (if it suit ye) When Drake lands what will he dare do? Oxen. Pretty beauty, do his duty, Conquer first, then nobly spare you. Inis. Lord! we've heard he is so daring, Cutting, slashing, storming, swearing; Neither man nor woman sparing. Oxen. âNo, no, no!

Yeo, ho! avast! your's sparkle finely, Like diamonds glittering love so kindly; Damme! but you look divinely, Inis. (conceitedly) âNo, no, no! But we've Soldiers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. A Romantic View, with entrance into Iron Arm's Caveâa wild bridge over a waterfall. Enter Carlos and Diego, at different entrances; the former, much elated, is on the point of putting his whistle to his mouth, when Diego stops him. DIALOGUE SONG. Diego. 'Ere our Captain we rouze with our whistle so shrill, Honest comrade I prythee impart! What plunder thou'st ta'en, for the night has been still, And what victim thou'st stabb'd to the heart? Carlos. The blade of my poignard's uncrimson'd with blood, Though I prowl'd long with murderous views! But while near the Castle I listening stood, My ears drank in heart chearing news! Displays a scroll on which is written: âPardon to Iron Arm and his Confederates, on condition they join the Governor to repel the English.â They read it with great exultation, and whistleâ Iron Arm appears on the bridge, asks them what successâthey shew him the scrollâhe leaps exultingly among them, and reads it with great rapidity âafter some deliberation, whistles for his band, they join him from different partsâafter having drawn them up in a line, he places himself at their head; and, having given orders to close the entrance to their cave, &amp;c. marches, elated, his band over the bridge, and exeunt.âRuffians enter, bearing on Inis; she kneels to them soliciting mercyâthey are hurrying her towards the Cave, when Oxenham enters, attacks and vanquishes themâInis making her escape, and Oxenham following up the Ruffiansâhe returns fatigued with his struggle. RECITATIVEâOXENHAM. Zounds! 'twas tough work! I'll just dash off the spray! (Calling after Inis.) Yeo ho!âavast!âhow trim she scuds away! Where can our Admiral and crew be loitering! Damme! they hobbled me in reconnoitring! Would I could run where Drake his course now shapes, But zounds! I'm always running into scrapes!â SONG. [1.] Bound 'prentice to a Waterman I larn'd a bit to row, But bless your heart I always was so gay; That to treat a little Water-nymph that took my heart in tow, I runn'd myself a bit in debt, and then I runn'd away. Singing ri tol, fol de rol, yeo ho! Ri tol, fol de riddle do! 2. 'Board man of war I enter'd next, and larn'd to quaff good flip, And far from home we scudded on so gay; I runn'd my rigs, but liked so well my Captain, Crew, and Ship, That run what will, why damme! if I ever run away. Singing, &amp;c. 3. With Drake I've sail'd the World around, and learnt a bit to fight, But somehow I a prisoner was ta'en! So when the Spanish Jailor to my dungeon shew'd a light, I blinded just his peepers, and then runn'd away again! Singing ri tol, fol de rol, &amp;c. 4. I've runn'd a many risques in life, on Ocean and on Shore, But always like a Briton got the day; And fighting in Old England's cause, will run as many more, But let me face ten thousand foes, will never run away. Singing, &amp;c. Exit.</field>

What plunder thou'st ta'en, for the night has been still, And what victim thou'st stabb'd to the heart? Carlos.
