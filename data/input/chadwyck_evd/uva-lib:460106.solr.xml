      <field name="fulltext">Acted at the Roman Sports, Donatus says “At the Megalesian Games:” but he is certainly wrong. For this Comedy was played after the Eunuch had been brought on the stage, though in the very same year; it could not consequently be at the same festival on which the Eunuch was played, but some succeeding one. The Megalesian Games happened in April, and the Roman Sports in the month of September. Dacier. L. Postumius Albinus, and L. Cornelius Merula, Curule Ædiles: Principal Actors L. Ambivius Turpio and L. Attilius Prænestinus: The Musick, composed for Unequal Flutes, by Flaccus, Freedman to Claudius: Taken entirely from the Epidicazomenos of Apollodorus: Facta Quarto. The words quarto and quartùm have afforded matter of much dispute. When Pompey was just about to consecrate the Temple of Victory, a difficulty arose how he should express his third Consulship? whether it ought to be Consul tertio, or Consul tertium? The learned men of Rome were divided in their opinions about it, and even Cicero left the question undecided; for in order to satisfy all parties, he directed it should be thus abbreviated, Consul tert. Facta quarto here can mean nothing else but that the Phormio was acted four times in one year, to distinguish its merit; and not, as Donatus interprets, that it was Terence's fourth play in order of Composition.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. The Old Bard Luscius Lavinius, the same mentioned in former prologues. finding it impossible To draw our Poet from the love of verse, And bury him in indolence, attempts By calumny to scare him from the stage; Pretending, that in all his former plays The characters are low, and mean the stile; Tenui esse oratione, &amp; scripturâ levi. The Poet here shews the want of judgement in the censures of the Critick, who objects to him as a fault, what ought to be the chief excellence of comick stile. It is true indeed that Terence was in this instance held inferior to Menander; and condemned for using less sublime language than his original: from which censure he here endeavours to vindicate himself by saying, that such a raised stile rather belonged to the province of Tragedy. Donatus. The opinion of Donatus on this passage is pretty clear from the above note: yet this line has created much dispute among commentators. The learned author of the Notes on the Art of Poetry almost directly contradicts Donatus, and says, “The sense of this passage is not, as commentators have idly thought, that his style was low and trifling, for this could never be pretended, but that his dialogue was insipid, and his characters, and in general his whole composition, WITHOUT THAT COMICK HEIGHTENING, which their vitiated tastes required.” Whoever consults the whole context, I think, must accede to the interpretation of Donatus, rather than that of the Annotator upon Horace. The objection of Lavinius to the plays of Terence was not, that they were without that comick heightening, &amp;c. but, that the Poet did not aspire to the Tragick Sublime. The next line puts it beyond doubt. Because he ne'er described, &amp;c. all which circumstances, says Donatus, are tragical, and would be vicious in Comedy. In a note to the prologue to the Andrian on the lines Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen Dissimili oratione sunt factæ, ac stilo. Donatus gives this explanation. Orationem in sententiis dicunt esse, stilum in verbis, argumentum in rebus.—“Oratio refers to the sentiments, stilus to the diction, and argumentum to the plot.” Agreeable to this interpretation I rendered that passage —In argument Less different, than in sentiment, and stile. But here the instance immediately subjoined seeming to point out the word Oratione as referring to Character, as Scriptura relates to the language, I have translated the verse according to that idea. Because he ne'er describ'd a mad-brain'd youth, This verse illustrates the foregoing; for here the Poet gives us a specimen of his rival's genius and taste. He was fond of introducing characters extravagant, unnatural, and overstrained: hence the language must be of a piece, impetuous, turbulent, full of rant and affectation. No wonder, therefore, if he could not relish the compositions of our poet, whose characters are drawn from nature, and the language suitably artless and simple. Patrick. Who in his fits of phrenzy thought he saw A Hind, the dogs in full cry after her; Her too imploring and beseeching him To give her aid.—But did he understand, That when the piece was first produc'd, it ow'd, More to the Actor, than himself, its safety, He would not be thus bold to give offence. —But if there's any one that says, or thinks, “That had not the Old Bard assail'd him first, “Our Poet could not have devis'd a Prologue, “Having no matter for abuse;”—let such Receive for answer, “that altho' the prize “To all advent'rers is held out in common, “The Veteran Poet meant to drive our Bard “From study into want: He therefore chose “To answer, though he would not first offend. “And had his adversary but have prov'd “A generous rival, he had had due praise; “Let him then bear these censures, and reflect, “Of his own slanders 'tis the due return. “But henceforth I shall cease to speak of him, “Altho' he ceases not himself to rail.” But now what I'd request of you, attend! To-day I bring a new Play, which the Greeks Call Epidicazomenos; A Greek word, [??????????????] signifying a person who demands justice of another; meaning Phormio, who is the Plaintiff in the Law-suit, which is the ground of the intrigue in this pleasant comedy. the Latins, From the chief character, name Phormio: Phormio, whom you will find a Parasite, And the chief engine of the plot.—And now, If to our Poet you are well inclin'd, Give ear; be favourable; and be silent! Let us not meet the same ill fortune now, Alluding, as is generally supposed, to the disturbances on the first attempts to represent The Step-Mother. That we before encounter'd, when our troop Was by a tumult driven from their place; To which the Actor's merit, seconded By your good-will and candour, has restor'd us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. DAVUS alone. Terence here follows the same method, that he persues in some other of his Comedies, of introducing a Protatick Personage, that is, a character foreign to the fable; that, while the story is opened to him, the audience may be informed of as much as is necessary for them to know. But although this scene is introduced merely for the instruction of the spectator, yet the Poet has contrived to season it with a great deal of wit and humour; and indeed that is the highest pitch of dramatick art, to seem to intend nothing but the amusement of the Spectator, and to carry on the plot, while you are actually endeavouring to prepare them for the incidents that are to follow. Donatus. I have already more than once delivered my opinion concerning the Protatick Personage. The scene before us is indeed most exquisitely beautiful, and so admirable a model of Narration, that it gives one pain to make the slightest objection to it. But I cannot help thinking that the Trinummus of Plautus, a comedy which has some similarity to this of our author, is opened with more art and vivacity. Davus is rather idly introduced, brings money to no end, and hears the story to no purpose. In the Andrian, Simo has some sort of excuse for opening the mystery of his conduct to Sofia, as he belongs to the family, and it was proposed to make use of his assistance. But Davus has so very little relation to the parties concerned, that we do not know whose servant he is; nor does he take any part in the succeeding events. In the Trinummus, on the contrary, an old gentleman, who thinks the conduct of his friend reprehensible, comes to chide him for his behaviour; and the person accused, in his own vindication, explains himself at once to his angry monitor and to the spectators. This character also is not merely introduced as a Protatick Personage, but acts afterwards in concert with his friend. Geta, my worthy friend and countryman, Amicus summus meus &amp; popularis Geta. Popularis properly signifies one of the same town; and though not born in it, a person who has been registered with the inhabitants. The very names Davus and Geta plainly prove they could not be countrymen in the strict sense and meaning of that word. Dacier. Came to me yesterday: For some time past I've ow'd him some small balance of account: This, he desir'd, I wou'd make up: I have; And brought it with me: For his master's Son, I am inform'd, has lately got a wife: So I suppose this sum is scrap'd together For a Bride-Gift. Alack, how hard it is, That he, who is already poor, should still Throw in his mite, to swell the rich man's heap! Quod ille unciatim, &amp;c. These verses are extremely fine and elaborate, and make an exact climax, almost every word, as Donatus has observed, having a considerable emphasis and energy; the touches are strong, forcible, and natural.—The images of poverty and distress are greatly heightened by the contrast which immediately follows. Dacier. What He scarce, ounce by ounce, from short allowance, Sorely defrauding his own appetite, E demenso suo. Demensum was a measure of corn containing, as is commonly supposed, four bushels, which was delivered out to the slaves monthly, as their allowance. Donatus. Has spar'd, poor wretch! shall She sweep all at once, Unheeding with what labour it was got. Geta, moreover, shall be struck for more; Ferietur alio munere. Here the familiar Latin phrase exactly answers to the English one. Another gift, when Madam's brought to bed;— Another too, when Master's Birth-day's kept, And they initiate him. Alluding to the custom of Initiation among the antients, of which there were several kinds. Madam Dacier supposes it to signify their being initiated in the grand mysteries of Ceres, which was commonly done, while they were yet very young. Patrick.—All this Mama Shall carry off, the Bantling her excuse. But is that Geta? SCENE II. Enter GETA. Get. at entering.] If a red-hair'd man Enquire for me— Dav. No more! he's here. Get. Oh, Davus! The very man that I was going after. Dav. Here, take this! [gives a purse.] 'tis all told: you'll find it right; The sum I ow'd you. Get. Honest, worthy Davus! I thank you for your punctuality. Dav. And well you may, as men and times go now: Things, by my troth, are come to such a pass, If a man pays you what he owes, you're much Beholden to him.—But, pray, why so sad? Get. I?—You can scarce imagine in what dread, What danger I am in. Dav. How so? Get. I'll tell you, So you will keep it secret. Dav. Away, fool! The man, whose faith in money you have tried, D'ye fear to trust with words?—And to what end Shou'd I deceive you? Get. List then! Dav. I'm all ear. Get. D'ye know our old man's elder brother, Chremes? Dav. Know him? ay sure. Get. You do?—And his son Phædria? Dav. As well as I know you. Get. It so fell out, Both the old men were forc'd to journey forth At the same season. He to Lemnos, our's Into Cilicia, to an old acquaintance Who had decoy'd the old curmudgeon thither By wheedling letters, almost promising Mountains of gold. Dav. To one that had so much, More than enough already? Get. Prithee, peace! Money's his passion. Dav. Oh, would I had been A man of fortune, I! Get. At their departure, The two old gentlemen appointed me A kind of governor to both their sons. Dav. A hard task, Geta! Get. Troth, I found it so. My angry Genius for my sins ordain'd it. The Antients had a persuasion, that each man had a Genius or Guardian Deity, and that when he fell into any misfortune, or was guilty of any crime, it was because his Genius had abandoned him. Patrick. At first I took upon me to oppose: In short, while I was trusty to th'old man, The young one made my shoulders answer for it. Dav. So I suppose: for what a foolish task To kick against the pricks! Adversum stimulum calces. To kick against the pricks.—Originally an old Greek proverb, ???? ?? ?????? ?????????.—???? ?????? ????? ????????.—So our Saviour (Acts, chap. ix. v. 5.) it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Westerhovius. Get. I then resolv'd To give them their own way in ev'ry thing. Dav. Ay, then you made your market. Scîsti uti foro. An allusion to merchants, who fix the price of commodities in proportion to the demand there is for them. Donatus. Get. Our young spark Play'd no mad pranks at first: But Phædria Got him immediately a Musick-Girl: Fond of her to distraction! She belong'd To a most avaricious sordid pimp; Nor had we aught to give;—th'old gentlemen Had taken care of That. Nought else remain'd, Except to feed his eyes, to follow her, To lead her out to school, Musick-schools, where the Slave-merchants sent their Girls to attain accomplishments, which might enhance their price. Cooke. and hand her home. We too, for lack of other business, gave Our time to Phædria. Opposite the school, Whither she went to take her lessons, stood Barbers shops in Athens and Rome were places of publick resort for conversation, much of the nature of our Coffee-houses. Patrick. A Barber's shop, wherein most commonly We waited her return. Hither one day Came a young man in tears: In Apollodorus this young man is no other than the Barber himself, who was just returned from cutting off the young woman's hair, which was one of the usual ceremonies of mourning among the Greeks. This circumstance Terence has judiciously altered, that he might not shock the Roman spectators with manners so very foreign to their own. Donatus. we were amaz'd, And ask'd the cause. Never (said he, and wept) Did I suppose the weight of poverty A load so sad, so insupportable, As it appear'd but now.—I saw but now, Not far from hence, a miserable virgin Lamenting her dead mother. The Poet has managed this part of the Narration with so much address, that we are not so much affected at the death of the mother, as at the distress of the beautiful virgin: especially as we find in the catastrophe, that the death of this woman gives the poet a better opportunity of establishing the general happiness. Donatus. Near the corpse She sat; nor friend, nor kindred, nor acquaintance, Except one poor old woman, was there near To aid the funeral. I pitied her: Her beauty too was exquisite.—In short He mov'd us all: And Antipho at once Cried, “Shall we go and visit her?”—“Why, ay, “I think so,” said the other, “let us go!” “Conduct us, if you please.”—We went, arriv'd, And saw her.—Beautiful she was indeed! More justly to be reckon'd so, for she Had no additions to set off her beauty. Her hair dishevell'd, barefoot, woe-be-gone, In tears, and miserably clad: that if The life and soul of beauty had not dwelt Within her very form, all these together Must have extinguish'd it.—The spark, possess'd Already with the Musick-Girl, just cried, “She's well enough.”—But our young gentleman— Dav. Fell, I suppose, in love. Get. In love indeed. But mark the end! Next day, away he goes To the old woman strait, beseeching her To let him have the girl:—“Not she indeed! “Nor was it like a gentleman, she said, “For him to think on't: She's a citizen, “An honest girl, and born of honest parents:— “If he wou'd marry her indeed, by law “He might do that; on no account, aught else.” —Our spark, distracted, knew not what to do: At once he long'd to marry her, at once Dreaded his absent father. Dav. Wou'd not He, Had he return'd, have giv'n consent? Get. To wed A girl of neither family nor fortune? Never. Dav. What then? Get. What then! There is a Parasite, One Phormio, a bold enterprising fellow, Who—all the Gods confound him!— Dav. What did He? Get. Gave us the following counsel.—“There's a law “That Orphan Girls shou'd wed their next of kin, “Which law obliges too their next of kin “To marry them.—I'll say, that you're her kinsman, “And sue a writ against you. I'll pretend “To be her father's friend, and bring the cause “Before the judges. Who her father was, “Her mother who, and how she's your relation, “All this sham evidence I'll forge; by which “The cause will turn entirely in my favour. “You shall disprove no tittle of the charge; “So I succeed.—Your father will return; “Prosecute Me;—what then?—The Girl's our own.” Dav. A pleasant piece of impudence! Get. It pleas'd Our spark at least: He put it into practice; Came into court; and he was cast; and married. Dav. How say you? Get. Just as you have heard. Dav. Oh Geta, What will become of you? Get. I don't know, faith. But only this I know, whate'er chance brings, I'll patiently endure. Dav. Why, that's well said, And like a man. Get. All my dependance is Upon myself. Dav. And that's the best. Get. I might Beg one indeed to intercede for me, Who may plead thus—“Nay, pardon him this once! “But if he fails again, I've not a word “To say for him.”—And well if he don't add, “When I go hence, e'en hang him!” Dav. What of him, Gentleman-Usher to the Musick-Girl? Quid Pædagogus ille. The servants who attended children to and from school were by the Greeks called Pedagogues. Socrates was satirically called the Pedagogue of Alcibiades: and Davus humourously applies this name to Phædria, who, as Geta had told him, attended the Girl to and from the Musick-school. Dacier. How goes He on? Get. So, so! Dav. He has not much To give perhaps. Get. Just nothing, but mere hope. Dav. His father too, is he returned? Get. Not yet. Dav. And your old man, when do you look for Him? Get. I don't know certainly: but I have heard That there's a letter from him come to port, Which I am going for. Dav. Wou'd you aught else With me, good Geta? Get. Nothing, but Farewell! [Exit Davus. Ho, Boy! what, nobody at home! [Enter Boy.] Take this, And give it Dorcium. Da hoc Dorcio.—Dorcio from Dorcium, the name of a woman, as Planesium, Glycerium. Donatus. [Gives the Purse, and Exit. SCENE III. ANTIPHO, PHÆDRIA. Ant. Is it come to this? My father, Phædria!—my best friend!—That I Shou'd tremble, when I think of his return! When, had I not been inconsiderate, I, as 'tis meet, might have expected him. Phæ. What now? Ant. Is that a question? And from You, Who know th'atrocious fault I have committed? Oh, that it ne'er had enter'd Phormio's mind To give such counsel! nor to urge me on, In the extravagance of blind desire, To this rash act, the source of my misfortunes! I shou'd not have possest her: that indeed Had made me wretched some few days.—But then This constant anguish had not torn my mind.— Phæ. I hear you. Ant. —while each moment I expect His coming to divorce me. Phæ. Other men, For lack of what they love, are miserable; Abundance is your grievance. You're too rich A lover, Antipho! For your condition Is to be wish'd and pray'd for. Now, by heaven, Might I, so long as you have done, enjoy My love, it were bought cheaply with my life. How hard my lot, unsatisfied, unblest! How happy your's, in full possession!—One Of lib'ral birth, ingenuous disposition, And honest fame, without expence, you've got: The wife, whom you desir'd!—in all things blest, But want the disposition to believe so. Had you, like me, a scoundrel-pimp to deal with, Then you'd perceive—But sure 'tis in our nature, Never to be contented. Ant. Now to Me, Phædria, 'tis You appear the happy man. Still quite at large, free to consider still, To keep, persue, or quit her: I, alas, Have so entangled and perplext myself, That I can neither keep, nor let her go. —What now? isn't that our Geta, whom I see Running this way?—'Tis he himself—Ah me! How do I fear what news he brings! SCENE IV. Enter at a distance GETA running. Get. Confusion! A quick thought, Geta, or you're quite undone, So many evils take you unprepar'd; Which I know neither how to shun, nor how To extricate myself: for this bold stroke Of our's can't long be hid. Ant. What's this confusion? Get. Then I have scarce a moment's time to think. My master is arriv'd. Ant. What mischief's that? Get. Who, when he shall have heard it, by what art Shall I appease his anger?—Shall I speak? 'Twill irritate him.—Hold my peace?—enrage him.— Defend myself?—Impossible! Purgem me? Laterem lavem.—Laterem lavare, “to wash a brick,” was a proverb, signifying to labour in vain.—Oh, wretch! Now for myself in pain, now Antipho Distracts my mind.—But him I pity most; For him I fear; 'tis he retains me here: For, were it not for him, I'd soon provide For my own safety—ay, and be reveng'd On the old greybeard—carry something off, And shew my master a light pair of heels. Ant. What scheme to rob and run away is this? Get. But where shall I find Antipho? where seek him? Phæ. He mentions you. Ant. I know not what, but doubt That he's the messenger of some ill news. Phæ. Have you your wits? Get. I'll home: he's chiefly there. Phæ. Let's call him back! Ant. Holo, you! stop! Get. Heyday! Authority enough, be who you will. Ant. Geta! Get. turning.] The very man I wish'd to meet! Ant. Tell us, what news?—in one word, if you can. Get. I'll do it. Ant. Speak! Get. This moment at the Port— Ant. My father? Get. Even so. Ant. Undone! Phæ. Heyday! Ant. What shall I do? Phæ. What say you? [to Geta. Get. That I've seen His father, Sir,—your Uncle. Ant. How shall I, Wretch that I am! oppose this sudden evil? Shou'd I be so unhappy, to be torn From thee, my Phanium, life's not worth my care. Get. Since that's the case then, Antipho, you ought To be the more upon your guard. Ant. Alas! I'm not myself. Get. But now you shou'd be most so, Antipho. For if your father shou'd discern your fear, He'll think you conscious of a fault. Phæ. That's true. Ant. I cannot help it, nor seem otherwise. Get. How wou'd you manage in worse difficulties? Ant. Since I'm not equal to bear this, to those I shou'd be more unequal. Get. This is nothing. Pooh, Phædria, let him go! why waste our time? I will be gone. [going. Phæ. And I. [going. Ant. Nay, prithee, stay! What if I shou'd dissemble?—Will that do? [endeavouring to assume another air. Get. Ridiculous! Ant. Nay, look at me! Will That Suffice? Get. Not it. Ant. Or this? Get. Almost. Ant. Or this? Get. Ay! now you've hit it. Do but stick to that; Answer him boldly; give him hit for dash, Nor let him bear you down with angry words. Ant. I understand you. Get. “Forc'd”—“against your will”— “By law”—“by sentence of the court”—d'ye take me? —But what old gentleman is that, I see At t'other end o'th'street? Ant. 'Tis he himself. I dare not face him. [going. Get. Ah, what is't you do? Where d'ye run, Antipho! Stay, stay, I say. Ant. I know myself and my offence too well: To you then I commend my life and love. [Exit. SCENE V. Manent PHÆDRIA, and GETA. Phæ. Geta, what now? Get. You shall be roundly chid; I soundly drubb'd; or I am much deceiv'd. —But what e'en now we counsell'd Antipho, It now behoves ourselves to practise, Phædria. Phæ. Talk not of what behoves, but say at once What you wou'd have me do. Get. Do you remember The plea, whereon you both agreed to rest, At your first vent'ring on this enterprize? “That Phormio's suit was just, sure, equitable, “Not to be controverted.”— Phæ. I remember. Get. Now then that plea! or, if it's possible, One better or more plausible. Phæ. I'll do't. Get. Do you attack him first! I'll lie in ambush, To re-inforce you, if you give ground. Phæ. Well. [they retire. SCENE VI. Enter DEMIPHO at another part of the Stage. Dem. How's this? A wife! what, Antipho! and ne'er Ask my consent?—nor my authority— Or, grant we pass authority, not dread My wrath at least?—To have no sense of shame? —Oh, impudence!—Oh, Geta, rare adviser! Get. Geta at last. Dem. What they will say to me, Or what excuse they will devise, I wonder. Get. Oh, we have settled that already: Think Of something else. Dem. Will he say this to me, —“Against my will I did it”—Forc'd by law”— —I hear you: I confess it. Get. Very well. Dem. But conscious of the fraud, without a word In answer or defence, to yield the cause Tamely to your opponents—did the law Force you to that too? Phæ. That's home. Get. Give me leave! I'll manage it. Dem. I know not what to do: This stroke has come so unawares upon me, Beyond all expectation, past belief. —I'm so enrag'd, I can't compose my mind To think upon it.—Wherefore ev'ry man, Quamobrem omnes, &amp;c. This passage is quoted by Tully in the third book of his Tusculan Questions, and the maxim contained in these lines was a favourite principle among the Stoicks. But I cannot help thinking that the introduction of it in this place has commonly been considered too seriously; and I have scarce any doubt but that Terence intended it as a stroke of character. Commentators, in general, are never so happy as when they light upon a sentence in a classick author, which they can extol as a lesson of sound morality: but in dramatick writings we are not merely to confine ourselves to the consideration of what is said, but who says it. Donatus, in his preface to this play, says “that it is founded on passions almost too high for Comedy; but that the Poet contrives to temper every circumstance by his art.” In the present instance, the old gentleman is indeed in a violent passion, but his anger is so managed throughout the scene, that it becomes truly comick: And Donatus very properly refers us to a similar passage in the Brothers, where Demea in like manner delivers moral precepts, which are in like manner turned into ridicule, and archly parodied by the impudent slave. When his affairs go on most swimmingly, Ev'n then it most behoves to arm himself Against the coming storm: loss, danger, exile, Returning ever let him look to meet; His son in fault, wife dead, or daughter sick— All common accidents, and may have happen'd; That nothing shou'd seem new or strange. But if Aught has fall'n out beyond his hopes, all that Let him account clear gain. Get. Oh, Phædria, 'Tis wonderful, how much a wiser man I am than my old master. My misfortunes I have consider'd well.—At his return Doom'd to grind ever in the mill, beat, chain'd, Or set to labour in the fields; of these Nothing will happen new. If aught falls out Beyond my hopes, all that I'll count clear gain. —But why delay t'accost th'old gentleman, And speak him fair at first? [Phædria goes forward. Dem. Methinks I see My nephew Phædria. Phæ. My good Uncle, welcome! Dem. Your servant!—But where's Antipho? Phæ. I'm glad To see you safe— Dem. Well, well!—But answer me. Phæ. He's well: hard by.—But have affairs turn'd out According to your wishes? Dem. Wou'd they had! Phæ. Why, what's the matter? Dem. What's the matter, Phædria? You've clapp'd up a fine marriage in my absence. Phæ. What! are you angry with him about That? Get. Well counterfeited! Dem. Shou'd I not be angry? Let me but set eyes on him, he shall know That his offences have converted me From a mild father to a most severe one. Phæ. He has done nothing, Uncle, to offend you. Dem. See, all alike! the whole gang hangs together: Know one, and you know all. Phæ. Nay, 'tis not so. Dem. One does a fault, the other's hard at hand To bear him out: when t'other slips, he's ready: Each in their turn! Get. I'faith th'old gentleman Has blunder'd on their humours to a hair. Dem. If 'twere not so, you'd not defend him, Phædria. Phæ. If, Uncle, Antipho has done a wrong Or to his interest, or reputation, I am content he suffer, as he may: But if another, with malicious fraud, Has laid a snare for inexperienced youth, And triumph'd o'er it; can you lay the blame On us, or on the judges, who oft take Thro' envy from the rich, or from compassion Add to the poor? Get. Unless I knew the cause, I shou'd imagine this was truth he spoke. Dem. What judge can know the merits on your side, When you put in no plea; as he has done? Phæ. He has behav'd like an ingenuous youth. When he came into court, he wanted pow'r To utter what he had prepar'd, so much He was abash'd by fear and modesty. Get. Oh brave!—But why, without more loss of time, Don't I accost th'old man? [going up.] My master, welcome! I am rejoic'd to see you safe return'd. Dem. What! my good master Governor! your slave! The prop! the pillar of our family! To whom, at my departure hence, I gave My son in charge. Get. I've heard you for some time Accuse us all quite undeservedly, And me, of all, most undeservedly. For what cou'd I have done in this affair? A slave the laws will not allow to plead; Nor can he be an evidence. Dem. I grant it. Nay more—the boy was bashful—I allow it. —You but a slave.—But if she had been prov'd Ever so plainly a relation, why Needed he marry her? and why not rather Give her, according to the law, a portion, By this proposal Terence artfully prepares us for the imposition of Phormio, who extorts money from the old gentleman on this very foundation. Donatus. And let her seek some other for a husband? Why did he rather bring a beggar home? Get. 'Twas not the thought, but money that was wanting. Dem. He might have borrow'd it. Get. Have borrow'd it! Easily said. Dem. If not to be had else, On interest. Get. Nay, now indeed you've hit it. Who wou'd advance him money in your life? Alexander ab Alexandro, Genial. Dier. L. I. takes notice of an antient decree of Senate, derived to the Romans from a law of Solon, in which, in order to provide against young men borrowing money during the life of their fathers, it was ordained, that in case of non-payment, the lender should have no remedy at law. The mischief meant to be guarded against by this decree was, that left the sons of rich men, being involved in debt, should be tempted to extricate themselves by dishonourable means, or even to hasten the death of a parent. Westerhovius. Patrick. Dem. Well, well, it shall not, and it cannot be, That I shou'd suffer her to live with him As wife a single day. There is no cause. —Wou'd I might see that fellow, or cou'd tell Where he resides! Get. What, Phormio! Dem. The girl's Patron. Istum Patronum mulieris. They who undertook to carry on a law-suit for another were called Patroni, Patrons. Get. He shall be with you strait. Dem. Where's Antipho? Phæ. Abroad. Dem. Go, Phædria; find him, bring him here. Phæ. I'll go directly. [Exit. Get. aside.] Ay, to Pamphila. [Exit. SCENE VII. DEMIPHO alone. I'll home, and thank the Gods for my return; It was the custom for those returning from a voyage or journey to give thanks in a formal manner to the Gods, even before they saw their wives or friends. And every citizen had at home Houshold Gods (usually called Penates, Demestici, or Lares) which he and his family worshipped in private, and considered as the particular guardians of the family. Westerhovius. Thence to the Forum, and convene some friends, Who may be present at this interview, That Phormio may not take me unprepar'd. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. PHORMIO, GETA. Phor. And Antipho, you say, has slunk away, Fearing his father's presence? It is said that this play being once rehearsed before Terence and some of his most intimate acquaintance, Ambivius, who acted the part of Phormio, came in drunk, which threw the author into a violent passion: but Ambivius had scarce repeated a few lines, stammering, and scratching his head, before Terence became pacified, declaring that when he was writing those very lines, he absolutely had just such a Parasite, as Ambivius then represented, in his thoughts. Donatus. Get. Very true. Phor. Poor Phanium left alone? Get. 'Tis even so. Phor. And the old gentleman enrag'd? Get. Indeed. Phor. The sum of all then, Phormio, rests on You: On you, and you alone. You've bak'd this cake; E'en eat it for your pains. About it then! Get. I do beseech you. Phor. to himself.] What if he enquire?— Get. Our only hope's in You. Phor. to himself.] I have it!—Then, Suppose he offer to return the girl?— Get. You urg'd us to it. Phor. to himself.] Ay! it shall be so. Get. Assist us! Phor. Let him come, Old Gentleman! 'Tis here: it is engender'd: I am arm'd With all my counsels. Get. What d'ye mean to do? Phor. What wou'd you have me do, unless contrive That Phanium may remain, that Antipho Be freed from blame, and all the the old man's rage Turn'd upon Me? In this scene Terence exhibits the lower order of Parasites, who ingratiated themselves by Sharping and Roguery; as in the Eunuch he describes the Parasites of a higher rank, and of a newer species, who obtained their ends by Flattery. Donatus. Get. Brave fellow! friend indeed! And yet I often tremble for you, Phormio, Lest all this noble confidence of your's End in the stocks at last. In nervum erumpat denique. Several interpretations are given of these words. By some in nervum erumpere is supposed to allude to the drawing of a bow till the string break: but the phrase is more generally supposed in this place to imply some corporal punishment inflicted on malefactors. Quia sæpe in nervum conjiciebantur, ex aliquo maleficio in carcerem missi, says Donatus. Westerhovius explains this passage thus. Est autem Nervus vinculi lignei genus, in quod pedes conjecti arctantur; which is a pretty exact description of the stocks. Phor. Ah, 'tis not so. I'm an old stager too, and know my road. How many men d'ye think I've bastinadoed Almost to death? Aliens, and Citizens? The oftner, still the safer.—Tell me then, Didst ever hear of actions for assault And batt'ry brought against me? Get. How comes that? Phor. Because the net's not stretch'd to catch the hawk, Or kite, who do us wrong; but laid for those, Who do us none at all: In them there's profit, In those mere labour lost. Thus other men May be in danger, who have aught to lose; I, the world knows, have nothing.—You will say, Ducent damnatum domum. Literally, they will lead me condemned home. For, as Donatus observes on this passage, Insolvent Debtors were by the Law made over as slaves to their Creditors. They'll seize my person.—No, they won't maintain A fellow of my stomach.—And they're wise, In my opinion, if for injuries They'll not return the highest benefit. Get. It is impossible for Antipho To give you thanks sufficient. Phor. Rather say, No man sufficiently can thank his patron. This passage is not taken from Apollodorus, but from the sixth book of the satires of Ennius. Quippe sine curâ, lætus, lautus, cum advenis, Infertis malis, expedito brachio, Alacer, celsus, lupino expectans impetu, Mox dum alterius abligurias bona: quid Censes Dominis esse animi? proh divûm fides! Ille tristis cibum dum servat, tu ridens voras. Gay void of care, anointed when you come, With smacking jaw, and arm prepar'd to carve, Keen, eager, and impatient as the Wolf, Expecting every moment to fall on, And gorge yourself at his expence; what, think you, Possesses then the master's mind? Good heaven! He sits, and with a melancholy air Broods o'er the feast, which laughing you devour. Donatus. You at free cost to come! anointed, bath'd, Easy and gay! while he's eat up with care And charge, to cater for your entertainment! He gnaws his heart, you laugh; eat first, sit first, And see Cœna dubia. Phormio explains this expression himself. Horace, who takes frequent opportunities of imitating our author, has adopted this phrase. a Doubtful Banquet plac'd before you! Get. Doubtful! what phrase is that? Phor. Where you're in doubt, What you shall rather chuse. Delights like these, When you but think how sweet, how dear, they are; Him that affords them must you not suppose A very Deity? Get. The old man's here. Mind what you do! the first attack's the fiercest: Sustain but that, the rest will be mere play. [they retire. SCENE II. Enter at a distance DEMIPHO.—HEGIO, CRATINUS, CRITO, following. Dem. Was ever man so grossly treated, think ye? —This way, Sirs, I beseech you. Get. He's enrag'd! Phor. Hist! mind your cue: I'll work him. —[coming forward, and speaking loud.] Oh, ye Gods! Does he deny that Phanium's his relation? What, Demipho! Does Demipho deny That Phanium is his kinswoman? Get. He does. Phor. And who her father was, he does not know? Get. No. Dem. to the Lawyers.] Here's the very fellow, I believe, Of whom I have been speaking.—Follow me! Phor. aloud.] And that he does not know, who Stilpho was? Get. No. Phor. Ah! because, poor thing, she's left in want, Her father is unknown, and she despis'd. What will not avarice do? Get. If you insinuate My master's avaritious, woe be to you! Dem. behind.] Oh impudence! he dares accuse me first. Phor. As to the youth, I cannot take offence, If he had not much knowledge of him; since, Now in the vale of years, in want, his work His livelihood, he nearly altogether Liv'd in the country: where he held a farm Under my father. I have often heard The poor old man complain, that this his kinsman Neglected him.—But what a man! A man Of most exceeding virtue. Get. Much at one: Yourself and He you praise so much. Phor. Away! Had I not thought him what I've spoken of him, I wou'd not for his daughter's sake have drawn So many troubles on our family, Whom this old cuff now treats so scandalously. Get. What, still abuse my absent master, Rascal! Phor. It is no more than he deserves. Get. How, villain! Dem. Geta! [calling. Get. Rogue, Robber, Pettyfogger! [to Phormio, pretending not to hear Demipho.] Dem. Geta! Phor. Answer. [apart to Geta. Get. turning.] Who's that?—Oh! Dem. Peace! Get. Behind your back All day without cessation has this knave Thrown scurvy terms upon you, such as none But men, like him, can merit. Dem. Well! have done: [putting Geta by, then addressing Phormio. Young man! permit me first to ask one question, And, if you please, vouchsafe to answer me. —Who was this friend of your's? Explain! and how Might he pretend that I was his relation? Phor. So! you fish for't, as if you didn't know. [sneeringly. Dem. Know! I! Phor. Ay; you. Dem. Not I: You, that maintain I ought, instruct me how to recollect. Phor. What! not acquainted with your cousin? Dem. Plague! Tell me his name. Phor. His name? ay! Dem. Well, why don't you? Phor. Confusion! I've forgot the name. In the Trinummus of Plautus, where a sharper is employed, like Phormio, to carry on an imposture, He in like manner forgets the name of the person from whom he pretends to come; and what renders the circumstance still more pleasant is, that he happens to be engaged in conversation with the very person himself. The Trinummus, taken all together, is, I think, inferior to this play of our author; but there are in it some scenes of uncommon pleasantry. [apart. Dem. What say you? Phor. Geta, if you remember, prompt me. [apart to Geta.]—Pshaw! I will not tell.—As if you didn't know, You're come to try me. loud to Demipho. Dem. How! I try you? Get. Stilpho. [whispering Phormio. Phor. What is't to me?—Stilpho. Dem. Whom say you? Phor. Stilpho: Did you know Stilpho, Sir? Dem. I neither know him; Nor ever had I kinsman of that name. Phor. How! are you not asham'd?—But if, poor man, Stilpho had left behind him an estate Of some ten Talents— Dem. Out upon You! Phor. Then You would have been the first to trace your line Quite from your Grandsire and Great Grandsire. Dem. True. Had I then come, I'd have explain'd at large How she was my relation: So do You! Say, how is she my kinswoman? Get. Well said! Master, you're right.—Take heed! [apart to Phormio. Phor. I have explain'd All that most clearly, where I ought, in court. If it were false, why did not then your son Refute it? Dem. Do you tell me of my son? Whose folly can't be spoke of, as it ought. Phor. But You, who are so wise, go, seek the judge: Ask sentence in the self-same cause again: Quandoquidem solus regnas. An invidious sneer; because in Athens, where the people were tenacious of liberty and the laws, arbitrary acts were particularly odious. Thus Sannio in the Brothers; Regnumne, Æschine, hic tu possides? “Do you reign King here, Æschinus?” Donatus. Because You're Lord alone; and have alone Pow'r to obtain the judgement of the court Twice in one cause. Dem. Although I have been wrong'd, Yet, rather than engage in litigation, And rather than hear You; as if she were Indeed related to us, as the law Ordains, I'll pay her dowry: Take her hence, And with her take five Minæ. Phor. Ha! ha! ha! A pleasant gentleman! Dem. Why, what's the matter? Have I demanded any thing unjust? Sha'n't I obtain this neither, which is law? Phor. Is't even so, Sir?—Like a common harlot When you've abus'd her, does the law ordain That you shou'd pay her hire, and whistle her off? Or, lest a citizen thro' poverty Bring shame upon her honour, does it order That she be given to her next of kin To pass her life with him? which you forbid. Dem. Ay; to her next of kin: But why to Us; Or wherefore? Phor. Oh! that matter is all settled: Think on't no more. Dem. Not think on't! I shall think Of nothing else, till there's an end of this. Phor. Words, words! Dem. I'll make them good. Phor. But, after all, With You I have no business, Demipho! Your Son is cast, not You: for at your age The coupling-time is over. Dem. Be assur'd That all I've said, He says: Or I'll forbid Him and this wife of his my house. Get. He's angry. [apart. Phor. No; you'll think better on't. Dem. Are you resolv'd, Wretch that you are, to thwart me ev'ry way? Phor. (apart) He fears, tho' he dissembles. Get. (apart) Well begun! Phor. Well; but what can't be cur'd must be endur'd: 'Twere well, and like yourself, that we were friends. Dem. I! friend to you? or chuse to see, or hear you! Phor. Do but agree with her, you'll have a girl To comfort your old age. Your years, consider! Dem. Plague on your comfort! take her to yourself! Phor. Ah! don't be angry! Dem. One word more, I've done. See that you fetch away this wench, and soon, Or I shall turn her headlong out o'doors. So much for Phormio! Phor. Offer but to touch her, In any other manner than beseems A gentlewoman and a citizen, And I shall bring a swinging writ against you. So much for Demipho!—If I am wanted, I am at home, d'ye hear? [apart to Geta. Get. I understand. [apart.] [Exit Phormio. SCENE III. Dem. With how much care, and what sollicitude, My son affects me, with this wretched match Having embroil'd himself and me! nor comes Into my sight, that I might know at least Or what he says, or thinks of this affair. Go, you; and see if he's come home, or no. Get. I'm gone. [Exit. Dem. You see, Sirs, how this matter stands. What shall I do? Say, Hegio! Heg. Meaning me? Cratinus, please you, shou'd speak first. Dem. Say then, Cratinus! Cra. Me d'ye question? Dem. You. Cra. Then I, Whatever steps are best I'd have you take. Thus it appears to Me. Whate'er your son Has in your absence done, is null and void In law and equity.—And so you'll find. That's my opinion. Dem. Say now, Hegio? Heg. He has, I think, pronounc'd most learnedly. But so 'tis: many men, and many minds! Each has his fancy: Now, in my opinion, Whate'er is done by law, can't be undone. 'Tis shameful to attempt it. Dem. Say you, Crito! Cri. The case, I think, asks more deliberation. 'Tis a nice point. Heg. Wou'd you aught else with us? Dem. You've utter'd Oracles. [Exeunt Lawyers.] I'm more uncertain Now than I was before. I believe there is no scene of Comedy more highly seasoned with the Ridiculous than this before us. The idea is truly comick, and it is worked up with all that simplicity and chastity, so peculiar to the manner of Terence. An ordinary writer would have indulged himself in twenty little conceits on this occasion; but the dry gravity of Terence infinitely surpasses, as true humour, all the drolleries, which perhaps even those great Masters of Comedy, Plautus or Moliere, might have been tempted to throw out. It is the highest art of a Dramatick Author on some occasions to leave a good deal to the Actor: it has been remarked by Heinsius and others, that Terence was particularly attentive to this circumstance; and Donatus in his preface to this Comedy says, that it is tota diverbiis facetissimis, &amp; gestum desiderantibus scenicum. Re-enter GETA. Get. He's not return'd. Dem. My Brother, as I hope, will soon arrive: Whate'er advice he gives me, that I'll follow. I'll to the Port, and ask when they expect him. [Exit. Get. And I'll go find out Antipho, and tell him All that has past.—But here he comes in time. Sed eccum ipsum video in tempore huc se recipere. Here in all the common books ends the second act; and the scenes that make up the residue of it here, in them compose the third. Madam Dacier saw the absurdity, but follows the old division, arbitrarily omitting the above line, in order to break the palpable continuity of the scenes; and make the stage appear to be vacant. But the line in question is in all the copies: nor is it likely that in so busy a play, the Author would have devoted a whole act to the Episode of Phædria and his Musick-Girl. The division of the acts in this play is so extremely confused in all the books I have seen, that I have varied from them all. I have endeavoured to find out the natural rests or pauses in the action, and to divide the acts in such a manner, as to assign a particular business to each. See the first note to Act V. SCENE IV. Enter at a distance ANTIPHO. Ant. to himself.] Indeed, indeed, my Antipho, You're much to blame, to be so poor in spirit. What! steal away so guilty-like? and trust Your life and safety to the care of others? Would They be touch'd more nearly than Yourself? Come what come might of ev'ry thing beside, Could you abandon the dear maid at home? Could you so far deceive her easy faith, And leave her to misfortune and distress? Her, who plac'd all her hopes in you alone? Get. coming forwards.] I'faith, Sir, we have thought you much to blame For your long absence.— Ant. You're the very man That I was looking for. Get. —But ne'ertheless We've mist no opportunity. Ant. Oh, speak! How go my fortunes, Geta? has my father Any suspicion that I was in league With Phormio? Get. Not a jot. Ant. And may I hope? Get. I don't know. Ant. Ah! Get. Unless that Phædria Did all he could do for you.— Ant. Nothing new. Get. —And Phormio, as on all occasions else, Prov'd himself a brave fellow. Ant. What did He? Get. Out-swagger'd your hot father. Ant. Well said, Phormio! Get. —I did the best I could too. Ant. Honest Geta, I am much bounden to you all. Get. Thus, Sir, Stand things at present. As yet all is calm. Your father means to wait your uncle's coming. Ant. For what? Get. For his advice, as he propos'd; By which he will be rul'd in this affair. Ant. How do I dread my uncle's coming, Geta, Since by his sentence I must live or die! Get. But here comes Phædria. Ant. Where? Get. Ab suâ palæstrâ.—Palæstra was properly the School of Gymnastick Exercises for the Græcian youth. Geta therefore, in allusion to that, pleasantly calls the Procurer's house the palæstra of Phædria, much in the same vein of humour that he used in talking of him at the opening of the play.From his old school. [they retire. SCENE V. Enter, from Dorio's, DORIO, PHÆDRIA following. Phæ. Nay, hear me, Dorio! Dorio. Not I. Phæ. But a word! Dorio. Let me alone. Phæ. Pray, hear me! Dorio. I am tir'd With hearing the same thing a thousand times. Phæ. But what I'd say, you would be glad to hear. Dorio. Speak then! I hear. Phæ. Can't I prevail on you To stay but these three days?—Nay, where d'ye go? Dorio. I should have wonder'd had you said aught new. Ant. behind.] This Pimp, I fear, will work himself no good. Metuo lenonem, nequid suo suat capiti. This passage has much puzzled the Commentators. I have followed Madam Dacier, though I do not think that her interpretation of the passage, or any other comment that I have seen, makes very good sense of it. Get. I fear so too. Phæ. Won't you believe me? Dorio. Guess. Phæ. Upon my honour. Dorio. Nonsense. Phæ. 'Tis a kindness Shall be repaid with interest. Dorio. Words, words! Phæ. You'll be glad on't; you will, believe me. Dorio. Pshaw! Phæ. Try; 'tis not long. Dorio. You're in the same tune still. Phæ. My kinsman, parent, friend,— Dorio. Ay, talk away. Phæ. Can you be so inflexible, so cruel, That neither pity, nor entreaties touch you? Dorio. And can You be so inconsiderate, And so unconscionable, Phædria, To think that you can talk me to your purpose, And wheedle me to give the girl for nothing? Ant. behind.] Poor Phædria! Phæ. to himself.] Alas, he speaks the truth. Get. to Ant.] How well they each support their characters! Phæ. to himself.] Then that this evil should have come upon me, When Antipho was in the like distress! Ant. going up.] Ha! what now, Phædria? Phæ. Happy, happy Antipho!— Ant. I? Phæ. Who have her you love in your possession, Nor e'er had plagues like these, to struggle with! Ant. In my possession? yes, I have, indeed, As the old saying goes, a Wolf by th'Ears: Auribus teneo lupum. A proverb; the meaning of which is explained in the next line. For I can neither part with her, nor keep her. Dorio. 'Tis just my case with him. Ant. to Dorio.] Thou thorough Bawd! —to Phædria.] What has he done? Phæ. Done?—The inhuman wretch Has sold my Pamphila. Get. What! Sold her? Ant. Sold her? Phæ. Yes; sold her. Dorio, laughing.] Sold her.—What a monstrous crime! A wench he paid his ready money for. Phæ. I can't prevail upon him, to wait for me, And to stave off his bargain but three days; Till I obtain the money from my friends, According to their promise.—If I do not Pay it you then, don't wait a moment longer. Dorio. You stun me. Ant. 'Tis a very little time, For which he asks your patience, Dorio. Let him prevail on you; your complaisance Shall be requited doubly. Dorio. Words; mere words! Ant. Can you then bear to see your Pamphila Torn from this city, Phædria?—Can you, Dorio, Divide their loves? Dorio. Nor I, not you. Get. Plague on you! Dorio, to Phæ.] I have, against my natural disposition, Born with you several months, still promising, Whimpering, and ne'er performing any thing: Now, on the contrary, I've found a spark, Who'll prove a ready-paymaster, no sniveler: Give place then to your betters! Anti. Surely, Phædria, There was, if I remember, a day settled That you should pay the money down. Phæ. There was. Dorio. Do I deny it? Ant. Is the day past? Dorio. No. But this has come before it. Ant. Infamous! Ar'n't you asham'd of such base treachery? Dorio. Not I, while I can get by't. Get. Scavenger! Phæ. Is this just dealing, Dorio? Dorio. 'Tis my way: So, if you like me, use me. Ant. Can you deceive him thus? Dorio. Nay, Antipho, 'Tis he deceives me: he was well aware What kind of man I was, but I believ'd Him diff'rent. He has disappointed me, But I am still the same to him as ever. However, thus much I can do for him; The Captain promis'd to pay down the money To-morrow morning. But now, Phædria, If you come first, I'll follow my old rule, “The first to pay, shall be first serv'd.” Farewell. [Exit. SCENE VI. PHÆDRIA, ANTIPHO, GETA. Phæ. What shall I do? Unhappy that I am, How shall I, who am almost worse than nothing, Raise such a sum so suddenly?—Alas! Had I prevail'd on him to wait three days, I had a promise of it. Ant. Shall we, Geta, Suffer my Phædria to be miserable? My best friend Phædria, who but now, you said, Assisted me so heartily?—No.—Rather Let us, since there is need, return his kindness! Get. It is but just, I must confess. Ant. Come then; 'Tis you alone can save him. Get. By what means? Ant. Procure the money. Get. Willingly: but whence? Ant. My father is arriv'd. Get. He is: what then? Ant. A word to the wife, Geta! Get. Say you so? Ant. Ev'n so. Get. By Hercules, 'tis rare advice. Are you there with me? will it not be triumph, So I but scape a scouring for your match, That you must urge me to run risk for him? Ant. He speaks the truth, I must confess. Phæ. How's that? Am I a stranger to you, Geta? Get. No: Nor do I hold you such. But is it nothing, That the old man now rages at us all, Unless we irritate him so much further, As to preclude all hopes to pacify him? Phæ. Shall then another bear her hence? Ah me! Now then, while I remain, speak to me, Antipho. Behold me! Ant. Wherefore? what is it you mean? Phæ. Wherever she's convey'd, I'll follow her; Or perish. Get. Heaven prosper your designs!— Gently, Sir, gently! Ant. See, if you can help him. Get. Help him! but how? Ant. Nay, think, invent, devise; Lest he do something we repent of, Geta! Get. I'm thinking. [pausing.]—Well then, I believe, he's safe. But I'm afraid of mischief. Ant. Never fear: We'll bear all good and evil fortune with you. Get. Tell me the sum you have occasion for. Phæ. But thirty Minæ. Get. Thirty! monstrous, Phædria! She's very dear. Phæ. Dog-cheap. Get. Well, say no more. I'll get them for you. Phæ. O brave fellow! Get. Hence! Phæ. But I shall want it now. Get. You'll have it now. But Phormio must assist me in this business. Ant. He's ready: lay what load you will upon him, He'll bear it all; for he's a friend indeed. Get. Let's to him quickly then! After this in some books is inserted a speech of Phædria; Abi, dic, præsto ut sit domi. “Go, tell him to be at home.” But it confounds the sense in this place, and it is plain that Phædria and Geta go out together. Ant. D'ye want my help? Get. We've no occasion for you. Get you home To the poor girl, who's almost dead with fear; And see you comfort her.—Away! d'ye loiter? Ant. There's nothing I would do so willingly. [Exit. Phæ. But how will you effect this? Get. I'll explain That matter as we go along.—Away! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter DEMIPHO and CHREMES. Dem. Well, Chremes? have you brought your daughter with you, On whose account you went to Lemnos? Chre. No. Dem. Why not? Chre. It seems the mother, grown impatient, Perceiving that I tarried here so long, And that the girl's age brook'd not my delays, Had journied here, they said, in search of me, With her whole family. Dem. Appriz'd of this, What kept you there so long then? Chre. A disease. Dem. How came it? what disease? Chre. Is that a question? Old age itself is a disease.—However, The master of the ship, who brought them over, Inform'd me of their safe arrival hither. Dem. Have you heard, Chremes, of my son's misfortune During my absence? Chre. Ay; and it confounds me. For to another should I tender her, I must relate the girl's whole history, And whence arises my connexion with her. You I can trust as safely as myself: But if a stranger courts alliance with me, While we're new friends, he'll hold his peace perhaps, But if he cools, he'll know too much of me. Then I'm afraid my wife should know of this; Which if she does, I've nothing else to do, But shake myself, Ut me excutiam. Alluding to the manners of the Greek and Eastern nations, who always shook their cloaths at the doors of the houses, that they abandoned. Dacier. and leave my house directly: For I've no friend at home, except myself. Dem. I know it; and 'tis that which touches me. Nor are there any means I'll leave untried, Till I have made my promise to you good. SCENE II. Enter, at another part of the Stage, GETA. Get. to himself.] I never saw a more shrewd rogue than Phormio. I came to let him know, we wanted money, With my device for getting it; and scarce Had I related half, but he conceiv'd me. He was o'erjoy'd; commended me; demanded To meet with Demipho; and thank'd the Gods, That it was now the time to shew himself As truly Phædria's friend, as Antipho's. I bad him wait us at the Forum; whither I'd bring th'old gentleman.—And there he is! —But who's the furthermost? Ha! Phædria's father. —Yet what was I afraid of, Simpleton? That I have got two dupes instead of one? Is it not better that my hopes are doubled? —I'll attack him, I first propos'd. If He Answers my expectation, well: if not, Why then have at you, Uncle! SCENE III. Enter behind ANTIPHO. Ant. to himself.] I expect Geta's arrival presently.—But see! Yonder's my Uncle with my father.—Ah! How do I dread his influence! Get. I'll to them. Oh, good Sir Chremes! [going up. Chre. Save you, save you, Geta! Get. I'm glad to see you safe arriv'd. Chre. I thank you. Get. How go affairs? Chre. A world of changes here, As usual at first coming home again. Get. True. Have you heard of Antipho's affair? Chre. The whole. Get. to Demipho.] Did you inform him, Sir?—'Tis monstrous, Chremes, To be so shamefully impos'd upon! Dem. 'Twas on that point I was just talking with him. Get. And I too, having turn'd it in my thoughts, Have found, I think, a remedy. Dem. How, Geta? What remedy? Get. On leaving you, by chance I met with Phormio. Chre. Who is Phormio? Get. The girl's sollicitor. Chre. I understand. Get. I thought within myself, “suppose I found him!” And taking him aside, “Now prithee, Phormio, “Why don't you try to settle this affair “By fair means rather than by foul? said I. “My master is a generous gentleman, “And hates to go to law. For I assure you, “His other friends advis'd him, to a man, “To turn this girl directly out o'doors. Ant. behind.] What does he mean? or where will all this end? Get. “The law, you think, will give you damages, “If he attempts to turn her out.—Alas, “He has had counsel upon that.—I'faith, “You'll have hot work, if you engage with Him; “He's such an Orator!—But ev'n suppose “That you should gain your law-suit, after all “The trial is not for his life, but money.” Perceiving him a little wrought upon, And soften'd by this stile of talking with him, “Come now,” continued I, “we're all alone. “Tell me, what money would you take in hand “To drop your law-suit, take away the girl, “And trouble us no farther?” Ant. behind.] Is he mad? Get. —“For I am well convinc'd, that if your terms “Are not extravagant and wild indeed, “My master's such a worthy gentleman, “You will not change three words between you.” Dem. Who Commission'd you to say all this? Chre. Nay, nay, Nothing could be more happy to effect The point we labour at. Ant. behind.] Undone! Chre. to Geta.] Go on. Get. At first he rav'd. Dem. Why, what did he demand? Get. Too much: as much as came into his head. Chre. Well, but the sum? Get. He talk'd of a Great Talent. Talentum Magnum. Among the antient writers we meet sometimes with the word Talent simply; sometimes it is called A Great Talent; and sometimes an Attick Talent; which all import the same, when to be understood of Grecian money. Patrick. Dem. Plague on the rascal! what! has he no shame? Get. The very thing I said to him.—“Suppose “He was to portion out an only daughter, “What could he give her more?—He profits little, “Having no daughter of his own; since one “Is found, to carry off a fortune from him.” —But to be brief, and not to dwell upon All his impertinencies, He at last Gave me this final answer.—“From the first, “I wish'd, said he, as was indeed most fit, “To wed the daughter of my friend myself. “For I was well aware of her misfortune; “That, being poor, she would be rather given “In slavery, than wedlock, to the rich. “But I was forc'd, to tell you the plain truth, “To take a woman with some little fortune, “To pay my debts: and still, if Demipho “Is willing to advance as large a sum, “As I'm to have with one I'm now engag'd to, “There is no wife I'd rather take than Her.” Ant. behind.] Whether through malice, or stupidity, He is rank knave or fool, I cannot tell. Dem. to Geta.] What, if he owes his soul? Get. “I have a farm,” Continued he, “that's mortgag'd for Ten Minæ.” Dem. Well, let him take her then: I'll pay the money. Get. “A house for ten more.” Dem. Huy! huy! that's too much. Chre. No noise! demand those ten of me. Get. “My wife “Must buy a maid; some little furniture “Is also requisite; and some expence “To keep our wedding: all these articles,” Continues he, “we'll reckon at Ten Minæ.” Dem. No; let him bring a thousand writs against me. Sexcentas scribito jam mihi dicas. Donatus observes on this passage that Six Hundred was used by the Romans for an indefinite number, as Ten Thousand was among the Greeks; wherefore Terence, according to the different genius of the two languages, renders the ?????? of Apollodorus by sexcentas. I have in like manner rendered the sexcentas of Terence by a Thousand, as being most agreeable to the English idiom. I'll give him nothing. What! afford the villain An opportunity to laugh at me? Chre. Nay, but be pacified! I'll pay the money. Only do you prevail upon your son To marry her, whom we desire. Ant. behind.] Ah me! Geta, your treachery has ruin'd me. Chre. She's put away on my account: 'tis just That I should pay the money: Geta. “Let me know,” Continues he, “as soon as possible, “Whether they mean to have me marry her; “That I may part with t'other, and be certain. “For t'other girl's relations have agreed “To pay the portion down immediately.” Chre. He shall be paid this too immediately. Let him break off with her, and take this girl! Dem. Ay, and the plague go with him! Chre. Luckily It happens I've some money here; the rents Of my wife's farms at Lemnos. I'll take that; [to Demipho. And tell my wife, that you had need of it. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Manent ANTIPHO, GETA. Ant. coming forward.] Geta! Get. Ha, Antipho! Ant. What have you done? Geta. Trick'd the old bubbles of their money. Ant. Well, Is that sufficient, think ye? Get. I can't tell. 'Twas all my orders. Ant. Knave, d'ye shuffle with me? [kicks him. Get. Plague! what d'ye mean? Ant. What do I mean, sirrah! You've driven me to absolute perdition. All pow'rs of heav'n and hell confound you for't, And make you an example to all villains! —Here! would you have your business duly manag'd, Commit it to this fellow! Huic mandes, quod quidem recte curatum velis. In some editions and manuscripts we read, instead of this verse, Huic mandes, qui te ad scopulum é tranquillo inferat.—But the most judicious Criticks have rejected it as spurious. Patrick.—What could be More tender than to touch upon this sore, Or even name my wife? My father's fill'd With hopes that she may be dismiss'd.—And then, If Phormio gets the money for the portion, He to be sure must marry her.—And what Becomes of Me then? Get. He'll not marry her. Ant. Oh, no: but when they re-demand the money, On my account he'll rather go to jail! [ironically. Get. Many a tale is spoilt in telling, Antipho. You take out all the good, and leave the bad. —Now hear the other side.—If he receives The money, he must wed the girl: I grant it. But then some little time must be allow'd For wedding-preparation, invitation, And sacrifices.—Meanwhile, Phædria's friends Advance the money they have promis'd him: Which Phormio shall make use of for repayment. Ant. How so? what reason can he give? Get. What reason? A thousand.—“Since I made this fatal bargain, “Omens and prodigies have happen'd to me. “There came a strange black dog into my house! “A snake fell through the tiling! a hen crow'd! “The Soothsayer forbad it! The Diviner “Charg'd me to enter on no new affair “Before the winter.”—All sufficient reasons. Thus it shall be. Ant. Pray heav'n, it may! Get. It shall. Depend on me:—But here's your father.—Go; Tell Phædria that the money's safe. [Exit Antipho. SCENE V. Re-enter DEMIPHO and CHREMES. Dem. Nay, peace! I'll warrant he shall play no tricks upon us: I'll not part rashly with it, I assure you; But pay it before witnesses, reciting To whom 'tis paid, and why 'tis paid. Get. How cautious, Where there is no occasion! [aside. Chre. You had need. But haste, dispatch it while the fit's upon him: For if the other party should be pressing, Perhaps he'll break with us. Get. You've hit it, Sir. Dem. Carry me to him then. Get. I wait your pleasure. Chre. to Dem.] When this is done, step over to my wife, That she may see the girl before she goes; And tell her, to prevent her being angry, “That we've agreed to marry her to Phormio, “Her old acquaintance, and a fitter match; “That we have not been wanting in our duty, “But giv'n as large a portion as he ask'd.” Dem. Pshaw! what's all this to you? Chre. A great deal, Brother. Dem. Is't not sufficient to have done your duty, Unless the world approves it? Chre. I would chuse To have the whole thing done by her consent: Lest she pretend she was turn'd out o'doors. Dem. Well, I can say all this to her myself. Chre. A woman deals much better with a woman. Dem. I'll ask your wife to do it then. [Exeunt Demipho and Geta. Chre. I'm thinking, This is intended as a transition to the next scene; but I think it would have been better if it had followed without this kind of introduction. The scene itself is admirable, and is in many places both affecting and comick, and the discovery of the real character of Phanium is made at a very proper time. Where I shall find these women now. SCENE VI. Enter SOPHRONA at a distance. Soph. to herself.] Alas! What shall I do, unhappy as I am? Where find a friend? to whom disclose this story? Of whom beseech assistance?—For I fear My mistress will sustain some injury From following my counsel: the youth's father, I hear, is so offended at this marriage. Chre. Who's this old woman, coming from my brother's, That seems so terrified? Soph. to herself.] 'Twas poverty Compell'd me to this action: tho' I knew This match would hardly hold together long, Yet I advis'd her to it, that meanwhile She might not want subsistence. Chre. Surely, surely, Either my mind deceives me, or eyes fail me, Or that's my daughter's nurse. Among the antients the Nurses, after having brought up children of their own sex, never quitted them; which is the reason that in their plays Nurses are most generally chosen for confidantes. Rousseau's Emile. Soph. Nor can we find— Chre. What shall I do? Soph. —Her father out. Chre. Were't best I should go up to her, or wait a little, To gather something more from her discourse? Soph. Could he be found, my fears were at an end. Chre. 'Tis she. I'll speak with her. Soph. overhearing.] Whose voice is that? Chre. Sophrona! Soph. Ha! my name too? Chre. Look this way. Soph. turning.] Good heav'n have mercy on us! Stilpho! Chre. No. Soph. Deny your own name? Chre. in a low voice.] This way, Sophrona!— —A little further from that door!—this way!— And never call me by that name, I charge you. Soph. What! ar'n't you then the man you said you was? aloud. Chre. Hist! hist! Soph. What makes you fear those doors so much? Chre. I have a fury of a wise within: And formerly I went by that false name, Lest ye should indiscreetly blab it out, And so my wife might come to hear of this. Soph. Ah! thus it was, that we, alas, poor souls, Could never find you out here. Chre. Well, but tell me, What business have you with that family? [pointing. —Where is your mistress and her daughter? Soph. Ah! Chre. What now? are they alive? Soph. The daughter is: The mother broke her heart with grief. Chre. Alas! Soph. And I, a poor, unknown, distress'd old woman, Endeavouring to manage for the best, Contriv'd to match the virgin to a youth, Son to the master of this house. Chre. To Antipho? Soph. The very same. Chre. What! has he two wives then? Soph. No, mercy on us! he has none but her. Chre. What is the other then, who, they pretend, Is a relation to him? Soph. This is she. Chre. How say you? Soph. It was all a mere contrivance; That he, who was in love, might marry her Without a portion. Chre. O ye pow'rs of heaven, How often fortune blindly brings about More than we dare to hope for! Coming home, I've found my daughter, even to my wish, Match'd to the very person I desir'd. What we have both been labouring to effect, Has this poor woman all alone accomplish'd. Soph. But now consider what is to be done! The bridegroom's father is return'd: and He, They say, is much offended at this marriage. Chre. Be of good comfort: there's no danger there. But, in the name of heav'n and earth, I charge you, Let nobody discover she's my daughter. Soph. None shall discover it from me. Chre. Come then! Follow me in, and you shall hear the rest. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. DEMIPHO, GETA. Dem. 'Tis our own fault, that we encourage rogues, By over-straining the due character Of honesty and generosity. Ita fugias ne præter casam. Literally, “Fly so, as not to pass the house.” Commentators have been pleased to consider this as the most difficult passage in any part of our Author's works. But the occasion on which the proverb is here used, and the whole tenor of Demipho's speech make the import of it impossible to be mistaken: Donatus long ago properly explained it, Queritur senex se, dum avari infamiam fugeret, in stulti reprehensionem incidisse.—“The old man complains, that while he was endeavouring to avoid the charge of being a miser, he had laid himself open to the imputation of being a fool.” “Shoot not beyond the mark,” the proverb goes. Was't not enough that he had done us wrong, But we must also throw him money too, To live, till he devises some new mischief? Get. Very right! Dem. Knavery's now its own reward. Get. Very true! Dem. How like fools have we behav'd! Get. So as he keeps his word, and takes the girl, 'Tis well enough. Dem. Is that a doubt at present? Get. A man, you know, may change his mind. Dem. How! change? Get. That I can't tell: but, if perhaps, I say. Dem. I'll now perform my promise to my brother, And bring his wife to talk to the young woman. You, Geta, go before, and let her know Nausistrata will come and speak with her. [Exit Demipho. SCENE II. GETA alone. The money's got for Phædria: all is hush'd: And Phanium is not to depart as yet. What more then? where will all this end at last? —Alas, you're sticking in the same mire still: You've only chang'd hands, Geta. Versurâ solvere, to change one creditor for another. Donatus. The disaster, That hung but now directly over you, Delay perhaps will bring more heavy on you. Plagæ crescunt. Plagæ is generally understood here to signify blows: but as Geta is full of metaphors in this speech, I am apt to think the words mean “the snares increase,” which agrees better with the following clause, nisi prospicis, and is a sense in which the plural of plaga is often used. You're quite beset, unless you look about. —Now then I'll home; to lesson Phanium, That she mayn't stand in fear of Phormio, Nor dread this conf'rence with Nausistrata. Ejus orationem. Ejus here is not to be understood of Phormio, but Nausistrata: and perhaps Terence wrote hujus. Dacier. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter DEMIPHO and NAUSISTRATA. Dem. Come then, Nausistrata, afford us now A little of your usual art, and try To put this woman in good humour with us: That what is done, she may do willingly. Nau. I will. Dem. —And now assist us with your counsel, As with your cash a little while ago. Alluding to the money borrowed of her to pay Phormio; and, as Donatus observes in another place, it is admirably contrived, in order to bring about a humorous catastrophe, that Chremes should make use of his wife's money on this occasion. Nau. With all my heart: and I am only sorry That 'tis my husband's fault I can't do more. Dem. How so? Nau. Because he takes such little care Of the estate my father nurs'd so well: For from these very farms he never fail'd To draw Two Talents by the year. But ah! What difference between man and man! Dem. Two Talents? Nau. Ay—in worse times than these—and yet Two Talents Dem. Huy! Nau. What, are you surpriz'd? Dem. Prodigiously. Nau. Would I had been a man! I'd shew— Dem. No doubt. Nau. —By what means— Dem. Nay, but spare yourself a little For the encounter with the girl: lest she, Flippant and young, may weary you too much. Nau. —Well, I'll obey your orders: but I see My husband coming forth. SCENE IV. Enter CHREMES hastily. Chre. Ha! Demipho! Has Phormio had the money yet? Dem. I paid him Immediately. Chre. I'm sorry for't.—[seeing Nausistrata.]—My wife! I'd almost said too much. [aside. Dem. Why sorry, Chremes? Chre. Nothing.—No matter. Dem. Well, but hark ye, Chremes. Have you been talking with the girl, and told her Wherefore we bring your wife? Chre. I've settled it. Dem. Well, and what says she? Chre. 'Tis impossible To send her hence. Dem. And why impossible? Chre. Because they're both so fond of one another. Dem. What's that to Us? Chre. A great deal. And besides, I have discover'd she's related to us. Dem. Have you your wits? Chre. 'Tis so. I'm very serious. —Nay, recollect a little! Dem. Are you mad? Nau. Good now, beware of wronging a relation! Dem. She's no relation to us. Chre. Don't deny it. Her father had assum'd another name, And that deceiv'd you. Dem. What! not know her father? Chre. Perfectly. Dem. Why did she misname him then? Chre. Won't you be rul'd, nor understand me then? Dem. What can I understand from nothing? Chre. Still? [impatiently. Nau. I can't imagine what this means. Dem. Nor I. Chre. Wou'd you know all?—Why then, so help me heaven, She has no nearer kindred in the world, Than you and I. Dem. Oh, all ye pow'rs of heaven! —Let us go to her then immediately: I wou'd fain know, or not know, all at once. [going. Chre. Ah! [stopping him. Dem. What's the matter? Chre. Can't you trust me then? Dem. Must I believe it? take it upon trust? —Well, be it so!—But what is to be done With our friend's daughter? Chre. Nothing. Dem. Drop her? Chre. Ay. Dem. And keep this? Chre. Ay. Dem. Why then, Nausistrata, You may return. We need not trouble you. Nau. Indeed, I think, 'tis better on all sides, That you should keep her here, than send her hence. For she appear'd to me, when first I saw her, Much of a gentlewoman. [Exit Nausistrata. The perplexed situation of the characters in the above scene is truly comick. SCENE V. Manent DEMIPHO and CHREMES. Dem. What means this? Chre. looking after Nausistrata.] Is the door shut? Dem. It is. Chre. O Jupiter! The Gods take care of us. I've found my daughter Married to your son. Dem. Ha! how could it be? Chre. It is not safe to tell you here. Dem. Step in then. Chre. But hark ye, Demipho!—I would not have Even our very sons inform'd of this. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. ANTIPHO alone. I'm glad, however my affairs proceed, That Phædria's have succeeded to his mind. How wise, to foster such desires alone, As, altho' cross'd, are easily supplied! Money, once found, sets Phædria at his ease; But my distress admits no remedy. For, if the secret's kept, I live in fear; And if reveal'd, I am expos'd to shame. Nor would I now return, but in the hope Of still possessing her.—But where is Geta? That I may learn of him, the fittest time To meet my father. SCENE VII. Enter at a distance PHORMIO. Phor. to himself.] I've receiv'd the money; Paid the Procurer; carried off the wench; Who's free, and now in Phædria's possession. One thing alone remains to be dispatch'd; To get a respite from th'old gentlemen To tipple some few days, which I must spend In mirth and jollity. Ant. But yonder's Phormio.— [goes up. What now? Phor. Of what? Ant. What's Phædria about? How does he mean to take his fill of love? Phor. By acting your part in his turn. Ant. What part? Phor. Flying his father's presence.—And he begs That you'd act his, and make excuses for him: For he intends a drinking-bout with Me. I shall pretend to the old gentlemen That I am going to the fair at Sunium, To buy the servant-maid, that Geta mention'd: Lest, finding I am absent, they suspect That I am squandering the sum they paid me. —But your door opens. Ant. Who comes here? Phor. 'Tis Geta. SCENE VIII. Enter hastily, at another part of the Stage, GETA. Get. O Fortune, a best Fortune, O Fortuna! O Fors Fortuna! Fortuna signified simply chance; but Fors Fortuna meant Good Fortune, and there was a Temple to this Goddess near the Tiber. Donatus.what high blessings, What sudden, great, and unexpected joys Hast thou show'r'd down on Antipho to-day!— Ant. What can this be, he's so rejoic'd about? Get. —And from what fears deliver'd Us, his friends? —But wherefore do I loiter thus? and why Do I not throw my cloak upon my shoulder, And hast to find him out, that he may know All that has happen'd? Ant. to Phormio.] Do you comprehend What he is talking of? Phor. Do you? Ant. Not I. Phor. I'm just as wise as you. Get. I'll hurry hence To the Procurer's.—I shall find them there. [going. Ant. Ho, Geta! Get. Look ye there!—Is't new or strange, To be recall'd when one's in haste? [going. Ant. Here, Geta! Get. Again? Bawl on! l'll ne'er stop. [going on. Ant. Stay, I say! Get. Go, and be drubb'd! Ant. You shall, I promise you, Unless you stop, you Rascal! Get. stopping.] Hold, hold, Geta! Some intimate acquaintance this, be sure, Being so free with you.—But is it he, That I am looking for, or not?—'Tis He. Phor. Go up immediately. [they go up to Geta. Ant. to Geta.] What means all this? Get. O happy man! the happiest man on earth! So very happy, that, beyond all doubt, You are the God's chief fav'rite, Antipho. Ant. Would I were! but your reason. Get. Is't enough, To plunge you over head and ears in joy? Ant. You torture me. Phor. No promises! but tell us. What is your news? Get. Oh, Phormio! are you here? Phor. I am: but why d'ye trifle? Get. Mind me then! [to Phormio. No sooner had we paid you at the Forum, But we return'd directly home again. —Arriv'd, my master sends me to your wife. [to Antipho. Ant. For what? Get. No matter now, good Antipho. I was just entering the women's lodging, Gynæceum; from the Greek ??????????, ?????? understood. The Gynæceum was an interior part of the house appropriated to the women. Westerhovius. When up runs little Mida; catches me Hold by the cloak behind, and pulls me back. I turn about, and ask why he detains me. He told me, “Nobody must see his mistress: “For Sophrona, says he, has just now brought “Demipho's brother, Chremes, here; and He “Is talking with the women now within.” —When I heard this, I stole immediately On tip-toe tow'rds the door; came close; stood hush; Drew in my breath; applied my ear; and thus, Deep in attention, catch'd their whole discourse. Ant. Excellent, Geta! Get. Here I overheard The pleasantest adventure!—On my life, I scarce refrain'd from crying out for joy. Ant. What? Get. What d'ye think? [laughing. Ant. I can't tell. Get. Oh! it was [laughing. Most wonderful!—most exquisite!—your uncle Is found to be the father of your wife. Ant. How! what? Get. He had a sly intrigue, it seems, With Phanium's mother formerly at Lemnos. [laughing. Phor. Nonsense! as if she did not know her father! Get. Nay, there's some reason for it, Phormio, You may be sure.—But was it possible For me, who stood without, to comprehend Each minute circumstance that past within? Ant. I have heard something of this story too. In all the editions which I have seen, Bentley's excepted, this speech is put into Phormio's mouth: but that learned Critick tells us it is attributed to Antipho in a copy at Cambridge. I am sure it is very improper for Phormio, who had just before said, Nonsense! as if she did not know her father! Cooke. Get. Then, Sir, to settle your belief the more, At last out comes your uncle; and soon after Returns again, and carries in your father. Then they both said, they gave their full consent, That you should keep your Phanium.—In a word, I'm sent to find you out, and bring you to them. Ant. Away with me then instantly! D'ye linger? Quin ergo rape me. Cessas? Antipho is so rejoiced at Geta's news, that he jumps upon his shoulders, and is carried off in triumph. This was a sort of stage-trick, and was extremely diverting to the audience. Dacier. I believe Madam Dacier has not the least foundation for this extraordinary piece of information; and I must confess that I have too high an opinion both of the Roman Audience and Actors to believe it to be true. Get. Not I. Away! Ant. My Phormio, fare you well! Phor. Fare you well, Antipho. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. PHORMIO alone. Well done, 'fore heaven! Gaudes, &amp;c. Pro gaudeo Guyetus Plaudite: &amp; scenas sequentes spurias esse pronuntiat; neminemque, siquidem sanus fuerit, a se dissensurum putat. Credasne hunc hominem sanæ tum mentis fuisse,cum hæc effutiret? certe ad Anticyras relegandus tum erat; non nunc argumentis refutandus. Nihil in toto Terentio sequentibus scenis pulchrius, venustius, urbanius, moratius: sine quibus reliqua fabula, quæ nulli cedit, ex fulgore in fumum exiret. Bentley. See the last note to the fifth act. I'm overjoy'd to see so much good fortune Fallen thus unexpectedly upon them: I've now an admirable opportunity To bubble the old gentlemen, and ease Phædria of all his cares about the money; So that he need not be oblig'd to friends. For this same money, tho' it will be given, Will yet come from them much against the grain; But I have found a way to force them to't. —Now then I must assume a grander air, And put another face upon this business. —I'll hence awhile into the next bye-alley, And pop upon them, as they're coming forth. —As for the trip I talk'd of to the Fair, I sha'n't pretend to take that journey now. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. I have divided what is commonly received as the fifth act into two, nor is there any other way of removing the flagrant absurdity in the old division of this play, except doing the same thing by the first act, which is the method followed by Echard, who in his translation concludes the first act with the parting of Davus and Geta; and it must not be dissembled, that Donatus lays out the play in the same manner. But in a Comedy so full of action (tota motoria, as Donatus calls it) it is surely needless to make the first act consist entirely of narration, like the meagre Step-Mother. In the division here observed, I have endeavoured to assign a particular portion of the business of the play to each act. The first contains the previous circumstances related by Geta, and the return of Demipho. The second contains the conference of Phormio and Demipho, the consultation of the lawyers, and the altercation between Dorio and Phædria. In the third, as it ought, the situation of affairs becomes more critical: Chremes returns; we find that the old gentlemen had particular reasons to be uneasy at the marriage of Antipho; this naturally paves the way for their being bubbled by Phormio and Geta; and the act closes with the discovery of Phanium by Chremes. The fourth act communicates that discovery, in a very pleasant manner, to Demipho, and by another way, equally entertaining, to Geta, Phormio, &amp;c. The fifth contains the endeavour of the old men to recover their money, which effort very naturally produces the catastrophe, that betrays the whole secret to all the parties interested in the event. I hope it is needless to observe, that Phormio's retiring in order to wait for the coming forth of the old men, leaves the stage vacant, where I have ended the fourth act, and forms a proper interval between that act and the fifth. SCENE I. Enter DEMIPHO and CHREMES—and soon after, on t'other side, PHORMIO. Dem. Well may we thank the gracious Gods, good brother, That all things have succeeded to our wish. —But now let's find out Phormio with all speed, Before he throws away our Thirty Minæ. Phor. pretending not to see them.] l'll go and see if Demipho's at home, That I may— Dem. meeting him.] —We are coming to you, Phormio. Phor. On the old score, I warrant. Dem. Ay. Phor. I thought so. —Why should you go to Me?—Ridiculous! Was you afraid I'd break my contract with you? No, no! how great soe'er my poverty, I've always shewn myself a man of honour. Chre. (apart) Has not she, as I said, a liberal air? One cannot conceive any thing more happy or just than these words of Chremes. Demipho's thoughts are wholly taken up how to recover the money, and Phormio is equally sollicitous to retain it; but Chremes, who had just left his daughter, is regardless of their discourse, and, fresh from the impressions which she had made on him, longs to know if his Brother's sentiments of her were equally favourable, and naturally puts this paternal question to him. Patrick. Dem. (apart) She has. Phor. —And therefore I was coming, Demipho, To let you know, I'm ready to receive My wife whene'er you please. For I postpon'd All other business, as indeed I ought, Soon as I found ye were so bent on this. Dem. Ay, but my brother has dissuaded me From going any further in this business. “For how will people talk of it?” says he: “At first you might have done it handsomely; “But then you'd not consent to it; and now, “After co-habitation with your son, “To think of a divorce, is infamous.” —In short, he urg'd almost the very things, That you so lately charg'd me with yourself. Phor. You trifle with me, Gentlemen. Dem. How so? Phor. How so?—Because I cannot marry t'other, With whom I told you I was first in treaty. For with what face can I return to Her, Whom I have held in such contempt? Chre. Tell him, Antipho does not care to part with her. [prompting Demipho. Dem. And my son too don't care to part with her: —Step to the Forum then, and give an order Argentum jube rursum rescribi. Scribere, rescribere, perscribere, were technical terms in use among merchants and bankers: scribere is, to borrow money; rescribere, to repay it; perscribere, to employ it on your own occasions. And all those dealings were carried on then, as they are now, with us, by Draughts, Bills of Exchange, &amp;c. Dancier. For the repayment of our money, Phormio. Phor. What! when I've paid it to my creditors? Dem. What's to be done then? Phor. Give me but the wife, To whom you have betroth'd me, and I'll wed her. But if you'd rather she shou'd stay with you, The portion stays with Me, good Demipho. For 'tis not just, I should be bubbled by you; When, to retrieve your honour, I've refus'd Another woman with an equal fortune. Dem. A plague upon your idle vapouring, You vagabond!—D'ye fancy we don't know you? You, and your fine proceedings? Phor. You provoke me. Dem. Why, would you marry her, if proffer'd? Phor. Try me. Dem. What! that my son my keep her privately At your house?—That was your intention. Phor. Ha! What say you, Sir? Dem. Give me my money, sirrah! Phor. Give me my wife, I say. Dem. To justice with him! Phor. To justice? Now, by heaven, Gentlemen, If you continue to be troublesome— Dem. What will you do? Phor. What will I do? Perhaps, You think that I can only patronize Girls without portion; but be sure of this, I've some with portions too. Etiam dotatis soleo. Donatus explain these words, as alluding to Nausistrata; others suppose that Phormio confines his thoughts to no particular instance; but I think it is plain from the sequel, as well as the general tenor of the scene, that Phormio still keeps Phanium in his eye; and expresses himself obscurely in this place, because the old men were not yet aware of the intelligence he had received on that head, tho' every subsequent speech leads gradually to an explanation, tends to create an open rupture between him and the old gentlemen, and brings on the final discovery to Nausistrata. Chre. What's that to Us? Phor. Nothing.—I know a lady here, whose husband.— [carelessly. Chre. Ha! Dem. What's the matter? Phor. —Had another wife At Lemnos. Chre. to aside.] I'm a dead man. Phor. —By which other He had a daughter; whom he now brings up In private. Chre. aside.] Dead and buried! Phor. This I'll tell her. [going towards the house. Chre. Don't, I beseech you! Phor. Oh! are you the man? Dem. Death! how insulting! Chre. to Phormio.] We discharge you. Phor. Nonsense! Chre. What wou'd you more? The money you have got, We will forgive you. Phor. Well; I hear you now. —But what a plague d'ye mean by fooling thus, Acting and talking like mere children with me? —I won't; I will:—I will; I won't again:— Give, take; say, unsay; do, and then undo. Chre. to Demipho.] Which way cou'd he have learnt this? Dem. I don't know: But I am sure I never mention'd it. Chre. Good now! amazing! Phor. I have ruffled them. [aside. Dem. What! shall he carry off so large a sum, The different characters of the two brothers are admirably preserved throughout this scene. Chremes stands greatly in awe of his wife, and will submit to any thing, rather than the story should come to her ears: But Demipho cannot brook the thoughts of losing so much money, and encourages his brother to behave with spirit and resolution, promising to make up matters between him and his wife. Patrick. And laugh at us so openly?—By heaven, I'd rather die.—Be of good courage, brother! Pluck up the spirit of a man! You see This slip of your's is got abroad; nor can you Keep it a secret from your wife. Now therefore 'Tis more conducive to your peace, good Chremes, That we should fairly tell it her ourselves, Than she should hear the story from another. And then we shall be quite at liberty To take our own revenge upon this rascal. Phor. Ha!—If I don't take care, I'm ruin'd still. They're growing desperate, and Hi gladiatorio animo ad me affectant viam. Alluding to the Gladiators. making tow'rds me, With a determin'd gladiatorial air. Chre. to Demipho.] I fear, she'll ne'er forgive me. Dem. Courage, Chremes! I'll reconcile her to't; especially The mother being dead and gone. Phor. Is this Your dealing, Gentlemen? You come upon me Extremely cunningly—But, Demipho, You have but ill consulted for your brother, To urge me to extremities.—And you, Sir, [to Chremes. When you have play'd the whore-master abroad; Having no reverence for your lady here, A woman of condition; wronging her After the grossest manner; come you now To wash away your crimes with mean submission? No.—I will kindle such a flame in her, As, tho' you melt to tears, you sha'n't extinguish. Dem. A plague upon him! was there ever man So very impudent?—A knave! he ought To be transported at the publick charge Into some desert. Chre. I am so confounded, I know not what to do with him. Dem. I know. Bring him before a judge! Phor. Before a judge? A Lady-judge; in here, Sirs, if you please. Dem. In consequence of this line, most of the translations introduce the servants here; but I think the scuffle between Phormio and the old men would be much more comick in the representation without the intervention of servants: And it is remarkable that Phormio addresses himself solely to Demipho and Chremes, and that the imperatives used by themselves also are all in the singular number, and may therefore most naturally be supposed to be addressed to each other, while in conflict with Phormio, without the aid of servants—Rape hunc—Os opprime—Pugnos in ventrem ingere—&amp;c. Run you, and hold him, while I call the servants. Chre. I cannot by myself: come up, and help me. Phor. I have an action of assault against you. [to Demipho. Chre. Bring it! Phor. Another against you too, Chremes! Dem. Drag him away! [both lay hold of him. Phor. struggling.] Is that your way with me! Then I must raise my voice.—Nausistrata! Come hither. Chre. Stop his mouth! Dem. struggling.] A sturdy rogue! How strong he is! Phor. struggling.] Nausistrata, I say. Nausistrata! Chre. struggling.] Peace, sirrah! Phor. Peace, indeed! Dem. Unless he follows, strike him in the stomach! Phor. Ay, or put out an eye!—But here comes one Will give me full revenge upon you both. SCENE II. To them NAUSISTRATA. Nau. Who calls for me? Chre. Confusion! Nau. to Chremes.] Pray, my dear, What's this disturbance? Phor. Dumb, old Truepenny! Nau. Who is this man?—Why don't you answer me? [to Chremes. Phor. He answer you! He's hardly in his senses. Chre. Never believe him! Phor. Do but go, and touch him; He's in a shivering fit, I'll lay my life. Chre. Nay— Nau. But what means he then? Phor. I'll tell you, Madam; Do but attend! Chre. Will you believe him then? Nau. What is there to believe, when he says nothing? Phor. Poor man! his fear deprives him of his wits. Nau. to Chremes.] I'm sure, you're not so much afraid for nothing. Chre. What! I afraid? [endeavouring to take heart. Phor. Oh, not at all!—And since You're in no fright, and what I say means nothing, Tell it yourself. Dem. At your desire, you rascal? Phor. Oh, you've done rarely for your brother, Sir! This is commonly translated, “that it is no wonder, that you defend your brother:” but it is a more insulting speech of Phormio, alluding to the miserable condition, to which Chremes was reduced by Demipho's advice. Thus, in the foregoing scene, Phormio says, much in the same spirit, —But, Demipho, You have but ill consulted for your brother, To urge me to extremities.— Nau. What! won't you tell me, husband? Chre. But— Nau. But what? Chre. There's no occasion for it. Phor. Not for You: But for the Lady there is much occasion. In Lemnos— Chre. Ha! what say you? Dem. to Phor.] Hold your peace! Phor. Without your knowledge— Chre. Oh dear! Phor. He has had Another wife. Nau. My husband? Heaven forbid! Phor. 'Tis even so. Nau. Ah me! I am undone. Phor. —And had a daughter by her there; while You Was left to sleep in ignorance alone. Nau. Oh heavens!—Baseness!—Treachery! Phor. 'Tis fact. Nau. Was ever any thing more infamous? When they're with Us, their wives forsooth, they're old. —Demipho, I appeal to You: for Him I cannot bear to speak to,—And were these His frequent journies, and long stay at Lemnos? Was this the cheapness that reduc'd our rents? Dem. That he has been to blame, Nausistrata, I don't deny; but not beyond all pardon. Phor. You're talking to the dead. Dem. It was not done Out of aversion, or contempt to You. In liquor, almost fifteen years ago, He met this woman, whence he had this daughter; Nor e'er had commerce with her from that hour. She's dead: your only grievance is remov'd. Wherefore I beg you'd shew your wonted goodness, And bear it patiently. Nau. How! bear it patiently? Alas, I wish his vices might end here. But have I the least hope? Can I suppose That years will cure these rank offences in him? Ev'n at that time he was already old, If age could make him modest.—Are my years, And beauty, think ye, like to please him more At present, Demipho, than formerly? —In short, what ground, what reason to expect That he should not commit the same hereafter? Phor. loud.] Whoever would attend the funeral Exsequias Chremeti, &amp;c. What creates the drollery of this speech is, that Phormio here makes use of the same terms, which it was customary to use at the proclamation of Funerals—L. Titio exsequias ire cui commodum est, jam tempus est, ollus defertur. Of Chremes, now's the time!—See! That's my way. Come on then! Provoke Phormio now, who dares! Like Chremes, he shall fall a victim to me. Mactatum infortunis. There is an elegant humour in the combination of these words; mactatum being a term used at sacrifices. —Let him get into favour, when he will! I've had revenge sufficient. She has something To ring into his ears his whole life long. Nau. Have I deserv'd this?—Need I, Demipho, Number up each particular; and say How good a wife I've been? Dem. I know it all. Nau. Am I then justly treated? Dem. Not at all. But since reproaches can't undo what's done, Forgive him! He begs pardon; owns his fault; And promises to mend.—What wou'd you more? Phor. But hold; before she ratifies his pardon, I must secure myself and Phædria. [aside. —Nausistrata, a word!—Before you give Your answer rashly, hear me! Nau. What's your pleasure? Phor. I trick'd your husband there of Thirty Minæ, Which I have giv'n your son; and he has paid them To a procurer for a mistress. Chre. How! What say you? Nau. Is it such a heinous crime, For your young son, d'ye think, to have one mistress, While you have two wives?—Are you not asham'd? Have you the face to chide him? Answer me! Dem. He shall do ev'ry thing you please. Nau. Nay, nay, To tell you plainly my whole mind at once, I'll not forgive, nor promise any thing, Nor give an answer, till I see my son. Phor. Wisely resolv'd, Nausistrata. Nau. Is That Sufficient satisfaction for you? Phor. Quite. I rest contented, well-pleas'd, past my hopes. Nau. What is your name, pray? Phor. My name? Phormio: A faithful friend to all your family, Especially to Phædria. Nau. Trust me, Phormio, I'll do you all the service in my power. Phor. I'm much oblig'd to you. Nau. You're worthy on't. Phor. Will you then even now, Nausistrata, Grant me one favour, that will pleasure me, And grieve your husband's sight? Nau. With all my soul. Phor. Ask me to supper! Nau. I invite you. Dem. In then! Nau. We will. But where is Phædria, our judge? Phor. He shall be with you.—[To the audience, These three last scenes [the same that compose the fifth act in this translation] are perhaps the most beautiful of any in the Phormio; yet Guyetus has declared such a cruel war against them, that he cuts them off at one stroke, without giving quarter to so much as a single verse: but it is impossible not to say, that this is rather the disgust of a sick man, than the wholesome delicacy of a judicious critick. Dacier. This remark of Madam Dacier is as just as it is elegant, and the false delicacy of Guyetus is as inconsistent as it is ill founded. For if he considered these scenes as superfluous, those, which here compose the fourth act, are superfluous also; and the play should end with the interview between Chremes and Sophrona; for when Phanium is discovered to be his daughter, nobody can doubt of her being permitted to remain the wife of Antipho, since it is the very thing which the two old gentlemen were labouring to bring about. But the truth is, that Terence in this play has displayed an address something similar to that observed by Mons. Diderot in the Self-Tormentor; for though Chremes has discovered his daughter himself, yet he is particularly anxious to conceal that incident from every personage in the Comedy, except Demipho; and the gradual unfolding that circumstance to all the other characters of the play gives the poet an opportunity of continuing his piece with all that humour and pleasantry, with which we see he has accomplished it: and his uncommon art in thus adding to the interest of his Comedy, instead of suffering it to languish, after so important a discovery, is worthy our particular observation. These scenes have indeed generally procured our poet the approbation of the severest criticks. Bentley, in the last note to the fourth act, speaks of them in the handsomest terms, and is so far from endeavouring to bring them within “the proscribing hook,” that he declares Guyetus to be an absolute madman for his unmerciful sentence of amputation. But though there are few readers, who would not on this occasion concur in the opinion of Bentley and Dacier, yet I do not think that this Comedy has in general received the encomiums it deserves. The plot indeed, being double, is so far faulty; and the story of Phanium and Antipho would certainly of itself afford sufficient materials for a Comedy, without the episode of Phædria and the Musick-Girl. It must however be acknowledged that, allowing that episode, the construction of the fable is extremely artful, and contains a vivacity of intrigue perhaps even superior to that of the Eunuch, particularly in the Catastrophe. The diction is pure and elegant, and the first act as chastly written as that of the Self-Tormentor itself. The character of Phormio is, as Donatus has observed, finely separated from that of Gnatho, and is, I think, better drawn than that of any Parasite in Plautus. Nausistrata is a lively sketch of a shrewish wife, as well as Chremes an excellent draught of an hen-pecked husband, and more in the stile of the modern drama than perhaps any character in antient comedy, except the Miser of Plautus. On the whole, if Terence copied as closely from his original in this play, as he is supposed to have done in the four which he drew from Menander, it must give us no mean opinion of the dramatick merits of Apollodorus. Moliere has given us a contemptible travestie of this excellent comedy in his miserable farce of Les Fourberies de Scapin, “The Cheats of Scapin.” It would be too injurious to the memories both of Terence and Moliere to enter into any particular comparison between the two pieces. I shall therefore conclude these notes with the well-known lines of Boileau. Etudiez la cour, et connoissez la ville: L'une &amp; l' autre toujours en modeles fertile. C'est par là que Moliere illustrant ses ecrits, Peut-être de son Art eut remporté le prix; Si moins ami du peuple, en ses doctes peintures, Il n'eut point fait souvent grimacer ses figures; Quittè pour le bouffon, l'agreable &amp; le fin, Et sans honte a Terence alliè Tabarin. Dans ce sac ridicule, ou Scapin s'envelope, Je ne reconnois plus l'Auteur du Misanthrope. Art Poetique, Chant troisieme. Farewell; Clap your hands! THE END.</field>
