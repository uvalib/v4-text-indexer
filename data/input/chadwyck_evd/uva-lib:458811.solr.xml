      <field name="fulltext">A MASQVE OF HER MAIESTIES. LOVE FREED FROM Ignorance and Folly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So soone as the Kings Maiestie was set, and in expectation, there was heard a strange Musique of wilde Instruments. To which a Sphynx came forth dauncing, leading Love bound. Sphynx leading Love bound. By this Sphynx was vnderstood Ignor?ce, who is a waies the enemie of Loue, &amp; Beauty, and lyes still in wait to entrap them. For which, Antiquitie hath giuen her the vpper parts, and face of a woman: the nether parts of a Lion, the wings of an Eagle to shew her fiercenesse, &amp; swiftnesse to euill, where shee hath power. Come sir Tyranne lordly Love, You that awe the gods aboue, As their creatures, here below, With the scepter, call'd your bow; And doe all their forces beare In the quiuer, that you weare, Whence no sooner you doe draw Forth a shaft, but is a law: Now, they shall not need to tremble, When you threaten, or dissemble, Any more; And, though you see Whom to hurt, you ha' not free Will, to act your rage. The bands Of your eyes, now tye your hands. All the Triumphs, all the spoiles Gotten by your artes, and toiles, Ouer foe, and ouer friend, O're your mother, here must end. And you, now, that thought to lay The world wast, must be my pray. Love. Cruell Sphynx, I rather striue How to keepe the world aliue, And vphold it; without mee, All againe would Chaos bee. Tell me, Monster, what should moue Thy despight, thus, against Love? Is there nothing faire, and good, Nothing bright, but burns thy blood? Still, thou art thy selfe, and made All of practice, to inuade Clearest bosomes. Hath this place None will pittie Cvpids case? Some soft eye, (while I can see Who it is, that melts for mee) Weepe a fit. Are all eyes here Made of marble? But a teare, Though a false one; It may make Others true compassion take. I would tell you all the storie If I thought you could be sorie. And, in truth, thers none haue reason, Like your selues, to hate the treason. For it practis'd was on beautie, Vnto whom Love owes all dutie. Let your fauour but affright Sphynx here, I shall soone recite Euery passage, how it was. Sphynx. Doe, Ile laugh, or cry alas. Thinks, poore Love, can Ladies lookes Saue him fr? the Sphynxes hookes? Love. No, but these can witnesse beare Of my candor, when they heare What thy malice is; or, how I became thy captiue now: And it is no small content; Falling, to fall innocent. Know, then, all you Glories here, In the vtmost East there were Eleuen Daughters of the morne. Ne're were brighter Beuy borne, Nor more perfect beauties seene. The eldest of them was the Queene Of the Orient, and 'twas sed, That shee should with PhÅbus wed. For which high-vouchsafed grace, He was lou'd of all their race. And they would, when he did rise Doe him earely sacrifice Of the rich, and purest gumme, That from any plant could come; And would looke at him as farre As they could discerne his carre: Grieuing, that they might not euer See him; and when night did seuer Their aspects, they sate and wept Till he came, and neuer slept: In so much, that at the length This their feruour gate such strength, As they would a iourney proue, By the guard, and ayde of Love, Hither to the farthest West: Where, they heard, as in the East, He a Palace, no lesse bright, Had, to feast in euery night With the Ocean, where he rested Safe, and in all state inuested. I, that neuer left the side Of the faire, became their guide. But behold, no sooner landing The meaning of this is, that these Ladies being the perfect issue of Beautie, and all worldly grace, were carried by Loue to celebrate the Maiestie, and wisdome of the King, figur'd in the Sunne, and seated in these extreme parts of the world; where they were rudely receiued by Ignorance, on their first approach, to the hazard of their affection, it being her nature to hinder all noble actions; but that the Loue which brought them thither, was not willing to forsake them, no more then they were to abandon it, yet was it enough perplex'd, in that the monster ignorance still couets, to enwrap it selfe in darke, and obscure tearmes, and betray that way, whereas true loue affects to expresse it selfe, with all clearenesse, and simplicitie.On this Ile, but this commanding Monster Sphynx, the enemy Of all actions great, and high, Knowing, that these rites were done To the wisdome of the sunne, From a cliffe surpriz'd them all. And, though I did humbly fall At her lions feete, and pray'd As shee had the face of mayd, That shee would compassion take Of these ladies, for whose sake Love would giue himselfe vp; shee, Swift to euill, as you see By her wings, and hooked hands, First did take my offred bands Then, to prison of the night, Did condemne those sisters bright, There, for euer to remaine, 'Lesse they could the knot vn-straine Of a riddle, which shee put Darker, then where they'are shut: Or, from thence, their freedomes proue With the vtter losse of Love. They vnwilling to forego One, who had deserued so Of all beautie, in their names, Were content to haue their flames Hid in lasting night, e're I Should for them vntimely die. I, on th'other side as glad That I such aduantage had To assure them mine, engag'd Willingly my selfe, and wag'd With the monster, that if I Did her riddle not vntie, I would freely giue my life To redeeme them, and the strife. Sphynx. Ha'you said, Sir? will you try, Now, your knowne dexterity? You presume, vpon your artes, Of tying, and vntying hearts: And it makes you confident, But, anone, you will repent. Love. No, Sphynx, I do not presume, But some little heart assume From my Iudges heere, that sit As they would not loose Love yet. Sphynx. You are pleasant, Sir, 'tis good. Love. Love do's often change his mood. Sphynx. I shall make you sad agen. Love. I shall be the sorier, then. Sphynx. Come, Sir, lend it your best eare. Love. I begin t'haue halfe a feare. Sphynx. First, Cupid, you must cast about To find a world the world without, Wherein what's done, the eie doth doe; And is the light, and treasure too. This eye still moues, and still is fixed, And in the powers thereof are mixed Two contraries; which time, till now, Nor Fate knew where to ioyne, or how. Yet, if you hit the right vpon, You must resolue these, all, by on. Love. Sphynx, you are too quick of tongue: Say't againe, and take me'along. Sphynx. I say, you first must cast about To finde a world, the world without. Love. I say, that is alreadie done, And is the new world i'the Moone. Sphynx. Cupid, you doe cast too farre; This world is neerer by a starre. So much light Ile giue you to'it. Love. Without a Glasse? Well, I shall do't. Your world's a Lady, then, each creature Humane, is a world in feature. Is it not? Sphynx. Yes, but finde out A world you must, the world without. Love. Why, if her seruant be not here, She doth a single world appeare Without her world. Sphynx. Well, you shall runne. Love. Nay, Sphynx, thus far is wel begunne. Sphynx. Wherein what's done, the eye doth doe, And is the light, and treasure too. Love. That's cleare as light; for wherein lies A Ladies power, but in her eyes? And not alone her grace, and power, But oftentimes, her wealth, and dower. Sphynx. I spake but of an eye, not eyes. Love. A one eyd Mistresse that vnties. Sphynx. This eye still moues, and still is fixed. Love. A rolling eye, that, natiue there, Yet throwes her glaunces euery where; And, being but single, faine would doo The offices, and artes of two. Sphynx. And in the powers thereof are mixed Two contraries. Love. That's smiles, and teares, Or fire, and frost; For either beares Resemblance apt. Sphynx. Which time, till now, Nor Fate knew where to ioyne, or how. How now Cvpid? at a stay? Not another word, to say? Doe you finde by this, how long You haue beene at a fault, and wrong? Love. Sphynx, it is your pride, to vexe Whome you deale with, and perplexe Things most easie: Ignorance Thinkes she doth her selfe aduance, If of problemes cleare, shee make Riddles, and the sense forsake, Which came gentle from the Muses, Till her vttring, it abuses. Sphynx. Nay, your rayling will not saue you: Cvpid, I of right must haue you. Come my fruitfull issue forth, Dance, and shew a gladnesse, worth Such a captiue, as is Love, And your mothers triumph proue. The Follies dance, which were the twelue shee-fooles. Sphynx. Now, This shewes, that Loues expositions are not alway serious, till it be diuinely instructed; and that sometimes it may be in the danger of Ignorance and Folly, who are the mother, and issue: for no folly but is borne of ignorance. go take him vp, &amp; beare him To the cliffe, where I wil teare him Peece-meale, and giue each a part Of his raw, and bleeding heart. Love. Ladies, haue your lookes no power To helpe Love, at such an hower? Will you loose him thus? adiew, Thinke, what will become of you, Who shall praise you, who admire, Who shall whisper, by the fire As you stand, soft tales, who bring you Prettie newes, in rimes who sing you. Who shall bathe him in the streames Of your blood, and send you dreames Of delight. Sphynx. Away, goe beare him Hence, they shall no longer heare him. The Muses Priests: their number twelue: their song, to a measure. Gentle Here is vnderstood the power of wisdome in the Muses ministers, by which name al that haue the spirit of prophesie are stil'd, and such they are that need to encounter Ignorance, and Folly: and are euer readie to assist Loue in any action of honor, and vertue, and inspire him with their owne soule. Love, be not dismay'd. See, the Muses pure, and holy, By their Priests haue sent thee ayde Against this brood of Folly. It is true, that Sphynx their dame Had the sense first from the Muses, Which in vttring shee doth lame, Perplexeth, and abuses. But they bid, that thou should'st looke In the brightest face here shining, And the same, as would a booke, Shall helpe thee in diuining. Love. 'Tis done, 'tis done. I haue found it out, Britayne's the world, the world without. The King's the eye, as we do call The sunne the eye of this great all. And is the light and treasure too; For 'tis his wisdome all doth doo. Which still is fixed in his brest, Yet still doth moue to guide the rest. The Contraries which Time till now Nor Fate knew where to ioyne, or how Are maiestie, and Love; which there, And no where els, haue their true sphear. Now Sphynx, I'haue hit the right vpon, And doe resolue these All by on: That is, that you meant Albion. Priests. 'Tis true in him, and in no other, Love, thou art cleare absolued, Vanish Follies, with your mother, The riddle is resolued. Sphynx must flie, when PhÅbus shines, And to ayde of Love enclines. Love. Appeare then you my brighter charge, And to light your selues enlarge, To behold that glorious starre, For whose loue you came so farre, While the monster, with her clues, Do prÃ¦cipitate themselues. Graces. Their Song crowning Cvpid. A crowne, a crowne for Loves bright head, Without whose happie wit All forme, and beautie had beene dead, And we had di'd with it. For what are all the graces Without good formes, and faces? Then Loue receiue the due reward Those Graces haue prepard. Cho. And may no hand, no tongue, no eie Thy merit, or their thankes enuie. A Dialogue betweene the Chorvs and the Graces. What gentle formes are these that moue To honour Loue? They are the bright and golden lights That grace his nights. And shot from Beauties eyes, They looke like faire Avroras streames, They are her fairer daughters beames, Who now doth rise. Then night is lost, or fled away For where such Beautie shines, is euer day. The Masque daunce followed. That done, one of the Priests alone sung. Prie. O what a fault, nay, what a sinne In Fate, or Fortune had it beene, So much beautie to haue lost! Could the world with all her cost Haue redeem'd it? Cho. No, no, no. Prie. How so? Cho. It would Nature quite vndoe, For losing these, you lost her too. The Measures and Reuells follow. Then another of the Priests alone. How neere to good is what is faire! Which we no sooner see, But with the liues, and outward aire Our senses taken be. We wish to see it still, and proue, What waies wee may deserue, We court, we praise, we more then loue. We are not grieu'd to serue. The last Masque-daunce. And after it, this full Song. What iust excuse had aged Time, His wearie limbes now to haue eas'd, And sate him downe without his crime, While euery thought was so much pleas'd! But he so greedie to deuoure His owne, and all that hee brings forth, Is eating euery piece of houre Some obiect of the rarest worth. Yet this is rescued from his rage, As not to die by time, or age. For beautie hath a liuing name, And will to heauen, from whence it came. The going out. Now, now. Gentle Loue is free, and Beautie blest With the sight it so much long'd to see. Let vs the Muses Priests, and Graces goe to rest, For in them our labours happie bee. Then, then, angry Musique sound, and teach our feet, How to moue in time, and measure meet: Thus should the Muses Priests, and Graces goe to rest, Bowing to the Sunne, throned in the West.</field>
