Kinge Roboam. Go all way till the third day &amp; then returne vnto mee &amp; you shall answeare haue, The while bidd the Auncients of Israell to me repayre wt h out delay, for I would haue their counsell People of Israel Wee will my liege do your command, &amp; that wt h out delay King Roboam. So do. Lo now they are at hand, I'l heare what they will say. Auncients you welcome are, who did assist before my father while he was liuinge: your counsel now I craue what I shall answeare vnto the people who desyre to haue the burden eased where wt h before (as they affirme) my father them oppressed Auncients of Israel. Yf you my gratious lord will grante the people their desyre &amp; geue them gentle words they'l serue you as they seru'd your father. Kinge Roboam. Well stand a-syde, &amp; lett me heare what these yonge men will say who wayted haue on mee, &amp; bene brought vp wt h me alway. Yonge men of Israel. This answeare to them make (renowned kinge) my litle finger shall grosser bee (assure your selues) then the backe of my father. My father on you layd a heauy yoke: But I will adde more there vnto. Wt h scourges you were by my father pay'd but I wt h Scorpions will you beate. This answeare to them make Kinge Roboam I your advises both haue heard, &amp; what answeare I'l make when the third day ys come shall playnly to you all appeare so let's be gone, &amp; wt h the multitude then meete me here. Good people you are come yt seemes of me to haue an answeare, &amp; so you shall. My fathers heauy yoke I will make heauier Hee beate you but wt h whipps, But I wt h scorpions will you pay &amp; the proud'st of you make to stoupe: Let's see who dares say nay People of Israel What part haue we in Dauid, or Inheritance in the sonne of Isai? Israel come, vnto our Tabernacles let's be gone. Kinge Roboam. Doe only the two tribes of Beniamin &amp; Iuda stay wt h mee? Then to Ierusalem I'l be gone wt h out delay. Nuncius When to Hierusalem Roboam came kinge he was crowned of Iuda only, for from hym all Israel was revolted. And of the Tribes of Beniamin &amp; Iuda he did gather an hundred fourscore thousand chosen fightinge men to gether to fight agaynst the house of Israel, &amp; to reduce the kingdome from them wholly vnto hym selfe beinge the sonne of Salomon. And Israel understandinge that Ieroboam was returned from Ãgipt, hym wt h ioynt consent the kinge of Israell crowned. But the word of our lord forth wt h vnto Roboam came by one that was a man of god Semeias cald by name &amp; did forbidd hym for to fight agaynst the house of Israel: &amp; euery man returned home, &amp; wt h them woulde not medle. Yet Ieroboam was persua'ed that kingdome would returne vnto the house of Dauid yf the people should go vp vnto Hierusalem there for to offer sacrifice in the house of our lord, where fore he forth wt h did devise two golden calues, &amp; sayd: Israel go no more to Hierusalem Lo here thy gods that brought the out of Ãgipt are: adore them And one of them in Bethel he did sett, the other in Dan wc h to adore great multitudes of people dayly ran. And in th'Excelses he made Temples, &amp; of the meanest people priestes that were not of Leuis stocke, &amp; an Altar in Bethel to immolate on the same vnto the calues wc h he had framed &amp; there on also incense burnt: wc h god highly displeased And vnto Bethel came a man of god forth wt h from Iuda while he was censinge, &amp; vnto the Altar thus did say: Altar, Altar, thus sayth our lord: Behold a child shall bee borne to the house of Dauid, &amp; shall immolate vpon thee the priestes of the excelses, who now frankinsense now burne on thee: &amp; his name shall Iosias bee when he ys borne. And for a token that yt ys our lord who thus hath spoken th'Ashes shall be pour'd out on yt, &amp; th'Altar shalbe clouen. Wc h wordes when the kinge heard his hand forth from th'Altar he stretched sayinge: Take hym: &amp; his hand strecht out agaynst hym withered, &amp; the kinge could not draw yt backe: &amp; the Altar was clouen &amp; th ashes pou'red out on yt, euen as the man had spoken. Then sayd the kinge vnto the man of god: pray I beseech thee vnto our lord for me, that my hand may restored bee. &amp; the man pray'd vnto our lord, &amp; his hand was restored to hym agayne as yt was before, &amp; then the kinge requested the man of god to dyne wt h hym, wc h he denyed vtterly because he was forbidden foode there to tayst by god almighty. Though afterward he by an other prophet was deceyued &amp; eate &amp; drunke: for wc h he by a lyon was deuoured. Yet for all this Ieroboam doth perseuer in Idolatry &amp; since his sonne Abia's fallen sicke, &amp; lyke to dye And to the prophet Ahia hee hath sente his wyfe to know of hym whether his sonne shall his health agayne recouer or no. And now the prophet who ys blinde wt h age abroad ys walkinge to take the ayre ledd by his man. And the queene's also comminge in strange attyre as yt doth seeme for feare shee should be knowne. for so the kinge her bade; to them geue eare, for I'l be gone. Ahias the prophet. I heare the sounde of the queenes feete entringe in at the dore. come in Ieroboams wyfe: &amp; forth wt h lett me know where fore thou feignes thy selfe to be an other woman then thou art? A heauy message vnto thee I am for to impart. Go tell Ieroboam that thus sayth our lord the god of Israel: Because I haue exalted thee from the midst of the people &amp; ouer Israel made thee prince, &amp; from the house of Dauid the kingdome rent &amp; geuen yt thee, &amp; yet as Dauid did thou hast not my commandments kept, but yll aboue all other hast wrought makeinge strange gods &amp; there by me provok't to anger Euill vpon Ieroboams house I'l bringe, &amp; will stryke all that out of Ieroboam come pissinge agaynst the wall &amp; they that shall of hym be borne &amp; dye wt h in the citty the doggs shall eate, &amp; foules devour them that in the fieldes dye. Go therefore home, &amp; at the very entrance of thy feete in to the citty the child shall dye, &amp; all Israel mourne for yt &amp; bury hym: for only hee shall be brought to his sepulcher for yll he did preuent wc h was intended by his father And our lord shall appoynt vnto hym selfe a kinge of Israel &amp; shall Israell from the good country plucke where now they dwell &amp; stryke Ieroboams house for the synne wc h he hath committed. All this vnto Ieroboam tell wc h here I haue related So queene adew: Sirra lead me now to the place whence I came vxor Ieroboam. yt's a hard message: yet to the kinge I'l go &amp; beare the same Nuncius So soone as the queene on the threshold of the dore did enter her sonne dyed &amp; wt h mourninge Israel brought hym to his sepulcher &amp; whyle Ieroboam &amp; the queene do for their dead sonne mourne we'l to Roboam kinge of Iuda backe agayne returne who for his synne by Sesac kinge of Ãgipt ys invaded &amp; hath in Iuda lost the cittyes that were the best fenced &amp; since towardes Hierusalem ys gone wt h all his forces pursuinge kinge Roboam who's fledd thither wt h all the princes of Iuda, &amp; a prophet that Semeias hath to name ys from our lord sent for to do a message to Roboam &amp; what that ys you streight shall heare yf you will geue attention for here the prophet, kinge &amp; princes come. Now I'l begone. Semeias a prophet Princes &amp; kinge thus sayth our lord: Sith you haue me forsaken I will leaue you in Sesacs hand by hym for to be taken Kinge Roboam. Thy words haue me amaz'd Pr[i]nces. So haue they vs. Rob[oam] princ[es]. our lord is iust Semeias Syth that you humbled are agayne from god tell you I must, that he'l not you destroy, but will geue you a litle ayde &amp; on Hierusalem his wrath shall by Sesac not be layd. But yet you shall hym serue for to learne what the difference ys betwene the seruice of our lord, &amp; an earthly kings seruice Thus much our lord commanded me vnto you to declare. Kinge Roboam. &amp; Princes of Iuda. Semeias thanks: our lord ys iust &amp; we all synners are. Kinge Roboam. But now let vs begone lest sodaynly we be assaulted by Sesac who towards Hierusalem allready's marched. Nuncius Now Sesac kinge Ãgipt from Hierusalem's retyred &amp; hath much treasure from the house of god wt h hym conueyed But yet because the people humbled are before our lord they were not cleane destroy'd accordinge to the prophets worde though they in great subiection lyu'd vnto th'Ãgiptian kinge &amp; betwixt them &amp; Ieroboam there euer hath bene ierringe vntill Roboam wt h his fathers slept wc h lately happened &amp; then Ieroboams wrath towards Abias was conuerted who was Roboams sonne &amp; reigned in his fathers place but Ieroboam quickly was subdued by Abias for god so terrifye'd hym &amp; Israel that they fled away before Abias, &amp; there fell of them hurt in one day fyue hundred Thousand valiant men: And in Ieroboams place Nadab his sonne did reigne, as wicked as his father was. And when Abias kinge of Iuda dye'd Asa his sonne succeeded hym, &amp; gods laws kept euen as Dauid had done exceptinge only that th'Excelses he tooke not away wc h for his wyues salomon had made. And the kinge of Ãthiopia Who Zara had to name, &amp; his whole army (wc h conteyned ten hundred thousand men) through gods helpe were by hym destroyed. And he Maaca his owne mother from the Empyre deposed because that she to priapus an Idoll had erected, wc h he in peeces brake &amp; burnt the groue for to hym came one wt h gods spirit indue'd who Azarias had to name &amp; to hym thus did say: Heare me Asa, Iuda, &amp; Beniamin: our lord god ys wt h you because that you wt h hym haue bin. Yf you will seeke hym, you shall finde hym: But yf you do make, a smale accompt of hym, assure your selues he'l you forsake. And many days in Israel shall wt h out the true god passe &amp; wt h out priest, teacher, &amp; law, for so our lord god says. And when in their distresse they shall wt h all their heart &amp; mynde returne vnto our lord, &amp; seeke hym, then they shall hym fynde. And at that tyme there shall not bee peace to hym that doth go out &amp; come in, but on ech syde greate feare, terrour, &amp; woe in the Inhabitants of the earth: for Nation agaynst Nation shall fight: &amp; betwene citty &amp; citty there shall be great dissention because our lord will them molest wt h euery kynde of misery wherefore courage to you take for your workes shall rewarded bee Wc h wordes when Asa heard he courage tooke, &amp; putt away all th'Idolls that were in the land of Beniamin &amp; Iuda And made a lawe that euery one should our lord god seeke out wt h all their heart &amp; soule, &amp; dye ech on that sought hym not. And all the people made due search, &amp; did our lord god fynde And our lord gaue them peace agayne, &amp; quietnes of mynde, euen as the prophet of our lord before to hym did say &amp; Asa all his days a perfect heart had. But Baasa his lord Nadab by treachery slew, &amp; after Israel gouerned &amp; whyle he reignd Ieroboams house he vtterly destroyed for his synne as Ahias sayd, &amp; shortly after dyed And his sonne Ela had his place, &amp; ouer Israel reigned But by his seruant Zambri he beinge one day drunke was slayne &amp; Zambri in his place did afterwards ouer Israel reigne &amp; the house of Baasa strucke, &amp; lefte not one at all of them, as Iehu had fore told to pisse agaynst the wall. The wc h when Israel heard they Amry kinge created who general had bene of the warres, &amp; he Zambri besieged in Thersa, who perceiuinge that he must needes taken bee both hys house &amp; hym selfe he burnt &amp; in his synnes did dye. But now Israel diuided was &amp; th'one halfe followed Thebin Gineth his sonne to make hym kinge, th'other halfe did go wt h Amri But Amri did preuayle, &amp; shortly after Thebin dyed &amp; Amri ouer Israel reign'd, &amp; for wickednes exceeded all other that before hym were: And then Achab his sonne succeeded hym, &amp; lyu'd as wickedly as he had done And now the prophet Elias ys from god to Achab sentt &amp; wt h his message you shall be acquainted made incontinent yf you accordinge to your wonte a while will shew attention for here they cominge are together. And now I will begone. Elias the prophet. As the lord god of Israel lyues in whose sight I do stand for certayne yeares both dew &amp; rayne shall fall vpon the land accordinge to the wordes that shall out of my mouth proceede that thou may know our lord ys god, &amp; none other god besyde Kinge Achab. credite thee that will, for I will not, in any thinge thou dost say But I'l be gone for great occasions drawes me hence away. God Elias go thy way, &amp; in the Torrent Carith hyde thee &amp; of the Torrent thou shalt drynke when thou feeles thy selfe thyrsty. &amp; I commanded haue the rauens there thee for to feede Elias on confidence there of Lord on my iourney I'l proceede Nuncius. Elias to the Torrent Carith went as god commanded &amp; bread &amp; flesh the Rauens twice a day vnto hym caryed &amp; of the Torrent he did drynke vntill yt was vp dryed wc h wt h in certayne dayes by reason that no rayne fell, happened But then our Lord vnto hym sayd: Aryse &amp; go into Sereptha, &amp; stay there, for I commanded haue a widdow, there thee to feede, &amp; he's gone thence directly to that citty where what his entertaynment ys marke well &amp; you shall see for at the citty gate behold he wt h the widdow meeteth who gatheringe ys of stickes, &amp; her in frendly wyse Saluteth Elias Will mett good widdow: I thee beseech for to bestow vpon mee a litle water for to drynke for I am tootoe thirsty. widdowe I'l yt go fetch. Elias. A morsell to of breade bringe in thy hand for mee to eate for I am hungry. Widdow. Thus much sir vnder stand as our lord lyues I haue no breade, but one handfull of meale in a pott, &amp; a litle oyle wt h in a litle vessell And loe I gathered haue, &amp; now to make yt ready for mee &amp; my sonne goinge am that we may eate &amp; dye Elias feare not but go &amp; do as thou hast sayd: But first make for mee a litle harth cake of that meale, &amp; bringe yt hither wt h thee. And afterward then thou shalt make for thy selfe &amp; thy sonne for thus our lord doth say the pott of meale shall not be done nor the oyle vessell empty bee vntill that yt do rayne Widdow I'l then go do as you haue sayd, &amp; streight returne agayne Elias Nay rather I'l go in wt h thee so shall thou be lesse troubled Widdow Syth that you are disposed so to do I am contented. Nuncius The widdow, her house, &amp; Elias are all well refreshed &amp; yet neyther the meale nor oyle are any white diminished But now her sonne ys fallen sicke, for wc h she mourneth sore &amp; here shee bringes hym in her armes, &amp; the prophet comes before Widdow. Alas my sonne I feare ys dead: In hym no breath there ys didst thou come vnto me thou man of god that myne iniquities might be cal'd to remembrance, &amp; thou mightest my sonne kill? Elias Geue me thy sonne, &amp; hym lay downe vpon this bedd I will. O lord my god where fore hast thou this widdow thus afflicted by killinge of her sonne, who in a sort hath my lyfe saued O lord my god let the soule of this child, I do beseech thee come in to hym agayne. Now yt's returnd in to his body Widow behold thy sonne doth lyue: Geue god prayse for the same Widow I see thou art a man of god, &amp; his worde's true that came out of thy mouth, for wc h to hym be prayse for euer more. Come sonne let's in returne syth thou as well art as before. God Elias now to Achab go &amp; shewe thy selfe agayne to hym, that I vpon the face of th'earth may geue some rayne Nuncius Achab perceiueinge that there ys great famyne in Samaria hath sent the ruler of his house Abdias thence away to trye yf he any grasse can fynde, or water for his cattell wc h both are wantinge in the land where as he now doth dwell for this ys the third yeare since that Elias did vp close the heauen that yt should not rayne, for so you must suppose And Achab's gone hym selfe abroad also an other way for to seeke out some batle soyle where saue their lyues he may. And here Abdias comminge ys, as yt should seeme to mee, Whom by the way Elias meetes. Their greetinge you shall see. Abdias Who's this I here espye? My lord say art thou not Elias? Elias I am. Go tell thy lord that here Elias ys (Abdias. Abdias What's my offence that mee thy seruant thou deliuer will in to the hands of my lord Achab that hee may mee kill? No nation's in this land whither my lord hath not sent to seeke thee &amp; all haue answeare made, he ys not here. And thou says to mee Go tell thy lord here ys Elias: And when I am departed from thee, perhaps thou wilt in to some other place be caryed by the spirite of our lord, &amp; Achab sendinge for to seeke thee fynde thee not there, he haply will offended bee, &amp; kill mee. And from his infancy thy seruant hath our lord god feared. Hath yt not bene told my lord what I did when Iezabell killed the prophets of our lord, how I them hydd by fifty &amp; by fyfty in caues, &amp; fedd them all wt h water, &amp; bread, &amp; kept them safly? And thou sayst: go &amp; tell thy lord: Elias now ys here, that he may kill mee, as he will yf thou do not appeare. Elias The lord of hosts doth lyue before whose face I now am standinge I will this day to hym appeare. Abdias. Then to hym I'l be goinge. Elias So do &amp; that wt h speede, &amp; be assur'd of this Abdias yf Achab come or sende, he shall me fynde here in this place. Now syth I am here all alone, I will sitt downe &amp; rest mee but that must not be longe, for Achab's cominge here allready. Kinge Achab. Art yu he that Israel doth trouble? Elias. I have not Israel troubled but thou, &amp; the house of thy father who haue Baalim followed &amp; broken the commandments of our lord. yet not wt h standinge assemble Israel, &amp; them in mount Carmel to me bringe, &amp; Baals foure hundred fifty prophets, &amp; of the groues foure hundred wc h do at Iezabels table eate. Achab. Together they shall be called wherefore let's hence depart, &amp; in mount Carmel they shall meete thee Elias Kinge Achab do as you haue sayde &amp; there I will be ready Nuncius When Achab, Israel, &amp; the priestes were come in to mount Carmel Elias mett them there, &amp; thus did say vnto the people How longe do you halt on both sydes? yf our lord true god bee folow hym: yf Baal folow hym: And they did not reply. Vnto the people then Elias thus did say agayne: a prophet of our lord &amp; god I only do remayne. And the prophets of Baal foure hundred are &amp; fifty men. Two oxen to vs brynge, &amp; let the one by them be chosen &amp; layd beinge cutt in peeces vpon woode, &amp; no fyre vnder &amp; the other oxe shall be by mee vs'de in the selfe same maner And let them invocate the names of their gods, &amp; I'l call on the name of my god: &amp; the god that by fyre heare shall lett hym be god: And all the people sayd: A good proposition. And the priestes on the name of Baal from morninge till midday haue called sayinge: Baal heare vs: but yet nothinge would he say though they vpon the Altar lept, &amp; skipped to &amp; froe wc h when Elias did perceue, he vnto them did go &amp; sayd in iestinge wyse: perhaps your god ys not wt h in, but travaylinge ys vpon the way, or else he's in his Inne or at the least soundly a-sleepe, &amp; there fore must be waked wt h lowder cryes. And then forth wt h their voyces they exalted and cutt them selues after their rite both wt h their knyues &amp; launces till they were all imbrew'd wt h blood, &amp; lifted vp their voyces to their god Baal callinge on hym vntill the day was ended &amp; yet the oxe ordayn'd for sacrifice vnburnt remayned. Elias then th'Altar repayr'd wc h was before destroyed the wc h he of twelue stones in the name of our lord erected accordinge to the number of the Tribes of Iacobs childer &amp; round a-bout the Altar he did draw a water gutter &amp; then the woode in order plac't, &amp; th'oxe in ioynts diuided &amp; layd them on the wood, &amp; sayd: Let foure Buckets be filled wt h water, &amp; powred vpon the holocaust &amp; the woode &amp; this he made them thrise to do, while that he wt h them stoode. And the water about the Altar ranne, &amp; gutter filled &amp; so soone as the tyme was come that t'holocaust should be offered Elias sayd: Lord god of Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Israel this day declare that thou art Israels god vnto the people &amp; that I am thy seruant, &amp; haue done euen as thou bade mee in all these thinges. Heare me o lord: heare me lord I beseech thee that this people may learne that thou art god, &amp; hast conuerted their heartes agayne. And the fyre of our Lord fell &amp; deuoured the Holocaust &amp; the woode, &amp; water that was in the gutter wc h when the people saw, they fell on their faces to gether &amp; sayd: our lord he's god: our lord he's god. Then sayd Elias See that you all the prophets of Baal take, &amp; let not one passe And they forth wt h so did, &amp; brought them to ye Torrent Cison where by Elias they were kild, &amp; putt to death ech one. Elias then to Achab sayd: go vp &amp; drynke &amp; eate because there ys sound of much rayne: &amp; he went to his meate &amp; drynke. And then Elias went in to the topp of carmel &amp; putt his face betwixt his knees, &amp; flatt on the earth fell &amp; to his seruant sayd: to wardes the sea go looke, &amp; bringe me word what thou doest see: &amp; he returninge sayd there's nothing Seuen tymes then sayd Elias, to the sea returne agayne And the seuenth tyme he saw, as yt were the foote of a man, a litle clowde aryseinge from the sea. Then sayd Elias vnto Achab: Thy chariot yoke, &amp; get thee downe a pase lest the rayne the preuent. And while he turned hither &amp; thither behold the heauens darkened were, &amp; clowds began to gather &amp; the wyndes did aryse, &amp; presently great rayne there fell vpon the earth: And Achab goinge vp, went into Iezrahel And wt h Elias our lord was, &amp; his loynes beinge girded vntil he vnto Iezrahel came, before Achab he trotted. And vnto Iezabel his wyfe all things Achab related done by Elias: &amp; how all the prophets he had killed. And Iezabel vnto Elias sent one that did say to hym these thinges Let the gods do to me, &amp; these add thay yf this same houre to morrow I do not make thy soule to bee as one of their soules ys: wc h made Elias forth wt h flee. for feare to wardes the Desert, &amp; as yt seemes here he's cominge to whom I wishe you to geue eare, for now I must be goinge. Elias Syth I no better then my fathers am vnder this tree of Iunipre I'l lye &amp; sleepe desyrous for to dye. Angel. Elias ryse &amp; eate. Elias. Behold here ys set at my heade a botel full of water, &amp; lykewyse harth baked breade I'l eate, &amp; drynke, &amp; sleepe agayne as I before did do Angel. Aryse &amp; eate for thou hast yet a great way for to go Elias. I'l eate &amp; drynke as I am bidden. Now I am well refreshed I'l on my iourney go, as by our lord I shall be guyded. In the strength of the meate wc h in the desert I lately taysted I fourty days &amp; fourty nights towards Horeb haue walked the mount of god, whither beinge come I in this caue will stay God Where fore Elias stays thou there? Elias. Wt h zeale I haue alway bene zelous for our lord the god of hosts because the children of Israel haue thy Altars spoyld, &amp; couenant forsaken. &amp; wt h the sword thy prophets slayne, And lefte alone am I &amp; they do also ly in wayte to take my lyfe from mee God Come forth &amp; stand before our lord in the dore of the caue Elias Behold lord here I am. God. what hearest thou? Elias. Wt h zeale I haue bene zelous for our lord the god of hosts because the children of Israel haue thy Altars spoyled, &amp; couenant forsaken &amp; wt h the sworde thy prophets slayne, &amp; lefte alone am I &amp; they do also lye in wayte to take my lyfe from mee. God Go by the Desert of Damascus backe in to thy way &amp; beinge thither come Hazael anoynt kinge ouer Syria &amp; ouer Israel kinge anoynt Iehu the sonne of Nansi &amp; Eliseus (who's the sonne of Saphat) prophet for thee And yt shall be that who so euer the sword of Hazael shall escape, by Iehu shall be slayne. And he that shall not fall by Iehus sword hym shall Eliseus kill: And I'l in Israel leaue me seuen thousand men who haue not bow'd their knees to Baal. Now thou dost know my mynde, be gone &amp; see yt be Performed. Elias So soone as I meete wt h them lord I'l do all thou commanded Nuncius Elias hath Eliseus found, &amp; wt h his mantell hild hym as he wt h twelue yoke of oxen was plughinge in ye field Who forth wt h lefte his oxen &amp; after Elias ran sayinge let me my father &amp; my mother kysse, &amp; than I'l follow thee. Go quoth he &amp; returne, for what belonged to me ys done to thee: &amp; he came backe &amp; to hym ministred. And since Benedad the kinge of syria wt h thirty two kinge ayded wt h all their Armyes ioyn'd to his. Samaria hath besieged and vnto Achab kinge of Israel, who ys wt h in the citty in great distresse a messenger hath sent, whom here I spy approchinge to the citty wall his messege to impart vnto the kinge, to wc h geue eare, &amp; so I will depart Messenger Kinge Achab. Achab. who ys that. Messeng[er]. Kinge Benedad my lord &amp; maister doth sende thee worde by mee that his ys both thy gold &amp; syluer wt h thy wyues &amp; thy children also that are vnto thee borne Kinge Achab. I &amp; my goods are his: So tell the Kinge at thy returne But I can not consent my wyues &amp; children to deliuer Messenger Your answeare I'l returne: But sure yt will displease my maister. Achab? Achab. who's there? Messeng[er]. my lord bade me say yt he would thy wyues &amp; children haue as well as thy syluer &amp; gold. To morrow therefore this same houre he'l sende his seruants to thee to serch your houses, &amp; what they lyke they away will cary. of this you may assured bee: And so Achab fare well Kinge Achab He seekes vs to intrap. what's your aduise Auncients of Israel? Auncients of Israel. No eare vnto hym geue: but yf agayne vnto you he do sende make answeare that we mynded are our selues for to defende Messenger. Achab thus sayth the kinge: This &amp; this doe the gods vnto mee yf that for ech one of his people your bullworkes handfulls bee Kinge Achab. Say to the kinge let not the girded glory as the vngirded for many haue had the foyle before the victory that bragged Messenger This foolish confidence of yours ere longe you will repent yet I'l go &amp; returne your answeare to the kinge incontinent who ready ys for to be-sett your citty on euery syde Kinge Achab. And for his intertaynment we'l be gone for to prouide Nuncius When that the syrians had besett Samaria round about the Israelits although they were both valiant men &amp; stout were frighted sore seinge so great a multitude &amp; company inclosinge them: But in this their distresse a prophet presently to Achab kynge of Israel came, &amp; to hym thus did say: I'l this huge multitude deliuer into thy hands this day that thou mayst know I am the lord. And the same was accomplished for Israel on the Syrians beinge drunken in their Tents, assaulted &amp; many of them slew, &amp; made the rest to runne away amongst whom was the kinge, &amp; so of them they got the day. But then the prophet came agayne, &amp; to the kinge fore tolde that come agayne agaynst the Israelits the Syrians would wt h a huge multitude, where as the Israelits are fewe yet Israel shall many of them kill, as them before they slewe &amp; make the rest to flee. And so yt fell out wt h the Syrians for sayinge the lord's god not of the valleis but the mountaynes And there's an hundred thousand foote men of ye syrians slayne wt h sword: And vpon seuen &amp; twenty thousand men that ranne away for feare in to the citty of Aphec, the wall fell. But Benadad the kinge escapt wt h some few who did counsell hym sayinge thus: Let's putt vpon our loynes sacke cloth, &amp; tye halters about our neckes, &amp; go to kinge Achab directly, for he perhaps will saue our lyues. And so yt came to passe that Benedads lyfe by Achab kinge of Israel spared was. And then in the word of our lord a certayne prophet sayde to his fellow stryke mee, but he would not do as he hym bade Where fore the prophet sayd to hym: Because thou would not stryke mee as our lord bade, behold a lion by the way shall deuour thee. And euen so yt did fall out. And then the prophet goinge a litle further mett an other vpon the high way trauellinge. To whom (quoth he) come &amp; stryke me: And yt same man hym wounded wc h done the prophet so his face wt h dust al to be-smered that he can not be knowne, &amp; to the kinge of Israel's gone And the cause why he hath hym selfe disfigured in this fashion yf you a whyle will patience haue you shall both heare &amp; see for here the prophet &amp; the kinge to gether cominge bee. Prophet Kinge Achab) hand strokes for to fight thy seruants did go out &amp; when a certayne man was flede one hym vnto me brought &amp; sayd see that thou keepe this man, for yf he slipp away thy lyfe shall be for his, or else thou shalt a talent pay of syluer: And whiles I beinge troubled turn'd me hither &amp; thither he sodaynly appeared not, but went I know not whither Kinge Achab. This shall the iudgment be, the wc h thou thy selfe hast decreed. A prophet I see thou art the dust beinge now from thy face wyped Prophet Kinge Achab thus much from our lord I lett the vnderstande because that thou hast letten go a man out of thy hande that worthy ys of death, assure thy selfe thy lyfe shall bee for his lyfe, &amp; thy people for his people. Achab. I scorne to heare thee wherefore I will returne into the citty wt h out delay. Prophet I nothinge sayd but truth. But syth he's gone I will away. Kinge Achab. Nabath geue me thy vinyard that's adioyninge to my palace for to make me a gardin of: &amp; in some other place I for yt will bestow on thee a vinyarde that ys better or yf thou thinke yt more commodious the worth of yt in syluer. Naboth Our lord be mercifull to me, that I geue not to thee th'Inheritance wc h my father at his death did leaue vnto mee Kinge Achab As good thou had yf that I lyue. But now I will be gone Naboth It's hard when that I must eyther in-curre his indignation or else my vinyard loose th'Inheritance lefte me by my father But I'l go, &amp; gods will be done in this thinge &amp; all other Nuncius Now is Kinge Achab in his palace, layd downe vpon his bed in such a melancholy fitt that he will eate no breade: wc h when Iesabel hys wyfe &amp; quene perceiu'd, she to hym went &amp; so soone as she vnderstoode what made hym discontent shee to hym sayd (my lord) you are a man of greate authority wherefore aryse &amp; eate, &amp; Naboths vinyard I will geue thee. And forth wt h shee did letters write in Achabs name, &amp; signed them wt h his ringe, &amp; sent them to the Auncients that inhabited the citty: And the tenor of them was. A fast proclame, &amp; make Naboth to sitt amongst the chiefe men at the same Then let two men who children are of Belial be suborned false witnes for to beare that he hath god &amp; the kinge cursed And then conuey hym out, &amp; to death lett hym stoned bee And the tenor of the letter was executed presently &amp; Naboth ston'd to death, where of so soone as Iezabel heard shee vnto Achab sayd: Arise &amp; possesse Naboths vinyard for he ys dead. And that same newes was to the kinge most pleasinge &amp; there of Now to take possession he here at hand ys cominge &amp; after hym Elias hyes, But what he'l to hym say attentyue be &amp; you shall heare, &amp; so I will away. [Elias] Kinge Achab thou hast slayne, yea &amp; more ouer hast possessed wherefore thus sayth our lord: In the place where the Dogs haue lycked the blood of Naboth, there by them thy blood shall licked bee Kinge Achab. What's that Elias that thou sayst? hast thou found me thyne enemy? Elias I haue found thee, for thou art sould in gods sight to do yll wherefore on thee &amp; thy posterity I'l euill bringe, &amp; kill of Achab hym that doth agaynst wall pisse, &amp; the inclosed &amp; last in Israel, &amp; because thou hast to wrath prouoked mee, &amp; made Israel synne, I will thy house make for to bee as Ieroboams &amp; Baasas houses were before thee And Iezabel in the fieldes of Iesrahel shall wt h Dogs be eaten Kinge Achab I sory am that I offended haue the god of heauen &amp; for griefe do my garments teare, &amp; shame make me hange downe my head. But for t'appease gods wrath I will go &amp; putt on heare cloth, &amp; fast: &amp; in sack cloth in the night tyme I'l lye God Hast thou not seene Elias how Achab's humbled before mee? &amp; syth he for my sake hym selfe hath humbled, I'l not rayse this euill in his house in his tyme, but in his sonnes dayes Elias I see (lord) thou art mercifull, &amp; takest great compassion on them that do repent: But in all things thy will be done. Kinge Achab. frende Iosaphat of Iuda kinge I glad am you to see. will yt not please you for to go to Ramoth Galaad wt h mee? (the wc h by right ys ours) agaynst the Syrian kinge to fight? Kinge Iosaphat. You &amp; I are all one, &amp; I'l help you to get your right But first I you beseech for to consult our lord whether wee shall thither go or not: for so to do me thinkes yt necessary Kinge Achab There to I geue consent, come wt h mee &amp; I will assemble the prophets wc h foure hundred are or there about in Israel. Kinge Iosaphat Now from the prophets mouthes you vnderstand that Ramoth Galaad shall be geuen vp in to the Kings hand yf that we thither go: for so wt h ioynt consent they sayd Kinge Iosaphat. Is there not here some prophet of our lord for to be had, that we may aske by hym? Achab. There's one man left but I hym hate for he doth prophecy no good to me, but yll, &amp; that Micheas ys Iemla his sonne. Iosaph[at]. Do not say so o kinge Kinge Achab. Melops wt h out delay go &amp; Micheas to me bringe. Sedecias a false prophet Achab thus sayth our lord wt h these yron hornes yu shalt shake Syria vntill thou yt destroy: And all the prophets wt h me say vp to Ramoth Galaad ascende, &amp; thus much vnderstand that our lord god will yt deliuer vp into the kings hand Melops K. Achabs seruant. Behold the prophets wt h one mouth preach good things to ye kinge Let thy worde therefore be lyke theirs, &amp; to hym good news bringe Micheas Our lord doth lyue that will I speake what s'euer our lord tells me Kinge Achab. Micheas shall we go to Ramoth Galaad for to fight or els sitt still. Micheas Go prosperously for our lord will deliuer yt vp into the kings hands Achab. I agayne &amp; agayne adiure thee in the name of our lord, that nothinge but the truth thou tell mee Micheas. I in the mountaynes saw all Israel lyke to sheepe dispersed haueinge no Sheepheard, &amp; our lord streight way to me appeared &amp; thus vnto me sayd: These haue no maisters but are maisterlesse wherefore let euery one returne in to his house in peace. Kinge Achab. Lo Iosaphat did not I say so much before hand to thee that he doth prophecy no good, but always yll vnto mee. Micheas. And more then this, I saw our lord sittinge vpon hys throne &amp; all the host of heauen hym assistinge both vpon his right hand &amp; his lefte: And our lord thus vnto them sayd: Who shall Achab deceiue that he may go to Ramoth Galaad &amp; in yt fall? And there came forth a spirit that stoode before our lord, &amp; sayd: I'l hym deceiue. Then our lord spake once more to hym, &amp; sayd: where in? I will (quoth he) go forth &amp; bee in the prophets mouthes a lyinge spirit. And our lord did reply: Thou shalt deceiue, &amp; shalt prevayle: Go thy way forth &amp; do so &amp; the lyinge spirit in to thy prophets mouthes did go. Sedecias a false prophet. Hath the spirite of our lord lefte mee, &amp; spoken vnto thee? Micheas. When in thy chamber thou shalt hyde thy selfe, that shall thou see. Kinge Achab. Come take Micheas hence away &amp; cary hym vnto Amon the gouernour of the citty, &amp; bid hym clapp hym vp in prison. &amp; wt h the bread of tribulation &amp; water of distresse let hym continually be fedd till I returne in peace Micheas. Yf thou returne in peace then hath our lord not spoken in mee heare all ye people. Achab. That shall we see. Kinge Iosaphat let's go to Ramoth Galaad for I am determined for to do so &amp; put you on your princely armour. But I will put on other Kinge Iosaphat Kinge Achab I contented am for to go wt h you thither Nuncius The kinge of Syria when he was a-bout to enter battell vnto his princes sayd: only wt h Achab see you medle. Yet not wt h standinge when the princes had Kinge Iosaphat seene they violently assaulted hym thinkinge that yt had bene the kinge of Israel because that be was in princely armour But streight the kinge of Iuda cal'd vpon our lord for succour &amp; held his colours up, where by the princes well perceiued that he was not the kinge of Israel, &amp; so from hym departed. Then one shooteinge an arrow, but aymeinge at no certayne marke by chaunce the kinge of Israel hitt betwixt his longs &amp; stomacke &amp; he vnto his cocher sayd. cary me out of the army for I am wounded vnto death, &amp; he hym thence did cary but by the way out of his chariot his blood ranne from his wound wc h (as the prophet had fore told the Dogs lyckt off the ground And the kinge in the eueninge dyed, &amp; t'Harauld a retreat sounded sayinge now lett all depart: And ech man to his home returned And Ochozias Achabs sonne ys now the kinge of Israell &amp; what of Iosaphat becomes shortly you shall heare tell for wt h hym here Iehu Hannani seers sonne now cometh &amp; his behauiour shewes that he the kinge for some thinge blameth Iehu. Kinge Iosaphat a wicked man &amp; impious thou hast ayded &amp; vnto them that hate our lord thou was in frendship ioyned &amp; our lords wrath thou for the same hast very well deserued. But yet good workes are found in thee, for wc h our lord thee spared because thou hast the groues out of the land of Iuda taken &amp; also hast prepard thy heart to serue the god of heauen Kinge Iosaphat. I synned haue (I do confesse) &amp; for the same am sory &amp; both I &amp; my people will here after be more wary for now I'l go &amp; geue a charge to ech man in his office their dutyes for to do accordinge to the rule of iustice. And Amarias priest &amp; Bishop in those thinges chiefe shall bee that appertayne to god. And Zabadias shall ouer see such things as vnto the kinge office are properly belonginge for in the house of Iuda he ys prince. So let's be goinge. Messenger Kinge Iosaphat my cominge ys to lett thee vnderstand that many &amp; mighty foes are cominge to invade thy land The Ammonits &amp; Moabits &amp; Syrians by name the wc h I haue fore told that thou may preuent the same Kinge Iosaphat Thankes my good frend for thy good will, &amp; take yt for thy labour But our best course (my lord) will be to flee to god for succour. because our forces are to smale agaynst so great a company vnlesse that we assisted bee &amp; helpt by god almighty. Wherefore I will go &amp; proclame a fast through out all Iuda &amp; to gods Temple in Hierusalem we'l go, &amp; pray. for god his seruants prayers will here that shall there be offered for so vnto kinge Salomon (who built yt) he hath promised Wherefore let's here no longer stay but forth wt h get vs gone Princes of Iuda. Renoned kinge we'l wayte on you beinge all of your opinion. Nuncius Kinge Iosaphat proclam'd a fast through all the land of Iuda &amp; euery one both man &amp; woman to gods house went to pray where they did cry vnto our lord in their great tribulation &amp; god their prayers heard out of his heauenly habitation &amp; by Iahaziel sent them worde that he would for them fight yf confidently they would go &amp; stand in th'enemyes sight wc h they perform'd, &amp; god did make their enemyes for to fall by th'eares to gether, till such tyme as they were dispatched all for th'Ammonits &amp; the Moabits did wt h them fight of mount Seir whom when they had destroy'd, they forth wt h murthered one an other. Then they of Iuda tooke the spoyle: But beare yt all away thence they could not in three days space for greatnes of the pray. And afterward they did returne wt h ioy in to Hierusalem playinge on their psalteries &amp; harps wt h Iosaphat before them, &amp; went in to the house of god, where they before had prayed &amp; for their victory to god most harty thankes they rendred And then the terrour of our lord vpon all Nations fell hearinge how god had fought agaynst the enemyes of Isral.

Nuncius In Ochozias kinge of Israels place Ioram his Brother (for he no sonne hath) reignes: And from Galgal I know not whither Elias now is gone wt h Eliseus in his company &amp; when they vnto Iordan came Elias putt off presently his mantell &amp; wrapt yt together, &amp; there wt h struck the water &amp; yt diuid'd yt selfe, &amp; they by dry land passed ouer. And then Elias vnt Eliseus sayd: aske of mee what thou wilt haue me do for thee ere I be taken from thee. I pray thee sayd Eliseus that thy duble spirit may be in mee. A hard thinge sayd Elias thou hast askt, yet yf thou see mee when I shall from thee be taken, thou shalt haue yt yu asked else not: And as they forward went, &amp; th'one wt h th'other talked a fyrie chariot, &amp; fyrie horses them two a-sunder parted &amp; by a whirlwynde into heauen Elias vp ascended. And Eliseus saw hym, &amp; did cry out father, father The chariot of Israel, &amp; he that's there of the guyder &amp; he saw hym no more. But vp the mantel of Elias he tooke, the wc h from hym at his departure fallen was. And vnto Iordan backe returnd, &amp; there wt h struck the water as he had seene Elias do: but he was no whit better for yt a-sunder did not part: wc h when Eliseus saw he forth wt h sayd: Where ys ye god now of Elias also? and smote the water, &amp; yt was this &amp; that way diuided So that Eliseus by dry land ouer the riuer passed. Wc h when the children of the Prophets saw yt were in Ierico they sayd Elias spirit vpon Eliseus resteth also And meeteinge hym they hym ador'd euen flatt vnto ye ground &amp; beinge all desyrous for to haue his maister founde wil'd that they might send fifty men wc h they there ready had to see whether that he by gods spirit were in ye mountayns layd, or valleis, but he sayd send not: yet they so sore hym vrged that in the ende he bade them send. And three days ye men searched but found hym not. And cominge to Eliseus back agayne did not I say (quoth he) send not, knowinge you sercht in vayne Then sayd the men of Ierico where Eliseus dwelled this citty standeth pleasantly, but ye ground where yt's seatted is barren &amp; the waters yll. fetch me Eliseus sayd a newe vessell wt h salt in. And they yt brought as he them bade And Eliseus to the fountayne of the waters went &amp; castinge salt there in sayd: thus sayth our lord god omnipotent. These waters I amended haue, &amp; in them death shall bee no more nor bitternes. And they were all amended presently. Then Eliseus vnto Bethel went, &amp; by the way litle boys out of the citty came, &amp; thus to hym did say &amp; that in floutinge wyse: come vp bald head, come vp bald head whom (when he had look't backe) in ye name of our lord he cursed And two Beares came out of ye forrest &amp; did in peeces teare fourty two boys. Then he went to Samaria &amp; dwelt there where he wt h water fild the ditches, &amp; that wt h outen rayne, when Ioram kinge of Israel for want of water did complayne. But Eliseus now is gone vnto a certayne widow who had the wyfe bene of a prophet, &amp; ys in griefe &amp; sorrow And shortly you shall know the cause, yf you will shew attention for here they cominge are together. And now I will be gone. Widow My husband who thy seruant was, ys dead, &amp; yu doest know he was a man that feared god, &amp; did obserue his low And the creditour ys come my two sonnes for to take away hym for to serue vnlesse I do the debt vnto hym pay Eliseus What's in thy house.

Nothinge sir but a litle oyle to anoynt mee Eliseus Go streight &amp; of thy neighbours borrow no few vessels yt are empty And when thou &amp; thy sonnes are in thy house shut fast the dore &amp; oyle out of thy litle vessell in to the other poure &amp; when they shall be filled full, let them be sett a syde &amp; come to me agayne, &amp; I the while will here abyde Widow Relyinge on your worde, wc h I doubt not shall be performed I will begone, &amp; all things do as you haue me enioyned The vessels all are filled full, &amp; the oyle runnes no more Eliseus Go then &amp; sell there of, &amp; wt h the money pay thy creditour. &amp; lyue thou &amp; thy sonne vpon the rest. So let's away Widow I geue you thanks, &amp; bound to you I will remayne for aye. Nuncius As Eliseus did by Sunam passe a deuout woman invited hym to eate wt h her, &amp; sayd to her good man I do perceiue this holy man of god doth often passe this way: A chamber let vs make for hym, that he a place may haue of rest: &amp; they so did, &amp; there in sett a bedd wt h a stoole &amp; a candlestick, where he goinge yt way rested. And on a day beinge there he thus did say vnto ye Sunamite thou shalt a sonne haue this tyme twelue month. May I (quoth she) thee credit? for my husband ys growne in yeares. do not deceiue thy handmayd Thou shalt (quoth he) &amp; yt did come to passe as he had sayd. But shortly after her sonne dyed, &amp; she hym forth wt h cast vpon Eliseus bed, &amp; went to seeke hym in great hast. And in mount carmel findinge hym, she on his feete layd hold Wc h when Giezi Eliseus seruant saw &amp; would haue her remou'd, his maister sayd: let her alone, for shee in anguish ys, &amp; our lord hath yt not reueal'd vnto mee. Then to hym sayd the woman Did I aske of my lord a sonne? did not I say deceiue me not? And yet this thinge ys done Then to Giezi he did say: let thy loynes girded bee, &amp; thy staffe in thy hand take, &amp; go, &amp; yf any man meete thee Salute hym not, nor answeare hym yf any man thee salute. And when thou comes vnto the child, thy staffe on his face putt. I will not sayd the mother of the child go backe wt h out thee Wherefore Eliseus wt h her went: But ere they came Giezi had layd his staffe on the childes face: But there in hym appeared neyther sense nor lyfe: where fore to meete his maister he returned &amp; tolde hym sayinge: The childe's not rysen. And then Eliseus went into the house, and shutt the dore, &amp; on the child incontinent he pray'd vnto our lord layinge his eyes on the childes eyes &amp; his mouth on his mouth, &amp; his handes on his handes lyke wyse, &amp; ouer hym he bow'd hym selfe, &amp; the childes flesh was warmed. And when Eliseus vp &amp; downe the house a while had walked the childe seuen tymes did gaspe, &amp; his eyes open: Then to the Sunamite Eliseus sayd: There take thy sonne: &amp; shee fell at his feete &amp; hym adored to the ground, &amp; wt h her sonne then went. And Eliseus vnto Galgal did returne incontinent: where famine was: And there the bitternes of coloquintida wc h by chaunce was putt in a pott of potage, he tooke away. And wt h a few loaues fedd a mighty multitude of people &amp; some was left, for yt to eate vp all they were not able. And the next wonder that he'l worke, is curinge of the leprosy of prince Naaman, as in tyme you shall most playnly see.</field>
