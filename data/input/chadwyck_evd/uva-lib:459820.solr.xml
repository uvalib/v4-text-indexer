      <field name="fulltext">THE Two QUEENS OF BRENTFORD: OR, Bayes no Poetaster: A Musical Farce, or Comical Opera.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poets, in tricking Times, Satyrick grown, Seldom excusing Faults their Plays have shewn, Oft with sharp Prologues lash the foolish Town. So Bayes, his Lyrick Opera brings to view, And what some Actors in blunt Satyr do, The Prologue and the Epilogue will shew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERSES Epistolary, Humbly Dedicated with this Book, to the most Noble, his Grace, PHILIP, Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Wharton, Marquis of Winchendon, and Lord of Harleigh, Lord High Steward of Malmsborough, Marquis of Caterlough, Earl of Caterhaven, Baron of Trim, and one of the Lords of the Privy Council of Ireland. Descend, great Peer, t'accept my Muses Strains, And nobly grace my Lyrical Remains; Let my Dramatick Whimsies entertain, My Comick Tales too, please your sprightly Vein; And then my Verse shall make me brisk and young As Maro's once, who to Augustus sung. In Verse, I then your artful Genius treat; Verse, that I know, you can so well repeat, With Skill superior, and with Cadence sweet; That could from Pegasus a Pen be gain'd, And from that soaring Plume your Praise extend, I should your Fame in glorious Heights expose, The Subject being much too great for Prose. Sing then, Apollo, touch thy rapting Lyre, And with thy Rays my mounting Thoughts inspire, That Wharton's Worth may soar beyond the Sun, Then be my Theme seraphick His fine Country Seat. Winchendon; Where if my happy Leaves are once turn'd o'er To please my Patron with their Comick Store: The Rural Gods that in that Garden rove, Where beauteous Flora and her Sylvæ move; The Walks, the Trees and Flowers can ne'er enjoy With half the Deified Content as I. Oh! great Vertumnus, God of Woods and Bowers, Where Hero's and sweet Beauty wast their Hours, And Wine do's often relish blest Amours; That bringst the Hortans to their Gard'ning Skill, Who Winchendon's rare Banks with Odours fill, Sound Wharton's Name, who do's thy Palace raise, A Dome for Gods alone to sound his Praise! Fam'd A fine Banquetting House in his Garden. (Brimmer-Hall) for Beauty, Musick, Wit, New form'd, and only for thy Godhead fit; Command but the rare Tube which once I found, Cælestial Spheres ne'er gave so sweet a Sound. 'Tis thus, my Lord, you revel in the Grace Of Art and Nature, in that glorious Place; Nature, the Mast'ry of your Garden Shews, And Art, your Books of Poetry expose; When Latian Virgil gilds your Latin Stile, And Britain's Shakespear, who adorns our Isle. So thoughtful Atticus Rome's Court rever'd, But Politicks incumbent seldom heard; His Tongue ne'er us'd a flattering fond Debate, His curious Garden was his Room of State; And whilst dear Nature did gay Scenes express, All Beaus and Belles were slighted like his Dress. So you, great Sir, neglect that gaudy Train, Your Wit is sparkling, but your Garb is plain. And as in Roman Dramma's of past Age, When Roscius and Esopus trod the Stage; Pomponius well could weigh each poinant Thought, And they were by his judging Action taught: Or as when Plautus, or smart Terence wrote, That artful Bard would pierce each Distich thro', And tell if Cadence, or the Wit was true; But yet with Order, and such Calmness mov'd, No Author e'er could feel he was reprov'd: So you, my Lord, with Judgment right assign'd, In our best Actors Grace and Error find; Can tell where Shakespear do's like Jove appear, And where he tumbles from his lofty Sphere. In Poems too, what droop, and what excel, And the Distinction with such Candor tell, That Virgil would not be asham'd to soar, Nor would Bathillus mean his Verse give o'er. To reach such Merit, God-like Verse should shine, But pardon Failings in that vast Design, And take (with Nobleness of Temper) mine.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. The outside of the Playhouse. Enter Smith, Johnson and Chanter. Smith. Is he there, think ye? Chant. I tell ye he is. As we were drinking our Coffee, I saw him go by, and turn down Vinegar-Yard, to get by the Narrow Passage; I have sent one to him, you shall see him bolt immediately. John. Prithee Jack Smith excuse me, I shall ne'er have Patience, I shall rail again. Smith. Nay, nay, a pox on thee, hast not thou promis'd to make me amends by Patience this Morning? for as Will Chanter has made it out, by thy hurrying me away, we lost the best part of our Diversion yesterday. John. A Plague on him, he has given me the Spleen so, with the confounded Dialogue between the Eclipses, the Sun, the Moon, and his Terra firma, with the terrible noise of the Hobbyhorse Battel, that I shall only increase it; for I expect no other Diversion, but such Fooleries, therefore prithee excuse me. Smith. Faith, Sir, I shall not, you have solemnly ingaged to keep me Company this Morning; and I as solemnly expect it: Besides, Chanter tells me, that the last part of the Rehearsal is more divertive than all the rest. Chant. Oh, 'tis most certain the musical part of it is most entertaining; 'tis a kind of Comical Opera; and the diversity of Humours, as well as other solemn Parts you'll find, will be very pleasant. Smith. D'ye hear, Supercillium, d'ye hear? egad we shall be so merry—I warrant thou'lt laugh till thy Stomach akes. John. I fear I shall rather be apt to ease my Stomach another way. Chant. No, no, there's something in't will please, I warrant ye, if you can have Patience; I have got one of the Songs in't ready set; I think I have it about me,—you shall hear it, [Searches for it. od'slife I'm prevented—here he comes. Enter Bayes. Bayes. Any body here would speak with me? Chant. Your Servant, Mr. Bayes; yes, Sir, 'twas I that sent in t'ye. Bayes. For what, Pray Sir? Chant. Why, Sir, Mr. Smith, here and his Country Friend, desir'd me to introduce 'em once more, to beg your Pardon. Smith. Which we do with all our Hearts, faith, Mr. Bayes; look sneakingly and be hang'd. [Aside to Johnson. D'sdeath that damn'd squeamish Phiz will spoil all again. Bayes. Oh—your humble—Gentlemen, your Servant Mr. a—Pardon; what they are come to spoil another Rehearsal, are they? Yesterday's last Act, and the Musick were quite lost; I endeavour'd by running, to call ye back to retrieve your Senses that were gone Post before ye; ha! ha! ha—but 'twas in vain, ha! ha! ha! ha! Chant. Ah—Sir! they are now extreamly sensible of it. Bayes. Look'e, Sir, I shall require at least a Week's time to believe that; in the mean time, to my Knowledge, they have lost the Town considerable Diversion, for this Day; for the Play was to have been acted, and the Places all taken—Pray, Sir, what amends can your Country Worship [To Johnson. make 'em for that? Smith. Ah—No, no, Sir, 'tis impossible; A plague of all Business; why you must know, Sir, that he's involv'd in an impertinent Suit of Law, and was yesterday (which he had forgot) to have a Tryal at Bar, for the Recovery of 4000 l. Was not it, Johnson, tell Mr. Bayes? Pox on ye, speak something. [Aside. John. What a Devil should I speak?—Tell your Lies your self, since y'are so good at it—You have begun rarely. [Aside. Smith. Chanter, help out— Chant. His feeing the Law Tongue-pads has so doz'd him, that on my Conscience he has forgot his own Cause, which might have been carry'd, no doubt, as well without him—but he would now fain recover the Reputation of being counted a Wit, by a fresh Judgment of your Piece, here, Sir. Smith. He has been begging us all this Morning to bring him, tho' he's asham'd to speak himself; has not he, Chanter? Chant. Yes, Sir, he has been teizing us horribly—to be admitted. John. So, these Rakes have given admirable Proofs, that lying will choak no body—that I'll say for 'em. [Aside. Bayes. Counted a Wit, did you say, Mr. a ha, ha, ha; No, no, let him despond, let him despair of that Ifaith; for he that to follow the Trifle of four thousand Pounds, could leave such an invaluable Enjoyment as this was, take it from me, on the Word of a Poet, will never arrive at that Title: But odso, I stand prating here, and the Players stay for me to begin: Your Servant, Gentlemen, I shall want no Judgments, no Criticks this Morning. Smith. Nay, prithee Bayes, I know thou art good natur'd. Chant. Mr. Smith admires the Account I gave him of the Musick that is to be: And then the Comical Songs come presently, 'tis a Musical Lecture to our Countrymen, we'll have one of 'em that thou gav'st me, I'm sure that will put thee in Humour. [Song here. Bayes. Well, as the worthy and famous Sir Bernard Gascoin said, who on his Death-bed desir'd one to sing; If a Man were dying he would be pleas'd with this—Well, let's go then. Come, Critical Sir, for your Friend's Sake, once more I'll venture a Lash from your Country Satyr— tholl, loll, loll, loll, loll. [Sings. [Exeunt Smith and Johnson, Bayes and Chanter stay behind a little. Chant. So, so, I told ye I would bring 'em. Bayes. 'Tis well: And now prithee, Friend, humour the Matter as we have agreed on, and as I for my Part will comically give occasion; which ended, the Jest shall be on our side, I warrant thee. Chant. Never doubt me: I'm instructed. [Exeunt. Scene II. The inside of the Playhouse. Enter Belrope and Tokay. Their Parts in their Hands. Bel. A News-monger is a modern Character, that we are sure of; and since 'tis so, I like it well enough for Variety. Tok. My French-man too, may prove a Jest, if 'tis rightly taken; but whether 'tis or no, I'm gone so far, I must do it now: Oh! here the Author comes. Enter Bayes, Smith, Johnson and Chanter. Bayes. So, Gentlemen, good morrow t'ye—Hey! Scene-keeper, some Chairs here. [Chairs brought in.] Come, Mr. a—but Consideration. D'ye hear—This Morning's Work will admit of no trifling Questions. [To Johnson. Smith. Ay, ay, he'll consider, Mr. Bayes. John. Faith, I find my Consideration at this time will be very much inclin'd to repose it self, I slept ill last Night: [They sit.] And a Morning's Nap may be very convenient. Chant. Nay, prithee. John. I have done, Sir— Bayes. Come, my Friends, then since you have promis'd so fairly, you shall once more be diverted: And first, you shall hear a Comical and Satyrical Prologue—not that of the Thunder and Lightning that I rehearsed and manag'd before, but another, which is yet in Suspense, and forbid to be spoke—A devilish shy Thing, so tickling, and yet so sharp, ha! ha! ha! but I have one Court Friend, faithful as a Cherubim, that has promis'd me to get an Order of Council to have it spoke; he says, the Town sha'n't lose so much Wit, let the Stockjobbers manage the Senate as they please. Smith. Is't against them? that must please without doubt. John. Ay, and some of the Senate will be even with this Fool, that's without doubt, too. [Aside. Chant. Has it any Name, Mr. Bayes? let's hear, prithee. Prologue's INTRODUCTION Bayes. No, Sir, we never give these Prologue Rarities Name—And yet I have one that would fit it rarely, rarely faith; why look'e, I could call it, The Sham-Mississippi: Or, The Exchange-Alley-Sharpers, ha, ha, ha; but 'tis stinging at first, but igad they grow so powerful, that I dare not venture. Smith. Why? if it be smart, the City way, you must make a Party. Bayes. Egad, so I should; a good Body of undone Tradesmen, if they would stickle hard, would do my Business; but I consider'd after I begun, and so turn'd it into Complement. Chant. Well, prithee Friend let's hear it, there must be good Humour in't. Bayes. Humour! ay, and pleasant Humour too; cutting as a Razor, for all its Insinuations, Gentlemen; and shaves all the Nation together: The Lords shake Hands with the Brokers, and are brotherly familiar; the Ladies smile when Stock goes well; and when they are disappointed—Ye shall hear, ye shall hear, Gentlemen; if this do's not get me Stock, and a Million or two, when the Lines are consider'd, there is no Consideration in the City, egad. Smith. Oh—no doubt on't, no doubt on't, come begin. PROLOGUE. Bayes reads in a Paper. From Callidonian Sense, and artful Pains, In which th'Oxonian Statesman shew'd his Brains, I, that for Murder fled, have had the Chance By Mississippi, to redeem all France. John. How, Sir! how, Sir! Callidonian Sense, Murder and Mississippi: Ounz! had it not been much better to have brought in a Scotch Pedlar, who knock'd his Hostess on the Head, for demanding her Reckoning of nine Pence three Farthings? Would not that have been jocose? Chant. Nay, now the Devil's in thee, Johnson, to interrupt him; he begins very well, faith; pray go on, Sir. Bayes. Nay, nay, Sir, if you won't be quiet, the Satyr shall sleep; 'twill grow resty, 'twill bear no purrings— I tell ye that, Sir. Smith. Oh, prithee don't mind him. Bayes reads again. In spite of want, their Janglings and their Frets, 'Tis we have crown'd their K?g and paid his Debts. Of Bullion, tho' no Plenty did excel, We've conjur'd Paper, that has don't as well. John. We! We! What we, Mr. Bayes? Who are the We? Bayes. Egad, I won't tell ye—cudgel your Brains for't, and if you can't find it out, then—presto I say. Chant. Oh, he's a Madman. Bayes reads again. And now from fulsom Rake, by trading Plots, My nasty Maggots, all turn'd serious Thoughts, I, and great Partner, have in England sped, The grand South Sea we've politickly bred, Enrich'd the Peerage, and confounded Trade. Hum—Mr. Smith, what think ye? Smith. Strong, strong, Mr. Bayes, very home that. Bayes. It must be so, Sir, it can't be help'd, egad I write for a Place, I tell ye; I have that in my Head—But to go on— Reads again. Yet thousands still are got, the Gainer's glad; The Commons are amaz'd, the Lords are mad; A glorious Peer, of wondrous Wealth I know, A Million Plumb, all got, the Lord knows how, Yet him the South Sea has so cram'd with Heaps, A Days he never dines, a Nights he never sleeps. Sly Brokers at all Hours his Sense controul: Change-Alley shares his Body and his Soul. Smith. Good again— Bayes reads again. The Ladies too in Coach to Brokers run, The Fair, the Brown, the freckl'd, and the Dun; Fat Widows smile when dear Stock rises high; But if the Vote comes that it falls,—they cry This is the South Sea Fate, no Bilk, no Par; It cannot prove a Trick, 'tis gone so far. John. Ha! ha! ha! enough, enough—prithee, no more on't—a Trick, why is not all the World there? All Degrees of People, and all their Stock? How can it be a Trick? Bayes. Ay, but the Satyr, the Satyr, Mr. Smith, ha! ha! ha! Oonz—he does not understand. Smith. No, no—but proceed, proceed, prithee, we'll have it all, faith— Reads again. Yet 'tis a Farce, and by Stock-jobbers plaid, Shopkeepers mourn, no Debts are to be paid; Garters and Lords of Rank won't pay their Dues; They can't be trusted for a Pair of Shoes; If Dun crys out—my Lord, I shall be broke; No help, crys he, my Money's all i'th' Stock; I've scarce enough at this next Bubble-meeting To pay my Friends, the Brokers, for their Sweating; Oonz—what a Game is here? Cit crys, with Oaths, No Money for your Meat, nor for your Cloaths: Why then, tho' Bubbles spread, and Fish excels, The Ace of Hearts doll'd off at Tunbridge Wells: The Royal-Oak, Hazard and Lotteries past Were ne'er such Bites as this will be at last. There, Yar?d comes proud and morosely grave, Who a superiour Wit believes to have; Prates all the Day, then topes till he gets drunk, And from Change-Alley meets Rose-Alley Punk. Then Aub? G? to, with Assurances Can bubble every Cully as they please, Tho' now the Proclamation gives us Ease. 'Twas such propos'd to th'Commons, and the Lords, Shavings and Sawdust cast to make deal Boards. Smith. Well said, Mr. Bayes, that was a Rub, egad. Bayes. Ay, Sir, I think so. Chant. Proceed, dear Poet, go on. Reads again. Yet tho' these Bubbles some nice Shams produce, The Tracts are carried best amongst the Jews, Who work by underhand, and send their Boys, Not twelve Years old, who spreading plaguy Lies, Fill up the Road to Garraway's—and stare With Cole-black Eyes, no Emblem of the Fair; And busie to buy Stock, that common Evil, With Garlick-breath the Fragrance of the Devil, Converse with Fishing-Bubbles, and appear As if they all had seen the fiftieth Year. But now 'mongst Bubbles rare, let me not pass The Quaker quaint, that bustling Babe of Grace, That buys and sells, and spreads each odious thing With such a Sound, he makes Change-Alley ring. The Clumsie Broad-hat, that from Norwich was Politely sent to state the Weaver's Case, And prove flower'd Callicoes, that fill our Shoars, And worn by Dames of Rep' as well as Whores, Were us'd so much, it turn'd 'em out of Doors. Nor that East-India Plain-man that durst try The t'other Spittle Notions to deny, 'Mongst th'Commons, did not half that Clangor raise, As he at Jonathan's and Garraway's. No Fish-wife ever could so loudly bawl, Our Quaker's horrid Din surpass'd 'em all. Chant. Ha! ha! ha! faith, Mr. Bayes, that's very humorous too. Bayes. Ay, Sir, but now a little touch upon the Bank. Reads again. The Bank, that does with sep'rate Interest grow Imagines our South Sea—their wily Foe Laughs at the thriving Game they're playing there, And wisely does not their Conclusion fear. No Bubbles, Plots, do from their Pains arise, The Piece they act is solid Merchandize; And smile with the Dutch Fishery, who all join To buy the Bubbles off, with their own Coin. But if to th'African you turn your Eyes, You'll view their Motions, justly known to rise, There's something stanch, Gold-dust will please your Sight, With Teeth of Elephants, large, sound and white. The South Sea has no Mint for raising Sums, 'Tis a rare Whim they shew, but Bullion comes. John. Very well, Mr. Poet, and what Place when the South Sea has prefer'd ye, do you aim at Court by this, pray? Bayes. Why, Sir, if you must know, I think to be Poet Laureat. John. What—and my Lord Chamberlain not your Friend, and ignorant of your Poetry?—Ha! ha! ha! ha! Smith. Phoo, pox, prithee don't mind, but read on. Reads again. Strange Frolicks may at last Confusion bring, But the York-buildings is a serious Thing, Firm, stanch, and must not be a Bubble call'd, But by the Wise be honour'd and extoll'd: The Substance of its Worth shall raise its Fame, When South Sea with Assurances meet Shame, Tho' now we find it gets the greater Name. No Project manag'd, e'er had such Report, Those out—altho' they rail—are sorry for't: When Bubbles fell, they gen'rally were glad, But yet, Stock-getting thousands, makes 'em mad: The Senate is not wise enough to slight; No Member rails, when he gets something by't. But for the W?s, they now run down the Wind, The T?s start the Hare, and all are join'd; Directors, when a Stock does new begin, Who govern all, won't let a W?g come in. The Bullion gain'd is always too apply'd T'indulge the Parties of their own dear Side: So they'll have all the Money in the Land, Whilst L?w-C?h snarls, at what the H?h-C?h gain'd. Smith. Good, good, rarely good, Mr. Bayes, by my Soul! Reads again. Affairs to, you shall see will turn their Way; Money must rule, the Devil will have his Day. And when a Million's by the South Sea got, You'll find 'tis the Directors T?y Plot. And now soar on, my Muse, and Prologue Vein, Let my Conclusion prove a lofty Strain. A Million's nam'd, but I have found out one, A South Sea Patron, that so far has gone, Five Millions to his bulk of Gain does tend, Which must be clear, at the fam'd Dividend; If great Change-Alley can shew more such Men, The Governour must his Commission end. Rich England will have forty Millions Store, A Sum, egad, I ne'er knew in't before, And all this got the Mississippi way, For nothing now gets something every Day; And solid Sums give the whole Town Content, As being confirm'd by Act of Parliament. Smith. Gad a merry Friend, 'faith, thou hast ended nobly. Chant. Bold, and to the Purpose, and, as thou say'st, with a Whim too. John. Oh the Devil, if all this Stuff be a Prologue, what will the Play be? Oh— Bayes. Stuff! prithee pray for a help to thy Understanding: now, Friend Smith, how the Town will be amaz'd, when they consult whether this Prologue be a Satyr or a Complement, ha! ha! ha! there will be the Jest of all, ha! ha! ha! ha! And now pray see if the Kings are dress'd [To the Actors who go out] and begin. This Act, you must know, Gentlemen, opens with some other new Characters, which by the way, let me tell ye, is one of the chiefest Embelishments a good Play can have; for as nothing is more divertive than Variety; so to bring in often fine new Characters— Mr. Smith—hum— Smith. Must infallibly, infallibly please, Mr. Bayes. Chant. Oh, most certainly. John. Yes, yes, a good Character will doubtless please; but— Bayes. But, pray, Sir, no Buts, no Boundings, I beseech ye; if these are not divertive Characters, why look'e then I have no Skill in Dramaticks, which the insensible part of Mankind will hardly allow, I suppose—Come, Mr. Smith, you are a Man of Candor, you shall judge; for your part, you will do well to hear Reason, Sir— [To Johnson. John. Yes, Sir— Chant. Ha! ha! ha! Bayes. Why then, Mr. Smith, to let ye fairly into the Secret of these new Characters; if you remember Yesterday in the fourth Act, just before the pleasant Omen of the Eclipses, and the horrible bloody Battel, which egad were two excellent Decorations, as ever adorn'd a Tragedy, there was a notable blustring Scene between Prince Volcius and Prince Prettiman. Smith. Ay, ay, Mr. Bayes, I remember the Scene very well. Chant. And I, the Rant was about a Mistress. Bayes. A Mistress, ah! y'are both weak sighted Inspectors, 'faith—No, no, 'twas evident there was a deeper Design than a Mistress a foot. John. Ay, and which considering these are two Conjurers, they might easily enough have found out. Bayes. For 'twas as plain as the Sun, that those ambitious Princes had plotted the deposing the Usurpers, King Usher, and King Phiz, to set up themselves; and were then mystically arguing in Heat, though they talk'd of Mistresses of their Methods in Stratagem. Smith. Say ye so, I confess that was beyond my Reach, indeed. Bayes. Ay, like enough—'tis not every one has this Head. John. No, no, one that has so little in't, 'tis suppos'd. [Aside. Bayes. Now this Conspiracy, like the rest of the World, has not proved very lucky you must know, for it was soon after discovered to the two Kings—but by who, think ye? ha! ha! ha! why by their subtle and sharp-witted Queens— which said Queens—a—a— Smith. Hold, hold, pray, Mr. Bayes—the Queens— I don't remember through the whole course of your Play, that the two Kings were ever married. Bayes. Why, no Sir, it may be so, there's a Surprize for ye then, to chew upon first, for perhaps I did not design you should know—But married they are; and have Children too, a Son, and a Daughter. John. Ay, ay, and one of the Queens big again. Bayes. Nay, pray, Sir; the Son a very hopeful young Prince, the Daughter marvelously fair too, but somewhat unfortunate in her Shape. John. What hump, crooked, or so? Bayes. Ay, Sir—her Mother long'd to be grubling in a Molehill, and she was born with one upon her Back— Smith. This is surprising truly, did you expect any Queens, Chanter? Chant. Not I, faith, I took the Kings for a couple of good honest toping Fellows, that I rather thought inclin'd to keep two Mistresses. Bayes. Oh! did you so, Sir; but you must know that Virtue in Poetry is my constant Standard; I build and uphold Legitimate Royalty, I am ever against all spurious Pretenders. John. A devilish Polititian, this Poet, 'twas such as he I believe that Plato banish'd the Commonwealth. Bayes. Besides, I call my Play here by their very Titles, The two Queens of Brentford; that's enough, I think, to introduce 'em—And now, Sir, to explain the Catastrophe, and to come to my Characters, the Ushers and the Phizgigs, two strong Parties, though no body knows yet who they will declare for, (whether the right Kings, the Usurpers, or the Princes) grow popular, and want a Mouth to vent themselves by, or else to write for 'em, which Mouth, or a knavish Scribe, is this first new Character, and he that can say 'tis a bad one— Chant. Oh—a bad one, the Devil's in any one that can. John. Oh—confounded—tholl, loll, loll. [Sings a Piece of a Tune. Bayes. In short my Design, ha! ha! ha! ha! is Satyr upon the News-mongers; besides, there's like to be a good Plot into the Bargain. Smith. Ay, Sir, that's as plain as the Sun, as you say. Chant. And that's a very material Thing. Bayes. Right, Mr. Chanter, 'tis so—Oh! here they are come; pray begin the Scene; [Enter Firebrand Belrope, and Monsieur Tokay, with Papers in their Hands.] Look'e, you may chance to find, Gentlemen, especially if I give a little hint, that this Firebrand Belrope, has something Enigmatical in his very Name. Come—I won't pump for a Question, for I'm sure you have it by your smiling. John. The Devil take me if ever I looked graver in my Life. Bayes. As to his Character, he formerly was a Bookworm, but is now a Merchant in Politicks, beneficially spreading 'em weekly abroad in Penny Papers; a damn'd shrewd Fellow you'll find him—and privately in the Interest of the two Princes. Smith. Very well, Sir. John. Oh— [Groans. Bayes. The t'other there with black Whiskers, is a Foreign Spy, Secretary here to a Nobleman, and feeds Belrope there with Foreign Intelligence, to furnish the coxcombly part of the Town with News; a devilish Fellow in his Way too, and pumps the Wager-layers and Stockjobbers in the City confoundedly; ha! ha! ha!—but now let 'em shew themselves—come, speak. Bel. Why there's nothing in this at all, Monsieur, we shall be duller than the worst of Libels, the Flying Post—Sure Politicks from the Baltick dwindle mightily. Bayes. D'ye hear—observe that, the Baltick. Tok. Look you, Sire, de grand Politique lika de Sea— have de Ebb, and de Flow—Dere is no Mischeife dat have stirr from mon Maitre de Embassador here, nor our Party all de last Week; Patiance, Monsieur, we must have de Patiance. Bayes. We must have de Patiance—very well, Mr. a— He mimicks the French Jargon well enough—Go on, Sir— Bel. Pize on't, this dull Story foisted in here, won't do neither; odsnigs I must take my old way, and mawl 'em by an impudent Lye or two; I must not let our Party cease wond'ring, for want of something to amuse 'em; therefore if ye are drawn dry, we must invent: I have told 'em lately of a design'd Invasion, but a pox on 'em, the Phizgiggs laugh at that; but however, I must set out more News, true or false, 'tis all one by Jingoe. Bayes. By Jingoe—ah—that's pretty well; but Mr. a —give me leave to put in a Word; you speak mighty well, Sir, and are a very pretty Fellow, but methinks you don't look your part enough. Bel. No, Sir—. Bayes. No, Sir; methinks you seem to fail in your Grimace; keep that up, pray, Sir, look it right whatever you do; that is, to be plain, look as much like a Rogue as ever you can—Ah! Sir, if you don't look your part, you spoil it, what say you, Gentlemen? Smith: Faith I think as he orders it, his Face becomes his Character extreamly. Chant. Oh! very well, extreamly well; do's it not, Johnson? John. A pox! prithee don't ask me. Bayes. Do's it? why then I beg your Pardon, Sir, and pray go on Monsieur; but hark you, mon Amis. Tok. But hark you, mon Amis, you know de two Prince have entertain us on dere Side, you know likewise, Broder— Bel. Well, well, I know likewise, the two Kings having Notice of their Treason, have sent for 'em, to be examin'd; but I'll have a Paper out to morrow, to ridicule 'em for't damnably. The Town shall have its Regalia: The Coffee-house Gapers, I'm resolv'd, shan't want their Diversion. Bayes. Ha, ha, ha, d'ye hear him, Sir, d'ye hear him? Is not that a Character now of a rare Rogue? Smith. A very fine Fellow, truly. Chant. Now, Johnson. John. Oh Superfine! oh Quintissence!—Pox on ye. [Aside. Tokay. De Treason den being discover, de Prince must be vor certain pute in de Prison. Bayes. Now, now mind, here's a Choakpear for ye. Bel. Without doubt, their Female Majesties, by notable Subtlety, having discovered their Plot to their Husbands— but— Bayes. But—here's a Secret coming, shall cause a Disappointment for all that.—Oonz, where's Mr. Discipline? —Now—oh! quick, quick, pray, Mr. a— [Enter Discipline, with a Pen and Paper.] You quite ruin the Scene, if you don't enter Souse upon the Matter— Quick, quick—pray speak. Discip. So, Brother Incendiary, is this your Place for Politicks, where the two Kings are within three Yards of ye, sitting in Judgment? 'Dslife, I could hear ye plain into the Lobby, where I was Writing—Out upon ye, is this the Discretion of Deputy Statesmen?—Ha, ha, ha; well, egad I shall have some fresh Matter for my Paper to morrow however by it: ha, ha, ha,—You Polititians! ha, ha, ha, [Points and laughs at 'em. Exit. Smith. Humph—Very odd and whimsical; prithee, what snip snap Fellow is this? Bayes. Why this you must know is a notable Observator on the King's Party against Belrope—A word in your Ear softly, he's really a Popish Priest, tho' he goes here for a true Royalist. Chant. Oh! the fitter for Politicks, that's certain; but hark'e; prithee, Friend, what's this Secret, that must hinder the Prince's Conviction? Smith. Ay that, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Why that, Sir, I brought this Fellow in, because you and the Audience should not know—There's decorum now, there's Management for ye; that Discovery is not ripe yet; every thing must have its Time, Mr. Smith: Go, go, sneak off, Conspirators. [Exeunt Belrope and Tokay.] And now for the first Musick, a little Masque to amuse the Audience, whose Minds must be harass'd with this Scene of Politicks—The Design is some Humours in a Camp—Come flourish, Violins; and then enter a General Officer, who is suppos'd to be deeply in Love— Oh! your Servant, Mr.—Come, Sir, pray let's hear your Noble Voice. Here the Mask begins. SONG I. When Semele with Luster shone All her Virgin Glories on, Brighter than the God of Day, When the sparkling Atoms play: Or when Danae, rapt with Gain, Smil'd to see the Golden Rain; Or as Læda to be proving Her fair Swans Luxuriant Loving, Scatter'd Beauty's Darts around him, Healing still as they did wound him: So fresh Beauty still I chang'd, So, like Jove, I lov'd and rang'd. But since my Cælia blest our Albion's Shore, All, all these joyful Freedoms are no more. Cælia's exalted Wit and Beauty joyn'd, Cælia's triumphant Greatness of the Mind: Cælia in her lovely State, Rare as Nature could create, Charms me from what I should be To the Slave of Constancy. Second Movement. But I'll break the rough Chain, And turn Rover again; 'Tis a Shame for a Man, With a Sword in his Hand; That has Hundreds in Store, To take less than a Score. I'll plunder the Race; to be constant to one, Must make me a Coward, and then I'm undone. Bayes Sings after him.] Must make me a Coward, &amp;c. —Your humble Servant, dear Mr. Leveridge—And so pray go off, Sir. [Exit. Singer. And now enter Robin the Sutler. Smith. Well, what think ye now, Johnson? John. A plague, this is none of his, I'll be damn'd if he wrote a Line on't—No, no, this must be stole. Chant. Ha, ha, if you should be mistaken now— Well, let's hear the rest, what's this Robin he's calling for? Bayes. Why Robin, Robin, Good-fellow Robin, the Devil, a-pox, where are ye?—Come, come, Sir, the Stage stays for ye—Now, Gentlemen, to vary the Humour, [Enter a Singer.] and consequently improve Variety; as the last was lofty, this here is a little light, low Fancy, which Method of Diversion I resolve to take; high and low, high and low, low and high, perpetually, like a— John. Like a Sowgelder's Horn; there I've helpt ye to a good Simile, egad, Smith. Ha, ha, ha,—Oh, a confounded Simile, don't mind him, prithee let the Musick go on. Bayes. Sir, I don't mind ye, that's in short—And therefore, Gentlemen, as I said, this is to be a low Humour— he's Sutler, you must know, to the Camp; besides, lately made a Serjeant; and his merry Song is to give ye a Comical Account of himself, and some of his Family; come begin, Robin— Enter Serjeant. SONG. Serj. Sings. I. Three Daughters I had by my Spouse, A black, a brown, a yellow, That for a Season plagu'd my House As they by Years grew mellow, The first would scold, the second Pout, The third would fling and flounce about, And make all Day a hideous Rout: Whilst each did want a Fellow. Bayes. Good, pray mind— [Serj.] II. Three forward Fools at last they got, That in the Town liv'd near 'em, That were for Wedlock piping hot, So had no cause to fear 'em. The first a Chanter of Renown, A rank Sweet Singer in the Town, A Taylor and a grazing Clown, Soon won 'em, and must wear 'em. Bayes. So, observe, pray. [Serj.] III. My eldest Romp with Kid was grown, E'er scarce her Husband kist her, The Quean came just three Months too soon, And faith, so did her Sister. The third that was the Chanter's Spouse, Was such a plaguy toping Blouze, She'd sit and Quart by Quart Carowse. Whilst Day and Night he mist her. Bayes. So, good again— [Serj.] IV. The Taylor, plagu'd with Whore and Scold, Was once resolv'd to drown for't, The Grazier soon his Sheep had sold, And scamper'd up to Town for't. The Chanter did so strain his Maw To chime his tuneless Hum and Haw, If hang himself his Brethren saw, Not one would cut him down for't. Bayes. So—Ha, ha, ha. [Serj.] V. These goodly Sons of great Regard, All just as wife as loyal, To help Recruits may well be spar'd, And aid the Party Royal. My Daughters, as my Story tells, Can stitch or knit, or something else, And I with Pots can ring the Bells: Thus we shall live with Joy all. Bayes. Live with Joy all; Ha, ha, ha,—There's a merry Rogue for ye now. [Exit. Singer. Chant. Why, Gad, a merry Robin; I see he's a Plain-dealer. Smith. Robin does not stand upon the Honour of his Family, when Truth's in the Case. John. A filthy Bird, indeed! bewray his own Nest, out upon him! Bayes. Come, come, Sir, Robin has a farther Reach in his Noddle, than I perceive you have in yours; You know I told you, Friend Smith, before the Song, that he was a Serjeant as well as a Sutler. Smith. Right, Mr. Bayes, you did so—Thank'e heartily, you remember T. Chanter. Chant. Ay, ay. Bayes. Why then, to shew ye a Spice of Robin's good Apprehension, coming to Town himself to follow new Business; and finding his Rakehelly Sons-in-Law had left his Daughters, in Revenge procures a Friend of his to drill 'em in to list amongst the Recruits—Ha, ha, ha, as you found he gave a hint in his Song.—Odso, here comes one of 'em, the Sweet Singer, who has just taken the Money, and is coming from his Captain.—You shall hear his Humour presently. [Enter Sweet Singer.] Come, Sir, when you please. I. We Chanters of the loving Race, Nicknam'd harmonious People, Do far excel each Meeting-place, Or House that bears a Steeple. We preach in Tune, from Morn to Noon, Of Peace, and Love, and Conscience; We raise the Voice to swell the Song, And if it be but loud and long, 'Tis ne'er the worse for Nonsense. II. We crow, when we the Sisters move, Like Cock that Hen do's tread, Sir: And when the Union Note does move, We sing 'em straight to bed, Sir. We cant in Rhime, as loud we chime, As St. Sepulcher's Ringers: The Bagpipe with its Squeak and Drone, Or Parish-Clerk, with noteless Tone, Are Owls to us Sweet Singers. [Exit. Bayes. Ah, just as I would have it—The Notes are contriv'd so between the Tune of a Psalm, and the old venerable Ballad of Chevy Chase, that nothing can be more natural I'm sure. Smith. Very queint, and much out of the way, indeed, Sir. John. Of all good Sense and Musick, that I'll say for't. Chant. What's here, another of 'em? Enter Taylor. Bayes. Ay, Sir, they must make Haste in now, because the Act is long; and now, my crusty Sir, I will make bold to entertain you, as well as Mr. Smith here, whether you will or no; for this was design'd for none but those of the finest Taste: This Taylor since his coming to Town was happily lodg'd in a Garret, opposite to one of our principal Eunuchs, and having always a good Voice, has exactly learnt their manner; I have taken care to contrive the Words to be as full of Sense as any of their best Opera's; And don't doubt to have this darling Song frequently in the Mouths of all the Quality (that love these extream Finesses) in England. Come, the Recitative first, dear Mr. Pack. Sings. From Shopboard rais'd on high in Cross-leg'd Posture, From Toping off two Pots to raise new Vigour, I, from my Wedlock am, like Insect roving, To seek from yon Gay Tuba Rose fresh Odour. Bayes. Sweet, sweet—Now the Air—Now mind, Ah me, poor Lovesick humble Bee. John. How! Poet, prithee read right. Lovesick humble Bee, what a Devil— Bayes. Ay, Sir, Lovesick humble Bee—I'll justify it —Did not you hear him in the Recitative, speak of an Insect, and pray what more Musical, or capable of Passion than an humble Bee? Smith. By a Figure something may be made on't indeed. Chant. Ay, ay, he carps at every thing—pray go on. Bayes reads. Ah me, poor Lovesick humble Bee, That fly o'er Trees so tall and proper, To meet my tuneful Cowlady, And hear her sing an Air at Supper, And so forth, go on, dear Pack. Sings. Ah me, poor Lovesick humble Bee, &amp;c. Ah dearest Cow, Ah dearest Cow, Ah dearest, dearest, Cowlady, Since I by Fate am thine, Say then, sweet Hum, Sweet Buz and Hum, Sweet Hum and Buz, or Buz and Hum, I ever will be thine. [Bayes mimicks the latter part. Ah, if this does not strike the Intellect, farewel all charming Musick ifaith—I think my self a Disciple now of old Robin Car, that liv'd at the Temple-Gate; I'm ready to weep for Joy, egad. Smith. Now, Johnson, this I'm sure thou canst not carp at, for thou wert always an Admirer of the Italian singing. John. Why, I like the manner on't well enough. Chant. Ay, let the Words be what stuff they will, so there be but a Manner, any thing will go down— Ha, ha— Bayes. There, thou hast nickt him, faith, there's the right Taste of the Town—But come, now for the third Son-in-Law, the Grazier, and then the Act ends—Come, Grazier, let's hear your Country Ditty, tho' you were not so happy to enjoy the Effects. Enter Grazier. SINGS. I. A Country State, Tho' void of Treasure, Is form'd by Fate, The chiefest Pleasure. On flowry Downs, Fresh Breezes blowing, We hear sweet Sounds Of Oxen lowing. Our Sheep look fair, Our Lambs are bleating, Which great ones share, Such joy in Eating! And breeding when, Our Stock advances, We're happier than The King of France is. II. When hungry grown, When wet and weary, Then Rosie Jone Comes from her Dairy. A Feast of Curds, A Toast and Honey, Outvies what Lords Can get for Money. Good Beef does smoke In earthen Dishes, And from the Brook We've store of Fishes. A Spicy Pot Then do's us Reason, Would make a Cat To talk High-Treason. III. Kind Harvest got, If Ears are Cropping, We value not Whose Heads are Chopping. To crown Delight, Instead of roaring, We waste the Night In Love and Snoaring. I come from Work, Sweet Sleep is ready, And Jone i'th' Dark To me's a Lady. For when I'm close In sound Embraces, I laugh at Beaus Are making Faces. Bayes. Ay, gad, and let any of your fine Criticks laugh at that if he dares. Smith. Mighty natural really, Mr. Bayes. Chant. How Johnson stares at him—he's a little Nonplust at this. Bayes sings. I laugh at Beaus are making Faces—Come now the Country Dance; and then we'll go and see how they prepare the State-Scene within. [Dance here.] Very well; come, Sirs, now let's walk in a little. Smith., Chant. Nay, nay, no flinching, Faith, you shall go. [Pulling along Johnson. John. Pox on ye, are ye never to be tir'd? The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. The Scene opens, and the two Kings appear, seated with their Queens, all comically drest; Prince Volcius and Prince Prettiman guarded, attending by. Enter Bayes, Smith, Chanter and Johnson, as before. Bayes. Now, Gentlemen, I'll pretend to shew ye a right Scene of State. Appear Kings and Queens in your Royalty sitting in Judgment upon the Princes.—Prince Volcius, you are to speak first, pray begin, Sir—And therefore— John. How!—And therefore; Zoons, did ever any Prince's Speech before begin with—And therefore. Bayes. Prithee be quiet, Mr. What d'ye call'm—Gadzookers, you know I have told ye already these Matters are above the Sphere of your Country understanding. Pray don't be troublesome. Smith. Well, but under Favour, Mr. Bayes, as Johnson says, And therefore is a very odd beginning, unless they have been stating the Case before. Bayes. Before—why they are suppos'd to have talk'd so long within, that the Examination is quite over, the Queens impeach'd 'em, the Kings discuss'd the Matter, and the Princes made so notable a Defence, that they are now upon the Huff, and will get off, you shall see presently—by another Turn. And pray was not this better contriv'd, than a damn'd long Scene of fending and proving, that would tire the Audience as well as the Actors? Smith. Nay, if that were in his Head, Johnson. John. There is not so much in his Head as this pinch of Snuff, Begad. Bayes. Aw—never fear my making things plain, Mr. Smith—Go on, pray Friend, in Verse—And therefore— P. Vol. And therefore since our Honours have been soil'd, P. Prett. And Scandal has our florent Glory spoil'd. Both. Depend on't, Kings— [Angrily. Bayes. Look'e, I told you they were upon the Huff. Chant. This is indeed very Political, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Ay, Sir, they are no Fools,—pray mind,— speak now, you by your self. To P. Volcius. P. Vol. Depend on't, Kings,—our Breasts shall harbour Flame, 'Till we're acquainted, whence this Scandal came. P. Pret. 'Tis an Affront unto our Princely Race; Greater our Birth, the greater our Disgrace. Bayes. The greater the Disgrace; very well spoke indeed, Mr. a.—Now hear the Kings. 1 King. Kings cannot always judge where Right is due. 2 King. You were Impeach'd by those we thought spoke true; And if by erring Judgment we're misled, Stanch Satisfaction must atone the Deed. Bayes. That's now like a Man of Honour. 1 King. Let Guilt be cleans'd, and Innocence appear, We still as formerly shall wear you here; 2 King. Nor what we Eat or Drink, be half so dear. Bayes. So tender, so good, I have drawn these two Kings, the very Patterns of Clemency. John. Thou hast drawn a couple of damn'd Ideots, that's all I can see of 'em. P. Vol. Bring me the Caitiff here before my Face, Tho' made Impregnate, as Achilles was. P. Pret. Or bring some Female of renown'd Idea, Strong as the Warlike Queen Penthisilæa. P. Vol. Straight, in Seccoon, grim Death shall be his Lot, P. Pret. And with my Point, in Cart, I'll lay her flat. Bayes. My point in Cart, I'll lay her flat.—Is not that strong? Now han't those Verses fire in 'em, hah? Smith. Fire, ay; but pray, Mr. Bayes, take care it be lambent, won't the heat of your Metaphor offend the Ladies, think ye? John. I hope it will. Chant. Why Faith, as you say, that may be a little too free. Bayes. No, Sir, no; 'tis beyond their Apprehension, the Ladies have no Notion of Fencing, none in the World, Sir. —But now for the Turn, pray hear the Queens—Come, Mrs. a.—Oh! Words more sweet. [Teaching her in a Tone, 1 Queen. Oh! Words more sweet, than Honey that do's please The luscious Taste, when Farmers burn their Bees. 2 Queen. Oh! graceful Person, that where'er it moves, So charms the Eye, that she that sees it loves. Was I inchanted.—but I'll straight atone, And what I swore against 'em—I'll disown. 1 Queen. My Tongue shall never such dear Lives betray, What has been said—I'll turn another way. We'll chouse our Kings, 2 Queen. And make 'em soon obey. Begin the Musick—and let's have a Dance. [The Queen goes and whispers the Kings, who thereupon rise and smile on the Princes. Bayes. There's a Turn now for ye, Mr. Critick—Who would suspect this; the Queens on a sudden fall in Love with the Princes, and leading the poor Kings by the Nose—as what can't Women do? for the present invalidate the Evidence, and to divert 'em, call for the Musick; ha, ha, ha. John. Ay, pray Sir, is that like Women of Honour too, to forswear themselves? Bayes. Forswear themselves—Oons—why did not I tell ye they were in Love?—Honour, why they're mad, Sir, mad for Love—and a Queen or a Commoner, in such a Case, values an Oath no more than an Oyster-shell— Come, come, let's have the Musick; which to vary the Diversion, and entertain this Royal Assembly properly, shall be some Humours of a Court. Come, flourish there—and enter Groom of the back Stairs, and my young Widow, Lady Breakback. Enter young Irish Beau. Song here in Dialogue. He. I live at Court, and am in Grace, Distinguish'd for a Shape and Face; And blest with lucky Confidence, As well as some degrees of Sense, I've got a handsom Place; Yet this won't satisfy half my Ambition, Methinks I'm still in a sorry Condition. I want a Coach to roul and wander, And Twenty Thousand Pounds lies yonder; I want the Joy that daily crowns it, The buxom Widow too that owns it: That Bliss would be true Life endearing, And see, the Goddess is appearing. Enter Lady and Page. Now Irish dear Assurance teaze her, Inspire my Tongue to fawn and lye Of this, or that, or t'other Toy; Of Balls or Beaus, Or Gaudy Cloaths, Or any other thing to please her. Lady. Go bid the Chairmen wait, sure I shall come In good time now into the Drawing Room. He. Mine is good Time I'm sure, since now I can Such Excellence approach— She. What says the Man? He. The Man condemn'd by Love's Imperial Law, Says thou'rt the sweetest Woman! Oh! thou'rt the sweetest Woman! His Eyes yet ever saw. Those Planets blast me, oh, that Shape and Air, So fine, so charming, and that Face so fair; Like Sea-born Venus, do's inchant me so, I cannot move, nor can I let you go. She. Not let me go? He. Nay, now I'm sure I can't. My hearing that dear Note, As from sweet Philomell's melodious Throat, Do's more and more inchant. She. An odd bold prating Fellow—strangely rude, Sure you'll not force my stay? He. Divinely good!— Darling of Fate! by Love inspir'd and taught! She. What Nation you, and so much Flatt'ry brought? What gave you Birth? He. Dear Bogland. She. So I thought. No other Country durst have been so bold. He. A sign I'm made of a more mettled Mold. I've had a Vision, dearest Dear, That told me I should meet you here; Another Movement. Shew'd me what Wife the Fates had chose, Just such a Face, with such a Nose, Your Figure and your very Cloaths. I must, must seize my own! She. You saucy grow; Shall I not go to Court? He. To Court, no, no; You must go back to Church, a Priest and Ring, With Love and me, and a more charming Thing Shall please ye better, than the Court or King. She. I strive to go, and yet I hardly can, I'm charm'd, why sure the Devil's in the Man! His Impudence is into liking grown, Thus, thus, poor Widows, is your Weakness shewn. He. Now shine, my Irish Stars, and she's my own. She. My dull, sickly Husband, whom late I did wed, Three Years has enjoy'd me without e'er a Kid; And say what we will, we can never bear that, This Yonker, methinks, has a far better Lot. He'll tell me a Story, would surely prevail, And looks as his Argument never could fail. He. You must be mine, by Jove, d'ye think I'll be forsworn? She. An impudent young Rogue as ever sure was born; And yet, to argue freely, altho' the Phrase is course, I know not what do's ail me, I like him ne'er the worse. He. Joy shall regale my Widow, we'll frolick still in Mirth. She. And will you get me Children? He. Three fine Boys at a Birth. She. Away—you grand Deceiver. He. Try, try—my Love, my Life. She. And what if I should venture, He. Why then, my Dear, my Wife, Let's Wed just now, I tell ye, It ne'er can be too soon; I'll get thee a big Belly Before to morrow Noon. She. Od's Life, 'tis a Match. He. We'll the Proverb make out, The Marriage is happy that's not long about. She. You Courtiers but seldom a Jointure can spare, So I'll for a Kid give Three Thousand a Year. He. There's nought but thy Person can give me more Joy, For that's what I want, 'tis a folly to Lye. Chorus of both. Treble and Bass. He. Why then 'tis a Match, we'll the Proverb make out. She. Why then 'tis a Match, we'll the Proverb make out. He. The Marriage is happy that's not long about. She. The Marriage is happy that's not long about. He. We Courtiers but seldom a Jointure can spare. She. You Courtiers but seldom a Jointure can spare. He. So you'll for a Kid give Three Thousand a Year. She. So I'll for a Kid give Three Thousand a Year. He. There's nought but thy Person can give me more Joy. She. There's nought but thy Person can give me more Joy. He. For that's what I want, 'tis a Folly to Lye. She. For that's what you want, 'tis a Folly to Lye. Bayes. Well, now, Mr. Smith, pray deal faithfully with me; how dy'e like this Dialogue? Smith. Mighty well, indeed, Mr. Bayes, there's nothing wanting, and without doubt you have brought Johnson over now. Bayes. And what say you, Sir? Chant. Oh! good without Exception, I like it extremely. Bayes. As for you, Sir— John. Ay, Sir, as for me, I say it may pass for want of better. Bayes. Very good, troth—I think it may, Sir.—Yet, Gentlemen, to oppose ye all now—I must say—'tis not my Favourite; 'tis a good plain thing, and will down with easy Appetites; but not like our dear Cowlady, Mr. a—that was a Non Parelio, egad—Ah! that dear, dear Humble Bee! John. Buz— Chant., Smith. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Bayes. Come now for the t'other two little Songs that must be serv'd in as Pages to this Court Lady—This now, Gentlemen, is suppos'd to be a nice Character of a Maid of Honour. Come little Mrs. a—let's hear your Treble. Enter another Singer. SONG here, I. A Virgins Life who would be leaving, Free from Care and fond Desire; Ne'er deceiv'd, nor e'er deceiving, Loving none, yet all inspire. We sit above and Knot the live-long Day, A thousand pretty harmless things we say; But not one Word of Wedlock's frightful Noose, For fear we chance to think what we must lose. II. Our Souls are free from dire Revenges, Bosom's Mischief never owns; Our Wit's employ'd in making Fringes, Or embroidering our Gowns. If any Lover comes to play the Thief, Our natural dear Cunning gives Relief. We dance, we sing the tedious Hours away, And when we've nothing else to do—we pray. Bayes. Ah, well said, my little Dear; egad I'll kiss thee for that. [Kisses her, and Exit Singer. Smith. Why God-a-mercy Poet, Faith. Chant. Oh! she deserves—a small Fee certainly. John. If the Audience should chance to Clap here you'd see him as rampant as a Colt. Bayes. We must do so now and then to these young things to keep up their Spirits—Egad they'd flag in their Cadance, and sing out of Tune else. Come now for her Sister, another young Companion, or Confident, to this Court Lady. —Come enter little Lady Phæbe Finesse, she's ravingly in Love, you must know, with the Son of a great Duke— who, egad, they say, loves one of the Actresses—but Mum for that; and her Song is a Hue-and-cry after her Heart—'tis very quaint and odd you'll find; come Lady Phæbe. I. O Yes, O Yes, O Yes, I cry, Pray tell you gentle Swains are by, If you a roving Heart have met, Did lately from my Bosom get. II. Some Marks to shew it I'll express, It comes of loyal honest Race; By Nature kind, and prone to Love, And constant as the Turtle Dove. III. Upon the out-side of the same, You'll find the charming Damon's Name, By Love ingrav'd, and plain to shew, From which fresh Drops of Gore do flow. IV. 'Tis tender as soft Down can be, Or Beauty in its Infancy; Nor Wealth can make it e'er untrue, Such Hearts as mine you'll find but few. V. That 'twas confin'd, I late was told, Amongst the Lambs in Cupid's Fold; If so, pray seek that Deity, And carry this Resolve from me: VI. If he'll restore my Heart agen, I'll keep it from Deceits of Men; From wily Wits, and am'rous Tongues, And all that to their Sex belongs. VII. But if my Heart he'll me refuse, For 'tis a Jewel few would lose; Pray let him tell dear Damon this, And in Exchange command me his. And now for the Dance, the Dance Ænigmatical, Gentlemen, 'tis as full of Satyr, egad, as an Egg; for my Design in't, you must know, is to introduce at Court the Blessing of Concord—You shall see come first enter Concord, in her left Hand an Olive and a Myrtle Branch twining, in her Right a good Goblet of Lamb's-Wool. Enter Concord. Smith. So; but why Lambs-Wool, pray? Chant. Ay, that's a Novelty indeed. Bayes. Why, Sir, 'tis harmless Rural, and egad I think as pretty an Emblem of Amity and Friendship as any. John. Ay among Country Hobbs, that dance round their Appletrees at Christmas. Enter Six Figures comically dress'd. Bayes. Your Patience, pray Sir; so, now enter six foreign Figures representing Nations—Observe, pray mind this Fancy, 'tis notable I assure ye, for all of 'em have, or ought to have, Concerns with Concord there; look how they ogle her, some with Love-leers, and some with Indifference: The first in the Bear-skin there, is a damn'd cold frozen Fellow, a Muscovite, he cares not a Fox-tail for her. Chant. What's he there in Buff, with a black Crape Neckcloth on, and the blue Shirt, shewn with open Sleeves? Bayes. Why, Sir, he's a Swede, a plaguy mad hot brain'd rough Fellow; but the Muscovite having formerly thresh'd him, he's now a little upon the Morose; besides he's over-aw'd by the Turk that stands by him, who some time since paid for his Diet, and lent him Money. John. And what do's he take to now, pray? Bayes. Oh, Sir, sets up for a King of Piracy—lends his Fleet and an Army to make a Descent upon those that aspire to new Kingdom; all, all crack-brain'd, as mad as a very Devil, you must know. Chant. Then—the squab Fellow—that's a Dutch Hero, I suppose? Bayes. Sir, a Battavian, if you please; pray no vulgar Words; to say Truth, Mr. Smith, he's a difficult Creature, and was lately damnably averse to Concord—but he is sociable at last, provided 'tis profitable, and he may dance his own way. Smith. But pray what's he with the Whiskers? Bayes. Odso—softly—pray Sir, a High German—plaguy untractable too—and very angry with the Frenchman that's near him, whose old Master, it seems, before the present Regency, politickly gave his Grandson a rich Manor of Land that he thought he was Heir to; the Frenchman's a devilish cunning Fellow, and keeps things plaguy close, therefore I shall say little of him. Chant. Very well, now the last there, what's he? Bayes. He, ha, ha, ha; I thought you might have found him out by his Saturnine Phiz; why, Sir, he's a whimsical Englishman, his Humour just like the Seasons of his own Country, hot and cold, shining and storming in the space of half an Hour. Smith. He's a Rarity on my word. Bayes. He represents a Race that never could keep in with Concord, not suitable to their own volatile Fancies from the beginning of the World to this present time: but he'll make one amongst 'em now, you'll see, because he thinks he can do it with Honour, for a sham Peace has lately stuck upon his Gizzard plaguily. Chant. Methinks I long to see 'em proceed. Bayes. Come, all stand now in a Circle—and by turns drink of the Bowl. [They all drink.] Well done—why there's Concord now I think, in Perfection, and now we'll have the Dance—Stay—but first the Catch in three Parts, made for the Occasion—Begin. [Catch here. A Catch here in three Parts. I. Sound it o'er Albion, sound it high, Peace with Fame, or glorious War, British Sons unite with Joy And all defend great George's Crown. II. Raise up his Glory to the Sky, He now invites your Arms, prepare; Youth you can ne'er so well employ, And drive all false Pretenders down. III. France is renown'd for Feats of War, Thousands the German Braves have seen; Some the bold Muscovite will praise, But English Generals all excel. IV. Who has not heard of bold Villars? Who has not heard of great Eugene? Many the Czar's Renown do raise, But conqu'ring Marl'brough bears the Bell. V. Fill then the Glasses to the brim, Strong as the Wine let Courage be; Firm to your rightful Sovereign stand; For factious Foes let no one care. VI. Great George's Health, we'll drink to him, Then let it sound eternally: Three noble Bumpers in a Hand, Peace with Fame, or glorious War. Bayes sings. Peace with Fame, or glorious War.— Hey Boys, Gentlemen, your humble Servant, ye have oblig'd me to a high degree, egad. [To the Singers going off.] Come now the Dance, and then go off Kings and Queens, with the Princes, and drink your Chocolate. A humourous Dance here by the six Figures and Concord, and then Exeunt all but Bayes and the Gent. Smith. Most exquisite, I never saw a better Fancy. Chant. Very fine indeed. John. As fine as 'tis, Faith I'll go and take a Dish of Chocolate with the Queens—say what you please. Smith. We'll all go, and then come and hear the rest. Bayes. Aloons donc. [Exeunt. End of the second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. Enter Bayes, Chanter and Smith, he pulling in Johnson, who was going. Bayes. These toping Queens have given us a notable Touch of their Quality, egad, for they have whip'd off a Pottle of Chocolate, before a Couple of Subjects could have manag'd two Dishes—We must have Patience till more's made; therefore not to lose time, let's go on. Come, enter Princes with their Mistresses, Armorilis and Parthenope, Prince Volcius, you must know, has prov'd a very Roger the Constant, but as for Prince Prettyman, a former Love—. Enter Prince Volcius, Prince Prettyman, Armorilis and Parthenope. And a high point of Honour has made him swerve a little. Smith. Oh gad, I'm sorry for that with all my Heart. Chant. Methinks that's ungentleman like. John. Pish, thou art the Devil of a Fellow, hast no Mercy; have I not been tir'd enough? Oh! for a fine Spell, to hoist me through the Ceiling into the Air a little. [To Smith aside. Bayes. There's a Necessity for't, Gentlemen, the Plot will have it so. John. Whether you will or no, Ha!— Bayes. Ay, Sir, ay—Come Mrs.—a— Smith. That's very uncommon indeed. Chant. Hark, let's hear the Mistresses. Arm. Thus Joy is oft succeeding baleful Woe. Bayes. They have been talking, you must know, of their late Delivery. Arm. Thus Roses Spring, where Nettles once did grow. Since things, Sir, go so well, by general Voice, Let's to the Garden Grotto and rejoice. P. Vol. And give your timely Thanks, with silent Noise. [Exit Arm. John. Very obliging truly. Chant. Ay—I'll warrant her a good kind hearted thing. Smith. Ah, she has Reasons for't no doubt. Bayes. Private Matters must be settled, there has been Kindness between 'em a great while, you know: Now the t'other you'll find will be more sullen. John. And why so, pray? Bayes. 'Dsdeath, Sir, I won't tell ye: Oh! the insupportable Torment of Impertinence—Why here's to be another Turn, Sir—Go on, Prince Prettyman. John. The Devil take thee and thy Turns, I grow horribly Cropsick. P. Pret. Glory, sad Thoughts out from my Bosom root. John. Root, why do they grow there, like the Nettles she was speaking of? Smith. Nay, nay, Johnson, let the Metaphor have fair Play, don't murder it. Bayes. O Lord! O Lord! but hang't, I won't mind him —Come, prithee answer Mrs—a— Parth. Why is your Heart disturb'd—Why, Sir, so mute? Let's follow to the flowry Garden, With Tales of Love I'll soften all your Care. Bayes. Soften all your Care—Is not that a pretty Rogue? but now observe, now for the Turn. Come, Mrs. —a—Pray mind your Cue. [Bayes mimicks her. Enter Thimblessa, beckons Prince Prettyman, and goes out. P. Pret. Hah—She's here—nay then, The Fates will have it so, I'm call'd—And I Controul'd, by Honour's Laws, dare not deny. Go, Madam, take of amorous Thoughts your fill, I'll come—I'm busy—If I can—I will. [To Parthenope. Bayes. He's horribly disorder'd—damnably puzzled, but must have her. Smith. Ah, Pox, this is unkind 'faith. Bayes. 'Tis so, yet it can't be helpt, but you shall see a Salvo for't presently. Come, Enter Madam Fleabitten. [She comes in. Flea. Their Majesties the Queens, without Delay, Madam, desire you'll come and drink some Tea. [Exit. Parth. and Fleabitten. Bayes. Look'e there's some Honour to abate her Melancholly, however; why now you gape and stare, and I warrant wonder what this new Figure meant by her beck'ning, and why the Prince is so surly—Why in two Words then, this new Comer was his former Mistress; and when he was found to be but a Fisherman's Son—was his Sempstress—Kindness grew then, and Gratitude since to such a Head, that the Prince being a Man of Honour, is now in great Trouble of Mind—What's the Result you shall hear—Speak, Sir— P. Pret. She was the first I chose to be my Mate, Her Pains oblig'd me in my mean Estate; Honour says then to her, be not ingrate. I'll follow. [Exit. Bayes. So—very well,—let that pass; and now we must vary the Matter, by a short Scene of Politicks. Re-enter Fleabitten and Discipline. Put on a plotting look Mrs.—a—Consider you are a Piece of a Polititian—Come speak. Smith. She a Polititian! 'Dslife, Sir, I took her for a Chambermaid. Bayes. A Chambermaid! One of the Queens chief Women of the Bedchamber, as I hope to be fam'd—Was there ever so vile a Thought, considering the grand Family of the Fleabitten's? Besides, Ods Mortification, Death, and the Devil and all—Has this polite Person the sneaking Air of a Chambermaid? Chant. You see Smith's no Phisiognomist, Mr. Bayes. John. No, Pox on him, 'tis plain he said that to affront thy Work; faith Poet, if I were thee, I'd let him hear no more on't. Smith. Oh hang ye, why any Man breathing may mistake. Bayes. Mistake, ay gad, but that was a damnable one. Come speak, speak, she'll soon undeceive ye—or I'm mistaken. Flea. Well, Mr. Observator, what Intelligence have ye brought me now—Hah—What? Bayes. Hah—What! smart and pert, you may know by that she has been bred at Court. Flea. I assure ye, Sir, you have very ill supply'd me of late, and I never was so ashamed in my Life, as I was last Night; I was with some Ladies of Quality, of the first Rank of Phizgigs, who were almost sick for News, and never a considerable Lye to tell 'em—Oh fie, I shall lose my Reputation of a States-woman quite at this rate. Bayes. Very well, the Chambermaid you see, Sir, keeps pretty good Company; besides, I thought you might have found her out by some Matters that are past; why, ye dull Creatures, 'twas by her means that the Queens knew of the late Plot, the Priest there is in Love with her, and she manages his Secrets as she pleases—Ha, ha, ha. Chant. And betrays, I suppose, the t'other Boutfeu—What d'ye call'm, Belrope—Hah! Bayes. Ay, Sir, ay—Now ye have it; Ha, ha, ha. John. Has it; oh notably the Rogue hunts for a Jest, like a Ferret in a Coney-borrow; he makes it bolt whether it will or no. Discip. I heartily beg your Ladyship's Pardon, dear Madam; but I profess there has been a great Scarcity of News lately, and Invention, I think, freezes too; but however, incouraged by a Kiss from this fair Hand, I'll tell ye one topping thing. Smith. Sure, Mr. Bayes, this Person looks his part as you'd have him, for he gives her a very Amorous Oagle, methinks. [Discip. kisses her Hand. Bayes. Ay, Sir, I taught him that, I had it from a Priest in Flanders; the holy Rogue would look quite through a Wench, when the Fit was on him; besides, I told ye before, he was a plaguy Toad. Flea. Come, Sir, I wait impatiently. Discip. Why, look'e then, dear Lady—you may put it abroad when you please; that the two inveterate Parties, the Royalists and the Phizgigs are reconcil'd by the Grandees of the Bank and Stock-jobbers; and to crown their Amity, are all to have a great Custard-feast at my Lord Mayor's. Bayes. Ha, ha, ha,—pray hear him. Discip. In the next place, tell 'em this for great News, that the whole Body of London Jews, at the Instance of a Rabbi, who has lately been charm'd, by an Anthem sung by Monsieur de Sol re, at the Chapel, have unanimously agreed to build White-hall by the Model of Blenheim Castle; that the Quakers will provide Painting and Arras Hangings, who being weary of their former slovenly Garb and Formality, resolve from henceforth to wear Pantaloons and Ribbons. Bayes. Ha, ha ha,—there's News for ye. Flea. Thank'e, Sir, this is something; the Devil's in 'em that won't take this for a well-grown Lye. Smith. The Devil's in 'em indeed, why this will cram the Maw of the Town for at least a Month. Chant. Ay, and make a strange buz in the Coffeehouses. John. He's mad by these ten Pickers and Stealers, as Hamlet says. Bayes. Shrewd, shrewd, egad. I warrant it flies about like Lightning; Ha, ha, ha.—Now pray hear her Conclusion of the Scene. Flea. And now, Friend, observe—You shall find that I have something to inform you—Come, I intend to closet ye about it; I know you Priests love Closet-work; you shall know then, that our Politick Ladies have certain Advice, that their High Mightinesses have generously resolv'd to give us up our Herring Trade, and lend us all the Money they got by the late War, taking our Tally Bills for the Repayment. Come, Oily-fist, come in and you shall know more. [Slaps him on the Shoulder. Discip. Ay, with all my Heart, sweet Honey-suckle; ods Sugar-sops—I melt like May Butter; rare, rare News, and I'll spread it about ifack. Bayes. There's a Scene now; there's Politicks and Wit together for ye. Smith. This new Character shews Roguery enough, I confess. Chant. Ay, there's a double entendre in't too, if we could hit it, hah, Johnson. John. Pox, I was listning to the Fiddle; don't disturb me. [Fiddle within. Bayes. Oh—now for the third Entertainment: They're tuning I find; a Scene of new Variety still, which will be shewn in another little Masque, explaining the Humours of the City—Come, first enter Discord, a Figure very well acquainted there at present, and with him [Enter Discord. and three Figures] three Figures more, Bigotry, in the Habit of a Jesuit; Faction in the Garb of a Fanatick; and Stubbornness drest like a Quaker. Smith. I marry, Sir, this gives an Idea of some Diversion indeed! Smith. I warrant ye, Sir— [Song begins here. The first Song, in the third Masque, represented in the Figure of Discord drest like a City Stock-jobber. Bold Discord is my Ancient Name; My Title too of greater Fame; The City can it well explain; A sly notorious Knave in Grain, A wheadling Party Robber. No Brain has in't more Turns of Wit, When there is any thing to get; More learn'd in City Politicks, Nor can a Monkey do more Tricks, Then I, a true Stock-jobber. [Bigotry, Faction and Stubborness appear. Second Movement. My Sons here still are worse, A Nation's greatest Curse; Who boldly in Disguise Make Religion cloak their Vice, Who boldly, &amp;c. When Stock does rise, Then to the Skies, Their airy Hopes are flying; But if it falls, Down goes St. Paul's, Their Church and they are dying. And tho' they, like Saints, will dissemble with many, They're Devils, mere Devils, at the turning the Penny. A dull quaking Moper, A Mass Interloper, With them a blew Practice of Piety Groper. Who quarr'lling and snarling, And biting and fighting, Would make their Commotion A Case of Devotion. Would make, &amp;c. When, oh, 'tis Money, that grand Devil, Money, Money, that grand Devil, Is the Root of all their Evil, And though their ill Lot, Their own Vices begot, The Crown and the Government must be in Fault. The Crown, &amp;c. The next is the Comical Dialogue between Bigotry, dress'd like a Jesuit; Faction, like a Fanatick; and Stubbornness, like a Quaker. Big. The stubborn Sons of Alba can't agree, Or else they sure would ne'er make use of me: And to promote their Jars I now am come, To aid 'em like a true-bred Son of Rome: For so, in spite of all their Laws, I'll be, As by my shaven Crown, Friends may in private see. Faction comes up and observes him. Fact. Bless me! oh bless me! if my Sight's not gone, I see a Type o'th' Whore of Babylon. As I'm a Protestant, 'tis so; Tho' banish'd, yet they will not go. He shew'd me his shorn Pate, But I may profit by the Beast; I'll go and peach him for a Priest, So get the Rogue's Estate. [Is going, and Stubbornness stops him. Stubb. Hold, Friend, pray hold—by what I've heard, Thou want'st a brotherly Regard; Thy Mind's in some Confusion; Now plainly, if thou wilt be wise, I may—Hum—give thee some Advice. And bring things to Conclusion. Big. You may, Sir, as well Keep Noise from a Bell, His Soul is compounded of Jargon; For as bred among Bears, This Rogue stops his Ears At the ravishing Sound of an Organ. Fact. I must confess that Pagan Tone, Is worse to me than Bagpipe Drone. 'Tis Popish and I cannot bear it. Movement changes. Stubb. Nay, Friend, thou then can'st err, I see; For Soundings may harmonious be, Through Motions of the Spirit. And when a Sister mounts on high, And pants and speaks with Ectasy Then, hum—good lack how sweet's the Voice! Fact. When you in Revolution doze, Big. And you are canting through the Nose, Stubb. Our Babes of Grace rejoice, Fact. Our stanch Opinion grounded is on Sense, We shew nor Miracles, nor Peter Pence. Big. Nor do we, when our Nonsense plagues the Town, Require a buxom Lass to rub us down. Stubb. We hate the Wantons that to snare us come, And in our own Tribe mingle with a Hum. Big. Fanatick, leave off your dull Stuff, and your Twang, Fact. Sir Priest, if you're sawcy I peach and you hang. Stubb. Nay surely you're Vipers of Satan's own Seed, And should be destroy'd to extirpate the Breed. I'll cause our Brethren soon to join, And both your Sects we'll undermine; We'll vouch you'll root out Monarchy; For tho' not swear, we all can lye. Stubb. I know ye all are Fiends—at grand Hypocrisy. Big. The Canters all shall down, but plainly for thy part, I know thou art for Masses, a Jesuit in thy Heart; So thou shalt scape the Lash, most of thy Tribe are so. Stubb. Plainly thou lyest—ah me, the Spirit moves me now. We never, we never will put up this Wrong, The King shall comply, we are Legion and strong. Fact. We'll manage the Court till the Jesuit we hang, Big. We'll work, like the Mole, 'till the Canter we hang. Stubb. We'll mutiny strongly till both of ye hang. Fact. The Jesuit shall hang. Stubb. The Canter shall hang. Big. The Quaker shall hang. Chorus of all. We never, we never will put up this Wrong, The King shall comply, we are Legion and strong, [They all fall a fighting, and so go off. Bayes. There, there, a hay—Oh rare Fanatick, well done Jesuit, oh rare Quaker—there's Mob Commotion for ye, there's Hurry and Bustle to the Life—egad. Discor. Halloo, halloo, halloo. [Shouts 'em on. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha.— Bayes. Come, now enter to Discord, Envy and Jealousy, the one dress'd like an old superannuated Chambermaid, the other like a supercillious Italian. [They enter. Envy sings. From gloomy Realms of Night ascending, And the fatal Lethes Shore, Thus new Mischiefs still attending, We are come to aid thy Power; Envy and dire Jealousy, With potent Discord ever must agree. Discord. Whilst baleful Feuds Mankind annoy, Hymens Rights too we'll destroy, Women may count Love a Joy. Smiling, Crying, Whining, Lying, Of another kind am I. I am sworn Foe to all his Law do's bind, Marriage from first Creation was design'd, A Curse intail'd on wretched human Kind. 'Tis noble Discord, generous strife That gives the truest Taste of Life. Marriage first made Man fall, Had I been in the Garden plac'd, The Woman ne'er had made him taste, 'Twas foolish loving damn'd us all. Envy. Let that Humour last for ever, Discord's Rules to fix endeavour, Let all Nature have a Fever. Jealous. Alba's Court molest with Jarring, All their Joys and Pleasures marring, Let there be perpetual Warring. Or if zealous Pangs are worse, Vex 'em with that heavy Curse. Discord. Let the Elements conspire, Sea and Air, and Earth and Fire: Let loud Thunder cleave the Sky, Let the blasting Lightning fly; Storms of Hail, and gusts of Rain Deluge o'er the flowry Plain: All things in Confusion bring, To raise new Jars and bloody Wars; And without Cause, in spite of Laws, join to molest the King. I am the lofty Power Commands all these, Imprison'd Winds can from their Bonds release. And from Æolian Caverns free, Whenever Mischief's to be done you may be sure of me. Envy. And me. Jealous. And me. Discord. Search both the Globes you ne'er shall find there's such another Three. Chorus. Search both the Globes, &amp;c. Bayes. Very well; now you shall hear Envy give ye her own Character. Envy. By Fortune cross'd, and Love betray'd, I liv'd 'till Seventy five a Maid, And now in Hell have Envy's Place, Because condemn'd to single State, When all but I had got a Mate, It fill'd me with such mortal Hate, I would have poyson'd all the Race. Below or here, where-e'er I am, I study to defame; To Reputation mortal Foe, but constant Friend to Shame. I slander all Wit, And a Face that is sweet, I wish the Small-Pox, or much rather the Great, Sword, Fire and Ruin to those that have Wealth, And a Pest of Blue Plagues upon all that have Health. The Soldier I wish for his Laurel wore Thorns: And he that as Life Loves his beautiful Wife, Oh! send him, great Pluto, a huge pair of Horns. I still have a Pang when Contentment I see, And Merits Reward when 'tis duly prepar'd, Is a Torment to me, is a Torment to me. Bayes. There's Envy for ye—there's a Touch for all old Maids, egad. Ha, ha, ha. Come now for Jealousy. Hark'e, a Word by the by; I would fain have persuaded her, you must know, to fall in Love, or to drink a Gallon of Vinegar every Day for a Month, as the Jockeys do, to make her waste and grow hagged, that she might look her part well; but a Pox on her 'twou'd not do. Ha, ha, ha. Jealousy Sings. From hot Italian Progeny, A Mixture form'd of Blood and Phlegm, Of both in the extreme, Dame Nature first compounded me; In Pluto's Court I took my first Degree And Title there of Jealousy, From my suspicious Nature; So plagu'd I was with base Mistrust, And with such vile Opinions curs'd, I thought my Ruin doom'd by every Creature. Hence made I Jars in Families, Disturb'd the Virtuous and the Wise; Infested oft a happy State, And rais'd Commotions 'mongst the great; And when on Earth in Wedlock joyn'd, I teaz'd to death a Wife, young, chaste, and kind: Strong Fetters, Bolts and Bars Could not secure my jealous Fears. I had a hundred Eyes all gazing round in vain, A thousand, and ten Thousand Plots and Whimsies in my Brain. A Thousand, &amp;c. Envy. Let's go, let's go, and human Peace destroy. Jeal. To trouble all the World will cause our greater Joy. Discord. If they Love we'll cause a Jangling, If they Wed we'll force a Wrangling, If they Friendship chuse to guard 'em, Wealth or Women shall divide 'em. Envy. If with Politicks infected, Jeal. One shall t'other make suspected; Envy. And tho' nought appears to wrong 'em, Discord. Discord still shall reign among 'em. [Exeunt Singers. CHORUS of all. If with Politicks, &amp;c. Bayes. Very well; so now go off, and then enter a Dance of Professions, and so conclude the Act. Ah— very well done, egad. [Dance here. Smith. 'Tis so indeed—they have acquitted themselves extremely well. Chant. Come—and now for another Dish, the Boy is there by this time. Bayes. With all my Heart—tholl, loll, loll. [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. Enter Bayes and Gentlemen, as before. Bayes. Now, Gentlemen, to take hold again of the Thread of my Plot: In the first place here must be a Scene of Love and Honour, between Prince Prettiman and his old Mistress; she beckon'd to an Assig— you remember, some time since—Come, enter Prince Prettiman and Thimblessa. [They come in.] She's jealous, you must know, and will now give ye an Opportunity to see her Mettle. Come—in Verse. P. Prett. Of all the Ills with which the World is curst, Believe me, Fair One, Jealousy's the worst; 'Tis a Disease of the most baleful kind, And therefore call'd the Jaundice of the Mind: 'Tis always spreading like a Canker sore, That eats, and eats—hum [Boggles as out of his Part. John. 'Till it can eat no more. Bayes. Gadzookers, I'll throw down the Book—Eat no more, there's no enduring this—no, Sir.—'Till it does all devour, are my Words. P. Pret. I beg Pardon, Sir,—'till it does all devour. Bayes. Allusion—d'ye mind, Mr. Smith, a rare Figure in Poetry—eat no more—but come go on, Prince, ne'er mind. Smith. No, no,—he's craz'd, I believe. Chant. Ha, ha, ha. P. Pret. Forego it, Madam, if I share your Love. Thim. You I held dear, Witness the Powers above. Dear as the Foal do's her indulgent Dam, Or as the tender Ewe, the frisking Lamb. [Bayes repeats after her. Bayes. Soft, tender, sweet. P. Pret. And I the bright Thimblessa, Dear, as kind Hostess, the frank Guest will pay, Or the stale Maid her joyful Wedding Day. Bayes. Or the stale Maid her joyful Wedding Day. [Mimicking.] O! egad there's four Similes tell him, worth the four Thousand Pound, he goes to Law for, and a better Penny. Chant. Very passionate indeed, Mr. Bayes. Smith. Oh! Very soft, very tender. Bayes. And yet this won't do, she's damnably yellow for all this, and you'll find will do the Devil and all of Mischief. Thim. No, Prince, to hide it, weak is your Essay, I know your Heart is with Parthenope: What has she done, that can compare with me? Did not, when Fate and you could not agree, These pliant Hands sow all the Pieces in Of many a Lockram Stole, worn next your Skin? Did not my small Steel Engine piercing through, Oft prick these Fingers to give Ease to you? Bayes. My small Steel Engine—Her Needle, ha, ha, ha. —I told you, if you remember, she had been his Semptress. John. Ay, you did so—thank'e. Bayes. Phoo,—pray, Gentlemen, mind this—'tis very pretty, Faith. Thim. Was not my Person— P. Pret. Well, I know 'twas fine. And did I not oblige ye too with mine? Did I not, to be grateful, every Day, Besides Endearments, give you half my Pay? Bayes. And honourable enough, egad; for you must know, by the by, that the Prince was no better than a Dragoon at first, tho' afterwards he came to be a great General. Thim. You then were true, but now those Days are o'er, You're false, [Eagerly. and have forget the Oaths you swore, Like mellow Fruit, y'are rotten at the Core. Parthenope—Furies and Fire— I'll cram her Throat with burning Coals like Portia, With Asps like the Ægyptian Queen, with Daggers Like Roman Lucrece: Revenge, Revenge, Justice, And dire Revenge!— [Rages and Exit. Bayes. Hermione in perfection, ha, ha, ha; she's gone to plot Mischief, but 'tis opportunely enough, because I wanted her Absence to bring in another great Scene and Dance; for if she should know the Queens are in Love with him too, there would be no enduring her egad. P. Pret. Oh! Women veering like to April Weather, Now shining, storming now, and sometimes neither. [Exit P. Pret. John. That's Nonsense, begad. Bayes. Egad, Sir, 'tis as Tragedy Verse should be.— Adapt and Elevate, and I'll justify it—Come, draw the Scene there. Chant. Ay, ay, 'tis mighty well—let him say what he pleases. The Scene opens and discovers the two Queens seated with Prince Volcius, Guards attending. 1 Queen. What turn of various Fate has chanc'd to Day, So long has kept Prince Prettiman away? 2 Queen. His long'd-for Company has caus'd our Fear, Depriv'd of having it no longer here; P. Vol. Than whom a braver Prince could not appear. Bayes. So well bred—so like a Prince. [Re-enter P. Prettiman. John. So like a Sow-gelder! 1 Queen. Advance this way, fair Prince, and sit by me. 2 Queen. Sit by us both, or we shall ne'er agree. Smith. Their Majesties are very much smitten, I find, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Oh, Sir, to the last degree. Chant. Oh! Love, Love's a mighty Tyrant, Love makes a Queen as supple as a Sempstress. P. Prettiman goes and sits on t'other side of the Queens. 1 Queen. What need you press so to invite him on? 2 Queen. Nay, what need you?—But more of that anon. John. Oh! the Devil, can my Stomach hold yet? Bayes. There will be a thundering Scene between 'em presently, and this is to give a Hint of it before; they are damnably jealous, I told ye; here will be rare Work; but first we must have the fine Court Dance, or Entry. [Dance here. The Dance ended they all rise, and come forward; the first Queen takes both the Princes aside and speaks. 1 Queen. Within my Cabinet a Book you'll find, The Owner on't will not be far behind. P. Pret. Your blest Commands do's so much Honour give, That who delays 'em—not deserves to live. P. Vol. Business avaunt, and trifling Fortune wait, Your Pleasure is Disposer of my Fate. [Exeunt Princes. Bayes. Now here is the oddest Passage, I'll be bold to say, Gentlemen, and the newest, that ever was seen in a Play; they are each of 'em in Love with both the Princes—hum! is not that new now? Smith. Yes, truly. John. Oh, very new—very new—a Plague on't. Bayes. Hush—look, look; do but see how they lowr at one another. 2 Queen. Your Highness will, I hope, except my Love, To wait ye to the Door of your Alcove; That when you with the Princes there resort, No other may intrude to spoil the Sport; But think not that I mean the thing I say, [Raising her Voice. No, Wretch, 'tis I their Hearts can only sway. 1 Queen. That you can sway, you insolently think, But if you do, 'twill be when they're in drink: Once I remember, at a Warrior's Feast, When raising of the Siege a Town releast, And they of Wine, the Soldiers Recompence, By gulping up too much, had banish'd Sense; Their heedless staggering Steps were turn'd to you, For which, by Jove my Hatred is their due; And I'll renounce 'em—yet methinks I'm loth. Bayes. Yet methinks I'm loth. [Softly mimicking her.] Pray mind, here's a luscious Metaphor coming. 1 Queen. They are sweet Men, tho' I have made this Oath, Their Bodies clean from Pimples and from Sores, And Rosa Solis—issues from their Pores: They kiss more soft than Nurse do's Infant fair, Who turns its soft Posteriors to the Air. Bayes. Ah—gad, the Image of that strikes ye through I'm sure. Smith., Chant. Ha, ha, ha, ha. John. Ha, ha, ha.—Gad would thou were't to kiss the Infant with the Image—that I have of it. 2 Queen. Worth of such Pleasures, I the best can tell, Since 'tis with me that only they excel. 1 Queen. With you, hah, am I then for Mildness mock'd? Madam, take care I'm not too far provok'd. Bayes. Now—now—she's nettl'd, now they begin. 1 Queen. A burning Blush o'er all my Face has got, And glows just like an Ov'n that's over hot. 2 Queen. Then with fresh Bavins I'll new Heat inspire, With crackling Jealousy increase the Fire; For to my Closet know they both are gone, And happy I too, shall be there anon: Matters of State must be consulted there, Affairs you too ill fated are to share; And whilst in Politicks, commix'd with Joy, My Volcius dear, my Prettiman and I Regale in unexampled Ecstasy: You like the Cooing Dove shall perch alone, And doz'd with anxious Thought, sob, sigh, and groan. 1 Queen. I thank thee, that thou dost my Anger move. [Raging. Bayes. Now, now, now. 1 Queen. To feed Revenge I'll turn again to Love. 2 Queen. You Love! sure petty Titmouse you'll not dare, [Loudly. 1 Queen. Yes, Steel devouring Ostrich, but I dare. [Starting up to her. Jealousy burns, and I'll be so reveng'd—I will, I will, I will— [Stamps and rages. Bayes. Ah, Statira for that, efaith. 1 Queen. I'll meet the Princes—spite of all I swore, And grasp—that thou may'st never touch 'em more. [Exit and t'other swiftly after her. Bayes. Go your ways for Non Parelio's, egad,—There's for ye, Gentlemen,—some of the dull carping Vulgar now may think this no better than Scolding betwixt the two Queens; but let me tell 'em, 'tis one of the brightest Ornaments has been in our modern Tragedies—for many Years. Smith. Nay I must needs say, Mr. Bayes, this last Scene was very brisk and spritely. Chant. It was so. John. Phoo, Pox, the Conceit is stole—I have seen it before twenty times. Bayes. Before! not in so fine a Dress, I hope, good Seignior Carper; a late Heroick Author, 'tis true, once aim'd at such a Scene, but mine is so much better, that Gadzooks I'm asham'd to speak on't—Now then, for another Surprize, which you shall have eternally in this Act—The Queens being involv'd in a violent Passion, have been so loud, that the two Kings being alarm'd by their Noise in Alt, coming into the Antichamber heard all, and order'd their Guards to seize 'em; the two Princes hearing on't have escap'd, so that now they are reckon'd as Delinquents agen —Gadzooks the Plot thickens so very much it makes me sweat. Come, enter Kings and Queens—Come. Enter the two Kings and the Queens, guarded with Belrope, Discipline, Tokay and Fleabitten. Oh! Wedlock! 1 King. Oh! Wedlock, what is worse than thy Estate? 2 King. What greater Plague than a deceitful Mate? Have we for this been to small Mischiefs blind, With Patience born the Yoke of Womankind! 1 King. But a due Punishment we'll not delay, Confine 'em close 'till we have thought the Way. John. What are these Fellows Kidnap'd already too? [Exeunt Queens guarded. Bayes. Yes, Sir, and what have you to say to that? Sir, let me tell ye, there's nothing like Dispatch in a Plot; yet 'tis only the Libeller there, and the Secretary that are to be punish'd; the Priest and the Damsel have betray'd 'em, so they have impeach'd, and the others are to be maul'd. Ha, ha, ha, 1 King. These Criminals may now have leave to speak. [The two Kings go and sit in Chairs. 2 King. Upon our selves we will their hearing take. 1 King. In th'first place what are you? 2 King. In th'next place—you? Bayes. Now this is formal, you must know, as judiciary Matters should be; I took this Hint from a grave Justice of Peace, who began his Examination of Criminals just so: Begin agen, pray Mr—a—. 1 King. In th'first place what are you? 2 King. In th'next place—you? Tok. Me's Catolique. Bel. For Money—I'm a Jew. Flea. For my part I'm a Protestant true Blue. Discip. I'm Shorn, and should be hang'd,—had I my Due. Bayes. Pithy and short; I make 'em confess to avoid the Inconvenience of a tedious Examination—And indeed the true Design of this Scene is to let the World know what plaguy Vermin some of these News-mongers are, and what Mischief they do the Government—Proceed, Mr—a— Discip. In short, Brother Incendiary, there is no way to incline their Majesties to Mercy but plain Confession; I have done't already, and Thanks to this good Lady here, am much lighter in Conscience. Flea. 'Tis true, Monsieur, and therefore to second him will be your best way. Are not you a Spie, Transub— heh? Tok. Me must maka no Lye at de Confession.—Yes, truly, me have bin de ver great Rascal—but me receave de Bribe from him—dat is ver true. [Points to Belrope, 1 King. When did you publish any true News, Sirrah? [To Belrope. Bel. Egh, sick, sick—not this forty Years.—Oh! it comes up very hard. Bayes. Some Peoples Consciences fly in their Faces; I make this Fellow's now plague his Stomach; Men and Times alter strangely, Mr. Smith, and the Politicks of the Coffee-house out-do those of the Council clearly. Smith. The Lyes that are vented there, indeed, do more Mischief in a Government than the Politicians generally do it good. Bayes. Ay, you shall hear, this is, I think, drawn to the Life.—Come out with it Belrope. 2 King. No more Delays, Vermin, but if you expect Clemency, deserve it by Confession. Bel. Oh! if you must have it upthen,—for the Quiet of my Conscience and Ease of my Stomach, I confess I was bred up in Knavery, and born, I believe, with a Lye in my Mouth; as soon as I could speak I told it—and as soon as I could write committed it to Paper.—I have slighted the Lords, slander'd the Commons, abus'd the City, banter'd the Country, affirm'd some to be Dead were that instant playing at Picket, and others alive that I saw just before put into their Graves. In fine, my Joy has been this forty Years, To set the World together by the Ears. Oh! Mercy, Mercy, I beseech your Majesties. Bayes. There's a Fellow for ye now.—Begad if that not a topping Character, as Times go, adieu to all Genius ifaith. Chant. Odso, the crowding Business in this Act has put you into a Heat, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Oh! sultry, sultry; I must unbutton my Waste-coat. John. 'Sdeath, I have been in a Bath these two Hours,— would these Kings would give Judgment, that the Court might break up. 1 King. Break up the Court, we'll think on what is said, Oh, Brother, 'tis the Queen most plagues my Head; 2 King. And mine too, but we'll drink, and then to Bed. [Belrope, Discip. and Tokay are carried off. [Exeunt Kings and Guards. Bayes. I told ye these Kings were to be admir'd for their Clemency, it has been the fine way of Writing for many Years; but come, after this Glut of serious Business 'tis fit to bring in some Diversion; now therefore you shall have the fourth Entertainment, some Humours of the Country: Come, strike up; the first is an amorous Shepherd declaring the Power of Beauty and Love.—Come, Sir. Enter a Shepherd. SONG. When Beauty will its Power pursue, What cannot charming Woman do? The Warrior must abate his Rage, 'Twill make his Sword quite lose its Edge: 'Twill make the Students slight their Rules; 'Twill make the Statesmen look like Fools: The greatest Prince 'twill make a Slave; The Niggard lavish, Coward brave: Trajan's, Nero's, Captives, Hero's, All must truckle and come too, When Beauty will its Power pursue. What cannot charming Woman do, When Beauty, &amp;c. Bayes. So, now comes in his Wife to do her part; I design'd this, you must know, as a true Model of Conjugal Affection; and to be sung by all new Brides and Bridegrooms at least the first Week, for fear they should not like the Tune on't afterwards. Enter a Shepherdess. Smith. Happily contriv'd, indeed. John. Oh, wonderful! the marry'd Tribe will be much oblig'd to him. Chant. Prithee let's hear—no carping beforehand. SONG II. Chloris. I. Since I my Damon's Passion know, And he his constant Chloris; To yonder Covert let us go, Where Zephir's Breezes gently blow, And tell our Am'rous Stories: The Thrush and Nightingale are there, O'er Rosie Bed is near 'em, Who Sing and Warble without Fear, Rejoicing that we hear 'em. Damon. II. There, there the fragrant Woodbine grows, The Jessamin sweet embracing; The Orange and the Tubarose, Of which a Chaplet I'll compose, My eager Love expressing. Close by, a Silver Spring do's rise, And purling glide at Leisure; There will I gaze on those fair Eyes, 'Till Sense is lost in Pleasure. Bays Sings. 'Till Sense is lost, &amp;c.—Ah! dear Creature, egad, I'm almost in Love with thee my self, [Exeunt Singers.] but only here are others coming, and so I'm forc'd to divide my Love between 'em.—Come, now enter Cremisa, a Country Milk-maid, who sings a right Ballad in its natural Purity; 'tis of her Sister, and how she balk'd an amorous Knight, a Courtier, who most barbarously made an Attempt to get her Maidenhead.—Here's Variety for ye still, Gentlemen: Come, my Dear. Enter a Milk-maid. SINGS. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, The Linnet, Nightingale and Thrush, Sate on the fresh green Hauthorn Bush; And jug, jug, jug, and twee, twee, twee, Most sweetly they did sing. I. All you that either hear or read, This Ditty is for your Delight; 'Tis of a pretty Country Maid, And how she serv'd a Courtly Knight. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. II. This Courtly Knight, when Fields were green, And Sol did genial Warmth inspire; A Farmer's Daughter late had seen, Whose Face had set his Heart on Fire. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring. III. Oft to her Father's House he came, And kindly was receiv'd there still; The more be added to his Shame, Since only 'twas to gain his Will. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. IV. One Evening then, amongst the rest, He came to visit this good Man; But needs must know where Clara was, And heard she was a Milking gone. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. V. Then call'd he for his pamper'd Steed, With Pistols at his Saddle Bow; And to the Meadow rode with Speed, Where she was milking of her Cow. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. VI. Then down he lights, and ties his Horse, And swore she must his Pain remove; If not by fair Means, yet by Force, Since he was dying for her Love. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. VII. The pearly Tears, now trickling fall, And from her fair bright Eyes do flow; But that he heeded not at all, But do's her strait the Pistols shew. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. VIII. But first pull'd out a fine gay Purse, Well lin'd within, as she might see; And cry'd, before it happens worse, Be wise, and take a golden Fee. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. IX. Oh! keep your Purse, reply'd the Maid, I will not take your golden Fee; For well you hope to be repaid, And greater Treasure take from me. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. Bayes. So, hold, hold; enough, enough;—I consider'd the Story, tho' 'tis altogether pleasant, would be too long, and perhaps pall the Audience, and so cunningly design'd the Conclusion for the next Act. Smith. Oh! why so, Mr. Bayes;—no, no, prithee let's have it out, I don't think it tedious at all. Chant. Oh! out with it, by all means;—tedious, 'tis very novel and divertive. Bayes. Nay, egad, I'll be upon sure Ground;—I'll have Leave of the Audience.—If they say ay, she shall proceed, not else,—I'll not be hiss'd at for being tedious, I'm resolv'd: What say ye, Gentlemen, shall she go on or no? X. A thund'ring Oath then out he sent, That she should presently be Dead, For were his Heart not eas'd, he meant Point blank, to shoot her thro' the Head. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. XI. Then making Haste to seize her went, And laid the Fire Arms at her Feet; Whilst Clara seeing his Intent, Has no recourse to Aid but Wit. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. XII. She feigns a Smile, and clinging close, Cry'd out, I've now your Courage try'd; You've met no simple Country Mouse, My Dear, you shall be satisfy'd. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. XIII. My Father takes me for a Saint, Tho' weary of my Maiden Geer; That I may give you full Content, Pray look, Sir Knight, the Coast be clear. Chorus. 'Twas in the flow'ry Spring, &amp;c. XIV. Look out, and see who comes and goes, And you shall quickly have your Will, For if my Father nothing knows, Then I shall be a Maiden still. Chorus. 'Twas in the, &amp;c. XV. The witless Knight peeps o'er the Hedge, As one well pleas'd with what he heard, When she do's both the Pistols snatch, And boldly stood upon her Guard. Chorus. 'Twas in the, &amp;c. XVI. Keep off, keep off, Sir Fool, she cry'd, And from this Spot of Ground retire, For if one Yard to me you stride; By my sav'd Maidenhead I fire. Chorus. 'Twas in the, &amp;c. XVII. My Father once a Soldier was, And Maids from Ravishers would free; His Daughter too in such a Case, Can shoot a Gun as well as he. Chorus. 'Twas in the, &amp;c. XVIII. For Sovereign too, when Foe invades, Can on occasion bravely kill, Not shoot like you at harmless Maids; That won't obey your savage Will. Chorus. 'Twas in the flowry Spring, &amp;c. XIX. Who when the good old Man, whose Cheer, Shew'd welcome, tho' of little Cost, A Rape thought on his Daughter dear, Most grateful way to pay your Host. Chorus. 'Twas in the, &amp;c. XX. Go home ye Fop, where Game's not dear, And for half Crown a Doxey get, But seek no more a Patridge here, You cou'dn't keep, tho' in your Net. Chorus. 'Twas in the flowry Spring, &amp;c. XXI. At this the Knight look'd like a Mome, He prays, he sues, yet vain was all; She soon convey'd the Trophies home, And hung up in her Father's Hall. Chorus. 'Twas in the flowry Spring, &amp;c. Bayes, Very well—thank'e Sweet-heart, 'tis a little of the longest—but the Relish and Story in't shall vie with all the Opera Trillo's in Europe, egad—Come, now the last Dialogue—And the Dance, and so end the Act. Smith. Why, well said, thou spar'st no Pains, I must say that. Bayes. I think so, this now expressing another sort of Accident relating to Country Matters—is the intended Plunder of a Cottage in time of War, and sav'd from the rough Officer, by the modest Virtue of two pretty Farmers Daughters, whom I make him fall in love with—Hey—call Robin the Serjeant agen—there—we must use him once more —oh come, Sir. Enter Officer and Serjeant, and three or four Soldiers. Officer sings. Draw out our Foot, and flank the Horse, The Gates of that proud Building force: And bid the Churl his Money bring, Whose sordid Soul, as black as Ink, Would never make a Soldier drink; Nor do one generous thing. Serj. At your Command you may be sure, They instantly will do't, And if come Files of Foot, A Score of Men, or fewer, Were order'd here, where now we are, You'd find some Bags as full and fair, And buxom Girls to boot. Officers. This seems a Farmer's Grange. Serj. 'Tis so. Those Earthworms make the Money grow, As rife as Beans and Peas, And tho' himself look like a Louse, He has two Daughters in his House, That shine as bright As Stars by Night, And quick and nimble as a Mouse; Hop up and down like Fleas. Officer. Stand, stand away—sure these are they. Serj. Your Honour's Right—A Sorrel and a Bay. [Daughters come in. Another Movement, slow. 1 Daug. Be pleas'd, Sir, to draw near, And taste our homely Beer. We've Manchets just now bak'd, And Chesnuts newly rak'd; Stout Beer, the Bottles breaking, And Syder, our own making—Stout Beer, &amp;c. Officer. Oh! for your Meat and Drink I think not on't; There's something else, Sweetheart, I want. 2 Daug. Your Honour may love Fruit: We'll bring ye that to boot. A Peach that charms the Puller, And Cherries your own Colour; Fine Plums that might regale a Queen, With Codlings too and Cream. Officer. The prettiest Fools that e'er were seen By Heaven, or else I Dream. How my Heart pants—I must—and yet I'm loth. [Aside. Serj. A plague, why sure he won't attack 'em both. Officer. Sweet—can you love— 1 Daug. Oh! yes, Sir, and afford a Bargain in't with Honesty. Officer. A simple, simple word. 'Tis out, quite of Fashion [takes hold of the first, and t'other pulls him away] Come, I long. 2 Daug. Pray, Sir, mind me, I'll sing ye a fine Song. Another Movement. There was a Soldier brave intrenching, That Honour priz'd, not Gold, nor wenching, Was still the foremost, never flinching. Officer. Oh Transport! how this second Fires? Come, then, will you comply with my Desires? [To the second Daughter. I grow impatient. 1 Daug. Pray, Sir, turn this way, I sing a little too as one may say. [Takes hold of the second Daughter, and the first pulls him away. Another Movement. The Captain from the Temple led His kind and charming Love, And fairly got her Maidenhead, As she did well approve. Serj. They've fool'd him quite, I see it in his Face. Officer. Sweet Innocence, how charming is thy Grace! Lust now ebbs out, and Love flows in a-pace. Another Movement. 2 Daug. Remember Honour glorious, 'Twill make you still victorious; Which Peace of Mind providing, Is to Fame's Temple guiding. 1 Daug. If you would take occasion, To plant a lawful Passion. [Sings the same Tune. What Charmer but would take ye, And ever happy make ye. Officer. I will; my Heart, by Love and Honour won, So much admires thee now, I'll plight a nuptial Vow, And for your charming sakes will save the Town. Another. Draw off, my Boys, your Powers, Obey, and dare not frown, Great Honour will be yours, Serjeant. But Profit will be none. [Answering in the same Tune. Offic. and Women. Great Honour will be yours, By this brave Action done. Serj. and Soldiers. Great Profit would be ours, If we were let alone. Offic. and Women. Great Honour will be yours, Serj. and Women. Great Profit would be ours. Offic. and Women. Great Honour will be yours, By this brave Action done. Serj. and Soldiers. Great Profit would be ours, If we were let alone. Chorus of all. Great Honour, &amp;c. Bayes. Great Honour will be mine, whenever this is sung: Gentlemen and Ladies, very well done, egad—and so your most humble. [Exeunt Singers] Come, now a Dance of Dragoons and Milkmaids, and so conclude—[Dance here.] Look'e, I contriv'd this Song and Dance, to influence Virtue and Integrity amongst the Soldiers: And 'tis a sort of a mute Satyr, with instructive Hints, that instead of debauching the Country Lasses, as usual, they may reform and marry. Enter Fleabitten. Flea. Sir, There was a guilded Flask order'd me to act my part with, and Mrs.—has taken it for her own Use; so that without it I can't do my next poisoning Scene. Bayes. Odso, I must go and manage that Affair. [Exeunt. B. and Flea. Smith. Let's go too—There may be some pleasant Scuffle amongst the Women. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. Enter Bayes, and Gentlemen, as before. Bayes. Come, Gentlemen, now you shall have my t'other Walk, and so we'll conclude honourably; which Walk I must tell ye, before-hand, will cause some Alterations in your Tempers, for 'twill raise both Terrour and Pity, the two great Incidents of a good Tragedy. John. Neither in me, I'll give my word before-hand. Bayes. Oh! I'll venture it—Come, where's Mischief-plotter, where's Thimblessa?—The Flask of Poison I'm sure is order'd now. And Fleabitten—where's she now?— Oh here they are—pray speak. Enter Thimblessa and Fleabitten. Thimb. Like sullen Spider in his Web, that lies Watching how he may catch and poison Flies: So have I waited for this Interview. You told me, when we lately eas'd our Bosoms, Of a rare Drugg was given you by a Wizzard, That would outdo ev'n Hecate's Composition, To rid us from those Letts of hopeful Greatness, And long'd for Love—give—give it me with Speed, I long to be in Action. Bayes. Blank Verse, observe, by way of Variety; Flea. 'Tis forth coming—and of so mortal, and so fell a Nature, 'Twill seise on all the innate Intellects, As soon as taken down. Thimb. Oonz—let me have it. John. Oh rare Maudlin—Sure this Gentlewoman has taken another sort of Dose—by her swearing. Smith. She's in a plaguy Passion, you must suppose. Chant. Oh—Love and Ambition work in her like Aquafortis. Bayes. Passion—why the subtle Creature has found out now, that the two Queens, as well as Parthenope, are in Love with her Prince. Zoons, would not that make one Swear? besides, you know, she's but of poor Extraction, a Sempstress. Chant. Nay, then, she may swear as she pleases. John. Oh—like any drunken Carter in Thames-street. Thimb. Deliver me the hellish Cordial straight; I'll do the Deed; this is the Hand of Fate: Keep you the Secret close, we'll both be great. [Exeunt. Chant. Why these are two dreadful Creatures, indeed, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Hum—Why, Sir, it may be they are, and it may be they are not—Come, proceed. Enter Armorillis and Parthenope. Parth. Is Prettiman then false—Oh dismal Fate: Arm. Are all my Hopes to be a Queen, too late? [Bayes mimicks 'em. Parth. I'm sick and tortur'd with the horrid News. Arm. Ambition, Fever-like, my Life pursues. Parth. Oh, that a Cordial some kind God would give! Arm. A Crown's the only Cordial I would have. Bayes. Plaguy restless, damnably uneasy, at the Turn of State: Here comes the two Queens—they're fall'n very sick too. John. Of a Fever, Sir! Bayes. A Fever, Sir,—O Lord! O Lord! there he is agen—D'ye hear, Gentlemen, the Devil take him, he puzzles me so, I don't know what I do or say. Smith. Nay, prithee, Johnson, this is barbarous. Chant. At the end of a Play, too, when Business comes on thick. Bayes. No, let him go on, I shall have it again in spite of him. A Fever!—no, Sir, they are sick for fear of being beheaded; you may well think they're in some Danger.—Ha, ha, ha; poor Creature, he has quite forgot what's past.— Come, pray come in, Queens—and very sick, d'ye hear? Enter Queens. 1 Queen. No Comfort yet, oh! who will be so kind To ease my fearful Sickness of the Mind? As th'tim'rous Hare that in the open Grounds Close in her Form, hears the ill-boding Hounds, So every Word brings Fear, and Fear my Breast surrounds. Bayes. And Fear my Breast surrounds—in Verse again. Sad, but smooth as the downy plumage Swans do wear. [Repeating. John. Or Storm opposing Fur of Russian Bear. Bayes. Ay, what you will, Sir; what you will—go on. Smith., Chant. Ha, ha, ha. 2 Queen. Guilt's fulsom Diet do's my Stomach pall, And ah! to whom shall I for Succour call, That can with Cordial Skill my Pain asswage, And quell my Royal angry Husband's Rage? Bayes. Now mind. Enter Thimblessa with a Flask. Thim. They're here, and all, as to my Purpose, met Like Partridge-Covey, ready for the Net; [Aside. I come, great Queens, to pity your fall'n State. [To them. 1 Queen. What News abroad? 2 Queen. What says the Voice of Fate? Thim. The King do's still persist in Rage and Hate; Sharp Knives, and Axes, and such Butcher's Words, Are all the Matter their Discourse affords. 1 Queen. I may well believe we are undone. 2 Queen. There is, alas! no way for us but one. Bayes. No way for us but one. [Mimicking.] Hold, hold, now supposing her self in fear of Execution, and resolving to suffer mildly, here must be a topping Simile. Smith. Is that absolutely necessary, Sir? Bayes. Yes, Sir, 'tis always counted a mighty Ornament; a noted Bard lately, at the end of an Act, to embellish the Work, made his Heroine compare her self to a Bull just going to be knock'd o'th' Head.—Now mine here, I think, is a more soft and natural Fancy by much; for I compare my Queen, to shew her Humility, to a meek, lowly Country Cook-maid, who is just designing to stick a Pig. John. A Pig, that's lowly and condescending indeed. Bayes reads. Thus do's the tuneful Pig in Fotis's Arms. Smith. The tuneful Pig! Bayes. Ay, Sir, with Wick, Wick, Wick, deplore ensuing Harms; Mouth stop'd, and Limbs extended snowy white, Like tender Virgin on her Bridal Night; Yield to the Knife which thro' its Gullet goes, Whilst gushing Purple down the Bowl exuberantly flows. Ah, Gadzooks, match that Simile, Mr. Critick, if you can. Smith. Nay, Faith, Johnson, here I think Mr. Bayes has Nonplus'd ye. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Bayes. Nonplus'd 'em, ha, ha, ha.—Come, go on. Parth. But of the Princes what do's Fame relate? Thim. There's Gibbets rais'd for them at the Court Gate. Bayes. A bloody Character hers.—You must know, as these for Pity, so I made hers to cause Terror; besides, being all her Rivals, the subtle Queen tells this Lye, that so by driving 'em to Despair, she may make 'em readier for her Revenge. 1 Queen. What's to be done? 2 Queen. Since of all Hope bereft? Thim. Take Heart, oh Queens, some Comfort yet is left. [Shews the Flask. This happy Flask a Cordial Draught contains, Compos'd to ease th'afflicted of their Pains: Not Gallick Nantz, nor fam'd Hibernian Juice, Nor what the noble Clary do's produce, Can half so much revive.—Drink and don't spare, It is the sovereign Antidote of Care. [Gives it the 1s t Queen. 1 Queen. Thou'rt kind—I'll try—'tis good. [Drinks and gives it the 2d Queen. 2 Queen. None better found. [Drinks and gives it Arm. Arm. Most excellent. [Gives it Parthenope. Parth. Divine,—let it go round. [All drink. Bayes. If this is not a barbarous Devil, I don't know where you will find one.—This Scene too will make some People be afraid of being too eager for a Dram of the Bottle. Thim. So, now to your Repose with Pleasure go, [Exeunt all but Thimblessa. What Comforts will attend, you soon will know. 'Tis done to my Wish, and I shall fear none of these Rivals hereafter.—Now for my t'other Fool, Fleabitten; to stop her Tale-telling I'll go to the Kings and accuse her presently. The Flask they have with 'em, which being known to be hers, will do her Business effectually. [Exit. Chant. Oh! this Catastrophe will be too bloody, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. This, nay there's more yet.—The Princes are to take the same Dose too.—Come, quick, Prince Volcius; pray, Sir, come and poyson your self. Enter Princes. P. Vol. What have they done, ye Gods! what is't I see! P. Pret. Oh! dreadful Sight! dead my Parthenope! [They go in and bring out the Flask. 'Tis so, and done by this, of which I'm th'Cause. P. Vol. Since too, we've lost the Crown, why do we Pause? Let's follow strait to the Elisian Shade. P. Prett. Which was for all such wretched Lovers made. [They drink and Exeunt. Smith. Oh! horrible. Bayes. Nay prithee, dear Smith, have Patience. I know these tragick Actions must needs touch thee, as they will the rest of the Audience; but prithee let the Play conclude. I tell thee still thou hast not my Head.—Come, now draw the dead Scene there, and shew them all, and then enter the two Kings hastily. Scene draws, and the two Queens, Prince Volcius, Prince Prettiman, Armorillis and Parthenope, appear sitting in Chairs all a-row, as dead. So; now I'll be bold to say, this excels the most famous dead Scene that ever was shewn in Tragedy. Enter Kings, with Thimblessa and Fleabitten guarded. 1 King. Oh! baleful Sight; oh! wretched Royalty, That cannot this amend, and yet can see. 2 King. We were resolv'd Love shou'd again take place, And all be pardon'd by an Act of Grace. 1 King. Faithful Thimblessa, thy Preferment shall Equal thy Loyalty, which we extol. 2 King. But for this bloody Trait'ress—let her feel The sharpest Pangs on the tormenting Wheel. Flea. Barbarian! will you serve me thus? [To Thimblessa. Thim. Yes, Fool,— 'Tis just, I always us'd ye as my Tool: Like modern Wits that deal in Policy, Us'd for a Turn a while, and then thrown by: Lay hold, and bind her. [The Guards are going to bind her. Flea. Nay then, I'll play my Card. Kings—they are all alive, take off your Guard. Both Kings. Alive,—how can that be? Smith. Ay, how indeed? I'm sure we saw 'em poyson themselves fairly. John. Ay, and they must be dead too, what a Pox! Bayes. Oh! you shall see that presently.—D'ye hear, all of ye, are ye dead or no? Omnes. No, no. Bayes. Look'e there, I hope you'll take their Words. Chant. Well; but how is this natural, Mr. Bayes? Bayes. Why thus, Sir; I have told ye agen and agen, that the Audience, as well as your selves, shall always be surpriz'd with my Plots; so what you think will end one way, I ever design another: And this, Sir, I affirm, no Poet breathing has Wit enough to do but my self. Smith. Ay, but a little plainer, pray, Mr. Bayes. Bayes. Why then plainly, you must know, Sir, that this Fleabitten, a better Head-piece than t'other, and a great deal honester, finding the vicious and vindictive Nature of Thimblessa, resolv'd to try her by a piece of Cunning; and so told her she had that mortal Poyson, already mention'd, which she, wanting it to dispatch her Rivals, greedily begs, and t'other as readily seems to grant, but instead of it only gives her a Flask fill'd with Sack, with an Opiate in't, which in few Minutes would lose its quality, and render 'em as well as ever.—And now, pray, Sir, have you my Head or no?— Ha, ha, ha.—Go on, dear Fleabitten. Smith. This is better than I expected, Johnson. Flea. Within ten Minutes she my Guilt shall clear, and prove who did the Deed. Kings. Then seize on her. [Guards go to seize her, and she turns mad and raves Thim. Burn, burn my Chariot. Bayes. See, see another Turn, her Guilt has crack'd her Brain, and she runs mad o'th' sudden. Thim. Burn, burn my Chariot, I am Phaeton, I guide the flaming Horses of the Sun; Or rather, I'm his Spouse—Cynthia the Moon: The Stars are all my Pages, see how they glitter, Each in his Golden Coat made up of Atoms. Their Food Coffee-Berries scorch'd by Lightning, That burns the Souls of Monarchs into Crust; Mingling in melted Vows instead of Water. You Kings are my Gallants.—Come let's to bed; But you're so old—you cough, and snore, and spit. Royalty's rotten.—Give me sound Heart of Oak. [Looking on P. Prettiman. I shake your Leaves off. [Shakes 'em.] But there's a Pine, hah. Oh, ye Gods!—he's crooked, grow straight, for Shame; stand firmly like a Cedar—I heard him breathe, he plays Dogsleep to balk me.—If so, I'll dive and get a Lobster's Claw, alive I'll get one; and so pinch his Nose, I'll make him roar 'till he leave off dissembling.—Ha, ha, ha, ha, he's mounting, and Vapour like, see he's exhal'd on high:—I'll follow and pursue him through the Sky. Ride on a Whirlwind, make proud Jove obey: I come, I come, ye Clods of Earth, give way. [Rushes thro' the Guards, throws some down and Exit. Bayes. Oh! rarely acted, finely perform'd, egad, Mrs.— This, Gentlemen, is a Trick, you must know, often us'd by some very great Authors; who when they don't know what to do with a Character in their Plays, they make it, to amuse the Audience, run stark mad; which do's the Business rarely. —But now for their Majesties Act of Grace in Conclusion, and then all shall end merrily. John. So, that's well. 1 King. If Goddess Juno would my Spouse restore, I would forgive, and doat on her once more. 2 King. And I be fonder than I was before. 1 King. These Princes, tho' disloyal, pardon too, And in a friendly Dance new Joys pursue. Flea. Sound Musick there, see, they begin to wake. The Tune of a Dance is plaid, the first Queen yawns, rises slowly up, makes a Curtesy, and takes the first King, who smiling kisses it. 1 Queen. A Dance—nay then this Hand I humbly take. 2 Queen. I this, and hope I shall Atonement make. [Takes the second King's Hand. P. Vol. Then this is mine. [Takes Armorillis. Arm. This mine. P. Pret. This mine. [Takes Parthenope. Parth. This mine. Omnes. And all with Thanks in the Diversion join. Here they all Dance with hugging and kissing, inspir'd by Cupid and Venus descending from the Clouds. Bayes. Now here's the finest Dance in the World— There's for ye now, egad, I can't forbear saluting 'em my self in this Dance; and to make 'em finish the Play in Joy and Peace, is beyond all other Conclusions in the World, I think. John. Be the rest of the Play what it will, the Conclusion of it, by Jove, is good.—Hark'e, Friend, [To a Scene-keeper.] prithee try if thou can'st get me a Dram of something. Smith. I can't conclude sure 'till that Gentlewoman [Fleabitten] is rewarded. Chant. Ay, that indeed must be thought on, and then all's in order. Bayes. Why then she shall be rewarded, Sir, if you'll have Patience. The Queens, you see, are just going to complement her; look'e there, [The Queens go and make Curtesies, and Whisper Fleabitten.] she's happier than the Poet is, she's to have a considerable Place at Court. John. What, without being sent to learn Spanish? Bayes. Ay, Sir, without being sent to learn Spanish, good Mr. Biter; are you let into that Secret!—Well, thus far I think we are right.—Now for the last vocal Entertainment, and then you're welcome, Gentlemen. John. Egad, the Entertainment must stay for me, my Stomach wambles so, I must go and look after my Dram. Smith. Why Faith, I think a Dram, as he says, will be no false Latin, and then we'll come and hear the Conclusion. Bayes. Let 'em go, the Jest is coming to Discovery. [Exit Johnson and Smith] And now we are alone, my Friend, I give ye Thanks for your Share in't. Chant. I think I han't been wanting to humour Matters as you order'd me; and if your comical Action, lately rehears'd, has been a Bite upon our Criticks, Smith and Johnson yonder, but especially the last, I shall find my self very well diverted with the Pleasure of turning the Jest upon him; not only by shewing your superior Talent of Understanding, which he now very much doubts; but also by their finding the Drama here, which he has all along ridicul'd, to be essentially proper in its self, and writ on purpose in this manner for the Town's Diversion. Bayes. The ill Nature of Criticism is grown to so monstrous a Degree, and the Wits of that kind are so plung'd in their own Self-opinions, that for the mere sake of condemning a whole Piece, they shall negligently overlook several Beauties in it that deserve Applause; of this inveterate kind is Johnson, whom, by ridiculing my self in Action, I and my Piece here have banter'd all this while; and who, for all his boasted Learning and Judgment, do's not enter into the Merit of my Cause. Chant. There lies the Marrow of the Jest, I shall laugh at him egregiously when we bring him to own his Mistake; I have lent him the Book you gave me, your Remarks on human Learning. Bayes. I heard so, and that it has the Luck even to controul his Criticism, for they say he commends it to the Skies. Chant. He's ravisht with't, calls it, The Wonderful;— swears Aristotle and Pliny were mere Dunces to the Author of that, which makes our Design the more pleasant still. Bayes. Through all my Piece, hitherto, it has seem'd a Banter upon Poets and Poetry; now 'tis high time to let the Satyr turn upon the Criticks, and by proving the subject Matter only spurious, shew the Excellence of that charming Mystery, and curb the Rashness of those who suppose themselves Judges of Wit and Writings, and yet in reality come very short of the Matter: But here they are again,—now for the Musick, and then we shall hear the Sentence.—Come, Gentlemen. Enter Johnson and Smith. And now to entertain you, Sir, particularly, [To Johnson.] I have contriv'd another Opera Rarity. It has always been a great Beauty in 'em to get a Lyon, or a Bear in, to put one of the chief Actors in Distress; who being very outragious upon the poor Fellow that was cover'd in the Monster's Shape, and to shew his extreme Valour, has often beat and bruised him most unmercifully. Now to shew a little more Decency, and save the Scene-keeper, who generally had not above half a Crown a time for having his Bones broke, I have contriv'd something, for I confess I would have a Lyon if possible. Smith. Oh! nothing more natural in an Opera than a Lyon, Mr. Bayes. John. Ay, or the Creature that goes about with long Ears would do very well. Chant. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Bayes. Well, well, for all that, this is purposely presented to your Parts, Faith, Mr. Johnson. Now my Contrivance is this,—I bring my Hero, who must be a fine Singer, you must know, upon the Stage; the seeming Lyon attacks him;—but here's the Turn now—the Opposer is only a Scotch Conjurer, or Magician, who puts himself into a Lyon's Shape to destroy the Hero, who is one of King George's Officers, and was singing in a Wood near the Camp there; but hearing his melodious and delicate Trillo, is so charm'd, that after two or three Flourishes and slight Buffets receiv'd, he sings the Bass part in a Dialogue with him, and afterwards a Scotch Song; where giving him the Victory, he saves the Breath of the one, and the Bones of the other—Ha, ha, ha. Smith. Admirably well contriv'd, Sir. Bayes. Well, if you like it, Gentlemen, I'll crowd it somewhere amongst the rest. Come, enter Hero, his Sword drawn for the Combat, and let the Lyon be ready to answer and sing the Scotch Song. Enter Hero and Lyon. Hero sings in Recitative. Alas, alas, alas, what ails me, Methinks my Strength and Courage fails me; 'Tis so, and if Fate don't restore me, This horrid Monster may devour me: Yet I've a Musick Spell, a Sybil gave me, Is Sovereign, and perhaps may save me. Air. Oh! Musick that with moving Art, Inspires the Brain and charms the Heart, In gentle Numbers now infuse Such Strains to the harmonious Muse, As may with Joy to Mortals shew All they can prove Divine below. Lyon sings in Recitative. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I've lost all Power. Bayes. Egad, so methinks; is that like the roar of a Lyon, Sir? You should roar out, Oh, oh, as if you were to be heard all over the Forest.—Prithee, Jack what d'ye call'm, do't agen, for Shame. Lyon. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I've lost all Power, My Charm's out-done, and at this Hour I cannot leap, nor lash, nor roar. Hero. What art thou, in the name of Wonder, With Lyon Shape, and Voice of Thunder? Some grand Inchanter's Fiend, or what; A Beast, a Devil, or a Scot? Lyon. Hear but my Air All will appear. Sings a Scotch Song. I. Ise a Highland Laddy, Muckle, stout and bold, As e'er wore a Pladdy Wrapping from the Cold. A rank Union hater, Which did us nea Gud, And to root that Matter, Woons Ise lease my Blood. II. Daddy dealt in Charming, We'll he'd cure the Itch; Weather too make storming, Mammy was a Witch: Fra these twa gud People Came my Conj'ring Skill; I can fire a Steeple, Or can raise the De'el. III. Oft my sel transforming to smaw Beast or large, I abroad am harming, Aw that love King George. But your Charm is stronger By a high Degree, I can roar no longer, You have conquer'd me. Hero in Recitative. Victoria, Victoria; vive le Roy, vive le Roy; Victoria. Since Fate alone this Deed has done, I must Affairs to Orders bring; And wish the King's vile Enemies, That ever dare against him rise All ty'd in such a String. [Fetches a Cord and puts about the Lyon's Neck. Air. Just as my Musick conquer'd thee, So will the King each Enemy, 'Twill be but vain opposing: Ye ragged Loons that won't obey, And have in Hopes a smiling Day, 'Ware, 'ware the fatal closing. [Leads out the Lyon by the Halter. Bayes. So, so; why there's the Lyon conquer'd now, and the Ladies not frighted at all with a bloody Battle. The rest of the Entertainment, Gentlemen, are three several sorts of Humourists that make their Court to a Lady; who is so modest she receives all with Indifference. The first is an honest jolly Country Gentleman, that she refuses for Toping, and who resolves not to leave his Bottle for any Beauty in Christendom. Enter Gentlemen. SONG here. I. When I visit proud Celia just come from my Glass, She tells me I'm fluster'd, and look like an Ass; When I mean of my Passion to put her in mind, She bids me leave drinking, or she'll ne'er be kind. That she's charmingly handsome, I very well know, And so is my Bottle, each Brimmer so too; And to leave my Soul's Joy, oh, 'tis Nonsense to ask, Let her go to the Devil, to the Devil, bring t'other half Flask. II. Had she tax'd me with Gaming, and bad me forbear, 'Tis a thousand to one I had lent her an Ear. Had she found out my Cloris, up three pair of Stairs, I had balk'd her, and gone to St. James's to Prayers. Had she bad me read Homilies three times a Day, She perhaps had been humour'd, with little to say. But at Night to deny me my Flask of dear Red, Let her go to the Devil, to the Devil, there's no more to be said. Smith. Ha, ha, ha,—This is a very jolly Fellow indeed. Bayes. Well, now, Gentlemen, you shall see the Lady and her most favour'd Gallant, who is a little upon the Grumble—You shall hear. Come, Courtier like, a fine Air now. Enter well Drest Gentleman and Lady. He sings. I. 'Tis not a Kiss, or gentle Squeeze, A Complement or smiling Eye, That can my anxious Bosom ease, Or quell the Flame that soars so high. Each welcome Favour giving Hope, Dear Celia rais'd my Joys at first; But stinted is but like a Drop, That's giv'n to one who dies with Thirst. II. Fool'd Tantalus in Days of old, Had greatest Torment for his Sin, Forbid to taste, yet still behold; The Fruit was bobbing at his Chin. Such luscious Plums and Grapes I view, Whilst all by me are highly priz'd, Can you a Guest invited too, Think fit should be so tantaliz'd? III. Who lets his Friend but only sip His Wine, is Niggard of his Store, So tho' I taste your rosie Lip, 'Tis nothing if you grant no more. With Fragments some the Stomach please, And small Repast the Humour fits, But Love's a Lord of noble Race, And cannot dine on Scraps and Bits. Bayes. Well said, you see he deals like a Man of Honour, he tells her his Mind—But now you shall hear what the Lady says. Smith. Ay that, pray, Sir. Lady sings. I. When your Passion, On small Occasion, Or Inclination, Your Humour fires; Straight 'twill cause ye, To grow more sawcy, If e'er we cross ye, In vain Desires. But we are not Such Fools, we dare not, And therefore fear not, Your Tricks to tell: Let it grieve ye, We must deceive ye, An Inch to give ye, You'll take an Ell. II. If our Favours, Of Kindness savours, Your warm Behaviours Soon shews ye rude: If but civil, It works our Evil, For like the Devil, We're still pursued. Or if lending A part pretending, 'Twill soon be ending, In Friendship small: You're such Creatures, Such Virgin Haters, 'Tis in your Natures, To plunder all. Bayes. There, there; ha, ha, ha, I think she has given him his own agen—with Interest, egad. Chant. She's even with him—indeed, Sir, that must be owned. John. Ay, very well, so this is the last, is it? Bayes. No, Sir, not yet—The Lady is not so ill belov'd— but there's a mad Fool that follows her, amongst the rest,—And now prepare your selves—for I intend to shew the very Quintiscence of Humour that can be in Song— Come, dear, dear, Mr. a—Enter, and as mad as a March Hare, be sure. Enter Madman. Sings. From deep Avernus, which some call the Grave, Blasted with Care and Pain, By scornful Beauty slain, O'er Lethe's Flood, and many a horrid Wave, I now ascend to Plains of Light again. I'll mount where the Celestial Signs Are all in lofty Skies appearing, Where Musick every Sphere refines, And makes it worth Apollo's hearing. Can be my dear; I've rang'd, I've sought her, far and near! My Flames can tell, She's not in Hell, And too Divine, On Earth to shine: No, no, 'tis so, she must be there. And see where Berenice is frowning, Her brown dishevel'd Locks disowning; When she displays her Silver Hair, And whilst her Brow's divinely fair, Bright Ariadne too is crowning, She sits in State, in Casiopea's Chair. Oh, help, ye Powers, that Lovers sway, Help, help, some lovesick God; Her lovely Bosom shews the milky way, And we can never, never miss the Road. The Giants of old, Made with Deities bold, Set Hills upon Hills, By their Force and their Skills: My Zeal is as strong, And I'll do so e'er long, On high Penmen-mawr, Raise like Babel a Tower. But if human Art, cannot add to my Force, I'll fly like a Dove, by a far better Course; For my Friends the mad Muses will lend me their Horse. But if, &amp;c. Bayes. Ah, mighty, mighty,—well, my dear Friend, go, go, prithee make hast in, and get one of the young Girls to rub ye down, for thou art in a plaguy Sweat, I find; go, go. Well, Gentlemen, what say ye, is not this conclusion fine? [Exit Madman. Chant. Very entertaining, certainly, Mr. Bayes. Smith. Ay, ay,—the Songs are all, no doubt on't, very well. Bayes. And now, pray, Sir, your Judgment of the whole candidly. John. Why, Sir, as to the Musical part, I have little to carp at; but if you ask my Opinion candidly of the whole, I must be so free to tell ye,—that you design some Scenes here for serious Tragedy, that are strange stuff to me. Smith. There wants, indeed, a little Elevation, Mr. Bayes, Ha, ha, ha. Bayes. Bite: Ha, ha, ha, faith, you shall give me leave now, Sir, to laugh in my turn; Ha, ha, ha, ha. Chant. And I too, faith,—Ha, ha, ha, ha,—for with your Severity's Leave, my Friend Critick, he can shew very sound Reasons for what is past: And I have been all along concern'd in the Secret, to put the Trick upon ye, and brought ye hither this Morning for that Design. In short, the piece was writ thus humourously on purpose; and what you suppos'd intended serious Tragedy was done in ridicule to banter the Criticks; so faith Johnson your censorious Sword has had no edge to wound any thing here, if you consider wisely of the matter. John. Nay, if 'tis really so, I confess Smith and I are both banter'd; but however, I can't help saying, a Poet for this sort of writing cannot be preferr'd by me; if he could come up to such a thing as this now [pulls out a Book] Remarks on human Learning, if he could write such a Book instead of Criticising, I should adore him. Chant. Why then to confound that inveterate Humour of thine, all at once know, that this individual Person is the very worthy Author of that Book you value so, and now I hope you will knock under. John. Why art thou in earnest—Did you write this Book, Sir?— Bayes. If it could speak, Sir, I believe it would answer in the affirmative. John. Why then, Sir, with much Veneration, and more Shame, for my Mistake of you and your Writings, I humbeg your Pardon; and for your sake resolve hereafter to judge of Authors, and each particular Genius, with more Candor than formerly. And, Sir, to make some amends, I do also confess, that there is a natural Self-Conceit, in most that would be thought Criticks, that infinitely sway above their Design of doing Justice, which has made me disallow several sprightly Thoughts and Fancies, especially in your vocal Part: To conclude, I am now of another Opinion, and shall be proud of your instructive Conversation. Smith. And I, Sir; you having now ingeniously taught us to acknowledge that we have been severe upon our selves, not you all this while, and only begging your comical Epilogue, which you gave us a hint of, we desire to begin a strict Obligation of Friendship over a Bottle. Bayes. With all my Heart, Gentlemen. Chant. Then, Johnson, you can't help confessing the Musical Part here is well enough? John. Yes, for English, but I could not help thinking it was not elevate, like the Italian Artists: Oh! one Seraphick Trillo of the Signiors. I like th'insipid Town Thought beyond— Chant. Beyond all the good Sense in the World, Hah! Bayes. Now, Gentlemen, you must know, that this Epilogue has a Whim in't, as well as the Prologue, it is a Trialogue, and to be perform'd between Sol, Rain, and Boreas. Smith. Oh! for Heaven's sake let's have it. Bayes. On Condition that you will henceforth be reconcil'd to Plays and Stage-Poetry, you shall—always considering the Design is for specular Instruction, as I could shew you in a Piece of my own; but since that looks like Vanity, I will borrow a Piece of a Country Friend of my Acquaintance, and conclude with a Parallel. A Country Lass, for such was she here, (In th'City may be Sluts as well as there) Kept clean her Hands, for those being always seen, Had told her else how sluttish she had been. But for her Face, 'twas dirty as the Stall Of a Fishmonger, or a Usurer's Hall. Begrim'd with Filth, that you might boldly say She was a true Piece of Promotheus's Clay. At last within a Pail, for Country Lasses Have oftentimes no other Looking-glasses, She saw her dirty Face, and fain she would Have blush'd, if thro' so much Dirt she could: Yet straight within that Water—that I say, That shew'd the Dirt—she wash'd the Dirt away: So, Comedy, as Poets do intend 'em, Serve first to shew your Faults, and then to mend 'em. The End of the Musical Opera.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The EPILOGUE Spoken by Actors brought in by Bayes. The Epilogue is a Trialogue, and spoken by three Figures, in Poetical Dresses; the one Representing the Sun, the second Pluvia, or Rain, and the third Boreas, or the North Wind; who now, as in a fit of Raillery, expose worldly Humours, and mimick a subtle Money-Game, or Trick, play'd in City Management; where People of all Degrees, who expected the Benefit of wonderful Rise of Stock, are disappointed. The Comical Names they now take, are Mississippi, Directius, and Bubble. Mississippi begins. Mississ. I like the Sun, Bright Beams put on; And with Scotch Sense, Got golden Pence From forward Fools that would believe me. I spread my Rays, Dazled their Eyes, And tho' some gaz'd To hear my Lyes, I did the Rich and Poor surprize, And no Plot-Juggler rose to grieve me. Direct. Near the Exchange, where Traders gain, I fluently began to rain, And making full round Drops appear, Sprinkled both Whig and Tory there, I would not let Scotch Wit out-do me. The Men at Court, tho' proud and great, Were bubbled by my Money Cheat; The grave Law-makers too with Pain Went dangling in my growing Rain, I made 'em think they all should gain Vast Heaps if they'd pursue me. Bubble. To make this City Chouce to grow, And trick the Globe, as Time did shew; I, like North Gust, did slily blow; Sword Blades and Copper I'd maintain I mingled with the Sun and Rain, And strove by Law to make things plain; York-Buildings, Fishing, many a Bubble I manag'd well, and gain'd each Day, without much Pain or Trouble. Mississ. But oh! the Drowth of sultry Days. Direct. But oh! the Floods when Rain essays. Bubble. But oh! the Blasts when Boreas sways. Mississ. I with my Radiance lull'd the P?s, I Dissipated all their Fears; Made French Crowns pass, tho' wanting Weight, Made Plots t'involve the K?g and State, And grew my self confounded great. Direct. I found ye soon, Ye bonny Loon, And knew our Change Fools were in Tune; To manage Matters in your way, If Money Cheats could come in play, I therefore study'd the S? Sea: Brought Fops in first for three Pound ten, That did not dare to pass for Men; Soon after ten Pound, or a Score, Which doubled Weekly as much more; 'Till the Increase did so command, I drain'd up all the Money in the Land. This by my Showers and Rain was done, Which gain'd me still a vast Renown. Bubble. When Sun did glare, and Rain did flow, Then backward I began to blow; The Coffee-houses cram'd were seen, With Bubbles of all Sorts brought in; So great was still, so mighty then their Avarice and Folly. The common Ideots slighted were, The Brokers were employ'd so far, The Garter and the blazing Star Made posting haste to crowd Change-Alley. Mississ. But late with spreading such warm Beams, And getting Gold by vile Extremes; Tho' I regal'd the Regency, And made the K? as blind as he; Some Rabble would explode the Case To know what Mississippi was, And whether having paid their Money, That five Years hence they should have any. This cursed boggle broke my State, 'Twas first call'd Trick, and then a Cheat; The Mob began to gather Stones, And I to save my harrass'd Bones, Finding the Persecution hard, Got leave at Court to have a Guard; And in the Palace shone once more, But not so dazzling as before. Direct. You've now, dear Father of the Skies, Related my Calamities; For as your Mississippi's gone, So S? Sea Stock no more comes on: I wisely flow'd, and gently rain'd, Nine hundred once my Mart maintain'd; But when a Thousand I would force The Gray Mare prov'd the better Horse: The Money-trick no more would do, And down it fell to one or two, And made more busy Ideots mad Than ever Moor-Fields Bedlam had. You say at Court your State you hide, I there must too my Person guide; Lest some in pieces hew my Pate Whom I have chous'd of an Estate; Some Bubbles great turn'd out of Doors, That in our Stock, have spent their Stores, Have all resolv'd to launch my Pores. Five Millions have been dipt, they cry, Tho' some o'th' Wise say that's a Lye; For seven there scarce is in the Nation, So that's th'effect of Reprobation: But when the S?te sits, if those That bear my Title are prov'd Foes, And for nought had, if they should take The Humour to call Bullion back, Best way to save our being undone Is to consider where to run; For the Stock's heat is now so cool, Who scap'd is Wise, who's dipt a ? Bubble. I'm glad, by Heaven, since 'tis so, That we were snubb'd so long ago; My Breezings now can't please a Friend, I fizzle such small puffs of Wind: I cannot bring my Tricks to pass, Of Chalk, or Horn, or crimson Glass; Our modern Plots are open laid, We've chous'd the P?s, and ruin'd Trade. Search all the Cheats of foreign Nations That have been prone to cause Vexations, If ever one was so notorious, I'll give ye leave to hang up Boreas; So I'll sneak off this very Hour Before the C?s shew the Power. Mississ. Sol too, no more shall dazzle gay, Nor shine the Mississippi way; I'll make no Wheedles pass for Beams, Nor scorch the Grandees of St. James; Nor shew my Effigies with grace, As, Brother, yours at Guilford was. Direct. 'Tis true, with vile Subscriptions ty'd My Shape was late there dignify'd, And, on my Soul, had I my Due, And Cullies would Revenge pursue, My Corps would be suspended too: Therefore, dear Friends, away I'll go, In some Land foreign rain and flow, I've Heaps of Gold—got you know how. Bubble. The K?g's expected every Day, But I'll not for a Pardon stay, For I've deserv'd as much as they; And tho' we qualify'd our Case, They know our Cheat's too rank to pass, And for our Rout an Order was. Mississ. And now to th'Mississippi Sphere, I'll post to France, no more shine here, Lest Wilson's dreadful Ghost appear. Bubble. Since bubble Trifles sink so low My Blasts shall here no longer blow: Direct. Nor shall my fruitful Showers of Rain Change-Alley cheer, my Case is plain; The S?te sits, my Tribe must run, And here the Trialogue is done 'Twixt Pluvia, Boreas, and the Sun.</field>
