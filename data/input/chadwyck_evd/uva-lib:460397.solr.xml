      <field name="fulltext">Rectius Iliacum Carmen deducis in actus, Quam si proferres ignota indictaque prius. Horat. Art. Poet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HER Grace the Dutchess OF MARLBOROUGH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVERTISEMENT. The following Tragedy was Originally Written in French by the celebrated Monsieur Racine, whose Master-Piece it is justly accounted; and having been translated into English, with considerable Additions, by Mr. Boyer, and pass'd the Correction and Approbation of the late famous Mr. Dryden, and several other Persons distinguish'd as well by their Wit and Learning, as by their Taste and Discernment, was acted with general Applause, towards the End of the Year 1699, and Beginning of 1700. The Reasons why this Excellent Play stopt, on a sudden, in a full Career, are, in some Measure, accounted for in Mr. Boyer's Preface: To which he might have added, That the Dutchess of Marlborough, who at that Time bore an irresistible Sway, bespoke the Comedy then in Vogue, during the Run of Iphigenia in Aulis; And that this Tragedy receiv'd no small Prejudice, from the Person that acted Eriphile, who sunk under the Weight of so great a Part. This Tragedy having lain dormant for many Years, was lately revived, in the most Irregular Manner, that was ever known or practised either on Parnassus, by Poets; or on the Stage, by Actors. The Town has already done Mr. Boyer some Justice, by Discovering the Imposition, and by Finding out, that the VICTIM was no other than Achilles and Iphigenia in Aulis. The Publishing a Second Edition of this Play, (which was out of Print) is sufficient to justify the Judgment of the Publick, and vindicate Mr. Boyer's Right. But the manner in which his Performance, and Himself, have been abused is so flagrant and injurious, that he designs, in few Days, to publish a short Dissertation, on the Present Management of the Stage, Addressed to My Lord Chamberlain, wherein he shall set in a true Light, the Pernicious Consequences of such Unfair Practises both of some Writers and Players; and in particular, inquire into the Reason, Why Mr. Wilks declined to revive, this very Tragedy, for the Entertainment of the Duke D'Aumont, who, by his Secretary Monsieur l' Abbe Nadal, had Intimated to Mr. Boyer, his Desire to see it represented; which Mr. Boyer signified to Mr. Wilks?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE PLAGIARY OF Mr. BOYER's IPHIGENIA. Vain is Racine's and Boyer's Labouring Wit! The one Improving what the other Writ: Both fall a Sacrifice to thy Third-Day And Lovely Iphigenia is thy Prey. Nor knows the Nimph if she should more detest Calchas or Thee; the Pirate or the Priest? Her ancient Tears and Griefs, from him proceed Who brought Her to Diana's Shrine to bleed: But that She Mourns unpitied in her Woes, The Wretched Virgin to thy Dulness owes. Her Life alone was Wicked Calchas's Aim: Thou touchest a yet tenderer Part, her Fame. Thy Theft has all her Grace and Lustre soil'd; Thou Stolest the Beauty first, and after spoil'd. So fares it with that desperate Band, who live On Prey and Rapine, and by Injury thrive. Those whom they Wrong, with Hatred they pursue, And not content to Rob, they Murder too.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE DEDICATION TO The Beautiful and Ingenious DIANA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PREFACE. Poets, like most Lovers, are apt to boast the Favours, or complain of the Rigour of their Mistress, the Town: For my part, I am too discreet a Lover to boast, and too young a Poet to complain; and tho' the First run of this Play was but short, yet I must own my self oblig'd to the Civility of the English Nation; for on this Occasion, as on many others, I found that the Imputation of being inhospitable and rude to Strangers, which Horace charges on the Britons, reaches no higher than the Mob. Some of my Friends wonder'd that a Play which was acted with so much Applause, should stop so soon in its career. The Reason of it is obvious: This Tragedy came out upon the Neck of another of the same Name, which being the product of a Giant-Wit, and a Giant-Critick, like Horace's Mountain in Labour, had miserably balk'd the World's Expectation; and most People having been tir'd at Lincolns-Inn-Fields, did not care to venture their Patience at Drury-lane, upon a false Supposition that the two Iphigenia's were much alike: Whereas they differ no less than a young, airy Virgin, from a stale, antiquated Maid. Another difficulty this Play labour'd under, was its being acted at a time when the whole Town was so much, and so justly diverted by the Trip to the Jubilee. A merry Entertainment is certainly very improper to prepare the Tastes of an Audience to relish a grave and solemn Tragedy; for we are naturally angry with those who would make us Weep, when we are in a fit of Laughing. Yet notwithstanding all these Inconveniencies, my Iphigenia has pleas'd the fairest Part of the Town, I mean the Ladies, and having gain'd this Point, I have my Wishes. Now when I call this Play mine, let me not be thought so arrogant as to assume the Honour of the Composition wholly to my self. The Subject of it is taken from a Greek Tragedy of Euripides: This Monsieur Racine brought upon the French Stage with the Addition of the Episode of Eriphile, Achilles's Captive, which renders his Plot more full and compleat. Monsieur Racine manag'd his Subjest with a great deal of Mastery: His Expressions are free and lofty; his Sentiments noble and virtuous; his Passions moving and natural; his turns well manag'd and surprizing; the whole Piece regular. The success answer'd his extraordinary Performance; Iphigenia at her first Appearance on the French Stage, drew Tears, and commanded Admiration both from the Court and the City, for many Months successively; and set Monsieur Racine above the Level of all French Tragick Writers. The great success of Racine's Iphigenia, and the Encouragement I receiv'd from some Persons of a just Discernment, made me venture to make her appear upon an English Theatre; now, whether she has gain'd or lost any Thing by her new Dress, I leave to the Judicious to determine. All I can say in her Favour, is, That her numbers are easy and flowing; and that she speaks English like a genteel well-bred Lady, and not like an affected, pedantick Would-be-Wit. But in this I must own my self oblig'd to my honour'd and ingenious Friend Mr. Cheek, to whom I owe some of my smoothest Lines. I wish he had a greater share in the whole Play, for then I am sure the Town would have lik'd it a great deal better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE. Written by Tho. Cheek, Esq; Spoken by Mr. Powell. Apollo t'other Day in Council sat, Where after many a learned and wise Debate, Finding Wits Enemies so fast encrease, To Silence noisy Fools, and keep the Peace, It was Resolv'dâAs well the Cause it fits, To Reinforce his Regiment of Wits, Among the rest, the Author of this Play Here takes his Post, and enters into Pay. He hopes to keep it too with Reputation, And stem the Tide of Folly in the Nation. That's a hard Taskâ, and I'm afraid it tends To make him lose abundance of his Friends: Yet tho' he has obtain'd a Priviledge, He would be very loath to Disoblige. The Race of Fops his Satyr ne're will drive at, If modestly they'll play the Fool in private. But if they still appear in publick Places, With fashionable Nonsense and Grimaces, He must not let 'em scape without Derision, That were a Crime would forfeit his Commission. Yet in this Play no Satyr will appear. All that deserve it are in safety here. From great Euripides he drew this Piece, Euripides the boast of ancient Greece. And wondrous Beauties of each coming Scene, With Pride he owns he borrow'd from Racine. Then, since these Poets had such great Success. Why mayn't ours please you in an English dress? Yet tho' like them the labour'd Scene he draws, With just regard to the Dramatick Laws, He'd not be thought of that vain-glorious Tribe, Who their own Rules imperiously prescribe. He better knows what to your Taste is due, And writes well, only when he pleases you. His Muse in Nature's Majesty appears, She has no Sounds Tremendous to the Ears; And if once more he should attempt to write, His Pen shall Draw, your Palate shall Indite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. Motteux. Spoken by Mr. Norris. The Deuce take Poet, Epilogue, and Play! The Devil a Word know I what I've to say, Who'll mind his Cant? An Audience, like a Lover, Longs to be gone soon as the Play is over, As for Exampleâ. Yond' mobb'd-up, civil, modest Velvet Faces Long to be Coach'd to more diverting Places. Not one would stay, tho' they but now sneak'd in; When our Play ends, theirs always does begin. Kind Cull, and Miss steal out from th'Epilogue, And merrier Scenes are acted at the Dog. You rakish Sparks in quest of Game run out, And give or take the Covent-garden Gout. Your Student who but came to see the Play, With some Pit-Muse his Talent would essay. Some at Basset long to encrease their Guineas, And leave 'em there, and then sneak home like Ninnies. You Topers long to drink in ample Glasses Confusion to dull Poets and pale Faces. But above all yond' City Fry would go, Who came by Three to sit on that First Row. Poor Things! They thought e're this that they might home have scutled, Their Time's all spent, and all their Apples guttled. The Poet (if he's not quite Dead for Fear) Wou'd go to Wills Incog. t'observe his Criticks there. Scarce one wou'd stay but that obliging Fry, Who about this time in our dark Passage ply, Stale Wenches, Sharpers, Catterwawling Sparks, Old dirty Beaux, and young Attornies Clerks. Since then your Business lyes another way, I hope you have not Time to damn the Play; But if you must, do't on the Poets Day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Camp near the Sea Shore. A Fleet at a distance. The Curtain rises and discovers Agamemnon with a Letter in his Hand. Agam. Arcas, what hoa! Arcas, awake! He hears me not: Sweet Sleep seals fast his Eyes. He is no King, he is no wretched Father, Who fatally has promis'd his own Child, To be a bloody Victim to Ambition. Oh! Agamemnon! Thou hast banish'd Rest For ever, ever banish'd Peace of Mind, To grasp the shadow of a mighty Name. Arcas! I say, what hoa! Arcas. Enter Arcas. Arc. Great Sir, I comeâ. But what concern Has rouz'd you from your Bed before the Morn? There's scarce a glimmering Light to guide our Steps; All Eyes but yours and mine are clos'd in Aulis What! Has some welcome noise disturb'd the Air? And are the Winds propitious to our Wishes? But, noâAll sleeps: The Camp, the Winds, and Neptune. Agam. Oh Happy! Who contented with his State, Free from the Gaudy Thraldom of a Crown Securely lives in an obscure Retreat! Arc. What makes you thus expostulate with Fate? And hate those Honours, which indulgent Heaven With lavish Bounty has bestow'd on you? A Crown is the least blessing you enjoy. Your Queen and Children both proclaim you Happy; Descended on each side from mighty Jove, Hymen unites you still to all the Gods. Nay, moreâ, That noble Youth markt out by Fate, To do those Actions that will pass belief, Achilles courts your Daughter, and intends To light the Nuptial Torch on flaming Troy. What Triumph, Sir, is like that pompous shew Which Fortune here displays to raise your Glory? A thousand Sail, fraighted with twenty Kings, Wait only for a Gale, and your Command, 'Tis true this tedious Calm retards your Conquests; The fetter'd Winds obstruct your way to Troy; But then consider, e'en amidst these Honours, That as you are a Man you must expect To find the Sweets of Life still mixt with Gall; And as all things submit to Change, we mayâ But, Sir, what means this Letter, and your Tears? Is young Orestes ill? Is Clytemnestra or Iphigenia Sick? Agam. No, no, thou shalt not die, I'll ne're consent. [Aside. Arc. My Lord! Agam. Thou seest my trouble, but now learn the Cause, And judge if with my Cares I can repose. Thou well remember'st that long-wish'd-for Day, When all this numerous Fleet met here in Aulis, [Pointing to the Navy. And courted by the Wind to cut the Main, Had hoisted up her Sails: The shouting Host Began to threaten Troy's far-distant Shore. But on a sudden a new Prodigy Quell'd all our Raptures, and becalm'd the Sea; Our Ships deserted by the flattering Winds, Strove, but in vain to ply their feeble Oars. Surpriz'd, and fall of wonder, I addrest My Prayers to the fam'd Goddess of this Place, And then with Menelaus, Nestor, and Ulysses, I vow'd to her a secret Sacrifice. But, Oh! What dreadful Answer did I hear, When Calchas spoke aloud these fatal Words. âIn vain you arm against the Trojan State, âUnless a Daughter of the Race of Hellen, âUpon the Altar of Diana dies; âIf you'd obtain the Winds the Heavens deny, âSacrifice Iphigeniaâ Arc. Your Daughter! Agam. Amaz'd and Speechless for a while I stood: My trembling Spirits chill'd within my Veins: But when my broken Voice burst out a Passage, I curst the Gods and vow'd to disobey. My first resolve was to dismiss the Army, Which sly Ulysses seemingly approv'd, To let my raging Passion take its course. But soon employing his perswading Arts, He laid before me all the ties of Honour; Those Troops and Princes under my Command, The Eastern Empire fated to be ours, All that could raise Ambition to a height. I own that Title of the King of Kings, Flatter'd the haughty weakness of my Soul. Besides, the Gods assoon as gloomy Night, Began to lull my Cares in gentle Slumbers, With angry Dreams reproach'd my impious Pity, And threatn'd vengeance to my troubled Mind; With Tears I yielded and pronounc'd the Doom Of my unhappy Daughterâ. But now, what barbarous cunning did I use, To draw her from her Mothers tender Armes! I sent her Orders to repair to Aulis: Pretending that Achilles prest to go, Would wed my Daughter, e're we put to Sea. Arc. But fear you not Achilles's boiling Rage? Think you that unconcern'd he'll calmly see, His Name abus'd to Sacrifice his Love? Agam. Achilles then had left the Camp: To meet His Father Peleus insulting Foes; And all expected this new kindled War, Would for a while employ his early Courage. But what can stop this Heroes rapid course? Achilles Fights and Triumphs as he runs, And vying with the swiftest Wings of Fame, Return'd last Night to join our wondring Army. Arc. And has he learn'd what Fate attends his Bride? Agam. He has notâ. But still a stronger motive holds my Arm: My Daughter who with eager joy approaches, To meet a longing Lover and a Father, (The kindest Father as She may suppose) My Daughter meets inevitable Death. My Daughter! at that sacred Name I shake; Yet, 'tis not Blood alone endears her to me, Her Love, her Piety, her gentle Nature, A thousand blooming Virtues I regret. No, no, I'll ne're perform the Sacrifice, Heaven is too just to own so black a Deed, And to be Pious I must disobey. Arc. But how can you recal your solemn Promise? Agam. Thy Zeal and Prudence must perform that Task: I know, the Queen at Sparta try'd thy Faith; Here take this Letter and convey it to her. Prevent my Daughters coming: For when once She's seen in Aulis, her Fate's past recal. The Gods and Chalchas will demand their Victim, Controul my Tenderness and slight our Tears; Th'affrighted Grecians, jealous of my Power, With holy Boldness will protect their claim, Insult my woe; perhaps quash my Command. Go, Save her from the Gods, from my Ambition. But have a care not to reveal my secret; Let not my Daughter know what ill I meant her. Spare me the loud Reproaches of a Wife; Spare me the soft Upbraidings of a Daughter; And that thy Tongue may sute with what I write, Tell them Achilles having chang'd his Mind, Defers the Nuptial Rites till we return; That young Eriphile, his Lesbian Captive, Who now attends my Daughter, is suppos'd To be the cause of his indifference. Let them Divine the restâ. Approaching Day Bids thee to be gone: Depart. But who comes here? [Exit. Arcas. Gods! 'Tis Achilles: What! Ulysses with him? [A flourish of Trumpets. Enter Achilles, Ulysses. Agam. My Lord, I see with pleasing Admiration, Your swift return with Victory and Fame; If these are the Essays of untaught Valour, What Triumphs must attend your riper Courage? Lesbos subdu'd, all Thessaly reduc'd, Which seem'd to ask a Hero's tedious Toil, Prov'd only an Amusement to Achilles. Achil. My Lord, you over-rate a trifling Conquest: And may the Gods open a nobler Field, To merit the great Prize you have propos'd, To animate my Courage. But, My Lord, Must I believe the joyful News I hear? That to anticipate my distant Bliss, Fair Iphigenia comes to the Camp, To Crown my Wishes? Agam. My Daughter! Who told you she's to come? Achil. You seem surpriz'd, my Lord, at this Report? Agam. Heav'n! How I fear my secret is reveal'd [To Ulysses. And all my cunning lost! Ulys. My Lord, the King's surprize [To Achilles. Is but to just: Good Gods! Is this a time To think on Nuptial Joys, when angry Heaven Strikes terror through the Camp? Whilst a dead Sea Affrights all Greece, and wastes our lingring Army; Whilst to appease the unrelenting Gods, A Victim, a dear Victim must be Sacrific'd, Achilles minds his Love, as if he meant T'insult the publick Woes; must Agamemnon Exasperate our Fate with Festivals? Is this, my Lord, the tender Love you shew, To your afflicted Country? Achil. In Phrygian Fields our Actions soon will prove Whether Ulysses or I love her most. In the mean time, you may display your Zeal; You may securely tire the Gods with Prayers, And load their Altars with tame Offerings; You may consult the panting Victims Breast, And search the cause of the Winds tedious Silence, But as for me, who leave that care to Calchas, I hope, my Lord, I may pursue a Marriage, Which, nor concerns the Gods nor youâ. Yet, think not I'll dissolve in womanish Pleasures, No, if I love, 'tis like the God of War, Only to fill the vacancies of Action; And my couragious Soul could never brook, That any one should touch the Phrygian Shore Before Achillesâ Agam. Oh! Heaven! Why must thy secret Envy stop The way to Asia, to such noble Heroes? Must I be witness of so bright a Valour, Only to withdraw home, with Grief and Shame? Ulys. Ye Gods! What do I hear? Achil. My Lord, What's that you utter'd? Agam. Princes, we must retire: Too long the Winds Have tir'd our credulous Hopes with Expectation: Th'inexorable Gods are stubborn in denying; Troy's under their protection, and dire Omens Forbid we should pursue our first Resolve. Achil. What are these Omens that Heaven's Anger shew? Agam. My Lord, you may consult what Heaven foretells, About your self; 'Tis known to all the Camp, That the whole fate of Troy depends on you. But then consider, that your Life's the Price, On which the Gods have rated that dear Conquest. Achil. Thus all those Princes, whom your wrongs have summon'd, Must now retire with Shame and Infamy, And leave you unreveng'd: Whilst the Adulterer Securely keeps your Clytemnestra's Sister. Agam. My Lord, your Valour Which did anticipate our warlike Toils, Has it not gloriously, reveng'd those Wrongs? The woes you spread through all the Lesbian State, Keep still affrighted all th'Ãgean Sea; Troy saw with terror your devouring Flames, And even into its Port the rolling Waves, Carried the dismal tokens of your Victory. Nay, moreâThe Trojans mourn a second Hellen, Which now remains your Prisoner at Mycene, For 'tis in vain this Captive Beauty strives, To keep a secret which her Pride betrays, And e'en her silence speaks a noble Birth. Achil. You pry too far into the Gods Decrees: Besides, think you, my Lord, those frivolous Threats, Will 'ere deter Achilles from pursuing, Honour and Glory under your Command? What if the fatal Sisters did fortell. When first my Mother yielded to th'Embrace Of mortal Peleus, that I might choose, Either to live for many Years obscure, Or gain eternal Fame by courting early Death? For since I must at last submit to Fate, I'll ne're be niggard of a Goddess's Blood. When Honour calls, let Oracles be silentâ I own th'Almighty Gods controul our Lives, But Honour, Sir, depends on our own Actions; Then let us not regard what they Decree, But rather strive to equal their Condition By our immortal Deeds. Now since at Troy Both Fame and Victory attend, I fly, And only ask the Winds to waft me o're. Let all th'affrighted Greeks retire with Shame, I and Patroclus will besiege the City, And venge your Wrongs. But no, 'tis you Great Sir, To whom the Gods reserve this Victory; Therefore all my Ambition is to wait On your Commands: And now I wave a Marriage Which call'd me from the Camp: My dutious Love Bids me consult your Honour and your Fame. I will Cheer up the Soldiers, and Secure you From those weak Souls who whisper frightful Tales. [Exit Achilles Ulys. My Lord, You see that nothing can remove, His fixt Design of Marching against Troy; We fear'd his Love, but he himself this Day, Has furnish'd us with Reasons to oppose it. Agam. Alas! Fond Youth! Ulys. You Sigh, My Lord, as if You felt the Murmurs of rebellious Nature? Shall I believe one Night could shake your Mind, And stagger your Resolve? But, Sir, remember, By solemn Vows you have resign'd your Daughter, Calchas, whom all the Greeks consult each Day Depends upon your Promise, and foretells That the propitious Winds will soon return. If his Predictions should now prove abortive, Think you, my Lord, he'll not arraign your Weakness? T'assert the Cause of the Immortal Gods, And prove the Truth of their prophetick Answers? Think you the Greeks provok'd by your Denial, Will calmly see the Oracles contemn'd, And their Religion scorn'd? Beware, my Lord, And fear the Rage of superstitious Zeal. Agam. Barbarous Fate! Ulys. Yet more, my Lord, it was your pressing Call, Has Summon'd all the Grecians to this Shore, By challenging the Promise of those Princes, Who Rivall'd Menelaus, and Courted Hellen; For we all Swore to Tyndarus her Father, That when his Choice was fixt on any one, The rest would yield their Claims, and with Confederate Force Punish the bold outragious Ravisher, That durst insult the happy Husband's Rights. But as 'twas Love that wrested this fond Oath, So that Love ceasing it had been neglected. 'Twas you that drew us from the soft Embrace, Of our dear Consorts, and our dearer Children; Yet, when a noble Fire t'avenge your Wrongs, Does animate the Camp: When Greece proclaims Your Zeal and Wisdom: Nay, when twenty Kings Will Sacrifice their Lives in your Defence, You, Sir, alone refuse the glorious purchase Of Honour and Revenge; a little Blood You think too dear to gain immortal Fame. Must It be said, the General of Greece Employ'd his skill in nothing but Commanding A safe Retreat? Agam. Alas! my Lord, how easily, whilst secure From my impending Woes, you seem undaunted! But was your Son Telemachus the Victim, How soon the ghastly image of his Death, Would turn to Tears your proud insulting Speech? How deep you'd feel the Torments I endure From struggling Nature! And how swift you'd fly To snatch him from the Priest! Yet since my promises past, If my unhappy Daughter meets us here, I'll not recall it, but if kinder Fate Prevents her coming, you'll not think it strange, If I accept the welcome Help of Heaven; Too long your Counsels have prevail'd upon me, I blush to think on'tâ Enter Eurybates. Euryb. My Lordâ Agam. Gods! The News? Euryb. The Queen bid me haste To tell you her Approach: And that she brings Her Daughter, to resign her to your Arms. She had arriv'd before, but that she lost Her way, through those thick Woods that shrowd the Camp. Agam. Oh! Heav'n! Euryb. They are attended By young Eriphile, Achilles's Lesbian Captive, Who being unacquainted with the Parents, Designs to learn her Fate from Renown'd Chalchas. The News of their arrival is now spread Through all the Camp, and with loud Acclamations, The joyful Soldiers crowd about the Queen, And your fair Daughter; some enquire the Cause That brings them hither: Others are contented, To pray the Gods for their Prosperity. But with a common Voice, all bless their General, As the most glorious King, and happy Father. Agam. 'Tis wellâ, you may retireâ, I'll make them welcome. Exit. Eurybates. Thus to secure its Vengeance, angry Heaven Breaks all the Measures of my Policy! Yet if I was allow'd the Priviledge Of soothing Tears, it were some Comfort! But The barbarous Fate of Kings sets us on high, To lie expos'd to all the Bolts of Fortune, And be a gazing-stock to those below. Thus still beset by troublesom Spectators, Tho' most unhappy, we must least complain. Ulys. My Lord, I am a Father, nay, a tender Father, Who feelingly resents your cruel Woe: I shudder at the stroke that makes you sigh, And e'en would weep to countenance your Tears. But your denial can have no Excuse, The Gods have brought their Victim to the Camp, Calchas expects it, and will soon demand it. Yet, whilst we are alone, let flowing Tears Express your Sorrow: Your concern allows them. But, noâ, let rather your undaunted Soul Consider the vast Glory you shall reap. Behold the Hellespont yields to our Oars; Behold our Flames devour perfidious Troy; Her Subjects made your Slaves; King Priamus Grasping your Knees, and Helena restor'd. Behold our numerous Fleet returns to Aulis Crown'd with success: Behold that pompous Triumph, That will be the fam'd Tale of After-ages. Agam. My Lord, I find how weak and impotent, All my Efforts would be t'oppose the Gods. And since it is decreed, that Innocence Must be opprest, Iâ, noâ, I'll never yield: Oh! Cruel Fate! Inexorable Gods! Ulys. My Lord, remember Your solemn Vows, and dread th'Almighty Powers. Consult your Safetyâ; Nay, consult your Honour. Agam. Oh! Hard Necessity! Oh! Wretched Father! Yet engage the Priest To Silence for a while: Let me, at least, Be Guiltless for one Moment: Let me hide, From Clytemnestra, my black, barbarous Arts; And spare her tender Heart the cruel Sight, Of a dear Daughter bleeding on an Altar. [Exit. Agamemnon. Ulys. I've done my Task: Nature and Love give way, The Gods and Honour bear the Sovereign Sway. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter Eriphile, weeping, Doris. Eriph. Doris, Let us retire: And whilst within They feel the Raptures of their mutual Love, Both in a Father, and a Husband's Arms, Here let me vent my unrelenting Grief. Dor. Why, Madam, will you thus provoke your Sorrows? And waste those Beauties with incessant Tears? 'Tis true, nothing seems Charming to a Prisoner, Captivity turns all to Bitterness; Yet, shall I tell it? When we crost the Seas With proud Achilles, when yet a trembling Captive, You view'd your Conquerour, me thought your Eyes Were less employ'd about your Miseries. Now Fortune seems to smile, since Iphigenia Like a fond Sister sooths your Cares with Friendship, And gives those Comforts you had found in Troy. You long'd to come to Aulis, and your Wishes Are all accomplish'd, yet your Grief redoubles. Eriph. What! Dost thou think that sad Eriphile, Can be a calm Spectator of their Joys? Canst thou believe my Griefs will disappear, When I behold a Heaven I cannot reach? Blest Iphigenia hugs the dearest Father, She is the Pride of a fond haughty Mother, Whist from my Infancy expos'd to Dangers, My unknown Parents never Smil'd on me. I am a Stranger to my very self; And to compleat my Woes, the Oracle Bid me continue in my Ignorance; For when I ask to whom I owe my Birth, 'Tis answer'd, in this Knowledge lies my Loss. Dor. But why should this deter you from your Search? All Oracles lie hid in dubious Riddles, Who knows but by the losing a false Name You'll find your own: This, sure, must be the Loss The Oracle foretells, for in your Cradle, Your Name was chang'dâ Eriph. Of all the Circumstances of my Fate, This is the only one I e'er could learn, From thy unhappy Father, who knew all. Indeed he us'd to tell me, that in Troy, I should retrieve my Glory, my true Name, And find my Royal ParentageâBut oh! I had within my view the wish'd-for City, When fierce Achilles led his Conquering Host, 'Gainst Lesbos, and made all yield to his Sword; Thy Father buried in a heap of Dead, Left me a Captive to my self unknown: And of all those great Honours I expected, Vile Prisoner of Greece, I only keep The Pride of a High Birth I cannot prove. Dor. How great's the Loss of such a Faithful Witness! How much you ought to hate the Barbarous Hand That gave the fatal Blow! Yet renown'd Calchas, Who holds a Correspondence with the Gods, And know's what's past, what's present, what's to come, Calchas may, sure, acquaint you with your Fate. Besides, this Camp affords you safe Protection: Kind Iphigenia will soon be joyn'd, In happy Marriage to our Conquerour, And make our Chains the lighter; doubt it not, She has engag'd her Promiseâ Eriph. What! If of all my Woes This fatal Marriage were the cruellest? Dor. How! Madam? Eriph. Be not surpriz'd my Griefs admit no Cure, But rather wonder I have liv'd so long, With such a load of Cares and Misery. I am unknown, a Stranger, and a Captive: All these were littleâBut, oh! I'm a Lover. That fierce Destroyer of the Lesbian State; That fatal Author of our dire Misfortunes, Who with Hands drench'd in Blood made me his Captive, And with thy Father robb'd me of my Birth, Achilles is the dearest Man I view. Dor. Heaven! What do I hear? Eriph. I first design'd Eternal Silence should conceal my Weakness: But I must speak to ease my Soul opprest, And in thy friendly Bosom vent a Secret, Which ought for ever, ever be forgotten. Yet, Doris, ask me not with what fond Hopes, I entertain'd this Passion in my Breast? I will not charge it on that kind Concern, With which Achilles seem'd to sooth my Woes. No, no; 'tis unrelenting Heaven's Decree, Still to pursue me with immortal Hatred, And crush my tender Heart with Cares of Love. Dor. Oh! cruel hopeless Love! Eriph. Shall I call back to my distracted Mind, The sad Remembrance of that dismal Day, When first we lost our Liberty? Speechless and Trembling for a while I lay, Buried in gloomy Night; at last my feeble Eyes, Began to seek the Light, and as I saw The pressing Hand of my fierce Conquerour Reeking with Blood, I fear'd to meet his Looks. As I embark't with him, I still endeavour'd, To shun the dreadful and detested Sight; But, oh! I saw him; saw him with a Blush; Nay, which is more, I saw him with concern. His Aspect was Serene, and my Reproaches Could find no Tongue to Curse the pleasing Foe; My Heart rebell'd against my Miseries, And all my Anger melted into Tears. I follow'd with Delight my Charming Guide, And as I lov'd him then, I love him still. Kind Iphigenia offers me Protection, But all in vain, since my tormenting Furies Bid me lay hold of my Protectress's Hand, Only to crush a Rival, and unseen Disturb those Joys which cause my Sufferings. Dor. Alas! What can your feeble Hate perform? Had it not been much better t'have remain'd Still Prisoner at Mycene; there to quench Your fatal Fires, and shun the cruel Woes Of unregarded Loveâ Eriph. 'Twas my Design; but tho' my Rivals Triumph Threatned my new-born Love with endless Torments, Yet driv'n by Fate, I came: A secret Voice, Bid me attend my Guardianâ Presaging that I might leave on this Shore, All my Misfortunes, and like a Libation, Pour them upon the Heads of these blest Lovers. This is the Reason I appear in Aulis, And not a fond Desire to know my Birth. Or rather I am come to let their Nuptials Pronounce my final Doom; for if accomplish'd, A speedy Death will end my Miseries; And without wasting time in fruitless Search, After my unknown Parentage, the Grave Will hide my Love and Shameâ Dor. How much I do lament your cruel Fate! Enter to them Agamemnon, Iphigenia. Iphig. My Lord, What makes you thus Fly from my Sight; And shun the Clasping of a Daughter's Arms? My dutiful Respect made me forbear, Till the transported Queen had first exprest Her joys in your Embrace, Must Iphigenia, Retire without a Blessing, and a Kiss? May'nt I?â Agam. Yesâyou may embrace a Father, [Embraces her. Who loves you stillâ Iphig. How dear I value such a Father's Love! What pleasing Raptures do I feel, to see Th'Excess of Power and Honour that surrounds you? Fame's busie Tongue had entertain'd my Ears, With wond'rous Tales of your supreme Command; But all comes short of what I now behold; My Joys and my Surprize at once redouble: You have the general Love of all the Grecians, And am I then belov'd by such a Father? Agam. Alas! A Father to so good a Daughter, Deserv'd to be more Fortunateâ Iphig. Is there a greater Fortune can attend a King? I thought you reach'd the Top of humane Bliss, And that the Bounteous Gods could give no more. Agam. Just Heaven! Must I prepare her to her Fate? [Aside. Iphig. You Sigh my Lord, and seem to cast your Looks, Unwillingly upon me; Pray, dear Sir, Is it against your Orders we are come? Agam. Daughter, I see you with a Father's Eye; But at this Time and Place, perplexing Care Disturb my Joysâ Iphig. How sad are the effects of tedious Absence! Alas! can't you forget your high Degree, And learn to be a Father for a moment? Here is no Witness that can make you Blush; You see before you, none but a young Princess, To whom I often told how blest I was With the most Tender and Indulgent Father, Who would at my Request end her Misfortunes. What will she think of your Indifference? Must all her Hopes be vain? Pray, gentle Father, Dispel those Clouds that hover on your Brow. Agam. Alas! My Daughterâ Iphig. My Lord, Go on. Agam. Oh! I cannotâ Iphig. Curst be th'adulterous Trojan, The fatal Author of our dire Alarms! Agam. His Ruin must be bought with Flouds of Tears. Iphig. I hope propitious Heaven will Protect your Head. Agam. The Gods of late seem deaf to all my Prayers. Iphig. Calchas, they say, prepares a Sacrifice. Agam. May Heaven be appeas'd before 'tis Offer'd! Iphig. Pray, when is that to be? Agam. Too soon, Alas! Iphig. Shall I be suffer'd To joyn my Vows with yours before the Altar? Agam. Oh! me! Iphig. My Lord; you're silentâ Agam. NoâYesâYou will be there, My Daughterâ Farewellâ [Exit Agamemnon. Iphig. His cold Reception fills my Mind with Doubts. A secret Horror seizes all my Limbs: I fearâBut know not what, May Heaven avert Th'impending WoesâYet, whom they seem to threaten. The Gods alone can tellâ Eriph. Madam, I wonder that amidst those Cares, Which now employ your Father, a small Coldness Can discompose your Mind? Alas! How anxious My Thoughts must be? Where'er I set my Steps I am a Stranger; Lost and abandon'd from my very Cradle, My unknown Parents never cast upon me A flattering Smile; You, if a cross Father Reject your dutious Love, may yet complain To a fond Mother; nay, if both should prove, Unkind, a Lover will dry up your Tears. Iphig. Yes, dear Eriphile, I own my Tears Will soon be dry'd at my Achilles's view: His worth, my Father, my Heart bid me Love him. Yet, What must I believe of this fond Lover? Who seem'd to burn with longing expectation To meet me here? What keeps him from my Sight? I have, for these two Days, upon our Journey, Sought him with trembling Looks; but all in vain. At last I'm welcom'd by an unknown Crowd, And still he keeps away: Sad Agamemnon Seems shy to name him to me. Where is he? I'm full of Doubts and Fearsâ, What! Have the Cares of War, Chill'd both a Father and a Lover's Heart? But, noâ, I wrong him by unjust Alarms: For he alone did ne're engage his Promise To Hellen's Father: 'Tis on my Account He flies to Troy; I am the only Prize His generous Love expects to Crown his Valour. Enter Clytemnestra, with a Letter in her Hand. Clyt. Daughter, we must be gone, and by a speedy Flight Prevent our Shame; 'tis now no more a Riddle, What made your Father troubled and uneasy To see us here: This Letter clears all Doubts; By faithful Arcas he had sent it to me, To spare us the Affront of a Denial. But wandring from our Way, that Messenger Could not convey it soonerâ He writes, Achilles having chang'd his Mind, Defers the Nuptial Rites till his Return. Eriphil. What do I hear! Clyt. You blush, and seem concern'd at the Abuseâ; But let your Spirit arm you with Disdain. [To Iphigenia Ungrateful Wretch! Deceiv'd by his Renown, I did at Argos countenance his Love, And thought a Goddess's Son would make you Happy. But since his vile Inconstancy belies His noble Offspring from th'unchanging Gods, Let's now despise the basest of Mankind, And fly this hated Shore; lest he should think, We stay to court his dull Indifference. Your Father is acquainted with my Purpose, I only wait him here to take my leave. In the mean time I'll see all Things prepar'd For our departureâ. As for you, Madam, [To Eriphile. You'd think it hard to follow; our Retreat Leaves you in better Hands; too well we know, That 'tis not Chalchas that you came to see. [Exit, Clytemnestra, in a Fury. Iphig. In what amaze of Trouble has she left me, By her perplexing Speech! Achilles having Chang'd his Mind, Defers the Nuptial Rites till he Returns; I must prevent my Shame by hasty Flight; And 'tis not Calchas, that you came to see. [To Eriphile. Eriph. The meaning of her Speech is a dark Riddle, I cannot apprehendâ. Iphig. Nay, Madam, too, too well, You know its meaningâ, yet, if barbarous Fate [In an Ironical Tone. Robs me of a Husband, sure, you'll be more kind Than to abandon me in my Misfortunes. 'Thad been a Torment for you to have staid At Mycene without meâ, Shall the Queen Now leave you here alone? Eriph. Madam, I design'd To consult Calchasâ. Iphig. Then what's the Reason you don't haste to see him? Erip. You speak of being gone within a Moment. Iphig. Sometimes one Moment may clear many Doubts: But, Madam, I'm too pressing: And now plainly see What I could ne're have thoughtâYes, 'tis Achilles Who makes you so uneasie till w'are gone. Eriph. Can you suspect me of such Treachery? I! Madam, Love a furious Conqueror, Whose bloody Image haunts my fearful Mind, E're since with Fire and Sword he spread Destruction, Through all the Lesbian State?â Iphig. Yes, Traytress, Yes, you love the fierce Destroyer: And all those Horrors with which you describe him, His Hands embru'd with Blood, his reeking Sword, And flaming Lesbos are the Characters, Which left his pleasing Image printed in your Soul. This, I remember, this made you so fond, Still to repeat to me the doleful Story Of your CaptivityâI might have seen Your eager Passion through your feign'd Complaints. But my fond Friendship banish'd all Distrust, I hug'd and cherish'd a perfidious Rival; Credulous Fool! I lov'd her: Nay, I offer'd The safe protection of her perjur'd Lover. The Robbing me of him, I could forgive, But to be brought to this detested Shore, To meet th'ungrateful Man who now forsakes me, And grace the Triumph of a treacherous Friend, This, this is an Abuse I cannot bear. Eriph. Madam, you give me Words I ne're was us'd To hear beforeâ; And tho' hard Fate pursues me With cruel Hate, yet such harsh sounds till now, Were Strangers to my Ears; But I excuse Th'unjust Reproaches of an incens'd Lover. Which way could I prevent your Journey hither? Can you suspect Achilles will prefer A forlorn Maid to Agamemnon's Daughter? One, who all she can learn of her Condition, Is, that she is the Offspring of that Blood He longs to spillâ. Iphig. The barbarous Wretch insults o're my Misfortunes! And still compares her vileness to my Glory, Only to heighten her perfidious Triumph. Was this then wanting to my load of Woe? But have a care your Raptures be'nt too rash: That Agamemnon you have dar'd, commands All Greece; He is my Father; nay, he loves me, And feels my Sufferings deeply as my self. My Tears did melt him: I perceiv'd those Sighs He strove to hide from me; Fond Fool! I blam'd That Coldness which his Tenderness had caus'd. Enter Achilles. Achil. Is't possible then, Madam! Do I see you? Or is it fond Delusion? No: For the whole Camp, Assur'd me you was hereâ, But, Madam, What concern Has brought you to this Shore, since Agamemnon, Gave out Mycene would enjoy you still? Iphig. My Lord, fear not my hated Presence here, For Iphigenia will soon be gone. [Exit Iphigenia with a disdainful Air. Achil. She shuns me! Do I wake? Or is't a Dream? Gods! How I am distracted at this Flight! What shall I do?âMadam, can I presume [To Eriphile. To meet your Looks, and not provoke your Hatred? Yet, if Achilles did e're pity you: If you can now receive your Conquerours Prayer, Inform me why they're comeâ, sure, you can tell. Eriph. My Lord, I wonder You should be unacquainted with their Journey; Since you have been a Month upon this Shore, Still pressing their Arrival, and your Nuptials. Achill. I Madam? I was Absent this whole Month, And only came last Nightâ. Eripil. How, When Agamemnon did write to Mycene, Did not your Love Indite and Guide his Hand? I thought you was transported with the Charms Of his bright Daughterâ. Achil. Yes: I still adore her. Nay, if I had consulted but my Love, I would have fled to see her at Mycene. Yet, I am shunn'd; but for what Crime I know not. Where'er I cast my Looks I meet a Foe: And e'en this Moment Calchas and Ulysses Display'd their Eloquence t'oppose my Love, And seem'd to intimate it shock'd my Honour. What can their Counsels mean? Am I abus'd? And made a Tale to entertain the Army? I'll inâ, And wrench the Secret from their Souls. [Exit. Achilles Eriph. Ye Gods! Who see my Shame, Where shall I hide it? Proud Rival, thou art lov'd, and yet thou murmur'st. Must I at once behold thy haughty Triumph, And bear with thy Insults? Noâ, Let me ratherâ: But, Doris, I'm deceiv'd, or some great Storm, Is gathering thick to break upon their Heads. I've Eyes:âTheir Happiness is not yet setl'd. King Agamemnon Sighs, and is in Trouble: He shuns his Daughter: Both avoid Achilles. There's something in it; I'll not yet Despair: And if Fate listens to my Hatred's Call, I'll die, but crush a Rival with my Fall. [Exeunt Eriphile, Doris The end of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Agamemnon, Clytemnestra. Clyt. Yes, my Lord, My Indignation made me leave the Camp, And sly Achilles view: Scorn'd Iphigenia Design'd Mycene should lament her Woe. But that young Hero wondring at our Flight, Call'd all the Gods to prove his Constancy, And stopt our Journey. Nay, he presses now That Marriage, which before, 'twas said, he shunn'd. He seeks you full of Passion and of Love: Furious to know who rais'd this false Report, And punish his audacious Insolence. Therefore let no Suspicions pall our Joys. Agam. Madam, 'tis well: Achilles must be trusted: I own we wrong'd him: And I share your Joys, As much, as least, as my concern allows. Now since you wish that Calchas should perform The Nuptial Sacrifice, 'tis fit you send Your Daughter to the Altar: I'll there wait her coming. Yet first in private let me here advise you: You see what place you're in, how every thing Seems fitter for a Fight, than for a Marriage; The Tumult of an Army, and a Fleet: An Altar bristling with Pikes, Darts and Spears, Such horrid Pomp may sute with fierce Achilles, But is not calm enough to court your Sight, It were unseemly that the Greeks should see, Their Queen bereft of awful Majesty, And undistinguish'd in a Crowd of Soldiers. Believe me, let your Maids alone attend Your Daughter to the Altarâ. Clyt. I, Sir, resign my Daughter to my Women! And not accomplish what I have begun? Have I then brought her hither from Mycene, And shall I now refuse to lend my Hand To lead her to the Priest?âIs not this a Duty Incumbent on a Mother?âWho shall order The Marriage Festival?â Agam. Madam, That might have been your Care In Atreus's Palace: Now you're in a Camp. Clyt. Yes, I am in a Camp, Where the whole Fate of Troy depends on you; Where all the Grecians bow to your Command; Where Thetis's Son will this Day call me Mother; Pray, in what Palace could I e're appear With greater Splendor and Magnificence? Agam. Madam, By all th'immortal Authors of our Race, I do conjure you, grant me this Request: I have my Reasons. Clyt. My Lord, By all those Pow'rs you nam'd, let me intreat you Not to deny my Eyes that blissful shew. Vouchsafe to see me there without a Blush. Agam. I thought much better of a Wife's Compliance, But since my Arguments, and my Intreaties Can have no force to bend your stubborn Mind, Madamâit is my PleasureâI command youâ Obeyâ [Exit Agamemnon. Clyt. Ye Gods above! What makes my Husband use Such barbarous Care to keep me from the Altar. Is he so elevated with his Power, That he disdains to own me for his Wife? Or is his new Command yet so unsettled That he dares not appear with Hellens Sister? But why that Nicety? Yet, since 'tis his Command I willingly submit; my Daughter's Bliss Makes me amends for all; th'indulgent Gods Unite her to Achilles, and my Joys Are Infinite to think she shall be call'dâ But here he comes himselfâ Enter Achilles. Achil. Madam, all things succeed to Crown my Wishes: The King desires no further Satisfaction, But trusts the Raptures of my eager Love. I scarce began to clear my Innocence, When with a kind Embrace he call'd me Son. His Words were few: But, Madam has he told you What happy News was spread at your Arrival? Clyt. What's that, my Lord? Achil. The Gods will be appeas'd: The Priest proclaims That the next Hour by solemn Sacrifice, Neptune will be propitious to our Vows, And wake the drowsie VVinds; sure of his Promise The joyful Mariners unfurl their Sails, And turn their Prows to Troy. As for me, Madam, Tho' I were glad if to indulge my Love The VVinds should still be silent for a while: Tho' with regret I quit the happy Shore, VVhere Iphigenia will soon be mine, Yet with delight I grasp the blest Occasion, To Seal this noble Match with Trojan Blood; And in the Ruins of perfidious Troy, Bury the Shame of that respected Name, To which mine will for ever be allied. Enter Iphigenia, Eriphile, Ãgina, Doris. Fair Princess, all my Bliss depends on you: Your Father waits our coming to the Altar; [To Iphigenia. Haste Madam, to receive the plighted Faith Of your Adorerâ Iphig. My Lord, before we go, I hope the Queen will suffer me to ask you A Boon to prove your Love: Here's a young Princess VVhose noble Aspect speaks her high Descent: Her Eyes continually dissolves in Tears, You know her Troubles, for 'tis you have caus'd them. And I just now transported with rash Passion, Rudely insulted over her Affliction. I would atone for my too-hasty Carriage, And sooth her into Ease, but how I know not, Unless it be by interceeding for her. My Lord, she is your Captive, and those Chains, Whose weight I pity, will at your Command Fall from her Hands: Let then your generous Deeds Begin this happy and auspicious Day. Let sad Eriphile be now discharg'd From our AttendanceâLet all the Grecians see, That the great King to whom I plight my Faith, Is not contented to spread dire Alarms, And wild Destruction through th'affrighted World, But that he can relent at a Wifes Tears, And like the Gods from whom he is Descended, Will be disarm'd by the Unfortunate. Eriph. Yes, my Lord, you may alleviate The quickest Pain a Woman ever felt. 'Tis true the Fate of War made me your Captive; But still you strain too high its rigid Laws, Thus to o're-bear my Heart with all the Torments I suffer here. Achil. You, Madam? Eriph. Yes, my Lord, and waving all the rest, Could you impose a more severe Commnd, Than here to make my Eyes the sad Spectators, Of the Prosperity of all my Foes: My Proud, my Haughty, Persecuting Foes. Where'er I go, I hear th'insulting Threats Of a fierce Army, ready to destroy My native Countrry: And to break my Heart, I see, I see that fatal Hymens Brand, Which will devour it, and consume my Hopes. Therefore permit me to retire from hence: And wandring from your Sight, and still unknown, Bewail the Hardships of that dismal Fate, [Weeps. Which nothing but my Tears can well express. Achil. Fair Princess, that's too much: Wipe of those Tears, You have your Wishes; follow to the Altar, That all the Greeks may witness you are Free; And may the Hour that gives you Liberty, Make me for ever Blest. [Enter Arcas. Arc. Madam, all things are ready for the Sacrifice; To Clytem. The King waits at the Altar for your Daughter, And sends me to Demand herâOr rather, Sir, I come [To Achilles. To beg your help against him. Achil. What say you, Arcas? Clyt. Ye Gods! What News is this? Arc. You alone, my Lord, [To Achilles. Can now Protect her. Cchil. Against whom? Arc. My Lord 'tis with regret I name himâ But I can keep no longer the black Secret, And to be silent would be Treachery. The Knife, the Fillet, the Pile, all is ready; But were that fatal Pomp design'd to take My Life for the Discoveryâyet I must speak. Clyt. Heaven! How I tremble! Quickly; Arcas, Explain your meaningâ Achil. Whoe'er it be, speak boldly, fear him not. Arc. My Lord, you are her Lover; and you, Madam, Her tender Mother; suffer not the Princess To meet her Fatherâ Clyt. What should we fear from him? Achil. Why should we distrust him? Arc. He waits her at the Altar, with intent To Sacrifice herâ Achil. He! Agamemnon! Clyt. His Daughter! Iphig. My Father! Eriph. Oh Heavens! What News! Achil. Gods! What blind Fury Can Arm his cruel Hand against his Daughter? 'Tis Impious but to think on't. Arc. Alas! my Lord, there is no room for Doubt: The Oracle and Calchas have pronounc'd The fatal Doom, and stubbornly reject All other Sacrifice: The Gods themselves Protect the Ravisher, and bid the Winds Lie husht till that be offer'd. Clyt. How can the Gods decree so black a Deed? Iphig. Heaven! VVhat's my Crime, that merits such hard Fate? Clyt. Now 'tis too plain VVhy he impos'd on me such strict Commands, To keep me from the Altar. Iphig. Is this the Marriage was design'd for me? [To Achilles. Arc. The King to blind you, did suppose this Marriage, And the whole Camp is still in the same Error. Clyt. My Lord, [Kneels. Here let me grasp your Kneesâ Achil. Alas! Madamâ [Raising her. Pray riseâ Clyt. My Lord, let me forget my troublesome State: This low Submission suits my cruel Fortune; I were too happy if my Tears could touch, [Weeps. Your Heart with PityâAlass! 'Tis your Bride They snatch away from you. I brought her up To the fond Hopes of this auspicious Match. 'Tis you we sought on this detested Shore; And 'tis your Name betrays her to her Fate. Must she then go t'implore the Angry Gods, And grasp that Altar dismally Adorn'd, To Sacrifice her? You alone are here Her Father, Husband and protecting God. I read your Grief in your distracted Looks. Daughter, I leave you in a Lovers Arms. My Lord, I beg you, stay till I return. I fly to meet my cruel, treacherous Husband, And with just Rage oppose his wild Design. I'll force the Priest to seek another Victim; Or should my best Efforts prove vain, to ward The fatal Blow, I'll die with my dear Daughter. [Exit Clytemnestra. Achil. Madam, all this while My wonder kept me Dumb and Motionless. Was it to me she spoke? Am I Achilles? And must your Mother and a Queen disgrace My noble Passion, to descend thus low VVith unbecoming Posture, Prayers and Tears To move my Pity? VVho is more concern'd Than Thetis's Son in your Prosperity? Yes; you may trust my Love, th'affront is levell'd At me alone: Whatever they attempt, I answer for a Life on which my own depends. But my just Anger does engage me further: 'Twere little to protect, I will revenge you, And punish all at once th'ignoble Cheat, That dar'd t'abuse my Name for your undoing. Ipigh. Pray, My Lord, stayâHear meâ Achil. Gods, must a Barbarian Affront me thus! Whilst to revenge his Sister, I fly to Troy; whilst by my leading Vote, He holds command o're twenty Rival Kings; Whilst for my Services, and Warlike Toils: Whilst for the Price of that great Victory, Which will enrich him, Vindicate his Wrongs, And Crown his Name for ever with Renown; I am contented with the glorious Title Of being yours; the bloody Perjur'd Man Thinks little to despise the sacred Laws Of Love and Nature, and to rack my Soul With the sad view, of your dear, Virgin Heart Reeking upon an Altar, his black Deed Must still be cover'd by a Marriage Pomp; 'Tis I must lead you to the Sacrifice; My credulous Hand must guide the fatal Knife; And in the place of Husband, I must prove Your ExecutionerâGods! I grow Mad to think on't. Iphig. My Lord, let not your Passion thus transport you. Achil. Just Heaven! What had become of all my Hopes, Had not my coming forestall'd your Arrival? The harmless Bride abandon'd to their Fury, Had vainly sought her absent Love, and met A Butcher Priest: Still charging on my Name The bloody, barbarous Cheat. Such Treachery I will expostulate before all Greece Madam, your Honour is concern'd in mine. And therefore you'll approve my just Revenge The cruel Man shall know Achilles's Wrongs Ne're went unpunish'dâ Iphig. My Lord, if ever you did truly Love me, Let now my Prayers and Tears disarm your Anger. Consider that Barbarian whom you dare, That cruel, bloudy, treacherous Enemy, Is still my Fatherâ Achil. Your Father, Madam? NoâHis black Design Leaves him no other than a Murtherer's Name. Iphig. My Lord, I still repeat it, He's my Father: A Father whom I love, whom I revere; A Father who till now has cherish'd me, With all Indulgence and Paternal Care. My Heart brought up e'en from my Infancy, To dutiful Respect, is sad when he's offended. 'Tis not our Nuptial tie can make me lose, My Duty, and allow your furious Passion. Yet, see, my Lord, how very much I love you, Since I could bear to hear th'outragious injury, You offerr'd to his Name. But how can you Think him so barbarous that unconcern'd He'd see his Daughter bleed, if any way He could prevent the cruel Sacrifice. Believe me, Sir, I saw him sigh and weep. Do not condemn him till you hear him speak. Must his Heart, fill'd with Horrors, still encounter Your raging Hatred?â Achil. Is't possible, Madam! Amidst your Danger is this all you fear? A wild Barbarian (for this Name befits him) Betrays you to the Priest like a tame Victim, And when my Tenderness would stop his Fury, You seem concern'd to trouble his Repose; I'm silenc'd, he's excus'd, he is lamented; For him you tremble, and 'tis me you fear. Has then Achilles sued and sigh'd in vain? Is this the Progress of my constant Love? Iphig. Oh! Cruel Man! How can you doubt that Love, Of which I gave you such convincing Proofs? You saw how with dry Eyes, and undisturb'd, I heard the bloody Messenger of Death; But, all ye Powers of Love! How deep was my Despair, When at our first Arrival the false News, Of your inconstancy came to my Ears? My just concern made me accuse the God's, Reproach your Falshood, and curse all Mankind. Then, then you might have seen, how much I value Your Love before my LifeâAlas! I thought My generous Flames had rais'd me o're all Mortals. Perhaps the envious God's have been provok'd, By the Excess of my Felicity. Achil. My Iphigenia, As I am dear to you, be tender of your Life. Enter Clytemnestra, Ãgina. Clyt. We are undone my Lord, unless you save us: My Cruel Husband still avoids my sight, And keeps me from the Altar; 'twas in vain I strove to break my Passage through his Guards. He justly fears a Mothers load complaints. Achil. Then, Madam it becomes me To act your Part: He shall both see and hear me. [Going. Iphig. Alas! Madam!âMy Lord, where will you go? [Stops him. Achil. What will your unjust Prayers expect from me? Must we oppose you first? Clyt. Daughter, what do you mean? Iphig. Madam, by all the Gods! Let's stop a furious Lover, and prevent A dangerous meeting: My Lord, I beg you, stay: Too much of Gall would raise your just Reproaches, Lovers are passionate; my Father's jealous Of his Authority: I know th'Atrides Are fierce and haughty, let more gentle Tongues Melt him to Pity; wondring at my stay He'll soon be here to fetch meâ Then he shall see a Mother's Heart opprest With throbbing Grief: He'll hear a Daughter's sighs; Nay, I'll do more: Instructed by my Love, I'll speak kind Things, and use endearing Arts To rouze in him the Father; to prevent Your Grief, your Fury; and to live for you. Achil. Since 'tis your Will, I yield, and wish your Counsels May yet recal his lost abandon'd Reason. Use all your soft Persuasions to subdue His stubborn, barbarous Heart; and as he tenders His own Repose, let him take care of mine In your dear safetyâBut I wast time In frivolous Talk; tis Deeds that must reclaim him. Madam, compose your Self in your Apartment: [To Clytemnestra. In the mean time I'll see all things prepar'd, For your Defence; and I engage my Faith, Your Daughter's Life's secure, whilest I have breath; The God's and Calchas did her Death foretel, But my Word is the surest Oracle. [Exeunt Omnes. The END of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Eriphile, Doris, they sit on a green Bank near the Sea-Shore. A SONG Set by Mr. PURCEL, and Sung by Mrs. ERWIN. I. Morpheus, thou gentle God of soft Repose, Th'unruly Tumults of my Mind compose; Allay the Fury of my anxious Care, Drive hence black Thoughts, and chase away Despair. Here let indulgent Fancy sooth my Pain, Here let me sleep, and never wake again. II. What's this I feel? What this within my Breast, Strikes such alarms, and will not let me rest? 'Tis Jealousy, tormenting Jealousy! The Bane of Love, tormenting Jealousy! III. I rage, I rave, I burn, my Soul's o'fire: Tortur'd with wild despair, and fierce desire. My Strephon's loss, I cannot, will not bear; I'll be reveng'd, and more than Woman dare. Death, only Death can now my Thoughts employ, I must my Rival, or my self destroy. Dor. Madam, what blind Fury Can make you envy Iphigenia Fate? An hour, and she's no moreâAnd yet you say You never was more jealous of her Bliss. Heavens! What do you mean? What wild Design? Eriph. Yes, Doris, yes: My Heart perplex'd with Cares, Beholds with envious Eyes my Rival's Fate. How kind her Dangers! And how curst my Hopes! Didst thou not see her Triumph? How Achilles Was troubled and concern'd? I saw, I saw it; And shunn'd the signs of her undoubted Bliss. The valiant, proud, insulting, fierce Achilles, Achilles dreadful to all humane kind; Who never knew a Tear, but what he draws From others Eyes: Achilles, who 'tis said, Was suckled by a Lioness or a Tigress; Achilles for her now begins to tremble, Sighs and turns pale, and weeps, and yet thou pitiest Here blest Condition; Death it self were pleasing, If I could purchase fierce Achilles's Tears. [Weeps. Dor. Dear Madam, moderate your Sorrows: Or if you weep, let Iphigenia Bespeak your Tears; she was our kind Protectress, And in an hour she dies.â Eriph. No, Doris, she'll not dieâ Dost thou believe Achilles wept in vain? Thinkest thou his Love and Courage will ly buried In shameful Unconcern? No, he'll prevent All her impending Dangers: Thou shalt find The angry God's pronounc'd this Oracle To raise her Glory, aggravate my Woes, And make her still the dearer to her Lover. Dor. What Reasons, Madam, can breed this Suspicion? Eriph. Dost thou not see How all endeavour to prevent the Blow? The fatal Sentence is still kept a Secret; And tho' all things be ready at the Altar, The Camp is unacquainted with the Victim. Does not this silence speak a wavering Father? What can he do? What Heart of flint or steel Could e're resist th'Assaults he must encounter? The Rage and Fury of an incens'd Wife; A Daughter's Sighs and Tears; the deep Despair Of a whole Family; fond Nature's struggles; Achilles's threatning Love. No, 'tis in vain The God's pronounc'd her Doom, for she shall live I, I alone must be unfortunate. Oh! If I daredâ Dor. Madam, what do you mean? Eriph. Why don't I follow The angry Dictates of my jealous Mind? And publish to the Camp the fatal Sentence, The Oracle pronounc'd, and how by impious Silence They strive to make it void, and save the Victim The God's demandâ Dor. Oh! What a wild Design! Eriph. Oh! What excess of Joy! What Altars would the Trojans raise to me, If vindicating my Captivity, I sow'd Dissension through the Grecian Camp, And arm'd Achilles against Agamemnon! If I could make them lay aside their Quarrel 'Gainst Troy, and turn their Arms 'against themselves! If my malicious Whispers could destroy The Grecian Army, and secure my Country! Dor. Madam, I hear a noiseâ'Tis Clytemnestra: Compose your self, or else avoid her Presence. Etiph, Let's in: And to prevent this hated Marriage, I'll use all meansâThe Gods allow my Passion. [Exeunt Eriphile, Doris. Enter Clytemnestra, Ãgina. Clyt. Thou seest, Ãgina, I must fly my Daughter: So far she is from shedding any Tears, Or trembling for her Life, that she excuses Her cruel Father, and would have my Grief Respect the Hand that strikes the cruel Blow. Oh! Constancy! Oh! Reverence! Oh! Love: Yet to reward all these, my Savage Husband Complains of her Delay. I'll here expect him; For, sure, he'll come t'expostulate with me The reason of her stay. But he appears: Be husht my Passion; let me try how far He can dissemble his base Artifice. Enter Agamemnon. Agam. Madam, what do you mean? How comes this Place Don't offer Iphigenia to my sight? I sent Arcas to demand her from youâ Where have you left her?â What stays her? Is it you? will you not grant My just Request? And do you still persist To follow to the Altar? Clyt. My Lord, if she must go, My Daughter's ready: But does nothing stop you? Agam. Me! Madam? Clyt. But have you taken care of all? Agam. Calchas is ready; th'Altar is prepar'd. I have done all my Duty bid me do. Clyt. My Lord, you tell me nothing of the Victim? Agam. Madam? What means this jealous care? [Aside. Enter Iphigenia. Clyt. Come, Daughter, Come; they only wait for you: Be thankful to a kind, a loving Father, Who will himself conduct you to the Altar. [Weeps. Agam. What do I see! What means my Wive's discourse? Daughter, you weep, and look with downcast Eyes: What's this Disorder? But both the Daughter and the Mother weep. Oh! Arcas! I'm betray'd.â Iphig. Father, be not alarm'd: You're not not betray'd: Command and I'll obey; my Life is Yours, You may retake it without Artifice. With that contented and submissive Heart, With which I did accept a promis'd Husband, If I must needs submit to Heaven's Decree, I'll prove an innocent Victim, and respect The Blow you order; with all due obedience I'll spill that Blood, I have receiv'd from you. Agam. Oh! dutiful Respect! Oh! wondrous Love! Iphig. Yet, if this Reverence, this humble Love Seem to deserve a better Recompense; If you can pity a fond Mother's Grief, My Lord. I dare to say, that as I am Surrounded with bright Honour, I could wish A milder Fate, and that the bounteous God's Would not cut off my Life so near its Spring. 'Tis I first call'd you by the Name of Father; âThat soft, endearing Nameâ 'Tis for that Name so oft you thank'd the God's, 'Tis I made your Delight; with me you learnt To cast off Majesty, and not disdain âWith fond Caresses to assume the Father. Alas! With how much eagerness and Joy, I lov'd to hear the Names of all those Countries You went to Conquer? My presaging Hopes Began t'anticipate the wish'd-for News Of Troy's Destruction, and prepar'd a Feast To grace your Triumph. Little did I think, That to obtain your Victory, my Blood Must first be spill'd by you.â Agam. Oh! She'll un-man me with her tender Words? Iphig. Not that the horror of the threatning Blow Makes me remind You of your former Kindness. Fear not: My Heart still careful of your Fame, Shall ne're expose my Father to a Blush. And had my Life alone been my Concern, My grateful Thoughts had been conceal'd for ever Within my dutious Breast. But, Sir, you know That on my wretched Fate a tender Mother, And a fond Lover fix'd their Happiness. A King whose worth you own, lookt on this Day To light the Torch of our illustrious Hymen; Sure of a Heart, you gave me leave to promise, To his undoubted Love, he thought himself The happiest of Mankind:âBut since he knows Your fatal purpose, judge of his Alarms. You see my Mother's woe, pardon, dear Father, My weak endeavours to prevent their Tears. [Weeps. Agam. Daughter, 'tis but too true: The angry God's Demand a Victim, for what Crime, I know not: But you are nam'd. A cruel Oracle Commands that you shall bleed.â To save your precious Life from the black Doom, My Love prevented your endearing Prayers. I wave to tell you how long I withstood: Believe that Love which you just now attested. This very Night I did recal the Order, Which they before had wrested from my Hand. I sacrific'd to you the cause of Greece, My Ambition, my Safety, nay, my Honour. Arcas was sent to keep you from the Camp, But the God's would not suffer he should meet you; They baffled my Efforts. Oh! Wretched Father, Who vainly Strove to guard, what they pursue! Trust not to my unsettled feeble Power: What Curb could hold a furious Multitude, Freed from th'uneasy yoke of my Command, By holy Zeal, and superstitious Fear? Daughter, your hour is come, and you must yield. But, even in Death, regard your high Degree; And mind a Counsel which I scarce can follow: Since the sad Blow that strikes your Heart shall sink Deeper in mine; yet, let your Constancy, Approve your Birth, and make the God's asham'd Of their black Sentence. GoâLet all the Grecians Know by your Courage, 'tis my Blood they spill. Clyt. No: Do you not bely your fatal Race: 'Tis plain you spring from Atreus and Thyestes. Butcher to your own Daughter, to compleat Your natural Cruelty, you only want To entertain me with the gastly Feast Of all her slaughter'd Limbs. Oh! Barbarian! Is this th'auspicious Sacrifice your care Prepar'd with so much Art and Secrecy? How could your Hand subscribe the black Decree, And not be stopt by th'horror of the Deed? Agam. Oh! Wretched Father! [Wheeps. Clyt. Force not before us a dissembling Woe; Nor think your Tears can prove your Tenderness. What Fights are those you fought in her Defence? What Floods of Blood were spill'd to save her Life? Where's the wild Havock that speaks your Resistance? What Heaps of Slain can silence my Complaints? These Savage Man, these are the Witnesses, By which your Love should shew your just Concern, For Iphigenia's Life. Agam. Madam, the God's must be obey'd: A fatal Oracle pronounc'd her Doom. Clyt. Have not all Oracles a dubious meaning? Are the just God's so pleas'd with murderous Deeds That innocence must bleed? If Hellen's Crime Must be aton'd for in her Family, Let then Hermione be fetch'd from Sparta, She's her own Daughter: Let fond Menelaus With his own Blood redeem his guilty Wife. But what blind Fury leads you to the Altar, To expiate her Crime, and be his Victim? Why must I rend and tear a Mother's Breast, And pay his Fondness with my dearest Blood? Nay, is this Author of so many Jars, This great Disturber of the East and West, A worthy Prize to crown your warlike Toils? How often have we blush'd at her Disgrace? Before your Brother by a fatal Tie Made her his Consort, had not Theseus dared To steal her from her Father? Does not Calchas Assure us that from their clandestine Match A Princess sprung, who still is left unknown? Agam. Oh! Cruel Honour! Unfortunate Alliance! Clyt. But, no: A Brother's Love, his injur'd Honour, Are the least Cares that trouble your Repose. Your Thirst of Empire, nothing can allay; Your haughty Pride of having twenty Kings Attend and fear You: The supreme Command Lodg'd in your Person, these, Oh! Wild Barbarian, These are the Gods to whom you Sacrifice; And careless of the Blow, your Unconcern Courts the Applause of the affrighted Greeks. Too jealous of your fatal envied Power, You're glad to purchase it with your own Blood: And by so dear a Price deterr the Boldness Of your Competitors.âIs this to be a Father? Oh! I grow madâThis cruel Treachery Hurries my Senses into wild Distraction. A Priest, surrounded by a barbarous Crowd, Shall lay his Murdering hand upon my Daughter; Shall Tear her Bosom, and with cruel Eyes Consult her panting Breastâ Whilest I who brought her to the Camp in Triumph, Must return home, disconsolate and attended With black Despair: I must behold the Way Still fragrant with the Flowers strew'd on her Passage No, no: It shan't be said I brought her here, To be thus butcher'd, if with the same Blow You offer not a double Sacrifice. No Tears, No Duty shall e're part me from her, Unless you tear her from my Slaughter'd hands. Barbarous Husband, no less barbarous Father, Come, if you dare, and wrest her from her Mother Daughter, go in: At least this time for all I'll be obey'dâ [Exeunt Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Ãgina. Agamemnon Solus. These are the furious Clamours I expected: These are the loud Complaints I fear'd to hear. Yet, if my wavering and distracted Mind, Fear'd nothing but their Cries, I'd not regard them. Alas! Why did the Gods impose upon me So rigid a Command, yet, leave me still A Father's Heart? Enter Achilles. Achil. My Lord, a strange Report has reach'd my Ears. For both our Sakes I wish it may be false, 'Tis said, and with just horror I repeat it, That Iphigenia by your Command Expires this day; That having silenc'd Nature, And all the Dictates of Humanity, With your own hand you give her to the Priest; That 'tis my Name that brings her to the Altar; That you suppos'd These Nuptials to amuse us; and to make me The shameful Instrument of this black Murder. What say you to't, My Lord? What must I think on't? Agam. My Lord, I never give account of what I do: My Daughter's unacquainted with my Will; But when I think it proper to inform her, You then may learn her Fate: I'll give the Camp My Sovereign Orders.â Achil. Too well I know what cruel Fate attends her. Agam. Then why d'ye ask? Achil. Why I do ask? Ye Gods! Is't possible, That he can dare t'avow so black a Deed? Think you I will approve your wild Design? Think you my plighted Faith, my Love, my Honour, Will e're consent to let your Daughter bleed? Agam. But you, who dare to speak with threatning Voice, Have you forgot who 'tis you ask such Questions? Achil. And have you, Sir, Forgot who 'tis I Love? Whom you affront? Agam. Who bids you be concern'd about my Family? Mayn't I dispose of Iphigenia Unless you be consenting? Am I not Her Father still? Is She your Wife? Mayn't sheâ Achil. Noâshe's yours no moreâ I'm not to be amus'd with frivolous Hopes: You swore she should be mine; and therefore, Sir, As long as I have blood within my Veins, I will maintain those Rights your Promise gave. But, Sir, was't not for me she came to Aulis? Agam. Expostulate with the Gods, 'tis they demand her. Accuse the Priest, Ulysses, Menelaus: Accuse the Camp; nay, first accuse your Self. Achil. Me! Agam. Yes, you: Who greedy of the Eastern Conquest, Quarrel each day with Neptune and the Winds. You who offended at my just Alarms, Have spread your eager Fury through the Camp. My tender Heart had found a way to save her: But Troy is all you wish, all you demand. I stopt the Race which you desir'd to run, Her Death will set it open; Goâdepart. Achil. Hell-Furies! Can I hear and bear all this Is't thus you aggravate your Perjury With base Affronts? What! Did I e're desire T'obtain a Wind with Iphigenia's Blood? What great Concern makes me repair to Troy? For whom do I neglect my Parent Goddess, And my disconsolate Father's fond Advice? Why do I court that Death the Oracle Foretold their Son? What Wrongs are those I suffer'd? Was e're a Trojan Fleet so bold to dare Make a Descent on my Thessalian Shore? Did e're a Ravisher come to Larissa, To steal away my Sister or my Wife? What loss have I sustain'd? Is't not for you, Barbarian as you are, I fly to Troy? For you, whom I invested with Command O're all the Grecian Princes and my self. For you, whom I reveng'd in flaming Lesbos, Before your gather'd Forces met in Aulis. But what prevailing Motive call'd us hither? Was it not to restore a ravish'd Wise To Menelaus? Then who can think I will Be wanting to my self, and tamely yield The Bride I Love. 'Tis true your Brother suffer'd A base Affront; but then has he alone A Right to venge his Wrongs? I too will vindicate My injured honourâI love your Daughter: She only has my Vows: To her I promis'd My Ships, my Soldiers, nothing to your Brother. Let him pursue his Wife, and seek a Triumph The Gods have promis'd to my Blood alone. What's Hellen, Paris, Priamus to me? I only ask my Iphigenia. She, She's the Prize for which I'll quit this Shore, And fly to Troy. Agam. Then, fly from hence: Return to Thessaly. I disingage you from your solemn Vows. Others will come submissive to my Power, To reap those Laurels, which to you were promis'd. And forcing Destiny by glorious Deeds, Will gladly meet their Death before the Walls Of ruin'd Troy. I see through your Contempt, How dear I bought your haughty, proud Assistance. By your insulting Speech it seems you are The Arbiter of Greece, and that I bear An empty Title. To your boast'd Valour All must submit: All follow your Command. A kindness when reproach'd becomes a Wrong: I ask less Valour, but more Obedience. AwayâI cancel all our former Ties, Regardless of your Friendship, or your Hatred. Achil. Thank that one Tie that holds my boiling Passion: I still respect my Iphigenia's Father. But wer't not for that Name, perhaps the Chief Of Twenty Kings had dar'd me once for all. One Word and I have done: But mark me well. Your Daughter and my Honour ly at stake: I will defend them both; And if you'd reach The Heart you aim to strike, This is the way [Points to his Breast. Through which your Blow must pass. [Exit Achilles. Agam. And this shall make her Sentence past recal: My Daughter was more dreadful by her Self. Thy haughty Love, that thinks to make me tremble, Anticipates the Blow, thou meanst to ward. No more Debatesâ It is resolv'd I'll dare his Insolence: My injur'd Honour summons all my Reason, And his proud Threats determine the Contest, 'Twixt Nature and the Gods; for now my Pity Would look like FearâGuardsâ Enter Eurybates, Guards. Euryb. My Lord. Agam. What am I doing! How can I give the bloody, rash Command? Barbarous Man! What Fight doest thou Prepare? What hated Foe, Art thou exposing to their Violence? A Mother waits me: An undaunted Mother, Who will defend her 'gainst a murdering Father. I shall behold my Men less cruel than my self, Respect my Daughter guarded by their Queen. 'Tis true Achilles threatens and contemns me: But still my Daughter's constant to her Duty; She neither flies the Altar, nor declines With murmuring Discontent the Blow I give. What means my horrid, sacrilegious Zeal? What Vows can I address for such a Victim? A glorious Harvest waits me: But what Laurels Can please, when stain'd by Iphigenia's Blood? I will appease the angry Gods: But, oh! What Gods, can be more cruel to me, than I am to my Self? No: 'twill not be. I yield to Love, to Nature: I'll not blush at my Pity, she shall live. But what! Am I Regardless of my Fame? Must proud Achilles Carry the Day, and think I fear'd his Threats? What frivolous care disturbs my anxious Mind! He loves my Daughter: She'll make another blest.âEurybates Call hither Clytemnestra and the Princess: Tell them they need not fear.â [Exit Eurybates. Almighty Powers! If your immortal Hatred perseveres To wrest her from my Hands, what can weak Mortals do, I know my Love destroys what I would save: Yet such a Victim does at least deserve A confirmation of your rigorous Laws, And that you should demand it once again. Enter Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Eriphile, Ãgina, Doris, Eurybates. Madam, you and your Daughter may depart: Her safety be your Care. Haste from this Place Where cruelty bears sway. My Guards, commanded By Arcas, shall attend you; I excuse His happy Rashness. Secrecy and Speed Are now requir'd: Both Calchas and Ulysses Have hitherto been silent; and therefore Take heed they're not acquainted with your Flight, Disguise your Daughter, that the Camp may think I keep her here, and send you back alone. Go, Flyâ And may the Gods contented with my Tears, [Weeps. Spare me the sight of Iphigenia For a long time.âGuards, attend the Queen. Clyt. Oh! Husband! [Weeps. Iphig. Oh! Father! [Weeps. Agam. Once more, avoid th'impatient, barbarous Priest: Be gone, fly henceâTo favour your Escape I'll find some Reasons to make him suspend, The fatal Sacrifice till the next day. [Exeunt all but Eriphile, Doris. Eriph. Doris, this Way. Dor. Madam, don't you follow? Etiph. Oh! I yield at last. I feel the Power of Jealousy and Love: Achilles's Tenderness fills me with Rage. It is resolved, I'll be reveng'd or fall, Come, to the Priest I will discover all. [Exeunt Eriphile, Doris. The END of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter Iphigenia, Ãgina holding her. Iphig. Ãgina, cease to stop me: Go, return To my abandon'd Mother: Th'angry Gods Must be appeas'd; see how they are provok'd By our Efforts to rob them of their Victim. Behold what Storm is gathering thick around us: Consider to what State the Queen's reduc'd; See how the furious Camp prevents our Flight: How with bold Insolence their pointed Spears Stop up our Passageâ Ãgin. Dear Madam, stay: Don't run to certain Ruin. Iphig. All hopes are vanish'd: Our Guards repuls'd: My Mother in a Swoon: Oh! Why should I expose her any more? Or wait her feeble help in vain? No, rather Let me fly from her, whilest her troubled Senses Will suffer me to meet my cruel Fate. See, see how all conspires for my undoing, For even my Father when he bids me Live, Commands my Death.â Ãgin. He, Madam? How! Iphig. Achilles, I suppose, offended him, Too eager to defend his injur'd Love. Yet, as he hates him, I must hate him too. My Heart must offer up this Sacrifice, This horrid, cruel, Sacrifice of Love. Arcas declar'd to me my Father's Will: He orders I shall never speak to him. Ãgin. Oh! Cruel Father! Iphig. Oh! Fatal Doom! Oh! Rigorous Decree! The milder Gods demanded but my Life; Then let's obey: Let's die:âWhat do I see? Heaven! 'Tis Achilles. Enter Achilles. Achil. Come, Madam, follow me: Fear not the Tumult Of that weak crowd that presses round this Tent. Do but appear: You'll see this Multitude Ne're dare to stand the fierceness of my Blow, But open of themselves to let you Pass. My Friend Patrocles, with some other Captains That follow my Command, fly to your Succour With all the Choice of my Thessalian Troops. The rest assembled near my Tent will offer Th'impenetrable Bulwark of their Ranks. Behind this shelter you may bid defiance To all your Persecutors: Let who dares Approach Achilles's Tent. But, Madam, is't thus You second my Efforts? And answer me Only with Tears? You try'd their feeble Succour Before your Father, yet 'twas all in vain. Iphig. My Lord, too well I know it, and therefore I have no hopes but from my certain Death. Achil. Oh! Name not Death: Consider by what Tie You're join'd to me: Consider all my Bliss Depends on you.â Iphig. No, No: The Gods did ne're intend To fix your Bliss on my unhappy Days. Our Love deceiv'd us: 'Tis by Heaven decreed My speedy Death shall cause your Happiness. My Lord, consider what a Crop of Glory Vict'ry presents to crown your warlike Toils. Yet all those Fields of Honour will prove barren, Unless besprinkled with my fatal Blood. In vain my Father strove t'evade the Sentence That Calchas had pronounc'd: Th'immortal Gods Loudly declare their Will by the whole Camp Combin'd for my undoing.â Achil. Madam, Achilles will encounter the whole Camp, And silence their loud Threats. Iphig. My Lord, Let not my Life deprive you of your Honours: Make good the Oracle: Go, Signalize That famous Heroe promis'd to our Country, And wreak you Grief upon its cruel Foes. Now Priamus turns Pale: Now Troy alarm'd Does fear my funeral Pile, and dreads your Tears. Lay waste the hated City: Leave my Death To be lamented by the Trojan Widows. I die contented with these pleasing Hopes, That if my cruel Stars do not permit, I should live happy with my dear Achilles, Yet After Ages will record my Name With your immortal Deeds, and that my Death, The Spring of your fam'd Actions, will begin The wondrous Story.â Farewel, my Prince: Blest Off-spring of the Gods Farewel.â Achil. No, no: You shall not take your fatal leave: In vain your cruel and perswading Arts, Slily endeavour to deceive my Love, And serve your barbarous, inhumane Father; In vain you're obstinate to your undoing, And strive to make my Honour an Accomplice; That Crop of glorious Laurels, that Renown, I find them all in saving what I Love. Who, for the future, would court my Assistance, If I could not secure my promis'd Bride? My Love, my Honour, both bid you should live. Madam, obey their Call, and follow me. Iphig. What! Sir, rebel against my Father! And so deserve that Death you bid me shun! What must become of my Respect, my Duty? Achil. Discharge them both in following a Husband, Your Father has approv'd. In vain he strives To rob me of that Title; I'll ne're suffer The Violation of his solemn Promise. Madam, your Self, whom rigid Duty aws, Did not you own him as your Father, when He gave You to me? Do you only follow His sovereign Will when ceasing to be Father, He Murders his own Daughter? But, Madam, we waste Time, and my just Fearsâ [Goes to lead them away Iphig. What! My Lord, would you force me from my Duty, And hurried by your fierce and impious Passion Compleat my cruel Woes? How can you be Less tender of my Honour than my Life? Alas! My Lord, spare Iphigenia: Spare my Affliction. I have broke already That rigorous Law I ought to reverence. I'm guilty even to hear you speak: Let not Your unjust Vict'ry go any further. Use with this Hand I'll fall a Sacrifice, To my wrong'd Duty, and so free my self From your unkind and dangerous Assistance Achil. Well: I have done: Go, cruel Fair, Obeys And meet that Death you Court: Resign to Calchas A Heart which I find more hate for me, Than Duty to your Father. A just Fury Seizes my Soul, and animates my Courage. If th'angry Gods are fond of Death and Murder, Their Altars did ne'er reek with so much Blood As I shall spill; My angry Love shall cancel All Duty and Respect; the Priest shall first Be sacrific'd, and satisfy the Gods. The funeral Pile broke down with my own Hands Shall swim adrift amidst your Murderer's Gore. And if in this wild havock, your own Father Should fall, you'll see th'effect of your rash Duty, And know the fatal Blow your Honour Guides.â [Exit Achilles abruptly. Iphig. My Lord! My cruel Lord! But he flies from me! [Goes to stop him. Just Heaven! By whose unchangeable Decree, My Death is order'd, here whilest yet alone, End both my Life and Fears: Let all your Bolts be spent On Iphigenia's devoted Head, Enter Clytemnestra, Arcas, Eurybates, Guards. Clyt. Yes: I'll defend her against all the Army: Base Villains, you betray your hopeless Queen. Arc. Madam, do but Command, you'll see us Fight And die in your Defence. But yet Consider How little you must hope from our weak Hands. What can we do 'gainst all your numerous Foes? 'Tis not a giddy Crowd we must encounter, But an embattled Camp, whose furious Zeal, Supports the Priest with superstitious Boldness. All's deaf to Pity: Tenderness is silenc'd; Calchas alone bears Rule and domineers, 'Tis rigid Piety demands the Victim. The King himself, bereft of his Command, Bids us give way and shun th'impetuous Torrent. In vain th'invincible and fierce Achilles Would strive t'oppose the Storm with dauntless Courage; Madam, what can he do? What Valour could dispel That Multitude of Foes that will surround him. Clyt. Then let them come and prove their impious Zeal. On forlorn me: Let their blind Fury take The weak Remainder of my wretched Life. Death, Death alone is able to unclasp My grasping Hands from Iphigenia. My Soul shall first be sever'd from my Body Than I from my dear Daughterâ [Lays hold on Iphigenia Iphig. Oh! Madam! What cruel Star did rule That inauspicious Day when you brought forth Th'unhappy Object of your tender Love? Alas! What can your weak Efforts perform, Abandon'd as we are? You must encounter Both Gods and Men confederate to undo me. Meet not the Rage of a fierce Multitude: Let not your Fondness lead you to the Camp, Against a Husband's Orders, and alone Strive not in vain to save meâ Don't aggravate my Woes with the sad View Of a dear Mother basely dragg'd along By a licentious Band of furious Soldiers. Goâlet the Greeks appease the angry Gods; And leave for ever this detested Shore. Fly from the sight of those devouring Flames. Which would oppress your tender Heart with Grief While they consume your Guiltless Daughterâ And, as you love me with Maternal Fondness, I beg you ne're reproach my Father with my Death. Clyt. What! Not reproach the wild Barbarian, Who leads his Daughter to a Murdering Priest! Iphig. Madam, Consider All he has done to save me, and prevent Your cruel Woe. Clyt. Oh! By what Treachery The barbarous Man deceiv'd me! Iphig. Madam, He but resigns me to the Gods That gave me to him: Yet Death takes not from you The only off-spring of your nuptial Joys. Your mutual Loves have still another Pledge Is young Orestes: May he prove less fatal To his dear Mother, than his wretched Sister. Madam, You hear the Voice of an impatient People. [Shoutings within. Summon your Constancy; Pray, let me goâ Now take my last Farewelâ [Clytemnestra faints. Arcas, Lead to the Altar. [Exeunt Iphigenia, Arcas. Clyt. Where? Where's my Daughter? [Recovering. No, no, you shall not go aloneâ But I am stoptâ [Guards stop her Passage. Villains, treacherous Villains let me go Or satisfy your Thirst of Blood in me. Ãgin. Madam, what would you do? Where would [Holding her. You run? Clyt. Alas! My Spirits waste in fruitless struggles: I still relapse into that faint disorder, Which I had scarce recover'dâMust I live Only to die a thousand Deaths! Ãgin. Curst be that treacherous, inhumane Serpent Your Daughter cherish'd in her friendly Bosom. Curst be Eriphile, whose jealous Fury Reveal'd our Flight to Calchas and the Camp. Clyt. Oh! Monster, whom Tisiphone brought forth! Monster, whom Hell convey'd into our Bosoms! Monster of Envy, Jealousie and Rage! What! Shalt thou live! Must thy black Treachery Remain unpunish'd! But why should my Grief Demand so poor a Victim? Shall then just Neptune see his Banks distain'd With innocent Blood, and not devour the Grecians In the dark Bottom of the watry Deep? Shall then the Winds, whom they so long accus'd, Be Partners in their Crime, and not destroy Their guilty Fleet? And Thou, immortal Sun, who on this Shore Beholdst the Son and Heir of bloody Atreus: Thou, who disdain'd to light the barbarous Feast Of his inhumane Father, now withdraw Thy Beams, and shine not on this impious Deed. But now, Oh! Heaven! Oh! Earth! Oh! Wretched Mother! With fatal Garlands Iphigenia crown'd, Like a tame Victim, waits the cruel Knife Her Father has prepar'd; the murderous Priest Is just ready to strikeâHold, Butchers, hold; The Blood you spill derives from mighty Joveâ HoldâHold. [Runs off with her Maids. [Exeunt Omnes. While a Symphony is playing an Altar is rais'd near the Sea-Shore. Enter King Agamemnon weeping; Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, Arcas, &amp;c. Calchas the High Priest; Iphigenia between two Priests; Eriphile, Doris. A CHORUS of PRIESTS. The INVOCATION to DIANA. I. Oh! Diana! Whose dread Eyes Delight in humane Sacrifice: Oh! Diana! Cease to frown And with gentle Smiles look down, While with flowry Wreaths we this fair Victim crown. Chorus. Crown, Crown, the Victim Crown That bleeds for bright Renown; And on her Virgin head The pure Libation shed, While these to chaste Diana holy measures tread. II. Guardian of each Hill and Grove, And Queen of the great Gods above, Fill, oh! Fill with prosperous Gales Our spreading Sails; And to the Phrygian Coast Convey the Grecian Host; That with avenging Arm's they may destroy, Th'adulterous Guest, with his perfidious Troy. Chorus. That with avenging Arms, &amp;c. &amp;c. III. This Royal Victim our atonement makes, For hark! The slumbring Winds awakes; See, see the Fleet now big with War, Flys swiftly to the Trojan Shoar. Hark! Hark! Now the glorious Din's begun, Last Chorus. Now, now the Drums rattle, And all around, The loud Trumpets resound, And Clanglors rebound, Oh! The wild Furies of Battle! The Victory's won, They run, they run, they run: Io! Io! Victoria! They all shout amain, Victoria! Great Hector, great Hector is slain Troy's won: Her lofty Towers tumble all, See, see, how they fall, Io! Io! Victoria! Victoria! Last Chorus. Now, now the Drums rattle, &amp;c. &amp;c. As Iphigenia is leading to be Sacrific'd the Sun is Eclips'd; Skrieks in the Air; Subterranean Groans and Howlings; Thunder. Calch. What mean these Horrors! The Sun withdraws his beamy Light; the Air Is fill'd with hideous Skrieks, and gloomy Hell Sends up fierce Groans and Subterranean Cries. Almighty Jove himself, with threatning Thunder, Declares his Wrath; all Nature is in Pain. Eriph. Oh! Doris, how I tremble. [Clashing of Swords within. Enter Achilles, Patroclus, and Followers. Achil. Where! Where's my Iphigenia! Hold, Murderers, hold! Calch. My Lord, contain your Passion: I bid you, hold. The Gods themselves are angryâThey must first be heard. [Thunder. Calchas goes behind the Altar to consult the Oracle and then returns with a wild, staring Look, trembling Hands, &amp;c. I'll speak, I'll speak: Let all the Camp be silent: Achilles be attentiveâ The Goddess we adore unfolds the Oracle, And speaks Her Will by my prophetick Tongue. Another Princess of the Blood of Hellen, Another Iphigenia must fall a Victim. From Hellen ravish'd by bold Theseus A Princess sprung call'd Iphigenia, Who still remains unknown. I saw, I saw my self th'unhappy Fruits Of their unlawful Love; and even then foretold Her fatal Doomâ By Destiny's impulse, and her own Furies, She's come to Aulis with a borrow'd Name. She sees, she hears me: There she stands: 'Tis she Points to Eriphile. The Gods demand.â As Calchas is going to lay hold on Eriphile; snatches the Knife. Eriph. Butcher, avaunt! Let not thy impious Hands Prophane that Blood from which thou sayst I spring Now, Doris, all my Fears are come to pass: [To Doris. Yet, tho' the angry Goddess bids me die, I fall a Victim to a greater Power. Almighty Love now strikes the fatal Blow: [Stabs her self. Achilles, DearâAchilles.â [Dies. Iphig. Unhappy Maid! Thunder and Lightning; The Altar is lighted; The flat Scene opens, and discovers a Heaven at a distance; Diana, in a Machine, crosses the Stage; the Priests worship as she passes. Calch. Great Sir, the Gods are satisfied; [Gives Iphig. to Agamem. And Iphigenia is yours again. Agam. Must I believe my Eyes! Oh! Sir! Oh! Daughter! [Embraces her. Achil. Oh! Infinite of Joy! Arcas, fly to the Queen, [To Arcas. Tell her the Princess lives. My Lord, I hope [Exit Arcas. You will forgetâ. [To Agamemnon. Agam. Yes: I forget all: Nay, I forget my self, I'm lost in Joy. The Gods are reconcil'd and so shall you and I. [Embraces him. My Daughter shall be Yours: The Queen shall give her; Thus I will recompense her cruel Woe, Thus I'll atone for my Barbarity. [The Winds and Sea roar; Shoutings. Achil. Oh! Transports of Delight! Oh! Rapturous Bliss! My Love is crown'd; The Winds begin to roar, And fill our spreading Sails; to Troy, to Troy, To Victory and Fame.â Calch. Let After-Ages learn from this great Day, To reverence the Gods's supreme Decrees: For they are just, and ever recompense, True Piety, and spotless Innocence. FINIS.</field>
