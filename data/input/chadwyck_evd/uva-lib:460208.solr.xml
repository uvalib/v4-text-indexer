      <field name="fulltext">ELFRIDA; WRITTEN ON THE MODEL OF THE ANCIENT GREEK TRAGEDY. FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1751.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGUMENT. Edgar, King of England, having heard the beauty of Elfrida, daughter of Orgar Earl of Devonshire, highly celebrated, sent his favourite Minister Athelwold to the father's castle, to discover whether she was really so beautiful, as fame reported her to be; and if she was, to offer her his Crown in marriage. Athelwold, on seeing her, fell violently in love with her himself; and married her; conveying her soon after to his own castle in Harewood Forest, where he visited her by stealth from court; and in his absence left her with a train of British Virgins, who form the Chorus. After three months, Orgar, disapproving this confinement of his daughter, came disguised to Harewood to discover the cause of it. His arrival opens the Drama. The incidents which are produced by Athelwold's return from court (who was absent when Orgar came to his castle), and afterwards by the unexpected visit of the king, form the Episode of the Tragedy; the feigned pardon of Athelwold, drawn from the king by the earnest intercession of Elfrida, brings on the Peripetia, or change of fortune; and the single combat between the king and Athelwold, in which the latter is slain, occasions Elfrida to take the vow, which completes the Catastrophe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Orgar, Earl of Devonshire. Chorus, of British Virgins. Elfrida, Daughter to Orgar. Athelwold, Husband to Elfrida. Edwin, a Messenger. Edgar, King of England. Orgar, disguised in a Peasant's habit, speaks the Prologue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a Lawn before Athelwold's Castle in Harewood Forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ORGAR. How nobly does this venerable wood, Gilt with the glories of the orient sun, Embosom yon fair mansion! The soft air Salutes me with most cool and temp'rate breath; And, as I tread, the flow'r-besprinkled lawn Sends up a gale of fragrance. I should guess, If e'er Content deign'd visit mortal clime, This was her place of dearest residence. Grant Heav'n! I find it such. 'Tis now three months, Since first Earl Athelwold espous'd my daughter. He then besought me, for some little space The nuptials might be secret; many reasons, He said, induc'd to this: I made no pause, But, resting on his prudence, to his will Gave absolute concurrence. Soon as married, He to this secret seat convey'd Elfrida; Convey'd her as by stealth, enjoy'd, and left her: Yet not without I know not what excuse Of call to court, of Edgar's royal friendship, And England's welfare. To his prince he went And since, as by intelligence I gather, He oft returns to this his cloister'd wife; But ever with a privacy most studied; Borrowing disguises till inventive art Can scarce supply him with variety. His visits, as they're stol'n, are also short; Seldom beyond the circuit of one sun; Then back to court, while she his absence mourns Full many a lonely hour. I brook not this. Had Athelwold espous'd some base-born peasant, This usage had been apt: but when he took My daughter to his arms, he took a virgin, Through whose rich veins the blood of British kings Ran in unsullied stream. Her lineage sure Might give her place and notice with the noblest In Edgar's court. Elfrida's beauty too (I speak not from a father's foolish fondness) Would shine amid the fairest, and reflect No vulgar glory on that beauty's master. This act bespeaks the madman. Who, that own'd An em'rald, jasper, or rich chrysolite, Would hide its lustre, or not bid it blaze Conspicuous on his brow? Haply Athelwold May have espous'd some other. 'Sdeath! he durst not. My former feats in arms must have inform'd him, That Orgar, while he liv'd, would never prove A traitor to his honour. If he has ? This aged arm is not so much unstrung By slack'ning years, but just revenge will brace it. And, by yon awful heav'nâBut hold, my rage. I came to search into this matter coolly. Hence, to conceal the father and the earl, This pilgrim's staff, and scrip, and all these marks Of vagrant poverty. CHORUS (within.) Hail to thy living light, Ambrosial Morn! all hail thy roseate ray! ORGAR. But hark, the sound of sweetest minstrelsy Breaks on mine ear. The females, I suppose, Whom Athelwold has left my child's attendants; That, when she wails the absence of her lord, Their lenient airs, and sprightly-fancied songs, May steal away her woes. See, they approach: This grove shall shroud me till they cease their strain; Then I'll address them with some feigned tale. [He retires. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Hail to thy living light, Ambrosial Morn! all hail thy roseate ray: That bids young Nature all her charms display In varied beauty bright; That bids each dewy-spangled flow'ret rise, And dart around its vermil dies; Bids silver lustre grace yon sparkling tide, That winding warbles down the mountain's side. I. 2. Away, ye Goblins all, Wont the bewilder'd traveller to daunt; Whose vagrant feet have trac'd your secret haunt Beside some lonely wall, Or shatter'd ruin of a moss-grown tow'r, Where, at pale midnight's stillest hour, Through each rough chink the solemn orb of night Pours momentary gleams of trembling light. I. 3. Away, ye Elves, away: Shrink at ambrosial Morning's living ray That living ray, whose pow'r benign Unfolds the scene of glory to our eye, Where, thron'd in artless majesty, The cherub Beauty sits on Nature's rustic shrine.â CHORUS, ORGAR. CHORUS. Silence, my sisters. Whence this rudeness, stranger, That thus has prompted thine unbidden ear To listen to our strains? ORGAR. Your pardon, Virgins: I meant not rudeness, though I dar'd to listen; For ah! what ear so fortify'd and barr'd Against the force of powerful harmony, But would with transport to such sweet assailants Surrender its attention? Never yet Have I pass'd by the night-bird's fav'rite spray, What time she pours her wild and artless song, Without attentive pause and silent rapture: How could I then, with savage disregard, Hear voices tun'd by nature sweet as her's, Grac'd with all art's addition? CHORUS. Thy mean garb, And this thy courtly phrase but ill accord. Whence, and what art thou, stranger? ORGAR. Virgins, know These limbs have oft been wrapt in richer vest: But what avails it now? all have their fate; And mine has been most wretched. CHORUS. May we ask What cruel causeâ ORGAR. No! let this hapless breast Still hide the melancholy tale. CHORUS. We know, There oft is found an avarice in grief; And the wan eye of Sorrow loves to gaze Upon its secret hoard of treasur'd woes In pining solitude. Perhaps thy mind Takes the same pensive cast: if not, permit That we, in social sympathy, may drop The tender tear. ORGAR. Ah! ill would it become ye, To let the woes of such a wretch as I am, E'er dim your bright eyes with a pitying tear. CHORUS. The eye, that will not weep another's sorrow, Should boast no gentler brightness than the glare, That reddens in the eye-ball of the wolf. Let us intreatâ ORGAR. Know, Virgins, I was born To ample property of lands and flocks, On this side Tweeda's stream. My youth and vigour Achiev'd full many a feat of martial prowess: Nor was my skill in chivalry unnoted In the fair volume of my sovereign's love; Who ever held me in his best esteem, And closest to his person. When he paid, What all must pay, to fate; and short-liv'd Edwy Mounted the vacant throne, which now his brother Fills (as loud fame reports) right royally; I then, unfit for pageantry and courts, Sat down in peace among my faithful vassals, At my paternal seat. But ah! not long Had I enjoy'd the sweets of that recess, Ere by the savage inroads of base hinds, That sallied frequent from the Scottish heights, My lands were all laid waste, my people murder'd; And I, through impotence of age unfit To quell their brutal rage, was forc'd to drag My mis'ries through the land, a friendless wand'rer. CHORUS. We pity and condole thy wretched state, But we can do no more; which, on thy part, Claims just returns of pity: for whose lot Demands it more than theirs, whom fate forbids To taste the joys of courteous charity; To wipe the trickling tears, which dew the cheek Of palsied age; to smooth its furrow'd brow, And pay its gray hairs each due reverence? Yet such delight we are forbid to taste! For 'tis our lord's command, that not a stranger, However high or lowly his degree, Have entrance at these gates. ORGAR. Who may this tyrantâ CHORUS. Alas! no tyrant he; the more our wonder At this harsh mandate: tenderness and pity Have made his breast their home. He is a man More apt, through inborn gentleness, to err In giving mercy's tide too free a course, Than with a thrifty and illiberal hand To stint its channel. This his praise you'll hear The universal theme in Edgar's court: For Edgar ranks him first in his high favour; Loads him with honours, which the Earl receives, As does the golden censer frankincense, Only to spread a sacred gale of blessings Around on all. ORGAR. Methinks, this pleasing portrait Bears strong resemblance of Lord Athelwold. CHORUS. Himself: no Briton but has heard his fame. ORGAR. 'Tis wond'rous strange; can you conceive no cause For this his conduct? CHORUS. None, that we may trust. ORGAR. Your garbs bespeak you for the fair attendants Of some illustrious dame, the wife, or sister Of this dread Earl. CHORUS. On this head too, old man, We are commanded a religious silence; Which strictly we obey: for well we know Fidelity's a virtue that ennobles Ev'n servitude itself: Farewell, depart With our best wishes; we do trespass much To hold this open converse with a stranger. ORGAR. Stay, Virgins, stay; have ye no friendly shed, But bord'ring on your castle, where these limbs Might lay their load of mis'ry for an hour? Have ye no food, however mean and homely, Wherewith I might support declining nature? Ev'n while I speak, I find my spirits fail; And well, full well, I know, these trembling feet, Ere I can pace a hundred steps, will sink Beneath their wretched burthen. CHORUS. Piteous sight! What shall we do, my sisters? To admit This man beneath the roof, would be to scorn The Earl's strict interdict; and yet my heart Bleeds to behold that white, old, rev'rend head Bow'd with such misery.âYes, we must aid him. Hie thee, poor Pilgrim, to yon neighb'ring bow'r, O'er which an old oak spreads his awful arm, Mantled in brownest foliage, and beneath The ivy, gadding from th' untwisted stem, Curtains each verdant side. There thou may'st rest; There too, perchance, some of our sisterhood May bring thee speedy sustenance. ORGAR. Kind Heav'n Rewardâ CHORUS. Good Pilgrim, stay not here to thank us, But haste to give thine age this meet repose. That done, we do conjure thee leave the place With cautious secresy; for was it known, That thus we trespass'd on our lord's command, The consequence were fatal. ORGAR. Fairest Maid! Think not I'll basely draw down punishments On my preservers. I retire. May blessings Show'r'd from yon fount of Bliss repay your kindness. [Exit Orgar. SEMICHORUS. Yes, sisters, yes, when pale distress Implores your aiding hand, Let not a partial faithfulness, Let not a mortal's vain command Urge you to break th' unalterable laws Of heav'n-descended Charity. Ah! follow still the soft-ey'd Deity; For know, each path she draws Along the plain of life, Meets at the central dome of heart-felt joy. Follow the soft-ey'd Deity; She bids ye, as ye hope for blessings, bless. Aid then the gen'ral cause of gen'ral happiness. SEMICHORUS. Humanity, thy awful strain Shall ever greet our ear, Sonorous, sweet, and clear. And as amid the sprightly-swelling train Of dulcet notes, that breathe From flute or lyre, The deep base rolls its manly melody, Guiding the tuneful choir; So thou, Humanity, shalt lead along Th' accordant passions in their moral song, And give our mental concert truest harmony. CHORUS. But see, Elfrida comes. Should we again resume our former strain, And hail the Morn that paints her waking beauties; Or stay her gentle bidding? Rather stay; For, as I think, she seems in pensive mood; And there are times, when to the sorrowing soul Ev'n harmony is harshness. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Oh, my Virgins, With what a leaden and retarding weight Does Expectation load the wing of Time? Alas, how have these three dull hours crept on, Since first the crimson mantle of the morn Skirted yon gay horizon? Say, my friends, Have I miscounted? Did not Athelwold At parting fix this morn for his return? This dear, long-wish'd-for morn? He did, he did, And seal'd it with a kiss; I could not err. And yet he comes not. He was wont outstrip The sun's most early speed, and make its rising To me unwish'd and needless. This delay Creates strange doubts and scruples in my breast. Courts throng with beauties, and my Athelwold Has a soft, susceptible heart, as prone To yield its love to ev'ry sparkling eye, As is the musk-rose to dispense its fragrance To ev'ry whisp'ring breeze; perhaps he's false, Perhaps Elfrida's wretched. CHORUS. See, Elfrida, Ah see! how round yon branching elm the ivy Clasps its green folds, and poisons what supports it. Not less injurious to the shoots of Love Is sickly jealousy. ELFRIDA. My mind nor pines With jealousy, nor rests secure in peace. Who loves, must fear; and sure who loves like me, Must greatly fear. CHORUS. Yet whence the cause? Your Earl Has ever yet (this little breach excepted) Been punctual to appointment. Did his eye Glow with less ardent passion when he left you, Than at the first blest meeting? No! I mark'd him, His parting glance was that of fervent love, And constancy unalter'd. Do not fear him. ELFRIDA. I should not fear him, were his present stay The only cause. Alas, it is not so! Why comes my Earl so secret to these arms? Why, but because he dreads the just reproach Of some deluded fair one! Why am I Here shrouded up, like the pale votarist, Who knows no visitant, save the lone owl, That nightly leaves his ivy-shrouded cell, And sails on slow wing through the cloister'd isles, List'ning her saintly orisons? Why am I Deny'd to follow my departed lord, Whene'er his duty calls him to the palace? CHORUS. Covet not that; the noblest proof of love That Athelwold can give, is still to guard Your beauties from the blast of courtly gales. The crimson blush of virgin modesty, The delicate soft tints of innocence There all fly off, and leave no boast behind But well-rang'd, faded features. Ah, Elfrida, Should you be doom'd, which happier fate forbid! To drag your hours through all that nauseous scene Of pageantry and vice! your purer breast, True to its virtuous relish, soon would heave A fervent sigh for innocence and Harewood. ELFRIDA. You much mistake me, Virgins; the throng'd palace Were undesir'd by me, did not that palace Detain my Athelwold. If he were here, His presence would convert this range of oaks To stately columns; these gay-liv'ried flow'rs To troops of gallant ladies; and yon deer, That jut their antlers forth in sportive fray, To armed knights at joust or tournament. If Athelwold dwelt here; if no ambition Could lure his steps from love, and this still forest; If I might never moan his time of absence, Longer than that which serv'd him for the chase Or of the wolf, or stag; or when he bore The hood-wink'd falcon forth; might these, my Virgins, And these alone, be love's short intervals, I should not have one thought remote from Harewood. CHORUS. And would you wish that Athelwold should slight The weal of England, and on these light toys Waste his unvalued hours? No, fond Elfrida; His active soul is wing'd for nobler flights. ELFRIDA. What then, must England's welfare hold my Earl For ever from these shades? CHORUS. We say not that. The youth, who bathes in pleasure's tempting stream At well judg'd intervals, feels all his soul Nerv'd with recruited strength; but if too oft He swims in sportive mazes through the flood, It chills his languid virtue. For this cause Your Earl forbids, that these enchanting groves, And their fair mistress should possess him wholly. He knows he has a country and a king, That claim his first attention; yet be sure, 'Twill not be long, ere his unbending mind Shall lose in sweet oblivion ev'ry care, Among th' embow'ring shades that veil Elfrida. ELFRIDA. Oh be that speech prophetic; may he soon Seek these embow'ring shades! Meanwhile, my friends, Sooth me with harmony. I know full well That ye were nurs'd in Cornwall's wizard caves, And oft have pac'd the fairy-peopled vales Of Devon, where posterity retains Some vein of that old minstrelsy, which breath'd Through each time-honour'd grove of British oak. There, where the spreading consecrated boughs Fed the sage misletoe, the holy Druids Lay rapt in moral musings; while the Bards Call'd from their solemn harps such lofty airs, As drew down Fancy from the realms of light To paint some radiant vision on their minds, Of high mysterious import. But on me Such strains sublime were wasted: I but ask A sprightly song to speed the lazy flight Of these dull hours. And music sure can find A magic spell to make them skim their round, Swift as the swallow circles. Try its power: While I, from yonder hillock, watch his coming. [Exit Elfrida. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. The turtle tells her plaintive tale, Sequester'd in some shadowy vale; The lark in radiant ether floats, And swells his wild extatic notes: Meanwhile on yonder hawthorn spray The linnet wakes her temp'rate lay; She haunts no solitary shade, She flutters o'er no sun-shine mead, No love-lorn griefs depress her song, No raptures lift it loudly high, But soft she trills, amid th' aerial throng, Smooth simple strains of sob'rest harmony. I. 2. Sweet bird! like thine our lay shall flow, Nor gaily brisk, nor sadly slow; For to thy note sedate, and clear, Content still lends a list'ning ear. Reclin'd this mossy bank along, Oft has she heard thy careless song: Why hears not now? What fairer grove From Harewood lures her devious love? What fairer grove than Harewood knows More woodland walks, more fragrant gales, More shadowy bowers, inviting soft repose, More streams slow-wand'ring thro' her winding vales? I. 3. Perhaps to some lone cave the rover flies, Where lull'd in pious peace the hermit lies. For, from the hall's tumultuous state, Where banners wave with blazon'd gold, There will the meek-ey'd matron oft retreat, And with the solemn sage high converse hold. II. 1. There, goddess, on the shaggy mound, Where tumbling torrents roar around, Where pendant mountains o'er your head Stretch their reverential shade, You listen, while the holy Seer Slowly chants his vespers clear; Or of his sparing mess partake, The sav'ry pulse, the wheaten cake, The bev'rage cool of limpid rill. Then, rising light, your host you bless, And o'er his saintly temples bland distil Seraphic day-dreams of heav'n's happiness. II. 2. Where'er thou art, enchanting Power, Thou soon wilt smile in Harewood's bower: Soon will thy fairy feet be seen, Printing this dew-impearled green; Soon shall we mark thy gestures meek, Thy glitt'ring eye and dimpled cheek, Among the welcome guests that move Attendant on the state of Love. There, when the Sov'reign leads along Of sports and smiles a jocund train, Then last but loveliest of the lovely throng, Thou com'st to soften, yet secure his reign. II. 3. And, hark, completing our prophetic lay, The fleet hoof rattles o'er the flinty way; Now nearer, and now nearer sounds. Avaunt! ye vain, delusive fears. Hark! Echo tells through Harewood's amplest bounds, That Love, Content, and Athelwold appears. ATHELWOLD, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Look ever thus; with that bright glance of joy Thus always meet my transports. Let these arms Thus ever fold me; and this cheek, that blooms With all health's op'ning roses, press my lips, Warm as at this blest moment. ELFRIDA. Athelwold, I had prepar'd me many a stern rebuke; Had arm'd my brow with frowns, and taught my eye Th' averted glance of coldness, which might best Greet such a loit'ring lover: but I find, 'Twas a vain task; for this my truant heart Forgets each lesson, which resentment taught, And in thy sight knows only to be happy. ATHELWOLD. My best ElfridaâHeav'ns! it cannot last. The giddy height of joy, to which I'm lifted, Is as a hanging rock, at whose low foot The black and beating surge of infamy Rolls ready to receive, and sink my soul. ELFRIDA. So soon to fall into this musing moodâ I thought, my Lord, you promis'd you would leave These looks behind at Court. Nay, 'twas the cause Assign'd for this my residence at Harewood, That you might never come to these fond arms, But with a breast devoid of public care, And fill'd alone with rapture and Elfrida. Said you not so? Why then that pensive posture, That down-cast eye? Surely the City's din, And this calm grove have lost their difference. I'll with you to the palace. ATHELWOLD. Heav'n forbid! ELFRIDA. Nay, my best Lord, I meant it but in sport; For should you bid me quit these blooming lawns, For some bare heath, or drear unpeopled desert; Believe me, I would think its wildness Eden, If Athelwold with frequent visitation Endear'd the savage scene; but yet I fear My Father. ATHELWOLD. Hah! why him? ELFRIDA. You know his temper; How jealous of his rank, and his trac'd lineage From royal ancestry. I fear me much, He will not brook you should conceal me long In this lone privacy: No, he will deem it Far unbecoming her, whose veins are fill'd With the rich stream of his nobility. Should it be so, his hot and fiery nature, I doubt, will blaze, and do some dreadful outrage. ATHELWOLD. He need not know it, or, if chance he should, It matters not, if so this forest life Seem of your own adoption and free choice. And that it will so seem, I trust that love, Which ever yet has met my wayward will With pleas'd compliance, and unask'd assent. ELFRIDA. And ever shall: yet blame me not, my Lord, If prying womanhood should prompt a wish To learn the cause of this your strange commotion, Which ever wakes, if I but drop one thought Of quitting Harewood. ATHELWOLD. Go to the clear surface Of yon unruffled lake, and, bending o'er it, There read my answer. ELFRIDA. These are riddles, Sirâ ATHELWOLD. No; for its glassy and reflecting surface Will smile with charms too tempting for a palace. ELFRIDA. Does Athelwold distrust Elfrida's faith? ATHELWOLD. No; but he much distrusts Elfrida's beauty. ELFRIDA. Away: you trifle. ATHELWOLD. Never more in earnest; I would not for the throne which Edgar sits on, That Edgar should behold it. ELFRIDA. What, my Lord! Think you the form, that caught your single heart, Will make all hearts its captives? Vain surmize. Yet grant it could? the form is your's alone: Not Edgar's self would dare to seize it from you. Edgar's a King, and not a tyrant. ATHELWOLD. True; Edgar's a King, a just one; his firm feet Walk ever in the fore-right road of honour: Nor do I know what lure can draw his steps Devious from that straight path, save only one: That tempting lure is beauty. Ah! Elfrida, Throw but the dazzling bait within his view, The untam'd wolf does not with fiercer rage Burst the slight bondage of the silken net, Than he the ties of law. Late, very late, Smit casually with young Matilda's face, He straight commanded her reluctant Mother To yield her to his arms; nor had she 'scap'd The violating fervour of his love, Had not the prudent dame suborn'd her handmaid To take the unchaste office, and be led, Veil'd in the mask of night, to Edgar's chamber, A counterfeit Matilda. As it chanc'd, The damsel pleas'd the King, nor did detection A whit abate his fondness; he forgave The prudent mother, eas'd Matilda's fears, And led the wanton minstrel to his court, Where still she sharesâ CHORUS. Behold, Earl Athelwold, A messenger arrives; his speed and aspect Speak some important errand. EDWIN, ATHELWOLD, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. How now, Edwin? EDWIN. The King, my Lord, is on his way to Harewood. ATHELWOLD. The King! EDWIN. His purpose is to pass through Mercia: And in a hasty message, some two hours After you left the palace, this his pleasure Was sent you by Lord Seofrid: withal Commanding your attendance. You being absent, He straightway turn'd his course through this fair forest, Meaning to chace the Stag; his train is small, As was his purpose sudden. ELFRIDA. Good my Lord, Why thus perplex'd! CHORUS. Heav'ns! what a deep despair Sits on his brow! ELFRIDA. The notice sure is short; But that's a trifle, a small train requires The smaller preparation: let him come. ATHELWOLD. Yes, let him come: so thou wilt say, Elfrida, When thou hast heard my tale. Yes, let him come; So wilt thou say, and let thy husband perish. Yet shall these arms once more embrace thee closely, Ere yet thou fly them as the pois'nous adder. 'Tis o'er: in that embrace Elfrida's love Was buried; and in that embrace, the peace Of wretched Athelwold. ELFRIDA. What may this be! ATHELWOLD. Oh Edwin, Edwin, when surviving malice Shall prey upon the fame of thy dead master, Wilt thou not some way strive to check the fiend's Insatiate fury? wilt thou see my name Defil'd and blacken'd with detraction's venom, And bear it patiently? ELFRIDA. What means my bestâ ATHELWOLD. Peace; not a word of best, or lov'd, or dear: Such tender terms are not for thee to use, Or me to triumph in. Virgins, retire; We would a while be private. Nay, return. Concealment would be vain; and ye and Edwin Are bound to me. Albina! as for you, I sav'd your father, when his blood was forfeit. CHORUS. Not I, great Earl, alone, but all this train Are bound by ev'ry tie of faith and love To gen'rous Athelwold; to that mild master, Who never forc'd our service to one act, But of such liberal sort, as freedom's self Would smilingly perform. ATHELWOLD. It may be so; But where's the tie, Elfrida, that may bind Thy faith and love? ELFRIDA. The strongest sure, my Lord, The golden, nuptial tie. Try but its strength. ATHELWOLD. I must perforce this instant. Know, Elfrida, Once, on a day of high festivity, The youthful King, encircled with his Nobles, Crown'd high the sparkling bowl; and much of love, Of beauty much the sprightly converse ran. When, as it well might chance, the brisk Lord Ardulph Made gallant note of Orgar's peerless daughter, And in such phrase as might enflame a breast More cool than Edgar's. Early on the morrow Th' impatient Monarch gave me swift commission To view those charms, of which Lord Ardulph's tongue Had giv'n such warm description: to whose words If my impartial eye gave full assent, I had his royal mandate on the instant To hail thee Queen of England. ELFRIDA, 'Stead of which, You came, and hail'd me wife of Athelwold. Was this the tale I was so taught to fear? Was this the deed, that known would make me fly Thy clasping arm, as 'twere the pois'nous adder; See, I again embrace thee; dearest proof That thy Elfrida's love can never die; Or, if it could, that this embrace revives it. ATHELWOLD. Dost thou then pardon me? Come, injur'd sov'reign, Plunge deep thy sword of justice in this breast, And I will die contented. ELFRIDA. Heav'n forbid! What can be done? CHORUS. Indeed, ye constant pair, 'Tis fit ye strive to fly the coming danger: For safety now sits wav'ring on your love, Like the light down upon the thistle's beard, Which ev'ry breeze may part. Say, noble Earl, What feint was us'd to lull the king's impatience? ATHELWOLD. Soon as these shades had veil'd my beauteous bride I hasted back to Edgar, laugh'd at Ardulph, And talk'd of Elfrid, as of vulgar beauties; Own'd no uncommon light'ning in her eye, No breast that sham'd the snow, or cheek the rose, The sprightly King believ'd me, and forgot her. CHORUS. But an alliance, great as Athelwold's With Orgar's daughter, soon would blaze abroad, The theme of popular converse. ATHELWOLD. True, it would, And for that reason, when I last was here, The King was taught I went to wed Elfrida. ELFRIDA. How so, my lord? ATHELWOLD. Thy father, my Elfrida, Has rich possessions: these, and these alone, I made my theme of love: and told the king, That though thy face (pardon the impious falshood) Boasted not charms to grace a Monarch's throne, Yet would thy dow'r well suit his minister. I therefore meant to ask thee of thy father, And (that my want of skill in choice might 'scape All censure) hide thee close in Harewood castle. Edgar with smiles consented, and, I think, Harbours no thought of my disloyalty. ELFRIDA. If so, what danger now? ATHELWOLD. Ask'st thou, what danger? Heav'ns! will that glance not instantly proclaim My tenfold perfidy? ELFRIDA. He shall not see me. I'll hide me instant in some secret chamber, And robe this virgin in my bridal vestments. ATHELWOLD. Thy love, like balm, runs trickling o'er the wounds Of my torn bosom; yet 'tis vain, 'tis vain: Thou must thyself appear, for Ardulph ever Attends the King, and would detect the fraud. ELFRIDA. If so, yet still I can assure our safety; For as you fear my softness of complexion, I'll stain it with the juice of dusky leaves, Or yellow berries, which this various wood From tree or shrub will yield me. These I'll use, And form a thousand methods to conceal The little gleams of grace, which Nature lent me. Fear not my caution. ATHELWOLD. Gentlest, best of creatures, Go, do then as thy tender care directs. And yet how vain! What wond'rous art can steal The liquid lightnings from those radiant eyes, Or rob the wavy ringlets of that hair Of all their nameless graces? Say it could, Yet would that modest, but majestic mien, That inborn dignity of soul, which breathes Through each angelic gesture, still remain To seize the heart of Edgar. Rest, Elfrida, Rest as thou art, in all that blaze of beauty: I must submit to my just lot, and lose thee. ELFRIDA. Away, my Lord, with these too anxious scruples: Fear not my carriage; I will stoop my head, Drawl out an idiot phrase, and do each act With ev'n a rude and peasant awkwardness. EDWIN. Ere this, my Lord, I think, the King has reach'd The full mid-way; 'twere fit you stood prepar'd To give him meeting. ATHELWOLD. Give him meeting, Edwin! Alas! I have no mask to veil my baseness. When deep contrition shadows all my soul, I cannot dress my features in light smiles, And look the thing I am not. No, these eyes Are not as yet true vassals to my purpose; As yet indeed I am but half a villain. ELFRIDA. You weigh this matter in too nice a balance. Your crime, my Lord, is but the crime of love: Thousands like you have fail'd. ATHELWOLD. I know, Elfrida, Could love absolve the crime, my soul were pure As maiden innocence. Yes, I do love thee, And thou art fairâbeyondâBut that's my bane; Thy ev'ry charm adds weight to my offence, And heaps fresh wrongs upon the best of masters. Yes, Elfrid, Edgar was the best of masters. Oh hide me from the thought in that dear bosomâ Heav'ns! I must die or keep her. ELFRIDA. Live, or die, I'm thine alike. Death cannot aught abate, Or life augment, my love. Let this embrace Be witness of my truth. ATHELWOLD. It shall, it shall: Thy ev'ry word and look declares thee faithful: Secure of all thy love, and all thy prudence, Returning confidence has arm'd my soul For this dread meeting: resting on thy truth I goâ [Exit Athelwold. ELFRIDA. Go, and thy guardian saint preserve thee, Show'r blessings vast as would my lavish love, Had I his power to bless thee! CHORUS. Yes, my Sisters, The silent awe that reigns through all your train, Befits ye well. Let admiration first Pay her mute tribute. She can best express, By those her kindling cheeks, and lifted eyes Where the tear twinkles, that transcendent praise Elfrida's virtue claims. ELFRIDA. My virtue, Virgins, Is only love. Or, say that it be virtue, It owes its source to love, to chastest love, Than which what passion more impels the mind To fair and gen'rous action? But the hours Are precious now. I'll to yon neighb'ring grove: There grows an azure flow'r, I oft have mark'd it, Which stains the pressing finger with a juice Of dusky, yellow tinct: Its name I know not, I'll fetch and try it straight. Wait my return. [Exit Elfrida. CHORUS. ODE. I. Whence does this sudden lustre rise, That gilds the grove? Not like the noontide beam, Which sparkling dances on the trembling stream, Nor the blue lightning's flash swift-shooting thro' the skies. But such a solemn steady light, As o'er the cloudless azure steals, When Cynthia, riding on the brow of night, Stops in their mid career her silver wheels. II. Whence can it rise, but from the sober power Of Constancy? She, heav'n-born queen, Descends, and here in Harewood's hallow'd bower, Fixes her stedfast reign: Stedfast, as when her high command Gives to the starry band Their radiant stations in heav'n's ample plain. Stedfast, as when around this nether sphere, She winds the various year; Tells what time the snow-drop cold Its maiden whiteness may unfold, When the golden harvest bend, When the ruddy fruits descend. Then bids pale Winter wake, to pour The pearly hail's translucent show'r, To cast his silv'ry mantle o'er the woods, And bind in crystal chains the slumb'ring floods. III. The soul, which she inspires, has pow'r to climb To all the heights sublime Of Virtue's tow'ring hill. That hill, at whose low foot weak-warbling strays The scanty stream of human praise, A shallow trickling rill. While on the summits hov'ring angels shed, From their blest pinions, the nectareous dews Of rich immortal fame: From these the Muse Oft steals some precious drops, and skilful blends With those the lower fountain lends; Then show'rs it all on some high-favour'd head. But thou, Elfrida, claim'st the genuine dew; Thy worth demands it all, Pure, and unmixt, on thee the holy drops shall fall. [Elfrida returns with flowers. ELFRIDA, ORGAR, CHORUS. ELFRIDA (looking on the flower). 'Tis strange, my Virgins, this sweet child of summer, Silken and soft, whose breath perfumes the air, Whose gay vest paints the morn, should in its bosom Hide such pollution? Yet 'tis often thus: All are not as they seem. ORGAR. Yet hear me, Lady. ELFRIDA. Be gone, unmanner'd stranger, nor pursue me; Hence, from the grove. Know ye this Pilgrim, Virgins? On my return I met him here. CHORUS. Alas! We saw him here before, and heard his tale, That mov'd our pityâBut I fear me now, 'Twas false; some spy, perchance, and may have heardâ ORGAR. I have; yet not for that are you betray'd. Fair excellence, my heart is bound unto you, I feel a tender interest in your welfare, Tender as fathers feel. ELFRIDA. As fathers feel! That well known voice, and ah! that lookâ ORGAR. Elfrida! ELFRIDA. Yes, it is he, it is my Father: Virgins, Support me, or I faint! Oh, wherefore, Sir? ORGAR. Take courage, Daughter; my parental fondness Prompted this visit. Thus I came disguis'd, To learn the cause of my dear child's confinement: And I have learnt it. ELFRIDA. Then all's lost for ever. ORGAR. Thou know'st, Elfrida, next my house's honour, Thy peace has ever been my dearest care. But such an insultâNo: I cannot brook it. So black a fraud! By all my ancestors, By Belin's shade I will have ample vengeance. ELFRIDA. Alas! I know too well your dreadful purpose. I knew it at the first. Yes, he must fall. Yet pardon me, if my poor trembling heart Puts up I know not what of pray'rs and vows To ev'ry pitying saint. Celestial Guardians Of nuptial constancy! Oh bend from heav'n Your star-crown'd heads, and hear a wretched woman, That begs ye save, from a dread father's rage, Her lord, her husband. ORGAR. Husband! Sooner call Th' impeached thief true master of the booty He stole, or murder'd for. Disdain the villain; And help me to revenge thee. CHORUS. Think, great Earl; What sanctimonious ties restrain your daughter. Did she not swear before the hallow'd shrine Eternal fealty to this her lord? Yet say, that he deceiv'd her; shall her truth Dare to revenge? No, Sir, in highest heav'n Vengeance in storms and tempests sits enshrin'd, Vested in robes of lightning, and there sleeps, Unwak'd but by the incens'd Almighty's call. Oh! let not man presume to take unbid That dread vicegerency. ORGAR. Peace, Virgins, peace. Not ev'n the saws of Druids or of Bards Have weight with me, when insults high as this Rouse my just indignation. Hear me, Daughter; You went to search for flow'rs, to blot your charms With their dun hue. Yes, thou shalt search for flow'rs, Yet shall they be the loveliest of the spring; Flow'rs, that entangling in thine auburn hair, Or blushing 'mid the whiteness of thy bosom, May, to the power of ev'ry native grace, Give double life and lustre. Haste, my child, Array thyself in thy most gorgeous garb, And see each jewel, which my love procur'd thee, Dart its full radiance. More than all, put on The nobler ornament of winning smiles, And kind inviting glances. ELFRIDA. Never, never; When this true heart renounces Athelwold, May equitable Heav'nâ ORGAR. Away with vows; And with a duteous, and attentive ear, Listen to my persuasions. Much I wish Persuasions might prevail, that not compell'd To use a father's just prerogative, My will may meet with thy unforc'd obedience. Follow me, on thy duty. ELFRIDA. Cruel Father, That duty shall obey you; I will follow: Yet dread as is that frown, dreadful as death, It shall not shake the tenor of my faith; Living or dead I still am Athelwold's. [Exeunt Orgar and Elfrida. SEMICHORUS. Horror! Horror! The pen of fate, dipt in its deepest gall, Perhaps on that ill-omen'd wall, Now writes th' event of this tremendous day. Oh! that our weaker sight Could read the mystic characters, and spy What to the unpurg'd, mortal eye, Is hid in endless night. SEMICHORUS. Suspense! thou frozen guest, begone. The wretch, whose rugged bed Is spread on thorns, more softly rests his head, Than he that sinks amid the cygnet's down, If thou, tormenting fiend, be nigh, To prompt his starting tear, his ceaseless sigh, His wish, his pray'r, his vow for ling'ring certainty. CHORUS. But hark! that certainty arrives. Methought I heard the winding horn. I did not err; The King is near at hand. This quick approach Will sure prevent this proud Earl's cruel purpose. Yet what of that? Does her fair form require The blazon of rich vesture? Genuine beauty Nor asks, nor needs it: Negligence alone Is its bright diadem, and artless ease Its robe of Tyrian tincture. Say, my Sisters, Shall we salute this monarch with a hymn Of festival and joy? Alas! such joy Ill suits our trembling hearts, and weeping eyes. And now 'twere vain; for see, the King approaches. EDGAR, ATHELWOLD, CHORUS. EDGAR. No, Athelwold; not from a partial blindness, Or for the mode and guise of courtesy, Are we thus large in praise; in our true judgment, This castle is not more kind Nature's debtor For its delicious site, than 'tis to thee For this so goodly structure. From its base, Ev'n to yon turrets trim, and taper spires, All is of choicest masonry. Each part Doth boast a separate grace, yet each combines To form one graceful whole; for ornament, Though here the richest that the eye can note, Is us'd, not lavish'd; Art seems generous here, Yet not a prodigal. But ah! my Earl, [Seeing the Chorus. What living charms are here? Thy castle's beauty Must not detain me from this lovelier prospect. Your pardon, fair ones, that my wayward eye Paid not at first, where first was surely due, Its homage to your graces. ATHELWOLD. Heav'ns! they weep. What may this mean? Some dread and unseen chance Has counter-work'd my safety. EDGAR. Whence this silence? Why are your lovely heads thus bow'd with sadness? Beshrew my heart, my Lord, but this is strange. I know thee, Earl, and know thy gentleness, More prone t' obey, than lord it o'er the sex; Else should I guess this sorrow had its rise From some discourteous treatment. CHORUS. No, dread Sov'reign; He is the noblest, gentlest, best of masters; And may your love rewardâ ORGAR, ATHELWOLD, EDGAR, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Death to my hopes! ORGAR. Yes, Villain, start; but let this vengeful arm Arrest thy baseness: would to Heav'n its strength, Thus grasping thee, could open thy false breast, And bare thy heart to the sham'd eye of day. EDGAR. Patience, hot man. What art thou? ORGAR. Earl of Devon. Pardon me, Prince; that this my honest rage O'erleaps obedient duty. I am wrong'd, Yet that's but small; for know, much-injur'd Prince, Thy wrongs as well as mine both call for justice. Yes, Sir, I here, on a true subject's oath, Proclaim Earl Athelwold a faithless traitor. EDGAR. Ha! what is this? Renounce the word, old Earl; Thy length of years hath forc'd thee, sure, to press The verge of dotage. Athelwold! what, Athelwold A faithless traitor! Perish the suspicion. Never before did word, or thought, or look Give doubt of his distinguish'd loyalty: Dotage alone could frame the accusation. ORGAR. I do not dote; thank Heav'n, my faculties Are yet my own, unblemish'd and unhurt. Would so my Daughter were! EDGAR. What is his drift? ATHELWOLD. Better, my royal Lord, you mark'd him not; The wayward Earl isâ ORGAR. What, audacious Villain! I will be heard. EDGAR, Go to, thou choleric Lord! ORGAR. When thou hast heard me, Edgar, call me choleric. EDGAR. Speak then, and briefly. ORGAR. Once, my sacred Liege, I had a daughter, duteous as e'er crown'd A father's wish, and lovely as could warm A youth to am'rous transports. This, my Lord, You learnt long since from noble Ardulph's praises. And, fir'd with his description, sent this Earl, This faithful Earl, t'invite her to your throne. EDGAR. No, Orgar, not t'invite her to our throne; Simply to note her beauty was his errand. ORGAR. Yes, he did note it, stampt it for his own. But why this parley? Enter, Sir, these gates, And let Elfrida's features be the book, Where you may read the story of his falshood, Ev'n on the instant. EDGAR. Noble Lord, lead on: We'll follow to the trial. I will humour The Earl's hot temper. He has heard my friend, We meant t'exalt his daughter, and for that His partial fondness, link'd with his ambition, Levels this rage at thee. Attend us, Lords. [Exeunt Edgar, Orgar, &amp;c. CHORUS, ATHELWOLD. CHORUS. My Lord, the King is enter'd: stand not thus In mute and fixt distress. ATHELWOLD. Away, away; What! can a man that thinks such thoughts as I do Have pow'r of word or motion? speak to me; Inform me all. What said she, when I left her? How came her Father hither? how did she Greet his arrival? say, was she compell'd, Or did her free and voluntary voice Tell all the story? Did she marshal him To this his deed of vengeance; CHORUS. Dearest Master; Elfrida told him not: his own deceit Was his informer. Here the Earl arriv'd Early at morn, in mean and pilgrim weeds, All like an ancient, toil-worn traveller; And with a tale, told in such piteous strain, Fraught with such sad and moving circumstance, With woes so well dissembled, that our softness Suffer'd him enter this close bow'r for rest, Which he adapting to his prying purpose, Thence learnt the secret. This our disobedience, We ownâ ATHELWOLD. Was my perdition. Yet 'tis well; I blame ye not; it was Heav'n's justice, Virgins; This brought him hither; this annull'd your faith. I do not think, you purpos'd my destruction; But yet you have destroy'd me. Oh Elfrida, And art thou faithful? This my jealous eye Thought it had mark'd some speck of change upon thee; Thought it had found, what might have made thy loss Somewhat within endurance. 'Tis not so; And this thy purity but serves t' augment The sum of my distractions. Meet me, Edgar, With thy rais'd sword: be merciful and suddenâ [Exit Athelwold. CHORUS. ODE. I. 1. Say, will no white-rob'd Son of Light, Swift-darting from his heav'nly height, Here deign to take his hallow'd stand; Here wave his amber locks; unfold His pinions cloth'd with downy gold; Here smiling stretch his tutelary wand? And you, ye host of Saints, for ye have known Each dreary path in life's perplexing maze, Though now ye circle yon eternal throne With harpings high of inexpressive praise, Will not your train descend in radiant state, To break with Mercy's beam this gath'ring cloud of Fate? I. 2. 'Tis silence all. No Son of Light Darts swiftly from his heav'nly height; No train of radiant Saints descend. âMortals, in vain ye hope to find, âIf guilt, if fraud has stain'd your mind, âOr Saint to hear, or Angel to defend.â So Truth proclaims. I hear the sacred sound Burst from the centre of her burning throne; Where aye she sits with star-wreath'd lustre crown'd: A bright sun clasps her adamantine zone. So Truth proclaims: her awful voice I hear: With many a solemn pause it slowly meets my ear. I. 3. âAttend, ye sons of men; attend, and say, âDoes not enough of my refulgent ray âBreak through the veil of your mortality! âSay, does not reason in this form descry âUnnumber'd, nameless glories, that surpass âThe Angel's floating pomp, the Seraph's glowing grace? II. 1. âShall then your earth-born daughters vie âWith me? Shall she, whose brightest eye âBut emulates the diamond's blaze, âWhose cheek but mocks the peaches' bloom, âWhose breath the hyacinth's perfume, âWhose melting voice the warbling woodlark's lays, âShall she be deem'd my rival? Shall a form âOf elemental dross, of mould'ring clay, âVie with these charms imperial? The poor worm âShall prove her contest vain. Life's little day âShall pass, and she is gone: while I appear âFlush'd with the bloom of youth thro' Heav'n's eternal year. II. 2. âKnow, Mortals, know, ere first ye sprung, âEre first these orbs in ether hung, âI shone amid the heav'nly throng. âThese eyes beheld Creation's day, âThis voice began the choral lay, âAnd taught Archangels their triumphant song. âPleas'd I survey'd bright Nature's gradual birth, âSaw infant Light with kindling lustre spread, âSoft vernal fragrance clothe the flow'ring earth, âAnd Ocean heave on his extended bed; âSaw the tall pine aspiring pierce the sky, âThe tawny lion stalk, the rapid eagle fly. II. 3. âLast, Man arose, erect in youthful grace, âHeav'n's hallow'd image stampt upon his face, âAnd, as he rose, the high behest was giv'n, âThat I alone, of all the host of heav'n, âShould reign Protectress of the godlike youth. âThus the Almighty spake: he spake, and call'd me Truth.â ATHELWOLD, EDWIN, CHORUS. ATHELWOLD. Banish me! No. I'll die. For why should life Remain a lonely lodger in that breast Which honour leaves deserted? Idle breath, Thou can'st not fill such vacancy. Begone. This sword shall freeâ CHORUS. Oh shame to Fortitude! Shame to that manly passion, which inspires Its vigorous warmth, when the bleak blasts of Fate Would chill the soul. Oh call the ready virtue Quick to thy aid, for she is ever near thee; Is ever prompt to spread her sevenfold shield O'er noble breasts. ATHELWOLD. And but o'er noble breasts; Not o'er the breast which livid infamy Indelibly has spotted. Oh shame, shame! Sword, rid me of the thought. CHORUS. Forbear, forbear; Think what a sea of deep perdition whelms The wretch's trembling soul, who launches forth Unlicens'd to eternity. Think, think; And let the thought restrain thy impious hand. The race of man is one vast marshall'd army, Summon'd to pass the spacious realms of time; Their leader the Almighty. In that march Ah who may quit his post, when high in air The chos'n Archangel rides, whose right hand wields Th' imperial standard of Heav'n's providence, Which, dreadly sweeping through the vaulted sky, O'ershadows all creation? ATHELWOLD. I was onceâ Yes, I was once (I have his royal word for 't) A man of such try'd faith, such steady honour, As mock'd all doubt and scruple.âWhat a change! Now must that unstain'd, virgin character, Be doom'd to gross and hourly prostitution, Sating the lust of slander; and my wife, My chaste ElfridaâOh distraction! no, I'll fly to save her. EDWIN. Stay, my dearest Master; You rush on instant death. ATHELWOLD. I mean it, Slave, And would'st thou hinder me? EDWIN. Yes, Sir, I hold 'Tis duty to my King, and love to you, Thus to oppose your entrance. ATHELWOLD. What, thou Traitor! Thy pardon, Edwin, I forgot myself; Forgot, that I stood here a banish'd man; And that this gate was shut against its master. And yet this gate leads to my dear Elfrida; Can it be barr'd to me? Oh earth, cold earth, Upon whose breast I cast this load of mis'ry, Bear it a while; and you, ye aged oaks, Ye venerable fathers of this wood, Who oft have cool'd beneath your arching shades My humble ancestors, oft seen them hie To your spread umbrage, from yon sultry field, Their scene of honest labour, shade, ah! shade The last, the wretchedest of all their race. I will not long pollute ye; for I mean To pay beneath your consecrated gloom A sacrifice to honour, and the ghosts Of those progenitors, who sternly frown On me their base descendant. EDWIN. See, ye Virgins, How horror shades his brow; how fixt his eye; Heav'ns! what despairâ CHORUS. Edwin, 'tis ever thus With noble minds, if chance they slide to folly; Remorse stings deeper, and relentless conscience Pours more of gall into the bitter cup Of their severe repentance. ATHELWOLD. 'Tis resolved; I'll enter and demand a second audience. And yet how vain! ere I can reach his ear, His ready train will stop me, and, with all The cruel punctuality of office, So prompt to act against fall'n favourites, Dismiss me with reproof.âSurely I heard her. Was't not Elfrida's voice? 'Tis she herself. ELFRIDA, EDGAR, ATHELWOLD, ORGAR, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. No, I will once more clasp him to my bosom, I will not be withheld, I will o'ertake him, Will go with him to exile. Hah, my Husband! So quickly found? they thought to tear me from thee; But we will part no more. EDGAR. Take heed, Elfrida. This ill-tim'd fondness may recall the fate I just now freed him from; who loves like me Can ill brook this. Or quit him, or he dies. ATHELWOLD. Yes, let me die! death is my dearest wish. Quit me, Elfrida! leave me to my fate. 'Tis just, 'tis just. Thus to my Sov'reign's sword Freely I bare my breast. Strike, injur'd Prince; But do not banish me. ELFRIDA. What, Athelwold, Is then the life, on whose dear preservation Elfrida's peace depends, not worth the saving! Die then. But ere thy murd'rer strike the stroke, Let me inform him, that his act destroys No single life. EDGAR. By Heav'n, she loves the traitor Beyond all hope of changeâ ELFRIDA. No, Athelwold, Thou shalt not die: That pause in royal Edgar Bespeaks forgiveness. He will soon relent; And mercy, flowing from his gracious tongue, Seal thy full pardon. Let us kneel, my Lord; Seize the important moment; kneel together, And as these streaming eyes and lifted hands Employ each act of silent supplication, Do thou recountâAh! no, thy modest tongue Could never tell ev'n half the gallant story. Be silent then. Let Edgar's self reflect; For well I know his mem'ry writes thy virtues Upon its fairest page. Yes, let him weigh All thy past deeds of loyalty and faith, 'Gainst this so light a fault. EDGAR. So light a fault! Had he dislodg'd my richest coffer'd treasures, Dispers'd sedition's poison 'mid my troops, Or aim'd with daring and rebellious hand To snatch these regal honours from my brow, I sooner could have pardon'd. ATHELWOLD. Cease, Elfrida, My doom is justâYes, royal Sir, I go To banishment. I do deserve to breathe, Deserve to bear this load of life about me, For many years; to lengthen out my age, List'ning the hourly knell of curst Remembrance, Whose leaden stroke shall tell to my sad soul That I was faithful once. ELFRIDA. Oh flinty Edgar, What! will this penitence not move thee? Know There is a rose-lip'd Seraph sits on high, Who ever bends his holy ear to earth To mark the voice of Penitence, to catch Her solemn sighs, to tune them to his harp, And echo them in harmonies divine Up to the throne of Grace. Ev'n Heav'n is won By penitence, and shall Heav'n's substitute, Shall Edgar scornâ EDGAR. Cease, cease, thou beauteous pleader, Ah! far too beauteous! Would'st thou gain thy suit, Why glows that vermeil lip; why rolls that eye Bright as the ray of morn? why in each gesture Such inexpressive graces, but because They're native all, and will not be conceal'd? Else sure each charm betrays him, and becomes An advocate, whose silent eloquence Pleads 'gainst thy voice, and foils its tuneful power. Traitor! was this the face which thy false tongue Profan'd as vulgar? This such common beauty As the fair eye of Day beheld each hour In ev'ry clime he lighted? Base Dissembler, This instant quit our realm. ELFRIDA. Oh stay thee, Edgar, And once more hear me. At thy feet I fall As earnest, and distrest a supplicant, As e'er embrac'd the knees of Majesty. Oh! spare thy Country's guardian, Edgar, spare Thy closest, surest friend. Let not one fault Cancel his thousand, thousand acts of faith. Alas! I fall to vainest repetition. Grief, whelming grief drowns all my faculties, And leaves me nought but tears EDGAR. Rise, rise, Elfrida. ELFRIDA. Shall he then live? EDGAR. He shall, he shall, my Fair, If so he quit the realm within the space Our sentence limited. ELFRIDA, Oh stop not there; That sentence will be death to Athelwold. Think, for thou know'st full well his gentle nature, Can he support the rigour of this doom? Can he, who liv'd but in thy gracious smiles, Who'd pine, if chance those smiles a single hour Were dealt him thriftily; think, can he bear The infamy of exile? EDGAR. Hear me, Athelwold. Did I not show'r on thy much-favour'd head My thickest honours, and with gift so ready As out-run all request? Did I not hold thee Still in such open confidence of friendship, Such love asâ ATHELWOLD. Sooner stab me than repeat it. EDGAR. Yet give me hearing. I repeat not this To taunt or gall thee: On my soul thy worth Did o'ertop all those honours, and thy zeal Kept pace with my best love. Nor 'till this deedâ But such a deed! look there, look on that face. Thou know'st me, Athelwold, hast seen me gaze On a soft yielding fair one, 'till mine eye Shot flames. Perdition seize me, if this heart Knew love 'till now. ATHELWOLD. I see it plain, my Liege, Nor say I aught to lessen my offence. No, here I kneel, Oh! cast but on my mis'ry One kind forgiving glance; this ready sword Shall expiate all. ELFRIDA. Ah! will you? must he die? EDGAR. No, stay thee, Athelwold, and sheath thy sword; I never yet (save but this hour of rage) Deem'd thee my subject: Thou wert still my friend; And injur'd as I am, thou still art such. I do forego the word; to banish thee, Or seal thy death, transcends a friend's just right. ELFRIDA. Ah gen'rous deed! ah godlike goodness! Virgins, The King will pardon him. 'Wake each high note Of praise, and gratitude, teach Edgar's name To Harewood's farthest echo. Oh, my Sov'reign! What words can speak my thanksâ EDGAR. Nay, check these transports, Lest, if I see thee thus, my soul forget Its milder purpose. I will leave thee, Lady; Yet first my lips must press this gentle hand, And breathe one soft sigh of no common fervour. Now on, my LordsâFair wonder of thy sex, Adieu. We'll straight unto our realm of Mercia. Yet first, as was our purpose, through this forest We'll chace the nimble roebuck; may the sport More please us, than we hope. Earl Athelwold, Thou too must join our train; follow us straight. [Exeunt Edgar, &amp;c. ATHELWOLD. I will, my Liege. Elfrida, I have much For thy lov'd ear, and have but one farewel To tell it allâAnd yetâ ELFRIDA. Ah, loiter not; It may enrage. Farewel. Be sure, take heed I come not in your talk; avoid ev'n thinking; Check ev'n the sighs of absence. Haste, my Earl, Oh haste thee, as thou lov'st thy constant wife. [Exit Athelwold. ORGAR, ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ORGAR. Thy constant wife! ah, stain of all thy race, Degen'rate girl! Henceforth be Orgar deem'd Of soft, and dove-like temper, who could see A child of his stoop to such vile abasement, And yet forbore just wrath; forbore to draw That blood she had defil'd from her mean veins. But sure thou art not mine; some Elf or Fay Did spirit away my babe, and by curst charms Thee in her cradle plac'd. Nay hang not on me. Dry, dry thy tears, they've done their office amply: Edgar has pardon'd him. No, by my earldom, I cannot think of majesty thus meanly. He'll yet avenge it.âWhat if chance he should not? That stops not me: I have a heart, an arm, A sword can do me justice. ELFRIDA. Ah! my Lord, Are you still merciless? Alas! I hop'dâ ORGAR. What couldst thou hope, Elfrida? couldst thou think I e'er would pardon his vile perfidy, Or thy ignoble softness? ELFRIDA. Dearest Father, Frown not thus sternly on me. I would fain Touch your relenting soul, fain win your heart To fatherly forgiveness. For through life I've oft had pleasing proof how that forgiveness Stoop'd to my fond persuasion. But I fear Persuasion now has left me. My sad thoughts Are all on wing, all following Athelwold, Like unseen ministring spirits:âPardon, Sir, That frown shall check me, I'll not mention him; I will but plead for my own weakness, plead For that soft sympathy of soul which you Deem base and servile. Base perhaps it might be, Were I of bolder sex. But I, alas!â Ah, pardon me, if Nature stampt me Woman: Gave me a heart soft, gentle, prone to pity, And very fearful: Fearful, sure with cause At this dread hour, when if one hapless word, One sigh break forth unbid, it may rekindle The Monarch's rageâWhat has my phrenzy said? I've wander'd from my meaning. Dearest Virgins, My rash tongue more inflames him. Oh assist me, Ye are not thus opprest with inward horror: Kneel, plead, persuade, convinceâ CHORUS. Alas, my Mistress, What may a servant's accents do t'appease This furious Earl? ORGAR. Ye well may spare them: Maidens, Know my firm soul's resolv'd, and be my heart As base as Athelwold's, if it forgoes The honest resolution. Think what I, What Britain suffers from this traitor's fraud: Had Edgar rais'd my daughter to his throne, Our British line, which now is doom'd to sink In vile subjection, had again assum'd The pall of royalty, with half its power, In time, perchance, the whole. But this false Saxon Shall with his life repay me. Here I'll wait His first return, and in his own domain Give him fair combat. I have known the time When this good arm had hardihood enough For thrice his prowess. What is lost through age, My just cause shall supply; and he shall fall As did the traitor Oswald, whose bold tongue Defam'd me to King Athelstan: To the ground My sharp lance nail'd the caitiff. [Exit Orgar. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Think, my Lord, Will Athelwold, will he enter those lists, Where conquest would be parricide? Alas, He hears me not. Go, thou obdurate Father; A daughter's tears will but the more provoke thee. I will not follow him. No, poor Elfrida, All thou can'st do is here to stand, and weep, And feel that thou art wretched. CHORUS. Dearest Mistress, Restrain this flood of tears, perhapsâ ELFRIDA. Perhaps! Ah! mock me not with hopes. CHORUS. We do not mean it: For Hope, though 'tis pale Sorrow's only cordial, Has yet a dull and opiate quality, Enfeebling what it lulls. It suits not you; For, as we fearâ ELFRIDA. Do you too fear? Alas! I flatter'd my poor soul that all its fears Were grief's distemper'd coinage, that my love Rais'd causeless apprehensions, and at length Edgar would quite forgive. I do bethink me, My joy broke forth too rashly. When they left us, His safety was not half secur'd; my pleading Was not half heard; I should have follow'd Edgar, Claim'd more full pardon, forc'd him to embrace My sorrowing Lord. CHORUS. We fear that sorrow more Than Edgar's rage. We fear his fallen virtue. Self-condemnation works most strongly on him, Ev'n to despondency. Ev'n at his pardon, No joy flush'd on his cheek; we mark'd him well, He shew'd no sign of welcome. No, he took it As who should say, âTo give me aught but death âIs a poor boon unwish'd and unaccepted.â Too much we fear he'll do some impious actâ ELFRIDA. What, on his life? I thought I had explor'd Each various face of danger: this escap'd me. How miss'd I this? It suits his courage highly; Suits too his fix'd remorse.âBut yet he will not: No, Athelwold, thou wilt not kill Elfrida. CHORUS. Oh may his love preserve him: may these shades Receive him soon in peace. To this blest end You sure should strive to calm your Father's rage; At least not suffer him, as now, retir'd To brood o'er his revenge. For know, Elfrida, Beneath the silent gloom of Solitude Though Peace can sit and smile; though meek Content Can keep the cheerful tenor of her soul, Ev'n in the loneliest shades; yet let not Wrath Approach, let black Revenge keep far aloof, Or soon they flame to madness. ELFRIDA. True, my Virgins; Attend me then: I'll try each winning art: Though ill such art becomes me, yet I'll aim itâ HarkâWhence that noise? I heard some hasty footsteps. CHORUS. Oh Heav'ns! 'tis Edwin. ELFRIDA, EDWIN, CHORUS. ELFRIDA. Edwin, ah! that look Bespeaks too well the horror of thy errand. Tell it me all. EDWIN. Alas!â ELFRIDA. Nay, do not pause; Tell it me all. I think it will not kill me. Repeat each circumstance. I'm ready, Edwin, Ev'n for the worst. EDWIN. Then hear, and Heav'n support thee. Soon as the stag had left yon westward thicket, The King dismiss'd his Lords, each sev'ral ways, To their best sport, bidding Earl Athelwold, Lord Ardulph, and myself, attend his person. Thus parted from the rest, the Monarch pierc'd A darkling dell, which open'd in a lawn Thick set with elm around. Suddenly here He turn'd his steed, and cry'd, âThis place befits âOur purpose well.â ELFRIDA. Purpose! what purpose, Edwin? 'Twas predetermin'd then, dissembling tyrant! How could I trust or hopeâ EDWIN. Yet give me hearing: Thus with a grave composure, and calm eye, King Edgar spake. âNow hear me, Athelwold; âThy King has pardon'd this thy trait'rous act: âFrom all disloyal baseness to thy prince âThou stand'st absolv'd; yet, know, there still remains âSomewhat to cancel more. As man to man, âAs friend to friend, now, Athelwold, I call thee âStraight to defend thy life with thy good sword. âNay, answer not; defend it gallantly. âIf thy arm prosper, this my dying tongue âShall pardon thee, and bless thee. If thou fall'st, âThy parting breath must to my right resign âElfrida's beauties.â At the word, both drew, Both fought; but Athelwold's was ill-play'd passion. He aim'd his falchion at the Monarch's head, Only to leave his own brave breast defenceless. And on the instant Edgar's rapid sword Pierc'd my dear master's heart. He fell to earth, And, falling, cry'd, âThis wound atones for all. âEdgar, thus full aveng'd, will pardon me, âAnd my true wife, with chaste, connubial tears, âEmbalm my memory.â He smil'd, and died. ELFRIDA. Nay, come not round me, Virgins, nor support me. I do not swoon, nor weep. I call not Heav'n T'avenge my wretchedness. I do not wish This tyrant's hand may wither with cold palsies. No, I am very patient. Heav'n is just! And, when the measure of his crimes is full, Will bare its red right arm, and launch its lightnings. 'Till then, ye elements rest: and thou, firm Earth, Ope not thy yawning jaws, but let this monster Stalk his due time on thine affrighted surface. Yes; let him still go on; still execute His savage purposes, and daily make More widows weep, as I do. Foolish eyes! Why flow ye thus unbidden? What have tears To do with grief like mine? CHORUS. Help, help, my Sisters, To bear her to the castle. ORGAR, ELFRIDA, EDWIN, CHORUS. ORGAR. As I past, Methought I heard a sound of loud lament; Elfrida, ah! ELFRIDA. Is not my father there? Withhold me not; I'll fall at his dear feet. Oh, Sir! behold your child thus lowly prostrate; Avenge her wrongs, avenge your poor Elfrida, Your helpless widow'd Daughter. ORGAR. Widow'd Daughter! What; is he slain? ELFRIDA. Inhospitably butcher'd; The tyrant's savage selfâStand you thus cool? Where is the British spirit, where the fire Of Belin's race?âOh foolishness of grief! Alas, I had forgot; had Edgar spar'd him, That sword, to which my madness call'd for vengeance, Ere long was meant to do the bloody deed, And make the murder parricide. Have I No friend to do me right? ORGAR. Thou hast, my child; I am thy friend, thy father. Trust my care. Edwin, a word. Retire, my dearest Daughter: Virgins, conduct her in. ELFRIDA. My Father, No. What do you do? I must not be withheld. I'll to yon bloody grove, and clasp my Husband, My murder'd Husband. Why restrain me, Sir? Can my sad eye dart fire through his cold breast, And light up life anew? ORGAR. Go in, my child, And seek tranquillity. ELFRIDA. Tranquillity! I know her well; she is Death's pale-ey'd sister; She's now in yonder grove closing the lids Of my poor Athelwold. That office done, She'll bear his soul upon her gentle plumes Up to the realms of joy. I'll follow them: I know he'd have it so: He'll not be blest, Ev'n on his throne of bliss, till I am with him. CHORUS. This way, my dearest Mistress. ELFRIDA. Hold, nay hold; Crowd not around me. Let me pause a while. Albina, thou alone shalt join my mis'ry; I've much to utter to thy friendly ear Lead on, thou gentle maid; thy single arm Shall prop my trembling frame; thy single voice Speak peace to my afflictions. [Exit with the principal Virgin. ORGAR, EDWIN, SEMICHORUS. ORGAR. On your lives, Virgins, let no disturbing step approach her. Say, Edwin (for I guess 'twas you that brought These tidings hither) where was royal Edgar, When late you left him? EDWIN. At my master's side, Repentant of the stroke. ORGAR. Comes he not back To Harewood? SEMICHORUS. Heav'n forbid! Elfrida's brain Would madden at the sight. ORGAR. Mistake not, Virgins; I did not mean at this distressful hour The King should see my daughter. SEMICHORUS. No, for pity, Do not profane this sabbath of her grief. Oh! be her sorrow sacred! ORGAR. Fear not, Virgins; Her peace is my best care, and to ensure it, I'll haste this instant, by young Edwin's guidance, To find the Monarch. Some four miles from Harewood Stands old Earl Egbert's castle, my fast friend. With him will I persuade the King to sojourn, 'Till my child's grief abate; that too to speed Be it your business, Virgins: Watching ever Each happy interval, when your soft tongues May hint his praises, 'till by practice won She bear their fuller blazon. Elfrid's welfare Requires this friendly office at your hands; And Edgar's virtues bear such genuine lustre, That truth itself directsâ [Exit Orgar. SEMICHORUS. As Truth directs, So only shall we act. This day is shewn What dire effects await its violation. Straight is the road of Truth, and plain; And though across the sacred way Ten thousand erring footsteps stray, 'Tis ours to walk direct, And with sage caution circumspect, Pace slowly through the solemn scene. [The principal Virgin returns. SEMICHORUS. Has Orgar left the grove? SEMICHORUS. He has, my Sister. SEMICHORUS. Then hear, and aid Elfrida's last resolve, Who takes the only way stern Fate has left To save her plighted faith for ever pure To her dead Athelwold. SEMICHORUS. Forbid it, Patience, Forbid it, that submissive calm of soul, Which teaches meek-ey'd Piety to smile Beneath the scourge of Heav'n. SEMICHORUS. Ye need not fear it, She means not self-destruction. Thanks to Heav'n, Huge and o'er-bearing as her mis'ry is, It cannot so oblit'rate from her breast The deep-grav'd rule of duty. Her pure soul Means, on the instant, to devote itself To Heav'n and holiness. Assist her straight, Lest Edgar's presence, and her Father's rage Prevent the blest intention. See, she comes. Kneel on each side, devoutly kneel around her: And breathe some pray'r in high and solemn strains, That Angels from their thrones of light may hear, And ratify her vow. ELFRIDA, CHORUS. [Elfrida kneels, and the Virgins divide into two Troops. SEMICHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity. ELFRIDA. Hear first, that Athelwold's sad Widow swears To rear a hallow'd convent o'er the place, Where stream'd his blood: there will she weep thro' life Immur'd with this chaste throng of Virgins; there Each day shall six times hear her full-voic'd choir Chant the slow requiem o'er her martyr'd Lord; There too, when midnight low'rs with awful gloom, She'll rise observant of the stated call Of waking Grief, bear the dim livid taper Along the winding isles, and at the altar Kiss ev'ry pale shrine with her trembling lips, Press the cold stone with her bent knee, and call On sainted Athelwold. SEMICHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity. ELFRIDA. Hear next, that Athelwold's sad Widow swears Never to violate the holy vow She to his truth first plighted; swears to bear The sober singleness of widowhood To her cold grave. If from this chaste resolve She ev'n in thought should swerve; if gaudy pomp, Or flatt'ring greatness e'er should tempt one wish To stray beyond this purpose; may that Heav'n, Which hears this vow, punish its violation, As heav'nly justice ought. CHORUS. Hear, Angels, hear, Hear from these nether thrones of light; And O! in golden characters record Each firm, immutable, immortal word. Then wing your solemn flight Up to the heav'n of heav'ns, and there Hang the conspicuous tablet high, 'Mid the dread records of Eternity.</field>
