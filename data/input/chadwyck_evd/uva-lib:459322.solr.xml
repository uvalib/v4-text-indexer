      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF JVLIVS CÃSAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. At that time when the Romans travelled with an unsatiable ambition to subdue all Nations, by whose overthrow they could conceive any expectation, either of glory or profit: Caius Iulius CÃ¦sar, a man of a lofty minde, and given to attempt great things, ascending by severall degrees to the Consulship, procured a power to warre against the Gaules: amongst whom, after a number of admirable battels and victories (by the approbation of all the world, having purchased a singular reputation both for his courage and skill in Arms) he being long accustomed to command, was so drunke with a delight of soveraignty, that disdaining the simplicity of a private life, he was so farre from denuding himselfe of the authority which he had, that altogether transported with a desire of more, he sent to the Senate to have his government of the Gaules prorogated for five yeares: which suit being repugnant to the Lawes (as directly tending to tyranny) was by the people publikely repelled. By which occasion, and some others rising from an emulation between him and Pompey the great, pretending a high indignation, hee incontinent crossed the Alpes, with such forces (though few) as he had in readinesse, and with a great celerity came to Rome, which he found abandoned by Pompey, in whom the Senate had reposed their trust, whom shortly after, by a memorable battell in the fields of Pharsalia he discomfited: and having by the overthrow of Scipio, death of Cato, and flight of Pompeyes sonnes, as it were, rooted out all the contrary faction, he returned to Rome and indirectly by the meanes of Antonius, laboured to be proclaimed King: which having rendred him altogether odious; Caius Cassius, Marcus Brutus, Decius Brutus, Publius Casca, and divers others (Noble men) conspired his death, and appointed a day for the same: at which time, notwithstanding that CÃ¦sar was disswaded from going forth, by many monstrous apparitions, and ominous presages; yet being perswaded by Decius Brutus Albinus, he went towards the fatall place, where the Senate was assembled. The Conspirators in like manner had many terrors: amongst others, Portia the wife of Marcus Brutus, although shee had insinuated her selfe in her husbands secret by a notable proofe of extraordinary magnanimity, yet on the day dedicated for the execution of their designe, through the apprehension of his danger, she fainted divers times, whereof Brutus was advertised, yet shrinked not, but went forwards with his confederates to the appointed place, where they accomplished their purpose, every one of them giving CÃ¦sar a wound, and me a ground whereupon to build this present Tragedy.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene in Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. Juno. Though I (a Goddesse) grace the azure round, Whilst birds (all bright with eyes) my Coach do move, And am with radiant starres, heavens Empresse crown'd, The thunderers sister, wife of mighty Iove, And though I banquet in th'etheriall bowres, Where Ambrosie and Nectar serves for meate, And at the meeting of th' Immortall powres, Am still advanc'd unto the highest seat: Yet by those glorious shewes of boundlesse blisse, My burden'd minde can no way be reliev'd: Since immortality affords but this, That I live ever to be ever griev'd. In vaine, vaine mortals seeke for helpe at me, With sacred odours on my Altars throwne: What expectation can they have to see One venge their wrongs, who cannot venge her own? May Pallas then drowne thousands if she please, Who metamorphos'd Diomedes mates? And must my enemies alwaies live at ease, As me to spight appointed by the fates? Of all the dying race which lives below, With such indignities none could comport, As wound my brest, whom Gods and men doe know, To be abus'd by Iove in many a sort. Though knowne to me, from others if conceal'd, His faults might breed me griefe, but yet not shame; Where, loe, now both through heaven and earth reveal'd, Each slandrous Theater doth his scorne proclaime. If divine soules divinely liv'd aloft, The world below would imitate them then, But humaniz'd by haunting mortals oft, Where men should grow like Gods, Gods grow like men. My painted Iris in her beauties pride, Smiles not on PhÅbus with so many hewes, As Iove in divers shapes himselfe can hide, When he poore Maydes (by Cupid spurr'd) pursues; He Danae (a golden shower) deceiv'd; And did (a Swanne) in Ledaes bosome light; Then (turn'd a Bull) Agenors daughter reav'd; And Io made a Cow to mocke my sight: But O! I wish that with such wanton Dames, He still to sport would as with me remaine; Not able then to touch celestiall flames, All (like the drunkards mother) might be slaine. Then such a troupe as Rheas bosome stores, Would not hold him and me at endlesse jarres; The heavens are pestred with my husbands whores, Whose lights impure doe taint the purest starres. âThough wrongs, when grosse, are heavy to digest, âAn Actors greatnesse doth some griefe remove, âOf whom to suffer wrong it shames one least: âIf I were wrong'd âI would be wrong'd by Iove; But (ah) this long, tormented hath my brest, A Man, a Boy, a shepheard, yea, and worse, The Phrygian fire-brand, the adultrous guest, Who first wrought wrong by fraud, and then by force; He, he was he, whose verdict mov'd me most, Whilst partiall fancies judg'd of beauties right; Nor was it strange though one all judgement lost, Who had three naked Goddesses in sight; And yet I know, had not his wandring eyes The Cyprian brib'd by some lascivious smiles, My pompous birds (in triumph) through the skyes, Had borne the gold which oft her Nymphs beguiles; And am I she whose greatnesse is admir'd, Whom Iove for wife, whom thousands court for love? Whom haughty Ixion to embrace desir'd, Yet with a cloud deluded did remove? And what made me a matter to submit, Where my authority might have avail'd? Whilst though I promis'd wealth, and Pallas wit, Yet with a yong man, Venus most prevail'd; âBut how durst he of one the glory raise, âWhere two contemn'd would needs the wrong repaire? âIt spites our sexe to heare anothers praise, âOf which each one would be thought onely faire. To venge my selfe no kinde of paine I spar'd, And made his greatest gaine his greatest losse: As Venus gave him Helen for reward, I gave him Helen for his greatest crosse; Nor did he long with joy her love enjoy, Whose fatall flames his Country did confound, Whilst Armies arm'd for her did Troy destroy, And Neptunes labours levell'd with the ground; Whilst Simois seem'd to be a buriall field, Whose streams (as streets) were with dead bodies pav'd, All Zanthus Plaine (as turn'd a Sea) did yeeld A floud of bloud, from Heroes wounds receiv'd; Whilst braving thousands once, though much esteem'd, By dust and bloud deform'd, of Hector slaine, (Not like Patroclus by the sword redeem'd) The body basely was bought backe againe; Then, by the same mans sonne who kill'd his sonne, Old Priamus surpriz'd, sigh'd forth his breath, And even most harm'd where he for helpe had runne, The Altar taking, taken was by death. Though wrestling long to scape the heavens decree, (Bloud quenching lust) last parted from the light, He who lov'd Helen, and was loath'd by me, Did (as a Sacrifice) appease my spight. Then, having liv'd (if wretches have a life) Till (in all hers ere dead, oft buried spi'd) Though once known both, nor mother then, nor wife, The fertile Hecuba (made childelesse) dy'd. Thus, by those meanes it would have seem'd to some That scorned beauty had beene well reveng'd: But whilst they were o're-com'd, they did ore-come, Since they their states for better states have chang'd. I in one part that people did confound, But did enlarge their power in every place: All war-like Nations through the world renown'd, From Phrygian ruines strive to raise their race. And yet two traitors who betrayd the rest O! that the heaven on treason sometime smiles! Though having worst deserv'd, did chance the best, More happy then at home in their exiles; Did not Antenor (stealing through his foes) Neere to th' Euganian Mountaines build a Towne, Of which some nurslings once shall seeke repose, Amidst the waves, and in the depths sit downe: Their Citie (spousing Neptune) shall arise, The rarest Common-wealth that ever was, Whose people, if as stout as rich and wise, Might boast to bring miraculous things to passe. Then false Ãneas, though but borne t'obey, Did (of a fugitive) become a King: And some of his neere Tibers streames that stay, Would all the world to their obedience bring. Their ravenous Eagles soaring o're all lands, By violence a mighty prey have wonne, That bastard brood of Mars with martiall bands, Have conquer'd both the Mansions of the Sunne; Their course by mountaines could not be controld, No; Neptune could not keep his bosome free: The parching heate, nor yet the freezing cold, Their Legions limits no way could decree; Yet, of that City there can come no good, Whose rising walles with more then barbarous rage, The builder first bath'd with his brothers bloud, Which their prodigious conquests did presage. Oft hath that Towne my soule with anguish fill'd, Whose new-borne state did triumph o're my wrath, Like my old foe who in his Cradle kill'd The Serpents which I sent to give him death. By Sabins, Albans, Tuscans, oft assail'd, Even in her infancy I toss'd Romes state, Yet still Laomedons false race prevail'd, And angry Iuno could doe nought but hate. Then when the gallant Gaules had vanquish'd Rome, Who basely bought her liberty with gold, A banish'd man Camillus chanc'd to come, And her imballanc'd state redeem'd of old; Great Hanniball our common cause pursu'd, And made his bands within their bounds remaine, With Consuls and with Pretors bloud, imbru'd, At Thrasimene, and at Cannas slayne; In Romans mindes, strange thoughts did doubt infuse, But whilst they fear'd the taking of their Towne, He who could vanquish, victory not use, Was by their brasen fate (when high) thrown downe; O what a torrent of Barbarian bands, In inundations once their walles did boast, Whilst Teutons huge, and Cymbers from their Lands, Like Gyants march'd, a more then monstrous hoste? But though from parts unknowne to ruine Rome, I led those troupes which all the world admir'd, Yet did fierce Marius me with them o're-come, And I in vaine to venge old wrongs aspir'd; By meanes more base I likewise sought her harmes, Whilst Ianus Church imported never peace, I rais'd up abject Spartacus in Armes, Who neere eclips'd Romes glory with disgrace. Though I who all the world for helpe have sought, From Europe, Africke, and from Asia thus, Gaules, Carthaginians, and the Cymbers brought, Yet did the dammage still redound to us: Of heaven and earth I all the pow'rs have prov'd, And for their wracke have each advantage watch'd; But they by forraine force cannot be mov'd: By Romans, Romans onely may be match'd. And I at last have kindled civill warre, That from their thoughts (which now no reason bounds) Not onely laws, but Natures laws doth barre; The Sonne the Syre, the brother brother wounds; Whil'st th'Eagles are oppos'd to th'Eagles so, O what contentment doth my minde attaine! No wound is wrong bestow'd, each kills a foe, What ever side doth lose, I alwayes gaine. But this my soule exceedingly annoyes, That all at one time cannot be supprest: âThe warre helps some, as others it destroyes, And those who hate me most, still prosper best. Whil'st with their bloud their glory thousands spend, Ah! ones advancement aggravates my woe, Who vaunts himselfe from Venus to descend, As if he claim'd by kinde to be my foe. I meane the man whose thoughts nought can appease, Whil'st, them too high a blinde ambition bends, Whom (as her minion) Fortune bent to please, Her rarest treasures prodigally spends; Not onely hath he daunted by the Sword The Gauls, the Germans, and th'Ãgyptians now, But of all Lords pretends to be made Lord, That who command the world to him may bow; Thus dispossessing Princes of their Thrones, Whil'st his Ambition nothing can asswage, That the subjected world in bondage grones, The prey of pride, the sacrifice to rage, âMen raile on Iove, and sigh for Saturnes time, âAnd to the present, Ages past preferre, âThen burden would the Gods with every crime, âAnd damne the heavens, where onely th'earth doth erre. Though Iove (as stupid) still with Cupid sports, And not the humour of proud CÃ¦sar spies? Who may (if forcing thus the worlds chiefe Forts) Then Titans earst, more pow'rfull, scale the skies. Yet lest he thrall him too, who none free leaves, We from the bounds above him must repell, To brawle with Pluto in th'umbragious Caves, There since he will be first, made first in hell. What? with that Tyrant I will straight be even, And send his soule to the Tartarian grove: Though Iove will not be jealous of his heaven, Yet Iuno must be jealous of her Iove; And though none in the heavens would do him ill, I'le raise up some in th'earth to haste his death: Yea, though both heaven and earth neglect my will, Hell can afford me Ministers of wrath: I'le crosse Cocytus, and the smoaking lakes, To borrow thence my brothers damned bands; The furies arm'd with fire-brands, and with Snakes, Shall plant their hell where Rome so stately stands; Whil'st Furies furious by my fury made, Do spare the dead to have the living pin'd: O! with what joy will I that Army leade? âNought then revenge more calmes a wronged minde; I must make this a memorable age, By this high vengeance which I have conceiv'd: But what though thousands dye t'appease my rage? So CÃ¦sar perish, let no soule be sav'd. Exeunt. Chorus. âWe should be loath to grieve the gods, âWho hold us in a ballance still; âAnd as they will âMay weigh us up, or downe; âThose who by folly foster pride, âAnd to deride âThe terrour of the Thunderers rods, âIn seas of sinne their soules do drowne, âAnd others them abhorre as most unjust, âWho want Religion do deserve no trust: How dare fraile flesh presume to rise (Whil'st it deserves heavens wrath to prove) On th'earth to move, Lest that it opening straight, Give death and buriall both at once? How dare such ones Look up unto the skies, For feare to feele the Thunderers weight? âAll th' Elements their Makers will attend, âAs prompt to plague, as men are to offend. All must be plagu'd who God displease, Then whil'st he Bacchus rites did scorne, Was Pentheus torne; The Delians high disdaine Made Niobe (though turn'd a stone) With teares still mone, And (Pallas to appease) Arachne weaves loath'd webbes in vaine: Heaven hath prepar'd cre ever they begin, A fall for pride, a punishment for sinne. Loe, Iuno yet doth still retaine That indignation once conceiv'd, For wrong receiv'd From Paris as we finde; And for his cause (bent to disgrace The Trojan race) Doth hold a high disdaine, Long layd up in a loftie minde: âWe should abstaine from irritating those âWhose thoughts (if wrong'd) not till reveng'd repose. Thus, thus for Paris fond desire, Who of his pleasures had no part, For them must smart: Such be the fruits of lust; Can heavenly breasts so long time lodge A secret grudge? Like Mortals thrall to Ã¿re, Till justice sometime seemes unjust? âOf all the furies which afflict the soule, âLust and revenge are hardest to controull: The Gods give them but rarely rest, Who do against their will contend, And plagues do spend, That fortunate in nought, Their sprits (quite parted from repose) May still expose The stormy troubled brest A prey to each tyrannicke thought: âAll selfe-accusing soules no rest can finde, âWhat greater torment then a troubled minde? Let us adore th'immortall powers, On whose decree, of all that ends, The state depends, That (farre from barbarous broiles) We of our life this little space May spend in peace Free from afflictions showres; Or at the least from guilty toyles; âLet us of rest the treasure strive to gaine, âWithout the which nought can be had but paine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scene 1. Iulius CÃ¦sar, Marcus Antonius. Now have my hopes attain'd the long'd for heaven, In spight of partiall Envies poysnous blasts: My Fortune with my courage hath prov'd even; No Monument of miscontentment lasts. Those who corrival'd me, by me o're-throwne, Did by their falls give feathers to my flight: I in some corner rather live unknowne Then shine in glory, and not shine most bright; What common is to two, rests no more rare, In all the world no PhÅnix is save one, That of my deeds none challenge might a share, Would God that I had acted all alone: And yet at last I need to mourne no more For envy of the Macedonians praise, Since I have equall'd all that went before; My deeds in number do exceed my dayes. Some earst (whose deeds rest registred by Fame) Did from their Conquests glorious titles bring, But Greatnesse to be great, must have my name, To be a CÃ¦sar is above a King. Ant. Those warre-like Nations, which did Nations spoile, Are by thy Legions to our laws made thrall; âWhat can brave mindes not do by time and toyle? âTrue magnanimity triumphs o're all. CÃ¦s. Th'out-ragious Gauls who in most monstrous swarmes Went wasting Asia, thundering downe all things, And (Macedony quaking at their Armes) Did insolently make, and un-make Kings: Those Gauls who having the worlds Conquerours foil'd, (As if the world might not have match'd them then) Would sacrilegiously have Delphos spoil'd, And warr'd against the Gods, contemning men; Yea, those whose Ancestors our City burn'd, (The onely people whom the Romanes fear'd) By me (Romes nursling) match'd, and o're-match'd mourn'd: So what they first eclips'd, againe they clear'd. Then, as to Subjects having given degrees, The Gauls no more presuming of their might, I (wounding Neptunes bosome with wing'd trees) Did with the world-divided Britains fight; The Germans from their birth inur'd to warre, Whose martiall mindes still haughtie thoughts have bred, Whil'st neither men, nor walls, my course could barre, (Mask'd with my banners) saw their Rhene runne red; The Easterne Realmes when conqu'ring now of late, My comming, and o're-comming was but one; With little paine ear'st Pompey was call'd great, Who fought soft bands whose glorious dayes were gone: But what though thousands set ones praises forth, For fields which shadows, and not swords, obtain'd; The rate (too easie) vilifies the worth: âSave by great paines, no glory can be gain'd: From dangers past, my comfort now proceeds, Since all who durst gaine-stand I did o're-come: And, in few words to comprehend my deeds, Rome conquer'd all the world, and CÃ¦sar, Rome. Ant. Loe those who striv'd your vertue to suppresse, (As whose great actions made them jealous still) Whil'st labouring but too much to make you lesse, Have made you to grow great against your will: Great Pompeys pompe is past, his glory gone, And rigorous Cato by himselfe lyes kill'd; Then dastard Cicero more your honours none, Thus all your foes are with confusion fill'd. The Senatours who could not be asswag'd, Long to your prejudice their pow'r abus'd, Till at their great ingratitude enrag'd, I swore our swords would grant what they refus'd. When having scap'd, endanger'd, and despis'd, Brave Curio and I did to your Camp resort, In old bare gownes (like some base slaves) disguis'd, All sigh'd to see us wrong'd in such a sort. CÃ¦s. The highest in the heaven who knows all hearts, Do know my thoughts as pure as are their Starres, And that (constrain'd) I came from forraine parts To seeme uncivill in the civill warres. I mov'd that warre which all the world bemoanes, Whil'st urg'd by force to free my selfe from feares; Still when my hand gave wounds, my heart gave groanes; No Romans bloud was shed, but I shed teares: But how could any elevated spright, Who had for honour hazarded his blood, Yeeld willingly (by foes outragious spight) To be defrauded of th'expected good: When as a multitude of battels wonne, Had made Romes Empire, and my glory great; And that the Gauls (oft vanquish'd) had begun To beare the yoke which they disdain'd of late. Then glorious Pompey, my proud sonne-in-law, And Cato (who still cross'd what I design'd) From favouring me the people did with-draw, And had a successour for spight assign'd; Not that he should succeed in dangerous broils, But (even through envy) as they had ordain'd, That he might triumph so of all my toils, And rob the glory which I dearly gain'd; With such indignity who could comport, When prizing honour dearer then the light? No (whil'st my soule rests soveraigne of this fort) None shall have pow'r to rob me of my right: And yet by Iove who all the world commands, To use such violence I did mislike: And would have oft abandon'd all my bands, If that mine enemies would have done the like; But yet the multitude, which floting still (As waves with windes) are carried with conceits, With nought but my disgrace would bound their will, And I committed all unto the fates. Yet when at Rubicon I stood perplex'd, And weigh'd the horrour of my high attempt, My stormy soule a thousand fancies vex'd, Which resolution buried in contempt. Ant. âNought in a Captaine more confounds his foes, âThen of a ventrous course, the swift effects, âSince (so quite crush'd) ere they their thoughts dispose, âAll good advice a care confus'd neglects. Though when you march'd to Rome, your pow'r was small, The sudden news so thundred in each eare, That (as if heaven had falne upon them all) It bred amazement, and th'amazement feare. âSome secret destiny (as then was seene) âDoth guide mens actions, and their judgement bounds: âThose who by hosts could not have frighted beene, âA shadow, or a rumour oft confounds: âAll hastie dangers so surprise the minde, âThat feare prevents the resolutions power, âOr else the fates make curious Reason blinde, âWhen heavens determin'd have a fatall houre. Great Pompey (loe) who was growne ag'd in armes, And had triumph'd o're all the worlds three parts, Whil'st (quite discourag'd, by imagin'd harmes) Fled Rome, though without reach of th'enemies darts. As to a torrent all gave place to you, And whom they call'd a rebell made their Lord; Your successour Domitius (forc'd to bow) Did trust your favour, more then feare your sword. When in th'Iberian bounds you did arrive, There, Adversaries (who did vainly vaunt) Had all th'advantage that the ground could give, Of victuals plenty, which with us were scant. Yet the celerity that you had us'd, Did so discourage their disordred band, That (as Iove in their breasts had feare infus'd) They had no strength against our strokes to stand. And when Romes Generall with brave legions stor'd, Seem'd to possesse all that his soule requir'd, Whil'st us to daunt, both famine and the sword, The Sea, the Land, and all in one conspir'd; Then, for your offices they did contend, As those who of the victory were sure, And (where they might th'affaires of state attend) In Rome for lodgings fondly did procure. Yet memorable now that day remaines, When all the world was in two Armies rang'd, Whil'st Mars went raging through th'Ãmathian plaines, And to despaires high expectations chang'd; When Pompeys partie had the battell lost; (As Lyons do their prey) you did pursue The scattred remnant of that ruin'd host, On which new heads still (like a Hydra) grew. Though victory in Africke fatall seem'd To any Army that a Scipio led, Yet, you shew'd there (for worth in warre esteem'd) That Rome a better then a Scipio bred; And all our Enemies were confounded thus, Who us in number ever did surmount; But CÃ¦sar and his fortune were with us, Which we did more then many thousands count. CÃ¦s. The sweetest comfort which my conquests gave, Was that I so might do to many good: For, every day some Romanes life I save, Who in the field to fight against me stood, Thus, may my minde be judg'd by the event, Who (even when by my greatest foes assail'd) To winne the battell never was more bent, Then prompt to pardon when I had prevail'd. Not covetous of bloud, of spoyls, nor harmes, I (even when victor) did insult o're none, But layd aside all hatred with my Armes, A foe in fight, a friend when it was gone: âOf clemency I like the praise, more then âOf force, which mortals with affliction lodes; âStrength oft may prove the worst thing that's in men, âAnd pity is the best thing in the Gods. Sterne Cato (still affecting to be free) Who either death or life (if given) disdain'd, Thy death I envy, who didst envy me, The glory that I (saving thee) had gain'd. Yet I to Rents and dignities restore, Even those who long my ruine had design'd: And O! it doth delight my minde farre more, By benefits, then by constraint to binde. Ant. I would have all my foes brought to their ends, CÃ¦s. I rather have my foes all made my friends. Ant. Their bloud whom I suspect'd should quench all strife. CÃ¦s. So might one do who lik'd of nought but life. Ant. Still life would be redeem'd from dangers forth. CÃ¦s. Not with a ransome then it selfe more worth. Ant. Then life to man, what thing more deare succeeds? CÃ¦s. The great contentment that true glory breeds. Ant. Men by all meanes this blast of breath prolong: CÃ¦s. Men should strive to live well, not to live long. And I would spend this momentary breath To live by fame for ever after death: For, I aspire in spight of fates to live. Ant. I feare that some too soone your death contrive. CÃ¦s. Who dare but lodge such thoughts within their mindes? Ant. Those whom the shadow of your Greatnesse blindes. CÃ¦s. The best are bound to me by gifts in store. Ant. But to their Countrey they are bound farre more. CÃ¦s. Then loath they me as th'Enemy of the state? Ant. Who freedome love, you (as usurper) hate. CÃ¦s. I by great battels have enlarg'd their bounds. Ant. By that they thinke your pow'r too much abounds. CÃ¦s. From doing wrong, yet I refraine my will. Ant. They feare your pow'r, because it may do ill. CÃ¦s. The present state still miscontentment brings To factious mindes affecting matters strange, Which (burdens to themselves) do loath all things, And so they change, regard not what they change. In populous Townes where many do repaire, (Who at their meeting what they please do touch) They further then their bounds extend their care: âThe idle who do nothing, must thinke much. Loe, Rome (though wasted all with raging warres) Whil'st private grudge pretended publike good, Equality (still rude) engendring jarres, Did prove too prodigall of Roman blood. Though yet now at the last attaining rest, Whil'st all (obeying one) may banish teares: It (if constrain'd) even scorns (as bad) the best, This word necessity so wounds the eares. The insolent with vile seditious words, (Who trembled whil'st they heard the Trumpets sound) Stirre now their tongues, as we did then our swords, And what Mars spar'd, make Mercury confound. âThe people thus in time of peace agree âTo curbe the great men still, even in that forme, âAs in calme dayes they do disbranch the Tree, âWhich shrowded them of late against a storme. But now I look'd (brave deeds appeasing spight) That bursted Envy should for anguish dye, Darke shadows (as asham'd) do vanish quite, When at his height bright PhÅbus cleares the skie. And though their hatred deeply they disguise, Yet can they not so hide enflam'd desires, But that their spight rests sparkling through their eyes, And boasts to burst out straight in open fires. Ant. Since first (great CÃ¦sar) I discern'd thy worth, On all thy actions I did still attend; And what some whisper must speake freely forth: âFranke admonitions do become a friend. The men who do suspect that you aspire Of government the present forme to change, All in their soules your ruine do conspire, And their affections farre from you estrange. Since chast Lucretia (by proud Tarquin stain'd) Wash'd with her bloud the violated bed, Whil'st by his pow'r Rome basely was constrain'd, All to obey which his curst braine had bred. This government which some tyrannicke call, Doth sound so odious in the peoples eares, That they as Tyrants vile, detest them all, Whose greatnesse gives them any cause of feares. CÃ¦s. I not affect the title of a King For love of glory, or desire of gaine, Nor for respect of any private thing, But that the State may by my travels gaine. You know Sibylla's books which never faile; In many mindes have an opinion bred, That o're the Parthians Rome cannot prevaile, Till by a Prince her valorous Bands be led: âFor, as confusion is the fruit (we finde) âOf those affaires which divers thoughts dispose, âSo Soveraignty match'd with a gallant minde, âBreeds reverence in ones owne, feare to his foes. And O! it grieves me, that these steps of ours Have trod so oft on many a millions necks, Whil'st yet the Parthian vilipends our pow'rs, And all our victories (not vanquish'd) checks; Ah! should a Generall of the Roman race Be by Barbarians kill'd? and not reveng'd? And should his Ensignes, signes of our disgrace, Rest in the ranke of conquer'd relicts rang'd? No, no, (wretch'd Crassus) now thy selfe content, Ile pacifie thy Ghost with Parthians spoyles, My boyling fancies have beene alwayes bent To match the matchlesse, daunt th'undaunted soiles. Ant. With victories quite cloi'd, will you not then Your safety once, more then new warres respect? CÃ¦s. No, though I have surmounted other men, My fancies yet do greater things affect: In emulation of my selfe at last, I even with envy look on my owne deeds; And (bent to make the new surpasse things past) Now to my minde stale praise no pleasure breeds. Ant. The world hath seene thee (great man) for Romes good, In danger oft of many a dangerous shelfe, Whil'st for her glory thou engag'd thy bloud, Of others carefull, carelesse of thy selfe. CÃ¦s. Though whil'st in th'Aprill of my blooming age, I from the vulgar rate redeem'd my name, Some with my deeds did burden youths hot rage, And an ambitious appetite of Fame, Yet since the coldnesse of declining yeares, Boasts to congeale the bloud which boil'd of late, Whil'st loe, my life the Sunne of glory cleares, Who now of all the world am knowne most great; I cannot covet that thing which I have, I have all honour that can be requir'd: And now (as that which wants) would onely crave To taste the pleasures of a life retyr'd: But (save to serve the State) for nought I strive, For, O! (neglecting th'ecchoes of renowne) I could content my selfe unknowne to live A private man, with a Plebeian gowne: Since (Anthonie) thus for the state I care, And all delights which Nature loves disdaine; Go, and in time the peoples mindes prepare, That, as the rest, I may the title gaine; Yet indirectly at the first assay To what their doubtfull mindes do most incline, But as without my knowledge, that they may All marke your minde, and yet not thinke of mine. Exeunt. Scene 2. Cicero, Decius, Brutus. Did I survive th'impetuous Scilla's rage, And in a torrent of destruction stood, Whil'st Tyrants did make Rome a tragicke stage Through a voluptuous appetite of bloud? Scap'd I confusion in a time so bad, Of liberty and honour once to taste, That bondage now might make my soule more sad By the remembrance of my fortunes past? What though I once (when first by Fame made knowne) From Catilines strange treason did preserve This Towne (when free from foes) thrall'd by her owne, Since now the world from equity doth swerve? A sparke of that conspiracy I spie As yet not quench'd to have our state imbroil'd, Which Rome to burne makes many flames to flie: Thus one was spar'd, that we might all be spoil'd. O worthy Cato, in whose matchlesse minde Three (rarely match'd) things Nature did reveale, Wit, Honesty, and Courage, which design'd A Citizen for Plato's common-weale: Whil'st courteous Pompey did things as a friend, Thou as a wise-man spoke, and still fore-told To what all CÃ¦sars deeds would turne in th'end, If that his pride were not in time controld. And had we him (as wisely thou advis'd) Given to the Germans whom he had injur'd, We had not now beene thus like slaves despis'd, To see Rome's glory, and our owne obscur'd: But yet I may (disbending former cares) A space comport with that proud Tyrants pow'r; Age gives assurance by my hoarey haires, Ere he Romes freedome, death will me devour. But all whose youth and sprite might have attain'd Those dignities which CÃ¦sar hath undone: O! ye have lost as much as he hath gain'd, Whose rising hopes must be retrench'd so soone. Dec. Though innovations at the first seeme strange, Yet oft experience approbation brings, And if with upright thoughts we weigh this change, From thence the safety of our City springs; As doth a ship, when toss'd by severall windes, More danger runne whil'st Pylots do contest, So was our City vex'd by differing mindes, Who did interpret laws as pleas'd them best; Whil'st for one sicknesse divers drugges are us'd, Whose pow'rs (repugnant) in digestion jarre, Th'impatient patients perish, when abus'd, So did we long whil'st cross'd by civill warre; But now great CÃ¦sar from tempestuous windes, Romes scattered ruines recollects of late: A Pilot meet to calme tumultuous mindes, A fit Physitian for an aguish State. Cic. The State from stormes secure by drowning proves, Now whil'st despaire doth doubtfull feares appease; He (with the life) the sicknesse quite removes: Thus is the Physick worse then the Disease. This Common-weale (as all the world did spie) Was by proud spirits in civill warres involv'd, Yet like black Clouds which would obscure the skie, These tumid humours suddenly dissolv'd; And no disgrace unto the state redounds, But to th'Ambitious men that it abus'd, Who (had their pow'r like CÃ¦sars wanted bounds) Would (whil'st they rul'd) have greater rigour us'd. All parts (we see) bred people of all kindes, And as advanc'd some bad men did abide, In pow'r their equals, and of better mindes, Some alwayes vertuous were to curbe their pride, But since that sacred liberty was lost, The publike pow'r to private ends one turnes: And (as his lawlesse wayes did alwayes boast) The Common-weale by violence o're-turnes. Dec. Though what you burden CÃ¦sar with were true, Necessity hath purg'd his part from crime, Who was (foes force to shunne) forc'd to pursue, And urg'd by danger to attempt in time. To th'enemies envy more oblig'd he rests, Then to his wit which no such courses scan'd: For when quite barr'd from using of requests, Th'occasion then invited to command. His thoughts when calme, to storm fond foes did tempt: âTrue worth disdaines to suffer open wrong: âA gallant courage kindled by contempt âBurns with revenge, whil'st fury makes one strong. Cic. O Decius, now a wrong account you cast, The purpose, not th'event, declares the minde: Tread backe the steps of all his actions past, And what he compass'd had beene long design'd. As by some sprite inspir'd, proud Scilla said, That there in CÃ¦sar many Marians were, And Rome in time was warn'd to be afraid Of that evill-girded youth, with smooth-comb'd haire; Then when (as still to quietnesse a foe) The memory of Marius he renew'd, By re-erecting Tyrants statues so, His thoughts all bent to tyranny were view'd. That people-pleaser might have beene perceiv'd, By courteous complements below his rank, Who (lavishing forth gifts) the world deceiv'd, And to gaine more then his, of his prov'd franke. Though nought at all indulgent to his wife, By prostrated pudicity disgrac'd; Yet did he save th'adultrous Clodius life, To sooth the multitude, whose steps he trac'd. Dec. âThese be the meanes by which Ambition mounts, âWithout most humble, when within most high, âAs if it fled from that thing which it hunts, âStill wasting most, when it for most doth plie. Cic. Then he (still tyranny bent to embrace) Was thought conjoyn'd with Catiline to be, And, had wise Cato's counsell taken place, Might with the rest have suffered death by me. Yet having deeply div'd in some mens soules, With factious followers being pined oft, He got the Consul-ship which nought controuls, And matching pride with pow'r, did look aloft; To flatter them who now must flatter him, His pow'r to make unlawfull laws prevail'd, And those to crosse who scorn'd he so should clime, He furnish't was with force, where reason fail'd: But yet because he could not be assur'd To rule alone according to his will, To governe France, he craftily procur'd, So to be strengthened with an Army still. As Rome first warr'd at home, till being strong, She thought her power might forraine Realmes o're-come: So CÃ¦sar warr'd against strange Nations long, Till that he thought his Might might conquer Rome. Then having all that force or fate assignes, Of discontentment he did cause pretend, So to dissemble fore-conceiv'd designes: âOne soone may finde a fault that would offend: But when he first in a prodigious dreame, His mother seem'd incestuously to use, It might have shown to his eternall shame, How of his birth the bounds he did abuse. Dec. And yet I thinke (avoyding threatned harmes) He by constraint imbark'd in civill broyles: Did he not covenant to quite his Armes, As not desirous of his Countries spoiles? Cic. Durst he with those who had his charge consin'd, Stand to capitulate, as if their mate, Where (as his Soveraigne) to obey their minde, It was his duty, and their due of late. What? what? durst he whom (bound to keep the law) The people in authority did put The sword which they had given, against them draw; When it was sharpned first their throat to cut? That had not come which all our anguish breeds, If he unforc'd when as his charge expir'd; Till that the Senate censur'd had his deeds, Had from his Province peaceably retir'd. No, he hath but betray'd his native Towne, Those bands, by which she did him first preferre, T' enlarge her borders, and his owne renowne Those hath he us'd to tyrannize o're her. My passions (ah! transported as you see With an excessive love to my deare soile) Of my hearts store have made my tongue too free, By flaming forth what in my brest doth boile. Dec. That CÃ¦sars part might justly be excus'd, Loe, with the cause alledg'd, his course accords, Of which that mildenesse which he since hath us'd, A testimony to the world affords. Though forc'd to fight, he alwaies had great care To save our Citizens as each man knowes, And will'd his Captaines Romans still to spare; Barbarians bodies objects were for blowes, Of th'adversaries after bloudy strife, When oft he might have made some Captives smart, Not onely was he liberall of their life, But pardon'd them, even to take Pompeys part; At that infortunate Pharsalian field, When he securely might have us'd the sword, He both did spare all th'enemies that would yeeld, And them to rents and dignities restor'd: Then when th'Egyptians (so to get reliefe) Brought to his sight pale Pompey's bloud-lesse head, He testifi'd with teares his inward griefe, And grac'd his Statues after he was dead. Those his proceedings plainely may approve, That he against his will did make this warre; And to his Country beares a tender love, Who could comport to reyne his rage so farre. Cic. Those favours fain'd, by him bestow'd, or due, (As is ones custome whose high heart aspires,) Were spent on many that who them did view Might love his course, so kindling their desires: But where he thus pleas'd some, he spoil'd whole hosts, And the Barbarians all to Rome not wrought Such harme as he, who, of his goodnesse boasts, Yet her best men hath to confusion brought; That great man, whom earst fortune ne're did fayle, Who still prevail'd, though warring without right, Now in a good cause, for the common-weale With CÃ¦sar did infortunately fight. Whilst fled from Lesbos with his wretched wife, Three base-borne Groomes (can fortune change so soone?) Stood to consult upon great Pompeys life, And did what thousands durst not once have done; Then he whose knees had oft been kiss'd by Kings, (Most highly happy, had he dy'd in time) By one of his owne slaves, with abject things His funerals had perform'd; what monstrous crime Romes greatest Captaine to entombe alone? The Roman who arriv'd with reason said: The fatall glory was too great for one, And to have part of that last honour staid; The teares bestow'd by CÃ¦sar on his head, Forth from a guilty minde, remorse had throwne: Or else he wept to see his enemie dead By any others hands then by his owne. That constant Cato, who even death did scorne, And for a coward once had CÃ¦sar brav'd, (Who liv'd as if to grace all mortals borne) Would rather perish then by him be sav'd. He justly whilst more just, himselfe more strong Then CÃ¦sar thought, who for no justice car'd: And since discovering what he cloak'd so long, Said, that the other, and not he was snar'd. Thus CÃ¦sar conquer'd all but Cato's minde, Who to a tyrant would not owe his breath: But in such sort his famous course confin'd, Then CÃ¦sars life, more glorious was his death: Those great men thus brought to disastrous ends, The author of their death make me despise, Who to usurpe all pow'r while as he tends, By treading good men downe, doth strive to rise. Now made most great by lessening all the great, He proudly doth triumph in Rome, o're Rome: And we must seeme to like the present state, Whose doubtfull breath depends upon his doome. Yet had I not enlarg'd my griefes so long, To you whom CÃ¦sar doth pretend to love; Save that (I know) touch'd with the common wrong: âA just disdaine all generous mindes must move. Dec. Had CÃ¦sar willingly resign'd his Armes, And rendred Rome her liberty at last, When as from foes he fear'd no further harmes, But had repair'd his just displeasures past, More then for all that could be done for me, He should have had an Altar in my brest, As worthy (for his vertuous deeds) to be Fear'd by the bad, and honour'd by the best: But since (though conqu'ring all the world by might) He (to himselfe a slave) would make Rome thrall, His benefits are loathsome in my sight, And I am griev'd that he deserves to fall; My fancies move not in so low a sphere, But I disdaine that one Romes Crowne requires; Yet it is best that with the time we beare, And with our pow'r proportion our desires. Though first dissembling, so your minde to try, I told what fame to CÃ¦sars praise relates; Yet was I pleas'd, that moe were griev'd then I: âAll miscontented men are glad of Mates. Cic. Since tyranny all liberty exiles, We must our selves (no more our selves) disguise; Then, learne to maske a mourning minde with smiles, And seeme to like that which we most despise. Yet all our deeds not CÃ¦sars humour please, Who (since mistrusting once) esteemes us still, When dumb disdainefull, flatterers when we praise, If plaine, presumptuous, and in all things ill: Yea, we, whose freedome CÃ¦sar now restraines, As his attenders all his steps must trace; And know, yet not acknowledge his disdaines, But still pretend an interest in his grace: Though all my thoughts detest him as a foe, To honour him, a thousand meanes I move, Yet but to save my selfe, and plague him so: âNo hate more harmes then it that lookes like love. His pride is by prepost'rous state growne such, That by the better sort, he is abhorr'd; The gods are jealous, and men envy much To see a mortall man so much ador'd. Dec. Well, Cicero let all meanes be entertain'd, That may embarke us in his bosomes deepes, Till either willingly, or then constrain'd, He justly quite what he unjustly keepes. Exeunt. Chorus. âThis life of ours is like a Rose, âWhich whilst rare beauties it array, âDoth then enjoy the least repose; âWhen Virgin-like made blush (we see) âOf every hand it is the prey, âAnd by each winde is blowne away; âYea, though from violence scap'd free, â(Thus time triumphs, and leades all thrals) âYet doth it languish and decay: âO! whilst the courage hottest boiles, âAnd that our life seemes best to be, âIt is with dangers compast still; âWhilst it each little change appalles, âThe body, force, without oft foiles, âIt th' owne distemp'rature oft spoiles, âAnd even, though none it chance to kill, âAs nature failes, the body falles, âOf which save death, nought bounds the toyles; âWhat is this moving Tow'r in which we crust? âA little winde clos'd in a cloud of dust. And yet some sprites though being pent In this fraile prisons narrow bounds, (Whilst what might serve, doth not content,) Doe alwaies bend their thoughts too high, And ayme at all the peopled grounds; Then whilst their brests Ambition wounds, They feed as fearing straight to dye, Yet build as if they still might live, Whilst famish'd for fames empty sounds: Of such no end the travell ends, But a beginning gives, whereby They may be vex'd worse then before; For, whilst they still new hopes contrive, âThe hoped good more anguish sends, âThen the possess'd contentment lends; As beasts not taste, but doe devoure, They swallow much, and for more strive, Whilst still their hope some change attends: âAnd how can such but still themselves annoy, âWho can acquire, but know not how t'enjoy? Since as a ship amidst the deepes, Or as an Eagle through the ayre, Of which no way th' impression keepes, Most swift when seeming least to move; This breath of which we take such care, Doth tosse the body every where, That it may hence with haste remove: âLife slips and sleepes alwayes away, âThen hence, and as it came, goes bare, Whose steppes behinde no trace doe leave; Why should heaven-banish'd soules thus love The cause, and bounds of their exile, As restlesse strangers where they stray? And with such paine why should they reave That which they have no right to have, Which with them in a little while, As summers beauties must decay, And can give nought except the grave? âThough all things doe to harme him what they can, âNo greater enemie then himselfe to man; Whilst oft environ'd with his foes, Which threatned death on every side, Great CÃ¦sar parted from repose, (As Atlas holding up the Starres,) Did of a world the weight abide; But since a prey to foolish pride, More then by all the former warres, He now by it doth harm'd remaine, And of his fortune doth diffide Made rich by many Nations wreake, He (breaking through the liquid barres) In Neptunes armes his Minion forc'd; Yet still pursu'd new hopes in vaine: âWould the ambitious looking backe âOf their inferiours knowledge take, âThey from huge cares might be divorc'd, âWhilst viewing few, more pow'r attaine, âAnd many more then they to lacke: âThe onely plague from men that rest doth reave, âIs that they weigh their wants, not what they have. Since thus the great themselves involve In such a labyrinth of cares, Whence none to scape can well resolve, But by degrees are forward led, Through waves of hopes, rockes of despaires: Let us avoyd ambitions snares, And farre from stormes by envy bred, Still seeke (though low) a quiet rest, With mindes where no proud thought repaires, That in vaine shadowes doth delight; Thus may our fancies still be fed With that which Nature freely gives; Let us iniquity detest, And hold but what we owe of right; Th' eyes treasure is th' all-circling light, Not that vaine pompe for which pride strives, Whose glory (but a poysnous pest) To plague the soule, delights the sight: âEase comes with ease, where all by paine buy paine, âRest we in peace, by warre let others raigne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 3. Scene 1. Caius Cassius, Marcus Brutus. Now (Brutus) now we need no more to doubt, Nor with blinde hopes our judgement to suspend, That flatt'rers credit (loe) is quite worne out; We must in time attempt, and not attend: That race of victors which did Realmes appall, Ah (vanquish'd by their victories at last) Are by their too much liberty made thrall, Since all their strength but down themselves doth cast; And we who by our birth-aym'd at great things, Of the worlds mistresse mighty minions once, Who might have labour'd to give lawes to Kings, Lawes from a King, must looke for now with grones: For, such of CÃ¦sar is the monstrous pride, That though he domineers even at this houre, And to his Clients kingdomes doth divide With an unlimited tyrannicke pow'r; Yet of Dictator he disdaines the name, And seekes a tyrants title with the place, Not for his honour, no, but for our shame, As onely bent to bragge of our disgrace. Marc. Brut. I thought to see that man (as others are) Walke re-apparrell'd with a private gowne, As one who had unwillingly made warre, To stand himselfe, not to cast others downe: So Silla (though more inhumane then he) Whilst having all to what his heart aspir'd, The Soveraignty resign'd, and set Rome free, When expectations date was quite expir'd. By CÃ¦sars worth we must thinke that he too Will render freedome to this captiv'd state, When first the world hath view'd what he might doe, His thoughts are generous, as his minde is great. Though insolencies oft from courage flow, His dying fury sparkles but a space: âHigh thoughts which Mars inspires, nought can bring low, âTill one have us'd the purity of peace. âThose who by violence to all things tend, âScarce can themselves to quietnesse conforme; âTheir stately carriage, and franke words, offend, âWhil'st peace cannot comport with warres rude forme, I hope that CÃ¦sar setling civill broyles, When worne by custome from intestine rage, Will strive to mitigate his Countries toyles, And all those flames which burn'd his brest, asswage. Ca. Cassius. Thus, of his course you by your owne conceiv'd, As if like thoughts of both did bound the will: âAh, honest mindes are with least paine deceiv'd, âThose who themselves are good, dreame not of ill. âTo sound of some the still unsound device, âTheir inclination must your judgement sway: âThe square of vertue cannot measure vice, âNor yet a line when straight, a crooked way. So CÃ¦sar rising may usurpe the State, He cares not by what force, nor by what sleight: âO! one may soone deceive men, and grow great, âWho leaves religion, honesty and right. When as the Senators (no more their owne) Came to that Tyrant whom ambition blindes, And by high honours shew'd how they had showne To gratifie his greatnesse, gratefull mindes; He (in a Chayre imperiously plac'd,) Not daign'd to rise, nor bow in any sort, As both of them had but their due embrac'd, When he a haughty, they a humble port. But if he thus, ere we be throughly thrall'd, Dare so disdainefully such great men use, When in a regall Throne by us enstall'd, Then will he breake that which he now doth bruise. Was he not first who ever yet began To violate the sacred Tribunes place, And punish'd them for punishing a man Who had transgress'd the lawes in time of peace? The lawes which doe of death all guilty hold, Whose actions seeme to tyranny inclin'd, So earnest were our Ancestors of old, To quench a tyrants light before it shin'd: And shall our Nephewes (heires of bondage) blame Vs dastard parents who their hopes deceiv'd, Who saw, who suff'red, who surviv'd such shame, Not leaving dead, what we when borne receiv'd? By CÃ¦sars friends, to an assembly brought, The Senators intend to call him King. Brut. I'le not be there. Cass. But what if we be sought To ayde (as Pretors) such a publike thing? Brut. I will resist that violent decree; None of Romes Crowne shall long securely boast: For, ere that I live thrall'd, I'le first dye free, âWhat can be kept when liberty is lost? Cass. O! with what joy I swallow up those words, Words worthy of thy worth, and of thy name: But (Brutus) doe not feare, this cause affords In danger many, but few mates in fame; When Anthony proud CÃ¦sars image crown'd, By silent sorrow all the people told In what a depth of woes their thoughts were drown'd, That bondage-bragging Comet to behold. What doe those scroules throwne in thy chaire import: Which, what thou art, to brave thy courage, brings? Be those the fancies of the vulgar sort? No, none but noble mindes dreame of great things; Of other Pretors people looke for showes, And distributions whose remembrance dyes, Whilst bloudy Fencers fall with mutuall blowes, And Africkes monsters doe amaze their eyes; But from thy hands they liberty attend, (By birth-right due) the glory of thy race, And bent for thee, their bloud will frankely spend, So thou succeed in thy great Parents place. He (Rome redeeming) Tarquin did o'rethrow, Though from his birth obey'd, and without strife; A rising tyrant then bring boldly low, To what extinguish'd was, who would give life. Brut. I weigh thy words with an afflicted heart, Which for compassion of my Country bleeds: And would to God that I might onely smart, So that all others scap'd what mischiefe breeds; Then, never man himselfe from death did free, With a more quiet and contented minde, Then I would perish, if I both could be To CÃ¦sar thankefull, to my Country kinde: But though that great mans grace to me enlarg'd, May chalenge right in my affections store, Yet must the greatest debt be first discharg'd, I owe him much, but to my Country more. This in my brest hath great dissension bred: I CÃ¦sar love, but yet Romes enemy hate, And as Iove lives, I could be mov'd to shed My bloud for CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sars for the State. I for my fathers death loath'd Pompey long, Whilst just disdaine did boyle within my brest: Yet when he warr'd to venge the common wrong, I joyn'd with him, because his cause was best. A minde to raigne if CÃ¦sar now reveale, I will in time precipitate his end: Thus (never arm'd but for the Common-weale) I help'd a foe, and now must hurt a friend. Cas. Lest of his favour thou the poyson prove, From swallowing of such baites in time now spare, âNo tyrant (trust me) can intirely love, âNor none who for himselfe doth onely care: He by this course doth cunningly intend (Thy vertue slack'd) to undermine thy minde: Thy well-knowne courage purpos'd to disbend, Thus (though with silken bonds) he would thee binde; This of each tyrant is the common tread, To wreake all those in whom most worth he findes; Or (whilst that terrours tosse his jealous head) By subtilty to snare the greatest mindes: As, for the Pretor-ship when we did strive, Then both were held in hope, that so deceiv'd, Each th'others harmes might study to contrive Through emulation and disdaine conceiv'd. Thus subtile CÃ¦sar by such sleights hath toild To sow dissension, that we both might pause Of private wrongs, and (by such meanes imbroil'd) Still courting him, neglect the common cause. But nought must make us th' one t' another strange, Who should in time the tyrants course restraine: Let other men lament, we must revenge, I scorne to beare a sword, and to complaine. Brut. Though CÃ¦sar (now) I must conspire thy fall, My heart to thee yet never harbour'd hate; But (pardon me) who ever make it thrall, From bondage Brutus must redeeme the state. Of this my course what ever others judge, Here, I protest it is for good design'd; My thoughts are guilty of no private grudge, For, reason and not fury moves my minde; Nor doth ambition now enflame my brest, With a prodigious appetite to raigne, That when I have made CÃ¦sar Pluto's guest, I in his roome a Monarch may remaine: No, if that glory did my fancies charme, To which (blind-folded) tyrants doe aspire, I needed not to doe, nor suffer harme, But with lesse paine might compasse my desire: For, if I would but temporize a space, Till time or death diminish CÃ¦sars might, He thinkes that I deserve to have his place, And I could make my day succeed his night; Yet doe I not for glory seeke so much As to attaine it by my Countries shame: But, O! I would (my zeale to it is such) That it may scape, incurre a kinde of blame. Yea, so that I may free with honour'd wounds My soile that's dearer then my soule to me, I could my selfe live banish'd from that bounds, Which at so deare a rate I would set free. Cas. What man doth breath of Mars his martiall race, But will with Brutus sacrifize his bloud, And (charg'd with Armes) ere tyranny take place, Dare venture all things for his Countries good, Can any judgement be deceiv'd so farre, But it already clearely may behold, How that this change Romes greatnesse soon will marre, And raze the Trophees which she rear'd of old. Of old in Rome, all those who once had worne The peace-importing gowne, or war-like shield, (Of dignities as capable all borne,) Durst ayme at ought that liberty could yeeld; Those in affaires to deale, who would set forth; Were not discourag'd by their birth, though base; And poverty could not hold backe true worth, From having honour both by warre and peace: Then emulation violently driv'd All gallant mindes to tempt great actions still; In vertues love, who friendly rivals liv'd, Whilst in their bosomes Glory balme did still: Fabricius first was from the Plow advanc'd, The Rudder of the Common-weale to hold, Yet by no meanes his private wealth enhanc'd, As rich in vertue still, as poore in gold. Rude Marius too, to match red Mars in fame, Forth from the vulgar drosse his race remov'd, And loe, of Cicero the ridiculous name, As famous as the Fabians now hath prov'd. Each abject minde disdain'd to be obscure, When still preferment follow'd lofty cares, And that one might by dangers past, procure Fame for himselfe, and honour to his heires: But since that state by CÃ¦sar is o're-turn'd, Whilst all our lives upon ones lippes depend, Of brests which once with love of glory burn'd, The soaring thoughts this wholly doth disbend; Advancement now doth not attend desert, But flowes from fancies of a flatt'red minde; Which to base hirelings, honour doth impart, Whilst envy'd worth no safe retreat can finde. âAll proud usurpers most addicted prove, âTo them whom without cause they raise too high, âAs thinking those who stand but by their love, âTo entertaine the same, all meanes must try. âWhere they, whose vertue reapes a due reward, âNot building onely on the givers grace, âDoe by deserts not gaine so great regard, âVVhilst they maintaine, as they obtaine their place. âAnd if a worthy man to worke great things, âVVing'd with a tyrants favour, raise his flight, âThe highest course to him most harme still brings, âVVho till he fall, cannot have leave to light. âThose who by force would have th'affection mov'd, âWhen willingly men hold such gallants deare, âDoe rage that any should be freely lov'd, âWhose vertue makes their vice more vile appeare. The man who now to be preferr'd aspires, Must by base flattery in a servile forme, So soothing CÃ¦sar, seale all his desires, And in some shadow lurke to scape a storme. A number now of that proud Rebels foes, Who grieve to see the ground whence growes their griefe, Would in obscurity entombe their woes, So waiting, and not working for reliefe. But we whose lofty mindes disdaine to lowre, Like them who seeke but their owne safety thus; When shall we use high indignations pow'r, Which (as brave Romans) worthy is of us? Brut, Since no indignity you will endure, I see our mindes doe sympathize in this; Should we by suff'ring, seek to live secure, Whose action must amend what is amisse? No, no such abject thought must staine our brest, Whose active thoughts reach further than discourse, Whilst but like beasts, affecting food and rest, Where men by reason should direct their course; Like those of other parts, not rais'd by strife, If CÃ¦sar had been born, or chus'd our Prince, Then those who durst attempt to take his life, The world of treason justly might convince. Let still the States which flourish for the time, By subjects be inviolable thought, And those (no doubt) commit a monstrous crime, Who lawfull Soveraignty prophane in ought: And we must thinke (though now thus brought to bow) The Senate King; a subject CÃ¦sar is; The Soveraignty whom violating now, The world must damne, as having done amisse. We will (deare Cassius) for our Countries sake, (What ever follow) give, or suffer death, And let us now advise what course to take, Whilst nought but th'ayre can beare away our breath. Cas. I thinke this matter needs not many words, Since but one deed can bound the common shame; In CÃ¦sars body we must sheath our swords, And by his death our liberty reclaime; But since his fortune did confound them all, Who in the fields to match him did begin; VVhilst he by thousands made their bands to fall, VVith hoary legions alwayes us'd to winne: As Pompeys, Scipio's, and Petreius ghosts, In lightlesse shades can by experience tell, Who after fatall proofes of num'rous hoasts, All famous (though infortunately, fell:) And since (provided for the Parthian warre) His Armie arm'd attends on his decree, Where we (sequestred from such forces farre) Would (if suspected) soone prevented be: With some few friends whom all things to assay, A love to us, or to their Country bindes, We to his wreake must walke another way, Whilst, ere our tongues, our hands doe tell our mindes: Now when most high, and therefore hated most, The gathered Senate seeks to make him King, We must goe give the blow before we boast, And him to death, Rome out of bondage bring. Brut. In all this course I onely one thing blame, That we should steale, what we may justly take, By cloathing honour with a cloake of shame, Which may our cause (though good) more odious make. O! I could wish with honourable wounds To match Romes enemy in the battels dust: No sweeter Musicke then the Trumpets sounds, When right and valour keepe a consort just: Then, free if quicke, else dead, no harme more fear'd, I alwayes so contentment might attaine; What tombe to men more glorious can be rear'd, Then mountaines made of foes whom they have slaine? But how are my transported thoughts growne such, That they disdaine a measure to admit? Whilst (bent not what to doe, but to doe much) On Glories Throne, Ambition strives to sit. No, to the State me from my selfe I give, Free from particulars, as who expose Fame, life, and all for it, and whilst I live, So Rome may gaine, I care not what I lose. I'le never rest till he for ever rest, Who gives my Country such a cause of griefe: And that to doe no forme I will detest, Nor for my fame endanger Romes reliefe: But (worthy Cassius) ere we further doe, Let our friends mindes first well be understood, Of which I hope to have assistance too, Who will not venture for his Countries good? Cas. Now whilst my soule rests ravish'd in a trance, I thinke I see great Rome her courage raise, Then beat the ayre with songs, th'earth with a dance, And crowne thy vertues with deserved praise. Scene 2. Marcus Brutus, Portia. My dearest halfe, my comfort, my delight, Of whom one smyle may sweeten all my sow'rs: Thou in my bosome us'd to powre thy spright, And where I was didst spare afflictions pow'rs. When broils domesticke did disturbe thy rest, Then still (till finding) faining some reliefe; Thou with calme words disguis'd a stormy brest, Ioyes frankly sharing, and engrossing griefe; Still tend'ring me with a respective care, What might offend, was by no meanes made knowne: But (with loves colours all things painted faire) What might have made me glad, was gladly showne. How com'st thou then thy courage thus to lose, That thou canst look so sad, and in my sight? Lend me (deare Love) a portion of thy woes; âA burden (when divided) doth grow light; I see the Roses fading in thy face, The Lilies languish, Violets take their place. Port. Thou hast (deare Lord) prevented my designe, Which was to aske of thee, what makes me pale; If PhÅbus had no light, could PhÅbe shine? No, with the cause of force th'effects must faile. The mirrour but gives backe as it receives, By just resemblance the objected forme, And what impression the ingraver leaves, The waxe retains, still to the stamp conforme. I am the mirrour which reflects thy minde, As forc'd from thoughts, or flowing from thine eyes; I take the state in which thy state I finde; Such is my colour as thy count'nance dyes. Then how can I rejoyce, whil'st thou art sad, Whose breast of all thy crosses is the scroule? I am still as thou art, if griev'd, or glad, Thy bodies shadow, th'essence of thy soule: On that great Planet which divides the yeares, Of fields inferiour as the fruit depends, And as it vanish doth, or pleas'd appeares, In th'earths cold bosome, life begins, or ends; Sunne of my soule, so I subsist by thee, Whose shining vertue leades me as a thrall: From care-bred clouds if that thy face be free, I rise in joyes, but if thou faint, I fall. Brut. With all my course this count'nance best accords, Who as you know, yet never from my birth, Light gestures us'd, nor did delight in words, Whose pleasant straines were onely tun'd to mirth. My melancholy Nature feeds on cares, Whil'st smothred sorrow by a habite smokes: âA thought-full breast (when burden'd with affaires) âDoth make a silent mouth, and speaking looks; As for my palenesse, it imports but good: âThe bodies humbling doth exalt the minde, Where fatnesse (come from food) but serves for food: In fattest bodies, leanest sprits we finde. Ah! since I saw th'abhorr'd Thessalia's bounds, All drench'd with bloud of Senatours and Kings, (As if my soule yet smarted in their wounds) A secret sorrow often-times me stings: But since thy Father (braving paine with blows) In the most hideous forme affronted death, To him my minde a sad remembrance owes, Which sorrow shall exact whil'st I have breath; Yet grieve I that I gave thee cause of griefe, Who thoughtst some new mishap did me dismay; To such old sores one worst can give reliefe; But Time in end may weare my woes away. Por. Why should'st thou so from me thy thoughts conceale? From thine own soule between whose breasts thou sleep'st, To whom (though showne) thou dost them not reveale, But in thy selfe more inwardly them keep'st? And thou canst hardly hide thy selfe from me, Who soone in thee each alteration spie, I can comment on all that comes from thee: âTrue love still looks with a suspitious eye: Within our bosome rests not every thought, Tun'd by a sympathie of mutuall love? Thou marr'st the Musicke if thou change in ought, Which (when distemper'd) I do quickly prove. Soule of my soule, unfold what is amisse, Some great disaster all my thoughts divine, Whose curiousnesse may be excus'd in this, Since it concerns thy State, and therefore mine. Brut. I wonder that thou dost thy frailtie show! âBy Nature women have beene curious still, And yet till now thou never crav'd to know More then I pleas'd to speak of my free will. âNought save the wife a man within the walls, âNor ought save him without she should embrace: âAnd it not comely is, but th'one enthralls, âWhen any sexe usurpes anothers place. Deare, to their wonted course thy cares inure, I may have matters which import the State, Whose op'ning up might my disgrace procure, Whose weight for femall thoughts would be too great. Port. I was not (Brutus) match'd with thee, to be A partner onely of thy boord, and bed: Each servile whore in those might equall me, Who but for pleasure, or for wealth did wed. No, Portia spous'd thee minding to remaine Thy Fortunes partner, whether good or ill: âBy loves strict bonds whil'st mutuall duties chaine, âTwo breasts must hold one heart, two souls one will; âThose whom just Hymen voluntar'ly bindes, âBetwixt them should communicate all things, âBut chiefly that which most doth move the mindes, âWhence either pleasure, or displeasure springs. If thus thou seek thy sorrows to conceale Through a disdaine, or a mistrust of me, Then to the world what way can I reveale, How great a matter I would do for thee? And though our sexe too talkative be deem'd, As those whose tongues import our greatest pow'rs, For secrets still bad Treasurers esteem'd, Of others greedy, prodigall of ours; âGood education may reforme defects, And this may leade me to a vertuous life, (Whil'st such rare patterns generous worth respects) I Cato's daughter am, and Brutus wife. Yet would I not repose my trust in ought, Still thinking that thy crosse was great to beare, Till I my courage to a tryall brought, Which suffering for thy cause can nothing feare: For first to try how that I could comport Which sterne afflictions sprit-enfeebling blows, Ere I would seek to vex thee in this sort, To whom my soule a dutious reverence owes. Loe, here a wound which makes me not to smart, No, I rejoyce that thus my strength is knowne: Since thy distresse strikes deeper in my heart, Thy griefe (lifes joy) makes me neglect mine owne. Brut. Thou must (deare love) that which thou sought'st receive, Thy heart so high a saile in stormes still beares, That thy great courage doth deserve to have Our enterprise entrusted to thine eares; This magnanimitie prevailes so farre, That it my resolution must controule, And of my bosome doth the depths unbarre, To lodge thee in the centre of my soule. Thou seest in what estate the State now stands, Of whose strong pillars CÃ¦sar spoyl'd the best, Whil'st by his owne, preventing others hands, Our famous Father fell amongst the rest. That proud usurper fondly doth presume To re-erect detested Tarquins throne, Thus the worlds Mistresse all-commanding Rome, Must entertaine no Minion now but one. All those brave mindes who mark where he doth tend, Swell with disdaine, their Countries scorne to see; And I am one of those who soone intend (His death or mine procur'd) to be made free. Port. And without me, canst thou resolve so soone, To try the danger of a doubtfull strife? As if despair'd, and alwayes but undone, Of me growne weary, weary of thy life. Yet since thou thus thy rash designe hast showne, Leave Portia's portion, venter not her part, Endanger nought but that which is thine owne, Go where thou lik'st, I will hold still thy heart. But lest by holding of thy best part back, The other perish't, aggravate my grones: Who would be so thought guilty of thy wrack, Take all thy Treasure to the Seas at once. Like Asia's Monarchs wife, who with short haires, (Sad signes of bondage) past still where he past, To weare away, or beare away thy cares, I'le follow thee, and of thy fortune taste. These hands which were with mine own bloud imbru'd, To strike another, may more strength afford, At least when thou by th'enemies art pursu'd, I'le set my selfe betwixt thee and each Sword; But if too great a priviledge I claime, Whose actions all should be dispos'd by thee, Ah! pardon (Brutus) and but onely blame This streame of passions that transported me. Brut. Thou ask'st what thou shouldst give, forgive deare Mate, This ventrous course of mine, which must have place, Though it make Fortune Tyrant of our State, Whose fickle foot-steps Vertue grieves to trace. And wonder not though thus to thee I prove, Since private duties now all pow'r have lost; I weigh not glory, profit, pleasure, love, Nor what respect may now import me most: So to the land of which I hold my life, I may performe that worke which I intend, Let me be call'd unkinde unto my wife: Yea, worst of all, ingrate unto my friend. âAs an instinct by Nature makes us know, âThere are degrees of duty to be past, âOf which the first unto the Gods we owe, âThe next t'our Countrey, to our friends the last. From Rome of old proud Tyrants bent to drive, Did th'author of my race with ardent zeale, Make those to dye, whom he had made to live, And spoil'd himselfe to raise the Common-weale? To settle that which CÃ¦sar now o're-throws, (Though vertues nurserie, stately whil'st it stood) He with the Tyrant inter-changing blows, On Glories Altar offered Fame his bloud. And did that man to crosse the common foe, Then damne his Sonnes to death? and with dry eyes, And is his speciall heire degener'd so, In abject bondage that he basely lyes? No, his posterity his name not staines, But even to tread his steps doth fast draw neare; Yet, of his sprit in us some spark remaines, Who more then life, our liberty hold deare. Port. Then prosecute thy course, for I protest, Though with some griefe, my soule the same approves; This resolution doth become thy brest, In honours spheare where heavenly Vertue moves: And do this enterprise no more deferre, What thee contents, to me contentment brings, I to my life thy safety do preferre, But hold thy honour deare above all things. It would but let the world my weaknesse see, If I sought my delights, not thy desires, Though griefe it give, and threaten death to me, Go follow forth that which thy Fame requires. Though Nature, sexe, and education breed, No power in me, with such a purpose even, I must lend help to this intended deed, If vows and pray'rs may penetrate the heaven: But difficulties huge my fancie findes, Nought, save the successe, can defray my feare: âAh! Fortune alwayes frownes on worthy mindes, âAs hating all who trust in ought save her. Yet I despaire not but thou may'st prevaile, And by this course to ease my present grones, I this advantage have which cannot faile: Ile be a free-mans wife, or else be nones: For, if all prosper not as we pretend, And that the Heavens Romes bondage do decree, Straight with thy liberty my life shall end, Who have no comfort but what comes from thee; My Father hath me taught what way to dye, By which if hindred from encountring death, Some other meanes, I (though more strange) must try: For, after Brutus none shall seeme breathe. Brut. Thou for my cause all others earst didst leave, But now forsak'st thy selfe to joyne with me, âOre generous love no pow'r weake passions have, Against thy minde thou dost with mine agree. Ile (since by thee approv'd) securely go, And vilipend the dangers of this life: Heavens make my enterprise to prosper so, That I may once prove worthy such a wife: But ah! of all thy words those grieve me most, Which bragge me with the dating of thy dayes; What? though I in so good a cause were lost. âNone flies the fate which stablish'd for him stayes. Do not defraud the world of thy rare worth, But of thy Brutus the remembrance love; From this faire prison strive not to breake forth, Till first the fates have forc'd thee to remove. Port. The heavens (I feare) have our confusion sworn, Since this ill Age can with no good accord, Thou and my Father (ah!) should have beene borne, When Vertue was advanc'd, and Vice abhorr'd. Then, ere the light of Vertue was declin'd, Your worth had reverenc'd beene, not throwne away, Where now ye both have but in darknesse shin'd, As Starres by night, that had beene Sunnes by day. Brut. My treasure, strive to pacifie thy brest, Lest sorrows but sinistrously presage That which thou would'st not wish, and hope the best, Though Vertue now must act on Fortunes Stage. Exeunt. Chorus. Then liberty, of earthly things What more delights a generous brest? Which doth receive, And can conceive The matchlesse treasure that it brings; It making men securely rest, As all perceive, Doth none deceive, Whil'st from the same true courage springs, But fear'd for nought, doth what seemes best: âThen men are men, when they are all their owne, âNot, but by others badges when made knowne: Yet should we not mispending houres, A freedome seeke, as oft it falls, With an intent But to content These vaine delights, and appetites of ours; For, then but made farre greater thralls, We might repent As not still pent In stricter bounds by others pow'rs, Whil'st feare licentious thoughts appalls: âOf all the Tyrants that the world affords, âOnes owne affections are the fiercest Lords: As Libertines those onely live, Who (from the bands of vice set free) Vile thoughts cancell; And would excell In all that doth true glory give, From which when as no Tyrants be Them to repell, And to compell Their deeds against their thoughts to strive, They blest are in a high degree: âFor, such of fame the scrouls can hardly fill, âWhose wit is bounded by anothers will. Our Ancestors of old such prov'd, (Who Rome from Tarquines yoke redeem'd) They first obtain'd, And then maintain'd Their liberty so dearly lov'd; They from all things which odious seem'd (Though not constrain'd) Themselves restrain'd, And willingly all good approv'd, Bent to be much, yet well esteem'd; âAnd how could such but ayme at some great end, âWhom liberty did leade, Glory attend? They leading valorous legions forth, (Though wanting Kings) triumph'd o're Kings, And still aspir'd, By Mars inspir'd, To conquer all from South to North; Then leading fame their Eagles wings, They all acquir'd That was requir'd, To make them rare for rarest things, The world made witnesse of their worth: Thus those great mindes who domineer'd o're all, Did make themselves first free, then others thrall, But we who hold nought but their name, From that to which they in times gone Did high ascend, Must low descend, And bound their glory with our shame, Whil'st on an abject Tyrants Throne, We (base) attend, And do intend Vs for our fortune still to frame, Not it for us, and all for one: âAs liberty a courage doth impart, âSo bondage doth disbend, else breake the heart, Yet, O! who knows but Rome to grace Another Brutus may arise? Who may effect What we affect, And Tarquines steps make CÃ¦sar trace; Though seeming dangers to despise He doth suspect What we expect Which from his breast hath banish'd peace, Though fairely he his feares disguise: âOf Tyrants even the wrong, revenge affords, âAll feare but theirs, and they feare all mens swords.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scene 1. Decius Brutus Albinus, Marcus Brutus, Caius Cassius. Deare Cosin, Cassius did acquaint mine eares With a designe which toss'd my minde a space; âFor, when strange news, a strangers breath firstbeares, âOne should not straight to rash reports give place. I would not then discover what I thought, Lest he to trap my tongue, a snare had fram'd, Till first with thee I to conferre was brought, Whom he for Patron of his purpose nam'd. âOne should look well to whom his minde he leaves, âIn dangerous times when tales by walls are told, âMen make themselves unnecessar'ly slaves, âOf those to whom their secrets they unfold. Mar. Brut. As Cassius told thee, griev'd for Romes distresse, Which to our shame in bondage doth remaine, We straight intend what ever we professe, With CÃ¦sars bloud to wash away this staine. Though for this end a few sufficient are, To whom their vertue courage doth impart, Yet were we loth to wrong thy worth so farre, As of such glory to give thee no part. Since both this cause, yea, and thy name thee binde, In this adventrous band to be compris'd, There needs no Rhetoricke to raise thy minde, To do the thing which thou shouldst have devis'd. Dec. Brut. I thought no creature should my purpose know, But he whose int'rest promis'd mutuall cares: âOf those to whom one would his secret show, âNo greater pledge of trust then to know theirs; As when two meet whil'st mask'd (though most deare friends) With them (as strangers) no respect takes place, But straight when friend-ship one of them pretends, The other likewise doth un-cloud the face. So as thou first, I'le now at last be bold: My brest with the same birth long bigge hath gone, But I to others durst it not unfold, Nor yet attempt to compasse it alone; But since this course, at which I long did pause, On such great pillars now so strongly stands, Whose count'nance may give credit to a cause, It hath my heart, and it shall have my hands. Ca. Cass. To our designes propitious signes are sent, So that the Gods would give us courage thus: For, all who ever heard of our intent, Would willingly engage themselves with us: Let other men discourse of vertuous rites, Ours but by action onely should be showne: âBare speculation is but for such sprits âAs want of pow'r, or courage keeps unknowne. âIn those who vertue view, when crown'd with deeds, âThrough Glories glasse, whose beauties long have shin'd; âTo be embrac'd an high desire she breeds, âAs load-stones iron, so ravishing the minde: What though a number now in darknesse lyes, Who are too weak for matters of such weight? We who are eminent in all mens eyes, Let us still hold the height of honour straight. Mar. Brut. Earst (that our faction might be strengthned thus) I labour'd much to purchase all their pow'rs, Whom hate to CÃ¦sar, love to Rome, or us, Might make imbarke in those great hopes of ours; By sicknesse then imprison'd in his bed, Whil'st I Ligarius spy'd whom paines did pricke, When I had said with words that anguish bred: In what a time Ligarius art thou sick? He answer'd straight as I had Physicke brought, Or that he had imagin'd my designe. If worthie of thy selfe thou would'st do ought, Then Brutus I am whole, and wholly thine: Since he by CÃ¦sar was accus'd of late For taking Pompey's part, yet at this houre He (though absolv'd) doth still the Tyrant hate, Since once endanger'd by his lawlesse pow'r: Thus (of great sprits exasperating spites) Heaven of our course the progresse doth direct, One inspiration all our soules incites, Who have advis'dly sworne for one effect. Dec. Brut. So I with Cicero did conferre at length, Who (I perceive) the present state detests, And though old Age diminish'd hath his strength, In him a will to free his Countrey rests. Mar. Bru. That man whose love still to his countrey shin'd, Would willingly the common-wealth restore: Then he (I know) though he conceals his minde, None CÃ¦sar more dislikes, nor likes us more: Yet to his custody I'le not commit The secrets of our enterprise so soone: âMen may themselves be often-times not fit âTo do the things which they would wish were done. He still was timorous, and, by age growne worse, Might chance to lay our honour in the dust; âAll Cowards must inconstant be of force, âWith bold designes none fearfull breasts should trust. Then, some of ours would hold their hands still pure, Who (ere they be suspected) for a space, Amid'st the tumult may remaine secure, And with the people mediate our peace: But who then Tullius fitter for that turne, Whose eloquence is us'd to charme their eares? His banishment they in black Gownes did mourne, Whom all do honour for his worth and yeares. Cai. Cass. Those studious wits which have through dangers gone, âWould still be out, ere that they enter in: âWho muse of many things, resolve of none, âAnd (thinking of the end) cannot begin. âThe minde which looks no further then the eye, âAnd more to Nature trusts, then unto Art, âSuch doubtfull fortunes fittest is to try: âA furious actor for a desp'rat part. We have enow, and of the best degree, Whose hands unto their hearts, hearts t'us are true, And if that we seek moe, I feare we be To hide, too many, if disclos'd, too few; Let us advise with an industrious care (Now ere the Tyrant intercept our mindes) The time, the place, the manner, when, and where We should en-trust our Treasure to the windes; And since our states this doth in danger bring, Let every point be circumspectly weigh'd, âA circumstance, or an indifferent thing, âDoth oft marre all, when not with care conveigh'd. Mar. Brut. As for the time, none could be wish'd more fit, Then is the present to performe our vow, Since all the people must allow of it, By recent anguish mov'd extreamely now. When represented in his triumph past, Great Cato's mangled intrails made them weep, And desp'rat Scipio whil'st he leap't at last To seek a Sanctuary amidst the deep. Then all those great men whom in severall parts, Bent for Romes freedome, CÃ¦sar did o're-throw, Did by their pictures pierce the peoples hearts, And made a piteous (though a pompous) show; How could they but conceive a just disdaine To be upbraided in so strange a sort, Whil'st he who onely by their losse did gaine, Of their calamitie did make a sport? But yet his purpose grieves them most of all, Since that he strives to be proclaim'd a King: And not contents himselfe to make us thrall, But would even all our heires to bondage bring. Thus whil'st the people are with him displeas'd, We best may do what to our part belongs: For, after this they may be best appeas'd, If, whil'st their wrath doth last, we venge their wrongs; And (since we nought intend but what is right, Whil'st from our Countrey we remove disgrace) Let all be acted in the Senates sight, A common cause, and in a common place. Let those whose guilty thoughts do damne their deeds, In corners like Minerva's birds abide, That which our Countrey good, us glory breeds, May by the lights of heaven and earth be try'd. The Senatours by our example mov'd, Pleas'd with this action which imports them too, To have the yoke of tyranny remov'd, May at the least confirme that which we do; So all the Senatours were said of old, King Romulus in peeces to have torne, Who then to tyrannize was growne too bold, And, ere turn'd God, humanitie did scorne. Dec. Brut. Yea, what though CÃ¦sar were immortall made, As Romulus, whose deitie him revives? I rather as a God adore him dead, Then as a King obey him whil'st he lives. Cai. Cass. That place indeed, most for our glory makes, A Theater worthy of so great an act, Where in their sight from whom most pow'r he takes, We of the Tyrant vengeance may exact; But I must recommend unto your minde, A course (though strict) of which we must allow, Lest it o're-throw all that we have design'd, Since past recovery, if neglected now: There is Antonius, CÃ¦sars greatest friend, A man whose Nature tyranny affects, Whom all the Souldiers daily do attend, As one who nought but to command respects; I feare that he when we have CÃ¦sar slaine, The grieved faction furnish with a head: So when we end, we must begin againe With one who lives worse then the other dead; And in my judgement I would thinke it best, VVhen sacrific'd the proud usurper lyes, That this seditious enemy of rest Should fall with him, with whom he first did rise: Thus, of our liberty we now may lay A solid ground, which can be shak't by none: âThose of their purpose who a part delay, âTwo labours have, who might have had but one. Mar. Brut. I cannot (Cassius) condescend to kill (Thus from the path of justice to decline) One faultlesse yet, lest after he prove ill, So to prevent his guiltinesse by mine; No, no, that neither honest were, nor just, Which rigorous forme would but the world affright; Men by this meane, our meaning might mistrust, And for a little wrong damne all that's right: If we do onely kill the common foe, Our Countries zeale must then acquire due praise, But if (like Tyrants) fiercely raging so, We will be thought that which we raze to raise; And where we but intend to aide the State, Though by endangering what we hold most deare, If slaying him (as arm'd by private hate) We to the world all partiall will appeare, Ah, ah! we must but too much murder see, Who without doing ill cannot do good: And, would the Gods, that Rome could be made free Without the shedding of one drop of bloud! Then, there is hope that Anthonie in end, Whil'st first our vertue doth direct the way, Will (leagu'd with us) the liberty defend, And (when brought back) will blush, as once astray. Ca. Cass. Well Brutus, I protest against my will, From this black cloud, what ever tempest fall, That mercy but most cruelly doth kill, Which thus saves one, who once may plague us all. Dec. Brut. When CÃ¦sar with the Senatours sits downe, In this your judgements generally accord, That for affecting wrongfully the Crowne, He lawfully may perish by the Sword: No greater harme can for our course be wrought, Then by protracting the appointed time, Lest that, which acted would be vertue thought, Be (if prevented) constru'd as a crime; Can one thing long in many mindes be pent? âNo, purposes would never be delayd, âWhich judg'd by th'issues Fortune doth comment, âIf prosp'ring, reason, treason if betrai'd. There may amongst our selves some man remaine, Whom (if afraid) his pardon to procure, Or (if too greedy) for the hope of gaine, Time to disclose his consorts may allure. Then for our recompence we ruine reape, If ought our course thus made abortive marre, For, if discovered once, we cannot scape: âAs tyrants eares heare much, their hands reach farre. Ca. Cassius. The brest in which so deep a secret dwels, Would not be long charg'd with so weighty cares: For, I conjecture, as their count'nance tels, That many know our mindes, though we not theirs: Even but of late one, Casca came to see Who curious was to have our purpose knowne, And said to him, that which thou had'st from me, To me by Brutus hath at length been shown. Then LÃ¦na once came to us in like sort, And wish'd that our designe might prosper well; But yet to haste did earnestly exhort, Since others told what we refus'd to tell. Whilst strangers rest familiar with our minde, And ere we them, doe all our purpose spy, Make forward fast, or we will come behinde: âFame (wing'd with breath) doth violently flye. Mar. Brut. Their words but burst from tales uncertaine forth, For, whilst considering of their bondage thus, Of CÃ¦sars tyranny and of our worth, They thinke this should be done, and done by us. Such conjurations to confirme of old, Some drinking others blouds, swore on their swords, And cursing those who did their course unfold, Vs'd imprecations, execrable words; And yet, then this, though voluntar'ly vow'd, Free from all bonds, save that which vertue bindes, More constantly no course was ere allow'd, Till that the end must manifest our mindes. And since so many frankely keep their faith, What first intended to accomplish bent, No doubt in spight of fickle fortunes wrath, A happy successe shall our soules content. Might some few Thebans from the Spartans pride, By divers tyrants deaths redeem their Towne? And one Athenian who his vertue try'd, By thirty tyrants ruine, get renowne? And to the Greekes are we inferiours growne, That where they have so many tyrants spoil'd, There cannot one be by us all o'rethrowne, Whose state yet staggering may be soon imbroil'd? I am resolv'd, and with my thoughts decree, VVhat ever chance to come, or sweet, or sowre, I shall my soile from tyranny set free, Or then my selfe free from the tyrants pow'r. Dec. Brut. By Lepidus invited this last night, VVhilst CÃ¦sar went to suppe, and I with him, Of all deaths shapes to talke, we tooke delight, So at the table to beguile the time: And whilst our judgements all about were try'd, Straight CÃ¦sar, (as transported) to the rest, With a most sudden exclamation cry'd: O! of all deaths, unlook'd for death is best: It from our selves doth steale our selves so fast, That even the minde no fearefull forme can see, Then is the paine ere apprehended past; âSowre things ere tasted, would first swallowed be. The threatned destiny thus he divin'd: (It would appeare) divinely then inspir'd; For, now I hope that he shall shortly finde That forme of death which he himselfe desir'd. Cai. Cas. Whilst of our band the fury flames most hot, And that their will to end this worke is such, Lest CÃ¦sars absence disappoint the plot, Which would of some abate the courage much; It (Decius) were exceedingly well done, That to his lodging you addrest your way, Him by all meanes to further forward soone, Lest him some sudden chance may move to stay. Dec. Brut. There, where the Senate minds this day to sit, Stand all prepar'd, not fearing danger more, And for the Sacrifice when all is fit, I'le bring an offring hallowed of before. Exeunt. Scene 2. CÃ¦sar, Calphurnia, Decius Brutus. Long-lookt-for Time that should the glory yeeld, Which I through Neptunes trustlesse raign have sought; And through the dust of many a bloudy field, As by all dangers worthy to be bought. Thy comming now those lowring shadowes cleares, My hopes horizon which did long o're-cast; This day defrayes the toyles of many yeares, And brings the harvest of my labours past. The Senators a Messenger have sent Most earnestly entreating me to come And heare my selfe discern'd by their consent To weare a Crowne o're all, excepting Rome; Thus, they devise conditions at this houre For him, of whom Mars hath made them the prey, As Subjects limit could their Soveraignes pow'r, Who must have minde of nought but to obey; But having pacifi'd those present things, I minde to leade my valorous legions forth To th' orientall Realmes (adoring Kings) Who can afford all that is due to worth. Then swimme my thoughts in th' ocean of delight, Whilst on the pillow of soft praise repos'd; Those eyes to gaze upon my glories light, Which Envy open'd, Admiration clos'd. Cal. Ah, though your fancies great contentment finde, Whilst thus the world your vertue doth advance; Yet a prepost'rous terrour stings my minde, And braggs me with I know not what mischance; My wavering hopes o're-ballanc'd are with feares, Which to my soule sinistrous signes impart; And om'nous rumours so assault mine eares, That they almost make breaches in my heart. CÃ¦s. What? do foil'd Pompeys floting followers strive To recollect their ruines from the dust? Dare they who onely by my tollerance live, More to their strength, then to my favour trust? Or do'st thou feare his sonnes dejected state, Who steales infamous flying through those flouds, Which his great father, Admirall of late, Did plant with ships, till all their waves seem'd woods; Or makes his brothers death his hopes grow more, Since (by them straited in a bloudy strife) I who in all the battels given before, Did fight for victory, then, fought for life; Or, whilst to march to Parthia I prepare, Doth a suspition thus afflict thy sprite: By Crassus fortune mov'd, who perish'd there, The scorned prey of the Barbarians spight? To those with Cassius who from thence retir'd, Amongst my bands a place I will allow, Whose foes shall finde (bad fate at last expir'd,) Though the same sheep, another sheep-heard now; Doe not imagine matters to bemone, For, whilst there stands a world, can CÃ¦sar fall? Though thousand thousands were conjur'd in one, I, and my fortune might confound them all. Cal. No, none of those my minde doth miscontent, Who undisguis'd still like themselves remaine: Vnlook't-for harmes are hardest to prevent: There is no guard against conceal'd disdaine; But, in whom further can your trust repose, Whom danger now o're all by all attends? âWhere private men but onely feare their foes, âOft Kings have greatest cause to feare their friends, âFor, since most trusted, fittest to betray, âThose unto whom ones favour force affords, âMost dangerous ambushes with ease may lay, âWhilst falsest hearts are hid with fairest words. And some report (though privately) yet plaine, That Dolabella and Antonius now, By your destruction doe intend to gaine That which you keep by making all men bow. CÃ¦s. No corpulent sanguinians make me feare, Who with more paine their beards then th'en'mies strike, And doe themselves like th'Epicurians beare To Bacchus, Mars, and Venus borne alike; Their hearts doe alwaies in their mouthes remaine, As streames whose murmuring showes their course not deep, Then still they love to sport, though grosse, and plaine, And never dreame of ought but when they sleep: But those high sprites who hold their bodies downe, Whose visage leane their restlesse thoughts records: Whilst they their cares depth in their bosomes drown, I feare their silence more then th'others words. Thus Cassius now and Brutus seeme to hold Some great thing in their minde, whose fire oft smoaks; What Brutus would, he vehemently would: Thinke what they list, I like not their pale lookes: Yet with their worth this cannot well agree, In whom bright vertue seemes so much to shine: Can those who have receiv'd their lives from me, Prove so ingrate, that they doe thirst for mine? Dare CassÃ¯us (match'd with me) new hopes conceive, At th'Hellespont, who fortune durst not try, And (like a dastard) did his Gallies leave, In all (save courage) though more strong then I? Shall I suspect that Brutus seekes my bloud, Whose safety still I tendred with such care, Who when the heavens from mortals me seclude, Is onely worthy to be CÃ¦sars heire? Cal. âThe corners of the heart are hard to know; Though of those two the world the best doth deeme, Yet doe not trust too much to th' outward show, For, men may differ much from what they seeme. âNone oft more fierce then those who look most milde, âImpiety sometime appeares devout, And (that the world the more may be beguil'd) âEven vice can cloath it selfe with vertues cote. Though it would seem (all hatred now laid downe) They on your favour onely should depend, Yet no respect can counterpoise a Crowne: âAmbition hath no bounds, nor Greed no end. Mov'd by vindictive hate, or emulous pride, Since some your person, some your place pursue; All threatned dangers to prevent, provide, And use for safety, what to State is due. CÃ¦s. No armour is that can hold treason out. Cal. To fright your foes with bands be back'd about. CÃ¦s. So dastard tyrants strive themselves to beare. Cal. It better is to give, then to take feare. CÃ¦s. No guard more strong then is the peoples love. Cal. But nought in th'earth doth more inconstant prove. CÃ¦s. Guards (shewing feare) to charge me men might tempt. Cal. Guards would put them from hope, you from contempt. CÃ¦s. My brest from terrour hath been alwaies cleare. Cal. When one least feares, oft danger lurks most neare. CÃ¦s. I rather dye then feare: at last life goes. Cal. Yet, death must grieve, when forc'd by vaunting foes. CÃ¦s. I will not crosse my present pleasures so, By apprehending what may chance to come, This world affords but too much cause for woe; And sorrowes still must harbour'd be by some. By joyes in time we must embrace reliefe, That when they end, we in some measure may By their remembrance mitigate the griefe Which still attends all those on th'earth that stay. I thinke the Senate is assembled now, And for my comming doth begin to gaze, Let me condignely once adorne my brow, And feast mine eares by drinking in due praise. Cal. Stay, stay (deare Lord) retire thy steps againe, And spare a space to prorogate whole yeares; Let not this ominous day begin thy raigne, Which fatall and unfortunate appeares. An Astrologian through the world renown'd, Thy horoscopes just calculation layes, And doth affirme (as he by signes hath found) That Marches Ides doe bragge to bound thy dayes; Walke not abroad where harmes may be receiv'd (By great necessity since no way forc'd) For, (though his judgement may be farre deceiv'd) âIn things that touch thy life, suspect the worst. CÃ¦s. Whilst I reform'd the Calendar by fits, Which did confound the order of the yeare; I waded through the depths of all their wits, Who of the starres the mysteries would cleare. Those pregnant sprites who walke betwixt the Poles, And lodge at all the Zodiackes severall signes, Doe reade strange wonders wrapt in th'azure scroules, Of which our deeds are words, our lives are lines. By speculation of superiour pow'rs, Some Natures secrets curious are to know, As how celestiall bodies rule o're ours, And what their influence doth worke below. Yea, they sometime may brave conjectures make Of those whose parts they by their birth doe prove, Since naturally all inclination take From Planets then predominant above; And yet no certainty can so be had, Some vertuously against their Starres have striv'd, As Socrates, who grew (though borne but bad) The most accomplish'd man that ever liv'd. But of the houre ordain'd to close our lights, No earth-clog'd soule can to the knowledge come; For, O! the destinies farre from our sights, In clouds of darknesse have involv'd our doome! And some but onely guesse at great mens falls, By bearded Comets, and prodigious Starres, Whose sight-distracting shape the world appalls, As still denouncing terrour, death, or warres. The time uncertaine is of certaine death, And that fantasticke man farre past his bounds: âWith doubt and reverence they should manage breath, âWho will divine upon conjectur'd grounds. Cal. But this all day hath prey'd upon my heart, And from the same of cares a tribute claim'd; Doe not despise that which I must impart, Though but a dreame, and by a woman dream'd. I thought (alas) the thought yet wounds my breast, Then whilst we both (as those whom Morpheus weds) Lay softly buried (with a pleasant rest) I in thy bosome, thou within the beds: Then from my soule strange terrours did with-draw Th'expected peace by apprehended harmes; For, I imagin'd, no, no doubt I saw, And did embrace thee bloudy in mine armes. Thus whilst my soule by sorrowes was surcharg'd, Of which huge weight it yet some burden beares, I big with griefe, two Elements enlarg'd, Th' ayre with my sighes, the water with my teares. CÃ¦s. That which I heard, with thy report accords, Whilst thou all seem'd dissolv'd in griefe at once, A heavy murmuring made with mangled words, Was interrupted oft by tragicke grones. The memory, but not the judgement frames Those raving fancies which disturbe the braine, Whilst night dissolves all dayes designes in dreames, âThe senses sleeping, soules would stirre in vaine. From superstitious feares this care proceeds, Which still would watch o're that which thou dost love, And in thy minde thus melancholy breeds, Which doth those strange imaginations move. Cal. Ah, in so light account leave off to hold. Those fatall warnings, which our mindes should leade To search darke matters, till we may unfold What dangers huge doe hang above thy head. With sacred Garlands he who things divines, By th' intrails of the consecrated beast, Doth in the offring see sinistrous signes, And I entreat thee doe not hence make haste. CÃ¦s. When I in Spaine against yong Pompey went, Thus, the diviner threatned me before, Yet did I prosecute my first intent, Which with new lawrels did my browes decore. Cal. And yet you hardly there (as I doe heare) From danger (farre engag'd) redeem'd your life; But tokens now more monstrous doe appeare, And I suspect farre worse then open strife. CÃ¦s. Lest I too much seeme wedded to my will, (As others counsels scorning to allow) With jealous eyes I'le search about me still, And even mistrust my selfe to trust thee now; Yet if I stay, the Senators deceiv'd, May my beginning straight begin to hate; So might I perish, seeking to be sav'd: âBy flying it, some fall upon their fate. But here one comes who can resolve me much, With whom I use to weigh affaires of weight; Whence com'st thou Decius, that thy haste is such? Is ought occurr'd that craves our knowledge straight? Dec. I come to tell you how the Senate stayes, Till that your presence blesse their longing fight, And to conclude what is propos'd, delayes, Since your applause can onely make it right: They your contentment to procure intend, And all their thoughts seeme at one object bent, Save that amongst themselves they doe contend, Who you to please, shall rarest wayes invent. CÃ¦s. Then that, no treasure to my soule more deare, Which to enjoy from hence I long to part, But yet I know not what arrests me here, And makes my feet rebellious to my heart; From thee (deare friend) I never doe conceale The weightiest secrets that concerne me most; And at this time I likewise must reveale, How heavens by signes me with destruction boast: To superstition though not earst inclin'd, My wife by dreames doth now presage my fall, It a sooth-sayer likewise hath divin'd: The Sacrifice prodigious seemes to all, So that till this disastrous day be gone, All company I purpose to disuse, And to the Senators will send some one, To paint my absence with a faire excuse. Dec. Brut. Doe not repose on superstitious signes, You to suspect the people thus to bring, Whilst Soveraigne-like you limit their designes, Seeme not a tyrant, seeking to be King: How can we satisfie the worlds conceit, Whose tongue still in all eares your praise proclaimes? Or shall we bid them leave to deale in state, Till that Calphurnia first have better dreames? If that this day you private would remaine, The Senate to dissolve your selfe must goe, And then incontinent come backe againe, When you have showne to it some reverence so. CÃ¦s. With thy advise (as pow'rfull) I agree, The Senatours shall have no cause to grudge: A little space, all part a space from me, And I'le be shortly ready to dislodge. CÃ¦sar alone. VVhence comes this huge and admirable change, That in my brest hath uncouth thoughts infus'd, Doth th'earth then earst yeeld terrors now more strange, Or but my minde lesse courage then it us'd? What spightfull fate against my state contends, That I must now to fancied plagues give place, By foes not mov'd, afraid amongst my friends, By warre secure, endanger'd but by peace? When strongest troopes to fight with me did come, Then did my heart the highest hopes conceive, I warr'd with many, many to o're-come; The greatest battels, greatest glory gave. As th'enemies numbers, still my courage grew; Through depths of dangers oft times have I past, Yet never did those boundlesse labours rue, To have none greater first, none equall last: When bragging Gauls mov'd by their neighbours fals, Had from the fields, no, from my fury fled; And hid themselves with Armes, their Armes with walles, Whilst I my troupes before Alexia led; Then, though there swarm'd forth from the bounds about, Huge hosts to compasse me enflam'd with wrath, That the besiegers (all besieg'd about,) Seem'd drawne by danger in the nets of death. No way I who could with the pride comport, That those Barbarians by vaine vaunts bewray'd, Did re-assault th' assaulters in such sort, That words by wounds, wounds were by death repayd. Of those within the towne (to ease their toyles) Till quite o're-com'd, their comming was not knowne, Who straight (upbraided by the barb'rous spoiles) Did yeeld themselves, as if with them o're-throwne, By liquid legions whilst with tumid boasts The Trident-bearer striv'd my spoiles to beare; Though threatned thrise amid'st his humid hosts, Still courage scorn'd to thinke of abject feare. I us'd those Pyrats who had me deceiv'd, Still as my servants (thundring threatnings forth) And gave them money more then they had crav'd, Whose ignorance too meanely priz'd my worth: Yet gathering ships, I stay'd not long a shore, But trac'd their steps, though they not pav'd the way, And taking them (as I had vow'd before) By nought but death their ransome would defray; Then when (without th'advice of others mindes) Through hoary waves I past alone by night, Whilst in a little Barke against great windes, That even the Pilot look't not for the light; The waves themselves asunder seem'd to teare, That in their gravell I might chuse a grave, And crystall arches did above me reare, That I a Tombe fit for my state might have. Whilst dangers seem'd to merit CÃ¦sars death, As Neptune rais'd his head, I rais'd my heart; And shewing what I was with constant breath, To weake Amiclas courage did impart. Was I not once amid'st large Nilus slote, Whilst me to wound, a wood of darts did flye, Yet swim'd so carelesse of my enemies shot, That in my hand I held some papers dry? With open dangers thus in every place, I (whilst oft compass'd both by Sea and Land,) Did undismay'd looke horrour in the face, As borne for nought, but onely to command. But since a world of victories have fill'd With Trophees Temples, Theaters with my praise, That bath'd with balme which glories bayes had still'd, With friends in peace, I look'd to spend my dayes; The chambers musicke now afrights me more, Then Trumpets sounds when marching in the field, And Gowns (though signes of peace) worse then before The pompous splendour of a flaming shield. Those thoughts of late which had disdain'd to doubt, Though I alone had march'd amongst my foes, Loe, whilst amongst my friends well back'd about, They, then the eyes more danger now disclose. If any chance, to meet a number brings, I insurrections feare from common wrath, Yea, if two talke a part of private things, Straight I suspect that they conspire my death; When sudden rumours rise from vulgar smoake; (Whilst th'inward motions roule my restlesse eyes,) I at each corner for an ambush looke, And start astonish'd, lest some tumult rise. When light (first lightning) doth encourage toyles, I still despaire to re-enjoy the night, And when mine eyes th' umbragious darkenesse spoils, I never looke to grace them with the light; For, when the light with shadowes makes a change, To flatter mortals with a dreame of rest, What ugly Gorgons, what Chimera's strange Doe bragge the little world within my brest? The time which should appease impetuous cares, Doth double mine, who view most when quite blinde; I apprehend huge horrours and despaires, Whilst th' outward objects not distract my minde: Now of my conquests what delight remaines? Where is the peace pursu'd by many a strife? Have I but taken paine to purchase paines? And sought by dangers for a dangerous life? Is this the period of aspiring pow'rs, In promis'd calmes to be most plagu'd by stormes? Lurke poys'nous Serpents under fairest flow'rs, And hellish furies under heavenly formes? It will not grieve my ghost below to goe, If circumvented in the warres I end, As bold Marcellus by Romes greatest foe, Who gave his ashes honour as a friend; Or like t' Epaminondas in his death, O! would the Gods I had amidst alarmes, When charg'd with recent spoiles, been spoil'd of breath, Whilst I to Pluto might have march'd in armes; Yet, life to end, which nought but toyles affords, I'le pay to death the tribute that it owes; Straight with my bloud, let some come dye their swords, Whose naked brest encounter shall their blowes: But ah! how have the furies seaz'd my brest, And poyson'd thus my sprite with desp'rate rage? By horrid Serpents whilst quite barr'd from rest, No kinde of comfort can my cares asswage; No, Atropos, yet spare my threed a space, That to the Stygian streames ere walking downe, I may of honour have the highest place, And if I fall, yet fall beneath a Crowne. VVhilst eares are bended to applauding shouts, My thoughts divided are within my brest, And my toss'd soule doth flote between two doubts, Yet knowes not on what ground to build her rest. The Senators, they have this day design'd, To shew the world how they esteeme my worth; Yet doe portentuous signes perturbe my minde, By which the heavens would point my danger forth: The Gods from me with indignation gone, In every thing charact'red have my death: And must both heaven and earth conspire in one, To quench a little sparke of smoaking breath? My safety would that I should stay within Till this disastrous day give darkenesse place, But daring honour would have me begin To reape the glory of my painefull race, And I'le advance in spight of threatned broyles, For, though the fates accomplish what we dreame, When onely death hath triumph'd of my spoyles, I then (though breathlesse) still shall breathe with fame. Exit. Chorus. VVhat fury thus doth fill the brest With a prodigious rash desire, Which banishing their soules from rest, Doth make them liue who high aspire, (Whilst it within their bosome boyles) As Salamanders in the fire; Or like to Serpents changing spoyles, Their wither'd beauties to renew? Like Vipers with unnaturall toyles, Of such the thoughts themselves pursue, Who for all lines their lives doe square, Whilst like Camelions changing hue, They onely feed on empty ayre: âTo passe ambition greatest matters brings, âAnd (save contentment) can attaine all things. This active passion doth disdaine To match with any vulgar minde, As in base breasts where terrours raigne, Too great a guest to be confin'd; It doth but lofty thoughts frequent, Where it a spatious field may finde, It selfe with honour to content, Where reverenc'd fame doth lowdest sound; Those for great things by courage bent, (Farre lifted from this lumpish rÃ¶und) Would in the sphere of Glory move, Whilst lofty thoughts which nought can binde, All rivals live in vertues love; âOn abject preyes as th' Eagles never light, âAmbition poysons but the greatest sprite, And of this restlesse Vultures brood, (If not become too great a flame) A little sparke doth sometime good, Which makes great mindes (affecting fame) To suffer still all kinde of paine: Their fortune at the bloudy game, Who hazard would for hope of gaine, Vnlesse first burn'd by thirst of praise? The learned to a higher straine, Their wits by emulation raise, As those who hold applauses deare; And what great minde at which men gaze, It selfe can of ambition cleare, Which is when valu'd at the highest price, A generous errour, an heroicke vice? But when this frenzie flaming bright, Doth so the soules of some surprise, That they can taste of no delight, But what from Soveraignty doth rise, Then, huge affliction it affords; Such must (themselves so to disguise) Prove prodigall of courteous words, Give much to some, and promise all, Then humble seeme to be made Lords, Yea, being thus to many thrall, Must words impart, if not support; To those who crush'd by fortune fall; And grieve themselves to please each sort: âAre not those wretch'd, who o're a dangerous snare, âDo hang by hopes, whilst ballanc'd in the ayre; Then when they have the Port attain'd, Which was through Seas of dangers sought, They (loe) at last but losse have gain'd, And by great trouble, trouble bought: Their mindes are married still with feares, To bring forth many a jealous thought; With searching eyes, and watching eares, To learne that which it grieves to know, The brest that such a burden beares, What huge afflictions doe o'rethrow? Thus, each Prince is (as all perceive) No more exalted then brought low, âOf many, Lord, of many, slave; âThat idoll greatnesse which th'earth doth adore, âIs gotten with great paine, and kept with more: He who to this imagin'd good, Did through his countries bowels tend, Neglecting friendship, duty, bloud, And all on which trust can depend, Or by which love could be conceiv'd, Doth finde of what he did attend, His expectations farre deceiv'd; For, since suspecting secret snares, His soule hath still of rest beene reav'd, Whilst squadrens of tumultuous cares, Forth from his brest extort deep grones: Thus CÃ¦sar now of life despaires, Whose lot his hope exceeded once; And who can long well keep an ill wonne State? âThose perish must by some whom all men hate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Scene 1. Marcus Brutus, Chorus, Antonius, Caius Cassius, Marcus Tullius Cicero. Are generous Romans so degener'd now, That they from honour have estrang'd their hands? And, us'd with burdens, do not blush to bow, Yea (even though broken) shake not off their bands; This glorious worke was worthy of your paine, Which now ye may by others dangers have; But what enchaunts you thus, that ye abstaine That which ye should have taken, to receive? Where be those inundations of delight, Which should burst out from thoughts o're-flow'd with joy, Whil'st emulous Vertue may your mindes incite, That which we give you bravely to enjoy, Or quite conform'd unto your former state, Do still your mindes of servitude allow, As broken by adversitie of late, Not capable of better fortune now? Loe, we who by the Tyrants favour stood, And griev'd but at the yoke which you out-rag'd, Have our advancement, riches, rest, and bloud, All liberally for liberty engag'd. Chor. Thou like thy great Progenitour in this, Hast glory to thy selfe, t'us freedome brought; âThen liberty what greater treasure is? âOught with it much, without it much seemes nought: But pardon us (heroicke man) though we To high perfection hardly can aspire, Though every man cannot a Brutus be, âWhat none can imitate, all must admire. At this strange course (with too much light made blinde) We our opinions must suspend a space, âWhen sudden chances do dismay the minde, âThe Iudgement to the Passion first gives place. Ant. What wonder now though this most barbarous deed Have with amazement clos'd your judgement in, Which O (I feare) shall great confusion breed? When CÃ¦sars toyls did end, Romes did begin: The most suspitious mindes had not beleev'd, That Romans reverenc'd for their worth by us, Would have presum'd to kill, or to have griev'd An hallow'd body inhumanely thus; Who would have once but dream'd of such despight? What strange hostilitie! in time of peace To kill, though not accus'd, against all right, A sacred man, and in a sacred place? Cai. Cass. If CÃ¦sar as a Citizen had liv'd, And had by Law decided every strife, Then I would grant those treason had contriv'd, Who went without a Law to take his life; But to pervert the Laws, subvert the State, If all his travels did directly tend, Then I must say, we did no wrong of late: âWhy should not Tyrants make a Tragicke end? Cho. Since destinies did CÃ¦sars soule enlarge, What course can we for his recovery take? Ah! th'unrelenting Charons restlesse Barge Stands to transport all o're, but brings none back: âOf lifes fraile glasse (when broken) with vaine grones, âWhat earthly power the ruines can repaire; âOr who can gather up, when scattred once, âOnes bloud from th'earth, or yet his breath from th'ayre? Let us of those who passe oblivions floud Oblivious be, since hope of help is gone, And spend our cares where cares may do most good, Lest Rome waile many, where she wailes but one. Ant. Still concord for the Common-weale were best, To reconcile divided thoughts againe: âThen discord to great Townes, no greater pest, Whose violence no reverence can restraine. Yet often-times those warie wits have err'd, Who would buy wealth and ease at any cost: âLet honesty to profit be preferr'd. âAnd to vile peace warre when it wounds us most; But seeking peace, what surety can we finde? Can faithlesse men give faith, just feares to stay? âNo sacred band Impiety can binde, âWhich sweares for trust, seeks trust but to betray; What help'd it CÃ¦sar, that we all had sworne His body still from dangers to redeeme? âThose who are once perjur'd, hold oaths in scorne? âAll are most franke of what they least esteeme. Mar. Brut. None needs in States which are from Tyrants free, Loath'd execrations to confirme his will, Where willingly men would with good agree, And without danger might despise all ill; All odious oaths by those are onely crav'd, Whose suit from Reason doth a warrant want, Whil'st who deceive (affraid to be deceiv'd) Seek of men thrall'd, what none whil'st free would grant. When CÃ¦sar had prevail'd in France and Spaine, His Fortune building on his Countries wracke, (Of liberty a shadow to retaine) We gave him all that he was bent to take. The Senate had reserv'd nought but a show, Whose course to it by CÃ¦sar was impos'd, Who lifted up, by bringing others low, Of Offices, and Provinces dispos'd: Then that our faded hopes might never spring, When bent to try the Parthians wooden showre, He for five yeares dispos'd of every thing, Even in his absence leaving us no pow'r. O how some aggravate our deed with hate! Who durst his body wound, or with bloud staine, Though consecrated by constraint of late, Yea, but reputed holy, yet prophaine, And did forget how he (a wondrous case) The Tribuneship did violate with scorne, Which our fore-fathers (free) in time of peace Advis'dly had inviolable sworne. Did he not once appropriate (swolne with wrath) The publike treasure to his private use? And to the Tribune boldly threatned death, Who did resist, griev'd at that great abuse. Twixt Romans and a Tyrant what availes A Covenant whil'st Right rests trod on thus? âWho can build further when the ground once fails? Could we save him who sought to ruine us? Cic. So absolutely good no man remaines, Whose naturall weaknesse may not him o're-come; âEven Vertues dye from Vice may take some staines, âAnd worthy minds may of grosse faults have some: âAs in fine fruits, or weeds, fat earth abounds, âEven as the Labourers spend, or spare their paine, âThe greatest sprits (disdaining vulgar bounds) âOf what they seek the highest height must gaine; âThey (that bright glory may be so enjoy'd) âAs onely borne to be in action still, âHad rather be (then idle) ill imploy'd: âGreat sprits must do great good, or then great ill; The worlds chiefe treasure which bright Rayes do arme, Huge evill procur'd (though onely fram'd for good) Till that fond youth whom his owne wish did harme, Was kill'd by fire, and buried in a floud. By rules of Reason whil'st he rightly liv'd, When lawfully elected by the State, What glorious deeds by CÃ¦sar were atchiev'd, Which all the world as wonders must relate? But when of right he buried all respects, (As blinde Ambition had bewitch'd his minde) What harme ensu'd, by pitifull effects, We at the first, he at the last did finde; Whil'st like Narcissus with himselfe in love, He with our bondage banqueted his sight, And for a while (uncertaine joyes to prove) VVith all our woes would sweeten his delight; How could brave men (with vertuous mindes) as those VVho of their Countries weale are jealous still, But stoutly to all stormes their States expose, The States destroyer resolute to kill? But since our freedome slows from CÃ¦sars bloud, Let us embrace that which too long we lack: âPeace gives to justice pow'r, it, to all good, âVVhere warre breeds wrong, and wrong all kinde of wracke. This Citie hath experienc'd with great paine, VVhat guilty troubles rise from civill strife, VVhich by her ruines registred remaine, Since first the Gracchi gave contention life. VVhen Scilla once, and Marius (mad through pride) Did strive who should the most tyrannicke prove, VVhat memorable miseries were try'd, From Romans mindes no time can e're remove? Then last by CÃ¦sar, and his Sonne in law, VVhat thousands Ghosts to Pluto were dispatch'd? Ah! that the world those hosts divided saw, Which, joyn'd in one, no world of worlds had match'd: Yet with this wit which we have dearly bought, Let us abhorre all that may breed such broils, Lest when we have our selves to ruine brought, In end Barbarians beare away our spoyls. Cho. Rome to those great men hardly can afford A recompence, according to their worth, Who (by a Tyrants o're-throw) have restor'd The light of liberty which was put forth; Yet (by due praises with their merits even) Let us acknowledge their illustrious mindes; And to their charge let Provinces be given: âStill vertue grows, when it preferrement findes. Ant. Those barbarous Realms by whose respective will, Of CÃ¦sars Conquests monuments are showne: As if they held them highly honour'd still, Who warr'd with CÃ¦sar though they were o'rethrown, Can this disgrace by their proud mindes be borne, Whil'st we dishonour, whom they honour thus? And shall we not (whil'st as a Tyrant torne) Give him a tombe, who gave the world to us? Must his Decrees be all reduc'd againe, And those degraded whom he grac'd of late, As worthy men unworthily did gaine Their roomes of reputation in the State? As if a Tyrant we him damne so soone, And for his murd'rers do rewards devise, Then what he did, must likewise be undone, For which I feare, a foule confusion rise. Cho. Ah! (brave Antonius) sow not seeds of warre, And if thou alwayes do'st delight in armes, The haughty Parthians yet undaunted are, Which may give thee great praise, and us no harmes. Detest in time th'abhominable broils, For which no Conquerour to triumph hath com'd, Whil'st this wretch'd Towne (which still some party spoils) Must loath the Victor, and lament th'o're-com'd: And shall we still contend against all good, To make the yoke where we should bound abide? Must still the Commons sacrifize their bloud, As onely borne to serve the great mens pride? Ant. Whil'st I the depths of my affection sound, And reade but th'obligations which I owe, I finde my selfe by oaths, and duty bound, All CÃ¦sars foes, or then my selfe t'ore-throw. But when I weigh what to the State belongs, The which to plague no passion shall get place, Then I with griefe digesting private wrongs, Warre with my selfe to give my Countrey peace. Yet whil'st my thoughts of this last purpose muse, I altogether dis-assent from this, That CÃ¦sars fame, or body we abuse, To deale with Tyrants as the custome is. Lest guilty of ingratitude we seeme, (If guerdoning our benefactors thus) Great CÃ¦sars body from disgrace redeeme, And let his acts be ratifi'd by us. Then for the publike-weale which makes us pause, Towards those that have him kill'd t'extend regard, Let them be pardon'd for their kinsmens cause: âRemission given for evill is a reward. Ca. Cass. We stand not vex'd like Malefactors here, With a dejected and remorsefull minde, So in your presence supplicants t'appeare, As who themselves of death do guilty finde; But looking boldly with a loftie brow, Through a delight of our designe conceiv'd, We come to challenge gratefulnesse of you, That have of us so great a good receiv'd. But if you will suspend your thoughts a space, Though not the givers, entertaine the gift; Do us reject, yet liberty embrace: To have you free (loe) that was all our drift. So Rome her ancient liberties enjoy, Let Brutus and let Cassius banish't live; Thus banishment would breed us greater joy, Then what at home a Tyrants wealth could give. Though some misconstrue may this course of ours, By ignorance, or then by hate deceiv'd; âThe truth depends not on opinions pow'rs, âBut is it selfe, how ever misconceiv'd. Though to acknowledge us, not one would daigne, Our merit of it selfe is a reward, âOf doing good none should repent their paine, âThough they get no reward, nor yet regard. I'le venture yet my fortune in the field, With every one that Rome to bondage draws; And as for me, how ever others yeeld, I'le nought obey, but Reason, and the Laws. Cic. What fools are those who further travell take, For that which they even past recovery know? Who can revive the dead, or bring time back? That can no creature who doth live below. Great Pompey (now) for whom the world still weeps, Lyes low, neglected on a barbarous shore; Selfe-slaughtered Scipio flotes amidst the deeps, Whom, it may be, Sea-monsters do devoure. Of Libyan Wolves grave Cato feasts the wombes, Whose death, of worth the world defrauded leaves; Thus some that did deserve Mausolean tombes, Have not a title grav'd upon their graves. And yet may CÃ¦sar who procur'd their death, By brave men slaine be buried with his race; All civill warre quite banish'd with his breath, Let him now dead, and us alive have peace. âWe should desist our thoughts on things to set, âWhich may harme some, and can give help to none, âLearne to forget that which we cannot get, âAnd let our cares be gone of all things gone. âThose who would strive all crosses to o're-come, âTo present times must still conforme their course, âAnd making way for that which is to come, âNot medle with things past, but by discourse. âLet none seek that which doth no good when found; Since CÃ¦sar now is dead, how ever dead; Let all our griefe go with him to the ground, For, sorrow best becomes a lightlesse shade; It were the best, that joyn'd in mutuall love, We physicke for this wounded State prepare: âNeglecting those who from the world remove. âAll men on earth for earthly things must care. Cho. O how those great men friendship can pretend, By soothing others thus with painted windes; And seeme to trust, where treason they attend, Whilst love their mouth, and malice fills their mindes; Those but to them poore simple soules appeare, Whose count'nance doth discover what they thinke, Who make their words, as is their meaning, cleare, And from themselves can never seeme to shrinke. Loe, how Antonius faines to quench all jarres, And whom he hates with kindenesse doth embrace, But as he further'd first the former warres, Some feare he still will prove a foe to peace. Now where Calphurnia stayes our steppes addresse, Since by this sudden chance her losse was chiefe. âAll visite should their neighbours in distresse, âTo give some comfort, or to share in griefe. Scene 2. Calphurnia, Nuntius. Chorus. When darkenesse last imprisoned had myne eyes, Such monstrous visions did my heart affright, That (quite dejected) it as stupid dies Through terrours then contracted in the night; A melancholy cloud so dimmes my brest, That it my mind fit for misfortune makes, A lodging well dispos'd for such a Guest, Where nought of sorrow but th'impression lackes; And I imagine every man I see (My senses so corrupted are by feares) A Herauld to denounce mishaps to me, Who should infuse confusion in my eares. O! there he comes to violate my peace, In whom the object of my thoughts I see; Thy message is charactred in thy face, And by thy lookes directed is to me: Thy troubled eyes rest rowling for reliefe, As lately frighted by some uglie sight; Thy breath doth pant as if growne big with griefe, And straight to bring some monstrous birth to light. Nun. The man of whom the world in doubt remain'd, If that his minde or fortune was more great, Whose valour conquer'd, clemencie retain'd All Nations Subject to the Romane State; Fraud harm'd him more then force, friends more then foes; Ah! must this sad discourse by me be made? Cal. Stay, ere thou further goe defray my woes, How doth my love? where is my life? Nun. dead. Cal. dead? Cho. Though apprehending horrours in her minde, Now since she hath a certaintie receiv'd, She by experience greater griefe doth finde: âTill borne, the passions cannot be conceav'd. When as a high disaster force affords, O how that Tyrant whom affliction bears, Barres th'eares from comfort, and the mouth from words, And when obdur'd scornes to dissolve in teares! Cal. Ah! since the lights of that great light are set, Why doth not darknesse spread it selfe o're all? At least what further comfort can I get, Whose pleasures had no period but his fall? O would the Gods I always might confine Flames in my brest, and floods within my eyes To entertaine so great a griefe as mine, That thence there might fit furniture arise; Yet I disdaine (though by distresse o'rethwrone) By such externall meanes to seeke reliefe: âThe greatest sorrowes are by silence showne, âWhilst all the Senses are shut up with griefe: But miserie doth so tyrannick grow That it of sighes and teares a tribute claimes; âAh! when the cup is full, it must o'reflow, âAnd fires which burne must offer up some flames; Yet though what thou hast sayd my death shall be, (Since sunke so deeply in a melted heart) Of my lives death report each point to mee, For every circumstance that I may smart. Nun. What fatall warnings did foregoe his end, Which by his stay to frustrate some did try? But he who scorn'd excuses to pretend, Was by the destinies drawne forth to die. Whilst by the way he chanc'd to meet with one, Who had his deaths-day nam'd, he to him said: The Ides of March be come; but yet not gone The other answer'd, and still constant stayd: Another brought a letter with great speed, Which the conspiracie at length did touch, And gave it CÃ¦sar in his hand to reade, Protesting that it did import him much. Yet did he lay it up where still it rests, As doe the great whom blest the world reputes, Who (griev'd to be importun'd by requests) Of simple supplicants neglect the suites: Or he of it the reading did deferre, Still troubled by attendants at the gate, Whilst some to show their credit would conferre, To flatter some, some something to entreate. Not onely did the Gods by divers signes Give CÃ¦sar warning of his threatned harmes; But did of foes disturbe the rash designes, And to their troubled thoughts gave strange alarmes; A Senator who by some words we find, To the conspirators (though none of theirs) Had showne himselfe familiar with their minde, Then chanc'd to deale with CÃ¦sar in affaires. That sight their soules did with confusion fill, For, thinking that he told their purpos'd deeds, They straight themselves, or CÃ¦sar thought to kill: âA guiltie conscience no accuser needs; But marking that he us'd (when taking leave) A suters gesture when affording thankes, They of their course did greater hopes conceave, And rang'd them seven according to their rankes. Then CÃ¦sar march'd forth to the fatall place; Neere Pompeys Theater where the Senate was, Where (when he had remain'd a litle space) All the confederats flock'd about. Calph. Alas. Nun. First for the forme, Metellus Cimber crav'd To have his Brother from exile restor'd, Yet with the rest a rude repulse receiv'd, Whilst it they all too earnestly implor'd: Bold Cimber who in strife with him did stand, Did strive to cover with his Gowne his head: Then was the first blow given by Casca's hand, Which on his necke a litle wound but made. And CÃ¦sar (starting whilst the stroke he spi'd) By strength from further striking Casca stai'd, Whilst both the two burst out at once, and cry'd: He Traitour Casca, and he, Brother aide; Then all the rest against him did arise Like desp'rat men, whose furie force affords, That CÃ¦sar on no side could set his eyes, But every looke encountred with some Swords; Yet, as a lyon (when by nets surpriz'd) Stands strugling still so long as he hath strength, So CÃ¦sar (as he had their pow'r despis'd) Did with great rage resist, till at the length He thus cri'd out (when spying Brutus come) And thou my Sonne! then griefe did back rebound: âNought but unkindnesse CÃ¦sar could o'recome, âThat, of all things, doth give the deepest wound. Cho. âAh! when unkindnesse is, where love was thought, âA tender passion breakes the strongest heart: âFor, of all those who give offence in ought, âMen, others hate, but for unkinde men, smart. Nun. Ah! taking then no more delight in light, As who disdainfullie the world disclaim'd, Or if from Brutus blow to hold his sight, As of so great ingratitude asham'd, He with his Gowne when cover'd first o're all, As one who neither sought, nor wish'd reliefe, Not wronging majestie, in state did fall, No sigh consenting to betray his griefe. Yet (if by chance or force I cannot tell) Even at the place, where Pompey's statue stood, (As if to crave him pardon,) CÃ¦sar fell, That in revenge it might exhaust his blood; But when his corpes abandon'd quite by breath, Did fortunes frailties monument remaine, That all might have like int'rest in his death, And by the same, looke for like praise or paine: Then Cassius, Brutus, and the rest began With that great Emperours blood to die their hands; âWhat beast in th'earth more cruell is then man, âWhen o're his reason passion once commands? Cal. Whilst brutish Brutus, and proud Cassius thus Romes greatest Captaine under trust deceiv'd, Where was Antonius (since a friend to us) That he not lost himselfe, or CÃ¦sar sav'd? Nun. The whole conspiratours remain'd in doubt, Had he and CÃ¦sar joyn'd, to be undone, And so caus'd one to talke with him without, Who fain'd a conference till the fact was done. Then knowing well in such tumultuous broiles, That the first danger alwayes is the worst, He fled in hast, disguis'd with borrow'd spoiles, For rage and for disdaine even like to burst. Cal. The Senatours which were assembled there, When they beheld that great man brought to end, What was their part? to what inclin'd their care? I fear affliction could not finde a friend. Nun. Of those who in the Senate-house did sit (So sad an object sorrie to behold, Or fearing what bould hands might more commit) Each to his house a severall way did hold; This act with horrour did confound their sight, And unawares their judgement did surprise: âWhen any hastie harmes un-lookt-for light, âThe resolution hath not time to rise: That man on whom the world did once rely, By all long reverenc'd, and ador'd by some, None to attend him had but two and I. Cho. âTo what an ebbe may fortunes flowing come? Why should men following on the smoake of pride, Leave certaine ease to seeke a dream'd delight, Which when they have by many dangers tri'd, They neither can with safety keepe nor quite? âThe people who by force subdu'd remaine, âMay pitty those by whom opprest they rest; âThey but one Tyrant have, whereas there raigne A Thousand Tyrants in one Tyrants brest; VVhat though great CÃ¦sar once commanded Kings, VVhose onely name whole Nations did appall? Yet now (let no man trust in worldly things) A little earth holds him who held it all. Cal. Ah! had he but beleev'd my faithfull cares, His State to stablish who have alwayes striv'd, Then (scaping this conspiracie of theirs) He, honour'd still, and I had happy liv'd. Did I not spend of supplications store, That he within his house, this day would waste. As I by dreames advertis'd was before, VVhich shew'd what was to come, and now is past; VVhil'st the Sooth-sayers sacrific'd did finde A beast without a heart, their Altars staine, By that presage my soule might have divin'd, That I without my heart would soone remaines; But all those terrours could no terrour give To that great minde, whose thoughts too high still aym'd; He by his fortune confident did live, As, if the heavens, for him had all things fram'd; Yet though he ended have his fatall race, To bragge for this, let not his Murtherers strive: For, O! I hope to see within short space, Him dead ador'd, and them abhorr'd alive. Though now his name the multitude respects, Since murdering one who him had held so deare, VVhil'st inward thoughts each outward thing reflects, Some monstrous shape to Brutus must appeare. Iust Nemesis must plague proud Cassius soone, And make him kill himselfe, from hopes estrang'd; Once all the wrongs by foes to CÃ¦sar done, May by themselves be on themselves reveng'd. Cho. âSome, Soveraigne of the earth, would fortune prove; âAs if, confus'dly, Gods did men advance; âNought comes to men below, but from above, âBy providence, not by a staggering chance: âThough to the cause that last forgoes the end, âSome attribute the course of every thing, âThat cause, on other causes doth depend, âWhich chain'd 'twixt heaven and earth due ends forth bring; âOf those decrees the heavens for us appoint, â(Who ever them approves, or doth disprove) âNo mortall man can disappoint a point, âBut as they please here moves, or doth remove; âWe, when once come the worlds vaine pompe to try, â(Led by the fates) to end our journey haste: âFor, when first borne, we straight begin to dye, âLifes first day is a step unto the last. âAnd is there ought more swift then dayes, and yeares, âWhich weare away this breath of ours so soone, âWhil'st Lachesis to no request gives eares, âBut spinnes the threeds of life till they be done? âYet foolish worldlings following that which flies, âAs if they had assurance of their breath, âTo fraile preferrement fondly strive to rise, âWhich (but a burden) weighs them downe to death. Nun. There's none of us but must remember still, How that the Gods by many a wondrous signe, Did shew (it seem'd) how that against their will, The destinies would CÃ¦sars dayes confine. A monstrous starre amidst the heaven hath beene, Still since they first against him did conspire; The solitary birds at noone were seene, And men to walke environ'd all with fire: What wonder though the heavens at such a time, Do brave the earth with apparitions strange, Then whil'st intending such a monstrous crime, âUnnaturall men make Natures course to change? Cho. Though all such things seeme wonderfull to some, They may by Reason comprehended be, For, what, beyond what usuall is, doth come, The Ignorant with wondring eyes do see. Those bastard Starres, not heritours of th'ayre, Are first conceiv'd below, then borne above, And when fore-knowing things, sprits take most care, And by illusion, superstition move. Yet this, no doubt, a great regard should breed, When Nature hath brought forth a monstrous birth, In secret Characters where men may reade The wrath of heaven, and wickednesse of th'earth. The Naturallists, and th'Astrologians skill May oft, encountring, manifest like care: Since th'one looks back, the other forward still, One may tell what, the other why things are. Nun. Shall sorrow through the waves of woes to saile, Have still your teares for Seas, your sighs for winds; To miserie what do base plaints availe? A course more high becomes heroicke mindes. âNone are o're-come, save onely those who yeeld, From froward Fortune though some blows be borne, Let Vertue serve Adversity for shield: âNo greater griefe to griefe then th'enemies scorne; This makes your foes but laugh to see you weep, At least these teares but for your selfe bestow, And not for that great sprit, whose spoyls heavens keep; For, he no doubt, rests deified ere now. Cal. I onely waile my life, and not his death; Who now amongst th'immortals doth repose, And shall so long as I have bloud or breath, To furnish forth the elements of woes. I care not who rejoyce, so I lament, Who do to darknesse dedicate my dayes, And since the light of my delight is spent, Shall have in horrour all Apollo's rayes. (I will retyre my selfe to waile alone, As trustie Turtles mourning for their Mates) And (my misfortune alwayes bent to mone) Will spurne at pleasures as empoyson'd baits; No second guest shall presse great CÃ¦sars bed, Warm'd by the flames to which he first gave life; I thinke there may be greater honour had, When CÃ¦sars widow, then anothers wife. This had afforded comfort for my harmes, If I (ere chanc'd abandon'd thus to be) Had had a little CÃ¦sar in mine armes, The living picture of his Syre to me. Yet doth that Idoll which my thoughts adore, With me of late most strictly match'd remaine, For, where my armes him sometimes held before, Now in my heart I shall him still remine. That (though I may no pretious things impart) Thy deitie may by me be honour'd oft, Still offring up my thoughts upon my heart, My sacred flame shall alwayes mount aloft. Exeunt. Chorus. What fools are those who do repose their trust On what this masse of misery affords? And (bragging but of th'excrements of dust) Of life-lesse Treasures labour to be Lords: Which like the Sirens songs, or Circes charmes, With shadows of delight hide certaine harmes. Ah! whil'st they sport on pleasures ydle grounds, Oft poyson'd by Prosperitie with Pride, A sudden storme their floting joyes confounds, Whose course is ordred by the eye-lesse guide, Who so inconstantly her selfe doth beare Th'unhappie men may hope, the happy feare. The fortunate who bathe in flouds of joyes, To perish oft amidst their pleasures chance, And mirthlesse wretches wallowing in annoyes, Oft by adversitie themselves advance; Whil'st Fortune bent to mock vaine worldlings cares, Doth change despaires in hopes, hopes in despaires. That gallant Grecian whose great wit so soone, Whom others could not number, did o're-come, Had he not beene undone, had beene undone, And if not banish'd, had not had a home; To him feare courage gave (what wondrous change!) And many doubts are solution strange. He who told one who then was Fortunes childe, As if with horrour to congeale his bloud: That Caius Marius farre from Rome exil'd, Wretch'd on the ruines of great Carthage stood; Though long both plagu'd by griefe, and by disgrace, The Consul-ship regain'd, and dy'd in peace. And that great Pompey (all the worlds delight) Whom of his Theater then th'applauses pleas'd, Whil'st praise-transported eyes endeer'd his sight, Who by youths toyles should have his age then eas'd, He by one blow of Fortune lost farre more Then many battels gayned had before. Such sudden changes so disturbe the soule, That still the judgement ballanc'd is by doubt; But, on a Round, what wonder though things roule? And since within a Circle, turne about? Whil'st heaven on earth strange alterations brings, To scorne our confidence in worldly things. And chanc'd there ever accidents more strange, Then in these stormy bounds where we remaine? One did a sheep-hooke to a Scepter change, The nurceling of a Wolfe o're men did raigne; A little Village grew a mighty Towne, Which whil'st it had no King, held many a Crowne. Then by how many sundry sorts of men, Hath this great State beene rul'd? though now by none, Which first obey'd but one, then two, then ten, Then by degrees return'd to two, and one; Of which three States, their ruine did abide, Two by Two's lusts, and one by Two mens pride. What revolutions huge have hapned thus, By secret fates all violently led, Though seeming but by accident to us, Yet in the depths of heavenly breasts first bred, As arguments demonstrative to prove That weaknesse dwels below, and pow'r above. Loe, prosprous CÃ¦sar charged for a space, Both with strange Nations, and his Countreys spoyls, Even when he seem'd by warre to purchase peace, And roses of sweet rest, from thornes of toils; Then whil'st his minde and fortune swell'd most high, Hath beene constrain'd the last distresse to trie. What warnings large were in a time so short, Of that darke course which by his death now shines? It, speechlesse wonders plainly did report, It, men reveal'd by words, and gods by signes, Yet by the chaynes of destinies whil'st bound, He saw the sword, but could not scape the wound. What curtaine o're our knowledge errour brings, Now drawn, now open'd, by the heavenly host, Which makes us sometime sharpe to see small things, And yet quite blinde when as we should see most, That curious braines may rest amaz'd at it, Whose ignorance makes them presume of wit; Then let us live, since all things change below, When rais'd most high, us those who once may fall, And hold when by disasters brought more low, The minde still free, what ever else be thrall: âThose (Lords of Fortune) sweeten every State, âWho can command themselves, though not their fate.
