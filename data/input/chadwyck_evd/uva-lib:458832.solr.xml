      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honorable Thomas Wriathesley, Earle of Southampton, Lord Wriathsley, of Tichfield, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Sun's Darling. Is he then found? Phœbus make holliday; Tye up thy Steeds; And let the Cyclops Play; Mulceber leave thy Anvile, and be trim; Combe thy black Muzle, be no longer Grim; Mercury be quick, with mirth furnish the heavens, Jove, this day let all run at six and seavens; And Ganimede be nimble, to the Brim Fill Boules of Nectar, that the Gods may swim, To solemnize their healths that did discover The oscure being of the Suns fon'd lover. That from the Example of their liberall mirth We may enjoy like freedome on Earth. John Tatham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">READER. It is not here intended to present thee with the perfect Analogy betwixt the World and man, which was made for Man; Nor their Co-existence, the World determining with Man: this J presume hath bin by others Treated on, But drawing the Curtain of this Morall, you shall finde him in his progression as followeth. The first Season. Presents him in the Twy-light of his age Not Pot-gun-proofe, and, yet hee'l have his page: This smale Knight-Errant will encounter things Above his pearch and like the partridge Springs. The second Season. Folly, his Squire, the Lady Humor brings. Who in his eare farr sweeter Novells sings. He follows them; forsakes the Aprill Queene, And now the Noone-tide of his age is seene. The third Season. As soone as Nerv'd with strength, he becoms Weake, Folly and Humor, doth his reason breake; Hurries him from his Noone-tide to his even; From Summer to his Autumne he is driven. The fourth Season. And now the Winter, or his nonage takes him: The sad remembrance of his errours wakes him; Folly and Humour, Faine hee'd cast away, But they will never leave him, till hee's Clay. Thus Man as Clay Descends, Ascends in spirit; Dust, goes to dust, The soule unto It's Merit.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. An Altar. Enter the Priest of the Sun. Raybright discovered sleeping. Pr. Let your tunes, you sweet-voic'd spears, overtake him: Charm his fancies, ope his ears, now awake him. begin. SONG. Fancies are but streams of vain pleasure: They who by their dreams true ioies measure; Feasting, starve; laughing, weep; playing smart, whilst in sleep fools with shadows smiling, wake and and finde hopes like winde, Idle hopes beguiling. Thoughts flie away, Time hath past'em Wake now, awake, see and taste 'em. Ray. That I might ever slumber, and enjoy Contents as happie as the soul's best wishes Can fancie or imagine, 'tis a crueltie Beyond example, to usurp the peace I sate inthron'd in, who was't pluck'd mee from it. Pr. Young man look hither. Ray. Good; I envie not The pomp of your high office; all preferment Of earthly glories are to me diseases, Infecting those sound parts which should preserve The flattering retribution to my thankfulness; The times are better to me; there's no taste Left on the pallate of my discontent To catch at emptie hopes, whose onely blessedness Depends on beeing miserable. Pr. Raybright. Thou drawst thy great descent from my grand patron the Sun; whose priest I am. Ray. For small advantage; Hee who is high-born never mounts yon battlemen Of sparkling stars, unless I bee in spirit As humble as the childe of one that sweats To eat the dear-earn'd bread of honest thrift. Pr. Hast thou not flow'd in honors? Ray. Honors, I'de not bee baited with my fears Of loosing em, to bee their monitrous creature An age together, 'tis beside as comfortable To die upon the embrodrie of the grass, Unwinded, as to set a world at gaze, Whilst from a pinacle I tumble down And break my neck, to bee talk'd of, and wonder'd at. Pr. You have worn rich habits. Fine Ass-trappings. A Pedler's heir turn'd gallant, follows fashion. Can by a cross-legg'd Tailor bee transform'd Into a Jack a napes of passing bravery: 'Tis a stout hapiness to wear good clothes, Yet live and die a fool—mew. Pr. You have had choice Of beauties to enrich your marriage-bed. Ray. Monkyes and Parakeetoes are as prettie To play withall, tho not indeed so gentle. Honestie's indeed a fine jewel, but the Indies Where it grows is hard to bee discovered, troath sir I care for no long travels with lost labor. Pr. Pleasures of every sence have been your servants, When as y'ave commanded them. Ray. To threaten ruine, Corrupt the puritie of knowledg, wrest Desires of better life, to those of these This scurvie one, this life scarce worth the keeping. Pr. 'Tis melancholy, and too fond indulgence To your own dull'd affections: sway your judgment, You could not else bee thus lost, or suspect The care your ancestor the Sun takes of yee. Ray. The care, the scorn hee throws on mee. Pr. Fie, fie; Have you been sent out into strange lands, Seen Courts of forreign Kings, by them been grac'd, To bring home such neglect. Ray. I have reason for't. Pr. Pray shew it. Ray. Since my coming home I have found More sweets in one unprofitable dream, Then in my lives whole pilgrimage. Pr. Your fantasie Misleads your judgment vainly, sir in brief I am to tell you, how I have receiv'd From your Progenitor, my Lord, the Sun, A token, that he visibly will descend From the celestial orbe to gratifie all your wilde longings. Ray. Very likely, when pray: The world the whiles shall be beholding to him For a long night, new married men will curse, Tho their brides tickle for't, oh! candle and lanthorn Will grow to an excessive rate i'th Citie. Pr. These are but flashes of a brain disordered. Contein your float of spleen in seemly bounds, Your eies shall bee your witness. Ray. Hee may come. Enter Time with a whip, whipping Follie before him. Tim. Hence, hence, thou shame of nature, mankindes foil: Time whipps thee from the world, kicks thee, and scorns thee. Fol. Whip me from the world, why whip? am I a dog, a cur, a mungrel; baw waw. Do thy worst, I defie thee. Sings. I will rore and squander, Cozen, and bee drunk too; I will maintein my Pander, Keep my Hors, and Punck too; brawl and scuffle, shift and shuffle, Swagger in my Potmeals: Dammes rank with, do mudpranck with Roaring boies and oatmeals, Pox a time, I care not, being past 'tis nothing: I'le be free and spare not, sorrows are lives loathing, melancholy is but folly, Mirth and youth are plotters. Time go hang thee, I will hang thee, Though I die in cutters. And what think you of this, you old doting moth-eaten bearded rascal; as I am Follie by them others side, and a true-bred Gentleman, I will sing thee to death, if thou vex mee: Cannot a man of fashion, for his pleasure, put on now and then his working-day robes of humility, but he must presently be subiect to a Beadles rod of Correction; goe mend thy selfe Caniball, 'tis not without need, I am sure the Times were never more beggerly and proud, waiting-women flant it in Cast-suits, and their Ladies fall for em; knaves over-brave wise men, while wise men stand with cap and knee to fooles: Pitifull Time! pitifull Time! Ty. Out foul, prodigious, and a bortive birth; Behold the sand glasse of thy dayes is broke Fol. Bring me another, I'le shatter that too. Ty. No; th'aft mispent thy hours, lavish fool, like The circuit of thy life, in ceaselesse riots It is not therefore fit that thou shouldst live In such a Court as the Sunnes Majesty Vouchsafes to illuminate with his bright beames. Fol. In any Court, father bald-pate, where my granam the Moon shews her hornes, except the Confistory Court, and there she need not appeare; Cuckolds Carry such sharp Stelettoes in their fore-heads, I'le live here and laugh at the bravery of ignorance, mauger thy scurvie and abhominable beard. Ty. Priest of the Sunne 'tis neere about the minute, thy Patron will descend, scourge hence this trifle; Time is ne're lost, till in the common Schools Of impudence, time meets with wilfull fooles. Exit. Fol. Farewell 1538, I might have said five thousand, but the others long enough a Concience to be honest Condition'd, pox on him; it's anotable railing whipper, of a plain Time whipper. Pre. You heard the charge he left. Fol. I, I, a may give a charge, a has been a petty Court-holder ever since he was a minute old, he tooke you for a fore-man of a Jurie. Ray. Pray sir, what are you? Fol. Noe matter what, what are you? Ray. Not as you are, I thank my better fates, I am grand child to the Sun. Fol. And I am Cosen german, some two or three hundred removes off, to the Moon, and my name is Folly. Ray. Folly, sir of what quality? Fol. Quality; any quality in fashion: Drinkeing, Whoring, Singing, Dancing, Dicing, Swearing, Roring, Foisting, Lying, Cogging, Canting, &amp; cetero, will you have any more. Ray. you have a merry heart, if you can guid it. Fol. Yes faith; so, so, I laugh not at those whome I feare, fear not those whom I love, and I love not any whom I laugh not at, pretty strange humor, is't not? Ray. To any one that knowes you not, it is. Pre. You must a void. Enter Recorders. Fol. Away away, I have no such meaning indeed-la. Pre. Hark the faire hour is com, draw to the Alter, And with a mazement, reverence, and comfort Behold the broad ey'd lamp of heaven descending,—Stand— The Sunne above. Fol. Oh brave! Pre. Stand. SONG. Glorious and bright, loe here we bend Before thy throne, trembling, attend Thy sacred pleasures, be pleased then To shower thy comforts downe, that men May freely taste in lifes extreams The influence of thy powerfull dreams. Roy. Let not my fate too swiftly runne, Till thou acknowledge me thy sunne. Oh theres no joy even from the wombe, Of frailty: till we be called home. Fol. Now am I an arant rascall, and cannot speak one word for my selfe, if I were hang'd. Sun. Ray-bright. Pre. It calles yee, answer. Ray. Lord and Father. Sun. We know thy cares, appear to give release, Boldly make thy demands, for we wil please To grant what ere thou saist for. Ray. Fair beam'd sir; I dare not greedily prefer Eternitie of earths delights, Before that dutie which invites My filial pietie, in this Your love shall perfect my hearts bliss; If I, but for one onely year, Enjoy the several pleasures here, With every season in his kinde, Can bless a mortal with. Sun. I finde Thy reason breeds thy appetite, and grant it Thou master'st thy desire, and shall not want it; To the spring garden let him bee convey'd, And entertain'd there by that lovely maid: All the varieties the Spring can shew, Be subject to his will. Pre. Lights Lord, wee go. Fol. And I will follow, that am not in love with such fopperies. Exit. Sun. We must descend, and leav a while our sphere To greet the world—ha, there does now appear A circle in this round, of beams that shine, As if their friendly lights would darken mine: No let em shine out still, for these are they, By whose sweet favors, when our warmths decay, Even in the storms of winter, daily nourish Our active motions, which in Summer flourish By their fair quickning dews of noble loves: Oh may you all like stars, whilst swift time moves, Stand fixt in firmaments of blest contents: Mean while recreations wee present, Shall strive to please; I have the foremost tract; Each season else begins and ends an Act. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Spring, Raybright, Youth, Health and Delight. Spr. Welcom the mother of the year, the Spring; That mother on whose back age ne're can sit. For age still waits upon her that Spring the Nurse; Whose milk the Summer sucks, and is made wanton. Physitian to the sick, strength to the sound; By whom all things above, and under-round Are quickned with new heat, fresh blood, brave vigor, That Spring on thy fair cheeks, in kisses laies Ten thousand welcoms, free as are those raies From vvhich thy name thou borrowest: glorious name! Raybright, as bright in person as in fame. Ray. Your eies amaz'd mee first, but now mine ears Feel your tougues charms, in you move all the sphears. Oh Ladie! would the Sun, which gave mee life, Had never sent me to you. Spr. Why! all my veins Shrink up, as if cold Winter were com back, And with his frozen beard have mumm'd my lips To hear that sigh fly from you. Ray.

A green sickness thing, I came by the way of a hobby-horse letter of Attorney, sent by my Ladie as a spie to you: Spring a hot Ladie, a few fields and gardens lass, can you feed upon sallets and tanzies, eat like an Asse upon grasse every day at my Ladies, coms to you now a Goose, now a Woodcock, nothing but fowl; fowl pies, platters all cover'd with foul, and is not fowl yery good fare?

The self same Bay tree into which was turnd: Peneian Daphne, I have still kept green; That tree shall now be thine, about it sit: All the old poets with fresh Lawrel Crownd, Singing in verse the praise of chastity; Hither when thou shalt come, they all shall rise, Sweet Cantoes of thy love, and mine to sing: And invoke none but thee as Delian King. Ray. Live by singing ballets? Fol. Oh! base, turn poet, I would not be one my self. Hu.

Ray. Rare! Hu. At one end of this pallace shall be heard That Musique which gives motion to the Heaven; And in the midle Orpheus shall sit and weep, For sorrow that his Lute had not the charmes To bring his faire Euredice from hell; Then at an other end— Ray.

Health, recover her; sirrah Youth, look to her. Hea. That bird that in her nest sleeps out the spring May fly in Summer, but with sickly wing. Exit. Ray. I owe thee for this pill, Doctor. Hu. The Spring will Dye sure. Ray. Let her? Hu. If she does, Folly here is a kind of a foolish poet, And he shall write her Epitaph. Ray. Against the morning See it then writ, and I'le reward thee for it. Fol. It shall not need. Ray. 'Tis like it shall not need, this is your Folly, Hu. He shall be ever yours. Fol. I hope ever to be mine own folly, Hee's one of our fellows. Hu. In triumph now I lead thee; no, be thou Cesar, And lead me. Ray.

How coole wert thou in anger, in thy dyet How temperate, and yet sumptuous; thou wouldst not waste The waight of a sad violet in excesse; yet still thy board had dishes numberlesse. Dumbe beasts even lov'd thee; once a young Lark Sate on thy hand, and gazing on thine eyes Mounted and sung, thinking them moving skies— Enter Follie. Fol. I ha don my Lord: my Muse has pump'd hard for an Epitaph upon the late departed Spring, and here her lines spring up. Ray. Read. Fol. Read; so I will, pleas you to reach mee your high ears. Here lie's the blith Spring, Who first taught birds to sing; Yet in April herself fell a crying: Then May growing hot A sweating sickness shee got, And the first of June lay a dying. Yet no month can say But her merry daughter May Stuck her Coffin with flowers great plenty, The Cuckow sung in verse An Epitaph o're her berse, But assure you the lines were not dainty. Ray. No more are thine, thou Ideot; hast thou none To poison with thy nastie jiggs but mine, My matchless frame of nature, Creations wonder, Out of my sight. Fol.

Hu. Your Spring. Ray. Yes she, even she, onely the Spring: One morning spent with her, was worth ten nights With ten of the prime beauties in the world: She was unhappie never, but in two sons, March a rude roring fool. Fol. And April a whining puppie. Hu. But May was a fine piece. Ray. Mirror of faces. Fol. Indeed May was a sweet creature, and yet a great raiser of May-poles. Hu. When will you sing my praises thus?

Humor Madam, if all are your bastards that are given to humor you, you have a companie of as arrant rascals to your children, as ever went toth' gallows; a Collier being drunk jossell'd a Knight into the kennel, and cry'd 'twas his humor; the Knight broke his coxcomb, and that was his humor.

Fortunes wheel is thine, depose me, I'me thy slave, thy power hath bound me. Cup. Cupids shafts are thine, dispose me, Love loves love, thy graces wound me. Fort., Cup. Live, reign, pitie is fames jewel; We obay, oh! be not cruel. Ray. You ravish me with infinites, and lay A bountie of more sovereigntie and amazement, Then the Atlas of mortalitie can support— Enter Humor and Follie Hu. Whats here. Fol. Nay pray observe. Ray. Be my hearts Empresse, build your kingdom there. Hu. With what an earnestnesse he complies. Fol. Upon my life he means to turn Costermonger, and is projecting how to forestall the market; I shall crie Pippins rarely. Ray. Till now, my longings were ne're satisfied, And the desires my sensuall appetite Were onely fed with barren expectations, To what I now am fill'd with. Fol. Yes we are fill'd and must be emptied, these wind fruits have distended my guts into a Lenten pudding, theres no fat in them, my belly swells, but my sides fall away, a month of such diet would make me a living Anatomie. Po. These are too little, more are due to him, That is the patterne of his fathers glorie; Dwell but amongst us, industrie shall strive, To make another artificiall nature; And change all other seasons into ours. Hu. Shall my heart breake, I can containe no longer. Ray. How fares my lov'd Humor? Hu. A little stirr'd, no matter, i'le be merry; Call for some Musick, do not; i'le be melancholly. Fol. A sullen humor, and common, in a dicer that has lost all his money. Po. Lady! I hope 'tis no neglect of Courtesie In us, that so disturbs you, if it rise From any discontent, reveal the cause, It shall be soone removed. Hu. Oh! my heart, helpe to unlace my gowne. Fol. And unlace your peticoate. Hu. Sawcie, how now! 'tis well you have some sweet heart, some new fresh sweet heart; i'me a goodly foole to be thus plaied on, stall'd, and foyl'd. Po. Why Madam? We can be courteous without staine of honor; 'Tis not the raging of a lustfull blood That we desire to tame with satisfaction: Nor hath his masculine graces in our brest Kindled a wanton fire, our bounty gives him A welcome free, but chaste and honorable. Hu. Nay 'tis all one, I have a tender heart, Come, come, lee's drink. Fol. A humor in fashion with gallants, and brought out of the low Countries. Hu. Fie! there's no musick in thee, let us sing. Fol. Here's humor in the right trim, a few more such toies would make the little world of man runne mad, as the Puritan that sold his conscience for a May pole— Florish: showre. Ray. The meaning of this mirth. Po. My Lord is coming. Ray. Let us attend, to humble our best thanks, For these high favours— Enter Autumne &amp; Baccanalian, Humor &amp; Follie. Pom. My dearest Lord, according to th'injuction Of your command, I have with all observance, Given entertainment to this noble stranger. Au. The Sun-born Raybright, minion of my love, Let us be twins in heart, thy grandsires beames Shine graciously upon our fruits, and vines: I am his vassail-servant, tributarie: And for his sake, the knigdomes I possesse, I will devide with thee, thou shalt command The Lidian Tmolus, and Campanian mounts, To nodd their grape-crownd heads into thy bowles, Expressing their rich juice: a hundred graines Both from the Beltick and Sicilian fields, Shall be Congested for thy sacrifice In Ceres fane, Tiber shall pay thee Apples, And Sicyon Olives, all the Choicest fruits, Thy Fathers heat doth ripen. Ray. Make me but treasurer Of your respected favours, and that honor Shall equall my ambition. Au. My Pomona, Speed to prepare a banquet of novelties; This is a day of rest, and we the whiles, Will sport before our friends, and shorten time With length of wonted revels. Pom. I obey: Will't please you Madam, a retirement From these extreames in men, more tollerable, Will better fit our modesties. Hu. I'le drink, and be a Bacchanalian, no, I will not; Enter, i'le follow; stay, i'le go before. Po. Ee'ne what humor pleaseth. Exit. Florishes Au. Raybright, a health to Phœbus—Drinks. These are the Peans which we sing to him, And ye wear no baies, our cups are onely Crowned with Lyeus blood, to him a health—Drinks. Ray. I must pledge that too. Au. Now one other health To our grand Patron, called, good fellowship; Whose livery, all our people hereabout Are call'd in.— Drinks Ray. I am for that too. Au. 'Tis well, let it go round, and as our custome is Of recreations of this nature, ioyne, Your voices, as you drink, in lively notes; Sing Jos unto Baccus. Fol. Hey hoes, a god of windes, there's at least four and twenty of them imprisoned in my belly; if I sigh not forth some of them, the rest will break out at the back door; and how sweet the Musick of their roring will be, let an Irishman judge. Ray. He is a songster too. Fol. A very foolish one; my Musiques naturall, and came by inheritance, my father was a French Nightingall, and my mother an English wagtaile; I was born a Cuckow in the Spring, and lost my voice in Summer, with laying my egges in a sparrowes nest; but I'le venture for one, fill my dish; every one take his own, and when I hold up my finger, off with it. Au. Begin. Fol. Cast away care, hee that Loves sorrow, Lengthens not a day, nor can buy to morrow: Money is trash, and he that will spend it, let him drink merrily, Fortune will send it. Merrily, Merrily, Merrily, Oh ho. Play it off stiffly, we may not part so: merrily &amp;c. Wine is a Charme, it heates the blood too, Cowards it will arm, if the wine be good too; quickens the wit, and makes the bark able; scornes to submit to the watch or Constable. Merrily, &amp;c. Pots fly about, give us more Liquor; Brothers of a rowt, our braines will flow quicker; emptie the Cask, score up, wee care not, fill all the Pots again, drink on, and spare not, Merrily, &amp;c. Now have I more air then ten Musicians, besides there is a whirlwinde in my brains, I could both caper and turn round. Au. Oh! a Dance by all meanes, Now cease your healths, and in an active motion Bestir yee nimbly, to beguile the hours. Fol. I am for you in that too, 'twill jogge down the lees of these rowses into a freer passage; but take heed of sure footing, 'tis a slippery season; many men fall by rising, and many women are raised by falling— Dance Au. How likes our friend this pastime? Ray. Above utterance, Oh! how have I in ignorance and dullnesse, Run through the progresse of so many minutes; Accusing him, who was my lifes first author, Of slacknesse and neglect, whilst I have dream't The folly of my daies in vaine expence, Of uselesse taste and pleasure; pray my Lord Let one health passe about, whilst I be think me What course I am to take, for being denison In your unlimited courtesies. Au. Devise a round, You have your liberty. Ray. A health to Autumns selfe. And here let time hold still his restlesse glasse, That not another golden sand may fall To measure how it passeth. Au. Continue here with me, and by thy presence Create me favorite to thy faire progenitor; And be mine heire. Ray. I want words to expresse my thankfullnesse. Au. What ere the wanton Spring, When she doth diaper the ground with beauties, Toils for, comes home to Autumne, Summers sweats Fither in pasturing her furlongs, reaping The cropp of bread, ripening the fruits for food. Autumnes garners house them, Autumnes jollities Feeds on-them; I alone in every land Traffique my usefull merchandize, gold and jewells, Lordly possessions, are for my commodities Morgag'd and lost, I sit Cheese moderator Between the cheek-parch'd Summer, and th'extreames Of Winters tedious frost; nay, in my selfe I do containe another teaming Spring: Surety of health, prosperity of life Belongs to Autumne, if thou then canst hope T'inherit immortality in frailty, live here till time be spent, yet be not old. Ray. Under the Sun, you are the yeers great emperor. Au. On now, to new veriety of feasts; Princely contents are fit for princely guests, Exit— Ray. My Lord I'le follow; sure I am not well. Florish. Fol. Surely I am halfe drunk, or monstrously mistaken, you mean to stay here belike. Ray. Whither should I go else? Fol. Nay, if you will kill your selfe in your own defence, I'le not be of your Jurie— Enter Humor. Hu. You have had precious pleasures, choice of drunkennesse; will you be gon? Ray. I feele a warr within me, And every doubt that resolution kills Springs up a greater in the years revolution; There cannot be a season more delicious, When Plenty (Summers daughter) empties daily Her cornucopia, fill'd with choisest viands. Fol. Plenties horne is alwaies full in the City. Ray. When temperate heat offends not with extremes; When day and night have their distinguishment With a more equall measure. Hu. Ha! in contemplation. Fol. Troubling himself with this windy-gutts; this bellyaking Autumne; this Apple John Kent, and warden of Fruiterers hall. Ray. When the bright Sun, with kindly distant beames guilds ripen'd fruit. Hu. And what fine meditation transports you thus, You study some Encomium Upon the beauty of the gardens Queene, You'd make the palenesse to supply the vacancie Of Cinthia's dark defect. Fol. Madam! let but a green sicknesse chamber-maid be throughly steel'd, if she get not a better color in one month, I'le bee forfeited to Autumne for ever, and fruite-eate my flesh into a consumption. Hu. Come Raybright, whatsoer'e suggestions Have won on thy apt weakenesse, leave these empty And hollow sounding pleasures, that include Onely a windy substance of delight, Which every motion alters into ayre: I'le stay no longer here. Ray. I must. Hu. You shall not, These are adulterate mixtures of vain follies; I'le bring thee Into the Court of Winter, there thy food: Shall not be sicklie fruits, but healthfull broathes, Strong meat and dainty. Fol. Porke, Beefe, Mutton, (very sweet Mutton, veale Venson, Capon, fine fat Capon, partridge, Snite, plover, larkes, Teale admirable Teale, my Lord. Hu. Mistery there, like to another nature, Confects the substance of the choisest fruits, In a rich candy, with such imitation Of forme and colour, 'twill deceive the eye: Untill the taste be ravished. Fol. Comfits and Carawaies, Marchpaines and Marmalades Suger-plums and Pippin-pies, ginger bread and Walnuts Hu. Nor is his bounty limited, hee'le not spare T'exhaust the treasure of a thousand Indies. Fol. Two hundred pound suppers, and neither fidlers nor broken glasses reckoned, besides, a hundred pound a throw, ten times together, if you can hold out so long. Ray. You tell mee wonders! Be my conductresse, I'le flie this place in secret; Three quarters of my time is almost spent, The last remains to crown my full content. Now if I fail, let man's experience read me; 'Twas Humor, join'd with Follie, did mislead me. Hu. Leav this naked season, Wherein the very trees shake off their locks, It is so poor and barren. Fol. And when the hair fall's off, I have heard a Poet say, 'tis no good sign of a sound bodie. Ray. Com let's go taste old Winter's fresh delights, And swell with pleasures our big appetites. The Summer, Autumne, and the Spring, As 'twere conjoin'd in one conjugal ring; An embleme of four Provinces we sway, Shall all attend our pastimes night and day; Shall both be subject to our glorious state, While wee enjoy the blessings of our fate: And since wee've notice that som barbarous spirits Mean to oppose our entrance, if by words They'l not desist, wee'l force our way with swords. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Enter three Clowns. 1. Hear you the news neighbor? 2. Yes, to my grief neighbor; they say our Prince Raybright is coming hither, with whole troops and trains of Courtiers; wee'r like to have a fine time on't neighbors. 3. Our Wives and Daughters are, for they are sure to get by the bargain, tho our barn be emptied, they will be sure to bee with barn for't: Oh! these Courtiers, neighbors, are pestilent knaves; but ere I'le suffer it, I'le pluck a Crow with som of em. 1. Faith neighbor let's lay our heads together, and resolve to die like men, rather then live like beasts. 2. I, like horn-beasts, neighbor; they may talk and call us Rebells, but a figg for that, 'tis not a fart matter; let's be true amongst our selvs, and with our swords in hand resist his entrance— Enter Winter. Wint. What such murmurings does your gall bring forth, Will you prov't true, no good coms from the North; Bold sawcie mortals, dare you then aspire With snow and ice to quench the sphere of fire: Are your hearts frozen like your clime, from thence All temperate heat's fled of obedience: How durst you else with force think to withstand Your Princes entrie into this his land; A Prince who is so excellently good, His virtue is his honor, more then blood; In whose clear nature, as two Suns, do rise The attributes of Merciful, and Wise: Whose laws are so impartial, they must Be counted heavenly, cause th'are truly just: Who does with princely moderation give His subjects an example how to live; Teaching their erring natures to direct Their wills, to what it ought most to affect: That as the Sun does unto all dispence Heat, light, nay life from his full influence, Yet you wilde fools, possest with gyant rage, Dare, in your lawlesse furie, think to wage War against heaven, and from his shining throne Pull Jove himself, for you to tread upon; Were your heads circled with his own green Oak, Yet are they subject to his thunder-stroak; And he can sink such wretches as rebell, From heaven's sublime height, into the depth of hell. 1. The divel a can as soon, we fear no colors, let him do his worst; there's many a tall fellow besides us, will die rather then see his living taken from them, nay even eat up; all things are grown so dear, there's no enduring more mouths then our own, neighbor. 2. Thou'rt a wise fellow, neighbor, prate is but prate; they say this Prince too would bring new laws upon us, new rights into the Temples of our gods, and that's abominable, wee'l all bee hang'd first— Wint. A most fair pretence, To found rebellion upon conscience; Dull stubborn fools, whose perverse judgments still Are govern'd by the malice of your will, Not by indifferent reason, which to you Coms, as in droughs the elemental dew Does on the parch'd earth, 'twets, but does not give Moisture enough to make the plants to live: Things void of soul, can you conceive that he, Whose every thought's an act of pietie, Who's all religious, furnish'd with all good That ever was compris'd in flesh and blood, Cannot direct you in the fittest way To serv those powers, to which himself does pay True zealous worship, nay's so near ally'd To them, himself must needs be deified— Enter Follie. Fol. Save you Gentlemen! 'tis very cold, you live in frost, y'ave Winter still about you. 2. What are you sir? Fol. A Courtier sir; but you may guesse, a very foolish one, to leav the bright beams of my Lord, the Prince, to travel hither; I have an Ague on me, do you not see me shake: Well, if our Courtiers, when they com hither, have not warm young wenches, good wines, and fires to heat their bloods, 'twill freez into an Apoplexie; farewell frost, I'le go seek a fire to thaw me, I'me all ice I fear already. Exit. 1. Farewel and be hang'd, ere such as these shall eat what we have sweat for, wee'l spend our bloods; com neighbors, let's go call our company together, and go meet this Prince he talks so of. 3. Som shall have but a sowr welcom of it, if my Crab-tree cudgel hold here. Wint. 'Tis, I see, Not in my power to alter destinie: You'r mad in your rebellious mindes, but hear What I presage, with understanding clear: As your black thoughts are mistie, take from me This as a true and certain augurie, This Prince shall com, and by his glorious side Lawrel-crown'd conquest shall in triumph ride, Arm'd with the justice that attend's his cause, You shall with penitence embrace his laws: Hee to the frozen northern clime shall bring A warmth so temperate, as shall force the Spring Usurp my privilege, and by his Ray Night shall bee chang'd into perpetual day. Plentie and happinesse shall still increase, As dors his light, and Turtle-footed Peace Dance like a Faire through his realms, while all That envie him shall like swift Comets fall, By their own fire consum'd, and glorious he Ruling, as 'twere, the force of destinie, Shall have a long and prosperous reign on earth, Then flie to heaven, and give a new star birth. Florish. Enter Raybright, Humor, Bountie, Winter and Delight. But see, our star appear's, and from his eie Flie thousand beams of sparkling majestie. Bright son of Phebus! welcom, I begin To feel the ice fal from my crifled skin; For at your beams the Waggoner might thow His Chariot, axell'd with Riphean snow; Nay, the slow moving North-star having felt Your temperate heat, his isicles would melt. Ray. What bold rebellious Catives dare disturb The happie progresse of our glorious peace. Contemne the Justice of our equall lawes, Prophane those sacred rights, which still must bee Attendant on monarchall dignitie. I came to frolick with you, and to chear Your drouping soules by vigor of my beams; And have I this strange welcom! reverend Winter! I'me come to be your guest; your bounteous free Condition does assure, I shall have A welcom entertainment. Win. Illustrious sir! I am ignorant How much expression my true zeale will want To entertain you fitlie, yet my love, And hartie dutie, shall be farr above My outward welcome, to that glorious light, Of heaven, the Sunne which chaces hence the night; I am so much a vassaile, that I'le strive, By honoring you, to keep my faith alive To him, brave Prince, tho you, who do'inherit Your fathers cheerefull heat, and quickning spirit; Therefore as I am Winter, worne and spent So farre with age, I am Tymes monument; Antiquities example, in my zeale, I, from my youth, a span of Tyme will steale To open the free treasures of my Court, And swell your soul with my delights and sport. Ray. Never till now Did admiration beget in me truly The rare match'd twins at once, pittie and pleasure; So royall, so aboundant in earth's blessings, Should not partake the comfort of those beames, With which the Sun beyond extent doth cheere The other seasons, yet my pleasures with you, From their false charmes, doth get the start as farr As heaven's great lamp from every minor starr. Boun. Sir! you can speak wel, if your tongue deliver The message of your heart, without some cuning Of restraint, we may hope to enjoy The lasting riches of your presence hence, Without distrust or change Ray. Winters sweet bride, All Conquering Bounty, queen of harts, life's glory, Natures perfection; whom all love, all serve; To whom Fortune, even in extreame's a slave, When I fall from my dutie to thy goodness, Then let me be ranck'd as nothing. Boun. Come you, flatter mee. Ray. I flatter you! Why Madam? you are Bounty; Sole daughter to the royall throne of peace. Hu. He minds not mee now. Ray. Bounties self! For you he is no souldier dares not fight, No Scholar he, that dares not plead your merites, Or study your best Sweetness, should the Sun, Eclips'd for many yeares, forbeare to shine Upon the bosome of our naked pastures, Yet where you are, the glories of your smiles would warm the barren grounds, arm hartless misery, And cherish desolation. Deed I honor you, And as all others ought to do, I serve you. Hu. Are these the rare sights, these the promis'd Complements. Win. Attendance on our revells, let delight Can joyn the day with sable-footed night; Both shall forsake their orbes, and in one sphere Meet in soft mirth, and harmlesse pleasures here; While plump Lyeus shall, with garland crown'd Of triumph-Ivie, in full cups abound Of Cretan wine, and shall dame Ceres call To waite on you, at Winters festivall: While gawdy Summer, Autumne, and the Springe, Shall to my Lord their Choycest viands bring. Wee'l robb the sea, and from the subtill ayre, Fetch her inhabitant, to supply our fare. That were Apicious here, he in one night Should sate with danties his strong appetite. Begin our revells then, and let all pleasure Flow like the Ocean, in a boundlesse measure— Florish. Enter Conceit, and Detraction. Con. Wit and pleasure soft attention, Grace the sports of our invention. De. Conceit peace, for Detraction Hath already drawn a faction, Shall deride thee. Con. Antick leave me; For in laboring to bereave me Of a scholars praise, thy dotage—Shall be hist at. De. Here's a hot age; When such pettie penmen covet Fame by folly, on, I'le prove it Scurvie by thy part, and trie thee By thine owne wit. Con. I defie thee, Here are nobler Judges, wit Cannot suffer where they sit. De. Pri'thee foolish Conceit, leave off thy set-speeches, and come to the conceit if selfe in plain languages; what goodly thing is't, in the name of laughter? Con. Detraction doe thy worste, Conceit appears, In honour of the Sunne, their fellow-friend, Before thy censure; know then that the spheres, Have for a while resigned their orbes, and lend Their seats to the Four Elements, who joyn'd With the Four known Complexions, have atton'd A noble I ague, and severally put-on Materiall bodies; here amongest'em none Observes a difference; Earth and Ayre alike Are sprightly active; Fire and Water seek No glory of preheminence; Phlegm and Blood, Choler and Melancholy, who have stood In contrarieties, now meet for pleasure, To enterain Time in a courtly measure. De. Impossible and inproper; first to personate insensible Creatures, and next to compound quite opposite humors; fie, fie, fie, i'ts abominable. Con. Fond ignorance! how darest thou vainly scan Impossibility; what reignes in man Without disorder; wisely mixt by nature, Maskers. To fashion and preserve so high a creature. De. Sweete sir! when shall our mortall eyes behold this new peece of wonder; We must gaze on the starres for it doubtlesse, Con. See, thus the clouds flie off, and run in chase, The Maskers discover'd. When the Sun's bountie lends peculiar grace. De. Fine ifaith; pretty, and in good earnest but sirrah scholar; will they come down too? Con. Behold em well, the foremost represents Ayr, the most sportive of the Elements, De. A nimble rascall, I warrant him some Aldermans son; wonderous giddy and light-headed; one that blew his patrimony away in feather and Tobacco. Con. The next near him is Fire. Det. A cholerick gentleman, I should know him, a younger brother and a great spender, but seldom or never carries any money about him; he was begot when the sign was in Tauria, for a rores like a Bull, But is indeed a Bell-weather. Con. The third in rank is Water. Det. A phlegmatick cold piece of stuff, his father me thinks should be one of the Dunce-table, and one that never drunk strong beer in's life but at festival times, and then he caught the heart-burning a whole vacation and half a Term after. Con. The fourth is Earth. Det. A shrewd plodding-pated fellow, and a great lover of news; I guesse at the rest, Blood is placed near Air, Choler near Fire, Phlegme and Water are sworn brothers, and so are Earth and Melancholie. Con. Fair nymph of Harmonie, be it thy task To sing them down, and rank them in a mask.— SONG. See the Elements conspire, Nimble Air doe's court the Earth, Water doe's commix with Fire, To give our Princes pleasure birth; Each delight, each joy, each sweet, In one composition meet. All the seasons of the year, Winter doe's invoke the Spring, Summer doe's in pride appear, Autumn forth its fruits doth bring, And with emulation pay Their tribute to this Holy-day; In which the Darling of the Sun is com, To make this place a new Elisium. Dance. Wint. How do these pleasures please? Hu. Pleasures! Boun. Live here, And be my Lord's friend, and thy sports shall vary A thousand waies, invention shall beget Conceits as curious as the thoughts of change Can aim at. Hu. Trifles: progresse o're the year Again my Raybright, therein like the Sun, As he in heaven runs his circular course, So thou on earth run thine, for to be fed With stale delights, breeds dulnesse and contempts Think on the Spring. Ray. She was a lovely Virgin. Wint. My roial Lord! Without offence, be pleas'd but to afford Me give yon my true figure, do not scorn My age, nor think, cause I appear forlorn, I serve for no use, 'tis my sharper breath Doe's purge grosse exhalations from the earth; My frosts and snows do purifie the air From choking foggs, makes the skie clear and fair: And though by nature cold and chill I be, Yet I am warm in bounteous charitie; And can, my Lord, by grave and sage advice, Bring you toth' happie shades of Paradice. Ray. That wonder; Oh! can you bring me thither? Wint. I can direct and point you out a path. Hu. But where's the guide? Quicken thy spirits, Raybright, I'le not leav thee, Wee'l run the self same race again, that happinesse These lazie, sleeping, tedious winters nights Becom not noble action. Ray. To the Spring Recorders. I am resolv'd—Oh! what strange light appears; The Sun is up sure. The Sun above. Sun. Wanton Darling look, and worship with amazement. Oes! gracious Lord. Sun. Thy sands are numbred, and thy glasse of frailtie Here runs out to the last; here in this mirror Let man behold the circuit of his fortunes; The season of the Spring dawns like the Morning. Bedewing Childhood with unrelish'd beauties Of gawdie sights; the Summer, as the Noon, Shines in delight of Youth, and ripens strength To Autumns Manhood, here the Evening grows, And knits up all felicitie in follie; Winter at last draws on the Night of Age; Yet still a humor of som novel fancie Untasted, or untry'd, puts off the minute Of resolution, which should bid farewel To a vain world of wearinesse and sorrows. The powers from whom man do's derive his pedigree Of his creation, with a roial bountie Give him health, youth, delight for free attendants To rectifie his carriage: to be thankful Again to them, Man should casheer his riots, His bosom whorish sweet-heart, idle Humor; His Reasons dangerous seducer, Follie; then shall Like four streight pillars, the four Elements Support the goodly structure of mortalitie; Then shall the four Complexions, like four heads Of a clear river, streaming in his bodie, Nourish and comfort every vein and sinew. No ficknesse of contagion, no grim death Of deprivation of healths real blessings Shall then affright the creature built by heaven, Reserv'd to immortalitie, henceforth In peace go to our Altars, and no more Question the power of supernal greatnesse, But give us leav to govern as wee please Nature, and her dominion, who from us, And from our gracious influence, hath both being And preservation; no replies but reverence. Man hath a double guard, if time can win him; Heavens power above him, his own peace within him. FINIS.</field>
