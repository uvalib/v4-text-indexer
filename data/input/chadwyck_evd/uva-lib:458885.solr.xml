      <field name="fulltext">A Game at ChÃ¦ss as it was Acted nine days to gether at the Globe on the banks side</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Picture plainly explained, after the manner of the Chesse-play. A game at Chesse is here displayde, Betweene the Blacke and White-House made, Wherein Crowne-thirsting Policy, For the Blacke-House (by Falacy) To the White-Knight, checke, often giues, And, to some straites, him thereby driues; The Fat-Blacke-Bishop help's also, With faithlesse heart to giue the blow: Yet (maugre all their craft) at length, The VVhite Knight, with wit-wondrous strength; And circumspectiue Prudency, Giues Check-mate by Discouery To the Blacke-Knight; and so at last The Game (thus) won, the Blacke-House cast Into the Bagge, and therein shut, Finde all their plumes and Cockes-combes cut. Plaine-dealing (thus) by wisedomes guide, Defeates the cheates of Craft and Pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. VVhat of the Game, cald Chesse-play, can be made To make a Stage-Play, shall this day be plaid. First, you shall see the men in order set, States, and their Pawnes, when both the sides are met: The Houses well distinguish't: In the Game Some men entrapt, and taken to their shame, Rewarded by their Play: And in the Close You shall see Checque-Mate giuen to Vertues Foes. But the fair'st Iewell, that our hopes can decke, Is, so to play our Game, t'auoid your Checke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Jnduction. Ignatius Loyola appearing. Error at his feete as asleepe. Ignatius. Ha? where? what Angle of the world is this? That I can neither see the politicke face, Nor with my refined nostrells taste the foot-steps Of any of me Disciples, sonnes and heires As well of my designes, as institutions, I thought they'd spread ouer the World by this time, Couered the earths face, and made darke the land, Like the Egyptian Grasse-hoppers. Here's too much light appeares, shot from the eyes Of Truth and Goodnesse, neuer yet defloured: Sure they were neuer here, then is their Monarchy Vnperfect yet: A iust reward I see For their ingratitude so long to mee, Their father and founder: 'Tis not fiue yeares since I was saluted by 'em, Where slept my honour all the time before? Could they be so forgetfull to cannonize Their prosperous Institutor, when they had saluted. They found no roome in all their Kallender To place my name, that should haue remooued Princes, Puld the most eminent Prelates by the rootes vp, For my deare comming, to make way for me, Lets euerie pettie martire, and Saint Homile, Roch, Main, and Pecronel, itch, and Ague curers, Your Abbesse Alde-gund, and Cuney-gund; The Widdow Marcell, Person Policary, Sislie and Vrslie, all take place of me; And but for the Bissextile, or Leape-yeare; And that's but one in three, I fall by chance, Into the nine and twenteth day of February: There were no roome else for me; see their loue, Their conscience too, trust me a lame Souldier In-to Leape-yeare: My wrath's vp, and me thinkes I could with the first syllable of my name, Blow vp their Colledges: vp Error, awake, Father of Superogation rise: It is Ignatius calles thee, Loyolla. Error. What haue you done? oh I could sleep in ignorance Immortally, the slumber is so pleasing. I saw the brauest setting for a game now, That euer my eie fixt on. Igna. Game: what Game? Error. The noblest Game of all, A Game at Chesse. Betwixt our side, and the white House, the men set In their iust order, ready to goe to it. Igna. Were any of my sonnes plac't for the Game? Error. Yes: and a daughter too, a secular daughter That plaies the Blacke Queenes pawne: he the Blacke Bishops. Igna. If euer power could shew a masterie in thee, Let it appeare in this. Error. 'Tis but a Dreame, A vision you must thinke. Igna. I care not what, So I behold the children of my cunning, And see what ranke they keepe. Error. You haue your wish: Behold there's the full number of the Game, Kings and their Pawnes, Queenes, Bishops, Knights and Dukes. Igna. Dukes they're cald Rookes by some. Error. Corruptiuely: Le roch, the word custodie de La Roch, The keeper of the forts in whom both Kings Repose much confidence, and for their trust sake, Courage and worth do well deserue those titles. Igna. Thy answer's high, see my son and daughter. Er. Those are two pawnes the black Queene, &amp; black Bishops. Igna. Pawnes argue but poore spirits, and light performents: Not worthie of the name of my Disciples: If I had stood so nigh I would haue cut That Bishops throat, but I'd haue had his place; And told the Queene a loue tale in her eare, Would haue made her best pulce daunce, there's elixar Of braine, and spirit amongst em. Error. Why? would you haue em play against themselues? That's quite against the Game (Ignatius.) Igna. Pish, I would rule my selfe, not obserue rule. Err. Why you yould play a game all by your selfe. Igna. I would do any thing to rule alone, Tis rare to haue the word rulde in by one. Err. See'em anon, and view em in their play, Obserue as in a dance they glide away. Igna. Oh with what longing will this brest be tost, Vntill I see this great Game won and lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Prima, ScÅna Prima. Enter from the Blacke-house, the Blacke Queenes Pawne. From the White-house, the White Queenes Pawne. Blacke Queenes pawne. I neuer see that face, but my pitty rises, When I behold so cleare a Maister-peece Of Heauens arte, wrought out of dust and ashes, In that not ours, but the Daughter of Heresie: My soule bleeds at mine eyes. White Q. pawne. Where should truth speake If not in such a sorrow? they're teares plainly: Beshrew me if she weepe not hartity? What is my peace to her to take such paynes in't? If I wander to losse, and with broad eyes Yet misse the path she can runne blind-fold in. (Through often exercise) why should my ouer-sight, Though in the game that ere Christian lost, Rayse the least spring of pitty in her eye, Tis doubtlesse a great charity, and no vertue, Could winne me surer. Blacke Q. P. Blessed things preuaile with't, If euer goodnesse made a gracious promise, It is in yonder looke, what little paines Would build a Fort for vertue to all memory In that sweet creature, were the ground-worke firmer. White Q. P. It has beene all my glory to be firme, In what I haue profest. Blacke Q. P. That is the enemy That steales your strength away, and fights against you, Disarmes your soule, euen in that heate of battle: Your firmnesse that way, makes you more infirme, For the right Christian conflict: there I spied A zealous primitiue sparkle, but now flew, From your deuoted eyes: Able to blow vp all the Heresies That euer sate in Councell with your spirit; Enter the blacke Bishops Pawne. And here comes he whose sanctimonious breath, Can make that sparke a flame: list to him (virgin) At whose first entrance Princes will fall prostrate: Weomen are weaker Vessells. White Q. p. By my pÃ¦nitence A comely presentation, and the habit To admiration reuerend. Blacke Q. p. But the heart, the heart Lady So meeke, that as you see good Charitie pictured still With young ones in her armes, so will hee cherish All his young tractable sweete obedient daughters, E'ene in his armes, in his owne bosome, I am my selfe a secular Iesuitesse, As many Ladies are of worth and greatnesse, A second sort are Iesuits in voto, Giuing their vow into the father generall: That's the Blacke Bishop of our house, whose pawne This Gentleman now stands, now to receiue The Colledge habit at his holy pleasure. White Q. p. But how are these in voto emploied (Lady) Till they receiue the habit. Blacke Q. p. They're not idle, Hee findes 'em all true labourers in the worke Of vniuersall Monarchie, which hee And his Disciples principally aime at. Those are maintayned in many Courts and Pallaces, And are induc'd by noble Personages, Into great Princes seruices, and prooue Some Counsellers of State, some Secretaries: All seruing in notes of intelligence: (As Parish Clerkes,) their mortuary bills, To the father Generall, so are designes Often times preuented, and importinant secrets Of state discouered, yet no author found, But those suspected oft that are most sound: This mistery is too deepe, yet for your entrance, And I offend to set your zeale so backe, Checkt by Obedience, with desire to hasten Your progresse to perfection, I commit you To the great workers hands, to whose graue worth I fit my reuerence, as to you my wishes. Blacke B. p. Dost finde her supple? Blacke Q. p. There's a little passage-made. Blacke B. p. Let me contemplate, With wholy wonder season my accesse; And by degrees approach the Sanctuary Of vnmatcht beauty, set in grace and goodnesse Amongst the daughters of men I haue not found A more Cathalecall aspect, that eye Dos promise single life and meeke Obedience. Vpon those lips the sweete fresh buds of youth, The holy dew of prayer lies like pearle, Dropt from opening eye-lids of the morne, Vppon the bashfull Rose, how beautiously A gentle fast not rigorously imposed, Would looke vpon that cheek, and how delightfull The courteous Physicke of a tender pennance, Whose vtmost cruelty should not exceed The first feare of a bride to beate downe frailty, Would worke to sound health your long festred iudgement, And make your merrit well (through erring ignorance Appeares but spotted righteousnesse to me.) Farre clearer then the innocence of Infants. White Q. p. To the good worke I bowe and will become, Obedience humblest daughter, seythence I finde The assistance of a sacred strength to ayde me: The labour is as easie to serue vertue The right way since, 'tis she I euer serued In my desire, though I transgrest in Iudgement. Black B. p. It's easily absolued amongst the rest, You shall not find the vertue, that you serue now A sharpe and cruell mistresse, her eare's open To all your supplications; you may boldly And safely let in the most secret sinne Into her knowledge, which like vanisht man Neuer returnes into the World agen: Fate lookes not vp more trulier. White Q. p. To the guiltie, That may appeare some benifit. Blacke B. p. VVho so innocent That neuer stands in need on't in some kinde? If euery thought were blabb'd that's so confest, The very ayre we breath would be imblest: Now to the worke indeed, which is to catch Her inclination, that's the speciall vse We make of all our practise in all Kingdomes For my disclosing their most secret frailties, Things which once ours, they must not hide from vs, That's the first Article in the Creede we teach 'em, Finding to what point their blood most enclines, Know best to apt them, then to our designes: Daughter the sooner you disperse your Errors, The sooner you make hast to your discouerie, You must part with'em, to be nice or modest Towards this good action, is to imitate The bashfulnesse of one conceales an vlter, For the vncomly parts that tumor vexes, Till't be past cure. Resolue you thus faire (Ladie) The priuatst thought that runnes to hide it selfe, In the most secret corner of your heart, now Must be of my acquaintance, so familiarlie Neuer she friend of yours might counsell neerer. White Q. p. I stand not much in feare of any account Guilty of that blacke time (most noble holinesse,) I must confesse as in a sacred Temple, Throng'd with an auditorie, some come rather To feede on humane obiect, then to taste Of Angels foode. So in the Congregation of quicke thoughts Which are more infinite, then such assemblies, I cannot for truths safely speake for all: Some haue bin wanderers, some sinful, some sound: But those found euer poore entertainment, They'd incouragement to come againe, The single life which strongly I professe now; Heauen pardon me, I was about to part from. Blacke B. p. Then you haue past through loue? White Q. p. But left no staine In all ray paassge (Sir) no print of wrong; For the most chast maide that may trace my foot-steps. Blacke Bish. p. How came you off so cleare. White Q. p. I was discharged By an inhumane accident, which modesty Forbids me to put any language too. B. B. p. How you forget your selfe? all actions Clad in their proper language, though most sorded My eare is bound by duty to let in, And locke vp euerlastingly: Shall I helpe you? Hee was not found to answere his creation? A vestall Virgine in a slip of prayer, Could not deliuer mans losse modestier: 'Twas the White Bishops pawne. White Q. p. The same (blest Sir.) Blacke B. p. An Heriticke well pickled. White Q. p. By base treachery, And violence prepared by the Competitor: The blacke Knights pawne whom I shall euer hate for't. Blacke B. p. 'Twas of reuenges the vnmanliest way That euer riuall tooke, a villaine That for your sake ile neuer absolue him off. White Q. p. I wish not so heauy. Blacke B. p. Hee must feele it, I neuer yet gaue absolution To any crime of that vnmarring nature: It seemes you refuse him for defect, That other women haue in the ends of marriage: Pardon my boldnesse, if I sift your goodnesse To the last graine. W. Q. p. I reuerence your paines (Sir) And must confesse, custome to enioy What other women challenge and possesse, More ruld me then desire: for my desires Dwell all in Ignorance, and Ile neuer wish To know that fond way, may redeeme them thence. B. B. p. I neuer was so taken, beset dubly Now with her iudgment what a strength it puts forth, I bring worke neerer to you, when you haue seene A maister-peece of man, composed by Heauen For a great Princes fauor, kingdomes loue: So exact Enuy could not finde a place To sticke a blot on person, or on fame: Haue you not found ambition swell your wishes then? And desire stirre your blood. W. Q. p. By vertue neuer: I haue onely in the dignity of the creature, Admired the workes glory. B. B. p. She's impregnable, A second siedge must not fall off so tamely: She's one of those must be informed to know A daughters duty which some take vntaught; Her modesty brings her behind hand much, My old meanes I must flye too, yes 'tis it, Please you pervse this small tract of Obedience, 'Twill helpe you forward well. W. Q. p. (Sir) that is a vertue: I haue euer thought on with especiall reuerence. B. B. p. You will conceiue by that, My power your duty. Enter White Bishops pawne. W. B. p. What makes yond troubler of all Christian water, So neere yond blessed spring? but I know Her goodnesse is the rocke from whence it issues. Vnmoouable as fate, 'twould more afflict me Then all my sufferings for her, which so long As she holds constant to the house she come off, The whitnes of the cause, the side, the quality Are sacrifices to her worth and vertue, And though confined in my religious ioyes, I marry her and possesse her. Ent. the B. Kt. pawne. B. B. p. Behold Lady, The two inhuman enemies, the black Knights pawne, And the white Bishops, the gelder and the gelded. W. Q. p. There's my griefe, my hate. B. Kt. p. What? in the Iesuites fingers? by this hand, Ile giue my part now for a Parrats feather, Shee neuer returnes vertuous, 'tis impossible: Ile vndertake, more wagers will be layd Vpon a Vsurers returne from hell, Then vpon hers from him now: haue I bin guilty Of such base malice, that my very conscience Shakes at the memory of it, and when I looke To gather fruit find nothing but the Sauin tree: Too frequent in Nunnes Orchards, and there planted By all coniecture to destroy fruit rather, I wilbe resolued now most noble Virgine. W. Q. p. Ignoble villaine, dare that vnhallowed tongue Lay hold vpon a sound so gracious, What's noblenesse to thee, or virgine Chastity? They're not of thy acquaintance, talke of violence, That shames creation, deeds would make night blush That's company for thee, hast thou the impudence To court me with the Leprosie vpon thee, Able to infect the walls of a great building. B. B. p. Sonne of offence forbeare, go set your diuell Before your eyes, a pÃ¦nitentiall vesture, Would better become yee, some shirt of haire. B. Kt. p. And you a three pound smocke, steed of an Abbey, An Epicene Cassible, this holy fellow Robs saf'st and close, I feele a sting that's worse too: White pawne, hast so much Charity to accept A reconcilement, make thy owne conditions, For I begin to be extreamely burthned. W. B. p. No truth, no peace, of that blacke house, protest Is to be trusted, but for hope of acquittance, And warned by difference, I may intrap him soonest, I admit conference. B. Kt. p. It is a noblenesse That makes confusion cleaue to all my merrits. B. B. p. That treatise will instruct you fully. B. Kt. So, so, Enter blacke Knight, The businesse of the Vniuersall Monarchy Goes forward well now, the Colledge pot That should be alwayes boyling with the fuell, Of all intelligencers possible, Through the Christian Kingdome is this fellow Our prime incendiary? one of those That promis'd the white Kingdome seauen yeares since To our blacke-house, put a new daughter to him, The great worke-slaues, he minds nor Monarchie Nor Hererazie (diuiner principallities) I brag lesse, But haue done more then all the conclaue on'em Take their assistant fathers in all parts: I, or their father generall in to boote: And what I haue done, I haue done factiously! With pleasant subtilty, and be witching court-ship, Abuse al my beleeuers with delight, They tooke comfort to be cousned by me, Too many a soule I haue let in mortall poyson, Whose cheekes haue crackt with laughter to receiue it, I could so roule my pills in sugred syllables, And strew such kindly mirth o're all my mischiefe, They tooke their baine in way of recreation, As pleasure steales corruption into youth, Hee spies me now, I must vphold his reuerence, Especially in publique (though I know) Pryapus guardian of the cherry Gardens: Bacchus and Venus chit is not more vitious. B. B. p. Blessings accumiliation keep with you (sir.) B. Kt. Honors dissimulation be your due (sir.) W. Q p. How deep in duty in obseruance plunge? His charge must needes be reuerend. B. B. p. I am Confessor To this Black Knight too, you see deuotion's fruitfull, Sh'as many sonnes and daughters. B. K. I do this the more, To maze our aduersaries to behold, The reuerence we giue these great ones, And to beget a sound opinion Of holinesse in them, and zeale in vs; As also to enuite the like obedience In other pupills, by our meeke example: So, is your trifle gone? B. B. p. Trifle call you her, it's a good game (sir) Sure she's the second pawne of the White house, And to the opening of the game I hold her. B. Kt. I you hold well: for that I know your play Of old, if there were more Queenes pawnes you'ld plye The game a great deale harder (now sir we're in priuate) But what for the maine worke, the great existance? The hope Monarchall? B. B. p. It goes on in this. B. Kt. In this? I cannot see't. B. B. p. So you may deny A Dyalls motion, 'cause you cannot see The hand mooue, or a wind that rends the Cedars. B. Kt. Where stops the current of intelligence, Your father generall Bishop of the Blacke-house, Complaines for want of worke. B. B. p. Here's from all parts Sufficient to imploy him, I receiu'd A packet from the assistant fathers lately, Looke you there's Anglica, this Gallica. B. Kt. I marry (sir) there's some quicke-flesh in this. B. B. p. Germanica. B. K. Thinke they'n seald this with butter. B. B. p. Italica this. B. Kt. They put their pens the hebrew way me thinks. B. B. p. Hispanica there. B. Kt. Hispanica, blinde word this, The Iesuite hath writ this with iuice of Leamons sure It must be held close to the fire of Purgatory Ere't can be read. B. B. p. You will not loose your iest (Knight) Though it wound your owne fame. B. Kt. Curanda pecunia. Enter the white Kings pawne. B. B. p. Take heed (Sir) we're intrapt. B. Kt. He's made our owne (man) halfe in voto yours, His heart's in the blacke house, leaue him to me, Most of all friends indeed preciously speciall. W. Kt. p. You see my out-side, but not my heart, Great difference in the colour, there's some intelligence, And as more ripenesse, so your knowledge still Shall prooue the richer, there shall nothing happen (Beleeue't) to extenuate your cause. Or to oppresse her friends, but I will striue To crosse it with my Counsell, purse and power Keep all supplies both in meanes and men, That may rayse against you, we must part, I dare not longer of this theame discussue, The eare of State is quicke and iealious. B. Kt. Excellent estemation, thou art valu'd Aboue the Fleece of gold, that came short home, Poore Iesuit, ridden soule, how art thou foold Out of thy faith, from thy allegance drawne, Which way so ere thou takest, thou'rt the lost Pawne.

      <field name="fulltext">Incipit Secundus. Enter White Queenes Pawne, with a booke in her hand. White Queenes Pawne. And here agen it is the daughters duty To obey her fessors commaund in all things Without exception, or expostulations: Tis the most generall rule that ere I heard of: Yet when I thinke how boundlesse vertue is, Goodnesse and grace lies gently reconciled, And then it appeares well to haue the power Of the dispensor are's vncircumscribde. En. b. B. p. B. B. p. She's hard vpon't, 'twas the most modest key That I could vse to open my intents, What little, or no paines goes to some people: Hah? a seald note, whence this, To the blacke Bishops pawne, these, how to me Strange, who subscribes it? the blacke King what would he. The Letter. Pawne sufficiently holy; but vnmeasurably politicke: Wee had late intelligence from our most industerous seruant, famous in all parts of Europe, (our Knight of the blacke House) that you haue at this instant in chase the white Queenes pawne, and very likely by the carriage of your Game to entrap and take her: These are therefore to require you (by the burning affection I beare to the rape of deuotion) that speedily vpon the surprisall, of her, by all watchfull aduantage you make some attempt vppon the White Queenes person, whose fall or prostitution our lust most violently rages for. Sir after my desire has tooke a Iulep For it's owne inflamation, that yet scorches me, I shall haue cooler time to thinke of yours, She's past the generall rule of the large extent Of our presciption for obedience; And yet with what allacrity of soule, Her eye mooues on the Letter. W. Q. p. Holy Sir, Too long, I haue mist you, oh your absence starues me, Hasten for times redemption (worthy Sir) Lay your commands as thicke and fast vppon me As you can speake em, how I thirst to heare em: Set me to worke vppon this spacious vertue, Which the poore span of life's, to morrow for Boundlesse obedience, the humblest, yet the mightiest of all Duties, well set her downe a vniuersal goodnesse. B. B. p. By holinesse of garment her safe innocence Has frighted the full meaning from it selfe, She's farre off from vnderstanding now The language of my intent, then at first meeting. W. Q. p. For vertues sake, good sir, Commaund me something, Make triall of my duty in some small seruice, And as you finde the faith of my obedience there, Then trust it with a greater. B. B. p. You speake sweetly, I do commaund you first then. W. Q. p. With what ioy, I do prepare my duty. B. B. p. To meete me, And seale a kisse of loue vppon my lips. W. Q. p. Hah. B. B. p. At first disobedient in so little too. How shall I trust you with a greater then, Which was your owne request? W. Q. p. Pray send not backe My Innocence to wound me, be more courteous, I must confesse much like an ignorant plaintiffe Who presuming on the faire path of his meaning Goes rashly on, till on a suddaine brought Into the wildernesse of Law, by words Dropt vnaduisedly, hurts his good cause, And giues the Aduersary aduantage by it, Apply it you can best (sir) if my obedience And your command can find no better way, Fond men command, and wantons best obey. B. B. p. If I can at that distance send you a blessing, Is it not neerer to you in my armes: It flies abroad from these lips dealt in parcells, And I to honour thee aboue all daughters, Invite thee home to the house, where thou mayst surfeit On that, which others miserably pine for: A fauour which the daughters of great Potentates, Would looke of enuies colour but to heare. W. Q. p. Good men may erre sometimes, you're mistaken, Sure if this be vertues path, tis a most strange one, I neuer came this way before. B. B. p. That's your ignorance, And therefore shall that edict still conduct you, That knowes no way but one, nor euer seekes it. Tis strange if vertue should be put to one, If there be twenty wayes to some poore Village. Your feare is wondrous falty, cast it from you, Twill gather else in time a disobedience, Too stubborne for my pardon. W. Q p. Haue I lockt my selfe At vnawares into sinnes seruitude With more desire of goodnesse? is this the tye Of all strickt order, and the holiest Of all societies, the three vowed people For Pouerty, Obedience, Chastity: The last they most forget, when a Virgins raine I see the great worke of Obedience, Is better then halfe finisht. B. B. p. What a stranger, Are you to duty growne, what distance keep you, Must I bid you come forwards to a happines Your selfe should sue for? 'twas neuer so with me, I dare not let this stubbornnesse be knowne, 'Twould bring such fierce hate on you, yet presume not To make that courteous care a preuiledge For wilfull disobedience, it turnes then Into the blacknesse of a curse vppon you, Come, come, be neerer. W. Q p Neerer? B. B. p. Was that in scorne? I would not haue it proued so for the hopes Of the great Monarchy, if it were like it, Let it not dare to flye abroad agen, A stronger I will coape with't. W. Q p. Blesse me, threatnes me, And quite dismayes the good strength that should Helpe me. I neuer was so doubtfull of my safety. B. B. p. 'Twas but my iealousie, forgiue me (sweetnesse) Yours is the house of meeknesse, and no veonome liues Vnder that roofe, be neerer; why so fearefull? Neerer the Altar the more safe and sacred. W. Q. p. But neerer the offerors oft more wicked. B. B. p. A plaine and most insufferable contempt, My glory I haue lost vppon this woman, In freely offering that she should haue kneel'd A yeare in vaine for: my respect is darkned, Giue me my reuerence agen thou hast rob'd me off In thy repulse, thou shalt not carry it hence. W. Q p. (Sir.) B. B. p. Thou'rt too great a winner to depart; And I too deepe a looser to giue way to't. W. Q. p. Oh Heauen! B. B. p. Lay me downe reputation, Before thou sturst thy nice Virginity Is recompence too little for my loue, 'Tis well if I accept of that for both, Thy losse is but thine owne, there's arte to helpe thee, And fooles to passe thee to; in my discouery The whole society suffers, and in that, The hope of absolute Monarchy eclipst, Assurance thou canst make me none for thy secrecy, But by thy honors losse, that act must awe thee. W. Q. p. Oh my distrest condition. B. B. p. Dost weepe? If thou hadst any pitty, this necessity Would wring it from thee, I must else destroy thee: We must not trust the policy of Europe, Vppon a womans tongue. W. Q. p. Then take my life (Sir) And leaue my honor for to guide me to Heauen. B. B. p. Take heed I take not both, which I haue vowed Since, if longer thou resist. W. Q p. Helpe, oh helpe. B. B. p. Art thou so cruell for an honors bable, To vndo a whole fraternity, and disperse The secrets of most nations lock't in vs? W. Q. p. For Heauen and vertues sake. A noyse within. B. B. p. Must force confound noyse? Hah, what's that? silence (if faire worth be in thee.) W. Q. p. Ile venture my escape on all dangers now. B. B. p. Who comes to take me, let me see that pawnes face, Or his proud tympanous Mas-swell with state winde, Which being once prickt in the Convocation house, The corrupt ayre puffes out, and he falls shriueld. W. Q. p. I will discouer the Arch-hypocrite, To all the kinreds of the earth. B. B. p. Confusion in that voyce, Rings the alarum of my vndooing, How, which way scapt she from me? Enter blacke Queenes Pawne. B. Q. p. Are you mad? Can lust infatuate a man so hopefull? No patience in your blood: the dog-starre raines sure, Time, and fire temper would haue wrought her Pliant: I spi'd a Pawne of the white House walke neere vs, And made that noyse of purpose to giue warrant For mine owne turne, which ends in all I worke for. B. B. p. Me thinkes I stand ouer a powder vault, And the match now a kindling: what's to be done? 'Tis his owne case, he will defend you mainly, And hapily here he comes with the black Knight too. Enter Blacke Bishop, and blacke Knight. B. B. Oh you made noble work for the white house, This act will the aduersaries mouth, And blow the Luthrens check, till't cracke agen. B. Kt. This will aduance the great Monarchall businesse In all parts well, and helpe the agents forward, Which I haue leauen yeares laboured to accomplish. On minute sets back by some cod-peece Colledge stil. B. B. p. I dwell not (sir) alone in this default, The blacke house yeelds me partners. B. B. All more cautelous. B. Kt. Qui caute, caste, that's my Motto still, Iue trauailed with that word ouer most Kingdomes, And laine safe with most nations on a leaking bottom I haue beene as often tost on Vennes seas As trymer, and fresher Barkes, when sounder vessels Haue layne at anchor, that is kept the doore. B. B. She has no witnesse then? B. Kt. Grosse wirnesse, when went one of his society? To mischiefe with a witnesse? B. B. I haue don't then, Away vpon the wings of speed, take post horse, Cast thirty leagues of earth behind thee suddenly, Leaue letters ante-dated at our house, Ten dayes at least from this. B. Kt. Bishop I taste thee, Good strong Episcopall counsell, take a bottle on't, Twill serue thee all thy iourney. B. B. p. But good (sir) how, For my getting for the vnspied? B. B. There's Checke agen. B. Q. P. No Ile helpe that. B. Kt. Well sayd my bouncing Iesuitesse, B. Q. p. There lies a secret valt. B. Kt. Away, make hast then. B. B. p. Runne for my Cabinet of intelligences, For feare they search the house, good Bishop burn'em, I cannot stand to picke 'em now. B. B. Begone the dangers all in you. B. Kt. Let me see Queenes pawne, How formerly has packt vp his intelligences, H'as laid them all in truckell beds (me thinkes) And like Court harbingers has writ the names In Chalke vpon their Chambers: Anglica, Oh this is the English house, what newes there trow? Hah by this hand most of these are bawdy epistles, Time they were burnt indeed, whole bundles of'em: Here's from his daughter Blanch &amp; daughter Bridget: From the safe sanctuary in the White-Friers: Those from two tender sisters of compassion, In the bowels of Blomsbury: These three from the Nonnery in Drury lane: A fire, a fire, (go Iesuitesse) a fire: What haue you there? B. B A note (sir) of State policy, And an exceeding safe one. B. Kt. Pray let's see it (Sir) To sell away all the powder in the Kingdome, To preuent blowing vp, that's safe, ile able it: Here's a factious obseruation now, That suits my humor better, he writes here Some wiues in England will commit adultery, And then send to Rome for a Bull for their husbands. B. B. Haue they those shifts? B. K. Oh no familiar breathing Sweeter, here wench take those papers, Scorch em soundly, burne em to French russet, And put em, in agen. B B. Why, what's your mystery? B. K. Oh (sir) 'twill mocke the aduersary strangly, If ere the house be searcht, 'twas done in Vennis Vppon the Iesuiticall expulse there, Where the Inquesitors came all specturald To picke out syllables out of the dung of treason, (As children pick their cherry-stones) yet found none; But what they made themselues with ends of letters. Do as I bid you Pawne. Ent. B. Knights pawne. B. Q. p. Faith not in all, I loue roguria too well to let it fall: How now what newes with you? B. K. p. The sting of conscience Afflicts me so for that inhumane violence, On the White bishops Pawne, it takes away My ioy my rest. B. Q. p. This 'tis to make an Eunuch, You made a sport on't then. B. K. p Cease agreuation, I come to be obsolu'd for't, where is my Confessor, Why do'st thou point to the ground? B. Q. p. 'Cause he went that way: Come, come helpe me in with this Cabinet, Ile tell thee a strange Story. B. K. p. If't be sad tis welcome. B. Q. p. Tis not much troubled with mirth, sir. Ex. Enter Fat bishop, with his Pawne. Fat B. Pawne. B. p. I attend at your holinesse seruice. F. B. For great I grant you, but greatly holy, There the soyld alters fat Cathedrall bodies, Haue very often leane, little soules, Much like the Lady in the Lobstars head, A great deale of shell and garbage of all colours, But for the pure part, that should take wings and mount, That's at last gaspe, as if a man should gape, And from a huge bulke let forth a butter-flye, Like those big-bellied mountaines, which the Poet Deliuers, that are brought to bed with mans flesh, Are my booke Printed pawne, my last invictiues Against the blacke-house? F. B. p. Ready for publication: For I saw perfect bookes this morning (sir) F. B. Fetch me a few, which I will instantly Distribute amongst the White-house. F. B. p. With all speede (sir.) F. B. Tis a most Lordly life to rayle at ease, Set, eate, and drinke vpon the fat of one Kingdome; And rayle vpon an other with the iuce on't: I haue writ this booke out of the strength and marrow Of six and thirty dishes at a meale: But most on't out of cullishe of Cocke sparrowes, Twill sticke and glew the faster to the aduersary, Twill slit the roote of their most Caluish cause, And yet I eate but little Butchers meate In the conception: Of all things I commend the White-house best, For plenty and variety of victualls: When I was one of the blacke-house profest, My flesh sell halfe a Cubit, time to revolt, When my owne ribs reuolted; but to say truth, I haue no preferment yet, that's suteable To the greatnesse of my person and my parts: I grant I liue at ease, for I am made The Maister of the beds, the long acre of beds: But there's no Marie-gold, that shuts and opens, Flower gentles Venus borth, apples of loue, Pluckes, Hyanths, Honie-suckles, Daffa-down-dillies, There was a time I'd much more drab then beds, Now I'ue more beds, then drabs: Yet there's no eminent trader deales in whole-sayle; But she and I haue clap a barging vp, Let in at water-gate, for which I haue rackt My tennants purse-strings, that then'ue twang'd agen: Yonder blacke Knight, the Fistula of Europe, Enter b. B. with b. K. Whose disease once I vndertooke to cure, With a high Holborne halter, when hee last Vouchsaft to peepe into my priuiledged lodgings, He saw good store of plate, and rich hangings: He knew I brought none to the White-house with me, I haue not lost the vse of my profession, Since I turned White-house bishop: En. Pawne with bookes. B. Kt. Looke, more bookes yet? Yonder greasie gormundizing Prelate Does worke our house more mischiefe by his scripts, His fat and fulsome Volumes, Then the whole body of the aduers party. B. B. Oh 'twere a Master-peece of serpent subtilty To fetch him a this side agen. B. Kt. And then damne him Into the bag for euer, or expose him Against the aduerse party, which now he feeds on; And that would double dam him, my reuenge Has prompted me already, ile confound him A both sides for the phisicke he prouided, And the base Chyrurgion he invented for me, Ile tell you what a most vncutholicall ieast He put vpon me once when my paine tortur'd me, He told me he had found a present cure for me, Which I grew proude on, and obseru'd him seriously, What thinke you 'twas, being execution day, He shewd the Hangman to me out at window, The common Hangman. B. B. I'le make him the baloom ball, Of the Churches. And both the sides shall tosse him, he lookes like one, A thing sweld vp with mingled drinke and wine, And will bound well from one side to another. Come, you shall write our second bishops deedes, Which ha's yet no imployment in the Game, Perhaps nor euer shall, it may be wonne Without his motion, it rests in ours: He shall be flattered with Sede vacant, Make him beleeue he comes into his place, And that will fetch him with a vengance to vs. For I know powder is not more ambitious, When the match meet it, then his minde for mounting. As Couetous, and Leacherous. B. B. No more, now (Sir) both the sides fill. W. Ki. This ha's bin look't for long. F. B. The stronger sting it shootes into the bloud Of the blacke aduersary, I'm asham'd now, I was theirs euer, what a Lumpe was I? When I was led in ignorance and blindnesse? I must confesse I'ue all my life time playd The Foole, iill now. B Kt. And now he plaies two parts, the foole and knaue. F. B. Ther's my recantation in the last leafe. Wer't like a Ciceronian in pure Latain. W. B. Pure honesty, the better latain serues then, B. Kt. Out of those pestilent pamphlets those are they That wound our cause to the heart. B. B. Heere more anger yet. B. Kt. But we come well prouided for this storme. Enter both Houses W. Q. Is this my Pawne? she that should Guard our Person, Or some pale figure of deiection, Her shape vsurping, sorrow and affrightment, Has preuailed strangly with her. W. Q. p. King of Integrety, Queene of the same, and all the house professors Of noble Candor, vncorrupted iustice, And truth of heart, through my alone discouery (My life and honor wondrously preserued) I bring into your knowledge with my sufferings, Fearefull affrightments, and heart-killing terrors, The great incendiary of all Christendome, The absolute abuser of true sanctity, Fayrer peace, and holy order can be found In any part of th'vniuersall Globe: Who making meeke deuotion keep the doore, (His lips being full of holy zeale at first) Would haue committed a foule rape vppon me. W. Q. Hah? W. Ki. A rape? that's foule indeed, the very sound To our eare fowler then the offence it selfe To some Kings of the earth. W. Q. p. Sir, to proceede, Gladly I offered life to preserue honour, Which would not be accepted without both: The chiefe of his ill ayme being at mine honour, Till heauen was pleased by some vnlookt for accident, To giue me courage to redeeme my selfe. W. Ki. When we finde desperate sinnes In ill mens company, We place a charitable sorrow there; But custome and their leaprous inclination, Quits vs of wonder: for our expectation Is answered in their liues, but to finde sinne Vnder a robe of Sanctity, is able To draw all number to that monster onely, And leaue created monsters vnadmired, The pride of him that tooke first fall for pride, Is to be Angell shapt, and imitate The forme from whence he fell; but this offendor, Farre baser then sinnes maister, fix'd by vowe To holy order which is Angells method, It grieues me that my knowledge must be tainted, With his infested name, Oh rather with thy finger point him out. W. Q. p. The place that he should fill is void ray L. His guilt has scarde him, the blacke Bishops pawne. B. B. Hah, mine, my pawne? the glory of his order, The prime and president zealo: on the earth? Impudent pawne, for thy sake at this minute Modesty suffers, all that's vertuous blushes, And truths selfe like the sunne vext with a mist, Lookes red with anger. W. B. Be not thou drunke with rage too. B. B. Sober sincerite nor you a cup. Spake with Hypocrisie. W. Kt. You name their Bishop, But your own Christmas bole your mornings draught Next your Episcopall heart all the twelue dayes, Which smacke you cannot leaue all the yeare after. B. Kt. A shrew'd recorte Has made our Bishop smell of burning too, Would I stood farther off, wer't no impeachment To my honor or the game, wold they wold play faster. White Knight, ther's acknowledged from our house, A reuerence to you and a respect To that Lord Duke stands next you, with the fauour Of the white King, and th'afore-named respected, I combate with this cause, if withall speed Wast not one syllable, vnfortunate pawne) Of what I speake, thou dost not plead destruction A plea which will but faintly take thee off neither, From this Leuiathan scandall, that lyes rowling Vpon the Christall waters of deuotion, Or what may quit the more (though enough nothing) Fall downe, and foame, and by that pange discouer, The vexing spirit of falshood strongly within thee, Make thy selfe ready for perdition, Ther's no remoue in all the Game to scape it, This pawne or this, the Bishop, or my selfe Will take thee in the end, play how you can. W. Q. p. Spite of sins glorious ostentation; And all blood-threates, that thunder crackes of pride, Vshering a storme of malice house of impudence, Trust and Ã¦quiuocation, my true cause Shall keepe the path it treads in. B. Kt. I play thus then: Now in the hearing of this high assembly, Bring forth the time of this attempts conception. W. Q p. Conception? oh how tenderly you handle it. W. B. It seemes black Knight you are affraid to touch it. B. Kt. Well it's eruption, will she haue it so then? Or your white Bishop for her, the more vncleane; Vile and impious that you vrge the straine to, The greater will her shames heape now i'th'end, And the wronges meeke mans glory, the time (pawne.) W. Q. p. Yesterdayes cursed euening. B. Kt. Oh the treasure of my reuenge I cant spend all one thee, Ruine enough to spare for all thy kinred too, For honors sake call in more slanderers, I haue such plentifull confusion, I know not how to wast it, ile be nobler yet, And put her to her owne house: King of meeknesse Take the cause to thee, for our hands too heauy, Our proofes will fall vpon her like a Tower, And grinde het bones to powder. W. Q. p. What new engine, Ha's the diuell raysed in him now. B. Kt. Is it he, And that the time stands firme, now to your scandall, Pray do not shift your slander. W. Q. p. Shift your treachery, They'ue worne one suite too long. B. Kt. That holy man, So wrongfully accused by this lost pawne: H'as not beene seene these ten daies in these parts. W. Kt. How. B. Kt. Nay at this instant thirty leagues from hence. W. p. Fadomelesse falshood, will it scape vnblasted. W. K. Can you make this appeare? B. Kt. Light is not clearer, By his owne letters (most impartiall Monarch. W. Kt. p. How wrongfully may sacred vertue suffer, sir. B. Kt. Bishop we haue a treasure of that false heart. W. Ki. Step forth and reach those proofes. W. Q. p. Amazement couers me, Can I be forsaken of a cause So strong in truth and equity, will vertue Send me no ayde in this hard time of friendship. B. Kt. There's an infallible staffe and a red hat Reserued for you. W. Kt. p. Oh, sir, indeede. B. Kt. A staffe That will not easily breake, you may trust to't, And such a one had your corruption tired of, There's a state figge for you now. W. Ki. Behold all, How they were in one: I alwayes held a charity so good To holinesse profest I euer beleeued rather, The accuser false, you the professor vitious. B. Kt. A charity like all your vertues else, Gracious and glorious. W. Ki. Where sits the offence, Let the faults punishment be deriued from thence: We leaue her to your censure. B. Kt. Most iust Maiesty. W. Q. p. Calamity of vertue, my Queene leaues me too: Am I cast off as the Oliue casts her flower? Poore friendlesse innocence art thou left a prey, To the deuourer? W. Kt. Nor thou art not lost, Let em put on their bloodiest resolutions, If the faire policy I ayme at prospers: Thy counsell (noble Duke.) W. D. For that worke chiefely. VV. Kt. A man for speede now. W. B. p. Let it be my honor, sir, Make me that flight that owes my liues seruice. B. Kt. Was not this brought about well for our honours? B. B. Pish, the Galician braine can worke out wonders. B. Kt. Let's vse her, as vpon like discouery A mayde was vsed at Venice, euery one Be ready with a pennance being maiesty Vessell of foolish scandall, take thy fright Had beene in that Cabinet of nicenesse, Halfe the virginities the earth lockt vp, And all sweept at one cast by the dexterity Of a Iesuiticall Gamster, t'ad not valu'd The least part of that generall worth thou hast tainted. B. Ki. First I enioyne thee to a three daies fast for't. B. Q. You're too penurious, sir, ill make it foure. B. B. I to a twelue houres kneeling at one time. B. Kt. And in a roome fil'd all with Aretines pictures, (More then the twelue labours of Luxurie) Thou shalt not so much as the chast pummell see Of Lucrece dagger peeping, nay Ile punish thee For a discouerer, ile torment thy modesty. B. D. After that foure dayes last, into the inquisition house, Strengthned with bread and water for worse pennance. B. Kt. Why well sayd Duke of our house, nobly agriuated. W. Q. p.

I know my pen draws blood of the blacke house, Ther's neuer a booke I writ but their cause bleedes, It has lost many an ounce of reputation, Since I came to this side, I sticke deepe in, And leaue the Orifex gushing where I come: But where's my aduancement all this while I haue got, I'd haue some round peeferment, corpulent dignity That beares some breath and compasse in the guift on't, I am perswaded that this flesh would fit The biggest chayre Ecclesiasticall, If it were put to tryall, to be made Maister of an Hospitall, Is but a kind of disease bred honour: Or dreame of the poore almes Knights that weare badges, There's but two lazy beggerly preferments, In the white Kingdome, and I'ue got em both, My merrit does begin to be crop-sicke For want of other Titles. Enter blacke Knight. B. Kt. Oh here walke his fulsome holinesse: Now for the Maister-peece To vndo him euerlasting, that's put home, And make him hang in hell most seriously, That ieasted with an halter vpon me. F. B. The blacke Knight? I must looke to my play then. B. K. I bring faire greetings to your reuerend vertues, From Cardinall Paulus your most princely kinsman. F. B. Our princely kinsman sayth thou? we accept em: Pray keep your side and distance, I am chary Of my Episcopall person: I know the Knights walke in this Game too well, He may slip ouer me, and where am I then? B. Kt. There where thou shalt be Shortly, if arte faile not. The Letter. Right Reuererend and noble (meaning me) our true kinsman in affection, but alienated in blood, your vnkind disobedience to the mother cause, prooues the onely cause of your ill fortune at this time: My present remooue by generall election to the Papall dignity, bad now auspiciously setled you in my Sede vacante (now had it so) which at my next remooue, by death might proued, your step to supremacy. (Hah, all my bodies blood mounts to my face, To looke vpon this letter.) B. Kt. The pill workes with him, Thinke on't seriously it is not yet too late then, Through the submisse acknowledgment Of your disobedience, To be brotherly receiued into the louing Bosome of the Conclaue. F. B. This was the chayre of ease I euer aymed at, Ile make a bonfire of my bookes immediatly All, that are left against that side ile sacrifice: Packe vp my plate and goods, and steale away By night at Water-gate: It is but penning An other recantation, and in venting Two or three bitter bookes against the white house, And then I'me at other side agen, As firme as ere I was, as fat, and flourishing: Blacke Knight, expect a wonder ere't belong, Thou shalt see me one of the Blacke-house.

F. B. For beare, or I shall melt i'the place I stand, And let forth a fat Bishop in sad syrrop: Suffice I am yours, when they least dreame on't, Ambitious fodder, power and riches drawes me, When I smell honor, that's the locke of hay, That leads me throgh the worlds field euery way.

Here's a sweet paune to propogate beleefe on, Like the foundation of a Chappell layd Vpon a quagmire, I may number him now Amongst my inferior policies, and not shame em; But let me a little solace my designes With the remembrance of some braue ones past, To cherrish the futerrity of proiect, Whose motion must be restlesse till that great worke, Cald the possession of the world be ours: Was it not procured a gallant fleete, From the white Kingdome to secure our coasts, 'Gainst th'infidell Pyrats, vnder pretext Of more necessities expedition, Who made the Iayles flye open (without miracle) And let the Locusts out, those dangerous flyes Whose property's to burne Corne without touching The Heretique Granaries, feele it to this minute; And now they'ue got amongst the Country crops, They sticke so fast to the converted eares, The lowdest tempest that authority rowzes, Will hardly shake 'm off, they haue their dennes In Ladies Coaches, their safe groues and sennes: Nay were they followed and found out by th'sent Palme, oyle will make a Purseuant relent, Whose policy was't to put a silenc't muzle, On all the barking tong-men of the time: Mad pictures that were dumb enough before, Poore sufferers in that politicke restraint? (My light spleene skips, and shakes my ribs to thinke on't, Whilst our drift walkt vncensured, but in thought A whifle or a whisper, would be questioned, In the most fortunate Angle in the World, The Court has held the City by the Hornes, Whilst I haue milkt her: I haue got good soups too From Countries for their liberties, From some for their most vainly hop'd for preferments, High offices in th'ayre, I should not liue But for this mell acrim, this mirth Manna: My pawne? how now, the new's.

W. Ki. This blacke Knight Will neuer take any answere, 'tis a victory To make him vnderstand, he does amisse, When he knowes in his owne cleare vnderstanding, That he does nothing else, shew him the testimony Confirmed by good men, how that foule attempter, Got but this morning to the place from whence He dated his forged lines six daies past. B. Kt. Why may not the corruption sleep in this, By some connivence, as you haue walkt in ours, By too rash confidence. W. D. Ile vndertake That Knight shall teach the diuell how to lye. W. Kt. If sinne were halfe so wise as impudent, She'de neere seeke farther for an aduocate. En. B. Q. p. B. Q. p. Now to act treachery with an angels tong, Since all ours come out, ile bring him in strongly agen. Where is his iniur'd chastity? this goodnesse Whose worth no transitory prize can equall, This rocke of constant, and invinceable vertue, That made sinnes tempest weary of his fury. B. Q. What is my pawne destracted? B. Kt. I thinke rather Ther's some notable Maister-prize of rogary, This drumme strikes vp for. B. Q. p. Let me fall with reuerence, Before this blessed Altar. B. Q. This is madnesse. B. Kt. Marke the end, I stand for rogary still, I will not change my side. B. Q. p. I shall be tax'd I know, I care not what the blacke house thinkes of me. B. Q. What say you now? B. Kt. I will not be vnlayed yet. B. Q. p. How euer sensure flies, I honor sanctity, That is my obiect I intend no other, I saw this glorious, and most valiant vertue, Fight the most noblest combat with the diuell. B. Q. If both the Bishops had been there for seconds T'ad beene a compleate Diuell. W. Ki. Then thou heardst the violence intended? B. Q. p. Tis a truth, I ioy to iustifie I was an agent On vertues part, and rays'd that confused noyse, That started his attempt and gaue her liberty. W. Q. p. Oh 'tis a righteous story she has told (Sir) My life and fame stands mutually engage, Both to the truth and goodnesse of this pawne. W. Ki. Does it appeare to you, yet cleare as the Sun. B. Kt. Lasse I beleeued it long before 'twas done. B. Ki. Degenerate. B. Q. Base. B. B. Perfidious. B. D. Traytrous pawne. B. Q. p. What are you all besides your selues? B. Kt. But I remember that pawne. B. Q. p. May a fearefull barrennesse, Blast both my hopes and pleasures, if I brought not Her ruine in my pitty, a new trap For her more sure confusion. B. Kt. Haue I not won now, Did not I say 'twas craft, and machiuation? I smell conspiracie all the way it went, Although the messe were couered I'me so vs'd to't. B. Ki. That queene would I faine finger. B. Kt. You are too hasty (sir) If shee were tooke the Game would be ours quickly, My aymes, at that white Knight, t'entrap him first, The Duke will follow too. B. B. Would that Bishop were in my Diocesse, I'de soone change his whitenesse. B. Kt. (Sir) I could whip you vp a pawne imediatly, I know where my game stands. B. Ki. Do't suddainly, Aduantage least must not be lost in this play. B. Kt. Pawne, thou art ours. W. Kt. He's taken by default, By wilfull negligence, gard the sacred persons, Looke well to the white Bishop, for that pawne Gaue guard to the queene, and him in the third place. B. Kt. See what sure peece you locke your confidence in, I made this pawne heere by corruption ours, As soone as honour by creation yours, The whitenesse vpon him is but the leaprosly His vpper garment being taken off, he appeares blacke vnder. Of pure dissemulation: view him now, His heart and his intents are of our colour. VV. Ki. Most dangerous Hypocrite. W. D. One made against vs. W. Q. This truth of his complection. VV. Ki. Has my goodnesse, Clemency, loue, and fauour gracious rays'd thee From a condition next to popular labour, Tooke thee from all the dubitable hazards Of Fortune? her most vnsecure aduentures? And grafted thee into a branch of honour, And dost thou fall from the top bough by the rottennesse Of thy alone corruption, like a fruite That's ouer-ripned by the beames of fauour, Let thy owne weight reward thee. I haue forgot thee, Integrity of life is so deare to me, Where I finde falshood, or a crying trespasse, Be it in any whom our grace shines most on, I'de teare em from my heart. VV. B. Spoke like Heauens substitute. W. K. You haue him, we can spare him, and his shame Will make the rest looke better to their Game. B. Kt. The more cunning we must vse then. B. Kt. Wee shall match you, (Play how you can) perhaps, and make you too. F. B. Is there so much amazement spent on him That's but halfe blacke, there might be hope of that man; But how will this house wonder, if I stand forth And shew a whole one, instantly discouer One that's all blacke, where there's no hope at all. VV. Kt. Ile say, thy heart then iustifies thy bookes, I long for that discouery. F. B. Looke no farther then, Beare witnesse all the house I am the man, And turne my selfe into the blacke house freely, I am of this side now. W. Kt. Monster neere match him. B. Kt. This is your noble worke Knight. B. Kt. Now Ile halter him. F. B. Next newes you heare, expect my bookes against you, Printed at Doway, Bruxells, or Spolleta. VV. Ki. See his goods seaz'd on. F. B. Lasse, they were all conueyed Last night by water-gate, to a Taylors house: A friend of the Blacke house. W. Ki. A prepared Hypocrite. W. D. Premeditated turne-coate. Exeunt. F. B. Yes, rayle on, Ile reach you in my writings when I'me gone. B. Kt. Flatter him a while with honors till we put him Vpon some dangerous seruice, and then burne him. B. Ki. This came vnlookt for. B. D. How wee ioy to see you. F. B. Now Ile discouer all the white house to you. B. D. Indeed that will both reconcile and prayse you. W. Kt. p. I rest vpon you knight for my aduancement now, B. K. Oh for the staffe, the strong staffe that will hold, And the red hat fit for the guilty mazure, Into the empty bagge, know the first way, Pawnes that are lost, are euer out of play. W. K. p. How's this? B. Kt. No replication, you know me, No doubt e're long you'le haue more company, The bagge is big enough t'wil hold vs all. Ex. W. Q. p.

An absolute handsome Gentleman, a compleat one, You'de say so when you see him, heire to three red hats, Besides his generall hopes in the blacke house. W. Q. p. Sure thou art mistaken, for this man I haue promist single life to all my affections. B. Q p. Promise you what you will, or I, or all's one, There's fate rules vs, and ouer rules vs all me thinkes. W. Q. p. How came you to see or know this mistery. B. Q. p. A Magicall glasse I bought of an Egyptian, Whose stone retaines that speculatiue vertue, Presented the man to me, your name brings him As often as I vse it, and me thinkes I neuer haue enough person and postures: Are all so pleasing. W. Q. p. This is wondrous strange, The faculties of soule are still the same, I cannot feele one motion tend that way. B. Q. p. We doe not alwayes seeke, the faith wee liue by, Nor euer see our growth, yet both worke vpward. W. Q. p. It was well applied, but may I see him too. B Q. p. Surely you may, without all doubt or feare, Obseruing the right vse as I was taught it, Not looking backe, nor questioning the specter. W. Q. p. That's no hard obseruation, trust it With me, is't possible, I long to see this man. B. Q. p. Pray follow me then, And Ile ease you instantly. Exeunt. Enter blacke Iesting Pawne. B. I. p. I would so faine take one of these white pawnes now. I'de make him do all vnder drudgery, Feede him with ashes, milke, cromb'd with Goates cheese; And all the white meates can be deuised for him, So make him my white Iennet when I prance it, After the blacke knights litter. W. p. You'd looke then, Iust like the Diuell striding ouer a night mare, Made of a Millers daughter. B. p. A pox on you, were you so nigh, I'me taken Like a Blacke-bird in the great snow, this white Pawne grinning ouer me. W. p. And now because I will not foule my clothes Euer hereafter? for white quickly soyles you know. B. p. I prethe get thee gone, Then I shall smut thee. W. Q. p. Ile put that to venture, now I haue Snapt thee, thou shalt do all the durty drugery, That slauery was euer put too. B. p.

En. a second blacke pawne. 2. B p. Soft, soft you, you haue no such Bargaine on't, if you looke well about you. W. p. I'me snapt too, a blacke Pawne in the breech of me: Wee three looke like a bird spit, a white Chick Betweene two russet Wood-cockes. B. p. I'me glad of this. W. p. But you shall haue small cause, for ile firke you. 2. B. p. And ile firke you agen. W. p. And Ile firke you againe. B. p.

That boads good lucke still, Signe you shall chang state speedily: for that trembling Is alwayes the first symptome of a bride, For any vaine feares that may accompany His apparitian, by my truth to friendship I quite you of the least, neuer was obiect More gracefully presented, the very ayre Conspires to doe him honor, and treats Sweete vocall sinne as if a bride-groome enters: Which argues the blest harmony of your loues. W. p. And will the vsing of my name produce him, B. p. Nay of yours only, els the wonder halted, To cleare you of that doubt: ile put the difference In practise, the first thing I do, and make His inuocation in the name of others. W. Q. p. That will satisfie me much. B. Q. p. It shall be done. Thou with gentle forme and face, Fil'd lately this Egypted Glasse, By th'emperious powerfull name, And the Vniuersall fame, Of the mighty blacke House Queene, I coniure thee to be seene. What see you nothing yet? W. Q. p. Not any part: Pray try another. B. Q p. You shall haue your will; I double my commaund and power, And at the instant of this houre: Invoke thee in the white queenes name, VVith stay for time, and shape the same. What see you yet? W. Q. p. There's nothing shewes at all. B. Q. p. My truth reflects the clearer. Then now fix and blesse your fayre eye, With your owne for euer. Thou well compos'd by fates hand drawne; To enioy the white Queenes Pawne, Of whom thou shalt (by vertue meete) Many gracefull issues get: By the beauty of her fame, By the whitenesse of her name, By her faire and fruitfull loue, By her truth that mates the Doue, By the meeknesse of her minde, By the softnesse of her kinde, By the lusture of her grace, By all these thou'rt summond to this place. Harke how the ayre inchanted with your prayses, And his approach this words to sweet notes rayses. En. b. B p. in rich attire like an Aparitian, &amp; stands before the glasse then Exit. W. Q. p. Oh let him stay a while, a little longer. B. Q. p. That's a good hearing. W. Q. p. If he be mine, why shold he part so soone? B. Q. p. Why, this is but the shadow of yours: How do you? VV. Q. p. Oh, I did ill to giue consent to see it, What certainty is in our bloods our states? What we still write is blotted out by fates: Our wills are like a cause that is Law-tost, What one Court orders, is by another crost. B. Q. p. I find no fit place for this passion heere, Tis meerely an intruder, he is a Gentleman, Most wishfully composed, honor growes on him, And wealth pil'd vp for him, has youth enough too, And yet in the sobriety of his Countenance, Graue as a Tetrach, which is gracious Ith' eye of modest pleasure, where's the emptinesse, What can you more request. W. Q. p. I doe not know What answere yet to make, it doth require, A meeting 'twixt my feare and my desire. B. Q. p. Shee's caught, and which is strong, by her most wronger.

W. Kt. Most impious Epicures. B. Kt. We commend rather Of two extreames the parsimonie of Pertinax, Who had halfe Lettices set vp to serue againe, Or his successor Iulian, that would make Three meales of a leane Hare, and after sup With a greene fig, and wipe his beard (as we can) The old bewaylers of excesse, in those dayes Complain'd there were more coyne bid for a Cooke then for a Warre-horse; but now Cookes are Purchased after the rate of Tryumphant, and some Dishes after the rate of Cookes, which must needs Make some of th'white house gormandizers, especially Your welthy plump Plebians, like the Hogges Which Scaliger cites, that could not mooue for fat, So insensible of either pricke or goade, That Mice made holes to needle in their buttockes, And they nere felt em: There was once a Ruler Cyrenus Gouernour choackt with his owne paunch, Which death, fat Sanctius King of Castile, fearing Through his infinite masse of belly, rather chose To be kild suddainly, by a pernicious herbe Taken to make him leane, which old Cordeba King of Morocco counselled his feare too, Then hee would hazard to be stung to death, As that huge Cormorant that was choakt before him. W. Kt. Well you are as sound a spoakes-man for parsimony, And cleare abstinance, and scarce one meale a day, As euer spake with tongue. B. Ki. Censure him mildly (sir) 'twas but to find discourse. B. Q. Hee'le talke of any thing. W. Kt. I shall be halfe a fraide to feede hereafter. W. D. Or I beshrew my heart: for I feare fatnesse, The fogge of fatnesse as I feare a Dragon: The comlinesse I wish for, that's as glorious W. Kt. Your course is wondrous strict: I should transgresse (sir) Were I to change my side (as you haue much wrought me.) B. Kt. How you misprize? tis not ment to you-ward: You that are wound vp to the height of feeding, By clime and custome are dispenc'd withall, You may eate Kid, Cabrito, Calfe, and Ton's: Eate, and eate euery day, twice if you please. Nay, the frank'd hen, fatted with Milke and Corne, A ryot which the Inhabitants of Delos Were first inventers of: or the cramb'd Cockle. W. Kt. Well for the foode I'me happily resolued in; But for the dyet of my disposition, There comes a trouble you will hardly finde Food to please that. B. Kt. It must be a strange nature, VVe cannot finde a dish for't, hauing Policy (The Maister-Cooke of Christendome) to dresse it. Pray name your natures dyet. W. Kt. The first messe, is hot Ambition. B. Kt. That's but seru'd in puff-paste: Alas, the meanest of our Cardinalls Cookes Can dresse that dinner: Your Ambition (sir) Can fetch no further compasse then the World? W. Kt. Thats certaine (Sir.) B. Kt. Wee are about that already, And in the large feast of our vast Ambition, VVe count but the white Kingdome (whence you came from) The Garden for our Cooke, to picke his Sallads: The food's leane France larded with Germany; Before which comes the Graue, chast Signiory Of Venice, seru'd in (Capon-like) in VVhite-broth: From our chiefe Oven Italy the Bake-meates: Savoy the Salte: Geneua the chip'd Manchet. Below the Salte, the Netherlands are plac'd; A common dish at lower end a'th table, For meaner pride to fall too. For our second course, A spit of Portugals seru'd in for Plouers: Indians and Moores for blacke-birds: all this while Holland stands ready melted to make sawce, On all occasions, when the Voyder comes; And with such cheare our full hopes wee suffice, Zealand saies grace, for fashion then wee rise. W. Kt. Heere's meate enough in conscience for ambition. B. Kt. If there be any want there's Swisserland, Polonia, and such pickled things will serue To furnish out the table. VV. Kt. You say well (sir.) But here's the misery, when I ha stopt the mouth Of one vice, ther's another stands gaping for food: I'me as couetous as a barren wombe, The graue, or what's more rauenous? B. Kt. Wee're for you (sir) Call you that hanousnesse, that's good husbandry, Why when we make money of our faith, our prayers, We make the very death bed buy her comforts Most dearely pay for all her pious Councells, Leaue rich reuenewes for a few weake orizons: Or else they passe vnreconciled without em, Did you but view the vaults within our Monisteries, You'de sweare then Pluto (whom the fiction calls) The Lord of riches, were entomb'd there. VV. Kt. Is't possible. B. D. You cannot walke for Tuns. W. D. But how shall I bestow the vice I bring, sir, You quite forget me, I shall be shut out, By your strickt key of life. B. Kt. Is yours so vilde (Sir.) W. D. Some that are pleas'd to make a wanton on't, Call it infirmity of blood, flesh frailty; But certaine there's a worse name in your booke for't, B. Kt. The trifle of all vices, the meere innocent, The very nouice of this house of clay, verily If I but hug thee hard, I shew the worst on't, Tis all the fruite we haue here after supper: Nay, at the ruines of a Nunnery once, Six thousand Infants heads found in a fish-pond. VV. D. How? B. Kt. I, how? how came they thither thinke you? Huldricke Bishop of Ausberge in's Epistle To Nicholas the first, can tell you how, (May be hee was at cleansing of the pond) I can but smile to thinke, how it would puzzle All mother maides that euer liued in those parts, To know their owne childes head; but is this all? B. D. Are you ours yet? VV. Kt. One more, and I am silenc'st: But this that comes now will diuide vs questionlesse Tis ten times, ten times, worse then the fore-runners. B. Kt. Is it so vilde, there is no name ordain'd for't? Toads haue their titles, and creation gaue Serpents, and Adders those names to be knowne by. VV. Kt. This of all others beares the hidden'st poyson, The smoothest venome, I am an Arch-dissembler. B. Kt. How. W. Kt. Tis my natures brain turne from me (sir,) The time is yet to come, that ere I spoake What my heart meant. B. Kt. And call you that a vice: Auoide all prophanation, I beseech you; The onely prime-state vertue vppon earth, The policy of Empires, oh take heede (Sir) For feare it take displeasure and forsake you, Tis a Iewell of that precious vallue, Whose worth's not known, but to the skilful Lapidary The instrument that picks ope Princes hearts, And lockes vp ours from them, with the same motion: You neuer came so neere our soules till now. B. D. Now you're a brother to vs. B. Kt. What we haue done, has bin dissemblance euer. VV. Kt. There you lye then: And the Games ours, wee giue the checke mate By discouery, King the noblest mate of all. B. Ki. I'me lost, I'me taken. A great shoue and flourish. W. Kt. Ambitious, couetous, luxurious falshood. W. D. Dissembler, that includes all. B. Kt. All hopes confounded. B. Q. Miserable condition. Enter W. King, W. Queene with their Pawnes. W. Kt. Oh let my armes be blest, With this deare treasure, Truths glorious Master-peece, see Queene of sweetnes He's in my bosome safe, and this faire Stucture Of comely honor, his true blest assistant. VV. Q. May their Integrities euer possesse That powerfull Sanctuarie. VV. Kt. As 'twas a Game (Sir) Won with much hazard, so with much more triumph, I gaue him checke mate by discouery (sir.) VV. Ki. Obscurity is now the fittest fauour Falshood can sue for: it well suites Perdition, Tis their best course that so hath lost their fame, To put their heads into the Bagge for shame; And there behold the Bags mouth (like hell) opens The Bag opens, the B. B. slides in it. To take her due; and the lost sonnes appeare, Greedily gaping for increase of fellowship In infamy, the last desire of wretches Aduancing their perdition, branded fore-heads Like Envies issue, or a bed of Snakes. B. B. p. 'Tis too apparent the Game's lost, King taken. F. B. The white House has giuen vs the Bag (I thanke 'em) Iest. p. They'd neede haue giuen you a whole bag By your selfe, Sfoot this blacke Bishop has so ouer laid me, So squelch'd and squeasde mee, I haue no Verjuce Left in me, you shall find all my goodnesse if you Looke for't in the bottome of the Bagge. F. B. Thou Male-part Pawne, The Bishop must haue roome, he will haue roome, And roome to lie at pleasure. Iest. p. All the Bagge I thinke Is roome too little for your Spalletto paunch. B. B. p. Downe viper of our Order, I abhorre thee, Thou't shew thy whorish front. B. Q. p. Yes, monster Holinesse. VV. Kt. Contention in the bag? is hell deuided. VV. Ki. You'd need haue some of Maiesty and Power, To keepe good rule amongst you, make roome Bishop. F. B. I am not easily mooued, when I'me once set, I scorne to stirre for any King on earth. VV. Q. Here comes the Queene, what say you then to her? F. B. Indeede a Queene may make a Bishop stirre. VV. Kt. Roome for the greatest Machiauill Polititian, That the ere Diuell hatch'd of a Nuns-egge. F. B. He'le picke a hole in the bagge, and get out shortly: I'me sure to be the last man that creepes out; And thats the misery of greatnesse euer. VV. D. Roome for a sun-burn'd, Tanzy fac'd belou'd, An Oliue coloured Ganimed; and thats all Thats worth the bagging. F. B. Crowd in all you can, The Bishop will be still vppermost man Mauger King, Queene, or Polititian. VV. Ki. So let the Bagge close now (the fittest wombe For Treachery, Pride and Falshood, whilst we winner like) Destroying through Heauens power, what would destroy: Welcome our white Knight with loud peales of Ioy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. My Mistresse (the White Queene) hath sent me forth, And had me bow thus low, to all of Worth, That are true Friends of the White House and Cause, Which She hopes most of this assembly drawes: For any else, by Envies marke deuoted, To those night-Glow-wormes in the Bagge denoted; Where ere they sit, stand, or in priuate lurke, They'le be soone knowne by their deprauing worke: But She's assur'd, what they'le commit to bayne, Her white Friends hands will build vp faire againe.
