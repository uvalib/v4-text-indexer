      <field name="fulltext">VVit in a Constable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable his singular good Lord THOMAS LORD WENTWORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The PROLOGUE. You need not feare me Gentlemen, although I come thus arm'd; tis but to let you know I am in office; in my owne defence, And to secure me from the violence, Which might from you (who now my Iudges sit) Be off'red to this Trophee of my wit: And cause I know that you will obay Authority, I doe charge you, like the Play: Thinke who I am, how often I may catch You at ill houres in Tavernes, or ith' Watch; In Fraies sometimes; nay sometimes (not to trench Too much upon you) with a pretty wench. All this is possible, and Gentlemen, Consider how my rage will use you then, Jf you should now, as sure tis worth your feare, Be in the censure of my wit seuere, Vext I'me implacable; and though the Tribe Of Constables doe us't, Ile take no bribe To let you passe: These sturdy knaves will take Not the least mercy on you for my sake: Nor will the Iustice free you: (to your smart) You'le find, he and his Clarke will take my part. I can but gently warne you to prevent A danger, nay a certaine punishment, Should you dislike: for if the Play doe fall Vnder your votes, Ile apprehend you all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Are you resolv'd yet Gentlemen? I am In earnest haste of Towne-affaires, and came To know your minds: how's that? there's one I spye That will dislike, to th'Counter instantly With him; intreate Sir, shall not prevaile, Nor shall you thinke to come out upon baile. For in this case (believe it) I'de not spare (Though the sword were borne before him) my Lord Major; Nor should the Court of Aldermen reprieve For such a fact, my good friend Master Shreive. If so severe to them then, who by vow, Are my owne bretheren? what will become of you? I have consider'd; and will now commit To your free votes the Censures of my wit. For though their dulnesse (whom I've threatned) may Dislike (you 'ave wit) and will allow the play.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Scene London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scena prima. Enter Holdfast, Tristram. Holdfast. Did you ere we departed from the Colledge Orelooke my library? Trist. Yes sir, I spent two dayes in sorting Poets from Historians, As many nights in placing the divines On their owne chayres, I meane their shelves, and then In separating Philosophers from those people That kill men with a license: your Physitians Cost me a whole dayes labour, and I finde sir, Although you tell me learning is immortall, The paper and the parchment, tis contayn'd in, Savors of much mortality. Hold. I hope my bookes are all in health. Trict. In the same case the Mothes have left them, who have eaten more Authenticke learning then would richly furnish A hundred country pedants; yet the wormes Are not one letter wiser. Hold. I have beene idle Since I came up from Cambridge, goe to my stationer And bid him send me Swarez Metaphysickes, Tolet de anima is new forth, So are Granadas commentaries on Primum secundÃ¦ ThomÃ¦ Aquinatis, Get me the Lyricke Poets. Andâ Trist. I admire How he retaines these Authors names, of which He understands no sillable, 'twere better I bought the Authenticke Legend of Sir Bevis, Some six new Ballads and the famous Poems Writ by the learned waterman. Hold. Iohn Taylor, get me his nonsense. Trist. You meane all his workes sir. Hold. And a hundred of Bookers new Almanacks. Trist. And the divell to boot, Your fathers bookes in which he keeps th' accounts Of all his coyne will scarce yield crowns to afford Your fancy volums: why you have already Enough to furnish a new Vatican, A hundred country pedants can read dictats To their young pupills out of Setons logicke, Or Golius Ethicks, and make them arrive, Proficients learn'd enough in one bare twelmonth To instruct the parish they were borne in: you Out of an itch to this same foolish learning Bestow more money yearely upon bookes; Then would for convert sisters build an almes-house. Hold. You will displease my patience Tristram. Trist. I speake truth: if you shud want, your learning scarce would make you Capable of being town Cleark, or at best, To be a famous Tyrant unto boyes, And weare out birch upon them: or perchance you may arrive to be the City Poet, And send the little moysture of your braine To grace a Lord Maiors festivall with showes, Alluding to his trade, or to the company Of which he's free, these are the best preferments That can attend your learning. Hold. I say Tristram, the spirit of my learning stirs me up To give thee due correction. Trist. Would you study? as does young Thorowgood your noble Cosen, Not bookes, but men which are true living volums: You would like him, be held rich ith' esteeme Of all the illustrious wits that decke the city When the extent of your admirers is Confinde to fresh men: and such youths as only Know how to frame a syllogisme in Darij, And make the ignorant believe by Logicke The Moones made of a Holland Cheese: and the man in't. A swagbellied Dutch Burger Intrat Thorowgood. Thoro. Cosen Holdfast, a good day attend Thy learned piamater: prithee tell me How doe the Cabalists and antient Rabbins And thou agree? will they be sociable, And drinke their mornings draught of Helicon With thee: have they instructed you to prove yet That the world runs on wheeles? or that the sea May be drunke off by a shole of Whales? such things You know there are in nature. Hold. O far stranger. Thoro. Peace you booke-worme, Fit only to devour more paper then A thousand grand tobacco men or a legion Of boyes in pellets to their elderne gunnes. Dost thinke to live this life still? you're not now Amongst your cues at Cambridge, but in London, Come up to see your mistris beautious Clare, The glory of the city: goe and court her, As does become a gentleman of carriage, Without your Tropes and figures Inkerhorne termes, Fit only for a Mountebanke or Pedant, Or all your Physickes Metaphysickes and Meteors, (Tomes larger farre and more repleate with lies, Then Surius, Gallo-Belgcus, or the welsh Bard Geffrey Monmouth) shal be straight-way made Pitifull Martyrs. Hold. Why cosen I had thought. Thoro. Thy selfe an errant ideot, that's the fittest Thought for thy braine more dull then a fat Burgers, Or reverend countrey justices, whose wit Lies in his spruce clearkes standish, thou wert begot Surely ith' wane oth' Moone, when natures tooles Were at lame Vulcans forge a sharpening, thou art so lumpish. Trist. He has already spoyld His eyes with prying on Geneva prints, And small dutch Characters: his watching makes him Looke like a grand-child of old Errapaters, Some leane Astronomer, who to get ten shillings, For that's a large price for an Almanacke, Has wasted himselfe to the bignesse of his Iaccobs staffe, Which is so limber, 'tcannot stand to take height of Venus rising. Thoro. He sayes truth: besides your study has attain'd already, Learning enough to informe your minde the knowledge Of arts fit for a gentleman, wert not better For you my sprightfull senior to advance Your bever with a hatband of the last Edition in the Court, among the noblest Youthes of our nation, then to walke like Faustus, Or some high German conjurer, in a cap Fit for a Coster-monger, to weare your purple Or cut worke, band then this small snip of linning That's proper only for Tom Thum: or some of queen Mabs gentlemen-ushers. Trist. This Cassocke were a pretty garment for a fortune teller. Thoro. And this cloake of tinder comely for a ballad-seller, Life sir, you are borne here to an ample fortune, Your father absent knowes not how you've altered Your disposition: I must reclayme it, Thou shalt with me and court the beauteous Clare Reserv'd for thee, a purpose ith' meane time, Our chiefe companions, shall be wits more pure, Then your quicke sophisters, or slie logicians, Wee'l talke of the bright beauties of the age, Girles whose each looke deserves to be a theme For all the nimble poets, two dayes practise In our brave arts will teach thee to forget Philosophy as fruitlesse and abjure All other Ethicks, but what's usd mongst us, as most erronious. Hold. Well You shall perswade me, Ile be an errant asse, or any thing For thy sake coz, but shall we have such wenches As are at Cambridge, hansome as peg Larkin. Thoro. O farre before her, cosen thou shalt read Aretius Politicks, and Ovids Art, Shall be new read, thee and wee will refine Thy Academicke wit with bowles of wine. Hold. Tristram shall toth' Colledge and sell my bookes immediately. Thoro. Speake like the son of PhÅbus and my cosen. Trist. My studious master. Thoro. Sell thy Dictionary. Hold. Ile not keepe a prayer booke. Thoro. They are out of fashion. Hold. Nor a Calender, to looke the age oth' Moone in, Trist. be sure You burne Greens groats worth of wit; I scorne to keepe The name of wit about me. Trist. Tis confest sir, but for the numerous Rhemes of paper, which Are pil'd up in your study, give them mee, I have a brother in law ith' towne's a cooke, Ile give them him to put under his bake meates. Hold. Take them: I will not leave a pen within my lodging, I will forget to write, or set my hand to any thing. Thoro. Unlesse't be to a bond. Hold. Ile goe put this blest designe in execution, Cosen anon ile meet you at your chamber. Thoro. What in that reverend shape? the gentleman That I converse with, will believe thee some Itinerant Scholler, have thee whipt by th'statute. Hold. I would be loath, now I am past a fresh man to bee had into the buttries. Thoro. Still them termes? study to forget them, Ile send my Man to you with a new suite of mine I never wore yet, Be sure to put it on right, you mere Schollers Know no degree of garment above Serge, Or Satanisco: tie your band-strings neatly And doe not eat the buttons off, put not Your Cuffs both on one hand; twill tax your judgement Of new inventing fashions when accoustred, Come to my chamber, and Ile furnish you With language fit to accost your mistris. Hold. Rare, I've got more learning from him in halfe an houre, Then in a whole lifes practise out of bookes. Follow me Tristram, farewell deare cosen. Ex. Hold. Trist. Thoro. How I could laugh now, were my spleen large enough: a Hundred such lame stupid Ideots were enough, if marry'd, To precise Burgers daughters to replenish The city with a race of fooles, and root The stocke of knaves quite out of it, he loves books: Not that he has a scruple more of learning Then will suffice him to say grace, but like Some piteous cowards, who are oft thought valiant For keeping store of weapons in their chambers, He loves to be esteem'd a doctor by His volumnes: but I shall fit his schollership: whose these? Alderman Covets, Formall, by th'proportion: Ent. Formal and Clare. That rib of mans flesh should be Clare, dost heare My honest Cadis garters: who for care And close attendance on thy charge deserves To be grand porter to the great Turkes Seraglia: how hight that vayl'd damsell? Form. She has been at Britains burfe a buying pins &amp; needles To worke a night-cap for my master sir. Thor. Pox upon him, is not her name Clare, niece to Alderman Covet For. Her father was a country Squire of large revenew and her mother. Thoro. I shall be forc'd to heare him blaze her pedigree, Ide beat him, but that clubs and paring shovells oth' city Would be so busie about my eares: they'd spoyle My hearing two months after Gentle Lady Pardon my error if I doe mistake, are not you mistris Clare? Clar. Formall at last, would have resolv'd you, and I held my Peace of purpose, cause I knew his slow discovery would vex Your nimble patience Tho. You are a Gipsie, but does thy unkles humour hold of wedding His daughter to sir Timothy. Clar. Yes, or to young monsieur Holdfast whom he sayes is Learned enough to make Cheap-side a Colledge, And all the City a new Academy, but have you Thorowgood perform'd what I advis'd you to? Thoro. Yes, my girle: good Formall use thy motion to convay Thy ears a little farther off, there's mony To buy thee a new payre of garters: Clare Thou shalt no more behold me in the garbe And noble ornament I us'd to weare, my fashion shall be altred. Clar. To the schoolars, Young Holdfasts likenesse. Thoro. O by all meanes girle, thou shalt behold this comely hat transform'd To frugall brim, and steeple crowne, this band Of faire extent chang'd to a moderne cut, Narrower then a precisians: all this gay And gawdy silke J will convert to Serge Of limber length: like some spruce student (newly Exalted for saying grace well, to be fellow Oth' Colledge he had studied) I will Salute thy reverent Uncles spectacles, And without feare of his gold chaine, ile woe thee In metaphores and tropes Scholastick till The doting Senator with a liberall hand give Thee his dainty darling to become my spouse inseparable. Clar. This suites well with my directions. Thoro. True girle true, farewell Clare, I kisse thy white hand: Sir resume your charge, I've done my errand: let not your old Sir Amias, Know of this conference, if you doe, that twist Of spinners thred, on which your life depends Exe. Clare. &amp; Formall. Shall be shorne off like a horse mane. Farewell. Form. Mans life indeed is but a thred, good day sir. Ent. Valentine &amp; Sir Timothy. Thor. Attend your charge friend, Valentine, Sir Timothy. You'r well incountred, may I inquire the affaire Which happily has brought you up toth' City? Thoro. May I know it? is't not to purchase a Monopoly For Salt and Herrings? for state businesse, Unlesse it be to see the great new ship, Or Lincolns Inne fields built: I'me sure you none here. Tim. Very right sir. Thor. But for thee: my noble man of merit, thou art welcome, Weel be as kind to one another boy, And witty as brisque poets in their wine, Weel court the blacke browd beauties of the time, And have by them the height of our desires: with ease accomplished Val. Noble Thorowgood, Did I not owne you by the name of friend, Already these indearments would ingage me to beg that title. Tim. Very right, and me too. Thor. You sir, you've reason, I know you for the most Egregious knight In all the country. Tim. Very right, I am indeed esteem'd so. Thor. One that live on Onions and Corne-sallets. Tim. Right agen, Sure he can conjure, I had one to my breakefast. Thor. Nay no Herald Can better blase your pedigree. I've heard Your father my most worthy knight, was one That died a knave to leave you so. Tim. Passing right still. Thor. And pray right witty, and right honor'd sir, What may your businesse seeme to be ith' city, Are you come up to learne new fashions? Tim. Exceeding right agen. Thor. To change this ancient garment to a new one Of a more spruce edition. Val. Yes, but before, For I am privie unto all's intentions, He means to see and court his mistris. Thor. Who's that? my doughty Impe of spur and sword, Some faire Dulcina de Toboso. Val. No, tis Grace, daughter to Alderman Covet. Thor. I doe commend thee my deare Don, and will Be thy assistant, goe and see thy horse drest, And then approach my chamber. Tim. Very right, I kisse your fingers ends. Ex. Timothy. Thor. Doe you, Valentine, know The Lady he intends to Court. Val. Onely by report, Which speakes her most accomplish'd. Thor. Oh she'll make An excellent Asse of him: she has a wit More sharpe and piercing than a Waspes sting, she speaks All fire; each word is able to burne up A thousand such poore Mushromes: had her mother Not beene held honest, I should have believ'd She'd bin some Courtiers By-blow, or that some Quicke Poet got her. Val. How's her feature? Thor. Rare, past expression, singular, her eyes The very sphears of love, her cheeks his throne, Her lips his paradise, and then her minde Js farre more excellent than her shape. Val. You give her a brave Character; is't possible To have a sight of her? Tho. Yes, by my means, scarce otherwise wilt thou have her, Speake but a syllable, 't shall be perform'd As sure as if Don Hymen, in his robes Had ratifi'd the contract. Val. You are merry sir. Thor. When didst thou know me otherwise: yet now In sober sadnesse friend, couldst thou affect A woman, as there's few of them worth loving, Thou canst not make a nobler choise: Ile bring thee Onto the skirmish, but if thou retreat, Beat backe by th'hot Artillery of her wit, Which will play fast upon thee: maist thou live To be enamour'd on some stale Hay, or Matron Of fourescore, that may congeale thee to a frost Sooner than forty winters: or be wed To an insatiat Chamber-maid. Val. Defend me From thy last curse; feare not my valour. Thor. This foole shall serve both her and us for sport: Lets to our taske; and if our project hit, Ile sweare all fortune is compris'd in wit.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Scena prima. Covet, Clara, Maudlin. Cov. You will provoke me. Clar. No matter: Although you be my uncle, and so nature Binds me to observe you, ile not be oblig'd To what the phlegmaticke humour of your age Strives to enforce upon me: I was borne Free, an inheritresse to an ample fortune, Of which you doe pervert the use, and trust me, Ile be no longer tame and suffer it. Cov. Suffer what? you're us'd Too well: if you complaine of this, I shall Study to be more harsh. Clar. Doe; you shall not, as you had wont, Thinke to attire me in blacke Grogram, Daub'd o're with Sattin lace, as if I were Daughter, and heire apparent to a Tayler, Who from the holiday Gownes of sixe neat fish-wives Had stole the remnants made the thrifty garment. Nor shal you sir (as tis a frequent custome, Cause you're a worthy Alderman of a Ward) Feed me with Custard, and perpetuall White-broth, Sent from the Lord Majors, or the Shriefes feast, And here preserv'd ten dayes, (as twere in pickle) Till a new dinner from the common hall Supply the large defect. Cov. You'll leave this language? Clar. Leave to use me so then: Y'ave made my selfe, your daughter, and my woman, Sup with a penyworth of Lettice, under Pretence 'twould make us sleep well: your full morsells (Had not the vertue of Clay wall, and Oatmeale Preserv'd my maid) ere this she'd bin shrunk up To th'bignesse of a Squirrill. Maud. Any Dwarfe might without stretching his small fingers, have Spand me about the waste. Clar. Nor shall you, (As sure tis your intention) marry me To th'quondam fore-man of your shop, (exalted To be your Cash-keeper) a limber fellow, Fit onely for deare Nan, his schoole-fellow, A Grocers daughter, borne in Bread-street, with Whom he has used to goe to Pimblico, And spend ten groats in Cakes and Christian Ale, And by the way has courted her with fragments, Stoln from the learned Legends of Knights Errants, Or from the glory of her fathers trade, The Knight o' the Burning Pestle. Cov. Sure the Devill Has entred her ith' likenesse of an Eele, Her tongue's so slippery: Minionâ Clar. Ile not be frighted As are your Prentises, with Little ease, Or shewing them the Beadle. In plain termes, I doe not meane to incorporate with a Salter, Or any of those thriving trades, to have My shooes lickt o're each saturday night By th'under prentise; they shine so brightly With soot and kitching-stuffe, that I next morning May spare my glasse, and dresse my head by their Greasie reflection: yet let me tell you, I must be marry'd instantly a virgin: Of my full age, setting aside all nicenesse May justly claime a husband. Cov. Have but patience, ile wed thee to a Knight. Clare. What is hee, one oth' Post sir, or some such As was in the old famous Ballad mention'd: He that has forty pounds per annum, by Which Charter I should be undutifull, And take the wall of my ag'd Grandame: No, Ile have a Courtly gentleman, whose wit Shall equall his estate, and that so large, As't shall afford me a sufficient joyncture. Cov. This Knight shall do't, or if you like not him, What say you to Sir Geffery Holdfast's sonne, The famous Schollar? Clare. If he be a Parson; And I his wife, I sure shall make my friends Lucky to horse-flesh: No, I will have one That shall maintaine my Coach, and foure faire horses: Not such thin jades, nor such a crazy Chariot, As i've seene us'd by Citizens to convey Their wives with leisure to their Country houses, (For feare the late Plum-pudding they had eaten Fryed to their Breakfast, should with too much jogging Broyle on their queasie stomacks) One that shall Maintaine me a Sedan, and two strong varlets, That so I may not need the Common men Mules, With their wood-Litters, with nineteene at end of them, The usuall shelters, which the Gallants carry Their wenches to their Chambers in: In briefe, If you can find me any where a husband That I can like, I will allow your choyse; If not, ile take my owne; so good day to you. Pray meditate upon it. Ex. Clare, Maud: Cov. This is the maddest wench: would I were rid of her, She vexes me more than her Portion's worth; But if she stoope not to my Country Knight, Sir Timothy Shallow-wit, or to young Holdfast, (Whom I had rather marry to my daughter) She shall ha grasing. Enter Formall. For. Sir, there are a brace of gentlemen without, Desire admittance to you. Cov. Let them enter. For. I shall denote your pleasure. Ex. For. Cov. Some young heires, To borrow money upon Morgages. Enter Holdfast, Brave, Tristram. Hol. I shall observe my Cosens rule, nere fear me. Cov. Save you sir. Hol. You do not think me damn'd sir, you bestow That salutation on me. Cov. Good sir no. Whom would you speake with here? Hol. Sir, my discourse Poynts at one Alderman Covet. Cov. I am the party. Hol. Good Mr. Covet, I covet your acquaintance: I understand you have a daughter is Of most unknowne perfections. Cov. She is as heaven made her. Hold. She goes naked then, The Tailer has no hand in her; may I see her? Cov. I must desire your name first. Hold. My name is Holdfast. Cov. Sonne to sir Geff. Holdfast. Hold. His proper sonne and heire, and I am come To see your Daughter and your Neece. Cov. Came you from Cambridge lately. Hold. I come from Cambridge: What do you see in these my looks, should make you Judge me such a Coxecombe. Cov. Your father writ me word, his son that should Come up to see my Daughter and my Neece, Was a rare schollar, wholly given to's bookes. Hold. My father was an arrant asse for's labour, I ne're read book in all my life, except The Counter scuffle, or the merry Gossips, Raynard the Foxe, Tom Thumbe, or Gargan tua, And those i've quite forgotten: I a schollar! He lyes in's throat that told you so. Trist. On my Conscience You may believe him: he scarce ere saw booke, Vnlesse the Chronicle in an iron Chaine, In's fathers Hall: for learning sir, except What's in a Horse, a Hawke, or hownd, he knowes not How to expound your meaning. Cov. I mar'le sir Geff. knowing my aversion From any of these courses, should bring up His sonne to all of them: nay, write me word, Knowing my love to learning, he had him A schollar purposely: pray sir resolve me, Are you sir Gefferies sonne? Hold. I am a Bastard else. Cov. Sir Gefferies sonne of Eppinge? Hold. Yes, of Eppinge, One that will venture five hundred pounds upon his horse, Soone as the proudest hee that lives in London, Ile play my Crop-eare 'gainst my Lord Majors Steed, And all his furniture: I doe intend To scoure Hide Parke this summer. Trist. didst give him His Oates this morning? Shall I see your daughter. Did he drink's water hastily? Your Neece I'de be acquainted with. Cov. Sir, you must pardon me, you're not the man I tooke you for. Hold. You did not take me for an Asse I hope. Cov. O by no meanes, but they cannot be seene Conveniently this morning: another time, At your best leasure, I shall not deny you. Please you walke in, and taste our Beere? Hold. I know 'tis but oth' sixes; and I hate Liquor of that complexion: pray commend me To both my sweet-hearts. Tristram come lets backe, And, as my Cosen sayes, drinke lusty sacke. Exeunt Holdfast and Tristram. Cov. There's some deceite in this, perhaps some gallant, Knowing my purpose with Sir Geffery Holdfast, Has tane his name upon him: ile dispatch A messenger straight to him: whom have we here? Enter Thoroug. and Formall. Form. Sir, that's the Alderman my Master. Thor: Is this the venerable Man, to whom This goodly Mansion is impropriate: I should negotiate with his reverence About authentick businesse. Cov: This rather Should be sir Geff. sonne, his words and habit Speake him most learned. I'me the person, pray Let me be bold to crave your name. Thor. My appellation or pronomen, as (It is tearm'd by the Latins) is hight Ieremie, But my Cognomen, as the English gather, Is called Holdfast. Cov. This is he certainely; are you, I pray Sir Gefferies sonne of Eppinge? Thor. The Nominalls, the Thomists, all the sects Of old and moderne Schoole-men, doe oblige me, To pay to that Sir Geffery fillial duty. Cov. I'me glad to heare it, tother was some varlet, I shall finde out and punish: Sir, y'are welcome; I gesse your businesse; tis about a match, Or with my Neece, or Daughter: which you like, Shall be at your dispose: if not, your businesse. Thor. My businesse is of procreation, or as The Civill Lawyers learnedly doe paraphrase, Is of concomitance, Cohabitation, Or what you please to terme it. Cov. How am I blest, that this rare schollar shall Be match'd into my family? Within there; Neece, Daughter, both come hither. Thor. One at once sir, Twill satisfie; the Canon does prohibit Us Polygamy. Enter Clara, Gray. Cov. Sir, this is my onely daughter, this my neece, Pray know them better. Thor. Faire types, nay Orbs of beauty, J salute you, Each in his proper altitude. Graie. Heyday, this is some Fortune-teller. Clare. Tis Thorowgood, you must not seeme to know him. Cov. Daughter and Neece, this is a gentleman, My care has pick'd out, as a most fit husband For one of you; which he can soonest fancy, Heare him but speake, and he will put you downe Ten Universities, and Jnnes of Court, Jn twentie sillables. Good Mr. Holdfast Speake learnedly to th'wenches; though J say't, They have both good capacities. Thor. Most rubicund, stelliferous splendant Ladyes, The ocular faculties, by which the beames Of love are darted into every soule, Or humane essence, have into my breast Convey'd this Ladies lustre: and J can Admire no other object; therefore beauty Your pardon, if J onely doe addresse In termes Scholasticke, and in Metaphors My phrase to her. Graie. J shall not Envy my Cosens happinesse. Thor. Y'are full of Candor; Jf you will love me Lady, ile approach your eares, Not in a garbe Domesticke, or termes vulgar, But hourely change my language, court you now, In the Chaldean, or Arabicke tongues, Expound the Talmud to you, and the Rabbines, Then read the Dialect of the Alanits, Or Ezion Gebor, which the people use Five leagues beyond the Sun-rising, in stead Of pages to attend you, I will bring Sects of Philosophers and queint Logicians, Weel Procreat by learned art, and I Will generate new broods of Schollers on you, Which shall defend opinions far more various Then all the Sectaries of Amsterdam Have ever vented. Covet. Learned, learned young man, How happy am I in thee? Thor. Doe but love, Ile call the Muses from the sacred hill To Enucleat your beauty: I my selfe (After in loftier numbers I have sung Your fam'd Encomiums) will convert to poet, And for your sake Ile write the city annals, In famous meter which shall far surpasse Sir Guy of Warwickes history: or Iohn Stows upon The custard with the foure and twenty Nooks At my Lord Majors feast. Cov. How am I ravisht! Thor. Whose brave show hereafter Shall be no more set forth with stalking pageants, Nor children ride for angels nor lowd actors Pronounce bold speeches, I will teach his Henchboyes Serjeants and trumpeters to act and save The city all that charges: Nay Ile make a new Found engin; which without fire shall keepe his Whitebroath warm til his return from Westminster Nor shall the Aldermens daughters, who have Dreamt at least six nights before of guilded Marchpane, forfeit their serious longing: Ile have Horses with their Saint Georges on them, that shall gallop Into their handkerchers. Clar. You promise wonders. Covet. Hold your tongue, hees able To performe more by's learning. Thor. The crosse And standerd in Cheapeside I will convert To Hercules pillars: and the little conduit That weepes in lamentation for the Church, Remov'd that did leane on, it shall be still Like the great tun at Heidleberge fild with wine, And alwayes running, that the prentises Shall not on Sundayes need to frequent Tauerns, And forfeit their indentures. Covet. Still more miraculous. Thor. The great conduit Shall be a magezin of sacke, and Smithfield A Romish Cirque or Grecian Hippodrom, My Lord Maiors gennet shall not die without An Elegy, nor any cittizen breake, But have a dolefull ditty writ upon him. Val. Save you gentlemen. Covet. Noble sir Timothy, and your friend both Welcome, this is my neice, &amp; that my daughter, pray Be pleas'd to know them, Sir honor me to walke, I'de have some private conference with you, The house sir Timothy is at your command. Grace. Cosen what would these gentlemen? Clare. Truth I know not, Ile venture my discretion to his nose there, And that appeares a rich one, they are two Country Ideots whom thy father would Put upon us for husbands. Grace. Very likely, Pray gentlemen your businesse. Tim. Speak for me Valentine. Val. Ladies wee'r come to see you, fame does give You the attribute of faire and witty. Clare. Yet our wits you see sir will not serve to keepe Fooles from our company. Tim. Very right yfaith. Val. That tartnesse Becomes you prettily, and might serve to fright Young linnen-drapers or some millaner That does with gloves and bracelets stolne from's Master court you, a haberdasher would have shak'd His blocke-head (as if he had beene trying a Dutch Felt out) and with a shrug departed, but we are Gentlemen Ladies, and no city foremen That never dare be ventrous on a beauty, Unlesse when wenches take them up at playes To intice them at the next licentious Taverne To spend a supper on them, we are creatures Deserve you at your best and noblest value, And so expect you'l use us. Tim. Very right, this is A countrey gentleman my neighbor I, A trusty and coragious country knight. Clare. I doe believe you sir, your face does tel me, You'r one that feed on bacon and bagpudding, Your nose by its complexion does betray Your frequent drinking country Ale with lant in't, Have you no hobnayls in your boots, driven in To save the precious leather from the stones That pave the streets of London. Grace. Is not sir your Cloake new turn'd, the aged three pil'd velvet Was not your grandams peticote this jetkin Made by your grandsire at his first translation From Clowne to Gentleman, and since reserv'd An heire long to the family, and this sword The parish weapon? Tim. Very right agen. Clare. Now for you sir. Who of two fooles doe yet appeare the wisest, Can your ingenious noddle thinke that we Bred in the various pleasures of the city, Would for your sake turne beasts and grase ith' country, We cannot milke, make wholsome cheese, nor butter, And sell it at next market and lay up Out of the precious Income as much coyne In thred bare groates, mill-sixpences, and pence, As will suffice to finde the house in Candles And Sope a twelve month after. Grace. Nor can wee Spin our owne smockes out of the flax which growes Behind your Dovehouse, no, nor card the wooll Must make us peticoates things (to say truth) Not worth the taking up. Val. They've Magicke in their tounges They have so daunted me, I thinke I shall Turne foole and get me? hem without reply. Clare. All the company, We can injoy there is each day to walke To the next farmers wife, whose whole discourse Is what price Barly beares, or how her husband Sould his last yoake of Oxen: other meetings We cannot have, except it be at Churchales, When the sweet bag-pipe does draw forth the Damsells to frisque about the May poles, or at Weddings, where the best cheare is, wholsome Stewd broth made of legs of porke and turnips. Grace. Yes, at Christnings, where the good Wives, stead of burnt Wine and Comfets, Drinke healths to th'memory of all christian soules In Ale, scarce three houres old: eat cakes more tough Then glew or farthing ginger bread: then talke Of the last Blasing-Starre, or some new monster: Then drinke, and cry heaven blesse us from the Spaniard, While the learn'd Vicars wife expounds the Ballad Of 'twas a Ladies daughter in Paris properly, And so breakes up the wise assembly. Ual. And you That are the precious paragons of the City, Who scorne these harmelesse sports: can have your meetings At Islington, and Green Goose faire, and sip A zealous glasse of Wine till the parch'd floore Be moistned with your virgin dew, then prattle How that you dreamt last night that Iohn the Mercer, Or Tom the Drapers man at London-stone Was in your bed, and what sweet work he made there. Tim. Very right, and kis'd you oftner Then ere the good man did his Cow, and hug'd you As the Divell hug'd the Witch, that's right now. Val. When you'r married (For that you will be, or else run away With Costermongers, Mountebankes, or Taylors) Your husbands are more subject to you then Their bondmen are, whom by profuse expense You breake beyond redemption from the Indies; the Straights, or Barbary, see them lodged in Ludgate, And then turne pricking semsters, till that trade Fayling, you take your selves (as to the last refuge) To the old occupation; till the Marshall Carry you to Bridewell, of which you'r free, Even by your fathers charters that have beene Sometimes the masters of it, there Ile leave you, So farewell wildcats. Tim. Very right as I am a gentleman. Grace. I like his spirit well Clare, such a fellow Or none shall be my husband. Enter Thorowgood. Thor. helpe me to laugh good wenches, I haue talk'd Thy Unckle Clare into so free an humour, That hees resolv'd straight to take forth the licence, And marry us ith' morning. Clare. What od fellow's this? Know you him Cosen Grace. Thor. Prethee good wit noe more, we've overcome All forraigne enemies and tis unfit To war among ourselves. Grace. This is the pedant My father brought to mocke us, good thine stuffe, Get thee home to thy parish, And instruct Thy people wholesome Doctrine, for us, We have no zeale to learne. Thor. Life they'l perswade me out of my selfe, Clare, Grace, know you not me, not Thorowgood. Amb. Thorowgood, pray put your trickes on some body, More easie to be wrought on, Thorowgood, Ha, ha, ha. Exe. Thor. What should those wenches meane, the five and sheares Cannot resolve this mystery: they know me Better then I can know my selfe: 'twas she Advis'd me to this habit to deceive Her uncles prying eyes, and why then Should they abuse me thus? the rest were made But fooles in Quarto, but I finde my selfe An asse in Folio: Ile away, and if I quit them not with an abuse as fine, Ile say there is no quickning spirit in wine.

You may endeavor With the large talent of your masculine wit To exceed their female sharpnesse you shall finde, Though you firme and stiffe in your defence, These city lasses able to take downe Your most couragious fury: pray endeavour't. Know. That gentleman, were to usurpe your presence, I finde no inclination, yet I thanke you, To rest a foole upon record as you doe. Val. How's that, my impe of understanding? Know. By being so egregiously abus'd By two poore City infants, things that never Have heard wit nam'd, unlesse 'twas when their father Has cal'd his Formall foreman, witty varlet, For cheating hansomely, had they been some Illustrious dames, the glory of Cheape-side, Stars of the City, that are daily haunted By this great Lord that courtly kisse their gossips, It had beene possible their conversation Might have instild into them so much language And wit sufficient to withstand the assaults Of some young Innes a courtman. Thor. Yes, who never Had mooted in the hall or seen the revels Kept in the house at Christmas. Know. Some such gamster might have Come oft with credit, though hee'd ventur'd His whole estate of wit on them and lost it, But you the rookes oth' age to be ored one At your owne game by city girles. Val. Thou art an asse, A very coxcomb, there are girles ith' City Able to oredoe at their owne game a hundred Such feeble fellows as thy selfe, but Thorowgood, Leaving this infidell to his mis-beliefe, Are you resolved that I shall undertake The new designe we plotted? Thor. With what speed Can be convenient, sir Timothy Shall be our instrument. Know. If there be wit in't, Honour me to assist you. Thor. A revenge Upon these peevish wenches, one of them Loves me intirely, nay has vow'd me a marriage, And did advise me to assume this shape, To cheat her uncle. Val.

Cosen, cosen, you will not leave me thus? I pray let me goe sir. Val. Thus farre into my armes girle, that's the place Thou oughtst to rest in: you expect I warrant That I should court you now, and with an armie Of oathes, stuft with as many finicall falsehoods, Protest I love you: by this light I know not, Tis folly to dissemble, whether or no I can affect thee; yet thou seemst to weare That pretty harmlesse innocence in thy lookes, It wins my credulous thoughts to believe Thou maist be vertuous. Grace. Sir, I hope my owne Too forward zeale, in tendring you my love, Will not in your good thoughts beget an ill Opinion of my modesty. Val. Never fear't: That freenesse more engages my just faith To embrace thy affection. I have seene some Ladyes, Coy as a Voteresse below their suiters, Yet with a tough-backt groome, have knowne them sin With most libidinous appetite in private; But J me as fearelesse girle, that ought amisse Can staine thy soule, as thou wert confident In setling thy most constant choise upon A stranger; yet J must desire the reason Why you did love me: for my owne good parts, Certaine they're not so attractive as to conquer A beautie at first sight. Grace. Since I have Disclos'd my affection to you, (although love Oft times admits no reason) ile endeavour To satisfie your question: the first cause Moov'd me to love you, was my father. Val. Hang thy father In's owne gold chaine: but such another word, And never hope to have me; dost thou thinke Ile be beholding to an eight ith' hundred, To such an empty caske as is thy father, (Who soon did get his wealth by the old proverbe Of fooles have fortune) for a wife; but that I have some mercy in me to believe Thou maist be virtuous; I would not match With any of my squeamish Ants of London, For all the wealth ith' Chamber. Grace. Sir, you ask'd, A question of me, and will not permit Me give a civill answer; as I said, My fatherâ Val. Father agen, farewell; my eares doe blister At the harsh sound: would thou hadst beene a Bastard, So thou hadst no title to his blood: Another father, like a whirlewind, blowes me Hence from thy sight for ever. Gra. Pray heare me. Intends to match me to Sir Timothy Shallow-wit, a creature onely fit for scorne; Which to prevent, and taken with the fulnesse Of your true worth, I rather chuse to cast My reputation on your noble pitty, Than stand the desperate hazard of my ruine. Ual. She loves me by this light, this is no tricke. Now to my Thorowgoods project: th'art a good wench, A harmlesse wench, and I believe a sound one, And I will have thee; give me thy hand: yet stay, Ere I doe cast my selfe away upon thee, You here shall promise Mistris, to become A most obedient wife, and not according To th'ancient tricke inherent to the City, Raile till you be my Master. Grace. Never feare me. Val. Nor shall you, when you're at my house ith' Country Be niggardly, or spoyle a dinner for Want of the tother ounce of Sugar, nor Repine to see me merry with my friends, Or curse my brothers, when they so journe with me, Nor starve my servants when I am from home. I must be drunke sometimes too, then you must not Whine and cry out, were I a maid agen, Ide never marry any that does take This wicked Herbe Tobacco. Those injunctions, And some few hundreds more of the same nature, Seald and deliver'd to me by your promise, I may be wonne to wed thee, nay to bed thee, And get a race of such Heroicke children, As shall intice posterity to conceive Some good came from Cheapside. Your lip shall seale this. Grace. You see your strengths upon me. Val. Tis my good girle: Thy father, armed with the trained bands o'th City, Shall never pull thee from me: to confirme thee How much I love, ile disclose a plot I had to gaine thy affection. Grace. Tis some good one, Pray let me heare it. Val. You see my youth and feature will admit A womans Character; if I were cloath'd But in the habit, should I not appeare A bouncing Mary Ambry?. Grace. Some such creature; but to your project. Val. I have prepar'd mee A handsome female-shape, my man without Has them under his cloake; and I perswaded Sir Timothy, in hope that I would court thee I his behalfe, to have presented me Here for his Neece; you marke me. Grace. Very well; but now This the designe is uselesse. Val. By no meanes; It must be put in action: come goe in, And helpe to dresse me: Sir Timothy expects To meete me in that shape here: and besides In that disguise, secure I can at any time Steale out with you, and marry you. Gra. Your reason Shall governe my obedience. Val. Come let's in then. Enter Timothy, Covet, Formall. Tim. Tis very right that sir, but yet methinkes A wholsome song, sung to a fine new tune, Should not be much a misse: my boy here has one, And Ide be very loath, although I cannot Sing, as they say, my selfe, that she should heare What those, I can keep, can doe; is not this right now? Cov. Your pleasure shall prevaile, though to say truth, Sonne Shallow-wit, for sonne I still shall call you, I never lik'd a Song, unlesse the Ballad Oth' famous London Prentice, or the building Of Britaines Burse: for Musicke, lesse the Virginalls, I never car'd for any. Does but cloy The eares, but never fills the purse sonne. Tim. Very right indeed; tis too light For such a purpose. Form. With your leave sir, Musicke is most delightfull, and young Mistris Grace, and her Cosen surely will receive it With thankfull Equipage. Tim. Honest Formall, Th'art in the right still; come exalt thy voyce My little Impe of gut and haire: My Mistris Shall know there's something in me. How doe you Sings. Like it? Form. Tis very odoriferous.

Mrs. your Cosen does desire some conference with you. Cov. Maudlin, Did there a Gentlewoman arrive here lately, To see my daughter? Maud. There is one within, In busie conference with her. Tim. Very right that, he's pleading for me now. Faire Damsell that's my Neece; pray tell her, here's A Knight, a simple Uncle of hers, or so, desires her Company. But here she comes, my Mistris with her; Neece Tis well done, ile give thee the tother thousand to increase Thy portion for't: Mistris, and how, and how do'yee like my Neece, a plaine Country girle, or so. Cov. A very handsome woman, I could love her, Did I but know her portion. Mistris welcome. Whats in that house is yours? Grace. Sir Timothy, You have much grac'd me by the sweet acquaintance Of this good gentlewoman. Pray Cosen know her; She's worthy your endearment. Clare. I shall be proud To doe you service. Val.

They are both sparkes, that's certaine, if ere I take them in my watch, Ile make them stoope Under my staffe of office, Mistris Clare, Though I'me a Citizen, and by my charter, Am not allowed much wit, as being free Oth Linnen-drapers, and a man in office, Yet if my counsell, if you please to follow it, Doe not revenge you on these sawcy mad caps, May taking up of Holland at deare rates, Be quite abjur'd by courtiers: and I canvas'd Out of authority, how's that now? Clare. Master Busie, You seeme of sage discretion: and to say Truth, I conceive you have the stocke of wit Belonging to the city in your custody, You are the chamber of London, where that treasure Is hoarded up, and I doe hope you can Be true and secret. Busie. How's that Lady? I were unworthy else to thrive by linnen, Could I not keepe smocke secrets for your uncle, Your father mistris Grace, I care not for him, Although he be right worshipful and an Alderman, As I may say to you he has no more Wit then the rest oth' bench: what lies in's thumbe-ring, Yet I doe love you deerely for the kindnesse Shown to my girle here, and because you have Some flashes in your braines: and since you have Opend the case to me, ere we proceed To sentence, tell me seriously doe not you two Love Valentine, and Freewit? Grace. For my owne part, And I dare say as much too for my cosen. Their memories are as distant from our hearts, As civill honesty from theirs. Clare. And though I well could like that Freewit for a husband, Yet in mere spight because he shal not have me, Ile wed the next mans offered me. Busie. How's that? I would my wife were dead; two comely lasses, Such as sometimes I light on in my watch, would make fit wives for such rude sparks, and t'shal Goe hard but I will for your sakes sweete beauties, Number a brace of such sound cuttell to them, If you'l give way to it. Cla. And crowne thee for The king of witty Constables use our names, Or any thing to draw them forward, that Wee may in triumph laugh at their disgrace, And weel procure a pattent, to continue Thy office to thee, during life: and after To hire some ingenious poet that shall keepe Thy fame alive in a brave Epitaph Grav'd on thy marble. Enter Covet, Sir Geffrey Holdfast, Sir Timothy, young Holdfast. Geff. What varlet should that be trow? Cov. Truth I know not, Nor can conjecture, yet I did believe Him to be truely yours, because attird Ith' habit and the phrase of a right Scholler, And for your sonne, pardon me master Holdfast, I tooke you for some lewd audacious varlet, That had usurpt that title. Hold. I imagine It was some bastard of my fathers, gotten In youth upon his Taylors wife or Landresse, He has good store of them, but master Alderman You now conceive Ime son and heire apparent Unto the Holdfasts, whosoever got me, That's not much matter. Bus. How's that, anon before I set my watch, Ile visit you agen: meanetime, pray give my Daughter Luce leave to come home, her sister Poore wretched, is troubled with a paine ith' Bottome oth' body, pricks even to her very heart, And I would have Luce goe toth' Pothecaries, And get some Besar stone, they say 'twill cure her. Farewell good Ladies, you'l be sure to come Luce. Ex. Busie. Geff. Are these the maidens, I promise you master Alderman the'r virgins of good feature, and I shall Be well apaid if my sonne match to either, Which lik'st thou best boy? Hold. Both of them good father, Be not so troublesome, but let me take A view of them: Sir Timothy which doe you Like best of these two Ladies? Tim. Which doe you Like best good Mr. Holdfast. Hold. Yours shall be The choyce noble Sir Timothy. Tim. Yours indeed, Magnanimous Mr. Holdfast. Hold. On my gentility yours. Tim. Yours on my knighthood. Cov. Good sir Timothy, No striving, they are free for you, and for The staine those idle gallants put upon them, Twas on my credit gentlemen to keepe All other suitors off, in hope by that meanes To obtaine them for themselves. Tim. Tis very likely That Valentine's a wagge. Cov. Daughter and neice, This hopefull gentleman, and this good knight are By my care provided for your husbands, pray use Them as befits their worth, and take it As a fatherly admonition; either resolve To marry these or none. Cla. Tis a hard choyce sir, Yet rather then our maiden-heads shall starve, Weel feed on this course fare, young wenches uncle, Are like young hungry Hawkes: they'l stoope at Jack-daws, when they can meet with no better prey, Draw neerer thou doughty knight, and thou good Squire oth' damsells, Uncle these youthes are bashfull in the Presence of you two their grave Elders: your grim beards, And azure notes able are to fright Their precise love to silence. Tim. Shees ith' right, Ime such a fearefull foole I cannot speake, If any body looke on me. Geff. Let's withdraw, Now plye thy businesse boy. Clare. So now the game Exe. Sir Geffery and Covet. Will begin presently: I pray you tell me Which of you is the valiant Rosicleer, Dares breake his Launce on me. Tim. Marry that would I If I durst be so bold, mine is a stiffe one, And will pricke sorely. Clare. A fooles bable ist not? But come in briefe to th'purpose: is it you Sir knight of the ill favored face, That would have me for your Dulcina? Tim. Very right, You know my minde as well it seemes as if You'r in my belly. Grace. So then you are sped: This gentleman's my comely spouse that must be, Twere fitting Cosen Clare ert be a bargaine, They know on what conditions they doe cast Themselves away upon us. Hold. Twas discreetly Thought on, I would doe nothing rashly. Clare. Marke then You men that will transforme your selves to Monsters, wretches that will become so miserable, You'l hang your selves: &amp; think it a faire rid dance, Marke what youl come to, if you be so mad, So desperate mad to wed us, you must first, Resolve like patient gulls to have your noses Twingd if ours chance to itch: your eares like asses When they grow lasie cropt, least they oreheare Our chamber secrets, for our recreation, And least with too much ease we should grow resty, Weel beat you daily: while you like tame Spanells, Shall fawne and licke our shooe-strings. Grace. Nor expect, To get a good word from us in a twelve month, Hourely revilings and perpetuall noyses Shall be as favours taken that we would Vouchsafe to spend in such regardlesse trifles, Wee'l be as proud as ere our mothers were, When she was Lady Majoresse, and you humble, As her trim hench-boyes: whatsoever servants You kept before, although they were your grandsires, You shall turne off and limmit your attendants, As tis the city fashion to a woman Butler, that shall not dare without our license, To let you have a penny pot of sacke To give a frugall entertainment, to Your visiting friends. Clare. If you have a brother, Kinseman, or friend, that does in pitty grieve at The tyranny you live in, him it shall be felony To converse with, we in tissue and plush will Brave it while you walke in sustain, weel When we please have our faire coach and horses To carry us up to London to aske counsell of Our mothers and our gossips how to abuse you. You shall be still obedient, we commanding, And if a Lord or courtly gentleman, Whom we stile servant, out of love sometimes Gives us a visit, you shall not repine: If we forsake your bed to goe to his. Gra. And if you chance, as fooles will oft be Peeping to spye us coupling, with respective silence, You shall depart, not daring to bedew Your eyes with tears for grief that you are cuckolds, Nor to exalt your honors above your neighbours, But big with joy triumph that you have wives That are in so much credit, as to have Persons of quality, take the paines to get your Heires to your large revenewes. Tim. Very right, Tis not the fashion now adayes for knights To get their owne sons, tis sufficient for us If we can leave them lands, no matter who Was their true fathers. Cla. Say sir Timothy If upon these conditions you can like The match is perfect: but faith take my counsell, Make not your selves meere raskalls: the reproach To boyes and schollers, subjects fit for ballads, Not worthy MPs name to them, good Sir Timothy Have pitty on your selfe, and marry rather In your owne tribe, some damsell that can churne, Make Cheese and Apple pies with Currants in them, And Mr. Holdfast twere farre better for you to Match with some grave doctors impe at Cambridge Or else as twas your use when you'r a student, Lye with your bed maker. Tim. Very right, Yet I doe know all this is but in jest, To make us love you better. Hold. True sir Timothy; Speake as it were to let us understand By an Irony as we the learned call it, How well they meane to use us: therefore in My judgement it were requisit with all speed, While there in this good humour To strike the match up. Tim. Very right, we are No Jackdawes to be fright with these Scar-crowes, Mistris your hand, and if you'l have me so, If not so likewise: but you will repent it, You'l scarcely meet two that will offer fairer Then we have done. Cla. But doe you meane performance, Truely of these conditions. Hold. As sincerely As ere we meane to eate. Tim. Or drinke good Ale At mother Huffs a mornings. Grace. You'll confesse this Before the Priest and witnesses. Hold. Before The Congregation, or at a Commencement Before the University. Clar. That you'll be Honest contented Cuckolds, beare your heads As peaceably, and with as much obedience, As the tam'st beast ith' City. Tim. On my Knight-hood. Hold. On my gentility. Clar. Why then strike hands on't; Since you will needs undoe your selves, 'twere folly To indeavour to redeeme you: but this night We will be marry'd, and in private, Not yours nor our friends being acquainted with it. Weele meet you any where, procure the license, And weele be ready; so farewell: to night, Or not at all lets heare from you. Exeunt Clara, Grace. Hold. And feele us too ere morning, 'tshal goe hard else. Sir Timothy, was not this wisely carryed: To let them have their sayings? but we will not Be such starke fooles to doe what we have promis'd; When they're ours once, we may rule them easily At our owne pleasures. Tim. Very right; and use them At our owne pleasures: But see here's your Mr. And Mr. Constable your Landlord. Enter Grimes, Busie. Hold. Landlord, welcome On my Gentility, to my house that must be. Thou thoughtst, because I did weare Lokram shirts Ide no wit: but harke thee, I have got The wench of Gold: Sir Timothy, and I Have strucke the stroake old boy: to night's the night, Thou shalt know more of it ere twelve of Clocke, And then believe me: Grimes goe you to th'office; There's mony, fetch a Licence. Tim. There's more money, Bring me a Licence too; sure as we woo'd Weele wed together. Busie. How's this? Gentlemen I shall have gloves I hope. Hold. And favours too, Thy daughter Nell shall have my Bride garters, And thy fore-man my poynts: But honest Landlord, I know th'art excellent at a device, This matter must be private, not my father, Nor Mr. Alderman must be acquainted, Till all is finished: Could thy wit but helpe us To plot this finely: Clare and Grace will meet us, At any place where weele appoynt. Bus. How's that? Ile set you presently ith' way; my house Shall be your randevous; soone after ten. The houre of meeting: there Ile have prepar'd For the two Ladyes a Sedan: that shall Carry them thence unseene through the watch At Ludgate, where I exercise my office, Into white-Friers, there shall a little Levite Meet you, and give you to the lawfull bed. With much celerity: give me your mony, &amp; ile take out the licence. How's that now? Tim. Very right. Bus. Meane time my daughter Luce shall give them notice How all's contriv'd, they'll be willing, When they shall know the managing's committed To my discretion; but about your businesse; It will grow late oth' suddaine. Hold. Come Sir Timothy. Ex. Hold. Tim. Grimes. Bus. So, so, as I would have it: if I doe not Doe something to exalt the fame of Constables, May I be hang'd upon my staffe of Office. Ha! Valentine and Freewit with my daughter? They must not see me. Exit. Enter Valentine, Free-wit, Luce. Luce. Tis certaine Mr. Freewit they are contracted, And this night to be marryed: I am sorry You should be thus supplanted, by two such Dull witlesse ideots: but they are so bent on't, That when I speake in your behalfes, my Mistris Ent. Clar. Grace. Stopt my mouth with a blow oth' lips: see here They are themselves; if you doe any good, It must be now or never. Ex. Luce. Clar., Grace. Ha, ha, ha. Free. What doe the Monkyes laugh at? Clar. To behold Two such trim gallants as your selves, like Asses, Shaking your empty Noddles ore the Oates You faine would eate, but must not lick your lips at. You thought to have wonne us by your wit, where lyes it? In your gay cloaths; perhaps so, if you can Out-sweare the faithfull Tayler, that's unpaid yet. Or cheat your Sempstresse. Troth make safe retreat Into the Suburbs, there you may finde cast wenches, Who will in pitty have you: and for dowry, Bring you an ampler stocke of hot diseases, Than you are already furnish'd with. We Orphans Oth' City have more charity to our selves, Than to wed Surgeons boxes. Grace. When our portions Shall be consum'd in Pothecaries Bills, Or giving Doctors fees; or at best use, Serve but to purchase Sacke; or be as tribute Paid toth' three Kings; or piously bestowed Upon Jerusalem. Free. No, you'd best reserve them, Till those you wed be beg'd for fooles; and then They will be seas'd to better use. You think now You have broake our gulls with anger that you have Resolv'd on other husbands: who would have you? But two such ideots, fit to be the styles To the vast pride and lust lurkes in your blood, Derivative from the City: for our selves, Why should you have a thought we could descend So much from gentries honour, to mixe with you? Tis true, you appeare handsome, but you paint Worse then a Bawd, or waiting-woman, in love With the spruce Chaplaine. Val. For your haire let's see Your eye-browes badge: oh tis not your owne; Be modest and confesse it: tis a Peruke, I saw it at the French-mans in the Strand, The other day: and though you hold your head up, It is suppos'd it growes too neare your shoulders, And you weare iron bodyes, to keep downe And rectifie the crooked paths that are In this same hill your body. Free. Nay, besides Y'are infinitely lascivious, tis reported Y'ave kild the reverend Alderman at least, Ten Prentises, besides foure journy-men. With too much labour: That you will be drunke Our selves can testifie: and with these imperfections This inexhausted Magazin of vices, Could you imagine we would have you? no. Heaven give you joy, with your well-chosen spouses: May they be patient Cuckolds, that's all the harme Weele wish them: the more fooles, more fit for husbands To such hot wild cats. Clare. Well Mr. Free-wit, I thought how ever we, in mirth, or madnesse, Could have transgrest civility, that you Would not have made such a severe construction Of our intentions: how i've lov'd you, heavens Can beare me righteous witnesse; but mans faith weeps. Is fickle as his shadow, never seene, But when the Sunne shines. Grace. And that you, whom I Even at the first view lov'd, and fixt my heart on: Should not alone contemne me, but with these Abuses wound my fame, torments my soule Beyond the strength of patience, heaven forgive you. Free. They are our owne, deare Valentine: our owne as surely, As if the officious Priest had put the Ring Upon their pretty fingers; why you need not Take words with such unkindnesse Clare yourselves Being the occasion. Clar. Such discourtesies From friends; nay, such beloved friends as you were, Wounds deeply Mr. Freewit. Free. Prethee Clara No more remonstrances of this unkindnesse, Drye thy faire eyes, or I shall else grow childish, And weep for company: poore heart i'me sorry Th'art thus distemper'd; prethee sweet forgive me; We will be friends, and instantly steale hence, And end all difference in a happy marriage. Clar. Ha, ha, ha: hold the mans head, heel swowne I feare oth' suddaine: marry you; goe boast How you've abus'd us, and doe not forget This part oth' story, twill much grace the action, That you were foold agen into beliefe That we could love you: ha, ha, ha. Ex. Clare, Grace. Val. We have made ourselves fine fooles, a poxe upon them: I knew their teares could not be serious: They onely fell from their left eye, as wealthy Young widowes weep for their old husbands. Freewit They're lost, past all recovery. Free. Who can helpe it; There are more wives ith' Kingdome; yet Ime vext That two such gulls should carry them: lets goe seeke Sir Timothy and my Cozen Holdfast out, And geld them, then proclaime them to be Eunuchs. That course may spoile their marriage. Enter Busie. Bus. I have o're-heard them all, and it conduces Much to my purpose: now, or never Busie Shew thy selfe a true sparke, that Constables Hereafter may be thought to have some wit, More than is in their staffe. Good day to you gallants, I have some businesse with you. Val. Your name is Busie? Bus. The same body. Your friend, although a Constable; there were two Ladyes Went lately from you. Free. What of that? Bus. They told me, as I am of their councell, that they lov'd you. And though some words of course had past between you, As oft does among friends: you know the Proverbe put lately In a Ballad, where I learnd it, that amantium irÃ¦ amoris redinte- gratio est: yet that was but in jest, and in all haste, Wished me to assure you, that if you would speedily Take out the Licences this very night, twixt nine and ten, at my House they would meet you, and joyne with you in Matrimony. Free. Is this truth? Bus. How's that? upon the faith sir of a man in office, You may believe me: for a Priest, leave that To my care gentlemen, ile have one ready Privately in White-Friers, the house anon I will enforme you, and what way to take To misse pursuit, if any should endeavour Your apprehension. Val. How may we deserve this kindness from you? Bus. When tis done, then thanke me; meane time make haste, and get the licences. Ex. Free. Val. I will pursue the rest, and if I fit not some body, Ent. Luce. Let me be held as other of my fellowes are, Asses in office. Luce thou art come as aptly as I could wish: be sure at nine of Clock to be at home, and if you can bring with you two of the gentlewomens gownes, question not why? But on my blessing doe it; if this hit, Time shall report some Constables have wit. Ex. Explicit Actus Quartus.</field>

Men. Yet they doe't Without the City, I have heard a brewer, Being one yeare in office, got as much from those Good soules as bought him a new mash-fat, And mended all his coolers. Bus. How's that? we are bidden Not to take ill examples, for your selves you have Free leave for th'good oth' common wealth to Sleepe after eleven: meane time you may play at Tray trip, or cockall for blacke puddings, So now your charge is finish'd.

Set downe your trusty Bills my sparkes, and let us Watch ore a cup of Sacke, here tis will make you Each one an Alderman: a bigger glasse boy, I doe not love these thimbles, they are fit For none but precise Taylors, that doe sip, In zeale, and sweare cuds nigs over their wine, To cheat their customers: so this is something. A score or two of these my sparkes, will set Our braines a floate, and then weel talke as wisely, As all the common Counsell, how's that now? Men. Mr. Constable Y'are in the right I promise you: I feele My selfe already growing from a watchman Into a head-borow. Bus. How's that? thou shalt be A Constable within this halfe houre Mendwell, Carry thy staffe with the red Crosse and Dagger In as much state, as the best gold smith, That ere bore office in Cheap-side; here's to thee, Hang care and Cosenage; let mercers use it In the darke shops: I am a Linnen Draper, Love wit and Sacke, and am resolv'd to thrive by't, When they shall break like bottles: Here lets canvas This quart, and then will bumbaste off another, And drinke a health to Holland, and the mad boyes That traile the puissant Pike there: how's that; doe you peepe? Enter Fidlers Boy. Boy. Please you hear a good song Gentlemen? Bus. These squeakers, doe claime more Priviledge in a Taverne, Then a man in office; into every roome They thrust their frisled heads; and Ide bin at it With some distressed Damsell, that I had taken Late in my watch, thus Ide bin serv'd: ile have An Edict made against them at Guild Hall, Next sitting certainely. Boy. A very new song and please your worships gentlemen. Bus. There you lye boy; I doubt it is some lamentable stuffe, Oth' Swine-fac'd gentlewoman, and that youle grunt out Worse than a parish Boare when he makes love Unto the Vicars sow; her story's stale boy, 'T has beene already in two playes. Boy. An't please your worships, My song is of a Constable. Bus. How's that? a Constable, Tis not my selfe: I hope ime not exalted Into a ballad: Dare you sirrah abuse Officers in your Madrigalls; you deserve, And so does he that made it, to be whipt for't. Boy. Pray heare it sir: tis no such matter on my credit. Bus. How's that? Well, on thy credit I will heare it. Callin your company; welcome my Masters: Ent. Musicians. Here: wet your wesands first, then thunder forth Some lofty Sonnets in the praise of Constables; And never feare the whipping-post hereafter. Constables 2 Song. Sing and rejoyce, the day is gone. And the wholsome night appeares. Jn which the Constable on Throne Of trusty bench, does with his Peeres The comely watch; men sound of health, Sleep for the good oth' Common-wealth. Tis his office to doe so, Being bound to keep the peace. And in quiet sleep all know Mortall jarres, and lewd brawles cease: A Constable may then for's health, Sleep for the good oth' Common-wealth. Unlesse with Nobler thoughts inspir'd, To the Taverne here sort, Where with Sacke his Sences fir'd, He raignes as fairy King in Court; Drinking many a lusty health, Then sleepes for th'good oth' Common-wealth. With a comely girle, whom late He had taken in his watch, Oft he steales out of the gate Her at the old sport to match, Though it may impaire his health, He sleeps with her for th'good oth' Common-wealth. Who then can Constables deny To be persons brave and witty, Since they onely are the eye, The Glory, the delight oth' City, That with staffe, and Lanthorne light Are like blacke Pluto Princes of the night. Men. An excellent Ditty I promise you. Busie. Well done boy. There's twelve pence for you Knaves, and tell the Poet That made it, if heele come to me, ile give him A quart of Sacke to whet his Muse.

Lay hands I charge you, beare him hence, Ile have you all laid fast else. Bus. How's that? I hope youle let us Drinke off our sacke first: twere farre better sir, In my poore judgment, that you sate down in peace, As does befit your gravity, and drinke A friendly cup or two: then for the first Offence to send your neighbour to the Counter: Pray sir be not so fierce; a glasse, or two Will mollifie your hard heart. Cov. Will you not stirre knaves? Where is the Master of the house? ile make This Busie an example. Bus. Pray doe not sir: Perhaps y'are bashfull sir, and will not drinke, Cause you want coyne to pay: ile lend you some; Or if you scorne to borrow, you may dip Your chaine; a good pawne never shames the master.

Seise on the Alderman and Sir Geffery. Men. Come, come, come along sir. Cov. Dare you doe this sirrah? Bus. Yes, and answer't too sir.

Cov. Sirrah, sirrah, ile make you smoak for this. Mend. Come, we lose time sir. Bus. Let him have A good fire pray you. So, all works as't had bin Molded afore in waxe: boy there's your reckoning.
