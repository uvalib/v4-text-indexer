      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âWalter's Cottage, surrounded by a neat Shrubbery, L.; a table and seats at the door, with fruits and other refreshments prepared for the wedding guests. âView of Lord Raymond's Castle, and surrounding Country, in the backgroundâLittle Robinette discovered arranging the collation at the table. Enter Walter from the cottage, L. Wal. (L.) Come, bustle, bustle, my dear. Our guests will shortly be here to the wedding. [Regarding the table.] That's right, you young rogue; I declare you're a very handy little servant, and so you had need be; for you mustn't expect any assistance from your sister Jane. Girls, on their wedding-day, have too much else to think of, to attend to company. Rob. (R.) Oh, father, I'd give the world if I were but big enough to be marriedâI'm so fond of fine clothes and sweetmeats. [Retires up to the table. Wal. Psha! you little simpleton. When the time comes, you'll find that there are bitters as well as sweets in matrimony; though, for my part, I had no reason to complain; for my poor wife, Margery, who is now gone to her long homeâHeaven's peace be with her! was one of the best creatures that ever lived. Well, well, she's better off now, that's one comfort. But what's this? [Wipes a tear from his eye.] I'll not grieveâno, I'm determined I'll not be sorrowful on my dear daughter's wedding-day. [To Robinette.] But say, my little darling, where is Henry? Rob. [Coming forward, R.] Gone to tell the parson to get ready to marry him; and how he did skip along, to be sure! I always thought Billy, our goat, could jump better than anybody else, but he's no match for Henry, after all. Yet who knows how Master Billy would skip and jump if it was his wedding-day? Wal. Ha! ha! ha!âYou little rogue!âCome and give your old father a kiss. Enter Jane from the cottage, dressed as a bride. Jane. (C.) Good morrow to my dear father, and my little darling, Robinette. [Kisses her sister, who retires up to look out for Henry. Wal. (L.) Heaven bless thee, my child, on this eventful morning of thy life! 'Tis an important step thou art about to take. Jane. But one which I feel confident I never shall have reason to repent of. Wal. With Heaven's blessing! I know that both prudence and inclination dictate thy choice; Henry is a worthy youth, and with him thou wilt be happy. Jane. If bounteous Heaven smiles on innocence,â If duty to our parents can call down The blessings of that God, who did command Children to honour those who gave them being,â I trust your Jane has herein done her duty. Wal. Thou art, indeed, my own, my dearest Jane! Make but thy husband happy as thy father, And he will never rue the day that bound him In wedlock's chains: he'll find them cords of love, Not fetters of restraint. Jane. Fear not, my father. Love shall weave his chains Of softest silk; he shall not feel their weight. Wal. Now, my dear girl, take from thy aged father The wholesome lessons of experience. Thy future husband is thy lover now: Be it thy care to keep him still the same When he's thy husband. Be a thrifty wife; Make his home comfortable; let him find, When he returns from labour faint and weary, A hearty welcome, and a smiling face. If cares have ruffled him, do thou with love,â Not curiosity to know the cause,â Chase trouble from him, like a misty cloud Before the radiant sun. Ever through life Mark well my words, and take thy father's counsel As a rich dowry. Jane. Deep in this heart your counsel is engrav'd, And I will guard it as a sacred treasure. Yet, should I need a model in my state Of happy wedlock, where could one be found More perfect than the parents whom I honour'd? I need but love my husband as my mother Lov'd you; and he must be a wretch indeed Who could requite such love with aught but love. Rob. [Runs forward, clapping her hands.] Father, here's Henry coming!âHe's coming! he's coming! Enter Henry, dressed as a bridegroom, R. U. E. Hen. (L. C.) [Embracing Jane.] All is in readiness, my dearest Jane; Our friends assembled, and the priest prepar'd To call down Heaven's blessing on our loves. Jane. (R.) Why tarry, then, so long, my dearest Henry? Hen. I had return'd before, but on my way I chanc'd to meet an ancient wither'd woman: The path was narrow, and, as I tripp'd along, Light as young Cupid on the wings of love, I struck against the dame, and was the cause That she did kiss the earth against her will. Joy and high expectation spurr'd me on, While charity commanded me to stay, And help the poor old creature up again. Returning, I obey'd, and found the beldam Grinning with spite, and muttering maledictions. âYour pardon, dame,â quoth I. âPeace, lout!â she cried; âI know thee wellâthis is thy wedding-day; But may it prove to thee a time of sorrow! May jealousy torment thee day and night! May thy wife prove a shrewâa thriftless wanton! Thy children beg of callous hearts their bread From door to door!âAnd may thy ev'ry joy Be blasted ere it reach maturity!â Thus the hag mutter'd, While her malicious palsied head kept time To the terrific music of her tongue. Her maledictions struck my soul with horror,â My ear revolted at her hellish prayer! And, ere the foul fiend seal'd it with her Amen, I fled from curses to these loving arms, Where blessingsâheavenly blessings, are my lot! [Embraces Jane. Jane. Heed not the powers of darkness, dearest Henry: 'Twere ill with virtue, if her Friend above Were not more mighty than her enemies. Wal. (L.) Heaven bless you both, my children! Ha! those sounds [Rustic music heard without. Proclaim the coming of our worthy neighbours To greet the happy pair, and share our joy. Enter Villagers, dancing to pipes and tabors, led on by young Edwin and Amy, L. U. E. Wal. (R.) Welcome, kind neighbours, all. This is the happiest day of my life! [Going to meet the Villagers. Edw. (L. C.) What, happier than your own wedding-day, father Walter? Wal. No, I do not exactly mean that; butâno matter. So you are going to be married, too, Master Edwin? Well, I wish you joy with all my heart;âthe more weddings the better. Amy. (L.) [Courtesying.] Yes, neighbour Walter; my dear Edwin is going to be married to me, and I to him, if you've no objection. Edw. Yes, we're both going to be married together, if you've no objection. Wal. None in the world. [Drinks.] And here's success to you, and all of us. Come, Henry and Jane, my dears, don't let our worthy guests want for refreshments; hand round the nutbrown ale. Rob. (R. C.) Yes, and I'll wait upon the company, too, father; because I shall want waiting upon myself one of these days, when I get married. Wal. You get married, indeed, you little gipsy!â But, Jane, my love, have you seen Lord Raymond lately? Jane. (C.) Not since the day on which you sent me with a letter to the castle. Hen. (R. C.) Go not again. Lord Raymond is a man Whom, of all others, ev'ry honest female Should shun. He is a lawless libertine. Wal. Hush, thoughtless youth, and teach thy tongue discretion! Enter Buckram, the village Tailor, in a holyday suit, L. S. E. Buc. (C.) Ah, my honest friend, Walter, how dost do? Most obedient, neighbours all. Much joy to the happy couple. Henry, my boy, how d'ye like your wedding clothes? [Turns him round and round.] There's a suit for you!âa dress fit for a lord! Pearl buttonsâplush liningâevery stitch sewed with silk, by your most obedient very humble servant, Billy Buckram, professor of the noble art of cutting up and contriving, at your service. Hem! Apropos, have you heard the news? [Henry, Jane, and Guests, retire to take refreshments. Wal. [Aside.] Mercy on us, what a tongue! Buc. Most wonderful news. Do you know they talk of a war betweenâ[Crosses to R.]âYour coat, waistcoat, and small-clothes, do set remarkably well, neighbour Walter,âanother proof of my genius! Apropos, of course you know what an accident has befallen old Justice Stubblefield? Wal. I think you'd better partake of our hospitality than waste the precious time in gossipping. Come, what say you to a cup of ale?âChoice home-brewed beverage? Buc. With all my heart; and, while we quaff the enlivening potion, I'll tell you all the news. [They retire to the table. Hen. [Coming forward.] At length the happy hour is arriv'd,â That blissful hour, which in anticipation So often prov'd the solace of my soul, In times of gloom and sadness! [Glancing at Jane. How beautifulâhow heavenly she looks! Her eyes do seem to beam ethereal mildness, Transporting my fond soul, as in a trance, To realms of bliss too rich for mortal man! To call an angel mineâfor ever mine! Oh, Henry!âhappy Henry! What is an emperor's bliss compar'd with thine? Enter Old Francis, R. U. E. Fra. (R.) God save ye, my worthy neighbours all!â Ah, is that you, young Master Henry? So, I see you are all merry-making here, and in your best holyday suits. I say, friend Walter, I've something from Lord Raymond for your private ear. We must be left alone. Wal. (C.) Welcome, my honest Francis! Henry, and my friends, retire a moment. Hen. (L. C.) You'll not be long. Perhaps you know not, Francis, This day will be recorded in my memory To the last hour of life's eventful scene, As that on which I sipp'd the sweetest honey Which ever hung upon a woman's lips. It is my wedding-day. Fra. Is it possible? Ah, you cunning rogue! your's is the time of life for weddings. I wish you joy with all my heart! [Aside.] I thought 'twas rather mysterious, and I'm glad I've got at the bottom of it. Jane. (L.) Dear father, waste not in business those precious moments which love claims as its due. [Exit with Henry and Guests into the cottage. Buc. (L.) [To Old Francis.] Apropos, Master Francis, I think 'tis almost time you had new liveries at the castle; this you've got on begins to look rather threadbare. Fra. We wish to be alone, good neighbour Buckram. Buc. Oh, by all means; but, whenever you've need of my services, you have only to command me. Any and every thing, from a court-dress to a smock-frock, is perfectly in my way. Pearl buttonsâplush liningâ every stitch sewed with silk, by your most obedient very humble servant, Billy Buckram. [Exit into the cottage, bowing. Wal. (L. C.) That fellow's tongue is a match for all the old gossips in the village. But what says Lord Raymond? Fra. (R. C.) He greets you, and expects you at the castle on business of importance. Wal. I pray you, Francis, excuse me to his lordship. Fra. Impossible; you know his lordship's violent temper well. Moreover, recollect you are considerably in arrears for rent, and therefore in his power; so do not delay to obey his lordship's summons on the instant. 'Tis a very mysterious affair altogether, if one could but get at the bottom of it. Wal. I am his lordship's debtor, it is true; and therefore must obey this most unwelcome summons. Fra. On the instant, d'ye hear? [Going, but returning.] AndâWhat an old headpiece I have got! I had well nigh forgotten the main pointâthe very quintescence of my errand. Your fair daughter Jane, she is to accompany you. I will report your coming to his lordship, [Aside] and then I'll hide me in the closet, and listen to their discourse; no doubt I shall very soon get at the bottom of it. [Exit, R. U. E. Wal. My Jane go with me!âThis is very strange. Lord Raymond is so fond of love intrigues,â I feel alarm'dâyet shall I not be with her? And who dares offer insult to my darling? [The village clock strikes twelve. Enter Jane, Henry, Edwin, Amy, and the Guests, except Buckram, from the cottage. Hen. (L. C.) There, said I not so? 'Tis past twelve o'clock, nor can we now be married till to-morrow. Jane. (L. C.) This is, indeed, unkind of you, my father. Edw. (L.) Ay, and see what we've got by waiting for you; I'm disappointed as well. Amy. (C.) Yes, and I too. Oh, I shall cry my eyes out! Edw. No don't, lovey; they are far too pretty for that. Wal. (R.) The fault's not mine, my friends. Lord Raymond has commanded Jane instantly to repair to his castle. Hen. What! my dear Jane, alone and unprotected? Wal. No, my dear boy; her father goes with her. Hen. Ay, and I too, by Heaven! You might as well send a poor innocent lamb Into the den of a gaunt hungry wolf, As a young female, lovely and alone, To this Lord Raymond's castle. Wal. Fear not, my boy; we'll stand or fall together. Jane. Come, my dear Henry. What need we fear? Lord Raymond is a great and powerful man; Yet, should he offer violence, he'll find That England's laws are mightier far than he. [Exeunt, R. U. E. SCENE II. âGothic Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle, with window, L.âChairs brought on. Enter Lord Raymond, followed by a Servant, R. D. Lord R. (L.) You say old Francis is not yet returned. Ser. (R.) Not yet, my lord. Lord R. When he arrives, fail not to send him hither. [Servant bows, and exit, L. D. Rich, noble, powerful, who would refuse Alliance with Lord Raymond? My father's death hath freed me from restraint, And I no longer, like a truant boy, Need fear the rod of discipline. I now Will taste the joys of sensuality: The richest luxuries the earth can yield, The fairest flowers from beauty's lovely garden,â The most mellifluent strains of harmony, Shall court my ev'ry sense with new delights. I'll quaff the cup of pleasure to the dregs; Live, like the flutt'ring insect of a day, Basking in sunshine, reckless of the future, And die in ecstacy! [Starts.] NoâdieâI cannot! That single word freezes my ardent blood! What means this palpitation of the heart,â This ague-fit that seizes on my limbs? It is that bugbear, Conscience. Hence, intruder! Go, lecture beardless boys and toothless dotards! Lord Raymond is a manâhe heeds thee not. Enter Lady Jane Raymond, R. S. E. Lady J. (R.) Good-morrow, my dear brother. Lord R. (L.) Kind thanks, dear Jane; you rose betimes to-day. Lady J. The morning was so lovely, that to waste it In the dull arms of sleep would have been folly. Besides, to speak the truth, there is a something, Which, like a load of lead, weighs down my spirits, And kills my peace of mind. [Sighs. Lord R. The cause, dear Jane; no secrets from your brother. Lady J. Reserve were wrong, where confidence is due; And therefore will I, to a loving brother, Relate the simple story of my grief. 'Twas but last evening, as I wander'd forth To view the glories of the setting sun, Just as I reach'd the borders of the forest, Two black, determin'd, savage-looking men, With threat'ning gestures and uplifted daggers, Appear'd before me. âHold!â in a thund'ring voice, one of them cried, While his companion seiz'd me in his arms. I scream'd aloudâresistance was in vain. Attracted by my cries, swift as an arrow My guardian angel came,âa comely youth, Who, with the fury of an angry lion, Rush'd on the villains. One he straight disarm'd, And with his weapon slew the other ruffian, Who dared insult an unprotected woman. Lord R. He must have been a brave and hardy youth. Lady J. Ay, and as lovely, too, as he was brave. Oh, my dear brother, spite of shame, I own That he who sav'd my honour won my heart. Lord R. Be cautious, Jane. Yet say, who was the youth? Lady J. Alas! I know not. As soon as he beheld Me safe, he fled, light as the sportive fawn, Across the plain, and scarcely took my thanks. Lord R. A strange adventure, this. Lady J. Could I but once again behold the youth, And prove my gratitude by deeds, not words, I should be happy! [Crosses to the window, L. What do I see? 'Tis he!â My brave deliverer coming up the lawn! A maiden, too, link'd with him arm-in-arm. I hope she is his sister: no, she's not! That look was far too tenderâsisters gaze not thus. Now they advanceâhe fondly grasps her hand, And, as they, light as fairies, trip along, She reads heaven's language in his lovely eyes, And hears its music flowing from his tongue. Oh, happy maid! how do I envy thee! [Sinks on a chair. Lord R. Romantic nonsense! [Crossing to the window.] Why, 'tis young Henry. Sister, arise, and be not folly's dupe. You would not surely throw away your hand Upon a peasant boy? [He raises her from the chair. Lady J. Forgive me, my dear brother; I feel my error, and will strive to conquer This ill-judg'd passion. Yet, should the struggle break this loving heart, I claim a brother's pity! [Exit, R. Lord R. I cannot pity thee, for pity is A stranger to my nature. If, good sister, Thou needs wilt play the fool, do soâI care not; It concerns not me. Enter Old Francis, L. D. Fra. My lord, your tenant Walter is without. Lord R. (R.) And his fair daughter, Jane, is she with him? Fra. She is, my lord. I found them all merry-making and right jovially inclinedâgoing to get married, forsooth, in full gallop, as one might say. It seemed rather mysterious, but I very soon got at the bottom of it. Lord R. Send Walter hither. Fra. I will, my gracious lord. [Aside.] And then for my hiding-place in the closet; for I'm determined to get at the bottom of it. [Exit, L. D. Lord R. Why blame my sister? Do I act more wisely? What is this girl who hath bewitch'd my senses? A peasant's childâno more. But what of that? We men may have our follies and amours, And go unpunish'd by the partial world; But woman's steps are watch'd with Argus' eyes, And, if she act imprudently but once, She forfeits honour, and is lost for ever. Enter Walter, L. D. Wal. (L.) Obedient to your summons I am come, To learn your lordship's pleasure. Lord R. (R.) You are aware, no doubt, that there's a debt Of some five hundred crowns between us, Walter? Wal. There is, my lord. Lord R. Are you prepar'd to pay it? Wal. Not at present. Lord R. I'm sorry for it; for I hold it wrong That those who are in debt should feast and riot At other people's charge. Wal. My lord, we are not given to excess. This is a joyful day, and Iâ Lord R. I understandâsome holyday, perhaps. You have a daughter. Wal. I have, indeed, my lord; a dear good child. Lord R. Ay, and as beautiful as she is good. I've news for theeâsuch news, my honest graybeard, As will delight the dull cold ear of age, And make thy oozing wimpering eyes once more Sparkle with youthful lustre. Know, then, since By my late father's death, as well as birthright, Being now possess'd of power and wealth, I mean To do you honour, and take your daughter Jane Under my kind protection. Wal. My lord, my daughter Jane needs no protection While her old father lives, and England's laws Remain the poor man's shield against oppression. Lord R. Old man, you do not seem to understand me. I love your daughter Jane, and feel inclin'dâ Wal. To marry her, my lord? Lord R. [Smiling.] No, not exactly that. Wal. [Going abruptly.] Good day, my lord. Lord R. [Stamping violently.] Stay, dotard!âI command thee, On pain of ling'ring till thou rott'st in gaol! Yet I'll dissemble with the drivelling fool, [Aside. And if, by a mock marriage, I can gain My ends, and lull his scruples, 'twere as well. Suppose I were inclin'd to wed your Jane. [To Walter. Wal. My Jane, my lord!âWhat, a poor peasant girl! Lord R. Her beauty is her dowry. If I chuse To make the girl my wife, who shall gainsay me? Wal. No one, most surely. Yetâyou'll pardon me, My Jane is promis'd, and her banns proclaim'd. Lord R. Psha! driveller! Is she promis'd to a lord? Hast thou no feeling of ambition in thee? Does not the name of honour warm thy heart? Wal. Not the mere name of honour, my lord, but the thing itself; and if your lordship means, by an honourable heart, an honest one, dam'me but I'd show hearts with the proudest nobleman in the kingdom! Lord R. Thou art a strange old-fashion'd simpleton, And blind to thine own interest. Where's your daughter? Think you her love will stand the test of gold? Go send her hitherâyou have naught to fear: I fain would try if I, by a fair offer, Can win the maiden's heart. Wal. My lord, I do obey. Confiding in your honour, I'll send my darling hither, that she may be in all things free to act. [Asideâgoing.] I know my child too wellâ her love is trueâgold will not dazzle her. [Exit, L. D. Lord R. 'Twere scarcely worth the trouble; had not nature, In a plebeian mood, to vex the rich, Sent this poor peasant girl into the world, Deck'd out with all the mastery of her art, Lavishing on her such a world of charms, That men, in gazing on perfection's model, Forget themselves. It is not love that prompts,â Her beauty dazzles me; and I will have her, E'en at the hazard of my soul. She comes. Enter Jane, L. D. Jane. (L.) [Timidly.] What is your lordship's pleasure? Lord R. (R.) To see thee, Jane, and live but in thy smiles. Jane. [Embarrassed.] My lord! Lord R. Nay, be not coy; throw off this cold reserve, And let those eyes smile on me. It is true, I have been wont to stray from flow'r to flow'r, Inconstant as the gaudy butterfly, But thou hast fix'd my heart to one dear object,â It is thyself. I mean to wed thee, Jane: What say you? Wilt thou have me for a husband? Jane. My lord, I cannot think you serious; And yet to jest, where jesting wounds the heart, Is cruel. Lord R. I have been told a love-tale touching you; Such a romantic ditty as we read of In books, the offspring of some madman's brain. Thus ran the storyâlisten, pretty Jane: Being poor yourself, you needs must fall in love With a poor youth, comely and brave, no doubt; And then you wander through the silent grove, [Takes her arm. Thus arm-in-arm, sighing your souls away; Or sit by moonlight in some fragrant bower, While the melodious nightingale pours forth Her dulcet harmony. All this, of course; 'Twere not romantic else. Now I deal not in fancy's flimsy wares,â Reality for me. I offer you, For shadow, substance: what is your reply? Jane. My lord, I pray you, seek not to destroy That humble bliss which is my happy lot, Yet makes me richer than the proudest monarch. Lord R. I'll hold the balance of thy future fortune Up to thy view. In one scale will I weigh My own pretensions, whilst thou, in the other, Mayst throw the merits of this poor peasant, Henry, Whom thou so dearly lov'st. Now to begin. Lord Raymond is a rich and powerful nobleman. [Pointedly. Jane. [Quickly responding.] Henry, a happy and contented peasant. Lord R. I keep a stately chariot, to convey me From place to place. Jane. Henry has youth and strength to carry him Where'er he wants to go. Lord R. I possess gold. Jane. And Henry, honesty! [Crosses to R. Lord R. Psha! That's worse than nothing, as the world goes now. Do you refuse my offer? Jane. Nay, good my lord, that were too harsh a term: I do decline the honour you intend me. Lord R. [Aside.] Perdition on this Henry! [Crosses to R.] He hath gain'd Possession of the loveliest heart on earth! But I will trample on my peasant rival, And crush the worm to atoms! Yet shall dissimulation be my mantle, Until my schemes are ripe. [To Jane.] I do admire, Fair maid, the constancy of thy attachment, And rest thy friend, though not thy loving husband. Jane. My lord, your kindness overpowers me. [Aside, and going.] Thank heaven, the trial's pass'd, and love has triumph'd! [Exit, L. D. Lord R. Prefer a paltry peasant to Lord Raymond! This insult calls for deadly, black revenge! Spirit of darkness, I invoke thy aid! And, if there be within thy fiery realm One demon more malicious than the rest, Send him to take possession of this heart! Let Nero be to me in cruelty A very babe!âLet me not shrink to see The blood of innocence this hand may shed; And let the cries of widows and of orphans Be in mine ears the most melodious music! Success!âMy prayer is heard! [Laying his hand on his heart. The demon I invok'd is here already! Enter Old Francis, with a letter, L. D. Fra. (L.) An't please your lordshipâ[Aside.]âMercy on us! how ghastly he looks!â'Tis vastly strange!âI should like to get at the bottom of it! Lord R. (R.) [Not noticing Old Francis.] Yes! yes!â I feel it plainly: the devil's here! Fra. [Falling on his knees, and clasping his hands.] Mercy on us!âThe devil here!âWhereâwhere, my l-o-r-d? Lord R. Peace, simpleton! What hast thou in thy hand? Fra. Not the de-v-il, my lord, but a letter. [Rises, and gives the letter. Lord R. [Reads.] âMy Lord,âYou are hereby directed, as Lord Lieutenant of the county of Westmoreland, to call out the armed yeomanry, and instantly march to attack the rebels, who have crossed the borders.âHarcourt, Secretary of State.â 'Tis well. This letter comes most opportunely: This privilege to murder is most kind; For scenes of blood are suited to my mind. [Exit, R. D. Fra. Mysteriousâvastly mysterious! What could his lordship mean by saying, just as I entered the room, the devil's here? Mercy on us! it makes me tremble all over! [Looking fearfully around.] I don't see him any where, and heaven forbid I should! I trust the saints will defend us, and keep the devil at home. [Pointing below.] Ah, that's a place I don't wish to get at the bottom of. [Exit, L. Enter Henry hastily, L. S. E., in search of Jane. Hen. Janeâmy dear Jane!âwhere art thou? Enter Lady Jane, in equal haste, R. S. E., meeting Henry. Lady J. (R.) I am here. [Recollects herself, and endeavours to conceal her confusion. Hen. (L.) [Bowing respectfully.] My lady, pardon this intrusion. Iâ The lady whom I rescued from the robbers! [Aside. Lady J. Young man, I'm under obligations to you, Which are a burden I would fain discharge. Hen. Lady, you owe me nothing: what I did Was but my dutyâthere's no merit in it. That man must be a wretch, unfit to live, Or bear the human form, who would not gladly Hazard e'en life itself to save from insult An unprotected woman. Lady J. Generous youth! Is, then, my debt discharg'd? I would that all who languish now in prison, The victims of misfortune or oppression, Had creditors as merciful. Hen. Good my lady, Your approbation is the sole reward I crave; and so most humbly take my leave. [Going. Lady J. One word yet, gen'rous youth, before we part. The maiden who accompanied you hither,â She is your sister, is she not? Hen. Not so, my lady. She isâ Lady J. A cousin, then, perhaps, orâ Hen. Oh, no, my lady; she is my own dear Jane! I would not for the world she were my sister, Or anything but what she soon will be,â My loving wife! Oh, happyâhappy thought! [Lady JanÃ© reclines on a chair. My lady, why this tremor? Are you ill? Shall I go call assistance? Lady J. This weakness is unpardonable in me. [Aside. 'Twas but a faintnessâit will soon be over. Here, generous youth, accept this as a token Of my esteem. [Offers a purse. Hen. If I decline your offer, 'tis because I'm young and strong to labour for subsistence; While there are thousands who are old and feeble, To whom your charity would give new life. [Going to the window, L. 'Tis she!âMy Jane!âShe beckons me to come, Impatience in her looks! I must away; 'Tis treason, when love calls, to disobey. [Bows respectfully, and exit, L. D. Lady J. [Crossing to window, L.] Henry has already reach'd the lawn; His Jane receives him with a fond embrace; Now, on the wings of love, they fly along! Oh, happy pair!âMay troubles ne'er annoy, Nor clouds obscure the sunshine of your joy! [Exit, R. SCENE III. âExterior of Walter's Cottage. Robinette and Buckram discovered at the table eating and drinking. Rob. (R.) Come, Mr. Buckram, I think you've had enough now for a tailor. Buc. (L.) Only another cup of ale, my dear, and then I shall do remarkably well. Rob. [Archly.] About a thimble full, I suppose. Buc. A pert young hussy! A thimble full, indeed! Rob. [Pours out some ale, offers it to Buckram, but first drinks herself.] Here's your very good health, Master Snippy; and I wish you a plentiful crop of cabbage, with all my heart! Buc. [Taking the cup.] Saucy young minx! Why, my dear, this cup is not a quarter full. Rob. No matter; it's more than enough for the ninth part of a man. Ha! ha! ha! [Runs from the table. Buc. Pert little devil! [Rises in a pet.] The ninth part of a man! 'Tis ridiculous in me to mind such stuff, but, somehow or other, such insolence always throws me into a pucker. [Running after Robinette.] Why, you audacious little baggage!âyou insignificant little hop-o'-my-thumb!âhow dare you call me the ninth part of a man? If I catch you, I'llâ Enter Walter, Jane, Henry, and Villagers, R. U. E. Wal. (C.) Lord Raymond's proposal really astonished me. I always thought him partial to my Jane; but never dreamt that he intended honourable marriage. Hen. (L.) Nor does heâI would stake my life upon it. 'Tis but a scheme to rob me of my happiness. Wal. Nay, Henry, judge not rashly. When his lordship heard Jane's resolve, he proffered her his friendship. Hen. That offer fills my mind with apprehensions. Jane. (L. C.) Fear not a lord, my Henry: thou'rt to me More than an emperorâay, though he were The monarch of the world. Buc. (R.) Well, honest Walter, so you're returned again. What measures have you taken, eh? Any news stirring at the castle? Do tell us all about it; hav'nt heard a syllable of news since ten o'clock this morning. Wal. I have no news that's pleasing, neighbour Buckram. [Trumpet sounds to arms without. What means that martial sound? Buc. A declaration of peace, or a proclamation of war, I dare say. I long to hear the particulars. Enter Edwin, running, R. U. E. Edw. (C.) Oh, dear! oh, dear!âHere's a pretty business! âInstead of our getting married, they're going to take us all for soldiers. Buc. What, tailors and all? Edw. Ay, every soul of us. We are all to march directly to fight the rebels. But here comes Lord Raymond. [Grand flourish. Enter Lord Raymond in armour, with troops and attendants, R. U. E. Lord R. We march directly: all, without exception, Who are not aged or infirm, will join The yeomanry. It is the queen's command. [Retires up. Buc. [Begins coughing violently, and suddenly pretends to be lame.] I'm one that's not fit for a soldier, however.â This church-yard cough and poor lame leg of mine will be the death of me. Good bye, neighbours. [Hobbles off, R.âEugene, a yeomanry officer, follows him. Lord R. (C.) [Advancing to Jane.] It grieves me, lovely Jane, that I'm compell'd To tear your Henry from you. We all go; And Henry, in the field of bloody strife, May prove him worthy of so good a wife. [Trumpets and drums sound to arms. Hen. Fear not, my love; though duty calls me hence, We soon shall meet again. Jane. I will go with thee. Though but a weak maiden, I fear not death. No!âIn the battle-field, This eye shall be thy swordâthis heart thy shield! Away! [Crossing to R., is met by Lord Raymond. Lord R. It cannot be, fair maid; yet, thy dear Henry Can write thee love-epistles from the camp, And thus beguile the time till he returns. Jane. Kind thanks, my lord; and I've a messenger To bring the tender tidings. For a moment I crave your patience. [Music.âExit into cottage, then re-enters with a cage, in which are two doves; she takes out one of them, and gives it to Henry. Here, Henry, is the messenger I spoke of; And, trust me, he'll not loiter on his way: For here's his mate. [Pointing to the other dove in the cage.] They are a loving pair, And separation would be death to both. Fate tears him from his love, and thee from me; In that there's much resemblance between us. When thou hast written what thy heart dictates, Then tie thy letter, with a silken cord, Under his downy pinions, and he'll fly, Swift as an arrow on the wings of love, To her his heart holds dear. His tender mate I'll keep within my bosom; she'll need comfort Till her true love returns. Enter Old Francis, L. U. E. Fra. (C.) An't please ye, where is the brave youth who saved my lady's life? [Seeing Henry.] Ah, now I see him. [To Henry.] Here, young man, her ladyship greets you, and sends you this picture of herself, in token of her gratitude. [Henry kneelsâFrancis hangs the picture around his neck, where Jane's picture hangs already. Lord R. (L.) [Aside.] Her gratitude! Her love, she should have said. Ah, sister, thou art caught! Wal. Come, Francis, take a cup of ale with us. Fra. Ay, marry will I; a cup of good ale is what I like, and, never fear, I shall very soon get at the bottom of it. Lord R. We can delay no longer; time is precious. Hen. Dearest Jane, farewell! [Embraces. Jane. [Sobs.] Farewell, dear Henry! Lord R. [Aside.] E'en take thy last embrace, fond doting pair! Henry, thy doom is fix'd!âBe that my care. March! [The Yeomanry march off across the hillsâHenry, holding up the dove, exchanges love salutations with JaneâEdwin and Amy do the sameâLord Raymond expresses his satisfaction in a demoniac smileâBuckram is dragged on by Eugene, and forced to follow the troops. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe open Country. Enter Ethelbert and Hardolf, cautiously, R. S. E. Eth. (L.) Hush!âMethought I heard the trampling of horses; if so, we must be on the alert. Where is Fernwold? Har. (R.) Gone foraging for provisions. 'Tis high time, I'm sure, we had something in the shape of a dinner, or the crows will very shortly make a meal of us. Eth. Very true, Hardolf; we are, indeed, a set of poor miserable wretches. Har. How so, captain? Eth. Why, look ye: first of all, the tyranny of the great, who rule the land with an iron sceptre, forced us to take up arms in our own defence; that they call rebellion, and send their soldiers to cut us down like grass. Now, we are reduced by defeat and ill-success to wander about the country, and take whatever we can find, to satisfy the cravings of natureâthat they call robbery; so that, look which way we will, death stares us in the face; for none but a fool would expect mercy from Lord Raymond. Har. Why, then, stand thus shillishalli? Since tyranny has reduced us to such extremity, why not declare war against the whole human race at once? I only wish my comrades had chosen me for their leader; I'll wager they'd have been a devilish deal better off than they are now. Eth. Thou art no flatterer, Hardolf, to tell me this to my face. However, if our comrades repent their choice, they can easily fix upon some one else; but this I am resolved onâas long as I am their commander, our swords shall never be drawn against the defenceless. Har. What! not if we are starving? Eth. No, not even then. Better to die by inches than have innocent blood to answer for. [Crosses to L. Har. (R.) Ha! ha! ha! Do the tyrants who oppress us think so? Where is there a more cruel and merciless villain than Lord Raymond? Eth. Let him look to himselfâI'll not imitate him. Yet live we must; and, whenever we happen to meet with a haughty lord, a purse-proud citizen, an overfed parson, or a lawyer laden with plunder, I'll be the very first to attack and ease them of their superfluous pelf; but never let me catch a man under my command offering the least violence to the poor. If I do, death shall be his portion. Har. Well, don't be angry, captain. [Aside.] A stupid fool!âI wish I was leader! But, see, here comes Fernwold. Enter Fernwold, and others of the Rebel Party, L. Fer. (L.) The queen's troops, headed by that remorseless tyrant, Lord Raymond, have discovered our retreat, and are hastening hither to rob us of all we have left in the worldâour lives. Away!âWe have not a moment to lose. Eth. Now, then, my gallant comrades, be firm. If we shrink from danger, we know our doom. The mountain pass is the only way now left us to life and liberty. Away! [Exeunt, R. S. E. Enter Lord Raymond, Henry, Edwin, Officers, and troops, L. S. E.âGrand Flourish. Lord R. (C.) If our information be correct, The remnant of the rebels are now lurking About these parts; not daring openly To face us in the field, but plundering, Assassin like, the poor defenceless traveller. To your posts; and show no mercy to the wretches. Rush on, and cut them down!âFor, when the poor Rebel, they are but whetstones to our swords. Murmur they mayâay, and petition too, And humbly beg redress on bended knee; But, if impatiently they fly to arms, To fight for what we prudently deny them, We then let loose our bloodhounds, to destroy Their lives and hopes at once. 'Tis policy. [Trumpet without. Enter an Officer, L. Offi. My lord, a party of the rebels have been observed making in haste towards the mountain pass. Lord R. We'll intercept them by a nearer path. Some men, when cross'd in love, lose charity, [To Henry. And hate their rivals; yet we will be friends, Though we do both adore one lovely object, A maiden worthy of a monarch's throne. You she prefers, despising all advantage Of fortune. Honour, therefore, now compels me To think no more of her. Yet, favour'd youth, I feel an earnest interest in your welfare, And will, if you deserve it, which I doubt not, Do all I can to further your promotion. Hen. (R.) My lord, your kindness is a spur to action. Give me a post of honour and of danger; And, if I shrink from death, hold me a wretch, Unworthy of Jane's love and your protection. [Bows. Lord R. 'Tis well. Then hasten to the narrow pass, Through which the rebels mean to cut their way. Their numbers are but few, yet desperation Will make them fight like lions. Hen. And lions they shall find to combat with. Away! [Exeunt all but Lord Raymond, R. Lord R. Enthusiastic idiot! Go, fight on! If thou escape, then to more desp'rate means I'll have recourse. Assassinationâay, Or poison! Anything to rid me of thee. Fate, I am thine! If thou propitious prove, Let Henry ne'er return to joy and love! [Exit, R. Enter Eugene, L., driving Buckram on before. Eug. (L.) Come, move on, sirrah. I'll soon make a soldier of you. [Puts a helmet on Buckram's head, knocking it over his eyes.] Now, hang on your sword. [Buckram awkwardly obeys.] Why, I declare you look quite a different man altogether now. Buc. (R.) [Coughing.] Now, pray, Mr. Officer, do considerâwhat use should I be in the field of battle, with this poor lame leg, and terrible churchyard cough? [Coughing. Eug. No hesitation, sir, orâ [Raising his sword. Buc. Come, come, I say; take care what you're about with that great bodkin. Eug. Will you march, I say? We shall be too late. Buc. What, to get our throats cut? Plenty of time for that, believe me. But you will let me just stop to tie my shoe-string, won't you? Eug. Not a moment. March, I say! Buc. Oh, dear! what a terrible stitch that was in my side! Oh! I'm extremely ill! This is cruel usage for a poor, weak, lame, consumptive creature, like me!â Oh, dear! oh, dear! [Exit, driven off by Eugene, R. SCENE II. âA Romantic Pass in the MountainsâAlpine Bridge, &amp;c. Enter Henry, Edwin, and Troops, L. U. E. Hen. (R. C.) This is the pass; yon bridge must be defended, cost what it will. Edw. (L.) But, I say, Henry, if anything serious should happen to us, what would become of the poor girls at home? When do you intend to send off Mr. Pigeon, the postman, with a letter, eh? Hen. Soon as we know the issue of the combat. Where did you leave the pretty bird? Edw. At our head-quarters, the village alehouse; and I told the hostess to be sure and give him plenty to eat. Hen. Alas! poor thing; I fear he will not eat. Edw. Why not? Because he is in love? So am I, too, over head and ears; yet my appetite's as good as ever it was. No, no: if I were to starve myself to death, I might as well be shot dead at once; and then what would poor Amy do? Our sweethearts are really to be pitied, poor girls; for, if they were to lose us, they might search the world through before they'd find two such nice, charming, agreeable young men, as you and I, Henry. Hen. Fear not, my friend. Heaven will protect the man who does his duty; And cowards are not worth a fair maid's love. [Horn sounds without. Hark!âThe appointed signal. To the bridge! [All advance to the bridge. Enter Eugene, driving Buckram along as before, L. Eug. (L.) Now to show your courage. This is the field of battle. Buc. (R.) And a cursed ugly-looking field it is, too. Not a morsel of cabbage growing in it. Suppose, now, I were to climb up this tree; I could give you warning of danger, you know. [Offers to climbâEugene pulls him down. Eug. No skulking, sir. To your postâfollow me. [Retires to the bridge. Buc. To my post! I wish I was a post myself, or anything but what I am. Egad! I've a mind to put my best leg foremost, andâ [Is about to run off, R., when he is alarmed by the report of a musket; he then runs to L., and is driven back by a second shot; he scampers about, confused and terrified, and at length climbs up a tree for protection. Enter Ethelbert, Hardolf, Fernwold, and Rebels, R. Eth. (R.) Now, my brave companions in misfortune, to force the mountain pass, or perish in the attempt!âIt is our only way to life and liberty. [Advances with his men to the bridge. Hen. [From the bridge.] Halt, rebels!âYield, or die! Eth. Never! [A general combat; the rebels retreat, and draw the yeomanry from their position; they are at length compelled to retire, pursued by the rebels, R. Buc. [Peeping out.] There's precious work for you! The coast is clear, however, at last; so I'll descend, and make the best of my way home. [Comes down from the tree.] What folly it is to go to war!âAs if there was any pleasure in a man's getting his throat cut, or a great button-hole made in his body! [Gun fired without.] Oh, dear! oh, dear!âThere it goes again! Now, legs, be true as gold, and swift as lightning! [Runs off, L. Loud Alarum. Re-enter Hardolf, Fernwold, and several Rebels, with Henry, a prisoner, bound, R. S. E. Fer. (R.) So, you are compelled to yield at last, my fine fellow? Hen. (C.) Since you are brave, be merciful as well; not for my sake, but the dear girl I love. Har. (L.) Oh, you're in love, are you? Ha! ha! ha! But, come, let's see what you've got about you. [Observing Jane's and Lady Jane's pictures round Henry's neck.] A picture!âAnd here's another. [Tears them off his neck, and hangs them round his own.] Two devilish fine girls, upon my soul! You seem to have been a mighty favourite with the soft sex. How many sweethearts have you got in all, eh? Hen. [Struggling.] Unfeeling monsters!âStrip meâleave me nothing, But that dear picture! Fer. So, one of them is your favourite, I suppose.â Poor girl, I pity her with all my heart! But say, youngster, have you got any money about you? Hen. NoneâI am poor; yet, surely, poverty is not a sin. Har. So great a sin, that you've no hope of mercy; so here goes. [Offers to despatch Henry. Enter Ethelbert, rushing between, with several followers, R. Eth. Hold!âWho dares harm that youth? He has fought bravely, and therefore should be by the brave respected. He is our prisonerâlet that suffice. Convey him hence, well guarded. Away! Hen. Oh, for a sword, that I might cut my way, Through a whole host of foes, to her I love! [Exit Henry, guarded, R. Edw. [From the bridge.] This way, my lord. They were too many for us before; but now I think we are more than a match for them. [Grand flourish and alarum. Enter Lord Raymond, with Yeomanry, from the bridge.â The Rebels, after a short resistance, are subdued and bound. Lord R. (C.) Convey the miscreants hence, and guard them well. Edw. (L.) [Looking round.] But where is Henry? Har. (R. C.) If you mean that milk-faced lady-looking youth, who gave us so much trouble, he's safe enough. Edw. What, a prisoner? Come, some of ye [To the Yeomen]; we'll rescue him if he were in the clutches of the devil himself. Lord R. Stay, Edwin. I lament poor Henry's fate; Yet, recollect we've prisoners to guard; 'Twere hazardous to leave them. Edw. What! let Henry remain in the hands of such cruel bloodthirsty monsters! No, never! To save my friend, damme but I'd disobey the queen herself, and take the consequences. So, come along, some of ye, to Henry's rescue. What! not a soul offers to stir! Well, no matter; give me but another sword for Henry, and here goes, single-handed, to save my dear friend's life, or perish in the attempt! [Exit, R. Lord R. Hence with your prisoners, [To the Yeomanry. And wait for further orders at the inn, Where we have fix'd our quarters. [Pointing to Hardolf, who is still bound. This miscreant I will myself examine. [Exeunt all the Rebels but Hardolf, L., guarded by Yeomanry. Come hither, fellow. If the countenance Be, as some say, an index to the mind, Thy heart must be one foul and loathsome mass Of black deformity: thy scowling brow Betrays the tempest of a troubled soul, And stamps thee reprobate. What wouldst thou do For life and liberty? Har. (L.) Anything, my lord. Lord R. These baubles I shall keep. [Taking the two miniatures from Hardolf's neck.] Yet I'll not rob thee, Though thou art a robber. There's ten times the value Of such a paltry booty. [Throws him a purse. Har. Your lordship's very gracious; but, unless my hands be untied, the purse may lie there till doomsday, ere I can take it up. [Tries in vain. Lord R. If thou for gold wilt do a desperate deed, I will unbind thee. [Unbinds his hands. Har. I'll do anything, my lord, for libertyâ[Eagerly snatching up the purse.]âand money. Lord R. Thou shalt have both. Now mark well what I say: Shouldst thou betray me, thou, as rebel, diest With thy companions. It would not avail thee To say thou wert my hireling: thy oath Would never gain belief 'gainst the mere word Of Raymond. You beheld that youthâyoung Henry? Har. I did, my lord. Lord R. He is my bitterest enemy; Yet from no private motiveâthat were wrong. I fear he may prove dangerous to the state, Through his great popularity, and wish He were remov'd. You understand me well? Har. Perfectly, my lord. And the rewardâ Lord R. Should he be rescued, and thou do the deed, A thousand crowns, besides thy life and freedom. Har. Agreed! But I've no arms. Lord R. [Giving a dagger.] Take thou this dagger. At the inn to-night, When all are buried in the arms of sleep, Thou canst perform thy task. Fear not detection; I will protect thee from all consequences. Trust thou my word. [Crosses to L. Har. And mine, my lord. Lord R. Nay, I would rather trust that look of thine, Which speaks hell's language plainer than thy tongue! If thy hand falter at the bloody deed, Let thine eye be its prompter, and the scene Of murder will not halt. Away!âRemember time and place.âBe firm! Har. Ay, as a rock, my lord. Yet, should I be questioned who 'twas unbound me, what am I to say? Lord R. Leave all to me. The vilest rogues, supported by the great, Are often used as instruments of state. [Exeunt, L. SCENE III. âOutside of a Country Inn. Enter Buckram, L., running, quite out of breath, and splashed all over with mud. Buc. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I narrowly escaped being overtaken, by wading through a horse-pond. I declare I feel quite exhausted, and extremely uncomfortable.â Ah, here's a friendly inn. [Knocks. The Hostess appears at the window. Hos. Who's there? Buc. A gentleman traveller, ma'am, in need of some refreshment. Open the door, if you please; I've not a moment to loseâI must be off. Hos. You'll excuse me, sir, but I never open the door to any suspicious-looking characters in these troublesome times, especially when my husband's not at home. Buc. Suspicious-looking characters! What do you mean, madam, byâBut, no matter; you'll hand me a cup of sack through the window, I suppose, won't you? Hos. Oh, certainly, sir, as many as you please. [Goes from the window. Buc. If she had but a civiller tongue in her head, this country hostess would be a nice comfortable woman enough. And her husband not at home! Egad! I've half a mind to jump in at the window, and pay her my respects. I never found a woman in my life that didn't fall desperately in love with me after five minutes' conversation. The lavish hand of nature must certainly have made me very engaging. Ah, here comes the charming hostess with my sack. Hos. Here, sir, is a cup of as excellent sack as ever moistened a gentleman's lips, since the days of Adam and Eve. Buc. [Smacks his lips.] Very acceptableânever was so dryâinside, I meanâin all my life. [Offers to take the wine. Hos. [Drawing back the cup, and holding out the other hand for money.] One shilling, sir, if you please. Buc. Oh, very well, ma'am. 'Pon my word!â Pretty behaviour this, to a gentleman of my cloth!â But you shall have your shilling, ma'amâoh, yes!âI'd not have you for a moment imagine that a person of my respectability is without a shilling in his pocket. [Feels in his pockets.] Why, odds bodkins and shears!âHow the devil is this? May I never stitch a button-hole again, but I left home in my hurry with empty pockets! I'm not master of a farthing!âBut never mind: you'll trust me, ma'amâI know you will. I see good nature in your agreeable countenance. Hos. None of your flattery, Mr. Snip. I'm not to be imposed upon by gentlemen of your cloth; for I neither take in swindlers, nor suffer them to take me in. Ah! here come the brave yeomanry, who have fixed their head-quarters with me. Now I shall not want for protection. Buc. [Alarmed.] The yeomanry!âThe devil!âThat dreadful intelligence is enough to make a gentlemanâ run as fast as his legs can carry him. [Scampers off, R. Enter Eugene, with Yeomanry and Rebels, L., the latter bound. Hos. [Opening the door.] Welcome, gentlemen; this way, if you please. [Exeunt Hostess, Eugene, Yeomanry, and Rebels, into the inn. Enter Lord Raymond, followed by Hardolf, L. Lord R. (L.) This is the innâyou know the rest.âBe firm. What ho! [Knocks at the door. Re-enter Hostess, courtesying. Lord R. [To Hardolf.] Go inâI'll come anon. [Exeunt Hostess and Hardolf into the inn. Henry not yet return'd! 'Tis a good omen: He may, perchance, ere this have met his fate, Without my interference. Would it were so! I then might reap the harvest of success Without the stings of conscience. What an idiot Am I to talk thus! Conscience, I defy thee! Hence, with thy babbling!âthou spurious brat, Of prejudice and superstition born! I'll revel in delight until it cloys, In spite of thee, thou mar-feast of man's joys! [Exit into the inn. SCENE IV. âA Room in the Inn.âTwo practicable doors in flat, with window, L.âover the Chimney-Piece, a loaded Gun, near which is Henry's Pigeon in a Cage. Eugene, Yeomanry, and Prisoners, discovered at table; Hardolf sitting apart, L., drinking, the Hostess, C., waiting on him. Eth. [Aside to Fernwold.] Our comrade, Hardolf, seems to have got mightily into favour with Lord Raymond. As sure as death, that scoundrel has betrayed all our secretsâI knew he was a villain. Eug. [To the Yeomanry.] Retire, and take some refreshment. Guard well your prisoners; if but one escape, remember you answer for him with your lives. [Exeunt Yeomanry with Rebels, all but Hardolf, R. S. E. Hos. Ay, if they offer to stir, shoot the villains! I always keep a loaded gun in the house. [Exit, L. S. E. Har. A loaded gun!âEgad, I should like to render that harmless before I perform the task assigned me by Lord Raymond. I'll discharge it; and yon pigeon will serve both as an excuse and a mark to shoot at. [Takes the pigeon out of the cage, throws it out at the window, and fires.] Down he goes!âNoâhe mounts againâhe's only wounded. Enter Lord Raymond, R. D., Hostess, L., Eugene and Yeomanry, alarmed, R. Hos. (C.) Murder! fire!âWhat's the matter? Lord R. (R.) Have any of the prisoners escaped? Har. (L.) No, my lord; I only shot at a pigeon for my own amusement, that's all. Hos. What, that pretty innocent little creature? Get out of my house directly, you cruel monster, you. Lord R. Nay, nay, good woman. I know the man, and answer for his conduct. [A loud knocking at L. D. without. Hos. Who's there? Edwin. [Without.] Open the door; here's Henry safe and soundâI've rescued him. Hurrah! Lord R. Perdition!âHenry safe! [To Hardolf.] You know the rest. [Exit Hardolf, R. D. Hos. [Opening the door.] You're welcome, gentlemen. Edw. (L. D.) Here he is, safe and sound, though I had a hard struggle for it! Hen. To friendship do I owe my life, and now, Since danger is no more, let's think of love, And send some tidings to the darling girls, Who wait impatiently to hear from us. Edw. So do, Henry; write something quite tender and sentimental, d'ye hear? Yet, upon second thoughts, you may as well spare yourself the trouble, as we all march home to-morrow morning. Lord R. Not so: for, though the rebels are subdued, It were not safe to quit the country yetâ Henry and you remain; and, since you both Have prov'd yourselves most worthy of my confidence, I leave you in command till further orders. Edw. You are very kind, my lord; but really we are not in the least ambitious: all we wish, with due submission, is to make haste home and get married. Lord R. Full time enough to run into the snares Which woman lays for inconsiderate youth. [Crosses, R., to Henry. It grieves me sorely, Henry, to inform you, That the poor bird your Jane gave you at parting, Has, by a most untoward accident, Been suffer'd to escapeâyet write your letter, And, as I journey homeward, I will be Myself your messenger. Hen. (C.) My lord, you are most kind: what ho! good hostess. Enter Hostess, L. Pens, ink, and paper here. [Exit Hostess, L., and re-enters, L., with pens, ink, and paper. Hos. Here, sir, is every thing you called for. [Exit, L. Lord R. Be brief, young man; for I depart to-night [Exit, R.. Edw. Well, Henry, I'll not interrupt youâour supper is ready; when you have done, you'll join us. [Exit, L. Hen. [Solus.] Delay in love is death, by slow degrees! Oh, what are rank and titles but a sound, To him whose soul longs for more pure delights? This cruel separation from my Jane May prove most fatal to our happiness. Lord Raymond goes to-night: does he mean well He seems so friendly, that I dare not doubt himâ Now for a few fond words to her I love. [Sits down at the table, and writesâHardolf slinks in behind him, R. D., with a dagger in his hand, and is about to stab him, when Lord Raymond, who follows, arrests his arm. Lord R. [Softly.] Not yet. [Lord Raymond retires with Hardolf, R. D.âHenry finishes and folds up his letterâan alarm of drums and trumpets is heard without. Hen. [Starting up, and leaving his letter on the table.] To arms again! What can this tumult mean? [Rushes out, L. D. Enter Edwin and Yeomanry, R., who follow Henry in haste. Enter Lord Raymond, cautiously, R. D. Lord R. Whence this alarm? No matter, here's the letterâI'm curious to know what he has written. [Opens the letter and reads.] âDearest JaneâKind heaven has hitherto protected me from every danger. We remain still some time here to watch the rebels, which grieves me, as I long to be with the dear object of my affections. As for the other Jane, whose picture I wear, though I pity, fidelity to thee forbids my loving her. Lord Raymond has kindly offered to be the bearer of these few lines from thy faithfulâ âHenry.â Lord R. Short, but expressive; and the whole contents As applicable to my sister, Lady Jane, As to the Jane for whom they are intendedâ And luckily the letter's not directedâ That task be mineâ[Goes to the table, and writes the direction on the letter.] 'tis doneââTo Lady Jane.â The poisonous seeds of jealousy once sown In the fair maiden's bosom, she is mine; Her love was gold-proof, knowing Henry trueâ But when she thinks him faithless, she will grasp My offer with an eager handâsuccess! Re-enter Henry, Edwin, and Yeomanry, L. D. Hen. 'Twas but a false alarm. [Goes to the table to direct his letter, when Lord Raymond stops him. Lord R. [To Henry, L.] Fearing you might not speedily return, I have myself directed your love-letter, And now depart. Good Henry, fare you well. [Exit at L. D. Edw. (C.) Come, Henry, your supper will be cold. Hen. (R.) I want no supper, Edwin, for fatigue Has quite subdued my spirits, and sleep invites me. Enter Hostess, L. S. E. Hos. Gentlemen, I am sorry to say my house is so full, that one of you will be obliged to sleep in yonder arm-chair, but I'll make it as comfortable for you as I can. Edw. Very well; I'll sleep in the arm-chair with all my heart. Hen. Nay, go to bed; I wish to be alone: My mind is melancholy, and the jesting Of our jocose companions would ill suit The sadness of my thoughts. Good night, dear Edwin. Edw. Well, Henry, e'en as you please. Good night! [Exit with Hostess lighting him, R. Hen. I've often heard it said, that strange forebodings Seize on the heart when danger is at hand: Yet what have I to fear? This peaceful dwelling Affords secure reposeâwhence, then, this tremor? 'Tis the effect of wearinessâno more. Come, sleep! thou sweet reviver of the spirits; Into thy arms I sink: and, gracious heaven, Bless thou this house, and all who dwell therein! Dear Jane! had I thy picture, which the villains stole, I now could press it to these longing lips! Sweet love, good night. [Sinks asleep on the chair. Enter Edwin and Ethelbert, softly, R. Eth. (R.) Since you have treated me with such humanity, I'll do all I can to serve you. Edw. (L.) You suspect your comrade Hardolf of some foul design, you say? Eth. I do; for even now I overheard him say, drawing a dagger, âHe sleeps! now's the time!ââBut soft, he comes this way! let's step aside and watch him. They retire. Enter Hardolf, R. D., with a drawn daggerâHe first convinces himself that Henry is asleepâHenry, by moving his arm, throws down and extinguishes the lampâstage dark. Har. Yonder he slumbersâthat sleep shall be his last. This to his heart. [Offers to stab Henry, but is prevented by Edwin and Ethelbert, who had closely followed him, unperceivedâHardolf drops the dagger. Edw. [Calling out.] Murder! lights here! [Henry starts up alarmed. Enter Hostess, followed by Eugene and Yeomanry, with lights. Hos. Mercy on us! what is the matter? Edw. Why, that villain attempted to murder Henry. Hen. Detested wretch! what had I done to thee, To prompt thee to so foul a deed? Har. Nothing particular: I was hired by Lord Raymond to do your business for you.âI don't care who knows itâif you doubt my word, yonder lies his lordship's dagger, and here's my reward. [Shows the purse with an insolent smile.] He's a good employer who finds both tools and wages. Edw. [Binding his hands.] Never fear, I'll take care of you. Eug. And I'll take care of the dagger. [Picks it up. Hen. Nor shall the noble miscreant escape. Retire to rest, my friends: to-morrow's dawn Shall see us on our homeward march again: And if in England justice be not dead, This treachery shall cost Lord Raymond's head. [All form a picture, Hardolf struggling with Edwin and the Yeomanry, till the scene closes. SCENE V. âA Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lady Jane, in black, R. D., followed by Old Francis. Fra. (R.) Prithee, now, good my lady, be comforted; and tell your old and faithful servant the cause of your grief. Why do you assume this mournful dress? It reminds me of a funeral. Alack! there is no rest, I fear, but in the grave, and I almost wish I was myself at the bottom of it. Lady J. (L.) Good Francis, that my heart is sorrowful I'll not deny. The cause remains a secretâ You say the youthâI mean young Henryâ He did accept the picture which I sent him? Fra. Ay, marry did he, my lady; and it would have been most unpardonable insolence in him to have refused it. I hung it about his neck myself with these aged hands. Lady J. And did he gaze upon it? Speak the truth. Fra. No, my dear lady, he did not gaze upon it; and it vexed me sorely, after such an astonishing proof of your ladyship's great condescension, to see young Henry's eyes so firmly rivetted, not on your picture, but on Jane, old Walter's daughter. I thought it vastly mysterious, and tried all I could, but in vainâI could not get at the bottom of it. Lady J. [Crosses to R.] Enough! now hasten to the neighbouring convent, And say that Lady Jane requests an audience Of the good mother abbess. Fra. (L.) Why, my dear young lady, you surely do not mean to shut yourself up in a nunnery? Lady J. Good Francis, go; and do as I command you. Fra. I will, because I needs must, my lady: mercy on me! go into a nunnery in the very spring and blossom time of life! heaven forbid! Rather than ever live to see that day, I'd suffer myself to be thrown headlong into the castle ditch; though I'm sure, if I was, I should very soon get at the bottom of it. [Exit, L. Lady J. Fond, foolish heart, be still! it is in vain! Why, then, thus agitate this heaving bosom? If 'tis a crime to love, I am a sinner, In need of more than ordinary penance! [Exit, R. D. SCENE VI. âExterior of Walter's Cottage. Enter Jane, from the Cottage. Jane. 'Tis a most lovely morning; yet they say An early sun shines rarely through the day. I have had dreams to-night, which might alarm A heart that had no confidence in heaven, And loved not with unlimited affection. Methought I wander'd o'er the field of battle, And found my Henry welt'ring in his blood: My screams awoke him from his death-like trance; And, casting up his lovely eyes, he cried, âOh, Jane! beware Lord Raymondâhe's a fiend, Such as are none on earth, and few in hell!â Then, pressing to his lips my trembling hand, He breathed a pious parting prayer, and died. Rob. [Appearing at the cottage window.] I see nothing of your favourite pigeon yet, sister. Jane. The messenger of love not yet returned! Spur thee, dull time, and doff thy leaden wings! At love's call thou shouldst fly more swiftly far, Than thou art wont to do at eventide, When loving youths and maidens, void of care, Enjoy their sportive gambols on the green, And chide the parting hour. Enter Lord Raymond, in haste, L. U. E. Lord R. (L.) Where is Walter? Jane. (R.) Within, my lord; and Henryâ Lord R. Is well, I hope. [Looking up to heaven. I wish to see your father. Jane. I go, my lord.âWhat means this mystery? [Exit into the cottage. Lord R. [Solus.] She mustâshe shall be mine! My rival, long ere this, has met his fate: he is no more! Enter Walter from cottageâJane remains anxiously listening at the cottage-door. Wal. (R.) My lord, I joy to see you safe return'dâ What news? Lord R. (L.) None of good import, Walter; it is true, We have repulsed the rebelsâyet poor Henry! [Feigns griefâJane is greatly alarmed. Wal. What of him, my lord? Lord R. Alas! he is no more. [Pretends to weep. Jane. [Rushing frantic between them, and kneeling to Lord Raymond.] Oh, gracious heaven! recall that horrid word, For pity's sake! Plant daggers in my bosom, And I will hold it as a deed of mercy; But do not say, my lord, that Henry's dead! Wal. (R.) Do, my dear lord, revoke the dreadful tidings! For Henry was so good, so brave a youthâ We all adored him. Lord R. (L.) Would it were possible! but truth is sacred! He fell a victim to the foul revenge Of an assassinâyet, my pretty Jane, Trust me, he was unworthy of thy love, For he did love another. Jane. (C.) 'Tis false! and though from heaven an angel came To blast mine ear with such foul calumny, I'd not believe him! Henry prove untrue! As easy might the ewe become a wolf, And lacerate the tender lamb she bore, Or mothers give their children gall for milk, As Henry prove a traitor to his love! My lord, I know him better. [Crosses to L. Lord R. (C.) [Producing a letter and Jane's picture.] Walter, Peruse that letter; [To Jane.] and, if you still doubt, Here is your picture, which he sends you back, Declaring he preferred to wear my sister's. Jane. [Dreadfully agitated.] Kind heaven, preserve my reason! Wal. [After reading the letter, hands it to Jane, who also peruses it.] 'Tis villanous! Lord R. [To Jane.] Still doubtful, lovely Jane? Jane. Henry dead, and faithless ere he died! Impossible! [Regarding the letter and picture. Yet these are dreadful proofs. He kept her picture! Lord R. Since all obstructions are at length remov'd, Now, Walter, let me urge my own pretensions; I love your daughter, Jane, as well, you knowâ Her hand will cancel every debt between us, And make us friends for ever. Her refusal I shall resent with a becoming spirit, And let impartial justice take its course. Wal. Come, my child, think no more of this Henryâ He has most shamefully deceiv'd us all, For which he now must answer to high heaven. Lord Raymond claims thee as his brideâconsent. Lord R. Ay, lovely Jane! speak, for it rests with you To save your poor old father from a prison. Jane. A prison, said you? 'Tis a cruel word! [Kneeling to Lord Raymond. It came not from your heartâthat heart, my lord, Which is so noble, just, and generous. Lord R. Why parley thus? Wilt thou be mine or not? Wal. Come, Jane, this obstinacy is absurdâ Decide, then, quickly; wilt thou wed Lord Raymond? Jane. [Heroically.] Never! Lord R. Unpardonable insult! [Crosses to L. Wal. (R.) Then I disown thee, stubborn, self-will'd girl! I will to prison, and my latest breath Shall call down curses on the unnatural child, Who felt no pity for her poor old father Jane. [Between both, imploring, C.] Father! for mercy's sake! My lord, in pity spare me! Wal. Thou know'st my temper, Jane: wake not the lion That slumbers in my bosom, or I may Most grievously offend 'gainst heaven and thee. No answer yet? Perdition seize thee, then, Thou ingrate child! hence from my door for ever! Go! wander as a beggar through the world, A wretched outcast, friendless, and forlorn! Bareheaded may the tempest overtake thee! Barefooted mayst thou tread on naught but thorns! A miserable monument of vengeance! Jane. Father, in pity hear me! Wal. Begone! and detestation follow thee! I will to prison; and, while I languish there, May conscience lash thee with her scorpion scourge, From door to door to beg for mouldy breadâ Thy beauty blasted, and thy reason fled! [Jane utters a piercing shriek, as if deprived of her reason. Lord R. Come, lovely Jane, speak but the word; and say Thou wilt be mine! Jane. [Piteously regarding her father, and smoothing down his gray locks with her hand.] Oh, yes, certainlyâI will be your's, my lord: I could do any thing to save these venerable locksâOh, yesâyes. Lord R. [Exulting.] She's mine! success! Jane. Did I say yes? Forgive me, heaven! [Staring at Lord Raymond for a moment, then turning from him with a shriek of horror.] No, never! never! [Tears the bridal flowers from her hair, and in a fit of frensy rushes off, L. U. E. Lord R. Perdition. [Exeunt, R. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lord Raymond, R. D. Lord R. Since threats avail not with the stubborn girl, I'll try severer measures. What, ho! Francis! Enter Old Francis, R. D Fra. (R.) I am here, my gracious lord. Lord R. (L.) Tell me the exact amount of Walter's debt. Fra. Five hundred and five-and-twenty crowns, my lord; neither more nor less: and he declares he'll pay it honestly, which I firmly believe, as soon as prospects brighten with him a little. Alack-a-day! troubles will overtake the best of men sometimesâthis is a fickle world: the wheel of fortune is always going roundâ sometimes we are at the top, and sometimes at the bottom of it. Lord. R. Psha! cease thy idle prate, and hear my orders: I'll not have Walter longer for a tenantâ Go thou, distrain his goods, and turn him out. Fra. What, my lord! turn out a worthy tenant, who has honestly paid rent to your lordship's father and yourself for upwards of thirty years! Turn him out, indeed! now that misfortunes have overtaken him! You never can be so cruel, my lord! no, no! Lord R. Peace, graybeard! and obey me; for, by heavens! I'll not be trifled with! My blood is boiling, And I will have revenge! Go, turn the dotard out; Send him adrift: ay, and his daughter, too! E'en to the dogs with 'em, for aught I care. Fra. [After a short pause.] Do it yourself, my lord; I'll not be the instrument of such cruelty. No, not if you were to cast me into the deepest dungeon of your castle, and keep me there until I die, without a bit of straw at the bottom of it. Lord R. You dare dispute my orders! [Seizing him. Know'st thou not, hoary fool, this arm could crush thee? Fra. Yes; and a noble action it would be of you to strain your vigorous nerves to harm a poor old man, and offer insult to gray hairs. Oh, fie on't! shame! shame! Lord R. Tutor me not, but go and do my bidding. Fra. My lord, I will not stir an inch to do an act which conscience cannot justify; and I repeat, if honest Walter must be turned out of his cottage, do it yourself, my lord. Lord R. Send Rupert hither; he is not so squeamish. Fra. Nay, good my lord; I pray you be merciful: yet, if you still insist on the instant payment of honest Walter's debt, the money shall be forthcoming. Lord R. Where should the pauper get so large a sum? Fra. From a good friend, my lord; and I am that friend. During the forty years that I have had the honour to serve in this castle, I have laid me by some hundreds of good and lawful coin; ay, and it delights mine eyes to see the shining gold, because I know that poverty is grievous in old age; yet 'twill delight my heart much more to part with it, if I can save an honest man from sinking. I will pay Walter's debtâhe shall not go to prison! Thanks to my frugality, I've got a good long purse, and to assist a friend in distressâI don't care how soon I get at the bottom of it. Lord R. What! wouldst thou throw away the staff of age? Be lavish of thy substance unto those Who would not even give thee in return A crust of bread, if thou shouldst come to want it? Go to! thou art again in leading-strings! [Crosses to R. I will bethink me how to treat this Walter. Fra. (L.) That's right, my lord, do soâconsider better of itâreflection is to passion what water is to fire. [Aside in going.] Turn out an honest tenant into the wide world! Shame! shame! If ever I am guilty of so base an action, I wish I may go to a certain place when I die, and have a precious warm berth at the very bottom of it. [Exit, L D. Lord R. I loathe the very name of man, and would I were some savage beast, that I might glut Myself with blood, not fearing an hereafter! Psha! that's an idle phantasy! a dream! Were the assassin, Hardolf, now but here, He should set fire to old Walter's cottage; And fortune, then, not I, might bear the blame Of the fool's sufferings.âI'll do't myself! 'Tis shameful, whispers honourâwhat care I? Revenge and passion prompt me to the deedâ I'll execute it, e'en though hearts should bleed. [Exit, R. S. E. SCENE II. âWalter's Cottage. Enter Amy and Village Maidens, R. U. E. Amy. (R.) Oh, I'm so rejoiced! I've just heard that the wars are over, and the yeomanry on their march home again. Ah! yonder comes neighbour Buckramâ now we shall hear the news. Enter Buckram, L., splashed with dirt. Buc. (L.) Thanks to my invincible legs, here I am once more, after all my hardships, safe and sound, at home. Amy. (R.) Welcome from the wars, neighbour; what news? Buc. Bad enough, my dear: there has been terrible work. Never saw such cutting up and cabbaging in all my life before. Scarcely a remnant left of half the brave fellows who marched with me into the field of glory. Amy. Mercy on me! I hope no harm has happened to my dear Edwin? Buc. Oh, no; not much, my dear: he has only been run through the body with a pike nine feet long, just here, under the short ribsâsuch a button-hole! Amy. [Nearly overcome.] Heavens! what, dead? Buc. Can't say, indeed, my sweet little daffidown-dilly, whether the wound proved mortal or not, for I left head-quarters rather suddenly, having been sent off with despatchesâI look like a courier, don't I? But as to your sweetheart, I don't think you stand the least chance of ever beholding him again; for, from the desperate nature of his wound, just under the short rib, I'd betâ A golden Henry to a base brass button, That Edwin, long ere this, is dead as mutton. Amy. Oh, dear! oh, dear! I shall cry my eyes out! I'm sure I shall. Buc. Nay, don't do that, my sweet little bit of velveteen; if one sweetheart is dead, you can easily get another, you know. What say you to me? I'm a devilish clever fellowâhow do you like me? Amy. Not at all, sir, I thank you. [Sobs.] And, if my dear Edwin is no more, I'm resolved to die a spinster. [Crosses to L. Buc. (R.) More fool you, I say; and, trust me, you'll repent your rash refusal of my generous offer, for, let me tell you, 'tis no small honour to get a handsome young man like me for a husband, and one who has been bravely fighting in the wars for his queen and country, and now returns covered with dust and glory. Hurrah! success to the brave! Now to deliver my despatches! [Exit, R. Amy. Edwin dead! Oh dear, oh dear! what will become of me? [Exit in tears, with Villagers. Enter Robinette from Walter's Cottage. Rob. Heigho! I am quite melancholy! Henry, they say, is deadâpoor sister Jane gone nobody knows whither âand father is so cross, I'm almost afraid to speak to him. [Looking up.] What's that? Our little pigeon coming home from the wars; but he's brought no letter. [The bird falls at the child's feet.] Poor thing!âHe's all over blood, tooâ[She takes up the pigeon]âbut not quite dead. I'll nurse himâperhaps he may recover. [Looking off, L.] What man is that yonder in a long red cloak? He looks very sly. I'll step aside, and watch his motions. [Retires behind a tree, R. Enter Lord Raymond, L., in a long cloak, with a dark lantern and torch. Lord R. Now for the deed, which shall completely place The maiden in my power. Should I expel them For a mere debt, the world would cry out shame Upon my conduct; but, if they be burn'd out, As 'twere by accident, she must submit To my conditions, or be doom'd to wander A beggar through the world. Now to my task. 'Tis lucky no one's near. [Lights the torch by the lantern, and fires the cottage. Walter. [Within.] Help! help!âFire! Lord R. The neighbours are alarmedâI must away. [Exit, L., dropping his cloak. Enter Walter in despair, from the burning cottage. Wal. (L.) Robinette, my child, where art thou? Rob. (R.) [Running from her hiding-place.] I am here, father. [Walter embraces the child, kneelingâthe neighbours run to his assistance from R. U. E.âthey form an interesting picture, and the scene closes. SCENE III. âA Landscape. Enter Henry, Edwin, and Yeomanry, with the Rebels chained together, L. S. E. Hen. (L.) Thus far kind heaven hath sped us on our way To home, dear home, again, and those we love! Eth. (C.) You may rejoice, young man; for love awaits you, while we have nothing to expect but death. Edw. (R.) Poor fellows!âWho knows but her majesty may take pity on you, considering you were brought into this trouble by the cruel tyranny of Lord Raymond? Enter Eugene with a paper, L. S. E. Eug. Success!âGood news! good news! Edw. What's it all about, eh? Are all the young men and virgins going to get married? Eug. Not exactly that; but an officer has just joined the army, with her majesty Queen Elizabeth's most gracious pardon to the prisoners, and an order instantly to release them; those only excepted who have wantonly shed innocent blood. Omnes. Hurrah!âLong live the queen! Hen. It joys my heart to raise a suffering brother To hope and happiness; and proud am I To be the instrument of giving you Both life and liberty. [Directs Eugene to unbind the Rebels. Edw. [Pointing to Hardolf.] All but one, Henry, if you please. Har. And why not me, too? Have I shed innocent blood? Edw. But you would, though, if I hadn't prevented you; recollect that, if you please. Hen. Yet I forgive him. Eug. Pray, is not that fellow's name Hardolf? Har. That is one of my names, sure enough. Eug. [Looking over the paper.] Then his name is expressly included in the list of exceptions. Har. No matterâdamned if I care! Many's the brave fellow has been hanged before now. Hen. [Crosses to R.] Now, brother soldiers all, without delay, Sweet home be our watchword!âMarch away! [Exeunt, R. S. E. SCENE IV. âA wild rocky Glen, overgrown with thorns and briarsâa rude hut, L.âa tree, with a seat or bank of flowers under it. Enter Jane, wildly, her hair in disorder, R. U. E. Jane. Follow me not, my lord!âIn pity spare me! Bid me to plunge into the raging ocean, Nurse serpents in my bosom, sport with tigers, Or drink in copious draughts the rankest poison, And I'll obey; but ask me not again To be your wifeâ[Shuddering.]âNo!âThat were hell on earth! [Looking wildly around. I am safe nowâhe will not find me here! Distractedâhouselessâfatherlessâforlorn! Here in this dreary wilderness I'll dwell; These rugged rocksâthese naked thorns and briars, Are emblems of my fate!âThis is my home! [Takes the dove out of her bosom, and reclines on the ground. Sweet innocent companion of my woes! My fellow-mourner!âWe are both lovelorn Thy mate's untrue to thee, as mine to me. Perchance he, too, is dead; but, my sweet bird, Mourn not, for I will keep thee in my bosom. Yet what would that avail thee? This poor heart Is now as cold and comfortless as ice! Ah, me!âWe are both poor and destitute! Heaven pity us! [Kisses the dove, replaces it in her bosom, and rises wildly. Henry faithless!âHenry dead! Beauty blighted!âReason fled! Wonder not poor Jane ran wild, When her father curs'd his child, [Shuddering. And her lover prov'd untrue! Have you ever lov'd? Or you? Have you felt the joy and gladness When at eve your love return'd? Have you felt the cruel sadness, When affection he has spurn'd? Maidens, wonder not to find Base deception in mankind. Lovers seem sincere and tender During courtship, sighing, praying; But, when you your hearts surrender, Then they glory in betraying, And you look for love in vain, As was the lot of Crazy Jane! AIRâCrazy Jane. âFondly my young heart receiv'd him, Which was form'd to love but one; He vow'dâhe swore, and I believ'd him: He was false, and I undone! âFrom that hour has reason never Held her empire o'er my brain; Henry fled!âWith him for ever Fled the wits of Crazy Jane!â [Exit into hut, L. SCENE V. âA Chamber in Lord Raymond's Castle. Enter Lady Jane, R. D., alarmed; she goes to the window, through which the conflagration of Walter's Cottage is visible. Lady J. Poor Walter's cottage burn'd! I do suspect Some vile incendiary. His daughter, too, The lovely Jane, distracted! Good heavens! that misery should overtake The virtuous in this world, while villany Escapes the rod, and laughs at innocence! Francis, come hither. Enter Francis, L. D. Fra. (L.) Did you call, my lady? Lady J. (R). I did, good Francis. Take this purse of gold, and hasten with it to relieve poor Walter. Fra. Ay, marry will I, my lady, in a moment; and do you only look out at the window, if you please, and see how nimbly I will run across the lawn. I am an old man, 'tis true; yet, in a good cause, I can run as fast as a grayhound. But I'm glad you've given over all thoughts of the nunnery. Lady J. Lose not a moment, Francis, but begone. Fra. Ay, that I will, my lady. I'll runâI'll flyâI'll âBut you'll not forget to look out at the window, and see me run along. I've got a tremendous long flight of steps to go down before I reach the lawn; yet, in a good cause, I shall very soon be at the bottom of it. [Exit, running, L. D. Enter Lord Raymond, in breathless haste, R. D. Lord R. The deed is done, and no one knows of it! Lady J. [Overhearing him, and coming forward, L.] If you've done evil, brother, rest assur'd That there is One, whose penetrating eye Pierces the inmost secrets of the soul, And sees where all besides himself are blind. Lord R. Sister, I'll not be school'd. Hence to thy chamber! [Crosses to L. Lady J. (R.) Yet say, what hast thou done, my dearest brother? Lord R. (L.) A deed which hell devis'd, yet heaven look'd on, And saw me execute; therefore, a deed of fate. Lady J. May heaven pardon thee, whate'er it be! I have observ'd of late thy alter'd temper: You were once mild, affectionate, and kind; Now your eye rolls with passion's angry fire, Filling your sister's soul with anguish. Say, What troubles you, my brother? Speak, I pray. Lord R. [Affectionately taking her hand.] Thou art a good girl, Jane; thy brother feels Thy worth, and yet he never can disclose, Not e'en to thee, the secret griefs that wring His tortur'd breast, and goad him on to madness. Men of strong passions are the toys of fate,â The tools of hell! That I am what I am, Lies in my blood; else why do flames rage here? While other virtuous souls are cold as ice, Why doth this eye speak such terrific language? This aching heart teem with infernal thoughts? Did I create myself? Noâno!â'Tis fate! Laugh, demons, if ye will! I, too, can laugh At poor impotent manâHa! ha! ha! ha! Vice is a giantâVirtue a poor dwarf! Else would she crush her daring adversary; Not let him range, to damn, without control, That precious jewel, man's immortal soul! [Crosses to R. Enter Old Francis, L. D. Fra. [To Lady Jane.] My lady, I am sorry to say I cannot find old Walter anywhere: his cottage has been burned to the ground, and he has wandered thence distracted. Lady J. (C.) Go, try againâmake due inquiry; Give him the money to relieve his wants. Lord R. Give Walter money!âGive him poison rather! [Aside.] Have I for this done such a ruthless deed, To place him in my power? Give me the purse. Fra. [Quickly hiding it.] I'll fetch it, my lord. [Aside.] If I do, I wish I may tumble from the top of the staircase to the bottom of it! [Exit, L. D. Lord R. To be thus thwarted! Oh, malicious fate! Lady J. His look appals me. Heaven have mercy on him! [Exit, R. S. E. Re-enter Old Francis in haste, L. D. Fra. My lord, the people are all in an uproar; they cry, âDeath to Lord Raymond!â Young Henry is returned from the wars, and leads the noisy crew. Lord R. 'Tis false, thou drivelling liar! Henry's dead! [Loud shouts without. Fra. There, I told you so!âNow you'll very soon get at the bottom of it. [Exit. Lord R. Henry alive! Then all is lost for ever! Yet, why despair? Come forth, my sword! I'll meet Barefac'd rebellion with determin'd front,â Outdare the bully, and e'en death defy! For undisturb'd I'll live, or bravely die! [Exit, L. S. E. SCENE VI. âWild Rocky Glen, as before.âViolent Storm, with Thunder and Lightning. Enter Walter, R. U. E. led by little Robinette, with Lord Raymond's red cloak on her arm. Wal. (R.) This tempest is an emblem of my fate. Here let us rest, my child; my feeble limbs Will carry me no further. Rob. (L.) I wish the neighbours had been a little quicker: then they might have seized the villain who set fire to our cottage. Wal. Ruin'd, and by a vile incendiary! Remorseless wretch! I never injur'd thee! I injur'd no man. Art thou sure, my child? Didst mark the villain well? Rob. I did not see his face; but, in making his escape, he dropped this cloak, so that I hope he'll be discovered, and brought to justice. However, my dear father, the cloak will serve to shield you from the fury of the tempest. Wal. We'll share it, love; else thou wilt be exposed to the contending elements. Rob. Oh, I don't mind, so long as my poor old father doesn't suffer. Wal. Thou art a dear good child; yet, who can tell? When you grow older, you, too, may prove ungrateful. Rob. Never, with heaven's blessing! But you are faint and weary. Come, father, sit you down awhile. [Crosses to R.] I see a hut yonderâI'll knock and ask for some refreshment for you. Who knows, perhaps its inhabitants may be charitable. [Walter sits down on a bank, L. Wal. A draught of water's all I crave, my child. [Exit Robinette into a hut, R. Wal. I've read in history of old King Lear; His two ungrateful daughters drove him mad. Was it a wonder? I am nearly so, That have but one. Thus to refuse Lord Raymond, When her consent had sav'd her poor old father! Oh, most unnatural child! Oh, cruel Jane! [Sinks exhausted. Enter Robinette from the hut, leading her sister Jane. Jane. (R.) Water, my dear, for a poor weak old man? What use is water? I will give him wine. I love old men; for I've an aged father, Whose heart is good, though he did curse his child. Rob. (L.) Why, Jane, my dear sister! don't you know me? What makes you live in this wild desolate place? Have you forgotten your poor old father Walter, Henry, Robinette, and all of us? Jane. [After a pause.] Walter!âHenry!âRobinette! Those names Were dearer once to this poor broken heart, Than all the treasures of the golden east. But Henry's dead!âand, were he still alive, He'd be a lady's lord, not poor Jane's Henry! Ah, me! we live in a vile wicked world! Heaven mend it! There's no peace but in the grave! Ay, there I'll rest amongst grim skeletons: They'll not deceive me with an outward show Of loveliness, while all is foul within. No!âThey are hideous to the sight, but honest! Seek not rest on a downy bed; Seek it where the silent dead Rest their heads on mother earth: And, believe me when I say, Happier is our dying day Than the morn that gave us birth! [With a deep heart-rending sigh. Kind Heaven have mercy on us all! Amen! Rob. Do, Jane, for pity's sake, help your poor father! Jane. Help!âPity!âThey are words devoid of sense. Call on the howling tempest for compassion,â Crave pity from the tiger of the desert, But ask it not of man, unless he's mad. Yet I am mad, and therefore I can pity. Where is the poor old man? He shall have wine; Yes, wineâwineâwine! [She goes to a rocky spring, R., draws some water in a shell, and gives it to Robinette. Rob. Why, sister, this is water. Jane. 'Tis nature's wine; pure, unadulterated! There's no deception in'tâI hate deception; It has driven me mad! where is the poor old man? Rob. Yonder he sits, beneath that tree. Jane. [Goes to Walter.] Here, sir, is some of nature's wine for you; It will revive your spirits. [Walter looks up, and is about to drink, when, recognising Jane, he dashes the shell to the ground. Wal. (L.) Viper, begone! Rather than wet these lips with aught Thy hand hath touch'd, I'd die of burning thirst! Hence, most ungrateful child! and may the fiendsâ [Jane, with a dawning of reason, recognises her father, utters a loud scream, and drops on her knees. Jane. (R.) Oh, curse me not again! I cannot bear it! My brain is quite distractedâone more curse Will make it burst asunder! Oh, my father! [Gradually approaching him on her knees. In mercy pity me! pity thy wretched Jane, And curse her not! She is thine own, thy poor distracted child! Ah, now I see a tearâand now a smile, In that beloved, venerable face! Your heart relentsâjoy! joy! poor Jane is happy! [Swoons at her father's feet. Wal. My child! my poor lost child! come to my heart! Reviveâlook up, my love! [Military march in the distance. Enter Edwin and Yeomanry, R. U. E., and remain in the background. Jane. [Revives, but relapses into partial delirium.] Hark! Heard I not that warlike measure, When false-hearted Henry left me, And of every joy bereft me, When I lost my dearest treasure? Edw. [Coming forward, L.] Who says Henry's false-hearted? What do I behold! Poor Jane, distracted! What can this mean? Poor girl, how wildly she looks! Don't you know me, Jane? I say Henry's true! Jane. (C.) He was true once; but nowâhere are my proofs. [Producing the picture and letter.] He kept her picture, and return'd me mineâ Heaven pardon him! Edw. I say he was robbed of it; and Lord Raymond took it from the robber again. Wal. (R.) Good heavens! what villany! Edw. And as to this letter, [Opens it] it certainly was Henry who wrote it; but, as I live, it is directed to Lady Jane instead of you; and in Lord Raymond's own hand-writing, tooâoh, the villain! [Tumult without, with cries of âDeath to Lord Raymond! down with him! Enter Lord Raymond, L. U. E., followed by a disorderly Crowd, armed with clubs, &amp;c. Lord R. (C.) Tumultuous rabble! get you to your homes! Or dread my vengeance! Edw. Your vengeance! [Snapping his finger at him.] We don't care that for your vengeance! Enter Eugene, R. U. E. Eug. (L.) No! for here is an order from her majesty to arrest your person. Lord R. Conspiracy! Of what am I accused? Eug. Of having hired the assassin, Hardolf, to murder young Henry Harford. Jane. [Aside to her father.] Oh, horrid deed! Wal. [Aside to Jane.] Be comforted, my child! Lord R. 'Tis false! The villain lies, to say I hired him! Eug. Our proof is this dagger, which you yourself gave the assassin: see, it is your own. Lord R. [Seizing the dagger.] Perdition! Enter Lady Jane, followed by Francis, L. S. E. Lady J. (L. C.) What dreadful tidings! Spare! oh spare, his life! Fra. (L.) Heyday! why, what is this? His lordship's very best cloak lying on the groundâhow came it here, I wonder? I know it well, by this mark at the bottom of it. Rob. Lord Raymond's cloak! then he's the man who set fire to our cottage! Eug. What! an incendiary, too! seize the monster! Lord R. Stand back! he is a corpse who dares approach me! What, die a felon on a public scaffold! No, never! and, since fate will have it so, Thus will I shun disgrace, and die a Raymond! [Stabs himselfâall gather round him. 'Twas a home thrust! I feel life ebbing fast; And, ere I die, let me make some atonement.â [To Lady Jane. Give alms of all my substance to the poorâ I feel it is no easy thing to die, when conscience Is in arms.âOh, what a dreadful pang! Jane, injur'd maid, come hither! fear me not! I cannot harm thee now. Thy Henry Was a most loyal loverâWalter, too! Oh, speak forgiveness! that kind word will prove Sweet music to my soulârefuse me not! Wal. My lord, seek heaven's peace; I do forgive you Jane. And I, too, from the bottom of my soul. Hen. [Without.] What horrid tale is this? My Jane distracted! Where is she? Let me fly into her arms! Enter Henry, R. U. E. Hen. My Jane! Jane. My Henry! [They embrace. Lord R. Henry! thy pardon, too, before I die! [Delirious. Hell drags me down! Avaunt, accursed fiends! Ye shall not have my soul! See, where they come, In legions, to rack these writhing limbs! Oh, mercy! mercy! [Dies.âThe curtain slowly descends to a soft adagio. DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS AT THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. Villagers. Yeomanry. Villagers. Eugene. Jane. Henry. Lady Jane. An Officer. Edwin. Amy. Robinette. Walter. Francis. Dead Body of Lord Raymond. R.] [L. THE END.</field>
