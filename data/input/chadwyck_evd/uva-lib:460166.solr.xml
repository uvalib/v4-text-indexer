      <field name="fulltext">LORD RUSSEL; A TRAGEDY, OF THREE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Persons of the Drama. KING CHARLES THE SECOND, JAMES DUKE OF YORK, EARL OF BEDFORD, LORD RUSSEL, LORD CAVENDISH, MR. SPENCER, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER. LADY RUSSEL, LADY MARGARET RUSSEL. Officers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, during the first Act, in Bedford House, and afterwards in the Tower.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Bedford and Lady Margaret Russel. Lady Margaret. Rest here, my gentle Father! nor again Expose your wearied age and wasted spirits To scenes of such dread influence to shake Each fibre of a heart that feels like yours!â I pray you rest with me! Bedford. My tender child! Thanks to thy filial aid! my strength returns, And my reviving soul has gather'd force To bear the killing sight.â'Tis true, when first I saw my mild and unoffending son, Pride of my age! and England's dear resource In these disastrous days! when I beheld My blameless Russel at that bar arraign'd, Where only guilt and infamy should stand; When I beheld each servile judge support A lawless jury basely fram'd against him, Indignant anguish robb'd my wounded heart Of vital energy: quick from the court My hasty friends hurried my senseless frame, To this our quiet home: but since, my daughter, Thy kind endearing cares have now restor'd me, I will resume my station by thy brother, In these distressful moments:âto his side Affection calls me, and paternal duty. Lady Margaret. Forgive me, that I dare to thwart your wish, But from my generous brother I've receiv'd A kind injunction to detain your age From that afflicting scene. He has engag'd To tell us, by repeated messengers, Each petty circumstance that passes there. Already from the number of his friends He has selected one to bring us tidings: His faithful Spencer comes. Enter Spencer. Bedford. What from my Son?â The sentence is not pass'd! Spencer. No, my dear lord. England is yet unsullied with the stain That must disgrace her, if the sword of Justice Turns to the murderous dagger of Revenge, To stab your virtuous son.âBy his request I come to soothe your anxious sufferings, And to relate the process of a scene, Where he conjures you to appear no more. Bedford. What perjur'd slaves have they suborn'd against him? How far has truth been wrong'd, and law been tortur'd, To frame those snares of legal death, in which They labor to involve incautious virtue? Have they not dealt most hardly with my son? Spencer. He has experienc'd subtle cruelty From venal ruffians in the robes of justice; But the base wrong his patient worth endures, Is the dark soil which gives the diamond lustre. When he requested aid for his defence, His keen insidious foes, who strongly fear'd Some upright advocate might save their victim, Enjoin'd him to employ a servant's hand. There rose indeed a servant at his side, Most eager for the task; but O! what words Can speak the fond surprize, and thrilling anguish, Which shook the bosom of each sad spectator, Who in that servant saw his lovely wife? The crowd, with eyes bedimm'd by starting tears Of tenderest admiration, gaz'd upon her, And murmur'd kindest prayers, as they beheld Connubial love, in that angelic form, Thus firmly yielding unexpected succour To virtue struggling in oppression's toils. Bedford. Most excellent of women! worthy offspring Of my departed friend, the good Southampton! If Tyranny prevails against thy husband, How shall the wretched Bedford's feeble age Support thy widow'd heart? I can no more Than in strict fellowship of bitterest sorrow Echo thy groans, and mourn our mutual loss. Lady Margaret. Do not, dear father, do not yield so soon To comfortless despair!âwe yet may hope The radiant probity of Russel's life Will dissipate each dark and dangerous cloud That perjur'd Calumny can raise around him. Remember all the candor of his mind! Think how his temperature virtues have been prais'd By Envy's self! how to the gaze of youth His conduct has been held up as a book, In which all English eyes may read their duty, And learn the fairest path to spotless honour. Spencer. If abject lawyers, and a venal jury, Should violate the sanctity of justice By Russel's condemnation, still his merits Are grav'd so deeply on the Nation's breast, He stands so firm the idol of her love, Oppression's self will fear to execute The sentence of the prostituted law Against a life so priz'd. Bedford. Alas! my friend, When did a tyrant, like vindictive York, (For 'tis the Duke who thirsts for Russel's blood) When did a spirit of that sullen temper, Impell'd by rancorous hate, by bigot rage, And abject terror, when did such a spirit Respect the virtue, Nature made its foe, And treacherous Fortune gave it power to crush? But tell me of the scene from whence you come! Say! what has been alledg'd against my son? I have been told the fierce and subtle Jefferies, The Duke's base agent in this bloody business, Relies upon the evidence of Howard, As the sure instrument of Russel's death: Unprincipled he is, and prone to utter What interest and fear may bid him swear. What has he said? or is he yet unsummon'd? Spencer. Before I left your son, the faithless Howard Began his artful tale; but soon he falter'd, With feign'd affliction of a dread event, Which suddenly was rumour'd through the court, And struck the throng'd assembly with such wonder, Malice stood mute, and Persecution paus'd. Fresh from the Tower the tidings came, that Essex, From terrors of that bar, where Russel stood, Had with rash violence rush'd out of life, And stain'd his desperate hands in his own blood. Bedford. It cannot be! the firm, the gallant Essex Could never end his being so ignobly; And in the moment, when his generous soul Felt only for his friend; his Russel's life Yet wavering in the balance. Spencer. Such, my lord, Such is the comment of all honest hearts On this dark story.âHeaven reveal the murder, And punish it, though in th'assassin's veins The tainted stream of royal blood may flow!â Soon as the rumour reach'd your son, he bade me Attempt to penetrate this dark transaction, And bring you the result of all I heard; Adding, that in the instant of his doom, He would dispatch to you the noble Cavendish With tidings of his sentence. Bedford. Ah! my friend, The fatal word, that ends his blessed life, Has rung already in my tortur'd ear; For I have seen the venal band suborn'd To purchase, by the sacrifice of truth, The blood of her mild champion. There's his guilt, 'Tis that his pure and patriotic zeal, Guiding the voice of an enlighten'd senate, Has labor'd to preserve the throne of England From that blood-thirsty bigot, at whose feet Her laws now lie, in hasty prostitution, Slaves to a tyrant yet uncrown'd; converted From sacred guards of slander'd innocence, Into base engines of vindictive murder. Lady Margaret. Alas! my father, thou hast judg'd too well: Thy dreadful presage is too soon confirm'd: Behold the zealous Cavendish! he comes With no quick step of joyous exultation; But in his agitated gesture shews A settled sorrow, and a fierce despair Enter Cavendish. I come, my lord, the wretched messenger Of that accurst event, which my weak judgment, Not reaching the extent of human baseness, Had hastily pronounc'd beyond the line Of possible injustice. All the crimes, That coward Tyranny can wish committed, Shall now have credit.âRussel is condemn'd. Lady Margaret. O mockery of justice!âRighteous Heaven! Yet interpose to save him! Bedford. My kind friend, Thou but relatest what a father's eye Foresaw too clearly, when I view'd the jury, So justly challeng'd by my innocent son, Marshall'd without the warrantry of law To ensnare his life. Cavendish. Eternal infamy Fall on the base assassins! chiefly fall On those superior ministers of evil, The treacherous guardians of our trampled laws, Who in the robes of Heaven's high delegates Perform the work of hell! from prostrate Justice Wrest her pure sword, to stain it with the blood Of her most faithful votary! Lady Margaret. Yet try, Try, my dear father, ere it prove too late, By urgent intercessions to preserve him! Your friends are many, and, howe'er inflam'd By the vile arts of sanguinary York, The king has still a tenderness of heart, That may incline to spare my gentle brother. Bedford. Alas! my daughter, cherish not too much A hope, whose cruel failure will impart New poignancy to thy too keen affliction! All the mild virtues, which to thy pure sense Plead for thy brother's safety, in the ear Of envious Hate and terrified Oppression Cry loudly for his death. Cavendish. He shall not die. What! though the blood-hound Jefferies has fasten'd His fangs upon him! though the barbarous judges Would make the temple of insulted Law The slaughter-house of Tyranny!âthere yet Are means to turn the sharpen'd axe aside, And shield the life of their devoted victim. Bedford. What would thy dauntless zeal? Cavendish. Your gentle son Has such just credit with this injur'd nation, For public virtue, and designs exempt From every selfish bias of the soul, Thousands would throw into extremest hazard Their fortunes, and their being, to preserve The dying martyr of defenceless freedom. I hold it easy, in the very hour Oppression means to triumph in his blood, With some selected horsemen to o'erpower The slaves who guard him, ere they reach the scaffold, And bear him swiftly to a safe retreat. Applauding millions will assist his rescue, And bless the efforts of his brave deliverers! Bedford. No! Cavendish! by friendship's holy ties, That prompt thy generous purpose, I conjure thee To think of it no farther. Cavendish. What! my Lord, Shall we look tamely on, and by connivance Be made a party in this legal murder? Bedford. Dear ardent friend! there are disastrous times, And this is one of them, when all the functions True courage is allow'd to exercise, Are resignation and a brave endurance. My word is given to thy kind thoughtful friend, To check all desperate sallies of affliction, All, that the fond intemperance of love Could hazard for his safety. Cavendish. Generous Russel! By Heaven 'tis happier far to share thy death, Than live, to see our wretched country robb'd Of all her hopes in thy unequall'd virtue. Bedford. To me much happier!âto a father's heart It would be consolation and delight To perish with his child; but there are duties More painful to sustain than the short struggle That ends our mortal being:âand to us These duties now belongâlet us remember The trust that he bequeaths!âhis wife! his children! 'Tis ours to live for them. Remember too His noble answer to the princely Monmouth, Offering to share his prison and his fate! Did he not say, it would embitter death To have his friends die with him? Cavendish. O my Lord! Your sorrow is of pure and heavenly temper; Mine the fierce anguish of indignant frenzy: Pray pardon it! Bedford. Pardon thee! gallant spirit! Thou bright example of exalted friendship! Thou hast my love, my fondest admiration; In my just heart thou rankest with my children, And art the pillar, now my Russel falls, That my weak age must cling to for support. Cavendish. In duty, my dear Lord, though not in merit, You may account me your's: and pitying Heaven May yet, in mercy to a nation's prayers, Spare to your virtuous age your worthier son: I cannot bend my spirit to admit His fate inevitable: gracious Powers! Who watch o'er suffering virtue, who inspire The prosperous deeds of chance-defying friendship, Assist my lab'ring and distracted brain, Whose faculties are on the rack to find Expedients to preserve our country's pride, The friend and champion of her faith and freedom, From the base stroke of tyrannous revenge! Bedford. Vain are those anxious thoughts: the vigilant eye Of keen Oppression will secure her victim. The nerveless arm of childhood could as soon Wrest from the tiger's gripe his bleeding prey, As we by violence deliver Russel From the vindictive York. Cavendish (after a pause). I thank thee, Heaven! The bright idea is, I feel, from thee: And it has chas'd the darkness of despair From my o'erclouded mind. Bedford. What means thy ardour? Cavendish. Good angels have suggested to my soul A project yet to save him. Bedford. Name it! name it! Cavendish. Your pardon, my dear lord!âaccept alone This firm assurance, that my new design Has nought of rash exertion to involve A single life in danger! or if one, It must be mine alone; and in this crisis, How gladly shall I yield my life for his, And die triumphant in the blest exchange! [Exit. Lady Margaret. Brave Cavendish!âHe's goneâYe saints of heaven; If friendship, like your own, deserves your care, Go ever with him, and from all the perils, That wait the noble self-neglecting spirit, Protect him! and assist his godlike aim! Preserve this matchless pair of gallant friends, And let them shine the ornament of earth! Bedford. Thou pray'st in vain, dear child!âthis dauntless friend, Transcendent as he is in truth and honour, Can nought avail us: he must prove the dupe Of ardent passions and of sanguine virtue. If there's a ray of glimmering hope, that yet May faintly lead us through this night of horror, It cannot rise from any bright endowments In those we love, but rather from the vice, The abject vice, that glares in our oppressors. Our tyrants are necessitous, and thirst For gold, as keenly as for innocent blood. Kind fortune, haply for this great emergence, Has made me master of no common wealth; And this, with lucky art distributed Among the needy minions of the king, May purchase still our Russel's forfeit life.â Come! my dear child, retire we to consult On this our sole resource! Thou will not scruple To meet, and to embrace a noble poverty, If thy lost portion can redeem thy brother! Lady Margaret. Blest be thy happiest thought, my tender father! All wealth, all good is center'd in his safety; And, witness Heaven! my heart would freely bear All the loath'd hardships of the houseless vagrant, And think them blessings, if they aught conduc'd To rescue Russel from a traitor's death.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Lord and Lady Russel in Prison. A Table with Papers, Pen, and Ink. Lady Russel. Must I intreat in vain?âAlas! my Russel, Where is thy sweet compliancy of soul, That made, till now, thy Rachel's voice a stranger To rude and irksome importunity? Has life so little to engage thy wishes Thou wilt not ask to live? Russel. Canst thou, my love, By so unkind a question canst thou give Such hard construction to thy Russel's thoughts? Where is there one inhabitant of earth, If not thy husband, who has every cause To cherish his existence?âGracious Power! Whose wisdom regulates the lot of mortals, I feel, and with devoutest gratitude Bless thee for signal bounties to thy servant, But most for this, thy best and dearest gift, This lovely virtuous woman; whom to part with Is now my hardest trial: but from thee, Dread Arbiter of every human scene! (However strange to man's contracted sense) This trial comes; O strengthen us to bear it With tender fortitude and meek obedience! Lady Russel. It is our duty still, and Heaven enjoins it, To make all blameless efforts to preserve A life so precious: if thy rigid honor, In pity both to me and to thy children, Will stoop to write one line of supplication To the all-powerful York, he will obtain Thy instant pardon from the pliant king. Russel. Thou knowest not th'inexorable hate Of that blood-thirsty spirit.âIt has pleas'd The author of my life to let the rage Of ruthless bigotry prevail against it: A band of venal or misguided men Have doom'd me to the scaffold, on the plea That I have plotted to destroy my sovereign, Though Heaven and thou, who knowest all my soul, See the base falshood of the bloody charge: But to the voice of Law, however tortur'd, I owe a prompt obedience; nought remains But that I meet the stroke of stern Oppression As suits the votary of Public Virtue. I must not sully, by a base submission, A name yet spotless, the sole legacy It is allow'd me to bequeath my children. Lady Russel. Dear as I hold thy life, which is in truth My only anchor in this sea of troubles, Believe me, Russel, I would rather yield, Without a struggle yield that precious life To Persecution's stroke, rather than lead, If aught could lead, thy clear and resolute virtue To one base act of weakness and dishonour. Russel. Alas! my love, the cloud of thy affliction Has dimm'd thy quick discernment; but the paper, Which thy fond care now urges me to write, Would darken all the story of my life: I must not, in that story's closing leaf, Where Fortitude should fix the seal of Honor, Mar the fair record with a fearful blot. Lady Russel. Dear Russel! exercise thy purer judgment; These are not scruples of thy manly reason, But niceties of proud fantastic honor, Of honor jealous to a vain excess. How can the measure, that my love solicits, Involve thee in disgrace? Without abasement, Can injur'd Innocence not say to Power, Give me the life, of which Iniquity Has made thy voice the arbiter? Russel. Thou knowest, Dear inmate of my secret soul! kind prompter Of my best thoughts! it has been long the aim Of my past life to win my country's love; Not by the popular arts of vain ambition, (Which Nature never form'd me to possess) But by incessant vigilance to shield Our faith and freedom, by an ardent wish To prove that patriot virtue, (the stale jest Of servile spirits, as an empty name) Is an existing vigorous principle In minds of English temper. I have fail'd In the prime object that my soul pursued, To save our pure religion and our laws From Bigotry's encroachment; and I lose My life, endanger'd by that noble conflict: But I have gain'd, and let me still preserve it! The kind esteem of this enlighten'd nation: This I must forfeit, forfeit all the praise And influence of no inglorious life, If I become an abject suppliant To that fierce zealot, from whose iron rod I strove to shelter this devoted land. Lady Russel. No, Russel; the corrupted lips of Faction Are prone to evil: but the voice of ages, The sentence of the world, is firmly just; And by that sentence thou art sure to stand High on the list of those bright characters Immortaliz'd with pure idolatry By Truth and Freedom; men whose very name Is sweetest music to the ear of Nature. If in a future age, when we are dust, Thy virtues can be question'd, it must be By sycophants, who, flattering royalty, With slanderous surmises would degrade Each just antagonist of lawless power; Or by those yet more abject enemies, Those sceptics of a cold sarcastic spirit, Who, judging from their own contracted hearts, Possess no confidence in human virtue. Russel. Affection over-rates thy Russel's merit: But let this fond opinion of his fame Preclude thy vain request, which, being granted, Would but afflict thy love. Consider well How it would wound thy generous pride, to hear Thy lord had stain'd the life thou deem'st so glorious By an ignoble eagerness to live. Lady Russel. Believe me, Russel, it would wound me more To think that, deaf to all my just entreaties, My husband, careless of his orphan children, With sullen dignity threw life away, Rather than stoop to sue for the remission Of his unrighteous doom. Russel. Alas! my love, Should I implicity pursue the dictates Of all thy fond solicitude, such conduct Would but provoke the insult of our foes, And could avail thee nothing. Lady Russel. Yes, my Russel, Should the relentless York reject thy prayer, In those sad years of bitterness and anguish, When, if the will of Heaven is fix'd to part us, My widow'd soul, with unabating sorrow, Must dwell upon thy image, and for ever Repass in thought these agonizing scenes, It will afford me then a faint relief, To think my active love, in this distress, Omitted nothing, that had duty's sanction, To snatch thee from the scaffold. Russel. Lovely suppliant! Thy virtuous tenderness has melted me; And, though I could not purchase it by guilt, Thy peace is dearer to my heart than glory. Thou shalt not say thy Russel e'er refus'd One prayer of thine:âgive me again the pen My weak disdain rejected. [Russel writes. Lady Russel. Bless thy kindness! Bless thy prevailing love! for I perceive How hardly it has struggled, to obtain This triumph over brave indignant pride, Abhorring e'en the shadow of disgrace.â O thou all-powerful Spirit! who canst make The meanest implements of mortal use Thy ministers of safety or destruction; Grant that this love-directed pen may prove An instrument of gracious preservation! Guide thou my Russel's hand!âinto this paper Pour words of heavenly potency to change The bloody wish of blinded Superstition, And melt vindictive Rancour into mercy! Enter Spencer. Lady Russel. Kind Spencer! opportunely art thou come To chear my Russel's solitary hour, While my keen hopes to win by supplication, From potent York, the pardon of my Lord, Force me to leave him. Spencer. Ill befall the heart That melts not at the voice of such a suppliant! Russel. Good Spencer! thanks to that unwearied zeal Which makes thee frequent in thy welcome visits To a poor captive.âThere, my anxious Love! Take what thy truth and tenderness have forc'd From Russel's frail and yielding resolution: His pliancy, I know, will meet with blame; But those who have a heart to feel thy merits, Will blush at their quick censure, and recall it. Lady Russel. Now let me, Russel! from thy prison fly, Like the exploring dove, whose eager wing Flew from the ark, to visit it again With blest assurance of subsiding storms. [Exit. Russel. My worthy kinsman, when my voice is silenc'd, As soon it will be, witness to the world The tender virtues and connubial love Of that angelic woman!âAnd, I pray, As gentleness and honor have endear'd thee To all our house, do thou, my faithful Spencer, Attend, with pitying care, my wife and father On the dread day that ends our mortal union; Watch them with all the vigilance of friendship, And soothe the recent anguish of their grief. Spencer. Heaven yet, my Lord, may save us from that scene Of private woe and national distress. Russel. Believe me, though I stoop to ask for life, I ask not, thinking to obtain my suit; But from the tender wish to mitigate The future sufferings of a faithful mourner, By this compliance with her fondest prayer. Spencer. The touching eloquence of her affliction, Join'd to the memory of her father's merit, That honour'd servant of the Crown, Southampton, May wrest your pardon from the savage heart Of sullen York. Russel. Impossible, my friend! My life's the prey that his insatiate rage Has keenly chas'dâhe holds it in his toils, And every prospect of escape is clos'd. Spencer. Yet think, my Lord, that other means of safetyâ Russel. No, Spencer: I have thought, I trust not vainly, Of the chief object that my mind must dwell on, How to sustain the trying part to which The will of Heaven appoints me; how to meet The sudden stroke of ignominious death, As may become the man whose life has won From this brave land observance and regard.â O Spencer! when the wearied eye surveys The gloomy face of Earth, the Law's abuse, And Freedom sinking under savage Power, The wreck of Public Virtue, the base arts And treachery of her apostate sons, With all the countless ills that in her train A blind and barbarous Superstition brings; When these are present to the guiltless mind, It seems a fair and blessed fate to fly From this dark den of misery and vice, To the bright presence of divine Perfection! Spencer. Yet of how pure a nature are those blessings This earth would furnish to your rescued virtue! Russel. O gentle kinsman! in my softer hours My heart still clings to those attractive objects Of tenderest attachment; for this heart Was fram'd by nature for the sweet enjoyment Of social duties and domestic bliss. I will avow to thee, (for thy mild spirit Can sympathize in every true distress) That when I think to what excess of anguish I leave the worthiest and most tender wife, That with endearing innocence and love E'er blest a husband, the forbidden tear Starts from my eye perforce, my frame is chill'd, And shudders at the sharp divorce of steel, So soon to fall upon our chaste affection. Spencer. Yet may ye live a blessing to each other; And give a bright example to mankind, That happiness abides with virtuous love!â Life stands within your choice:âthe King, who knows With what a fond respect and confidence The generous people lean to the opinion Of men so rooted in their hearts as you are, Courts your acceptance of immediate pardon; If you will but acknowledge, in his presence, That you believe no subject has a right, However tempted, to resist the Throne. Russel. Have any of my friends suppos'd, that Russel Could buy existence at a price like this? Spencer. The worthy churchmen, who in this vile prison Have been your kind assiduous attendants, Build on this ground strong hopes;âthey have obtain'd The sanction of your venerable father To argue with you this important question; Believing they may lead your candid mind To terms, which, in their cool considerate judgment, Have the clear warranty of truth and reason. Russel. Good men! they are an honor to the church For signal harmony of faith and practice; But haply, cramp'd by piety's nice scruples, Their minds have not expanded to embrace The mighty cause of Freedom.âO my friend! I want the spirit-stirring faculty Of eloquence, to range in bright array The potent claims of Nature, and enlist In her pure service all the noble passions That give distinction to the life of man: But gracious Heaven endow'd me with a heart To act the upright virtuous citizen; And meet the axe, much rather than betray The charter'd rights of this my native land. Spencer. Are you, my Lord, so settled in your thoughts On this nice question, that no arguments May shake the airy fabric of opinion? Russel. Good Spencer, thou hast known me many years, And for a man of plain and simple reason; Which clearly tells me that the King's position, Once granted, sinks the free-born sons of England To the tame vassals of a Turkish despot. My mind can frame no image of a state That laws have limited, without a right To guard those limitations; and my conscience, That higher sovereign, who challenges My first obedience in all points of moment, Will not permit me, by a different language, To purchase life from the deluded King. Spencer. With painful admiration I have heard The steady dictates of your patriot virtue, That will, with mingled agony and joy, Confirm the presage of your noble father. Howe'er he listens, with attentive fondness, To all that friendly zeal suggests to save you, He knows, and glories in your firm adherence To the dear rights of England; nor can wish, Though with the sanction of such friends, to see you Exchange it for the lure of forfeit life. Russel. Although I trust he fully knows that mind, Which his fond cares have strengthen'd and enrich'd With its best powers of manly resolution; Yet, as ill-grounded and distressing doubts Are natural infirmities of age, At times, perchance, my venerable father May fear lest the approach of violent death Should with disgraceful pliancy infect The spirit of his sonâI therefore pray thee Return; assure him, that our pious friends Must lose their well-meant labor in debate: My mind's unchangeable; and gracious Heaven, As my dark fate draws nearer, gives my soul New strength to triumph o'er its shadowy terrors! Assure the tender Bedford, I shall meet The hour of execution as his love Must wish, with that sedate and chearful brow Which suits the guiltless son of such a father. Spencer. My Lord, I will religiously obey you, And on the instant; as I now perceive Your chief heart-chosen friend is come to share The private converse of your precious hours. [Exit. Enter Cavendish. Russel. Welcome, dear Cavendish! my eager heart Has panted for thy presence, keenly wishing To rest the burthen of its cares on thee. Yet, ere I cease to live, O let me take One long farewel of him, whose friendship gave Lustre and value to that life which fate Severely calls me to resign! Cavendish. Which Love And Friendship's voice command thee to preserve.â I come to save thee, Russel! nor must lose One moment in the heaven-suggested plan. Russel. Dear sanguine friend, the fond illusive warmth Of thy kind heart invests thy eager fancy With visionary power. Cavendish. The fiends of hell Shall not defeat the project my good angel Inspires for thy protection!âSwear thou, first, By our inviolate friendship, and by ties Yet stronger on thy heart, thy wife and children, Swear thou wilt grant me one request. Russel. Dear Cavendish, Thou wouldst engage me in some hasty business, Pregnant with danger to thy generous self; Else had thy frank affection ne'er devis'd A bond so needless, to the mind which holds Requests from thee as sacred as the laws Of faith and honor:âbut explain thy purpose. Cavendish. Here, in this happy hour of privacy, Let us exchange our habits; so may'st thou, Muffling thy face as in the veil of sorrow, Pass unsuspected, and elude the guard. Two of our trusty friends are plac'd to meet thee, And all the means of thy escape concerted. Haste, I conjure thee! while I here remain Wrapt in thy mourning garb; but with a spirit Ready to burst into triumphant joy, And mock the baffled malice of thy foes. Russel. Brave Cavendish! 'tis hard to quit a world That furnishes such friends; yet easier this, Than by a hasty flight from death to hazard A life I hold still dearer than my own. No, I can ne'er expose thy generous virtue To that base fate thou urgest me to shun. Cavendish. They dare not strike at me; their venal juries Have past no treacherous verdict on my head. Russel. The eminence of thy exalted virtue Would make thee their sure victim; and perchance The latent ruffians (such I think there are) Who robb'd the injur'd world of gallant Essex, Would double, in the mind of their base master, Their murd'rous merits by dispatching thee. Cavendish. There is no peril; but admit the worst, I want not strength to grapple with such villains, And wear a dagger here to punish them. Russel. Friend of my inmost soul! thy generous offer Yet closer draws those honorable bands That in our mortal pilgrimage have bound us Firm to each other, and, defying death, Will prove to us, I trust, in brighter scenes, A lasting unextinguishable source Of pure ambition and angelic joy. But the kind purpose of thy noble zeal Thy Russel must reject. Granting thy plan Free from all perils to thy precious life, (And it abounds with many most alarming); Flight, howsoe'er effected, would produce Dishonour to thy friend, as wanting trust In spotless innocence or manly courage. Cavendish. The tongue of Slander dares not to impeach Thy fortitude! Russel. Yet more: for I will lay My secret soul before thee.âThou hast seen How far thy friendship and my Rachel's love Have power to make life lovely in my sight; And my kind father, whose declining ageâ But I must pause, and check this natural burst Of tender gratitude.âThou fully knowest All the strong ties that chain my heart to earth; Yet I perceive these adamantine links, Touch'd, without doubt, by heavenly influence, Seem to give way; and my aspiring soul Begins to covet that ignoble fate, Which shews so horrible in vulgar eyes! Cavendish. And canst thou wish to leave us? Russel. O my friend! Among the strongest passions of my heart, Perhaps more forcible than love and friendship, From childhood I have cherish'd an attachment To my brave country:âthough a transient cloud Now hovers o'er her, my prophetic eyes. Perceive that she is destin'd to emerge To happiness and glory. Thou shalt live, Dear noble friend! to view, and to assist This blest event.âThe death I am to suffer Will more contribute, than my life could do, To England's welfare:âin the future fabric, Destin'd to save and to perpetuate The sapp'd foundations of her faith and freedom, My blood may prove a cement; this idea Sustains, inspirits, and delights my soul. Cavendish. Heroic Russel! bright and genuine martyr Of Liberty and Truth! if thou must perish, I yet shall wear, engraven on my heart, The radiant image of thy signal virtues, As a pure charm, of potency to guard The lowliest mind from every servile thought.â Hark! sure I heard the hated voice of York! Dares he insult imprison'd innocence, By venturing to approach it? May we not Move farther off from that detested sound? It shakes my tortur'd brain, and almost tempts me To rush at once, and from the coward breast Of that apostate tear th'envenom'd heart That guides the murd'rous axe against my Russel. Russel. Patience, dear ardent spirit!âCome this way; The adjoining chamber is allotted me For privacy and prayer. Come, to receive The benediction of thy dying friend. [Exeunt. Enter York, with the Lieutenant of the Tower. York. I know some proud abettors of his guilt Are plotting his escape; but mark, Lieutenant, If the convicted traitor in your charge Appear not on his summons to the scaffold, Your life shall answer it. Lieutenant. I trust your Highness Will never see occasion to condemn me For any breach or negligence of duty. Enter Lady Russel. Lady Russel. May an unhappy mourner dare to hope That gracious mercy guides the princely York To Russel's prison? At your feet I fall In my dear Lord's behalf, who in this paper Implores your intercession with the King To save an innocent and injur'd subject. York. Rise, Madam!âTell your Lord, that I forgive him His bold seditious practices to bar My just succession to the English throne; But my allegiance and fraternal duty Forbid me to appear the advocate Of one whose life is forfeit to the law For plotting to destroy my royal brother. In pity to your sufferings, I advise you To waste no fruitless labor in opposing That stroke of justice which we all lament, But which the safety of the realm requires. [Exit. Lady Russel. Thou ruthless hypocrite! thy sullen cruelty Converts the swelling tear of supplication To fiery scorn; and my prophetic spirit Foresees an hour in which thy abject soul, With more than womanish terror, shall implore That succour thy hard heart denies to me. Lieutenant. O Lady! thy unmerited afflictions Have seiz'd a stranger's bosom, and impel me To make some effort to assist thy prayers. The Duke is merciless, and thirsts for blood; But pity harbours in our Sovereign's heart: I know this very morning he has utter'd Words of kind import to your injur'd Lord: If, in some happy minute, you could throw Your sorrows at his feet, they must prevail. He still is in the precincts of the Tower; Wait here some moments, and kind Heaven may teach me To draw him this way yet, ere he rejoins His pestilent counsellor, the cruel Duke. [Exit. Lady Russel. The blessings of my grateful heart go with thee! Good angels second the unlook'd-for pity Of this brave soldier! Grant me power to speak My Russel's wrongs to the misguided King! And thou, blest spirit of my virtuous father, Whose matchless services so well deserve The kind remembrance of a royal master, Inspire thy suppliant child with words to melt The harden'd heart of Grandeur!âHe approaches!â O cruel fate! at sight of my distress He turns, as eager to avoid a wretch He dares not succour!âStay, my gentle Sovereign; Yet stay, yet hear the miserable mourner Who claims thy mercy.âHeaven! he hears my prayer; He stopsâhe doubtsâand his reverted eye Looks kindly back. Behold, my gracious Liege! Behold the daughter of thy lov'd Southampton Prostrate before thee, and yet wanting voice To utter all the just and ardent prayer Her heart addresses to thy clemency! Enter the King. King. Rise, lovely mourner!âbe assur'd I pity Your virtuous sufferings; and sincerely mourn Those hard necessities of state, whose force O'er-rules the milder wishes of my mind To spare the precious life for which you kneel. Lady Russel. If the bright cherub Mercy has inspir'd Your royal bosom with a wish to save him, O let no subtle fiend, with base suggestion, Subdue that heavenly impulse!âne'er was monarch More loudly call'd, by Equity and Truth, To the exertion of his noblest power, The privilege to spare.âSo may my soul Find grace before the judgment-seat of Heaven, As it is sure my Russel never harbour'd A single thought of blood, or aught of evil, Against the life and welfare of his King: Nay more, my Liege; I know his gentle virtue Has often join'd in painful fellowship With bold bad men, whom his pure heart abhorr'd, To lead your child, the young and princely Monmouth, From the dark paths of their pernicious counsel. King. Your Lord is happy in an advocate Of most persuasive powers: I wish, but dare not, To stop the course of the offended law Against the man for whom your tender virtues Plead with such fervency:âmy kingdom's peace Demands the dread completion of his sentence; His rescu'd life would lead triumphant Faction To practices more daring, and distract The agitated realm with civil broils. Lady Russel. Alas! you little know the gentle spirit Of my wrong'd Lord. But if his life is held So hazardous to England's peace, my Liege, O let him pass the remnant of his days Far from this troubled isle:âhis wife and children Will guide th'obedient exile where you order; And, if a desert yields him life and safety, Think paradise is there! King. You touch my soul, Fair suppliant! Let them blame my pliant weakness; I am not marble, and must shew you mercy.â Where is my Lord of Bedfordâwith his son? Lady Russel. No, my kind Sovereign;âshall I fly to seek him? King. Bid him, with instant speed, prepare a vessel, That may convey Lord Russel to the coast Of France or Holland, as our will directs.â Lady, you little know what cruel bars Obstruct the willing step of royal mercy: Kings are forc'd often to do good by stealth, And such is now my curse.âBut let your father Make preparations for a secret flight, And wait our pleasure with the prisoner here. Ere night he shall receive our terms of pardon, And with them an express, though private order For the enlargement of your captive Lord. Lady Russel. May the great Fountain of beneficence, The King of kings, reward my gracious master For this kind promise to his grateful servant!â O my good Liege! let but your own mild spirit Be your prime counsellor, to shut your ear Against the subtleties of cruel zealots; Tranquillity shall bless your safe dominion, And loyalty and love support your throne.â But let me fly to my deliver'd Russel With these most happy tidings of your bounty; And in reiterated prayers to Heaven, For every good on my indulgent Sovereign, Pour forth the fullness of my swelling heart! [Exit. King. How touching is her love! I envy Russel Th'angelic tenderness of that chaste woman. Enter York. York. What! has the whining wife of guilty Russel Pester'd your ear, my brother, with vain tales, To vouch the truth of that convicted traitor? Whose death must now be speedy, to secure Your kingdom's quiet, and your person's safety. King. Brother, your Romish friends incline too much To sanguinary counselsâI abhor them! What, if in pity to a virtuous woman, In kind remembrance of her father's merits, Friend of our exil'd youth, and best support Of our recover'd throne; what if I grant Some little mercy to her urgent prayer, And change her husband's death to banishment? York. By Heaven it must not be!âwhat! when the Law, That faithful guardian of your sacred life, Has past its sentence on your prostrate foe, For base conspiracy and bloody treason, False to yourself, shall you, in weak compassion To an insinuating woman's tears, Thus rescue and empower Rebellion's idol To form a second more successful plot? King. Your hasty fear outruns true policy; And this excess of rigor, which your priests Have taught you, bodes, I think, but little good Both to your power and mine.âYou, when you chuse, May visit Rome; I, brother, am too old To enter once again on foreign travels. York. Nor may we suffer you to fall at home, Through careless indolence, by Treason's dagger. Think not I speak from ancient enmity To this insidious Russel: for myself, He has my pardon for his crimes to me; But the regard I owe your hallow'd person, Leads me to press for his immediate death: Before the house that bears his father's name, The house that hid his bloody machinations, I wish to see the murd'rous rebel die.â But let us haste from hence. I will assemble The members of your council most instructed In this base treasonâthey will clearly prove You have but this alternative to chuse, To execute or perishâOne must fall, The traiterous convict, or the injur'd King. End of ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Lord Russel writing, and attended by Spencer. Spencer. Quit, my dear Lord, your mournful preparation For that unworthy fate, which your blest consort, Here fully prov'd our good and guardian angel, Has happily averted. Russel. When a life Hangs, my good Spencer, on a prince's word, Whose resolution is the pliant slave Of artifice and importunity, Reason disdains to take into account A poor possession held on such a tenure. I can believe the King inclines to save me; But know how soon his unresisting spirit Yields to the voice of that vindictive zeal, Which with incessant and increasing fury Now clamours for my blood:âI therefore hold it The part of prudence to leave nought undone, Which, on a sudden summons to the block, I yet might wish, but want the time to do. Spencer. Useless (though noble) may this caution prove! Russel. Be that as Heaven thinks best.âSince busy Rumour, In his blind haste to catch a fleeting image, Is apt to form a faithless portraiture Of public characters, I here, my friend, Have, as a legacy, bequeath'd the world A true though simple picture of myself. When I am gone, my honest countrymen, Reading this paper, may with confidence Say, Such was Russelâthis account of him Being as clear from falshood and disguise At that which, in his hour of heavenly audit, Must prove the ground of his eternal doom. Here is my latest task: peruse this letter, Which on my death the King is to receive! Spencer. It breathes that gentle magnanimity For which your life is noted. Russel. At the time, The solemn time, when the calm soul prepares For quick departure to that world of peace, Where enmity and anger cannot dwell, 'Tis surely right to close our earthly feuds, And part from all men in pure charity. Though I have never sinn'd against my sovereign. By any deed or thought that meant him ill, In many vain and inconsiderate hours I yet have sported with his name and frailties So idly, that I hold it decent now To crave his pardon for such levities; And, in the gentlest language I can use, To intimate, that, dying thus unjustly, I pardon all promoters of my death, The highest as the lowest. Spencer. Cease, my Lord, To dwell on dying thoughts with eyes that speak Of life and comfort, your deliverer Comes, to restore you to domestic bliss. Enter Lady Russel. Lady Russel. All, my dear rescued Love! all is prepar'd To aid your blest removal from this land Of danger and dissention.âTo your sight Exile shall seem a kind familiar friend, Conducting you to safety and delight; You shall not feel you have a foreign home, For all your house, who live but in your presence, Are fix'd to travel with us:âthe kind Bedford Will to the rough sea trust his feeble age For your society. O had you seen How our dear little ones receiv'd the tidings Of this heart-healing voyage! how they pant To throw their eager fondling arms around you, And welcome you again to life and joy! Enter Bedford. Bedford. Pride of my soul! my dear, recover'd son! Again I view thee, with parental transport, Snatch'd from the broken snares of shameful death By this blest hand!âIn vain thy suppliant father Had offer'd to exchange his envied treasures For that superior wealth, which in his heart Outweighs all opulence:âsullen Revenge, Subduing Avarice, with scorn rejected Thy proffer'd ransom. Blank despair had seiz'd me; But in the hour when human efforts fail'd, This pitying seraph, in a woman's form, Brings heavenly aid, and turns a tyrant's heart To bless the trembling world with Russel's life! Russel. Dear objects of my love! I pray you check This eagerness of joy; for O I feel That it must prove to you the treacherous herald Of heavier grief!âyour kind exulting hope Is a brief day of summer out of season, That, promising to end stern winter's tyranny, Does but supply to his suspended breath The power to pierce more deeply:âpray be caution'd, And with just foresight arm yourselves against The certain rigour of th'inclement time. Bedford. Has not the King relented, and engag'd His royal word to save and set thee free? Russel. Alas, my father! had his word possess'd That stedfast sanctity which should belong To the pure breath of princes, this fair isle, Who trusted in his faith, had never known Her present depth of national disgrace: Have we not seen our sovereign's promises Proverbially invalid?âHere comes one Whose message will, I doubt not, end the question. Enter an Officer, who beckons Russel, and speaks to him aside. Bedford. O my dear daughter! the high flood of hope Sinks in my heart, and leaves a hideous void. Lady Russel. Speak, speak, my Russel! is it life or death? Russel. Patience, sweet sufferer!âPray inform the sheriff, Although this short and peremptory summons Savours of cruel haste, he shall not wait. [Exit Officer. Russel. Ye, whose keen sorrow has more power to shake The heart of Russel than th'impending axe, By our pure love let me conjure ye now To reconcile your grief-distemper'd thoughts To Heaven's dread pleasure; who, for some high purpose, Permits the oppressive doom of innocence! The King has signified he cannot save me, And I must die to-day. Lady Russel. Perfidious cruelty! But I will fly, and by my loud complaint, Waking dead Honor in his wither'd mind, Force from the treacherous King his promis'd mercy. [Exit. Bedford. I yet will make one hopeless effort more To stop the vengeance of insatiate York. [Exit. Russel. Go, ye kind beings! for the busy love That finds employment, though in fruitless labor, Lightens the pressure of the grief it bears.â Thou seest, good Spencer, that my tender wife Is now supported by her zeal to save me; But on my death, the quickness of her spirit Will work like latent fire within her heart, A slow consumer of her wasting frame. It is her fate that wounds meâfor my own Is but the shortest and most easy passage From earthly trouble to celestial joy. It is the fancy of the vulgar mind That foolishly arrays the dreaded form Of sudden death in visionary horrors: Believe me, Spencer, in the month just past, The transient sickness of my lovely boy Press'd harder on my heart, and more disturb'd The native calmness of my even spirit, Than my near prospect of the ready scaffold. Spencer. Yet, my dear Lord, I view with aweful wonder The firm serenity of soul you shew On this hard test of human fortitude! Russel. Reflect, my friend, that my imprisonment Has made the fearful image of my fate Familiar to my thought. It is surprize That gives to Death his most appalling power; To the clear eye of guiltless Contemplation That gloomy spectre grows a gorgeous herald, Whose trumpet sounds the triumph of the soul, And speaks its entrance on the stage of glory. How grand! how pregnant with delight and wonder, Must be the change of scene from earth to heaven!â What if a mortal, who had pass'd his days In the dim cavern of a noxious mine, Worn with hard toil, where health-annoying vapours Vext and confounded his imperfect sense; If such a mortal suddenly were laid On the bright summit of a lofty hill, To taste the balmy sweetness of the morn, And, for the first time, see the rising sun Array this fair and smiling earth in all The radiant loveliness of form and colour!â O Spencer! if I felt for self alone, This period, deem'd the saddest of my life, Could only fill my mind with heavenly joy; But for my mourning friends, and most for her Whose faithful love has many years to weep, My falt'ring heartânow give it strength, good Heaven! For even now its hardest trial comesâ My Rachel, in the anguish of despair, Returns to take a long and last farewell. Enter Lady Russel. Lady Russel. Dear Russel, I renounce illusive hope! And now must teach my weakness to sustain The heaviest load of misery that ever Fell on the bleeding heart of helpless woman!â The King denies thee, what the basest felon. Asks not in vain, the respite of a day. Could'st thou believe it? he and savage York Are now, like blood-hounds, come to hunt thee hence, And drive thee to thy death! they but allow me A few short minutes, in a last embrace To clasp, to bless, and part with thee for ever! Russel. Then may we part as we have liv'd, my Rachel, In the pure dignity of perfect love, Unstain'd by weakness! Lady Russel. Do not dread my tears; They cannot fall to melt thy manly firmness, For Heaven has steel'd me for this aweful hour. Russel. Thou dear angelic spirit! 'tis from thee That I have learnt the truest fortitude; A courage built upon a heavenly basis.â O gracious Being! who has guided us Through fourteen years of pure domestic bliss, The best and rarest of thy gifts to man, Accept, as tribute for thy blessings past, Our meek submission in this trying hour Of thy more dreadful pleasure!âat thy call I yield my guiltless life, nor would decline To die for having struggled to preserve Thy purest worship in my native land. O that my blood might quench that fatal torch Of barbarous Superstition, which begins To shed once more its sanguinary glare Over this frighted isle! Might Russel prove The last to perish by oppressive power, And the base sentence of perverted law!â Fall not my blood on the misguided men Whose fury sheds it!âAs I truely pardon My ruthless enemies, so, Heaven! may'st thou Take to the charge of thy heart-healing mercy This my chief care, this dearest, last concern Of my departing soul, this spotless woman! Lady Russel. Let not thy fears for me, my generous Russel! Too fondly agitate thy feeling mind; The gracious Power who blest us in each other, Will not, I know, abandon utterly An unoffending, weak, afflicted woman, Dear to so pure a spirit, sanctified By the kind prayers of an expiring martyr! Russel. My Love! I will not to thy care commend Thy little orphans; for an angel's sight Cannot in tender vigilance surpass The anxious mother, who survives to shield The infant pledges of our chaste affection! No, let me press a charge upon thy memory, Where I most fear thy failure, thy dear self; Regard thy precious health, as the possession That I enjoin thee to preserve and cherish. Lady Russel. Thou guide and guardian of thy Rachel's life! Though the dark grave must hide thee from my eyes, Thy gentleness, thy love, thy truth, thy virtues, Will still, like faithful and protecting spirits, Be ever present to my thought, and give My grief-dejected mind new power to rear The little idols of my widow'd heart. Russel. They will have all, that youth requires, in thee; The gentle friend, the fond, yet firm director, Whose steady kindness, and rever'd perfection, Makes discipline delight: their minds from thine May copy all the virtues; chiefly two, Of prime distinction, Truth and Fortitude, The pillars of all human excellence!â I bless thee now for many years of fondness; But most for that sublimity of love, Which has disdain'd to make my fate more bitter By abject vain complaints and weak'ning tears. Lady Russel. Refrain, I pray you, from this tender praise; It will o'erthrow the firmness you commend, And 'waken all the woman in my bosom. Russel. Dear Rachel! as my boy approaches manhood, Teach him to look upon his father's death. Rather as noble than unfortunate! Tell him, that, dying by no just decree, I deem'd it still a happiness that Heaven Made me a native of this generous isle, Which, though now darken'd by a transient cloud, Is doom'd, I trust, to be the radiant throne Of settled Liberty and stedfast Faith; Early infuse into his youthful spirit, As the sure ground-work of all manly virtue, A sense of civil and religious freedom; Give to his pliant mind true English temper, Teach him to fear no Being but his God, And to love nothing earthly more than England. Enter an Attendant. Attendant. My Lord, the officers! Russel. They shall not wait. Lady Russel. Inhuman haste!âDo thou, great God! proportion The patience of thy servants in distress To the infernal malice of their foes! Since thy unquestionable will permits Such innocence to perish on the scaffold, Send the most soothing of thy heavenly spirits To wait unseen upon the dying martyr! Take from this hideous form of Violent Death His horrible attendants, Pain and Anguish! Russel. O my kind Love! that quick undreaded stroke, So soon to sever this frail mortal frame, Is but a feather's printless touch, compar'd To this my deepest wound, which now I feel In tearing thus my faithful heart from thine! Each moment that we linger but increases Our mutual pangs; then take in this embrace My latest benediction! Lady Russel. O, farewell! Russel. Yet a last kiss!âand for our little ones, Bear thou to each this legacy of love! Now we must part!âFarewell! Lady Russel. Farewell for ever! [Exit Lady Russel. Russel. Spencer! the bitterness of death is past, And thou hast nothing more to fear for Russel! Then quit him, thou kind friend, and be thy care Devoted to the precious charge he leaves: I pray attend that dear unhappy mourner; Place her within my gentle sister's arms, And sooth their mutual sorrow!âTell my father, I should have wish'd to clasp his hand once more, But that I fear'd to shock his feeble age. Spencer. Grief, my dear Lord, denies me utterance Of all that I would say!âFarewell! my tears And prompt obedience will, I trust, to you, Though mute interpreters, explain my heart. Russel. Yet stop!âThy Russel has now done with time, That heavy load to foolish Indolence, But active Probity's prolific treasure! Take then this small memorial of esteem, This little index of the passing hours; For thou hast wisdom to improve their value, And I am entering on eternity. [Giving his watch to Spencer. Stay not for thanks! follow thy weeping charge; Hasten to her support; and Heaven reward thee! [Exit Spencer. Russel (kneeling.) Thou only perfect and unfailing Source Of all serenity, all strength, all power, In thy frail suppliant man! thou gracious God! I bless thy mercy, which in bitterest anguish Has fortified my soul, and now dispels All fearful hurry from my even thoughts! O comfort thou those kind and tender beings, To whom my death must prove a lasting wound! Grant me to pass my little residue Of closing life with chearful constancy, And take my willing spirit to thy bosom! Enter Cavendish. Cavendish. Allow me, thou blest martyr! once again To press thy hand, to bathe it with my tears, And, in this agony of greedy sorrow, Catch from thy lips the last command of friendship! Russel. My faithful Cavendish! I have but one, One wish to utter that relates to earth; And to thy truth I trust for its completion: Dying, I charge thee, by the love thou bearest To Russel's honor and our country's welfare, Quell, in the hearts of all who may lament me, The frantic passion to revenge my death! Wilt thou be mindful of this last injunction? Cavendish. If I neglect one dictate of thy virtue, May Heaven, to punish me, take from my soul The dear remembrance of our amity! Russel. 'Tis well:âthy promise ends my only fear. Farewell, my gallant, generous bosom-friend! Farewell!âstill think me living in my children, Still in their little frames embrace thy Russel! [Russel departs, but after a short pause returns. Russel. One thing there is that yet I wish to say. Cavendish. O speak! for every accent of thy voice Pierces my breast, and all thy words shall live Graven as laws on my retentive heart! Russel. Friend of my youth, I have for many years Held a prime place within thy noble bosom, And studied all its rich and rare perfections, The radiant virtues in fair order marshall'd Beneath the guidance of presiding honor: I've seen thee full of high and glorious thoughts Towards this world; but pardon if I say, That thy brave mind, to me, has seem'd to fail In homage to the sovereignty of Heaven. Cavendish. Thou godlike monitor! in such a moment To feel for my offences! Russel. Do not wonder At the calm temper of thy dying friend; Use thy own spotless and exalted spirit To commune more with Heaven, and thou wilt find The blessed habit of considering That we are acting in our Maker's eye, Arms the unshrinking soul for every scene. Weigh well the powers of simple piety, Make it the key-stone in thy arch of virtue, And it will keep that graceful fabric firm, Though all the storms of fortune burst upon it. Yet farther would I press this counsel to thee, But time forbids meâOnce again, farewell! Long be thy life, and crown'd with every blessing, Till in its peaceful close we meet in heaven. [Exit. Cavendish. Smiling he's gone to triumph o'er Oppression By brave endurance! while my voice, suspended By anguish, love, and wonder, wanted power To breathe one last adieu!âWhile yet he lives, I cannot bear to be divided from him: No, I will followâI will fondly gaze On the dear model of consummate virtue E'en to his latest moment; I will see His heavenly patience meet the murd'rous axe; I will behold his death, though in the sight My tortur'd eyestrings burst with agony. [Exit. Enter York with an Officer. York. At length I have prevail'd!âthe traitor dies, Spite of the weakness in my wavering brother. This is indeed an hour of exultation! To all the friends of our true ancient faith This public fall of her arch enemy Is a sure omen that she soon will rise In all her gorgeous pomp of older time, And from the turbulence of heresy Clear this recover'd isle. Officer. Her fairest hope Lives in the spirit of your Highness zeal. York. Yet this insidious Russel is so dear To the deluded vulgar, I still dreadâ A struggle for his rescue!âSay, my friend, Hast thou arrang'd our private partizans At proper intervals to guard the scaffold, And keep the gaping multitude in awe, Those resty knaves, who, in this factious land, Are ever ready to engage in riot, And hazard life for every bold impostor, Or subtle demagogue who raves on freedom? Officer. Fear not, my Lord! the voice of loud Sedition Will hardly dare to breathe a single murmur Upon her idol's fall. York. And hast thou settled A clear succession of immediate signals, Which may, as Russel drops, transport to me A quick assurance that his head is off? Officer. Your Highness, in the minute of its fall, Will be appriz'd 'tis fallen by the sound Of fifes now station'd in this armoury. York. 'Tis well; my trusty friend, I thank thy care: I cannot rest till I am satisfied The heretic has lost all power to hurt us. Bedford (entering in extreme haste.) Yet pardon, yet preserve him, princely York! I know thy word is able to suspend The lifted axe. York. Away, thou weak old man! Bedford. Spurn not my prayer! its object is thy peace Not less than mine:âby all thy trembling hopes Of future greatness and secure dominion, Haste thou to snatch him from impending fate! If, in these moments of extreme despair, Thy pity saves my son, thou wilt appear As the bright delegate of heavenly mercy! [The fifes sound. York. Away! the sound thou hearest is a signal That the just rigor of the law has fallen Upon his finish'd life. Bedford. O my lost child!â But he is happy in the fellowship Of saints, who to his higher purity Pay blessed homageâhis deliver'd spirit Gives a new impulse to my lifeless heart: His sufferings all are ended; but this hour, Which sees them close, for thee, relentless York! Beholds a train of dark calamities, The spreading offspring of thy cruelty, Rise into being! York. Go, retire, old man, And heal thy shatter'd mind: I have not leisure To hear the ravings of distracted age. [Exit York, with the Officer. Bedford. 'Tis not the frenzy of a weak old man That now proclaims thy fate, inhuman bigot, Rushing through guiltless blood to thy destruction! It is the spirit of my angel son! He for a moment leaves the heavenly choir, (Whose ready harps shall usher him to glory) To drown a father's anguish in this vision Of soul-possessing prescience!âyes, 'tis he Who now presents to my astonish'd eye These crowding images!âI see thee now, Insatiate York! invested with that crown For which thy barbarous ambition panted; I see it fall from thy unkingly head, Shaking with fear's vile palsy!âin thy terror I see thee sue, imperious, abject spirit! To the insulted Bedford, but in vain. Thy power, that highest trust of Heaven, abus'd, Passes from thee! The cruel blood-stain'd tyrant Wanders a wretched exile! This wrong'd island Emerges from the darkness of Oppression!â Hail, scenes of triumph to all English hearts! Hail, thou bright festival of settled Freedom! I see and bless thy firm establishment. And hark! the justice of a patriot king, Uniting with a grateful nation's voice, Turns the base sentence of my murder'd Russel To a fair record of soul-soothing honor, And hails me glorious in my matchless son! Enter Cavendish. Cavendish. 'Tis past, my Lord! I have beheld him seal A life of virtue with a death of glory! Bedford. And thou canst tell me, dying, he appear'd, E'en as he liv'd, a model to mankind! Cavendish. Never did martyr with more lovely grace Part from a world unworthy to possess him! To the surrounding crowd he mildly spoke A few short words of pardon to his foes, With fervent benediction to his country; Commending to the hearts of all who heard him, A love of peace and purified religion; Then with a chearful readiness invited The stroke of death! I saw the unhappy man, Who with a trembling arm lifted the axe O'er his unshaken victim, in his tremor Measuring the neck to strike his even blow; I saw him raze the skin! and in that moment The cheek of Russel held its native hue Unblanc'd with fear!âit was a sight to turn The grief of friendship to idolatry! And your paternal sorrow into pride! Bedford. Dear Cavendish! I will not wound his spirit, His gallant spirit, by unmanly mourning: No, I have pride, such pride as Heaven approves; Nor would I now exchange my murder'd Russel For any living son in Christendom! Cavendish. Bless this fond firmness of the English father! It penetrates and chears my aching heart.â Come, my dear Lord, let us retire from hence, To soothe yet fonder sorrow, weeping now In scenes which he has hallow'd by his care, In his past days of social happiness: There let us sit, and still with sad delight Talk o'er his numerous virtues: they shall be The theme of every tongue! and, ages hence, Still fix the love of every English spirit! Then, if the voice of Learning would compare What rich Antiquity and Modern Time Have seen of public virtue, while the hand Of Glory justly in her balance throws The gather'd worthies of the Pagan world, England shall boast her own superior wealth, And poise the rival scale with Russel's name!</field>
