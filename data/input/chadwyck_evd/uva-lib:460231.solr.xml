      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENEâA Palace Yard. Enter Doodle and Noodle Meeting, they Embrace. DUET, Doodle. Sure such a day, So renown'd, so victoriousâ Such a day as this was never seen; Courtiers so gay, And the mob so uproriousâ Nature seems to wear an universal grin. Noodle. Arthur to Doll Is grown bobbish and uxorious; While both she and Huncamunca tipple, talking tawdry, Even Mr. Sol, So tifted out, so glorious, Glitters like a beau in a new birth-day embroidery. Doodle. Oh, 'tis a day Of jubilee, cajollery; A day we never saw before; A day of sun and drollery. Noodle. That you may say, Their Majesties may boast of it; And since it never can come more, 'Tis fit they make the most of it, Doodle. Oh, 'tis a day, &amp;c. Noodle. That you may say, Doodle. Sure such a day, &amp;c. Noodle. Courtiers so gay, &amp;c. Dood. Yes, Noodle, yes;âto-day the mighty Thumb Returns triumphant.âCaptive Giants swarm Like bees behind his car. (Flourish. Nood. But hark! These trumpets Speak the King at leveeâI go. Dood. And I also. SCENE.âA Palace. Enter KING, QUEEN, Lord GRIZZLE, Courtiers and Attendants. âDOODLE and NOODLE apart. King. Let no face but a face of joy be seen! The man who this day frowns, shall lose his head, That he may have no face to frown withallâ Smile Dollalolla! Dood. (Keeling.) Dread Liege This Petitionâ King. (Dashes it away.) Petition me no petitions, Sir, to-day; To-day it is our pleasure to be drunk, And this our Queen shall be as drunk as we. Queen. I'st so? why then perdition catch the sailers. Let's have a rouse, and get as drunk as tailors. AIR. Queen. What tho' I now am half seas o'er, I scorn to baulk this bout, Of stiff rack punch fetch Bowls a score, 'Fore George I'll see them out. 'Fore George, &amp;c. But, Sir, your Queen 'twould ill become, T'indulge in vulgar sips; No drop of brandy, gin, or rum, Should pass these royal lips. Shall pass, &amp;c. King. Tho' rack in punch, ten shillings were a quart, And rum and brandy be but half a crown, Rather than quarrel thou shalt have thy fill. (Trumpets.) Nood. These martial sounds, my liege, announce the general. King. Haste we to meet, and meetly to receive him. (Martial Music.) Enter Tom Thumb, Attendants, and Glumdalca in Chains. Welcome, thrice welcome, mighty Thomas Thumb! Thou tiny heroâpigmy giant queller! What gratitude can thank away the debt Thy valour puts upon us. (Sets him down.) Queen. Oh! ye Gods!(Aside.) Tom. When I'm not thank'd at all, I'm thank'd enoughâ I've done my duty, and I've done no more. (Bows.) Queen. Was ever such a God-like creature seen? King. Thy modesty's a flambeau to thy merit. It shines itself, and shews thy merit tooâ O Tom! what to thy prowess do we owe! Ask some reward,âgreat as we can bestow. Tom. I ask not kingdoms, I can conquer those; I ask not money,âmoney I've enough: If this be call'd a debt, take my receipt in full. I ask but this, to sun myself in Huncamunca's eyes. King. (Aside.) Prodigious bold request! Queen. Be still my soul!â King. (After a pause.) It is resolved! The princess is thy own. (To Thumb.) Tom. O happy Tommy! Super happy Thumb! Whisper, ye winds, that Huncamunca's mine! The bloody business of grim war is o'er. And beauty, heavenly beauty crowns my toils. AIR. Tom. As when the chimney sweeper, Has all the live long day, Thro' darksome paths a creeper, Pursu'd his sooty way: At night to wash with water His hands and face he flies; And in his t'other tatter, With his Brickdusta lies. King. (Looking fondly at Glumdalca.) I feel a sudden pain across my breastâ(Aside.) Nor know I whether it proceeds from love Or the wind cholicâHugeous Queen of Hearts, Sure thou wert form'd by all the Gods in council; Who having made a lucky hit, beyond their journey work Cry'd out âThis is a woman!â Glum. Then were the Gods consoundedly mistaken, We are a giantessâI tell thee Arthur, We, yesterday were both a queen and wife; One hundred thousand giants own'd our sway. Twenty whereof were wedded to ourself. Queen. Oh blest prerogative of giantism! (Aside.) King. Be cheer'd, vast Princess.âThink our court thine own, Call for whate'er thou likestâthere's nought to pay. Nor art thou captive, but thy captive we. (Takes off her chain.) Queen. (Aside.) Ha! Arthur faithless This gag my rival too, in dear Tom Thumb! Revenge!âbut I'll dissembleâ Madam, believe that with a woman's eye I view your lossâtake comfortâfor to morrow, Our grenadiers shall be call'd out, then chuse As many husbands as you think you'll want. Glum. Madam, I rest your much obliged servant. [Exit. Queen. Tho' greater yet Tom's boasted merit was, He shall not have my daughter, that is pos. (Advancing to the King.) King. Ha! say'st thou? Queen. Yes, I say he sha'nt. King. How, shan't! Now by our royal self, we swear he shall. AIR, Queen. Then tremble all, who weddings ever made, And tremble more who did this match persuade; For like a worried cat, I'll spit, I'll squall, I'll scratch, I'll tear the eyes out of ye all. [Exit Queen and Ladies. Dood. Her majesty the Queen is in a passion. King. Be she, or be she not, who cares? We were indeed; A pretty king of clouts were we to truckle To all her maudlin humours. AIR. King. We Kings, who are in our senses, Mock our consorts violences; Pishing at their moods and tenses, Our own will we follow. When the husband once gives way To his wife's capricious sway, For his breeches he next day May go whoop and hollow. [Exeunt Gents. &amp;c. SCENE changes. Enter Grizzle. (moody.) Griz. âArthur wrongs me! Cheats me of my Huncamunca! Rouse thee, Grizzle! 'Sblood, I'll be a rebel. Alas, what art thou, glory? A Monmouth-street lac'd coat, gracing to-day My back; to-morrow glittering on another'sâ To arms! to arms! Enter the Queen (in a rage.) Queen. Teach me to scold, O Grizzle! Griz. Scold wou'd my Queen?âsay, wherefore. Queen. Wherefore! Faggots and fireâmy daughter to Tom Thumb! Griz. I'll mince the Atom into countless pieces? Queen. Oh! no, prevent the match, but hurt not himâ Him!âThou!âThou kill the man Who kill'd the Giants? Griz. Giants!âWhy Madam, 'tis all flummery, He made the Giants first, and then he kill'd them. Queen. How! hast thou seen no giants? are there not Now in our yard, ten thousand proper giants? Griz. Madam, I cannot positively tell, But firmly do believe there is not one. Queen. Out from my sight, base Pickthank, hie, begone! By all my stars, thou enviest Tom Thumb. DUET. Queen and Grizzle. Queen. Liar avaunt, Thy saucy taunt, In proof of Tom's desert; He will break That scurvy neck, If on him thou dar'st fling dirt. Grizzle. Yes, yes, I go, But, Madam, know, (Since your Majesty's so pert) That a flood Of Tommy's blood, To allay this storm shall spirt. Queen. Go to hell! Grizzle. Oh, mighty well. Queen. Thither hie to feed the blaze. Griz. I'm glad I know your ways. Queen. My sweet creature, To bespatter, Quick or dead I'll ne'er forgive. Grizzle. 'Tis my nature, Not to flatter, Take my word, he shall not live. Queen. I'll ne'er forgive. Grizzle. He shall not live. [Exeunt. SCENE.âAn Anti-Chamber. The King discovered on a Couch. King. âMethought I heard a voice say, âSleep no more!â Glumdalca exiles sleepsâAnd therefore, Arthur Can sleep no more. Ghost of Gaffer Thumb Rises. Ghost. Oh, Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Soon shalt thou sleep enough. King. Ah! what art thou? Ghost. The Ghost of Gaffer Thumb. King. A Ghost!âStand off! I'll have thee laid in the Red-Sea. Ghost. Oh Arthur! take heed. My thread is spunâlist, list, Oh list! AIR. Ghost. Pale death is prowling, Dire omens scowling, Doom thee to slaughter, Thee, thy wife and daughter, Furies are growling, With horrid groans: Grizzle's rebellion, What need I tell you on? Or by a red cow, Tom Thumb devoured? Hark! the cock crowing. I must be going, I can no more. [Vanishes. King. No more! And why no more, or why so much? Better quite ignorant, than half instructed. By Jove, this Bo-peep Ghost makes game of us, Therefore, Fate, keep your secret to yourself. AIR King. Such a fine King as I, don't fear your threats of a rush, Do shew your sweet phiz again, and I'll quickly call up a blush, For I am up, up, up, But you are down, down, down, Do pop up your nob again, And egad I'll crack your crown. Who cares for you, Mr. Ghost? Or all that you can do; I laugh at your stupid threats, And your cock-a-doodle-do; For I am up, up, up, But you are down, down, down, Draw your sword like a man, Or, I'll box you for a crown. [Exit. SCENEâHuncamunca's Dressing-Room. Huncamunca discovered at her ToiletteâFrizaletta waiting. Hunc. Give me some music,âsee that it be sad. [Band plays a strain of Death and the Lady.] Oh Tommy Thumb! why art thou Tommy Thumb? Why had not mighty Bantam been thy father? Why not the King of Brentford, old or new? Friz. Madam, Lord Grizzle. Enter Lord Grizzle. Griz. (Kneeling.) Oh, Huncamunca! Huncamunca, oh! Hunc. This to my rank,âbold man! Griz. Ah, beauteous Princess! Love levels rank,âlords down to cellar bears, And bids the brawny porter walk up stairs.â Nought is for love too high, nor ought too lowâ Oh, Huncamunca! Huncamunca, oh! Hunc. My Lord, in vain, a-suitoring you come, For I'm engaged this instant to Tom Thumb. Griz. Play not the fool, that less than baby shun, Or you will ne'er be brought to bed of one. Hunc. Am I thus fobb'd?âThen I my words recall. Griz. Shall I to Doctor's commons? Hunc. Do so prayâ I now am in the mood, and cannot stay. AIR. Grizzle. In hurry post for a licence, In hurry ding dong I come back; For that you shan't need bid me twice hence, I'll be there, and here in a crack. Hey ting, My heart's on the wing, I now could leap over the moon; Let the Chaplain Set us grapp'ling, And we'll stock a baby-house soon. [Exit. Enter Tom Thumb. Tom. Where is my Huncamunca? where's my Princess? Where those bright eyes, the car-matches of Cupid, That light up all with love my waxen soul? Hunc. Put out the light, nor waste thy little taper. Tom. Put out the light? Impossible! As well Sir Solomon might put out his rushlight. (Sings.) Hunc. I am to Lord Grizzle promis'd. Tom. Promis'd? Hunc. Too sure, 'tis enter'd in fate's journal. Tom. Enter'd! Rounds! I'll tear out the leafâI'll blot the pageâI'll burn the book. I tell thee, Princess, had I been thy help-mate, We soon had peopled this whole realm with Thumbs. Hunc. O fie! I shudder at the gross idea! AIR. Huncamunca. 'Tis not in sinew, or in bone, That conquering power resides alone; A fig for size. We often find In smallest forms the largest mind. So lovely Tommy, mighty man, Although his frame is small, Can fight as well as giants can; The spirit serves for all. His manly heart and nimble arm, Subdue both stout and tall; His love and war alternate charm, The heart is all in all. Tom. Then go we to the Kingâlet him decide, Whether you shall be Grizzle's, or my bride. AIR. Tom. That pettisogging Grizzle, I find, is your gallant, Who, like a hedge-attorney, cogs my title to supplant; Shall he with you join issue?âNo, by my soul, he shan't. For Tommy is the lad, the lad for thee, &amp;c. (Going out Hand-in-hand, are met by Glumdalca.) Glum. Stop, Brandy-nose! hopest thou the wight, Who once hath worn my easy chains, will toil in thine? Hunc. Easy, no doubt, by twenty husbands worn. Tom. In the balcony which o'erhang the stage, I've seen one wench two 'prentices engage: This half-a-crown doth in his fingers hold, That just lets peep a little bit of gold. Miss the half-guinea wisely does purloin, And scorns the bigger, and the baser coin. TRIO. Glumdalca. Oh! the vixen pigmy brat, Of inches scarce half six; To slight me for a chit like that, Ah! Mr. Tom, are these your tricks? Huncamunca. Oh! the coarse salacious trull, Who giant paramours twice ten To bed can pull, With hugs can lull, Yet still would gull Young gentlemen. Tom Thumb. Little tho' I be, I scorn the sturdy strum; Nor ever she, My dear from thee Shall debauch thy own Tom Thumb. Glumdalca. Oh the vixen, &amp;c. Huncamunca. Oh the coarse, &amp;c. Tom Thumb. Little tho' I be, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DUET, Doodle. Sure such a day, So renown'd, so victoriousâ Such a day as this was never seen; Courtiers so gay, And the mob so uproriousâ Nature seems to wear an universal grin. Noodle. Arthur to Doll Is grown bobbish and uxorious; While both she and Huncamunca tipple, talking tawdry, Even Mr. Sol, So tifted out, so glorious, Glitters like a beau in a new birth-day embroidery. Doodle. Oh, 'tis a day Of jubilee, cajollery; A day we never saw before; A day of sun and drollery. Noodle. That you may say, Their Majesties may boast of it; And since it never can come more, 'Tis fit they make the most of it, Doodle. Oh, 'tis a day, &amp;c. Noodle. That you may say, Doodle. Sure such a day, &amp;c. Noodle. Courtiers so gay, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENEâThe Court of the Palace. Enter NOODLE. Noodle. Sure Nature means t'unhinge the solid Globe! Chaos is come againâAll's topsy turvy. AIR. King Arthur in love ankle deepâspeed the plough, Glumdalca will soon be his punk-a, Good Queen Dollalolla's as drunk as a sow, And a bed with Tom Thumb, Huncamunca. Enter GRIZZLE hastily. Griz. If this be true, all women kind are damn'd. Nood. If it be not, may I be damn'd myself. [Exit. Griz. Then, get out, patience! Oh, I'm whirlwind all; Havock, let loose the Dogs of war, Halloo! SONG. Long I will not wear the willow, Long I will not hug my pillow; In my breast a storm is brewing, Which shall spread fire, sword, and ruin O'er these desolate coasts: This proud Arthur down shall knuckle, Dollalolla too shall truckle; Huncamunca shall knock under; Her I'll ravishâthen I'll plunder; In fierce battle I will rattle, Sinking, damning, Slashing, cramming Every chink of Hell with ghosts. [Exit. SCENEâA Chamber in the Palace. Enter QUEEN. Queen. Ah, wherefore from his Dollalolla's arms Doth Arthur steal? Why all alone; And in the dark, leave her, whose feeble nerves He knows, are harrow'd up with fears of spirits. Air. QUEEN. In bed, when women lie awake, (We wives can't always sleep) At every little noise we hear, And closer, closer creep; But cuddled warm In love's dear arms, Let thunder rock the house. We feel no frights, We matter sprights Not three skips of a louse. Enter KING. King. We hoped the fumes, sweet Queen, of last night's punch Had glued thy lovely eyes; but ah, we find There is no power in drams to quiet wives. Enter NOODLE. Nood. Long life to both your Majesties,âif life Be worth a figâLord Grizzle at the head Of a rebellious rout, invests the palace; He swearsâunless the Princess straight Be yielded up, with Tom Thumb's pate, About your ears he will beat down the gate. King. The devil he will!âBut see the Princess! Enter HUNCAMUNCA. Say, where's the mighty Thumb, our Sword and Buckler? Tho' 'gainst us men and giants league with gods, Yet Thumb alone, is equal to more odds. Hunca. About an hour and half ago Tom sallied forth to meet the foe, And soon who's who, he'll make them know. King. Come, Dollalolla. Huncamunca, come; Within we'll wait in whole skins for Tom Thumb. [Exeunt. SCENE.âA Plain. Enter GRIZZLE, NOODLE, and Rebels. (A March.) Griz. Thus far with victory your arms are crown'd For tho' we have not fought, yet have we sound No enemy to fight withal. (Trumpets.) Enter THUMB, DOODLE, and SOLDIERS. (Trumpets.) Tom. Art thou the man, whom men fam'd Grizzle call? Griz. Art thou the much more fam'd Tom Thumb the small? Tom. The same Griz. The same Tom. His prowess now each prove Griz. For Liberty I stand Tom. And I for love. (A bloody Engagement between the two ArmiesâThey fight off.) Enter GLUMDALCA, and GRIZZLE, meeting. Glum. Turn, Coward, turn! Nor from a woman fly! Griz. Thou art unworthy of my arm. Glum. Am I? Have at thy heart then? (Thursts at, but misses him.) Griz. Rampant queen of sluts Now have at thine. (Strikes.) Glum. (Falling) You've run me thro' the guts. Griz. Then there's an end of one. (going.) (Is met by Tom Thumb, who cuts him down.) Tom. An end of two Thou hast it. Griz. Oh Tom Thumb! thy soul be-shrew! I dieâAmbition! The lates have made their Tour, And the Black Cart is waiting at the door. AIR. Grizzle. My body is a bankrupt's shop, My cruel Creditor, grim death; Who puts to life's brisk trade a stop, And will be paid with my last breathâ Oh! Oh! Oh! [Dies: Tom. Bear off the carcasses; lop off his knob 'Twill witness to the King, Tom Thumb's good job; Rebellion's dead, and nowâI'll go to breakfast. (Exit.) SCENE.âThe Presence Chamber. Enter KING, QUEEN, HUNCAMUNCA, DOODLE, PLUMANTE, FRIZALETTA, and Attendants. King. Open the prisons, set the wretched free! And bid our Treasurer disburse five guineas To pay their debts.âLet our Arch-Necromancer, Sage Merlin, straight attend usâwe the while Will view the triumph of our Son-in-law. Hunca. Take note Sir, that on this our wedding day; Two victories, hath my gallant husband won. Enter NOODLE. Nood. Oh, monstrous, dreadful, terrible! Oh! oh! King. What means the blockhead? Nood. But to grace my tale with decent horror Tom Thumb is no more. A huge red Cowâjust nowâi'th'open street Before my eyes, devoured the great Tom Thumb. (A general groan.) King. Shut,âshut again the prisons Let our Treasurer Not issue out three farthings. Hang all the culprits And bid the School-masters whip all their boys. Nood. Her majesty the Queen is in a swoon. Queen. Not so much in a swoon, but to have still Strength to reward the Messenger of ill. (Queen kills Noodle.) Friz. My lover kill'dâ His death I thus revenge. (Kills the Queen.) Hunca. Kill my Mamma! O base Assassin! there! (Kills Frizalletta.) Dood. For that, take this. (Kills Hunca.) Plum. And thou take that. (Kills Doodle.) King. Die, murderess vile! Death makes a feast to day And but reserves ourself for his bon bouche. So when the boy, whom nurse from danger guards Sends Jack for mustard with a pack of Cards; Kings, Queens and knaves, tip one another down, 'Till the whole pack lie scatter'd and o'erthrown? Thus all our pack upon the floor is cast, And my sole boast is, that I fall the last. (Stabs himself.) Merlin Rises.âThunder and Lightining. Merlin. Blood, what a scene of slaughter's here! But I'll soon shift it, never fear. Gallants, behold! I one touch of Merlin's magic, Shall to gay comic, change this dismal tragic. (Wave his wand.âThunder and Lightning.) First at my word, thou horned Cannibal, Return again our England's Hannibal. (Thunder.) (Thumb comes out of the Cow's Mouth, and starts fiercely.) Next to your King, Queen, Lords and Commons, I issue my Hell-bilking Summons. AIR. Merlin. INCANTATION. Arise ye groups of drunken sots! Who deal out deaths, you know not why; No more of porter pots, or plots, Your senseless jealousy lay by. Your souls cannot as yet be far Upon their way to dreary Night. My power remands them. Enter GLUMDALCA and GRIZZLE. âHere ends jar, Live, love, and all this will be right. (The dead all start up.) (Vaudville.) King. (To the Queen.) One kind buss, my Dolly Queen; When we two last parted We scarce hoped to buss again; My heart! Lord, how it smarted! Queen. (To the King.) Dear King Atty, pitty patty, Mine too went a fleeting; Now we in a Nipperkin, May toast this merry meeting. Tom. (To Hunc.) Come my Hunkyâcome my Pet, Love's in haste, don't stay him; Deep we are in Hymen's debt, And 'tis high time we pay him. Hunc. (To Tom.) Have dear Tommy Pity on me; I'm by shame restricted! Yet I obey, So take your way, I must not contradict it. Griz. (To Glum.) Grandest Glum in my behoof. To love's law be pliant; Me you'll find a man of proof. Altho' not quite a Giant. Glum. (To Griz.) Indeed, Lord Griz, Tho' for that phiz, Few amorous Queens would chuse you Yet thus bereft, Not one chum left, I think I can't refuse you. Merlin. Now love and live, and live and love. All. Sage Merlin's in the right on't; Merlin. Each couple prove like hand in glove; All. Agreed. Queen. 'Fore George we'll make a night on't. All. Let Discord cease, Let all in peace Go home and kiss their spouses; Join hat and cap In one loud clap, And with us crowded houses. FINIS.</field>
