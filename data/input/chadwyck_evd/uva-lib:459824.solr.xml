      <field name="fulltext">The Persons Represented, and their Habits. Philostrates, Love's Soveraign Pontif, and Governour of Cypres: in Pontificial Ornaments, a Tyara on his head, &amp;c. Euphanes, a Noble Cypriot loving Bellinda, and beloved by Philena: like your antient Heroes in Military array, a Javelin in his hand. Philander, a Stranger, and Bellinda's betroth'd: habited at all parts like Euphanes, but girt with a Scimiter, &amp;c. Polydor, one of Love's Ministers, and Confident of Euphanes: in Roba longa of Taffata unto the knee, white Buskins, crown'd with Mirtle, or Roses, &amp;c. Pamphilus a Cockscomb, Stranger to the Customs of Love's Dominions: in Ridiculous Fantastique Equipage. Mysti and Chorus: like the antient Egyptian Priests, in long Robes, crown'd with Roses or Mirtles, Buskins, &amp;c. Philena, a Noble Nymph of Cypres, hospitably entertaining Bellinda, and loving Euphanes: in long Taffata robes to the mid-legg, with a Tynsel mantle of different colour, fastned on the one shoulder, and hanging down under the other arm, silver'd Buskins with falls of white Tynsel on either side; her hair curled, wreathed, or pleyted, with a Coronet of Roses or Mirtle, white gloves, a collar of Pearl about her neck, &amp;c. Bellinda, a Noble Nymph, cast on shore in Cypres by strange Accident: habited at all parts like Philena, their colours only different. Flamette, a facetious Nymph of Cypres, and Confident of Philena: more simply and matronly habited than the rest. Masquers. Prologue. Hope In green Garments. Fear In pale Ash-colour. Joy In white. Fruition In Sky-colour. Lover, and his Mistresse, All properly habited for the Dance Guards, Executioner, Grex of Youths and Virgins, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first Act. The Scene, a Boscage, with the adjacent Prospect of a delightfull Valley, here and there Inhabited, with a magnificent Temple afar off discovered. Scene I. A Chorus of Love's Priests with Asperges and Thuribles lustrating the place. 1 Mysti. We with pure Conspersions thus, Sacred rites, and hallowed Thus, To render every Lover true, Do Element Love's dominions new; That no heart too strongly beat, We give his Fires temperate heat; We give his Waters vertuous force, T'asswage 'um taken in their source; Fogg of perjur'd Vows and Oaths, Which fair Truth, and Candor loaths, We purge the Air from, and the Earth From every fowl and monstrous birth; For, as some Lands their Monsters fear, Unruly Lust's our Monster here; As others poys'nous Beasts molest, So Avarice is our poys'nous Beast, From which, when once a Realm is freed, Then Love's dominion 'tis indeed. SCENE II. Euphanes in desperate Action of throwing himself on his Iavelin, withheld by Polydor. Pol. You wo'n't be mad? Eup. I will be nothing but For Love, and for Love I will be any thing. Pray unhand meâshall Bellinda, the Divine Bellinda, who is to Beauty what Beauty is to others, all Grace and Ornament, Shall she be banish'd hence to day? and shall Euphanes live to see't? Pol. And shall Euphanes, The gallant, and the brave Euphanes die Only to prevent death? how low And poorly wou'd it shew?âand that's the worst That can come on't,âbut I hope better still; Venus, the Goddess of this Isle, has oft Done greater miracles than this, to make one young, And fair, to love. Eup. âWho has onely miracles âFor Hopes, has Hopes but nigh Despair. Pol. Yet Time's A mighty Qualifier of Fortune's harms, And he who headlong throws himself into Despair, precipitates his life, whilst he Circumvents death, who lets himself down into 't by degrees;âBut pray consider, has she not promis'd you, If any in Cypres she loves, it shall be you? and Is this no hope? No comfort? Eup. Just as much As 'mong the numerous and unhappy throng Of excluded Lovers, to stand next the door, First expos'd t'affronts, and most concern'd In the disgrace. Pol. Nay, if you give your self Despair, there's none can give you Hope; at worst If Euphanes loves Bellinda, as he says, What hinders him following her whersoe'r she goes? âBootlesly and idlely does he complain âOf Winter, who but following of the Sun âMight still enjoy the Spring. Eup. But following an Eclipsed Sun, what should he gain by it, But only dark and dismal visions to His Eys, and to his Heart black Melancholy thoughts? Pol. Well Euphanes, as the Experient prove, There are strange turns, strange mysteries in Love, Who oft (as by experience we find) Changes the most obstinate, obdurate mind: For know, the Temple of Love is not compos'd, As by th'grots ignorant vulgar 'tis suppos'd, O'th' dull materials, Of dead senseless stones, But he has more sensible and living ones, The hearts of every one which he do's fit, And apt at pleasure for composing it, Of which some Nature makes so fit to love, They with small difficulty Lovers prove: Others so stuborn and unapt again, They love not, but with mighty toil and pain; And those who finally so useless prove Th'are wholy unfit for th'fabrique of Love, As in Bellinda, ('t may be) you'll see to day, Offended Love do's cast 'um quite awayâ But far be th'omen from my words, for though 't be more yet to be wish'd than hop'd, it is Impossible she should not feel Love who Do's make so many feel it, nor have no fire In her herself, who kindles it in so many breastsâ But see Philona here makes me behold you as A thing of pity. Go haplesse youth, and sacrifise to Love, Whose Deity you must have highly offended sure Inflicts on you so heavy punishment, To love one who neglects you, and neglect Her here so dearly loves you: Eup. Stay, you will Not go I hope? Pol. Excuse me, i'th quarrels of Lovers 'tis dangerous interposing. Eup. I'll warrant you. Love shoots not his darts so fast and vehemently From either of our encountring eys You need fear being shot. Pol. How ever I'll not trust you, For in these pretty skirmishes None knows When you are friends or foes: For now ther's falling out, Now truce, Now war, And then Amity and peace agen. So if you be foes, I'll not hinder your making friends; If friends, Love keep you so. SCENE III. Philena, Euphanes. Eup. Now shall I Be vext even to madnesse with her importunity, Lest truly I prevent her, and with one importunity Expell anotherâPhilena happily met, For in you I meet my wishes. Phi. Most happy I, if my hopes now don't delude And flatter me into deceit. [aside] Eup. Thou know'st my life So much depends on th'Fortune of this day, As should Bellinda part hence, I of Necessity must part with Life and all, Whose Love the Fates have with so strong a Tye Fastn'd to my very heart strings, they cannot snatch Her hence, but they must rend and tear my heart Out of my bosom tooâGo prethee, go then, And in this last moment when the Fates are busiest At work in finishing their design, Indear Thy diligence, and redeem thy Tardiness. âTime is a Treasure few or none do care âTo save till 't's almost lostâ Thou knowst those softer minutes when Nymphs minds Are best dispos'd for the Impressions of Love: Couldst thou but instamp me in her bosom then, And glide a thought of me into her memory, Iust as she passes to the Temple, thou shouldst infinitely Oblige Euphanes, and make him ever happy. Phi. And my self ever unhappy by't, ah me! Was ever any more miserable than I [aside] To be made confident of my Rivals Love Against my self? Eup. What should I say more? tell her How much I love her,âyet that is not enough, How much I Reverence &amp; Adore her, do'st thou hear? Phi. I do;â&amp; will you hear me now? Eup. If th'hast any thing new to say I will; But of old businesses I pray no more. Phi. That cann't be old that's every day renew'd. Eup. Rather that cann't be new, that every day Needs renovation,âbut of this enough. See how thou stand'st now! as if my life were not Concerned in thy hast; Go, prethee go; And if perchance th'art ought concern'd in't, know 'Less thou dost this to day, th'ast seen the last Of wretched Euphanes. Exit. Phi. And if I do't to day, The world has seen the last of more wretched Philena,âOh me! I now do see âLove is a burthen two hearts equally âShould bear, and then 'tis light and pleasant, but âGrievous and intollerable when th'one âDoes bear it all alone. Mean time what shall I do? he well deserves To find no pity, who affords me none: But Love ne'r stands upon such nice respects, Who there where unfeignedly 't does Love profess, 't does never sin, but in officiousness. I am resolv'd to plead for him then against My self; and though my heart do disavow All my tongue says, spight of my heart, (in fine) 't shall say't, or I'll not avow it to be mine. Exit. SCENE IV. Pamphilus peeping after her. Pam. Hay,âwhurr,âthere boults another wench; The Warren's full of them; and I do but think What dainty sport I shall have In ferretting 'um; The very name o'th' place had Attraction Enough to draw me hither, where I expect To find all Women as coming and tractable, as Kids leather gloves, one gentle pull or two Will easily draw 'um on. I do not like Your difficil ones, who come as hardly off As a wet Summers boot;â Hey! there's another; and Alone too? this opportunity Is the shell Love's hatch'd of, and the wenches here, Like Lap-wings, run away with't on their heads. I'll accost her;âshee's right I'll warrant ye. SCENE V. Flamette, Pamphilus. Pam. Fair Nymph, might I be so bold (I pray) To request the time o'th' day of you? Fla. With all my heart Sir, take what time you will, It shall be any thing o'th' clock you please, for me. Pam. La ye there now? There's never a Sextons wife in all Cypres Could answer you more courteously.âLets see, What's next now? pox on't, we young practitioners Of complement, and dabblers in Love, When once w'ar out of our leggs &amp; faces, are presently out Of our discourse,âI, it shall be soâ And how, and how have you done Faith since I saw you last? Fla. Most methodical! how d'ee, and whats a clock? I'll wager with any one now, next is, what News? Or somewhat about the Weather; the ordinary Discourse of those who can discourse of nothing: And when (I pray) was it you saw me last? Pam. Why in Plato's great year, don't you remember it? When just after such an encounter as this, I took You by the hand, and kissing it, offered To lead you just into such another Grove as this. Fla. Just no such matter,âpray pray Sir stay, Sure you do n't remember well? Pam. Most perfectly, By the same token I offer'd to salute you too. [she puts him by. Fla. I knew you were quite wide, And out Sir, I?ânot me I can assure you. Pam. You cann't deny't I'm sure; Think, think, and you must needs remember it, I do as perfectly as if't were but to dayâ And how I told you, having so fair an opportunity, But lose it, and you'd never have the like agen. Fla. Wider and wider still from my remembrance. Pam. And that such kind offers from such kind youths as I, Came not every day;âand I added too withall, That I assur'd my self the Nymphs of this Countrie Were so well learn'd, their Husbands on the mariage night before Could teach 'um nothing, but what they knew Fla. Bless me! I never heard [aside.] Man talk a this manner. Pam. And for your particular, I durst be sworn first time y'ad Liberty, After fourteen to walk abroad alone, Returning home, you found that you had left Som such odd toys, as your Scarf, your Mask, &amp; gloves, And perhaps your Maiden-head, behind ye too. Fla. Thanks Love, thou hast redeem'd meâ She spies some coming. Oh! cry mercy Sir. Now I remember it Perfectly well: Lord what a Treacherous Memory have I! Pam. Oh d'ye so? I knew you would at lastâ Now she's mine own, I'm sure on't. Fla. By the same token, just As you talk'd thus wildly and licentiously Philostrates, Love's sovereign Pontif, and Governour o'th' Isle past by. Pam. Mas, and I think Yonder he comes indeed. Fla. When I Addressing me to him, and complaining of Your unworthy rudeness, he presently Invited you most honourably to dance To a certain sprighly Instrument, call'd a Whip, Worth a hundred of your Pochets and Violins To make such Gallants as you to frisk and caper. Pam. I remember nothing of all this nowâ But beshrow me I begin to fear, next Plato's great year I shall indeed, if I tarry longer here. Exiturus Fla. Hark ye, hark ye Sir, Now I can tell you what time o'th' day 'tis too. Pam. I know it now, I thank you, well enough, 'tis time for me to be gon as I take it. Exit. Fla. Farewell then my Platonique Lover, and a fair riddanceâBut to My businesse. I wonder where all The Nymphs are, that none of them appears. I must go seek 'um out. SCENE VI. Philostrates, Polydor, Euphanes, Love's Mysti, Chorus of old, young, and middle age, &amp;c. Pol. And what dispatch to the Provincial governours, Touching Platonique Love? Philo. Tell 'um we're men, pure spirits, and had no other end But only the propagating Ideas this communicating Of minds to minds might passe, which now has So slippery a way to go: It's outre tendance most commonly falls fowl O'th'Body in its passage towards the Soul, Yet in those colder climats have Phlegm enough To quench their amorous flames, 'tmay be allow'd, But no ways to those hotter Nations, Whose sulphurous Spirits presently take fire At presence of their Mistresses; Nor Is't but with Much caution to be permitted to different Sexes, Unlesse of age more different: for distinction Is the Art of Wisdom, and who imagins One measure for all Bodies may suffice, And one rule for all minds, are equally unwise. Pol. The sacred Philostrates speaks divinest truth. Phi. So 'mongst these Chymerical speculations, Like the Alchymists great Elixar, rarely Or never are reducible to Art, And practice, it may passâAn other abuse They much complain of (and deservedly) Is the confounding Love with Liking, and Calling of every trivial passion Love; Each Peasant now who likes but a dairy Maid, Crying out, He is in Love, profaning so The Divinity of Love, by making him companion Of every vulgar breast. Pol. As every School-boy too Once past the School, and School-boys toys, next toy He gets, is a Mistress, whom he straightways courts I'th' canting language of Enamourists, Of darts and flames, and dying and languishing, Which he calls Love forsooth, so many degrees Remov'd from't, tis scarce the coverture Love is infolded in, (a dutious heart, Obsequious services, and sincere respects.) Phi. True Polydor, such affected triflings Are as far from Love, as Valour is from Boast, Or Wisdom from Levity; But who can hinder The ignorant from being ignorant still? So let us leave 'um, and pass to our other Affairs: Let the Chorus advance singing in praise of Love, Whilst the Mysti explicate its sacred mysteries, To inform, and indoctrinate the tender minds Of Youths and Virgins in its Religious rites; For Musick and Poetry, Are the Language, and the Accent of the Gods, Speaking unto us in a diviner strain, And moving our minds with far more Energie, Than plain dull Rhetorique, Religion Still entring easilier, and penetrating more Profoundly, those hearts th'ave softned before. Enter Chorus and Euphanes. Chorus sings. Prais'd be the Deities above. Old. We Lov'd. Mid. We Love. Young. And we shall Love. Chorus. Thus by succession we go, Love to Love connecting so; Whilst link of Age to Age we knit, W'eternize, and perpetuate it. Mysti. Now our doctrine to begin, From Love's diviner origin; Know two different Loves there are In hearts, incessantly do warr, Th'on a lustfull brutish one, Tother Venus Urania's Son, With his Celestial darts and fires In chast hearts kindling pure desires, Distance 'twixt whom as much there is, As 'twixt high Heaven, and deep Abyss; As by th'effects you'll easily find, Since th'one imbrutes and soils a mind, Whilst th'others purity ne'r can Admit of blemish, spot, nor stain. As unconsistent too as night And darknesse is with cleerest light, âFor i'th' same place, on the same day, âThe Swine and Ermin never lay. In a word then for to tell What virtuous Love is, mark me well, 'tis a just temper of our Souls, All vitious extreams controuls, 'tis the gust we have and sense Of every noble Excellence, It is that whereby we know Whether our Souls have sense or know, It is the main spring that our minds To fair and virtuous things inclines, And 't's that and only that in fine, Which makes men next unto Divine Eup. I better can tell you what it isâ 'tis a mixture and compound of all We happy and unhappy call, 'tis a contradiction again A bitter sweetnesse and a pleasant pain; In one word what Love is to tell, Look in Bellinda's Eyes it is a Heaven, Look in Euphanes Heart it is a Hell. Exit Phil. So now march on before, And as you have initiated so proceed, And finish the solemnity of the day. Exit Chorus singing. Cho. Prais'd be the Deitys above. Old. We lov'd. Middle. We love. You. And we shall love. Cho. Thus by succession we go, Love to Love connecting so; Whilst link of Age to Age we knit, W' eternize, and perpetuate it. Phil. Now to the rest Of our affairs: Is the Nymph summon'd to The Temple yet? Pol. 'Tis yet not time. Phil. When 'tis, Be it your care to see it done, and all The rites and ceremonies in prepare For the great solemnity: This day peculiarly Love is thine Work miracles on't, and shew thy self divine.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. Bellinda sola. Bell. Ye aged Oaks, the semi-gods aboads, And who your selves in antient times were gods; Ye silent walks, and solitary groves, Places which melancholy passion loves, You I make only Confident of My secret thoughts; I love, O dissipate My words some gentle wind, in such minute, And aiery particles, none in soft Characters May ever read, nor ever find imprest, This most important secret of my brest; But whe'r my lov'd Philander live, or no, Heaven knows, I do not know By other Argument than that I live my self, Have so dear sympathy with him, infallibly, Were he but dead, I instantly should die, Our Loves and Lives having but one thrid, one knife, And once but cut our Loves, and cut our Life: Mean time my daily musings which only ar But waking dreams, and nightly Dreams, which ar But sleeping Actions, both testimony bears, âLove's a solicitous thing, and full of Fears,â But soft, I've blab'd too much I fear, See Philena coming here. SCENE II. Philena, Bellinda. Phi. My dear Bellinda! and where have you bin so long Without Philena! to call me your life, and live So long without me! to call me your heart, and make Me such a stranger to your breast! trust me 'tis most Unkindly, most unnaturally don. Bel. Sweetest Philena, until my heart was all Repleat with bitterness, I call'd you my heart indeed; And till I was a weary of my life, I esteem'd you as my life; but now all the joy, Delight, and Comfort lost, Bellinda has My heart and life, being all comfited In bitterness and woe, It is not fit I longer call you so. Phi. A sad Complement, this Bellinda, and such A little shu'd have attended from so dear a friend: Complements in friendship being like Sinister bars In Haraldry, but marks of Bastardice; Why serve friends, but when cares and woes molest, To lighten th'heavy burthen of our breast? But to be confident w'ye, I much suspect You are not so with me, and that ther's somewhat Of Artifice in't, you decline my company So much; and make me not partaker of Your secret thoughts. Bel. Of all I know, I will, And do Philena; but the gods know ther's Somewhat in my brest I do not know my self; You who are my heart, divine it if you can. Phi. Nay if you know it not, how should your heart That's but a part of you? But give me leave Bellinda to admire, that in so general a Commotion and solicitude for you, You shou'd appear so little solicitous, So little mov'd, and so unconcern'd to day, whilst all Are concern'd so much for you; Trust me 'tis A Temper, or above, or below humanity. Bel. I'll tell thee Philena, I have considered, That of all Creatures, Man's the most ingenious In's own own affliction, and in's consolation the Most dull; and that i'th navigation of This life, in this frail barque of ours, where th'Gods Are Pilots, and the World the Sea, our solicitude For the future no more avails Than that of every common Passenger, how The ship is govern'd: Whence I conclude that best Way for our quiets and rest, Is to leave all our solicitude to the Gods, To whom w'are dearer than w'are unto our selves, They having a hundred times more tender care of us; And this 'tis now makes me for the future no more solicitous, Phi. This Bellinda for our sex Is high Philosophy, but the gods making Every one Architect of their own fortunes; what Should hinder you to day to make a fair And noble one of yours? and but declare You love Euphanes, as already you have declar'd, If any one in th'Isle you love it shall be he. Bell. And so I do again, let that suffice, And seek not Philena, I prithy, to advance An unprofitable knowledge, Time will, but too soon, Accelarat, and bring to light. Phi. Ay me! what says my frend? Bell. To explicate My meaning clearer, too soon, for you I mean, Are intrest by your Goodness and Gentleness So far in my Affairs, you necessarily must Or lose a friend, or Lover by't. SCENE III. Polydor, Philena, Bellinda. Phi. Now gentle Polydor, What news from th'Temple? Pol. All there is in prepare For th'great solemnity, and only fair Bellindas presence expected; Into whose brest May th'God of Love propitiously inspire As many loving thoughts, as ever yet Were crowded into any's brest, Or amorous bosom had capacity to receive. Bel. Come Philena, let's away then. Phi. So sudden, and so unmov'd! [aside.] I suspect her more and more; to doubtful things We run not with such hast and Resolution; And if she be resolv'd, there's somewhat in't, That she conceals it from me! Pol. 'Tis happy Augury, (No doubt) this hast of hers: Love has invisible Attractions, and chains, which who follows, visibly Perceives at last, this gentle force of his Does but conduct them to their greater bliss. SCENE IV. Pamphilus looking after the Nymphs, Polydor. Pam. Such a Wench Would I give a Limb for now, although I begg'd On Crutches ever after, and were confiscated to The Hospital,âI must needs have her; and this Same fellow shall be my agent in the business, D'e hear Sir? do you know Any of these Nymphs, I pray? Pol. That I do Sir, very well, What then? Pam. Why then I should desire Your better acquaintance: For look ye Sir, suppose A man should have a mind to one of them. Pol. A mind! What mind d'ye mean? Pam. Why a months mind or so. Pol. Why then Sir after a month, for ought I know You may be rid on'tâThis is (Aside Some foolish stranger, rather deserving my Pity than Anger. Pam. I hope you do not mock me Sir? Pol. Indeed Sir but I do. Pam. 'tis well you confesse it, otherwise I should be very angryâBut since I see Y'are a little dull; in plainer terms, I'd fain Have about with one of them; d'ye apprehend me Sir? Pol. I think I shall doâBut know you Sir where you are, That you dare talk thus? Pom. Why, in Love's Dominions, Where should I be? Pol. In Lusts rather, for Loves is not for you, if you Be such an one, and so as Loves Minister, Less you better know to temper your Toung, and mend Your behaviour, I command you sir Straight to depart the Isle. Pam. I hope you are not in earnest? Pol. Indeed sir but I am. Pam. Tis well you are so, for I Don't love to be jested with I tell you plain. Pol. It seems you love to jest Sir, but Look to't, and so farewell. Exit Pam. Slud, this is the unreasonablest Fellow I ever met withal in my life, a man Cann't talk of a Wench but he is angry! Temper your Tongue, and mend your behaviour, When can you tell? Loves Minister d'ye call him, If he teach no better doctrine, he scarce deserves To be Minister to the Family of Love. SCENE V. Flamette with others, Pamphilus, &amp;c. Fla. What? my Enamourist agen! Sure then, being so well accompanied I'll have some sport with him. Pam. Gods so, she here! I'll away then. Exiturus Fla. D'y hear d'y hear Sir? pray come forwards here, And don't turn Sea-crab,âd'ye behold that Gentlem?? He is one of the terriblest persecutors of yong nymphs, H'as no mercy with him; And's so in love with himself, He imagins all women are in love with him too; Nay, will swear it, if they but look upon him once,â Ther is nothing so cold, as to hear him talk of flames; And 'twer enough to make a body forswear love, but To see how he makes it;ânay, be n't asham'd Of your own Commendations. Pam. Commendations d'ye call it? what are your Reproches pray? If these be your Commendations? [aside.] Fla. Then if he pretend To Poetry (that's Riming with him) he wearies PhÅbus And all the Muses, to find him out similitudes Of Rubies, Pearl, Gold, and Diamonds, To compare with his Mistresses lips, teeth, eys, &amp; hair: If not, he his yet a more solemn fool in Prose, With's speech imbroder'd, just like your Masquing cloaths, With Oos and Aspirations, and never a word Of sense in them,âsee now how he fleers and grins, The common put-off of the Fool and Impudent. Pam. To have an Anatomy Lecture Read over me alive thus, there's no induring it. Fla. Nay, I'll promise ye You shall endure it, and twenty times more to boot, If I meet with you again. Pam. Y'ave met with me Already, I thank you, but if I meet with you Alone, I'll make y' indure somwhat too for this. Fla. Threaten'd too? nay then have at you with Another trick; well Sir, having sufficiently try'd Your patience, and finding it invincible, I'll let you see now all the Nymphs here are not So cruel as you imagin th?,âmeet me but hereabouts When Bellinda's gon to the temple, &amp; I'll promise you I'll bring you to the gentlest Nymph in Cypres, So far from coy, you may do what you will with her, She can deny you nothing nor say nay to any thing. Pam. I marry Sir, &amp; such an one wou'd I meet withall,â I knew I could not be so grossy deceiv'd In the dispositions of the Nymphs minds here, And Constitutions of their Bodies. Fla. Look you fail not now. Pam. Nay, if I fail at such Assignations, Call me Eunuch. Fla. [Musick.] And if I don't fit you, call me foolâbut hark, The pomp draws nigh, and the procession From the Temple, dilating of it self, And swelling with numerous multitudes, fils up all The spacious and ample Plain. SCENE VI. Philostrates, Polydor, Flamette, Pamphilus, Chorus, Bellinda, Philena, &amp;c. Cho. sings Holy Love that do'st command In Fire, Water, Air, and Land, Gently thy commands inspire To all in Land, Air, Water, Fire, Philos. [Enter Polydor] Now is the Nymph come? Pol. Behold great Sir shee's hereâ Know you the reason Philena why Euphanes Is not present? [aside] Phile. He misdoubts his temper, And therefore wisely do's absent himself. Pol. I fear'd some other cause, &amp; am glad he's so discreetâ Stand by there. to Pamphilus in his way Pam. What are you there whiffling agen? Goodly, Goodly, heer's more ado With your under Officers Philos. Draw nigh then Nymph, and t'understand What Sacred mysteries in every Ceremony Involved lie, Know first By this sprinkling's signified he sprinkles her with his asperge How minds ar to be purified Er' they receive the Deity, Who deigns in purified breasts alone To make on earth its habitation: Next for your Eys and Ears by which two ports There often issues forth, and enters in Much pollution and sin (And by one sluce bootlesly we should drain Out Objects, if by another we let them in again) Veiling your Eys w'are to conduct you to The sacred Cell, where far from noise Of Tumult and the publick voice, Only attending to holy orisons An hower inclos'd y'are to remain: No bosom (in fine) but wholy abstracted and Sequestred from humane consortship, Being capable of Divineâ So before (for compliment of all) We charm you silent, If you have ought to say Now freely spake Bel. Unto the Gods I need not speak seeing they know my mind, And to men I will not, seeing it is not fit They know it yetâwhat should I say then, but Behold th'intirely resign'd Bellinda here stands Ready to obey your holy orders and The Gods Divine commands. Phil. Reach us the sacred wand then, whilst we thus Invoke with due solemnity, silence to come, And in its softer chains bind up her Tongue. Still born silence thou that art he waves his wand above her head. Floodgate of the deeper heart Offspring of a heavenly kind, Frost o'th' mouth, and Thaw o'th' mind, Secrecies Confident, and he That makes Religion mystery; Admirations speakingst tongue, Leave thy desart shades, among Reverend Hermits hallowed cells, Where retir'dst devotion dwells, With thy Enthusiasms come Seize this Nymph, and strike her dumb,â Now give us the sacred veil he veils her. To veil her eyes,âthus Nymph We close your eyes tow'rds Earth, and open 'um Tow'rds Heavenâ Now whilst the air you sweetly move, Gently excite her mind to Love, âFor Musick to Religion, â's just like those who temper and mold the wax âFor th'seals impression The Song voce sola. VVhilst with her Lilly and Rosie hands Nature molds beauteous forms, Love stands, And ever as he does espy A fair and gentle one, This, this, is fit for me To work upon, sayes he, And layes it by. Chorus. What fools are those then who can miss, So grosly to suppose Bellinda, and mark how gentle sh' is And fair: were none of those Whom Love's own hands had chose? Philost. Now let the pompous train move on, and let The Musick in sweet harmonious strains, O'r all these spacious plains, Resounding higher yet, Invocate Loves sacred Deity T'impose blest end to this solemnity. Chorus sings. Holy Love, that dost command In Fire, Water, Air, and Land, Gently thy commands inspire, To all in Land, Air, Water, Fire. Exeunt omnes. Manet Pamphilus, Flamette. Pam. Here's a do indeed! I could have dispatcht her my way In half this time, and with half these Ceremonies too; But let her go, andânow if this Wench Perform but her promise, shee'll redeem Her self and this Isle from my ill opinion;â And see just where she comes. Flamette Enters. Fla. Oh! 'tis well you're here. The Nymph I told you ofâ Pam. I, where is she? where is she? I long To see her. Fla. You shall find Sleeping in the wood there. Pam. Excellent opportunity! And is she so kind say you? Fla. So kind (as I told you) and so far from coy, You may do what you will with herâshe can Deny you nothing, nor say no to anything. Pam. And I'll put her too't presently Fla. Behold her there, But look you don't disturb her. Pam. a Nymph sleeping discovered. Ah pretty Rogue? Have I caught you napping? at these breaches he looks nearly on her. She sleeps as snugg &amp; soundly as A sucking piggâyou can scarce hear her breath,â Shee's handsom, exceeding handsom, I see that, A very Goddess;âthe gods make me thankfull, Hey, hey,âhow jocund shall I be? [Capers.] Fla. Softly, softly. Pam. Oh! I'd forgot,âsoft he spruces up himself. I think she stirs,âwhat a sloven was I Not to put on a clean band to day? No 'twas only the leaves,âI'll jogg her softly,â But first I'll steal a kisse of her whilst she sleeps,â Ha! how's this? he discovers it to be a Puppet only. Fla. Ha, ha, ha. Pam. By this hand A Maukin, a Mammet, a very Moppet with No more life in't than a Scar-crow, or The Puppet of a Tire womans stall. Fla. Ha ha ha, Make much of your Mistresse Sir. [Exit] Pam. D'you laugh too? shame on her how she has cozen'd me; Is this your Gentle Nymph with a vengeance, So far from coy you may do what you will with her, She can deny you nothing, nor say no to any thing: So me thinks indeedâhey discovers the wood. This is the Log now And tother the stork, 'tis 'question which wou'd make The better Mistresseâonly this I may mock While tother mocks meâfarewell to your Ladyship. throws it away and Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Scene, Loves Temple, many passing toward it: afterwards Philander Solus. Phi. Hail happy land, where if th'Oracle prove But true, Philander agen shall find his Love, Whom six Moons now have just been in their wain, And six with light replenished again, Since in a storm I lost, whilst I detain'd, A wofull Captive have e'r since remaind; Until at last releast, I suddenly Addrest me to th'sacred Oracle, to know Whether my dear Bellinda liv'd, or no, And consequently to know, whe'r I Should either live or dye; When this answer I receiv'd, That as on Cyprian Seas I lost her, where Venus, Loves Queen, floating did first appear, So I should find her on Cyprian Land again, Where Venus fix'd perpetually does remain. SCENE II. Euphanes, Philander. Eup. Impatient of expectancy, I'm come Hither to the Temple, to await my doom, Fear of which made me absent my self before, Untill in lieu of one fear, a thousand more Soliciting my breast, I did conclude, Still more in absence, than presence, sollicitude Does urge our bosoms, as Terrors do more affright I'th' dark, than in the light. Philan. Strange! th'houses should be all so desolate, As some Plague had swept'um, and th'land depopulat, As th'Enemy had mow'd it with his sword! But see one here to inform my wonder, And curiosity. Gentle Sir, Might a stranger newly ariv'd here, desire to know, Why all do flock unto the Temple so? Is't any annual feast (perhaps) they celebrat? Eup. No Sir, but one Meer Accident has produc'd to day, For understanding which, be pleas'd to know, That by this Ilands Laws all Strangers, after A six-months residence, are solemnly To swear they love some one here, or else Abjure the Isle:â Now Sir, six months to day are just expir'd, Since there ariv'd here one o'th' most admir'd Nymphs, as ever in Cypres yet was known, And most deserving Admiration, By tempest cast on shore here, surprizing so th'while With her excellent beauty th'Inhabitants of this Isle, With pious error they all adored her As a second Venus, a second time Ascending from the Sea. Nor was this Idolatry By Venus punished as any crime at all, Since Cupid's self did on th'like error fall, Imagining her his Mother, she was so fair, And so at all parts most resembling her. Philan. The Time and every Circumstance agree [aside.] It should be she,âand her Name I pray Sir? Eup. Bellindaâ Phila. Her name too, then No farther evidence nor circumstance do's need, For to confirm me it is shee indeedâ [aside] And where's this Nymph Sir now? Eup. I'th sacred Cell Straight to be produc'd to take the solelmn Oath. Phi. And i'st suppos'd she'll take it? Eup. That's doubtfull yet, but this I know, That lesse she do, you behold in me here Sir The wofullest Lover as ever yet for love Sighing and groaning gaspt out his latest breath, The Dreggs of life, and Harbingers of death. Phi. Ha! I like not thisâ And has she given you no hope Sir of her love? For love without hope's but a dry morsell, and goes But hardly down. Eup. Only this Sir, that if any one she loves Sh'as promis'd it should be me. Phi. Nay then you have enough, for Nature gives not Youth and beauty, but o'th' condition Of loving, and their sex gives pledges unto love Reciprocally againâBut why goe I vainly thus Hunting with mine own curiosity, Mine own disquietâI've ta'n in poyson already at Mine Ear, And feel it workingâdefend me Reason from Thine Enemy Rage, and thou defend me Love From thy more deadly Enemy Iealousie, Thou bring'st forth just as the Viper does its brood, When all its endeavour after all its strife, Is to give death to thee who gav'st it lifeâ But see in happy time variety Of other objects to divert my mind From farther thought of it. SCENE III. Chorus, Pamphilus, &amp;c. to them Mysti. Now you Virgins all draw near, And most needfull doctrine hear; First be modest as you go, For each looser glance you strow Will be interpreted a snare To catch those youths that present are, And you rowling eyes betray A heart that rowls as well as they. Cho. sings. O fly then far, Glances that are But sparkles of a wanton fire, And pledges of a loose desire, Fly rowling eyes that but betray A heart that rowls as well as they: Pam. Here's Doctrine' with a murren, able to infect all The young Wenches in the Parish. [aside] Mysti. Then for kisses, Oh be sure Never Virgins those indure, Are but bellows blows the fire Of Lascivious desire, But seals of Lust, and poyson, that Infect the Mind and Body strait; And your lips with kissing us'd, Are but just like Cherries bruz'd. Chorus sings. O fly then far Kisses, that are Incentives of foul Lust, which no Virgins lips shou'd ever know; Whose lips once with kissing us'd, Are but just like Cherries bruz'd. Pam. Heyday! no kissing neither? God help the poor Country wenches then, For all their sport is marr'd. Mysti. But 'bove all Virgins agen, Look you fly the Touch of men, For you'r flowres, and every Touch, Does your fresher beauty smutch: And Youth's a thing so delicate, But touch it, and it withers strait, Which once fading in their hew, Youth and Beauty then Adieu. Chorus sings. O fly then far Touches, that are Things, Youth and Beauty chiefly blasts, And on them foulest blemish casts, Which once fading in their hew, Youth and Beauty then Adieu. Pam. Pity a their breeding! these wenches will be quite spoyl'd With this Education, and good for nothing, but To make Inckle and bone-lace. Mysti. Lastly, for injoying, I Need not warn you that to fly, For flowers gather'd there's no talk, E'r to piece 'um to their stalk; And 'tis only that the while, Makes you so contemn'd, and vile, Men, what e'r they did before, Never care for Women more. Chorus sings. O fly then far Your men that are Only born for to destroy you, Since if once they but enjoy you, Whatsoe'r they did before, They never care for Women more. Pam. Were not Love's Inquisition here so severe, I could teach 'um other doctrine, whose Liberty Would please 'um a great deal better; but well, Wou'd I had my Moppet agen, At all adventures, for that's the likelyest thing To a Wench I'm like to get here, for ought I see, If they be taught a-this manner. Eup. By Philostrates return They should be coming; oh how my heart does burn, And throb now, with doubtful expectation Of the event! SCENE IV. Philostrates, Polydor, Bellinda, Philena, to them, &amp;c. Philos. So now produce her. Pol. Behold great Sir she's here. Bellinda veiled lead by Philena, &amp; presented by Polydor Phila. If there be any Sympathy In Lovers hearts, 'tis she. Philos. Draw nigh then Nymph, and laying your hands Upon this sacred Volume here, Where on the skins of Doves and Swans Love's 'holy Laws recorded are, Swear; But swear truly, on penalty of no lesse Than forfeiture of life if you transgresse: Unveil her there. Phila. They unveil her and she suddenly casts her eyes aside towards the place where Euphanes and Philander stand. Ha, 'tis she! ye Gods 'tis she, But Oh my jealousie, tell me some one Skilfull in decyphering Love's Character, Whether that glance the superscription of An amorous heart was directed to him or me. Eup. What ails this stranger! Pol. What means these sudden starts of hers. And change of colour. Philo. Veil her presently again, since she so ill Governs her eys, th'are straying stillâ They veil her again. Fie Nymph be more Religious-wise And restrain those wandring eys, Who in objects takes delight, Brings distraction with the sight, In their breasts do never find A holy recollected mindâ Now approach her nearer. Eup. Now I shall know my destiny, And whether I'm to live or die. Phila. Now Philander thou shalt know Whether she be true or no. Phile. Now Philena thou shalt soon Proove her faith, and know thy doom, Philos. (waves his wand Proceed and swear then, thus I uncharm thy Tongue. Bel. Then by Love's sacred Deity I swear, I love one here. Philos. with the waving of his wand he charms her silent again. Enough. Eup. O blest voice which heavenly minds applaud With their celestial wings; Oh me most happy! Philan. And most unhappy I. Pol. Did I not tel you it was impossible But she shou'd Love. O day ever to be Recorded in the Calendar of Love, For holy and festival; Which never may Oblivion, that like a torrent rouls All things along with't to the Lethean Lake, Abolish the happy memory of. Phile. Oh the Dissembler, how she as deceiv'd me! Philost. Conduct her agen now to the sacred cell, Where yet an hour she's to remain, E'r we dissolve our magick spell; And then with indicible joy we are again to produce her, And solemnly deliver her for ever to repose In's dear imbraces she has for Lover chose. Chorus sings. [as she goes out.] Prais'd be Love, that does command In Fire, Water, Air, and Land, And so gently does inspire All in Land, Air, Water, Fire. Manent Philena, Pamphilus, Flamette. Pam. I should laugh now, if I were he she lov'd, As who knows but she may be enamoured Of my person, as I of hers, there's nothing impossible. Phile. Well, for her sake I'll ne'r trust Stranger more. Pam. Fair Nymph, I should desire The honour of conducting you to your lodging, If 't might not be troublesom. Fla. Troublesom? who doubts it? why Th'art nothing else but trouble. Phile. Fie Flamette, this is discourteous, And to a stranger too! Pam. She tels you true,âpray be gone, And don't trouble us,âyou see there are some will accept Of my Courtesie now, though you won't he leads Philena out Fla. Neither wou'd she, did she know thee as well as I, But let her go, when th'ast abus'd her curtesy, As thou dost others, to molestation, she'll know thee better. But this sudden turn of Bellinda's affection Is wondrous strange! SCENE V. Euphanes, Philander, Polydor, severally. Phila. Bellinda false! O ye Gods where then Are Faith and Vowes and Oaths; nay where are you Your selves; for I shall doubt whe'r Love Have any Divinity now at all, and think All's but Idolatry, and women that y'ar Angels Till we make you Devils by our adoring ye. Eup. There's no joy like your unexpected one 't comes so strikingânot falling upon The expectation first, that deads and dulls The blow. This intermixing difficulty With Love, and leading you unto the very brink Of despair, and then hoysting you up again, There is the Art on't, and that she Grand Artifex of it as she is Full well did understand. Philan. The more I think on't, the more It puzzles my belief and imagination, I will Suspend my faith and patience then until Her farther Declaration may confirm me, And give my passions their full carier. Eup. Heavens I am so over-joy'd, So ravished with't, and in so high transport, Me thinks like Metors I even walk in Air, And have nought of Earth about me, nor other fear But only presently to expire and die In Bellinda's sweet embraces. Phila. Nay then Were my patience bound in Adamantine chains I'd break 'um allâknow Sir you have Another Victory to obtain before You triumph thusâand perhaps too the Fates Have provided you another death to die Than what you fear so much. Eup. [Enter Polydor] What's that I pray? Phila. Why, to die by Philanders hand, for know Sir Bellinda 's my espous'd. Eup. Yours? Phila. Yes mine, for all your scorn Sir, And be assur'd, long as I live, that man Is not alive shall injoy her besides my self. Pol. How's this? but this Must be prevented [Exit hastily Phil. Wherefore or quit and relinquish your claim of her, Or follow me strait to the shore, where she first Set foot a land, that so that ground she then did tread May receive one of us dead, Who cann't be enjoy'd by both of us alive. Eup. Although bold stranger I might well decline Thy challenge, not knowing whe'r thy quality Be equal unto mine, and assured Our conditions are not (by thine own confession) I being as happy in Bellinda's love As thou unhappy, which makes thee desperate of Thy life perhaps: yet know I'll be so noble For Bellinda's sake to kill thee this once my self, Who else might leave Thee to a hundred more ignoble deaths: Nor is this Arrogance in me, but Confidence That those who have honour of Bellinda's love Cann't but come off victorious in fight. Philan. Elated by good Fortune, you talk high Sir, Pray Heaven you do so,âbut Love Shall straight determine who has the better cause, Th'injust possessor of Bellinda, or Th'injuriously depriv'd of her, If thou dar'st but fight In so unjust a Quarrel. Eup. Ha, ha, ha, if I dare? for that never fear, I'll but instantly arm my self, and meet thee there. SCENE VI. Polydor with Guards, Euphanes, Philander. Pol. Stay,â By order from Philostrates I'm to Secure your persons. Phil. Mine? [offers to draw.] Pol. Hold,â In Love's Dominion, where no force is offer'd, In vain is all resistance.â Now though bold stranger the disturbance of The peace here, and sowing of Enmity and Dissention in a happy soyl Produces nought but Gentle Peace and Amity, Deserves a more exemplar Chastisement, yet here Wher favors are to th'utmost extended, &amp; punishment The most contracted, Confinement to your Chamber shall Be all your punishment. Phil. And is't a-this manner then Lovers in Love's Dominion are treated, not only To be depriv'd of their Liberties, but of Their Spouses too? Pol. What Spouse? Philan. Bellinda. Pol. And is she then your Spouse? Phil. All Greece can witnesse it. Pol. Too much of witness already you have here, If this be true. But this must be examined More narrowly by Philostrates; mean time Indiscreetly have you done in publishing a secret Might better have bin conceal'd, which now tis known May prove Bellinda's ruine, and your own,â You Euphanes. Have your Chamber for prisonâyou must along with me Eup. I obey you Sir. Phila. And I necessity. Exeunt several way Guarded. Finis Actus Tertii.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. The Scene as at first. SCENE I. Pamphilus, Philena. Phi. So now Sir my humble thanks For the honour y'a pleas'd to do me. Pam. Nay Lady, I'll Wayt upon you in, that's certain, I'm not So coursly bred, nor so ill mannerd. Phi. I should be at least Sir, to trouble you fartherâand Engage your courtesie so much. Pam. No trouble in the world, tis pleasure to me rather. Phi. Pray Sir excuse me, I am presently To go forth again on visit. Pam. Why I'll accompany you, And wait upon you thither too. Phi. By no means Sir, 'tis to a friend of mine Y'are not acquainted with, besides I have Some businesseâ Pam. Nay an't be to a friend of yours I must needs Be acquainted with them, being so much your servant as I am, And for your business, my presence Shall no ways hinder its dispatch. Phi. Now I think on't too, I must visit by the way A friend of mine there lately brought abed,â Won't that shake him off? [aside.] Pam. I'll wait upon you thither too. I Am the welcom'st man amongst the Gossips, You won't think how they love my Company. Phi. Tis a sign I'm none then,âno getting rid of him! Oh see in happy Time Flamette here. SCENE II. Flamette, Pamphilus, Philena. Phil. Prithy Flamette, an' thou lov'st me, get me rid Of this Importune heer; is more tedious Than a painful-sleepless night, and worser than A Feaver or Catharr, I am even sick of him. Fla. Oh! have you found him then? This comes of your complacency, I told ye so, All curtesie is cast away on him, and discurtesie Is no discurtesie to such as he, Who either brag of favours they ne'r received, Or else abuse those they receive of us. Pam. I, I shall be sure Of your good word still, but no matter what You say, she knows me well enough, and I Know what I owe too, to such Nymphs as she. Fla. Nothing but a blanquetting as I know of. Pam. Come Lady shall we go? offers to take her by the hand. Phi. What shall I do to rid me of this Importune? Fla. Why an' take my counsel, a flat denyal's best, And if that won't do, a good Cudgel; I know No other way. Pam. Come, come, let her talk Till her tongue's a-weary, and let us go. Phi. Still does this Burr Stick on me? Fla. Burr? he is Pitch rather, defiles all those He touches; 'tis imputation enough of Curtezan For any Nymph but to be seen in's Company: But hear you not the News? Pam. Huh! she must come Tattling with her News now! Phi. No, what ist? Fla. The lamentablest and dolefullest. As ever yet was heard in Cypres, Will leave, I fear, no heart without a sorrow, No eye without a tear. Phi. For heavens Love what? Fla. Why Bellinda, The lovely Bellinda, and so belov'd of all, Who merited to live beyond the natural bounds Of life, this day untimely is to die. Phi. Ay me! how so? Fla. Condemn'd to death By our Ilands Laws, for falsifying her faith To Gods and men, in swearing she lov'd one here, Whilst 'tis prov'd she was betroath'd before Unto another. Phi. And how's that known? Fla. By a Stranger's arrival here Just on the point she took the sacred Oath, And proving her forsworn. Phi. Strange! but on a strangers bare information This may not be believ'd, there may be malice, And consequently falshood in it,âand may't not be That other to whom she was betroth'd, she swears she loves? Fla. The Oath you know admits no such equivocation, Being expresly limited to some one in the Isle. Phi. And so may he be for ought we know. Fla. What probability of that? And you at her lodging ne'r know of it!â No no, her guilt's but too apparent. Pam. Ugh, ugh, ugh. [He cryes] Fla. What ails the Fool? Pam. Oh I've lost the best Wife, the best Wife As ever poor Husband hadâwhat shall I do? What shall I do? Fla: Why prethee go hang thy self, So we were rid of thee. Pam. Oh, oh, such a Wife! such a wife! [exit crying] Phi. I see now The man is vain and foolish,âbut this is wondrous strange; The patient gods latter or sooner still Follow ('tis true) all crimes with punishment, But just i'th Act to meet her punishment Declares them mightily offendedâI can't believe it yet, Where there is gain in sinne, there is excuse For sinning, but he sins twice who commits An unprofitable crime, as must be this of hers, To lose her life for nothing, for an Oath, A breath. Fla. Unhappy breath the Whilst, And most unhappy she, That what is cause of others living shou'd be Her cause of deathâbut see where Polydor comes, We shall know all of him. SCENE III. Polydor to them, speaking to some within: Pol. For the Prisoners now you may restore 'um to their liberties; With prohibition only of wearing arms, Death being their Rivall ther's no fear now Of their farther Rivalship. Phi. O Polydor Is this news true? Pol. Too true alas, unfortunate she the while, Vnfortunate we, unfortunate all the Isle. Phi. Never gave Fate then a greater document, If the fair Bellinda be to die, No beauty's proof gainst death and calamitieâ But this comes of dissembling, and now I see That Falshood and Dissembling are but twins, And wher t'one ends, the other but begins. SCENE IV. Chorvs, Mysti, Polydor. Pol. O welcom, welcom, and in this general dismay, Tell us, since Love so gentle was of old, As w'ar by Antient Sages told, Whence is it, that to day He so tyrannical and cruel proves? Mysti. That's Fortunes fault, &amp; none of Love's,âfor know, Love and Death o'th' way once meeting, Having pass'd a friendly greeting, Sleep their weary ey-lids closing, Lay them down themselves reposing; When this Fortune did befall um, Which after did so much apall 'um: Love whom divers cares molested, Could not sleep, but whilst Death rested, All in hast away he posts him, But his hast full dearly costs him; For it chanc'd that going to sleeping, Both had given their darts in keeping Unto Night, who, Errors mother, Blindly knowing not th'one from th'other, Gave Love Death's, and ne'r perceiv'd it, Whilst as blindly Love receiv'd it; Since which time, their darts confounding, Love now kils, instead of wounding, Death our hearts with sweetness filling, Gently wounds, instead of killing. Pol. Next, pray tell us with what fire Our brests are charg'd, that our desire And hearts so vehemently shou'd move Towards the Object of our Love? Mysti. That speculation is more high, And deeper the Philosophie; Know, that from the Impulsion Of self-divided things does come, Which separated, are in pain To re-unite and joyn again, As branches we asunder bend, Forcibly again tow'rds one another tend; For Nature did both sexes knit At first in one Hermaphrodit, Till finding by conjunction so near, Both but more dull, and more unactive were To edge their Appetite agen She sever'd and dis-joyned them, Whence does proceed that gentle pain, And longing appetite to conjoyn again. SCENE VI. Euphanes to them. Eup. Bellinda to dye! O ye just gods, whom yet I will not blame, Nor asperse with foul imputation and stain Of such a horrid crime, till she be dead; And then though you show'r down all your punishments And plauges upon my head, I'll say 'twas cruelly and unjustly done. Phi. Enter Philander another way. O Heaven and Earth! Why do's not t'one sink under me? and tother Fall on my cursed head, am guilty of Bellinda's death? but yet 'tis needless too, For though they both Forbear to punish me, I do so loath My hated life for't, I'll die in spight of them, If flames, or steel, or precipices have any force To take away a life. Eup. To be conducted by Love only to Hope, And have only a glimpse of Hope to light Me so despair! if this be to Love and Hope, Happy who hate, and those who desperate are. Phi. To have sought her only to find her false! And found her, only to be the loss of her! Eup. Cruel Fortune thus to have lifted me up, Only to throw me more violently down again. Phi. But I dally and trifle, a friendly Sword Might do me a pleasure now; and see in happy time Euphanes who for need could help me. Eup. Art thou there murtherer? compleat thy wickedness then And take my life too, Bellinda's but half dead yet; When thou hast slain me, thou shalt find the other half Here panting in my Bosom. Phi. I prethee spare Thy reproaches Euphanes, and do not add Affliction to Affliction; have more humanity Than to wound a dying man: know I am more Miserable already than Miseries self Can make me, or thou thy self couldst wish. Bellinda's murtherer? Eup. Yet killing of me thou might'st add unto thy crime. Phi. But it would take from thine By killing me. Eup. If thou knowest no better way To die, than by my hand, I wish thee no Greater punishment than still to live: The Sword is Angers weapon, faint-hearted Coward, Grief has a keener one, if thou canst find it out. Phi. Thou advisest well, a single death Suffices not for Philanders crime indeed, And I shall but redouble it, by seeing of her die. SCENE VI. Philostrates, Philena, Chorus to them, &amp;c. Philos. That a Nymph so fair and young Should rush thus voluntarily upon A sacrilegious Oath, and so incur Her own destruction, 's a folly and rashness to Be expiated equally with a prodigy.â Go let a Sacrifice presently be prepar'd, T'appease the angry Deity. Phile. Too much of Blood We have already, the water of mine Eyes Shall furnish out the rest of sacrifice; As who's so hard-hearted, so avaritious Of sorrow and grief, he wou'd not spare a tear From all calamities, to spend it here? But see Euphanes. Now still and still D'ye persever ill-advised Youth to love, Where y'are not lov'd, and prefer Bellinda's Falshood to Philena's Truth? Eup. Thy heart then never by experience it seems did prove, Only to love where w'are belov'd again Is bargain, and not Love,â And what, silly Nymph, avails it you Toward the obtaining of Euphanes love, that Bellinda's false, Who but collects from thence, no woman can be true? Philost. Bring forth our sable robes, and let The Executioner with the fatal Ax Be ready against the hour expires. Mysti. Behold 'um here. Phil. Then whilst we vest us all in solemn black, Let Musick make a Funeral doleful moan, For her, whose sad disaster moves the very Rocks Unto compassion. Chorus sings. Wo to what we vertuous call, Wo to fair and sweet withall, Since she must dye who was 'um all. Let 'um seek in all their story They shall find she was their glory, Oh! what heart then is not sorry? Come Musick with thy doleful tones, Come Sorrow with thy sighs and groans, And assist our grievous moans. Since all love had of sweet and fair, All the world of good and rare, Is to perish now with her. SCENE VII. Polydor, with Bellinda veyl'd, &amp;c. to them. Pol. Room, room before there. Eup. She comes, she comes; now to declare A Resolution great as its causes are, Dar'st thou Philander, when her death we see, Resolve to die with me? Philan. For my resolve Euphanes, never fear, I wll not say to die with you, but her. Philos. Now unveil her, whilst thus it is with pain, with his Wand he uncharms her. O open the port of speech, Shortly by deaths hand to be clos'd up again. Bel. Ha! what means this deadly Tragick spectacle, This Funeral Livery, &amp; those bloody Ensigns of cruel And abhorred death! is there any thing can be In Philanders presence able to frighten me?â Eup. How's this? Bel. She runs &amp; embraces him, and he looks strangely on her. Ha! he unkindly reject me, Nay then away with all These deadly preparations, The shadows of death it self, The Axe and th'Executioner too, For one unkind look of Philander's Can kill me sooner than all the rest can do. Philos. Thy Falshood Nymph makes him behold thee so, Occasioning all this affliction and woe, To swear thou lov'dst one here, betroth'd before Unto another. Bel. And what else should I swear, embraces him agen. Beholding my betroth'd Philander here? When passing along to take the sacred Oath And hearing of his voice amid'st the Throng I glanc'd mine eyes aside, And instantly espi'd My dear Philander, For Lovers are quick sighted, Though Love be blind. Pol. Error of Humane minds How were we all deceiv'd then. Philos. [all shout for joy] Strange, but so 'tis in Religious minds, Still in high contemplation Error of humane things is often found, As those who most do contemplate the Stars Do soonest fall to ground. Phila. But that I of all men shou'd be so deceiv'd! Knowing my Bellinda so well, is an Error I Shall ne'r pardon in my self, nor do I know Deerest whe'r thou can'st ever pardon or no. Bel. Well, well. Pol. See how she sweetly nods, and smiling Out th'rest do's seem to say, Well, well Philander, I'll be jealous another day. Philos. Away with these dolefull preparations then, And resume your former joyfull ones agen. Pam. Enter Pamphilus crying Ugh, ugh, ugh, I have lost the best Wife, the best wife, As ever poor Husband hadâBut soft what this? Alive agen! and in anothers Arms! How comes this about? this is fine geer I faith. Fla. Why thou perpetual Doult, Thou unconscionable Asse Thou; mak'st People Kill themselves with laughing at thee, If she'ave Ever been Philander's, both before she arrived here, And since, and now, when should she be thy Wife I prethee? Pam. Why even when she pleases, I am ready for my part. Fla. I dare swear thou art for any one. Pol. See how hand in hand, These happy Lovers stand, So lost in joy for their escape from death, As yet they do not know, Whether they live, or no. Mean time you may perceive By their ey-beams twisted, their fixt regards, Their unmovable posture, and their minds surprize, Ther's nothing glews so fast as Lovers eyes. Philost. O happy pair! Now safely to your Port arrived are; Happy whose former suff'rance and annoy, Does now but heighten more your present joy; Happy, who after y'ave so long On Fortunes rough tempestuous Seas been tost, May truly say, y'ad been lost indeed, Unless you had been lost. Bel. Oh my dearest, and don't my eyes deceive me? she tenderly reclines her head upon his Arm. Phil. My dearest, dearest heart, Come, come, let's go, and take from Love, And Fortune both, the power they had before, Of making us ever miserable more; For yet some farther proof there needs, and some More true and real joy, to let us know, Whe'r that w'enjoy be real, true, or no. Philost. Lead on unto the Temple then, There to conjoyn them by Hymens sacred hands In eternal, and unseparable hands, And as unto the Temple they pass along, Let th'Chorus sing aloud their Nuptial Song. Chorus sings. All the joyes that unto heart, Heav'n &amp; Earth did e'r impart, All the pleasures that the Spring, Or Love, to Youth did ever bring, All contentments too, that e'r Yet in any's bosom were, With a Ravishment to boot, At all parts answerable too't; May blest Hymen all, and more In these Lovers bosoms store, Till satiat with it, they may cry, To pitious heaven, 't wou'd let 'um die, And to a better life translate 'um, Where joys, pleasures, contents ne'er satiate 'um. Exeunt. Manent Philena, Flamette, Euphanes. Fla. And won't you go along? Phile. No Flamette, to a heart And pallat so sad and so out of tast as mine, No Musick, no Feast can relish, and the sight Of others wealth and happiness, wou'd but make me More sensible of mine own poverty and misery; Let them abound with happiness then, and surfet with Deliciousness, I envy not their fortunes, But pity and lament my own. Fla. Excellent sweetness! Heaven's my witness I Heartily pitty her. Phi. But see where Euphanes stands, turn'd musing Statua, Who knows but now may be the fittest time To move my Sute again? to love beyond The possibility or enjoying, is Hope Too far stretcht beyond the end of Love; I'll try then, now Bellinda's love Is probably extinct in him, whether Philena's yet Have any flame to enkindle it again,â Euphanesâ Eup. Hence troublesom and importune,â Out of how profound a slumber, and sweet Reverie has she awak'd me, whilst I imagined With gratefull Error, Philander's happiness Might possibly have been mine own, had Love And Fortune pleas'd,âthe more fool I the whilst, Who with these fancy'd joyes, and imaginary wealth, But feed my Thoughts, whilst I am starv'd my self. Phile. Cruel and pittyless! Is this then all the thanks, And reward I have, for preferring thy Loves Int'rest to my own? and betraying mine own Love, in pleading for thee to Bellinda Against my self? Eup. And what's the effect of it? Phile. Th'ingratefull only judge by the Event, The Gratefull by the Act and the Intent; Thy face belies thy heart, for that is gentle, And full of Love; but with my heart now what Shall I do, since thou, whose 'tis, reject'st it? Wou'd I cou'd gratifie thee with it any wayes, Though I tore it out of my bosom. Eup. Prithee If thou't gratifie me, let me never see thee more. Exit abruptly. Phil. And so perhaps (cruel as thou art,) Thou never shall't; My mind condenses with multitude of thoughts I feel transporting me to somwhat high and braveâ Let's see;âbut for that which we approve our selves, And cann't b' approv'd by others until 't be done, There needs but small deliberation.â Flamette, a word with thee. Exeunt. Finis Actus Quarti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Philena, Flamette, Phi. Flamette, Thou knowst the secrets of every herb and plant, And nothing's in Nature so hidden and abstruse, Thou penetrat'st not with thy skill; Amongst the rest, I remember th'other day, Feeding thy Flocks i'th' pasture there below, And spying suddenly one of thy tender Lambs All-trembling, stretching out its fainting limbs, And closing its dying eyes, thou straight cryedst out A venumous herb had poyson'd it, and bidst Lycisca bear him to the River with all speed, And drive thy Flocks from thence.â Fla. 'Tis true;âand what of this? Phile. Nothing, but the seeing these wondrous effects, Gives me a curiosity to learn of thee A little of thy skill; and to know what herb it is That works so by surprize, it steals away A Life so insensibly, one scarce perceives it,â A friendly office it might do to some, Who weary of living fear not so much to die, As the pains devancing deathâ Fla. Take heed Philena, This is a Curiosity more dangerous Than knowing the cheats of Gaming, by how much life Is more precious than coyn,âand those Who know these tricks, tis fear'd at need will use 'um. Phil. Thou art deceiv'd, they'd rather know them to Avoid them; therefore I prethee tell me What herb 'twas. Fla. If you desire, as you say, to learn my skill, I'll teach you the natures of a hundred More soveraignly vertuous. Phi. Malicious wench! That wilt not understand me. Fla. I fear I understand you but too well. Phi. Must I be put to't then, To discover a secret to thee that concerns My life so nearly? Fla. I, that's it I fear. Phi. Yet why should I dissemble? Dissimulation is child of Fear, And how fearless are those who are resolv'd to dy, Not only of those lesser Tyrants, Want, And Misery, but of those greater, Love, And Fortune, of whom now I quit all my fears, Being Deaths subject, and no longer theirsâ Know then since thou't needs know't, aweary of Repulse upon repulse, aweary of Euphanes scorns, and finally aweary of My wretched being, I am resolved to die. Fla. Ah! far from so gentle a bosom be So cruel thought. Phi. They are rather cruel wou'd divert me from't; Cruel as those wou'd keep poor wretches still Upon the Torture, rather than dispatch their pain. Fla. But d'ye know what 'tis to die? Phi. I know what 'tis to sleep; the afflicted'st ease, Repose o'th' weary, comfort of the distrest, When all our troubles, all our cares do cease; And sleep, and death; but in the length, and the Continuance nothing differ, so as deferring My death, thou but defer'st my happiness, For know Flamette when life is misery, 'tis hapiness to die. Fla. You talk the while As if all were fabulous of the other world, Furies there were none, nothing Their Torments, and no Gods to punish those Impiously leave There stations here on Earth e'r they command. Phi. Troublesome ignorance; those who understand Their Language, the Gods perpetually command: So when we virtue eagerly persue, They bid go on, when we abstain from ill By repentance or avoidance, it is they who still Recall us, or prohibite us, and finally, When we feel in us a desire to leave this life, 'tis they infallibly command us for to die. Fla. But considerâ Phi. Prithee no more consideration; Flamette I ask help, Not counsell of thee, wo't do What I desire? Fla. I'll see. Phi. Nay, who give us doubtfull help, Do but deny us in necessity; Say't shall be done, yet that's too slow, prithee say 'tis done. Fla, Since bootless 'tis to deny you, I'll but run To th'mead, and instantly be here again. [Exit Fla. Phi. Thou shalt find me in the Cipress groveâ So now my minds at ease, and it rejoyces me To think how I shall triumph over Love And Fortune, yet o'r Love for Euphanes sake I'll do't more gently, and not insult too much; but o'r Fortune I'll march in state, while she to her despite shall see't How I'm above her, now tramples me under feet.â But stay, being to divest me of this life, And strait to die, 'tis requisit I make My latest Legacy; first then my sufferance I bequeath To desperat Lovers, my constancy to death, My sighs to th'winds, to th'ocean my tears, To Bellinda my hop'd-for joyes, To Euphanes my memory; and lastly, my hopes and fears To those wou'd live in longer misery; Philena will not; for the rest, All other passions die with us, only Love Accompanies us to th'blest Mansions above. Exit. SCENE II. Pamphilus leering after her. Pam. Iust like a Dogg with's mouth watering at A Frumetty pot had scalded his chops before, I look after these Wenches now, who ar all too hot for me; Besides, that which keeps me most in aw, Is the inkling I have of an odd punishment they have here, To marry unruly Youngsters to old women, just Like Doggs nose, beyond all possibility Of ever heating 'um, and this they call forsooth Mortification, in the Devils name, A good cooler for him, but too cool for me. But see where my quondam wife comes here with her Gallant, Who took her from me, my stomack rises at him,â Scurvy fellow,ânone but my wife serve his turn?â A little thing would make me bumbast him,â If I thought he would not bumbast me agen. Exit Grumbling, and looking spightfully towards Philander SCENE III. Philander, Bellinda. Bel. Nay I could tel you too A hundred other stories, as how the Cabin, Wherein y'ad inclos'd me from seeing The danger of the storm, by a violent wave Being washt away, and driven here on shore, I ever since have only sustain'd my life, With expectation of your arrival here; My dreams, the faint shadows of our waking thoughts, And oftentimes obscure representations Of future Events, being so favourable still, To promise me that happinesse, and your life, Til at last, wearied out with long expectancy, And my six moneths Residence here almost expir'd, I took resolution to abjure the Isle, And depart in search of you, just as you arived here,â Mean time, I'll warrant ye, you ne'r thought of me? Phil. Alas! no sooner I saw Your danger, and was o'th' point (Had I not violently been withheld) To cast my self after you into the Sea, But Pirats making tow'rds us All resistless took us Captives, we paying so At expence of our Liberties the Ransom of our Lives, So straightly guarded the whilst, as till th'other day I was releas'd, (I as soon cou'd tell To send to th'other world, as well As when you were) when repairing to The Oracle, by its directions I found you outâ But tell me, How have you past your time here ever since? And pray, who is that Philena and that Euphanes Y'ave contracted so straight an Amity withall? Bel. O y'ar jealous ar ye?âI could find in my heart I faith To defer answering you, til I had inform'd my self What Mistresses you have had since I saw you lastâ But not to hold you longer in suspense, Know that Philena is a noble Nymph Of Cypres here who when I was cast on shore First found me, and hospitably entertained me, And Euphanes one wou'd needs love me against my Will: To avoid whose importunity, I promis'd if any in the Isle I lov'd It shou'd be him; now are you satisfied? Or shall I bring you all Cypres to testifie How like a Salamander midst of other flames, To all their admirations, I have still lived here as cold as Ice, And yet you are jealous? Phi. Not jealous sweet, but so covetous of the dear Treasure I've in thy Love, as I confess When then prayest in the Temple to the Gods above, I ev'n do grudge 'um part of it. Bel. She inclines her head gently on his bosom. Fie, to those who have given't you all? That is too much Philander,âbut oh my dear What wou'd I have given a few days since for The happiness I now injoy, to which, Through how many miseries have I past? Phil. That, dearest, is it that gives our present joyes The sweeter tast and relish, none being more Happy than those were miserable before; But who are these come here? Bel. Some neighbour Swains it seems, Who in kind expressions of their loves, are come To present us with som Pastoral shew, or Rural masque. SCENE IV. Prologue to them, and divers others, pressing to behold the Pastime, and incompassing Philander and Bellinda, who seat themselves: Polydor, Euphanes, Flamette, entring afterwards. Pro. VVe, whose due Affections move Us to congratulate your Love, Are come in Dance, to personate The Emblem of a Lovers state; As how wav'ring 'twixt Hopes and Fears He stands distracted, till appears The Mistresse of his soul and mind To's love propitiously enclin'd, When Hopes and Fears no more annoy, But are converted all to Joy. The Dance. Expressing in its Figure all that formerly hath been declared under the abstract persons of Hope and Fear, with the Lover, &amp; Fruition &amp; Joy, with his Mistress, all six properly Habited, &amp;c. Fear with doubtfull and trembling pace, Hope more confident; the Lover as he converts himself to th'one or th'other, participating their several Affections, till at the Entrance of his Mistress the Dance changes into a more sprightly Measure; at the end of the Dance, Enter Polydor distractedly, with Flamette. Pol. Can Joy be ne'r sincere, but still some grief Be intermixt, to bitter all its sweets? And is there nothing permanent here below, But all, like th'Sea, perpetually must ebb and flow? Away with all light jollity then, and lets With heavy sorrow prepare to weep again. Bel. Alas! for what? Pol. For poor Philena, who yonder lies A dying, or rather by this time dead, The lamentablest spectacle was ever exhibited On Fortun's Theater! Bel. Alack! alack, the woful day! Pol. to Euph. entring &amp; off'ring to go out agen seeing Philander and Bellinda. Nay, nay, draw nigh, Know you that hand? read there, Cruel as thou art, if thou canst without a tear, And wh? th'ast read it, thou must have a heart of stone Or rather none at all, if't be not mollified with't, By Philena's own hand writ 'twixt tears and blood, Who, after thrice she had cried out on Euphanes Name,âas if't were he, cruel he alone that kill'd her, Poor Gentle soul she dyed. Fla. Cruel, barbarous Euphanes, Nurs'd sure with Tygers milk, if a Tygers self Were not the Damm of thee. Eup. What writes she here? [reads.] Farewel my best Euphanes, from her, who since she cou'd not live thine, chose to die thine at least. Philena. âHum! Fla. Now triumph in your victory, And glory in your triumph, to have slain An innocent Nymph, with scorn and with disdain, So great a glory t'ye, as Euphanes name 'Mongst Nymphs and Virgins shall ever be the mark Of infamy and shame, to shoot their hatreds at. Bel. But why defer we to seek her out, and see If possibly there may be any remedy yet To save her life? Eup. I am awak'd By their reproaches, but much more By somwhat here within, now lets me see I was to blame to use her so cruelly, And now I perceive, for all our corporal and External sight, we nothing see, till Heaven Do give our souls within Internal lightâ And art thou dead for me, for me? O extremity of love, beyond even life it selfâ And shall I nothing do for thee again? I, it shall be so, thou'st got the start Of honour of me, but I may o'retake thee yet. [Exit hastily] Pamphilus. Pam. Not so fast I pray, H'ad like to overthrown me, And I'm little better than overthrown alreadyâfor No Wenches! no Wenches! for love nor money; Tis a hard case, this you'll sayâbut I'm Well enough serv'd, I long'd for change of Pasture, And see what's come on't, I shall return home again nothing But skin and bonesâbut no flesh at all to be gotâ But soft, what's this?â He spies Philena as she is discovered lying dead. What another Moppet? They shall catch me no more I'll warrant 'um, They know what baits to lay for me it seems, And would make a Gudgeon of me, But I'll watch 'um well enough for that. SCENE VI. Philostrates, Mysti, attendants, &amp;c. Phil. A nymph slain in our woods! Unheard of prodigie, there are no savage beasts And much lesse men so savage and barbarous To violate the lives and Honours of our Nymphsâ Stay, is not that she there? alas it is Too true, behold Philena deadâ Pam. Hum Philena, 'tis a strange case this One cannot know the Mopets from the Wenches here, They are all so dead and spiritless. Mysti. Stay! who is that Stands suspitiously there, is't not he has murther'd her? Philos. Ceaze on him, and till he can acquit himself Of the crime, let him stand charg'd with it. Pam. Ah! now I'm paid For my following of Wenches, No warning, no warning wou'd serve my turn, And see what comes on't: Now if I be hang'd, what a goodly exhortation Shall I make, with anâoh good people, Let all young men take warning by me; for This comes of following of Wenches, I've been a wicked liver in my days, And one o'th' greatest Wenchersâand See what't has brought me to, The Gallows, a wry-mouth, a neck as long As a Cranes, and so with a thump on the brest, There'll be an end of Pamphilus. SCENE VII. Bellinda, Philander, Flamette, &amp;c. to them Euphanes after. Bell. I, here she isâ Rest gentle soul, and may nought heavy lie Upon thee, to press thee to the shades beneath, But ever in the Elizian fields among The blessed Quires of Lovers, mayst thou be honor'd, and Adored as Love's Martyr, and in his Kalendar Be ever recorded as a Rubrique Saint; Mean time, upon thy Anniversary day, Each year, we'll pay our vows unto thy Tomb, And to the King and Queen of Shades erect Two grassie Altars, whereon wee'll offer our Libations every year, so as all living Lovers Envying thee, shall wish them dead to have the like Obsequies; and lastly, wee'l Inscribe an Epitaph on thy Sepulcher, In reading which, all passing by shall know, A gentler soul walks not i'th' shades below. Eup. [Enter Euphanes: Room, room, for the most concern'd In this CatastropheâFair sweetest flower, By rigid Winter of Euphanes frowns and scorns Untimely dead, what parentations Shall wretched Euphanes use now, to appease Thy angry Ghost? And with what sad Libations shall I invoke Thy blessed Manes? take here this hair of mine [tears his hair. I offer on thy Tomb; and fairest soul, For ever wayl'd, for ever pitty'd, if Thou't deign to look upon me from the Groves Of fair Elizium, behold, behold Euphanes so strangely metamorphosed Who living lov'd thee not, he now loves thee dead, Thus ready with's life to expiat the crime Which he committed, in being the loss of thine. Fla. offers to kill himself, &amp; is withheld by Flamette. Hold, hold, and know Philena is not dead. Eup. We trifle both,âaway. Fla. I adjure the sacred deity She is not, but only by my Art entranc'd, So deceiving and deluding her despair; In witness of't, besprinkle but her face With water, and you'll see she'll instantly return to life again Eup. Nay, if water may revive her, no other than my tears Shall have the honour of't, [he weeps over her And if those will not do't, I'll let out all my blood on her to boot. Bel. Oh! happy we if this be so. Fla. See, see, she begins to stir already. Pam. Marry and I'm glad on't, for I began to stink With the fright they put me in. Phi. Ha! where am I? in Hell I cannot be Since Euphanes who's my Heaven is here with me, Nor can I be in Heaven, until I know Whe'r Euphanes will be kind to me or no. Eup. Alas, alas, 'tis I rather my dear Philena am In Hell until I know Whe'r thou canst forgive my unkindnes to thee or no. Phi. Nay, if't only does depends on that, There is no fear, I can resolve thee strait, W'ar both in Heaven Euphanes since for me, I do desire no greatet Heaven than thee. Philos. Ioy unto both, and joy then to us all In the accession to our Festival, O'th' glad conjunction of this happy pair, I'th' joy of which each has peculiar share; Let us conduct 'um to their marriage then, And whil'st to th'Temple they are going, Tell 'um this most worth their knowing. Love that tends but too enjoying, Is satiate soon and eas'ly cloying, Only that o'th' Soul still do's Wax perfecter, and more lasting grows. So we compare those light desires, Only unto blazing fires, Whilst these like fire o'th' Element, Last always, and are never spent.â Now what will Bellinda and Philander do? Phi. For us here, where we have found our happiness, We are resolved, better to conserve it, even to remain, And exchange our native Country for this happy soil. Pam. Beshrew me so wo'n't I, For I've enough on't, if there be no Wenches here to be had; Perhaps I may come here again when I'm old, And have a mind to be good. Pol. Mean time who put off goodness to old age, are just like those Who defer their Creditors till all their moneys spent. Philos. to Philander &amp; Bellinda. For you, What should we say then for Conclusion, But y'ar most welcom to Love's Dominion. All. [to the Auditors.] Y'are most welcom to Love's Dominion. [Exeunt Omnes.] FINIS.</field>
