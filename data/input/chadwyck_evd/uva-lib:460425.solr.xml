      <field name="fulltext">DIDO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Dido, Queen of Carthage. Ãneas. Iarbas, King of the Moors, under the name of Arbaces. Selene, Sister to Dido. Araspes, confidant of Iarbas. Osmidas, confidant of Dido.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Carthage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A magnificent hall of audience, with a throne on one side. A prospect of the city of Carthage. Ãneas, Selene, Osmidas. Ãn. No princess, friend, believe not fear or hatred Unmoors the Phrygian fleet and drives me hence: I know that Dido loves me (ah! too well I've prov'd that truth), nor doubt her constant faith. I love and I adore her: gratitude Warms every thought for all her kindness shewn To me, to mine. But destiny commands Once more to expose my life on Neptune's waves. Such is the will of Heaven! Ah me unhappy! The crime of Fate must thus appear my own. Sel. If after wandering long thou seek'st a rest And settled home; 'tis offer'd on this shore: My sister gives, thy merits and our friendship Confirm the wish'd asylum. Ãn. Such asylum Heaven grants not yet. Sel. And wherefore? Osm. By what signs Have the just Gods to you reveal'd their will? Ãn. Osmidas, sleep has never clos'd these eyes, In sweet oblivion, but he brings to view My father's angry shade: âO son! (he cries, âI hear his well-known voice) ungrateful son! âAre these the Italian realms, whose conquest oft âTo thee have PhÅbus and myself enjoin'd? âIll-fated Asia from thy valour hopes âIn other climes renew'd another Troy. âThis didst thou promise, this, in life's last moments âI heard thee swear, when kneeling, on this hand âThy filial kiss confirm'd the solemn compact. âAnd now, ungrateful to thyself, thy country, âThy father, here thou dwell'st in sloth and loveâ âRise, cut the cords that hold thy tardy vessels, âAnd loose thy spreading sails.ââSuch warning given He darts an angry glance and disappears. Sel. I freeze with horror. Osm. If Ãneas leave us I lose in him a rival to the throne. [aside. Sel. [to Ãn.] If you forsake us, hapless Dido dies,â And ah! Selene never can survive. [aside. Osm. The queen approaches. Ãn. Whither shall I turn? Sel. I dare not speak my pains. [aside. Ãn. Be firm my heart, Thy trial comes! [aside. SCENE II. Enter Dido attended. Did. Ãneas, Asia's glory, The care of Venus and of Dido; see How proud, exulting in thy presence here, Our infant Carthage lifts her towering head. Those arches, temples, walls, are all the fruit Of Dido's toils; but thou, Ãneas, thou Art their first boast and noblest ornament. Thou dost not answerâshunn'st meâIs it thus Ãneas meets me with repulsive silence? Perchance some other passion from thy heart Has driven my once-lov'd form. Ãn. The Gods can witness Dido is ever present to my mind: Nor time, nor distance e'er shall shed oblivion (Those Gods alike can witness) o'er my passion. Did. Wherefore these protestations! Dido seeks No vows to bind thy faithâa look, a sigh, Ensures from me belief. Osm. She trusts too far. [aside. Sel. I dare not yet complain. [aside. Ãn. If thou regard'st Thy own repose, think of thyself, thy greatness, And think of me no more. Did. Not think of thee! I that but live for thee! I that enjoy No moment's peace when thou art absent from me? Ãn. O Heaven! what hast thou said? Is this a time For such effusive tenderness? Alas! Too generous for ingratitude like mine! Did. Ingratitude, Ãneas! Is my love Then hateful to thee? Ãn. Never has my soul Confess'd a purer flameâbutâ Did. Speakâ Ãn. My countryâ Heaven's high commandâ Did. Go on. Ãn. I cannot speak it. A thousand warring thoughts in vain My labouring bosom swell: Do thou that fatal cause explain [to Osm. My lips refuse to tell. [Exit. SCENE III. Dido, Selene, Osmidas, attendants. Did. And does Ãneas fly me thus? What means Such cruel silence! how have I offended! Sel. His purpose is to leave theeâLove and Glory With doubtful empire struggle in his heart. Did. And does he find it glory to forsake me? Osm. Now policy assist me! [aside.]âMighty queen! Selene little reads Ãneas' thoughts: Arbaces from the Moorish court is sent Ambassador to Carthage. Did. Well, what follows? Osm. The haughty king demands your hand in marriage. Ãneas fears that you, by force compell'd, Will yield to his demand; and therefore flies To shun the grief to see you wed another. Did. It may be soâgo, dearest sister, chace From my Ãneas such unkind suspicions, And tell him death alone shall tear me from him. Sel. This I must suffer too! relentless fate! [aside. To him thy sister, void of art, Shall make thy purpose known, And sooth to peace thy love-sick heart; [to Did. But rend with grief her own. [aside. To him my faithful lips address'd, Shall all thy thoughts reveal: [to Did. But how, the pangs that rend my breast, Shall I, ye powers! conceal! [aside.] Exit. SCENE IV. Dido, Osmidas, attendants. Did. Now let Arbaces come; whate'er his purpose, A suppliant or a foe, he comes in vain: Before his sight, ere yet the day declines To western skies, the sun shall see this hand Given to Ãneasâhe and he alone Is worthy to possess the heart of Dido: This shall Arbaces know. Osm. Arbaces comes. SCENE V. Enter Iarbas, under the name of Arbaces, with Araspes. A train of Moors; various attendants bringing tigers, lions, and other presents to the Queen. Dido ascends the throne, Osmidas on her right hand: two Carthaginians bring the cushions for the African Ambassador and place them at a distance fronting the throne. Aras. Behold, my kingâ[aside to him, entering. Iar. Be silentâwhile I wear [aside to Aras. A subject's semblance, call me still Arbaces, And be the king forgotâDido, to thee, The sovereign of the Moors deputes Arbaces, His faithful nunciate. At thy choice I bring Thy kingdom's safety or thy kingdom's ruin. The presents here display'd, gems, treasure, captives, And savage beasts, the wealth of subject Afric, He sends, O queen, as pledges of his greatness: Then learn the giver from the gift. Did. Should Dido Accept his gift, the giver's well rewarded; But let him heed, or what he means a gift May prove a tributeâInsolence like this The soul of Dido scorns.â[aside.] Sit then and speak. Aras. What thinks my sovereign? [aside to Iar. Iar. Lovely in her pride! [to himâsits. Remember, Dido, what thou cam'st from Tyre, What desperate fortune drove thee to these shores; 'Twas Afric only gave thee rest and safety From thy inhuman brother's impious thirst Of wealth and blood: this ample space, where now Aspiring Carthage rises, was the gift Of my great master's hand: Iarbasâ Did. Hold! Thou dost confound a purchase with a gift. Iar. First let me speak and then reply. Did. What boldness! [to Osm. Osm. Let him proceed. [to Did. Iar. My courteous king, Iarbas, Sought thee in marriage, and refus'd, endur'd The unworthy slight, because thy widow's vows Were then devoted to SichÃ¦us' ashes, All Afric now has heard that from the ruins Of Asia's kingdom here Ãneas found From thee a welcome, that thy heart is given To him; nor will the sovereign of the Moors Permit a wandering exile, 'scap'd from Troy, To rival him in love. Did. His love and hate To me are equal. Iar. Let me first conclude, Then may'st thou answer. Know my generous king Instead of war has sent to offer peace. Act as thou wiltâforgetful of the past, He seeks thy love, demands to share thy nuptials, And asks with these Ãneas' forfeit head. Did. Hast thou yet finish'd? Iar. I have finish'd. Did. Know To Lybian sands I came from regal Tyre For freedom not for bondage. Carthage stands My treasure's purchase, not thy monarch's gift. When to Iarbas I refus'd my hand, And widow'd heart, I meant to keep my faith To dead SichÃ¦usâDido now is chang'dâ Far other thoughtsâ Iar. Since Dido now has chang'dâ Did. First let me answer, then Arbaces, speak. Yes, Dido now is chang'dâ'tis wisdom oft To vary thoughts with timeâÃneas' worth Has touch'd my heart; his valour shall support My rising throne, and marriage make us one. Iar. But first his headâ Did. His head will prove a conquest Not lightly gain'dâthis exile scap'd from Troy May give the sovereign of the Moors such toil, He yet but little fears. Iar. Should'st thou provoke My king's resentment, soon expect to see Against thee Afric pour her numerous sons, From Garamantia and Getulia's plains, And hot Numidia's confines. Did. Let Ãneas But own my cause, and Afric pour her sons From Garamantia and Getulia's plains, From hot Numidia's clime, and all the world Conspire against my empire. Iar. Shall I then Report this answer? Did. Thou mayst say that Dido Heeds not the soothing of Iarbas' love, Nor fears his indignation. Iar. Still reflectâ Think better, Dido. Did. I have thought enough. [both rise. A queen and lover Dido reigns, And in her heart and throne maintains A right, all rights above. In vain he seeks her soul to awe, Who to her will would give the law, In glory or in love. [Exit attended. SCENE VI. Iarbas, Araspes, Osmidas. Iar. Araspes, vengeance.â [going. Aras. Where thou lead'st I follow. Osm. Arbaces, stay. Iar. What can he seek with me? [to Aras. Osm. May I at will confer with thee? Iar. Speak on. Osm. If thou wilt make me partner of thy counsels, Receive my profferr'd aid. The queen intrusts me; Ãneas ranks me for his friend; the troops Wait on my nod, and ample power is mine To forward thy designs. Iar. And who art thou? Osm. A follower of the Tyrian queen, Osmidas, In Cyprus was I born, and boast a mind Above my humble fortune. Iar. I accept Thy profferr'd aid, and if I find thee faithful, Whate'er thou wishest, be thy bright reward. Osm. Let Dido be thy sovereign's, and to me Be yielded then the government of Carthage. Iar. I plight my faith it shall be thine. Osm. But will Thy sovereign's power confirm the mighty grant? Iar. The king bestows it when Arbaces gives. Osm. Thenâ Iar. Every little act may breed suspicion: Reserve thy counsels for some fitter place Retir'd from noticeâOn my faith rely, Whene'er Iarbas weds, Osmidas reigns. Osm. Disclose each plan thy soul revolves, My zeal shall second thy resolves, Thy hopes, thy vengeance aid: So murmuring through the verdant meads, A stream its gentle current leads, With genial power a sapling feeds, Whose branches deck the glade. [Exit. SCENE VII. Iarbas, Araspes. Iar. Vain, easy fool! to hope such promise given Would find from me performance. Aras. Yet, my sovereign, Your sacred word is past. Iar. Who keeps not faith To others, merits not himself to find it. Go, lov'd Araspes, all delay is torture To rage like mineâgo, let one blow from thee Secure my vengeanceâlet Ãneas die. Aras. I goâand fate shall soon in open combat Decide between our valour. [going. Iar. Stay, Araspes, Let not thy fame, my hatred and my vengeance, Be left to chance like thisâfraud shall assist us; Assail him unprovided. Aras. Fraud! my sovereign? A subject was I born, but never yet Have earn'd the name of traitorâBid me run, Naked through flames, expose to hostile arms This fenceless breast,âI'll fearless dare them all, Thou art the master of my lifeâAraspes Shrinks from no trial to defend his king; But, Oh! exact not from this sword a deed That bears the stamp of treason. Iar. Fond delusion Of vulgar mindsâI shall not want an arm More faithful found than thine. Aras. How! mighty Gods! Thy virtue sureâ Iar. What virtue? In the world Virtue is but a name, or that alone Is virtue, which secures our weal or pleasure. Amidst a throne's resplendent blaze Each action stands approv'd; Deceit itself may claim our praise, And guilty deeds be lov'd. To shun by guile some threaten'd ill, Let dastard spirits dread, Who born in fetters, cherish still The fears in bondage bred. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Araspes alone. O impious doctrine! canst thou then, unhappy, Be stranger to the feelings of remorse, Remorse that follows even successful guilt; Nor know the peace that virtue gives misfortune? O! thou the world's support! the glorious boast Of men and Gods, fair Virtue, lead me still. If thou direct not through the deep (Bright star of Heaven!) my tossing ship, No calm this restless bosom knows. On thee in danger I confide, In adverse fate thy counsels guide, From thee alone I find repose. [Exit. SCENE IX. A court-yard. Selene, Ãneas. Ãn. Already have I told you, fair Selene, That ill Osmidas has explain'd my thoughts. Ah! would to Heaven that Dido were unfaithful, Or that I could one moment, self-deceiv'd, Believe her faithless to me!âBut to know That still she loves Ãneas, that compell'd I yet must leave herâthis, indeed, is torture! Sel. Whatever cause constrains you to depart At least defer the parting: bend your steps To Neptune's hallow'd fane, my sister there Demands a moment's audience. Ãn. Dreadful pause! Sel. First hear her, then depart. Ãn. And shall I take A last farewell of all my soul adores! Sel. Can I be silent still and live? [aside. Ãn. Selene, You weep. Sel. Ah! can I hear you, yet restrain The sympathizing tear? Ãn. Forbear your sighs, 'Tis Dido should alone lament my going. Sel. One heart, alas! myself and Dido bear. Ãn. Do you so nearly feel a sister's sorrow? Sel. She lives in me, and I so live in her, That all the afflictions she endures, are mine. Ãn. Most generous maid! I pity your distress, And in your sorrows, half forget my own. Sel. O! could you read my heart, you truly then Might feel for poor Selene. SCENE X. Enter Iarbas and Araspes. Iar. I have search'd The palace round, nor yet can find Ãneas. Aras. Perchance he sails from Carthage. Iar. Would yon warrior [sees Ãn. Were him I seek.âHe seems not by his garb Of Afric's sonsâWhat art thou, stranger? Say. [to him. Aras. O how her beauty strikes my ravish'd eyes! [looking at Sel. Ãn. Lovely Seleneâ [looking at Sel. Iar. Sure, thou hear'st me not. [to Ãn. Ãn. O! too, too feeling for another's woes! [to Sel. Sel. What arrogant deportment! [looking at Iar. Aras. Heavens! how fair! [looking at Sel. Iar. Declare thy name, or nowâ [to Ãn. Ãn. What right hast thou To make this proud demand, or what to thee Imports my name or birth? Iar. To me, my will Is all the right I seek. Ãn. It is not here Our wont to answer madmen. [going. Iar. Answer then This trusty weapon. [about to draw. Sel. In Selene's sight! In Dido's palace such presumptuous bearing! Iar. And does an envoy from Iarbas claim No more respect? Sel. The queen shall learn this outrage. Iar. This let her learn, and in her own despite Behold me lop yon traitor's daring head, And join'd with that of her Ãneas, cast it Before the feet of my offended king. Ãn. The deed may prove more arduous than thy fond O'erweening hopes presage. Iar. Wilt thou oppose it? Or that Ãneas, who, for glories won, Recounts his past defeats? Ãn. Yet know, proud man, Thy boasted victories, in glory's scale, May yield to his defeats. Iar. And who art thou, That dar'st for him provoke me? Ãn. I am one, Let this suffice, who holds thy wrath in scorn. When thou my hidden name shalt hear Thy haughty soul may learn to fear, Thy tongue each boast forget. The passenger, whose headstrong will Against his pilot's better skill, Insensate quits the peaceful shore, Will soon, when angry tempests roar, The safer land regret. [Exit. SCENE XI. Iarbas, Selene, Araspes. Iar. Thou shalt not 'scape me thusâ [going. Sel. What would'st thou? Say. [detaining him. Iar. Give me his name. Sel. Be calmâ And learn it then from me. Iar. I ask no more. Sel. Know'st thou that stranger, whom thy rage insulted, Is him thou seek'stâÃneas? Iar. Thou hast robb'd me Of great revenge, forbid this hand to reap Those honours which indulgent Heaven prepar'd. Sel. Whence all this anger? How has he, Arbaces, Offended thee? Iar. He with my sovereign dares Contend for Dido's love, and canst thou ask In what I am offended? Sel. Think'st thou then That every lover can elect at will The heart's dear object? Ah! thou little know'st, Arbaces yet, the wayward school of love. [Exit. SCENE XII. Iarbas, Araspes. Iar. Iarbas shall no longer lurk conceal'd, Araspes, I've already borne too much. Aras. What would you then? Iar. I'll summon all my warriors At my arrival in the wood conceal'd, And lead them to the palace; hurl destruction On hated Carthage; tear my rival's heart From his detested breastâ SCENE XIII. Enter Osmidas in haste. Osm. My lord, already The queen prepares to visit Neptune's temple; If you delay, even now, before your sight, She to the haughty Trojan gives her hand. Iar. Presumptuous daring! Osm. 'Tis no longer time For vain complaints. Iar. What counsel now remains? Osm. The speediest is the bestâmyself will leadâ Be boldâin every enterprise Osmidas Will be your buckler and support. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Iarbas, Araspes. Aras. My lord, [to Iar. going. Ah! whither would you run? Iar. To slay my rival. Aras. Alas! what means? Your warriors know not yet Their leader's will. Iar. If force should fail, deceit Shall lend its aid. Aras. And would you purchase vengeance With treachery's impious stain? Iar. My love, Araspes, Emboldens thee too far; I rather wish thee More prompt to vigorous act, and slow to counsel: Think what Iarbas is, and what Araspes. A flood am I, that, swell'd with rains, With snows and waters, o'er the plains Bears woods and herds and cots and swains, While nothing can oppose its course. If narrow banks the torrent bind, It bursts the bed, and unconfin'd, Resistless roars with double force. [Exit with Aras. SCENE XV. The temple of Neptune, with an image of the God. Ãneas and Osmidas. Osm. Then from your lips shall wretched Dido learn Your purpose to forsake her? O! for pity Refrain, and spare her heart such rending sorrow. Ãn. 'Tis cruelty to speak, but to conceal it Were more than treason. Osm. Constant to your purpose, Yet at her tears I trust it soon will change. Ãn. My grief may end my life, but cannot make me Deaf to my country's call, my father's honour. Osm. Exalted prince! the first of heroes he, Whose virtue can subdue himself. Ãn. Alas! How dear is such a conquest! SCENE XVI. Enter Iarbas and Araspes. Iar. [to Aras.] See my rival, And unaccompanied. Aras. Think what you are. Iar. [to Aras.] Follow me and be silentâ Thus my wrongsâ [going to strike Ãneas, is prevented by Araspes; the dagger drops from his hand and is taken up by Araspes. Aras. O! holdâ Iar. [to Aras.] Ah! traitor! thus to aid my foe! Ãn. What would thy impious fury? [to Aras. seeing the dagger in his hand. Osm. All is lost! SCENE XVII. Enter Dido, attended. Osm. O queen! we are betray'd, and if Arbaces Had here delay'd his succour, great Ãneas This day had fallen beneath a barbarous hand. Did. Where is the base assassin? Osm. See him there, The murderous weapon in his grasp. [pointing to Aras. Did. What fury Enflam'd thy bosom to the treacherous deed? Aras. My sovereign's glory and my own renown. Did. How! did Arbaces disavowâ Aras. I know itâ He reprobates the deedâI fear his anger, But never can my conscious soul repent What is not guilt. Did. And feel'st thou no remorse For such a sacrilege? Aras. A thousand times Would I repeat the daring. Did. I'll prevent theeâ Guards, take him henceâ [Exit Aras. guarded. Ãn. [to Iar.] O! generous foe! I knew not In thee such virtue dweltâcome to my breast. Iar. Ãneas, holdâAraspes sav'd thy lifeâ I sought thy bloodâin me behold Iarbas! Did. Iarbas, thou! Ãn. Thou sovereign of the Moors! Did. A kingly bosom harbours not such baseness: Thou dost belie thy princeâDisarm the traitor. Iar. None dare approach me. [draws.] Death is in this weapon. Osm. [aside to Iar.] Seem but to yield awhile, till time permit To call our friends in aidâIn me confide. Iar. Can I submit so tamely. [aside to Osm. Ãn. Hold, my friends, 'Tis mine to punish him. Did. [to Ãn.] Reserve thy valour For nobler deedsâ [to Iar.] What canst thou hope? Or yield, Or fall a bloody victim at my feet. Osm. Reserve thee for a future noble vengeance. [aside to Iar. Iar. Thereâtake my sword. [throws down his sword, which is taken up by the guards.âExit Iarbas guarded, followed by Osmidas and Araspes. SCENE XVIII. Dido, Ãneas. Did. Ãneas, thou art safe: The Gods for me preserve a life so precious. Ãn. O Heaven! my queenâ Did. Again dost thou retain A doubt of Dido's truth? Ãn. O no!âmy fate Is far more wretchedâI must leave thee, Dido. Did. Leave me! what fatal cause? Ãn. The will of Jove, My father's shade, my country, Heaven's command, My faith, my duty, honour, empire, all Now summon me to tread the Italian shores: My long delay too much offends the Gods. Did. And hast thou then, perfidious! till this hour Conceal'd thy cruel purpose? Ãn. O! 'twas pity. Did. Pity! thy lips had sworn me endless truth When thy false heart prepar'd to part for ever! Whom shall I trust again?âA wretched outcast Of winds and waves, receiv'd upon my coast,â I gave him welcome from the seas; refitted His scatter'd fleet and arms; with him I shar'd My heart and throneâand ah! as this were little, For him I have provok'd a hundred kings, That profferr'd me their loveâLo! such reward Has faith like mineâAh! whom, unhappy Dido, Whom shalt thou trust again? Ãn. O! while I live Thy name shall be the solace of my thoughts: O! never, Dido, would I quit these shores Had not the will of Heaven decreed my toils, To raise another realm in Latian climes. Did. The Gods indeed have then no other care Than great Ãneas' fate. Ãn. And would'st thou then Ãneas should, by still remaining here, Incur the guilt of perjury? Did. O no: Thus would thy offspring lose in future times The world's great empire.âGo, pursue thy fortune; Goâseek the Italian realmsâto winds and waves Intrust thy hopesâbut know that righteous Heaven Shall make those waves my ministers of vengeance. Then shalt thou late repent thy fond belief In raging elementsâthen shalt thou call, But call in vain on Dido. Ãn. Could'st thou read My secret thoughtsâ Did. Away and leave me, traitor! Ãn. At least, with gentler aspect, from my lips Receive the last farewell. Did. Leave me, ingrate! Ãn. And yet my wretched fate, alas! deserves not From Dido such reproaches. Did. Hence, thou false-one! Have I not cause to accuse my fate? To mourn a heart by thee, ingrate! With every grief opprest? Perfidious man! for love so true, Thou know'st if such reward was due: Ye souls! like me unblest! Ah! say, what pangs can mortals know, If what I feel bespeaks not woe That deepest rends the breast. [Exit attended. SCENE XIX. Ãneas alone. And shall I make thee then such base return, For truth like thine? Such love, such gifts unequall'd? Noâere my heart consents to leave thee thus, First perish Italy and all the world! Let blank oblivion hide my fame for ever, And Troy once more be sunk in smouldering ashes! âAlas! what have I said!âO mighty father! Forgive the ravings of a lover's follyâ 'Twas not Ãneas spokeâO death to glory!â Haste, let us goâMust then the insulting Moor Infold her beauties in his arms?âO! never!â But shall the son meantime forgetting all His filial ties be perjur'd to his sire? O! give me counsel, Gods! In this extreme, Love, jealousy, a father's angry shade, And Heaven's high mandates rend my warring soul. Whether my ships are moor'd at land, Or sails are stretch'd in air, Cruel and false on either hand, A like reproach I bear. Meanwhile with dreadful doubts oppress'd, That harrow deep my labouring breast, I still my flight delay. I dare not quit, nor keep the shore, But, ah! with equal pangs deplore My parting or my stay! [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A royal apartment, a table and seats. Selene, Araspes. Sel. What hand has loos'd the rude barbarian's chains? Aras. I know not, fair Selene; I behold Myself a prisoner, guilty; then again In freedom and absolv'd; in one short moment Araspes freed, his sovereign lord in bonds: Through all the palace anxious now I seek him, And find Selene. Sel. Ah! some secret treason Is fram'd against ÃneasâO! Araspes, Preserve the hero's life. Aras. He is my foe: But if you ask Araspes to defend him From hidden fraud, thus far I plight my faith; My honour here will prove his firmest guard: Thus much must yet suffice. Sel. It shall suffice. [going. Aras. Ah! take not from my eyes so soon the joy To view Selene's charms. Sel. What means Araspes? Aras. Alas! I know I should conceal my passion; But if I err, Selene, to yourself Impute the crime of love. Sel. I own, Araspes, Thy valour, virtue, all that claims regard From woman's sexâbut, ah! another flame Has warm'd Selene's heart. Aras. Ah me, unhappy! Sel. Yet more, Araspesâif these feeble charms Have touch'd thy breast, at least disclose thy pains, I'll hear and pity themâbut ah! Selene Cannot conceal, yet dares not own her secret. Aras. Yet let me here devote my constant faith. Sel. Thus much I grant, but ne'er expect return: If thou canst love me on this hard condition, I take thy loveâbut ne'er aspire to more. Aras. My heart, on this condition, plights its truth. Sel. For me thy faithful love retain, Thy bosom bear the shaft in vain; But ne'er to me henceforth complain Of unrewarded love. My constant heart and thine must share An equal portion of despair: No hope must ever sooth thy care, Nor I compassion prove. [Exit. Araspes alone. Thou bid'st me never hope, but bid'st in vain; Hope is the gleam that cheers the parting soul. [Exit. SCENE II. Dido with a paper, Osmidas. Did. I know that under feign'd Arbaces' name The sovereign of the Moors here lurks conceal'd: But be it as it may, he injures Dido, And king or subject he shall pay the forfeit. He dies without reprieve. Osm. Whate'er thy will, Behold in me your faithful minister. Did. Thy loyalty shall find its due reward. Osm. And what reward, O queen? In vain my valour And loyalty are yours, while in your heart Ãneas rules alone the sovereign lord. Did. No moreânor call to mind that hated name, Perfidious and ingrate! A soul that knows No law nor compactâI detest myself For loving him so long. Osm. Should you again Behold him, he would sooth each angry thought. Did. Again behold him? Think not this deceiver, While Dido lives, shall ever see me more. SCENE III. Enter Selene. Sel. Ãneas sues for audience, if my queen Vouchsafe to admit him. Did. Heavens! Ãneas! where, Where, my Selene? Sel. He attends at hand, And sighs impatient to behold his queen. Did. Rash man!âbut let him enterâthou, Osmidas, Awhile retire. [Exit Sel. Osm. Did I not well foresee it? Ãneas rules at will the heart of Dido. Did. Distract me not in vainâOsmidas, leave me. [Exit Osm. SCENE IV. Enter Ãneas. Did. Not yet departed? Does the great Ãneas Still deign to honour Lybia's barbarous shores? I thought, already crost the furthest waves, He now, a victor in Italian climes, Had dragg'd in triumph, at his chariot wheels, Whole nations bound in chains and captive kings. Ãn. Such harsh reproaches, O! too lovely queen, But ill beseem your gentlenessâI come Anxious to guard your honour and my own. I know you mean to punish with his death The Moor's presumptuous pride. Did. Behold his sentence. [shews the paper. Ãn. Glory permits not I should thus revenge My private wrongsâif you for me condemn him. Did. For thee condemn him? Thou art too much deceiv'd: Past is that time, Ãneas, when on thee Was Dido's every thoughtâthat flame is quench'd; Those chains are broken; scarce remembrance now Recalls thy name. Ãn. Reflectâthe seeming envoy Is sovereign of the Moors. Did. Whate'er he be, I know him notâto me he is Arbaces. Ãn. O! Heaven! his death against your state would raise All Afric's powers in arms. Did. I ask not counsel: Guard thou thy kingdom, Dido guards her own Without thy arm. I gave my Carthage laws, And saw, without thy help, her rising towers. Bless'd had I been if thou, ungrateful man, Hadst never reach'd these shores. Ãn. If Dido's soul Despise the peril, grant his life to me; Let me entreat his pardon. Did. Dido sure Must owe her kingdom and herself, her all To thy transcendent meritsâTo a lover Loyal as thee; a hero so renown'd For filial piety; to prayers so just, To such a pleader what shall be denied? [goes to the table. Inhuman! tyrant! on this day, the last We e'er perhaps may meet, thou now art come To speak but of Arbaces; Dido claims No more thy care.âO! had I seen thine eyes But moisten'd with a tear!âDo I not merit A look, a sigh, some little mark of pity? And yet thou dar'st to plead another's pardon! Shall I reward thee for thy cruelty? Since thou would'st have him live he surely dies. [signs the paper. Ãn. My soul's best treasure still! for such thou art, In spite of rigorous fate. Ah! what avails With mutual tenderness to wake anew Your slumbering griefâif yet your heart retain Some little thought for this forlorn of men, Appease your anger, and revoke the sentence. Ãneas begs itâhe whom Dido once Pronounc'd her chiefest good, and whom, till now, She priz'd beyond her life and regal throne; And he whom onceâ Did. Enoughâthou hast subdu'd meâ Receive this paperâSee, ungrateful man, [gives him the paper. How Dido still adores thee; with one look Thou hast disarm'd herâall defence is lost; And wilt thou yet betray meâyet forsake me? Ah! hear me yet, in pity hear, Nor wretched Dido leave: Where shall she meet with truth sincere, If you her truth deceive? Of you my last farewell to take, To tear you from my breast, I fear my wretched heart must break, With countless woes oppress'd. [Exit. Ãneas alone. I feel my constancy begin to fail Before such wondrous truth; and while I seek To save another I myself am lost. SCENE V. Enter Iarbas. Iar. What means the great Ãneas? Still I see His face impress'd with marks of recent fear. Ãn. Iarbas loos'd from bonds! Who set thee free? Iar. Osmidas gave me leave to range at large The palace walls; but, to secure thy safety, Without my trusty sword. Ãn. Does thus Osmidas Betray his sovereign's charge? Iar. What fears Ãneas? Lest I should steal in secret from these walls? O no! I rather shall remain too long For thy security. Ãn. Thy present fortune Excites Ãneas' pity, not his fear. Iar. Indeedâthy mighty heart may spare its pity: Goâto my ruin, o'er a queen and lover Exert thy power; inflame her angry soul To rage: such arms as these alone are us'd By Phrygian heroes to revenge their wrongs. Ãn. Read thereâin that the royal dame has sign'd, With her own hand, the mandate for thy death. And were Ãneas one of Afric's sons, Iarbas were no moreâtake this and learn Discourteous, rude barbarian! how Ãneas Revenges injuries by him receiv'd. [tears the paper and gives it to Iar. Exit. SCENE VI. Iarbas alone. Unheard of, strange adventure! from my foe I meet with pity, from my subject falsehood! Ah! both perhaps conspire against my peaceâ But be it as it mayâmy haughty rival May feign compassion, or my friend be false, Iarbas' soul shall never harbour fear. Let clouds obscure the light of day, Or Sol redeem his flashing ray, My constant heart feels no dismay, But still unchang'd remains. Even from my birth inur'd to dare, No fortune claims Iarbas' care, Who every foe disdains. [Exit. SCENE VII. A hall. Ãneas alone. 'Twixt love and duty in my doubtful breast My heart still fluctuates, while, alas! my virtue Submits too far to beauty's sovereign sway. Rouse, rouse thyself and let the hero now Subdue the lover. SCENE VIII. Enter Araspes. Aras. Till this hour in vain I have sought thee through the palace. Ãn. Let me now Embrace my friendâ Aras. Awayâbehold in me Thy foe, Ãneas; draw thy sword this instant; I seek not friendship with thee, but the exchange Of enmity, with arms oppos'd to arms. Ãn. Thou first hast sav'd me from Iarbas' fury; Thou call'st me now to meet in mortal strife, And spurn'st my profferr'd friendship. Aras. Thou art deceiv'd. I but defended then my monarch's glory, And not Ãneas' lifeâprepare thee now With nobler death to give that just revenge Which late my arm denied him. Ãn. Shall Ãneas Against his brave preserver draw the sword? Aras. Ha! wherefore dost thou pause? Ãn. My life is thine: Take, if thou wilt, the gift thyself bestow'd; But hope not, generous warrior, e'er to see My weapon rais'd against thee. Aras. If thy hand Refuse to draw, expect to hear each insult That brands the vile and cowardâ Ãn. 'Tis too muchâ Ãneas never can submit to bear Such threats as ill beseem a warrior's ear; Thou shalt be satisfied. Behold my sword Brandish'd against theeâbut let Gods and men Be witness first to what my tongue declares: I am Araspes' friend, and to his gift I owe my life; that now reluctant, urg'd Beyond my heart's best feelings, and debas'd With infamous reproach, I dare the combat; And sacrifice my gratitude to honour. [fight. SCENE IX. Enter Selene. Sel. Such boldness in the palace? hold, Araspes, Thus to Selene wilt thou keep thy faith? And thus, O traitor, guard Ãneas' life? Ãn. No, princess, never yet Araspes' bosom Could harbour treason. Sel. He, who serves Iarbas, Can never sure be faithful. Aras. Fair Selene, You only dare accuse me. Sel. Peace, and leave me. Aras. With silent awe I bend to thee, But, ah! thou wrong'st my truth, on me To fix a traitor's stain. Far, far, be hence my steps address'd, Yet soon, I trust, thy gentle breast, Will mourn its past disdain. [Exit. SCENE X. Ãneas, Selene. Ãn. When late Araspes dar'd me to the fight He fought his monarch's cause; and if Selene Would now condemn him, she condemns unjustly A noble heart. Sel. Whate'er Araspes be, I waste not time on himâDido requires A converse with thee. Ãn. But even now I left The queen's apartment; if she hope again To stay my steps on these forbidden shores, She will but torture both with fruitless pain. Sel. How canst thou, O thou dear one! thus forsake A wretched queen that loves thee? Ãn. How Selene! To me? Sel. 'Tis Dido, not Selene speaks. Ãn. If pity for a sister thus afflict you, Think not of meâto her once more return: O! bid the beauteous mourner yet have comfort, Submit to fate and banish fruitless sorrow, Sel. Ah! noâyet change thy purpose, yet relent, âMy life's best treasure! Ãn. Ha! Is this Selene? Sel. 'Tis Dido, not Selene speaksâconsent To hear her yetâ'tis all she now implores. Ãn. 'Tis thus that lovers still deceive themselves, And seeking comfort, find but new despair. Of every pang the bosom bears, Most wretched lovers find The moment that asunder tears Two hearts in one intwin'd. What souls, by love's soft passion mov'd, Can bear this stroke of woe? This, if Selene ne'er has prov'd, Ah! may she never know. [Exit. SCENE XI. Selene alone. O fond Selene! O unhappy maid! For whom dost thou indulge a hopeless flame? My peace is lost!âBut who, alas! compels me To sigh in vain?âThen choose some other heart More grateful to thy vows, some other lover Worthy thy loveâO Heaven! it is not ours To fix the choiceânor is it grace, nor beauty, Nor inbred worth, nor valour that awakes The seeds of loveâah! noâwe find the worthless Too often priz'd, while, partial to its choice, The blindfold passion forms ideal charms. Each lover thinks that secret charms Must give him first the soft alarms, That merit only points the arms That pierce the lover's heart. But oft no charms or merits fire; 'Tis but some start of wild desire, That thus the bosom can inspire, Which blindly hugs the dart. [Exit. SCENE XII. A closet with seats. Dido alone. I'll live no longer doubtful of my fate: 'Tis now the last important time, once more To prove Ãneas.âSince my prayers, my sufferings Have fail'd to move his pity, jealousy May search the deep recesses of his heart, And from its ashes wake the smother'd flame. SCENE XIII. Enter Ãneas. Ãn. I come, O queen! to hear your last reproaches: I know you mean to call me false, perfidious, Ingrate, unworthy, perjur'dâevery name That anger dictatesâI deserve them all. Did. O! noâno longer I'm incens'dâno more I call thee perjur'd, falseânor seek I now To bring our past endearments to remembrance. I ask Ãneas' counsel not his love: Be seated and attend. [they sit. Ãn. [aside.] What would the queen? Did. Thou seest, Ãneas, how unnumber'd foes Begirt my growing empire; till this hour I scorn'd their threats and furyâbut Iarbas By me provok'd, when I shall lose thy succour, Will take, for his revenge, my life and throne. In such distressful state all help is vainâ What then remains? I must encounter death, Or give this hand to appease the haughty Moor. Fatal alternative! I know not where To fix my choiceâaloneâa feeble womanâ Far from my native soilâAlas! I feel My spirits sink, unequal to the trial: Then wonder not, Ãneas, that my soul Still unresolv'd requests thy friendly counsel. Ãn. And is there then no other way but death, Or this detested Hymen? Did. Ah! too sure One other way remainsâ Ãn. Sayâ Did. Had Ãneas Disdain'd not to receive my plighted faith, Then had I seen, from furthest Araby To Atlas' waves, all Afric bend the knee To adore their queen in Carthageâthen renew'd, Might Troy and Tyre unitedâbut I rave! And feign impossibilitiesâthen say, What course befits me?âWith a mind unshaken Shall Dido now Iarbas choose or death? Ãn. Iarbas choose or death! and mine the task To counsel thee! her, whom my soul adores, To see her in a hated rival's arms, Her whomâ Did. No moreâsince thus my nuptials pain thee, I here disclaim themâbut to save her fame, Herself from insult, Dido must not live. Draw, draw thy sword, and pierce this constant bosom; Such cruelty were mercyâ Ãn. Shall Ãneas Then murder Dido! first let angry Heaven Rain all its vengeanceârather may the Gods Take from my days of life and add to thine! Did. Then let me wed Iarbas. Ãn. Yet reflectâ Too much, O Heaven, thou heed'st Ãneas' peace. Did. Then take my life. Ãn. Noâlet us yield to fateâ Give to Iarbasâgive thy royal handâ Do thou but live and let Ãneas never Know peace or comfort more. Did. Since thou canst wish To see me wed another, thou shalt find Thy wish completedâcall Iarbas hither. Thou seest thy power o'er Dido. [an attendant enters, and having received the order departs.] Ãn. O! farewell. [going. Did. Say, whither goest thou? Stayâthou must remain A witness of these happy nuptial ritesâ [to Ãn. He cannot long resistâ [aside. Ãn. Be firm, my heart! SCENE XIV. Enter Iarbas. Iar. Why am I summon'd hither? thinkst thou, Dido, Thy threats or wrath can make Iarbas bend? O! noâthou art deceiv'dâhis heart remains Unchang'd, inflexible. Ãn. Presumptuous man! [aside. Did. O king! be now appeas'dâthy rank and name From me conceal'd, thou hast expos'd thy honour To ill-beseeming perilsâwhile myselfâ But sit and calmly hear me now reveal My secret thoughts. [sits. Iar. Speak onâI am attentive. [sits. Ãn. At least permit me nowâ [going. Did. Forbearâbe seated; A moment yet with patience hear our converseâ âHe cannot long resistâ [aside. Ãn. Be firm my heart. [aside. Iar. Let him depart, for since Iarbas stays With thee, O queen! it fits not that Ãneas Should share our privacy. Ãn. O yet be patientâ [aside. Did. In him thou seest no rival but a friend, [to Iar. For thee he still has pleadedâby his counsel I yield thee love; but if Iarbas think My lips deceive him, thou, Ãneas, speak, Confirm the words of Dido. Ãn. All is true. Iar. Has then the Moorish king no higher praise Than great Ãneas' favour? Did. No, Iarbas, I lov'd in thee the kingly pride that beams From every look; I love thy dauntless heart That scoffs at peril, and despises death; And if Heaven e'er decree that, join'd with thee, Thy partner and thy spouseâ Ãn. O! queen, farewell. Let this suffice, Ãneas has till now Fulfill'd your bidding. [going. Did. Yet awhile remainâ One moment moreâhis constancy is shaken. [aside. Ãn. O death to suffer! [sits again. Iar. Thou delay'st too long, O Dido! think what now thy duty claims; Yet for thy beauty's sake, transcendent fair, I pardon all my wrongs. Ãn. O heavenly powers! [aside. Iar. In pledge of faith vouchsafe me now thy hand. Did. Receive it hereâand never favouring love Could knit my future life in happier bands. Ãn. I can endure no moreâ [rises greatly agitated. Did. What means Ãneas? Ãn. What would you? Is it not enough to prove My constancy with trials so severe? Did. Ah! yet, be silentâ Ãn. Silent! I have borne Enough in silenceâto my rival, princess, You give yourself, and bid my lips confirm it. All have I done for youâwhat would you more? Shall I behold you in his happier arms? Command my death, but bid me not be silent. Did. Yet hearâthou much hast wrong'd me to complainâ Thou know'st that to obey theeâ [rises. Ãn. Yes, full well I know it allâI know myself a traitor, Ingrate and false, that Dido's constant faith For me would forfeit life and regal sway: But faith like this I can behold no longer. [Exit. SCENE XV. Dido, Iarbas. Did. Ãneas, stayâ Iar. Permit him to depart. [rises. Did. Fain would I calm his transports. Iar. What's thy fear? Give but to me thy hand, the care be mine To vindicate thy fame. Did. It is not now A time for nuptials. Iar. Wherefore? Did. Seek no further. Iar. Give me to know the cause. Did. Then learn it now: I never lov'd thee, never did my eyes With pleasure view theeâno, thou hast been ever To Dido hateful, and far less I prize Iarbas constant than Ãneas false. Iar. Perfidious! am I then an abject mark For scorn to point at? Dost thou know Iarbas? And know the man thou dar'st insult? Did. I know thee A rude barbarian and despise thy power. Iar. Call me whate'er thy rage may name, A day may sink thy pride; When thou shalt seek, insulting dame, The grace by me denied. This rude barbarian, now thy scorn, No more shall prize thy smiles; This rude barbarian then in turn Shall mock thy sex's wiles. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Dido alone. Amidst these warring thoughts methinks I find My heart more light: I little fear the threats Of proud Iarbas; but Ãneas still Even in resentment charms; in him I prize His very wrath, the welcome proof of love. Ah! could I hopeâYe pitying Powers! remember Like me you once were loversâHear, O! hear, And let your heavenly bosoms feel for mine. Ah! me, too oft the flatterer Love Would sooth my easy heart, And criesââThou soon wilt happier prove:â Still rankles here the dart. Sometime with comfort's short relief, Awhile my tortures cease; But soon my breast with lasting grief Repays a moment's peace. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A sea-port: ships ready for the embarkation of Ãneas. Ãneas, Trojans. Ãn. Unconquer'd friends, with me inur'd to bear The rage of seas and skies, resume once more Your wonted ardour. Lo! the destin'd hour To stretch our sails, and plough the faithless waves. Haste, brave companions, let the winds and storms Invade the Trojan fleet. Our future perils Shall raise our name to glory: think, the time, The happy time will come to number o'er In glad remembrance all our labours past. SCENE II. Enter Iarbas attended. Iar. And whither does this wandering hero now Direct his arms and vessels? Does he bear The war elsewhere? Or would he seek by flight To escape Iarbas? Ãn. Fate again prepares New obstacles to stay me. [aside. Iar. For a moment Thy barks may yet remain at anchor here; If thou hast courage, meet my armâbehold I dare thee to the combat. Ãn. I accept Thy profferr'd challengeâHold, my friends, I seek No sword but mine to tame yon haughty boaster. [to his followers. I am prepar'dâwhat now employs thy thoughts? [to Iar. Iar. I think thy death but little will suffice To satiate my revenge. Ãn. Far rather own To stay me now demands thy noblest effortâ âTo arms! Iar. To arms! [fight: while they are engaged and Iarbas begins to give ground, the Moors come to his assistance and attack Ãneas.] Ãn. Come, all thy realm united! Iar. Defend thee, if thou canstâ Ãn. I fear thee not, Barbarian!â [the companions of Ãneas come to his assistance and attack the Moors: a skirmish ensues, the Moors are driven off: Iarbas falls.] âThou art fallen beneath my arm, Yield, or this weapon drinks thy blood. Iar. In vain Thou seek'st to bend meâ Ãn. If thou wilt not ask Life from thy victorâ Iar. Neverâuse thy fortune. Ãn. Die thenâbut hold awhileâit shall be so. Noâtake thy life, nor deem thy empty pride Shall change the tenour of my constant soul. [Exit. Iar. I am conquer'd, not subdu'dâat least Iarbas Shall never prove alone the cruel mark Of fickle Fortune's rage: a monarch's fall Shall drag a kingdom down to share his ruin. [Exit. SCENE III. A bower between the city and the port. Osmidas alone. The Moors already, to defend Iarbas, Have reach'd these walls: behold the hour at hand That must confirm my greatness. To betray A thankless woman little I repent; I punish her injustice thus, who never Vouchsaf'd a recompense to faith like mine. SCENE IV. Enter Iarbas attended. Iar. Follow me, friends! now haste we to the palace. [not seeing Osm. Osm. Hear me, great king, your warriors are prepar'd, The time at length is come to avenge your wrongs. Iar. Away, my friends, Iarbas' fury now Admits of no delayâ [going, not hearing Osm. Osm. Yet stayâ Iar. What would'st thou? Osm. Forget not, king, that to Osmidas' truth You owe some recompense for love reveng'd. Iar. O! 'tis most trueâand mark, thou shall receive Thy recompense ere I my wish'd revenge. Osm. Most generous monarch! Iar. Seize, disarm and bind him, Then let him die. [going. Osm. This sentence on Osmidas! What rage unjust?â Iar. Such is the due reward A traitor merits. [Exit with a part of his followers; some remain to execute his orders on Osm.] SCENE V. Enter Ãneas with Trojans. Ãn. We at length are met; Not one is wanting of our scatter'd friends. No more delayâthe skies serenely smile, The winds, the waves invite usâhaste, my friends, Haste to the ships and seas. [at the appearance of Ãneas, the Moors fly and leave Osmidas bound to a tree.] Osm. Unconquer'd hero. Ãn. What means Osmidas thusâ Osm. Such is the state Iarbas, cruel kingâ Ãn. There needs no more. Friends, set Osmidas freeâhe yet shall find (Unworthy as he is) assistance where He least could hope to find it; and may learn New virtue from remorse. [the Trojans unbind Osmidas. Osm. O yet permit me In gratitude for mercy thus bestow'd, Most gracious hero!â [kneels. Ãn. Rise, and quit this place. Osm. To such exalted virtueâ Ãn. If thou seek'st To shew thy gratitude; henceforth, Osmidas, Learn better to preserve thy faith unstain'd. Osm. Whene'er the streams in mountains bred, Through verdant meadows backward led, Shall seek again their ancient bed, I'll cease thy praise to own. The night shall shine with PhÅbus' ray, When I, O chief, no longer pay My thanks for life, this venturous day, Preserv'd by thee alone. [Exit. SCENE VI. Enter Selene. Ãn. Say, princess, whither dost thou haste? Sel. To thee, O! hear me yet! Ãn. If thou wouldst hope once more To call back former loveâthose hopes are vain. Sel. What then remains for Dido? Ãn. My departure Will banish all her perils: while I stay, My presence but incites her foes' resentment. Iarbas woos her to partake his throne: To him let Dido yield her hand, and peace May once again be hers. [going. Sel. Yet stay, Ãneasâ If thus thou goest, not only Dido dies, But, ah! Selene never can survive. Ãn. What means Selene? Sel. From the day I first Beheld Ãneas, in my breast I smother'd The growing passion, fearful to betray A sister's trust; but now in death, I sue To thee, O prince! if not for love, yet hear, For pity hear, a wretched maid. Ãn. Selene, No more discourse to me of love, nor tell me Of Dido's flame or thine. I am not now The man I was; the lover's name is lost, And all the warrior kindles in my soul: My former self revives, and each that seeks To oppose my glory in Ãneas' foe. I burn a victor's fame to win, To act the hero's part; And now already I begin To triumph o'er my heart. I fly to reach the embattled plain, 'Midst arms, and death and foes; And from the sanguine conflict gain New wreaths to bind my brows. [Exit. SCENE VII. Selene alone. To scorn my flame! deny me every hope, This may be constancy for thee to boast; But if thou canst forbid a gentle heart To ease her torments with complaining love, Ah! call not then such constancy thy virtue: He knows no virtue who has lost compassion. O! Heaven, I faint, I die with love, Yet nothing can my tyrant move, Forbid in welcome death to prove The wretch's last relief. Ah! wherefore, cruel man! deny To hear my plaints, and ere I die To yield at least one tender sigh In pity to my grief. [Exit. SCENE VIII. The palace, with a view of the city of Carthage. Dido alone. Farewell to every gleam of peace! I feel, I feel my pangs increase. What means, ye righteous powers! the flame That shoots through all my vital frame? SCENE IX. Enter Osmidas. Osm. Have pityâmighty queen! Did. What wouldst thou, friend? Osm. Alas! that name but ill befits a traitor, A foe to thee, Ãneas, and thy love. Did. Ha! say'st thou? Osm. With the hope to reign in Carthage, I offer'd to Iarbas treacherous aid, Which he accepting till this hour employ'd; And now, for my reward, the tyrant sought To take my life, which great Ãneas sav'd. Did. And hast thou, stain'd with crimes like these, presum'd To come in Dido's presence? Osm. See, O queen! [kneels. A wretch, who neither hopes nor sues for pardon; All, all I ask is instant judgment. Did. Rise: To what art thou reduc'd, unhappy Dido! What planet rul'd my birth! the faith of those Whom most I trustedâ SCENE X. Enter Selene. Sel. O! my dearest sister! At length Ãneasâ Did. Has he fled from Carthage? Sel. Noâbut expect to see his sails ere long Spread wide their canvas to forsake the shore. Even now I saw him to the ready ships With eager speed conduct his following friends. Did. Ungrateful! perjur'd!âHeaven's! a wretched exile, A wandering mendicant!âWhat heart but his Could ever boast such cruelty!âAnd thou, Unkind Selene! to behold his flight, Yet want the power to stay himâ Sel. Every care Of mine was fruitless. Did. Haste, Osmidas, haste, One moment yet detain him. Osm. Let me fly To execute your will. [Exit. SCENE XI. Dido, Selene. Sel. Trust not too farâ Thou know'st not yet Osmidas. Did. Ah! too well. Such is my cruel fate, I stand condemn'd To seek his help whose treason has betray'd me. Sel. Thy hopes must centre in thyself alone. Goâseek himâbegâimploreâwho knows th' event? Thou may'st subdue him yet. Did. Shall Dido then Descend to prayers and tears? Dido, whose courage Forsook Sidonia's shores, to dare the rage Of seas and storms, in search of other climes And kingdoms yet unknown?âI still am she That with new cities grac'd the Lybian coast; That kept her state amidst surrounding snares, Amidst alarms and perilsâThink'st thou now Her soul can yield to such ignoble stooping? Sel. Alas! forget your rank, or banish hope, For love but ill agrees with majesty. SCENE XII. Enter Araspes. Did. Araspes in these walls? [the flames begin to appear at a distance amongst the buildings. Aras. I come, in pity Of your endanger'd stateâthe furious king Destroys and burns the lofty domes of Carthage. Behold, O queen! behold the flames afar Driven by the raging windâif you delay A moment now to appease his vengeful anger, One fatal day must end your life and empire. Did. Has Fortune then more evils yet in store To add to what I feel? Sel. O! fatal day! SCENE XIII. Enter Osmidas. Did. Osmidas. Osm. All around the flames prevail. Did. I know it wellâI ask thee of Ãneas, What hast thou gain'd? Osm. Ãneas is departed. Already now, at distance from the land, He cuts the wavesâI scarce arriv'd in time To view his flying sails. Did. O! senseless Dido! 'Tis thou, thou art the accomplice of his flight, Thou should'st have seiz'd him firstâReturn, Osmidas, Fly swift to yonder shore, collect my fleets, My arms, my warriorsâO! pursue the traitor, Burn, sink his vesselsâbring him bound in chains, Alive or dead, before me. Osm. Think'st thou now Of vengeance when the threatening flames increase? Did. Then let us hasteâO noâOsmidas, stay. I know not whereâmy soul is all distraction. Still art thou here? Osm. I fly to obey your will. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Dido, Selene, Araspes. Aras. Think on your danger, Dido. Sel. Think, O! think What means may yet preserve thee. Did. Do I still Bear all these woes and live?âGo, dear Selene, Thou, in my stead, provide, assist in all; And, if thou lov'st, forsake not wretched Dido. Sel. Alas! my bosom's woes transcend thy own. [Exit. SCENE XV. Dido, Araspes. Aras. Still do you here remain unterrified To view the advancing flames? Did. All hope is lost! And fear I know notâhope and fear in man Are born together and together die. Aras. Fain would I save you yetâbelieve me, queen, I shudder at your perils. Did. O! for pity Leave me, Araspes, leave me to myself. [Exit Aras. Did. My wretched fate shall one day prove the theme Of fabling verse; my sufferings shall become The mournful subject of the tragic scene. SCENE XVI. Enter Osmidas. Osm. All, all is lost! Did. So soon return'd? Osm. In vain I from thy palace sought to reach the strand; The threatening squadrons of the faithless Moor Swarm in the streets of Carthage: midst the cries And shouts of soldiers, to their impious rage The virgins are expos'd, the fanes deserted; No pity shewn to infancy or age. Did. And is there then no way for Dido left To escape impending ruin? [the flames begin to appear in the palace. SCENE XVII. Enter Selene. Sel. Fly, O queen! Your guards are vanquish'dâno defence remains. See, from the burning town the flames have reach'd Your inmost palaceâall the air is fill'd With smoke and fiery sparklesâ Did. Let us hence, And seek elsewhere for succour. Osm. Ah! what succour? Sel. Where can it now be found? Did. O! coward souls! Come, follow Didoâif your courage fails, Then learn from me to die. SCENE XVIII. Enter Iarbas with guards. Iar. Stay. Did. Heavenly powers! What do I see! Iar. Where goest thou thus dismay'd? Perhaps to take the faithful Trojan's hand? Go, haste thee thenâbehold the torches burn To light thee to the nuptial bed. [points to the flames. Did. I know itâ This is the moment of revenge for thee: Let loose thy rage, since Heaven has now depriv'd me Of all support. Iar. O no!âÃneas still Defends his queenâwith him thou art secure. Did. 'Tis wellâthou shalt be satisfiedâto please thee Shall I be wretched?âSee me then alone, Betray'd, forsaken, no Ãneas here, No friends, no kingdom!âWould'st thou have me stript Of boasted power? See Dido then at length Reduc'd to feeble tearsâDoes this suffice thee? Or must I turn a suppliant? Be it soâ I beg Iarbas to relieve my sufferings, And from Iarbas hope my welcome death. Iar. My rage is soften'd. [aside. Sel. Mercy! righteous powers! Osm. O Gods! assist us yet. Iar. I am not, Dido, The savage thou hast deem'd meâno, I feel Compassion for thy fortunesâcomeâIarbas Forgives thee every past offence, and leads thee His spouse, to share with him his bed and throne. Did. Shall I become the spouse of thee, thou tyrant! Of thee, whose impious, cruel, treacherous heart No faith regards, nor knows the social duties That bless mankind, nor owns the laws of honour? Were I so abject, just were all my sufferings: My fortune has not sunk me yet so low. Iar. In such a state dar'st thou insult me thus? âWhat ho! my faithful friends, go, spread the fires; Be Carthage in one moment crush'd to ruins, And not a trace remain of all the thousands That trod so late her desolated streets. [two guards go out. Sel. Have pity yet, and save us. [to Dido. Iar. Now indeed, Now may'st thou justly rave and call me tyrant. Soon shall thy towering city lie In smoking dust; no stranger's eye Shall o'er the wasted land descry Where boasted Carthage rose. Since thou my mercy dar'st refuse, And death itself wilt sooner choose, Thou well deserv'st, ingrate! to lose That life my grace bestows. [Exit, attended. SCENE XIX. Dido, Osmidas, Selene. Osm. Yield, Dido, to Iarbas. Sel. With thy own Preserve our lives. Did. Even yet I would consent To breathe the vital air, could I repay My wrongs on false Ãneasâfirst the cause Of all I sufferâMay the raging winds And angry Gods at least complete my vengeance! May lightning, thunder, storms and whirlwinds make The seas his graveâor let him wander far Forlorn and friendlessâsuch his wretched fate, That he, in bitterest pangs, shall envy mine! Sel. Ah! calm thy angry soul: I love him too, Yet bear my griefs in silence. Did. Love Ãneas? Sel. Alas! too trueâbut for thy sakeâ Did. Thou traitress! The rival of my love? Sel. But though thy rival, Thou hast no causeâ Did. Fly hence!âavoid my sight, Nor add new pangs to madness and despair. Sel. Unhappy queen! to what has fate reserv'd thee! [Exit. SCENE XX. Dido, Osmidas. Osm. The flames increase and yet thou dost not fly. Did. Were other foes yet wanting to my ruin? Left by Ãneas, by Selene wrong'd; Insulted by Iarbas, by Osmidas Betray'dâWhat have I done, ye cruel Gods! I never with unhallow'd victims stain'd Your sacred altars; never fill'd the air With hateful incense to provoke your wrath: Why then should Heaven and Hell conspire against me? Osm. Ah! yet reflect, nor irritate the Gods. Did. What Gods?âMere empty names! the dreams of madmen! There are no Gods, or these are most unjust. Osm. Her impious raving freezes all my soul; I leave her to her fate. [Exit. [some of the buildings fall in, and the flames are seen to increase more and more in the palace. SCENE LAST. Dido alone. What hast thou said, Unhappy Dido?âTo what rash extreme Thy fury drives thee!âHeavens! increasing horrors Surround me stillâwhere'er I turn I see Terror and death before me!âHark! it cracks! The palace shakes and threats a speedy fall! Selene and Osmidasâall, alas! Forsake meâshun me nowâand not a friend, A single friend to give me aid or death! And shall the breast of Dido then confess Such abject fear?âNo: let me bravely perish, And in my death may false Ãneas find A fatal omen for his future flight. Fall Carthage from her deep foundation! burn The regal dome, and may its ashes prove The tomb of Dido and her wretched love! [in speaking these last words Dido furiously throws herself amidst the burning ruins of the palace, and is immediately snatched from sight amidst the flames and thick smoke that break out upon her fall.
