      <field name="fulltext">SCANDERBEG: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Va mon Enfan, prend ta Fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable CHARLES, EARL of PORTMORE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by the AUTHOR. In ancient Sparta (if Records be true) The despis'd Drunkard was expos'd to View: The virtuous Youth approv'd the wholsom Law, And conscious Vice reform'd by what it saw. The same fair Justice does on Plays attend; The bad are damn'd, in hopes the rest may mend: Publick th'Example! Publick is the Shame! Such the tremendous Passport up to Fame! Equal Decree! and worthy e'en the Age, When Athens reign'd in Virtue on the Stage. If such be my Deserts, be such my Fate; I come not, Criticks,—to capitulate— To barter slavish Fear for partial Praise, And, with a begging Face, your Pity raise: I ask not any to espouse my Cause, For I shou'd blush at Party-made Applause: The Man who claps an undeserving Line, Betrays his Weakness in approving mine: No—let your Censure still impartial fly, —I wou'd not live—when I deserve to die— Perhaps I now a fair Example come, To warn a thousand Scriblers—by my Doom— Pleas'd I resign—if, from my Fall, again Neglected Learning shall assume her Reign: I'm satisfy'd—nay, Merit draw from thence, To fall a Martyr to the Cause of Sense. If, warm'd by me to Glory, there shou'd rise Some abler Poet to delight your Eyes, I, as the Cause, will share the leafy Crown, And count his future Excellence my own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. GIFFARD. Well, Sir!—What say you?—You who boldly dare Attack our Sex, and scandalize the Fair? Do you not like us by our Author's Painting? Or do you think 'tis a fictitious Sainting? He says from Nature each Idea springs, And draws us as we are—poor—harmless Things— Draws us with Beauty, Meekness, Modesty, And (which is still more strange) with Constancy. If Resolution's prov'd by fiery Trials, She sure is virtuous, who gives three Denials: Who strongly fights against the Force of Passion, And makes her Virtue conquer Inclination: Whose Honour rises timely to her Aid, Spite of the Frailties of a yielding Maid; When warm Desire boils up without her Call, And bids the pressing Lover push at All. Once ask'd, and Virtuous, is but little Merit, But she who thrice refuses must have Spirit: With distant—bowing Sparks—'tis easy Dealing; But dev'lish hard to stop the Sense of Feeling: Nature will struggle to contrive our Fall, And if she conquers—then good Night to All— For in this Point the Learned all agree, The Door will open, if she keeps the Key. To obviate this our Author makes me shew, How much the virtuous Fair, resolv'd, can do: His honest Aim strives to make me appear, What all shou'd be—and what he hopes you are.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, The Sultan's Camp. ORCAN, ABDALLA. Orcan. ABDALLA say, how stands our mighty Master? How bears his Soul Competitors in Pow'r, The dreaded Scanderbeg, and Hali-Vizem Our late revolted Vizier? Say, my Friend, Say how the Torrents of resistless Rage O'erbear the useless, unavailing Bounds Of feeble Reason, and yield all to Phrensy, To wild Distraction, and the War of Passions? Abd. Hast thou not seen, when wounded by a Dart, The lordly Lion thro' the Forest range? He roars, he tears the Earth, and, mad with Pain, His fiery Eye-balls dart a red Revenge: Such is th'impatient Soul of Amurat; Indignant of Affront, he lifts his Arm, Where the whole Thunder of the War's contain'd, To punish Rebels, and proclaim our Prophet. Orc. But say, my Friend, for (far remov'd from hence, Commanding distant tributary Lands) My Station lay: Why all this Pomp of War? Why frown the Janizaries, as if Fate Had giv'n the Word of Desolation round When Slaughter shou'd begin? I, incurious still, Have heard but little, that imperfect too; Perhaps a Rhapsody of Truths and Lies: For by the Distance Rumours are increas'd, Or by the Distance lost. Abd. Then hear from me The Cause of these Disorders: Need I swell, (That were a fruitless Task) the immortal Deeds Of mighty Scanderbeg, with my weak Praise? Fame dwells on nothing else, and has forgot, Pleas'd with the Repetition of his Name, To sound ought else: The glorious, mighty Dead That grac'd Antiquity, Heroes and Demi-gods Have lost their Worship, and the letter'd Page That blazon'd out their Worth, is read no more, Or read, not put in Competition here: All Eyes turn this way, and the raptur'd World Forget the past in wonder of the present. Orc. Thus is he spoke by all, and thus admir'd: Thou speak'st him as Humanity exacts From Man to Man, and not like bias'd Friendship;— Friendship that fondly sees but half our Faults, And multiplies our Virtues: You but shew A common Justice to a Fellow-being; Nor are we blameful thus to treat Desert, For to his Person, tho' a Foe profest, We war not with the Virtues of his Mind. Abd. But to resume my Tale: From one happy Fight (As most have been successful) he return'd Laden with Spoils, and circl'd Conquest home: Amongst the various Plunder of the Field He found the Daughter of the vanquish'd King; A Maid compleatly finish'd, and adorn'd, Serene as Peace, and lovely as Content: He saw—and who cou'd be indifferent?— To see her is to love—He led her to the Sultan— Triumphs, the Shouts of Millions are forgot, And Glory yields to Love: This sole Reward For All he did, or All he yet might do, He asks to make his Happiness compleat. Orc. Alas, too well I guess the Consequence! Abd. The Sultan wonder'd at his low Request, Too humble for a laurell'd Conqueror; But willing to comply with his Desires, Bad him look up, secure of all he ask'd:— The Maid, who hitherto suppress'd her Grief With a dejected Head, and silent Woe; Perhaps for Ease, perhaps to see what Fate Was doing with her, rais'd her languid Eyes— The Sultan's met 'em,—Quick, a Fire intense Struck thro' his Brain—The Nerves communicate The trembling Pain, and his whole Frame's on Fire.— Straight he retir'd—I cannot say to Rest, And left the wond'ring Presence in Suspense, To judge of the Effect. Orc. What of Scanderbeg? Abd. Struck with Amaze he stood, the Cause too plain; Then deeply sigh'd, and gloomily retir'd: The Day returning he renew'd his Suit, And press'd for his Consent; the furious Sultan, Starting to Rage, dismiss'd him from the Presence, Sent for the Maid to Court, and lodg'd her near him: Even at this Juncture, certain Parties rais'd, Intreated Scanderbeg to head their Troops; So to regain Epirus, long subjected, His own hereditary Right: This Affront Persuades him to their Side; by Night he fled, Gathers their Numbers—Multitudes came in To swell his Troops, and now he loudly owns The double Cause of Love and Liberty. Orc. But whence proceeded the unthought Revolt Of our Grand Vizier? Abd. From the same Cause 'tis guess'd; Tho' Liberty's the Gloss that gilds it o'er, And draws th'unthinking Many to his Side: He talks of Injuries, and vows Redress; Of long Immunities, of Ease and Property, And Times much fairer than his Purposes: By these Pretences has he link'd together An Army of no despicable Show:— Our Prophet knows th'Event. Orc. But since the Cause is in the Sultan's Pow'r, The beauteous Cause of Ruin and Destruction; Why at a distance hang his Wishes off? Why courts he for a Bliss he may command? And only looks at what he may enjoy? Abd. No, Orcan—tho' to Man the Sultan's Temper Be fierce, revengeful, terrible and bold; Yet to the Fair that Haughtiness subsides, And sinks in due Proportion to their Softness: He wou'd not rudely violate the Will, And force the Bondage of Constraint upon it: He scorns to take, what his Compulsion drags; The gentle Wing of tender Inclination, Reluctant, flies from Force: Nor wou'd the Sultan Barely possess her Person, not her Mind. Orc. How am I pleas'd to find his Passions curb'd: Such Resolution, join'd to such Humanity, (So rare a Product of a Turkish Soul) Will bless our Empire with a milder Sway, And well become our Prophet's great Vice-gerent. Abd. Here break we off, and hasten to our Charge: See where, immers'd in Thought, the Sultan comes; A pensive Sorrow hangs upon his Brow, And saddens in his Face:—Let us retire— To pry into the Secrets of a Monarch, Is dangerous as 'tis rude. SCENE II. Amurat. Why do I think, When ev'ry Thought adds Fuel to the Flame, Brings in fresh Woe, and makes the Pain perpetual? Here Reason is but giv'n us for a Curse, And Sense is, when most exquisite, most painful: But 'tis the Fate of Wretchedness like mine, We, by avoiding, run into the Danger, And striving not to think—then think the most. Furnish me then, since I must think, with Thoughts Fit for the great Occasion; Let Revenge Stalk Giant-like before—Let Fancy bring Ideal Scenes of Slaughter and Confusion— Let the Din louden, and the Tumult roar— The Horses Neighing, and the Clank of Arms Shall animate my Soul: I feel my Breast Enlarge to the great Thought; my bounding Heart Swells with its vital Tide and leaps for Joy— SCENE III. Amurat, Deamira, Zaida. And now behold how vast a Change is here!— Now my Blood chills—Again the sanguine Tide, In a tumultuous Eddy, whirls along— Life throbs and scarcely holds its doubtful Seat: Where is that furious Transport of my Soul, That struggl'd out to Glory, fled away? The raging Fires of Greatness and Ambition Sink in the more exalted Blaze of Love. Deamira— Deam. My Lord, I saw you not. Amur. And now you do, is it not still the same? How distant are your Looks, and how reserv'd! Full of Indiff'rence! Coldness and Aversion Sit at the Entrance like two baleful Fiends, To tell no Pity is contain'd within. Deam. To think me guilty of a Thought so low, Not wrongs you more, than it arraigns my Judgment: Your Worth exalts you higher than your Throne, Tho' Lord of half the kneeling Universe, The Nod of Fate, and Substitute of Heav'n; And it were Blindness not to see, and like. Amur. Hear this, ye Pow'rs! Observe how the coy fair One Wrests the kind Meaning to the coldest Sense, And into Liking, turns mistaken Love:— How was she form'd, O Prophet? Has her Heart No sprightly Pulse to heat it? Does her Breast Ne'er glow with Wishes warmer than her Looks?— (Those are enough to freeze us) But her Eyes— Say is it possible that those were made Without th'illuminating Fire of Heav'n? Say, cou'd they kindle such Desires in me, Yet want the Property of Heat themselves? If so, there is no Certainty on Earth, And false Appearance clouds Reality. Deam. My Lord— Amur. She speaks, and tho' upon her Tongue Ruin, Destruction, and Aversion hang;— Yet all look lovely, all look pleasing there:— Why was she sent on Earth to plague Mankind? Ah rather, why did you not keep her there, In those bright Mansions?—But our Crimes Wanted a Punishment thus great—or else, Thus charming as she is, the best Inhabitants, In rival Love contended for the Prize; And she, the glittering Cause, was sent away, To keep th'uncertain Peace of Heav'n secure. Deam. If I am such, so baneful to the World, O send me to some lonely Desart wild, Wide as yon bright Etherial high Expanse: There let me wander friendless and forlorn, To find the charitable Herd of Beasts, Driv'n from the faithless Commerce of Mankind, They will be kinder, and receive a Monster As terrible as them, and as destructive. Amur. No, 'tis too late—Your Mischiefs are compleat— Thou hast done all (to me I'm sure you have— All that can make me wretched)—But I rave— Forgive the Overflowings of a Soul, Sublim'd to all Extremities of Passion:— Your Goodness can, nay I am sure it will, Forgive me—Where our Desires are violent, How can our Conduct be indifferent? Deam. Alas, I feel your Sorrows! I conceive, Pity, and wish I cou'd reward your Love. Amur. Ha! Yes, it must be so—Immortal Prophet!— But I am sunk below the reach of Help— Rage will have Way—Yes!—I perceive it plain— It dawns—it rises to my lighten'd Soul Dreadfully true—Those sparkling, speaking Eyes, Those Limbs were form'd for Ecstasy—for Love— She blushes—Gods! ha! now the Colour flies— Again it comes—Oh, if her Tongue had spoke it I cou'd not have been more convinc'd!— Deam. Good Heav'n! Amur. Still new Confusion rises in her Face— I won'not—cannot bear it!—oh 'tis dreadful!— Yes, yes, she loves another—ha! she starts— Nay, 'tis beyond Conviction now!—Alas! I wanted not this Proof to make me wretched!— O Deamira!— Deam. Why was I ever born? Amur. Because it was ordain'd I shou'd be curs'd; Be curs'd above Degree!—All-judging Heav'n! Was there no Bolt, no Punishment above?— No, none is equal to despairing Love: Hell loudly owns it, and the Damn'd themselves, Smile to behold a Wretch more curs'd than They. Deam. Where will this furious Whirl of Passion end? The Storm grows high, the Ruin must light here; Defenceless and alone my Fate has left me. Amur. Where shall I find him?—Scanderbeg—'tis he— For he was born for universal Conquest: Men he subdues, and Women yield to him.— But my Revenge shall find him, yes, he comes To fall a glorious Victim to my Rage And disappointed Love—But yet my Fortune Has left her in my Power; Ha! well remember'd— Her Look disarms me—Madam, you behold A captive Monarch bound and at your Feet, More humble and more wretched than his Slaves: Yet unrequited Love, and Rage may break My present Bonds, and urge me to commit What wou'd avoid my cooler Reason. Know— But I will soften my rough Turn of Thought, And rather wou'd intreat—You guess the rest, And may provide with Ease 'gainst what may follow. SCENE IV. Deamira, Zaida. Deam. What may not follow from so wild a Rage? What may his Storm of Passion not attempt? How shall I bear this Horror?—O my Friend! The Pangs, the Tortures, which the Sultan's Soul Felt e'en but now, are Ease to what mine suffers. Zaida. Call up your better Reason to your Aid, And hope the best; That friendly Beam is left, To chear the Wretch, and lighten thro' his Sorrows; Nor can he sink so low, but Hope will find him: The pleasing Prospect of a better Day, Shines thro' the Gloom of Life and shortens Pain. Deam. In common Miseries the Wretch may find Some intermitting Hours of Ease, but here, Where Sorrow is perpetual, unexampled— There is no room for Hope—Still I must fear For him, and for my self—O Scanderbeg! The Chance of War is doubtful; Tho' I yet Revere the sacred Precepts which thy Tongue Instill'd into my Breast: The Christian Beam Illuminates my Faith, and bids me trust All that may happen, to the Will of Heav'n. Zaida. Improve that Thought, and let it arm your Soul With Patience for the worst Deam. Yes, my Zaida; New Force inspires me, and my strengthen'd Soul Feels Energy divine: The fair Example Of stedfast Martyrs and of dying Saints, Has warm'd me into better Thoughts: I now Can with a Smile behold Misfortune's Face, And think the Weight of Miseries, a Trial. The heav'nly Precepts brighten to my Mind; No useful Part of Duty left behind: Here the consenting Principles unite, A Beam divine directs our Steps aright, And shews the Moral, in the Christian Light. SCENE V. The Vizier's Camp. Vizier, Heli, &amp;c. Viz. Then we are met; the three Competitors For glorious Victory, at length are met: How lovely does the Face of Ruin look! How sternly charming! and how brightly fatal! Hear you, my Lords, that Scanderbeg has pitch'd Nearer than half a League his dreadful Camp? Heli. While, on the other Side, the haughty Sultan Erects his tented Canvas in the Air, Frowns in the Front of War, and threatens Fate. Viz. Let him frown on, what Terror can it bring To Hearts so bold, so resolute as ours? Remember, Fellow-Warriors, that we wear The greatest, noblest Cause upon our Swords: The Work of Justice is the Work of Heav'n, And our great Prophet swells our Enterprize: For Liberty, my Friends!—what Soul so servile, Will not rouse up at the great Call of Freedom? Shew me the Man so base, who sees his Rights Invaded by the griping Hand of Tyranny, And wou'd not at the Sight, with his true Sword Lop the monopolizing Arm away. Heli. If there be such, remember him, O Prophet, In thy great Day of dreadful Dooms, and shut Th'adamantine Gates of Paradise against him. Viz. By holy Mecca, my divining Soul Foresees Success attend us: O my Friends! How must the glorious Change transport us all, When into Freedom Tyranny is turn'd? When each may say his Fortune is his own, And sleep in Fullness of Tranquillity? Then shall we taste the Sweets of Life, and Ease, Which happier Climes have known: then, then enjoy That Liberty, which Britain's smiling Isle So long has boasted thro' a Length of Years. Heli. Consider, Friends, no private Pique, no Malice, No shatter'd Fortune, desp'rate and worn out, (The common Instigations of low Minds) Has driv'n the Vizier to this Field of War: If to be great alone was all his Aim, Who stood a fairer Candidate than he, The second in the Empire? No, my Friends; The Means are to be weigh'd by which we rise, Nor wou'd he mount upon the Necks of Thousands To aggrandize himself, and crush a People. Viz. Enough, good Heli, thy too forward Zeal Is proving things self-evident: The Plan, By which our Cause of Liberty is shewn, Plainly demonstrates all that thou wou'd'st say: Yet thy warm Love I kindly take as Love, And wear it at my Heart—To our Affairs— Methinks, my Friends, that our Encampment here, Lies both in Point of Action, and of Sight, As fair as we cou'd wish; this Eminence Shews us each Motion of the Enemy From either Side; and, if I might intreat, Let us be wary, circumspect, and quick To seize on all Advantage—So farewel, Till Action calls us to decide our Fate. SCENE VI. Vizier, Heli. Viz. O Heli, take me to thy friendly Breast; There let me hide me from the stormy Thoughts That war against my Peace. Heli. My royal Master! If often, in Affairs of greatest Moment, Your Heli has been trusted and found true: If I have never slept till thy Commands Were fully executed: Wherefore now This pent up Grief? This Pressure of the Mind, And I not told? Why this unfriendly Gloom, That shuts me from the Commerce of thy Soul? Viz. Thou hast been ever faithful, and my Breast No longer shall conceal it—O my Friend! Can'st thou not give a Guess at what does wound Deeper than Want, or Sickness? what out-soars Ambitious Glory on her Eagles-Wings?— Need I explain it more, and call it Love?— Heli. Lighten the dreadful Anguish of your Mind: Think that I only am what you have made me; By Choice I am the Servant of your Fortune, Your's the Support, and Ornament of mine, That hopes no longer to exist than yours, And wishes to partake its Monument. Haste then to ease the Sorrows of your Mind, And ease my Doubtings. Heli. Yes, they must have way:— Yet 'tis not always thus; Action and Arms; The sprightly Bowl, dislodge the fond Intruder, And give me all my self—O Heli, hear me! Tho' fierce my Nature, stubborn, uncontroll'd; When first I saw her, my relenting Heart Soften'd to Infancy and childish Awe. Heli. Saw who, my Lord? Viz. Ha! hast thou Eyes, yet ask? Didst thou e'er see the lovely Deamira, And ask who charms me? Is she not—O what? Perfection's Boast, and Fancy's Master-piece, The Smile of Heav'n, and Blush of Eastern-Skies! O Deamira— Heli. Cease these strong Emotions. Viz. I swear, O Heli, when I saw her first, Lovely in Tears, and kneeling to the Sultan, My Heart took fire; Confusion in my Face So strong appear'd, I cou'd not judge of theirs. O gentle Heli, hadst thou ever lov'd, Your Wonder at my Words wou'd turn to Pity. Heli. My Lord, I have; ev'n now the subtle Flame Burns upward from my Heart, and fires my Brain. Viz. Who is the Maid? I ask because I like, And will assist thy Passion; for thy Worth May to the proudest speak its Claim. Heli. To Zaida? Viz. She shall be thine; thy Services deserve her: My Word insures the Gift—the friendly Earnest. Heli. My Inclination made me serve you first, But you have fix'd it now my Duty. Viz. 'Tis enough— Ere my Revolt, I plac'd her near the Person Of my fair Charmer, so to speed my Suit, And do me further Service. Near the Sultan There is a Man, high-dignify'd, that makes His Court to her, who therefore owns my Cause, And to advance his Love betrays his Master.— But she is thine—My royal Word is past— He is a Tool, and worthless out of use. Heli. I cannot speak—my hasty Gratitude Flows crowding to my Tongue, and locks up Utterance. Viz. Let us retire—Something I have within, Of moment, to disclose—Why let the World Censure, and think as their fond Fancies lead; Mine be the Pow'r, be theirs the empty Murmur: What tho' I am a Villain, who so bold To tell me so? Let your poor petty Traitors Feel the vindictive Lash, and Scourge for Wrong; But who shall tax successful Villany, Or call the rising Traitor to account? Sublimely seated in the Pomp of State, Greatly beyond the Malice of his Fate; He laughs at each Cabal and idle Jar, The Rage of Factions, and their Party-War; By Friends surrounded, happy, and unseen, Safely he rides, and drives the great Machine. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCANDERBEG, LYSANDER, CAPTAIN. [Scanderbeg speaks entring.] No, they shall live; be thou the Messenger Of Pardon, and of Freedom: they already Have suffer'd much, Imprisonment and Chains; The conscious Pungency of doing Ill, Is Punishment enough: see 'em releas'd— SCENE II. Scanderbeg, Lysander. Lys. 'Tis god-like to forgive; yet oftentimes That Mercy sinks into a Weakness, as it gives A second Opportunity to those Who miss the first; and as the Wrong Was offer'd to your self— Scand. That very Cause Induc'd me to forgive them: were it general, The general Judgment shou'd have pass'd upon 'em: Shall I cut off the Means of their Repentance, As by their Deaths I shou'd? No, Heav'n forefend! Heav'n can again o'ertake them, if their Crimes Deserve a second Blow—Thy Business—Speak. SCENE III. Scanderbeg, Lysander Messenger. Mess. My Lord the Bassa, by the Sultan sent, Impatient to return, expects your Answer. Scand. Bid him inform his Master we shall meet him: Let a Detachment of two hundred Horse Be ready to attend me— SCENE IV. Scanderbeg, Lysander. Scand. ? say, Lysander, What means the Sultan by this Interview? Comes he to offer Terms of Reconcilement? Or thinks he to out-talk us from our Purpose? Lys. Rather to fright us into Composition, By thundering Menaces and empty Threats. Scand. Has he so oft beheld me in the Field, Encountring Dangers in the midst of Fight, To think me capable of Fear! O Impotent! I rather make this kind Interpretation; His Conscience feels Remorse for doing Ill, And wisely wou'd forego so bad a Cause. The Man who wears Injustice by his side, Tho' pow'rful Millions follow'd him to War, Combates against the Odds—Against high Heav'n. But oh! I talk untun'd; my Heart beats heavy, Slowly the lazy Spirits move their Course, And secret Dread hangs on me—Deamira— Why shou'd I fear for her?—Heav'n is her Guard, And Virtue. Lys. Thus to bear Misfortune, As what can be a greater, than to live At Distance from the Object of our Wishes; That Object unenjoy'd, and in the Pow'r Of our worst Foe—Is Constancy so firm, Such strong Adherence to the holy Mandate, As shall stand foremost in the Race of Time: Blushing I look upon my poor Resolves, A Laggard in the Race, and faintly striving To follow Excellence that soars so high. Scand. No more; Thou shalt not violate my Ear With a Reproach so harsh and so unmerited; For tho' thy Virtues shine not to thy self, (A good Man's greatest Praise) it follows not, That they do not shine at all—Thy Modesty Is the most fair Encomium on thy Worth, And when it throws a Veil upon thy Beauties, Its Blush betrays their Excellence. Lys. My Lord— Scand. Your Pardon—I have done; yet let me tell you, That what wou'd from a Flatterer displease, Is Justice from a Friend—That I am such, This close Embrace, my Character, and Word; That I ne'er spoke, or did, but what I thought, And thinking, thought it just, may give you proof. Lys. If there be ought of Merit in my Life, Your great Example made me what I am, To you the Praise belongs. Scand. —No, Lysander; A good Man ought to run the virtuous Race, The Merit is in following: But, no more; Subjects of Praise, the juster that they are, Are the less grateful to a virtuous Ear; The Meritorious holds within himself His sole Reward; the World approves it daily, And lifts th'unletter'd Fool to Wealth and Honour. I swear, Lysander, that this gentle Talk Has brought soft Images, and fair Ideas To my retreating Fancy; the gay Scenes Of Love, and Happiness appear before me, And Re-collection makes the past, the present— O Friend! To thee, who feels the Softness of a Lover, To thee I speak, who melts with pure Desire, And knows the Rapture of the brightest Flame— Unbias'd Friendship, and a virtuous Love, Walk Hand in Hand, uniting, and improv'd. Lys. While servile Inclinations, and gross Love The guilty Bent of vicious Appetite; At first a Sin, a Horror ev'n in Bliss, Deprave the Senses, and lay waste the Man: Passions irregular, and next a Loathing, Quickly succeed to dash the wild Desire; Not that I wou'd exclude the sensual Joy From virtuous Love—my Blood informs me better; Tumultuous—hot—the rapturous Glance, Piercing the Brain—the Touch, that thrills along, Trembling, where the Extremities unite Of Pleasure, and of Pain—these all forbid me To join with the wild Notions of those Men, Who fondly wou'd endeavour to explode it; And are industriously elaborate, To write against Conviction, and their Thoughts. Scand. Time, and Importance bid us wave this Theme;— Tho I cou'd hang for ever on the Tale, Where Love, and Deamira are concern'd: Yet those who never felt what we describe, May censure us as Triflers, who wou'd waste The Hours of Action in a fond Discourse Of Love, and Softness—Idle Murmurers! Where strictest Virtue, softest Love unite, How fierce the Rapture! and the Blaze how bright! True Joys proceed from Innocence, and Love, Th'unsteddy by this Lesson may improve, Disclaim their Vices, and forget to rove. SCENE V. Deamira. Deam. Where is that Constancy, that Strength of Mind, I lately wore?—Sunk into childish Fears, And weak Uncertainties—My feeble Soul, But half-instructed in the pious Task, Shou'd have a Martyr's Strength, before it felt A Martyr's Suff'ring—and my harden'd Feet, Shou'd be inur'd to Pain, before they trod So rough a Path of Trial—Oh, my Friend! SCENE VI. Deamira, Zaida. Deam. Support my Constancy, and add thy Faith To mine, lest I relapse into Despair— But 'tis unfriendly— Why shou'd I, miser-like to make me rich, Covet thy Store? Zaida. Banish these dreadful Thoughts: Idle Chimæras more affect the Mind, Than solid Dangers. Deam. And yet, my Zaida, who can shut out Thought, Or make the busy Faculties stand still, And wait a happier Hour? Were the worst, Tho' dreadful, present, I cou'd bear it well, But the severest Misery to me, Is thinking there is worse to come. Zaida. 'Tis in vain, To reason with the Seas, or talk with Winds; Passions as loudly rage, and as regardless, And Pity is the only Help, or Comfort. Deam. Forgive me, Zaida; yes, methinks, thy Strength, Thy great Example shou'd secure my Faith, And banish the whole Woman from my Soul; For oh, thy Miseries appear as great, And full as insupportable as mine— An absent Lover—and the Chance of War Levels alike at him, and Scanderbeg— Oh! we were born for Sorrow.— Zaida. Think not so, A long Succession of refulgent Years Smiles in my View, and brightens to my Mind— But see, the Sultan.— Deam. Zaida, let's retire: I wou'd avoid the Tumult of his Passion, And shun a Torment which I cannot cure. SCENE VII. Amurat, Orcan, Abdalla and Selim. Amur. You Orcan, and Abdalla, must with me: Thou, Selim, with a Thousand Janizaries, Guard this important Treasure; thy known Charge: Beauty inhabits here, and shou'd be sacred; Be it thy Care to keep it so: Let none Approach the Tent, till my Return—farewel— See that thy Care be equal to thy Charge. SCENE VIII. Selim. Sel. Thus unsuspecting Honesty betrays It self, and meeting thus the Danger, Kindly prevents the Villain's better Half. By this Time my Dispatch has reach'd the Vizier— This will exalt my Fortune, speed my Love— Love and Ambition, what shou'd have been Without 'em—but be still, my bounding Soul, Let me suppress the Joy, and tune my Tongue To the soft Accents of persuading Love. SCENE IX. Selim, Zaida. Sel. O Zaida, still that discontented Look:— How long must Sorrow linger on that Brow, And overcast the Sunshine of thy Charms? When will that Tongue resume its Harmony, And say, be happy, Selim? Zaida. Do these Times Suit with the Words of Softness and of Love? Is this a Language fit for you to speak, Or me to hear? Methinks the Front of War Horrid on ev'ry side, and threat'ning Fate, Shou'd fire thy Soul with Passions more sublime; Mine is possess'd with all my Woman's Fears, And sinks in Trembling. Sel. Fear not, lovely Maid; Our Prophet sees, and will protect thy Virtue: Lighten thy Cares, and unconcern'd expect Th'Event of Things—Thy Father will be safe; We all shall smile and live in Peace together. Zaida. Thou talk'st in Clouds— Sel. No matter, 'tis enough To tell you, that the Wheel of Fate will turn, And we ride uppermost—I wou'd explain The doubtful Meaning that is hid beneath; But Matters of such Moment urge my Haste, As cannot be delay'd—Nay, even from thee, (The last dear Hold that I wou'd part withal) Must I be torn? but as I go to fix Your Joy, it makes the Pain of parting less— Farewell, and be prepar'd to meet your Wishes. Zaida. What can the mystick Meaning be?—my Wishes! Will he, his Rival, bring Lysander here? Heav'n knows, my Wishes only are to him; Whatever Change his doubtful Words portend, Cannot be for the better—My sad Fortune, Will but put on another Face of Woe, And alter her Distress—painful Variety!— SCENE X. Vizier, Heli. Viz. See, Heli, where the happy Opportunity Courts me, to make me Master of my Wishes— 'Tis Selim's Character—He writes me here— The Sultan gone to treat with Scanderbeg, The lovely Deamira, and my Daughter, May be with Ease secur'd, and carry'd off— He farther urges Haste; left his Return Shou'd mar our Enterprize—By Mahomet! My Fortune smiles upon me—Yes, I go— Heli, do thou supply my Absence here— Mine be the Post of Danger and of Love. SCENE XI. Scanderbeg, Lysander, &amp;c. Scand. Tho' War in all its Terror, wears no Front So horrid, that I dare not look upon; For Fear on Guilt attends, and Deeds of Darkness, The virtuous Breast ne'er knows it; yet I feel For Thousands, whose inevitable Fates Must follow, if we once begin to join— 'Tis not the Quantity of hostile Blood, That shou'd exalt a Conqueror, but his Cause— One Act of Mercy sits with fairer Grace Upon his circl'd Brow, than Armies slain. Lys. How cou'd the Sultan wrong so great a Worth? Master of such Humanity and Truth, How cou'd you differ?— Scand. Alas! how shou'd we not? Turn thy admiring Eye to Heav'n, to Earth; Nature, you see, in her unnumber'd Works, Finds out consenting Principles to join, The Parents of this fair Variety: But ours How distant? Wide as Earth from Heav'n— Believe me, O Lysander, I have seen That Man, when in the Tempest of his Rage, Out-roar the Sea, when loudest, for a Trifle: Each Passion has its temporary Rule, And all by Turns are Masters.— Lys. O Description! painfully true! Scand. I swear, Lysander, The homely Villager, the Drudge of Life, Who eats but as he toils, is happier far: No self-Division, Bosom-Anarchy, Disturbs his Hours; thoughtless he labours on, Nor is at Leisure to be wretched. Lys. What cou'd be then expected from a Man, So lost, ev'n to himself? where ev'ry Gust Of idle Inclination bore the Sway, Himself retaining but the Name of rational. Scand. Lysander, in the poorest Faculties, Least blest with Reason and the Gifts of Nature, Some Gratitude is found, some kind Return For Favours past: But here it was not so— Have I not led his Armies to the Field? How seldom have I fought without Success? Adorn'd his Crescent with so bright a Blaze, That it outshone the Sun that gaz'd upon it? And all to be despis'd: One Boon deny'd— Dismiss'd the Presence like the meanest Slave— These are such Wrongs, my Friend, as who can bear That owns Mortality: Our great Example Was sensible of Wrongs, tho' he forgave 'em. SCENE XII. Scanderbeg, Lysander, Captain. Capt. Upon the Steep of yon high shady Hill, As on my Watch I stood, I saw some Troops Of shining Men, swiftly they bent their Course Towards the Sultan's Camp. Scand. Lysander, thou Take Horse, and with a Party watch their Motion: SCENE XIII. Scanderbeg, Captain. You to the Camp with speedy Diligence, And bid our Numbers gently march this Way. SCENE XIV. Scanderbeg. Should we, by too much Confidence betray'd, Fall a defenceless Prey to Villany, What cou'd be said for us? 'Tis wrong to trust Those, whom their very Priests instruct, to keep No Faith with us. When wicked Men make Promises of Truth, 'Tis Weakness to believe 'em. [Trumpet sounds. The Matter? [A Captain enters. Capt. Sir, the Sultan. SCENE XV. Amurat, Orcan, Abdalla, Scanderbeg. [The Sultan looks sternly at Scanderbeg, then speaks.] Amur. We formerly have met on better Terms; Let the Remembrance die—That haughty Air, And insolent Disdain, as well inform me, As Fame can speak, that thou art Lord of Thousands: It has been otherwise, the Time has been When thou wert humbler—then a poor Dependant, The Jest of Fortune and the Mark of Pity. But thou art alter'd now; Gigantick Pow'r Has stretch'd thy Pigmy Being to my Equal. Scand. Whatever Change my Fortune may have known, How alter'd from that humble thing you speak: Thy Insults tell me, thou art still the same, Unmanner'd still: Humanity and Kindness, Which shun thy Nature, can alone disguise thee: As for the Merit to appear thy Equal— That I decline—and cannot call it Pride, To think the greatest bad Man far beneath me. Amur. Dost thou hear this, Oh Prophet? Christian Canter! Who fondly mak'st thy Impotence a Virtue, And not inclin'd, or able to resent, Think'st Suff'ring meritorious. Scand. Falsly urg'd! That shining Range of War, thy very Fears Retort upon thee to thy own Conviction: No, here I stand, the Instrument of Heav'n, He to a second Means transfers thy Punishment, Unworthy of the Blow from him—But say, Do meeting Kings, who stipulate the Terms Of angry Kingdoms, thus begin to treat, Thus in a Woman's War of Rage, and Passion? Amur. Then to resume the Man, and please you, Sir— Say why thou lead'st embattled Armies on, Against the Pow'r that rear'd thy tender Years? Why, now thy Race of Manhood is begun, Striv'st thou ungratefully to tumble down, That friendly Prop, which was thy first Support? Why shin'st thou now in Arms, without a Cause Assign'd or known? Are these thy Christian Tenets? These the much-boasted Principles of Justice? Scand. But that I know thou speak'st not as thou think'st, Ev'n to thy self a Hypocrite—Thy Folly Wou'd from thy own Discerning hide thy Crimes, And put a virtuous Gloss on Vice—My Wrongs Must else, ev'n at this Instant have appear'd, And struck thee dumb with Guilt—I cou'd repeat 'em, But that I think it needless—And cou'd add To them, the many Favours I have done to you, But that I will not—No, 'tis Folly's Office, To speak her Praise, while real Merit hears it. But I shou'd wonder more at thy remembring— The Man who cou'd forget the mighty Hand That form'd him first, must always be ungrateful. Amur. This thou can'st say with Ease, but wou'd evade The Proof of ought that thou wou'd'st urge against me. What are thy Wrongs? Scand. First, my native Right Debar'd from me, was I not born the Lord, The Ruler of Epirus? By what Means Became it added to thy Right?—By Force?— If so, Force must regain it—I desire not The Wealth of other Kingdoms, nor their Lands; The Spot that I was born to is sufficient— Hereditary Title makes me Lord, And Manhood will maintain it. Amur. Thou hast for this some Reason; but suppose I shou'd deliver up my Title there: What can'st thou else complain of? Scand. Dost thou ask? Is there not yet behind a Wrong so great, As Patience scarce can bear?—A Wrong—Good Heav'n! Which ev'n to think upon, affects the Brain, And runs me into Madness—What are all The Pomp of Kingdoms, and the Wealth of Worlds? One virtuous Glance from Deamira's Eyes, Out-shines 'em all—'Tis here I feel the most— Here Pain shoots thick, here Misery attacks The frailer Part, and Manhood cannot bear it!— But why do I expostulate with thee, Whose Glory is in others Pain, whose Pride in wronging? Amur. Your Passion is your Tutor in this Lesson, I make Allowances, and know too well How wild the Words are, when that bears the Sway— But listen farther—Tho' I might insist, As you but fought my Cause, that she was mine, That I decline, as more the Right of Force, Than free Consent—Her Will, you must confess, Has the best Title to dispose her Person; Yet still to let you see how dear thou art, That I remember still what once you were; Take back your Kingdom, be the Second here, Divide my Heart, but— Scand. Woud'st thou barter thus For Love and Justice—No, the Pow'r above, Who at one Look sees all the Riches here, Sees nothing that can equal the Exchange— Is she not— Amur. More than thou can'st figure out; Ev'n Fancy wants Materials to supply The bright Resemblance—The swift Wing of Thought Cannot conceive the Excellence she wears, As well the unsteddy Eye might comprehend The glorious Sun in his Meridian Blaze, And at one View take all his Brightness in. Scand. Why wou'd'st thou idly traffick for a Gem Inestimable?—Impotent and vain!— Amur. Yes, if this Gem were yours, it wou'd be so. Scand. Ha! Amur. Nay, wonder not, the Sex are all the same, Their Appetites alike delight in Change, Desire the only lasting Passion there— At first the easy Lesson made its way, And sunk into her Soul—The Object gone— Was she to mortify with Sighs and Tears, And grieve her Youth away—She better thought— Believe it, she is mine, howe'er Appearance At first deceiv'd you with the Show of Favour. She has recounted all the gentle Tale Of your first Loves, and laughs at it with me. Scand. No more, 'tis basely urg'd, I'll hear no more— 'Tis Profanation but to doubt her Truth, And ev'n to pause upon that Doubt, a Crime: This Artifice is vain as it is base, A Trick beneath a King, beneath a Man— Hence with thy petty Terms—Begone—Tomorrow Expect me in the Field before the Sun— Farewel— Amur. Since thou art bent on Ruin, To-morrow thou shalt find it—So farewel— SCENE XVI. Scanderbeg. Scand. False? Deamira false? Immortal Heav'n! What are the most compleat of all the Kind, If she be turn'd Apostate? What those Stars, That glitter in the blue Expanse of Heav'n? Sure 'tis Illusion all, and false Appearance: But hence ye idle Thoughts, ye vain Chimæras! Her Truth and Constancy I judge by mine, And certain of my Love, am sure of hers: O Woman!—Let the Libertine decry, Rail at the virtuous Love he never felt, Nor wish'd to feel—Among the Sex there are Numbers, as greatly good, as they are fair; Where rival Virtues strive which brightens most, Beauty the smallest Excellence they boast; Where all unite substantial Bliss to prove, And give Mankind in them, a Taste of Joys above. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE, The Vizier's Camp. VIZIER, HELI. Vizier. Curse on their Coward Souls, with so much Ease To let so small a Party bear away The half of our great Prize—What, what is Man? How much unlike himself, when servile Fear Usurps the Faculties of Enterprize, And throws an Ague over Resolution? So sudden was the Attack, so fierce the Onset, Swift as th'Alarm they ran, scarce look'd behind To see their Enemy—Selim alone, oppos'd The Force of Multitudes, and gave up Life, When he no longer cou'd keep her—Love's Victim. But why this Gloom? If Fate was in the Deed, Then who can alter it?—If Fate will have it so, Thou may'st regain her yet, and yet be happy. Heli. That Thought is vain!—Confusion and Distraction! Oh had I been but there—Why that tame Wish? I shou'd have gone my self—My self her Guard, She wou'd have come secure— Viz. Alas! thou rav'st! What cou'd a single Hand? Heli. What cou'd it not? The Cause wou'd have inspir'd, and giv'n my Arm The Strength of Thousands. Viz. This is idle Rage: Your cooler Reason wou'd instruct you better, But that is lost in this rough Sea of Passion: 'Tis impotent to grieve for what is past; And unavailing only to exclaim, When we to more Advantage might employ That Time, so lost, by striving to regain her. Heli. O! 'tis in vain to argue with my Rage— Reason to Prejudice, to Winds, or Seas— Bid Pain not follow when a Limb is broke; Or when one Eye is torn from forth its Orb, Command the friendly other not to weep— But here your vain Philosophy is lost, And the grave Teacher's Lesson idle Talk. Viz. Then give it Vent, let the big Grief have way, Pour forth the Stream at once, and ease your Soul. So when a Rider curbs a mettled Horse, He pulls with Force impetuous, bounds and swells With double Strength—but give the slacken'd Rein, Swiftly he flies—At length by just Degrees His Spirits waste, his Stubborness decays, He stops obedient to the gentlest Check. Heli, farewell; when next we chance to meet, I shall again behold my Friend, whom now Passion has alter'd from himself—farewell. SCENE II. Heli. Heli. 'Tis easy, happy in our own Condition, To bid the Wretch be so, or learn to suffer:— Perhaps 'tis pleasant to behold the Storm From the safe Shore—Perhaps 'tis so with him— And, in the full Enjoyment of his Wishes, Laughs at the Pains of others—Shall it be?— Shall he, supine in Wantonness and Ease, Stretch'd on a yielding Bed of Down, or Roses, Behold me tortur'd on the Rack?—Oh no!— Ha! yet a Thought remains of Comfort—yes— Nought else can serve my Love—It shall be done. SCENE III. Deamira. Deam. When will the Tempest of Misfortune rise To its full Height of Terror and Dismay? Can their be yet Addition to my Woe? Or is there yet a Pain I have not felt? Ev'n from my Days of Infancy, The Chain Of Ills began, and lengthen'd with my Years: A tender Mother lost—a Father slain— A Crown subjected, and a Nation slav'd, Begin the List—yet these might be endur'd, As Things in Nature and the Turn of Fortune— But now the Miseries of Love succeed; Belov'd, and loving, yet debar'd each other, Plac'd in the Pow'r of one, whose lawless Will Ne'er feels the gentle Check of Moderation; Who knows not what it is to see, and like, And not enjoy—Yet, in this Scene of Woe, I found a kind Companion in Misfortune, Whose Constancy assisted mine, and made Me wait the coming of a happier Day: Her I have lost—nor know I where I am— But see—one enters—and my mystick Fate Begins to shew it self. SCENE IV. Vizier, Deamira. Viz. Madam, I come Not to augment, but dissipate your Fears; Let not your Apprehension shape you Ills, Which live but in Idea: Let those Eyes Perform the Offices they were design'd, And light the World to Gladness. Deam. Sir, this Talk Shews me the Courtier, not the Comforter. Exalted Compliments are not for me, They shou'd attend on Merit's highest Flight; Praise to the Undeserving is the worst, The most severe Reproach, and sharpest Irony. Viz. You thus declare yourself, because you know That Modesty becomes a female Brow; That conscious Blush however has betray'd you, And tells me that you speak against Conviction. Your Pardon, Fair; I mean't not to increase The bright Confusion— Deam. Sir— Viz. I say, 'tis Pity That this fair Hand shou'd have so sad an Office, To wipe these unavailing Drops away. Why that cold Look?—But I'll revenge me here, On this soft Hand, which, yielding to the Touch, Disclaims the cold Aversion of those Eyes, And tells me that your Heart has warmer Wishes. Deam. [Aside.] What will my Fate do with me?—O my Fears!— Have I not Cause for Grief? for streaming Sorrow? What Change of Woe? What sad Alternative, Have not I known? Is this a Time for Smiles? This a fit Season for the jocund Turns Of sportive Mirth?—To Happiness an Outcast, The Jest of Fortune, and the Mark of Pity! Viz. 'Tis but the Softness of thy gentle Nature, That gives too easy Entrance to these Fears: Fortune sometimes assumes a rugged Brow, But to endear her Smiles, and make the Turn More welcome to us, as 'tis unexpected— How sweet is Rest after a toilsome Day! How pleasant Light after a Length of Darkness! How relishing Good-Fortune after Ill! Deam. You speak as if my Miseries were done, As if their Date were finish'd— Viz. Yes, they are; A fairer Prospect of new-springing Joys Appears to court the Fancy; Bliss substantial, Delights, which in Idea have not reach'd you; Transports so fierce, so exquisite to Sense, That the charm'd Soul shall bound with Ecstasy, And wonder at the new-felt Joy!— Deam. No more: These are the Sounds of Happiness; the Wretch, Like me, must banish such fond Thoughts, Such gay, delusive Scenes, and strive to make His Fate familiar, so to make it light. Viz. Hence with this rooted Obstinacy! hence with Care! Those who inclines to think their Fate severe, Deserve to feel the Stroke: Calamity Presses upon the feeble Mind, and sinks it down, While the opposing Spirit struggles thro', Unites with Hope, and conquers Difficulty. Come, come: no more: Let us prepare— Deam. For what? Viz. For Bliss too great for Words—for Ecstasy— Which nothing can describe but meeting Souls— For Love, my Fair— Deam. Alas! Viz. Why start you so? Is Love a Stranger to so soft a Form? Does he not sit in Triumph on thy Brow? Or waits to ruin, ambush'd in thy Smiles? Swells he not with thy Breast? Or with thy Heart, Beats to th'enamour'd Wretch the loud Alarm?— A Start—'tis a Reproach for my Delay— Ev'n you reproach me, and those weeping Eyes, Faintly condemn the talking Loiterer. Deam. For Pity, Sir!—If by Humanity Your Mind be sway'd, O talk not to me thus!— Throw not more Weight of Miseries upon me, Ere I have learnt to bear the present Ills: O! name not Love; alas! his gentle Wing Avoids the rugged Couch of hard Misfortune, And flies to Happiness, and Beds of Down: Why then to me— Viz. This Coldness is put on; I swear it is, nor shall you make me think The Subject were ungrateful, did you like But him that urges it—but that's my Curse— What wou'd be Musick from a fav'rite Tongue, Is Dissonance and Discord from another. Deam. You wrong my Meaning: Viz. 'Tis my Wish I may— Nay, I wou'd have you think 'tis of Importance To know how great the Merit is to ask, Where we may use Command—Nay, start not, Madam, He governs not the worse, who knows his Pow'r— But I am summon'd hence—'tis worth your Care, To think with Candour of yourself, and me. SCENE V. Deamira. Deam. No, I disclaim all Thought, let Unconcern Attend my future Steps; let Misery Vary each Shape, and tire Misfortune out— They tell us that the highest Pitch of Woe Sinks into better, and by slow Degrees, Reaches the Point of Good—but 'tis not so with me; All are Extremes of Woe, yet never end. SCENE VI. Lysander, Zaida. Lys. What shall I say? My over-hasty Soul, That wou'd unlade its happy Freight at once, And pour the Torrent out, among the Crowd Of hurrying Words, yet fails of Utt'rance— O! how can I describe—how bear the painful Joy!— Zaida. If after Absence it be Joy to meet? After a Gloom if the Sun shines more bright? If Happiness refines by Sorrows past? Such then is ours, exalted and above The common Rank:— Lys. Transcendent lovely Maid!— But the big Rapture is too fierce, too strong; Th'unmanagable Joy o'erleaps its Bounds, And draws ev'n Pain along with't—O my Fair!— Teach me thy Steddiness, thy Unconcern Amidst this Flow, and pour in some Allay. Zaida. Alas! that soon must follow: think, Lysander, Think for thy Friend, for mine—think that their Woes, Like our Joys now, are to no Bounds confin'd; But rise into the opposite Extreme, Tear the distracted Soul, and rend the Heart. Lys. Too true, alas! the sympathizing Pain Shoots thro' my Bosom, and I feel for them— This too appears the mystick Work of Heav'n, The equal Distribution of that Pow'r, That orders all Things, and gives the Hope Of better to the bad, and tempers Bliss, Nor suffers the too luscious Draught to cloy— O, Zaida! what are the most perfect Joys? What the vain Boast of frail Mortality? The Birth of Accidents, th'Event of Time?— But Heav'n disposes all, and all is just— Why shou'd I quarrel with its Dispensations? It guided me to thee; it brought thee back To Love, and to Lysander—tho' my Friend Feels the sharp Stroke of Trial; yet ev'n he Not murmurs at his Fate—And shall I, bless'd, Thus happy in my Wishes then exclaim? Zaida. No, let th'Example teach us Moderation, And wisely give a virtuous Check to Bliss— Lys. But let us haste to share our Friend's Distress, And by our sharing, lighten—well we know, Whole Years of Joy glide unperceiv'd away, While Sorrow counts the Minutes as they pass— 'Tis Virtue's Office to suppress its own, And bring Addition to the Bliss of others; Or by partaking ease their Sorrows. Let us, hence, Speak Comfort to his Woes, and ease his Soul. SCENE VII. Amurat, Orcan, Abdalla, &amp;c. Amur. Hell and Confusion! Horror and Despair!— O! for the Force of Thunder, for the Rage Of angry Heav'n, and our insulted Prophet— For the collected Strength of Armies join'd— For the swift Wing of Time, or flying Thought, That my Revenge may overtake, and strike The false perfidious Villain to the Centre— Orc. How Passion tears him! Abd. Nay, 'tis vain to offer To sooth his Rage— Amur. Why did I trust the Slave? Why leave her in his Pow'r?—Ungrateful Prophet! Thou sat'st supine in Indolence and Ease, And from the Banks of Paradise beheld Her snatch'd away, nor sent thy Thunder after— Cou'dst thou not pull the Crescent from my Head, Tumble the Throne of Ottoman to Dust— But leave her here?—She was my Paradise— Thine has no Joys for me now she is gone— Abd. How strangely is he mov'd! Amur. I took the Slave From Earth, to Favour, from the dark Recess Of long Oblivion, to the Shine of Majesty— Trusted and made him great—believ'd the Slave Was only what I made him—such he seem'd— But what was that—Appearances deceive, And this one Maxim is a standing Rule, Men are not what they seem. Orc. My royal Lord— Amur. Villain, be dumb—fly from the falling Stroke Of quick Revenge—Impending Ruin waits To crush thy Insolence, and bold Presumption— O that my Word were the whole Will of Fate, A Nod shou'd rend the distant Poles of Heav'n, And into Chaos tumble human Nature!— But why do I expostulate?—to Arms— Sound the last Trumpet, beat th'eternal Doom, Let Ruin thunder, Terrors multiply, And Death be the least Horror—O, my Heart! Abd. When will this Tempest sink into a Calm, And Reason re-assume the steddy Rule? Amur. O Deamira! I had treasur'd up Whole Years of Happiness, of sweet Content With her:—and thus to lose it all—good Heav'n! Have I not Cause for Rage, for boundless Fury? For the whole War of Passions—Hence, to Arms:— Let each Commander hasten to his Charge; I will appear to lead you—My Example Shall animate the whole, invigorate the Weak, And make the Coward conquer—What is Danger? What the vain Rush of Thousands, to a Breast So resolute as mine?—Immortal Prophet! If thou wou'dst have me think thou art at all, Rise from thy downy Bed, thy Seat of Ease— Forget the Joys of Paradise a while; To a tremendous Fury change thy Smile: Thunder with me, in the bold Front of War, Lanch the swift Jav'lin, mount the ratling Car, With hostile Armies strew the sanguine Plain, Revenge my Cause, and be at rest again. SCENE VIII. Scanderbeg discover'd reading. Scand. 'Tis greatly true; the loving Hand corrects, Reproof is Kindness from a friendly Tongue, And Trials wait upon the chosen Man— Why shou'd we murmur at the friendly Hand, That pulls us back to Good? Why, why impute That to Severity, which but appears Paternal, anxious Fondness for our Safety? Nay, let us bring it to the Point of Proof, And we shall find Misfortune here a Kindness: In the warm Flow of gay Prosperity, The pliant Mind too easily admits The Stamp of Ill—the Fool of ev'ry Sense— Affliction's Hand so moulds and hardens it, Th'Impression fails—the Courser loosely rein'd, Too often stumbles—but with Art held in, Safely he journeys on—My Friend! What News? SCENE IX. Scanderbeg, Lysander. Lys. A Man disguis'd, who from the Vizier's Camp Has stoln his Way, desires a Conference With you alone. Scand. Conduct him quickly in. SCENE X. Scanderbeg, Lysander, Heli. [Lysander goes to the Door, and brings in Heli disguis'd.] Scand. The Danger you have past, this Hour of Night, Speaks some important Business—what— [Heli signs to Lysander and the Door. Lysander, Tho' at my Heart, as a try'd, faithful Friend, You hang dear as my own; and what one holds Must be communicated to the other— Yet for his Satisfaction be it so.— SCENE XI. Scanderbeg, Heli. [Heli throws off his Disguise. Scand. Heli!— Heli. I see your Wonder and Amaze; The Cause for which I came will more surprize you. Not to prolong your Expectation, know, And think me as a Friend, a Friend convinc'd, Who wonders at thy Virtues, and wou'd join 'em. Scand. I do confess my Wonder at a Sight So strange, and unexpected—but proceed— Heli. Your Wariness is just—but I come arm'd Against all Doubt—not only will profess, But prove my self a Friend—nor imagine The Spleen of a discarded Fav'rite; The desp'rate Turn of forc'd Necessity, Persuades me to approve and own your Cause. Scand. Thy Love is the more welcome, as it flows From an unbias'd Motive, and is found The pure Result of Penitence, and Thought. Heli. To prove it such—tho' still I see Distrust Hangs on your Words—this Night shall make you blest; This happy Night shall lead you to the Height Of your sublimest Wish—to Deamira— Scand. Ha! Heli. My unsuspected Honesty can gain Admission to her Presence; then with Ease She may be carry'd thence to both your Wishes— The Vizier's Confidence in me is firm; And easy Confidence full oft performs What a free open Force attempts in vain. Scand. May not some Purpose lurk beneath these Words, Some dark Design of Treach'ry and Deceit?— I've heard of such—and shall I trust this Man?— Trust?—whom?—He, who without a Cause, betrays His Master—His first, great Support?—But then, Shall I reject the Opportunity That Fortune seems to offer to my Wishes?—[Aside. Seems—as it only seems I must Hel. You muse; Are Love and Deamira to be weigh'd, Against your present State, in such nice Scales? Or, weighing them, do they appear so doubtful? Or is it but a Matter of Indifference, Not rising to a Wish that you might meet? Scand. O say not so—the Pow'r that knows my Heart, Finds not a greater Wish within it—Deamira!— To clasp her in these Arms, to gaze intranc'd On her lov'd Eyes—to wipe away the Tears Of boundless Joy, and gaze on her again— To hear her speak—No, that I cou'd not do— For ev'ry Sense wou'd hasten to my Eyes, And seeing her wou'd gratify 'em all— And ask you if these Transports be indifferent?— Heli. I judg'd as much, I judg'd you by my self— Such is the Force of Love, and such the Joy, To find the long lost Object—such the Transports, Such the tumultuous Rapture I shou'd feel, To meet with Zaida. Scand. Ha! I see it now: But to destroy thy fruitless Hopes at once, Know, that her plighted Love has long ere this Been given to Lysander—to my Friend; Nor cou'd I help thy Suit, were I inclin'd— Or if I cou'd, it were in vain to ask it— Take back thy Terms, return again in Safety; Learn to be honest, and subdue thy Passions; Study the Charms of Virtue, and detest The guilty View that bids thee sell thy Master— Nor once imagine, at th'Expense of Honesty, To purchase Happiness—A fruitless Thought! Heli. I am amaz'd!—Can you decline the Means To make you bless'd? Will you refuse— Scand. No more: When we can find a virtuous Means to meet, Doubt not my Readiness: but that is left To Heav'n's all-seeing Will, and best Disposal— Hence, and depend upon a Prince's Word; Tho' I reject thy Terms they still are secret.— SCENE XII. Scanderbeg, Heli, Lysander. Scand. Lysander! Let a Convoy be prepar'd To give this Person Passport to his Camp— SCENE XIII. Scanderbeg. Scand. How poor! how despicable Nature seems, Productive of such Men—The guilty Mind Debases the great Image that it wears, And levels us with Brutes—Immortal Truth! How do thy radiant Particles refine, And greatly prove thy Origin divine! What Raptures bring'st thou to the virtuous Breast, Parent of Joy and everlasting Rest!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE, The Vizier's Camp. HELI. What is this Virtue? what this foolish Pride Of Doing well, that the fond Christian dotes on? Is it a Revelation but to them, A Beam directed only to their Sect? Or but the vain Enthusiastick Talk Of selfish Teachers? Is it more than Name? Is it the Prejudice of Prepossession, That actuates our Minds to think that true, Which has but the Authority of Time, Imbib'd in Infancy, and grown with Years?— —But how shou'd I account for what I know not? Greatness is Happiness to me, and that Flows not from Self-denial, and the Train That waits upon their Precepts—But the Morn Rises upon my Thoughts, her silver Hand With her fair Pencil strikes the Darkness out, And paints the glorious Face of Day. 'Tis Time To turn my Thoughts upon the great Occasion, And in the swelling Tempest that must blow, Look for a Port of Safety:—If my Fate Will have me fall, why, be it so—Yet ere My Summons comes, I have some Time for Mischief: Ha!—But 'tis Weakness to deliberate, When the close Action shou'd pursue the Thought. [Going. SCENE II. Vizier, Heli. Viz. Turn, Heli. Heli. Ha! The Vizier here!—Confusion! Has he then been inform'd of my Deceit, My Practices with Scanderbeg?—If so— But he knows it not, shou'd then my Fears Betray me to him?—What a State is Guilt, When ev'ry thing alarms it! Like a Centinel, Who sleeps upon his Watch, it wakes in Dread, Ev'n at a Breath of Wind. [Aside. Viz. Wherefore, Heli, Stand'st thou thus distant, when thy Master wants Thy Counsel, and thy Aid? Thou art not sure, Like common Friends, neglectful in Adversity, The Servants of a Day: I think, my Heli, Thou art not such. Heli. My Lord, you know.— Viz. I do; Thy Honesty speaks clearly in thy Face, And thro' thy Eyes I read it in thy Soul. Heli. Then what is all Appearance—[Aside.] Say, my Lord, How can a Man so great in Pow'r as You, So absolute in all that he can wish, Find Room for Sorrow? The lost Wretch, like me, Fated to Woe in all its dire Extremes, And torn from what He loves, may well repine, Choose out this sad Receptacle to grieve; And think himself to Madness:—But to thee. Viz. Alas, thou canst not guess my Wretchedness! Heli. To thee, whom Fortune reaches both her Hands, Lavish of Bliss; What Ill dare look at thee!— High plum'd Ambition mounts upon the Wing, And bids thee soar to her sublimest Point; While robb'd Love with easy Dalliance, Invites thee to the yielding Couch of Beauty. Viz. Hold, Heli, hold: Bring not that Image in To add to my Distraction—Thou hast struck The Master-string that reaches to my Heart, And sent a sanguine Flood of Madness round me, Deamira! Hel. Is she, my Lord, the Cause? Is she not yours, within your Pow'r, your Will? Waits she not on your Wish?— Viz. Alas, my Friend! 'Tis there the Malice of my Fate strikes home, This my supremest Curse, to have her here; And yet not have her mine, while Miser-like, I but behold my Treasure, not enjoy. Heli. 'Tis then because you won't—the Miser true, Starves 'midst his Plenty, from the slavish Fear Of wasting what he heaps; in Love the Niggard, Is still more hateful and more wretched; Seize The glorious Prize, and taste without Control: Trust me, my Lord, the Banquet will out-last Your Appetite to eat. Viz. What dost thou mean? Heli. To force her to your Arms—'tis no new Doctrine. Viz. Ha! Hel. What an exalted Face of Pow'r it shews, To bow the haughty Mind of Disobedience, And make Compulsion answer Inclination? What Joy to take, what is deny'd our Pray'r, And make Resistance Pleasure? Viz. Say'st thou, Heli!— No, thou mistak'st the End of Bliss—What Joy Can flow from forc'd Affections? What proceed From the dissever'd Strings of Union? If by Force I make her mine, she murmurs in the Bliss, And but endures the Touch; nay, hates her self, Because she pleases me: But oh my Friend! When Minds are join'd; when ones consenting Touch Thrills Musick to the other:—This is Transport; This the sublimest Rapture—Here the Souls Spring with concordant Love, and the strain'd Eyes, Endeavour to describe the Extasy, When Words are at a Loss. Hel. Then quickly lead her To the expecting Bed of Scanderbeg; He without Doubt will thank You for the Gift, And laugh at your tame Virtue. Viz. Hell and Furies! Shall he enjoy her? Shall my Rival taste, Nay, taste alone, the Joys I languish for? And shall I help him too? Stand this Shock, Reason, And thou art Proof against the worst of Ills. Shall I shut out eternal Day from me, To give him Light? Shall I tear Comfort hence, With all its Train, to place 'em in his Breast? No—Heli.— Heli. This can never be endur'd. Viz. And yet can I shake off Humanity, And deaf my Ears to Innocence? and Pray'r? Can I behold Distress, in all its Shapes, Imploring Beauty eloquent in Tears, Yet keep the Avenues to Pity shut? Hel. Yet think, my Lord, for whom his Sorrow flows— For Scanderbeg—Your Rival, and your Foe.— She weeps indeed—but 'tis because she's here— She pleads for Mercy—to preserve her Virtue, That she may bring it to his happy Arms: She wou'd leave you most wretched, to bring Joy, Eternal Joy to him. Viz. I'll hear no more!— 'Tis plain, her Beauty plots against my Peace, And every Sigh, and Tear is a Conspirator:— She shall be mine—Revenge shall have its Fill Of luscious Beauty; my Desires shall stray To the Extent of Bliss: The Wings of Time Shall be so burden'd with our Extasies, That he shall stop to taste the swelling Joy. Heli. This speaks the Hero, Sir, the Prince and Man. Viz. Yes, Heli, now I feel my self a Man; Ev'ry tame Wish and little Fear subsides, My Pulse beats high, my bounding Heart exults, And my quick Spirits aid the glowing Thought Of Madness, and of Love: Do thou, my Heli, Prepare her for my Will; acquaint her too, With my Resolves: They say Resistance, Tho' but affected, makes the Transport more, And adds to the great Joy—If it be so, How boundless must my Rapture be, when ev'ry Sense, Reluctant, is compell'd, and Sighs and Tears Beat Time, responsive to my Extasy! SCENE III. Heli. Hel. Now for a Master-stroke of Villany: It shall be so—for I have felt her Charms, They countenance, nay justify Deceit;— I must prepare her for the am'rous Fight.— The Vizier shall by me be made to think, His Tent a Place improper for the Deed; Her Cries may reach the Army, whose Conjectures May shape some Danger to his Enterprize: She therefore must be led to some wide Place, Where Echo only can o'er-hear her; And That she may be brought with Ease, will I pretend, That I'll renounce the Vizier's Interest, And fly with her to Scanderbeg: Then I Appoint the Vizier a wrong Place, and riot In the warm Folds of Beauty—'Tis resolv'd. SCENE IV. Deamira. What art thou, Happiness, so sought by All, So greatly envy'd, yet so seldom found? Of what strange Nature is thy Composition, When Gold and Grandeur sue to thee in vain? The Prince who leads embattled Thousands forth, And with a Nod commands the Universe, Knows not the Language to make thee obey; Tho' he with Armies strews the hostile Plain, And hews out Avenues of Death, he still Loses his way to thee, because Content Appears not on the Road, to light him to thee:— Content and Happiness are then the same;— And they are seldom found but in the Bed, Where unmolested Innocence resides. Shou'd I then hope to find her in my Breast, Where Anguish and Disquiet only reign! No, let her elsewhere stray, I wou'd not wish her, So dark, so desolate, so sad a Mansion. SCENE V. Deamira, Heli. Hel. Think me not rude, because I boldly press Upon your private Thoughts; Affairs of Moment Will plead in my Excuse. Deam. There needs not any; My Sorrows, Sir, are open at all Seasons, To ev'ry Comer in. Heli. Obdurate he, Who unregarding sees this Flow of Grief; Who hears unmov'd the Tempest in that Breast, Nor once endeavours to allay the Storm. Deam. Pity, Alas, grows up in other Soils, I do not hope it here. Heli. And yet I come, To prove that Pity which you wou'd disclaim!— How shall I utter what my Duty makes Important to be known? I wou'd conceal— And yet wou'd tell it, but am lost in Doubt, Which wou'd be least Afflicting: for to know, Arms for Prevention, tho' 'twixt Hope and Fear; Pardon, unhappy fair One, and believe, That my officious Warmth, to give you ease, Wou'd lean to the least Evil; I wou'd wrest, Half of the Meaning of the dreadful Tale, To any Sense—but what I fear it means. Deam. I thank you, Sir, this Preparation's kind, Tho' 'tis unnecessary; for Misfortune Has been so us'd to visit this sad Place, That she may enter now without a Ceremony. Heli. A noble Disregard of what may happen, Speaks an Heroick Mind: Calamity Loses its Sting 'gainst such a Resolution, And blushing at its Impotence, retires; Know then— Deam. Why do you pause, Sir? I wou'd know the worst, Nor soften what thou bring'st with gentle Words; The worst is less than what I apprehend. Heli. The Vizier loves you. Deam. Ha! Heli. And where a Love Wrought to Extremes is found, it never stops 'Till sated with its Wish. Deam. Alas, my Fears! Heli. Think what a Torrent rushes thro' the Sou When Love lights up Desire; how swift its Course! How wide the Ruin! and how fierce the Blaze! Ev'n Age, as by Divinity inspir'd, Feels a new Warmth, and temporary Youth. Deam. Where does this tend? What means this Preparation? Heli. O gentle Lady, can a helpless Maid, Potent alone in Pray'r and speaking Beauty, Make Head against the violent Attacks Of raging, lawless Force? What then avail The Sigh of Sorrow, and the Tear of Woe, The Sigh unminded, and the Tear unseen? What's Elocution to the Ear that's deaf? Or a fine Prospect to the blinded Eye? Deam. O gracious Heav'n! He will not, cannot mean it. Heli. When Reason is dethron'd, and Passion reigns, When Appetite prevails, what Ravage follows? Think if he shou'd (as he has sworn to do) Make all Resistance vain; in spite of Cries, And Tears, as fruitless, force you to his Bed. Deam. O 'tis too much! I cannot bear the Thought! But sink beneath the apprehensive Weight. [Swoons. Heli. She faints; her easy Nature cou'd not bear The Shock of such a Trial: Charming Sorrow! Oh how thou fir'st me! Her soft tender Form Will bear but little struggling: She revives— Now for my other Face, and Words of Comfort, That speak in fair Appearance, such as fall With Down, and sooth the panting Breast of Beauty. How is it, Lady? Deam. Why, how shou'd it be?— When the Brain turns and feels the Lash of Madness, Can we do ought but well, when the hot Spirits Ferment and boil?—O Excellent!—I feel The quick Rotation—Stop, Oh stop, old Time, Thy Hour-wing'd Chariot, let my Head relieve Thy hoary Age, and run the boundless Race— Heli. Alas, poor Lady! Sorrow has disturb'd The Seat of Reason: But it cannot last; Passion in Woman is of short Duration. Deam. Ha! now I mount—I whirl in Thought's Career— Vizier, thou can'st not over-take me now— Down with thy Thoughts, with thy black Thoughts to Hell, I soar in purest Element, to Regions White as my Virgin-Wishes—To the Plains Where Scanderbeg resides—I see him now— Triumphal Arches circle him around; The Victor's Wreath, and the warm Lover's Wish Sit lovely on his Brow—Where has thou been?— O take me to thy Arms! O quickly take me, And save me from Pollution— Heli. How her Thoughts, Tho' struck with Madness, image out her Fears. Deam. Let me steal back a Look from this safe Place— O save me—hide me!—See there where he stands, Dreadful as Tarquin—Drive him down again— Hot impious Wishes glow upon his Cheek, And sparkle in his Eye—Strike, strike the Monster Down to the Centre—Ha! 'tis done! he falls, And I find Rest again!—O Scanderbeg!— Heli. So now she melts into a Flood of Tears, Her Rage quite spent—She'll tire herself with Grief, And soon be well again: Madam, retire, Lay Ease and gentle Comfort to your Heart, And hope much better than your Fears inform: When Rest has giv'n the Rule again to Reason; I will instruct you how to 'scape these Ills, And fix your Happiness—'Till then, farewell; And think me the sincerest of your Friends. [Leads her to the Door. SCENE VI. Heli. Poor Soul! I warrant she believes it all, And thinks me what I seem: By Heav'n, her Charms Have quite effac'd the Mem'ry of the Love I bore to Zaida; she has left my Breast, And the whole God pours in, on her Behalf.— To Day the Battles join—Th'Event uncertain— When in the Storm, and Fury of the Fight, Will I compleat my Wish, while Drums and Trumpets, And the whole Voice of War shall drown her Cries; New spirit up Desire, and lead the Soul To the full Stretch of Bliss and rapt'rous Joy. SCENE VII. The Sultan's Camp. Abdalla, Orcan. Orc. Abdalla say, now the fair Face of Morn, Drest in her maiden Blushes, looks abroad; Why stand our Troops unactive, under Arms? Why this long Pause, nor yet the Signal giv'n To rush to the big War? Has dear Revenge Fled from the Sultan's Breast? Are all his Wrongs Forgot, and sleeps he in a peaceful Mind? Abd. He sleeps indeed, but who can call it Rest, When all the busy Faculties employ'd, Tear the distracted Mansion—Passions meet, And combate with each other—Rage, Despair, Stern Indignation, fiery Revenge Rise up at once, and bring Distraction with 'em; Oft he reproaches our high Prophet's Sloth, Or Impotence, to strike for his Revenge;— As often he recalls his Profanation, And begs for his Assistance—Then, in Rage, Loudly he curses Selim, all the World, And wishes it extinct with him—Nature now Sinks with the vast Expence of Spirits down, Affording a short Interval of Ease, To wake him to more Torture—O my Friend! Who cou'd imagine that the silken Boy, The soft'ning Pow'r, whom fondly we call Love, Cou'd be the Parent of so fierce a Tumult, So wild a War of Rage, and boundless Passions? Orc. 'Tis wond'rous!—And if such be the Effect, Such the dire Consequence in ev'ry Breast Of the unequal Joy: Preserve me still, O Prophet, from the Pleasure and the Pain. Abd. But hark the Trumpet speaks the Sultan's Rise, And warns the Soldier of approaching Fight— Action, and Arms demand our Presence now, And summon us away to War, and Glory. SCENE VIII. Amurat. The Morn returns, the Face of rising Day Shines Beauty on the World—The gentle Flow'rs Shake the damp Load of nightly Dews away, And open to the Sun—All Nature smiles— The whole Creation feels the Influence Of the diffusive Joy—While I alone Abandon'd and accurst, can find no Gleam To light me thro' this Depth of dark Despair— But why do I complain?—Can that redress?— All Means of Comfort are cut off but One, No Avenue left open but Revenge: My Wrongs and Insults call for warmer Work, Than the cool Measures of decisive Judgment, And the weak patient Impotence of Reason. SCENE IX. Amurat, Abdalla. Amur. Abdalla, hasten, bid our Armies march, Let all the Implements of War strike up, And trumpet out Revenge; let the Clouds rise And darken upon Horror: I'll appear Full in the Front of Fate, and deal it round. Abd. My Lord, our Enemies on either Side Seem in a full Security of Ease; If in this Unconcern we steal upon 'em, A Blow may give us Conquest. Amur. Be it so: Do thou, Abdalla, take the Charge on thee, For Oh thy Master's is unequal now, To any Task where Judgment is concern'd; Here lies my Pain, my Torture—Something here Tugs at my Reason with Herculean Force, And must o'erthrow it: Be it Rage or Love, 'Tis Fire, I am sure, and must destroy the Mansion— I cannot hold my self—I wou'd o'er-leap The Bounds of Life, to find some little Ease— I rather wou'd be Nothing, than be thus. Abd. Then think upon the Means to find that Ease, And not upon the Cause that gives the Pain. Amur. Oh thou cool Talker! Ha! not think upon it— Is it a voluntary Act to think? Will Recollection cease at my Command? Can I hew off this Limb with Unconcern? By thinking on the Ointment that will heal— Impossible! I know I ought not think of it: Like a lost Ship, blown down by adverse Winds, I know that I should steer a diff'rent Course; But who can stand against the Blast of Fate? Then farewell, Reason! This shall be my Remedy, To bury Thought, I'll think my self to Madness. SCENE X. Abdalla. Abd. What art thou, Nature, with so great a Flaw? How much more worthy Pity than the Brute, Does he appear? whose Reason is laid waste, And all the Faculties of Judgment void, Who wears the Image, and the Name of Man, Yet loses what shou'd truly make him so. SCENE XI. Scanderbeg, Lysander. Scand. Lysander, no; the Merit is not much Where virtuous Thoughts inhabit, 'tis a Pain, A Labour to be vicious: We must strive Against almost insuperable Odds, To bend a Mind, if well dispos'd, to Ill. Lys. But to bear Trials of the deepest Kind; Severest Miseries—is more than Use, Or what the best Philosophy can teach; 'Tis more than Nature, 'tis a Help Divine, That strengthens, that informs, and moulds the Soul To this heroick State of Unconcern. Scand. No more, Lysander; this revives some Thoughts That will betray the Man in all his Weakness; I find a Tenderness dissolve within, To wash away my firmest Resolutions; Let me improve the little Virtue left, And bear it as I ought—For, Oh my Friend, Thou can'st not think but I must feel my Woes; I were not Man, Were I not sensible of Pain and Sorrow: 'Tis generous ev'n to feel foreign Woe, In a responsive Sympathy to others. I am but to the World, in some Degree, A better Hypocrite—A gay Dissembler.— Of this enough—Do thou, my dear Lysander, Study to make thy Happiness appear Less than it is, as I to make my Woes Seem lighter—'Tis a virtuous Task!— Lys. O Words! That flow in sweet Persuasion, and can turn Misfortune into Merit, and Increase Of worldly Good; that shew us Happiness Gliding thro' Ill, to him that is resolv'd To find, and fix her State— SCENE XII. Scanderbeg, Lysander, Captain. Capt. My Lord, prepare: As on my Post I Westward took my View, To watch the Motion of the Sultan's Pow'r, I saw the well-compacted Troops, in Arms Compleat, march slowly from their Camp; The length'ning Train appears upon yon Hill In fair Array: Quick Flames retortive, dart From their bright Arms, and to the Sun return The Lustre that they borrow—But my Eye, In the wide Prospect, cou'd not shape their Course; Or hitherward, or to the Vizier's Camp, Uncertain if they bend. Lys. The furious Sultan, Losing his Mistress, spirits on the War With mad Precipitance, and to the Vizier Directs this threaten'd Fury. Scand. 'Tis most like; But let us hold ourselves in ready Plight For fiercest Action: 'Tis the wise Man's Care, To hold Prevention at his judging Will, And meet the meditated Danger arm'd. Bear thou my Orders for a speedy Fight; Let each Man, with his Arms, put on his Diligence, And wait my Signal. SCENE XIII. Scanderbeg, Lysander. Scand. —O immortal Justice! Thou undivided Particle from Heav'n, That lengthens to its Substitute below, And arms his subject Hand with Majesty Terrifick: For thy Cause, a willing Agent, My Sword I draw: Do thou inspire the Stroke With Prevalence divine—As thine the Wrong, Vengeance and Punishment to thee belong; The injur'd State of Innocence restore, Crush the bold Insults of aspiring Pow'r, Shine like thy radiant Source, and make the World adore. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. HELI. Thus far Success anticipates my Wish; And every Omen whitens to my View, Prophetick of my Happiness: The Fair, From the Abundance of her Honesty, Ascertains mine; and has resolv'd to go Whither I lead—to Scanderbeg she thinks— The Vizier too is by Appointment led A different Course: How I cou'd hug my self For well-invented Mischief— SCENE II. Heli, Deamira, Welcome, Lady! My studious Honesty o'ertakes the Time With swifter Flight, and shews me waiting here, Still more than punctual. Deam. 'Tis in Virtue's Cause, And she must crown thy Diligence with Virtue: And yet ere long perhaps my Thanks may speak In more than Words, and offer a Reward. Heli. O gentle Lady! name not a Reward; Thou hast it in thy self—thy Meekness speaks, Thy Condescension, and Humility, Temper'd with something, not to be express'd; Not barely plead for, but command this Justice— I swear by Mecca 'tis to me most strange, That any, temper'd with a human Mind, Can see such Sweetness wretched. Deam. They, alas! Who know not Guilt, suspect it not in others— But we lose Time—nay, pardon my Impatience;— My Fears of Danger, Hopes of Joys to come, Will have it pardon'd. Heli. Lovely, virtuous Maid! My Expectation rises to a Pitch As exquisite as thine: Like thee, I long For the Completion of thy Happiness; For tho' th'Intent of Good be meritorious, Yet when we see the virtuous Act compleat, 'Tis then we taste the Profit and Delight— Haste then, and let me lead thee to the Bliss I long to give—to the expecting Arms Of him, who waits impatient to be blest, And must know thee, and Happiness together— Without I have provided thee sure Means Of Safety, and Escape—Be that my Care, Thine be the Joy to come. Deam. Thou honest Man! But Thanks are poor—for thou hast done so much, I want the Words to say what I wou'd do, To recompense such Goodness—'Tis enough To tell thee that I labour a Return, And Gratitude sets down the Obligation. SCENE III. Scanderbeg, Lysander, and other Commanders. Scand. 'Tis as I wish'd; the Hand of Heav'n is in it, And points this easy Way to Victory; Wonder with me, Lysander, at the Pow'r, That turns th'injurious Stroke upon themselves; At once the Suff'rers, and our great Avengers. Lys. How dreadful is the View! The Front of War, On either Side, looks Ruin and Dismay: The Armies, opposite in hostile Rage, Seem like the Verges of tremendous Fate, The Space between a vacant Grave for Thousands. How many look erect in manly Strength, Healthy to View, that, but some Moments hence, Shall prostrate, press the crimson Field in Death! Scand. That Thought, tho' shocking, is not yet the worst— Death is the lightest Evil we shou'd fear; 'Tis certain, 'tis the Consequence of Life: Th'important Question is not that we die, But how we die. Lys. O Misery of Thought! That traces Thousands to the End of Being In mortal Clothing, and yet leaves 'em there Dark, chearless, and uncertain where to wander. Scand. While to our View a pleasing Hope appears, And brightens the safe Way with Christian Beams: Here the serene, the tranquil Mind, tho' bent By Fate unequal, struggles out to Day Eternal: While the trembling Beast of Guilt, Wretched in Recollection, fears in private The Pow'r that impotently he disclaims; Unwilling, yet instinctively a Coward. Lys. 'Tis a sad Prospect, turn th'o'er-labour'd Mind To Scenes of happier View; let Fancy bring Somewhat of fairer Cast; let Innocence, Or Maiden Virtue, undefil'd and pure, Strike pleasing on the Sight, and fill the Soul With Images of Joy, and bright Ideas. Scand. Christians and Fellow-Warriors, you behold How Heav'n in Justice to it self and Us, Strikes back the meditated Blow on them, Who meant it here: That great, all-seeing Pow'r, By their own Paths lets 'em find out Destruction; And leaves to us the easiest, lightest Task: With Gratitude receive the Benefit, Nor idly lavish the rich Gift of Good— But hark—the Death-denouncing Trumpet sounds The fatal Charge, and Shouts proclaim the Onset— Destruction rushes dreadful to the Field, And bathes itself in Blood: Havock, let loose, Now undistinguish'd, rages all around; While Ruin, seated on her dreary Throne, Sees the Plain strew'd with Subjects truly hers, Breathless and cold—the Work of fell Revenge:— My self will at a distance mark which way Conquest inclines; while each Commander here, Stands ready for the sudden Rush of Fate, To find at once a glorious Victory. SCENE IV. Heli, Deamira. Heli. How loud Death sounds! how terrible his Voice! Death, that in Chambers steals so softly on, And comes like Sleep or Ease to tir'd Mortals; Here boldly rouses ev'ry Faculty, With dreadful Preparation for the Blow, As if— He scorn'd the Triumph of a single Fall: But here, where Thousands perish, he exults, And gives the Stroke in his full Pomp of State— Thou trembl'st, Fair—Alas! thy gentle Nature Ne'er felt Alarms like these—The Sound, too harsh, Jarrs with the Harmony that dwells in thee, And strains Concordance to a Pitch too high. Deam. Blame not my Nature, that admits too soon My Sex's Fears; I own, I feel 'em all— And yet the Hopes of the Reward in View, Might arm my Mind against this Woman's Weakness, And feel the Nerves of sickly Resolution: Come, lead me on then, 'tis to thee I go, O Scanderbeg! to thee, whom my strain'd Eyes Ake to behold: To thee, whom these glad Arms Long to embrace, and hold for ever there:— I feel new Strength, new Vigour shoot around;— My Fears melt down, and manly Force inspires me: Let us be gone— Hel. Be not impatient, Lady:— Still Danger threatens unperceiv'd by thee: Send thy Sight thitherward, where thro' those Trees Thou seest the hostile Rage of Fate strike wild; That must be pass'd, ere we can reach the Port So much desir'd; a River widely flowing, Hinders our Progress any other Way, Than by a Bridge there plac'd: The Chance of War May soon remove 'em from that Spot of Earth, And then we pass secure; 'till when, this Wood With its green Shade envelopes us around, Unseen, yet seeing; here the tufted Grass Affords a kind Relief to weary Nature, Unus'd to such Fatigue; here let us sit, And talk of Love, and its bright Influence; Of Joys that rise up to the Point of Madness, And Beauty that lights up the fierce Desire. Deam. Alas! that Subject ill becomes us now. Heli. Never so well:—Look round, no curious Eye Prys thro' these thick Recesses; Love alone Sits sportive on the Boughs: The warbling Birds Chant Courtship to each other, and reproach My Negligence. Deam. Ha! what can all this mean? Heli. Consult yourself, and then, what can it mean? What, but a boundless Passion? Ask this Touch; Trembling, it answers Ecstasy and Transport: It means the Bliss unrival'd; the fierce Pow'r That springs thro' ev'ry Alley of the Soul, To bring in melting Joy, and balmy Transport. Deam. O Heav'n! for Pity's sake— Heli. No more I say— True, this Hypocrisy looks well in Publick, 'Tis a Decorum to Brow of Beauty, And awes the Crowd to distant Reverence: In private 'tis but ill-judg'd Obstinacy To coy it thus, and but affect Indiff'rence; We know your Appetites like ours are fierce; Passions as furious sweep along the Soul, And Nature wholly rules the weak Machine. To one who knows— Deam. O gen'rous Sir, yet hear, Hear the sad Pray'r of kneeling Wretchedness: Thou seest a Maid whom the whole World forsakes, Whom Fortune has cast off: Whom Pity can, And only can make happy: Think, great Sir, How much more great the Attribute to save Than to destroy! I know you cannot mean it; Humanity sits gentle on your Brow, And your looks bid me disregard your Words. Heli. Thou reason'st right, for I too long have talk'd. O 'tis a kind Reproach!— Deam. You will not, sure— Heli. Not trifle longer, nor wou'd I have you— Think that each Moment is a Loss to Love, Thus idly spent—he will exact severely The strict Account, and term us Loiterers. Deam. And was that Honesty but false Appearance, Which you so boasted, and I so believ'd? Heli. How ignorant thou talk'st! what, Honesty! A Name, scarce Echo to a Sound:—Honesty! Attend the stately Chambers of the Great— It dwells not there, nor in the trading World: Speaks it in Councils? No; the Sophist knows To laugh if thence: Why shou'd we waste the Time In dull Discourse on nothing?—Come, no more— Let me not take what I wou'd have a Gift— Hence with Resistance— Deam. O! for Mercy's sake!— Heli. 'Tis all in vain— Deam. No Help, no Succour nigh?— Heli. None can approach; no Cries can here alarm The distant Ear: Remoteness all around And solitary Intricacy dwell. Deam. Then Heav'n assist me in this dreadful Hour; See my sad State, hear my distracted Cries, And send some speedy Miracle to save me. Heli. I tell thee, Fair, Heav'n hears not all this Sorrow, The Voice is much too weak to reach so high, 'Twas made on purpose so; for well it knew, Had you a Voice in common with Mankind, They shou'd be deaf with your eternal Clamours. Therefore no more— Deam. You cannot, sha'not force me— My Cries shall spirit up the brute Creation, Ev'n they, less sensible,—but less inhuman Than thy fell self, shall rise up on my Side And fight the Cause of injur'd Innocence, Of lost, unhappy, wretched Deamira— SCENE V. Heli, Deamira, Vizier. Viz. Behold her Champion here! Heli. The Vizier!—Hell!— But 'tis in vain to think of a Retreat, And I must on, or fall. Viz. Perfidious Wretch! Thy num'rous Promises of Truth and Honesty Made me suspect thee Faithless—Partly that— And that I wou'd not venture such a Treasure, As Deamira, in another Hand, Urg'd me to have thee watch'd—A diff'rent Course To that appointed didst thou take: The News, Ev'n at the Head of charging Thousands, reach'd me; I left th'Event of clashing Fate uncertain, And swiftly flew to overtake thy Purpose. Heli. Thou hast overta'en, but may not yet prevent it; I will not offer at a dull Excuse, And plead the Force of Stars, or Destiny; What I have done, this Arm must justify, Which thus obeys the Dictates of its Master, And dares thee to thy strongest Proof of Manhood. Viz. Insolent Wretch! ungrateful and accurst!— Thou hast the best Excuse for Perfidy, Thy Love for Deamira—But no more; Take thy Reward, enobled by my Hand. [They fight. Heli falls. Heli. Thou hast o'ercome—what, what is Life or Man? How quickly do we pass from one Extreme To the steep Verge of t'other!—how we haste From Joy to Misery—from Life to Death— And from a Something, bustle into Nothing— 'Tis painful—Now 'tis easy.— [Dies. Viz. Why, this is well—'tis fit that so the Slave Shou'd die, a Victim to his bold Presumption; So shou'd he fall who proudly soars at Heav'n.— How far'st thou, Love?—what, quite beset with Fears? The Sight of Blood, of Wounds, and Death affrights thee. Come, let me hide thee from the dismal View In my safe Bosom—Nay, this Coldness wrongs thee— It calls thee thankless, sullen, and ungrateful, To him who sav'd thee from a Slave's Pollution. Deam. O say not so—what Words—what great Return Can rise up equal to the mighty Gift? My Gratitude stands waiting but to know How it may be employ'd. Viz. 'Tis easy done— Nor shall it wander far, to find the Means Of ample Restitution. Deam. Name it, Sir. Task ev'ry willing Faculty of Mind, Command my Pow'r—(if the sad Wretch like Has any left) or failing there, my Prayers. Viz. No, my fair Charmer, be those treasur'd up For wint'ry Age, for joyless, sleepless Nights, When Pleasure palls, and Appetite decays— Give me the present Moment of thy Love— Give me what he wou'd take. Deam. Alas, my Lord!— Viz. And have I not deserv'd it—Ask myself Why have I led yon shining Host to fight, And giv'n 'em up to Fate, but for thy Sake? Why flows the Blood of Millions on the Plain, But all for thee?—And wherefore have I left The Field of Death, where once I us'd to ride, Triumphant over slaughter'd Heaps, but to attend The Call of Love, that brought me to thy Aid. Deam. I own these Obligations, and would run As far as Death to make you a Return— But my eternal Fame—O think on that— That gives me Comfort in the deepest Woe— My Virtue lost, were to lose Rest for ever; Murder, Peace, and Innocence at once. Viz. Chimæras all! The Trial will betray Your Fears unjust—Still Peace shall hover round you, And not one stormy Thought disturb the Mansion. Deam. 'Tis all in vain, for Oh my spotless Fame! With Life is bound up in a single Knot, Which cut, can never be restor'd to Union. Oh think again, great Sir! is not Obedience Flowing from Love, more sweet than from Constraint? Time may do much— Viz. Such Sounds might once, I own, Have chang'd the Purpose of my firmest Temper, And made me wait with Patience for the Gift Of Love and Deamira—Now 'tis past— I will make sure of Part of Happiness— Therefore no more—The Eloquence of Angels, Temper'd with the Command of our great Prophet, Shou'd lose their End, to sway me from my Purpose. Deam. Ill fated Wretch! with what Precipitance Thy Sorrows fall! how quickly do they turn The dreadful Round—Still baleful, still destructive! Viz. I can no longer dally—My hot Blood Beats the fierce Charge—and irritates Desire— That breathless Slave has made the Preparation, And talk'd my Lesson over—Thus I seize— Deam. For Heav'n! for Mercy! look with Pity down! Aid my weak Efforts! Help!— Viz. 'Tis fruitless all— Thy Cries grow weak, and with thy Strength decay— Be then advis'd— Deam. Never—But thus to Heav'n, To Earth will call for Succour, and for Help: Hear me, some Angel, wing to my Relief!— Take my sad Life, but spare the Violation— SCENE VI. Scanderbeg, Deamira, Vizier. Scand. The Sound of female Sorrow and Distress, Has thro' a Maze of Windings hither led me: 'Tis Virtue's Call—Ha! do I awake, ye Pow'rs?— Say, can I see?—or see I Deamira?— 'Tis she—'tis she herself—my Heart confirms it By this fierce Start—that labours to o'er-leap The Verge of Being, to be nearer her. Viz. Wilt thou not yield?—Resistance is as vain As Hopes of Help. Scand. Die, Villain, in that Thought, [Stabs him. And learn thy Error in this Stroke for Virtue. Deam. O Bliss unlook'd for—Ha! my Prayers are heard— And sent ev'n him, ev'n Scanderbeg to save me. 'Tis so—I know him well—and yet scarce Whether 'tis he—so boundless is the Joy. Scand. O Deamira!— [Embrace. Viz. Hell and Furies!—Cou'd there yet Be an Addition at the Verge of Life, To Misery like mine? I thought the Sword Had giv'n me Pain enough—but that Embrace Throws a redoubled Hell of Tortures on me— Eyes, burst thy Strings, and start to instant Blindness. So, the remaining Cord of Being cracks— 'Tis Death! 'tis Darkness—but to me 'tis Ease. [Dies. Scand. Return, my Love, nor let th'unwieldly Joy, For ever sink thy Beauties in the Vale Of gloomy Death—Fly not, Oh partial Life! Just as we come to taste thy Happiness!— But see—Death hears the earnest Call of Love, And gives her back new-rising in her Charms. Deam. Still I am here—and still the mighty Transport Wou'd overbear again the Seat of Life— Stop the big Flow, and keep the Torrent down— It will have Vent—it rises at my Eyes In Tears of flowing Joy, to give me Ease! Scand. O Deamira! thus at last to meet— I wou'd say something to tell what I feel, But 'tis impossible!—I have thee here— That comprehends it all. Deam. But say, my Love, What Miracle cou'd bring thee to my Aid, So greatly wanted, yet so unexpected? Scand. Heav'n order'd all—The Battles loudly joining, I chose this Shade to watch the Turn of Fate Unseen; the Voice of distant Sorrow here Assail'd my Ears, just as I had dispatch'd Lysander, the Companion of my Steps, To lead our Army to the Rush of Fate, On their disorder'd Troops, and end the War— I trac'd the Sound—it brought me to thy Aid, And to this Happiness—Ha! Death I see Has been already here. Deam. The Traitor, Heli. O Scanderbeg, I have a length of Woes To tell thee of; but that this Place of Horror Startles Imagination with what's past. Scand. Let us retire—I too am call'd upon To animate the War—The Care of thee Shall be my first Concern, and Conquest next. SCENE VII. Amurat. Where are these Slaves? Why do they shun a Fate So noble, as to die by Amurat? Where is the faithless Vizier—Scanderbeg— Have their pale Fears transform'd into Air, To cheat my Vengeance?—Let but them appear, Tho' arm'd with the Artillery of Heav'n, And let us tug for Life and Deamira— Ha! Fancy brings 'em to the working Brain— The Vizier dead—I thank thee, Scanderbeg— Confusion!—Deamira there?—Perdition! Hell! She smiles Content—and riots in my Torture— Shew me where Læthe rolls Oblivion on, And let me drown Remembrance—Fix me, Gods— To the Rotation of the ceaseless Wheel— Let me have Loads of Pain, to divert this, This worse than all Hell's Pains—their Happiness. SCENE VIII. Abdalla, Amurat. Abd. Fly, mighty Sultan, from this Place of Death; All is o'erthrown, the very Hope of Conquest lost: Ev'n Life uncertain—Haste—delay not, Sir— Amur. Ha! who art thou, who with an Ague Hand Strikes trembling on the Coward Note of Fear? The Day has caught th'Infection of thy Look, And sickens to a Gloom: ev'n I perceive An icy Fear creep shiv'ring to my Heart— Thou hast done this—Away, Timidity!— Now I blaze up, and emulate the Sun— I am all Fire—our blended Rays descend, And set the World on Flame—'tis a fit Torch, To light me to Destruction and Revenge. Abd. Alas! he raves—give Reason, Sir, the Rule, And fly pursuing Fate—Your Armies conquer'd— The Vizier's too—by Scanderbeg o'ercome. Amur. What hast thou found him?—Ha! thy Looks are chang'd, And stern Dismay has redden'd over Fear, With Terror's Painting.—Lead me quickly on,— I forgive all this Ravage of my People, The Loss of Empire, Reason and of Love, I forgive all but to o'ertake that Slave— Knit thy stern Brow, Revenge—Let Desolation Take Hands with Vengeance: Let the Furies join Their complicated Horrors—Sun, stand still And see me act this Justice—Prophet, blush At thy own Impotence, that cou'd not strike So bold a Blow as Amurat.—Away— Hark! how Fate thunders to the wondring World; The Sultan strikes—the Universe falls down, And at one Blow I end the human Race. [A Retreat SCENE IX. Scanderbeg, Deamira, Zaida, &amp;c. Scand. Stop the Pursuit of Fate—enough already Has furious War destroy'd—O Deamira!— Tho' thus to have thee, has been still the Wish Of ev'ry Thought—tho' the Extent of Pray'r Aim'd but at thee; yet oh! believe me fair One— This Slaughter of my Kind has damp'd that Joy, Which else had sprung without the least Allay— But Nature form'd thy Excellence so rich, Thou wer't not to be bought at a less Price. Deam. How can my Joy find Birth amidst my Fears? How can my Fears prevail against my Joy? Be thou my Guide in both, and temper both; Thou know'st to mould the Heart so much thy own. Scand. Supremest Good! What Comfort can I bring, O gentle Zaida, for a Father lost? But as thy Goodness knows to bear the worst, It therefore knows to stand the Shock of this. Zaida. O think not—Gracious Sir, but as a Child I feel a Father's Loss—yet I consider, Lost to himself, he must be so to me: 'Tis Heav'n's Decree, and I think Happiness, Far better not to be, than what he was. SCENE X. Scanderbeg, Deamira, Zaida, Lysander, &amp;c. Scand. Thou wer't dispatch'd to call the Field to Rest, And find the Sultan out: What News, Lysander? Lys. Alas, my Lord, I have beheld a Sight, Which in an Enemy is pitiful— The Sultan, mad with disappointed Rage, Flew restless round the Field to find you out; Revenge sat on his Brow and Desolation; But finding all his Search and Rage in vain, He cast a Look so terrible to Heav'n, As he wou'd send his Wrath to War above; Which his vain Impotence design'd—for lo, He loudly cries—Be thou accurst, O Prophet! And tho' I cannot overturn one Slave, One earthly, creeping Slave, yet think not thou Shall be secure, tho' in thy Paradise.— No—I will tumble down thy whole Machine, And make thee share my Ruin—Having spoke— He stretch'd his Arm with so secure a Grasp, As if the Axis of the World were his, And he cou'd pull down Chaos at his Will:— Then strongly straining, he cry'd out—'tis done— And falling under the imagin'd Weight, His Soul by Supposition took its Flight, And left the tortur'd Mansion now at Ease. Scand. 'Tis terrible, but such his Passions were, Might warrant such an End as has befallen— See for the next remaining Heir, Lysander; And let the regal State devolve on him; Ours be the Crown of Virtue, and of Love. Let the Ambitious labour to be great, Still long for Canopies and Godlike State; While humble Minds substantial Blessings prove, Content their Portion, and a virtuous Love. FINIS.</field>
