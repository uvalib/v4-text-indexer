      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. As the Musick plays a soft Air, the Curtain rises softly, and discovers an Indian Boy and Girl sleeping under two Plantain-Trees; and when the Curtain is almost up, the Musick turns into a Tune expressing an Alarm, at which the Boy wakes and speaks. Boy. Wake, wake, Quevira; our soft Rest must cease, And fly together with our Country's Peace; No more must we sleep under Plantain shade, Which neither Heat could pierce, nor Cold invade; Where bounteous Nature never feels decay, And op'ning Buds drive falling Fruits away. Que. Why should men quarrel here, where all possess As much as they can hope for by success? None can have most, where Nature is so kind As to exceed Man's Use, though not his Mind. Boy. By ancient Prophesies we have been told Our World shall be subdu'd by one more old; And see that World already's hither come. Que. If these be they, we welcom then our Doom. Their Looks are such, that Mercy flows from thence, More gentle than our Native Innocence. Boy. Why should we then fear these are Enemies, That rather seem to us like Deities? Que. By their protection let us beg to live; They came not here to Conquer, but Forgive. If so, your Goodness may your Pow'r express; And we shall judg both best by our success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCEN. I. Enter Ynca, Orazia, Montezuma, Acasis, Prisoners, with Peruvians. Ynca. Thrice have the Mexicans before us fled, Their Armies broke, their Prince in Triumph led; Both to thy valour, brave young man, we owe; Ask thy Reward, but such as it may show It is a King thou hast oblig'd, whose Mind Is large, and like his Fortune unconfin'd. Mont. Young and a Stranger to your Court I came, There by your Favour rais'd to what I am: I Conquer but in right of your great fate, And so your Arms, not mine, are fortunate. Ynca. I am impatient till this debt be paid, Which still encreases on me while delay'd; A Bounteous Monarch to himself is kind; Ask such a Guift as may for ever bind Thy service to my Empire, and to me. Mont. What can this Guift he bids me ask him be! Perhaps he has perceiv'd our mutual fires, And now with ours wou'd crown his own Desires; 'Tis so, he sees my Service is above All other payments but his Daughters Love. [Aside. Ynca. So quick to merit, and to take so slow? I first prevent small wishes, and bestow This Prince, his Sword and Fortunes to thy hand; He's thine unask'd; Now make thy free demand. Mont. Here, Prince, receive this Sword, as only due [Gives Acacis his Sword. To that excess of Courage shown in you. When you without demand a Prince bestow, Less than a Prince to ask of you were low. Ynca. Then ask a Kingdom; say where thou wilt Reign. Mont. I beg not Empires, those my Sword can gain; But for my past and future Service too, What I have done, and what I mean to do; For this of Mexico which I have won, And Kingdoms I will Conquer yet unknown, I only ask from fair Orazia's Eyes To reap the Fruits of all my Victories. 1 Peru. Our Ynca's Colour mounts into his face. 2 Peru. His Looks speak Death. Ynca. Young man of unknown Race, Ask once again, so well thy merits plead; Thou shalt not die for that which thou hast said: The price of what thou ask'st thou dost not know; That Guift's too high. Mont. And all beside too low. Ynca. Once more I bid thee ask. Mont. Once more I make The same demand. Ynca. The Ynca bids thee take Thy choice, what Towns what Kingdoms thou wouldst have. Mont. Thou giv'st me only what before I gave. Give me thy Daughter. Ynca. Thou deserv'st to die. O thou great Author of our Progeny, Thou glorious Sun, dost thou not blush to shine, While such base Blood attempts to mix with thine! Mont. That Sun thou speakst of did not hide his face, When he beheld me Conquering for his Race. Ynca. My Fortunes gave thee thy success in Fight; Convey thy boasted Valour from my sight; I can o'recome without thy feeble aid. [Exit Ynca, Orazia, Peruvians. Mont. And is it thus my Services are paid! Not all his Guardsâ [Offers to go, Acaces holds him. Aca. Hold, Sir. Mont. Unhand me. Aca. No, I must your Rage prevent, From doing what your Reason wou'd repent; Like the vast Seas, your Mind no limits knows, Like them lies open to each Wind that blows. Mont. Can a Revenge that is so just, be ill? Aca. It is Orazia's Father you wou'd kill. Mont. Orazia, how that name has charm'd my Sword? Aca. Compose these wilde distempers in your breast; Anger like madness is appeas'd by rest. Mont. Bid children sleep, my spirits boil too high; But since Orazia's Father must not dye, A nobler vengeance shall my actions guide I'le bear the conquest, to the conquered side, Until this Ynca for my friendship sues, And proffers that his pride does now refuse. Aca. Your honor is oblig'd to keep your trust. Mont. He broke that Bond in ceasing to be just Aca. Subjects to Kings shou'd more obedience pay. Mont. Subjects are bound, not strangers to obey. Aca. Can you so little your Orazia prize, To give the conquest to her Enemies: Can you so easily forego her sight? I that hold liberty more dear then light: Yet to my freedom, shou'd my chains prefer, And think it were well lost to stay with her. Mont. How unsuccessfully I still o'recome, I brought a Rival, not a Captive home; Yet I may be deceived; but it is too late To clear those doubts, my stay brings certain fate. [aside. Come Prince, you shall to Mexico return, Where your sad Arms does your absence mourn; And in one Battle I will gain you more Then I have made you lose in three before. Aca. No Montzuma, though you change your side, I as a Prisoner am by Honor ty'd. Mont. You are my Prisoner, and I set you free. Aca. 'Twere baseness to accept such liberty. Mont. From him that conquer'd you it shou'd be sought. Aca. No, but from him for whom my Conqueror fought. Mont. Still you are mine, his gift has made you so. Aca. He gave me to his General, not his Foe. Mont. How poorly have you pleaded Honors Laws? Yet shun the greatest in your Countreyes Cause. Aca. What succour can the Captive give the Free. Mont. A needless Captive is an enemy, In painted Honor you wou'd seem to shine; But 'twou'd be clouded, were your wrongs like mine. Aca. When choller such unbridled power can have, Thy vertue seems but thy revenges slave: If such injustice shou'd my Honor stain, My aid wou'd prove my Nations loss not gain. Mont. Be cousen'd by thy guilty honesty, To make thy self thy Countreyes enemy. Aca. I do not mean in the next fight to stain My Sword in blood of any Mexican, But will be present in the fatal strife To guard Orazia's, and the Yncas life. Mont. Orazia's life fond man: first guard thy own, Her safety she must owe to me alone. Aca. Your Sword that does such wonders cannot be, In an ill cause secure of victory. Mont. Hark, hark. [noise of trampling. Aca. What noise is this invades my ears? Fly, Montzuma, fly; the guards are near To favour your retreat: I'le freely pay That life which you so frankly gave this day. Mont. I must retire, but those that follow me, Pursue their deaths, and not their victory. [Ex. Mont. Aca. Our quarrels kinder, then our friendships prove You for my Countrey fight, I for your Love. Enter Ynca and Guards. Ynca. I was to blame to leave this mad man free, Perhaps he may revolt to th'Enemy, Or stay and raise some fatal mutiny. Aca. Stop your pursuits, for they must pass through me. Ynca. Where is the slave? Aca. Gon.â Ynca. Whither? Aca. O're the plain.â Where he may soon the Camp or City gain. Ynca. Curse on my dull neglectâ And yet I do less cause of wonder finde That he is gone, then that thou stayest behinde. Aca. My treatment since you took me was so free It wanted but the name of liberty. I with less shame can still your Captive live, Then take that freedom which you did not give. Ynca. Thou brave young man, that hast thy years out-done, And losing Liberty hast Honor won: I must my self thy Honors Rival make, And give that freedom which thou wo'dst not take. Go and be safe.â Aca. But that you may be soâ Your dangers must be past before I go. Fierce Montzeuma will for fight prepare, And bend on you the fury of the War, Which by my presence I will turn away, If Fortune gives my Mexicans the Day. Ynca. Come then, we are alike to honor just, Thou to be trusted thus, and I to trust.â [Ex. all. Enter Zempoalla, Traxalla, and Attendants. Zemp. O my Acacis! Does not my grief, Traxalla, seem too rude, Thus to press out before my Gratitude Has paid my debts to you?âyet it does move My Rage and Grief, to see those Powers above Punish such men, as if they be Divine, They know will most Adore, and least Repine. Trax. Those that can only mourn when they are crost, May lose themselves with grieving for the lost. Rather to your retreated Troops appear, And let them see a Woman void of fear: The shame of that may call their Spirits home. Were the Prince safe, we were not overcom, Though we retir'd: O his too youthful heat, That thrust him were the dangers were so great! Heaven wanted power his Person to protect, From that which he had Courage to neglect: But since he's lost, let us draw forth, and pay His Fun'ral Rites in Blood; that we are they May in our Fates perform his Obsequies, And make Death Triumph when Acacis dies. Zemp. That Courage thou hast shown in Fight seems less Than this, amidst Despair to have Excess: Let thy great deeds force Fate to change her mind; He that Courts Fortune boldly makes her kind. Trax. If ere Traxalla so succesful proves, May he then say he hopes as well as Loves; And that aspiring Passion boldly own, Which gave my Prince his Fate, and you his Throne? I did not feel Remorse to see his Blood Flow from the spring of life into a flood; Nor did it look like Treason, since to me You were a Sovereign much more great than he. Zemp. He was my Brother, yet I scorn'd to pay Natures mean debts, but threw those bonds away; When his own Issue did my hopes remove, Not only from his Empire, but his Love. You that in all my wrongs then bore a part, Now need not doubt a place within my heart: I cou'd not offer you my Crown and Bed, Till Fame and Envy with long time were dead; But Fortune now does happily present Occasions fit to second my intent. Your Valour may regain the Publick Love, And make the Peoples Choice their Queens approve. [Shout Hark, hark, what noise is this that strikes my ear! Trax. 'Tis not a sound that should beget a fear; Such Shouts as these have I heard often fly From Conquering Armies crown'd with Victory. Zemp. Great God of Vengeance, here I firmly vow, Make but my Mexicans succesful now, And with a thousand Feasts thy flames I'le feed; All that I take shall on thy Altars bleed; Princes themselves shall fall, and make thy Shrine, Dy'd with their blood, in glorious blushes shine. Enter Messenger. Trax. How now!â What News is this that makes thy haste a flight? Mess. Such as brings Victory without a Fight; The Prince Acaces lives.â Zemp. Oh, I am blest.â Mess. Reserve some joy till I have told the rest. He's safe, and only wants his liberty; But that great Man that carries Victory Where ere he goes; that mighty Man by whom In three set Battels we were overcome; Ill us'd (it seems) by his ungrateful King, Does to our Camp his Fate and Valour bring. The Troops gaze on him, as if some bright Star Shot to their Aids, call him the God of War: Whilst he, as if all Conquest did of right Belong to him, bids them prepare to fight; Which if they shou'd delay one hour, he swears He'l leave them to their Dangers or their Fears, And Shame (which is th'ignoble Cowards choice.) At this the Army seem'd to have one voice, United in a shout, and call'd upon The God-like Stranger, Lead us, lead us on. Make haste, Great Sir, lest you should come too late, To share with them in Victory or Fate. Zemp. My Gen'ral go; the Gods be on our side; Let Valour act, but let Discretion guide. [Exit Traxalla. Great God of Vengeanceâ I see thou dost begin to hear me now; Make me thy Off'ring if I break my Vow. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCEN. I. Enter Ynca, Orazia, as persued in a Battle. Orazia. O fly Sir fly, like torrents your swift foes Come rowling on.â Ynca. The Gods can but destroy The noblest way to fly, is that death shows I'le court her now, since victory's grown coy. Oraz. Death's wing'd to your pursuit, and yet you wait To meet herâ Ynca. Poor Orazia, time and fate Must once o're take me, though I now shou'd fly. Oraz. Do not meet death; but when it comes then dye. Enter three Souldiers. 3. Soul. Stand Sir, and yield your self, and that fair prey. Ynca. You speak to one unpractis'd to obey. Enter Montezuma. Mont. Hold villains hold, or your rude lives shall be Lost in the midst of your own victory: These I have hunted for; nay do not stare, Be gone, and in the common plunder share. [Ex. Sould. How different is my Fate, from theirs, whose Fame From Conquest grows! from Conquest grows my shame. Ynca. Why do'st thou pause? thou canst not give me back With fruitless grief, what I enjoyed before, No more then Seas repenting of a wrack, Can with a calm our buried wealth restore. Mont. 'Twere vain to own repentance, since I know Thy scorn, which did my passions once despise, Once more would make my swelling anger flow; Which now ebbs lower then your miseries: The Gods that in my fortunes were unkinde, Gave me not Scepters, nor such gilded things; But whilst I wanted Crowns, inlarg'd my minde To despise Scepters, and dispose of Kings. Ynca. Thou art but grown a Rebel by success, And I that scorned Orazia shou'd be ty'd To thee my slave, must now esteem thee less: Rebellion is a greater guilt then pride. Mont. Princes see others faults but not their own; 'Twas you that broke that bond, and set me free: Yet I attempted not to climb your Throne, And raise my self; but level you to me. Oraz. O Montezuma, cou'd thy love engage Thy soul so little, or make banks so low About thy heart, that thy revenge and rage, Like suddain floods, so soon shou'd over-flow! Ye Gods how much was I mistaken here! I thought you gentle as the gaulless Dove; But you as humorsome as windes appear, And subject to more passions then your Love. Mont. How have I been betray'd by guilty rage, Which like a flame rose to so vast a height That nothing cou'd resist, nor yet asswage, Till it wrapt all things in one cruel fate, But I'le redeem my self, and act such things, That you shall blush Orazia was deny'd; And yet make Conquest, though with wearied wings, Take a new flight to your now fainting side. Ynca. Vain man, what foolish thoughts fill thy swell'd mind? It is too late our ruine to recal; Those that have once great Buildings undermin'd Will prove too weak to prop them in their fall. Enter Traxalla with the former Souldiers. 1 Sould. See, mighty Sir, where the bold stranger stands, Who snatch'd these glorious Prisoners from our hands. Trax. 'Tis the great Ynca, seize him as my prey, To crown the triumphs of this glorious day. Mont. Stay your bold hands from reaching at what's mine, If any title springs from victory; You safer may attempt to rob a shrine, And hope forgiveness from the Deity. Enter Acacis. Trax. O my dear Prince, my joys to see you live Are more then all that victory can give. Aca. How are my best endeavors crost by fate! Else you had ne'er been lost, or found so late. Hurried by the wilde fury of the fight, Far from your presence, and Orazia's sight, I cou'd not all that care and duty show, Which as your Captive (mighty Prince) I owe. Ynca. You often have preserv'd our lives this day, And one small debt with many bounties pay. But humane actions hang on springs that be Too small, or too remote for us to see. My glories freely I to yours resign, And am your prisoner now, that once were mine. Mont. These Prisoners Sir are mine by right of War; And I'le maintain that right, if any dare. Trax. Yes, I wou'd snatch them from thy weak defence; But that due reverence which I owe my Prince, Permits me not to quarrel in his sight, To him I shall refer his Generals right. Mont. I knew too well what justice I shou'd finde From an arm'd Plantiff, and a Judge so kinde. Aca. Unkindely urg'd, that I shou'd use thee so; Thy vertue is my Rival, not my foe; The Prisoners fortune gave thee shall be thine. Trax. Would you so great a prize to him resign? Aca. Shou'd he who boldly for his Prey design'd To dive the deepest under swelling tides, Have the less title if he chance to finde The richest Jewel that the Ocean hides? They are his dueâ But in his vertue I repose that trust, That he will be as kinde as I am just: Dispute not my commands, but go with haste, Rally our men, they may pursue too fast, And the disorders of the inviting Prey May turn again the fortune of the day. [Ex. Trax. Mont. How gentle all this Princes actions be! Vertue is calm in him, but rough in me. Aca. Can Montezuma place me in his breast? Mont. My heart's not large enough for such a guest. Aca. See Montezuma, see, Orazia weeps [Orazia weeps. Mont. Acacis, is he deaf, or waking, sleeps? He does not hear me, sees me not, nor moves; How firm his eyes are on Orazia fixt! Gods that take care of men, let not our loves Become divided by their being mixt. Aca. Weep not fair Princess, nor believe you are A Prisoner subject to the chance of War; Why shou'd you waste the stock of those fair Eyes That from mankinde can take their liberties? And you, great Sir, think not a generous mind To vertuous Princes, dares appear unkind, Because those Princes are unfortunate, Since over all men hangs a doubtful fate: One gains by what another is bereft; The frugal Deities have only left A common bank of happiness below, Maintain'd like nature, by an ebb and flow. [Ex. omnes. Zempoalla appears seated upon a Throne, frowning upon her Attendants; then comes down and speaks. Zemp. No more, you that above your Princes dare proclaim With your rebellious breath a strangers name. 1. Peru. Dread Empressâ Zemp. Slaves, perhaps you grieve to see Your young Prince glorious, 'cause he sprang from me; Had he been one of base Amexia's brood, Your tongues, though silent now, had then been loud. Enter Traxalla. Traxalla welcome, welcomer to me, Then what thou bring'st, a Crown and Victory. Trax. All I have done is nothing, fluttering fame Now tells no news, but of the Strangers name, And his great deeds; 'tis he they cry by whom Not men, but War it self is overcome; Who bold with his success, dares think to have A Prince to wear his Chains, and be his slave. Zemp. What Princeâ Trax. The great Peruvian Ynca, that of late In three set Battles was so fortunate, Till this strange man had power to turn the tide, And carry conquest unto any side. Zemp. Wou'd you permit a private man to have The great Peruvian Ynca for his slave! Shame to all Princes! was it not just now I made a sacred and a solemn vow To offer up (if blest with Victory, The Prisoners that were took) and they shall dye. Trax. I soon had snatched from this proud strangers hand That too great object for his bold demand; Had not the Prince your Son, to whom I owe A kinde obedience, judg'd it shou'd be so. Zemp. I'le hear no more; go quickly take my Guards, And from that man force those usurpt rewards; That Prince upon whose ruines I must rise Shall be the Gods, but more my sacrifice: They with my slaves in Triumph shall be tyed, While my devotion justifies my pride. Those Deities in whom I place my trust, Shall see when they are kinde, that I am just. [Ex. Zemp. Trax. How gladly I obeyâ There's something shoots through my enliven'd frame, Like a new soul, but yet without a name: Nor can I tell what the bold guest will prove, It must be Envy, or it must be love; Let it be either, 'tis the greatest bliss For man to grant himself, all he dares wish; For he that to himself, himself denies, Proves meanly wretched, to be counted wise. [Ex. Traxal. Enter Montezuma, Acacis. Aca. You wrong me, my best friend, not to believe Your kindeness gives me joy, and when I grieve, Unwillingly my sorrows I obey, Showres sometimes fall upon a shining day. Mont. Let me then share your griefs, that in your fate Wou'd have took Partâ Aca. Why shou'd you ask me that? Those must be mine, though I have such excess; Divided griefs increase, and not grow less. Mont. It does not lessen Fate, nor satisfie The Grave, 'tis true, when friends together dye; And yet they are unwilling to divide. Aca. To such a friend nothing can be deny'd You when you hear my story will forgive My grief, and rather wonder that I live. Unhappy in my Title to a Throne, Since blood made way for my succession: Blood of an Uncle too, a Prince so free From being cruel, it taught cruelty. His Queen Amexia then was big with childe; Nor was he gentler then his Queen was milde: Th'impatient people long'd for what shou'd come From such a Father, bred in such a Wombâ When false Traxalla, weary to obey, Took with his life their joyes and hopes away. Amexia by th'assistance of the night When this dark deed was acted, took her flight; Only with true Garrucca for her aid; Since when, for all the searches that were made, The Queen was never heard of more: yet still This Traytor lives and prospers by the ill: Nor does my Mother seem to reign alone, But with this Monster shares the guilt and Throne: Horror choaks up my words; now you'l believe 'Tis just I shou'd do nothing else but grieve. Mont. Excellent Prince.â How great a proof of vertue have you shown, To be concern'd for griefs, though not your own! Aca. Pray say no more.â Enter a Messenger hastily. Mont. How now, whither so fast? Messen. O Sir, I come too slow with all my haste! The fair Oraziaâ Mont. Ha, what do'st thou say? 3 Mess. Orazia with the Ynca's forc'd away Out of your Tent; Traxalla in the head Of the rude Souldiers, forc'd the door, and led Those glorious Captives, who on Thrones once shin'd, To grace the Triumph that is now design'd. [Ex. Mess. Mont. Orazia forc'd away! what tempests roul About my thoughts, and toss my troubled soul? Can there be Gods to see, and suffer this? Or does mankinde make his own fate or bliss; While every good and bad happens by chance, Not from their orders, but their ignorance But I will pull a ruine on them all, And turn their Triumph to a Funeral. Aca. Be temperate friend. Mont. You may as well advise That I shou'd have less love, as grow more wise. Aca. Yet stayâI did not think to have revealed A secret which my heart has still concealed; But in this cause since I must share with you, 'Tis fit you knowâI love Orazia too: Delay not then, nor wast the time in words, Orazia's cause calls only for our Swords. Mont. That tyes my hand, and turns from thee that rage Another way; thy blood shou'd else asswage: The storm on our proud foes shall higher rise, And changing, gather blackness as it flies: So when windes turn, the wandering waves obey, And all the Tempest rouls another way. Aca. Draw then a Rivals Sword, as I draw mine, And like friends suddenly to part, let's joyn In this one act, to seek one destiny; Rivals with honor may together dye [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCEN. I. Zempoalla appears seated upon her Slaves in Triumph, and the Indians as to celebrate the Victory, advance in a warlike Dance; in the midst of which Triumph, Acacis and Montezuma falls in upon them. Zempoalla descends from her triumphant Throne, and Acacis and Montezuma are brought in before her. Zemp. Shame of my blood, and traytor to thy own, Born to dishonor, not command a Throne; Hast thou with envious eyes my Triumph seen? Or cou'dst not see thy Mother in the Queen? Cou'dst thou a stranger above me prefer? Aca. It was my Honor made my Duty erre; I cou'd nor see his Prisoners forc'd away, To whom I ow'd my life, and you the day. Zemp. Is that young man the Warrior so renown'd? Mont. Yes, he that made thy men thrice quit their ground. Do, smile at Montezuma's chains; but know, His valour gave thee power to use him so. Trax. Grant that it did, what can his merits be, That sought his vengeance, not our victory? What has thy bruitish fury gain'd us more, Then only heal'd the wounds it gave before? Dye then, for whilst thou liv'st Wars cannot cease; Thou may'st bring Victory, but never Peace. Like a black storm thou roul'st about us all, E'ne to thy self unquiet till thy fall. [Draws to kill him. Aca. Unthankful villain, hold. Trax. You must not give Him succour, Sir. Aca. Why then I must not live. Posterity shall ne're report they had Such thankless fathers, or a Prince so bad. Zemp. You'r both too bold to will or to deny, On me alone depends his destiny. Tell me, audacious stranger, whence cou'd rise The confidence of this rash enterprize? Mont. First tell me how you dar'd to force from me The fairest spoils of my own victory? Zemp. Kill himâhold, must he dye?âwhy let him dye; Whence shou'd proceed this strange diversity In my resolves?â Does he command in chains? what wou'd he do Proud slave, if he were free, and I were so? But is he bound ye Gods, or am I free? 'Tis love, 'tis love, that thus disorders me: How pride and love tear my divided soul! For each too narrow, yet both claim it whole: Love as the younger must be forced away; Hence with the Captives (General) and convey To several Prisons thatâyoung man, and thisâ âPeruvian womanâ Trax. How concern'd she is! I must know more. Mont. Fair Princess, why shou'd I Involve that sweetness in my destiny? I cou'd out-brave my death, were I alone To suffer, but my fate must pull yours on. My breast is armed against all sence of fear, But where your image lies, 'tis tender there. Ynca. Forbear thy saucy love, she cannot be So low, but still she is too high for thee. Zemp. Be gone, and do as I command, away. Mont. I ne're was truly wretched 'till this day. Orazia. Think half your sorrows on Orazia fall, And be not so unkinde to suffer all: Patience in cowards is tame hopeless fear, But in brave mindes a scorn of what they bear. [Exit Ynca, Montezuma, Orazia, Traxalla. Zemp. What grief is this which in your face appears? Aca. The badge of sorrow, which my soul still wears. Zemp. Though thy late actions did my anger move, It cannot rob thee of a mothers love: Why shou'dst thou grieve?â Grief seldom joyn'd with blooming youth is seen, Can sorrow be where knowledge scarce has been; Fortune does well for heedless youth provide, But wisdom does unlucky age misguide; Cares are the train of present power and state, But hope lives best that on himself does wait: O happiest fortune if well understood, The certain prospect of a future good! Aca. What joy can Empire bring me, when I know That all my greatness to your crimes I owe? Zemp. Yours be the joy, be mine the punishment. Aca. In vain alas that wish to heaven is sent For me, if fair Orazia must not live. Zemp. Why shou'd you ask me what I cannot give? She must be sacrific'd: Can I bestow What to the Gods by former vows I owe? Aca. O plead not vows; I wish you had not shown You slighted all things sacred for a Throne. Zemp. I love thee so, that though fear follow still, And horror urges, all that have been ill I cou'd for theeâ Act o're my crimes agen,âand not repent, Even when I bore the shame and punishment. Aca. Cou'd you so many ill acts undertake, And not perform one good one for my sake? Zemp. Prudence permits not pity shou'd be shown To those that rais'd the War to shake my Throne. Aca. As you are wise, permit me to be just; What Prudence will not venture, Honor must; We owe our Conquest to the strangers Sword, 'Tis just his Prisoners be to him restor'd. I love Orazia, but a nobler wayâ Then for my love my Honor to betray. Zemp. Honor is but an itch in youthful blood, Of doing acts extravagantly good; We call that Vertue, which is only heat That reigns in Youth, till age findes out the cheat. Aca. Great actions first did her affections move, And I by greater wou'd regain her love. Zemp. Urge not a suit which I must still deny; Orazia and her Father both shall dye: Be gone, I'le hear no moreâ Aca. You stop your earsâ But though a Mother will not, Heaven will hear; Like you I vow, when to the Pow'rs divine You pay her guiltless Blood, I'le offer mine. [Ex. Acacis Zemp. She dyes, this happy Rival that enjoyes The strangers love, and all my hopes destroyes; Had she triumph'd, what cou'd she more have done Then robb'd the Mother, and enslav'd the Son? Nor will I at the name of cruel stay, Let dull successive Monarchs mildly sway: Their conquering Fathers did the Laws forsake, And broke the old e're they the new cou'd make. I must pursue my loveâyet love enjoy'd Will with esteem that caus'd it first grow less; But thirst and hunger fear not to be cloy'd, And when they be, are cur'd by their excess. Enter Traxalla. Trax. Now I shall see what thoughts her heart conceals; For that which Wisdom covers, Love reveals. Madam, the Prisoners are dispos'd. Zemp. They areâ And how fares our young blustering Man of War? Does he support his chains with patience yet? Trax. He and the Princess, Madam. Zemp. Are they met?â Trax. No, but from whence is all this passion grown? Zemp. 'Twas a mistake. Trax. I finde this rash Unknown Is dangerous; and if not timely slain, May plunge your Empire in new Wars again. Zemp. Thank ye, I shall consider. Trax. Is that all?â The Army doat on him, already call You cruel; and for ought I know, they may By force unchain, and crown him in a day. Zemp. You say I have already had their curse For his bad usage; shou'd I use him worse? Trax. Yet once you fear'd his reputation might Obscure the Princes in the peoples sight. Zemp. Time will inform us best what course to steer, But let us not our sacred vows defer: The Ynca and his daughter both shall dye. Trax. He suffers justly for the War; but why Shou'd she share his sad fate? a poor pretence, That birth shou'd make a crime of innocence. Zemp. Yet we destroy the poisonous Vipers young, Not for themselves, but those from whom they sprung. Trax. O no, they dye not for their Parents sake, But for the poisonous seed which they partake; Once more behold her, and then let her dye, If in that face or person you can see But any place to fix a cruelty: The heavens have clouds, and spots are in the Moon; But faultless beauty shines in her alone. Zemp. Beauty has wrought compassion in your minde. Trax. And you to valour are become as kinde. To former services there's something due. Yet be advisedâ Zemp. Yes by my self, not youâ Trax. Princes are sacred. Zemp. True, whilst they are free; But power once lost, farewell their sanctity: 'Tis power to which the Gods their worship owe, Which, uncontroul'd, makes all things just below: Thou, do'st the plea of saucy rebels use, They will be judge of what their Prince must chuse: Hard fate of Monarchs, not allow'd to know When safe, but as their Subjects tell them so. Then Princes but like publick pageants move, And seem to sway because they sit above. [Ex. Zemp. Trax. She loves him; in one moment this new guest Has drove me out from this false womans breast; They that wou'd fetter Love with constancy Make bonds to chain themselves, but leave him free. With what impatience I her falshood bear! Yet do my self that which I blam in her; But Interest in my own Cause makes me see That Act unjust in her, but just in me. [Exit Traxalla. Ismeron asleep in the Scene. Enter Zempoalla. Zemp. Ho, Ismeron, Ismeron. He stirs not; ha, in such a dismal Cell Can gentle Sleep with his soft blessings dwell? Must I feell tortures in a humane brest, While Beasts and Monsters can enjoy their Rest? What quiet they possess in sleeps calm bliss! The Lions cease to roar, the Snakes to hiss, While I am kept awakeâ Only to entertain my Miseries. Or if a slumber steal upon my Eyes, Some horrid Dream my lab'ring Soul benums, And brings Fate to me sooner then it comes. Fears most oppress when sleep has seiz'd upon The outward parts, and left the Soul alone. What envy'd blessing's these curs'd things enjoy! Next to possess, 'tis pleasure to destroy. Ismeron; ho Ismeron, Ismeron. [Stamps. Ism. Who's that with so loud and fierce a call Disturbs my rest? Zemp. She that has none at all, Nor ever must, unless thy powerful Art Can charm the passions of a troubled heart. Ism. How can you have a discontented mind, To whom the Gods have lately been so kind? Zemp. Their envious kindness how can I enjoy, When they give Blessings, and the use destroy? Ism. Dread Empress, tell the cause of all your grief; If Art can help, be sure of quick Relief. Zemp. I dream'd before the Altar that I led A mighty Lion in a twisted thred; I shook to hold him in so slight a tie, Yet had not power to seek a remedy: When in the midst of all my fears a Dove, With hovering wings, descended from above, Flew to the Lion, and Embraces spread, With Wings, like clasping Arms, about his head Making that murm'ring noise that cooing Doves Use in the soft expression of their Loves. While I, fix'd by my wonder, gaz'd to see So mild a Creature with so fierce agree, At last the gentle Dove turn'd from his head, And pecking try'd to break the slender thred, Which instantly she sever'd, and releas'd From that small bond the fierce and mighty Beast, Who presently turn'd all his rage on me, And with his Freedom brought my Destiny. Ism. Dread Empress, this strange Vision you relate Is big with wonder, and too full of fate Without the Gods assistance to expound. In those low Regions where sad Night hangs round The drowsie Vaults, and where moist Vapors steep The God's dull brows that sways the Realm of Sleep; There all th'informing Elements repair, Swift Messengers of Water, Fire, and Air, To give account of Actions whence they came, And how they govern every mortal fram; How from their various mixture, or their strife, Are known the Calms and Tempests of our Life: Thence Souls, when Sleep their Bodys overcom, Have some imperfect knowledg of their doom. From those dark Caves those Powers shall strait appear; Be not afraid whatever shapes they wear. Zemp. There's nothing thou canst raise can make me start; A living form can only shake my heart. Ism. You twice Ten Hundred Deities, To whom we daily Sacrifice; You Powers that dwell with Fate below, And see what men are doom'd to do; Where Elements in discord dwell; Thou God of Sleep arise and tell Great Zempoalla what strange Fate Must on her dismal Vision wait. Zemp. How slow these Spirits are! Call, make them rise, Or they shall fast from Flame and Sacrifice. Ism. Great Empressâ Let not your rage offend what we adore, And vainly threaten, when we must implore. Sit and silently attend,â While my powerful Charms I end. By the croaking of the Toad, In their Caves that make aboad, Earthy Dun that pants for breath, With her swell'd sides full of death; By the Crested Adders Pride That along the Clifts do glide; By thy visage fierce and black; By the Deaths-head on thy back; By the twisted Serpents plac'd For a Girdle round thy Waste. By the Hearts of Gold that deck Thy Brest, thy Shoulders, and thy Neck: From thy sleepy Mansion rise, And open thy unwilling Eyes, While bubling Springs their Musick keep, That use to lull thee in thy sleep. [God of Dreams rises. God. Seek not to know what must not be reveal'd; Joys only flow where Fate is most conceal'd: Too-buisie Man wou'd find his Sorrows more, If future Fortunes he shou'd know before; For by that knowledg of his Destiny He wou'd not live at all, but always die. Enquire not then who shall from bonds be freed, Who 'tis shall wear a Crown, and who shall bleed: All must submit to their appointed doom; Fate and Misfortune will too quickly come: Let me no more with powerful Charms be prest, I am forbid by Fate to tell the rest. [The God descends. Zemp. Stay Couz'ner, thou that hat'st clear truth like light, And usest words dark as thy own dull night. You Tirants Gods do you refuse to free The Soul you gave from its perplexity? Why shou'd we in your mercies still believe, When you can never pity though we grieve? For you have bound your selves by harsh decrees; And those, not you, are now the Deities. [Sits down sad. Ism. She droops under the weight of Rage and Care: You Spirits that inhabit in the Air, With all your powerful Charms of Musick try To bring her Soul back to its harmony. SONG is suppos'd sung by Aerial-Spirits. Poor Mortals that are clog'd with Earth below Sink under Love and Care, While we that dwell in Air Such heavy Passions never know. Why then shou'd Mortals be Unwilling to be free From Blood, that sullen Cloud, Which shining Souls does shroud? Then they'l shew bright, And like us light, When leaving Bodies with their Care, They slide to us and Air. Zemp. Death on these Trifles: Cannot your Art find Some means to ease the Passions of the Mind? Or if you cannot give a Lover rest, Can you force Love into a Scornful Brest? Ism. 'Tis Reason only can make Passions less; Art gives not new, but may the old encrease; Nor can it alter Love in any Brest That is with other flames before possess'd. Zemp. If this be all your slighted Art can do, I'le be a Fate both to your Gods and you; I'le kindle other Flames, since I must burn, And all their Temples into ashes turn. Ism. Great Queen. Zemp. If you wou'd have this Sentence staid, Summon their Godheads quickly to your aid, And presently compose a Charm that may Loves flames into the Strangers brest convey, The Captive Stranger, he whose Sword and Eyes Where ere they strike meet ready Victories: Make him but burn for me in flames like mine, Victims shall bleed, and feasted Altars shine: If notâ Down go your Temples, and your Gods shall see They have small use of their Divinity.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. SCEN. I. The Scene opens and discovers Montezuma sleeping in Prison. Enter Traxalla leading in Orazia. Trax. Now take your choice, and bid him live or die; To both shew Pity or shew Cruelty: 'Tis you that must condemn, I'le only act; Your Sentence is more cruel than my Fact. Oraz. You are most cruel to disturb a mind Which to approaching Fate was so resign'd. Trax. Reward my Passions, and you'l quickly prove There's none dare sacrifice what I dare love. Next to thee, Stranger, wake, and now resign The bold pretences of thy Love to mine, Or in this fatal minute thou shalt findeâ Mont. Death, fool; in that thou maist be just and kind: 'Twas I that lov'd Orazia, yet did raise The storm in which she sinks: why dost thou gaze, Or stay thy hand from giving that just stroke, Which rather than prevent, I wou'd provoke? When I am dead Orazia may forgive; She never must, if I dare wish to live. Oraz. Hold, holdâO Montezuma, can you be So careless of your self, but more of me? Though you have brought me to this misery, I blush to say I cannot see you die. Mont. Can my approaching Fate such pity move? The Gods and you at once forgive and love. Trax. Fond fool, thus to mispend that little breath I lent thee to prevent not hasten Death: Let her thank you she was unfortunate, And you thank her for pulling on your fate; Prove to each other your own Destinies. [Draws. Enter Zempoalla hastily, and sets a Dagger to Orazia's breast. Zemp. Hold, hold, Traxalla, or Orazia dies. O, is't Orazia's Name that makes you stay? 'Tis her great Power, not mine, that you obey. Inhumane wretch, dar'st thou the murtherer be Of him that is not yet condemn'd by me? Trax. The wretch that gave you all the pow'r you have, May venture sure to execute a Slave; And quench a flame your fondness would have burn, Which may this City into ashes turn. The Nation in your guilty passion lost, To me ungrateful, to your Country most: But this shall be their Offering, I their Priest. Zemp. The wounds thou giv'st I'le copy on her brest. Strike, and I'le open here a spring of blood, Shall add new Rivers to the crimson flood. How his pale looks are fix'd on her!â'tis so. Oh, does amazement on your spirit grow? What, is your publick Love Orazia's grown? Cou'dst thou see mine, and yet not hide thy own? Suppose I shou'd strike first, wou'd it not breed Grief in your publick heart to see her bleed? Trax. She mocks my passions, in her sparkling eyes Death and a close dissembled fury lies: I dare not trust her thus.âIf she must die, The way to her lov'd Life through mine shall lie. [He puts her by and steps before Orazia, and she runs before Montezuma. Zemp. And he that does this Strangers fate design, Must to his heart a passage force through mine. Trax. Can fair Orazia yet no pity have? 'Tis just she shou'd her own Preserver save. Zemp. Can Montezuma so ungrateful prove To her that gave him Life, and offers Love? Oraz. Can Montezuma live, and live to be Just to another, and unjust to me? You need not be ungrateful; can she give A Life to you, if you refuse to live? Forgive me Passion, I had rather see You dead, than kind to any thing but me. Mont. O my Orazia! To what new joys and knowledg am I brought! Are deaths hard lessons by a Woman taught? How to despise my Fate I always knew; But ne're durst think at once of death and you: Yet since you teach this generous jealousie, I dare not wish your life, if I must die. How much your Love my Courage does exceed! Courage alone would shrink to see you bleed. Zemp. Ungrateful Stranger, thou shalt please thy eyes, And gaze upon Orazia while she dies. I'le keep my Vow:âIt is some joy to see That my Revenge will prove my Piety. Trax. Then both shall die; we have too long withstood, By private Passions urg'd, the Publick good. Zemp. Sure he dissembles, and perhaps may prove My ruine with his new ambitious Love: Were but this stranger kind, I'de cross his Art, And give my Empire where I gave my heart. [Aside. Yet thou ungrateful man, Let thy approaching ruine make thee wise. Mont. Thee and thy Love and Mischief I despise. Zemp. What shall I do?âsome way must yet be try'd. What Reasons can she use whom Passions guide? Trax. Some black designs are hatching now; false Eyes Are quick to see anothers Treacheries. Zemp. Rash Stranger, thus to pull down thy own fate. Mont. You, and that life you offer me, I hate. Enter Jaylor. Zemp. Here Jaylor,âtakeâwhat title must he have? SlaveâSlaveâAm I then Captive to a Slave! Why art thou thus unwilling to be free? Mont. Death will release me from these Chains and thee. Zemp. Here Jaylor, take this Monster from my sight, And keep him where it may be always night; Let none come neer him; if thou dost, expect To pay thy life the price of the Neglect. Mont. I scorn thy Pity and thy Cruelty, And shou'd despise a Blessing sent from thee. Zemp. Oh horror to my Soul! take him away; My Rage like damb'd up Streams swell'd by some stay Shall from this opposition get new force, And leave the bound of its old easie course. Come my Traxalla, let us both forgive, And in these Wretches Fates begin to live. The Altars shall be crown'd with Fun'ral Boughs, Peace-offrings pay'd,âbut with unquiet Vows. [Ex. Zem. Tr. Oraz. How are things ordered, that the wicked shou'd Appear more kind and gentle than the good! Her Passion seems to make her kinder prove, And I seem cruel through excess of Love: She loves, and wou'd prevent his death; but I That love him better, fear he shou'd not die. My Jealousie, immortal as my Love, Wou'd rob my Grave below, and me above, Of Rest.âYe Gods, if I repine, forgive; You neither let me die in Peace, nor live. Enter Acacis, Jaylor, and Indians. Jaylor. They are just gone, Sir. Aca. 'Tis well: be faithful to my just design, And all thy Princes Fortune shall be thine. [Exit Acacis. Indian. This shall to the Empress. [Exit Indian. Oraz. What can this mean!â 'Twas Prince Acacis, if I durst believe My sight; but Sorrow may like Joy deceive: Each object different from it self appears, That comes not to the Eyes but through their Tears. Enter Acacis bringing in Montezuma. Ha!â Aca. Here, Sir, wear this again; Now follow me. Mont. So, very good;â I dare not think, for I may guess amiss; None can deceive me while I trust to this. [Exeunt Omnes. Enter Orazia, conducted by two Indians with their Swords drawn: Montezuma, Acacis, whispering another Indian. Aca. Think what a weight upon thy faith I lay. Ind. I ne're did more unwillingly obey. Aca. First Montezuma, take thy liberty; Thou gav'st me freedom, here I set thee free; We're equal now. Madam, the danger's great Of close pursuit; to favour your Retreat Permit we two a little while remain Behind, while you go softly o're the Plain. Oraz. Why shou'd I go before? what's your intent? Where is my Father? whither am I sent? Aca. Your doubts shall soon be clear'd. Conduct her on. So, Montezuma, we are now alone: [Exit Orazia. That which my Honour ow'd thee I have paid; As Honour was, so Love must be obey'd. I set Orazia as thy Captive free, But as my Mistress ask her back from thee. Mont. Thou hast perform'd what Honour bid thee do; But Friendship bars what Honor Prompts me to. Friends shou'd not fight. Aca. If Friendship we profess, Let us secure each others happiness; One needs must die, and he shall happy prove In her Remembrance, t'other in her Love. My Guards wait neer, and if I fail they must Give up Orazia, or betray their trust. Mont. Suppose thou conquerst, wou'dst thou wander o're The South-Sea Sands, or the rough Northern Shore, That parts thy spacious Kingdom from Peru; And leaving Empire, hopeless Love pursue? Aca. By which of all my actions cou'd you guess, Though more your merit, that my Love was less? What prize can Empire with Orazia bear? Or where Love fills the brest, what room for Fear? Mont. Let fair Orazia then the Sentence give, Else he may die whom she desires to live. Aca. Your greater merits bribe her to your side; My weaker Title must by Arms be try'd. Mont. Oh Tyrant Love, how cruel are thy Laws! I forfeit Friendship, or betray thy Cause. That Person whom I wou'd defend from all The World, that Person by my hand must fall. Aca. Our Lives we to each others Friendships owe; But Love calls back what Friendship did bestow: Love has its Cruelties, but Friendship none; And we now fight in Quarrels not our own. [Fight. Enter Orazia. Oraz. What noise is this?â Hold, hold; what cause cou'd be so great to move This furious hatred?â Mont. 'Twas our furious Love.â Aca. Love which I hid till I had set you free, And bought your pardon with my liberty: That done, I thought I less unjustly might With Montezuma for Orazia fight; He has prevail'd, and I must now confess His fortune greater, not my passion less; Yet cannot yield ye till his Sword remove, A dying Rival that holds fast his Love. Orazia. Who ever falls, 'tis my Protector still, And then the crime's as great to dye as kill. Acacis, do not hopeless love pursue, But live, and this soft malady subdue. Aca. You bid me live, and yet command me dye, I am not worth your care, fly Madam, fly, While I fall here unpittied, o're this Plain Free from pursuit, the faithless Mountains gain; And these I charge as they wou'd have me think their friendship true. Leave me alone to serve and follow you: Make haste fair Princess to avoid that fate, Which does for your unhappy Father wait. Orazia. Is he then left to dye, and shall he see Himself forsaken, e're his death, by me? Mont. What wou'd you doâ Orazia. To Prison I'le return, And there in fetters with my father mourn. Mont. That saves not his, but throws your life away. Orazia. Duty shall give what nature once must pay. Aca. Life is the gift, which Heaven and Parents give, And duty best preserves it, if you live. Orazia. I shou'd but further from my fountain fly, And like an unfed stream run on and dye: Urge me no more, and do not grieve to see Your Honor rival'd by my Piety. [Exit. She goes softly off, and often looks back. Mont. If Honor wou'd not, shame wou'd lead the way. I'le back with her. Aca. Stay Montezuma stayâ Thy Rival cannot let thee go alone, My love will bear me, though my blood is gone. [As they are going of. Enter Zempoalla, Traxalla, the Indian that went to tell her, and the rest, and seizes them. Zemp. Seize themâ Aca. Oh Montezuma, thou art lost. [Orazia comes back. Mont. No more proud heart, thy useless courage boast. Courage thou curse of the unfortunate, That canst encounter, not resist ill fate. Zemp. Acacis bleeds.â What barbarous hand has wounded thus my Son? Mont. 'Twas I, by my unhappy Sword it was done. Thou bleed'st poor Prince, and I am left to grieve My Rivals fall. Trax. He bleeds, but yet may live. Aca. Friendship and love my failing strength renew, I dare not dye when I shou'd live for you; My death were now my crime, as it wou'd be My guilt to live when I have set you free: Thus I must still remain unfortunate, Your life and death are equally my fate. [Orazia comes back. Orazia. A noise again, alas what do I see! Love thou didst once give place to Piety: Now Piety, let Love triumph a while; Here binde my hands: come Montezuma smile At Fortune, since thou sufferest for my sake, Orazia will her Captives chains partake. Mont. Now fate thy worst. Zemp. Lead to the Temple straight, A Priest, and Altar for these Lovers wait: They shall be joyn'd, they shall. Trax. And I will proveâ Those joyes in vengeance, which I want in love. Aca. I'le quench your thirst with Blood, and will destroy My self, and with my self, your cruel joy. Now Montezuma since Orazia dyes, I'le fall before thee, the first Sacrifice; My title in her death shall exceed thine, As much as in her life, thy hopes did mine: And when with our mixt blood the Altar's dy'd. Then our new Title let the Gods decide. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. SCEN. I. The Scene opens, and discovers the Temple of the Sun all of Gold, and four Priests in habits of white, and red Feathers attending by a bloody Altar, as ready for sacrifice. Then Enter the Guards, and Zempoalla, and Traxalla; Ynca, Orazia, and Montezuma bound; as soon as they are plac'd the Priest sings. SONG. You to whom Victory we owe, Whose glories rise By sacrifice, And from our fates below; Never did yet your Altars shine Feasted with Blood so nere divine; Princes to whom we bow, As they to you, These you can ravish from a throne, And by their loss of power declare your own. Zemp. Now to inflict those punishments that are Due to the Authors of invasive War; Who to deceive the oppressed world, like you, Invent false quarrels to conceal the true. Ynca. My quarrel was the same that all the Gods Must have to thee, if there be any oddes Betwixt those Tytles that are bad or good, To Crowns descended or usurpt by Blood: Swell not with this success, 'twas not to thee, But to this man the Gods gave Victory. Mont. Since I must perish by my own success, Think my misfortunes more, my Crimes the less; And so forgiving make me pleas'd to dye, Thus punish'd for this guilty victory. Ynca. Death can make vertue easie; I forgive: That word wou'd prove too hard were I to live; The Honor of a Prince wou'd then deny, But in the Grave all our distinctions dye. Mont. Forgive me one thing yet; to say I love Let it no more your scorn or anger move, Since dying in one flame, my ashes must Embrace and mingle with Orazia's dust. Ynca. Name thy bold love no more, lest that last breath Which shou'd forgive, I stifle with my death. Orazia. Oh my dear Father! Oh, why may not I, Since you gave life to me, for you now dye? Mont. 'Tis I that wrought these mischief ought to fall; A just and willing sacrifice for all. Now Zempoalla, be both just and kinde, And in my fate let me thy mercy finde: Be grateful then, and grant me that esteem, That as I live, so dead I may redeem. Oraz. O do not for her cruel mercy move; None shou'd ask pitty but from those they love. [Weeps. Ynca. Fond girle, to let thy disobedient eyes Show a concern for him whom I despise. Orazia. How love and nature may divide a breast, At once by both their Pow'rs severely prest! Yet Sir, since love seems less, you may forgive, I wou'd not have you dye, nor have him live; Yet if he dyes, alas what shall I do? I cannot dye with him, and live with you. Mont. How vainly we pursue this generous strife, Parting in death more cruel then in life! Weep not, we both shall have one destiny, As in one flame we liv'd, in one we'l dye. Trax. Why do we waste in vain these precious hours? Each minute of his life may hazzard ours: The Nation does not live whilst he enjoyes. His life, it is his safety that destroyes. He shall fall first, and teach the rest to dye. Zemp. Holdâ Who is it that commandsâha, you or I? Your zeal grows saucy; sure you may allow Your Empress freedom first to pay her vow. Trax. She may allowâa justice to be done By him that rais'd his Empress to her Throne. Zemp. You are too boldâ Trax. And you too passionate. Zemp. Take heed with his, you urge not your own fate. For all this pitty is now due to mee. Mont. I hate thy offer'd mercy more then thee. Trax. Why will not then the fair Orazia give Life to her self, and let Traxalla live? Mont. Orazia will not live, and let me dye; She taught me first this cruel jealousie. Orazia. I joy that you have learn'd itâ That flame not like immortal love appears Where death can cool its warmth, or kill its fears. Zemp. What shall I do? am I so quite forlorn, No help from my own pride, nor from his scorn! My Rivals death may more effectual prove, He that is rob'd of hope, may cease to love: Here, lead these Offerings to their deaths. Trax. Let noneâ Obey, but he that will pull on his own. Zemp. Tempt me not thus, false and ingrateful too. Trax. Just as ungrateful, and as false as you. Zemp. 'Tis thy false loue that fears her destiny. Trax. And your false love that fears to have him dye. Zemp. Seize the bold Traytor. Trax. What a slighted frown Troubles your brow? feared nor obeyed by none; Come prepare for sacrifice. Enter Acacis weakly. Aca. Hold, hold, such sacrifice cannot be, Devotion's but a solemn cruelty How can the Gods delight in humane blood? Think 'um not cruel; if you think 'um good. In vain we ask that mercy which they want, And hope that pitty which they hate to grant. Zemp. Retire Acacisâ Preserve thy self, for 'tis in vain to waste Thy breath for them: the fatal vow is past. Aca. To break that vow is juster then commit A greater crime by your preserving it. Zemp. The Gods themselves their own will best express To like the vow, by giving the success. Aca. If all things by success are understood, Men that make War, grow wicked to be good: But did you vow those that were overcome, And he that conquered both shou'd share one doom. There's no excuse; for one of these must be Not your devotion, but your cruelty. Trax. To that rash stranger Sir we nothing owe, What he had rais'd he strove to overthrow: That duty lost which shou'd our actions guide, Courage proves guilt, when merits swell to pride. Aca. Dar'st thou who didst thy Princes life betray, Once name that duty thou hast thrown away: Like thy injustice to this stranger shown, To tax him with a guilt that is thy own?â Can you brave Souldiers suffer him to dye, That gave you life in giving victory? Look but upon this stranger, see those hands, That brought you freedom fetter'd up in bands. Not one looks upâ Least suddain pitty shou'd their hearts surprize, And steal into their bosoms through their eyes. Zemp. Why thus in vain are thy weak spirits prest, Restore thy self to thy more needful rest. Aca. And leave Oraziaâ Zemp. Go you must resignâ For she must be the Gods, not yours nor mine. Aca. You are my Mother, and my tongue is ti'd, So much by duty that I dare not chide. Divine Oraziaâ Can you have so much mercy to forgive? I do not ask it with design to live, But in my death to have my torments cease: Death is not death when it can bring no peace. Orazia. I both forgive and pittyâ Aca. O say no more, lest words less kinde destroy, What these have rais'd in me of peace and joy; You said you did both pitty and forgive, You wou'd do neither shou'd Acacis live. By death alone the certain way appears, Thus to hope mercy and deserve your tears. [Stabs himself. Zemp. O my Acacis!â What cruel cause cou'd urge this fatal deed! [Weeps. He faints, help, help, some help or he will bleed, His life and mine away: Some water thereâNot one stirs from his place; I'le use my tears to sprinkle on his face. Aca. Orazia.â Zemp. Fond childe, why do'st thou call upon her name? I am thy Mother. Aca. No, you are my shame, That blood is shed that you had title in, And with your title may it end your sin: Unhappy Prince, you may forgive me now, Thus bleeding for my mothers cruel vow. Ynca. Be not concern'd for meâ Death's easier then the changes I have seen, I wou'd not live to trust the world again. Mont. Into my eyes sorrrow begins to creep, When hands are ty'd it is no shame to weep. Aca. Dear Montezuma. I may be still your Friend, though I must dye Your Rival in her love; Eternity Has room enough for both, there's no desire, Where to enjoy is only to admire: There we'l meet friends, when this short storm is past. Mont. Why must I tamely wait to perish last? Aca. Orazia weeps, and my parch't soul appears Refresh'd by that kinde shower of pittying tears; Forgive those faults my passion did commit, 'Tis punish'd with the life that nourish'd it: I had no power in this extremity To save your life, and less to see you dye. My eyes wou'd ever on this object stay, But sinking Nature takes the props away. âKinde deathâ To end with pleasures all my miseries Shuts up your image in my closing eyes. [Dyes. Enter a Messenger. 1 Mess. To Armes, to Armes. Trax. From whence this suddain fear? 1 Mess. Stand to your guard my Lord, the danger's near: From every quarter crowds of people meet, And leaving houses empty, fill the street. [Ex. Mess. Trax. Fond Queen, thy fruitless tears a while defer. Rise, we must joyn againâNot speak nor stir! I hear the peoples voice like windes that roar, When they pursue the flying waves to shore. Enter second Messenger. 2 Messen. Prepare to fight my Lord; the Banisht Queen, With old Garrucca in the streets are seen. Trax. We must go meet them ere it be too late; Yet Madam rise, have you no sence of fate. Enter third Messenger. 3 Messen. King Montezuma their Lord shouts proclaim, The City rings with their new Sovereigns name; The banish'd Queen declares he is her Son, And to his succor all the people run. [Zempoalla rises. Zemp. Can this be true? O Love! O Fate! have I Thus doated on my mortal enemy. Trax. To my new Prince I thus my homage pay; Your Reign is short young King. Zemp. Traxalla stayâ 'Tis to my hand that he must owe his fate, I will revenge at once my love and hate. [She sets a Dagger to Montezuma's breast. Trax. Strike, strike, the conquering enemy is near, My guards are press'd while you detain me here. Zemp. Dye then ungrateful, dye; Amexia's Son Shall never triumph on Acacis Throne: Thy death must my unhappy flames remove; Now where is thy defenceâagainst my love? [She cuts the cords, and gives him the Dagger. Trax. Am I betrayed? [He draws and thrusts at Montezuma, he puts it by and kills him. Mont. So may all Rebels dye: This end has treason joyn'd with cruelty. Zemp. Live thou whom I must love, and yet must hate; She gave thee life, who knows it brings her fate. Mont. Life is a trifle which I wou'd not take, But for Orazias and her fathers sake: Now Ynca hate me, if thou canst; for he Whom thou hast scorn'd will dye or rescue thee. [As he goes to attaque the Guards with Traxalla's Sword Enter Amexica, Garrucca, Indians, driving some of the other Party before them. Gar. He lives, ye Gods, he lives great Queen, see here Your coming joyes, and your departing fear. Amex. Wonder and joy so fast together flow, Their haste to pass has made their passage slow; Like struggling waters in a Vessel pent, Whose crowding drops choak up the narrow Vent. My Son.â [She imbraces him. Mont. I am amaz'd, it cannot beâ That fate has such a joy in store for me. Amex. Can I not gain belief, that this is true? Mont. It is my fortune I suspect, not you. Gar. First ask him if he old Garrucca know. Mont. My honored Father, let me fall thus low. Gar. Forbear great Prince, 'tis I must pay to you That adoration, as my Sovereigns due: For from my humble race you did not spring, You are the issue of our murthered King, Sent by that Traytor to his blest abode, Whom to be made a King, he made a God: The story is too full of fate to tell, Or what strange fortune our lost Queen befel. Amex. That sad relation longer time will crave; I liv'd obscure, he bred you in a Cave, But kept the mighty secret from your ear, Lest heat of blood to some strange course shou'd steer Your youthâ Mont. I owe him all that now I am, He taught me first the noble thirst of fame, Shewd me the baseness of unmanly fear, Till th'unlick'd whelp I pluck'd from the rough Bear, And made the Ounce and Tyger give me way, While from their hungry jaws I snatch'd the Prey: 'Twas he that charg'd my young armes first with toils, And drest me glorious in my salvage spoils.â Gar. You spent in shady Forests all the day, And joy'd returning to shew me the Prey. To tell the story, to describe the place, With all the pleasures of the boasted chase; Till fit for armes, I reav'd you from your sport, To train your Youth in the Peruvian Court: I left you there, and ever since have been, The sad attendant of my exil'd Queen. Zemp. My fatal Dream comes to my memory; That Lion whom I held in bonds was he, Amexia was the Dove that broke his chains; What now but Zempoalla's death remains? Mont. Pardon fair Princess if I must delay My love a while, my gratitude to pay. Live Zempoallaâfree from dangers live For present merits I past crimes forgive: Oh might she hope Orazia's pardon too.â Orazia. I wou'd have none condemn'd for loving you; In me her merit much her fault o're powers, She sought my life, but she preserv'd me yours. Amex. Taught by my own I pitty her estate, And wish her penitence, but not her fate. Ynca. I wou'd not be the last to bid her live; Kings best revenge their wrongs when they forgive. Zemp. I cannot yet forget what I have been, Wou'd you give life to her that was a Queen: Must you then give, and must I take; there's yet One way, that's by refusing to be great: You bid me liveâbid me be wretched too, Think, think, what pride unthron'd must undergo: Look on this youth Amexia, look, and then Suppose him yours, and bid me live again; A greater sweetness on these lips there grows, Then breath shut out from a new folded Rose: What lovely charms on these cold cheeks appear, Cou'd any one hate death and see it here? But thou art goneâ Mont. O that you wou'd believe Acacis lives in me, and cease to grieve. Zemp. Yes, I will cease to grieve, and cease to be His soul stayes watching in his wound for me; All that cou'd render life desir'd is gone, Orazia has my love, and you my Throne: And death Acacisâyet I need not dye, You leave me Mistriss of my destiny; In spight of dreams how am I pleas'd to see, Heavens truth or falshood shou'd depend on me; But I will help the Gods; The greatest proof of courage we can give, Is then to dye when we have power to live. [Kills her self. Mont. How fatally that instrument of death Was hidâ Amex. She has expir'd her latest breath. Mont. But there lies one to whom all griefs is due. Orazia. None e're was so unhappy and so true. Mont. Your pardon royal Sir. Ynca. You have my Love. [Gives him Oraz. Amex. The Gods my Son your happy choice approve. Mont. Come my Orazia then, and pay with me, [Leads her to Acaces. Some tears to poor Acacis memory; So strange a fate for men the Gods ordain Our clearest Sun shine shou'd be mixt with rain; How equally our joyes and sorrows move! Deaths fatal triumphs joyn'd with those of love. Love crowns the dead, and death Crowns him that lives, Each gains the Conquest which the other gives. [Ex. omnes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue to the INDIAN QUEEN, Spoken by Montezuma. You see what Shifts we are inforc'd to try To help out Wit with some Variety; Shows may be found that never yet were seen, 'Tis hard to finde such Wit as ne're has been: You have seen all that this old World cou'd do, We therefore try the fortune of the new, And hope it is below your aim to hit At untaught Nature with your practic'd Wit: Our naked Indians then, when Wits appear, Wou'd as soon chuse to have the Spaniards here: 'Tis true, y'have marks enough, the Plot, the Show, The Poets Scenes, nay, more the Painters too: If all this fail, considering the cost, 'Tis a true Voyage to the Indies lost: But if you smile on all, then these designs, Like the imperfect Treasure of our Mindes, 'Twill pass for currant wheresoe're they go, When to your bounteous hands their stamps they owe.
