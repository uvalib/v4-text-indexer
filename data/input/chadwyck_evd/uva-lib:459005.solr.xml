      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Home-bred mirth our Muse doth sing, The Satyres tooth and Waspish sting, Which most do hurt when least suspected, By this Play are not affected; But if Conceit with quick-turn'd Sceanes, Obseruing all those ancient streames, Which from the Horse-foot fount do flow, As Time, Place, Person, and to show, Things neuer done with that true life, That thoughts and wits shall stand at strife, Whether the things now shewne be true, Or whether wee our selues now do The things wee but present: if these Free from the loathsome stage disease, (So ouer-worne, so tirde and stale, Not Satyring but to raile,) May win your fauours, and inherit But calme acceptance for his merit: A vowes by Paper, Pen and Inke, And by the learned Sisters drinke, To spend his Time, his Lamps, his Oyle, And neuer cease his braine to toyle, Till from the silent houres of night, Hee doth produce for your delight, Conceits so new, so harmlesse free, That Puritanes them-selues may see A Play, yet not in publique Preach, That Players such lewd doctrine teach That their pure ioynts do quake and tremble, UUhen they doe see a man resemble The Picture of a Uillaine: This As hee a friend to Muses is, To you by mee a giues his word, Is all his Play doth now affoord.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus 1. ScÃ¦na 1, Enter Constantia sola, with a letter in her hand. Const. In this disguise, (ere scarce my mourning robes) Could haue a generall note, I haue forsooke, My shape, my mother, and those ritch demeanes, Of which I am sole heyre, and now resolue, In this disguise of Page to follow him, Whose loue first caused me to assume this shape. Lord how my feminine bloud stirs at the sight Of these same breeches, me thinkes this cod-peece Should betray mee: well, I will trye the worst, Hether they say hee vsually doth come, Whom I so much affect, what makes he heere In the skirts of Holborne, so neere the field, And at a garden house, a has some punke Vpon my life: no more heere hee comes. Enter Boutcher. God saue you sir: your name vnlesse I erre, Is maister Thomas Boutcher. Bou. 'Tis sweet boy. Con. I haue a letter for you. Con. deliuers the lett. Bou. From whom ist, he reads it. Con. The inside sir will tell you: I shall see What loue he beares me now. Bou. Th'art welcome boy. How does the faire Constantia Somerfield, My noble mistresse. Con. I left her in health. Bou. Shee giues thee heere good words, and for her sake, Thou shalt not want a maister, be mine for euer. Con. I thanke you sir: now shall I see the Punke. he knocks Enter William Small-shanke. W. Sm. Who knocks so fast? I thought 'twas you, what news. Bout. You know my businesse well, I sing one song. W. Sm. Foot, what would you haue me do, my land is gon, My credit of lesse trust then Courtiers words To men of iudgment, and for my debts I might deserue a Knight-hood; what's to be done? The Knight my father will not once vouchsafe To call me sonne; That little land a gaue; Throte the Lawyer swallowed at one gob, For lesse then halfe the worth, and for the Citty There be so many rascals, and tall yeomen Would hang vpon me for their maintenance, Should I but peepe or step within the gates, That I am forst onely to ease my charge, To liue here in the suburbes: or in the towne To walke in Tenebris, I tell you sir, Your best retierd life is an honest Punke In a thatcht house with Garlike: tell not mee, My Punk's my Punke, and noble Letchery Sticks by a man, when all his friends forsake him. Bou. The Poxe it will, art thou so sencelesse growne, So much indeared to thy bestiall lust, That thy originall worth should lye extinct And buried in thy shame? farre be such thoughts From spirits free and noble: begin to liue, Know thy selfe, and whence thou art deriu'd, I know that competent state thy father gaue, Cannot be yet consum'd. W. S. 'Tis gon by Heauen, Not a denier is left. Bou. 'Tis impossible. W. S. Impossible zart I haue had two suckers, Able to spend the wealthy CrÃ¦sus store. Enter Francis. Bou. What are they? W. S. Why a Lawyer and a Whore, See heere comes one, doost thinke this petti-coate, A perfum'd smock, and twice a weeke a bathe, Can be maintain'd with halfe a yeares reuenews, No by Heauen, wee Annuall yonger brothers, Must go to't by hole-sale, by hole-sale man These creatures are maintaind: her very face Has cost a hundred pound. Fra. Sir, thanke your selfe. Con. They keepe this whore betwixt them. Fra. You know sir, I did inioy a quiet country life, Spotlesse and free, till you corrupted mee, And brought me to the Court, I neuer knew, What sleeking, glazing, or what pressing meant, Till you preferd me to your Aunt the Lady, I knew no Iuorie teeth, no caps of heire, No Mercury water, fucas, or perfumes, To helpe a Ladies breath, vntill your Aunt, Learnt me the common trick. W. S. The common trick, Say you, a poxe vpon such common tricks, They will vndoe vs all. Bou. And knowing this Art thou so wilfull blind, still to persist In ruine and defame. W. S. What should I doe? I'aue past my word to keepe this Gentlewoman, Till I can place her to her owne content, And what is a Gentleman but his word. Bou. Why let her goe to seruice. W. S. To seruice, Why so shee does, she is my Landeresse, And by this light, no punie Inne a Court But keepes a Landresse at his command To doe him seruice, and shall not I, ha! Fra. Sir, you are his friend (I loue him to) Propound a course which may aduantage him, And you shall finde such reall worth in me, That rather then Ile liue his hindrance, I will assume the most penurious state The Citty yeelds, to giue me meanes of life. W. S. Why ther's it, you heare her what she sayes, Would not he be damn'd that should forsake her, Sayes she not well, can you propound a course, To get my forfit land, from yonder roague, Parcell Lawyer, parcell Deuill, all Knaue, Thrate, throate. Bou. Not I. W. S. Why so, I thought as much, You are like our Cittizens to men in need, Which cry 'tis pitty, a propper Gentleman, Should want mony, yet not an vsuring slaue, VVill lend him a denier, to helpe his wants, Will you lend mee forty shillings. Bou. I will. W. S. VVhy God-amercy, there's some goodnesse in thee, Youle not repent. Bou. I will not. VV. S. VVith that money I will redeeme my forfit land, and wed My Coccatrice to a man of worship, To a man of worship by this light. Bou. But how? W. S. Thus in Ramme-alley lies a fellow, by name Throte: one that professeth law, but indeed Has neither law nor conseience, a fellow That neuer saw the barre, but when his life Was cald in question for a coosenage, The Rogue is riche, to him go you, tell him That rich Sir Iohn Somerfield. Con. How's that? W. Is lately dead, and that my hopes stand faire To get his onely daughter. If I speed, And haue but meanes to steale away the wench, Tell him I reckon him my chiefest friend, To entertaine vs till our nuptiall rites May be accomplisht, and could you but procure My elder brother meete me on the way, And but associate me vnto his house, 'Tweare hit ifaith, I'de giue my cunning Throte An honest slit for all his tricks in lawe. Bou. Why this shall be perform'd, take ther's my store, To friends all things are common. W. S. Then at the court There are none foes, for all things there are common. Bou. I will as carefully performe thy wish, As if my fortunes lay vpon th'attempt. W. S. When shall I heere from you. Bou. Within this houre W. S. Let me alone for the rest, if I gull not And go beyond my open throted lawyer, For all his booke cases of Tricesimo nono And Quadragessimo octauo: let mee Like waiting Gentlewomen be euer bound, To sit vpon my heeles, and pick rushes, Will you about this geere. Bou. With my best speed. W. S. Then fare you well, yole meete me. Bou. Without faile. Exit Bouch: and Page. W. S. Adue: now you pernicious Coccatrice, You see how I must skelder for your good, Ile bring you where you shall haue meanes to cheate, If you haue grace enough to apprehend it. Fra. Beleeue me loue, how ere some stricter wits, Condemne all women which are prone to loue, And thinke that if their fauour fall on any, By consequence they must be naught with many, And hold a false position, that a woman False to her selfe, can trusty be to no man, Yet know I say, how ere my life hath lost The fame which my Virginity aspyr'd, I will be true to thee, my deed shall mooue, To win from all men pitty, if not loue. W. S. Tut, I know thee a good rascall, lets in, And on with all your neate and finest ragges. On with your cloake and saue-gard, you arrant drab, You must cheate without all conscience, filtch for thee &amp; me. Do but thou act what I shall well contriue, Weele teach my Lawyer a new way to thriue. Exeunt. Enter Mistresse Tafata, and Adriana her maid aboue. Taf. Come lou'd Adriana heere let vs sit, And marke who passes; now for a wager, What colourd bear'd comes next by the window? Adr. A black mans I thinke. Taf. I thinke not so, I thinke a redde, for that is most in fashion, Lord how scarce is the world of propper men And gallants; sure wee neuer more shall see A good legge worne in a long silke stocking, With a long cod-peece, of all fashions That carried it ifaith, what's he goes by? Enter a Cittizen. Adr. A sniueling Cittizen, he is carrying ware, Exit. Vnto some Ladies chamber: but whoe's this? Enter T. Smal-shanke reading a letter. Taf. I know him not, a lookes iust like a foole. Adr. He's very braue a may be a Courtier, Whats that a reads. Taf. Ah how light a treads For durting his silke stockings, Ile tell thee what, A witty woman may with ease distinguish, All men by their noses, as thus: your nose Tuscan is louely, large and brawde, Much like a Goose, your valiant generous nose. A croked smoth and a great puffing nose, Your schollers nose is very fresh and raw For want of fire in winter, and quickly smells, His choppes of mutton, in his dish of porrage. Your Puritan nose is very sharpe and long, And much like your widdows, and with ease can smell, An edefying capon some fiue streets off, Enter Boutcher and Constantia. Adr. O mistris a very proper gentleman, Tafa. And trust me so it is, I neuer saw A man that sooner could captiue my thoughts (Since I writ widdow) then this gentleman, I would a would looke vp. Adr. Ile laugh so loud That he may here me. Tafa. Thats not so good Bou. And spake you with Maister Smalshanke. Con. I did. Bou. Will a meete his brother. Con. A said a woud, And I beleeued him, I tell you maister I haue done that for many of these gallants That no man in this towne would do but I. Bo. Whats is that boy. Con. Why trust them on their words But will you heare the newes which now supplies, The citty with discourse. Bou. What is it wag Con. This sir, they say some of our citty dames Were much desirous to see the Baboones Doe their newest trickes, went, saw them, came home, Went to bed, slept, next morning one of them, Being to shift a smocke, sends downe her maide, To warme her one, meane while she gins to thinke On the Babones tricks, and naked in her bed Begins to practise some, at last she stroue, To gett her right leg ouer her head; thus: And by her actiuity she got it Crosse he shoulder: but not withall her power, Could she reduce it, at last much strugling Tumbles quite from the bed vpon the flower, The maide by this return'd with the warme smocke, And seeing her mistris throwne on the ground Trust vp like a foote-ball, exclaimes, calles helpe, Runnes downe amazd, sweares that her mistris necke Is broke vp comes her husband and neighbours, And finding her thus trus'd, some flatly said She was bewitch, others she was possest, A third said for her pride, the Diuell had set Her face where her rumpe should stand, but at last Her valiant husband steppes me boldly to her, Helpes her; she a shamed; her husband amazed, The neighbours laughing as none forbeare, She tells them of the fatall accident. To which one answers, that if her husband Would leaue his trade, and carry his wife about To doe this tricke in publike, she'd get more gold Then all the Babones, Calues with two tayles, Or motions whatsoeuer. Bou. You are a wag, Taf. He wilbe gone if we neglect to stay him. Adr. Shall I cough or sneeze. Taf. Noe I ha't stand a side, Aye me my handkertcher Adriand, Fabia. Adr. Mistris, Taf. Runne, runne I haue let my handkertcher fall, Gentleman shall I intreate a curtesie, Bur. Within my power your beauty shall command. What curtesie ist. Tas. To stoope and take vp, My handkertcher. Bou. Your desire is performd. Taf. Sir most hearty thankes: please you come in Your welcome shall transcend your expectation. Bou. I accept your curtesie, ha! whats this? Assayld by feare and hope in a moment. Boucher this womanish passion fits not men, Who know the worth of freedome: shall smyles and eyes With their lasciuious glances conquer him Hath still beene Lord of his affections? Shall simpring nisenesse load-stones but to fooles, Attract a knowing spirrit: it shall, it dooes, Not PhÃ¦bus rising from Auroras lap, Spreds his bright raies with more maiestique grace Then came the glances from her quickning eye And what of this. Con. By my troth I know not Bou. I will not enter: continued flames burne strong, I yet am free and reason keepes her seate, Aboue all fond affections yet is she fayre. Enter Adriana. Adr.

Whose witty knaue art thou. Con. At your seruice. Ad. At mine faith, I should breetch thee. Con. How breetch me. Adr. I breetch thee, I haue breetch a taler man, Then you in my time, come in and welcome. Con. Well I see now a ritch well-practis'd baud, May pursse more fees in a summers progresse, Then a well traded lawier in a whole terme, Pandarisme! why't is growne a liberall science Or a new sect, and the good professors Will like the Brownist frequent grauell pits shortly, For they vse woods and obscure holes already. Enter Tafata and Boucher. Not marry a widdow. Bou. No. Taf. And why? Belike you thinke it base and seruant-like, To feed vpon reuersion, you hold vs widdowes, But as a pie thrust to the lower end That hath had many fingers int before, And is reseru'd for grose and hungry stomackes. Bou. You much mistake me. Taff. Come in faith you do: And let me tell you thats but ceremony, For though the Pye bee broken vp before, Yet sayes the prouerbe, the deeper is the sweeter. And though a capons wings and legges be caru'd, The flesh left with the rumpe I hope is sweet. I tell you sir, I haue beene woed, and sued to, By worthy Knights of faire demeanes: nay more, They haue bin out of debt, yet till this houre, I neither could indure, to be in loue.

But know thou wonder of this continent, By one more skyld in vnknowne fate, then was, The blind Achaian Prophet, It was foretold, A widdow should indanger both my life, My soule, my lands, and reputation, This cheks my thoughs, and cooles th'ssentiall fire, Of sacred loue; more ardent in my brest Then speech can vtter. Taf. A triuiall Idle ieast, Tis for a man, of your repute, and note, To credit fortunetellers, a petty rogue, That neuer saw fiue shillings, in a heape Will take vpon him to diuine mens fate, Yet neuer knowes himselfe, shall die a begger, Or be hanged vp for pilfering table cloaths, Shirts and smocks, hanged out to dry on hedges, Tis meerely base, to trust them, or if there be, A man in whome the Delphicke, God hath breathed, His true diuining fire, that can foretell, The fixt decree of fate, he likewise knowes, What is within the euerlasting booke, Of Desteny decreed cannot by wit, Or mans Inuention be disolued, or shund, Then giue thy loue free scope imbrace and kisse, And to the distafe sisters leaue th'euent, Bou. How powerfull are their words whome we affect, Small force shall need, to winne the strongest fort, If to his state the Captaine be perfidious, I must intreate you licence my depart For some few houres.

A ha, h'is in ifaith, Yo'aue drawne him now within your purlews mistresse. Bou. Tut I will not loue, my rationall And better parts shall conquer blind affections, Let passion children, or weake women sway, My loue shall to my iudgement still obay. Taf. What does he now? Adr. H'is gon. Taf. Gon Adriana, Adr. A went his way, and neuer lookt behind him. Taf. Sure he's taken. Adr. A little sing'd or so, Each thing must haue beginning, men must prepare Before they can come on, and show their loues In pleasing sort: the man will doe in time, For loue good Mistresse is much like to waxe, The more 'tis rub'd, it sticks the faster too, Or like a bird in bird-lime, or a pit-fall, The more a labours, still the deeper in. Taf. Come, thou must helpe me now, I haue a trick To second this beginning, and in the nick, To strike it dead ifaith, women must woe, When men forget what Nature leads them too. Enter Throte the Lawyer from his study bookes and bags of money on a Table, a chaire and cushion. Thr. Chast PhÅbe, splende; there's that left yet, Next to my booke, Claro micante Auro, I that's the soule of lawe: that's it, that's it, For which the Buckrome bag must trudge all weathers: Though scarcely fild with one poore replication, How happy are we that wee ioy the law, So freely as we doe; not bought and sold, But clearely giuen, without all base extorting, Taking but bare ten Angels for a fee, Or vpward: to this renown'd estate, Haue I by indirect and cunning meanes, In-wouen my selfe, and now can scratch it out, Thrust at a barre, and cry my Lord as low'd, As ere listed gowne-man of them all. I neuer plead before the honor'd bench, But bench right-worshipfull of peacefull Iustices And Country-Gentlemen, and yet I'aue found Good gettings by the Masse, besides od cheates, VVill Small-shankes lands and many garboyles more, Dash.

Then he forsweares his father, 'tis well, Some of our clients will go prig to hell Before ourselues; has a paide all his fees. Das. A left them all with me. Thr. Then trusse my points, And how thinkst thou of law? Das. Most reuerently, Law is the worlds great light, a second sunne, To this terrestriall Globe, by which all things Haue life and being, and with-out which Confusion and disorder soone would seaze The generall state of men, warres, outrages, The vlcerous deeds of peace, it curbes and cures, It is the kingdomes eye, by which she sees The acts and thoughts of men. Thr. The kingdomes eye, I tell thee foole, it is the kingdomes nose, By which she smells out all these rich transgressors, Nor ist of flesh but meerely made of wax, And tis, within the power of vs Lawiers, To wrest this nose of waxe which way we please. Or it may be as thou saist an eye indeed. But if it be tis sure a womans eye knocke within. Thats euer rowling. Das. one knocks. Thr.

How wed to ritch Sommerfields onely heyre, Is old Sommerfield dead? Bou. Do you make it strang? Thr. By heauen I know it nor. Bou. Then am I greeued. I spake so much (but that I know you loue him. And is reseru'd for grose and hungry stomackes. Bou. You much mistake me. Taff.

Bouch. Measure for a Lawyer, but to the poynt Has stole Somerfields heyre hether a brings her As to a man on whom a may rely His life and fortunes: you hath a named Already for the Steward of his lands, To keepe his Courts, and to collect his rent, To let out Leases and to rayse his fines, Nothing that may, or loue, or profit bring, But you are named the man. Thr. I am his slaue And bound vnto his noble curtesie- Euen with my life, I euer said a would thriue, And I protest I kept his forfeit morgage, To let him know what tis to liue in want. Bour. I thinke no lesse, one word more in priuate. Con. Good Maister Dash shall I put you now a case. Dash. Speake on good Maister Page. Con. Then thus it is, Suppose I am a Page, he is my Maister, My Maister goes to bed and cannot tell What monei's in his hose, I ere next day Haue filcht out some, what action lies for this. Dash. An action boy, cald firking the Posteriors, With vs your action sildome comes in question: For that tis knowne that most of your Gallants Are sildome so well stor'd, that they forget What mone'is in theyr hose, but if they haue, There is noe other helpe then sweare the page And put him to his oath. Con, Then fecks-law, Dost thinke that he has conscience to steale, Has not a conscience likewise to deny. Then hange him vp ifayth. Bou. I must meete him, Thr. Commend me to them, come when they will, My dores stand open and all within is theirs And though Ramme stinks with Cookes and ale, Yet say thers many a worthy lawyers chamber, Buts vpon Rame-alley, I haue still an open throte, If ought I haue which may procure his good, Bid him command, I, though it be my blod.

I like that well, Were the Rogue a Lawyer, but he is none, He neuer was of any Inne-of-court; But Inne of Chancery, where a was knowne, But onely for a swaggering whyfler, To keepe out rogues, and prentises, I saw him, When a was stockt for stealing the cookes fees.

Ex: Enter Throte and Francis. Thr. Open your case, and I shall soone resolue you. Fra. But will you do it truly. Thr. As I am honest. Fra. This Gentleman whom I so much affect, I scarsly yet doe know, so blind is loue, In things which most concernes it, as y'are honest Tell me his birth, his state, and farthest hopes. Thr. He is my friend, and I will speake him truly, He is by birth, sonne to a foolish Knight, His present state I thinke will be the prison, And farthest hope to be baild out againe, By sale of all your land. Fra. O mee accurst, Has a no credit, Lands and Mannors. Thr. That lands he has lyes in a faire Church-yard, And for his manners, they are so rude and vilde, That scarce an honest man will keepe him company. Fra. I am abus'd, coosned, and deceiu'd. Thr. Why that's his occupation, hee will cheate In a cloake lin'd with Veluet, a will prate Faster then fiue Barbers and a Taylor, Lye faster then ten Citty occupiers, Or cunning tradesmen: goes a trust In euery Tauerne where has spent a fagot, Sweares loue to euery whore, squires bawdes, And takes vp houses for them as their husband. A is a man I loue, and haue done much To bring him to preferment. Fra. Is there no trust, No honesty in men. Thr. Faith some there is, And 'tis all in the hands of vs Lawyers And women, and those women which haue it, Keepe their honesty so close, that not one Amongst a hundred is perceiued to haue it. Fra. Good sir, may I not by law forsake him And wed another, though my word be past To be his wife. Thr. O questionlesse you may, You haue many Presidents and booke-cases for't, Nay, though you were married by a booke-case, Of Milesimo sexantesimo, &amp;c. You may forsake your husband, and wed another, Prouided that some fault be in the husband, As none of them are cleare. Fra. I am resolu'd, I will not wed him, though I beg my bread. Thr. All that I haue is yours, and were I worthy To be your husband. Fra. I thanke you sir, I will rather wed a most perfidious Redshanke, A noted Iewe, or some Mechanick slaue, Then let him ioy my sheets. Thr. A comes, a comes, Enter W. Smal. Boutcher, T. Smal. Beard. W.

Most true, Better to wed another, then to returne With scandall and defame: wed me a man Whose wealth may reconcile your mothers loue, And make the action lawfull. Bea. But where's the man? I like your councell, could you show the man. Thr. My selfe am he, might I but dare aspyre Vnto so high a Fortune. Bea. Mistrisse, take the man, Shall we be baffled with faire promises, Or shall we trudge, like beggers back againe, No, take this wise and vertuous man, Who should a lose his legges, his armes, his eares, His nose, and all his other members, Yer if his tongue be left 'twill get his liuing, Take me this man. Thr. Thankes gentle maister Beard. Fra. 'Tis impossible, this night he meanes to wed mee. Thr. If not by law, we will with power preuent it, So you but giue consent. Fra. Lets heere the meanes. Thr.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus 4. ScÃ¦na. 1. Sir Oliuer, Iustice Tutchim, Taffata, Adriana. S. Ol. Good meate the belly fils, good wine the braine, Women please men, men pleasure them againe, Ka me, ka thee, one thing must rub another, English loue Scots, VVelshmen loue each other. I. Tu. You say very right sir Oliuer, very righr, I haue't in my noddle ifaith, That's all the fault Old Iustices haue, when they are at feasts, They wil bib hard, they wilbe fine: Sun-burnt Sufficient, foxt, or Columberd now and than, Now could I sit in my charyre at home and nod A drunkard to the stocks, by vertue of, The last statute farely. Taf. Sir you are merry, I. Tu. I am indeed. Taf. Your supper sir was light. But I hope you thinke you welcome. I. Tu. I doe, A light supper quoth you, pray God it be, Pray god I carry it cleanly, I am shure it lies, As heauy in my belly as moult lead, Yet Ile goe see my Sister Sommerfield, Si. O. So late good Iustice. I. Tu. I euen so late, Night is the mother of wit, as you may see, By Poets or rather Cunstables In their examinations at midnight, Weele lie together without marrying, Saue the Curats fees, and the parish a labour, Tis a thriuing course. S. Ol. That may not be, For excomunications then will flee. I. Tu. Thats true, they fly indeed like wild-geese, In flocks, one in the breech of another. But the best is a small matter stayes them, And so farwell. S. O. Farwell good Iustice Tutchim, Exit. Alasse good gentleman his braines are erased, But let that passe: speake widdow ist a match, Shall we clap it vp. Adr. Nay if't come to clapping, Good night ifaith Mistris looke before you, Theres nothing more dangerous to maide or widdow, Then suddaine clapings vp; nothing has spoyld, So many proper ladies as clappings vp: Your shittill-cocke, striding from tables to ground, Onely to try the strength of the backe, Your riding a hunting, I though they fall, With their heels vpward, and lay as if They were taking the height, of some high starre With a crosse staffe: noe nor your iumlings In horsslitters, coatches or caroatches, Haue spoyld so many women as clappings vp, Si. Ol. Why then weele chop it vp. Taf. Thats not alowed. Vnlesse you were sonne to a welch Curate: But faith sir Knight I haue a kind of Itching, To be a Lady, that I can tell you woes, And can perswade with better rethorick, Then oathes, wit, welth, valour, lands, or person, I haue some debts at court, and marrying you, I hope the Courtier will not sticke to pay me, Si. Ol. Neuer feare thy payment. This I will say, For Courtiers theyle be shure to pay each other, How ere they deale with Cittizens. Ta. Then heres my hand, I am your wife condition we be ioynd, Before to morrows sunne. Si. O. Nay euen to night, So you be pleas'd with little warning widdow, We old men can be ready, and thou shalt see, Before the time that chanticlere, Shall call and tell the day is neere, When wentches lying on their backs, Receiue with ioy their loue-stolne smacks, When maids awak't from their first sleepe, Deceiu'd with dreames begin to weepe, And thinke if dreames, sutch pleasures know, What sport the substance them would show, When Ladies gin white Lymmes to spred, Her loue but new stolne to her bed, His cotten showes yet scarce put off, And deares not laugh, speake, sneze, or cough, When precise dames begin to thinke, Why their grose souring husbands stincke, What pleasure twere then to inioy, A nimble vickar, or a boy. Before this time thou shalt behold, Me quaffing out our brydall bole. Adr. Then belike before the morning Sunne You wil be coupled. Taf. Yes faith Adriana, Adr. Well I will looke you shall haue a cleane smocke, Prouided that you pay the fee Sir Oliuer, Since my Mistris sir will be a Lady, Ile loose no fees due to the wayting maid. S. Ol. Why is there a fee belonging to it. Adr. A Knight and neuer heard of smocke fees, I would I had the monopoly of them, So there were no impost set vpon them: Enter W. Sm. S. Ol. Whom haue wee heere what my mad-headed sonne What makes he here so late? say I am gone, And I the whilest will step behind the hangings. W. S. God Blesse thee parcell of mans flesh, Ta. How sir. W. S. Why parcell of mans flesh art not a woman? But widdow whers the old stinkerd my father, They say widdow you dance altogether. After his pipe. Ta. What then. W. S. Thar't a foole, Ile assure thee theres no musick in it. Ta. Can you play better. W. S. Better widdow? Bloud dost thinke I haue not learnt my pricke song, What not the court prick song? one vp and another downe, Why I haue't to a hare by this light, I hope thou louest him not. Ta. Ile marry him sir, W. S. How marry him, foote art mad widdow, Woot marry an old crased man, With meager lookes, with visage wan, With littell legs and cryncled thies, With Chapfalne gummes and deepe sunke eyes, Why a dog seazd on ten daies by death Stinkes nor so loathsome as his breath, Nor can a citty common iaques, Which all mens Breeches vndertakes, Yeeld fasting stomakes such a fauour. As doth his breath, and vgly fauour. S, O. Rogue, Adr. Thats all one sir she meanes to be a Lady, W. S. Does she so, and thou must be her waiting woman. Faith thou wilt make a fine dainty creature, To sit at a chamber doore and looke fleas, In thy Ladies dog while she is showing, Some slippery britcht Courtier rare faces, In a by window, foote widdow, Marry me a young and compleate gallant, Taf. How a compleat gallant? what? a fellow, With a hat tuck't vp behind, and what we vse, About our hips to keepe our coates from dabling, He weares about his neeke, a farthingale: A standing coller to keepe his neate band cleane, The whilst his shirt does stinke, and is more foule, Then an in of chancery table cloth, His breeches must be pleyted as if a had Some thirty pockets, when one poore halpeny purse, Will carry all his treasure, his knees all points, As if his legs and hammes were tyde together, A fellow that has noe inside, but prates By roate, as players, and parrotts vse to doe, And to define a compleat gallant right, A mercer form'd him, a taylor made him, And a player giues him spright, Wi. Sm. Why so, in my conscience to be a Countesse, Thou wouldst marry a hedg-hog: I must confesse, Tis state to haue a coxe-combe kisse your hands, While yet the chamberly is scarse wypte off, To haue an vpright vsher march before you, Bare headed in a Tuftafata ierkin Maide of your old cast gowne, shewes passing well, But when you feele your husbands pulses, thats hell, Then you fly out and bid straite smockes farwell, Taf, I hope sir what ere our husbands be, We may be honest. W. S. May be; nay y'are, Women and honesty are as neere alyde, As parsons liues are to their doctrines, One and the same: but widdow now be ruld, I hope the heauens will giue thee better grace, Then to accept the father and I yet liue, To be bestowed, if you wed the stinckerd, You shall find the tale of Tantalus To be noe fable widdow. Si. Ol. How I sweate, I can hold noe longer, degenerate bastard, I here disclayme thee, casheere thee, nay more, I disinherit thee both of my loue. And liuing, get thee a gray cloake and hat And walke in Paules amongst thy casheerd mates As malancholly as the best: Taf. Come not neere me, I forbid the my house, my out-houses, My Garden, Orchard, and my backe-side, Thou shalt not harbor neere me. Sir Ol. Nay to thy greefe, Know varlet I will be wed this morning, Thou shalt not bee there, nor once be grac'd With a peece of Rosemary: Ile casheere thee, Do not reply, I will not stay to heare thee. Exit. W. Sm: Now may I goe put me on a cleane shirt And hang my selfe, foot who would haue thought The Foxe had earth'd so neere me; whats to bee done? What miracle shall I now vndertake To winne respectiue grace with God and men? What if I turn'd Courtier and liu'd honest? Sure that would do it: I dare not walke the streets, For I dwindle at a Sargeant in buffe Almost as much as a new Player does At a plague bill certified forty: Well I like this widdow, a lusty plumpe drab Has substance both in bretch and purse, And pitty and sinne it were she should be wed To a furd cloacke and a night-cap. Ile haue her, This widdow I will haue: her money Shall pay my debts and set me vp againe, Tis heere, tis almost forg'd, which if it take, The world shall praise my wit, admire my fate. Exit.

That's nothing, I haue brought you furniture, come get vp Vp vpon this table, doe your feates, Or I will whip you to them, doe not I know You are a lowsie knaue. Cap. How? Lowsie knaue, Are wee not English bred? Bou. Y'are a coward Roague. That dares not looke a Kitling in the face, If she but stare or mew. Cap.

No by this good light, Ile play Him that goes with the motions. Dra. Wher's the Cap. Gentlemen? W. S. Stand back boy, and be a spectator, Gentlemen You shall see the strange nature of an out-landish beast, That ha's but two legs, bearded like a man, Nosd like a Goose, and toungd like a woman, Lately brought from the land of Catita, A beast of much vnderstanding, were it not giuen Too much to the loue of Venery: do I not do it well? Bou. Admirably. W. S. Remember noble Captaine, You skip when I shall shake my whip: Now sit, What can you doe for the great Turke? What can you doe for the Pope of Rome? Harke, he stirreth not, he moueth not, he waggeth not, What can you do for the towne of Geneua sirra? He holds vp his hands insteed of praying. Con. Sure this Baboune is a great Puritane. Bou. Is not this strange. W. S. Not a whit by this light, Bankes his horse and hee were taught both in a stable. Dr. O rare. Cap. Zounes Ile first be dam'nd, shall sport Bee laught at; by Dis, by Pluto, and great Proserpine, My fatall blade once drawne, falls but with death, Yet if youle let me goe, I vow by Ioue, No widdow, maide, wife, punke, or Cockatrice, Shall make me haunt your goasts. Bou. 'Twill not serue sir, You must shew more. Cap. Ile first be hangd and damn'd. W. S. Foote can a iumpe so well. Bou. Is a so quick? I hope the slaue will haunt no more the widdow. W. S. As for that take no care, for by this light Sheele not haue thee. Bou. Not haue me? W. S. No not haue thee, By this hand, flesh, and bloud, she is resolu'd To make my father a most fearefull Cuckold, And he's resolu'd to saue his soule by her. Bou. How by her? W. S. Thus, all old men which marry Young wiues, shall questionlesse be sau'd, For while th'are young, they keepe other mens wiues, And when th'are old, they keepe wiues for other men, And so by satisfaction procure saluation. Why thou deiected taile of a Crab, Does not the faire Constantia Somerfield Doate on thy filthy face; and wilt thou wed A wanton widdow? what canst thou see To doate on her. Bou. Onely this, I loue her. W. S. Doo'st loue her then, take a purgation, For loue Ile assure thee is a binder: Of all things vnder heauen, there's no fitter parralells then a Drunkard and a Louer: for a drunkard looses his sences, so does your louer; your drunkard is quarrelsome, so is your louer: your drunkard will sweare, lye, and speake great words, so will your louer: your drunkard is most desirous of his letchery, and so is your louer: Well the night growes old, farewell: I am so much thy friend, that none shall bed thee, While faire Constantia is resolu'd to wed thee. Ex. Enter Thomas Smal-shank and others. T. S. Foote shall we let the wentch goe thus, My masters now show your selues Gentlemen And take a way the Lawiers wife; Foote though I haue noe wit, yet I can, Loue a wentch and choose a wife, Gen. Why sir, what should you doe with a wife, that are held none of the wisest? youle get none but fooles. Th. S. How fooles, why may not I a foole get a wise child as well as wise men get fooles: all lies but in the agillity of the woman: introth I thinke all fooles are got when there mothers asleepe; therefore Ile neuer ly with my wife but when she is brawd waking, stand to't honest friends, knocke downe the Lieftenant and then hurry the wentch to Fleet-streete, there my father and I will this morning be married. Enter Beard and Francis, Gen. Stand close they come. Bea. By Ioue the night growes darke and Luna lookes, As if this hower some fifty cuckolds were making, Then let vs trudge. Gen. Downe with 'em, downe with them, away with her Maister Smal-shankes to Fleetestreet, goe the Curate there staies for you. Bea. And stayes the Curat. Whats here knockt downe, and blud of men let out, Must men in darkenesse bleed, then Erebus looke big, And Boreas blow the fire of all my rage, Into his nose. Night thou art a whore, Smalshanke a rogue: and is my wench tooke from me, Sure I am guld, this was no Coccatryce, I neuer saw her before this day-light peept, What dropst thou head, this surely is the heyre, And mad will Smal-shankes lay in Ambuscado, To get her now from me, Beard: Lieftenant Beard, Thou art an asses what a dull slaue was I, That all this while smelt not her honesty. Pate I doe not pitty thee: hadst thou braines, Lieftenant Beard had got this wealthy heyre, From all these rogues, bloud to be this orereachd, In pate and wench: reueng, reuenge come vp, And with thy curled locks cling to my beard, Smale-shamkes I will betray thee: I now will trudge, To Saint Iohnsstreete to informe the Lady Sommerfield, Where thou art: I will preuent the match, Thou art to Fleetestreet gone, reuenge shall follow, And my incensed wrath shall like great thunder, Dispersse thy hopes and thy braue wife a sunder. Enter Lady Sommerfield, and Iustice Tutchin. Tu. Say as I say widdow, the wench is gon, But I know whether, stolne she is, well. I know by whome, say as I say widdow, I haue bin drinking hard, why say so too, Old men they can be fine, with small a doe, The law is not offended, I had no punke, Nor in an alehouse, haue I made me drunke. The statute is not broke, I haue the skill, To drinke by law, then say as I say still, La. S. To what extremes doth this licentious time, Hurry vnstayed youth, nor Gods nor Lawes, Whose penall scurges are inough to saue, Euen damned fiends, can in this looser age, Confine vnbounded youth, who durst presume, To steale my youths delight, my ages hope, Her fathers heyre, and the last noble stemme, Of all her ancestors: feare they or Gods or lawes. I. Tu. I say as you say sister, but for the lawes, There are so many that men do stand in awe, Of none at all; take heed they steale not you. Who woes a widow with a faire full Moone Shall surely speed, beware of full Moones widdow, Will Smalshankes has your daughter no word but mum, My warrant you shall haue when time shall come. La. S. your warrant? I. Tu. I my warrant widdow. My warrant can stretch far; no more but so, Twill serue to ketch a knaue, or fetch a Doe. Enter Seruingmen. Ser. Heres a gentleman much desirous to see you madam. La. So. What is a for a man. Ser. Nothing for a man, but much for a beast, I thinke him lunatique for a demannds, What plate of his is stirring i'the house, A calls your men his Butlers, Cookes, and Steward, Kisses your woman, and makes exceeding much Of your Coach-mans wife; I. Tu. Then he's a gentleman, for tis a true note of a gentleman, to make much of other mens wiues, bring him vp, a sirra, makes a much of your Choachmans wife, this geere will runne a wheeles then shortly, A man may make much more of a nother mans wife, then a can do of's owne. L. S. How much brother? I. Tu. A man may make with ease, A Punke, a Child, a Bastard, a Cuckold, of another mans wife all at a clap. And that is much I thinke. Seru. Thats my Lady. Enter Seruingman and Throte. Thr. For that thou first hast brought me to her sight, I here create thee Clarke a the Kitching, no man shall beg it from thee. Ser. Sure the fellowes mad. L. S. What would you sir? I gesse your long profession, By your scant suite: your habit seemes to turne: Your inside outward to me; y'are I thinke. Some Turner of the law. Thr. Law is my liuing. And on that auncient mould I weare this outside, Suite vpon suite wasts some yet makes me thriue. First lawe, then gold, then loue, and then we wiue. I. T. A man of forme like me but what's your businesse? La. Be briese good sir: what makes this bold intrusion? Th. Intrude, I do not, for I know the lawe, It is the rule that squares out all our actions, Those actions bring in coyne, coyne gets me friends, Your sonne in law hath law at's fingers ends. La. My sonne in law. Th. Madame your sonne in law, Mother I come, (be glad I call you so) To make a gentle breach into your fauour, And win your approbation of my choice, Your cherry-ripe sweet daughter (so renownd, For beauty, vertue, and a wealthy dowre) I haue espousd. La. How? you espouse my daughter? Thr. Nouerint vniuersi, the lawes of heauen, Of nature, church, and chance, haue made her mine, Therefore deliuer her by these presents. I. Tu. How's this? made her yours sir? per quam regulam, Nay we are letter'd sir, as well as you, Redde rationem per quam regulam. Thr. Femini ludificantur viros: By that same rule these lips haue taken season, Tut I do all by Statute law, and reason. La. Hence you base knaue, you petty-fogging groome, Clad in old ends, and peec'd with Brokery, You wed my daughter? I. T. You sir Ambo-dexter, A Sumners sonne, and learn't in Norfolke wiles, Some common baile, or Counter Lawyer, Marry my neece? your halfe sleeues shall not carry her. Thr. These Stormes will be dissolu'd in teares of ioy, Mother I doubt it not: Iustice to you, That ierke at my halfe sleeues, and yet your selfe Doe neuer weare but Buckerom out of sight, A Flannell wast-coate, or a Canuas Trusse, A shift of thrift, I vse it: let's be friends, You know the law hath tricks, ka me, ka thee, Viderit vtilitas, the mott to these halfe armes, Corpus cum causa needs no bumbasting. We weare small hayre yet haue we tongue and wit, Lawyers close breech't haue bodies pollitick. La. Speake, answer me sir Iack: stole you my daughter? Thr. Short tale to make, I fingered haue your daughter, I haue tane liuery and season of the wench, Deliuer her then, you know the Statute lawes, Shee's mine without exception, barre or clause: Come, come, restore. La. The fellow's mad I thinke, Thr. I was not mad before I married, But ipso facto what the act may make me, That know I not. I. T. Fellows come in there, Ent. 2. or 3. Ser. By this sir you confesse you stole my Neece And I attach you heere of fellony: Lay hold on him: Ile make my Mittimus, And send him to the Iayle; haue we no barre Nor clause to hamper you, away with him, Those clawes shall claw you to a barre of shame, Where thou shalt shew thy Goll, Ile barre your claime, If I be Iustice Tutchin. Thr. Hands off you slaues, Oh! fauour my Ierkin, though you teare my flesh, I set more store by that: my Audita Querela shall be heard, and with a Certiorare Ile fetch her from you with a pox. Enter Beard. Bea. What's heere to do? is all the world in armes? More tumults, brawles, and insurrections, Is bloud the Theame whereon our time must treate. Thr. Heer's Beard your Butler: a rescue Beard; draw, Bea. Draw? not so: my Blad's as ominously drawne Vnto the death of nine or ten such groomes, As is a knife vnsheath'd with the hungry maw, Threatning the ruine of a chine of Beefe: But for the restlesse toile it tooke of late, My blade shall sleep awhile. Th. Helpe. Be. Stop thee Throate And heare me speake, whose bloody Characters, Will shew I haue beene scuffling: briefly thus, Thy wife, your daughter, and your louely Neece, Is hurri'd now to Fleet-streete, the damn'd crew With glaues and clubs haue rapt her from these armes, Throate thou art bobd, although thou boughtst the heyre, Yet hath the slaue made a re-entry. I. Tu. Sirra what are you? Th. My Ladies Butler sir. Bea. Not I by heauen. Thr. By this good light he swore it, And for your daughters loue he ran away. Bea. By Ioue I guld thee Throte. I. T. More knauery yet, Lay hands on him, pinion them both, And guarde them hence towards Fleet-streete, come away, Bea. Must we be led like theeues, and pinniond walke, Spent I my bloud for this? is this my hyre? Why then burne rage, set Beard and nose on fire. I. T. On, on I say. Thr. Justice, the law shall firke you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quinti. ScÃ¦na 1. Enter William Small-shanke. W. S. On this one houre depends my hopes and fortunes, Foote I must haue this widdow: what should my Dad Make with a wife, that scarce can wipe his nose, Vntrusse his points, or hold a Chamber-pot, Steddy till a pisses: The doores are fast, 'Tis now the midst of night; yet shall this chaine, Procure accesse and conference with the widdow: What though I cheate my father, all men haue sinnes, Though in their seuerall kinds, all ends in this, So they get gold, they care not whose it is. Begging the Court, vse beares the Cittie out, Lawyers their quirkes, thus goes the world about, So that our villanies haue but different shapes, Th'effects all one, and poore men are but Apes, To imitate their betters, this is the difference, All great mens sinnes must still be humored, And poore mens vices largely punished, The priuiledge that great men haue in euill, Is this, they go vnpunisht to the Diuell Therefore Ile in, this chaine I know will mooue, Gold and rich stones, wins coyest ladies loue. Knocks. Adr. What would you sir, that you do knock so boldly. W. S. I must come in to the widdow. Adr. How come in, The widdow has no entrance for such mates. W. S. Doost heere sweet Chamber-maid, by heauen I come, With letters from my father, I haue brought her stones, Iewels and chaines, which she must vse to morrow. Adr. Y'are a needy knaue, and will lye: Your father has casheerd you, nor will a trust you, Begon, least I doe wash you hence. W. S. Doost heere, By this good night, my Father and I are friends, Take but this cheine for token, giue her that, And tell her I haue other things for her, Which by my fathers will I am commanded To giue to her owne hands. Adr. Say you so, Introth I thinke youle prooue an honest man, Had you once got a beard; let me see the cheine, W. S, Doost thinke I lye? by this good light Adrian I loue her with my soule, heer's letters And other Iewels sent her from my father, Is shee a bed. Adr. By my virginity, Shee is vncast, and ready to flip in, Betwixt the sheetes, but I will beare hir this, And tell her what you say. W. S. But make some hast, Why so 'twill take, zart how a waiting maide, Can shake a fellow vp that is casheerd, And has no money: foote should she keepe the chaine, And not come downe, I must turne Cittizen, Be banckrout, and craue the Kings protection But heere she comes. Taf. What would you sir with vs, That on the suddaine, and so late you come. W. S. I haue some secrets to acquaint you with, Please you to let the chamber maide shake off, And stand as Centinel. Taf. It shall not need, I hope I haue not brought her vp so ill, But that she knowes how to containe your secrets, As well as I her Mistresse: Therefore on. W. S. It is not fit forsooth that I should on, Before she leaue the roome. Adr. Tis not indeed. Therefore Ile waite in the with-drawing roome Vntill you call. Taf. Now sir, what's your will? W. S, Deere widdow, pitty the state of a young, Poore, yet propper Gentleman, by Venus pap Vpon my knees I'de creepe vnto your lap For one small drop of fauour, and though this face Is not the finest face, yet t'as beene praisd By Ladies of good iudgment in faces. Taf. Are these your secrets? W. S. You shall haue secrets More pleasing, nay heere sweet widdow, Some wantons doe delight to see men creepe, And on their knees to woe them. Taf. I am none of those, Stand vp, I more desire a man should stand, Then cringe and creepe that meanes to winne my loue, I say stand vp, and let me goe ye'ad best. W. S. For euer let me creepe vpon the ground, Vnlesse you heere my sute. Taf. How now sir sawce, Would you be capring in your fathers saddle, Away you casheerd yonger brother, begon. Doe not I know the fashions of you all, When a poore woman has laide open all Her thoughts to you, then you grow proud and coy, But when wise maides dissemble and keepe close, Then you poore snakes come creeping on your bellyes, And with all oyled lookes prostrate your selues, Before our beauties sunne, where once but warme, Like hatefull snakes you strike vs with your stings, And then forsake vs, I know your tricks begon. W. S. Foote Ile first be hang'd, nay if you go You shall leaue your smock behinde you widdow, Keepe close your womanish weapon, hold your tongue, Nor speake, cough, sneeze or stampe, for if you doe, By this good blade Ile cut your throte directly, Peace, stirre not, by Heauen Ile cut your throate If you but stirre: speake not, stand still, go to, Ile teach coy widdowes a new way to woe, Come you shall kisse, why so, Ile stab by Heauen If you but stirre, now heere, first kisse againe, Why so, stirre not, Now come I to the point, My hopes are past, nor can my present state, Affoord a single halfe-penny, my father Hates me deadly; to beg, my birth forbids, To steale, the law, the hang man, and the Rope With one consent deny; to go a trust, The Citty common-councell has forbad it, Therefore my state is desperate, stirre not, And I by much will rather choose to hang, Then in a ditch or prison-hole to starue, Resolue, wed me, and take mee to your bed, Or by my soule Ile straite cut off your head, Then kill my selfe, for I had rather dye, Then in a street liue poore and lowsily: Doe not I know you cannot loue my father. A widdow that has knowne the quid of things, To doate vpon an old and crased man, That stinkes at both ends, worsse then an elder pype, Who when his bloud and spirit are at the height, Hath not a member to his palsie body, But is more limber then a Kings head pudding, Tooke from the pot halfe sod doe I not know this? Haue you not wealth enough, to serue vs both? And am not I a pritty handsome fellow, To doe your drudgery, come, come, resolue. For by my bloud, if you deny your bed, Ile cut your throat, without equiuocation, If you be pleased hold vp your finger, if not By heauen Ile gar my whyniard through your weombe, Ist a match. Taf. Here me but speake. W. S. Youle prate to loud. Ta. No. W. S. Nor speake one word against my honest sute. Ta. No by my worth W. S. Kisse vpon that and speake, Ta. I dare not wed, men say yare naught youle cheate. And you do keepe a whore. W. S. That is a lie, She keepes her selfe and me, yet I protest, Shees not dishonest. Ta. How could she then maintaine you, W. S. Why by her commings in, a little thing, Her friends haue left her which with putting to best vse. And often turning yeelds her a poore liuing, But what of that; shes now shooke off, to thee Ile onely cleaue, Ile be thy marchant. And to this welthy fayre, Ile bring my ware, And here set vp my standing: therefore resolue, Nought but my sword is left ift be a match, Clap hands, contract and straite to bed, If not, pray, forgiue and straight goes off your head. Ta. I take thy loue. W. S. Then straite lets both to bed. Ta. Ile wed to morrow. W. S. You shall not sleepe vpont. An honest contract is as good as marriadge. A bird in hand you know the prouerbe widdow, Ta. To let me tell thee, Ile loue thee while I liue, For this attempt giue me that lusty lad, That winnes his widdow with his well drawne blade, And not with oaths and words: a widdows woing, Not in bare words but should consist in doing, I take thee to my husband. W. S. I thee to wife, Now to thy bed and there weele end this strife. Enter Sir Oliuer and Fidlers. S. O. Warme bloud the yong mans slaue, the ould mans God Makes me so stirre thus soone, it stirs ifayth, And with a kind of Itching pricks me on, To bid my bride boun Iour, O this desire, Is euen another filtcht promethian fire, By which we old men liue, performance then, I thats poore old mens baine, that in old men, Comes limping off more lame God knowes then he, Which in a close, a hot and dangerous fight, Has bin dismembred and craues by letter patents, Yet scarce a woman that considers this, Women haue tricks firks and farthinggales, A generation are they full of subtilty, And all most honest where they want the meanes. To be otherwise. Therefore Ile haue an eie My widdow goes not oft to visit kinsfolkes, By birth she is a Ninny, and that I know, Is not in London held the smalest kindred, I must haue wits and braines, come on my friends, Out with your tooles, and toot, a strane of mirth. And a pleasant song to wake the widdow. Enter W. S. aboue in his shirt. W. S. Musitions, mnistrills, foote rogues, For Gods loue leaue your filthy squeaking noyse And get you gone, the widdow and my selfe, Will scamble out the shaking of the sheets, Without your musicke, we haue no need of fidlers, To our dauncing, foote haue you no manners, Cannot a man take his naturall rest. For your scraping, I shall wash your gut-strings. If you but stay a while; yet honest rascalls, If youle let vs haue the tother crash The widdow and Ile keepe time, theres for your paines, S. O. Hows this? will the widdow and you keepe time, What trycke? what quiddit? what figare is this? My casheerd Sonne speake from the widdowes chamber, And in his shirt ha, sure she is not there, Tis so she has tooke him in for pitty, And now remoues her chamber I will home, On with my neatestrobes, perfume my beard, Eate cloues, Eringoes and drinke some aquauita. To sweeten breath and keepe my weame from wambling. Then like the moneth of March, come blustring in, Marry the widdow shake vp this spring all, And then as quiet as a sucking lambe, Close by the widdow will I rest al night, As for my breath I haue crotchets and deuises, Ladies ranke breaths are often healpt with spices. Enter Adriana, and another strawing hearbs. Adr. Come straw a pace, Lord shall I neuer liue, To walke to Church on flowers. O tis fine, To see a bride tryp it to Church so lightly, As if her new choppines would scorne to bruze A silly flower: and now I prethee tell me, What flower thinkest thou is likest to a woman? Vi. A marigold I thinke. Adr. Why a marygold: Vi. Because a little heate makes it to spred, And open wide his leaues. Adr. Thart quite wide, A marigold doth open wide all day, And shuts most close at night; I hope thou knowst, All wenches doe the contrary: but sirra, How does thy Vncle the old Doctor, Dost thinke heele be a Bishop? Vi. O questionlesse, For has got him a young wife, and carried her, To Court already: but now I prethee say, Why will the widdow wedd so old a knight, Adr. Why for his riches. Ui. For riches onely, Why riches cannot giue her her delight, Adr. Ritches I hope can soone procure her one Shall giue her her delight thats the Diuell, Thats it ifaith makes vs waiting gentlewomen Liue maides so long. Vi. Thinke you so. Adr. Yes infaith, Married women quite haue spoyled the market, By hauing secret friends besides their husbands, For if these married wiues would be content To haue but one a peece I thinke in troth, There would be doings enough for vs all, And till we get an act of parliament, For that our states are desperate. Enter Boucher and Constan. Come straw a peece. Con. So ho ho, Maister. Bou. Boy, Con. Introth I thought y'ad beene more fast asleepe, Then a midwife or a Puritane Taylor, At a sonday euenings Lecture, but sir Why do you rise so soone? Bou. To see the widdow, Con. The weaker you, you are forbid a widdow, And 'tis the first thing you will fall into. Me thinkes a young cleere skind country Gentlewoman, That neuer saw Babounes, Lyons, or Courtiers, Might prooue a handsome wife, or what do you say To a Cittizens daughter, that neuer was in loue With a Player, that neuer learnt to daunce, That neuer dwelt neere any Inne a Court, Might not she in time prooue an honest wife? Faith take a maide, and leaue the widdow, Maister Of all meates I loue not a gaping Oyster, Bou, God speed your workes faire maides. Ad. You much mistake, Tis no worke. Bou. What then. Adr. A preparation To a worke sir. Bou. What worke sweet Ladies? Adr. Why to a mariage? thats a worke I thinke, Bou. How? a preparation to a mariage, Of whom kind maids, of whom? Adr. And why kind maids? I hope you haue had no kindnesse at our hand, To make you say so: but sir vnderstand, That Sir Oliuer Smal-shanke the noble Knight, And mistresse Tafata the rich widdow, Must this day be coupled, conioyned, Married, espoused, wedded, contracted, Or as the Puritaine sayes, put together, And so sir, to the shifting of our cleane smocks, Wee leaue you. Bou. Married, and to day, Dissention, Iealousie, hate, beggery, With all the dire euents which breed dislike In nuptiall beds, attend her bridall steps, Can vowes and oathes, with such protesting action, As if their hearts were spit forth with their words, As if their soules were darted through their eyes, Be of no more validity with women? Haue I for her contem'd my fixed fate. Neglected my faire hopes, and scorn'd the loue Of beautious, vertuous, and honor'd Constantia. Con. Now workes it with my wish: my hopes are full. Bou. And I ingag'd my worth and ventur'd life On yonder buffolne face, to haue men scorne, And poynt at my disgrace: first will I leaue to liue: There take my purse, liue thou to better fate. Bouch. hangs himselfe. Better thus die, then liue vnfortunate. Con. Aye mee accurst: helpe, helpe, murther murther, Curst be the day and houre that gaue me breath, Murther, murther: if any Gentleman Can heare my plaints, come forth and assist me. W. S. What out-cryes call me from my naked bed, Who calls Ieronimo, speake here I am. Con. Good sir leaue your struggling and acting, And helpe to saue the life of a distressed man, O helpe if you be Gentlemen! W. S. Whats here? A man hangd vp and all the murtherers gone? And at my doore to lay the guilt on me. This place was made to pleasure Cittizens wiues, Enter Tafata. And not to hange vppe honest Gentlemen Taf. Where be these lazie knaues? some raise the house, What ment the cry of murther? where's my loue? W. S. Come Isabella, helpe me to lament, For sigthes are stopt, and all my teares are spent. These clothes I oft haue seene, aye me my friend: Pursue the murtherers, rayse all the street Con. It shall not need, a stirs, giue him breath. W. S. Is there yet life, Horatio my deere boy, Horatio! Horatio, what hast thou mis-done, To lose thy life when life was new begunne? Bou. Zeart a man had as good be hangd outright, As to indure this clapping: shame to thy sexe, Perfidious periur'd woman, wher's thy shame? How can thy modesty forbeare to blush, And knowst I know thee an adultresse? Haue not thy vowes made thee my lawfull wife Before the face of heauen? where is thy shame? But why speake I of shame to thee, whose face, Is steel'd with custom'd sinne, whose thoughts want grace: The custome of thy sinne so luls thy sence: Women nere blush, though nere so foule th'offence, To breake thy vow to me and straight to wed, A doting stinckerd. W. Sm. But hold your tongue, Or by this light Ile trusse you vp againe, Zeart rayle on my wife, am I a stinkerd, Or do I dote? speake such another word, And vp you trusse againe, am I a stinkerd? Bou, The knight your father is: W. S. VVhy who denies it. He supplants thee and I supplanted him. Come come, you shall be friends come forgiue her: For by this light there is no remedy, Vnlesse you will betake you to my leauings. Con, Rather then so Ile helpe you to a wife: Ritch, well borne, and by some accounted fayre, And for the worth of her Virginity, I dare presume to pawne my honesty: VVhat say you to Constantia Somerfield? W. S. Do'st know where she is boy? Con. I do, nay more, If he but sweare to imbrace her constant loue, Ile fetch her to this place. W. S. A shall do it boy, Enter Sir Oliuer and Fiddlers. A shall do it, goe fetch her boy, foote my father, Stand too't now old wench, stand too't now. S. Ol. Now fresh and youthfull as the month of May, Ile bid my Bryde good morrow, Musitions on, Lightly, lightly, and by my knighthoods spurre, This yeere you shall haue my protection, And yet not buy your liuery coates your selues: God morrow Bride, fresh, fresh, as the month of May, I come to kisse thee on thy wedding day. W. S. Sauing your tale sir, Ile shew you how, Aprill showers spring May flowers, So merrily singes the Cucko: The truth is, I haue laide my knife abord, The widdow sir is wedded. S. Ol. Ha, W. S. Bedded. S. Ol. ha: W. S. Why my good father what should you do with a wife? Would you be crested? will you needs thrust your head In on of Vulcans Helmets? will you perforce Weare a Citty cappe and a Court feather? S. Ol. Villaine, slaue, thou hast wrong'd my wife. VV. S. not so, Speake my good wench, haue I not done thee right. Taf. I finde no fault, and I protest Sir Oliuer. I'd not haue lost the last two houres sleepe, I had by him, for all the wealth you haue. S. Ol. Villaine slaue, Ile hang thee by the statute, Thou hast two wiues. W. S. Be not so furious sir, I haue but this, the other was my whore, Which now is married to an honest Lawyer. S. Ol. Thou villaine slaue rhou hast abus'd thy father. Bou. Your sonne ifaith, your very sonne ifaith, The villaine boy has one trick of his sire, Has firkt away the wench, has pierst the hogshead, And knowes by this the vintadge. S. Ol. I am vndone. Bou. You could not loue the widdow but her wealth. S. Ol. The deuill take my soule but I did loue her. Taf, That oath doth shew you are a Northen Knight, And of all men aliue, Ile neuer trust, A Northen man in loue. S. Ol. And why? and why slut. Taf. Because the first word he speakes is the Diuell Take his soule, and who will giue him trust, That once has giuen his soule vnto the Diuell. W. S. Shee sayes most true father, the soule once gon, The best part of a man is gone. Taf. And ifaith If the best part of a man be once gone, The rest of the body is not worth a rush, Though it be nere so handsome. Enter La, Somerfield, Throte &amp; Beard bound, &amp; Iu. Tutch. La. S. Bring them away. W. S. How now? My Lawyer pinion'd I begin to stinke Already. La. S. Cheater my daughter. W. S. Shee's mad. Thr. My wife sir, my wife. W. S. They're mad, starke mad, I am sorry sir you haue lost those happy wits By which you liu'd so well. The ayre growes cold, Therefore Ile take my leaue. La. So. Stay him officers, Sir 'tis not your trickes of wit can carry it. Officers attache him, and this Gentleman, For stealing away my heire. W. S. You do me wrong, Zart I neuer saw your heire. Thr. That's a lye, You stole her, and by chance I married her. W. S. God giue you ioy sir. Thr. Aske the Butler else, Therefore widdow release me, for by no law, Statute or booke case, of Uicesimo Edwardi Secundi, nor by the Statute Of Tricesimo Henrici sexti, Nor by any booke case of decimo Of the late Queene, am I accessarie, Part, or party confederate, abetter, Helper, seconder, perswader, forwarder, Principall or maintainer of this late theft: But by law, I forward, and shee willing, Clapt vp the match, and by a good Statute Of Decimo tertio Richardi quarti, She is my leefull lawfull, and my true Married wife, teste Liftenant Beard. W. S. Who liues would thinke that you could prate so fast, Your hands being bound behind you, foote a talkes With as much ease as if a were in's shirt. S. Ol. I am witnesse thou hadst the heire. I. Tu. So am I. Thr. And so is my man Dash. Bou. Heere me but speake, Sit you as Iudges, vndoe the Lawyers hands, That a may freely act, and Ile be bound That William Smalshanke shall put your Throte to silence, And ouer-throw him at his owne weapon. I. Tu. Agreed, take each his place, and heere the case Argued betwixt them two. Om. Agreed, agreed. I. Tu. Now Throte or neuer, stretch your selfe. Thr. Feare not W. S. Heere stand I for my client, this Gentleman. Thr. I for the widdow. W. S. Begin. Thr. Right worshipfull I say that William Small-shanke mad-man, Is by a Statute made in Octauo Of Richard Cordelion guilty to the law Of fellony, for stealing this Ladies heire, That a stole her, the proofe is most pregnant, He brought her to my house, confest himselfe, A made great meanes to steale her, I likt her, (And finding him a nouice) truth to tell, Married her my selfe, and as I said, By a Statute Richardi Quarti, Shee is my lawfull wife. W. S. For my client, I say the wench brought vnto your house, Was not the daughter to rich Somerfield. S. Ol. What proofe of that W. S. This gentleman. Th. Tut tut Hee is a party in the cause, but sir, If 'twere not the daughter to this good widdow, Who was it? answer that. W. S. An arrant whore Which you haue married, and she is runne Away with all your Iewels, this is true: And this Lieutenant Beard can testifie, Twas the wench I kept in Hofier-lane. Bea. What was it shee? W. S. The very same. I. Tu. Speake sirra Beard, if all he sayes be true, Bea. Shee said, she was a Punke, a Rampant whore, Which in her time had beene the cause of parting Some foureteene bawdes; he kept her in the Suburbs, Yet I do thinke this wench was not the same. Bou. The case is cleere with me. Om. O strange. Th. Sir, sir, This is not true, how liu'd you in the Suburbs, And scapt so many searches? W. S. I answer, That most Constables in out-parishes Are bawdes themselues; by which we scapt the searches. S. Ol. This is most strange. La. S. What's become of this woman? Bea. That know not I. As I was squiring her A long the streete, Maister Small-shanke set vpon me, Beate me downe, and tooke away the maide, Which I suppose was daughter to the widdow. W. S. A lyes, let me be hangd if a lye not. S. Ol. What confusion is this. Con. Bring them forward, God preserue your worship. And it like you Maddam, We were commanded by our deputy, That if we tooke a woman in the watch, To bring her straight to you. And heering there You were come hether, hether we brought them. S. Ol. The one is my sonne, I doe acknowledge him, What woman's that. T. S. The widdowes daughter sir, W. S. Bloud is he guld to. T. S. My brother stole her first, Throte coozend him, and I had coozned Throte, Had not the Constable tooke vs in the watch, Shee is the widdowes daughter, had I had luck, Thr. And my espoused wife. La. S. Vnmaske her face, My daughter I defie her. W. S. Your worships wife, Thr. I am guld and abus'd, and by a Statute Of Triceffimo of the late Queene, I will Star-chamber you all for coosonage, And be by law diuorst. W. S. Sir twill not hold, Shee's your leefull, lawfull, and true wedded wife, Teste Lieftenant Beard. Bea. Wast you that brake my head? W. S. But why shouldst thinke much to dye a Cuckold, Being borne a Knaue? as good Lawyers as you Scorne not hornes. Thr. I am guld, aye me accurst! Why should the harmlesse man be vext with hornes, When women most deserue them? W. S. Ile shew you sir, The husband is the wiues head, and I pray Where should the hornes stand but vpon the head: Why wert not thou begot (thou foolish knaue) By a poore Sumner, on a Sergiants widdow? Wert not thou a Puritane, and put in trust To gather releefe for the distressed Geneua, And didst not thou leaue thy poore bretheren, And runne away with all the money, speake, Was not that thy first rising? go, Y'are well coupled by Ioue yee are, she is But a yonger sister newly come to towne, Shee's currant mettle, not a penny the worse For a little vse, whole within the Ring, By my soule. Bea. Will a take her thinkst thou? Bou. Yes faith, vpon her promise of amendment. I. Tut. The Lawyer is gold. Thr. Am I thus ouer-reach'd, to haue a wife, And not of the best neither? Fra. Good sir be content, A Lawyer should make all things right and straight, All lyes but in the handling, I may prooue A wife that shall deserue your best of loue. S. Ol. Take her Throte, you haue a better iewell now Then euer, kisse her, kisse her man, all friends. La. S: Yet in this happy close, I still haue lost My onely daughter. W. S. Wher's thy Page Boutcher? Con. Here I present the Page: and that all doubts, May heere be cleerd, heere in my propper shape, That all your ioyes may bee compleat and full, I must make one, with pardon gentle mother, Since all our friends so happily are met, Here will I choose a husband: this be the man, Whom since I left your house in shape of Page, I still haue followed. W. S. Foot would I had knowne so much, I would haue beene bold to haue laine with your page. Con. Say am I welcome. Bou. As is my life and soule, La. S. Heauen giue you ioy, Since all so well succeeds, take my consent, W. S. Then are we all pair'd, I and my lasse, You and your wife, the lawyer and his wench, And father fall you aborde of the widdow, But then my brother. T. S. Faith I am a foole. W. S. Thats all one; If God had not made Some elder-brothers fooles, how should witty Yonger brothers be maintain'd, Strike vp Musick, lets haue an old song, Since all my tricks haue found so good successe, Weele sing, dance, dice, and drinke downe heauinesse.

      <field name="fulltext">Epilogus. Thus two houres haue brought to end, What many tedious houres haue pend, A dares not glory nor distrust, But he (as other writers must) Submits the censures of his paines To those whose wit and nimble braines, Are able best to iudge: and as for some, Who fild with malice, hether come To belch their poyson on his labour, Of them he doth intreate no fauour, But bids them hang, or soone amend, For worth shall still it selfe defend, And for our selues wee doe desire, Youle breath on vs that growing fire, By which in time wee may attaine, Like fauours which some others gaine: For bee assur'd our loues shall tend, To equall theirs, if not transcend.
