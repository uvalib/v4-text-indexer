      <field name="fulltext">THE NOBLE GENTLEMAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus ScÃ¦na Prima. Enter Gentleman and Jaques. Gent. What happiness waits on the life at Court, What dear content, greatness, delight &amp; ease? What ever-springing hopes, what tides of honour, That raise their fortunes to the height of wishes? What can be more in man, what more in nature, Then to be great and fear'd? A Courtier, A noble Courtier, 'Tis a name that drawes Wonder, and dutie, from all eyes and knees. Jaq. And so your Worships land within the walls, Where you shall have it all inclos'd and sure. Gent. Peace knave; dull creature, bred of sweate and smoke, These mysteries are far above thy faith: But thou shalt seeâ Jaq. And then I shall believe; Your faire revenues; turn'd into faire suites, I shall believe your Tenants bruis'd and rent Under the weight of Coaches, all your state Drawn through the streets in triumph, suits for places Plied with a mine of gold, and being got Fed with a great streame, I shall believe all this. Gent. You shall believe, and know me glorious. Cozin good day and health. Enter Cozen. Couzen. The same to you Sir, And more, without my wishes, could you know What calm content dwels in a private house: Yet looke into your selfe, retire: this place Of promises, and protestations, fits Minds only bent to ruine, you should know this, You have their language perfect, you have tutors I doe not doubt sufficient: but beware. Gent. You are merry Couzin: Cozen. Yet your patience, You shall learn that too, but not like it selfe Where it is held a vertue; tell me Sir, Have you cast up your state, rated your land, And finde it able to endure the change Of time and fashion? is it alwayes harvest? Alwayes vintage? have you ships at Sea To bring you gold, and stone from rich Peru Monthly returning treasure? doth the King Open his large Exchequer to your hands And bid you be a great man? can your wife Coyne off her beauty? or the weeke allow Suites to each day? and know no ebb in honour? If these be possible, and can hold out, Then be a Courtier still, and still be wasting, Gen. Cozen, pray give me leave: Cous. I have done. Gen. I could requite your gall, and in a straine As bitter, and as full of Rubard, preacht Against your Countrey life, but 'tis below me And only subject to my pitty, know The eminent court, to them that can be wise, And fasten on her blessings, is a sunne That drawes men up from course and earthly being, I meane these men of merit that have power And reason to make good her benefits, Learns them a manly boldnesse, gives their tongues Sweetnesse of language, makes them apt to please; Files of all rudenesse, and uncivill haviour, Shews them as neat in carriage as in cloaths; Cozen have you ever seen the Court? Cous. No Sir, Nor am I yet in travaile with that longing. Gent. O the state, and greatnesse of that place Where men are found Only to give the first creation glory! Those are the models of the ancient world Left like the Roman statues to stir up Our following hopes, the place it selfe puts on The brow of Majestie, and flings her lustre Like the aire newly lightned, forme, and order, Are only there themselues, unforc't, and sound, As they were first created to this place. Cous. You nobly came, but wil goe from thence base. Gent. 'Twas very pretty, and a good conceite; You have a wit good Cozen, I do joy in't, Keep it for Court: but to my selfe againe, When I have view'd these pieces, turn'd these eyes, And with some taste of superstition, Lookt on the wealth of Nature, the faire dames, Beauties, that lights the Court, and makes it shew Like a faire heaven, in a frosty night: And mongst these mine, not poorest, 'tis for tongues Of blessed Poets, such as Orpheus was, To give their worth and praises; O deare Cozen: You have a wife, and faire, bring her hither, Let her not live to be the Mistris of a Farmers heir And be confined ever to a serge, Farre courser then my horse-cloath. Let her have Velvets, Tiffinies, Jewels, Pearls, A Coach, an Usher, and her two Lacquies, And I will send my Wife to give her rules, And reade the rudiments of Court to her. Cous. Sir I had rather send her to Virginia To help to propagate the English nation. Enter Servant. Gen. Sirra, how slept your Mistris, and what visitants Are to pay service? Ser. Sir as I came out, Two Counts were newly entered. Gent. This is greatnesse, But few such servants waite a Countrey beauty. Cous. They are the more to thank their modesty, God keep my wife, and all my Issue female From such uprisings. Enter a Doctor. Gent. What? my learned Doctor? You will be welcome, give her health and youth And I will give you gold. Exit Doctor. Cozen, how savours this? is it not sweet? And very great, tasts it not of Noblenesse? Cous. Faith Sir my pallat is too dull and lazie I cannot taste it, 'tis not for my relish, But be so still. Since your own misery must first reclaime ye, To which I leave you Sir, If you will yet be happy, leave the humour And base subjection to your Wife, be wise, And let her know with speed you are her husband, I shall be glad to heare it. My horse is sent for. Exit. Gent. Even such another countrey thing as this Was I, such a piece of durt, so heavy, So provident to heap up ignorance, And be an asse: such musty cloaths wore I, So old and threed-bare: I do yet remember Divers young Gallants lighting at my gate, To see my honoured wife, have offered pence, And bid me walk their horses, such a slave Was I in shew then: but my eyes are open'd. Enter Gent. Wife. Many sweet morrows to my worthy Wife. Wife. 'Tis well, and aptly given, as much for you, But to my present businesse, which is moneyâ Gent. Lady I have none left. Wife. I hope you dare not say so, nor imagin so base and lowe, A thought: I have none left. Are these words fitting for a man of worth, And one of your full credite? Do you know The place you live in? me, and what I labour For, you? and your advancement? Gent. Yes my dearest. Wife. And do you pop me off with this slight answer, In troth I have none left? in troth you must have; Nay stare not, 'tis most true, send speedily To all that love you, let your people flye Like thunder through the Citie, And not return under five thousand crownes. Try all, take all, let not a wealthy merchant be untempted Or any that hath the name of money, Take up at any use, give band, or land, Or mighty statutes able by their strength To tye up Sampson were he now alive, There must be money gotten; for be perswaded, If we fall now, or be but seen to shrinke, Under our faire beginnings, 'tis our ruine, And then good-night to all, (but our disgrace) Farewell the hope of comming happinesse, And all the aimes we levied at so long. Are ye not mov'd at this? no sense of want, Towards your selfe yet breeding? be old, And common; jaded to the eyes Of groomes, and pages, chamber-maides, and garders, And when you have done, put your poor house in order And hang your selfe, for such must be the end Of him that willingly forsakes his hopes And hath a joy to tumble to his ruine. All that I say is certaine, if ye faile Do not impute me with it, I am cleare. Gent. Now heaven forbid I should do wrong to you My dearest Wife, and Madam; yet give leave To your poore creature to unfold himselfe. You know my debts are many more then meanes, My bands not taken in, my friends at home Drawn dry with these expences, my poore Tenants More full of want then we, then what new course Can I beget to raise those crowns by? speake, And I shall execute. Wife. Pray tell me true, Have you not land in the Countrey? Gent. Pardon me, I had forgot it. Wife. Sir, you must remember it, There is no remedy, this land must be In Paris ere to morrow night. Gent. It shall, let me consider, some 300. acres Will serve the turne. Wife. 'Twill furnish at all points, Now you speak like your selfe, and know like him, That meanes to be man, suspect no lesse For the return will give ye five for one, You shall be great to morrow, I have said it. Farewell, and see this businesse be a-foote With expedition. Exit Wife. Gent. Health, all joy, and honour Waite on my lovely wife. What? Jaques, Iaques. Enter Jaques. Ja. Sir did you call? Gent. I did so, hie the Iaques. Downe to the Bancke, and there to some good Merchant (Conceive me well good Iaques, and be private) Offer 300. acres of my land: Say it is choise, and fertile, aske upon it Five thousand Crowns, this is the businesse I must employ thee in, be wise and speedy. Ja. Sir do not do this. Gent. Knave I must have money. Ia. If you have money thus, your knave must tell ye You will not have a foote of land left, be more warie And more friend to your selfe, this honest land Your Worship has discarded, has been true, And done you loyall service. Gent. Gentle Iaques, You have a merry wit, employ it well About the businesse you have now in hand. When ye come backe, enquire me in the presence, If not, in the Tennis-Court, or at my house. Exit. Ia. If this vaine hold, I know where to enquire ye. Five thousand crowns, this with good husbandry May hold a month out, then 5000. more, And more land a bleeding for't, as many more And more land laid aside. God and St. Dennis Keep honest minded young men Bachellers. 'Tis strange My Mr. should be yet so young A puppy, that he cannot see his fall And got so neare the sun. I'le to his Cozen And once more tell him on't, if he faile, Then to my mortgage, next unto my sale. Exit. Enter Longovile, Bewford, and the Servant. Serv. Gentlemen, hold on discourse a while, I shall return with knowledge how, and where We shall have best accesse unto my Mistris To Tender your devotions. Exit Long. Be it so: Now to our first discourse. Bew. I prethee peace; Thou canst not be so bad, or make me know Such things are living, doe not give thy selfe So common and so idle, so open vile, So great a wronger of thy worth, so low, I cannot, nor I must not credite thee. Lon. Now by this light I am a Whore-master, An open and an excellent Whore-master, And take a speciall glory that I am so: I thank my stars I am a Whore-master, And such a one as dare be known and seen, And pointed at to be a noble wencher. Bew. Do not let all eares heare this, harke ye Sir, I am my selfe a Whore-master, I am Believe it Sir (In private be it spoken) I love a VVhore directly, most men are Wenchers, And have profest the science, few men That looks upon ye now, but Whore-masters, Or have a full desire to be so. Lon. This is noble. Bew. It is without all question, being private, And held as needfull as intelligence, But being once discover'd, blown abroad, And known to common senses, 'tis no more Then geometrical rules in Carpenters That only know some measure of an art, But are not grounded: be no more deceived, I have a conscience to reclaim you, Sir. Mistake me not: I do not bid you leave your whore Or lesse to love her; forbid it I should be such a villain to my friend, Or so unnaturall: 'twas never harbor'd here, Learn to be secret first, then strike your Deere. Long. Your faire instructions Monsieur I shall learn. Bew. And you shall have them: I desire your care. Long. They are your servants. Bew. You must not love. Long. How Sir? Bew. I meane a Lady, theres danger Shee hath an Usher and a Waiting-Gentlewoman, A page, a Coach-man, these are feed, and fee'd And yet for all that will be prating. Long. So. Bew. You understand me Sir, they will discover't, And there is a losse of credite: table talke Will be the end of this, or worse, then that; Will this be worthy of a Gentleman? Long. Proceed good Sir. Bew. Next leave your City Dame; The best of that tribe are most meerly coy, Or most extreamely foolish, both which vices Are no great stirrers up, unlesse in husbands That owe this Cattle, fearing her thats coy To be but seeming, her that's foole too forward. Long. This is the rarest fellow, and the soundest I meane in knowledge, that ere wore a Codpiece, H'as found out that will passe all Italy, All France and England, to their shames I speake And to the griefes of all their Gentlemen The noble theory of luxury. Bew. Your patience, And I will lay before your eyes a course That I my selfe found out, 'tis excellent, Easy, and full of freedome. Long. O good Sir, You rack me till I know it. Bew. This it is, When your desire is up, your blood well heated And apt for sweet encounter, chuse the night And with the night your wench the streets have store, There seize upon her, get her to your chamber, Give her a cardecew, 'tis royall payment When ye are dull, dismisse her, no man knows Nor she her selfe, who hath encountred her. Lon. O but their faces. Bew. Nere talke of faces: The night allows her equall with a Dutches, Imagination doth all think her faire, And great, clapt in velvet, she is so Sir, I have tryed those, and do find it certaine It never failes me, 'tis but twelve nights since My last experience. Lon. O my meiching varlet, I'le fit ye as I live. 'Tis excellent, I'le be your Scholler Sir. Enter Lady and Servant. Wife. You are fairly welcome both: troth Gentlemen You have been strangers, I could chide you for't, And taske ye with unkindness, what's the news? The towne was never empty of some novelty; Servant, what's your intelligence? Ser. Faith nothing. I have not heard of any worth relating Bew. Nor I sweet Lady. Lon. Then give me attention, Monsieur Shattillion's mad. Wife. Mad? Lon. Mad as May-butter, And which is more, mad for a wench. Lady. 'Tis strange, and full of pitty. Lon. All that comes neare him He thinks are come of purpose to betray him, Being full of strange conceite: the wench he loved Stood very near the Crowne. Lady. Alas good Monsieur; A' was a proper man, and faire demean'd, A person worthy of a better temper. Lon. He is strong opinion'd that the wench he loved Remaines close prisoner by the Kings command: Fearing her title, when the poore grieved Gentlewoman Follows him much lamenting, and much loving In hope to make him well, he knows her not, Nor any else that comes to visite him. Lady. Let's walk in Gentlemen, and there discourse His further miseries, you shall stay dinner, In truth you must obey. Om. We are your servants. Exeunt. Enter Couzen. Cous. Ther's no good to be done, no cure to be wrought Upon my desperate kinsman: I'le to horse And leave him to the fooles whip, misery. I shall recover twenty miles this night, My horse stands ready, I'le away with speed. Enter Shattillion. Shat. Sir, may I crave your name? Cous. Yes Sir you may: My name is Cleremon. Shat. 'Tis wel, your faction? What party knit you with? Cous. I know no parties, Nor no factions Sir. Shat. Then weare this crosse of white: And where you see the like they are my friends, Observe them well, the time is dangerous. Cous. Sir keep your crosse, I'le wear none, sure this fellow Is much beside himselfe, grown mad. Shat. A word Sir; You can pick nothing out of this, this crosse Is nothing but a crosse, a very crosse, Plaine without spell or witch-craft, search it, You may suspect, and well, there's poyson in't, Powder, or wild-fire, but 'tis nothing so. Cous. I do beleeve you Sir, 'tis a plain crosse. Shat. Then do your worst, I care not, tell the King, Let him know all this, as I am sure he shall; When you have spit your venome, then will I Stand up a faithfull, and a loyall subject, And so God save His Grace, this is no Treason. Cous. He is March mad, farewell Monsieur. Exit Couzen. Shat. Farewell; I shall be here attending, 'tis my life They aime at, there's no way to save it, well Let 'em spread all their nets: they shall not draw me Into any open Treason, I can see, And can beware, I have my wits about me, I thanke heaven for't. Enter Love. Love. There he goes, That was the fairest hope the French Court bred, The worthiest and the sweetest temper'd spirit, The truest, and the valiantest, the best of judgment, Till most unhappy I: sever'd those vertues And turn'd his wit wild with a coy deniall, Which heaven forgive me, and be pleas'd, O heaven To give againe his senses: that my love May strike off all my follies. Shat. Lady. Lov. I Sis Shat. Your will with me sweete Lady. Lov. Sir I come. Shat. From the dread souraigne King, I know it Lady, He is a gracious Prince, long may he live, Pertaine you to his chamber? Lov. No indeed Sir, That place is not for women, do you know me? Shat. Yes, I do know you. Lov. Whats my name? pray you speake. Shat. Thats all one, I do know you and your businesse, You are discovered Lady, I am warie, It stands upon my life; pray excuse me, The best man of this kingdome sent you hither, To dive into me, have I toucht you? ha? Lov. You are deceiv'd Sir, I come from your love, That sends you faire commends, and many kisses. Shat. Alas poore soule how does she? is she living? Keepes she her bed still? Lov. Still Sir, She is living, And well, and shall do so. Shat. Are ye in counsell? Lov. No Sir, nor any of my sex. Shat. Why so, If you had been in counsell, you would know, Her time to be but slender; she must die. Lov. I do believe it Sir. Shat. And suddainely, She stands too neare a fortune. Lov. Sir? Shat. 'Tis so, There is no jesting with a Princes title, Would we had both been borne of common parents And liv'd a private and retired life, In homely cottage, we had then enjoyed, Our loves, and our embraces, these are things, That cannot tend to treasonâ Lov. I am wretched. Shat. O I pray as often for the King as any, And with as true a hart, for's continuance, And do moreover pray his heires may live; And their faire issues, then as I am bound For all the states and commons, if these prayers Be any wayes ambitious, I submit, And lay my head downe let 'em take it off; You may informe against me, but withall Remember my obedience to the crowne, And service to the state. Lov. Good Sir, I love yee. Shat. Then love the gratious King, and say with me Lov. Heaven save his grace. Shat. This is strangeâ A woman should be sent to undermine me, And buz love into me to try my spirit; Offer me kisses and enticing follies, To make me open and betray my selfe; It was a subtle and a dangerous plot, And very soundly followed, farewell Lady, Let me have equall hearing, and relate I am an honest man. Heaven save the King. Exit. Love. I'le never leave him, till by art or prayer I have restorde his senses, If I make Him perfect man againe, he's mine still, when I here abjure all loves of other men. Exit. Enter Cozen, and Jaques. Jaques. Nay, good Sir be perswaded, go but back, And tell him hee's undone, say nothing else; And you shall see how things will worke upon't. Cozen. Not so good Jaques, I am held an asse A countrey foole, good to converse with durte And eate course bread, weare the worst wooll, Know nothing but the high way to Paris, And wouldst thou have me bring these staynes, And imperfections to the rising veiw Of the right worshipfull thy worthy Master? They must be bright and shine, their cloathes Soft velvet and the trojan purple Like the Arabian gums, hung like the Sun, Their golden beames on all sides; Such as these may come and know, Thy Master, I am base and dare not speake unto him, Hee's above me. Ja. If ever you did love him, or his state, His name, his issue, or your selfe, go backe: 'Twill be an honest and a noble part Worthy a kinsman, save 300 acres From present execution; they have had sentence, And cannot be repriev'd, be mercifull. Co. Have I not urg'd already all the reasons, I had to draw him from his will? his ruine? But all in vaine, no counsell will prevaile, Has fixt himselfe, ther's no removing Jaques, 'Twil prove but breath and labour spent in vaine, I'le to my horse, farewell. Ja. For Gods sake Sir, As ever you have hope of joy turne backe; I'le be your slave for ever, do but go, And I will lay such faire directions to you That if hee be not doting on his fall, He shall recover sight, and see his danger, And ye shall tell him of his wives abuses, I feare, to foule against him; how she plots, With our young Mounsiers, to milke dry her husband, And lay it on their backs, the next her pride, Then what his debts are, and how infinite The curses of his tenants, this will worke I'le pawne my life and head, he cryes away, I'le to my house in the Countrey. Co. Come I'le go, and once more try him, If he yeild not, so, The next that tryes him shall be want and woe. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus. Enter Gentleman Solus. Gent. Jaques. Jaq. Sir. within. Gent. Rise Jaques 'tis growne day, The country life is best, where quietly Free from the clamour of the troubled Court, We may enjoy our own greene shadowed walkes, And keepe a moderate diet without art. Why did I leave my house and bring my wife, To know the manner of this subtile place? I would when first the lust to fame an honour, Possest me, I had met with any evill. But that, had I been tyed to stay at home And earn the bread for the whole family With my own hand happy had I been. Enter Jaques. Ja. Sir this is from your wonted course at home, When did ye there keep such inordinate hours? Goe to bed late? start thrice? and call on me? Would you were from this place; our Countrey sleepes, Although they were but of that moderate length That might maintain us in our daily worke, Yet were they sound and sweet. Gent. I Jaques, there we dreamt not of our wives, wee lay together; And needed not; now at length my Cozins words, So truly ment, mixt with thy timely prayers So often urged, to keepe me at my home, Condemne me quite. Ja. 'Twas not your fathers course: He liv'd and dy'd in Orleance, where he had His Vines as fruitfull as experience (Which is the art of husbandry) could make; He had his presses for 'em, and his wines Were held the best, and out-sold other mens, His corne and cattell serv'd the neighbour Townes With plentifull provision, yet his thrift Could misse one beast amongst the heard, He rul'd more where he liv'd, then ever you will here. Gent. 'Tis true, why should my wife then 'gainst my good, Perswade me to continue in this course? Ja. Why did you bring her hither at the first, Before you warm'd her blood with new delights! Our countrey sports could have contented her, When you first married her; a puppet-play Pleas'd her as well as now the tilting doth. She thought her selfe brave in a bugle chaine, Where Orient pearle will scarce content her now. Gent. Sure Jaques, she sees something for my good More then I doe, she oft will talk to me Of offices, and that she shortly hopes By her acquaintance with the friends she hath To get a place shall many times outway Our great expences, and if this be soâ Ja. Think better of her words, she doth deceive you, And only for her vaine and sensuall ends Perswade ye thus. Let me be set to dwell For ever naked in the barest soile So you will dwell from hence. Gent. I see my folly, Packe up my stuffe, I will away this morne. Hasteâhaste. Ja. I, Now I see your Fathers honours Trebling upon you, and the many prayers The countrey spent for him, which almost now Begun to turn to curses, turning backe, And falling like a timely shower Upon ye. Gent. Goe, call up my wife. Ja. But shall she not prevaile, And sway you, as she oft hath done before? Gent. I will not heare her, but raile on her Till I be ten miles off. Ja. If you be forty, 'Twill not be worse Sir: Gent. Call her up, Ja. I will Sir. Exit. Gent. Why what an Asse was I that such a thing As a wife is could rule me? Know not I that woman was created for the man, That her desires, nay all her thoughts should be As his are? is my sense restor'd at length? Now she shall know, that which she should desire, She hath a husband that can govern her, Enter Wife. If her desires leades me against my will; Are you come? Wife. What sad unwonted course Makes you raise me so soone, that went to bed So late last-night. Gent. O you shall goe to bed sooner hereafter, And be rais'd againe at thriftie hours, In Summer-time wee'l walke, An houre after our supper, and to bed, In winter you shall have a set at Cards, And set your maids to worke. Wife. What do you meane? Gent. I wil no more of your new tricks, your honours, Your offices, and all your large preferments, Which still you beate into my eares, hang ore me. I'le leave behind for others, the great sway Which I shall beare at Court; my living here With countenance of your honoured friends I'le be content to loose: for you speake this Only that you may still continue here In wanton ease: and draw me to consume In cloaths and other things idle for shew That which my Father got with honest thrift. Wife. Why, who hath been with you Sir, That you talke thus out of Frame. Gent. You make a foole of me: You provide one to bid me forth to supper And make me promise; then must some one or other Invite you forth, if you have borne your selfe Loosely to any Gentleman in my sight At home, you ask me how I like the carriage, Whether it were not rarely for my good, And open'd not a way to my preferment? Come I perceive all: talke not, we'le away. Wife. Why Sir, you'le stay till the next triumph Day be past? Gent. I, you have kept me here triumphing This seven yeares, and I have ridden through the streetes, And bought embroyderd hose and foote-cloths too, To shew a subjects zeale, I rode before In this most gorgeous habit, and saluted All the acquaintance I could espie From any window, these were wayes ye told me To raise me; I see all: make you ready straight, And in that gowne which you came first to Town in, Your safe-guard, cloake, and your hood sutable: Thus on a duble gelding shall you amble, And my man Jaques shall be set before you. Wife. But will you goe? Gent. I will. Wife. And shall I too? Gen. And you shall too. Wife. But shall I by this light? Gen. Why by this light you shall. Wife. Then by this light You have no care of your estate, and mine. Have we been seven years venturing in a ship, And now upon return with a faire winde And a calme sea, full fraught with our own wishes Laden with wealth and honour to the brim, And shall we flye away and not receive it? Have we been tilling, sowing, labouring With paine and charge a long and tedious winter, And when we see the corne above the ground, Youthfull as is the morne and full eare That promises to stuffe our spatious garners, Shall we then let it rot, and never reap it? Gent. Wife talke no more, your Retoricke comes too late, I am inflixable: and how dere you Adventure to direct my course of life? Was not the husband mad to rule the wife? Wife. 'Tis true but where the man doth misse his way, It is the womans part to set him right; So Fathers have a power to guide their Sonnes In all their courses, yet you oft have seene Poore litle children that have both their eyes Lead their blind Fathers. Gen. She has a plaguy witt, I say you'r but a little piece of man. Wife. But such a peice, as being tane away Man cannot last: the fairest and tallest ship, That ever saild, is by a little peice of the same Wood, steerd right, and turnd about. Gen. 'Tis true she sayes, her answers stand with reason. Wife. But Sir, your Cozin put this in your head Who is an enemie to your preferment, Because I should not take place of his wife; Come by this kisse thou shalt not go sweete heart. Gen. Come, by this kisse I will goe Sweet-heart, On with your riding stuffe; I know your tricks, And if preferment fall ere you be ready, 'Tis welcome, else adue the Citie life. Wife. Well Sir I will obey. Gent. About it then, Wife. To please your humour I would dresse my selfe, In the most loathsome habit you could name Or travell any whether ore the world If you command me, it shall neere be said The fraylty of a woman whose weake minde, Is often set on loose delights and shewes, Hath drawne her husband to consume his state, In the vaine hope of that which never fell. Gen. About it then, women are pleasant creatures, When once a man begins to know himselfe. Wife. But harke you Sir because I wilbe sure, You shall have no excuse, no word to say In your defence hereafter; when you see What honours were preparde for you and me Which you thus willingly have throwne away, I tell you I did looke for present honour, This morning for you, which I know had come But if they do not come ere I am ready (Which I will be the sooner least they should) When I am once set in a countrey life, Not all the power of earth shall alter me, Not all your prayers or threats shall make me speak The Least words to my honourable freinds To do you any grace. Gent. I will not wish it. Wife. And never more hope to be honourable, Gent. My hopes are lower. Wife. As I live you shall not, You shall be so farr from the name of noble That you shall never see a Lord againe; You shall not see a maske, or Barriers, Or tilting or a solemn christning, Or a great marriage, or new fire-works, Or any bravery; but you shall live At home bespotted with your owne loved durt In scurvy cloathes as you were wont to doe, And to content you I will live so too. Gen. 'Tis all I wish, make hast the day drawes on, It shall be my care to see your stuffe pact up. Wife. It shall be my care to gul you: you shall stay. Ex. Gen. And more then so intreat me humbly too You shall have honours presently; Maria. Enter Maria. Mar. Madam. Wife. Bring hither, pen, inke, and paper. Ma. 'Tis here. Wife. Your Master Will not stay, Unlesse preferment come within an houre. Mar. Let him commande one of the Citie gates In time of mutiny, or you may provide him, To be one of the counsell for invading, Some savage countrey to plant christian faith. Wife. No, no, I have it for him, call my page Now my deare husband there it is will fit you. Exit. Maria And when the world shall see what I have done, Let it not move the spleene of any wife, To make an asse of her beloved husband Without good ground, but if they will be drawne To any reason by you, do not gull them; But if they grow conceited of themselves, And be fine Gentlemen, have no mercie, Publish them to the world, 'twill do them good When they shall see their follies understood, Go beare these letters to my servant, And bid him make hast, I will dresse my selfe, In all the journey cloathes I used before Not to ride but to make the laughter more. Exit. Enter. Gentleman. and Jaques. Gent. Is all pact up? Ja. All, all Sir, there is no tumbler, Runs throw his hoop with more dexteritie Then I aboute this businesse: tis a day That I have long longd to see. Gent. Come wheres my spurs? Ja. Here Sir, and now 'tis come. Gent. I Jaques now I thanke my fates, I can command my wife. Ja. I am glad to see it Sir. Gent. I do not love alwayes, To be made a puppie, Iaques. Ja. But yet me thinkes your worship does not looke, Right like a countrey Gentleman. Gent. I will, give me my tother hat. Ja. Here. Gen. So, my Ierkin. Ja. Yes Sir. Gent. On with it Jaques, thou and I Will live so finely in the countrey, Jaques, And have such pleasant walks into the woods A mornings, and then bring whom riding rods, And walking stavesâ Ja. And I will beare them Sir, And skurdge-sticks for the children. Gen. So thou shalt, And thou shalt do all, over see my worke folkes And at the weekes end pay them all their wages. Ja. I will Sir, so your worship give me mony. Gent. Thou shalt receive all too: give me my drawers Ja. They are ready Sir. Gent. And I will make thy Mistriss, My wife, looke to her landrie and her dayry, That we may have our linnen cleane on Sundayes. Ja. And holy dayes. Gent. I and ere we walke about the grounds Provide our breake-fast, Or she shall smoke, I'le have her a good huswife She shall not make a voyage to her sisters, But she shall live at home, And feed her pullen fat, and see her maides In bed before her, and locke all the doores Ja. Why that will be a life for Kings and Queenes. Gen. Give me my Scarfe with the great button quickly. Ia. 'Tis done Sir. Gen. Now my Mittens. Ia. Here they are Sir. Gen. 'Tis well? now my great dagger. Ia. There. Gen. Why so; thus it should be, now my riding rod. Iaq. There's nothing wanting Sir. Gen. Another, man, to sticke under my girdle. Ia. There it is. Gen. All is well. Ia. Why now me thinks your Worship looks Like to your selfe, a man of meanes and credit, So did your grave and famous Ancestors, Ride up and down to faires, and cheapen cattell. Gent. Goe, hasten your Mistrisse, Sirra. Ia. It shall be done. Exit Iaques. Enter servant and Page. Ser. Who's that? who's that boy? Page. I thinke it be my Master. Ser. Who, he that walkes in gray whisking his riding rod? Page. Yes Sir, 'tis he. Ser. 'Tis he indeed; he is prepar'd For his new journey; when I wink upon you Runne out and tell the Gentleman 'tis timeâ Monsieur good day. Gen. Monsieur your Mistrisse is within, but yet not ready. Ser. My businesse is with you Sir; 'tis reported, I know not whether by some enemie Maliciously that envies your great hopes, And would be ready to sow discontents Betwixt his Majesty and you, or truly, Which on my faith I would be sorry for, That you intend to leave the Court in hast. Gen. Faith Sir within this halfe houre. Iaques? Iaques within: Sir? Gen. Is my wife ready? Ia. Presently. Ser. But Sir, I needs must tell you as I am your friend, You should have tane your journey privater For 'tis already blaz'd about the Court. Gen. Why Sir, I hope it is no Treason, is it? Ser. 'Tis true Sir, but 'tis grown the common talk, There's no discovery else held, and in the presence All the Nobility and Gentry Have nothing in their mouths but only this, Monsieur Marine that noble Gentleman, Is now departing hence, every mans face Looks ghastly on his fellows, such a sadnesse (Before this day) I nere beheld in Court, Mens hearts begin to faile them when they heare it, In expectation of the great event That needs must follow it, pray heaven it be good! Gen. Why I had rather all their hearts should faile Then I stay here untill my purse faile me. Ser. But yet you are a Subject, and beware I charge you by the love I beare to you How you doe venture rashly on a course To make your soveraign jealous of your deeds For Princes jealousies where they love most, Are easily found, but they be hardly lost. Gen. Come these are tricks, I smell 'em, I will goe. Ser. Have I not still profest my selfe your friend? Gen. Yes, but you never shewd it to me yet. Ser. But now I will, because I see you wise, And give ye thus much light into a businesse That came to me but now, be resolute, Stand stifly to it that you will depart, And presently. Gen. Why so I meane to doe. Ser. And by this light you may be what you will; Will you be secret Sir? Gen. Why? what's the matter? Ser. The King does feare you. Gent. How? Ser. And is now in Counsell; Gent. About me; Ser. About you, and you be wise, You'l finde hee's in Counsell about you? His Councellours have told him all the truth. Gent. What truth? Ser. Why? that which now he knows too well. Gent. What is't? Ser. That you have followed him seven years With a great traine: and though he have not grac't you, Yet you have div'd into the hearts of thousands, With liberality and noble carriage; And if you should depart home unprefer'd All discontented, and seditious spirits Would flocke to you and thrust you into action: With whose help, &amp; your Tenants, who doth not know (If you were so dispos'd:) How great a part of this yet fertile peaceful realm of Fran. You might make desolate? but when the King Heard thisâ Gent. what said he? Ser. Nothing, but shook, As never Christian Prince did shake before. And to be short you may be what you will? But be not ambitious Sir, sit downe With moderate honours, least you make your selfe More feard. Gent. I know Sir what I have to doe In mine own businesse. Enter Longavile. Long. Where's Monsieur Mount Marine. Ser. Why there he stands, will you ought with him? Long. Yes: Good day Monsieur Marine. Gent. Good day to you. Long. His Majesty doth commend himselfe, Most kindly to you Sir, and hath by me, Sent you this favour: kneele downe, rise a Knight. Gent. I thank his Majesty. Long. And he doth further request you, Not to leave the Court so soone, For though your former merits have been slighted, After this time there shall no Office fall; Worthy your spirit, as he doth confesse There's none so great, but you shall surely have it. Ser. Do you heare, if you yield yet you are an asse. Gent. I'le shew my service to his Majesty In greater things then these, but for this small one I must intreat his Highnesse to excuse me. Long. I'le beare your Knightly words unto the King, And bring his Princely answer backe againe. Exit Long. Ser. VVell said, be resolute a while, I know There is a tide of honours comming on. I warrant you. Enter Bewford. Bew. VVhere is this new made Knight? Gent. Here Sir. Bew. Let me enfold you in my arms, Then call you Lord, the King will have it so, Who doth entreat your Lordship to remember His message sent to you by Longavile. Ser. If ye be durty, and dare not mount aloft; You may yield now, I know what I would do. Gent. Peace, I will fit him; tell his Majesty I am a Subject, and I do confesse I serve a gracious Prince, that thus hath heapt Honours on me without desert, but yet As for the message, businesse urgeth me, I must be gone, and he must pardon me, Were he ten thousand Kings and Emperours. Bew. I'le tell him so. Ser. Why, this was like your selfe. Bew. As he hath wrought him, 'tis the finest fellow That ere was Christmas Lord, he carries it So truly to the life, as though he were One of the plot to gull himselfe. Exit Bewf. Ser. Why so, you sent the wisest and the shrewdest Unto the King, I swear, my honoured friend That ever any Subject sent his Liege. Gent. Nay now I know I have him on the hip, I'le follow it. Enter Longavile. Long. My honourable Lord, Give me your noble hand right courteous Peer, And from henceforth be a courtly Earl; The King so wills, and Subjects must obey: Only he doth desire you to consider Of his request. Ser. Why faith you'r well my Lord, yield to him. Gent. Yield? why 'twas my plot. Ser. Nay 'twas your wives plot. Gent. To get preferment by it, And thinks he now to pop me ith mouth But with an Earldome, Ile be one step higher. Ser. 'Tis the finest Lord, I am afraid anon He will stand upon't to share the Kingdome with him. Enter Bewford. Bew. Wher's this Courtly Earle? His Majesty commends his love unto you; And will you but now grant to his request, He bids you be a Duke, and chuse of whence. Ser. Why if you yield not now, you are undone, What can you wish to have more, but the Kingdome? Gent. So please his Majesty, I would be Du. of Burgundy Because I like the place. Bew. I Know the King is pleas'd. Gen. Then will I stay and kisse his Highnesse hand. Bew. His Majesty wil be a glad man when he hears it. Lon. But how shall we keep this from the worlds eare That some one tell him not, he is no Duke? Ser. Wee'l think of that anon. Why Gentlemen, is this a gracious habit for a Duke? Each gentle body set a finger to To pluck the clouds of this his riding weeds From off the orient sunne of his best cloths; I'le pluck one boot and spur off. Long. I another. Bew. Ile pluck his Jerkin off. Ser. Sit down my Lord; Both his spurs off at once good Longavile And Bewford take that scarfe off, and that hat Doth not become his largely sprouting fore-head. Now set your gracious foot to this of mine, One pluck will do it, so, off with the other. Lon. Loe thus your servant Longavile doth pluck The trophy of your former gentry off, Off with his Jerkin Bewford. Ser. Didst thou never see A nimble footed Taylor stand so in his stockings, Whilst some friend help to pluck his Jerkin off, To dance a Jigg? Enter Jaques. Lon. Here's his man Jaques come Booted and ready still. Ja. My Mistris stayes; Why how now Sir? what do your Worship mean, To plucke your grave and thrifty habit off? Gent. My slippers, Jaques. Lon. O thou mighty Duke Pardon this man, That thus hath trespassed in ignorance. Gent. I pardon him. Lon. His Graces slippers, Jaques. Ia. Why what's the matter? Lon. Foot-man, hee's a Duke: The King hath rais'd him above all his land. Ja. I'le to his Couzen presently, and tell him so; O what a dung-hill countrey rogue was I! Exit Iaques. Enter Wife. Ser. See, see, my Mistrisse. Lon. Let's observe their greeting. Wife. Unto your will as every good wife ought, I have turnd all my thoughts, and now am ready. Gent. O Wife I am not worthy to kisse the least Of all thy toes, much lesse thy thumb, Which yet I would be bold with; all thy counsell Hath been to me Angelicall, but mine to thee Hath been most durty like my mind: Deare Duchesse I must stay. Wife. What are you mad to make me Dresse, and undresse, turne and winde me, Because you find me plyant? said I not The whole world should not alter me, if once I were resolv'd? and now you call me Duchesse: Why what's the matter? Gent. Loe a Knight doth kneel. Wife. A Knight? Gent. A Lord. Wife. A foole. Gent. I say doth kneele an Earle, a Duke. Long. In drawers. Bew. Without shoes. Wife. Sure you are lunatick. Ser. No honoured Duchesse If you dare but believe your servants truth, I know he is a Duke. Long. God save his Grace. Wife. I aske your Graces pardon. Gent. Then I rise, And here in token that all strife shall end 'Twixt thee and me, I let my drawers fall And to thy hands I do deliver them: Which signifies, that in all acts and speeches, From this time forth my wife shall wear the breeches. Ser. An honourable composition. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Cousen and Iaques. Cous. Shall I beleeve thee Iaques. Ja. Sir you may. Cous. Didst thou not dreame? Ja. I did not. Coz. Nor imagine? Ja. Neither of both: I saw him great and mighty, I saw the Monsieurs bow, and heard them cry Good health and fortune to my Lord the Duke. Cous. A Duke art sure? a Duke? Ja. I am sure a Duke, And so sure as I know my selfe for Jaques. Cous. Yet the sun may dazell? Jaques, was it not Some leane Commander of an angry Block-house To keep the sleamish Eele-boats from invasion, Or some bold Baron able to dispend His fifty pounds a yeare, and meet the foe Upon the Kings command in gilded canvas, And do his deeds of worth? or was it not Some place of gaine, as Clerk to the great Band Of maribones, that people call the Switzers? Men made of beufe, and sarcenet? Ja. Is a Duke his chamber hung with Nobles like a presence? Cous. I am something wavering in my faith; Would you would settle me, and sweare 'tis so, Is he a Duke indeed? Ja. I sweare he is. Cous. I am satisfied, he is my Kinsman-Jaques, And I his poor unworthy Couzen. Ja. True Sir. Cous. I might have been a Duke too, I had meanes, A wife as faire as his, and as wise as his; And could have brookt the Court as well as his, And laid about her for her husbands honour: O Jaques had I ever dreamt of this, I had prevented him. Ja. Faith Sir it came Above our expectation, we were wise Only in seeking to undoe this honour, Which shewed our dung-hill breeding and our durt. Cous. But tell me Iaques, Why could we not perceive? what dull Divell Wrought us to crosse this noble course, perswading 'Twould be his overthrow? for me a Courtier Is he that knows all, Iaques, and does all, 'Tis as his noble Grace hath often said, And very wisely, Jaques, we are fooles, And understand just nothing. Ia. I, as we were, I confesse it. But rising with our great Master, We shall be call'd to knowledge with our places, 'Tis nothing to be wise, not thus much there, Ther's not the least of the billet dealers, Nor any of the Pastry, or the Kitchin, But have it in measure delicate. Coz. Me thinks this greatness of the Dukes my Couzens (I aske you mercy, Iaques, that near name Is too familiar for me) should give promise Of some great benefits to his attendants. Ja. I have a suite my selfe, and it is sure, Or I mistake my ends much. Cous. What is't Iaques, May I not crave the place? Ja. Yes Sir you shall, 'Tis to be but his Graces Secretary, Which is my little all, and my ambition, Till my known worth shall take me by the hand And set me higher; how the fates may do In this poor threed of life is yet uncertaine; I was not born I take it for a trencher, Nor to espouse my Mistris Dairy-maid. Cous. I am resolv'd my wife shall up to Court; I'le furnish her, that is a speeding course, And cannot chuse but breed a mighty fortune; What a fine youth was I, to let him start, And get the rise before me? I'le dispatch And put my selfe in moneys. Ja. Masse 'tis true, And now you talke of money, Sir my businesse For taking those Crowns must be dispatcht; This litle plot in the Countrey lies most fit To do his Grace such serviceable uses, I must about it. Cous. Yet before you goe Give me your hand, and bear my humble service To the great Duke your Master, and his Duchesse, And live your selfe in favour: say my wife Shall there attend them shortly, so farewell. Ja. I'le see you mounted Sir. Cous. It may not be, Your place is far above it, spare your selfe, And know I am your servant, fare ye well. Exit Cousen. Ja. Sir I shall rest to be commanded by you; This place of Secretary will not content me, I must be more and greater, let me see, To be a Baron is no such great matter As people take it: for say I were a Count, I am still an under person to this Duke, Which me thinks sounds but harshly: but a Duke? O I am strangely taken, 'tis a Duke Or nothing, I'le advise upont, and see What may be done by wit and industry. Exit. Enter Wife, Longoveil, Bewford, Servants. Wife. It must be carried closely with a care That no man speak unto him, or come near him Without our private knowledge, or be made Afore-hand to our practice: My good husband I shall entreat you now to stay a while, And prove a noble coxcomb: Gentlemen, Your counsell and advice about this carriage. Ser. Alas good man, I do begin to mourn His dire massacre: what a persecution Is pouring down upon him? sure he is sinfull. Long. Let him be kept in's chamber under shew Of state and dignity, and no man sufferd To see his noble face, or have accesse, But we that are Conspirators. Bew. Or else down with him into the countrey amongst his Tenants, There he may live far longer in his greatnesse, And play the foole in pomp amongst his fellows. Wife. No, he shall play the foole in the City, and stay I will not loose the greatnesse of this jest That shal be given to my wit for the whole revenues. Ser. Then thus wee'l have a guard about his person, That no man come too neare him, and ourselves Alwayes in company; have him into the City To see his face swell; whilst in divers corners, Some of our own appointing shall be ready To cry heaven blesse your Grace, long live your Grace. Wife. Servant, your counsells excellent good, And shall be followed, twill be rarely strange To see him stated thus, as though he went A shroving through the City, or intended To set up some new stake: I shall not hold From open laughter when I heare him crye Come hither my sweet Dutchesse: let me kisse Thy gracious lips: for this will be his phrases? I feare me nothing but his legs will breake Under his mighty weight of such a greatnesse. Bew. Now me thinks dearest Lady you are too cruell; His very heart will freeze in knowing this. Wife. No, no, the man was never of such deepnesse To make conceite his Master: Sir I'le assure ye He will out-live twenty such pageants. Were he but my Cozen or my Brother, And such a desperate killer of his fortune, In this beliefe he should dye, though it cost me A thousand crowns a day to hold it up; Or were I not known his wife, and so to have An equall feeling of this ill he suffers, He should be thus till all the boyes i'th Towne Made sute to weare his badges in their hats, And walke before his Grace with sticks and nose-gayes, We married women holdâ Ser. 'Tis well, no more. The Duke is entring, set your faces right, And bow like Countrey prologues: here he comes. Make roome afore, the Duke is entring. Enter Duke. Long. The choicest fortunes waite upon our Duke, Ser. And give him all content and happinesse. Bew. Let his great name live to the end of time. Duke. We thank you, and are pleas'd to give you notice We shall at fitter times wait on your Loves, Till when, be neare Us. Long. 'Tis a valiant purge, and works extreamly; 'T as delivered him Of all Right worshipfull and gentle humours, And left his belly full of noblenesse. Du. It pleased the King my Master For sundry vertues not unknown to him, And the all-seeing state, to lend his hand And raise me to this Emminence, how this May seeme to other men, or stir the mindes Of such as are my fellow Peers, I know not, I would desire their loves in just designes. Wife. Now by my faith he does well, very well: Beshrew my heart I have not seen a better Of a raw fellow, that before this day Never rehearst his state: 'tis marvellous well. Ser. Is he not Duke indeed, see how he lookes As if his spirit were a last, or two Above his veines, and stretcht his noble hide. Long. Hee's high brac't like a drum, pray God he breake not. Bew. Why let him break, ther's but a Calves-skin lost. Long. May it please your Grace to see the City, Twill be to the minds and much contentment Of the doubtfull people. Du. I am determin'd so, till my returne I leave my honoured Dutchesse to her chamber. Be carefull of your health, I pray you be so. Ser. Your grace shall suffer us your humble servants To give attendance fit so great a person Upon your body. Duke. I am pleased so. Long. Away good Bewford, raise a guard sufficient To keep him from the reach of tongues, be quicke; And do you heare, remember how the streets Must be dispos'd with for cryes, and salutations. Your grace determines not to see the Kingâ Du.

Exeunt Duke &amp; traine. Wife. 'Tis fit he should have room to shew his mightinesse, He swels so with his poyson, 'Tis better to reclaim ye thus, then make A sheeps-head of you, It had been but your due; But I have mercy Sir, and mean to reclaim you By a directer course. That woman is not worthy of a soule That has the soveraign power to rule her husband, And gives her title up, so long provided As there be faire play, and his state not wrongd. Enter Shattillion. Shat. I would be glad to know whence this new Duke springs, The people buz abroad, or by what title He received his dignity, 'tis very strange There should be such close jugling in the State, But I am tyed to silence, yet a day May come, and soone to perfect all these doubts. Wife. It is the mad Shattillion by my soule I suffer much for this poor Gentleman; I'le speake to him, may be he yet knows me Monsieur Shattillion. Shat. Can you give me reason from whence This great Duke sprang that walkes abroad? Wife. Even from the King himselfe. Shat.

Wife. With all my heart; My feeling of his griefe and losse is much. Love. Sir now you are come so neare the prison, wil ye Goe in, and visit your fair Love: poore soule She would be glad to see you. Shat. This same Duke is but Apocryphall, there's no creation That can stand where titles are not right. Love. 'Tis true Sir. Shat. This is another draught upon my life; Let me examine well the words I spake. The words I spake were, that this novell Duke Is not ot'h true making, 'tis to me most certaine. Wife. You are as right Sir as you went by line. Shat. And to the griefe of many thousands more. Wife. If there be any such, God comfort them. Shat. Whose mouths may open when the time shall please; I'me betraid, commend me to the King, And tell him I am sound, and crave but justice; You shall not need to have your guard upon me, Which I am sure are plac'd for my attachment; Lead on; I'm obedient to my bonds. Love. Good Sir be not displeased with us; We are but servants to his highnesse will, To make that good. Shat. I doe forgive you even with my heart; Shall I entreat a favour? Wife. Any thing. Shat. To see my love before that fatall stroake, And publish to the world my christian death, And true obedience to the Crown of France. Love. I hope it shall not need Sir, for there is mercy As well as justice in his Royall heart. Exeunt. Enter three Gentlemen. 1 Gen.

Ja. Fye how these streets are charg'd and swell'd With these fame rascally people? give more room, Or I shall have occasion to distribute A martial almes amongst you; as I am a Gentleman I have not seen such rude disorder, They follow him like a prize, there's no true gaper Like to your Citizen, he will be sure The beares shall not passe by his door in peace, But he and all his family will follow. Roome there afore? Sound? Enter Duke and his company. Ja. Give roome, and keep your places And you may see enough; keep your places. Long.

O, For a stronger lace to keep my breath That I may laugh the nine dayes till the wonder Fall to an ebb: the high and mighty Duchesse? The high and mighty God what a stile is this?

Exit Jaques Wife. I would desire your Graceâ Du. You shall desire, and have your Full desire, sweet Duchesse speak. Wife.

Duke. Now give me leave, I grant you this your title At the first sight carryes some shew of truth; But if ye weigh it well ye shall finde light. Is not his Majestie possest in peace, And justice executed in his name, And can you thinke the most Christian King Would do this if he saw not reason for it? Shat. But had not the tenth Lewis a sole daughter? Duke. I cannot tell. Shat. But answer me directly. Duke. It is a most seditious question. Shat. Is this your justice? Duke. I stand for my King. Shat.

Long. Shall we desire your name and businesse Sir, And wee will presently informe him of you. Co. My name is Cleremont Ser. You are his graces kinsman, Of I am much mistaken; Co. You are right, Some of his noble blood runs through these veines, Though far unworthy of his graces knowledge. Long. Sir we must all be yours; his graces kinsman, And we so much forgetfull? 'twas a rudenesse, And must attend your pardon, thus I crave it: First to this beauteous Lady, whom I take To be your wife Sir, next your mercie. Cous. You have it Sir, I do not like this kissing, It lyes so open to a world of wishes. Ser. This is the merry fellow, this is he That must be noble too. Long. And so he shall. If all the art I have can make him noble, I'le dub him with a Knight-hood; if his wife VVill be but forward, and joyne issue, I like her above excellent. Ser. VVilt please you To walke a turne or two, whilst to the Duke VVe make your comming known? Exit Ser. &amp; Long. Cous. I shal attend, Sir. Wife. These Gentlemen are very proper men, And kisse the best that ere I tasted. For goodnesse-sake husband let us never more Come neare the Countrey, what so ere betide us; I am in malice with the memory Of that same stinking dung-hill. Cous. VVhy now you are my chicken and my dear, Love where I love, hate where I hate, now You shall have twenty gownes, and twenty chaines, See, the doore is opening. Groom.

Most gracious Duke, my poor Spouse &amp; my selfe Do kisse your mighty foote, and next to that The great hand of your Duchesse, ever wishing Your honours ever-springing, and your yeares. Du. Cozen? Cous. Your Graces vassall, far unworthy The nearnesse of your blood. Du. Correct me not, I know the word I speake, And know the person. Though I be something higher then the place VVhere common men have motion, and discending Down with my eye, their formes are lessened to me, Yet from this pitch can I behold my owne, From millions of those men that have no marke, And in my fearfull stoop, can make them stand. VVhen others feele my soule and perish, Cozen Be comforted, you are very welcome, so Is your faire wife: the charge of whom I give To my own dearest and best beloved. Tell me, have you resolv'd your selfe for Court, And utterly renounce the slavish Countrey, VVith all the cares thereof? Cous. I have sir. Du. Have you dismist your eating houshold, Sold your hangings of Nebuchadnezar, for such they were, As I remember, with the furnitures Belonging to your beds and chambers? Cous. I Sir. Du.

All this I have perform'd. Du. Then lend me all your hands, I will embrace my Cozen VVho is an understanding Gentleman, And with a zeale mighty as is my name, Once more I bid you welcome to the Court; My state againe. Duch.

Cozen, you see this mighty man here: he was an asse When he came first to towne: indeed he was Just such another coxcomb as your husband, God blesse the mark and every good mans childe! This must not stir you Cozen. Wife. Heaven forbid? Long. Sweet Maria, provide the cushion ready for it. Mar. It shall be done. Du. Receive all your advices from our selfe, Be once a day with us, and so farewell For this time, my faire Cozen; Gentlemen Conduct him to his lodging. Duch. Farewell, and think upon my words. Wife. I shall observe them. Exit Duke and Duchesse. Cous. Health, and the Kings continuall love attend you. Ser. O for a private place to ease my lungs! Heaven give me patience, such a paire of Jades Were never better ridden to this houre, Pray heaven they hold out to the journeys end. Long. Twitch him aside good Monsieur, whilst I breake Upon the body of his strength, his wife, I have a constant promise: she is my own. Ser. Ply her to wind-ward Monsieur, you have taken The most compendious way to raise your selfe, That could have been delivered by a councell. Cous. I have some certaine aimes Sir: but my wifeâ Ser. Your wife? you must not let that trouble you. Cous. It will Sir, to see her in a strangers armes. Ser. What mean you? let her alone, be wise, stir not a foot For if you do, all your hopes are buryed: I sweare you are a lost man if you stir. Cous. I thanke you Sir, I will be more advis'd. Ser. But what great Office do you levell at? Cous. Sir, they are kissing. Ser. Let them kisse, And much may do their good hearts; they must kisse And kisse, and double kisse, and kisse againe, Or you may kisse the post for any rising: Had your noble Kinsman ever mounted To these high Spheres of honour, now he moves in, But for the kisses of his wife? Cous. I Know not. Ser. Then I doe; credite me, he had been lost, A fellow of no mark, and no repute, Had not his wife kist soone, and very sweetly She was an excellent woman, and dispatcht him To his full, being in a moment Sirâ Exit Long. &amp; Wife. Cous. But yet me thinks he should not take her Sir Into a private roome. Ser. Now stand and flourish, You are a made man for ever. I doe envy you if you stand your fortunes up, You are the happiest man: but your great Cozen This day in Court: well I will marry surely, And not let every man out-run me thus. 'Tis time to be mine owne friend, I live In towne here, and direct the readiest way, To other men, and be a slave my selfe. Co. Nay good Sir be not mov'd, I am your servant, And will not be ungratefull for this knowledge. Ser. Will you be walking home? Co. I would desire to have my wife a long. Ser. You are too raw, Be gon and take no notice where you left her, Let her returne at leisure, if the stay A moneth 'twill be the better, understand me This Gentleman can doe't. (Exit Cozen. Co.

Monsieur Bewford, Monsieur Bewford. Bew. Whose that calls? Long. Are you a bed? Bew. No Sir, the hangings. Enter Long. Long. Nay Mounsieur, I'le forbid that, we'le have faire play Lend me your candle, are you taken Bewford? A lecher of your practice, and close carriage To be discovered thus? I am a sham'd So great a Master in his art should faile, And stagger in his grounds. Bew.

Long. Yes, I am believing, and God give you joy. Bew. My loving wife I will not wrong thee, Since I am thine and only loved of thee From this houre I, vow my selfe a new man, Be not jealous: for though I had a purpose, To have spent an hower or two in solace otherwise, And was provided for it, yet my love Shall put a better temper to my blood, Come out thou woman of unholsome life, Be sorry for thy sinnes, and learne to mend, Nay never hide your face, you shall be seene.

I am he, by miracle preserv'd to be that Jaques, Within this two houres Gentlemen, poore Jaques Was but as coarse in grave: a man of wisedome, That of my conscience if he had his right Should have a pretty state, but that's all one That noble Gentleman did save this life, I keepe it for him, 'tis his owne.

Not gon unto my Tenants to relate My grace and honour; and the mightynesse Of my new name which would have struck a terrour Through their course doublets, to their very hearts? Ja. Alas great Lord and Master, I could scarce With safety of my life returne againe Unto your graces house, and but for one That had some mercie, I had sure been hang'd. Duke. My house? Ja. Yes Sir, this house, your house 'ith towne. Duke. Jaques we are displeas'd, hath it no name? Ja. What name? Duke. Dull rogue; what hath the King bestowed So many honours, open'd all his springes, And showerd his graces downe upon my head, And has my house no name? no title yet? Burgundy house you Asse. Ja. Your graces mercy, And when I was come off, and had recover'd Burgundy house, I durst not yet be seene, But lay all night for feare of pursuiuants In Burgundy privie house. Duke. O Sir, 'tis well, Can you remember now? but Jaques know Since thy intended journey is so croste, I will go downe my selfe this morning. Ja. Sir? Duke. Have I not said this morning? Ja. But consider, That nothing is prepared yet for your journey, Your graces teames not here to draw your cloathes; And not a carrier yet in town to send by. Duke. I say once more go about it, You'r a wise man, you'de have me linger time, Till I have worne these cloathes out: will ye go? Make ye ready wife. Exit. Jaques. Enter Wife. Dutches. I am so, mighty Duke. Duke. Nay for the Countrey. Dutch. How? for the Countrey? Duke. Yes I am resolv'd to see my Tenants in this bravery Make them a sumptuous feast, with a slight shew, Of Dives, and Lazarus, and a squib or two, And so returne. Dutches. VVhy Sir? you are not mad? Duke. How many Dukes have ye known mad? I pray speake. Dutch. You are the first Sir, and I hope the last, But you are stark horne mad. Duke. Forbeare good wife. Dutch. As I have faith you'r mad: your hornes Have been to heavy for you, and have broke Your skull in pieces: If you be in earnest. Duke. VVell you shall know my skull and wits are whole Ere I have done, and yet I am in earnest. Dutches. VVhy, do you think I'le go? Duke. I know you shall. Dutch. I shall? by what authority shall I? Duke. I am your husband. Dutch. True I confesse it, And by that name the world hath given you A power to sway me; but Sir you shall know There is a greater bond that tyes me here, Alleagance to the King; has he not heapt Those honours on you to no other end, But to stay you here, and shall I have a hand In the offending such a gracious Prince? Besides, our owne undoings lyes uppon 't, Were there no other cause, I do not see, Why you should go: If I should say you should not. Duke. Do you thinke so? Dutch. Yes faith. Duke. Now good wife make me understand that point. Dutch. Why that you shall, did I not bring you hither? Duke. Yes. Dutch. And were not all those honours wrought out of the fire by me? Duke. By you? Dutch. By me; how strang you make it? When you came first did you not walke the Town, In a long cloake halfe compasse? an old hat, Linde with vellure, and on it for a band, A skeine of crimson cruell? Duke. I confesse it. Dutch. And tooke base courses? Duke. Base? Dutch. Base by this light, extreame base, and scurvie, monstrous base. Duke. What were these courses, wife? Dutch. Why you shall know, Did you not thus attired trot up and down, Plotting for vild and lowsie offices, And agreed with the Sergiant of the beares, To buy his place? deny this if you can. Duke. Why it is true. Dutch. And was not that monstrous base? Duke. Be advis'd wife, a beares a princly beast. Dutch. A beare? Duke. Yes wife, and one side venson. Dutch. You'r more then one side toole, I'm sure of that Duke. But since you have vext me wife, know you shall go Nor you shall never have penny from me. Dutch. Nay I have done, and though I know 'twill be Your overthrow, I'le not forsake you now. Duke. Be ready them. Exit Duke. Dutch. I will. Enter Bewf. Long. Serua. Maria. Long. What are you married Bewford? Bew. I as fast as words, and hearts, and hands &amp; Priest can make us. Dutch. O Gentlemen, we are undone. Long. For what? Dutch. This Gentleman the Lord of lorne my husband, Will be gon downe to shew his play fellowes, Where he is gay. Bew. What, downe into the Countrey? Dutch. Yes faith, was ever foole but he so crosse? I would as faine be gracious to him, As he could wish me, but he will not let me; Speake faithfully, will he deserve my mercy? Long. According to his merits he should weare, A guarded coate, and a great wooden dagger. Dutch. If there be any woman that doth knowe, The duties 'twixt a husband and his wife, Will speake but one word for him he shall scape; Is not that reasonable? but ther's none, Be ready therefore, to pursue the plot We had against a pinch, for he must stay. Long. VVaite you here for him whilst I go And make the King acquainted with your sport, For feare he be incens'd for our attempting; Places of so great honour. Exit Long. Dutch. Go, be speedy. Enter Duke, Cozen, Wife, Jaques, Man. Duke. Come let me see how all things are disposed of. Ja. One Cart will serve for all your furniture, With roome enough behinde to ease the footman A capcase for your linnen, and your plate, VVith a strange locke that opens with Amen; For my young Lord because of easie portage, A quiver of your graces linde with Cunney, Made to be hang'd about the Nurses neck, Thus with a scarfe or towell. Duke. Very good. Ja. Nay, 'tis well, but had you staid another weeke, I would have had you, furnisht in such pomp, As never Duke of Burgundy was furnisht You should have had a sumpter though't had cost me The laying on my selfe: where now you are faine, To hire a rippers mare, and buy new dossers, But I have got them painted with your armes, VVith a faire darnex Carpet of my owne Laid crosse for the more state. Duke. Jaques I thanke you: your Carpet shall be brusht And sent you home; what, are you ready wife? Dutch. An houre agoe Duke. I cannot chuse but kisse thy royall lips, Deare Dutches mine, thou art so good a woman. Bew. Yould say so if you knew all, goodman Duckling. Coz. This was the happiest fortune could befall me Now in his absence will I follow close Mine owne preferment, and I hope ere long, To make my meane and humble name so strong, As my great Couzens, when the world shall know, I beare too hot a spirit to live low The next Spring wil I down my wife and houshold, I'le have My Ushers, and my foure Lacquies, Six spare croches too: but mum, no more, What I intend to do, I'le keep in store. Duke. Mountye, mountye, Iaques, be our querry. Groom. To horse there Gentlemen, and fall in couples. Duke. Come honoured Duchesse. Enter Longavile. Long. Stand thou proud man. Duke. Thieves, Iaques, raise the people. Long. No, raise no people, 'tis the Kings command, Which bids thee once more stand thou haughty man, Thou art a monster, for thou art ungratefull, And like a fellow of a rebell nature, Hast flung from his embraces: and for His honours given thee, hast not returnd So much as thanks, and to oppose his will, Resolv'd to leave the Court, and set the Realm A fire, in discontent, and open action: Therefore he bids thee stand thou proud man, Whilst with the whisking of my sword about I take thy honours off: this first sad whiske Takes off thy Duke-dome, thou art but an Earl. Duke. You are mistaken, Longavile. Long. O would I were, this second whiske divides Thy Earldome from thee, thou art yet a Baron. Duke. No more whisks if you love me Longavile. Long. Two whisks are past, and two are yet behind, Yet all must come, but not to linger time. With these two whisks I end, now Mount Marine, For thou art now no more, so says the King, And I have done his Highnesse will with griefe. Duke. Disgraced from my honours? Lon. 'Tis too certaine. Duke. I am no Traitor sure that I know of; Speak Iaques? hast thou ever heard me utter word Tending to treason, or to bring in the enemy? Ia. Alas sir I know nothing, Why should your Worship bring me in to hang me? God's my judge Gentlemen I never medled But with the Brushing of his cloaths, or fetching In water in a morning for his hands. Cous. Are these the honours of this place? Antony Help me to take her gowne off quickly Or I'le so swinge ye for'tâ Wife. Why husband? Sir? Cous. I'le not loose a penny by this towne. Long. Why what do you meane sir, have her to her lodging, And there undresse her, I will waite upon her. Cous. Indeed you shall not, your moneth is out I take it, Get you out before me wife: Couzen farewell, I told you long agoe, That pride begins with pleasure, ends with woe. Exit with's Wife. Bew. Goe thy way sentences, 'twill be thy fortune, To live and dye a Cuckold and Church-warden. Duch. O my poor husband! what a heavy fortune Is fallen upon him? Bew. Me thinks 'tis strange, That heaven fore-warning great men of their falls, With such plaine tokens, they should not avoid them? For the last night betwixt eleven and twelve, Two great and hideous blazing stars were seen To fight a long houre by the clocke, the one Drest like a Duke, the other like a King, Till at the last the crowned star ore-came. Ser. Why do ye stand so dead, Monsieur Marine? Duke. So CÃ¦sar fell when in the Capitoll They gave his body two and thirty wounds. Be warned all ye Peers, and by my fall, Hereafter learn to let your wives rule all. Ser. Monsieur Marine, pray let me speak with you; Sir I must wave you to conceale this party, It stands upon my utter overthrow; Seem not discontented, nor do not stir a foote, For if you do, you and your hopeâ I sweare you are a lost man if you stir. And have an eye to Bewford, he'l tempt you. Bew. Come, come, for shame goe downe; Were I Marine, by heaven I would goe down: And being there, I would rattle him such an answer Should make him smoake. Duke. Good Monsieur Bewford peace Leave these rebellious words, Or by the honours which I once enjoyed, And yet may sweare by, I'le tell the King of your proceedings; I am satisfied. Wife. You talkt of going down when 'twas not fit, But now let's see your spirit, A thousand and a thousand will expect it. Duke. Why wife, are you mad? Wife. No nor drunk, but I'de have you know your own strength. Duke. You talk like a most foolish woman wife; I tell you I will stay, yet I have a Cratchet troubles me. Long. More cratchets yet? Duke. Follow me Jaq. I must have thy counsell, I will returne againe, stay you there Wife. Long. I fear this losse of honour will give him some few stooles. Wife. No, no, he is resolv'd, he will not Stir a foote I'le lay my life. Bew. I but hee's discontented, how shall we resolve that And make him stay with comfort? Wife. Faith Bewford we must even let nature work, For hee's the sweetest temper'd man for that As one can wish, for let men but goe about to foole him, And hee'l have his finger as deep in't as the best; But see where he comes frowning, blesse us all! Enter Duke. Duke. Off with your hats, for here doth come The high and mighty Duke of Burgundy. What ever you may think, I have thought And thought, and thought upon't, and I finde it plaine, The King cannot take backe what he has given, Unlesse I forfeit it by course of Law. Not all the water in the river Sene, Can wash the blood out of these Princely veines. Wife. Godamercy husband, thou art the best To worke out a thing at a pinch, in France. Duke. I will ascend my state againe, Duchesse take your place, And let our Champion enter. Long. Has he his Champion? that's excellent. Duke. And let loud musick sound before his entrance. Sound Trumpet. Enter Iaques in armour, one carrying a Scuchion before him, and a two-handed sword. Wife. How well our Champion doth demean himselfe, As if he had been made for such an action? Me thinks his sturdy trunchion he doth wield, Like Mars approaching to a bloody field. Duke. I think ther's no man so desperate To dare encounter with our Champion, But trust me, Iaques, thou hast pleas'd us well; Once more our warlike musick, then proceed. En: Shat. Shat. What wondrous age is this? what close proceedings? I heare the clang of Trumpets in this house, To what intent do not our States-men search? O no, they look not into simple truth; For I am true, and they regard not me, A man in armour too: God save the King The world will end, theres nought but treachery. Ia. I Ja. servant to the high &amp; mighty Godfrey Duke of Burgundy, do come hither to prove by natural strength and activity of my body, without the help of sorcery, inchantment or negromancy, that the said Godfrey late of Mount Marine, &amp; now of Burgundy, hath perfect right therto, notwithstanding the Kings command to the contrary, &amp; no other person whatsoever: &amp; in token that I wilbe ready to make good the same. I throw down my gage, wc h is my honour, pronounced the 37. of Feb. stilo novo, God save the D. Shat. Of all the plots the King hath laid for me This was the shrewdest, 'tis my life they seeke, And they shall have it: if I should refuse To accept the challenge in the Kings behalfe, They have some cause to take away my life, And if I do accept it, who can tell, But I may fall by doubtfull chance of war? 'Twas shrewd, but I must take the least of evills, I take thy gauntlet up thou treacherous man, That stands in armed coate against the King, Whom God preserve, and with my single sword Will justifie what ever he commands; I'le watch him for catching of my words. Duke. Jaques goe on, defend our Princely title. Shat. Why shrinkst thou backe? thou hast an evill cause; Come forward man, I have a rocke about me, I fight for my true Liege. Du. Goe forward Jaques. Ja. I do beeseech your Grace to pardon me, I will not fight with him, with any else I'le shew my resolution speedily. Shat. Come do thy worst, for the King shall see All is not true that is reported of me. Ja. I may not fight with him by law of armes. Du. What? shall my title fall? wilt thou not fight? Ja. Never with him that once hath sav'd my life. Shat. Dar'st thou not fight? behold then I doe goe Strong with the zeale I beare my Soveraign, And seize upon that haughty man himselfe. Descend the steps that (thou hast thus usurpt Against the King and State) downe to the ground, And if thou doe utter but a syllable To crosse the Kings intent, thou art but dead; There, lye upon the earth and pine and dye. Did ever any man wade through such stormes, To save his life, as poore Shattillion? Long. I feare this challenge hath spoil'd all. Duch. Ne're feare it, hee'l work it out againe servant. See where Shattillions Love, poor Lady, comes. En: Love. Duke. Jaques. Ja. Lye still sir if you love your life, I'le whistle when he's gone, Love. O Gentlemen, I charge you by the love Which you beare to women, take some pitty On this distressed man, help to restore That pretious jewell to him he hath lost. Bew. Lady what ever power doth lye in us By art or prayer, or danger, we are yours, Love. A strange conceite hath wrought this malady, Conceites againe must bring him to himselfe, My strict denyall to his will wrought this? And if you could but draw his wilder thoughts To know me, he would sure recover sense. Long. That charge I'le undertake. Duke. Looke Jaques, look, for Gods sake let me rise, This greatnesse is a Jade, I cannot sit it. Ja. His sword is up, and yet he watcheth you. Du. I'le down again, pray for thy Master, Jaques. Shat. Now the King may see all the suggestions are not true, He hath receiv'd against my loyalty; When all men else refuse, I fight his battails, And thrust my body into dangers mouth; I am become his Champion, and this sword Has taught his enemies to know themselves; O that he would no more be jealous of me! Long. Monsieur Shattillion, the King assigns you, That for this valiant loyall act of yours, He hath forgot all jealousies and feares, And never more will tempt you into danger. Shat. But how shall I believe this? what new token Of reconcilement will he shew me? Let him release my poor love from her torment, From her hard fare and strict imprisonment. Long. He hath done this to win your after-love, And see your Lady sent you from the King By these two Gentlemen: be thankfull for her. Shat. She lives, she lives, I know her by the power Shoots from her eyes. Love. Rise deare Shattillion. Shat. I Know my duty, Next unto my King, I am to kneele to you. Love. I'le have you rise, fetch me a chair, sit down Shat. Shat. I am commanded, and faith tell me Mistris, What usage have you had? pray be plaine? Love. O my most lov'd Shattillion, paine enough, But now I am free, thanks to my God and King. Long. His eyes grow very heavy, not a word, That his weak senses may come sweetly home. Shat. The King is honourable. Duke. When do you whistle Jaques? Ja. By and by. Long. Come hither Monsieur, canst thou laugh a little? Ser. Yes Sir. Long. So thou shalt then. Bewford how dost thou? Bew. Why well. Long. I'me glad on't, and how does thy wife? Bew. Why you may see her Sir, she stands behind you. Lon. By the mass she's there indeed, but wher's her belly? Bew. Belly? Lon. Her great belly man: what hast thou sent thee? Ser. A boy I'le lay my life, it tumbled so. Bew. Catcht by this light. Long. I'le be a gossip Bewford. Ser. And I. Long. I have an odd Apostle spoone. Bew. S'foote catcht. Duch. Why what's the matter Gentlemen? Long. He's married to your woman. Duch. And I not know it? Ser. 'Twas a veniall sin. Bew. Gall, gall, gall. Duch. Forgive her Monsieur Bewford, 'twas her love. Bew. You may rise if you please, I must endure it. Long. See how my great Lord lyes upon the ground And dare not stir yet? Jaques, whistles? Duke. Jaques, Jaq. is the Kings Champion gone yet, Ja. No, but hee's asleep. Duke. Is he asleep art sure? Ia. I am sure he is, I heare him snore. Duke. Then by your favours Gentlemen I rise, And know I am a Duke still. Jaq. And I am his Champion. Duch. Hold thee there, and all France cannot mend thee. Du. I am a Prince as great within my thoughts As when the whole state did adorn my person; What tryall can be made to try a Prince? I will oppose this noble corps of mine To any danger that may end the doubt. Duch. Great Duke and husband there is but one way To satisfie the world of our true right, And it is dangerous. Duke. What may it be? Were it to bring the great Turke bound in chaines Through France in triumph: or to couple up The Sophie, and great Prester Iohn together, I would attempt it Duchesse, tell the course. Duch. There is a strong opinion through the world, And no doubt grounded on experience That Lyons will not touch a lawfull Prince, If you be confident then of your right, Amongst the Lions beare your naked body, And if you come off cleare and never winch, The world will say you are a perfect Prince. Du. I thank you Duchesse for your kinde advice, But now we do not affect those ravenous beasts. Long. A Lyon is a beast to try a King; But for the triall of such a state like this Pliny reports a mastive dog will serve. Du. We will not deale with dogs at all: but men. Ser. You shall not need to deale with them at all, Hark you Sir, the King doth know you are a Duke: Duke. No, does he? Ser. Yes, and is content you shall be, but with this caution, That none know it but your selfe: For if ye do, he'l take it away by act of Parliament. Du. Here's my hand, and whilst I live or breath, No living wight shall know I am a Duke. Ser. Marke me directly Sir, your wife may know it. Du. May not Jaques? Ser. Yes, he may. Du. May not my countrey Couzen? Ser. By no meanes sir, if you love your life and state. Du. Well then, know all I am no Duke. Ser. No I'le sweare it. Long. See he wakes. Shat. Where am I, or where have I been all this while? Sleep hath not sate so found upon mine eyes But I remember well that face; O thou too cruell, leave at length to scorne Him that but looking on thy beauty dyes, Either receive me, or put out my eyes. Love. Dearest Shattillion see upon my knees, I offer up my love, forget my wrongs. Shat. Art thou mine own? Love. By heaven I am. Shat. Then all the world is mine. Love. I have stranger things to tel thee, my dearest love. Shat. Tell nothing but that thou art mine own: I do not care to know where I have been, Or how I have liv'd, or any thing, But that thou art my own. Bew. Well wife, though 'twere a trick that made us wed, Wee'l make our selves merry soone in bed. Du. Know all I am no Duke. Wife. What saye? Du. Jaques? Ja. Sir. Du. I am a Duke. Both. Are yee? Duke. Yes faith, yes faith. But it must only run amongst our selves, And Jaques thou shalt be my Secretary still. Wife. Kinde Gentlemen, leade in Shattillion, For he must needs be weak and sickly yet. Now all my labours have a perfect end as I could wish, Let all young sprightly wives that have Dull foolish Coxcombs to their husbands, Learn by me their duties, what to doe, VVhich is to make 'em fooles, and please 'em too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Wit is become an anticke: and puts on As many shapes of variation, To court the times applause, as the times dare, Change severall fashions, nothing is thought rare Which is not new and follow'd, yet we know, That what was worne some twenty yeare agoe, Comes into grace againe, and we pursue That custome, by presenting to your view A play in fashion then, not doubting now But 'twill appeare the same, if you allow Worth to their noble memory, whose name, Beyond all power of death live in their fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. The Monuments of vertue and desert, Appeare more goodly when the glosse of art Is eaten off by time, then when at first They were set up, not censur'd at the worst. We have done our best for your contents to fit With new paines this old monument of wit.</field>
