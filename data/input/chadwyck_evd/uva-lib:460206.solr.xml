      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Selima and Seth. Selima. Hail happy day! sacred to wedded love! How pure and calm shines out thy chearful light! What happiness, surpassing all the joys My childish years have known, I taste this day! To view the labours of the virgin train Which deck my bridal bow'r, our mother Eve Hastes all delighted, and with hand maternal Entwines the clust'ring foliage. I mean-time Come forth to gather fruits of taste delicious, Which I have plac'd upon the tender grass, That so my brethren and my sisters, from The nuptial bow'r returning, may relieve Their toil with exquisite repast; around The ready fruits I've set the luscious grape; The sweetest shall be Eman's; for his taste Alone I pluck'd it, and have strew'd it o'er With shelt'ring leaves yet glist'ning with the dew. O happiness sincere! the virtuous Eman Deigns to make me his choice; yes Eman loves me. When the bright sun shall slope his western course Beneath th'horizon, then, for the first time, Shall Adam's daughters bring their infant sons Of three years growth, unto their genial sire, That he may bless them; that holy office done, Th'enraptur'd father, with a heart-felt joy, Shall lead us to the bow'r, and nuptial bed— My brother! why that downcast look of care? Why fades the smile upon thy lips? Seth. O Selima! The thought of thy approaching happiness Fills all thy brother's social breast; that thought Possesses me entire; and wherefore then Seem I to thee to wear the brow of grief? Selima. Alas! you answer in a tone of voice, Spite of yourself betraying secret woe. Seth. Know I a secret I'd conceal from thee? —It shall be so.—I had resolv'd indeed, To mourn in silence;—but my own frank nature, Thy tears, thy grief, and soft anxiety, Have wrench'd it from me. Yet, dearest sister, Let not this sorrow overwhelm thy soul. —Thou know'st how tenderly I love my father— Alas! while at the entrance of the bow'r Thy fond regards pursued our mother Eve, I saw him prostrate at the altar's foot Which Abel rais'd. Distress, and grief extreme, O'erspread his visage; and his troubled mind Seem'd labouring with uncommon weight of woe. —But without cause perhaps my tenderness Alarms me, and creates fantastic fears. Selima. Shall I go see him? With endearment kind I'll hang upon him, press his hands with mine, I'll look upon him with the looks of love And filial duty, I'll beseech, conjure him, To master all his woes.—O my dear brother! Alas! what means that sudden gush of tears, That course each other down your manly cheek? —Something of greater woe remains untold. Seth. Ah me! my sister, why from thy lov'd bow'r Linger thy steps so long?—O thou hast rent My very soul. My resolution faints; And to conceal the secret in my breast, I strive in vain;—already it escapes me. —Ne'er did my eyes, O Selima, behold My father such as he appears to-day. He pass'd me near; and all his countenance Seem'd faded. A dire paleness overspread it; His footsteps totter'd, and with efforts weak, He scarcely dragg'd his trembling limbs along. His eyes were fix'd immoveable on me, And yet he saw me not; he enter'd strait, And to the altar urg'd his feeble way. I heard him pray aloud; I saw him tremble With horror's agony; his struggling words, Choak'd up with grief in frequent broken sighs, Scarce forc'd a passage.—Since you came here, I have not heard him.—'Twas your request, and I Have nought concealed;—but listen, Selima, Dost thou not hear his steps? 'Tis he; this way The sire of men approaches. SCENE II. Adam, Seth, Selima. Adam. What sight is this? My son! my daughter! Seth with Selima! [Aside. This is a day of darkness and of terror; To you it will be golden, Selima; Go seek your mother, and, with her delighted, Cull flowrets sweet to deck thy fragrant bow'r, And dress thee gaily for thy nuptial day. Tell her, 'tis I command it; and moreover, That in submission to thy father's will, Thou wilt forbear the customary rites Of pairs new wedded for this day. Selima. O father! I obey. SCENE III. Adam. Seth. Adam. Excellent child! dear Selima! She has indeed a soul of virtue. Saw'st thou not, son, when thus compell'd to leave me, What tenderness and care unutterable Her looks, her gestures spake?—May righteous heav'n Pour down its choicest gifts of blessings on her! —O my son! the time, the moment is at hand, When I shall never look upon her more.— Such as she is to day, in that blest time Ere heav'n had curst the earth, such then was Eve. —On her, thou God Almighty, pow'r thy blessings. My son, my best of sons, attend my words; Thou know'st,—I know thou dost, the pow'r supreme, Creator of all beings, and reverest his laws. Thou art a man, and I dare prove thy virtues: Thou shalt know all,—come hither,—nearer yet,— Seth! my child! [Embraces him. I die to-day. Seth. O Adam! O my father! Adam. Dread amazement Clogs up expression.—He is silent.— How soon shall death, in adamantine silence, Close up my mouth, and that for ever! Seth, Look up, be more collected; thy sorrow Strikes heavily upon me, and I feel my heart Already bursting.—With attentive ear List to my words; a more tremendous voice Will wound thy father's ear, when he shall hear The name, the dreadful name of death:—thou alone Of all my children wilt behold me die. Thou wilt alone perform the last kind office. —Yes,—I'm as certain I shall die to-day As I was certain of my life, when first I rose from earth, and with erected visage Turn'd up my wond'ring eyes to gracious heav'n. As at the entrance of my verdant bow'r I sat, in calm tranquillity reflecting On the fond loves of Selim and of Eman, And to secure their bliss by wedded rites, A sudden shock daz'd all my senses;—no emotion Of awful fear, or pang of desperate grief;— No,—'twas th'approach, the sure approach of death. Death like a torrent rush'd thro' all my veins, And seem'd to crumble all my bones. To this shock An universal languor strait succeeded; Which, had it lasted, would have chain'd my tongue up As thine at present; nor grief found utt'rance But in half words, and sobbings inarticulate. —O Seth, my child, my well-beloved son, Brother of Abel!—yet I complain not Of my lost state;—Complaint is not for Adam. —From the dread moment of that fatal shock, The thought of death immediately possess'd me. This day, said I, will be my last; nor yet Can I shake off the black idea from me; It harrows up my soul:—where'er I go, Fear still pursues me, rushes thro' my veins, And paints strange fancies to my wand'ring eyes. But more remains behind, as yet untold. The sad rememb'rance of a dread event, To you unknown, now doubles all my woe. When now th'Eternal's terrible decree Had fixt my doom, and terror's keen sensations Scarce found a respite; lo! before me stood A spirit sent by God's permissive will, Th'angel of death! and with terrific voice Address'd me trembling thus:—“Remember, Adam, “Me thou shalt see again; and in that day “When thou shalt comprehend thy sentence past, “I will revisit thee.”—O my dear son, With strange affright I wait this messenger, More dreadful still, if not announc'd before. Lift up thy eyes, my child, to gracious heav'n; The God, who is his wrath remembers mercy, Will with the bitter of my sorrows here Mingle some sweet.—This prediction horrible, As yet, I know, is not at full accomplish'd; As yet, the meaning of those dreadful words I comprehend not, “Thou shalt die the death.” What torment 'tis, thou wilt be witness of; 'Tis not mere death appals me; ages now Have roll'd, nor ever found me unprepar'd; But 'tis the horror of a thing unknown, That agitates my soul. Seth. Oh my father! Oh heaven! will you then die? Adam. Flesh of my flesh! blood of my blood! my children! Oh! with what joy I could remain amongst you. Seth. Stay then, my father, midst your children stay; Live happy long, nor have a will to die. Adam. Leave me, my child, my soul is link'd to thine; And all the soft emotions of thy breast Strike with redoubled force on mine.—Leave me, And let us, with submissive awe, adore The judge whose sentence will'd my death. Seth. Prais'd, prais'd be his name;—but, my dear father, Your children know your tenderness extreme, And love parental; fear of separation Makes you regard that sudden shock of nature, As the fore-runner of approaching death, Which might arise but from the strength of health, That health robust which has resisted still, Vigorous and firm, and flourish'd many ages. Adam. Aside.] How can I answer to such filial love! Aloud.] O wretched, wretched Adam, perhaps e'en now Th'angel of death is near me; now perhaps He comes in terrors to announce my time, The dreadful moment which appals my soul.— Thou minister of terrors, dreadful angel, Appear not yet, nor with thy fearful aspect Shock my best, duteous child.—Seth, my son, Behold that shrine, thy brother Abel's altar; You see it stain'd with blood:—there turn thy steps, Lift up thy hands, thy soul to heav'n; if a day A single day be added to my years, That day thy pray'rs shall gain. Seth. Father, I obey. SCENE IV. Adam , solus. He's gone;—but were his pray'rs more fervent still, Great God! thou wilt not deign to grant them. —What dreadful horrors shake my soul agen! The faintness ceases, and o'er all my heart Rush wild affright and terrible dismay, And in their rear bring death.—I feel it now.— As yet, with trembling steps, I walk the earth; Soon to be mixt with it agen for ever. But should my dearest Eve, my children too;— Should they behold my death.—O dreadful thought! A thousand times more dreadful, than the image Of my corrupt and livid body.—Eve, My soul's best darling; soft, affectionate Companion of creation; thou perhaps With me created, with me too shalt die. That knowest thou alone, O God supreme, Thou whose just vengeance pour'd the wrathful doom; Whose rigours I shall straitly undergo. SCENE V. Adam. Seth. Adam. My son! return'd already! have thy pray'rs With suppliant zeal besought th'almighty God? Seth. My soul ne'er felt such fervency before; For O! my thoughts were loaded with distress, And horror dwelt within me. Adam. Hear me, Seth; Eve with her daughters,—should they here perchance Surprize us,—they would see me die. Go, haste, Tell 'em, my child, I mean this day to offer Holy sacrifice, and would be alone, Till the bright sun withdraw his chearful beams Beneath the neighb'ring mountains. Seth. No, my sire, I cannot leave thee; from my earliest days, Thou know'st with filial duty I've obey'd thee. But now to leave thee in this dreadful time, Startles imagination with ideas Fraught with strange horror.—But now thy Selima Departed from thee, overwhelmed with care, And plung'd in all the bitterness of woe. My sorrowing looks, alas! escaped her not. She wept, and wish'd to know the cause; her tears Perforce o'ercame me, and I told her all. Told her the sight these aching eyes beheld, When I observ'd thee trembling, weak, and pale, With tott'ring steps approach the sacred altar. Adam. O heav'n! and will they come!—well,—let it be; My griefs will do their work the sooner. Seth. I hear The tread of hasty steps this way approaching; And see,—'tis Selima herself. Adam. So soon! My children! O my children! O father, Most wretched of all fathers! SCENE VI. Adam, Seth, Selima. Adam. Aside.] Her countenance is sickley'd o'er with death. How pale she looks! Such was my Abel's hue When I beheld him at the altar's foot, Stretch'd wan and lifeless.—O my daughter, Why are thy looks aghast! Whence all that horror! Calm thy disturbed soul, my child. Selima. My father, If I have swerv'd from duty, nor obey'd Thy late commands, for pity's sake forgive Thy daughter. As at thy bidding, forth I went To join my mother Eve, reflecting oft On Seth's sad story; quick, as light'ning's blaze, A shock unfelt before beat at my heart; My eyes were dimm'd; 'twas darkness all around me, And all my senses seem'd at once suspended. When I awoke from this strange sleep, I found Myself, unknowing, stretch'd upon the turf. —Kind parent, chide me not; have pity rather, If my weak steps ne'er reach'd the bow'r. O sire, Comfort the mind of thy distracted Selima; Assuage her griefs.—O speak to me; shall I now Pluck freshest leaves? with filial tender care I'll strew them lightly o'er your favourite seat, Which in the summer yields you lov'd repose. I'll place it in the shade, and there refresh'd, You may behold your children gather round you. Adam. Rise, Selima, my dearest daughter, rise; Calm your distress;—but leave us now alone. I have, of import, much to talk with Seth. Our bow'r of late I noted;—it wants dressing. The straggling vine curls not its tendrils round Yon spreading elm, which asks thy gentle care. Go, my dear child, it is my favourite tree; The goodliest of the place. Go, Selima; Be comforted, my child. SCENE VII. Adam, Seth, The Angel of Death. Adam. A little while, And these fond eyes shall ne'er behold her more. Thou know'st not what I feel, my son; how sorely This deep affliction tugs at my heart-strings. She too, my Selima, that lovely flow'r, Just in its spring of days, shall wither, Reft of its bloom, and tumble into dust. Not she alone;—her children's children too Shall all return to dust like her. Thou know'st, And best of all my sons, hast comprehended, The things I told thee following my creation. Then, then I died; and all my race of children, To latest time, shall after me die also. —I shake with horror.—O grief tormenting! Distracting thought! which presses down my heart Like a vast rock. Go, go, my son, and kindly Pour comfort's balm on thy afflicted sister. For me, near Abel's altar will I dig The grave shall hold my frail mortality. Seth. No, no, my sire, I will not, cannot, leave thee; Thou shalt not dig thy grave; in his great name Who rules omnipotent, I do conjure thee, O my dear father, dig not thy own grave. Adam. Here Abel rests, and I will rest with him. Or had you rather, son, behold this body Corruption's prey, and crumbling into worms Before your eyes. Seth. O most tremendous God! To what dire proofs hast thou reserv'd us! Adam. Now, now,—horror, affright, stalk from their thrones, And compass me on all sides; I cannot Look upon thee, son; my eyes turn backward; And,—O heav'n! what dire convulsive shock Shakes all my bones and nerves together! O day Of darkness, day of horror! hear'st thou, son, The rocks from all their deep foundations tremble. —Hither he bends his way;—tow'rds us he strides;— Thou hear'st him;—hark!—the hill which near the bow'r Rises aloft, shakes terrible:—already Th'angel of death hath stopt:—thou seest him, son; Dost thou not, child? [The stage is darken'd. Seth. Encompass'd all around, With gloomy horrors and the shades of night, I nought perceive; but listen all attention. Adam. Hear me then; hear the dreadful angel. —Minister of terrors, I perceive thee now. Angel of death, exterminating angel, Behold me here. Angel of Death. O man, of earth created, Hear thy Creator's will: before the sun Shall to the forest of the cedars slope His course declining, “Thou shalt die the death.” The death which waits thy race, shall sometimes fall Like sleep upon them; sometimes be agony Distorting: for thee, thou shalt die the death. At that last moment, thou shalt surely know My near approach; o'er these same rocks my steps Shall thunder; I will shake them horrible To their foundations deep; thy faculties Of sight shall all be daz'd.—Thou shalt see nought, But the huge rock's convulsive shake, a noise, Like thunder's crash, shall burst upon thy ear, Ere the sun reach the forest of the cedars. [Angel disappears. Adam. O dreadful angel! tell th'eternal judge, My great Creator, I adore his laws, And all submissive to his holy will, In duteous awe await my final doom. But oh conjure him, for his mercy's sake, To spare me in this agony. Seth. O my father! I will die with thee; wherefore should we part? O whither goest thou? Adam. To adore my God. SCENE VIII. Seth alone. O sorrow, past all sorrows, inexpressible! O how it rends my heart, and drags it down E'en to my father's grave. O thou the first, Best of all fathers, father of all children Which on their mother's breast repose, and of Our children's children to the latest time. —But mine, alas, will ne'er behold those locks, Silver'd with reverend age; O day of death! Day of my father's death, thou comest also Precipitated thus, with all thy terrors, To prove, if with religious awe I fear, I reverence the Eternal. I'll go with Adam; With him fall prostrate at the altar's foot. This trembling hand too, if its weaken'd pow'rs Deny not the sad office, shall assist To dig his grave.—His grave! my father's grave! —Ere the sun reach the forest of the cedars.— O word of horror! dreadful pow'r of God! END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Adam. Seth. Adam. [Leaning upon the altar before his grave.] How dreadful looks this earth, my son! no more That fertile earth, which I of late beheld O'erspread with roses, or in whose deep bosom The branching cedars struck fantastic root. Here must I render up my body, I Made by the hand of God himself, to dust; I who was born not of a mortal woman! I feel the fatal moment not far off. My eyes grow dim, my arm trembles unnerv'd, My feet forget their office, and my breath Labours incessant. Death's cold hand is on me, And o'er my body, throughout all its folds, Stamps its own seal. I feel, alas! I feel, By all the heaviness about my heart, By this strange chilness which benumbs my veins, Now, now I die the death,—for 'tis no more that sleep Which locks up all the senses for a time In sweet refreshment.—Now, while I speak, Darkness falls thicker on my eyes, and horror Spreads an universal night before me. Come, come my child, or ere this world to me Shall be no more, fain, fain would I profit Of that dull glimmering light which yet remains, And cast once more my last sad looks On more extensive space than this my grave. Open the bow'r, and on that side which looks Tow'rds Eden's garden, let these eyes once more Contemplate that delightful spot; once more O let me breathe the chearful air of life. Seth. Yonder are Eden's mountains. Adam. Alas! my child, I see them not. The sun perhaps, with clouds, Is darken'd o'er. Seth. The clouds are thick; yet shade not All the sun's brightness. Adam. From the cedar's forest, Seems it far distant yet?—but tell me not, That I shall know full soon. Seth. Behold those clouds; See how he hides his beams. Adam. Alas! my son; When in meridian glory he shall shine; When he shall glow with purer radiance— —'Tis past. I never shall behold it more. Return we to the grave; there will I fix My eyes.—Lend me thy hand; support me, son. Seth. Ah, my father! Adam. [Looking towards Eden.] O ye happy plains, Ye lofty mountains, where a thousand springs Rise; and, with streams luxurious, pour down The steep declivities; ye vales eternal, With cooling shades and laughing verdure crown'd; Ye numerous plants, that, to the docil foot Of traveller, bow your low heads, and ye Who proudly thrust your summits in the skies; Ye blest delicious plains, once held so dear; Where, in such sweet tranquillity, my days Pass'd sinless; where I beheld, delighted, My children all, with thousand other beings, Throng round about me.—Garden of Eden! Seat of delights! my gushing tears, perforce, Burst forth when I remember all thy bliss. O sacred place! I will no more profane thee By these my tears. This day, this last to me, I bid a sad farewel; farewel for ever. Alas! thy fair abodes shall still preserve The trace of evils, which th'Eternal's curse On thee, on me pronounc'd.—Let us depart, My son; my feeble sight can scarce discern Distinctly ought, nor from the river's stream Knows the firm earth. Ah me, what torment then Shall inly rend my torn and bursting heart, When these sad eyes, of light entire bereft, Shall know this best of sons no more?—But see, My words appal him, and he shakes with horror; I'll strive to give him courage.—Son, my child, I fear th'approach of Selima; the sight Of her affliction were a shock indeed. Seth. Father, I will not smother ought. I saw Destruction and despair prey on my sister. Her steps at hazard rov'd; but now she sought The bow'r impatient: soon she enter'd there. Adam. Thinkst thou, from her I can conceal this state Of wretchedness? Bear I the marks of death? Appear they on my countenance? Thou turn'st Thine eyes averse. Seth. Thy words affright me, father, And wound my inmost soul. A horrid paleness Dims all thy face. I saw not Abel die; But I beheld of late, to you unknown, A child expire in life's just opening bloom. Adam. Then I shall find another of my sons With Abel. How many of my children Have died their deaths to me unknown! But tell me, Tell me, my son, of him thou sawst expire: Fear'd he the Lord Almighty? Seth. His meek soul Was spotless; upon his countenance death Impress'd no horrors; whilst a heav'nly smile, In his last moments, spake a tranquil mind. Yet, dead! alas! my eyes, aghast, turn'd from The shocking spectacle.—My sire.—Lo! Selima. Adam. Ah me! most wretched of all fathers! Sunim, My youngest born, hath disappear'd; and search, Alas, is made in vain.—Perhaps he lives not. SCENE II. Adam, Seth, Selima. Selima. Father, against your orders I return, Imploring your paternal goodness; list! O I conjure you deign to list!—A man,— His like I ne'er beheld,—prouls round the bow'r, Menaces me, and would confer with you. E'en yet I stand dismay'd—Beyond a doubt, In other regions there exists a race Of men, who're not thy children;—no, 'tis certain, This is no son of Adam. Adam. What's his air, And what his features, say! Selima. His stature's tall, Dreadful his air, and from his hollow eyes He rolls confusion and dismay; his limbs Are cover'd with a shining speckled hide; And in his hand he bears a massy club, Knotted all o'er: his face is pale and sun-burnt; But ah! his paleness is not like to yours. O father, O father! Adam. Was his forehead bare? Selima. Scarce durst I cast my fearful looks upon him; Yet on his forehead I descried a sign,— Such as I can't describe;—I know not what, Of terrible and dreadful. Adam. It is Cain; O Seth, 'tis Cain. The Lord hath sent him now, To render death more bitter to me. Go! Go Seth, and see if it be true that God Hath sent him; tell him to depart in peace. Tell him to fly my presence!—but if still He will appear before me, let him come.— 'Tis God who sends him; I have well deserv'd it. Cover the altar, that the guiltless blood Of his poor brother, whom he massacred, Wound not his eyes! SCENE III. Adam, Selima. Selima. My father, Why that pit Just dug at foot of th'altar? Adam. O my child! Didst never see a grave? Selima. A grave? my father! Adam. [Apart.] O day too bitter! Cain will soon approach, And Selima is here. Selima. O answer me! Say, is my father angry with his Selima? Alas! there was a time, wherein you deign'd To call me your dear Selima. Adam. Still most dear; Still my beloved child. Selima. You said but now, That Cain was come to render death more bitter; Alas! I scarce can breathe; my voice too fails: Ah, my dear father, mean you now to die? Adam. Grieve not, my daughter, death is due to all: From dust we came, and shall to dust return. So God himself hath order'd, and you know it. Long time before those eyes of yours, my child, Were open'd on the light, had hoary age Whiten'd my locks.—But Cain— Selima. O father, father, [Embracing his knees. By your paternal tenderness, by that Love which you once bore Abel, and which now Eman and Seth partake; by those dear babes Who shall to-day take blessings from your hand, Live, I conjure you; O, my father, live! Do not die yet. Adam. O daughter of my heart, Arise; behold them here! SCENE IV. Adam, Cain, Seth, Selima. Cain. Is't Adam that I see? Adam, thou wert not wont to turn so pale At sight of men, thy crime hath render'd wretched. Adam. Hold, I conjure thee! look on that young girl, Whose eyes o'erflow with tears: respect her grief, Nor stain with blasphemies her innocence. Cain. Her innocence! Has that remain'd on earth, Since Adam has had children? Adam. Selima, Retire; and Seth in due time shall recal you. SCENE V. Adam, Cain, Seth. Adam. Cain! Why hast thou disobey'd me? Why return'd To this abode of peace? Cain. Inform me first, Who's he has brought me now before you? Adam. Seth; My second son. Cain. Insult me not with pity! I ask for none. He is thy third son, Adam. —I am now come to take full vengeance on thee. Seth. Inhuman! Wouldst thou then, with thy own hands, Murder thy father? Cain. [To Seth.] Long e'er thou wast born, I was already wretched.—Let us talk; Father, I mean not to attempt your life. Adam. And what's the injury you would revenge? Cain. The injury of having given me life. Adam. My first born child, does that excite your vengeance? Cain. Yes,—I'll revenge the murder I committed; I'll revenge Abel's murder; he whose blood Goes up to heav'n, and cries for vengeance on me; I will revenge myself, for that I am The most unhappy of all children born; And of all such as shall be born hereafter. Sunk with the weight of guilt and misery, An outcast and a wanderer, every where I bear my steps, and find no rest on earth; Without a hope of finding it in heav'n. That, that's my cause of vengeance. Adam. Ere I first Commanded you to come no more before me, Thy mouth an hundred times hath vomited The same reproaches, which I've often answer'd. But never did your words or ravings strike So near upon my heart, as on this day, Most cruel and most dreadful of my life. Cain. I was ne'er satisfied with those your answers. But if perchance to-day, the force of truth Strikes deeper on the soul, believe not that My vengeance shall stop there.—O sole amends For all the woes I suffer, great revenge, Whose flame consumes me! Many an age I've sworn it, I'll satiate thee,—and now thy hour is come. Seth. Wretch! if thy fury has not dimm'd thy eyes, Cast but a look on those grey hairs.— Cain. And what Are they to me? I am the most unhappy Of all his children: he gave me that life Which now I drag in mis'ry, and I will Punish him home for't. Nought I see, or feel, But my own wretchedness and my despair. I will have vengeance. Adam. [To Seth.] Our dread judge hath sent him. How wilt have vengeance on me? [To Cain. Cain. I will curse thee. Adam. O son! this is too much; curse not thy father! Now in the name of mercy, and that pardon For which you still may hope, I do conjure thee, Curse not thy father Adam! Cain. I will curse thee. Adam. Come hither then, and I'll point out the place Where you may launch your malediction on me. Come, follow me!—look there!—thy father's grave! There, curse him there!—I am to die to-day: Th'angel of death appear'd to tell my fate. Cain. And what's that altar? Seth. O Cain, O most sinful And most unhappy of mankind! that altar Is Abel's altar: look upon the blood Wherewith 'tis stained: it is thy brother's blood. Cain. See!—from the bosom of the black abyss, Anger and fury raise their crests against me! —That altar; Oh! that fatal altar there, Crushes me like a rock:—where am I?—where Is Adam?—Adam, lend an ear!—My curse Begins to fall upon thee on this day; This day, thy last: Oh, may thy agony Be all made up of fear, despair, and horror; The agony of agonies!—The dread image Of vile corruption still be present.— Adam. Hold! My first-born son! O hold! appalling sentence Of death denounced! now first I comprehend Thy aweful meaning! cease, my son; Oh cease To aggravate my grief and my misfortunes. Cain. Ah wretch! What have I done!—I've shed the blood Of my own father.—Ha!—Where am I?—Who Will snatch me from this horrid place? O who Will plunge me headlong down the dark abyss? —But I behold my father.—Is it he? Is it a shadow? Is't a phantom? Oh, My father, turn those looks away.—Ah who Will drag me far, far from thee? [Excit raving. SCENE VI. Adam. Seth. Adam. His dread cries, Have struck ev'n to the bottom of my soul; Follow him, Seth. Alas! he too's my son. Go, tell him he has not committed ought Of violence against me, and his rage I pardon; above all, take special heed Not to recal it to his memory, That this day is the day wherein I die. SCENE VII. Adam. [Solus.] What is the conflict then this day I feel? My mis'ry's at its height, and I am calm. O torments, which already I've endur'd, Can you grow stronger at approach of death? If so, thou deadly calm, in thy dull sleep Wrap all my faculties, chain up my senses, And, like a victim to the altar brought, Crown'd with fresh garlands, lead me to the grave. O grave, which silence and her sister death Inhabit, like a worn-out traveller, Thou shalt receive me to thy cold dank bosom, Thence never to return.—And thou, blest soul, Soul of my child, my Abel, in this hour Wand'rest, perhaps, around thy father's grave.— If thou wert present, my beloved son, When God Almighty, in his just decree, Charg'd the dread angel to announce aloud, My hour of death: O come before my soul When it shall hover o'er my trembling lips, And these dim eyes fall sightless dark for ever. O Abel! Oh, how different thy death From mine! all bath'd in blood, thou heav'dst but thrice A parting groan, and then thy death was sleep. SCENE VIII Adam. Seth. Seth. Cain, I o'ertook, my father;—stretch'd at length I found him on the ground. As from afar He saw me, strait he rais'd his head, and cry'd Aloud, I die.—O bring me of that stream A little draught to quench the thirst that burns me. Instant I drew him water; gave it him; He drank, refresh'd:—and then I told him all As you commanded:—strait he started up, And fix'd at once his steady eyes on me: —It seem'd he would have wept, but could not; Then cry'd at length,—yes,—he is my father;— He pardons me:—well,—heav'n so pardon him. Adam. It is enough, my son. Seth. To me, my sire, Thou seemst more calm. Adam. And, trust me, so I am. Seth. The cause I know not, but within me too Tranquillity revives; say, Is it faintness? Is it a power supernatural, Which now sustains me? Adam. Let us prove, my son, If this serenity hath taken root Deep in the soul, or if its falsely flatt'ring; Answer me, Seth;—as thou returnedst hither, Didst thou behold the sun? Seth. 'Twas half o'erspread With clouds, and more than half its course it hath Perform'd already. Adam. Already! O my son, Look up;—grow the clouds light, and fade away? Comes thy dear mother here?—Agen, agen, This deadly sorrow preys upon my soul. Wretched, if I behold her looks agen; More wretched still, to see that face no more. —Shall I send for her?—Shall I shut the bow'r Against her, and preclude her from all entrance? Seth. The clouds still thicken, and my eyes as yet See not her footsteps hitherways advance. Adam. What can I do?—to thy eternal will, O pow'r supreme, who rulest the radiant sun, Who didst thyself commission thy dread angel T'announce my death, I bow all lowly; Thy will be done.—My child, my eldest born; For Cain hath curs'd me; Abel is no more; When thou shalt bow beneath the weight of age, And thy white locks be silver'd o'er by time, The children of my children, and their race, Shall gather round thee, and bespeak thee thus. Thou who didst see our father Adam die, Tell us the words which in his last sad moments Our general parent spake;—and thou, alas! Tormenting thought! shalt answer thus; on me, Just at the fatal moment of his death Leaning, all woe—begone, he cry'd.—My children, That curse, that dreadful curse which follows me, Hang's o'er ye all; and I, your father, I Have pull'd it on ye.—The just eternal pow'r, Which from the first created me immortal, Placed life and death before me, with free-will To chuse.—Fool that I was! I grasp'd at more, More than immortal sought to be, and chose Death!—But hark!—What is't I hear? the mountains Send hideous cries, and echo loud lamentings. Distress stalks o'er the vale beneath.—See, see The father.—Sight of horror, sight distracting! Buries his daughter, and the desperate mother For her own son prepares the grave;—and there Children attend their mother to the tomb.— Mark! how yon widow round the ghastly corpse Of her lov'd husband, clings disconsolate;— And see a sister, with her social tears, Bedews a brother's tomb;—and there a friend, O'er his half-self, scatters the mould'ring dust. The plighted wife, here digs the grave for him Her vows were plighted to.—O children, children, If ye behold my grave, turn not your eyes, Nor o'er my ashes, and my memory, heap Your dreadful curses:—let rememb'rance rather Of this your wretched father, let the sight Of this his grave, awaken all your pity. Will ye refuse me that, which God made man, The day spring from on high, and glad salvation To all mankind shall not refuse?—He, he Will have pity on me.—Tell them, my son, But for a blest Redeemer, I had been Crush'd with the weight of death, and in the sight Of my Creator, a mere, mere nothing. [He sits upon the altar, near the grave. Seth. See, his head droops; his eyes are closed;—alas! He dies.—O Adam, O my father, yet Breath'st thou this air. Adam. Leave me;—e'en in the midst Of death's attacks, I feel, I know not what, Of pleasing languor steal upon my soul.— Ah me, this sleep will be my last. Seth. How sudden Falls the calm sleep upon him! his eyes are Clos'd in sweet tranquillity:—let me, With pious reverence, shroud that aged head. No good old man, thou best of fathers, I Will not pour curses on thy memory.—Ha, What is't I see—The sun almost hath reach'd His course.—O sight distracting!—what's this too? My mother!—but alone she comes not ever, Her children always throng about her steps. —'Tis she,—'tis she herself;—burst, burst my heart. Crush'd down to earth with my own weight of griefs, Shall I yet feel more agonizing pain? I will retire to recollect my strength, And steel my bosom for this last dread shock. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Eve, on one side. Selima, on the other. Selima. Behold! my mother comes,—alas! my fears! I cannot bear to look upon her now. Eve. What means this solitude? this silence dread! Where is my Adam? where my duteous Seth? Where shall I find my Selima? where are they? Now let them come to share a mother's joy. O day of transport, unexpected bliss! For now I am the happiest of all mothers. SCENE II. Seth. Eve. Seth. [Without being seen by his mother.] O grief extreme, anguish ineffable, Write not your marks upon my visage now, —Ye pow'rs divine, now in this hour of need Endue my soul with more than common strength, That I may bear this shock. Eve. Behold my Seth. Oh my lov'd son, I am of mothers sure Most blest. Where, where is Adam? lead me to him. No joy, no transports, ere can equal mine. Seth. My father sleeps. Eve. Where sleeps he?—I will wake him, That I may tell him all, and share my bliss. Seth. He clos'd his eyes but now.—Oh! I conjure thee, Wake him not, mother; for some moments yet Let him enjoy the calmness of repose. Eve. No, I will haste; I'll wake him instantly.— O happiness! O transport! Seth. Good mother, Once more break not his sleep. It is not I, 'Tis Adam sues, and by his special order I do intreat it of you. Eve. Well, let it be;— His sleep will not be long, and he will wake To joys exceeding utterance. Adam, I'm sure, will soon awake.—My son, my son, I've found thy youngest brother; Sunim's found. Long time, you know, we have bewail'd his loss. Bewilder'd in the desart's pathless way, He sought in vain to reach some brother's bow'r. A miracle has sav'd his life, and 'tis A miracle hath brought him hither; but He shall tell his father all, and in his ear Pour joyful tidings.—Oh, my lov'd Sunim! Beats not his breast with quick sensations now? Does he not long to see, t'embrace his father? —But I've withheld him yet.—With the three mothers Who here conduct their infant progeny, Young blossoms of fair hopes, my Sunim comes. Then will I fill the measure of my joys, And to the nuptial bow'r conduct my Selima. Who could divine, my Sunim should return To bear the torch before you, my lov'd children. Seth. O thou most tender, most belov'd of mothers. Eve. But wherefore all these heavy looks of woe? Why mix ye not your social joys with mine? Seth. Think it not grief, but admiration, mother, Which paints my looks; a thousand diff'rent thoughts Work in my mind, and I am all amazement. Eve. See, where the mothers haste:—come, let me run; I will awaken Adam. Seth. [Apart.] Wretched Eve! You seek him there in vain. Eve. Where is he then? Where sleeps he? Seth. Near that altar,—there. Eve. By Abel's altar? Seth. Yes,—he there, himself Hath chose his place of rest:—there he will sleep. SCENE III. Eve. [Lifting up the veil before the altar.] Eve. Will not that altar wake his griefs afresh, And feed remembrance of his Abel's death? —How's this, my son? his face is cover'd.—Ha! What means that earth dug up? Has Adam sought His son's remains? Alas! that cruel sight Will wound him e'en to death. My child, my Seth! Thou answer'st not;—speak to thy mother, son.— Seth. That which thou look'st on, mother, is—a grave. Eve. Cover those bones, my child; wound not my sight With my son's bones:—alas, I cannot bear it. Seth. They are not here. Eve. Ah me! they're fall'n to dust. —Alas, my son, thy father sleeps in pain. See his breast heaves.—O God! his hands are stain'd With a wan livid hue. Seth. [Looking towards the sun.] So near already The cedar forest!—O my dear mother, I can refrain no more;—'tis Adam's grave. Behold, it is my father's grave:—before The sun hath pass'd the forest of the cedars, Adam shall surely die.—Himself hath seen Th'angel of death;—I too have heard him. —He will return, he will return, my mother, That rock shall all be rent, and then— [Eve faints at the side of the altar. [Adam wakes, and uncovers his face. Adam. O sleep! How dreadful art thou now! thou wilt be sure More soft, and less disturb'd with horrid fears, When in that grave I close these eyes for ever.— What hast thou done, my child? why hast thou brought My Selima?—Be comforted, my child, Thy mother Eve lives yet. Eve. I, I am she: If thou canst tell the accents of a voice Trembling and faint with grief, O hear me Adam; I am not Selima. Adam. O death! whose pow'r Will strike me soon;—now, now I feel indeed, Thy horrors all. Seth. [Embracing his knees.] Doest thou then die, my father? Adam. Hath the rock trembled yet? Seth. Not yet. Eve. My son, Support my steps; conduct me to thy father. —Dost thou not know me, Adam? Adam. By thy voice Thou shouldst be Eve; but these dim eyes, alas! Discern not ought of well-known feature now. Eve. Hath not the angel join'd my name with thine? Shall I not die with thee? alas! thou knowest That hope spake comfort in the days of grief, And soften'd all my anguish.—Was not I With thee created?—and must I survive Thy hour of death? abandon'd! lost! alone! Adam. Thou best, thou dearest of all wives! O thou, In this dread time, still dearer to my heart; Eve my belov'd, my part'ner from creation! These failing eyes cannot behold thee now, And only open to pour down their tears. —Leave me; thy sorrows but embitter mine, And make e'en death more insupportable. Seth. [Aside.] Heav'ns! the three mothers too!—behold them here. Adam. What noise is that? who comes this way, my son? Seth. Lo! the three mothers hither bend their steps; Eman comes with them. SCENE IV. Adam, Eve, Seth. [The three mothers, with their children; Sunim on one side, Selima and Eman on the other.] Selima. I will join them; So will I enter too.— Eve. My child, my Selima, I'll not be parted from thee; but alas! I scace believe it yet. First Mother. Come hither, Sunim. Second Mother. What is't I see? Third Mother. Is that our father Adam! Adam. Oh my lov'd Seth! Go thou before them, son. Seth [To the three Mothers.] Turn not your faces thus on me; avert Those looks;—they mar all pow'r of speech. [The first covers her face, the second turns aside, and the third leans upon her young child. The bitter sorrows I unravel now, My heart hath been acquainted with too long. Adam this day, this day shall Adam die. Before the sun shall to yon cedars slope His course declining,—he shall die. Th'angel Of death already hath he seen; agen That angel shall return; and when the rock, Which to the bow'r stands neighb'ring, shall be rent, Adam shall be no more.—There, there's his grave. —O turn, ye mothers, turn your eyes from thence; Nor look thus earnest on my father's grave. Adam. What voice is that which strikes upon my ear, Amid these groans distinguishably loud? They're not familiar sounds:—they come not From Eman's voice, nor Selima's; nor yet From any of the mothers. Seth. O my father, In thy last moments taste of comfort yet.— That voice is Sunim's voice;—thy son is found; Sunim is found. Adam. Alas! full well I know, In all my life, my Seth hath ne'er deceiv'd me; Would he deceive me in the hour of death, And cheat my senses with a gleam of joy? —My son! my dearest son, for me, alas! No more of joy remains on earth. Seth. My father! Adam. But wherefore then keeps Sunim silence now? O let me hear his voice. Seth. Excess of grief Choaks up all utt'rance. Adam. Let him come nearer, That I may lay my hands upon his hair, And feel his countenance. Seth. Thy child is here. Adam. [To Sunim, who embraces his knees.] Yes,—I perceive thee now; thou art my boy. Sunim. I am thy Sunim. Adam. Seek thy mother, child. Eve. [To Sunim.] Thy brother, rather; for alas! my son, Thou hast no mother now. Seth. O dread decree Of death pronounc'd;—leave me, my Sunim, now— I will be with thee soon.—O my father, Since hopes are now no more, and grief extreme Hath reach'd its height, I must,—I must inform thee The sun declines apace, and the tall cedars Fade on the eye:—Oh father, father, bless us. Adam. The sun already at the cedar's forest! —Come then, O death, approach; I wait thee now. —O my lov'd children, how shall I pour forth My blessings on ye? I! by whose first sin God's malediction fell on all the earth:— May your Creator bless you. All. We conjure thee, O father, bless us. Adam. Blessing is far from me; I cannot give it:—Pains unfelt before, And thousand deadly thoughts of bitter anguish, Croud on my mind:—e'en now before me rise The blest ideas of my early days, And form a contrast that o'erwhelms my soul. The thought of immortality once more Springs on my mind, and makes me shudder.—Ha! —Where am I now? 'tis darkness now no more, And sight returns agen but to behold The champain vast distain'd with reeking blood. Ye ghastly dead, look not with hideous glare On me.—I hear your cries, O blood of man! Pale murder'd man:—O dreadful, horrid blood, Change, change thy purple course, far far from me. O may the mountains hide thy stains for ever. —See, see! what mother's that? she beats her breast All frantic with despair:—her piercing cries Ascend to heav'n;—and lo, that infant child,— Death hangs upon his trembling lips: alas! It was her only child.—See mangled limbs, And there a trunkless head;—away, away, Ye fearful objects hence.—Alas, my children, With pity's soft concern behold your father, And kindly lead him from those plains of woe. Seth. O gracious heav'n, if these my trembling hands Lift up to thee, if this my bursting heart, Which shares each deadly pang, that wrings the breast Of my dear father Adam— Adam. My son, my Seth, Art thou so near me, child? I heard thy voice; —A sudden calmness overspreads my soul. Seth. Eternal pow'rs! He smiles:—Come near him all: Haste Eve and Eman, Sunim, Selima, Come all; and ye, ye mothers too, approach, And tenderly behold this smile, his last. Behold us, father, here together all Collected round thee:—O bless us, bless us! Adam. Come hither, children,—here;—where art thou Seth?— Come nearer yet, that I may gently lay My right hand upon thee; and on thy head, My faithful Eman, let me place this other: Let Selima join Eman, Sunim Seth. Come hither, mothers; bring your children here, That Eve, with me, may pour her blessings on you. [They all kneel. Eve. [Kneeling behind.] Let me, O Adam, take thy blessing too. Adam. Eve, my best half, wouldst thou, my partner dear, That I should bless thee too? Alas, 'tis all Thy Adam now has left to give thee. Thou, Mother of nations, shortly after me Created, after me shalt shortly die. Behold my grave. Eve. O Adam, my lov'd lord! Thy words I feel are now the words of heav'n. [She rises and supports Adam. Adam. I bless you all, my children; and with you, The children of your children; all mankind. May God, your father, your creator God, Who from the earth form'd man, and in that clay Breath'd an immortal soul; that aweful God, Who oft, with gracious condescension, Hath deign'd t'appear before me; who himself Hath blest me, who hath judg'd me; that dread God, The king of kings, almighty and eternal, Sweeten the bitter cup of mortal life: O may the thought of death and dissolution Serve but to waken, in the humble mind, The longings after immortality! May you so taste the blessings of this earth, As the parch'd trav'ller, at the limpid rill, Who slacks his thirst, and strait pursues his journey! May your souls rise above this earthly spot, Rich in the love of wisdom and of virtue! And may you all, with humble resignation, Learn the importance of your labours here, And reap the price hereafter! Children all Love one another, for ye all are breth'ren. And may the general good of social life Make up your study and delight on earth. May there be born amongst you men like Seth, Still to recal your sluggish minds to God; And when all-gracious God, in his due time, Shall send amongst you him who shall unlock The gates of heav'n, that holy blest Redeemer, Into whose hands I render up my spirit; With holy homage lift your eyes to God, And thank the wisdom that created you; Be humble and adore;—yet know, my children, Ye are but dust, and shall to dust return. [A noise is heard. Seth. Hark, the rock shakes! Eve. O Adam! Seth. Now agen It shakes, and every shock grows stronger. Adam. My judge, my God, behold me here!—O death, O death, I feel thee now:—I die. [The rock breaks. END OF THE THIRD AND LAST ACT.</field>
