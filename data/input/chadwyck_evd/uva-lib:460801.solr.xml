      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —Gardens of the Palace—Wings of the Palace brilliantly illuminated and a fountain in the distance—Night. Ladies and Gentlemen discovered dancing; after which enter Guards, Queen, Princess Allfair, Meliodorus, Blaze, Sugar, Tung-Long, Meer Gaum, Prince Bonbon, Baron Lowbow, Courtiers, &amp;c. Queen. Sure of all fêtes, since fêtes, were first invented, One so superb was ne'er at Court presented. Mel. Your gracious Majesty is pleased to flatter; In my land we make light of such a matter. Queen. Make light? Illuminations such a sight of, Can only, sir, in one sense be made light of. And then the concert, fireworks, and the ball, Surpassing Jullien's, Cremorne, Vauxhall— Not to say anything of the collation! Mel. Enchanted that it's met your approbation. If your fair daughter—of all belles the belle, But thought it pretty— Allf. Well, 'twas pretty well. Mel. Oh rapture! to the world the tidings tell, The Princess has pronounced it pretty well! Bear it, ye zephyrs, over hill and plain, And let the echoes bear it back again! Till every rugged rock has learned to spell, And can repeat distinctly, “pretty well!” Air—Meliodorus—“Yes! 'tis a spell.” Yes! for a spell's in ev'ry phrase That lips so sweet let fall; And “pretty well!'s” the greatest praise She ever gave at all! With gratitude my bosom glows,— Fresh hopes my heart now swell: For me Fame's trump no flourish blows Like Allfair's “pretty well!” Oh, how it would take out the shine Of many I could name, Who owe to puff and penny line The patents of their fame! Could Allfair but the critic be Of all they do or sell, What works now called “sublime” you'd see Reduced to “pretty well!” Oh, proudest day, or rather proudest night, Of my existence! if presume I might To hope this trifling proof of my affection Would move your heart gently in this direction! Allf. My heart is not inclined to move this quarter. Queen. I'm really quite astonished at you, daughter! I can't imagine, Allfair, how you can Snub such a very nice and rich young man; The King of all the Gold Mines in the earth— Impossible to say how much he's worth! Allf. For any other he might be a catch; But I'm a Princess, difficult to match. Queen. I know you are, my pet, I always said so! But, dearest child, I do want you to wed so! Allf. Why? Queen. I would see you happy. Allf. Happy? La! I'm very happy as I am, mamma. Queen. Is there not one, in all this princely train Of lovers, who may hope your heart to gain? Allf. Not one! They only waste their breath in wooing. Queen. (aside) It serves me right—it's my own foolish doing Ne'er from her cradle has she known correction, But still been taught to think herself perfection. Weakly I kissed, instead of daily cuffing her,— Ne'er blew her up, but was for ever puffing her. And now, alas! her arrogance and vanity Amount almost to something like insanity! (aloud) Shall I ne'er see thee made a joyful wife Allf. A joyful maid; I mean to pass my life In single blessedness—a matchless fair, Like chaste Diana, whose costume I wear. Mel. But even chaste Diana had her bow. Allf. A bow will bend—a husband mayn't do so. Queen. Alas! you'll bend your beaux until they break. Sugar. I would draw you for Queen of my Twelfth Cake! Allf. I should feel more obliged if you'd with-draw. Blaze. Most brilliant Princess!—gem without a flaw! As Queen of Diamonds wilt thou not be hailed? Allf. You'd best cut, Diamonds,—your suit has failed. Tung. O'er Currant Tartary decide to reign! Allf. You'll catch a Tartar if you long remain. Meer. Rajah of Jam Jellee, to you I stick! Allf. “Ohe jam satis.” Sir, of you I'm sick. Bon. Come, share my pretty box—my bonbonière. Allf. Sweet sir, I should be in the wrong box there. Bon. Your heart's a block of ice. Allf. It is, sir, one Which can't be melted by your father's son. In brief, your time away you all are throwing, So stand not on the order of your going, But go at once,—as some one said before. My lord, (to Baron) shew all these gentlemen—the door. Ensemble—“Katty did”—Polka. Allf. Bow 'em out quickly! All the whole corps! Hither they needn't Come any more! Gentlemen all, I'm yours—to the floor, As you're adorers, There is the door! Mel. and Rivals. Bow us out quickly! Shew us the door! Men of our quality Never before Treated were, certainly, With such hauteur! All her adorers Turn out o' door! Allf. If you don't hurry you'll miss the last train. Mel. Rather in yours let me remain! Allf. No; there's a terminus to that line. Mel. Then with a cord I shall terminate mine! Allf. Bow 'em out, &amp;c. Mel. and Rivals. Bow us out, &amp;c. Exeunt Lovers (shewn out by Baron) and Queen and Court, on opposite sides.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —A Chamber in the Palace. Enter Queen, disguised in a cloak and hood. Queen. Had I but died an hour before this row 'Tis ten to one I hadn't lived till now; And so should have escaped the anguish wild Of feeling I have drawn it much too mild,— And, striving but her vanity to tickle, Preserved the rod and made my child a pickle! My hints, my prayers, my tears all disregarded, Of lovers the whole pack she has discarded. But wed she shall—aye, marry shall she! though How it's to be contrived I do not know. The only soul who might hit on a plan Is the great Desert Fairy, Haridan! But to approach her is, for any stranger, A work of some considerable danger; The monstrous lions that patrol the dale Might make the British Lion e'en turn tail! Lions with two heads! on eight feet that run! And make you own two heads are worse than one. To choke 'em off the traveller must make A certain sort of sugar-candy cake, With eggs of crocodiles and millet flour, Which the said lions will with joy devour, And let the bearer pass without a scratch. Of these said cakes I lately made a batch, And, as time presses, it must be conceded, My cake has not been made before 'twas needed. Music—She goes off and returns with a covered basket containing the cakes, then exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third. —The Desert—In centre a gigantic orange tree. Music—Enter Queen with the basket on her arm. Queen. So far I've wandered o'er this desert dreary, It is no wonder I feel rather weary; Beneath this solitary tree I'll rest. Why, 'tis an orange tree, I do protest! In size surpassing any that one sees— 'Tis certainly the Prince of Orange Trees! Laden with luscious fruits that would convert The dryest desert into a dessert. Well, if my journey after all prove bootless, This friendly tree prevents its being fruitless. (plucks an orange) Amid these burning sands the sun-scorched rover Blesses kind Nature for this great chef-d'œuvre (shade over). Music—The Queen seats herself under the tree, and is about to peel the orange, when the boughs above open, and discover the Yellow Dwarf seated, eating oranges—He waves his hand—The Queen goes to sleep—The basket she has put down at the foot of the tree rises up to the Yellow Dwarf, who takes and conceals it—Hideous roars heard at a distance—The Queen wakes in a fright. —What noise was that? The lions, sure enough! Where are the cakes I brought the beasts to stuff? My basket gone! whatever have I done with it? Somebody passing by must off have run with it? Thieves! murder! I may bawl till I am hoarse! There's no policeman to be found, of course! Dwarf. Ahem! Ahem! Queen. Methought that, not far off, I heard one rather troubled with a cough. Dwarf. Ahem! Queen. (looking up) Who's there? a peeler in the tree? Dwarf. Yes, I'm an orange-peeler, as you see. Queen. To you then, as a peeler, I appeal! Some one has robbed the lions of a meal I brought for them; and my distress is great, They'll make a meal of me as sure as Fate! Dwarf. They will consider you a greater treat— They don't so often get a Queen to eat! Queen. You know my rank? Dwarf. Oh, yes; I'm a detective. Queen. Then my commands will not be ineffective. I'll give the brutes in charge. Dwarf. For what, ma'am, pray? Queen. Eating the Queen upon her own highway. So take 'em up at once. Dwarf. More than I durst; The law says I must see 'em do it first! Queen. Is that the law? Dwarf. “Thyself shall see the act.” Queen. Must I then die? Dwarf. A melancholy fact! If you've no cake, the lions give no quarter. Queen. I shouldn't mind, if t'were not for my daughter. Dwarf. Have you a daughter? Queen. Yes, an only one. Dwarf. Pretty? Queen. There's nothing like her 'neath the sun. Dwarf. I'm glad to hear it—if she's like no other; I was afraid she might be like her mother. Let's strike a bargain—come, I want a wife; Say she is mine, and I will save your life. Queen. Your wife! my daughter? Dwarf. You refuse compliance? Choose 'twixt the lions, then, and my alliance. (roars nearer) They come! Queen. Oh, mercy! Sir, Allfair is thine! Dwarf. Allfair is too fair. Madam, I decline! Queen. You'd not be guilty of such great barbarity. Dwarf. Well, then, I will accept her—out of charity. But keep your word, or you and all your kin Will suffer for it. Queen. Trust me, sir. (the trunk of the tree opens) Dwarf. Walk in! Music—The Queen enters the tree, which closes again—Two Monsters, each with two lions' heads and eight feet, cross the stage, as in pursuit of the Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth, —A Field of Nettles and Thistles—Thatched Cottage. Enter Queen. Queen. Mercy upon me! whither have I got? Into this field like rubbish I've been shot Out of the trunk, in which packed up so neatly I gave the lions the go-by completely. Though safe, with terror still my hair all bristles. What a sad waste of nettles and of thistles! A wretched hut, beside a muddy ditch,— On such a place to live in who could pitch? (Door of cottage opens, and the Yellow Dwarf appears at it) Ha! here's the owner! Owner? Goodness me! The first-floor lodger at the orange tree! Why, he's a dwarf, I vow—fit for a show! Dwarf. Mother-in-law, welcome to my château. Queen. Mother-in law! (aside) Oh, mercy! I'd forgot. Dwarf. Aye, you will be so shortly, will you not? Queen. Yes, certainly, of course. But did you say Your château? Dwarf. Well, then, my cottage ornée! Call it whate'er you please—'tis mine; and soon Your daughter here will pass her honey-moon, With her devoted husband. Queen. (aside) Husband! monkey! Dwarf. Upon these thistles she can keep a donkey To ride these lovely pleasure grounds about on, Or go a-hunting, or a-fishing out on; And in the fens and marshes, swamps, and bogs, Catch for her dinner some delicious frogs. But, what will most conduce to her delight, I shall be near her—morning, noon, and night; For 'twould distress me should her shadow be A closer follower than she'll find me. Air—Dwarf—“Der Freischutz.” Mark my words! the day you'll rue If the Yellow Dwarf unto You have told a crammer! Try upon me any trick, Down upon you I am, quick As a (yellow) hammer! But your promise keep with me, And your daughter queen will be Of this fine empire—O! Here I sing, and feast, and sport, Dancing, though my legs are short, As in Lanky-shire—O! (Lancashire clog hornpipe) Introduced specially for Mr. Robson who had made a popular feature of it in the provinces. Neither song nor dance are required in this situation and their omission, as in all cases of forced introduction would be an improvement. Queen. (aside) Oh! wretched mother! still more wretched daughter! Live here a with a vile dwarf on frogs and water. Horrible thought! who could have had a guess of it? I've been and gone and made a horrid mess of it! Dwarf. Well, madam, you are charmed, I trust? Queen. Oh, surely! But, sir, I feel particularly poorly. So faint and queer—I—wish—I was safe back again At home! (sinks on a bank) Dwarf. You shall be, madam, in a crack again. Music—The scene suddenly changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —Interior of the Palace. The bank on which the Queen had fallen changes at the same time to a couch—She remains insensible upon it. Enter Princess Allfair, in bridal attire, followed by Baron. Allf. What can this mean? It adds to my affright. My royal mother not in bed all night? Nor to be found this morning? Baron. 'Tis too true! She's gone, your Highness, no one knows where to; Which makes me fancy, one way or another, Something is up—besides your royal mother. Allf. Whatever's up, run you this instant down, And hunt for her through every court in town. Baron. Ah, madam, look! to hunt I needn't go far,— Here lies her Majesty upon the sofa! Allf. So far so good—one load is off my mind; But there's another—I can't say behind, For 'tis upon my heart. (to Queen) Mamma! Queen. (waking with a start) Who's there? Allf. 'Tis I—your daughter. Baron. The Princess Allfair. Allf. Why roll your eyes about with air so wild? Queen. Where is he? gone? and left my precious child! Allf. He—gone? Baron. She! dreams. Allf. What can she mean by “he?” Baron. Perhaps the night-mare. Allf. Pshaw! that would be “she!” Mamma, what made you wake in such a fright? Queen. What do I see? my daughter all in white? Dressed like a bride? Answer me quickly!—who, Child, are you going to be married to? Allf. Nobody, dear mamma—that is the joke! I found myself so dressed when I awoke. Queen. (aside) Joke! Oh, poor victim! there is no joke in it,— He will be here to fetch her in a minute. Baron. Perhaps your Majesty can solve the mystery. Queen. (aside) Alas, too well! But, oh! the horrid history I dare not tell her. Allf. What's the strangest thing, Upon my wedding-finger there's a ring, Made of red hair; and vain is force or skill, It won't come off. Queen. (aside) Which means the wedding will! Allf. I think it may be as a trick regarded, Played by some lover whom I have discarded;— One of the pack whom I last night sent packing. Queen. (aside) Ah! just as I my wretched brain was racking For some quick means of 'scaping this disaster, Her words have for my wound supplied a plaster! (aloud) Say, have your lovers all left in despair? Allf. I really don't know, and, what's more, don't care. Queen. “Don't care” came to be hanged—and you'll be finding A knot as fatal, if you keep not minding! (to Baron) Fly! stop their Majesties and Royal Highnesses, And tell 'em not to pack up all their finesses Until they have a message from the Queen! (Exit Baron) Allf. Good gracious, dear mamma! what can you mean? Is't possible that any one can view Anything wrong that I could say or do? Queen. Question me not! but lend your serious hearing To what I shall unfold. That's not a mere ring Of hair you wear. No; you are in a scrape From which there is but a hair-breadth escape To be hoped for. Sure as I am your mother, Out of that ring you must get through another. You have of lovers, luckily, a score; Marry but one of them—I ask no more. Allf. Marry but one of them? Well, to please you, I promise that I will not marry two! Queen. You can't—the law won't let you—there's no doubt of it, And that's the very way you will get out of it! Allf. Get out of what? Queen. Daughter, I'll tell you when You're married. (Exit Queen) Allf. You will never tell me then. I married! I e'er condescend to say To living man that I will him “obey?” I, who am faultless, both in form and mind? Indeed I shall do nothing of the kind! If any suitor could have suited me, The young King of the Gold Mines had been he; Not for his gold—if he had not a pennyweight, With me that circumstance would not have any weight— I'd take him in his skin, without a tanner. How silly to be talking in this manner About a man at all—folks would suppose I was in love with him: I'm not, heav'n knows! And even if I were—Pooh! nonsense! stuff! I won't wed anybody—that's enough! Unless the donor of this dress can hit Upon a body just as good a fit Air—Allfair—“Son Virgin.” I woke from a doze, ah! This morning, and rose, ah! In these fine new clothes, ah! By some one supplied; But who, goodness knows, ah! I can but suppose, ah! 'Tis the work of some fairies, Whose project so rare is To make me a bride: But if such their care is, This habit to wear is Absurd, unless there is A bridegroom beside. Yes, surely those who dressed me as a bride Are bound to find a groom for me beside. Yellow Dwarf rises through trap. Dwarf. (aside) And here he is beside you, my proud fair! Allf. (turning and seeing him) Ugh, lud! what horrid little monster's there? Who let you in? and what d'ye come to do? Dwarf. I come to make a morning call on you. Allf. On me? a morning call? Supreme audacity! Will you inform me, pray, in what capacity? Dwarf. Your most obedient servant to command. Allf. (aside) Servant? Oh! now I think I understand; A dwarf, to entertain me, sent by some one. Well, he's undoubtedly a very rum one, But he's too ugly, really, to be pleasant. (aloud) To whom am I indebted for the present? Dwarf. Her Majesty. Allf. The Queen? she made no mention Of such a gift. Dwarf. No doubt 'twas her intention Agreeably to surprise you. But come, say,— For I'm impatient,—name the happy day. Allf. What happy day? Dwarf. Our wedding-day. What other Could you think happier? Your royal mother Has given her consent—so it's all right; We can be tied up, if you please, to-night. Allf. Tied up? I'll have you tied up pretty soon. Presumptuous pigmy! insolent buffoon! What ho! my guards! within there, and without there! Dwarf. Thou but offend'st thy lungs so loud to shout there; Not one can move or stir until I choose; Look to your own hand ere you mine refuse. Oh, it's no use to frown, and fume, and fidget. What have you got upon your wedding digit? Just place that ring these golden ringlets near, And see if that hair doesn't match this here. Allf. Horrible fact! there cannot be a doubt, From that small bunch of carrots 'twas pulled out! Dwarf. Answer me next: Whence came your wedding trousseau? That dress, that might astonish Madame Tussaud? There's nothing finer in her room to view. Allf. Nor in her chamber, horror like to you! My mother ever call her son-in-law you? I'll bet her crown my mother never saw you! Dwarf. You'd lose it! I've her licence, you've my ring! Allf. I don't believe you then—it's no such thing! And so, you little ugly brute, get out! Dwarf. Brimstone and treacle! mind what you're about. Like it or lump it, you're engaged to me! Allf. But I won't have you! Dwarf. Won't you? we shall see! Allf. I'll go and pull this dress off, to begin. Dwarf. You can't! 'twill only come off with your skin. 'Twas ordered for your wedding, and was made By the first hands in all the fairy trade. They warrant it to wear, and you must wear it; Off you can't pull, or cut, or burn, or tear it: Your ladies' maids may take their solemn oaths Till you're a bride no more of cast-off clothes! Allf. A woman live in one dress all her life? Dwarf. Yours won't be long, unless you are my wife. Make up your mind to pass your life with me, Or yours will be as short, in short, as me. (sinks through trap) Allf. What's to be done? was ever such enormity? Betrothed to such a monster of deformity! I must be dreaming, or I am delirious! And yet why was my mother so mysterious? Why ring such changes upon wedding rings? Why rush to railways after turned-out kings? Why ask if “he” were gone, with rolling eyes? Why?—why?—oh, why? if it were otherwise? She comes. Re-enter Queen with Baron. Mamma, what have you done? explain! Queen. Brought all who courted you to Court again, In hopes a husband out of them you'll pick, And marry him directly. Allf. Answer—quick! Had you not promised me to one before? Queen. Humph! Allf. Don't say “humph!” or say it and no more, For that's enough; and on the hip I catch you. Queen. Oh, you don't mean he has been here to fetch you? Allf. He was to come here, then? and you—you knew it? Queen. Indeed—indeed, I didn't go to do it! To save my life he made me make a vow,— I'll tell you all about it, but not now. Marry at once some Prince who can protect you, And then the Dwarf to wed him can't expect you; He knows the law will not allow polygamy, And, little as he is, 'twould still be bigamy. Allf. Ah me! I feel 'tis no use hesitating. Queen. (to Baron) Admit the royal gentlemen in waiting. (Exit Baron) Allf. If I must marry, it shall be at least A handsome man, and not an ugly beast. Music—Re-enter Baron with Meliodorus, Blaze, Sugar, Tung-Long, Meer Gaum, and Bonbon. Mel. One sentence from your lips to hear we run, By which we all shall be sent hence but one. Oh, name that one! Omnes. We all implore, in chorus! Allf. The King, then, of the Gold Mines— Meliodorus! Mel. Oh, rapture! Blaze. Madness! Sugar. Fury! Tung. Rage! Meer. Distraction! Bon. (to Meliodorus) Sir, you will have to give me satisfaction. Mel. Oh, sir, the satisfaction will be mine. Bon. Diable! then, to spite you, I decline. Mel. Just as you please. Can I do anything In that way, pray, for any Prince or King? To prove my title to so great a treasure I should be proud with all my sword to measure. Blaze. Diamond cuts diamond only. Sugar. I would fight, But cannot draw except upon Twelfth Night. Tung. I can, but won't—a candid Khan I am. Meer. Self-preservation is the law of Jam. Allf. In fact they all fight shy; but understand, Some one may yet appear to claim my hand By whom your courage will perchance be tried, So pause before to take it you decide. Mel. Pause? talk of pause with such a hand in view? I fain would see who dare lay paws on you! Without more ceremony thus I seize— Allf. Nay, one more ceremony if you please. Queen. For which all's ready—parson, licence, ring. Mel. Madam, you make me happier than a king. Let's to the parson, love, this instant go. Allf. I'm not the parson now, sir, to say “no.” Bridal March—Mendelssohn. Mel. Strike up the Bridal March in most stunning style! Let every brick among you fling up his tile? Rivals. Off let us quickly march; nor see this young file Hand off her Highness in this off-handed style! Mel. and Allf. Set all the bells a ringing Merry peals to tell, How happy Meliodorus Goes to ring the belle! Strike up, &amp;c. Rivals. Our hearts, alas! 'tis wringing, More than we can tell, To see King Meliodorus Bear away the belle! Off let us, &amp;c. (they form in procession—as they are about to leave, Haridan appears, followed by a brazen coffer drawn by two large turkey-cocks) Mel. What's here? a strange old woman with a box! Allf. Drawn by a pair of goblin turkey-cocks. Queen. What can she want? Mel. Speak, if you've aught to say; If not, your carriage, madam, stops the way. Haridan, leaving the coffer and turkey-cocks in the centre, walks round the stage, examining the company, without speaking. Allf. No answer? Queen. Sure she's dumb. Mel. A silent woman! A person most remarkably uncommon. Allf. Who can she be? Queen. (aside) I'm half afraid to guess. Har. (who has suddenly stopped in the centre of the stage, brandishing her crutch) Aha, my Queen—oho, my fine Princess! Is this the way you keep your word at Court? Think you to make the Yellow Dwarf your sport? Mel. The Yellow Dwarf?—who's he, when he's at home? Har. One who your scented periwig will comb Unless you brush with it, you may depend. I am his old and very faithful friend, The Desert Fairy! Queen. Ha! Mel. Why from her shrink so? Queen. (aside) Mercy preserve me! if I didn't think so, Har. (to Queen) Is this your gratitude, for having packed you Safe in a trunk when my coast-guard attacked you? Without his orange tree, ungrateful Queen, Where, by this time, d'ye think you would have been? Where it might not be delicate to say,— But down Red Lion Street a precious way! Did you not swear, if he would save your life, Your proud young daughter there should be his wife? And now, the peril past and you in clover, You'd coolly throw your life-preserver over! Such pranks are not in Fairy-land permitted, The debt you owe the Dwarf must be acquitted. I came to see all fair—and I will see Allfair his bride, as she is bound to be. Aye, by my hood I swear she shall be such, Or in my kitchen fire I'll burn my crutch! Mel. (to Queen) Did you so swear? Refute the allegation. Queen. I took an oath under intimidation, Therefore it can't be binding. Allf. Let her storm; I didn't promise, and I won't perform. Har. You're not of age, so that plea falls to ground— The daughter by her mother's act is bound, Mel. Bound or unbound, vile hag, you'd better quick Out of this palace cut your wicked stick; For, if you give us much more of this jargon, I'll burn your crutch, and you into the bargain. Music—He advances on her—Thunder and lightning—The lid of the brazen coffer flies up with a tremendous clang, and the Dwarf appears seated on a great cat. Dwarf. (advancing) Rash boy! insult not this illustrious fay— It is with me you'll square accounts to-day. I am your rival, and your deadly foe, The Yellow Dwarf. Mel. They may well call you so. As Byron says, “I never, no, I never Saw any man so yellow. How's your liver?” Dwarf. You'll find I'm not white-livered, to your cost. Resign that lady's hand, or you are lost: She is my bride—by her own mother there I was contracted to Princess Allfair. Mel. Something's contracted you, that's pretty plain: If I were you I'd get drawn out again. Dwarf. Madam, (to Allfair) by you is this base fraud defended? To save your mother's life I condescended To be your yoke-fellow. Mel. Yoke-fellow? nay, Her yolk-of-egg fellow, you mean to say. Allf. You talk of fraud, who plays such juggling tricks On travellers when they are in a fix? Har. He tricked her not; but at her utmost need He took her in— Queen. Ah, that he did, indeed! Dwarf. And there I was in fault, I must agree. I ope'd the door of the old orange tree, And let into its parlour neat and tidy A traveller who wasn't bonâ fide! Mel. No more of this. If you would 'scape with life, Vacate the building. Dwarf. Not without my wife. She has my ring upon her finger fair,— Those are my orange blossoms in her hair. Try to pluck off that ring, or one small flower, Then say if you've the pluck to brave my power. Mel. Thus do I answer! (makes a blow at the Dwarf) Har. Nay then—one—two—three! Off with the girl, and leave the boy to me. Music—As she speaks she strikes the King's sword from his hand with her crutch, and he becomes fixed to the ground— She touches Allfair with it, who falls insensible into the arms of the Dwarf, and, waving it in the air, the stage becomes dark, the sun turns red as blood, a thick mist descends and envelopes all the characters, during which the Dwarf disappears with Allfair, and Haridan with Meliodorus—The mist then disperses gradually, and discovers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Sixth. —The Steel Castle of the Yellow Dwarf and Enchanted Gardens—Allfair, still insensible, is reclining on a couch of flowers, and the Yellow Dwarf is standing at her side, gazing upon her. Dwarf. “Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,” Has most completely sewed up fair Allfair; Tacked her sweet lips together, and pretended To darn a pair of eyes that can't be mended. So much their brilliancy my soul bewitches, I am afraid to cut those careful stitches And blink again before the fiery flashes Which have almost reduced my heart to ashes. What, shall this heart—a marble to a foeman— Now knuckle down at ring-taw with a woman? No; far gone as I own it is, with shame, I'll see it further ere I lose the game. Let strains as magical as those of Orpheus Gently release her from the arms of Morpheus. How happy that chap Morpheus must be. Would that I were Morpheus, and Morpheus me! Then he would be a dwarf, deformed and yellow, And I should be a much more downy fellow. (music) Allf. (waking) “What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?” Dwarf. I am that angel. Allf. (starting at sight of him) Angel? Had'st thou said Quite the reverse, the fact I might not question. Dwarf. I understand the delicate suggestion; But with that gentleman if you're acquainted, You'll own I'm not so black as he is painted. Allf. To colour o'er thy deeds thou can'st not hope. Dwarf. (aside) I'll try how I am off for yellow soap. (aloud) Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, To give the Dwarf leave to be his own showman. Allf. Vouchsafe, deformed infection of an elf, To take thy leave and go and hang thyself. Dwarf. By such despair I should myself accuse. Allf. Didst thou not kill the king I chose to choose? Dwarf. I'm not aware of it: but put the case, I only sent him to a better place. Allf. Thou art unfit for any place but one, That I could name— Dwarf. Don't—it is never done To ears polite. But say I did the act; You an accomplice were, before the fact. Allf. You'll have some pains to prove that, I suspect. Dwarf. Thy beauty was the cause of that effect. Allf. If I thought so, I'd spoil it in a trice. Dwarf. I couldn't let you, ma'am, at any price. To scratch those cheeks would be a crime most scrubby. He who bereft thee, lady, of thy hubby, Did it to help thee to a spouse more proper. Allf. Where is he? Dwarf. Here. Allf. Well, if that ain't a whopper I never heard one, and shan't while I live. Dwarf. If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword, And humbly beg my death. (kneeling) Allf. (taking the sword) Upon your word? Dwarf. Aye; do not pause I cribbed your mother's cake, But then I stole it only for your sake. (Allfair gives him a poke with the sword, but it does not pierce him) Go it again! I floored King Meliodorus, But 'twas your face made me so indecorus. (she gives him another poke, without effect, and then flings the sword down) Why drop the sword? Allf. The deuce is in his luck,— I try to stick him and he won't be stuck. Dwarf. Take up the sword again, or take up me. Allf. You are much sharper than your sword, I see. What is the reason through I haven't thrusted you? Dwarf. (rising) Because you can't—or I should not have trusted you. You don't think such a fool I could have been? I'm jolly yellow, but not jolly green. This sword a fairy for my father made; No cutler ever knew so keen a blade; A better tempered weapon cannot be,— It makes a point of never hurting me! With plates of the same steel I've faced yon walls, Which, by a magic light that on them falls, Like burning glasses can reduce to tinder The ragamuffin whose approach I'd hinder. Once in these groves you cannot leave 'em; so If you attempt it, you'll find it's no go. Then make your mind up like a girl of sense, And marry me at once. Allf. On no pretence. Dwarf. I will surround you with all pomps and joys, And thou wilt have no end of yellow boys. Allf. Go, get along to Old Virginny—do, And find some yellow girl to marry you; To Meliodorus I'll be true for ever. Dwarf. (aside) That name gives me a fit of yellow fever. Ha! could I make her fancy him untrue, I might give her the yellow fever too; I'll try a spell that ne'er to fail was known, And raise some spirits that may raise my own. (aloud) What if your Meliodorus should deceive you? Allf. Though you should swear it, I would not believe you. Dwarf. He has done so. Allf. You jest! Dwarf. I'm not so jocular. Allf. Give me some proof he has. Dwarf. You shall have ocular. Music—He waves his hand—The trees open, and discover the form of the King of the Gold Mines kneeling at the feet of a beautiful Nymph. Behold your faithless lover on his knees To something like a beauty, if you please! Allf. Start eyes! stern creditors, from out your sockets, And strike against my bankrupt heart your dockets. But no! I doubt this proof, though 'tis autoptical! Such base delusion can be only optical; Some wicked trick contrived my mind to trouble,— Some juggling stereoscope that shews his double. Dwarf. Right, but you know that stereoscopic cases Are made to shew up folks with double faces. She is so much more beautiful than you, You cannot doubt. Allf. Oh, now I see 'tis true! For the gay bold-faced baggage smiles on me, And points at him for hers! Dwarf. (aside) It works, I see— With yellow she's completely overcast, To this complexion she has come at last. (he waves his hand—Tableau disappears) Allf. Gone? Let this hour be henceforth marked with black, And stand accursed in the almanack! Oh, give me death by anything but slow means. Dwarf. But you are satisfied? Allf. No—not by no means. Dwarf. Take vengeance on him by rewarding me. Allf. That would be with a vengeance—certainly. No, though he's treated me so very sadly, I'm not a going to behave so badly. Dwarf. Ha! Flour of sulphur! what prevents my taking you At your own word, and an example making you Of all who would the Yellow Dwarf defy? Answer me. Allf. I don't know. Dwarf. No more do I. My head spins like a top—my sight grows hazy! 'Twixt love and rage this girl will drive me crazy! Duet—Dwarf and Allfair—“Norma.” Dwarf. In my power at last I hold you, Just exactly as I told you. You must wed me. Allf. No, I shan't, sir! Dwarf. But I'll make you. Allf. You can't, sir! Hear me! Spite of all we've seen before us, Here I swear that I will never Marry any, save Meliodorus! So to make me you'd be clever. Dwarf. This the last time is of asking— You'll repent it if you refuse me. Allf. All your power it would be tasking, Still more cruelly to use me. I defy you—I detest you! This true heart you cannot shake! Dwarf. In my bank then I invest you, Till more interest I can make. At a sign from the Dwarf the bank of roses on which Allfair was discovered at the opening of the scene, changes into a rock and encloses her—The scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Seventh. —A Cavern on the Sea Shore. Enter Haridan. Har. To ask a question which itself explains, “What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?” It means, alas! that I, great Haridan, Who for five hundred years have hated man, Have fallen into a trap by Cupid baited, And am by my own captive captivated. Yes, that sly knave of hearts has gone and sold mine To that too handsome King of every Gold Mine. The instant his sweet phiz I clapped my eyes on They drank in a full cup of—not “cold pison,” And I determined off at once to carry him, And here, by my own special licence, marry him. But though I've got him safe 'neath lock and key, The job is now to make him marry me. I've tried to frighten him—which surely you Would say the sight of me's enough to do: But no,—nor look nor menace can alarm him; I must by greater charms essay to charm him. My friend the Dwarf upon my rival Allfair Has just now played a trick she mightn't call fair! But which, I think, is all fair in fair time, And it has given me a hint sublime. I'll turn his tableau into a reality, And be the belle of that beau-ideality. Music—She changes to the Beauty in the vision of the previous scene. After five hundred years, it's hard and strange One's face and habits all at once to change. “De gustibus non disputandum est;” But I prefer my old ones, I protest. Though there be harridans I know in plenty Would give the world to make themselves look twenty; And use as much paint as would fill a cart, To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art. Now on my prisoner to try my spell; (waves her hand) This is for him another sort of sell. Music—The rock opens and discovers Meliodorus chained in a hole of it. (feigning surprise) What do I see? King Meliodorus here? Mel. A fine young woman! How d'ye do, my dear? Har. I'm pretty well, I thank you. How are you, sir? Mel. Oh, bored to death by a vile old Medusa. Har. (aside) The monster! Mel. But pray tell me, who are you Who seem to know me, and to look me through? Har. A nymph—the owner of a neighbouring grotto. Mel. A fairer one was never drawn by Watteau! With face so lovely and with form so airy— Har. You could love me, then, though you can't the Fairy? Mel. Oh, couldn't I? Har. And will you? Mel. No, I won't. Har. Dost mock me, cruel monarch? Mel. No, I don't; But my affections were engaged before, Or you're the sort of girl I could adore. Har. You could? Then do, and I will ever stay with you; Or, if you would prefer it, run away with you. I fear you think me bold. Mel. No; I might say A little fast—if you would run away. But chained as I am to this rocky shelf, I am too much a fast young man myself. Har. Love me, and I will change each horrid fetter To links of roses, which would look much better. I am a spirit of no common sort; A slap-up brougham and pair you'll find I sport; I have a brilliant bow'r in Belgrave Square, In every first-rate company a share, A free admission to all sorts of sights, An opera-box alternate Thursday nights On the grand tier—a stall to see the ballets, A season ticket for the Crystal Palace. No bill shall bother you—no business bore, No nothing never trouble you no more. Mel. I'm very sorry, but you must excuse me. Har. Have you the heart, barbarian, to refuse me? Mel. (aside) I'm of a nature not at all suspicious, But in her eye there's something rather vicious. Har. (aside) My rage to smother I am scarcely able. Mel. (aside) I look down towards her feet,—but that's a fable! No, 'tisn't—there they are—a frightful pair! Har. (aside) At what on earth does the young villain stare? Confusion! all my hopes a fatal blow to! My transformation wasn't made in toto! I quite forgot in those infernal laws About my feet there is some horrid clause. But though I couldn't change their shape or skin, I might have found “que'que chose” to put 'em in. Mel. To catch me this is some perfidious plan. If not Old Harry, you're old Harridan! Har. Well, you are right—the latter one of them it is, Whom love has driven to these strange extremities! Mel. (aside) By rating her, her wrath I shall but waken; A little gammon yet may save my bacon. (aloud) Madam, I own appearances are more In favour of you than they were before; Your beauty now is absolute perfection. Give me a little more time for reflection: And, what would give me much more satisfaction, A little greater liberty of action. I must, if I'm to make another match meant, Get over this unfortunate attachment. My feelings then might undergo revulsion— No mortal man can love upon compulsion. Har. If I could hope to warm that heart so icy— Mel. Well, now you've made yourself to look so spicy, If I were free—Egad! I wouldn't swear. Har. Well, as an earnest of my favour—there! Music—His chains fall off, and the back of the cavern opens, discovering the ocean. Go, take a turn on my Marine Parade; Of your escape I'm not the least afraid: No craft of any sort in sight can heave, Much less approach the shore without my leave, So wild I've made the sea about these caves, Even Britannia couldn't rule the waves! Mel. My gratitude at least for this is owing. Har. Farewell! (Exit) Mel. Farewell—and thank you much for—going. Oh, all ye ocean gods and little fishes That ever swam in brine or smoked in dishes!— Pity the sorrows of a poor land lubber Who more than any whale has cause for blubber; Whose anguish no cod-liver oil can cure! Who flounders in a net he can't endure; Whose soul's so sad, he wishes he were dead As any herring that was ever red; In brief, whose misery is metaphorical In every sense that can be piscatorical! If you've of Justice but a single scale, If there's among ye one who with a tale Like mine, to pity I've the power to move— If ever oyster yet were crossed in love, Let but that native to my rescue rise, Nor here in vain hear me apostrophize! Song—Meliodorus. Air—“The Red, White, and Blue.”) O Britannia, the pride of the ocean, Who slaves to make every one free, Won't you second a poor fellow's motion, And save him from felo-de-se? You, the Blacks who have emancipated, (And a fine lot of browns it cost too!) Can't see a man so sitivated, Let his colour be red, white, or blue. Though the waves on this coast some may deem, ma'am, For even your ruling too great, I believe if you'd get up your steam, ma'am, You'd soon rule 'em remarkably straight. Could I but some of your jolly Jacks see, Who are longing for something to do, 'Stead of looking so black in the Black Sea They might help a poor wight o'er the blue. There's something coming now indeed to pass! A lady—with a comb and looking-glass! Music—Syrena appears in the water. Duet—Syrena and Meliodorus—“Oberon.” Syren. Moved by all the salt tears you have shed, I turned out of my coral bed, And to the surface of ocean fair Came without staying to comb my hair; So I must beg that excuse you will My calling upon you en déshabille; And while in ev'ry sad key you sing, Permit me my dripping locks to wring. Mel. No apology, pray, to me; I'm too happy a friend to see. If an excuse you could need, fair lass, You'll find one, I'm sure, in your looking-glass. One so form'd to enchant each eye, On no other form need stand, sure-ly. So unfold to a captive King The name you bear, and the tale you bring. Syren. My name, sir, is Syrena—I'm a mermaid; You know Queen Amphitrite, I am her maid Of honour. She has yielded to your wish, Expressed in sounds that frightened all the fish; I come to offer you a passage free To the Dwarf's Castle, where Allfair you'll see. Mel. A tempting offer if your story's true. It seems all fair above board, miss, with you; But if beneath it you're another cheat— Excuse me if I ask to see your feet. Syren. I have no feet; but here's at least a foot Of what I wear by way of substitute; I came to serve you as a faithful friend, And promise you I have no other end. Mel. Forgive me, pray; this final explanation Puts to my doubts a perfect termination. Yet to go with you I am half afraid, I am a mere man—you are a mermaid: And I have read, in books the most instructive, That syrens are uncommonly seductive. Syren. I wouldn't so much wrong your Princess sweet. I'm a mermaid of honour, I repeat. Take this enchanted sword—its brilliant blade Is of a single yellow diamond made; Your dwarfish rival has a skin so tough, No weapon save this one, can pink his buff. Stick to your point with this—you need care none for, But mark—if once you drop it you are done for! Come, time is precious—jump up! Mel. Jump up—where? Syren. Why here, of course, and hold fast by my hair. Mel. I'm quite ashamed! (steps on the end of her tail) Syren. Pshaw! say when you are ready. Are you all right behind? Mel. Yes; go on—steady! (music—Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Eighth. —Another part of the Enchanted Groves (Dwarf's Castle)—Moonlight. Enter Dwarf Dwarf. Of ugly news here is a pretty batch, By submarine electric eel dispatch, From our own correspondent to receive! King Meliodorus absent without leave, And in possession of the diamond sword, By which alone I can be floored or bored! But is it true? for one may doubt the half At least, of what we hear by telegraph. Electric eels are famed for tails that shock one, They're slippery bodies who delight to mock one; Official tidings will but come to hand By the bi-monthly fairy overland, And it will never do for that to wait,— The foe may be already at my gate. My plated fort defies a common storm, But that would make it for me much too warm! The diamond sword dissolves the burning steel. Already on hot plates myself I feel. At magic I must take a precious spell, Or I shall go to—where I mustn't tell! Air and Chorus—Dwarf and Demons—“Robert le Diable.” Recitative. Dwarf. I must sing something queer,— A la mode de Meyerbeer! Air. Holloa, ho, there! below there! You infernal crew, Your talons come shew— There's a job here to do! Demons. (without) Oho, oho! is there so? Dwarf. There's a chap here, coming slap here, The deuce who will play, Unless a man-trap here For him we can lay. Demons. Oho, oho! is there so? Enter Demons. Dwarf. To face the foe, disguise your fiendish features, And come out strong, like devilish handsome creatures; Sly as a weasel, here I'll wait to pop Out on him, if the sword you make him drop. (music—they retire) Enter Meliodorus. Mel. So far I've made my way with perfect ease, Through groups of very civil orange trees, That with their lowest boughs my sword saluted, And seemed in admiration of it rooted; Their nodding fruit the cheering hope conveyed, That I might count upon their orange aid. Music—Enter Nymphs with garlands, who group themselves so as to intercept him. Soft! what are these? so light and full of mirth They look not like the inhabitants of earth And yet dance on it, in my path thus skipping? Amongst them it won't do to be caught tripping. By your leaves, ladies— (tries to pass their garland) (they invite him to dance) Choose a partner? No. (two take hold of each arm) Nay, then, I must cast off two couple—so, And down the middle— (they bar his progress en masse) (to the foremost) Back, you foolish flirt, you! Upon my honour you will make me hurt you. Syren. (within) Strike, or you'll not find Allfair! Mel. Not find Allfair? Then take the consequences, short or tall fair! (he attacks them—They vanish, and Demons appear in their place) Ha, my fine fellows! foul of you I'll fall; Come, cut and long-tail,—Bucks, have at ye all! (he attacks and disperses them) Enter Allfair. Mel. Ha! (starting) Allf. Oh! (starting) Mel. (advancing) Yes! Allf. (retreating) No! Mel. (advancing) 'Tis she! Allf. (about to fly) 'Tis he! Mel. (stopping her) Yes, me! Toujours fideèle! Allf. Toujours fiddle-de-dee! (indignantly) Mel. What means my love by playing on that fiddle, As if she thought I told a tarradiddle? Allf. And have you not a tarradiddle told? Did not these very eyes that form behold In form proposing to a brazen belle, To whom you told your love, and tolled my knell? Mel. Never! it was a piece of hocus-pocus Of that vile Dwarf, as yellow as a crocus; I swear it, whilst upon my knees I low drop, And kiss that hand as white as any snowdrop! Music—Kneeling down and seizing her hand he drops his sword—The Dwarf, who has been on the watch, rushes forward and seizes it. Allf. The Dwarf! Mel. The devil! Dwarf. The diamond sword I hold. Allf. Spare him! Dwarf. No, not for all his mines of gold, Unless upon the instant you consent To be my wife, and give up this young gent. Mel. Oh, rather let the fiend encore my death A thousand times! Allf. It takes away my breath To think of such a solo. Rather let Our lives together end in a duet! Duet—Meliodorus and Allfair—“Favorita.” Some woes can't be uttered in words, Unless airs they are set to, that I know. When lovers are down on their lucks, On such notes 'tis delightful to dwell. Must swans be the only fine birds Who to music, to music can die? No! We'll prove that two dear little ducks Can to melody waddle off equally well! Dwarf. I'll hear no more! this blade cuts short the parley, And thus brings your duet to a finale! (stabs Meliodorus) For this among the rest did I engage. Mel. (falling) Oh, and for much more murder—on this stage, If you're allowed to act this part by me! Allfair, farewell! “Bon soir la compagnie!” (dies) Allf. Gone? dead and gone? Don't think to leave me so. My life—my husband! (snatching sword from Dwarf and stabbing herself) I come for to go! (falls and dies) Dwarf. Allfair also? Oh, here's a precious go! Music—Enter Haridan. Har. Monster, what means this tragical tableau? You've killed the little King on whom I doted. Dwarf. And caused her death to whom I was devoted. Oh heavy trial! Verdict—Serves me right! Whip me ye devils—winds come, blow me tight! Roast me in flames of sulphur—very slow! Oh Allfair—Allfair!—Dead—O, O, O, O! Har. Sweet Prince, that thy sad shade may wander never, Become a palm, and flourish here for ever! Dwarf. Your troubled spirit, dear Princess, to calm, Rise hand in hand with him—that's palm to palm. Music—Two Palm Trees rise in front of the bodies and a fountain between them. Har. What's springing up between them—a fine fountain? Dwarf. Something's in this on which I wasn't counting. Har. Something indeed! a mermaid in fresh water! Dwarf. So far out of the sea what can have brought her? Syren. (who has risen in the fountain) Necessity, which knows no law aquatic, Upon the stage to alter laws dramatic. Though palm to palm like holy palmers kiss, D'ye think upon the house to palm off this? Because the story ends so in a book, Are dramatists no further, pray, to look? A tale of mirth to close at such a season On two dull trees would be the dullest treason; Though Madame D'Aulnoy brings the pair to grief, We'll make these palms turn over a new leaf; And if the town take interest in their fate, Restore them to a much more palmy state. Music—The scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Ninth. —Throne Room in the Palace of Meliodorus in the Royal Gold Mine. Meliodorus and Allfair re-appear as the Palms descend, surrounded by the Queen and Court, all the other Kings, Princes, &amp;c. Mel. (to Audience) Restored to form and throne, happy and glorious, 'Tis you alone can make me here victorious. Join all your palms that I may long behold mine, And make this house, for the lessee, a gold mine. Finale—“The old friends at home.” Mel. Let other miners seek the diggins Far, far away— Here on this minor stage of Wigan's I'm more inclined to stay. From the realms I now behold mine No more bid me roam, But make this house a little gold mine, And for your old friends a home. Allf. How far am I from perfect, sadly I feel to-day; And fear Allfair would fare but badly But for your kind hearts' stay. All the world in search of pleasure At this season roam; Here bring, to pass a little leisure, All of your young friends at home. Moral—“Villikins and his Dinah.” A song in Henry Mayhew's farce of “The Wandering Minstrels,” which Robson had previously made exceedingly popular by the dramatic power he threw into it. Dwarf. The moral, like me, is so uncommon small, I might almost say there's not no moral at all,— But that pretty young girls should beware of sly elves, And not be so werry much “nuts” on themselves. Singing, Too ral, lal loo ral, &amp;c. Now all you young folks who are home for the holidays, And children of all growths who hate melancholy days, Come add to the number of Allfair's adorers, And join every night in the popular chorus Of—Too ral, lal loo ral, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
