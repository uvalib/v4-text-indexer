      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The open country. A public road at one side, and near it a chÃ¢teau. The sound of a hunt is heard from within. The Infante DON ENRIQUE enters tottering, and falls upon the stage. A little after, DON ARIAS and DON DIEGO enter; and last of all, the King DON PEDRO, with his attendants. ENRIQUE. Good Heavens! my brain whirls round and round! [Falls. ARÃAS. May Heaven protect your grace! KING. How now? ARÃAS. His steed has fallen, I know not how, And thrown the prince upon the ground. KING. If in this manner he doth kneel, Saluting Seville's ancient towers, Better it were the heavenly powers Had still detained him in Castile. Enrique! Brother! DIEGO. Lord! and chief! KING. Does he not move? ARÃAS. Alas! like stone He lies; his pulse and colour gone. What sad mischance! DIEGO. What bitter grief! KING. To yonder pretty country-seat Beside the public way, advance, Good Don ArÃ­as; there, perchance, The quiet of the calm retreat May soon the prince's health restore. Here you can all remain, and see The end; but bring a horse to me, For I have yet to travel more: This accident has made me wait Too long already. I must try, Before the light of day doth die, To reach as far as Seville's gateâ There you can bring the news to me. [Exit. ARÃAS. This single act that now we know, More than a thousand proofs will show How stern and hard his heart must be, Who could a brother thus neglect, Leaving him without sense or breath, And struggling in the arms of death? By heaven!â DIEGO. Be silent. Recollect, That if at times stone walls may hear, Trees, Don ArÃ­as, sometimes see; Besides, 'tis naught to you or me, And might, perchance, soon cost us dear. ARÃAS. Thou, Don Diego, quickly go To yonder villa; bring them word How that the prince, our gracious lord, Is thrown from off his horse. But no; Better that in his present state, We bear the Infante in. DIEGO. You give Good counsel. ARÃAS. Let Enrique live, I ask no other boon of fate! Exeunt, the attendants bearing the Infante. SCENE II. âA SALOON IN DON GUTIERRE'S VILLA. Enter DOÃA MENCIA and JACINTA. MENCIA. I saw him from the tower below, The winding road advancing over; And though I could not well discover What followed after, well I know That some misfortune has occurred. I saw a gallant cavalier Upon a light steed riding near, It rather seemed the swiftest bird That ever on the quick winds flew; For like a bird's rich plumes, his crest, Descending o'er his head and breast, Upon the air its splendour threw: The earth and sky did both unite To grace it with their several powersâ The beauteous earth bestowed its flowers, The wondrous sky its starry lightâ Changeful in hue, as chance doth fling, Or tinted shades, or golden beams, For now a perfect sun it seems, And now it seems the painted spring. The steed that thus did prance and bound Fell; when another change occurred: For what did late appear a bird Lay like a rose upon the ground,â Thus imitating in one hour Whate'er is best of bright and fair. 'Twas sunâ'twas skyâ'twas earth and air: At once bird, beast, and star, and flower! JACINTA. Ah! SeÃ±ora, hither press In through the doorwayâ MENCIA. Who? JACINTA. A throng, Crowding confusedly along. MENCIA. Why they come here I cannot guess. Enter DON ARÃAS and DON DIEGO following the attendants carrying the INFANTE in their arms. They place him in a chair. DIEGO. In the houses of the noble Is the royal blood so valued, So esteemed, it gives us courage Here to enter in this manner. MENCIA. Who is this I see? Oh, Heavens! [Aside. DIEGO. 'Tis the Infante, Don Enrique, Brother of the king, Don Pedro. At your door his horse has fallen, And, half dead, we've brought him hither. MENCIA, aside. Help me, Heaven! O sad misfortune! ARIAS. Tell us, lady, in what chamber We can place the prince, our master, Till he may regain his senses.â But can I trust my eyes, SeÃ±ora? ... MENCIA. Don ArÃ­as? ARÃAS. Oh! 'tis certain This is all a dream, a vision, That I see thee, that I hear thee: Can it be that Don Enrique, The Infanteâyour adorerâ Now your lover more than everâ Coming back to thee and Seville, In so sad a manner meets thee? MENCIA. 'Tis no dream:âalas! 'tis real. ARÃAS. Here what dost thou? MENCIA. Thou wilt know it Presently; but now we cannot Spare a moment from attending On the suffering prince, your master. ARÃAS. Who'd have said, that thus so strangely He would come to see you? MENCIA. Silence;â It concerns me, Don ArÃ­as. ARÃAS. Why? MENCIA. It doth affect my honour:â Enter into yonder chamber, There you'll find a couch that's covered With a soft skin, flower-embroideredâ And, although the bed be humble, There the prince may rest. Jacinta, Quickly bring the finest linen, Perfumed with the sweetest odours, Worthy of such high employment. Exit Jacinta. ARÃAS. While they make their preparations, Let us leave a while his highness. We, perchance, may give assistance, If there's help in this misfortune. Exeunt Don ArÃ­as, Don Diego, and the attendants. MENCIA. Now, at length, alone they've left me: Would, oh! would it were, ye heavens! With the sanction of my honour. Now to speak my inmost feelings: Would that I with words could open The icy dungeon of my silence, Where the glowing flame is prisoned;â That sad dungeon which, in ashes, Even in its ruins telleth, Here was Love! What's this I've spoken? What is this, ye heavenly powers? Ah! I'm what I am! Return me, Tell-tale air, the frenzied accents Thou hast from my pale lips carried; Since, although I've dared to breathe them, 'Tis not right that thou should'st publish What I ought to hide in silence; For I know that now I am not Mistress of my heart or feelings; And if I, to-day, indulge in These my feelings, 'tis but only That I may the more subdue them; Since no virtue can be real That has not been tried. 'Tis only In the crucible that truly Gleams the golden ore; the loadstone Tests the steel, and by the diamond Is the diamond tried: while metals Gleam the brighter in the furnace. Thus my honour, by relying On itself, shall still grow brighter, When I come myself to conquerâ Since no honour can be perfect That has never yet been tested. Pity!âPowers of goodness, pity! May I, thus my love concealing, Live! as now I die, in silence!â Enrique!âlord! ENRIQUE, recovering. Who calls? MENCIA. O! gladness. ENRIQUE. Heaven be praised!â MENCIA. That you are living Still, your highness. ENRIQUE. Say, where am I? MENCIA. Where, at least, is one that feeleth For your safety. ENRIQUE. I believe it,â If this happiness, for being Mine, shall not in air evanish: Since, within myself debating, I am doubtful at this moment Whether I awake, am dreaming, Or asleep, but seem to hear thee: But why make inquiry further, Seeming truth still darker clouding? If 'tis true that now I slumber, May I never wake from sleeping! Or if I in truth am waking, May I never sleep henceforward! MENCIA. Let it please your royal highness Prudently to think but only Of your health, that it may lengthen Out your life through years unnumbered. PhÅnix of your deathless gloryâ Imitating that strange being, Bird, and flame, red coal, and glow-worm, Urn, pile, voice, and conflagration, Which in fire is generated, Breathes, and lives, and lasts, and dyethâ Of itself the child and parentâ Then you'll learn from me hereafter Where you are. ENRIQUE. I do not wish it; Since if I do live, and see thee, Greater bliss I cannot hope for; Nor if I am dead, can ever Greater happiness delight me, Since, indeed, it must be heaven Where so fair an angel dwelleth. Thus I care not to discover What the accidents or chances That my life have hither guided, Nor what turned thy own life hither; Since to know that I am with you, Where you are, is full contentment. And thus you have naught to tell me, Nor to aught have I to listen. MENCIA. Of so many fair illusions Time will quickly disabuse thee. But at present, tell me truly How your highness is? ENRIQUE. Why, never Have I in my life been better; Only in this foot, a little Pain I feel. MENCIA. The fall was fearful; But a little rest will quickly All your former health restore thee. And thy bed is now preparing, Where thou canst repose in safety. You will pardon me, I pray thee, For such humble entertainment; Though, indeed, I stand excused. ENRIQUE. Spoken like a noble lady, Mencia. Are you then the mistress Of this house? MENCIA. Why no, your highness, But of him who is the master, I must say I am. ENRIQUE. Who is he? MENCIA. An illustrious caballero, SolÃ­s Alfonso Gutierre, Both my husband and your servant. ENRIQUE. What!âyour husband! [Rises. MENCIA. Yes, your highness. Do not raise yourself; detain thee. See, to stand you are not able On your foot. ENRIQUE. Yes, yes, I'm able. Enter DON ARÃAS. ARÃAS. Let me, lord, enfold a thousand Times your feet in my embraces, Grateful for the happy favour Which, in saving thee, has given Life unto us all. Enter DON DIEGO. DIEGO. Your highness, Now unto your own apartment Can retire, where all is ready That the finest thought could picture On the fancy. ENRIQUE. Don Arias, Bring me here my horse this instantâ Bring me my horse, good Don Diego: Hence we must depart this moment. ARÃAS. What do you say, my lord? ENRIQUE. That quickly You bring here my horse. DIEGO. Considerâ ARÃAS. Think a momentâ ENRIQUE. Troy is burning, And my heart, a new Ãneas, Must I rescue from the ruin!â Ah! Don Arias, my o'erthrowing Was not purely accidental, Rather a prophetic omen Of my death: indeed, 'twas fitting That, by Heaven's decree, I hither Should be carried to my death-bed, In the house where you are married, To Mencia. That at once might then be spoken Gratulations and condolence, For your wedding and my burial. When my horse approached your dwelling He, with double fire and spirit, Dared the most surprising actions: For a rapid bird appearing, He, with scornful neighings, challenged Even the lightnings to the combat, When the swift winds he had conquered; 'Till, before your very threshold, Jealousy raised unseen mountains, Over which his proud feet stumbled; For sharp jealousy will madden Even the very brute. No rider Ever sat his horse so firmly, That he could not from his stirrups Be cast down at such a moment: Miracle of thy sweet beauty, I conceived this fall the saving Of my life: but now the illusion Being o'er, it seems the vengeance Of my death: since it is certain I, indeed, must die; and never Miracles are proved by dying. MENCIA. He who now would hear your highness Thus complaining and repining, Would be forced to treat my honour With presumptions and suspicions Most unworthy of it: nathless, If, perchance, the wind doth carry Any perfect observation, Without tearing it asunder In divided accents, I would Wish to answer such impeachments; For whene'er complaints are spoken, Often will the same breath utter Explanations too. Your highness, Liberal in all your fanciesâ Generous in all your pleasuresâ Prodigal of your affectionsâ Placed your eyes on me: I know itâ It is true, and I believe it. You must also know how many Years of trial and temptation Has my honour been unvanquished, Standing like an ice-crowned mountain, Which the squadrons of the flowers, Armed by time, were round besieging. If I married, with what reason Can you now complain? well knowing I was one beyond the circle Of your passions and your wishes: Far too high to be your mistress, Far too low to be your consort. Thus being wholly exculpated In this matter, as a woman, Humbly at your feet I ask you, Not, my lord, to leave this mansion, Placing at such certain peril Health and life. ENRIQUE. Ah! greater dangers Do I in this house encounter. Enter DON GUTIERRE and COQUIN. GUTIERRE. Let me to your highness render Homage, if I dare draw nigh To the sun that lights the sky Of Spain with majesty and splendour. With my heart, and confused and tender, Sad and joyful, draw I near; And with eyes both blind and clear, Where that planet's light is blazing, Now an eagle, sunward gazing, Now a dazzled moth appearâ Sad, for that mischance which late, When you fell, did darkly throw O'er Castile a cloud of woeâ Joyful, that the hand of Fate Has unto its former state, With the charms that health embraces, Quite restored your lordship's life: Thus, confused in pleasing strife, Interchanging mutual graces, Pain and Pleasure change their places.â Who till now saw Pleasure's tear? Who till now saw Sorrow's smile?â Honour, for a little while, With your beams this humble sphere; For the sun, so bright and clear, Though it light a palace wall, Still doth not disdain to fall, With its veil of golden woof, On the straw-thatched cottage roof, In its loving care of all: Thus wilt thou, who dost appear The sun of Spain, by tarrying here. 'Tis not the splendour that outbreaks, It is the king the palace makes, Even as the sun doth make the sphere. ENRIQUE. I esteem your pain and pleasure As you felt it; and for this, Gutierre Alfonso de SolÃ­s, Gratitude beyond all measure In my bosom shall I treasure, Which you yet must feel. GUTIERRE. Your grace Honours me too much. ENRIQUE. And though The greatness of this house did throw Its ample shadow round the place, Though 'twere a sphere as great in space, As it in truth is beauty's sphere, Still I could not here remain: This fall will cost my life 'tis plain; And not the fall alone, for here I must forego, in doubt and fear, An object that doth all engage My mind; and were it but one stage I must depart; till that is clear, Every moment is a year, Every instant is an age. GUTIERRE. And can my lord have such a cause For thus departing hence, that he Will place in such extremity A life whose every action draws Down on itself the world's applause? ENRIQUE. I must this day to Seville go. GUTIERRE. To pierce your secret well I know Is wrong, and that would greatly grieve My sense of right; but I believe My love, my loyalty are soâ ENRIQUE. And if the cause I now would own, What would you say? GUTIERRE. I do not seek The silence of your breast to break; My lord, I'm not so curious grown. ENRIQUE. Listen; the cause shall now be known. I had a friend, who was to me A second selfâ GUTIERRE. How blest was he! ENRIQUE. To whom, when led by duty's call Away, I did entrust my allâ My lifeâmy soulâone peerless she! Say, was it just that he should break His plighted faith, his friend forsake, And all his promised care forego, When I was absent from him? GUTIERRE. No. ENRIQUE. When for another's will and pleasure, He gave the keys of that rich treasure; When to another favoured guest, He oped that fond and feeling breast That late was mine! How truly measure The lover's pain, the friend's regret! Can the lorn heart so soon forget Its vanished dreamsâits blissful sighs? GUTIERRE. No, my good lord! ENRIQUE. And then the skies Conspire to darken and to fret My heart to-day! Before my eyes I see my jealous thoughts arise; In bodily shape they stand before me; Where'er I look, they threaten o'er me, With monstrous leer and giant size. I see them here, and so would fain Fly from their looks so dark and drear: Strange though the miracle appear, They come with me, and yet remain! MENCIA. They say a woman's heart and brain Can best good council feel and give; And so I pray, my lord, forgive The freedom that I take, when I Attempt the adviser's part to try, And make you once more hope and live. I leave your jealousy apart, And say, that you should first attend The explanation of your friend. His innocence, fear more than art, May quick restore him to your heart, For even in faults such difference lies, That punishment should not be given To all alike. Oh! be not driven Headlong by passion's stormy sighs, Though jealousy o'erveils thine eyes. Think that no man has power to move Another being's will or love. As to your friend, methinks that I Have given your doubts a fit reply. As to the lady, Heaven above Alone can tell how strong the power That forced her to forget thy flame. Oh! call her no unworthy nameâ The fickle changeling of an hour. Judge her not, though suspicion lowerâ She may excuse her act. ENRIQUE. Ah! well I know 'tis vain. DIEGO, to the INFANTE. My lord, the steed Is ready that you bade me lead. GUTIERRE. If 'tis the same from which you fell This morn, my lord, ah! do not sell Your life so cheap, as him to ride; Rather accept from me the pride Of all my studâa piebald mareâ Swift as the wind and wondrous fair, Upon whose smooth and glossy side A palm-leaf is impressedâa sign That fortune meant her to be thine; For, even of brutes, the birthdays are Ruled by a good or evil star. This wondrous prodigy, in fine, Is quite proportioned and well made; Wide in the back, and broad of chest; Its head and neck, as might be guessed, Short, and its feet and legs arrayed In strength, and daring undismayed. To form this steed, so light and tall, With its wide chest, and head so small, The mingled elements conspireâ Its body earth, its soul of fireâ Its foam the sea, and wind for all. ENRIQUE. Here the mind is lost, indeed, At the effort to explain Which doth lose, or which doth gain, By this animated dictionâ Whether the steed by the description, Or the description by the steed. COQUIN. Here I enter. Please your grace, Let me your hand or foot embrace, Though it is hard, as matters stand, Either to give your foot or hand. GUTIERRE. Hence, fool! this moment quit the place. ENRIQUE. Why so? Do not his freedom blameâ His humour pleases me. COQUIN. I came, Obedient to your call. You said, Hither let the steed be led. Well we, my lord, are both the same. ENRIQUE. Then who are you? COQUIN. My words declare My station. I, my lord, am one Coquin, also Coquin's son; The livery of this house I wearâ Provider-general of the mare; I sleep amid its fragrant hay; In liberal fellowship I share Its nightly bed and daily fare; And so, my lord, I come to pay My compliments upon your day. ENRIQUE. My day? COQUIN. Why yes, the thing is plain. ENRIQUE. They call that day a festival, Whereon some good event doth fall. How can the day that brought me pain Be mine? Good Coquin, pray explain. COQUIN. Because you fell on it. They say, As every body knows, in all The almanacks, such feasts do fall On such and such a day. Then pray, Is this not Saint Enrique's day? GUTIERRE. If your lordship is so prest, That you must go, 'tis best you stay No longer here; for lo! the day, Amid the cold waves of the west, Sinks, to be the sea-god's guest. ENRIQUE. Fairest Mencia, Heaven protect you! And to show that I respect you, I will seek that lady, driven By the counsel you have given. Ah! my grief, must I reject you [Aside. From my breast unspoken. Bleed, Bleed in silence, and restrain Even the utterance of thy pain. Sad exchange I've made indeedâ To leave my love and take his steed! Exeunt the Infante, Don ArÃ­as, Don Diego, Coquin, and the attendants. GUTIERRE. O dearest Mencia!âbrightestâbestâ My queen, my mistress, and my wife! Two souls in each divided lifeâ Two lives in each divided breast Have thou and I, my love, possest. 'Tis to that love, that now I feel, I may securely trust to-day, For leave to go awhile away, And at my sovereign's feet to kneel, Upon his entering Castile. To give him hearty welcome there, Should every cavalier repair. Methinks I should his presence gain As one of Don Enrique's train; For it is only just and fair, That I upon the prince should wait, Who, from this fall, has given so great An honour to this house and me. MENCIA. Some other cause, I plainly see, Moves thee to go, than what you state. GUTIERRE. Naught else, I swear, by those bright eyes! MENCIA. Who doubts that unextinguished sighs For Leonoreâfrom this dull spot Drive you away? GUTIERRE. Oh! name her not. MENCIA. 'Tis thus with men, to-day they prize The thing to-morrow they may shun; And what was joy to win, when won Turns in their hearts to cold despair. GUTIERRE. Ah! yes, I own the moon looked fair, Because I did not see the sun; But now that I behold its light, And worship its divinest ray, I cannot so forget the day As think upon the vanished night, A flame once burned pure and bright, Whose lambent breath and shining hair Lit the sweet region of the air. The sun unveiled his glorious head, When lo! amid the orient red, The roseate blush of morning fair, The little flame was lost and gone; No more it sparkled, burned and shone, Quenched in the sunlight's sea of rays. Need I explain, with useless phrase, The little picture I have drawn? I loved a light, whose flame was seen Until a greater planet roseâ Which, in the light that planet throws From off its disk of dazzling sheen, Vanished as if it ne'er had been. The flame that once seemed pure and bright, As in a crucible of light, Was melted by thy sunnier eyes; Until the sun appears, we prize The faintest star that decks the night. MENCIA. Oh! what a flatterer thou artâ So metaphysical, and so ... GUTIERRE. In fine, you give me leave to go. MENCIA. 'Tis plain you're anxious to depart; And yet, I cannot nerve my heart To bid you go. GUTIERRE. Perhaps we two, In thought, may both depart and stay. My heart, though I be far away, Will still be hereâ MENCIA. And mine with you. Adieu, my lord. GUTIERRE. My love, adieu! [Exit. Enter JACINTA. JACINTA. How sad, my lady, you remain. MENCIA. Ah! yes, Jacinta, and with cause. JACINTA. I cannot guess what reason draws The colour from your cheek: 'tis plain Some hidden grief, some inward pain Affects you. MENCIA. Yes, 'tis even so. JACINTA. Will you not trust the cause to me? MENCIA. Dost thou desire I trust to thee My honour and my life, and show My inmost secrets? Thou shalt know. JACINTA. Say on, SeÃ±ora. MENCIA. I was born In Seville. There Enrique saw And loved me, by the potent law That rules the world; subdued my scorn, And, like a star that doth adorn The brow of heaven, upraised my name First in the lover's lists of fame. My father, by abuse of might, Restrained and trampled on my right Of choice, and gave, short time ago, My hand to Gutierre. Lo! The prince returns: my heart is painedâ Love I have lost, and honour gained. And this is all even I do know. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âA HALL IN THE ALCÃZAR, AT SEVILLE. Enter DONA LEONORE and INES, veiled. INES. He comes to seek the chapel's calm retreat. Here wait the king, and kneel before his feet. LEONORE. Now shall I gain what I have hoped for long, If I obtain but vengeance for my wrong. Enter the KING followed by attendants and petitioners. VOICES, within. Make way! ONE. So please your majesty, peruse This paper. KING. I shall do so. ANOTHER. Oh! refuse Not this, your grace. ANOTHER. Nor this one, I beseech. KING. 'Tis well, 'tis well. SOLDIER, aside. He wasteth little speech. I amâ [Aloud. KING. Leave the petitionâthat will do. SOLDIER. I tremble, and cannot my fear subdue. KING. What makes you fear. SOLDIER. Have I not seen your grace? KING. Yes; 'tis enough! What seek you in this place? SOLDIER. My lord, I am a soldier: some more pay. KING. You ask but little; for your late dismay. I make you serjeant. SOLDIER. Oh! with outstretched palms I bless you! OLD MAN. A poor old man asks your alms. KING. Here, take this diamond ring. OLD MAN. What! can it be You give it from your fingers unto me? KING. Yes! had I power to aid thy suffering, I would bestow the world as now this ring. LEONORE, kneeling. My lord, with troubled feet I come Before your feet to fall. I come, for honour's sake, To ask, with weeping eyes, With sighs soon swallowed up in tears, With words that end in sighs, For justice at your hands, As I on God do call. KING. Lady, arise; no fear need thee appal. LEONORE. I am ... [She rises. KING. Do not, I pray, address me yetâ Let all who hear me go away. [The petitioners, and others go out. Speak now, because if you have fled To me for honour's sake, as you have said, It were not just or right That honour should complain thus in the public sight; Or that the hand of justice e'er should trace The slightest blush upon so sweet a face. LEONORE. Don Pedro! whom the world doth call the Just, âJusticiero,â Don Pedro is better known by his less complimentary title âThe Cruel.â Sole Sun and Sovereign planet of Castile, Whose light illumes this hemisphere of dust, Great Spanish Jove, from whose well-tempered steel Quick lightnings flashed with every vengeful thrust, As through the quivering air, with bloody wheel, It circled, when from clouds of gold it flew, And many and many a Moorish neck cut through, I am Leonore, whom flatterers named, In Andalusia, Leonore the Fair. Not for this name my beauty must be blamed, But my malignant star; for never were Beauty and happiness together framed To live in union, or one form to bear. Be sure, my lord, where beauty doth abound But small good fortune and less bliss are found. His glances turned on me, to cause my ruin; A cavalierâah! would that love's slow sting Were as the basilisk's for my undoing, Or jealousy's green serpent to my spring. To looking fondly, soon came fond pursuing, To fond pursuing, love on rapid wing. He wooed my very street, in his desire; There saw he night depart, and day expire. How can I tell, my gracious lord, that wounded, At length my heart surrendered to his suit? Although in public by disdain surrounded, I felt in private proud of his pursuit. On obligation gratitude is founded, From gratitude the passion-flower takes root; For in Love's University we seize Upon his dignities but by degrees. A little spark a mighty flame igniteth; A little wind can wake the whirlwind's crash; A deluge from a little cloud alighteth; A little light can feed the lightning's flash; A little love, though blind and small delighteth To find out wiles that must the god abash: Thus spark, wind, cloud, and all delight in turning To storm and rain, to lightning and to burning. His word he gave me he would be my spouseâ A bait that doth so many women lure, Which in life's sea the cautious fisher throws, With hellish heart, for maiden honour pure; Which wooes the bosom to unsafe repose, And lulls the sense to slumber insecure. Here my lip fails to tell how he, untrue, Who gave this word, again recalled it too. Thus freely often to my house came he; But honour never for a moment slept; For I, though liberal of love could be, Niggard of that, which I have sacred kept; But, then, there was so much publicity, That I my reputation could have wept, And thought 'twere best that I should less deserve it Than thus with public scandal to preserve it. Justice I sought, but I was very poorâ Complained of him, but he was very strong: Then as my honour is beyond all cureâ For he is wed, and can't make good my wrongâ All that I ask, most gracious lord of your Justice is this, that cloistered I prolong My life at his expense who did all thisâ Don Gutierre Alfonso de SolÃ­s. KING. Lady, your extreme affliction I compassionate, and justly, Being one upon whose shoulders, Atlas-like, the law dependeth: Since Don Gutierre's married, He cannot make fit atonement For your wrong, as you have granted; But though short of that full measure Of redress, my power and justice Are sufficient to compel him To make partial compensation. Honour he cannot restore you, Since, indeed, you never lost it. On the other side, however, We must hear his explanation; For 'tis right a judge should always Keep his second ear wide open For the story that comes after. Trust me, Leonore, that nothing Shall prevent your cause from being Fairly tested; and that never You again will have occasion To repeat your lamentation, âI am poor, and he is powerful,â While Castile doth call me monarch. Yonder Gutierre cometh; If with me he chance to see you, He will know you have informed me: Hide behind this screen a little, Till you can come forth in safety. LEONORE. I, in everything obey you. [She conceals herself. Enter COQUIN. COQUIN. On from chamber unto chamber, In the footsteps of my master, Who is staying here, I've wandered Just this far. Defend me, Heaven! Bless me! 'tis the king in person! He has seen me, and looks awful. Heaven but grant that this balcony Is not very high, for headlong Must I throw myself this moment. KING. Who are you? COQUIN. My lord? KING. Yes. COQUIN. Truly (Aid me, Heaven), my lord, I'm only What your majesty would wish me: Nothing greater, nothing smaller; For a man of much discretion Only yesterday advised me, That I never, in my lifetime, Should be aught but what you'd wish me; And so highly do I value His advice, I mean to use it, For the present, past, and future. Thus I was what you'd have had me; What you'd wish me be, I will be; What you please, I amâat all times Your obedient humble servant. So, my liege, with your permission, I would wish now to withdraw me; Since my feet have brought me hither, I would do as much for them too. KING. Notwithstanding your long answer, You, in truth, have told me nothing. Who and what you are I asked you. COQUIN. And I would have truly answered To the question you have asked me, If I did not fear, for telling Who I am, that you would throw me From this high balcony downward, For presuming here to enter Without knowing why or wherefore, Being the holder of an office Which you do not need, I fancy. KING. What office do you hold? COQUIN. Why, that of A sort of courier, or footman, Bearer of all kinds of secretsâ Spy of myriad proceedings, So that neither monk nor novice Ever yet escaped my prying. Just as I get much or little, Speak I either well or badly. Every house I make my dwelling; And though this be so, at present, I'm content to use the stable Of Don Alfonso Gutierre, Where my mid-day meal I share with A cordovÃ n of Andalusia. I'm a brother of Contentment; Grief to me is quite a stranger, Not being ever in his service. Briefly, I am what you see me: Marjordomo unto Laughter, Pleasure's gentleman in waiting, And the chamberlain of Frolicâ Which a glance, indeed, might show you. This being so, with fear I trembled Lest your majesty might know me; For a king who never laugheth Might have ordered me a hundred Fisticuffs and bastinadoes Somewhere underneath the shoulders, As a vagabond. KING. It seemeth You are, briefly, one whose business Is but laughter. COQUIN. Yes, your lordship, And that you may be more certain, This it is to play the jester, In the palace. [He puts on his cap. KING. Right well, truly; And since now I know your calling, Let us make a bargain. COQUIN. How so? KING. To make one laugh is your profession? COQUIN. Yes. KING. Well, then, for each occasion That you make me laugh, I'll give you A hundred crowns; but on condition, That if ere a month is over, You don't make me laugh, that instant You your teeth to me must render. COQUIN. Ah! you make me a false witness, And the contract is illegal, Being hurtful to one party. KING. Why? COQUIN. It will hurt me, with a vengeance. 'Tis said that every man in laughing, Shows his teeth; but I with weeping Should show mineâwhich would be laughing The wrong way. 'Tis also whispered That you're so severe a master, And so biting in your censure, As to show your teeth to all men. How, then, is it that you only Wish to take my grinders from me? But to come to your proposal, I accept it, if you let me Go away in peace at present; Since a month will pass as quickly Here as in the street; and even At the end 'tis but the coming Of old age a little sooner To my mouth, as with post-horses. So I go to practise over All my jokes. Ah! would to Heaven! That I could but see you laughing! But adieu! I'll see thee shortly. [Exit. Enter DON ENRIQUE, DON GUTIERRE, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, with attendants, soldiers, &amp;c. ENRIQUE. Let your majesty permit me Kiss your hand. KING. Thou'rt truly welcome; How dost thou feel thyself, Enrique? ENRIQUE. Why, my lord, the fright was greater Than the fall. I ne'er felt better. GUTIERRE. I pray your majesty to let me Kiss your hand, if one so humble May demand so great a favour; For the ground on which thou walkest Seems a fair and beauteous carpet, Which the winds of heaven illumine With the colour of the rose-leaf. Mayst thou health and strength bear with thee, Such as this great kingdom needeth; For, my lord, all Spain adores you, Crowned, as now thou art, with laurel. KING. Of you! Don Gutierre Alfonso .... GUTIERRE. Why thus turn thy back upon me? KING. Great complaints but now have reached me. GUTIERRE. They are most unjust, I doubt not. KING. Tell me, know you Leonoraâ One of the chief dames of Seville? GUTIERRE. Yes, a fair and noble lady, 'Mong the highest of this country. KING. Say what potent obligation Made you treat so fair a lady With discourtesy and insult? GUTIERRE. I have little need of falsehood; For, my lord, a man of honour Knows not how to play the liar, 'Specially before a monarch. Her I courted, and intended, Once, to marry, if delaying, And perhaps my fickle nature, Had not changed my first ideas. Her I visited, and often Entered publicly her dwelling; So that I would still defend her Reputation, with my sword-point. Feeling, then, thus alienated, I conceived that I might alter My intent; and, being freed from This affection, wed in Seville DoÃ±a Mencia de AcÃ»na, A distinguished lady, with whom I reside outside the city, In a country-house of pleasure. Leonore, through evil counselâ For all counsel must be evil Which destroyeth reputationâ Sought to interrupt my marriage; But the judge who tried the question, Though most strict, found naught against me; Which decision she did charge with Being founded upon favour, As if favour e'er is wanting To a young and handsome woman, If she ever should require it. Influenced by this delusion, She has come to claim your succour, For 'tis plain you know the story. I, too, throw myself before you, Firmly trusting to your justice. For my faith, my sword I offer, And my head for my allegiance. KING. What could have so soon occasioned Such a change in your affections? GUTIERRE. Is man's fickleness so novel As to cause your wonder? Surely Every day bears witness to it. KING. Yes: but then it seldom happens That a man who loves should fly from One extreme unto another, Without some most powerful reason. GUTIERRE. I beseech you not to press me: I am one who, in the absence Of a lady, would surrender Life in preference to speaking Anything unworthy of her. KING. Then it seems you had some reason. GUTIERRE. Yes, my lord; but still, believe me, If for my exoneration, It this day were needful for me To declare it,âthough depended Life and soul upon my speakingâ Still a true and faithful lover Of his honour would not say it. KING. But it is my wish to know it. GUTIERRE. Ah! my lord .... KING. I'm very curious. GUTIERRE. Look .... KING. No further answer make me! It doth only irritate me. By my life!â .... GUTIERRE. My lord, I pray thee Swear not; for 'tis less important I should change my nature wholly, Than that I should see you angered. KING, aside. I compel him to lay open This concealed affair thus loudly, That, if he in this deceives me, Leonore may give the answer. And if he the truth doth utter, That, persuaded of her error, Leonore may know it also,â Speak then. [Aloud. GUTIERRE. To my grief, I do so.â As one night I sought her dwelling, Noises reached me from the courtyard;â I approached, and at the moment That I entered, saw the figure Of a man from her balcony Downward leaping. I pursued him; But, before I recognised him, He escaped from me by running. ARÃAS, aside. Bless me, Heaven! What revelation Comes to light! GUTIERRE. And though excuses Could be made, and though I never To my wrong gave ample credence, Still the very apprehension Was enough to stop my marriage; For 'tis plain, if love and honour Are the mind's most powerful passions, He hath done to love an outrage Who hath done a wrong to honourâ Any pang that wounds the feelings To the soul brings anguish also. Enter LEONORE. LEONORE. Your majesty will grant me pardon, Since I can endure no longer All the manifold misfortunes Which in crowds have fallen upon me. KING, aside. As God lives! he has deceived me.â Well, my stratagem succeedeth. LEONORE. And when listening to those charges Which are brought against my honour, It were but to act the coward Not at once to give the answer, Though it cost me lifeâ'tis little. For, far worse than death I suffer From those daring accusations Which destroy both life and honour. Don ArÃ­as came to visit .... ARÃAS. Stay, SeÃ±oraâspeak not further. Let your majesty permit me Answer; for it is my duty To defend this lady's honour. On that very night resided, In the house of Leonore, One with whom I would have married, If her thread of life the ParcÃ¦ Had not cruelly divided; I, her beauty's faithful lover, Fondly followed in her footsteps, And, with all a lover's daring, After her the house I entered, Without Leonore being able To foresee it or prevent it. Then Don Gutierre coming, Leonore, in terror, bade me Seek a neighbouring apartment, And I did so.âAh! a thousand Errors must that man fall into Who obeys a woman's counsel.â As I left, I heard the stranger Speak; and, thinking 'twas her husband, Down I leaped from the balcony: And if I, on that occasion, Turned my face away, supposing He was married to the ladyâ Now, since he declares he is not, Face to face I stand before him. Let your majesty, I pray thee, Grant a field, whereon to combat For the fame of Leonore. This appeal the law concedeth Unto every caballero. GUTIERRE, putting his hand on his sword. I will follow wheresoever .... KING. How!âwhat's this? And dare you venture Thus to touch your swords before me? Does my face awake no terror? Where I am, can men indulge in [To the guard. Pride or haughtiness? But take them Prisoners, on the very instant; Lead them to two separate turretsâ And be thankful for the favour That you are not placed in fetters. [Exit. ARÃAS. If fair Leonore did forfeit Fame by me, by me she likewise Will regain itâwhich is owing To the honour of a woman. GUTIERRE. I do not, in this misfortune, Feel so much my sovereign's rigour, As that I, my dearest Mencia, Cannot hope this day to see thee. [They are led out by the soldiers. ENRIQUE, aside. Under the pretext of hunting, And her husband here, this evening May afford me an occasion To see Mencia.âDon Diego, [Aloud. Come with me;âI am determined Now to perish or to conquer. [Exeunt. LEONORE. Dead I here remain! God grant that, Heartless, treacherous, and cruel, False deceiver and dissembler, Without faith, or God, or conscience, As I innocently suffered Loss of fame and reputation, Heaven may also grant me vengeance! May you feel the selfsame sorrow That I feel! The same dishonour May you in your blood see bathed! For 'tis only just you perish With the weapons that you slay with! Be it so! amen. So be it! Woe is me! I've lost my honour! Woe is me! my death has found me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âTHE GARDEN OF DON GUTIERRE'S VILLA.âNIGHT. Enter JACINTA, conducting DON ENRIQUE. JACINTA. Silently advance. ENRIQUE. I scarcely Place my feet upon the ground. JACINTA. 'Tis the garden we have entered:â Since the night with dusky mantle Wraps your Highness round, and since Now Don Gutierre lieth In his prison, there's no doubt But that you can safely compass Love's so gentle victories. ENRIQUE. If the liberty, Jacinta, I have promised thee, appears Small reward for such a service, Ask me more, I'll not refuse, Since to thee I am indebted, From this hour, for life and soul. JACINTA. Here my lady is accustomed To descend, to spend a portion Of the cool, calm summer night. ENRIQUE. Hush! oh, hush! another sentence Do not add, because I tremble That the very winds should hear us! JACINTA. That I may avoid suspicion By my absence, and avoid Needless blame, I think it better Now to leave you. [Goes into the house. ENRIQUE. Love encourage My attempt. These verdant leaves Will conceal and screen me wholly; For I will not be the first, Who, beneath such shelter, cheated Even the solar rays: ActÃ¦on With Diana exculpate me. [Conceals himself. Enter DOÃA MENCIA with her attendants. MENCIA. Jacinta! Silvia! Theodora! JACINTA. Your orders, Lady?â MENCIA. Here bring lights, And a while with me remaining, Labour to divert my sorrow For the absence of my husband, Now that nature doth presume These delicious grounds to darken:â Theodora! THEODORA. Lady mine! MENCIA. With your gentle voice divert me From my sadness. THEODORA. I shall gladly Sing your favourite words and tune. [The lights are placed upon a small table, DoÃ±a Mencia reclines upon a sofa beside it, and Theodora sings.] Nightingale, whose joyous strain Gladdens all these sleeping flowers, Oh! depart not from these bowers, For thy absence gives me pain! [While the song is continued and repeated, DoÃ±a Mencia falls asleep.] JACINTA. Sing no more, for see, sweet slumber Hath poured out upon her soul Rest and peace; and since her troubles Have this calm asylum found, Let us leave and not awake her. THEODORA. Yes, in silence leave her here. JACINTA, aside. Thus I act, that he may freely Venture forth to seek her now;â O ye servants! what unnumber'd Noble and illustrious houses Have been lost by means of you! [Exeunt Jacinta and the others. DON ENRIQUE, advancing. She remains alone. No longer Doubt should cloud such happiness; Oh! I must not let this moment Pass without the happy chance That the time, the place secure me:â Fairest Mencia! MENCIA, awaking. Heaven defend me! ENRIQUE. Be not frightened;â MENCIA. Who is this? ENRIQUE. One whose daring must be pardoned For his many years of hope. MENCIA. You, my lord! ... ENRIQUE. Oh! be not troubled! MENCIA. In this way to .... ENRIQUE. Nor alarmed:â MENCIA. Dare to enter .... ENRIQUE. Nor be angry. MENCIA. This my house, without the fear That you may destroy the honour Of a woman, and a noble, Generous vassal's pride offend. ENRIQUE. I but follow your own counsel, Since you counselled me to hear The excuses of that lady:â And I hither come to learn How it is you exculpate you From the wrongs my love hath borne. MENCIA. Ah! 'tis true, I was in error; But if I would deign to give Any reason for my actions, Does your highness doubt, 'tis only For my honour's sake alone? ENRIQUE. Can you then presume, I know not The respect that is your due, From your blood and many virtues?â A pretext of sport has led me Here, a seeming hunter, now. But 'twas neither fawn nor falcon Wiled me forth ere dawn of day; No, it was thyself, proud heronâ Thou, that soarest up so high Through the azure fields of heaven, That you seem to touch the golden Balustrades that gleam and glisten Round the palace of the sun. MENCIA. My lord, your highness doth correctly Attribute to this cautious bird The efforts you describe: the heron Presumes so much upon its instinct, That flying even up to heaven,â A flash of feathers without lightâ A bird of flame, with soul and spiritâ A wingÃ©d cloud endued with instinctâ A dark-grey comet without fire; It seeks by every means to baffle The strong wings of the royal hawks:â Nay, 'tis said, although it flies from All the falcons that pursue,â It doth know, amid the many, In whose talons it must die; And before the final struggle Is commenced, it trembles o'erâ Throbs its boding heart with terror, And on ruffled plumage flies:â Thus at seeing here your highness, I stand mute and motionlessâ Full of terrorâfull of horrorâ Since my fear cannot ignoreâ Since no doubt can terror leave me Who it is will cause my death. ENRIQUE. To speak with you I came hither, Time and chance must not be lost. MENCIA. That the heavens this wrong should suffer! I shall cry for aid. ENRIQUE. And so, Be thy honour's worse defamer. MENCIA. Oh! will not the wild beasts come To protect me with their favour? ENRIQUE. No, they fear to wake my wrath. DON GUTIERRE, within. Coquin, hold the reins, while I Alight: knock loudly at the gate. MENCIA. O heavens! my bodings come too late! My end of life at length draws nigh, 'Tis Gutierre!âWhat a fate! ENRIQUE. Born for misfortune I must be! MENCIA. What, my lord, becomes of me If he meets you?âwhat his ire? ENRIQUE. Say what can I do? MENCIA. Retire. ENRIQUE. Retire? conceal myself before The face of any man? MENCIA. Much more A woman's honour doth require: You cannot goâ(my life is o'er!) Since my servants, little knowing All the evil they were doing, Have reclosed the garden door: Now you cannot go away. ENRIQUE. How to act in this confusion...... MENCIA. In this arbour's green seclusion Lies a room of mine, you may There conceal you. ENRIQUE. Until now, I a notion ne'er could have What was meant by fear. How brave Ought a husband feel? [Conceals himself. MENCIA. And how Timid ought the guilty be, When a guiltless woman even Dreads the angry wrath of heaven, Nor can shun adversity? Enter DON GUTIERRE, COQUIN, and JACINTA. GUTIERRE. Dearest, let my fond caresses Once and many a time enfold thee! MENCIA. Envy, I cannot withhold thee From my heart, whose happy place is In the midst of such embraces. GUTIERRE. Said you not, that I would fly To see you? MENCIA. And to prove thereby The firm fond heart your breast doth cover. GUTIERRE. I do not cease to be thy lover, My life, because thy spouse am I; For that dear tie, so proudly pure, Chills not affection's tender core, But ever feeds it more and more, And makes its wavering pulse secure, And doth, at every risk, procure Means, the belovÃ©d form, for seeing, And closer binds his grateful being. He who holds the Alcaide's station, Being a friend and a relation, Has, my body's prison freeing, Thrown it round my soul, for he Gives me in this secret way The happy privilege to pay This hurried visit unto thee. MENCIA. What a joy it is! GUTIERRE. To meâ Although if I deliberate, The boon he gave was not so great To let me hither come to thee, Because in my captivity, My soul, on unseen wings elate, Had flown to thee in chainless flightâ Joy of my heart! 'twas only right That for the period I should be Wholly captive, or wholly free, And thus my life and soul unite; For otherwise in tiresome strife, With all division's sorrows rife, The two should seek a separate goal, In one prison were my soul, And in another were my life. MENCIA. Two instruments, I've heard it stated; When strung and tuned in unison; The dulcet notes evoked by one, By echo are communicated, Similarly modulated, To the other, so that even If you wake but one alone, On the silent lyre, the tone Which the skilful hand hath given Is waken'd by the winds of heaven! An equal concord doth appear 'Twixt blended hearts, how far or near, This would experience soon declare, For the same blow that struck thee there Would reach and kill me even here. COQUIN. SeÃ±ora, wont you give your hand Unto a fellow-prisoner, Who sighs and mourns and sheds the tear, Without the power to understand Why into tears he is trepanned? And who his death is now awaiting, Without the power of calculating Why or when this grisly friend Of mortals...... GUTIERRE. Coquin, to what end?â COQUIN. 'Tis my own end that I'm relating:â But if the king, who doth admire Your humble servant, in his ire Puts you to death without remorse, You'll be a sort of knight-errant corse, Since you will bring with you a squire. MENCIA, to Gutierre. You must partake of some collation; Excuse my want of preparation, No guest expecting now: and so I go for this. GUTIERRE. A slave can go. MENCIA. Holds not the one who goes, that station? Yes, I am one, and love to be: Do thou, Jacinta, come with me:â O fortune! fortune, be obedient, [Aside. Since this desperate expedient, Honour, I but make for thee! [Exeunt DoÃ±a Mencia and Jacinta. GUTIERRE. Coquin, here you must remain, And a little while restrain Your pleasantries: Remember we Are bound by every tie to be Back within our cell again Ere the dawn, which now is nigh. COQUIN. I shall faithfully attend you, But would wish to recommend you A stroke of ingenuityâ The most subtle, the most high Ever thought of amongst men, Oh! how clever! GUTIERRE. Tell it then. COQUIN. By which safe and sound you may Easily from prison stay. GUTIERRE. How? COQUIN. Never to go back again.â Better wind and limb to save Than keep the promise that you gave. Safe and sound outside you've got; Stay as you are. GUTIERRE. Upon the spot, My hand shall kill thee, villain! knave!â Dare you thus to counsel me To act with such base treachery Towards the Alcaide: in this way His kind confiding to betray? COQUIN. No doubt, there's some perplexity; But since I have become observant Of the king's humourâfierce and fervent Is my desire to escape his claws. As to a breach of honour's laws, No one will mind it in a servant; But even so, I am, to-day, Resolved to take the safer track, To leave you here, and not go back. GUTIERRE. To leave me? COQUIN. And why not, I pray? GUTIERRE. And what of thee will people say? COQUIN. Must I then prematurely die, To earn a word or two of praise? If I could act like him who plays At cards, who puts the small ones by, Preferring for success to rely On those of greater power and name;â Then, my lord, for you I durst Give up a few poor days at first, Which afterwards I might reclaim:â But is not life a different game? The cards once gone, then all is gone; How could I then get back the stake That thus I perilled for thy sake? As at piquet, death would have won Every point to a hundred and one. Enter MENCIA, exclaiming. MENCIA. Help! help! my lord. GUTIERRE. What mean these cries? May heaven my love from danger shield! MENCIA. A man...... GUTIERRE. Quick! quick! MENCIA. I found concealed Within my room, whose face and eyes Were hid beneath a thick disguise; For this I called you. GUTIERRE. What do you say? O Heavens! my very heart's congealed;â Disguised in my house? MENCIA. The moon revealed His presence. GUTIERRE. Coquin, lead the way, Take the light with you. COQUIN. I? GUTIERRE. You may Fear nothing, since with me you go. MENCIA, to Coquin. Coward thou art, to tremble so!â I shall conduct theeâdraw thy sword; Ah me! the light has fallen, my lord. [She designedly drops the light, and they remain in total darkness.] GUTIERRE. No matter, I shall find my foe Even in the dark: I go alone. [While Don Gutierre enters the house by one door, Don Enrique, conducted by Jacinta, leaves it by the other.] JACINTA. Follow me, my lord, you may Escape securely by this way, Since all the house to me is known. [As they go out at the opposite side, Don Gutierre returns, and meeting with Coquin, who is groping about in the dark, seizes him.] COQUIN, aside. I can see neither stick nor stone. GUTIERRE. Ah! I have met the man! COQUIN. My lord, Take heed, I pledge to thee my word .... GUTIERRE. By heavens! I shall not let thee go, Until thy name and state I know, Then thou shalt perish by my sword. COQUIN. But look! I am .... MENCIA, aside. What speechless terror Now doth my trembling soul affright! Can it be he? GUTIERRE. What, ho! a light! [Enter Jacinta, with a light.] Who art thou, man? COQUIN. I've got no mirror, But think I'm Coquin! GUTIERRE. What an error! What a mistake! COQUIN. I told thee so. GUTIERRE. I heard and knew thy voice, although I did not think thou wert the same I held:âO blind abyss! O shame! That I must tamely wait to know! MENCIA, aside. Has he gone forth, Jacinta? JACINTA. Yes. MENCIA, to Gutierre. Can thy absence have tempted this? Look well through all the house, lest some Who knew perchance thou wert from home, Some thieves have dared this hardiness. GUTIERRE. I go to make suspicion clear:â Kind heaven dispel the boding fear [Aside. That makes my heart feel chill and numb, To think that any man should come Into my house, and I not here! [Exit with Coquin. JACINTA. That was a daring stroke, attended With danger of a great disaster, Which you now ventured with my master. MENCIA. More than my life on it depended. JACINTA. What was the object you intended? MENCIA. This was intended: to dispel The clear presumption there would be Of some arranged complicityâ If Gutierre's heart should feel What I should die, or else concealâ In such a strange perplexity, I found but little difficulty The simple project to conceive, And thus make truth itself deceive. [Don Gutierre returns from the house, holding a dagger concealed beneath his cloak.] GUTIERRE. Some mere illusive phantasy Mocked youâsome fancied form of air; Through all the house I have gone with care, Searched every room, but could not meet The shadowy phantom of deceit Which you but now imagined there:â But I deceive myself:âah! meâ [Aside. This dagger, gracious heavens! which I Found in her roomâwith jealousy The herald of my fate must be, Which a more fitting hour will see:â My love, my life, I must away, [Aloud. For lo! the night, its cloak of grey Loosely around its neck untiesâ And like a trembling coward flies Before the beauteous light of day;â Ah! how I grieve it must be so, Not only that I needs must go, And longer leave you lonely here, But worseâa prey to causeless fear. MENCIA. Will you not once your fond arms throw Round her who loves you? GUTIERRE. Proud I may:â [As he throws open the cloak, she perceives the dagger in his hand.] MENCIA. Ah! stay, my lord! in pity, stay! Your dagger, is it turned on me? I never have offended thee, Turn then your vengeful hand away,â Hold! GUTIERRE. What makes my Mencia fear? My joy, my treasure, and my wife. MENCIA. At thus beholding you, my life Seemed to depart: I did appear Bathed in my blood to perish here. GUTIERRE. When lately through the house I flew, This dagger from its sheath I drew. MENCIA. My very life is an illusion! GUTIERRE. 'Twas but a fancyâa delusion. MENCIA. I never have offended thee. GUTIERRE. How needless this apology; But often in a great confusion We feel a fear we can't explain. MENCIA. My troubled sadness, as it seems, Chimeras and unreal dreams Doth picture on my heart and brain. GUTIERRE. To-night, I will return again To see thee, if I can: adieu! MENCIA. May God, my lord, depart with you!â Oh! what a fear my bosom pains! [Aside. GUTIERRE, aside. Ah! honourâhonour, much remains To say, but only 'twixt us two! [They go out at opposite sides. SCENE III. âA HALL IN THE ALCÃZAR. Enter the KING and DON DIEGO, the former carrying a shield, and dressed in a coloured cloak, which during the representation he changes for a black one. KING. Take this buckler, Don Diego. DIEGO. Late your majesty returns. KING. I have spent the night in going All around this city's streets, Wishing thus to know the nature Of the many strange adventures Which in such a place as Seville Happens every night that falls: That I thus may know the better To prevent or punish crime. DIEGO. You do well, my lord, in this, For a king should he an Argus, Watching o'er the realm he rules, And the eyes upon his sceptre Should but symbolize his own. Please your majesty, what saw you? KING. I saw many a sly gallantâ Many a waiting, watchful ladyâ Music-ringing feasts and dancingâ Many gambling-houses, whence Loud resounding voices published, Better than the painted tablet, Here is gaming, wanderer: I saw bullies without number, And there's nothing that so grieves me As to see this crowd of bullies Swagger openly, as if They a lawful calling followed; But that they should never praise me For neglecting to examine So important a communion, I a troop of them encounter'd In the open street alone. DIEGO. That was wrong, my lord,âimprudent. KING. No, 'twas right, because they carried Blazoned in their blood from me .... DIEGO. What? KING. The charter of their body. Enter COQUIN. COQUIN, aside. I have not the tower re-entered With my master, since I wish To find out what says the public Of his prisonment: but pause! For the noblest dog stands yonder Of the celebrated breed Of the true Castilian mastiffâ 'Tis the king himselfâDon Pedro, I must pause, his paws to shun. KING. Coquin! COQUIN. Majesty! KING. How goes it? COQUIN. I will answer like the student. KING. How is that? COQUIN. De corpore bene, Sed male de pecuniis. KING. Tell me something pleasant, Coquin, Since if you can make me laugh, You a hundred crowns will pocket. COQUIN. It seems that we enact to-night The famous comedy, entitled, From your promise, âThe Crown Prince;â Notwithstanding all, I bring thee Now a little tale, that neatly Endeth in an epigram. KING. If 'tis yours, it must be truly Elegant: unfold the tale. COQUIN. I saw yesterday a eunuch, On his getting out of bed, Put a cover on his whiskers; Laugh now at the bare idea! Seeing so much needless care On a crop of such poor promise Made me make the epigram:â I don't ask thee, mighty Pedro, For houses or vineyards,âall I ask Is that you, by way of earnest, Will your blessed laughter give Unto a bashful gracioso;â Floro, your house must needs be poor And badly furnished all within, Since in this way you're forced to pin A lying ticket on the door. Can there be rind without the core? Good nuts without the kernel?âno. He cannot reap who cannot sow,â Why then waste time? A harvest yields The ploughing of the fallow fields, But fallows faces neverâno!â KING. A cold conceit: COQUIN. A hot one, rather. Enter DON ENRIQUE, the Infante. ENRIQUE. Give me your hand, my lord. KING. Infante, How do you find yourself? ENRIQUE. Quite well; Content, my liege, if I but find you In the good health that I enjoy:â And now, my lord, permit my asking For Don ArÃ­as .... KING. He, I know, Has the privilege of your friendship; Free him from prison then, and thou Make them again be friends, Enrique, Since 'tis to you they owe their lives. [Exit. ENRIQUE. May thine own by Heaven be guarded Until thou makest even of time A never-ending bright inheritance! Don Diego will please to go To the tower, and to the Alcaide, And command him, hither to bring Both his prisoners. [Exit Don Diego. The heavens give me Patience under misfortunes like these,â And prudence amid so many evils: Coquin, I perceive you are here. COQUIN. I would be better away in Flanders. ENRIQUE. Why? COQUIN. The king is a prodigy 'Mong all the animals on the earth. ENRIQUE. How? COQUIN. Because indulgent Nature Doth permit the bull to bellow, The lion to roarâthe ox to lowâ The ass to brayâthe bird to warbleâ The dog to barkâthe cat to mewâ The horse to indulge himself in neighingâ The wolf to howl, and the pig to grunt, But man alone it only permitteth To laugh, and Aristotle thus, As the most perfect definition, Calls him the laughing animal:â But the king, 'gainst the order of nature, And sometimes of art, doth never laugh. Grant me, Heaven, to draw but one chuckle Out of his throat, the pincers of wit! Enter DON GUTIERRE, DON ARÃAS, and DON DIEGO. DIEGO. Behold, my lord, I bring to thee The prisoners. GUTIERRE. Thy feet we kiss. ARÃAS. You raise us to the skies by this. ENRIQUE. The king, my gracious lord, to me Has given, what with humility I asked for, both your lives to-day: Once more be mutual friends, I pray. GUTIERRE. Thus honour is conferred by thee. [He perceives that the sword of the prince is of the same design as the dagger which he found in Mencia's apartment.] But what is this, O God! I see? [Aside. ENRIQUE. Shake hands. ARÃAS. Behold I lead the way, Here then is mine. GUTIERRE. And mine: all traces Of our late difference now must lie Hid 'neath the friendly knot we tie, 'Till death the twisted bond displaces. ARÃAS. And may these mutual embraces Confirm the friendships that they show. ENRIQUE. It gladdens me that this is so:â As cavaliers the strife begun, As cavaliers you both have done All that nice honour bade you do:â 'Tis therefore right that you should be True friends, and he who now will dare This to deny, had best prepare In deadly fight to answer me. GUTIERRE. The friendships which, my lord, for thee I now rewaken, must endure, I my obedience shall procure, Nor can I doubt that you will give This crowning honour, to believe That of me you may be sure:â A potent enemy are you, And leaving loyalty apart, Fear were enough to keep my heart From breaking what it swore to do:â You and I 'gainst some other two, Oh! 'twere delightful then to show To all the world, how well I know Obedient to my word to be;â But with you for an enemyâ Oh! who would dare to venture?âwho?â So much would fear my senses scareâ So strangely darken and control My cautious and attentive soul, That it would not have power to dare To look at you:âIf unaware My sword should ever cross with thine, Such fearful instinct shall be mine, Such terror shall o'ercloud mine eyesâ That I must fail to recognise Your grace, though noontide's sun may shine. ENRIQUE, aside. In those hints and sighs I trace The clearest marks of jealousy:â Come! Don ArÃ­as, I with thee [Aloud. Have business in another place. DON ARÃAS. I attend upon thy grace. [Exeunt Don Enrique, Don Diego, and Don ArÃ­as. GUTIERRE, alone. Enrique answered naught, and so Even by his silence he doth show My fear is not an idle guess:â Can I bewail my grief?âah, yes! But to console my anguish, no:â I am now alone, and therefore Can commune with my own mind:â Is there one, O God! that knoweth To reduce to one discourseâ Or to heal with one idea Such a numerous host of evilsâ Such a progeny of pain, That in coward crowds assail meâ That in daring troops surround:â Now, oh! now's the moment, valour, That the soul its wail repeating, Tombed in burning tears and sighs, Cometh to the open portals Of the soul, which are the eyes:â And indeed, on this occasion, Eyes, you fitly melt in weeping, That you may wash out my shame!â Now, my valour, now's the moment, You can prove how well you know For the curing of my honour To call prudence to thy aid: But a truce to barren feeling, Forced by honour, forced by valour, I must not thus weakly yield me Up to mere complaints and sighs; He but dallies with his grievance Who but asks for its redress;â Let me first think o'er the matterâ It, perchance, can be explained: Oh! I ask of God to grant it, Would to God it may be so!â 'Tis true, last night, when unexpected, I went home,âbut then the doors Opened quickly, and in quiet Found I there my tranquil wife. Then the sudden exclamation That a man was in the house,â Strange, no doubt, but still remember That 'twas she who told me so:â But the light, too, was extinguishedâ Yes, but still what proof have I That, indeed, it did not happen Through an actual accident?â Next, the question of this daggerâ It is possible it may Have been left there by a servant, And although (oh! woe is me!) In its fashion, it resembles Closely the Infante's sword, Other swords it may resemble, As the form is not so strange But a thousand more may have it: Deeper let me sift the matter, And confess (ah! me) that it Was the Infante'sânay, even further, That he was himself there hid, Though my hot eyes could not see him; But supposing all this true, Still may Mencia be guiltless? Gold, that magic master-key, In the bribed hand of a servant Opens wide the closest doors:â Oh! how glad I am for having Found this subtle argument;â So, abridging our reflections, Let us make the points converge Thus, that Mencia is Mencia, And that I am who I am;â Nothing could a moment tarnish Light like hers so bright and pure; If I thought so, it were error,â Then a cloud could stain the sun, Which it dulls not, though it troubleth, Nor eclipses, though it chills:â What unrighteous law would punish Innocence with pains and death?â But still, honour, thou'rt in danger, There is not an hour but may Bring the crisis on: thou'rt living In thy sepulchre, sustained By a woman's breath, and treading On the edge of thine own grave:â I have now to cure thee, honour: First, the symptoms clearly show How excessive is the danger; Let the first prescription be To prevent all new infection, And to drive the old one forth:â So the Physician of his Honour Thus prescribeth and ordains, First, the sparing diet of silence, To keep cool both tongue and mouth By the gentle aid of patience. Which doth mean, that you apply To your wife all soft endearments, Kindness, fondness, friendship, love, Flatteries too, which are a powerful Safeguard, that the fell disease May not grow the more through harshness For contentions and displeasures, Insults, jealousies, suspicions, As indeed they ought to do, Ever give unto a woman The disease they meant to cure. I to-night shall seek my dwelling, Secretly shall enter there, To examine more minutely The disease, and while inquiring, To dissemble, if I can, This misfortune, this affliction, This extremity, this wrong, This offence, this aggravation, This amazement, this delirium, This oppression, this affront, Finally, this jealousyâ Jealousy! what have I uttered? Badly, madly uttered:âback! Back! again into my bosom Fly that venom'd word! but no;â For if it indeed be poison That's engendered in my breastâ Since it did not kill in coming, It might kill in going back. As 'tis written of the viper, That it dies by its own poison If outside itself it meets it:â Said I jealousy? Oh! said I Jealousy? It is enough! When, alas! a wretched husband Comes to know that he is jealous, Science then is unavailing, Then remains the final cure To be tried, to be applied by The Physician of his Honour! [Exit. SCENE IV. âTHE HOUSE OF DOÃA LEONORE. Enter DON ARÃAS and DOÃA LEONORE. ARÃAS. Do not think, fair Leonore, That I meant not to come nigh thee, Thereby meaning to deny thee The great debt that, o'er and o'er, Claims thy honour: no, I plead Even its magnitude, the better To explain why I, thy debtor (Not to pay the debt indeed), Have but now before thee come; For 'twere folly, desperation, To expect such obligation Could be paid by any sum:â Though I cannot pay the debt Of atonement that I owe thee, Still I venture here, to show thee My repentance and regret. LEONORE. SeÃ±or, I must at once declare I feel obliged for this, though you, In the account betwixt us two, Have scarcely struck the balance fair; Though you deprived me, I confess, Of a fond lover that I loved, Still, the blessing you removed May have increased my happiness Since it is better lose even lifeâ Honour, fame, and reputation, Than to assume the hapless station Of an abhorred and hated wife. I blame my destinyânot thee;â 'Tis true I feel a lasting pain, But then I only must complain Of evil stars. ARÃAS. This must not be: No, beauteous Leonore, to take This fault from me, is to remove The chance of telling thee the love I long have cherished for thy sake. Then in the briefest, simplest way Let me declare, nor thou reprove me, That 'tis thy love that now doth move me To come with trembling lips to say, That since I have occasioned thee So many griefs, such sorrows costâ If a spouse through me you lost,â Accept a husband now through me. LEONORE. SeÃ±or, with reason do I feel The motive that compels thee now, At such a moment, to avow The choice your flattering words reveal; But though I prize this act of thine, You will permit me to reply Respectfully, SeÃ±or, that I Your courteous offer must decline; For, though it were, at any time, An honour, still, as you have said, Through you was Gutierre led To think me guilty of a crime Against love's laws, and if he saw Me married unto you, this fact Following the former fancied act Would proof from mere suspicion draw. It were but wantonness to tempt The censure of the world; so clear The demonstration would appear That I deserved its deep contempt: No, I shall never yield the strong Just privilege of complaint, that they Who blame me now should have to say I gave occasion for my wrong. Then would the guilty party fill The place from which the guiltless fellâ No one must think he acted well, Who as I know did act so ill. ARÃAS. This reply of yours doth prove, Fair Leonore, quite frivolous, Since though it clearly proved 'tween us The existence of an ancient love, It, at the same time, blotteth out The slightest shadow of a stain; But see how worse you will remain If he who now thy truth doth doubt, Will still doubt on, and ne'er discover The reparation that thy heart Refuses? LEONORE. It is not the part Of a wise or prudent lover, Don ArÃ­as, to advise What I feel is for my ruin; For, the wrong that he is doing, Naught can alter or undo; Nay 'twere even worse, since he From doubt would rise to certainty. As little were it right in you To act thus either. ARÃAS. As for me, I, from my full confidence In your bosom's innocence, Ever satisfied will be; In my life, I never knew Any jaundiced jealous lover Who in trifles could discover Gravest faults, when married too, That the Heavens did not chastise:â Gutierre, Leonore, Can on this point tell thee more, He whose overwatchful eyes, On a stranger's dwelling thrown, Could a man detect, and be Outraged so, had better see What is passing in his own. LEONORE. Don ArÃ­as, I cannot hear This falsehood or this bold untruthâ Don Gutierre is in sooth The model of a cavalier, One who knows on all occasions How to live and how to die, Making word and act comply With his knightly obligations. He, a man whose strong bright steel, Whose sense of right as bright and strong, Would ne'er have borne the slightest wrong From an Infante of Castile; If you thought by this address Me to flatter, and awaken Base revenge, you are mistaken:â Nay, if I the truth confess, You have lost your chance of me. If a noble nature's token You possess'd, you ne'er had spoken In this way of your enemy;â For though such my indignation For his doubting me, I could Wash out my insult in his blood, A disloyal imputation 'Gainst his honour wounds me still. Even for vengeance, time doth tell, He who loveth once and well Never seeks the lov'd one's ill. [Exit. ARÃAS. I know not what reply to make: In honour's schools it is confess'd Woman's tongue can argue best, I'm convinced by my mistake. To the prince I shall direct Now my steps, and humbly pray That in his pursuits he may Hence some other friend select. Lo! his beams the day doth bury Tombed within the western main. I shall die ere I again Seek the house of Gutierre. [Exit. SCENE V. âTHE GARDEN OF DON GUTIERRE'S VILLA BY NIGHT, AS IN THE FORMER SCENE. DOÃA MENCIA IS SEEN RECLINING UPON A COUCH ASLEEP, BESIDE HER IS A TABLE WITH A LIGHTED LAMP UPON IT. DON GUTIERRE IS SEEN DESCENDING FROM THE GARDEN-WALL, WHICH HE HAS CLIMBED. GUTIERRE. In the mute silence of this breathless night, Which fills my breast with terror and delightâ Whose dusky shades, and glimmering stars, at strife, Build the dark sepulchre of human life, Here to my house in secret have I comeâ Here I approach to Mencia and to home. No tidings of my freedom reached her ear, Lest (woe is me!) she should expect me here. I call myself, Physician of my Honour, Since I procure the cure of my dishonour. And so I come, my visit here to pay, At the same hour I did on yesterday, To see if jealousy's sharp, sudden pain Hath left the patient, or doth still remain. For this I've leapt the garden's barrier o'er, Lest I be seen when entering the door. Oh God! what falsehood doth the whole world taint, That no man dare examine his complaint, Without the danger of perpetual fears! Badly he spoke who said, the wretch has tears To shed for his misfortunes. 'Tis untrue That he who feels the jealous shaft pierce through His heart can e'er be silent thereupon. It may be, that that man has never known What 'twas to feel that agony of pain; But knowing that, he must perforce complain. This is the place, within whose cool retreat She loves at night to rest; and though the feet Make no sharp echo 'neath those boughs of gloom, Let us tread gently, Honour, since we've come. For prying thus, beneath o'ershadowing leaves, Oft jealous men must use the step of thieves. [He sees Mencia sleeping. Ah! fairest Menciaâah! my gentle dove, Badly you meet my constancy and love! Another time I will return again; My honour I find well, and freed from pain. Now that 'tis so, it needs no other cure, And in its health I feel myself secure. Butânot a slave attends upon her hereâ Perhaps she watcheth for some stranger near;â O, slanderous breath! vile terror! cruel thought! Still this suspicion chains me to the spot, And, till by sifting it, it pass away, Here must my doubting footsteps lingering stay. The light I quench, and treading through the night, [Extinguishes the light. Come doubly blind, bereft of sense and light. My voice, too, sinks its usual pitch beneath; And thus I whisper, with my gentlest breathâ Mencia! [Awakes her. MENCIA. My God! Who's there? GUTIERRE. My love, speak low. MENCIA. Who's there? GUTIERRE. 'Tis I. And does my life not know? MENCIA. Ah! yes, my lord, no other would have dared...... GUTIERRE. She knows me, then. What agony is spared! [Aside. MENCIA. To venture here. If any one but you Did dare so much, this hour I would imbrue My hands in the hot blood that warms his frame, Defending thus my honour and my name. GUTIERRE, aside. Oh! joyâhow sweetly am I undeceived! Well does he act who probes where he is grieved. Mencia, dear Mencia, do not now persist [Aloud. In fear. MENCIA. How badly, terror, I resist The feeling! GUTIERRE. Ever in my heart shall live Your worth. MENCIA. Say what excuse, thou now shalt give?...... GUTIERRE. None. MENCIA. For your highness daring to come here? GUTIERRE, aside. Highness! Oh God, what word is this I hear? She knows me not. I struggle once again With doubt, misfortune, misery, and pain! MENCIA. Would'st thou a second time behold my death? Think'st thou each night...... GUTIERRE, aside. I gaspâI faint for breath! MENCIA. Thou canst conceal thyself? GUTIERRE, aside. O Heavens! MENCIA. And by Extinguishing the light...... GUTIERRE, aside. Now let me die! MENCIA. At my extremest peril, from this place Escape before Don Gutierre's face? GUTIERRE, aside. I doubt my own existence, since I live; And that my breath her death-stroke doth not give. She does not chide the prince for being here: No coyness doth she feel, but only fear, Lest he, perchance (oh! bitter, bitter pain), Should be compelled to hide himself again! Oh! let my heart be firm, my hand be strong, To make my vengeance equal to my wrong! MENCIA. My lord, I pray your highness to retire. GUTIERRE, aside. Oh! God, I feel myself all rageâall fire! MENCIA. Risk not again your safety, I implore. GUTIERRE, aside. Who for such care but would return once more? MENCIA. This hour, Don Gutierre I expect. GUTIERRE, aside. Who would not now all patience quite reject? Ah! only he who waits a fitting time, To wreak his vengeance, and to punish crime!â He will not come. I left him late to-day, [Aloud. Engaged in business. By the public way, A friend of mine doth keep a strict look-out; He will not come unnoticed, do not doubt. Enter JACINTA. JACINTA, aside. Trembling I come to see who speaketh here. MENCIA. Methinks I hear some footsteps drawing near. GUTIERRE. What shall I do? MENCIA. Retire, retire, your grace, Not to my chamber, but some other place. [Don Gutierre retires to the back of the stage. JACINTA. My lady! MENCIA. The cool air that trembling crept Amid these whispering branches, while I slept, Blew out the lamp: you may again retire And bring a light. [Jacinta goes into the house. GUTIERRE, aside. Enkindled in my fire!â If I remain here, when the light is shown She must behold me, and then all is known,â Because then Mencia will know And understand my soul's overwhelming woe. This can not be, I must at any price Prevent the pang of being offended twice, Once by the intent, And once by the thought I knew, and could consent Her well-earned death one moment to delay, So I must needs dissemble in this way:â [He advances and continues in a loud voice, Ho! how is this? What, no one from the whole Household attends!â MENCIA, aside. Rejoice, my coward soul, 'Tis Gutierre, not the dreaded fate You feared. GUTIERRE. No lamp lit yet, and it so late! Enter JACINTA with a light. DON GUTIERRE advances as if from the garden-gate. JACINTA. Here is the light. GUTIERRE. Ah! Mencia, my dear wife! MENCIA. My husband! joy and glory of my life! GUTIERRE, aside. Her false caresses strike my bosom chill, But heart and soul we must dissemble still. MENCIA. How did you enter, my dear lord? GUTIERRE. This key Through the small garden-gate admitted me; My love! my life! but tell me how You here enjoy yourself? MENCIA. I came but now Down to this garden, where the winds of night, Cooled by these fountains, have blown out the light. GUTIERRE. I do not wonder at it, darling mine, Because the air that killed this light of thine Was breath'd out by a zephyr wild and bold, And then ran circling round so icy cold That, of this, you need have little doubt, Not lights alone, but lives it could blow out. Had you slept then, my wife, Its poisoned breath might have destroyed your life. MENCIA. I wish to understand you, but I find Your thoughts too subtle, or too dull my mind. GUTIERRE. Have you not seen a burning flame expire, Struck by the air, and quenched before your eyes, Which, by the embers of another fire, Is soon relit, while that which lights it dies? Thus death and life the quick combustion finds, And so the flattering tongue of wanton winds May kill the light with thee, And, the same moment, kindle it for me. MENCIA. 'Tis plain, your words two meanings must conceal. Can it be jealousy, my lord, you feel? GUTIERRE, aside. Too soon my sorrows to my lips arise,â But then the jealous never yet were wise;â Jealousy? Know you then what jealousy is? [Aloud. As the Heavens live! I know no pang like this,â For if I could, from any reason, know What jealousy was .... MENCIA, aside. Alas! O bitter woe! GUTIERRE. If I had grounds to fancy what may be This phantom terror you call jealousyâ That it were more than a mere dream of night That some poor slave or handmaid doth affright, Whoe'er the object, I would cruelly tear Out bit by bit the warm heart she doth bear; Then as the quivering fragments came Reeking with blood and liquefied in flame, I would the red drops as they fell, Drink with delight and eat the heart as well;â Nay, her very soul I forth would snatch, Which with a thousand wounds I would despatch, If souls, by pain, can e'er be visitÃ©d:â But heavens! what words are these my lips have said? MENCIA. You overwhelm my trembling heart with fear. GUTIERRE. O God! O God! my Mencia, Mencia dear! My good, my wife,âthe glory of my skies! Dear mistress mine, oh! pardon by thine eyes This wild disorder, this strange burst of grief, Which past conception, past all sane belief, A mere chimera of the brain did cause, Making my thoughts o'erleap all natural laws; But by thy life, I swear to thee, my dear, I still look on thee with respect and fear, Yes, notwithstanding this my strange offence:â Heavens! how I must have been bereft of sense! MENCIA, aside. Fear, terror, dread, as if with poisoned breath Breathe o'er my soul the pestilence of death. GUTIERRE. I called myself Physician of my Honour. And in the earth shall bury my dishonour. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA HALL IN THE ROYAL PALACE. Enter the KING and his attendants, among whom is DON GUTIERRE, who advances. GUTIERRE. Pedro, the footsteps of whose throne Are bathed by India's sun-bright sea, Alone I wish to speak with thee. KING to his attendants, who retire. Retire awhile: I am alone. GUTIERRE. Apollo of this Spanish zoneâ Castilian Atlas, unto thee, To whose strong shoulders, constantly The mighty destiny is given To bear the sapphire orb of heaven, The diamond globe and pearly sea,â To thee I come to lay the prize Of life before thy feet, if I Can call that life which seems to die Each moment, stifled in my sighsâ Wonder not then, my lord, these eyes Of mine are neither cold nor dry: 'Tis said that they whose bosoms prove Worthy to feel the joys of love, Or those of honour, still more deepâ Have the proud privilege to weep Their sorrows, and no man reprove:â Honour and love have both been mineâ Honour which I have always worn As being a noble and well born;â And love, which lately thou didst twine My marriage, in those bonds of thine: Thus rich by gain and inheritance, I saw my happy days advance, Till clouds that envied such a life, Darken'd such splendour in my wifeâ Such lustre in my confidence:â But now my tongue can scarce evince The cause of so much sorrow. Since He against whom my wrong demands Justice and rigour at thy hands, Is your own brotherâeven the prince:â Not that he may learn, dread sire, That outraged honour in its ire Knows not how to pause or cower, Even in the regal front of powerâ To him who feels that sacred fire The bare conception will suffice:â And so I hope by your advice Life for my honour to procure, And that prevention more than cure May heal the anguish in a trice:â For if I could, before I heal it, From bad to worse increasing feel it, Then would my wrath, in wilder mood, Wash out the shameful stain in blood,â And deep within the earth conceal it:â Start not! the blood that I shall seek, Must only trickle from this breast:â Of Don Enrique be at restâ On him no vengeance shall I wreak,â Of that, this witness here shall speakâ This brilliant tongue of glittering steelâ This dagger which I now reveal, Was his: ah! judge how safe is he, When even his dagger trusts to me The proud Infante of Castile! KING. Say no more, Don Gutierre, For the man that Honour crowns Every hour with never-vanquished Garlands of respect and love,â Garlands that in brightness rival Even the rays of the sunâmay live Satisfied his honour...... GUTIERRE. Do not, Please your majesty, my lord, Make me think that you imagine I have need to be consoled Ere my own good name I credit:â Oh! I have a wife so honest, Chaste and firm, she leaves behind Roman Portia and Lucretia, Scythian Thomyris: I ask But precautions. KING. Still precautions Prove some danger threatens near; What then saw you, Gutierre? GUTIERRE. Nothing, since men formed as I Do not seeâenough they fancy,â Dream, foreshadow, or suspect, Feel some instinctâsome diviningâ Some......I know not what to say:â For no word could give the meaning Of what I have felt and feelâ Feelings that resemble atomsâ Too minute to analyze:â I your majesty consulted, But for this one cause aloneâ To avoid a threatened evil, Not an actual one to cure; Had it happened, you may trust me, I myself would have prescribed Remedies, instead of asking Tardy cures at others' hands. KING. Since you call yourself Physician Of your Honour, Gutierre, Tell me what remedial measures Have you taken up to this? GUTIERRE. Not a jealous word I've uttered To my wife, but every moment Seemed to love her more and more. In a sweet and peaceful villa Some leagues off she lately lived: Thinking that, perchance, the lonely Place might have a sad effect, I to Seville moved my household, And she now resideth here, Where she now no more need envy Those who share its gaieties, For harsh treatment and reproaches Are but used by common husbandsâ Who when they have told their insults Lose all further fear of them. KING. The Infante hither cometh; If he sees you here, 'tis certain That he will from that discover You have told me your complaints: But I call to mind another Day, when one in mournful accents Made the like complaints of theeâ How behind some flowing curtains I concealed on that occasion Her who made me those complaints; And as similar diseases Call for corresponding treatment, Let it be repeated here, As with you I am desirous Now to do what then I did; But be sure let nothing tempt you To come forth, whate'er is said. GUTIERRE. Oh! my lord, thus humbly bending, At your royal feet I kneel: I will be the bird depicted With a pebble in its bill. [Conceals himself. Enter the Infante DON ENRIQUE. KING. Just in time you come, Enrique, Evil though the time may prove, Since you find me...... ENRIQUE, aside. Oh! I tremble!â KING. Full of wrath. ENRIQUE. My gracious lord! Say with whom? what crime compels thee? KING. With yourself, Infanteâyou. ENRIQUE. Then my life will be unhappy If the sun that was its glory Leaves it dead in dark eclipse. KING. Are you not aware, Enrique, More than once a sword has wash'd out Private wrongs in royal blood? ENRIQUE. For what end, my lord, what purpose Asks your majesty? KING. For you, You yourself, it is I ask it: Honour is a sacred place Which the soul alone inhabitsâ I am not the king of souls,â Saying this I've said sufficient. ENRIQUE. Still I understand you not. KING. If your love shows no amendment, From this very moment ceasing Vain impracticable efforts To obtain a certain beauty Whom a noble vassal's bosom Loves with lawful sovereign sway, Not our mutual blood shall save you From my justice and my wrath. ENRIQUE. Though, my lord, your slightest precept Is a law your tongue impresses On my heart, as if 'twere written In the ever-during bronzeâ Hear at least my exculpation. Never should it be forgotten That a judge's equal ears Should be open to both parties:â Yes, my lord, I loved a ladyâ For I know of whom you speak,â Loved her well on slight foundationâ In a word, my lord, I loved her To the extent...... KING. And what imports it, If she is beyond thy reach? ENRIQUE. True indeed, but then...... KING. Be silent. ENRIQUE. Will you not, my lord, permit me Offer an excuse? KING. There's none, Since she is a peerless beauty Without blemish. ENRIQUE. Beyond doubt: But as time doth conquer all things, Love may triumph over all. KING, aside. God! how badly have I acted In concealing Gutierre!â Silence! silence!â ENRIQUE. Oh! incite thee Not against me, knowing not What has driven me on to act so. KING. Nay, I know it all right well:â What a terrible position! [Aside. ENRIQUE. 'Tis my right, my lord, to speak: Yes, I loved her when a maidenâ Who by that is injured?âsay,â Ere a vassal...... GUTIERRE, aside. Ah! unhappy! ENRIQUE. Took this lady as his wifeâ I...... KING. You must not dare to tell me: Silence! silence! since I know You have feigned some wild chimera Merely to excuse thy fault.â Come Infante, come Infante, Let us put an end to thisâ Tell me, do you know this dagger? ENRIQUE. On returning to the palace Late one night, I found that I Had it not. KING. And then you know not Where it was that it was lost? ENRIQUE. No, my lord. KING. I do: 'twere easy Where 'twas found to have enstained it With the best blood of your breast, If he was not, he who found it, The most true and loyal vassal Ever owned by prince or king:â See you not what noble vengeance Seeks the man, who though offended Thus surrenders arms and breast? Do you see the gold inlaying Of this dagger's glittering blade? 'Tis an hieroglyph that speaketh Your offence; of you it comes To complain, and I must hear it:â Take its bright steel from the sheath And look on it; there, Enrique, You will see your faults. ENRIQUE. My lord, Think, that in your wrath you treat me So severely, that disturbed...... KING. Take the dagger. [Enrique takes the dagger, but in his confusion wounds the king's hand.] Ah! what mean you, Traitor? ENRIQUE. I? KING. What! with my blood Will you thus your steel ensanguine? Thou, the dagger which I gave thee Wilt thou turn against my breast? Do you then desire to kill me? ENRIQUE. Think, my lord, of what you say, So confused am I...... KING. So daring Even to me?âHold! hold, Enrique, Turn its point away!âI die! ENRIQUE. Such a mournful misconception!â It is best I now retire And withdraw me from thy presence Even for life, that you again Ne'er may form the dread delusion That I meant to shed thy blood:â I a thousand times unhappy! [Flings the dagger from him and exit. KING. Heaven defend me! what is this? What intolerable terror! Bathed I saw me in my bloodâ Dead I seemed!âWhat dismal fancy Darkly circled me around, With its horror-folding phantoms, And with icy weight lay heavy On my frozen heart and soul!â God I ask, that these beginnings May not come to such an end, That with bloody inundations All the world be not amazed! The historical reader need scarcely be reminded, that Don Pedro's presentiments were not without good cause, he having been eventually slain by the hand of his half brother Henry of Trastamaraâthe Don Enrique of this drama. [Exit. GUTIERRE, advancing. Such a wonder is this day!â So made up of dread surprises, It is but a trifling matter That the king forgot me here, Ah! what words were those that reached me? But why speak then with the tongue, When my wrong can be but measured By the miseries of my life?â Let me then tear up the hapless Root of so much woe at once:â Mencia must die, and purple With her blood her bridal bed!â And since now this fatal dagger Gives to me, a second time, The Infante, with this weapon Must the fatal deed be done: [Takes up the dagger. But 'twere wrong to make it public, Since I know that secrecy Ever gains the proudest conquests, And an outrage which is secret Doth demand a like revenge: Mencia indeed must perish, But the cause must not be knownâ Ere the fatal moment cometh, Heaven in pity take my life! That I may not see the tragic End of so much hapless love!â Why, transparent fields of azure, Why reserve your lightning bolts?â Is it not full time to hurl them Downâwith burning points transfixing Him who'll thank thee for the stroke?â Skies too tranquil and too cloudless, Have ye not a death to give To a being so unhappy?â Not one flash for such a wretch? [Exit. SCENE II. âA ROOM IN DON GUTIERRE'S HOUSE, IN SEVILLE. Enter DOÃA MENCIA and JACINTA. JACINTA. SeÃ±ora, what deep source of sadness Darkens thy beauty and denies thee gladness, That day and night you can do naught but weep? MENCIA. The anguish that o'erwhelms me is so deep, So full of doubtful terror, no allusion Can ope this dark confusion on confusion, Or this phantom fear dismember:â Since that doleful night, if you remember, When at our country-house residing, I, Jacinta, unto thee confiding My secret troubles, came and told to thee, How Don Enrique spoke but then to me, When (I know not how my grief to tell) You said that that was quite impossibleâ For at the time I said he spoke to me He in another quarter spoke to thee: I am sad and tearful, Doubtful, distracted, timorous and fearfulâ Thinking it must necessarily be Gutierre who did speak to me. JACINTA. Could such an error happen thee without Thy knowing? MENCIA. Yes, Jacinta, now I cannot doubt,â 'Twas night and in low whispering words he spoke, Frightened and in confusion I awoke, And thinking 'twas the prince's voice I heard, Easily the mistake might have occurred.â Besides to see him smile and hear him groan, Joyful with me and weeping when alone,â The prey of troubles and dark jealousies Which make such fatal friendship with the eyes, That from them they nothing can concealâ All make my heart foreboding terrors feel. Enter COQUIN. COQUIN. SeÃ±ora. MENCIA. Well, what message do you bear? COQUIN. To tell its purport I can scarcely dare,â Don Enrique the Infante...... MENCIA. Coquin, ceaseâ No more that name shall scare my bosom's peace, No more shall waken my scarce slumbering woe, So much I fear it and abhor it so. COQUIN. The message that I bear thee do not fear, 'Tis not of love. MENCIA. In that case I shall hear; Say on. COQUIN. SeÃ±ora, the Infanteâwho Was so bootlessly in love with you, Had to-day a serious altercation With the king, his brother; the narration Should you perchance demand it I cannot tell, as I don't understand it,â And if I did, among forbidden things With jesters, is the sacred talk of kings,â This by the way:âEnrique summoned me, And thus addressed me with great secrecy:â To DoÃ±a Mencia speedily depart, And bear this message to her on my part,â Tell her that her tyrannous disdain From me the favour of the king hath ta'en, And drives me from my native land, A mourning exile, to a foreign strandâ Where every hope of life shall fly, Since there, by Mencia hated, I shall die. MENCIA. What! must the prince, the favour of the king, And even his country, lose through me?âa thing To strike the proudest reputation down!â Oh! I shall be the babble of the town!â What shall I do? O Heavens!â JACINTA. Be sure, My lady, it is better to prevent than cure This evil. COQUIN. Yes, how can she? pray explain JACINTA. By asking the Infante to remain:â For if on thy account he leaves this place, As now is whispered, thy unjust disgrace Will be made publicâsince whate'er compels A prince's absence, rumour ever tells With added circumstance and sateless zest The why and wherefore. COQUIN. How shall this request Come to his ears, if off in thought he flies Booted and spurred, and bearing countless sighs? JACINTA. By my lady writing to him now A letter which will simply tell him how Her reputation doth require that he Go not away: and if brought back by thee Will reach him in full time. MENCIA. Alas! although To palter with one's honour is, I know, A dangerous experimentâto me The writing of this letter seems to be The only hopeful thing that I can do;â And if an ill, the lesser ill of two,â If any ill of mine can be called light:â Both here remain, while I go in and write. [She draws a curtain aside, and enters an adjoining apartment. The curtain closes behind her.] JACINTA. Coquin, how comes it that from day to day You grow more sadâyou once so light and gay? Say, what can be the sudden cause of it? COQUIN. Why, I attempted to become a wit, For my misfortune, and have got all over A hypochondria I'll ne'er recover. JACINTA. A hypochondria? and what is that? COQUIN. 'Tis an infirmity the sick world gat A year or two ago, unknown beforeâ 'Tis one of fashion's fevers and no more;â From which, fair friend, no lady can excuse her, Or should she catch it not, to him who wooes her, She mourning comes, and says to him some day, Bestow a little hypochondria:â But my master enters now the room. JACINTA. My God!âI fly to tell her he has come. Enter DON GUTIERRE. GUTIERRE. Hold! hold, Jacinta, stay! Why do you fly my presence in this way? JACINTA. I meant but quickly to proclaim Unto my lady, that your lordship came Into the house. GUTIERRE, aside. O race of servants! ye The fostered foes of every family!â They seem perplexed by my abrupt intrusion:â Come, tell me what's the cause of this confusion? Why would you so have fled? [To Jacinta. JACINTA. My lord, I meant to announce, as I have said, Your coming to my mistress. GUTIERRE, aside. She doth seal Her lipsâperchance this other may reveal The truth:âYou Coquin, as you are aware, Have been my trusted servant firm and fastâ Be now obedient to my earnest prayerâ Tell me, good God! quick, tell me what has pass'd? COQUIN. My lord, I'd grieve if I but knew a tittle That I had learned and could reveal so littleâ Please God! my master...... GUTIERRE. Do not speak so high:â Why were you so disturbed, when I came nigh? COQUIN. We're easily frightenedâboth our nerves are weak. GUTIERRE, aside. With signs, I see them to each other speak; No feeble cowardice must now be shown:â Both of you leave me. [Exeunt Coquin and Jacinta. Now we are alone, My honour, you and I, we now must go At once to end my rapture or my woe:â Who ever saw a grief like this arise That hands must kill while tears bedew the eyes! [He draws the curtain, and Mencia is seen writing at a tableâher back is towards him.] Mencia is writing; I am driven to see To whom she writes, and what the theme may be: [He advances cautiously and seizes the letter; Mencia starts up and with a sudden exclamation faints away.] MENCIA. O God! O Heaven! assist me in my woe! GUTIERRE. She lies a living statue of cold snow!â [Reads. âI pray your highnessââAh! since he is high, Low on the ground, my honour thou must lie!â âDo not departâ ......No more my voice impart This hated prayer that he should not depart:â So freely now I yield me to my fate, I almost thank my woes they are so great!â But shall I now her senseless body slay? No, I must act in a more cautious wayâ First all my servants I must send elsewhere, That then companioned only by my care Alone I stay: And she, my hapless wife, Whom more than all in my unhappy life I truly lovedâI now desire in this Final farewellâthis trembling o'er the abyss Of death and judgmentâshe should feel once more My care, my pity ere her life be o'erâ That latest care affection's zeal supplies,â That the soul die not when the body dies. [He writes some lines upon the letter, which he places upon the table, and then leaves the apartment.] MENCIA, recovering. Oh! avert! avert! thy vengeful sword!â Think me not guilty, my beloved lord,â For Heaven doth know that I die innocent! What furious hand! what bloody steel is bent To pierce my heart! Oh! hold!âthy wrath assuage, Nor slay an innocent woman in thy rage;â But how is this? Ah! me, I am alone, And is he gone? hath Gutierre flown?â Methoughtâand who would not have thought with me? Dying I sank amid a ruby sea:â O God! this fainting, when I gasped for breath, Was the foreshadow of impending death!â The illusive truth I doubt and yet believe!â This letter I shall tear. [She takes up the letter. But what do I perceive? Some writing of my husband placed beneath,â I feel it is the sentence of my death! [Reads. âLove adores thee, but honour abhors thee; and thus while one condemns thee to death, the other gives thee this admonition: thou hast but two hours to liveâthou art a Christian,âsave thy soul, for as to thy life it is impossible.â O God, defend me! ho! Jacinta, here! No one replies, another fatal fear!â Is there no servant waiting? I shall know.â Ah! me, the door is locked, I cannot go: No one in all the house appears to hear meâ Terror and horror shuddering come more near me! These windows too are barred with iron railings, In vain to vacant space I utter my bewailingsâ Since underneath an outstretch'd garden lies, Where there is none to heed my frantic criesâ Where shall I go? O whither shall I fly, Girt by those shades of death that darken heart and eye! [Scene closes. SCENE III. âA STREET IN SEVILLE.âNIGHT. Enter the KING and DON DIEGO. KING. Has Enrique then departed? DIEGO. Yes, my lord, he went this morning Forth from Seville. KING. I believe, that With an arrogant presumption, He imagined that he only Could of all the world, defy me:â And he went.....? DIEGO. To Consuegra, I presume. KING. What! to the Infante The Grand-Master there? their union Will result in plotting vengeance Against me. DIEGO. They are your brothers: As their brother they must love thee, As their king they must respectâ Bound by double bonds of nature To obey thee. KING. And Enrique Bringeth whom as his companion? DIEGO. Don ArÃ­as. KING. His old friend. DIEGO. Down the street there's music sounding. KING. Let us then approach it nearer; What is sung, perchance may gently Calm my mind. DIEGO. Sweet music ever Is an antidote to ills. MUSICIANS sing within. The Infante Don Enrique Took his leave of the king to-day: May God bring to a happy issue Both his grief and his going away. KING. What a mournful voice! Diego, At the street-end intercept them:â He must not escape inquiry Who such dark forebodings sings. [Exeunt at opposite sides. SCENE IV. âA CHAMBER IN DON GUTIERRE'S HOUSE. AT THE BACK SCENE IS AN ANTE-CHAMBER, THE ENTRANCE TO WHICH IS COVERED BY A CURTAIN. Enter DON GUTIERRE, conducting LUDOVICO, a Surgeon, whose eyes are bound. GUTIERRE. Enter without any fear; Now 'tis time that I unfasten From your face this needful bandage, And that I conceal mine own. [He loosens the bandage and conceals his own face in his cloak.] LUDOVICO. God preserve me! GUTIERRE. Be not frightened, Whatsoe'er you see. LUDOVICO. My lord, From my house this night you drew me Forth, but scarcely had we entered On the street, when with a dagger Pointed at my breast, you forced me Tremblingly to do thy bidding, Which was to conceal and cover Up my eyes, and then to yield me To thy guidance, and you led me Onward by a thousand windings, Telling me my life depended On my loosening not the bandage;â Thus an hour I have gone with you Without knowing where I wanderedâ Lost in speechless admiration At so serious an adventure;â But now more disturbed and wondering Do I feel, to find me standing In a house so richly furnishedâ Where there seems no living inmate But yourself, and you, too, hiding Close your face within your mantle:â What's your wish? GUTIERRE. That you await me Here alone for one brief moment. [Goes into the ante-chamber. LUDOVICO. What mysterious termination Can conclude so many wonders? God protect me!â [Don Gutierre comes forth from the chamber, and draws the curtain aside.] GUTIERRE. It is time That you enter here; but listen Ere you do so: this bright dagger Will be instantly enamelled With the best blood of your bosom, If you disobey my orders; Come, and look within this chamber: What do you see in it? LUDOVICO. An image Of pale deathâan outstretch'd body, Which upon a bed is lying:â At each side a lighted candle And a crucifix before it,â Who it is I cannot say, As the face is covered over With a veil of tafeta. GUTIERRE. To this living corseâthis body Which you see, you must give death. LUDOVICO. What are your orders? GUTIERRE. That you bleed herâ Freely let the blood flow forth, Drop by drop the life-stream watchingâ Standing by her purple bed-side Firmly through the horrid scene, Till from out the little puncture She doth sink and bleed to death. Answer not, 'tis vain and useless To attempt to move my pityâ If you wish to live, obey me. LUDOVICO. Oh! my lord, such terror thrills me, Though I hear you, I have not Any strength to do thy bidding. GUTIERRE. He who, forced by sternest fate, Dares discharge so dread a duty, Will know how to kill thee too. LUDOVICO. 'Tis life's instinct that compels me. GUTIERRE. You do well to yield to it, Since the world holds many persons Who but only live to kill:â From this spot I can behold youâ Ludovico, enter in. [Ludovico enters the ante-chamber. This was the most subtle method To dissemble my affrontâ If 'twere poison, it were easy To investigate the causeâ If 'twere by a woundâthe death-mark Never wholly could be hid:â Now, her natural death relating, I can say, a sudden cause Made the bleeding necessary: No one can deny that statement, If it is quite possible For a band itself to loosen:â And to have observed the caution With this man that I have used, Was required: for if uncovered Here he came, and saw a woman Whom he was compelled to bleedâ Then how strong were the presumption:â Now he cannot even say, If he speaks of this adventure, Who the woman was he bled:â And moreover when I bring him Forth some distance from my house, I feel strongly moved to kill him. I, Physician of my Honour, Mean to give it health and life By a bleedingâsince now all things At the cost of blood are cured. [Exit. SCENE V. âTHE STREET. Enter the KING and DON DIEGO at opposite sides. The song is continued by the same voices. MUSICIANS, within. To Consuegra hath departed The Infante of Castileâ Who knows what scenes may yet be acted Among the mountains of Montiel? It was near the Castle of Montiel, in the year 1369, that the tragedy referred to in the preceding note took place. KING. Don Diego! DIEGO. Sire! KING. 'Tis certain They are singing in the street; Shall we not their names discover?â Can it be the wind that speaks? DIEGO. Do not deign, my lord, to notice Idle songs like those we hearâ Since to anger you, no better Can be heard through Seville's streets. KING. Two men are advancing hither. DIEGO. True, we now can have an answer; It to-day may be important To find out who these may be. Enter DON GUTIERRE, conducting LUDOVICO blindfolded as before. GUTIERRE, aside. Ah! that Heaven should interfere, To prevent the sure concealment Of my secret's second key By this wretch's death!â'Tis needful I withdraw me from these twoâ Nothing could be more disastrous Than that they should know me now,â Here I leave him for the present. [Exit. DIEGO. Of the two, my lord, advancing Hither, one has gone, and one Here remains. KING. For my confusion:â Since if I can trust the glimmer Which the pale moon dimly sheds, Shapeless seem its form and featuresâ Rudely sculptured, like a bust Roughly cut from snow-white jasper. DIEGO. Stay, I pray your majesty, I will go to him. KING. Permit me, Don Diego:âMan, thy name? LUDOVICO. Two confusions are the reason Why, my lord, I cannot answer: First, the humbleness of one In my lowly station feeleth At conversing with his king. [Takes off the bandage. By your voice, my lord, I knew youâ It is a light that makes you known Unto every one who hears it:â And the second,âthe most novel, The most wonderful adventure That the archives of the people Chronicle in all their annals. KING. What has happened? LUDOVICO. To you only Will I tell itâcome apart. KING. Yonder wait me, Don Diego. [Ludovico appears to address the king. DIEGO, aside. What surprising circumstances Have I seen this night! May God Draw me from its further dangers! LUDOVICO, in continuation to the king. I saw not the face, but only Heard her mid repeated sobbings Say, âI die in innocenceâ May Heaven ask my life not of you;â This she said and then expired:â Then the man the light extinguished And by all the ways we entered Issued forth again: and hearing As we came along this street, Some one speaking, left me in it:â I forgot, my lord, to mention That my hands bathed red and reeking With the blood he made me shed, I, pretending to support me By the walls, impressed their marks On the doorways as I issued:â By which bloody signs 'tis easy To find out the house. KING. 'Tis well:â Come and tell me when you find it, And whatever else you learn;â Take this diamond ring, present itâ By this token that I give thee, You can enter and have audience With me any hour you come. LUDOVICO. Heaven, my gracious lord, preserve you! [Exit. KING. Don Diego, let us go. DIEGO. What hath happened? KING. An occurrence Stranger than perhaps the world Ever saw. DIEGO. You seem dejected. KING. I must needs indeed be so. DIEGO. Then retire to rest: for morning Now begins to shine amid The golden clouds. KING. I have no power To take rest, until I learn Something that I must discover. DIEGO. Do you not perceive the sun Rises brightly now? your person Will be known. Enter COQUIN. COQUIN. Although you kill me For my having recognised you, O my lord! I must speak with you, Hear me! KING. 'Tis no time for mirth: Why this daring? this distraction? COQUIN. 'Tis an honourable action, Worthy one of nobler birth:â For though classed among the mimes, Jesters, jokers, daft, delirious, Still, my lord, when things grow serious, I am serious, too, at times:â Hear me, 'tis no idle chaff, But the gravest, the most deep, For I wish to make thee weep, Since I failed to make thee laugh:â Gutierre, misinformed By appearances, became So unjust to his good fame As to doubt his wife, and warmed By suspicion, yesterday Found her writing (sad mistake) A request, for honour's sake, To the Infante, that he'd stay Some days longer here, and so Save the breath of scandal blasting Her good name, by falsely casting Blame on her, that he should go:â Guilelessly, without deceit Asked she, as is known to me:â Where she wrote it, noiselessly Gliding in with coward feet, He, the letter seized, and mocked By the words whose sense he missed, Jealously went mad, dismissed All his servants, and then locked Up himself with only her:â I then pitying ('tis but human) To behold a hapless woman Persecuted by her star, Hither come, my lord, to pray thee That your strong and mighty arm Save her from some fatal harm. KING. Tell me how can I repay thee For this pity? COQUIN. Never after This then, claim by act or word The payment of my teeth, my lord. KING. This is not the time for laughter. COQUIN. When then is it? KING. Since the day Now grows bright, and well 'tis soâ Let us, Don Diego, go:â Since I thus the better may Try a plan that I devise: 'Tis this moment to repair To his house, and say that there I would change this night disguise: Being there, whate'er doth seem Then indeed to be the fact, I shall be prepared to act As a king and judge supreme. DIEGO. Better plan was ne'er contrived. COQUIN. While you both have thus been speaking, Here's the house that you are seeking: At the door we have arrived. KING. Don Diego! DIEGO. What do you see? KING. See you not the bloody stain Of a hand on the door? DIEGO. 'Tis plain. KING, aside. Gutierre evidently Is the man to whom belongs This night's unequalled tragedy; How shall I act? Deliberately Hath he satisfied his wrongs. Enter DOÃA LEONORE and INES, veiled. LEONORE. I go to Mass, before the day, In order to avoid the gaze Of people in the public ways Of Seville: that my sorrows may Be quite forgot. But Ines, why Stands that group yonder? 'Tis the King! What to this house his grace can bring? INES. Draw close your veil till we pass by. KING. That precaution is unavailing, Since you are known, fair Leonore. LEONORE. My lord, I drew my thick veil o'er My face, that I might not be failing In my respect: to be unknown, Methought was your desire;âif not, I would, my lord, upon the spot My life before your feet have thrown. KING. Concealment is a thing, by Heaven! Which would have rather suited better Me than you: I am thy debtor For injured honour, having given Thee my word, without evasion Or postponement to renew it; Once again, I say I'll do it On the very first occasion:â DON GUTIERRE, within. Why, oh! why, unpitying Heaven, Do you leave me thus despairing, When one flash of thy red lightning Could reduce me into dust? [He rushes from the house. KING. What is this? DIEGO. Don Gutierre Rushes frantic from his house! KING. Whither goest thou, Gutierre? GUTIERRE. To embrace thy feet, my lord:â Hear the most extreme misfortune, Of all tragedies the rarest That man's wondering admiration Ever blended with his fear. My beloved wife, my Mencia, She as chaste as she was beauteous, She as fair as she was pureâ She whose praises time re-echoedâ She my Mencia, whom I worshipped With my life, my very soulâ Saw herself this night prostrated By a sharp and sudden illness, Which, to prove that she was human And not all divine, attacked her: A physician who can boast him Of the highest name and fame, And who in the world doth merit Never-ending deathless praises, Quick prescribed for her a bleeding, As he hoped to re-establish By this means, the healthy action Of the part thus sorely threatened By an illness so important:â So 'twas done; for I in person Being the only one remaining In the house, called in a surgeon, All my servants being absent:â When, my lord, I went to see her, Hastening to her room this morningâ (Here my tongue grows mute with sorrow! Here my trembling breath doth fail me!) I beheld the bed empurpled With her blood so sadly fatal, And her white robe crimsoned over,â And in it, O God! was lying Cold and dead, my darling Mencia, Having bled to death at night; Which doth prove how very easy Can itself a bandage open. But ah! me, why thus presuming Strive I to reduce to language Such a sorrowful misfortune? Turn your pitying gaze then yonderâ There you see the sun looks bloody, There you see the pale moon darkenedâ Robbed of light the starry legions, Dark with clouds the azure skiesâ There you see the peerless beauty Born for sorrow and misfortune, Who that I might die while living, Takes my soul with her to Heaven! [The door of the house is thrown open, and DoÃ±a Mencia is seen lying dead upon a couch. KING, aside. Wonderful occurrence! Now Prudence is of utmost moment, Greatly will forbearance cost me;â What a strange revenge is his!â Hide this horror so appallingâ [Aloud. Prodigy so sadly fearfulâ Piteous spectacle of wonderâ Hapless symbol of misfortune! [The door is closed. Gutierre, consolation You require, that your bereavement, Which is great, may be atoned for By a gain of equal valueâ Give your hand to Leonore:â For 'tis time you satisfy the Debt you owe to her so long, And that I fulfil my promise When a fit occasion offered, To restore her fame and honour. GUTIERRE. Ah! my lord, while yet the ashes Of so great a fire are glowing With the scarce fled vital heat, Let me weep my loss a little; Have I not a fatal warning? KING. It must be; it is enough. GUTIERRE. Would you wish, my lord, that scarcely Safe from the howling storm, again I the angry sea should trust to? What shall excuse so wild an act? KING. Obedience to your King's commands. GUTIERRE. Deign, then, to hear, my lord, in private Still stronger reasons:â KING. These excuses What may they be? GUTIERRE. Must I re-enter Upon a state so full of peril? What, if I find your royal brother Disguised at night within my house? KING. Do not give faith to mere suspicion. GUTIERRE. And if behind the very arras Of my bed, I find the dagger Of the Infante Don Enrique? KING. Remember there are thousand servants In the world by gold corrupted, And thy better sense invoke. GUTIERRE. How many times then must I do so, If night and day I see him haunting The very precincts of my house? KING. Complain to me: GUTIERRE. And if complaining A greater grief, by listening, hear? KING. What matter if it proves unreal, And that her beauty stands a fortress, Ever girt round by walls of virtue, 'Gainst which the winds may blow in vain? GUTIERRE. And if, unto my home returning, I find a certain letter, asking The Infante not to go? KING. There is a remedy for all things. GUTIERRE. What! is it possible? for this one? KING. Yes, Gutierre. GUTIERRE. What, my lord? KING. It is your own. GUTIERRE. What is it? KING. Bleeding! GUTIERRE. What do you say? KING. That you had better Make clean the portals of your dwellingâ A bloody hand is on your doors. GUTIERRE. Those who exercise a calling, Place a scutcheon o'er their doors, On whose shield their arms are blazoned. Honour is my calling, so I my hand in red blood bathed Placed upon my door, to show That the secret stains of honour Can be only washed in blood. KING. Give your hand to Leonore, Since I know her many virtues Merit it. GUTIERRE. I give it, then; But remember it is bathed Still with blood, fair Leonore. LEONORE. 'Tis no matter; that doth neither Wake my wonder nor my fear. GUTIERRE. Remember, too, I am Physician Of my own Honour, and my skill Is not forgotten. LEONORE. Cure with it My life, when deadly danger threatens. GUTIERRE. Then, on that express condition I present it unto you. ALL THE CHARACTERS. Thus is ended the Physician Of his own Honour; pray forgive All its many imperfections. END OF THE PHYSICIAN OF HIS OWN HONOUR.</field>
