      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Wood near Oxford. Enter Wilton, R. as in deep thought: suddenly he rouses himself, and gazes around. Wil. Full four miles from the city! Faith, in my fool's abstraction, I may wander Wider than prudence dictates. One good hour Have I spent fruitlessly in moody thought— No plan matur'd: the pleasing art of vengeance For those who would excel, is most abstruse; I'll make it my life's study—yes, I swear it! Here, as I gaze on yonder towering pile, Casing the magnets of my hate; a hate The more intense, being love's mutation. Enter Antony Rip, L. running, and out of breath. Seeing Wilton, he stops short. Wil. (Drawing.) Ah! A Puritan!—surrender! Rip. This is lucky. Good Master Wilton, dost not know me—eh? Not know poor honest Anthony? tis he— Anthony Rip. Wil. Why, scoundrel, hast turn'd traitor? 'Twas thought that thou wert dead: what brings thee hither? Rip. When made prisoner at Marston Moor, I thought Puritanism and life better than loyalty and death; so I swore fidelity to the Parllament, and forthwith had my hair instead of my head cropped: this arrangement has just brought me into a skirmish at Islip Bridge, where I find myself opposed to my old pot-comrades; and, curse me, if I like to cut throats which have been moistened from the same black-jack as my own. Wil. I see; thou would'st serve again the King, but that thou'rt bound— Rip. Bound? Oh, no! I havn't the slightest tie: I only gave my oath and honour to the Roundheads; but, then, his Majesty and Prince Rupert are over severe in military law but curse me, I'll risk the chance of being hanged for desertion, rather than remain with such a set of snivelling hypocrites, who havn't the moral courage to belch out a rattling oath, nor the sense to get insensibly drunk. Their diabolical system of prayers and abstinence has so clarified my system, that I'm absolutely dying of an unterrestrial purity; my body is becoming too sublimated for my mind, which yearneth for the salutary debauch of the olden time—sela! Wil. Now listen: thou hast ere this done work for me in which unscrupulousness and secrecy were requisite, and I have been no niggardly paymaster? What would'st thou now for me, if I make thy peace with the Royalists? Rip. What would I do—what would I not do? Make my peace, and I give ye my oath I'll forswear myself, cut throats, rob churches, abduct maids, corrupt wives—in fact, do ought that an honest, well-meaning fellow may—sela! Wil. Dost see that distant building? Rip. What, Blechington House? Ah, many a tankard have I emptied there when Sir Thomas Coggins was master: 'tis now held by Colonel Wyndebanke. Oh, I see—you'd wish his brains puffed out—by accident. I now remember he is a rival of yours for the hand of that delicate damsel, Edith Fenwicke. Wil. He married her yesterday. Rip. The devil he did! that's a pity, because what's done is beyond prevention; but if you still have a fancy for her— Wil. Rip, I have done with love. Rip. That's right—you're not made for it. Excuse me, Master Wilton, but you haven't exactly the figure, and decidedly not the countenance of a lady-killer. Love is mightily agreeable when not of the sentimental breed, but if you wish to erry her off— Wil. No! Rip. Then I don't see how my peculiar talents can serve you. Wil. I said my love had pass'd—but not the memory How I have lov'd. I said that Wyndebanke Had married her, but yet I did not say That I forgave the blasters of my hope So dearly cherished. Rip, I'll be revenged! To them and to their house, my life to come, Will I be as an evil genius—mark me! Already have I cramm'd Prince Rupert's ear With hints that make their loyalty suspected. By this, young Fenwicke—(Edith's brother)—lost A long besought appointment, and by this Thy agency, and schemes as yet unripe I'll work their ruin. Rip. Amen! I'm thine. As for that boy, George Fenwicke, I'd slash his hide with infinite pleasure; 'twas he who rescued Bess Dimple, just as she had fainted in my arms—he crossed me in the tender passion of love. Wil. Come with me, then; I take thee to my service. Rip. I have also information respecting red-nosed Noll's movements, well worth a few gold pieces. Wil. Follow! be honest in my cause, and thou shalt prosper. (Exit R. H. Rip. Oh, I will; honesty's the best policy—(Aside)—if you want to starve. No, this is a villainous world, and I flatter myself that I am a man of the world. O be joyful—sela! (Exit R. H. SCENE II. —A Grand Hall in Blechington House. Music is playing, and through folding doors in C. are seen Mrs. Wabble, Horner and Guests at a table. Enter George Fenwicke R. C. and comes forward, followed by Ticely. Tice. Why do you leave the board so suddenly? Fen. Because I cannot, with a zealous heart Pledge the king's health as they are doing now. Sir, this some time has been my reasoning— (Albeit to none but you as yet I've own'd it)— Why should I owe allegiance to a monarch Who values not my service? why not I Like to a proud, spurned suitor, turn my zeal To a more flattering object? Tice. True—why not? I'm glad to know you think so far with me Who throws a weapon from him should not marvel If his antagonist assails him with it. No, you have youthful ardour, which should raise you High in men's admiration—shall't be crush'd By non-appreciation? Take appointment In the re-modell'd army, under Cromwell. Fen. But how t' obtain it? Tice. I will tell thee that. Anon I'll join thee.—others are approaching. (Fenwicke retires, C. Enter Wabble, R. C. and comes down C. Wab. By Jupiter, the gallant Colonel is an incomparable host, as I said to his wife, if he gives such nuptial festivals as these, I hope he may marry every year. I never had such a two days feast: I've laughed till my sides ache, danced till my legs ache, and eaten till my— —(Putting his hand on his stomach.) Tice. Ah, this is the sugar that cases the matrimonial pill— it soon dissolves, and then—But you have been some time married, friend Wabble, and know the dread secrets of the hymeneal world. Wab. Oh, lord bless ye: my dear little wife and I live like a pair of turtle doves. I've no inconsiderable degree of affection for her, and she—(bless her!)—doats on me—literally doats upon me. No jealousy—no wrangling—my word is unquestionable law. “Do it,” say I, and it is done—now that's comfortable, isn't it? Tice. Oh, very. Is not that your lady, yonder? Wab. Yes, that's she, talking with young Captain Horner. Tice. Aye, she has been by his side all day Captain Horner is a promising youth? Wab. Well, I think he's a very fine young fellow—of remarkably prepossessing address. Tice. Remarkably so—especially to the ladies. Wab. Eh? Tice. He boasts that he never fails to create a strong impression. Wab. Eh? Tice. Either with single or married females. Wab. Eh? Tice. Did you ever hear the tale of his carrying off the miller's wife? Wab. Eh? Tice. Oh, it's true. Wab. Is it? (Calling Mrs. W.) Patty, come here! (Mistress Wabble leaves Horner, and comes forward, L.) My dear, we'll e'en go homeward now. Mrs. W. Oh, no—we'll stay until to-morrow. I am but just beginning thoroughly to enjoy the company. Wab. My dear, I say, we'll go. Mrs. W. Then e'en go by yourself Master Wabble; I shall not. But now I promised Captain Horner that I would not depart until the morrow. Wab. Oh, lord! (Aside to Ticely.) I say, are you sure it was true respecting the miller's wife? Tice. Quite true Wab. My love, I insist upon our departure. Mrs. W. Insist, sir? Insist! dare to repeat that word, and I'll never go home again. Wab. (Aside to Ticely.) That Horner's done the mischief already. Here he comes. (Captain Horner comes down from back, L. H.) Hor. Come, come: in company, a conference 'Twixt man and wife is not allowable. Wab. There—there's a doctrine! Is it not allowed? Then more's the pity, sir: 'twere better Than that the wife should flirt with libertines— The miller's wife to wit! Hor. The miller's wife Explain, sir. Mrs. W. Yes, explain. Wab. (To Ticely.) Here—you explain. Tice. What mean you? Hor. Sir, you're drunk. Mrs. W. Yes, you're drunk. Tice. You're drunk. Wab. It's a falsehood! Mrs. W. What, dare you, sir, to charge me with a falsehood? Tice. Or me, sir? Hor. Or dare you say, sir, I affirm a falsehood? Wab. What, three on one? I'll neither be bearded nor intimidated: whoever says I'm drunk, says a lie! Mrs. W. (Slaps his face.) That for your insolence! and for the rest, tarry till we're at home. Tice. You're rightly serv'd. Hor. (Pulls his nose.) And that, sir— Tice. Very good. Wab. Here—help, here! Murder! (Guests come forward.) Enter Colonel Wyndebanke and Fenwicke, R. C. Col. W. What, friends at words? How's this? Avoid, I pray, The evil omen of a bridal feud. Do ye lack entrrtainment, that dissension Obtrudes its brawling presence? I have news Shall furnish fresh discourse. At Islip Bridge The king's brigade of horse is now encount'ring A force led on by Cromwell. Wab. Islip Bridge! But five miles hence. Tice. If Cromwell is so near There's danger. We were best depart, and each Look to the safety of his proper home. Wab. I think so too. First Guest. And I. Second Guest. And I! Wab. Egad, There's no one in my house who, to protect it, Will cry out “For the Roundheads!” I must go. Tice. The Roundheads, Wabble? Wouldst thou shout for them? I thought thou wert a king'sman. Wab. Certainly— If king'smen are the victors. I do wish That one or other of these parties would Gain questionless ascendancy. You see, These see-saw battles keep a man, as 'twere, Uncertain of his conscience's inclining. Col. W. I would that others lack'd, as thou dost, wit To hide pusillanimity. Well, friends, Go hence, if't be your wish; for know, I've pledged My soldier's honour to King Charles to hold, To the very last extremity, this house, Should it e'er be besieg'd. I swore it, friends, When late his Majesty did honour us With his most gracious presence, and to the letter Depend on't will I keep my troth, e'en though Successful Cromwell plant himself before it. Wab. Thank you; we'll go. I think that I may speak The hearts of all your guests, and say, your fare Has been most princely. Ha—here comes the bride! Enter Edith, R. C. Madam, may all the comforts of your state— (I mean, of course, the matrimonial state)— Attend you through the remnant of your life: Obey and love your husband, and— Mrs. W. Come hence: Don't talk such nonsense. Wab. Well, my love, I've done: So, fare ye well, my friends. (The Guests take leave: as they are going up the Stage, a Messenger enters hastily, L. C.) Mes. Sir—sir, the royal forces have been beaten, And victor Cromwell comes in hot pursuit! Without are numbers of the fugitives, Who crave admittance and protection. Col. W. Give it! Admit as many as you safely may, But yield no egress; now it is too late. When they have enter'd, barricade the portal. (Exit Messenger, L. C. Friends, now ye must perforce remain with me. Fen. And why perforce? Is this like courtesy, To make us accessary to your measures, And share their dangers? I can tell you, sir, You cannot hold this house a three days' siege; A time sufficient only to exasperate. Col. W. (Resolutely.) I'll hold it, George, until they beard me here— Here, in my chamber! Wab. If it comes to that, They'll stick us all without an explanation! Fen. (Approaching Colonel.) Soh! Colonel Wyndebanke, your lust of fame Drowns all consideration of your friends, Kindred, or wife: all these you'd sacrifice For?(bigot's synonyme)—that loyalty, For one who— Col. W. Hold, sir! should you dare to speak One word aspersive of my king, perchance I may forget you own the honoured title— My loved wife's brother. Fen. You've forgotten that Already. Edith. Husband—brother—be not angered At such a moment. Fen. Anger'd? I'm resolved! On his own head alight the consequence. Hence I depart, and who shall stay me? Col. W. Go! Not I. I would not in my walls detain A waverer in loyalty or valour. Fen. (Returning.) In valour, Wyndebanke—was that your word? By heaven, I now could find it in my heart— Edith. Nay, brother—for my sake, forbear! Fen. I will. (To Colonel.) Another time you'll answer this foul hint. Come, sister; if he has a manly heart, He will not here detain you. Col. W. How? my wife! Wouldst take her hence—my bride of yesterday? Well, Edith, an' you wish it, go with him. Edith. What, leave thee? no! Dear brother, fare you well! Come weal or woe, where he is, there am I: Safety without my husband's worse than peril; With him I dread no danger. Fen. Foolish girl! Remember, sir, that indirectly, you Have termed me coward! That dissolves all tie Of new-formed kin. I say, remember it, For these are times when vengeance may be had With little seeking. Should it visit you, Deem it not causeless—you have called me coward! (Exit U. E. L. H. Wab. Come, friends, we'll follow him. Col. W. No; I forbid ye. I cannot change my order, though I've made Here an exception. I have cogent reasons For urging ye to tarry. Wab. (Imitating Fenwicke.) Well, that's pleasant! Now, who shall stop me, sir? (Swaggering.) Col. W. (To Ticely.) With you I leave The charge of these, my friends. Come, Edith, with me. Nay, girl, look not so pale. The King, at Oxford, Will soon have notice of our present plight. To those who love our monarch, this detainment Cannot offend; and those who love him not Are enemies of mine, and I am heedless Of their ill-favour. (Exit with Edith, U. E. R. H. Wab. Well, this is devilish pleasant! We are to stay here, and quietly have our throats cut. No, I will be curst if I do! I'll go boldly, and have a personal explanation with General Cromwell. Don't be alarmed, friends; I'll save your lives, or perish in the attempt! (Rushes out, U. E. L. H. Tice. Ho, there! Enter Servant, R. H. Bring back yon fugitive; Against the Colonel's orders he would leave. (Exit Servant, U. E. L. H. Come, Horner, enter thou this chamber—there Administer some comfort to this lady. (Horner, Mrs. Wabble, &amp; Guests enter Chamber, 2 E. R. H. Now to find means to ope the gates to Cromwell; 'Twould pave my way to fortune. (Servants enter U. E. L. bringing back Wabble.) Wab. How dare you, sir, detain me? Tice. You must stay! Serv. Ay, that must he; for Cromwell, with his whole force, is now before the gates, and threatens death to the whole garrison, if the house be not immediately surrendered. Wab. Oh, lord! oh, lord! My throat—Mistress Wabble's throat! Where is she? Tice. Trouble not yourself concerning your wife. Captain Horner has taken charge of her. Wab. Eh—what—when—where? Restore her to me! I won't die dishonoured! Where is Mistress Wabble? Tice. Nay, then, we will lock you up alone: you're turbulent! Come, sir—(Ticely and Servants force Wabble into another chamber, L. H. as he exclaims loudly “Mrs. Wabble! Mrs. Wabble!” SCENE III. —An Anti-Chamber in Blechington House. Enter Colonel Wyndebanke and Edith, R. H. Wyn. Thus, then, is all secure 'gainst stratagem, And time alone, with perseverance, vanquish. (To Edith.) Why dost thou wear that terror-stricken brow? And, Edith, how thou tremblest. Shame upon thee! But yet, poor girl, no marvel. 'Tis indeed A rude induction to our honeymoon: Still fear not, dearest, at the worst thou'rt safe, For e'en this Cromwell, after his own fashion, Tempers asperity with gallantry. (Edith buries her head in his bosom. Edith—dear Edith, where has fled thy courage? But now you boldly said you'd stay with me, And brave all dangers. Edith. So I would with you— Aught—aught with you. My dread is of a parting! If they subdue us, they will tear you from me, Or murder you! Oh, what will be your fate, If in the hands of these stern men we fall! Wyn. A forethought most unworthy of a soldier, Or e'en a soldier's wife. To entertain it were to doubt success, To doubt, to lose our purpose—but we will not. My Edith, were I reckless of my name, The thought that on this brow a blush might mantle, At future question of thy husband's valour, Alone would make me valiant—urge me on To give a precedent of proper firmness To royal partizans. How now—what tidings? Enter a Soldier, L. H. with a letter. Soldier. This missive, sir, from General Cromwell. (Exit Soldier, L. H. (As Colonel Wyndebanke reads, his countenance, which is eagerly watched by Edith, undergoes a marked change.) Wyn. (To himself.) Ha! Is't so indeed? Unfortunate! His stubborness Has brought this on him: I had rather given The all that I possess, except my honour, Than this should have befallen. Luckless! Edith. Edward! Wyn. (Not heeding her.) I should have stayed him: had it been by force. Self-will'd young man! What now wert best to do? Edith. Edward, you are disturb'd. What says the paper? Wyn. (Still aside.) And she, poor Edith, to her other care Will now have heap'd a thousand apprehensions For his—her brother's life. She must not know. Edith. For Heaven's sake, Edward, tell me what disturbs you? I am not trembling now, and so beseech you Hold me not in this agony of doubt. Come, let me see it— Wyn. (Aside.) Yet she soon must learn it. (To her.) Edith—(Aside.) I know not how to tell it! Edith, Your brother has fallen in the hands of Cromwell. Edith. (Alarmed.) My brother captive! But his life—his life! At least that's safe—is't not? Wyn. At present, yes. Edith. Oh, Heaven be thanked for that. What saith the letter? Wyn. (Evading her importunity.) Nothing of import. (Aside.) 'Sdeath, 'tis most distressing! (Drops the paper.) So brief a time, too, for deliberation. This Cromwell is a man, report affirms, To lit'ralize a threat. Well, well, the youth Has drawn this peril on himself—but Edith— Edith. (Having picked up the paper, reads with great emotion.) “Unless Blechington House be delivered up within an hour, the said George Fenwicke will be hanged on a gibbet in full sight of the garrison.” Oh, horrible! “But by your peaceable relinquishment your kinsman will be set at liberty, and yourselves allowed to depart unmolested.” His life so threaten'd—what may be his terror At this dread moment! What anxiety, Perchance, while now awaiting your reply. Oh, do not hold him, Edward, in suspense. Wyn. I must, by loud remonstrance and pretence Of treating for more advantageous terms, Gain time to adopt some measure. Edith. Yet, what measure? But one will save my brother. Wyn. Stay, my Edith— I know not that. Perchance while parleying, And thus alluring them to slacken guard, We may effect a sortie for a rescue: I'll mount, and note if their position, now, Favours this bold attempt. Rest, Edith, here. Edith. No, Edward, no: with you I will remain— Come, let us hasten; think of my poor brother— Wyn. (Impressively.) But not forgetting honour, Edith—come! Exeunt L. H. SCENE IV. —The Turrets of Blechington House. Sunset. Ticely and Horner are discovered in conversation, while Soldiers, &amp;c. are busy fixing pieces of ordnance, &amp;c. Others on guard. Hor. Egad, we'll tease these rascals. Here we'll grin, And let them shew their teeth. Tice. The garrison Is not so firm; th' example of young Fenwicke Has shaken confidence. For my own part, I'd say 'tis madness to hold out. Hor. You would! The devil claim young Fenwicke, then, say I, A proud, ambitious boy. He's rightly served, Thus falling in the hands of Oliver; Though, sooth to say, I think him now with those He would not scruple to accept as comrades. 'Tis said King Charles refused him an appointment— Know you upon what ground? Tice. 'Twas thought his father Had entertained a disaffected spirit— But, see, the Colonel comes. I will descend And look to the ammunition. (Exit L. H. Hor. I like not That fellow's bearing. Faith, I'll watch him closely. Enter Wyndebanke, R. H. Wyn. So, friends, the news is bad; our kinsman ta'en, And thence held out a threat. How stand their men? Can we—(Aside, and looking out, L. U. E.) By heaven, I doubt it! They are drawn In palpable anticipation on't. No, no: attack is hopeless. Enter Edith, R. H. Edith. See, Edward, they're in motion, and engaged Upon some work close underneath the wall. Look, Edward: what is that huge thing they're raising? (Goes back. Hor. (To Wyn.) It looks most marvellously like a gibbet. Wyn. (Aside to Horner.) Hush, I beseech you! (Wyndebanke motions him to keep silence, and gives directions. Exit Horner, L. H. Edith. (Who has caught Horner's words.) Oh, my poor brother! Edward—dearest Edward— For mercy's sake, delay not e'en a moment— The time is passing. Since you must surrender, Oh, do it quickly, I beseech you! Wyn. (Drawing her to him.) Edith, I beg—nay, I command you, do not utter Within the hearing of my soldiery One word of yielding. I again remind you Of the strict pledge I gave my king. Edith. (Almost choking with emotion, and entirely disregarding his caution.) Oh, horror! My brother—Edward, is he, then, to die? Wyn. I hope not, dearest. Cromwell will not dare— 'Tis but a threat to terrify. Retire, I beg you, Edith. Depend on't I'll do all That can be done consistent with my pledge. Edith. Edward—my brother—is he, then, to die? Wyn. I hope not. Edith. How! you hope not—say he shall not! What is a hasty promise to a life? Think you your king would wish you to become A monster of such inhumanity, Because in ignorance of casualty A pledge was offered. (She bursts into tears, and falls at his feet.) Edward—dearest Edward, The time—the hour is passing rapidly— Will you permit your bride to sue in vain? Oh, if my love is valued, and you'd not That of my dear affection, I should tear Each vestige from my heart—this instant save— Save my poor brother, nor for a moment think Of being what I should ever after hold you— His murderer! Wyn. (Greatly moved.) Hush, girl. You do not know The wily arts of Cromwell. We've no proof As yet, that George is truly in his hands. Edith. (Having again, approached parapet.) Look—look, then, there! Ah, look—they lead him forth— His hands are bound—his neck is bare—yes, look, They lead him towards the gibbet—(Rushing to him.)—Edward—husband— For God's sake, save him! (The Soldiers, standing by, murmur. Wyndebanke, as though almost bewildered, passes his hand across his brow, but, recovering himself, says in a deep but trembling tone: Wyn. Dearly as I love you, You shall not make me waver in my honour That, as his life, belongs unto the king, And were I, Edith, in that youth's position, And he in mine, I'd hold the self-same tenet, And gladly die to do my monarch service. Edith. But such a death—so terrible—oh, horror! Enter Horner, hastily, L. Hor. The treacherous Ticely, Wyndebanke— Wyn. Well, speak— Hor. Is even now inciting those below To throw the portal open to the enemy. Edith. Thank heaven! Wyn. (Angrily.) Silence! Horner, will you aid me? I know you will. Take, then, some trusty men, And plant them in the court yard: let them fire On him who dares attempt to cross it first Without my special order. Hor. I will do it. (Exit L. Edith. He mounts the scaffold—see! (Altering her tone from entreaty to firm determination.) Inhuman husband! I'll not long survive him! (She suddenly plants herself on the extreme verge of the parapet, L. C.) Now save my brother—save him instantly, Or, by the heaven above, I spring from hence, And make you thus the cruel murderer Of him and me! (The Soldiers murmur loudly.) Wyn. Bring forth the signal! (A white flag is brought forward, which Wynde, seizes, and waves from the parapet, L. C. Distant shouts are heard—Edith descends and embraces the knees of Wyndebanke, who, as he raises her, exclaims: There, woman! Teach me now to face my king! END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —A Hall at Oxford. Prince Rupert C. Wilton R. and Officers discovered. Prince R. What say you, Wilton? Blechington surrendered Without a single blow! How learned you this? Wil. Th' ejected garrison are entering Oxford With them, their leader, Colonel Wyndebanke. Prince R. Know you his motive for this rash surrender? Wil. So please ye, there are many rumours current. Some say 'twas cowardice—while others hint A private understanding with the Roundheads, Paving hereby a path, by which, with grace He may hereafter step into their int'rests. Prince R. By heaven, I'll make example of him; be it Treach'ry or cowardice his life shall answer! Wil. He has arrived and waits to see the king. Prince R. Conduct him hither! (Officers go out, L. H.) 'Sdeath, it galls me sore Such poltroons live to spread contagious poison. Re-enter Officers and Colonel Wyndebanke, L. H. Now, Colonel Wyndebanke, few men e'er sin Lacking some paltry pretext—what is yours? Wyn. (Looking around.) Where is my king? Prince R. Your king! whence claim that title? Have you approved yourself his subject? Wyn. Who doubts my loyalty? Wil. I'll produce a man Who'll swear to have heard you, more than once, to speak Derogatory both of regal function And majesty. Wyn. (Turning to him) Oh! you'll produce a man To swear this falsehood—you'll produce him? doubtless! My lord Prince Rupert, do you know this Wilton? Know him, I mean, as men should all be known By their past deeds, the guarantee for what They're capable of doing: if so enough: I need but say—he lies! Yet, whence his motive? I own an envied treasure in a wife Surpassing praise in wealth of excellence; Whom fortune in her bounty having given, Has drawn on me this boundless emmity. Prince R. Such language in our presence, Wyndebanke! Know yourself, sir, and be more temperate. Wyn. Great powers! temperate, when slur is cast Upon my loyalty; when villains dare— Prince R. Sir, you should know, you stand in no position To carp at every doubt of your allegiance; I more than doubt it, for I cannot think That the possessor of one grain of manhood Would, at a time like this, hold out example So base as yours, from mere rank cowardice; For that must be the term alone t' award, If from disloyalty's foul stain we cleanse you. Wyn. (Hastily.) My lord, Prince Rupert— Prince R. Curb your passion, sir, It will not serve you here. Wyn. I crave your highness's pardon: I, perchance Might of another, judge from circumstance Harshly as you. My lord, I pray you, listen: The anxiety to justify myself In estimation of all honest hearts Urges the explanation, which is due, (At least I think it,) to my king alone— To him I promised, that Blechington Should to the last extremity be held Against invading power; and when that power, Led on by Cromwell came—the same resolve Shrunk not one jot, as can be testified By many who were with me. Sir, what follows Appeals more strongly to humanity, Than to a military sense of duty; And therefore would I that my king were present. A youth—George Fenwicke—my wife's only brother, Most haplessly had fallen in the hands Of the besiegers. Ruthless Cromwell swore That lest within an hour the house were yielded, Upon a gibbet—(which was forthwith rais'd Within our sight)—the captive youth should die. Need I to add, the peril of her brother To my poor wife, induced a mental terror Verging on madness. She implored me save him! Relying on my king's indulgent mercy, I did so. There is my pretext which I have rehears'd, Because I'll hear no more of traitorship. Prince R. And wherefore is this said George Fenwicke absent? Has he his liberty? Wyn. I know not. Prince R. (Sneeringly.) No? Wil. My prince, I pray you, if I speak again Deem not that malice prompts, Might not all this Be an enactment, understood full well 'Twixt Cromwell and our gallant Colonel, here, To blind the garrison? for 'tis reported That this same Fenwicke heads the skirmishers From whom this very hour we took a prisoner. Wyn. Venomous reptile! but for ev'ry lie, I give you back an honest soldier's scorn. I stand here arm'd with innocence and honour— Let men of honour judge me. Prince R. Yes, this night. By which time Colonel Wyndebanke, a Court Will here assemble for your trial. Now Know that you are arrested. (Soldiers come forward. Wyn. How! a trial This night? Prince R. The exigency of affairs Admits of no delay. Prepare yourself— Your case is critical, for this I tell you If from the evidence your guilt be prov'd, Cast from you the fallacious hope of mercy. (Exit R. H. Wyn. (Turning to Wilton.) There has been some malignant tongue at work, Some envious, busy knave! This is no treatment For an approved officer Wil. (Disregarding his speech.) Conduct him To the old guard-room, and secure it well, And till the trial let no soul approach. Wyn. Villain! on what authority— Wil. No more! Away with him! I'll hold no altercation With traitrous cowards. Wyn. (Rushing to him.) Slave! unsay those words! Retract I say! (Strikes Wilton—the Soldiers seize and disarm him. Wil. A blow! you'll rue this hour. Wyn. 'Tis but a prelude to the chastisement Which, on a future day, I'll help thee to. Wil. (Significantly.) That day will never come: the traitor's fate— The gibbet, waits thee. Wyndebanke thou'rt doom'd! Wyn. I doubt it not, if on your evil efforts Success should wait; but I defy your craft, Confiding in the genius of truth. Bring all your perjur'd evidence, I'll face it! At your malicious prophecy I laugh, And thus retaliate. Your doom is this— A heart to deal in ev'ry paltry vice With sense to feel the humbling influence— The lasting torment of a proud ambition, With but degrading roguery to back it: Rather than such a mortifying life, Give me the gibbet which you promis'd. Wil. Yes. Boaster, 'tis nigh at hand—go brood upon't. (Exeunt Wilton R. H. Wyndebanke and Soldiers L. H. SCENE II. —A Guard Room. Benches, Tables, &amp;c. Ticely, bound as a prisoner, sitting beside Rip, who, slightly intoxicated, is drinking and smoking. Rip. Come, talk—talk, and look not so gloomy. When a man hasn't long to live, it behoveth him to be jolly. Look here; here is but one sup left in this tankard, and but listen how I smack my lips over it. Ah, ah—the ups and downs of life, Master Ticely. I knew you governor of Oxford jail. I was once your prisoner, and—ha, ha—down bumps your end of the see-saw, and here you are, mine: and serve you rightly. What made you volunteer into the scurvy Parliament army? Tice. I was entrapped by that young Fenwicke, who has prevailed upon Cromwell to give him a lieutenancy, and, as I told you, already heads a skirmishing party, from which yoa captured me. Rip. The artful young scamp! And so he was in league with Noll to frighten the Blechington garrison into a surrender by pretending to go bare-necked to the scaffold. Ha, ha! a cunning trick, and well acted. But, harkee, Ticely—if you can make it appear that Colonel Wyndebanke was privy to and seconded this stratagem, you will find favour with Wilton, and, peradventure, save yourself. Do you understand? Tice. I'll do it, trust me, effectually. Rip. Will you? That's right. Come, drink of this fresh stoup; I love a pot companion. Tice. Then, pray you, good comrade toper, take off these manacles. Rip. No, no, good Master Ticely, I dare not trust myself; for though I give praise I am of sober habit, yet flesh is weak, and a little overcomes me, and knowing you to be a thorough backbone rascal—excuse me—I might chance to lose you, or have my own throat divided; nevertheless, O be joyful, and take a pipe. I will e'en light it for thee. (Sticks a pipe in Ticely's mouth.) Tice. No, take it hence. I will not smoke unless you release me. Rip. (Cuffing him.) Then take that, for an unsociable cur! I swear the very first man that comes here shall smoke for thee, or I will cut his windpipe. Enter Wabble, L. H. Wab. Ah, gentlemen—I beg pardon for alarming you by my abrupt entrance. Rip. Alarmed! Fire and brimstone, what mean you by alarmed? What d'ye want? Wab. I beg your pardon, but—but have you seen Mistress Wabble? Rip. And who is Mistress Wabble? Wab. I beg your pardon, but that's my wife. My name's Wabble. Rip. Why, man, what should we do with thy wife—art drunk? Wab. In a few words I'll explain. We were on a wedding visit at Blechington, which, being delivered to the Round-heads, we have come to Oxford for safety; and while I was walking a short time since with Mistress Wabble—that's my wife—we overheard a soldier to say that Colonel Wyndebanke was to be tried this very night as a traitor; so nothing would serve my wife—(she's a good-hearted creature!)—but we must offer ourselves as witnesses, to tell all about it, and justify the Colonel. I said, “Be quiet; 'tis no business of ours; we shall only get ourselves in a mess.” But she is a wilful body—(my wife)—and off she started without me; so, after a little consideration, I started after her, and here I am. Have you seen Mistress Wabble? Rip. Is she well-favoured? Tice. The plumpest, most inviting little darling you ever dropt eyes on. Wab. Why that is Master Ticely, as I live! Glad to see you. Have you seen Mistress Wabble—how shall I find her? Tice. I would counsel you first to enquire for Captain Horner. Wab. Oh, don't mention it. What a devil of a fellow that is! As I'm a valiant man, here he comes, and—horror and despair—she—she—my wife—Mistress Wabble is with him! (Sinks into a chair R. H. Enter Captain Horner and Mistress Wabble, L. H. Mrs. W. Oh, my husband is here. Thank you, Captain Horner, for your kind protection amongst all those uncouth soldiers. Wab. How can you utter those two sacred words, “my husband,” without sinking into the floor with your weight of shame! What do you with that man? Hor. How now, friend Wabble— Wab. Friend be—Don't friend me, sir. (Crosses.) That is Mistress Wabble, sir—my wife, sir. I didn't go to the expense of marrying her for your gratification, friend as I am. Take my ox, my ass, my anything else that is mine, but don't attempt to take her, or look to it, both of ye! Mrs. W. Oh, you idiot— Hor. I met your wife, endeavouring to make her way to the guard-room, and assisted her: is there crime in that? Rip. (Coming forward.) Here, I'll be peace-maker. Master Wabble, be satisfied, and hold your tongue, or this fistlet shall flatten that noselet of yours—sela! Captain Horner, 'tis the duty of every soldier to do his best when a woman's in the case, and I doubt not you have done your duty. Mistress Wabble, to prove that I think well of you, accept this token— [Attempts to kiss her.] Wab. Yes, yes; she requires no token—thank you all the same. Rip. There, now we are all friends—oh, be joyful! Wab. Well, Captain Horner, now let us thoroughly understand one another: I am not a man to be trifled with—with respect to my share of my own wife— Hor. There, take her to your arms, and fear no wrong from me. Rip, I have received orders from Wilton to start immediately with dispatches to Chester. This paper, which I have just written, contains all the information I am able to give respecting the surrender of Blechington, and, in my absence, may be of service to Colonel Wyndebanke. I trust it with you. [Gives paper to Rip.] Rip. It shall be put to its proper purpose. Hor. Ticely, I am sorry to see you in this plight, but 'tis a just return for your treachery. Tice. Reproach me not. I have heartily repented, and shall endeavour to make reparation by bearing witness—(though to my own disadvantage)—to the late manly and upright conduct conduct of Colonel Wyndebanke. Mrs. W. Do so, that's a sweet gentleman: we have come hither for the same purpose. Hor. You will do well. Rip, may I advise that you remove his bands, and treat him indulgently. (Rip removes the manacles.) I would have desired to have seen Wyndebanke before I started, but learn that access is strictly prohibited. Commend me to him. Adieu! [Exit L. H. Rip. Now, Wabble, sit down and drink. I desire to cultivate your acquaintance, and this pretty wife of yours shall sit beside me. [They sit. Wabble, R. and Rip and Mrs. W. L. of table Rip kisses Mrs. W.] Wab. [Rising.] Stop: allow me to say that is not agreeable to the feelings of a husband. Mistress Wabble, come here. Rip. Pshaw, man, this is nothing: if the sight pleases you not, turn your back on us, and we'll put up with the rudeness. Wab. Mistress Wabble, we will not remain here. Rip. Harkee, Wabble; perchance you do not know me. I am Anthony Rip, celebrated for cutting throats and blowing brains out. Look—here is my pistol, crammed to the muzzle: a word or two from you will pull the trigger, and silence your tongue for ever. [Loudly.] Obey me, sirrah, d'ye hear? Empty that flagon! [Wabble timidly takes the flagon, and drinks, but stops for want of breath] Drink it up, or by the ceiling above, and the floor beneath, I'll— Wab. [Out of breath.] I—I cannot take any more, I— Rip. [In a voice of thunder.] Empty the can, d'ye hear? [Wabble drinks again.] Now take a pipe, and light it. Wab. [Aside.] Oh, lord—oh, lord! Excuse me, I can't smoke. Wab. [Taking up pistol.] Smoke! Wab. How d'ye do it? Rip. Here's a light. [Lights the paper which Horner gave him.] Wab. Do you know what you've done? That paper is— Rip. Hold your tongue, and smoke. Wab. [Aside.] Oh, lord—here's a situation! [He lights pipe.] Rip. Now if you dare to let that pipe out, I'll blow out your brains. Mrs. W. Oh, he'll be so ill directly, poor fellow. Rip. My love, never mind him. Now, sir, turn your back to us—[Wabble unwillingly turns.]—and whenever you hear me kiss Mrs. Wabble, take up the flagon by your side and drink, or listen to the crack of this pistol. Wab. [Aside.] Oh, dear—that wife will be the death of me. Enter Wilton, R. H. Wil. Rip, come hither. (Rip rises aad comes forward, L.) Has Captain Horner departed? Rip. Yes. Wil. That is well: and what of Ticely? Rip. He'll do anything you wish. Wil. 'Tis well again: and who are these? Rip. Two simple bodies, who desire to be witnesses in favour of the Colonel: but leave them to mo—I'll prevent their appearance. Wil. Enough. Master Ticely, follow me: I would speak with you. (Exit, followed by Ticely, R. H. Rip, Why, curse me, that fellow has turned round. Turn back again, knave, or— Wab. An it please you, this tobacco does not agree with me. Rip. Qualify it with strong ale, and I warrant 'twill agree. (Kisses Mistress Wabble, and lays his hand on his pistol. Wabble drinks.) There—now they have left us alone, let us be joyful. Come, I'll sing ye a song; and, mark ye, the burthen of each verse is a kiss. (During symphony Rip kisses Mistress Wabble, and Wabble, who is becoming intoxicated, drinks.) SONG.—RIP. If 'twere not for women and wine, what were life, A compound of trouble, of toil, and of strife— But the bottle in hand, and the wench on my knee, The devil may take all dull care, boys, for me. For I laugh, and I quaff, and I toy and I kiss, And where's the specific for sorrow like this? With my lass, and my glass, All care, boys, shall pass, For where's the specific for sorrow like this? What charming confusion those two things impart— The wine in the head, and the wench in the heart. If the woman be fair, and the bottle be free, The devil may take all dull care, boys, for me— For I laugh, and I quaff, and I toy, and I kiss, And where's the specific for sorrow like this? With my lass, and my glass, &amp;c. (As Rip is about to kiss Mistress Wabble again, she, expressing a dislike to his familiarity, slaps his face—a struggle ensues—Wabble rises to assist, but overcome with liquor, falls beneath the table. The Scene closes in.) SCENE III. —The Interior of a Cottage. Enter Fenwicke, L. H. followed by a Puritan Soldier, to whom he gives his arms and accoutrements. Fen. This hut must be our resting-place to-night. (Shouts without. Go, learn what means that tumult. (Exit Soldier, L. H. Oh, fortune, fortune, how art thou attain'd! I sicken even at my setting out. The road to fame should not be rashly chosen, For in progression we should find delight To nerve us for Ambition's ceaseless toil. No sickening qualms of conscience—no vile doubts Of the true honour of our cause, or—Pshaw! Whence tend these thoughts? I half despise myself For mingling in my nature such a compound Of rashness and irresolution. Well, What if I have from unweighed impulse started— Who madly choose should madly persevere, Or they but court due scorn for the first folly. Re-enter Soldier, L. H. conducting Captain Horner. Sold. So please ye, here is one has been arrested On the high road: he is a Royalist, And Serjeant Hughes pronounces him a spy. Hor. George Fenwicke! Are you the leader of these men? (Fenwicke motions to Soldier, who takes arms from Horner, and exit R. H. Fen. I am. Hor. The tale which I did hold as scandal, Is, then, too true. Oh, shame! Fen. And wherefore, Horner? Are you infallible, that you dare use That word to all dissentients. Hor. To you— To you I use it, not unto your cause, But for your method of adopting it; I use it, too, for Colonel Wyndebanke, Whom I now view in so debas'd a light, That richly he deserved the traitor's fate Now threat'ning him. Fen. What fate—what threatens him? Nay, hear me, Horner—he is no colleague. I swear most solemnly that Wydebanke Knew nought of my proceeding nor design— And, sooth to say, I bitterly repent The trick I put on him. Hor. What trick? Fen. 'Twas I Suggested the expedient to Cromwell Of feigning to have ta'en me captive. I, Knowing to common threat he would not yield, Led him to think my life in peril: that, That was unworthy of a man, ambitious T' acquire a soldier's fame. Hor. Indeed! and this Is but an afterthought? Is't possible The doing on't—the anticipation even, Breath'd no conviction of th' enormity? Could you, but for a moment, entertain A thought of building on your kinsman's life The unsecure foundation of your fortune? Fen. Nay, Horner, neither on his name nor life. Hor. I say, his life—your sister's life, dependent On that of him she loves. In prison now He waits this coming eve to take his trial: So rancorous is the general feeling 'gainst him, That, but his life, will sate that indignation Which you, shame on ye, have created. Fen. Heav'n! say ye so— Hor. But that is nought to you. You've made his head your stepping stone to fortune— If the contempt of honest men is fortune; Your sister's misery has brought you fortune, If to become a heartless monster's fortune; Honour and name you've bartered well for fortune, If sacrifice of self-esteem be fortune; But why talk I—I'm but your humble captive— There may be danger in't. Fen. Oh, speak not thus. I am no personal foe to you, although Your party's adversary. Hor. Well, how then? At heart my monarch's interest is mine, Therefore you are my personal enemy! I ask no favour at your hands, because I loathe you and your paltry power. Fen. Horner, Beware—I'll not be goaded thus. Hor. You—pshaw! A vile dissembler—trickster—(Crosses R. H.) Fen. (Angrily.) Silence, sir, Or, impulse-madden'd, I may something do My cooler thought shall wish recalled. Oh, Horner, (Changing his tone. You speak as though it were my nature's due To meet abhorrence—is it? You have known me From childhood; more than once I've sought your counsel In matters of perplexity, and found it Wrapp'd in frank love: accord once more such friendship, And tell me how to cancel this past folly. Hor. Die like Iscariot, your archetype, And thereby in an ocean of contempt Mix one small drop of pity for your weakness. Fen. Why, then, I'll have nor wav'ring nor remorse— Let the worst come—I'm callous! If there is no regaining honour lost, I'll woo more ardently it's opposite: Give me men's hate rather than their contempt, Henceforth I'm conscienceless, and, braggart, you Who play the heroic with such arrogance, Shall make no boast of having 'scap'd the flame You've so unwisely fann'd; for now, forthwith I'll have you led to Cromwell. (Crosses to R. H.) Ho, there, guard! Render account to him; and for your life Look not to me. Were you my brother—father— And I could save you by— Enter Soldier, R. H. Remove this man. Bid Hughes call out a guard of twenty men T' escort him to the General: first search, And hither bring whate'er you find on him. (Horner and Soldier, R. H. Fenwicke hesitates.) Stay—leave him with me but a moment longer. (Exit Soldier, R. H. (after a pause.) I cannot do it—no, by heaven I cannot! I am not what I think myself. Come, sir, I care not for yout taunting words, not I, So little have they stung, so harden'd am I, That I will set you on your way again In perfect safety. Aye, go spread abroad My perfidy—my vacillation—shame, Or what you will. Come, follow me: I'll see That unmolested you depart. (Going, then turning.) You said The life of Wyndebanke was threaten'd, did you? And that I'd sealed my sister's misery— But that affects me not. I am unmoved, Although 'twas I—Oh, God! Come, follow me! (Exeunt L. H. SCENE IV. —The Old Guard Room. Colonel Wyndebanke is led in by Serjeant Maye and Soldiers, U. R. Serj. This chamber, sir, you'll occupy until— Wyn. To-morrow, only. What is now the hour? Serj. Eight has just struck. Wyn. By that, then, but twelve hours Are all I have to live. Serj. Your lady, sir— (Who yesterday in vain sued for the favour)— Now waits admittance; by Prince Rupert's order: The trial over, now 'twill be permitted. (Exit with Soldiers, L. H. Wyn. Poor Edith, thou hast placed me here. To die To-morrow. Oh, how gladly would I yield To that same death, were ignominious stain, As undeserved as base, cleans'd from my name. 'Tis hard to die suspected; but to die With all th' apparent evidence of guilt, And scarce a hope that rectifying time May tell the world it err'd—'tis terrible! George Fenwicke, what a villain thou hast prov'd— No matter— Enter Edith, L. H. who runs to Wyndebanke. Edith. Edward! Wyn. (Gently displacing her.) No, this must not be, Till you resolve me of a cruel doubt Which shames me in the utterance. Oh, Edith, Have you been party to that treachery By which my life, but what is more, my honour Is sacrific'd? Edith. (Sobbing.) Oh, Edward! Wyn. Still I ask Were you an agent in your brother's scheme? Edith. (Eagerly.) Did he betray you, then? Wyn. Oh, answer me! Were you a plotter with him 'gainst your husband? Edith. No! no! ah, could you think it? (Falls in his arms.) Wyn. 'Tis enough! Then my poor wife, of nothing but affection Will I accuse you: 'gainst untoward fate We are unarm'd by prescience. Look up! I was a brute unworthy of thy love, To offer such an insult as suspicion. Forgive me, Edith—speak! alas, the time For our communion is but brief—then speak! Edith. (Glancing round.) Edward, to this I've brought you—'tis my deed. Oh, do not speak so kindly—I did this! Wyn. Nay, nay! but were it even so—'tis now Your office to make ample reparation. Edith. O tell me how—for mercy's sake, oh, tell me, How can I make atonement? Wyn. Edith, thus: Enable me to die with fortitude, Such as becomes a soldier. Edith. (Aghast.) Die! to die? Wyn. To-morrow; so my judges have decreed: And may the firmness of my parting moment Wipe from my character the foul aspersion Cast on it by my harsh accusers. Edith, No one but you can shake my firmness! Edith. Merciful heaven, die! You must be saved. You shall not die—no, no—why say it? They do not know the crime was mine. Oh, Edward! (Embraces him. Enter Wilton, armed, L. H. followed by Serj. Maye. Wil. (To Maye.) Who was it granted this? The interview Was meant to be permitted but an hour Before the execution—who has pass'd her? Maye. Sir, 'twas the Prince's word— Wil. 'Tis false, I say! Retire, and wait my call without. (Exit Serj. L. H. Well, Colonel Wyndebanke, your late espousal Of this most dainty type of fair perfection, Has stimulated you to noble deeds. Oft have I heard contemners of the passion, Prate of the soft'ning influence of love: Then soldiers should abjure it, since it seems It melts the spirit e'en to cowardice. Wyn. Edith, look there upon that fiend who taunts me! Once the presumptuous wretch—(the saints forgive him)— Aspired to the possession of your hand. Your choice and still 'tis bliss to say it—fell Upon myself. Do you repent that choice, Though sorrow is the sequence—though you hear, The name of coward hurl'd in malice at me? I would die fair in the esteem of all But chiefly you my bride; then tell me, Edith, Which is the coward—he, whose heart is mov'd To act as I did—from humanity— Or he, who like that grov'ling villain there, By lies and stratagem subdues a rival, And then, ere death can snatch him from his malice, Comes swagg'ring to his unarmed, helpless victim, And like a slave insults his misery By coarse reviling—say, which is the coward? Wil. What should I do for the great wrong I've suffer'd? Come with magnanimous condolement, or Sue for you to authority for pardon? Edith. (Falling at his feet.) Oh, save him—save him Wilton! you can do it. Be generous, and deepest gratitude— Wyn. (Raising her. Rise Edith, 'ere I curse you! Kneel to him! Debase yourself and me—defy him rather— He has no power but what grows from guilt. (Edith again attempts to kneel. Woman, dost hear me? is it not enough To bear the charge of shame—would you bring more By disobeying my command—kneel not! Edith. (Rising.) I will not. Ah, you do reproach me, then— I brought that shame upon you. Wil. (With exultation.) Still I have lived to see it: see her here— Here at my feet—she who once spurn'd my suit! Aye, you may take her hence, but still her heart Is kneeling here before me—still she begs In abject humbleness of me, your life; And thus I answer her. I lov'd you once With more sincerity than you might credit; But pitiless, you cast me off, for him Now waiting death. I then became a fiend I own it—glory in it—were your husband Now—(as he soon will be)—bound, blindfolded, The carbines pois'd, and I, by finger-raising, Could turn his doom aside, I would not do it, But wait expectant for the joyous moment To see his crimson'd corse roll prostrate. Edith. Monster! He shall not die—I'll hasten to the king, Fall at his feet, and never quit his presence Till I have wrench'd from him a pardon. Wil. Why that you'll scarcely do. His majesty One hour since set forth for Burford Edith. Alas! No, I will not despair—to Burford! I'll follow there. Ah, Edward, let me hence To Burford. I will save you, husband, yet Or perish, too, myself. To Burford, on! I must not waste one moment—on to Burford! (Rushes out, L. H. Wil. (Pointing after her. A noble-minded lady! it is hard To leave such charms for ever. Think you now, That she can save you? Wyn. Leave me! Wil. Long before She can return you'll be— Wyn. Fiend! leave me! (Wilton smiles and exit L. H. Colonel Wyndebanke sinks on seat and buries his head in his hands.) SCENE V. —A Street. Evening. Enter Wabble, R. H. Wab. Has anybody seen Mistress Wabble? Oh, my head! how disgustingly intoxicated that fellow made me this afternoon; and when I became myself—that is, when I became sensible, the trial was all over, and the poor Colonel sentenced to be shot. I wax exceeding wrath with that fellow Rip, when I think of—Oh dear, has any body seen Mistress Wabble? Yes, it's a different case when a man drinks voluntarily, but I've been made drunk against my inclination, and finally kicked out—literally kicked out—not pushed out—(I'll swear I felt the rascal's square toe at my—that is, when my back was turned)—and told to go seek my business elsewhere. Oh, that rascal Rip has behaved shamefully to me, and I dare say still worse to my wife. Where is Mistress Wabble? They told me she was at liberty as well as myself. Here comes somebody. Pray have you seen Mistress Wabble? Enter Edith, hurriedly, L. H. Edith. Oh, will you aid me? Wab. Lady, is it you? What can I do? Edith. I must away to Burford To seek my husband's pardon, or—oh, horror! He will be slain. Procure me friend, a horse, This instant, or— Wab. A horse! there's nothing scarcer, They've all turn'd cavalry recruits— Edith. Oh, heaven! Delay at such a time! I'll go on foot: My love will lend me speed, and you, if e'er You felt as one possessing friendship should— If you possess commisseration, go, Hence to Prince Rupert—plead—implore—nay, force A temporary respite, and bid those Who know and love my husband, add entreaty; Waste not one instant! Tell me, tell me quickly, Which is the road to Burford? Wab. That before you. Edith. Forget not! heaven lend me speed—it is To save his life—his life (Exit R. H. Wab. (Calling after her) But stop, I say—have you seen Mistress Wabble? Oh, lord, where can she be? I can't attend to anybody else's affairs until I have found Mistress Wabble. I know she's at liberty, because I heard a soldier say so as I was coming out—and I heard him say, too, that Horner was dispatched some distance on a commission. I was glad to hear that; it's a comfort to know she's not with him, at any rate. Enter Captain Horner, and Mistress Wabble, L. H. Eh? oh! Fiend—devil—again! Oh, my brain's on fire—why do you haunt me thus? why do you haunt my wife? There's no doubt of it now. False wife—broken vows—wronged husband —oh, oh, oh! Hor. Silence—our meeting was but accidental. Wab. Of course, viper, and I'll accidentally cut your throat. Oh, misery! why didn't I die in infancy—why was I born or even thought of? That it should come to this! Mrs. W. Come, don't be foolish: or, if you must be so, not not now. Think of poor Wyndebanke! Wab. Think of poor Wabble I don't care for Wyndebanke, when my own case is so desperate—let every one look to himself! Mrs. W. Wabble, I thought you had a feeling heart— For shame! Hor. Upon the honour of a soldier You've no just cause for jealousy. Few words Will tell the cause of my return, in which I've ventured on a serious breach of duty. I've met with certain tidings which may 'stablish The innocence of Wyndebanke. Knowing his danger imminent, I'm hast'ning To inform Prince Rupert of th' intelligence. Wab. Give me your hand. (Crosses to C.) Come, I will go with you And tell him all I know. (Looking at him and then at Mrs. Wabble.) Is it all right? I think it is—come on! We'll plead right stoutly For the poor Colonel. Are you sure your meeting Was accidental? His poor wife—(poor thing)— Is in a desperate way. It is suspicious That you should meet so often. Lose no time— Come to Prince Rupert, we will save the Colonel! No, not so near my wife—come on! (Exeunt R. H. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —A Road-side Copse. Enter George Fenwicke, L. U. E. Fen. My steed is jaded, let him browse awhile, I'm now as near the city as my safety May well permit. Here I may chance to meet Some wayfarer, who will inform me justly Of Wyndebanke's position. Horner's words Were utter'd in the flood of indignation, And thus o'er shot, I hope, the bound of truth: Yet should they prove correct—alas, alas! Why could I not foresee this misery? Why not forestate the nauseous self contempt, Most unendurable of all shame's adjuncts, Which this untoward consequence entails? Some one approaches; I'll aside and judge If it be wise to accost. (Retires 2 E. R. Enter Edith, R. H. Edith. Already faint! oh, shame—is this the bravery That is to save my husband? on, on, on! Alas, I cannot! my swoln veins will burst With dread anxiety; yet if I tarry He'll surely die—on, on! (Attempts to proceed, and sinks exhausted.) Re-enter Fenwicke, 2 E. R. H. Fen. A female—swooning! Let me aid thee. (Raising her.) Ah! Edith! Edith. George! Fen. Dear sister! Edith. No, I'm no more a sister, George, of thine; Would I had never felt for you as one And then—(Weeping.) George, George, what had I done to you, That you should load me with this misery? Fen. (Aside.) Then Horner told me truly. I've heard all. Oh, could you know the deep remorse—my— Edith. Hence! Let me away—detain me not! time fleets, And here I loiter; hold me not, I pray you! Fen. Even now you are exhausted with fatigue; Where would you go? Edith. The king is now at Burford, I go to plead for my poor Edward's life— Let me proceed, Goerge, I command you! Fen. Hold sister! hear me. I will to the king Myself. Edith. You! Fen. Yes, I will confess my treachery And offer up myself to sate due vengeance. I will so prove your husband's innocence His loyalty and truth—so strongly prove it, The king shall have no choice but pardon him. When was the time appointed for—for— Edith. His death? To-morrow morning at the hour of eight. Fen. I'll save him, doubt not: and do you return Direct into the city and prevent The consequence of possible delay In the arrival of the pardon. Go, Comfort your husband. Once more I repeat, I'll save him, Edith. Edith. Do it, and again Be my own brother, but—Oh, George, I fear— You have deceived me once, and dare I trust you! Will you be true? Fen. (Kneeling.) I swear it, Edith! Edith. Mount! Mount, then, lose not a moment! you may judge With what impatient terror I shall wait The coming messenger. Fen. He shall be saved! Think on my words and fear not. (Exit L. H. Edith. Now heaven prosper him, and save my husband! (Exit R. H. SCENE II. —A Chamber. Prince Rupert, Wilton, Horner, Wabble, and Mrs. Wabble, discovered. Hor. This I assure you is the truth; the culprit Is this George Fenwicke. Colonel Wyndebanke Is still in honour stainless. Prince R. As you think. But tell me, sir, how deem you discipline And military law have been observ'd In your return; for have you yet to learn The punishment awaiting such contempt Of trust and duty. Hor. He who but performs Duty at peril of omission, merits Small honourable trust. The punishment Due to the practice of humanity Is without shame, and therefore harmless. But as no mortal edict is beyond The reach of some exception, then, methinks The strictest law of discipline may warp To save a brave man's life. Wil. If I might speak, I'd say that naught could justify your act But the most unexceptionable proof, (Which, certes, you, a hearsay witness, have not) Of what you come, regardless of all duty, So roundly to assert. Wab. I beg your pardon; We came expressly to give testimony— Wil. (Aside to him.) Silence! Mrs. W. Nay, heed him not: speak on. Wab. I will. A gift of noble eloquence is on me. My lord, Prince Rupert, humble as I am, I raise my voice, as every manly man Should do in such a case. I say, my lord, I raise my voice— Wil. (Sternly.) Silence! Mrs. W. But we know That Colonel Wyndebanke was true and honest. Now, gentlemen, pray hear my husband tell What pass'd at Blechington. Wab. Yes, hear me, do; And to begin, I wish for— Wil. Silence! Wab. Yes; And mind you keep it. You appear unwilling That aught in favour of the Colonel's honour Should have a hearing, but once more I say My voice is rais'd— Prince R. (Loudly.) Silence! Wab. (To Mrs. W.,) Ah, 'tis useless! That noisy “Silence!” won't admit a sound Except its own. Hor. Now in few words, my lord, I here beseech you, as you have the sense Of mercy, justice, pity, be not rash In execution of the recent sentence Upon the much wrong'd Colonel. Prince R. Sir, indeed! I, doubtless, should be grateful for your counsel. Now, “in few words,” learn my determination. The hour appointed for the traitor's death Is eight i' the morning. Mark me, for one hour I will defer it, but he dies at nine. Till then, you, Captain Horner will be free— For there's a charge 'gainst you—go forth! Wilton, remove the Colonel to the cell Nearest the barrack green. Provide a chaplain, And let no other have access to him. Wil. Already have I ordered it; at present His wife is with him. Prince R. Give them one half hour For worldly parting. (To Horner.) Sir, you understand; If, before nine, you bring this Fenwicke to me, You save the Colonel. Hor. But— Prince R. I'm resolute! Place him alive before me; let me have His own confession, and your friend is free; No other thing can save him. [Exit R. H. Wil. (Following, and aside.) Soh! 'tis well! That thing shall never be! [Exit R. H. Hor. And but four hours! Oh, harsh decree! Wab. Harsh! 'tis much more than harsh; 'tis barbarous, cruel! I feel my blood rise at it. Here I stand, And care not who o'erhears me; here I stand, Firm and unflinching— Mrs. W. See, you're observ'd—an officer approaches! Wab. We'd better go! [Exit L. H. Hor. The hope is but forlorn, But still I'll mount and seek him. Miracles Ere now has heaven worked for innocence, Mrs. W. Oh, do your best! Wabble re-enters hastily, L. H. Wab. What's that? “Oh, do your best!” Come, I meant not to leave you here together. Why did you not, good madam, follow me? Hor. What, quit with such an air of cowardice? Wab. You've said it! Now I have a fair excuse For wreaking on you all my vengeance! Now My wrath breaks forth. [Turns to Mrs. W. Horner goes off, R. H. unperceived.] You think I'm a lamb, Nerveless and unresolved. But mark this hand; It trembles not, although it's doomed to do A deed of blood! Mrs. W. Pooh, pooh! Wab. Pooh, pooh, indeed! Dost treat me with pooh, poohs? And you, fair sir— [Turns to address Horner, who is gone.] He's gone! Now who's the coward? [Loud.] Who, I say? Wilton enters, R. H. Wil. Ho, sirrah! if you thus disturb the quiet, I'll place you in confinement. [Wabble utters not a word, but beckons his wife, and sneaks out, L. H. There is some truth, then, in't! I heard the tale Which Edith told her husband. If her brother Has ta'en the step she says, 'tis possible A pardon may result. Then I must stay The arrival of it; aye, at any hazard; I'll take that fellow, Rip, and on the road— Oh, here's the loving and unhappy pair; They must be parted. Enter Colonel Wyndebanke, guarded, with Edith, L. H. [Intercepting.] Stay! Wyn. Is't you again? Why will you fret me with your loathsome presence? Wil. May I not do my duty, please you? Wyn. What, What is your duty? Do it, and then leave me To be conducted anywhere you will, So you avoid me. Do your duty, sirrah! Wil. My duty is to tell you, that a chaplain Awaits you in your chamber. Wyn. Well? Wil. And he Must be your sole companion. Edith. Hold! no, no! I, Wilton—I, at least, may stay with him. Wil. My duty's done; my message is deliver'd, So let your farewell word and kiss be brief. (To Guards) You know your duty—no delay. (To Wyn.) Farewell. Now at your hest, sir, I retire—more My presence shall not blight. [Crosses L. H.] I prophecy You look your last on me. [Exit L. H. Wyn. Remorseless fiend! [To Edith.] Then we must part? Edith. But soon to meet again, And you in freedom. Wyn. [To Guards, who are advancing.] Friends—a little grace. [They retire The time speeds on. Come, Edith, let us speak Of what (should I be taken from thee, dearest,) May best advance thy welfare. Edith. [Listening.] Hark—hark, Edward, Do you not hear a distant shout—it is— It is the pardon—yes, my brother has it! Hush [Disappointedly] No, 'tis silent now; but he will come— I tell you he will come; I'm certain, Edward. Then why distress me with such false forebodings? Wyn. Look how you tell-tale cranny shews the secret Of morn's progression. If the pardon comes 'Tis well I live to prove th' injustice done me: But should it not (nay, be not so dismay'd, It may—the hours are not so dwindled yet—it may! But should it not—for there is proper wisdom In preparation for extremity— In happier, more peaceful times, when men (Now party-blinded) shall dispassionate, Look back upon the troubled scenes now acting, Then publish thou this statement to the world: [Taking paper from his breast. It is a vindication of my honour; For you must not allow your husband, Edith— Your poor, wrong'd husband (though one of a week,) To moulder in his grave, unepitaph'd, Save with a coward's stigma. You, my wife, Will find a staunch protector in my father Who, even though my claim should not ensure A place for thee within his pitying breast— Thy own just merits will; and though I leave you Still in your memory, I think—yes, yes, I know I shall live long— Edith. Oh, Edward, Edward! For mercy's sake, forbear I if you talk thus You'll kill me! [Sobbing.] Guard. [Advancing.] Colonel, pray forgive me— We dare not longer wait. Wyn. I will attend you; Edith, one kiss—farewell—be comforted! Edith. Oh, we shall meet again. Wyn. I doubt it not; Here or hereafter. Edith. Here, I know we shall, Or Edward I have murdered you—oh, Edward! (Colonel Wyndebanke kisses her—places her in the arms of an Attendant, who removes her, and exit with Guards 2 E. R. H.) SCENE III. —A Road-side Copse. [Same as Act III. Scene I.] Morning. Enter Rip, cloaked, with carbine, sword, &amp;c. 2 E. L. H. Rip. I've been waiting here and amusing myself by singing psalms for two hours, at the very least. Patience and piety support me through much anxiety, but why the devil doesn't Wilton come to me? This surely must be the corner of the road at which he desired me to post myself, and a very pretty road-side ambush it is, from which a traveller can be shot with great comfort and convenience, both to himself and the shooter; and, O be joyful! I am becoming an expert hand at giving fellows a quiet quietus—I'm becoming a practiced cheat —I call it “cheating,” for it is no more: killing a man is nothing more than cheating a man of a portion of his weary pilgrimage through this vale of tears—sela! Hark, some one comes—'tis he—'tis Master Wilton! Enter Wilton, hastily, R. H. At length then you've joined me. By my unsullied honour, I began to think you'd left me to do this little job by myself. What is the hour of the day? Wil. Between eight and nine. Rip. So late, quotha? then our watch will soon be over; if this fellow comes we'll shoot him and get home to breakfast, for sooth to say, I am both an hunger'd and athirst. Wil. You say rightly—our watch will soon end; for were a messenger here even now, with Wyndebanke's pardon in his hand, it would be fair speed to reach Oxford by the chiming of mine. Rip. O be joyful! But prithee what detained you? Wil. I was unable to leave the city; a man had been killed in brawl, and I was called on to pursue and arrest his antagonist. Rip. Oh, these ungodly brawlers! Knew ye aught of the parties? Wil. I did; the slain man is that Ticely, who gave evidence against Wyndebanke: his slayer is no other than Captain Horner— and though I had much trouble in apprehending him, curses on the fellow, he has contrived to make his escape, and is suspected to be somewhere on this road. Rip. Despair not. By the aid of prayers, pistols and perseverance, please the pigs he shan't escape. But hark—do you not hear something in the distance? Wil. Look yonder, down the road—a horseman at full speed! Rip. And lo, how he diggeth his rowels in his horse's flanks. Oh, iniquitous and unmerciful man—hast thou no feeling for thy beast? Look, look—the dust riseth up before and behind him, and encompasseth him round about. Look, look—he flieth like a winged cherubim. Master Wilton, this must be the pardon bearer! Wil. It must! and as he approaches nearer—nearer, I could swear it was—it is—it is the figure of young Fenwicke. Rip, let us fire at his horse from behind this furze. Quick— crouch, crouch! his horse, remember—down! (A pause, and descriptive music. A horse is heard at first distantly, then nearer.) Now! (They fire simultaneously.) Hit—no! by my— yes, yes, the horses rears—falls—his foot is entangled in the stirrup—'tis now free. Upon him Rip—upon him! (They rush out L. U. E. and immediately re-enter struggling violently with George Fenwicke, who is bleeding.] Fen. Villains, release me! I bear a pardon for Colonel Wyndebanke—for mercy's sake, release me! I shall be too late—too late—oh, heaven! Wll. Give me that pardon. Fen. Never! [Rip seizes him from behind, and drags him to the earth, while Wilton rudely tears open his vest and snatches the pardon.] Too late—oh, mercy he will die—wretches! [Desperately struggling, he rises, and shaking off Rip, rushes to Wilton, wrenches his pistol from him and fires. Wilton falls. Rip again drags George Fenwicke to the ground, and is about to stab as Horner rushes in 2 E. R. H. Hor. [C. holding Rip at bay.] Fenwicke—Fenwicke, fly to Oxford—save the Colonel! Fen. The pardon is there—but, oh God! 'twill be too late. Hor. Fly, fly—a moment wasted is perdition—fly! (Rip and Horner fight off, L. H.) Fen. The pardon! alas, I am wounded—but the pardon— (Wrestles with Wilton, who has partially recovered, and as George Fenwicke again secures the paper, rises and faintly struggles with him.) I have it—I have it—now for Oxford. Hold—stay the execution—the pardon is here—here! [Overcoming Wilton, as they struggle off, R. H. SCENE IV. —Oxford. An arch, through which is seen a country road, reaching to the extreme baek of the Stage. Edith discovered at the back, looking out anxiously on the road. Enter Wabble, L. H. Wab. Has anybody seen Mistress Wabble? I have lost her again! (Clock chimes.) Oh, dear, dear—a quarter to nine. Look at that poor thing there, with her swollen eyes and her poor pale face. I'm afraid it's all up with the Colonel. I'm very sorry, but I've done all I could for him. I wish I could put the clock back. I wonder if it would be any consolation to him if I were to offer to take care of his wife when he's dead? But, lord, it's more than I can do to look after my own. Besides, what would the scandalizing world say? And it really would be throwing temptation in her way, poor thing; for it's my nature to be kind and sympathizing with beauty in distress, and she might—there's no knowing! Ah, 'tis best not. Where the deuce is Mistress Wabble? (Retires up.) Edith. No—no one comes. I strain my eyes in vain. A deathly sickness casts a mist before them, And mocks anxiety. Oh, brother, brother, Have you again betrayed me? If you have, Two deaths this day lie for your answering; But still I could not wish your retribution To equal this, my present agony. No—no one comes! Enter Mrs. Wabble, U. E. L. H. Mrs. W. Oh, lady, lady—hither The Prince approaches. Let us kneel and sue— It is the last resource. Wab. (Approaches.) Oh, there's my wife! Edith. Grant me, Omnipotent, an eloquence To touch his pity. Enter Officers and Prince Rupert, U. E. L. H. Rup. (To Officers.) What reports have you? Say, is that cut-throat, Horner, yet secured? What woman have we here? Edith. (Throwing herself before Prince Rupert.) 'Tis one, my lord, Whose misery is past endurance. You, And you alone, can bid me rise in hope. My husband—save him—save him, my good lord! He merits not his death, which you will learn With keen remorse, I'm sure, when he is dead. But you will stay his doom—I'm sure you will. You are a wise and valiant soldier, Prince, And will not dim your fame with cruelty. Rup. Madam, I am not cruel; but a cause For which I daily, hourly stake my life, Demands a strict, unflinching discipline, Or else that cause is lost. I gave one hour— The utmost lenity I dare to shew— And now the martial law must take its course. Rise—rise; you plead in vain, I will not hear you. Already has the scorn of rule run riot In those who call themselves your husband's friends, And stern example only will restrain them. Who instigated th' assassination Of that unfortunate, whose evidence Prov'd Colonel Wyndebanke a criminal? That deed alone, if naught else weigh'd with me, Would make all prayer like this most impotent. (Crosses R. H. Nay, woman, hence: I will not hear you more. (Exit with Officers, R. H. Edith remains prostrate. Wabble and his Wife raise her.) Edith. All is despair—despair! For me the angel voice of mercy's dumb, And fate yells out its cruelest decree. (Drum heard. Ah, look—already soldiers are drawn out To lead him to his fate; and there—oh, heaven! There is my husband—bound—prepared for death! (The feelings of Edith overcome her. Wabble and Mrs. Wabble draw her aside. A solemn march is played, and a Band of Soldiers enter, U. E. L. H. crossing the stage. Colonel Wyndebanke is in C bound, his vest and collar thrown open. A crowd of Men and Women fill the stage. Edith rushes to Wyndebanke.) Oh, Edward, Edward—I who murder'd you, In death will soon rejoin you Wyn. Oh, farewell! Be comforted—be calm, and I die happy. (Soldiers remove Edith in a fainting state, and place her in the arms of Mrs. Wabble. The procession crosses and exeunt R. H.) Wab. (Wiping his eyes) There—there they go! they take their places—now The chaplain talks with him—a few more minutes And he'll be— (A portion of the crowd who have remained, and are at the back of the stage, begin to exclaim “A messenger—a messenger!” then loudly and simultaneously “A messenger— a pardon!” This recalls Edith to her senses, and she rushes to the back, shrieking: Edith. Oh, stay the execution! Yes, it is— It is my brother—yes, he brings a pardon! (Some of the Citizens rush out, exclaiming “A pardon— a pardon!” While the people are shouting, George Fenwicke rushes in through the arch at back, holding up the pardon: bleeding, exhausted, his clothes torn and soiled, he reaches the front and falls.) Fen. The—the—pardon—is't in time? (Edith wildly snatches the paper and rushes out R. H. while Citizens partially raise George Fenwicke, who is dying.) Fen. (Faintly.) I cannot see— Tell me—for mercy's sake—is it too late? [A shout is heard without. Wab. No, no, he's sav'd—huzza—huzza! Fen. Thank heaven! Where's my sister? Mrs. W. Here she comes—the Colonel with her! Enter Colonel Wyndebanke and Edith, she flies to George, who is fast sinking from exhaustion Edith. George—alas, you bleed. Fen. I'm dying, Edith. Do you forgive me—do you? Ah, I know My name is dark for ever. I have sham'd you, But, sister, you'll forgive my youthful folly? Edith. Oh, brother, yes. Look on me— Fen. Now I see you— But where is Wyndebanke? [Wyndebanke approaches and takes his hand.] I've wrong'd you deeply; You will not curse me—no—farewell—farewell! [He dies.] [Solemn Music. Curtain descends slowly.] DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS AT THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. Soldiers. Wabble Mrs. Wabble. Citizens. Colonel Wyndebanke. George Fenwicke. Edith. L. H. C. R. H.</field>
