      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. The Emperor Philip of Suabia. Leopold of Brunswick. Otto of Wittelsbach, Count Palatine of Bavaria. Ulric, Otto's Son: a Boy. Calheim. Isidore. Ardenberg. Hugo. Egbert. Alf. Rudolf. Herman. Conrad. Vintagers, Citizens, Nobles, Archers, Electors, Heralds, &amp;c. Adela, Philip's Daughter. Helen, Philip's Daughter. Ida of Wittelsbach. Beatrice. Ladies, Vintagers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene is in the City of Spires, the Castle of Wittelsbach, and the Rocks near the Rhine. Date, the early part of the Thirteenth Century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Splendid Hall in the Emperor Philip's Palace at Spires. A Throne, or Chair of State, at the Back of the Stage. Enter Egbert of Wolfenstein to Count Ardenberg, Hugo, Isidore, and other Courtiers. Nobles, Pages, &amp;c., continue to flock in during the early part of the Scene. Eg. A fair good morrow, Ardenberg! Arden. Sir Egbert A truant from the chase! No common cause Brings thee from Wolfenstein to Philip's Court, In such rare weather, too! If my poor aidâ Eg. How may I see the Emperor? Arden. He gives audience, At noon, in this fair hall. Isi. The time is near; Yon flock of punctual courtiers points the hour True as the dial. Eg. I'll wait him here. What news? How goes this wasting war? Claims Brunswick still The imperial sceptre? or have our bold veterans Driven the usurper from the field? Arden. Why, since Count Otto's crowning victory at Kanauâ Thou'st heard of Kanau's fight? Eg. Ay; would 't had graced Some other leader! Arden. Well! since then the war Is at a pause; a lull in the wild storm That rends the nations; and Duke Leopold, Vanquished and humbled, from a hated foe May turn an honoured friend. Hugo. That prophecy May be fulfilled i' th' instant. Sir, 'tis whispered 'Midst your Court pages here, that Charles of Calheim Is in the city, sent on embassy From Brunswick's leaguer. Eg. And his conqueror, The fiery Otto? Knoweth any man Where that proud chief abideth? Isi. He's in Spires. Scarce half an hour agone, I saw him dart Through the south gate, swift as a flash of light, His panting train a league behind, careering Along the crowded street with the hot speed Which clears the ground before him at the joust Or in the battle. The scared market folk Fled from their stalls; prim mincing damsels drew Under the eaves for shelter; screaming children Ran in the way for fear. Hugo. And he? Isi. He passed Unheeding, till three portly citizens, (I' faith, it was a service of some peril,) Caught by the bridle rein the mettled steed, Enforcing thus the chafing rider's stay To listen to their suit. Impatiently, At first, he hearkened; but the honest kindness Of his frank nature mastered his brief wrath, And in discourse as eager as his pace I left him. Arden. Hot his speed who comes to claim A royal bride. Eg. The tidings then were true; Count Otto weds the Princess? I could scarce Believe the baleful story! She's the guerdon Of Kanau's victory. Isi. Of a hundred victories Is she the guerdon, of the Imperial crown, Of love and zeal, and faith and loyalty, Which the Imperial crown would scantly pay. Arden. This youthful heat becomes a youthful knight, Topful himself of loving zeal; but we, Elder and cooler servants of that crown, Though not less faithful, we may view with dread A reckless soldier, hot and turbulent, Who, lance in rest, would sweep like some rude whirlwind Throughout a peaceful realm, so near the throne Of our great master. He is dangerous To us and to the State. Eg. Mine errand here Brings proof to enforce thy fears. I seek redress From the good Emperor for injury And insult, wrongful deed and scornful word Of the Count Palatine. Arden. Speak boldly, man. Save yon old warrior and this hasty boy, Vowed, as they say, to his young daughter Ida, No friend hath he in Spires. Speak boldly, Sir! Even Philip's selfâ Isi. The Emperor! Enter Philip, on one side, attended; meeting, on the other, Adela, Helen, and other Ladies. Philip. Gentle dames, Gentle as fair! and ye assembled peers Of the holy Roman Empire, gathered round The throne Imperial, in war its bulwarks, In peace its ornaments, I greet ye well, Princes, and knights, and peers! A brighter hour Ne'er shone upon our meeting. We expect The ambassador of Leopold, Count Calheim, With such submission as two princely foes May, in all honour, proffer and receive. Sir Egbert, thou, too, here!âour noble host Of Wolfenstein! We lack but Otto now To crown our feast. Thy blushes, Adela, Reflect that wish. Egbert, how fares the chase In the old forests of thy new demesne, In woody Brehna? When, upon the death Of good Sir Rudiger, thou sought'st of us That sylvan fief, we deemed thee fixed for life In one eternal boar-hunt, like a figure Woven in tapestry. Eg. Truly, my liege, My houndsâand none are stancherânever drove A beast of chase from the covert with more fury Than they and I, and all that I call mine, Have been from Brehna driven by Count Otto. Philip. Thrust forth from Brehna! Ade. Rest thee sure, Sir Knight, He hath good reason for this seeming wrong. Prejudge him not, dear father! Enter Otto. Ah, he comes! Father! Philip. Well, well! Our first word must be thanks To our thrice-valiant chief. An Empire's thanks Are thine, Count Otto. Otto. Keep that honouring word For painful services. To lead an army Of such bold hearts, where the very horse-boys fought Like belted knights; to feel the rapturous thrill Of battle, the fierce throb of victory In the cause of faith and honourâin thy cause, My liege, why 'tis a duty overpaid A thousand-fold in the acting. Spare all thanks, Save the shy glance which maiden modesty Lets fall through her veiled lids. My Adela, Thy prayers were with us in the combat? Ade. Yes; In very truth they were. Otto. Now blessings rest Upon the rosy lips that scorn to dally With honest love! Who would not fight for thee, Live for thee, die for thee, frank-hearted maid! Eg. My Lord and Emperorâ Otto. Ha! Art thou there, Despoiler of the orphan? When I chased thee, I and my 'squire, and some three men-at-arms, With thy vast hunting train, a score or two Of lusty grooms, from Brehna, by St. Ottocar, I little dreamt that we should meet again! Philip. He comes, o'er justly as we fear, to 'plain Of that mad feat, good Otto. He craved of us, When hawking with him late at Wolfenstein, Our Hold of Brehna, an Imperial fief Lapsed by the death of bold Sir Rudiger; And weâ Otto. My liege, it was not thine to give, That Hold of Brehna. An Imperial fief! 'Tis held, as his or mine, from sire to son, On personal service in the field; a knight's Good service to the Empire. Craved of thee! Thou might'st as well give to the first that asked The lands of Wolfenstein or Wittelsbach, Ay, and the County Palatine to boot, As Brehna! An Imperial fief! 'Tis held From heir to heir on the old feudal tenure Of service in the field; and he knew well, At cost of one poor question all had known, That good Sir Rudiger, when he fell in the front Of battle, bravely striving, left a son, A toward boy. His weeping mother brought him For shelter to my halls. I left him, Sire, Lord of his father's towers; and my good arm Shall keep him there. Forget not that, Sir Falconer! I will maintain his rights against the world. Nay, change the huntsman's boar-spear and his knife For knightly weapons, and I'll match the boy, Young Rudiger, against thee, lance to lance. Back to thy hawks and hounds! More honest one, More brave the other! Philip. If there be a sonâ Yet still respect should wait a monarch's word. Thou art too sudden, Otto. Arden. Why not seek Justice by softer paths? Why seize by force Of arms a peaceful castle? lending thus The perilous sanction of a leader's name To the rude soldier's rudest violence! Have we not laws to right all wrongs, redress All injuries, relieveâ Otto. Count Ardenberg, Law should sustain the weak; but when the strong Contend against themâYe remember, Alf, The jolly host of the Golden Stag at Lutz? A pleasant knave! He had the twinkling glance, The arch half-smile that preface well a jest, A hearty ringing voice, a chuckling laugh, And a right merry heart. Page, squire, and knight, All loved to waste an hour, and empt a flask With Alf at the Golden Stag! The hostel flourished. He bought a little vineyard, and he rode A gallant steed. Poor Alf! his bonny grey Cost him full dear. Philip. How so? Otto. A neighbouring lord, Whose broad lands girdled round his humble homeâ No soldier, as thou know'st, Count Ardenberg, But a grave statesmanâsaw and coveted The favourite steed. The merry host said No!â He would have said him No had Philip sought To buy that steed!âand then, thou know'st, not I, Count Ardenberg, how, in the mask of law, The reverend vizard black Oppression dons When she would crush the feeble, Alf was chased From his trim vineyard, his snug hostelry, To rove a squalid beggar through our streets, Whilst thou bestrid'st at ease the gallant grey. I saw him but to-day. By Heaven! I'd rather Roam the wide world that broken-hearted man, Than fill his tyrant's seat at princely feasts Or high Imperial councils. Philip. Peace awhile! Restrain these bitter scoffs. A loftier theme Demands our care. Otto. And mine. I had well-nigh Forgot my clients. Sire, the citizens Of the Free Towns seek, at your Grace's hands, Redress of multitudinous wrongs: tolls, imposts, Exactions, and abuses infinite. (Giving papers.) There be the scrolls. They say their substance flows Into thy coffers, lavished upon gauds Vain and effeminate, gems, banquets, shows, Processions, pageants, toys that babbling woman Or prattling childhood revels in, not man. I warn thee, Sire, look to it. These free burghers, As sound and generous as their Rhenish wines, Like them are somewhat rough. They will have justice, Ay, and they shall. Arden. Shall! Otto. Shall, Count Ardenberg. I have pledged my knightly word; they shall have justice. Philip. (Seats himself on the Throne.) Admit the Ambassador. We'll talk hereafter Of these Imperial towns. Enter Count Calheim, attended. My Lord of Calheim, A joyful welcome! Gladly have we hailed To-day our own great captain, bearing victory Upon his conquering helm; and gladlier still Greet we the valiant foe who heralds peace, Fair daughter of a rugged sire. What says The princely Leopold? Cal. (Giving letters.) May't please your Grace, Peruse these missives? Otto. (At the front, to Hugo and Isidore.) Peace! Hugo. And wherefore not? Otto. So, so! A peace! Hugo. Ay, good my lord. Why fought ye Unless for such an end? Say, is not peaceâ Otto. The central point of the target, sir! The ring Of the joust! The crown of victory! I can read As shrewd a descant in the praise of peace, Rough warrior though I be, as e'er a courtier That lines your halls, so that the white-robed maid Walk hand in hand with honour. Good Sir Hugo The messenger who bears this olive token Hath more of the raven than the dove. Hugo. Thou know'st him? Isi. He was amongst the followers of Leopold Who fled before us in the Kanau fight. Otto. I love a brave foe next to a brave friend; And in that fight full many an honoured crest Vailed to our happier fortune. But you minion! Look, how the ready lip wreathes into smiles! The pliant neck curves into courtly bows! Can the slave stand erect? That ever man, Born to look upward to the starry sky, To front the sun at noon, should crouch before Man's work, a tinsel throne! Take heed, good Philip! The cur that fawns can bite; yet 'tis the slaver That hides the venom. (To Adela, who with Helen has advanced to the front of the Stage.) Fairest Adela! Methinks these silken courtiers come to shame Thy ragged knight. If any jibe thee, lady, For thy rude bridegroom's sake, tell them his mirror Hath been his burnished shield; the flapping tent His 'tiring chamber. Yet i' faith he'll love thee Better than they who come full prankt to woo. Thanks for that honest smile. Philip. (Advancing to the front of the Stage.) We'll speak at leisure Of these thy missives, Count; they ask some pause. Meanwhile here be two peaceful maids to hail The Herald of fair Peace, and one bold knight To yield thee knightly greetings. Know'st thou not The brave Count Palatine? Cal. Never, till now, Saw I that pride of chivalry. Philip. Good Otto, Count Charles of Calheim greets thee. Otto. (To Adela.) Didst thou ask Of Ida, sweet one? Philip. Count of Wittelsbach, The Ambassador of Brunswich proffers thee His hand in knightly amity. Otto. (To Adela.) I left her Decking the bridal chamber. Philip. So! this passes Thy accustomed licence, Otto. Even from thee, A noble strangerâ Otto. Sire, I know him well. We have met before. Philip. Where? Otto. In the battle field. Wast thou not at the fight of Kanau? Cal. Ay; But saw thee not. Otto. Wast there, and saw not me! Why, Sire, the blessed sun shone down upon us In summer's fervid pride; a shining sight Of plunging steeds, with stern, brief glimpse of knights Smiting, and banners waving, 'mid the clang Of arms and battle-cries, and dying groans, And the loud trumpet peal. Say, am I wont To hide in such a field? Philip. No more of this. The victor turned a braggart! Isi. Even now, With generous fervour, Otto, didst thou swear A nobler foe ne'er graced a triumph. Otto. Never Was conquest dearer won. My homely speech Lacks words to grace their valour. Yet amongst The many brave, and showing the more base, 'Mid that chivalrous band, a dusky stain Upon a snow-white shield, one craven lurked. 'Twas a gay knight (Count Calheim may perchance Know the foul bird by the bright plumage), 'twas A coxcomb of the field, in damasked mail, Of such a hue as is the azure stripe Of the adder's slimy side. Blue was his scarf, And blue his waving plume.âFaugh! change thy colours, Good Count, I pr'ythee!âVainly o'er the plain I chased the recreant; vainly challenged him To meet me front to front. The coward fled. Philip. What means this idle tale? My Lord of Calheim, We must have tournaments and joustings, sports That mimic war, to reconcile to peace Our warlike knights. Thou art famous at the Ring. We heard thy feats at Worms. Cal. Dare I inquire How fares the lovely Ida, whose bright eyes Inspired the victor in the tourney game? Philip. Ay, this we heard too. Otto, thy fair daughter Hath won a noble wooer. Shall we plead Your cause, Sir knight? Cal. So please your Grace. Otto. Nay, spare Your pleadings, good my liege. She is betrothed To a brave knight;âFear nothing, Isidore! She is betrothed; and were she not, she ne'er Should mate with Charles of Calheim. Ha! dost frown? Why so thou shouldst have knit thy brows at Kanau, When I cried to thee, âTurn, blue knight! Turn! turn!â Cal. (Aside.) Otto of Wittelsbach, my hour is near! Otto. Farewell, sweet Adela! When next I come, I go not hence alone. Farewell, dear maid! Sir Hugo! Isidore! Forget not, Sire, The citizens of the Free Towns! They shall (Going.) Have justice. Ade. Otto, speak in gentler mood To my dear father. He too bends his brow. For my sake, noble Otto! Otto. (Approaching the Emperor.) We are friends? I lack the skill to sweeten truth's rough draught, But still its power is mighty. Good my liege, Truth is the pebble from the stripling's sling That smites the giant to the earth; the bolt Of the mountain shepherd's bow that cleaves the crest Of the eagle, lord of air. Resist it not. Match not my love with theirs. I was the firm And loyal friend of Suabia's petty Duke: They crouch before the Emperor. Beware The fawning flatterers! And remember, Sire, The burghers shall be tree! [Exit. Isi. (To Hugo.) Oh, valiant fool! Too honest for a Court. To strike his lance Amidst a nest of slumbering serpents, tossing The coiling worms about, as though their fangs Distilled no poison. Rash as brave! Ade. Dear father, Thy brow is louring still. Philip. We would be busy. We'll join ye in the banquet-room. Lead forth The Princess, good Sir Isidore. [Exeunt Adela and Helen, led by Isidore and Hugo, and followed by Ladies, Pages, &amp;c. My lord, Charge not upon us the discourteous scoffs Of the Count Palatine. Thou seest his mood. Ourself he spares not. Cal. We have found him long A dangerous foe, my liege; I hold him now A doubly dangerous friend. Thou art the man Whom he most injures. Why, to reign beneath This hot and haughty warrior; to fill The Imperial throne, his Viceroy; bear the ensigns And symbols of authority, the crown, The sceptre, and have none, not half the power Of a feudal baron in his small demesne; And to be taunted day by day with service Done to the Duke of Suabia; cribbed and cabined In the strait limits of another's will:â Better be a serf at once than a crowned slave, Whose fetters clink under his ermine. Fie! Shake off the chains, my liege! Be free! Arden. The Ambassador Says well. Eg. Ay, truly, Sire! Cal. Nobles, I bring Proposals from the princely Leopold To abandon his great claims; to yield the Empire; Swear fealty to Philip; render homage As Brunswick's Duke; so that bright Adela Return with him to his ancestral halls Fair Brunswick's Duchess. Full of loyal faith In his most noble foe, to-night he comes To woo his gentle bride. Philip. Nay, Calheim! nay! My word is pledgedâAnd yet a monarch's vow, His first and holiest vow is to the land O'er which he sits enthroned. Say, should we yield To Brunswick's prayer, how may we pacify The hot and haughty spirit whose fierce wrath Will shake the realm from north to south? How soothe him? Helen is promised to Bavaria's Duke, His kinsman. We must pause on this. My lords, We bid ye to the banquet. We'll discourse Anon on this high matter. [Exit, followed by Ardenberg, Egbert, &amp;c. Cal. (Going off.) Thou art mine! Now for revenge, Count Otto! [Exit. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Park or Chase in front of the Castle of Wittelsbach. Drawbridge, Porcullis, &amp;c. Evening. Otto, Ulric, and Ida. Otto. And so I scared thee yestereve. No dove, Brooding upon her nest, when her nice instinct Warns her that 'tis the hawk her enemy That hovers in mid-air, was e'er more startled Than thou at sight of me. Poor chuck! poor chuck! Ida. Thou art so sudden, father. The keen lance Hurled by the tawny warriors of the East; Or arrow twanging from our northern bow; Or swifter elements; the light; the wind; Brisk meteors shooting o'er the autumnal heaven; Stars that in winter fall, or seem to fall; Quick summer lightning; shardly match thy speed! Here, there, and back again, ere we can say He's gone! And hadst thou in good sooth, dear father, Been at the Imperial Court? Otto. Seek of them there. I' faith there be some birds, not doves, mine Ida, In that great gilded cage, who have fair cause To wish my spirit slower. I'll not vex My happy home with thought of the foul brood. How fares the loom, my pretty broideress? How The bow, my little man-at-arms? I found ye Busied as though some fay had wrought strange change Of sex and mood; thou, Ulric, gently tending A gentle birdâ Ida. His peacock! thine own gift! Why, belted knights swear by the peacock, father! Otto. Ay, 'tis a princely bird! the very type Of lofty chivalry! But thou, fair maid, Of thine own shadow fearful, what mad'st thou, I' th' midst of the court, caressing with bold hand A fiery war-horse, patting his arched neck, And playing with his streaming mane? Was that For love of me, fair daughter? The good steed Was none of mine, I trow. Ul. 'Twas Lancelot, Isidore's steed! the good steed Lancelotâ Look how she blushes!âhurt in the great fight, And left behind for cure. Look! look! Her cheeks Wax red as ever rose. Otto. An imp like thee To scan a lady's blushes! She asked nought Of Isidore. Suppose I told her, Ulric, Of a new wooer, in whose cause the Emperor Himself vouchsafed to plead? A wealthy suitor, And noble, forasmuch as long descent And kingly grants may make man noble. Ul. Well? Thou saidst him No, dear father, didst thou not? Thou didst. Sir Isidore is a brave knight, And Ida loves him. I am sure he said The Emperor No, sweet sister! Ida. Precious child! Ul. Tell her thou didst, dear father. I'm to be The page of bold Sir Isidore, so soon As I can rein his good steed Lancelot And wield my grandsire's brand. As for the bowâ Look at the top of yonder oak: thou seest A raven's nest, andâNo! come nearer here! Yon bough is in the way; and thou'rt so tall! So! So!âA nest with a broad arrow through it! Dost see the shaft? Otto. The nest, but not the shaft. The sun is in mine eyes. Yes, now I see The arrow. Well? Ul. I lodged that arrow there From Rudiger's cross-bow; the bow he gave me At parting. Otto. Thou! Ida. In very truth he did. Otto. Thou bend that stiff cross-bow! and to such height Whirl thy true bolt! Go fetch the bow. I'll see thee Shoot on the instant. Enter Isidore. Isidore, thy name Was on these children's lips and in their hearts. One boldly spake of thee; and one looked down, And sighed, and smiled, and listened blushingly. I did say No to that same suit thou wotst of, Mine Ida. Bless ye all. What brings thee hither? Isi. Thy gracious welcome, and thee mute assent Of these sweet conscious blushes, good my lord, Might bring a man from Africk. But I come On a strange message. Ida. We'll go fetch thy bow. Sir Isidore shall see thee shoot. Isi. Return Anon I pr'ythee. [Exeunt Ida and Ulric. Otto. Now, thine errand? Isi. Sir, I am sent to bid thee hasten with thy power To the Bohemian frontier, where, they say, The foe is gathering fast. Otto. The foe! what foe? Not the Bohemian! I would pledge my faith For his; and Brunswick treats with them even now. What mean they by the foe? Why, Ardenberg Knows that Bohemia, granting she were false, As I believe her true, could never fight us. Treasure she lacks and men. Isi. Dost thou not trace Count Calheim's subtle dealing in this missive? Otto. Small trust put I in him. Were not their force Utterly broke and scattered o'er the land, So that they cannot make a head again, I might, like thee, suspect it was an engine To rid them of our armies. Isi. Not our armies, But their great leader; 'tis of him they seek To rid themselves. I am not of their counsel, Their dark and crooked counsel, but men say That Calheim for his master seeks a bride At Philip's Court; fair Adela. Otto. My Adela! Tush! She's betrothed to me! They dare not, Sir; No, nor they would not. Isi. They may proffer thee Young Helen. Otto. Why, her hand is promised too, To Lewis of Bavaria. Isi. They'll not grudge A double treachery. Otto. 'Twould avail them nought. Sir Isidore, I'm past the age when boys Pine, sigh, and languish for a fair maid's love; Yet not so old but I may exercise Man's proud prerogative, to choose his mate. And AdelaâI tell thee that my tongue Stumbles at every sound save Adela. Her name to me is as a household word, Mixed with the dear, familiar thoughts of home, Of my fair Ida, of my little Ulric, Of my old faithful squire. She'd love them all, Even my rude warlike castle. There's a panel Vacant in the great gallery, close beside My noble mother's picture: I have thought A thousand times how fitly Adela Would fill that honoured place. Isi. Yet Helen's eye Is bright as Adela's, her cheek as fair. Otto. Mark me, young Sir: To me that cheek is fair Whose blushes own my presence; bright to me The eye whose modest glances frankly meet And interchange with mine. I am no braggart, To boast of ladies' favours, yet I've seen When Adela hath dropped her golden thread In fixed attention to some warlike tale From these rude lips; have felt the tremulous touch Of her slight hand thrill through my gauntlet mail When she hath given the tourney prize. No more! Thou'lt think me next as vain a popinjay As yonder thing of silk. Besides, I'd wager My life on Philip's truth. Isi. Yet arm thyself With caution. Otto. Arm myself against my friend! Sit clothed in mail at the banquet! Wear unsheathed My dagger on the social hearth! Boy! boy! I'd rather die, here as I stand, Faith's martyr, Than live to the age of man the jealous slave Of base suspicion. Hearken, Isidore! I know thou mean'st me kindly; 'tis thy care, And love for me, that make thee somewhat wrong Him to whom both owe fealty. I'll prove, Not in doubt, mark me, but in loyal trust, How vain and false thy fears. The sun is low, But we have rid together many a night Through foaming flood and trackless snow. We'll straight To Spires. I'll wed the gentle Adela Ere noon to-morrow. Isi. So she be not wedded To Brunswick's Duke already. Otto. Pshaw! 'Twill save A world of idle pomp and dull delay, Nor waste an instant should this nameless foe, Threaten our frontier. Ere my bands, dispersed Since Kanau's field, can gather round the banner, The lion banner which their lion hearts Bear on to victory, I shall be here To head them. Re-enter Ida and Ulric, with Bow and Arrows. Ah! not now, dear boy! not now! We must away to Spires. Ida can tell thee If Lancelot be fit to bear thee, Isidore, She hath been his faithful nurse. When next ye hear The horn that startled ye, 'twill herald, dear ones, Me and my gentle bride. To horse! to horse. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Street in Spires. The Houses decorated with Boughs and Garlands; Tapestry, &amp;c., hanging from the Casements. Ringing of Bells continued during the whole Scene, and Music heard during the Procession, and more faintly before and after. Alf, and several Citizens. First Cit. Alf, thou art brave to-day! Hast cast aside Thy scrip? Alf. Thanks to the good Count Palatine, I've left the beggar's wretched trade. But ye Are decked as for a holiday; the streets, too, Are rife with gay and busy folk; proud steeds, Held by fair pages, prancing at each door; The casements all alive with simpering maids; The houses covered with rich cloth of gold, Or richer tapestry; o'er every porch Garlands, and boughs, and streamers. What hath chanced? Sec. Cit. Small need to ask! Do not the merry bells Ring in thine ears the tidings? The loud peal Of trump and cornet, tell they not a tale Of royal nuptials? The fair Adelaâ Alf. Weds not to-day. The Count of Wittelsbach Is at his Castle. First Cit. The Saints keep him there, Or storms will cloud this sunshine. 'Tis Duke Leopold Who weds the Princess. Alf. Leopold! Tush! tush! Why, she's affianced to Count Otto. Be they Turned fools as well as traitors? Leave a friend, And such a friend, for such an enemy! The victor for the vanquished! Tush! First Cit. They come: Mark thou who leads the bride. [A Splendid Procession, consisting of Philip, Leopold, Ardenberg, Hugo, Adela, Helen, Knights, Pages, Ladies, Guards, &amp;c., passes over the Stage to the sound of Music, and ringing of Bells.âThe Citizens toss up their caps. Sec. Cit. Now, Alf, were we not right? Alf. The whole world's wrong, From Emperor to beggar, treacherous, false, Ungrateful, cowardly! Ye, who stood there Tossing your caps in air,âthe cornets drowned Your slavish voices,âin the selfsame place, Two days agone, ye flung those very caps Aloft, and rent the skies with deafening shouts, In honour of Count Otto! First Cit. A braver chief Ne'er breathed than the Count Palatine. So far I grant thee. But we homely citizens Were best not meddle with these great ones. She Was sad and shivering. Sec. Cit. Ay, a pallid bride! Alf. She loves him still. Enter Otto and Isidore. Otto. Alf! Why, thou look'st once more A goodly host; we'll find thee speedily A goodly hostel, man. Meanwhile, go buy A steed, and follow us, not to the wars, But home to Wittelsbach. Cheer up! Cheer up! I will not have thee sad. What music's that? The far-off music, faintlier heard and faintlier, Dying away even as I speak! And what Those bells that louder peal and louder? What May those sounds mean? Alf. My lordâI cannot say itâ I cannot frame my speech to tell their treacheryâ Otto. Wilt thou not answer? Alf. 'Tis the bridal, Sir, Of Leopold and Adela. Otto. Thou liest! By Heaven, I'd not believe my father's spirit, Though he came from the grave to tell me that base tale! Isi. Poor Alf's no liar. See how thou hast grieved The faithful wretch. Otto. Nay vex not, man! We know Thy truth. But there's a lie, a cankered lie, A rancorous, poisonous lie, that taints the air We breathe, floating around us. Thou hast inhaled The venom. Wed my Adela! Thou knewst notâ How shouldst thou know?âthe royal maids. Young Helen, She is the bride! I'd wager my broad lands Against yon withered leaf,âThey who strew roses May look to find the thorns! I'd wager, Sir, The County Palatine, if bride there be 'Tis Helen. Adela! My Adela! They could not, would not, durst not. 'Tis young Helen. But I'll be there. Alf. And I. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Interior of the Cathedral at Spires. The High Altar decorated in the Background. Priests, &amp;c., ranged around it. The Stage nearly full of Nobles, Ladies, Pages, &amp;c. Philip, leading Adela, approaches from a Door at the side, followed by Leopold, Helen, Calheim, Ardenberg, Hugo, &amp;c. Philip. Stand from before the altar, noble lords, And high-born dames, and blooming damsels! Leave Free passage for the bride. My Adela, For the last time thy father calls thee his; I yield thee to a tenderer duty now, My duteous child. The princely Leopold, Howbeit his wooing hath been brief, will prove No less a noble husband. Thou wilt live To bless the hour that rescued thy fresh youth From a rough warrior, loud and turbulent, And old as I myself, to match thee, sweet, With one in the flush of manhood's blooming prime, Who with calm sweetness tempers dignity. Thou'lt live to bless this union. Leo. Good my liege, To the fulfilment of that prophecy My life shall be devoted. This fair hand Trembles with modesty. Ade. Trembles with fear, With sad reluctance, with deep dread of wrong, With dark forebodings. Sir, this hand is pledged To one as noble as thyself. I love him With such a love as a chaste maiden owes To her affianced lord. Wilt wed me now? Oh no! Thou art too proud, too generous, Too wise, to take a hand without a heart, A cold, unwilling hand. Philip. Peace! Thou wast best. Where got'st thou this strange stubbornness? Art frenetic? Ade. Father! thyself taught me to love Count Otto. Fiery and rash! Why, 'tis the alloy of the gold That fits the metal for its use. Thy foes Have felt Count Otto's rashness, Rough and rude! So be the gnarled oak, the towering elm, Yet fearlessly the woodbine and the vine Wreathe their light tendrils round each rugged trunk, Supported and adorning. Philip. Peace! bold girl! Duke Leopold! Leo. My liege, the general weal No less than mine own fixed and rooted love Demand this union. Sweet, if firmest faith And fondest care and tenderest watchfulness May win relenting smiles, I'll not despair. I cannot yield thee, loveliest maid. Philip. Lead on To the altar. Enter Otto, followed by Isidore and Alf. Otto. By your leave, fair dames! What's here? A bridal toward? Ay; the reverend fathers, The simpering maidens, the pale trembling bride! Tremble no longer; I am here to cheer And guard thee, Adela! Duke Leopold! Art thou to give the lady? I am ready. Why hold ye back? Ye sentâalbeit I missed The messengerâye sent to summon me;â Did ye not send? or knew ye by sheer instinct, The happy star, which still hath wafted me, Unwitting how, to what I loved the best, Feast, tourney, combat, victory? Trusted ye To that fair star? or sent ye, Sirs? Speak! Speak! Stand not thus mute, each gazing upon each! Say, be ye met to celebrate my bridals? Waited ye here for me the bridegroom? Speak! Can they not utter Yes or No! Philip. Good Ottoâ Otto. Alf, thou wast right. I cry thee mercy, Isidore! Philip. Count Palatineâ Otto. I know what thou wouldst say, Ay, well I know the flimsy spider's web, The thin, weak, flickering veil of gossamer, Wherewith men shroud plain treachery. Philip. Speak'st thou, Sir, To us thy Sovereign? Otto. Sovereign! That one word Proclaims to earth and Heaven the mighty sum Of thine ingratitude! Sovereign! Didst inherit That title proud and resonant? Wast born I' the purple? Swathed in ermine? Golden sceptres Thy corals? Jewelled diadems the toys Thy pampered childhood played withal? Hadst thou The excuse that waits on princes, flattery-gorged From the cradle upward? Wast thou such? Philip. Count Otto, We bear too long thy rebel speech. Otto. Or wast thou Of the rarer race, whom patriot virtue lifts To kingly heights, who lend an age its name, A realm its glory? The great founders they Of thrones Imperial. From their ashes bursts The living fire, whose sacred halo plays Round each heroic son's anointed brow, To latest time. Giants who walk the earth Rejoicing. Say, wast thou of them? or wast thou That slightest, smallest of our pigmy race, That dullest, commonest man, that poorest peer, That weakliest tree of all our grove, whom Iâ Fool, idiot, madman!âin disastrous hour Bore on to Empire? Faugh! A puppet Emperor, Hung upon wires! A king at chess, whose moves Each subtle knave directs, each babbling jester Scoffs at and scorns. Cal. The Emperor Philip, meanst thou? That Emperor upon whose head thy hand Planted the laurel of the CÃ¦sars? Philip, Whose name hath been thy battle-cry, for whom Thou didst array one half of this fair realm Against their fellows, father against son, Brother 'gainst brother. Mark how he turns round Upon his idol, as the savage wreaks His wrath upon the image of his hand, And dashes on the stones his god of clay. Otto. Count Calheim, spare thy taunts. Philip is weak, Ingrateful, perjured, base. But what is he, That perjury's base prompter, who, a prince, A knight, a man, stole hither i' the darkâ A wolf to the fold! O stain on knighthood's shield, On manhood's brow! Isi: Count Otto, calm thee. Philip. Ay, Calm thee, Count Otto. I have borne thy scoffs, Remembering all thou deem'dst I had forgot Of love and service, thy rash angry mood Remembering too. Respect my princely guest. His coolness shames thy fire. Thou a brave warrior, Railing like some vexed shrew! Otto. I am too loud, Too rash, too fiery hot. Duke Leopold, Thou art of a noble strain. We have fought as friends Together, side by side; and late as foes Met i' the front of battle gallantly. And now I challenge thee, as knight, as man, To a fresh trial of nobleness. Grasp not, As she stands before the altar decked and wreathed, A victim for a bride. Are we not vowed Defenders of her gentle sex, protectors Of helpless innocence? Abide her choice; And thou, Imperial Philip, let thy will Wait upon hers; then if by duty swayed, Or thy fresh youth, the royal maid incline To wed thee, I, with frankest benison, Will give her hand to thine. I have sworn. Swear thou Obedience to her mandate! Kiss the blade! Swear, Duke of Brunswick! Swear! Thou wilt not? No? Off to the greensward! Better likes me there To win the dear one! Better loves my sword To flash in the sun and air. To the greensward, ho! Leo. Right willingly. Philip. Sir Isidore, guard well The gates. Close every entrance. Look that none Pass forth. Ade. Nay, nay; I am no brawler's prize. Count Palatine, a father's stern command Parts us for ever. I'll not break my vow To wed an earthly Prince. The spouse of God, A dedicated maid apart and pure, In the dim cloister's sad repose, I'll pray For peace on all. Back to thy happy home; Vex not this holy fane with strife; stain not The consecrated floor. Philip. She shall be thineâ Take her. Otto. And wilt thou take her? Wilt thou seize The victim, trusting to the sanctity Of these old hallowed walls? Each place is holy To the just purpose and the righteous cause. Wilt yield her to me? to the cloister? No! Saidst No? Off with ye! There must be but one Survivor 'twixt us twain. I'll free thee, Sir, From yonder coward's grasp. He'll not abide The glance of my bright sword. Come on! Philip. (Rushing between them.) Hold! hold! Leo. The Emperor is slain! Ade. Oh, father! father! Isi. (To Otto.) Away! Off with him, Alf! He's as one stunned And stupefied. [Alf leads Otto off the stage. (Advancing to the body.) Art sure that he is dead? Send for a leech. Arden. So, lift him up! So! so! Cal. Where is Count Otto? Where the murderer? Hugo. Gone. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Castle of Wittelsbach; an Oriel Window, through which Towers and Turrets are visible; a practicable Door near the Window, which may be supposed to lead to one of the Turrets. Enter Ida to Ulric. Ida. Ulric! Alone, dear boy? What so tricked out In lace and tissue like an Emperor's page. A dagger, tooâa real daggerâsharp As our good seneschal's, no blunted mockery. So fine, and yet alone! Thou shouldst be prancing Half o'er the Castle, showing thee to Gertrude And Ermengarde, or sallying from the gates To Margaret's cot, and bidding her admire Her nursling's gay adornment. Still so sad! Thou only lack'st a broidered purse. Take this, And fix it in thy girdleâso, boy, so!â What, not a smile? And this thy manlier gaud Neglected too! Disclose the shining steel! So weaponed, yet so sad! Ul. Tell me, sweet sister, Why am I decked thus? Ida. Lest our father come Again afore his time. Whilst sluggish travellers Count the brief hours against the weary leagues And gravely say, so long to Wittelsbach, He's here. And now he brings his gentle bride, Whom we must welcome as a mother. Trust me, She'll pay our greetings with a mother's love. Ul. Be sure she will not come to-day; or if She comeâ Ida. What then, Sir Prophet? Ul. An' thou jeer me, I will not tell thee. Ida, hast thou faith In dreams? Ida. Ah, gentle boy, 'tis all too soon For thee to hold such faith! When years shall bring Quick teeming fancies to thy midnight couch, Thoughts of shy fear compact, and shyer hope, And flitting memories, less and less distinct As slumber creeps upon thee; then should some Blest vision show before thy sleeping eyes, In vivid pageant, thy heart's waking wish, Then turn believer, Ulric; not till then, I warn thee. Ul. This is mockery. Thou know'st My peacock? Ida. Know him! There he sits i' th' sun, Look, scattering, as he waves his glittering plumes, Bright scintillating sparks of golden light, Changeful and glorious; such a light as lives On the wings of the rose-beetle. Radiant bird! Look how he sits on yonder turret! Ul. Well! Last night I dreamt that that proud stately bird, My father's giftâmeet emblem, as he said, Of lofty chivalryâwas, as he sate On that same turret, sunning his bright plumes, Pecked at and done to death by ravening crows And shrieking vultures. I cried lustily, Thy bower-women heard me, for my bow And arrowsâ Ida. But as still befalls in dreams, They were not to be found. Is't so? A dream Is but a fragment phantasm; the bright end Of a rainbow painted on one lowering cloud While the upper sky is clear. Ul. Nay, pr'ythee, listen. The bow was found; but as I fixed the bolt, The false string snapt, and the fair bird was slain Before my eyes. I promise thee, I woke Trembling with rage, and weeping. Ida. Loving boy! Ul. And that's not all. Shooting this very day At one of those vile crows, the bow-string broke As in that dismal dream. Ida. Yet there he sits Unscathed, the knightly bird! Ul. And, Ida! Ida! My lesson of this morningâRest thee sure Some evil will betide! The very task I conned for Father Cyrilâ [A horn is heard without. Ida. Hark! A horn! My father! No! The sound is tremulous, Wild, and unearthly. His quick spirit sends forth A bold and stirring blast; keen as his war-cry, Glad as his summons to the chase. Some sick Or houseless wanderer passing near our towersâ Enter Otto. Himself! So pale, and staggering. Take his sword. Thou art weary, father. Sit thee here. Ul. There's blood Upon the blade. Hast been in battle, father? Ay, that thou hast, like a good knight, and slain Thy foe. Why looks he angrily upon me? To slay in equal fight a stalwart foe Is a right knightly deed. Ida. Take hence the sword, Dear Ulric, and bring wine. [Exit Ulric. Thou art pale, and faint, And trembling, dearest father. Hath aught ill Befallen the gentle Princess that thou com'st Alone? Speak to me. Groan not thus. What grief Can equal this wild fear! Speak to me. Tell me Hath any wronged thee? Otto. Wronged me, girl! I found themâ I who, for Suabia's paltry coronet, Placed the Imperial crown on Philip's brow, Placed it and held it there, prop of his throne, Champion and victor of a hundred fields!â I found them wedding Adela, my Adela, My own affianced bride, to Leopold, Their enemy and mine. Ida. Poor Adela! And did she wed him? Otto. Wed him! I being by! My good sword in my hand! Ida, there's blood Upon that sword. Ida. Count Calheim? Leopold? Otto. No; for he rushed between. Ida. Whom wouldst thou say? Who rushed between ye, father? Who? Otto. I did not Think to have slain him, Ida. Ida. Father! father! Thou know'st what I would say! Thou seest the fear That quivers in my heart! The Emperor? Otto. Why did he rush 'twixt my uplifted sword And my armed foeman? He as well might seek To check in its mid-flight the death-winged arrow, To arrest in its swift path the thunderbolt, As to stay my keen blade when raised to strike. It was the will of Heaven, and I the blind Unconscious instrument. Why should I grieve? It was ordained above. Ida. But is he dead? Art sure that he is dead? Didst search the wound? Otto. Girl, my hand deals no second blow. I tell thee He came between me and my enemy, And as a silken scarf, a floating banner, A garment delicate as thine, I cleft The ermine. 'Twas the All-Righteous Power that nerved My arm to smite him in his treachery. Why weep'st thou, Ida? Change those pallid looks And those reproachful tears for joyous smiles! Say, âThou hast done a noble deed, Count Otto!â Be wiser than those dames whose puling fears Trouble our homes. Re-enter Ulric, with Wine. Ulric, my boy, be glad! Laugh! laugh! How knew I where the uplifted blade Would fall? Be merry. Ul. Ida, what hath chanced? Is he not sick? Otto. Be merry! Let me hear Laughter and jollity. Ul. He's angry, Ida. Father! Otto. Ha! wine! Fill high, boy! Ul. 'Tis a flask Of the rich Hungarian wine the Emperor sent thee. Quaff to his health, dear father; to the Emperor; Thine own dear Emperor, Philip; then another To the fair Princess Adela. Ida. He twists The barbed arrow in the festering flesh. Peace, Ulric! Ul. Hath the Emperor put on The haughty master, and forgot to treat Our father as his friend? Otto. Oh, I have slain My friend and master, Ulric! slain the friend Of twenty years, whom I have loved and served Even as a brother. I, who saved his life Thrice in the battle, who put down his foes, Whose soul was pledged to his by services He never could repay, the pledge that binds Kind hearts to kinder deeds, and giving hands To gifts more liberalâI, that was his all, I, to have slain him! 'Tis as though the mother Should stab the ailing child, that she had watched By day and night, since the first feeble cry Told that a child was born! I that was vowed To him and to my country, not by words Hollow and false, but deeds, pure shining deeds That might have been writ i' th' sunbeams, might have stood I' th' flood of light at noontide white and stainless, Am black as midnight now. O God! O God! That on a point of time so brief, that scarce, The sand wags in the hour-glass hangs man's all, Life, honour, name, and fame! I am tarnished now, That was so bright. My sword is dim, my shield Sullied. Ida. Be comforted. Otto. Her father, too, The true, the faithful! Hers! Ul. Full surely, Ida, This Emperor did our father flagrant wrong; He had not slain him else. Tell me the cause, Sweet sister. Ida. Brave and loving child! Who comes? Enter Isidore. Isi. Count Otto, rouse thee! Arm thyself, Count Otto! Go head thy vassals; man thy walls; heave up To the high battlements huge blocks of stone To hurl upon the foe; heat mighty cauldrons Of molten lead to pour upon their heads. There's but a moment's pause 'twixt thee and fate, And thou art dallying here! Rouse thee! He comes, Leading the Imperial archers! Calheim comes, And at his side Revenge. Mine Ida! Ulric! Ida. O truest friend! But think on no one now Save him. Isi. Wake from this torpor of despair, Count Otto! What! must I needs bid thee twice Make ready for the combat? All's not lost! Though Calheim come hate-quickened; Faith and Love Were swifter. Thine old squire and Alf ere now Have roused thy vassals. Up, and head their bands. Manned by bold warriors, these strong towers may yet Hold out 'gainst Calheim's power. Ul. They did hold out In our good ancestor Count Berthold's time, Five weeks 'gainst the Bohemians, without half Our cause. Thou'lt see how every man will fight For thee and Wittelsbach. Even IâThou'lt see That I can draw the cross-bow. Shall I call The Seneschal? Otto. My child! Oh, what a joy Had this been yesterday! Enter Seneschal. Sen. My lord, the vassals, Armed as 'gainst present danger, throng the courts, And wait your bidding. Otto. Hearken, Seneschal! Dismiss the vassals straight; let down the drawbridge; Raise the portcullis; open wide the gates; And when an armÃ¨d foe shall come, as come He will, and cry, âYield men of Wittelsbach,â Resist not; fight not; slay not; but submit. Give ready entrance; lay aside your arms; Yield peacefully. 'Tis a hard duty, Seneschal, But 'tis thy master's last command! Farewell! Farewell! [Exit Seneschal. I, that am lord of these bold hearts, I, that have led them in a hundred fields, And now in mine own castle, and afore My brave boy's face, to bid them veil their crests, And lay their weapons down! It must be, shall be. Blood weighs too heavy on my soul already; I'll spill no more. Isi. 'Twas the last chance of life. Otto. Say rather death prolonged and multiplied. I'll wait him here. Ida. Fly to the cave, dear father! Thanks, Holy Mary, for that blessed thought! Fly to the cave! There safety dwells, and hope Unsullied by a crime. Isi. Alas! dear maid! Calheim approaches. None may quit these walls Unnoted. Ida. But a passage leads beneath The walls. Count Otto knows it well, unknown To all save him and them of his high line;â The entrance is hard by, in yonder turret. Ye might spend a day upon the winding stair Ere ye could trace the groove, so quaint and cunning The workmanship! Well! that dark passage leads, After long windings, to a spacious cave, All floored with silver sand, o'er which a spring, A little sparkling spring wells ceaselessly, And through the natural brushwood, leafy screen That veils the cavern's mouth, goes dancing down The deep ravine. The place is wild and rude; Far from these towers, from human dwelling far, Save Margaret's lonely cot. Isi. The good old Margaret, Ulric's fond faithful nurse, she to supply Food until I can seek them there! Blest chance! Fly! fly! we waste the hour! Otto. Was it thy voice That counselled flight? Dost think me turned stark coward, That thou, a knight, shouldst bid me flee, as calmly As yon fond girl? Ulric, wouldst have thy father Flee, like a craven recreant? Ul. No, Otto. My boy! Hear how he shames thee! Have I not fronted Death Oft in the battle? Isi. Ay, in the battle, Death, 'Twixt Victory and Honour, stalks the field Triumphant as a bridegroom. But when shameâ Otto. I can abide it. Ida. Oh, in mercy! Hark! Is it the tread of distant steeds? or is it My own heart beating? Fly, dear father! Otto. Peace! Isi. How will thy proud and fiery temper bear The slow procession through the hustling crowd; The gaze of hate and scorn; the muttered curse, Or shriller jest, drowning thy last low prayer? And then the dismal scaffold; the grim headsman, His horrid garments stiff with gore; his hands Red from some recent butchery; he profaning, With rough, unhallowed grip, thy free-born limbs; Hacking the spurs of knighthood from thy heels; Shivering above thy head thy stainless sword; And trampling under foot the lion shield Of thy great name. He would not need his axe. Thy heart would break. Otto. Even that I can endure. Ida. I hear them now. They come! they come! Oh, father, Have pity on thy children! Fling not thus Thy life away. Isi. Nor wilt thou fall alone! Hast thou forgot The cruel law which dooms sons, brethren, kinsfolkâ Otto. The Ban! the Ban! My boy! A sword! [Horn without. Isi. There blows Count Calheim's blast of vengeance. Ida. Hasten, father! Otto. Bless thee, sweet child! Protect her, Isidore! She may not share our perils. The Ban spares Her innocent head. My boy! I'll save thee yet, My valiant boy! [Exeunt Otto and Ulric. Ida. Oh, why not take me with them! Why leave me here, the prey of torturing fear, Alone! Isi. Am I not with thee? Ida. Hark! Again, Again that trumpet! Watch if they have gained The turret. I am blind with scalding tears. But thou may'st plainly view the winding stair Through the barred loophole. If the door be lockedâ I've known it so!âAnd Calheim must be close Beneath the Castle wall. Dost see them? Isi. No. Yes, now they pass. There's Ulric's little hand, His dagger in it. Now Count Otto's plume Sweeps past the narrow opening. They are gone. Ida. They're safe! They're safe! Thanks to All-righteous Heaven! They've 'scaped the fell destroyer! I can meet him With a firm heart. SCENE II. The Diet of the Empire. A Splendid Hall; a Throne and a Table before it, with Chairs. Leopold, Princes, Ardenberg, Hugo, Herald, and Guards. Leopold advances to the Throne during the first few lines, and seats himself upon it, whilst the Princes range themselves around the Table. Ardenberg sitting on a Stool near the Emperor, as Minister or Secretary. Hugo, Heralds, Guards, &amp;c., attending. Leo. Summoned once more to Empire, not a voice Mute or dissentient, I obey your call, Electors, Princes, Peers, and mount the throne, Vacant by foulest treason. Clouds and shadows Encanopy that throne; the Imperial robes, Gory and gashed, fold round me like a shroud; The laurelled crown, to dismal cypress turned, Weighs on my weary brow a funeral wreath; Shrill wailings echo round us; even the walls Of this old Palace seem to cry aloud For vengeance on the murderer. Pass we, Sirs, At once to our great duty. Have ye cited The regicide at sound of trumpet? Arden. Sire, Twice have the heralds, with hoarse loathing voice, Proclaimed the name accurst. None answered. Leo. Know ye If Calheim have won home fromâ Enter Calheim. Ha! Hast brought The traitor? or with bold and stubborn will Defends he his strong castle? Cal. Sire, we found The drawbridge down; the gates unbarred; the grim Portcullis raised; nor hand nor voice opposed Our entrance. The old hoary Seneschal Flung at our feet the keys; yet every court Was filled with armed retainers, veterans Who would have stood a six months' siege, and then Vanquished an army. In stern silence they Surveyed our power; rebellion in each look, Treason in each fierce gesture. Leo. And their chief? Cal. Him found we not; nor the young boy his heir. The Countess Ida, sole of that doomed House, Lingered in Wittelsbach. I had ta'en order To bring her in our ward; but, while we searched From battlement to dungeon that huge pile, The maiden fled. Leo. Sound for the last time, Herald, The trumpet peal; then, for the last time, summon The regicide. Trumpets. During the Proclamation, enter Ida. Herald. Otto of Wittelsbach! Traitor! Murderer! For the last time we summon thee. Appear To answer thy foul deeds! Appear! appear! Ida. (Advancing.) Hold! nor condemn unheard! Lo! I am here To shield Count Otto's fame, to abide his doom. Could he have heard that trumpet, his bold heart Had sprung to meet the call. Leo. Retire! retire! Even this stern law spares woman's gentleness. Retire! Ida. I am his daughter. In my veins Glows the high blood of Wittelsbach, his blood Bravest of that brave race. Look ye to find Meek fawns amid the lion's young, soft doves Within the eagle's nest? Forgive these vaunts, Misery's sad privilege. I do but claim The holy right of nature, duty, love, To fill his place, now at your judgment-seat, To-morrow at the block. I know our doom. Leo. Not thine, young maid. Ida. Ye called him Murderer. Cal. Did he not kill at noontide, in the face Of God and man, before our very eyes, Philip his Emperor? Ida. Alas! he did. But 'tis the intent that makes the crime; and he No more designed to slay Imperial Philip Than thou thyself; was of that fatal deed Unconscious as his sword. The lightning flame, When smiting prince or peasant, sentient man, Or lifeless marble, knows as much as he Whom it destroys. My liege, he thought to meet An armÃ¨d foe in equal fight. His hand Was raised to strike. Had I, his daughter, rushed Between ye in that hour, deep in my breast Had the keen blade been sheathed. Oh, that on me The stroke had fallen! I had died blessing him. Cal. Ay, in wild passion's stormy gust he had spared Nor sex nor kin; had slain the new-born babe, The bed-rid grandame, his whole race; had done A score of murders in one burst of wrath. Ida. Oh, who shall say to Passion's mountain wave, âSo far, no farther!â In this iron age, Bold youth is trained to slaughter, fleshed in blood As hawk or hound. As easy 'twere to stay The falcon when she stoops upon the heron, The gaze-hound with the stag in view, as man With man, his prey, before him. War's your trade, Glory your idol. Sword and spear are now Your masters, not your slaves. Your very sports Are combats. And Count Otto! He hath lived I' the battle-field, hath passed from victory To victory careering. His keen lance Was diamond bright, bright as his fame; his shield Stainless as his clear honour. Nowâ Cal. Ay, now? Leo. Pass we to judgment, lords! Ida. Thanks, bounteous Heaven, That he is far away! that I am here To appease the law that cries out blood for blood And life for life! Pronounce your doom on me, I'll bear it firmly. Leo. Lady, we war not On women. Princes, we have heeded well The daughter's plea. But at the altar's foot The traitor raised his sacrilegious hand, And Philip fell. The regicide escaped Our archers; but the Banâ Ida. The Ban! Oh, mercy! Arden. Peace! Silence those wild screams! Leo. How say ye, lords? What is your sentence? An Elector. Good my liege, the Ban! Other Electors. The Ban! The Ban! Leo. Hear, then, the doom Of the foul murderer. Be his castles razed To the earth with sword and fire; his wealth confiscate; His lands and lordships forfeited; his name Held infamous for ever. Outlaw he And excommunicate; he and his race Sons, brethren, kinsmen, free to shaft and spear As the vulture and the wolf. Whoe'er shall yield them Food, shelter, raiment, dies. So shall they perish In woods and wilds, and their unhallowed bones Bleach in the wind and sun. Ida. Sons! did he say? Kindred! Cal. Not thou. Ida. I thought not of myself. Sons! Must thou die, sweet brother! Leo. Good Sir Hugo, Look that the sentence be proclaimed throughout The Empire. Calheim, be the duty thine Of levelling to the dust the lofty towers Of Wittelsbach. That done, pursue with sword And spear the regicide. Ida. Sons! Brethren! Kinsmen! O cruel, cruel law! My pretty Ulric! And they shall die who succour give, or food, Or shelter! Saints and angels, hear my vow! Weak, feeble, helpless though I be to tend thee In thy sad wanderings; to follow thee The wide world through in exile, penury, shame; Cherish thee living, wait on thee in death; Each thought of happier days, each dream of love, Pure wedded love abandoning; throwing by, As a silken robe, the high-born maiden's pride, The timorous woman's fear. Leo. Electors! Princes! Our grievous task is o'er. Break up the Diet. Look to the lady! Ida. Ay, I'll follow them To death. Avaunt, predestined murderer! Bloodhound, avaunt! Thou art Fate's minister, But I'm not yet thy quarry! SCENE III. The Market Cross of the little Town of Lutz. A Small Hostel with the sign of the Golden Stag at the Back of the Stage. Burghers and Country People pass and re-pass during the Scene. Enter Otto and Ulric. Otto. Art weary, boy? Ul. No, father. Otto. Hungry? Ul. No. Why dost thou ask me? Have I lagged behind, Or craved for food? I can walk yet a league Merrily; two leagues an' thou wilt. I'm strong At heart. Otto. Thy limbs are failing. We have been Afoot a day and night. Would I had left thee In yonder woodland glen! Ul. We can return there. The misty morn portends a sunny day, So was poor Margaret wont to say. We'll find Some grassy nook within that pleasant shade, And sleep at ease. Otto. If I can purchase foodâ If man, for gain, or woman for fond ruth, Will give the outlaw bread for gold. Great Heaven! And I have lived to doubt if I can save My precious child from famishing! I have sinned; Oh! I have sinned! But I am punished. Ul. Father, Thou must not talk so. Cheer thee. Why didst leave The towers of Brehna, where they loved us so, Rudiger and his gentle mother? Otto. Boy, Because they loved us so, and we loved them, I left the towers of Brehna. I'll not bring The avenging thunderbolt upon the roof That sheltered us. I seek a natural fastness Amid the rocks beside the Rhine. 'Tis near Old Rudolf's cottage. Dost remember once We journeyed thither? Ida meets us there. Ul. Ida! mine own sweet sister! Oh, what joy To see her once again, mine Ida! Enter Alf. Otto. Alf, So near thy ancient hostelry! Alf. My lord Here in broad day!âhere at the Market Cross! Away! away! Your safety lies in woods, In cliffs, and mountains. Wherefore have ye sought The haunts of man? Otto. For food. We've tasted none Through our long travel. Alf. The fair boy! I'll bring ye Food on the instant. Nay this gold is yoursâ The gold your bounty gave me. [Exit Alf. Otto. Oh, true faith! That changes not with fortuneâtender, strong As woman's love! Ulric, when thou shalt meet, As meet thou wilt, bitter ingratitude And sharp unkindness, think on Alf. 'Twill keep Thy young heart warm and glowing toward a world Where golden wheat ears grow above the tares, And purest lilies scent the trackless wild. Enter Sir Hugo, Herald, Officers, and Guards. Ul. Sir Hugo! dear Sir Hugo! Hugo. Sound the trumpets, Proclaim the sentence! Officer. Few be here, save them. Hugo. The better. Otto. He shrank from me, as men shrink From a foul leper; broke from the poor boy's Affectionate grasp, as though the deadly plague-spot Were on his wrist! My father's friend! His comrade In peace or war! My comrade, too! the friend Of all my life! O God! O God! What's here? [Trumpets are sounded, and Proclamation made at the Market Cross. Herald. Hear, men of Lutz, our sentence on the traitor, Otto of Wittelsbach, a regicide Under the Ban! Be his strong castles razed To the earth with sword and fire; his wealth confiscate; His lands and lordships forfeited; his name Held infamous for ever! Outlaw he And excommunicate; he and his race; Sons, brethren, kinsmen, free to shaft and spear As the vulture and the wolf. Whoe'er shall yield them Food, shelter, raiment, dies. So shall they perish In woods and wilds, and their unhallowed bones Bleach in the wind and sun. [Trumpets again. During the sounding of the Trumpets, Alf re-enters, and gives Bread to Ulric. Ul. Thanks! thanks! Officer. Seize yonder man; he hath brought food To him beneath the ban. Otto. The food was given To the hungry child, who hath laid it at your feet Untasted. God of Justice! hear this law, This law accurst and cursing, which conjoins The guilty and the innocent, who saves, And who destroys! Be wiser, juster, thou That com'st as Murder's stern avenger. Free Yon man, whose crime is pity; and with me Deal as thou wilt. I am prepared to die. Hugo. We come not here to slay thee. That sad office Belongs to one who compts it joy. Count Calheim Is near at hand. Bear hence the prisoner. Otto. What! Thou wilt not free him? I must stand and see My true friend dragged to death? I knelt last night Before a cross where murder had been done, And as I lay, prostrate in form and soul, Shivering beneath the spirit's agony, I inly swore to abide my doom in peace And sad submission. I thought but of racks And wheels, engines that rend the quivering flesh, That valour smiles at. This more exquisite torture I dreamt not of. God! That a man should die For succouring a famished child! should perish Because he sucked a woman, not a wolf, And drew in milk, not blood! Alf. Nay, chafe not thus. I thank thy love; but life hath little left That I should cling to. Otto. Thou shalt live. Sir Hugo, Thou wast my father's friend. A king had been Honoured in that proud title. For his sakeâ He turns away! Hearken, old man! I speak As one already in Death's grasp; the grave Yawns underneath my feet; my voice resounds Hollow as from a sepulchre. I warn thee, There be foul sins that walk in holy names; And Murder, though she take the state of Justice, And pass unpunished here, at the great reckoning Will cry out trumpet-tongued. Hugo. Lead him away. Otto. Nay, then! Alf. Oh, sheathe thy sword! I shall be safe. Submit! submit! Ul. Alf, take my dagger, man! Strive for thy freedom! Struggle with thy guards! We'll aid thee. Officer. Seize the boy! Otto. He must be bold That lays a hand upon him. Mark me, Sirs! The first that follows dies. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Feast of the Vintage near the Rhine. A Gay Evening. Scene of a Vineyard, with a Rustic Festival. Baskets of Grapes, &amp;c. Rudolf, Herman, Conrad, Beatrice, Male and Female Vintagers. A Dance as the Drop-Scene draws up. Rud. Thanks, pretty maids! Con. Nay, keep the mirth astir. Another measure, girls! Rud. Rather a song, A merry song, to crown the vintage. Conrad, Thou hast a jovial strain. The chorus of't Begins âHail to the purpleââPshaw! that's wrong! âHailââWhy, the words fly from me! One that trips Merrily o'er the tongue; and makes a quaint And pleasant roundelay of jingling sounds, Of âvine,â and âwine,â and âRhine,â enough to furnish A travelling minstrel or gay troubadour With rhymes for life. âHail to theââFie! fie! fie! My memory's older than I thought. Con. I know The strain thou mean'st. Bea. Thou hast a newer. Rud. Ha! My pretty damsel, the new strain for thee, As the new garment or new lover. Bea. Sing The old strain, Conrad. SongâConrad. The Rhine! the Rhine! the Rhine! The sun pours down his golden light O'er the broad river, full and bright, While the brown vintagers, at play, Close the glad labours of the day Beside the castled Rhine. The Rhine! the Rhine! the Rhine! Hail to the sun-kissed, wreathy vine, The bursting grape, the lusty wine, That glows beside the castled Rhine! The Rhine! the Rhine! the Rhine! No stream so fair that sun shall see, Nor hear such glorious revelry, As when, with dance, and sport, and song, Each dark-eyed maiden bounds along Beside the castled Rhine. The Rhine! the Rhine! the Rhine! Hail to the sun-kissed wreathy vine, The bursting grape, the lusty wine, That glows beside the castled Rhine! [Ida enters during the Song, and seats herself at the side of the Stage. Rud. Thanks, Conrad. Con. Why the song hath saddened thee! Rud. Dark thoughts came with it. 'Tis some threescore years Since I, a gay youth then, first heard that strain Hard by the towers of Wittelsbach; and now Those princely towers are fallen. Con. Ay, with the dust Their pride is levelled. The foul murderer's curse Rests on the land. Rud. There was I born, there wedded, There my fair children round the household hearth Sported, ay, and my children's children. There My youngest-born, my fair-haired Agnes, nursed, Herself a youthful mother, the sweet babe Ida of Wittelsbach. I dare to speak, In this black hour of fate, of them I served In the bright sunshine of their days. Count Ottoâ Con. Why name the traitor? Rud. He was my liege lord, And he is dead. Bea. Dead! Con. Ay, the deep Rhine covers The regicide. Bea. Alas! Rud. The better, child! The better! Who would wish him live? Vintager. Is't sure That he is dead? Con. His cloak was washed ashore, And his plumed casque and well-worn shield lay idly Within a foundered boat. He's drowned. Rud. The better. Female Vint. And the young Countess Ida? Bea. Welladay, For her, poor lady! Would that she were here, That I might tend upon her! Rud. Rather wish She were at rest. My pretty Beatrice, Thou hast a kindly heart. An old man's blessing Rest on thy head. Bea. What maid is this that seems So weary? Take these grapes. Rud. She hath a lookâ Bea. This is the riper bunch. Ida. I thank thy pity. Rud. The tone, too! Pshaw! 'tis fancy. Female Vint. Beatrice, We've far to go. Bea. Ay, and to pass beneath The Outlaw's Rock, where Alice vows she heard Unearthly voices, and saw ghastly shapes. Ida. The Outlaw's Rock! What mean ye? Rud. 'Tis a cliff, A ledge of cliffs a bow-shot from the Rhine. A lofty rock, without a sheer descent, Hollow within, and broken into caves, A natural fortress, where 'tis said a murderer Once kept his foes at bay the live-long year. 'Tis a wild legend. Bea. Nay, but Alice vowsâ Rud. Tush! tush! there's nearer danger! Herman sawâ Beatrice, thou'lt believe what Herman says, Albeit my grandsonâHerman saw to-day, Not two leagues off, a band of archers, headed By some great chief. Ida. By whom? by whom? Rud. Nay that I know not. But one bold and lawless soldier Were, to a fair young maiden, a worse peril Than twenty phantasms. Con. Come! I'll see ye past This dreaded cliff. [Conrad, Beatrice, and the Vintagers go off. Rudolf is following them, but is stopped by Ida. Rud. What seek'st thou? Ida. But to change A few sad words with thee. Thou know'st me, Rudolf, The wretched maid that was so happy once, Thy Herman's foster-sister. Oh, the comfort To meet again a kindly look, to hear A kindly voice! When yonder gentle girl Spake in her gentleness, I thought this heart, Which, 'mid oppression and revenge, seemed turned To very marble, would have burst at the touch Of her sweet pity! Bless ye! Bless ye! Rud. Lady, Be comforted. Can thy old vassal aid thee? Ida. Not me, but him. Rud. He lives then? Ida. 'Twas a feint Of one who loves him to elude pursuit. He lives. He bade me meet him in the cliffs, Betwixt your cottage and the Rhine. But I've Been watched, and tracked, and forced to linger long Upon my weary way. Ruo. Thou cam'st alone? Ida. Ay; Isidore beside the Princess waits, That ere she take the cloister vow, one prayer For pardon and for mercy she may pour Before an earthly throne. Alone I come; And wearily must they, if still they linger Within yon steep and barren cliffs, await My tardy steps. Enter Herman. Rud. Herman! Ida. Whence com'st thou? How Got'st thou that purse? Her. The Countess Ida! Ida. Nay, I'll answer thee anon. I ask thee now, As thou didst cherish that sweet, gentle mother Who nursed us both; as thou dost sacred hold Pity and charity, and natural love, How cam'st thou by that toy? Her. A little hand, A thin, small, trembling hand, dropt it but now From off the Outlaw's Rock. Ida. They're safe! They're there! 'Tis Ulric's. Canst thou guide me? Rud. Ay, he knows Each track of the wild cliff. Ida. We'll go at once. They're safe! They're found! Wilt thou go with me, Herman? Her. Ay, to the death. Ida. And wilt thou give me food And wine? Rud. All that I have. Ida. Now blessings on ye! We'll save them yet. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Valley amongst Wild Rocks, Bare and Barren. Otto, alone. Otto. Still succour comes not. Once again the sun, Whose fervid brightness pouring blessings down O'er all the land, hardening to golden grain The milky seed of the harvest, mellowing The luscious juices of the pulpy grape Till it burst of over-fullness; that bright sun, Whose glories mock our miseries, once again Sinks in the west. I will but wait for darkness, Then from this bare rock, where the parching beam Hath drunk the runlets dry, I'll sweep at once On man, his homes, his vineyards. Oh, to watch As I have watched my brave boy, hour by hour, Fading beside me, famishing, perishing!â I will not see him perish! No, by Heaven! They mated us with vultures and with wolves, Like them we were to die. Do wolves and vultures Behold their younglings starve afore their eyes, And leave untouched the folds? Enter Ulric. Ulric, my child, Thou hast been from me long. Hast thou again Been visiting the spring whose gentle fount This hot and merciless sun hath dried? My boy, How joyfully I'd give my blood for water To cool those poor parched lips! my flesh for food To nourish thee! Ul. I've seen what's dearer, father, Than water to parched lipsâa friend. Otto. What friend? Isidore? Ida? Ul. Ida's foster-brother, Old Rudolf's grandson, Herman. I saw him, And he saw me. I had been to the springâ Nay, I'm not now athirst, that grief is past; But if the fount had welled again, I thought To have brought a draught for thee. Otto. Thou break'st my heart With thy brave patience. Oh, that he may bring Succour! He saw thee? Ul. Yes, I flung the purse With my name wrought on't that poor Ida gave me. He'll come. Otto. Then cheer thee, boy! Take hope! take heart! We'll to the Holy Land, and win once more Name, fame, and honour. Cheer thee. Ul. I am cheery. I have good cause to be so. Tell me, father, They that have never sinned, other than all Sin in the sight of angels; they who die Too young for mortal crime to tarnish quite The innocence that's born with them; they'll go To heaven? Otto. Yes, yes. Ul. And they that having sinned Repent? Otto. They also. Ul. Well, is that no hope For me, for thee? Otto. O God! O God! Ul. Have patience Thou that for thine own suffering takest no heed. Grieve not for mine. Hunger and thirst are dead Within me now. I have no pain. I'm light And strong. Otto. Ay, as the momentary flash Of the expiring lamp; the strength that grapples With Death a breathing space, then drops. Ul. Good father, When Herman comes, we'll home to Wittelsbach. I know its towers are fallen, but the trees, The running waters, and the pleasant lawns Be there. The home where we have lived in peace And love, oh! that's the holiest land! We'll find Shelter amid the ruined halls. Otto. Accurst For ever be the moody, wild despair Which drove me from those walls in cowardly flight! We should have held out 'gainst a legion, fought Till none was left to slay, till not a stone Of that vast pile but tottered. Then 't had fallen Graced with a hecatomb of friends and foes, Fit grave of our great race. A sepulchre So stern and warlike 't had outvied the tombs Of Eastern monarchs by the slimy Nile, And made the huge and mystic Pyramids Seem slight and trivial toys. NowâYes, 'tis meet We go there. So the hunted stag returns To his old lair to die. SCENE III. Enter Ida and Herman, from above, to Otto and Ulric among the Rocks. Otto. Ida! my child! What means this breathless speed? What ails thee, youth? Her. My lord, we are pursued; Ye are discovered. A foe climbs even now The rock's steep side. Ida. Alas! sweet brother! Otto. Peace! Is that foe near? Her. Midway the winding-path. Otto. Alone? Her. Alone. Otto. Alone! what fear'st thou, then? Be we not warned? And is not this the sword That oft for life, or fame, or loyalty, Hath swept the battle-field? Say, what were life? A breath;âor fame? a bubble;âmatched with ye, My dear ones!âmy thrice dear ones! Ul. Ida, sister, Thou art too fearful. Some poor peasant swain Wandering among the rocksâ Her. My lord, 'tis one Of Calheim's archers, whose main band is now Dispersed about the plain. I've known him longâ A neighbour's son, bold, crafty, covetous, From his youth up. Show him but gold, and Caspar Will neither blench at peril nor at sin. He hath heard tell of voices and dim shapes Around the Outlaw's Rock, and comes alone To seize or mark the prey. Otto. Why, let him come. Deem they my right arm palsied, that a churl, A serf, should breast Count Otto? Why didst not Shoot him at once? Her. My lord, I raised my bow, But soon as he espied it, he, too, raisedâ Ul. His bow? Her. A fearfuller weapon. To his lips A horn he lifted; that once windedâPlease thee Retire into the cave with Lady Ida; I'll watch him from above; and if he come, Spring thou at once upon him. Otto. I to hide In dens and caves! Ida. Oh, father! Otto. Get thee in, Poor child! I will but place her safely, then Return to share thy watch. [Otto and Ida retire into the Cave. Herman mounts the Rock, followed by Ulric. Ul. Is Caspar clad In armour? Her. No. His garb is slight as mine, Fit to ascend the toilsome path. Ul. (Playing with Herman's Bow and Arrows.) This bow Is trim and light. Let's see the arrows. So! They're deftly feathered. I have bent a bow At Wittelsbach. Her. And shalt again. Ul. (Looking off the Stage.) Will Caspar Come by this track? Her. He must. Ul. And fix his eyes Upon the path? Her. Sooth, he were best, who treads A road so perilous. Ul. He cannot come Upon us from behind? Her. No. Wherefore ask'st thou? Dost fear? Ul. Fear! Nay, good Herman, I meant not Reproach. I'm but a poor weak boy, half dead Of grief and famine. What have I to fear? (To himself mutteringly.) A man is bigger than a raven's nest, A nearer mark, too! (Aloud.) Thou art sure he comes This way? Her. Full certain. Thou may'st wander there In safety, pretty child. Enter Otto from the Cave. Otto. Dost see him, Herman? Comes he? To bide within there, as a hind, Chased by the hunters, couches in the covertâ I, an old warrior! Oh, the iron presses Into my soul! Or viler still than that Vile cowardice, to lurk within my den, Stealthy and crouching, as the spotted pard Or streaked tiger, and so spring unseen On the defenceless wretch! One man! I'll front him At once, and boldly, Her. Now he comes. He sees usâ The horn is at his lips! Ul. (Shooting off the Stage.) Die! Her. Look, he reels! He falls from rock to rock! He's dead! 'Twas sure An arrow from above. Ul. I shot him, father! Otto. My boy! Mine own brave boy! Enter Ida. 'Tis he has saved us. Ida. See how he droops his head upon my breastâ Feel how that bold heart pants. Rouse thee, sweet brother! Otto. This deed hath shaken in his glass of life The sands that ran so low. My child! my child! My valiant child! Ida. He speaks; he fain would rise. What wouldst thou, Ulric? Home? We have no home! Ul. To Wittelsbach. Otto. A fitting palace that For Famine and her bridegroom Death. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Ruins of the Castle of Wittelsbach, blackened by fire, and razed in many places nearly to the ground; only a few buttresses standing. Otto leaning over Ulric, dead. Otto. Ha! did he move? No! no! Dead! dead! Cold! cold! 'Twas my fierce breath that stirred the clustering curls On the pale forehead, still and heavy now, Damp with the chilly death-dew. The small hand Whose last faint pressure, when the feeble speech Was quenched, still spake of love unquenchable, That little hand falls lifeless from my graspâ A lump of stiffening clay. My boy! my boy! Gentle and brave! To die! and so to die! Without a roof to shelter thee, or food, Or needful raiment; the cold earth thy bed, And howling wind and rain and arrowy hail Beating around thee in the last long hour! Yet not the pitiless elements, 'gainst them His bold heart battled bravely, did to death The valiant child. He died of grief and shame, The slow sure poison of much misery. Ha! some one comes. Is't Ida? No, a man! Men, by the echoing footsteps! I'll not leave The corse to birds obscene and ravening wolves. No! no! I'll stay. What should I fear? Why, Fear, Dark trembling phantom, linked to radiant Hope As the shadow to the sunshine, Fear belongs To life. I am death's watcher. [Enter Alf and another poor Citizen from the Ruins; Alf speaking as he enters. Alf. 'Tis in vain, Good comrade! Here's no treasure. Let's begone! 'Tis sad to look upon these huge grim walls, Once firm and stable as the rocks and hills, Now scathed and overthrown; sadder to think On him, the bold, the kind, who never heard Of want but succour followed. Otto. Who is that That dares commit a charitable sin, And name without a curse a wretch accurst? Alf. The Count of Wittelsbach! Otto. I am he that once Bore that proud title. Wittelsbach and I Alike are fallen. What! Alf! alive and free! They do not then all die who pity us! How didst thou 'scape? Alf. An archer of the guard Freed me for the sake of his old chief. My lord, There be true hearts would rally round thee still; Few love the Emperor; all abhor Count Calheim; Draw but thy sword, set but thy lance in restâ Otto. What! be again a soldier and a knight! Taste the keen joy of the combat! Mix once more Beloved and honoured midst my fellows! live Blessing and blest! Oh, mockery! I stand here In the palace-home of centuries, which seemed Eternal as our race, now like our race A yawning ruin. At my feet the heir Of our proud name, gone like that name. For me There is nor Past nor Future. Alf. The poor boy! The noble, gallant boy! Otto. Thou must away, They must not find thee here. What brought thee, Alf? Alf. Poverty, good my lord. My honest neighbour Hath lost his little all, and came to dig For treasure in these vaults. Otto. For treasure? Alf! Didst never hear from fond and babbling age The annals of our race? How my great-grandsire, Count Berthold, emptied chests of coinÃ¨d gold And pledged his lands to raise and arm the people, Ay, a whole people, burghers, franklyns, serfs, In the Bohemian wars? Or how his son Melted his silver vessels, even the chalices Of our old chapel (sacrilege, the priests Miscalled the deed), to feed the starving poor In the great famine? Or how my good mother, The Countess Bertha, when a ravaging fire Burnt half the city, sold her jewelled chains And strings of pearl and glittering carcanets To clothe the shelterless? We had no hoards In Wittelsbach. The treasures of our house Were in its archives, in the knightly name, Pure, stainless, bright, which Iâwhich my foul crime, My frenzyâTake this gold; 'tis all I have, I need it not. I shall not need it. Go. Alf. Now blessings on that noble head! Citizen. My children Shall pray for thee. Otto. Go! [Exeunt Alf and the Citizen. Did he talk of blessings? There is good need that one should pray for me; For as I bend over the newly dead, All uncompanioned save by mute despair, Here on my ruined hearth, the murderer's curse Tugs at my heartstrings, fires my burning brain, Throbs in each throbbing pulse. What's here? A mattock! I will go dig our graves. Enter Ida. Ida. The cave is now Prepared, dear father. How is he? I left Poor Margaret weeping betwixt grief and joy; Poor faithful Margaret! She would fain have come To tend upon us here. Might we not move him To her trim cottage? Sleeps he still? Speak, father! Otto. Ida, if thou have pity, call me not Father! The very sound stabs like a sword. Call me the thing I am, girlâmurderer! Regicide! Call meâNo; there is no word For my unparagoned sin. The mind of man When fashioning the myriad sounds that lend A winged life to Thought, ne'er framed a name For the slayer of his children. I was born To be that first worst murderer. Ida. Alas! Then he is dead, mine own sweet brother! Otto. Ay; Even as an oak stricken by the thunderbolt, Whose fall hath crushed the tender sapling. Thee The cloister shall protect; or Isidoreâ Ida. Oh, never, never! Talk not of him, father! I will not leave thee. None shall sever us; Not even thyself. I'll cling to thee in life, In death; as the ivy wreathes its living cords Around the fallen oak. I'll follow thee Through the wide world; tend on thee; comfort thee; Make a home for thee in the savage woods, Or the caves of the sea-shore. Oh, look upon me As thou wast wont! Bury not in his grave All love! Hold me not from thee! Scorn me not! I am thine own poor child. Otto. Oh, bruisÃ¨d flower, Whose odorous perfumes breathe their balmiest sweets Around the foot that crushes thee! bright star, Whose quivering, trembling lamp holds out her light To cheer and guide in misery's darkest hour! My child! my Ida! all that fate hath left To this poor heart! Forgive me, best and dearest! Forgive me, mine own Ida! Thou didst love him Even with a mother's tenderness;âand heâ Oh, how he loved thee, Ida! his young nurse, When, tottering beneath the stout babe's weight, Thou'st held him up to view the dazzling helm Which fixed his infant gaze; and I have stooped To place in reach of his uncertain grasp My drooping plume;âDost thou remember, Ida?â From that time downward even to the day When the bold boy first strove to draw my sword, And swore that he would challenge knight and peer In honour of his sister, his fair sister, Thou wert the cherished idol of his soul, The vision of all goodness and all beauty. And I, for his sake who for my foul sin Lies dead before mine eyes, and for thine own, My best beloved, most precious, do abjure For ever thy dear presence, do renounce Thy filial duty; severing each link Of the golden chain of love, sweet, gracious words And patient smiles, and fond and hopeful looks, Relics of Paradise, I give up all In thee. Here lies one victim. Make me not Thy murderer, Ida! The ban leaves unscathed Thy innocent head. Go from me. Bring not down Fresh sins upon my sinful soul. Go from me, My precious child, my all! Ida. Oh, father! father! I cannot speak. Let my tears plead for me, For me and for thyself. We'll go together. We will not part. Otto. I dare not bless thee, Ida! Blessings from me the accurst would turn to curses. But there is One who reads the broken heart, Who heeds the unspoken prayer. His blessing rest Upon thee, my fair child. At night we'll seek The Abbess of St. Agatha. Watch now Beside the tranquil dead. I go to dig His grave amid these frowning buttresses, These half-discovered vaults, which like some huge Ancestral tomb stand yawning to receive Their master's fated race. Bide here. I go To seek amid our desolated home Earth's last best resting-place. [Exit Otto. Ida. No; I'll not leave him; I'll never leave him.âUlric! Oh, how calm! How beautiful! how pure! The holy smile That lingers on those lips reflects the bliss Of the freed spirit. I'll go seek for flowers, The pale, dim woodbine, the faint Autumn rose, And lingering spikes of odorous lavender To strew upon the corse. Flowers wet with tears Are all I have, are all the mightiest have To deck the loved-one's bier. The sepulchre, Awful and stern, rejects wealth's tinsel gauds, And in her silent womb receives alone The simple offering prince or serf may cull From upland pasture or deep woody glen. Enter Calheim, speaking to an Officer. Cal. Look that the archers close around the walls, Watching that none escape. Wait thou beside Yon buttress. Ay, 'tis she. Our search is o'er. [The Officer retires, and Calheim advances to Ida. Should I not know that form, albeit the robes Of cumbrous pomp no longer idly shroud The light and delicate grace of springy youth? Should I not know that face, albeit none ever Saw the fair cheek so pale? The Countess Ida. Turn not away. I've sought thee, lady, long, And must have speech with thee. Where dwellest thou? Where is thy home? Ida. Alas! I have no home, A houseless, lonely wanderer. Cal. Lonely? Ida. Ay; A solitary wanderer. Cal. And thy father? Why dost thou start, fair maiden? I but ask thee Where bides Count Otto? Speak. Ida. Hast thou not heard The piteous tale, that in the swollen Rhine A broidered cloak, bearing the lion crest Of Wittelsbach, a draggled heron plume, Such as still decked his knightly helm, were found Floating upon the wave? Cal. The broidered cloak! The heron plume! Thou art ill at feigning, lady; Thy fair cheek changes not; thine eye is calm; Thy voice unfaltering. Not in such a tone Speaks a fond daughter of a father dead. He is not drowned; he lives; we've tracked him hither; He lurks within these walls. Why, now thou tremblest; Thine eyelids quiver now; and the flush of fear Mounts to thy temples. He is here. Ida. Count Calheim, Be merciful! Have pity on us! Save him! My tongue cleaves to my mouth. I have no words, I am weaker than a child. Fear takes from me All power of thought or utterance. Only save him! As thou didst love thy father, as thou hop'st For children that shall love thee in thine age, Save him! Cal. Arise. Ida. I'll never leave thy feet Till thou hast sworn to save him. Wouldst thou slay A father 'fore his daughter's eyes? The headsman, Rude and unnurtured as his axe, would shrink From such a butchery. Draw off thy band, Thou canst an' if thou wilt, and my whole life Shall be one prayer for thee. Oh, save him! save him! Cal. Listen. Thyself, and only thou, canst save Count Otto. Ida. I! Now blessings on thy head Thou art a good man, Charles of Calheim. Blessings On thee and thine! Out on my foolish fear! Fie on me that I tremble so. Speak! Speak! Cal. Calm thee and hearken. At the tournament Of Worms I saw and loved thee; and when sent, The Ambassador of Leopold, to Spires, I asked thee of thy father; and with taunt, Bitter and gross, with jibe and contumely, Was my frank offer spurned. Had some vile groom Or viler criminal sought of Count Otto His daughter's hand, he could not have flung off Bondsman or thief with fiercer scorn. Nay, listen! My story shall be brief. The Counts of Calheim Have still been known to keep an equal reckoning With friend or foe. We are no ingrates, lady; We pay our debts of good and evil, blessing For blessing, curse for curse. I inly swore A deep and lasting vengeance; and with aid Of man's blind passions, cold, smooth treachery, And rash, hot choler, I have drunk to the dregs Revenge's bitter sweets. The haughty knight, Who flung his biting scoffs at me, as boys Pelt curs with pebble-stones, what is he now? A regicide. The scathing, withering ban, That cuts man from his fellow-man, hath smitten Him and his house. Vengeance is satiate now, And Love may revel. Ida. Love! thy love! Cal. Nay, snatch not Thine hand from mine, fair Ida: lovelier far In grief and terror than in hope and joy! Snatch not away thy hand. Be wise, and save The guilty and the innocent, Count Otto And his fair boy. Ida. He is beyond thy power. And I, even now, with vain and sinful tears Bemoaned his death. He is at rest. Cal. Thy father! Ida. He would not be so saved. Off, torturing fiend! Destroyer of our race! This is not love, But hate. Thy look is fearful, man! Hold off! Approach me not. Avaunt! Cal. Hast thou forgot The Imperial archers? They await my call, And know their duty. Once again I ask thee Be mine. Ida. Oh, never! Cal. In thine own despite I'll bear thee to a happier destiny. Enter Otto. Otto. Didst call me, Ida? Heard I not a cry Of terror and of anguish? Miscreant, turn! Though my good arm were withered, my keen sword Blunted, this causeâHa! is it thou, Count Calheim? Thou hast tracked the quarry to his lair. So be it. I know my doom. But an' thou touch a hair Of her fair head, thou'lt find me still a man, Ay, and a father. Dost thou brave me here, Here in my old hereditary home? Cal. Thy home! 'Tis forfeit to the empire. Otto. Thou Didst see these strong towers crackle and consume Beneath thy stronger fires. Thy heavy axe Joined the devouring flame that blazed and roared From turret to foundation-stone, till heaven Blushed, and earth trembled, as each mighty tower, An age's boast, fell prostrate. That fierce flame, Bright minister of man's revenge, hath yet A power beneficentâay, even as death, To enfranchise and to consecrate. It frees Whom it destroys. No feudal lord shall rule In these old feudal halls. Long waving grass, Bramble, and briony, and pungent flowers Shall fringe the crumbling walls. The hare shall couch Beside the ruined hearth; the hill-fox hide Within the deep recesses; the stern outlaw Find in these vaults a tomb. Thou hast sought me here Amidst the black and devastated walls, That once were Wittelsbach. Didst think to pass Safe from the lion's den? Thou hast found me digging A grave for my fair boy, my famished boy, My one fair, famished boy!âDidst think to 'scape The mountain eyrie, where the eagle shrieks Over his slaughtered young? Come on, Count Calheim! I called thee coward once;âforgive that wrong! Thrice valiant he who singly dares to brave Me and my great despair. Come on. Away, girl! Cal. Put up thy sword. Otto. Off with thee, Ida!âNow!â Now!âHe's a coward still. Cal. Dar'st thou to challenge A knight of the empire? Thou, with 'scutcheon burnt, And banner torn, and broken spurs, and name Degraded! Sir, the Emperorânot thine Emperor, Thy master and thy friend;âShak'st thou at that? Not he, for he is dead;âWho trembles now? But Leopold of Brunswick sent me hither To do quick justice on a famous traitor Under the ban. Dost mark me, Sir? a murderer! A regicide! Thou art begirt with foes; The Imperial archers wait within my call To seize thee. Otto. Summon them; and see if then I tremble.âIda! sweet one, hang not thus Around me. Sit thee down and listen, Ida, To my last words. When I am gone, or nowâ This very nowâ Ida. Father, 'twas I betrayed thee! Otto. Vex not thy gentle heart with thoughts like these, But listen and obey. Haste with all speed To the convent of St. Agatha; the Abbess Will shield thy tender youth. Beseech her, Ida, For love of thy dear mother, that her son May rest in hallowed earth, with holy dirge And pious requiem. Crave nought for me; My bones must whiten in the wind and sun Unblest. But sometimes in thine inmost heart Thou'lt think of me; and such mute thoughts are prayers That mount to heaven seraph-winged. Go! go! Ida. Father, 'twas I betrayed thee! I, thy child, That called thee here to die. Cal. Ay, that sweet voice Hath done a royal service; hath brought forth A criminal to justice; those bright eyes Shall see the righteous doom. Ida. Oh, mercy! mercy! Cal. Thou still may'st save him. Wed me, and yon bandâ Ida. Wilt thou dismiss them? Wilt thou save him? Father, I cannot see thee die! I have bethought me; Hearken, Count Calheim! I will be thy bride. Otto. Sooner wed Death, the crownÃ¨d skeleton, That banquets with the worm: famished as he, Thy pretty brother, stabbed as I shall be; Or with thy full heart bursting even here, At sight of that last agony. Wed Death In his most ghastliest form rather than lust And cunning craft, and cowardly cruelty. Count Calheim, call thy archers. Cal. Nay, thou hear'st The maiden hath consented. Otto. Demon, see! She lies as one from whose frail form the spirit Hath newly passed away. Oh, fondest! faithfullest! That so thou wert! That the poor heart were dead To grief and fear! Summon thy band. Dost linger? Dost palter with thy duty? Must I show thee To serve thy Emperor? Ho! brave archers! Warriors Of Brunswick and the empire! Veterans Of Philip and of Leopold! What ho! I summon ye to vengeance. Enter Soldiers, &amp;c. Ye are sent To seek and seize Otto of Wittelsbach, Traitor, and murderer, and regicide, Under the ban. He hath deserved his doom. But what may he deserve, the double traitor, Your craven leaderâStruggle not; I clutch thee In a grip as strong as death!âwho, not for pity, But base and brutish passion, strove to save The wretch he came to slay, to evade the law He swore to execute, to abet and succour The excommunicate? Say, for ye know me, When you shall tell your children my sad tale, That I denounced the traitor, I, Count Otto; And 'twas my sword that wreaked Heaven's mighty justice On him and on myself. As Otto stabs first Calheim and then himself, Isidore enters with Alf and Attendant, seizes Ida in his arms; and the Curtain falls.</field>
