      <field name="fulltext">Sound a Signate and passe ouer the stage. Enter at one dore The king of Spaine, Duke of Castile, Duke medina, Lorenzo, and Rogero: at another doore, Andrea, Horatio, and Ieronimo, Ieronimo kneeles downe, and the King creates him marshall of Spaine: Lorenzo putes on his spurres, and Andrea his sword, the king goes along with Ieronimo to his house, after a long Signate is sounded: Enter all the nobles, with couerd dishes to the banquet. Exit Omnes. That done Enter all agen as before. Spai. Frolick Ieronimo, thou art now confirmd, Marshall of Spaine, by all the dewes And customary rights vnto thy office. Iero. My knee sings thanks vnto your highnes bountie, Come hether boy Horatio, fould thy ioynts, Kneele by thy fathers loynes, and thank my leedge, by honering me, thy Mother, and thy selfe, with this high staffe of office. Hora. O my leedge I haue a hart thrice stronger then my years, and that shall answere gratefully for me. Let not my youthfull blush impare my vallor, If euer you haue foes, or red field scars, Ile empty all my vaines to serue your wars: Ile bleed for you: and more, what speech afords, ile speake in drops when I do faile in words. Iero. UUell spoke my boy, and on thy fathers side. My leedge how like you Don Horatios sperit, what, doth it not promise faire, Spai. I and no doubt his merit will purchase more, Knight Marshall rise, and still rise Higher, and greater in thy Soueraines eies. Iero. O fortunate houre, blessed mynuit, happy day, Able to rauish euen my sence away, Now I remember too: O sweet rememberance, This day my years strike fiftie, and in Rome, They call the fifty year the year of Iubily, The mery yeare, the peacefull yeere, Iocond yeare, A yeere of ioy, of pleasure and delight, This shalbe my yeare of Iubily, for tis my fifty. Age vshers honor, tis no shame, confesse: Beard, thou art fifty full, not a haire lesse. Enter an Embassador. Spai. How now, what news from spain, tribute returnd. Embas. Tribute in words my leedge, but not in coine. Spai. Ha: dare he still procrastinate with Spaine, Not tribute paied, not three years payed, Tis not at his coine But his slack homage, that we most repine. Iero. My leedge, if my opinion might stand firme Within your highnes thoughts: Spai. Marshall, our kingdome calles thee father: Therefore speake free Thy counsell ile imbrace, as I do thee. Iero. I thanke your highnes: then my Gracious leedge, I hold it meete by way of Embassage, To demaund his mind and the nectlect of tribute: But my leedge heere must be kind words, Which doth oft besiedge the eares of rough Heawn tyrants more then blowes. Oh, a polyticke speech beguiles the eares of foes, Mary my leedge mistake me not I pray, If friendly phraises, honied speech, bewitching accent, Well tuned mellody, and all sweet guifts of nature, Cannot auaile or win him to it, Then let him raise his gall vp to his toong, And be as bitter as physitions drugs, Stretch his mouth wider, with big swolne phrases: Oh heeres a Lad of mettle, stout Don Andrea, Mettle to the crowne Would shake the kings hie court three handfuls downe. Spai. And well pickt out knight Marshall, Speech well strung, Ide rather choose Horatio, were he not so young. Hora. I humbly thanke your highnes, In placing me next vnto his royall bosome. Spai. Now stand ye Lords to this election. Omnes Right pleasing our dread Soueraigne, Medi. Onely with pardon mighty Soueraigne. Casti. I should haue chose Don Lorenzo. I Don Rogero, Rog. O no, not me my Lords; I am wars Champion, and my fees are swords, Pray king, pray peeres, let it be Don Andrea, Hees a worthy lim, Loues wars and Souldiers therefore I loue him. Iero. And I loue him, and thee valliant Rogero, Noble spyrits, gallant blouds, Your no wise insinuating Lords, You ha no tricks, you ha none of all their flights. Lo. So, so, Andrea must be sent imbassador, Lorenzo is not thought vpon: good. Ile wake the Court, or startle out some bloud. Spai. How stand you Lords to this election. Omnes. Right pleasing our dread Soueraigne. Spai. then Don Andrea. Add. My aproued leedge. spai. UUe make thee our Lord hie imbassador. and. Your highnes cirkels me with honors boundes, I still discharg the waight of your command, with best respect, i friendly tempred phraise, Cannot affect the vertue of your charge, I will be hard like thunder, and as rough, as Northerne tempests, or the vext bowels, Of too insulting waues, who at one blow, Fiue marchants wealths into the deepe doth throw, ile threaten crimson wars. Roge. I, I, thats good; Let them keepe coine, pay tribute with their bloud. spai. Farwell then don Andrea, to thy chardge Lordes letes in, ioy shalbe now our guest, Lets in to celebrate our second feast. Exit Omnes. manet Lorenzo Solus. Lor. Andrea's gone embassador, Lorenza is not drempt on in this age, Hard fate, when villaines sit not in the highest state Ambitions plumes that florisht in our court, Seuere authority has dasht with iustice, And pollicy, and pride, walke like two exiles Giuing attendance, that were once attended, and we reiected that were once high honored, I hate andrea, cause he aimes at honor, when my purest thoughts, work in a pitchy vale, which are as different as heauen and hell, One peeres for day, the other gappes for night, That yawning Beldam with her Ieltie skin, Tis she I hug as mine effeminate bride, For such complexions best appease my pride: I haue a lad in pikell of this stamp, A melancholy discontented courtier Whose famisht iawes look like the chap of death, Upon whose eie browes hang damnation, Whose hands are washt in rape, and murders bould, Him with a goulden baite will I allure, For Courtiers wil doe any thing for gould, To be Andrea's death at his retourne: Hee loues my Sister; that shall cost his life, So shee a husband, he shall lose a wife, O sweete, sweete pollicie, I hugg thee, good: Andreas himens draught, shallbe in bloud. Exit. Enter Horatio at one doore, Andrea at an other. Hora. Whether in such hast my second selfe. And. I faith my deare bosome, to take solemne leaue, Of a most weeping creature. Hora. Thats a woman. Enter Bellimperia. And. Thats Bellimperia. Hora. See see, she meetes you heere: And what it is to loue? And be loued deere, Bell. I haue hard of your honor gentle brest, I do not like it now so well me thinkes. And. What, not to haue honor bestoued on me. Bell. O yes: But not a wandring honor deere, I could afford well didst thou stay here, Could honor melt it selfe into thy vaines, And thou the fountaine, I could wish it so, If thou wouldst remaine heere with me: and not go. And. Tis but to portugale. hora. But to demand the tribute Ladie. Bel. Trybute, alas that Spaine, cannot of peace Forbeare, a little coine, the Indies being so neere, And yet this is not all: I know you are to hot, to full of spleene for an imbassador, And will leane much to honor. and. Push. Bel. Nay heare me deere; I know you will be rough And violent, and portingale hath a tempestus son, Stampt with the marke of fury, and you too. and. Sweet Bellimperia. Bel. Weele meete like thunder, catch imperious ouer Others spleen you haue both proud spirits and both will striue to a pire, when two vext Clouds iustle they strike Out fire, and you I feare me war, which peace forsend, O deere andrea pray, lets haue no wars, First let them pay the souldiers, that were mainde In the last battaile, ere more wretches fall, Or walke on stilts to timelesse Funerall. and. Respectiue deere, O my liues happines, the ioy of all my being, do not shape Frightfull conceit beyond the intent of act, I know thy loue is vigilant ore my bloud, And fears ill fate which heauen hath yet withstood, But be of comfort, sweet Horatio knowes, I go to knit friends, not to kindle foes. Hor. true Madam Belimperia, thats his taske the phraise he vseth must be gently stylde, the king hath warned him to be smooth and mild. Bel. But will you indeed andrea. and. By this. And By this lip blushing kisse. Hora. O you sweare sweetly. Bel. Ile keepe your oth for you tell you returne. Then ile be sure you shall not be forsworne. Enter Pedringano. And. Ho Pedringano. Ped. Signioro. And. Are all things abord. Ped. They are my good Lord. And. Then Bellimperia. I take leaue: Horatio Be in my absence my deare selfe, chast selfe, What playing the woman Bellimperia: Nay then you loue me not, or at the least, You drowne my honores in those flowing watters, Beleeue it Bellimperia, tis as common, To weepe at parting, as to be a woman, Loue me more valliant, play not this moyst prize, Be woman in all partes, saue in thy eies: And so I leaue thee. Bel. Farwell my Lord: Be mindfull of my loue, and of your word. And. Tis fixed vpon my hart, adew soules friend. Hora. All honor, one Andreas steps attende. Bel. Yet he is in sight, &amp; yet but now hees vanisht. Exit Andrea. Hora. Nay Lady if you stoope so much to passion, ile call him back againe. Bel. O good Horatio, no: it is for honor prethee let him go. Hora. Then Madam be composd as you weare wont, to musick and delight, the time being Commick, will Seeme short and pleasant, till his returne From Portingale: and, madam in this circle, Let your hart moue, Honord promotion is the sap of loue. Exit Omnes. Enter Lorenza and lazarotto, a discontented Courtier. lor. Come my soules spaniell, my lifes ietty substance, Whats thy name? laz. My names an honest name, a Courtiers Name: tis lazarotto. lor. What lazarotto. laz. Or rather rotting in this lazy age, that Yeelds me no imployments, I haue mischiefe Within my breast more then my bulke can hold, I want a midwife to deliuer it. lor. Ile be the hee one then, and rid thee soone Of this dull, leaden, and tormenting elfe: Thou knowst the loue betwixt Bellimperia and andreas bosome? laz. I, I do. lor. How might I crosse, it, my sweet mischiefe: Hunny damnation how? lo. Well: as many waies as there are paths to hell And thats enow ifaith: from vserers doore There goes one pathe, from friers that nurse Whores, there goes another path: from brokers Stals, from rich that die and build no hospitals, Two other paths: from farmers that crack barns, With stuffing corne, yet starue the needy swarmes, Another path: from drinking schooles one, from Dicing houses, but from the court, none, none. lor. Heere is a slaue iust a the stampe, I wish: Whose Iuck-soules, blacker then his name, Though it stand printed with a Rauens quill. But lazarotto crosse, my Sisters loue, and ile Raine showers of Duckets in thy palme. laz. Oh Duckets, dainty ducks forgiue me, Duckets, ile fetch you duck inough for gold, And thinck males, the punck wanton and the Bawd to winke. lor. Discharg, discharg, good lazaratto, how we May crose my Sisters louing hopes. laz. Nay? now ile tell you. lor. Thou knowest Addreas gone embassador. laz. The better thers opportunity now list to me. Enter Ieronimo, and Horatio, and ouer heares their talke. Alcario the duke Medinas sonne, Dotes on your Sister Bellimperia, Him in her priuate gallery you shall place, To court her, let his protestations be, Fashoned with rich Iewels, for in loue, great, Gifts and gold haue the best toong to moue, Let him not spare an oth, without a iewell, To bind it fast: Oh I know womens harts What stuffe they are made of, my Lord: Gifts and giuing, will melt the chasest Seeming female liuing. lo. Indeede andrea is but poore, though honorable, His bounty amongst souldiers sokes him dry, And therefore great gifts may bewitch her eie. Iero. Heeres no fine villainie, no damnd brother? lo. But say she should deny his gifts, be all Composd of hate, as my mind giues me, that she wooll: what then? Laz. Then thus: At his returne to spaine, Ile Murder don Andrea. Lo. Darst thou sperit. Laz. What dares not hee do, that near hopes To Inherit. Hora. Hee dares bee damnd like thee. Laz. Dare I: Ha, ha, I haue no hope of euerlasting Height, my souls a Moore you know saluations White, what dare not I enact then, tush, hee dies I will make way to Bellimperias eies. Lo. To weepe I feare but not to tender loue. Haz. Why is she not a woman, she must weepe A while as widdowes vse till their first sleepe Who in the morrow folloing will be sould to newe, Before the first are throughly cold: So Bellimperia, For this is common, the more She weepes, the More shee plaies the woman. Lo. Come then, how ere it hap Andrea shal be crost. Haz. Let mee alone, Ile turne him to a ghoast. Exit Lorenzo, and lazarotto, and Horatio. Manet Ieronimo. Iero. Farwell true brace of villaynes, Come hether boy Horatio, didst thou here them. Hora. O my true brested father, my eares haue sukt In poyson, deadly Poyson, murder Andrea: O Inhumain practis, had not your reuerend Yeares beene present heere, I should haue Ponyarded the villaynes bowels, and shoued his Soule out to Damnation, Murder Andrea: Honest lord: Impions villayns. Iero. I like thy true hart boy, thou louest thy friend, It is the greatest argument and sign that I begot thee, For it showes thou art mine. Hora. O father: Tis a charitable deed, To preuent those that would make vertue bleed. Ile dispatch letters to don andrea, Unfould their hellish Practise, damnd intent, Against the vertuous riuers of his life? Murder andrea. Enter Isabella. Iero. Peace: Who comes heere: newes newes Isaballa. Isa. What newes Ieronimo? Iero. Strang newes, Lorenzo is becom an honest man Isa. Is this your wondrous newes. Iero.

Lend your asistance, clap a siluer tongue within This pallat, that when I approach, Within the presence of this demy Goddesse, I may posses an adimanticke power, And so bewitch her with my honied speech, Haue euery sillable a musick stop, that when I pause the mellody may moue, And hem perswasion tweene her snowy paps that her hart hearing may relent and yeeld. lor.
