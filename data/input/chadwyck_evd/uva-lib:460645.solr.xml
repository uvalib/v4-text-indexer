      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. âTHE DROPPING WELL OF KNARESBOROUGH, AND ABODE OF OLD MOTHER SHIPTON, BY MOONLIGHT. Lively Music, as Curtain rises, to Ballet of Bewitched Broomsticks. Mother Shipton enters, from the abode. Mother S. Hold! cease this Terpsichorean agitation; I soon will find you better occupation. Can't you stand here for half an hour, without Each jumping up and jigging it about? Behave like broomsticks used to good society, With every besom should be some propriety. [They incline themselves reverentially. There, I am not angry; oft in stormy weather, My faithful brooms, we have swept the air together. You have borne with me, and 'twould be hard, it's true, If, just for once, I couldn't bear with you. Whose turn comes next to take a midnight ride? [A Broom advances. Well, go and get yourself rubbed down inside. [Exit Broom. As for the rest, disperse till I require you, And don't dance any more till I desire you. [Exeunt Brooms. Away, I say. Their noise and botherations Have put me out in all my calculations,â My almanac prophetic, which, you see, Tells everybody all that's going to be. Stop, let me see, JuneâJuâby the bye, What on earth ought to happen in July? [Takes out tablet. What's to come next? Now, something that surprises. Mother Bunch ascends through trap, unseen by Mother Shipton. [Writing.] About this time, we hear of sudden rises; Something comes up that will attract attention. Thereânow, what sort of weather shall I mention? Mother B. Ho, Shipton! what, in reverie immersed? You recollect my wager. Mother S. [Still Writing.] Fair at first. Mother B. About its not being paid, I'm rather nettled. I'm gettingâ Mother S. Warmer. Mother B. Mind it'sâ Mother S. Still unsettled. Mother B. Furious with rage, I scarce can keep it underâ I'm in a passionâ Mother S. Heat prevails, with thunder. Mother B. How long must I be, madam, thus detained here? [Striking stage with crutch.] You recollect our bet? Mother S. [Turning round and seeing her.] About the rain, dear? Mother B. Rain, dear, indeedâthat's very fine. A spell Forgotten made me drop in. Mother S. Drop in! Well? Mother B. Don't you remember, once upon a time, There lived a Queen who had a son? Mother S. Yes, I'm Aware of that, and on his back a hunch; And at his birth presided Mother Bunch. Mother B. I recollect, too, that there lived a King, Who had a daughterâwell, not quite the thing; So silly, that the simplest words she tripped on, And at her birth presided Mother Shipton. Mother S. Well, we bestowed the only gifts we could; The young Princess I rendered handsome. Mother B. Good. And I Prince Riquet blessed with sense and wit. Mother S. [Aside.] And never left yourself the smallest bit. Mother B. You can't have quite forgotten, that same day, A certain wager that you chose to lay? Mother S. A certain wager if I made, I win it; I couldn't recollect it just this minute. But now, as you have lost, of course I do. Mother B. Not quite so fast, the loser must be you. Prince or Princess, the ugly or the handsome, The wager ranâwhichever first should chance someâ I say, should chance some lover first to get; Decided whichâ Mother S. [Indignantly.] Witch? Mother B. Which should win the bet. Now, my Prince has found one to love him. Mother S. Sure! Mother B. She owned it, and the Prince himself before. Mother S. Before the Princeâshe won't, and so you'll find, So own it, when she sees the Prince behind. Mother B. Behold, a letter she has written since. Mother S. Proofs before letters, if you'd sell the Prince. Mother B. Well, come and satisfy yourselfâwilt go? 'Tis but a paltry hundred leagues or so. Mother S. You rush all eagerly to meet your doom, ma'am. Mother B. [Ironically.] Perhaps you can't walk? Mother S. Walk! don't I keep a broom, ma'am? Mother B. The offer is a fair one. Mother S. Well, agreed. Off for the fair one! Forth, my fiery steed. [Broomstick appears. There's room for two outside, if you don't mind Sitting a little closer up behind; Though, I predict a time there'll be no room For two of our sex upon one birch broom. I prophesy that there will comeâ Mother B. Come, go; Besides the bet, you are losing time, you know. Mother S. True, time is moneyâbut, I prophesyâ Thereâjust this onceâthat London, by and bye, Will grow so large thatâlistenâ Mother B. I attend to it. Mother S. So large, that I can seeâ Mother B. [Aside, and impatiently.] There'll be no end to it. Mother S. O'er houses will run wires called telegraphic; That underneath the streets will run the traffic; That everywhere a bridge will span the stream; That a Policeman will a wonder seem; That a great Exhibitionâ Mother B. Don't, you elf, Make a great exhibition of yourself, But come away at once. That ought to bring her to. Mrs. S. It's very hard one can't predict a thing or two. Hurried Music.âA rush of Villagers on each side. 1st V. Here's Mother Shipton! seize her, burn her, drown her! 2nd V. My wife she's made a subject for the crowner. 1st V. She's killed my cattle, though a horse shoe's nailed. 2nd V. And all my crops this summer somehow failed. Mother S. That's your return for all the good I've done. Well, from this well, I'll soon repay each one: Take this, and this, and by this rapid action, Each petty rogue's in fact a petrefaction. Music.âHurryâMother Shipton sprinkles them with water from the Dropping Well, and they become petrified, in their various attitudes of attackâVillagers are drawn off as the scene changes, and Mother Bunch and Mother Shipton are seen ascending on the same Broomstick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. âMUSHROOM MARSH, ON A MISTY MORNING. Mother Bunch and Mother Shipton descend. Mother S. Come, not bad travelling this, o'er land and water, Mother B. Three hundred milesâa minute and a quarter. Your broomstick, by our Witches' Guide-Book reckoned, Is here behind its time by half a second. Mother S. Ah! that's explained, mum, easily enough. We stopped a moment for a pinch of snuff. Mother B. Why, surely, this is not our destination? Mother S. Five minutes' walk, that's allâthe nearest station. Only the last time I came here, was sown Some imp seed, which by this time should have grown. I thought you might take advantage of me, madam, So, if I wished assistants, here I had 'em. You see, at present, everywhere among us, A mushroom, popularly called a fungus; Now I but strike my crutch, and, with this plunge, I To animation raise, for fun, the Fungi. [At her bidding, Mushrooms beeome animatedâThey express submission to Mother Shipton. Behold! I here have those who, if I need 'em, Will prove invaluable aids indeed, ma'am; They ask no higher wages than my thanks. Observe them just go through their little pranks. [Mushroom Elves go through a series of movements. Has not my Princess got a lover? 1st Mush. Such Might all young ladies wish. Mother S. I thought as much. And didn't her enchanting features do it? 1st Mush. Of course they did. Mother S. My wager's won, I knew it. Mother B. I see, by this, you think to get the victory. My power of magic, also, I must quick try. I, too, have potent fairies at my call; More graceful ones, and not absurdly small. Nay, Mother Bunch is one who knows her trade;â Appear, ye nymphs, who haunt each woodland glade. [Change of scene to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. âTHE LAKE OF THE LILIES. Music.âThe Fairies enter. 1st Fairy. Come, Mother Bunch, we here await your leisure; Why are we summoned? let me know your pleasure. Mother B. I knew, of course, your readiness to serve us, But must confess, I felt a little nervous. I wasn't sure, when I invoked you here, Exactly in what form you might appear. You have come out pretty handsomely, however. Mother S. Handsomeâand look at me! oh, did you ever? I prophesy, no face, however fair it isâ Mother B. Excuse my friend's absurd peculiarities; She has a weakness for the oratorical. Mother S. Howeverâwell, you'll find it in my oracle. Mother B. Ye nymphs, whose charms his gift of wit provided, You knew Prince Riquet quite as well as I did; Say, is there one, now he's of age and bigger, Who loves him, notwithstanding his odd figure? 1st Fairy. There is. Mother B. Her name? 1st Fairy. The Princess Amouretta. Mother S. Why, that's the very party I would bet aâ Mother B. There, I have wonâthe stakes, I claim them all. Mother S. Stakes! The mistakes, ma'am, such things you should call. That's my Princess, so beautiful, and yet So silly. Loved he first, I win my bet. Mother B. An upright wager always should be paid. Mother S. No wager's uprightâevery wager's laid. Mother B. Well, here's the umpire; tell us which began To love the first, the woman or the man? Mother S. Stop! here's the point: which was it loved the other? Did t'other this love, or did this love t'other? 1st Fairy. Cease your dispute; Prince Riquet will confess He loves the lady; and the fair Princess Will equally admit she loves the Prince, Though one she has never seen before nor since. Mother S. What! never seen him? 1st Fairy. Never; but, last week, Wandering within his woods, she heard him speak; And what he said, so soon her heart ensnared, That her affections swiftly were declared. Mother S. Why, then, it seems, if bothâno, stop! if heâ That is to say, if neitherâlet me seeâ I prophesy, that this will be a query No fellow can make out, but Lord Dundreary. 1st Fairy. Till they're affianced, I, your referee, Declare the wager can't decided be. Mother B. I'll hasten on the Prince's wedding-day. Mother S. I'll make the Princess all her charms display. Mother B. [Aside.] Poor Mother Shipton! won't she make a stir? Mother S. [Aside.] Poor Mother Bunch! I steal a march on her. 1st Fairy. When Prince and Princess fairly plight their troth, I will be near, to settle with you both. Mother B. We meet again, then; till we do, good bye! [Exit. Mother S. Adoo! adoo!âa do I mean to try. [Exit. 1st Fairy. Now let your fairy forms, ere separation, In poses form a tasteful combination; Whilst we, as fairy-books all say we do, Protect the good, and well reward the true. GRAND BALLET. [Tableau, on which the scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. âPRESENCE-CHAMBER IN THE KING'S PALACE. Enter King Rumbustical, driving the Guards, Attendants, Court Physician, and the various Members of the Court, before himâThey appeal to the King. King. Pooh! don't tell meâI'm in a rage outrageous! I am Rumbustical, surnamed Rampageous; My temper's badâthe slightest things upset it; I want my way in everything, and get it, There's not a man in all my wide dominions, About my meaning can have two opinions; Or, if he does, and daringly confesses it, He'll rue the very moment he expresses it! Groom of the Bedchamber, how was'tâtake warningâ [Groom advances, with tremulous knees. My shaving-water didn't boil, this morning? How dared you bring me lukewarmâlook this way, sirâ Water, in which to dip my royal razor? Confine the caitiff, fifty fathoms deep, In lowest dungeon, 'neath the castle keep. [MusicâGroom borne off. Where's the First Lord in Waiting? [First Lord advances, nervously. Sir, I found My toast, this morning, blacked, instead of browned; For this, until I hear of due repentance, Twelve months in banishment shall be your sentence. [MusicâFirst Lord taken off. There, having done what justice has required, I feel as tranquil as could be desired. SONG, King Rumbustical.âAir, âJohn Jones the Teetotaller.â I am a Monarch with whom it's the toss of a Shilling, if one of my guards feels the loss of a Head, when I'm any way angry because of a Knack that I've got, soon to get my remorse over. People don't come with their impudent sauce over Me, for impertinence I never gloss over. Even my daughter, I shan't feel the loss of herâ Don't I take everything like a Philosopher? [To Guards at back. What! you are at it again every one of you; I've got my eye on you, jigging away! Come, now I hope that you all see the force of a Capital argument, which would dispose of a Difficult matter, when you come across of a Thing that a mortal might fairly get cross over. I've got a child, and I went to dispose of her, So I've proclaimed that, if any one knows of a Husband, who'll take her, and not think the worse of her, He'll be a man I shall call a Philosopher. What! you are at it again every one of you; Tiddy fol liddyâyou'll catch it, some day. Where is my daughter? Don't you see I'm calm? WhereâI repeat, you needn't feel alarmâ [Raising voice. Where is my daughter? why do you not reply? Go off, or else your heads do, instantly. Enter a grotesque Maid of Honour. Oh! here is one, who, from her situation, Ought to impart a little information. Where is the Princess Amouretta? Pray, to her State, that her father has a word to say to her. [Exit Maid of Honour. How quickly was that stern command obeyed, And yet how mildly did it seem conveyed. Her name will save each person I am rash on; My little pet absorbs my greater passion. [MusicâCrash of glass without. Enter Amouretta, with a Maid of Honour. Amou. There goes the glassâthat either I or you did. I'm always breaking something. King. [AdvancingâCourtiers retire at bach.] Hearts included. Now, don't you think that it's a pity, rather, My handsome childâhow very like your fatherâ You should beâwell, I'll mildly sayâa dunce? Amou. As well, papa, have said a fool, at once. You know I'm so like you! King. In faceâfor t'other, I trace a great resemblance to your mother. Amou. That I am stupid, silly, I admit, Unintellectual above a bit; All this I own, yet hope that, by and bye, I shall improve a little. King. So do I. You drive away all suitors from the spot; It's really time some husband that you got. Can't you contrive to look a little wise? Just shut your mouth, and open wide your eyes, And something nice I think that I could send you. Amou. What's that, papa? King. A husband, who'd attend you Where'er you go, yet never in the way; Who all the bills that you run up, would pay; Who would, with title, give you wealth and lands. [Aside.] And take a deal of trouble off my hands. Amou. What! let me have a nice new doll to play with, Whose arms I might pull off and make away with! Let me have sweetstuff, and not see me worried, Because I can't spell cat or dog when hurried! Nor bother me about the parts of speech, Nor that twice two makes five would want to teach! King. That which you wish to do, will please your lover, That which you can't do, leave him to discover. Three more arrive, to seek your hand, to-day, Even now, your suitors must be on the way. Amongst the three, you'll have to make your choice. Amou. Please, pa, I think I've made itâit's a voice. King. A voice! whoever heard of such a thing? A voice! whence came it? did it speak or sing? Amou. North, east, west, south, whence from? it puzzles me. King. A voice that had no compass I can see. An echo, nothing moreâif that we chase, We start upon a neck o' nothing race. How can mere sounds a woman's heart obtain? Sounds, zounds! I am getting in a rage again. Enter Herald, with Trumpet. Herald. Sire, I'm desiredâ King. You are, to quickly tell. Herald. Three princely suitors have arrived. King. 'Tis well! Admit them to our regal pleasure. Stay! What ho! b'low thereâtrumpets, blow away. [Exit Heraldâvehement Flourish. That ought to tell those waiting for admission, Our country's in a flourishing condition. [To Amouretta.] Leave all the talking to your royal papaâ No word which shows the silly belle you are. Music.âHerald and Guards usher in Prince Mannikin, a German Prince, short and stout, with Attendants, bearing presentsâChange of Music to Oriental style, and enter Prince Gogmagog, a Tartar, very tall, with his suite, bearing presentsâThey range themselves on each side of the stage, King Rumbustical in the centre, having the Princess on his rightâAttendants bring throne. Mannikin. From distant lands I come, oh King, to press My suit, as suitor to the fair Princess. The picture of her beauty, I must say, Falls short of that which I behold to-day; And, as the fair original does exceed All that the painter painted her indeed, So, just as much, my words will fail to show How much more love I feel than she can know. Gogmagog. I also have beheld the lady's picture, And in my heart have framed it as a fixture; But, in few words, I sayâ'tis all I canâ If she requires a husband, I'm the man. King. Princes, you're welcome; my impartial eyes Discern no difference 'twixt you, save in size. But, tall and short, this problem here unriddling, You don't inquire, but, thank you, I'm but middling. I am anxious that my daughter should be married, Ere, by some revolution, off I'm carried. I have heard sometimes such things the people do, Forswearing royalty in an Otho too; And ere this crisis comes, I wish my daughter To wed. [Aside, to Amouretta.] Now, then, the tall one or the shorter. Amou. Didn't you say a third was coming, pa? King. Dear me! I'd quite forgotâOh, here we are. Expressive Music.âPrince Riquet is borne in by four Pages, in a Palanquin litter, the Curtains of which conceal him. I wish my speech I'd kept until this minute, Although there wasn't any great deal in it. A royal speech is like that Palanquin, What it conveys not easily is seen. May I inquire, through curtains that have hid you all, Your title, most illustrious individual? Our royal courtesy should not be rebuffed! Your name isâ [Riquet shows his faceâChordâGeneral expression of horror. Amou. Ha! Riquet. [Emerging from Palanquin.] Prince Riquet with the Tuft. [Pantomime MusicâPalanquin taken offâRiquet pays his respects to the PrincessâAfter going round the stage, she shrinks from him. King. Well, I can't say, with truth to keep adherence, A person prepossessing in appearance. Amou. The ugliest mortal that I ever saw. Riquet. I am here, King, to become your son-in-law. King. You may be come; but, up your merits summing, We rather would have seen you more becoming. Riquet. I have brought few gifts, in wealth though not deficient. King. No doubt your presence will be quite sufficient. Riquet. [Giving a small Mirror.] This faithful glass should win her young affection; What thort of gift could equal her reflection? [Presenting fancy Box.] A box of curious perfumeâ King. [Aside.] He presents That, as he knows the girl has got no scents. Riquet. Made from the parchment of a Chancery suit; It lasts for everâhence its high repute. Lastly, a flower permit me to deliverâ [Giving a Rose. No value, saye what's set upon the giver. Amou. A fright, I must say, yet of manners good. Riquet. [In soft tone.] Fair Princess! Amou. Ha! the voice heard in the wood! [They come down. Riquet. The same; nor shall its accents now offend, Breathing softâ Amou. Nonsense that I comprehend. The owner of that voice I vowed to wed; That he could make me sensible, he said. Riquet. He said it, and can do it! but decide, To beâere this can beâhis be-auteous bride. Amou. That time will soon expire. Riquet. And so shall I, If to this question, âYesâ you don't reply. King. [Advancing.] Your choice? this great affair at once to wind up. Amou. [Crossing to King.] To-morrow, pa, I'll make my little mind up. In the meantime, I'll go and have a skip. [Goingâreturns. Isn't it nice to have a pretty whip, That's got a whistle at the end? You know, When I want any of you, that I'll blow. [Exit Amouretta. King. Nay, Princes, that is but her witty prattle. Re-enter Amouretta. Amou. Oh! I say, didn't some one bring a rattle? That's what I likeâa swing, that's precious fun, too. King. Once her tongue starts, no knowing where 'twill run to. Sweet child, good bye! leave all to your papa. [Aside.] Whipped, Miss, and sent to bed you shall be. Go! Amou. Ta! ta! [Exit Amouretta. King. Her spirits carry her awayâdon't doubt it; Farewell! to-morrow we'll say more about it. [Music.âPrinces take their departureâExeunt all but King and Riquet. King. You seem to be in thought, Prince, that you tarry. Riquet. Men should be thoughtful when about to marry. My figure may have shocked her; few can bear The sight of this great tuft of reddish hair; A form misshapen; back, if she's particular, Slightly diverging from the perpendicular; Legs parenthetical she might excuse; But here's a lock that few would pick and choose. Yet on her love my only chance depended, Of this old structure being repaired and mended. DUET, Prince Riquet and King.âAir, âCheer up, Sam.â Music published by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, in No. 904, of the Musical Treasury, price 3d.] King. The matter with him I don't know, He's troubled in his mind; He has a load of care, and so, P'raps carries it behind. In looking at his face, so Much ugliness I track; But it wouldn't do to say so, Of course, behind his back. Riguet. I really think that I've now A hopeless chase begun, For wooing here is rather queer, For such an ugly one: Oh! sad's my case, no grace, bad face, In vain to break the spell; I'm trying hard, but I'm not the card To gallivant that gal. [Dancing Duet, with KingâExeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. âTHE ENCHANTED WOOD. Enter Amouretta, wearing the Rose, and skipping as she enters. Amou. Here let me take five minutes for reflection. To ugly men I have a great objection, But that same voice which told me, if I loved The owner, I should find myself improved, I must confess, has made a deep impression; My mind's already made a vast progression. SONG, Princess Amouretta, Air, âPeter Gray.â [This Popular Melody is the exclusive Copyright Property of the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, and can only be had in their Works.â Peter Gray, Song, 6d.âPeter Gray Polka, 6d.âPeter Gray March, 6d.âPeter Gray for Brass Band, 9d.] The Prince is not a nice young man to look at, I must say, Or to win the heart of any young gal who came within his way, Who came within his way, Becauseâa-lack-a-day! His hump on back with any young gal would make her run away. Hump-back sweetheart! Hump-back sweetheart, say, If you're the sort of ladâheigh-ho! With whom to run away. They want me to be married, but I really must say no, If somebody more handsome here they don't begin to show, They don't begin to showâ He ugly is, I know; But what's a nice young gal to do, who hasn't got a beau? So, hump-back sweetheart! Hump-back sweetheart, say, If you're the sort of ladâheigh ho! With whom to run away. Why this must be the period, as I guess, I should replyâsupposing I say âyes.â Enter Little Cook. What sound was that which thus my temper ruffles? Cook. It's only me, I'm looking for some truffles; We have a turkey with them should be stuffed. Amou. For whom? Cook. For whom!âPrince Riquet with the Tuft. To-morrow home his bride he will be bearing, And we his wedding-breakfast are preparing. Amou. Good gracious! then I dare say I'm his bride, And didn't know it. Did I quite decide? Cook. Wouldn't you like to see the preparations? Amou. I should. Cook. Then I'll just make some conjurations. Hey! presto! quick!âhold fast to yonder tree! Down to the kitchen, now at once go we. [Expressive MusicâChange of scene to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. âMAGIC KITCHEN OF PRINCE RIQUET. All the Little Cooks discovered, busily engagedâMusicâPiano, when speaking. Amou. Ah! marvellous scene, what wondrous animation! How well each scullion seems to know his station; Frying and boiling, baking, stewing, roasting, Twisting and turning, tossing up and toasting. And who's the bride? this banquet that you set her. Cook. What don't you know? the Princess Amouretta. Amou. That's me! I'm in a dreamâI am the bride you Cater for. The bridegroomâ Prince Riquet enters. Riquet. Stands beside you. [TableauâScene closes in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. âPLEASURE GARDENS OF THE KING'S PALACE. Enter Prince Mannikin, and Prince Gogmagog, with their Attendants, carpet-bags, &amp;c., as if taking their departure. Mannikin. Was ever prince so infamously treated? Did I come all this distance to be cheated? Am I to be refused, renounced, rejected, Because I'm short? Gogmagog. It's what I long expected. But I'm refusedâit's that surprises me. Mannikin. I'm not at all astonished that should be; But sixteen chances still I've on my list, Amongst them all, a bride cannot be missed. As for Prince Riquet he is no great catch for her. Away! Gogmagog. A way I'll find to be a match for her. Pack up, pack offânor for a warning tarry. Mannikin. To persons who were here about to marry. We to this close will bring our own disputes. Gogmagog. By leavingâ Mannikin. Nothing, but our left-off suits. DUET, Princes Mannikin and Gogmagog.âAir, âDarkies' Christmas Day.â [This Popular Melody, and all Mackney's best Songs, are the exclusive Copyright Property of the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, and can only be had in their Works.âDarkies' Christams Day, composed and sung by E. W. Mackney, 3d., for Brass Band, 9d. Come, off with the train and away let us go, Put needless excuses away, Take up a Princess awaiting a beau, We've made a miss to-day. This isn't the way us to treat, But we'll be revenged some day; So we'll skedaddle and make good our retreats, 'Cause we've made a miss to day. Then, Prince, you come away, It will not do to stayâ Attendants all, both great and small, Skedaddle slick away! [Exeunt, with Attendants. Enter Amouretta. Amou. Well, how I know not, but I'm here at last, Underground Railways have a train that's fast. Since first I heard that voice whose source was hid, I don't feel half so stupid as I did. It's true that, when I heard it sing that song, too, I didn't know the body it belonged to. He's very ugly, and he's rather small, But nature can't be bountiful to all. And when he speaks, his hunch appears so slight, To sneer would be unch-aritable quite. Prince Riquet appears, at back. Riquet. On hope's light wing I soar triumphant yet, Her good hope pinion if I only get. She wears the rose I gave her, certain sign Its stalk reminds her, now and then, of mine. [Advancing. Fair Princessâha! you start! am I so frightful? Amou. Well, if I said so, you might think me spiteful; But, to be plainâ Riquet. That you can never be. None can complain, who here come plain, but me. Amou. Well, to be candid, I could wish a movement Got up by somebody for your improvement. Your back might levelled be, and, I surmise, Your nose destroys the prospect of your eyes; Whilst those bad limbs may insurrection smother, When each leg here turns straighter to the other. Riquet. You've breathed the perfume of that magic flower To frame a repartee it gives the power. I'm glad to find you've kept my gift, and used it. Amou. If you're the gift, I fear I have much abused it. Riquet. And does my voice your former fear renew? Amou. Not since our meeting gave a hint of you. Riquet. And from that interview you are ready still, What then you promised, fairly to fulfil. Amou. I am. Riquet. The crisis of my fate approaches. But don't you dread sneers, taunts, remarks, reproaches? Being the bride of such an ugly man, Fit for the monster of some caravan, Who might be poked up to display his phizâ âWalk up! walk up! the ugliest chap what is! Observe his walkâthere arn't a man to match him! Out in the woods we had to go and catch him! Alive, alive oh! thr-r-r-ippenceâchildren less!â Is this a husband for a fair Princess? SONG, Prince Riquet. Riquet is my nameâawful monster 'tis I am, Always was the sameâstill for you I busy am. Legs that curveâif you reckon all my merits upâ It's more than I deserve, but you see I keep my spirits up. Nose not niceâeverybody's shrinking from it, Head quite twice the size to get your thinking from it. Yes, I'm a fright! Take me in a caravan; I'm not quite made like âany other man.â Heads turn away, seeing such a phiz awry, Day after day, my life is quite a misery. This tuft, I know, you may think a slight objection, Its tints bestow no harm on my complexion. Look at my hump, own that not amiss it is; All in a lump, you have my eccentricities. Yes I'm a fright! fit only for a caravan; Ain't I right? Not like âany other man.â At my manners rough, meet me with my swoop by side; âQuantumn sufââgets the man who dares deride; A soldier, too, I am by trade, at foe I never flinches, Miss; I always prove a cutting blade, no matter what his inches is, Yet to you, if you'll but return my love, I'll prove true, and gentle as a sucking dove, Though I'm a fright, love you dearly yet I can; Ain't I right? Yes! âOr any other man.â [Dance. Amou. You make me shudder. Yet to you I owe The vast improvement in my mind, I know; So, as acknowledgement, Prince Riquet, there! My handâmy heartâyour burthen I will share! Riquet. And you are mine! then all I wish is granted, You have the power to make me all you wanted; To you I give the chance of growing wiser, Let me appear more comelyâ Amou. In my eyes, sir, You have already to improve begun. Riquet, I love you! Riquet. Then behold, it's done! [Riquet, with change of dress, becomes deprived of all his deformities. Amou. A miracle! Riquet. But one that love has wrought. Amou. To love I owe, then, all that I've been taught. Enter King Rumbustical. King. What wonder's this, my daughter turned out clever! This is surprising, really! Well, I never! Riquet. You here behold her ready to recite Act, lecture, sing, play, dance, on any night; Edit a daily paperânay, worse task, Answer all questions correspondents ask; Write novels, translate German, construe Homer, Or get a first-class medical diploma; Conduct a magazine, or bravely try To colonize New Zealand, like Miss Rye; Problems in science, doesn't care a bit for. In fact, there's nothing that she isn't fit for King. Then nothing more can clearly now remainâ Though I should like to get enraged againâ Than to repeat the good old five-act line, Bless you, my children, and may joy be thine! Enter, on opposite sides, Mother Bunch and Mother Shipton. Mother B. Stop! there's our wager. Well, my bet is won. Mother S. Stay! If there is a winner, I'm the one. Through me the Princess got a husband, clearly. Mother B. Through me the Prince obtained the Princess, merely. Enter Fairy. Fairy. It's a drawn bet, and so, to do it cleverly, Suppose the wager's drawn, and drawn by Beverley. Whate'er he touches, he with taste expresses; And this will suit the Prince and the Princess's.
