Not with that Negligent rudeness: But I kiss your hands Signior Don Incubo de Hambre, and then My titles; Master Bayly of Castil-blanco: Thou nere wilt have the elegancy of an Host; I sorrow for thee, as my friend and gossip: No smoak, nor steam out-breathing from the kitchen? There's litle life i'th harth then. Die. I, there, there, That is his friendship, hearkning for the spit, And sorrow that he cannot smel the pot boil. Inc. Strange An Inne should be so curst, and not the sign Blasted, nor withered; very strange, three days now, And not an egg eat in it, or an onyon. Die. I think they ha' strew'd the high-wayes with caltraps, I, No horse dares pass 'em; I did never know A week of so sad doings, since I first Stood to my sign-post. Inc.

Die. How? Inc. A Master of Ceremonies: At least vice-master, and to do nought in cuerpo, That was his maxime; I wil tell thee of him: He would not speak with an Ambassadors Cook, See a cold bake-meat from a forreign part In cuerpo: had a dog but staid without, Or beast of quality, as an English cow, But to present it self, he would put on His Savoy chain about his neck, the ruff And cuffs of Holland, then the Naples hat With the Rome hat-band, and the Florentine agat, The Millain Sword, the Cloak of Genua, set With Flemish buttons, all his given peeces To entertain 'em in, and complement Knock within.

Dieg. And with your temperance-favour, yet I think Your worship would put to't at six and thirty For a good wager; and the meal in too. Inc. I do not know what mine old mouth can do, I ha not prov'd it lately Dieg. That's the grief Sir. Inc. But is he without hope then gone to bed? Host. I fear so Sir, has lock'd the door close to him Sure he is very ill. Inc. That is with fasting, You should ha told him Gossip, what you had had, Given him the inventury of your kitchen, It is the picklock in an Inne, and often Opens a close barr'd stomach: what may he be, troh?

J dislike Nothing mine Host, but that I may not see Your conceal'd guest: here's to you. Die. In good faith Sir, I wish you as wel as him: would you might see him. Inc. And wherefore may he not: Die. 'Has lock'd himself Sir Up, and has hir'd both the beds o' my wife At extraordinarie rate. Phil. Ile give as much If that will do't, for one, as he for both; What say you mine Host, the door once open Ile fling my self upon the next bed to him And there's an end of me till morning; noise I will make none. Die. I wish your worship wellâbut Inc. His honour is engag'd: And my she Gossip Hath past her promise, hath she not? Die. Yes truely: Inc.

Maries. Ex. al but Diego. Die. Lazaro Enter Lazaro. How do the horses? Laz. Would you would go and see Sir, Aâof all Jades, what a clap h'as given me: As sure as you live master he knew perfectly I couzend him on's Oats: he lookt upon me And then he sneerd, as who should say take heed sirrah: And when he saw our half peck, which you know Was but an old Court dish: lord how he stampt: I thought 't had been for joy, when suddenly He cuts me a back caper with his heels And takes me just o'th' crupper: down came I And all my ounce of Oates: Then he neigh'd out As though he had had a Mare by'th taile. Die. Faith Lazaro We are to blame to use the poor dumb serviters So cruelly. Laz. Yonder's this other gentlemans horse Keeping our Lady eve: the devill a bit Has got since he came in yet: there he stands And looks, and looks, but 'tis your pleasure sir He shall look lean enough: has hay before him But 'tis as big as hemp, and will as soon choak him, Unless he eate it butter'd: he had four shoos And good ones when he came: 'tis a strange wonder With standing still he should cast three. Die. O Lazaro The devils in this trade: truth never knew it And to the devill we shall travell Lazaro Unless we mend our manners: once every week I meet with such a knock to molefie me Sometimes a dozen to awake my conscience Yet still I sleep securely. Laz. Certain Master We must use better dealing. Die. Faith for mine own part Not to give ill example to our issues, I could be well content to steal but two girths, And now and then a saddle cloth: change a bridle Onely for exercise. Laz. If we could stay there There were some hope on's Master: but the devill is We are drunk so early we mistake whole Saddles Sometimes a horse; and then it seems to us too Every poore Jade has his whole peck, and tumbles Up to his ears in clean straw, and every bottle Shews at the least a dozen; when the truth is Sir Ther's no such matter, not a smell of provinder, Not so much straw, as would tye up a horse tail, Nor any thing ith' rack, but two old cobwebs And so much rotten hay as had been a hens nest. Die. Well, these mistakings must be mended Lazaro, These apparitions, that abuse our sences, And make us ever apt to sweep the manger But put in nothing; these fancies must be forgot And we must pray it may be reveal'd to us Whose horse we ought in conscience to couzen, And how, and when: A Parsons horse may suffer A little greazing in his teeth, 'tis wholsome; And keeps him in a sober shuffle: and his Saddle May want a stirrop, and it may be sworn His learning lay on one side, and so brok it: Has ever Oates in's cloak-bag to prevent us And therefore 'tis a meritorious office To tythe him soundly. Laz. And a Grazier may For those are pinching puckfoysts, and suspitious: Suffer a myst before his eyes sometimes too, And think hee sees his horse eat half a bushel: When the truth is, rubbing his gums with salt, Till all the skin come off: he shal but mumble Like an old woman, that were chewing brawn, And drop 'em out again. Die. That may do wel too, And no doubt 'tis but venial: But good Lazaro Have you a care of understanding horses, Horses with angry heels, gentlemens horses, Horses that know the world: let them have meat Till their teeth ake; and rubbing till their ribbs Shine like a wenches forehead; they are devils Laz. And look into our dealings: as sure as we live These Courtiers horses are a kind of Welsh prophets, Nothing can be hid from 'em: For mine own part The next I cozen of that kind, shal be founderd, And of all four too: Ile no more such complements Upon my crupper. Die. Steal but a litle longer Till I am lam'd too, and wee'l repent together, It wil not be above two daies. Laz. By that time I shal be wel again, and all forgot Sir. Dieg. Why then ile stay for thee. Exit. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Theodosia. and Phillipo on several Beds. Theo. Oh,âhoâ? ohâho? Phil. Ha? Theo. Ohâoh? heartâheartâheartâheart? Phil. What's that? Theo. When wilt thou break?âbreak, break, break? Phil. Ha? I would the voice were strong, or I neerer, Theo. Shame, shame, eternal shame? what have I done? Phil. Done? Theo. And to no end: what a wild Jorney Have I more wildly undertaken? Phil. Jorney? Theo. How without counsel? care? reason? or fear? Phil. Whither wil this fit carry? Theo. O my folly: Phil. This is no common sickness. Theo. How have I left All I should love, or keep? Ã´ heaven. Phil. Sir. Theo. Ha? Phil. How do you gentle Sir? Theo. Alas my fortune Ph. It seems your sorrow oppresses: please your goodness Let me bear half Sir: a divided burthen Is so made lighter. Theo. Oh, Phil. That sigh betrayes The fulness of your grief: Theo. I, if that grief Had not bereft me of my understanding, I should have wel remembred where I was, And in what company; and clapt a lock Upon this tongue for talking. Phil. Worthy Sir Let it not add to your grief, that I have heard A sigh, or groan come from you: That is all Sir: The. Good Sir no more: you have heard too much I fear, Would I had taken poppy when I spake it. Phil. It seems you have an ill belief of me And would have feard much more, had you spoke ought I could interpret. But beleeve it Sir Had I had means to look into your breast, And tane you sleeping here, that so securely I might have read, all that your woe would hide I would not have betrayd you. Theo. Sir that speech Is very noble, and almost would tempt My need to trust you. Phil. At your own election, I dare not make my faith so much suspected As to protest again: nor am I curious To know more then is fit. Theo. Sir I wil trust you But you shal promise Sir to keep your bed, And whatsoe'er you hear, not to importune More I beseech you from me. Phil. Sir I wil not. Theo. Then I am proan to utter. Phil. My faith for it. Theo. If I were wise, I yet should hold my peace You wil be noble. Phil. You shal make me so If you'l but think me such. Theo. I do: then know You are deceiv'd with whom you have talk so long. I am a most unfortunate lost woman. Phil. Ha? Theo. Do not stir Sir: I have here a Sword. Phil. Not I sweet Lady: of what blood, or name. Theo. You'l keep your faith. Phil. Ile perish else. Theo. Beleeve then Of birth too noble for me, so descendedâ I am ashamd, no less then I am affrighted. Phil. Fear not: by all good things, I will not wrong you. Theo. I am the daughter of a noble Gentleman Born in this part of Spain: my fathers name Sir: But why should I abuse that reverence When a childs duty has forsaken me. Phil. All may be mended: in fit time too: speak it Theo. Alphonso, sir. Phil. Alphonso? what's your own name? Theo. Any base thing you can invent. Phil. Deal truely. Theo. They call me Theodosia Phi. Ha? and love Is that that hath chang'd you thus? Theo. Ye have observ'd me Too neerly Sir, 'tis that indeed: 'tis love Sir: And love of him (oh heavens) why should men deal thus? Why should they use their arts to cozen us? That have no cunning, but our fears about us? And ever that too late to; no dissembling Or double way but doating: too much loving? Why should they find new oaths, to make more wretches? Phil. What may his name be? Theo. Sir a name that promises Me thinks no such ill usage: Mark-antonio A noble neighbours Son: Now I must desire ye To stay a while: else my weak eyes must answer. Phil. I will:âAre ye yet ready? what is his quality? Theo. His best a theef Sir: that he would be known by; Is, heir to Leonardo, a rich Gentleman: Next, of a handsome body, had heaven made him A minde fit to it. To this man, my fortune, (My more then purblind fortune) grave my faith, Drawn to it by as many shews of service And signs of truth, as ever false tongue utter'd: Heaven pardon all. Phil. 'Tis wel said: forward Lady. Theo. Contracted Sir, and by exchange of rings Our souls deliver'd: nothing left unfinish'd But the last work, enjoying me, and Ceremony. For that I must confess was the first wise doubt I ever made: yet after all this love sir, All this profession of his faith; when dayly And hourly I expected the blest priest Hee left me like a dream, as all this story Had never been, nor thought of, why I know not; Yet I have called my conscience to confession, And every sillable that might offend I have had in shrift: yet neither loves law Signiour, Nor try of maidens duty, but desiring Have I transgrest in: left his father too, Nor whither he is gone, or why departed Can any tongue resolve mee: All my hope (Which keeps mee yet alive, and would perswade mee I may be once more happy, and thus shapes mee A shame to all my modest sex) is this Sir, I have a Brother and his old Companion, Studient in Sallimanca, there my last hope If hee bee yet alive, and can be loving Is left mee to recover him: For which travel In this Sute left at home of that dear Brothers Thus as you find mee, without fear, or wisdom, I have wander'd from my father, fled my friends, And now am only child of hope and danger: You are now silent Sir: this tedious story (That ever keeps mee waking) makes you heavy: 'Tis fit it should do so: for that, and I Can be but troubles. Phil. No, I sleep not Lady: I would I could: oh heaven is this my comfort. Theo. What aile you gentle Sir? Phil. Oh. Theo. Why do you groan so? Phil. I must, I must; oh misery. Theo. But now Sir You were my comfort: if any thing afflict yee Am not I fit to bear a part on't? and by your own rule. Phil. No; if you could heal, as you have wounded me, But 'tis not in your power. Theo. I fear intemperance. Phil. Nay do not seek to shun mee: I must see you: By heaven I must: hoa, there mine Host: a Candle: Strive not, I wil not stir ye. Theo. Noble Sir This is a breach of promise. Phil. Tender Lady It shal be none but necessary: hoa, there, Some light, some light for heavens sake. Theo. Wil ye betray mee? Are ye a gentleman? Phil. Good woman: Theo. Sir. Enter Diego with a light. Phil. If I be prejudicial to you, curse mee. Dieg. Ye are early stirring sir. Phil. Give mee your Candle And so good morrow for a while. Dieg. Good morrow Sir. Exit. Theo. My Brother Don Philippo; nay Sir, kil mee I ask no mercy Sir, for none dare know me, I can deserve none: As ye look upon me Behold in infinite these foul dishonors My noble Father, then your self: last all That bear the name of kindred, suffer in mee: I have forgot whose child I am, whose Sister: Do you forget the pity tyed to that: Let not compassion sway you: you wil be then As foul as I, and bear the same brond with me, A favourer of my fault: ye have a sword sir, And such a cause to kil me in. Phil. Rise Sister: I wear no sword for women: nor no anger While your fair chastity is yet untouch'd. Theo. By those bright starrs, it is Sir. Phil. For my Sister I do beleeve ye: and so neer blood has made us With the dear love I ever bore your vertues That I wil be a Brother to your griefs too: Be comforted, 'tis no dishonor Sister To love, nor to love him you do: he is a gentleman Of as sweet hopes, as years, as many promises, As there be growing truths, and great ones. Theo. O sir! Phil. Do not despair. Theo. Can ye forgive? Phil. Yes Sister, Though this be no smal error, a far greater. Theo. And think me stil your Sister? Phil. My dear Sister. Theo. And wil you counsel mee? Phil. To your own peace too: Ye shal love stil. Theo. How good ye are? Phil. My business, And duty to my father, which now drew mee From Salimanca, I wil lay aside And only be your Agent to perswade ye To leave both love, and him, and wel retyre ye. Theo. Oh gentle Brother. Phil. I perceive 'tis folly: Delayes in love, more dangerous. Theo. Noble Brother. Phil. Fear not, ile run your own way: and to help you, Love having rackt your passions beyond counsel: Ile hazard mine own fame: whither shal we venture? Theo. Alas, I know not Sir. Phil. Come, 'tis bright morning Let's walk out, and consider: you'l keep this habit. Theo. I would sir. Phil. Then it shal be: what must I cal ye? Come, do not blush: pray speak, I may spoil all else. Theo. Pray cal me Theodoro. Enter Diego. Dieg. Are ye ready? The day draws on a pace: once more good morrow. Theo. Good morrow gentle Host: now I must thank ye: Phil. Who do'st thou think this is? Die. Were you a wench Sir I think you would know before me. Phi. Mine own Brother. Diego. By'th Masse your noses are a kin: should I then Have been so barbarous to have parted Brothers? Phi. You knew it then. Diego. I knew 'twas necessary You should be both together: Instinct Signior Is a great matter in an Host. Theo. I am satisfied. Enter Pedro. Ped. Is not mine Host up yet? Phil. Who's that? Die. Ile see. Phil. Sister, withdraw your self. Pedr. Signiour Philippo Phil. Noble Don Pedro, where have you been this way? Pedr. I came from Port St Maries, whence the Gallyes Put this last tide, and bound for Barcellona, I brought Mark-antonie upon his way. Phil. Marc-antonie? Pedr. Who is turn'd Soldier And entertain'd in the new Regiment, For Naples. Phil. Is it possible? Pedr. I assure you. Phil. And pot they in at Barcellona? Pedr. So One of the Masters told me. Phil. Which way go you Sir? Pedr. Home: Phil. And I for Civill: pray you Sir, say not That you saw me, if you shall meet the question, I have some little businesse Pedr. Were it lesse Sir. It shall not become me, to loose the caution: Shall we break-fast together? Phil. Ile come to you Sir: Sister you hear this: I beleeve your fortune Begins to be propitious to you: we will hire Mules of mine host here: if we can himself To be our guid, and streight to Barcellona, This was as happy news, as unexpected Stay you, till I rid him away. Theo. I will. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. II Scaena I. Enter Alphonso and a Servant. Alph. Knock at the door. Ser. 'Tis open Sir. Alph. That's all one Knock when I bid you. Ser. Will not your worship enter. Alph. Will not you learn more manners Sir, and do that Your Master bids ye; knock ye knave, or ile knock Such a round peal about your pate: I enter Under his roofe, or come to say god save ye To him, the Son of whose base dealings has undone me. Knock lowder, lowder yet: ile starve, and rot first, This open ayr is every mans. 2. Ser. within. Come in Sir. Enter two Servants, Rowl: Ashton. Alph. No, no Sir, I am none of these come in Sirs None of those visitants: bid your wise Master Come out, I have to talk unto him: go Sir 2. Ser. Your worship may be welcome. Alph. Sir, I will not, I come not to be welcome: good my three duckets My pickell'd sprat a day, and no oyl to't, And once a year a cotten coat, leave prating And tell your Master, I am here. 2. Ser. I will Sir. This is a strange old man. Exit. Alph. I welcome to him! Ile be first welcome to a Pesthouse; Sirhah Lets have your valour now casde up, and quiet When an occasion calls, 'tis wisdom in ye, A Servingmans discretion: if you do draw Enter Leonardo, and Don Zanchio (carried by two Servants in a chair.) Draw but according to your entertainment; Five nobles worth of fury. Leo. Signiour Alphonso. I hope no discontent from my will given, Has made ye shun my house: I ever lov'd ye. An credit me amongst my fears 'tis greatest To minister offences. Alph. O good Signiour I know ye for Italian breed, fair tongu'd, Spare your Appologies, I care not for'em, As little for your love Sir; I can live Without your knowledge; eat mine own, and sleep Without dependances, or hopes upon ye. I come to aske my daughter. Leo. Gentle Sir. Alph. I am not gentle Sir, nor gentle will be Till I have justice, my poor child restor'd Your caper-cutting boy has run away with Yong Signior-smooth-face, he that takes up wenches With smiles, and sweet behaviours, songs, and sonnets, Your high fed Jennet, that no hedge can hold They say you bred him for a Stallion. Zanch. Fie Signiour, there be times, and terms of honour To argue these things in, descidements able To speak ye noble gentlemen, ways punctuall And to the life of credit, ye are too rugged. Alph. I am too tame Sir. Leo. Will ye hear but reason? Alph. No, I will hear no reason: I come not hither To be popt off with reason; reason then. Zanch. Why Signior, in all things there must be method Ye choak the child of honour els, discretion, Do you conceive an injury? Alph. What then Sir? Zanch. Then follow it in fair terms, let your sword bite When time calls, not your tongue. Alph. I know Sir Both when and what to do without directions, And where, and how, I come not to be tutur'd, My cause is no mans but mine own: you Signior Will ye restore my daughter? Leo. Who detains her? Alph. No more of these sleight shifts Leo. Ye urge me Signior With strange unjustice: because my Son has err'd Zanch. Mark him. Leo. Out of the heat of youth: do'st follow I must be father of his crimes. Alph. I say still Leave off your rhetorick, and restore my daughter. And sodainly: bring in your rebell too, Mountdragon, he that mounts without commission That I may see him punished, and severely, Or by that holy heaven, ile fire your house, And ther's my way of honour. Zanch. Pray give me leave Was not man made the noblest creature Alph. Well Sir. Zanch. Should not his mind then answer to his making, And to his mind his actions, if this ought to be, Why do we run a blind way from our worths, And cancell our discretions, doing those things To cure offences, are the most offences? We have rules of justice in us; to those rules Let us apply our angers: you can consider The want in others of these terminations, And how unfurnish'd they appear. Alph. Hang others, And where the wrongs are open, hang respects, I come not to consider. Leo. Noble Sir, Let us argue cooly, and consider like men. Alph. Like men! Leo. Ye are too sodain still. Alph. Like men Sir? Zanch. It is fair language, and ally'd to honour. Alph. Why, what strange beast would your grave reverence Make me appear? like men! Zanch. Taste but that point Sir, And ye recover all. Alph. I tell thy wisdome I am as much a man, and as good a man. Leo. All this is granted Sir. Alph. As wise a man. Zanch. Ye are not tainted that way. Alph. And a man Dares make thee no man; or at best, a base man. Zanch. Fy, Fy, here wants much carriage. Alph. Hang much carriage. Leo. Give me good language sirrah Signiour. Alph. Give me my daughter. Leo. I am as gentle as your self, as free born. Zanch. Observe his way. Leo. As much respect ow'd to me. Zanch. This hangs together nobly. Leo. And for Civill A great deal more it seems: go look your daughter. Zanch. There ye went well off Signiour. Leo. That rough tongue You understand at first: you never think Sir Out of your mightinesse, of my losse: here I stand A patient anvill, to your burning angers Made subject to your dangers; yet my losse equall: Who shall bring home my son? Alph. A whipping Beadle. Leo. Why, is your daughter whorish? Alph. Ha, thou dar'st not, By heaven I know thou dar'st not. Leo. I dare more Sir If you dare be uncivill. Alph. Laugh too, Pidgeon. Zanch. A fitter time for fames sake: two weak Nurses Would laugh at this; are there no more days coming, No ground but this to argue on? no swords left Nor friends to carry this, but your own furies? Alas! it shows too weakly. Alph. Let it show; I come not here for shews: laugh at me sirrah? Ile give ye cause to laugh. Leo. Ye are as like Sir As any man in Spaine. Alph. By heaven I will, I will brave Leonardo. Leo. Brave Alphonso, I will expect it then. Zanch. Hold ye there both, These terms are noble. Alph. Ye shall hear shortly from me. Leo. Now discreetly. Alph. Assure your self ye shall: do ye see this sword Sir? He has not caft his teeth yet. Zanch. Rarely carried. Alph. He bites deep: most times mortall: Signiour Ile hound him at the fair and home. Zanch. Still nobly. Alph. And at all those that dare maintain ye. Zanch. Excellent. Leo. How you shall please Sir, so it be fair, though certain, I had rather give you reason. Zanch. Fairly urg'd too. Alph. This is no age for reason, prick your reason Upon your swords point. Zanch. Admirably follow'd. Alph. And there ile hear it: so till I please, live Sir. Exit Leo. And so farewell, you'r welcome. Zanch. The end crowns all things Signiour, some little businesse past, this cause ile argue And be a peace between ye, ift so please ye, And by the square of honour to the utmost: I feel the old man's master'd by much passion, And too high rackt, which makes him overshoot all. His valour should direct at, and hurt those That stand but by as blenchers: this he must know too, As necessary to his judgement, doting women Are neither safe nor wise adventures: conceive me, If once their wills have wander'd; nor is't then A time to use our rages: for why should I Bite at the stone, when he that throws it wrongs me? Do not we know that women are most wooers Though closest in their carriage? Do not all men know, Scarce all the compasse of the globe can hold 'em If their affections be afoot? shall I then covet The follys of a she-fool, that by nature Must seek her like, by reason be a woman, Sink a tal ship because the sales defie me? No, I disdain that folly; he that ventures Whilst they are fit to put him on, has found out The everlasting motion in his scabbard. I doubt not to make peace: and so for this time My best love, and remembrance. Leo. Your poor Servant. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na secunda. Enter Diego Host, Philippo, and Theodosia. Phil. Where will our Horses meet us? Host Dieg. Fear not you Sir, Some half mile hence, my worships man will stay us, How is it with my young bloods? come, be joviall, Let's travell like a merry flock of wild geese, Every tongue talking. Phil. We are very merry; But do you know this way Sir? Theo. Is't not dangerous? Methinks these woody thickets should harbour knaves. Host Die. I fear none but fair wenches: those are theeves. May quickly rob me of my good conditions If they cry stand once: but the best is Signiours They cannot bind my hands; for any else, They meet an equall knave, and there's my pasport: I have seen fine sport in this place, had these trees tongues, They would tell ye pretty matters: do not you fear though They are not every days delights. Phil. What sport Sir? Host. Why to say true, the sport of all sports. Phil. What was't? Host. Such turning up of taffataes; and you know To what rare whistling tunes they go, far beyond A soft wind in the shrowds: such stand there, And down ith thother place; such supplications And subdivisions for those toys their honours, One, as ye are a gentleman in this bush, And oh sweet Sir, what mean ye? ther's a bracelet, And use me I beseech ye like a woman, And her petition's heard: another scratches, And crys she will die first, and then swones: but certain She is brought to life again, and does well after. Another save mine honour, oh mine honour, My husband serves the Duke, Sir, in his kitchen; I have a cold pie for ye; fy, fy, fy gentlemen, Will nothing satisfie ye, where's my husband? Another crys, do ye see Sir how they use me, Is there no law for these things? Theo. And good mine Host, Do you call these fine sports? Host. What should I call 'em, They have been so call'd these thousand years &amp; upwards. Phil. But what becomes o'th' men? Host. They are stript and bound, Like so many Adams, with fig leafs afore 'em, And there's their innocence. Theo. Would we had known this? Before we reacht this place. Phil. Come, there's no danger, These are but sometimes chances. Enter Bayliffe. Host. Now we must through. Theo. Who's that? Host. Stand to it Signiors. Phil. No it needs not, I know the face; 'tis honest. Bayl. What mine Host: Mine everlasting honest Host. Host. Masse Bayly: Now in the name of an ill reckoning What make you walking this round? Bayl. Aâof this round, And of all businesse too, through woods, and rascalls, They have rounded me away a dozen duckets, Besides a fair round cloke: Some of 'em knew me, Els they had cased me like a cony too, As they have done the rest, and I think rosted me, For they began to baste me soundly: my young Signiors, You may thank heaven, and heartily, and hourly, You set not out so early; ye had been smoak'd els By this true hand ye had Sirs, finely smoakt, Had ye been women, smockt too. Theo. Heaven defend us. Bayl. Nay, that had been no prayer, there were those That run that prayer out of breath, yet fail'd too: There was a Fryer, now ye talk of prayer, With a huge bunch of beads, like a rope of onyons; I am sure as big, that out of fear and prayer, In half an houre wore 'em as small as bugles, Yet he was flea'd too. Phil. At what houre was this? Bayl. Some two houres since. Theo. Do you think the passage sure now. Bayl. Yes, a rope take 'em, as it will, and blesse 'em, They have done for this day sure. Phil. Are many riffled? Bayl. At the least a dozen, And there left bound. Theo. How came you free? Bayl. A curtesie They use out of their rogueships, to bequeath To one, that when they give a signe from far Which is from out of danger; he may presently Release the rest, as I met you, I was going, Having the signe from yonder hill to do it. Theo. Alas poor men. Phil. Mine Host, pray go untie 'em. Host. Let me alone for cancelling: where are they? Bayl. In every bush like black birds, you cannot misse 'em Host. I need not stalk unto 'em. Exit. Bayl. No, they'l stand ye, My busy life for yours Sir: you would wonder To see the severall tricks, and strange behaviors Of the poor rascals in their miseries, One weeps, another laughs at him for weeping, A third is monstrous angry he can laugh And crys, go too, this is no time; he laughs still, A fourth exhorts to patience: him a fift man Curses for tamenesse; him a Fryer schools, All hoot the Fryer: here one sings a Ballad, And there a little Curat confutes him, And in this linsey woolsey way, that would make a dog Forget his dinner, or an old man fire They rub out for their ransoms: Amongst the rest, There is a little Boy rob'd, a fine child, It seems a Page: I must confesse my pitty (As 'tis a hard thing in a man of my place) To shew compassion, stir'd at him; so finely And without noyse he carrys his afflictions, And looks as if he had but dreamt of loosing. Enter Host and Leocadia, and others as rob'd. This boy's the glory of this robbery, The rest but shame the action: now ye may hear 'em. Host. Come lads, 'tis holy-day: hang clothes, 'tis hot, And sweating agues are abroad. 1. It seems so; For we have met with rare Phisitians To cure us of that mallady. Host. Fine footing, Light and deliver: now my boys: Master Fryer, How do's your holinesse, bear up man; what A cup of neat sack now and a toast: ha, Fryer, A warm plaister to your belly Father, There were a blessing now. Fryer. Ye say your mind Sir. Host. Where my fine Boy: my poynter. Bayl. Ther's the wonder. Host. A rank whore scratch their sides till the pox follow For robbing thee, thou hast a thousand ways To rob thy self boy, dyce, and a chamber devill. Leoc. Ye are deceiv'd Sir. Host. And thy Master too Boy. Phil. A sweet fac'd Boy indeed: what rogues were these? What barbarous brutish slaves to strip this beauty? Theo. Come hither my boy: alas! he's cold, mine Host, We must intreat your Cloak. Host. Can ye intreat it. Phil. We do presume so much, you have other garments. Host. Will you intreat those too? Theo. Your Mule must too, To the next town, you say 'tis neer; in pity You cannot see this poor Boy perish. I know ye have a better soul, we'l satisfie ye. Host. 'Tis a strange foolish trick I have, but I cannot help it, I am ever cozen'd with mine own commendations; It is determin'd then I shall be robb'd too. To make up vantage to this dozen: here Sir, Heaven has provided ye a simple garment To set ye off: pray keep in hansomer Then you kept your own, and let me have it render'd, Brush'd, and discreetly folded. Leoc. I thank ye Sir. Host. Who wants a doblet? 2. I. Host. Where will you have it? 2. From you Sir, if you please. Host. Oh, there's the poyt Sir. Phil. My honest friends, I am sorry for your fortunes, But that's but poor relief; here are ten Duckets, And to your distribution holy Sir, I render 'em: and let it be your care To se 'em, as your wants are, well divided. Host. Plain dealing now my friends: and Father Fryer, Set me the sadle right; no wringing Fryer, Nor tithing to the Church, these are no duties; Scowre me your conscience, if the Devill tempt ye Off with your cord, and swing him. Fry. Ye say well Sir. all. Heaven keep your goodnesse. Theo. Peace keep you, farewell friends Host. Farewell light-horse-men. Exit the rob'd. Phil. Which way travell you Sir. Bayl. To the next town. The. Do you want any thing. Bayl. Only discretion to travell at good houres, And some warm meat to moderate this matter, For I am most outragious cruell hungry Host. I have a stomach too such as it is Would pose a right good pasty, I thank heaven for't. Bayl. Chees that would break the teeth of a new handsaw, I could endure now like an Eastrich, or salt beeffe That Cesar left in pickell. Phil. Take no care, Wee'l have meat for you and enough: I th'mean time Keep you the horse way lest the fellow misse us, We'l meet ye at the end o'th wood. Host. Make hast then. Exit. Host. &amp; Bayl. Theo. My pretty Sir, till your necessities Be full supplied, so please you trust our friendships, We must not part. Leo. Ye have pull'd a charge upon ye, Yet such a one, as ever shall be thankfull. Phil. Ye have said enough: may I be bold to ask ye, What Province you were bred in? and of what parents? Leo. Ye may Sir: I was born in Andoluzia, My name Francisco, son to Don Henriques De Cardinas. Theo. Our noble neighbour. Phil. Son to Don Henriques: I know the gentleman: and by your leave Sir, I know he has no son. Leo. None of his own Sir, Which makes him put that right upon his brother Don Zanchio's children: one of which I am, And therefore do not much err. Phil. Still ye do Sir, For neither has Don Zanchio any son; A daughter, and a rare one is heire, Which though I never was so blest to see, Yet I have heard great good of. Theo. Urge no further, He is ashamed, and blushes. Phil. Sir, If it might import you to conceal your self, I ask your mercy, I have been so curious: Leo. Alas! I must ask yours Sir: for these lies, Yet they were usefull ones; for by the claiming Such noble parents, I beleev'd your bounties Would shew more gracious: The plain truth is gentlemen, I am Don Sanchios stewards son, a wild boy, That for the fruits of his unhappinesse, Is faigne to seek the wars. Theo. This is a lie too. If I have any ears. Phil. Why? Theo. Mark his language, And ye shall find it of too sweet a relish For one of such a breed: ile pawn my hand, This is no boy. Phil. No boy? what would you have him? Theo. I know, no boy: I watcht how fearfully, And yet how sodainly he cur'd his lies, The right wit of a woman: Now I am sure. Phil. What are ye sure? Theo. That 'tis no boy: ile burn in't. Phil. Now I consider better, and take councell, Methinks he shows more sweetnesse in that face, Then his fears dare deliver. Theo. No more talk on't, There hangs some great waight by it: soon at night Ile tell ye more. Phil. Come Sir, what ere you are With us, embrace your liberty, and our helps In any need you have. Leo. All my poor service Shall be at your command Sir, and my prayers. Phil. Let's walke a pace; hunger will cut their throats els. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Rodorigo, Markantonio, and a Ship-master, two Chairs set out. Rod. Call up the Master. Mast. Here Sir. within. Rod. Honest Master, Give order all the Gallys with this tyde Fall round, and neer upon us; that the next wind We may waigh off together, and recover The Port of Barcelona, without parting. Mast. Your pleasures done Sir. within. Rod. Signior Markantonio, Till meat be ready, let's sit here and prepare Our stomachs with discourses. Marc. What you please Sir. Rod. Pray ye answer me to this doubt. Marc. If I can Sir. Rod. Why should such plants as you are, pleasures children That ow their blushing years to gentle objects, Tenderly bred, and brought up in all fulnesse, Desire the stubborn wars? Marc. In those 'tis wonder, That make their ease their god, and not their honour: But noble Generall, my end is other, Desire of knowledge Sir, and hope of tying Discretion to my time, which only shews me, And not my years, a man, and makes that more. Which we call handsome, the rest is but boys beauty, And with the boy consum'd. Rod. Ye argue well Sir. Mar. Nor do I wear my youth, as they were breches For object, but for use: my strength for danger, Which is the liberal part of man, not dalliance, The wars must be my Mistress Sir. Rod. O Signiour, You'l find her a rough wench. Mar. When she is won once, She'l show the sweeter Sir. Rod. You can be pleas'd, though Sometimes to take a tamer? Mar. 'Tis a truth Sir, So she be handsom, and not ill condition'd. Rod. A Soldier should not be so curious. Mar. I can make shift with any for a heat Sir. Rod. Nay, there you wrong your youth too: and however You are pleas'd to appear to me, which shews wel Signior, A tougher soul then your few years can testifie; Yet my yong Sir, out of mine own experience When my spring was, I am able to confute ye, And say, y'had rather come to th'shock of eys, And boldly march up to your Mistriss mouth, Then to the Cannons. Mar. That's as their lading is Sir. Rod. There be Trenches Fitter, and warmer for your years, and safer Then where the bullet plays. Mar. Ther's it I doubt Sir. Rod. You'l easily find that faith: But come, be liberal, What kind of woman could you make best wars with? Mar. They are all but heavy marches. Rod. Fy Marckantonio, Beauty in no more reverence? Mar. In the Sex Sir, I honor it, and next to honor, love it, For there is only beauty; and that sweetness That was first meant for modesty: sever it And put it in one woman, it appears not. 'Tis of too rare a nature, she too gross To mingle with it. Rod. This is a meer heresie. Marc. Which makes 'em ever mending; for that gloss That cosens us for beauty, is but bravery, An outward shew of things well set, no more, For heavenly beauty, is as heaven it self Sir, Too excellent for object, and what is seen Is but the vail then, airy clouds; grant this It may be seen, 'tis but like stars in twinklings. Rod. 'Twas no small study in their Libraries Brought you to this experience: But what think ye Of that fair red and white, which we call beauty? Mar. Why? 'tis our creature Sir, we give it 'em, Because we like those colours, else 'tis certain A blew face with a motley nose would do it, And be as great a beauty, so we lov'd it, That we cannot give, which is only beauty, Is a fair Mind. Rod. By this rule, all our choices Are to no ends. Marc. Except the dull end, Doing. Rod. Then all to you seem equal? Marc. Very true Sir, And that makes equal dealing: I love any That's worth love. Rod. How long love ye Signiour? Marc. Till I have other business. Rod. Do you never Love steadfastly one woman? Mar. 'Tis a toyl Sir Like riding in one rode perpetually, It offers no variety. Rod. Right youth, He must needs make a Soldier; nor do you think One woman, can love one man. Mar. Yes that may be, Though it appear not often; they are things ignorant, And therefore apted to that superstition Of doting fondness; yet of late years Signior, That worlds well mended with 'em, fewer are found now That love at length, and to the right mark, all Stir now as the time stirs; fame and fashion Are ends they aim at now, and to make that love That wiser ages held ambition; They that cannot reach this, may love by Index; By every days surveying who best promises, Who has done best, who may do, and who mended May come to do again; who appears neatest Either in new stampt cloths, or curtesies, Done but from hand to mouth neither; nor love they these things Longer then new are making, nor that succession Beyond the next fair feather: Take the City, There they go to't by gold waight, no gain from 'em All they can work by fire and water to 'em, Profit is all they point at: if there be love 'Tis shew'd ye by so dark a light, to bear out The bracks, and old stains in it, that ye may purchase French velvet better cheap: all loves are endless. Rod. Faith, if ye have a Mistress, would she heard you. Mar. 'Twere but the ventring of my place, or swearing I meant it but for argument, as Schoolmen Dispute high questions. Rod. What a world is this When young men dare determine what those are? Age and the best experience ne'r could aim at. Marc. They were thick ey'd then Sir; now the print is bigger, And they may read their fortunes without spectacles. Rod. Did you ne'r love? Mar. Faith yes, once after supper, And the fit held till midnight. Rod. Hot, or shaking. Mar. To say true, both. Rod. How did ye rid it? Mar. Thus Sir, I laid my hand upon my heart, and blest me, And then said over certain charms I had learn'd Against mad dogs, for love, and they are all one; Last thought upon a windmill, and so slept, And was well ever after. Rod. A rare Physitian, What would your practise gain ye? Mar. The wars ended, I mean to use my heart, and have these fools Cut in the head like Cats, to save the Kingdom, Another Inquisition. Rod. So old a Soldier. Out of the wars, I never knew yet practised. Mar. I shall mend every day; But noble General, Believe this, but as this you nam'd discourses. Rod. O ye are a cunning Gamster. Mar. Mirths and toys To cosen time withall, for O my troth Sir, I can love; I think, well too; well enough And think as wel of women as they are, Pretty fantastick things, some more regardful, And some few worth a service: I am so honest, I with 'em all in heaven, and you know hard Sir 'Twill be to get in there with their great farthingalls. Rod. Well Marckantonio, I would not loose thy company For the best Galley I command. Marc. Faith Generall, If these discourses please ye, I shall fit ye Once every day. knock within. Rod. Thou canst not please me better: hark, they call Below to Didner: ye are my Cabbin guest, My bosom's, so you please Sir. Marc. Your poor Servant. Exeunt. Scena quarta. Enter Philipo, and second Host.

Run it o're with garlick, And make a Roman dish on't. Hostess. Pray ye be patient, And get provision in; these are fine Gentlemen, And liberal Gentlemen; they have unde quare No mangey Muleters, nor pinching Posts That feed upon the parings of musk-millions And radishes, as big and tough as rafters: Will ye be stirring in this business? here's your brother Mine old Host of Ossuva, as wise as you are, That is, as knavish; if ye put a trick, Take heed he do not find it. Host. Ile be wagging. Hostess. 'Tis for your own commodity: why wenches. Anon forsooth. within. Hostess. Who makes a fire there? and who gets in water? Let Oliver go to the Justice, and beseech his worship We may have two spits going; and do you here Druce, Let him invite his worship, and his wives worship, To the left meat to morrow. Enter Bayliff. Bayl. Where's the Kitchen? Hostess. Even at the next door Signior: what old Don? We meet but seldom. Bayl. Prethee be patient Hostess, And tell me where the meat is. Hostess. Faith Master Bayly, How have ye done? and how man? Bayl. Good sweet Hostess, What shall we have to dinner? Hostess. How do's your woman, And a fine woman she is and a good woman, Lord, how you bear your years? Bayl. Is't veal, or mutton, Beef, bacon, pork, kid, pheasant, or all these, And are they ready all? Hostess. The hours that have been Between us two, the merry hours. Lord! Bayl. Hostess, Dear Hostess do but hear; I am hungry. Hostess. Ye are merrily dispos'd Sir. Bayl. Monstrous hungry, And hungry after much meat, I have brought hither Right worshipful to pay the reckoning, Money enough too with 'em, desire enough To have the best meat, and of that enough too: Come to the point sweet wench, and so I kiss thee. Hostess. Ye shall have any thing, and instantly Ere you can lick your ears, Sir. Bayl. Portly meat, Bearing substantial stuff, and fit for hunger: I do beseech ye Hostess first, then some light garnish, Two pheasants in a dish, if ye have leverits, Rather for way of ornament, then appetite They may be look'd upon, or larks: for fish, As there is no great need, so I would not wish ye To serve above four dishes, but those full ones; Ye have no cheese of Parma? Hostess. Very old Sir. Bayl. The less will serve us, some ten pound, Hostess. Alas Sir, We have not half these dainties. Bayl. Peace good Hostess, And make us hope ye have. Hostess. Ye shall have all Sir, Bayl. That may be got for money. Enter Diego the Host, and a Boy. 1. Host. Diego. Where's your Master? Bring me your Master boy: I must have liquor Fit for the Mermedons; no dashing now child, No conjurings by candle light, I know all; Strike me the oldest Sack, a piece that carries Point blank to this place boy, and batters; Hostess, I kiss thy hands through which many a round reckoning And things of moment have had motion. Hostess. Still mind old Brother. 1. Host Dei.

Pray bargain for it, And I will be the pay-master. 2. Host. I will Sir. Phil. And let our meat be ready when you please, I mean as soon. 2. Host. It shall be presently. Phil. How far stands Barcellona? 2. Host. But two leagues off Sir, You may be there by three a clock. Phil. I am glad on't. Exeunt. Scena secunda. Enter Theodosia, and Leocadia. Theo. Signior Francisco why I draw you hither To this remote place, marvel not, for trust me My innocence yet never knew ill dealing, And as ye have a noble temper, start not Into offence, at any thing my knowledg, And for your special good, would be inform'd of, Nor think me vainly curious. Leoc. Worthy Sir, The courtesies you and your noble Brother Even then when few men find the way to do 'em, I mean in want, so freely showrd upon me, So truly and so timely minister'd, Must if I should suspect those minds that made 'em, Either proclaim me an unworthy taker, Or worse, a base believer; Speak your mind Sir Freely, and what you please, I am your Servant. The. Then my yong Sir, know since our first acquaintance Induc'd by circumstances that deceive not To clear some doubts I have; nay blush not Signior, I have beheld ye narrowly; more blushes! Sir, ye give me so much light, I find ye A thing confest already; yet more blushes? You would ill cover an offence might sink ye That cannot hide your self; why do ye shake so? I mean no trouble to ye; this fair hand Was never made for hardness, nor those eys. Come do not hide 'em, for rough objects, hark ye, Ye have betrayd your self, that sigh confirms me; An other? and a third to? then I see These Boys clothes do but pinch ye, come be liberal, Ye have found a friend that has found you, disguise not That loaden soul that labors to be open: Now you must weep, I know it, for I see Your eys down laden to the lids, another Manifest token that my doubts are perfect; Yet I have found a greater; till me this Why were these holes left open, there was an error, A foul one my Francisco, have I caught ye? O pretty Sir, the custom of our Country Allows men none in this place: Now the showr comes. Leoc. O Signior Theodoro. Theo. This sorrow shews so sweetly I cannot chuse but keep it company: Take truce and speak Sir: and I charge your goodness by all those perfect hopes that point at vertue By that remembrance these fair tears are shed for, If any sad mis-fortune have thus form'd ye, That either care or counsel may redeem, Pain, purse, or any thing within the power And honor of free Gentlemen, reveal it, And have our labors. Leoc. I have found ye noble And ye shall find me true; your doubts are certain, Nor dare I more dissemble; I am a woman, The great example of a wretched woman; Here you must give me leave to shew my Sex; And now to make ye know how much your credit Has won upon my soul, so it please your patience, Ile tell you my unfortunate sad story. Theo. Sit down and say on Lady. Leoc. I am born Sir Of good and honest parents, rich, and noble, And not to lye, the daughter of Don Zanchio, If my unhappy fortune have not lost me: My name cal'd Leocadia, even the same Your worthy brother did the special honor To name for beautiful; and without pride I have been often made believe so Signior; But thats impertinent: Now to my sorrows; Not far from us a Gentleman of worth, A neighbor and a noble visitor, Had his aboad; who often met my Father In gentle sports of chase, and river hawking, In course and riding, and with him often brought A Son of his, a young and hopeful Gentleman, Nobly train'd up, in years fit for affection, A sprighly man, of understanding excellent, Of speech, and civill 'havior, no less powerful; And of all parts, else my eys lyed, abundant: We grew acquainted, and from that acquaintance Neerer into affection; from affection Into belief. Theo. Well. Leoc. Then we durst kiss. Theo. Go forward. Leoc. But O man, man, unconstant, careless man, O subtile man, how many are thy mischiefs? O Marck-antonio, I may curse those kisses. Theo. What did you call him Lady? Leoc. Mark antonio, The name to me of misery. Theo. Pray foreward. Leoc. From these we bred desires Sir: but lose me heaven If mine were lustful. Theo. I believe. Leoc. This neerness Made him importunate: When to save mine honor Love having full possession of my powers, I got a contract from him. Theo. Sealed? Leoc. And sworn too: Which since for some offence heaven laid upon me I lost among my moneys in the robbery, The loss that makes me poorest: this won from him Fool that I was, and too too credulous, I pointed him a by-way to my chamber The next night at an hour. Theo. Pray stay there Lady: And when the night came, came he, kept he touch with ye? Be not so shamefast: had he both your wishes? Tell me, and tell me true, did he injoy ye, Were ye in one anothers arms, abed? the Contract Confirm'd in full joys there? did he lie with ye? Answer to that; ha? did your father know this, The good old man, or kindred privy to't? And had ye their consents? did that nights promise Make ye a Mother? Leoc. Why do you ask so neerly? Good Sir, do's it concern you any thing? Theo. No Lady, Only the pitty why you should be used so, A little stirs me, but did he keep his promise? Leoc. No, no Signior, Alas he never came nor never meant it, My love was fool'd, time numbred to no end, My expectation flouted, and ghess you Sir, What dor unto a doating Maid this was, What a base breaking off. Theo. All's well then Lady; Go forward in your Story. Leoc. Not only fail'd Sir Which is a curse in love, and may he find it When his affections are full wing'd, and ready To stoop upon the quarry, then when all His full hopes are in's arms: not only thus Sir But more injurious, faithless, treacherous, Within two days fame gave him far remov'd With a new love, which much against my conscience But more against my cause, which is my hell I must confess a fair one, a right fair one, Indeed of admirable sweetness, Daughter Unto another of our noble neighbors The thief cal'd Theodosia; whose perfections I am bound to ban for ever, curse to wrinckles, As heaven I hope will make 'em soon; and aches, For they have rob'd me poor unhappy wench Of all, of all Sir, all that was my glory And left me nothing but these tears, and travel: Upon this certain news, I quit my Father And if you be not milder in construction I fear mine honor too; and like a Page Stole to Ossuna: from that place to Civill, From thence to Barcellona I was travelling When you o'er-took my misery, in hope to hear of Gallies bound up for Italy; for never Will I leave off the search of this bad man This filcher of affections, this love Pedler, Nor shall my curses cease to blast her beauties And make her name as wandring as her nature Till standing face to face before their lusts I call heavens justice down. Theo. This shows too angry Nor can it be her fault she is belov'd, If I give meat, must they that eat it surfeit? Leoc. She loves again Sir, there's the mischief of it And in despight of me to drown my blessings Which she shall dearly know. Theo. Ye are too violent. Leoc. She has Devils in her eys, to whose devotion He offers all his service. Theo. Who can say But she may be forsaken too? he that once wanders From such a perfect sweetness, as you promise Has he not still the same rule to deceive? Leoc. No, no they are together, love together Past all deceipt of that side; sleep together, Live, and delight together, and such deceipt Give me in a wild desert. Theo. By your leave Lady I see no honor in this cunning. Leoc. Honor? True, none of her part, honor, she deserves none, 'Tis ceas'd with wandering Ladies such as she is, So bold and impudent. Theo. I could be angry Extreamly angry now beyond my nature And 'twere not for my pitty: what a man is this to do these wrongs: believe me Lady I know the maid, and know she is not with him. Leoc. I would you knew she were in heaven. Theo. And so well know her That I think you are cozend. Leoc. So I say Sir. Theo. I mean in her behaviour For trust my faith so much I dare adventure for her credit She never yet delighted to do wrong: Leoc. How can she then delight in him; dare she think Be what she will, as excellent as Angels My love so fond, my wishes so indulgent That I must take her prewnings; stoop at that She has tyr'd upon: No Sir, I hold my beauty Wash but these sorrows from it; of a sparkle As right and rich as hers, my means as equal, My youth as much unblown: and for our worths And waight of vertue. Theo. Do not task her so far. Leo. By heaven she is cork, and clouds, light, light sir, vapor But I shall find her out, with all her witchcrafts, Her paintings, and her powncings: for 'tis art And only art preserves her, and meer spels That work upon his powers: let her but shew me A ruin'd cheek like mine, that holds his colour And writes but sixteen years in spight of sorrows An unbathed body, smiles, that give but shadows And wrinckle not the face: besides she is little A demy dame that, that makes no object. Theo. Nay, Then I must say you err: for credit me I think she is taller then your self. Leoc. Why let her It is not that shall mate me: I but ask My hands may reach unto her. Theo. Gentle Lady 'Tis now ill time of further argument, For I perceive your anger voyd of councel, Which I could wish more temperate. Leoc. Pray forgive me If I have spoken uncivilly: they that look on See more than we that play: and I beseech ye Impute it loves offence, not mine; whose torments, If you have ever lov'd, and found my crosses You must confesse are seldom ty'd to patience, Yet I could wish I had said lesse. Theo. No harm then; Ye have made a full amends; our Company You may command, so please you in your travels With all our faith and furtherance; let it be so. Leoc. Ye make too great an offer. Theo. Then it shal be Go in and rest your self, our wholsom dyet Will be made ready straight: But hark ye Lady One thing I must entreat, your leave, and sufferance That these things may be open to my Brother For more respect and honour. Leoc. Do your pleasure. Theo. And do not change this habit by no means Unless ye change your self. Leoc. Which must not yet be. Theo. It carries ye concealed and safe. Leoc. I am counsel'd. Exit. Enter Philippo. Phil. What's done? Theo. Why all we doubted; 'tis a woman, And of a noble strain too, ghesse. Phil. I cannot. Theo. You have heard often of her. Phil. Stay I think not. Theo. Indeed ye have; 'tis the fair Leocadia Daughter unto Don Zanchio, our noble neighbor. Phil. Nay? Theo. 'Tis she Sir o' my credit. Phil. Leocadia, Pish Leocadia, it must not be. Theo. It must be, or be nothing. Phil. Pray give me leave to wonder, Leocadia? Theo. The very same. Phil. The damsel Leocadia I ghest it was a woman, and a fair one I see it through her shape, transparant plain But that it should be she; tell me directly. Theo. By heavens 'tis shee. Phil. By heaven then 'tis a sweet one. Theo. That's granted too. Phil. But heark ye, heark ye Sister, How came she thus disguis'd? Theo. Ile tell you that too As I came on the self-same ground, so us'd too. Phil. By the same man? Theo. The same too. Phil. As I live You lovers have fine fancies, Wonderous fine ones. Theo. Pray heaven you never make one. Phil. Faith I know not, But in that mind I am, I had rather cobble, 'Tis a more Christian trade; pray tell me one thing Are not you two now monstrous jealous Of one another? Theo. She is much of me And has rayl'd at me most unmercifully And to my face, and o' my conscience Had she but known me, either she or I Or both, had parted with strange faces She was in such a fury. Phil. Leocadia? Do's she speak hansomly? Theo. Wondrous wel Sir And all she do's becomes her, even her anger. Phil. How seem'd she when you found her? Theo. Had you seen How sweetly fearfull her pretty self Betray'd her self, how neat her sorrow show'd, And in what hansom phrase shee put her story, And as occasion stir'd her how she started Though roughly, yet most aptly into anger You would have wonder'd. Phil. Do's she know ye? Theo. No, Nor must not by no means. Phil. How stands your difference? Theo. Ile tell ye that some fitter time, but trust me My Marck-antonio has too much to answer. Phil. May I take knowledge of her? Theo. Yes she is willing. Phil. Pray use her as she is, with all respects then, For she is a woman of a noble breeding. Theo. Ye shal not find me wanting. Phil. Which way bears she? Theo. Our way, and to our end. Phil. I am glad on't; heark ye, She keeps her shape? Enter Leocadia. Theo. Yes, and I think by this time Has mew'd her old. Phil. She is here: by heaven a rare one, An admirable sweet one, what an eye Of what a full command she bears, how gracious All her aspect shows; bless me from a feavor I am not well o'th sodain. Leoc. Noble friends Your meat and all my service waits upon ye. Phil. Ye teach us manners Lady; all which service Must now be mine to you, and all too poor too; Blush not, we know ye; for by all our faiths With us your honor is in sanctuary And ever shal be. Leoc. I do well beleeve it, Will ye walk neerer Sir. Exit. Theo. She shows still fairer, Yonger in every change, and clearer, neater; I know not, I may fool my self, and finely Nourish a wolfe to eat my heart out; Certain As she appears now, she appears a wonder, A thing amazes me; what would she do then In womans helps, in ornaments apt for her And deckings to her delicacy? without all doubt She would be held a miracle; nor can I think He has forsaken her: Say what shee please, I know his curious eye, or say he had, Put case he could be so boy-blind and foolish, Yet stil I fear she keeps the Contract with her Not stolne as she affirms, nor lost by negligence, She would loose her self first, 'tis her life, and there All my hopes are dispatch'd; O noble love That thou couldst be without this jealousie, Without this passion of the heart, how heavenly Would thou appear upon us? Come what may come Ile see the end on't: and since chance has cast her Naked into my refuge, all I can She freely shal command, except the man. Exit. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Leonardo, and Don Pedro. Leon. Don Pedro, do you think assuredly The Gallyes will come round to Barcellona Within these two dayes? Ped. Without doubt. Leo. And think ye He will be with 'em certainly? Ped. He is sir I saw him at their setting off. Leo. Must they needs Touch there for water as you say? Ped. They must sir And for fresh meat too: few or none go by it Beside so great a Fleet must needs want trimming If they have met with fowle seas, and no harbour On this side Spain, is able without danger To moore 'em, but that haven. Leo. Are the warrs His only end? Ped. So he professes. Leo. Bears he Any command amongst 'em? Ped. Good regard With all; which quickly will prefer him. Leo. Pray Sir tell me, And as you are a gentleman be liberal. Ped. I will Sir, and most true. Leo. Who saw ye with him? Ped. None but things like himself; yong soldiers And gentlemen desirous to seek honor. Leo. Was there no woman there, nor none disguis'd That might be thought a woman in his language? Did he not let slip something of suspition Touching that wanton way. Ped. Beleeve me Sir I neither saw, nor could suspect that face That might be doubted womans, yet I am sure Aboard him I see all that past, and 'tis impossible Among so many high set bloods there should be A woman, let her close her self within a cockle, But they would open her, he must not love Within that place alone, and therefore surely He would not be so foolish, had he any, To trust her there; for his discourse, 'twas ever About his business, war, or mirth to make us Relish a Can of wine wel; when he spoke private 'Twas only the remembrance of his service, And hope of your good prayers for his health Sir, And so I gave him to the seas. Leo. I thank ye, And now am satisfied, and to prevent Suspitions that may nourish dangers Signior, For I have told you how the mad Alphenso Chafes like a Stag i'th' toyl, and bends his fury 'Gainst all, but his own ignorance; I am determin'd For peace sake and the preservation Of my yet untouch'd honor, and his cure My self to seek him there, and bring him back As testimony of an unsought injurie By either of our actions; That the world And he if he have reason, may see plainly Opinion is no perfect guide; nor all fames Founders of truths: In the mean time this courtesie I must entreat of you Sir, Be my self here And as my self command my family. Ped. Ye lay too much trust on me. Leo. 'Tis my love Sir, I wil not be long from ye; if this question Chance to be call'd upon ere my return I leave your care to answer; So farewell Sir. Ped. Ye take a wife way; All my best endeavors Shal labor in your absence; peace go with ye. Exit Lec. A noble honest gentleman, free hearted And of an open faith, much loving, and much loved, And father of that goodnesse only malice Can truly stir against; what dare befall Till his return Ile answer. Exit Ped. Enter Alphonso, and Servant. Alph. Walk off Sirha But keep your self within my call? Serv. I will Sir. Alp. And stir my horse for taking cold: within there, Hoa people; you that dwel there, my brave Signior What are ye all a sleep? is't that time with ye? Ile ring a little lowder. Enter Pedro. Ped. Sir who seek ye? Alph. Not you Sir; Where's your Master? Ped. I serve no man In way of pay sir. Alph. Where's the man o'th house then? Ped. What would you have with him Sir? Alph. Do you stand here Sir To ask men questions when they come? Ped. I would sir Being his friend, and hearing such allarums Know how men come to visit him. Alph. Ye shall sir, Pray tell his mightiness here is a gentleman By name Alphonso, would entreat his conference About affairs of state sir, are ye answer'd? Enter Sanchio carried. Ped. I must be sir. Sanch. Stay, set me down, stay Signior, You must stay, and ye shall stay. Alph. Meaning me sir? Sanch. Yes you Sir, you I mean, I mean you. Alph. Well Sir, Why should I stay? Sanch. There's reason. Alph. Reason Sir? Sanch. I reason sir My wrong is greatest, and I will be serv'd first, Call out the man of fame? Alph. How serv'd sir? Sanch. Thus sir. Alph. But not before me. Sanch. Before all the world sir As my case stands. Alph. I have lost a daughter sir. Sanch. I have lost another worth five score of her sir. Alph. Ye must not tel me so. Sanch. I have, and heark ye? Make it up five score more: Call out the fellow, And stand you by sir. Ped. This is the mad morrisse. Alph. And I stand by? Sanch. I say stand by, and do it. Alph. Stand by among thy lungs. Sanch. Turn presently And say thy prayers, thou art dead. Alph. I scorn thee And scorn to say my prayers more then thou do'st, Mine is the most wrong, and my daughter deerest And mine shal first be righted. Sanch. Shal be righted. Ped. A third may live I see, pray hear me gentlemen. Sanch. Shalbe. Alph. I, shal be righted. Sanch. Now? Alph. Now. Sanch. Instantly. Alph. Before I stir. Sanch. Before me. Alph. Before any. Sanch. Dost thou consider what thou say'st? hast thou friends here Able to quench my anger, or perswade me After I have beaten thee into one main bruist And made thee spend thy state in rotten apples, Thou canst at length be quiet, shal I kil thee Divide thee like a rotten Pumpion, And leave thee stincking to posterity, Ther's not the least blow I shall give; but do's this Urge me no further: I am first. Alph. Ile hang first. No goodman glory, 'tis not your bravado's, Your punctuall honor, nor soldadoship. Sanch. Set me a little neerer. Alph. Let him sally. S. Lin'd with your quircks of carriage and discretion Can blow me off my purpose. Wher's your credit With all your school points now? your decent arguing And apt time for performing: where are these toys, These wise ways, and most honourable courses, To take revenge? how dar'st thou talk of killing, Or think of drawing any thing but squirts When letchery has dry founderd thee? Sanch. Neerer yet, That I may spit him down: thou look'st like a man. Ped. I would be thought so Sir. Sanch. Prethee do but take me, And fling me upon that Puppy. Alph. Do for heavens sake, And see but how ile hug him. Sanch. Yet take warning. Ped. Faith gentlemen, this is a needlesse quarrell. Sanch. And do you desire to make one? Ped. As a friend Sir, To tell you all this anger is but lost Sir, For Leonardo is from home. Alph. No, no Sir. Ped. Indeed he is. Sanch. Where dare he be, but here Sir, When men are wrong'd, and come for satisfactions. Ped. It seems he has done none Sir; for his businesse Cleer of those cares, hath carried him for sometime To Barcelona; if he had been guilty, I know he would have staid, and cleer'd all difference Either by free confession, or his sword. Sanch. This must not be. Ped. Sure, as I live, it is Sir. Alph. Sure, as we all live, He's run away for ever: Barcelona, Why? 'tis the key for Italy, from whence He stole first hither. Sanch. And having found his knaveries Too grosse to be forgiven, and too open, He has found the same way back again: I beleeve too The good grasse gentleman, for his own ease, Has taken one oth' Pillyes: Is not his stuffe sold. Alph. I fear his worships shoos too; to escape us, I do not think he has a dish within dores, A louse left of his linnage. Ped. Ye are too wide Sir. Alph. Or one poor wooden spoon, Ped. Come in and see Sir. Alph. Ile see his house on fire first. Ped. Then be pleas'd Sir To give better censure. Sanch. I will after him, And search him like conceal'd land; but ile have him, And though I find in his shrift, ile kill him. Alph. Ile bear ye company. Sanch. Pray have a care then, A most especiall care, indeed a fear, Ye do not anger me. Alph. I will observe ye, And if I light upon him hansomly. Sanch. Kill but a peece of him, leave some Alphonso For your poor friends. Ped. I fear him not for all this. Alph. Shall we first go home, For it may prove a voyage, and dispose Of things there; heaven knows what may follow. Sanch. No, Ile kill him in this shirt I have on: let things Govern themselves, I am master of my honor At this time, and no more; let wife, and land, Lie lay till I return. Alph. I say amen to't: But what care for our monies? Sanch. I will not spend Above three shillings, till his head be here, Foure is too great a sum for all his fortunes. Come take me up instantly. Alph. Farewell to you Sir, And if your friend be in a featherbed, Sow'd up to shrowd his fears, tell him 'tis folly, For no course but his voluntary hanging Can get our pardons. Exeunt. Ped. These I think would be Offence enough, if their own indiscretions Would suffer 'em: two of the old seditions, When they want enemies, they are their own foes: Were they a little wiser, I should doubt 'em: Till when ile ne'r break sleep, nor suffer hunger For any harm he shall receive: For 'tis as easie If he be guilty, to turn these two old men Upon their own throats, and look on, and live still, As 'tis to tell five pound: a great deal sooner, And so ile to my meat, and then to hawking.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. IV. Scaena I. Enter Markantonio, and a Gentleman. Marc. Sir, this is complement; I pray you leave me. Gent. Sir, is it not? Marc. Why? I would only see the Town. Gent. And only that I come to shew you. Marc. Which I can see without you. Gent. So you may Plainly, not safely: For such difference As you have seen betwixt the sea and earth When waves rise high, and land would beat 'em back As fearfull of Invasion; such we find When we land here at Barcelona. Marc. Sir. Gent. Besides our Generall of the Gallyes, fearing Your hasty nature, charg'd me not return Without you safe. Marc. O Sir, that Rodorigo Is noble, and he do's mistake my temper. There is not in the world, a mind lesse apt To conceive wrongs, or do 'em; ha's he seen me In all this voyage, in the which he pleases Enter Eugenia, with divers Attendents. To call me friend, let slip a hasty word? 'S'light Sir: yonder is a Lady vaild, For propernesse, beyond comparison, And sure her face is like the rest: we'l see't. Gent. Why? you are hasty Sir already: know you What 'tis you go about. Marc. Yes, I would see The womans face. Gent. By heaven you shall not do't: You do not know the custome of the place: Iob. Bacon ready to shoot off a Pistol. To draw that curtain here, though she were mean, Is mortall. Marc. Is it? earth must come to earth At last, and by my troth, ile try it Sir. Gent. Then I must hold you fast. By all the faith That can be plac'd in man, 'tis an attempt More dangerous then death: 'tis death and shame: I know the Lady well. Marc. Is she a Lady? I shall the more desire to see her Sir. Gent. She is Alanso's wife, the Governor, A noble gentleman. Marc. Then let me go, If I can win her, you and I will govern This Town Sir, fear it not, and we will alter These barbarous customes then; for every Lady Shall be seen daily, and seen over too. Gent. Come, do not jest, nor let your passions bear you To such wild enterprises: hold you still, For as I have a soul, you shall not do't. Rod. She is a Lady of unblemishd'd fame, above. And here to offer that affront, were base? Hold on your way, and we will see the Town, And overlook the Ladyes. Marc. I am school'd, And promise you I will: But good Sir, see, She will passe by us now; if hope I may Salute her thus far off. Gent. 'S foot, are you mad? 'Twill be as ill as th'other. 1. Attend. What's the matter? What would that fellow have? Gent. Good Sir forbear. 1. Atte. It seems you are new landed: would you beg Any thing here? Marc. Yes Sir, all happinesse To that fair Lady, as I hope. Gent. Marckantonio. Marc. Her face, which needs no hiding: I would beg A sight of. Gent. Now go on, for 'tis too late To keep this from a tumult. 1. Attend. Sirrah, you Shall see a fitter object for your eyes, Then a fair Ladies face. Eug. For heavens sake, raise not A quarrell in the streets for me. 1. Attend. Slip in then; This is your door. Eug. Will you needs quarrell then? 1. Attend. We must, or suffer This outrage: is't not all your minds sirs, speak? all. Yes. Eug. Then I do beseech ye, let my Lord Enter three or four Soldiers. Not think the quarrell about mee; for 'tis not. Exit. Gent. See, happily some of our Galley Soldiers Are come a shore. 1. Attend. Come on Sir, you shall see Faces enough. Gent. Some one of you call to Enter certain Townsmen. Our Generall, the whole rore of the Town Comes in upon us. Marc. I have seen Sir better Perhaps, then that was cover'd; and will yet Enter Philippo, Theodosia, and Leocadia. See that, or spoil yours. fight Phil. On: why start you back? Theo. Alas Sir, they are fighting. Leoc. Let's begon, See, see, a hansome man strook down. Gent. Ho Generall, Look out, Antonio is in distresse. Enter Rodorigo above. Theo. Antonio? Leoc. Antonio! 'tis he. Rod. within. Ho, Governor make a shot into the Town, Ile part you: bring away Antonio a shot. Into my Cabben. Exit Attendents and Townsmen. Gent. I will do that office. I fear It is the last, that I shall do him. Exit Soldiers and Gentlemen with Marckantonio. Theo. The last, why will he die? Leoc. Since I have found him: happinesse leave me, When I leave him. Exit. Phil. Why Theodosia? My Sister; wake: alas, I griev'd but now To see the streets so full; and now I grieve To see 'em left so empty: I could wish, Tumult himself were here, that yet at least Amongst the band, I might espie some face So pale and fearfull, that would willingly Embrace an arrand for a Cordiall, Or AquavitÃ¦, or a cup of sack, Or a Phisitian: But to talk of these She breaths: stand up, O Theodosia, Speak but as thou wert wont, give but a sigh, Which is but the most unhappy peece of life, And I will ever after worship Sadnes, Apply my self to grief; prepare and build Altars to sorrow. Theo. O Philippo, help me. Phil. I do; these are my arms; Philippo's arms, Thy Brothers arms that hold thee up. Theo. You help me To life: but I would see Antonio That's dead. Phil. Thou shalt see any thing; how dost thou? Theo. Better, I thank you. Phil. Why that's well: call up Thy sences, and uncloud thy cover'd spirits. How now? Theo. Recover'd: but Antonio, Where is he? Phil. We will find him: art thou well? Theo. Perfectly well, saving the misse of him; And I do charge you here, by our allyance, And by the love which would have been betwixt us, Knew we no kindred; by that killing fear, Mingled with twenty thousand hopes and doubts, Which you may think, plac'd in a Lovers heart, And in a Virgins too, when she wants help, To grant me your assistance, to find out This man alive, or dead; and I will pay you In service, tears, or prayers, a world of wealth: But other treasure, I have none: alas! You men have strong hearts; but we feeble maids Have tender eyes, which only given be Yo blind themselves, crying for what they see. Phil. Why do'st thou charge me thus? have I been found Slow to perform, what I could but imagine Thy wishes were; have I at any time Tender'd a businesse of mine own, beyond A vanity of thine? have I not been As if I were a senslesse creature, made To serve thee without pow'r of questioning, If so, why fear'st thou? Theo. I am satisfied. Phil. Come, then let's go: wher's Leocadia? Theo. I know not Sir. Phil. Wher's Leocadia? Theo. I do not know. Phil. Leocadia, This Tumult made the streets as dead as night, A man may talk as freely: what's become Of Leocadia? Theo. She's run away. Phil. Begone, and let us never more behold Each others face, till we may both together Fasten our eyes on her: accursed be Those tender cozening names of charity, And naturall affection, they have lost Me only by observing them, what cost Travell, and fruitlesse wishes may in vain Search through the world, but never find again. Theo. Good Sir be patient, I have done no fault Worthy this banishment. Phil. Yes, Leocadia, The Lady so distress'd, who was content To lay her story, and to lay her heart As open as her story to your self, Who was content, that I should know her Sex, Before dissembl'd, and to put her self Into my conduct, when I undertook Safely to guard, is in this Tumult lost. Theo. And can I help it Sir? Phil. No, would thou couldst, You might have done, but for that scale religion You woman bear to swownings, you do pick Your times to faint, when some body is by: Bound or by nature, or by love, or service To raise you from that well dissembled death: Inform me but of one that has been found Dead in her private chamber by her self, Where sicknesse would no more forbear, then here, And I will quit the rest for her. Theo. I know not What they may do, and how they may dissemble; But by my troth, I did not. Phil. By my troth, Would I had try'd; would I had let thee layen, And followed her. Theo. I would you had done so Rather, then been so angry: wher's Antonio? Phil. Why do'st thou vex me with these questions? Ile tell thee where, he's carried to the Gallyes, There to be chain'd, and row, and beat, and row With knotted ropes, and pizzels; if he swound, He has a dotes of bisket. Theo. I am glad He is alive. Phil. Was ever man thus troubled, Tell me where Leocadia is? Theo. Good brother be not so hasty, and I think I can: You found no error in me, when I first Told you she was a woman, and beleeve me Something I have found out, which makes me think, Nay, almost know so well, that I durst swear She follow'd hurt Antonio. Phil. What do we Enter the Governor, two Attendents, and the Townsmen. Then lingring here; we will aboard the Gallyes And find her. Gov. Made he a shot into the Town? 1. Attend. He did Sir. Gov. Call back those Gentlemen. 1. Attend. The Governour, commands you back. Phil. We will obey him Sir. Gov. You gave him cause to shoot, I know; he is So far from rash offence, and holds with me Such curious friendship: could not one of you Have call'd me while 'twas doing, such an uproar, Before my dore too? 1. Townsm. By my troth Sir, we were so busy in the publick cause, of our own Private falling out, that we forgot it; at home we see now You were not, but as soon as the shot made us fly, we ran Away as fast as we could to seek your honour. Gov. 'Twas gravely done; but no man tels the cause Or chance, or what it was that made you differ. 1. Towns. For my part Sir, if there were any that I knew Of, the shot drove it out of my head: do you know any neighbours. all. Not we, not we. Gov. Not we! nor can you tell. 1. Attend. No other cause, But the old quarrell betwixt the Town and the Gallyes. Gov. Come neerer Gentlemen: what are your names? Phil. My name Philippo. Theo. And mine Theodoro. Gov. Strangers you are it seems. Phil. Newly ariv'd. Gov. Then you are they begun this Tumult. Phil. No Sir. Gov. Speak one of you. 1. Attend. They are not, I can quiet 'em. Theo. Yet we saw part, and an unhappy part Of this debate, a long sought friend of ours Strook down for dead, and borne unto the Gallyes, His name is Markantonio. Phil. And another Of our own company, a Gentleman Of noble birth, besides accompanied With all the gifts of nature, ravish'd hence We know not how, in this dissention. Gov. Get you home all, and work; and when I hear You meddle with a weapon any more But those belonging to your Trades, ile lay you Where your best Customers shall hardly find you. Exit Townsmen. I am sorry gentlemen, I troubled you, Being both strangers; by your tongues, and looks, Of worth: To make ye some part of amends If there be any thing in this poor Town Of Barcelona that you would command, Command me. Theo. Sir, this wounded Gentleman, If it might please you, if your pow'r and love Extend so far, I would be glad to wish Might be remov'd into the Town for cure: The Gallyes stay not, and his wound I know Cannot endure a voyage. Gov. Sir, he shall, I warrant you: Go call me hither Sirrah, One of my other Servants. Exit 1. attendant. Phil. And besides. The gentleman we lost, Signior Francisco, Shall he be render'd too. Enter a Servant, Rawl: Ashton. Gover. And he Sir too: Go sirrah, bear this ring To Rodorigo, my most noble friend, The Generall of the Gallys: Tell him this. Exit servant: Theo. Now we shall have 'em both. Phil. Blest be thy thoughts For apprehending this: blest be thy breath For utring it. Gover. Come gentlemen, you shall Enter my roof: and I will send for Surgeons, And you shall see your friends here presently. Theo. His name was Markantonio. Gover. I know it, And have sent word so. Phil. Did you not forget Francisco's name? Gover. Nor his: you'ar truly welcome, To talk about it more, were but to say The same word often over: you are welcome. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Secunda. Enter Markantonio, carried. Leocadia following, and the Servant. 2 Soldiers carrying him. Serv. This is the house Sir. Mar. Enter it, I pray you, For I am faint, although I think my wound Be nothing. Soldiers, leave us now: I thank you. 1. Sold. Heaven send you health Sir. Serv. Let me lead you in. Mark. My wounds not in my feet; I shall entreat 'em I hope to bear me so far. Exit. 2. Sold. How seriously these land men fled, when our Generall made a Shot, as if he had been a warning to cal 'em to their Hall. 1. Sold. I cannot blame 'em: What a man have they now in the Town, able to maintain a Tumult, or uphold a matter out Of square if need be: O the quiet hurley burleys that I Have seen in this Town, when we have fought four howrs Together, and not a man amongst us so impertinent or Modest to ask why? but now the pillars that bare Up this blessed Town in that regular debate, and Scambling, are dead, the more's the pity. 2. Sold. Old Ignatio lives still. 1. Sold. Yes, I know him: he will do pretily well at a mans liver: But where is there a man now living in the Town That hath a steady hand, and understands Anotomy Well? if it come to a particular matter of the lungs, Or the spleen, why? alas Ignatio is to seek; are There any such men left as I have known, that Would say they would hit you in this place? is there Ever a good heartist, or a member percer, or a Small-gut man left in the Town, answer Me that. 2. Sold. Masse, I think there be not. 1. Sold. No, I warrant thee. Come, come, 'tis time We were at the Gallys. Exeunt. Enter Governour, Eugenia, Markantonio, Philippo, Theodosia, Leocadia, Attendants. Gover. Sir, you may know by what I said already, You may command my house; but I must beg Pardon to leave you, if the publique businesse Forc'd me not from you, I my self should call it Unmannerly: but good Sir, do you give it A milder name: it shall not be an houre Ere I return. Marc. Sir, I was nere so poor In my own thoughts, as that I want a means To requite this with. Gover. Sir, within this houre. Exit. Marc. This the Lady that I quarrell'd for: O lust, if wounds cannot restrain thy power, Let shame: nor do I feel my hurt at all, Nor is it ought, only I was well beaten: If I pursue it, all the civill world That ever did imagine the content Found in the band of man and wife unbroke, The reverence due to housholds, or the blemish That may be stuck upon posterity Will catch me, bind me, burn upon my forehead, This is the wounded stranger, that receiv'd For charity into a house, attempted: I will not do it. Eug. Sir, how do you now? That you walk off. Marc. Worse Madam, then I was; But it will over. Eug. Sit, and rest a while. Marc. Where are the Surgeons? Eug. Sir, it is their manner, When they have seen the wound especially, The patient being of worth, to go consult, Which they are now at in another room, About the dressing. Marc. Madam, I do feel My self not well. Theo. Alas! Leoc. How do you Sir. Eug. Will you drink waters? Marc. No good Madam, 'tis not So violent upon me; nor I think Any thing dangerous: But yet there are Some things that sit so heavy on my conscience That will perplex my mind, and stop my cure, So that unlesse I utter 'em. A scratch Here on my thumb will kill me: Gentlemen, I pray you leave the room, and come not in Your selves, or any other till I have Open'd my self to this most honour'd Lady. Phil. We will not. Theo. O blest! he will discover now His love to me. Leoc. Now he will tell the Lady Our Contract. Exit. Eug. I do beleeve he will confesse to me The wrong he did a Lady in the streets; But I forgive him. Marc. Madam, I perceive My self grow worse and worse. Eug. Shall I call back your friends? Marc. O no; but ere I do impart What burthens me so sore, let me entreat you, (For there is no trust in these Surgeons) To look upon my wound; it is perhaps My last request: But tell me truly too, That must be in: how far you do imagine Ir will have pow'r upon me. Eug. Sir, I will. Marc. For heavens sake, softly: oh, I must needs lay My head down easily, whilst you do it. Eug. Do Sir, 'Tis but an ordinary blow; a child Of mine has had a greater, and been well; Are you faint hearted? Mar. Oh. Eug. Why do you sigh? There is no danger in the world in this; I wonder it should make a man sit down; What do you mean, why do you kisse my breasts? Lift up your head, your wound, may well endure it. Mar. O Madam, may I not expresse affection, Dying-affection too I fear, to those That do me favors, such as this of yours. Eug. If you mean so, 'tis well; but what's the busines Lies on your conscience? Mar. I will tell you Madam. Eug. Tel me, and laugh? Mar. But I wil tel you true Though I do laugh, I know as well as you My wound is nothing, nor the power of earth Could lay a wound upon me, in your presence, That I could feel; But I do laugh to think How covertly, how far beyond the reach Of men, and wisemen too, we shal deceive 'em, Whilst they imagine I am talking here With that short breath I have, ready to swound At every full point; you my ghostly Mother To hear my sad confession, you and I Will on that bed within, prepar'd for me, Debate the matter privately. Eug. Forbear, Thou wert but now as welcome to this house As certain cures to sick men, and just now This sodain alteration makes thee look Like plagues come to infect it; if thou knewst How loathsom thou wilt be, thou wouldst intreat These walls, or postes to help thee to a hurt, Past thy dissimulation. Mar. Gentle Madam Cal 'em not in? Eug. I will not yee, this place I know to be within the reach of tongue, And ears, thou canst not force me; therefore hear me What I will tell thee quickly, thou art born To end some way more disesteem'd then this, Or which is worse, to dye of this hurt yet, Come gentlemen. Enter Leocadia. Mar. Good Modam. Eug. Gentlemen. Leoc. Madam how is't? is Mark-antonio well? Methinks your looks are alter'd, and I see A strange distemper in you. Eug. I am wrought By that dissembling man, that fellow worth Nothing but kicking. Enter Philippo, and Theodosia. Leo. Gentle Madam speak To me alone, let not them understand His fault, he wil repent it I dare swear. Eug. Ile tell it you in private. Phil. Mark-antonio, How do you? Mar. Stand further off I pray you Give me some ayre. Theo. Good Brother, wil he scape, The Surgeons say there is no danger. Phil. Scape? No doubt he wil. Leo. Alas wil he not leave This trying all; Madam, I do beseech you Let me but speak to him, you and these by, And I dare almost promise you to make him Shew himself truly sorrowful to you, besides a story I shal open to you, Not put in so good words but in it self So full of chance, that you wil easily Forgive my tediousnesse, and be wel pleas'd With that so much afflicts me. Eug. Good Sir do. Leo. And I desire no interruption Of speech may trouble me, till I have said What I wil quickly do. Theo. What wil she say? Eug. Come gentlemen, I pray you lend your ears, And keep your voyces. Leo. Signior Mark-antonio How do you? Mar. Oh the Surgeons. Leoc. Let me tel you Who know as wel as you, you do dissemble, It is no time to do so; leave the thoughts Of this vain world, forget your flesh and blood, And make your spirit an untroubled way To passe to what it ought. Mar. You'r not in earnest? Why I can walk Sir, and am wel. Leoc. 'Tis true That you can walk, and do beleeve you'r wel: It is the nature, as your Surgeons say Of these wounds, for a man to go, and talk, Nay merrily, till his last hour, his minute: For heaven sake sir, sit down again. Mar. Alas Where are the Surgeons? Leoc. Sir, they will not come, If they should dresse you, you would dye they say Ere one told twenty; trouble not your mind, Keep your head warm, and do not stir you body, And you may live an hour. Mar. Oh heavens, an hour? Alas, it is to little to remember But half the wrongs that I have done; how short Then for contrition, and how least of all For satisfaction? Leo. But you desire To satisfie. Mar. Heaven knows I do. Leo. Then know That I am he, or she, or what you will Most wrong'd by you; your Leocadia, I know you must remember me. Mar. Oh heaven! Leo. That lost her friends, that lost her fathers house, That lost her fame, in loosing of her Sex, With these strange garments, there is no excuse To hinder me, it is within your power To give me satisfaction; you have time Left in this little peece of life to do it: Therefore I charge you for your conscience sake, And for our fame, which I would fain have live When both of us are dead; to celebrate That Contract; which you have both seal'd and sworn Yet ere you dye, which must be hastily Heaven knows. Mar. Alas, the sting of conscience To death-ward for our faults; draw neerer all And hear what I unhappy man shal say; First Madam I desire your pardon; next (I feel my spirits fail me) Gentlemen Let me shake hands with you, and let's be friends, For I have done wrong upon wrong so thick I know not where, that every man methinks should be mine enemy; Forgive me both. Lastly 'tis true (oh I do feel the power Of death seize on me) that I was contracted By seal and oath to Leocadia; (I must speak fast, because I fear my life Will else be shorter then my speech would be) But 'tis impossible to satisfie You Leocadia, but by repentance, Though I can dyingly, and boldly say I know not your dishonor, yet that was Your vertue, and not mine, you know it wel; But herein lies th'impossibility, O Theodosia, Theodosia I was betroth'd to Theodosia Before I ever saw thee; heaven forgive me She is my wife this half hour whilst I live. Theo. That's I, that's I, I'me Theodosia, Hear me a litle now, who have not suffer'd Disgrace at all methinks, since you confess What I so long have sought for, here is with me Philippo too, my Brother. Mar. I am glad; All happiness to him; Come let me kiss thee Beg pardon of that Maid for my offence, And let me further, with a dying breath Tell in thine ear, the rest of my desires. Eug. I am afraid they wil all four turn women If we hold longer talk. Leoc. Alas there is No hope for me; that's Theodosia And that her Brother, I am only sorry I was beholding to 'em; I will search Over the world, as carelesse of my fortunes, As they of me, till I can meet a curse To make these almost-killing sorrows worse. Exit. Theo. Sir, as I live she ly'd, only to draw A just confession from you, which she hath A happy one for me, ask of this Lady, Ask of my Brother. Eug. Sir, she did dissemble, Your wound is nothing. Phil. Leocadia's gone. Exit. Theo. Rise up, and stir your self, 'tis but amazement And your imagination that afflicts you, Look you Sir now. Mar. I think 'tis so indeed. Theo. The Surgeons do not come, because they swear It needs no dressing. Eug. You shal talk with 'em Within, for your own fancy. Mar. Where's your Brother And Leocadia? Eug. Within Belike. Mar. I feel my self methinks as well as ever. Eug. Keep then your mind so too; I do forgive The fault you did to me; But here is one Must not be wrong'd hereafter. Mar. Neither shall shee When I make jests of oathes again, or make My lust play with religion, when I leave To keep true joyes for her, and yet within My self true sorrow for my passed deeds May I want grace, when I would fain repent, And find a great and sodain punishment.

What cloud can hide thee from my following search If yet thou art a body? sure she hath not Tane any house? she did too late leave one Where all humanity of a place receiv'd her, And would (if she had stayd) have help'd to right The wrong her fortune did her; yet she must Be inter'd somewhere, or be found, no street, Lane, passage, corner, turn, hath scap'd enquiry: If her dispair had ravish'd her to ayre Shee could not yet be rarefied so Enter Incubo. But some of us should meet her? though their eyes Perhaps be leaden, and might turn; mine would Strike out a lightning for her, and divide A mist as thick as ever darknesse was, Nay see her through a quarry; they do lye, Lye grosly that say love is blind; by him, And heaven they lye; he has a sight can pierce Through Ivory as clear as it were horn, And reach his object.

He might ha' kept this now, I had nought to shew for't If he had had the wit t'have gone from's word, These direct men, they are no men of fashion, Talk what you will, this is a very smelt. Exit. ScÃ¦na Tertia. Enter Leonardo with a Surgeon. Leon. Upon your art Sir, and your faith to assist it Shal I beleeve you then his wounds not mortal? Surg. Sir 'tis not worth your question; lesse your fear. Leon. You do restore me Sir, I pray you accept This smal remembrance of a fathers thanks For so assur'd a benefit. Surg. Excuse me. Leon. Sir I can spare it, and must not beleeve But that your fortune may receive't, except You'ld ha'me think you live not by your practise. Surg. I crave your pardon Sir; you teach me manners. Leon. I crave your love and friendship, and require As I have made now, both my self and businesse A portion of your care, you wil but bring me Under the person of a call'd assistant To his next opening, where I may but see him, And utter a few words to him in private, And you will merit me; For I am loth Since here I have not to appear my self, Or to be known unto the Governor, Or make a tumult of my purpose. Surg. Neither I hope wil be your need Sir; I shal bring you Both there, and off again without the hazard. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na Quarta. Enter Philippo, and Leocadia. Phil. Wil you not hear me! Leoc. I have heard so much Wil keep me deaf for ever; No, Mark-antonie After thy sentence, I may hear no more, Thou hast pronounc'd me dead. Phil. Appeal to reason, She will reprieve you from the power of grief, Which rules but in her absence; Hear me say A soveraign message from her, which in duty, And love to your own safety, you ought hear: Why do you strive so? whither would you fly? You cannot wrest your self away from care You may from councel; you may shift your place But not your person; and another Clyme Makes you no other. Leoc. Oh. Phil. For passions sake, (Which I do serve, honor, and love in you) If you will sigh, sigh here; If you would vary A sigh to tears, or out-cry, do it here. No shade, no desart, darknesse, nor the grave Shal be more equal to your thoughts then I, Only but hear me speak. Leoc. What would you say? Phil. That which shall raise your heart, or pul down mine, Quiet your passion, or provoke mine own; We must have both one balsame, or one wound, For know (lov'd fair) since the first providence Made me your rescew, I have read you through, And with a wondring pity, look'd on you, I have observ'd the method of your blood, And waited on it even with sympathy Of a like red, and palenesse in mine own; I knew which blush was angers, which was loves, Which was the eye of sorrow, which of truth; And could distinguish honor from disdain In every change; And you are worth my study: I saw your voluntary misery Sustain'd in travel: A disguised Maid Wearied with seeking: and with finding lost, Neglected, where you hop'd most; or put by; I saw it, and have laid it to my heart, And though it were my Sister, which was righted, Yet being by your wrong, I put off nature, Could not be glad, where I was bound to triumph, My care for you, so drown'd respect of her, Nor did I only apprehend your bonds, But studyed your release: and for that day Have I made up a ransom, brought you health Preservative 'gainst chance, or injury Please you apply it to the grief; my self. Leoc. Humh. Phil. Nay do not think me lesse then such a cure, Antonio was not; And 'tis possible Philippo may succeed: My blood and house Are as deep rooted: and as fairly spread, As Mark-antonio's, and in that, all seek, Fortune hath given him no precedency: As for our thanks to Nature I may burn Incense as much as he; I ever durst Walk with Antonio by the self-same light At any feast, or triumph, and nev'r car'd Which side my Lady or her woman took In their survey; I durst have told my tale too Though his discourse new ended. Leoc. My repulse. Phil. Let not that torture you, which makes me happy Nor think that conscience (fair) which is no shame 'Twas no repulse, I was your dowry rather: For then methought a thousand graces met To make you lovely, and ten thousand stories Of constant vertue, which you then out-reach'd, In one example, did proclaim you rich Nor do I think you wretched, or disgrac'd After this suffring, and do therefore take Advantage of your need; but rather know You are the charge and businesse of those powers, Who, like best Tutors, do inflict hard tasks Upon great Natures, and of noblest hopes; Read trivial lessons, and half lines to sluggs; They that live long and never feel mischance, Spend more then half their age in ignorance. Leoc. 'Tis wel you think so. Phil. You shal think so too, You shal sweet Leocadia, and do so. Leoc. Good Sir no more; you have too fair a shape To play so foul a part in, as the Tempter: Say that I could make peace with fortune, who, Who should absolve me of my vow yet; ha? My Contract made? Phil. Your Contract? Leoc. Yes, my Contract, Am I not his? his wife? Phil. Sweet, nothing lesse. Leoc. I have no name then? Phil. Truly then you have not; How can you be his wife, who was before Anothers husband? Leoc. Oh, though he dispence With his faith given, I cannot with mine. Phil. You do mistake (cleer soul) his precontract Doth annul yours, and you have giv'n no faith That ties you in religion, or humanity, You rather sin against that greater precept, To covet what's anothers; Sweet, you do Beleeve me, who dare not urge dishonest things, Remove that scruple therefore, and but take Your dangers now, into your judgements skale And weigh them with your safeties: Think but whither Now you can go: what you can do to live? How neer you ha' barr'd all Ports to your own succor, Except this one that I here open: Love Should you be left alone, you were a prey To the wild lust of any, who would look Upon this shape like a temptation And think you want the man you personate Would not regard this shift, which love put on As vertue forc'd but covet it like vice; So should you live the slander of each Sex, And be the child of error, and of shame, And which is worse, even Mark-antonie Would be cal'd just, to turn a wanderer off, And Fame report you worthy his contempt; Where if you make new choyce, and setle here There is no further tumult in this flood Each currant keeps his course, and all suspitions Shal return honors: Came you forth a Maid? Go home a Wife? alone? and in disguise? Go home a waited Leocadia: Go home, and by the vertue of that Charm Transform all mischiefs, as you are transform'd; Turn your offended Fathers wrath to wonder, And all his loud grief to a silent welcome: Unfold the Riddles you have made, what say you? Enter Sanchio carried, Alphonso, and Servants. Now is the time; delay is but despair, If you be chang'd, let a kisse tell me so. Leoc. I am: but how, I rather feel then know. Sanc. Come Sir; you are welcome now to Barcellona, Take off my hood. Phil. Who be these? stay, let's view 'em? Alph. 'Twas a long journey: are you not weary Sir? Sanc. Weary? I could have rid it in mine Armour. Leoc. Alas! Phil. What ayl you deer? Leoc. It is my Father. Phil. Your Father: which? Leoc. He that is carried: oh Let us make hence. Phil. For loves sake: good my heart. Leoc. Into some house before he see me. Phil. Deer, Be not thus frighted. Leoc. O his wrath is tempest. Phil. Sweet, take your spirit to you, and stay bee't he, He cannot know you in this habit, and me I'me sure he lesse knows, for he never saw me. Alph. Ha? who is that? my Son Philippo? Phil. Sir. Alp. Why, what make you here? Is this Salamanca? And that your study? ha? nay stay him too, Wee'l see him by his leave. Serv. You must not strive Sir. Alph. No, no, come neer. Sanc. My daughter: Leocadia? Alph. How Sir: your daughter? Sanc. Yes Sir, and as sure As that's your Son: Come hither: what now? run Out o' your sex? breech'd? was't not enough At once to leave thy Father, and thine honor, Unlesse th'hadst quit thy self too. Phil. Sir what fault She can be urg'd off, I must take on me The guilt, and punishment. Sanc. You must Sir: how If you shal not, though you must? I deal not With boys Sir; I, you have a Father here Shal do me right. Alph. Thou art not mad Philippo? Art thou Mark-antonie? Son to Leonardo? Our businesse is to them. Sanc. No, no, no, no, Ile ha' the businesse now: with you, none else, Pray you let's speak, in private: (carry me to him) Your Son's the ravisher Sir, and here I find him: I hope you'l give me cause to think you noble, And do me right, with your sword sir, as becomes One gentleman of honor to another; All this is fair Sir: here's the sea fast by, Upon the sands, we will determine 'Tis that I call you too; let's make no days on't, Ile lead your way; to the seaside Rascals. Phil. Sir I would beseech your stay; he may not follow you. San. No, turn ile kill him here then: Slaves, Rogues, Blocks Why do you not bear me to him? ha' you been Acquainted with my motions, loggs, so long And yet not know to time 'em. Phil. Were you Sir Not impotent. Alph. Hold you your peace Boy. Sanc. Impotent 'Death ile cut his throat first, and then his Fathers. Alph. You must provide you then a sharper razor Then is your tongue, for I not fear your sword. Sanc. 'Heart bear mee to either of 'em. Phil. Pray Sir your patience. Enter Governor and Attendants. Alph. My curse light on thee if thou stay him. Phil. Hold. Gov. Why, what's the matter, Gentlemen, what tumult Is this you raise i'th street? before my door? Know you what 'tis to draw a weapon here. Sanc. Yes, and to use it (bear me up to him, Rogues) Thus, at a Traytors heart. Alph. Truer then thine. Gov. Strike, strike; Some of the people disarm 'em, Kil 'em if they resist. Phil. Nay generous sir Let not your courtesie turn fury now. Gover. Lay hold upon 'em, take away their weapons, I wil be worth an answer, ere we part. Phil. Tis the Governour sir. Alph. I yield my selfe. Sanch. My Sword? what thinkst thou of me? pray thee tell me. 1 Attend. As of a Gentleman. Sanch. No more. 1 Attend. Of worth, And quality. Sanch. And I should quit my Sword There were small worth or quality in that friend; Pray thee learn thou more worth and quality Then to demand it. Gov. Force it I say. 1 Atten. The Governour You heare, commands. Sanch. The Governour shall pardon me. Phil. How, Leocadia gone again? Exit Phil. Sanch. He shall friend I'th point of honour; by his leave, so tell him, His person and authority I acknowledge, And do submit me to it; but my Sword, He shal excuse me, were he fifteen Governours; That and I dwell together, and must yet Till my hands part, assure him. Gov. I say force it. Sanch. Stay, heare me. Hast thou ever read Curanza? Understandst thou honour, Noble Governour? Gov. For that we'l have more fit dispute. Sanch. Your name sir. Gov. You shall know that too: But on colder termes, Your blood and brain are now too hot to take it. Sanch. Force my Sword from me? this is an affront. Gov. Bring 'em away. Sanch. You'l do me reparation. Exeunt. Enter Philippo. Phil. I have for ever lost her, and am lost, And worthily: my tamenesse hath undone me; She's gone hence, asham'd of me: yet I seek her. Will she be ever found to me again, Whom she saw stand so poorly, and dare nothing In her defence, here, when I should have drawn This Sword out like a meteor, and have shot it In both our parents eyes, and left 'em blind Unto their impotent angers? O I am worthy On whom this losse and scorn should light to death Without the pity that should wish me better, Either alive, or in my Epitaph. Enter Leonardo, Marc-Antonio. Leon. Well son, your father is too neere himselfe And hath too much of nature to put off Any affection that belongs to you. I could have onely wishd you had acquainted Her father, whom it equally concerns, Though y'had presum'd on me: it might have open'd An easier gate, and path to both our joyes: For though I am none of those flinty Fathers That when their children do but naturall things, Turn rock and offence streight: yet Marc-antonio, All are not of my quarry. Mar. Tis my feare sir; And if hereafter I should ere abuse So great a piety, it were my malice. Enter Attendants. Atten. We must intreat you Gentlemen to take Another room, the Governour is comming Here, on some businesse. Enter Governour, Sanchio, Alphonso, Attendants. Mar. We will give him way. Sanch. I will have right sir on you; that believe, If there be any Marshals Court in Spaine. Gov. For that sir we shall talke. Sanch. âdoe not slight me, Though I am without a Sword. Gov. Keep to your chaire sir. Sanch. âLet me fall, and hurle my chaire! (slaves) at him. Gov. You are the more temperd man sir: let me intreat Of you the manner how this brawle fell out. Alph. Fell out? I know not how: nor do I care much: But here we came sir to this Town together, Both in one businesse and one wrong, engag'd To seeke one Leonardo an old Genoese, I ha' said enough there; would you more? false father Of a false sonne, cal'd Marc-antonio, Who had stole both our daughters; and which father Conspiring with his sonne in treachery, It seemd, to fly our satisfaction, Was, as we heard, come private to this Town Here to take ship for Italy. Leon. You heard More then was true then: by the feare, or falshood, And though I thought not to reveale my selfe (Pardon my manners in't to you) for some Important reasons; yet being thus character'd And challeng'd, know I dare appeare, and doe To who dares threaten. Mar. I say he is not worthy The name of man, or any honest preface, That dares report or credit such a slander. Doe you sir say it? Alph. Sir, I doe say it. Gov. Hold, Is this your father Signior Marc-antonio? You have ill requited me thus to conceale him From him would honour him, and do him service. Enter Eugenia. Leon. Twas not his fault sir. Eug. Where's my Lord. Gov. Sweet heart. Eug. Know you these Gentlemen? they are all the fathers Unto our friends. Gov. So it appeares my Dove. Sanch. Sir I say nothing: I doe want a Sword, And till I have a Sword I will say nothing. Eug. Good sir command these Gentlemen their Armes; Entreat 'em as your friends, not as your prisoners. Where be their Swords? Gov. Restore each man his weapon. Sanch. It seems thou hast not read Curanza, fellow I must have reparation of honour, As well as this: I finde that wounded. Gov. Sir, I did not know your quality, if I had Tis like I should have done you more respects. Sanch. It is sufficient, by Caranza's rule. Eug. I know it is sir. Sanch. Have you read Caranza Lady? Eug. If you mean him that writ upon the duell, He was my kinsman. Sanch. Lady, then you know By the right noble writings of your kinsman, My honour is as deere to me, as the Kings. Eug. Tis very true sir. Sanch. Therefore I must crave Leave to goe on now with my first dependance. Eug. What ha you more? Gov. None here good Signior. Sanch. I will, refer me to Claranza still. Eug. Nay love, I prethee let me mannage this. With whom is't sir? Sanch. With that false man Alphonso. Eug. Why he has th'advantage sir in legs. Sanch. But I In truth, and hand and heart, and a good Sword. Eug. But how if he will not stand you Sir. Alph. For that, Make it no question Lady, I will sticke My feet in earth down by him, where he dare. Sanch. O would thou wouldst. Alph. Ile do't. Sanch. Let me kisse him. I feare thou wilt not yet. Eug. Why Gentlemen, If you'l proceed according to Curanza, Me thinks an easier way, were too good chaires, So you would be content sir to be bound, 'Cause he is lame, ile fit you with like weapons, Pistols and Ponyards, and ev'n end it. If The difference between you be so mortall. It cannot be tane up. Sanch. Tane up? take off This head first. Alph. Come bind me in a chaire. Eug. Yes, do. Gov. What mean you, Dove. Eug.

Mar. Not I brother. Phil. Brother let's speak with you; you were false unto her. Mar. I was, but have ask'd pardon: why do you urge it? Phil. You were not worthy of her. Mar. May be I was not; But tis not well, you tell me so. Phil. My sister Is not so faire. Mar. It skils not. Phil. Nor so vertuous. Mar. Yes, she must be as vertuous. Phil. I would faineâ Mar. What brother? Phil. Strike you. Mar. I shall not beare strokes, Though I do these strange words. Phil. Will you not kill me? Mar. For what good brother? Phil. Why, for speaking well Of Leocadia. Mar. No indeed. Phil. Nor ill Of Theodosia? Enter Eugenia, Leocadia, Theodosia, and one with two Pistols. Mar. Neither. Phil. Fare you well then. Eug. Nay you shall have as Noble seconds too As ever duellists had; give 'em their weapons: Now St Iago. Sanch. Are they charg'd? Eug. Charg'd sir, I warrant you. Alph. Would they were well discharg'd. Sanch. I like a Sword much better I confesse. Eug. Nay wherefore stay you? shal I mend your mark? Strike one another, thorough these? Phil. My love. Alph. My Theodosia. Sanch. I ha'not the heart. Alph. Nor I. Eug. Why here is a dependance ended. Unbind that Gentleman; come take here to you Your sonnes and daughters, and be friends. A feast Waites you within, is better then your fray: Lovers, take you your own, and all forbeare Under my roofe, either to blush or feare My love, what say you; could Cuzanza himselfe Carry a businesse better? Gov. It is well: All are content I hope, and we well eas'd, If they for whom we have done all this be pleas'd. Exeunt.</field>
