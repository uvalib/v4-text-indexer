      <field name="fulltext">The Scene London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS 1m u s Scena 1m a, Enter Sebastian, Clerimont. Cle: Sebastian perswade me not, J will goe to her and sett open the hospitall of his aches, gouts, palseys, apoplexes; whorson old goat must he be rank at these years. Seb. But he is thy Father, you ought to reverence the name, although the person were never so despicable. Cle: Prithee tell me is there any reason that a thing not able to trusse or untrusse his hose should doat upon a Lady, Hercules at one &amp; twenty could but content: one that (if he hath her) will lay her hand betwixt his garlick kisse &amp; her mouth, &amp; lie at the foot of the bed &amp; salute his toes rather then his lips; Js it to be suffer'd? Seb. Why this should vex me more then you, he is my rivall. Cle: Jf he doth not breath a palsie into her mouth shall shake out all her teeth within this week J'le hang. We shal haue them shortly dance like Virginall jacks: he hath a breath will fetch off all her complexion worse then a seacoal fire: he waits for my Elder Brother home from the University to be his spoakesman, that picture that would be no Jnns of Court man forsooth for fear of rescues of Gentlemen from Serjants. Seb: Protest you wrong him, J haue heard fame loves him, and is loud in his commendations. Cle: For what? Seb: For his gentleman like deÂ«portment cheifly, norÂ» are his other faculties whisper'd. Cle: Gentleman like! what Gentleman like? he ne're kept horse nor hounds their, you might as soon haue gott him to the Gallowes as to the steeling of a dear, 'twas much he would weare a Round crown'd hat or silk stockings, now he is at London you shall haue him in the twelve penny Room at playhouses, n'ere set on the Stage, &amp; her 's his Gentleman like Deportment. Seb: You'r i'th traducing humour and care not whose fame you blast; but faith let me stop your intended journey about your Father, he affords us excellent mirth, and Gentlewomen delight much to converse with him. Cle: Jf your finikin Lady knew but all, shee'd casheir him streight. Seb: Nay Clerimont touch not the Ladies name, my ears must not hear blasphemy against her and be my ears, J know her coldness is such, a chaster, Jove n'ere nourisht in his braine when he was big with Pallas. Cle: Nay she is Minerva is she not? O Loue what a company of Kitchen maydes hast thou Deified? hark thee thou Poeticall Dreamer, hast not thou toucht that peice of Divinity yet? can that ticklish flesh of yours come neer this spirit, and not stand upright, ha? if it can then J'le sweare she breaths pure Vesta. Seb: Why friend J doe not so unwoman her as to repute her without naturall heat: no frozen clime expells this fire; nay where the Sun a stranger is, this heat is known, but friend she hath not ill improv'd her stock Nor added to ye flash of youthfull blood Unnecessary flame; but when nature Js high and active, then she helps it not To the degree unlawfull is: her face Js faire without a Fucus, so her blood Hot without lust. Cle: Prethee then tell me what steame it is brings all these flies, these Sutors, her retinew is more numerous then Hellens or Penelopes; why doth she license revells, plays, and masks? can all this be out of pure loue, pure affection, not a thought, not a spice of the right ingredient; hath her simple fancy no composition? Seb: Her sweet behaviour as a potent charme At once spurs on and bridles our affections So that we dare not lust, dare not but loue. This makes us to express in divers shapes One thing, Observance. Some think to catch her ear Jn a sweet cloze of Musick: J her tast With natures bravery, and tempting meats. A third by masks laies seige unto her eye, And thinks himself the boy that danceth there. All which she makes the trophies of her mind, And tells the Stoick he may admitt Pleasure before him. Cle: But your stage-play hath an insinuation beyond all this: J have gon away sometime an excellent Courtier, sometimes an admirable Souldier, and now and then half a Doctor in Leachery. Seb: 'Tis true; these as the best things are abus'd And few spectators doe behold aright The Authors drift: 'tis a shame but truth. At once, the lively actor feigneth lust And doth infuse it; where the Poet look't Other effects should crown his learned pains, That we by sight of vice in her true dress Like Nero prying in his mothers womb Should hate that loathsome place, &amp; so doth she And conquers vice in his own lists and tents. Cle: O Admirable creature! Seb: Why then do'st envy thy Father her? Cle: What should she doe with him? one that cannot see with four eyes, nor goe with three legs: Mauger my Brothers Rhetorick he shall not haue her; Farewell. Exit. Seb: Thy Brothers Rhetorick? yes J too much fear Jt is thy Brothers Rhetorick not thy Fathers. Nor can J blame him to be taken by those eyes, My self am more then prisoner to: he's young And personable and newly come from books Such as sweet Ovid and Catullus penn'd: Wherein all Schollars studie women long Before they practise; &amp; can read, even To Courtiers lectures of Complements. Besides, the pleasing tales and loue stories They can conveigh to willing ears, are arms More to be fear'd in Cupids tents then gold Or Power; but J must check my stragling tongue. J had almost say'd CÅlia might fall by these And be o'recome by a strong line or sonnett; No, her affection in such levell goes, We know not whether we all win or loose. Exit. Sce: 2. Enter Mr Shallow eating paper, &amp; Hog. Shal: Complements call you them? s'death they haue sent me into the fields six times this day, and trouble my head worse then my Taylors bill. Hog: They trouble your teeth rather, why doe you eat them Mr Shallow. Shal: So, now J haue 'em by heart; O Hog, a pregnant Sow doth not teem with more labour the tith pig then my braine doth these complements. Hog: J wonder you will humour the Ladies so much, methinks your own phrase is not so barbarous. Shal. Truly yet they say it is no trim phrase, it smells of the Countrey abominably they tell me, now how that smells J know not: and what's your best tongue perfume Hog? o your Ladies will talk so sweetly, and sing so sweetly, and doe every thing so sweetly, sure they talk with sugar plums in their mouth; Sirrah, the Lady CÅlia would haue me gather in my mouth, 'twould much abate the broadnesse of my speech she saith, and her sister tells me downright J am an asse, didst thou ever hear an asse speak? Hog: You are the first that J e're heard moue the question: had you been ruld by me that brought you hither you should haue had a Lady by this; but you are obstinate, and now see what comes o'nt: you haue been a Sutor to the Lady CÅlia, how doe you fancy her? Shall Faith very ill, J haue a monstrous bad fancy. Hog: Js she not very reserv'd? Shal: Not for me J fear. Hog: What say you to another Lady? Shall. Who her Sister? hang her, she'l never come to good, 'tis shee that giues me all these Complements. Hog: No, No, a girle of eighteen, one that n'ere pig'd yet, She that J wisht you first to, no jeerer of your qualities, but an humble lowly minded thing, no complementer; one that will doe whats fitting; withdraw a little yonder's your tormenter. Enter Penelope &amp; Delia. and with her the dutifull sweet natur'd peice J haue all this while limn'd out unto you, obserue how respectfull to her Lady she is: you might keep her under as you please. Shall: J but she is no Lady is she? Hog: What can't you make her the Lady of your thoughts and affections, 'tis ordinary now a dayes to create Ladies. Shall: She shall be then my ordinary Ladie, and the rest my Extraordinary. Pen: J wonder where my servant Shallow is? Hog: Mark but with what contempt she names you servant: Shall. Nay she'le talk thus to my face. Hog: Delia hath espy'd us, she knows how to carry her self, J haue instructed her. (Aside) Del: The Gentleman surely is perplext of late with your Complements, he is alwayes biting his nayls. Shall: Jn troth and so J am, and yet J haue them not at my fingers ends. Hog: Mark the others modesty. Pen: O 'tis a soft pated Logger-head. Shal: Mark her nay she's right. Pen: He hath been a conning half a score lines this week. Shal. Nay that's a lye they are a dozen. Pen: J wonder what Countrey this fellow was born in, what aire so grosse could clot a fellows brains thus, J would haue taught a horse more in this space. Hog: Will you be made the Hackney for a female witt to ride on thus? S'life J would kick, wince, and doe any thing rather; come follow me, look big and scurvily on her and since she baffles you out of talk, trie and she can dash you out of countenance, but cast some few smiles upon the other and so goe forth, 'twill vex her more then you think for. Pen: Why doth Hog present his brother Boreas thus blustringly? ha, ha, ha! how like a bag-pipe player he looks. Ex: Hog &amp; Shallow. Del: Madam why doe you loue this clown? or if you doe loue him, why doe you abuse him thus? Pen: Peace foole, thou do'st not know the fashion yet, there is a fashion in wooing as in other things, and this it is to doe all things by contrary's, 'tis poor and kitching like to come to downe right and plaine tearms of Loue, your true Ladies abhor it, fie upon it, upon one meeting, or over a Hogdsen cake to clap up a marriage, and the next day to church, 'tis dull there is no sport in it. Del: What doe you call sport Madam if marriage be not? Pen: The time of wooing goes far beyond it; those are the golden dayes of our command, once wiues and ever servants, no, no, Virgins are the absolute's Monarchs in the world, but that their reign never lasts long; Js it not braue to be call'd Goddesse, Empresse, Queene, Nymph? Lady is the lowest stile, but where are those after the Wedding day? then Sweetheart, or wife are Holiday words, we never hear the former but in an Jrony or scoff. Del: Still J wonder then why you doe so long to be rid of this state you so highly extoll, and loose it to such a Mushrome as this. Pen: That's to much for you to ask; but your Chambermayds must know all; thy Lady wench my Sister is the cause of it; She is the Lure spoils my game quite, the only star forsooth the whole Citty gazes on, and till she is eclipsed by some happy interposition, J may wear a mask, for no body looks after me. alass my drift was to pull off this fool from her, but as yet J haue not mov'd it. Del: This was happyly spoke, and shall goe all to him. (Aside) Pen: He is an excellent subject for an abusive witt to play on, and that J like him for; J should not loose one inch of pride by marrying him, which makes me use him to the word servant betimes, that it may not be a stranger to him hereafter; come this is my sisters day of answer to her Sutors, let us know the conclusion. Exeunt. Sce: 3. Enter CÅlia sola. Was ever Lady more belou'd, and trulier By rare variety of youthfull choice? The cities pride and natures, be my servants, And yet J am a Virgin, Such Gentlemen Better n'ere shone in Saturns golden dayes: Men of the best and first mold, men that haue No fault but only this, that they loue me; Men that could win cold Nuns even from their beads, And keep the sprighfull Porcia from her coals, And cause Lucrece to throw away her knife And even after Tarquin loue a man; And yet J am a Virgin; and what's worse Yet must be so; J know not whom to chuse; Each severall man may claine me as his own, They all deserve me best. Curst CÅlia! Excess of loue others advantage is But losse to thee: would J were less belou'd Some hate to me had been more happy far Then all affection; Unkind Archer! Why dost thou wound them with so just a force And even hand? at least thou mighst haue slackt One shaft, (in the to shoot all well's a fault) Thy best is when one arrow only hitts The destin'd mark, and all the rest fall short; Enter Sr Oliver Youngloue, Antonio. Ant: The servants said she was i'th gallery. Sr Oli: We are almost upon it; J haue espy'd her. CÅl: Well Sutors, CÅlia, shall not wrong your loues Jle not dispose my self, nor giue you just Cause of dislike through my particular choice. No, J will learn (if that we things below) Are made partakers of such hidden arts) Whom you kind fate haue writ in constant letters My certaine husband, him i'le choose, the rest Must like of him whom you approue on best. Sr Oliv. To her againe my Sonne, be not repulst Tell her my bags are infinite, my Loue Exceeding them. CÅl. Her's an encounter comeing; A doating father and a loving Sonne. Sr Oli: Say that J dream on her, &amp; in my sleep Cry out on CÅlia's name. CÅl. Who hath no other way Poor Gentleman to utter his own loue But as his fathers spoksman. Sr Oliv: Say J'me a tough A tough old blade that in my yonger dayes Went to it with discretion and a method; Useing my wife but twice a week as physick. Reflecting with an eye of providence Upon Threescore; &amp; haue reserv'd a stock Of pleasure for these dayes, goe J'le wait here Thy comfortable answer and obserue Her eyes, and looks, and by those Symptomes judge How thou dost win upon her heart and mind. Ant. Best Lady (takeing leaue to thank your vertues For the concealment of my loue) J'me bold To praise that beauty taught me to forgett The piety of a Sonne, and for exchang Enricht me with a nobler reverence, The duty of a Lover. Sr Oli: How he works her? CÅl: Your Father is in presence pray be modest, And offer not upon the slender grounds Of a small secresie to build unto Your self presumptuous hopes. Sr Oliv: She is half wonn; She talks and answers to his amorous tales He hath a plagie flattring tongue, mine own Mine own spawn right, what would J giue to hear Their conference. Ant: Madam, J presume not; Although that louers eyes (like optick glasses) Render all favours bigger, and aboue the True proportion in themselues they haue: Yet trust me Lady somewhat of comfort, Somewhat of hope this silence doth suggest; But that which most doth fortify my cause Js my old Fathers weaknesse, when J behold His frost, and the too many enemies His age doth muster 'gainst his sute in Loue. Sr Oliv: He's at it now in the approovement of my manhood, J must present and shew my self; my shoulders doe not erect with credit; but t'is no matter. (Sr Oliv: walks to &amp; fro) Ant. J can't but dream of victory and success Against so feeble an opposer. Sr Oliv: So, So, she's o'recome, now J'le goe to her; Madam Nay he hath told no lie, J am the man Jn all particulars he said J was, Thanks good Antonio, thanks my sweet boy Learning was well bestowd on thee. CÅl. Sr J must desire your Sonne and you to be my guests to night; pray get young Clerimont to come, he is grown a stranger to us. Sr Oliv: No, No, he sides against me with a friend My Rivall, J shall not laugh if he be here, Let him alone, 'tis a perverse boy to me And he shall find J will not threat but doe. Enter Clerimont disguised like a Captaine with a patch on his eye &amp; a false beard Cler: J am chang'd enough J scarce do know my self, were J among the roaring boys J should deceaue them too; yonder's my Father and Jnnocence my Brother; 'Saue you Lady, J wonder (that old man being so near) you can partake of health. CÅl: The reason Sr? Cler. Out with him doth not his nose tell you why, more aire J beseech you, or call for Juniper; upon my faith he stinks worse then a salt bitch, the common shoar is a spring to him, the Bear garden a perfumers shop; see, see, she begins to faint, good knight hoble further off with your three legs; will you murder the Lady with your obscene lungs? CÅl: Your help's unseasonable Sr, J am sound And in my perfect health. Sr Oliv: Antonio lends thy hand. Ant: My sword Sr. Sr Oliv: No, No, thy hand to hold me up, he hath put me into a palsie, Ã´ J could shake him now. Ant: Pray Sr unhand me. CÅl: Good Sr unsay your words, perhaps you have rail'd against a man J loue; for my sake peace. Cler: Loue? Jle break the bands Lady, alasse if you would haue feavers, aches, gouts, tympanies, coughs, collicks, palsies, &amp; rheums your unfortunate issue; take him: he shall beget all these with a kisse, he will poyson with more dexterity then your Doctoor. Ant: This is unsufferable; patience is here a crime, good father let me chastise his tongue. Sr Oliv: No, no, and Clerimont were here, he should chang a blow or two with him, he is just such a swaggering boy, this, upon my life, is a sworn brother of his. Cler: He got indeed two boyes in his youth, yonder is his eldest, a starvling, diet is cast away upon him; he devoures Books to and yet you see he doth not thrive; and the other (a well timbred Gentleman but for his hereditary infirmities) almost drownd in phlegms and rheums, which hath throwd him upon the Sovereign balm Tobacco; J haue known him void a half tub of his fathers corruption in a morning nay diseases as well as other things are successiue, now consider J pray, if he begat a child of phisick at one and twenty what an increase will threescore and ten make; J should be sorry to see this howse turn'd to an Hospitall to maintaine the lame, and diseases of your own body, for if he beget any thing they must be errors of nature, Dwarfs, Crook-backs or Cripples. Sr Oliv: O Pagan Souldier! Sirrah J will pay you and J come at you, hold me Antonio J shall fall heavily upon him else. Cler: Pay me? you will do more then my Captaine hath done this twelue month then; but J will not take pay for nought, J will discharg the other volley and doe your ears a little more service. CÅl: No more, Jle hear no more. Ant: Good father let your legs suffice you till J haue spoak He will be nought but thunder, if his tongue Haue no controul, a word will silence him And make this Gallant Gallyfoist goe off Even like a potgun. Sr Oliv: J, and he were gon we would rayl with him, J am glad J doe not hear him well, how seasonable is my deafnesse now? and yet his cursed noise hath pierced into the wool, J feel a whizing in my ears. Cler: Jle come neerer to you, nay you must hear; tis my allejeance, as much as in me lies, to see the king haue lusty subjects, and shall he be yours? what service can a piece of this flesh doe his countrey, ha? You are his Sonne, 'twere wisdome in you to haue him Â«to the BaÂ»th and stÂ«ew him he wÂ»ill make an excellent codling, a wife is too violent a hot house for him; Lady if you were sure to bury him within this week, you were somewhat to be excus'd, but alas he will lie bedriden a score of years, and be a dying as long as a cat; h'ele breath the toothach into your mouth with a kisse, and insinuate the palsey into your hand when he shakes it. Now Sr with what charity can you marry one you know your touch is more benumming then a Mandrake too; or you Lady with what reason, that are in hot and youthfull fire can lie with a flake of ice, obdurate ice, whom your warm side is not able to dissolve into a drop of cold water; doe but whip away his staff thus and he falls into his graue, where J'le leave him. Exit Cleri: Sr Oliv: Nay let me lie J can fall no lower now. CÅl: Why, Delia. (speaks as behind the Arras.) Del: Sweet Mr Shallow let me goe, my Lady calls, Shall. Let her call her heart out, thy Lady? &amp; so art thou. Enter Delia. CÅl: Who let this wild man in? Sr Oliv: T'is no matter who let him in, be sure you keep him out O Rogue what a throat he had, a Trumpet wispers in respect of him. Del: He pretended extream businesse to your Ladyship, and desired my absence, or els J had usher'd him in. CÅl: Well make satisfaction in your care of ridding the house of him. Del: He stay'd not here but streight flung into the street. Ant: Which way took he? Del: Towards the Exchang. Sr Oliver: Well, if J die within a twelve month and a day, J'le prosecute him and hang him if there were no more men in Â«the world. Exeunt.Â» Sce: 4. Enter Clerimont. J think J shook him and the house too; how the stallion ambled before me? he hath not us'd his legs so much this 7 years; J've stird his blood more then his Phisick or his wench could; how he followed his staff to the ground, as if his soule had bin in it. Well, J'le to Sebastian As he is going out Antonio enters &amp; spies him &amp; draws his sword. Ant: Turn villaine or thy soule goes out the ignoble way. Cler: How's this? Ant: Draw and that streight My wrath's too just to spend it self in words, Thou art not in my CÅlia's chamber now, And besides that there is no sanctuary. Cler: J will not draw; J haue no quarrell to you, nor haue J injur'd you. Ant: Not injur'd me! Hadst thou a father, mother, sister, nay Hecatombs of kindred would not satisfye; My wrath is like thy tongue that knows no bound. Not injur'd me! draw, or unfenc't J'le kill thee. And rather heap law and dishonour on my self Then thou shouldst scape the justice of my sword. Cler: S' life this is short warning to leaue the world J am not yet provided for heaven, nor know not when J shall. Ant: Are you jeasting? J'le send you grinning thither. (makes at him) Cler: J'le fight. [draws) But know fond youth, there sits upon thy sword Too weak a cause, an old man strives in thee, Jn me a lusty lover. Ant: CÅlia guard me, And arme with a strength as great as my loue. Cler: One word, but one word more, dost thou loue CÅlia? Ant. Witnesse that thrust; guard thee, i'le follow it Cler: Doe and kill thy brother, nay follow it Doe my good Romulus. (undisguises himself) Ant: Brother! that name hath a thousand deaths in't. Cle: My father hath a couple of as good soons as a father would desire to hang; J begin to loue him highly now, he'le proue as fine a torment to him as my self; when will he down on his knees and ask me pardon? hark Brother J look to be thank'd (but not with your sword) for the service J haue done you. Ant. What thanks thou canst expect from dead men, take, such hast thou made me. Cler: This is a fine trick, he thinks he hath wounded me, and for my satisfaction would haue me doe as much for him. Ant: Or if thou think'st J am not kild enough Fulfill the Tyrant, prethee do't againe, And make thy sword as bloody as thy tongue. Cle: O J smell him now, he takes me for his rivall. Ant: Oh what malignant Stars are ours, that damne Our blood to such inauspicable loue Wherein to thrive were incest, to be crost No lesse then paricide. Cler: Hear me Brother! Ant: Wert thou not Brother J could hear thee gladly, Be any thiÂ«ng butÂ» that, my antipathy, Or whatso'ere my nature worse abhors, Thy neernesse makes the separation And unitie divides us. Cler: This suspition Shall joyn us, closer then ever joyn us: J swear by the religion of our blood, And what's aboue thy soul, fair CÅlia. J haue not lookt on her with captiue eyes. Ant: Not loue her? ther's naught else impossible, Nothing aboue thought or aboue faith but that; Thou shouldst haue said thou lou'st her more then health, Thy countrey, parents, king; no oracle Could be more true then that, or more belou'd; But now J know you'r false, not loue her? Cler: Why thou infidell, J'le giue thee a sufficient reason for it, how should J loue her that n'ere lou'd any yet, but lust after all; J cannot confine my self to 1, 2, or 3, J must shift smocks as oft as shirts, and that's twice a week. Ant: And yet you said upon that sword there sat a lusty louer. Cler: Tis true, my old friend Sebastian is thy rivall; J am of his faction, which made me reckon up a few inconveniences of my fathers to your Lady. Ant: For ought J see my hopes stand full as faire And promising as ever his can be; And though J am the latest Sutor, yet J find not any one before me in her loue. She doth dispence with such equalities That justice cannot deal to ev'ry one More pleasing favours. Cler: So they all say, they hang on her just like Leeches, not drop off till they are full of comfortable hopes. Well Brother, and Friend, we are pretty well divided now, how we shall come together no man knows, But if my labour do proue all in vaine Say there's a cloven calvs head without braine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT: 2. Sce. 1. Enter Hog, &amp; Delia. Hog. Protest you play the Lady excellently you out doe Madam CÅlia. Del. He hath e'ne changd me into one with his talk; no salutations but Madam Delia, and dear Lady cast not away your sworn servant; he haunts me like a ghost in every corner; so that to satisfie him J was content to answer to his compellations and giue him leaue to be an asse. Hog: You did well to grant it, for he would take it else, and be a fool in spight of your teeth. Del. This is the first hower of Liberty J haue had since J knew him; last night he fell a sleep with a Lady in his mouth by the kitchen fire, where he lay till morning, and wakeing about Break-fast, as he is of an invincible stomack, he preferd the cooks Larder before his Ladies chamber, and presently after he had buried a tray of dead flesh, his appetite was up for the liueing, and then he puld me worse then a cold Capon. Hog. He is thine own, wench, by my turkey eggs he is. Del. Alass that oath is soon broaken. Hog. Well hen of the game, when you have scraped a fortune out of the dunghill, you'l not envy your Hog a little refin'd dirt to wallow in. Del: No, no, thou shalt swim in golden mires, and J will tip thy snowt with silver, whilst thy head and ears lye sowct in sack. Hog. You may see how J loue honesty more then bribes for J haue rejected 2 dozen of waiting Gentlewomen, that besides consideration in the hand, proferd other feeling. Del: J hope you will be true to me you haue found me none of your hardest dealers. Hog. Yet, one of my Customeres is very importunate. Del. Who prethee? none of our house is it. Hog. No, no, she that sent me the box of Tobacco, J protest she hath had a beer license lying by her in Lavender for the opportunity long since; well, the next draught is hers. Del. Faith pitty her you know not what need there may be. Hog. What makes your Ladies Sutors altogether? Del. Some demurr, some half years vacation from wooing, or such a toy, is agreeing on. Hog. Here is old seiges indeed. Del: And yet this castle must be sakt at last, and one wisely consider, 'twere better yeild at first, then after so much expence of men, time, &amp; money. Hog. Come we will about the project instantly. Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter CÅlia distractedly, Sr Oliver, Antonio, SebastiaÂ«n andÂ» Shallow. CÅl: J am resolvd. Seb: Nay good Lady. CÅl: Witnesse these tears as pure as the weeper is, Jt is no trick forgd to delude your loue But satisfie; for speak what other way Leads to more safe content &amp; J will chuse it. Ant: J know not that, but this J'me sure is dangerous Medea never run a blacker course To purchase Jason. CÅl. Speak; could you good Sr After so many years in wooing spent, Even grown white with Loue, &amp; only lasting Jn expectation (of what you please to stile Your second birth) my wedding day; Could you behold that day, this gentlemans; (Proviso that my choice did make it his.) And not convert to your funerall? You could not: or you Sebastian Who now can not admit with patience My hand in the small scruple of a kisse Should grace another; could you see that hand (And not your own streight on your Rapiers hilt Arm'd to divorce it) giuen, for ever giuen Unto this Gentleman; you could not see it. Shall: Why if he could not let him choose, we can see the way to bed without his eyes. CÅl: Nay mild Antonio, whom patience nurst, (Jf any but his father should prevent him) Would then learn fury first, and be stark mad; You cannot and be men reject the salve That at such distance heals and cures the wound Before it's made: such are those registers And darker Volumes of the higher chancery; Which only learned eyes can read, and hands Guarded by Magick, turn: in them are writ The setled course of us inconstant things; And those occurrents which we still impute To chance and fortune, there haue another stile And are cald providence and fate, 'gainst which 'Tis vaine to fight, unless with Gyants pride And like successe we'le war against the Gods. Shall: Ile streight to his Majesties Hocus Pocus &amp; get what J loue best, and thats this Lady. Sr Oliv. Now must J wait the Devills leasure for a wife? Shall: And in the end haue one and his horns to boot. Ant: This is but just And ought to be layd home unto your sex. Who by much more your nature weaker is The stronger err, and doe presume on that Which should dishearten, your infirmitie. Makeing it still your fault and your excuse. And these, on whom you fix your hearts content What are they? but malignant envious souls, The cheif repiners at the common good Whose leanesse is their neighbors harvest time Which starue to see another fat and plump. Shall: This comes home, J do not like it. Ant: Who haueing at too dear a rate bought skill Of the most subtle Marchant, boast their ware But never count the price they paid for it. Seb: These are your Wizards, these they you resort unto Jf that your foisting hound refuse his plumbs, Or Parott almonds, or if through violence The paint should warp, or peruche chance turn round. How long o Pthius must the Divells set 'Bout these portents? who would haue thought such black And horrid crimes (as these you are about) Had logd in natures fairest tenement, Worse doe not spot the foulest breasts of Moors? Ant: And yet we doat upon this painted dirt, Court it, and call it Angell, when indeed Tombs and the rotten mansions of the dead (Jf we regard only the outward form) Are full as faire and goodly; Farewell loue? Loue? giue it the right attribute, 'tis madness. Cupid get thee hence J will not harbour thee a minute longer, Go fill the breast of fools and lunaticks As long as J haue braine and judgment left There is no empty place for thee: Father Your ear J pray. Shall: Sebastian let us plot, let us plot, you see they joine forces; now if you and J could make any friends to the Divells, we should carry this businesse, think, think man, haue you no acquaintance that way? methinks a Scrivner would be a necessary fellow to imploy, or a hors-courser he would ride poast about it. Seb: No, no, tis dangerous trusting others, you had better goe your self, you are so thin you will passe for a spirit. Sr Oliv: Ha! hast thou lou'd her all this while? you plaid The Orator for me then brauely: J did Alwayes expect some knavery, yes, yes, You haue your Mittimus to goe away. Shall. What think you of this project? J will provide two Conjurours, and two Divells, a Divell &amp; a Conjurer for them, and one Divell and a Conjurer for us, now ours shall fight with theirs which shall obtaine the Lady, and so overcome theirs. Seb: Marry that was well thought of, but how shall you and J agree. Shal: Why she shall make a feast and J will eat with you for her, and then the quarrell will be ended presently. Ant: J dare not trust my ears unto her tongue, Father your blessing. Sr Oliv: My Sonne is going Lady. Shall: And you take them going to the Divell, J'le goe to the Divell with him. CÅl: Am J the cause of your departure Sr? Ant: No, no, J never knew you J, J knew a Lady much in face like you But she was rarely qualified, &amp; had Beauty within, which outshone that without, She was giuen to pride nor self conceit Nor witchcraft, no, you are not she, Farewell J'me sure you are not. Exit. CÅl: Fetch him again or J am gone for ever. Seb: Help, help, the Lady swounds, your hands good Gentlemen, she doth begin to breath againe, lets carry her in and get some comfortable things, your Sonne was too too sharp indeed. Shall: They say women are light, sure tis awake then for they are very heavy asleep. (exeunt. bearing CÅlia) Sce. 3. Enter Clerimont, Antonio. Cler: J say thou shalt be this southsayer, what wilt thou loose a Lady of her wealth &amp; beauty for want of a little Legerdemaine? Ant: Shall J that never yet could faine a tear, Nor mourn when that my Ladies dog was sick, And be as witty as Catullus was Jf that her Sparrow, Ape, or Monkey died To whine out Elegies: or if the fates Where pleas'd to spare the beasts, bring himns of joy, Now turn jugler? O Simplicity! Cler: Hast thou not read the task that loue impos'd Upon the Gods? how Joue did turn a Swan? 'Twere long to tell of Mars in Vulcanes net Not so much tangled as with Venus haire; Of PhÅbus and his sisters lunacy, Those eyes of heaven struck blind with earthly forms And thinking them the brightest stars: O Loue How the world wrong'd thee then to call thee boy, Thou wert a Gyant then, but ever since Hast lost thy strength, and dost degenerate Jnto a dwarf, now, now thou art a boy; How could this fondling else stand out so long Against thy Deity? Ant: Peace, J am changd, Jnto any shape thou'lt shift me, J am any thing But that J am. Cler: Had J lou'd CÅlia J would haue run through all disguise e're this Now a hot Frenchman, then a big limd German, Anon, in an Jtalian dresse, appeare; Next in the Spanish accent, garb, and state Court my Madona; then turn Englishman, And be all these in one; if still she stood out, Last with Mustachoes like a Turbant Turk, J would haue sworn by my Pendant Prophet To make her Empresse of the heathen world, Untill she weary of her womans name Gaue to these arms her self a willing prey But you are for simplicity! Ant: Prethee no more J am transformd, Antonio's fled and gone, Doe J appear like any such poor thing? But as some misterious Oracle, Full of ambiguous riddles; to morrow J'le enquire after some empty house Of certaine privacy, where J'le professe The Mathematicks to the publick ear, But privately some mercenary tongues Shall giue me out to be a cunning man, Which once arriv'd to CÅlia's itching ear No thunder with more swiftnesse doth pursue The place i'ts destin'd to, then her glad soule Will fly unto my house, as to her heav'n. Cler: And for a trumpet for to sound thy name Aboue thy worth, leaue that to me, As they goe out Hog meets them &amp; is staid by Clerimont. Cler: Hog hold thy hand, there's gold for thee, conster me that. Hog: At what time would you haue her Sir? presently after, or before, or against bed time, or ith' morning about cock-crowing. Cler: No, my nimble villaine, my Mercury, J must use your long finger in your other vocation, thou must nim or borrow me 12 spoons from the Lady CÅlia's Cook and reserue them in thy boots till J call them to light; Hog: Jf J am apprehended J shall smoake to be sure. Cler: Credit me J'le saue thee from hanging. Hog: Doe but secure me and the spoons are yours; Cler: Such a buisy night would invite a theif to the gallowes but J'le be your bayle if that you conveigh them neatly and are not caught till J find occasion. Hog: 'Tis no matter for that opportunity. Cler: To be taken shall be thy ransome rogue, what think'st of that? Hog: Marry and that would be worth the seeing. Exeunt. Sce: 4.

Pen: Well we are justly punisht for disdaine Disdaine? alas J n'ere had any to disdaine, No, J bear CÅlia's tortures, she offends And it is J am struck.

Only a spice of my trade Sr to greese you in the fist with, good Sr accept it; J haue a corner of a pasty to would be very proud to haue your hand in't. Ant: Maggots consume thy Pasty and thy self. Thou varnisht swine, thou tub of kitchen stuff, Goe to the Chandlers with thy foggy corps, And make good use of thy ill gotten greese, Be turnd to lights of tenn i'th pound, dost think Dost think to catch me as thou dost thy flies, With scraps and bitts? Cook. Alass Sr, the whole pie is yours; what shall J doe? J am more afraid of him then of a strickt Lent or Emberweek. Ant: Well; J haue pickt a fitting punishment Out of thy fault; Justice example takes From crimes themselves; whereas thy sordid hand Was the cheif actor in this bribery, That very hand shall doe me right; next feast When carrying a Pasty to the board, That very hand (shakeing with fat, and feare) Shall loose its hold, and on thy satten doublett The broaken pie shall belch forth streams of greese And spoil thy velvet hose, after which chance Jn discontent thou wilt drop out of the world; Away; thy spoons in Hog the Pandars boots Are safe; use mercy on the slaue, away: Cook. J thank your worship; and pray excuse this punishment, and i'le pay a dispensation to the poor, and they shall haue all my Ladies almes every Sunday hereafter. Ant: Away J say. Exit. Cler: Why this was like an artist: you haue conjur'd the Cook into such a fear that if his pot doe but boile over, or his pie burn, he streight reflects on you, and belieus every mischance to be a Judgment of your inflicting. Ant: J put a face of anger gainst his guift Which will suggest J am no needy slaue, Whome poverty hath sent unto the arts And Muses to be fed, where thriueing well (Unmindfull of my natiue dunghill) through More sordid and base means J rake up wealth Then e're my parents rags, or crooked pins. Cler: Heir of the Sciences! and full as liberall as they. Ant: J'me sure great shoals of Auditours Will throng my chamber, when the news is spread My school is free, and no mans penny sought, No introduction, nor those crabbed words Of Quartredges, or stipend, to be found Upon the post whereon my bills are fixt. Cler: There is not one in all the town but will Advance his hopes to be a Mercury. Ant: No man regards the minds impediment And inward let, but where the Muses cheap And books not bought, nor Tutor to be paid Hang all Mechanicks, Learning were the trade. Exeunt.</field>

He did, exactly to a silver spoone And cald me Cook to; nay he told me more Then J was glad to hear. CÅl: Nothing about me? Cook. About my self; a Pasty scolding hot All down my Christmas cloths must run A judgment great J can not beare nor shun. CÅl: Yes another sute will saue thy cloths. Cook. O no Madame; nay J feare worse prodigies, for all the eggs J broke for your Ladyships caudle were adle, and the meat upon my fackings doth not drop currantly; the loyns of mutton hardly yeild sufficient to baste 'um, and candles are cheap already: last night J dreamt of nothing but fish; well Hogs face shall pay for this; and yet he bid me haue mercy on the slaue. Enter Penelope. CÅl: O Sister! thou art come in happy time, My joies are grown so great, J can't alone Sustaine them; ease me or J die with mirth.

Cook: Please you Madam J'le saue that labour, plounce but into my Feather tub, and you'l come out a Lady bird streight. Pen: She is transported, you told me CÅlia Jn this excesse of comfort, J had share, Giue me enough; J'le bear as long a part As you'l impose. CÅl: No, J can spare none now; But like an almost famisht creature, think No plenty able to appease the rage Of my huge appetite. Enter Hog. Hog: Now am J to performe a peice of service n'ere a rogue in England would doe but my self; they are dull rascalls, and know indeed how to steale, but with what credit? they dare not stand to it and make good there trade, now J profess my self a theif, which they dare as well be hang'd and doe, and betray my self to the law and gallows, that J may escape both; they are undone if they be once taken, J am undone if J be not taken; this is your sublime roguery. Cook: Madam pray stand aside, now must J haue some trick to draw off this fellows boots which are strapt with silver spoons; friend Hog whither so fast ha? Hog: O J confesse, goodâ S'life J am undone J thought the hand of law had clapt me on the shoulder; O Mr Cook J protest you scar'd me, J cannot endure to be toucht J am so ticklish. Cook: J, but oh you confesse, come confess and be hangd. Hog: Why J said J would confesse, but you put it out of my head, and a cough hath taken me of late J cannot speak without interruption of my lungs. Cook: Nay but confess man. Hog: And to that such a stich in my side, oh, oh, oh my skin crumples and is gather'd togeather closer then your breeches, my sides frizzle like burnt parchment; doe you not perceaue it? Cook: Yes, 'tis all on a rustle as your boots are Hog; but J'le tell you a remedy. Hog: What J pray? Cook: Capring as J doe. Hog: J cannot rise from the ground the stitch has sowd me to it. Cook: Yes, yes, come aloft sir, J protest you haue an excellent shake with your legs, J beleiue you can cut a caper well; sure your spindle shanks or your boots are lin'de with tin? you need no spur, your boots gingle enough; good Hog draw one of them off J'le try if J can match it.

Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter Sebastian. Antonio's gon and with him fled my fears, There is not now a corner of my heart Which pale dispair doth fill, J'me swolne with joy, And now dare venter unto any witch Secure and confident of good successe. To feare, where to account the Gods as blind, And rash disposers of their greatest guifts, To joine the likest pattern to themselues, And natures cunningst piece to such a thing But for his shape you'd take to be a fool; No, they haue got clowds and empty vapours To cozen and delude the embraces Of such Jxions; and for the other T'were madnesse to imagine that now At his departure, and farewell to the earth, Heav'n should prepare such an unseasonable And unbeseeming Remora as a wife Whome our most lusty dayes can but content And for whose sake we wish perpetuall youth, And fear to grow old men; no, the Gods are wise And giue more ear unto his childrens prayers. Who then can challeng CÅlia but my self? J fear no witchcraft; he securely fights Who striues against desertless opposites. Exit. Sce. 3. Enter Antonio, Clerimont, Hog. Ant: Did euer men Take such great pains to be made fools and asses? They shoulder one another, thrust and heaue And all this sweat, and strong contention is Who shall be soonest guld. Cler: O let 'um they'l be angry else; here, here's a help for you a rogue in graine. Ant: May we trust him Brother? Cler: 'Tis he that stole the spoons and with a Spartan patience has been pumpt for't, hast thou not? Hog: 'Tis as they say Sir, most true. Ant: Hog is thy name, is't not? Hog: My name is Hog Sir. Ant: On with these trifles then And that same gown; thou canst not be to rough. Because the beast whose name thou bear'st Js of most subtle sight, J'le make thee spie And Argus in our knavery, thy eyes Like planets must in every corner roue, And if thou canst make firm discovery Of CÅlia, or any of her maids, or Sutors Resorting hither, bring me intelligence. Hog: What fee belongs unto my place Sir? Ant: Not a farthing, We must abandon bribes, our Work is pay. The very businesse is reward enough. Hog: Mr Clerimont! J'le be with your Brother but vpon tryall no enrolling, no binding of me to such a cheap trade, what nothing but my labour for my pains? let's haue somewhat, though it be no more then gallants pay for their cloths, a tester to the Taylors boy. Cler: Here's for thee; be sure Sirrah you work well you are payd before hand. Ant: Goe in unto them; say J am spent with talk And doe desire the witlesse residue They would defer their being made fools untill To morrow. Hog: Must they be entreated to be wise? but Sr how and they will not be perswaded? Ant: Tell them they must be. Exit Hog. Cler: How canst thou satisfie so many heads? Ant: J'le tell thee how; The first thing that J doe J binde them to beleeue before J speak All J shall say; Noe lie so rank but if J utter it Js took for gospell; then J winde my self Jnto their thoughts and get from them the skill They seek from me, and tell them only that Which J read written in their own desires. Enter Hog. Cler: How now, what are they gone? Hog: All but 3, the Ladies Cook that washt me and two Gentlewomen that haue maskt themselues from my intelligence, and they must by all means speak with you. Cler: They are CÅlia and her sister on my life, or some of the wenches of the house, whome the Cook with the relation of your skill, made stark mad till they know their husbands. Ant: Are they maskt dost say? Hog: Hoodwinkt Sr, their heads are in a bag, no Hawks were ever so mewd up. Ant: Usher them in; and brother only now Exit Hog. Your absence will be pleasing. Cler: J'me gone, what J say of CÅlia's sister longing humour's true. Think ont J prethee, if you can driue it well Saue the poor mayd from leading apes in hell. Exit. Enter Penelope in CÅlia's apparell, and CÅlia in hers. Hog. Pen: Did you bid our Caroch man driue his horses from this place and attend us an howre hence? Js this your learned Master Sir? Hog: There is the eight wise man Ladies, none of your upstart Conjurers, that haue a mouse, a squirrill or some such thing or vermin for the lease of their liues upon their souls security; he doth not speak in the Dialect of Hocus Pocus, or peeps through an optick glasse into your purse, no, the prince of the air buzzes answers into his ears; he is full of Pluto, and breaths nothing but riddles, Ã¦nigma's and oracles; now he's in private conference with a Legion, and anon you shall haue such a tempest in the room with the muttering Devills, you'l be afraid of being blown up, but stand your grown fast, J'le tell him your Ladyships expect him. Sir the Lady CÅlia and her Sister J am sure on't J haue talkt the longer with 'um for firm intelligence, besides the Cook that pumpt me for the spoons, promis'd fairer fees for his Lady and her sister then broaken pasty, and desires you to remitt the judgement upon his feast day cloths. Ant: O Ladies pardon me That J doe now abandon all my skill And rather could be proud of ignorance Then these profound endowments: Ã´ horror! What rocks of perill must J run against? Jf CÅlia by my arts discovery Foreknow the secret that her soul must know E're it can purchase one poor minutes rest; J see the rack and torment she endures But dare not help although J pitty her; O seek some other man; enough there bee, Dear Lady, J'le direct you to them, And be more gratefull that you will contemn My pains and skill, then if you doe accept it. CÅl: Unmask sister we are discoverd Through this cloud, yet still say you are CÅlia And speak as if your cause were mine. Pen: O Sir Doe not undoe her more whose griefs so great The addition only of your stern deniall Makes her most miserable, let not these tears The few of all the store poor CÅlia has, These even last drops, Ã´ let not these be lost And beg in vaine. Ant: How chang'd! thrice happy plot That saues the man 'twould ruine and confound, Thus long J haue expected your own selves Weary of this dissembling would tell truth. Why doe you mock me? or think you that you can? Pen: We are undone. CÅl: Let us confesse; and saue the worse half of our fault, our impudence. Ant: Js there such craft in beauty? you'r CÅlia Are you not? and you her sister? you err, Could you imagine he that should diue into The night of all your thoughts, and see through time The strange occurrences of future things Obscure lie in present matters, or unable To judg of what he saw before his face; 'Tis not your mask or vaile is dark enough To hide you from my knowledg, hell it self Js unto me transparent, and the night Clear as noon day; Pen: Sir we confess our fault, Great as your wrath, and pray you would impute it To foolish curiosity, and no mistrust Or doubt of your abilities. CÅl: You know (What if you doe not) our hearts all well as us And are acquainted with our very souls, And those that gaue us them, the Gods; by whom We dare not vainly swear, no harm was meant Or trick to undermine or cozen you, But to confirm our selues, least easinesse, And our to forward fault, credulity; Should in a matter of such consequence Betray us to (what we can't now suspect) Danger and folly. Pen: Now all rocks are gone And quite remou'd by this auspicious fault, Pardon me, that before your absolution J call it happy. CÅl: Look Sir upon the crime As you have made by discovering it, A proof and testimony of your skill, A miracle and a degree to advance Your name aboue the height of popular voice Neerer its own heav'n. Ant: Enough, They are caught enough and now what monstrous lye Though ne're so loud or rank will not goe downe As glib as butter with a Dutchman; well Provide you Ladies; J shall try you both And put you to it; nay cease your reasons, You haue o'recome; a pair so wise and faire, He were not man, nor had a heart of flesh Could hear you and not grant; and though J see The hazard J shall run, and certaine shock Of danger, yet such are your beauties power And souls commanding faces, they at once Sweeten and cause my fears; pray Ladies sit And both of you prepare your hearts for a strange, But welcome guest. CÅl: Jt must be comfort then, Nothing but joy so strange, and nothing can So welcome be; Ant: Jt is; are your breasts ready? Pray try, or they are like imprison'd winds In the too narrow conclaues of the earth That violently rend a passage to their liberty Through the close womb they were bred in. Pen: Expectation, the harbinger of joy; Hath thrust out all my old familiars, And swept my heart clean of a company Of as good thoughts as any Lady would Desire to part withall, there may be better, Worse J'me sure cannot come into their place. Ant: But tell me first what tis you most desire? Come, be not bashfull, you may speak as freely To me as to your midwife, confessor Or Alters. CÅl: Sister you'r spoken to. Pen: An't please you Sir J'le answer for us both, There is not so much difference in our wish, Next to our health, what we most covet is Aâ CÅl: Peace for shame Sister. Ant: J will not press upon your modesty, Let it suffice, J know faire CÅlia's mind, But dare not nominate the man, and point Directly to him shall enjoy her bed; Yet J will so declare, with half an eye Her self shall tell, and certainely perceiue Whom the kind fates declare the blessing to, You haue 3 Suters now of eminence, You had a fourth, unhappy Gentleman! CÅl: Had Sir? J hope J haue so still, or indeed Furies were less accurst then CÅlia, And cruel women when they would torment Their louesick servants will invoke my name Jnstead of Furies, and think it the more Horrid auspice. Ant: Fear not, Antonio liues; (So was his name) but such a kind of life Wisemen would censure death, or whats beyond it Hell; breifly he's not himself nor his own man. CÅl: Mad? and liue J and understand he's mad? Strike me good heauens with a Lunacy And make a reparation of his losse Out of my rifled braine; Pen: Alasse Sister, Jt is not worth the trouble of the Gods Nor would the patient be more wiser for't; Unless you haue a greater quantity Of witt, then any of your Sex beside: Ant: You err in calling Judgments on your self; Though heau'n is arm'd, and Cyclops every day Forg thunderbolts, 'tis not for us to dart And through them as we please; we may duely Deserue a punishment, but yet not choose The whipp we'le suffer, or prescribe the judge How to chastise us; you ask for madnesse; And think you'r witty in demanding losse Of wit, as though that justice wanted brains As well as eyes, and knew not in what coine To pay your losse. CÅl: Tell it, Ã´ tell it Sr J'me upon the rack untill J know my torment, And fear they will be cruel and forgiue me, Come my sentence. Ant: You must be married. Pen: Ha! ha! ha! my sentence to J hope twice told Or Sister if you like not yours, take mine And J'le adventer this. CÅl: Unto what monster? Ant: Just such a monster as my self, so weak So feeble, and despis'd a man as age And care haue made me; how like you this Lady? Will you now chang with Coelia? Pen: Alas, Fate doth admit no change, and in this matter Doth quite cashere all dispensation; She must hold and t'were worse; CÅl: Why Sr J see no such prodigies in wrincled brows Should scare us from old men; doe we run away, Or start when we behold our grandfathers? Doe we not rather flie unto their arms? Tender againe with age; and reverence them As Gods on earth; methinks if that the man You doe assigne me doe so well become His years, and milk white haires as you doe; J could play with his locks, and tell the swans, And Jvory they were jett, compar'd with them; And after their decease perchance might be Thought white againe, then tye his flowing beard Jnto a hundred Loue-knots, and liken them To those we set in aged Saturnes picture: O Sr let me but know the man, and i'le Make him young againe with kisses, and infuse Part of my soul into him at his lips. Ant: T'is pitty to delude her honest heart, J stagger; but yet must not betray my self; Attend dear daughter worthy the bed of kings But destind to unequall nuptialls; He that in years and face resembles me Amognst thy Suters most, on him fates place The blessing of thy marriage bed. CÅl: Thy years? There is but one of all my Suters neer thy Years, old Youngloue is it not? Ant: J, Youngloue's he Or J in vaine haue studied Augurie. CÅl: Antonio, yet this recompence is left Since that thy person and thy wits are fled For ever from thee, since that our loues are crost, J will loue him whom thou dost honour most. Pen: Now Sir what Monster doth remaine for me? Jf it were possible J'de rather make My husband one, then find him so. Ant: No, child The fates haue spun a finer thred for you, Compare them both, thine will appear as silk And hers as cruell; yet there is strang art And curious workmanship in this your thred Which thus J doe untwist; you shall be sped But in anothers name, anothers bed, And she alone confers these joies on thee Whose own contents, those that she giues, should be. And he whose happy error causeth this Shall gladly choose what he would gladly misse. Pen: Sr, you haue rather made a Gordian knot Of this small thred, then any way untide it, Cut it asunder, or the little world You rest on will stand out inviolate. Ant: That must be left unto Sebastians strength He is the Alexander must win that world, Who easily may conquer, where you fight To be o'recome, and losse is your delight. Enter Hog. Hog: More geese Sr; what haue you been preaching to these two all this while? Ant: What feather hast thou got now? Hog: Sprightfull Sebastian craues accesse unto your fatherhood. Ant: Ladies withdraw; unlesse you would be seen by the maine hinge, on which both your fortunes hang. CÅl: Js our Caroch come? Hog: Not yet Madam, but if you please my Master shall fetch him; t'is but a puff and the horses are here, another blast and you'r at home. Ant: J haue a private room, and some slight pictures, which if you please to honour with the sight, my man shall shew them to you. CÅl: We thank you Sir And doe desire none but your self may know Our persons or our businesse. Exeunt. Ant: You'r my charg; And when the way's clear 'ile come and tell you Now Sebastian if thy loue be noble Thou shalt haue faire quarter, but if it stop Unto disloyall sport and beastly end Expect not me, who art not thy own friend.</field>

Ant: And if that CÅlia's name be good; good news. Seb: Were he a Divell and could speak her name He must be good while he is speaking it. Father what e're the news is shall betide me Jf CÅlia's name but season it, 'twill tast Of goodnesse. Ant: Jt doth; her name but nothing else, (Aside) Marvail not how J came to know thee But take it for a proof and testimony Of my deep art, and the huge joies J bring you That J doe know you; they are horrid charms Horrid my Sonn by which our art proceeds, Not fit for every ear; such charms my Sonn Even we are afraid to speak, and furies hear; Words that unsphere the Moon, and still the hiss Of furies snakes; words, worse then they are, We speak them to; with which hells Majesty Would be o'recome, and only can indeed. Seb: J like this fellow wondrous well, he speaks As if he understood the waighty cause He hath in hand, one unto whome study And excessiue pains haue been injurious Tempting him to a spire of art, on which He can nor stand nor fall with any safety No meager slaue made so by want of corn And customers, not lack of sleep and rest, Who if he be imploy'd, for fear his Grannams Recipe should faile looks more hideous And gashtly then the Divell he invokes And is the terribler object of the two; J highly like him; Father if that you can Make me so happy, say that CÅlia's name, (That name by which you did prepare my ear As by the most bewitching prologue to Attend too) say it will loose its self in mine, And chang the cold and frozen style of Virgin, For the warm title of a wife, and reverend Name of a Mother? Ant: Can you beleeue Sir? There's nought but that 'twixt you and happinesse; This night she'le meet you in the amorous game Full of delights, and fuller because stol'n; Can you beleeue. Seb: J cannot, but yet wou'd. Will she that hath so long endurd the seige Of loue, now willingly betray her Virgin Fort n'ere ransacked before. Ant: Will she be happy Sir? You know her traine of Suters still increas And she hath now more then she can content Or answer in the cause they move; which made Her think upon this sudden and quick plot May cut them off; when once the fruit is pluckt T'is vaine to beat the tree; can you beleeue?

Sr Oliv: By no means Sir, J must not hear the name of old, or father, These are words of infamy and reproach, And belong to dying people, that smell Of earth and worms before they are in the graue. Why doe J look like one of these dull things? Hem! quoth Sr Oliver to, don't talk of Father, J'le be your Sonn; old? call me Sonn J say. Ant: Since you will haue it so Sonn speak your mind. Sr Oli: J faith old Father and my mind is good, As good as e're t'was to the old game, Methinks J could be yet a Father, Seb: J, and your mind would doe it; but alasse your Knighthood's no body at it. Sr Oli: J can shake my legs still old Father: Seb: You lie; it is the palsey shakes them.

Seb: Why dost thou laugh? leaue of your grinning, fool; And think upon your sad Catastrophe; You must not gul me thus, you must not villaine, J'le send you to your Divells to augment The number of them, by my good sword J will: Ant: Now J haue laught enough, you shall laugh to Untill you shake your Diaphragme; J gul you! Can you my Sonn so it conceiue of me That doe desire to liue no longer then J'me true to you? 'tis not your sword affrights me That thus am guarded. Seb: Why what guard is here? Ant: Besides my innocence, not any yet, Which shouldst thou dare to violate, a whistle Or a call would bring me legions, put up, Such a black guard thou dar'st not look upon Nor any mortall eye, without astonishment; Put up, and be confirm'd J'me wholy yours, J will make good in each particular The pleasing tale hath stoln into your soul. Seb: You cannot then be true to him, to one you must be false. Ant: True unto both; but not in his conceit Nor as his giddy head interpreteth Must J be understood; he doth corrupt The text with a false glosse, and comment of His ill fancy'd hopes, which J 'tis true did graunt But on condition; the premises once sick The Conclusion must needs die. Seb: Didst thou not say that if the morning saw Her safe she was his wife. Ant: True, J did soe And somewhat more which must enliven you; J sayd if Virgin CÅlia 'till to morrow liue But she resignes that name this night, the morne And she will blush together, wishing So those continued daye might never come. Seb: This night! how neer my joies am J? Ã´ night Never till now to be prefer'd 'fore light. Ant: Heap Sr shall injuries upon my head Unlesse to night you are in CÅlia's bed. Seb: There is but one thing now to raise my joies Unto their highest sphere; couldst thou doe that Nay wouldst thou Father; for what canst thou not? Ant: Sonn whatsoever within mans compasse lies Devoted unto these endeavors, and is Possible, or not of to sawcy a demand J shall perform, J shall by that black lake, Which Joue religiously his oath doth take. Seb: Pardon me first, J ask no common thing My soul is so suspicious and doubtfull; J must haue perfect evidence; J know You can command the spirits with a nod T'usurp what shape you please, &amp; personate The inmost thoughts of them they represent, Let me behold, though with amazed eyes And upright haires the wonder of your art. Ant: Now J am caught; 'tis a hard thing my Sonn. Seb: J know it is your only master peece The mistery of your deep profession, Profoundest craft &amp; secret of your trade Which therefore you refuse to prostitute To every eye, because it tells the truth, And can't so well dissemble the right cause And author of this work, but doth confesse Too plainly you converse with evill spirits And hold intelligence with hell. Ant: J'me blown up, quite nonplust, the Divell a divell can J raise; methinks J hear an officer already at my doors. (Aside) Enter Hog. Hog: Sr the Ladies caroch expect them, shall J say you'r busie and desire their pardon for some occasions, or else you would haue waited on them to the boot. Ant: The Ladies sayst thou?

Well Sonn upon the condition you will be silent And not endanger me with my own praise J am content to satisfie your wish. Seb: J won't so much as in my dream talk of you, Nor in my drink, nor to my whore, where tongues Are licens'd to be irregular, Racks shall not get it from me, nor the Priest. Ant: Stay here but the short time our ceremonies May be performd, which but that 'tis so horrid And of so fearfull and severe a form J would present it streight unto your eyes. Seb: J will: How modest are his actions, free from pride As much as falshood; (Musick sounds ceremoniously) Whence are these ravishing aires? Why doe J ask? can CÅlia's spirit rise Without such harmony? at her request The Sphears a louder Musick yeeld, and graunt Unto our ears their long denyed strains And n'ere are heard againe, but only when They listen unto CÅlia's voice, &amp; mend Their tunes by hers. Enter Antonio, CÅlia, Penelope, aside talking. CÅl: Durst he be so ignoble to admitt Such a lewd thought of me? or hear it spoke Without a combate? Ant: Madam resolue upon't Your Sister's willing, and likes his forwardnesse Jn wanton sports. CÅl: Some Curtezan J think Were fitter faire to cool his itch, Ant: Besides; You are not safe in your owne nuptialls Unlesse Sebastian is fetterd first Jn Vulcanes nett. Pen: Sister make the worst on't, if it proue, a day breaks no squares in nine months; let me alone to work him to my Articles when he hath seald before hand. CÅl: J am content, proceed; Antonio presents CÅlia, and Penelope before Sebastian as spirits Ant: Good Sonn goe farther off, yet farther pray, Upon your perill come no nearer to them, None but that place is sanctuary, and can Protect you. Seb: O pleasing, fearfull Spectacle! Astonishment and wonder doe invade My soul, unequall for this prodigie, How to the life he counterfeits the sweet And pleasant roses in their cheeks? who meeting These, and not knowing the delusion, Would not protest they were the very same? Penelope draws off her ring and offers it to him. See, they acknowledg me, and profer signe Of sweet acceptance. Exit Anton: CÅl: &amp; Penel: O Sebastian Thou didst not liue till now; all the pennance We doe in loue strict school, falls short And is to poor a penniworth for this One minutes purchase; The Musick ceaseth Thus CÅlia's presence alwaies brings delight Nothing but horror doth attend her flight. Enter Antonio. Ant: Son did you mark how every circumstance Proclaim'd you happy, how she drew of her ring? Mark Sir the ring which is the Louers emblem, That signifies your loue shall haue no end, But run in a perpetuall circle, And turne into your selues. Seb: Miracle of Learning! Ant: She did conjure her sisters secresy And help, by those sweet sacraments of loue; Which made me represent them both unto you That you might know each scruple of your comfort, The means, the time, that no place should be left For fond suspition. Seb: J am confident. Ant: O how 'twill tickle you to see your CÅlia Carry the businesse, throwing outward signes Of strang neglect on you, and blessing others With feigned pleasures and adulterate smiles. Seb: J am already ravisht and fled out of my self; Ant: You will be so by bed time, Which being next unto the street, a call Unto the window streight brings downe her sister Who there attends to be your guide, and conduct you To an Elysium of more content Then Poets fancy theirs to be. Seb: No more; What shall J giue thee? J will hear no more. Ant: No bribes; only your prayers that my project thriues. Seb: Pray heaven they doe. Exit Seb: Ant: Antonio prays so to. He's gon, what seas of trouble haue J past? J should recant, but time won't suffer me, J must pursue my fortunes; O Danger How true a Lackey art thou unto Louers! Yet doe the Gods so well dispose of thee They will not vertuous louers shipwrackt see. Enter Hog. Ant: J will be no more troubled. Hog: T' is Mr Shallow. Ant: What need we fear that coxcomb. Hog: Shall J request one boon of you? Ant: Yes; what is't? Hog: Why J would desire you to leaue this Shallow to my handling. Ant: With all my heart, For J must streight put on Antonio's part. Exeunt. Sce. 2. Enter Clerimont Solus. J wonder what humour my old Father's in? he hath thrown away his staff, and hobles very manfully, struts hem's, and doth so encourage himselfe as though he had renewd the rotten house of his life for threescore and one years more; J know not what to impute this suddaine chang unto; pray heav'n my Brother proues right; J doe not like these passions in the old man; his looking glasse which he commanded to be broken for frightning him with his own Jmage is now in good request againe, he is allwayes looking in it, his beard brush ever in his hand, for if he vouchsafe you a word in complement, he presently turns his head, and under colour of spitting brushes his beard into order againe; and now the servants are in a distraction, whither they should first goe for the barber, taylor, or perfumer; all his talk is of his gold rings, which being multiplied upon his fingers, your palsey shakes into sounds and Musick; well J'le among them and see what this means. Enter Sebastian meeting Clerimont. Seb: Friend, opportunely met, how like you me? Am J not like a bridgroom? O Clerimont My head runs round with merriment and joy J'me all over mirth and cheerfulnesse, Dull Melancholy's banisht from my soul, Which is as free and lightsome as if it had Shook of this clog of flesh; J feel it not. Cler: This is excellent, whence are these raptures friend? Seb: Whence? from aboue, below; from heauen, from hell. Cler: J know not what to think of this. Seb: Think upon nine a clock that happy time Think on the twining Jvys, sweet embraces; The shell fish kisses, and gentle murmur That billing Turtles make, think upon me And Paradise, and twenty such fine things. Cler: Whither art thou going now? Seb: To see the rarest sight thou wouldst desire. Cler: What sight? or where to be exhibited? Seb: Thy Father made an asse of, wilt thou goe? And J in triumph riding on his back. Cler: Where? at what place? Seb: At CÅlia's house, she is an Actor to. Cler: And J'le be a spectator. Exeunt. Sce. 3. Enter Hog disguis'd, &amp; Mr Shallow.

Hog: The man was neer kin to me, and for his sake J shall doe you no small courtesie. Shall: To haue done me good, J could haue commanded Hogs blood, or Hogs cheek, Ã´ you know not Hogs tie and mine. Hog: Will you repose some confidence in me; you yet shall haue the Lady; what though CÅlia be dispos'd and her Sister to, yet there is a third the Lady Delia, and she J'me sure wishes you no harm. Shall: Nor J her. faith J was a man in her quarters once, but now am out againe, J know not why but something is come betwixt us J am not so intimate as J was. Hog: Take courage Sr, those faire days shall shine againe, &amp; shortly to. Shall: Don't mock me J am brought low enough already, J am en'e starvd for want of flesh. Hog: My master now is absent, and will be for a time, you shall make use of this his absence, and wear such habitts, J haue a beard and peruch so like there is not a haires difference, be you but thus disguised, and i'le conveigh your Mistress to you; no other house you need goe unto untill it be performd, but lodg in my masters chamber. Shall: O Tom Shallow againe right dayes appear Againe thou shalt be to the Ladies dear, And after midnight with the lasses toss it, Untill thou burst with caudle and sack-posset. Exeunt. Sce. 4. Enter CÅlia, Sr Oliver Youngloue, Penelope, Sebastian &amp; Clerimont rageing. Cler: Why doe you laugh so friend? Seb: Ha! ha! ha! she bears it brauely like her self, she will not look on me but with a frown. Cler: S' death! are they glued together? What hath the rogue my Brother done? J allways fear'd his narrow conscience would not stretch to cheat my Father: J know not whome to curse first; either my Father that hath the good fortune, or my brother that gaue it him, or my self that was the cause he had the power to giue it, or this asse that grins and shews his teeth: Ã´ my eyes, this sight is pinns and needles to me. Sr Oli: O divine Fortuneteller! how true are thy words yet. CÅl: How like you Sir these arms, will they not charm you a sleep sweetly. Seb: There was a bob; pretty little rouge How she doth flout him with her flatteries That bare a double sence, her meaning is, All the delight her arms can bring unto him Js but to charm him into sleep, yes, yes His last, a plaine jeer unto his weaknesse. Mark to how scurvily she looks on me: ha! ha! ha! Pen: Nay J allwaies said the old Knight would carry thee away, thou didst look so grauely. Cler: He must haue better legs then, better brains (Aside) Sebastian hear me but one word pray. Seb: Away, away, what art thou a fool to? Why dost not laugh? J shall not think thee wise Untill thou laugh. Cler: Laugh? what object is there Here of mirth but thy owne self? Seb: Ha! ha! ha! nay nay laugh at me. J am the fool you'l find it in the end. CÅl: To morrow, let to morrow be the day We will no longer loue defer our joies. Sr Oliv: Withall my heart, hem! so, methinks J am As sprightfull now as when J got young Clerimont, What art thou here my boy? J saw thee not. Tell me how lik'st thou thy faire Mother in Law? Cler: She were better be in hell then e're enjoy you Sr. Sr Oli: Ha? what sayst thou? Cler: J like it well you are so neer your joy Sr. Sr Oli: O J belieue thee louing Clerimont, How J was cozen'd in thy disposition J haue a long tale to tell thee will fetch Tears from those eyes, but now we must not weep, Antonio's mad; but J must please my wife. Cler: Yes, J beleeue he is, madder then thou art Or he that simpers yonder at his losse, That sage Philosopher that laughs upon The world which way so e're it goes, fine fool; How it becomes the puppy; well J'le goe And be reveng'd upon Antonio.

Seb: Yes Lady; J shall burst with wonder at her craft Another bob as J liue and palpable; J wonder he doth not understand he's guld, J hope J shall haue you Sir at my wedding; Doth she not tender her own self unto me?
