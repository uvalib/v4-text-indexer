      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Eteocles. Polinices. Creon. Jocasta. Antigone. Guards of Eteocles. Priests. People.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Thebes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Jocasta, Antigone. Joc. Thou only now of my unhappy offspring, Antigone, thou only triest to bring Some consolation to my mortal grief. Yet, notwithstanding, thou dost owe thy life To the incestuous king. Thy qualities Would make one doubt the horrors of thy birth. Mother of Ådipus, and wife of Ådipus, The name of parent only makes me shudder. Yet, when thou call'st me by the name of mother, There is, I know not what, that sooths my soul. Oh, that I dared to call my sons thy brethren! Oh, that I dared my guilty voice to raise To the immortal gods! I would implore That they on my devoted head alone Would hurl the shafts of their unerring vengeance. Ant. Alas! the gods have ceased to pity us The gods themselves abhor us. Ådipus! It is a name that of itself suffices To blast our fated race; we were defiled, Tainted with guilt, ere yet we saw the light! Were reprobated long before our birth ... Mother, why weep'st thou now? When we were born Thou rather shouldst have wept. Didst thou then see Nothing of what the future should bring forth? Brethren at once, and sons, Eteocles And Polinices, yet have scarcely given Proofs of their characters. Joc. To Ådipus They hitherto have shown but little pity; Display'd unnatural hatred towards each other. 'Gainst their flagitious mother, why have they, With better reason, not turn'd all their rage? Inadequate to my enormous guilt, No other punishment have I to bear Than feelings of remorse. I fill the throne, The genial light of Heaven visits these eyes, While Ådipus, unfortunate, yet guiltless, Deprived of sight, covered with infamy, Neglected lies; and e'en his very sons Abandon him; by their means is he thus Constrained to shudder with a double horror, That he of his own brethren is the father. Ant. And dost thou think thy sufferings are light Compared with those of Ådipus? Though he, From grisly caverns, mad with grief and rage, A thousand times a day entreat for death; Although his sight be gone, for ever gone, Quench'd in an everlasting night of tears, Yet less than thee do I account him wretched. He will know nothing of the spectacle, That in this realm will be too soon displayed; Or, if he know, he will not as thou wilt, With his paternal eyes behold th'impure, The impious, and the reprobated remnant Of our devoted race, destroy each other. Between the brethren hate is at its height; And 'twould be difficult to say, if thirst For blood or power most vehemently rages. Joc. I see it ... I? ... the brethren fight? oh, Heaven, I hope to see it never. I alone Am thus enabled to support my life, By the desire which in my breast I feel, The warm desire, and the aspiring hope, To stifle with my tears, that which, alas! 'Twixt my exasperated sons now burns, The fatal flame of discord ... Ant. Dost thou hope it? Oh, mother! one the sceptre is, and two Are the competitors. What can'st thou hope? Joc. That the alternate oath will be observed. Ant. That oath both swore: but one alone has kept it. He from the throne is banished. Swoll'n with pride, Perjured Eteocles now fills that throne, And reaps the harvest of his breach of faith. But Polinices, forced from foreign states Assistance to solicit, to his wrath Will set no bounds, if he the sceptre gain not; And will Eteocles to force concede That sceptre, which, by force, he may retain? Joc. They have a mother ... to my mediation Will not their fury yield? Ah, rob me not Of my last hope! Although, as fame reports, The Argian king advances with his troops To aid the cause of exiled Polinices, And to reclaim his violated rights; And though Eteocles, inflamed with pride, Still obstinately keeps the Theban throne, Yet in my tears, and in my indignation, And in the anguish of a mother's bosom, There is a power to bring them both to reason. My loud reproach Eteocles shall hear For broken faith, and violated oaths; And Polinices shall be told, and tremble, That the same Thebes which he now aims t'assault Witnessed his birth, and was his infant home. What more? If they compel me, they shall hear me Asseverate the opprobrium of their birth, And swear that ere their swords attack each other, Those swords shall find a passage through my breast. Ant. Alas! If I a hope could entertain 'Twould be in him that's banished from the throne: His was the milder nature; nor his heart Can by long exile be so much depraved, As is his brother's by long use of power. Joc. Thou deem'st most highly of the exiled brother? Yet has Eteocles, as he has done, The bounds of filial duty not transgress'd; Without my leave not form'd a strange alliance; Nor had recourse to the enemies of Thebes. Ant. He has not had, oh mother, to endure Long exile, perilous adversity, And broken compacts. Soon, too soon, oh mother! Whose is the better nature we shall witness. SCENE THE SECOND. Eteocles, Jocasta, Antigone. Ete. Behold, at last, that Polinices comes; He comes, who so exclusively engrosses A mother's partial, fond solicitude. Not as he went from Thebes shalt thou behold him, Alone, an exile, and a wanderer; Not as he saw me on that day return To claim from him the covenanted throne. He returns to us with a proud array Of powerful enemies: in arms he seeks From his own brother the ancestral sceptre: Anxious and ready he displays himself To burn to ashes these paternal walls, These sacred temples, and these household gods, This palace, in which, first, the breath of life, An infant, he inhaled; this, that contains His father, and his mother, and his brethren, And all that he should hold most dear and sacred. He hath thus sacrilegiously referred All law, all hope, all reason, to the sword. Joc. Then true is the report? Oh, Heavens, in arms To his paternal soil! Ete. He has forsworn The Theban name; he is become an Argive. To him his daughter hath Adrastes given, And he will give him Thebes. From yon high tower, If thou art disposed to see it, go, and witness How he hath trodden down his native soil. Thou wilt from thence, e'en on our lands, behold His gaudy banners floating on the breeze, And, with arm'd strangers, see the outstretched plain, As by a bursting torrent, overwhelmed. Joc. Have I not often told thee, that to this By dint of force thou drov'st him? ... Ete. Of my brother The first assailant thou shalt not behold me: I only shall secure the walls of Thebes. Ant. He quarrels not with Thebes. He seeks alone To gain by arms a throne to prayers denied. Ete. Commands, they were not prayers. Opprobrious, Unjust commands, which I refused to obey. And I, assuredly not used to obedience, Possess the throne. Since he will have it so, Himself absolves me from the plighted faith. The abominable tie that he has formed With the enemies of Thebes, has, of itself, All antecedent covenants dissolved. Joc. He is my son, in spite of what he has done. Such I esteem him; and moreover hope To make him yet esteem thee as a brother. I mean forthwith his fury to confront, And meet him on the plain. Meantime do thou ... SCENE THE THIRD. Creon, Eteocles, Jocasta, Antigone. Cre. Whither, oh sister, dost thou bend thy steps? The paths are intercepted; and the gates Of Thebes are closed 'gainst the besieging foes. The walls with armed men on every side Encompass'd; horrid sight! Before the rest, A bow-shot from the troops, comes Polinices Towards the city gates, all unattended. The vizor of his helmet raised, he spreads Towards us one powerless hand, and with the other Bends towards the earth the point of his drawn sword. With gesture such as this, audaciously Admission for himself, and not for others, Within the walls of Thebes he challenges; Invokes his mother's name, and makes profession Of an impatient wish to ask her blessing. Ete. This is a new wish truly! with drawn swords T'invoke the embrace of an offended mother. Joc. But didst thou not, oh Creon, first exhort him His arms to lay aside? My inmost mind Is known to thee. Full well thou art assured I could not see, much less embrace a son, Who comes with sword in hand to brave his brother. Cre. His words breathe nothing but respect and peace. Nor do his troops with military license Run through our fields: From the resounding bow The barbed arrow has not hissed through air; Nor has an Argive weapon tasted yet A drop of Theban blood. On their swords' hilt Their right hands rest immoveable; each warrior Is sway'd by Polinices; thou might'st hear A confused murmur through the camp, which cries, âPeace to the Thebans, and to Thebes.â Ete. Indeed! This most assuredly will be to you An honourable peace. Does then my brother 'Gainst me alone this enterprise prepare? 'Tis well: and I alone accept the challenge. Ant. But, notwithstanding, if he speak of peace, Let us first hear him ... Joc. Let him be admitted Alone within the gates: I will speak with him; Nor can'st thou interdict it. Cre. If he bring No treacherous influence with himâbut I fearâ Ant. His soul's a stranger to the arts of treason. Ete. Truly thou know'st him well! It seems to me That thou art acquainted with his inmost mind. Perhaps you concur in thoughts as well as words. Joc. Alas! my son, how in these bitter accents Thy malice ill-disguised breaks forth! To Thebes, Ah, let him come, and come to my embrace; There lay his weapons down. Let us, meanwhile, Go to the temple, and implore for peace. And did he ask for me? Beloved son, 'Tis a long time since I beheld thee last! In me alone perhaps; in my immense, Impartial, and maternal love, has he, E'en more than in his troops, reposed his hope. He is indeed my son; he is thy brother: Betwixt you I alone am arbitress. For a few moments banish from thy mind The thoughts of how he has returned to Thebes; Remember only how he went from thence; How many years, in spite of thy pledged faith, Through Greece he wandered: contemplate in him A prince, a suffering exile, and thy brother. SCENE THE FOURTH. Eteocles, Creon. Ete. With menaces this Polinices hopes To bring me to submission, and degrade me? What boldness! To my palace unattended He comes, as if to mock me! Perhaps he deems That all is gain'd when he appears in person? Cre. All this I apprehended from the day That, in the name of Polinices, came, Claiming the covenanted Theban throne, The bold Tideus. The fierce menaces, The contumelious carriage, which he join'd To the request, sufficiently convinced me Of Polinices' sinister designs. He feigned pretexts whence he might snatch from thee The common throne for ever. 'Tis now clear He wishes for it never to restore it: Cost what it may he wishes for it now; E'en though the impious path that leads to it Were with the last drop of thy blood defiled. Ete. Assuredly, he now will be compelled To drink that blood e'en to the latest drop: For my existence and my throne are one. Shall I indeed become the willing subject, And swear allegiance to a hated brother? Hated indeed; but still more scorned than hated. I, who now see none equal to myself? I should be vile, if from that altitude I could a moment e'en in thought descend. From the throne's height a king should never fall But with the throne itself. He cannot find, Except beneath its venerable ruins, A worthy sepulchre, a worthy death. Cre. I see, oh king, with exultation, see, In thee, the lofty valour live again Of thy magnanimous progenitors. By thee the name of son of Ådipus, Clear'd of all stain, will reassume its lustre. A conquering monarch, to posterity No other recollection shall he leave Than that of his atchievements. Ete. But, alas! I have not conquered yet. Cre. Thou art deceived; Already, by not fearing, thou hast conquer'd. Ete. What avails flattery? I am so beset, That, amid war's vicissitudes, to me Nothing is left secure, except my courage; Nothing is left to hope, except revenge. Cre. Thou hitherto art king: I first here swear, For all thy subjects, for myself, to thee Inviolable faith. Rather than serve Thy hated brother, we will all here spend To the last drop our life-blood. On the traitor, Should impious fortune smile, he shall alone Reign o'er the ashes of what once was Thebes. But, perhaps, if pity for thy faithful subjects Influence thy breast, thou wilt retract thy purpose Of open war. Ah, let him only perish Who plots against thy life! thy safety wills it, And more than this, the safety of the state. A brother's death may to a brother seem Perhaps too cruel; but ferocious war, Protracted war, can that indeed appear Less cruel to a sovereign? less unjust? Ete. What do I wish for else, or what else hope, To what do I more ardently aspire, Than to oppose my brother man to man? This hatred is commensurate with my life, And its indulgence more than life I prize. Cre. Thy life? Dost thou not know it? That is ours. 'Tis true, that valour cannot find a seat More noble than the bosom of a king: But oughtest thou t'oppose to treason's wiles An open valour? Is he not a traitor? What brings him now to Thebes? With sword in hand, Why should he speak of peace? Or why invoke His mother? Perhaps he comes here to seduce her? His impious sister is already his. Truly great plots are hatching. Wilt thou not Defeat such fraudulent contrivances? Ete. Ah, doubt it not! if long he tarry here 'Twill be to his misfortune. If he live, To flight he'll be indebted for his life: I would not trust his death to other hands. To mine alone 'tis due. And say, what rage, Like mine, will penetrate that stubborn breast? Cre. Ah! to secure a more consummate vengeance, Suspend awhile thy too impatient hate. Ete. The means most fatal, fierce, and manifest, Alone please me. Cre. Yet perhaps thou wilt be forced T'adopt the most conceal'd ... Thy brother comes Powerful in arms. Ete. Thebes also has her warriors. Cre. Yet has Adrastes many more: The war Too unexpectedly comes on us. Ah! We can but die fighting beneath thy banners. Ete. But why speak I of warriors? I am one, One also is my brother. Cre. Dost thou hope To defy him? His mother, sister, all, ... Around him flocking ... Ete. But my trusty sword, Cannot it clear a passage to his person? Cre. And with the effort thou wouldst lose thy fame. Such an excess would be condemned in Thebes. Ete. And does not Thebes blame fraud? Cre. That fraud would be From all concealed, or partially discovered. And if a king appear not criminal, It is enough ... Thy brother was th'aggressor ... Do thou, by management, make him appear Still to continue such ... Ete. What management? I understand thee not. Cre. Upon myself I take the whole affair: Repose in me: And listen only to my counsel. Thou In time shalt know it all. First it behoves us To make him trust to simulated peace. Do thou so well this stratagem confirm, That he, without the Argives, may consent To tarry here in Thebes. Then 'twill be easy To make the traitor treacherously perish. Ete. Provided that he perish, and I reign, A little longer I'll constrain myself To keep my hatred and my fury pent Within my bosom. Cre. I will circulate With art the cry of peace; to peace proposed Do thou consent with a well-feign'd reluctance: 'Twill be thy interest to-day to cheat Both friends and foes alike. But, above all, From the solicitous bosom of thy mother Be e'en the shadow of suspicion banished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Jocasta, Creon. Cre. Ah, put an end to thy perpetual tears! This day, that seemed the harbinger of slaughter, Will not, perhaps, be finished, ere we see Thebes blest with lasting peace. I have inspired Within the bosom of Eteocles Such horror of this sacrilegious war, That, in his mind, he almost has resolved To re-establish violated faith; Provided that his brother can convert His menaces to prayers. Joc. Yes, yes, to-day The brothers' enmity will have an end; But what will be that end? It is recorded By the stern fates, and only known to Heaven. Ah, with thy flatteries may the event agree! This is my only hope before I die! ... Thou couldst, then, somewhat to pacific thoughts Soften the stern mind of Eteocles? I will believe thee. But, there yet remains Th'embitter'd bosom of my exiled son To sooth. I will shed tears; for now, alas! I can do little more: I will exhaust Threats and entreaties; but thou knowest well That I am not, as others are, a mother; Nor reason warrants that I should expect That filial reverence which I merit not. Cre. Must I again entreat thee to be calm? Desires for concord, more sincere, were never Witnessed amid such warlike preparations, Behold Eteocles; ah, consummate, By pious art, the peaceful dispositions, To which, already, I have wrought his soul! SCENE THE SECOND. Jocasta, Eteocles. Joc. The day is come, oh son, in which both thou And Polinices, in a mother's presence, Your cause dispassionately must arbitrate. Nature betwixt you constitutes me judge. I, more than any one, can make thy heart Thrill with the mention of a brother's name, That sacred name which thou no more regardest. Ete. Does he regard it better than myself? He is a brother, as he is a citizen; A brother, as he is a son and subject: His various duties he fulfils alike. Joc. Each duty, least of all a subject's duty, Does it become thee now t'enumerate? Thy oath expressly makes thee now his vassal; Yet I behold the king. Thou shudderest, In hearing me proclaim thee subject? Say, Ah say, is it a more illustrious title That of a perjured king? Ete. A king despised, Ah, is not that a title more offensive? What but his arms emancipate me now From my pledged oath? I swore without constraint, Without constraint will I perform my promise. How can I ever redemand with boldness That ill-defended throne, which I have yielded From abjectness of temper? Joc. Thy stern pride, Thy courage, are sufficiently notorious; Establish now thy character for justice. Make not towards thy brother, I conjure thee, An ostentation of ferocious virtue! Rather be generous, pious, and humane; No other virtues does a mother wish To witness in a son: perhaps they seem Virtues to thee not worthy of a king? Ete. Not worthy, no, if they from terror spring. Brief my discourse shall be: if he can do it, He, in thy presence, shall his reasons give For his proceedings. Mother, thou shalt see That I've a royal soul; and that I hold My honour dearer than my life and kingdom. SCENE THE THIRD. Polinices, Jocasta, Eteocles. Joc. Oh thou, my long and vainly-wished-for son! Do I again behold thy face in Thebes? ... At last to my maternal breast I clasp thee. How much I've wept for thee! Art thou become More placable? Didst thou invoke thy mother? Behold her in thy presence! Dost thou come Submissively to lay down in her presence The horrid burthen of fraternal discord? Ah! tell me, com'st thou hither to console me, Or to cut short my few declining years? Pol. Oh, were I, mother, as I wish to be, The soother of thy griefs! But, I am such, That, wheresoe'er I go, I bear with me The anger of the gods. Already, mother, I must have cost thee too, too many tears. Joc. Ah, no! we will shed tears, but not of grief. Advance, and hasten to embrace thy brother! He is my son, and dear to me as thou art: Speak to him kindly if thou love thy mother; Give him thy right-hand; press him to thy bosom. Ete. Whither advancest? Warrior, who art thou? Those arms I do not recognise. Perchance, Art thou my brother? No, it cannot be; For helmet, buckler, sword, and javelin, Are not th'accoutrements with which a brother A brother comes to meet. Pol. And who but thou Put in my hand these instruments of war? The day that Tydeus, in a brother's name, Came to these thresholds to demand my kingdom, Say, did he in his right-hand bring the sword, Or peaceful olive branch? 'Tis true, by day He was admitted to a conference; But on the night of his departure hence A plot was laid insidiously to kill him; And he had fallen a victim to the snare Had he not been invincible! Thus warned By what befell my messenger, I learn, That, here, grave questions are by arms decided. Joc. Ah, say not so: hast thou not here a mother? And since thou hast one, art thou undefended? Behold thy buckler, 'tis my breast; that form, That in one day to both of you gave birth: Ah, throw away thy other useless weapons; They interfere with our embrace; and say, Silently say, that thou'rt by foes encompass'd. Ete. Do not expect from me the pledge of peace, If first thou do not manifest thy purpose; If first thou do not make us understand, Why thou, a subject and a citizen, Dar'st, as invader, to return to Thebes. Pol. My right, to him who measures right by force, I ill could tell, if force did not attend me. Greece knows my story; dost thou know it not? I'll tell it thee: thou'st reign'd, but reign'st no longer. Ete. Fool! thou shalt know whether I reign or not. Pol. Thou hitherto hast had the name and sceptre, But not the fame and honour of a monarch. I, who am free from perjury, surrendered, After the year's illapse, to thee my throne: Didst thou not swear to do the same? I kept My oath; do thou keep thine. I come to claim My heritage; a brother, if thou yield it; But thou shalt find in me, if thou refuse it, A foe, fierce, cruel, and implacable. Thus have I told to thee, without disguise, My resolution. In my righteous cause, Earth and the sky proclaim themselves. The sky, Already witness of our mutual oaths, Will, I believe it, favour this my sword, And will the perjured punish. Ete. The just gods Whom thou invokest thy misdeeds to second, Abhor fraternal arms: of their revenge, A signal instance he will be who first Ventured to grasp them. Pol. Dar'st thou to recall, Perfidious wretch, the tie of brotherhood? Feel'st thou a horror at it, now that thou First to fraternal war compellest me? But art thou not the same that didst not feel Horror at perjury? These impious arms, The violator of his faith first grasp'd them. The war is thine; its guilt is thine alone. Joc. Ferocious souls, is this your hoped-for peace? Ah, hear me, I entreat you ... Ete. I am king, And sit upon the throne; and here proclaim, That while Adrastes, and his hated Argives, Encompass Thebes, I listen to no terms Of reconciliation, nor endure Thee in my royal presence. Pol. And I, To thee, who dost usurp the throne, reply, Thyself a king miscalling; yes, I here Reply, that till thou hast fulfill'd thy oath, The Argives here shall stay, and I with them. Ete. Mother, thou hearest him; the recompense That for his guilt he asks. Why parley further? What dost thou here? Depart from Thebes this instant! Pol. Thou shalt again behold me in this place, But in another guise: to impious foes Th'inevitable messenger of death. Joc. Ye only are the impious! Quickly punish, Of being mother to such impious sons, The fault in me! Plunge, plunge in me that sword; My blood too is connatural with yours. Rivals in guilt, ye sons of Ådipus, Of crime the offspring, and to crime impell'd By the implacable, avenging furies, Here, here, your weapons hurl; behold my womb, The chamber of your infamous conception. Be not the brother slain, but slain by you The mother; 'twere a far more venial crime, And far more worthy of your ravening swords. Ete. Hold'st thou unjust the terms that I demanded? Pol. Hold'st thou my want of confidence unfounded? Joc. And is it then my wrath that is unjust? Thou'rt not enraged at the demanded sceptre, But that it is by one in arms demanded? And for no other cause thou wear'st these weapons, But to obtain thy sceptre for the year? Let one resign his sword, the other quit The sceptre not his own; and if, betwixt you, I pledge myself as surety for th'observance, In future, of the covenanted oath, Who will refuse obedience? ... Ete. I will not. Mother, thou will'st it? I will therefore pardon The outrage 'gainst myself and Thebes committed. Let him first yield; he was the first t'assault us. Soon as our fields are clear'd from yonder troops, He shall be king. I yield to him the throne. He shall not take it from me. Can he take it, While that my veins retain a drop of blood? Do thou decide: thou see'st in me compliance: But, if between us both the peace is broken, Remember thou'rt alone the guilty cause; And may the horrors of disastrous war Fall, where alone they should fall, on thy head. SCENE THE FOURTH. Jocasta, Polinices. Pol. And may thy imprecation be accomplished, May Heaven shower vengeance on my head, if I Am not sincere in my desire for peace. Joc. Beloved son, and may I trust thy words? Pol. Mother, I wish to spare the Theban blood, No wish is dearer to my heart: like me, Adrastes fain would sheathe the murderous sword. 'Tis true, that, till he saw me in this Thebes, The ancestral sceptre grasp, he would refuse, Although I wished it, to return to Argos. Joc. Alas! thou wilt not be the first to yield. Pol. I cannot. Joc. What prevents thee? Pol. Prudence, mother. Joc. Dost thou not trust in me? Pol. I trust him not: He has deceived me once. Joc. If thou refuse To free this city from besieging foes, I shall believe what fame reports of thee, That thou hast form'd, our ruin to ensure, Infamous ties of blood with King Adrastes; And that thou hast demanded of thy father War, as the fatal dowry of thy marriage. Pol. Oh cruel fate! my infant, and my spouse, On one side emulously rend my heart, Weeping, and asking bitterly from me, Their wrested heritage; on th'other side, For thee, my mother, deep compassion thrills me, And for my sick and desolated country; ... Yet, ah reflect! Thou seest it thyself; What would it now avail if I sent back My warriors? 'twould not be less manifest, That if my brother yields, he yields to fear, And not to my just claims. What will he then Have gain'd for his proud honour? Well I know, That far from hence my force withdrawn he wishes, Since force alone compels him to be just. Joc. And thou alone adoptest force, because It loosens thee from every other pact. Pol. Mother! dost thou so little know thy sons? Thou know'st full well that we were scarcely born, Ere hatred, towards me, in his heart took root. He grew in hatred; and in every vein Hatred is mingled with his blood. 'Tis true, I love him not; for 'tis impossible Hate to return with love: but I wish not To injure him; so that I do not seem To bear his scorn, and Greece behold me not Tamely enduring outrages so vast. Joc. Hear virtue! Thou expectest Greece to prize thee, Since to a brother, guiltier than thyself, Thou dost refuse to yield? The Theban throne, Of all thy wishes, is the noble object? Dost thou not know that here to gain the throne, Is to gain all that is on earth most wretched? Think on thy ancestors, who ever reigned In Thebes, and was not guilty! Certainly, The throne on which sat wretched Ådipus Is worthy of thy envy! Dost thou fear That the world should not know that he had sons? Say, hast thou virtue? Leave the throne to guilt. Wouldst thou take vengeance on thy brother? wouldst thou That he, by Thebes, by Greece, the world, and Heaven, Be execrated? Leave him then to reign. Even I, also born upon the throne, Disastrous days, amid its empty pomps, Days of distraction, each obscurer state The object of my envy, have dragged on! What other art thou, misadventurous throne, What other, but an ancient usurpation, Source of much suffering, and of more abhorrence! Oh, that I ne'er had fill'd thee, fatal station! Of Ådipus, then had I never been The mother and the wife; then had I not Been the cursed parent of unnatural brothers! Pol. Mother, thou mortally offendest me! Deem'st me unfit for my appointed station? Ah! it is not, no, it is not my object T'impose as laws each transient phantasy, With hypocritical and insane pride T'affect resemblance to th'immortal gods; The puppetry of super-human greatness, Though this, by many, may be deemed to reign, Is not my object. If in happier days Virtue in me was not a vain pretence, Now, in my adverse ones, be thou assured I hold it still more dear. A throne in Argos Adrastes offered me; if I had loved A sceptre, for itself, I there had reigned. Joc. Thou rather, than t'obtain a throne, oh son, Be anxious to deserve one. I still hope That thou wilt have one: yet if both of us Eteocles deceive, I pray thee, tell me, Whose is the infamy, and whose the glory? Yield to my reasons, to my prayers, and tears; Yield to the tears of thy unhappy country. Wouldst thou destroy Thebes ere thou reign'st in Thebes? Pol. I have already said it, war I wish not: But force assists t'obtain more certain peace. Joc. Lov'st thou thy mother? Pol. Far more than myself! Joc. My life is in thy hands. SCENE THE FIFTH. Creon, Jocasta, Polinices. Joc. Ah, Creon comes! Complete my conquest over Polinices ... I haste to use my influence with his brother. Which of you two will yield? Thou wilt, my son, If thou rememberest that on thee alone Thy mother's life, the fate of Thebes, depends. SCENE THE SIXTH. Polinices, Creon. Cre. Ah, wretched mother! how I pity her! Little she knows her sons. Yet she might be Happy, perchance, if it on thee depended. Dost thou then yield? Trustest thou to thy brother? Pol. I have on nothing yet resolved: 'tis true, It wounds my soul to hear myself proclaim'd An enemy in Thebes; it wounds my soul To be the author of fraternal strife; What ought I now to do? Cre. To reign. Pol. The throne Can I have here without the loss of blood? Cre. E'en from the cradle as a son I loved thee: I always saw in thee the better nature; When 'twixt you both your mother hesitated, How often have I made her notice it! Oh, Polinices! I have not the heart Now to deceive thee. No, thou wilt not reign Here without spilling blood. Pol. Oh, Heaven! Cre. But thou May'st chuse: it doth depend on thee alone, Little to shed, or much. Pol. What do I hear? This, from the first, was what I chiefly feared. I only, then, have choice of error left. No, it shall never be, no never: I Will never violate, by shedding blood, So many, and such sanctimonious ties, Come, what come may: by means iniquitous I will not prosecute a righteous cause. Adrastes shall return again to Argos; Alone, and powerless, I will stay in Thebes. Cre. Thou art most virtuous, as I always thought thee. Much I commend thy words; but can I let thee Chuse what will ruin both thyself and us? Pol. Is then that ruin certain? Cre. Dost thou know Thy brother? Pol. Yes, I know him: he hates me Much as he loves the throne, and more: but yet, I think, or are they flatteries of my fancy, That, in despite of him, with generous treatment, I might constrain him to a generous conduct. Shame can work wonders; we shall have to-day, My mother, Thebes, the Argive king, the world, As witnesses between us. Cre. Had he not The gods before as witnesses? what say'st thou? His mother, and the gods, the Argive king, Thebes, and the world, he impiously scorns. I am constrain'd to speak without disguise. In Thebes, with iron hand, a perjured king The sceptre grasps; by all his subjects hated: If terror had not watched in his defence, He long ago had lost his throne and life. Thou art the last hope of the Theban people. That day in which thy milder character Ascends once more the hereditary throne, The oppressed multitude will deem the day Of its deliverance ... Where is now our hope? That day will ne'er arrive. Pol. Will ne'er arrive? This, this, shall be the day. Cre. Perhaps 'twill be this ... Ah, day eventful! Prince unfortunate! Another now usurps that throne from thee ... Nor while his life remains wilt thou regain it. Ah, trust me, that he even now ascribes Thy wish for it to guilt! Pol. What a new flame Of rage thou kindlest in me, when, at last, After long struggles with myself, I seemed Surmounting past revenge! Cre. Erewhile the king Swore, and I heard him, that he would not live Except upon the throne. Pol. To perjury He is accustomed, and, on this occasion, He shall be perjured; I dare promise thee. Wretch, thou shalt live, but not upon the throne! Cre. Thy hope for this is vain. There is no way The throne to reascend, if thou resolve not To trample on the body of thy brother. Pol. Cease; thou distractest me! Shall I embrue My hands with blood fraternal? The dire thought Appals me ... Impious and fatal crown, Art thou of so much worth, that thou deservest With turpitude like this to be procured? Cre. If he would take away thy crown alone, That were excusable; but to such height In him unnatural hate and rage have risen, That, life for life, thou art constrain'd by force To give it, or to take it ... Pol. I wish not To spill his blood. Cre. Wilt thou then give him thine? Pol. Though here I stay alone, Heaven and my sword, My courage, stay with me; nor will it be To him an easy task to take my life. Cre. Valourâhow can that cope with subtle fraud? Here dost thou look for open opposition? Pol. Then treachery is prepared for me! Oh, speak; Reveal it to me ... Cre. Heavens! what shall I do? Yet, if I speak, and thou preventest not The consequence, I fall the tyrant's victim, And thouâthou art not safe. Pol. The apprehension Of treachery suffices not to make me An impious traitor. Speak; there may be means By which I may be saved; or, if I fall, That I may fall alone. Cre. Thou hast not yet The art of perjury learned. Dar'st thou to me Thy sacred faith to pledge a horrid secret To keep, that I prepare to tell thee now? Pol. Yes; by my mother's life I swear to keep it. Thou know'st that life is sacred to me: speak. Cre. But we are in the palace ... an abode Too perilous for us ... perhaps here already Too much at length to thee I've spoken ... Hence To some securer spot. Pol. Is there in Thebes A place exempted from the tyrant's influence? Cre. 'Tis meet that, with profoundest caution, we Elude his subtle wariness. From hence A secret path, and long disused, descends Towards the temple ... Let us seek this path; There I will tell thee all. Pol. I follow thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Eteocles, Creon. Ete. Hast thou seen Polinices? Dost thou think That he hates me as much as I hate him? Ah, no! in this, as well as other things, I do surpass him quite. Cre. With hating thee He is not satisfied; he feels for thee The bitterest contempt. He hath already Swerved from his purpose. Loudly he asserts, That he will have, as witnesses in Thebes Of this fraternal peace, his friends from Argos; In my opinion 'tis to insult thee more. Nor shall we see them from our gates depart, Till thou, a wandering exile, leav'st this city. Thou seest that now, for one, there doth remain But a brief moment to forestall the other; He who is most supine shall fall the victim. 'Tis now most evident, that he, by force, Challenges thy refusal. O'er thy head The fatal sword is now suspended; thou, Wilt thou not give the signal to unsheathe it? To thee 'twas hitherto alone expedient, But to thy safety indispensable His death is now become. Ete. May I, at last, To my revenge, for which so long I've sighed, And to my hate and rage, succeed to give A consummation speedy and secure. When he is dead, a valour in the camp Will I display proportioned to the cause. Adrastes, prosecute the siege of Thebes, And thou shalt quickly see, that in the fight I can atone for treason in the palace. Cre. The Argives, trusting to the truce, secure Within the camp repose; 'twould be most easy To make a dreadful carnage, if on them Thou shouldst fall unawares. With their alarm A dreadful doubt would mingle; they would know Nothing of Polinices. Ete. Sayst thou nothing? They should know all, and of another kind Should be their apprehension. To the Argives The traitor's head shall be display'd on high; Lugubrious symbol to our foes alone Of portent ominous; but, to ourselves, The presage, and the pledge, of victory's palm. Cre. Then do not be importunate with him To send the hostile troops again to Argos. Thou wouldst augment, and vainly, his suspicions: And should he yield, which is not probable, It would be detrimental to thy cause. Adrastes would have scarcely left his post, Than, afterwards, in hearing of the death Given to his son-in-law in Thebes, more fierce He, his avenger, would return; to blood, To fire, and the exterminating sword, Devoting all the ill-defended realm. King, thou hast chosen well! With one hand give Correction to the traitor, with the other, At one fierce onset, unexpectedly Bring on thy foes, war, fear, confusion, ruin. Ete. A ruin most complete, since least expected. Do thou prepare for war while I feign peace. But see, my mother comes: let us retire; If ever there was need to shun her presence This is the moment ... Cre. Let us both avoid her. SCENE THE SECOND. Jocasta, Antigone. Joc. Ah, see! He shuns my sight; still hesitates To trust his mother! Ant. An usurper fears Whoe'er he meets. Joc. Since he beheld his brother, He has most carefully our presence shunn'd: To what must I impute it? Ant. Canst thou doubt? In his dissembling breast he cherishes Hatred and rancour, blood and fell revenge. Joc. Thou put'st on all his deeds a foul construction. Were not the terms that he demanded fair? And if to-day the invading brother yields, As almost he has pledged himself to do it, To my entreaties, and the voice of reason, I do not see with what pretence the king Can palliate his violated faith. Ant. To him pretences never will be wanting For violated faith. 'Tis vain to hope For peace, if Polinices does not yield The throne for ever to Eteocles. It cannot be concealed, the throne alone Can somewhat mitigate the atrocious cast Of his ambitious nature. He esteems That throne the dearest portion of himself, A second life. Joc. And yet his accents prove, That more he values than the throne, that honour That gives the throne its lustre: to be brief, 'Twas Polinices that did menace first. Ant. He was the first offended. Did a heart, That was invincible, e'er gain the power, The sense to smother of unworthy insults? Full of revenge, but of a noble kind, Proudly does Polinices from his lips Pour forth his indignation; mute his brother; Muteâyet around him, I, at all times, see A train immense of counsellors, from whom, 'Tis certain, that he never will imbibe Impressions high, or generous. Here, alas! There are enough of those degraded wretches Who love themselves alone; to whom the name Of country is unknown; who, at the thought, Shudder, and freeze with terror, that a king May mount the throne who loves the cause of virtue. Nor fear they without reason; they would drag Their days in heaviness beneath the sway Of such a monarch. I affirm it, mother, And do thou heed th'assertion, to this peace So much desired, the evanescent rage Of Polinices, of Eteocles The more inveterate and deeper hate, Are not invincible impediments: No; the invincible impediment Rather arises from the insidious wiles Of scycophants, whose element is falsehood. SCENE THE THIRD. Jocasta, Antigone, Polinices. Joc. My son, I hope in thee, in thee alone! Thy mother, Thebes, thy sister, whom thou lovest, And who so much loves thee, with real peace Wilt thou make all these happy? Is it true? Speak, I entreat thee. Art thou not of sons, Of brothers, and of citizens, the best? Say, has Adrastes on return resolved? Pol. Does, then, Eteocles from Thebes depart? Joc. What do I hear? to our confusion then, And to thy shame, must I for ever hear thee Deny us peace? or not the first consent to it? Alas! thy brother will too surely go! Too surely, as thou wentest, go to exile: By Heaven I am condemned, and by my sons, To everlasting tears! they ne'er will cease! Feed'st thou, my son, on my maternal tears? Ah say, were not thy words erewhile all peace? Pol. Alas! they're farther now from peace than ever! Thou must not ask of me the cause: but yet There does exist for this a cause so horrid That I can never tell it thee. Thou wilt, Ere long, discover it thyself; a chill, A mortal chill, through all thy bones will rush When thou dost hear it. More I cannot say, Than that Adrastes does not leave these walls; No, he departs not. Soon, in spite of me, The lofty walls of perjured Thebes laid low, May yield him entrance mid their broken fragments: But let the evil come to him who courts it. Perhaps, in the sanguinary contest, I May also find a tomb; nor shall it grieve me, Provided that I fall not unavenged. Joc. Alas! on whom dost thou thus thirst for vengeance? Pol. Upon a traitor. Joc. He the traitor is, Who, thus, flagitiously, with fabled plots, Cherish'd in thee this impious doubt and rage: Believe me only ... Ant. Mother, brother, hear! ... Trust only my alarm. Joc. Say'st thou alarm? Speak; what alarm hast thou? Ant. Eteocles Has Creon for his counsellor; and thence A reasonable terror ... Joc. Creon? Pol. Creon? Ah, were it only he that counsels him! ... I am too well versed to be duped by this ... Creon ... had it not been for him ... ah, perhaps To impious revenge ... Joc. What do I hear? What broken sentences! what bursts of anger! What secret weighs upon thy bosom? Speak ... Pol. I cannot speak. As I can now be speechless, Oh that I could forget, or ne'er have known, The abominable secret! 'Twould have been More fortunate for all; a single crime Had then sufficed; 'twere better to have died Betrayed, than thus revenged. And yet to know it, And to be passive, is impossible. Oh, what a deluge I behold of blood! What slaughter! Of his friendship what a proof! What fatal proof to me has Creon given! Ant. Yes, brother! now indeed I pity thee. What didst thou say? The harbinger of death Is the dire friendship of the impious Creon! Joc. 'Tis true, till now, of Polinices' claims He never seemed the advocate. But what Must I infer from this? Daughter, dar'st thou? ... Pol. E'en more than others are, of my just cause, And of myself, is Creon advocate. Ant. Creon betrays you all; I swear he does: Of all of ye he makes a sport, and he But tampers with you to complete your ruin. Joc. Where learn'd'st thou such harsh judgments? whence so bold? Creon's my brother! these his nephews! would he ... Ant. Too long have I been silent; and e'en now I do not speak at random. Of that Creon, Who is thy brother, Emon is the son. He knows his father; he himself inform'd me; Why should I waste more words? I swear again He hates you both: to the contested throne Creon aspires; and what atrocity Is there, that clears a passage to the throne, That is not learned in Thebes? Joc. I scarce believe it ... And yet who knows? This, this alone was wanting To all our other horrors! Pol. Where have I Entered incautiously? What labyrinth Of unexampled perfidy! My foes, My most atrocious foes, I here am doomed Among my kindred to enumerate! But you, to whom I listen, you, that now I see in friendly semblance round me stand, How can I know if in your breasts there dwell Or faith or treachery? How can I know If you are not in thought my enemies? Thou art my mother, and my sister thou; What avails this? Such names, 'tis true, are sacred; But in this Thebes such names are too portentous. Do not I call th'usurper brother? call Creon my uncle? Inauspicious palace, Where to the hated light my eyes I opened! The vile confederates thy walls contain Are all, all of my blood! and I, perchance, The laughing stock of all! Exiled so long, I find myself a stranger in my palace: Where'er I turn my apprehensive look I see a traitor. All life's charities Are banished hence! What do I seek in Thebes? What do I hope? or why remain I here? What death is there more horrible than life Dragg'd on with you in comfortless suspicion? Yes, yes, I feel it, at my birth, ye furies, Ye only did preside; over my life Ye, ye, preside alone: to what distress, To what foul stain, do you reserve my life? ... Perhaps from Avernus ye alone repel me, Ye dire Eumenides, since I am yet Not quite so impious as Ådipus! Joc. Oh, thou, of Ådipus the worthy son, Dost thou accuse of treachery thy mother? Dar'st thou invoke the furies of thy birth? Pol. What other gods should be invoked in Thebes? Joc. Son ... Ant. Brother ... Pol. Argos is my fittest home. Faith still is kept in Argos: there I live Secure from foes, and never hear the names Of brother and of son. Joc. Return to Argos; Fly; return quickly; or in Thebes confide Alone in those who flatter to betray thee. Pol. With equal safety I confide in Thebes On those who love, and those who hate my person. Oh, cruel doubt, whence I in terror live, And scarcely trust myself! I have no throne, Yet all a monarch's perturbations feel; Guilty suspicion; and degrading terror; And all the insane impotence of rage! Oh, horrid movements, of my heart unworthy, Which I, till now, ne'er knew! why do I feel Your sway omnipotent, and omnipresent? In Thebes there is a more consummate tyrant: For you his bosom is a fitter dwelling; Tear him to pieces: let him not taste peace Amid his many crimes; that peace, of which I'm so unjustly robbed. Ant. Ah, calm thyself; Listen to me: thy wretched mother's heart Thou piercest with thy words. We both love thee, As son and brother ne'er were loved before. Joc. Compose thyself; thy most unjust suspicions Fain would I not remember. Thou shouldst hide Nothing from me; speak, my beloved son! Ah, be constrained by pity for thy mother! The horrible secret, pent up in thy breast, Tell it, and perhaps ... Pol. Oh, mother! ... I have sworn To keep it, and my faith's inviolate; Before I forfeit that, ah, let me perish! It may appear in Thebes excess of virtue, Such it seems not to me; my own applause Is dear to me, and not the applause of Thebes. Joc. Keep then thy oath, since it involves my death! Fulfil thy vows! Give me a thousand deaths, And leave in doubt the palpitating heart Of a most wretched mother! She knows not Which son in danger, which in safety, lives; Keep'st thou from her the means of saving both? Ant. More than thy oath, inviolably sacred, And far more ancient, are the ties of nature. Pol. Who first infringed them? Joc. If, by breach of oath, Thou canst save blood, and frustrate treacherous deeds, The heavens absolve the compact. Pol. Why should I Seek to protect the life-blood of a traitor? Let it be shed, but in the field. Deceit Let the deceiver use, it well becomes him. But a short time remains to weave new frauds. Ant. Oh, brother, thou didst love me once; but if That love no longer second my entreaties, I do conjure thee by thy wife, beloved Far more than we are; by thy little child, Whom thou with tears didst name; ah, cast from thee, I do conjure thee, every thought of vengeance! Say, wouldst thou thy hereditary throne With foulest crimes and blood contaminate? Blood, which is not thy own, thou canst not shed In Thebes. Joc. Accumulated vengeance falls Upon thy head in Thebes; thy footsteps turn From the dread precipice which yawns before thee. Thou yet hast time to do it: if thou be (Which I believe not) by Eteocles Ensnared, each plot which thou to me revealest, Thou, by that deed, dost frustrate; dost forestall All the necessity for fell revenge. Beloved son, whate'er the crime may be, It cannot, by a brother's death, be cancell'd. Pol. Why didst thou make me brother to this traitor? Joc. And why wilt thou in wickedness surpass him? Pol. Thou tearest my heart asunder ... wouldst thou hear? Perhaps 'tis a lie ... perhaps a double treachery ... Perhaps ... what can one here believe? ... farewell. Joc. Stay, stay! Ant. See, Creon comes. SCENE THE FOURTH. Creon, Jocasta, Antigone, Polinices. Joc. Deliver me From a tremendous, horrible suspicion ... Ah, say ... Can it be so? Cre. Transport and peace, A lasting peace I bring you. Dry your tears; Oh ladies, Polinices is our king. I hasten first to yield a subject's homage. Pol. Ah, may the omen be propitious to me: Who, more than thou, wishes to see me reign? Joc. Dost thou speak truth? Cre. Banish suspicion hence; I from the court have all suspicion driven. Eteocles is changed. Pol. Eteocles Is changed! ... and is it Creon tells me so? Cre. The plot is hushed at present. In a whisper to Polinices. It is true, That my persuasions were inadequate To make him yield, had there not been to these More cogent reasons joined. Each warrior Murmurs in Thebes; and, for a perjured king, Reluctantly equips himself for battle. The universal backwardness compels him; This he allows not; but who does not see it? He's conquered by necessity, yet chuses, By lofty phrase, to hide it from the world. Joc. I have heard thee speak of him in different terms. Cre. Thou heard'st me to the king, in flattering speech, Strive to adorn the truth; this I deny not: But does he ever, with sincerity, Permit me to address him? Oh, severe And despicable servitude! And yet, Had I not flattered him, more banefully Others had done the business. Yet, behold, To win him to his duty, not a little Does it conspire, that I had heretofore Made his heart captive. In a little time He will convene you here; it is his will That all the people, and the mitred priests, The altars of the gods, the deed should witness. Hence, he himself, in ceremonial pomp, Will lead thee to the throne ... Joc. Am I permitted Hopes to indulge like these? It cannot be! Fallacious hope a thousand times hath flattered, A thousand times deceived me. Cre. What, I pray, Dost thou now fear? to consummate the deed The rite alone is wanting. I confess, That, if I trusted to his virtue only, I might have apprehensions; but I place In his well-grounded fears my confidence. Of th'alienated Thebans, he has not Either the hearts or hands: he will, however, Affect the merit to bestow on thee That sceptre, which the murmurs of the people Snatch from his grasp; in that alone indulge him. Pol. I will. Ant. Ah, pause awhile. Within my breast I feel a horrid presage ... Pol. Instantly Hither we will return. Joc. I also tremble. Ant. Ah, wretched me! Pol. I do not, cannot tremble. My right is just: The gods are on my side. If they withdraw themselves, I have my sword.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Eteocles, Jocasta, Polinices, Antigone, Priests, People, Soldiers. Joc. Ye gods! if this be the propitious day Of wished-for peace, ah, let it be my last. 'Twould be too great presumption to expect Others like this hereafter to arise; This is the summit of my warmest hopes ... But where is Creon? Ete. He will soon be here. If now thou fear, thou wilt offend me, mother; No less than thine is my desire for peace; Since thus I purchase it, and to obtain it Surrender thus my kingdom. Unconstrain'd I yield; forcibly not taken from me, Albeit the injurious rumour will be spread That I could not defend it. But the truth Shall be made manifest. I would not keep it; Nor thee, oh mother, would I longer keep 'Twixt hope and fear suspended. To my deed, My only motives are the general good, The safety of my people. Yet I prize, Remember yet the name of citizen: And shall display it; to the shame, perchance, Of such as trample with unholy feet Their country's sacred rites. I never, no, Never more worthy I esteem'd myself, Nor was, more worthy than I am to-day To fill my throne; yea, on the very moment, On which, self-moved, I from that throne descend. Pol. Lofty professions, from a lofty heart! Magnanimous as thy professions are I shall esteem thy nature; perhaps it is so. Time, and our deeds, at length will manifest Whether, in all things, our resemblance holds. I can assure thee, that the sceptre never Was, in my sight, less precious than to-day; To-day that I am destined to regain it. I have not been the first to tender peace, Though, perhaps, e'en more than others in my heart, Yea, in my very sword, I carry it. If I have not sent back the troops to Argos Thou know'st the reason ... Ete. What is it thou sayest? Whence should I know it? Can I read thy heart? Soon wilt thou reign; then shall we see how far Thou mak'st thy claim good to the name of hero. For the prosperity of Thebes, I wish That thou wert greater than thou seem'st, or art. Never could gnawing envy discompose My soul's tranquillity; thy government, If it please Thebes, will be by me commended; Although I now am destined to depart An exile from my country, evermore, Both in its adverse, or in its prosperous, state, I shall alike partake; and of my fate, Whate'er the colour of that fate may be, My soul shall be the master, not the slave: And in whatever land th'immortal gods May fix my destiny, those gods shall hear My fervent vows for thy successful sway. Pol. I also have endured a bitter exile, Sever'd from all that is on earth accounted Or dear or precious. Were it not that thou Wouldst deem the sight of me upon thy throne Far harder to endure than any exile, Painful as it might be, I would assure thee, Within this palace, in our native Thebes, Inviolable safety: but, alas! To hear thyself proclaim'd a subject here, Here, where thou hast so long the sceptre sway'd, Would be too exquisite a sufferance For thy exalted heart ... Ete. The alternate law, I fear, would scarcely be observed betwixt us. My presence, perhaps, in spite of my desire, Might here occasion tumults. If in Thebes I had no one to fear except my brother, I might securely there in privacy Pass on my days; but in a monarch's heart Suspicion is instinctive: and no king (However virtuous) has enough of virtue To banish from his heart the cleaving torment. Close by his royal side, upon the throne, Suspicion sits with flattery. For thy peace, And for my own peace, must I not stay here. I go: the example thou hast given me: I hope, alone, in my departure hence To imitate thy conduct: but once more, Far differently to what thyself hast done, In Thebes to reappear. Pol. Thou, in thy heart, Dost cherish a just hope; a hope that shews, Spite of thyself, thou deem'st me not forsworn, That thou art well assured, that I need not The sword to make me recollect my oath. Joc. My sons, what accents do I hear? Oh heavens, Do not I see at every word and gesture Your ill-concealed and unextinguished hate, In each of you break forth? And is this not The day, the hour, appointed by you both To terminate your misadventurous contest? And is not this the place where you proposed, With more coercive rites, and firmer faith, To renovate your violated oaths? How ill do taunting accents of defiance, How inauspiciously they usher in A compact so tremendous! On the lips Of each sit words of peace, while on each heart Sits war enthroned. Faith is by each invoked; Insult each reprobates, yet both indulge it; And each denies to give the faith he asks. Perhaps ere ye plight your oaths ye both are perjured: What boots delay, if this be not the case? Ete. Wise council; why should we a moment longer Delay the sacred rite? 'Tis most unwise To tamper thus with wounds heal'd partially. I will not sully, with contending more, That glory which is mine exclusively; The glory of bestowing peace on one That threatens me with overwhelming war. Bring there, ah bring to us, the sacred cup, And be the initiatory rite accomplished, The rite of our forefathers. May the oath, Yes, mother, may to-day the alternate oath Make thee, my sister, my afflicted country, Yea, all of you, secure! Behold the cup! My brother, contemplate it reverently! To thee I first present it. On its brim, Fill'd with a sacred terror, fix thy lips. The observer, not betrayer, of the laws, Swear to ascend the throne; and further swear, That to thy brother, when the year's accomplished, Thou wilt restore the sceptre of thy fathers. Pol. Why should I swear to yield what yet I grasp not? First thou shouldst swear thou wilt transfer it to me, I to restore it next ... Ete. Now art not thou He, that to Thebes brings tumult and disgrace, Slaughter and flames? Who but thyself alone Can reassure the apprehensive people, Weeping for thee, and kept by thee in torment? Matrons disconsolate depend on thee; Old age depends on thee; and trembling wives, And innocent babes (behold) towards thee stretch Their suppliant hands. Why dost thou now delay? 'Tis evident that all expect from thee, Expect from thee alone, the promised peace. Pol. This cup, which now thou bringest, is the pledge Of amity fraternal ... of thy faith? Ete. The pledge it is of sacred amity. Pol. Dar'st thou assert it? Ete. Canst thou doubt my word? Pol. Behold, then, from my brother I receive A pledge ... an infamous, unnatural pledge, ... Unnatural pledge of most unnatural hate, A pledge of everlasting hate betwixt us, Which in the blood of both of us alone Can be extinguished. Thebans, Antigone, Jocasta, witness how he keeps his faith. Eteocles,âThis cup has poison in it. Ete. Oh, vile suspicion! Liar! Joc. Do I hear it? Dar'st thou of such foul stain impeach thy brother? Pol. Yes, I dare do it. By thyself I swear, Oh mother, there is poison in the cup! And, mother, I swear not by thee in vain. The stain is dire and foul ... most foul ... yet true. Eteocles, dar'st thou give me the lie? First taste the cup: behold it: I consent To taste it afterwards, and with thee die. Ete. Because thou'rt worthy of a traitor's death, Dar'st thou, before all Thebes, to stigmatize Me with the crime of treason? What! Shall I Degrade myself to an unworthy test, To cure thee of suspicion? Thou dost feign An apprehension thou dost not believe, And awkwardly dost feign it ... fratricide! ... Infamous fratricide shall I contrive it? And if I wish the death that is thy due To give to thee, art thou not in my power? Why stoop to fraud while force is in my hands? Am I not yet a monarch in this Thebes? My subject thou, who could deliver thee From the tremendous anger of thy lord? Pol. 'Tis easy the deliverance from thy anger! But, ah! not easy from thy subtle frauds. Thy subject, I could make thee tremble; theeâ Thee, and thy minions, in thy very palace! But, conscious of thy guilt, thou hast no courage To challenge me to war. Ete. Even as thou Resumest all thy fury, I resume All mine; and every one is witness here That thou dost goad me to it ... Lay aside All pretexts; cast aside, without delay, The desecrated cup. Eternal war, Eternal hatred, thou hast sworn to me; Eternal war and hate to thee I swear. Joc. A little while delay. Give me that cup, Give it to me: Although it death contain, I fearlessly will press it to my lips. Happy, if on this day the gods fulfil My long desire for death. Thus, from the sight, The impious sight of my atrocious sons, I shall eternally obtain deliverance. One of you is a traitor! which I know not. The gods alone know this. Supernal powers, To you alone, on this ill-omen'd day, My vows are all directed: in that cup The truth lies hidden; it shall be reveal'd; Give it to me; the doubt shall be dispell'd. Pol. No; that shall never be ... Ant. What mad attempt, Oh mother! Polinices, grasp the cup. Securely grasp it, brother! 'Tis thy gift, Eteocles! What art thou doing? First Let Creon be brought hither; every crime To him is known, ... he is the prime instrument ... Joc. Unhand me, daughter; leave me; hold thy peace. Ah, where can Creon be? I have no wish To hear more tidings: death alone I wish; ... And in the troubled look of one of you ... And in the fatal silence, I perceive That death. Be satisfied. I haste to drink it. Ant. Refrain ... Pol. Oh, mother, from my hands the cup Thou vainly hop'st to gain ... Ete. Give me that cup, Give it to me: to earth I cast it thus: And break, at the same time, all peace betwixt us. I, in the field of battle, with my sword Th'infamous accusation will refute. Pol. One, skill'd to poison, ill will wield a sword. Ete. Too ardently I thirst to drink thy blood. Pol. Perchance my sword may drink thy blood the first. Ete. Perhaps, in the field, in our abhorred blood, We both at once may emulously bathe. Thou shalt there surely taste another cup; There we will drink each other's blood, and swear, As we gulp down the execrable poison, E'en after death, interminable hate. Pol. I swear at once to punish and despise thee. Ah! thou wert never worthy of my hatred; Nor art thou now. The abominable throne, By thee contaminate, with thee shall fall. Ah, could I thus destroy all memory Of our accursed and reprobated race! Ete. Now, truly, thou art brother of my blood! Joc. True sons ye are of Ådipus and me. I see again the furies rise in you Which erst presided o'er my nuptial bed. Now, now, ye hasten, with a horrid joy, To expiate my fault; and fratricide Shall make atonement for incestuous guilt. Why do ye linger, valiant as ye are? Why do ye interrupt your hellish rage? Ete. By a necessity we are constrain'd To consummate the stern decrees of fate: Of crime we are the offspring; in our veins Turpitude creeps connatural with our blood. [To Polinices. While thou hast time withdraw from me and vengeance, Quickly: ... before my sword ... Pol. What is thy sword? Ete. Fly, seek asylum in the Argive camp; E'en there I shall not fail to bring thee death. SCENE THE SECOND. Creon, Eteocles, Jocasta, Polinices, Antigone, Priests, People, Soldiers. Cre. We are betrayed; and broken is the truce; Adrastes on all sides the wall assaults, And with the ground threatens to level Thebes, If Polinices instantly appear not, Restored to liberty, without the gates. Ete. Adrastes! 'Tis not he that has betrayed us! I know the traitor well: I now could take On him and on Adrastes at a blow, On Polinices also, a fierce vengeance; What could prevent me, but that intense hatred Which, with one blow, would ill be satisfied! From Thebes securely, Polinices, go: Consider as a pledge of faith, the wish, The ardent wish, that, ever since my birth, I've cherish'd in my breast of meeting thee In the fierce trial of our rival swords. Thou, Creon, in the camp expect to die: By theban battle-axe, or argive sword, I leave it to thy choice. Joc. Oh, son! ... Ete. In vain Thou wouldst oppose. Joc. Ah, listen to me, son! ... Ete. Guards, let my mother stir not from the palace. No obstacle remains: I now expect To meet thee on the plain. SCENE THE THIRD. Jocasta, Polinices, Antigone. Pol. I hasten thither. Tremble. Joc. He is thy brother. Listen to me ... Pol. He is my enemy; he has betray'd me ... My honour ... Joc. Honour's voice bids thee abstain From all misdeeds. Oh, son! I pray thee pause ... What art thou rushing to perform? ... Oh heavens! Pol. And while for me Adrastes danger braves, Should I stay here subdued by women's tears? In vain the hope ... Joc. The sword ... thrust by thy hand ... Into thy brother's breast ... Pol. I am constrain'd On yonder plain to shew myself; I there Would gain an honour'd death. Him, whom thou call'st My brother, there I will not seek, and hope Not to encounter him. So much to thee I promise. Now farewell. Joc. Death steals on me. Ant. Have pity on thyself, on us have pity ... Pol. Deaf to all pity I am forced to be: I fly ... Joc. Ah, where? oh stop ... Pol. To death. Joc. He leaves me. SCENE THE FOURTH. Jocasta, Antigone. Joc. Alas! these eyes shall never see them more! ... Thou only now art left, my pitying child ... Ah, come with me, Antigone, and close The dying eyes of a heart-broken mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Jocasta. Joc. Antigone returns not. Hard constraint That here confines me! Trembling, and alone, Am I here destined from afar to hear The clamorous dissonance of th'unnatural strife? The consummation am I destined here To wait, of the abhorr'd fraternal vengeance? Wretch that I am! Do I live yet? Yet hope? What can I hope? I have no hope on earth: My life is the miraculous effect Of destiny, which wills that I should be Involved in fratricide, then cease to breathe. There doth remain no other trespass now, Except this crime, to perpetrate in Thebes; Shall not Jocasta be to this a witness? Oh ye, of Thebes the sovereign arbiters, Tremendous deities of realms below, Why do ye now delay to burst asunder âThe dark, unbottom'd, infinite abyss,â And instantly engulph us? I, perchance, Am I not she who to my son have given Both sons and brothers? Are not those fierce youths, That now in battle drink each other's blood, The fruit of horrid incest? We are yours, Entirely yours, infernal deities! ... Oh, pangs unuttered, and unutterable! All the affections of a mother move me, And yet to be a mother I abhor. But what has happened? Suddenly the din, The hollow din, of distant battle ceases ... To the tremendous dissonance succeeds A silence as tremendous ... fatal silence! ... To me the presage of more fatal tidings! Who knows? ... perchance the battle is suspended ... Ah me! ... perchance the fatal strife is over ... What should I think, alas! what hope, what fear? For whom breathe vows? For whom ask victory? Alas! for neither: are not both my sons? Oh thou, whoe'er thou beest, who palms hast won, Into my presence come not; tremble, fly; Delinquentâfly; entirely I devote My undivided pity to the conquered: Confederate shades, we will descend together To Pluto's realms, and ask for vengeance there: Nor can I ever bear to see a son That, o'er a brother gasping on the earth, Has raised the standard of flagitious conquest. SCENE THE SECOND. Antigone, Jocasta. Joc. Antigone ... thou speakest not ... thy face Is pale with hues of death. Oh, I have heard it, That silence, that excruciating silence! Ant. To a dire strife it yielded. Joc. Are they dead ... My sons? ... Ant. One only ... Joc. Which then lives? Ah, traitor, I will myself ... Ant. The combat I espied From yon high tower: he fell upon the earth Immersed in blood. Joc. Which? ... speak ... Ant. Eteocles. Joc. Thus Polinices hath fulfilled his promise, Thus died: ... thus shunn'd the execrable fight? Ah, miscreant! Thy abominable rage Thou then designedst to indulge, and cheat Thy mother. Tremble, for I yet am living; And from thy breast that impious heart I gave thee Will tear with my own hands. Ant. Thou know'st not all: Thy blame of Polinices is misplaced. Joc. I blame the living: he alone is guilty. Ant. Who knows if yet he lives! ah, wretched mother, If thou hast strength to listen, thou wilt learn, That he was more unfortunate than guilty. Scarce had he gain'd the plain, when round him press'd A valiant band of Argive warriors, Who, emulously, to the sky sent up A dreadful shout, announcing victory. In a remote part of the plain the battle Raged yet in doubtful conflict; in the midst Eteocles rose eminent: prepared, In front, to cope with him Adrastes stood; And his heart, full of lofty hardihood, Tydeus. Polinices, with swift feet, Towards the mingled contest ran: alarm Before him flew; and death pursued his steps, To right, to left, in front, in thousand shapes, And frightful all, a thousand deaths he dealt; Nor was the death he sought to him allotted. Where'er he turned his steps the Thebans wavered, Yielded, and fled; and hoped, by flight, to gain Opprobrious safety. From the flying troops Eteocles leaps forth in furious guise, And with a terrible accent he exclaims, âTo Polinices!â With precipitous rage His steps he traces, and at last he finds him ... Joc. Alas! oh dreadful! ... Did the other fly? Ant. How could he fly from such ferocious pride? Eteocles in haughty scorn broke forth; Taxed him with cowardice; defiance breathed; And by mere force dared him to single combat. âThebans,â he cried with a tremendous voice, âThebans and Argives, cease your guilty rage! âYe have descended to the field of battle âIn our contention, prodigal of life: âOurs is the strife, be ours the forfeiture. âLet us, ourselves, to a conclusion bring âThis unjust waste of blood, e'en in your presence, âAnd on this field of death. And thou, whom I âShould no more call my brother, do thou spare âThe blood of Thebes; thy hate, thy rage, thy sword, âAllâallâon me let fallâon me alone.â To speak and leap with fury to the charge, Were actions of one instant. Joc. Infamous! ... But how? to such a combat was the field, By those armed multitudes, surrendered tamely? Ant. An universal fear, at such a sight, Palsied the troops. Commingled as they were, Stupid, immoveable, both armies stood Spectators of the contest. Drunk with blood And fury, of his own life quite regardless, Provided his antagonist he slew, Eteocles upon his wretched brother Falls with his sword, and all his strength collects. For a long time, intent to ward his blows, Stands Polinices; generously he fears More for his wretched brother than himself, Refusing to attack him. But, at length, Seeing his brother obstinately chace him, And press upon him more and more, and force him, He cries, âI call to witness Heaven and Thebes, âThou will'st it.â While to Heaven his eyes he raised, And thus exclaim'd, his sword he onward thrust; The hovering furies guide the reckless blow To pierce the bosom of Eteocles. He falls. Upon his brother spouts his blood: Who, seeing this, towards his own breast turned The bloody, smoking sword ... I saw no more ... My senses, almost, at the cruel deed Forsook me; thick mists swam before my eyes; I flew, with tottering steps, and came to thee ... Alas! what will the consummation be Of this most fatal incident? ... Joc. 'Twill be, Doubt not, one worthy of our family! Ah, leave the care of that to the fell rage, The fury, of the persecuting gods. But who comes towards us? What do I behold? Dying Eteocles is hither borne. Ant. His warriors on each side support his steps! Joc. Ah, with what death-like slowness he advances! Ant. Yonder, see Polinices in his train! ... SCENE THE THIRD. Eteocles, Polinices, Jocasta, Antigone, Soldiers of Eteocles. Ant. [To Polinices.] Ah! thou at least art safe ... Pol. Touch me not, sister! I am all cover'd with my brother's blood. Joc. Ah wretch, ah infamous, ah fratricide! Dar'st thou approach the presence of a mother Whose son thou hast assassinated? Pol. No. 'Twas my desire never more to be Within thy presence living; I had turned, With a more furious hand against myself, The weapon fatal to my brother's life ... Joc. But yet thou art alive ... Ant. What life? oh, Heaven! Pol. Inopportunely Emon grasp'd my hand, And by main force disarmed it of its sword. Perhaps cruel fate designs that I should be By other hands transfix'd. If by thy hands, Strike, mother, strike, behold my naked breast: Why dost thou doubt? I am no more thy son, I, who deprived thee of another son. Joc. Be silent now; disturb not any longer Our parting moments. Oh, Eteocles, Dost thou not hear me? dost not recognise Her who now clasps thee to her tortured heart? It is thy mother; they are her warm tears, Mixed with thy blood, which thou feel'st trickling down Thy face and thy pierced bosom. I beseech thee, Once more thine eye-lids open. Ete. Oh, my mother! ... Tell me ... am I in Thebes? Joc. Within thy palace. Ete. Speak ... do I die a king? That traitor? ah! What do I see? Thou livest, and I ... die ... Pol. Thou shalt have all my blood; I have already Devoted all that blood to pacify Thy haughty and inexorable shade. Dispel thy anger; thou thyself, thou knowest, Soughtest thy death; with swift temerity Abandonedst thy bosom to my sword. Alas! the fatal blow robs thee of life, And, more than life, it robs me of my honour. Grant me thy pardon ere the fault I punish, Which baffles all attempt at reparation. Now that that hatred I have merited, The enmity of a vindictive brother, I think there is no pang that equals it. I swear I hate thee not; sight of thy blood, Th'atrocious sight, has banished from my heart All rancour ... wretched that I am, I see That thou'rt exasperated by my prayers. Ete. Of what speak'st thou? Thou, son of Ådipus, Dost pardon ask of me? Dost dare to hope, From one that springs from Ådipus, forgiveness? Joc. Oh son, oh son, do there in thy sick bosom Such bitter passions dwell? Ete. Within our breasts The impious furies have their throne erected: I do not feel that mine are fled from me; Nor though their blood is lost, that my foul veins Of their inbred and cleaving hate are cleansed. Oh, impious agony! ... atrocious rage! Livest thou yet? and hast thou conquer'd me? And shalt thou fill my throne? make haste, oh death, That I may never see the maddening sight. Pol. I ne'er will fill thy throne, again I swear it; Descend in peace to Pluto's dark abodes. To join thy sceptred ancestors, engarlanded With the imperial chaplet, shalt thou go, A haughty, sullen, and vindictive shade. I will obsequiously attend thee thither, Thy subject brother, a submissive shade. Oh calm a little the fierce turbulence Of that unconquerable mind! behold Me at thy feet; thou, thou art still my king. Before I rush to death, I do conjure thee To grant me pardon ... Joc. Thou shalt gain it. Thou, Eteocles, rise, rise above thy fate. Ah, pardon him, and render him more guilty. To his remorse transfer thy sated vengeance. Ant. And dost thou yet resist? oh heart of steel! By prayers, by agonies, thou art not moved. Nor by the tears of desperation shed By those thou most shouldst love. Joc. My son, my son, Refuse not to thy brother one embrace. There yet is time; ah, from thy fame avert Such stigma! Ete. Mother, 'tis thy will? ... 'tis well ... I yield ... come, then, oh brother, to the arms Of thy expiring brother ... slain by thee ... Come, to receive in this my last embrace Brother ... from me ... Feigning to embrace him, with a dagger he stabs him. the death thou meritest. Joc. Ah, treason! Ant. Polinices! ... Brother! ... slain ... Pol. Art thou now satisfied? Ete. I am revenged! ... I die ... yet thee I hate ... Pol. I also die; ... But pardon thee. Joc. Behold the work complete. These sons of incest, these unnatural brothers, Murder each other: mother, dost thou see, To whom there now remains nothing to lose? Ye gods, than us more guilty, prove your being By pealing thunders and volcanic fires, Tempesting heaven and earth: or gods there are not. But what do I behold? Beneath my feet Yawns the unfathomable, dire abyss! Ant. My mother ... Joc. Ah! I see them burst asunder The black, interminable realms of death: Thou lurid shade of Laius, dost thou stretch To me thy arms? to a flagitious wife? What do I see? Thou shew'st thy pierced breast? Thy hands and face, with clotted gore defiled, Thou weepest, and dost cry out aloud âRevenge!â Who made that horrid wound? what impious wretch? 'Twas Ådipus thy son, whom, in thy bed, Yet reeking with thy life-blood, I received. Who from another quarter beckons me? I hear a noise which makes e'en Pluto tremble; Behold the crash, the gleam, of warlike swords. Sons of my son, my sons, ferocious shades, Brothers, does strife e'en after death subsist? Oh, Laius, separate them. But, behold, Close at their side the grinning furies stand! Vengeful Eumenides, I am their mother; Rack me with that ensanguined, snaky scourge, This form incestuous, which could being give To such unnatural wretches. Furies, why, Ah why, delay! I rush to meet you ... Ant. Antigone supports her, and Jocasta falls in her arms. Mother!</field>
