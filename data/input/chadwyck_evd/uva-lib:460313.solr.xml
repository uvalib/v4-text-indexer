      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter SILENIUM, GYMNASIUM, and BAWD. SILENIUM. As I have hitherto, my dear Gymnasium, Lov'd you, and rank'd your mother and yourself Among my friends, so you've both made your friendship, This day apparent.âHad you been my sister, I know not how I could have been more honour'd. Indeed, in my poor thoughts it could not be. All other business have you laid aside So often, to devote yourselves to me. I own, on this account, my obligations Due to you both, and give you both, my thanks. Gym. By Pollux! easy 'tis on such conditions To visit you, and do you all good offices. So handsomely, and with such elegance You've din'd us, we shall ne'er forget the kindness. Sil. 'Twas done with a good will; and ev'ry thing I think you wish, it shall be mine to get. Bawd. 'Troth! I shall always think we came to you, Blown hither, as the sailors us'd to say, On a calm sea, and with a prosperous gale. So kindly have we been receiv'd to-day, Nor was there any thing displeasing to me, Except that silly customâ Sil. What! I pray you? Bawd. The fellow brought about the glass too seldom; And spoil'd besides the colour of the wine. Gym. Pray, is it decent here to mention it? Bawd. Decent! 'Tis rightâThere is no stranger here. Sil. My love's your due, who love and honour me. Bawd. It is but right, my dear Silenium, Our order 'mongst ourselves should keep up love, And aid each otherâWhen our dames of birth, And grandee matrons, you may see how they Cultivate friendship mutual; and cement Their mutual correspondence, if we do The same, and imitate their prudent custom. Yet thus scarce live we, they so envy us Of what they have, no share will they allow us. Yet would be glad to have us be without Strength of our own, and need their aid in all things, That we may live their supplicant dependants. Should you wait on them, you would rather give them Your room, than company.âBefore the world, 'Tis true, they're civil to us: but in private, Whene'er occasion offers, underhand They throw cold water on usâThey give out That we have commerce with their husbands; call us Their harlots; for they still would keep us under, Because we are the daughters but of slaves Made free; and not free women like themselves. Your mother and myself were of the trade; We both were courtezansâShe brought up you, And I this girl: [meaning Gymnasium.] from unknown parents both. Nor did I drive my own to prostitution, To gratify my vanity, but that I might have means to keep us both from starving. Sil. But surely, it had been more eligible To have got the girl an husbandâ Bawd. Ah! by Castor! She has every day an husband; one to-day; To-night she'll have anotherâI ne'er suffer The girl to lie in widow'd sheets.âThat soon Would bring our house to famine. Gym. It behoves me Ever to be what you would have me, mother. Bawd. 'Troth! if you'll ever be what I would have you, I sha'nt repent my painsâFor if you are What I would always have you, you will never Become a Hecale; but continue always As young and fair as now:âAnd while you fleece Others, you'll be a gain to me, without Farther expence of mine. Gym. The gods so grant it! Bawd. Without your help, the gods themselves can't do it. Gym. By Hercules! then, I'll do my best endeavours. But amidst all this chat, my dear Silenium, (I never saw you sadder) prithee tell me, Why so averse to mirth?âYou do not heed Your dress as heretoforeâHow deep you sigh! And then so paleâSpeak, tell us both the matter, And how we may assist youâDon't o'erwhelm me Thus with your grief, your trouble and your tears. Sil. I am uneasy, my Gymnasium, ill, And pine awayâMy spirit is depress'd, My eyes are painful; and I feel a faintnessâ What shall I say, but that my folly drives me To this sad state?â Gym. Be then your folly buried Where it aroseâ Sil. What shall I do? Gym. Why, hide it Inly, i'th'deep recesses of your breast: Be conscious of it to yourself alone. Let none else know it. Sil. But I've pain at heartâ Gym. What's that? From whence have you this pain at heart? Pray tell meâFor the men say, that a heart Is not in me, nor any other woman. Sil. If any heart I have that can feel pain, It pains meâIf I've none, I feel however, Pain hereâ[pointing to her heart.] Gym. The girl's in love! Sil. Is love, I pray you, So bitter then at first?â Gym. By Castor! love Hath both its gall and honey in abundance. Sweet to the tastâBut in't we swallow bitter Ev'n till we loathâ Sil. The malady with which I pine, my dear Gymnasium, has that form. Gym. Love's full of treachery. Sil. So he makes his spoils On meâ Gym. Take courageâYour disease will mend. Sil. I trust it would, were the physician present That could apply the medicine to this malady. Gym. Oh! he will comeâ Sil. A tedious word, he will, To a girl in love, unless he come indeed. But 'tis my fault I am tormented thus; Who still have wish'd with him, and him alone, To spend my days.â Gym. Well it becomes a wife To love one man; to wear out life with him, To whom she once is marriedâBut with us, A courtezan is like a wealthy town; Which cannot get a livelihood alone, But wants a multitude. Sil. Pray mind the affair In handâI'll tell you why I sent for you. My mother, finding me averse to the name Of courtezan, and, since I had in all things Obey'd her will, comply'd with me in this, To let me live with him I lov'd so dearly. Bawd. In troth, the more fool she!âBut have you never Kept company with any man? Sil. With none Except Alcesimarchus: neither has Another man injur'd my chastity. Bawd. And by what arts, I pray you, did this man Gain your good grace?â Sil. At Bacchus' feast it wasâ My mother carried me to see the shew.â As I return'd, he from his secret stand Had ey'd me to the doorâAnd from that time He by endearments, entertainments, presents, Engag'd at once her friendship and my own. Gym. Would any one procure me such a man, I'd give a good account of him, I warrant. Sil. What need of words?âA mutual intercourse Began a mutual passion 'twixt us both. Bawd. O my Silenium! Sil. What? Bawd. You should feign love, Not feel it; if you do, immediately You'll more regard the welfare of your lover Than of yourselfâ Sil. Ay, but he swore, in words Most sacred, to my mother, that he'd marry me; But now another is provided for him, A Lemnian, his relation, here hard by. His father's meer authority has done it. And now my mother is displeas'd with me, That I return'd not home, on my first knowledge Of his intended marriage with another. Bawd. Nothing's unfair in love. Sil. Permit, I prithee! Your daughter to be here only three days; And look to my house, while I attend my mother, Who has sent for me. Bawd. She's at your disposal. Tho' let me tell you, they will be three days Of trouble and of lossâ Sil. Friendly and kind! But, my Gymnasium, if while I am absent, Alcesimarchus come, chide him not roughly. Howe'er he has deserv'd of me, I love him. Be gentle with him, lest you anger him. Here are my keysâAnd if there's any thing You've need of, freely take itâI must goâ Gym. You have drawn tears into my eyes. Sil. My dear, Adieu! Gym. Of your dear self take care.âBut do you Go off so much in deshabille? Sil. 'Tis fit My dress should suit my fortunesâ Gym. But take up Your robe at leastâ Sil. No, let it drag; myself Am drag'd alongâ Gym. Since you will have it so, [taking up her robe. Adieu!âLook to your healthâ Sil. Yes, if I can. [Exit Sil. Gym. Well, mother, would you any thing with me, E'er I go in?âIn my mind, she's in love. Bawd. That's what I'm ever dinning in thy ears, Never to be in loveâGo, get you inâ Gym. Would you ought else? Bawd. Your healthâ Gym. And yoursâAdieu! [Exit Gym. SCENE II. Bawd. I am, for all the world, like half the sex That keep our tradeâSoon as we've got our load, We prate away, and chatter more than need. This very girl, that's now gone off in tears, Did I take up an infant, and expos'd In a lone lane, and bred her up as mine. Here is a certain youth, nobly alliedâ (Why should not I, now I have eat my fill, And got my skin full freely, free my tongueâ I cannot keep it, tho' so great a secret.) His father lives at Sicyon, of a family The noblest there.âThe youth grew desperate, Lost in the love of her you saw in tears, And she of himâI made a present of her To this MelÃ¦nis, a good friend of mine; Who oft had ask'd me for some boy or girl, An infant, whom she might pretend her own. Soon as I could, I granted her request, And gave her this.âWhen she had got the girl, She was directly brought to bed of her, Without a midwife, or child-bearing throes; Unlike those fools, who bring it on themselves. And then, to make a fair pretence for having A child supposititious, 'twas, forsooth, To flatter her gallant, some foreigner. We two alone are in the secret; I, Who gave the girl, and she, who took her of me. Except yourselves, indeed. [to the spectators.] This is the story. If any thing comes of it, you'll rememberâ I must trot homewardâ [Exit. SCENE III. The PROLOGUE. Enter AUXILIUM. Aux. How this old soul loves To tattle, and to tipple!âTho' a god, She has scarce left me any thing to say. She has forestall'd the market with her prate Of this supposititious girl; when, had she But held her tongue, I, who am call'd a god, Could have explain'd it betterâFor my name's AuxiliumâNow attend me, and I'll tell you How the plot lies.âAt Sicyon were the feasts Of Bacchus not long since, to which there came A certain Lemnian merchantâFull of wine And youth, he in the street, at dead of night, Compress'd a girlâConscious, for such a crime What he deserv'd, he, with his heels took shelter, And quick made off to Lemnos, where he liv'd. The girl was here deliver'd of a daughter, After due time; and, ignorant of the man That did the deed, her father's servant made Partaker of her project; and to him Gave the poor girl to be to death expos'd. This he strait didâThis woman took her upâ The servant cunningly observ'd the place, The house, to which the bantling was convey'd. The Bawd, as you have heard her own, but now, Gave her the courtezan MelÃ¦nis, who As her own daughter, educated her In honesty and virtueâNow, this Lemnian Married a neighbour, and a near relation. The wife was complaisant enough, and diedâ He, having paid due honours to her memory, Came hither, and was married to the girl He had compress'd; and knew her for the same. She told him, she, from the compression, was Deliver'd of a daughter, whom she gave To a servant, to expose immediately. That servant strait he orders to search out, If e'er she might be found who took her up: The servant to this task applied himself, Assiduous to find out the courtezan, Whom he, from his concealment, had observ'd To take away the child he had expos'd. I'll tell you now all that remains untold, And so discharge my debtâA youth there lives At Sicyon;âhis father is aliveâ This expos'd girl he loves to excess, the same You saw but now go weeping to her mother: She pays his love with that, which of all loves The sweetest is, love mutual.âBut such is The state of all things human, that no bliss Of man's perpetualâThe father thinks To give his son a wifeâHer mother hears it, And sends for her directly to come home. And thus the matter standsâFarewell! and conquer, As you was wont, with valour undismay'd. Retain your old allies, support your new ones. Still your supplies by your just laws increase. Destroy your foes, and praise and laurels gatherâ And may the vanquish'd Carthaginians still Feel from your arms their proper punishment. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter ALCESIMARCHUS and MELÃNIS. ALCESIMARCHUS. Love, I believe, was he who first invented The tortures us'd among mankind.âFor proof, I need not look abroad: from my own feelings I have sufficient ground for my conjectures. In feeling mutual tortures, I surpass All menâI'm toss'd, tormented, agitated, Prick'd, rack'd upon the wheel of love, distracted, Torn, fainting am I hurried round; and thus My inmost mind is in a cloud, that where I am, I am not; where I am not, there My mind is: such are all my faculties, I like and like not as the moment passes. Fatigu'd in mind, thus does love draw me on, Pursues, drives, drags me, seizes and retains, Drains me to nothing; and then gives me all: All that he gives, retracts, and so deludes me. From what he once persuaded, now dissuades; What he dissuaded, holds out to my choice. He treats me like the raging sea; and wrecks My mind to madness;ânor is there an evil I do not feel, but that I cannot down And sink outright. My father, in the country Detain'd me six days running at his seat there; Nor could I see the mistress of my soul. 'Tis horrid to relateâ Mel. D'you bam us thus, For that at Lemnos you've another mistress, Rich and betroth'd? Then have herâIt is true, We cannot number friends, or wealth with you; But I've no fear, our faith will stand as firm. If you are wrung, you know whence it proceeds. Alc. May all the gods confound me!â Mel. Take your wish. Alc. If e'er I marry her my father gives me! Mel. And me, if e'er I give into your arms Daughter of mine! Alc. And would you wish, MelÃ¦nis, I should forswear myself? Mel. Sooner than I And my affairs be ruin'd, and my girl Deluded thus.âBe gone, and find out those Will trust your oathsâWith us, Alcesimarchus, You've forfeited your title to our friendshipâ Alc. Try me but onceâ Mel. I've made that tryal oft; And have as oft had reason to repent. Alc. Nay, give her to meâ Mel. I, in this new matter, Of the old proverb will avail myself. What I have given, I wish I had not given; And what I have left ungiven, I shall not give. Alc. And so, you will not send her back again? Mel. Answer yourself for me. Alc. Not send her to me! Mel. You know my resolution, Sir, already. Alc. Fix'd in the heart? Mel. You think that I attend not: What you say now? 'troth I don't hear at all. Alc. Not hear? alas! then what is to be done? Mel. Think you of thatâYou know your own affairs. Alc. Why then, may all the gods and goddesses, Superiour, middle, and inferiour deities, May Juno, queen and daughter of high Jove, His uncle Saturnâ Mel. 'Troth, his father rather. Alc. May Ops the opulent, grandame of Jove!â Mel. His mother sayâ Alc. Ay, daughter, uncle, Joveâ You mad meâYou're the cause of all these blundersâ Mel. Proceed, proceedâ Alc. May I not know your mind? Mel. Say onâI never shall desistâ'Tis fix'dâ Alc. Why then, may Jupiter, may Juno, Saturnâ May allâI know not what to sayâYet stayâ Hear, womanâKnow, my resolution's taken. May all the gods, great, little, middle, all, Curse me; ne'er may I live to give Silenium A single kiss! if I destroy you not, Your daughter, you, myself, immediatelyâ And then to-morrow morning, murder both of you. And afterwards, the third time I attack you, By Hercules! I'll quite demolish youâ Unless you give her back to me again. I've said itâSo farewelâ [Exit. Mel. He is gone in, And in a rageâWhat am I now to do? If she return, things are but where they were. Whene'er dislike comes on him, out of doors He'll turn her, and bring home his Lemnian wifeâ But I will in and follow himâIn his frenzy He may do mischief, if we are not cautious. In short, as justice is not to be had, When poor with rich contend, I would much rather Take all my trouble in vain, than lose my daughter. But who's this hast'ning hither strait! On both sides Danger and dread attack and quite distract me. [goes apart. SCENE II. Enter LAMPADISCUS. Lam. I've follow'd the old woman thro' the streets, And plagu'd her with my clamourâHow she's been Upon her guard, and would remember nothing!â How have I sooth'd the jade! how promis'd mountains! What arts have I not us'd, what tricks not tried! With much ado, I forc'd from her the truth, Upon my promise of a keg of wine. SCENE III. Enter PHANOSTRATA. Pha. Methought I heard the voice of Lampadiscus, My servant, 'fore the house! Lam. You are not deaf, Mistress;âyou heard aright. Pha. Why are you here? Lam. To give you joyâ Pha. Well, what's the matter now? Lam. But now I saw a woman quit these doors. Pha. She that took up my daughter? Lam. 'Twas the same. Pha. What follow'd? Lam. I then told her how I'd seen her Take up my master's daughter in the Hippodromeâ Pha. And shew'd she any fear?â Mel. [apart.] I tremble now. How my heart leaps!âFor well I recollect The infant girl was brought me from the Hippodrome, Whom I've brought up my ownâ Pha. Say on, I prayâ My soul's impatient to hear all your tale. Mel. [apart.] Would you could hear no more!â Lam. Then I proceed? And with the daughter talk in terms like these: Depend upon it, your chance-mother here, Calls you hers, meerly lest you should desert her. She's but your nurse, then think her not your mother. I am the man recalls, and leads you back To opulence; where you may place yourself In a rich family; and your father may A dowry give of twenty talents with you. Nor will you here, after the Tuscan mode, By prostitution be obliged to obtain A dowry. Pha. Is she, say, a courtezan That took her up? Lam. She was a courtezanâ But I'll unfold to you the whole affairâ I had just brought the girl by my persuasion To my opinion: when, with tears, intreaties, Clasping her knees, th'old woman begg'd and pray'd She'd not desert her;âswore in sacred terms She was her daughter, and she had given her life. Her whom you seek, she cried, I gave to a friend, To bring up as a daughter of her own; And she is still aliveâWhere is she, say? Insisted Iâ Pha. Preserve me, gods! I pray. Mel. [apart.] But me you have undone. Pha. You should have ask'd To whom she gave herâ Lam. I did askâShe told me, She gave her to the courtezan MelÃ¦nisâ Mel. [apart.] He names me too!âUndone!â Lam. When she was silent, I question'd the old woman the next moment. Where lives she, said I?âLeadâShew me the house. She's carried off, she cries, and lives abroad. Mel. [apart.] That brings cold water to a fainting wretch. Lam. Where'er she's gone, we shall pursue herâWhat! D'you trifle with us?âYour destruction's nearâ Not thus far off, by Hercules!âI insisted, 'Till the old woman swore, she'd shew the place. Pha. 'Twas wrong to let her goâ Lam. O! she is safeâ But said, there was a certain female friend, Involv'd with her in this affair, with whom She'd wish to meetâI know that she will come. Mel. [apart.] She will discover me, and in her distress Involve me too. Pha. What am I now to do? Lam. Go in; and keep your spirits up, be sure. If your good man come home, bid him stay there In case I want him, that he be i'th'way. I must run back again to the old woman. Pha. Take care now, Lampadiscusâ Lam. Never fear, I'll give a good account of the affair. Pha. My hopes are in the gods and youâ Lam. And mine, That you may see your daughter safe at home. Mel. Stay, stay, young man, and hear meâ Lam. Is it me You speak to, woman?â Mel. Youâ Lam. What would you with me? For I am very busyâ Mel. Who lives here? Lam. My master Demipho.â Mel. Is it the same Who has betroth'd his daughter to the youth Of such great wealth, Alcesimarchus? Lam. He.â Mel. What other daughter are you searching for? Lam. I'll tell you.âHis wife's daughter, tho' she's not The daughter of his wifeâ Mel. What riddle's that? Lam. Know then, my master had another daughter, And by another womanâ Mel. Yet but now You surely said, you were in search of one, Daughter of her you talk'd with. Lam. True, I am. Mel. Then, prithee, say, how this can be the first, Who's now his wife? Lam. You weary me with prating, Woman, whoe'er you areâThe middle woman, Who was his wife, he had this daughter by, Giv'n to AlcesimarchusâThis wife diedâ You take me now?â Mel. I understand that well. But how the first is last, the last is first; This is the knot I would untieâ Lam. Truth is, He had this dame before he married herâ She was with child by him, and brought forth a daughter, Whom, yet an infant, she expos'dâI am The very man expos'd herâBut a woman, Some other, took her up, while I look'd on. After some time, my master weds the motherâ And 'tis that daughter we are now in search ofâ Why lift you up your hands and eyes to heaven? Mel. Proceed now, whither you so fast were goingâ I stop you notâI see the whole affairâ Lam. Thanks to the gods, or else, you'd ne'er have left me. [Exit. Mel. However ill inclin'd, 'tis now my business, Spite of my teeth, to be an honest womanâ The secret's out; and better 'tis for me To make friends here, than have the bawd detect me. I'll home, and bring Silenium to her parents. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>

I've told you allâNow follow, my Silenium, To those, who've better claim to you than I. Tho' I shall miss you much, I'll reconcile My mind, to what conduces to your good. Here, in this casket, you shall find the toys Giv'n me by her, who left you with me first; By which you might more easily be known. This casket take, Halisca: [giving it] and with speed Knock at that door, and let them know, I beg Somebody would come out to me directly. SCENE II. Enter to them ALCESIMARCHUS, with his sword drawn.

See'st not Alcesimarchus, with his swordâ Alc. What art about?âWhy this delay?âQuit, quit The light at onceâ Sil. Run, runâBeseech you, help! Lest he destroy himselfâ [Halisca running to assist, drops the casket. Alc. My goddess, safety, Sweeter than safety to a wretch like me! 'Tis you alone, whether I will or no, 'Tis you, preserve my life.â Mel. Could you've been guilty Of such a dismal act? Alc. I've nought with thee. Dead am I to thy voiceâBut here I have her; Nor will I ever lose her moreâBy Hercules! She's here, and rivetted to me for ever.â Where are ye, slaves?âSoon as I have her safe Over the threshold; bolt, bar, chain the doors. [carries Silenium into the house. Mel.

I never knew one worthier of the torture Than this old jade!âWhat!âTo deny pointblank All she'd confess'd!âBut see, my mistress comes! What's here?âA casket!âtrinkets!âWhat means this?â [seeing the casket which Halisca had dropt. Nobody's nearâI'll play a childish trick And stoop to itâ [taking up the casket. Enter PHANOSTRATA. Pha. What art about, Lampadio? Lam. This casket, mistressâWas it from our house?â For here I took it up, just at the doorâ Pha. What news from the old woman? Lam. News! There's not On earth so vile a jadeâWhy, she denies Each circumstance that she confess'd but nowâ And shall I let the jade delude me thus? NoâI'll die any death rather than bear it. Pha. Gods! I adjure you! [looking in the casket.] Lam. Why call on the gods? Pha. Save us! Lam. What is't?â Pha. These are the very trinkets Along with which you expos'd my girl to die. Lam. Art in thy senses? Pha. [still looking at them.] They're the very same. Lam. Persist you?â Pha. Yes, the sameâ [still looking at them. Lam. If any woman But you had said it, I had thought her drunk. Pha. I speak not idly. No, by Castor's templeâ Say, whence should these things beâThis casket, say, What god could lay it 'fore our very door?

If the gods Lend me not help, I am undoneâNor know I Where to apply, so vex'd am I in mind. I dread my back, should but my mistress know How careless I have beenâDid I not here, Before these doors receive, and in my hands Hold fast the casket?âWhere it is, I know not; Unless, as I imagine was the case, I dropt it Just hereaboutâGood folk, spectators, say, Has any body found it? Ta'en it away? Or who?âI pray you, this or that way, went he!â But I am ne'er the wiser to ask these, And vex myselfâThey're sure to take a pleasure In the misfortunes of our sexâI'll mark If there are any footsteps; for the casket, If no one has been here since I went in, Must have laid hereâAnd what's this here!â'Tis goneâ 'Tis lost I fearâUnhappy, careless wretch! 'Tis goneâAnd, by the loss, I'm lost myself. But I'll go on as I begun, and search.

Who calls you?âA good woman, And a bad manâ Hal. Away with all that's bad: I want the goodâ[going.] Yet, whoe'er calls me back, Knows better what he'd have, than I who'm call'dâ I will returnâ[to Lam.] Have you seen any one Pick up a casket hereabout of trinkets, That I, unlucky, lost?âFor in my fright, While we all ran to stop Alcesimarchus From an attempt upon his life, I think, I drop'd the casket hereâ Lam. This is our woman. Mistress, let us attendâ Hal. I'm quite undone! What answer to my mistress, who with care Gave it in charge, as the best means by which Silenium might her parents know again; The girl my mistress brought up from a child, Whom from the courtezan she hadâ Lam. She tells Our very taleâAnd, giving us these marks, Knows where your daughter isâ Hal. She doesâAnd now Most willingly would give her to her parentsâ You're absent, friend, [to Lam.] and minding other mattersâ I commend mine to youâ Lam. They're yours I'm minding. And all you say, I swallow like my foodâ I only answer'd by the bye, to a question My mistress ask'dâNow I return to youâ If you have need, say; and command my service. What was you seeking?â Hal. Friend!âGood lady too! I greet youâ Pha. And we youâWhat are you seeking? Hal. Why, I was tracing out the marks of somewhat. I've some how lostâ Pha. What is it?âspeakâWhat is it? Hal. SomethingâA loss to someâBut to our family A great concernâ Lam. A slippery chap, I doubtâ And slyâHa!âMistress!â Pha. So she seems, by Castor! Lam. She's like a vile and cursed animalâ Pha. What animal? Lam. A caterpillar she, That in a vine leaf winds itself about; So winds she in her storyâSay, what seek you? Hal. A casket, youth, just now escap'd from me. Lam. Escap'd!âYou should have got a larger cage. Hal. The prey was not so greatâ Lam. A wonder that! A little casket holds much money's-worth. Pha. Let her go onâ Lam. She has my free leave to do so. Pha. Say then, what was within? Hal. Some childrens toys. Lam. Here is a certain man knows where it isâ Hal. And here's a certain woman, would be thankful, Would he produce itâ Lam. But this certain man Expects to be rewarded for his pains. Hal. Ay, but the woman has not wherewithal, Who has lost the casketâ Lam. He demands some money. Hal. He may demand it, but to little purpose. Lam. He will not, woman, give his pains for nothing. Pha. Have done your prateâ'Twill be to your advantage. I do confess, I have myself your casket. Hal. Salvation's self be with you! But where is it? Pha. 'Tis here, and safeâBut I would talk with you Of this my great concernâAnd here I make you Partaker of my happinessâ Hal. What mean you?â Who are you?â Pha. I'm the mother of that girl, Who had these toys about her when expos'd. Hal. And do you then live here? Pha. Your guess is right. But I beseech you, woman, to the point, And lay aside all circumstanceâSpeak outâ How did these toys come first into your hands? Hal. They were my mistress' daughter's. Lam. That's a lieâ They were my mistress' property, not yours. Pha. Don't interrupt herâ Lam. I am dumbâ Pha. Go on, Woman; and tell me where the owner isâ Hal. Here in the neighbourhoodâ Pha. By Pollux' temple! My husband's son-in-law lives thereâ Lam. Most trueâ Pha. Still are you interrupting me?âGo onâ What do they call her age? Hal. Just seventeen. Pha. She is my daughter thenâ Lam. Her age confirms it. Hal. All that you sought, you've foundâI'll seek my mistressâ Lam. They've all they wantâI'll seek a mistress tooâ Pha. I've found my daughter, whom with care I sought for. Hal. Safe to return, what once is given in trust, Is just and right; else, the benevolent Suffers, who did the kindness.âThis our foundling, Doubtless, turns out your daughterâAnd my mistress Will sure return your ownâWith that intent She left her houseâBest learn the whole from her; I'm but a servantâ Pha. All you ask is rightâ Hal. I choose you owe to her the obligationâ But I beseech you, give me up the casketâ Pha. What say you, Lampadiscus? Lam. 'Tis your own; And you should keep your ownâ Pha. And yet, I pity her. Lam. In my opinion, this you ought to doâ Give her the casket, and go in with herâ Pha. I'll follow your adviceâHere, take the casketâ [giving it. And let's go inâBut, what's your mistress' name? Hal. MelÃ¦nisâ Pha. Lead the wayâI'll follow you. [Exeunt.
