      <field name="fulltext">WARDER. The gods I ask deliverance from these labours, Watch of a year's length whereby, slumbering through it On the Atreidai's roofs on elbow,âdog-likeâ I know of nightly star-groups the assemblage, And those that bring to men winter and summer Bright dynasts, as they pride them in the Ã¦ther âStars, when they wither, and the uprisings of them. And now on ward I wait the torch's token, The glow of fire, shall bring from Troia message And word of capture: so prevails audacious The man's-way-planning hoping heart of woman. But when I, driven from night-rest, dew-drenched hold to This couch of mineânot looked upon by visions, Since fear instead of sleep still stands beside me, So as that fast I fix in sleep no eyelidsâ And when to sing or chirp a tune I fancy, For slumber such song-remedy infusing, I wail then, for this House's fortune groaning, Not, as of old, after the best ways governed. Now, lucky be deliverance from these labours, At good newsâthe appearing dusky fire! O hail, thou lamp of night, a day-long lightness Revealing, and of dances the ordainment! Halloo, halloo! To Agamemnon's wife I show, by shouting, That, from bed starting up at once, i' the household Joyous acclaim, good-omened to this torch-blaze, She send aloft, if haply Ilion's city Be taken, as the beacon boasts announcing. Ay, and, for me, myself will dance a prelude, For, that my masters' dice drop right, I'll reckon: Since thrice-six has it thrown to me, this signal. Well, may it hap that, as he comes, the loved hand O' the household's lord I may sustain with this hand! As for the rest, I'm mute: on tongue a big ox Has trodden. Yet this House, if voice it take should, Most plain would speak. So, willing I myself speak. To those who know: to who know notâI'm blankness. CHOROS. The tenth year this, since Priamos' great match, King Menelaos, Agamemnon King, âThe strenuous yoke-pair of the Atreidai's honour Two-throned, two-sceptred, whereof Zeus was donorâ Did from this land the aid, the armament despatch, The thousand-sailored force of Argives clamouring âAresâ from out the indignant breast, as fling Passion forth vultures which, because of grief Away,âas are their young ones,âwith the thief, Lofty above their brood-nests wheel in ring, Row round and round with oar of either wing, Lament the bedded chicks, lost labour that was love: Which hearing, one above âWhether Apollon, Pan or Zeusâthat wail, Sharp-piercing bird-shriek of the guests who fare Housemates with gods in airâ Suchanone sends, against who these assail, What, late-sent, shall not fail Of punishingâErinus. Here as there, The Guardian of the Guest, Zeus, the excelling one, Sends against Alexandros either son Of Atreus: for that wife, the many-husbanded, Appointing many a tug that tries the limb, While the knee plays the prop in dust, while, shred To morsels, lies the spear-shaft; in those grim Marriage-prolusions when their Fury wed Danaoi and Troes, both alike. All's said: Things are where things are, and, as fate has willed, So shall they be fulfilled. Not gently-grieving, not just doling out The drops of expiationâno, nor tears distilledâ Shall he we know of bring the hard about To softâthat intense ire At those mock rites unsanctified by fire. But we pay nought here: through our flesh, age-weighed, Left out from who gave aid In that day,âwe remain, Staying on staves a strength The equal of a child's at length. For when young marrow in the breast doth reign, That's the old man's match,âAres out of place In either: but in oldest age's case, Foliage a-fading, why, he wends his way On three feet, and, no stronger than a child, Wanders about gone wild, A dream in day. But thou, Tundareus' daughter, Klutaimnestra queen, What need? What new? What having heard or seen, By what announcement's tidings, everywhere Settest thou, round about, the sacrifice a-flare? For, of all gods the city-swaying, Those supernal, those infernal, Those of the fields', those of the mart's obeying,â The altars blaze with gifts; And here and there, heaven-high the torch uplifts Flameâmedicated with persuasions mild, With foul admixture unbeguiledâ Of holy unguent, from the clotted chrism Brought from the palace, safe in its abysm. Of these things, speaking what may be indeed Both possible and lawful to concede, Healer do thou become!âof this solicitude Which, now, stands plainly forth of evil mood, And, then . . . but from oblations, hope, to-day Gracious appearing, wards away From soul the insatiate care, The sorrow at my breast, devouring there! Empowered am I to sing The omens, what their force which, journeying, Rejoiced the potentates: (For still, from God, inflates My breast song-suasion: age, Born to the business, still such war can wage) âHow the fierce bird against the Teukris land Despatched, with spear and executing hand, The Achaian's two-throned emperyâo'er Hellas' youth Two rulers with one mind: The birds' king to these kings of ships, on high, âThe black sort, and the sort that's white behind,â Appearing by the palace, on the spear-throw side, In right sky-regions, visible far and wide,â Devouring a hare-creature, great with young, Baulked of more racings they, as she from whom they sprung! Ah, Linos, sayâah, Linos, song of wail! But may the good prevail! The prudent army-prophet seeing two The Atreidai, two their tempers, knew Those feasting on the hare The armament-conductors were; And thus he spoke, explaining signs in view. âIn time, this outset takes the town of Priamos: But all before its towers,âthe people's wealth that was, Of flocks and herds,âas sure, shall booty-sharing thence Drain to the dregs away, by battle violence. Only, have care lest grudge of any god disturb With cloud the unsullied shine of that great force, the curb Of Troia, struck with damp Beforehand in the camp! For envyingly is The virgin Artemis Towardâher father's flying houndsâthis Houseâ The sacrificers of the piteous And cowering beast, Brood and all, ere the birth: she hates the eagles' feast. Ah, Linos, sayâah, Linos, song of wail! But may the good prevail! âThus ready is the beauteous one with help To those small dewdrop-things fierce lions whelp, And udder-loving litter of each brute That roams the mead; and therefore makes she suit, The fair one, for fulfilment to the end Of things these signs portendâ Which partly smile, indeed, but partly scowlâ The phantasms of the fowl. I call IeÃ¯os Paian to avert She work the Danaoi hurt By any thwarting waftures, long and fast Holdings from sail of ships: And sacrifice, another than the last, She for herself precipitateâ Something unlawful, feast for no man's lips, Builder of quarrels, with the House cognateâ Having in awe no husband: for remains A frightful, backward-darting in the path, Wily house-keeping chronicler of wrath, That has to punish that old children's fate!â Such things did Kalchas,âwith abundant gains As well,âvociferate, Predictions from the birds, in journeying, Above the abode of either king. With these, symphonious, singâ Ah, Linos, sayâah, Linos, song of wail! But may the good prevail! Zeus, whosoe'er he be,âif that express Aught dear to him on whom I callâ So do I him address. I cannot liken out, by all Admeasurement of powers, Any but Zeus for refuge at such hours, If veritably needs I must From off my soul its vague care-burthen thrust. Notâwhosoever was the great of yore, Bursting to bloom with bravery all roundâ Is in our mouths: he was, but is no more. And who it was that after came to be, Met the thrice-throwing wrestler,âhe Is also gone to ground. But âZeusââif any, heart and soul, that nameâ Shouting the triumph-praiseâproclaim, Complete in judgment shall that man be found. Zeus, who leads onward mortals to be wise, Appoints that suffering masterfully teach. In sleep, before the heart of each, A woe-remembering travail sheds in dew Discretion,âay, and melts the unwilling too By what, perchance, may be a graciousness Of gods, enforced no less,â As they, commanders of the crew, Assume the awful seat. And then the old leader of the Achaian fleet, Disparaging no seerâ With bated breath to suit misfortune's inrush here â(What time it laboured, that Achaian host, By stay from sailing,âevery pulse at length Emptied of vital strength,â Hard over Kalchis shore-bound, current-crost In Aulis station,âwhile the winds which post From Strumon, ill-delayers, famine-fraught, Tempters of man to sail where harbourage is naught, Spendthrifts of ships and cables, turning time To twice the length,âthese carded, by delay, To less and less away The Argeians' flowery prime: And when a remedy more grave and grand Than aught before,âyea, for the storm and dearth,â The prophet to the foremost in command Shrieked forth, as cause of this Adducing Artemis, So that the Atreidai striking staves on earth Could not withhold the tear)â Then did the king, the elder, speak this clear. âHeavy the fate, indeed,âto disobey! Yet heavy if my child I slay, The adornment of my household: with the tide Of virgin-slaughter, at the altar-side, A father's hands defiling: which the way Without its evils, say? How shall I turn fleet-fugitive, Failing of duty to allies? Since for a wind-abating sacrifice And virgin blood,â't is right they strive, Nay, madden with desire. Well may it work themâthis that they require!â But when he underwent necessity's Yoke-trace,âfrom soul blowing unhallowed change Unclean, abominable,âthenceâanother manâ The audacious mind of him began Its wildest range. For this it is gives mortals hardihoodâ Some vice-devising miserable mood Of madness, and first woe of all the brood. The sacrificer of his daughterâstrange!â He dared become, to expedite Woman-avenging warfare,âanchors weighed With such prelusive rite! Prayings and callings âFatherâânaught they made Of these, and of the virgin-age,â Captains heart-set on war to wage! His ministrants, vows done, the father badeâ Kid-like, above the altar, swathed in pall, Take herâlift high, and have no fear at all, Head-downward, and the fair mouth's guard And frontage hold,âpress hard From utterance a curse against the House By dint of bitâviolence bridling speech. And as to ground her saffron-vest she shed, She smote the sacrificers all and each With arrow sweet and piteous, From the eye only sped,â Significant of will to use a word, Just as in pictures: since, full many a time, In her sire's guest-hall, by the well-heaped board Had she made music,âlovingly with chime Of her chaste voice, that unpolluted thing, Honoured the third libation,âpaian that should bring Good fortune to the sire she loved so well. What followedâthose things I nor saw nor tell. But Kalchas' arts,âwhate'er they indicate,â Miss of fulfilment never: it is fate. True, justice makes, in sufferers, a desire To know the future woe preponderate. Butâhear before is need? To that, farewell and welcome! 't is the same, indeed, As grief beforehand: clearly, part for part, Conformably to Kalchas' art, Shall come the event. But be they as they may, things subsequent,â What is to do, prosperity betide E'en as we wish it!âwe, the next allied, Sole guarding barrier of the Apian land. I am come, reverencing power in thee, O Klutaimnestra! For 't is just we bow To the ruler's wife,âthe male-seat man-bereaved. But if thou, having heard good news,âor none,â For good news' hope dost sacrifice thus wide, I would hear gladly: art thou mute,âno grudge! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Good-news-announcer, mayâas is the by-wordâ Morn become, truly,ânews from Night his mother! But thou shalt learn joy past all hope of hearing. Priamos' city have the Argeioi taken. CHOROS. How sayest? The word, from want of faith, escaped me. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Troia the Achaioi hold: do I speak plainly? CHOROS. Joy overcreeps me, calling forth the tear-drop. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Right! for, that glad thou art, thine eye convicts thee. CHOROS. Forâwhat to thee, of all this, trusty token? KLUTAIMNESTRA. What's here! how else? unless the god have cheated. CHOROS. Haply thou flattering shows of dreams respectest? KLUTAIMNESTRA. No fancy would I take of soul sleep-burthened. CHOROS. But has there puffed thee up some unwinged omen? KLUTAIMNESTRA. As a young maid's my mind thou mockest grossly. CHOROS. Well, at what time wasâeven sacked, the city? KLUTAIMNESTRA. Of this same mother Nightâthe dawn, I tell thee. CHOROS. And who of messengers could reach this swiftness? KLUTAIMNESTRA. Hephaistosâsending a bright blaze from Ide. Beacon did beacon send, from fire the poster, Hitherward: Ide to the rock Hermaian Of Lemnos: and a third great torch o' the island Zeus' seat received in turn, the Athoan summit. And,âso upsoaring as to stride sea over, The strong lamp-voyager, and all for joyanceâ Did the gold-glorious splendour, any sun like, Pass onâthe pine-treeâto Makistos' watch-place; Who did not,âtardy,âcaught, no wits about him, By sleep,âdecline his portion of the missive. And far the beacon's light, on stream Euripos Arriving, made aware Messapios' warders, And up they lit in turn, played herald onwards, Kindling with flame a heap of grey old heather. And, strengthening still, the lamp, decaying nowise, Springing o'er Plain Asopos,âfull-moon-fashion Effulgent,âtoward the crag of Mount Kithairon, Roused a new rendering-up of fire the escortâ And light, far escort, lacked no recognition O' the guardâas burning more than burnings told you. And over Lake Gorgopis light went leaping, And, at Mount Aigiplanktos safe arriving, Enforced the lawââto never stint the fire-stuff.â And they send, lighting up with ungrudged vigour, Of flame a huge beard, ay, the very foreland So as to strike above, in burning onward, The look-out which commands the Strait Saronic. Then did it dart until it reached the outpost Mount Arachnaios here, the city's neighbour; And then darts to this roof of the Atreidai This light of Ide's fire not unforefathered! Such are the rules prescribed the flambeau-bearers: He beats that's first and also last in running. Such is the proof and token I declare thee, My husband having sent me news from Troia. CHOROS. The gods, indeed, anon will I pray, woman! But now, these words to hear, and sate my wonder Thoroughly, I am fainâif twice thou tell them. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Troia do the Achaioi hold, this same day. I think a noiseâno mixtureâreigns i' the city. Sour wine and unguent pour thou in one vesselâ Standers-apart, not lovers, wouldst thou style them: And so, of captives and of conquerors, partwise The voices are to hear, of fortune diverse. For those, indeed, upon the bodies prostrate Of husbands, brothers, children upon parents âThe old men, from a throat that's free no longer, Shriekingly wail the death-doom of their dearest: While theseâthe after-battle hungry labour, Which prompts night-faring, marshals them to breakfast On the town's store, according to no billet Of sharing, but as each drew lot of fortune. In the spear-captured Troic habitations House they already: from the frosts upÃ¦thral And dews delivered, will they, luckless creatures, Without a watch to keep, slumber all night through. And if they fear the gods, the city-guarders, And the gods' structures of the conquered country, They may notâcapturersâsoon in turn be captive. But see no prior lust befall the army To sack things sacredâby gain-cravings vanquished! For there needs homeward the return's salvation, To round the new limb back o' the double race-course. And guilty to the gods if came the army, Awakened up the sorrow of those slaughtered Might beâshould no outbursting evils happen. But may good beatâno turn to see i' the balance! For, many benefits I want the gain of. CHOROS. Woman, like prudent man thou kindly speakest. And I, thus having heard thy trusty tokens, The gods to rightly hail forthwith prepare me; For, grace that must be paid has crowned our labours. O Zeus the king, and friendly Night Of these brave boons bestowerâ Thou who didst fling on Troia's every tower The o'er-roofing snare, that neither great thing might, Nor any of the young ones, overpass Captivity's great sweep-netâone and all Of Ate held in thrall! Ay, Zeus I fearâthe guest's friend greatâwho was The doer of this, and long since bent The bow on Alexandros with intent That neither wide o' the white Nor o'er the stars the foolish dart should light. The stroke of Zeusâthey have it, as men say! This, at least, from the source track forth we may! As he ordained, so has he done. âNoââsaid someoneâ âThe gods think fit to care Nowise for mortals, such As those by whom the good and fair Of things denied their touch Is trampled!â but he was profane. That they do care, has been made plain To offspring of the over-bold, Outbreathing âAresâ greater than is justâ Houses that spill with more than they can hold, More than is best for man. Be man's what must Keep harm off, so that in himself he find Sufficiencyâthe well-endowed of mind! For there's no bulwark in man's wealth to him Who, through a surfeit, kicksâinto the dim And disappearingâRight's great altar. Yesâ It urges him, the sad persuasiveness, Ate's insufferable child that schemes Treason beforehand: and all cure is vain. It is not hidden: out it glares again, A light dread-lamping-mischief, just as gleams The badness of the bronze; Through rubbing, puttings to the touch, Black-clotted is he, judged at once. He seeksâthe boyâa flying bird to clutch, The insufferable brand Setting upon the city of his land Whereof not any god hears prayer; While him who brought about such evils there, That unjust man, the god in grapple throws. Such an one, Paris goes Within the Atreidai's houseâ Shamed the guest's board by robbery of the spouse. And, leaving to her townsmen throngs a-spread With shields, and spear-thrusts of sea-armament, And bringing Ilion, in a dowry's stead, Destructionâswiftly through the gates she went, Daring the undareable. But many a groan outbroke From prophets of the House as thus they spoke. âWoe, woe the House, the House and Rulers,âwoe The marriage-bed and dints A husband's love imprints! There she stands silent! meets no honourâno Shameâsweetest still to see of things gone long ago! And, through desire of one across the main, A ghost will seem within the house to reign. And hateful to the husband is the grace Of well-shaped statues: fromâin place of eyes Those blanksâall Aphrodite dies. âBut dream-appearing mournful fantasiesâ There they stand, bringing grace that's vain. For vain 't is, when brave things one seems to view; The fantasy has floated off, hands through; Gone, that appearance,ânowise left to creep,â On wings, the servants in the paths of sleep!â Woes, then, in household and on hearth, are such As theseâand woes surpassing these by much. But not these only: everywhereâ For those who from the land Of Hellas issued in a band, Sorrow, the heart must bear, Sits in the home of each, conspicuous there. Many a circumstance, at least, Touches the very breast. For those Whom any sent away,âhe knows: And in the live man's stead, Armour and ashes reach The house of each. For Ares, gold-exchanger for the dead, And balance-holder in the fight o' the spear, Due-weight from Ilion sendsâ What moves the tear on tearâ A charred scrap to the friends: Filling with well-packed ashes every urn, For manâthat wasâthe sole return. And they groanâpraising much, the while, Now this man as experienced in the strife, Now that, fallen nobly on a slaughtered pile, Because ofânot his ownâanother's wife. But things there be, one barks, When no man harks: A surreptitious grief that's grudge Against the Atreidai who first sought the judge. But some there, round the rampart, have In Ilian earth, each one his grave: All fair-formed as at birth, It hid themâwhat they have and holdâthe hostile earth. And big with anger goes the city's word, And pays a debt by public curse incurred. And ever with meâas about to hear A something night-involvedâremains my fear: Since of the many-slayersânot Unwatching are the gods. The black Erinues, at due periodsâ Whoever gains the lot Of fortune with no rightâ Him, by life's strain and stress Back-again-beaten from success, They strike blind: and among the out-of-sight For who has got to be, avails no might. The being praised outrageously Is grave, for at the eyes of such an one Is launched, from Zeus, the thunder-stone. Therefore do I decide For so much and no more prosperity Than of his envy passes unespied. Neither a city-sacker would I be, Nor life, myself by others captive, see. A swift report has gone our city through, From fire, the good-news messenger: if true, Who knows? Or is it not a god-sent lie? Who is so childish and deprived of sense That, having, at announcements of the flame Thus novel, felt his own heart fired thereby, He then shall at a change of evidence, Be worsted just the same? It is conspicuous in a woman's nature, Before its view to take a grace for granted: Too trustful,âon her boundary, usurpature Is swiftly made; But swiftly, too, decayed, The glory perishes by woman vaunted. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Soon shall we knowâof these light-bearing torches, And beacons and exchanges, fire with fireâ If they are true, indeed, or if, dream-fashion, This gladsome light came and deceived our judgment. Yon herald from the shore I see, o'ershadowed With boughs of olive: dust, mud's thirsty brother, Close neighbours on his garb, thus testify me That neither voiceless, nor yet kindling for thee Mountain-wood-flame, shall he explain by fire-smoke: But either tell out more the joyance, speaking . . . . Word contrary to which, I aught but love it! For may good beâto good that's knownâappendage! CHOROS. Whoever prays for aught else to this city âMay he himself reap fruit of his mind's error! HERALD. Ha, my forefathers' soil of earth Argeian! Thee, in this year's tenth light, am I returned toâ Of many broken hopes, on one hope chancing; For never prayed I, in this earth Argeian Dying, to share my part in tomb the dearest. Now, hail thou earth, and hail thou also, sunlight, And Zeus, the country's lord, and king the Puthian From bow no longer urging at us arrows! Enough, beside Skamandros, cam'st thou adverse: Now, contrary, be saviour thou and healer, O king Apollon! And gods conquest-granting, AllâI invoke too, and my tutelary Hermes, dear herald, heralds' veneration,â And Heroes our forthsenders,âfriendly, once more The army to receive, the war-spear's leavings! Ha, mansions of my monarchs, roofs beloved, And awful seats, and deities sun-frontingâ Receive with pomp your monarch, long time absent! For he comes bringing light in night-time to you, In common with all theseâking Agamemnon. But kindly greet himâfor clear shows your dutyâ Who has dug under Troia with the mattock Of Zeus the Avenger, whereby plains are out-ploughed, Altars unrecognizable, and gods' shrines, And the whole land's seed thoroughly has perished. And such a yoke-strap having cast round Troia, The elder king Atreides, happy manâhe Comes to be honoured, worthiest of what mortals Now are. Nor Paris nor the accomplice-city Outvaunts their deed as more than they are done-by: For, in a suit for rape and theft found guilty, He missed of plunder and, in one destruction, Fatherland, house and home has mowed to atoms: Debts the Priamidai have paid twice over. CHOROS. Hail, herald from the army of Achaians! HERALD. I hail:âto die, will gainsay gods no longer! CHOROS. Love of this fatherland did exercise thee? HERALD. So that I weep, at least, with joy, my eyes full. CHOROS. What, of this gracious sickness were ye gainers? HERALD. How now? instructed, I this speech shall master. CHOROS. For those who loved you back, with longing stricken. HERALD. This land yearned for the yearning army, say'st thou? CHOROS. So as to set me oft, from dark mind, groaning. HERALD. Whence came this ill mindâhatred to the army? CHOROS. Of old, I use, for mischief's physic, silence. HERALD. And how, the chiefs away, did you fear any? CHOROS. So that now,âlate thy word,âmuch joy wereâdying! HERALD. For well have things been worked out: these,âin much time, Some of them, one might say, had luck in falling, While some were faulty: since who, gods excepted, Goes, through the whole time of his life, ungrieving? For labours should I tell of, and bad lodgments, Narrow deckways ill-strewn, too,âwhat the day's woe We did not groan at getting for our portion? As for land-things, again, on went more hatred! Since beds were ours hard by the foemen's ramparts, And, out of heaven and from the earth, the meadow Dews kept a-sprinkle, an abiding damage Of vestures, making hair a wild-beast matting. Winter, too, if one told of itâbird-slayingâ Such as, unbearable, Idaian snow broughtâ Or heat, when waveless, on its noontide couches Without a wind, the sea would slumber falling âWhy must one mourn these? O'er and gone is labour: O'er and gone is it, even to those dead ones, So that no more again they mind uprising. Why must we tell in numbers those deprived ones, And the live man be vexed with fate's fresh outbreak? Rather, I bid full farewell to misfortunes! For us, the left from out the Argeian army, The gain beats, nor does sorrow counterbalance. So that 't is fitly boasted of, this sunlight, By us, o'er sea and land the aery flyers, âTroia at last taking, the band of Argives Hang up such trophies to the gods of Hellas Within their domesânew glory to grow ancient!â Such things men having heard must praise the city And army-leaders: and the grace which wrought themâ Of Zeus, shall honoured be. Thou hast my whole word. CHOROS. O'ercome by words, their sense I do not gainsay. For, aye this breeds youth in the oldââto learn well.â But these things most the house and Klutaimnestra Concern, 't is likely: while they make me rich, too. KLUTAIMNESTRA. I shouted long ago, indeed, for joyance, When came that first night-messenger of fire Proclaiming Ilion's capture and dispersion. And someone, girding me, said, âThrough fire-bearers PersuadedâTroia to be sacked now, thinkest? Truly, the woman's way,âhigh to lift heart up!â By such words I was made seem wit-bewildered: Yet still I sacrificed; and,âfemale-song with,â A shout one man and other, through the city, Set up, congratulating in the gods' seats, Soothing the incense-eating flame right fragrant. And now, what's more, indeed, why need'st thou tell me? I of the king himself shall learn the whole word: And,âas may best be,âI my revered husband Shall hasten, as he comes back, to receive: forâ What's to a wife sweeter to see than this light (Her husband, by the god saved, back from warfare) So as to open gates? This tell my husbandâ To come at soonest to his loving city. A faithful wife at home may he find, coming! Such an one as he leftâthe dog o' the householdâ Trusty to him, adverse to the ill-minded, And, in all else, the same: no signet-impress Having done harm to, in that time's duration. I know nor pleasure, nor blameworthy converse With any other man more thanâbronze-dippings! HERALD. Such boast as thisâbrimful of the veraciousâ Is, for a high-born dame, not bad to send forth! CHOROS. Ay, she spoke thus to theeâthat hast a knowledge From clear interpretersâa speech most seemly. But speak thou, herald! Meneleos I ask of: If he, returning, back in safety also Will come with youâthis land's beloved chieftain? HERALD. There's no way I might say things false and pleasant For friends to reap the fruits of through a long time. CHOROS. How then if, speaking good, things true thou chance on? HERALD. For not well-hidden things become they, sundered. The man has vanished from the Achaic army, He and his ship too. I announce no falsehood. CHOROS. Whether forth-putting openly from Ilion, Or did stormâwide woeâsnatch him from the army? HERALD. Like topping bowman, thou hast touched the target, And a long sorrow hast succinctly spoken. CHOROS. Whether, then, of him, as a live or dead man Was the report by other sailors bruited? HERALD. Nobody knows so as to tell out clearly Excepting Helios who sustains earth's nature. CHOROS. How say'st thou then, did storm the naval army Attack and end, by the celestials' anger? HERALD. It suits not to defile a day auspicious With ill-announcing speech: distinct each god's due: And when a messenger with gloomy visage To a city bears a fall'n host's woesâGod ward off!â One popular would that happens to the city, And many sacrificed from many householdsâ Men, scourged by that two-thonged whip Ares loves so, Double spear-headed curse, bloody yoke-couple,â Of woes like these, doubtless, whoe'er comes weighted, Him does it suit to sing the Erinues' paian. But who, of matters saved a glad-news-bringer, Comes to a city in good estate rejoicing. . . . How shall I mix good things with evil, telling Of storm against the Achaioi, urged by gods' wrath? For they swore league, being arch-foes before that, Fire and the sea: and plighted troth approved they, Destroying the unhappy Argeian army. At night began the bad-wave-outbreak evils; For, ships against each other Threkian breezes Shattered: and these, butted at in a fury By storm and typhoon, with surge rain-resounding,â Off they went, vanished, thro' a bad herd's whirling. And, when returned the brilliant light of Helios, We view the Aigaian sea on flower with corpses Of men Achaian and with naval ravage. But us indeed, and ship, unhurt i' the hull too, Either someone outstole us or outprayed usâ Some godâno man it was the tiller touching. And Fortune, saviour, willing on our ship sat. So as it neither had in harbour wave-surge Nor ran aground against a shore all rocky. And then, the water-Haides having fled from In the white day, not trusting to our fortune, We chewed the cud in thoughtsâthis novel sorrow O' the army labouring and badly pounded. And nowâif anyone of them is breathingâ They talk of us as having perished: why not? And weâthat they the same fate have, imagine. May it be for the best! Meneleos, then, Foremost and specially to come, expect thou! If (that is) any ray o' the sun reports him Living and seeing tooâby Zeus' contrivings, Not yet disposed to quite destroy the lineageâ Some hope is he shall come again to household. Having heard such things, know, thou truth art hearing! CHOROS. Who may he have been that named thus wholly with exactitudeâ (Was he someone whom we see not, by forecastings of the future Guiding tongue in happy mood?) âHer with battle for a bridegroom, on all sides contention-wooed, Helena? Sinceâmark the suture!â Ship's-Hell, Man's-Hell, City's-Hell, From the delicately-pompous curtains that pavilion well, Forth, by favour of the gale Of earth-born Zephuros did she sail. Many shield-bearers, leaders of the pack, Sailed too upon their track, Theirs who had directed oar, Then visible no more, To Simois' leaf-luxuriant shoreâ For sake of strife all gore! To Ilion Wrath, fulfilling her intent, This marriage-careâthe rightly named soâsent: In after-time, for the tables' abuse And that of the hearth-partaker Zeus, Bringing to punishment Those who honoured with noisy throat The honour of the bride, the hymenÃ¦al note Which did the kinsfolk then to singing urge. But, learning a new hymn for that which was, The ancient city of Priamos Groans probably a great and general dirge, Denominating Paris âThe man that miserably marries:ââ She who, all the while before, A life, that was a general dirge For citizens' unhappy slaughter, bore. And thus a man, by no milk's help, Within his household reared a lion's whelp That loved the teat In life's first festal stage: Gentle as yet, A true child-lover, and, to men of age, A thing whereat pride warms; And oft he had it in his arms Like any new-born babe, bright-faced, to hand Wagging its tail, at belly's strict command. But in due time upgrown, The custom of progenitors was shown: Forâthanks for sustenance repaying With ravage of sheep slaughteredâ It made unbidden feast; With blood the house was watered, To household came a woe there was no staying: Great mischief many-slaying! From God it wasâsome priest Of AtÃ©, in the house, by nurture thus increased. At first, then, to the city of Ilion went A soul, as I might say, of windless calmâ Wealth's quiet ornament, An eyes'-dart bearing balm, Love's spirit-biting flower. Butâfrom the true course bendingâ She brought about, of marriage, bitter ending: Ill-resident, ill-mate, in power Passing to the Priamidaiâby sending Of Hospitable Zeusâ Erinus for a bride,âto make brides mourn, her dower. Spoken long ago Was the ancient saying Still among mortals staying: âMan's great prosperity at height of rise Engenders offspring nor unchilded dies; And, from good fortune, to such families, Buds forth insatiate woe.â Whereas, distinct from any, Of my own mind I am: For 't is the unholy deed begets the many, Resembling each its dam. Of households that correctly estimate, Ever a beauteous child is born of Fate. But ancient Arrogance delights to generate Arrogance, young and strong mid mortals' sorrow, Or now, or then, when comes the appointed morrow. And she bears young Satiety; And, fiend with whom nor fight nor war can be, Unholy Daringâtwin black Curses Within the household, children like their nurses. But Justice shines in smoke-grimed habitations, And honours the well-omened life; While,âgold-besprinkled stations Where the hands' filth is rife, With backward-turning eyes Leaving,âto holy seats she hies, Not worshipping the power of wealth Stamped with applause by stealth: And to its end directs each thing begun. Approach then, my monarch, of Troia the sacker, of Atreus the son! How ought I address thee, how ought I revere thee,ânor yet overhitting Nor yet underbending the grace that is fitting? Many of mortals hasten to honour the seeming-to-beâ Passing by justice: and, with the ill-faring, to groan as he groans all are free. But no bite of the sorrow their liver has reached to: They say with the joyful,âone outside on each, too, As they force to a smile smileless faces. But whoever is good at distinguishing races In sheep of his flockâit is not for the eyes Of a man to escape such a shepherd's surprise, As they seem, from a well-wishing mind, In watery friendship to fawn and be kind. Thou to me, then, indeed, sending an army for Helena's sake, (I will not conceal it) wastâoh, by no help of the Muses!âdepicted Not well of thy midriff the rudder directing,âconvicted Of bringing a boldness they did not desire to the men with existence at stake. But nowâfrom no outside of mind, nor unlovinglyâgracious thou art To those who have ended the labour, fulfilling their part; And in time shalt thou know, by inquiry instructed, Who of citizens justly, and who not to purpose, the city conducted. AGAMEMNON. First, indeed, Argos, and the gods, the local, 'T is right addressingâthose with me the partners In this return and right things done the city Of Priamos: gods who, from no tongue hearing The rights o' the cause, for Ilion's fate man-slaught'rous Into the bloody vase, not oscillating, Put the vote-pebbles, while, o' the rival vessel, Hope rose up to the lip-edge: filled it was not. By smoke the captured city is still conspicuous: AtÃ©'s burnt offerings live: and, dying with them, The ash sends forth the fulsome blasts of riches. Of these things, to the gods grace many-mindful 'T is right I render, since both nets outrageous We built them round with, and, for sake of woman, It did the city to dustâthe Argeian monster, The horse's nestling, the shield-bearing people That made a leap, at setting of the Pleiads, And, vaulting o'er the tower, the raw-flesh-feeding Lion licked up his fill of blood tyrannic. I to the gods indeed prolonged this preface; Butâas for thy thought, I remember hearingâ I say the same, and thou co-pleader hast me. Since few of men this faculty is born withâ To honour, without grudge, their friend, successful. For moody, on the heart, a poison seated Its burthen doubles to who gained the sickness: By his own griefs he is himself made heavy, And out-of-door prosperity seeing groans at. Knowing, I'd call (for well have I experienced) âFellowship's mirror,â âphantom of a shadow,â Those seeming to be mighty gracious to me: While just Odusseusâhe who sailed not willingâ When joined on, was to me the ready trace-horse. This of him, whether dead or whether living, I say. For other city-and-gods' concernmentâ Appointing common courts, in full assemblage We will consult. And as for what holds seemlyâ How it may lasting stay well, must be counselled: While what has need of medicines Paionian We, either burning or else cutting kindly, Will make endeavour to turn pain from sickness. And now into the domes and homes by altar Going, I to the gods first raise the right-handâ They who, far sending, back again have brought me. And Victory, since she followed, fixed remain she! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Men, citizens, Argeians here, my worships! I shall not shame me, consort-loving manners To tell before you: for in time there dies off The diffidence from people. Not from others Learning, I of myself will tell the hard life I bore so long as this man was 'neath Ilion. First: for a woman, from the male divided, To sit at home alone, is monstrous evilâ Hearing the many rumours back-revenging: And for now This to come, now That bring after Woe, and still worse woe, bawling in the household! And truly, if so many wounds had chanced on My husband here, as homeward used to dribble Report, he's pierced more than a net to speak of! While, were he dying (as the words abounded) A triple-bodied Geruon the Second, Plenty aboveâfor loads below I count notâ Of earth a three-share cloak he'd boast of taking, Once only dying in each several figure! Because of suchlike rumours back-revenging, Many the halters from my neck, above head, Others than I loosedâloosed from neck by main force! From this cause, sure, the boy stands not beside meâ Possessor of our troth-plights, thine and mine tooâ As ought Orestes: be not thou astonished! For, him brings up our well-disposed guest-captive Strophios the Phokianâills that told on both sides To me predictingâboth of thee 'neath Ilion The danger, and if anarchy's mob-uproar Should overthrow thy council; since 't is born with Mortals,âwhoe'er has fallen, the more to kick him. Such an excuse, I think, no cunning carries! As for myselfâwhy, of my wails the rushing Fountains are dried up: not in them a drop more! And in my late-to-bed eyes I have damage, Bewailing what concerned thee, those torch-holdings For ever unattended to. In dreamsâwhy, Beneath the light wing-beats o' the gnat, I woke up As he went buzzingâsorrows that concerned thee Seeing, that filled more than their fellow-sleep-time. Now, all this having suffered, from soul grief-free I would style this man here the dog o' the stables, The saviour forestay of the ship, the high roof's Ground-prop, son sole-begotten to his father, âAy, land appearing to the sailors past hope, Loveliest day to see after a tempest, To the wayfaring-one athirst a well-spring, âThe joy, in short, of 'scaping all that'sâfatal! I judge him worth addresses such as these are âEnvy stand off!âfor many those old evils We underwent. And now, to meâdear headship!â Dismount thou from this car, not earthward setting The foot of thine, O king, that's Ilion's spoiler! Slave-maids, why tarry?âwhose the task allotted To strew the soil o' the road with carpet-spreadings. Immediately be purple-strewn the pathway, So that to home unhoped may lead himâJustice! As for the rest, care shallâby no sleep conqueredâ Dispose thingsâjustly (gods to aid!) appointed. AGAMEMNON. Offspring of Leda, of my household warder, Suitably to my absence hast thou spoken, For long the speech thou didst outstretch! But aptly To praiseâfrom others ought to go this favour. And for the rest,ânot me, in woman's fashion, Mollify, norâas mode of barbarous man isâ To me gape forth a groundward-falling clamour! Nor, strewing it with garments, make my passage Envied! Gods, sure, with these behoves we honour: But, for a mortal on these varied beauties To walkâto me, indeed, is nowise fear-free. I sayâas man, not god, to me do homage! Apart from foot-mats both and varied vestures, Renown is loud, andânot to lose one's senses, God's greatest gift. Behoves we him call happy Who has brought life to end in loved well-being. If all things I might manage thusâbrave man I! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Come now, this say, nor feign a feeling to me! AGAMEMNON. With feeling, know indeed, I do not tamper! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Vowed'st thou to the gods, in fear, to act thus? AGAMEMNON. If any, I well knew resolve I outspoke. KLUTAIMNESTRA. What think'st thou Priamos had done, thus victor? AGAMEMNON. On varied vestsâI do thinkâhe had passaged. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Then, do not, struck with awe at human censure. . . . AGAMEMNON. Well, popular mob-outcry much avails too. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Ay, but the unenvied is not the much valued. AGAMEMNON. Sure, 't is no woman's part to long for battle. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Why, to the prosperous, even suits a beating. AGAMEMNON. What? thou this beating us in war dost prize too? KLUTAIMNESTRA. Persuade thee! power, for once, grant meâand willing! AGAMEMNON. But if this seem so to theeâshoes, let someone Loose under, quickâfoot's serviceable carriage! And me, on these sea-products walking, may no Grudge from a distance, from the god's eye, strike at! For great shame were my strewment-spoilingâriches Spoiling with feet, and silver-purchased textures! Of these things, thus then. But this female-stranger Tenderly take inside! Who conquers mildly God, from afar, benignantly regardeth. For, willing, no one wears a yoke that's servile: And she, of many valuables, outpicked The flower, the army's gift, myself has followed. So,âsince to hear thee, I am brought about thus,â I go into the palaceâpurples treading. KLUTAIMNESTRA. There is the seaâand what man shall exhaust it?â Feeding much purple's worth-its-weight-in-silver Dye, ever fresh and fresh, our garments' tincture; At home, such wealth, king, we beginâby gods' helpâ With having, and to lack, the household knows not. Of many garments had I vowed a treading (In oracles if fore-enjoined the household) Of this dear soul the safe-return-price scheming! For, root existing, foliage goes up houses, O'erspreading shadow against Seirios dog-star; And, thou returning to the hearth domestic, Warmth, yea, in winter dost thou show returning. And when, too, Zeus works, from the green-grape acrid, Wineâthen, already, cool in houses comethâ The perfect man his home perambulating! Zeus, Zeus Perfecter, these my prayers perfect thou! Thy care beâyeaâof things thou mayst make perfect! CHOROS. Wherefore to me, this fearâ Groundedly stationed here Fronting my heart, the portent-watcherâflits she? Wherefore should prophet-play The uncalled and unpaid lay, Norâhaving spat forth fear, like bad dreamsâsits she On the mind's throne belovedâwell-suasive Boldness? For time, since, by a throw of all the hands, The boat's stern-cables touched the sands, Has past from youth to oldness,â When under Ilion rushed the ship-borne bands. And from my eyes I learnâ Being myself my witnessâtheir return. Yet, all the same, without a lyre, my soul, Itself its teacher too, chants from within Erinus' dirge, not having now the whole Of Hope's dear boldness: nor my inwards sinâ The heart that's rolled in whirls against the mind Justly presageful of a fate behind. But I prayâthings false, from my hope, may fall Into the fate that's not-fulfilled-at-all! Especially at least, of health that's great The term's insatiable: for, its weight âA neighbour, with a common wall betweenâ Ever will sickness lean; And destiny, her course pursuing straight, Has struck man's ship against a reef unseen. Now, when a portion, rather than the treasure, Fear casts from sling, with peril in right measure, It has not sunkâthe universal freight, (With misery freighted over-full) Nor has fear whelmed the hull. Then too the gift of Zeus, Two-handedly profuse, Even from the furrows' yield for yearly use Has done away with famine, the disease; But blood of man to earth once fallingâdeadly, blackâ In times ere these,â Who may, by singing spells, call back? Zeus had not else stopped one who rightly knew The way to bring the dead again. But, did not an appointed Fate constrain The Fate from gods, to bear no more than due, My heart, outstripping what tongue utters, Would have all out: which now, in darkness, mutters Moodily grieved, nor ever hopes to find How she a word in season may unwind From out the enkindling mind. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Take thyself in, thou tooâI say, Kassandra! Since Zeusânot angrilyâin household placed thee Partaker of hand-sprinklings, with the many Slaves stationed, his the Owner's altar close to. Descend from out this car, nor be high-minded! And truly they do say AlkmenÃ©'s child once Bore being sold, slaves' barley-bread his living. If, then, necessity of this lot o'erbalance, Much is the favour of old-wealthy masters: For those who, never hoping, made fine harvest Are harsh to slaves in all things, beyond measure. Thou hastâwith usâsuch usage as law warrants. CHOROS. To thee it was, she paused plain speech from speaking. Being inside the fatal netsâobeying, Thou mayst obey: but thou mayst disobey too! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Why, if she is not, in the swallow's fashion, Possessed of voice that's unknown and barbaric, I, with speechâspeaking in mind's scopeâpersuade her. CHOROS. Follow! The bestâas things now standâshe speaks of. Obey thou, leaving this thy car-enthronement! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Well, with this thing at door, for me no leisure To waste time: as concerns the hearth mid-navelled, Already stand the sheep for fireside slaying By those who never hoped to have such favour. If thou, then, aught of this wilt do, delay not! But if thou, being witless, tak'st no word in, Speak thou, instead of voice, with hand as Kars do! CHOROS. She seems a plain interpreter in need of, The stranger! and her wayâa beast's new-captured! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Why, she is mad, sure,âhears her own bad senses,â Who, while she comes, leaving a town new-captured, Yet knows not how to bear the bit o' the bridle Before she has out-frothed her bloody fierceness. Not Iâthrowing away more wordsâwill shamed be! CHOROS. But I,âfor I compassionate,âwill chafe not. Come, O unhappy one, this car vacating, Yielding to this necessity, prove yoke's use! KASSANDRA. Otototoi, Gods, Earth,â Apollon, Apollon! CHOROS. Why didst thou âototoiâ concerning Loxias? Since he is none such as to suit a mourner. KASSANDRA. Otototoi, Gods, Earth,â Apollon, Apollon! CHOROS. Ill-boding here again the god invokes she âNowise empowered in woes to stand by helpful. KASSANDRA. Apollon, Apollon, Guard of the ways, my destroyer! For thou hast quite, this second time, destroyed me. CHOROS. To prophesy she seems of her own evils: Remains the god-gift to the slave-soul present. KASSANDRA. Apollon, Apollon, Guard of the ways, my destroyer! Ha, whither hast thou led me? to what roof now? CHOROS. To the Atreidai's roof: if this thou know'st not, I tell it thee, nor this wilt thou call falsehood. KASSANDRA. How! How! God-hated, then! Of many a crime it knewâ Self-slaying evils, halters too: Man's-shambles, blood-besprinkler of the ground! CHOROS. She seems to be good-nosed, the stranger: dog-like, She snuffs indeed the victims she will find there. KASSANDRA. How! How! By the witnesses here I am certain now! These children bewailing their slaughtersâflesh dressed in the fire And devoured by their sire! CHOROS. Ay, we have heard of thy soothsaying glory, Doubtless: but prophets none are we in scent of! KASSANDRA. Ah, gods, what ever does she meditate? What this new anguish great? Great in the house here she meditates ill Such as friends cannot bear, cannot cure it: and still Off stands all Resistance Afar in the distance! CHOROS. Of these I witless amâthese prophesyings. But those I knew: for the whole city bruits them. KASSANDRA. Ah, unhappy one, this thou consummatest? Thy husband, thy bed's common guest, In the bath having brightened. . . How shall I declare Consummation? It soon will be there: For hand after hand she outstretches, At life as she reaches! CHOROS. Nor yet I've gone with thee! forâafter riddlesâ Now, in blind oracles, I feel resourceless. KASSANDRA. Eh, eh, papai, papai, What this, I espy? Some net of Haides undoubtedly Nay, rather, the snare Is she who has share In his bed, who takes part in the murder there! But may a revoltâ Unceasing assaultâ On the Race, raise a shout Sacrificial, about A victimâby stoningâ For murder atoning! CHOROS. What this Erinus which i' the house thou callest To raise her cry? Not me thy word enlightens! To my heart has run A drop of the crocus-dye: Which makes for those On earth by the spear that lie, A common close With life's descending sun. Swift is the curse begun! KASSANDRA. How! How! Seeâsee quick! Keep the bull from the cow! In the vesture she catching him, strikes him now With the black-horned trick, And he falls in the watery vase! Of the craft-killing cauldron I tell thee the case! CHOROS. I would not boast to be a topping critic Of oracles: but to some sort of evil I liken these. From oracles, what good speech To mortals, beside, is sent? It comes of their evils: these arts word-abounding that sing the event Bring the fear 't is their office to teach. KASSANDRA. Ah me, ah meâ Of me unhappy, evil-destined fortunes! For I bewail my proper woe As, mine with his, all into one I throw. Why hast thou hither me unhappy brought? âUnless that I should die with himâfor nought! What else was sought? CHOROS. Thou art some mind-mazed creature, god-possessed: And all about thyself dost wail A layâno lay! Like some brown nightingale Insatiable of noise, whoâwell-away!â From her unhappy breast Keeps moaning Itus, Itus, and his life With evils, flourishing on each side, rife. KASSANDRA. Ah me, ah me, The fate o' the nightingale, the clear resounder! For a body wing-borne have the gods cast round her, And sweet existence, from misfortunes free: But for myself remains a sundering With spear, the two-edged thing! CHOROS. Whence hast thou this on-rushing god-involving pain And spasms in vain? For, things that terrify, With changing unintelligible cry Thou strikest up in tune, yet all the while After that Orthian style! Whence hast thou limits to the oracular road, That evils bode? KASSANDRA. Ah me, the nuptials, the nuptials of Paris, the deadly to friends! Ah me, of Skamandros the draught Paternal! There once, to these ends, On thy banks was I brought, The unhappy! And now, by Kokutos and Acheron's shore I shall soon be, it seems, these my oracles singing once more! CHOROS. Why this word, plain too much, Hast thou uttered? A babe might learn of such! I am struck with a bloody biteâhere underâ At the fate woe-wreaking Of thee shrill shrieking: To me who hearâa wonder! KASSANDRA. Ah me, the toilsâthe toils of the city The wholly destroyed: ah, pity, Of the sacrificings my father made In the ramparts' aidâ Much slaughter of grass-fed flocksâthat afforded no cure That the city should not, as it does now, the burthen endure! But I, with the soul on fire, Soon to the earth shall cast me and expire. CHOROS. To things, on the former consequent, Again hast thou given vent: And 't is some evil-meaning fiend doth move thee, Heavily falling from above thee, To melodize thy sorrowsâelse, in singing, Calamitous, death-bringing! And of all this the end I am without resource to apprehend KASSANDRA. Well then, the oracle from veils no longer Shall be outlooking, like a bride new-married: But bright it seems, against the sun's uprisings Breathing, to penetrate thee: so as, wave-like, To wash against the rays a woe much greater Than this. I will no longer teach by riddles. And witness, running with me, that of evils Done long ago, I nosing track the footstep! For, this same roof hereânever quits a Choros One-voiced, not well-tuned since no âwellâ it utters: And truly having drunk, to get more courage, Man's bloodâthe Komos keeps within the household âHard to be sent outsideâof sister Furies: They hymn their hymnâwithin the house close sittingâ The first beginning curse: in turn spit forth at The Brother's bed, to him who spurned it hostile. Have I missed aught, or hit I like a bowman? False prophet am I,âknock at doors, a babbler? Henceforward witness, swearing now, I know not By other's word the old sins of this household! CHOROS. And how should oath, bond honourably binding, Become thy cure? No less I wonder at thee âThat thou, beyond sea reared, a strange-tongued city Shouldst hit in speaking, just as if thou stood'st by! KASSANDRA. Prophet Apollon put me in this office. CHOROS. What, even though a god, with longing smitten? KASSANDRA. At first, indeed, shame was to me to say this. CHOROS. For, more relaxed grows everyone who fares well. KASSANDRA. But he was athlete to meâhuge grace breathing! CHOROS. Well, to the work of children, went ye law's way? KASSANDRA. Having consented, I played false to Loxias. CHOROS. Already when the wits inspired possessed of? KASSANDRA. Already townsmen all their woes I foretold. CHOROS. How wast thou then unhurt by Loxias' anger? KASSANDRA. I no one aught persuaded, when I sinned thus. CHOROS. To us, at least, now sooth to say thou seemest. KASSANDRA. Halloo, halloo, ah, evils! Again, straightforward foresight's fearful labour Whirls me, distracting with prelusive last-lays! Behold ye those there, in the household seated,â Young ones,âof dreams approaching to the figures? Children, as if they died by their belovedsâ Hands they have filled with flesh, the meal domesticâ Entrails and vitals both, most piteous burthen, Plain they are holding!âwhich their father tasted! For this, I say, plans punishment a certain Lion ignoble, on the bed that wallows, House-guard (ah, me!) to the returning master âMine, since to bear the slavish yoke behoves me! The ship's commander, Ilion's desolator, Knows not what things the tongue of the lewd she-dog Speaking, outspreading, shiny-souled, in fashion Of AtÃ© hid, will reach to, by ill fortune! Such things she daresâthe female, the male's slayer! She is . . . how calling her the hateful bite-beast May I hit the mark? Some amphisbaina,âSkulla Housing in rocks, of mariners the mischief, Revelling Haides' mother,âcurse, no truce with, Breathing at friends! How piously she shouted, The all-courageous, as at turn of battle! She seems to joy at the back-bringing safety! Of this, too, if I nought persuade, all's one! Why? What is to be will come. And soon thou, present, âTrue prophet all too muchâ wilt pitying style me. CHOROS. Thuestes' feast, indeed, on flesh of children, I went with, and I shuddered. Fear too holds me Listing what's true as life, nowise out-imaged. KASSANDRA. I say, thou Agamemnon's fate shalt look on. CHOROS. Speak good words, O unhappy! Set mouth sleeping! KASSANDRA. But Paian stands in no stead to the speech here. CHOROS. Nay, if the thing be near: but never be it! KASSANDRA. Thou, indeed, prayest: they to kill are busy. CHOROS. Of what man is it ministered, this sorrow? KASSANDRA. There again, wide thou look'st of my foretellings. CHOROS. For, the fulfiller's scheme I have not gone with. KASSANDRA. And yet too well I know the speech Hellenic. CHOROS. For Puthian oracles, thy speech, and hard too. KASSANDRA. Papai: what fire this! and it comes upon me! Ototoi, Lukeion Apollon, ah meâme! She, the two-footed lioness that sleeps with The wolf, in absence of the generous lion, Kills me the unhappy one: and as a poison Brewing, to put my price too in the anger, She vows, against her mate this weapon whetting To pay him back the bringing me, with slaughter. Why keep I then these things to make me laughed at, Both wands and, round my neck, oracular fillets? Thee, at least, ere my own fate will I ruin: Go, to perdition falling! Boons exchange weâ Some other AtÃ© in my stead make wealthy! See thereâhimself, Apollon stripping from me The oracular garment! having looked upon me âEven in these adornments, laughed by friends at, As good as foes, i' the balance weighed: and vainlyâ For, called crazed stroller,âas I had been gipsy, Beggar, unhappy, starved to death,âI bore it. And now the Prophetâprophet me undoing, Has led away to these so deadly fortunes! Instead of my sire's altar, waits the hack-block She struck with first warm bloody sacrificing! Yet nowise unavenged of gods will death be: For there shall come another, our avenger, The mother-slaying scion, father's doomsman: Fugitive, wanderer, from this land an exile, Back shall he come,âfor friends, copestone these curses! For there is sworn a great oath from the gods that Him shall bring hither his fallen sire's prostration. Why make I then, like an indweller, moaning? Since at the first I foresaw Ilion's city Suffering as it has suffered: and who took it, Thus by the judgment of the gods are faring. I go, will suffer, will submit to dying! But, Haides' gatesâthese same I call, I speak to, And pray that on an opportune blow chancing, Without a struggle,âblood the calm death bringing In easy outflow,âI this eye may close up! CHOROS. O much unhappy, but, again, much learned Woman, long hast thou outstretched! But if truly Thou knowest thine own fate, how comes that, like to A god-led steer, to altar bold thou treadest? KASSANDRA. There's no avodiance,âstrangers, no some time more! CHOROS. He last is, anyhow, by time advantaged. KASSANDRA. It comes, the day: I shall by flight gain little. CHOROS. But know thou patient art from thy brave spirit! KASSANDRA. Such things hears no one of the happy-fortuned. CHOROS. But gloriously to dieâfor man is grace, sure. KASSANDRA. Ah, sire, for thee and for thy noble children! CHOROS. But what thing is it? What fear turns thee backwards? KASSANDRA. Alas, alas! CHOROS. Why this âAlas!â if 't is no spirit's loathing? KASSANDRA. Slaughter blood-dripping does the household smell of! CHOROS. How else? This scent is of hearth-sacrifices. KASSANDRA. Such kind of steam as from a tomb is proper! CHOROS. No Surian honour to the House thou speak'st of! KASSANDRA. But I will go,âeven in the household wailing My fate and Agamemnon's. Life suffice me! Ah, strangers! I cry not âahââas bird at bushâthrough terror Idly! to me, the dead this much bear witness: When, for meâwoman, there shall die a woman, And, for a man ill-wived, a man shall perish! This hospitality I ask as dying. CHOROS. O sufferer, theeâthy foretold fate I pity. KASSANDRA. Yet once for all, to speak a speech, I fain am: No dirge, mine for myself! The sun I pray to, Fronting his last light!âto my own avengersâ That from my hateful slayers they exact too Pay for the dead slaveâeasy-managed hand's work! CHOROS. Alas for mortal matters! Happy-fortuned,â Why, any shade would turn them: if unhappy, By throws the wetting sponge has spoiled the picture! And more by much in mortals this I pity. The being well-to-doâ Insatiate a desire of this Born with all mortals is, Nor any is there who Well-being forces off, aroints From roofs whereat a finger points, âNo more come in!â exclaiming. This man, too, To take the city of Priamos did the celestials give, And, honoured by the god, he homeward comes; But now if, of the former, he shall pay The blood back, and, for those who ceased to live, Dying, for deaths in turn new punishment he doomsâ Who, being mortal, would not pray With an unmischievous Daimon to have been bornâwho would not, hearing thus? AGAMEMNON. Ah me! I am struckâa right-aimed stroke within me! CHOROS. Silence! Who is it shouts âstrokeâââright-aimedlyâ a wounded one? AGAMEMNON. Ah me! indeed again,âa second, struck by! CHOROS. This work seems to me completed by this âAh meâ of the king's; But we somehow may together share in solid counsellings. CHOROS 1. I, in the first place, my opinion tell you: âTo cite the townsmen, by help-cry, to house here. CHOROS 2. To me, it seems we ought to fall upon them At quickestâprove the fact by sword fresh-flowing! CHOROS 3. And I, of such opinion the partaker, Voteâto do something: not to waitâthe main point! CHOROS 4. 'T is plain to see: for they prelude as though of A tyranny the signs they gave the city. CHOROS 5. For we waste time; while they,âthis waiting's glory Treading to ground,âallow the hand no slumber. CHOROS 6. I know notâchancing on some planâto tell it: 'T is for the doer to plan of the deed also. CHOROS 7. And I am such another: since I'm schemeless How to raise up again by wordsâa dead man! CHOROS 8. What, and, protracting life, shall we give way thus To the disgracers of our home, these rulers? CHOROS 9. Why, 't is unbearable: but to die is better: For death than tyranny is the riper finish! CHOROS 10. What, by the testifying âAh meâ of him, Shall we prognosticate the man as perished? CHOROS 11. We must quite know ere speak these things concerning: For to conjecture and âquite knowâ are two things. CHOROS 12. This same to praise I from all sides abound inâ Clearly to knowâAtreides, what he's doing! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Much having been before to purpose spoken, The opposite to say I shall not shamed be: For how should one, to enemies,âin semblance, Friends,âenmity proposing,âsorrow's net-frame Enclose, a height superior to outleaping? To me, indeed, this struggle of oldânot mindless Of an old victoryâcame: with time, I grant you! I stand where I have struck, things once accomplished: And so have done,âand this deny I shall not,â As that his fate was nor to fly nor ward off. A wrap-round with no outlet, as for fishes, I fence about himâthe rich woe of the garment: I strike him twice, and in a double âAh-me!â He let his limbs goâthere! And to him, fallen, The third blow add I, givingâof Below ground Zeus, guardian of the deadâthe votive favour. Thus in the mind of him he rages, falling, And blowing forth a brisk blood-spatter, strikes me With the dark drop of slaughterous dewârejoicing No less than, at the god-given dewy-comfort, The sown-stuff in its birth-throes from the calyx. Since so these things are,âArgives, my revered here,â Ye may rejoiceâif ye rejoice: but Iâboast! If it were fit on corpse to pour libation, That would be rightâright over and above, too! The cup of evils in the house he, having Filled with such curses, himself coming drinks of. CHOROS. We wonder at thy tongue: since bold-mouthed truly Is she who in such speech boasts o'er her husband! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Ye test me as I were a witless woman: But Iâwith heart intrepidâto you knowers Say (and thouâif thou wilt or praise or blame me, Comes to the same)âthis man is Agamemnon, My husband, dead, the work of the right hand here, Ay, of a just artificer: so things are. CHOROS. What evil, O woman, food or drink, earth-bred Or sent from the flowing sea, Of such having fed Didst thou set on thee This sacrifice And popular cries Of a curse on thy head? Off thou hast thrown him, off hast cut The man from the city: butâ Off from the city thyself shalt be Cutâto the citizens A hate immense! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Now, indeed, thou adjudgest exile to me, And citizens' hate, and to have popular curses: Nothing of this against the man here bringing, Who, no more awe-checked than as 't were a beast's fate,â With sheep abundant in the well-fleeced graze-flocks,â Sacrificed his child,âdearest fruit of travail To me,âas song-spell against Threkian blowings. Not him did it behove thee hence to banish âPollution's penalty? But hearing my deeds Justicer rough thou art! Now, this I tell thee: To threaten thusâme, one prepared to have thee (On like conditions, thy hand conquering) o'er me Rule: but if God the opposite ordain us, Thou shalt learnâlate taught, certesâto be modest. CHOROS. Greatly-intending thou art: Much-mindful, too, hast thou cried (Since thy mind, with its slaughter-outpouring part, Is frantic) that over the eyes, a patch Of bloodâwith blood to matchâ Is plain for a pride! Yet still, bereft of friends, thy fate Isâblow with blow to expiate! KLUTAIMNESTRA. And this thou hearestâof my oaths, just warrant! By who fulfilled things for my daughter, Justice, Ate, Erinus,âby whose help I slew him,â Not mine the fancyâFear will tread my palace So long as on my hearth there burns a fire, Aigisthos as before well-caring for me; Since he to me is shield, no small, of boldness. Here does he lieâoutrager of this female, Dainty of all the Chruseids under Ilion; And sheâthe captive, the soothsayer also And couchmate of this man, oracle-speaker, Faithful bed-fellow,âay, the sailors' benches They wore in common, nor unpunished did so, Since he isâthus! While, as for her,âswan-fashion, Her latest having chanted,âdying wailing She lies,âto him, a sweetheart: me she brought toâ My bed's by-nicety-the whet of dalliance. CHOROS. Alas, that some Fate would come Upon us in quicknessâ Neither much sickness Neither bed-keepingâ And bear unended sleeping, Now that subdued Is our keeper, the kindest of mood! Having borne, for a woman's sake, much strifeâ By a woman he withered from life! Ah me! Law-breaking Helena who, one, Hast many, so many souls undone 'Neath Troia! and now the consummated Much-memorable curse Hast thou made flower-forth, red With the blood no rains disperse, That which was then in the Houseâ Strife all-subduing, the woe of a spouse. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Nowise, of death the fateâ Burdened by these thingsâsupplicate! Nor on Helena turn thy wrath As the man-destroyer, as âshe who hath, Being but one, Many and many a soul undone Of the men, the Danaoiââ And wrought immense annoy! CHOROS. Daimon, who fallest Upon this household and the double-raced Tantalidai, a rule, minded like theirs displaced, Thou rulest me with, now, Whose heart thou gallest! And on the body, like a hateful crow, Stationed, all out of tune, his chant to chant Doth Something vaunt! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Now, of a truth, hast thou set upright Thy mouth's opinion,â Naming the Sprite, The triply gross, O'er the race that has dominion: For through him it is that Eros The carnage-licker In the belly is bred: ere ended quite Is the elder throeânew ichor! CHOROS. Certainly, great of might And heavy of wrath, the Sprite Thou tellest of, in the palace (Woe, woe!) âAn evil tale of a fate By AtÃ©'s malice Rendered insatiate! Oh, oh,â King, king, how shall I beweep thee? From friendly soul whatever say? Thou liest where webs of the spider o'ersweep thee In impious death, life breathing away. O meâme! This couch, not free. By a slavish death subdued thou art, From the hand, by the two-edged dart. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Thou boastest this deed to be mine: But leave off styling me âThe Agamemnonian wife!â For, showing himself in sign Of the spouse of the corpse thou dost see, Did the ancient bitter avenging-ghost Of Atreus, savage host, Pay the man here as priceâ A full-grown for the young one's sacrifice. CHOROS. That no cause, indeed, of this killing art thou, Who shall be witness-bearer? How shall he bear itâhow? But the sire's avenging-ghost might be in the deed a sharer. He is forced on and on By the kin-born flowing of blood, âBlack Ares: to where, having gone, He shall leave off, flowing done, At the frozen-child's-flesh food. King, king, how shall I beweep thee? From friendly soul whatever say? Thou liest where webs of the spider o'ersweep thee In impious death, life breathing away. O meâme! This couch, not free! By a slavish death subdued thou art, From the hand, by the two-edged dart. KLUTAIMNESTRA. No death âunfit for the freeâ Do I think this man's to be: For did not himself a slavish curse To his household decree? But the scion of him, myself did nurseâ That much-bewailed Iphigeneia, he Having done well by,âand as well, nor worse, Been done to,âlet him not in Haides loudly Bear himself proudly! Being by sword-destroying death amerced For that sword's punishment himself inflicted first. CHOROS. I at a loss am leftâ Of a feasible scheme of mind bereftâ Where I may turn: for the house is falling: I fear the bloody crash of the rain That ruins the roof as it bursts amain: The warning-drop Has come to a stop. Destiny doth Justice whet For other deed of hurt, on other whetstones yet. Woe, earth, earthâwould thou hadst taken me Ere I saw the man I see, On the pallet-bed Of the silver-sided bath-vase, dead! Who is it shall bury him, who Sing his dirge? Can it be true That thou wilt dare this same to doâ Having slain thy husband, thine own, To make his funeral moan: And for the soul of him, in place Of his mighty deeds, a graceless grace To wickedly institute? By whom Shall the tale of praise o'er the tomb At the god-like man be sentâ From the truth of his mind as he toils intent? KLUTAIMNESTRA. It belongs not to thee to declare This object of care! By us did he fallâdown there! Did he dieâdown there! and down, no less, We will bury him there, and not beneath The wails of the household over his death: But Iphigeneia,âwith kindliness,â His daughter,âas the case requires, Facing him full, at the rapid-flowing Passage of Groans shallâboth hands throwing Around himâkiss that kindest of sires! CHOROS. This blame comes in the place of blame: Hard battle it is to judge each claim. âHe is borne away who bears away: And the killer has all to pay.â And this remains while Zeus is remaining, âThe doer shall suffer in timeââfor, such his ordaining. Who may cast out of the House its cursed brood? The race is to AtÃ© glued! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Thou hast gone into this oracle With a true result. For me, then,âI will âTo the Daimon of the Pleisthenidai Making an oathâwith all these things comply Hard as they are to bear. For the restâ Going from out this House, a guest, May he wear some other family To nought, with the deaths of kin by kin! And,âkeeping a little part of my goods,â Wholly am I contented in Having expelled from the royal House These frenzied moods The mutually-murderous. AIGISTHOS. O light propitious of day justice-bringing! I may say truly, now, that men's avengers, The gods from high, of earth behold the sorrowsâ Seeing, as I have, i' the spun robes of the Erinues, This man here lying,âsight to me how pleasant!â His father's hands' contrivances repaying. For Atreus, this land's lord, of this man father, Thuestes, my own fatherâto speak clearlyâ His brother too,âbeing i' the rule contested,â Drove forth to exile from both town and household: And, coming back, to the hearth turned, a suppliant, Wretched Thuestes found the fate assured him âNot to die, bloodying his paternal threshold Just there: but host-wise this man's impious father Atreus, soul-keenly more than kindly,âseeming To joyous hold a flesh-day,âto my father Served up a meal, the flesh of his own children. The feet indeed and the hands' top divisions He hid, high up and isolated sitting: But, their unshowing parts in ignorance taking, He forthwith eats foodâas thou seestâperdition To the race: and then, 'ware of the deed ill-omened, He shrieked O!âfalls back, vomiting, from the carnage, And fate on the Pelopidai past bearing He prays downâputting in his curse together The kicking down o' the feastâthat so might perish The race of Pleisthenes entire: and thence is That it is given thee to see this man prostrate. And I was rightly of this slaughter stitch-man: Since me,âbeing third from ten,âwith my poor father He drives outâbeing then a babe in swathe-bands: But, grown up, back again has justice brought me: And of this man I got holdâbeing without-doorsâ Fitting together the whole scheme of ill-will. So, sweet, in fine, even to die were to me, Seeing, as I have, this man i' the toils of justice! CHOROS. Aigisthos, arrogance in ills I love not. Dost thou sayâwilling, thou didst kill the man here, And, alone, plot this lamentable slaughter? I sayâthy head in justice will escape not The people's throwingâknow that!âstones and curses! AIGISTHOS. Thou such things soundestâseated at the lower Oarage to those who rule at the ship's mid-bench? Thou shalt know, being old, how heavy is teaching To one of the like ageâbidden be modest! But chains and old age and the pangs of fasting Stand out before all else in teaching,âprophets At souls'-cure! Dost not, seeing aught, see this too? Against goads kick not, lest tript-up thou suffer! CHOROS. Woman, thou,âof him coming new from battle Houseguardâthy husband's bed the while disgracing,â For the Army-leader didst thou plan this fate too? AIGISTHOS. These words too are of groans the prime-begetters! Truly a tongue opposed to Orpheus hast thou: For he led all things by his voice's grace-charm, But thou, upstirring them by these wild yelpings, Wilt lead them! Forced, thou wilt appear the tamer! CHOROS. Soâthou shalt be my king then of the Argeiansâ Who, not when for this man his fate thou plannedst, Daredst to do this deedâthyself the slayer! AIGISTHOS. For, to deceive him was the wife's part, certes: I was looked afterâfoe, ay, old-begotten! But out of this man's wealth will I endeavour To rule the citizens: and the no-man-minder âHim will I heavily yokeâby no means trace-horse, A corned-up colt! but that bad friend in darkness, Famine its housemate, shall behold him gentle. CHOROS. Why then, this man here, from a coward spirit, Didst not thou slay thyself? But,âhelped,âa woman, The country's pest, and that of gods o' the country, Killed him! Orestes, where may he see light now? That coming hither back, with gracious fortune, Of both these he may be the all-conquering slayer? AIGISTHOS. But since this to do thou thinkestâand not talkâthou soon shalt know! Up then, comrades dear! the proper thing to doânot distant this! CHOROS. Up then! hilt in hold, his sword let everyone aright dispose! AIGISTHOS. Ay, but I myself too, hilt in hold, do not refuse to die. CHOROS. Thou wilt die, thou say'st, to who accept it. We the chance demand. KLUTAIMNESTRA. Nowise, O belovedest of men, may we do other ills! To have reaped away these, even, is a harvest much to me. Go, both thou and these the old men, to the homes appointed each, Ere ye suffer! It behoved one do these things just as we did: And if of these troubles there should be enoughâwe may assent âBy the Daimon's heavy heel unfortunately stricken ones! So a woman's counsel hath itâif one judge it learning-worth. AIGISTHOS. But to think that these at me the idle tongue should thus o'erbloom, And throw out such wordsâthe Daimon's power experimenting onâ And, of modest knowledge missing,âme, the ruler, . . . CHOROS. Ne'er may this befall Argeiansâwicked man to fawn before! AIGISTHOS. Anyhow, in after days, will I, yes, I, be at thee yet! CHOROS. Not if hither should the Daimon make Orestes straightway come! AIGISTHOS. O, I know, myself, that fugitives on hopes are pasturefed! CHOROS. Do thy deed, get fat, defiling justice, since the power is thine! AIGISTHOS. Know that thou shalt give me satisfaction for this folly's sake! CHOROS. Boast on, bearing thee audacious, like a cock his females by! KLUTAIMNESTRA. Have not thou respect for these same idle yelpings! I and thou Will arrange it, o'er this household ruling excellently well.</field>
