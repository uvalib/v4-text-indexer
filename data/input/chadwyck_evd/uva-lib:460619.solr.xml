      <field name="fulltext">PRELUDE [Midnight. A broad parapet, outside the Royal Palace of Linlithgow, on to which James emerges, while Music is being played, and the sound of gay laughter is heard, within. At the open windows, the faces of Ladies at the King's Court appear and disappear.] JAMES Good night, fair ladies all! Truce to your charms! Warm dreams, sound sleep! But, as you know, in France They say the silent recollected Night Brings counsel sage, and I have need of it. So let the music of your laughter and Soft-shading eyelids see you to your beds. But, as you go, be measured in your mirth; Wake not the Queen! Good night! Good night! Good night! [He walks slowly along the parapet. Shortly, as he turns, he beholds a veiled Apparition.] Who mayst thou be? APPARITION The Wisdom of the Night, Whom you invoked! Go not to war with England! Or if the hotness of your blood demand That sanguinary ordeal, beware, Beware of woman's glamour, woman's wiles! JAMES Now I'll be sworn that this is merely one Of England's crafty emissaries, or Some frolic beauty of my Court, dispatched To play upon my fancy some fresh trick. Well, if the first, my sword shall probe the riddle; And, if the second, she the forfeit pay Of such nocturnal visitants. [He draws his sword, and prepares to thrust at the Apparition. It stalks slowly towards him, walks upon his sword point, against him, through him, and vanishes.] Gone! [He turns to see if it be behind, but there is no one, and the last lights in the Castle are extinguished.] Gone!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I SCENE:âGallery at Ford Castle (Seneschal. Margery) [Margery arranging fresh-plucked roses in the Gallery. Seneschal gazing out of the window in the raised embrasure.] MARGERY Roses are in September yet more sweet Than in the lavish loveliness of June, And by us are more fondly cherishÃ«d; Loved guests that are about to go away When we would have them linger; fading friends, Our love for whom we do but half surmise Until the grave imperiously claims They be to it surrendered. My lady loves Autumnal flowers, albeit herself she be Still in the heyday of her Summer beauty, And these for her were gathered. There! And there! [Mounting the steps of the embrasure.] Oh! will the fight be fought as near as that? I see the armies plain, the camps astir! I almost hear their voices! SENESCHAL Goodly sight, Bravest of earthly shows! It makes one fancy Oneself a boy again, to look on it; Thaws the congealing blood, loosens stiff joints, And feeds afresh the flickering flame of life. When I was young, the sword was rarely sheathed, The spears were never stacked! War, always war, Along the joyous Border! MARGERY Death too, death, Ever in ambush! SENESCHAL Have we not all to die? I have known men who, lingering at fourscore, Had never lived an hour, and youths that died In the full summer sunshine of their days, But they had flowered continuously through The season of the hawthorn and the rose, And Autumn never seared their manly beauty, Nor Winter piled its snow upon their hearts. They lived still fightingâfighting still they died. There's nothing like it, though perchance you deem That Love is sweeter. MARGERY So in truth I do, Or, rather, think I should, did I but know it. SENESCHAL I warrant me you know it well, and now Nature from you her secret not withholds, Though 'tis more maidenly you should not own it. Viewing me now, mere winter of a man, You well may find it full as hard to think I ever loved as that I ever fought. Yet, Margery, on my soul, I have done both, And War was sweeter even than was Love, Though Love itself's a sort of warfare too, Wherein the boldest wins. MARGERY Is that quite so? I have been told, in love the weakest wins, The weakest, and the gentlest. SENESCHAL Think so, then. But the sound sleep under the silent stars, The clamour, the bright bustle of the dawn, The doubt, the dangers, the delights of warâ Gone, all of them gone, for me at least, who now Will never know them more! Of recent years, Our English Henry, Seventh of the name, Though grandson of gay Hal of Agincourt, Was all for peace with Scotland, and thereto Married his daughter Margaret to King James. But now that a young Harry, warm in blood, And proud and mettlesome as James himself, Who were to-day at Flodden but he is Afoot for fame in battle-fields of France, Sits on the English throne, these gamesome kings, Like two-year cockerels with their steel spurs on, Claw at each other. MARGERY But the pretext, what? There must be some pretence. SENESCHAL A woman, Margery, As it has ever been since Troy Town fell. Leastways, a woman's jewels, Margaret's, Her brother will not yield until some wrong, In which Sir William Heron was mixed up And captive seized, be righted by King James. MARGERY When think you that the battle will be fought? SENESCHAL (after stiffly ascending and descending the steps of the large embrasure) See! here comes one more like to know than I. MARGERY Who may that be? SENESCHAL One we all know right well, The warmest yeoman on the lands of Ford, Young Donald Grey, the Captain of the Troop, And armed as though for martial purposes. [Enter Donald] DONALD Homage to Mistress Margery, and to you, All the respect youth pays to worth and age. SENESCHAL What tidings, Donald? DONALD Right brave ones, sir. All those I notified, Muster in force, in honest clansmen gear, Accoutred in their best, a hundred strong, Stripling and adult, very flower of Ford. [Exit Seneschal.] MARGERY Shall I not tell my lady you are here? DONALD I pray you, of your graciousness. Yet stay One moment, if you will. There was a word, A little word, I fain would say to you. Forgive me if I seem to have forgotten it. MARGERY Then will I unto Lady Heron; meanwhile It may come back to you. DONALD Nay, go not yet! Yes, this it was: a bold yet halting word, The oldest, freshest, biggest in the world, That chokes the broadest-chested man alive. I love you, Margery! Since that still night When we 'chance met and wandered 'neath the stars, That seemed to shine in Heaven but with your eyes, And the husht woodlands listening to your voice, I hear no other name, but only yours. The very faintest breath that stirs the leaves Still whispers âMargery! Margery!â Every stream That sings its way adown to Till or Tweed Trebles and carols âMargery!â Can it be That Nature thuswise would seduce my ears, But to bewray my heart? Tell me it doth not! MARGERY How can I know? Yet, since that star-crowned night, When your voice trembled, and my soul replied, I long for something, something! Is it you? DONALD It is, or, if 'tis not, it needs must be. Let us put it to the test, and you will learn. [Embraces her.] MARGERY Oh, 'tis too sudden! And the fight! the fight!â May be you go to death, and then the life Of her whom thus you have betrothed for yours, Would have to wear unwedded widowhood. DONALD Your love will charm aside the threat of death, And see me safely through the riskiest fray. Love makes a man, who is verily a man, Active in peace and valorous in war, Too confidently knit to fail or fall. Make me yet stronger! MARGERY But you must not fall, Nor court exceeding danger overmuch. DONALD Yea, that I must, and shall. For Love deprives Danger of danger, frightens fear away. And I would win you, having helped to win Victory for Surrey and the English Cause. Tears! Are these tears? MARGERY 'Tis but an April shower, That brings the martlet to the cottage eave, Blade to the grass, and leaf unto the bough, And wakens every note of pairing joy In garth and brake. DONALD Be mine, then, like the sun, To smile, and kiss the glittering drops away! See! Harvest ripens in the Autumn fields, In this still rounding world. But young Love is A Springtime in itself, and in my heart I feel its blossoms, O, too long kept back, Unfolding fearlessly. MARGERY Yet let us, Donald, Prolong their loitering, lest samesome Summer Shorten Love's sweetest season! DONALD But remember I have a nest all ready for you, dear, Only awaiting to be warmed by you, When I will tend on you, and hourly bring All that Love needs for brooding happiness. MARGERY Forbear! Forbear! or tears will rain afresh! What do men say of Surrey? DONALD That he needs Like centuried oak, an amplitude of space To manifest his greatness. That he hath The stoutest heart and strongest will alive, And under him to serve the entrance is To honour and distinction. MARGERY Yes! and you Are Head and Captain of the Troop of Ford. DONALD Yes, by their generous choice, so must I hence Unwillingly, and but at Duty's call, To muster them within the Castle Court, Where, ere they march, they trust that Lady Heron, Her lord away, will speed them to the fight. MARGERY As so she will, I doubt not. I, meanwhile, Her grateful ward, will sue to her and beg Her sanction to ourâ DONALD Love and Marriage-bond. But, ere we part, troth we our love anew! [They embrace. Exit Donald, Margery accompanying him to the door, and, as she closes it, and turns, Enter Lady Heron.] LADY HERON Round but the hour, and then He will be here! MARGERY He? Who? The King? LADY HERON The King! My more than King, My towering Warrior, Hero, Conqueror, Man, My birthright-sceptred Surrey! He will come, Afresh red-hot from battle to my arms, Martial voluptuary, his victor blade Crimsoned with routed blood up to the hilt, His face ablaze with slaughter, and his breast, Like hammer upon anvil, beat on mine In Love's own furnace. MARGERY Oh, hush, hush! Or, though I love you gratefully, as should The orphan you have mothered from her birth, You can I serve no more, for those are words Neither for you to utter, nor me to hear. LADY HERON Then hide within a nunnery, though even there I have heard the vestal flame will overburn, Fluttered by Nature, the incendiary, And underneath the wimple woman's heart Betray its straight descent from Lucifer. MARGERY How wildly you do ravin among words, Till I can scarcely follow or understand, Save that I somehow feel that they are wicked, And God will punish their fierce wantonness! LADY HERON Dear little maiden, how Spring-fresh you are, When you unbosom what I would not haveâ And yet perchance I would! MARGERY I'll give you all, The little that it is, that I do own, So you do want it. LADY HERON Ah! too late! too late! When once the dew hath vanished from the grass, Or the frail petals fallen from the flower, Who can bring back the freshness of the dawn, Or who refold the rose? MARGERY I love you best When you discourse like that. And, lady dear, Be sure of this: through life's unsureness, He, Who made us all in innocency, can Remake us, if we would! LADY HERON Consoling faith! Could we but have it for the asking! Butâ What was I saying? MARGERY That Surrey will be here Ere rounds the clock. Why then dispatch to James A special, swift, and trusty messenger, Bidding him also come? Want you them both? LADY HERON Yes, I want both, because I want but one, For James's presence 'chance may profit Surrey, Haply, myself as well. MARGERY Deem you that fair? LADY HERON Have you ne'er heard that all is fair in war, As 'tis in love, and I have both in hand. Can I but keep James dallying from the field, Or fool him late for the fight, then Surrey's plans, Then Surrey's sword, will be the better for't, And Surrey's love more closely drawn to me. MARGERY That is a snare that never could I set. LADY HERON A snare! The fatuous ensnare themselves, And any other bait would serve as well For such gross feeding. But, remember, child, To lock your lips on that, which it was rash To think aloud, and so forget it straight. MARGERY Nay, you may trust me when I most do blame, And, if you are betrayed, it is yourself Will be the traitress to your treachery, As so, dear lady, it doth seem to me. LADY HERON Seems! Seems! What matters it, forsooth, what seems? In love one has to make what is not, seem, And that which seems, a something different. MARGERY But if the King and Surrey haply meet Here, and at such an hour? LADY HERON Babe! One can take Precaution against such mischance; and none, Were he crowned King and Emperor of the globe, Should on my presence break, or be announced, Were I alone with Surrey. [Looks at the clock.] Oh, how slow! An hour is longer than I thought, its tick, Like to a sickly and enfeebled pulse, Losingly laggard! Hie you, Margery, Hie to the topmost spiral of the Tower, The one that faces Flodden, and see! see! If he be coming. MARGERY Straightway! But I first Would to you make a loving little prayer. LADY HERON And that? MARGERY It is to crave your tender leave To keep a vow perhaps too rashly given To one too worthy to refuse it him. LADY HERON Who is it that you love? MARGERY Young Donald Grey Tells me 'tis he, and I have trust in him, And so believe him. LADY HERON Thrice enviable maiden! Lost in the mystery of a virgin love, Loving you know not what, you scarce know whom, Save that it is not self nor worldliness, Nor anything that's base and surfeiting. MARGERY And thus I still shall dwell upon your lands, And so be near you always. Now I go, To do your bidding. LADY HERON Nay, but wait awhile! He never yet was here afront his time, Nor ever in the rear of it overmuch. And I still love to long for him a little; It sharpens meeting. Therefore, stay you here, And sing to me some simple little song To soften aspiration, till I float On that delicious vacancy that rocks 'Twixt dreaming and awaking. MARGERY What shall I sing? Say, shall it be the lovelorn melody That pleased you yesterday, both air and words Made by King James? LADY HERON By himâby any oneâ What matters it by whom? For, were they writ By the seraphic choristers of Heaven, I still should think of Surrey. MARGERY Always Surrey! Doth James then please no more? LADY HERON He never pleased. But homage pleases from all slaves alike, Kings most of all; and homage that is love Claims some return from grateful loyalty. But his? He hath a score of roaming fancies, And one of twenty would I never be. Thus his feigned homage, wide distributed, Both pleaseth and displeaseth. Oh, how base, Fatuous, and false, women and men alike In the disport and hot pursuit of love, Thus wrongly christened! He conceives to win, While risking nothing. He shall sharply learn I do not rise a loser from such game, And, having won, will all my earnings hand Unto straightforward Surrey. Tell me, Margery, Am I still lovely! MARGERY Ah! too lovely, far. I would not be as beautiful as you. LADY HERON And never be it! Pray to be halt or blear, Ill-favoured, hunch-backed, anything you will, Save hazard sport for foraging desire. But now the Song! MARGERY Love is a dream From which we awaken, When the day-breakers gleam, And the night is forsaken, And all that we longed for Is given and taken. But the dream will return And the darkness refold us, And the vigil-light burn, Yet be none to behold us. Oh, come to me quickly, And hush us and hold us! For life is so clear And the daylight so glaring, That we tremble and fear Lest the heart be too daring. Soft moonlight, lone starlight, Are secret and sparing. So love we and dream, Till from love we awaken, When the day-breakers gleam And the night is forsaken, And the rose that was rosebud Unfolds and is shaken. LADY HERON I like the singer better than the song. You sang it deftly. MARGERY Yet the song is sweet. LADY HERON Perchance too sweet, and pleaseth you because Scarce understood. Things only half surmised Are sweeter, Margery, than things wholly seen. MARGERY But is that not the very spell of song, Of poetry, love, life, earth, heaven, everything? LADY HERON Yes, that is so. MARGERY Wherefore then speak so plain Asânay, forgive meâoftentimes you do? LADY HERON Because there is a yearning at my heart, Or call it what you will, that will be out! MARGERY Then slacken it with hyssop and with tears, And so subdue it. LADY HERON Easily said! MARGERY And done. My soul my sovereign is, whereto the flesh Is a meek subject. LADY HERON O, but I! But I Am all rebellion, with no central sway, From forehead unto footstep. But why prate? Hie to the Tower, and from the battlements Strain your young gaze, and see if he be coming, And then, then hasten down, to give me time To tolerate his coming. MARGERY But, lady dear, How shall I know 'tis he, till he be nigh? LADY HERON Why, by the very air that will divide To line his dignity. He walks the world Like a stray god. If cometh he afoot, Then know him by his strong disdainful stride; If throned upon the saddle, then his steed Will arch its neck and fling its mane abreeze, And fan the dust as though its hoofs were wings To waft him to love's haven. Now, go! go! Nay, just a moment. Hand me the mirror, dear, Andâis there any ringlet out of place, Or have I ruffled half my folds with gust Of my own blowing? What a whirl am I Of storming and subsiding! [Taking the mirror.] Let me see. MARGERY There's not a hair nor tippet crimp awry. You seem a Queen caparisoned for Court, Ready for all the chivalry of the South To come and kiss the queenhood of your hand. LADY HERON Then, to the Tower, and I will wait for him, With my attendant train of longing thoughts. [Exit Margery.] [Enter Surrey. Lady Heron, who has gone a few paces in the other direction to put down the mirror, turns, and seeing him, rushes eagerly towards him.] Surrey! My Surrey! [He embraces her, then paces the room.] Here, before the hour Named in your message, never here too soon. SURREY Because the hour of battle is more near Than hope foresaw. LADY HERON How did you hither come? You surely did not risk your life, alone? SURREY Life? Risk? Life is but one long risk, With something of precaution in it too, In men not daft with daring, or with love. LADY HERON You never would be that. SURREY Foresend I should! Scouts have I out by every curve and ford Of Tweed or Till, dingle, or dip, or wood, Or treacherous dimple of this smiling Border; And if one carle or gallowglass should stir The bracken where I had not bid him hide, His life were worthless as a mountain hare's, With sleuthhounds on its rear, and van, and flank; So came I unaccompanied. LADY HERON To pass [She lays her hand on his shoulder.] A peaceful hour with me! SURREY Yes, and to scan From Ford's commanding fourfold parapets The land around with a yet wider gaze, And keener scrutiny. Say, shall I find Stair, door, and battlement-approaches free, Or is there one to open? LADY HERON Free as is The whole of the world and womankindâto you! Shall you be long atop? SURREY Not long, 'tis sure, For I have ta'en close survey of the scene Where I shall force the fight on, pushed James round From ground of his own choosing, till he stands With back to England, and to Scotland I. At Twizell ford my fellows crossed the Till, The stream breast high, and, had they but been ta'en In that short hour of hazard, as I saw That they were safe against, the feat had been Beyond their force. I cannot think but James Lies not in camp, for I have oft been told Expert he is in cunning purposes, And something must have held him elsewhere, so The deed swift followed on the thought, and now I have him at the 'vantage. LADY HERON (aside) Fortune thus Fosters Love's strategy! SURREY What said you, lady? Forgive me, somewhat absent. LADY HERON That victory, then, Is yours beforehand? SURREY Victory rests with Heaven, Though have I noted, in this wavering world, God's wont gives victory to the wise and strong, Being just in His arbitrament, and loth To aid the dolt and laggard, LADY HERON Here, here is need For no such forceful weapon. For awhile Turn them to me, won long since, not to woo, Yours, maybe not God's gift, but yours withal. Will you go first, or last, unto the Tower? SURREY Nay, as you will; but better, hap, the last, For should I, gazing, see some gap unstopped, Some vantage knoll unheld, I straight should hence To seize it fast, and could not then return. LADY HERON Go last, then, but I pray you go not soon, We have been severed, O, so long, so long! SURREY I cannot bide me, anyway, for long; My thoughts are other-where. LADY HERON They ofttimes are. I do suspect you deem all womankind Mere margin of man's life, past which its text Runs on continuously! SURREY So they are, And so they should be! What, forsooth, is love, Dainty, delicious pastime though it be, When paragoned with statecraft or with war, War above all? Love seems, compared with these, As sleeping unto waking, half-shut eyes To nerve and sinew, body, and brain, and spirit, Astir, aflame, with splendid speculation, Ambition, daring, danger, all that make Existence godlike. Man by war creates New worlds, and fashions them to meet his will, Aye, after his own image, if he win. Its counters are not lives alone, but kingdoms, The future, and the fateful things to be. Now, by God's Passion, on this very hour, And on its undetermined issue, hangs The future of two great opposing Realms, Which never should be otherwise than one. Let England win, and then the brawny race Of stubborn Scotland, brawny, and brave, and stern, Impetuous as its peat-embrownÃ«d burns, Yet fixed of purpose as its deep-laid hills, Shall mix with ours to enrich and strengthen it. Should Scotland win,âbut Scotland must not win; Or, if it should, and you then love me still, Command the faggots for my funeral pyre, Discard your gauds, and loosen your long hair, And wail upon my lifeless body, for I Should not survive that day of ignominy. LADY HERON O, but the victory, certain, will be yours! Tell me it will, it will! SURREY God grant it may! Yet, even if it were not, for there is No hazard in this world like that of war, Not victor, yet not vanquished, one can fall 'Mid noble shouts of battle fray, and then, Soul, ransomed thus from flesh by death's rich stroke, May wing its wayâwho knows?âto fairer realms, In quest of spiritual battle-fields. But like some guttering candle to go out, With women whimpering round, and faltering tongues Of useless leeches, on a soft-stuffed bed, That's not a death for soldiers, or for men! LADY HERON Where did you get this mastery over life, Love, death, and all things? SURREY From my sovran Lord, Will, and its consort, Reason. These unthroned, Life would to me be but disordered dream, A jumbled reminiscence of a past Prior existence in an unshaped world, Where God, and Law, and Discipline were not. LADY HERON But, if men perish on the battle-field, Asudden, and at once, have they then time To make their peace with God? SURREY Do your duty, Be loyal to your country and your King, Then will you always be at peace with God, With self, and whatsoever else there be, Here or elsewhere. [Seating himself by her.] Now let us talk awhile Of gentler themes, and tell me how you pass Your days and Autumn twilights. LADY HERON Drearily, When Surrey is not nigh, and then I wait Till he shall please to come, apart, alone, Or with my little maid, and talk of him, She curious, but not understanding half Of what I say. And then I take my spindle, Till it goes whirling like my thoughts, but twists To better purpose. SURREY You are moulded fair, Comely and winsome, shaped for happiness 'Mid the four walls of home; for motherhood, And honest household rule. Tell me why There sounds an endless yearning in your voice, Like to the wave that wandereth to and fro, Wailing for something, nowhere to be found. LADY HERON Because I wail for you! The Universe, Without you, were not boundary enough To fold my longings. SURREY Where is your rightful lord? LADY HERON At James's Court, prisoner or fugitive, I know not which. SURREY Shall I try ransom him? LADY HERON He scarce is worth the ransoming. He is One of those men, born insignificant, Who make the little world in which they live Nor larger, nor yet smaller, for being in it: Smaller, if anything. Know you King James? SURREY Not in the flesh; only his effigy, In Scottish embassy to Harry's Court At the betrothal of Queen Margaret. He's a well-looking man. LADY HERON And is he brave? SURREY He is a King, and therefore is he brave, He is a King, therefore magnanimous: For there is something, somehow, in a Crown, That gives the wearer princely dignity, Or why should common folk bow down to it? LADY HERON Stand you in awe of it? SURREY Well, maybe not, But I do honour and revere its wearer, As doth become a leal and faithful subject! Though in my inmost thought I will confess The noblest of all Sceptres is the Sword: The Sword of Peace, if men will have it so, If not, the Sword that strikes and is resolved, Nor scabbarded till Victory tilts the scales! I have heard it said James is a poet, too, Who moulds soft lays to lime frail women's hearts, And make them stay their fluttering. LADY HERON Did you ever Fashion a verse? SURREY Once, but a battle-song, Rough and ungainly, lacking quite in numbers, For aught I know. In these luxurious days, Men seem to have learnt soft verse from Italy. But, as for mine, the soldiers in the camp Will troll it round their watch-fires through the night, Till they wax drowsy. Somehow thus it runs:â SURREY'S BATTLE-SONG I Now Knight, and now Yeoman, Now horseman, now bowman, Up, up from your slumber, and stream to the fray! Strong archer, stern pikemen, Fleet and sturdy alike, men, Forth, forward, and strike, men, Till the foe from your faces are fleeing away! II Leave matron and maiden, Leave sleek tresses braiden, Think only of fighting for country and King; Of the tussle before ye, Of duty and glory, Of names great in story, That manhood exults in, and troubadours sing! LADY HERON It peals like sounded clarion, stirs the blood, Is of your very self that felt and wrote it. SURREY Feel thoughtfully and fervidly enough, Words sing themselves. LADY HERON But sang you ne'er of love? SURREY Not that I mind me. But I rarely dwell On thoughts of love, save when I bide with you. LADY HERON And then you give me only half your thought. SURREY What would you, lady? More were treachery, Desertion, cowardice, and loss of manhood. We live in troublous and entangled times, And 'tis my business to deal with them: And if in snatched reposefulness I hear Flourish of trumpet or distress of State, To these I straightway hasten. Could you love, Or yield to, any man that did not do so? LADY HERON Not wholly, solely. But methinks I could Love to be loved by many a smaller man, To prove my power, and test his feebleness. For thuswise are we framed. SURREY Nay, nay, not all. Methinks my mother was not like to that. And I have whimsically deemed, though I In such deep matters am but simpleton, There are three sorts of women: they who move Men to warm tenderness, not hot desire, And these the best and noblest. Then there are Those who o'er-brimmingly unsluice the blood, And set it flowing and fuming in men's veins, Then straightway tranquillise it in their own More deep continuous current; nor would I Defame such natures, for in sooth they are Honest, though ofttimes differently named, But would reserve reproving and reproach For those, the last and lowest sure of all, Who kindle fires to see how these will burn, And not for need or comfort. LADY HERON You are not The simpleton you deem you. Surrey! Surrey! You know too much. SURREY Who is it then that taught me? LADY HERON Perchance 'twas I. For verily I am Compounded of all three. SURREY Smother the third! For women who are that, and that alone, Should have a millstone round their neck, and find An unbaptizÃ«d coffin in the sea, Or be exposed upon the mountain-side, Ere they have grown to be it. LADY HERON For you, for you, I fain would be the first! Withal, I am The second, when you will it! SURREY Rashly said, And no less generously; and I should be The most ungrateful of ungrateful men Did I not own me that I still must live, Your bankrupt debtor! LADY HERON Tell me that again! For when you pass from rough mood into smooth, I feel as once I felt, homing from France, When the tumultuous mountains of the sea Subsided to a still blue land-locked lake, And, husht, we glided into haven. SURREY Words Still have you at your beck, all silky soft, That seem to come like petted doves to call, And settle where you will, coo at your lips, Sue you as though you were their very mate, And they had come to make their nest with you. Learned you the trick in France, where I am told 'Tis best acquired, and men too practise it? Time was, soft lays were left to Troubadours, And steel had been ashamed to indite sleek rhymes. But now some bravest warriors that I know Fondle and finger a sonnet till they mould Its roundness to their fancy. LADY HERON Like to James! But, as for me, I have no trick acquired From France or anywhere, unless it be The trick of tricking out myself in this Becoming flimsinessâif so it beâ SURREY Bewitching even as your very self, Or with it, or without it! ButâI must go. LADY HERON Nay, go not yet! Stay just a little while. SURREY It is the hour; nor tarried I so long, But that, so far as human wit can work, I have left nought to chance. So now, farewell! (A burst of battle Music is heard in the Court without.) LADY HERON Hark! What is that? SURREY The rough-hewn battle-song I told you of, my wilder fellows troll Around their watch-fires ere they sleep o'nights. Who may these singers be? LADY HERON The Troop of Ford, Mustering to start for Flodden. Will you not Speak some brave words to them before they go, And make their hearts as valiant as yours? SURREY If such should be their wish, and likewise yours. [Enter the Troop led by Donald Grey.] SURREY Captain and Yeomen of the lands of Ford, I came to see you martial-mustered here, As so I now behold you, hill-men all, And, like your hills, inured to winds and war. I am a soldier, destitute of words, And stammering in speech, the craft of peace. But honour is the chiefest quest of man, And, of all honours or in war or peace, The greatest is, for Fatherland to die, And, nearest that, to hazard life for it. King Hal for England's honour rides through France, That hath against him enmity proclaimed, And into unjust quarrel Scotland dragged. With Scotland it were natural that we All peacefully and neighbourly should live; But against England and her royal rights Should the whole world unmannerly conspire, Then, whilst our War-keels danced upon the wave, Along our coasts the clarion would outshrill The clanging trumpet, and your feathered shafts Bristle along cliff, shingle, promontory, And bid the ravenous universal hosts Come, if they dare! I am for Peace; we all Count peace the rightful heritage of man, But peace with justice, liberty, and honour. You, you brave Border striplings, mustered here, To-day shall clustered stand behind my Knights, And be a portion of my bodyguard; And never an inch go backward till you see Surrey, a craven, flying from the foe. Now, God protect you all! [Exeunt the Troop, headed by Donald, singing Surrey's song.] LADY HERON The battle done, You hither will return? SURREY That rests with Heaven, Again I say, and issue of the struggle. Should James be routed, and his flight cut off, Haply I may. But who as yet can see Which way a worsted rabble-rout will wind, Whichever wins the day. So now, farewell. But, ere I go, accept this little sprig Of fresh white heather plucked on mountain-side. LADY HERON O, welcome gift! A pledge at least by me Of endless love, and love's expectancy! One moment! See, your sword-belt is awry; Let me adjust it. There! One more farewell! Would that it never ended! Victory light And linger on your banner till its folds Unfurl to flash the splendour of your name Around a dazzled world! [Exit Surrey. Lady Heron mounts the steps of the embrasure, and watches him as he departs, the Ford Troop singing his Battle-song.] END OF ACT I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II SCENE as in Act I (Margery. Donald) MARGERY I would you were not going, yet I would Not have you stay behind! Full well I know What is man's part in this resisting world: To breast aside a sea of opposites, Wave after wave, then, buoyed upon their crest, Be borne to whatsoever end he will. And yet, and yet, my dream of happinessâ But this is not the fitting hour for dreams, And so I will be silent. DONALD Nay, but tell me. No dream of yours will e'er untimely be To my attentive ear. MARGERY It is that you Should fare to none save happy, peaceful fields, And I should go with you where'er you went: To watch the seed-corn dropped into the drill, Or leaning oat-stooks dotted o'er the stubble, Like weathered tents, a bivouac of peace; Or, best of all, when comfortable Winter Brings the long evenings and the blazing hearth, To sit together by our own fireside. DONALD All this shall be when transitory War Hath, like the hurtling hurricane, spent its force, Or rolled elsewhere. MARGERY Pray Heaven that it be soon! Ah me! weak women have the harder part In this unequal world: to wait in dread, Having no power to shape or ward the issue, On which depends their doom. DONALD Heaven's equity Will otherwhere the balance readjust. If nobleness the greatest greatness be, As is my deepest Creed, then woman is Greater, aye, even stronger, than is man. So, of your goodness help me with your prayers Your hopeful trust! MARGERY Take, then, this talisman, Brought by Crusader from Jerusalem, My Mother's gift; then this one, last of all, [Embraces him.] To bring you home unscathed! [Exeunt.] [Enter Lady Heron.] LADY HERON Slave that I am! And doomed to slavery by Love's feebleness! Yet where's the woman would not rather be Enslaved to such a lord, than ramble free In quest of such another! For it is The yearning of us all to be enslaved; And O, how many in servitude there be, Captive to conquerors weaker than themselves! Chain like to that would I break, aye, and have broken. Fettered to fool or fondling? Never, never! It is their business to subdue, and ours To be right willing subjects. If only James do come, and I can stay His going till the battle hath begun, There's not a wile in woman's armoury I will not use to keep him! [Enter Margery.] Did you see Surrey? MARGERY He burst upon the Tower While I was straining all my gaze to scan If he were nigh. LADY HERON And on me, unaware, As I was waiting for your warning, broke, And stayed with me awhile. But youâbut youâ What did you when his apparition streamed, Like to the Royal Standard in the wind, From topmost turret? MARGERY I stood mute for awe, For dread, forânay, in sooth I know not what, And then craved leave to go. He bade me stay, And serve him with my clear young eyes, he said, For wider seeing. Then, with lordly thanks And courtly majesty he sent me here. I would not be an hour with him alone, For all my vaunted moated maidenhood. LADY HERON And never be it! For he roams the earth With tender strength, bewitching not bewitched, And that's the King for women, Margery! Now you know more, indulge me in my sin, As God, who made him what he is and us Such as we are, sure will when comes the day Of frailty's stern arraignment; for we are Finely poised vanes for men's imperious gusts To veer at will. It oft is called caprice. 'Tis they who are capricious, and not we. Weâweâhave too much Spring sap in our blood, Too much of madcap April, which oft shows E'en in our slow-decaying autumn days, That leave our vanished loveliness and lures Winter's lone retrospect and barren tears. MARGERY Is it true King James has had as many loves As rumour says? LADY HERON Likely enough, and more; And so the more to count and reckon with, When his frail Kingship comes again one's way. MARGERY They say that paramours are the privilege Of Princes and of Poets. LADY HERON A vulgar fancy! They are not the privilege of any man, But, from far-off dead patriarchal days, Common to Kings, and poets, and common folk. But, happier these perchance, obscurity, None care to penetrate, leaves dark their weakness. MARGERY I do not understand these roaming loves, But only one long love, one, one, one always, Such as I give to Donald, and he to me. LADY HERON Well, maybe, Margery, 'tis the only one; And that is why men never love at all, And we by love are never satisfied, Since it deserves, in them, another name. But, as I heard a gallant once in France Say, men are dispositioned so, they deem Their first love is their last, their last their first. [A sound of voices outside.] LADY HERON What is that stir without? Go, child, and learn! [Exit Margery, and forthwith returns.] MARGERY A wandering minstrel in the court without Claims audience, and will suffer no denial. LADY HERON (to MARGERY) 'Tis the King! Be sure of that, obedient to my bidding. Conduct him hither, saying 'tis my will. Then leave us, Margery. ... O well-set snare! [Exit Margery.] [Enter King James in the disguise of a minstrel, which he at once discards.] [Lady Heron makes obeisance.] KING Rise! I would rather welcomed be by you, Than knelt to by all subjects in the world. LADY HERON I feared that you were in the battle-field, Protecting Scotland! KING And so I am, or was, And shortly shall be once again. But now, I come to winânay, the word 'scaped meâwoo, A fairer and yet more protected Realm. LADY HERON Do not a scattered band of scouts and spies Watch all the ways? KING Not the long wayless way Whereby I came; for Surrey holds the South, My host the North, half-circle each! Beside, There is a rude but ready-witted man, Threaded me here, who can play many parts, Cutpurse or beggar, whining now for alms, Now flinging them abroad; and this disguise Enforcing with his own. Fear not for me! LADY HERON But what of Surrey and his English host? KING Nigh face to face with mine by Flodden Field, Where I have all my dispositions made, The Cheviots in my rear, the Till afront, Huntley and Home commanding on the left, Argyll and Lennox on the right, myself Reserved to lead the centre. But enough, Enough of war's rough issues. How is she, The camp of my affections, utmost range Of my heart's conflict? LADY HERON As you see! KING How fair! Fairer no gift could make you. Yet I have Brought jewels to this jewel, pearls to pearl Whiter than all the whiteness of the foam The far-off seas have petrified to pearl To round the throat and curl among the curls, And meekly pray you wear these for the sake, Not of their loveliness, but of your own, Till men shall think them lovelier because Of that from which they shine. LADY HERON Nay, you misjudge. 'Tis not for gaze of men fair women wear Necklace, tiara, clasp, and stomacher, But to outshine, o'ershadow, other women. KING You need no jewels of the sea or mine, Sapphire, or pearl, or diamond, to do that. Bejewelled by your beauty, you outgleam The beauties of all Courts in Christendom. But, your devoted servitor, I have Another and a far more precious gift Provided for your pleasure, self forgot And self's less generous thoughts. LADY HERON What may that be? KING Your husband. LADY HERON He! KING A prisoner in my hands, Forânay, what matters it for what, well known To you no less than me and all the world,â Withal your husband, I in vain besought That you would visit at my Court, he bound, On parole, as a formidable foe Along this wavering Border, not to fly And join my enemies, I have set free, Without condition. LADY HERON (anxiously) When will he be here? KING Not yet, not yet, save homeward track there be Unknown to folk familiar less with hills, Gorges, and torrents, of this much-scarred land, Than native lords whose life hath dwelt within it. Shall I recite the latest song I made,â One makes so many,âon the endless theme I see before me now? LADY HERON I pray you, Sir! KING I Oh, fair are Scotland's birken woods, And fair her becks and burns, When maiden buds fling back their hoods, And pairing-time returns. But fairer than her mavis groves And sweeter than her streams, When loving lad with lassie roves, Is the Lady of my dreams. II Now were I lord of Stirling town, Or Scotland's sceptred Chief, I would fling down my robe and crown, To share her bliss and grief; With her to moil in mountain field, When oaten stooks are dried, To be her shield thro' darkening weald, Then slumber at her side. LADY HERON Which of the ladies at King James's Court Inspired that amorous lilting roundelay? KING The one sole lady at the one sole Court Whereat he pays his homage. [Kisses her hand.] LADY HERON Deftly answered, Following so well on lay so dexterous. When Provence was the realm of Chivalry, You would have been the Prince of Troubadours. 'Tis said that Surrey never turns a stave. KING He is to-day then much behind the fashion. LADY HERON He wakes to thought of war and statesmanship, And sleeps to dream of statesmanship and war. There is a towering terror in his gaze, A menace in his very quietness. Were I a man, his friend I fain would be, Never his enemy. KING But, being a woman, how Do such stern elements affect your heart? LADY HERON My heart? Good Sir, they leave it as it was, In awe, the natural attitude of woman. It is the mind he dominates, such mind As the heart leaves scant room for in us women. KING But he? Has he no room for love and joy, Even in the throng of statesmanship and war? LADY HERON Surmising if I answer, I should say Love is with him a flitting interlude, A trivial, restful, and refreshing sport, From weightier business. He is nought but Soldier, No poet-lover. KING May not a man be both? Kings, soldiers, poets, all are flesh and blood. LADY HERON And all as changeable! with flesh as quick As the sere ling to any trivial flame, And blood as quick to rise and fall as spate, And slackening water, in our Border Tweed. KING They say that womenkind are like to that. LADY HERON They say! They say! It is you poets say it, Because that you have got the saying of't; The being of it sooth to both being common, And, with your leave, to Kings. Were't otherwise, It were a dull and stationary world, I would as lief be out of. At the best, 'Tis somewhat drear. KING Till love enliven it, Then life becomes a cheerful road enough, Save that the milestones pass too rapidly. LADY HERON It may be so for Kings, but not for Queens. I would not be King James's Queen for all The titles and the robes in Christendom. But, ever since men sate upon a throne, Queens have too often but a sighing time. KING Unless they be fair queens by courtesy, Then are they more besought than any King, Having yet more to give. LADY HERON And when they give it, Are straight dethroned. KING To sit on yet some other, If that be so. But men there are, dear lady, Who do not tire of such fair Queens as you, And, by the Saints of Scotland, I am one. LADY HERON What is this love we prate about so much, Honouring the most inconstant thing on earth With specious character of constancy, And singing and re-singing of it as if It by us still abided, though it be Itself as transitory as any song? A mother's or a foster-mother's love For peevish babe; a sister's for a brother, He all unworthy; soldiers for some cause, Or good or bad, or right or wrong, deemed good, Imagined right, for thinking it will serve; Aye, even a ripened woman's for ripening man, Who never ripens,âthese, an you will, deserve The title and the dignity of Love; But not the fawnings of ferocious men, Quick promises, more quick forgetfulness. One might as well deck with the name of love Fierce forays on our Border for sleek kine, Or poise of hovering hawk before it swoop Down on fear-fascinated dove that should Fly when it crouches, tears its entrails out, Casting its foolish feathers to the wind, Then wings its satiated lust aloft In quest of further victims! But I rave, And you smile mockingly. KING Nay, who can tell The meaning of a smile? There are so many; The smile of innocence, the smile of guilt; Of sympathy, disdain, I know not what, The backward-pondering, forward-looking smile, And what some call the philosophic smile, And finally, wae's me! the smile of death. LADY HERON Nay, that's the last and wisest smile of all. KING You are much too wise to-day. But, as for me, I never have but one same smile for you, The smile of love and longing. LADY HERON You forget There is the smile of cloistered holiness, And chaste seclusion. I have a little maid. And she hath that, and dearly do I love her, Because I have it not. KING Well, in little maids. But women who worship holiness disdain The man that hath it. LADY HERON Since he thus disdains us. In man we worship manhood, valour, strength, Aye, waywardness, if it but honour us. Is that not why? KING You are askew to-day; I cannot set you straight. Now must I go, And in the hurly-burly of the fight With Surrey and his Southrons half forget Fair Ford and fairer chatelaine. LADY HERON Go not yet! You seem but just to have come. How you lack patience And fail to mark that what I feel to-day I may not feel to-morrow, what I felt But yesterday, to-day I feel no more. We are but dancing bubbles on the stream, And man the forceful current. KING So you say, But, when I am anear you, then meseems You are the current, and the bubble I. LADY HERON Recite to me once more; for poesy is The drug that brings the mind oblivion, Wherein we drowse 'twixt two opposing worlds, Sleeping and waking, heedless which is which, If either, both, or neither, life or death, And know not which were sweeter. KING Love, they say, is charm and cheat, April fancy, summer heat, Leaving wintry cold and sleet; Wandering as the cuckoo's cry When the Springtime days go by, And we smile and know not why; False in form, and garb, and face, Screen unto a deadly chase, Woman's sorrow, man's disgrace. Who is it that slanders so Highest, holiest thing below, Upward-straining mortals know? Life's last loftiest peak and crest, Worthiest longing, purest quest, Heaven's clear height made manifest; Whence we look adown and scan All the ways and works of man, God's wide world, and mighty plan. Be His will by us obeyed. Love we all that He hath made, In the sunshine, in the shade; Proud and lowly, great and small, Hill, and lake, and waterfall, Sweet, sad woman, most of all! LADY HERON That is a deeper and diviner strain, And so too large to fit my littleness; Withal I do commend the mind that made it; Yet see how language' self becomes a cheat, And very pandar, when employed by love. Love signifies a hundred different things, And with its better meaning veils its worse. That is the truth of it. KING Now, go I must, Or shall be late. LADY HERON More reason you should stay, To prove you love me. KING Doth not my comingâHark! Methought I heard a far-off clarion shrill. LADY HERON We hear that which we listen for, and see The thing expected, though are neither there. Shall we ascend the Tower, and thence descry What you would know? KING 'Tis better that I went. LADY HERON What! all this wooing, and not one embrace! [Tenders him her cheek, which he kisses, as she affects to hold him. While she is doing so, door is thrown open, and enter her husband. Seeing James and Lady Heron's attitude, he halts, and looks from one to the other.] LADY HERON (with perfect composure) His Majesty, King James! SIR WILLIAM I did not think So soon again to see the Scottish King. Under my roof-tree, too, and patent 'tis No stranger there. In war no less than peace, In camp as at his Court, so it would seem, He needs must have his light-o'-loves to ease The weight of Kingship and the load of State. He had done better and more royally To keep his prisoner than betray him thus, Or be more timely in his treachery. But, Madam, it is you, you first of all, I ask to what, long absent from my home, I this dishonourable honour owe From the seductive semblance of a King, Who on the eve of battle leisure finds To play the royal cuckoo. Now, the truth! For I will suffer nothing but the truth, Have I to pluck it forcibly from both. LADY HERON Then you shall hear the truth, and so shall he! He came to woo me, and he came in vain, As, if he came a thousand times, he would. Think you I know not of the loves at home, The loves abroad,âthe two are truly one,â Of his most amorous Northern Majesty, Or that I have not heard of Lady Scrope, His latest leman! I am merely one, Or was to have been, could he have had his way, Of the frail puppets of his gracious favour. But you, my lord, perhaps will answer me, If that your wife be fashioned like to that, And if I bear a rival near my throne? KING Great Heaven! Who is it, then, that brought me here? LADY HERON 'Twas I! 'Twas I, exultant to have done it. Hie to that embrasure, and gaze beyond, And see where now your army lies encamped, With back to England, road to Scotland barred; Your hosts disadvantageously swung round By English skill! You whining all the while Here at my feet, and, like an honest man, Whining, confess, in vain! I lured you here, For England's sake, for sake of English Throne, Her King, Her Cause! SIR WILLIAM Pray Heaven the tale be true. I will return anon, when this strange guest Hath ta'en his leave, whom here I leave to be Dismissed or stayed by you, as seems you best. [Exit Sir William.] KING Magnificently acted! LADY HERON Duped again! I heard the trumpets riding on the wind, Here while you knelt and simpered of your love. You will be late, and I it was who kept you! O, I am dead aweary of your sighs And songful sueing. See you never, man, The world's a woman, waiting to be subdued, Not wooed, but won. Keep back your tenderness, Until they have surrendered. Crush them! Outrage them! And awe them into love's submissiveness! Then leave them to their languishing, and go, Stronger for that imperative embrace, And hew your way to whatso throne you will. KING Can it be true? Tell me it is not true. I cannot think so fair a thing as you Can be so false. LADY HERON Or man so fatuous. Doubt it, believe it, doubt it then again, Nor ever know if truth, or doubt, be true. But 'twould mis-seem me to forget to thank Your Majesty for liberating thus My loving lord, so timely in return, So welcome here at any time. Now go! Or you will be too late for your defeat, As now you are for victory! KING Spake then The Apparition at Linlithgow true, And do these warnings from a bodyless world Forbode our Fate? âGo not to war with England! Or, if the hotness of your blood demand That sanguinary ordeal, beware, Beware of woman's glamour, woman's wiles.â Farewell! with whom none ever can fare well, As fair as Heaven, yet more false than Hell! [Exit.] LADY HERON Farewell! Not fair, though false. Come to me, Surrey, And I will yield you all I have to give, My love, my lord, my conqueror, my King! My merciless Commander! END OF ACT II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE:âThe same as in Acts I and II SIR WILLIAM (alone, pacing the gallery) Is the tale true? Or true in part, in part False, as such tales in truth are apt to be? Do Kings sue ever in vain to women's ears? Not to their ears, if ofttimes to their hearts, Nor often toâGod! how is one to know? A woman's fancy is more easily moved Than is her blood. I never could move either, Her proud cold ladyship's the least of all, And by her very coldness have been made More cold to others. But a King! A King! With throne, and crown, and royal robes set off, Homage of men, and love of other women, Or felt or feigned, fond expectation strained In the loose bosom of the fond and frail, Till virtue, honour, vow, fidelity, Into the circling pool of harlotry Are whirled and whelmed! O, if I but could know, Could know, could learn! [Enter Margeryâseeing Sir William, she hesitates.] Nay, go not, Margery! [Aside.] Here sure is one can tell, if any can. ... [To Margery, abruptly.] Saw you King James, when he was here to-day? MARGERY A moment, ere he went. SIR WILLIAM How looked he then? MARGERY Like to a man distraught. SIR WILLIAM Why, why distraught? What cause had he? MARGERY I pray you, do not ask. SIR WILLIAM But ask of you I must. Say truly, Margery, Do you love Lady Heron? MARGERY With all my being, Heart, soul, mind, body, service, everything. SIR WILLIAM Then you would lie for her? MARGERY I trust I should not. Nay, more, I trust I never shall have need. SIR WILLIAM Notânot to save her honour? MARGERY Honour gone, What then were left to save? SIR WILLIAM (aside) True. And still truer, We only lie to cover other lies, And wounded honour with dishonour veil, To save it from persistent penalty. [To Margery.] King James for Lady Heron hathâa fancy? MARGERY Belike he has. It is a way men have With comely women, I have heard it said. SIR WILLIAM And Lady Heron aâfancy for King James? MARGERY O no, my lord! That were a different way, A different, worse, and far more dangerous way. SIR WILLIAM How know you that her thoughts not that way wend? MARGERY Because I saw him come, I saw him go, Coldly received, disdainfully dismissed. SIR WILLIAM Then why was he received? MARGERY You know Kings must be, Mustâmust. But surely, sir, you understand? SIR WILLIAM He hath a pleasing and a winning air. MARGERY Is not that kingly? SIR WILLIAM Writes love-ditties, tooâ MARGERY Music, and verse, and both are sweet to women. SIR WILLIAM And flattery, Margery. MARGERY Haply, sir, and flattery. Are men indifferent to it? SIR WILLIAM Tell me, then? My lady hath a fancy for no man? MARGERY How can we mortals read each others' hearts? God only can do that. You ask too much. I pray you let my answering suffice A question wiselier put by none of us Anent another. [Enter Seneschal.] SENESCHAL (to SIR WILLIAM) Go you not, good my lord, to Flodden Field, Where gone have all your fighting men, save those Who needs must stay behind to sentry Ford? SIR WILLIAM And gone, I trust, to join the English camp. SENESCHAL So 'tis surmised, assumed. Withal, who knows? We Border folk are sparing of our speech, Covert in thought. It is the Border way, And many a man is deemed of English pulse, Whose heart beats secretly with Scottish hopes. But, go you there, they there too will remain, Faithful, leastways, to you, their rightful lord. SIR WILLIAM Give me my armour; battle-axe and sword, Borne by my ancestor at Bannockburn, And trusty still. SENESCHAL They hang upon the wall. [Sir William dons his armour, assisted by Seneschal and Margery, and exit accompanied by both.] [As the door closes, enter Lady Heron.] LADY HERON Gone! All of them gone, unto the battle-field! Surrey, to win, then hitherward return; James, to defeat and rout, unless Heaven should Turn likelihood to baffled expectation, As in this contrary surprising world Will sometimes hap,âbut not to-day, to-day, In labour with two Kingdoms' fate, and mine! My own untimely-coming lord, too, gone, To join the English camp, his faith assured, As well in sooth it should be, of the truth Of what I swore to him, on this, on this. [Taking up a crucifix, then laying it down.] What proves his bearing and his fate in fightâ Well, need is none, to ponder upon that TillâLet me think! In truth I cannot think, But only feel! [Sees the pearls brought by James.] The lust-bribe of a King! His precious pearls, and no more prized than he. [Flings them on the table; takes from her bosom, and kisses, the sprig of white heather given her by Surrey.] This is the gift I cherish, for it is Love's white flower 'mong the crimson crop of blood. [Enter Seneschal, Margery, and Four Men-at-Arms.] SENESCHAL Madam, the armies are in motion, and The fight begun upon the nearward wing. Shall I conduct you to the Tower? LADY HERON Unless We here command the field. [They mount the embrasure, whence Flodden Field is full in their view, but not in that of the audience.] SENESCHAL Yes, perfectly. Here, Madam, with your leave. Hence you survey More advantageously the field. LADY HERON How plain I can descry the Flodden slopes, and watch The bowmen and the spearmen choose their ground, Scatter or swarm, halt or advance, andâsee! The English feathers flicker through the air. MARGERY Aye, but fall short. SENESCHAL They measure but the ground. Now have they found it, and how fast and thick, Quicker than word to thought, they vault the space Betwixt them and their aim. Do you see Surrey? LADY HERON Who doth not see the sun when it doth shine? Even at that distance he half dazzles one, And frightens one to look! He flasheth swift Among the medley of the combatants, Now here, now there, now everywhere at once, According as one gazes. MARGERY But, look! look! His fellows hovering eastward seem to waver And breed disorder in the ranks behind. LADY HERON 'Tis but a feint to draw the enemy, I'll pledge me. What say you, Sir Seneschal? SENESCHAL Who can be sure but he who holds command? Your younger eyes range more afield than mine, And with a sharper vision. LADY HERON Seems it still As if they yielded ground? Say, Margery! MARGERY Nay, there is such confusion, north with south, One blade with the other, battle-axe with pike, 'Tis hard to say, save that they shock and shout, And all alike strike fiercely, manfully, And many fall, nor rise from where they fall. God shrive their sins! SENESCHAL Death will do that for them. Who die in battle for their mother-land Are counted 'mong the martyrs. What fierce shouting! LADY HERON Yes, and how plain one hears them! To which side Do your affections lean? SENESCHAL Troth, noble lady, The Border blood that flows within my veins, Like Tweed itself, inclines now here, now there, But ends by warming to the winning side, As being the stouter. MARGERY Mine the losing one. I cannot help though I be chidden for it. SENESCHAL 'Tis the more maidenly. LADY HERON But where's the King? Look where I will, I cannot see King James. MARGERY Look! look! He hastes all bonnetless and bare, As though he cometh tardily. And see! They bring him helm, and sword, and battle-axe, And with hot haste he pusheth to the front. LADY HERON Then Surrey swift to meet him. MARGERY So he doth; And the two armies cluster them around, As bees about their monarch. LADY HERON See you more? MARGERY No, only flashing blades and glittering spears, Arms lifted, huge men stricken to the knee, Rising afresh and dealing stroke for stroke, And others staggering, falling, trampled on, To rise no more. I cannot brook the sight Of savage strokes. LADY HERON But Surrey and the King? SENESCHAL It is no longer possible to say, The melly grows so thick. But you descry, There in the midway opening of the wood, Nigh to the welling fountain that we know, The rival Standards, and they must be there. See! Scotland's is pushed back. MARGERY And now it droops And is or lowered or folded from the sight. LADY HERON O, if I had but your young eyes! Yes! now, Nowânowâthe Flag of England floats and flies In triumph o'er the field. I see it plain. SENESCHAL It yet may be a feint; for Scottish brains Are canny as the Scottish blood is brave. Yet seems it as though everywhere they feel The weight of English numbers. LADY HERON And the force Of Surrey's skill. His breast is full as stout, His mind more domineering, will like steel That takes not nay! MARGERY (aside) Be cautious, lady, lest The carles surmise the secret of your heart. LADY HERON Think you I reck of that? Were I but there, I would bid the trumpets shrill it o'er the field, Till Flodden rang with Surrey's name and mine, Proud to be reckoned 'mong his followers. MARGERY Bide, bide, till that he comes with victor wounds Gaping for woman's tenderness. SENESCHAL All is lost! Lost, lost, for Scotland is this brief affray. See, everywhere they give, both flanks outflanked, And forced back to the centre. None save fools Now would abide for butchery, but find Shelter from death, to face another fight. Rout, panic, following fury, wend this way, The worsted to bestride the Till before Escape be barred, the victors to o'ertake The scattered fugitives, and slay, slay, slay, With blade and pike, and shouts of mastery. MARGERY O, I can look no more! Donald is there! LADY HERON Now, glory be to Surrey! MARGERY And to Heaven! You forget Heaven and God! LADY HERON Surrey is Heaven to me, And God as well! MARGERY He would be first to chide, If he did hear you! Shall we not descend, And order bracken and heather to be spread For comfort of the sore who claim from Ford God's truce and woman's pity? LADY HERON Yes! ajar Roll Ford's main gate, that friend and foe alike, Conquering and conquered, may such pallet find As it can give them. [Aside] Sure, he too will come, And let me loose his belt, and wipe his brow, And tend upon his triumph. SENESCHAL I were shamed, But for my stiffening limbs, to have been so nigh A fight so stubborn, and not share in it. But the years follow on the years, and we Must travel with them till the end be reached, When we shall neither fight nor fret us more. LADY HERON 'Tis better to think less upon the end, More of the march. SENESCHAL But thought runs before That end of all our ends, and wonders what Will be our welcome there! LADY HERON Well, to descend. [Exeunt Omnes, save Lady Heron. Margery swiftly returns.] MARGERY Gramercy! How they come! The gate stands wide, Portcullis lifted, with the drawbridge down, And through they pour, a miserable crowd, Some hale, but gasping, others limping sore, Few with their weapons, in their armour none, For cast away in flight. The Seneschal And all your servitors attend on them. And, night at hand, those born to be obeyed Call off the human sleuthhounds of the chase From following into Ford. LADY HERON 'Tis well. Go, see The wounded lack for nothing Ford can give, And bid the Chaplain wait upon the dying. MARGERY He is there, already. [Enter Donald.] DONALD Madam, Surrey comes, With triumph-red retainers at his heels. [Enter Surrey, with armed attendants, to whom he signifies they are to retire.] LADY HERON Surrey! Great Surrey! [Margery seeks to retire with Donald.] SURREY Go not, little maid! It freshens one to see so young a thing, After the brawny fellows of the fight. She is a running stream to thirsty lips, Is she not, Lady? LADY HERON She indeed must be. We elders are too stagnant. SURREY What a rout! [Lady Heron undoes his belt, and Margery takes his casque.] But oh! how many upon either side, Stalwart and sinewy, still in April trim Alike for war or wooing, who had not Yet done with life, but had to put it off At bidding of Bellona, lie outstretched, With mire-fouled love-locks and death-tethered limbs, Mute as the marble that should honour them. LADY HERON Nay, tell me not of that! I turn away Even from the imagination of the sight. SURREY And yetâand yet! Theirs was a glorious death, Making them princely all, and their great souls Have gone before the Judgment Throne of Heaven, Absolved from life's offences by its close, Henceforth to beâfor so conceives my thoughtâ The chosen troop and bodyguard of God! The field once won, pursuit delights me not. There always are enough for that. Withal One must not baulk them of their quarry quite, Or never would they take the scent again, That leads to victory. Never have I faced So stout, so brave, so masculine a foe. Now, by my English sword, these Scottish hearts Held on unvanquished when outvanquished quite By strategy and numbers. Could we twain, Northward and southward of the Border, be One kingdom and one people, I aver In battle we could front an envious world, And not be worsted. LADY HERON Saw you my husband? SURREY I ne'er have seen him, so I cannot say. But I beheld an instant Ford's device Among my wavering wing upon the right, Wherein confusion reigned, and many seemed Baffled and captured. LADY HERON And the Scottish King? SURREY Alas! Alas! Death holds him prisoner! And all the wealth of all the world is not Enough to rescue or to ransom him. LADY HERON Dead! And how died he? SURREY As becomes a King! As I myself would die, did Heaven but leave How to our choosing! Late, but cramming close The moments left him with heroic deeds; Here, there, restoring everywhere at once The balance of the battle. Had he not been Somehow belated,âwhy, I cannot say,â And those first strokes that oft decide the last Ere these be struck, not been at my disposing, My vantage had been smaller, victory less, My death-roll larger, and the King himself Still 'mong the living. LADY HERON Tell me, to whose blade Did the King fall? SURREY To mine, or rather, his own. When first I saw him plain, he seemed inflamed By something, some one, hidden from surmise, And, when first eye to eye with me in fight, He towered to strike, then rushed upon my sword, Ere I had time to swerve with it, and aim Not in the very death's eye of life's target, But at some outer and less mortal mark, That scores surrender. O, the pity of it! LADY HERON (to MARGERY) Go, child, unto the gate, and bring back word, If there be couch and food enough for all. You will not grudge her for a few brief moments For service so intent and womanly? SURREY Better employed than so she could not be. Hence, tenderly, and see you how they fare, For seeing you will make them fare the better; And bring back speedy word, for I myself Would move among them, though less helpful, i'faith, Alike in speech and seeming. [Exit Margery.] Now, dear lady, Who sent me to the shock with trustful words, And make me welcome with such gracious ones, Now that the deed is done, can Ford to-night Concede to me its shelter? LADY HERON All Ford hath, And all that is within it, save it be That sock-lamb, Margery. SURREY Her tender years And maidenhood ensure her sanctuary From the most sacrilegious gaze alive. Her whiteness shows against a sinful world, Like wing-furled swan anchored on leaden mere. LADY HERON I spake in jest. But all the rest is yours, As though you had, like Flodden, conquered it. Your chamber hath been furnished hard by mine, And by my hand sweetened with lavender, Soft-carpeted from sound of voice or tread, Pillow, and sheet, and quilt, and coverlet, As for a kingly head; drugs to deep slumber, When further waking wearies you. Myself Will linger on your wants, await your will, And, if I only may your handmaid be, I will be that, be more! SURREY Such lavish thought Makes you all that and more. And, ere nurse night Brings sleep into the battlefield and us, Here we will sit and talkâ LADY HERON Yes; talk aloneâ SURREY Of things that were, and things that are to be, As far as man can see them. But before Guerdon so welcome may befall me, I Must write unto my Sovereign Lord, King Harry, And tell him how his army fared to-day, My preconceivÃ«d moves and purposes, And fortunate fulfilment. LADY HERON Would you be Here, or within your chamber, for that task? SURREY That duty, rather. Here, so it be your pleasure, But now at once, wherever it may be. For there are mounted messengers who wait To speed them south, by rapid stage and change Of stirrup and self-spurring steed. LADY HERON Here then Remain, and I unwillingly will go, And leave you quiet to your victor scroll. But ere I quit you, just one little word! King James, when you had left me, hither came, And long while lingered. SURREY Here? And wherefore here? Was it to make a survey of the field From Ford's commanding towers? And did you letâ LADY HERON No! No! How wrongfully you misconceive! Swift on your going hence he hither came, In answer to my summons. Can you not Surmise the wherefore? SURREY Not unless it were For further ordering of his battle-ranks, And you were forced to tolerate his will. I blame you not. LADY HERON No, no, 'twas not for that. He cameâfor me! Came in soft amorous mood, A futile quest, as he hath come before. I for your sake decoyed and kept him here. SURREY How? For my sake? Here, for my sake? And why? In very sooth I understand you not. LADY HERON How slow of wit men ofttimes are! Why, sure, That he might sue, and linger, and be late! SURREY Late! And for what? You do not, cannot meanâ LADY HERON Late for the hurricane of battle, and so Your victory more swift, and safe, and sure! [Re-enter Margery.] SURREY How! Can it be that I have heard aright? O, you abominable woman, you! In what fell, dark, and execrable night Were you begotten, that should straight have been Stuffed out of living sight, a monstrous birth, And never thought of more; a lure, a lie, For honest men in their enfeebled hours. You have robbed me of my victory, James of life, And Scotland of her King! [She moves towards him, as though she would kneel and cling to his sword.] Touch not my sword! [Surrey shrinking from her.] And desecrate what is anointed still With sacred blood of trusting King betrayed. Were you a man, I would slay you where you stand, And rid the earth of such deformity. Away! I care not where, so you away, And cleanse the air by going. Nay, hide on In your foul ambuscade, Hell's loathliest hags Could not make fouler. By such fiends as you Undoing comes to men, and death to kingdoms. [Turns towards Margery.] Poor little maiden! so an you be wise, You will let me find you safer company And surer shelter. MARGERY I will stay with her, And tend her with such comfort as I can, Through woe, wrong, merciless or self-reproach, Till she be comforted. SURREY Office of charity Meet for your sex and years. But have a care You do not catch the leprosy from her, Whom you would cure! [Exit.] LADY HERON O, I have lost them both, One dead, one more disdainful than is death, More deaf, more deadly! Was it Surrey went? Where hath he gone? For thither would I go, Were it to join the doomed! Both lost! Both gone! While I am in this vast unfeeling world, I, feeling all! MARGERY Then, Lady, let me send For your liege husband, who will surely come. LADY HERON No, not for him! Then should I sin again, If I have sinned already. Be that all The bitter balm that you can offer me, Prithee be silent! If he came, my heart As at Heaven's very Judgment-seat would cry, âWhere, where is Surrey?â driving him afresh Where he is better than with such as I. O, 'tis a cruel and a captious world! Because I blazon forth what others hide, I am condemned. Aye, Surrey's self condemns me. For what? For loving. What is it he loves? Himself, his sword, his victory, his King, His cause, his countryâall of it, his, his, his! And Iâlove him! being thus the lesser thing, The lesser and the viler! Even now, It scarcely seems so. MARGERY I am not your judge, Neither is Surrey. If he be unjustâ LADY HERON Man always is. He whirls away our will With the convulsive currents of his own, And then, disdaining us for lightsomeness, Forthwith submerges. [Enter an English Gentleman-at-Arms.] GENTLEMAN-AT-ARMS Lady, I am bid By the Commander of the English Camp To bring a gift for you to look upon. LADY HERON Then, he relents! I knew he would relent. He could not be so hard to one so soft, Or stab to death one who but lives for him. [Re-enter Gentleman-at-Arms, followed by Four Soldiers carrying on their shoulders a burden with a military cloak cast over it, which they set down. Gentleman-at-Arms takes off the cloak.] GENTLEMAN-AT-ARMS Behold the gift! LADY HERON The body of King James! Take it away. 'Tis good for nothing now. It will nor kneel, nor fawn, nor sue, nor sing, And irks in death more than it did in life. GENTLEMAN-AT-ARMS (re-covering the body) Madam, I do as I was bid, and now Must bear it to the Scottish Capital, Where it awhile will lie in regal state, Ere it be piously sepulchred to rest With its long ancestry of Warrior Kings. LADY HERON Oâh! [Covers her face with her hands and turns away. The Soldiers withdraw, bearing away the body of James. Margery approaches her.] MARGERY Kneel with me, dear, and pray to One who will Forgive us all, James, Surrey, you, and meâ The Almighty Pardoner. LADY HERON Hence with such vain comfort! And I am in no mood to be forgiven! Where is his sword, that I may die on it? Gone with the wearer! He said that he would slay me! So he shall! Take him my body! Return gift for his! I still have this, given me that night, that night! [Seizes a dagger lying close at hand, and unsheathes it. Margery rushes to the door, calling âHelp! Help!â Seneschal, Donald, and Servitors rush in.] LADY HERON Help! Help! What use of help, when hope is none? Thus do I baffle help, and bid farewell To life, love, everything! [Stabs herself, and dies.] THE END</field>
