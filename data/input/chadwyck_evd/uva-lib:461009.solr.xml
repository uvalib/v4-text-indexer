      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I Scene, a wood near Magus's Cottage. storm. Magus solo. MAGUS. Now doth the vollied and rebellowing thunder Rock the huge earth, and all the dizzy hills Quake at his coming, while the arrowy bolt With ravaging course athwart the dark immense Comes rushing on its wings of fireâthe North With hoarse congratulation and wild threats Gives answer to his brother winds that rave From the three corners of the lurid sky. The spirits of past time are on the blast, They leave their misty halls to commune with The airy footed children of the stormâ Dimly they ride in gleaming steel upon The vaultings of their cloudy chariotsâ O thou omnipotent Love, whose boundless sway And uncontroll'd dominion boweth down The Spirits of the Mighty, thou great Despot, Who bindest in thy golden chains the strong And the imbecile, thou immortal Pan-Arch Tyrant o' th'earth and sea whose sunless depth And desolate Abyss is vivified And quicken'd at thy biddingâthou vast link Of the Creationâthou deep sentiment! Thou only to be understood by those Who feel thee and aid thy purpose, albeit I summon Into thy presence Beings whose dark brows Are furrow'd with the care of pride, whose natures Hold less congeniality with thine Than the condensÃ©d, cold compacted wave To a consuming fireâBut to my task! [He draws a cabalistic ring on the ground 'Tis well! Mishapen imp, Last born of triform Hecate, hear my voice! Stand forth and wait my summons, Spirit of Hell! [DEVIL starts up in the middle of the ring All hail! All hail! thou solitary power Whose habitation is the grisly flame Which guards that gate of Hell that looks along The measureless deep, whose inky waste divides The Evil and the BlestâNow weave thy web Of subtle machination, ply thy power In such a delicate and important cause As needs thy chief attentionâmark me well! DEVIL I come, O I come, at the sound of my name From the depths and the caverns of Hell where I lie, I can rush through the torrent and ride on the flame Or mount on the whirlwind that sweeps thro' the skyâ What wilt thou have me do for thee? Shall I weave The sunbeams to a crown for thy bald brows? Shall I ungarter the PlÃ«iades for thee And twist their glittering periscelides To keep the hose up on thy minishing calves? Shall I unchair Cassiopeia's brightness And fetch her close stool for thee? or pluck the Nanny-goat From off the back of that old blade whose haunches Quiver beneath the feather'd foot of Perseus? Shall I ungird Orion's strength, or bring thee A grinder of that mighty snake, whose folds Far stretching through the unconfined space Involve seven worlds? MAGUS A truce with thine heroics! A murrain take thine ill tim'd pleasantry! If thou are not the most impertinent Devil That ever smelt bitumen, pri'thee hear me. Affairs of high importance call me hence, No would I borrow of that usurer Procrastination, whose vast interest Is almost higher than his principal. Procrastination, like the wayward tide, With imperceptible and secret course Gains hourly on us till that we are left No landing place whereon to set our feetâ So lost and tangled is the maze of cares Protracted and put off from day to day. DEVIL What is the end and purport of thy words? And wherewith can I serve thee? MAGUS Thou shalt hear: For I forthwith upon the yeasty wave, With hasty expedition of swift oars Shall now embarkâbut to thee I commit (Until such time as I retrace my way) My loving wife, to guard her chaste and pure As stainless snow, brush'd by the windy wing Of Eagle on the stormy mountain top, Or like the virgin lily, whose rare sweets Combining with the ambient atmosphere, Do make a paradise of this fair earth, So delicate are its odours. DEVIL Gentle master, I would do ought but thisâI'd dive i' th'sea, I'd ride the chariot of the rocking winds Alarum'd by the thunder's awful knell, Or from the hornÃ©d corners of the Moon I'd pluck the charmÃ©d flowers that flourish there; I'd visit far Arcturus, the bright length Of the Ecliptic and the spangled Lyre, Or that dim star which in BoÃ¶tes' wain Shines nightly, or I'd bring thee gems from out The stilly chambers of the mighty deep, The boundless halls of porphyry, where sit The ancient fathers of the sea with beards That sweep the burnish'd chrysolite beneath 'emâ All this and more I'd do for thee, for these Are trifles to that weighty task, to guard A woman 'gainst her will. MAGUS This once, good Friend, Exert thy powerâthe task is shortâeftsoones I shall be here againâtill then farewell! [Exit MAGUS. Scene II DEVIL A very decent, tolerable taskâ Outwit a womanâthat were difficult; Place in one scale my graceless Devilshipâ Her ladyship in t'otherâweigh us both, I do much fear me lest her ladyship Untwist my meshes, foil my purposes And by her subtile intricacy of wit Mislead my choicest, noblest, nicest guile. The very fuscous and embrownÃ©d cheek Of his Satanick Majesty might blanch Before a woman's art. O Styx and Acheron! What deprecations, amulets and charms, What exorcisms, crossings and bead countings, What Ave-Maries will be play'd against me! I value not your amulets and charms The twentieth part of half a rotten murphy Or a split pea, albeit I do confess me I'm apt to turn tail on an Ave-Mary, And quail a little at a Pater-Noster, Except when it's said backwards. I remember me When I was summon'd up by this same Magus And unto this same office ('twas the dead Of a most chilly winter) that I lit I' th'grey o' th'morning on a blue nos'd Monk And pluck'd him by the beard, whereat he shrunk In all his sinews like a sensitive plant And chatter'd from the bottom of his cowl âApage Sathanas iniquissime!â Whereat I tripp'd him up and laid him prone Holding close conference with his Mother Earth About the damage of his splinter'd nose, And having punch'd him fundamentally With my strong hooves, I left him bruised and battered As a beefsteak. Scene III MAGUS There is nothing on all this earth that's precious To him who owns it, but Anxiety, With heavy Anthesis i' the other scale, O'er balances the pleasure on't: the rich ore Is mixed with so much dross we cannot separate it. There gleams no blue speck in the clouded waste Of the charg'd atmosphere (not more perchance Than is enough to make a butcher's surtout) But minute after minute threatens us, Lest in the misty wrappings of gray clouds We lose that island space of narrowing blueâ The man who hoards a casket, shuddering Will press it closer to his aching heart, If the deep reed bed should but tremble to The wind that strays thro' its rustling depths, or wave Its trembling shadows to the ambiguity Of moonlight. So it fares with him who knows The windings of the world and fain would cherish All that he loves from its intrusion: Distrust increases with increase of years, She is the firstborn of Experience And ye may know her by her stealthy shuffle And the keen gray twinkle of her deep-sunk eye And the rejectings of her anxious front To gaze at her own shadow. If ye greet her, Or pass your hand in hers, she will respond With an uncordial and relaxing grasp, As though she did repent her courtesy E'en in the doing o'tâbut from her counsel We learn that many a gay flower, which disperses Incense to every wandering air, fades off And grows to a poisonous berry, which gives death To all who taste itâthat the broider'd side Of Life's fair tapestry, with its woven groups Of gloomy imagery, and the inwrought splendour Of flower and fruitage, sheweth fair to the eyes Of inexperienced immaturity, But unto those whose rarity of locks The hand of Time hath salted, she exhibits The dark reverse of it, The intertwinings and rough wanderings Of random threads and wayward colouringsâ A mÃªlÃ©e and confusion of all hues, Disorder of a system which seemed Order. Yet never, in my gayest hour of Being, Was I so sanguine as to deem to my fate Would with each longing of impatient Hope Each gasp and indraw of the hasty breath Sparkle like Oroonoko in a tube, Which even as it ignites and inflames Doth change to bitter ashes. Scene IV Enter AMORET MAGUS Here Amoret, a word with thee! AMORET Proceed. MAGUS I am called hence by strong necessity. AMORET Alas! and when shall Heaven's auspicious breath Restore thee to these longing eyes? MAGUS Perhaps E're yet again the silver moon shall fill The curvÃ©d radiance of her glowing horns. AMORET How in thy tedious absence shall I chide The lazy motion of the lagging hours? Hours will seem days. MAGUS Sweet Amoret I would Thy tongue were not at variance with thy heart. AMORET True as the handle of the horologe, As ever moved by the works within, So move my lips responsive to my heart: True as the many-chorded Harp returns Harmonious answers to a master's touchâ So speaks this tongue congenial to my Soul. MAGUS It is not mine to draw aside the veil Of dark deception, or unmask the thoughts Of other mindsâMy Necromantic arts Could never teach me thisâsooner might I Transmute this bodily form into some shape Of wingÃ©d bird or lazy quadruped Or bloodless habitant of Ocean's wave. AMORET Alas! and why should false suspicion's breath, With such ill-omened and pernicious words Tarnish the lustre of my spotless fame? MAGUS I cannot trace the windings of a heart, The searchless windings of a woman's mind, For that Egyptian labyrinth famed of old With all its maze of avenues and chambers Were nothing to itâlike a lightsome feather When put in balance with a ton of lead. AMORET (weeping) What weighty cause, what reason have I giv'n That thou should'st treat me thus unkindly, Magus? Have I not lent to thee my youth, my time, And all that I possess? To thee o'er whom Full eighty suns have roll'd, while these young eyes Have barely seen a score, yet would I live Embosom'd in the fulness of content, Did not thy temper, fretful and morose, Still find new themes to harp upon and rail, Making the shadow of a sound reality, And the thin air solidity of substance, For thou art jealousy personified. MAGUS Pass not too harsh a judgment on me, Amoret. Causes however slight do oft give birth to The same effects as spring from weightier reasons. The little burning taper's tremulous ray And th'inexhaustible fount of fire which lives And emanates from the great Sun, would move The Dial's circling shadows equally. And, if thy nature in itself be fickle, Remember that the windy vane will veer To the Heaven's lightest murmuring, as well as To the strong tempest's chiding; one light word, One thoughtless look, may lead frail spirits as far As the vice pre-meditated. Who shall know man, or freely explicate The many folds of character? or who Shall bear the lamp of subtle scrutiny Into the deep recesses of the heart? Each Being is a world within himself, A complicated Engine, whose main springs Are circumstance and habit, and were this space Of limited life a chain of centuries, And each particular minute o't employ'd In the developing another's nature, 'Twere all too short for th'purpose. I have liv'd long and shall live longer, I Have mix'd with life in all its variations, I have visited the camp, the court, the mob, The riotous tavern, the unruly Hell, The penetrated hovel, the high palace, I have had friends and they were stedfast, enemies And they were bitterâI have wandered far From th'utmost Arctic to its opposite, I have seen the thievish Russ, the crusty Spaniard, The bold, brave Switzer, the freehearted Scot, The musical Italian, the proud Angle, The volatile, light-heeled Frank, the sleepy Turk, The money-loving and broad-bas'd Mynheerâ AMORET Illiberal innuendos and dark hints Are gender'd of suspicionâshe who views All objects thro' a mighty magnifier And multiplies to her diseased vision Accumulation of anxieties. MAGUS Well, Amoret, I will believe thee true And faithful as the compass to the pole. For in life's passage would I always look Upon that side of things which sheweth fairest, Else were our days but one continued gloom, A weary scene of surmise and mistrust. The breath of life blows chillingly enow To nip our sweetest hopes, and heaven forefend That we should waken bootless grievancesâ When the keen Ether is condens'd with frost Who would not cleave to th'sunny side o' th'wall? And hark ye, Amoret, one word of counsel! Close thou thy casement early, nor look down At sound of querulous serenade or flute Wooing the dewy wings o' th'midnight air To carry upwards on their whispering down Unto the gaping portals of thine ears Its soothing luxury of tender toneâ Regard not thou the glancing of the eyeâ The pressure of the handâthe easy lapse Of honey'd words from amatory lipsâ All this regard notâNow farewell; may Heaven And the good Saints protect thee! [Going AMORET The like wish Attend thee on thy way! MAGUS (returning) If I have said Ought roughly or in angerâ AMORET Think not of it! Once more farewell!â MAGUS Farewell, my own good Amoret, And if my humour should sometimes show testy, Impute it all unto the love I bear thee, Which effervesceth of its own intensity, And oftentimes mounts upward and boils over Because of its own fervour. [Exit AMORET Go thy ways! Thou yellowest leaf on Autumn's wither'd tree! Thou sickliest ear of all the sheaf! thou clod! Thou fireless mixture of Earth's coldest clay! Thou crazy dotard, crusted o'er with age As thick as ice upon a standing pool! Thou shrunken, sapless, wizen Grasshopper, Consuming the green promise of my youth! Go, get thee gone, and evil winds attend thee, Thou antidote to love! thou bane of Hope, Which like the float o' th'fisher's rod buoys up The sinking line and by its fluctuations Shows when the pang of Disappointment gnaws Beneath it! But to me are both unknown: I never more can hope and therefore never Can suffer Disappointment. He bears a charmed life and will outlast me In mustiness of dry longevity, Like some tough mummy wither'd, not decay'dâ His years are countless as the dusty race That people an old Cheese and flourish only In the unsoundest parts on't. The big waves shatter thy frail skiff! the winds Sing anything but lullabies unto thee! The dark-hair'd Midnight grant no ray to thee, But that of lightning, or the dreadful splendour Of the conflicting wave! the red bolt scathe thee! Why was I link'd with such a frowzy mate, With such a fusty partner of my days? Scene V (Enter DEVIL) [AMORET shrieks, covers her face with her hand and runs to the door. DEVIL brings her back and forces her into a chair DEVIL Madam! What's this? What? Railing? Fie! for shame! (Nay, sit you still and hear me.) Think you then To play Xantippe with impunity, Who gave her philosophical old spouse So choice and delicate a water bath To whet his appetite one frosty morning Before his breakfast? Do you hearken to me? AMORET Ye saints defend meâI shall die with terror. DEVIL. How, now, my dainty one, my delicate ward, My pretty piece of frail mortality, Where think you is the rendezvous of Saints, Where their celestial club-room, that you make A fretwork argent of your snowy fingers, And cast your jetty pupils up on high Until the blank, unanimated white Usurps the field of vision? A most unphilosophical conclusion! Point thy hands downward, turn thine eyes to the floor! There is a Heaven beneath this Earth as fair As that which roofs it here. Dost think that Heaven is local, and not rather The omnipresence of the glorified And liberated Spiritâthe expansion Of man's depress'd and fetter'd faculties Into omniscience? AMORET O ye Powers have mercy! DEVIL Have mercy, quoth'a! when had thy tongue mercy Upon thy betters, mistress? Curb it straightly, 'Tis the most dangerous member of the Bodyâ Unto the wise a blessing and a benefit, A healing balm of mild Persuasion, A sewer up of rents, sweet Pity's oracle, A curber of dissension's contumelyâ But in the mouth of the improvident Worse than an Adder's fang. It prompts the brain to hatch, the hand to execute, The heart to shake off conscience and the back To throw away the burden of restraint, The saucy foot to spurn Authority. Faith and troth, Madam, if my fates had bid me To tread the thorny path of life with thee, If the indissoluble, firm-knit chain Of fixed alliance in its sacred bond Had joined the fortune of thy stars with mine, Would I become a target of your taunts? The mark and butt of your unruly tongue? Would I be baffled, like the idle wave Fuming and fretting on a changeless rock, Without the power to make impression On the obdurate nature of the stone? Would I be hurried like the dust of the earth With every gale of passion to and fro, Or be the plaything of your haughtiness To gibe and sneer at? AMORET Hence! Avaunt, foul fiend! Bear hence the terrors of thy crooked horns And the long windings of thy sinuous tail! Oh! that I could speak Latin, whose magic sounds And Elfin syllables might drive thee far To thy remotest Hell. DEVIL Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Now by my Devilship 'tis wondrous plain, Plain as the polish of a marble floor, Plain as the surface of a bowling green, Plain as the nose upon a Negro's face, That husbands are the veriest dolts in nature. Ye henpeck'd mates, who, like insensate drones, Doze out your sleepy melancholy days, Who twist and twine beneath th'oppression Of woman's will, did ever Nature leave To man on earth a want unsatisfied? Has she not planted in each towering hedge That fronts the King's highway, in each green wood That crowns the balmy summit of the hill A sovereign remedy to curb the power Of overbearing insolence and pride? Ye are all wrapt in apathy, else where Would ARGUMENTUM BACULINUM be? 'Tis a most delicate physic, suited to All ages from the schoolboy to the wife. It quickens business, makes the lazy blood, Which heretofore was stagnant, circulate, 'Tis the primeval origin of virtue, Moulding the mind to good, it checks the freaks Of growing vice i' th'heart; corrects the hardness Of our ferocious natures like the iron Which when most beaten is most ductile; thus Men's natures are all malleable: should'st thou use them Mildly, they turn again and trample thee; But should'st thou hold and rein them straitly in, And curb the mettled nature of their spirits, When first they leave life's starting-post, they fear thee, And fearing honour, honouring obey thee, Obeying, love thee. Honour, love and fear All meet in a bamboo. Oh! Heaven and Earth! Why wilt thou crouch and bow and lick the dust Whereon thy consort treads? Beat back the stream And to the violence of the ridgÃ©d waves Oppose the massy stonework of thy power, Though for awhile it roar and bound above The opposition of thy barrierâ Yet raise thy dam up higherâhigher stillâ Till the submissive stream with silent course Seek its far fount. She'll never rave again, Unless in negligence or flexibility Of yielding nature thou should'st leave some avenue To her insinuating and sapping force, (Which will not leave one stone unturn'd, until She doth recover her dominion) Some faithless fissure or uncemented hole, Whence her ebullient spirit may leap forth, At first in an attenuated stream, Unto new contest, and enlarging straightly May hurry thy frail mound down its rough bed, And leave thee with one finger in thine eye To wail the pliability which led thee To trust thus far. AMORET I know not whence thou comest, Nor who thou art, nor what thy message here, Nor how I may exorcise thee, or drive Thy troubled spirit to its biding-place. If there be ought of pity in thy soul, I do beseech thee leave me to my thoughts And solitude. DEVIL Thoughts! Thoughts! what thoughts are thine But evil and dishonour? AMORET Nay, I'll kneel And pray thee to depart. DEVIL Out on thee, woman! Devils are faithful to their trust. AMORET Alas! Am I entrusted then to thee? DEVIL Dost weep? Is that a tear which stains thy cheek? Nayânow It quivers at the tip-end of thy nose Which makes it somewhat dubious from which feature It first had issue. AMORET I conjure theeâ DEVIL Tears! The rain of sentiment, the dews of feeling, The beads of sensibility! They are the coinage of a single wish. I know that ye can summon them at will. They are a woman's weapons, sword and shield, Wherewith she braves remonstrance and breaks heartsâ Those faithful sluices never are drawn dry. Even the withering heat of passion But leads them forth in greater plenitude. What! more! I know ye can command them, woman, Even to the precise number, ten or twenty, As suits occasionâ More yet? Methinks the cavity o' thy skull Is brine i' th'room o' brains. More yet? at this rate You'd float a ship o' the line. This is the cogent stream wherewith ye turn The mill-wheel of men's love (whose motion Guides all the inner workings o' the heart) And grind what grist ye please. AMORET I pray theeâ DEVIL Get thee to bedâyet stayâbut one word moreâ Let there be no somnambulations, No colloquy of soft-tongued whisperings Like the low hum of the delighted bee I' th'calyx of a lilyâno kerchief-waving! No footfalls i' th'still night! Lie quietly, Without the movement of one naughty muscle, Still as a kernel in its stone, and lifeless As the dull yoke within its parent shell, Ere yet the punctum saliens vivify it. I know ye are perverse, and ever wish, Maugre my wholesome admonitions, To run obliquely like the bishop at chess, But I'll cry âcheckâ to ye, I warrant ye I'll prove a âstalemateâ to ye. AMORET (half aside) In all conscience My mate is stale enough. DEVIL Do'st mutter? how? Would you outface the devil, Insolence? Or tweak me like St. Dunstan by the nose, Who scarified my smeller for a twelvemonth? Who would cast seeds i' th'ocean? who would graft Good counsel's fruits upon a stock so sterile? Oh! Amoret! there is no honour in thee; Thou art the painted vision of a dream, Whose colours fade to nothing, a fair rainbow Mocking the tantalized sight, an airy bubble, O'er whose bright surface fly the hues of light, As if to hide the nothingness within. Few will bear soundingâcast the plummet in And it will draw up mud, vile, worthless mud. Gaze on the mirror of the silver lake In its clear picture deftly pencilling The soft inversion of the tremulous woods, But probe it not to th'bottomâweeds, rank weeds, Darkness and swarming reptiles harbour there. Now go and ponder on my words. Begone. [Exit AMORET I am in troth a moralising devil, Quite out o' my element; my element, fire. Then come my spirit, with thy torch light up The strongest flame of thine ability, Use all thine effortsâwork thy passage, as The restless rushing of a fiery flood Within the hollow and sonorous earth. Now to my chargeâI must be violent, fierce, And put that ugly disposition on Which is my portion by inheritance From my great grandsire LuciferâGood lack! I'll make the scurvy-pated villains skip As they were mad, e'en though they thronged about me, As thick as Beelzebub on Beelzebub, Alias as thick as horseflies on horse-dung. 'Twill be a troublesome office. Nay, by Phlegethon, I'd rather be the chilly watch, whose voice Sounds midnight through the length o' the hazy streets In some great city, by the misty light O' th'fumigated moon, than guard a woman. When will the reign of feminine intrigues Of female politics and folly cease? It will be much about that time, methinks, When this dark field of earth shall be sow'd thick With the gay stars of Heav'n and the keen ploughshare Shall trench deep furrows in the inverted sky; When his triple mitred Holiness shall become An arrant Protestant, and all their Eminences Shall be unboiled into th'humility Of black canonicals; when a second Becket Shall thunder excommunication From out his lordly see of Canterbury; When Summer shall be Winter, and Spring Autumn; When cold shall rarify and heat condense; When Almacks shall become the rendezvous Of burly citizens and citizens' wives, And Lady Jây wearied shall throw down The reins of Fashion andâthink better things; When high soul'd man shall walk upon his head, When Colonel Bây shall shake hands with Decency And read or write a sermon. So! So! methinks in good truth I have hemm'd in My proposition with a sweeping circle Of insurmountable improbabilities. Yon taper sinks i' th'socket; Time wears quickly, Yet treads in shoes of felt. What is't o'clock? [Going to the timepiece Half after midnight! These mute moralizers, Pointing to the unheeded lapse of hours, Become a tacit eloquent reproach Unto the dissipation of this Earth. There is a clock in Pandemonium, Hard by the burning throne of my Great Grandsire, The slow vibrations of whose pendulum, With click-clack alternation to and fro, Sound âEVER, NEVER!â thro' the courts of Hell, Piercing the wrung ears of the damn'd that writhe Upon their beds of flame, and, whensoe'er There may be short cessation of their wailings, Through all the boundless depth of fires is heard The shrill and solemn warning âEVER, NEVER.â Then bitterly, I trow, they turn and toss And shriek and shout, to drown the thrilling noteâ [Looking again at the timepiece Half after midnight! Wherefore stand I here? Methinks my tongue runs twenty knots an hour: I must unto mine office. [Exit abruptly</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I [Magus's cottage with the wood and lake in the distance. Enter Devil and takes his station before the cottage door attired in a cap and gown. DEVIL The starry fires of yon Chrystalline vault Are waning, and the airy-footed Night Will soon withdraw the dismal solitude Of her capacious pall, wherewith she clouds Yon mighty and illimitable sky, Placing a death-like colour in all things, Monopolizing all the varied Earth With her dim mantleâ [A pause Oh! ye eyes of Heaven, Ye glorious inextinguishable lights, High blazing mid the lone solemnity Of night and silence, shall the poor worm, Man, The creature of this solitary earth, Presume to think his destiny enroll'd In your almighty everlasting fires? Shall this poor thing of melancholy clay, This lone ephemeris of one small hour, Proudly suppose his little fate incribed In the magnificent stars? What have the worlds Of yon o'er arching Heav'nâthe ample spheres Of never-ending space, to do with Man? And some romantick visionaries have deem'd This petty clod the centre of all worlds. Nayâeven the Sun himself, the gorgeous Sun, Pays homage to it. Ha! Ha! Ha! Poor Man, Thou summer midge!âOh, ye shine bravely now Through the deep purple of the summer sky, I know that ye are Earths as fair and fairer And mightier than this I tread uponâ For I have scaled your mountains, to whose cones Of most inusuperable altitude This Earth's most glorious Eminences and heights All pil'd and heap'd upon each other's brows, And massed and kneaded to one common substance, Were but a molehill. And I have swum your boundless seas, whose waves Were each an ocean of this little orb, Yet know I not your natures, or if that Which we call palpable and visible Is condensation of firm particles. O suns and spheres and stars and belts and systems, Are ye or are ye not? Are ye realities or semblances Of that which men call real? Are ye true substance? are ye anything Except delusive shows and physical points Endow'd with some repulsive potency? Could the Omnipotent fill all space, if ye Or the least atom in ye or the least Division of that atom (if least can dwell In infinite divisibility) should be impenetrable? I have some doubt if ye exist when none Are by to view ye; if your Being alone Be in the mind and the intelligence Of the created? should some great decree Annihilate the sentient principle Would ye or would ye not be non-existent? 'Tis a shrewd doubtâ [A sound of footsteps heard But softly! who comes here? What stealthy foot invades these secret woods? Tis some AlcinoÃ¼s or Eurymedon Who haunts this wild and wanton Amoret! Perchance some smooth-chinn'd Tyro just emerging From Hobbledehoyhood's twilight, and elated With the dark sproutings of incipient beard, Or some sleek monk enveloping the bronze Of his dark cheek beneath his rusty cowl. Now will I cloak myself, and thus conceal This grim, fantastic nose and these wide lips, That starting shew the black and knotty teeth That fence my jaws like hedge-stakes (I have lost Much of original beauty since my fall), Now will I smooth the harshness of my voice Into a feminine croak, tuck up my tail, And thus unsex myself. [Draws the hood over his face Scene II Enter Antonio ANTONIO Ye gracious Heav'ns Is't Amoret, the rosebud of whose cheeks Is preferable to a suit at Law Successfully unravell'dâthe rich sound Of whose harmonious and most silver voice Steals sweeter on mine ear than does the chink Of golden or of silver boys wrung out From the hard client's gripeâwhose delicate smile Is worth a ten day's fee? So! here I come To pay my devoirs at the shrine of beauty. For this, as soon as e'er the deep-mouth'd voice Of the most lonely tempest ceas'd to shake Heaven's pillars of the solid earth, I paced This wild and marshy wood; for this have burrs Clung to me as thou seest, more in number Than cases in the Court of Common Pleas; For this the drizzly trees and dripping shrubs Shower'd on me as I hurried past, more thickly Than diamonds on a birthnight. DEVIL (speaking in an undertone) Gentle Sir, You overrate yourself. True love had scorn'd The petty hindrances of wind and weatherâ Gods! why a lover is all heat and fire, A mustard pot, a very pepper-box, And his internal warmth of temperament Might guard him from external coldâAy! though Thou had'st bolted thro' the very teeth o' the storm Bareheaded, every gusty drop of Heav'n Had run off hissing from thy glowing surface, As from a bar of red hot iron. Believe me, If thou wert a true lover, wind and rain Would have no power on thee. 'Twas never known That one who lov'd most ardently and truly Was ever laid up for a single se'nnight With a red nose. ANTONIO Now on mine honourâ DEVIL Prithee, If thou desirest ought of credit with me, Most commendable and good Antonio, Swear not upon thine honour! It is rare With those of thy most honourable cut, As is the desert fire-born biped sprung From its own ashes. If thou swearest, swear By that thou lovest best. ANTONIO Then by my feesâ DEVIL Ayâthere the right nail's struck upon the head. ANTONIO Or by thy dearer selfâ DEVIL Now, prithee, lie not, Keep thy first oathâthy fees are dearer to thee. ANTONIO Well, by my fees (that I may honour thee And put an end to dissertation) I know a most true lover Leontio, That hath a nose as red as a skinned eel Or pickled cabbage steeped in vinegar, And flaming as a scarlet mailed lobster, Although he hath a lady in his head. DEVIL Then it proceedeth from the warmth within, Not from the cold without. ANTONIO How prove you that, Fair Amoret? the case is clearly mine, Let A be then the heart and B the nose, True love is centre'd in the heart. What then? It follows that the heat's in A the heart And not in B in the noseâPROBATUM EST. DEVIL Good Sir, the case is thisâthe lover's heart Is so o'ercharged with the secret flames That do consume its melancholy core, That all the superfluity of love, And the redundant heat, escaping thence, Take up their station in the lover's nose Which thence doth show like beetroot. ANTONIO SATIS EST; A truce to dissertation. Let us use More soft discussion, gentle paramour. Gaze all around theeâsee yon canopy Of the eternal boundless Heavensâyon host Of all the congregated starsâthis earth, This fair green plain of the luxuriant earthâ Breathe, fair one, breathe the soul inspiring air Full of the all-heavenly incense wafted from The groves, the fruits, the gaily-blooming flowers, Which the rough tempest hath but wak'd to beauty More fresh than heretofore. Is this a time For disputation? Starlight, incense, flowers, And two young loving hearts! DEVIL Talk not of love, Thou need'st must wait cessation of the stormâ ANTONIO What, harping on th'old string again? DEVIL Ay, Sirrah, Did not Leander swim the roaring main, The boundless Hellespont (as Homer calls it) On such a dark and dismal night as this was Half one good hour ago? ANTONIO And perish'd too. DEVIL Go toâthou art no lover! ANTONIO Thou beliest meâ I am an honest, true and proper lover, A gentle, comely, comfortable lover, A well-proportion'd and most gracious lover, As ever woman set her eyes upon. DEVIL Thou knowest that my spouse did journey hence At midnight, yet did'st thou delay thy coming Until the storm had swept above thine head. ANTONIO Inimitable mistress of my heart, I sate in judgment on my love and judged it, I issued out a WRIT against my conscience, And sent a MITTIMUS unto my soul, I tried and prov'd it thoroughly and found That it was free from blameâPROBATUM EST But come, unveil those eyes, whose dazzlingness Shoots forth more deadly and more certain shafts Than those the curly-headed Indian sends By force of breath from out the echoing tube. DEVIL 'Tis a chill nightâI fear the dampâI cannot Uncloak myself in such wise. ANTONIO Will it please you To enter in? DEVIL Proceed! I follow thee. ANTONIO Thy deeds do give the lie unto thy tongue, Thou art as motionless as Lot's wife. DEVIL Begone, On pain of my displeasureâhie thee henceâ I will attend thee in as many moments As there are peas in a pod or teats upon The gentle cow's most elegant dugs, or on Old Alma Mater, which are two or threeâ Albeit she hath the credit for some dozens. [Exit ANTONIO into the Cottage. DEVIL throws up his hood and proceeds Scene III. DEVIL Now, most sweet Sir, I have thee, Thou shalt repent of thine audacity Wherewith upheld, thus buoyantly and highly, Thou spurrest thy desire to lawless deeds Of bronze-brow'd arrogance, and darest thus To climb into the solitary fold Of thy good neighbour, and to cull the fleece Which he esteemeth bestâbut I will prove No tame, submissive, crouching centinel: But I will take such fearful hold on thee, As doth the wayward irritable crab On the poor travellerâthou art thoughtless, young, Full of high mettled hopes, hot blooded, sanguine, With haughty self-sufficiency of nature, Which is the attribute of thy green years That brook not sober meditation. Visions of happiness do float before thee, Gay-gilded figures and most eloquent shapes, Moulded by Fancy's gentle fingering To the appearance of reality, With youthful expectations and fond dreams, All rendered sunlike by the light of youth, Which glances on them, flit before thine eyes: But these shall be pinch'd out of thee ere mornâ There shall be no sound place within thy person; Thou shalt be all the colours of the rainbow, With bruises, pinches, weals, ET COETERA; And various as the motley colour'd slime, Which floats upon the standing pool, wherein Do breed all kinds of reptilesâcreeping things, Vile jellies and white spawn and loathsome newts. But come descend, thou penthouse: [Draws down his hood Hither comes One Pharmaceutus an apothecary, A mad, drug-dealing, vile apothecaryâ A thing of gallipots and boluses, Lean, lanthorn-jaw'd, splay handed, pasty fac'd, Hard favour'd and loose-jointed, ill proportion'd, Whose hips do roll on castors, and whose love Is nauseous as his physicâFaugh! I know not How I can keep my character. But here He comes and brings his fetid atmosphere About his person. Scene IV Enter PHARMACEUTUS. [Devil] Welcome, gentle Sir. PHARMACEUTUS Welcome, fair lady, may the bloom of joy And the medicinal virtue of all health Spread the fair carpet of thy roseate face With its gay colouring. DEVIL (aside). How cursedly He stinks of assafÅtida. Art cold? Dost shake and shiver? PHARMACEUTUS Marry do I. DEVIL What? Dids't not escape the tempest? PHARMACEUTUS No, i'faith, I am half palsied with frigidity, I'm below zero, I am perfect ice Congeal'd to all intents and purposes, My nose, my ears, and each particular toe, Will quit their stationâhark! my grinders chatter Like castanets, or fulling mills. Let's inâ And hark ye, some of Magus's brown stout; I'll smoke a pipe of comfortable shag-tail By the fireside with thee. Wilt let us in? DEVIL Ay, presently. PHARMACEUTUS 'Sdeath, Madam, instantly! Or thaw me with a look, a loving look From the full lustre of thy melting eyes! 'Sblood! thou art hooded and pent up as tightly As a sea-urchin. DEVIL Is't not fitting, prithee? Dids't thou not talk of nose dropping? PHARMACEUTUS Ay, Madam, The storm hath left a chill i' the air, 'tis damp, Rheumatic mists are whitening in the marshes, And pale-fac'd Ague wanders all abroad. But let us enter; eh? [Here ANTONIO half opens the cottage door and exclaims ANTONIO Where art thou, fair one? DEVIL Here, sirrah, with this gentleman! ANTONIO (coming forward) How now! What! with this scurvy rascal, this poor drug, This compound of all ugliness, this dog, This Ipecacuanha, this emetic, This wall-eyed monster, this anomaly, This piece of speckled parchment, this vile patchwork, Whose sallow and carbuncled face resembles A red design upon a yellow ground? PHARMACEUTUS Pills! plasters! powders! poultices! what now! ANTONIO Sirrah! I'll knock thy grinders down thy throat. PHARMACEUTUS (staggering backwards) Bole! Borax! Blister! Balsam! Bark! What now? ANTONIO Thou hocus-pocus of deformity! Thou scum! thou outcast of society! PHARMACEUTUS Galls! Garlick! ginger! guiacum! what now? ANTONIO I'll punch thee into jellyâscatter thee To the four Winds of Heav'nâthou scarcerow, thou! DEVIL Good wordsâsweet words, Antonio, prithee. PHARMACEUTUS Bless thee, My honey of squills, my oil of almonds, bless thee! Thou hast a good heart. ANTONIO How! you sorry rascal! Do you make love to the lady? PHARMACEUTUS Mercy on us! The man is madâhe must be blooded. ANTONIO How Do'st prate, thou vile anatomy? Bind up Thy jaws or by the Devil and his dam I'll make a gap within thy villainous throat And pour libations of thy wretched blood Unto this Goddess. What! thou fulsome scrag! Would'st thou make love with that untoward chin Hook'd and turn'd upwards like a Chinese shoe? PHARMACEUTUS Beshrew my heart but thou art wondrous mad, Mad as a March hare, and as hot as Cowhage Without molasses. ANTONIO Hang dog! DEVIL Peace, Antonio! Why, thou art 80, man, by Reaumur's scale, And more than twice as much by Fahrenheit, And the unconquerable turbulence And violent usage of your fiery temper, Expanded by the heat of passion, Will burst the tube of temperance. Methinks I am afraid to look upon you, lest Your head should part in twain, and thence should issue The subtle fluid which distends you so. ANTONIO Thou fairest excellence of what is most Excelling in all nature! loveliest mixture Of all that is most lovely! is it tolerable That this sad miscreant, this uncouth Behemoth, Thus monstrous in his vanity of mind, And loathsome in deformity of person, Each, render'd still more horrible by each, When thus contrastedâis it tolerable That he should raise the base and abject scum Of his vile thoughts so high, and thus presume To come within the rich and glorious sphere Of thine attractions? Fie! it must not be. DEVIL Did I not say that thou wert hotly rais'd By thine inexorable fire of anger As high as âWATER-BOILâ? ANTONIO Noâby the Law! It is but âSUMMER-HEAT.â DEVIL I prithee cloak not Thy faults beneath the colouring of fair names, Nor modify the wild unevenness Of thy capricious disposition With sounds of softest import: for i'faith Thy Spirits boil at least! ANTONIO That fusty wretch Hath roused them up to fermentation. PHARMACEUTUS Sir, You are as bitter as Alum. ANTONIO You, as foul As your own fÅtid pills. PHARMACEUTUS And you as brisk As bottled beer. ANTONIO Do you chop logic with me You dunderhead? PHARMACEUTUS Who? I, Sir? No, Sir. ANTONIO Sirrah! If thou presumest to give thy fool's tongue The damning license of a repartee, I'll have the substance of thy cursed brains Pounded and beat up in a red-hot mortar And with a burning pestle; of thine hide Will I make ass-skin breeches. PHARMACEUTUS Mercy on us! The man is hypochondriack or hystericalâ Here! here! bring spirits of hartshorn and burnt feathers And clap hot bricks to's feet! ANTONIO I'll knit thee up, And thou shalt hang in the mid-air as prettily As a vile cur that sucks hen's eggs, while I Will sing thy parting elegy, and thou Shalt beat the due observance of the time With thy unwieldy toes! Thou shalt be balanc'd As neatly as a difficult case between Two able pleaders! DEVIL Fie, Antonio, fie! Excess of violence becomes thee not, It sits as ill upon thy shoulders as Love on an old maid with a hump-back. ANTONIO Or On this same Pharmaceutus. Ha! ha! ha! PHARMACEUTUS Now by Hippocrates, by Galen, Celsus And the great Boerhaaveâthe dazzling sun And star of Medical scienceâI do think Thy wits are on the turn. Let's feel thy pulse, Is't feverish or low? Give me a fleshbrush That I may rub thee into senseâ ANTONIO How now! Thou most illiterate whelp, thou bristly cub, Whom thy great Mother Bear hath never lick'd To ought that may be called proportion! Why! thou dead idiot, woulds't thou thus behave As I were mad? in troth and faith I were so If I should bear with thee. I should deserve Commission of lunacy preferr'd against me By the Lord Mayor. PHARMACEUTUS Fair Sir, I do presume That you have heard the useful apothegm That âAnger is short madness.â ANTONIO Villainous wretchâ PHARMACEUTUS Here! pills of aloes! rhubarb! spanish soap! ANTONIO Would'st thou not madden ought beneath the sun With thine accursed clucking? PHARMACEUTUS Gentle Sir, Be not enragedâthe stormy voice of wrath, The lifting of the hand, the clenched fist, And the wild glare of the tumultuous eye, The broken interrupted words, which sound Hollowly, like a bruis'd tin-kettle ANTONIO Oaf! PHARMACEUTUS Th'inflation of the fiery cheeks, blown up With wind of idle passion, whence proceeds The flushing of the face like the red clouds Upon a blowy morningâ ANTONIO Loon! DEVIL Be still, Antonio, let us hear him out. PHARMACEUTUS All these Betoken anger which is madness. These Disorder all the animal functions, these Puzzle the progress of the chyle and hurt The process of digestion. ANTONIO Curses on thee! When the next sessions sit, i' faith I'll have thee Indicted for a publick nuisance to His Majesty's loving subjects. PHARMACEUTUS Now, by Galen, Thou art as fine a subject for Phlebotomy As ever came to my inspection. I prithee let me breathe a vein, 'twill do thee An ample service. [Here ANTONIO raises his fist to strike him Noânoânot the hand! I never bleed there, look ye, here's my instrument, The neck, the nape o' th'neck, Sir! ANTONIO The grim'd Imps Of Hell arrest thee at the Devil's suit! The red fiend ride thee into Chancery, Which is the worst curse I can vent upon thee! DEVIL A most ungentlemanly wish, Antonio, Deserving objurgationâA propos, The Devil is an ill thing to be jested with; What if he should be standing by thee now, Speaking as I doâdress'd as I am? What If HIS TENEBRIOUS BITUMENSHIP Should be in hearing o' thee? ANTONIO Why, my Amoret, Thou art an angel and he dare not ventureâ DEVIL A fallen one, I grant ye. ANTONIO If a fallen one, So many sparks of thine ethereal nature Yet linger round thee as to make thy presence A portion of the Heaven thou hast fallen from. DEVIL Older and wiser, my good counsellor, An hour may change thy humour. ANTONIO Ay, the section Of one small minute (if 'twere spent with thee) Nay, the minutest point of time in which The inconceivable velocity Of light can travel thro' one barley-corn Of the blue Ether, were enough to raise me (Providing always it were spent with thee) From out my present humour, which is that Of the strong sea when in its ridg'd advance Bruised by the inroad of a vassal river, Or an enchafÃ©d plaintiff face to face With the defendant. DEVIL In the mind of youth And pertinacious inexperience A hasty judgment sheweth like green fruit! The more unripe and immature it be, The harder clings it to its parent bough. ANTONIO Thou art the first o' thy sex that e'er found fault with The judgment of that man who call'd thee âAngel.â I am immutable in nothing, save The love I bear theeâbut behold who is't Comes swaggering hither? Why, what wants he here? Methinks he seems a sailor by his swing; His hat is cocked obliquely on his brow, One eye is null and void or shut in waggery, The never failing tokens of a rascalâ His arms are fix'd a kimbo, his left cheek Protruded by a quidâwhat varlet's this? Why wends he hither? Scene VI Enter STEPHANIO. STEPHANIO Blood and thunder, messmates, It seems I've run aground here. ANTONIO True! PHARMACEUTUS Ay, true! ANTONIO How! dost thou stand in bodily fear of us? STEPHANIO No, by the Devil and his dam! DEVIL (aside) That's I And mother Hecate. ANTONIO How is then thy case So ruinous and unwholesome? STEPHANIO Split my timbers! Thou art a lawyer and thus ruinous, And thou a nauseous apothecary, And thus unwholesome. Why! we sailors call Our sharks, sea-lawyers, and our lump fish, doctors. Have I run foul of ye? how got ye first Ahead o' me? Why! I came cutting hither With a fresh breeze i' my stern. ANTONIO With what intent? STEPHANIO Bound from the cape of hope to th'port of love, To win the prize in yon rich galleon there. ANTONIO What! can the heavenly essence of high love And all the little tendernesses, which Make up the catalogue of love, inhabit Such tenement as that thy breast affords? Why, art thou bona fide then in love? STEPHANIO I tell thee, fellow, I'm half drown'd in love. ANTONIO I'faith! I see that thou art half seas over. STEPHANIO How! you landlubber, do you banter me? My senses are all founder'd in deep love, My cables rotted and my timbers beaten In by the force of love! ANTONIO And wilt thou place Thy claim in opposition to mine? Oyer and terminer! what misdemeanour Wilt thou be guilty of? STEPHANIO And who art thou? Thou cock-boatâthou poor cock-boatâthou mere shallop Varnished and painted, whose weak delicate planks Would shrink beneath a cap full o' wind! PHARMACEUTUS But Iâ STEPHANIO And thou, sad, leaky, crack'd and bulging hull, Wilt thou too tow thy sluggishness within Reach of my bomb-shot? ANTONIO Marry! here come more To stretch the thread of my poor Patience Into so thin and spidery a fibre That it will crack, unless the vexing grasp Of these uncomely interruptions Relax the hold they've ta'en on'tâ What man of points is this who cometh first, In whose whole stature is no wavy line, No flexure but what is abrupt and sudden? His eyebrows have no arch, his hair is gather'd Conewise upon his squar'd and narrow brow, His thin dry lips seem parallel straight lines, His red and angular and shapeless nose Shows like a Gyron gules in Heraldry, And his sharp chin so narrow'd to a point, That if 'twere possible his neck could bend 'Twould perforate and pierce his collar bone. Scene VII Enter ANGULO, CAMPANO, BENEDICT ANGULO Most glorious luminary, round whose light, Attracted by thy Majesty of Grace We make our lowly revolutions, Exert not thy centrifugal force upon me But gently lead me to thee, by the power Of thy centripetal might, that so I may By due progression fall within thine arms! CAMPANO 'Faith, 'tis a garrison well âcurtainÃ©dâ! And it hath much of âcrown-workâ! STEPHANIO So say I. Ho! Madam, lower your colours! ANGULO Prithee, heed us Nor shroud thyself in envious eclipse! Thou seest we encompass thee like satellites! DEVIL Right, Angulo! and, sooth, it gratifies My woman's vanity to see ye stand thus, Myself the centre of the circle which My charms have bow'd unto my vassalage! But there be those among you upon whom My looks fall distantly, and those on whom The soft expression of mine eyes emits A nearer and more partial ray. ANGULO Nay, pardon meâ The radii of a circle are all equal Unto each other, my good Amoret, The centre of it equally remov'd From any point in the periphery. BENEDICT Take heed not of the ungodly! I do come To give thee ghostly consolation, But find thee thus encircled with a crew Of most ungracious sinners, led astray By machinations of the evil one. DEVIL (aside) True to a hair! BENEDICT Now, by our blessed Lady, Hearken not to these fleshly minded men, Vessels of wrath, the stumbling-blocks of life, (Whom God requite hereafter for their deeds!) But let us go and count our beads together. I have a piece of the true cross, inclosed In chrystal, which I'll show thee. [Pulling DEVIL after him STEPHANIO Avast! avast! hi! Get under weigh, my lads! what all at anchor? Yare! yare! you see he's towing her away. CAMPANO (to BENEDICT) And so you think to carry it by sap; We'll countermine you though. Halt, holy rascal! BENEDICT Ave Maria! what a speech was that! Off, sinner! look ye! here's the blessed Virgin! [Shewing her image Woulds't thou impede the saving of a soul? ANTONIO Why, who art thou, who with thy raisÃ©d forehead, Curl'd lip, and archÃ©d brow, woulds't beat us back, Squinting thro' thy green leeky eyes, and shaking Thy carroty locks, thus smoothly combed upon Thine austere frontâwho treadest on this earth As though thou wert not of it? who art thou? BENEDICT One that would hold no converse with thee. Off! My soul rejects thee, sinner, and my hair Doth bristle at thy gross impiety, like Some baited Boar when blown on by the breathings Of the rude dog. ANTONIO Thou hog in a high wind! Thou barrel-bellied sanctity! BENEDICT Avaunt! You excommunicated heretic! ANTONIO Oh! you tithe pig, and you would worm your way With that demurity of countenance, That frozen simulation of innocence Into your neighbour's strongholds? CAMPANO Not so fast, sir, We'll stick a cheval de frise within the breach And beat him backward. ANGULO Warring planets! Here's bullying Mars with front as red as fire. Here's Mercury and he's the hottest o'ye And also as they say, the prince of thieves With this old crafty Saturn who exceedeth The rest in bulk, and all at variance For Venusâwhy, who'll square the difference? STEPHANIO The ship yaws. DEVIL Gentlemen, this is not fitting That ye with noisy and contentious brawls And dissonance of tongues should thus disturb The sober, drowsy, stealthy-footed night, And rudely wake her echoes, shaking thus These peaceful dewdrops from the boughs above us. Rather come in and, if ye be inclin'd To exalt your voices, send them forth in songs, Glees, catches, merry madrigals, and such like 'Till the roof totter o'er ye! BENEDICT Be it so. 'Tis good to be afflicted. I will enter. ANTONIO The Devil take the hindmost! DEVIL Well said, lawyer! [Exeunt into the Cottage. Manet DEVIL Scene VIII. DEVIL O Race of Vipers, what should hinder me From crushing ye to nothing? O vile wasps, That flying round the honey'd vase dispute Who first shall dare immersion, could I take ye And dashing ye upon the earth could bruise Each impotent passion out o'ye, 'twere well; But if I left one spark of life in ye, The slightest glimmerings of existence, straightly Your teeming and prolific brains would hatch Conceptions of new vice, and, by and by, When the strong hand of chastisement relax'd, Ye would run down the steep ascent again Into the sink from whence ye were exalted, And would return to the forbidden thing With renovated zest. In after life Were punishment the herald of reform Th'infliction o't were good: but who shall fashion Clay that is hard and untenacious? Reform is rarer seen in after-life Than a rose i' th'brows of winter. Hark! I hear ye Head over ears in controversy and strife, I must unto ye and at any rate I'll thwart your present schemingsâ Bluebeard and Hickathrift! but I'll kick up The Devil of a Row, or more correctly The Row of a Devil. Belial, Abaddon, Astaroth, Asmodeus, Turn up your smoky eyes, ingrained with soot, And envy me the pranks which I shall play. Said I, Asmodeus? 'faith, he was a craven and a ninny and scar'd with the fume of fish-liver, which I do much marvel, whether it were own'd by Pike, Turbot, Salmon, or Sturgeonâor what fish liver ever possessed such puissant and devil-driving abilities. But, by Styx, they may broil half the fry that swims, before my Devilship would budge an inch. [Exit into the Cottage</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I (A room in the cottage, a table laid out with meats, wines, etc. DEVIL, ANTONIO, PHARMACEUTUS, STEPHANIO, ANGULO, CAMPANO and BENEDICT at table.) DEVIL Here! push the bottle to Antonio, He's a choice spirit, whose wit shows brightest when Burnish'd by wine. Drink sippingly, but not So as to surfeit th'senses; only kindle The combination of images From whose collision leaps the brilliant spark Of Heaven-born wit. ANTONIO Fair Amoret, I drink Unto the absence of thy loving husband. [To STEPHANIO Hark ye, Stephanio, ply the Monk with wine, Mellow his austere nature. STEPHANIO Mr. Benedict The bottle is with you. BENEDICT With me! O Shame! Take it away! it doth pollute mine eye-sight. The simple mountain stream that gusheth down The cavern doth suffice my natural wants And the few roots that spring uncultivated. ANTONIO Tush! man, thy fair round juicy corporation Doth give the lie unto thine utterance! An thou wert buried underneath an oak It were the goodliest tree in Christendom. STEPHANIO 'Tis a fine cargo of guts. ANGULO That is as plain As that two straight lines can't enclose a space, The angles of his elbows and his knees And all the other angles of his person Are all obtuse. Good living hath worn down Their natural acuteness. Both his haunches Are as the segments of a circle. BENEDICT Faugh! ANGULO And each particular hair upon his scull Makes up the shortest distance 'tween two points. I.e. are combed exactly straight upon his forehead. This is the definition which Archimedes gives of a straight line.â A. T. BENEDICT Avaunt! the upright shall not soil his speech To answer to th'ungodly. STEPHANIO Ay, is't so? Then, Master Benedict, d'ye hear, bring to, Unless thy weighty flanks desire bombardment, Although, i'faith, good Nature gave thy carcase Broadside enough. But, rot me, once for all Drink or be d?d. BENEDICT The righteous were made To suffer persecution. STEPHANIO Drink onâ BENEDICT Hush! Blast not my hearing with thine obscene oaths. Sooner than listen to them, I, by drinking, Will do a violence unto my natureâ Not that I love the carnal taste of wine, For the Lord knows I'll only wet my lips That I may stop your execrations. [Drinks off the bumper ANTONIO Bravo! take heed, he only wets his lips! PHARMACEUTUS A little wine in moderation Doth brace the nerves and lend the flagging spirits A healthful tonic and decent gaiety. ANTONIO Would it could brace thy person. PHARMACEUTUS Or mend thy temper. ANTONIO Make thy hips firmer. PHARMACEUTUS Or thy tongue less voluble. DEVIL Fie, Gentlemen, no brawls! STEPHANIO Fair Excellence, Thou hast held out long enough. I prithee now Capitulate on honourable terms, Disclose the dazzling windows of thine eyes, Display the rosy banners of thy cheeks, And open the port cullis of thy lips, Within whose crimson tenement are rang'd Thine ivory files of teeth. Consider, prithee, How shall the airy ardent kiss make way Through the thick folds of that dark veil, which bars All access to the fortress of thy soul. ANTONIO Ay! Ay! unveil. ANGULO Disperse thy ânebulÃ¦.â DEVIL Ay and the nebulones that surround me. ANTONIO Thou wert not used to such reservednessâ Veil versus BEAUTY is a case which will Admit of many pleadings. DEVIL 'Troth, I dare not Unveil lest ye should quarrel for my nose. (Aside) (No fear of that methinks) and make partition Of all the other features of my face. ANGULO And think you that we would bisect your visage? ANTONIO Will you not face us? DEVIL Nay, I cannot countenance ye. ANTONIO Prithee unveil! why, only double-faces Do lurk beneath a veil. DEVIL And said I not You wish'd to halve my physiognomy? You hint that I am double-faced and hence 'Tis plain you wish that half my face were off. ANGULO Equals from equals taken remain equals. DEVIL Let me have no divisions on the point. ANGULO A point hath neither parts nor magnitude, Thy face hath both and therefore is no point. DEVIL From thine own wit I judge thy wit is pointless, For thou hast parts and therefore lackest point. ANTONIO How should his inability proceed From his ability? If he hath parts Then is he not without ability, But if his language hath no point in it, Then his ability is null and void. ANGULO Which is absurd. ANTONIO Can'st solve it? ANGULO I say still A point hath neither parts nor magnitudeâ DEVIL But this is size-point and hath parts and magnitude. ANTONIO Thou art as full of point as a woolcard, Amoret. DEVIL But you are âcontre-pointâ and meet me halfway. CAMPANO The devil take discussionâthat bears point-blank. STEPHANO I wish the point were doubled. ANTONIO Nay, i'faith We've had enough on't. [Here BENEDICT helps himself What, old Confidence, Thou top and Pink of all Morality, Thy taste improves then. Marry, but I had Some shrewd suspicion that that demi-circle Of entrails was bow'd out with better stuff Than herb and biscuit. BENEDICT Aâavaunt IâI will not heed the unrighteous. ANTONIO Thou dost not like the carnal taste of wine? ANGULO How the saint reels about his centre of gravity, His spine subtends an arc of ninety degrees. STEPHANO 'Faith he hath no small matter in his hold, He'd keep both pumps at work, I warrant him. DEVIL I pray ye, Gentlemen, give ear to me, It is my wish that e'er I do unveil The ineffable magic of my charms, that each In turn should chaunt some love lorn madrigal Some amorous ditty which may give him scope To laud with Love's exaggeration Unto the height of his ability My loveliness of feature: after which To him whose strains are sweetest and whose praise Sounds softest to the ear of vanity I purpose the unveiling of my beauty And will admit him to snatch as many kisses From lips, cheeks, eyebrows, forehead as he wish Ad libitum. Doth it hit your fancies? ANTONIO Ay! Certes, fair Amoret: Shall I begin? My voice is sweeter than the chink of silver. CAMPANO Mine louder than the bugles' clamour. ANGULO And mine Falls with more regular cadence thanâ STEPHANIO And mine's Like any cannon. DEVIL What saith Benedict? BENEDICT My voice was ever yet employed in psalmody. PHARMACEUTUS But mineâ ANTONIO What! thine! the clicking of thy tongue Upon thy worn-out palate doth resemble The livelong hammering of thy cursed pestle Upon the druggÃ©d mortar and doth surfeit Our hearing, as thy physicks do our taste. DEVIL Antonio, prithee sing first. ANTONIO Why, then, here goes! By Jove, I'll warble like the captive thrush. Thou hast cast over me the golden net, The all subduing trammels of strong love. My soul is held in such sweet thrall by thee Had I the power I would not grant it bail, Therefore, sweet Excellence, my strains shall be Most like the imprison'd linnet's. DEVIL Prithee, gaol-bird, No prelude to thy warblingsâquickâdispatch. STEPHANIO I can roar out a catch with th'best o'ye. ANTONIO If thou presumest to exalt thy voiceâ STEPHANIO Avast! Avast there messmate! Anchor quietly. What! do you bear against me? Put about ship Or ere a hand can reef the mizzen top-sail, I'll lend thy stern so warm a cannonading As peradventure, man, may make thy bowsprit Drip with salt water. DEVIL What, Stephanio, Would'st print the booted fury of thy five toes Into his yielding carcase? STEPHANIO Marry, would I. PHARMACEUTUS (whispering STEPHANIO) Ay, do't, Stephanio, prithee, do it now. He lacketh salutary chastisement. ANTONIO Thou woulds't not meddle sure with my entailments. CAMPANO How! woulds't thou violate his back settlements? STEPHANIO What! do you side with him? do you back him? CAMPANO No, Not his back-side. ANTONIO If thou but stirrest one finger Or look'st upon me commandinglyâthus, I'll let more light into thy skull than ever Shone there of nature, with as rude a polt As ever cudgel-swinging bumpkin lent His blue and batter'd brother-labourer. ANGULO There will be âVulgar Fractionsâ then, methinks. ANTONIO So! So! you thrust your tongue into your cheek As if you doubt my prowessâWhy, come on then! Dost think a lawyer hath but legal weapons? Can'st toddle to the scratch? I'll sew your sees up! I'll Chancery your upper tenements. I'll file and bore you scientifically. I'll make the patchwork peep, I warrant you, Disorganise your victualling-office, uncork The claret of your nob, and dim your daylights, And make your ivories chatter in the tusk-box. STEPHANIO I'll bring my guns to bear on ye enow, I'm only gathering wind before I crowd sail. ANTONIO Ay, ay, for every mugger thou shalt give me, I'll lend thee ten and ten and ten to that. ANGULO Oh! a recurring decimal. STEPHANIO Come, unrig. ANTONIO I am your man. DEVIL (coming behind) And I your woman, Sir. (Trips him up) ANGULO Quod erat demonstrandum! STEPHANIO Ha! Ha! founder'd! CAMPANO He hath received some damage in his rear, And total rout unto his advanc'd guard. ANTONIO How now! the devil! Amoret! DEVIL The Devil's Amoret Is a good part if done in character. The Devil Amoret! the Devil, Sir! I was an Angel twenty minutes since, Did I not say that you would change your humour? ANTONIO Assault and battery! DEVIL Ha! Ha! Ha! Antonio, And would you swear me in to keep the peace? PHARMACEUTUS It was a bad concussion. Shall I bleed you? ANTONIO I am bedevil'd and bewizarded. DEVIL And have you not the grace to say âbewitchedâ? ANTONIO Methought a Giant grappled meâWhat spells Have put such thew and sinew in an arm Whose rounded purity seem'd only able To string a necklace or to clasp a bracelet? DEVIL What! have I tickled you? your nose drops blood. STEPHANIO How! hath he sprung a leak? hath he bilg'd? ANGULO He hath prov'd The law of gravitation lustilyâ And yet, methought, the vacuum in his skull Might have buoyed up his carcase to some purpose. STEPHANIO He pitches bravely. ANTONIO Murrain take ye all! Am I a shrovetide cock that ye should crack Your jests upon me thus? but I'll not stand it. DEVIL No, 'faith, you measur'd all your length just now. ANTONIO What do ye take me for? ANGULO A baffled lawyer Diverging from the perpendicular Which you have done before nowâ BENEDICT Yea, by 'r Lady, He hath swerv'd from rectitude. ANTONIO O chattering Apes, Do ye make mouths at me? do ye snap your fingers As ye esteem'd me less than th'heated air Whose rarefied attenuated substance Would scarce endure the thistle beard to sport Upon its yielding subtlety? then, here's for ye, I value not a single soul among ye The interest which one poor farthing yields I' th'fraction of a second. ANGULO How! COMPANO What! STEPHANIO Do you brave us all? ANTONIO Ay. STEPHANIO Split myâ DEVIL Hist! [Knocking ANTONIO O Lord, the Necromancer! BENEDICT Holy Virgin Defend us! ANTONIO We shall all be cats or foxes. STEPHANIO 'Twill blow a rough gale. [Knocking BENEDICT Saints deliver me! I'll never do an evil thing again. ANTONIO I'll never nim a client of his due. PHARMACEUTUS I'll never kill a patient any more. STEPHANIO Would I were safe i' my hammock, out at sea! PHARMACEUTUS Would I were mixing draughts or rolling pills. DEVIL Wishes prove nothing but the vanity Of him that wisheth: though, like telescopes, They bring far things awhile beneath the view, They cannot 'minish the long interval And space between the object and the wish. [Knocking Quick, quick, be expeditious, Gentlemen. Look ere you leap but tarry not in looking, Were a good proverb. A quick decision i' the nick of time Outruns mature deliberation As the strong gush o' th'tide in some strait river Precurses the more sober ocean. You mount the chimney, Benedictâwhat now! Do you stick fast in't? doth its sooty breath Offend thy proud olfactories? Up farther, My ghostly chimney-sweep. I warrant this Is not the first time you have made a chimney The medium of intrigue. Up farther yet, Work thy way inward. Hark ye! Pharmaceutus, Stow your long body cheek by jowl with Angulo Within the closet yonder. You, Campano, Cower down beneath the heap o' musty sacks There i' the corner with Stephanio. You i' this chest, my worthy Counsellor, Must with contracted stomach chafe your knees. So! So! ye are all safe now. [Loud and continued knocking I prithee, patience. Scene II Outside of the cottageâearly morning. MAGUS I do much fear my Devil hath play'd false Or that the weeds of wanton Idleness Have mantled his clear wit. Why comes he not? There is no punishment too sharp for him That doth forsake his trust, betray the station Where we have set him in Authority. If the frail reed we lean upon should break, Where most we hope its succour, it were meet That we should hew it from the wholesome Earth Which nourisheth and perfects better things. If he should answer my suspicions, I'll pen him for some centuries in ice Up to the neck, I'll rack his thumbs with screws; I'll twitch his tail until the black blood spout Forth at the end; I'll fill his jaws with tooth-ache; I'll stick hot pins thro's liverâHark! he comes. [Enter DEVIL, still veil'd Ha! Amoret, awake, abroad so early Blanching the roses of thy cheeks. What now! The grey cock hath not crow'd, the glow-worm still Leads on unpal'd his train of emerald light. DEVIL Good faith, most venerable necromancer, The roses of my visage are not blanch'd But rather have attain'd (be thou my judge) Unto a depth of dusky colouring. (Unveils) MAGUS How now, my Hellish Minister, dark child Of bottomless Hades; what rude waggery What jejune undigested joke is this? To quilt thy fuscous haunches with the flounc'd, Frilled, finical delicacy of female dress. How hast thou dar'd to girdle thy brown sides And prop thy monstrous veterbrÃ¦ with stays? Speak out, thou petticoated Solecism. Thou hairy trifler! what mad pranks have sent Thy diabolical wits a wool-gathering? DEVIL A linen gathering I grant you, Master. MAGUS Certes, it seems your Devilship to-night Is unaccountably facetious! Speak and beware the magic of my spells! Or I will rive yon mighty Cedar-Tree Sheer from its topmost windiest branch unto The lowest fang o' th'rootâbetween each half I'll place thy sinful carcase and again When the cleft stem shall close without a fissure Thy bunching body shall be quash'd as flat As spider in a hinge. DEVIL Nay, pritheeâ MAGUS Speak, then, And tell me why thy horny scalp is thus Envelop'd in the foldings of this veil? DEVIL Why lurks the Bravo's dagger in the sheath Ere yet it glitter o'er his enemy? Why is the curvÃ©d fish-hook buried in The length o' th'twisting worm? My gudgeons play Around the baited snare. My horny scalp Is buried in the foldings of this veil To save thy scalp from horns. MAGUS Ay? is it so? Good Devil bear with me. My nature is Most quickly mov'd to anger which as quickly Is wasted like the flint o' th'veiny Earth Which underneath the hoof one moment flashes A particle of intense fire which dies As instantly. But wind and wave have chafed me, The Anarchy of the impetuous blast And the wet beatings of the step-dame surge Have ruffled my smooth temper. DEVIL Gentle Master, Unless thine oars had been swift wings, thy boat Some pinion'd steed of air, thine ocean-path The limitless abyss of Ether's space, I know not how thou hast measur'd back thy way So keenly. MAGUS Half the powers o' th'other world Were leagued against my journeying: but had not The irresistible and lawless might Of brazen-handed fix'd Fatality Oppos'd me, I had done it. The black storm, From out whose mass of volum'd vapour sprang The lively curling thunderbolt had ceas'd Long ere from out the dewy depth of Pines Emerging on the hollow'd banks, that bound The leapings of the saucy tide, I stoodâ The mighty waste of moaning waters lay So goldenly in moonlight, whose clear lamp With its long line of vibratory lustre Trembled on the dun surface, that my Spirit Was buoyant with rejoicings. Each hoar wave With crisped undulation arching rose, Thence falling in white ridge with sinuous slope Dash'd headlong to the shore and spread along The sands its tender fringe of creamy spray. Thereat my shallop lightly I unbound, Spread my white sail and rode exulting on The placid murmurings of each feathery wave That hurried into sparkles round the cleaving Of my dark Prow; but scarcely had I past The third white line of breakers when a squall Fell on me from the North, an inky Congress O' the Republican clouds unto the zenith Rush'd from th'horizon upwards with the speed Of their own thunder-bolts. The seas divided and dim Phantasies Came thronging thickly round me, with hot eyes Unutterable things came flitting by me; Semblance of palpability was in them, Albeit the wavering lightnings glitter'd thro' Their shadow'd immaterialities. Black shapes clung to my boat; a sullen owl Perch'd on the Prow, and overhead the hum As of infernal Spirits in mid Heaven Holding aerial council caught mine ear. Then came a band of melancholy sprites, White as their shrouds and motionlessly pale Like some young Ashwood when the argent Moon Looks in upon its many silver stems. And thrice my name was syllabled i' th'air And thrice upon the wave, like that loud voice Which thro' the deep dark nith i' th'olden time Came sounding o'er the lone Ionian. Thereat I girded round my loins the scarf Thy Mother Hecate gave me and withstood The violent tempest: the insulting surge Rode over me in glassy arch but dar'd not Sprinkle one drop of its nefarious spray Upon my charmÃ©d person: the red heralds O' th'heavy footed thunder glanc'd beside me, Kiss'd my bar'd front and curl'd around my brow In lambent wreaths of circling fire, but could not Singe one loose lock of vagrant grey, that floated To the wind's dalliance. But nor magic spells Vigour of heart or vigilance of hand, Could back the Ocean's spumy menacings, Which drove my leaky skiff upon the sands. Soon as I touch'd firm Earth, each mounting billow Fell laxly back into its windless bed, And all the moon-lit Ocean slumber'd still. Thrice with bold prow I breasted the rough spume But thrice a vitreous wall of waves up sprung Ridging the level seaâso far'd it with me Foil'd of my purpose. Some unwholesome star, Some spells of darker Gramarie than mine, Rul'd the dim night and would not grant me passage. DEVIL Thou hast come fittingly. MAGUS How so? DEVIL My plans Are growing to a head. MAGUS And hast thou guarded With scrupulous exactnessâ DEVIL Grant me but The tenth part of an hour and I will mesh In the entanglement of stratagem These lawless insolents; thyself shall take That vengeance which thou wishest. MAGUS Who are within? DEVIL Water and oil. MAGUS What mean you? DEVIL Salt and pepper. MAGUS Be less ambiguous. DEVIL A most warring compound Of uncongenial elements, good Master. 'Faith, seldom doth thy dice box, Intercourse, Turn up such rude unmated numbers. MAGUS Ha! Where's Amoret? DEVIL Asleep. MAGUS Art sure? DEVIL Most certain. MAGUS 'Tis well. I wait without. What signal, prithee, Shall summon my approach? DEVIL A beat o' th'foot, or The shrill collision of my palmsâthusâthrice, or A clearing of the throatâthusâmeaningly. MAGUS I will be sure to mark it. Get thee gone And do thy bidding, Devil. [Exit DEVIL 'Tis even thusâ And they would pluck from th'casket the sole gem Of mine affections, taint its innocent lustre, And give it back dishonour'd, they would canker My brightest flower, would muddy the clear source Whence flows my only stream of earthly bliss; Would let the foul consuming worm into The garner of my love. O Earthliness! Man clambers over the high battlements That part the principalities of good And illâperchance a few hot tears, and then The sear'd heart yields to 't and Crime's signet stamps Her burning image there. The summer fly That skims the surface of the deep black pool Knows not the gulf beneath its slippery path. Man sees, but plunges madly into it. We follow thro' a night of crime and care The voice of soft Temptation, still it calls, And still we follow onwards, till we find She is a Phantom andâwe follow still. When couched in Boyhood's passionless tranquillity, The natural mind of man is warm and yielding, Fit to receive the best impressions, But raise it to the atmosphere of manhood And the rude breath of dissipation Will harden it to stone. 'Tis like the seaplant Which in its parent and unshaken depths Is mouldable as clay, but when rude hands Have pluck'd it from its billowless Abyss Unto the breathings of Heaven's airs, each gust Which blows upon 't will fix it into hardness. I'll to the Northern casement which looks over The shrubby banks o' th'mountain Lake, for thence The slightest whisper from within may reach me. Scene III Interior of MAGUS' cottage. Enter DEVIL. DEVIL O ye puissant spirits whose tried powers The issue of this night hath fully prov'd, Though your undoubted prowess hath descended In dearth of other merriment to play At hide and seekâcome forth! STEPHANIO (Whispering from under his sacks.) Is the coast clear? Has he heel'd offward? ANTONIO (Half raising the lid of the chest.) Is the sorcerer gone? DEVIL âAwake, arise, or be for ever fallen.â CAMPANO What! did he beat a parley with thee, Amoret? Or did ye sally forth, and nail his Ordnance Ere it had vent? BENEDICT (Up in the chimney.) The Lord deliver me! That ever Benedict should come to this! DEVIL Out of your holes, ye Rats! uncavern ye, White-liver'd conies! ANTONIO Why, thou art a Shrew. DEVIL Nay, give the Devil his due, I am not shrewish. ANTONIO Beshrew me, if thou art not. Where is Magus, And his familiar? DEVIL Fear, like Drunkenness Sees ever doubleâthere was only one. 'Twas an old suitor whom I had discarded, A miserly craving man, whose white hairs preach Against his manners. One who hath heap'd up coin until the means Became the end of being; his hair was lac'd With cobwebs, his sad calculating brows Gather'd into a hundred dusty wrinkles. A rusty key with many less ones dangled Beside him, his parch'd person showed most like A disembowell'd Mummy or dried Moth. There was no moisture in his fissur'd lip. He thrust his shrivell'd fingers into mine, And mumbled from his dry and corky tongue Some sentences which intimated Love, But sounded like chaf'd parchment or the whistle Of tight and corded Inexpressibles. Ev'n such an one so sapless and so wither'd I clos'd my door upon. BENEDICT (Groaning in the chimney) Beate Martin! ANTONIO He calls for Betty Martin. DEVIL And he'll find her For she is marvellously fond of soot. PHARMACEUTUS (Who has advanced into the stage with ANGULO.) Did you speak verity, my oil of Roses? Who shook the door so keenly? ANGULO Ay, good mistress, Are we correct i' th'data? DEVIL Know you not Philargyrus, to whose roof the sparrow's nest Owes not a straw that lines it? PHARMACEUTUS Know him? Ay, A weak, old patient with a thready pulse, And dry unfruitful palm, which lacketh ever The wholesome dew of perspiration. But I much marvel how he knocked so briskly. DEVIL He was enrag'd we did not open to him: And irritation often times doth nerve The puny frame with artificial strength. A child in wrath will cast a heavy stone, Which in his tamer mood he scarce had mov'd. But to the point! We tarry long in colloquy, The cool and pearly grey of dawn hath crept Into the sable bosom of the night. It were fit time that I should call from ye The man that hits my fancy. PHARMACEUTUS Wilt unveil then, My liniment of Linseed, my Electuary, My syrup of Poppies, eh? my flower of sulphur? DEVIL (Aside) That's a home touch, though but a random hit. My flower of sulphur quotha! by the Cabbala A pretty flower of sulphur shall ye find me. My thoughts begin to burn: a Devil's heat Glows through me to the core: have at ye, Sirs! Here the manuscript ends abruptly.â Ed.</field>
