      <field name="fulltext">ALICE. A DRAMATIC SCENE. The scenery of this little drama is taken from the beautiful grounds of the Great House at Arborfield, near Reading. The characters and the story are entirely fictitious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. Mrs. Neville. Henry. Alice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene.âA path by the side of a river. Henry in the foreground; Mrs. Neville and Alice under some trees at the side. Henry. This is the spot so loved, so long unseen! The very spot! the brimming Loddon here, Winding through grassy fields, gives back the blue And dappled sky so brightly, that it seems Part of another Heaven. There is the mill, Thwarting its courseâthe old and rustic mill, With its white low-browed cot, and wooden bridge That seems, yet is not, dangerous; there the church With its square tower; and nearer that vast pile Whose pointed roofs and porch and pinnacles And carved and massive windows give a date Prouder than the huge oaks which overtop The clustered chimneysâcold and cheerless now! No wreathing smoke bids welcome to the old Ancestral hall, vacant and desolate, But beautifulâhow beautiful! The shrubs Grown into trees and blossoming profuse, As in those flowery forests where they live Seen but of Heaven.âAh! beneath the treesâ 'Tis they! It must be they! That slender woman, Bending her fair and patient cheek o'er work Scarce whiter than her handsâthe widow's capâ The close grey gownâthe undying lovelinessâ It is herself! And that young graceful girl, Nor child nor woman, who in colourless And sculptural beauty stands, severely pure, Pale as a water-lilyâthat is Alice! Her eyesâwould I could see her eyes!âare sealed On that unconscious book.âI'll speak to them. (Advancing to Mrs. Neville and Alice). Madam, I pray you pardon me!âThis path, So green and overgrownâdoth this path lead To Cleveland Hall? Mrs. Neville. It dothâalas! it did. The hall is silent now and tenantless; None treads the moss-grown road. Henry. What, is there none Within the inhospitable walls, to cheer The poor man's heart? Not one to ope the gate To curious strangers, or the humbler wants Of the sick way-worn traveller? What, none? Not even a servant? Mrs. Neville. None. You lean your head Against the trees, as sick or weary too. Oh, rest you here awhile! Find such a seat As mine, midst these old roots; and if you need Refreshmentâ Henry. Stir not, Madam! my weak words May ill express strong gratitude. To sit Here is the perfectest repose; amid Such shade, such freshness, where the greenness falls Like dew upon the burning eyes; such smells Swinging from the lime blossom, and the breath Of flaunting woodbines; and such coil of bees Gathering their harvest. It is worth a life Of that dull common joy which men call bliss, So to be weary, and to find such rest. Mrs. Neville. You come from far? Henry. From Oxford here, to meet The heir of yon fair hall. Alice. Ah! he knows him! Henry (aside). Now those stars shine upon me! Alice. You know him! Mother, he knows Lord Claremont. Mrs. Neville. Oh, the book Is closed, which this long morning hath absorbed Thy every senseâthou hast not seen thy young And dear companions, when they wooed thee forth To the gay hay-field; hast not heard my voiceâ Not though that voice called Alice. Alice. Not heard thee! Mother, not thee!âOh fie upon thy charm, Sweet poesy!âNot hear thy voice! Henry. What lay Hath such enchanting power? (She gives him the book). The FaÃ«rie Queen! Oh gentle poet of the summer sky, The fresh air, the green earth! how suited thou To this wild pastoral scene, and this young hand Trembling with modesty! Mrs. Neville. She'll hang all day Over that tale of Una. Henry. But this shower Of snowy rose-leavesâsure it was her mark!â Dropt from that tenderest page, where Britomart, Pining for love, heartsick and desolate, Is by her old nurse comforted and cheered, And hushed to sleep like an o'erweary babe. Euripides himself, in the famed scene Of PhÃ¦draâno, nor Shakspeare, when he melts The very soul with Juliet's tender woeâ Touched not more truly the witch-notes of love Than that old simpleness. Mrs. Neville. Yet Britomartâ Alice, it was a silly maid that loved A picture. Alice. Mother, no! Oh no! She loved The high idea, the bright imagining Of her own soul. Gentleness, valour, truth, And lofty faith, and noble thoughtâ'twas these She loved; the magic image did but clothe, But lend a form to the diviner mind Which her pure fancy moulded. Henry (aside). Now she stoops To kiss her mother's hand!âSweet artifice Of maiden shame, to hide the crimson glow Her ardent speech hath brought upon the cheek That was all lily! (aloud) Go not! [Exit Alice. Mrs. Neville. She is gone To join her youthful comrades. Henry. Ay, she moves Towards them with a gentle dignity, As yonder cygnet glides along the stream. Look! what a picture 'tis to see her pause Under the brow of that lone summer-house Which overhangs the water, overhung With ivy and wild woodbine, backed with firs So old and vast and shadowy, that they lend A blackness to the deep rank grass; and crowned With poplars of such growth, such spiral heightâ The stately columns of eternal Rome Matched not the pair of living monuments That shoot their tapering heads into the sky. She pauses there, the beautiful!âamidst That beauty, lifting her fair hand to shade The light from those blue eyesâshe passes now Beneath the firsâshe disappears. Yon sceneâ Hath she not left a track of brightness there, That living sunbeam?âYon fair scene is made For happiness.âYou sigh. Mrs. Neville. Oh, once it was! Onceâbut that beauty now strikes to my soul A shivering chillnessâOh, it smiles upon me, As the cold moon upon the colder grave. Thou know'st Lord Claremontâthat fair hall once owned Another master. Hast thou never heard The tale of shame and sorrow? Henry. I have heard, Darkly, mysteriously, enough to wake Deep pity. Would'st thouâStranger as I am I dare not askâ Mrs. Neville. Stranger although thou be, There is a pity in thy voice, thine eyes, Thy smile, that looks like comfort: thou art born To listen to sad stories. Didst thou ever Hear of Sir Edward Mortimer? Henry. The grandsire Of this young Lord? the master of yon grand And reverend pile? Often. Mrs. Neville. He was a man Of that free spirit, which doth scatter bliss As winds the summer blossom. In his eye Dwelt mirth, and kindness in his speech, and love In his warm heartâlove of all human kind. Something men spake of wildness in his youth; But when, after long travel, he brought home A lovely lady and two cherub babes, Seemed not a wiser or a better man. Henry. And she? Mrs. Neville. She was a thing of life and light And beauty. Such a vision as erst filled The dreamy soul of Guido, when he drew His bright Aurora. Such a brilliant flush Of health, and joy, and youthâeternal youth! Year after year rolled on, and stole no charm No smile from that fair woman. Strangers saw her Propped on her son's supporting arm, or throwing Her white hand round her daughter's waist, and deemed She was their younger sister. Oh, how proud That noble son was of her peerless grace! With what a sweet and tender flattery He spake, and with what smiling blushes she Would listen! 'Twas a house of love. The daughterâ Henry. Was she not like thy Alice? Mrs. Neville. Ay, as like As two white roses. Thou canst scarce have seen The Lady Claremont? Thou art all too young. Henry. I've seen her portrait, where young purity Is pictured to the life. She sits upon A rock by the sea-shore, her starry eyes Fixed on the gloomy sky, as if to wait The raging of the storm. Mrs. Neville. It came! It came! Poor Mary Mortimer! almost a child, Lord Claremont saw and loved her; she loved him; And they were wedded. After a brief year Of perfect bliss he died, and she returned To the paternal home, with one fair boy, To see her father die. Henry. Alas! alas! Mrs. Neville. Sigh not for them that diedâSigh not for themâ They were the happy. Years had passed away, And grief was gone, another Edward ruled Within the old hereditary hallâ Another kinder, dearerâall built up Of dignity and honour. He had wooed And wedded a young maiden, only rich In love. The gentle countess and her boy Dwelt with them, and his mother with her looks Of beauty, her glad voice, her step of youth. Oh, how the days flew then, when Iâfor I Am that most wretched wife that was most blest! Oh, how the days flew by, whilst Alice clung Around my knee, half jealous when she saw My William at my breast; or tottered round Those giant trees; or on the velvet lawn Rolled in her joy, lisping her half-learnt words To the dear cousin, whose sweet serious eyes Pursued her every motion! kind and frank, And noble boy! I seem to see him now, With his bright face peeping among the boughs Of yonder sweet briar, whilst my fairy girl Sought her dear playmate, and the summer sun Declining, streamed a glory round her form; And I stood watching them almost with tearsâ So the deep gladness stirred meâwhen across Her lovely childish voice, and the gay laugh Of the hidden boy, came quick shrill piercing cries Of sudden woe; and rushing to the house, I saw that beauteous mother on the floor, Pale, speechless, prostrate, writhing; whilst her son With folded arms, and withering eyes, looked on; And her distracted daughter shrieked in gusts Of helpless agony. Why shak'st thou thus? Henry. Man is not made of stone. Be brief. Even now I hear her screaming! Oh, be brief! Mrs. Neville. The boy Had followed me; and trembling with the new Strange sense of misery, seized my husband's hand, And looked up in his face. Then, then he burst From dreadful silence to more dreadful speech, Cursing the mother at his feet, the child Within his hand, the blessed light of day, And life, and love! Darkly the tale of woe Came from him. That fair, panting, crouching thing, Quivering beneath her shame, she had confessed Her frailty. Not till after Edward's birth Did his dead father wed herâhe had been An innocent usurper. At one word We lost our name, our wealth, our very home. Delay had maddened him: before the sun Was set, we and our children had passed forth From this fair heritage, poor wanderers Upon the earth. The gentle heiress staid, Death-struck with the disgrace that seemed to stain Even her white purity. In one short month Her passing-bell had knolled. Henry. PoorâpoorâBut she. The wretchedest, the mother? Mrs. Neville. Ere she rose From off the ground where she had plunged her shame, Her brown hair turned to white. She died not: youth And joy and beauty died; but she lives on In penitence. Henry. And he? Mrs. Neville. Oh what a slow And weary death is grief when it contends With manhood's healthful prime! We wandered on Through many lands. He could not bear the sight Or sound of aught familiarâhis own name Was as a dagger to him; every smile Of his unconscious son a deeper stab: Only my gentle Aliceâher he lovedâ Her only! till at last his heart grew strong As his frame weakened, and he longed once more To see the hallâ'Twas speedy thenâHe lies Under yon yew tree. I have never leftâ I cannot leaveâ Re-enter Alice. Alice. Mother!âDoth she not weep?â Ah me! that tears should sadden such an hour!â Mother! oh, smile upon me! I bring news Of joy.âHe comes to-dayâthis very dayâ It is his birthday. I am come for flowersâ Doth not Lord Claremont love them? Henry. Yes: but most The pure white rose. Alice. Look how it blossoms here Amid the flaunting briarâthe purest rose. We shall soon fill the basket. Mrs. Neville. Claremont comes, The heir, to take his state, to fill the hall With revelry; and Williamâmy poor boy!â Thou art Lord Claremont's friendâcanst thou forgive A mother's tenderness? Henry. Madam, each word Each patient tear of thine drew answering drops From my sad heart. I knew, as Claremont knew, Imperfectly, the story of his race. Oh! it has made the grief of his young life, His splendid orphanage, to bear the weight Of wealth which should be yoursâto feel your woe, To fear your hatred. Alice. Hatred! what, to him? The kindest, noblest, best! Hatred to him! And from my mother! And 'tis thou his friend That talk'st so! Chide him mother. But thou know'st not Thou canst not know, how exquisitely one Claremont and goodness are. We were so poor Till Claremont succoured us; a stripling then, And under a stern guardian's tutelage, He gave up every costly gaud of youth For us. Nay, that were little. He sought out Poor William in his distant school; he wrote To me with such a graciousness; he sent Gifts such as brothers to their sisters sendâ Books, music, flowers: this pretty basketâsee How like a bee-hive the bright straw is wroughtâ This basket came from him. And thou canst talk Of hatred! Henry. Happiest! happiest! Mrs. Neville. She is right; The passing pang is o'er: I cannot grieve To see the noblest of a noble race Even in my husband's seat. Alice. Would he were here! Mother, shall we not know him? I remember, Do I not mother, his dark curling hair, And his mild serious eyes and rosy cheeks, And how I used to love him! Mrs. Neville. Wilt thou tell him All this? Alice. Why should I not? and yet sometimes I have a fluttering at my heartâan aweâ A sinking.âIs it fear?â'Twere wrong to fear Such goodness: yet, in sooth, I tremble, mother; I know not why. If he were gentleâlikeâ If he would take my hand, and only say, Alice! Henry (taking her hand). My cousin Alice! Fly me not, Alice! Alice. Lord Claremont! Henry. Nay, thy Henry, sweet one. It was the first word that thou spakest, Alice; Do not forget it now.âForgive me, Madam, That I thus stole upon ye! Oh, forgive My deeper but unwilling guilt! At length I can be just. The old ancestral hall, The wide demesne, are thine. Within an hour Thy gentle William will be there to fill His father's seatâthe heir. Oh, thank me not: I am still rich in my paternal wealthâ A beggar still in love. I have no motherâ Be thou one to me: let thy William call Me brother. Alice. And poor Alice? Henry. 'Tis through her That I would claim that title. Mrs. Neville. My dear son!</field>
