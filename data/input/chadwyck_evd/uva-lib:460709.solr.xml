      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Street in London. De Morville, De Traci, and Brito, meeting. De Traci. Good morrow, Hugh de Morville!—Richard Brito, Grandson, how great I know not, of the Brut That kill'd his father, and gave life to Britons, (Brutings they should be call'd!),—bon jour, Sir Richard! Brito. I love but little to be jeer'd, Sir Gwillim, By you, or any spring-heel'd Norman knight, About mine ancestors. That Trojan Brutus Was a king's son, and Conqueror of this Isle, No Bastard Conqueror neither!—I have heard Our learned Chancellor tell of it. De Traci. What, Becket? Learned he is in sooth; and gallant too, And wise, as few of his compatriots are. Brito. Gallant as ye! gallant and wise as ye, Half-brethren of the seagulls! whom foul blasts, Loosed from her wallet by some Lapland witch, Blew o'er the Northern foam to France, and thence The next ill wind puff'd hither! De Morville. Down with these swords! Will ye ne'er stop this brawling? Fie! be friends: He's young, Sir Richard; he 's hot-brain'd, De Traci.— Yes, as you said, Becket 's a cunning clerk, Or he would scarce be an Archdeacon; wise As Guiscard's self, or what had made him Chancellor? For boldness, he exceeds all priests; and dares Take even the very Devil by the horns Did he fall out with him. De Traci Well, if he be Falcon in fight, he 's vulture after it! De Morville. He 'll have his pickings! Know you not our adage— The Church's crook When rightly shod, Is a reaping hook On a fishing-rod! De Traci. Yet he 's against the Bishops, in this strife About their jurisdiction; so 'twould seem At least: and echoes our sharp-witted king, Who cries them up as ‘Shepherds skill'd to fleece, Drive, and make market of, those sheep the people.’— Allons, Fitz-Urse! what think you of this man? Enter Fitz-Urse. Fitz-Urse. Whom? De Traci. Why, the man of men—him with more names Than blaze in Doomsday-Book—the Provost of Beverley! De Morville. Dean of Hastings! Brito. Constable of the Tower! De Morville. Secretary of State! Chancellor of the Realm! Archdeacon of Canterbury! Castellan of Cahors! Lord of the baronies of Eye and Berkham! With some few other—scores of trusts and titles, Enough to break Ambition's back withal. He 's a mere sumpter-mule for robes and riches, Save that he trots with them to his own stall, Where sables are his litter, cloth of ermine His housing, and his fodder golden corn. But more: As if the custody of the Royal Seal, With all the perquisites thereto belonging, The administration of all Sees and Abbeys Whilst vacant—which they are whene'er his purse is!— The Wardship of all Minors, whose revenues Leave a rich crust in running through his hands; As if these gifts sufficed not to fulfil His huge capacity for power and office, He is made tutor to the Prince himself, Young Henry, whom the crown o'er-hangs—this Becket! This son of a Saxon truckster, Gilbert Becket, And a bought Moor-woman!—this Jack o'the Beanstalk, That climbs up to the clouds, lark-swift, and there Mocks the mazed world beneath him! Fitz-Urse. Very true. De Morville. This glib Bologna lawyer— Fitz-Urse. True, but yet— De Morville. But what, Fitz-Urse? Fitz-Urse. Thirty-five score pick'd lances He brought us, when much needed at Toulouse: Twelve hundred in the Norman wars. King Harry Owes him some precious jewels of his crown. De Traci. Pardic, but he has claim'd them! If he saved them, 'Twas for himself, to perk in his own cap. Fitz-Urse. He's a stout soldier—that's well: sits his horse Firm as St. Michael sits his Mount; no storm Moves him a hair: Can drive his lance right through A mailed breast, and out between the shoulders; That's pretty well too! Brito. I have seen him strain One of our bows, our mightiest English bows, Till the tough yew bent withy-like; and when it Whirr'd straight again, his shaft was in an oak Barb-deep, twelve-score yards off:—that 's not ill neither! De Traci. He gives brave galas, keeps a Cour d' Amour And Castle-Joyous, throng'd with dames and knights, One blaze of brilliant arms and brighter beauty, Where minstrels warble thick as birds on boughs, And softest instruments thrill through the halls, And murmurs sweet make up the swarming sound, And merry bells ring aye a gaudeamus! This holy Chancellor hawks, hunts, jousts, drinks, Games, and etceteras—'slife, a noble fellow! De Morville (aside). Our youth's brain is all feathers, so his thoughts Are of the flightiest— Fitz-Urse. As for me, gentlemen, While Becket aids the king, with sword or pen, With head in helm or cowl, I am content To like him. De Traci. Bah! so am I. Brito. And I. De Morville. Then I. Enter a Beggerman. Beggarman. Your charity, brave gentlemen! De Traci. If a pennon were as tattered as this fellow's cloak, 'twould be called the more honourable, and perchance hung up in a chapel.—Here 's money for thee—go! De Morville. 'Tis so small a piece of brass, that it shines in the abyss of his hat, like a glow-worm in a dark ditch. Here 's another munificent speek—go! we are but poor Knights of the King's Body. Beggarman. Bless ye, but I am poverty itself! De Traci. Thou? thou art a Knight of the Hospital, no less, as I see by thy crutch and bandages. Get thee away, Sir Lazarus! here comes the king. Brito. Heaven smiles in his blue eye, and from his brow The sun himself shines out! De Morville. Becket is with him. They seem right jocund. How they laugh! as boys, With their ripe-apple cheeks. Brito. The Chancellor 's a wit, And our good Harry loves it, seasoning wisdom, As an abbot loves a pot of ale with spice in't.— Get thee along, fellow! Beggarman (going behind the knights). I'll steal, if nothing else, a look at him. What 's a king like? Good lack, I suppose St. George-and-the-Dragon. He has two bodies, that 's sure! Enter Henry and Becket, the King with his hands on Becket's shoulders. Henry. Ha! ha! ha! ha! By Mahound, an excellent tale! Come, let us have the other! Press thee a little; Thou overflow'st with humour, like the gourd With richest juice.—Come, shall we hear it, ha? Becket. May 't please you, sire, now that the evening sun Reflects him somewhat redly in our looks, Which he perchance,—so tinged are they with wassail,— Mistakes for clustering grape, whereon he loves To hang with warmest kisses— Henry. Let him kiss! And send his burning soul into our cheeks, Till he change back our blood again to wine, That fed it! An old Wassailer himself! That swills the nectarous ether till he reels. Look you, he wears an after-dinner flush Crimson as ours! Rogue, he has had his drench, And purple streams run down his fleecy skirts, Staining them deep as thine!—Ha? what, Fitz-Urse? What news from Canterbury? Fitz-Urse. My liege, his Grace The archbishop gasps so hard for life, he scarce Had breath to make fit answer to your Highness. Henry. Poor man! Heaven's gates stand aye ajar for him: He has a very Saint been ere he died: A meek, good man!—What mightiness in mildness! I 've never gain'd from his soft nature half I had wrung from a stern one.—But he gave some proof That he agreed the felon-priest should stand Trial in our Courts, not his? Fitz-Urse. Ay, my liege: Here is the instrument his death-stricken hand Marked with the cross. [Giving a parchment. Henry. So! well. Keep it, Chancellor, [Handing it to him. Till further time.—Have with you to your palace, And we will hear that story by the way, You promised us. [Becket stands abstracted. Prithee what mood and figure Is this deep syllogism thou 'rt solving now? He 's sunk within himself!—Ho, Chancellor! Becket. (starts). I was but conning o'er the tale—my memory— Henry. Since you can fold you in your loose fur-sleeves, And in the sable pall of thought besides, You want not this warm gown? Becket. I would in truth Put it off—soon—with your good leave— Henry. See'st there [Pointing to the Beggarman. Yon shiverer, in rags as few as hang Upon the roadside thorn?—Were it not well To give that wretch, who shakes i' the summer's sun Like Winter's image, something of your too-much For his too-little? Becket. I am all content, And will provide him quickly. Henry. Thou wert ever Most charitable, Thomas!—Come, strip off This superfluity. [Laying hold of his robe. Becket. Nay, nay, your Highness. [Struggling to keep it. Henry. I swear I'll have it!—You shall walk the town Naked as dame Godiva, and more stared at, But I will have it! [They struggle. Knights. Ha! ha! ha!—the King will carry it!—the Chancellor doubles it close!—'Tis a stiff tussle!—Lion against Bear! De Morville. No; but shepherd against wolf in sheep's clothing! 'Twill be rent between them!— Becket. It is the maddest humour!—[He lets the cloak go. Henry. Tut, man! thou need'st but bury thee again In Meditation's solemn robe: it much Becomes so grave a lord!—Ha! ha!—I never Saw thee so lost in foggy thought before. 'Twas a rich mantle, but thou wilt be cover'd With blessings far more precious.—Give it him! [It is flung to the Beggar. Beggarman. Heaven guard your Majesty, and send my Lord All that he wishes! And for his good-will In leaving me this benefit, may he live A glory to the Church, and at his death Be worshipt 'mongst the blessed saints and martyrs! No worse I pray for him— Becket. Enough, enough! [Exit Beggar. Henry. Ha! ha! ha! ha! Thou 'rt well repaid for thy benevolence!— Fitz-Urse, I say?—Again to Canterbury: Stay by the Primate; let no buzzing monks (Save his confessor, Gryme, whom we can trust,) Haunt his bedside; nor, while he drops to slumber On the eternal pillow of repose, With pestilent whispers sting him in the ear. He 's not to change the instrument—mark that!— He has given o'er the priest to the King's Bench, Lawful tribunal for such crime.—And Reginald! If the Archbishop hold his promise well, Give his meek spirit my god-speed, and send me Immediate tidings when he is in heaven.—[Exit Fitz-Urse. Have with you, Chancellor. Becket. At your Grace's pleasure. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE II. A Royal Apartment.—Queen Eleanor alone. Eleanor. Henry, thou play'st me false! With whom, I know not, But to find that out, feel myself all eyes: Each sense, except my sight, is numb, null! null! I do not taste my meats; I hear no music Even when the trumpet brays it at my side; To me the rose is scentless as the briar; What touches me might be a burning share, Or wedge of ice, they are indifferent: But I can see! see—atomies! Thou shalt not, Minion, escape me! 'Mongst ten thousand faces Were thine one, I could swear to its bold blush. O! I could guess her from a gown, a glove, A cap, or aught her wanton form had ever Swell'd out!—Suspicion, thou art call'd the dam Of false conceits, to which the Devil is sire; To me thou seem'st somewhat almost divine, That canst discern all things at once—a searcher Into the murkiest heart! Come, Inspiration Of the abused; suggest the shape, the air, The vision of my rival, and my victim!— Let me consider:— I should know something of the stratagems Play'd off by tricksy woman; all the webs She weaves before men's eyes to hide herself; The painted bashfulness she can put on, To seem what she is not; the brazen front She steps so high with, to be thought impregnable As Pallas, when as slippery as Venus: All these, ere my divorce from that nice fool, Louis of France, punctilious Louis! I Had perfect-making practice in; and if I have the pain of such repute, I 'll have The gain, please Vengeance!—Oh, she must find out Some holier sanctuary than the sepulchre, Even for her dead bones, that I shall not gibbet them As high as Haman's, to the grinning world!— My Maidens there?— [Enter the Maids of Honour. If ye be such?—Now, Bold-face! Are you the King's—toy? First Maid. Madam, my humbleness never Reach'd the majestic level of his eyes. Eleanor. Nor you, stale Prudery? Second Maid. Madam, not I! Eleanor. You'll all say so! you'll all say so! when even The infamous brand had burnt plain Harlot there On the convenient tablet of your brows.— Get ye all gone!—Come back, and dress me quick— (To herself.) I will go talk with that same cunning man At Clerkenwell, who kens all covert doings Which Night's dark mantle wraps.—(Aloud) Is there, or no, A haunt of wise-folk near the brambled fields By Old-Bourne hill? Third Maid. Great madam, ay. Eleanor. Had ye not, one of ye, your fortune told, Even to the pettiest freak? Third Maid. Your Grace, they told me: “You are to serve a Queen, and gain one day A pair of royal ear-rings for your pay.” Eleanor. Darling of Destiny! they said you sooth,— [Pinches her ears. I 'll see if they tell me such punctual truth.— Hie to your chambers!—Dwerga! [The Dwarf peeps forth. Make the bolt Upon these gadders, and these gossip-goers, As wandering and as wanton as the vines That must be nail'd up.— [Exeunt Maids. I will now to Becket's, But in another hood. Ho there, Abortion! Enter Dwerga. Dwerga. Here! here, my grandam! Eleanor. Thine, prodigious Imp? Dwerga. What, am I not thy grand-child? thou that bought'st me Of my Norse dam, when scarce the size of a crab, And fed'st me to my present stature with Dainties of all kinds—cocks' eggs, and young frogs So freshly caught they whistled as they singed, Like moist wood, on the spit, still bubbling out Dew from their liquid ribs, to baste themselves, As they turn'd slowly!—then rich snails that slip My throttle down ere I well savour them; Most luscious mummy; bat's-milk cheese; at times The sweetbreads of fall'n mooncalves, or the jellies Scumm'd after shipwreck floating to the shore: Have I not eat live mandrakes, screaming torn From their warm churchyard-bed, out of thy hand? With other roots and fruits cull'd ere their season,— The yew's green berries, nightshade's livid bugles, That poison human chits but nourish me,— False mushrooms, toadstools, oak-warts, hemlock chopt? Eleanor. Ay, thou 'rt an epicure in such luxuries. Dwerga. My fangs still water!—Grandam, thou art good! Dost thou not give me daily for my draught Pure sloe-juice, bitter-sweet! or wormwood wine, Syrup of galls, old coffin-snags boil'd down Thrice in fat charnel-ooze, so strong and hilarous, I dance to a tub's sound like the charmer's snake We at Aleppo saw? What made me, pray you, All that I am, but this fine food? Thou art, Then, my creatress; and I am thy creature. Eleanor. My creature, not my offspring. Dwerga. Oh, thou thought'st I meant thy very babe—by the young Saracen Of my swart favour, whom thou loved'st in Jewry— Eleanor. Small monster! I will crush thee like a hornet If thou darest buzz a word of that— Dwerga. Sweet grandam! I would not for the world, save here alone That we may chuckle at thy husband's honours! Eleanor. Fetch me my hood,— The yellow one. Dwerga. Yes, grandam! (Sings) As the browns are for the clowns, And the blacks are for the quacks, So the scarlets for the harlots, And the yellows for the jealous! [Exit. Eleanor. Venomous spider! I could pierce it through With a witch's bodkin, but it does me service. Dwerga (re-entering behind her). Doats on thee too, dear grandam!—less in gratitude Than that, as Dwerga does and all her race, Thou work'st ill to those gawkish, smooth, soft things, Call'd mortals.—Shan't I go with thee, my Dame? Eleanor. Thou wouldst be mischievous. Dwerga. Lovest thou not mischief? No!—hatest it, worse than the horse-leech hates blood! Eleanor. In, cockatrice!—that wouldst sting even the hand Which feeds thee, and caresses!—In, deformity! Dwerga. Must I sit purring like a tigress-cub Over my paws alone? or peer from out These bars, like a new-caught baboon? Eleanor. Attend Thy duty; or I'll pack thee to the chymist, Who 'll drown thee first in vitriol, and then Bottle thee up as a false birth of Nature, To draw the passing gaze with. 'Tend thy duty! Thou 'lt have enough to keep those skittish fillies From whinnying out of bounds, if they should hear Even a jackass bray. Dwerga. I 'll fetter them! They are as fearful of me as a fiend. If they dare venture forth, I 'll spit green fire, Pinch them about the ancles, fly upon them As a wild cat, and score their waxen cheeks, Distract them with such dissonant yells and screams That they shall think ten furies flicker round them! Break out?—Let one o' them,—with my spongy lips I'll suck a blood-spot on her neck will spoil Her beauty for a month! Not the Nile weasel Falls with such malice on the crocodile's eggs, As I will on these glossy ones! Eleanor. Do so!—yet take Some heed,—for mortals have their malice too. Dwerga. Ha! ha! ha! ha! They cannot hurt me, as my skin is thick And bags about me all in dewlaps—see! Then I can roll me up into a hedgehog, And put out prickles that would pierce their feet, Did they tramp on me; I can slip away Like a sleek otter when they grasp at me, And then turn short and bite till my teeth meet. Let me alone for them! Eleanor. In, then, and watch.— [Exit Dwerga. The Chancellor holds a feast: there my false Harry Will be, no doubt, by preconcert, to meet His bella donna. None thinks of Eleanor! Her bloom is flown, as are the amorous bees That once clung to it!—I am left forsooth With a few manikins and greensick girls, To lead an old-maid's after-life with apes In this hell-gloomy palace!—But I'll follow! I 'll be a guest they neither wot nor wish! I 'll be a go-between,—to part, not couple!— Are they assembled yet?—Some half-hour gone!— 'Tis time!—Ha! ay!—he bows her to the dance. They smile—they lisp—they make dove's eyes—they murmur. He leads her now to a dim, curtain 'd room— They rush to the love-wrestle—kiss—they kiss!— O serpents in my heart!—methinks my flesh Turns to a swarm of them! I feel my hair Tangle and writhe and swell like sinewy creatures! I 'm Fury's self,—all but her scourge!—Oh, lend it, Vengeance!—this hand with palsy of eagerness shakes To use it on these kissers!—Kiss? hiss! kiss! My blood turns poison at the sound!—Kiss! hiss! [Exit. SCENE III. Apartments in Becket's Palace, gorgeously set out and illuminated. Knights, Ladies, Squires, Pages, Minstrels, Attendants: the former attired or disguised in different quaint or characteristic dresses. Cates and wines served round. Music. The King seen apparelled as a Soldan in an inner chamber. Becket enters, and signs to De Morville. Becket. De Morville, you love not these mummeries, Whilst, as all other wise men, you allow them. Hie to the porch, good sir; you know the Queen; Should Jealousy, that ignis fatuus, With green and flickering taper light her hither,— Though she pretends in sourness of her soul To love retreat, and feasts but on her spleen (Which sprouts the more she crops it—crude refection, That makes her meagrer still!); and though she is Too proud for mirth's equality;—yet should she Perchance come— De Morville. I am to give notice.—[Aside] Hang him! I scorn these gauds no more than Eleanor, Though I scoff at them too. Becket. Brito is there, But—“Two heads,” says the proverb. If she come, Delay her with some shows of reverence, Whilst you send word. There 's reason high—look to 't. [Passes on. De Morville. I'll fill Sir Richard like a leathern jack Up to the lips with Winton wine; and then You shall have Roland for your Oliver! [Exit. [Several personages move through the rooms; among them a Veiled Lady, followed by a Gentleman-Usher. After they go out, re-enter Becket. Becket. Another guest I've mark'd within the halls, Unbidden as the Queen,—at least by me! When I besought her name, that frowning Usher With courtesy more haught than baron's, said Between his teeth,—Demoiselle Disconnue. Whom she may be indeed, I but surmise, For still she flits and flits, fair Spectre, gliding Speechless along, nor mixing with us mortals, More than the pale Moon with the enamour'd trees Through which she glances, coldly beaming on them.— Much time is in the minute. This bright thing, Like some rich gem, is for a monarch's hand, I guess, not being unskilful in such jewelry: Let me do him—and some one else—a service, By keeping it from the Gryphon; Eleanor Must not lay clutch on it, lest she perhaps, Like the Egyptian drunkardess, dissolve it In some sharp menstruum—yea, so devour it, Through luxury of revenge!— Good king, thou 'lt thank me better for this deed, And faster bind me friend, than had I saved Rouen or Caen! Our private services seem Love to the king, public but to the kingdom. Harry of England! Albeit thou hast much wisdom, for one born But to be made a fool of from the cradle,— Yet so predominates the weaker element Of that same earth-and-water compost—Man— That even the fiery spirit heaven put to it Cannot drink up the spring of softness in thee, But leaves thee mouldable by skilful hands— What 's this? I am forgotten! Most by myself, and worst— [Turning to the guests. Drink, gentlemen! Ye trifle with me only!—Fill me there [To a Page. A horn of hippocras, so amber-pure The yellow lights shall flame more lustrous through it! Brim it up, boy! till the fresh dazzling foam Swell o'er its burnish'd lip, like these fair bosoms Above their bordering gold!—Health, beauteous Dames! Sweet Demoiselles! health, noble Chevaliers! Pledge me, I pray you, all!—my wishes are So personal for the health of each, they ask Unanimous return! Guests. Be happy, sir, As you deserve; we need not wish you more! Becket. Thanks! thanks!—Now let the flood of joy roll on And bear us with it,—so we keep our feet! Now let the perfumed air with pleasure glow Till even the hard heart melt, the iciest burn! Now, gallants, lead your mistresses a measure Where they can prove the Graces are not fled With classic times!—Come, ladies!—Sooth I'll swear You've not fine ancles if you fear to show 'em!— Minstrels, strike up! let the gay mandolin Mock the grave-voiced theorbo; whilst the harp With intricacy sweet of various chimes, Bewilders its own strain; and fife and shalm, Piercing the tabret's solid-booming hum, Give a clear edge to music!—Trouveurs! Conteurs! Spread, spread about your free wits and yourselves! Hie to the bow'red chamber and alcove Whither Love's chief luxuriasts retire, And in the ear of bending beauty pour Your amorous songs, and tell soul-moving tales, Or mirthful, to such triumph of your skill, That these vast domes re-murmur with sweet sighs Or throb with echoing laughter. Make all pleased To be here, as I am to see them! [Passes on. 1st Lady. A gallant man, our Host! the cream of courtesy! 2d Lady. Oh a magnificent creature!—such a leg!— 1st Cavalier. He is the prince of priests! An Alderman. Ay, and a learned, I 'll assure you: he has read Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Lives of the Saints —in Latin; besides being deep in Romance as not a minstrel of them all! An Abbot. O sir, his accomplishment has gone much farther than your imagination: Venerable Bede himself, who read so much he did not know the extent of his own knowledge, was an ignoramus to our Chancellor. 2d Cavalier. Truly it is possible: what with his embassies to Rome, and his studious sojourn among the Italians, he must have their Latin talk as much at his tongue's end as a nun's parrot has the vocabulary of scandal. Abbot. It must be so, for never unfledged wit Could take such flight as his, so near the sun! 2d Lady. He has learned somewhat better than your learning, I'm sure! What is it all to La gaie Science? In that he is perfect! 3d Cavalier. Well, I forgive him being able to read and write, which is only fit for those slugs of the cloister-garden, the monks, but the disgrace of a preux chevalier; I forgive it him all, because he can sing the Song of Roland better than any man since—what-d'ye-call-him? that led us on at Hastings. Abbot. You speak of Taillefer, the warrior-minstrel— Enter Brito behind, intoxicated, with a leathern jack. 3d Cavalier. Taillefer, or Tell-fair, either will do—he told us fair enough we should be conquerors. 4th Cavalier. This Becket is a Saxon—where did he get so much fire of genius to clarify his fatness of brain derived from such ancestors? What are the Saxons fit for, but to swill, sleep, and tend swine? Brito. That's a libel, by St. Edward the Confessor!— I confess it a most nefarious libel, and will prove it so on this spot! 4th Cavalier. You lie there as you stand, and shalt lie again where you fall! [Draws. Brito. Come on with your bull-rush, you perpendicular French frog!—Here's my battle-axe! [Swinging the jack. An Esquire. Oh, he is drunk, he 's drunk!—tongue and all totter! [Supporting Brito. Brito. You're drunk yourself! You've drunk so much, everything dances before you, and so you think I totter!— Tend swine, indeed? Saxons only fit to tend swine? You, Norman squire jackanapes! you're only fit to tend me,— and that's not much better! Guests. Ha! ha! ha! ha!—truth is in wine! Brito. I heard what ye said, backbiters—swine forsooth only fit to tend Saxons!—Oh, I shall never forget it!—Was not Harry Beauclerc (bless his scholarship!) half Saxon at the least? 4th Cavalier. Norman, to the backbone of his heart!— how prove you him half Saxon? Brito. Ay, and more! Wasn't his wife, Maud Atheling, Saxon,—and what call you that but his better half? Pish! it is child's-play to put you addle-headed Normans down! Was Alfred the Great Saxon or no? tell me that. And was he only fit for a hog-herd, a tender of bristled sheep? Did Alfred lack genius or learning? Didn't he translate the Pater Noster into English, which every good Saxon, who doesn't carry his prayers in his cheek, has by heart? —Didn't he cudgel those sea-robbers the Danes (birds of the same nest with the Normans, I trow!) till he hammered the laws of propriety into their loggerheads? 4th Cavalier. Cudgel the Normans?—(Drawing.) Brito. Ay, Normans or Lord-Danes, 'twas all one! [They fight. Guests. Part them! Peace, peace; here comes our Entertainer! Becket (re-entering). What is the matter? Revelry is not riot!— How now, Sir Richard! wherefore thus come up From the guard-chamber? Brito. Come up? marry come up!—I'm come up because I was elevated! Becket. Who put this porker into such a pickle? Brito. Why, good Sir Hugh, none else! Sir Hugh was my pickler, and preserver likewise—with drink— or I had perished of a dry rot in your guard-cellar below! —He thought to keep me from mounting, the knave! but I roared beyond all forbearance. Becket. De Morville? ha! I smell a viper.— (To the Attendants). Look, This swollen wine-skin tumble not about— [Exit. Brito. Now a tankard of brown ale to damp my lips with, and a song, when my throat is cleared for a chaste melody— [Singing as he is led off. Then a catch we 'll troll, While the beechen bowl Trundles along the table—O! And we 'll drink and sing Like a priest or a king, As long as we are able—O! Scene changes to another Room, embowered, and opening on an Orchard. Henry (as Soldan), La Disconnue, and her Gentleman-Usher. Henry. Shine forth, fair Moon! I prithee, from beneath The cloud which floats between me and thy beams, To bless me with the soft blaze of thy beauty! I am an eagle of the night, that dares Fix on the glorious Sister of the Sun His ardent eye, which broadens as she brightens, To take in more of her loved radiancy With which his rapt soul kindles!—Oh, at length Put off that shroud; unless thou 'lt have me think Death hath o'er-marbled thee, so cold thou seem'st, So mute, so still! La Disconnue. Alas! I am yet living!— But we are now alone, and shelter'd here: Yet here, in secret and heart-quivering sounds, I must speak only to thee, as a bird That warns her mate the fowler is too nigh. Thou know'st whose will it is has brought me hither To-night, unto this Castle Dangerous, No Joyous one to me! Henry. Fair Rose of England! My flower! my bosom's sweet!—look not, I pray, With such a sadness and lost pensiveness Upon this secret venture for my sake, Thy harmless presence here: nor ever deem Love's blossomy ways are so bestrewn with thorns To pierce all tenderest things. La Disconnue. Ay, to the heart! Henry. Nay, nay, not thine! They shall not: trust thy puissant king and knight! La Disconnue. Well! well! Henry. I wish'd thee here, it is so rare for us And difficult to meet; what with the jealousy Of my gaunt Queen, and thy self-chariness, Which ne'er confides thy honour unto mine, [Nodding at her Attendant. Sans surveillance, for all my promises, My book-sworn faith and heaven-register'd vows. La Disconnue. Ay me! Henry. Thou murmuring dove!—fear not; shalt soon, And safe, betake thee to thine own dim bower. Meantime thou 'rt here but La Belle Disconnue! Unknown and unsuspected. La Disconnue. Let me still To all here seem a vision, save to thee. Henry. Nay, by Love's shaft! thou art no substance yet Even to me!—I have not touch'd thy hand— [Taking her hand. Most delicate thing! let mine eyes drink thy lustre! Can o'er-and-o'er refined earth become Indeed so dazzling-pure? I could scarce guess thee From lightest leaf freighted with new-fall'n snow Which the chill evening sun tinges so faint, Save that thou throbb'st (as thou wert all one pulse) Though laid in my soft clasp!—Sweet, tremble not! England himself's thy champion!—Once to my lips— Once, and no more!— Kisses her hand. Dian, who gazes on us, Might consecrate this sin! La Disconnue. O no! methinks Yon moving shrine of purity doth shudder— It sheds bright tears—grows dim—We have offended! Let me depart. Henry. Wilt thou be yet so coy And credulous of ill?—Take this as seal [Shows a Ring. Of my drawn bond to thee: canst thou have more? When Eleanor of Guienne makes one among The carved saints and sovereigns in our Abbey, (Which she is wrinkled grim enough to be!) Thou art my Queen!—By all above I swear it, And all beneath!—Is this enough, suspectful? La Disconnue. Hear'st thou, Lord Walter? Gentleman-Usher. I am satisfied! Becket (passing swift behind, mutters) —The Queen! the Queen! Henry. Now wish I from my soul Louis had kept her or the Devil ta'en her! [Exeunt different ways: the Ring drops in the confusion. Enter Queen Eleanor. Eleanor. Plantagenet, by his port—Vain guise! I know Well, the crown-bearing air of that proud head, And fitful clenching of that hand, as if It aye grasp'd at a sword!—I can see all!— Were no companions here? Methought I heard The rustling harsh of gauzes, and light step Of silver-slipper'd woman, fleeting away!— They've barred my passage, but I 'll break one— [Turning towards the Verandah. Vengeance! I pray'd thee for a vision of my rival, And there it is—vanish'd into the night! Curses on both!— [Seeing the Ring. What's this? thou basilisk, That kill'st me with thy fatal glare! cold glitterer, Which, like the jewel that the bright-eyed toad Voids from his head, poison'st e'en by thy touch,— How I abhor—nay, love thee!— [Snatching it up. Thou that show'st The wrong, wilt haply cast some little ray On the wrong-doer. One gleam, where'er so deep She hides her this side hell, will strike her guilt Aghast,—as to all workers in dark ways, One sunbeam is a thunderbolt!—Good night, Thou whom they blazon—La Belle Disconnue, For ignorance is idolatrous. We yet May know each other; till then, rest ye well! [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The King's Closet. Henry and Fitz-Urse. Henry. Old Theobald is dead: well, Heaven send him More peace than he gave us from fractious monks, Our mild Archbishop! Fitz-Urse. He's not stiffer now In body than he ever was in spirit. Henry. By Mahound thou say'st true, rugged-mouth'd Reginald! Your lawn-lapt bishop is less flexible Than baron stark in steel. The Christian Pharisees! Fitz-Urse. Dog's death to them, and ass's burial Outside the gates! Henry. We'll crush them, Reginald! We 'll crush the stiff-necked shavelings now, if any Iron be in this arm!—Go you and haste The Council—let me see—to the Red Chamber: They've had a summons; haste them! [Exit Fitz-Urse. He shall be Primate. Not that his learning, wisdom, and state-craft, So much commend him to the office; nor That courage of the head, which few men have (Heart-courage is beast-common!) to dare look Beyond this petty wave of time, and scan Futurity's spreading deep; nor yet in sooth His life, which, I confess, like mine, gives forth Some odour of unsanctity:—but that He is my friend, who loves his self for me; Whom I can trust with all my thoughts as freely As the two-headed God could let his flow From one brain to its neighbour. For these matters Touching the Church, wherefore should he oppose me, Now, after long agreement? He has oft Said Amen to our secular anathema, Against encroachers on our civil rights. No, I could ne'er select a fitter tool! He ever to my will has been obsequious, To my least wishes, even when his hatred. He help'd me to the crown too!—Though he have Small influence, as a losel, with his order, So best; he 'll have less interest for them too! With a rough besom I must sweep this Church, For it is foul; albeit at the same time, I scratch some reverend bare legs within it. 'Tis a bold move; and may e'en shake the kingdom Till the throne totter; but it must be made! No blenching, Harry! Deeds become great by danger: Upon Destruction's hair-broad margin still Success doth love to walk!—Let's to the work: 'Twill halve itself upon me and my choice, So become light to the joint labourers. He shall be Primate! [Exit SCENE II. A Conjurer's Cell. Apparatus for magic. Eleanor disguised, and the Conjurer. Eleanor. Make me to see her who doth own this ring In what so cloudy and disfigurate form You will,—but make me see her. Conjurer. Give me the jewel First: there is nothing can be done without The jewel. Eleanor. There!—Shew me her in the arms Of Satan's self, burning in his embraces, If possible, good Wizard! Conjurer. Madam, whoe'er You boast yourself, your accents are more terrible Than those I conjure with! They scare my wits, And make me use wrong mixtures. Yea, they seem To scare the very demon I would summon, Mine own familiar! Eleanor. Cite him again! It is My heart-wrung groans to Vengeance make me hoarse, Tearing my gorge:—cite him again, I say! Conjurer. Then keep you silence!—(Aside) The shebandog's throat Is furr'd and dry, she breathes so hot for blood! Such horrible and hollow, hell-drawn sounds, Ne'er came from sepulchre unconsecrate, At whose dark bottom moan the tortured dead. Bless me from this grim harridan! Eleanor. Thou caitiff! What keep'st thou muttering there thy husky charms? Shriek out thy incantations and commands Till the deaf adders of the pit shall hear thee! Conjurer. She's more a domineerer over demons, Than I!—Is't Hecate's self?—Madam, perchance My black-bird would come to your chirrup rather? (Aside.) So wrapt she is in fardingales, I cannot See by her foot if she's the Devil's dam, But truly I do think it!—Let me stand Safe in my circle— [Gets within his circle of gallipots. Eleanor. Slaverer! idiot! Mumbling thy mummeries, and dropping drivel Into thy row of potsherds, raise me a fume Blood red and black as the two elements That make hell's atmosphere,—where I may see Some Power of Darkness, who shall give me light, Volume himself abroad! Conjurer. I will! I will!—(Aside.) Fulgor ex fumo is beyond my art, However I must raise a good thick smoke To smother her, if but to stop her noise.— (Muttering.) Caballo! caballavi! caballero! Mescoskylaxinax! I conjure thee By the rains and the winds and the thunder, In the name of the stars of power Algoth and Algol and Aldebaràn, Through the decocted virtue of these herbs, Devil's-bit, dragon's-wort, death's-foot, Per medium et mixtram mineralion, Quantum et qualium sufficit, Mescoskylaxinax! I conjure thee, Arise! arise! arise! [A volume of lurid smoke rises: in the midst a fiendlike shape appears. Conjurer. Who art thou, villain!—Mark with what respect He'll take my greeting— A Voice. Thy familiar spirit! Full of thy nature! thy swart other self! Therefore most truly—villanous! [Dwerga comes forth, the fiend-shape flies. Conjurer. Mercy!—I never Raised such a real devil before!—Avaunt! [Quits his circle, and runs behind the Queen. Dwerga (getting into the circle). Hu! hu! hex! hex! Now I'll be conjurer! First let me lay this gibbering, ghost-like form In a Red-Sea—of ruddle!— [Dashing a gallipot at him. There's pot-luck for thee! (Dashing another.) There's a hot cordial to keep life in thee, Thou bloodless wretch! that even at thy birth Wert a half dead-born thing!—Mistress, I 'll spit him On his own rod, and roast the tame goose here With his pale liver stuck beneath his arm-pit— Eleanor. Forbear!— Dwerga. I 'll do him a nice delicate brown Upon the sulphur, a tit-bit for Baal! Eleanor. Bring not the people in with this strange hurley— [Exit Conjurer. Dwerga. Hu! hu! hex! hex!—He could not charm an owl Out of an ivy-tod to play the wiseacre, Or screech wild oracles!—I have more craft In this hard, knotted skull, than deep-read dunce Ere drew from his dry parchments!—His familiar? Ay!—she has been—for 'twas a female spirit Gross as a male—familiar enow with him! Six white-faced imps, as like to both of them As tadpoles are to toads, squat by the fire Under that trap-door, whence your fine diabolus Rose vapouring in rank perfume, from a pile Of pitchwood; o'er whose blaze in cauldron huge Welter'd their soup of cabbage. I'd have scratch'd Those pap-soft faces while within my claw, But fear'd to make them squall. Eleanor. How got you there? Dwerga. From outside, where you left me snivelling. Worse than a beggar's brat, with cold, I scamper'd On all fours, like a black cat, in the dusk, Down their blind stairs, into their reeky kitchen, When you stept up aloft: there sat I squinting Out of a rat's nest, and saw all. Eleanor. And am I The dupe of such poor tricksters, then? Dwerga. No, grandam; Of thy own folly rather!—But take comfort: It is not the first wife has play'd the devil In her own house— [Clutching up the Ring. Ho! ho! a prize! a prize! Eleanor. Reptile! render me that.— Dwerga. Not till I've lick'd it [Scrambling to the roof. Clean from the colley, and decypher'd it. I'm out o' thy reach among the rafters. Nay, Whirl aught at me, I 'll tear a hole in the roof, And blazon shrill as the crack'd trumpet blows,— The Queen of England in a Conjurer's garret! Thou wert best let me alone. I'll suck the virtue Out of this talisman, and spirt it down Upon you, grandam! Eleanor. Thou art all lie! a warp Of subtleties! all malice, mockery! As treacherous and unreliable As the parch'd reed is to a drowning man! I cannot trust one word thou say'st, except it Condemn thyself. Dwerga. Or thee, thou mayst trust that too!— But hey?—What 's here?—A Rose within a Snake [Examining the device. Coil'd huge about her: good!—in a love-symbol, The serpent aye should couch him by the rose! What's this again that twists the flower around, Strangling her, as the ivy doth the elm In his lithe arms? A feather'd sprig, with blossom Shaped like a cockle-fish or butterfly: Why there's your secret! Eleanor. Where? tell me! I'll give thee Comfits made from the whites of deadmen's eyes!— Dwerga. Pish on thy comfits and thy deadmen's eyes! Let me torment these lovers for thy meed. Eleanor. What lovers? who? Dwerga. The Broom-sprig and the Rose, Thou silly Queen!—Malice and silliness Make up earth's meanest creature!—Who is now The sprig that bears the cockled-butterfly, But thy Plantagenet—planta-genista? Eleanor. And who the rose? Dwerga. That 's more a riddle to me.— Sweat brain!—Perchance some trull whose name is Rose, Or Rosalind, or—stop! it lightens on me!— This undulous snake cut here, great Jormungandr— As Runic rhymesters call him—doth set forth Ocean, that ever on his belly rolling, Coils round the convex world; which world the rim Doth therefore stand for: whence the Rose itself In our quaint stone-cutter's device but means, Rose of the World,—that is, plain Rosa-Mundi; Plantagenet and Rosamond are the lovers! Eleanor. But there may be many Rosamonds in the realm? Dwerga. Seek the most fair: that's she. Plantagenet hath A hawk's eye for sweet duckling, though he stopp'd His maw with fishy thee. Eleanor. Would I could do Without thy hateful service! Dwerga. Thou canst not: A weak and wicked mind must ever have A cunning, evil-loving minister To work its ends; must be the jest at once, Hatred and scorn and tool of its own slave. I 've a rare merit for a minister,— Sincerity! What think ye, grandam?—Go you Now to the wise-folk to collogue with them Who Rosamond, the fair unknown, may be? Eleanor. I must gulp this, Howe'er so bitter; but the long, large draught Of honey-sweet revenge will drown it all! [Exit. Dwerga. Go on, good grandam! I'll stick in thy skirts, Like a live burr; Fear not! Hu! hu! hex! hex! [Sings as she follows. Speckle-black Toad and freckle-green Frog, Hopping together from quag to bog; From pool into puddle Right on they huddle; Through thick and through thin, Without tail or fin; Croakle goes first and Quackle goes after, Plash in the flood And plump in the mud, With slippery heels Vaulting over the eels, And mouths to their middles split down with laughter! Hu! hu! hex! SCENE III. A State Chamber. The Council assembled. Cornwall, Clare, Leicester, Becket, De Bohun, De Lucy, Grand Prior, Winchester. Cornwall. Well met, my lords: what makes us here so soon after cock-crow? Clare. I can tell as little as Sir Chanticleer himself;— perhaps his Highness's conscience-keeper has the secret? Leicester. Ay, Chancellor, how judge you? Becket. What I, gentlemen? In good truth my knowledge on the matter does not exceed your own, nor is my judgment any deeper than yours,—(Aside) and that is very shallow; my guesses may pierce a little farther indeed! De Lucy. Silence; here 's the King! Enter Henry. Henry. Fair morning.—Ha? when comes the trial on Before our bench, of that law-breaking priest? Becket. To-morrow, Sire, I hope. Winchester. It cannot be. Henry. It cannot, bishop? wherefore? Winchester. Sire, I fear There may be obstacles. Henry. Pshaw!—cliffs and gulfs Are obstacles to grasshoppers, not eagles.— Archbishop Theobald is dead, my lords: Whom shall we give the regular chapter leave To elect? Who shall be Primate, cousin Clare? Clare. What thinks your Highness of the Abbot Blaise? Henry. Too old! too old!—I've had enough of greybeards! Age renders obstinate, and knots and gnarls The bent of our green-grown opinions. I Still less than conjugal, love stale episcopal Petticoat government!—Your man, Grand Prior? Grand Prior. My Lord of Winton here, though like an oak Hoary at top, has sap enough; and fame Of wisdom for a kingdom. Henry. He has too little Even for himself, or else he had not cross'd me.— O Prior, 'twere too rough and wearisome An office for my lord; too full of ‘obstacles;’ I would not throw them in the velvet path His wisdom rightly chooses to the grave.—You, Constable? De Bohun. I'm no thinker. Henry. What say you, Chancellor? Becket. My gracious liege, I have no choice but yours: That will, as ever it is, be most discriminate, Profoundest, wisest; all-advantageous, For him, the kingdom, and your royal self. Henry. So think I!—Gentlemen, salute his grace Thomas à Becket, our good Chancellor, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Primate of all England. Lords. Our best congratulations to his grace! Becket. My liege, let my humility decline This honour, I beseech— Henry (in his ear). Nay, Thomas, keep For imposition-time i' the church, your Nolo Archi-episcopari!—Put this other Pigeon into thy scrip, poor man!— (Aloud.) We've said it: Now that is done we call'd ye hither for, To give some state and solemnness to the deed Ere it be sanctified by ritual Which we much reverence, and will observe In all its just assumptions,—now disperse, Each to his several duty. I to mine. [Exit. [The Lords take leave, with much courtesy towards Becket. Becket. Your lordships' lowliest, most devoted slave!— [Exeunt Lords. The Second Man of the kingdom!—My ambition Mounts then its hoped-for towery throne; and there Sits crown'd with the proud mitre, scarce o'ertopp'd By one star of the regal diadem!— Am I indeed the son of Gilbert Becket?— How my soul swells!—like his who pinnacled On some high-pitch'd, realm-skirted promontory, Takes in the immensities around, beneath, Skies, seas, and continents, with rapturous gaze! How mine eye kindles! How my spirit burns Like yon great sun, brighter as it moves higher!— My very frame seems grown gigantical! I feel as I could overstride the earth— Yea, grasp heaven's ruling orbs in my two hands! Thou purer air that makest the mountain-pine Shoot up till he befits his lofty station, Why shouldst thou not descend in nourishing dews To make high-natured men pre-eminent Of form as mind?—Becket! thou 'rt in the clouds; Sublimity makes thy brain swim—thou 'rt not fit for it! He 's only great who can despise his greatness. Be not the night-fly drawn into the flame By thy blind love of splendour, and there burnt! True Magnanimity hath no outward measure, Nor is reveal'd by that. Is not the emmet Sagacious as the elephant? To our minds Alone, we may—by custom of great thoughts, By venturous deeds and versancy with power, Ambrosial food of books, august discourse, By ever straining towards some height from which Our former selves look little—to our minds We may add stature, cubit upon cubit, Until in them we become Anakim, Nobler than earth e'er form'd!— 'Tis reasonable, I do confess, to think that this fine essence, Grandeur of soul, should breathe itself throughout The mien and movements: every word should speak it, Howe'er so calm—like the pleased lion's murmur! Each tone, glance, posture, should be great with it. All levity of air, too buoyant cheer, The o'er-familiar smile, salute , and chat Which sinks us to the low and common level, Should be dismiss'd, and giant-minded things Disclaim the pigmy natural to most men.— No doubt!—that 's well!—that 's very well.— The Second Man of the kingdom!—This is much, And yet I might be more!—Not just the first, That were scarce possible; but—but—co-equal! To become which there gleams a ray. O Becket! What a brave course to run! lustrous, celestial, As thy bright birth-star's, when he would ascend To the world's zenith! Clouds and storms will gather Round him—nay, blot him o'er; but through them he Bursts soon, as I shall!—If at last he falls, He falls in splendour,—and all men must die! [Exit. SCENE IV. The Queen's Apartment. Maids of Honour. 1st Maid. Set all to rights: stir! stir!—See that the royal stool has its valance tucked up behind, like a house wife's skirt of a week-day,—or we shall get a scolding only proper for scullions. 2d Maid. Be brisk, lasses!—no one can tell when the devil 's at our elbow till we feel it pinched. 3d Maid. Will you never put away that mirror, Marian? The Queen detests all reflectors as much as you doat on them. 4th Maid. Do ye know why? Because Eleanor sees a black angel in them, and Marian a blonde one. 3d Maid. Ha! ha! ha! the vanity—look at her simperings! 1st Maid. Hush for your lives! Don't let a cricket's mirth be heard among us; she hates that too worse than a death-watch. 3d Maid. She thinks every jest aimed against herself— she's so good a but for it: that is her jealous and suspectful nature. 4th Maid. Pooh! then we shall have all the magpies banished from the park, because in her walks they seem to chatter and chuckle at her. [Exit, and returns. 2d Maid. Get thee gone, i' the Witch of Wokey's name! —here she comes, pondering and plotting with her Evil Genius. 3d Maid. What! with our dwarf governess? that extract of nettle-stings? 2d Maid. No, thank our stars!—but with the devil that possesses and tears her, Jealousy? Mum! [Enter Eleanor, who sits. The Maids of Honour stand a-row behind her. Eleanor. One of you has a sister, or some relative, called Rosalind—or Rosamond—eh? Or some such fantastical embroiderment of plain Rose—eh? 3d Maid. Yes, Madam: the name of my cousin's step-mother's niece,—no, my cousin's step-father's grand-niece, by the female side,—is, if it please your highness, Rosette. Eleanor. Nothing but Rosette, after such an ear-breaking pedigree?—away with her! None other of ye,—eh? Confess the truth, or it shall be torn from your tongue's-ends by burning pincers: confess! 2d Maid. I have a sister Rosamond, your highness. Eleanor. Ha! I thought truth would come out! Is she well-favoured? 2d Maid. Yes, Madam; fresh and fragrant, as bright of bloom and as innocent as a rosebud itself. Eleanor. Innocent? hear this!—So! so! so! so!—She was at the Chancellor's revel last night, your immaculate Rosebud? 2d Maid. Madam, I believe not— Eleanor. She was—Hypocrisy! Disguised there, and skulking into every corner save the kennel, where she should!—She was there, I say! 2d Maid. Truly then, Madam, not to contradict your highness, it must have been unknown to her nurse,—for she is yet but seven years old. Eleanor. Indeed?—(Aside.) How the Fury, for all her blazing torch, misleads me! Well, knows any one besides of a Rosamond, kin or acquaintance? 1st Maid. There 's Rosamond de Ros— Eleanor. What years has she? 1st Maid. As I guess, Madam, some fewer than ninety —She is one of the Gray Sisters. Eleanor. Humph!—a withered Rose; let her rot! Who else?—tell me no more of your babes or bearded women. 4th Maid. O lack! there 's another Rosamond—the goatherd's daughter! Eleanor. Goatherd? goatherd? Paint her to me. The king in sooth has some goatish propensities. 4th Maid. Madam, red-haired as a fox, and of a roan complexion: she is as huge of mouth and hideous as the Ogress that makes but four mouthfuls of an ox, and bolts little children for white bread— Eleanor. Good: that's enough. 4th Maid. There's Rosamond de Clifford too, Madam. Eleanor. Ay, what's she? 4th Maid. Why, Madam, if it please your grace, as beautiful as Aurora of a May-morning. Eleanor (starting up). Tell me her height to an inch— her hair, her walk? 4th Maid. Madam, so please you, her shape is about mine, as near as may be. Eleanor. Your shape?—She's taller, is she not? Less pursy too; less fat of the land upon her,—eh? 4th Maid. My very form and mien, Madam. Eleanor. The King love such a blowsabel?—Has any one else seen this Rosamond? Is she like our dairymaid here? 3d Maid. Madam, as like as if they were stamped with the one butter-print! 2d Maid. O yes, Madam: both made of the same Dutch cheese! 1st Maid. Twin-dishes of last week's curds, garnished with carrots to give them a colour! Eleanor. So much the better!—Her eyes, nose, mouth, complexion, what? 4th Maid. My own, Madam. Eleanor. Why, your eyes are round, small, green-gray, and rimmed with red like a carrier-pigeon's; your nose perks out from the middle of your face like the boss of a child's target; and your complexion is as pallid and silver-sick as a leper! 4th Maid. Madam, indeed, notwithstanding my disparagers here, Demoiselle de Clifford is called in her own shire— Fair Rosamond. 2d Maid. Fair, means nothing but white there: she has, you know, as her highness said, your parsnip skin and complexion. 1st Maid. Besides, she squints, and can look all round her, before and behind, like a rabbit. 3d Maid. Like a rabbit? nay, she has something of a hare-lip, that's certain; but to my thinking the worst about her is, she halts on the right leg. 4th Maid. Indeed I did hear she has six fingers to one hand,—now I have but five to either. Dwerga (from behind). That 's she! that 's she! as sure as jealous Folly Is of the feminine gender!—None but one, The paragon of her sex, could stir so much Green gall against her; as we see the Moon Hooted by choleric owls for her strange brightness!— Fair Rosamond is thy foil, thy rival, Queen! Seek her; she 'll soon shine out. Why, she must be A blazing-star of beauty, who can make These pale-faced mortals see such ruin in her! Eleanor. Rather that yellow worm whose reptile fire Shall lead my foot to tread it out! Dwerga. True! true! Sweet grandam!—Like a she-fox driven to cover, The death-expecting glare of her fine eyes Shall beacon us towards her den. I 'll be the terrier To worry her out; but you shan't muzzle me. Eleanor. How is it I ne'er heard of her before? Dwerga. O! O! O! O! tell thee of a ripe cherry Which all the birds peck at, and thou thyself A piece of wither'd bark, fit for the tanner! That were rare courtiership! Eleanor. ‘Fit for the tanner!’ I 'll see if I can pierce thy hide, thou harden'd one— [Strikes a silver bodkin into her. Next time I 'll stitch thy saucy lips with it. Scorn is thy mother-tongue, and borne because Thou speak'st none else: but thou 'rt of late become Malicious as old Hecate's pet of monkeys. Dwerga (between her teeth). Curse thee!— Why, so I am old Hecate's pet, Being thine!—No more of that sharp nudger, pray thee!— [Eleanor threatens it. Not saucy, Mistress sweet! but cockahoop With pride and hope to serve thee!—(Aside.) I could maul her! Eleanor. To roost there!—go!—begone! Dwerga. In you, before me, Spawn-colour'd things! I 'll give ye chalk enough To feed ye white.—Must they not in with me? Eleanor. Ay!— [Exeunt Dwerga and Maidens. I 'm sick of ye all, myself, mankind, the world, And gladly could groan out my rest of life Upon the dust this moment!—Thou shalt rue Thy pretty nickname yet, Fair Rosamond! To compass that will be a pastime!—Yea, I shall love well to catch this noxious gnat, And lean upon my wrist to mark its pain As it writhes round my bodkin, buzzing there Its feeble soul away in shrilly cries.— Beware of Eleanor, La Belle Disconnue! [Exit. SCENE V. A Room in the Palace. Henry, Prince Henry, Clare, De Lucy, De Eynsford, Glanville, De Bohun, Fitz-Urse, Radel, and other Courtiers. Henry. We are now at the goal of all our wishes, Now have we all our quarries within clutch, Both Church and State are now beneath our rule, The Crosier being fast bound unto the Sceptre; Now are we doubly king—ha, cousin Clare? Clare. Most true, my liege! for now your other self The Archbishop reigns associate in the realm, Heaven save your Majesties! Henry. Nay, one too much! But you shall shout that blessing with more joy, Albeit less jocular, when some seasons hence My little Harry here and I sit crown'd Together. Will it not be brave, young Sir? Prince Henry. Yes, and 'twill be my right; my mother told me. Oh, I 'll be such a king! I 'll have a gown Of velvet stiff with gold, and a tall plume Shall flap you in the eyes when you look o'er me. Henry. Bold boy!—He makes a cock-horse of my truncheon When he can snatch it; and will make me, too, Bear him about the chamber on my back When Dick and he play kings; then both will mount And lead their jaded father such a time! You 'd laugh to see the round-faced little villains, How earnest they 're about it!—You are a father Too, Cousin! Clare. Yes, but not an o'er-indulgent.— Mark how his kingling-ship strides through the hall! Henry. He 's proud of his great yesterday; when Gwyneth Prince of North Wales, and Rheese of South, did homage At Woodstock, to us both as suzerains. The memory glads even me; 'twas a white day, And promises long peace: that Scotland's king, Malcolm the Maiden, likewise, should bow down Before my throne, and give his brother David As hostage for his faith—yes, all this fill'd My cup of joy to overflowing. France Hates us, but dreads; and hoists her ensign pale Begging for truce, where late her oriflamme Hung dripping o'er War's bed its bloody sheet. Now shall my subjects, like myself, throw by Contention's pillow, set with iron thorns, And rest from home as well as foreign brawls.— My Lord Justiciary!— [To him. We must reform The Courts; look you to that, Richard de Lucy! Justice, not blind, nor with both eyes a-squint As they are deem'd, but even and lustrous-bright, Shall fix their cold orbs on all things beneath her, With thorough-piercing rays, like winter stars, And not less pure from earthly influence. Plantagenet will be Pater Patriæ.— My Lord High Constable!— [To him. Let Commissioners Take census of all knights' lands which were known Under my grandsire Harry Beauclerc; state The services of each due to the crown,— Their name, their neighbourhood, their punctual nature; That so we may, at once and without fail, As Paul's bell sets the curfeus all a-tolling, Summon the realm's strength to defend its rights. De Bohun. 'Twill be a work like Domesday-Book, or better! Henry. But most we must restrain those sacred robbers— Those cowl'd and hooded highwaymen, the priests, Who fright my lieges, with the deadliest threats, Out of their coin, for venial faults; those Jews In Christian gaberdines, whose belts of rope Should be about their necks, and not their middles; Who drain the poor man's purse, for penances And absolutions, till it hang as meagre As a dried eel-skin, and himself scarce fatter. They, by this means, more taxes raise, 'fore heaven, Than come to our Exchequer!—What say you, Glanville, our jurist deep? Glanville. Their bold rapacity Stops not at threats; nor their licentiousness At love of money. My report saith here, [Taking out a scroll. An hundred murders, besides rapts and thefts, Have been, by priests alone, committed, since Primo Henrici Secundi to this present— I would say since your Majesty's accession— That 's scarce a dozen years. This Clerk, to wit, Of Worcester, now before the Court, at first Seduced the daughter, and then slew the sire— Henry. Yet these hot sons o' the Church will have him stand Before their loose tribunal! to amerce him Perchance in one cup less of wine per day Out of his flagon—that themselves may sin And suffer at like rate!—It shall not be! De Eynsford. Fain would the Mitre jostle with the Crown. Henry. Then let the weaker vessel of the two Be crack'd, be crush'd to dust, though it be mine! No! that bold rivalry must have an end; Now is the time, now while my own Archbishop Is aidant and abettant— De Eynsford. Here he comes. Henry. Good! Make him broad way for his suite and train, Until he stand before us. Enter Becket in monk's apparel, a small crucifix in his hands; attended by Gryme. Welcome, our Chancellor! Our Primate, and chief Dignitary of the Crown!— (Seeing him). Hey, Thomas?—No?—My lord!—Your Grace!—how 's this? Are we to masquerade it o'er again, By day as well as night?—What means this drugget? A shirt too of black horse-hair that peeps out Coyly beneath his tunic! and clog-slippers To sheathe his hoseless feet!—Where shall I find Thomas à Becket under all these weeds? Becket. He will be seen anon. Henry. Thou 'rt in eclipse Show forth thy honest face again!—Thou who Wert wont to look so boon, and meet thy king With aspect shining in the oil of gladness, And such a flush of fervour on thy cheek That every feature melted in the smile,— Wherefore this face of adamant to me now? Becket. I am not what I was! Henry. What! not my Chancellor? Becket. No more, my liege: I come to render up that worldly office So ill-beseeming one now minister But to the King of Kings—Pray you, receive it. [Surrendering his staff of office. Henry. Ay? cast your staff official from you thus, Without consulting me? Becket. Sir, even so: I did consult two things which cannot err,— My conscience and this blessed crucifix. [Kisses it. Henry. Ha!—Has a serpent crept from out the dust Up my throne-steps to sting me i' the back, And slide away under the altar then? Becket. You do mistake me much: I have put off My former self as worse than childishness, The pomp and pride of state, the carnal mass Of sin that swell'd most hideous on my shoulders Bending me to the earth: I would become By prayer, self-discipline, and mortification, In very deed the consecrated thing I am in name. But this is all! My love, Allegiance, loyalty, are what they were, And should be, still. Henry. “You do mistake me much”— “A consecrated thing”—and “that is all”— Then prithee, Heart's-Ease! since you show two faces Under one hood—changed, and not changed—let 's have Some proof you are the man we spoke with yesterday: The trial of that Clerk comes on at noon Before our Bench—is it not so? Becket. My liege, I have considered—much—upon the matter— Henry. Ay, with your conscience and your crucifix, Which you took but small counsel of before!— Hypocrite! Becket. Nay, most faithful, frank, and fair! See you how innocent am I of this: Here is a rescript of Archbishop Theobald (And I must yield unto so good a man!) Inhibiting the trial of all priests Before profane tribunals. Henry. That I gave you Admitted, not inhibited, false monk! Becket. But this another is, and later one.— Good Richard, show his Majesty the parchment [To Gryme, who shows it. Sign'd by my predecessor, and given up Even with the ghost. Henry. Fitz-Urse, I say! Fitz-Urse? Fitz-Urse. Dread sire, I fear 'tis so: that villain Gryme, Your Grace's confidant, betray'd his trust, And in the old man's moments of last weakness (I being shut out as one of the profane) He got this ready deed Death's signature, Incapable of correction or erasement, And gave 't to Becket. Becket. Becket, thou insolent! Know who I am—beneath the King alone, And him but in a temporal sense—above Even him, as representative of St. Peter, And God's vice-gerent on this English earth. Clare (to Glanville). I thought humility sat heavy on him, So off he throws it—like a sin! Glanville. He 's evidence Against himself. Mark how the King's eye glitters! Henry. Have I then thrust my most delicious sops Into the mouth of an ungrateful dog That turns and strives to tear the hand which fed him?— Well then, our Saxon proxy of St. Peter, To give thee further time for prayer, full swing For self-disciplinance (which I confess Thou hast great need of!) here thou art relieved Of that most duteous office, and much worldly, The Arch-deaconship—thou 'lt find perchance in this Some taste of mortification to begin with! Becket. My liege, the archdeaconry is a church holding— Henry. By Mahound, you say well! and therefore shall A churchman have it:—Geoffrey Radel, ha? Radel. Sire. Henry. Be the new archdeacon of Canterbury.— Farewell, Saint Thomas!—Ply your beads and scourge Fast as you please: we will not stay to lett you! [Exeunt King and Courtiers. Becket. My heartiest hate, and hater, made archdeacon Of my own See!—that is a thorn which gores, Not merely pricks the side!—Archdeacon? rather Arch-devil!—He will raise a hurricane To rock my belfries—yea, will ride it too! But let him fear a shower of blood may lay it, From his own sides!—This fate of grandeur, I Look'd for; the sky-ascending bird becomes The plainer mark. Why, hypocrite?—hypocrite! Were not my services unto the King Sincerest, whilst I was his servant? Now That I am servant of the Church alone, Should they not be sincere to it? His fault, If foe to it, he thus will make him mine! No man can serve two masters,—save they be At one!—Am I to blame that loftier steps Give larger views, and clear from mists, through which Haply I err'd where they are thick below?— Howe'er he choose to reason it, let him!—Here He hath mark'd out the mortal lists, and trumpeted Himself to the high combat; he hath thrown His glove even in my cheek! Becket may chance Return it with a gaunlet, that shall fall Upon him like an iron meteor!— I can divine him thoroughly, and his purposes! This king delves hard beneath St. Peter's rock; But ere it sink an inch, the mighty coign Shall bruise him, past more sapping, with its shoulder! We are upon the eve of chances strange; Heaven will defend its own! SCENE VI. A Street in London. Fitz-Urse and Fier-à-bras. Fitz-Urse. Spare not the rowel, good Sir Mottram! Speed To Clifford Castle, and fetch thence as swift Thy precious charge, girt with a loyal band Of lusty gentlemen, for grace and guard, To Woodstock, to the Labyrinth; of that, As of the Lady's self, thou art made Warder. Fier-à-bras. Thou 'rt the king's under-voice; 'tis he that speaks? Fitz-Urse. He! (Showing a signet.) Fail in nought: thou know'st his fiery humour When his strong will is foil'd; though he be else So mild of mood and soothable. Fier-à-bras. Gramercy! I love not dallying with the lion's beard Though he 's a generous beast!—it has been pluck'd too, Sorely of late.—I would I were an arrow! [Going. Fitz-Urse. You'd miss your mark then! Stay a pace: take this,— [Giving a letter. Else will the turtle-dove scarce trust herself I' the clutches of so grim a kite—flee! flee! [Exit Fier-à-bras. Her father sickens, and fierce Eleanor threatens, Or she would never leave her brake at Clifford For all this Woodstock cooing of the king!— Plague on 't! what trouble and lost time to lay Love's ambush! If not all beset with flowers, And a plush alley made to 't for her feet, Dove-calls to lure her, streams to purl persuasion, Nice-footed Woman will not step into 't! She will sin daintily, be humour'd to 't, Or take huff, and not sin at all! She loves The pleasant way to 't more than the place itself! When you find Reginald Fitz-Urse employ'd Digging a pitfal for a fawn to pet, May he be caught himself!—Plague on the foolery! [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Base-court of the Palace. Enter De Morville and De Traci, meeting John of Salisbury and Walter Mapes. De Traci. Hey, Master Bookworms! have ye heard the news—the wonderful news? Mapes. Heard it forsooth?—had I no more ears than a fish, I must have heard it. Hath it not stricken the whole city aghast, like an earthquake? All London is in the streets; yet who told it me I cannot guess, for every one seemed dumbfounded! John of S. I am sorry the Primate has gone so far. De Traci. Ay, ay, here's a feat indeed!—put this in your next Romance, Master Walter! put this in your “Sang-Real” or what d'ye call it? De Morville. Let it be Sang-episcopal, and no Romance, if you love me! Mapes. Nay, by King Arthur and all his Knights! there will be some dragon's blood spilt at all events. Both are such fire-breathers! John of S. But is the tale as true as it is new? Hath he indeed cited into Court the great Earl of Clare, cousin and friend to the king? and launched excommunication against William de Eynsford, as puissant a knight as ever wore spurs, and as proud a baron as ever tramped over drawbridge on steed shod with silver? De Morville. No less true than portentous. Becket was born for a soldier, though he has turned out but a bishop. Seeing battle inevitable he strikes the first blow, and if not a crusher 'tis a confounder. Mapes. What! he lays church-claim to Tunbridge-Castle? De Morville. Ay, “cousin Clare's” castle, as an apanage of his own diocese; and his pet-incumbent being ejected by Sir William, head-foremost, from some church—I forget its name—he ejects Sir William, sans cérémonie, from all churches whatsoever! Mapes. How does the king take this?—does he not rage, foam, call down the devil's blessing upon Becket? De Traci. Oh, sir, no torrent half so still! no cataract Is quieter!—Ha! ha! ha! ha!—how goes the chanson, Walter the Jongleur?—thus? Sings. Taillefer, qui très-bien chantoit, Sur un cheval qui tôt alloit, Devant eux alloit chantant De Charlemagne et de Rolant, Et d'Olivier de Vassaux, Qui moururent en Roncevaux! Mapes (to John of S.). Mark this French popinjay: he sees the air Grow clouded with thick shafts of death, yet still Chatters and hops and sings! John of S. Ay, light of heart As heels! Mapes. Yea, and as light of head as either!— Sir Hugh, 'twill be a bustle!—'Twere more strange The king should not be vex'd, than vex'd beyond All measure. He has been disappointed much! De Morville. His swan has turn'd a rank wild-goose! Mapes. Or rather His duck has turn'd a fire-drake!—Welcome, Peter! Enter Peter of Blois. Run not so fast, good brother-scribe!—Hast thou too Been frighted by this thunder-storm just burst As broad as England, out of thy calm cell? Peter. Marry, my wits are so distract, I run Two ways at once,—and all ways but the right! I wish'd to seek the father of the flock, Th' Archbishop,—and find me i' the lion's den! De Morville. Alas, poor sheep! Peter. Pray tell me, have the sun And moon not come together—clash? De Morville. Thou 'lt see The whole land cover'd with their fiery splinters, Ere long, be sure of it! Dost thou not feel The air about thee glow with agitation? Peter. Methinks my ears do feel a little hot! Mapes. I'll make them tingle. What say'st thou for thy patron? Thou 'dst ever have it he was too immersed I' the fount of England's Helicon; or entangled In the fine meshes of philosophy; Given up to science mathematical, Arithmetic, astrology, and so forth; To rhetoric, logic, ethic, and to law, Besides those gallant studies, wit conceipts, We lighter gentry deem of weight: why, man! Those maggots of his brain are very snakes, Which one hot day has brought forth ready-fang'd And wing'd, to be the plague of this poor realm! Peter. Thy crany seems something worm-eaten too, And leaks apace; or warm imagination Hath crack'd thy poet skull, and out fly crotchets! But Walter, all thy volatile grubs o' the brain Are harmless—only to thyself! Mapes. Heaven grant The same may still be said of Becket's too, Harmless,—save to himself! John of S. A truce of tongues!— But what will come—what can—except vast ill, From this fierce struggle between Church and State? Which of these wrestling Titans shall be thrown? Peter. England 's too little to contain them both, I fear—I fear! Mapes. How does the Primate bear him During this rout? De Morville. I 've come from him but now: My message was, that he might please recal His rash anathema against De Eynsford, As ne'er such sentence has been, since the Conquest, Fulmined without fore-notice to the king. Mapes. Well, how demean'd he him? De Morville. Meek as a nun. Mapes. Nay, but in very truth? De Morville. In downright truth! He neither stamp'd, nor champ'd, nor raved, nor swore,— Except by St. Bartholomew's holy thumb, Which he (who whilome play'd as lief with dice Of dead saint's bone, as ivory!) now caresses Linnet-like in his breast, and kisses oft And soft, as he e'er did sweet sinner's hand!— No, sir! he sucks his tooth, and sends me back With this submiss and placable reply— His humble service, 'twas not for the king To tell him whom he should absolve, or whom Pronounce accursèd. Mapes. An ungracious speech! De Traci. I say unmannerly! most unpolite!— (Sings.) Telle est coutume de bourgeois, N'en verrez guères de courtois! His father was a London cit and his mother a Syrian bondslave: where should he get good-breeding? De Morville. The saucy shaveling! Were it left to me, I'd so mash his lips together with a blow of my steel glove, they should no more separate again than if Death had glued them into one—the traitor! John of S. Nay, not a traitor; 'tis too hard a word. Enter Brito. Brito. Gentlemen, to the King! De Morville and De Traci. We 're with him! [Exeunt these and Brito. Peter. The men of war gone!—what will become of us? Mapes. We have nothing to do but sit agape at each other and croak, like a congregation of toads round a pool —till we are squash'd into mummy by a shower of missiles. Peter. Saint Longinus preserve us! John of S. Why seek we not our calm, secluded cells, And there in study or dim meditation Consume the soul-improving hours? Let death Come when it will, and how it will, what matter? Since it will come at last!—These mad turmoils Of the outer world, what are they unto us But noise of Centaurs and of Savages Fighting ev'n at their feasts?—For idle Courts, The mountain-shaded moors where nothing stirs Save the wild daffodil or crispèd fern Or long lithe broom that flows with every breeze, Or thistlebeard scarce wafted on, less make A melancholy desert unto me: The murmuring branches and the flowers that kiss Each other's ear in talk, please me far more Than whisperers of follies, hearers of them, Or those who lay their fond heads on your neck But to void scandalous venom there at ease: For blustering camps, I love the liquid brawl Of rivulets, the caw of rooks, much better; Yea, than the lisp of a Circean dame Or babble of a living doll, had rather Hear the soft winnowing of a pigeon's wing As it doth circle round its dovecote o'er me; And fain this challenge proud of trumps would change For sound of shepherd pipe or village bell: Would'st thou not, Peter? Peter. Yes,—so I 'll away To the Archbishop's palace! [Exit. Mapes. Ha! ha! ha! the village-bell?—the dinner-bell, he thought you spoke of! Among all flowers 'tis the Canterbury bells he is most in love with: these are the rural objects which give Peter a taste for the country! John of S. He is a Frenchman too!—I 'll to my dormitory, and finish my “Contemptibilities of Courts.” [Exit. Mapes. And I as his chaplain must attend the king, to preach patience, and give him absolution for his oaths— after each repentance. [Exit. SCENE II. The King's Closet. Henry enters, and sets down his cap. This bonnet galls me: 'tis too tight—or stiff— Or ire hath swoln my brow.—Who could be calm? A hypocrite! an upstart! an arch-traitor! Rebel! apostate from his civil faith! But worse—far worse! false-hearted to his friend!— And such a friend! who made him all he is, Far more than he should be!—O soft of brain! My lady-mother, Empress Maud, was right When she did warn me 'gainst this wily priest; But women are suspicious where they hate As credulous where they love; I did not trust her: That was o'er-wisdom! Men themselves Affection oft makes womanish,—nay weaker! Friendship like love is folly, and the fervider The blinder!—How he hath illuded me! I might have known his bold and dangerous nature When at Toulouse, with vehement desire, He urged me lay imprisoning hands upon The person of my suzerain, there besieged, Louis of France; this show'd how light he deem'd Of fealty and firm devoir to kings. What! he will have his rochet for a flag Flaunt over Tunbridge Castle? Ay, and hurl Heaven's own stored bolts, with hand unscrupulous As he would fling a quoit, 'gainst whom he will?— Becket, bethink thee: that same Hill of Fortune Thou clomb'st so fast by the precipitous side And takest high airs upon, hath broke more necks Than Rock Tarpeian or Leucadian! 'Twere safer to have mounted by the slope, And kept thy senses steady!—Thou would'st fain Play Dunstan o'er again, but we 'll enact No Edwy, no girl-king!—Be sure of it.— Now ere we buckle us to this business, One thought for my fair Rosamond. Poor bird! I must weave close thy verdant Woodstock bower, And make thy prison blissful as secure; Fitz-Urse hath had command. There is a Labyrinth Of marbled halls and rooms; of orchard walks, Fountains and freshening streams and bright parterres, All hidden in a dell, and umbraged o'er With the huge crests of brow-commingled trees, Disposed in such erroneous ordinance As leads all progress retrograde, and makes The intruder quaintly turn himself still out. It was devised by my late Chancellor,— These Churchmen ever were great architects, Planners and plotters—maledictions on them!— But will at least serve now my dearest need. The she-hawk is less keen to track her prey, Less fell to swoop upon it, than is Eleanor On her that flees for shelter to my bosom. Lord Walter is fall'n sick, they say—death-sick; He hath no masculine heir; so if he die His gentle daughter will, by right of kings And custom of the realm, become my ward, Her fortune and her fate be in my hand: Perchance I scarce had else been chosen protector, Or she at Woodstock now. 'Tis well even so! 'Twill be my refuge too from toils of state And broils of home: not a mere dull repose, But sweet intoxication of delight With one whose gracious beauty is a frame Only to close in far more precious charms, Exquisite tastes, refinèd sense, and wit Which once shone forth with playful lustre, till Of late, alas! bedimm'd too oft with tears. I must restore her by all fondest means Unto her peaceful self and placid cheer, Or the sweet Rose I've gather'd to my breast Will die there with the very warmth it feels.— Much is before me. Now to Clarendon, And bend my haughty Primate till he kiss His own feet if not mine.—Ho! there— Enter Knights of the Body, and Mapes. Arm, gentlemen! Make yourselves steel from top to toe, and bear Your battle-axes bright. Let a stout score Of men-at-arms attend us.— [Exeunt Knights. Walter Mapes, Go you to Bishop Folliott, our good friend, Say he will ride with us to Clarendon. No quips nor quillets now, sir; make no legs, But use them nimbly rather than your tongue, As we have told you!— [Exit Mapes. Wit hits all things nicely But the right times; it will be always shooting!— Now my ex-Chancellor! [Exit. SCENE III. An Alcove at the Labyrinth. De Clifford, in a chair, sick. Rosamond attending him. De Clifford. No, no, there is no hope, fond child! for me: The sun of my life's day is in the west, And shortly will go down! Rosamond. Droop not, my father! Let not the heavy spirit sink the flesh To earth before its time!—This journey sure Hath shaken you over-much? De Clifford. Not it! not it! I follow'd at full easy pace: the change Took me so far from the grave-side at home; That's all!—for here's another at my feet. Rosamond. Think less on Death, and he 'll think less on thee, Dear sir!—There's medicine that the mind may minister To the afflicted clay, its partner frail,— A hopeful spirit!—'tis the best restorative! Most life-giving Elixir!—The good Nuns Who taught me the whole little that I know, As art's choice secret taught me this. Look up! Look on thy Rosamond, thy bower-maiden, Look in her brightening face and learn its smile! De Clifford. I do look on thee—as my Minist'ring Angel, That soothes, but cannot save!—And I do smile To see thy vain dissembling with thyself Of the sad truth thou know'st at heart—Now, now Put up thy wings to hide thine eyes, and weep! Rosamond. I'll not believe 't! It can—shall, not be true!— The king's physician will be here anon, A learned leech who studied with the Moors, He is infallible!—Meanwhile this air Which keeps the woods so green, the birds so gay, The flowers so blooming-fresh, must revive thee: Doth it not breathe most dulcet o'er thy brow? Full of most cordial balm, warmer, and friendlier Than at the Cliff which overhangs the Ford Where our bleak Castle stands? De Clifford. Ah Girl! thou wert not Born there, nor reared, as I; else thou hadst loved Those barren rocks like one of their young eagles!— Bred up at Godstowe Nunnery hard by, Thou, like the hunted coney, fain return'st To thy old covert here, howe'er so fatal! Rosamond. I thought it might preserve thee at the least, If none else.—O dear father! call me not Cold-hearted to the cradle of my sires! 'Twas but in thy health's cause that I dispraised it. How oft I've ranged o'er those far-sighted peaks, Gazing as full-eyed as the mountain-roe On the great prospect, feeding but on its beauty, Rude pasture though it be! How long stood mute, Or like a willow whispering to myself, Down by the stream who swallows his own roar In his deep gorge, dread moat! which Nature delved With course irregular round our fortress-hill. De Clifford. My cloud-hung aerie!—blank for every storm, And baffler of it!—Ocean bursts to spray On the firm rock, and so to hurtless showers, Heaven's deluge upon thee!—You draw the picture Featly, my girl! Rosamond. 'Tis graven trait for trait Upon my heart.—I'm a De Clifford too, Though last, least, lowest! Even to girlish me Stern Nature hath her terrible charms sublime. De Clifford. Better than these slight bowers! Rosamond. O far other! De Clifford. It warms my veins like spiced wine to see thee Swell thy young throat as a sweet bird, and praise Thy dwelling in the wilderness!—Go on: Thou 'rt full of it. Rosamond. I see it now before me, Rearing its bulk precipitous from the strand. From crag to steepy crag the eye mounts up, Although the foot may not, those giant stairs Listed with verdure, fathoms aloft! De Clifford. A bow-shot Full—at the least! Rosamond. Those air-suspended eaglets Soar, far beneath the summit, and like rooks 'Gainst abbey walls, scream hovering at their nests, Within its rifted face: Pines on its ledges Waver like plumes; and yon small patch of briars Like blustry mosses, sway in the wild wind You cannot hear sing through them. De Clifford. O but they do Whistle most shrill! Rosamond. Heightening the Cliff's tall front Sits our huge Castle, like a crown of towers; Their rugged coigns, grey jewels! in the beam Smooth glittering; whilst o'er those battlements Darker than thunderclouds, the warder 's lance Peeps like a rising star! De Clifford. Ay, and my pennon Upon the Keep itself?— Rosamond. Blazons the sky With flickering hues, broad Streamer of the North, And blends them with the rainbow's! De Clifford. As brief-lived Will now be all its bravery!—Yet it brings Me back some youth to think of my past days, And my loved birth-place!—But I'm better here, I am, my child!—Ay, ay, proud Clifford Castle! Thou like thy master nodd'st unto thy fall, And soon like him wilt moulder down to dust! Rosamond. Alas! alas! both may live long!— De Clifford. Proud fortress! I have no son, no heir who can uphold Thy feudal strength and grandeur with his own. Thou 'rt but the changeful birthright of the winds From henceforth, or their reckless tenancy! Foul ravens will thy ruins hoar inherit, The wildcat litter there, the Moon alone With vacant gleam light up thy roofless hall, Or smile, pale Lady! through thy lattices: Along thy festive floors will reptiles creep With slimy trails, and make vile sport in corners, Sole revellers here! whilst the more brutish kind Graze thy rank courts, or use thy stalls, which echoed The war-horse neighing 'mid his amber corn, As mangers bone-bestrewn and dens to rot in! Rosamond. Let's home, my father! let us once more home! Enter Fier-à-bras. De Clifford. Noble Sir Warder!— Fier-à-bras. Greeting from the King; Who promises, if business hold him not, To sup at Woodstock Palace, and to-morrow Visit De Clifford with his noble Daughter. De Clifford. We thank his Majesty. Save you, Sir Mottram! [Exit Fier-à-bras. No, thou soft-passion'd creature! thou self-sacrifice, Still offering up thy life for those thou lovest, We will not home again, because my follies Forsooth talk louder than thy gentle wisdom. The she-wolf shall not ravin my poor lamb That would, too fondly, follow me to the wilds From its warm fold,—and I o'er-weak to save it! Thou camest here for my cause, dreading thyself The insidious wiles of love more than of hate, Henry than Eleanor: but listen, dear-one! Whether I live,—as juggling hope suggests To thy most cheatable affection,— Some little time, or die—Nay, cease thy tears, And listen: thou wilt have defender none Against thy willing blood-quaffer the Queen, Except his Majesty. Besides, me dead, Thou 'lt be his Ward, and he can then enjoy His will of all thou hast, in thy despite, Thy lands, thy tenements, thy gold, thy jewels, The virgin treasure of thy beauty,—all! Such is the royal licence of these times, At least if might makes not the right, it takes it, Fatal no less to thee!— Rosamond. Then I 'll return To Godstowe Convent, and give up at once All, with the world,—except what I prize more. They love me there, and will with matron arms Receive their filial Novice back again. De Clifford. Novice in sooth thou art!—Each Convent, girl! Is but a home-preserve of game for kings, A coop where liquorish Barons fat betimes Their fowls of whiter meat; and ruffian losels Poach—when the glutted lord o' the manor sleeps! Go not thou back to Godstowe: 'tis in vain! The grating is no bar, the shrine no sanctum, The veil itself to dead-cold Chastity No shroud from violating eyes, no cyprus Wherein her pure composèd limbs may keep Their icy form and bloodless tint, untouch'd, Unstain'd by sacrilegious hands! They would Rifle a heaven-descended Saint, if tangible, Who stood for adoration on the altar! Rosamond. I know the times are fearful. De Clifford. Better far Than trust their lawlessness, trust to his love Who has oft sworn thee his next Queen. Dame Eleanor,— Besides that she might mother thee in years,— Drinks a slow poison daily—enviousness! Rosamond. His Majesty, though generous, most sincere Of purpose— De Clifford. Move not then, I say, his pride By seeming doubt; nor stir and thwart at once His hot desires by over-coyness. Be Trustful, and thou wilt make him more trust-worthy. Mine own ambition prompted me before To weave the bond between ye, as a cord Whereby to climb up silkily myself Unto dame Fortune's chamber of intrigue: But now my love for thee—my fears—my hopes— Ambitious hopes for thee alone, my child!— Prompt the same counsel. Do not break that bond: 'Twill be a cable to thy safest mooring In the fierce storm which shall take up my dirge And fill the land with sighs. Rosamond. What mean you, Sir? De Clifford. I am already half i' the other world And catch a glimpse of fate!—It shall be so! England will soon be rent from sea to sea, And throne and altar slide to the abyss!— Now lead me in, for I am faint and chill. Rosamond. O for this sluggard leech!—he crawls, though life Is in his lips! De Clifford. And death too!—It will come Quickly enough without him! Rosamond. He will give you Wormwood, if you're so bitter. Come, you jest— That 's well! There 's hope when the heart laughs, Even though the brow be grave.—Lean on me, Sir! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Walk in the Labyrinth. Enter a Physician blindfold, led by Gabel. Physician. Am I to go much farther in the dark? Gabel. Only one other round, and a quirk, Sir. Physician. Bless me I think I have gone as many as an ass in a mill!—This muffling is worse than that of a Moorish damsel, for she at least has the use of her eyes: mine are no more use to me than if they were glazed with green lead like a stuffed owl's. Gabel. Come on, doctor: don't hurt that post with your head. What a pity! Physician. Pity! pity you didn't speak a little sooner!— Pity forsooth? Gabel. Ay, pity on my life Sir, that such a learned head as yours should have got such a crack! Physician. Take care it happen not again, or thy own numbskull shall get a crack, and that about the nape of the neck too!—'Tis hanging-matter to mistreat a man of my importance, let me assure thee. Gabel. Lord, Sir, are you a man of importance? I never could ha' guessed it!—Come on again—Stoop, Sir, like a goose under a gate, stoop! [Exeunt. Scene changes to an Inner Court. Re-enter Physician and Gabel. Gabel. You are to stand here, Sir, awhile, by yourself, please you Master man of importance! Physician. What, still in the dark! Gabel. Why yes, doctor; every dunce can stand in the dark—'tis only shutting your eyes and looking straight forward before you. It is my way, and a shrewd one, trust me. Physician. I do believe thou art skilful in standing i' the dark!—Get thee gone, for a perfect dunce! and send me a leader who is not absolute knave as well. Gabel. If he is to be found, with all haste doctor! [Exit. Physician. Pestiferous lout!—There is in simple-hood Ofttimes a sleek-soft, sleepy cunningness Which moves more bile than roguery direct. But I 've that here perchance will bring ye begging To Charity's bleak door, from this warm berth, For swine's soup and black bread!—I can avenge My sovereign-queen and self at the same time; 'Tis good craft to hit two birds with one bolt, Though but a sparrow and a cock o' the woods.— Mum! I hear ringing footsteps on the stones, Heavy as hammers' clang; some horse curvets Hither upon two legs— Enter Fier-à-bras. Fier-à-bras. Physician, follow me. Physician. What! in these winkers, Clamped on me, like a hoop about a hogshead? Fier-à-bras. Take this strong rein into thy hand: now follow! Physician. O Avicen! thy son playing bo-peep!— Hold fast, good sir, or I shall fall on my sinciput. [Exeunt. SCENE V. The Court before King's-Manour Palace, Clarendon. A Sentinel on guard. Several persons assembled. John of Oxford and Geoffrey Radel. John of O. What breeds the Council better than debate I marvel? It sits long. Radel. Would it were up! The wind is icy-keen within this court.— Hey! here comes Walter all a-muck!—Wrap up! It blows steel-needles!— Enter Mapes as from the Council Room. After him De Broke. Mapes. Pewh! a delicate storm To that within!—Could'st stretch thy neck Door-wards, and yon tall axe-man not behead thee, Thou'dst hear a storm indeed! John of O. We have heard much tumult. Radel. Tell us, good Walter! what is't like? Mapes. What like? The roll of thunder, roar of seas, and groan Of heart-burnt mountains, crash of cataracts, All mingled dense as the dark angels' cry Of mutual torment; or those threatening voices From Chaos 'gainst Creation, yell'd by night, Which make the firm stars tremble in their spheres. John of O. Englisht,—a mighty hubbub. Mapes. I do assure you— The roof rebounds as from a Cyclops' forge At full-sledge work above it; you expect The stones to fall each moment on your head— John of O. Well, well! but does the Primate yield? Mapes. Our Bishops Stand front to front as on a chess-board; some Are the King's bishops, some the Archbishop's bishops: These be the fiery tongues that make the blaze Hottest, and keep the fiercest bicker up; To which the laity's is but lambent flame Crackling and spitting. These, claw'd close together, As mill-wheels tooth in tooth, each urges on His giddy-pated neighbour, shoulders him, Kisses him hatefully with bespattering lips, Or stares quite mute with ire. De Broke. Furies in frocks! Mapes. I marvel the walls bilge not, with so much Foul fluency as swags within them.—Peter! Enter Peter of Blois. What news? what news? how goes it on? is 't done? Peter. 'Tis done—and undone—we are all undone! I know not what! They say there are no wolves In England since the Conquest—there's a den of them! John of O. But tell us, will the Archbishop brave it out, So obstinate? Peter. He stands like twice his size, The sole immoveable thing in that commotion! Mapes. I think he hath a cloven hoof, to stand So firm, on but two legs! Peter. I fear he'll have What's worse,—a cloven head! John of O. Doth the king speak? Mapes. The king speaks thunder-claps; and every word Blasts where it strikes!—'Tis fearful even to friends. De Broke. I ne'er saw steed upon the edge of battle With such a bloodshot eye or nostril broader! Methinks the very fierceness of his glance Cuts like a shining sword. Peter. There will be mischief! Heaven guard his grace, the Primate! Sentinel. Haro! Haro! [Fitz-Urse, De Morville, De Traci, Brito, with men-at-arms, rush across brandishing their battle-axes, and enter the hall. De Broke joins them. Mapes. 'Dame! this looks serious. John of O. Will they stain their souls With such a crimson and redeemless sin As murder of God's High-Priest? It is horrible! Mapes. What care these swashing blades? One thing to them High-priest or heretic! Are not their acts All of the one blush-colour? Their most innocent, Rapine and ravishment! Men bred up in blood, They shed it free as wine. John of O. A Christless race! Peter. Mapes, jest not now:—Can their thick senses, judge you, Tell the fine difference 'tween sacred priest-flesh And popular carrion? Mapes. Not, though that were smoked In the rich fume o' the chalice 'till it smell'd A whole aisle off! Peter. Ventre!—I am a priest!— I 'll back to Blois!—Courez, mes enfans! courez!— Sauve qui peut! [Runs off. Mapes. Ha! ha! ha! Radel. Walter Mapes, Thou can'st do grinning mischief like a monkey! Mapes. Who could be grave to see a man frighted, like a crow from his provender, by a hollow rattle or red rag shaken in the wind? John of O. If danger did not make all things look serious, how ridiculous does it make most of our actions really! Mapes. Come, we will all laugh at this Frenchman tomorrow! John of O. Heaven grant it! [Exeunt omnes. SCENE VI. An Apartment in the Primate's house at Clarendon. Enter Becket with a sour stateliness; followed by the Bishop of Norwich, and Gryme. Becket. Sign all of ye!—Not even my ink's black cross Shall sanctify his godless Constitutions! I am no reed,—to bend at every whiff Of blustering tyranny!—no supple flagger! Ye Suffragans infirm! Norwich. My gracious lord! Will you then be the oak, whose testy pride Lowered not its head, till torn up by the roots? Becket. I will,—a stout, stern, soil-bound English oak, Shelt'ring a lowly church, a pious people, Which hears the wind's fierce whistle through his boughs Age after age, and scorns it—as a whistle!— Had ye but stood like me—by me—behind me— This storm had puffed its full, and we but waved it Off, with scarce-raised arms. We had not lost An acorn! Norwich. Please you, sir, our very lives! Marked you not those grim hatchet-men, that shook Aloft bright edges through the hall, to show Where death might drop from? Becket. Tut, a trick terrific To fool old babes into obedience! Me It fooled nor quelled. Gryme. Thrice Sanctimonious! here Are lords who crave admittance. Becket. I'll not see them: Begging-faced Bishops! paupers for pity's dole! Gryme. Your very venerable Grace! I spy A red broad hat, and leopard crest, among them. Becket. O! 'tis the Cardinal and the Uncle of the King: Let them come in! (Exit Gryme.) This seems respect at least. Enter Cardinal Philip, Earl of Cornwall, and the Grand Prior. Cardinal. Highest and mightiest Prelate of the realm, We come, negotiators of Peace, if not Plenipotential to conclude it, hoping Your Grace is thereto well disposed. Becket. Why not, Most Eminent? Within me all is calm As the hushed sea between his ebb and flood, Balancing when to roll.—Wherefore should I Love not this halcyon state?—love it not round me, Well as within me? Can the sea less whelm When smooth than rough, the headlong who disturb The stillness of its pure and deepy bosom? Kings—moonstruck kings! may lash that sea to foam, But not my mildness. They upon its rage Their puerile chains will as successless throw As upon Becket's ire,—if ever roused! Cornwall. My lord! my lord! you take too much upon you— Becket. My lord! my lord! you take much more to say so! Who am I but the Sacerdotal King Of this great state? who you?—a king impossible! Cardinal. You do forget your halcyon calm. Becket. The ox Of quietest front sublime, may be yet stung To anger, by a gadfly! What's your need with me? Cornwall. If you are bland again, we would say thus— Becket. Cannot his Eminence, the Legate, speak? 'Twere best, methinks, on church affairs. I listen! Cornwall (aside). If this pride fall not, Lucifer's never did! Cardinal. Let me, in mine Italian humour, serve For spokesman, though unwilling, to this mission.— It ne'er has been the policy of Rome To play the cat's-paw. Cornwall (aside). No, the lion's rather Making a prize of all! Cardinal. Nor meddle much With the hot instruments of civil broils, Except as mediator 'tween those who sway Such utensils, (you'll pardon, on the feast Of good St. Hilary, my lepid vein Which means to soothe, not stir!)—Now, my dear lord, Let me approach you in that blessed wise Of Peace-maker. A little hear me, pray: The Constitutions, called of Clarendon— Becket. Not so—they are not passed, wanting my sign! Cornwall (aside). How hushed a sea he is! Cardinal. Well then, these Articles To be called Constitutions with your sign— Becket. Never!—What Sixteen Articles which make The mitre a huge tassel to the crown! —A bare appendage!—the grave Bishops merely Chief foot-kissers of the King, not of the Pope, Sole osculation, sacred and sublime!— Which make all priests whate'er amenable Like common subjects to the Common Laws, And spiritual culprits even mount the block Where secular caitiffs die! O monstrous! monstrous! Most despot Articles which make the King Head of the Church, supreme, unqualified, Throughout his whole dominions!—'Tis impossible! Can ne'er in England come to pass such things! Cardinal. My lord, you state them with too round a mouth Of eloquence, too loosely large; at least As we do understand them. Cornwall. They are no more In substance than those which at Westminster You gave assent to. Becket. Be't so! Why repeat it? If it were given, 'twas given, and there's an end. Cornwall. Pardon me, humbly I beseech your grace, But that assent was far too vague and general, So boundless that it bound to nought at all! Becket. I'll give none other. That's a word of Fate! [Retires. Grand Prior. O! miserable kingdom! Becket. What wouldst have? Grand Prior. A patriot's wish! an old man's wish!—peace! peace! Cornwall. A good man's thou might'st add—a wise man's too! Becket. Ay, and a fool's as well! The idiot loves To bask against a sunny wall his days, With arms like dead boughs hanging, vacant eyes Fixed on the straw he sees not, and his mouth Gaping so idly it chops not the mess Laid 'twixt his teeth: He wishes, and has, peace: Is that to sample us? Cornwall. You are too keen And subtle a logician to be coped with By us, my lord. But there are reasoners Upon the side of these same Articles, You cannot easily silence. Becket. Which be they? Cornwall. Three hundred broad-mouthed bugles, whose loud blare Echoing through each portcullis, will call up The embodied Baronage of this realm, as one Mail-clad Colossus. Becket. I call down another More dread—the Angel of the English Church, With thunders armed,—whose very breath will scorch Your idol into ashes! Cardinal. Brother, perpend! You bring not king and kingdom under ban Without the Legate's voice: you are but chorus To his pre-eminent curse! Becket. Ay, but that Legate May be of other name than Philip then; Of clime less out-land to us; and of mood Less that of a good easy man than thine! Norwich (to Gryme). His Legateship had better have continued To pour some oil on these contentious waves, And haply smoothen them. Gryme. Had he more oil In his soft tongue than any whale, 'twould not Have stilled the master-wave at least! Cornwall. With us Are all the bishops— Becket. Traitors to God and me! Who treble-bolt against themselves each blade Of heaven's already forked fires!—Avaunt! [To Norwich, who approaches humbly. Touch not my hem with thy Iscariot kisses! Cardinal. He is too much for us—'tis all in vain! Grand Prior (falling on his knees to Becket). Wilt thou spurn my grey hairs?—and from thy hem Dash these half-childish tears? Becket. Richard de Hastings! Heir of the oldest Norman name renowned! Grand Prior of the Templars! thou kneel thus, Sacred with age and station? Grand Prior. I am almost Mere earth already: bowed towards the dust, To which I moulder inly, by the weight Of years and ills: 'tis little lowliness To kneel, where I must lay me down so soon. Becket. Prythee, arise—it not beseems thee— Grand Prior. Never! Till thou descend from what beseems not thee!— I am as fixed in humbleness, as thou In pride!—The shame of my prostration hang On thee alone!—My tears, an old man's tears, Damning as blood, be on thee, and cry up To piteous heaven for vengeance! Becket. Hold!—this hath The awe of very anathema in its sound, Though launched by lips unqualified!—Rise, sir! 'Tis as the Patriarch Israel on his knees Before another Joseph.—I am moved: That's much. Grand Prior. Then say thou grant'st my prayer, good son! Becket. I 'll sign these Articles—with a mere clause For mine own dignity—that they shall stand As laws of the kingdom, Salvo ordine nostro. Grand Prior. That salvo is more worthy of a sophist Than of a deep philosopher, my son! Ill Latinists though we barons be, 'tis plain Those learned words mean—Saving your own Order— And to sign Articles with such reserve, Is but to say,—these shall stand laws, when for us, But when against us, by no means!—'Tis but To sign in joint-bond for a general debt, With this provision—such bond shall be binding On all who have subscribed it—Save ourselves!— My son, be honester and more politic. Becket. Thou too, Grand Prior! join this league?—thou too, A military Monk, and altar-sworn To be true soldier of the Church!—Wilt thou Stab at her thus through me? Grand Prior. Alas! I am liker To fall on my own sword for patriot sorrow, If now such death were virtue:—I am old, And feeble, very feeble!—All my strength Is in my hoary locks!—but I would spend it, Laying that white appeal before thy feet, To save the Church and thee from their great foe— Becket. Why that's the king! Grand Prior. Thyself!—thou 'rt her chief foe, And thine own likewise!—Suicide prepense, Parricide of thy Holy Mother the Church!— Cornwall (to Norwich). Truth comes from Heaven, most sure! How it inspires That weak old man with vigour strange, and sense So super-natural to his own! Norwich. He pauses: He draws hard breath—he swoons— Grand Prior. Both—both shall perish— Hark! how the King raves!—See those glistening swords!— The Primate grasps the altar—blood! blood! blood! Save him!—His brains are on the floor!—O Becket! Hadst thou but listened when the old man prayed, This sacrilege had not been! [Swoons away. Becket. Great God! I yield!— Raise thee, good father! I have signed the scrolls— Thy prayer is heard! Grand Prior. Now lay me i' the tomb— [He is borne off. At Battle-Abbey, with mine ancestors— I 'm a Crusader, let my legs be crossed; Mark you?—Go tell the king—that—that—I'm dead. [Scene closes. SCENE VII. Eleanor's Closet. Eleanor and the Physician. Eleanor. But wherefore not, old dotard! have at once Poisoned him? Physician. “Poisoned!”—speak not so broad, your highness: You talk of poison as a common dose Like coloured aqua pura, with us,—ditto, ditto, To be repeated every night at bed-time! 'Tis not just so. Eleanor. How long will he be dying? Physician. Is not this chamber very old? Eleanor. What mean'st? Physician. Is there no craziness about it? Eleanor. Some I think within it! Physician. Ha! ha! ha!—But think you Are not the walls cracked here or there? Eleanor. As much as The emptier chamber of thy brain. Physician. No more?— I did but dread those seamy auricles Which oft to little ears without betray Secrets most close, and with their mystic echoes Magnify all that's breathed, as the lithe horn Reverberates mightily the small bray of man. Eleanor. I do not understand your chymic speech: Talk plain as me. Have you made sure the death Of old De Clifford? Physician. Hush! hush!—Thus it stands: I 've given him—Who's behind that tapestry there? It moves!—it doth conceal some prowler!— Eleanor. True; A felon watcher; go you, pull him out By the ears, still longer than your own. Physician. Ho! ho! [Pulling aside the curtain. Feline you meant, not felon: here is nought Save old Grimalkin! Eleanor. Watching for a mouse Less timorous than thee!—Go on, sir!—Now, What dost thou gape at? Physician. Here's a sliding pannel Under the fringe!—I see it! Eleanor. Cunning fox! That dost mistake a hencoop for a trap!— 'Tis an armoire, a cupboard, where I keep Some cates and cordials for refection: I see thou smell'st at it like other vermin. Physician. Truly a glass or so of aqua vitæ, Most gracious Mistress, were restorative After these fainting fits— Eleanor. Help thyself; go! Physician (filling a glass). This aqua vitæ is not that same draught You spake so freely of distributing?— Not simple aqua mortis, no? Eleanor. Thou fool! Thy low suspicions almost make me smile. Dost think I'd poison thee with aqua vitæ, When ratsbane's to be had? Physician. Faith, that is true! 'Tis cheap and potent death; but leaves the corse Unsightlier than should be, livid, and drawn Distort, as 'twere, within by tenter—hooks, With its last agonies upon it featured Too strong, and tale-telling. It is not safe, Never make use of it! Eleanor. Not even on thee: I will be guided by thy old experience In safe and skilful murder.—Now, good doctor, Go on. Physician. This poisonous talk hath almost choaked me. But to our case. The old lord ere I came Had long been under care o' the President Himself of our grave College, an adept At manslaughter—who hath saved me much trouble. Eleanor. Thou wert the first. Physician. Pardon me, gracious Madam: Ere me had President Disease been with him, Under whom doctors but licentiates are; I found the patient well prepared; for he Had Death's pale brand upon his wrinkled brow Marking him for the tomb. I only minister'd A gentle—quickener. Eleanor. Hastener, hurrier? Physician. Madam, Nought as I live, but somewhat—to help Nature, As we physicians say,—for he was dying; Merely instead of a preservative, A small exasperative,—nothing more! Eleanor. Then how soon is he dust? Physician. I could not say At all!—but, as I guess, he should be in His rattles about now. Eleanor. That's well!—here 's gold. And the gay Rose, didst drop a canker in it, To kill it quickly too? Physician. Madam, impossible! Were I so reckless and precipitate As you would have me, all would be found out, And we both hang'd together!—I'm too bold, I should hang miles below your Majesty!— Besides that, Mistress Rose sips like the birds Only pure water, which all minglement Would stain; and, like them too, cats, I believe, But what she culls herself. 'Tis hard to syrup her; Nathless, I'll find a way— Eleanor. Do, and thou'lt find it Strown with gold blocks to build a palace of!— Meantime go brew me something rich with venom, For household use. Physician. Dear Madam, be discreet! Eleanor. Discretion is a virtue for the mean, Not for the mighty! Physician. I 'm of the mighty ones! Thou ne'er hast done half the fine knaveries With thy bold indiscretion, which my “meanness” Hath wrought unknown in every civil land!— But for my exquisite discretion, I Had never scaped the tithe, nor been admitted As a preserver, where I have proved, and may Again prove, a destroyer! Eleanor. I have chafed Thy noble pride in villany, it seems, So loud a claim thou lay'st to bear the bell. Physician. Ha! ha! ha! ha!—your Highness might contend! Eleanor. Begone, sir, as you came; down those wry stairs, Through the court vaults, and out by the sewer.—Begone! Physician. It is the safest way, though none of the sweetest! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Before the Temple Church, at Northampton. De Bohun, Clare, and Leicester. Clare. His grace was very meek! De Bohun. He almost prayed On mouth and nose, as I have seen a Saracen! Leicester. And with what unction rare he scrubb'd the feet Of thirteen Beggars, like a polisher Who files the brazen toes of tarnish'd Saints Clean-yellow! Clare. But the best was, when he mix'd Among the poorer sort; 'twas as King Log Leapt on by swarming frogs!—how patiently He bore their foul splay hands on him, and saw Them wide agape with wonder at the lowliness Of such a heaven-sent thing! Leicester. Four ancient hags With beards like leopardesses, skins, and claws, Grossly familiar, would almost have torn him To quarters, each one striving to grasp all, So fierce their ravenous affection! De Bohun. See you Whither this sycophancy to the base people, And over-sanctity tends? Clare. O plain! He needs Support against the King, Barons, and Bishops Assembled now at Northampton to try him. Leicester. Yea, he will find 'twas not so light a fault To break his oath at Clarendon late signed, He would observe the Constitutions!—Shame Upon the Pope too that absolved him from it, As easily as for breaking a love vow! De Bohun. By Tyrmagaunt! the King will make him rue it In something bitterer than ashes! Clare. Harry Hath so much of the royal lion in him, That even when playing, faith, he gives a pat With closed paw, worse than an earnest blow From other hand! Now that he's swoln with rage Heaven help the hunter who has goaded him! Leicester. He 'll do such witty wicked things too!—What are here? Some of the royal grooms. Enter several Grooms. I 'll lay my spurs They have committed some new piece of roguery Worth hearing!—Well, good knaves, why d' ye laugh? Groom. My lord, at the brave guests we have just left at the Archbishop's inn, and their gambols there! Leicester. Guests? gamboling guests at the Primate's! Groom. We warrant they'll do justice to his stock of provender: not a grain of barley have they had these two days, that their stomachs might be a good guage for it. Leicester. Whom do you speak of—beggars, base-born churls? Groom. No, no, sir!—all high-bred as Pegasus himself; and bear their necks so proud, his Grace would fear even to caress them. If he attempted to curry their hides, they would kick his Sanctity into the kennel. Leicester. This fellow is so full of his trade, he can only speak in its figures. You do not mean your horses, villains! that you have left gamboling and gorging at the Archbishop's inn? Groom. No, Sir Knight, not our horses, but the King's— a score of them! all in his grace's saloon and parlours, for lack of better stables! A dozen of ourselves remain to wait on the guests, and see they have enough of forage and litter. Leicester. I told you what a pestilent wit the king could be! Clare. This is horse-play indeed! Groom. Ha! ha! ha! yes, sir, playing at all-fours!— plenty of horse-laughter too, ha! ha! ha!—there is such whinnying and squealing and flinging up of hoofs, and all fierce racketing and royster, that 'tis as good as if the inn were haunted by the Nightmare and her brood of foals, the noise sounds so infernal! Ha! ha! ha!—his grace himself, I think, will go prancing mad! Clare. But was this done by his Highness's order, sirrah? Groom. Can't say, my lord; I only did Master Adam the equerry's.—Come on, Sim! come on!—Ha! ha! ha! [Exeunt Grooms laughing. Leicester. There needs no order to the imps of mischief, From the great Father of it! nor to these Mock-devils, from the king: their piercing eyes Catch from his single fiery glance full light Of what shall please him, when himself scarce knows it. 'Tis marvellous the kind of intuition, And quick invention, even fools will have, If mischief's to be done! Clare. There 's no one thing Perchance could gall the pride of our haught prelate More than this insult! De Bohun. His ill-faith deserves it! Leicester. We shall be late to Council. Mark the sun. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Council-room. Henry, De Lucy, Cornwall, De Eynsford, Archbishop of York; Bishops of Winchester, Salisbury, London, Norwich; Glanville. Henry. Glanville!—there is a thing I'd say to you Before we enter on this business.— What was it? Pshaw! my head is in the mists, Or they in it!—O!—true!—We must not, Glanville, Let these poor squabbles 'tween that priest and us Prejudice nobler matters. You can guess What's in my mind. Glanville. I judge, Sire, as you speak Of noble matters, you must mean the cause You 've had so much at heart—the restitution, Betterment, stablishment, and general use Of that, long fallen into desuetude, That noblest of all noble things which man Ever invented for behoof of man, Trial of all accused, by their sworn peers Called jurors; and the name of the said practice,— Which shall go sounding down to latest times Join'd with your own, as its chief Advocate, Trial by Jury. Henry. Yea, good Ranulph, yea; But you great lawyers, in your deep research, And dabbling in a flood of words, oft sink Out of the common sight, like birds called divers, Than which you're more long-winded. Mend that fault!— You have been pondering o'er the theme, I see, And that was well. Draw up your thoughts upon it For my perusal, and in plain short terms; D'ye hear? Glanville. They shall be brief, my gracious liege! Enter De Bohun, Clare, and Leicester. Henry. Ha! whence come ye? Leicester. From the round church, my liege, Beside us here; where Becket was at mass. Henry. So! ye look grave: as if he being at prayers, Did more than merely recommend his soul To God and ours to Satan. Heard ye aught strange? De Bohun. Nought strange in such a darer, though 'twere monstrous In any other man! Henry. What was that, ha? Clare. Besides his affectation palpable Save to the mole-eyed people, of distress, Disaster'd state, rapt piety, resignment, Sanctified patience, sufferance supreme, By dress, air, act, long moan, loud sob, large tears,— He ordered as Introit to the service With blasphemous self-allusion—Princes sat And spake against me. Henry. O! he would set up As mark'd for martyrdom!—with that angel face Of his,—the Syrian blackmoor's son!—Himself Persecutor of his king! Leicester. He comes, my liege: His Meekness comes! Enter Becket, arrayed in purple and pall, with his Crosier elevated, and a proud retinue. Henry. Heyday! the Pope of Canterbury! Or Babylonian Lady all a-flame For hot contést!—What think ye, cousins, are we To have our heads broke with the pastoral Cross? Becket. I bear it for my sole protection! Henry. Ay! What dread'st thou? else than paying thy just debts To me and to the state? Dost need protection Against thy creditors, like a prodigal?— Glanville, that scroll!— [Reading. Item: three hundred pounds,— Which thou didst levy upon Eye and Berkham, Lately thy honours; Item; five hundred marks, I lent thee at Toulouse; Item, five hundred,— For which I stood thy surety to a Jew, Whom thou dealt'st much with, till thy credit broke, What time thou wallowedst in the wanton streams Of Luxury most dissolute; Besides An item, which to small rogues we set down Plain theft, but to thy Grace embezzlement,— Forty-four thousand marks, the balance due From rents, proceeds, and profits of all prelacies, Abbeys, and baronies, by thee administer'd When Chancellor. Item— Becket. My liege! my liege! my liege! Henry. Oh! I am then thy sovereign yet, it seems! Most affable subject, still to call me liege!— (To himself) I've snapt that nerve which keeps up most men's pride, The purse-string! Becket. I did never lack allegiance.— But for my lavishness as Chancellor, Call it more loose than his who lets the wealth Of Tagus' bed roll down by golden shoals Into the wasteful ocean,—'twas a thing Praised, as magnificence in the minister Which made for the more glory of the master, Whose humour now condemns it!—Was he, Sire, Who had been found a fraudful Chancellor Deem'd fit to be a Primate? Henry. 'Tis not what He had been deem'd, but what we 've proved him since. Becket. Crying injustice! able to bring down Those spheres in molten fragments on mankind, But that 'twould crush the guiltless with the guilty! Henry. Thank heaven we have one milk-white soul among us! Thou scarlet sinner!—Why—My gorge is swoln With names, not huge enough for thy vast insolence!— Tell me this—thou—who claim'st the Saintship next Vacant i' the Calendar,—this, Immaculate!— Thou didst subscribe in these law-guarded terms, ‘Legally, with good faith, and without fraud, Without reserve,’—to certain Constitutions, Which thou abjur'st now: does such perjury Merit no lapidation from the spheres If they did hurl their hissing firestones at us? Becket. There was no perjury! Henry. Hear this! hear this!— Sun-dwelling Truth, hast thou not one bright dart To strike him through the brain with?—Ye, grave Suffragans! [To the Bishops. Did your supreme here (give me your corporate voice) Swear to our Constitutions, yea or no? Bishops. Yea! Becket. Foolish children that would judge their father!— I kept to what I swore, those Constitutions, While they were such: but when a power beyond Thine to enact, annull'd them, how could I Observe non-entities? Henry. Fraud within fraud! In this same wise you may play fast and loose With any oath; may be, for aught I know, My very true, sworn subject, on proviso, Till you 're absolved by bull into a traitor! Becket. His Holiness can ne'er absolve, except To save or serve the Church— Henry. Yes, you may load The winds with loyal oaths, to place your heart Between mine and all stabbers, yet, even now, Bear in one sleeve a permit to kill kings, And in the other a poniard! Becket. My dear liege!— This is uncharitable. Henry. To serve the Church! To serve the Church, man!—Did the Romish altar Burn for thy sovereign, as a sacrifice, Thou 'rt bound to slaughter him!—O Thomas! Thomas! Could I e'er think that thou wouldst pierce the heart Of thy kind, loving, generous, royal master? Becket. Not generous now, to say I 'd pierce thy heart! Henry. Thou hast done so!—if not with knife or brand, With keen-cold weapon of ingratitude, More poignant still!—But 'tis no matter: go! There is a gulf as wide as heaven from hell Between us, across which 'tis vain to think Of ever shaking hands!—I am thy enemy, To thy perdition or my own! Becket. I know it, So would betake me into banishment, And save a sacrilege unto thy soul. Henry. Good man!—Thou wouldst betake thyself to Louis, To the French court, which breeds intriguants, Fast as Lutetian filth breeds vermin vile, Against my kingdom.—Twice thou hadst fled thither, But that the roaring winds, our rough allies, Forbade thy ship to fetch and carry treason! My very seas rose up, upon my side, Against thy steps!—Stay, and be baited here, Till thy proud dewlaps drop with sweat and foam!— As a first humblement, thy goods and chattels Be all confiscate for contempt of court And breach of fealty, in not attending Our summons, when John Mareschal appeal'd thee About the manour of Pageham— Becket. On that summons I, being sick, sent four good household knights To plead for me. Was this contempt? Was this Devoir left unperform'd?—Yea, when the cause Itself, was weigh'd at mine own spiritual Court In scales which might have dropp'd from Libra stars, As nice as Conscience trims with trembling hand— Henry. Ha! ha! Becket. Sir! Sir! 'tis truth; and he who here By royal subornation brings that cause, Would blush for it,—but before this grave Council, Like it iniquitous! [The Barons start up, and Becket's train advance. Becket raises his Crosier and Henry his Sceptre between them. Henry. These sacred wands, Not unanointed swords, decide the fray!— Archbishop, from thy last words, if no more, I see thou art a self-devoted man Unto destruction imminent!—Take your way. Winchester. My liege, accept two thousand marks from him, In lieu of all demands. Henry. I will not, Winchester! But thou another froward priest, de Blois, Whose mitre coped thy brother Stephen's crown, Shalt pronounce sentence for the full amount. [They retire some paces. Norwich (to Becket). My lord, beseech you on my knees, submit, Or you, the Church, and all of us are lost! Salisbury (to him). We cannot be thy sureties for such sum, Though for the less we might. York (to him). Take exhortation From one a Primate like thyself, and moved By most disinterested love,—resign Thy see, to gain full peace, release, and pardon. London (to him). 'Twas thou thyself who led'st us to subscribe The Constitutions, yet, when all too late, Wouldst have us now proclaim ourselves, with thee, Rebels to royal power, and renegades To our own oaths! Becket. Folliott, thou shalt be ever A stench i' the nostril of posterity!— Thou art corrupted, man!—Primate of York, This pall is much too weighty for thy shoulders!— Sarum, I always knew thee as a gryphon Keeping thy claw fast on thy hoarded gold!— Poor Norwich, thou art pitiful!—Ye Suffragans, [Turning to the other Bishops who implore him. Ay, who will suffer again, again, again, (Spare me the pertinent quibble!) all the ills That tyranny can heap on callous meanness,— Repose your deprecative arms! they 'll soon Have beggar's-work enough, when ye are turn'd By foes o' the Church, 'gainst whom ye raise no finger, To mendicant monks and almsmen!—Stay me not, I will go forward! York. There 's no stopping some men Upon their course down the steep fall of Ruin! Becket. 'Tis plain, Sir King!—lord of these lower skies! Where you point all your thunder-bolts. But let them Break first on this bare head, as yon poor image Placed shelterless aloft that pinnacle Bears with mild brow the elemental brunt To shield his fane beneath!—Thou hast resolved I know, thy throne shall rise above all height Upon the ruins of the downcast Church, Thy Babel-towering throne, from which shall come Confusion o'er the land!—Have then thy will! On this offensive mount, flourish a time, Perish eternally! Henry. At thy behest? Becket. There is a throne, compared to earthly ones, Higher than heaven above the hills: dread thence Thunderings, which shall shake thy throne to dust, And bury thyself beneath it, and thy barons Send down with blasted fronts, to be the spurn Of devils less degraded towards their king! Henry. All this, because I summon a state-debtor, Punish a peculator, and attach The goods of a respectless feudatory— By Mahound, that 's strange doctrine! Becket. Mere pretences To crush the Church in me!—I do appeal 'Gainst all your sentences and penalties Unto the Pope; and henceforth do commit To his safeguard, myself and my whole See! Barons. High-treason, an appeal to Rome! Becket. High-traitor, I then!—too high for ye to touch!—though graspers For whom the sacristy holds no sacred things!— Nay, scowl on others, king!—it daunts not me!— Thou—thou shouldst rather quail beneath my frown!— Thy sword may kill the body, but this staff, Sword of the Militant Church, which I do wield, Can kill the soul! Henry. Pronounce his sentence straight! He is deprived of all his lands and holdings! Becket. I will not drink pollution through mine ears! Breathe it not, Winchester! till I am gone, Lest it scorch up thy lips to whitest ashes! Henry. Hear how the wolf can howl! Becket. Since impious men Whom strength makes wrongful, wrongfulness makes strong, Plunder-swoln, gross with produce of all crime, Band them against the battlements of heaven On earth, to wit the bulwarks of the Church— Henry. He means his turreted Elysium At Saltwood-park,—to touch which we are Titans! Becket. And have decreed its sole defender here, Me!—me!—most violently trampled down— Their mounting-step to that assault sacrilegious,— Henry. Why thou wert far above our reach but now? Becket. Since prayer, plaint, rhetoric's mingled honey and gall, Cannot withhold them from the fathomless pit Gaping beneath their steps,—if they must follow Satan's dark inspirations to such deeds, Flagitious, dreadless, godless—which mute heaven Permits, but weeps at—good men's mazement, The angels' horror— Henry. Wipe from thy blest mouth That surge of foam! Becket. Since then, Perverse! thou seem'st Desperate on self and state destruction both, What more but this can parting Becket say,— Thine and Hell's will be done! [Exit. Henry. The wolf 's dog-mad! [Scene closes. SCENE III. A Street in Northampton. After some time, enter John of Oxford. John of O. How still and dead-struck seems the air, which late Was but one maddening whirl! The pause itself More fearful yet! 'Tis like that breathlessness On some blank heath, when rival storms retire Quick from their lightning-blasted battle-field, And leave the waste more wild! They but recoil To gasp, and 'gin their mighty rack again, Distract the fugitive tribes and darken Nature!— O these are ominous, gloomy times!—Proud Becket Bears into banishment a heart more fell Than tiger's towards his victim ere he spring: Henry (no lamb before him!) spurs to London, Like the Red Spirit northern Skalds describe Breathing pure flame, his very flesh a-glow, And fiercer blazing the more fast he flies!— However lamely, I must follow him; There will be need of me at Sens to smoothe These differences with a polish'd tongue And urge with subtle one the royal pleas; For Harry, stout and little superstitious As is his mood, loved fondly by his commons And dreadingly by his nobles, yet hath fears Political; he will woo the Pontiff more To quit his holy pout at these late doings, Than he would Pope Joan for her dearest favours. So John of Oxford haste to make his peace As Sens's papal court, and also there Make your own English fortune, if you may. [Exit. SCENE IV. An Inn and Smithy by the roadside. De Morville, Brito, and De Traci. Brito. Sir William, we must leave you: the time hastes. De Morville. Almost as quickly as the king, whose steed Seems to have feather'd hoofs, like one of old Our scholars prate of. De Traci. Had mine but plain shoes He 'd make the wind a laggard!—Leave me not Good Gentlemen!—I 'll with you straight.—Stir! stir! [To the Blacksmith. Thou sledge-arm'd slug! De Morville. Well the Archbishop stood Toughly up to 't: I almost honour him. Brito. Didst thou remark his spirit how it rose, As sinewy brawn doth on a boxer's arm, Elastic, after every blow? De Morville. Well! well! De Traci. Had he but kept his temper to the last? De Morville. Turbulence is the nature of a priest, And while he rein'd it, 'twas as rocks upon A burning mountain's mouth, which close it only Till vent be found, and then they 're spit at heaven. Brito. Nothing will e'er bring down his haughty front But what brings down a bull's—the blow of a pole-axe! De Morville. He'll get a tap from that same filliper, Will make him stagger. De Traci. Shall we have war? De Morville. Most like: A civil one—no more! De Traci. Pardon! what means Un-civil war? I never for my part, In fight, slay any man but civilly; With compliments I deal him coup-de-grâce, Nothing less courteous will he get from me! I'm no ox-leveller like Sir Richard here. Mortbleu! what is a battle but a tilt Without its mockery? To Mars's lists I, at the tongueless summons of the trump, Come, as at love-call to my ladye's bower, Gallant, and debonair, heartwarm, and trim, In gentil hauberk, glistening helm, and arms, But to disport me at the play of lives With ill intent to no man! 'Tis most churlish To fight for hate, and pash a stranger's head Because he's stout; live he on if he may, After I let the light through him! who cares? My devoir has been done!—Saint Gris, my horse! [Going to the Smithy. Brito. Shoe him with quicksilver, good Smith! De Morville. Brave damosel! I 've seen him kiss his hand to a gallant plume Before he strook it, dyed with sanguine, off,— Then cut a capricole! Brito. Mine ancestors, 'Tis said, were taught to dance among the points Of sharpest swords and spears, for pastime; he Seems to do so by nature!—How he skips About the Smith, like gnat about a horse Before it fixes! De Morville. Come!—What! ostler there!— We will not stay. Boy! bring our horses out.— Enter Boy. Boy. Horses, sir? there's not a four-legged beast in the stable but the ass and John Ostler. De Morville. What is 't thou say'st? Innkeeper! scoundrel! thief! horse-stealer! Enter Innkeeper. Innkeeper. Sir Knight, I pray you— De Morville. None of your prayers, Infidel! Fetch me my horse in a trice, or I 'll cut off thy head, and nail it up over thine own door for a Saracen's! Innkeeper. Why, Sir, your horses have been just led out the back way. Brito. By whom, knave? Innkeeper. By two servants at command of my lord the Archbishop, who said he would explain all to your worships. De Morville. Here 's pretty doings! Brito. By St. Edward, this passes! De Morville. Which way are they gone? Innkeeper. Round about, sir; but his Grace is here. [Exit. Enter Becket, Gryme, and Bosham. Becket. You took, my menials tell me, certain horses Out of mine inn to-day; was it not so? [To Gryme. Gryme. Two sorrels and a black. De Morville. They were our own. Becket. They were of twenty sent me yesternight, As present from the King: I cannot lose them! Brito. Sir Primate, they are ours, and we will have them! Becket. When you shall prove them yours, as it may be, By words of better credence than your own; Till then I know not who has right to come Rifle my mansion, and call what he steals No thievery. De Morville. ‘Thievery!’—the king's gentlemen Thieves? Becket. No! by no means! if indeed ye be The gentlemen ye call yourselves; but I Cannot yet guess ye such, whilst ye seem felons. De Morville. What! have we stolen out of your remembrance, My lord Archbishop?—You did know us once. Becket. I have, methinks, seen visages like yours In the King's shadow, darkly, times ago; But I am oft oblivious of such things, My memory being throng'd with better.—Pray you, Go from me now. De Morville. De Morville is a baron, Proud prelate!—Lord of Knaresborough Castle, I! Becket. A lesser baron—it may be, perchance— Brito. The Britos were born sovereigns, when the Beckets Were but their slaves and villeins. Becket. Bosham, my book: I'll read a prayer or two, whilst the mules bait. [He begins to read while the Knights threaten him. Bosham. Will't please your grace retire into the house, Or shall I call your knights? Becket. Who needs defence? England's most sacred head?—go to! go to! De Traci (returning). Allons, mes enfans! See you how my steed Pants hotter than the bellows, now he's shod: Allons. [Gryme whispers Becket, pointing to the forge. Becket. Ha!—that's another of the twenty! Bosham, go tell a groom to seize that horse For the Archbishop's use. [Exit Bosham. De Traci. Diable! my horse? Becket. Gryme, set these cavaliers aright upon This trivial matter. [Walks apart reading. Gryme. Sirs, if you 'll examine These chargers; underneath their housings rich, You 'll find them branded with the letter B And a large crook crossed: this is for archbishop, That is for Becket: you 've but to examine, And be full satisfied. De Traci. What tell you me Of B's and crooks and Beckets?—He shall have My steed by neither crook nor hook— Becket. You are loud: It is irreverent in this presence. Are ye Of the King's body-guard, I can but say The master's conduct shows it in the men Most coarsely mimick'd.—Ye shall have no steeds, So follow him to London as ye can. De Traci. Yield we thus, friend? [To De Morville. De Morville. What say you, Brito? Brito. I?— Even what you say! De Morville. Though I'm no church-goer, There is an awe hangs round this priest: I cannot Draw anything sharper on him than my tongue. (To Becket) Granted these beasts were of your household, Sir, They 've been attach'd to-day with all your goods. Becket. Does that give you a right to nym them, friend? It more behoves me guard what I must soon Surrender to the Sheriff, or be deem'd A petty-traitor. Meantime they will serve To bear me on the road to Canterbury; My servants want good steeds. De Morville. O that thou hadst not This sacred stole upon thee— Becket. That I have it Is well for ye!—or my good sword had sent Your souls a-horseback on the current winds To serve the king of darkness!—Speak once more, I will dismiss them to eternal pain Even with this naked arm. Begone!—or stay Accursed for ever! [They withdraw intimidated. Now they have given ground, I will retire. Go you before me, Richard! [Exit with Gryme. The Knights come forward. De Morville. 'T was all in vain; I could not meet his eye! De Traci. Pardie, his lance-point were the easier parried! Brito. You 'd have found even that no knitting-needle In an old nurse's hand.—Mars was his sponsor; He had his first meat put into his mouth Upon a sword's point; that was his spoon-feeding! De Traci. He has affray'd us, three puissant knights, By his mere growl, as a grim mastiff would A leash of greyhounds. De Morville. Let us bide our time!— Come, we must e'en creep forward if we may On any churl's old dobbins we can seize. Brito. Be the priest hang'd as high as his own pride! De Morville. And without benefit of clergy!—Come. De Traci. I'll make that whisperer, Gryme, cry out at least One day or other!—Allons, mes amis! [Exeunt. SCENE V. An Alley in the Labyrinth. Enter John of Salisbury, with a book. John of S. “Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida sylvas.”— Let me pause here, both tongue and foot. Such melody Of words doth strike the wild-birds mute to hear it! Honey-lipp'd Virgil, 'tis an ignorant truth To name thee—Sorcerer; for thou dost indeed Enchant by happiest art!—Here is a place To meditate thy sylvan music in, Which seems the very echo of these woods, As if some Dryad taught thee to resound it. O gentle breeze, what lyrist of the air Tunes her soft chord with visionary hand To make thy voice so dulcet? O ye boughs Whispering with numerous lips your kisses close, How sweet ye mingle secret words and sighs! Doth not this nook grow warmer with the hum Of fervent bees, blithe murmurers at their toil, Minstrels most bland? Here the dim cushat, perch'd Within his pendulous arbour, plaintive woos With restless love-call his ne'er-distant mate; While changeful choirs do flit from tree to tree, All various in their notes, yet chiming all Involuntary, like the songs of cherubim. O how by accident, apt as art, drops in Each tone to make the whole harmonical, And when need were, thousands of wandering sounds Though aimless would, with exquisite error sure, Fill up the diapason!—Pleasant din! So fine that even the cricket can be heard Soft-fluttering through the grass. Long have I mark'd The silver toll of a clear-dropping well Peal in its light parishioners, ouphes and elves: 'Tis nigh me, certes?—I will peer between These honeysuckles, for it.—Lo! in verity A Sylph, with veil-fall'n hair down to her feet, Bending her o'er the waters, and I think Giving them purer crystal from her eyes— O learned John, but thou art grown fantastic As a Romancer! thou art quite bedream'd, A sleep-walker even in the breadth of day, That err'st with wide eyes!—Hark!— [A lute is heard. O me! O me! It is the Lady Rosamond herself, Nymphlike beside her Well!—She sent long since For me, her youth's dear tutor, to have given her Lessons of Delphic lore she ever loved, And now, methinks, the better that she's sad. I should be out of all good grace with her! [Exit. Scene changes to Rosamond's Well. Rosamond (singing to her lute). Listen, lords and ladies all, O listen to my lay! And I will sing the fate and fall Of a gentle Ladye gay! Enter John of Salisbury. John of S. Pardon thy ancient master, fairest Pupil! They left me wandering in this wilderness, Where I did lose myself; yea, deeper still I' the labyrinth of meditation wild And maze of fancy, wherein whoso gets, Heaven help him! he is self-inextricable. Rosamond. Pardon? O give me yours—I am most lost! John of S. Sad in Elysium, lady? Rosamond. Ay, forsooth! John of S. That's discontentful. Rosamond. Thou didst tell me once,— It was thy earliest and thy latest lesson, (O that I ne'er had conn'd it, or had kept it!)— ‘Be satisfied of thyself, that's the first thing, Contentment will come after with all else.’ John of S. And yet thy merit, less of form and face, Though these be Wonder's gaze— Rosamond. Yes, I am fair, Outside! John of S. Less than thy bosom'd ones, have raised thee To the throne's highest step. Rosamond. Unto the lowest Before Humiliation's shrine, have brought me! There lies she bleeding tears deplorable, Whom the world calls most happy! Should she be so? John of S. I can but say what I have ever found thee: Filial to very piety; a mistress Serving thy servants more than they could thee; Unto the poor a virtual Charity, A comfortable Pity to the sad; Docile with me and duteous as a daughter, Than which I more have loved thee, and must still; A pleader for the people to their king, Who dost allure with beauteous wile the sword Of Vengeance from his hand, and there insinuate The sword of Mercy for it! O whatever Thy faults, Fair Rosamond, to latest time Thou shalt be loved in England! Rosamond. Quite deserveless!— Yet 'twas my father's counsel and command, If not those of my conscience. Come, good master! Since thou hast cheer'd me with thy praise, and hope At least of man's forgiveness,—read me, I pray you, Some lines that teach submission and content From thy belovèd book. John of S. If it please you, Most gentle mistress, you shall read, while I Look o'er the page. Rosamond. Well, I will English it Precisely as I can, and you 'll correct me. What is it? John of S. Virgil's pastoral address To the old Shepherd. Rosamond. “Fortunate senex.” How!—let me see—it would go somewhat thus: ‘Happy Old Man!—here mid thy well-known streams And sacred founts, shalt thou the umbrageous cool Inhale! This neighbour hedge of willow flowers Still pasturing Hyblæan bees, shall oft With their light murmur lure thee to repose! Here shall the woodman sing unto the winds Beneath the lofty rock; nor shall thy care The deep-voiced doves, nor shall the turtle cease From the aërial elm-tree to complain.’— How poor my English sounds! John of S. Nay, it comes well So musically tongued: and faithful too. Rosamond. No! no! its excellence is unreachable Even by skill less schoolgirl-like than mine. That of the doves, “Raucæ, tua cura, palumbes—” How hoarsely-sweet! just as they murmur now! John of S. Doth it not breathe a sweetness o'er thy mind, Restful content and placid joy, this picture Of the old happy swain? Rosamond. Happy he was, For he was innocent! But peace without Doth not give peace within; it must be felt Here first, or the other is not seen. O would My breast and I were friends! O that I were At peace even in the grave— [A clarion sounds. Henry! [Exit. John of S. The king!— There flies she to her bower, wing'd by love, Straight, low, and swift, like blackbird to its nest! How soon love's soft alarum silenced, too, Conscience, the wren, which but in stillness cheeps! Well, if a lover, handsome, young, and brave, Courteous and generous, a prince of princes, Wise, witty, learned, skilful in all arts To do, or undo, what and whom he wills, Sparing nor pains, nor promises, nor pacts, Nor power itself, to triumph—were excuse For helpless woman erring, 'tis my pupil's. Many a one with not the tithe so much To warp her way, goes tenfold wider wrong; Yea, scouts the dallyer by Virtue's path, Whilst she herself is on the slide to sin. I have remark'd it, and will set it down In my court-commonplaces, for my book. Now let me find mine own right way, if possible. What, Gabel, are you there?—Come hither, friend Enter Gabel. Gabel. O sir, I was looking for a stray sheep,—a black one,sir—or rather iron-brown, the colour of your cloak, sir: have you seen it? John of S. Not I. Gabel. It did not come here to the well, sir, with you? John of S. I never looked. Gabel. Ah! he did not look at the water, or he'd have seen the sheep there I was in search of!—Come, sir, I'll guide you to the pen. John of S. “Rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes.” Gabel. How prettily he bleats! Come, sir, you must not stand, like a new-yeaned lamb, whose legs are too long for walking. John of S. Come on, good Gabel!—though I had rather stay—“Flumina amem, sylvasque inglorius!” Gabel. He's a born idiot! I shall have as much ado to drive him forward, grunting Latin with his nose to the ground, as a hog in canonicals! [Exeunt. Scene changes to an Alcove. Henry and the Earl of Cornwall. Henry. So, he is fled, uncle? Cornwall. Coastward, as they tell me. Henry. To France. Some storm embargo him once more! I could forgive those seabord thieves, called wreckers, Who pounce like cormorants on half-drown'd men, If they would now make prey of my Archbishop: The law I threat against them shall not pass Till we have heard his fate. Well, we'll sequester, At least, his revenues of Canterbury, And let this high-flyer on ether live, Like bird of Paradise, as he is! Cornwall. He hath Many relations, friends, domestics, here Who eat no other's bread; they'll not have husks, Now he has left them almsless. Henry. Banish all to him! So, hanging on his emptiness, they'll help To bring his haughty stomach down. Ay, banish them! 'Tis a good thought: I thank thee for it, uncle. Cornwall. Nay, the whole credit of it is your majesty's! Enter an Attendant. Attendant. My liege, the Lady Rosamond awaits Your presence or your pleasure in the bower. Henry. Say we attend on hers. [Exit Attendant. Clouds, from my front! Now be my face the mirror of the sun, No heart like mine glows in his ardorous breast! Away all storms for one sweet summer eve, Away all cares but those of love alone! [Returning.] Uncle! You'll mention not this banishment Of Becket's household, to the Lady Rose, Else will she bend the strength of all her tears To shake my purpose. You conceive? [Exit. Cornwall. Most well!— Stern with the stubborn, tender with the mild, Fiercest in battle-field, gentlest in bower, Heart rough of rind, but melting soft at core, That's the right chivalrous spirit! Now he'll woo As if he, aye, sigh'd at a lady's feet, And never stretch'd a dragon at his own! Come! I have stay'd the length of twenty kisses, Each a breath long; 'tis proper to walk in. [Exit. Scene changes to Rosamond's Bower. Henry and Rosamond. Rosamond. You must have ta'en a bird's flight from so far. Henry. No coming rainbow spans the sky so swift, As I cross'd hither. Rosamond. Nor so swift again Vanishes!—Ah, thou truant! Henry. Faithfuller Than ray-crown'd Lucifer is to the dawn, Or Hesperus to eve! Enter Cornwall. Rosamond. You are indeed My star! the ruler of my horoscope! On whose bright circlet, loftiest in the spheres, Depend my weal and woe! Henry. Doubt it not, sweet! Uncle of Cornwall, will you scold your niece (That is to be), for her sad-heartedness? I cannot. Cornwall. Fairest niece, you are to blame— Henry. Come, that 's enough! She smiles, which is a sign You 've touch'd her deeply, and she will amend. How likes my Lady the new cast of hawks I sent her—do they fly? Rosamond. They soar!—yet come Down again to my wrist as straight as larks, Whene'er I call them. Henry. That's because the lure Is dazzling white, and sparkles in their eye; This lily wrist, I mean. Rosamond. Ah, flatterer!— And the two greyhounds are a brace of spirits In canine form; they course the fields as light As gossamer, yet strong their slender limbs As bows of springiest yew. 'Tis beautiful To see them toss themselves like bounding hoops About you, with such gentle tamelessness Which knows not how to still itself, and mocks The hand that would caress them into quiet! They are a pair of Graces in their kind! Henry. Well, we will go a-falconing to-morrow, And run them quiet. How is your white palfrey, Fleet Solyman, whom we got o'er from Spain? Rosamond. Then you will stay with me—all—all to-morrow? 'Tis but one, single day. O recreant knight, That will refuse a lady! Henry. I must to Caen, For England's good: and thy true patriot heart Hath even more pride in me as her Champion Than as thy own! Yet I shall, peradventure, Cheat her of some few hours. Rosamond. Not one for Rosamond! Serve England, that 's thyself; thyself; that's me.— Well, I 've another favour you must grant. Henry. Uncle, what covetous creatures women are! If not this, why then that! but something ever. Cornwall. Nay, it is true! 'tis true!—the King says true. Rosamond. In faith I will not be a loving niece If you take part against me thus, my lord. 'Tis for poor master John of Salisbury, My good, kind Tutor! Henry. He 's a friend of one, Rank foe of mine: let him still follow Becket, Who 'll make provision for him. Cornwall (aside). Such as will not Lie heavy on his stomach! Rosamond. Now you are cold, And cold to me! Henry. Well, sweet! we will translate him. Cornwall (aside). To some French benefice, with a rich glebe-field Of water-cresses, where he may take in kind His tithe-frog if he will! Rosamond. Well? Have you thought? Bishop of what? Henry. Take your arms from about me; It is a kind of main force—a sheer laying Of violent hands upon me—is it not, uncle? Cornwall. Assault and desperate seizure, I am witness! Rosamond. Then I will hang here, where it was committed! Henry. O thou—thou twining, clasping, tendril thing, That to my proud top creep'st thy flexible way, And makest it bend to thee! Have what thou wilt: John shall be our next Bishop. Rosamond. I will call him: He should be in the cabinet.—Master John! [Going to the door. His Highness. Come! Enter John of Salisbury. Henry. So, master John!—We'd make you A bishop, master John! at your and our Sweet Lady's suit. John of S. Beholden ever To dear and fair my Scholar! Pace tuá! (Somewhat be-mazed yet!), I would have said, My gracious Mistress. Henry. Hark'ee: you 're my Bishop, Not Becket's, who and his chief partisans Are banished. John of S. Then I'm still plain master John: Yea, and an exile too! Cornwall. Art a fool also? Wilt give up for an outcast, a vile lack-penny, A high-road starver,—hope, and home, and king? John of S. Never my king, but not more soon my friend. Henry (aside). He 's steadfast—that's a man to gain. I'll think of him. Rosamond. Dear Master!—dearest Liege! John of S. Sire, thy true subject. [Exit. Henry (to Rosamond). You see 'twas not my fault: but be at ease. [They converse apart. Cornwall. Were ever dunces like your deep-read men! Lunatics like your poets! There he walks Leisurely as an ass, though March-hare mad, Away from Fortune, having spurn'd her wheel! Scholars, forsooth, and heaven-born Bards!—Sheer idiots! That shade themselves from every shower of gold Thinking it meant to crush them; or if not, Scorn even to pick it up! 'Tis as good calling Sea-gulls to dovecotes, as them to warm cribs; Both feed upon the estrays of the elements, Famine's allowance; when they might grow fat Merely by opening mouth at rich men's tables. Let them go hang like bats in caves together, I'll pet such purblind flitter-mice no more! Henry (to Rosamond). John shall be cared for, though he flies from me. Believe it, dearest! Becket's venom lies At root of all this rebel faith I reap; 'Tis he corrupts my vassals—he!—he!—he! Rosamond. Nay but, my sovereign love, think how most apt All are to deem the wronger knows he wrongs, And thence our bitterest quarrels: Becket may Do wrong more ignorantly than malignantly. Henry. Malignantly, say I! and that admitted, As ignorantly as you please. Ah! thou 'rt too clement: A beauty in your sex, in ours a blemish. Rosamond. I am not all so peccantless myself! Henry. O thou 'rt a sad one! I do think thou wouldst— No, I'll not say it! Rosamond. Tell me it! I will know it! Tell me the whole, whole ill thou think'st of me! Henry. Come hither to my arms, and then I'll tell thee.— I think thou wouldst defend the Devil himself If I accused him harshly! Rosamond. No, in sooth! But—save to me—bytimes I mark o'ermuch Of thy great stock, the stern first William, in thee; And fear, when chafed, that thou mayst work thyself As well as others woe. None are, perchance, For all the blotch'd or beauteous mask they wear, So virtueless as they seem, no more than viceless. Henry. Well, you shall give the discipline yourself To penitent Becket when he bares his shoulders; You shall your scourge of feathers, and your besom Of flowers, lay on him sharply! Come! forget him. Let us forth to the river. I had vow'd These hours to pleasure only, love, and thee! Rosamond. The barge hath all her rainbow streamers out, You can behold them wavering in the breeze, There, through the trellis. Henry. And we'll take with us Provençal Arnault with a minstrel band To kindle glee amongst the squires and damsels: Come, we will feast the winds with melody! Through the enchanted air, along the flood We 'll pour a stream of music as we row, That shall lead captive every god o' the wave, And thou shalt be chief Syren!—Uncle, come! [Exeunt. Scene changes to a Lawn in the Labyrinth. Enter John of Salisbury. John of S. Farewell, sweet Woodstock bowers! blissful shades, Through whose dim walks, so pleasantly perplext, Oft have I wander'd, shadow-like myself! Where with the finer spirits of the place Communing, I have felt the bonds of earth Fall gradual from about me, and it seem'd Leave me at length mere soul, that purest state Which man's last hope aspires! Farewell, ye lawns, Ye silent meadows green, whose golden flowers Breathe up rich vapour as floats o'er the fields Of sun-fed asphodel. Ye willowy streams, By whose wild banks my thoughts and I have stray'd; Ye verdurous alleys, down whose tuftless sward My foot has met no mossy obstacle To wake me from my dream, while brow to book, I walk'd oblivious of all else, yea letting The insensible hours steal from me,—fare ye well! I must no longer see thee, Woodstock! haply Never again! nor even my native shores! “Nos patriæ fines et dulcia linquimus arva.” Alas, what difference sees the selfsame day, Or moment, in the fates of different men! Lo! for proof present, where from happy bower, Throng down that jocund crowd unto the barge Buoyant herself,light dancing on the wave, Spreading her broad skirts to each errant wind And flaunting her gay ribbons as a lure For every amorous Zephyr. There they crowd, Minstrels and all, each voice and instrument, Their very laughter, shouts of firm command, And cries of haste, and feignèd shrieks of fear At the unstable element,—all tuned To one high note of joy: like manor swans, Bright wantons of the water, every islet Is still their home; they sail from home to home, And turn at eve, tired with their plashy play, Unto that home's dear homestead, their green nest. But dolorous John must far away to France, With none save Poverty for his guide, and Scorn For his close follower! Well ! 'tis Heaven's will, And I submit mine. Farewell, Lady Rose, My pupil and my anxious patroness! Would that I were even sure of seeing thee Once more, wherever!—Vale, vale, inquit Johannes! [Exit. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Queen's Cabinet at Windsor. Enter Eleanor with a letter. Eleanor. What says our correspondent, the Archbishop? This patch'd-up truce between the King and him Which has allow'd his late return to England, And re-instatement in full power and pride, Leaves them as bitter enemies as before. Either would juggle, or jugulate the other, Could he do so with safeness. But let's see. (Reading). “Sovereign Madam, In answer to your Highness's letter touching a certain Dædalean work of my careless days, to wit the Labyrinth called of Woodstock, accept this: I can be an open antagonist to a king, but a secret one to no man; neither can petty intrigues of the royal bower concern the Primate of all England. Nevertheless, “Your Highness's well-wisher, “Thomas Canterbury.” —Thomas Canterbury, what a Saint you are! Pride makes him traitor on a large scale, yet keeps him true to his little allegiance! But for his pride alone, he would love to pinch the King's heart by this corner just as much as I do. —Now, what's to be done? If the dwarf comes back like others from their voyage of discovery, with the skin of an unknown weasel, and an extraordinary cockle-shell found on the coast, my own brain must work. Rather than lose the occasion, now Henry's abroad, I'll sack Woodstock itself, even if my Regent son will not wink at it; and I am sowing a little rebellion-seed in his mind against his to me disloyal father. Yes, Eleanor will risk imprisonment for the rest of her life, but this “Dædalean work” of our Archbishop shall lay open itself and its monster. What! baffle the Queen's Majesty! [Exit. SCENE II. A Coppice in the Labyrinth. Prince Richard and a Henchman, who trims him a club. Richard. Leave the knobs on't: I'll not have one o' them Smoothed off thus! Henchman. But your graciousness— Richard. Give't to me! And the bill-hook too. Now, go you find the dog. Henchman. Your grace will promise me not to stray farther From Woodstock bounds? I shall be whipt and hang'd If we are caught here in the Labyrinth, Albeit but o'er the hedge. Richard. No, I'll not stir; There is my knightly word. Henchman (going). He will not break it, Unruly little lurdane as he is! [Exit. Enter Rosamond. Rosamond. Who may this stalworth boy, with curls of gold Clustering adown his shoulders, be?—Thy name? Richard. Plantagenet! Rosamond. What dost here, royal child? Richard. You are a sweet-voiced country lass, and so I'll answer you. See you not what I do? Shape me a mall to brain the Saracens. Rosamond. But wherefore venture hither, when thou know'st 'Tis strict forbid? Richard. Why that's the cause I do't! What bravery else in't? When my mother Nell Says, ‘Richard, 'ware that blood-hound!’ Straight I grip him Fast by the sullen muzzle till he grins, Then give him a box i' the chaps to make him growl Like thunder: ha! ha! ha! Then she so shakes me, and I roar with laughter! (Turning, and seeing Rosamond). O!—O!—O!— You are Fair Rosamond, I'll bet a kingdom! Rosamond. How know you that, brave sir? Richard. Because—because You have the sweetest lips—O now I see What made you speak so sweetly to me here! You cannot help it! Rosamond. You are gallant, young sir! Richard. And should not every Chevalier be that? Tell me—are you a Maid of Honour? Rosamond. Alas!— (Aside. How every quibble starts me!)—No, my lord. Richard. I'm sure you should be!—One so handsome ought To be most honourable! Rosamond. O how I blush Before this little lecturer!—When youth Can lesson years, 'tis sin's timidity Cowed by strong innocence. Richard. Perhaps you are not Old enough for my mother's taste in Maidens? Rosamond. I'm old enough, sweet boy, to have a son Almost thy twin. Richard. Nay, you're too slim to have Such a great boy as me!—Hey, here's a bevy! Enter Damsels running. 1st Damsel. O madam! madam! madam! save yourself! There's such a monster coming after us! Rosamond. What is it? 1st Damsel. We cannot tell! The many faces It grinned at us, made us hide ours, and flee! 2nd Damsel. 'Tis like a she-baboon, but uglier! 3rd Damsel. Fangs Like horns, and fiery eyes, and claws to boot Like a dwarf ogre! Richard. 'Tis a Saracen! Everything grim and odious is a Saracen! Damsels. It comes! it comes! jolting along the sward Its hunch'd deformity on unequal legs, Mowing and muttering!—Fly! fly!— [The Damsels fly. Richard (setting himself before Rosamond). Fear you not, I'll be your Champion! Rosamond. Boy, mad boy, come with us! Richard. Hold me not, Lady!—See how I'll make this Saracen One mummy with my mall! Enter Dwerga, horribly disguised, opposite to her the Henchman. Henchman (seeing Dwerga). The fiend! the fiend! [Runs away. Richard (rushing upon the Dwarf). Gog!—Magog!—Mahound!—Tyrmagaunt!— [Dwerga, with doleful screams and yells, is driven off by Richard. Rosamond. O true son Of my own knightliest hero!—Hark his shouts! Anger, triumphant glee, and glorious laughter, To mix in combat with a very demon! Save him, O good St. George! thou patron saint Of England's chivalry, save this gallant child! Wretched suspense!—end! end!—O my young Champion! Re-enter Richard. Art safe? not wounded? hast thou lost no blood?— Richard. No—but I've lost my breath!—What leathern fells Those Infidels have! There is no piercing them! Re-enter Damsels and Henchman. (To the Henchman.) Was I not right to have the knobs left on? Runagate! Henchman. Sweetest prince, let us away! Richard. Go hang!—Come, lady, now my guerdon of you! Rosamond. To my young saviour-knight, what can I give? Richard. Why, don't you know? do ye not know the rules? You are to take me home, and feast me there With spiced wines, confects, and sweetmeats rich, In a grand lustrous Hall, where you and I Sit under a fine canopy; and, at last— No, both at first and last, you are to give me, With modesty all maiden and demure, A sweet, sweet kiss— Rosamond. My warmest one—(kisses him.) Where read you Of all these gallantries? Richard. Read?—plague on reading! One may learn gallantry without book, I hope! Henchman. His brain is stuff'd with tales of old Sir Guy, Rolands, Round Tables, Tournies, and Twelve Peers, Dragons, and Saracens, which his ear picks up From Minstrels loose, that haunt the royal halls, And our romancing sempstresses. Richard. Thou liest, [Striking him. Base-hearted peasant!—Call them so again, I'll bang thee like the other unbeliever Into the slough there, and leave both of ye To choke i' the mire together! Madam, come! Rosamond. O he's the very promise of his father! Whene'er he speaks to woman, his broad brow, Which noble ire contracts and knots betimes, Spreads to a radiant smoothness,—Shall I call you Herculean Cupid, for thy beauteous strength, Or, for thy generous courage, Cœur-de-Lion? Richard. I know not Cupid. I'll be Cœur-de-Lion! Rosamond. Thou shalt then!—Come!—His father's cheek will glow With pride, to hear of Rosamond's protector.— Come on, Prince Richard Cœur-de-Lion! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Street in Southwark. De Eynsford, John of Oxford, Walter Mapes, De Broke. De Eynsford. We are nicely pacified, are we not, now the king has sent home this belligerent Archbishop with the kiss of peace,—to pass it round among us? John of O. Yes? have you ever heard the story of the Bear in the Boat? Methought our vessel rehearsed it: here sat the Primate i' the middle, clad even over the ears with his shaggy ermine, spreading his loose bulk from gunwale to gunwale, growling to himself, and snuffing for prey, whilst all the humanity aboard skulked out of his sight to the scuttle-holes. I who had been made bear-leader, shrank into a most distant follower of his movements: now he had got the ring out of his nose, a squeeze from him was strangulation and a snap demolition. Mapes. He would at least have taken such a mouthful out of you as the Dragon does out of the full-moon—brought your plenitude to the wane—reduced your rotundity to the shape of a sickle!—Why, but now I went to pay him my humble devoirs, and his complaisance received me with a smile like a shark's, as if he would gladly have swallowed me wholesale. De Broke. What are offenders so weak as I to look for, when my lord Primate of York has been suspended, and the two Bishops excommunicated with many others? De Eynsford. Unless their journey to Rouen plead both their own cause and ours with success, our penitential knees will have to wear out the Black Mountain in Palestine. He is vindictive as a bloodhound! John of O. Be of good hope: they have the King's whole heart already, and need only a little of his ear. This late coming together at Fretville between him and Becket was about as cordial as that between the porcupine and the serpent: they may both have agreed to live crony-like together, but irascible readiness to bristle in the one, and most swelling venom in the other, will soon make them ill bosom-companions. Mapes. Methought that kiss of peace the King gave him was not quite so warm as he would have given the Lady Rose. I was just beside his majesty, and he turned him about after it as if he could have spat it on the floor. John of O. Yet he stooped with most gracious condescension from his horse, to hold the haughty Prelate's stirrup for him. De Eynsford. Yea, that was stooping indeed! not from his horse alone, but his state of honour. I had rather have taken hold of Becket's toe, and tumbled him over his palfrey! Mapes. Sir Bevis of Southampton on his proud war-horse Arundel, never looked such a self-promising, prodigious deed-doer as Becket on his little ambler. De Broke. Well, and if so, how much more must it exalt him in his own conceit, this besotted adulation of him by the people on his progress to visit the young king? Woodstock palace will not have a room high enough for his haughtiness! De Eynsford. Hear you how the base-born churls and citizens applaud him! Howling beasts! [Shouts within. Mapes. Will you go look at them? De Eynsford. Who, I? rather at the infidel dogs fawning and yelping hymns before Mahound! [Exit. John of O. It behoves me to have an eye on the prelate. Mapes. And me to have both mine on the people, for it is the more curious nondescript of the two. [Exit with John of Oxford. De Broke. If I can only keep my spoils from his See by it, I'll consent to be the last bob of the many-headed monster's tail! Let me join. [Exit. SCENE IV. Before Lambeth Palace. Becket, Bosham, and several Monks; Clare, De Lucy, and some Knights. A crowd of the lower order welcoming the Archbishop, who scatters a largesse. 1st Mob. Welcome to his Grace, and ill go with them that wish it not! Welcome our fellow-citizen, mighty and worthy, home from France! 2nd Mob. Largesse! largesse! Cry out more welcomes— More welcomes and more largesse! 1st Mob. Welcome! welcome home the father of the poor! Welcome the 'fender of the church—largesse! largesse! Beggarman. 'Fender of the church? ay! didn't I foretell when he gave me his cloak long ago, that he 'd come to be a shining 'fender of the church? and a saint and a glorious martyr into the bargain? Becket. So have I been, my friends, a very martyr! Mobs. Long live his grace the martyr! Becket. Martyrdom, which I joyed in for your sakes. Mobs. Heaven grant your Grace the joy of another! And soon!—Largesse! Becket. Thanks for your kindly wishes, though not words! Now cease from both. Clare. For more than either, say I, Thanks for their silence! 'tis the gratefuller. Becket. You have no cause to like it, Earl of Clare! Enter John of Oxford, Mapes, and De Broke, behind. Clare. My gracious lord, I hope yes; for the King Informs us here that we are to present Our kneeling griefs before your Sanctity, Which is oath-bound by covenant with him, Stricken of late at Fretville, to absolve Me and my Lord Justiciary from the censures Your ire pronounced against us. And we hope In virtue of your faith and our contrition, To be ta'en once more to the Church's bosom As well as your good favour. De Lucy. With my own, Here be petitions also on the part Of Hugh Earl Chester, Nigel de Sackville, Thomas Fitz-Bernard, and Archdeacon Radel, Whom the said covenant gives a similar claim. Becket. All of ye were accomplices and abettors In that most sacrilegious mummery titled The young king's Coronation; when, last June, Roger of York dared pour the royal unction (My privilege sole!) upon Prince Henry's head; For which the vial of wrath shall scald his own Into a leprosy!—I will absolve None of ye! 'Twas a covenant at discretion. Clare. What! are you desperate to bring fire and sword Into the kingdom? De Lucy. Is your olive-branch Trimm'd for a scourge? Becket. My congress hath of late Been with crown'd heads, wherefore I mell not now With coronetted ones! (To the crowd.) On Christmas day Be it well known, we shall anathematise Robert de Broke, and Ralph, besides some other Odd servants of the king. De Broke. O pardon! pardon! [Falling on his knees. Becket. Thou cry me pardon? that didst rend and ravin My diocese, the endowment of the Church, With hand, which should have wither'd in such act, Tearing the coat of Christ!—Even from now Be an abomination to man's eyes For ever! (De Broke attempts to mingle in the crowds, which shun him with all horror. He rushes out desperately.) Friends! let us forth upon our peaceful way Towards Woodstock, to confer with the young Regent About the Church's weal, including yours. Enter De Bohun, and Men-at-arms. De Bohun. Archbishop, his young Majesty commands You pass no further. Becket. Not with these rich presents I bear him as a sign of amity? Will he not be as placable as Becket? Although my spiritual thunders may have reft Three mitres from the usurpers of my state, That does not touch his crown. He is a king With my full secular consent; and soon Shall have my sacred benison. De Bohun. 'Tis well You think of it even now! When he shall hear This humble parley 'stead of the proud peals That swell'd with your approach, his horn may chime: Till then your Grace cannot pass on, nor enter Any king's burgh; but must return your steps To Canterbury straight, and keep the confines Of your own lands. Becket (aside). Here's my reward for humbleness! The virtue of the weak and mean and poor, A vice in Becket! (Aloud) Who dares stop my way, Sub-Vicar of St. Peter o'er this realm? De Bohun. Humfrey de Bohun, Lord High Constable, Of that same realm: a name and title proud As loyal subject ever wore!—Stand fast, My men-at-arms! Becket. Lord Constable, will ye Damn by this deed Humfrey de Bohun? De Bohun. No, do it thou!—thy lips are grown fire-proof With uttering fulminations that would blister A bugle's mouth to blast them forth.—Sound out, Trumpeters there! and pikemen, clear the way! [Trumpets drown the voice of Becket, who retires in furious chagrin before the advancing pikes. Monks, Crowds, and Bosham, follow. De Bohun. I did not like to let his dragon-tongue Hiss round us, and launch forth its sulphury flames To singe my ensign and appal my men: Tough Humfrey's self cares little for anathemas More than for old wives' blessings: both, foul wind! [Exit after the Soldiers. Clare. Mark'd you how pale and purple Becket grew By turns? De Lucy. I ne'er saw face so mortified! Mapes. It looked as grim and ghastly on his neck Which bore it up stone-stiff, with chin in air, As doth a felon's stuck o' the city gates. John of O. Now will he to his Saltwood shades, and make Black blood there; now he will spit venom at us, As strong with gall as ever oozed from heart So rancorous and so fester'd. Clare. Let it be! [Exeunt. SCENE V. The Queen's Apartment at Windsor. Eleanor. Prince Richard and Prince John at games. Eleanor. My doughty Urchin, that would thrust her head Into the snap-trap, comes not back. I guess'd Malice so sanguine defter to deceive Itself than others. Though she can transmute Those loose joints and flab features to all shapes But one not hideous,—such that I scarce know My own familiar devil when it appears, Deforming her deformity still more,— The hellicat hath been caught, and nine times kill'd, Else she had stolen to me ere now. I've lost My ablest minister, and must be henceforth Both council and executive myself. Yet I am all at fault!—They say this boy, In his wild hardihood, broke fence at Woodstock, For which the Warder sends him home but now: Perchance his errantry hath some apt thing Discover'd, and his innocence may betray it? Come hither, Dick Plantagenet! Richard. Madam, ay. Eleanor. So, sir, you broke into the Labyrinth? Richard. Yes. Eleanor. Spite of penalties which make me pale With fear.—Even to the Bowery Palace? Richard. Yes. Eleanor. Iron-head! And where then? Richard. Why to be sure Into the Bower itself!—O fairy-land! Eleanor. Well, and whom saw ye? Richard. Saw?—the Fairy Queen! At least the Queen of Fair Ones! Would I were But big enough to be her knight!—I'll tell you: As we sat feasting in her ‘chamber-precious’ (So it is call'd), with foliage all festoon'd, There was a maiden-blush hung by her cheek (Do ye know what a maiden-blush is, Madam?) And her cheek look'd the prettier rose of the two, Though white her brow as lily o' the valley. That is the reason, now I think of it, She is named Rosamond—fair Rosamond. Eleanor. O! 'twas the minion then herself! Richard. The minion? Minion! minion!—O you'd say Mignonne, French for our home-word, darling?—Yes, it was: Would I were with her now, instead of here! Eleanor. Couldst find thy way back thither, think you, lad, To feast in that same bower once more with her Your maggot-pate so runs on? Richard. Let me try! It has a thousand marks I can remember: Let me, good Mother! Eleanor. You'll take me along? Richard. You?—O you'd be a spoil-feast! You would sour The wine; and keep me much too strict; O, no! I could not take you with me. Eleanor. See what's here: A silver-hafted poll-axe, which I got Made for you, when you proved a docile boy. Richard. I am a docile boy: give it me straight! [Snatching it. Eleanor. Now what are those same marks which you remember To trace your path with through that winding maze?— Let me but reach its heart, and I shall soon Reach that of its foul Mistress! Richard. O ho, ho!— Yes, I have heard you are very jealous of her, Because she is so beautiful and young. Here, take your silver toy again!—My wooden one Can give as stout a thwack. I am no traitor! Eleanor. No, but a naughty rebel!—Tell me all Thou know'st, or I will cuff thee! Richard. Do, good Mother!— She 'll only hurt her hand upon my brawn, And cry for pain, when she can give me none! Eleanor (shaking him). Tell me, thou stubborn— Richard. Not one word of it! By Mahound I will not! Eleanor. Hear how the monkey Takes on the man! Talks of his maiden blushes, And swears his Mahounds and his Tyrmagaunts Like a bronzed warrior!—Incorrigible! Thou 'rt not my son! Richard. No! Sour-faced Jack i'the corner, He is your own, own son; I am the King's! Eleanor. Like him as lion's cub is to the lion, Tan-hair'd and huge-limb'd, hot-brain'd and head-strong. Richard. Yea, and heart-strong!—Did not Fair Rosamond Christen me Cœur-de-Lion? better I wot Than “duck” and “chick” you nickname brother John. Eleanor. And what so gallant had you done, that she So call'd you, my fine Squire of Dames? Richard. Your ear! Eleanor. Well? [Bending down. Richard. “Chantons Rolant! le preux et puissant!” [Shouting a song. Ha! ha! ha! ha! Eleanor. Get to thy chamber, thou unnatural knave! Thou shalt have bread and water for three days! Richard. Anything but the goodies you give John To gulp—panado and sweet pap—I hate them! “Chantons Rolant! le preux et puissant!” [Marches out singing, Eleanor following. Eleanor. Perverse, undutiful little villain! None Can tame him, save the king, and with a strength The father of his own. Get to thy chamber! SCENE VI. Porch of Westminster Abbey. A Snow-storm. De Broke outside on his knees, in squalid penitential attire. Enter persons of different ages, sexes, and conditions, who pass into the Church. Some turn away their heads from De Broke with horror and scorn and detestation; some hide their faces in their hands, some spit at him: the children throw ashes and filth, the old women scowl upon him, banning and reviling. A procession of Nuns, who all close their veils and make a sign of the cross as they go by him. A procession of Monks, who all pull over their cowls, and cross themselves; the last puts into De Broke's hand a scourge. Enter then a Laybrother going to the Refectory with provisions, on which he is regaling himself. De Broke (to the Laybrother). I starve! [The Laybrother flings a bare bone at him. De Broke. O mercy! but one drop to warm My freezing veins! [The Laybrother flings an empty flask at him, and exit. SCENE VII. Saltwood Grange in Kent. Monks and Serfs employed at rural labours. Becket and John of Salisbury girt up as woodcutters. John of S. O how it glads me, my dear lord, to see you Peacefully here among us! thus employ'd In labours wholesome to the body and mind Refreshing, sweetening, fortifying both, For blood the sap is of the total man Which feeds his powers throughout. Why do you start? Is not the pigmiest creature of us all In that a very Antæus, that he gathers New strength each time from Earth's maternal breast, When he is thrown upon it? Becket. You are classical! John of S. So says your lip, your nostril says—pedantic. 'Twas the fit word, 'twas the fit word in sooth! But these old fables, let me tell you, are Often of larger, richer truth than facts. Pass that!—I say our good St. Benedict Ne'er show'd himself more Solomon in his rules Than when he this enjoin'd upon his Order: Give your minds hands; marry the practical To the contemplative, that joint fruit may follow With all the juice of both, earthful, ethereal. Becket. 'Twas a good rule: so be it. John of S. Here as thou stand'st Amongst thy household, like a Patriarch, While clouds are thickening o'er us, I could deem thee A Noah, when heaven's flood about to burst, Ponder'd above the world. Becket. Let it come down, We are prepared for it! John of S. No, not quite yet: We must fall to a little. [Beginning to hew. Becket. Simpleton! He cannot understand this weighty moment When there 's a flood indeed may sweep us all Into confounding ruin. John of S. Is not this better, Drawing moist fragrance from the rural air Than adding our foul sweat to the reek o' the city? This hurtless war against the yielding trees, Than broils with kings and barons? Becket. John, I tell you, Hurtless as this cool war to you may seem, 'Twill end in blood! John of S. Blood?—I've read something Like it in Virgil. Becket. You are a dreamer, John! You know not what we speak of. I do tell ye This quarrel cannot end except in blood. Are you awake? have you no eyes? no ears? The King forswears himself, foregoes with me All his concessions, promises, oaths, pacts! Here am I sent to Saltwood home in shame By that miscrownèd Youth they call a King, Whom as a very mistress I set out To woo with flattering words and dazzling gifts! John of S. But where the need to dazzle him or flatter, If you brought honest homage, liege affection? Why did you, first, declining to absolve Those Bishops on their penitence, give cause King Harry should decline from favouring you? Becket. The Bishops!—John, there is some buzz abroad You would be one! John of S. I am to be, good sooth, By the King's gracious offer. Becket. Ay, indeed? Small wonder then you take his part against me! John of S. Becket, you could not such mean thoughts surmise In me, were all your own magnanimous! From heart unsound proceeds a breath which taints The fame it blows on. Did you whilome take The King's part, then, but to be made archbishop? I deem'd it was through conscience,—though you changed! Are these your acts, ostensive for the Church, But to exalt, enrich, empower yourself? In truth this has been “buzzed,” and loud enough, Yet with the bigotry of friendship, John Thought 'twas by wasps and idle gnats alone! Becket. Forgive me, John: but I feel even the globe Hollow beneath me; treason hems me round; Destruction hatches under mine own eaves, Broods in the grove beside us. Even the Church, False to herself, cannot be true to me: Doth she not now adulterate with the King, His Holiness being pandar? bribed thereto By his rich-worded promises to stop Fierce Barbarossa's rage,—a gilded bait Which only gudgeons catch at! Every Nuncio, Yea the whole Conclave, fill their purse with gems Torn from the English Mitre. Louis of France, My steadiest prop till now, begins to wax Rotten at core, and fails me at most need. Ah, simple John! the world is not so smooth As scholars dream. John of S. I did not say 'twas smooth, Unless men take it smoothly. Becket. Wise good man! (Aside.) Blockhead! who cannot see conspiracy Darken and thicken like those sinister rooks Upon the trees above us; nay, even hear it Croaking in hoarse accord, like them, for carnage! (Aloud.) I muse on what you say: how best to meet With calmest dignity the coming storm. 'Twill come, be sure, and soon: for I know well The king holds by his Constitutions yet Stubborn, as by his crown. 'Tis all cajolery This truce with Louis, with the Pope, with me; But to gain time and pick occasion For his unsleeping purpose. Becket alone Awakes to baffle it, and can, and will,— Let him thereafter sleep as dead a sleep As e'er laid head upon a pillow of dust! John of S. Not all alone: I'm with thee to the last! Becket. Come on, then! Thou shalt see my power compel This proud king on his knees to me, albeit The struggle lay me, too, breathless on earth! [Exit. John of S. Would there were less of passion and of pride In our self-sacrifice! oft made for self, For our own glorification, when we seem Devoted all for others! Yet he thinks It is the Church he serves, and if so, Heaven Pardon him if he hurts her in himself! [Exit. SCENE VIII. A Wood. Enter Fitz-Urse. Fitz-Urse. Here was our trysting-place; by that bald oak Riven from the crown to root; they could not miss it. So, you are come! Enter Brito. Brito. What cheer? Fitz-Urse. Eh! you can see: The place is white with bones left by wild hounds And ravens; there 's no other cheer for us. Brito. Sorry enough. Know you aught of the others? Fitz-Urse. Tortoises! slow worms! laggards! But what needs More than our two stout selves? Brito. Nay, the whole town Is for him: we must have a dozen more. If our friends come here and not find us, they Will raise the shire with noise. De Traci chatters More than a cage of monkeys: we must wait. Fitz-Urse. Heard you no trampling? Why do they bring their horses To litter here? Brito. Only a carrier: mark How cautiously he skirts the wood about; It is an ill-reputed place. Enter De Morville and De Traci. Fitz-Urse. Sirs, we had turn'd Almost to stocks and stones, with standing here In watch for you. De Traci. Pardon! good son of Urse. De Morville. Is all agreed? are we to kill him straight? Brito. Ay, if he do not yield. De Traci. Descend, or fall! De Morville. He'll never yield; it is as vain as praying This oak to bow, or be cut down. Fitz-Urse. Hark, gentlemen: Debate it as ye will, I am resolved: My king shall never say again before me, ‘Have I no friend will rid me of this pest?’ Brito. Ay, while he raised his passionate hands, to hear The Bishops' plaint. De Traci. And spake of ‘recreant knights!’ De Morville. Who were sustained by him, without sustaining! Fitz-Urse. Stop ye, or go? Strike, or shill-shall-I? All. On! [Exeunt. SCENE IX. A By-way in the Labyrinth. Eleanor and Dwerga. Dwerga. Hither, dull grandam!—this way; here 's the clue. See where it threads the quickset roots along Under those nettles, thistles, and rank weeds, Pale glittering like the Fatal Sisters' yarn Weft out of dead man's skin. Eleanor. 'Tis broken here. Dwerga. 'Tis thou, most sovereign beldam, art blear-sighted! I, as the dew-born spider, span it slim Out of my ropy venom, but scarce breakable. Peer, peer about!—there 'tis again: some reptile Hath dragg'd it thus awry. Eleanor. How didst thou manage To lay it so adroit? Dwerga. Even though mine eyes Were film'd with slime out of the leech-pond there, Into which that curst whelp of thee and Satan, Lubberly Dick (whom I will plague anon!), When blows had stunn'd me quite, couching his club, Butted poor Dwerga like a battering-ram!— Yet forth I trail'd me soon; and while these orbs Were dim as leaden ones, I laid the clue Sly as thou see'st it! Was it not well done? Eleanor. Shrewdly. Where is it now? Dwerga. Here, i' the ditch. O 'twas well done of Dwerga! as emball'd Urchin-like, she did bowl herself unseen By the dusk hedges and rush-cover'd channels, Out of the maze as she had trundled in! Hu! hu! hex! hex! Eleanor. The Bower! the Bower! Dwerga. Trot on! Now we shall have a frolic worth the venture!— Trot on, sweet grandam! [Sings. “Speckle-black toad and freckle-green frog,” &amp;c. Hu! hu! hex! [Exeunt. Scene changes to the Bower inside. Rosamond alone. Rosamond. My spirits are heavy, and they lend all things Their own dark nature! See how the evening sun Fills this green chamber with a golden gloom; The broider'd tapestry waves its lustrous folds Dismal, as o'er some breathless Dame laid here In proud, sad state; yon cricket chirps as loud And quick, as sounds a larum-bell by night; And when that sweet bird twitter'd past the bower, Methought it was the screech-owl. O how long Since I felt happy!—Since I left the heaven Of innocent girlhood, when even sorrow's drops Were bright and transient as an angel's tears. Can I not pray? When innocent, night and morn I always pray'd for happiness, and it came. Pray!—yet repent not of your sin!—Far worse Than the mute sin itself. I will go back To Godstowe once again; I will beseech The Nuns receive me as a truant wretch Weigh'd down to heart-prostration by my guilt, And there upon my face at Mercy's shrine Beg for an age of suffering to wash out The stain which blots my youth— Eleanor (from behind). Wash it out here, With this! (showing a phial). It is a lotion most abstersive; 'Twill cleanse you monumental-white, and save A world of holy water! Rosamond. Art thou a demon, Or Eleanor the Queen? Eleanor. Either you like, Or both, if it please you. There's my familiar! [Pointing at Dwerga Rosamond. Ah! fiend assured, that canst return from hell, Whither young Richard sent thee! Dwerga. Hu! hu! hex! Take to thy sucking-bottle, pretty child! Take to it, lovesome! 'Tis more precious milk Than the slow-dribbling poppy gives; yea better Than the black suckle from my dam I drew, Which makes me such a darling! Rosamond. Fearful thing! Comest thou to tear me through my opening grave Into the house of torment for my sins? Dwerga. Just so!—But feel how tenderly I'll grip Thy soft white limbs with my beak'd claws! No blood Shall ooze from them but I will kiss it up Fond as a gloating lover, and each wound Sear with hot caustic breath!—Try it, my sweetling! Rosamond. Save me, ah save me, thou more human form! [Kneeling to Eleanor. Dwerga. Let me upon her! my fangs itch. Eleanor. Abide: It were too soon to put her out of pain. Tell me, young Mistress!—Nay, keep on your knees; No succour hears thee; good Sir Fier-à-bras Has been grave-sick these three days, and no other Dares front the Queen;—tell me, thou smooth-faced Witch! What sorceries didst thou practise, to beguile My husband of his troth—what sinful arts? Rosamond. None, as I am most sinful, but what nature Taught him to wile me with—alas the day! Eleanor. Ay, wilt thou boast thee of thy natural charms Above all aid from art? Thou dog-briar Rose! Thou vile, poor, daggled, village-garden Rose! Thou stuck upon the bosom of a king, As the prime flower of England? Rosamond. All unmeet: But 'twas love, not ambition, fixed me there! Eleanor. Love! dost avouch it, brazen of tongue and brow Rosamond. Ay me, is ever truth a wrong? Eleanor. Audacious! Dost thou, a base-born peasant Girl, dare vie With Eleanor of Guienne for a king's heart? Rosamond. I am a daughter of De Clifford, dame! A high-born, high-soul'd race, till sunk in me. But farewell pride!—'tis for the pure alone; Vain flourish even for them, since humble or proud, We are all equal in our winding-sheets, The country-maid and queen! Eleanor. No rug, vile Wretch, Shall wind thy harlot corse! It shall be cast Upon the cross-road, as a gaze for men, A glut for dogs and daws! Rosamond. O Queen, some pity To thy own sex! Eleanor. That thy so vaunted beauty Be first the mock of every tongue, and end The horror of all eyes! Rosamond. O rather, rather Bury me breathing quick ten feet in earth, Build me up in these walls, and my last look Shall stare dumb pardon on thee! Eleanor. Drink off this!— Here 's a love-potion from me in return For that thou gavest the king, to warm his blood Tow'rds thee his paramour, freeze it towards his spouse. Drain it up, sorceress!—no words, no prayers! Rosamond. One moment, if thou 'rt not inexorable, To plead with Heaven. Eleanor. 'Tis deafer still than I! Rosamond. But to confess my sins— Eleanor. Fool, they are flagrant In hell itself renown'd!—Hither, good Fury! [To Dwerga. Howl through her brain, flame round her with your eyes, If she put off the cup once more, cling to her And poison her with your kisses! Dwerga. Let me! I'll screw Her soul out in my tortuous clasp— Rosamond. To the dregs! [She drinks off the poison. 'Tis bitter—as thy hate!—fierce—as thy rage! My head swims!—Mercy, Heaven!—Too cruel Queen! Relent when I am dead—O give me burial! Cast me not out to gaze—Henry! defender! The fiends are here!—Thy Rosamond is—no more! [Dies. Eleanor. The King's name on her lips even to the last! She shall bleach for it! Dwerga. There's a drying wind Out now, will make a precious mummy of her, And with her thus thou canst present the King To hang up in his cabinet as a study, Like a stuff'd alligator—hu! hu! hex! Eleanor. Fair Rosamond? Pale Rosamond, now, I ween! Dwerga. Foul Rosamond she shall be, foul as she fair had been!— There's a quaint rhyme for thee!—I will turn minstrel And make a doleful ditty of this drone— ‘Fair Rosamond done to death in her sweet Bower, By cruel Eleanor, that wicked Queen!’ It shall be famous! you shall have your meed, As Cain's most pitiless Daughter, from mankind! Eleanor. Make me not tremble, now I 've done the deed, With diabolic drolling: it and this Would give a stone the shudders. Let's begone! [Exit. Dwerga. I'll plague thee raving-mad with it each night, Till thou shalt wish to sleep as sound as she! Dwerga will be thy Incubus; and more, Thy Succubus too, fattening upon thy gall, And laughter at thy follies—hu! hu! hex! [Exit after her. SCENE X. An Inn on the Road near Canterbury. Enter a Pursuivant-at-Arms and an Ostler. Pursuivant. Get me another horse for the king's duty— all bone and sinew, hark'ee! Shift the housings from my jade, fit or no fit, and in a trice—if you wouldn't have your hands cut off and nailed behind you, like a kite's wings on a barn-door! Ostler. Yes, sir! (Aside) I'll bespeak you a toss i' the mire for that: the waters are out, you shall be made to play duck-and-drake in them! [Exit. Pursuivant. This crime will be consummate ere I reach them; And church, prince, people, overwhelm'd in sorrow: Themselves will walk the world with foreheads sear'd, Every man's hand against them. Fie on their zeal! Thus kings have ever-ready slaves to give Their words the worst translation into acts, For which the original's blamed: or vantage take Of royal ire to sate their rascal own. I fool the time!—My roadster, ho!—not yet? [Exit. SCENE XI. Canterbury. An Apartment in the Archiepiscopal Mansion. Becket, John of Salisbury, and Henry Bosham. John of S. I cannot cease my prayers—nay my rebukes, Though you of consecrated wisdom are Prime in all England. You have been too stern, Imperious and impatient with these men. I tell you they are not negotiators Commission'd by the king. Did you not mark That fellow whose straight, black brows, met i' the front, How he pursed up his lips, nor seem'd to hear One word, or pro or con, but kept his eyes Piercing the ground, his right hand on his hilts? Bosham. One Reginald Fitz-Urse. Becket. I know it well: Soldiers are cut-throats in the king's livery, Murderers whom the laws make gallows-free. John of S. Why then provoke them with such bitter taunts, Such scorn intolerant and intolerable?— [Noise without. They are return'd!—I knew it! Bosham. My dear lord, I'm a weak timorous scholar; but for you Feel myself strong both arm and soul to die: 'Tis not my cowardice speaks—flee, flee, dear Master! Becket. Becket resists the Devil, and He shall flee! Enter Gryme hastily. Gryme. To the Church! to sanctuary! fly! fly! fly! Becket. Have they got in? Gryme. De Broke, that privy traitor, Mad to be excommuned beyond all grace, Hath join'd, and leads them up the postern-stairs, When we had barr'd the portal. Becket. How soon, think you, Will they have burst their way to us? Gryme. Five doors! Becket. Five oaken, clouted doors?—Fetch me my robes. John of S. My gracious lord—my friend—upon my knees— [Kneeling to him. Becket. Richard, obey me!—All in time, good John! Get up and help me to array. [Noise without. My alb— My pall—my sandals; let me have the mitre— You hurry, John: be calm; more haste worse speed! Now, where 's my crosier? [Noise approaches. Henry Bosham, you Go to my almery, here 's the key (remember 'Tis somewhat stiff, so force it not!), and fetch me My emperor of rings, bright Peretot, Jewelry-all— [Exit Bosham, and soon returns. John of S. (to himself). I know not which to name it, Grandeur of soul or pettiness, pride of state, Contempt of peril, calm from sense of right, Or contradictiveness insane! Becket (putting on the ring). I'm ready. Nay, my precedence is to be preceded, The greatest comes the last. Go ye before me. [Exeunt. Fitz-Urse, De Morville, De Traci, Brito, De Broke, and others, break in. Conspirators. Where is the traitor? where? where? he is fled! De Broke. Here is a secret passage to the Church: Thither the wild beast scours as to his den, I'll wind it like a terrier after him, And lead the pack into his very lair: Follow me, friends! [Exeunt. SCENE XII. St. Benedict's Chapel in the Cathedral. Becket before the Altar. John of Salisbury, Bosham, Gryme. Becket. Who closed that door?—Open it, I command! What! will ye make a Castle of a Church? The Conspirators rush in. De Traci. Where is the traitor? Brito. Where is the Archbishop? Becket. Here am I, an Archbishop, but no traitor! De Morville. Will you absolve the Prelates? Becket. No! Brito. Will you to Winchester, And beg the young King's grace, for your attempt Most traitorous to discrown him? Becket. I made none, And will beg grace of none, save God on high! De Traci. You are my prisoner;—come along, proud traitor! Becket. Take off that impious hand, which dares profane My stole immaculate; or I will shake thee, Vile reptile, off, and trample thee in the dust! Bosham, let be!—I have an arm as stout As any stalking Norman of them all!— Away! [He casts De Traci from him, who draws. De Traci. (Aiming at Becket, strikes off the arm of Richard Gryme.) Get thee a wooden one, thou false confessor, To bless thee with! thou supple, whispering knave! Becket and his friends are assaulted by the Conspirators, many of whom Becket overthrows. Fitz-Urse. Here strikes King Harry! [Cleaving Becket down. Becket. Execrabilis esto! [Dies. Scene closes. SCENE XIII. Before the Cathedral. Enter Pursuivant as from the Porch. Pursuivant. Too late! too late! O how the King will grieve! O murderous sacrilege! beyond all tongues To cry out aught upon but Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe to both king and kingdom! Years of tears Will not from yonder chapel-floor wash out The bloody desecration of such blots As make the heart bleed through the eyes to see them!— Woe to the nation, woe! [Exit. SCENE XIV. St. Benedict's Chapel. The ceremony of a Lustration performed by Monks and secular Clergy. A procession. SCENE XV. Choir of Canterbury Cathedral: to the left St. Benedict's Chapel. Becket's Corpse on a bier. Crowds of visitors, some gazing at the death-place, some at the body, or paying it veneration by kneeling around it, touching it, kissing the Primatial robes, insignia, &amp;c. John of Salisbury. Bosham. John of Oxford. John of S. Lo! how the multitude flock in!—'Tis strange This thing so soon was known; Bosham and I Were too heart-sick to speak of it; and Gryme Is in a trance of agony even yet, Through loss of limb and lord. John of O. When did it happen? John of S. Near about Vesper time. John of O. Methinks the news Spread with the curfew knell over all England, Even in a moment: 'twas miraculous! I heard it scarce more late at London Tower; And deem'd it that strange mockery of sound Which oft its echoing shell makes of our ear, Or yet more strange intelligence presaged By what we dread is true;—but every face Round me was pale-struck also, each foot stopt Howe'er precipitate, hands were half raised, Or placed to still the beatings of the heart, As if some thunderous blare had rent the sky And all drew breath to hear the Doom-word follow. John of S. Most strange! Both town and country are afoot; You'd think an earthquake of the total Isle Had roused them from their beds. See how they troop, Jostling with fear, haste, and confusion. John of O. The place will be a pilgrimage ere long, So reverenced was this man. John of S. And is the more That Death enrolls him now among the Martyrs. Some royalty has enter'd, to do honour, Or mourn with us—alas! alas! John of O. The Queen. Eleanor approaches hastily, and kneels at the foot of the bier. John of S. How very white her Highness looks! John of O. Nay, haggard; She must be wayworn sadly. Hark! she mutters: Does she forget she's in a crowd and church? Not at her priedieu? Eleanor. O most holy Becket! Pray for me, make my peace with ireful heaven, Thou who hast now such influence o'er the Saints As new amongst them, and above them all Rank'd by thy bleeding crown of Martyrdom!— Eleanor is uneasy in her soul: Give me some sign of favour, and thy tomb I'll circle with an orb of golden urns Flaming perpetual incense! Tell me how To quell this troublous spirit. [The Shade of Rosamond rises at the head of the Bier. Shade. Pitiless Queen! How canst thou hope repose unto thy spirit, Denying it to my unhappy clay! Eleanor. Help to the Queen of England!—Guards there!—help! Stand between her and me! Let her not gaze So ghastly on me thus! John of S. Who is it offends Your grace! Eleanor. She!—she!—that fixes on me there Her marble eyes. John of S. 'Tis but the statued form Of a young Martyress. Eleanor. I know it well, Hate's martyress and mine!—Fair Rosamond! Art thou not she? Shade. Rosamond once called Fair! Poor Rosamond who never wish'd thee harm! Thy husband loved thee not, and 'twas 'gainst thee Small crime, that faith, thou nor preserved nor prized, Plighted itself to me.—My death was merciless Beyond all need or measure: that fierce drink Which rack'd me inwardly and warped my form Unseemliest to behold, might have been spared, For thy fierce words had slain me. Eleanor. 'Twas not I Prepared the drug—false Geber, the physician! Shade. Is this pale presence dreadful as the fear Of that grim fiend thou brought'st to torture me Before my time in hell? Eleanor. The fiend-like creature Work'd me to work thy death—I was her slave! John of S. List how to her own fearful Fantasy She shrives herself!—'Tis a sad self-exposure. Shade. I am fate's herald here: Thy name shall stand A breviary of all abhorr'd in woman; Thy memory shall be made eterne on earth By the immortal hatred of mankind. Thou shalt be still the slavish tool of those Who serve, to mock thee; and thy wickedness Shall be the womb of what shall breed thee woe. Thy Eldest Son,—his nature weak, by thee Distempered,—shall die ere his prime; thy Second In it, by death ignoble, after a flourish Glorious though brief, and spirit gall'd with chains; Early and sadly shall thy Third Son perish, Thy Grand-child too, earlier, sadder still, Blasting the hopes of England in their flower. Thy Fourth, thy other self in manlike form, Thine idol, because thine own image true, Shall live as miserable from his crimes, His mean, low, lustful, jealous, coward heart, As thou from thine; and meet a similar death To that thou wrought'st for me, but wretcheder still, Unpitied his by all the world, as mine By thee alone! Eleanor. I am relentful now!— Thy corse shall virginly be deckt—be borne With richest care to Godstowe, and interr'd Like an apparent sovereign, as thou wert In thine own chapel—so thou wilt not haunt me! Shade. Let decent rite and ceremonial due Be paid, even to the lowliest form of dust That Heaven's breath sanctified though sin defiled, As to the mightiest. 'Tis a solemn claim Humanity has upon humanity; And thou wilt do no worse fulfilling it, Than offering base obeisance to this clay, A servile adoration and absurd, Dishonouring those who render and receive it.— Prosper as thou deserv'st. I leave thee now. [Vanishes. John of O. The Queen faints: bear her to the open cloister! [She is borne off. John of S. My friend, and my heart's Daughter, in one day Lost to me, both!—I have done some great wrong, And will repent for it, though I know it not. O what will say the King? He 'll be the sufferer, First in himself, then through his people all; His penance will be bitterest that e'er man Endured for weetless sin or wilful crime. Scene Closes. THE END.</field>
